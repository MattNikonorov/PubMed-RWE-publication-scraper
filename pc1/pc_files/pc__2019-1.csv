We hypothesized that escalating the dose per fraction (fx) to the PF would have acceptable toxicity.  Materials and methods:   Tested dose levels (DLs) were 3.6 Gy × 15 fx (DL1); 4.7 Gy × 10 fx (DL2); and 7.1 Gy × 5 fx (DL3). Escalation followed a 6 + 6 rules-based design with 12 patients required at the maximum tolerated dose. Dose-limiting toxicity was defined as grade (G) ≥3, gastrointestinal (GI) or genitourinary (GU) toxicity by National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (version 4.03). Patients completed quality-of-life questionnaires.  Results:   Twenty-four patients with indications for adjuvant or salvage radiation therapy (RT) enrolled (6 at DL1 and 2; 12 at DL3). All patients had at least 6 months of follow-up (median follow-up, 14.1 months). Four patients received concurrent androgen deprivation therapy. No G ≥ 3 GI or GU toxicity was seen at any DL; 2 of 6 patients in the DL1 group, 3 of 6 in DL2, and 7 of 12 in DL3 experienced G2 GI toxicity during RT. Except in 1 patient, all acute G2 GI toxicity resolved by 10 weeks. Three of 12 patients reported an increase to G1 and G2 GU toxicity in the 2 weeks after RT in groups DL1 and DL2 and 1 of 12 patients in DL3. At week 2 after RT, decline in the 26-item Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite bowel domain met criteria for a minimally important difference in 71% of patients. At week 10, 1 of 6, 2 of 6, and 7 of 11 patients at DLs 1, 2, and 3, respectively, still met minimally important difference criteria. International Prostate Symptom Scores worsened 2 weeks after treatment but improved by 6 to 10 weeks.  Conclusions:   Dose escalation up to 7.1 Gy × 5 fx to the PF was completed without acute G ≥ 3 toxicity. There was transient G2 rectal toxicity at all DLs during and immediately after RT. We must perform long-term follow-up and assessment of late toxicity of SBRT to the PF.""","""['Leslie K Ballas', 'Chunqiao Luo', 'Eugene Chung', 'Amar U Kishan', 'Igor Shuryak', 'David I Quinn', 'Tanya Dorff', 'Shamim Jhimlee', 'Raymond Chiu', 'Andre Abreu', 'Richard Jennelle', 'Monish Aron', 'Susan Groshen']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys""","""['Hypofractionated Postprostatectomy Radiation Therapy for Prostate Cancer to Reduce Toxicity and Improve Patient Convenience: A Phase 1/2 Trial.', 'Hypofractionated Radiation Therapy to the Prostate Bed With Intensity-Modulated Radiation Therapy (IMRT): A Phase 2 Trial.', 'A Prospective Single-Arm Phase 2 Study of Stereotactic Magnetic Resonance Guided Adaptive Radiation Therapy for Prostate Cancer: Early Toxicity Results.', 'Moderate hypofractionation and stereotactic body radiation therapy in the treatment of prostate cancer.', 'Role of Dose Intensification for Salvage Radiation Therapy after Radical Prostatectomy.', 'Preliminary Analysis of a Phase II Trial of Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy for Prostate Cancer With High-Risk Features After Radical Prostatectomy.', ""Three Months' PSA and Toxicity from a Prospective Trial Investigating STereotactic sAlvage Radiotherapy for Macroscopic Prostate Bed Recurrence after Prostatectomy-STARR (NCT05455736)."", 'Acute Toxicity and Quality of Life in a Post-Prostatectomy Ablative Radiation Therapy (POPART) Multicentric Trial.', 'A Phase 1 Trial of Highly Conformal, Hypofractionated Postprostatectomy Radiation Therapy.', 'Editorial: Stereotactic body radiotherapy for prostate cancer.']"""

The glycolytic environment has been shown to influence the efficacy of anti-cancer drugs. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of imatinib on cell viability, apoptosis, and metabolism in cell line models of castrate-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) under hyperglycemic and hypoglycemic conditions.  Main methods:   DU145 and PC3 CRPC cell lines were exposed to 20 μM imatinib under 5 mM (hypoglycemia) or 30 mM glucose (hyperglycemia) for 48-72 h. Cell viability was assessed by the MTS assay. The expression of apoptosis regulators and glycolytic metabolism-related proteins was analysed by Western blot, and the activity of caspase-3 and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) was determined spectrophotometrically. Glucose consumption and lactate production were determined using biochemical assays.  Key findings:   Imatinib decreased CRPC cells viability, whereas increasing apoptosis; effects only observed in hyperglycemic conditions. Glucose consumption and lactate production were significantly increased in imatinib-treated DU145 and PC3 cells, and independently of glucose availability. Accordingly, LDH expression and activity were significantly increased in response to imatinib.  Significance:   Higher glucose availability improved the effectiveness of imatinib suppressing survival and growth of CRPC cells. It was also shown that imatinib treatment stimulated the glycolytic metabolism of CRPC cells. This study first demonstrated that a glucose-enriched environment intensifies the effect of imatinib, which stimulates the interest for testing this compound into the clinical setting, namely in hyperglycemia conditions (diabetic patients) or in co-administration with inhibitors of glycolytic metabolism.""","""['Henrique J Cardoso', 'Cátia V Vaz', 'Tiago M A Carvalho', 'Marília I Figueira', 'Sílvia Socorro']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Life Sci""","""['Paradoxical and contradictory effects of imatinib in two cell line models of hormone-refractory prostate cancer.', 'Androgens enhance the glycolytic metabolism and lactate export in prostate cancer cells by modulating the expression of GLUT1, GLUT3, PFK, LDH and MCT4 genes.', 'Efficacy of the dual PI3K and mTOR inhibitor NVP-BEZ235 in combination with imatinib mesylate against chronic myelogenous leukemia cell lines.', 'Endothelial cell metabolism and implications for cancer therapy.', 'Effects of hyperglycemia on the progression of tumor diseases.', 'Glutaminolysis is a metabolic route essential for survival and growth of prostate cancer cells and a target of 5α-dihydrotestosterone regulation.', 'Glycolysis-induced drug resistance in tumors-A response to danger signals?', 'The metabolic role of PFKFB4 in androgen-independent growth in vitro and PFKFB4 expression in human prostate cancer tissue.']"""

Guidelines standardising the gross handling and reporting of pelvic LN dissection (PLND) in prostate (PCa) and bladder (BCa) cancer are currently lacking. This study aimed to establish current practice patterns of PLND evaluation among pathologists.  Methods and results:   A web-based survey was circulated to all members of the European Network of Uropathology (ENUP), comprising 29 questions focusing on the macroscopic handling, LN enumeration and reporting of PLND in PCa and BCa. Two hundred and eighty responses were received from pathologists throughout 23 countries. Only LNs palpable at grossing were submitted by 58%, while 39% routinely embedded the entire specimen. Average LN yield from PLND was ≥10 LNs in 56% and <10 LNs in 44%. Serial section(s) and immunohistochemistry were routinely performed on LN blocks by 42% and <1% of respondents, respectively. To designate a LN microscopically, 91% required a capsule/subcapsular sinus. In pN+ cases, 72% reported the size of the largest metastatic deposit and 94% reported extranodal extension. Isolated tumour cells were interpreted as pN1 by 77%. Deposits identified in fat without associated lymphoid tissue were reported as tumour deposits (pN0) by 36% and replaced LNs (pN+) by 27%. LNs identified in periprostatic fat were included in the PLND LN count by 69%.  Conclusion:   This study highlights variations in practice with respect to the gross sampling and microscopic evaluation of PLND in urological malignancies.

One may choose between surgical and medical forms depending on his economic status, education status, and taboos. The aim of this study was to assess the impact of medical versus surgical ADT on health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in patients with metastatic cancer prostate in Indian population.  Materials and methods:   From July 2012 to December 2014, 50 patients (10 medical castration and 40 surgical castration) of hormone-naïve metastatic prostate cancer who were started on combined ADT were included in this study. Before starting therapy, baseline data and QoL score (short form [SF-36] scale) were noted and all patients were followed up at 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year. Baseline data and HRQoL at all time intervals between surgical and medical castration groups were compared.  Results:   All patients, except two, completed the 1-year follow-up period. Patients who opted for medical castration were more educated and belonged to higher socioeconomic status. For all the domains of SF-36 QoL questionnaire, a similar improvement in the score was noted at first 3-month follow-up which deteriorated in the next follow-up at 6 months and then further at 1 year. There was no difference in HRQoL after medical or surgical castration.  Conclusions:   In patients with metastatic cancer, prostate initiation of ADT, irrespective of method, causes an initial improvement in HRQoL followed later by a more gradual decline below the baseline.""","""['Prabhjot Singh', 'Tapan Agrawal', 'Siddharth Yadav', 'Brusabhanu Nayak', 'Amlesh Seth', 'Prem Nath Dogra']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Indian J Cancer""","""['Knowledge and Attitudes Regarding Surgical Castration in Men Receiving Androgen Deprivation Therapy for Metastatic Prostate Cancer and Their Relationship to Health-Related Quality of Life.', 'Anticancer Activity and Tolerance of Treatments Received Beyond Progression in Men Treated Upfront with Androgen Deprivation Therapy With or Without Docetaxel for Metastatic Castration-naïve Prostate Cancer in the GETUG-AFU 15 Phase 3 Trial.', 'Quality of life in low-income men after surgical castration for metastatic prostate cancer.', 'Intermittent androgen-deprivation therapy in prostate cancer: a critical review focused on phase 3 trials.', 'Intermittent androgen deprivation therapy for prostate cancer: translating randomized controlled trials into clinical practice.', 'Cancer services in Sri Lanka: current status and future directions.']"""

A total of 292 men with any biopsy-proven PCa (TanyNanyMany) from 12 institutions in Korea were included in this multi-institutional, observational study of prospectively collected data. All luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonists were allowed to be investigational drugs. Efficacy was defined as (1) the rate of castration (serum testosterone ≤50 ng dl-1) at 4-week visit and (2) breakthrough (serum testosterone >50 ng dl-1 after castration). Safety assessments included routine examinations for potential adverse events, laboratory tests, blood pressure, body weight, and bone mineral density (BMD, at baseline and at the last follow-up visit). QoL was assessed using the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite-26 (EPIC-26). The most common initial therapeutic regimen was LHRH agonist with anti-androgen (78.0%), and the most commonly used LHRH agonist for combination and monotherapy was leuprolide (64.0% for combination and 58.0% for monotherapy). The castration and breakthrough rates were 78.4% and 6.6%, respectively. The laboratory results related to dyslipidemia worsened after 4 weeks of hormone treatment. In addition, the mean BMD T-score was significantly lower at the last follow-up (mean: -1.950) compared to baseline (mean: -0.195). The mean total EPIC-26 score decreased from 84.8 (standard deviation [s.d.]: 12.2) to 78.3 (s.d.: 8.1), with significant deterioration only in the urinary domain (mean: 23.5 at baseline and 21.9 at the 4-week visit).

Methods:   We identified 148 mCRPC patients who were treated with 75 mg/m2 docetaxel. We defined 16 months as the threshold for the effective duration of ADT, and defined 12 months as the cut-off time for starting docetaxel from the onset of CRPC. Univariate and multivariate analyses were conducted to investigate the prognostic indicators that influenced the survival outcomes.  Results:   Overall, 81 (54.7%) patients died. The median 1st ADT response was 22.2 months and the median time interval from CRPC onset to docetaxel treatment was 11.7 months. Multivariate analysis indicated that visceral metastasis, bone metastasis extent of disease (EOD) ≥ 2, and effective duration of ADT < 16 months were the independent prognostic indicators for progression-free survival (PFS). Referring to cancer-specific survival (CSS), besides visceral metastasis and effective duration of ADT < 16 months, late docetaxel treatment ≥ 12 months became as the predictors for poor prognosis.

Methods:   Four novel Glu-urea-based ligands containing the chelators p-SCN-Bn-TCMC or DO3AM were synthesized. Affinity and PSMA-specific internalization were studied in C4-2 cells, and biodistribution in C4-2 tumour-bearing mice. The most promising compound, 203Pb-CA012, was transferred to clinical use. Two patients underwent planar scintigraphy scans at 0.4, 4, 18, 28 and 42 h after injection, together with urine and blood sampling. The time-activity curves of source organs were extrapolated from 203Pb to 212Pb and the calculated residence times of 212Pb were forwarded to its unstable daughter nuclides. QDOSE and OLINDA were used for dosimetry calculations.  Results:   In vitro, all ligands showed low nanomolar binding affinities for PSMA. CA09 and CA012 additionally showed specific ligand-induced internalization of 27.4 ± 2.4 and 15.6 ± 2.1 %ID/106 cells, respectively. The 203Pb-labelled PSMA ligands were stable in serum for 72 h. In vivo, CA012 showed higher specific uptake in tumours than in other organs, and particularly showed rapid kidney clearance from 5.1 ± 2.5%ID/g at 1 h after injection to 0.9 ± 0.1%ID/g at 24 h. In patients, the estimated effective dose from 250-300 MBq of diagnostic 203Pb-CA012 was 6-7 mSv. Assuming instant decay of daughter nuclides, the equivalent doses projected from a therapeutic activity of 100 MBq of 212Pb-CA012 were 0.6 SvRBE5 to the red marrow, 4.3 SvRBE5 to the salivary glands, 4.9 SvRBE5 to the kidneys, 0.7 SvRBE5 to the liver and 0.2 SvRBE5 to other organs; representative tumour lesions averaged 13.2 SvRBE5 (where RBE5 is relative biological effectiveness factor 5). Compared to clinical experience with 213Bi-PSMA-617 and 225Ac-PSMA-617, the projected maximum tolerable dose was about 150 MBq per cycle.  Conclusion: 212Pb-CA012 is a promising candidate for PSMA-targeted alpha therapy of prostate cancer.

We aimed to study the quality of life (QoL), through questionnaires, comparing different functional outcomes after TaTME and LaTME.  Methods:   Consecutive patients who underwent TME between 2010 and 2017 at Slagelse Hospital, Denmark, were included based on certain criteria. Patients were divided according to the surgical technique (TaTME vs LaTME). The study was based on telephone interviews using the questionnaires: EORTC-QLQ C30, EORTC-QLQ C29, Low Anterior Resection Syndrome (LARS) score, and International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) for male patients. Patients in this study had a follow-up time of at least 8 months.  Results:   Overall, global health status was similar between the groups (p = 0.625). Anorectal symptoms were significantly in disfavor of TaTME including buttock pain (p = 0.011), diarrhea (p = 0.009), clustering of stools (p = 0.017), and urgency (p = 0.032), yet total LARS score was comparable (p = 0.054).

In subgroup analysis, HIFU provided significantly reduced CSS for intermediate- (p = 0.010) and high-risk patients (p = 0.048); whereas no difference was observed in the low-risk group, intermediate-risk HIFU patients showed a significantly inferior STS (p = 0.040).  Conclusions:   While whole gland HIFU offers a comparable long-term efficacy for low-risk patients, sufficient cancer control for high-risk patients is more than doubtful. For the subgroup of intermediate-risk patients, CSS rates seem to be comparable up to 10 years suggesting that HIFU may be an alternative for older patients, although a higher risk of salvage treatment should be expected.""","""['Bernd Rosenhammer', 'Roman Ganzer', 'Florian Zeman', 'Theresa Näger', 'Hans-Martin Fritsche', 'Andreas Blana', 'Maximilian Burger', 'Johannes Bründl']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""World J Urol""","""['Oncological Long-term Outcome After Whole-gland High-intensity Focused Ultrasound for Prostate Cancer-21-yr Follow-up.', 'Salvage high-intensity focused ultrasound versus salvage radical prostatectomy for radiation-recurrent prostate cancer: a comparative study of oncological, functional, and toxicity outcomes.', 'Oncological and functional outcomes of elderly men treated with HIFU vs. minimally invasive radical prostatectomy: A propensity score analysis.', 'Treatment of localized prostate cancer with high-intensity focused ultrasound.', 'Current salvage methods for recurrent prostate cancer after failure of primary radiotherapy.', 'Immune checkpoint inhibition: a future guided by radiology.', 'High intensity focused ultrasound for the treatment of solid tumors: a pilot study in canine cancer patients.', 'Comparing the toxicity and disease control rate of radiotherapy for prostate cancer between salvage settings after high-intensity focused ultrasound therapy and initial settings.', 'Applications of Focused Ultrasound in the Treatment of Genitourinary Cancers.', 'The primary treatment of prostate cancer with high-intensity focused ultrasound: A systematic review and meta-analysis.']"""

Since cabazitaxel has also been demonstrated to inhibit androgen receptor (AR) functionality, AR and AR-associated heat shock protein (HSP) expressions in the presence of cabazitaxel were characterized.  Methods:   AR and HSP expressions were assessed via Western blotting utilizing a PC-cell-line in vitro system incubated with cabazitaxel.  Results:   Incubation experiments with 0.3 nM cabazitaxel exhibited significantly reduced levels of AR and the AR-associated factors HSP90α, HSP40, and HSP70/HSP90 organising protein. Furthermore, expression of the anti-apoptotic factor HSP60 was suppressed. In contrast to other anticancer compounds, cabazitaxel did not alter the cytoprotective chemoresistance factor HSP27.  Conclusions:   Despite the deregulation of microtubule organisation, cabazitaxel has been shown to suppress the expression of HSP. Very notably, and may be as a result of down-regulated HSP, cabazitaxel additionally inhibits the expression of the AR in AR-positive PC cells.

PLZF loss induces an in vitro phenotype of castration resistance and enzalutamide resistance. The association of low expression of PLZF and clinical outcomes is unclear.  Methods:   We assessed PLZF mRNA expression in patients diagnosed with primary prostate cancer during prospective follow-up of the Health Professionals Follow-up Study (HPFS; n = 254) and the Physicians' Health Study (PHS; n = 150), as well as in The Cancer Genome Atlas (n = 333). We measured PTEN status (using copy numbers and IHC) and transcriptional activation of the MAPK pathway. Patients from HPFS and PHS were followed for metastases and prostate cancer-specific mortality (median, 15.3 years; 113 lethal events).  Results: PLZF mRNA expression was lower in tumors with PLZF deletions. There was a strong, positive association between intratumoral androgen receptor (AR) signaling and PLZF expression. PLZF expression was also lower in tumors with PTEN loss. Low PLZF expression was associated with higher MAPK signaling. Patients in the lowest quartile of PLZF expression compared with those in the highest quartile were more likely to develop lethal prostate cancer, independent of clinicopathologic features, Gleason score, and AR signaling (odds ratio, 3.17; 95% confidence interval, 1.32-7.60).

Materials and methods:   A retrospective study was performed on all kidney transplant recipients from a National Kidney Transplant Centre who were subsequently diagnosed with prostate cancer. Primary outcome variables included comparisons of incidence and 5-year overall survival in kidney transplant recipients versus nonrecipients after treatment of prostate cancer. Secondary outcome variables were prostate-specific antigen levels at diagnosis, Gleason grade, treatment strategy, and morbidity from treatment among kidney transplant recipients.  Results:   Of 4048 kidney transplants performed, 3020 were male recipients (63.9%). In total, 34 kidney transplant recipients (1.1%) were diagnosed with prostate cancer 109 ± 83 months (range, 7-372 mo) after transplant. The mean age at prostate cancer diagnosis was 64 ± 7 years, median prostate-specific antigen level was 10 ng/dL (range, 2.6-771 ng/dL), and 76% (n = 26/34) were diagnosed with localized disease. The incidence of prostate cancer was 1126/100 000 in kidney transplant recipients compared with 160/100 000 nonrecipients in Ireland (P = .01). Treatment strategies included curative radiotherapy (n = 18), curative surgery (n = 2), androgen deprivation therapy (n = 8), and watchful waiting (n = 6).

Rodent models of ADT have demonstrated that the levator ani is exquisitely androgen sensitive.  Objective:   To determine whether the high androgen responsiveness of the levator ani muscle documented in rodents is evolutionarily conserved and ADT is associated with a selective loss in leg muscle volume.  Design:   Prospective longitudinal case-control study.  Setting:   Tertiary referral hospital.  Participants:   Thirty-four men newly beginning ADT and 29 age-matched controls with PCa.  Main outcome measures:   The muscle volumes in liters of the levator ani and primary muscles involved in walking (iliopsoas, quadriceps, gluteus maximus, gluteus medius, calf).  Results:   Compared with controls, during a 12-month period, men receiving ADT experienced a mean reduction in total testosterone from 14.1 to 0.4 nmol/L and demonstrated greater decreases in levator ani [mean adjusted difference (MAD), -0.005 L; 95% CI, -0.007 to -0.002; P = 0.002; -16% of initial median value], gluteus maximus (MAD, -0.032 L; 95% CI, -0.063 to -0.002; P = 0.017; -5% of initial median value), iliopsoas (MAD, -0.005 L; 95% CI, -0.001 to 0.000; P = 0.013; -5% of initial median value), and quadriceps (MAD, -0.050 L; 95% CI, -0.088 to -0.012; P = 0.031; -3% of initial median value). No substantial differences were observed in the gluteus medius and calf muscles.  Conclusions:   The androgen responsiveness of the levator ani appears to be evolutionarily conserved in humans.

Therapies for cHSA are generally ineffective, in part due to advanced clinical disease stage at the time of diagnosis. The validation of conventional molecular methods for detecting novel biomarkers preferentially expressed by cHSA could lead to more timely diagnosis, earlier therapeutic interventions, and improved outcomes. In humans, prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) is a transmembrane protein overexpressed by prostate carcinoma and tumor-associated endothelium of various solid cancer histologies. Importantly, the preferential overexpression of PSMA by certain cancers has been leveraged for the development of diagnostic molecular imaging reagents and targeted therapeutics. Recently, PSMA has been qualitatively demonstrated to be expressed in cHSA cell lines, however, quantitative PSMA expressions and the potential utility of PSMA transcript identification in biologic fluids to support the presence of microscopic cHSA burden has not been reported. Therefore, this study sought to characterize the differential quantitative expressions of PSMA between cHSA and non-malignant tissues, and to determine the potential diagnostic utility of PCR-generated PSMA amplicons as a surrogate of rare cHSA cells dwelling within peritoneal and pericardial cavities.  Methods:   Quantitative gene and protein expressions for PSMA were compared between one normal endothelial and six cHSA cell lines by RT-PCR, western blot analysis, and fluorescent microscopy. Additionally, gene and protein expressions of PSMA in normal canine tissues were characterized. Graded expressions of PSMA were determined in spontaneously-arising cHSA tumor samples and the feasibility of qualitative PCR as a molecular diagnostic to detect PSMA transcripts in whole blood from healthy dogs and hemorrhagic effusions from cHSA-bearing dogs were evaluated.  Results:   PSMA gene and protein expressions were elevated (up to 6-fold) in cHSA cells compared with non-malignant endothelium. By immunohistochemistry, protein expressions of PSMA were detectable in all cHSA tissue samples evaluated. As predicted by human protein atlas data, PSMA's expression was comparably identified at substantial levels in select normal canine tissues including kidney, liver, and intestine. In young healthy pet dogs, PSMA amplicons could not be identified in circulating whole blood yet were detectable in hemorrhagic effusions collected from pet dogs with confirmed cHSA or PSMA-expressing cancer.  Conclusions:   PSMA is quantitatively overexpressed in cHSA compared to normal endothelium, but its protein expression is not restricted to only cHSA tumor tissues, as specific visceral organs also substantively express PSMA. Optimized qualitative PCR methods failed to amplify PSMA amplicons sufficiently for visible detection in circulating whole blood derived from healthy young dogs, yet PSMA transcripts were readily identifiable in hemorrhagic effusions collected from pet dogs with histologically confirmed cHSA or PSMA-expressing cancer. While preliminary, findings derived from a limited cohort of normal and diseased pet dogs provocatively raise the potential value of PSMA amplicon detection as an ancillary molecular diagnostic test for supporting the presence of microscopic cHSA disease burden within hemorrhagic body cavity effusions.""","""['Matthew Dowling', 'Jonathan Samuelson', 'Bahaa Fadl-Alla', 'Holly C Pondenis', 'Mark Byrum', 'Anne M Barger', 'Timothy M Fan']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Cloning and characterization of canine prostate-specific membrane antigen.', 'Biochemical characterization of prostate-specific membrane antigen from canine prostate carcinoma cells.', 'Targeting tumor vasculature with aptamer-functionalized doxorubicin-polylactide nanoconjugates for enhanced cancer therapy.', 'Prostate-specific Membrane Antigen PET: Clinical Utility in Prostate Cancer, Normal Patterns, Pearls, and Pitfalls.', 'Current use of PSMA-PET in prostate cancer management.', 'Investigating PSMA differential expression in canine uroepithelial carcinomas to aid disease-based stratification and guide therapeutic selection.', '18F DCFPyL PSMA avid biopsy proven subcutaneous capillary haemangioma as a malignancy mimic in the setting of biochemical recurrent prostate carcinoma.', 'Investigation of Prognostic Value of Claudin-5, PSMA, and Ki67 Expression in Canine Splenic Hemangiosarcoma.']"""

These experiments showed that prepared Pd(II) complex can effectively intercalate into CT-DNA and weakly bind to BSA in which the bovine serum albumin molecule was unfolded slightly.

The performance and added value of either targeted alone vs random sextant vs combined biopsy template was appraised.  Methods:   Data from 113 patients with a suspicious lesion on mpMRI and previous history of extended 10-12 core standard biopsy who subsequently had a RCT-biopsy were analyzed. These patients had at least one prior negative standard 10-12 core biopsy (n = 70) or were on active surveillance (n = 43). At least two samples were taken from each mpMRI lesion as a targeted biopsy together with the classic laterally-directed sextant biopsy.  Results:   In patients having previous negative biopsy (n = 70), the RCT biopsy detected any cancer versus clinically-significant cancer in 62.9% versus 32.9%, respectively. Targeted biopsy diagnosed more clinically-significant cancers than sextant biopsy (31.4% versus 25.7%, p < 0.01). In this cohort, the use of targeted fusion biopsy upgraded the biopsy grade group (GrGp) in 15 (21.4%) patients compared to sextant biopsy. In patients on active surveillance, the RCT biopsy identified any cancer versus clinically-significant cancer for detection rates of 74.4% versus 39.5%, respectively. Fusion targeted biopsy diagnosed more clinically-significant cancers than sextant biopsy did (37.2% versus 18.6%, p = 0.002). The use of targeted biopsy upgraded the biopsy GrGp in 12 (27.9%) patients.  Conclusion:   As a preliminary study, among men with MRI suspicious lesions and previous negative prostate biopsy or those under active surveillance, an image-targeted plus sextant biopsy platform can be associated with increased efficiency of detecting clinically-significant prostate cancer with fewer random cores.

Materials and methods:   DTI was acquired from eleven high risk, transrectal ultrasound (TRUS)-guided biopsy proven prostate cancers with perineural invasion (histological Gleason score ≥ 7) on a 3 T magnet. Twenty parameters derived from DTI were quantified in cancer and healthy regions of the prostate. In addition, fiber tract density in normal versus cancer tissues was also calculated using DTI tractography. Support vector machine with a radial basis function kernel and area under receiver operator characteristic (ROC) were used to describe and compare the diagnostic performance of combined fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) and other statistically significant DTI parameters. Spearman correlation analysis between DTI parameters and Gleason scores was conducted.  Results:   Eighteen DTI parameters yielded statistically significant differences between cancer and healthy regions (p-value < 0.05). The ROC curve of all statistically significant DTI parameters between cancer and healthy regions was higher than the area under ROC curve using FA + MD alone (95% confidence interval = 0.988, range = 0.975-1.00) vs (95% confidence interval = 0.935, range = 0.898-0.999), respectively (p-value < 0.05). Fiber tract density was also found to be higher in cancer than in healthy tissues (+38.22%, p-value = 0.010) and may be related to the increase in nerve and vascular density reported in prostate cancer.

LncRNA SAP30L-AS1 is previously identified in the plasma of prostate cancer patients. In this study, we further investigated the expression of SAP30L-AS1 in prostate cancer tissues and cell lines. Moreover, we explored the biological roles and mechanisms of action of SAP30L-AS1 in prostate cancer. The expression of SAP30L-AS1 is found to be increased in prostate cancer tissues and cell lines compared with adjacent noncancerous tissues and normal prostate epithelial cell line, respectively. Increased expression of SAP30L-AS1 is associated with greater Gleason score, advanced pathological T stage, and poor over survival of prostate cancer patients. Functional assays demonstrated that ectopic expression of SAP30L-AS1 promotes prostate cancer proliferation and inhibits prostate cancer apoptosis. SAP30L-AS1 knockdown represses prostate cancer proliferation and induces prostate cancer apoptosis. Furthermore, SAP30L-AS1 knockdown represses prostate cancer xenograft growth in vivo. Mechanistic investigation revealed that SAP30L-AS1 physically binds to the promoter of SAP30L and represses SAP30L expression. The expression of SAP30L is negatively associated with that of SAP30L-AS1 in prostate cancer tissues. Rescue assays demonstrated that overexpression of SAP30L attenuated the roles of SAP30L-AS1 in promoting prostate cancer proliferation and inhibiting prostate cancer apoptosis. In conclusion, SAP30L-AS1 is upregulated and has oncogenic roles in prostate cancer via repressing SAP30L.

Materials and Methods Ninety-four male participants (66 years ± 7 [standard deviation]) were prospectively evaluated at 3.0-T MRI for clinical suspicion of prostate cancer. Included were 101 peripheral zone prostate cancer lesions. Histopathologic confirmation at MRI transrectal US fusion biopsy was matched with normal contralateral prostate parenchyma. MRI was performed with diffusion weighting and DCE by using GRASP (temporal resolution, 2.5 seconds) or VIBE (temporal resolution, 10 seconds). Perfusion (influx forward volume transfer constant [Ktrans] and rate constant [Kep]) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) parameters were determined by tumor volume analysis. Areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve were compared for both sequences. Results Evaluated were 101 prostate cancer lesions (GRASP, 61 lesions; VIBE, 40 lesions). In a combined analysis, diffusion and perfusion parameters ADC with Ktrans or Kep acquired with GRASP had higher diagnostic performance compared with diffusion characteristics alone (area under the curve, 0.97 ± 0.02 [standard error] vs 0.93 ± 0.03; P < .006 and .021, respectively), whereas ADC with perfusion parameters acquired with VIBE had no additional benefit (area under the curve, 0.94 ± 0.03 vs 0.93 ± 0.04; P = .18and .50, respectively, for combination of ADC with Ktrans and Kep). Conclusion If used in a dual-parameter model, incorporating diffusion and perfusion characteristics, the golden-angle radial sparse parallel acquisition technique improves the diagnostic performance of multiparametric MRI examinations of the prostate.

This work details those improvements and their effect on results. One hundred eighty IMRT plans analyzed previously were collected and new gamma criteria were applied and compared to the original results. The results were used to obtain an estimate for the number of plans that would require additional dose volume histogram (DVH)-based analysis and therefore predicted workload increase. For 2 months and 133 plans, the established criteria were continued while the new criteria were applied and tracked in parallel. Because the number of marginal or failing plans far exceeded the predicted levels, a number of calculational elements were investigated: IMRT modeling parameters, calculation grid size, and couch top modeling. After improvements to these elements, the new criteria were clinically implemented and the frequency of passing, questionable, and failing plans measured for the subsequent 15 months and 674 plans. The retrospective analysis of selected IMRT QA results demonstrated that 75% of plans should pass, while 19% of IMRT QA plans would need DVH-based analysis and an additional 6% would fail. However, after applying the tighter criteria for 2 months, the distribution of plans was significantly different from prediction with questionable or failing plans reaching 47%. After investigating and improving several elements of the IMRT calculation processes, the frequency of questionable plans was reduced to 11% and that of failing plans to less than 1%. Tighter IMRT QA tolerances revealed the need to improve several elements of our plan calculations. As a consequence, the accuracy of our plans have improved, and the frequency of finding marginal or failing IMRT QA results, remains within our practical ability to respond.""","""['Cassandra Stambaugh', 'Justin Gagneur', 'Arielle Uejo', 'Edward Clouser', 'Gary Ezzell']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""J Appl Clin Med Phys""","""['A clinically relevant IMRT QA workflow: Design and validation.', 'Institutional patient-specific IMRT QA does not predict unacceptable plan delivery.', 'A method to reconstruct and apply 3D primary fluence for treatment delivery verification.', 'Utilising the Virtual Environment for Radiotherapy Training System to Support Undergraduate Teaching of IMRT, VMAT, DCAT Treatment Planning, and QA Concepts.', 'Tolerance limits and methodologies for IMRT measurement-based verification QA: Recommendations of AAPM Task Group No. 218.']"""

Night shift work increased the cancer risk in both men (OR = 1.14, 95% CI = 1.05-1.25, P = 0.003) and women (OR = 1.12, 95% CI = 1.04-1.20, P = 0.002). Subgroup analyses showed that night shift work positively increased the risk of breast (OR = 1.22, 95% CI = 1.08-1.38), prostate (OR = 1.26, 95% CI = 1.05-1.52), and digestive system (OR = 1.15, 95% CI = 1.01-1.32) cancers. For every 5 years of night shift work, the cancer risk increased by 3.2% (OR = 1.032, 95% CI = 1.013-1.051).  Conclusion:   This is the first meta-analysis identifying the positive association between night shift work and the risk of cancer and verifying that there is no sex difference in the effect of night shift work on cancer risk. Cancer risk increases with cumulative years of night shift work.""","""['Wen Liu', 'Zhonghan Zhou', 'Dahai Dong', 'Lijiang Sun', 'Guiming Zhang']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Dis Markers""","""['Comment on ""Sex Differences in the Association between Night Shift Work and the Risk of Cancers: A Meta-Analysis of 57 Articles"".', 'Night Shift Work Increases the Risks of Multiple Primary Cancers in Women: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis of 61 Articles.', 'Night-shift work duration and breast cancer risk: an updated systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Does the association of prostate cancer with night-shift work differ according to rotating vs. fixed schedule?

The impact on long-term prostate cancer (PC) outcomes is unclear. We hypothesized higher SES would associate with better long-term outcomes regardless of race.  Methods:   Among 4,787 black and white men undergoing RP from 1988 to 2015 in the SEARCH Database, poverty (primary SES measure) was estimated by linking home ZIP-code to census data. Cox models were used to test the association between SES adjusting for demographic, clinicopathological features, and race with BCR, castration-resistant PC (CRPC), metastases, PC-specific mortality (PCSM), and all-cause mortality. Interactions between race and SES were tested.  Results:   Median follow-up was 98 months (Interquartile range: 54-150 months). There were no interactions between race and SES for BCR. Black men had 10%- to 11% increased BCR risk (P < 0.06) while SES was unrelated to BCR. There were interactions between SES and race for CRPC (P = 0.002), metastasis (P = 0.014), and PCSM (P = 0.004). Lower SES was associated with decreased CRPC (P = 0.012), metastases (P = 0.004), and PCSM (P = 0.049) in black, but not white men (all P ≥ 0.22). Higher SES was associated with decreased all-cause mortality in both races.  Conclusions:   In an equal-access setting, lower SES associated with decreased CRPC, metastases, and PCSM in black but not white men. If confirmed, these findings suggest a complex relationship between race, SES, and PC with further research needed to understand why low SES in black men decreased the risk for poor PC outcomes after RP.""","""['Mary M Everist', 'Lauren E Howard', 'William J Aronson', 'Christopher J Kane', 'Christopher L Amling', 'Matthew R Cooperberg', 'Martha K Terris', 'Stephen J Freedland']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Urol Oncol""","""['Effect of race and socioeconomic status on surgical margins and biochemical outcomes in an equal-access health care setting: results from the Shared Equal Access Regional Cancer Hospital (SEARCH) database.', 'Race and risk of metastases and survival after radical prostatectomy: Results from the SEARCH database.', 'Obesity, race, and long-term prostate cancer outcomes.', 'Obesity and prostate cancer-specific mortality after radical prostatectomy: results from the Shared Equal Access Regional Cancer Hospital (SEARCH) database.', 'Neutrophil, lymphocyte and platelet counts, and risk of prostate cancer outcomes in white and black men: results from the SEARCH database.', 'Evaluation of Social Determinants of Health and Prostate Cancer Outcomes Among Black and White Patients: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.', 'Tumor Location and a Tumor Volume over 2.8 cc Predict the Prognosis for Japanese Localized Prostate Cancer.', 'Racial disparities in treatment patterns for localized prostate cancer in an equal access system: What are we missing?', 'Racial disparities in Black men with prostate cancer: A literature review.', 'Genetic Contributions to Prostate Cancer Disparities in Men of West African Descent.']"""

Herein, an ultrasensitive multiplex immunoassay was developed by combination of rolling circle amplification (RCA) and suspension bead array (SBA) technology. Based on a conventional sandwich-type immunoreaction on beads, the detection antibodies were conjugated with DNA primers, so RCA could be implemented to generate long-stranded DNA with abundant repeated sequences allowing for hybridization with fluorochrome-labeled oligonucleotide probes. Thus the fluorescence signal of immunocomplexes on the encoded beads can be greatly enhanced. Using the as-developed immuno-RCA suspension bead array (iRCA-SBA), simultaneous analysis of multiple tumor markers was achieved with the limits of detection of 3.1 pg/mL (∼0.1 pM) for prostate specific antigen (PSA), 9.1 pg/mL (∼50 fM) for carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), and 0.66 pg/mL (∼9 fM) for α-fetoprotein (AFP), which are two to three orders of magnitude lower than those obtained by the conventional SBA method. The dynamic range were 4.5, 4.7, and 5.5 orders of magnitude for PSA, CEA, and AFP, respectively. Tests on clinical serum samples demonstrate that the tumor marker concentrations measured by the newly developed iRCA-SBA assay agreed well with those obtained by the conventional SBA method. These results indicate that the iRCA-SBA assay significantly increased the detection sensitivity and dynamic range without sacrificing the reliability and accuracy of conventional SBA. Upon the integration with iRCA, SBA could find more applications in the detection of low abundance protein biomarkers for early diagnosis of cancer and other diseases.""","""['Min Gao', 'Hong Lian', 'Longjiao Yu', 'Manfei Gong', 'Ling Ma', 'Yingxing Zhou', 'Muxin Yu', 'Xiaomei Yan']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Anal Chim Acta""","""['Vertical flow assays based on core-shell SERS nanotags for multiplex prostate cancer biomarker detection.', 'Multiplex immunodetection of tumor markers with a suspension array built upon core-shell structured functional fluorescence-encoded microspheres.', 'A vertical flow microarray chip based on SERS nanotags for rapid and ultrasensitive quantification of α-fetoprotein\xa0and carcinoembryonic antigen.', 'Lighting Up Nucleic Acid Modifications in Single Cells with DNA-Encoded Amplification.', 'Glycosylation-Based Serum Biomarkers for Cancer Diagnostics and Prognostics.', ""Determination of plasma β-amyloids by rolling circle amplification chemiluminescent immunoassay for noninvasive diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease."", 'Critical Review: digital resolution biomolecular sensing for diagnostics and life science research.']"""

Such innovation provides a great opportunity to decode phenotypic consequences of genetic variation via the construction of predictive gene regulatory network models. However, there still lacks a computational method to systematically integrate chromatin accessibility information with gene expression data to recover complicated regulatory relationships between genes in a tissue-specific manner.  Results:   We propose a Markov random field (MRF) model for constructing tissue-specific transcriptional regulatory networks via integrative analysis of DNase-seq and RNA-seq data. Our method, named CSNets (cell-line specific regulatory networks), first infers regulatory networks for individual cell lines using chromatin accessibility information, and then fine-tunes these networks using the MRF based on pairwise similarity between cell lines derived from gene expression data. Using this method, we constructed regulatory networks specific to 110 human cell lines and 13 major tissues with the use of ENCODE data. We demonstrated the high quality of these networks via comprehensive statistical analysis based on ChIP-seq profiles, functional annotations, taxonomic analysis, and literature surveys. We further applied these networks to analyze GWAS data of Crohn's disease and prostate cancer. Results were either consistent with the literature or provided biological insights into regulatory mechanisms of these two complex diseases. The website of CSNets is freely available at http://bioinfo.au.tsinghua.edu.cn/jianglab/CSNETS/ .  Conclusions:   CSNets demonstrated the power of joint analysis on epigenomic and transcriptomic data towards the accurate construction of gene regulatory network.

Methods and results:   Forty-six isolates were obtained and identified by DNA barcoding. They belonged to genera Nemania, Daldinia, Peziza and Coniochaeta. Six strains belonging to the most represented species were selected and tested for their antiproliferative and antibiofilm activities. Extracts were analysed by reversed-phase HPLC. Activities against fungal and bacterial biofilm were evaluated using tetrazolium salt (XTT) assay and crystal violet assay respectively. Antiproliferative responses of extracts were determined by the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. Apoptosis induction by two extracts was observed in two cell lines (HT-29 and PC-3) via morphological changes, pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic proteins analysis (Western blotting) and DNA fragmentation. Four extracts displayed activities against Candida albicans biofilm with IC50 values ranging from 25 to 200 μg ml-1 . All extracts were inactive against Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms. The most active isolates against human colorectal (HT-29 and HCT116) and prostate (PC-3 and DU145) cancer cell lines were Nemania serpens (NL08) and Nemania aenea var. aureolatum (NL38) with IC50 values ranging from 13 to 39 μg ml-1 . These extracts induced an apoptotic process through activation of caspases 8 and 3, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage and DNA fragmentation.  Conclusions:   Selected crude fungal extracts have antiproliferative and antibiofilm activities. Data suggest that this antipoliferative effect is due to apoptosis process.

Demonstrating causality has proven challenging and one common limitation of MR studies is insufficient power.  Methods:   We aimed to determine whether circulating concentrations of vitamin D are causally associated with the risk of breast and prostate cancer, by using summary-level data from the largest ever genome-wide association studies conducted on vitamin D (N = 73 699), breast cancer (Ncase = 122 977) and prostate cancer (Ncase = 79 148). We constructed a stronger instrument using six common genetic variants (compared with the previous four variants) and applied several two-sample MR methods.  Results:   We found no evidence to support a causal association between 25(OH)D and risk of breast cancer [OR per 25 nmol/L increase, 1.02 (95% confidence interval: 0.97-1.08), P = 0.47], oestrogen receptor (ER)+ [1.00 (0.94-1.07), P = 0.99] or ER- [1.02 (0.90-1.16), P = 0.75] subsets, prostate cancer [1.00 (0.93-1.07), P = 0.99] or the advanced subtype [1.02 (0.90-1.16), P = 0.72] using the inverse-variance-weighted method. Sensitivity analyses did not reveal any sign of directional pleiotropy.  Conclusions:   Despite its almost five-fold augmented sample size and substantially improved statistical power, our MR analysis does not support a causal effect of circulating 25(OH)D concentrations on breast- or prostate-cancer risk.

Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a new emerging and promising strategy for the treatment of prostate cancer. PDT uses a combination of light and a photosensitizer (PS) to kill cancer cells. However, most photosensitizers (PS) accumulate in normal tissues, in particular the skin and eyes, and can be activated by sunlight, causing severe side effects such as prolonged skin photosensitivity that have limited the clinical application of PDT. Herein, a novel strategy is presented to overcome these limitations using Indocyanine green (ICG) as an activatable PDT agent. We developed a human serum albumin (HSA)-based nanoplatform loaded with Chlorin e6 (Ce6) and ICG. In vitro and in vivo studies showed that ICG effectively turned ""OFF"" the phototoxicity of Ce6, and the degradation of ICG by laser irradiation at 808 nm turned ""ON"" the phototoxicity of Ce6. In addition, ICG produced heat upon NIR irradiation to kill cancer cells, which could be used as a photothermal therapy (PTT).

The patients underwent six MRI scans, from treatment planning to near end of treatment. The CTV movements were analyzed with deformable registration technique with the CTV divided into sections. The validity of the deformable registration was assessed by comparing the results for individual lymph nodes that were possible to identify in all scans.  Results:   Using repetitive MRI, measurements showed that areas inside the CTV (lymph nodes) in some extreme cases were as mobile as the prostate and not fixed to the bones. The lymph node volumes closest to the prostate did not tend to follow the prostate motion. The more cranial lymph node volumes moved less, but still independently, and they were not necessarily fixed to the pelvic bones. In 95% of the cases, the lymph node motion in the R-L direction was 2-4 mm, in the A-P direction 2-7 mm, and in the C-C direction 2-5 mm depending on the CTV section.

Mechanistically, Nanog, but not other pluripotency-determining factors including Oct4, Sox2, and Klf4, specifically interacts with SPOP via a conservative degron motif. Importantly, cancer-derived mutations in SPOP or at the Nanog-degron (S68Y) disrupt SPOP-mediated destruction of Nanog, leading to elevated cancer stem cell traits and PrCa progression. Notably, we identify the Pin1 oncoprotein as an upstream Nanog regulator that impairs its recognition by SPOP and thereby stabilizes Nanog.

However, physical activity affords health benefits to cancer patients, including those with CaP. Glutathione S-Transferases enzymes have been linked to CaP because of their role in the detoxification of a wide variety of potential carcinogens, steroid hormones and xenobiotics. Among the different glutathione S-transferases isoforms, null genotype for GSTM1 has been associated with an increased risk of CaP, although data are controversial. As the relationship between copy number variation and gene expression of GSTM1 in CaP remains unexplored, this study analyzed GSTM1 gene expression and/or dosage effect on CaP risk and aggressiveness. The potential protective role of physical activity was also explored.  Methods:   Three hundred and seventeen patients (159 non-CaP and 158 CaP) were recruited from the Service of Urology (Hospital Virgen de las Nieves, Granada, Spain) over the period 2012 to 2014 and were followed-up until January 2018 to ensure a correct classification of control and patients. Individuals were classified in each group based on histological analysis of tissue biopsy, along with data on PSA level, Gleason score and T stage in patients with biopsies positive for CaP. Individuals with a negative biopsy were considered as controls. All controls underwent a systematic 20-core ultrasound guided biopsy in order to limit the false negative rate. Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood to determine the exact copy numbers of GSTM1, and RNA was extracted from prostate tissue samples to determine GSTM1 gene expression. Both analyses were performed using the qPCR method. A questionnaire was administered to all patients to assess environmental exposures, lifestyle, and physical activity. The association of GSTM1 copy number variation and expression with the rest of variables was assessed by chi-square test and the Mann-Whitney test. Multiple logistic regression was used to assess which factors were associated with the risk of CaP.  Results:   The presence of 1 or 2 copies of the GSTM1 gene was not less prevalent in CaP compared to non-CaP patients; however, a significant decreased GSTM1 gene expression was observed in CaP tissue relative to non-CaP tissue (P = 0.003). CaP patients with environmental exposure to dust and smoke, and smoking habit had a significantly decreased GSTM1 gene expression (and near-significantly decreased for living in urban areas) as compared to non-CaP patients with the same exposures. In addition, physical activity was significantly associated with a lower risk of CaP (P = 0.006) and with increased GSTM1 gene expression (P = 0.002).  Conclusions:   A reduced GSTM1 gene expression in prostate tissue was observed in CaP patients with some environmental chemical exposures. Intriguingly, physical activity might play a protective role against CaP development, possibly as a result of increasing GSTM1 gene expression in prostate tissue. However, this observation warrants further confirmation.""","""['Antonio Gómez-Martín', 'Luis J Martinez-Gonzalez', 'Ignacio Puche-Sanz', 'Jose M Cozar', 'Jose A Lorente', 'Antonio F Hernández', 'Maria J Alvarez-Cubero']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Urol Oncol""","""['Copy number variation in glutathione-S-transferase T1 and M1 predicts incidence and 5-year survival from prostate and bladder cancer, and incidence of corpus uteri cancer in the general population.', 'Polymorphism of GSTM1 and GSTT1 genes in prostate cancer: a study from North India.', 'How many copies of GSTM1 and GSTT1 are associated with head and neck cancer risk?', 'Biomarkers of gentotoxic risk and metabolic polymorphism.', 'Glutathione S-transferase mu 1 (GSTM1): susceptibility gene of breast cancer.', 'Association of Androgen-Receptor Gene Mutations with the Copy Number of Androgen-Receptor Silk Protein A Complex and Glutathione-S-Transferases T1 and M1 in Prostate Cancer Patients.', 'GSTT1, an increased risk factor for prostate cancer in patients with metabolic syndrome.', 'The NRF2, Thioredoxin, and Glutathione System in Tumorigenesis and Anticancer Therapies.']"""

Castrated athymic nude mice receiving zibotentan for a preclinical xenograft efficacy study experienced weight loss, gastrointestinal bloat, and the presence of an audible respiratory click. Human side effects have been reported in the nasal cavity, so we hypothesized that the nasal cavity is a target for toxicity in mice receiving zibotentan. Lesions in the nasal cavity predominantly targeted olfactory epithelium in treated mice and were more pronounced in castrated animals. Minimal lesions were present in vehicle control animals, which suggested possible gavage-related reflux injury. The incidence, distribution, and morphology of lesions suggested direct exposure to the nasal mucosa and a possible systemic effect targeting the olfactory epithelium, driven by a type 2 immune response, with group 2 innate lymphoid cell involvement. Severe nasal lesions may have resulted in recurrent upper airway obstruction, leading to aerophagia and associated clinical morbidity.

Elevated levels of β-arrestin 2 (β-arr 2) mRNA were also found in advanced stages of breast cancer compared to early stages. In addition, β2-arrestin was also linked to a suppressive effect on tumor growth in other types of cancers such as prostate or non-small cell lung cancer. In this study, we analyzed the effect of β-arr 1 overexpression on the cytotoxic effect of Temozolomide (TMZ) in two malignant glioma (MG) cell lines: U-343MGa and Cl2:6. For this purpose, the cells were transected with β-arr 1 and then treated with different concentrations of TMZ for 24, 48 and 72 hours. At the end of the treatment, the cell viability was analyzed by Prestoblue viability assay.

Methods and materials:   A total of 136 patients were enrolled in a phase 1 dose-escalation study to determine the tolerance of escalating radiation dose levels of SBRT for the treatment of localized prostate cancer. The initial dose level was 32.5 Gy in 5 fractions, and doses were then sequentially escalated to 35 Gy, 37.5 Gy, and 40 Gy. Eligibility criteria included only patients with low and intermediate risk, and the maximum prostate volume was 60 cm3. Patients treated with neoadjuvant androgen deprivation were excluded. The median follow-up in survivors for the 4 dose levels was 5.9, 5.4, 4.1, and 3.5 years, respectively.  Results:   The incidence of acute grade 2 rectal toxicities for dose levels 1 to 4 were 0%, 2.9%, 2.8%, and 11.4% respectively. No grade 3 or 4 acute rectal toxicities were observed. The incidence of acute grade 2 urinary toxicities for dose levels 1 to 4 were 16.7%, 22.9%, 8.3%, and 17.1%, respectively. No grade 3 or 4 acute urinary toxicities were observed. No grade 2 or higher rectal toxicities were observed. The incidence of late grade 2 urinary toxicities for dose levels 1 to 4 was 23.3%, 25.7%, 27.8%, and 31.4%, respectively. Only 1 late grade 3 urinary toxicity (urethral stricture) developed in the 40-Gy dose arm; the stricture was corrected with transurethral resection. No grade 4 late urinary toxicity was observed. The 5-year cumulative incidence of prostate-specific antigen failure for dose levels 1 to 4 was 15%, 6%, 0%, and 0%. The incidence of a 2-year positive posttreatment biopsy was 47.6%, 19.2%, 16.7%, and 7.7%, respectively for the 4 dose arms (P = .013).

In the case of anthracyclines, many resistance mechanisms have been described. One of them assumes the role of carbonyl reductase 1 (CBR1), a cytosolic enzyme that is responsible for the biotransformation process of anthracyclines to less active, undesirable metabolites. Therefore, CBR1 inhibitors are considered for use as a chemosensitizing agents. In the present study, piperlongumine (PL), a Piper longum L. alkaloid that has previously been described as a CBR1 inhibitor, was investigated for its chemosensitizing properties in co-treatment with doxorubicin (DOX). The biotransformation process of DOX in the presence of PL was tracked using human cytosol fraction and LC-MS, then a molecular modeling study was conducted to predict the interaction of PL with the active site of the CBR1. The biological interaction between DOX and PL was investigated using DU-145 prostate cancer cells. Cytotoxic and antiproliferative properties of DOX and PL were examined, and the type and potency of interaction was quantified by Combination Index. The mechanism of the cell death induced by the agents was investigated by flow cytometry and the anti-invasive properties of the drugs were determined by monitoring the movement of individual cells. PL showed dose-dependent inhibition of DOX metabolism in cytosol, which resulted in less doxorubicinol (DOXol) metabolite being formed. The possible mechanism of CBR1 inhibition was explained through molecular modeling studies by prediction of PL's binding mode in the active site of the enzyme's crystal structure-based model. DOX and PL showed a synergistic antiproliferative and proapoptotic effect on cancer cells. Significant anti-invasive properties of the combination of DOX and PL were found, but when the drugs were used separately they did not alter the cancer cells' motility. Cell motility inhibition was accompanied by significant changes in cytoskeleton architecture. DOX and PL used in co-treatment showed significant synergistic anticancer properties. Inhibition of DOX metabolism by PL was found to be a mechanism that was likely to be responsible for the observed interaction.""","""['Kamil Piska', 'Paulina Koczurkiewicz', 'Dawid Wnuk', 'Elżbieta Karnas', 'Adam Bucki', 'Katarzyna Wójcik-Pszczoła', 'Marek Jamrozik', 'Marta Michalik', 'Marcin Kołaczkowski', 'Elżbieta Pękala']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Chem Biol Interact""","""['Cinnamic acid derivatives as chemosensitising agents against DOX-treated lung cancer cells - Involvement of carbonyl reductase 1.', 'Inhibition of Carbonyl Reductase 1 Safely Improves the Efficacy of Doxorubicin in Breast Cancer Treatment.', 'Piperlongumine Induces Apoptosis and Synergizes with Doxorubicin by Inhibiting the JAK2-STAT3 Pathway in Triple-Negative Breast Cancer.', 'Metabolic carbonyl reduction of anthracyclines - role in cardiotoxicity and cancer resistance.

Recently, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) has been shown to play a role in CaP growth, and clinical data showed that high serum concentration of FSH in chemically castrated CaP patients was associated with a shorter time of progression to castration-resistant CaP. In this study, we sought to investigate if FSH could have direct effects on CaP cells, possibly through the androgen receptor and androgen receptor regulated genes, such as prostate-specific antigen (PSA).  Materials and methods:   The human CaP cell lines PC-3, LNCaP and C4-2, and nonmalignant PNT1A cells, were utilized to investigate the effects of FSH. qPCR, Western blotting analysis, and 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymetoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H tetrazolium assays were performed in order to analyze the FSH effects.  Results:   The FSH receptor was present in all cell lines except PNT1A. FSH significantly increased PSA mRNA (P < 0.01) and protein (P < 0.03) levels in C4-2 cells in a dose-dependent manner. In LNCaP cells, FSH also increased PSA protein level, although to a lesser extent than in C4-2 cells, and the expression was reduced by the antiandrogen enzalutamide. In PC-3 cells, FSH was shown to increase their proliferation (P < 0.03) and β-catenin expression.

Our objective was to determine the practice patterns and predictors of PLN-RT in a national cohort.  Materials and methods:   The National Cancer Data Base (2005-2015) was leveraged to obtain men diagnosed with nonmetastatic CaP treated with external beam radiotherapy (n = 197,378). Multivariable logistic regressions were used to assess temporal trends and factors associated with PLN-RT.  Results:   PLN-RT occurred in 37% of patients overall, which increased to 41% by 2015. When stratified by risk group, there was no significant difference in PLN-RT over time in low, favorable intermediate, unfavorable intermediate, or high-risk CaP. PLN-RT increased for men with very high-risk disease (51%-60%; odds ratio per year 1.34, 95% confidence inrerval 1.06-1.70, P = 0.013). Increased odds of PLN-RT was associated with higher risk disease, addition of hormone therapy, treatment at community hospitals, and shorter patient travel distance to treatment facilities. Surprisingly, 26% and 34% of low and favorable intermediate risk CaP received PLN-RT, respectively. Predictors of PLN-RT among these patients included treatment at a community practice and use of brachytherapy or hormone therapy.  Conclusions:   PLN-RT occurred in about one-third of men receiving external beam radiotherapy and increased over time, mostly in men with very high-risk CaP for unclear reasons.

Patients and methods:   Mate pair sequencing of amplified DNA from pure populations of Gleason patterns in 154 frozen specimens from 126 patients obtained between August 14, 2001, and July 15, 2011, was used to detect CRs including abnormal junctions and copy number variations.

Results:   The number of abnormal junctions did not distinguish LRP from IHRP. Loci corresponding to genes implicated in PCa were more frequently altered in IHRP.

The marketed drug product (Zytiga®) exhibits very low bioavailability in the fasted state and a substantial positive food effect. We recently developed a nano-amorphous formulation of this drug which exhibited higher apparent solubility and dissolution rate, and significantly improved absorption and bioavailability in the fasted state in beagle dogs and in a phase I clinical study. One surprising finding, however, was the very rapid absorption observed both in dogs and in humans with median tmax values in the 0.5-0.75 h range. This could not be explained by the improved dissolution characteristics alone. A recent study showed that following the administration of Zytiga® abiraterone acetate is converted to abiraterone in the intestinal lumen yielding supersaturated abiraterone concentrations, which is believed to be the driving force of the absorption process. In our work we found that the enzymatic hydrolysis of abiraterone acetate profoundly changes the pharmacokinetics of the nano-amorphous formulation in the fasted state and it is the most probable reason for the unexpectedly high absorption rate. Our primary candidate for the isoenzyme involved is pancreatic cholesterol esterase. Furthermore, we identified orlistat as a potent inhibitor of cholesterol esterase and found it to be an ideal compound for the study of the enzymatic process in vivo. The observed inhibition could result in a clinically significant modification of abiraterone pharmacokinetics, which might make a drug interaction warning necessary for abiraterone acetate containing drugs. The mathematical and experimental tools presented in this work might be suitable for the study of the contribution of other intestinal enzymatic processes to the absorption process of other prodrugs as well.""","""['Orsolya Basa-Dénes', 'Tamás Solymosi', 'Zsolt Ötvös', 'Réka Angi', 'Andrea Ujhelyi', 'Tamás Jordán', 'Gábor Heltovics', 'Hristos Glavinas']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Eur J Pharm Sci""","""['Development of an abiraterone acetate formulation with improved oral bioavailability guided by absorption modeling based on in vitro dissolution and permeability measurements.', 'Novel formulation of abiraterone acetate might allow significant dose reduction and eliminates substantial positive food effect.', 'Bioavailability Enhancement and Food Effect Elimination of Abiraterone Acetate by Encapsulation in Surfactant-Enriched Oil Marbles.', 'Oral formulation strategies to improve the bioavailability and mitigate the food effect of abiraterone acetate.', 'Abiraterone Acetate: A Review in Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostrate Cancer.', 'Systematic Development of Solid Lipid Nanoparticles of Abiraterone Acetate with Improved Oral Bioavailability and Anticancer Activity for Prostate Carcinoma Treatment.', 'Dose Finding and Food Effect Studies of a Novel Abiraterone Acetate Formulation for Oral Suspension in Comparison to a Reference Formulation in Healthy Male Subjects.', 'Supersaturated-Silica Lipid Hybrids Improve in Vitro Solubilization of Abiraterone Acetate.']"""

The associations between aspirin use and freedom from biochemical failure (FFBF), overall survival (OS) and relative factors were evaluated.  Results:   Multivariate analysis showed that aspirin therapy, T classification, Gleason score (GS), and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) were associated with biochemical failure. The aspirin group had a significantly better FFBF rate (91.1%) at 5 years than the control group (82.3%, p=0.000). Among patients with high-risk disease, the FFBF rate for patients in the aspirin group was 79.1% at 5 years compared to 52.2% in the control group (p=0.000).

Community oncology practices follow 85% of adult cancer survivors but report more difficulty in providing SCPs compared to academic centers. Our objective was to evaluate the impact of delivering SCPs in a community oncology practice by examining awareness of SCP receipt as well as how provision affects survivors' perception of care quality and of their condition. Survivors who accepted a SCP as standard of care were recruited from a community oncology practice in the Midwest and completed surveys prior to SCP provision (baseline) and 4 weeks later (follow-up). Within-survivor changes in knowledge of SCP receipt, satisfaction and perceived care coordination were assessed. Thirty cancer survivors (breast, colon, and prostate) completed the baseline survey, while 24 completed the follow-up survey (80% response rate). Participants reported receiving SCPs and treatment summaries more frequently at follow-up after receiving a SCP. At follow-up, there was a significant increase in survivor activation and involvement in care along with satisfaction of knowledge of care. Communication about and during SCP provision may need to be clearer: 34% of survivors could not correctly identify SCP receipt in this study. This may place these survivors at a disadvantage, if this leads to less awareness of important information regarding follow-up surveillance and management.

When PSA is moderately increased (e.g., 4-10 ng/ml), it is difficult to differentiate benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) from cancer. The diagnostic test (i.e., prostate biopsy) is invasive, adding pain and economic burden to the patient. Urine samples are more convenient, non-invasive and readily available than blood. We sought to determine whether ferritin might be the potential urinary biomarker in prostate cancer diagnosis. Using two-dimensional electrophoresis (2DE) followed by mass spectrometry (MS), differentially expressed urinary proteins among patients with PCa, BPH and normal controls were obtained. The ferritin heavy chain (FTH) gene, ferritin light chain (FTL) gene and protein expression of BPH-1 cells and PC-3 cells were analyzed by real-time quantitative PCR and Western blotting, respectively. Stable FTH or FTL silenced cell lines were generated by small hairpin(sh) RNA lentiviral transfection. The function of the cell lines was evaluated by the colony formation assay, transwell assay, and flow cytometry. Compared with BPH and normal controls, 15 overexpressed proteins, including FTH and FTL, were identified in the urine of the PCa group. FTH and FTL were also highly expressed in PC-3 cell lines compared with BPH-1 cells. FTH-silenced cells showed reduced cell proliferation, migration and increased cell apoptosis. FTL-silenced cells showed increased proliferation and migration abilities. There are differences in urinary proteins among patients with PCa, BPH and normal controls.

Patients and methods:   Twenty-five patients with biochemical prostate cancer recurrence after primary prostatectomy underwent 68 Ga-PSMA ligand PET/CT in addition to conventional imaging techniques such as CT and/or MR imaging for restaging. All patients were diagnosed with at least one lymph node metastasis. TVs were manually delineated in two different ways: (a) based on conventional imaging (CT/MRI) and (b) based on conventional imaging (CT/MRI) plus 68 Ga-PSMA ligand PET/CT. The size of TVs, overlap rates, and subjective assessment of the difficulty of TV delineation reported by the radiation oncologist (easy/moderate/difficult) were compared.  Results:   With the additional information from PSMA ligand PET, 47 lymph node metastases were identified and included in the gross tumor volume (GTV). The median clinical target volume (CTV) of non-PET-based TV delineation was statistically larger than the CTV based on PET imaging (134.8 ml [range 6.9-565.2] versus 44.9 ml [range 4.9-481.3; p = 0.001]). The CTV based on CT/MRI enclosed only 81.3% (39/48) of PET-positive lymph nodes. The CT/MRI-based CTV did not enclose all PET-positive lymph nodes in 24% (6/25) of patients. In 12% (3/25) of patients, all PET-positive lymph nodes were outside of the CT/MRI-based CTV. The median overlap rates (TVPET/TVCT/MRI × 100) were 45.7% (range 0-96.9) for the GTV and 71.7% (range 9.8-98.2) for the CTV. The assessment of difficulty of contouring revealed that contouring with the additional imaging information of the PET was categorized as easy/moderate in 92% (23/25) and as difficult in 8% (2/25) of the cases, whereas contouring based on CT/MRI without PET was categorized as difficult in 56% (14/25) and as easy/moderate in 44% of the cases (11/25; p = 0.003).  Conclusion: 68 Ga-PSMA ligand PET/CT is superior to conventional cross-sectional imaging for the delineation of lymph node metastases from prostate cancer.

We recently showed that NE expression and activity from infiltrating myeloid cells was high in human prostate cancer xenografts and mouse Pten-null prostate tumors. We further demonstrated that NE directly stimulated human prostate cancer cells to proliferate, migrate, and invade, and inhibition of NE in vivo attenuated xenograft growth. Interestingly, reduced expression of SERPINB1, an endogenous NE inhibitor, also correlates with diminished survival in some cancers. Therefore, we sought to characterize the role of SERPINB1 in prostate cancer. We find that SERPINB1 expression is reduced in human metastatic and locally advanced disease and predicts poor outcome. SERPINB1 is also reduced in Pten-null mouse prostate tumors compared with wild-type prostates, and treatment with sivelestat (SERPINB1 pharmacomimetic) attenuates tumor growth. Knockdown of highly expressed SERPINB1 in nonmalignant prostatic epithelial cells (RWPE-1) increases proliferation, decreases apoptosis, and stimulates expression of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition markers. In contrast, stable SERPINB1 expression in normally low-expressing prostate cancer cells (C4-2) reduces xenograft growth in vivo. Finally, EZH2-mediated histone (H3K27me3) methylation and DNA methyltransferase-mediated DNA methylation suppress SERPINB1 expression in prostate cancer cells. Analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas and pyrosequencing demonstrate hypermethylation of the SERPINB1 promoter in prostate cancer compared with normal tissue, and the extent of promoter methylation negatively correlates with SERPINB1 mRNA expression.

The extracellular capacitive currents present two standard patterns: an asynchronous sporadic pattern and a synchronous quasi-periodic biphasic spike pattern. An amplitude of ±150 pA, a width between 50⁻300 ms and an inter-spike interval around 0.5 Hz characterize the quasi-periodic spikes. Our experiments using treatment of cells with Gd³⁺, known as an inhibitor for the Ca²⁺ exchanges, suggest that the quasi-periodic signals originate from Ca²⁺ channels. After adding the Gd³⁺ to a population of living PC-3 cells, their electrical activity considerably decreased; once the culture was washed, thus eliminating the Gd³⁺ containing medium and addition of fresh cellular growth medium, the PC-3 cells recovered their normal electrical activity. Cellular viability plots have been carried out, demonstrating that the PC-3 cells remain viable after the use of Gd³⁺, on the timescale of this experiment. Hence, this experimental work suggests that Ca²⁺ is significantly affecting the electrophysiological communication pattern among PC-3 cell populations. Our measuring platform opens up new avenues for real time and highly sensitive investigations of prostate cancer signalling pathways.""","""['Miguel Cabello', 'Haobo Ge', 'Carmen Aracil', 'Despina Moschou', 'Pedro Estrela', 'Jose Manuel Quero', 'Sofia I Pascu', 'Paulo R F Rocha']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Sensors (Basel)""","""['Ultrasensitive System for Electrophysiology of Cancer Cell Populations: A Review.', 'Extracellular Electrophysiological Measurements of Cooperative Signals in Astrocytes Populations.', 'In Vivo Observations of Rapid Scattered Light Changes Associated with Neurophysiological Activity.', 'Optimizing Nanoelectrode Arrays for Scalable Intracellular Electrophysiology.', 'Zoledronic acid in combination with serine/threonine phosphatase inhibitors induces enhanced cytotoxicity and apoptosis in hormone-refractory prostate cancer cell lines by decreasing the activities of PP1 and PP2A.', 'Blood pressure, calcium channel blockers, and the risk of prostate cancer: a Mendelian randomization study.', 'Voltage imaging reveals the dynamic electrical signatures of human breast cancer cells.', 'SIRT5 Directly Inhibits the PI3K/AKT Pathway in Prostate Cancer Cell Lines.', 'Ultrasensitive System for Electrophysiology of Cancer Cell Populations: A Review.', 'Microfluidics Integration into Low-Noise Multi-Electrode Arrays.']"""

A population-based study from Ontario Canada""","""Background:   The overuse of medical tests leads to higher costs, wasting of resources, and the potential for overdiagnosis of disease. This study was designed to determine whether the patients of family doctors who order more routine medical tests are diagnosed with more cancers.  Method:   A retrospective population-based cross-sectional study using administrative health care data in Ontario Canada. We investigated the ordering of 23 routine laboratories and imaging tests 2008-20012 by 6849 Ontario family physicians on their 4.9 million rostered adult patients. We compared physicians' test utilization and calculated case-mix adjusted observed to expected (O:E) utilization ratios to categorize physicians as Typical, Higher or Lower testers. Age-sex standardized rates (cases/10 000 patient years) and Rate Ratios were determined for cancers of the thyroid, prostate, breast, lymphoma, kidney, melanoma, uterus, ovary, lung, esophagus, and pancreas for each tester group.  Results:   There was wide variation in the use of the 23 tests by Ontario physicians. 26% and 24% of physicians were deemed Higher Testers for laboratory and imaging tests, while 41% and 38% were Typical Testers. The patients of higher test users were diagnosed with more cancers of thyroid (laboratory [RR 1.61, 95% CI 1.39-1.87] and imaging [RR 2.08, 95% CI 0.88-2.30]) and prostate (laboratory [RR 1.10, 95% CI 1.03-1.18] and imaging [RR 1.05, 95% CI 1.00-1.10]).  Conclusion:   There is a wide variation in the ordering of routine and common medical tests among Ontario family doctors.

However, its role in metastatic PCa (mPCa) remains unknown.  Objectives:   We aim to investigate the clinical significance of PNI in patients with mPCa.  Materials and methods:   Data of 515 mPCa patients between 2012 and 2018 were retrospectively studied. PNI and its intensity were identified by prostate biopsy. The prognostic value of PNI was evaluated by Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox proportional-hazards model.  Results:   Perineural invasion was detected in 170/515 (33.0%) cases. Among them 73/170 (42.9%) and 97/170 (57.1%) harbored unifocal PNI (uni-PNI) and multifocal PNI (multi-PNI), respectively. Compared to patients without PNI, those with PNI had statistically shorter castration-resistant PCa-free survival (CFS) and numerically shorter overall survival (OS) (mCFS: 15.4- vs. 18.5-Mo, p = 0.015; mOS: 63.8- vs. 71.4-Mo, p = 0.108). Patients harboring multi-PNI were associated with poorer clinical outcomes than those with uni-PNI (mCFS: 12.4- vs. 18.0-Mo, p = 0.040; mOS: 39.7-Mo vs. NR, p = 0.018) or those without PNI (mCFS: 12.4- vs. 18.5-Mo, p = 0.002; mOS: 39.7- vs. 71.4-Mo, p = 0.002). Totally, neither uni-PNI nor multi-PNI was an independent risk factor impacting survival outcomes in multivariate analyses. While remarkably, for patients with favorable/intermediate-risk mPCa, multi-PNI was an independent adverse prognosticator for both CFS and OS (CFS: HR: 1.705, 95% CI: 1.029-2.825, p = 0.038; OS: HR: 3.294, 95% CI: 1.464-7.413, p = 0.004).  Discussion and conclusion:   This study filled the blank of the clinical significance of PNI in mPCa. We found that multi-PNI could distinguish men with relatively poor prognosis from patients initially regarded as with favorable survival outcomes by other prognosticators, and thus, avoid disease underestimation in this group of patients. Our finding would help physicians have a deeper understanding of the heterogeneity of mPCa and make better individualized therapeutic strategy.""","""['J Zhao', 'J Chen', 'M Zhang', 'X Tang', 'G Sun', 'S Zhu', 'J Liu', 'H Zhang', 'X Zhang', 'X Yin', 'P Zhao', 'X Zhu', 'Y Ni', 'J Dai', 'P Shen', 'N Chen', 'H Zeng']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Andrology""","""['The subgroup analysis of the prognostic value of the intraductal carcinoma of the prostate in patients with metastatic prostate cancer.', 'Clinical and oncologic findings of extraprostatic extension on needle biopsy in de novo metastatic prostate cancer.', 'Does ductal adenocarcinoma of the prostate (DA) have any prognostic impact on patients with de novo metastatic prostate cancer?', 'Perineural invasion as a prognostic factor for cervical cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Perineural Invasion is a Strong Prognostic Factor in Colorectal Cancer: A Systematic Review.', 'The Role of Perineural Invasion in Prostate Cancer and Its Prognostic Significance.', 'Antibody-Drug Conjugates in Uro-Oncology.', 'Impact of positive surgical margin location and perineural invasion on biochemical recurrence in patients undergoing radical prostatectomy.', 'Schwann Cell-Derived CCL2 Promotes the Perineural Invasion of Cervical Cancer.']"""

Based on the standardized national classifications, we grouped patients' longest-held occupational class (blue-collar, service, professional, manager), cross-classified by industrial cluster (blue-collar, service, white-collar). Using blue-collar workers in blue-collar industries as the referent group, odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated by conditional logistic regression with multiple imputation, matched for age, admission date, and admitting hospital.

CT structures contoured included the clinical target volume (CTV), seminal vesicles, rectum, colon, bowel bag, bladder and peri-rectal space (PRS). MR contours included CTV, trigone, membranous urethra, penile bulb, neurovascular bundle and multiple pelvic floor muscles.

Long noncoding RNAs (LncRNAs) are reported to be dysregulated in a variety of cancers, including PC. This study aimed to explore the role of LncRNA GHET1 in the pathogenesis of PC. RT-qPCR was carried out to examine the relative expression level of GHET1 in PC patients. In vitro, GHET1 siRNA (si-GHET1) was used to investigate the biological role of GHET1 in PC cell lines. Cell proliferation was detected by CCK-8 and colony formation assay, while cell cycle and cell apoptosis were analyzed using flow cytometry. Moreover, western blot was carried out to measure the protein expression levels of KLF2 and HIF-1α/Notch-1 signal pathway. We found that GHET1 showed higher expression in PC tissues and had a negative correlation with KLF2 expression. Knockdown of GHET1 significantly suppressed the cell proliferation, induced cell cycle arrest at G0/G1 phase and promoted cell apoptosis. Additionally, si-GHET1 transfection induced KLF2 upregulation and HIF-1α/Notch-1 signal pathway suppression, which could be rescued by si-KLF2 transfection. These results suggest the key role of GHET1 in PC progression.

However, its clinical significance and underlying molecular mechanisms in prostate cancer (PCa) remain unknown.  Methods:   The clinical significance of CUL4B in PCa was characterized by in silico method. RT-qPCR and Western blot were used to study the transcript and protein expression levels of CUL4B and C-MYC. Bioinformatics tools, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and luciferase reporter assay were utilized to identify and characterize the microRNAs (miRNAs) regulated by CUL4B. The biological function of CUL4B and miR-33b-5p was evaluated by MTS, transwell, and wound healing assays, accordingly.  Results:   CUL4B is significantly overexpressed in PCa tissues compared with benign prostatic tissues and its overexpression is correlated with poor prognosis. CUL4B promotes proliferation and aggressiveness of PCa cells in vitro. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that CUL4B upregulates the expression of C-MYC at post-transcriptional level through epigenetic silencing of miR-33b-5p. Importantly, CUL4B-induced oncogenic activity in PCa by targeting C-MYC is repressed by miR-33b-5p.

Aspirin, a prodrug of salicylate (SAL), has been associated with improved RT response in clinical PrCa cases, but the potential mechanism mediating this effect is unknown. SAL activates the metabolic stress sensor AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), which inhibits de novo lipogenesis, and protein synthesis via inhibition of Acetyl-CoA Carboxylase (ACC), and the mammalian Target of Rapamycin (mTOR), respectively. RT also activates AMPK through a mechanism distinctly different from SAL. Therefore, combining these two therapies may have synergistic effects on suppressing PrCa. Here, we examined the potential of SAL to enhance the response of human PrCa cells and tumors to RT.  Methods:   Androgen-insensitive (PC3) and -sensitive (LNCaP) PrCa cells were subjected to proliferation and clonogenic survival assays after treatment with clinically relevant doses of SAL and RT. Balb/c nude mice with PC3 xenografts were fed standard chow diet or chow diet supplemented with 2.5 g/kg salsalate (SAL pro-drug dimer) one week prior to a single dose of 0 or 10 Gy RT. Immunoblotting analysis of signaling events in the DNA repair and AMPK-mTOR pathways and lipogenesis were assessed in cells treated with SAL and RT.  Results:   SAL inhibited proliferation and clonogenic survival in PrCa cells and enhanced the inhibition mediated by RT. Salsalate, added to diet, enhanced the anti-tumor effects of RT in PC3 tumor xenografts. RT activated genotoxic stress markers and the activity of mTOR pathway and AMPK and mediated inhibitory phosphorylation of ACC. Interestingly, SAL enhanced the effects of RT on AMPK and ACC but blocked markers of mTOR activation.  Conclusions:   Our results show that SAL can enhance RT responses in PrCa.

Methods:   We retrospectively reviewed 122 Japanese patients who received SRT for BCR after RP. Using uni- and multivariate Cox proportional hazard models, we identified the predictive factors of BCR after SRT.  Results:   With a median follow-up of 61.3 months, 45.9% of the patients showed BCR after SRT, with 61.5 and 41.8% of non-BCR rates at the second and fifth years. Univariate proportional hazards analysis demonstrated that extraprostatic disease (P = 0.029), seminal vesicle invasion (P = 0.005), microvascular invasion (P = 0.001), postoperative Gleason score (P = 0.008) and pre-SRT prostate-specific antigen (PSA) (P = 0.005) were significantly associated with BCR after SRT. However, only the presence of microvascular invasion and a higher pre-SRT PSA were significant predictors in the multivariate analysis. The non-BCR rate in the second year after SRT for 15 patients with microvascular invasion and pre-SRT PSA > 1.2 ng/ml was only 21% compared to 72.5% of 72 patients with negative microvascular invasion and a pre-SRT PSA of <1.2 ng/ml (P = 0.000031).  Conclusions:   While SRT is the most important secondary treatment option for patients with BCR after RP, the effectiveness of SRT may not be uniform.

This study aimed to investigate the regulatory effects of miRNA-5193 on the expression of TRIM11 in prostate cancer tissues compared with adjacent normal prostate, and in human prostate cancer cell lines, PC3 and DU145 in vitro. MATERIAL AND METHODS Prostate tumor tissue and adjacent normal tissue from 137 patients with stage T1c (n=66), stage T2 (n=48), and stage T3 (n=23) prostate cancer were studied. Expression levels of the TRIM 11 protein and the TRIM11 gene in prostate cancer, normal prostate tissue, and human prostate cancer cell lines, PC3 and DU145, were measured by Western blot and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), respectively. Transfection with TRIM11 small interfering RNA (siRNA) resulted in gene knockdown. Transfection with a miR-5193 mimic resulted in overexpression of miR-5193.

Methods:   Thirty-three Pca patients were included. All patients underwent pre- and post-IMRT T2-weighted (T2 W) and apparent diffusing coefficient (ADC) MRI. IMRT response was calculated in terms of changes in the ADC value, and patients were divided as responders and non-responders. A wide range of radiomic features from different feature sets were extracted from all T2 W and ADC images. Univariate radiomic analysis was performed to find highly correlated radiomic features with IMRT response, and a paired t test was used to find significant features between responders and non-responders. To find high predictive radiomic models, tenfold cross-validation as the criterion for feature selection and classification was applied on the pre-, post- and delta IMRT radiomic features, and area under the curve (AUC) of receiver operating characteristics was calculated as model performance value.  Results:   Of 33 patients, 15 patients (45%) were found as responders. Univariate analysis showed 20 highly correlated radiomic features with IMRT response (20 ADC and 20 T2). Two and fifteen T2 and ADC radiomic features were found as significant (P-value ≤ 0.05) features between responders and non-responders, respectively. Several cross-combined predictive radiomic models were obtained, and post-T2 radiomic models were found as high predictive models (AUC 0.632) followed by pre-ADC (AUC 0.626) and pre-T2 (AUC 0.61). For GS prediction, T2 W radiomic models were found as more predictive (mean AUC 0.739) rather than ADC models (mean AUC 0.70), while for stage prediction, ADC models had higher prediction performance (mean AUC 0.675).

We report our experience on 394 patients affected by prostate cancer primarily treated with high-dose, image-guided, IMRT, focusing on gastrointestinal, genitourinary toxicities and biochemical control.  Methods:   From July 2003 to August 2014, 394 patients were treated with radical high-dose radiotherapy (HDRT) for prostate cancer; the mean total radiation dose was 79 Gy in standard fractions. Hormonal therapy (HT) was administered to 7.6% of low-risk patients, to 20.3% of intermediate-risk patients and to 72% of high-risk patients. Patients were evaluated for biochemical failure, local recurrence (LR) and metastases.  Results:   Ninety-seven patients (26.65%) developed acute GU toxicity at the medium dose of 25.4 Gy, grade 1 (G1) or grade 2 (G2) in 94 cases. Only 16 patients (4.06%) reported chronic GU toxicity (G1 or G2), and one case developed G3 cystitis. No G3 GI acute and late toxicity were detected. Fifty-six (14.2%) patients experienced LR, 26 (6.6%) developed metastases and 70 patients (17.8%) were deceased. Gleason sum score > 7 was predictive for worse overall survival (GS = 7 was borderline) and for metastasis. No factors resulted predictive for local relapse.

The improved survival rate has led to a focus on reducing the burden of treatment-related morbidity and improving the patient and partner survivorship experience. Post-rp sexual dysfunction (sdf) has received significant attention, given its substantial effect on patient and partner health-related quality of life. Accordingly, there is a need for sdf treatment to be a fundamental component of pca survivorship programming.  Methods:   Most research about the treatment of post-rp sdf involves biomedical interventions for erectile dysfunction (ed). Although findings support the effectiveness of pro-erectile agents and devices, most patients discontinue use of such aids within 1 year after their rp. Because side effects of pro-erectile treatment have proved to be inadequate in explaining the gap between efficacy and ongoing use, current research focuses on a biopsychosocial perspective of ed. Unfortunately, there is a dearth of literature describing the components of a biopsychosocial program designed for the post-rp population and their partners.  Results:   In this paper, we detail the development of the Prostate Cancer Rehabilitation Clinic (pcrc), which emphasizes multidisciplinary intervention teams, active participation by the partner, and a broad-spectrum medical, psychological, and interpersonal approach.

The overactivation of IL-6/JAK/STAT3 signaling and silencing of SOCS3 are frequently observed in prostate cancer. In the present study we undertook to develop Ad-SOCS3 gene therapy for the treatment of prostate cancer and also investigated whether Ad-SOCS3 increased sensitivity to NK cells. We demonstrated that Ad-SOCS3 could significantly inhibit growth of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) cell lines expressing pSTAT3, DU-145 (at 10, 20, and 40 MOI), and TRAMP-C2 (at 40 MOI), but not the PC-3 CRPC cell line with the STAT3 gene deleted. Ad-SOCS3 (40 MOI) could suppress IL-6 production in DU-145 cells and PD-L1 expression induced by IFN-γ in TRAMP-C2 cells, and increased the NK cell sensitivity of both TRAMP-C2 and DU-145 cells. In the DU-145 mouse xenograft tumor model, intratumoral injections (twice/week for 3 weeks) of 1 × 108 pfu of Ad-SOCS3 significantly inhibited tumor growth and combining the Ad-SOCS3 treatment with intratumoral injections (once/week for 2 weeks) of 1 × 107 human NK cells showed the highest tumor growth inhibitory effect.

However, the effects of targeting most of the 60 different bromodomains found in the human proteome remain unexplored. Here, we investigate the molecular mechanisms responsible for the antiproliferative properties of CREBBP/EP300 bromodomain inhibition in ER-negative breast cancer cell lines. We show using genetic and chemical approaches that CREBBP/EP300 bromodomains are critical to support the proliferation of the triple-negative breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-453. Analysis of the transcriptional pathways affected by CREBBP/EP300 bromodomain inhibitors reveals that the expression of genes associated with super-enhancers is downregulated, which in turn are occupied by very high levels of androgen receptor (AR) in MDA-MB-453 cells. Treatment of MDA-MB-453 with CREBBP/EP300 bromodomain inhibitors downregulates the expression of an AR-dependent signature distinctive of breast cancer tumors that express AR and causes a decrease in H3K27ac levels at AR-binding sites. In accordance, in prostate cancer cell lines that express AR CREBBP/EP300 bromodomain inhibitors downregulate the expression of genes bound by AR and associated with super-enhancers. In summary, we report that triple-negative breast cancer cell lines that express AR are particularly sensitive to CREBBP/EP300 bromodomain inhibitors and consequently these inhibitors hold potential to treat this type of cancer.

Growth factor-independent 1 (GFI1) is a zinc finger transcriptional repressor responsible for controlling secretory cell differentiation in the small intestine and colon. GFI1 plays a significant role in the development of human malignancies, including leukemia, lung cancer, and prostate cancer. However, the role of GFI1 in colorectal cancer progression is largely unknown. Our results demonstrate that RNA and protein expression of GFI1 are reduced in advanced-stage nonmucinous colorectal cancer. Subcutaneous tumor xenograft models demonstrated that the reexpression of GFI1 in 4 different human colorectal cancer cell lines inhibits tumor growth. To further investigate the role of Gfi1 in de novo colorectal tumorigenesis, we developed transgenic mice harboring a deletion of Gfi1 in the colon driven by CDX2-cre (Gfi1F/F; CDX2-cre) and crossed them with ApcMin/+ mice (ApcMin/+; Gfi1F/F; CDX2-cre). Loss of Gfi1 significantly increased the total number of colorectal adenomas compared with littermate controls with an APC mutation alone. Furthermore, we found that compound (ApcMin/+; Gfi1F/F; CDX2-cre) mice develop larger adenomas, invasive carcinoma, as well as hyperplastic lesions expressing the neuroendocrine marker chromogranin A, a feature that has not been previously described in APC-mutant tumors in mice. Collectively, these results demonstrate that GFI1 acts as a tumor suppressor gene in colorectal cancer, where deficiency of Gfi1 promotes malignancy in the colon.

Our previous work demonstrates that adipocytes promote homing of prostate cancer cells to PPAT and that this effect is upregulated by obesity. Here, we show that once tumor cells have invaded PPAT (mimicked by an in vitro model of coculture), they establish a bidirectional crosstalk with adipocytes, which promotes tumor cell invasion. Indeed, tumor cells induce adipocyte lipolysis and the free fatty acids (FFA) released are taken up and stored by tumor cells. Incubation with exogenous lipids also stimulates tumor cell invasion, underlining the importance of lipid transfer in prostate cancer aggressiveness. Transferred FFAs (after coculture or exogenous lipid treatment) stimulate the expression of one isoform of the pro-oxidant enzyme NADPH oxidase, NOX5. NOX5 increases intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) that, in turn, activate a HIF1/MMP14 pathway, which is responsible for the increased tumor cell invasion. In obesity, tumor-surrounding adipocytes are more prone to activate the depicted signaling pathway and to induce tumor invasion. Finally, the expression of NOX5 and MMP14 is upregulated at the invasive front of human tumors where cancer cells are in close proximity to adipocytes and this process is amplified in obese patients, underlining the clinical relevance of our results.

While the AR cis-regulation has been extensively studied in prostate cancer, information pertaining to the spatial architecture of the AR transcriptional circuitry remains limited. In this paper, we propose a novel framework to profile long-range chromatin interactions associated with AR and its collaborative transcription factor, erythroblast transformation-specific related gene (ERG), using chromatin interaction analysis by paired-end tag (ChIA-PET). We identified ERG-associated long-range chromatin interactions as a cooperative component in the AR-associated chromatin interactome, acting in concert to achieve coordinated regulation of a subset of AR target genes. Through multifaceted functional data analysis, we found that AR-ERG interaction hub regions are characterized by distinct functional signatures, including bidirectional transcription and cotranscription factor binding. In addition, cancer-associated long noncoding RNAs were found to be connected near protein-coding genes through AR-ERG looping. Finally, we found strong enrichment of prostate cancer genome-wide association study (GWAS) single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at AR-ERG co-binding sites participating in chromatin interactions and gene regulation, suggesting GWAS target genes identified from chromatin looping data provide more biologically relevant findings than using the nearest gene approach.

The role of PtdIns 4-kinase II β in MCF-7 cells was addressed with the help of short hairpin RNA (shRNA). PtdIns 4-kinase II β shRNA transfection increased pan-caspase activity and induced apoptosis in cancerous MCF-7 cells. Non-cancerous MCF-10A cells were resistant to PtdIns 4-kinase II β shRNA-induced apoptosis. Caspase 8 and 9 inhibitors rescued MCF-7 cells from apoptosis. Shotgun proteomic studies with Flag-tagged PtdIns 4-kinase II β immunoprecipitates showed tumor suppressor prostate apoptosis response-4 (Par-4) as one of the interacting proteins in HEK293 cells. In reciprocal experiments, Par-4 antibodies co-precipitated PtdIns 4-kinase II β from MCF-7 cells. Deletion of membrane localization motif (ΔCCPCC) or a mutation in ATP-binding region (D304A) of PtdIns 4-kinase II β did not affect its interaction with Par-4. Pull-down assays with GST-PtdIns 4-kinase II β-truncated mutants showed that the region between 101 and 215 amino acid residues is essential for interaction with Par-4. At molecular level, PtdIns 4-kinase II β shRNA transfection increased Par-4 stability, its nuclear localization and inhibition of NF-κB binding to target DNA.

Objective:   To assess the impact of depression and anxiety on surgical, oncological, and functional outcomes in radical prostatectomy (RP) patients.  Data, setting, and participants:   Retrospective analysis of 5862 RP patients (2014-2016).  Intervention:   RP.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Baseline depression and anxiety were assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire-4 (PHQ-4) and categorized into 0-2 (normal), 3-5 (mild), and ≥6 (moderate to severe) points. Surgical outcomes included length of hospital stay (LOS), blood loss, and complications (Clavien-Dindo grading). Functional outcomes included urinary incontinence (UI) and erectile dysfunction (ED). Oncological outcomes focused on biochemical recurrence (BCR). Kaplan-Meier plots, multivariable logistic analyses, and Cox regression analyses were used.  Results and limitations:   Overall, 28% patients had abnormal PHQ-4 scores and 8% a score ≥6 points. Higher PHQ-4 was significantly associated with worse surgical outcomes (longer LOS and higher complication rates) and higher risk for UI. No statistically significant difference was found for ED. However, we observed a higher use of phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors and intracavernous injection therapies among men with PHQ-4 score of ≥3. BCR was not affected by PHQ-4. The main limitations are the retrospective design as well as the lack of information on concomitant medications or follow-up PHQ-4 scores.  Conclusions:   Higher PHQ-4 scores are significantly associated with worse surgical outcomes and higher risk for UI. Our study highlights the importance of preoperative depression and anxiety assessment to optimize quality of life and to reduce health-related costs.  Patient summary:   Patients with preoperative depression or anxiety are at higher risk for postoperative complications and urinary incontinence after radical prostatectomy.""","""['Raisa S Pompe', 'Alexander Krüger', 'Felix Preisser', 'Pierre I Karakiewicz', 'Uwe Michl', 'Markus Graefen', 'Hartwig Huland', 'Derya Tilki']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Eur Urol Focus""","""['Do we need the nerve sparing radical prostatectomy techniques (intrafascial vs. interfascial) in men with erectile dysfunction?

It has been reported, that miR-23a-3p promotes the development of tumors for prostate cancer, gastric cancer and gliomas. The functions of miR-23a-3p in OSCC however, remain unclear. In this study, fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) is revealed as a direct target of miR-23a-3p, based on luciferase assays and immunoblotting. The expression of miR-23a-3p and FGF2 were found to be significantly downregulated and upregulated in OSCC tissues respectively. This indicates a reverse correlation between miR-23a-3p and FGF2 levels. Using in vitro approaches we ascertained that miR-23a-3p might contribute to the inhibition of growth and inhibition through increasing apoptosis in OSCC cells; while an inhibitor of miR-23a-3p could reverse this effect. Examination of a clinical cohort of OSCC patients suggested that reduced expression of miR-23a-3p is correlated with more advanced cancerous stage and poorer differentiation of OSCC cell. Additionally, a survival analysis and the Cox-hazard regression model showed that higher levels of miR-23a-3p can be used reliably for prognosis of OSCC patients. This study indicates that miR-23a-3p might suppress tumor proliferation, invasion and promote apoptosis of OSCC by targeting FGF2. miR-23a-3p has the potential to be used as prognostic indicator, and could be exploited as a therapeutic reagent for OSCC in the future.""","""['Fubo Chen', 'Shengcai Qi', 'Xu Zhang', 'Jinjin Wu', 'Xi Yang', 'Raorao Wang']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Pathol Res Pract""","""['Long noncoding RNA UCA1 promotes cell growth, migration, and invasion by targeting miR-143-3p in oral squamous cell carcinoma.', 'Inhibition of miR-103a-3p suppresses the proliferation in oral squamous cell carcinoma cells via targeting RCAN1.', 'MicroRNA-486-3p functions as a tumor suppressor in oral cancer by targeting DDR1.', 'Evaluating the role of microRNAs alterations in oral squamous cell carcinoma.', 'microRNAs in oral cancer: Moving from bench to bed as next generation medicine.', 'miR-23a-3p promotes the development of colon cancer by inhibiting the expression of NDRG4.', 'Silencing of long non-coding RNA TUC338 inhibits the malignant phenotype of nasopharyngeal cancer cells via modulating the miR-1226-3p/FGF2 axis.', 'miR-23a-3p Regulates Runx2 to Inhibit the Proliferation and Metastasis of Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma.', 'Inhibition of lncRNA NEAT1 sensitizes medulloblastoma cells to cisplatin through modulating the miR-23a-3p-glutaminase (GLS) axis.', 'miR-23a-3p inhibits sepsis-induced kidney epithelial cell injury by suppressing Wnt/β-catenin signaling by targeting wnt5a.']"""

The mean diameter of DTX-loaded core-crosslinked PGC-LA (DTX-PGC-LA/cc) micelles was 397 nm determined by dynamic light scattering (DLS). In vitro DTX released from core-crosslinked micelles was slower than that from non-crosslinked counterpart. Blank micelles exhibited good biocompatibility. Additionally, cellular uptake and cytotoxcity of PCP-modified micelles were higher than those of micelles without PCP in PSMA-positive LNCaP cells.

Whether less resource-intensive exercise delivery models are as effective remains to be established. We determined the feasibility of conducting a multi-center non-inferiority randomized controlled trial comparing PT with supervised group (GROUP) and home-based (HOME) exercise programs, and obtained preliminary efficacy estimates for GROUP and HOME compared to PT on quality of life (QOL) and physical fitness.  Methods:   Men with prostate cancer on ADT were recruited from one of two experienced Canadian centres and randomized 1:1:1 to PT, GROUP, or HOME. Randomization was stratified by length of ADT use and site. Participants completed moderate intensity aerobic and resistance exercises 4-5 days per week for 6 months with a target 150 min per week of exercise. Exercise prescriptions were individualized and progressed throughout the trial. Feasibility endpoints included recruitment, retention, adherence, and participant satisfaction. The efficacy endpoints QOL, fatigue, and fitness (VO2 peak, grip strength, and timed chair stands) in GROUP and HOME were compared for non-inferiority to PT. Descriptive analyses were used for feasibility endpoints. Between-group differences for efficacy endpoints were examined using Bayesian linear mixed effects models.  Results:   Fifty-nine participants (mean age 69.9 years) were enrolled. The recruitment rate was 25.4% and recruitment was slower than projected. Retention was 71.2%. Exercise adherence as measured through attendance was high for supervised sessions but under 50% by self-report and accelerometry. Satisfaction was high and there was no difference in this measure between all three groups. Between-group differences (comparing both GROUP and HOME to PT) were smaller than the minimum clinically important difference on most measures of QOL, fatigue, and fitness. However, two of six outcomes for GROUP and four of six outcomes for HOME had a > 20% probability of being inferior for GROUP.  Conclusions:   Feasibility endpoints were generally met. Both GROUP and HOME interventions in men with PC on ADT appeared to be similar to PT for multiple efficacy outcomes, although conclusions are limited by a small sample size and cost considerations have not been incorporated.

Currently, human cancer metastasis is largely studied using transgenic and immunocompromised mouse xenograft models, which are useful for analysing end-point tumour growth but are unable to accurately and reliably monitor in vivo invasion, intravasation, extravasation or secondary tumour formation of human cancer cells. Furthermore, limits in our ability to accurately monitor early stages of tumour growth and detect micro-metastases likely results in pain and suffering to the mice used for cancer xenograft experiments. Zebrafish ( Danio rerio) embryos, however, offer many advantages as a model system for studying the complex, multi-step processes involved during cancer metastasis. This article describes a detailed method for the analysis of human cancer cell invasion and metastasis in zebrafish embryos before they reach protected status at 5 days post fertilisation. Results demonstrate that human cancer cells actively invade within a zebrafish microenvironment, and form metastatic tumours at secondary tissue sites, suggesting that the mechanisms involved during the different stages of metastasis are conserved between humans and zebrafish, supporting the use of zebrafish embryos as a viable model of human cancer metastasis. We suggest that the embryonic zebrafish xenograft model of human cancer is a tractable laboratory model that can be used to understand cancer biology, and as a direct replacement of mice for the analysis of drugs that target cancer invasion and metastasis.""","""['David Hill', 'Lanpeng Chen', 'Ewe Snaar-Jagalska', 'Bill Chaudhry']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""F1000Res""","""['Cancer Cell Invasion and Metastasis in Zebrafish Models (Danio rerio).', 'Transforming growth factor-β signalling controls human breast cancer metastasis in a zebrafish xenograft model.', 'Zebrafish Embryo Xenograft and Metastasis Assay.', 'Zebrafish xenograft models of cancer and metastasis for drug discovery.', 'Zebrafish embryo as a tool to study tumor/endothelial cell cross-talk.', 'One Host-Multiple Applications: Zebrafish (Danio rerio) as Promising Model for Studying Human Cancers and Pathogenic Diseases.', 'Hyperactive Akt1 Signaling Increases Tumor Progression and DNA Repair in Embryonal Rhabdomyosarcoma RD Line and Confers Susceptibility to Glycolysis and Mevalonate Pathway Inhibitors.', 'Photosubstitution in a trisheteroleptic ruthenium complex inhibits conjunctival melanoma growth in a zebrafish orthotopic xenograft model.', 'Identifying drivers of breast cancer metastasis in progressively invasive subpopulations of zebrafish-xenografted MDA-MB-231.', 'What Zebrafish and Nanotechnology Can Offer for Cancer Treatments in the Age of Personalized Medicine.']"""

During 2001 to 2004, we conducted a phase 1 pilot study assessing the role of short-course preoperative RT (PreORT) for men with unfavorable intermediate- and high-risk localized prostate cancer. Herein, we present long-term follow-up toxicity and oncologic outcomes.  Methods and materials:   Eligible patients had histologically proven prostate cancer, cT1-T2N0M0 disease, prostate-specific antigen >15 to 35 ng/mL regardless of Gleason score, or prostate-specific antigen 10 to 15 ng/mL with Gleason score ≥7. Patients received 25 Gy in 5 consecutive daily fractions (5 Gy per fraction) to the prostate only, followed by radical prostatectomy within 14 days after RT completion. Primary outcomes were intraoperative morbidity and late genitourinary (GU) and gastrointestinal toxicities.  Results:   In total, 15 patients were enrolled; 14 patients completed PreORT followed by radical prostatectomy, which also included bilateral lymph node dissections in 13 cases. Median follow-up was 12.2 years (range, 6.7-16.3). Late GU toxicity was common, with 2 patients (13.3%) experiencing G2 toxicity and 6 patients (40%) G3 toxicity. There were no patients with G4 to G5 late GU toxicity. Late gastrointestinal toxicity was infrequent, with only 1 patient (6.7%) experiencing transient G2 proctitis. At last follow-up, 8 (53.3%) and 6 (40%) patients experienced biochemical and metastatic disease recurrence, respectively.  Conclusions:   The use of PreORT in men with high-risk prostate cancer is associated with unexpected high rates of late GU toxicity. Future studies examining the role of RT preradical prostatectomy must cautiously select RT technique and dose schedule.

This prospective multicenter cohort study evaluated the prevalence and effect of germline DDR (gDDR) mutations on metastatic castration-resistance prostate cancer (mCRPC) outcomes.  Patients and methods:   Unselected patients were enrolled at diagnosis of mCRPC and were screened for gDDR mutations in 107 genes. The primary aim was to assess the impact of ATM/BRCA1/BRCA2/ PALB2 germline mutations on cause-specific survival (CSS) from diagnosis of mCRPC. Secondary aims included the association of gDDR subgroups with response outcomes for mCRPC treatments. Combined progression-free survival from the first systemic therapy (PFS) until progression on the second systemic therapy (PFS2) was also explored.  Results:   We identified 68 carriers (16.2%) of 419 eligible patients, including 14 with BRCA2, eight with ATM, four with BRCA1, and none with PALB2 mutations. The study did not reach its primary end point, because the difference in CSS between ATM/BRCA1/BRCA2/PALB2 carriers and noncarriers was not statistically significant (23.3 v 33.2 months; P = .264). CSS was halved in germline BRCA2 (g BRCA2) carriers (17.4 v 33.2 months; P = .027), and g BRCA2 mutations were identified as an independent prognostic factor for CCS (hazard ratio [HR], 2.11; P = .033). Significant interactions between g BRCA2 status and treatment type (androgen signaling inhibitor v taxane therapy) were observed (CSS adjusted P = .014; PFS2 adjusted P = .005). CSS (24.0 v 17.0 months) and PFS2 (18.9 v 8.6 months) were greater in g BRCA2 carriers treated in first line with abiraterone or enzalutamide compared with taxanes. Clinical outcomes did not differ by treatment type in noncarriers.  Conclusion:   g BRCA2 mutations have a deleterious impact on mCRPC outcomes that may be affected by the first line of treatment used. Determination of g BRCA2 status may be of assistance for the selection of the initial treatment in mCRPC.

An important reason for this high mortality is that early disease is typically asymptomatic, and patients often present with advanced, incurable disease. Even in high-risk patients who routinely undergo endoscopic screening, lesions can be missed due to their small size or subtle appearance. Thus, current imaging approaches lack the sensitivity and specificity to accurately detect incipient GI tract cancers. Here we report our finding that a single dose of a high-sensitivity surface-enhanced resonance Raman scattering nanoparticle (SERRS-NP) enables reliable detection of precancerous GI lesions in animal models that closely mimic disease development in humans. Some of these animal models have not been used previously to evaluate imaging probes for early cancer detection. The studies were performed using a commercial Raman imaging system, a newly developed mouse Raman endoscope, and finally a clinically applicable Raman endoscope for larger animal studies. We show that this SERRS-NP-based approach enables robust detection of small, premalignant lesions in animal models that faithfully recapitulate human esophageal, gastric, and colorectal tumorigenesis.

The increase was particularly pronounced for melanoma (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 2.59; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 2.18-3.00) and cancers of the breast (aHR, 1.88; 95% CI, 1.61-2.19), bladder (aHR, 1.85; 95% CI, 1.58-2.17), and colorectum (aHR, 1.77; 95% CI, 1.60-1.96), but it also was increased for cancers of the oral cavity/pharynx, stomach, pancreas, kidney, and lung as well as diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (aHR range, 1.21-1.47). Associations remained significant after adjustment for first-course cancer treatment and generally were stronger among patients with local-stage cancers for whom potentially curative treatment was provided, including patients with melanoma (aHR, 3.82; 95% CI, 2.94-4.97) and cancers of the colorectum (aHR, 2.77; 95% CI, 2.07-3.70), breast (aHR, 2.08; 95% CI, 1.50-2.88), and prostate (aHR, 1.60; 95% CI, 1.12-2.29), despite the lack of an association for prostate cancer overall.  Conclusions:   For multiple cancer types, transplant recipients with cancer appear to have an elevated risk of dying of their cancer, even after adjustment for stage and treatment, which may be due to impaired immunity.""","""[""Monica E D'Arcy"", 'Anna E Coghill', 'Charles F Lynch', 'Lori A Koch', 'Jie Li', 'Karen S Pawlish', 'Cyllene R Morris', 'Chandrika Rao', 'Eric A Engels']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Cancer""","""['Improving cancer-specific outcomes in solid organ transplant recipients: Where to begin?', 'Solid Organ Transplantation and Survival among Individuals with a History of Cancer.', 'Sebaceous Carcinoma Incidence and Survival Among Solid Organ Transplant Recipients in the United States, 1987-2017.', 'Melanoma incidence, stage, and survival after solid organ transplant: A population-based cohort study in Ontario, Canada.', 'Incidence and outcomes of primary central nervous system lymphoma in solid organ transplant recipients.', 'Mortality among solid organ transplant recipients with a pretransplant cancer diagnosis.', 'Assessment of prognostic role of a novel 7-lncRNA signature in HCC patients.', 'Safety evaluation of curative gastrectomy for gastric cancer patients who underwent liver transplantation: a comparative study with conventional gastrectomy for gastric cancer patients.', 'Dampened Inflammatory Signalling and Myeloid-Derived Suppressor-Like Cell Accumulation Reduces Circulating Monocytic HLA-DR Density and May Associate With Malignancy Risk in Long-Term Renal Transplant Recipients.', 'Liver transplantation does not increase morbidity or mortality in women undergoing surgery for breast cancer.', 'Immune-related conditions and cancer-specific mortality among older adults with cancer in the United States.']"""

However, little is known about the effect of vitamin K intake on prostate cancer in human populations.  Objectives:   We evaluated the associations of dietary intake of phylloquinone (vitamin K-1), menaquinones (vitamin K-2), and total vitamin K with the development of prostate cancer among participants in the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer (PLCO) Screening Trial.  Design:   Dietary intake of vitamin K was assessed with the Dietary Questionnaire (DQX) at baseline and the Dietary History Questionnaire (DHQ) at the third anniversary of randomization by using high-performance liquid chromatography-based food-composition data obtained from the USDA and published studies. During a median follow-up of 11.8 y, 2978 cases of prostate cancer (including 490 advanced cases) were identified from the 28,356 men who completed DQX. Similarly, 2973 cases of prostate cancer (including 647 advanced cases) were documented from the 48,090 men who completed DHQ. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to estimate prostate cancer risk in relation to the dietary intake of vitamin K.  Results:   After adjustment for confounders, dietary intakes of phylloquinone, menaquinones, and total vitamin K, assessed with either the DQX or DHQ, were not significantly associated with the risk of advanced, nonadvanced, and total prostate cancer. These results remained virtually the same when vitamin K intake was modeled as a categorical (divided into quintiles) or continuous (per IQR increase) variable or after outliers of total vitamin K intake (defined as a value that falls above the sum of third quartile and twice the IQR) were excluded.

Methods to minimize the deformation of the prostate caused by the probe at 3-D imaging and needle targeting were developed to reduce biopsy targeting errors. We also present a prostate coordinate system (PCS). The PCS helps defining a systematic biopsy plan without the need for prostate segmentation. Comprehensive tests were performed, including two bench tests, one imaging test, two in vitro targeting tests, and an IRB-approved clinical trial on five patients. Preclinical tests showed that image-based needle targeting can be accomplished with accuracy on the order of 1 mm. Prostate biopsy can be accomplished with minimal TRUS pressure on the gland and submillimetric prostate deformations. All five clinical cases were successful with an average procedure time of 13 min and millimeter targeting accuracy. Hands-free TRUS operation, transrectal TRUS guided prostate biopsy with minimal prostate deformations, and the PCS-based biopsy plan are novel methods. Robot-assisted prostate biopsy is safe and feasible.

For treatment of renal cell carcinoma (RCC), this change has not previously been reported. We evaluated trends in surgical management of RCC in Kaiser Permanente Southern California (KPSC) within the last 16 years, especially after adoption of robotics.  Methods:   From January 1999 to September 2015, all KPSC members who underwent surgical treatment of suspected RCC were included retrospectively. Surgical approach, patient age, sex, clinicopathology, Charlson Comorbidity Index, and chronic kidney disease status were analyzed using robust Poisson multivariate regression.  Results:   The study included 5237 patients. Partial nephrectomy was increasingly used during the study period, and its use surpassed radical nephrectomy in 2012. In a multivariate model, partial nephrectomy was associated with lower pathologic tumor stage (p < 0.001) and lower Charlson Comorbidity Index (p = 0.004) vs radical nephrectomy. Robot-assisted laparoscopic partial nephrectomy (RALPN) started in KPSC in March 2011, and its relative use among all RCC surgeries increased in the following 3 years by 125%, 45%, and 14%. Laparoscopic partial nephrectomy and laparoscopic radical nephrectomy were the most frequently used surgical approaches for localized RCC when RALPN started in 2011. However, RALPN surpassed laparoscopic partial nephrectomy and laparoscopic radical nephrectomy in 2012 and 2014, respectively.  Conclusion:   During our study, partial nephrectomy became the most common surgery for treatment of localized RCC. Since 2014, RALPN has become the most common renal oncologic surgical modality in KPSC.""","""['Ramzi B Jabaji', 'Heidi Fischer', 'Tyler Kern', 'Gary W Chien']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Perm J""","""['Comparison of Hand-Assisted Laparoscopic vs Robot-Assisted Laparoscopic vs Open Partial Nephrectomy in Patients with T1 Renal Masses.', 'Predictive Factors for Achieving Superior Pentafecta Outcomes Following Robot-Assisted Partial Nephrectomy in Patients with Localized Renal Cell Carcinoma.', 'Robot-assisted laparoscopic partial nephrectomy using daVinci S-surgical system for localized renal tumor: report of initial five cases.', 'Choice of Surgical Options in Kidney Cancer and Surgical Complications.', 'Laparoscopic and partial nephrectomy.', 'SF3B4 promotes Twist1 expression and clear cell renal cell carcinoma progression by facilitating the export of KLF 16 mRNA from the nucleus to the cytoplasm.', 'Effects of Angelica Fritillaria Kushen Pill on Renal Function and Immune Function after Laparoscopic Radical Nephrectomy for Patients with Renal Carcinoma.', 'Robotic surgery for cT2 kidney cancer: analysis of the National Cancer Database.', 'Synergistic Effects of TW-37 and ABT-263 on Renal Cell Carcinoma Cells.', 'Local ablation vs partial nephrectomy in T1N0M0 renal cell carcinoma: An inverse probability of treatment weighting analysis.']"""

This may partially explain the differences between these agents on prostate cancer outcomes. In this post-hoc analysis, FSH and prostate specific antigen (PSA) responses and the impact of cross-over from leuprolide to degarelix were evaluated from a 1-year comparative study (CS21) and its extension study (CS21A).  Materials and methods:   Overall, 610 patients were enrolled in CS21, wherein PSA and FSH levels were evaluated monthly. CS21A evaluated 386 patients, including those previously treated with degarelix (n = 251) who continued to receive degarelix, and those previously treated with leuprolide (n = 135) who crossed-over to receive degarelix. PSA and FSH levels were evaluated in CS21A for 3 months after cross-over. The associations between measurements were assessed using Spearman's correlation coefficient. The impact of class variables on FSH suppression were evaluated using Analysis of Variance.  Results:   Rapid PSA and FSH suppression was observed and maintained in the degarelix arm (CS21 and CS21A), while patients on leuprolide experienced rising PSA during CS21. Patients crossed-over from leuprolide to degarelix achieved a suppression of FSH and a significant PSA decrease. PSA and FSH levels were significantly (p < .05) correlated at months 1, 3, 6, 12 and 13 in the degarelix arm.  Conclusions:   Significant FSH suppression with GnRH antagonists may explain its advantage over GnRH agonists in terms of better prostate cancer control. The effect of profound FSH suppression is analogous to the need for profound testosterone suppression for tumor control.""","""['E David Crawford', 'B Tombal', 'T Keane', 'F Boccardo', 'K Miller', 'N Shore', 'J W Moul', 'J-E Damber', 'L Collette', 'B-E Persson']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Scand J Urol""","""['The efficacy and safety of degarelix: a 12-month, comparative, randomized, open-label, parallel-group phase III study in patients with prostate cancer.', 'A phase III extension trial with a 1-arm crossover from leuprolide to degarelix: comparison of gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist and antagonist effect on prostate cancer.', 'The effect of baseline testosterone on the efficacy of degarelix and leuprolide: further insights from a 12-month, comparative, phase III study in prostate cancer patients.', 'Gonadotropin-releasing hormone: an update review of the antagonists versus agonists.', 'Degarelix: a gonadotropin-releasing hormone antagonist for the management of prostate cancer.', 'Impact of add-back FSH on human and mouse prostate following gonadotropin ablation by GnRH antagonist treatment.', 'Degarelix for treating advanced hormone-sensitive prostate cancer.', 'Estetrol Cotreatment of Androgen Deprivation Therapy in Infiltrating or Metastatic, Castration-sensitive Prostate Cancer: A Randomized, Double-blind, Phase II Trial (PCombi).', 'Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels prior to prostatectomy are not related to long-term oncologic or cardiovascular outcomes for men with prostate cancer.', 'Dissecting the Hormonal Signaling Landscape in Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.']"""

Additional and innovative measures are warranted to reduce this health disparity. Here, we focused on the identification of a novel serum exosome-based ""protein signature"" for potential use in the early detection and better prognosis of PCa in African American men. Nanoparticle tracking analyses showed that compared to healthy individuals, exosome concentration (number/ml) was increased by ~3.2-fold (P ˂ 0.05) in the sera of African American men with PCa. Mass spectrometry-based proteomic analysis of serum exosomes identified seven unique and fifty-five overlapping proteins (up- or downregulated) in African Americans with PCa compared to healthy African Americans. Furthermore, ingenuity pathway analyses identified the inflammatory acute-phase response signaling as the top pathway associated with proteins loaded in exosomes from African American PCa patients. Interestingly, African American PCa E006AA-hT cells secreted exosomes strongly induced a proinflammatory M2-phenotype in macrophages and showed calcium response on sensory neurons, suggesting a neuroinflammatory response. Additionally, proteomic analyses showed that the protein Isoform 2 of Filamin A has higher loading (2.6-fold) in exosomes from African Americans with PCa, but a lesser loading (0.6-fold) was observed in exosomes from Caucasian men with PCa compared to race-matched healthy individuals. Interestingly, TCGA and Taylor's dataset as well as IHC analyses of PCa tissue showed a lower Filamin A expression in tissues of PCa patients compared with normal subjects. Overall, these results support the usefulness of serum exosomes to noninvasively detect inflammatory phenotype and to discover novel biomarkers associated with PCa in African American men.""","""['Gati K Panigrahi', 'Prakash P Praharaj', 'Hiroki Kittaka', 'Asit R Mridha', 'Olen M Black', 'Rakesh Singh', 'Roger Mercer', 'Adrie van Bokhoven', 'Kathleen C Torkko', 'Chapla Agarwal', 'Rajesh Agarwal', 'Zakaria Y Abd Elmageed', 'Hariom Yadav', 'Santosh K Mishra', 'Gagan Deep']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Cancer Med""","""['Hypoxia-induced exosome secretion promotes survival of African-American and Caucasian prostate cancer cells.', 'Exosomes-based biomarker discovery for diagnosis and prognosis of prostate cancer.', 'Proteomic Profiling of Serum-Derived Exosomes from Ethnically Diverse Prostate Cancer Patients.', 'Using Serological Proteome Analysis to Identify Serum Anti-Nucleophosmin 1 Autoantibody as a Potential Biomarker in European-American and African-American Patients With Prostate Cancer.', 'Racial disparity in prostate cancer in the African American population with actionable ideas and novel immunotherapies.', 'Risk of Prostate Cancer in Chronic Kidney Disease Patient: A Meta-Analysis using Observational Studies.', 'Plasma exosomal protein PLG and SERPINA1 in colorectal cancer diagnosis and coagulation abnormalities.', 'The Roles of Exosomal Proteins: Classification, Function, and Applications.', 'Bridging Health Disparities: a Genomics and Transcriptomics Analysis by Race in Prostate Cancer.', 'Synthesis of Quinoline-2-Carboxylic Acid Aryl Ester and Its Apoptotic Action on PC3 Prostate Cancer Cell Line.']"""

To assess the degree of heterogeneity of 5q21 deletions and their relationship with TMPRSS2:ERG status and 6q15 deletions in prostate cancer, a heterogeneity tissue microarray including 10 tissue spots from 10 different areas of 317 cancers was analyzed by fluorescence in situ hybridization for 5q21 deletion. Data on 6q and ERG were available from earlier studies. Deletions of 5q21 were found in 23% of 265 interpretable cancers and showed marked intratumoral heterogeneity. In the subset of 246 cancers with at least 3 interpretable spots, 23% had a 5q21 deletion. Heterogeneous 5q21 deletions were found in 71% and homogeneous in 29% of these cancers. The likelihood of 5q21 deletion was twice as high in ERG-negative (28%) than in ERG-positive cancers (16%, P = .024). In all 21 cases harboring both alterations, the tumor area containing a 5q21 deletion was smaller or equally large than the ERG-positive area but never larger. Deletions of 5q and 6q were significantly linked. However, the analysis of 32 tumors harboring both deletions did not suggest a specific order of appearance of these deletions. The 5q21 deletion preceded 6q15 in 10 tumors and 6q15 preceded 5q21 in 14 tumors. In summary, our study identifies 5q21 deletion as a highly heterogeneous aberration in prostate cancer that usually occurs late during cancer progression.

Osteoid production suggests a close relationship with normal osteoblasts, and the latter are the presumptive cell of origin of this disease. The HACE1 gene, localized to human chromosome 6q21, encodes the HACE1 HECT E3 ligase, a tumor suppressor in diverse tumors that acts in part by targeting the activated form of RAC1 GTPase for proteasomal degradation. Disruption or loss of 6q21 is relatively common in osteosarcomas, and Hace1-/-/Tp53+/- mice frequently develop osteosarcomas, in contrast to Tp53+/- mice, which do not. This suggests an unexplored link between HACE1 loss and osteosarcoma. Here we compared HACE1 expression in normal osteoblasts and osteosarcoma cell lines in vitro by western blotting and quantitative RT-PCR, and in human osteosarcoma specimens by immunohistochemistry. Both HACE1 transcript and protein levels were reduced in osteosarcoma compared to osteoblasts in vitro. Reduced HACE1 expression in osteosarcoma tumors was observed in 76% of cases and associated with high-grade lesions. Further, clonally derived pairs of high and low metastatic osteosarcoma cell lines showed significant downregulation in the high compared to corresponding low metastatic cells. Ectopic expression of HACE1 markedly inhibited anchorage-independent growth and cell motility of HACE1 osteosarcoma cell lines, and was associated with reduced RAC1 activation and decreased reactive oxygen species (ROS). Finally, HACE1 overexpression blocked osteosarcoma xenograft growth and dramatically reduced pulmonary metastases. These findings point to a potential tumor suppressor function for HACE1 in osteosarcoma.""","""['Amal M El-Naggar', 'Paul W Clarkson', 'Gian Luca Negri', 'Busra Turgu', 'Fan Zhang', 'Michael S Anglesio', 'Poul H Sorensen']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Cell Death Dis""","""['Hace1 controls ROS generation of vertebrate Rac1-dependent NADPH oxidase complexes.', 'HACE1 Prevents Lung Carcinogenesis via Inhibition of RAC-Family GTPases.', 'Loss of the tumor suppressor Hace1 leads to ROS-dependent glutamine addiction.', 'Loss of the Tumor Suppressor HACE1 Contributes to Cancer Progression.', 'Ubiquitylation of active Rac1 by the E3 ubiquitin-ligase HACE1.', 'Cellular functions and molecular mechanisms of ubiquitination in osteosarcoma.', 'Current Status and Prospects of Targeted Therapy for Osteosarcoma.', 'Ubiquitylation of cyclin C by HACE1 regulates cisplatin-associated sensitivity in gastric cancer.', 'Adaptation of the Golgi Apparatus in Cancer Cell Invasion and Metastasis.', 'Osteosarcoma and Metastasis.']"""

However, the function of USP44 in prostate cancers and regulatory mechanism of histone-modifying enzymes by USP44 in tumors is not well-understood. Here, we found that enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2), a histone H3 lysine 27 methyltransferase, is regulated by USP44. We showed that EZH2 is a novel target of USP44 and that the protein stability of EZH2 is upregulated by USP44-mediated deubiquitination. In USP44 knockdown prostate cancer cells, the EZH2 protein level and its gene silencing activity were decreased. Furthermore, USP44 knockdown inhibited the tumorigenic characteristics and cancer stem cell-like behaviors of prostate cancer cells. Inhibition of tumorigenesis caused by USP44 knockdown was recovered by ectopic introduction of EZH2. Additionally, USP44 regulates the protein stability of oncogenic EZH2 mutants. Taken together, our results suggest that USP44 promotes the tumorigenesis of prostate cancer cells partly by stabilizing EZH2 and that USP44 is a viable therapeutic target for treating EZH2-dependent cancers.""","""['Jae Min Park', 'Jae Eun Lee', 'Chan Mi Park', 'Jung Hwa Kim']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Mol Cells""","""['SKP2 loss destabilizes EZH2 by promoting TRAF6-mediated ubiquitination to suppress prostate cancer.', 'BRCA1 and EZH2 cooperate in regulation of prostate cancer stem cell phenotype.', 'Polycomb- and Methylation-Independent Roles of EZH2 as a Transcription Activator.', 'Functional and therapeutic significance of EZH2 in urological cancers.', 'Role of EZH2 in cancer stem cells: from biological insight to a therapeutic target.', 'Integrated network findings reveal ubiquitin-specific protease 44 overexpression suppresses tumorigenicity of liver cancer.', 'Ubiquitin specific peptidases and prostate cancer.', 'USP44 accelerates the growth of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia through interacting with WDR5 and repressing its ubiquitination.', 'PSMA1 mediates tumor progression and poor prognosis of gastric carcinoma by deubiquitinating and stabilizing TAZ.', 'Insight into the physiological and pathological roles of USP44, a potential tumor target (Review).']"""

Background:   Oncology patients with severe AS are often denied valve replacement. TAVR may be an emerging treatment option.  Methods:   A worldwide registry was designed to collect data on patients who undergo TAVR while having active malignancy. Data from 222 cancer patients from 18 TAVR centers were compared versus 2,522 ""no-cancer"" patients from 5 participating centers. Propensity-score matching was performed to further adjust for bias.  Results:   Cancer patients' age was 78.8 ± 7.5 years, STS score 4.9 ± 3.4%, 62% men. Most frequent cancers were gastrointestinal (22%), prostate (16%), breast (15%), hematologic (15%), and lung (11%). At the time of TAVR, 40% had stage 4 cancer. Periprocedural complications were comparable between the groups. Although 30-day mortality was similar, 1-year mortality was higher in cancer patients (15% vs. 9%; p < 0.001); one-half of the deaths were due to neoplasm. Among patients who survived 1 year after the TAVR, one-third were in remission/cured from cancer. Progressive malignancy (stage III to IV) was a strong mortality predictor (hazard ratio: 2.37; 95% confidence interval: 1.74 to 3.23; p < 0.001), whereas stage I to II cancer was not associated with higher mortality compared with no-cancer patients.  Conclusions:   TAVR in cancer patients is associated with similar short-term but worse long-term prognosis compared with patients without cancer. Among this cohort, mortality is largely driven by cancer, and progressive malignancy is a strong mortality predictor. Importantly, 85% of the patients were alive at 1 year, one-third were in remission/cured from cancer.

Although the cause of RT-induced ED is unknown, damage to both the neuronal and vascular components supporting erections are often implicated.  Aim:   To determine the effects of prostatic RT on erections, penile vascular physiology, and major pelvic ganglia (MPG) neuron growth and survival in a rat model.  Methods:   Male rats underwent 0 Gy or 22 Gy single fraction of prostate-confined, conformal RT. At 2 weeks or 10 weeks post-RT (n = 10/group), cavernous nerve stimulation was performed and erections were assessed. Tissue bath experiments were performed to assess both penile artery and internal pudendal artery (IPA) function. MPGs were dissociated and neurons grown in culture for 72 hours. Immunofluorescence staining was done to quantify neuron survival (terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase nick-end labeling), outgrowth (beta-tubulin III), type (nitric oxide synthase [nNOS] and tyrosine hydroxylase [TH]), and nerve injury markers (small GTPase Rac1 and ninjurin-1 [Ninj-1]). Whole MPG real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) was performed to measure expression of genes related to nerve type, neuron injury, repair, and myelination, such as Ninj-1, Rac1, ATF3, GAP43, GFAP, SOX10, and KROX20.  Outcomes:   Intracavernosal pressure (ICP) to mean arterial pressure (MAP) ratio, smooth muscle contractility and relaxation, gene expression, neuritogenesis, and apoptosis.  Results:   Following RT, ICP/MAP was unchanged at 2 weeks or 10 weeks. Nerve-mediated penile contraction was increased at 2 weeks, whereas adrenergic contraction was reduced at 10 weeks. Penile relaxation and IPA vasoreactivity were unchanged. Neuronal apoptosis was more than doubled both early and late post-RT. RT caused a progressive decrease in neurite branching but an early increase and then late decrease in neurite lengthening. RT reduced the numbers of nNOS-positive neurons both early and late and also decreased MPG nitrergic gene expression. TH neurons and gene expression were unchanged at 2 weeks; however, both were decreased after 10 weeks. Although most markers of gene injury and repair were unaffected early post-RT, MPG expression of Ninj1 and GFAP increased. After 10 weeks, Ninj1 and GFAP remained elevated while markers of neuron injury (ATF3), outgrowth (GAP43 and Rac1), and myelin regulation (SOX10) were decreased.  Clinical translation:   RT-induced ED may result from damage to the ganglia controlling erections.  Strengths & limitations:   This study used a clinically relevant, prostate-confined model to examine neurovascular structures not accessible in human studies. Unfortunately, rats did not exhibit ED at this time point.  Conclusion:   This is the first study to demonstrate impaired health and regeneration potential of dissociated MPG neurons following RT. Neuronal injury was apparent early post-RT and persisted or increased over time but was insufficient to cause ED at the time points examined. Powers SA, Odom MR, Pak ES, et al.

However, the precise biological function of miR-501-3p in prostate cancer remains unknown. In this study, we aimed to investigate the regulatory effect and mechanism of miR-501-3p on cell growth of prostate cancer cells. We found that miR-501-3p expression was significantly downregulated in prostate cancer tissues and cell lines. Gain-of-function experiments showed that upregulation of miR-501-3p expression significantly decreased cell proliferation and colony formation, and induced cell cycle arrest in the G0/G1 phase. Bioinformatics analysis predicted that cell cycle-related and expression-elevated protein in tumor (CREPT) was a potential target gene of miR-501-3p., and the results of our luciferase reporter assay confirmed that miR-501-3p bound to the 3'-untranslated region of CREPT at the predicted binding site. Moreover, miR-501-3p was shown to negatively regulate CREPT expression in prostate cancer cells. Correlation analysis showed that miR-501-3p was inversely correlated with CREPT expression in prostate cancer tissues. Knockdown studies revealed that miR-501-3p regulated the expression of cyclin D1 by targeting CREPT. Additionally, the inhibitory effect of miR-501-3p on prostate cancer cell growth was partially reversed by CREPT overexpression. Overall, these results suggest that miR-501-3p restricts prostate cancer cell growth by targeting CREPT to inhibit the expression of cyclin D1.

PFD treatment suppressed the growth of all PCa cells. Transforming growth factor β1 secretion was significantly increased in PFD-treated PCa cells. In both LNCaP and PC-3 cells, PFD treatment increased the population of cells in the G₀/G₁ phase, which was accompanied by a decrease in the S/G₂ cell population.

SET2-induced inhibition of TRPV2 reduced prostate cancer migration, which indicated TRPV2 as an antimetastasis therapeutic target.

Toll-like receptor (TLR) 2 has been reported to be associated with inflammatory diseases, such as infections, autoimmune diseases, and cancers. Meanwhile, TLR10, which can form heterodimers with TLR2, has been considered an orphan receptor without an exact function. The present study therefore aims to examine the effects of TLR2 and TLR10 on PI. Prostate samples and clinical data were obtained from the patients diagnosed with benign prostatic hyperplasia. The inflammatory cell model was established by adding lipopolysaccharide to RWPE-1 cells. Prostate tissues/cells were examined by histological, molecular, and biochemical approaches. Both TLR2 and TLR10 were found to be expressed in prostate tissues and RWPE-1 cells. mRNA/protein expression levels of TLR2 and TLR10 were both positively correlated with prostate tissue inflammatory grades. Lipopolysaccharide-stimulated RWPE-1 cells expressed higher levels of TLR2, TLR10, high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), phospho-nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B-cells P65 (phospho-NF-κB P65), interleukin (IL)-6, and IL-8 than control cells. Moreover, HMGB1, phospho-NF-κB P65, IL-6, and IL-8 were downregulated after TLR2 knockdown and upregulated after TLR10 knockdown in RWPE-1 cells. TLR2 stimulation can activate the inflammatory signaling cascade in prostate epithelial cells. Conversely, TLR10 exhibited suppressive effects on inflammation. With antagonistic functions, both TLR2 and TLR10 were involved in PI. TLR10 could be a novel target in modulating inflammatory signal transduction of prostate epithelial cells.""","""['Yu Fan', 'Lu Yang', 'Qiang Wei', 'Yu Ding', 'Zhuang Tang', 'Ping Tan', 'Tao Lin', 'Duan Guo', 'Shi Qiu']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Asian J Androl""","""['1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D3 up-regulates TLR10 while down-regulating TLR2, 4, and 5 in human monocyte THP-1.', 'Human TLR10 is an anti-inflammatory pattern-recognition receptor.', 'Toll-like Receptor 10 in Helicobacter pylori Infection.', 'TLR10: Insights, controversies and potential utility as a therapeutic target.', 'The Toll-like Receptor 2 (TLR2)-related Immunopathological Responses in the Multiple Sclerosis and Experimental Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis.', 'Differential Gene Expression Induced by Different TLR Agonists in A549 Lung Epithelial Cells Is Modulated by CRISPR Activation of TLR10.', 'Research progress on Toll-like receptor signal transduction and its roles in antimicrobial immune responses.']"""

This study analyzes survival time from recurrence, patterns of progression, and the efficacy of salvage therapies in patients treated with radical or postoperative radiotherapy (RT).  Methods:   This is a multicenter retrospective comparative study of 1135 patients diagnosed with BF and treated with either radical (882) or postoperative (253) RT. Data correspond to the RECAP database. Clinical, tumor, and therapeutic characteristics were collected. Descriptive statistics, survival estimates, and comparisons of survival rates were calculated.  Results:   Time to BF from initial treatment (RT or surgery) was higher in irradiated patients (51 vs 37 months). At a median follow-up of 102 months (14-254), the 8-year cause-specific survival (CSS) was 80.5%, without significant differences between the radical (80.1%) and postoperative (83.4%) RT groups. The 8-year metastasis-free survival rate was 57%. 173 patients (15%) died of PCa and 29 (2.5%) of a second cancer. No salvage therapy was given in 15% of pts. Only 5.5% of pts who underwent radical RT had local salvage treatment and 71% received androgen deprivation (AD) ± chemotherapy. The worst outcomes were in patients who developed metastases after BF (302 pts; 26.5%) and in cases with a Gleason > 7.  Conclusions:   In PCa treated with radiotherapy, median survival after BF is relatively long. In this sample, no differences in survival rates at 8-years have been found, regardless of the time of radiotherapy administered. AD was the most common treatment after BF. Metastases and high Gleason score are adverse variables. To our knowledge, this is the first study to compare outcomes after BF among patients treated with primary RT vs. those treated with postoperative RT and to evaluate recurrence patterns, treatments administered, and causes of death. The results allow avoiding overtreatment, improving quality of life, without negatively affecting survival.""","""['C González-San Segundo', 'J Jové', 'A Zapatero', 'J Pastor-Peidro', 'M L Vázquez', 'M Casaña', 'J L Mengual', 'A Gómez-Caamaño', 'A Gómez-Iturriaga', 'C Vallejo', 'I Henríquez', 'J L Muñoz-García', 'J Clemente', 'M Porras', 'E Collado', 'G Ossola', 'E Villafranca', 'M A Cabeza', 'J López-Torrecilla']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Clin Transl Oncol""","""['Adjuvant versus salvage radiotherapy in prostate cancer: multi-institutional retrospective analysis of the Spanish RECAP database.', 'Impact of biochemical failure on overall survival after radiation therapy for localized prostate cancer in the PSA era.', 'Outcomes and prognostic factors in intermediate-risk prostate cancer: multi-institutional analysis of the Spanish RECAP database.', 'A systematic overview of radiation therapy effects in prostate cancer.', 'Salvage radiotherapy for palpable, locally recurrent prostate cancer after radical prostatectomy.', 'H19-Dependent Transcriptional Regulation of β3 and β4 Integrins Upon Estrogen and Hypoxia Favors Metastatic Potential in Prostate Cancer.']"""

Accurate localisation of disease in this setting may allow treatment modification and improved outcomes, especially in patients with pelvis-confined or extra-pelvic oligometastasis (defined as up to three pelvic nodal or distant sites). We aimed to measure the detection rate of [68]Ga-PSMA-HBNED-CC (PSMA)-PET/CT and its influence on patient management in eBCR of prostate cancer following radical prostatectomy (RP).  Methods:   We retrospectively identified 28 patients who underwent PSMA-PET/CT for post-RP eBCR (PSA < 0.5 ng/ml) at our tertiary care cancer centre. Two nuclear medicine physicians independently recorded the sites of PSMA-PET/CT positivity. Multidisciplinary meeting records were accessed to determine changes in management decisions following PSMA-PET/CT scans.  Results:   The mean age of patients was 65.6 years (range: 50-76.2 years); median PSA was 0.22 ng/ml (interquartile range: 0.15 ng/ml to 0.34 ng/ml). Thirteen patients (46.4%) had received radiotherapy in the past. PSMA-PET/CT was positive in 17 patients (60.7%). Only one patient had polymetastasis (> 3 sites); the remainder either had prostatectomy bed recurrence (n = 2), pelvic oligometastasis (n = 10), or extra-pelvic oligometastasis (n = 4). PSMA-PET/CT resulted in management change in 12 patients (42.8%), involving stereotactic body radiotherapy (n = 6), salvage radiotherapy (n = 4), and systemic treatment (n = 2).  Conclusions:   Our findings show that PSMA-PET/CT has a high detection rate in the eBCR setting following RP, with a large proportion of patients found to have fewer than three lesions. PSMA-PET/CT may be of value in patients with early PSA failure, and impact on the choice of potentially curative salvage treatments.""","""['Usman Bashir', 'Alison Tree', 'Erik Mayer', 'Daniel Levine', 'Chris Parker', 'David Dearnaley', 'Wim J G Oyen']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Eur J Nucl Med Mol Imaging""","""['68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT in prostate cancer patients with biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy and PSA <0.5\xa0ng/ml.

This challenge can be overcome by mechanochemical disruption of cancer cells via focused ultrasound (FUS) and sensitizing chemical agents such as ethanol. We demonstrate that this disruptive therapy decreases the viability, proliferation rate, tumorigenicity, endothelial adhesion, and migratory ability of prostate cancer cells in vitro. It sensitized the cells to TNFR1-- and Fas--mediated apoptosis and reduced the expression of metastatic markers CD44 and CD29. Using a prostate cancer xenograft model, we observed that the mechanochemical disruption led to complete tumor regression in vivo. This switch to a nonaggressive cell phenotype was caused by ROS and Hsp70 overproduction and subsequent impairment of NFκB signaling. FUS induces mechanical perturbations of diverse cancer cell populations, and its combination with agents that amplify and guide remedial cellular responses can stop lethal cancer progression.

Both pathologies may coexist and share numerous similarities, which have suggested several connections or some interplay between them. However, solid evidence confirming their existence is lacking. Recent studies on extensive series of prostatectomy specimens have shown that tumors originating in larger prostates present favorable pathological features. Hence, large prostates may exert a protective effect against prostate cancer. In this work, we propose a mechanical explanation for this phenomenon. The mechanical stress fields that originate as tumors enlarge have been shown to slow down their dynamics. Benign prostatic hyperplasia contributes to these mechanical stress fields, hence further restraining prostate cancer growth. We derived a tissue-scale, patient-specific mechanically coupled mathematical model to qualitatively investigate the mechanical interaction of prostate cancer and benign prostatic hyperplasia. This model was calibrated by studying the deformation caused by each disease independently. Our simulations show that a history of benign prostatic hyperplasia creates mechanical stress fields in the prostate that impede prostatic tumor growth and limit its invasiveness.

We aimed to assess the efficacy of lung resection in patients with isolated pulmonary recurrence after radical prostatectomy (RP) for clinically localized PC. Overall, nine patients with biochemical recurrence after RP and either single (n=4) or multiple (n=5) pulmonary uptake spots on fluorodeoxyglugose, choline, or prostate-specific membrane antigen positron emission tomography/computed tomography underwent a total of 20 lung resections between 2011 and 2017 at our institution. No postoperative complications occurred. After lung resection, seven of the nine patients experienced a biochemical response (defined as prostate-specific antigen <0.2ng/ml at 40d after surgery). All patients except for one were free of clinical recurrence (CR) at median follow-up of 23mo. One patient experienced CR and received androgen deprivation therapy at the time of bone recurrence. Although larger prospective studies are needed, our series demonstrates that surgical resection of isolated pulmonary metastases is safe and effective in selected PC patients with recurrent disease.""","""['Paola Ciriaco', 'Alberto Briganti', 'Annalisa Bernabei', 'Giorgio Gandaglia', 'Angelo Carretta', 'Cristina Viola', 'Francesco Montorsi', 'Giampiero Negri']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Eur Urol""","""['Efficacy, Predictive Factors, and Prediction Nomograms for 68Ga-labeled Prostate-specific Membrane Antigen-ligand Positron-emission Tomography/Computed Tomography in Early Biochemical Recurrent Prostate Cancer After Radical Prostatectomy.', 'Identification of Recurrence Sites Following Post-Prostatectomy Treatment for Prostate Cancer Using 11C-Choline Positron Emission Tomography and Multiparametric Pelvic Magnetic Resonance Imaging.', 'Does Choline PET/CT Change the Management of Prostate Cancer Patients With Biochemical Failure?', 'The Role of Prostate-specific Antigen Persistence After Radical Prostatectomy for the Prediction of Clinical Progression and Cancer-specific Mortality in Node-positive Prostate Cancer Patients.', 'Natural History of Clinical Recurrence Patterns of Lymph Node-Positive Prostate Cancer After Radical Prostatectomy.', 'Salvage therapy for prostate cancer after radical prostatectomy.', 'Radiographic and metabolic evolution of prostate cancer lung metastasis detected by prostate-specific membrane antigen and fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography.', 'Comprehensive analysis of in-hospital delirium after major surgical oncology procedures: A population-based study.']"""

Our objectives were, first, to study the clinical validity of the CAPRA score, and, second, to assess its clinical utility for stratified medicine from an original patient-centered approach.  Methods:   We proposed a meta-analysis based on a literature search using MEDLINE. Observed and predicted biochemical-recurrence-free survivals were compared to assess the calibration of the CAPRA score. Discriminative capacities were evaluated by estimating the summary time-dependent ROC curve. The clinical utility of the CAPRA score was evaluated according to the following stratified decisions: active monitoring for low-risk patients, prostatectomy for intermediate-risk patients, or radio-hormonal therapy for high risk patients. For this purpose, we assessed CAPRA's clinical utility in terms of its ability to maximize time-dependent utility functions (i.e. Quality-Adjusted Life-Years - QALYs).  Results:   We identified 683 manuscripts and finally retained 9 studies. We reported good discriminative capacities with an area under the SROCt curve at 0.73 [95%CI from 0.67 to 0.79], while graphical calibration seemed acceptable. Nevertheless, we also described that the CAPRA score was unable to discriminate between the three medical alternatives, i.e. it did not allow an increase in the number of life years in perfect health (QALYs) of patients with prostate cancer.  Conclusions:   We confirmed the prognostic capacities of the CAPRA score. In contrast, we were not able to demonstrate its clinical usefulness for stratified medicine from a patient-centered perspective. Our results also highlighted the confusion between clinical validity and utility.

Israel's highly developed healthcare system and mandatory National Health Insurance afforded an opportunity to study geographic variation over time in mortality following cancer diagnosis.  Methods:   This historical prospective cohort study included a nationally representative cohort that was assessed by the Israeli Central Bureau of Statistics 1995 census and followed until 2011. The cancer incidence (1995-2009) was ascertained by the Israel National Cancer Registry. We analyzed the effect on patient outcome of living in a given district, according to the Israeli Central Bureau of Statistics classification. Patients were stratified by the year of diagnosis (1995-1997, 1998-2000, etc.), and associations were adjusted for age, ethnicity, and districts. We excluded patients with malignancies associated with screening program (breast, prostate, colon, and cervical cancers).  Results:   This study included 26,173 patients living in 13 residential districts. During the last years (2007-2009) of the study, the hazard ratio (HR) for risk of death was high in 8/13 districts (61.5%), compared to 4/13 (30.7%) during 2004-2006, and 0/13 (0%) during 2001-2003. Districts that were less likely to be associated with increased risk of death were located in the center of Israel and in metropolitan areas, compared to the peripheral regions. Furthermore, HRs were substantially higher in the last years of the study (2007-2009, HRs rose to 1.69, 95%CI: 1.38-2.08) compared to the earlier years (2004-2006, HRs rose to 1.35, 95%CI: 1.13-1.62).

Classification is used to both predict clinical outcome and to inform initial management. However, significant heterogeneity is observed in outcome, particularly within the intermediate risk group, and there is an urgent need for additional markers to more accurately hone risk prediction. Recently developed web-based visualization and analysis tools have facilitated rapid interrogation of large transcriptome datasets, and querying broadly across multiple large datasets should identify predictors that are widely applicable.  Methods:   We used camcAPP, cBioPortal, CRN, and NIH NCI GDC Data Portal to data mine publicly available large prostate cancer datasets. A test set of biomarkers was developed by identifying transcripts that had: 1) altered abundance in prostate cancer, 2) altered expression in patients with Gleason score 7 tumours and biochemical recurrence, 3) correlation of expression with time until biochemical recurrence across three datasets (Cambridge, Stockholm, MSKCC). Transcripts that met these criteria were then examined in a validation dataset (TCGA-PRAD) using univariate and multivariable models to predict biochemical recurrence in patients with Gleason score 7 tumours.  Results:   Twenty transcripts met the test criteria, and 12 were validated in TCGA-PRAD Gleason score 7 patients. Ten of these transcripts remained prognostic in Gleason score 3 + 4 = 7, a sub-group of Gleason score 7 patients typically considered at a lower risk for poor outcome and often not targeted for aggressive management. All transcripts positively associated with recurrence encode or regulate mitosis and cell cycle-related proteins. The top performer was BUB1, one of four key MIR145-3P microRNA targets upregulated in hormone-sensitive as well as castration-resistant PCa. SRD5A2 converts testosterone to its more active form and was negatively associated with biochemical recurrence.  Conclusions:   Unbiased mining of large patient datasets identified 12 transcripts that independently predicted disease recurrence risk in Gleason score 7 prostate cancer. The mitosis and cell cycle proteins identified are also implicated in progression to castration-resistant prostate cancer, revealing a pivotal role for loss of cell cycle control in the latter.""","""['Wendy L Johnston', 'Charles N Catton', 'Carol J Swallow']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""BMC Urol""","""['Prostate-specific antigen level, stage or Gleason score: which is best for predicting outcomes after radical prostatectomy, and does it vary by the outcome being measured?

The role of HMT gene variants in prostate cancer remains unknown. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate HMT gene variants in the pathogenesis and prognosis of human prostate cancer, using in vitro cell studies and bioinformatics analysis. MATERIAL AND METHODS Integrative bioinformatics analysis of the expression of 51 HMT genes in human prostate cancer was based on datasets from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Correlation and regression analysis were used to identify critical HMTs in prostate cancer. Kaplan-Meier and the area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUROC) were performed to evaluate the function of the HMTs on prognosis. Gene expression and function of 22Rv1 human prostate carcinoma cells were studied. RESULTS The HMT genes identified to have a role in the pathogenesis of prostate cancer included the EZH2, SETD5, PRDM12, NSD1, SETD6, SMYD1, and the WHSC1L1 gene. The EZH2, SETD5, and SMYD1 genes were selected as a prognostic panel, with the SUV420H2 HMT gene. SETD2, NSD1, and ASH1L were identified as critical genes in the development of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), similar to mixed-lineage leukemia (MLL) complex family members. Knockdown of the SETD5 gene in 22Rv1 prostate carcinoma cells in vitro inhibited cancer cell growth and migration. CONCLUSIONS HMT gene variants may have a role in the pathogenesis of prostate cancer.

To improve the solubility of carvacrol, the formation of inclusion complexes with β-cyclodextrin was performed by ultrasound and freeze-drying methods and characterized using thermal analysis, FTIR, XRD, SEM, NMR and HPLC analysis. From these results, carvacrol was successfully complexed within β-cyclodextrin cavity. Moreover, HPLC analysis demonstrated a higher entrapment efficiency for freeze-drying method (81.20 ± 0.52%) in contrast to ultrasound method (34.02 ± 0.67%). Hence, freeze-drying inclusion complex was evaluated for its antiproliferative effect and cytotoxicity against prostate cancer cell line (PC3) in vitro. Further, freeze-drying complex led to a dose-dependent inhibition in tumor cell growth in 2D and 3D cell culture systems. Altogether, the inclusion of carvacrol in β-cyclodextrin led to the formation of stable complexes with potent antiproliferative effects against PC3 cells, in vitro.

However resistance to the treatment occurs eventually. One possible reason is the occurrence of AR mutations that prevent inhibition of AR-mediated transactivation by antagonists. To offer in future more options to inhibit AR signaling, novel chemical lead structures for new AR antagonists would be beneficial. Here we analyzed structure-activity relationships of a battery of 36 non-steroidal structural variants of methyl anthranilate including 23 synthesized compounds. We identified structural requirements that lead to more potent AR antagonists. Specific compounds inhibit the transactivation of wild-type AR as well as AR mutants that render treatment resistance to hydroxyflutamide, bicalutamide and the second-generation AR antagonist enzalutamide. This suggests a distinct mode of inhibiting the AR compared to the clinically used compounds. Competition assays suggest binding of these compounds to the AR ligand binding domain and inhibit PCa cell proliferation. Moreover, active compounds induce cellular senescence despite inhibition of AR-mediated transactivation indicating a transactivation-independent AR-pathway. In line with this, fluorescence resonance after photobleaching (FRAP) - assays reveal higher mobility of the AR in the cell nuclei.

To date, there is no clinical technique allowing for real-time assessment of surgical margins to minimize the extent of residual cancer. Here, we present a tissue interrogation technique using a dual excitation wavelength Raman spectroscopy system capable of sequentially acquiring fingerprint (FP) and high wavenumber (HWN) Raman spectra. Results demonstrate the ability of the system to detect PCa in post-prostatectomy specimens. In total, 477 Raman spectra were collected from 18 human prostate slices. Each area measured with Raman spectroscopy was characterized as either normal or cancer based on histopathological analyses, and each spectrum was classified based on supervised learning using support vector machines (SVMs). Based on receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, FP (area under the curve [AUC] = 0.89) had slightly superior cancer detection capabilities compared with HWN (AUC = 0.86). Optimal performance resulted from combining the spectral information from FP and HWN (AUC = 0.91), suggesting that the use of these two spectral regions may provide complementary molecular information for PCa detection. The use of leave-one-(spectrum)-out (LOO) or leave-one-patient-out (LOPO) cross-validation produced similar classification results when combining FP with HWN. Our findings suggest that the application of machine learning using multiple data points from the same patient does not result in biases necessarily impacting the reliability of the classification models.""","""['Kelly Aubertin', 'Joannie Desroches', 'Michael Jermyn', 'Vincent Quoc Trinh', 'Fred Saad', 'Dominique Trudel', 'Frédéric Leblond']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Biomed Opt Express""","""['Mesoscopic characterization of prostate cancer using Raman spectroscopy: potential for diagnostics and therapeutics.', 'Real-time In vivo Diagnosis of Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma Using Rapid Fiber-Optic Raman Spectroscopy.', 'Simultaneous fingerprint and high-wavenumber confocal Raman spectroscopy enhances early detection of cervical precancer in vivo.', 'Multiparametric MRI in detection and staging of prostate cancer.', 'Translational Metabolomics of Head Injury: Exploring Dysfunctional Cerebral Metabolism with Ex Vivo NMR Spectroscopy-Based Metabolite Quantification.', 'Preclinical evaluation of Raman spectroscopy for pedicular screw insertion surgical guidance in a porcine spine model.', 'In situ Raman spectroscopy and machine learning unveil biomolecular alterations in invasive breast cancer.', 'Image-guided Raman spectroscopy navigation system to improve transperineal prostate cancer detection.

But how maternal and post-weaning HFD may influence the tumorigenesis of prostate cancer (PCa) in male offspring has not yet been reported.  Methods:   We studied both solitary and combined effects of maternal or/and post-weaning HFD on the tumorigenesis of prostate in offspring using a transgenic adenocarcinoma of mouse prostate (TRAMP) model. TRAMP male mice (n = 24) were born to and fostered onto control diet or HFD-fed mothers, the weaned pups were further fed control or fat diet. All mice were sacrificed at the 28th week. The prostate histopathology was performed. The gut microbiota was analyzed by fecal 16S rRNA pyrosequencing, and the serum metabolites were determined by LC-MS/MS.  Results:   Our results indicated that post-weaning HFD could significantly promote the PCa tumorigenesis in offspring (P = 0.031), and similar results were found in maternal HFD group but with no significant differences (P = 0.056). However, combined maternal and post-weaning HFD could significantly reduce the PCa tumorigenesis in offspring (P = 0.019). Significant differences in specific microbial populations and serum metabolites were observed across groups. For example, mice with combined maternal and post-weaning HFD had higher abundance of gut Lachonospiraceae, Roseburia, and Amycolatopsis, increased serum L-methionine (P = 0.0052), and decreased serum α-linolenic acid (P < 0.001).

Methods:   Eighty-eight mCRPC patients were identified (42 in the DP-to-AA group and 46 in the AA-to-DP group). The serum levels of NED markers were measured before the first-line treatment in 88 patients and also before and after DP therapy in 38 patients. We determined their impact on OS, radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS), and PSA-PFS.  Results:   In men with an elevation of at least one NED marker (n = 46) before the first-line treatment, those who received AA and then DP had significantly better worse OS (21.7 months [95% CI 21.0-22.4] vs 19.9 months (95% CI 15.3-24.5); P = 0.023.

However, in the subgroup without NED marker elevation, there was no significant difference in clinical outcomes between AA-DP and DP-AA groups (all P > 0.05). In the group with continued NED marker evaluation during DP treatment, patients with higher baseline NED markers and obtaining PSA response to DP were more inclined to experience NED markers decline.  Conclusions:   Elevated pretreatment serum NED markers might indicate mCRPC patients would get better clinical outcomes from DP-AA than AA-DP. In contrast, those without NED marker elevation had similar outcomes regardless of which agent was chosen first. mCRPC patients with elevated NED markers and chemotherapy response were more inclined to obtain NED markers decline during DP therapy, which could account for this phenomenon.""","""['Liancheng Fan', 'Yan Yang', 'Chenfei Chi', 'Xiaowei Ma', 'Rui Wang', 'Yiming Gong', 'Hongying Zheng', 'Jiahua Pan', 'Yinjie Zhu', 'Baijun Dong', 'Wei Xue']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Re: Neuroendocrine differentiation markers guide treatment sequence selection in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.

Disruption of normal HOX gene expression occurs frequently in human cancers and is associated with both tumor promoting and suppressing activities. Among these is, HOXA10, a pleiotropic gene that is critical for normal prostate development. In this study we characterized HOXA10 expression in human and mouse PCa to gain insights into its clinical significance.  Methods:   A meta-analysis of HOXA10 mRNA expression was carried out across several publicly available data sets. Expression of HOXA10 protein expression was assessed by immunohistochemistry (IHC) using human radical prostatectomy (RP) cases. We correlated HOXA10 expression to clinicopathological features and investigated its relationship to biochemical recurrence (BCR) after RP by the Kaplan-Meier method. HOXA10 mRNA and IHC protein expression was also examined in a mouse model of Pten-null PCa.  Results:   A meta-analysis of HOXA10 gene expression indicated dysregulated expression of HOXA10 in human PCa. IHC profiling of HOXA10 revealed inverse correlations between HOXA10 expression and Gleason pattern, Gleason score, and pathological stage (P < 0.01). Patients with low expression profiles of HOXA10 were associated with a higher risk of BCR, (OR, 3.54; 95%CI, 1.21-16.14; P = 0.049) whereas patients with high HOXA10 expression experienced longer times to BCR (P = 0.045). However, HOXA10 was not an independent predictor of BCR (OR, 1.52; 95%CI, 0.42-5.54; P = 0.52). Evaluation of expression patterns of HOXA10 in mouse prostate tumors mimicked that of humans.  Conclusions:   Our findings show that HOXA10 expression is inversely associated with tumor differentiation and high HOXA10 expression is associated with improved BCR-free survival.

Following that, the PCa PC-3 cell line was adopted for subsequently experiments, in which the expression of LEF1-AS1 and miR-330-5p was subsequently altered by means of exogenous transfection. After that, the effects of up- or downregulation of LEF1-AS1 and miR-330-5p on epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and the cell ability for proliferation, invasion, migration in vitro, and tumorigenesis and lymph node metastasis (LNM) in vivo were evaluated.

Prostate cancer visualization could be improved by combining the complementary modalities of immuno-positron emission tomography (immunoPET) for preoperative disease detection, and fluorescence imaging-guided surgery (FIGS) for real-time intraoperative tumor margin identification. Here, we report on the evaluation of dual-labeled humanized anti-prostate stem cell antigen (PSCA) cys-minibody (A11 cMb) for immunoPET/fluorescence imaging in subcutaneous and orthotopic prostate cancer models. Methods: A11 cMb was site-specifically conjugated with the near-infrared fluorophore Cy5.5 and radiolabeled with 124I or 89Zr. 124I-A11 cMb-Cy5.5 was used for successive immunoPET/fluorescence imaging of prostate cancer xenografts expressing high or moderate levels of PSCA (22Rv1-PSCA and PC3-PSCA). 89Zr-A11 cMb-Cy5.5 dual-modality imaging was evaluated in an orthotopic model. Ex vivo biodistribution at 24 h was used to confirm the uptake values, and tumors were visualized by post-mortem fluorescence imaging. Results: A11 cMb-Cy5.5 retained low nanomolar affinity for PSCA-positive cells. Conjugation conditions were established (dye-to-protein ratio of 0.7:1) that did not affect the biodistribution, pharmacokinetics, or clearance of A11 cMb. ImmunoPET using dual-labeled 124I-A11 cMb-Cy5.5 showed specific targeting to both 22Rv1-PSCA and PC3-PSCA s.c. xenografts in nude mice. Ex vivo biodistribution confirmed specific uptake to PSCA-expressing tumors with 22Rv1-PSCA:22Rv1 and PC3-PSCA:PC3 ratios of 13:1 and 5.6:1, respectively. Consistent with the immunoPET, fluorescence imaging showed a strong signal from both 22Rv1-PSCA and PC3-PSCA tumors compared with non-PSCA expressing tumors. In an orthotopic model, 89Zr-A11 cMb-Cy5.5 immunoPET was able to detect intraprostatically implanted 22Rv1-PSCA cells. Importantly, fluorescence imaging clearly distinguished the prostate tumor from surrounding seminal vesicles. Conclusion: Dual-labeled A11 cMb specifically visualized PSCA-positive tumor by successive immunoPET/fluorescence, which can potentially be translated for preoperative whole-body prostate cancer detection and intraoperative surgical guidance in patients.""","""['Wenting K Tsai', 'Kirstin A Zettlitz', 'Richard Tavaré', 'Naoko Kobayashi', 'Robert E Reiter', 'Anna M Wu']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Theranostics""","""['Quantitative immunoPET of prostate cancer xenografts with 89Zr- and 124I-labeled anti-PSCA A11 minibody.', 'Applications of immunoPET: using 124I-anti-PSCA A11 minibody for imaging disease progression and response to therapy in mouse xenograft models of prostate cancer.', 'A Dual-Modality Linker Enables Site-Specific Conjugation of Antibody Fragments for 18F-Immuno-PET and Fluorescence Imaging.', '124I-Labeled anti-prostate stem cell antigen affinity-matured A11 minibody.', '124I-Anti-PSCA 2B3 minibody.', 'The Identification of CELSR3 and Other Potential Cell Surface Targets in Neuroendocrine Prostate Cancer.', 'PSMA-Targeted Nanotheranostics for Imaging and Radiotherapy of Prostate Cancer.', 'In vivo evaluation of integrin αvβ6-targeting peptide in NSCLC and brain metastasis.', 'Noncanonical amino acids as doubly bio-orthogonal handles for one-pot preparation of protein multiconjugates.', 'Development of a multi faceted platform containing a tetrazine, fluorophore and chelator: synthesis, characterization, radiolabeling, and immuno-SPECT imaging.']"""

Many studies have shown that the levels of folic acid (FA) receptor on the surface of various tumor cells are high. Therefore, FA-modified NPs-CTX may have enhanced antitumor effects compared with unmodified NPs-CTX.  Methods:   NPs-CTX were first prepared via self-assembly, and FA was conjugated on the surface of NPs-CTX through the -NH2 groups of the NPs to produce FA-NPs-CTX. The FA-NPs-CTX were evaluated in tumor cells with high FA receptor (FR) expression in vitro and in vivo.  Results:   Both NPs-CTX and FA-NPs-CTX exhibited good stability and morphology. Drug release from the NPs was not affected by FA conjugation. Compared with CTX dissolved in a mixture of Tween 80 and 13% ethanol (w/w) at a ratio of 1:4 (v/v) (Tween-CTX), the two nanoformulations had lower lytic activity against normal red blood cells. However, FA-NPs-CTX showed greater inhibition of tumor cells with overexpressed FR, compared with NPs-CTX, in the cytotoxicity experiments. Moreover, the cellular uptake of FA-NPs-CTX was enhanced through FR-mediated endocytosis in HeLa cells in vitro and HeLa xenograft tumors in vivo. Although Tween-CTX exhibited tumor growth inhibition similar to FA-NPs-CTX in vivo, this inhibition also caused adverse side effects; the median lethal dose (LD50) of Tween-CTX to mice was 5.68 mg/kg, while FA-NPs-CTX-treated mice survived at doses exceeding 400 mg/kg.  Conclusion:   The results showed that FA-NPs-CTX caused inhibition of tumor growth in a manner similar to that of Tween-CTX; however, the safety and tolerability of CTX were greatly improved by FA conjugation compared with those of Tween-CTX. In summary, FA-NPs-CTX have great potential in CTX delivery, and this formulation is a promising candidate for the treatment of cancers with high FR levels.""","""['Yating Sun', 'Yarong Zhao', 'Shanshan Teng', 'Fei Hao', 'Huan Zhang', 'Fanchao Meng', 'Xiuting Zhao', 'Xiaolong Zheng', 'Ye Bi', 'Yicheng Yao', 'Robert J Lee', 'Lesheng Teng']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Int J Nanomedicine""","""['Low density lipoprotein mimic nanoparticles composed of amphipathic hybrid peptides and lipids for tumor-targeted delivery of paclitaxel.', 'A Novel Folic Acid Receptor-Targeted Drug Delivery System Based on Curcumin-Loaded β-Cyclodextrin Nanoparticles for Cancer Treatment.', 'Lipoprotein-Inspired Nanocarrier Composed of Folic Acid\ufeff-Modified Protein and Lipids: Preparation and Evaluation of Tumor\ufeff-Targeting Effect.', 'Folic acid-modified ginsenoside Rg5-loaded bovine serum albumin nanoparticles for targeted cancer therapy in vitro and in vivo.', 'pH-sensitive Au-BSA-DOX-FA nanocomposites for combined CT imaging and targeted drug delivery.', 'Effective Triple-Negative Breast Cancer Targeted Treatment Using iRGD-Modified RBC Membrane-Camouflaged Nanoparticles.', 'Combination Therapy of Metastatic Castration-Recurrent Prostate Cancer: Hyaluronic Acid Decorated, Cabazitaxel-Prodrug and Orlistat Co-Loaded Nano-System.', 'A Smart Multifunctional Nanoparticle for Enhanced Near-Infrared Image-Guided Photothermal Therapy Against Gastric Cancer.', 'Recent trends in protein and peptide-based biomaterials for advanced drug delivery.', 'Nanoparticle-Based Drug Delivery System: A Patient-Friendly Chemotherapy for Oncology.']"""

Methods and materials:   US radiation oncology residents in the Association of Residents in Radiation Oncology database were sent an online questionnaire regarding brachytherapy training. Survey questions addressed a wide array of topics, and responses were often given on a 1 to 5 Likert-type scale that reflected strength of opinion. Postgraduate year (PGY) 4/5 respondents' answers were analyzed. Descriptive statistics were generated, and rank correlation analyses (Kendall's τ coefficient and Wilcoxon signed-rank test) were used for comparisons.  Results:   The survey was completed by 145 of 567 residents (62% being PGY4/5). Of PGY4/5 respondents, 96% (86 of 90) believed learning brachytherapy during residency was important, and 72% (65 of 90) felt their program valued brachytherapy training. Resident brachytherapy comfort varied by site, decreasing as follows: gynecologic, prostate, breast, skin. The current intracavitary 15-case minimum was believed adequate by most, but only a minority believed the 5-case interstitial minimum was adequate. Most respondents (59%) believed that caseload was the greatest barrier to achieving independence in brachytherapy. Significant support exists for American Brachytherapy Society training courses and on-the-job education to enhance training, but enthusiasm about pursuing brachytherapy fellowship training was low. Most respondents expressed confidence in developing a brachytherapy practice (54%); however, this was significantly lower than the rate of those confident in developing a stereotactic body radiation therapy/stereotactic radiosurgery program (97%) (P < .001). Furthermore, there was an association between aggregate number of brachytherapy cases performed and resident confidence in starting a brachytherapy practice (τ = 0.37; P < .001).  Conclusions:   Brachytherapy is an important component of residency training that is valued by residents and programs. Because caseload was the greatest perceived barrier in brachytherapy training, with confidence correlated with case volume, attempts should be made to expand opportunities for training experiences that are feasible to complete during residency.""","""['Samuel R Marcrom', 'Jenna M Kahn', 'Lauren E Colbert', 'Christopher M Freese', 'Kaleigh N Doke', 'Joanna C Yang', 'Catheryn M Yashar', 'Michael Luu', 'Mitchell Kamrava']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys""","""['In Regard to Marcrom et\xa0al.', 'Results of the 2005-2008 Association of Residents in Radiation Oncology survey of chief residents in the United States: clinical training and resident working conditions.', 'Results of the 2013-2015 Association of Residents in Radiation Oncology Survey of Chief Residents in the United States.', 'Fellowship Training Programs in Radiation Oncology: A Snapshot From 2005 to 2017.', 'More than learning technical skills: The importance of mentorship and coaching during a brachytherapy fellowship.', 'Education in gynecological brachytherapy.', 'Survey on brachytherapy training among radiation oncology residents in the German-speaking regions of Europe.', 'Investigation of standardized training of radiation oncology residents for gynaecological tumours in China.', 'Resident training in brachytherapy in France: A 10-year update after the first survey of SFJRO members.', 'AAPM BTSC Report 377: Physicist Brachytherapy Training in 2021-A survey of therapeutic medical physics residency program directors.', 'Survey of brachytherapy training experience among radiation oncology trainees and fellows in the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Radiologists (RANZCR).']"""

Diabetic patients with prostate cancer could be at a high risk of radiation-induced acute proctitis following radical radiotherapy. Our aims were to analyse the incidence, severity, and duration of radiation proctitis in diabetic patients treated by radical radiotherapy and combined androgen deprivation for prostate cancer.  Material and methods:   On the bases of inclusion and exclusion criteria 716 patients with prostate cancer were retrospectively recruited. Patients were stratified into diabetic patients and non-diabetic patients. The incidence, severity, and duration of proctitis were the main outcomes. A polynomial ordered logistic regression was fitted to determine the influence of diabetes status, age, blood pressures medication, co-morbidities, Gleason score, PSA after treatment, and tumour stage on the grades of proctitis. Time to resolution per year was modelled as a negative binomial generalised linear model.  Results:   The overall mean age of patients was 67.44 (SD 6.77) years with a follow-up time of 3.36 (SD 2.05) years. Data exploratory analysis suggested that the only highly significant explanatory variable was the presence or absence of diabetes. Polynomial ordered logistic regression, however, showed that the presence (or not) of diabetes remained as the only significant predictor (t = -2.74; p = 0.0059) of severity of proctitis. A negative binomial generalised linear model showed that both grade of proctitis (z = -17.178; p < 0.001), and diabetes (z = -5.92; p < 0.001), were highly significant predictors of time to resolution.  Conclusions:   Diabetic patients were significantly more likely to have proctitis after radical radiation therapy for prostate cancer.

More than one-third of patients with this histology die within a year of the initial diagnosis of prostate cancer. We aimed to perform molecular profiling of these tumors to identify potential therapeutic targets.  Methods and results:   Here, we performed next-generation sequencing with a highly validated targeted panel (UW-OncoPlex) on somatic tumour DNA extracted from eight cases of prostatic adenocarcinoma with focal pleomorphic giant-cell features, including cases with and without prior treatment for prostate cancer. We found that DNA damage repair mutations are common in this rare subset of prostate tumours, with two of eight having bi-allelic pathogenic mutations in homologous DNA repair genes (including BRCA2 and NBN) and two of eight having bi-allelic pathogenic mutations in mismatch repair genes (including MSH2 and MLH1).  Conclusion:   These data are consistent with emerging data showing that DNA repair alterations are enriched among castration-resistant prostate cancer and aggressive subsets of primary tumours. Given that these patients are potential candidates for poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitor and/or immune checkpoint blockade, and have a poor prognosis with standard therapy, we recommend that tumour and germline DNA sequencing with or without mismatch repair protein immunohistochemistry be considered for all prostatic adenocarcinomas with focal pleomorphic giant-cell features.""","""['Tamara L Lotan', 'Harsimar B Kaur', 'Abdullah M Alharbi', 'Colin C Pritchard', 'Jonathan I Epstein']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Histopathology""","""['Prostatic Adenocarcinoma With Focal Pleomorphic Giant Cell Features: A Series of 30 Cases.', 'Mismatch repair deficiency may be common in ductal adenocarcinoma of the prostate.', 'Treatment strategies for DNA repair-deficient prostate cancer.', 'Frequent mismatch-repair defects link prostate cancer to Lynch syndrome.', 'DNA repair defects in prostate cancer: impact for screening, prognostication and treatment.', 'Pleomorphic giant cell carcinoma of the prostate: clinicopathologic analysis and oncological outcomes.', 'Cell-Free DNA Sequencing Reveals Gene Variants in DNA Damage Repair Genes Associated with Prognosis of Prostate Cancer Patients.', 'Cellular and Molecular Mechanisms Underlying Prostate Cancer Development: Therapeutic Implications.']"""

Methods:   We performed a retrospective analysis of 146 consecutive patients with suspected PCa based on symptoms or elevated total prostate-specific antigen (tPSA) levels who underwent 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT and histopathologic examinations from April 2017 to April 2018 in a large tertiary care hospital in China. The 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT results (PCa or benignancy) were evaluated by two experienced nuclear medicine specialists. The risk of positive PCa was evaluated using ERSPC and PCPT nomograms. The diagnostic performances of 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT and that of the two nomograms were compared via receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, decision curve analysis, and logistic regression.  Results:   A total of 58 patients with tPSA of 0.4-50 ng/ml were included in the final analysis; PCa diagnosis was confirmed in 37 patients and excluded in 21 patients.

The net benefit of 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT was greatest for patients within threshold probabilities of 15-90%. Among the 58 patients, 11 (19%) biopsies suggested by ERSPC-RC3 were unnecessary and could have been avoided if judged by the 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT results.

Materials and methods:   423 men aged ≤60 years with clinically localized PCa were treated with BT ± external beam radiation. Biochemical failure was defined by Phoenix criteria. Freedom from biochemical failure (FFbF) and cancer-specific survival (CSS) at 10 and 15 years were estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method with the log-rank test to compare outcomes between National Comprehensive Cancer Network risk groups. The Cox proportional hazards model was used to determine significant predictors for FFbF and CSS.  Results:   Median followup was 9.9 years (range, 5.1-21.7). Median age was 57 years (range, 39-60), and median prostate-specific antigen was 6.1 ng/mL (range, 0.8-71). Overall, 10- and 15-year FFbF rates were 89% and 88%; 10- and 15-year CSS rates were 99% and 98%. Increasing disease risk was associated with lower FFbF and CSS (p < 0.0001). Biologically effective dose (p < 0.0001) and use of external beam radiation (p = 0.005) were significantly associated with higher FFbF. In men potent before BT, 64% (151/237) had preserved erectile function at a median 10.2 years. There was no significant difference between treatment groups with respect to long-term urinary function (p = 0.56).

Murine cells often lack some of the receptors needed for hAds attachment, thus murine cells are generally non-permissive for human adenoviral infection and replication, which limits translational studies.  Methods:   We have developed a gene transfer method that uses a combination of lipid-encapsulated perfluorocarbon microbubbles and ultrasound to protect and deliver hAds to a target tissue, bypassing the requirement of specific receptors.  Results:   In an in vitro model, we showed that murine TRAMP-C2 and human DU145 prostate cancer cells display a comparable expression pattern of receptors involved in hAds adhesion and internalization. We also demonstrated that murine and human cells showed a dose-dependent increase in the percentage of cells transduced by hAd-GFP (green fluorescent protein) after 24 h and that GFP transgene was efficiently expressed at 48 and 72 h post-transduction. To assess if our image-guided delivery system could effectively protect the hAds from the immune system in vivo, we injected healthy immunocompetent mice (C57BL/6) or mice bearing a syngeneic prostate tumor (TRAMP-C2) with hAd-GFP/MB complexes. Notably, we did not observe activation of innate (TNF-α and IL-6 cytokines), or adaptive immune response (neutralizing antibodies, INF-γ+ CD8+ T cells).

PTBP3 expression in prostate cancer cell lines is found significantly higher compared to skin fibroblasts using real-time PCR (p < 0.05) and digital droplet PCR (p < 0.01). Exploration of the chromatin spatial architecture of a nearly 200-kb fragment of chromosome 9 encompassing the PTBP3 gene identified two elements located 63 kb upstream and 48 kb downstream of PTBP3, which looped specifically to the PTBP3 promoter. These elements contain histone acetylation patterns characteristic of open chromatin regions with active enhancers. Our results reveal for the first time that long-range chromatin interactions between the -63 kb and +48 kb loci and the PTBP3 promoter regulate the expression of this gene in prostate cancer cells.

We hypothesized that length of stay would be a function of time of surgery and would be a poorer marker of recovery than time of discharge.  Methods:   A cohort of 891 mastectomy and 538 prostatectomy patients had a planned single overnight stay after surgery at an ambulatory surgical hospital during 2016. The relationship between surgical start time and postoperative length of stay or discharge time was assessed.  Results:   For both mastectomy and prostatectomy patients, 75% of patients were discharged between 10 AM and 12 noon and the median postoperative length of stay was 20 hours. There was a strong association between time of surgery and calculated length of stay. For mastectomies, having a surgery which begins at 6 PM vs 8 AM results in an estimated decrease of 8.8 hours (95% CI, 8.3-9.3) in postoperative length of stay but only 1.2 hours (95% CI, 0.77-1.6) later time of discharge. For prostatectomies, the estimated difference is a decrease of 6.9 hours (95% CI, 6.4-7.4) for postoperative length of stay and 2.5 hours (95% CI, 2.0-3.0) later discharge time.  Conclusions:   Postoperative length of stay is a poor outcome measure in a short-stay setting. When assessing rapidity of recovery for single overnight stay patients, we advocate the use of discharge time with adjustment for surgery start time. The effect of surgery start time on both postoperative length of stay and discharge time should be investigated to ascertain which is best to assess rapidity of recovery in other ambulatory care settings where recovery involves a single overnight stay.""","""['Melissa J Assel', 'Vincent P Laudone', 'Rebecca S Twersky', 'Andrew J Vickers', 'Brett A Simon']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Anesth Analg""","""['Comparison of length of hospital stay between radical retropubic prostatectomy and robotic assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy.', 'Impact of caregiver overnight stay on postoperative outcomes.', 'Population-based study of relationships between hospital volume of prostatectomies, patient outcomes, and length of hospital stay.', 'Optimization of an early discharge program after laparoscopic radical prostatectomy.', 'Single-injection thoracic paravertebral block and postoperative analgesia after mastectomy: a retrospective cohort study.', ""Proportions of Surgical Patients Discharged Home the Same or the Next Day Are Sufficient Data to Assess Cases' Contributions to Hospital Occupancy."", 'Complex Cancer Surgery in the Outpatient Setting: The Josie Robertson Surgery Center.', 'Suitability of outpatient or ambulatory extended recovery cancer surgeries for obese patients.']"""

The aim of the current study was: to identify (1) incidence, demographics and survival of a population-based cohort of patients having surgery for MBDex (2) rate of referrals and referral pattern to a musculoskeletal tumour centre (MTC).  Material and method:   A prospective study of a consecutive population-based cohort of patients having surgery for MBDex from 2014 to 2016. Patient demographics, indication for surgery, oncological status, and postoperative survival was obtained from patient interviews, surveillance scans and patient records.  Results:   We identified 164 patients treated for 175 bone lesions resulting in an incidence of MBDex surgery of 48.6 lesions/million inhabitants/year and a 10% risk of undergoing surgery for MBDex for every year liven with metastatic bone disease. The most common primary cancers were breast, lung, renal, prostate and myeloma. Twenty-nine lesions represented debut of cancer and 22 lesions debut of relapse of a previous cancer. Overall one-year survival was 41% (95% C.I.: 33%-48%). Fifty-nine percent of patients were referred for treatment at MTC. Patients referred had better prognostic baseline characteristic than patients treated at secondary surgical centres (SSC) (lower ASA score (p < .001), no visceral metastasis (p < .001), lower age (p < .001) and less aggressive primary cancer (p < .001)). The one-year probability of overall survival was higher for MTC patients compared to SSC patients (p < .001).  Conclusions:   Present study describes a prospective population-based cohort of patients having surgery for MBDex identifying incidence and postoperative survival. Referral of patient is biased by selection where 'long-term survivors' are referred for treatment at MTC. We can, however, not exclude that treatment centre influences chance of survival after surgery for MBDex although our study was not designed to identify any potential influence.""","""['Michala Skovlund Sørensen', 'Klaus Hindsø', 'Peter Frederik Horstmann', 'Anders Troelsen', 'Stig Dalsgaard', 'Tobias Fog', 'Tomasz Zimnicki', 'Michael Mørk Petersen']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Acta Oncol""","""['External Validation and Optimization of the SPRING Model for Prediction of Survival After Surgical Treatment of Bone Metastases of the Extremities.', 'Prognostic value of biochemical variables for survival after surgery for metastatic bone disease of the extremities.', 'Treatment of pathologic fractures of the proximal femur.', 'Metastatic bone disease: A review of survival, prognostic factors and outcomes following surgical treatment of the appendicular skeleton.', 'Prognosis-adapted surgical management of bone metastases.', 'Fully constrained acetabular liner vs. dual mobility hip joint in the surgical treatment of metastatic bone disease of the hip: study protocol for a randomized, open-label, two-arm, non-inferiority trial evaluating the post-operative hip dislocation rate.', 'Dislocation rate after hip arthroplasty due to metastatic bone disease: a retrospective cohort study evaluating the postoperative dislocation risk across different articulating solutions.', 'Surgical Treatment of Metastatic Bone Disease in the Appendicular Skeleton: A Population-Based Study.', 'Pretreatment Plasma IL-6 and YKL-40 and Overall Survival after Surgery for Metastatic Bone Disease of the Extremities.', 'Surgical Treatment of Metastatic Bone Disease-When Decisions at End-of-Life Really Makes the Difference.']"""

This study aimed to evaluate the expression of UNC5D, a newly identified tumor suppressor gene, analyze its epigenetic alterations, and elucidate its functional relevance to PCa metastasis. Meta-analysis of publicly available microarray datasets revealed that UNC5D expression was frequently downregulated in PCa tissues and inversely associated with PCa metastasis. These results were verified in clinical specimens by real-time PCR and immunohistochemistry assays. Through methylation analysis, the downregulated expression of UNC5D in PCa tissues and cell lines was found to be attributable to the hypermethylation of the promoter. A negative correlation was observed between methylation and UNC5D mRNA expression in PCa samples. The ectopic expression of UNC5D in PCa cells effectively reduced their ability to migrate and invade both in vitro and in vivo, and siRNA-mediated knockdown of UNC5D yielded consistent results. UNC5D can recruit and activate death-associated protein kinase 1, which remained to be essential for its metastatic suppressor function.

Limited data exist on the management of symptomatic hemorrhoids in radiated patients. This study aims to present a practical approach to the management of radiation proctitis, particularly in patients with synchronous hemorrhoids.  Methods:   A total of 52 consecutive cases of radiation proctitis managed between September 1999 and October 2017 were retrospectively reviewed. The primary treatment was formalin application, plus rubber band ligation in conjunction with formalin when hemorrhoids were a significant component of bleeding, and occasionally argon plasma coagulation.  Results:   The primary indication for radiotherapy was for the treatment of prostate cancer (71%), anal squamous cell carcinoma (10%), and gynecological malignancies (18%). More than half of the patients (52%) presented with radiation proctitis and concomitant internal hemorrhoids. The hemorrhoids were managed with rubber band ligation (56%) and stapled hemorrhoidectomy (7%), at the same procedure as formalin application. At a median follow-up of 12 months, no recurrent rectal bleeding occurred, and no further treatment was needed for most patients. One patient experienced a short period of perianal pain, which was treated with analgesics.  Conclusion:   Formalin application has consistently demonstrated an excellent cure rate and safety profile comparable with the published results as a primary treatment for radiation proctitis. The prolapse of irradiated mucosa over the internal hemorrhoids appears to exacerbate bleeding. Local hemorrhoid treatment is often required as an adjunct in the management of these patients.""","""['M S De Robles', 'C J Young']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Scand J Surg""","""['Hemorrhoid management in patients with radiation proctitis.', 'Haemorrhagic radiation proctitis: endoscopic severity may be useful to guide therapy.', 'Argon plasma coagulation therapy versus topical formalin for intractable rectal bleeding and anorectal dysfunction after radiation therapy for prostate carcinoma.', 'Management of radiation proctitis.', 'Conservative therapies for hemorrhagic radiation proctitis: a review.', 'Effectiveness of Mayinglong Musk Hemorrhoid Ointment on Wound Healing and Complications after Internal Hemorrhoid Ligation and External Hemorrhoidectomy.', 'Rectal band ligation as a treatment for chronic radiation proctitis: a feasibility study.', 'A Ten-year-long Update on Radiation Proctitis Among Prostate Cancer Patients Treated With Curative External Beam Radiotherapy.']"""

The sensitivity of MDA-MB231 was in the same range than the hormone-dependent MCF-7 breast cancer, the PC-3 prostate and HT-29 colon cancer cells, while the A549 lung and the HeLa uterine cancer cells were less sensitive. We compared the inhibitory effects of Re-diSe and of its diselenide ligand (di-Se) on MDA-MB231 and a normal HEK-293 human embryonic cell line, after 72 h and 120 h of exposure.

The cytotoxic effects of Re-diSe were highly selective for cancer cells, with a significant increase of the number of dead cancer cells at 5 μM for an exposure time of 120 h, while normal cells were not affected.

This study assessed whether 11C-choline PET/CT predicts survival in PCa patients with PSA < 1 ng/ml.  Methods:   This retrospective study included 210 PCa patients treated with radical prostatectomy who underwent 11C-choline PET/CT from December 1, 2004 to July 31, 2007 due to biochemical failure. PCa-specific survival was estimated using Kaplan-Meier curves. Cox regression analysis was used to evaluate the association between clinicopathologic variables and PCa-specific survival. PCa-specific survival was computed as the interval from radical prostatectomy to PCa-specific death.  Results:   Median follow-up after radical prostatectomy was 6.9 years (95% confidence interval, CI, 2.0-14.5 years). 11C-choline PET/CT was positive in 20.5% of patients. Median PCa-specific survival was 13.4 years (95% CI, 9.9-16.8 years) in patients with positive 11C-choline PET/CT, and it was not achieved in patients with negative 11C-choline PET/CT (log-rank, chi-square = 15.0, P < 0.001). Ten-year survival probabilities for patients with negative 11C-choline PET/CT and for patients with positive 11C-choline PET/CT were 86.0% (95% CI: 80.7%-91.3%) and 63.6% (95% CI: 54.5-72.7%). At multivariate analysis, only 11C-choline PET/CT significantly predicted PCa-specific survival (hazard ratio = 2.54, 95% CI, 1.05-6.13, P = 0.038). Patients with pathological 11C-choline uptake in the prostatic bed or in pelvic lymph nodes had longer PCa-specific survival in comparison to patients with pathological tracer uptake in the skeleton (log-rank: chi-square = 27.4, P < 0.001).  Conclusion:   Despite the relatively low positive detection rate for PSA < 1 ng/ml, positive 11C-choline PET/CT predicts PCa-specific survival in this low PSA range.

Several studies have also reported cases of association between Schistosoma infection and prostate cancer. The possible causal association is however poorly understood. We hypothesized in this study that infection of the prostate cells with Schistosoma spp promotes cancer. Urine samples from individuals living in Galilea, a schistosomiasis endemic community in the Ga South District of Ghana, were collected and screened for Schistosoma infection via microscopy and multiplex PCR. Soluble egg antigens (SEA) were prepared from Schistosoma egg-positive urine samples and assessed for the ability to induce cancer-like phenotypes including excessive proliferation, oxidative stress (reduced glutathione (GSH) depletion), and diminished apoptosis in cultured human prostate (PNT2) cells. Molecular analysis revealed infecting schistosome species to be S. haematobium and S. mansoni. Prostate cell proliferation was significantly induced by 12.5 μg/ml SEA (p = 0.029). Also, SEA dose-dependently depleted cellular GSH. Flow cytometric analysis and fluorescence staining revealed that SEA dose-dependently diminished apoptosis, significantly, in prostate cells.

Important PCa radiotracers include 68Ga-prostate-specific membrane antigen HBED-CC (68Ga-PSMA), 18F-DCFPyL, 18F-fluoromethylcholine (18F-FCH), and 18F-dihydrotestosterone (18F-FDHT). Knowledge on the variability of tracer uptake in healthy tissues is important for accurate PET interpretation, because malignancy is suspected only if the uptake of a lesion contrasts with its background. Therefore, the aim of this study was to quantify uptake variability of PCa tracers in healthy tissues and identify stable reference regions for PET interpretation. Methods: A total of 232 PCa PET/CT scans from multiple hospitals was analyzed, including 87 68Ga-PSMA scans, 50 18F-DCFPyL scans, 68 18F-FCH scans, and 27 18F-FDHT scans. Tracer uptake was assessed in the blood pool, lung, liver, bone marrow, and muscle using several SUVs (SUVmax, SUVmean, SUVpeak). Variability in uptake between patients was analyzed using the coefficient of variation (COV%). For all tracers, SUV reference ranges (95th percentiles) were calculated, which could be applicable as image-based quality control for future PET acquisitions. Results: For 68Ga-PSMA, the lowest uptake variability was observed in the blood pool (COV, 19.9%), which was significantly more stable than all other tissues (COV, 29.8%-35.2%; P = 0.001-0.024). For 18F-DCFPyL, the lowest variability was observed in the blood pool and liver (COV, 14.4% and 21.7%, respectively; P = 0.001-0.003). The least variable 18F-FCH uptake was observed in the liver, blood pool, and bone marrow (COV, 16.8%-24.2%; P = 0.001-0.012). For 18F-FDHT, low uptake variability was observed in all tissues, except the lung (COV, 14.6%-23.6%; P = 0.001-0.040). The different SUV types had limited effect on variability (COVs within 3 percentage points). Conclusion: In this multicenter analysis, healthy tissues with limited uptake variability were identified, which may serve as reference regions for PCa PET interpretation. These reference regions include the blood pool for 68Ga-PSMA and 18F-DCFPyL and the liver for 18F-FCH and 18F-FDHT.

Rehabilitative interventions incorporate pelvic floor muscle training, biofeedback, electrical stimulation, lifestyle changes, or a combination of these strategies. However, little is known about the physiological impact of whole-body vibration for stress urinary incontinence after radical prostatectomy.  Objective:   To investigate the effect of whole-body vibration training on stress urinary incontinence after prostate cancer surgery.  Design:   Randomised controlled trial.  Setting:   Tertiary university hospitals.  Participants:   Sixty-one patients with mild stress urinary incontinence after radical prostatectomy.  Intervention:   Group 1 included 30 patients who performed pelvic floor muscle training and whole-body vibration training with a frequency and amplitude of 20Hz/2mm for the first two sessions and 40Hz/4mm for the rest of the intervention. Group 2 included 31 patients who performed pelvic floor muscle training alone. The intervention in both groups was conducted three times per week for 4 weeks.  Main outcomes:   Incontinence Visual Analogue Scale (I-VAS) score, International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire-Urinary Incontinence-Short Form (ICIQ-UI-SF) score and 24-hour pad test result.  Results:   I-VAS score, ICIQ-UI-SF score and 24-hour pad test result showed significant within-group differences at each assessment with the exception of the baseline and post-intervention I-VAS score in Group 2. For example, Group 1 I-VAS score had a median difference of 3.9cm [95% confidence interval (CI) -4.0 to -3.8] from baseline to first follow-up, and a median difference of -2.0cm (95% CI -2.2 to -1.8) at 4-week follow-up. Comparisons between the groups demonstrated significant differences in favour of Group 1 after 4 weeks of intervention and at follow-up for all measured parameters.

Methods / design:   This is an international, multi-center single arm prospective feasibility study that aims to include 34 patients with HRPC and a dominant debilitating symptom. The dominant symptomatic lesion will receive 4 × 5 Gy of high-precision radiotherapy, and the most aggressive part of the lesion 4 × 7 Gy using a simultaneous integrated boost technique. Based on advanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), an apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) map will be calculated for the lesion using diffusion weighted imaging sequences. The dominant symptomatic lesion (GTV1) is drawn manually using the information from T2w-MRI and computed tomography scans. The most aggressive part of the dominant lesion (GTV2) is defined by using the ADC map. An auxiliary volume is created including only voxels in the GTV1 that presents with ADC values below 1200 × 10- 6 mm2/s. The most aggressive part is defined as voxels with an ADC value below the median ADC value. Primary endpoint is feasibility, i.e. proportion of patients who complete radiotherapy with ≥90% of the prescribed dose. Secondary endpoints include dominant symptom score, progression-free survival (freedom from symptoms), overall survival, acute toxicity, quality of life, change in ADC from baseline to end of treatment and 6 months following treatment.

We present the construction of the ADAM-pelvis phantom, an anthropomorphic, deformable and multimodal (CT and MRI) phantom of the male pelvis. The phantom covers patient-like uncertainties in image-guided radiotherapy workflows including imaging artifacts for the special case of the human anatomy as well as organ motion. Principles and methods were further improved from previous work. The phantom includes surrogates for muscle tissue, adipose, inner and outer bone, as well as deformable silicone organs. Anthropomorphic shapes are realized with 3D-printing techniques for the bone and the construction of the hollow silicone organ shells. Organs are constructed from patient image segmentation and further guided by reported deformation models. Imaging markers and pockets for dosimeters are included in the organ shells. The improved phantom surrogates match imaging characteristics in MRI (T1 and T2 relaxation time) and CT (Hounsfield units) of human tissues. The surrogates are suited for long term use (several months) of the phantom. Previously reported artifacts of the muscle surrogate were avoided by improved composition of the used agarose gel. Interfractional organ motion is successfully realized for the water filled bladder and the air filled rectum and showed to be reproducible with deviation below 1 mm. Volume variations of both induce displacement, rotation and deformation of the prostate. We present solutions for the construction of an anthropomorphic phantom suitable for MRI and CT imaging including deformable organs. The developed concepts of phantom surrogates and construction techniques were successfully applied in building the ADAM-pelvis phantom and can as well be adopted for other anthropomorphic phantoms. The presented phantom allows for the systematic and controlled investigation of image-guided radiotherapy workflows in presence of organ motion.""","""['N I Niebuhr', 'W Johnen', 'G Echner', 'A Runz', 'M Bach', 'M Stoll', 'K Giske', 'S Greilich', 'A Pfaffenberger']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Phys Med Biol""","""['Technical Note: Radiological properties of tissue surrogates used in a multimodality deformable pelvic phantom for MR-guided radiotherapy.', 'Technical Note: ADAM PETer - An anthropomorphic, deformable and multimodality pelvis phantom with positron emission tomography extension for radiotherapy.', 'An end-to-end test for MR-guided online adaptive radiotherapy.', 'Advances in anthropomorphic thorax phantoms for radiotherapy: a review.', 'Medical physics challenges in clinical MR-guided radiotherapy.', 'Patient-specific quality assurance strategies for synthetic computed tomography in magnetic resonance-only radiotherapy of the abdomen.', 'Silicone-based materials with tailored MR relaxation characteristics for use in reduced coil visibility and in tissue-mimicking phantom design.', 'Utilisation of 3D Printing in the Manufacturing of an Anthropomorphic Paediatric Head Phantom for the Optimisation of Scanning Parameters in CT.', 'Development of an anthropomorphic multimodality pelvic phantom for quantitative evaluation of a deep-learning-based synthetic computed tomography generation technique.', 'Dosimetric considerations for moldable silicone composites used in radiotherapy applications.']"""

It also shows good efficiency to skin cancer cells. In the current work, we studied the mechanism of interaction between the anticancer drug noscapine (NOS) and carrier protein human serum albumin (HSA) by using a variety of spectroscopic techniques (fluorescence spectroscopy, time-resolved fluorescence, UV-visible, fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), and circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy), electrochemistry (cyclic voltammetry), and computational methods (molecular docking and molecular dynamic simulation). The steady-state fluorescence results showed that fluorescence intensity of HSA decreased in the presence of NOS via a static quenching mechanism, which involves ground state complex formation between NOS and HSA. UV-visible and FRET results also supported the fluorescence result. The corresponding thermodynamic result shows that binding of NOS with HSA is exothermic in nature, involving electrostatic interactions as major binding forces. The binding results were further confirmed through a cyclic voltammetry approach. The FRET result signifies the energy transfer from Trp214 of HSA to the NOS. Molecular site marker, molecular docking, and MD simulation results indicated that the principal binding site of HSA for NOS is site I.

Purpose:   To evaluate the population net benefit of risk stratification using DCE-MRI for detection of high-grade prostate cancer (HGPCA), with or without high spatiotemporal resolution DCE imaging.  Study type:   Decision curve analysis.  Population:   Previously published patient studies on MRI for HGPCA detection, one using DCE with golden-angle radial sparse parallel (GRASP) images and the other using standard DCE-MRI.  Field strength/sequence:   GRASP or standard DCE-MRI at 3 T.  Assessment:   Each study reported the proportion of lesions with HGPCA in each Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System version 2 (PI-RADS v2) category (1-5), before and after reclassification of peripheral zone lesions from PI-RADS 3-4 based on contrast-enhanced images. This additional risk stratifying information was translated to population net benefit, when biopsy was hypothetically performed for: all lesions, no lesions, PI-RADS ≥3 (using NC-MRI), and PI-RADS ≥4 on DCE.  Statistical tests:   Decision curve analysis was performed for both GRASP and standard DCE-MRI data, translating the avoidance of unnecessary biopsies and detection of HGPCA to population net benefit. We standardized net benefit values for HGPCA prevalence and graphically summarized the comparative net benefit of biopsy strategies.  Results:   For a clinically relevant range of risk thresholds for HGPCA (>11%), GRASP DCE-MRI with biopsy of PI-RADS ≥4 lesions provided the highest net benefit, while biopsy of PI-RADS ≥3 lesions provided highest net benefit at low personal risk thresholds (2-11%). In the same range of risk thresholds using standard DCE-MRI, the optimal strategy was biopsy for all lesions (0-15% risk threshold) or PI-RADS ≥3 on NC-MRI (16-33% risk threshold).  Data conclusion:   GRASP DCE-MRI may potentially enable biopsy of PI-RADS ≥4 lesions, providing relatively preserved detection of HGPCA and avoidance of unnecessary biopsies compared with biopsy of all PI-RADS ≥3 lesions.

The goal was to design clinical trial eligibility such that trial results better reflect real-world cancer patient populations, to improve clinical trial participation, and to increase patient access to new treatments in trials. Yet despite the assumed influence of comorbidities on trial participation, the relationship between patients' comorbidity profile at diagnosis and trial participation has not been explicitly examined using patient-level data.  Objectives:   To investigate the association between comorbidities, clinical trial decision-making, and clinical trial participation; and to estimate the potential impact of reducing comorbidity exclusion criteria on trial participation, to provide a benchmark for changing criteria.  Design, setting, and participants:   A national survey was embedded within a web-based cancer treatment-decision tool accessible on multiple cancer-oriented websites. Participants must have received a diagnosis of breast, lung, colorectal, or prostate cancer. In total, 5499 surveyed patients who made a treatment decision within the past 3 months were analyzed using logistic regression analysis and simulations.  Exposures:   Cancer diagnosis and 1 or more of 18 comorbidities.  Main outcomes and measures:   Patient discussion of a clinical trial with their physician (yes vs no); if a trial was discussed, the offer of trial participation (yes vs no); and, if trial participation was offered, trial participation (yes vs no).  Results:   Of the 5499 patients who participated in the survey, 3420 (62.6%) were women and 2079 (37.8%) were men (mean [SD] age, 56.63 [10.05] years). Most patients (65.6%; n = 3610) had 1 or more comorbidities. The most common comorbid condition was hypertension (35.0%; n = 1924). Compared with the absence of comorbidities, the presence of 1 or more comorbidities was associated with a decreased risk of trial discussions (44.1% vs 37.2%; OR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.75-0.97; P = .02), trial offers (21.7% vs 15.7%; OR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.70-0.96; P = .02), and trial participation (11.3% vs 7.8%; OR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.61-0.94; P = .01). The removal of the ASCO-recommended comorbidity restrictions could generate up to 6317 additional patient trial registrations every year.  Conclusions and relevance:   Independent of sociodemographic variables, the presence of comorbidities is adversely associated with trial discussions, trial offers, and trial participation itself. Updating trial eligibility criteria could provide an opportunity for several thousand more patients with well-managed comorbidities to participate in clinical trials each year.""","""['Joseph M Unger', 'Dawn L Hershman', 'Mark E Fleury', 'Riha Vaidya']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""JAMA Oncol""","""['Error in Figure.', 'Drivers of Clinical Trial Participation-Demographics, Disparities, and Eligibility Criteria.', ""Patients' reasoning regarding the decision to participate in clinical cancer trials: an interview study."", 'Patient and physician factors associated with participation in cervical and uterine cancer trials: an NRG/GOG247 study.', 'Patient income level and cancer clinical trial participation.', 'Involving South Asian patients in clinical trials.', 'Available, accessible, aware, appropriate, and acceptable: a strategy to improve participation of teenagers and young adults in cancer trials.', 'Impact of diabetes on stage I lung cancer treatment patterns and prognosis in older adults: A population-based cohort study.', 'Eligibility criteria in clinical trials in breast cancer: a cohort study.', 'Real-world Outcomes Associated With Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerase Inhibitor Monotherapy Maintenance in Patients With Primary Advanced Ovarian Cancer.', 'Adjuvant chemotherapy for locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer: still state of the art or an outdated therapy?', 'Challenges to Recruiting Men on Active Surveillance for Prostate Cancer in Clinical Chemoprevention Trials.']"""

Methods:   Pathology reports for cases accessioned 2011 to 2017 at two hospitals were retrieved. IHC orders by pathologist and hospital were extracted with a custom program and tabulated. The diagnostic category (and highest grade cancer if applicable) was obtained by a hierarchical (free text) string matching algorithm.  Results:   The study period contained 4477 biopsy sets. Categorized by worst pathology (% stained), the cohort was: benign: 1184 cases (42%); prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia: 168 (68%); suspicious: 323 (93%); grade group 1 cancer (WHO1): 900 (78%); grade group two (WHO2): 840 (60%); WHO3 cancer: 451 (54%); WHO4 cancer: 363 (46%); WHO5 cancer: 215 (56%); cancer grade not specified: 33 (52%). The hospital was a predictor; site A(2716 biopsies) and site B(1761) accounted for 10,183 and 14,852 IHC, respectively. The cases with IHC decreased in the last 4 years (site A: 57->45%, site B: 79->73%). Thirty-five pathologists read >20 cases each and together interpreted 4418 (range, 21 to 415; median, 88). In total 24,766 IHCs were done on the 4,418 cases (5.6/case). The mean/median/SD/max/min IHCs/case for the 35 pathologists was 5.6/4.1/3.9/15.2/0.9. High IHC users (1st and 2nd quintile pathologists) called more suspicious for malignancy but not significantly more WHO1 than low IHC users.  Conclusions:   IHC use is most frequent at the benign/malignant interface, and dependent on the pathologist and hospital; however, it is independent of WHO1 cancer rate. Diagnostic rate information can inform and define appropriate and rational IHC use.

Several studies have delineated sarcosine as a PCa oncometabolite that increases the migration of malignant prostate cells while decreasing their doubling time. Here, we show that incubation of prostate cells with sarcosine elicited the upregulation of sarcosine N-demethylation enzymes, sarcosine dehydrogenase and pipecolic acid oxidase. This process was accompanied by a considerable increase in the production of the major methyl-donor S-adenosylmethionine (SAMe), together with an elevation of cellular methylation potential. Global DNA methylation analyses revealed increases in methylated CpG islands in distinct prostate cell lines incubated with sarcosine, but not in cells of nonprostate origin. This phenomenon was further associated with marked upregulation of DNA methyltransferases (Dnmts).

Methods:   Using a cross-sectional design, 3348 prostate cancer survivors between 2 and 18 years post diagnosis reported experiences of insomnia using the QLQC30, along with their sociodemographic characteristics, health status and treatment(s) received. The EQ5D-5L and QLQPR25 assessed survivors' overall and prostate cancer-specific health-related quality of life. A hierarchical multiple regression analysis was constructed with three blocks: (1) predisposing (e.g. demographics at diagnosis), (2) precipitating (e.g. disease extent, treatment) and (3) perpetuating factors (e.g. side effects).  Results:   Nineteen percent of survivors reported significant problems sleeping. The final model accounted for 31% of the variance in insomnia scores (p < .001). In order of magnitude, associates of sleep disturbance were urinary symptoms (β = 0.22; p < .001), experiencing symptoms of depression/anxiety (β = 0.18; p < .001), hormone treatment-related symptoms (β = 0.12; p = .001), pain (β = 0.10; p < .001) and bowel symptoms (β = 0.06; p = .005). Having a lower education and more comorbidities at diagnosis also predicted sleep problems.  Conclusion:   Results suggest that it is the ongoing adverse effects of prostate cancer and its treatment (e.g. urinary symptoms) that put survivors most at risk of sleep problems. Strong associations with symptoms of depression/anxiety were also observed. Findings highlight the need for health care practitioners to treat and manage adverse effects of prostate cancer treatment in order to mitigate sleep disturbance in survivors.""","""['Rebecca Maguire', 'Frances J Drummond', 'Paul Hanly', 'Anna Gavin', 'Linda Sharp']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Support Care Cancer""","""[""Effect of investigation intensity and treatment differences on prostate cancer survivor's physical symptoms, psychological well-being and health-related quality of life: a two country cross-sectional study."", 'Symptom clusters and quality of life in breast cancer survivors after cancer treatment in a tertiary hospital in Korea.', 'Cancer-related problems, sleep quality, and sleep disturbance among long-term cancer survivors at 9-years post diagnosis.', ""It's not over when it's over: long-term symptoms in cancer survivors--a systematic review."", 'Sleep disturbance in cancer survivors with lymphedema: a scoping review.', 'Cancer-Related Dysfunctional Beliefs About Sleep Mediate the Influence of Sleep Disturbance on Fear of Progression Among Patients With Surgically Resected Lung Cancer.', 'Update on Prevalence of Pain in Patients with Cancer 2022: A Systematic Literature Review and Meta-Analysis.', 'Which Aspects of Psychological Resilience Moderate the Association between Deterioration in Sleep and Depression in Patients with Prostate Cancer?', 'Prostate Cancer and Sleep Disorders: A Systematic Review.', 'Prospective Rates, Longitudinal Associations, and Factors Associated With Comorbid Insomnia Symptoms and Perceived Cognitive Impairment.']"""

The GSE60319 expression profile was downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. The GEO2R was applied to screen for differentially expressed microRNAs (DEmiRNAs) between the embolic stroke group and thrombotic stroke group. The miRWalk was utilized to predict the target genes of DEmiRNAs. Genes associated with embolic stroke were downloaded from the Comparative Toxicogenomics Database. Cross reference of target genes to disease related genes was conducted to construct the DEmiRNA-gene network. The protein-protein interaction (PPI) network of overlapping genes was evaluated by STRING, using the MCODE and CytoHubba plugin of Cytoscape to identify the modules and hub genes. The enrichment of Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) in modules was performed. There were 30 microRNAs in total identified as DEmiRNAs between embolic stroke and thrombotic stroke groups, of which 8 were upregulated and 22 were downregulated. Among these differentially expressed miRNAs, miR-15a-5p, miR-17-5p, miR-19b-3p, and miR-20a-5p were significantly associated with an ES to TS. Using the miRWalk 3.0 online tool, target genes regulated by DEmiRNAs were predicted. In addition, disease related genes were predicted and compared with target genes of DEmiRNAs. 166 overlapped genes regulated by miR-15a-5p, miR-17-5p, miR-19b-3p, and miR-20a-5p were identified, suggesting their association with diseases that contributed to ES, mainly including atrial fibrillation, mitral valve stenosis, myocardial infarction, and aortic dissection. Therefore, miR-15a-5p, miR-17-5p, miR-19b-3p, and miR-20a-5p were promising candidate biomarkers for differentiating an ES from TS. The PPI network demonstrated that miR-15a-5p, miR-17-5p, miR-19b-3p, and miR-20a-5p were associated with an ES by mainly regulating ""CCND1, E2F2, E2F3, ITCH, UBE4A, UBE3C, RBL2, FBXO31, EIF2C4, and EIF2C1"".

Paraffin serial sections were obtained from each specimen to perform histological classifications and immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis.

IHC demonstrated the expression of markers of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (VIM), bone mineralization, and osteoblastic differentiation (BMP-2, PTX-3, RUNX2, RANKL, and VDR) in prostate lesions characterized by the presence of calcium-phosphate microcalcifications and high metastatic potential. Ultrastructural studies revealed the presence of prostate cancer cells with osteoblast phenotype close to microcalcifications. Noteworthy, PET/CT analysis showed higher uptake of 18F-choline in BM+ lesions with high positivity (≥300/500 cells) for RUNX2 and/or RANKL immunostaining.

It is well known that the bulk of prostate cancer cells express androgen receptor (AR) and that androgens are required for prostate cancer growth, progression, and emergence of castration-resistant disease. In contrast, the small subpopulation of self-renewing CSCs exhibits an AR-negative (AR-) signature. The mechanisms underlying the absence of AR are unknown. Using CSC-like cell models isolated from clinical biopsy tissues, we identify the E3 ligase MDM2 as a key regulator of prostate CSC integrity. First, unlike what has been reported for the bulk of AR+ tumor cells where MDM2 regulates the temporal expression of AR during transcriptional activity, MDM2 in CSCs promoted the constant ubiquitination and degradation of AR, resulting in sustained loss of total AR protein. Second, MDM2 promoted CSC self-renewal, the expression of stem cell factors, and CSC proliferation. Loss of MDM2 reversed these processes and induced expression of full-length AR (and not AR variants), terminal differentiation into luminal cells, and cell death. Selectively blocking MDM2-mediated activity in combination with androgen/AR-targeted therapy may offer a novel strategy for eliminating AR- CSCs in addition to the bulk of AR+ prostate cancer cells, decreasing metastatic tumor burden and inhibiting the emergence of therapeutic resistance.Significance: These findings provide a novel mechanistic aspect of prostate cancer cell stemness that advances our understanding of the diverse transcriptional activity that bypasses AR in contributing to therapeutic resistance, tumor progression, and metastasis.Graphical Abstract: http://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/canres/79/6/1124/F1.large.jpg.""","""['Premkumar Vummidi Giridhar#', 'Karin Williams#', 'Andrew P VonHandorf#', 'Paul L Deford', 'Susan Kasper']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Cancer Res""","""['LncRNA HOTAIR Enhances the Androgen-Receptor-Mediated Transcriptional Program and Drives Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Artemisinin disrupts androgen responsiveness of human prostate cancer cells by stimulating the 26S proteasome-mediated degradation of the androgen receptor protein.', 'p21-Activated kinase 6 (PAK6) inhibits prostate cancer growth via phosphorylation of androgen receptor and tumorigenic E3 ligase murine double minute-2 (Mdm2).', 'Androgen receptor and prostate cancer stem cells: biological mechanisms and clinical implications.', 'Androgen action in the prostate gland.', 'MDM2- an indispensable player in tumorigenesis.', 'Glucocorticoid Receptor and β-Catenin Interact in Prostate Cancer Cells and Their Co-Inhibition Attenuates Tumorsphere Formation, Stemness, and Docetaxel Resistance.', 'Practical Understanding of Cancer Model Identifiability in Clinical Applications.', 'Targeted Degradation of Androgen Receptor by VNPP433-3β in Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer Cells Implicates Interaction with E3 Ligase MDM2 Resulting in Ubiquitin-Proteasomal Degradation.', 'The role of ubiquitination in spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy.']"""

Most CRPC treatments target androgen receptor (AR) signaling. However, not all CRPC cells rely on AR activity for survival and proliferation. With advances in immunotherapy and fluid biopsies for cancer management, expression systems specific for both AR-positive and -negative PCa are required for virus-based vaccines and cell imaging. To target both AR-responsive and non-responsive cells, we developed a three-step transcriptional amplification (3STA) system based on the progression elevated gene-3 (PEG3) promoter named PEG3AP1-3STA. Notably, we report on different genetic modifications that significantly improved PEG3 promoter's strength in PCa cells. Adenoviruses incorporating PEG3 promoter with and without transcriptional amplification systems were generated. The potential of PEG3AP1-3STA to target PCa cells was then evaluated in vitro and in vivo in androgen-responsive and non-responsive PCa cell lines. PEG3AP1-3STA was shown to be active in all PCa cell lines and not regulated by androgens, and its activity was amplified 97-fold compared to that of a non-amplified promoter. The PEG3AP1-3STA system can thus be used to target advanced AR+ and AR- cells for imaging or immunovirotherapy in advanced PCa.""","""['Pallavi Jain', 'Pier-Luc Clermont', 'Francis Desmeules', 'Amina Zoubeidi', 'Bertrand Neveu', 'Frédéric Pouliot']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Int J Mol Sci""","""['A PCA3 gene-based transcriptional amplification system targeting primary prostate cancer.', 'Transcription of Nrdp1 by the androgen receptor is regulated by nuclear filamin A in prostate cancer.', 'Androgen receptors in hormone-dependent and castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Identification of an anabolic selective androgen receptor modulator that actively induces death of androgen-independent prostate cancer cells.', 'Molecular model for neuroendocrine prostate cancer progression.', 'A transcriptional biosensor to monitor single cancer cell therapeutic responses by bioluminescence microscopy.', 'Role of the zinc finger and SCAN domain-containing transcription factors in cancer.']"""

Such data can improve understanding of hematuria and cancer and can provide insight into the clinical course of patients with hematuria.  Objective:   To assess the risk of urologic or nonurologic cancer after a hospital-based diagnosis of hematuria.  Design, setting, and participants:   This cohort study used population-based, nationwide health care databases covering all hospitals in Denmark. The data set included records of all adults (n = 134 173) with an inpatient, outpatient, or emergency department diagnosis of hematuria. The study was conducted from January 1, 1995, to December 31, 2013. Follow-up ended on December 31, 2013. Data analysis was performed from January 16, 2017, to September 18, 2018.  Main outcomes and measures:   Cumulative risk of cancer was computed, and observed cancer incidence was compared with incidence expected in the general population, using standardized incidence ratios.  Results:   Of the 134 173 patients included, 52 367 (39.0%) were women, 81 806 (61.0%) were men, and the median (interquartile range) age was 59 (44-72) years. Within 3 months after hematuria diagnosis, 2647 patients (1.9%) received an invasive bladder cancer diagnosis, 1077 (0.8%) a noninvasive bladder cancer diagnosis, 569 (0.4%) a kidney cancer diagnosis, and 908 (1.1%) a prostate cancer diagnosis. The 3-month cumulative incidence (or absolute risk) of any cancer diagnosis was 4.81% (95% CI, 4.70%-4.93%), the 1-year risk was 6.65% (95% CI, 6.51%-6.78%), and the 5-year risk was 12.34% (95% CI, 12.15%-12.53%). The cumulative incidence of bladder cancer only increased from 1.20% (95% CI, 1.11%-1.30%) after 1 year to 1.36% (95% CI, 1.26%-1.46%) after 5 years of follow-up in women and from 2.93% (95% CI, 2.82%-3.05%) to 3.31% (95% CI, 3.19%-3.44%) in men. For noninvasive bladder cancer, the standardized incidence ratio in the 1 year to less than 5 years of follow-up was 5.39 (95% CI, 4.58-6.30) in patients without initial cystoscopy and was 0.16 (95% CI, 0.04-0.42) in patients with cystoscopy within 3 months after hospital-based diagnosis of hematuria. For kidney cancer, the standardized incidence ratio in the 1 year to less than 5 years of follow-up was 2.63 (95% CI, 2.15-3.18) in patients without cystoscopy and 1.20 (95% CI, 0.87-1.61) in patients with cystoscopy within 3 months after hospital-based diagnosis of hematuria. After 1 year, the risk of gynecologic and colorectal cancers was as expected or even lower, whereas the risk of hematologic malignant neoplasms remained slightly elevated.  Conclusions and relevance:   Increased risk of bladder and kidney cancers even more than 1 year after hospital-based hematuria diagnosis, as well as the slightly elevated risk of invasive bladder cancer after 5 years, may indicate that it is a marker of greater cancer risk; these findings could inform follow-up recommendations for hematuria.""","""['Mette Nørgaard', 'Katalin Veres', 'Anne Gulbech Ording', 'Jens Christian Djurhuus', 'Jørgen Bjerggaard Jensen', 'Henrik Toft Sørensen']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""JAMA Netw Open""","""['Italian cancer figures, report 2013: Multiple tumours.', 'Pneumonia and the incidence of cancer: a Danish nationwide cohort study.', 'Implantable cardioverter-defibrillators and subsequent cancer risk: a nationwide population-based cohort study.', 'Surgical treatment for urinary incontinence in women - Danish nationwide cohort studies\u2029.', 'Risk for cancer in a cohort of patients hospitalized for schizophrenia in Denmark, 1969-1993.', 'Non-Traumatic Subdural Hematoma and Cancer: A Cohort Study.', 'Association Between Bleeding and New Cancer Detection and the Prognosis in Patients With Myocardial Infarction.', 'Risk of More Advanced Lesions at Hysterectomy after Initial Diagnosis of Non-Atypical Endometrial Hyperplasia in Patients with Postmenopausal Bleeding and Oral Anticoagulant Treatment.', 'Flexible Cystoscopy in the Setting of Macroscopic Hematuria: Do the Findings Justify Its Use?', 'New Cancer Diagnosis After Bleeding in Anticoagulated Patients With Atrial Fibrillation.']"""

Objectives:   To quantify between-hospital variation in quality-related outcomes and identify hospital characteristics associated with high and low performance.  Design, setting, and participants:   This retrospective cohort study obtained data through linkage of the California Cancer Registry to hospital discharge claims databases maintained by the California Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development. All 351 acute care hospitals in California at which 1 or more adults underwent curative intent surgery between January 1, 2007, and December 31, 2011, with analyses finalized July 15, 2018, were included. A total of 138 799 adults undergoing surgery for colorectal, breast, lung, prostate, bladder, thyroid, kidney, endometrial, pancreatic, liver, or esophageal cancer within 6 months of diagnosis, with an American Joint Committee on Cancer stage of I to III at diagnosis, were included.  Main outcomes and measures:   Measures included adjusted odds ratios and variance components from hierarchical mixed-effects logistic regression analyses of in-hospital mortality, 90-day readmission, and 90-day mortality, as well as hospital-specific risk-adjusted rates and risk-adjusted standardized rate ratios for hospitals with a mean annual surgical volume of 10 or more.  Results:   Across 138 799 patients at the 351 included hospitals, 8.9% were aged 18 to 44 years and 45.9% were aged 65 years or older, 57.4% were women, and 18.2% were nonwhite. Among these, 1240 patients (0.9%) died during the index admission. Among 137 559 patients discharged alive, 19 670 (14.3%) were readmitted and 1754 (1.3%) died within 90 days. After adjusting for patient case-mix differences, evidence of statistically significant variation in risk across hospitals was identified, as characterized by the variance of the random effects in the mixed model, for all 3 metrics (P < .001). In addition, substantial variation was observed in hospital performance profiles: across 260 hospitals with a mean annual surgical volume of 10 or more, 59 (22.7%) had lower-than-expected rates for all 3 metrics, 105 (40.4%) had higher-than-expected rates for 2 of the 3, and 19 (7.3%) had higher-than-expected rates for all 3 metrics.  Conclusions and relevance:   Accounting for patient case-mix differences, there appears to be substantial between-hospital variation in in-hospital mortality, 90-day readmission, and 90-day mortality after cancer surgical procedures. Recognizing the multifaceted nature of hospital performance through consideration of mortality and readmission simultaneously may help to prioritize strategies for improving surgical outcomes.""","""['Sebastien Haneuse', 'Francesca Dominici', 'Sharon-Lise Normand', 'Deborah Schrag']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""JAMA Netw Open""","""['Variation Across the Continuum of Surgical Oncology Care.', 'Comparison of Rates and Outcomes of Readmission to Index vs Nonindex Hospitals After Major Cancer Surgery.', 'Association of US Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Hospital 30-Day Risk-Standardized Readmission Metric With Care Quality and Outcomes After Acute Myocardial Infarction: Findings From the National Cardiovascular Data Registry/Acute Coronary Treatment and Intervention Outcomes Network Registry-Get With the Guidelines.', 'Comparison of Risk-Standardized Readmission Rates of Surgical Patients at Safety-Net and Non-Safety-Net Hospitals Using Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality and American Hospital Association Data.', 'Defining Rates and Risk Factors for Readmissions Following Emergency General Surgery.', 'Quality Assurance, Metrics, and Improving Standards in Rectal Cancer Surgery in the United States.', 'MEASURING PERFORMANCE FOR END-OF-LIFE CARE.', 'Between-hospital variations in 3-year survival among patients with newly diagnosed gastric, colorectal, and lung cancer.', 'Multilevel factors associated with inequities in multidisciplinary cancer consultation.', 'Implementation Experience with a 30-Day Hospital Readmission Risk Score in a Large, Integrated Health System: A Retrospective Study.', 'Evidence for racial/ethnic disparities in emergency department visits following breast cancer surgery among women in California: a population-based study.']"""

With the recent extension of the Veterans Access, Choice, and Accountability Act, the government has provided funds for veterans to seek care outside the Veterans Health Administration (VA). It is important to understand the difference in imaging rates and subsequent differences in patterns of care in the VA vs a traditional fee-for-service setting such as Medicare.  Objective:   To assess the association between prostate cancer imaging rates and a VA vs fee-for-service health care setting.  Design, setting, and participants:   This cohort study included data for men who received a diagnosis of prostate cancer from January 1, 2004, through March 31, 2008, that were collected from the VA Central Cancer Registry, linked to administrate claims and Medicare utilization records, and the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program database. Three distinct nationally representative cohorts were constructed (use of VA only, use of Medicare only, and dual use of VA and Medicare). Men older than 85 years at diagnosis and men without high-risk features but missing any tumor risk characteristic (prostate-specific antigen, Gleason grade, or clinical stage) were excluded. Analysis of the data was completed from March 2016 to February 2018.  Exposures:   Patient utilization of different health care delivery systems.  Main outcomes and measures:   Rates of prostate cancer imaging were analyzed by health care setting (Medicare only, VA and Medicare, and VA only) among patients with low-risk prostate cancer and patients with high-risk prostate cancer.  Results:   Of 98 867 men with prostate cancer (77.4% white; mean [SD] age, 70.26 [7.48] years) in the study cohort, 57.3% were in the Medicare-only group, 14.5% in the VA and Medicare group, and 28.1% in the VA-only group. Among men with low-risk prostate cancer, the Medicare-only group had the highest rate of guideline-discordant imaging (52.5%), followed by the VA and Medicare group (50.9%) and the VA-only group (45.9%) (P < .001). Imaging rates for men with high-risk prostate cancer were not significantly different among the 3 groups. Multivariable analysis showed that individuals in the VA and Medicare group (risk ratio [RR], 0.87; 95% CI, 0.76-0.98) and VA-only group (RR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.67-0.92) were less likely to receive guideline-discordant imaging than those in the Medicare-only group.

Rapid and simpler (approximately 15-minute) biparametric MRI (bpMRI) using fewer scan sequences could be implemented as a prostate MRI triage test on a larger scale before performing biopsies.  Objectives:   To assess the diagnostic accuracy and negative predictive value (NPV) of a novel bpMRI method in biopsy-naive men in detecting and ruling out significant prostate cancer in confirmatory biopsies.  Design, setting, and participants:   A single-institutional, paired, prospective cohort study of biopsy-naive men with clinical suspicion of prostate cancer from November 1, 2015, to June 15, 2017.  Interventions:   All patients underwent bpMRI (T2-weighted and diffusion-weighted imaging) followed by standard transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsies (all men) and targeted biopsies of men with suspicious bpMRI findings.  Main outcomes and measures:   Suspicion grades of bpMRI, biopsy results, and NPV of bpMRI were evaluated for detection of or ruling out significant prostate cancer (Gleason score ≥4 + 3 or maximum cancerous core length >50% for Gleason score 3 + 4). We compared the diagnostic performance of standard biopsies in all men vs standard plus targeted (combined) biopsies restricted to men with suspicious bpMRI findings. The reference standard was combined biopsy results from all men.  Results:   A total of 1020 men were enrolled, with a median age of 67 years (interquartile range, 61-71 years) and a median prostate-specific antigen level of 8.0 ng/mL (interquartile range, 5.7-13.0 ng/mL). Combined biopsies detected any and significant prostate cancer in 655 of 1020 men (64%) and 404 of 1020 men (40%), respectively. Restricting combined biopsies to men with suspicious bpMRI findings meant 305 of 1020 men (30%) with low-suspicious bpMRIs could avoid prostate biopsies (biopsy in 715 men with suspicious bpMRIs vs all 1020 men who required standard biopsies [70%]; P < .001). Significant prostate cancer diagnoses were improved by 11% (396 vs 351 men; P < .001), and insignificant prostate cancer diagnoses were reduced by 40% (173 vs 288 men; P < .001) compared with our current diagnostic standard, standard biopsies alone in all men. The NPV of bpMRI findings in ruling out significant prostate cancer was 97% (95% CI, 95%-99%).  Conclusions and relevance:   Low-suspicion bpMRI has a high NPV in ruling out significant prostate cancer in biopsy-naive men. Using a simple and rapid bpMRI method as a triage test seems to improve risk stratification and may be used to exclude aggressive disease and avoid unnecessary biopsies with its inherent risks.

We demonstrate 100-fold heterogeneity in AR output within human prostate cancer cell lines and show that cells with high AR output have reduced sensitivity to enzalutamide. Through transcriptomic and shRNA knockdown studies, together with analysis of clinical datasets, we identify GREB1 as a gene responsible for high AR output. We show that GREB1 is an AR target gene that amplifies AR output by enhancing AR DNA binding and promoting EP300 recruitment.

Adenine nucleotides are important signaling molecules that mediate innumerous biological functions in pathophysiological conditions, including cancer. These molecules are degraded by several ectoenzymes named ectonucleotidases that produce adenosine in the extracellular medium. Some of these ecto-enzymes can be found in soluble in the blood stream. Thus, the present study aimed to evaluate the hydrolysis of adenine nucleotides (ATP, ADP, and AMP) in the plasma blood of patients with prostate cancer. Peripheral blood samples were collected, and questionnaires were filled based on the clinical data of the medical records. The nucleotide hydrolysis was performed by Malachite Green method using ATP, ADP, and AMP as substrates. Plasma from prostate cancer patients presented an elevated hydrolysis of all nucleotides evaluated when compared to healthy individuals. NTPDase inhibitor (ARL67156) and the alkaline phosphatase inhibitor (levamisole) did not alter ATP hydrolysis. However, AMP hydrolysis was reduced by the CD73 inhibitor, APCP, and by levamisole, suggesting the action of a soluble form of CD73 and alkaline phosphatase. On microvesicles, it was observed that there was a low expression and activity of CD39 and almost absent of CD73. The correlation of ATP, ADP, and AMP hydrolysis with clinic pathological data demonstrated that patients who received radiotherapy showed a higher AMP hydrolysis than those who did not, and patients with lower clinical stage (CS-IIA) presented an elevated ATP hydrolysis when compared to those with more advanced clinical stages (CS-IIB and CS-III). Patients of all clinical stages presented an elevated AMPase activity. Therefore, we can suggest that the nucleotide hydrolysis might be attributed to soluble ecto-enzymes present in the plasma, which, in a coordinate manner, produce adenosine in the blood stream, favoring prostate cancer progression.""","""['Carla Fernanda Furtado Gardani', 'Angélica Regina Cappellari', 'Julia Brandt de Souza', 'Bruna Tertuliano da Silva', 'Paula Engroff', 'Cesar Eduardo Jacintho Moritz', 'Juliete Nathali Scholl', 'Ana Maria Oliveira Battastini', 'Fabrício Figueiró', 'Fernanda Bueno Morrone']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Purinergic Signal""","""['AMP hydrolysis reduction in blood plasma of breast cancer elderly patients after different treatments.', ""E-NTPDases and ecto-5'-nucleotidase expression profile in rat heart left ventricle and the extracellular nucleotide hydrolysis by their nerve terminal endings."", 'Role of extracellular ATP metabolism in regulation of platelet reactivity.', 'Purinergic signaling in the modulation of redox biology.', 'Ectonucleotidases in tumor cells and tumor-associated immune cells: an overview.', 'Tumor intrinsic and extrinsic functions of CD73 and the adenosine pathway in lung cancer.', 'CD39/CD73/A2AR pathway and cancer immunotherapy.', 'Differential Immunomodulatory Effects of Head and Neck Cancer-Derived Exosomes on B Cells in the Presence of ATP.', 'Evaluation of aliphatic acid metabolism in bladder cancer with the goal of guiding therapeutic treatment.', 'Protein kinase inhibitor ceritinib blocks ectonucleotidase CD39 - a promising target for cancer immunotherapy.']"""

Materials and methods:   With regard to salvage treatment failure (sTF), 46 consecutive patients, undergoing 52 sLND for nodal recurrence detected by PET/CT scan were stratified in 3 groups (group A: post-sLND PSA nadir < 0.01 ng/ml and in follow-up reaching a value > 0.2 ng/ml, group B: post-sLND PSA nadir > 0.01 ng/ml and in follow-up reaching a value equal to pre-sLND PSA; group C: additional salvage treatment administration). Surgical outcome of patients was analyzed by descriptive statistics (Student's t test for continuous variables, Chi-square and Fisher's test for categorial ones). Time to sTF of each group was analyzed and compared by Kaplan-Meier method and correlations regarding sTF and pre-sLND PSA, time from PCa primary treatment to PET/CT scan, time from PCa primary treatment to sLND and number of positive PET/CT scan spots were assessed.  Results:   Median PSA at PET/CT scan was 2.9 ng/ml (IQR 1.2-6.1). Open and laparoscopic sLND were performed in 40/52 (77%) and 12/52 (23%), respectively. Median number of removed lymph nodes was 6 (IQR 4-13). Histological report was positive for PCa in 39/52 sLND (75%). Median blood loss was 50 ml (IQR 0-50, range 0-600). Median length of hospital stay was 5 days (IQR 4-6). 4 and 7 patients had low-grade (I/II) and high-grade (≥ III) Clavien-Dindo complications, respectively. Readmission rates at 30 and 90 days were 5/52 (9.6%) and 1/52 (2%), respectively. sTF was observed in 2/7 (group A), 12/12 (group B) and 22/22 patients (group C). Median time to sTF in group B and C was 3.5 (IQR 1.7-13.2) and 4 months (IQR 2.0-10), respectively.  Conclusion:   Even spot-specific PET/CT sLND harbors a measurable (CD > III) morbidity in 1 out of 7 patients. Only patients with positive histological report and a PSA nadir < 0.01 ng/ml after sLND seem to experience a long-term benefit.

In all 19 tumor types, hypoxic tumors exhibited characteristic driver-mutation signatures. We observed widespread hypoxia-associated dysregulation of microRNAs (miRNAs) across cancers and functionally validated miR-133a-3p as a hypoxia-modulated miRNA. In localized prostate cancer, hypoxia was associated with elevated rates of chromothripsis, allelic loss of PTEN and shorter telomeres. These associations are particularly enriched in polyclonal tumors, representing a constellation of features resembling tumor nimbosus, an aggressive cellular phenotype.

Since 2010, five new systemic therapies have been shown to prolong OS in men with mCRPC. We sought to evaluate the aggregate impact of these newer therapies on the OS of patients with mCRPC.  Methods:   Two cohorts of patients diagnosed with mCRPC between 2004 and 2007, treated with drugs used in the limited treatment era only (A), and between 2010 and 2013, treated also with newer therapies (B), were identified from the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute database. The analysis endpoint was OS within 5 years after mCRPC diagnosis. Kaplan-Meier method assessed time-to-event distributions with median (95% confidence interval (CI)). A piece-wise regression model assessed the association between endpoint and treatment cohorts with estimate of hazard ratio (HR) with 95% CI within two time segments in univariate and multivariable analyses adjusting for relevant covariates.  Results:   Compared to cohort A (n = 318), cohort B (n = 272) patients in newer therapy era demonstrated an OS advantage (2.8 vs. 2.2 years) with a 41% decreased risk of death (HR = 0.59; 95% CI, 0.47-0.74; P < 0.0001), and a 3-year OS rate of 46% vs. 33%. This benefit was accentuated (median OS 2.7 vs. 2.1 years; HR = 0.46; 95% CI, 0.32-0.67; P < 0.0001) in patients who initially presented with de-novo metastatic disease (de-novo). On multivariable analysis, longer OS was associated with cohort B vs. A and performance status 0 vs. 1.  Conclusions:   Using a single-institution registry, mCRPC patients treated since 2010 had a significant survival improvement vs. those treated before 2010.

Results: The expression of FOXO4 in prostate cancer cells and tissues was significantly lower than that in the prostate hyperplasia cells and tissues (both P<0.05). In the prostate cancer tissues, the expression of FOXO4 in cancer tissues with prostate cancer specific antigen (PSA) value <4 was significantly higher than that in the tissues with 4≤PSA≤10 and PSA>10 (all P<0.05).

The silencing of MALAT1 inhibited dihydrotestosterone (DHT) administration-induced acceleration of proliferation and cell cycle progression, and increase of AR expression in prostate cancer cells. MALAT1 bound to miR-320b and negatively regulated its expression, and vice versa. AR is a target of miR-320b. The phenotypic changes induced by silencing of MALAT1 were abolished by miR-320b inhibition or AR overexpression. Additionally, MALAT1 knockdown also suppressed the tumorigenesis of prostate cancer cells in nude mice. In summary, the silencing of MALAT1 inactivated AR signaling by sponging miR-320b, and inhibited proliferation and cell cycle progression in prostate cancer cells, suggesting that MALAT1 may be a new target in diagnosis and therapy of prostate cancer in clinic.""","""['Xiaofan Dai', 'Lingyun Liu', 'Zuowen Liang', 'Kaimin Guo', 'Shengqi Xu', 'Hongliang Wang']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Pathol Res Pract""","""['Analysis of the androgen receptor-regulated lncRNA landscape identifies a role for ARLNC1 in prostate cancer progression.', 'Silencing of MALAT1 inhibits migration and invasion by sponging miR‑1‑3p in prostate cancer cells.', 'Novel lncRNA LINC00844 Regulates Prostate Cancer Cell Migration and Invasion through AR Signaling.', 'Relationship between long non-coding RNA MALAT1 and prostate cancer.', 'Long non-coding RNAs related to androgen receptor function in prostate cancer: Advances in studies.', 'Identification of androgen response-related lncRNAs in prostate cancer.', 'Prognostic value of long non-coding RNA MALAT1 in hepatocellular carcinoma: A study based on multi-omics analysis and RT-PCR validation.', 'Long non-coding RNA in prostate cancer.', 'Molecular Landscape of LncRNAs in Prostate Cancer: A focus on pathways and therapeutic targets for intervention.', 'Crosstalk between Long Non Coding RNAs, microRNAs and DNA Damage Repair in Prostate Cancer: New Therapeutic Opportunities?']"""

The 3D displacement error between the pelvic bone and a matching fiducial marker was calculated using MPCT in 24 patients who underwent prostate volumetric-modulated arc therapy for prostate cancer. We calculated the 3D displacement error between the pelvic bone and a matching fiducial marker on MPCT. The correlation of the 3D displacement error with the DSC of the rectum, calculated from MPCT images, was evaluated based on deformable image registration. The 3D displacement error of the prostate showed a slight correlation between MPCT and cone-beam computed tomography (adjusted r2 = 0.241). The 3D displacement error, based on the pelvic bone and a fiducial marker on MPCT images, showed a moderate correlation with the DSC of the rectum (adjusted r2 = 0.645) and was improved by a mean of 3.94 mm, based on MPCT, during the treatment period. The 3D displacement error on MPCT correlates with the 3D displacement error of daily cone-beam computed tomography; optimal selection of MPCT can potentially facilitate on-board setup of prostate patients to enable more accurate radiotherapy. The advance information of the 3D displacement error and rectal deformation is useful for optimal planning CT that can minimize the deviation between the planned dose and the treatment dose in patients receiving treatment for prostate cancer.""","""['Yoshinori Tanabe', 'Takayuki Ishida', 'Hidetoshi Eto', 'Tatsuhiro Sera', 'Yuki Emoto']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Med Dosim""","""['Optimizing planning CT using past CT images for prostate cancer volumetric modulated arc therapy.', 'Patient-specific radiotherapy quality assurance for estimating actual treatment dose.', 'Estimation of rectal dose using daily megavoltage cone-beam computed tomography and deformable image registration.', 'The influence of the bowel and bladder preparation protocol for radiotherapy of prostate cancer using kilo-voltage cone beam CT: Our experience.', 'A systematic review: effectiveness of rectal emptying preparation in prostate cancer patients.', 'Improvement of semantic segmentation through transfer learning of multi-class regions with convolutional neural networks on supine and prone breast MRI images.', 'Geometric and dosimetric evaluation of deep learning based auto-segmentation for clinical target volume on breast cancer.', 'Evaluation of setup errors of immobilization device for radiation therapy in companion animals.', 'Dose prediction for cervical cancer VMAT patients with a full-scale 3D-cGAN-based model and the comparison of different input data on the prediction results.', 'Statistical evaluation of the effectiveness of dual amplitude-gated stereotactic body radiotherapy using fiducial markers and lung volume.']"""

Methods:   Fourteen volunteers (median age, 28.5 years) received a single oral dose of enzalutamide (160 mg) under fasting conditions on day 1 and were followed for 50 days. Pharmacokinetic profiles were obtained for enzalutamide and its major metabolites, carboxylic acid metabolite (M1; inactive metabolite) and N-desmethyl enzalutamide (M2; active metabolite), on day 1 up to 1176 hours (49 days). Safety data were also collected.  Findings:   Enzalutamide plasma concentration rapidly increased (median Tmax, 1.5 hours) followed by a slow decrease (mean t½, 90.7 hours). M1 and M2 plasma concentrations increased gradually with a median Tmax of 72.0 and 121 hours, respectively. M1 and M2 mean metabolite-to-parent ratios were 0.2 and 1.3, respectively. Mean AUC0-∞ of enzalutamide plus M2 was 828 μg h/mL versus 368 μg h/mL for enzalutamide alone. Mean t½, maximum concentration, and Tmax of enzalutamide plus M2 were comparable with those of enzalutamide. Drug-related treatment-emergent adverse events were reported in 4 men (28.6%): 1 each of upper respiratory tract infection, chest discomfort, increased blood bilirubin, and decreased white blood cell count. No deaths or serious treatment-emergent adverse events were observed.  Implications:   The pharmacokinetic profiles of enzalutamide, M1, M2, and enzalutamide plus M2 in healthy Chinese men were generally consistent with those in white men.

Methods:   Multi-institutional pooled cross-sectional analysis on patients in an AS protocol: < 75 years old; pathologically confirmed LPC (maximum of three positive cylinders); Gleason score < 3 + 4; clinical stage T1a-T2b; and PSA < 15 ng/ml. Exclusion criteria for this study were: less than 6 months in AS, termination of AS protocol, or incomplete data. Patients in AS were matched with those treated with RP, XRT or BT from the 'Spanish Multicentric Study of Clinically Localized Prostate Cancer' cohort according to risk group, time from treatment selection to HRQoL survey, and age. Prostate-specific (EPIC) and generic (SF-36) HRQoL instruments were completed. Analysis was stratified by HRQoL survey moment (>or < 2.5 years from treatment selection), and age (>or < 70 years old).  Results:   Median of time from treatment selection to HRQoL survey in the total 396 patients (99 per treatment group) was 2.4 years (range 0.5-8.3). Patients in AS presented higher (better) urinary incontinence scores than RP ones in both stratus of time from treatment selection to HRQoL survey (92.6 vs 67.0 and 81.4 vs 64.4, p < 0.01). Patients in AS for < 2.5 years presented greater sexual scores than any active treatment (p < 0.01), but only statistically higher than RP for those in AS for longer than 2.5 years. The magnitude of the differences between AS and RP groups in both EPIC domains ranged from moderate (0.7 SD) to large (1.0 SD). Regardless of treatment applied, patients presented similar and slightly increased SF-36 scores than US general population reference norms. Nonetheless, patients in AS for < 2.5 years reported worse outcomes than other treatment groups on physical health domains, especially in bodily pain (0.5-0.6 SD), and vitality (0.6-0.8 SD).  Conclusions:   Considering patients' well-being, AS can be a good therapeutic option due to the low impact caused on urinary continence and sexual function.

In addition, no noticeable toxicity was exhibited towards normal cells HFB4. Moreover, in vitro studies of the VEGFR-2 inhibition in human breast cancer MCF-7 cell line for the promising cytotoxic compounds showed that compounds 7a, 8c, 9b, 9c and 9d were potent inhibitors at low micromolar concentrations (IC50 = 0.034-0.582 μM) compared to the reference drug, sorafenib (IC50 = 0.019 μM). Several theoretical and experimental studies were done to reveal the molecular mechanisms that control breast carcinoma metastasis. The mechanistic effectiveness in cell cycle progression, apoptotic induction and gene regulation were assessed for the promising compound 9d due to its remarkable cytotoxic activity against MCF-7 and significant VEGFR-2 inhibition. Flow cytometeric analysis showed that compound 9d induced cell growth cessation at G2/M phase and increased the percentage of cells at pre-G1 phase that stimulates the apoptotic death of MCF-7 cells. Furthermore, real time PCR assay illustrated that compound 9d up regulated p53 gene expression and elevated Bax/Bcl-2 ratio which confirmed the mechanistic pathway of compound 9d. Moreover, the apoptotic induction of breast cancer cells MCF-7 was enhanced effectively through activation of caspases-7 and 9 by compound 9d. On the other hand, a set of in silico methods such as molecular docking, molecular dynamics simulation, QSAR analysis as well as ADMET analysis was performed in order to study the protein-ligand interactions and the relationship between the physicochemical properties and the inhibitory activity of the promising compounds 7a, 8c and 9d.

Our aim was to characterize the use of PRTB in patients who died of PCa in British Columbia between 2003 and 2015.  Methods and materials:   All patients with a diagnosis of PCa who died during the study period (n = 23,260) were identified from a population-based provincial registry. Patient and treatment characteristics were analyzed. PRTB utilization rate was calculated by year and location. Survival was calculated from the first and the last course of PRTB.  Results:   A total of 5701 patients died of PCa, with a median survival from diagnosis of 5.2 years. The overall PRTB utilization rate was 38.6%, with an increasing trend over time. Multiple courses of PRTB were frequent, with 51% of patients receiving ≥2 courses of PRTB. Of the patients who died of PCa (15.2% of the PRTB cohort), 5.4% received PRTB within the last 4 weeks of life, 60% of whom received multiple fractions. Rural areas had a lower referral rate and lower use of PRTB. Patients with longer survival tended to receive multiple courses of treatment. The median survival after the first course of PRTB increased from 8.2 months in 2003 to 2004 to 9.4 months in 2013 to 2014 (P = .04).  Conclusions:   PRTB is only used in a minority of patients dying of PCa. The majority who die of PCa after PRTB do so within a year of their first course. The use of multifractionation was common in the last 4 weeks of life. Survival after first PRTB increased minimally over time, and additional research is required to identify its association with recent changes in practice. The referral rate and PRTB utilization rate differ between rural and nonrural locations, underlying the importance of accessibility and referral for utilization of PRTB.

However, these drugs provide clinical benefit in metastatic disease for only a brief period before drug resistance emerges. One mechanism of drug resistance involves the overexpression of type 5 17-β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (aldo-keto reductase 1C3 or AKR1C3), a major enzyme responsible for the formation of intratumoral androgens that activate the androgen receptor (AR). 3-((4-Nitronaphthalen-1-yl)amino)benzoic acid 1 is a ""first-in-class"" AKR1C3 competitive inhibitor and AR antagonist. Compound 1 was compared in a battery of in vitro studies with structurally related N-naphthyl-aminobenzoates, and AKR1C3 targeted therapeutics e.g. GTx-560 and ASP9521, as well as with R-bicalutamide, enzalutamide and abiraterone acetate. Compound 1 was the only naphthyl derivative that was a selective AKR1C3 inhibitor and AR antagonist in direct competitive binding assays and in AR driven reporter gene assays. GTx-560 displayed weak activity as a direct AR antagonist but had high potency in the AR reporter gene assay consistent with its ability to inhibit the co-activator function of AKR1C3. By contrast ASP9521 did not act as either an AR antagonist or block AR reporter gene activity. Compound 1 was the only compound that showed comparable potency to inhibit AKR1C3 and act as a direct AR antagonist. Compound 1 blocked the formation of testosterone in LNCaP-AKR1C3 cells, and the expression of PSA driven by the AKR1C3 substrate (4-androstene-3,17-dione) and by an AR agonist, 5α-dihydrotestosterone consistent with its bifunctional role. Compound 1 blocked the nuclear translocation of the AR at similar concentrations to enzalutamide and caused disappearance of the AR from cell lysates.

However, the role of PAICS in human lung adenocarcinoma (LADC) requires further study.  Methods:   In this research, the effects of PAICS on the occurrence and prognosis of LADC were evaluated using integrative bioinformatics analyses.  Results:   By employing the bioinformatics analyses of several public databases, PAICS, which is overexpressed in the LADC tissues, was identified as a potential tumor-promoting gene in LADC biology. Several relevant clinical studies indicated that the upregulation of PAICS was statistically correlated with a shorter overall survival time. Moreover, the carcinogenic function of PAICS in LADC was validated by the further protein-protein interactions (PPI) and biological process annotation analysis. Mechanistically, we found that the PAICS methylation level was significantly lower in the LADC tissues compared to the normal lung tissues. Furthermore, using the MEXPRESS web tool, we predicted 15 possible DNA methylation sites in the nucleotide sequences of PAICS, which could explain the alteration in the PAICS expression levels in LADC.  Conclusions:   Our work demonstrates that high levels of PAICS are found in LADC and that this gene may be a potential therapeutic target for this subset of lung cancers. Determining the detailed roles of PAICS in LADC biology may provide useful information for further investigations.""","""['Shuyi Zhou', 'Yuanliang Yan', 'Xi Chen', 'Xiang Wang', 'Shuangshuang Zeng', 'Long Qian', 'Jie Wei', 'Xue Yang', 'Yangying Zhou', 'Zhicheng Gong', 'Zhijie Xu']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Gene""","""['Role and regulation of coordinately expressed de novo purine biosynthetic enzymes PPAT and PAICS in lung cancer.', 'Genome-scale meta-analysis of DNA methylation during progression of lung adenocarcinoma.', 'Prognostic significance of GAD1 overexpression in patients with resected lung adenocarcinoma.', 'Prognostic value of decreased GRK6 expression in lung adenocarcinoma.', 'Expression and Role of PAICS, a De Novo Purine Biosynthetic Gene in Prostate Cancer.', 'Identification of the relationship between single-cell N6-methyladenosine regulators and the infiltrating immune cells in esophageal carcinoma.', 'CRISPR-Cas9 screen reveals a role of purine synthesis for estrogen receptor α activity and tamoxifen resistance of breast cancer cells.', 'Development of a metabolism-related signature for predicting prognosis, immune infiltration and immunotherapy response in breast cancer.', 'Metabolites of De Novo Purine Synthesis: Metabolic Regulators and Cytotoxic Compounds.', 'Pyroptosis: A new insight of non-small-cell lung cancer treatment.']"""

NCPA is able to stimulate Maspin production in PC3 and not in LNCaP cell lines. NCPA blocks the PC3 cell cycle in G1 phase, by inhibiting Cyclin D1 production and induces the apoptosis, therefore interfering with aggressiveness of this androgen-insensitive cell line. Moreover, NCPA is able to induce the expression of Maspin in LNCaP cell line treated with androgen receptor inhibitor, Bicalutamide, and in turn to stimulate the apoptosis of these cells.

Using this strategy, we identified one aptamer (PSA-1) that binds the glycan moiety of PSA with reasonable affinity (a dissociation constant of 177 ± 65 nM). Interestingly, an electrochemical sensor with a sandwich format employing the identified aptamer as a signaling receptor, provides a tool of discriminating human PSA from the unglycosylated protein, with a limit of detection of 0.66 ng/mL. The sensor responds to different levels of PSA in serum, correlating well with chemiluminescence ELISA used in hospitals even with higher potential to discriminate clinically meaningful prostate cancer.

For each localization, the junior or senior physician(s) in charge of pathology delineated the volumes of interest according to their usual practices. Validated indices, including the Dice similarity coefficient, were used to quantify the delineation differences. The anonymized results were presented at two to three annual meetings. A second delineation of the clinical cases was then carried out to quantify homogenization. An evaluation of dosimetry practices was also conducted for prostate cancer. Wilcoxon assay matched data were used.  Results:   Our work showed either satisfactory delineation concordance after the initial assessment or improved delineation concordance. For prostate cancer, the Dice similarity coefficient values were greater than 0.6 initially in two of the three clinical cases. For head and neck cancers, a statistically significant improvement was observed for only one of the clinical target volumes. More than half of the Dice similarity coefficient values were greater than 0.6 in the first comparison. The study of clinical cases of breast cancer allowed a homogenization of the delineation of five of the six lymph node clinical target volumes.

Consequently, androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) that reduces androgen has been applied to treat androgen receptor-mediated PCa for decades. Nevertheless, most ADT treated patients experience relapse due to the development of the castration-resistant PCa. Numerous studies have shown that down-regulation of cellular androgen receptor level, including inhibiting its transcription and promoting its protein degradation, is lethal to PCa cells. Here we report that Aur arrested cell cycle progression and induced apoptosis of PCa cells. Co-inhibition of USP14 and UCHL5 with Aur facilitated the ubiquitination and degradation of androgen receptors in LNcap and 22RV1 PCa cells.

Materials and methods:   A survey among Dutch healthcare providers was conducted to assess healthcare providers' perspectives on patient involvement in decision-making and the value of a decision aid (DA) in the decision-making process. Treatment recommendations were assessed using hypothetical cases in which providers were asked to evaluate their likelihood of pursuing listed treatment options.  Results:   In total, 170 Dutch healthcare providers, including 82 urologists, 31 oncologists, and 57 oncology nurses completed the survey. Sixty-two percent of urologists, 65% of oncologists, and 51% of oncology nurses found that mCRPC patients take a passive role in decision-making and delegate treatment decisions to doctors due to advanced age (p = .45). Yet, 70% of urologists, 71% of oncologists, and 63% of oncology nurses agreed that mCRPC patients should be always involved in decision-making (p = .91). Fifty-two percent of urologists and 55% of oncologists stated that they are inadequately trained to apply SDM in clinical practice. Conversely, only 20% of oncology nurses believed that oncology nurses are inadequately trained. Fifty-four percent of all providers considered a DA suitable to support these patients and their healthcare providers in the decision-making process. All hypothetical cases showed variation in treatment recommendations among providers, with each of the five treatments ranging from extremely likely to extremely unlikely.  Conclusions:   The wide variation of treatment recommendations observed among the multidisciplinary team suggests that mCRPC patients and their healthcare providers may benefit from implementation of informed SDM. Given the perceived passive role of older patients with mCRPC in decision-making, interventions to engage them are needed. With slightly more than half of respondents finding DAs useful to facilitate the decision-making process, development and implementation of a DA would be an interesting field of research.""","""['Isabel B de Angst', 'Paul J M Kil', 'Chris H Bangma', 'Johanna J M Takkenberg']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""J Geriatr Oncol""","""[""Shared decision making in oncology: A model based on patients', health care professionals', and researchers' views."", 'Development and validation of a patient decision aid for prostate Cancer therapy: from paternalistic towards participative shared decision making.', ""Shared Decision-Making in Oncology - A Qualitative Analysis of Healthcare Providers' Views on Current Practice."", 'Optimizing the management of castration-resistant prostate cancer patients: A practical guide for clinicians.', 'Navigating Treatment of Metastatic Castration- Resistant Prostate Cancer: Nursing Perspectives.', 'The Role of Nurse on the Treatment Decision Support for Older People with Cancer: A Systematic Review.', 'Perspectives of Pharmacists on the Structure, Decision-Making, and Communication Practices of Multidisciplinary Cancer Teams in Alabama.', 'Factors Associated with Decision Aid Use in Localized Prostate Cancer.', 'Does greater patient involvement in healthcare decision-making affect malpractice complaints?

Binding of ligands to AR triggers the conformational changes in AR that may affect the recruitment of coactivators and downstream response of AR signaling pathway. Therefore, AR ligands have great potential to treat these diseases. In this study, we searched for novel AR ligands by performing a docking-based virtual screening (VS) on the basis of the crystal structure of the AR ligand binding domain (LBD) in complex with its agonist. A total of 58 structurally diverse compounds were selected and subjected to LBD affinity assay, with five of them (HBP1-3, HBP1-17, HBP1-38, HBP1-51, and HBP1-58) exhibiting strong binding to AR-LBD. The IC50 values of HBP1-51 and HBP1-58 are 3.96 µM and 4.92 µM, respectively, which are even lower than that of enzalutamide (Enz, IC50 = 13.87 µM), a marketed second-generation AR antagonist. Further bioactivity assays suggest that HBP1-51 is an AR agonist, whereas HBP1-58 is an AR antagonist. In addition, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and principal components analysis (PCA) were carried out to reveal the binding principle of the newly-identified AR ligands toward AR. Our modeling results indicate that the conformational changes of helix 12 induced by the bindings of antagonist and agonist are visibly different. In summary, the current study provides a highly efficient way to discover novel AR ligands, which could serve as the starting point for development of new therapeutics for AR-related diseases.""","""['Wenfang Zhou', 'Mojie Duan', 'Weitao Fu', 'Jinping Pang', 'Qin Tang', 'Huiyong Sun', 'Lei Xu', 'Shan Chang', 'Dan Li', 'Tingjun Hou']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Genomics Proteomics Bioinformatics""","""['Conformational dynamics of androgen receptors bound to agonists and antagonists.', 'Molecular Dynamics Simulations Revealed the Regulation of Ligands to the Interactions between Androgen Receptor and Its Coactivator.', 'Discovery of a Novel Androgen Receptor Antagonist Manifesting Evidence to Disrupt the Dimerization of the Ligand-Binding Domain via Attenuating the Hydrogen-Bonding Network Between the Two Monomers.', 'Structures of androgen receptor bound with ligands: advancing understanding of biological functions and drug discovery.', 'Androgen receptor modulators: a review of recent patents and reports (2012-2018).', 'Computationally guided discovery of novel non-steroidal AR-GR dual antagonists demonstrating potency against antiandrogen resistance.', 'The Roles of Androgens in Humans: Biology, Metabolic Regulation and Health.', 'Discovery of novel MIF inhibitors that attenuate microglial inflammatory activation by structures-based virtual screening and in vitro bioassays.', 'Paradoxical androgen receptor regulation by small molecule enantiomers.', 'Integrating Machine Learning-Based Virtual Screening With Multiple Protein Structures and Bio-Assay Evaluation for Discovery of Novel GSK3β Inhibitors.']"""

There was no significant difference between LDR and HDR boosts for National Comprehensive Cancer Network intermediate-risk (AHR 1.05 [0.96, 1.15]; p = 0.32) and high-risk (AHR 1.00 [0.89, 1.12]; p = 0.98) subgroups (p-interaction = 0.55).

The purpose of this study was to determine whether PSA velocity at failure per the Phoenix (nadir + 2 ng/mL) definition is associated with metastasis and prostate cancer-specific mortality (PCSM) in a cohort of patients who experienced PSA failure after partial gland therapy.  Methods:   Between 1997 and 2007, 285 patients with favorable risk prostate cancer underwent partial prostate brachytherapy to the peripheral zone. PSA velocity was calculated for 94 patients who experienced PSA failure per the Phoenix (nadir + 2) definition. Fine and Gray competing risks regression was performed to determine whether PSA velocity and other clinical factors were associated with metastasis and PCSM.  Results:   The median time to PSA failure was 4.2 years (interquartile range: 2.2, 7.9), and the median followup time after PSA failure was 6.5 years (3.5-9.7). Seventeen patients developed metastases, and five experienced PCSM. On multivariate analysis, PSA velocity ≥3.0 ng/mL/year (adjusted hazard ratio 5.97; [2.57, 13.90]; p < 0.001) and PSA nadir (adjusted hazard ratio 0.39; [0.24, 0.64]; p < 0.001) were significantly associated with metastasis. PSA velocity ≥3.0 ng/mL/year was also associated with PCSM (HR 15.3; [1.8, 128.0]; p = 0.012) on univariate analysis.

Material:   This is a multicenter cohort study based on hospital data of prostate biopsies (PB) in 3 health centers between 2001 and 2016. The main objective is to describe the evolution of incident cases of PCa. The secondary objectives are to describe the number of cases per stage of PCa and the distribution of the first treatments.  Results:   In total, 11,491 PB series diagnosed 5927 cases of PCa. The median age was 67 [61-73] years and the median PSA was 7.8 [5.5-13] ng/mL. The number of cases increased until 2006 before decreasing from 2006 to 2013 and then stabilizing from 2013 to 2016. The proportion of incident cases was: (1) for the stable metastatic stage around 8 [7-10]%, (2) for cases with PSA<10 ng/mL increasing from 46% to 75% in 2010 down to 64% in 2016, (3) for the grade 1 group decreasing from 59% to 33 % between 2011 and 2016. The proportion of active surveillance treatment for low-risk cancers increased from 5 to 60% and surgery decreased from 73 to 33%.  Conclusion:   The evolution of the incident cases showed a decrease from 2006 to 2013 and a stability until 2016. The number of cases with PSA<10 ng/mL decreased since 2010 and the proportion of the options of treatment by surveillance increased strongly to the detriment of the surgery for low risks.

Lifestyle guidelines and tools may support lifestyle modification after diagnosis.  Objective:   To determine the feasibility and acceptability of a digital lifestyle intervention among men with prostate cancer.  Design, setting, and participants:   A 12-wk pilot randomized controlled trial among 76 men with clinical stage T1-T3a prostate cancer. Eligibility included Internet access, no contraindications to aerobic exercise, and engaging in four or fewer of eight targeted behaviors at baseline.  Intervention:   Website, Fitbit One, and text messaging to facilitate adoption of eight behaviors: vigorous activity, smoking cessation, and six diet improvements.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Our primary outcomes were feasibility and acceptability based on recruitment and user data, and surveys, respectively. Secondarily, we evaluated the change in eight lifestyle behaviors, and also objective physical activity. Each factor was assigned one point, for an overall ""P8 score"" (range 0-8). Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was conducted. Exploratory outcomes included quality of life, anthropometrics, and circulating biomarkers after 12wk, and behaviors after 1yr.  Results and limitations:   At baseline, men in both arms met a median of three targeted behaviors. Sixty-four men (n=32 per arm) completed the study; 88% completed 12-wk assessments (intervention, 94%; control, 82%). Intervention participants wore their Fitbits a median of 82d (interquartile range [IQR]: 72-83), replied to a median of 71% of text messages (IQR: 57-89%), and visited the website a median of 3d (IQR: 2-5) over 12wk. Median (IQR) absolute changes in the P8 score from baseline to 12wk were 2 (1, 3) for the intervention and 0 (-1, 1) for the control arm. The estimated mean score of the intervention arm was 1.5 (95% confidence interval: 0.7, 2.3) higher than that of the control arm at 12wk (ANCOVA p<0.001). Changes were driven by diet rather than exercise. Limitations include self-reported diet and exercise data.  Conclusions:   Overall, in this novel pilot trial, the intervention was feasible and acceptable to men with prostate cancer. Next steps include improving the intervention to better meet individuals' needs and focusing on increasing physical activity in men not meeting nationally recommended physical activity levels.

Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) can molecularly profile metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer and can influence decision-making, but remains untested in mCSPC.  Objective:   To determine ctDNA abundance at de novo mCSPC diagnosis and whether ctDNA provides complementary clinically relevant information to a prostate biopsy.  Design, setting, and participants:   We collected plasma cell-free DNA (cfDNA) from 53 patients newly diagnosed with mCSPC and, where possible, during treatment. Targeted sequencing was performed on cfDNA and DNA from diagnostic prostate tissue.  Results and limitations:   The median ctDNA fraction was 11% (range 0-84%) among untreated patients but was lower (1.0%, range 0-51%) among patients after short-term (median 22d) androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). TP53 mutations and DNA repair defects were identified in 47% and 21% of the cohort, respectively. The concordance for mutation detection in matched samples was 80%. Combined ctDNA and tissue analysis identified potential driver alterations in 94% of patients, whereas ctDNA or prostate biopsy alone was insufficient in 19 cases (36%). Limitations include the use of a narrow gene panel and undersampling of primary disease by prostate biopsy.  Conclusions:   ctDNA provides additional information to a prostate biopsy in men with de novo mCSPC, but ADT rapidly reduces ctDNA availability. Primary tissue and ctDNA share relevant somatic alterations, suggesting that either is suitable for molecular subtyping in de novo mCSPC. The optimal approach for biomarker development should utilize both a tissue and liquid biopsy at diagnosis, as neither captures clinically relevant somatic alterations in all patients.  Patient summary:   In men with advanced prostate cancer, tumor DNA shed into the bloodstream can be measured via a blood test. The information from this test provides complementary information to a prostate needle biopsy and could be used to guide management strategies.

Objective:   Early-medium-term cancer control and functional outcomes.  Design, setting, and participants:   A prospective registry-based case series of 122 consecutive patients undergoing focal cryotherapy between October 1, 2013, and November 30, 2016, in five UK centres. Median follow-up was 27.8mo [interquartile range (IQR) 19.5-36.7]. A total of 35 patients (28.7%) had National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) high risk and 87 (71.3%) had intermediate risk disease. Risk and zonal stratification included multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) with targeted and systematic biopsies, or transperineal mapping biopsies.  Intervention:   Focal cryoablation of MR-visible tumours.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Follow-up involved prostate-specific antigen (PSA) monitoring, mpMRI, and for-cause biopsies. Primary outcome was failure-free survival (FFS), defined as transition to radical, whole-gland, or systemic therapy, or metastases/death. Secondary outcomes included adverse events and functional outcomes.  Results and limitations:   A total of 80 (65.6%) had anterior ablation, 23 (19.7%) combined posterior and anterior ablation, and two (1.6%) posterior ablation alone (SeedNet or Visual-ICE, BTG plc). Median age was 68.7yr (IQR 64.9-73.8) and preoperative PSA 10.8ng/ml (IQR 7.8-15.6). Overall FFS at 3yr was 90.5% [95% confidence interval (CI) 84.2-97.3]. When stratified for the NCCN risk group, 3-yr outcomes were 84.7% (95% CI 71.4-100) in high risk and 93.3% (95% CI 86.8-100) in intermediate risk. At last follow-up, incontinence defined as any pad use was 0/69 (0%) and erectile dysfunction (defined as erections insufficient for penetration) was 5/31 (16.1%). Limitations include lack of long-term outcomes.  Conclusions:   Focal cryotherapy primarily for anterior intermediate and high-risk prostate cancer results in good rates of cancer control and low rates of treatment-related side effects.

Other than among children (≤15 years) and HIV/AIDs patients, diet-related cancers such as esophageal, colorectal, stomach, prostate and breast appear to predominate among Kenyans in various categories, i.e., young people (15 ≤ 30 years), adults (31 ≤ 65 years), and older people (>65 years). In the past few decades, Kenya has been undergoing nutritional transition characterized by departure from potentially cancer-protective traditional diets (mostly rich in dietary fiber, fruits, and vegetables) to ""western diet"" (rich in charred red/organ meats, fat, cholesterol, sugar, and salt) that poses elevated cancer risks. Other potentially carcinogenic factors that characterize the evolving Kenyan diet include; drinking of illicit and/or excess alcohol, traditional soot-laced sour milk, reuse of frying fats/oils, kerosene-laced meals, aflatoxin and agrochemical contaminated foods.

Therefore, the present study attempted to explore the effect of miR-137 in prostate cancer via regulating NADPH oxidase 4 (NOX4). Initially, microarray analysis was performed to obtain prostate cancer-related differentially expressed genes and miRs that regulated NOX4, followed by detecting the expression of miR-137 and NOX4 and its target relationship. Moreover, PC-3 cells were transfected with small interfering RNA (siNOX4) and miR-137 mimic for exploring the effect of miR-137 on glycolysis, cell proliferation, and apoptosis in prostate cancer by evaluating lactate production, glucose uptake, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production, viability rate, and expression of cleaved caspases 3, 8, and 9, cytochrome c, cleaved poly ADP ribose polymerase (PARP), Bax, and Bcl-2. miR-137 was vital to prostate cancer progression via regulating NOX4. Besides, miR-137 expressed poorly while NOX4 expressed highly in prostate cancer. NOX4 was the target gene of miR-137. Additionally, overexpression of miR-137 and silencing of NOX4 were observed to decrease NOX4 and Bcl-2 protein expression, but increase cleaved caspases 3, 8, and 9, cytochrome c, cleaved-PARP, and Bax protein expression.

In this study, we intended to identify a novel set of differentially expressed gene (DEG) signature that can predict BCR after RP.  Materials/patients:   358 patients after RP with follow-up data were extracted from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), among which 61 patients had undergone BCR. Key DEGs were confirmed by the intersection of GSE35988 and TCGA_PCa dataset, and their gene expression data were also extracted from TCGA_PCa dataset.

Currently, the main therapeutic approaches available for PC are based on the androgen deprivation and on radiotherapy. However, despite these treatments being initially effective in cancer remission, several patients undergo recurrence, developing a most aggressive and resistant PC.Emerging evidence showed that abiraterone acetate drug will reduce PC recurrence by a mechanism independent of the inhibition of Cytochrome P450 17α-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase. Here we describe the involvement in the abiraterone-mediated PC cell death of a particular class of bioactive lipids called sphingolipids (SL). Sphingolipids are components of plasma membrane (PM) that organize macromolecular complexes involved in the control of several signaling pathways including the tumor cell death induced by radiotherapy. Here, we show for the first time that both in androgen-sensitive and insensitive PC cells abiraterone and ionizing radiation induce a reorganization of the plasma membrane SL composition. This event is triggered by activation of the PM-associated glycohydrolases that induce the production of cytotoxic ceramide by the in situ hydrolyses of glycosphingolipids. Taken together our data open a new scenario on the SL involvement in the therapy of PC.""","""['Valentina Murdica', 'Giulia Mancini', 'Nicoletta Loberto', 'Rosaria Bassi', 'Paola Giussani', 'Nadia Di Muzio', 'Chiara Deantoni', 'Alessandro Prinetti', 'Massimo Aureli', 'Sandro Sonnino']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Adv Exp Med Biol""","""['Cytochrome P450 17A1 inhibitor abiraterone attenuates cellular growth of prostate cancer cells independently from androgen receptor signaling by modulation of oncogenic and apoptotic pathways.', 'External beam radiation therapy and abiraterone in men with localized prostate cancer: safety and effect on tissue androgens.', 'N-substituted piperazinopyridylsteroid derivatives as abiraterone analogues inhibit growth and induce pro-apoptosis in human hormone-independent prostate cancer cell lines.', 'Abiraterone acetate in the treatment of prostate cancer.', 'Abiraterone acetate: a novel therapeutic option in hormone-refractory prostate cancer.', 'Plasma Metabolomics for Discovery of Early Metabolic Markers of Prostate Cancer Based on Ultra-High-Performance Liquid Chromatography-High Resolution Mass Spectrometry.', 'Role of SPTSSB-Regulated de Novo Sphingolipid Synthesis in Prostate Cancer Depends on Androgen Receptor Signaling.']"""

The aim of this study is to compare the performance of differing candidate biological reference tissues for standardising T2WI intensity distributions. Fifty-one prostate cancer patients across two centres with different scanners were evaluated using the percentage interpatient coefficient of variation (%interCV) for four different biological references; femoral bone marrow, ischioanal fossa, obturator-internus muscle and bladder urine. The tissue with the highest reproducibility (lowest %interCV) in both centres was used for intensity standardisation of prostate T2WI using three different statistical measures (mean, Z-score, median + Interquartile Range). The performance of different standardisation methods was evaluated from the assessment of image intensity histograms and the percentage normalised root mean square error (%NRSME) of the healthy peripheral zone tissue. Ischioanal fossa as a reference tissue demonstrated the highest reproducibility with %interCV of 18.9 for centre1 and 11.2 for centre2. Using ischioanal fossa for statistical intensity standardisation and the median + Interquartile Range method demonstrated the lowest %NRMSE across centres for healthy peripheral zone tissues.

Here, we reported that the expression of miR-195-5p was decreased in NSCLC tissues and cell lines. Downregulation of miR-195-5p was significantly associated with TNM stage, tumor size and lymph node metastasis. The Kaplan-Meier survival analysis demonstrated that the survival time of NSCLC patients with high expression of miR-195-5p was longer than those with low expression during the 5-year follow up period (p = 0.0410). COX regression analysis indicated that miR-195-5p expression was an independent prognostic indicator for the survival of NSCLC patients (HR = 2.45, 95% CI: 1.53-4.63; p = 0.007). Results of functional analyses revealed that overexpression of miR-195-5p in A549 cells inhibited cell proliferation, induced cell cycle G0/G1 phase arrest and apoptosis using MTT and flow cytometry analysis. Furthermore, bioinformatics and luciferase reporter assays demonstrated that cytokine-induced apoptosis inhibitor 1 (CIAPIN1), an anti-apoptotic molecule was a direct target of miR-195-5p in NSCLC cells. Meta-analysis based on Oncomine database showed CIAPIN1 was significantly up-regulated in human lung cancer tissues.

Confoundingly, the clinical response to Rad-223 is often followed by detrimental relapse and progression, and whether Rad-223 causes tumor-cell directed cytotoxicity in vivo remains unclear. We hypothesized that limited radiation penetrance in situ defines outcome.  Methods:   We tested Rad-223 overall response by PC3 and C4-2B human PCa cell lines in mouse bones (n = 5-18 tibiae per group). Rad-223 efficacy at subcellular resolution was determined by intravital microscopy analysis of dual-color fluorescent PC3 cells (n = 3-4 mice per group) in tissue-engineered bone constructs. In vivo data were fed into an in silico model to predict Rad-223 effectiveness in lesions of different sizes (1-27, 306 initial cells; n = 10-100 simulations) and the predictions validated in vivo by treating PCa tumors of varying sizes in bones (n = 10-14 tibiae per group). Statistical tests were performed by two-sided Student t test or by one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey's post-hoc test.  Results:   Rad-223 (385 kBq/kg) delayed the growth (means [SD]; comparison with control-treated mice) of PC3 (6.7 × 105[4.2 × 105] vs 2.8 × 106 [2.2 × 106], P = .01) and C4-2B tumors in bone (7.7 × 105 [4.0 × 105] vs 3.5 × 106 [1.3 × 106], P < .001). Cancer cell lethality in response to Rad-223 (385 kBq/kg) was profound but zonally confined along the bone interface compared with the more distant tumor core, which remained unperturbed (day 4; 13.1 [2.3%] apoptotic cells, 0-100 µm distance from bone vs 3.6 [0.2%], >300 µm distance; P = .01).In silico simulations predicted greater efficacy of Rad-223 on single-cell lesions (eradication rate: 88.0%) and minimal effects on larger tumors (no eradication, 16.2% growth reduction in tumors of 27 306 cells), as further confirmed in vivo for PC3 and C4-2B tumors.  Conclusions:   Micro-tumors showed severe growth delay or eradication in response to Rad-223, whereas macro-tumors persisted and expanded.

Drug resistance and toxic side effects limit the therapeutic efficacy of osteosarcoma. Therefore, it is urgent to develop new drugs for osteosarcoma treatment. Muscarinic 3 (M3) acetylcholine receptor (AChR) has been demonstrated in nonneurocrest-derived malignancies such as colon, prostate, lung, and ovarian carcinomas. Hence, targeted regulation of M3 AChR may be a possible mechanism for treating tumors. Aclidinium bromide has anti-tumoral properties in several tumors, namely gastric cancer and glioma. In this study, we intended to investigate whether aclidinium bromide, a novel M3 AChR antagonist, had effects on osteosarcoma cells proliferation and migration.  Patients and methods:   The viability of U2 OS cells was detected by cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) assay. The migration and invasion capabilities were measured by transwell invasion and migration assays. The cell apoptosis rate was tested by Annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)/Propidum iodide (PI) staining and flow cytometry. Key apoptosis-related and phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (AKT) signaling pathway-associated were assessed by Western blot analysis.  Results:   Aclidinium bromide markedly decreased the OD value of U2 OS cells 48 h and 72 h after treatment. The number of positive crystal violet staining cells significantly decreased after treatment with aclidinium bromide. Treatment with aclidinium bromide significantly increased cell apoptosis rate, accompanied by the expression of anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 decreased, the expression of pro-apoptotic protein Active caspase-3 and Bax significantly increased in U2 OS cells treated with aclidinium bromide. Additionally, aclidinium bromide suppressed the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway in U2 OS cells.

Here, we aim to identify the molecular mechanisms underlying the N-Myc-driven therapeutic resistance and provide new therapeutic targets for those N-Myc overexpressed NEPC/CRPC.  Methods:   N-Myc overexpressing stable cell lines for LNCaP and C4-2 were generated by lentivirus infection. ADT-induced senescence was measured by SA-β-gal staining in LNCaP cells in vitro and in LNCaP xenograft tumors in vivo. Migration, cell proliferation and colony formation assays were used to measure the cellular response after overexpressing N-Myc or perturbing the miR-421/ATM pathway. CRISPR-Cas9 was used to knock out ATM in C4-2 cells and MTS cell viability assay was used to evaluate the drug sensitivity of N-Myc overexpressing C4-2 cells in response to Enzalutamide and ATM inhibitor Ku60019 respectively or in combination.  Results:   N-Myc overexpression suppressed ATM expression through upregulating miR-421 in LNCaP cells. This suppression alleviated the ADT-induced senescence in vitro and in vivo. Surprisingly, N-Myc overexpression upregulated ATM expression in C4-2 cells and this upregulation promoted migration and invasion of prostate cancer cells. Further, the N-Myc-induced ATM upregulation in C4-2 cells rendered the cells resistance to Enzalutamide, and inhibition of ATM by CRISPR-Cas9 knockout or ATM inhibitor Ku60019 re-sensitized them to Enzalutamide.  Conclusions:   N-Myc differentially regulating miR-421/ATM pathway contributes to ADT resistance and Enzalutamide resistance development respectively.

With 3.8 million men living with the disease worldwide, the challenge is creating accessible intervention approaches that lead to sustainable lifestyle changes. We carried out a phase II feasibility study of a lifestyle intervention delivered by nine community pharmacies in the United Kingdom to inform a larger efficacy study. Qualitative interviews explored how men experienced the intervention, and these data are presented here.  Methods:   Community pharmacies delivered a multicomponent lifestyle intervention to 116 men with prostate cancer. The intervention included a health, strength, and fitness assessment, immediate feedback, lifestyle prescription with telephone support, and reassessment 12 weeks later. Three months after receiving the intervention, 33 participants took part in semistructured telephone interviews.  Results:   Our framework analysis identified how a teachable moment can be created by a community pharmacy intervention. There was evidence of this when men's self-perception was challenged and coupled to a positive interaction with a pharmacist. Our findings highlight the social context of behaviour change with men identifying how their lifestyle choices were negotiated within their household. There was a ripple effect as lifestyle behaviours made a positive impact on friends and family.  Conclusions:   The teachable moment is not a serendipitous opportunity but can be created by an intervention. Our study adds insight into how community pharmacists can support cancer survivors to make positive lifestyle behaviour changes and suggests a role for doing rather than just telling.""","""['Karen Poole', 'Jane Ogden', 'Sophie Gasson', 'Agnieszka Lemanska', 'Fiona Archer', 'Bruce Griffin', 'John Saxton', 'Karen Lyons', 'Sara Faithfull']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Psychooncology""","""['Barriers and facilitators to healthy lifestyle and acceptability of a dietary and physical activity intervention among African Caribbean prostate cancer survivors in the UK: a qualitative study.', 'Community pharmacy lifestyle intervention to increase physical activity and improve cardiovascular health of men with prostate cancer: a phase II feasibility study.', 'Changes in lifestyle among prostate cancer survivors: A nationwide population-based study.', 'Facilitators and barriers to participation in lifestyle modification for men with prostate cancer: A scoping review.', ""The Project to Extend Healthy Life Expectancy by Having Fun, in Collaboration with Kobe Women's University (KWU).""]"""

Repeatability of AIF curve characteristics and TK parameters was assessed with the within-subject coefficient of variation (wCV).  Results:   The wCV for peak height and full width at half maximum for AIFCOMPLEX (7% and 8%) indicated an improved repeatability compared to AIFMAGN (12% and 12%) and AIFPHASE (12% and 7%). This translated in lower wCV values for Ktrans (11%) with AIFCOMPLEX in comparison to AIFMAGN (24%) and AIFPHASE (15%). For kep , the wCV was 16% with AIFMAGN , 13% with AIFPHASE , and 13% with AIFCOMPLEX .

Our group has been interested in two immunohistochemical (IHC) markers previously shown to be downregulated in particularly aggressive primary prostatic carcinomas: CHD1 and MAP3K7. Here we assess protein expression in clinically-relevant CNS metastases. We also assessed how these two markers correlated with the most common genetic alteration in prostate cancer: TMPRSS2 fusion to ERG (40-60% of carcinomas at the primary site), which places ERG expression under the control of the androgen-regulated TMPRSS2 gene, increasing expression.  Design:   Database query, 2000-2016, identified 16 metastases to dura, 5 to brain parenchyma.  Results:   Four of five intraparenchymal metastases and 15/16 informative dural-based metastases were ERG-negative (90.5% overall). There was reduced expression of CHD1 in 8/21 and reduced MAP3K7 in 17/21 cases; 7/19 (37%) ERG-negative metastases had dual low expression of CHD1/MAP3K7. ERG-positive cases had high expression of one or both markers.  Conclusion:   Metastatic prostatic carcinoma to CNS demonstrates expression patterns consistent with particularly aggressive behavior.

In total, 130,342 men included in the health checkup cohort in 2009 were divided into two groups according to the presence of prostate cancer. The prevalence of prostate cancer from 2009 to 2013 was cumulatively calculated from 2003. A generalized estimating equation was used to assess the effect of MetS and its component on the prevalence of prostate cancer after adjusting for other variables.  Results:   Prostate cancer was present in 2369 men (1.8%) in 2009. The prevalence of prostate cancer was significantly higher in patients with MetS than in those without MetS throughout the entire follow-up duration. Multivariable analysis showed that in addition to year at evaluation and age, the presence of MetS was associated with an increased prevalence of prostate cancer. Alcohol consumption and smoking levels were negatively associated with the prevalence of prostate cancer. Among MetS components, decreased high density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterolemia and central obesity were associated with an increased prevalence of prostate cancer after adjusting for other variables.  Conclusion:   MetS and its components, especially decreased HDL-cholesterol levels and central obesity, were related to the increased prevalence of prostate cancer.

In the present study, the biological function of miR-106a in the human prostate carcinoma and the associated regulatory mechanisms were investigated. miR-106a was significantly upregulated in human prostate cancer tissues when compared with normal tissues (P<0.05), and the overexpression of miR-106a was identified to promote PC-3 cell growth. Additionally, miRNA-106a inhibition significantly suppressed PC-3 cell growth. Furthermore, it was observed that the phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) expression level was negatively associated with miR-106a expression level, and miRNA-106a directly targeted PTEN in the PC-3 cells. PTEN overexpression has a similar effect on PC-3 cell growth as loss of miR-106a.

The aim of this study was to define the continence status in patients where rhabdosphincter was included in the vesicourethral anastomosis.  Materials and methods:   Between November 2004 and September 2010, 90 cases who underwent RRP by the same surgeon in our clinic were taken into the study. In all cases vesicourethral anastomosis was performed include the rhabdosphincter. The anastomosis was performed with mean 2.9 (0-7) interrupted no 2-0 vicryl sutures, depending on the angulation of symphysis pubis and pelvic cavity. Pad test was performed to all patients at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months postoperatively. We defined patients as 'continent' when they no need pad, as 'mild incontinence' when they use only one pad daily, as 'moderate incontinence' when they use two or three pads daily and as 'severe incontinence' when they use more than three pads daily.  Results:   Preoperative total PSA value was 12.2 ng/ml (range: 2.7-84 ng/ml). Preoperative prostate biopsy results were found that Gleason scores were 5, 6, 7 and 8 in 7, 53, 21, 9 patients, respectively.

They established the segmented culture technique for localizing the infections in the males to the urethra, the bladder, or the prostate and to differentiate the main categories of prostatitis. Such categories with slight modifications are still used according to the NIH classification: acute bacterial prostatitis, chronic bacterial prostatitis, Chronic Pelvic Pain Syndrome (CPPS) and asymptomatic prostatitis. Prostatic inflammation is considered an important factor in influencing both prostatic growth and progression of symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia and prostatitis. Chronic inflammation/neuroinflammation is a result of a deregulated acute phase response of the innate immune system affecting surrounding neural tissue at molecular, structural and functional levels. Clinical observations suggest that chronic inflammation correlates with chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CP/CPPS) and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and an history of clinical chronic prostatitis significantly increases the odds for prostate cancer. The NIHNIDDK classification based on the use of the microbiological 4- glasses localization test or simplified 2-glasses test, is currently accepted worldwide. The UPOINT system identifies groups of clinicians with homogeneous clinical presentation and is used to recognize phenotypes to be submitted to specific treatments. The UPOINTS algorithm implemented the original UPOINT adding to the urinary domains (U), psycho-social (P), organspecific (O), infection (I), neurological (N), muscle tension and tenderness (T) a further domain related to sexuality (S). In fact sexual dysfunction (erectile, ejaculatory, libido loss) has been described in 46-92% of cases with a high impact on the quality of life of patients with CP/CPPS. Prostatic ultrasound represents the most popular imaging test in the work-up of either acute and chronic prostatitis although no specific hypo-hyperechoic pattern has been clearly associated with chronic bacterial prostatitis and CPPS. Use of a digital-processing software to calculate the extension of prostatic calcification area at ultrasound demonstrated a higher percentage of prostatic calcification in patients with chronic bacterial prostatitis. Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging (mpMRI) is the current state-of-the art imaging modality in the assessment of patients with prostate cancer although a variety of benign conditions, including inflammation, may mimic prostate cancer and act as confounding factors in the discrimination between neoplastic and non-neoplastic lesions. Bacteria can infect prostate gland by: ascending the urethra, reflux of urine into the prostatic ducts, direct inoculation of bacteria through inserted biopsy needles or hematogenous seeding. Enterobacteriaceae are the predominant pathogens in acute and chronic bacterial prostatitis, but an increasing role of Enterococci has been reported. Many strains of these uropathogens exhibit the ability to form biofilm and multidrug- resistance. Sexually Transmitted Infections (STI) agents, in particular Chlamydia trachomatis and Mycoplasma genitalium, have been also considered as causative pathogens of chronic bacterial prostatitis. On the contrary the effective role in genital diseases of other ""genital mycoplasmas"" is still a much debated issue. Sexually Transmitted Infections agents should be investigated by molecular methods in both patient and sexual partner. ""Next generation"" investigations, such as cytokine analysis, cytological typing of immune cells could help stratifying the immune response. Epigenetic dysregulation of inflammatory factors should be investigated according to systemic and compartment-specific signals. The search for biomarkers should also include evaluation of hormonal pathways, as measurement of estrogen levels in semen. Antimicrobials are the first line agents for the treatment of bacterial prostatitis. The success of antimicrobial treatment depends on the antibacterial activity and the pharmacokinetic characteristics of the drug which must reach high concentrations in prostate secretion and prostate tissue. Acute bacterial prostatitis can be a serious infection with a potential risk for urosepsis For iInitial treatment of severely ill patients, intravenous administration of high doses of bactericidal antimicrobials, such as broad-spectrum penicillins, third-generation cephalosporins or fluoroquinolones, is recommended in combination with an aminoglycoside. Use of piperacillin-tazobactam and meropenem is justified in presence of multiresistant gramnegative pathogens. The antibiotic treatment of chronic prostatitis is currently based on the use of fluoroquinolones that, given for 2 to 4 weeks, cured about 70% of men with chronic bacterial prostatitis. For the treatment of Chlamydial prostatitis macrolides were shown to be more effective than fluoroquinolones, whereas no differences were observed in microbiological and clinical efficacy between macrolides and tetracyclines for the treatment of infections caused by intracellular pathogens. Aminoglycosides and fosfomycin could be considered as a therapeutic alternative for the treatment of quinolone resistant prostatitis. Use of alpha-blockers in CP/CPPS patients with urinary symptoms and analgesics +/- non steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID), in presence of pain demonstrated a reduction of symptoms reduction and an improvement of quality of life, although long term use of NSAID is limited by side effect profile. However, the multimodal therapeutic regimen by contemporary use of alphablockers, antibiotics and anti-inflammatory showed a better control of prostatitis symptoms than single drug treatment. Novel therapeutic substances for the treatment of pain, such as the cannabinoid anandamide would be highly interesting to test. An alternative for the treatment of chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome is phytotherapy, as primary therapy or in association with other drugs. Quercetin, pollen extract, extract of Serenoa repens and other mixtures of herbal extracts showed a positive effect on symptoms and quality of life without side effects. The association of CP/CPPS with alterations of intestinal function has been described. Diet has its effects on inflammation by regulation of the composition of intestinal flora and direct action on the intestinal cells (sterile inflammation). Intestinal bacteria (microbiota) interacts with food influencing the metabolic, immune and inflammatory response of the organism. The intestinal microbiota has protective function against pathogenic bacteria, metabolic function by synthesis of vitamins, decomposition of bile acids and production of trophic factors (butyrate), and modulation of the intestinal immune system. The alteration of the microbiota is called ""dysbiosis"" causing invasive intestinal diseases pathologies (leaky gut syndrome and food intolerances, irritable bowel syndrome or chronic inflammatory bowel diseases) and correlating with numerous systemic diseases including acute and chronic prostatitis. Administration of live probiotics bacteria can be used to regulate the balance if intestinal flora. Sessions of hydrocolontherapy can represent an integration to this therapeutic approach. Finally, microbiological examination of sexual partners can offer supplementary information for treatment.""","""['Vittorio Magri', 'Matteo Boltri', 'Tommaso Cai', 'Roberto Colombo', 'Salvatore Cuzzocrea', 'Pieter De Visschere', 'Rosanna Giuberti', 'Clara Maria Granatieri', 'Maria Agnese Latino', 'Gaetano Larganà', 'Christian Leli', 'Giorgio Maierna', 'Valentina Marchese', 'Elisabetta Massa', 'Alberto Matteelli', 'Emanuele Montanari', 'Giuseppe Morgia', 'Kurt G Naber', 'Vaia Papadouli', 'Gianpaolo Perletti', 'Nektaria Rekleiti', 'Giorgio I Russo', 'Alessandra Sensini', 'Konstantinos Stamatiou', 'Alberto Trinchieri', 'Florian M E Wagenlehner']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Arch Ital Urol Androl""","""['Multimodal therapy for category III chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome in UPOINTS phenotyped patients.', 'Antimicrobial therapy for chronic bacterial prostatitis.', 'Chronic prostatitis: management strategies.', 'Influence of infection on the distribution patterns of NIH-Chronic Prostatitis Symptom Index scores in patients with chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CP/CPPS).', 'Common Questions About Chronic Prostatitis.', 'Mechanism of Androgen-Independent Stromal Proliferation in Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia.', 'The Efficacy of Flogofilm® in the Treatment of Chronic Bacterial Prostatitis as an Adjuvant to Antibiotic Therapy: A Randomized Prospective Trial.', 'Prostatitis: A Review.', 'Microbial etiology of bacterial chronic prostatitis: systematic review.', 'New insights into the interplay between intestinal flora and bile acids in inflammatory bowel disease.']"""

Through pan-NET analyses, we identified ONECUT2 as a candidate master transcriptional regulator of poorly differentiated NETs. ONECUT2 ectopic expression in prostate adenocarcinoma synergizes with hypoxia to suppress androgen signaling and induce neuroendocrine plasticity. ONEUCT2 drives tumor aggressiveness in NEPC, partially through regulating hypoxia signaling and tumor hypoxia. Specifically, ONECUT2 activates SMAD3, which regulates hypoxia signaling through modulating HIF1α chromatin-binding, leading NEPC to exhibit higher degrees of hypoxia compared to prostate adenocarcinomas. Treatment with hypoxia-activated prodrug TH-302 potently reduces NEPC tumor growth.

Methods: Labeling of 18F-AlF-PSMA-11 via 18F-AlF-complexation was performed as described by Boschi et al. and Malik et al. with minor modifications. Several conditions for the quality control of the labeling of 18F-AlF-PSMA-11 via 18F-AlF-complexation were evaluated to characterize the influence of ethanol, acetonitrile, and trifluoroacetic acid on the stability of the labeled product. Internalization kinetics of 18F-AlF-PSMA-11 were compared with those of 68Ga-PSMA-11 using PSMA-expressing LNCaP tumor cells. Biodistribution of 18F-AlF-PSMA-11 (0.26 nmol/mouse, 8-9 MBq/mouse) in male BALB/c nude mice with PSMA-expressing subcutaneous LS174T-PSMA tumors was compared with that of 68Ga-PSMA-11 at 1 and 2 h after injection. In addition, 18F-AlF-PSMA-11 PET/CT and 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT imaging were performed at 1 and 2 h after injection. Results: In contrast to 68Ga-PSMA-11, 18F-AlF-PSMA-11 was not stable in water (radiochemical purity was 64.5% immediately after purification and 52.7% at 120 min after purification). 18F-AlF-PSMA-11 remained relatively stable in 25 mM NH4OAc, pH 6.9, and radiochemical purity decreased from 98.5% at purification to 96.3%, 94.7%, and 92.5% at 60, 120, and 180 min after purification. In vitro, the 18F- and 68Ga-labeled compounds showed rapid internalization in LS174T-PSMA cells. The highest tumor uptake (percentage injected dose [%ID]) was observed at 2 h after injection (10.8 ± 2.3 %ID/g and 7.9 ± 1.3 %ID/g for 18F-AlF-PSMA-11 and 68Ga-PSMA-11, respectively [P > 0.05]). Renal tracer uptake peaked at 2 h after injection (43.5 ± 5.7 %ID/g and 105.8 ± 13.8 %ID/g for 18F-AlF-PSMA-11 and 68Ga-PSMA-11, respectively, P < 0.05). Bone uptake of 18F-AlF-PSMA-11 was 3.3 ± 0.6 at 1 h after injection and 5.0 ± 0.6 %ID/g at 2 h after injection and was dependent on the radiochemical purity at the time of injection. Bone uptake of 68Ga-PSMA-11 reached 0.1 ± 0.0 %ID/g at 1 and 2 h after injection. PSMA-expressing xenografts could be visualized using both 68Ga-PSMA-11- and 18F-AlF-PSMA-11 PET/CT. Conclusion: 18F-AlF-PSMA-11 using direct labeling with aluminum fluoride can be produced in NH4OAc, pH 6.9; shows a high internalization rate; and visualizes PSMA-expressing tumors with similar tumor uptake. Lower kidney uptake than with 68Ga-PSMA-11 may be advantageous for tumor detection.

Despite their common clinical use, little is known about the effects of β-blockers on free intracellular calcium (Ca2+ i), an important cytosolic second messenger and a key regulator of cell function. We investigated the role of four chemical analogs, commonly prescribed β-blockers (atenolol, metoprolol, propranolol, and sotalol), on Ca2+ i release and whole-cell currents in mammalian cancer cells (PC3 prostate cancer and MCF7 breast cancer cell lines). We discovered that only propranolol activated free Ca2+ i release with distinct kinetics, whereas atenolol, metoprolol, and sotalol did not. The propranolol-induced Ca2+ i release was significantly inhibited by the chelation of extracellular calcium with ethylene glycol tetraacetic acid (EGTA) and by dantrolene, an inhibitor of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) ryanodine receptor channels, and it was completely abolished by 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate, an inhibitor of the ER inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) receptor channels. Exhaustion of ER stores with 4-chloro-m-cresol, a ryanodine receptor activator, or thapsigargin, a sarco/ER Ca2+ ATPase inhibitor, precluded the propranolol-induced Ca2+ i release. Finally, preincubation of cells with sotalol or timolol, nonselective blockers of β-adrenoceptors, also reduced the Ca2+ i release activated by propranolol. Our results show that different β-blockers have differential effects on whole-cell currents and free Ca2+ i release and that propranolol activates store-operated Ca2+ i release via a mechanism that involves calcium-induced calcium release and putative downstream transducers such as IP3 The differential action of class II antiarrhythmics on Ca2+ i release may have implications on the pharmacology of these drugs.""","""['Marta Reyes-Corral', 'Naja M Sørensen', 'Christopher Thrasivoulou', 'Prokar Dasgupta', 'Jonathan F Ashmore', 'Aamir Ahmed']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""J Pharmacol Exp Ther""","""['β adrenergic receptor/cAMP/PKA signaling contributes to the intracellular Ca2+ release by tentacle extract from the jellyfish Cyanea capillata.', 'Store-Independent Orai Channels Regulated by STIM.', 'Intracellular Calcium Mobilization in Response to Ion Channel Regulators via a Calcium-Induced Calcium Release Mechanism.', 'Dynamic imaging of endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ concentration in insulin-secreting MIN6 Cells using recombinant targeted cameleons: roles of sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA)-2 and ryanodine receptors.', 'Sarco-Endoplasmic Reticulum Calcium Release Model Based on Changes in the Luminal Calcium Content.', 'Beta-blockers exert potent anti-tumor effects in cutaneous and uveal melanoma.']"""

Currently, pretreatment local staging is performed with MRI, while the gold standard is represented by histopathological analysis after radical prostatectomy. Texture analysis (TA) is a quantitative postprocessing method for data extraction, while machine learning (ML) employs artificial intelligence algorithms for data classification. Purpose of this study was to assess whether ML algorithms could predict histopathological EPE using TA features extracted from unenhanced MR images.  Materials and methods:   Index lesions from biparametric MRI examinations of 39 patients with prostate cancer who underwent radical prostatectomy were manually segmented on both T2-weighted images and ADC maps for TA data extraction. Combinations of different feature selection methods and ML classifiers were tested, and their performance was compared to a baseline accuracy reference.  Results:   The classifier showing the best performance was the Bayesian Network, using the dataset obtained by the Subset Evaluator feature selection method. It showed a percentage of correctly classified instances of 82%, an area under the curve of 0.88, a weighted true positive rate of 0.82 and a weighted true negative rate of 0.80.

Multiparametric (mp) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) could allow the assessment of tumor extension and of its relationship with external structures. Aim of this study is to propose a new radiological Wheeler (rW) staging system applied to mp-MRI, based on the pathologic staging system (pW) for the local assessment of PCa.  Methods:   This retrospective single-center multi-reader study included consecutive patients with PCa and preoperative mp-MRI, who underwent non-nerve sparing radical prostatectomy. Three radiologists reported on all examinations and classified each selected lesion according to imaging criteria following rW. Whole-mount histological sections were used as the reference standard. An experienced pathologist classified the extent of prostatic capsular invasion of each PCa according to the pW. Each histological section was scanned for comparison with mp-MRI findings. The rate of PCa correctly classified by radiologists using the pW was assessed. To evaluate the accuracy of mp-MRI in the discrimination between T2 and T3 PCa, the AUC was computed.  Results:   One-hundred and five patients with a total of 195 PCa foci were included in the study. 130/195 tumors with a clear overlap between mp-MRI and surgical specimens were selected. The sensitivity of the most experienced reader was lower than that of the other two readers (48.6% vs. 68.6% and 62.9%, P>0.09) while specificity and PPV were higher (95.8% vs. 79.0% and 57.9%, P<0.001; 81.0% vs. 54.6% and 35.5%, P<0.041; respectively).

In the present study, we report a pharmacokinetic (PK) herb-nutrient interaction between calcitriol and aPPD in mice. A liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC/MS) method was developed using 4-phenyl-1,2,4-triazoline-3,5-dione derivatizing agent and we subsequently used the method to quantitate calcitriol in mouse serum. The limit of quantitation was 0.01 ng/ml which is approximately 100 fold lower than the previously reported assay from our laboratory. Calcitriol PK parameters were determined in non-tumor-bearing or C4-2 human prostate tumor-bearing nude mice following oral co-administration of calcitriol either alone or in combination with aPPD. Mice were pretreated with oral aPPD (70 mg/kg) or vehicle control twice daily for seven consecutive days, followed by a single oral dose of 4 μg/kg calcitriol alone or in combination with aPPD. Our PK results demonstrated that co-administration of calcitriol with aPPD (following pre-treatment with vehicle for seven days) resulted in a 35% increase in the area under the curve (AUC0-24 h) and a 41% increase in the maximum serum concentration (Cmax) compared to the calcitriol only group. aPPD therefore significantly increased calcitriol serum exposure. We also saw a reduction in the time required to reach Cmax. In contrast, calcitriol PK in mice co-administered with calcitriol and aPPD as well as those pretreated seven consecutive days with aPPD was no different than that determined for the mice that received vehicle for seven days as pre-treatment. Co-administration of calcitriol with aPPD therefore could increase health benefits of vitamin D3, however any increased risk of hypercalcemia, resulting from this combination approach, requires further investigation. Lastly, we surmise that a cytochrome P450 inhibition-based mechanism may contribute to the observed PK interaction.""","""['Mohamed Ben-Eltriki', 'Mohamed Hassona', 'Gray Meckling', 'Hans Adomat', 'Subrata Deb', 'Emma S Tomlinson Guns']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Eur J Pharm Sci""","""['Anti-Tumor Effects of Ginsenoside 20(S)-Protopanaxadiol and 1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D3 Combination in Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'A novel oral dosage formulation of the ginsenoside aglycone protopanaxadiol exhibits therapeutic activity against a hormone-insensitive model of prostate cancer.', 'Ginsenoside-mediated blockade of 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 inactivation in human liver and intestine in vitro.', '1alpha(OH)D3 One-alpha-hydroxy-cholecalciferol--an active vitamin D analog.

Materials and methods:   Urine samples from 440 patients undergoing surveillance for NMIBC were prospectively collected at five centres and evaluated using the Bladder EpiCheck test (NCT02647112). A multivariable nomogram and decision-curve analysis (DCA) were used to evaluate the impact of Bladder EpiCheck on decision-making when used in routine clinical practice. The test was designed to exclude recurrent disease.  Results:   Data from 357 patients were available for analysis. The test had a specificity of 88% (95% confidence interval [CI] 84-91), a negative predictive value (NPV) of 94.4% (95% CI 91-97) for the detection of any cancer and an NPV of 99.3% for the detection of high-grade cancer. In multivariable analysis, positive Bladder EpiCheck results were independently associated with any and high-grade disease recurrence (odds ratio [OR] 18.1, 95% CI 8.7-40.2; P < 0.001 and OR 78.3, 95% CI 19.2-547; P < 0.001). The addition of Bladder EpiCheck to standard variables improved its predictive ability for any and high-grade disease recurrence by a difference of 16% and 22%, respectively (area under the curve 85.9% and 96.1% for any and high-grade cancer, respectively). DCA showed an improvement in the net benefit relative to cystoscopy over a large threshold of probability, resulting in a significant reduction in unnecessary investigations.

Patients and methods:   We evaluated 600 consecutive RALP procedures, performed by a single surgeon, including 300 procedures performed at 6 mmHg and the previous 300 performed at 15 mmHg. We compared preoperative patient characteristics and outcomes including pain scores, morphine equivalents, length of stay (LOS) and complications. After implementing the adjustment to 6 mmHg, we began allowing same-day discharge in patients meeting established criteria.  Results:   All 300 consecutive RALP procedures were completed at 6 mmHg with no pressure adjustments for the entirety of the case. There were no significant differences in patient or pathological features between groups. Body mass index was 19.5-44.3 kg/m2 in the 6 mmHg group. The mean operating time was 10.5-min longer and mean estimated blood loss 20-mL higher at 6 mmHg, with no blood transfusions in either group. The mean LOS was shorter in the 6-mmHg group (0.57 vs 1.00 days; P < 0.001), with 43.3% of patients in the 6-mmHg group discharged home the day of surgery. There were no differences in morphine equivalents or maximum pain scores in the first 4 h after surgery, but there was a small improvement (18%) in pain scores at 5-12 h postoperatively (3.2 vs 3.9; P < 0.001).

Similarly, nitric oxide (NO) is an important endogenous free radical with an antimicrobial effect and toxicity toward cancer cells that plays pivotal roles in several processes. In this work, biogenic AgNPs were prepared using green tea extract and the principles of green chemistry, and the NO donor S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO) was prepared by the nitrosation of glutathione. To enhance the potentialities of GSNO and AgNPs in biomedical applications, the NO donor and metallic nanoparticles were individually or simultaneously incorporated into polymeric solid films of poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) and poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG). The resulting solid nanocomposites were characterized by several techniques, and the diffusion profiles of GSNO and AgNPs were investigated. The results demonstrated the formation of homogeneous PVA/PEG solid films containing GSNO and nanoscale AgNPs that are distributed in the polymeric matrix. PVA/PEG films containing AgNPs demonstrated a potent antibacterial effect against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial strains. GSNO-containing PVA/PEG films demonstrated toxicity toward human cervical carcinoma and human prostate cancer cell lines. Interestingly, the incorporation of AgNPs in PVA/PEG/GSNO films had a superior effect on the decrease of cell viability of both cancer cell lines, compared with cells treated with films containing GSNO or AgNPs individually.

Medical misdiagnosis rates remain high because there are no specific clinical symptoms or imaging features, which decreases patient survival. We report a case of prostatic urethral cancer confirmed by transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy because of an abnormal digital rectal exam.  Patient concerns:   A 55-year-old man was referred to our hospital due to lower urinary tract symptoms that lasted for 5 years.  Diagnoses and interventions:   On digital rectal examination, a hard and enlarged prostate was detected. Computed tomography, bone scintigraphy, and magnetic resonance imaging indicated benign prostatic hyperplasia. The patient underwent transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy. From the histopathological examination and immunohistochemical markers, a diagnosis of high-grade prostatic urothelial carcinoma was made. We excluded the possibility of urothelial cancer originating in the bladder lining after transurethral resection of the bladder. Radical cystoprostatectomy was performed, followed by 6 cycles of cisplatin and gemcitabine chemotherapy. Postoperative pathology showed primary urothelial carcinoma of the prostate.  Outcomes:   The patient recovered smoothly after surgery. After a 6-month follow-up, no evidence of local recurrence or metastatic disease was found.  Lessons:   This case reminds clinicians that, for middle-aged men with suspicious digital rectal examinations, a diagnosis of prostatic urothelial carcinoma should be considered.

Patients were separated into three groups, based on different volumes of tissue resected during TURP (5-15 g, 15-50 g, >50 g).Of the 49,206 patients, 633 patients were diagnosed with new onset of prostate cancer following TURP. Older age was a risk factor contributing to the onset of prostate cancer (P = .0196) and different volumes of tissue resected were significantly related to the incidence of postoperative prostate cancer (P = .0399). The group of patients with a smaller volume of prostate resected had a higher risk of prostate cancer with a hazard ratio (HR) of 1.221 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.035, 1.440; P = .0179). However, the risk in the group of patients with a larger volume of prostrate resected was not significantly different, with an HR of 1.277 (95% CI: 0.981, 1662; P = .0690). The incidence of prostate cancer in Taiwanese males over 30 years of age has previously been reported to be 0.0560%; the mean incidence was 0.2282% in our present study.This study shows that BPH patients who had a smaller volume of tissue resected during TURP show a higher incidence of prostate cancer postoperatively. Currently, no clear mechanism is shown to demonstrate the relationship between resected prostate weight and the incidence of tumors. Patients with a larger prostate volume might have lower urinary tract symptoms earlier and then seek professional help. It is possible that surgical procedures might remove the potentially carcinogenic prostate tissue and thus reduce the risk of an aggressive tumor developing in the future.""","""['Fu-Chao Liu', 'Kuo-Chun Hua', 'Jr-Rung Lin', 'See-Tong Pang', 'Huang-Ping Yu']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Medicine (Baltimore)""","""['Transurethral diode laser enucleation versus transurethral electrovaporization resection of the prostate for benign prostatic hyperplasia with different prostate volumes.', 'Aquablation of the prostate for the treatment of lower urinary tract symptoms in men with benign prostatic hyperplasia.', '""Finding the needle in a haystack"": oncologic evaluation of patients treated for LUTS with holmium laser enucleation of the prostate (HoLEP) versus transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP).', ""Examining the 'gold standard': a comparative critical analysis of three consecutive decades of monopolar transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) outcomes."", 'A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis of Functional Outcomes and Complications Following Transurethral Procedures for Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms Resulting from Benign Prostatic Obstruction: An Update.', 'Current Trends in Incidence and Management of T1a and T1b Prostate Cancer.', 'Association between prostate size and glandular tissue volume of the peripheral zone via novel combined MRI and histopathology: possible pathophysiological implications on prostate cancer development.', 'Urinary and sexual function changes in benign prostatic hyperplasia patients before and after transurethral columnar balloon dilatation of the prostate.', 'MRI determined prostate volume and the incidence of prostate cancer on MRI-fusion biopsy: a systemic review of reported data for the last 20\xa0years.', 'Incidence and associated factors for incidental prostate cancer among patients who underwent surgery for benign prostatic hyperplasia: first report from Somalia.']"""

However, the roles of proportion and architectural patterns of intraductal prostate carcinoma in patient outcomes remain unclear.  Materials and methods:   We retrospectively analyzed data on 644 patients with de novo metastatic prostate cancer between 2010 and 2017. Intraductal carcinoma of the prostate was identified from 12-core prostate biopsy. We calculated the proportion of intraductal prostate carcinoma and identified patterns according to the 2016 WHO classification. Propensity score matching was performed to balance baseline characteristics between patients with and without intraductal prostate carcinoma. Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox regression were used for survival analyses. The end points were castration resistant prostate cancer-free survival and overall survival.  Results:   Of the 644 patients 180 (28.0%) harbored intraductal carcinoma of the prostate. A 10% or greater incidence of the carcinoma was independently associated with worse prognosis (castration resistant prostate cancer-free survival HR 2.06, 95% CI 1.51-2.81, p <0.001, and overall survival HR 2.52, 95% CI 1.52-4.16, p <0.001), as was pattern 2 intraductal carcinoma of the prostate (HR 1.86, 95% CI 1.40-2.49, p <0.001, and HR 2.12, 95% CI 1.29-3.46, p = 0.003, respectively). Based on these 2 risk factors all men were classified into 5 groups. Patients in group 0 (no intraductal carcinoma of the prostate) and prostate intraductal carcinoma group 1 (less than 10% intraductal carcinoma, pattern 1) had favorable median castration resistant prostate cancer-free survival (18.0 vs 16.9 months, p = 0.871) and median overall survival (neither reached, p = 0.698). Men in intraductal carcinoma of the prostate group 4 (10% or greater intraductal carcinoma, pattern 2) harbored the worst outcomes (median castration resistant prostate cancer-free and overall survival 8.4 and 29.9 months, respectively). Group 2 (less than 10% intraductal carcinoma, pattern 2, with median castration resistant prostate cancer-free and overall survival 14.2 and 45.9 months) and group 3 (10% or less prostate intraductal carcinoma, pattern 1, with median castration resistant prostate cancer-free and overall survival 11.9 and 39.7 months, respectively) had an intermediate prognosis.  Conclusions:   A 10% or greater proportion of intraductal carcinoma of the prostate and pattern 2 were 2 unfavorable prognosticators of metastatic prostate cancer.

Even high-volume databases do not cover all patient characteristics and drawn results may be limited. A new viable automated solution is machine learning based on deep neural networks applied to natural language processing (NLP), extracting detailed information from narratively written (eg, pathologic radical prostatectomy [RP]) electronic health records (EHRs).  Methods:   Within an RP pathologic database, 3,679 RP EHRs were randomly split into 70% training and 30% test data sets. Training EHRs were automatically annotated, providing a semiautomatically annotated corpus of narratively written pathologic reports with initially context-free gold standard encodings. Primary and secondary Gleason pattern, corresponding percentages, tumor stage, nodal stage, total volume, tumor volume and diameter, and surgical margin were variables of interest. Second, state-of-the-art NLP techniques were used to train an industry-standard language model for pathologic EHRs by transfer learning. Finally, accuracy of the named entity extractors was compared with the gold standard encodings.  Results:   Agreement rates (95% confidence interval) for primary and secondary Gleason patterns each were 91.3% (89.4 to 93.0), corresponding to the following: Gleason percentages, 70.5% (67.6 to 73.3) and 80.9% (78.4 to 83.3); tumor stage, 99.3% (98.6 to 99.7); nodal stage, 98.7% (97.8 to 99.3); total volume, 98.3% (97.3 to 99.0); tumor volume, 93.3% (91.6 to 94.8); maximum diameter, 96.3% (94.9 to 97.3); and surgical margin, 98.7% (97.8 to 99.3). Cumulative agreement was 91.3%.  Conclusion:   Our proposed NLP pipeline offers new abilities for precise and efficient data management from narrative documentation for clinical research. The scalable approach potentially allows the NLP pipeline to be generalized to other genitourinary EHRs, tumor entities, and other medical disciplines.""","""['Sami-Ramzi Leyh-Bannurah', 'Zhe Tian', 'Pierre I Karakiewicz', 'Ulrich Wolffgang', 'Guido Sauter', 'Margit Fisch', 'Dirk Pehrke', 'Hartwig Huland', 'Markus Graefen', 'Lars Budäus']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""JCO Clin Cancer Inform""","""['A natural language processing program effectively extracts key pathologic findings from radical prostatectomy reports.', 'Automated Extraction of Diagnostic Criteria From Electronic Health Records for Autism Spectrum Disorders: Development, Evaluation, and Application.', 'Automated medical chart review for breast cancer outcomes research: a novel natural language processing extraction system.', 'Deep learning in clinical natural language processing: a methodical review.', 'Natural Language Processing in Electronic Health Records in relation to healthcare decision-making: A systematic review.', 'Natural language processing in urology: Automated extraction of clinical information from histopathology reports of uro-oncology procedures.', 'Expanding the Secondary Use of Prostate Cancer Real World Data: Automated Classifiers for Clinical and Pathological Stage.', 'A Novel Multiple Risk Score Model for Prediction of Long-Term Ischemic Risk in Patients With Coronary Artery Disease Undergoing Percutaneous Coronary Intervention: Insights From the I-LOVE-IT 2 Trial.', 'Artificial Intelligence Applications in Urology: Reporting Standards to Achieve Fluency for Urologists.', 'Automated Extraction of Tumor Staging and Diagnosis Information From Surgical Pathology Reports.']"""

Because these data are not collected for research purposes, it is imperative that the accuracy of codes used to identify patients, exposures, and outcomes is measured.  Patients and methods:   Code sensitivity was determined by identifying a cohort of men with histologically confirmed prostate cancer in the Ontario Cancer Registry and linking them to the Ontario Health Insurance Plan (OHIP) to determine whether a prostate biopsy code had been claimed. Code specificity was estimated using a random sample of patients at The Ottawa Hospital for whom a prostate biopsy code was submitted to OHIP. A simulation model, which varied the code false-positive rate, true-negative rate, and proportion of code positives in the population, was created to determine specificity under a range of combinations of these parameters.  Results:   Between 1991 and 2012, 97,369 of 148,669 men with histologically confirmed prostate cancer in the Ontario Cancer Registry had a prostate biopsy code in OHIP within 1 week of their diagnosis (code sensitivity, 86.0%). This increased significantly over time (63.8% in 1991 to 87.9% in 2012). The false-positive rate of the code for index prostate biopsies was 1.9%. The simulation model found that the code specificity exceeded 95% for first prostate biopsy but was lower for secondary biopsies because of more false positives. False positives primarily were related to placement of fiducial markers for patients who received radiotherapy.  Conclusion:   Administrative data in Ontario can accurately identify men who receive a prostate biopsy.

We developed a training set of patients ≥ 45 years of age with a first primary prostate cancer diagnosed within 4 years of the survey. After training, the sensitivity and specificity were obtained as functions of the cutoff values of the continuous output of the ANN.

The potential impact of such methods on clinical trial power and cost, however, is uncertain. We sought to test the hypothesis that GCE models can reduce estimated clinical trial cost in elderly patients with cancer.  Methods:   Patients with nonmetastatic head and neck (n = 9,677), breast (n = 22,929), or prostate cancer (n = 51,713) were sampled from the SEER-Medicare database. Using multivariable Cox proportional hazards models, we compared risk scores for all-cause mortality (ACM) and cancer-specific mortality (CSM) with GCE-based risk scores for each disease. We applied a cost function to estimate the cost and duration of clinical trials with a primary end point of overall survival in each population and in high-risk subpopulations. We conducted sensitivity analyses to examine model uncertainty.  Results:   For the purpose of enriching subpopulations, GCE models reduced estimated clinical trial cost compared with Cox models of ACM and CSM in all disease sites. The relative cost reductions with GCE models compared with ACM and CSM models, respectively, were -68.4% and -14.4% in prostate cancer, -38.8% and -18.3% in breast cancer, and -17.1% and -4.1% in head and neck cancer. Cost savings in breast and prostate cancers were on the order of millions of dollars. The GCE model also reduced relative clinical trial duration compared with CSM and ACM models for all disease sites. The optimal risk score cutoff for clinical trial enrollment occurred near the top tertile for all disease sites.

We present our single-institution experience with the development of a real-time observational registry fully integrated into the process of routine clinical workflow and show how this has the potential to transform research and quality assurance.  Materials and methods:   From May 2011 to May 2016, physicians prospectively inputted data during the process of routine charting on patients seen in clinic. Using a customized interface established between an in-house registry and a commercially available, hospital-based electronic medical record system (Epic Systems, Verona, WI), a departmentally based parser was created for automatic data deposition, which was also linked to the Aria Treatment Planning Station (Varian Medical Systems, Palo Alto, CA). The total number of data fields embedded per disease site ranged from nine to 73 (median, 21 fields).  Results:   A total of 12,341 patients were logged into the registry, of whom 6,911 completed a course of radiation therapy.

The robot-assisted TAP block cohort experienced lesser pain than the local anesthetic port infiltration cohort in the intervals of 6 to 12 hours (2.05 vs 3.21, p = 0.0016) and 12 to 18 hours (2.19 vs 2.97, p = 0.0495) postoperation.  Conclusion:   Robot-assisted TAP block is a safe alternative to local anesthetic port-site infiltration. Robot-assisted TAP is associated with lower postoperative pain scores and less narcotic use than local anesthetic port-site infiltration.""","""['Mohammed Shahait', 'Mona Yezdani', 'Benjamin Katz', 'Alexandra Lee', 'Sue-Jean Yu', 'David I Lee']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""J Endourol""","""['Impact of Combination of Local Anesthetic Wounds Infiltration and Ultrasound Transversus Abdominal Plane Block in Patients Undergoing Robot-Assisted Radical Prostatectomy: Perioperative Results of a Double-Blind Randomized Controlled Trial.', 'Use of transversus abdominis plane block to decrease pain scores and narcotic use following robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy.', 'Comparison of Therapeutic Benefit of Bupivacaine HCl Transversus Abdominis Plane (TAP) Block as Part of an Enhanced Recovery Pathway versus Traditional Oral and Intravenous Pain Control after Minimally Invasive Colorectal Surgery: A Prospective, Randomized, Double-Blind Trial.', 'Transversus abdominis-plane block versus local anesthetic wound infiltration in lower abdominal surgery: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.', 'Perioperative transversus abdominis plane (TAP) blocks for analgesia after abdominal surgery.', 'Surgeon administered transversus abdominis plane block: anatomic principles and technique.', 'Pediatric robotic surgery: issues in management-expert consensus from the Italian Society of Pediatric and Neonatal Anesthesia and Intensive Care (SARNePI) and the Italian Society of Pediatric Surgery (SICP).', 'An analysis of post-operative pain and narcotic use following robotic assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy for same day discharge.', 'Oncological and Functional Outcomes of Robot-Assisted Radical Prostatectomy in Kidney Transplant Recipients.', 'Same Day Discharge versus Inpatient Surgery for Robot-Assisted Radical Prostatectomy: A Comparative Study.']"""

These granules show exocrine-type morphology and positive expression for prostate specific antigen (PSA) and some lysosomal markers. The nature and the full immunohistochemical profile of the granules of EM have not been studied in detail yet.  Aim:   The aim of the current study is to investigate the expression of epithelial mucins (MUCs) in prostatic epithelium with EM.  Methods:   Twenty specimens from transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) were reviewed for the presence of EM and were stained with Periodic acid-Schiff's procedure with diastase digestion (PAS.D) and immunostained with PSA and MUCs: MUC1, MUC2, MUC5AC, and MUC6.  Results:   The EM-foci of all prostate glands are PAS.D, PSA positive and show constant immunoreactivity for MUC1. The expression of MUC1 is with membranous and cytoplasmic localization: predominantly apical with membranous accentuation in the cases of EM with large eosinophilic granules, and perinuclear in EM with small eosinophilic granules. There is no expression of other MUCs (MUC2, MUC5AC, and MUC6) in prostatic EM.  Conclusion:   We report for the first time that eosinophilic cytoplasmic granules in prostatic EM are MUC1 positive and can vary in size. Based on our immunohistochemical study we suggest that EM of the prostate is not a form of mucinous metaplasia. The present results enrich the available information about the immunophenotype of EM. We assume that MUC1 might serve as a reliable and constant, although nonspecific, immunohistochemical marker of benign EM-phenotype.""","""['Maria Koleva', 'Dorian Dikov', 'Veselin Belovejdov', 'Victoria Sarafian']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Eosinophilic metaplasia in transurethral resection of the prostate.', 'Paneth cell-like change of the prostate gland.

We evaluate the association between cholesterol-lowering medication with initiation of ADT and disease-specific death among PCa cases who underwent radical prostatectomy in Finland between 1995 and 2013.  Methods:   The study cohort included 14 424 men with PCa who underwent radical prostatectomy in Finland between 1995 and 2013. Cases were identified from national hospital discharge registry. Clinical data were amended from patient files of the treating hospitals. Information on co-morbidities, additional radiation- or chemotherapy, and causes of deaths were collected from national registries. Personal-level data on medication use during 1995-2014 were gathered from national prescription database. Registry linkages were carried out using personal identification number. Lipid-lowering drugs were categorized into statins and non-statin drugs. Risk of PCa death and initiation of ADT was analyzed using Cox-regression model with adjustment for age, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, co-morbidities and other drug use. Statin use was analyzed as time-dependent variable. Delayed risk associations were evaluated in lag-time analysis.  Results:   Compared to non-users the risk of PCa death was significantly lower among statin users before PCa diagnosis (HR 0.70, 95%CIs 0.52-0.95). For statin use after PCa diagnosis the risk was lowered in age-adjusted analysis (HR 0.76 95%CIs 0.62-0.93) but not after multivariable-adjustment. Post-diagnostic statin use was associated with improved PCa-specific survival in 1, 3 and 5 years lag-time analyses. The risk reduction was clearest for statin use initiated 5 years earlier (HR 0.71 95%CIs 0.55-0.92). Use of statins both before and after PCa diagnosis was associated with reduced risk of ADT use (HR 0.72 95%CIs 0.65-0.80 and HR 0.73, 95%CI 0.67-0.80, respectively). The risk of ADT decreased by increasing intensity of statin use before diagnosis.  Conclusion:   Statin use among surgically treated PCa patients has significant association with decreased risk of starting ADT and PCa death. The risk is lowered especially among men with statin use before PCa diagnosis and in men who used statins at high-dose.

Using intravital imaging and loss of function experiments, we determined invadopodia contain receptors involved in chemotaxis, namely GABA receptor and EGFR. These chemotaxis capabilities are mediated in part by PAK1 which controls invadopodia responsiveness to ligands such as GABA and EGF via assembly, stability, and turnover of invadopodia in vivo. PAK1 knockdown rendered cells unresponsive to chemotactic stimuli present in the stroma, resulting in dramatically lower rates of cancer cell extravasation and metastatic colony formation compared to stimulated cancer cells. In an experimental mouse model of brain metastasis, inhibition of PAK1 significantly reduced overall tumor burden and reduced the average size of brain metastases. In summary, invadopodia contain chemotaxis receptors that can respond to microenvironmental cues to guide cancer cell extravasation, and when PAK1 is depleted, brain tropism of metastatic breast cancer cells is significantly reduced, blocking secondary colony growth at sites otherwise permissive for metastatic outgrowth.""","""['Karla C Williams', 'Mario A Cepeda', 'Sumreen Javed', 'Karlee Searle', 'Katie M Parkins', 'Ashley V Makela', 'Amanda M Hamilton', 'Sepideh Soukhtehzari', 'Yohan Kim', 'Alan B Tuck', 'John A Ronald', 'Paula J Foster', 'Ann F Chambers', 'Hon S Leong']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Oncogene""","""['Endothelin-1 drives invadopodia and interaction with mesothelial cells through ILK.', 'p27Kip1 promotes invadopodia turnover and invasion through the regulation of the PAK1/Cortactin pathway.', 'EP4 receptor promotes invadopodia and invasion in human breast cancer.', 'Targeting invadopodia for blocking breast cancer metastasis.', 'Podosomes and invadopodia: tools to breach vascular basement membrane.', 'Endothelium and Subendothelial Matrix Mechanics Modulate Cancer Cell Transendothelial Migration.', 'Development of an in\xa0vivo system to model breast cancer metastatic organotropism and evaluate treatment response using the chick embryo.', 'In Vitro Tumor Models on Chip and Integrated Microphysiological Analysis Platform (MAP) for Life Sciences and High-Throughput Drug Screening.', 'Active Remodeling of Capillary Endothelium via Cancer Cell-Derived MMP9 Promotes Metastatic Brain Colonization.', 'Longitudinal bioluminescence imaging to monitor breast tumor growth and treatment response using the chick chorioallantoic membrane model.']"""

The activation of the pathway has been linked to PPARG gains/amplifications resulting in PPARγ overexpression and to recurrent activating point mutations of RXRα. Here, we report recurrent mutations of PPARγ that also activate the PPARγ/RXRα pathway, conferring PPARγ-dependency and supporting a crucial role of PPARγ in luminal bladder cancer. These mutations are found throughout the protein-including N-terminal, DNA-binding and ligand-binding domains-and most of them enhance protein activity. Structure-function studies of PPARγ variants with mutations in the ligand-binding domain allow identifying structural elements that underpin their gain-of-function.

It has been suggested that they may also provide a better radiation protection to radiotherapy patients as a consequence of the expected decrease in peripheral doses. This work aims to determine this reduction in unattended out-of-field regions, where no CT information is available but an important percentage of second primary cancers occur. For that purpose, ten different cases suitable for SBRT were chosen. Thus, 142 different treatment plans including SBRT, as well as 3D-CRT, IMRT and VMAT (with standard fractionation) in low and high energies for Varian (FF and FFF), Siemens and Elekta machines were created. Then, photon and neutron peripheral dose in 14 organs were assessed and compared using two analytical models. For the prostate case, uncomplicated and cancer free control probability estimation was also carried out. As a general behavior, SBRT plans led to the lowest peripheral doses followed by 3D-CRT, VMAT and IMRT, in this order. Unflattened beams proved to be the most effective in reducing peripheral doses, especially for 10 MV.

We previously reported that Octamer transcription factor 1 (OCT1), an AR collaborative factor, facilitated the AR genomic bindings to regulate diverse programs of gene expression in AR-dependent prostate cancer cells. Repression of OCT1 binding can serve as a potential treatment strategy for advanced prostate cancer. However, the precise mechanism underlying the functions of OCT1 in advanced prostate cancer, especially lethal castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), is still unclear. To uncover specific OCT1 functions in disease progression, we explored global OCT1-binding regions by performing chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing in CRPC model 22Rv1 cells. We found that the OCT1 expression level and the obtained OCT1-binding regions increased in 22Rv1 cells compared with AR-dependent prostate cancer LNCaP cells. Interestingly, microarray analysis revealed that OCT1 regulates CRPC-specific target genes in addition to representative AR-regulated genes such as ACSL3. Pathway analysis showed the importance of OCT1 in regulating cell cycle‒related genes. By performing the chromatin immunoprecipitation assay, we validated anillin actin-binding protein (ANLN), which is highly expressed in CRPC and robustly regulated with OCT1 recruitment to the intron and promoter regions in 22Rv1 cells in comparison with LNCaP cells. Furthermore, knockdown of ANLN exhibited impaired cell growth and cell cycle progression, suggesting an important function of ANLN in CRPC cells. In conclusion, these findings raise the possibility that OCT1 coordinates AR signaling in a specific manner that is dependent on disease stage and promotes progression to CRPC.""","""['Ken-Ichi Takayama', 'Yutaka Suzuki', 'Shinichiro Yamamoto', 'Daisuke Obinata', 'Satoru Takahashi', 'Satoshi Inoue']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Endocrinology""","""['Letter to the Editor: ""Integrative Genomic Analysis of OCT1 Reveals Coordinated Regulation of Androgen Receptor in Advanced Prostate Cancer"".', 'Targeting Oct1 genomic function inhibits androgen receptor signaling and castration-resistant prostate cancer growth.', 'Identification of new octamer transcription factor 1-target genes upregulated in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Nucleoporin 62 and Ca(2+)/calmodulin dependent kinase kinase 2 regulate androgen receptor activity in castrate resistant prostate cancer cells.', 'Androgen receptor-dependent and -independent mechanisms driving prostate cancer progression: Opportunities for therapeutic targeting from multiple angles.', 'Implications of ubiquitin ligases in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Transcription factor CASZ1 increases an oncogenic transcriptional process in tumorigenesis and progression of glioma cells.', 'Targeting phase separation on enhancers induced by transcription factor complex formations as a new strategy for treating drug-resistant cancers.', 'OCT1-target neural gene PFN2 promotes tumor growth in androgen receptor-negative prostate cancer.', 'OCT1 Is a Poor Prognostic Factor for Breast Cancer Patients and Promotes Cell Proliferation via Inducing NCAPH.', 'A Large-Scale Association Study Detects Novel Rare Variants, Risk Genes, Functional Elements, and Polygenic Architecture of Prostate Cancer Susceptibility.']"""

Materials and methods:   178 expressed prostatic secretion positive patients with serum prostate specific antigen levels of ≥ 2.5 ng / mL were included in present prospective study. The diagnostic evaluation included detailed history and physical examination, digital rectal examination, urine analysis, urine culture, and expressed prostatic secretions tests. Transrectal ultrasonography was used both to measure prostate volume and conduct 12 core prostate biopsy.  Results:   The prevalence of NIH category IV prostatitis was 36.9% (178 / 482) in our population of men. In our study patients (n: 178) prostate biopsy results were classified as; 66 prostatitis, 81 BPH, and 31 Pca. In asymptomatic prostatitis group, expressed prostatic secretion mean leucocyte ratio was higher compared to other two groups (p < 0.0001). The relation between number of expressed prostatic secretion leucocytes and prostatitis, benign prostate hyperplasia, and prostate cancer is analyzed. If 16 is taken as the cut of number for leucocyte presence, its sensitivity is 0.92 (AUC = 0.78 p = 0.01).  Conclusions:   The number of leucocytes in expressed prostatic secretion is higher in the chronic prostatitis group. If the leukocyte presence of 16 and above is taken as the cut off point, the sensitivity becomes 0.92 (AUC = 0.78).

A major change in prostate includes pathologically organ - confined disease to be considered pT2 and no longer subclassified by extent of involvement or laterality. The aim of this study was to validate this major change.  Materials and methods:   Prostates were step - sectioned from 196 patients submitted to radical prostatectomy with organ confined disease (pT2) and negative surgical margins. Tumor extent was evaluated by a semiquantitative point count method. The dominant nodule extent was recorded as the maximal number of positive points of the largest single focus of cancer from the quadrants. Laterality was considered as either total tumor extent (Group 1) or index tumor extent (Group 2). Time to biochemical recurrence was analyzed with the Kaplan - Meier product limit analysis and prediction of shorter time to biochemical recurrence with Cox proportional hazards model.  Results:   In Group 1, 43 / 196 (21.9%) tumors were unilateral and 153 / 196 (78.1%) bilateral and in Group 2, 156 / 196 (79.6%) tumors were unilateral and 40 / 196 (20.4%) bilateral. In both groups, comparing unilateral vs bilateral tumors, there was no significant clinicopathological difference, and no significant association with time as well as prediction of shorter time to biochemical recurrence following surgery.

Moreover, ZA exerts an anti-tumor effect in several tumors. Despite this evidence, the relevance of ZA in prostate cancer (PCa) is not completely understood.  Objective:   To investigate the effect of ZA administration on the invasive properties of PC3 cells, which are characterised by RhoA-dependent amoeboid motility.  Methods:   The effect of ZA administration on the in vitro invasive properties of PC3 cells was evaluated by cell migration in 3D collagen matrices, immunofluorescence and Boyden assays or transendothelial migration. Lung retention and colonization assays were performed to assess the efficacy of ZA administration in vivo.  Results:   PC3 cells are characterised by RhoA-dependent amoeboid motility. We now report a clear inhibition of in vitro PC3 cell invasion and RhoA activity upon ZA treatment. Moreover, to confirm a specific role of ZA in the inhibition of amoeboid motility of PC3 cells, we demonstrate that ZA interferes only partially with PC3 cells showing a mesenchymal phenotype due to both treatment with conditioned medium of cancer associated fibroblasts or to the acquisition of chemoresistance. Furthermore, we demonstrate that ZA impairs adhesion to endothelial cells and the trans-endothelial cell migration, two essential properties characterising amoeboid motility and PC3 metastatic dissemination. In vivo experiments prove the ability of ZA to inhibit the metastatic process of PC3 cells as shown by the decrease in lung colonization.  Conclusion:   This study demonstrates that ZA inhibits Rho-dependent amoeboid motility of PC3 cells, thus suggesting ZA as a potential therapy to impede the metastatic dissemination of PC3 cells.""","""['Laura Pietrovito', 'Giuseppina Comito', 'Matteo Parri', 'Elisa Giannoni', 'Paola Chiarugi', 'Maria Letizia Taddei']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Curr Cancer Drug Targets""","""['Zoledronic acid impairs stromal reactivity by inhibiting M2-macrophages polarization and prostate cancer-associated fibroblasts.', 'Zoledronic Acid Enhanced the Antitumor Effect of Cisplatin on Orthotopic Osteosarcoma by ROS-PI3K/AKT Signaling and Attenuated Osteolysis.', 'Efficacy of zoledronic acid for the elimination of disseminated tumor cells in a clinically relevant, spontaneously metastatic prostate cancer xenograft model.', 'Various pathways of zoledronic acid against osteoclasts and bone cancer metastasis: a brief review.', 'Initial steps of metastasis: cell invasion and endothelial transmigration.', 'Claisened Hexafluoro Inhibits Metastatic Spreading of Amoeboid Melanoma Cells.', 'Cytokinesis regulators as potential diagnostic and therapeutic biomarkers for human hepatocellular carcinoma.', 'Potential Molecular Mechanism of TNF Superfamily-Related Genes in Glioblastoma Multiforme Based on Transcriptome and Epigenome.', 'Targeting SREBP-2-Regulated Mevalonate Metabolism for Cancer Therapy.']"""

Patients and methods:   Overall, 99 patients with DM and 213 patients without DM who underwent RARP with at least 2-year follow-up were included. The preoperative prostate biopsy Gleason scores and clinical stages of the groups were similar. The patients who were dry or used one safety pad per day were regarded as continent. Early (0-3 months), mid-term (4-12 months), and late-term (>12 months) continence rates were evaluated.  Results:   In diabetic and nondiabetic groups, mean age was 63.3 ± 6.5 and 61.3 ± 6.8 years, respectively (p = 0.015). On the day of the removal of the urethral catheter, 61.6% (n = 61) of the diabetic patients and 99.1% (n = 211) of the nondiabetic patients were continent (p = 0.000).

Prostate cancer cells exhibit increased de novo synthesis of fatty acids (FA); however, little is known about how extracellular FAs, such as those in the circulation, may support prostate cancer progression. Here, we show that increasing FA availability increased intracellular triacylglycerol content in cultured patient-derived tumor explants, LNCaP and C4-2B spheroids, a range of prostate cancer cells (LNCaP, C4-2B, 22Rv1, PC-3), and prostate epithelial cells (PNT1). Extracellular FAs are the major source (∼83%) of carbons to the total lipid pool in all cell lines, compared with glucose (∼13%) and glutamine (∼4%), and FA oxidation rates are greater in prostate cancer cells compared with PNT1 cells, which preferentially partitioned extracellular FAs into triacylglycerols. Because of the higher rates of FA oxidation in C4-2B cells, cells remained viable when challenged by the addition of palmitate to culture media and inhibition of mitochondrial FA oxidation sensitized C4-2B cells to palmitate-induced apoptosis. Whereas in PC-3 cells, palmitate induced apoptosis, which was prevented by pretreatment of PC-3 cells with FAs, and this protective effect required DGAT-1-mediated triacylglycerol synthesis. These outcomes highlight for the first-time heterogeneity of lipid metabolism in prostate cancer cells and the potential influence that obesity-associated dyslipidemia or host circulating has on prostate cancer progression.

Olive oil production is associated with the generation of a waste material, termed 'olive mill wastewater' (OMWW) that have been reported to contain water-soluble polyphenols. Prostate cancer (PCa) is considered as an ideal cancer type for chemopreventive approaches, due to its wide incidence but relatively long latency period and progression time.

We tested the feasibility of replacing onsite study visits with telemedicine visits in a prospective clinical trial.  Methods:   Castration-naïve patients with prostate cancer and a rising serum prostate-specific antigen after definitive local therapy were eligible. Patients were required to have a single onsite visit for enrollment. Study treatment consisted of oral metformin 850 mg daily for 1 month followed by 850 mg twice daily for 5 months. Telehealth video visits (televisits) were conducted monthly by using a Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act-compliant smartphone application. The primary objective was to determine the feasibility of telemedicine-enabled study visits. Secondary objectives were defining safety, anticancer activity, quality of life, and patient satisfaction.  Results:   Fifteen patients with a median age of 68 years (range, 57 to 83 years) and median one-way driving time to the study center of 71 minutes (range, 12 to 147 minutes) were enrolled. The patients completed 84 eligible televisits (completion rate, 100%; 95% CI, 0.80 to 1).

Patients and methods:   The comparator arms of four phase III clinical trials in first-line mCRPC were collected, annotated, and compiled, with a total of 2,070 patients. Early discontinuation was defined as treatment stoppage within 3 months as a result of adverse treatment effects; 10% of patients discontinued treatment. We designed an open-data, crowd-sourced DREAM Challenge for developing models with which to predict early discontinuation of docetaxel treatment. Clinical features for all four trials and outcomes for three of the four trials were made publicly available, with the outcomes of the fourth trial held back for unbiased model evaluation. Challenge participants from around the world trained models and submitted their predictions. Area under the precision-recall curve was the primary metric used for performance assessment.  Results:   In total, 34 separate teams submitted predictions. Seven models with statistically similar area under precision-recall curves (Bayes factor ≤ 3) outperformed all other models. A postchallenge analysis of risk prediction using these seven models revealed three patient subgroups: high risk, low risk, or discordant risk. Early discontinuation events were two times higher in the high-risk subgroup compared with the low-risk subgroup. Simulation studies demonstrated that use of patient discontinuation prediction models could reduce patient enrollment in clinical trials without the loss of statistical power.  Conclusion:   This work represents a successful collaboration between 34 international teams that leveraged open clinical trial data. Our results demonstrate that routinely collected clinical features can be used to identify patients with mCRPC who are likely to discontinue treatment because of adverse events and establishes a robust benchmark with implications for clinical trial design.""","""['Fatemeh Seyednasrollah', 'Devin C Koestler', 'Tao Wang', 'Stephen R Piccolo', 'Roberto Vega', 'Russell Greiner', 'Christiane Fuchs', 'Eyal Gofer', 'Luke Kumar', 'Russell D Wolfinger', 'Kimberly Kanigel Winner', 'Chris Bare', 'Elias Chaibub Neto', 'Thomas Yu', 'Liji Shen', 'Kald Abdallah', 'Thea Norman', 'Gustavo Stolovitzky', 'Howard R Soule', 'Christopher J Sweeney', 'Charles J Ryan', 'Howard I Scher', 'Oliver Sartor', 'Laura L Elo', 'Fang Liz Zhou', 'Justin Guinney', 'James C Costello;Prostate Cancer DREAM Challenge Community']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""JCO Clin Cancer Inform""","""['Prediction of overall survival for patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer: development of a prognostic model through a crowdsourced challenge with open clinical trial data.', 'Custirsen (OGX-011) combined with cabazitaxel and prednisone versus cabazitaxel and prednisone alone in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer previously treated with docetaxel (AFFINITY): a randomised, open-label, international, phase 3 trial.', 'Subsequent Chemotherapy and Treatment Patterns After Abiraterone Acetate in Patients with Metastatic Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer: Post Hoc Analysis of COU-AA-302.', 'Targeting Metastatic Hormone Sensitive Prostate Cancer: Chemohormonal Therapy and New Combinatorial Approaches.', 'Treatment situation in metastastic Castration Naive Prostate Cancer (mCRPC) and the implications on clinical routine.', 'Case Studies for Overcoming Challenges in Using Big Data in Cancer.', 'A Crowdsourcing Approach to Develop Machine Learning Models to Quantify Radiographic Joint Damage in Rheumatoid Arthritis.', 'BepiTBR: T-B reciprocity enhances B cell epitope prediction.', 'Statistical Hypothesis Testing versus Machine Learning Binary Classification: Distinctions and Guidelines.', 'Treatment Stratification of Patients with Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer by Machine Learning.']"""

However, emerging evidence suggests that early SRT (ie, SRT delivered at PSA values < 0.2 ng/mL, but generally ≥ 0.05 ng/mL) improves oncologic outcomes. We evaluated the feasibility of improving referral rates for discussion of early SRT by using a dynamic registry that identifies through the electronic medical record patients with rising postprostatectomy PSA levels.  Methods:   We developed an iteratively updated registry that identifies patients who fall within two postoperative PSA strata: ≥ 0.05 to < 0.1 ng/mL and ≥ 0.1 to < 0.2 ng/mL. We compared referral rates to radiation oncology during a 3-year period before use of this registry with those during a 1-year period after promotion of the registry in multidisciplinary tumor board settings.  Results:   Before promotion of the registry, referral rates for patients with PSA values ≥ 0.05 to < 0.1 ng/mL and ≥ 0.1 to < 0.2 ng/mL were 35% and 65%, respectively. After promotion of the registry, referral rates within each stratum increased significantly to 82% and 94%, respectively ( P < .05 for both by Fisher's exact test). The overall rate of referral for patients with PSA values ≥ 0.05 to < 0.2 ng/mL rose from 48% to 90% ( P < .001).  Conclusion:   The creation of a registry of patients with rising postprostatectomy PSA values can facilitate increased referral rates for early SRT without burdening providers with a clinical support tool embedded within the EMR itself. This is true even in the case of already high baseline rates of referral for early SRT. The changes reported herein most likely reflect a Hawthorne effect wherein the ability to track referrals rather than a direct function of the registry influenced practice patterns. Nonetheless, the registry provided an integral framework to allow for tracking.""","""['Amar U Kishan', 'Eric M Cheng', 'Eric Schmidt', 'Christopher Saigal', 'Robert E Reiter', 'Patrick A Kupelian', 'Michael L Steinberg', 'Christopher R King']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""JCO Clin Cancer Inform""","""['Prostate-specific antigen after salvage radiotherapy for postprostatectomy biochemical recurrence predicts long-term outcome including overall survival.', 'Defining biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy and timing of early salvage radiotherapy : Informing the debate.', 'Prostate specific antigen doubling time subsequent to radical prostatectomy as a prognosticator of outcome following salvage radiotherapy.', 'The timing of salvage radiotherapy after radical prostatectomy: a systematic review.', 'pT3R1 prostate cancer : Immediate or delayed radiotherapy after radical prostatectomy?.']"""

Results:   Tabular formatting was significantly more accurate (97% v 93%; P = .001) and faster (mean normalized time, 0.74 + 0.40 v 0.99 + 0.52; P < .001) than synoptic formatting.

Here, we present the raw and adjusted co-occurrence rates of cancer and CVD in the overall population by using a visually intuitive network approach.  Methods:   By using baseline survey and linked health outcome data from 490,842 individuals age 40 to 69 years from the UK Biobank, we recorded diagnoses between 1997 and 2014 of specific cancers and specific CVDs ascertained through hospital claims. We measured raw and adjusted rates of CVD for the following groups: individuals with Hodgkin or non-Hodgkin lymphoma, lung and trachea cancer, uterus cancer, colorectal cancer, prostate cancer, breast cancer, or no recorded diagnosed cancer during this time period. Analysis accounted for age, sex, and behavioral risk factors, without regard to the order of occurrence of cancer and CVD.  Results:   A significantly increased rate of CVD was found in patients with multiple types of cancers, including Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin lymphoma and lung and trachea, uterus, colorectal, and breast cancer, compared with patients without cancer by using age and sex-adjusted models. Increased co-occurrence for many CVD categories remained after correction for behavioral risk factors. Construction of co-occurrence networks highlighted heart failure as a shared CVD diagnosis across multiple cancer types, including breast cancer, lung cancer, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and colorectal cancer. Smoking, physical activity, and other lifestyle factors accounted for some but not all of the increased co-occurrence for many of the CVD diagnoses.  Conclusion:   Increased co-occurrence of several common CVD conditions is seen widely across multiple malignancies, and shared diagnoses, such as heart failure, were highlighted by using network methods.""","""['Christine W Duarte', 'Volkhard Lindner', 'Sanjeev A Francis', 'Dounya Schoormans']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""JCO Clin Cancer Inform""","""['Having co-morbid cardiovascular disease at time of cancer diagnosis: already one step behind when it comes to HRQoL?', 'Leisure time physical activity and long-term cardiovascular and cancer outcomes: the Busselton Health Study.', 'Prevalence of Cardiovascular Risk Factors Among Cancer Patients in the United States.', 'The epidemiology of cardiovascular disease in the UK 2014.', 'Shared Risk Factors in Cardiovascular Disease and Cancer.', 'Atherosclerosis, Diabetes Mellitus, and Cancer: Common Epidemiology, Shared Mechanisms, and Future Management.', 'Atrial Cardiomyopathy Predicts Worse Outcome in Patients With Lung Cancer.', 'The effect of disease co-occurrence measurement on multimorbidity networks: a population-based study.', 'Cancer Incidence and Mortality According to Pre-Existing Heart\xa0Failure in a Community-Based Cohort.', 'Association of colorectal cancer with genetic and epigenetic variation in PEAR1-A population-based cohort study.']"""

At the gene level, we observed significant associations between all prostate cancer and NPAS2 and PER1 after correcting for multiple testing, while only RORA was significant for aggressive tumors.

This phenomenon also has a significant impact on the etiology of prostate cancer (PCa). Using several in vitro models, the roles of vitamin D3 on energy metabolism and its implication in primary, early, and late invasive PCa were investigated. BODIPY staining and qPCR analyses show that 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25(OH)2D3) up-regulates de novo lipogenesis in PCa cells by orchestrating transcriptional regulation that affects cholesterol and lipid metabolic pathways. This lipogenic effect is highly dependent on the interaction of several nuclear receptors and their corresponding ligands, including androgen receptor (AR), vitamin D receptor (VDR), and retinoid X receptor (RXR). In contrast, inhibition of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARα) signaling blocks the induction of the lipogenic phenotype induced by these receptors. Furthermore, 1,25(OH)2D3, T, and 9 cis-retinoic acid (9-cis RA) together redirect cytosolic citrate metabolism toward fatty acid synthesis by restoring normal prostatic zinc homeostasis that functions to truncate TCA cycle metabolism. 1,25(OH)2D3, T, and 9-cis RA also exert additional control of TCA cycle metabolism by down-regulating SLC25A19, which limits the availability of the co-factor thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP) that is required for enzymatic catalyzation of citrate oxidation. This extensive metabolic reprogramming mediated by 1,25(OH)2D3, T, and 9-cis RA is preserved in all in vitro cell lines investigated. These data suggest that 1,25(OH)2D3 and T are important regulators of normal prostatic energy metabolism. Based on the close association between energy metabolism and cancer progression, supplementation of vitamin D3 and testosterone can restrict the energy production that is required to drive PCa progression by maintaining proper zinc homeostasis and inhibiting TCA cycle activity in PCa cells.""","""['Polly Zhang', 'Adam Schatz', 'Babatunde Adeyemi', 'David Kozminski', 'JoEllen Welsh', 'Martin Tenniswood', 'Wei-Lin Winnie Wang']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""J Steroid Biochem Mol Biol""","""['The vitamin D hormone and its nuclear receptor: molecular actions and disease states.', '1,25(OH)2D3 disrupts glucose metabolism in prostate cancer cells leading to a truncation of the TCA cycle and inhibition of TXNIP expression.', 'Induction of androgen receptor by 1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 and 9-cis retinoic acid in LNCaP human prostate cancer cells.', 'Retinoid X receptors stimulate and 9-cis retinoic acid inhibits 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3-activated expression of the rat osteocalcin gene.', 'Vitamin D and systemic cancer: is this relevant to malignant melanoma?', 'Vitamin D and Bone: A Story of Endocrine and Auto/Paracrine Action in Osteoblasts.', 'Zinc in Prostate Health and Disease: A Mini Review.', 'UCHL5 Promotes Proliferation and Migration of Bladder Cancer Cells by Activating c-Myc via AKT/mTOR Signaling.', 'Vitamin D regulation of energy metabolism in cancer.', 'Photoprotective Properties of Vitamin D and Lumisterol Hydroxyderivatives.']"""

This study examined the association of urinary PCA3 and TMPRSS2:ERG (T2:ERG) with biopsy-based reclassification.  Methods:   Urine was collected at baseline, 6, 12, and 24 months in the multi-institutional Canary Prostate Active Surveillance Study (PASS), and PCA3 and T2:ERG levels were quantitated. Reclassification was an increase in Gleason score or ratio of biopsy cores with cancer to ≥34%. The association of biomarker scores, adjusted for common clinical variables, with short- and long-term reclassification was evaluated. Discriminatory capacity of models with clinical variables alone or with biomarkers was assessed using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and decision curve analysis (DCA).  Results:   Seven hundred and eighty-two men contributed 2069 urine specimens. After adjusting for PSA, prostate size, and ratio of biopsy cores with cancer, PCA3 but not T2:ERG was associated with short-term reclassification at the first surveillance biopsy (OR = 1.3; 95% CI 1.0-1.7, p = 0.02). The addition of PCA3 to a model with clinical variables improved area under the curve from 0.743 to 0.753 and increased net benefit minimally. After adjusting for clinical variables, neither marker nor marker kinetics was associated with time to reclassification in subsequent biopsies.

Materials and methods:   Data, urine, and fecal samples prospectively collected from 30 patients before and after transrectal biopsy of the prostate. DNA was extracted from urine collected after a prostate massage before and after prostate biopsy, and from fecal samples collected before the biopsy. We sequenced DNA using the bacterial 16S rRNA high-throughput next-generation sequencing and analyzed changes in microbial profiles for taxonomy comparison between samples.  Results:   Pre-biopsy urinary microbial profiles contained Lactobacillus and Staphylococcus bacteria. Post-biopsy urinary microbial profiles included lower levels of Lactobacillus and higher levels of Prevotella bacteria. Bacteroides bacteria were predominant in fecal samples. We identified two clustering patterns containing both pre- and post-biopsy urine samples. Cluster 1 had a urine cluster pattern that was distinct from fecal, whereas cluster 2 was similar to fecal. We observed two different modes of microbial changes, 11 patients had both of their urine (pre and post) samples associated with a particular cluster group, whereas others (n = 15) had movement between clusters 1 and 2 following the biopsy procedure. Four patient's post-biopsy urine microbial profiles clustered very tightly to the fecal microbial profile.

These variants, such as AR-V7, originate from aberrant splicing of the AR pre-mRNA and the inclusion of a cryptic exon containing a premature stop codon in the mRNA. The resulting loss of the ligand-binding domain allows AR-V7 to act as a constitutively active transcription factor. Here, we designed two antisense oligonucleotides (AONs) directed against cryptic splicing signals within the AR pre-mRNA. These two AONs, AON-ISE and AON-ESE, demonstrated high efficiency in silencing AR-V7 splicing without affecting full-length AR expression. The subsequent downregulation of AR-V7-target gene UBE2C was accompanied by inhibition of androgen-independent cell proliferation and induction of apoptosis in castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC)-derived cell line models 22Rv1, DuCaP, and VCaP.

In particular, metabolites are emerging as active players in driving immunosuppression. Here we demonstrate that in a prostate cancer model lactate released by glycolytic cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) acts on CD4+ T cells, shaping T-cell polarization. In particular, CAFs exposure (i) reduces the percentage of the antitumoral Th1 subset, inducing a lactate-dependent, SIRT1-mediated deacetylation/degradation of T-bet transcription factor; (ii) increases Treg cells, driving naive T cells polarization, through a lactate-based NF-kB activation and FoxP3 expression.

Younger men are often counseled to undergo definitive treatment despite limited data on the outcomes of active surveillance in younger men. We compared clinical characteristics and outcomes in men who enrolled in active surveillance at age less than 60 vs 60 years old or older.  Materials and methods:   We retrospectively reviewed the records of 2 institutional cohorts of a total of 2,084 men in whom prostate cancer was managed by active surveillance between 1995 and 2016. We compared outcomes in men who began active surveillance at age 60 vs 60 years or older using the Kaplan-Meier method and Cox proportional hazards regression.  Results:   We identified 417 and 1,667 men who began active surveillance at younger than 60 and 60 years old or older, respectively, who met study inclusion criteria. At a median followup of 6.2 years we found no significant difference between men younger than 60 and 60 years old or older in the 5-year rates of biopsy progression-free survival (83% vs 83%), treatment-free survival (74% vs 71%), metastasis-free survival (99.7% vs 99.0%) or prostate cancer specific survival (100% vs 99.7%). Of the younger men 131 (31%) ultimately underwent treatment, including for pathological progression in 67% and prostate specific antigen progression in 18%. On multivariate analysis significant predictors of biopsy progression and progression to treatment among younger men were 20% or greater involvement of any core on diagnostic biopsy (HR 2.21, p = 0.003) and prostate specific antigen density 0.15 ng/ml/ml or greater (HR 1.93, p = 0.01).

We studied this effect in locally advanced prostate cancer, a high-risk feature associated with approximately 20% of prostate cancer specific mortality.  Methods:   We used immunohistochemistry for CD34, fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2), FSHR, podoplanin, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and VEGFR-2 as well as histochemical methods to examine the vasa nervorum of nerves invaded by cancer cells in tissue samples from 85 patients.  Results:   The percentage of the nerve area occupied by CD34-positive vasa nervorum endothelial cells in nerves with PNI was much higher than in nerves without PNI (7.3 ± 1.2 vs 1.9 ± 0.4; P < 0.001 and 5.8 ± 0.6 vs 1.23 ± 0.8; P < 0.001 in pT3a and pT3b prostate cancer specimens, respectively).

This subendothelial layer contains collagen fibers. Vasa nervorum endothelia and Schwann cells express FGF-2 (nuclear localization) and FSHR (plasma membrane and cytoplasmic staining). Prostate cancer cells invading nerves express VEGF, a critical cytokine in tumor angiogenesis. The vasa nervorum of prostatic nerves with PNI did not express detectable levels of VEGFR-2.

Major experimental techniques included biotin-streptavidin pulldown assay coupled with mass-spectrometry, in vitro enzyme activity assay for Krebs cycle enzymes and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) for metabolomic analysis.  Results:   Among 14 verified protein targets, four were Krebs cycle enzymes, fumarate hydratase (FH), malate dehydrogenase-2 (MDH2), dihydrolipoamide acetyltransferase (DLAT) in pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDHC) and dihydrolipoamide S-succinyltransferase (DLST) in a-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex (KGDHC). Functional assays revealed that PDHC and KGDHC activities at the basal level were significantly higher in prostate cancer cells compared to benign prostate BPH1 cells, while alternol treatment reduced their activities in cancer cells close to the levels in BPH1 cells. Although FH and MDH2 activities were comparable among prostate cancer and benign cell lines at the basal level, Alternol treatment largely increased their activities in cancer cells. Metabolomic analysis revealed that Alternol treatment remarkably reduced the levels of malic acid, fumaric acid, and isocitric acid and mitochondrial respiration in prostate cancer cells. Alternol also drastically reduced mitochondrial respiration and ATP production in PC-3 cells in vitro or in xenograft tissues but not in BPH1 cells or host liver tissues.

PSMA antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) is a fully human IgG1 monoclonal antibody conjugated to the microtubule disrupting agent monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE), which is designed to specifically bind PSMA-positive cells, internalize, and then release its cytotoxic payload into the cells. PSMA ADC has demonstrated potent and selective antitumor activity in preclinical models of advanced prostate cancer. A Phase 1 study was conducted to assess the safety, pharmacokinetics, and preliminary antitumor effects of PSMA ADC in subjects with treatment-refractory prostate cancer.  Methods:   In this first-in-man dose-escalation study, PSMA ADC was administered by intravenous infusion every three weeks to subjects with progressive metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) who were previously treated with docetaxel chemotherapy. The primary endpoint was to establish a maximum tolerated dose (MTD). The study also examined the pharmacokinetics of the study drug, total antibody, and free MMAE. Antitumor effects were assessed by measuring changes in serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA), circulating tumor cells (CTCs), and radiologic imaging.  Results:   Fifty-two subjects were administered doses ranging from 0.4 to 2.8 mg/kg. Subjects had a median of two prior chemotherapy regimens and prior treatment with abiraterone and/or enzalutamide. Neutropenia and peripheral neuropathy were identified as important first-cycle and late dose-limiting toxicities, respectively. The dose of 2.5 mg/kg was determined to be the MTD. Pharmacokinetics were approximately dose-proportional with minimal drug accumulation. Reductions in PSA and CTCs in subjects treated with doses of ≥1.8 mg/kg were durable and often concurrent.  Conclusions:   In an extensively pretreated mCRPC population, PSMA ADC demonstrated acceptable toxicity. Antitumor activity was observed over dose ranges up to and including 2.5 mg/kg. The observed anti-tumor activity supported further evaluation of this novel agent for the treatment of advanced metastatic prostate cancer.""","""['Daniel P Petrylak', 'Philip Kantoff', 'Nicholas J Vogelzang', 'Anthony Mega', 'Mark T Fleming', 'Joe J Stephenson Jr', 'Richard Frank', 'Neal D Shore', 'Robert Dreicer', 'Edward F McClay', 'William R Berry', 'Manish Agarwal', 'Vincent A DiPippo', 'Yakov Rotshteyn', 'Nancy Stambler', 'William C Olson', 'Stephen A Morris', 'Robert J Israel']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['PSMA ADC monotherapy in patients with progressive metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer following abiraterone and/or enzalutamide: Efficacy and safety in open-label single-arm phase 2 study.', 'In vitro and in vivo responses of advanced prostate tumors to PSMA ADC, an auristatin-conjugated antibody to prostate-specific membrane antigen.', 'Potent antitumor activity of an auristatin-conjugated, fully human monoclonal antibody to prostate-specific membrane antigen.', 'Radioimmunotherapy of Metastatic Prostate Cancer with ¹⁷⁷Lu-DOTAhuJ591 Anti Prostate Specific Membrane Antigen Specific Monoclonal Antibody.', 'Antibody-drug conjugates targeting prostate-specific membrane antigen.', 'Cancer-cell-intrinsic mechanisms shaping the immunosuppressive landscape of prostate cancer.', 'Antibody-drug conjugates: beyond current approvals and potential future strategies.', 'Modular Smart Molecules for PSMA-Targeted Chemotherapy.', 'Chemotherapy and Physical Therapeutics Modulate Antigens on Cancer Cells.', 'Telomerase positive CTCs with PSMA high expression associated with prostate cancer metastasis.']"""

Here, we report an effective transportation system utilizing both of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and their secreted microvesicles containing assembled gold nanostars (GNS) for targeted photothermal therapy of prostate cancer. The stem cells act as a cell carrier to actively load and assemble GNS into the lysosomes. Accumulation of GNS in the lysosomes facilitates the close interaction of nanoparticles, which could result in a 20 nm red-shift of surface plasmon resonance of GNS with a broad absorption in the near infrared region. Moreover, the MSCs can behave like an engineering factory to pack and release the GNS clusters into microvesicles. The secretion of GNS can be stimulated via light irradiation, providing an external trigger-assisted approach to encapsulate nanoparticles into cell derived microvesicles. In vivo studies demonstrate that GNS-loaded MSCs have an extensive intratumoral distribution, as monitored via photoacoustic imaging, and efficient antitumor effect under light exposure in a prostate-cancer subcutaneous model by intratumoral and intravenous injection.

Forced expression of miR-338-3p suppressed prostate cancer cell proliferation, migration, and invasion in vitro and tumor growth in vivo, while apoptosis was induced. Further experiments revealed that RAB23 is a target of miR-338-3p because miR-338-3p bound directly to the 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) of RAB23 mRNA, thereby reducing both the mRNA and protein levels of RAB23. Reintroduction of RAB23 attenuated the inhibitory effects of miR-338-3p on proliferation, migration, and invasiveness of prostate cancer cells. In clinical samples, miR-338-3p levels negatively correlated with RAB23 expression, which was upregulated in prostate cancer.

However, the role of Robo 4 in prostate cancer (PCa), the second common cause of cancer death among men in -developed countries, has not been described yet. Thus, the present study investigates for the first time the impact of Robo 4 in PCa both in the clinical setting and in vitro. Methods and Results: Immunohistochemical analyses of benign and malignant prostate tissue samples of 95 PCa patients, who underwent radical prostatectomy (RPE), revealed a significant elevated expression of Robo 4 as well as its ligand Slit 2 protein in cancerous tissue compared to benign. Moreover, increased Robo 4 expression was associated with higher Gleason score and pT stage. In advanced stage we observed a hypothesis-generating trend that high Robo 4 and Slit 2 expression is associated with delayed development of tumor recurrence compared to patients with low Robo 4 and Slit 2 expression, respectively. In contrast to so far described exclusive expression of Robo 4 in the tumor vascular network, our analyses showed that in PCa Robo 4 is not only expressed in the tumor stroma but also in cancer epithelial cells. This finding was also confirmed in vitro as PC3 PCa cells express Robo 4 on mRNA as well as protein level. Overexpression of Robo 4 in PC3 as well as in Robo 4 negative DU145 and LNCaP PCa cells was associated with a significant decrease in cell-proliferation and cell-viability. Conclusion: In summary we observed that Robo 4 plays a considerable role in PCa development as it is expressed in cancer epithelial cells as well as in the surrounding tumor stroma. Moreover, higher histological tumor grade was associated with increased Robo 4 expression; controversially patients with high Robo 4 tend to exert lower biochemical recurrence possibly reflecting a protective role of Robo 4.""","""['Andreas Pircher', 'Georg Schäfer', 'Andrea Eigentler', 'Renate Pichler', 'Martin Puhr', 'Eberhard Steiner', 'Wolfgang Horninger', 'Eberhard Gunsilius', 'Helmut Klocker', 'Isabel Heidegger']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Int J Med Sci""","""['Human antigen R is positively associated with malignant aggressiveness via upregulation of cell proliferation, migration, and vascular endothelial growth factors and cyclooxygenase-2 in prostate cancer.', 'Expression and roles of Slit/Robo in human ovarian cancer.', 'Robo1/Robo4: differential expression of angiogenic markers in colorectal cancer.', 'Potential role of the Slit/Robo signal pathway in angiogenesis.', 'Function of Slit/Robo signaling in breast cancer.', 'Development of a basement membrane gene signature and identification of the potential candidate therapeutic targets for pancreatic cancer.', 'Binding and Efficacy of Anti-Robo4 CAR-T Cells against Solid Tumors.', 'Regulatory mechanisms of Robo4 and their effects on angiogenesis.']"""

Results were interpreted with respect to established thresholds for clinical meaningfulness.  Methods:   A cross-sectional design was used. Patients completed surveys collecting demographics, cancer type, treatment, comorbid conditions, distress (HADS), and HRQoL (FACT-G). Hierarchical multivariate regressions examined associations between cancer type, treatment, and distress on HRQoL. Established minimum differences were used to identify clinically meaningful changes in HRQoL.  Results:   Of the 1183 patients surveyed, 21% were classified as having elevated anxiety and 13% had elevated depression. Our sample reported significantly lower physical and emotional well-being compared to population norms. Patients with prostate, melanoma, gynaecological, and urological cancers had higher HRQoL scores than those with colorectal cancer. However, when effects for treatment type and distress were considered, differences between cancer types became non-significant. Anxiety and depression were associated with lower HRQoL scores as was chemotherapy. Only depression, anxiety, and chemotherapy were associated with clinically meaningful decreases in HRQoL scores.  Conclusions:   While statistically significant differences in HRQoL were found between different cancer types, only chemotherapy, anxiety, and depression produced clinically meaningful poorer HRQoL scores.

E2-induced ERK1/2 activation was partially inhibited when cells were pretreated with ERα- or ERβ-selective antagonists, and blocked by simultaneous pretreatment with both antagonists, suggesting ERα/β heterodimers formation.

In this study, we developed a novel small-molecule compound BKM1972, which exhibited potent in vitro cytotoxicity in PCa and other cancer cells regardless of their differences in chemo-responsiveness. Mechanistic studies demonstrated that BKM1972 effectively inhibited the expression of anti-apoptotic protein survivin and membrane-bound efflux pump ATP binding cassette B 1 (ABCB1, p-glycoprotein), presumably via signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (Stat3). BKM1972 was well tolerated in mice and as a monotherapy, significantly inhibited the intraosseous growth of chemosensitive and chemoresistant PCa cells.

GSCs persist in a hypoxic microenvironment which promotes extracellular adenosine production and activation of the A3 Adenosine Receptor (A3AR), therefore, the aim of this study was to determine the role of extracellular adenosine and A3AR on GSCs invasion under hypoxia. GSCs were obtained from a U87MG cell line and primary cultures of GBM patients, and then incubated under normoxia or hypoxia. Gene expression was evaluated by RNAseq, RT-qPCR, and western blot. Cell migration was measured by spreading and transwell boyden chamber assays; cell invasion was evaluated by Matrigel-coated transwell, ex vivo brain slice, and in vivo xenograft assays. The contribution of A3AR on cell migration/invasion was evaluated using the A3AR antagonist, MRS1220. Extracellular adenosine production was higher under hypoxia than normoxia, mainly by the catalytic action of the prostatic acid phosphatase (PAP), promoting cell migration/invasion in a HIF-2-dependent process. A3AR blockade decreased cell migration/invasion and the expression of Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition markers. In conclusion, high levels of extracellular adenosine production enhance cell migration/invasion of GSCs, through HIF-2/PAP-dependent activation of A3AR under hypoxia.""","""['Ángelo Torres', 'Jose Ignacio Erices', 'Fabiola Sanchez', 'Pamela Ehrenfeld', 'Laurent Turchi', 'Thierry Virolle', 'Daniel Uribe', 'Ignacio Niechi', 'Carlos Spichiger', 'José Dellis Rocha', 'Marcos Ramirez', 'Flavio Salazar-Onfray', 'Rody San Martín', 'Claudia Quezada']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Cancer Lett""","""['The Adenosine A₃ Receptor Regulates Differentiation of Glioblastoma Stem-Like Cells to Endothelial Cells under Hypoxia.', 'Adenosine A3 receptor elicits chemoresistance mediated by multiple resistance-associated protein-1 in human glioblastoma stem-like cells.', 'Adenosine Depletion as A New Strategy to Decrease Glioblastoma Stem-Like Cells Aggressiveness.', 'Hypoxia in the glioblastoma microenvironment: shaping the phenotype of cancer stem-like cells.', 'The hypoxic peri-arteriolar glioma stem cell niche, an integrated concept of five types of niches in human glioblastoma.', 'Therapeutic targeting of P2X4 receptor and mitochondrial metabolism in clear cell renal carcinoma models.', 'Glioblastoma Microenvironment and Invasiveness: New Insights and Therapeutic Targets.', 'Expert opinion on translational research for advanced glioblastoma treatment.', 'Cancer Stem Cell and Aggressiveness Traits Are Promoted by Stable Endothelin-Converting Enzyme-1c in Glioblastoma Cells.', 'Purinergic signaling: Diverse effects and therapeutic potential in cancer.']"""

In men with a prebiopsy positive mpMRI a TBx only approach, thereby omitting transrectal ultrasound-guided systematic biopsy (SBx), has been postulated. In this study we evaluated the additional clinical relevance of SBx in men with a positive prebiopsy mpMRI (Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System [PI-RADS] ≥ 3) undergoing TBx for CaP detection, Gleason grading and CaP localization.  Material and methods:   Prospective data of 255 consecutive men with a prebiopsy positive mpMRI (PI-RADS ≥ 3) undergoing 12-core SBx and subsequent MRI-transrectal ultrasound fusion TBx in 2 institutions between 2015 and 2018 was obtained. The detection rate for significant CaP (Gleason score [GS] ≥ 3 + 4) for TBx and SBx were compared. The rate of potentially missed significant CaP by a TBx only approach was determined and GS concordance and CaP localization by TBx and SBx was evaluated.  Results:   TBx yielded significant CaP in 113 men (44%) while SBx yielded significant CaP in 110 men (43%) (P = 0.856). Insignificant CaP was found in 21 men (8%) by TBx, while SBx detected 34 men (13%) with insignificant CaP (P = 0.035). A TBx only approach, omitting SBx, would have missed significant CaP in 13 of the 126 men (10%) with significant CaP on biopsy. Ten of the 118 men (8%), both positive on TBx and SBx, were upgraded in GS by SBx while 11 men (9%) had higher maximum tumor core involvement on SBx. Nineteen of the 97 men (20%) with significant CaP in both TBx and SBx were diagnosed with unilateral significant CaP on mpMRI and TBx while SBx demonstrated bilateral significant CaP.  Conclusions:   In men with a prebiopsy positive mpMRI, TBx detects high-GS CaP while reducing insignificant CaP detection as compared to SBx. SBx and TBx as stand-alone missed significant CaP in 13% and 10% of the men with significant CaP on biopsy, respectively. A combination of SBx and TBx remains necessary for the most accurate assessment of detection, grading, tumor core involvement, and localization of CaP.""","""['Christophe K Mannaerts', 'Amir Kajtazovic', 'Olivia A P Lodeizen', 'Maudy Gayet', 'Marc R W Engelbrecht', 'Gerrit J Jager', 'Hessel Wijkstra', 'Theo M de Reijke', 'Harrie P Beerlage']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Urol Oncol""","""['Prostate Cancer Risk Assessment in Biopsy-naïve Patients: The Rotterdam Prostate Cancer Risk Calculator in Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging-Transrectal Ultrasound (TRUS) Fusion Biopsy and Systematic TRUS Biopsy.', 'Prostate cancer detection rate in men undergoing transperineal template-guided saturation and targeted prostate biopsy.', 'Detection of clinically significant prostate cancer in biopsy-naïve men: direct comparison of systematic biopsy, multiparametric MRI- and contrast-ultrasound-dispersion imaging-targeted biopsy.', 'Magnetic resonance imaging-transrectal ultrasound image fusion guidance of prostate biopsies: current status, challenges and future perspectives.', 'Magnetic resonance imaging-targeted biopsy may enhance the diagnostic accuracy of significant prostate cancer detection compared to standard transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsy: a systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Performance of multiparametric prostate magnetic resonance imaging validated by targeted and systematic transperineal biopsies.', 'More Space, Less Noise-New-generation Low-Field Magnetic Resonance Imaging Systems Can Improve Patient Comfort: A Prospective 0.55T-1.5T-Scanner Comparison.', 'An optimized prostate biopsy strategy in patients with a unilateral lesion on prostate magnetic resonance imaging avoids unnecessary biopsies.', 'Transrectal Ultrasound in Prostate Cancer: Current Utilization, Integration with mpMRI, HIFU and Other Emerging Applications.', 'Evidence-based guideline recommendations on multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging in the diagnosis of clinically significant prostate cancer: A Cancer Care Ontario updated clinical practice guideline.']"""

Methods:   Twenty-nine men with unilateral CaP (all clinically significant with prostate volume <60 cc) were enrolled in a prospective observational trial of hemi-gland cryotherapy. Mean patient age was 68.7 years. Median prostate-specific antigen (PSA) was 6.6 ng/mL. MRI-guided biopsy (3T-MRI, Artemis US fusion) was used for diagnosis and repeated at 6-month follow-up in all men. Treatment was under general anesthesia using the BTG/Galil system. Validated questionnaires were used to determine effects of treatment on urinary and sexual function and quality of life.  Results:   Cryotherapy was completed satisfactorily in all 29 cases in <60 minutes with no intraoperative complications. Significant decreases in PSA (median decrease 5.6 ng/mL) and PSA density (median decrease 0.14 ng/mL/cc) were observed (P < .01). At 6 months, 23 patients (79%) demonstrated no residual cancer on follow-up MRI-guided biopsy of the treated side. Three patients (10%) revealed micro-residual disease. Three patients (10%) had residual cancer and underwent further treatment. Ipsilateral MRI lesions were present before treatment in 26 patients and after treatment in only 2, reflecting the gross ablative effect; however, MRI showed disappearance of lesions in 4 patients with residual tumor on biopsy. The single complication was 1 case of transient urinary retention; 85% of men who were sexually active continued without change after treatment. Voiding function was unchanged.

To develop a side-specific predictive model, we ultimately considered four variables: prostate-specific antigen, highest ipsilateral biopsy Gleason grade, highest ipsilateral percentage core involvement and seminal vesicle invasion on multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging. A binary multivariable logistic regression model was fitted to predict seminal vesicle invasion. A nomogram was then built based on the coefficients of the resulting logit function. The leave-one-out cross validation method was used for internal validation, and the decision curve analysis for the evaluation of the net clinical benefit.  Results:   We relied on 804 side-specific cases after excluding negative biopsy observations (n = 284). Seminal vesicle invasion was reported on multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging in 41 (5%) cases, and on final pathology in 64 (8%) cases. All variables in the model emerged as predictors of seminal vesicle invasion (all P ≤ 0.001) and were subsequently considered to build a nomogram. The area under the curve of multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging alone in predicting seminal vesicle invasion was 59.1%; whereas one of the clinical variables only was 85.1%. The area under the curve of the nomogram resulting from their combination was 86.5%. After internal validation, this resulted in 84.7%. The model achieved good calibration and the decision curve analysis showed its clinical benefit, especially when compared with relying only on multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging prediction of seminal vesicle invasion.

By converting testosterone (T) into more potent androgen dihydrotestosterone (DHT), it plays an important role in men physiology and represents an efficient therapeutic target for androgen-dependent diseases. Over the last few years, significant efforts have been made in order to develop 5AR inhibitors (5ARI) to treat Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia because of excessive production of DHT.  Methods:   In the present study, 2D and 3D QSAR pharmacophore models have been generated for 5ARI based on known IC50 values with extensive validations. The four featured 2D pharmacophore based PLS model correlated the topological interactions (SsOHE-index); semi empirical (Quadrupole2) and physicochemical descriptors (Mol. Wt, Bromines Count, Chlorines Count) with 5AR inhibitory activity, and has the highest correlation coefficient (r2 = 0.98, q2 =0.84; F = 57.87, pred r2 = 0.88). Internal and external validation was carried out using test and proposed set of compounds. The contribution plot of electrostatic field effects and steric interactions generated by 3D-QSAR showed interesting results in terms of internal and external predictability. The well-validated 2D PLS, and 3D kNN models were used to search novel 5AR inhibitors with different chemical scaffold. The compounds were further sorted by applying ADMET properties and in vitro cytotoxicity studies against prostate cancer cell lines PC-3. Molecular docking studies have also been employed to investigate the binding interactions and to study the stability of docked conformation in detail.  Results:   Several important hydrophobic and hydrogen bond interactions with 5AR lead to the identification of active binding sites of 4AT0 protein in the docked complex, which include the gatekeeper residues ALA 63A (Chain A: ALA63), THR 60 A (Chain A: THR60), and ARG 456 A (Chain A: ARG456), at the hinge region.

We assumed occult cases might take 1-2 years (latency period) to become clinically detectable after receiving TRT. We selected several latency periods (12/18/24 months) and compared the risk of PCa in the TRT and non-TRT group over the latency period, from the end of latency period till the end of follow-up, and over the whole follow-up time.  Results:   Overall, 26 PCa cases occurred in the non-TRT group vs 9 cases in the TRT group.

Here, we show that only lowly expressed alternatively spliced MIR205HG transcripts act as de facto pri-miRNAs, through a process that involves Drosha to prevent unfavorable splicing and directly mediate miR-205 excision. Notably, MIR205HG-specific processed transcripts revealed to be functional per se as nuclear long noncoding RNA capable of regulating differentiation of human prostate basal cells through control of the interferon pathway. At molecular level, MIR205HG directly binds the promoters of its target genes, which have an Alu element in proximity of the Interferon-Regulatory Factor (IRF) binding site, and represses their transcription likely buffering IRF1 activity, with the ultimate effect of preventing luminal differentiation. As MIR205HG functions autonomously from (albeit complementing) miR-205 in preserving the basal identity of prostate epithelial cells, it warrants reannotation as LEADeR (Long Epithelial Alu-interacting Differentiation-related RNA).""","""['Valentina Profumo', 'Barbara Forte', 'Stefano Percio', 'Federica Rotundo', 'Valentina Doldi', 'Elena Ferrari', 'Nicola Fenderico', 'Matteo Dugo', 'Dario Romagnoli', 'Matteo Benelli', 'Riccardo Valdagni', 'Diletta Dolfini', 'Nadia Zaffaroni', 'Paolo Gandellini']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Nat Commun""","""['MIR205HG/LEADR Long Noncoding RNA Binds to Primed Proximal Regulatory Regions in Prostate Basal Cells Through a Triplex- and Alu-Mediated Mechanism.', 'Gene expression dataset of prostate cells upon MIR205HG/LEADR modulation.', 'MIR205HG Is a Long Noncoding RNA that Regulates Growth Hormone and Prolactin Production in the Anterior Pituitary.', 'Regulation of the MIR155 host gene in physiological and pathological processes.', 'CRISPR links to long noncoding RNA function in mice: A practical approach.', 'Identification of lncRNAs Deregulated in Epithelial Ovarian Cancer Based on a Gene Expression Profiling Meta-Analysis.', 'Navigating the Multiverse of Antisense RNAs: The Transcription- and RNA-Dependent Dimension.', 'Long non-coding RNA SNHG3 promotes prostate cancer progression by sponging microRNA-1827.', 'MIR205HG/LEADR Long Noncoding RNA Binds to Primed Proximal Regulatory Regions in Prostate Basal Cells Through a Triplex- and Alu-Mediated Mechanism.', 'Epithelial cells-enriched lncRNA SNHG8 regulates chromatin condensation by binding to Histone H1s.']"""

Oxidative stress has been recognized as one of the driving signals pathologically linked to PCa progression. Nevertheless, the association of oxidative stress with PCa progression remains unclear.  Methods:   Western blot, q-RT-PCR and bioinformatics analyses were used to examine PAGE4 expression. Comet assay and Annexin V/ PI dual staining assay were performed to investigate DNA damage and cell death under oxidative stress. Mouse xenograft model of PCa cells was established to verify the role of PAGE4 in vivo. Transcriptomic analysis was performed to investigate the underlying mechanism for the function of PAGE4 under oxidative stress. Western blot assay was conducted to determine the status of MAPK pathway. Immunohistochemistry was used to identify protein expression of PAGE4 in tumor tissues.  Results:   In this study, we found that PAGE4 expression was increased in PCa cells under oxidative stress condition. PAGE4 overexpression protected PCa cells from oxidative stress-inducing cell death by reducing DNA damage. PAGE4 overexpression promoted PCa cells growth in vivo. Mechanistically, PAGE4 promoted the survival of prostate cancer cells through regulating MAPK pathway which reflected in decreasing the phosphorylation of MAP2K4, JNK and c-JUN but increasing phosphorylation of ERK1/2.

This inhibition prevents the phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma protein (pRb), resulting in cellular senescence through inhibition of E2F-mediated transcription of S phase genes required for cell proliferation. The p16Ink4a plays an important role in tumor suppression, whereby its deletion, mutation, or epigenetic silencing is a frequently observed genetic alteration in prostate cancer. To assess its roles and related molecular mechanisms in prostate cancer initiation and progression, we generated a mouse model with conditional deletion of p16Ink4a in prostatic luminal epithelium. The mice underwent oncogenic transformation and developed prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) from eight months of age, but failed to develop prostatic tumors. Given the prevalence of aberrant androgen signaling pathways in prostate cancer initiation and progression, we then generated R26hARL/wt:p16L/L: PB-Cre4 compound mice, in which conditional expression of the human AR transgene and deletion of p16Ink4a co-occur in prostatic luminal epithelial cells. While R26hARL/wt:PB-Cre4 mice showed no visible pathological changes, R26hARL/wt:p16L/L: PB-Cre4 compound mice displayed an early onset of high-grade PIN (HGPIN), prostatic carcinoma, and metastatic lesions. Strikingly, we observed tumors resembling human sarcomatoid carcinoma with intermixed focal regions of signet ring cell carcinoma (SRCC) in the prostates of the compound mice. Further characterization of these tumors showed they were of luminal epithelial cell origin, and featured characteristics of epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) with enhanced proliferative and invasive capabilities.

Methods::   Five therapeutic radiographers contoured the prostate individually on CT, T2 weighted (T2W) and T2* weighted (T2*W) imaging for 10 patients. Contours were analysed with Monaco ADMIRE (research v. 2.0) to assess interobserver variability and accuracy by comparison with a gold standard clinician contour. Observers recorded time taken for contouring and scored image quality and confidence in contouring.  Results::   There is good agreement when comparing radiographer contours to the gold-standard for all three imaging types with Dice similarity co-efficient 0.91-0.94, Cohen's κ 0.85-0.91, Hausdorff distance 4.6-7.6 mm and mean distance between contours 0.9-1.2 mm. In addition, there is good concordance between radiographers across all imaging modalities. Both T2W and T2*W MRI show reduced interobserver variability and improved accuracy compared to CT, this was statistically significant for T2*W imaging compared to CT across all four comparison metrics. Comparing MRI sequences reveals significantly reduced interobserver variability and significantly improved accuracy on T2*W compared to T2W MRI for DSC and Cohen's κ. Both MRI sequences scored significantly higher compared to CT for image quality and confidence in contouring, particularly T2*W. This was also reflected in the shorter time for contouring, measuring 15.4, 9.6 and 9.8 min for CT, T2W and T2*W MRI respectively. Conclusion: Therapeutic radiographer prostate contours are more accurate, show less interobserver variability and are more confidently and quickly outlined on MRI compared to CT, particularly using T2*W MRI.

At our institution we performed a prospective phase II study of 2 years of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), pelvic radiation, Cesium (Cs)-131 brachytherapy boost, and adjuvant docetaxel in high risk, localized prostate cancer with a primary endpoint of 3-year disease-free survival.  Materials/methods:   Acute/chronic hematologic, gastrointestinal (GI) and genitourinary (GU) toxicities were scored based on the CTCAE v3.0/RTOG-EORTC criteria, respectively. Actuarial biochemical recurrence free survival (bRFS), bRFSdisease free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) were calculated. Patients had a median age of 62 years (range, 45 to 82), median Gleason score 8 (74% Gleason 8-10), median PSA of 11.2 (range, 2.8 to 96), and 47% cT2-T3a stage disease.

Material and methods:   We identified 7, 350 men who underwent RP at our institution between 1994 and 2012 and had a prostate biopsy within one year of surgery. Patients were grouped into five time intervals for analysis: ≤ 3 weeks, 4-6 weeks, 7-12 weeks, 12-26 weeks, and > 26 weeks. Oncologic outcomes were stratified by NCCN disease risk for comparison. The associations of time interval with clinicopathologic features and survival were evaluated using multivariate logistic and Cox regression analyses.  Results:   Median time from biopsy to surgery was 61 days (IQR 37, 84). Median followup after RP was 7.1 years (IQR 4.2, 11.7) while the overall perioperative complication rate was 19.7% (1,448/7,350). Adjusting for pre-operative variables, men waiting 12-26 weeks until RP had the highest likelihood of nerve sparing (OR: 1.45, p = 0.02) while those in the 4-6 week group had higher overall complications (OR: 1.33, p = 0.01).

Survey of genitourinary expert radiation oncologists""","""Introduction:   Several recent randomized clinical trials have evaluated hypofractionated regimens against conventionally fractionated EBRT and shown similar effectiveness with conflicting toxicity results. The current view regarding hypofractionation compared to conventional EBRT among North American genitourinary experts for management of prostate cancer has not been investigated.  Materials and methods:   A survey was distributed to 88 practicing North American GU physicians serving on decision - making committees of cooperative group research organizations. Questions pertained to opinions regarding the default EBRT dose and fractionation for a hypothetical example of a favorable intermediate - risk prostate cancer (Gleason 3 + 4). Treatment recommendations were correlated with practice patterns using Fisher's exact test.  Results:   Forty - two respondents (48%) completed the survey. We excluded from analysis two respondents who selected radical hypofractionation with 5 - 12 fractions as a preferred treatment modality. Among the 40 analyzed respondents, 23 (57.5%) recommend conventional fractionation and 17 (42.5%) recommended moderate hypofractionation. No demographic factors were found to be associated with preference for a fractionation regimen. Support for brachytherapy as a first choice treatment modality for low - risk prostate cancer was borderline significantly associated with support for moderate hypofractionated EBRT treatment modality (p = 0.089).  Conclusions:   There is an almost equal split among North American GU expert radiation oncologists regarding the appropriateness to consider moderately hypofractionated EBRT as a new standard of care in management of patients with prostate cancer. Physicians who embrace brachytherapy may be more inclined to support moderate hypofractionated regimen for EBRT. It is unclear whether reports with longer followups will impact this balance, or whether national care and reimbursement policies will drive the clinical decisions. In the day and age of patient - centered care delivery, patients should receive an objective recommendation based on available clinical evidence. The stark division among GU experts may influence the design of future clinical trials utilizing EBRT for patients with prostate cancer.""","""['Shearwood McClelland III', 'Kiri A Sandler', 'Catherine Degnin', 'Yiyi Chen', 'Arthur Y Hung', 'Timur E Mitin']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Int Braz J Urol""","""['Dramatically Polarized Opinion on the Role of Brachytherapy Boost in Management of High-risk Prostate Cancer: A Survey of North American Genitourinary Expert Radiation Oncologists.', 'Acute genitourinary toxicity after high-dose-rate (HDR) brachytherapy combined with hypofractionated external-beam radiation therapy for localized prostate cancer: correlation between the urethral dose in HDR brachytherapy and the severity of acute genitourinary toxicity.', 'Active Surveillance for Low and Intermediate Risk Prostate Cancer: Opinions of North American Genitourinary Oncology Expert Radiation Oncologists.', 'A systematic review of hypofractionation for primary management of prostate cancer.', 'Hypofractionated radiotherapy for prostate cancer in the postoperative setting: What is the evidence so far?', 'Bowel and Bladder Reproducibility in Image Guided Radiation Therapy for Prostate Cancer: Results of a Patterns of Practice Survey.']"""

Purpose:   To report the experience of two referral centers adopting two different RARP approaches in KTRs. Surgical, oncological and functional results were primary outcomes evaluated in the study.  Material and methods:   We retrospectively analyzed data from 9 KTRs who underwent transperitoneal RARP or Retzius-sparing RARP for PCa from October 2012 to April 2016. Data were reported as median and interquartile range (IQR). Pre- and postoperative outcomes were compared by non-parametric Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Significant differences were accepted when p ≤ 0.05. Overall survival was assessed using Kaplan-Meier method.  Results:   Four KTRs underwent a T-RARP and 5 a RS-RARP. Patient median age was 60 (56-63) years. Charlson comorbidity index was 6 (5-6). Preoperative median PSA was 5.6 (5-15) ng / mL.

Materials and methods:   The study included 107 node-negative patients treated with SRT after RP at a single institution. Patients received SRT for either prostate-specific antigen (PSA) rising, or PSA persistence after RP. All patients received local radiation to the prostate / seminal vesicle bed. The primary measured outcome was the biochemical recurrence (BCR) free survival. Multivariable Cox regression analysis was used to develop a risk-stratification group to identify predictive factors associated with the probability of BCR at 5yr.  Results:   At a median follow-up of 52 months, the BCR free survival rate and overall survival in 5 years was 73% and 94%, respectively. At multivariable analysis, pre-SRT PSA level > 0.35ng / mL (p = 0.023), negative margins (p = 0.038), and seminal vesicles invasion (p = 0.001) were significantly associated with BCR free survival. Three risk groups using regression analysis for SRT administration was built. Low-, intermediateand the high-risk groups had a BCR free survival in 5-years of 96%, 84%, and 44% (p = 0.0001), respectively.  Conclusions:   We developed a risk group stratification to show the impact of SRT based on prostate cancer characteristics. SRT showed to be extremely beneficial for patients with low- and intermediate-risk tumors.

However, it is not practical to identify potential associations using traditional biological experimental methods since the process is expensive and time consuming. Therefore, it is necessary to develop efficient computational methods to accomplish this task. In this work, we introduced a matrix completion model with dual Laplacian regularization (DLRMC) to infer unknown miRNA-disease associations in heterogeneous omics data. Specifically, DLRMC transformed the task of miRNA-disease association prediction into a matrix completion problem, in which the potential missing entries of the miRNA-disease association matrix were calculated, the missing association can be obtained based on the prediction scores after the completion procedure. Meanwhile, the miRNA functional similarity and the disease semantic similarity were fully exploited to serve the miRNA-disease association matrix completion by using a dual Laplacian regularization term. In the experiments, we conducted global and local Leave-One-Out Cross Validation (LOOCV) and case studies to evaluate the efficacy of DLRMC on the Human miRNA-disease associations dataset obtained from the HMDDv2.0 database. As a result, the AUCs of DLRMC is 0.9174 and 0.8289 in global LOOCV and local LOOCV, respectively, which significantly outperform a variety of previous methods. In addition, in the case studies on four significant diseases related to human health including Colon Neoplasms, Kidney neoplasms, Lymphoma and Prostate neoplasms, 90%, 92%, 92% and 94% out of the top 50 predicted miRNAs has been confirmed, respectively.""","""['Chang Tang', 'Hua Zhou', 'Xiao Zheng', 'Yanming Zhang', 'Xiaofeng Sha']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""RNA Biol""","""['MCMDA: Matrix completion for MiRNA-disease association prediction.', 'GIMDA: Graphlet interaction-based MiRNA-disease association prediction.', 'MDHGI: Matrix Decomposition and Heterogeneous Graph Inference for miRNA-disease association prediction.', 'Review of MiRNA-Disease Association Prediction.', 'MicroRNAs and complex diseases: from experimental results to computational models.', 'KATZNCP: a miRNA-disease association prediction model integrating KATZ algorithm and network consistency projection.', 'LSGSP: a novel miRNA-disease association prediction model using a Laplacian score of the graphs and space projection federated method.', 'MSFSP: A Novel miRNA-Disease Association Prediction Model by Federating Multiple-Similarities Fusion and Space Projection.', 'GBDTL2E: Predicting lncRNA-EF Associations Using Diffusion and HeteSim Features Based on a Heterogeneous Network.', 'PESM: predicting the essentiality of miRNAs based on gradient boosting machines and sequences.']"""

The present study aimed to evaluate the hypothesis that ASPM serves a critical role in cancer invasiveness and may act as a prognostic biomarker in bladder cancer. In total, 6 independent worldwide bladder cancer microarray mRNA expression datasets (n=1,355) with clinical and follow-up annotations were collected from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) databases. Reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis revealed that ASPM mRNA expression was higher in bladder cancer tissue compared with adjacent normal bladder mucosae in 10 paired human tissue samples (P=0.004). ASPM overexpression in human bladder cancer samples was consistent with the mRNA expression datasets from GEO and TCGA. Bioinformatics analysis indicated that ASPM mRNA expression was significantly associated with grade and tumor node metastasis (TNM) stage in bladder cancer, based on pooled GEO and TCGA datasets (P<0.05). Stratification analysis indicated that the clinical significance of ASPM was particularly pronounced in low-grade or papillary subtypes of bladder cancer. Individual Cox and pooled Kaplan-Meier analyses suggested that ASPM expression was significantly directly correlated with poor overall (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) in bladder cancer. Multivariate and stratification analyses demonstrated that the prognostic significance of ASPM was evident in low-grade or papillary bladder cancers, yet not in high-grade or non-papillary subgroups. Increased expression of ASPM was associated with poor OS in muscle-invasive bladder cancer and with poor PFS in non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (P<0.05). Bioinformatics analysis identified the top 11 ASPM-related genes on STRING-DB.org. The expression of the majority of these genes was associated with poor outcomes of bladder cancer with statistical significance. Gene set enrichment analysis indicated that the high expression of ASPM could enrich gene signatures involved in mitosis, differentiation and metastasis in bladder cancer. Further analysis of TCGA datasets indicated that increased ASPM expression was significantly associated with higher Gleason score, T stage, N stage and poor clinical outcome in prostate cancer. It was also significantly associated with late TNM stage and poor PFS in renal cell carcinoma. In summary, ASPM may serve as a novel prognostic biomarker for low-grade or papillary bladder cancer.""","""['Zhenglin Xu', 'Qi Zhang', 'Frank Luh', 'Baiye Jin', 'Xiyong Liu']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Oncol Lett""","""['Screening ANLN and ASPM as bladder urothelial carcinoma-related biomarkers based on weighted gene co-expression network analysis.', 'Abnormal spindle-like microcephaly-associated protein promotes proliferation by regulating cell cycle in epithelial ovarian cancer.', 'Overexpression of abnormal spindle-like microcephaly-associated (ASPM) increases tumor aggressiveness and predicts poor outcome in patients with lung adenocarcinoma.', 'High expression of ASPM correlates with tumor progression and predicts poor outcome in patients with prostate cancer.', 'Low microRNA-139 expression associates with poor prognosis in patients with tumors: A meta-analysis.', 'Improvement of variables interpretability in kernel PCA.', 'Screening ANLN and ASPM as bladder urothelial carcinoma-related biomarkers based on weighted gene co-expression network analysis.', 'Differentially expressed discriminative genes and significant meta-hub genes based key genes identification for hepatocellular carcinoma using statistical machine learning.', 'Identification of Potential Biomarkers for Pan-Cancer Diagnosis and Prognosis Through the Integration of Large-Scale Transcriptomic Data.', 'Abnormal spindle-like microcephaly-associated protein promotes proliferation by regulating cell cycle in epithelial ovarian cancer.']"""

Yet eventually most patients may fail with development of Enz resistance. While recent clinical studies indicated that the increased expression of the androgen receptor (AR) splicing variant ARv7 might have key roles for the development of Enz resistance in CRPC, its detailed mechanism, especially its linkage to the circular RNAs (circRNAs), a form of non-coding RNA, however, remains unclear. Here we found from human clinical sample survey that circRNA17 (hsa_circ_0001427) has a lower expression in higher Gleason score PCa, and results from in vitro cell lines studies also revealed the lower expression in CRPC C4-2 Enz-resistant (EnzR-C4-2) cells compared to their parental Enz-sensitive (EnzS-C4-2) cells. Mechanism dissection indicated that suppressing circRNA17 in EnzS-C4-2 cells increased ARv7 expression that might then lead to increase the Enz resistance and cell invasion. Mechanism dissection demonstrated that Enz could suppress the circRNA17 expression at the transcriptional level via suppressing transcription of its host gene PDLIM5, and circRNA17 could regulate ARv7 expression via altering the expression of miR-181c-5p that involved the direct binding of miR-181c-5p to the 3'UTR of ARv7. Preclinical study using in vivo mouse model with xenografted EnzR-CWR22Rv1 cells revealed that adding circRNA17 or miRNA-181c-5p could suppress the EnzR-CWR22Rv1 cells growth.

Most preclinical in vivo HT studies use subcutaneous tumor models which do not adequately represent clinical conditions (e.g. proximity of normal/critical organs) or replicate the tumor microenvironment-both of which are important factors for eventual clinical translation. The purpose of this work is to demonstrate proof-of-concept of locoregional radiosensitization with superficially applied, radiofrequency (RF)-induced HT in an orthotopic mouse model of prostate cancer.  Methods::   In a 4-arm study, 40 athymic male nude mice were inoculated in the prostate with luciferase-transfected human prostate cancer cells (PC3). Tumor volumes were allowed to reach 150-250 mm3 (as measured by ultrasound) following which, mice were randomized into (i) control (no intervention); (ii) HT alone; (iii) RT alone; and (iv) HT + RT. RF-induced HT was administered (Groups ii and iv) using the Oncotherm LAB EHY-100 device to achieve a target temperature of 41 °C in the prostate. RT was administered ~30 min following HT, using an image-guided small animal radiotherapy research platform. In each case, a dual arc plan was used to deliver 12 Gy to the target in a single fraction. One animal from each cohort was euthanized on Day 10 or 11 after treatment for caspase-9 and caspase-3 Western blot analysis.  Results::   The inoculation success rate was 89%. Mean tumor size at randomization (~16 days post-inoculation) was ~189 mm3 . Following the administration of RT and HT, mean tumor doubling times in days were: control = 4.2; HT = 4.5; RT = 30.4; and HT + RT = 33.4. A significant difference (p = 0.036) was noted between normalized nadir volumes for the RT alone (0.76) and the HT + RT (0.40) groups. Increased caspase-3 expression was seen in the combination treatment group compared to the other treatment groups.  Conclusion::   These early results demonstrate the successful use of external mild HT as a localized radiosensitizer for deep-seated tumors.

In a screening campaign, we identified that DD1E5 (3-amino-6- tert-butyl-N-(1,3-thiazol-2-yl)-4-(trifluoromethyl)thieno[2,3- b]pyridine-2- carboxamide) inhibits the DDAH1 activity both in vitro and in cultured cells. Mechanistic studies found that DD1E5 is a competitive inhibitor (dissociation constant ( Ki) of 2.05 ± 0.15 μM). Enzyme kinetic assays showed time and concentration dependent inhibition of DDAH1 with DD1E5, which shows tight binding with an inactivation rate constant of 0.2756 ± 0.015 M-1 S-1. Treatment of cancer cells with DDAH1 inhibitors shows inhibition of cell proliferation and a subsequent decrease in NO production with ADMA accumulation. DD1E5 reversed the elevated VEGF, c-Myc, HIF-1α, and iNOS levels induced by exogenous DDAH1 overexpression in PCa cells. Moreover, DD1E5 significantly increased intracellular levels of ADMA and reduced NO production, suggesting its therapeutic potential for cancers in which DDAH1 is upregulated. In in vitro assays, DD1E5 abrogated the secretion of angiogenic factors (bFGF and IL-8) into conditional media, indicating its antiangiogenic potential. DD1E5 inhibited in vivo growth of xenograft tumors derived from PCa cells with DDAH1 overexpression, by reducing tumor endothelial content represented with low CD31 expression. VEGF, HIF-1α, and iNOS expression were reversed in DD1E5 treated tumors compared to respective control tumors. In this work, integrating multiple approaches shows DD1E5 is a promising tool for the study of methylarginine-mediated NO control and a potential therapeutic lead compound against pathological conditions with elevated NO production such as cancers and other diseases.""","""['Karthik Reddy Kami Reddy', 'Chandrashekhar Dasari', 'Shalini Vandavasi', 'Sirisha Natani', 'Bhukya Supriya', 'Surender Singh Jadav', 'N Sai Ram', 'Jerald Mahesh Kumar', 'Ramesh Ummanni']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""ACS Comb Sci""","""['Dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase-1 (DDAH1) is frequently upregulated in prostate cancer, and its overexpression conveys tumor growth and angiogenesis by metabolizing asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA).', 'Repetitive ischemia increases myocardial dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase 1 expression.', 'HIF-1α and Nrf2 regulates hypoxia induced overexpression of DDAH1 through promoter activation in prostate cancer.', 'Effect of asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) on heart failure development.', 'The DDAH/ADMA pathway in the control of endothelial cell migration and angiogenesis.', 'DIGE-Based Biomarker Discovery in Blood Cancers.', 'Tumor cell-derived asymmetric dimethylarginine regulates macrophage functions and polarization.', 'Endothelial YAP/TAZ Signaling in Angiogenesis and Tumor Vasculature.', 'Inhibition of Dimethylarginine Dimethylaminohydrolase (DDAH) Enzymes as an Emerging Therapeutic Strategy to Target Angiogenesis and Vasculogenic Mimicry in Cancer.', 'The Second Life of Methylarginines as Cardiovascular Targets.']"""

The aim of this study was to assess the predictive value of preoperative 68Ga-PSMA (prostate specific membrane antigen) positron emission tomography/computerized tomography to predict histological metastasis on pelvic lymph node dissection performed during radical prostatectomy.  Materials and methods:   We retrospectively reviewed the sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of preoperative staging 68Ga-PSMA positron emission tomography/computerized tomography to identify histological lymph node metastasis in 208 consecutive men who subsequently proceeded with pelvic lymph node dissection at radical prostatectomy.  Results:   Median prostate specific antigen was 7.6 μg/l, the lymph node count was 13 and Gleason score was 4 + 5. On a per patient basis only 21 of the 55 men with metastasis on histological examination were identified on 68Ga-PSMA positron emission tomography/computerized tomography for 38.2% sensitivity. Of the 143 men with no lymph node metastasis on 68Ga-PSMA imaging 34 had metastasis on histology for 80.8% negative predictive value. Specificity was 93.5% and positive predictive value was 67.7%. For the 172 histologically identified malignant lymph node metastases the sensitivity per node was 24.4% and specificity was 99.5%.  Conclusions:   If negative 68Ga-PSMA positron emission tomography/computerized tomography is used as the basis of not performing pelvic lymph node dissection, 80% of men would avoid unnecessary pelvic lymph node dissection. However, 68Ga-PSMA positron emission tomography/computerized tomography has poor sensitivity per node to detect all histologically positive lymph node metastases.

First, AuNPs were coated onto the surfaces of 96-well plates to generate rough surfaces, which enable immobilization of many more capture antibodies than a smooth substrate. As a result, detection sensitivity was enhanced significantly. Second, the horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated detection antibodies were labeled on large-size AuNPs, which increase the localized amounts of HRP and thus further lower the detection limit. Based on the consecutive signal amplification system, a high-sensitivity assay was achieved, with a LOD of 0.07 ng/mL for prostate-specific antigen (PSA).

Results:   During a median follow-up of 9.1 years, biochemical recurrence occurred in 67 patients (40.4%) and disease progression occurred in 55 patients (33.1%). In all groups, 10-year RFS and 10-year PFS were significantly lower for PI-RADS scores ≥ 3, ≥ 4 and 5 than for score < 3, < 4 and < 5 (p <0.05), respectively. In multivariate analysis, PI-RADS score ≥ 3 and score 5 were significant independent risk marker for biochemical recurrence (hazard ratio [HR] = 5.58, p = 0.018; HR = 1.75, p = 0.033) and disease progression (HR = 3.99, p = 0.047; HR = 2.31, p = 0.040). Moderate inter-observer agreement was seen for PI-RADS scoring.  Conclusion:   PI-RADS v2 may be used to predict long-term outcomes following RP in PCa.""","""['Ran Kim', 'Chan Kyo Kim', 'Jung Jae Park', 'Jae Hun Kim', 'Seong Il Seo', 'Seong Soo Jeon', 'Hyun Moo Lee']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Korean J Radiol""","""['Prediction of biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy with PI-RADS version 2 in prostate cancers: initial results.', 'Biparametric Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System version2 and International Society of Urological Pathology Grade Predict Biochemical Recurrence after Radical\xa0Prostatectomy.', 'PI-RADS Version 2 Category on 3 Tesla Multiparametric Prostate Magnetic Resonance Imaging Predicts Oncologic Outcomes in Gleason 3 + 4 Prostate Cancer on Biopsy.', 'Prostate Magnetic Resonance Imaging for Local Recurrence Reporting (PI-RR): International Consensus -based Guidelines on Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging for Prostate Cancer Recurrence after Radiation Therapy and Radical Prostatectomy.', 'Association Between Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging of the Prostate and Oncological Outcomes after Primary Treatment for Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.', 'The utility of two-dimensional shear wave elastography for predicting prostate cancer: a preliminary study.', 'The Prognostic Value of PI-RADS Score in CyberKnife Ultra-Hypofractionated Radiotherapy for Localized Prostate Cancer.', 'Mistakes to Avoid for Accurate and Transparent Reporting of Survival Analysis in Imaging Research.', 'MRI Characteristics Accurately Predict Biochemical Recurrence after Radical Prostatectomy.', 'Characteristics of Recent Articles Published in the Korean Journal of Radiology Based on the Citation Frequency.']"""

To date, in most cases, single-chain variable fragments (scFvs) of murine origin have been used in CARs. However, this structure has limitations relating to the potential immunogenicity of mouse antigens in humans and the relatively large size of scFvs. For the first time, we used camelid nanobody (VHH) to construct CAR T cells against prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA). The nanobody against PSMA (NBP) was used to show the feasibility of CAR T cells against prostate cancer cells. T cells were transfected, and then the surface expression of the CAR T cells was confirmed. Then, the functions of VHH-CAR T cell were evaluated upon coculture with prostate cancer cells. At the end, the cytotoxicity potential of NBPII-CAR in T cells was approximated by determining the cell surface expression of CD107a after encountering PSMA. Our data show the specificity of VHH-CAR T cells against PSMA+ cells (LNCaP), not only by increasing the interleukin 2 (IL-2) cytokine (about 400 pg/mL), but also the expression of CD69 by almost 38%. In addition, VHH-CAR T cells were proliferated by nearly 60% when cocultured with LNCaP, as compared with PSMA negative prostate cancer cell (DU-145), which led to the upregulation of CD107a in T cells upto 31%. These results clearly show the possibility of using VHH-based CAR T cells for targeted immunotherapy, which may be developed to target virtually any tumor-associated antigen for adoptive T-cell immunotherapy of solid tumors.""","""['Mahmoud Hassani', 'Fatemeh Hajari Taheri', 'Zahra Sharifzadeh', 'Arash Arashkia', 'Jamshid Hadjati', 'Wytske M van Weerden', 'Mohammad Hossein Modarressi', 'Mohsen Abolhassani']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""J Cell Biochem""","""['Engineered Jurkat Cells for Targeting Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen on Prostate Cancer Cells by Nanobody-Based Chimeric Antigen Receptor.', 'Fully human antibody VH domains to generate mono and bispecific CAR to target solid tumors.', 'T cell engineered with a novel nanobody-based chimeric antigen receptor against VEGFR2 as a candidate for tumor immunotherapy.', 'The application of prostate specific membrane antigen in CART‑cell therapy for treatment of prostate carcinoma (Review).', 'CAR T-cell bioengineering: Single variable domain of heavy chain antibody targeted CARs.', 'In Situ Programming of CAR-T Cells: A Pressing Need in Modern Immunotherapy.', 'Engineered anti-prostate cancer CAR-neutrophils from human pluripotent stem cells.', 'Nanobodies in cell-mediated immunotherapy: On the road to fight cancer.', 'Immunovirotherapy: The role of antibody based therapeutics combination with oncolytic viruses.', 'CAR-T cell potency: from structural elements to vector backbone components.']"""

Our objective was to evaluate the anti-cancer activity of oral curcumin in patients with prostate cancer.  Methods:   This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was performed on patients with prostate cancer who received intermittent androgen deprivation (IAD). Participants who finished the first on-treatment period of IAD were randomized into a curcumin or placebo group. The patients took oral curcumin (1440 mg/day) or placebo for six months and were followed up until the beginning of the second on-treatment. The primary end-point was duration of the first off-treatment. The secondary end-points were change in PSA and testosterone levels during 6 months, PSA progression rate, and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) scores at 6 months. Safety assessments included adverse event, adverse drug reaction, and serious adverse event.  Results:   A total of 97 participants were randomized 1:1 to curcumin (n = 49) and placebo (n = 48) groups. Among them, 82 patients (84.5%) were evaluable for the analysis (39 and 43 patients in the curcumin and placebo groups, respectively). The median off-treatment duration was 16.3 months (95% confidence interval [CI] 12.3-20.3 months) and 18.5 months (95% CI 12.5-23.0 months) in the curcumin and placebo groups, respectively. There was no significant difference in the curve of off-treatment duration between the two groups (P = 0.4816). The proportion of patients with PSA progression during the active curcumin treatment period (6 months) was significantly lower in the curcumin group than the placebo group (10.3% vs 30.2%, P = 0.0259). The change of PSA, testosterone levels during 6 months, and HRQOL scores at 6 months were not different between curcumin and placebo groups. Adverse events were higher in the placebo group (16 of 46 vs 7 of 45 patients, P = 0.0349). No significant differences in the adverse drug reaction were found between the two groups.  Conclusions:   Six months' intake of oral curcumin did not significantly affect the overall off-treatment duration of IAD. However, PSA elevation was suppressed with curcumin intake during the curcumin administration period. Curcumin at this dose was well tolerated and safe.""","""['Young Hyo Choi', 'Deok Hyun Han', 'Seon-Woo Kim', 'Min-Ji Kim', 'Hyun Hwan Sung', 'Hwang Gyun Jeon', 'Byong Chang Jeong', 'Seong Il Seo', 'Seong Soo Jeon', 'Hyun Moo Lee', 'Han Yong Choi']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Degarelix as an intermittent androgen deprivation therapy for one or more treatment cycles in patients with prostate cancer.', 'Intermittent Versus Continuous Androgen Deprivation Therapy in Patients with Relapsing or Locally Advanced Prostate Cancer: A Phase 3b Randomised Study (ICELAND).', 'Factors Predicting the Off-treatment Duration in Patients with Prostate Cancer Receiving Degarelix as Intermittent Androgen Deprivation Therapy.', 'Treatment of prostate cancer with intermittent versus continuous androgen deprivation: a systematic review of randomized trials.', 'Intermittent complete androgen blockade in metastatic prostate cancer.', 'A Systematic Review of Patient Race, Ethnicity, Socioeconomic Status, and Educational Attainment in Prostate Cancer Treatment Randomised Trials-Is the Evidence Base Applicable to the General Patient Population?', 'Pharmacological Mechanisms and Clinical Applications of Curcumin: Update.', 'Exploring the Contribution of Curcumin to Cancer Therapy: A Systematic Review of Randomized Controlled Trials.', 'Role of Turmeric and Curcumin in Prevention and Treatment of Chronic Diseases: Lessons Learned from Clinical Trials.', 'Curcumin Supplementation and Human Disease: A Scoping Review of Clinical Trials.']"""

However, the co-localization of lower grade lesions between mpMRI and histopathologic specimen has not been well established.  Objective:   We aim to determine the factors on final histopathological exam that correlate to tumor visibility for Grade I and II disease on mpMRI.  Methods:   Fifty-five patients who underwent radical prostatectomy from July 2014 to June 2016 were analyzed for the study. Of the sample of 55 patients, 18 were found to have Gleason score (GS) of 3 + 3 or 3 + 4 disease, and then were re-reviewed and annotated by a pathologist. Lesion diameter, area, and distance from the prostate capsule were measured. The annotated lesions were co-localized to the MRI report.  Results:   Of the 184 lesions identified on the whole mount histopathologic slides, 106 (57.6%), 62 (33.7%), 14 (7.6%), and 2 (1.1%) of the lesions had a GS of 3 + 3, 3 + 4, 4 + 3, and 4 + 4, respectively.

Herein, we performed a national survey of specialists about perceived attitudes and use of prediction tools.  Methods:   In 2017, we invited 940 URO and 911 RO in a national survey to query their confidence in and use of the D'Amico criteria, Kattan Nomogram, and CAPRA score. The statistical analysis involved bivariate association and multivariable logistic regression analyses to identify physician characteristics (age, gender, race, practice affiliation, specialty, access to robotic surgery, ownership of linear accelerator and number of prostate cancer per week) associated with survey responses and use of active surveillance (AS) for low-risk PCa.  Results:   Overall, 691 (37.3%) specialists completed the surveys. Two-thirds (range 65.6-68.4%) of respondents reported being ""somewhat confident"", but only a fifth selected ""very confident"" for each prediction tool (18.0-20.1%). 19.1% of specialists in the survey reported not using any prediction tools in clinical practice, which was higher amongst URO than RO (23.9 vs. 13.4%; p < 0.001). Respondents who reported not using prediction tools were also associated with low utilization of AS in their low-risk PCa patients (adjusted OR 2.47; p = 0.01).  Conclusions:   While a majority of RO and URO view existing prediction tools for localized PCa with some degree of confidence, a fifth of specialists reported not using any such tools in clinical practice.

This study aimed to assess the feasibility and acceptability of a theoretically led workbook intervention designed to support patients with cancer returning to work.  Design:   Parallel-group randomised controlled trial with embedded qualitative interviews.  Setting:   Oncology clinics within four English National Health Service Trusts.  Participants:   Patients who had received a diagnosis of breast, gynaecological, prostate or colorectal cancer and who had been receiving treatment for a minimum of two weeks.  Intervention:   A self-guided WorkPlan workbook designed to support patients with cancer to return to work with fortnightly telephone support calls to discuss progress. The control group received treatment as usual and was offered the workbook at the end of their 12-month follow-up.  Outcome measures:   We assessed aspects of feasibility including eligibility, recruitment, data collection, attrition, feasibility of the methodology, acceptability of the intervention and potential to calculate cost-effectiveness.  Results:   The recruitment rate of eligible patients was 44%; 68 participants consented and 58 (85%) completed baseline measures. Randomisation procedures were acceptable, data collection methods (including cost-effectiveness data) were feasible and the intervention was acceptable to participants. Retention rates at 6-month and 12-month follow-up were 72% and 69%, respectively. At 6-month follow-up, 30% of the usual care group had returned to full-time or part-time work (including phased return to work) compared with 43% of the intervention group. At 12 months, the percentages were 47% (usual care) and 68% (intervention).

Because healthcare system mistrust has contributed to these disparities for centuries, black men may be less inclined to pursue novel testing, and identification of facilitators to their participation in prostate cancer research studies remains warranted.  Methods:   A community-engaged approach involving a partnership with a community organization was used to conduct seven focus groups in Minnesota, Alabama, and California to explore black men's attitudes toward prostate cancer research participation and genomic testing for prostate cancer. Data were collected and analyzed from April 2015 to April 2017.  Results:   Identified genomic testing barriers included a lack of terminology understanding, healthcare system mistrust, reluctance to seek medical care, and unfavorable attitudes toward research. Facilitators included family history, value of prevention, and the desire for health education. Lack of prostate cancer knowledge, prostate-specific antigen testing confusion, healthcare system distrust, and misuse of personal health information were barriers to research study participation. Some black men were motivated to participate in research if it was seen as constructive and transparent.  Conclusions:   Disparities for black men can both motivate and disincentivize participation depending upon a positive or negative view of research. Confusion over prostate cancer clinical care has fueled some mistrust among black men affecting both clinical care and research participation. With increased education, health literacy, and assurances of research integrity and transparency, black men may be more willing to participate in prostate cancer testing and research.

Apoptosis assay confirmed a programmed cell death ruling out necrosis. Most importantly enhanced cellular uptake was obtained for FITC#FA@MSNs. In addition, pharmacokinetic and biodistribution studies in healthy mice indicated a favourable longer circulation time and reduced plasma elimination rate for ETE/FA@MSNs than free ETE.

In order to improve the specificity and exclude a false positive diagnosis in PSA test, PCa-specific glycosylation subtypes of PSA were explored using in-depth quantitative profiling of PSA glycoforms based on mass spectrometric oxonium ion monitoring technology. As a result of analysis using sera from 15 PCa or 15 benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH) patients whose PSA levels were in the ""gray zone"" (4.0-10.0 ng/mL), 52 glycan structures on PSA were quantitatively observed. We found that abundance of multisialylated LacdiNAc (GalNAcβ1-4GlcNAc) structures were significantly upregulated in the PCa group compared to the BPH group. A couple of those glycoforms were then extracted and subjected to establish a novel PCa-specific diagnosis model (PSA G-index). When the diagnostic power was assessed using an independent validation sample set (15 PCa and 15 BPH patients in the PSA gray zone), an AUC of PSA G-index was 1.00, while that of total PSA or PSA f/T ratio was 0.50 or 0.60, respectively. Moreover, both PSA glycoforms showed significant correlation with Gleason scores. Lectin histochemical staining analysis also showed that PCa cells overexpressed glycoproteins containing LacdiNAc and sialic acids moieties. Thus, PSA G-index could serve as not only an effective secondary screening method to exclude false positive diagnosis in PSA screening, but also a potential grading biomarker for PCa.""","""['Yoshimi Haga', 'Motohide Uemura', 'Satoko Baba', 'Kentaro Inamura', 'Kengo Takeuchi', 'Norio Nonomura', 'Koji Ueda']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Anal Chem""","""['Improvement of Prostate Cancer Diagnosis by Detecting PSA Glycosylation-Specific Changes.', 'LacdiNAc-Glycosylated Prostate-specific Antigen\xa0Density is a Potential Biomarker of Prostate\xa0Cancer.', 'Wisteria floribunda Agglutinin and Its Reactive-Glycan-Carrying Prostate-Specific Antigen as a Novel Diagnostic and Prognostic Marker of Prostate Cancer.', 'The role of biomarkers in the assessment of prostate cancer risk prior to prostate biopsy: which markers matter and how should they be used?', 'Do prostate cancer risk models improve the predictive accuracy of PSA screening?

Seven patients were arbitrarily selected from among localized prostate cancer patients on whom CIRT was performed in our facilities in 2010. All subjects received the same dose of CIRT, namely, 57.6 Gy relative biological effectiveness (RBE) in 16 fractions. The following two types of images were acquired for each subject: planning computed tomography (CT) images overlaying the dose distribution of CIRT and MRI T2-weighted images (T2WI) taken 1 year after CIRT. The fusion image of the planning CT and MRI images was registered by using a treatment-planning system, and the CIRT dose distribution was compared with changes observed in the MRI of the obturator internus muscles located near the prostate. The signal changes in the axial image passing through the isocenter of the planning target volume were digitized, and a scatter diagram was created showing the relationship between the radiation dose and digitized signal changes. A strong correlation between the radiation dose and the MRI signal intensity changes was observed, and a quadratic function was found to have the best fit.

These findings are supported by public RNA-seq data showing that reduced HOXA10 expression is correlated with poor patient survival. We show that HOXA10 suppresses PCa cell proliferation, anchorage colony formation and xenograft growth independent to androgens. Using AmpliSeq transcriptome sequencing, we have found that gene groups associated with lipid metabolism and androgen receptor (AR) signaling are enriched in the HOXA10 transcriptome. Furthermore, we demonstrate that HOXA10 suppresses the transcription of the fatty acid synthase (FASN) gene by forming a protein complex with AR and prevents AR recruitment to the FASN gene promoter.

Materials and Methods In this prospective study, consecutive male study participants underwent preoperative 3.0-T MRI from June 2007 to March 2017 followed by robotic-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy. An MRI-based EPE grading system was defined as follows: curvilinear contact length of 1.5 cm or capsular bulge and irregularity were grade 1, both features were grade 2, and frank capsular breach were grade 3. Multivariable logistic regression and decision curve analyses were performed to compare the MRI grade model and clinical parameters (prostate-specific antigen, Gleason score) for pathologic EPE prediction by using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) value. Results Among 553 study participants, the mean age was 60 years ± 8 (standard deviation); the median prostate-specific antigen value was 6.3 ng/mL. A total of 125 of 553 (22%) participants had pathologic EPE at radical prostatectomy. Detection of pathologic EPE, defined as number of pathologic EPEs divided by number of participants with individual MRI features, was as follows: curvilinear contact length, 88 of 208 (42%); capsular bulge and irregularity, 78 of 175 (45%); and EPE visible at MRI, 37 of 56 (66%). For MRI, grades 1, 2, and 3 for detection of pathologic EPE were 18 of 74 (24%), 39 of 102 (38%), and 37 of 56 (66%), respectively. Clinical features plus the MRI-based EPE grading system (prostate-specific antigen, International Society of Urological Pathology stage, MRI grade) predicted pathologic EPE better than did MRI grade alone (AUC, 0.81 vs 0.77, respectively; P < .001). Conclusion Higher MRI-based extraprostatic extension (EPE) grading categories were associated with a greater risk of pathologic EPE. Clinical features plus MRI grading had the highest diagnostic performance for prediction of pathologic EPE. © RSNA, 2019 Online supplemental material is available for this article.

BRG1 has been identified as a tumor suppressor in some cancer types but has been shown to be expressed at elevated levels, relative to normal tissue, in other cancers. Using TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas) prostate cancer database, we determined that BRG1 mRNA and protein expression is elevated in prostate tumors relative to normal prostate tissue. Only 3 of 491 (0.6%) sequenced tumors showed amplification of the locus or mutation in the protein coding sequence, arguing against the idea that elevated expression due to amplification or expression of a mutant BRG1 protein is associated with prostate cancer. Kaplan-Meier survival curves showed that BRG1 expression in prostate tumors inversely correlated with survival. However, BRG1 expression did not correlate with Gleason score/International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) Grade Group, indicating it is an independent predictor of tumor progression/patient outcome. To experimentally assess BRG1 as a possible therapeutic target, we treated prostate cancer cells with a biologic inhibitor called ADAADi (active DNA-dependent ATPase A Domain inhibitor) that targets the activity of the SNF2 family of ATPases in biochemical assays but showed specificity for BRG1 in prior tissue culture experiments. The inhibitor decreased prostate cancer cell proliferation and induced apoptosis. When directly injected into xenografts established by injection of prostate cancer cells in mouse flanks, the inhibitor decreased tumor growth and increased survival. These results indicate the efficacy of pursuing BRG1 as both an indicator of patient outcome and as a therapeutic target.""","""['Rohini Muthuswami', 'LeeAnn Bailey', 'Radhakrishnan Rakesh', 'Anthony N Imbalzano', 'Jeffrey A Nickerson', 'Joel W Hockensmith']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""J Cell Physiol""","""['Discovery of Orally Active Inhibitors of Brahma Homolog (BRM)/SMARCA2 ATPase Activity for the Treatment of Brahma Related Gene 1 (BRG1)/SMARCA4-Mutant Cancers.', 'SWI/SNF chromatin-remodeling enzymes Brahma-related gene 1 (BRG1) and Brahma (BRM) are dispensable in multiple models of postnatal angiogenesis but are required for vascular integrity in infant mice.', 'The BRG1 ATPase of human SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling enzymes as a driver of cancer.', 'Loss of the INI1 tumor suppressor does not impair the expression of multiple BRG1-dependent genes or the assembly of SWI/SNF enzymes.', 'Involvement of the chromatin-remodeling factor BRG1/SMARCA4 in human cancer.', 'The SMARCA4R1157W mutation facilitates chromatin remodeling and confers PRMT1/SMARCA4 inhibitors sensitivity in colorectal cancer.', 'BRG1 HSA domain interactions with BCL7 proteins are critical for remodeling and gene expression.', ""BRG1: Promoter or Suppressor of Cancer?

In this retrospective analysis, we assessed whether initiating docetaxel treatment in close proximity to the start of ADT therapy for metastatic castrate-sensitive prostate cancer (mCSPC) is associated with more treatment-related toxicity. We identified all patients with mCSPC treated at The Ottawa Hospital that received docetaxel chemotherapy between June 2014 and September 2017. For each patient, we calculated the time to chemotherapy (TTC) interval between the start of ADT and the first cycle of docetaxel. We checked for an association between TTC and febrile neutropenia (FN), toxicity-induced dose reduction, toxicity-induced treatment delay, and toxicity-induced treatment discontinuation. Eighty-three patients were identified. The median TTC was 67 days (range 3-189). Twenty-three patients (27.7%) experienced FN. Docetaxel toxicity resulted in 8 patients (9.6%) having their treatment delayed, 30 patients (36.1%) having their dose reduced and 18 (21.6%) having their treatment discontinued before completing the scheduled 6 cycles. No correlation was found between the TTC and FN (P = 0.99), docetaxel dose reduction (P = 0.95), treatment delay (P = 0.06), and treatment discontinuation (P = 0.88).

Methods:   This retrospective study compared 52 patients with radiation-recurrent PCa after EBRT or BT treated with S-HIFU (n = 27) or S-RP (n = 25) between 1998 and 2016. We estimated overall survival (OS), cancer-specific survival (CSS), and metastasis-free survival (MFS) at 5 years. Incontinence after local salvage therapy (LST) was scored according to the number of pads used per day. Complications were graded according to the Clavien-Dindo classification.  Results:   Both groups were similar for pre-LST tumor features, however, no S-HIFU patients received BT and S-RP patients were younger and healthier. Median follow-up was 45 months for S-HIFU and 43 months for S-RP. No significant differences were found in estimated 5-year OS (80.9% vs. 61.9%, p = 0.24), 5-year CSS (84.0% vs. 74.0%, p = 0.36), and 5-year MFS (60.3% vs. 55.2%, p = 0.55) for S-HIFU vs. S-RP, respectively. We observed a significant difference in pad-dependent status at 12 months (22.2% vs. 56.0%, p = 0.01) and in the number of Clavien ≥ III complications [9 (7/27 patients) vs. 16 (12/25 patients), p = 0.027] in favor of S-HIFU vs. S-RP, respectively.  Conclusion:   S-HIFU and S-RP could both be considered valuable LST options for patients with radiation-recurrent nonmetastatic PCa with sufficient life expectancy.

Patients and methods:   We synthesized monodisperse gold nanoparticles as SERS-enhanced substrates and analyzed preoperative plasma samples of patients who underwent RP. The roles of clinical risk model (Cancer of the Prostate Risk Assessment [CAPRA] score) and distinctive SERS spectra on prediction of early biochemical recurrence were evaluated. The principal component analysis and linear discriminant analysis (PCA-LDA) were used to manage the spectral data and develop diagnostic algorithm.  Results:   A total of 306 preoperative plasma Raman spectra from 102 patients were collected. SERS spectrum from those who developed early biochemical recurrence were compared to those who remained biochemical recurrence-free. The SERS detected more abundant circulating free nucleic acid bases in biochemical recurrence population, presenting significant stronger intensities at SERS spectral bands 725 and 1,328 cm-1. The addition of Raman spectral peak 1,328 cm-1 to CAPRA postsurgical (CAPRA-S) score significantly improved the predictive power of logistic regression model compared to simple CAPRA score (P<0.001). Meanwhile, the leave-one-out cross-validation method was used to validate the PCA-LDA model and revealed the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of 65.8%, 87.5%, and 79.4%, respectively. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to evaluate the performance of different models. Area under the ROC curve of the CAPRA-S score model alone was 0.77, however, when combined with Raman spectral peak 1,328 cm-1, it improved to 0.81.

We conducted a randomized phase 1 trial combining pembrolizumab with either sequential (A) or concomitant (B) stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) in metastatic urothelial carcinoma (mUC). No dose-limiting toxicity occurred. Treatment-related adverse events (trAEs; Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v4.0) of grade 1-2 occurred in six of nine and all nine patients in arms A and B, respectively. One grade 3 trAE occurred in arm B. No grade 4-5 trAEs occurred. Overall response rates of 0% and 44.4% were noted in arms A and B, respectively, as per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors v1.1. The trial was not powered to compare efficacy between arms. Targeted sequencing of tissue DNA and circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) revealed high genomic concordance. Treatment response was associated with ctDNA fraction decline. We conclude that sequential and concomitant SBRT can be safely combined with pembrolizumab in mUC and that the effect of SBRT timing on efficacy is worth exploring further.

Human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) acts as a tumor-specific promoter, triggering certain genes to replicate or express only in tumor cells, conferring specific replication and killing abilities. This study aimed to investigate the anticancer potential of the recombinant adenovirus Ad-apoptin-hTERTp-E1a (Ad-VT) in prostate cancer.  Methods:   The pGL4.51 plasmid was used to transfect PC-3 cells to construct tumor cells stably expressing luciferase (PC-3-luc). Crystal violet staining and MTS assays determined the ability of Ad-VT to inhibit cell proliferation. Ad-VT-induced apoptosis of PC-3-luc cells was detected using Hoechst, Annexin V, JC-1 staining, and caspases activity analysis. PC-3-luc cells invasion and migration were detected using cell-scratch and Transwell assays. In vivo tumor inhibition was detected using imaging techniques.  Results:   Crystal violet staining and MTS results showed that the proliferation ability of PC-3-luc cells decreased significantly. Hoechst, JC-1, and Annexin V experiments demonstrated that Ad-VT mainly induced apoptosis to inhibit PC-3-luc cell proliferation. Ad-VT could significantly inhibit the migration and invasion of PC-3-luc cells over a short period of time. In vivo, Ad-VT could effectively inhibit tumor growth and prolong survival of the mice.

However, data on the importance of sexuality and possible consequences of altered erectile functioning on self-esteem in men with localized PCa are lacking.  Methods:   Self-report questionnaires were completed by 292 men with PCa, initially managed with active surveillance (AS) or radical prostatectomy (RP). Independent t-tests were conducted to evaluate group differences. A sequential multiple regression model was fitted to analyze the associations between the importance of sexuality, changes in erectile functioning and impairment of self-esteem. Interaction effects were tested using simple slope analyses.  Results:   Participants were 70 ± 7.2 years old and 66.5% rated sex as being ""rather/very important"". The two groups differed markedly in changes in erectile functioning, importance of sexuality and impairment of self-esteem (p < .001), with higher values in RP patients. Regression analysis showed that after adjustment for control variables and importance of sexuality, changes in erectile functioning were still associated with impairment of self-esteem (B = .668, SE = .069, p < .001). The interaction of changes in erectile functioning and importance of sexuality reached significance (B = .318, SE = .062, p < .001).  Conclusions:   RP patients report more changes in erectile functioning than AS patients. Moreover, in men with localized PCa, erectile functioning and self-esteem are closely related.

Using genome-wide association study summary statistics across six cancer types based on a total of 296,215 cases and 301,319 controls of European ancestry, here we estimate the pair-wise genetic correlations between breast, colorectal, head/neck, lung, ovary and prostate cancer, and between cancers and 38 other diseases. We observed statistically significant genetic correlations between lung and head/neck cancer (rg = 0.57, p = 4.6 × 10-8), breast and ovarian cancer (rg = 0.24, p = 7 × 10-5), breast and lung cancer (rg = 0.18, p =1.5 × 10-6) and breast and colorectal cancer (rg = 0.15, p = 1.1 × 10-4). We also found that multiple cancers are genetically correlated with non-cancer traits including smoking, psychiatric diseases and metabolic characteristics. Functional enrichment analysis revealed a significant excess contribution of conserved and regulatory regions to cancer heritability. Our comprehensive analysis of cross-cancer heritability suggests that solid tumors arising across tissues share in part a common germline genetic basis.""","""['Xia Jiang', 'Hilary K Finucane',

This retrospective study evaluates clinical outcomes of 177Lu-PRLT in earlier and later phases of mCRPC grouped by previous taxane chemotherapy. Methods: A retrospective analysis was performed on 167 patients with mCRPC who underwent 177Lu-PRLT between March 2013 and December 2016. Patients were classified as either taxane chemotherapy pretreated (T-pretreated) or naïve (T-naïve) depending on whether they had received taxane-based chemotherapy prior to 177Lu-PRLT. Clinical outcome for T-pretreated and T-naïve patients was assessed by overall survival (OS), radiographic progression-free survival, and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response rate. Univariate and multivariable analyses were performed for both T-pretreated and T-naïve patients to determine predictors of outcome. Toxicity was categorized by the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (version 4.03). Results: Of the 167 patients treated with 177Lu-PRLT, 83 were T-pretreated and 84 were T-naïve. At baseline, T-pretreated patients had overall poorer performance status, a higher prevalence of bone metastases, higher PSA levels, lower hemoglobin levels, higher alkaline phosphatase (ALP) levels and had received more additional therapies compared with T-naïve patients. Median OS was 10.7 mo for T-pretreated patients and 27.1 mo for T-naïve patients. Median radiographic progression-free survival was 6.0 mo for T-pretreated patients and 8.8 mo for T-naïve patients. PSA response assessment was evaluable in 132 patients and seen in 25 of 62 (40%) T-pretreated patients and 40 of 70 (57%) T-naïve patients. Significant determinates of inferior OS in multivariable analysis for T-pretreated patients were poorer performance status, lower cumulative administered activity, and lower baseline hemoglobin. Higher baseline alkaline phosphatase was the only significant determinate of inferior OS in multivariable analysis for T-naïve patients. Overall 177Lu-PRLT was safe, with minimal adverse effects evident during follow-up in both T-pretreated and T-naïve patients. Conclusion: 177Lu-PRLT is a promising therapy in mCRPC, with encouraging outcomes and minimal associated toxicity seen in both our T-naïve and heavily pretreated patient cohorts.""","""['Thomas W Barber', 'Aviral Singh', 'Harshad R Kulkarni', 'Karin Niepsch', 'Baki Billah', 'Richard P Baum']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""J Nucl Med""","""['A Self-Fulfilling Prophecy: Comparing 177Lu-PSMA Radioligand Therapy in Taxane-Naïve Versus Posttaxane Metastasized Prostate Cancer Patients?', 'Therapeutic efficacy, prognostic variables and clinical outcome of 177Lu-PSMA-617 PRLT in progressive mCRPC following multiple lines of treatment: prognostic implications of high FDG uptake on dual tracer PET-CT vis-à-vis Gleason score in such cohort.', '177Lu-PSMA-617 Radioligand Therapy in Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer Patients with a Single Functioning Kidney.', 'Treatment Outcome, Toxicity, and Predictive Factors for Radioligand Therapy with 177Lu-PSMA-I&T in Metastatic Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer.', '177Lu-PSMA therapy : Current evidence for use in the treatment of patients with metastatic prostate cancer.', 'Therapeutic Responses and Survival Effects of 177Lu-PSMA-617 Radioligand Therapy in Metastatic Castrate-Resistant Prostate Cancer: A Meta-analysis.', 'Novel radionuclide therapy combinations in prostate cancer.', 'Determinants of outcome following PSMA-based radioligand therapy and mechanisms of resistance in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Joint EANM/SNMMI procedure guideline for the use of 177Lu-labeled PSMA-targeted radioligand-therapy (177Lu-PSMA-RLT).', 'Treatment of Advanced Metastatic Prostate Cancer Using Molecular-Targeted Therapy: Radioligand Lutetium-177 Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen.', 'Case Report: Long-term complete response to PSMA-targeted radioligand therapy and abiraterone in a metastatic prostate cancer patient.']"""

PET/CT with choline derivatives used to be the standard tool for imaging metastases, whereas 68Ga-PSMA (prostate-specific membrane antigen) PET/CT was introduced recently. Both PET techniques were investigated with respect to what extent the detection rate of LNM depends on the size of tumor deposits (TDs) within LNM. Methods: Documenting the switch from the use of 18F-choline to 68Ga-PSMA in 2014, we used 2 patient cohorts undergoing a template lymphadenectomy because of a PET/CT indicating LNM. Forty-four and 40 patients underwent PET/CT with 18F-choline or 68Ga-PSMA ligand, respectively. In total, 226 LNM (125 18F-choline, 101 68Ga-PSMA) originated from 73 salvage lymphadenectomies at biochemical recurrence and from 11 primary lymphadenectomies at radical prostatectomy. LNM eligible for direct correlation of PET/CT to histopathology were identified from lymphadenectomies conducted in small anatomic subregions, with 1 LNM (condition 1) or 1-2 LNM (condition 2). Longitudinal and short diameters of TD within LNM were determined by histopathology, allowing linking of the size of TD in LNM to the detection threshold of PET/CT. Diameters associated with a detection rate of 50% and 90% (d50%, d90%) were calculated on the basis of logistic growth curve models fitted. Results: Gleason score, number of removed LNs, and subregions for lymphadenectomy per patient did not differ significantly between the 18F-choline and 68Ga-PSMA groups. The median prostate-specific antigen level at imaging and number of LNM per patient were significantly higher in the 18F-choline group (3.4 ng/mL, n = 34) than in the 68Ga-PSMA group (2.2 ng/mL, n = 28; both P < 0.05). Longitudinal and short diameters of TD in LNM to reach d90% were 11.2 and 7.4 mm, respectively, for 18F-choline PET/CT and 6.3 and 4.9 mm, respectively, for 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT. Corresponding diameters to reach d50% were 5.5 and 3.3 mm, respectively, for 18F-choline PET/CT and 3.7 and 2.3 mm, respectively, for 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT. Detection rates were significantly higher under 68Ga-PSMA (P = 0.005 and 0.04 for longitudinal and short diameter). Conclusion: 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT is superior to 18F-choline PET/CT in the detection of LNM. Whether those results will lead to an improved patient outcome after 68Ga-PSMA PET-guided therapy needs to be investigated by further studies.""","""['Cordula A Jilg', 'Vanessa Drendel', 'H Christian Rischke', 'Teresa I Beck', 'Kathrin Reichel', 'Malte Krönig', 'Ulrich Wetterauer', 'Wolfgang Schultze-Seemann', 'Philipp T Meyer', 'Werner Vach']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""J Nucl Med""","""['Value of 68Ga-PSMA HBED-CC PET for the Assessment of Lymph Node Metastases in Prostate Cancer Patients with Biochemical Recurrence: Comparison with Histopathology After Salvage Lymphadenectomy.', 'Diagnostic Accuracy of Ga-68-HBED-CC-PSMA-Ligand-PET/CT before Salvage Lymph Node Dissection for Recurrent Prostate Cancer.', 'Histological comparison between predictive value of preoperative 3-T multiparametric MRI and 68 Ga-PSMA PET/CT scan for pathological outcomes at radical prostatectomy and pelvic lymph node dissection for prostate cancer.', 'Use of gallium-68 prostate-specific membrane antigen positron-emission tomography for detecting lymph node metastases in primary and recurrent prostate cancer and location of recurrence after radical prostatectomy: an overview of the current literature.', 'Prostate-specific membrane antigen positron emission tomography in the management of recurrent prostate cancer.', 'Up-to-Date Imaging and Diagnostic Techniques for Prostate Cancer: A Literature Review.', 'Molecular Imaging in Primary Staging of Prostate Cancer Patients: Current Aspects and Future Trends.', 'Salvage therapy for prostate cancer after radical prostatectomy.', 'Predicting the Risk of Metastases by PSMA-PET/CT-Evaluation of 335 Men with Treatment-Naïve Prostate Carcinoma.', 'The ProPSMA Randomized Trial: A Landmark Study with Many Lessons.']"""

It was our aim to investigate if the new tracer targeting the prostate-specific membrane antigen (68Ga-PSMA-11) could be used to localize recurrent disease with PET/MR in patients with discrepant findings between mpMRI and template biopsies. Methods: Interim analysis was performed of the first 10 patients scanned between September 2016 and May 2018 with positive template biopsy and negative mpMRI after HIFU from an ongoing clinical trial (NCT02265159). All patients underwent 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/MRI within 3 mo. Four prostatic quadrants were defined, and for every quadrant suspicion for recurrence was rated on a 5-point Likert scale from definitely no recurrence (1) to highly suspected of recurrence (5), with 4 used as a cutoff for suspected disease based on PET/MRI by a masked reader. 68Ga-PSMA-11 uptake of suspected lesions and background areas was measured with the SUVmax The apparent diffusion coefficient values of lesions and background were given for each segment. PET/MRI scans were compared with the template biopsy results, including corresponding Gleason scores (GS), number of positive cores, and tumor length. Results: The quadrant-based sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values for PET/MRI were 55%, 100%, 100%, and 85%, respectively. Patient-based PET/MRI was negative in 4 cases with GS 3 + 4 and a tumor length between 0.1 and 3 mm. All tumor lesions with GS 4 + 3 or higher were detected on PET/MRI.

Study 2: 15 primary high-risk PCa patients and 12 controls without known prostate disease were included in a clinical drug trial (EudraCT 2016-003185-26). 68Ga-prostate-specific membrane antigen PET/CT scans of PCa patients were available. Pelvic 82Rb PET was performed. Results: Study 1: both 82Rb K1 and 82Rb SUVs correlated strongly with 15O-H2O TBF (ρ = 0.95, P < 0.001, and ρ = 0.77, P = 0.015, respectively). 82Rb SUV and K1 were linearly correlated (r = 0.92, P = 0.001). 82Rb SUV correlated with postprostatectomy GGG (ρ = 0.70, P = 0.03). Study 2: 82Rb SUV in PCa (3.19 ± 0.48) was significantly higher than prostate 82Rb SUV in healthy controls (1.68 ± 0.37) (P < 0.001), with no overlap between groups. Conclusion: Study 1 shows that 82Rb PET/CT can be used for TBF quantification and that TBF can be estimated by simple SUV and suggests that 82Rb SUV is associated with postprostatectomy GGG and, hence, cancer aggressiveness. Study 2 shows that 82Rb uptake is significantly higher in PCa than in normal prostate tissue with no overlap between cohorts, confirming the primary hypothesis of the clinical trial. Consequently, 82Rb PET/CT may have potential as a noninvasive tool for evaluation of tumor aggressiveness and monitoring in nonmetastatic PCa.""","""['Mads R Jochumsen', 'Lars P Tolbod', 'Bodil G Pedersen', 'Maria M Nielsen', 'Søren Høyer', 'Jørgen Frøkiær', 'Michael Borre', 'Kirsten Bouchelouche', 'Jens Sörensen']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""J Nucl Med""","""['More advantages in detecting bone and soft tissue metastases from prostate cancer using 18F-PSMA PET/CT.', 'Tumour blood flow for prediction of human prostate cancer aggressiveness: a study with Rubidium-82 PET, MRI and Na+/K+-ATPase-density.', 'PSMA uptake on 68Ga-PSMA-11-PET/CT positively correlates with prostate cancer aggressiveness.', 'Multiparametric MRI in detection and staging of prostate cancer.', 'New Clinical Indications for (18)F/(11)C-choline, New Tracers for Positron Emission Tomography and a Promising Hybrid Device for Prostate Cancer Staging: A Systematic Review of the Literature.', 'Primary breast cancer diagnosed by 82-Rubidium myocardial perfusion PET-scan.', 'Extracardiac findings with increased perfusion during clinical O-15-H2O PET/CT myocardial perfusion imaging: A case series.', '68Ga-DOTATATE Prepared from Cyclotron-Produced 68Ga: An Integrated Solution from Cyclotron Vault to Safety Assessment and Diagnostic Efficacy in Neuroendocrine Cancer Patients.', 'Rubidium Uptake in Chest Tumors on PET/CT.', 'Potential synergy between PSMA uptake and tumour blood flow for prediction of human prostate cancer aggressiveness.']"""

The ability of CLE to describe prostatic and periprostatic tissues, and prostate cancer (PCa) is still an object of investigation.  Objective:   To create an atlas of ex vivo CLE images of prostatic and periprostatic tissues, and PCa in order to recognise different prostatic structures.  Design, setting, and participants:   From November 2017 to February 2018, 15 patients underwent radical prostatectomy for biopsy-proven PCa.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Based on preoperative data and macroscopic examination, tumour location was assessed and confirmed on frozen sections. Prior to ex vivo CLE analysis, prostates were stained with fluorescein 10%. We used a GastroFlex probe to collect images of periprostatic tissue (adipose tissue, fibrous and connective tissues, vessels, nerve sheets, seminal vesicles, and urethra). Normal prostatic glands and tumour tissue according to the Gleason grade were analysed. Each PCa Gleason score was represented.  Results and limitations:   A total of 139 video clips and 237 pictures of prostatic and periprostatic tissues were collected. Among them, we selected 16 highly representative images. Adipose tissue, fibrous tissue, and connective tissue were supposable in all 15 specimens. PCa glands captured fluorescein in their cytoplasm, normal prostatic glands did not capture fluorescein, and glandular structures were easily recognisable. The principal limitation of this study is its ex vivo nature of the study.  Conclusions:   Each CLE image was correlated with the corresponding haematoxylin/eosin/saffron definitive pathology image, allowing building of an atlas as a necessary tool to assess the diagnostic performance of CLE during radical prostatectomy in achieving negative surgical margins.

We sought to determine factors associated with SRT utilization as well as variation in its administration.  Materials and methods:   Patients with localized prostate cancer undergoing RP at 33 practices participating in the statewide Michigan Urological Surgery Improvement Collaborative between 2012 and 2016 were prospectively followed. Eligible patients had at least 1 post-RP PSA level ≥0.1 ng/mL with ≥6 months of follow-up after the first detectable PSA level. Patients undergoing adjuvant radiation therapy were excluded. SRT utilization and clinical and pathologic patient characteristics were examined.  Results:   Of 1010 eligible patients with a detectable PSA level, 29.5% underwent SRT. Of patients who received SRT, 46.9% either reached a PSA ≥0.2 ng/mL or were treated before reaching that PSA level. A total of 30.6% of patients had a PSA level ≥0.5 ng/mL without undergoing prior SRT; of this group, 42.1% later received SRT. After adjusting for patient and practice level factors, positive surgical margins, higher T stage, and higher grade group were all associated with receipt of SRT (P < .05). Even after adjusting for patient and tumor characteristics, significant variation remained in the adjusted rate of SRT utilization across practices sites, ranging from 7% (95% confidence interval, 3%-17%) to 73% (95% confidence interval, 45%-90%, P < .001). Practices were grouped into tertiles based on SRT utilization, and those practices that used SRT more frequently overall were more likely to administer SRT across all patient-based predictors of SRT utilization.  Conclusions:   SRT utilization is low among men with a detectable post-RP PSA level, with significant variation in practice-level SRT utilization that cannot be explained by patient factors alone. Factors suggesting higher-risk disease were predictors of SRT administration. These data support the potential to expand the use of SRT, particularly among sites with low utilization.""","""['Scott R Hawken', 'Daniel E Spratt', 'Ji Qi', 'Susan M Linsell', 'Michael L Cher', 'Khurshid R Ghani', 'David C Miller', 'James E Montie', 'Todd M Morgan;Michigan Urological Surgery Improvement Collaborative']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys""","""['Partial Prostate Cancer Treatment for Aggressive Disease-Common Practice.', 'Variation in the use of postoperative radiotherapy among high-risk patients following radical prostatectomy.', 'Defining biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy and timing of early salvage radiotherapy : Informing the debate.', 'Improved biochemical outcome with adjuvant radiotherapy after radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer with poor pathologic features.', 'The timing of salvage radiotherapy after radical prostatectomy: a systematic review.', 'Use of androgen deprivation and salvage radiation therapy for patients with prostate cancer and biochemical recurrence after prostatectomy.', 'Time management: Improving the timing of post-prostatectomy radiotherapy, clinical trials, and knowledge translation.', 'Salvage therapy for prostate cancer after radical prostatectomy.', 'National trends in the management of patients with positive surgical margins at radical prostatectomy.']"""

Since radiation therapy (RT) can suppress bone marrow function and immune responses, previous studies evaluating sipuleucel-T excluded patients who received RT less than or equal to 28 days prior to sipuleucel-T therapy. Recent evidence suggests that RT may act synergistically with immunotherapy to enhance and broaden antitumor immune response.  Methods:   Patients who met standard criteria for sipuleucel-T were randomized to receive sipuleucel-T alone (Arm A) or sipuleucel-T initiated 1 week after completing sensitizing RT to single metastatic site (Arm B). RT was delivered at 300cGy/day to 3000 cGy total. The primary endpoint was the ability to safely combine sipuleucel-T preceded by RT and generate sipuleucel-T with adequate product immune activation parameters. Secondary endpoints included the measurement of systemic immune responses to prostatic acid phosphatase (PAP), a target for sipuleucel-T immune therapy and PA20204 (recombinant fusion protein utilized in the generation of sipuleucel-T).  Results:   51 pts were enrolled, 2 did not receive any sipuleucel-T because of vascular access problems and were excluded. 24 were treated on Arm A, 25 on Arm B. 47/49 patients received all 3 sipuleucel-T infusions. Median age was 66 yrs (range 45-90). Sipuleucel-T product parameters including: total nucleated cell (TNC) count, antigen presenting cell (APC) count were similar in both groups. Cumulative APC upregulation was higher in Arm A. 1 patient in Arm A demonstrated PSA response. Median progression free survival (PFS) was 2.46 months on Arm A and 3.65 months on Arm B (p = 0.06). Both arms showed similar increases in humoral responses to PA2024 and PAP. IFN-ƴ ELISPOT T-cell activation responses to PA20204 were observed in both arms, but were more robust in the Arm A (p = 0.028). Both arms were well-tolerated, with fatigue as the most common grade 2 adverse event (1 patient in Arm A and 3 patients in Arm B).  Conclusions:   Sensitizing RT completed 1 week before generation of sipuleucel-T did not affect the majority of product parameters and the ability to deliver sipuleucel-T therapy.

Data on patient characteristics, therapy, clinical outcome and microbiological results were obtained from the electronic medical records. The relative impact of antibiotic therapy, patient factors and pathogens on clinical outcome was assessed with univariate logistic regression using a 95% confidence interval (CI).  Results:   832 prescriptions were identified, and 171 patients treated with nitrofurantoin (n = 69), pivmecillinam (n = 57) and trimethoprim (n = 45) met the inclusion criteria. Treatment failure occurred in one patient treated with nitrofurantoin and in four patients treated with pivmecillinam. New prescriptions of UTI antibiotics and relapse within 3 months after completion of therapy were more frequent with nitrofurantoin (34% and 15%) and pivmecillinam (30% and 17%) than trimethoprim (22 and 7%). However, these differences were not statistically significant and substantial heterogeneity was noted between the treatment groups. Urinary tract catheterization was associated with a higher risk for new antibiotic prescriptions (OR 2.34, 95% CI 1.14-4.80; P = 0.022) and prostate cancer was associated with a higher incidence of relapse (OR 3.01, 95% CI 1.09-8.29; P = 0.042).

However, the specific features of cases diagnosed at younger ages (<65 years) suggest that they may represent a different clinical subtype. Our aim was to assess this suggestion by contrasting the geographical PC mortality and hospital admissions patterns in Spain for all ages to those in younger men.  Methods:   The Spanish National Institute of Statistics supplied data on PC mortality, hospital admission, and population data. We estimated the expected town-specific number of deaths and calculated the standardized mortality ratios. Spatial autoregressive models of Besag-York-Mollié provided smoother municipal estimators of PC mortality risk (all ages; <65 years). We computed the provincial age-standardized rate ratios of PC hospital admissions (all men; <60 years) using Spanish rates as the reference.  Results:   A total of 29,566 PC deaths (6% among those <65 years) were registered between 2010-2014, with three high-mortality risk zones: Northwest Spain; Southwest Andalusia & Granada; and a broad band extending from the Pyrenees Mountains to the north of Valencia. In younger men, the spatial patterns shared the high risk of mortality in the Northwest but not the central band. The PC hospital discharge rates confirmed a North-South gradient but also low mortality/high admission rates in Madrid and Barcelona and the opposite in Southwest Andalusia.  Conclusion:   The consistent high PC mortality/morbidity risk in the Northwest of Spain indicates an area with a real excess of risk. The different spatial pattern in younger men suggests that some factors associated with geographical risk might have differential effects by age.

The possibility of escalating the dose to the involved seminal vesicles (ISV) while respecting the dose constraints in the organs at risk is thus so far not clearly demonstrated. The objective of the study was to analyze the dose distribution and the clinical outcome in a large series of patients who received IMRT for T3b prostate cancer.  Materials and methods:   This retrospective analysis included all patients who received IMRT and androgen deprivation therapy for T3b prostate cancer, between 2008 and 2017, in six French institutions, with available MRI images and dosimetric data.  Results:   A total of 276 T3b patients were included. The median follow-up was 26 months. The median (range) prescribed doses (Gy) to the prostate and to the ISV were 77 (70-80) and 76 (46-80), respectively. The dose constraint recommendations were exceeded in less than 12% of patients for the rectum and the bladder. The 5-year risks of biochemical and clinical recurrences and cancer-specific death were 24.8%, 21.7%, and 10.3%, respectively. The 5-year risks of local, pelvic lymph node, and metastatic recurrences were 6.4%, 11.3%, and 15%, respectively. The number of involved lymph nodes (≤ 2 or ≥ 3) on MRI was the only significant prognostic factor in clinical recurrence (HR 9.86) and death (HR 2.78). Grade ≥ 2 acute and 5-year late toxicity rates were 13.2% and 12% for digestive toxicity, and 34% and 31.5% for urinary toxicity, respectively. The dose to the pelvic lymph node and the age were predictive of late digestive toxicity.

The prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) is highly over-expressed in prostatic cancer cells in a manner that correlates with both tumour stage and clinical outcome. As such, PSMA has been identified as an attractive target for both imaging and treatment of prostate cancer. In recent years the focus on urea-based peptidomimetic inhibitors of the PSMA (representing low molecular weight/high affinity binders) has intensified as they have found use in the clinical imaging of prostate tumours. Reported herein are the design, synthesis and evaluation of a new fluorinated PSMA targeting small-molecule, FDA-PEG-GUL, which possesses the Glu-NH-CO-NH-Lys pharmacophore conjugated to a 5'-fluorodeoxy-adenosine unit. Inhibition assays were performed with FDA-PEG-GUL which revealed that it inhibits the PSMA in the nanomolar range. Additionally, it has been purposely designed so that it can be produced using the fluorinase enzyme from its chlorinated precursor, allowing for the enzymatic synthesis of radiolabelled [18F]FDA-PEG-GUL via a nucleophilic reaction that takes place in experimentally advantageous conditions (in water at neutral pH and at ambient temperature). Specific binding of [18F]FDA-PEG-GUL to PSMA expressing cancer cells was demonstrated, validating it as a promising PSMA diagnostic tool.

Clinical trials must be performed according to the principles of Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and the trial sponsor has an obligation to ensure that all of the personnel involved in the trial have undergone training relevant to their role. Pathologists who are involved in the delivery of clinical trials are often required to undergo formal GCP training and may additionally undergo Good Clinical Laboratory Practice training if they are involved in the laboratory analysis of trials samples. Further training can be provided via trial-specific investigator meetings, which may be either multidisciplinary or discipline-specific events. Pathologists should also ensure that they undertake External Quality Assurance schemes relevant to the area of diagnostic practice required in the trial. The level of engagement of pathologists in academia and clinical trials research has declined in the United Kingdom over recent years. This paper recommends the optimal training and accreditation for pathologists undertaking clinical trials activities with the aim of facilitating increased engagement. Clinical trials training should ideally be provided to all pathologists through centrally organised educational events, with additional training provided to pathologists in training through local postgraduate teaching.

Both malignant and normal prostate cells release two types of EVs into the circulation, exosomes, and microparticles/microvesicles which differ in size, origin, and mode of release. Determining what proportion of prostate-derived EVs are of exosomal versus microparticle/microvesicle EV subtype is of potential diagnostic significance.  Materials and methods:   Multi-parametric analytical platforms such as nanoscale flow cytometry (nFC) were used to analyze prostate derived extracellular vesicles. Plasmas from prostate cancer (PCa) patient plasmas representing benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), low grade prostate cancer (Gleason Score 3 + 3) and high grade prostate cancer (Gleason Score ≥4 + 4) were analyzed for various exosome markers (CD9, CD63, CD81) and a prostate specific tissue marker (prostate specific membrane antigen/PSMA).  Results:   By using nanoscale flow cytometry, we determine that prostate derived EVs are primarily of cell membrane origin, microparticles/microvesicles, and not all PSMA expressing EVs co-express exosomal markers such as CD9, CD63, and CD81. CD9 was the most abundant exosomal marker on prostate derived EVs (12-19%). There was no trend observed in terms of more PSMA + CD9 or PSMA + CD63 co-expressing EVs versus increasing grade of prostate cancer.  Conclusion:   The majority of prostate derived EVs present in plasmas are from the cell membrane as evidenced by their size and most importantly, lack of co-expression of exosomal markers such as CD9/CD63/CD81. In fact, CD81 was not present on any prostate derived EVs in patient plasmas whereas CD9 was present on a minority of prostate derived EVs. The addition of an exosomal marker for detection of prostate-derived EVs does not provide greater clarity in distinguishing EVs released by the prostate.""","""['Ranjit S Padda', 'Florence K Deng', 'Sabine I Brett', 'Colleen N Biggs', 'Paul N Durfee', 'Charles J Brinker', 'Karla C Williams', 'Hon S Leong']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Prostate extracellular vesicles in patient plasma as a liquid biopsy platform for prostate cancer using nanoscale flow cytometry.', 'Prostate-specific extracellular vesicles as a novel biomarker in human prostate cancer.', 'Extracellular vesicles isolated from porcine seminal plasma exhibit different tetraspanin expression profiles.', 'Extracellular vesicles from activated platelets: a semiquantitative cryo-electron microscopy and immuno-gold labeling study.', 'Extracellular vesicles for personalized therapy decision support in advanced metastatic cancers and its potential impact for prostate cancer.', 'Small extracellular vesicles: a novel drug delivery system for neurodegenerative disorders.', 'Heat shock protein A2 is a novel extracellular vesicle-associated protein.', 'Medium Extracellular Vesicles-A Qualitative and Quantitative Biomarker of Prostate Cancer.', 'Circulating Exosome Cargoes Contain Functionally Diverse Cancer Biomarkers: From Biogenesis and Function to Purification and Potential Translational Utility.', 'Overview of extracellular vesicle characterization techniques and introduction to combined reflectance and fluorescence confocal microscopy to distinguish extracellular vesicle subpopulations.']"""

During RB oncogenesis, sonic hedgehog (SHH) is commonly differentially expressed. Additionally, microRNAs (miRs) are known to serve crucial roles as oncogenes or tumor suppressors. Specifically, miR-361-3p has been revealed to serve a vital role in cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, cervical cancer, prostate cancer, colorectal cancer, gastric cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, breast cancer and lung cancer. However, the role of miR-361-3p in RB and the potential molecular mechanisms involved remain unknown. Therefore, the current study aimed to determine the involvement of miR-361-3p in the development of RB by targeting SHH signaling. In the present study, miR-361-3p expression levels in RB tissue and serum samples obtained from 10 patients with RB, normal retinal tissue and serum samples obtained from 10 healthy controls, and two human RB cell lines (Y79 and Weri-Rb-1) were determined using reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction. In addition, a cell counting kit-8 assay, a cell transfection assay, a MTT assay, western blotting, a tumor sphere formation assay and a luciferase assay were used to assess the expression, function and molecular mechanism of miR-361-3p in human RB. It was demonstrated that miR-361-3p was significantly downregulated in RB tissues, RB serum and RB cell lines compared with normal retinal tissues and normal serum. The ectopic expression of miR-361-3p decreased RB cell proliferation and stemness. Furthermore, GLI1 and GLI3 were verified as potential direct targets of miR-361-3p. miR-361-3p was also revealed to exhibit a negative correlation with GLI1/3 expression in RB samples. Taken together, the results indicate that miR-361-3p functions as a tumor suppressor in the carcinogenesis and progression of RB by targeting SHH signaling. Thus, miR-361-3p should be further assessed as a potential therapeutic target for RB treatment.""","""['Dan Zhao', 'Zhe Cui']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Exp Ther Med""","""['MicroRNA-101-3p inhibits proliferation in retinoblastoma cells by targeting EZH2 and HDAC9.', 'microRNA -378a-3p Restrains the Proliferation of Retinoblastoma Cells but Promotes Apoptosis of Retinoblastoma Cells via Inhibition of FOXG1.', 'MicroRNA-34b-5p inhibits proliferation, stemness, migration and invasion of retinoblastoma cells via Notch signaling.', 'MicroRNA-129-5p suppresses proliferation, migration and invasion of retinoblastoma cells through PI3K/AKT signaling pathway by targeting PAX6.', 'Role of microRNA-7 in digestive system malignancy.', 'The functional role of circular RNAs in the pathogenesis of retinoblastoma: a new potential biomarker and therapeutic target?', 'The role of Hedgehog and Notch signaling pathway in cancer.', 'Role of lncRNA MIAT/miR-361-3p/CCAR2 in prostate cancer cells.', 'Emerging role of non-coding RNAs in the regulation of Sonic Hedgehog signaling pathway.', 'Integrated analysis of multiple bioinformatics studies to identify microRNA-target gene-transcription factor regulatory networks in retinoblastoma.']"""

Results:   During median follow-up of 9.9 years after the diagnosis, 182 men died from PCa.

Results:   This study analyzed 393 men; the utility values are as follows: first, health status postoperatively showed that the utility value decreased in patients who underwent ORP versus those who underwent LRP. The utility value for ORP and LRP versus RARP was reduced by ~0.028 (10 days per year) and 0.008 (3 days per year), respectively. Second, the utility value based on adverse effects after RP indicated that erectile dysfunction caused a greater reduction in efficacy than urinary incontinence. Regarding erectile dysfunction and urinary incontinence, the efficacy was reduced to ~0.137 (50 days per year) and 0.111 (41 days per year), respectively, as compared to a health state without adverse effects based on no evidence of disease status.

The reasons vary and include fear of treatment outcome as well as treatment induced side effects. The patient frequently experiences simultaneously various side effects resulting in a diminishing of the patient's health-related quality of life (HRQoL). The study provides evidence on the co-occurrence and inter-relations between pain, anxiety, depression and fatigue in patients with breast and prostate cancer.  Design:   This paper presents a secondary analysis of the data from a randomised control trial designed to test the effectiveness of guided imagery and progressive muscle relaxation on pain, fatigue, anxiety and depression. Non-parametric bootstrapping analyses were used to test the mediational model of anxiety, fatigue and depression as parallel mediators of the relationship between pain and HRQoL.  Setting:   The study was undertaken at the home setting.  Participants:   In total 208 patients were included in the study (assigned equally in two groups), referred at the outpatient clinics of the three participating cancer care centres.  Results:   The three mediators fully mediate the relationship between pain and HRQoL indirect effect (IEoverall=-0.3839, 95% CI: lower limit (LL)=-0.5073 to upper limit (UL)=-0.2825) indicating that patients with increased pain are likely to have higher levels of anxiety, fatigue and depression. Gender significantly moderated the mediational effect of Fatigue Index of Moderated Mediation (IMM=-0.2867 SE=0.1526, LL=-0.6127, UL=-0.0226) but did not moderate mediational effect of anxiety (IMM=-0.0709, SE=0.1414, LL=-0.3459, UL=+0.2089). The results show that the three mediators in a serial causal order fully mediate the relationship between pain and HRQoL (IEoverall=-0.384, 95% CI: LL=-0.51 to UL=-0.284) and the ratio of the overall indirect effect to the total effect is 0.8315 (95% CI: LL=0.5683 to UL=1.1718).

Methods:   18 prostate patients (74 Gy in 37 fractions) were selected. Each patient had a planning CT and cone-beam CT (CBCT) images acquired at different fractions. For each fraction, the planning CT was registered to the CBCT image dataset using SmartAdapt. A rigid registration was performed prior to the DIR. The manual contours on the CBCT images by the clinician were used as reference. For the geometric analysis, various evaluation metrics were used to compare the volumes for both rigid and DIR. For the dosimetric analysis, the initial treatment plan was recalculated on the smartadapted structures, using Eclipse. Several Dose-Volume Histogram (DVH) points were used for the evaluation.  Results:   The results of the geometric analysis indicate that DIR can result in worse evaluation metrics than rigid registration alone. In general, SmartAdapt tends to under-contour the volumes. The difference in DVH points between the deformed and the reference prostate was worse than the difference between the planning CT and the reference, overestimating the need for re-planning. However, there was a tendency for the deformed rectum to underestimate the need for re-planning.

We aimed to identify CpG sites, at which DNA methylation is related to urinary 8-isoprostane levels (biomarker of lipid peroxidation) and cancer or mortality outcomes. This investigation was based on a German, population-based cohort with linkage to cancer and mortality registry data (2000-2016).  Results:   Blood DNA methylation in promoter regions of 519 genes, known to be involved in pathways from oxidative stress (OS) to cancer, was obtained at the cohort's baseline examination. Inverse associations of DNA methylation at cg25365794 (ALOXE3) and cg08862778 (MTOR) with 8-isoprostane levels were observed in a derivation set (n = 1000) and validated in two independent subsets of the cohort (n = 548 and n = 741). Multivariate regression models were used to evaluate the associations of DNA methylation at the two CpG sites with lung, colorectal, prostate, breast, and overall cancer incidence as well as CVD, cancer, and all-cause mortality. DNA methylation at cg25365794 (ALOXE3) was inversely associated with lung and prostate cancer incidence. DNA methylation at cg08862778 (MTOR) was associated with a 43% lower breast cancer incidence in the top vs. bottom tertile.  Conclusion:   The finding for ALOXE3 may not be causal. As ALOXE3 is mainly expressed in skin tissue, the observed association might reflect the fact that both DNA methylation at the ALOXE3 gene and urinary 8-isoprostane concentrations depend on the level of OS in tissues. Contrarily, the finding for the MTOR gene and breast cancer is biologically plausible because the MTOR protein plays an important role in PI3K/Akt signaling, which is a pathway related to cancer development and cell senescence.""","""['Xīn Gào', 'Yan Zhang', 'Barbara Burwinkel', 'Yang Xuan', 'Bernd Holleczek', 'Hermann Brenner', 'Ben Schöttker']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Clin Epigenetics""","""['Urinary 8-isoprostane levels and occurrence of lung, colorectal, prostate, breast and overall cancer: Results from a large, population-based cohort study with 14 years of follow-up.', 'Associations of self-reported smoking, cotinine levels and epigenetic smoking indicators with oxidative stress among older adults: a population-based study.', 'Discovery of a novel epigenetic cancer marker related to the oxidative status of human blood.', 'Gene methylation in gastric cancer.', 'Serine and one-carbon metabolism, a bridge that links mTOR signaling and DNA methylation in cancer.', 'Diagnostic significance and utility of circulating redox biomarkers in patients with gastric cancer - preliminary study.', 'Cardiovascular correlates of epigenetic aging across the adult lifespan: a population-based study.', 'DNA methylation and mRNA expression of glutathione S-transferase alpha 4 are associated with intracranial aneurysms in a gender-dependent manner.', 'Oxidative Stress and Redox Signaling in the Pathophysiology of Liver Diseases.', 'Halophilic Carotenoids and Breast Cancer: From Salt Marshes to Biomedicine.']"""

Methods: The aSi-kVCBCT is used widely in radiotherapy to verify the patient position before treatment. The advancement in aSi-kVCBCT combined with adaptive software allows us to verify the dose distribution in daily acquired CBCT images. CBCT images from 10 patients undergoing radical prostate radiotherapy were included in this study. Patients received total dose of 65Gy in 25 fractions using volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT). aSi-kVCBCT scans were acquired before daily treatment and exported to smart adapt software for image adaptation. The planning CT is adapted to daily aSi-kVCBCT images in terms of HU mapping. The primary VMAT plans were copied on to the adapted planning CT images and dose was calculated using Anisotropic Analytic Algorithm (AAA). The DVH is then used to evaluate the volume changes of organs at risk (OAR), the actual dose received by OARs, CTV and PTV during a single fraction. Results: The normalized volume of the bladder and rectum ranged from 0.70–1.66 and 0.70–1.16 respectively.

A patient with scabies surrepticius is described: a man with scabies masquerading as prurigo nodularis. The 91-year-old man had metastatic prostate cancer and presented with diffuse pruritic nodules. Prurigo nodularis was suspected; however, the biopsy revealed scabies mites in the stratum corneum. He was successfully treated with topical permethrin 5% cream and oral ivermectin. In addition, the features of a woman with scabies mimicking systemic lupus erythematosus are summarized. The 47-year-old woman had idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura and presented with malar erythema and a positive antinuclear antibody (titer 1:320). A diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematous was entertained until skin scraping and mineral oil preparation revealed scabies mites; she was successfully treated with oral ivermectin. In conclusion, Sarcoptes scabiei infestation can present with atypical clinical morphology and an absence of classical lesions such as burrows conventionally distributed in the interdigital web spaces, volar wrists, periumbilical area, or genitalia.

IL6 and VEGFA were found only in crisis state, while IL-1B was found exclusively in steady state. The regulator effects analysis revealed IgG1 as an upstream regulator in steady state compared to healthy individuals, resulting in invasion of prostate cancer cell lines as the disease/function outcome. For crisis-state patients versus healthy individuals, two networks of regulator effects revealed STAT1, CD40LG, TGM2, IRF7, IRF4, and IRF1 acting as upstream regulators, resulting in disease/function outcomes, including engulfment of cells and aggregation of blood cells and inflammation of joints.

Objective:   To examine if adding ADT was cost-effective when accounting for ADT-related long-term side effects in men with prostate cancer.  Methods:   For this cost-utility analysis, we used the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-Medicare linked database to estimate and compare patient survival, costs from a health payer's perspective, and cost-effectiveness of 3 treatment modalities for advanced prostate cancer patients, including radiation therapy, radiation plus ADT, and active surveillance. We also estimated quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) by assigning appropriate health state utility values obtained from the literature for each phase of care and for long-term side effects. Propensity score matching was used to control for bias and confounding that were inherent to the observational study design.  Results:   Adding ADT to radiation therapy increased median patient survival by 0.71 years. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for radiation plus ADT versus radiation alone was $63,049 and $295,995 per mean life-year gained for radiation compared with active surveillance, respectively. Treatment-associated adverse side effects substantially reduced QALYs gained. Compared with radiation only, the incremental cost of radiation plus ADT was $127,900 per mean QALY and was nearly 80% cost-effective at a willingness-to-pay threshold of $210,000 per QALY.  Conclusions:   Despite ADT-associated costs and long-term side effects, compared with radiation alone, radiation plus ADT was cost-effective at $127,900 per QALY.

Methods: One-hundred and twenty-five cancer survivors of breast, prostate, colorectal or haematological cancers (response rate: 72%) completed measures of psychological distress (BSI-18), unmet needs (CASUN), social support (ESSI), coping styles (Mini-MAC), symptom prevalence (MSAS-SF) and benefit finding (PTGI) immediately after treatment and three and six months later. Distress and its predictors were investigated using linear mixed models. Groups based on Bonnano's trajectories were also compared on demographic, medical and psychosocial characteristics. Results: Changes in psychological distress over time were not statistically significant. Using BSI-18 clinical cut-off scores, most survivors (n = 65, 80%) were 'resilient', with stable, low distress levels. Almost one-tenth of survivors (n = 7, 9%) reported persistent, 'clinically significant' distress. Compared with the 'resilient' group, this 'chronic' group reported higher unmet needs, benefit finding, physical symptoms and poor coping styles, as well as lower social support immediately after treatment. They were also more likely to have a documented history of psychiatric illness. A 'recovered' group (n = 5, 6%) experienced high levels of distress that quickly returned to non-clinical levels and a delayed group (n = 4, 5%) reported initial low distress which worsened after treatment completion. Conclusions: Most survivors experience low distress (resilience) over time and may not require intense follow-up care. Screening for distress at the end of treatment may help to identify patients with more physical symptoms and unmet needs, less social support and higher use of maladaptive coping styles who are at risk of experiencing non-resilient trajectories of distress for further management of these symptoms.""","""['Kerryann Lotfi-Jam', 'Karla Gough', 'Penelope Schofield', 'Sanchia Aranda', 'Michael Jefford']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Acta Oncol""","""['Coping Strategies Used by Breast, Prostate, and Colorectal Cancer Survivors: A Literature Review.', 'Cancer-coping profile predicts long-term psychological functions and quality of life in cancer survivors.', 'Trajectories of psychological distress after colorectal cancer.', 'Preparedness and Cancer-Related Symptom Management among Cancer Survivors in the First Year Post-Treatment.', 'Psychosocial distress in haematological cancer survivors: An integrative review.', 'Effect of multidisciplinary collaborative empowerment education on psychological distress and quality of life in patients with colorectal cancer undergoing chemotherapy.', 'Couples Coping With Hematological Cancer: Support Within and Outside the Couple - Findings From a Qualitative Analysis of Dyadic Interviews.', 'Trajectories of adjustment disorder symptoms in post-treatment breast cancer survivors.', 'Symptom burden, psychological distress, and health-related quality of life in cancer survivors with pelvic late radiation tissue injuries.', 'The State of the Science on Cancer Diagnosis as a ""Teachable Moment"" for Smoking Cessation: A Scoping Review.']"""

Understanding the role of medication use on PCa risk may clarify the pathophysiological changes and mechanisms in development of cancer.  Methods:   This study investigated PCa risk in relation to overall use of anti-hypertensive drugs and those with specific mechanisms of action. The study cohort (78,615 men) was linked to the prescription database to obtain information on medication use during 20-year follow-up. Information was obtained on PCa diagnoses, causes of deaths, and for a sub-set on B.M.I. and use of non-prescription drugs. Time-dependent drug use variables hazard ratios (HR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated using Cox regression analyses.  Results:   Use of antihypertensive drugs slightly increased PCa risk (HR = 1.16, 95% CI = 1.11-1.22). The risk increase was clearest for metastatic PCa (HR = 1.36, 95% CI = 1.14-1.62).

However, little is known about the pathophysiology behind symptoms or the effect of treatment. The aim of the present study was to present the results of clinical evaluation and treatment of patients with chronic bowel symptoms after treatment for cancer in the colon or pelvic organs. Material and methods: All patients referred to our department of gastroenterology between May 2016 and June 2018 with chronic bowel symptoms after treatment for cancer in the colon or pelvic organs were prospectively evaluated. Results: In total, 60 patients had been referred. The patients were treated for cancer in the right colon (n = 31), sigmoid colon (n = 1), rectum (n = 14), anal canal (n = 4), cervix uteri (n = 5), corpus uteri (n = 2), ovary (n = 2), and prostate (n = 1). The median time from cancer treatment to referral was 5.5 (range 1-36) years. Symptoms mainly included frequent bowel movements (65%), loose stools (87%), urgency for defecation (57%), and fecal incontinence (50%). A specific cause of bowel dysfunction was found in 48 (80%) of the patients and 21 (35%) had more than one cause of bowel symptoms. Bile acid malabsorption was present in 35 patients and small intestinal bacterial overgrowth was detected in 32. Treatment included bile acid sequestrants (n = 36), antibiotics (n = 33), loperamide (n = 21), and dietary intervention (n = 20).

We included 48 patients with mCRPC who were treated with 177Lu-PSMA-617 and whose records included 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT imaging before the first and after the third or fourth treatment cycle. A treatment response based on 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT was defined according to a modified version of the PERCIST criteria. A decline in PSA level of ≥50% was considered the reference standard. The sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, and ROC curves were calculated, and patient survival times in relation to the PET results were also analysed.  Results: 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT had a sensitivity of about 85% and a specificity of between 55% and 65%. The negative and positive predictive values ranged between 70% and 78%.

Previous studies suggest that allopurinol use might decrease the risk of prostate cancer (PCa) among gout patients. We studied the association between allopurinol use and PCa incidence.  Methods:   The cohort consists of 76,874 men without prevalent PCa, originally identified for the Finnish Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer (FinRSPC). The follow-up started at entry to the trial. We excluded men using allopurinol in the year before entry (wash-out). PCa cases detected during 1996-2015 were identified from the Finnish Cancer Registry. Information on tumor Gleason score and TNM stage were obtained from medical files. Information on PSA level was obtained from screening samples for men in the FinRSPC screening arm and from laboratory databases for men in the control arm. Information on BMI was based on a questionnaire sent to men in the FinRSPC screening arm in 2004-2008. Drug purchase information were obtained from the national prescription database. We used Cox regression (adjusted for age, FinRSPC trial arm, PCa family history and use of other medication) to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of PCa risk by allopurinol use. We analyzed medication as a time-dependent variable to minimize immortal time bias.  Results:   There were 9062 new PCa diagnoses in the cohort. Follow-up time did not differ by allopurinol use (median 17 yr; IQR 11-19 vs median 17 yr; IQR 12.33-19). The risk of PCa did not differ by allopurinol use (multivariable adjusted HR 1.03; 95% CI 0.92-1.16). Allopurinol use did not associate with the risk of high-grade or metastatic cancer. Cumulative duration or average yearly dose of allopurinol use showed no association with PCa risk. No delayed risk associations were observed in the lag-time analyses.

Afterwards each pair was co-registered. First, we trained a U-Net to segment epithelial structures in IHC using a subset of the IHC slides that were preprocessed with color deconvolution. Second, this network was applied to the remaining slides to create the reference standard used to train a second U-Net on H&E.

Here, we report on the clinicopathological characteristics of Korean patients with NUT carcinoma and the in vitro efficacy of MYC-targeting agents against patient-derived NUT carcinoma cell lines.  Materials and methods:   Thirteen patients with NUT carcinoma were evaluated for p53, C-MYC, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), HER2, and programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) by immunohistochemistry. The half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) values of NUT carcinoma cell lines (SNU-2972-1, SNU-3178S, HCC2429, and Ty-82) were determined using MYC-targeting agents, including bromodomain and extraterminal (BET) inhibitors (I-BET, OTX-015, AZD5153) and histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors (vorinostat, romidepsin, panobinostat, CUDC-907).  Results:   Primary tumor sites included head and neck (n = 9) and lung (n = 4). The patient age ranged from 8 to 73 years with the male/female ratio of 1.2:1. Nine patients died at 3-23.6 months (median, 10.6) after diagnosis. Eight patients had been misdiagnosed initially with other diseases. One patient with metastatic NUT carcinoma who received mass excision plus metastasectomy followed by chemoradiotherapy was a long-term survivor (>27 months). Although expressions of C-MYC (8/12, 73%) and p53 (12/12, 100%) were commonly observed, EGFR, HER2, and PD-L1 expressions were observed in 2 of 7 (29%), 2 of 8 (25%), and 1 of 12 (8.3%) patients, respectively. BET and HDAC inhibitors showed variable but limited in vitro efficacy. However, a dual HDAC/PI3K inhibitor, CUDC-907, was most potent against NUT carcinoma cells, with an IC50 of 5.5-9.0 pmol/L. Consistent with these findings, kinome short interfering RNA screening showed a positive hit for PI3KCA in NUT carcinoma cells. Panobinostat (IC50, 0.4-1.3 nmol/L) and a bivalent BET inhibitor, AZD5153 (IC50, 3.7-8.2 nmol/L), also showed remarkable efficacies.  Conclusion:   East Asian patients with NUT carcinoma showed dismal survival outcomes like Western patients, and CUDC-907 might be promising in NUT carcinoma treatment.  Implications for practice:   NUT carcinoma (NC) is a disease caused by BRD-NUT fusion leading to C-MYC upregulation. NC is often misdiagnosed and very aggressive, requiring development of effective therapeutic strategy. This article presents the clinicopathological features of the largest series of NCs in East Asians and preclinical sensitivities to MYC-targeting agents in NC cell lines. Patients with NC had grave outcomes and poor response to treatment. Among MYC-targeting agents, including BET and HDAC inhibitors, CUDC-907 (a dual PI3K/HDAC inhibitor) was most effective against NC cells, followed by panobinostat (an HDAC inhibitor) and AZD5153 (a bivalent BET inhibitor).

However, the potential factors influencing the accuracy of 3DUS in comparison with cone-beam CT (CBCT) in IGRT for PCa patients haven't been clearly identified.  Methods:   The differences between US/US and CBCT/CT registrations were analyzed over 586 and 580 sessions for 24 and 25 PCa patients treated with or without pelvic lymph node irradiation, respectively. The clinical factors that may influence registration differences were also evaluated.  Results:   The average discrepancies between US/US and CBCT/CT registrations were - 0.28 ± 5.28 mm, - 0.16 ± 3.48 mm, and - 0.47 ± 4.31 mm in the superior-inferior (SI), left-right (LR), and anterior-posterior (AP) directions, respectively.

However, the signatures regarding DNA methylation changes for pan-cancer diagnosis and prognosis are less explored. Here we systematically analyzed the genome-wide DNA methylation patterns in diverse TCGA cancers with machine learning. We identified seven CpG sites that could effectively discriminate tumor samples from adjacent normal tissue samples for 12 main cancers of TCGA (1216 samples, AUC > 0.99). Those seven potential diagnostic biomarkers were further validated in the other 9 different TCGA cancers and 4 independent datasets (AUC > 0.92). Three out of the seven CpG sites were correlated with cell division, DNA replication and cell cycle. We also identified 12 CpG sites that can effectively distinguish 26 different cancers (7605 samples), and the result was repeatable in independent datasets as well as two disparate tumors with metastases (micro-average AUC > 0.89). Furthermore, a series of potential signatures that could significantly predict the prognosis of tumor patients for 7 different cancer were identified via survival analysis (p-value < 1e-4).

However, few data are available on the perioperative and oncological outcomes of specific organ invasion.  Materials and methods:   A total of 917 consecutive bladder cancer (BCa) patients treated with radical cystectomy (RC) at a single institution between 1990 and 2015 were studies. Cox regression analyses were used to stratify pT4ab according to the site of invasion and survival.  Results:   Overall, 176 (19.2%) and 40 (4.4%) patients harbored pT4a or pT4b disease. Specifically, 84 (9.2%) patients reported prostate and/or SVI invasion, 62 (6.8%) prostate only, 16 (1.7%) uterus, 14 (1.5%) vaginal, 24 (2.6%) pelvic wall, and 16 (1.7%) abdominal wall invasion. The median follow-up in pT4 patients was 48 months. The 1-year cancer-specific mortality (CSM) rates were 71, 65, 24, 50, 50, and 72%, for vaginal, uterus, prostate only, prostate and/or seminal vesicles, pelvic wall, and abdominal wall invasions, respectively. At multivariable Cox regression, the invasion of prostate only (hazard ratio [HR] 3.53), prostate and/or SVI (HR 4.98), uterus (HR 7.16), vagina (HR 6.12), pelvic (HR 11.81), abdominal (8.36) were associated with adverse CSM.  Conclusions:   Our study described the differences in survival related to invasion site in pT4 patients, confirming poor survival expectancies in this subgroup. Patients with prostate invasion only seem to be associated with better survival than those affected by concomitant invasion of seminal vesicles. Uterus and vaginal invasions were associated with poor survival outcomes. Patients Summary: In this study, we looked at the outcome of locally advanced invasive BCa (stage pT4) in patients treated with RC at a tertiary referral hospital. We analyzed the differences in survival related to the specific organ invasion. We confirmed poor survival in this subgroup of patients. Only patients who had prostate invasion only seem to have a better survival.""","""['Marco Moschini', 'Stefania Zamboni', 'Agostino Mattei', 'Philipp Baumeister', 'Carlo Di Bona', 'Julian Cornelius', 'Shahrokh F Shariat', 'Massimo Freschi', 'Emanuele Zaffuto', 'Andrea Salonia', 'Francesco Montorsi', 'Alberto Briganti', 'Renzo Colombo', 'Andrea Gallina;OspedaleSanRaffaele']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Urol Int""","""['Comparative analysis of the effect of prostatic invasion patterns on cancer-specific mortality after radical cystectomy in pT4a urothelial carcinoma of the bladder.', 'Is stage pT4a (D1) reliable in assessing transitional cell carcinoma involvement of the prostate in patients with a concurrent bladder cancer?

However, it is difficult to register pseudo-CT images to cone-beam CT (CBCT) images collected for image-guided radiation therapy (IGRT), because of the lack of contrasts among tissues. We validated gaps of IGRT between pseudo-CT or planning CT and CBCT for patients without implanted markers. We also propose calcification-assisted registration for MR-only simulation. We conducted retrospective analyses to verify the registration accuracy in 15 patients who underwent volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) for prostate cancer. They underwent planning CT and pseudo-CT. Pseudo-CT images after deformable image registration (DIR) to planning CT images were rendered automatic pelvic bone matching to CBCT images. Patient positions on the pseudo-CT images after DIR were shifted on the basis of tissues around the prostate. We compared registration gaps between the images of planning CT and pseudo-CT with DIR, assuming that the tissue-based matching between the planning CT and CBCT was the gold standard. To the pseudo-CT images with DIR, calcifications detected on planning CT were added. We validated IGRT accuracy for a calcification-assisted registration. The absolute registration errors of the pseudo-CT, in comparison with the planning CT, were 0.34 ± 0.50 (lateral), 1.3 ± 1.3 (longitudinal), and 1.1 ± 1.0 mm (vertical). The absolute registration errors of the pseudo-CT with calcification contouring, in comparison with the planning CT, were 0.41 ± 1.0 (lateral), 0.87 ± 0.92 (longitudinal), and 0.74 ± 0.64 mm (vertical). Reduced absolute registration errors were observed in the proposed approach in the longitudinal (P < 0.01) and vertical (P < 0.01) dimensions when using calcification-assisted registration. The tissue-based registration using the MR-only simulation was not sufficient for use in patients with prostate cancer without implanted markers.

Materials and methods:   We reviewed the records of men in the Michigan Urological Surgery Improvement Collaborative with newly diagnosed favorable risk prostate cancer. Following diagnostic biopsy the men were classified into 3 groups, including group 1-no magnetic resonance imaging, group 2-magnetic resonance imaging only and group 3-magnetic resonance imaging/post-magnetic resonance imaging biopsy. For the purposes of counseling and shared decision making magnetic resonance imaging results were deemed reassuring (PI-RADS™ [Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System] 3 or less) or nonreassuring (PI-RADS 4 or greater). Similarly, if the diagnostic biopsy was GG (Grade Group) 1, post-magnetic resonance imaging biopsy results were deemed nonreassuring if there was any amount of GG 2 or greater. If the diagnostic biopsy was GG 2, post-magnetic resonance imaging biopsy results were deemed nonreassuring if more than 3 cores were GG 2, or there was more than 50% GG 2 in any individual core or any volume of GG 3 or greater.  Results:   Of 1,461 men with favorable risk prostate cancer 1,223 (84%) did not undergo magnetic resonance imaging, 157 (11%) underwent magnetic resonance imaging alone and 81 (6%) underwent magnetic resonance imaging and post-magnetic resonance imaging biopsy. Of the men who underwent magnetic resonance imaging alone more with reassuring findings elected active surveillance than men with nonreassuring or magnetic resonance imaging findings (74% vs 35% and 42%, respectively). The highest rate of active surveillance was noted in men with reassuring post-magnetic resonance imaging biopsy regardless of whether magnetic resonance imaging was reassuring or nonreassuring (93% and 96%, respectively).  Conclusions:   Magnetic resonance imaging and post-magnetic resonance imaging biopsy drive decision making in men with newly diagnosed, favorable risk prostate cancer. Post-magnetic resonance imaging biopsy is a stronger driver of decision making than magnetic resonance imaging alone. This was demonstrated by the more than 90% of men with reassuring post-magnetic resonance imaging biopsies who elected active surveillance regardless of magnetic resonance imaging results.""","""['Kevin B Ginsburg', 'Rohith Arcot', 'Ji Qi', 'Susan M Linsell', 'Deborah R Kaye', 'Arvin K George', 'Michael L Cher;MUSIC']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""J Urol""","""['Editorial Comment.', 'The added influence of genomics and post-MRI confirmatory biopsy results to MRI results alone on medical decision making for men with favorable risk prostate cancer being considered for active surveillance.', 'Diagnostic Accuracy and Prognostic Value of Serial Prostate Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging in Men on Active Surveillance for Prostate Cancer.', 'Is it Time to Perform Only Magnetic Resonance Imaging Targeted Cores?

Materials and methods:   We retrospectively analyzed the records of 803 consecutive patients, including 703 males and 100 females, who underwent orthotopic bladder substitution as well as pre-cystectomy biopsy of the prostatic urethra in males and the bladder neck in females, at our institution between April 1986 and December 2017.  Results:   Pre-cystectomy biopsies were negative in 755 of the 803 patients (94%) (group 1) and positive in 48 (6%) (group 2). Biopsies in group 2 revealed carcinoma in situ in 35 of the 48 cases (73%), pTaG1/G2 in 5 (10%) and pTaG3/pT1G3 in 8 (17%). Median followup was 64 months (IQR 21-128). At a median followup of 56 months (IQR 18-127) urethral recurrence developed in 45 of the 803 patients (5.6%), including 30 of the 755 (4%) in group 1 and 15 of the 48 (31.3%) in group 2 (p <0.001). Only 10 of the 45 patients (22%) with urethral recurrence required salvage urethrectomy while locally conservative treatment was successful in 27 (60%). Of the remaining 8 patients 6 of 45 (13%) underwent synchronous palliative chemotherapy and 2 of 45 (4%) refused treatment. Multivariate regression analysis revealed a higher risk of urethral recurrence if patients had positive pre-cystectomy biopsies (group 2 HR 6.49, 95% CI 3.33-12.62, p <0.001) or received neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy (HR 3.05, 95% CI 1.66-5.59, p <0.001). Cancer specific and overall survival as well as functional outcomes were similar in the 2 groups.  Conclusions:   Positive pre-cystectomy biopsies prior to orthotopic bladder substitution increased the urethral recurrence rate but did not lower cancer specific or overall survival. Most urethral recurrences were managed successfully by local treatment. Orthotopic bladder substitution is an option in highly selected patients with positive, noninvasive pre-cystectomy biopsies, provided that they undergo regular followup including urethral cytology.""","""['Beat Roth#', 'Marc Alain Furrer#', 'Ioannis Giannakis', 'Mihai Dorin Vartolomei', 'Silvan Boxler', 'Patrick Y Wuethrich', 'Fiona C Burkhard', 'George N Thalmann', 'Bernhard Kiss']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""J Urol""","""['Editorial Comment.', 'Editorial Comment.', 'The risk factor for urethral recurrence after radical cystectomy in patients with transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder.', 'Urethral recurrence in patients following orthotopic urinary diversion.', 'The role of preoperative prostatic urethral biopsy in clinical decision-making at the time of radical cystectomy.', 'Pathological guidelines for orthotopic urinary diversion in women with bladder cancer: a review of the literature.', 'The risk of urethral tumors in female bladder cancer: can the urethra be used for orthotopic reconstruction of the lower urinary tract?', 'Orthotopic bladder substitution: Surgical aspects and optimization of outcomes.']"""

Patients and methods:   In all, 205 men undergoing fusion biopsy and RP were divided into two groups: 136 in whom the MCCL came from an index MRI-visible lesion (TB) and 69 in whom MCCL came from a non-targeted lesion (non-targeted biopsy [NTB]). MRI was 3-T multi-parametric and biopsy was via MRI-ultrasonography fusion.  Results:   In the TB group, MCCL correlated with volume of clinically significant index tumours (ρ = 0.44-0.60, P < 0.01). The correlation was similar for first and repeat biopsy and for transition and peripheral zone lesions (ρ = 0.42-0.49, P < 0.01). No correlations were found in the NTB group. TB MCCL (6-10 and >10 mm) and MRI lesion diameter (>20 mm) were independently associated with tumour volume. TB MCCLs >10 mm and Gleason scores >7 were each associated with pathological T3 disease (odds ratios 5.73 and 5.04, respectively), but MRI lesion diameter lesion was not.  Conclusions:   MCCL on a TB from an MRI-visible lesion is an independent predictor of both cancer volume and pathological stage. This relationship does not exist for MCCL from a NTB core.

Today, people can obtain relevant information from not only medical workers in hospitals, but also the internet in any place in real-time. Search behaviors can reflect a population's awareness of cancer from a completely new perspective, which could be driven by the underlying cancer epidemiology. However, such Web-retrieved data are not yet well validated or understood.  Objective:   This study aimed to explore whether a correlation exists between the incidence and mortality of cancers and normalized internet search volumes on the big data platform, Baidu. We also assessed whether the distribution of people who searched for specific types of cancer differed by gender. Finally, we determined whether there were regional disparities among people who searched the Web for cancer-related information.  Methods:   Standard Boolean operators were used to choose search terms for each type of cancer. Spearman's correlation analysis was used to explore correlations among monthly search index values for each cancer type and their monthly incidence and mortality rates. We conducted cointegration analysis between search index data and incidence rates to examine whether a stable equilibrium existed between them. We also conducted cointegration analysis between search index data and mortality data.  Results:   The monthly Baidu index was significantly correlated with cancer incidence rates for 26 of 28 cancers in China (lung cancer: r=.80, P<.001; liver cancer: r=.28, P=.016; stomach cancer: r=.50, P<.001; esophageal cancer: r=.50, P<.001; colorectal cancer: r=.81, P<.001; pancreatic cancer: r=.86, P<.001; breast cancer: r=.56, P<.001; brain and nervous system cancer: r=.63, P<.001; leukemia: r=.75, P<.001; Non-Hodgkin lymphoma: r=.88, P<.001; Hodgkin lymphoma: r=.91, P<.001; cervical cancer: r=.64, P<.001; prostate cancer: r=.67, P<.001; bladder cancer: r=.62, P<.001; gallbladder and biliary tract cancer: r=.88, P<.001; lip and oral cavity cancer: r=.88, P<.001; ovarian cancer: r=.58, P<.001; larynx cancer: r=.82, P<.001; kidney cancer: r=.73, P<.001; squamous cell carcinoma: r=.94, P<.001; multiple myeloma: r=.84, P<.001; thyroid cancer: r=.77, P<.001; malignant skin melanoma: r=.55, P<.001; mesothelioma: r=.79, P<.001; testicular cancer: r=.57, P<.001; basal cell carcinoma: r=.83, P<.001). The monthly Baidu index was significantly correlated with cancer mortality rates for 24 of 27 cancers. In terms of the whole population, the number of women who searched for cancer-related information has slowly risen over time. People aged 30-39 years were most likely to use search engines to retrieve cancer-related knowledge. East China had the highest Web search volumes for cancer.  Conclusions:   Search behaviors indeed reflect public awareness of cancer from a different angle.

Materials and Methods This retrospective cross-sectional study included 330 consecutive patients (mean age, 64.3 years; range, 42-84 years) who underwent multiparametric prostate MRI from March 2012 to July 2017 and had an index lesion that subsequently underwent cognitive MRI-targeted biopsy using transrectal US with at least five core samples (which were sequentially labeled) per lesion. The detection rate of clinically significant cancer was calculated on sequential biopsy cores, comparing the first core alone versus three cores versus five cores per target. Clinically significant cancer was defined as International Society of Urological Pathology Grade Group 2 or higher. Results Increasing the number of biopsy core samples from one to three per target and from three to five per target increased the detection rate of clinically significant cancer by 6.4% (21 of 330) and 2.4% (eight of 330), respectively. The target yield for clinically significant cancer was 26% (87 of 330), 33% (108 of 330), and 35% (116 of 330) for one, three, and five cores, respectively.

However, it was reported that older adults are excluded or underrepresented in clinical trials for several diseases. We examined phase III clinical trials funded by the National Institutes of Health found in www.clinicaltrials.gov from 1965 to 2015 that addressed top causes for hospitalization and/or disability-adjusted life years in older adults: congestive heart failure (n = 45), cardiac dysrhythmias (n = 24), coronary atherosclerosis (n = 106), heart attack (n = 76), stroke (n = 113), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (n = 14), pneumonia (n = 48), lung cancer (n = 117), prostate cancer (n = 65), and osteoarthritis (n = 15). We then analyzed the representation of older adults in these studies. We found that 33% of studies had arbitrary upper age limits, and 67% of studies reported mean and/or median ages that skewed younger than expected for the disease or condition of interest.

In this study, we assessed the association between preoperative NLR and the clinicopathological characteristics, biomolecular features and prognosis of patients with localized prostate cancer treated with radical prostatectomy. A total of 994 subjects were retrospectively enrolled, and the histological specimens of 210 patients were retrieved for constructing a tissue microarray. Immunohistochemistry was then performed to assess the expression of AR, ERG, PTEN, p-AKT, Bcl-2, Beclin-1, Ki-67, CD3, CD4, CD8, IFN-γ and TNF-α. No significant differences in the NLR distributions among clinicopathological variables were observed (P > 0.05) when the original NLR data were utilized. When we dichotomized the NLR value into the high-NLR group (NLR ≥ 2) and low-NLR group (NLR < 2), we found that the patients in the high-NLR group had more prostate capsule invasion (P = 0.047). Additionally, no significant correlation was found between the NLR and infiltrating CD3+ cells, the CD4/CD8 ratio, AR, ERG, PTEN, p-AKT, Bcl-2, Beclin-1, Ki-67, IFN-γ or TNF-α (P > 0.05). When we analyzed the data of patients without postoperative adjuvant hormone therapy or radiotherapy, univariate and multivariate survival analysis indicated that a high NLR was a predictor of better BCR-free survival (P < 0.05). When analyzing the entire cohort, univariate survival analysis showed that the high-NLR group had significantly poorer overall survival (P < 0.05).

TBCT scanning provides virtual monoenergetic images which are attractive in treatment planning since lower energies offer better contrast for soft tissues, and higher energies reduce noise. A protocol is needed to achieve optimal performance of this feature. In this study, we investigated the TBCT scan schema with the head-and-neck radiotherapy workflow at our clinic and selected the optimal energy with best contrast-noise-ratio (CNR) in organs-at-risks (OARs) delineation for head-and-neck treatment planning.  Methods and materials:   We synthesized monochromatic images from 40 keV to 190 keV at 5 keV increments from data acquired by TBCT. We collected the Hounsfield unit (HU) numbers of OARs (brainstem, mandible, spinal cord, and parotid glands), the HU numbers of marginal regions outside OARs, and the noise levels for each monochromatic image. We then calculated the CNR for the different OARs at each energy level to generate a serial of spectral curves for each OAR. Based on these spectral curves of CNR, the mono-energy corresponding to the max CNR was identified for each OAR of each patient.  Results:   Computed tomography scans of ten patients by TBCT were used to test the optimal monoenergetic image for the CNR of OAR. Based on the maximized CNR, the optimal energy values were 78.5 ± 5.3 keV for the brainstem, 78.0 ± 4.2 keV for the mandible, 78.5 ± 5.7 keV for the parotid glands, and 78.5 ± 5.3 keV for the spinal cord. Overall, the optimal energy for the maximum CNR of these OARs in head-and-neck cancer patients was 80 keV.  Conclusion:   We have proposed a clinically feasible protocol that selects the optimal energy level of the virtual monoenergetic image in TBCT for OAR delineation based on the CNR in head-and-neck OAR. This protocol can be applied in TBCT simulation.""","""['Tonghe Wang', 'Beth Bradshaw Ghavidel', 'Jonathan J Beitler', 'Xiangyang Tang', 'Yang Lei', 'Walter J Curran', 'Tian Liu', 'Xiaofeng Yang']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""J Appl Clin Med Phys""","""['Virtual monoenergetic dual-energy computed tomography: optimization of kiloelectron volt settings in head and neck cancer.', 'Determination of the optimal range for virtual monoenergetic images in dual-energy CT based on physical quality parameters.', 'Impact of noise-optimized virtual monoenergetic dual-energy computed tomography on image quality in patients with renal cell carcinoma.', 'Applications of Dual-Energy Computed Tomography for Artifact Reduction in the Head, Neck, and Spine.', 'Auto-segmentation of organs at risk for head and neck radiotherapy planning: From atlas-based to deep learning methods.', 'Dual-energy CT based mass density and relative stopping power estimation for proton therapy using physics-informed deep learning.', 'Improving radiation physics, tumor visualisation, and treatment quantification in radiotherapy with spectral or dual-energy CT.', 'Learning-based synthetic dual energy CT imaging from single energy CT for stopping power ratio calculation in proton radiation therapy.', 'Knowledge-based radiation treatment planning: A data-driven method survey.', 'Head and neck single- and dual-energy CT: differences in radiation dose and image quality of 2nd and 3rd generation dual-source CT.']"""

Monoamine oxidase inhibitors are used to treat atypical depression. MAOA is highly expressed in high grade prostate cancer and modulates tumorigenesis and progression in prostate cancer. Here, we investigated the potential role of MAOA inhibitors (MAOAIs) in relation to the androgen receptor (AR) pathway and resistance to antiandrogen treatment in prostate cancer.  Methods:   We examined MAOA expression and the effect of MAOI treatment in relation to AR-targeted treatments using the LNCaP, C4-2B, and 22Rv1 human prostate cancer cell lines. MAOA, AR-full length (AR-FL), AR splice variant 7 (AR-V7), and PSA expression was evaluated in the presence of MAOAIs (clorgyline, phenelzine), androgenic ligand (R1881), and antiandrogen (enzalutamide) treatments. An enzalutamide resistance cell line was generated to test the effect of MAOAI treatment in this model.  Results:   We observed that MAOAIs, particularly clorgyline and phenelzine, were effective at decreasing MAOA activity in human prostate cancer cells. MAOAIs significantly decreased growth of LNCaP, C4-2B, and 22Rv1 cells and produced additive growth inhibitory effects when combined with enzalutamide. Clorgyline decreased expression of AR-FL and AR-V7 in 22Rv1 cells and was effective at decreasing growth of an enzalutamide-resistant C4-2B cell line with increased AR-V7 expression.  Conclusions:   MAOAIs decrease growth and proliferation of androgen-sensitive and castration-resistant prostate cancer cells. Clorgyline, in particular, decreases expression of AR-FL and AR-V7 expression and decreases growth of an enzalutamide-resistant cell line.

Prostate cancer patients at advanced stages are usually treated with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). However, with disease progression, it often becomes the incurable castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). JC polyomavirus (JCPyV) is a human DNA virus. Its virus-like particles (VLPs) exhibit similar tropism to native virions and they are capable of delivering exogenous genes to the target cells for expression. JCPyV has been detected in prostate cells; therefore, prostate cancer cells may be susceptible to JCPyV infection and JCPyV VLPs may be used as a vector for gene therapy against prostate cancer. Here we constructed a plasmid (pPSAtk) that allows expression of the thymidine kinase suicide gene only in androgen receptor (AR) positive prostate cancer cells using the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) promoter, and used JCPyV VLPs as a vector to carry pPSAtk (PSAtk-VLPs) for transcriptional targeting in prostate cancer cells. In this study, we found that PSAtk-VLPs could only kill AR-positive CRPC 22Rv1 cells in vitro and inhibit the growth of tumor nodules in the xenograft mouse model.

Cox proportional hazards models with 1:1 propensity score-matched analysis were used to investigate the association between ADT use and the risk of autoimmune diseases. The autoimmune diseases included Graves' disease, Crohn's disease, psoriasis, systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, Guillain-Barre syndrome, Sjogren's syndrome, myasthenia gravis, pernicious anemia, hereditary hemolytic anemia, polyarteritis nodosa, Celiac disease, uveitis, polymyalgia rheumatica, dermatomyositis, Hashimoto's thyroiditis, hypersensitivity vasculitis, Behcet's disease, polymyositis, alopecia areata, Wegener's granulomatosis, ulcerative colitis, autoimmune hemolytic anemia, pemphigus, multiple sclerosis, systemic sclerosis, Goodpasture syndrome, giant cell arteritis, thromboangitis obliterans, arteritis obliterans, and Kawasaki disease. The duration of ADT use as a time-dependent variable was also examined for its association with autoimmune diseases. We also performed six secondary analyses.  Results:   Of the 17,168 selected PCa patients, 14,444 patients met all the inclusion and exclusion criteria. After propensity score matching, 5590 ADT users and 5590 non-ADT users were included in the study cohort. A propensity score-matched analysis (adjusted hazard ratio (aHR), 0.619, 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.51-0.75, P < 0.001) demonstrated a significantly decreased risk of autoimmune diseases in ADT users. A significant decrease in the risk of autoimmune diseases with increasing ADT duration was also demonstrated (P < 0.001).

Interpretation:   Targeting ionizing radiation (IR)-increased AR with the AR degradation enhancer, ASC-J9®, could increase the radiosensitivity while sparing adjacent normal tissue. Mechanism dissection revealed that ASC-J9®, but not Enzalutamide, treatment could increase radiosensitivity via inducing DNA damage, altering DNA repair pathways, as well as activating the IR-induced apoptosis via suppressing the pATR-CHK1 signals. Importantly, results from preclinical studies using an in vivo mouse model also demonstrated that combining RT with ASC-J9® to target AR led to better therapeutic efficacy to suppress PCa progression.""","""['Fu-Ju Chou', 'Yuhchyau Chen', 'Dong Chen', 'Yuanjie Niu', 'Gonghui Li', 'Peter Keng', 'Shuyuan Yeh', 'Chawnshang Chang']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""EBioMedicine""","""['Preclinical Study using Malat1 Small Interfering RNA or Androgen Receptor Splicing Variant 7 Degradation Enhancer ASC-J9® to Suppress Enzalutamide-resistant Prostate Cancer Progression.', 'ASC-J9® suppresses prostate cancer cell invasion via altering the sumoylation-phosphorylation of STAT3.', 'Androgen receptor (AR) degradation enhancer ASC-J9® in an FDA-approved formulated solution suppresses castration resistant prostate cancer cell growth.', 'A review of the effects and molecular mechanisms of dimethylcurcumin (ASC-J9) on androgen receptor-related diseases.', 'Stromal androgen receptor roles in the development of normal prostate, benign prostate hyperplasia, and prostate cancer.', 'Advances in molecular targeted therapies to increase efficacy of (chemo)radiation therapy.', 'Targeting the radiation-induced ARv7-mediated circNHS/miR-512-5p/XRCC5 signaling with Quercetin increases prostate cancer radiosensitivity.', 'Biological roles and clinical significance of estrogen and androgen receptors in head and neck cancers.', 'Anti-Androgen Receptor Therapies in Prostate Cancer: A Brief Update and Perspective.', 'Abiraterone In Vitro Is Superior to Enzalutamide in Response to Ionizing Radiation.']"""

Aim:   To present a novel surgical concept of suprapubic fat pad excision with a concomitant placement of inflatable penile prosthesis.  Methods:   A transverse incision begins slightly medial to the anterior superior iliac spine, with the superior edge crossing transversely to the contralateral anterior superior iliac spine. The inferior border is incised in a curvilinear fashion, with the medial apex being approximately 1 cm above the base of the penis. Dissection is carried down to the lower abdominal anterior fascia, which leads to excision of the suprapubic fat pad. Using this same exposure, the inflatable penile prosthesis (IPP) is placed via an infrapubic approach. The wound is reapproximated in multiple layers, and 2 drains are placed, 1 subcutaneous in the area of the fat pad excision and the other in the scrotum around the pump.  Main outcome measures:   Primary outcomes included penile implant functionality, ability to engage in sexual activity, and cosmetic satisfaction.  Results:   A total of 8 patients have undergone suprapubic fat pad excision with simultaneous placement of IPP at our institution. Average body mass index of our patient cohort was 36.6. 1 patient developed prosthetic infection after inadvertent removal of his drains in the immediate postoperative period. At last follow-up, all other patients have excellent cosmetic and functional outcomes.  Clinical implications:   This technique can lead to higher patient satisfaction with their penile implant, enhanced sexual performance, and improved quality of life for patients with concurrent erectile dysfunction and significant suprapubic fat pad.  Strengths & limitations:   This unique technique has never been previously described. It allows placement of IPP in the setting of fat pad excision without any additional incisions. Limitations include the small patient population and relatively short follow-up.  Conclusions:   Suprapubic fat pad excision is a safe and reproducible technique that can be performed simultaneously with the placement of an IPP in appropriately selected patients. Patients must be counseled appropriately on the expectations of surgeries and the theoretical increased risk of postoperative complications, such as infection.

There are other magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) parameters that might be linked to continence outcome.  Objective:   To evaluate the association between preoperative urethral parameters on MRI and continence outcome, to estimate the risk of incontinence using different cut-off values, and to assess interobserver variability in measuring urethral parameters.  Design, setting, and participants:   Patients with localised prostate cancer who underwent RARP were retrospectively reviewed. Baseline patient characteristics, perioperative, and pathological outcomes were assessed. Continence was defined as no pad or a safety pad with <2g/24h pad weight.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Several MRI variables were measured by a uroradiologist, a uro-oncology fellow, and a urologist. Binary logistic regression analyses were performed to identify predictors of incontinence. Interclass correlation was used to evaluate interobserver variability.  Results and limitations:   A total of 190 patients met the study inclusion criteria. The mean MUL was 14.6mm. Age and MUL were significantly associated with incontinence outcome. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for continence based on MUL was 0.78 at 12 mo. The risk of incontinence in patients with MUL of <10mm was 27.8% (13.8% and 39.1% for patients aged <65 and >65 yr respectively). Conversely, the risk of incontinence with MUL >15mm was 2.7% (1.5% and 4.5% for patients aged <65 and >65 yr, respectively). The concordance rate between different observers was 89% for coronal MUL, but 77%, 74%, and 62% for sagittal MUL, membranous urethral thickness, and intraprostatic urethral length, respectively.  Conclusions:   This study confirmed the significance of MUL for the continence outcome following RARP. There was also excellent consistency in measuring MUL values between different observers.  Patient summary:   Although further studies would be required to verify our findings, we support the significance of membranous urethral length in predicting the risk of incontinence and the need to incorporate it as part of preoperative assessment and counselling. This can reliably be measured by urologists and can further facilitate a patient-tailored approach to radical treatment of prostate cancer.""","""['Lawrence H C Kim', 'Amit Patel', 'Netty Kinsella', 'Mansour T A Sharabiani', 'Derfel Ap Dafydd', 'Declan Cahill']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Eur Urol Focus""","""['Appropriate preoperative membranous urethral length predicts recovery of urinary continence after robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy.', 'Integrity of the Urethral Sphincter Complex, Nerve-sparing, and Long-term Continence Status after Robotic-assisted Radical Prostatectomy.', 'Minimal residual membranous urethral length and membranous urethral length predict poor recovery from incontinence after robot-assisted radical prostatectomy and after open radical prostatectomy.', 'Preoperative Membranous Urethral Length Measurement and Continence Recovery Following Radical Prostatectomy: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.', 'Systematic review and meta-analysis of studies reporting urinary continence recovery after robot-assisted radical prostatectomy.', 'Changes of lower urinary tract function after robot-assisted radical prostatectomy: An urodynamic follow-up within 1 year.', 'Prostate MRI for Improving Personalized Risk Prediction of Incontinence and Surgical Planning: The Role of Membranous Urethral Length Measurements and the Use of 3D Models.', 'Inter-observer variability in male pelvic-floor MRI measurements that might predict post-prostatectomy incontinence.', 'A standardized method to measure the membranous urethral length (MUL) on MRI of the prostate with high inter- and intra-observer agreement.', 'Nightmares in Salvage Robot-assisted Radical Prostatectomy After Primary Radiation Therapy for Prostate Cancer: A Step by Step Tutorial.']"""

Materials and methods:   CT scans were performed on a dual-layer spectral CT. We retrospectively evaluated pulmonary metastases of 130 patients (77 men and 53 women, mean age 63, range 22-87) with primary bone (OS) (osteosarcoma; n = 6), breast (invasive-ductal adenocarcinoma; n = 17), colorectal (CRC) (adenocarcinoma; n = 27), head and neck (HNC) (squamous cell carcinoma; n = 17), kidney (RCC) (clear-cell renal cell carcinoma; n = 10), lung (adenocarcinoma; n = 12), pancreato-biliary (PBC) (adenocarcinoma; n = 18), prostate (adenocarcinoma; n = 5), soft tissue (undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma; n = 6), skin (malignant melanoma; n = 6), and urinary tract (transitional-cell carcinoma; n = 6) malignancies. Quantitative IC and conventional CT numbers (HU) were extracted and normalized to the thoracic aorta. Differences between the groups were assessed by pairwise t-tests with Holm-Sidak post-hoc p-value adjustment for multiple comparisons. Diagnostic accuracy was evaluated by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis.  Results:   Significant differences in IC and HU were noted for pulmonary metastases from RCC (IC: 2.83 mg/ml; HU: 93.12) versus breast cancer (IC: 1.47 mg/ml, adjusted p < 0.05; HU: 59.57, adjusted p < 0.05), CRC (IC: 1.23 mg/ml, adjusted p < 0.001; HU: 49.82, adjusted p < 0.001) and HNC (IC: 1.54 mg/ml, adjusted p < 0.05; HU: 58.91, adjusted p < 0.01). Based on IC alone, significant differences were further observed between metastatic lesions from CRC versus OS (IC: 2.36 mg/ml, adjusted p < 0.001), PBC (IC: 2.16 mg/ml, adjusted p < 0.001) and urinary tract carcinoma (IC: 2.21 mg/ml, adjusted p < 0.05). Based on IC and HU, pulmonary metastases from OS, HNC and RCC may be differentiated from other pulmonary metastases (area under ROC curve, 0.69-0.79). The diagnostic accuracy to discriminate between pulmonary metastases from PBC and those from other malignancies was significantly higher based on IC as compared to HU (area under ROC curve, 0.66; p < 0.05); no significant differences in diagnostic accuracy were noted for other differentiations.

Benefitting from the rapid growth both in the availability of miRNA-related data and the development of various analysis methodologies, up until recently, some computational models have been developed to predict human disease related miRNAs, efficiently and quickly.  Results:   In this work, we proposed a computational model of Random Walk and Binary Regression-based MiRNA-Disease Association prediction (RWBRMDA). RWBRMDA extracted features for each miRNA from random walk with restart on the integrated miRNA similarity network for binary logistic regression to predict potential miRNA-disease associations. RWBRMDA obtained AUC of 0.8076 in the leave-one-out cross validation. Additionally, we carried out three different patterns of case studies on four human complex diseases. Specifically, Esophageal cancer and Prostate cancer were conducted as one kind of case study based on known miRNA-disease associations in HMDD v2.0 database. Out of the top 50 predicted miRNAs, 94 and 90% were respectively confirmed by recent experimental reports. To simulate new disease without known related miRNAs, the information of known Breast cancer related miRNAs was removed. As a result, 98% of the top 50 predicted miRNAs for Breast cancer were confirmed. Lymphoma, the verified ratio of which was 88%, was used to assess the prediction robustness of RWBRMDA based on the association records in HMDD v1.0 database.

Hypoxia inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α), the core element in generating the hypoxia response, induces invasion and metastasis by promoting epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). This study explored the underlying mechanism of hypoxia associated with the invasion and metastasis of gastric cancer (GC).  Methods:   Six methods were employed to assess the function of the long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) prostate cancer gene expression marker 1 (PCGEM1) including gene silencing, RT-PCR, the separation of nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions, scrape motility assay, transwell migration assay, and Western-blot.  Results:   LncRNA PCGEM1 was overexpressed in GC cells and tissues, and was induced by hypoxia in GC cells. Additional experiments confirmed that the knockdown of PCGEM1 significantly repressed the invasion and metastasis of GC cells. SNAI1, a key transcription factor of EMT, was regulated by PCGEM1. Overexpression of SNAI1 rescued the inhibition of PCGEM1-knockdown during the invasion and metastasis of GC cells. In addition, PCGEM1 and SNAI1 jointly affected the biomarkers of EMT.  Conclusion:   Our findings indicated that PCGEM1 is a hypoxia-responsive lncRNA, and contributes to the invasion and metastasis of GC.

Consistently, GBA and TRAIL induced cleavages of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), caspase-9 and caspase-8 along with upregulation of death receptor 5 (DR5) and also attenuated the expression of B-cell lymphoma-extra-large (Bcl-xL), B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2), X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP) in H460/R cells. Furthermore, combination of GBA and TRAIL remarkably inhibited the expression of decoy receptor 1 (DcR1) and multidrug resistance 1(MDR1) in H460/R cells. Consistently, GBA and TRAIL effectively maintained Rhodamine 123 accumulation in H460/R cells compared to GBA or TRAIL alone by blocking multidrug efflux pump from the cells.

Here we extend to survival outcomes a method for multiple mediation analysis based on the computation of appropriate weights. The approach considered has the advantages of not requiring specific models for mediators, allowing nonindependent mediators of any nature, and not relying on the assumption of rare outcomes. Simulation studies show good performance of the proposed estimator in terms of bias and coverage probability. The method is further applied to an example from a published study on prostate cancer mortality aimed at understanding the extent to which the effect of DNA methyltransferase 3b (DNMT3b) genotype on mortality was explained by DNA methylation and tumor aggressiveness.

Currently, little is known about its physiological function and involvement in diseases, including cancer. A comprehensive analysis of 8887 gene expression profiles in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) revealed that MAPK4 overexpression correlates with decreased overall survival, with particularly marked survival effects in patients with lung adenocarcinoma, bladder cancer, low-grade glioma, and thyroid carcinoma. Interestingly, human tumor MAPK4 overexpression also correlated with phosphorylation of AKT, 4E-BP1, and p70S6K, independent of the loss of PTEN or mutation of PIK3CA. This led us to examine whether MAPK4 activates the key metabolic, prosurvival, and proliferative kinase AKT and mTORC1 signaling, independent of the canonical PI3K pathway. We found that MAPK4 activated AKT via a novel, concerted mechanism independent of PI3K. Mechanistically, MAPK4 directly bound and activated AKT by phosphorylation of the activation loop at threonine 308. It also activated mTORC2 to phosphorylate AKT at serine 473 for full activation. MAPK4 overexpression induced oncogenic outcomes, including transforming prostate epithelial cells into anchorage-independent growth, and MAPK4 knockdown inhibited cancer cell proliferation, anchorage-independent growth, and xenograft growth. We concluded that MAPK4 can promote cancer by activating the AKT/mTOR signaling pathway and that targeting MAPK4 may provide a novel therapeutic approach for cancer.""","""['Wei Wang', 'Tao Shen', 'Bingning Dong', 'Chad J Creighton', 'Yanling Meng', 'Wolong Zhou', 'Qing Shi', 'Hao Zhou', 'Yinjie Zhang', 'David D Moore', 'Feng Yang']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""J Clin Invest""","""['MAPK4 promotes prostate cancer by concerted activation of androgen receptor and AKT.', 'MAPK4 promotes triple negative breast cancer growth and reduces tumor sensitivity to PI3K blockade.', 'A comprehensive immunohistochemical and molecular approach to the PI3K/AKT/mTOR (phosphoinositide 3-kinase/v-akt murine thymoma viral oncogene/mammalian target of rapamycin) pathway in bladder urothelial carcinoma.', 'RES-529: a PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway inhibitor that dissociates the mTORC1 and mTORC2 complexes.', 'Targeting the translational apparatus to improve leukemia therapy: roles of the PI3K/PTEN/Akt/mTOR pathway.', 'A Pilot Genome-Wide Association Study Identifies Novel Markers of Metabolic Syndrome in Patients with Psoriasis.', 'Cooperative activation of PDK1 and AKT by MAPK4 enhances cancer growth and resistance to therapy.', 'ERK3 and DGKζ interact to modulate cell motility in lung cancer cells.', 'UBXN2A suppresses the Rictor-mTORC2 signaling pathway, an established tumorigenic pathway in human colorectal cancer.', 'Potential role of LPAR5 gene in prognosis and immunity of thyroid papillary carcinoma and pan-cancer.']"""

Metformin was added to abiraterone continuously at 1000 mg twice daily in uninterrupted 4-week cycles. The primary end point was the absence of disease progression at 12 weeks (PFS12). The Fleming single-stage design was applied. With a 5% significance level and 80% power, 25 patients were required to test PFS12 ≤ 15% (H0) compared to ≥ 35% (H1). Secondary end points included toxicity and safety issues. The study was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01677897).  Results:   The primary end point PFS12 was 12% (3 of 25 patients) (95% confidence interval, 3-31).

A number of therapeutic approaches are available for cancer treatment, including surgery, radiation, and other strategies, some of which have been awarded previous Nobel Prizes. These include methods for hormone treatment for prostate cancer (Huggins, 1966), chemotherapy (Elion and Hitchins, 1988), and bone marrow transplantation for leukemia (Thomas, 1990). Many scientists engaged in intense basic research and uncovered fundamental mechanisms regulating immunity and also showed how the immune system can recognize cancer cells. T-cells were shown to have receptors that bind to structures recognized as non-self and such interactions trigger the immune system to engage in defense. However, additional proteins acting as T-cell accelerators are also required to trigger a full-blown immune response. Many scientists contributed to this important basic research and identified other proteins that function as brakes on the T-cells, inhibiting immune activation. This intricate balance between the accelerators and inhibitors is essential for a tight control. New strategy was developed into a therapy for humans. Promising results soon emerged from several groups, and in 2010 an important clinical study showed striking effects in patients with advanced melanoma. In several patients, signs of remaining cancer disappeared. The results were dramatic, leading to long-term remission and possible cure in several patients with metastatic cancer, a condition that had previously been considered essentially untreatable.

A novel magnetic retractor system (Levita Magnetic Surgical System, San Mateo, CA) was recently approved by the Food and Drug Administration for use in minimally invasive surgery.  Objective:   To evaluate the safety and efficacy of magnetic-assisted robotic surgery (MARS) to perform a reduced-port radical prostatectomy (RP).  Materials:   Sixteen patients underwent a MARS reduced-port RP in the treatment of prostatic adenocarcinoma at a single institution from June 2018 to September 2018 utilizing the magnetic retraction device in lieu of the 4th robotic arm for tissue retraction. All surgical procedures were completed using the da Vinci surgical system (Intuitive Surgical Inc., Sunnyvale, CA). The magnetic retractor was used to manipulate and retract the colon, peritoneum, seminal vesicles, prostatic capsule during neurovascular bundle dissection, and bladder during lymphadenectomy.  Results:   All cases were successfully completed without placement of a 4th robotic arm or an additional assistant port. The magnetic retractor subjectively provided comparable retraction and exposure to these tools. No intraoperative or immediate postoperative complications were noted. Mean operative time was 236 ± 23 minutes and mean blood loss was 265 ± 88 mL. All patients were discharged to home by postoperative day 2.  Conclusion:   Magnetic-assisted reduced-port robotic prostatectomy is a novel technique that appears to be both safe and effective.

Objective:   To investigate adherence of patients with PCa to healthy lifestyle recommendations from the World Cancer Research Fund (WCRF) and the American Institute for Cancer Research (AICR).  Design, setting, and participants:   A total of 2227 men with PCa scheduled for radical prostatectomy in the Martini-Klinik at the University Hospital Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany between January 2016 and December 2017.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Age and clinical characteristics were collected at the time of the diagnosis. Assessment of diet and physical activity data were obtained via e-mail surveys using validated questionnaires developed for the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) study [food frequency questionnaire, version 2 (FFQ2), EPIC-Physical Activity Questionnaire (EPIC-PAQ)]. Baseline characteristics were calculated as means and standard deviations for continuous data or counts and percentages for categorical data.  Results and limitations:   Patients followed 3.3 (±1.5) of the 10 WCRF/AICR recommendations. None of the participants reached all goals; 67.3% of the patients did not fulfill the criteria of a healthy normal weight, 33.5% reported no exercise at all, and 49.6% were characterized as current or ex-smokers. As to nutritional goals, 75.4% did not meet the recommended intake of meat, 88.8% reported a low consumption of fruit and vegetables, and 86% did not achieve the recommended fiber intake. Because these analyses are based on self-reported data of diet and lifestyle, a bias toward underreporting cannot be excluded.  Conclusions:   First results of the MARTINI-Lifestyle cohort show that adherence to the AICR/WCRF recommendations for cancer prevention is poor.  Patient summary:   Patients with prostate cancer scheduled for surgery do not adhere to cancer prevention guidelines. Thus, improving lifestyle habits may provide significant impact on patient health and quality of life.""","""['Imke Thederan', 'Thenappan Chandrasekar', 'Pierre Tennstedt', 'Laura Kuehl', 'Christina Sorbe', 'Derya Tilki', 'Matthias Augustin', 'Hans Heinzer', 'Birgit-Christiane Zyriax']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Eur Urol Focus""","""['Adherence to the World Cancer Research Fund/American Institute for Cancer Research guidelines and risk of death in Europe: results from the European Prospective Investigation into Nutrition and Cancer cohort study1,4.', 'Dietary and Physical Activity Changes and Adherence to WCRF/AICR Cancer Prevention Recommendations following a Remotely Delivered Weight Loss Intervention for Female Breast Cancer Survivors: The Living Well after Breast Cancer Randomized Controlled Trial.', ""Colorectal cancers survivors' adherence to lifestyle recommendations and cross-sectional associations with health-related quality of life."", 'Adherence to the WCRF/AICR Dietary Recommendations for Cancer Prevention and Risk of Cancer in Elderly from Europe and the United States: A Meta-Analysis within the CHANCES Project.', 'Fruits and vegetables: updating the epidemiologic evidence for the WCRF/AICR lifestyle recommendations for cancer prevention.', 'Recommendations on Weight Loss and Healthy Lifestyle in Prostate Cancer Clinical Guidelines: A Systematic Review.', 'Compliance, adherence and effectiveness of a community-based pre-operative exercise programme: a pilot study.']"""

However, the role of miR-515-5p in prostate cancer was still unclear. In this study, we observed miR-515-5p expression was reduced in prostate cancer tissues and prostate cancer cell lines compared with paired adjacent normal prostatic tissues and normal human prostate epithelial cell lines, respectively. Furthermore, we found miR-515-5p was negatively correlated with TRIP13 mRNA and protein expression in prostate cancer tissue samples, and miR-515-5p directly targeted TRIP13 3'-UTR and negatively regulated TRIP13 mRNA and protein expression. Moreover, miR-515-5p acted as a tumor suppressor to regulate cell proliferation, migration and invasion via targeting TRIP13 in prostate cancer. Besides, we observed that miR-515-5p expression in prostate cancer patients with advanced T stage subgroup or high Gleason score was significantly lower than its expression in prostate cancer patients with early T stage or low Gleason score. Survival analysis suggested that prostate cancer cases with high miR-515-5p expression had better prognosis than prostate cancer cases with low miR-515-5p expression.

This study evaluated the effects of whole grain/bran rye consumption on low-grade inflammation and endothelial function biomarkers in men with prostate cancer.  Methods:   Seventeen men with untreated, low-grade prostate cancer consumed 485 g rye whole grain and bran products (RP) per day or refined wheat products with added cellulose (WP) in a randomized crossover design. Fasting blood samples were taken before and after 2, 4, and 6 weeks of treatment.  Results:   Concentrations of tumor nuclear factor-receptor 2 (TNF-R2), e-selectin, and endostatin were significantly lower after consumption of the RP diet compared with WP (p < 0.05). Cathepsin S concentration was positively correlated to TNF-R2 and endostatin concentrations across all occasions. Strong correlations were consistently found between intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) and between interleukin-6 (IL-6) and interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1RA). No effect of intervention was found in 92 inflammation-related protein biomarkers measured in a proximity extension assay.  Conclusions:   RP diet lowered TNF-R2, e-selectin, and endostatin, compared with WP in men with prostate cancer.

Approximately 20% of primary prostate tumors are invisible to mpMRI, and we hypothesize that this invisibility reflects fundamental molecular properties of the tumor. We therefore profiled the genomes and transcriptomes of 40 International Society of Urological Pathology grade 2 tumors: 20 mpMRI-invisible (Prostate Imaging-Reporting and Data System [PI-RADS] v2 <3) and 20 mpMRI-visible (PI-RADS v2 5) tumors. mpMRI-visible tumors were enriched in hallmarks of nimbosus, an aggressive pathological, molecular, and microenvironmental phenomenon in prostate cancer. These hallmarks included genomes with increased mutation density, a higher prevalence of intraductal carcinoma/cribriform architecture pathology, and altered abundance of 102 transcripts, including overexpression of noncoding RNAs such as SCHLAP1. Multiple small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) were identified, and a snoRNA signature synergized with nimbosus hallmarks to discriminate visible from invisible tumors. These data suggest a confluence of aggressive molecular and microenvironmental phenomena underlie mpMRI visibility of localized prostate cancer.

Brachytherapy by Ir-192 was carried out in 20 patients, in the form of monotherapy 3 fractions in a single focal dose 10 Gy with a two-week interruption between fractions to a total focal dose 30 Gy. Biologically effective dose was 230 Gy. The percentage of the prescribed dose on organ-target (V100) was not less than 95% (average 97.1 %). The critical dose on the urethra and the rectum was 110% and 70% of the prescribed dose respectively. The early and late radiation toxic reactions from genitourinary system and gastrointestinal tract in all of them were marked only as I grade. There were no adverse events of II-IV grades.
