Design, setting and participants:   Population-based cohort study in New South Wales, Australia of prostate cancer survivors aged <70 years at diagnosis and who returned a 10-year follow-up questionnaire.  Methods:   Validated instruments assessed patient's HRQOL and psychological well-being. Poisson regression was used to estimate adjusted relative proportions (RRs) of prostate cancer survivor groups who were currently eating differently ('using diet') or exercise differently ('using exercise') to help with their prostate cancer.  Results:   996 (61.0% of 1634) participants completed the 10-year questionnaire of whom 118 (11.8%; 95%CI[9.8-13.9]) were using diet and 78 (7.8%; 95%CI[6.2-9.5]) were using exercise to help with their prostate cancer. Men were more likely to use diet or use exercise for prostate cancer if they were younger (p-trend = 0.020 for diet, p-trend = 0.045 for exercise), more educated (p-trend<0.001, p-trend = 0.011), support group participants (p-nominal<0.001, p-nominal = 0.005), had higher Gleason score at diagnosis (p-trend<0.001, p-trend = 0.002) and had knowledge of cancer spread (p-nominal = 0.002, p-nominal = 0.001). Use of diet was also associated with receipt of androgen deprivation therapy (RR = 1.59; 95%CI[1.04-2.45]), a greater fear of cancer recurrence (p-trend = 0.010), cognitive avoidance (p-trend = 0.025) and greater perceived control of cancer course (p-trend = 0.014). Use of exercise was also associated with receipt of prostatectomy (RR = 2.02; 95%CI[1.12-3.63]), receipt of androgen deprivation therapy (RR = 2.20; 95%CI[1.34-3.61]) and less satisfaction with medical treatments (p-trend = 0.044).  Conclusions:   Few long-term prostate cancer survivors use diet or exercise to help with their prostate cancer. Survivors may benefit from counselling on the scientific evidence supporting healthy eating and regular exercise for improving quality-of-life and cancer-related outcomes.""","""['Suzanne Hughes', 'Sam Egger', 'Chelsea Carle', 'David P Smith', 'Suzanne Chambers', 'Clare Kahn', 'Cristina M Caperchione', 'Annette Moxey', ""Dianne L O'Connell""]""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Factors associated with the use of complementary and alternative medicines for prostate cancer by long-term survivors.', 'Phase of care prevalence for prostate cancer in New South Wales, Australia: A population-based modelling study.', 'Long-term Psychological and Quality-of-life Effects of Active Surveillance and Watchful Waiting After Diagnosis of Low-risk Localised Prostate Cancer.', 'Health-related quality of life among long-term (≥5\xa0years) prostate cancer survivors by primary intervention: a systematic review.', 'Psychosocial interventions for men with prostate cancer.', ""'Food for Thought'-The Relationship between Diet and Cognition in Breast and Colorectal Cancer Survivors: A Feasibility Study."", 'Barriers and facilitators related to undertaking physical activities among men with prostate cancer: a scoping review.', 'Longitudinal Assessment of Prevalence and Risk Factors of Anxiety and Depression among Prostate Cancer Survivors Post-Resection.', 'Changes in lifestyle among prostate cancer survivors: A nationwide population-based study.']"""

Materials and methods:   We retrospectively analyzed the records of 22,860 patients with prostate cancer treated with luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonists. Analyses were done using 2 definitions of month, including a 28-day month (late dosing after day 28, 84, 112 or 168) and an extended month (late after day 32, 97, 128 or 194) for 1, 3, 4 and 6-month formulations, respectively. The prevalence of late dosing, associated testosterone values, and the frequency of testosterone and prostate specific antigen testing were assessed. Statistical significance was assessed with the unpaired t-test.  Results:   Of the injections 84% and 27% were late for the 28-day and extended month analyses, respectively. For the 28-day month 60% and 29% of injections were late by more than 1 and more than 2 weeks, respectively. Of testosterone values 4% were greater than 50 ng/dl for early/on time injections using both definitions, and 15% and 27% were greater than 50 ng/dl when late, and for the 28-day month and the extended month, respectively. For early/on time vs late injections 22% vs 31% of testosterone values were greater than 20 ng/dl for the 28-day month and 21% vs 43% for the extended month. Mean testosterone was higher when late (49 ng/dl for 28-day month, 79 ng/dl for extended month) vs early/on time (both 21 ng/dl). Of the injections prostate specific antigen measurements were performed in 83% and testosterone assessment was done in only 13%.  Conclusions:   Luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonists were frequently (84%) administered later than the schedules used in pivotal trials. Nearly half of the late testosterone values for the extended month were greater than 20 ng/dl and mean testosterone was almost double the castration level. Elevated testosterone remained unidentified with infrequent testing.""","""['E David Crawford', 'Przemyslaw W Twardowski', 'Raoul S Concepcion', 'Jason M Hafron', 'Richard G Harris', 'Judd W Moul', 'Lucio N Gordan', 'Daniel P Petrylak', 'Stuart N Atkinson', 'Deborah M Boldt-Houle', 'Thomas E Keane', 'Celestia S Higano', 'R Jonathan Henderson', 'A Karim Kader', 'Maha H Hussain', 'Neal D Shore']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""J Urol""","""['Impact of Late Dosing on Testosterone Suppression with 2 Different Leuprolide Acetate Formulations: In Situ Gel and Microsphere.

Methods:   The authors drew a sample of 390 patients in 2005 and 539 patients in 2017 who were diagnosed with breast (128 patients in 2005 and 143 patients in 2017), prostate (96 patients in 2005 and 126 patients in 2017), or gynecologic (89 patients in 2005 and 188 patients in 2017) cancer or lymphoma (77 patients in 2005 and 82 patients in 2017) in 4 different hospitals for the periods 2002 through 2004 and 2014 through 2016. These patients were sent a paper-based questionnaire that contained 45 questions regarding demographics and 4 functions of internet use: content, communication, community, and e-health.  Results:   The response in 2017 (53%) was lower than that in 2005 (75%). Survivors browsed the internet most frequently to search for information regarding cancer shortly after being diagnosed and while waiting for treatment. There was little change noted with regard to the relative importance attached to the various subjects. In 2017, significant increases were evident with regard to finances (+33%), health care insurance (+29%), and genetics and/or heritability (+27%). The wishes expressed in 2005 by patients were realized in part in 2017.  Conclusions:   A significant sample of cancer survivors in the Netherlands have indicated that the internet is an important source of information regarding their illness. However, little change was evident over the past 15 years with regard to patients' priorities regarding their wishes for internet use. The wishes of users in 2005 were found to accurately reflect the internet use of the majority of patients in 2017. The results of the current study support the belief that health care professionals should expand their online services and tailor them toward the needs and wishes of their patients.""","""['Mies C H J van Eenbergen', 'Ruben D Vromans', 'Dorry Boll', 'Paul J M Kil', 'Caroline M Vos', 'Emiel J Krahmer', 'Floortje Mols', 'Lonneke V van de Poll-Franse']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Cancer""","""['Comparing Survivors of Cancer in Population-Based Samples With Those in Online Cancer Communities: Cross-sectional Questionnaire Study.', 'Internet use by cancer survivors: current use and future wishes.', 'Patterns of Internet-based health information seeking in adult survivors of childhood cancer.', 'The role of posttraumatic stress and posttraumatic growth on online information use in breast cancer survivors.', 'Internet use after prostate cancer : Search for information and trust in disease-related information in long-term survivors.', 'Addressing privacy concerns for mobile and wearable devices sensors: Small-group interviews with healthy adults and cancer survivors.', ""AYAs' online information and eHealth needs: A comparison with healthcare professionals' perceptions."", 'Comparing Survivors of Cancer in Population-Based Samples With Those in Online Cancer Communities: Cross-sectional Questionnaire Study.', 'Current Status of Out-of-Hospital Management of Cancer Patients and Awareness of Internet Medical Treatment: A Questionnaire Survey.', 'Differences in Internet Use and eHealth Needs of Adolescent and Young Adult Versus Older Cancer Patients; Results from the PROFILES Registry.']"""

The malignancy usually presents with metastasis and poor prognosis, and causes 100% mortality. Therefore, the treatment of CRPC is extremely challenging, and its pathogenesis need to be elucidated urgently.  Objective:   The high throughput sequencing technology was used to sequence the whole exome associated with CRPC, to explore the molecular mechanism of CRPC, and to find the potential therapeutic targets.  Methods:   We performed whole-exome sequencing of FFPE tissue from 11 Chinese adult male patients. Genomic DNA was fragmented and enriched for whole-exome sequencing using the QiAamp DNA FFPE Tissue KIT, sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq2000 platform, and the relevant genes were analyzed using biological information. Finally, immunohistochemistry method was used to detect the phosphorylation level of LATS1 in CRPC tissues of MST1 mutant and non-mutant patients.  Results:   We have screened 85 significant mutant genes with relatively high mutation rates of TP53, AR, KMT2, DMAPK1, PIK3R1, SH2B3, WHSC1, KMT2D, MST1 and MAPK1. We first found that MST1 has multiple mutations in CRPC patients, and the MST1 plays an important role in the Hippo pathway. Immunohistochemistry results showed that the phosphorylation level of LATS1 in the mutant patients was significantly lower than that in the non-mutant patients.  Conclusion:   We speculate that MST1 would be a new potential target for the treatment of CRPC by regulating Hippo signaling pathway. The results provided an important clue to the molecular mechanism of CRPC.""","""['Lifang Hao', 'Hui Li', 'Su Zhang', 'Yanlei Yang', 'Zhenzhen Xu', 'Yanfen Zhang', 'Zhongcheng Liu']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Curr Pharm Biotechnol""","""['Expression of phosphorylated Hippo pathway kinases (MST1/2 and LATS1/2) in HER2-positive and triple-negative breast cancer patients treated with neoadjuvant therapy.', 'Somatic copy number alterations by whole-exome sequencing implicates YWHAZ and PTK2 in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'PROTAC-induced BET protein degradation as a therapy for castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Androgen receptor: what we know and what we expect in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Androgen receptor co-regulatory networks in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Effect of taurine on the proliferation, apoptosis and MST1/Hippo signaling in prostate cancer cells.', ""Targeting the Hippo Pathway in Prostate Cancer: What's New?""]"""

Despite these patients' poor prognosis, accurate estimation of their overall survival (OS) is essential to determine whether benefits exist from the treatment and whether the loss of valuable time and unnecessary side effects can be avoided. The aim of the present study is to evaluate whether various biochemical markers can predict OS in men undergoing PSMA-RLT and whether the changes assessed after PSMA-RLT correlate with the OS.  Methods:   The tested tumor markers in this retrospective analysis were alkaline phosphatase (ALP), bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BAP), prostate-specific antigen (PSA), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), chromogranin A, and pro-gastrin-releasing peptide (pro-GRP). For the evaluation, we performed blood tests before each PSMA-RLT cycle and during follow-up visits (which were 2-3 months apart). All patients were followed up until their deaths. To test the correlations between the tumor markers and survival, we conducted the logrank tests and the multivariate Cox proportional-hazards regression model. The significance level was set at P < .05.  Results:   The study included 137 patients who received a total of 487 PSMA-RLT cycles between January 2015 and November 2017. Of the tested biochemical tumor markers, baseline ALP (120 U/L cut-off), LDH (248 U/L cut-off), and PSA (first quartile cut-off) correlated significantly with survival post-PSMA-RLT (P < .001 for ALP and LDH, and P = .007 for PSA). Stable and/or decreased values in most of the initially abnormal parameters were associated with significantly better OS; these parameters were ALP (P = .009), LDH (P = .005), PSA (P < .001), and pro-GRP (P = .013). The BAP and ALP responses also correlated significantly with survival in patients with bone metastases (P = .002 and P < .001, respectively). Furthermore, there was a strong correlation of the kinetic patterns of PSA, ALP, BAP, and LDH with the survival, showing that patients with steadily increasing markers had the shortest OS.  Conclusion:   Along with the established tumor marker PSA, ALP, LDH, BAP, and pro-GRP were correlated with the OS post-PSMA-RLT in the univariate and multivariate analyses.""","""['Anna Yordanova', 'Paula Linden', 'Stefan Hauser', 'Georg Feldmann', 'Peter Brossart', 'Rolf Fimmers', 'Markus Essler', 'Stefan Holdenrieder', 'Hojjat Ahmadzadehfar']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['PSMA targeted radioligandtherapy in metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer after chemotherapy, abiraterone and/or enzalutamide.

The HNTs/siRNA complex increased the serum stability of the siRNA, increased its circulation lifetime in blood, and promoted the cellular uptake and tumor accumulation of the siRNA. The siRNA markedly down-regulated RIPK4 expression in bladder cancer cells and bladder tumors, thus inhibiting tumorigenesis and progression in three bladder tumor models (a subcutaneous model, an in situ bladder tumor model, and a lung metastasis model), with no adverse effects.

The aim of the present study was to determine potential diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for PCa. The GSE103512 dataset was downloaded, and the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were screened. Gene Ontology (GO), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) and protein-protein interaction (PPI) analyses of DEGs were performed. The result of GO analysis suggested that the DEGs were mostly enriched in 'carboxylic acid catabolic process', 'cell apoptosis', 'cell proliferation' and 'cell migration'. KEGG analysis results indicated that the DEGs were mostly concentrated in 'metabolic pathways', 'ECM-receptor interaction', the 'PI3K-Akt pathway' and 'focal adhesion'. The PPI analysis results showed that Golgi membrane protein 1 (GOLM1), melanoma inhibitory activity member 3 (MIA3), ATP citrate lyase (ACLY) and G protein subunit β2 (GNB2) were the key genes in PCa, and the Module analysis revealed that they were associated with 'ECM-receptor interaction', 'focal adhesion', the 'PI3K-Akt pathway' and the 'metabolic pathway'. Subsequently, the gene expression was confirmed using Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis and the Human Protein Atlas. The results demonstrated that GOLM1 and ACLY expression was significantly upregulated (P<0.05) in PCa compared with that in normal tissues. Receiver operating characteristic and survival analyses were performed. The results showed that area under the curve values of these genes all exceeded 0.85, and high expression of these genes was associated with poor survival in patients with PCa. In conclusion, this study identified GOLM1 and ACLY in PCa, which may be potential diagnostic and prognostic biomarker of PCa.""","""['Qiang Zhang', 'Xiujuan Yin', 'Zhiwei Pan', 'Yingying Cao', 'Shaojie Han', 'Guojun Gao', 'Zhiqin Gao', 'Zhifang Pan', 'Weiguo Feng']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Oncol Lett""","""['Identification of key genes and associated pathways in KIT/PDGFRA wild‑type gastrointestinal stromal tumors through bioinformatics analysis.', 'Identification of differentially expressed genes, associated functional terms pathways, and candidate diagnostic biomarkers in inflammatory bowel diseases by bioinformatics analysis.', 'Identification of key genes and pathways in meningioma by bioinformatics analysis.', 'Identification of potential key genes in gastric cancer using bioinformatics analysis.', 'PODN is a prognostic biomarker and correlated with immune infiltrates in osteosarcoma.', 'GBAP1 functions as a tumor promotor in hepatocellular carcinoma via the PI3K/AKT pathway.', 'Acetyl-CoA Counteracts the Inhibitory Effect of Antiandrogens on Androgen Receptor Signaling in Prostate Cancer Cells.', 'ZNF507 affects TGF-β signaling via TGFBR1 and MAP3K8 activation in the progression of prostate cancer to an aggressive state.', 'A novel metabolic function of Myc in regulation of fatty acid synthesis in prostate cancer.']"""

The objective of this article is to present the role of clinical neurophysiology in Urology in the identification and preservation, on the one hand, of the prostate neurovascular bundles in radical prostatectomy (RP), and of the pudendal nerve in the release of this in Pudendal Nerve Entrapment Syndrome (PNS).  Methods:   A bipolar laparoscopic probe was used for intraoperative stimulation for both the identification in PNS and neurovascular bundles in RP, obtaining response at the external anal sphincter in the first one; and intracavernous pressure in the second through needle electrodes.  Results:   Preservation of the periprostatic neurovascular bundles allows to increase rates of sexual potency and urinary continence after surgery. However, it has been shown that the innervation of the corpora cavernosa and the urinary sphincter has a variable disposition. Intraoperative neurostimulation allows the most precise identification and dissection of the vascular and nervous structures that surround the prostate. In the diagnosis of PNS, the neurophysiological study allows to rule out pathology at other levels, such as, primary muscular pathology of the anal sphincter. There are no pathognomonic neurophysiological findings of PNS.

After laparoscop ic removal of sentinel nodes all patients underwent an ePLND.  Results:   SPECT-CT showed radiotracer deposits outside the territory of the ePLND in 76% of patients and laparoscopic gamma probe in 57%. The median number of sentinel nodes removed was 5.2 with a total average number of lymph nodes removed of 22. In all cases with metastatic nodes (28% in the series) there was at least one positive sentinel node but metastatic sentinel nodes outside of the territory of the ePLND were found in 6/24 patients (25%). The sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV of 99mTc were 100%, 96.07%, 90.47% and 100%, respectively. In 5 out of 14 patients with mixed radiotracer, lymph node involvement was detected.

However, mpMRI has some limitations such as variability, long learning curve and high cost. More progress is needed in the PCa diagnosis scenario, and it is here where high resolution micro-ultrasound (MUS) imaging system emerge.  Material and methods:   Retrospective study between February (2017-2018); including 96 patients with PCa suspicion, undergoing transrectal prostate biopsy guided by MUS. Procedure was performed by 2 urologists blinded to mpMRI results at first (92% available). PRI-MUS protocol was used to identify suspicious features. 2 core targeted biopsy of suspicious areas (PRIMUS >3) was completed first and then it was followed by a 12-core systematic biopsy and finally sampling of mpMRI targets if available. Data were collected reporting sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) to detect clinically significant PCa (csPCa) (Gleason score >7).  Results:   Overall, MUS csPCa detection rate was 59.37%. 171 cores were registered, of them csPCa were distributed as follow: 1.2% PRI-MUS 1, 16.3% PRIMUS 2, 28% PRI-MUS 3, 39% PRI-MUS 4 and 15% PRI-MUS 5.

Currently, there are no Ab therapeutics targeting VEGFR2 approved for the treatment of prostate cancer or leukemia. Therefore, development of novel efficacious anti-VEGFR2 Abs will benefit cancer patients. We used the Institute of Cellular and Organismic Biology human Ab library and affinity maturation to develop a fully human Ab, anti-VEGFR2-AF, which shows excellent VEGFR2 binding activity. Anti-VEGFR2-AF bound Ig-like domain 3 of VEGFR2 extracellular region to disrupt the interaction between VEGF-A and VEGFR2, neutralizing downstream signaling of the receptor. Moreover, anti-VEGFR2-AF inhibited capillary structure formation and exerted Ab-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity and complement-dependent cytotoxicity in vitro. We found that VEGFR2 is expressed in PC-3 human prostate cancer cell line and associated with malignancy and metastasis of human prostate cancer. In a PC-3 xenograft mouse model, treatment with anti-VEGFR2-AF repressed tumor growth and angiogenesis as effectively and safely as US FDA-approved anti-VEGFR2 therapeutic, ramucirumab. We also report for the first time that addition of anti-VEGFR2 Ab can enhance the efficacy of docetaxel in the treatment of a prostate cancer mouse model. In HL-60 human leukemia-xenografted mice, anti-VEGFR2-AF showed better efficacy than ramucirumab with prolonged survival and reduced metastasis of leukemia cells to ovaries and lymph nodes.

After treatment with androgen‑deprivation therapy (ADT), the majority of patients develop castration‑resistant prostate cancer within months or years. In order to investigate potential novel therapeutic targets in addition to ADT, the present study examined the regulatory mechanisms of the AR signaling pathway. In the present study, LNCaP cells were metabolically‑labeled with Alk‑C16, a palmitate probe. In addition, cells were treated with R1881, an androgen, or DMSO. Subsequently, click‑chemistry‑based palmitoylome profiling was performed in LNCaP cells and palmitoylated proteins were compared between cells treated with androgen and untreated cells. Androgen treatment was revealed to significantly increase the palmitoylation level of α‑tubulin. In addition, the palmitoylation level of Ras‑related protein Rab‑7a (Rab7a) was enhanced by androgen treatment. Palmitoylation of α‑tubulin and Rab7a were essential for cell proliferation. Notably, in the supernatant of LNCaP cells, the palmitoylation level of α‑tubulin was also increased following androgen treatment. Palmitoylation of α‑tubulin may provide a new potential target for the treatment of prostate cancer.

We aimed to assess health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in TITAN, including pain and fatigue.  Methods:   In this randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind, phase 3 study, patients with metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer (defined as not receiving ADT at the time of metastatic disease progression) aged 18 years and older, receiving continuous ADT (selected at the investigator's discretion), and with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status score of 0 or 1 were randomly assigned (1:1), using an interactive web response system, to receive oral apalutamide (four 60 mg tablets, once daily) or matching placebo. Previous localised disease treatment or previous docetaxel for metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer were allowed. Randomisation was stratified by Gleason score at diagnosis, region, and previous docetaxel treatment. Randomisation was done using randomly permuted blocks (block size of four). Investigators, research staff, sponsor study team, and patients were masked to the identities of test and control treatments. Patient-reported outcomes were prespecified exploratory endpoints and were the Brief Pain Inventory-Short Form (BPI-SF), Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI), Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Prostate (FACT-P), and EuroQoL 5D questionnaire 5 level (EQ-5D-5L). BPI and BFI were completed for 7 consecutive days (days -6 to 1 inclusive of each cycle visit), then at months 4, 8, and 12 in follow-up. FACT-P and EQ-5D-5L were completed during cycles 1-7, then every other cycle until the end of treatment, and at months 4, 8, and 12 in follow-up. Analyses were based on the intention-to-treat population. Missing patient-reported outcome assessments were calculated as the expected number of assessments for a visit minus the actual number of assessments received for that visit. For time-to-event endpoints, when median values could not be calculated because less than 50% of patients had degradation, 25th percentiles were compared. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02489318, and is ongoing.  Findings:   Between Dec 9, 2015, and July 25, 2017, 1052 eligible patients were enrolled randomly assigned to apalutamide (n=525) or placebo (n=527). Data cutoff for this analysis of patient-reported outcomes was Nov 23, 2018. Median follow-up for time to pain-related endpoints ranged from 19·4 to 22·1 months. Patients were mostly asymptomatic at baseline: on the BPI-SF pain severity scale of 0-10, median pain scores (indicating worst pain in the past 24 h) were 1·14 (IQR 0-3·17) in the apalutamide group and 1·00 (0-2·86) in the placebo group, and median worst fatigue scores on the BFI were 1·29 (IQR 0-3·29) in the apalutamide group and 1·43 (0·14-3·14) in the placebo group. Patient experience of pain and fatigue (intensity and interference) did not differ between the groups for the duration of treatment. Median time to worst pain intensity progression was 19·09 months (95% CI 11·04-not reached) in the apalutamide group versus 11·99 months (8·28-18·46) in the placebo group (HR 0·89 [95% CI 0·75-1·06]; p=0·20). Median time to pain interference progression was not reached in either group (95% CI 28·58-not reached in the apalutamide group; not reached-not reached in the placebo group). 25th percentiles for time to pain interference progression were 9·17 months (5·55-11·96) in the apalutamide group and 6·24 months (4·63-7·43) in the placebo group (HR 0·90 [95% CI 0·73-1·10]; p=0·29). FACT-P total scores and EQ-5D-5L data showed preservation of HRQOL in both groups. The median time to deterioration as determined by FACT-P total score was 8·87 months (95% CI 4·70-11·10) in the apalutamide group and 9·23 months (7·39-12·91) in the placebo group (HR 1·02 [95% CI 0·85-1·22]; p=0·85).  Interpretation:   Apalutamide with ADT is a well-tolerated and effective option for men with metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer.

SWCNT-Cur significantly increased the blood concentration of curcumin, up to 18-fold, in mice. And in a murine S180 tumor model, SWCNT-Cur exhibited significantly higher inhibition efficacy on tumor growth and no obvious toxicity in main organs. Moreover, photothermal therapy induced by SWCNT under near-infrared radiation further facilitated SWCNT-Cur to inhibit the tumor growth in vivo. In addition, solvent residue is negligible in SWCNT-Cur formulation, and hydrogen bonding was formed between void carriers and curcumin, as demonstrated by GC chromatograph and IR spectra. Furthermore, experiments of confocal microscopy and spectrofluorometer showed that SWCNT-Cur gave a six-fold higher uptake for curcumin compared to native curcumin in human prostate cancer PC-3 cells. In conclusion, curcumin delivery with functionalized SWCNT is a promising strategy to enhance anticancer activity in vivo by enhancing cell uptake and blood concentration, changing physicochemical properties of curcumin and combining phototherapeutic with chemotherapeutic effects.""","""['Haixia Li', 'Nan Zhang', 'Yongwei Hao', 'Yali Wang', 'Shasha Jia', 'Hongling Zhang']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Drug Deliv""","""['Formulation of curcumin delivery with functionalized single-walled carbon nanotubes: characteristics and anticancer effects in vitro.', 'Dual functional matrix metalloproteinase-responsive curcumin-loaded nanoparticles for tumor-targeted treatment.', 'Novel curcumin-loaded magnetic nanoparticles for pancreatic cancer treatment.', 'Carbon nanotubes for delivery of small molecule drugs.', 'Enhancement of Biological and Pharmacological Properties of an Encapsulated Polyphenol: Curcumin.', 'Carbon Nanomaterials (CNMs) in Cancer Therapy: A Database of CNM-Based Nanocarrier Systems.', 'Assessment of Pristine Carbon Nanotubes Toxicity in Rodent Models.', 'Eco-friendly synthesis of carbon nanotubes and their cancer theranostic applications.', 'Phytofabricated Nanoparticle Formulation for Cancer Treatment: A Comprehensive Review.', 'Nanomaterials as Promising Theranostic Tools in Nanomedicine and Their Applications in Clinical Disease Diagnosis and Treatment.']"""

However, there are controversies about the use of PSA as a population screening test because of the high potential for overdiagnosis and overtreatment associated. The net benefit of screening is unclear and according to the available recommendations, it should be offered to well-informed men with an adequate health status and a life-expectancy of at least 10 years or to men at elevated risk of having PCa. In addition, the factors that influence test results are unclear, as is impact of false positive or negative results on patient health.Our objective is to assess the clinical and analytical factors associated with the presence of false positive and false negative results and the diagnostic/therapeutic process followed by these patients.  Methods and analysis:   A prospective observational cohort study will be carried out. We will include a cohort of patients with a positive PSA result (1.081 patients) and a sample of patients with negative results (572 patients); both will be followed for 2 years by reviewing medical records to assess the variables associated with these results, as well as characteristics of patient management after a positive PSA value. We will include those patients with a PSA determination from 2 hospitals in the Valencian Community. Patients who have been previously diagnosed with prostate cancer or who are being followed for previous high PSA values will be excluded.

This study based on results of transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsies aimed to determine whether C-reactive protein (CRP) and sterile pyuria were clinically useful in the evaluation of patients with suspect of prostate cancer.  Materials and methods:   This study is a cross-sectional prospective study of patients without clinical prostatitis symptoms. Characteristics of the 200 consecutive patients recruited were 3-20 ng/mL value of serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA), normal digital rectal examination finding, and sterile urine culture result. All patients underwent 12-core prostatic biopsy. 163 of the 200 patients had benign prostatic hyperplasia confirmed through histology, while the residual 37 patients had prostate cancer. Patients with pre-treatment urinary leukocyte count ≤ 3/high power field were categorized as non-pyuria, whilst those with pre-treatment urinary leukocyte count > 3/high power field were categorized as pyuria. The serum CRP level was also used to differentiate patients before the biopsy. Subgroups were compared regarding a number of clinical variables.  Results:   Histology revealed that 70% of pyuria patients and 38.5% of non-pyuria patients presented inflammation (p = 0.001). The pyuria group exhibited significantly higher total PSA compared to the non-pyuria group (p = 0.044). The two groups did not differ significantly regarding cancer detection rate (p = 0.752). CRP groups were similar regarding cancer detection and histologically-detected inflammation rates.  Conclusion:   In patients with no evidence of clinical prostatitis, sterile pyuria should be considered as a cause of increased PSA. Although sterile pyuria cannot predict non-palpable prostate cancer, it should be taken into account in urological evaluation in order to demonstrate minute prostatic inflammation due to its simplicity, convenience and non-invasiveness.""","""['Selamettin Demir']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Arch Ital Urol Androl""","""['Clinical significance of urinary white blood cell count and serum C-reactive protein level for detection of non-palpable prostate cancer.', 'Association of serum prostate-specific antigen levels with the results of the prostate needle biopsy.', 'Detection of prostate cancer and changes in prostate-specific antigen (PSA) six months after surgery for benign prostatic hyperplasia in patients with elevated PSA.', 'Prospective evaluation of prostate specific antigen and prostate specific antigen density in the detection of nonpalpable and stage T1C carcinoma of the prostate.', 'The incidence of the variability of the free PSA/total PSA ratio on the early diagnosis of prostate cancer.']"""

The Ledermann method was used to reallocate the deaths. The number of deaths before and after the correction revealed a significant variation, especially the figures for breast cancer where the variation was 53.5%. With corrected data, the elderly aged 80 years or older had a prostate cancer death rate which was 18 times higher than those aged 60 to 64 years. Higher levels of prostate cancer deaths among men, and breast cancer among women, were observed in all of the northeastern states. Tracheal, bronchial, lung and stomach cancer resulted in different levels of distribution according to gender, with higher rates among men than among women.

African American men have higher incidence and mortality rate from prostate cancer compared to Caucasian men in North America, indicating the prostate cancer is a major public health problem in this population. Studies of prostate cancer have been hampered by various factors including (1) restricted access to tissues, (2) difficulties in propagating premalignant lesions and primary prostate tumors in vitro, and (3) limited availability of prostate cell lines for in vitro studies. There is no commercially available pair of non-malignant and tumor cells derived from the same prostate cancer patient. Primary prostate epithelial cells grow for a finite life span and then senesce. Immortalization is defined by continuous growth of otherwise senescing cells and is believed to represent an early stage in tumor progression. To examine these early stages, we have developed in vitro models of prostate epithelial cell immortalization. Generation of human primary epithelial (HPE) cells has been achieved using the serum-free keratinocyte growth medium. Retrovirus containing human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) was also used for the generation of primary non-malignant and malignant tumor cells. In addition, we have established the first immortalized cell lines of a pair of non-malignant and malignant tumors derived from an African American prostate cancer patient. Interestingly, we have found that the Rock inhibitor and feeder cells induced the conditioned reprogramming (CR) of epithelial cells-normal and tumor epithelial cells from many tissues to proliferate indefinitely in vitro, without transduction of viral or cellular genes. More recently, using CR, we have established normal and tumor cultures respectively from a patient prostatectomy. These CR cells grow indefinitely in vitro and retain stable karyology. The tumor-derived CR cells produced tumors in SCID mice.

Patients and methods:   We evaluated 575 patients with mCNPC from 10 hospitals. Patients were stratified into 2 groups according to their initial PSA: PSA < 100 and PSA ≥ 100 groups. We compared castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC)-free survival, overall survival (OS), and OS from the CRPC diagnosis between the groups. Multivariate Cox regression analysis was performed to evaluate the effect of initial PSA level on prognosis.  Results:   Of the 575 patients, 196 (34%) patients belonged to the PSA < 100 group. No significant difference was found in patients' backgrounds except for PSA, the extent of disease, and high tumor burden between the groups. CRPC-free survival was significantly shorter in the PSA ≥ 100 group than in the PSA < 100 group. However, the OS after CRPC diagnosis was significantly shorter in the PSA < 100 group than that of the PSA ≥ 100 group. Multivariate analyses showed that PSA < 100 ng/mL was an independent factor for OS after CRPC, whereas no significant association was observed in the CRPC-free survival and OS.  Conclusions:   A significant effect of initial PSA < 100 ng/mL on OS after CRPC was observed.

In international comparisons, its overall level of access to radiotherapy appears sufficient. However, challenges exist due to Canada's large geographic area and small population density. The association between access and cancer outcomes nationally has not yet been described.  Materials and methods:   We quantified geographic accessibility for 2012 using the linear distance from each Canadian health region centroid to the nearest radiotherapy center. We used geospatial analytic techniques to detect clusters of age-standardized all-cancer mortality-to-incidence ratios (MIRs) across health regions, from 2010-2012. Global ordinary least squares (OLS) and geographically-weighted regression (GWR) were conducted to examine relationships between distance and MIR, adjusting for sociodemographic factors.  Results:   Median distance from health region centroid to nearest radiotherapy center was 101.73 km (range 1.14-2095.12). One cluster of worse outcomes (MIR range 0.45-0.88) involved most of northern Canada, with a second cluster of better outcomes (MIR range 0.40-0.41) in southern British Columbia. In both regression models, regions with longer distance to radiotherapy center (ß = 0.0001), increased smoking (ß = 0.002), and poorer food security (ß = -0.003) were significantly associated with worse outcomes (OLS R2 = 0.70, GWR R2 = 0.74). Distance remained independently associated with MIR for lung and colorectal cancer subgroups, but not breast and prostate.  Conclusions:   A clear north-south discordance in cancer outcomes exists in Canada, with poorer outcomes in the north, while radiotherapy centers are concentrated along the south. Increased distance to radiotherapy, along with other sociodemographic and health-system factors, are associated with poorer cancer outcomes. Our study could be replicated, particularly in other high-income countries, to help identify national patterns and regional disparities in access and outcomes.""","""['Jessica Chan', 'Alfredo Polo', 'Eduardo Zubizarreta', 'Jean-Marc Bourque', 'Timothy P Hanna', 'Marc Gaudet', 'Kristopher Dennis', 'Michael Brundage', 'Ben Slotman', 'May Abdel-Wahab']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Radiother Oncol""","""[""Lesson from Canada's Universal Care: socially disadvantaged patients use more health services, still have poorer health."", ""Socioeconomic status, access to health care, and outcomes after acute myocardial infarction in Canada's universal health care system."", 'Income-based inequities in access to psychotherapy and other mental health services in Canada and Australia.', 'Expanding global access to radiotherapy.', 'Inequity in access to cancer care: a review of the Canadian literature.', 'Barriers to cancer treatment and care for people experiencing structural vulnerability: a secondary analysis of ethnographic data.', 'A Comparison Between the Rates of Radiation Oncologist and Urologist Consultations in Men Diagnosed With Prostate Cancer in Northern Ontario, Canada.', 'Insurance-based disparities in breast cancer treatment pathways in a universal healthcare system: a qualitative study.', 'Value of Geographical Information Systems in Analyzing Geographic Accessibility to Inform Radiotherapy Planning: A Systematic Review.', 'Healthcare Inequities Experienced by Patients with Cancer: A Qualitative Study in Medellín, Colombia.']"""

Besides, the prognostic nomogram was developed using R software according to the result of multivariable Cox regression analysis.

UCFCP considers, together with the probabilities of local tumour control (TCP) and deterministic (late) sequelae (NTCP), the second primary cancer risk (SPCR) due to photon and neutron peripheral doses.  Methods and materials:   Thirty-six radiotherapy plans were produced for the same CT. 6, 10, 15 and 18 MV 3DCRT, IMRT and VMAT (77.4 Gy in 43 fractions) and 6 and 10 MV SBRT (36.25 Gy in 5 fractions with flattened and FFF beams) for Elekta, Siemens and Varian Linacs plans were included. DVH and peripheral organ dosimetry were used to compute TCP, NTCP, and SPCR (the competition and LNT models) for further plan ranking.  Results:   Biological models (and parameters) used predicted an outcome which is in agreement with epidemiological findings. SBRT plans showed the lowest SPCR and a below average NTCPrectal. High energy plans did not rank worse than the low energy ones. Intensity modulated plans were ranked above the 3D conformal techniques.  Conclusions:   According to UCFCP, the best plans were the10 MV SBRTs. SPCR rates were low and did not show a substantial impact on plan ranking. High energy intensity-modulated plans did not increase in excess the average of SPCR.

Prostate epithelium has a unique metabolism compared to other tissues. Normal prostate exhibits low levels of mitochondrial respiration and there is a metabolic switch to increased oxidative phosphorylation in PCa. 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) is the major circulating form of vitamin D and is used clinically to determine vitamin D status. Activation of 25(OH)D to the transcriptionally active form, 1,25(OH)2D occurs via a reduction-oxidation (redox) reaction within the mitochondria that is catalyzed by the P450 enzyme, CYP27B1. We sought to determine if hydroxylation of 25(OH)D by CYP27B1 contributes to non-genomic activity of vitamin D by altering the redox-dependent state of the mitochondria in benign prostate epithelial cells. Exposure to 25(OH)D produced a transient pro-oxidant effect and change in mitochondrial membrane potential that was dependent on CYP27B1. Extended exposure ultimately suppressed mitochondrial respiration, consistent with a protective effect of 25(OH)D in supporting benign prostate metabolism. To model physiologically relevant changes in vitamin D, cells were cultured in constant 25(OH)D then changed to high or deficient concentrations. This model also incurred a biphasic effect with a pro-oxidant shift after short exposure followed by decreased respiration after 16 h. Several genes involved in redox cycling and Mitochondrial Health were regulated by 25(OH)D in these cells. These results indicate a secondary non-genomic mechanism for vitamin D to contribute to prostate cell health by supporting normal mitochondrial respiration.""","""['Chuck C Blajszczak', 'Larisa Nonn']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""J Steroid Biochem Mol Biol""","""['Kinetic studies of 25-hydroxy-19-nor-vitamin D3 and 1 alpha,25-dihydroxy-19-nor-vitamin D3 hydroxylation by CYP27B1 and CYP24A1.', 'Mammary epithelial cell transformation is associated with deregulation of the vitamin D pathway.', 'Differential expression and regulation of vitamin D hydroxylases and inflammatory genes in prostate stroma and epithelium by 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D in men with prostate cancer and an in vitro model.', 'The role of Vitamin D3 metabolism in prostate cancer.', 'Inhibition of prostate cancer growth by vitamin D: Regulation of target gene expression.', 'Vitamin D and chronic kidney disease: Insights on lipid metabolism of tubular epithelial cell and macrophages in tubulointerstitial fibrosis.', 'Vitamin D Attenuates Pain and Cartilage Destruction in OA Animals via Enhancing Autophagic Flux and Attenuating Inflammatory Cell Death.', 'Vitamin D regulation of energy metabolism in cancer.', 'Vitamin D Deficiency has no Impact on PSA Reference Ranges in a General University Hospital - A Retrospective Analysis.']"""

However, research into the clinically relevant effects of interventions conducted in heterogeneous patient populations and in real-life clinical practice settings is warranted.  Methods and findings:   We conducted a pragmatic, multicentre, parallel randomised controlled trial in 5 Danish urological departments. Recruitment began in May 2015, the first participant was randomised in June 2015, and the last participant was included in February 2017. In total, 214 men with prostate cancer were randomly assigned to either 6 months of free-of-charge football training twice weekly at a local club (football group [FG]) (n = 109) or usual care (usual care group [UG]) (n = 105), including brief information on physical activity recommendations at randomisation. Participants were on average 68.4 (SD 6.2) years old, 157 (73%) were retired, 87 (41%) were on castration-based treatment, 19 (9%) had received chemotherapy, and 41 (19%) had skeletal metastases at baseline. In this 1-year follow-up study, we evaluated the effects of community-based football training on the following outcomes: primary outcome, quality of life; secondary outcomes: continuation of football after 6 months, hip and lumbar spine bone mineral density (BMD), mental health score, fat and lean body mass, and safety outcomes, i.e., fractures, falls, and hospital admissions. Intention to treat (ITT) and per protocol (PP) analyses were conducted. No statistically significant between-group difference was observed in change in prostate-cancer-specific quality of life (ITT: 1.9 points [95% CI -1.9 to 5.8], p = 0.325; PP: 3.6 points [95% CI -0.9 to 8.2], p = 0.119). A statistically significant between-group difference was observed in change in total hip BMD, in favour of FG (0.007 g/cm2 [95% CI 0.004 to 0.013], p = 0.037). No differences were observed in change in lumbar spine BMD or lean body mass. Among patients allocated to football, 59% chose to continue playing football after the end of the 6-month intervention period. At 1-year follow-up in the PP population, FG participants had more improvement on the Mental Component Summary (2.9 [95% CI 0.0 to 5.7], p = 0.048 points higher) than UG participants, as well as a greater loss of fat mass (-0.9 kg [95% CI -1.7 to -0.1], p = 0.029). There were no differences between groups in relation to fractures or falls. Hospital admissions were more frequent in UG compared to FG (33 versus 20; the odds ratio based on PP analysis was 0.34 for FG compared to UG). There were 3 deaths in FG and 4 in UG. Main limitations of the study were the physically active control group and assessment of physical activity by means of self-report.  Conclusions:   In this trial, participants allocated to football appeared to have improved hip BMD and fewer hospital admissions. Men who played football more than once a week for 1 year lost fat mass and reported improved mental health.

Here, we assess time and tissue dependence of R2* enhancement and its impact on pharmacokinetic parameter quantification and treatment monitoring. Multiecho DCE-MRI was performed at 7 T on mice bearing subcutaneous TOV-21G human ovarian cancer xenografts (n = 8) and on the transgenic adenocarcinoma of the mouse prostate (TRAMP) model (n = 7). Subsequently, the TOV-21G tumor-bearing mice were treated with bevacizumab and rescanned 2 days later. Pharmacokinetic analysis (extended Tofts model) was performed using either the first echo signal only (standard single-echo DCE-MRI) or the estimated signal at TE = 0 derived from exponential fitting of R2* relaxation (R2*-corrected). Neglecting R2* enhancement causes underestimation of Gd-DOTA concentration (peak enhancement underestimated by 9.4%-16% in TOV-21G tumors and 13%-20% in TRAMP prostates). Median Ktrans and ve were underestimated in every mouse (TOV-21G Ktrans: 11%-19%, TOV-21G ve: 5.3%-8.9%; TRAMP Ktrans: 8.6%-19%, TRAMP ve: 12%-21%). Bevacizumab treatment reduced Ktrans in all TOV-21G tumors after 48 hours. Treatment effect was significantly greater in all tumors after R2* correction (median change of -0.050 min-1 in R2*-corrected Ktrans vs. -0.037 min-1 in uncorrected Ktrans).

The aim of the present study was to identify the effects of proto-oncogene serine/threonine-protein kinase pim-1 (pim-1) in the proliferation of chemotherapeutic drug-resistant prostate cancer cells. Androgen-independent human prostate cancer cell lines PC3 and DU145 were used in the current study. Cisplatin-sensitive PC3 cells and cisplatin-resistant PC3/DDP cells were used in drug-resistance assays. The expression levels of pim-1, permeability glycoprotein (p-gp), caspase-3 and cleaved caspase-3 were determined using western blotting analysis; pim-1 was knocked down using pim-1-specific short hairpin RNA (shRNA); cell viability was determined using MTT assay and IC50 values of the chemotherapeutic drugs in human prostate cancer cells tested were calculated using GraphPad 5 software. Androgen-independent human prostate cancer cell lines PC3 and DU145 were transfected with pim-1-targeted or control shRNA, and MTT results revealed that pim-1 knockdown significantly inhibited PC3 and DU145 cell viability in a time-dependent manner (P<0.01). Cisplatin-resistant cells PC3/DDP exhibited higher levels of pim-1 and p-gp expression compared with cisplatin-sensitive PC3 cells; and pim-1 knockdown markedly increased chemotherapeutic drug sensitivity in PC3/DDP cells. In addition, pim-1 knockdown increased chemotherapeutic drug sensitivity in PC3/DDP cells. The molecular mechanism of drug sensitivity was discovered to be partly due to pim-1 knockdown, as it significantly increased apoptosis in cisplatin-resistant PC3/DDP cells.

The prediction of latent disease-lncRNA associations can help to understand the pathogenesis of complex human diseases at the level of lncRNA, which also contributes to the detection of disease biomarkers, and the diagnosis, treatment, prognosis and prevention of disease. Nevertheless, it is still a challenging and urgent task to accurately identify latent disease-lncRNA association. Discovering latent links on the basis of biological experiments is time-consuming and wasteful, necessitating the development of computational prediction models. In this study, a computational prediction model has been remodeled as a matrix completion framework of the recommendation system by completing the unknown items in the rating matrix. A novel method named faster randomized matrix completion for latent disease-lncRNA association prediction (FRMCLDA) has been proposed by virtue of improved randomized partial SVD (rSVD-BKI) on a heterogeneous bilayer network. First, the correlated data source and experimentally validated information of diseases and lncRNAs are integrated to construct a heterogeneous bilayer network. Next, the integrated heterogeneous bilayer network can be formalized as a comprehensive adjacency matrix which includes lncRNA similarity matrix, disease similarity matrix, and disease-lncRNA association matrix where the uncertain disease-lncRNA associations are referred to as blank items. Then, a matrix approximate to the original adjacency matrix has been designed with predicted scores to retrieve the blank items. The construction of the approximate matrix could be equivalently resolved by the nuclear norm minimization. Finally, a faster singular value thresholding algorithm with a randomized partial SVD combing a new sub-space reuse technique has been utilized to complete the adjacency matrix. The results of leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) experiments and 5-fold cross-validation (5-fold CV) experiments on three different benchmark databases have confirmed the availability and adaptability of FRMCLDA in inferring latent relationships of disease-lncRNA pairs, and in inferring lncRNAs correlated with novel diseases without any prior interaction information. Additionally, case studies have shown that FRMCLDA is able to effectively predict latent lncRNAs correlated with three widespread malignancies: prostate cancer, colon cancer, and gastric cancer.""","""['Wen Li', 'Shulin Wang', 'Junlin Xu', 'Guo Mao', 'Geng Tian', 'Jialiang Yang']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Front Genet""","""['Predicting lncRNA-disease associations using network topological similarity based on deep mining heterogeneous networks.', 'LDAI-ISPS: LncRNA-Disease Associations Inference Based on Integrated Space Projection Scores.', 'HOPMCLDA: predicting lncRNA-disease associations based on high-order proximity and matrix completion.', 'RWSF-BLP: a novel lncRNA-disease association prediction model using random walk-based multi-similarity fusion and bidirectional label propagation.', 'Long non-coding RNAs and complex diseases: from experimental results to computational models.', 'LncRNA FAS-AS1 upregulated by its genetic variation rs6586163 promotes cell apoptosis in nasopharyngeal carcinoma through regulating mitochondria function and Fas splicing.', 'MNNMDA: Predicting human microbe-disease association via a method to minimize matrix nuclear norm.', 'A clustering-based sampling method for miRNA-disease association prediction.', 'Fusion of KATZ measure and space projection to fast probe potential lncRNA-disease associations in bipartite graphs.', 'Predicting LncRNA-Disease Association by a Random Walk With Restart on Multiplex and Heterogeneous Networks.']"""

Methods:   A total of 329 patients who underwent robot-assisted radical prostatectomy between 2013 and 2016 were prospectively enrolled in this study. These patients were divided into the preoperative urinary continence group and the preoperative urinary incontinence group according to the 1-h pad test. The time to achieve urinary continence, lower urinary tract function evaluated by uroflowmetry and post-voided residual urine volume, and quality of life evaluated by King's Health Questionnaire and International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire-Short Form were compared between these two groups.

Methods:   Population-based data on Pca patients in 2004-2015 from the US SEER database were investigated. The connection among ELN number and stage migration, overall survival (OS), and prostate cancer-specific survival (CSS) were evaluated by performing multivariable-adjusted logistic, Cox proportional hazards, and fine-gray competing-risk regression models, respectively. LOWESS smoother was used to fit the series of ELN number, odds ratios (OR), and hazard ratios (HR), while the Chow test was used to resolve the structural breakpoints. Subgroup and interaction analyses were performed in different risk populations.  Results:   Overall, 84,838 patients were analyzed. Serial improvements were seen in stage migration (OR, 1.072, P < 0.001), OS (HR, 0.991; P < 0.001), and CSS (HR, 0.983; P < 0.001) per additional ELN after adjusting for confounders. Subgroup analysis revealed that the ELN number gains the most staging and survival benefits in high-risk population (P for interaction < 0.001). Cut-point analyses suggested that an optimal number of 12 ELNs, which was verified by the cumulative incidence curve, had a strong capability to distinguish different probabilities of CSS.

Accordingly, the drug-drug interaction (DDI) potential of darolutamide was investigated in both nonclinical and clinical studies.  Methods:   In vitro studies were performed to determine the potential for darolutamide to be a substrate, inducer or inhibitor for cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoforms, other metabolizing enzymes and drug transporters. A phase I drug-interaction study in healthy volunteers evaluated the impact of co-administering rifampicin [CYP3A4 and P-glycoprotein (P-gp) inducer] and itraconazole [CYP3A4, P-gp and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) inhibitor] on the pharmacokinetics of darolutamide. Two further phase I studies assessed the impact of co-administering oral darolutamide on the pharmacokinetics of midazolam (sensitive CYP3A4 substrate) and dabigatran etexilate (P-gp substrate) and the impact on the pharmacokinetics of co-administered rosuvastatin [a substrate for BCRP, organic anion-transporting polypeptide (OATP)1B1, OATP1B3 and organic anion transporter (OAT)3].  Results:   In vitro, darolutamide was predominantly metabolized via oxidative biotransformation catalyzed by CYP3A4 and was identified as a substrate for P-gp and BCRP. The enzymatic activity of nine CYP isoforms was not inhibited or slightly inhibited in vitro with darolutamide, and a rank order and mechanistic static assessment indicated that risk of clinically relevant DDIs via CYP inhibition is very low. In vitro, darolutamide exhibited no relevant induction of CYP1A2 or CYP2B6 activity. Inhibition of BCRP-, P-gp-, OAT3-, MATE1-, MATE2-K-, OATP1B1- and OATP1B3-mediated transport was observed in vitro. Phase I data showed that darolutamide exposure increased 1.75-fold with co-administered itraconazole and decreased by 72% with rifampicin. Co-administration of darolutamide with CYP3A4/P-gp substrates showed no effect or only minor effects. Rosuvastatin exposure increased 5.2-fold with darolutamide because of BCRP and probably also OATPB1/OATPB3 inhibition.

Besides, qPCR and immunofluorescence analysis showed that PC-3 cells, the TP53 414delC mutation of which were repaired, expressed wild type p53 again. Also, significantly increased number of apoptotic cells, driven by the repaired TP53 gene were detected compared to the control cells by flow cytometry analysis. As a result, sgRNA2 guided CRISPR/Cas9 system accompanied by ssODN was shown to effectively repair the TP53 414delC gene region and inhibit the cell proliferation of PC-3 cells.

In this population, polypharmacy for age-related comorbidities is common and may increase drug-drug interaction (DDI) risks. Preclinical/phase I study data suggest darolutamide has a low DDI potential-other than breast cancer resistance protein/organic anion transporter protein substrates (e.g., statins), no clinically relevant effect on comedications is expected.  Objective:   Our objective was to evaluate the effect of commonly administered drugs on the pharmacokinetics of darolutamide and the effect of comedications potentially affected by darolutamide on safety in patients with nmCRPC.  Patients and methods:   Comorbidities and comedication use in the 1509 ARAMIS participants treated with darolutamide 600 mg twice daily or placebo were assessed. A population pharmacokinetic analysis evaluated whether comedications affected the pharmacokinetics of darolutamide in a subset of 388 patients. A subgroup analysis of adverse events (AEs) in statin users versus nonusers was conducted.  Results:   Most participants (median age 74 years) had at least one comorbidity (98.4% in both arms) and used at least one comedication (98.7% with darolutamide vs. 98.0% with placebo); these were similar across study arms. Despite frequent use of comedications with DDI potential, no significant effects on darolutamide pharmacokinetics were identified. Comedications included lipid-modifying agents (34.5%), β-blockers (29.7%), antithrombotics (42.8%), and systemic antibiotics (26.9%). AE incidence was similar across study arms in statin users and nonusers. Study limitations include the small sample size for sub-analyses.

Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), a class of long transcripts, has been reported as essential regulators in tumorigenesis. IDH1 antisense RNA 1 (IDH1-AS1) is an lncRNA which can interact with genes to regulate the Warburg effect. However, function and mechanism of it in tumorigenesis of PCa remains unclear. Therefore, our current study focused on exploring the role of IDH1-AS1 in PCa tumor growth. At first, the expression of IDH1-AS1 was identified to be upregulated in PCa samples and cell lines. Mechanism associated with the upregulation of IDH1-AS1 was analyzed and demonstrated by mechanism experiments. The result suggested that PAX5 is the transcriptional activator of IDH1-AS1. Functionally, loss-of function assays revealed that silencing of IDH1-AS1 inhibited cell proliferation and induced cell apoptosis both in vitro and in vivo. Through microarray analysis and Gene ontology (GO) analysis, we determined that IDH1-AS1 can affect PCa cell autophagy by upregulating ATG5 expression.

HOTTIP expression has been demonstrated to play a crucial oncogenic role in cancer pathogenesis, and is said to be associated with poor human cancer prognosis. In prostate cancer, HOTTIP has been identified as an oncogene, but its clinicopathologic significance remains unclear. Array-based qRT-PCR was used to investigate lncRNA levels in 10 pairs of prostate cancer tissues and non-neoplastic parenchyma. Tissue microarray (TMA) was constructed using a total of 70 surgically resected prostatic adenocarcinoma tissues obtained from the Korea University Anam Hospital from 2009 to 2013. HOTTIP expression was determined by RNA in situ hybridization(ISH) and was correlated with clinicopathologic features. Increased HOTTIP expression was observed in all available prostate cancer tissue specimens compared with that in paired normal tissue. High HOTTIP expression was positively associated with bad clinicopathologic features, including higher pathologic T stage (p < 0.001), presence of extraprostatic extension (p < 0.001), seminal vesicle invasion (p < 0.001), perineural invasion (p < 0.001), and the tumor involvement of resection margin (p = 0.044). In particular, significantly increased HOTTIP expression was observed in specimens from patients in the high or very high-risk group, according to the 2018 National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines (p < 0.001). Also, patients with high HOTTIP expression showed poorer overall survival than those with low expression.

Materials:   Pathology archives were searched for cases of metastatic tumors to the oral soft tissues and jawbones, 1990 - 2016. Metastases to the skin of face or to major salivary glands have been excluded. Demographic data and histopathological features were analyzed.  Results:   Study population included 60 patients, 35 females and 25 males (ratio of 1.4:1). The age range was 17-87 years, mean 67.7 + 14.36 years. Only 3 (5%) patients were under 40 years, the remaining clustered predominantly in the 60-80 year age group. The mean age of females (59 + 13.84) was significantly lower than that of males (67.44 + 14) (p = 0.03). There was an almost equal distribution between the oral soft tissue and the jawbones (48.3% and 51.7%, respectively). The five most common organs from which metastases were distributed to the oral cavity and jawbones combined were kidney (20%), breast (15%), cutaneous (predominately melanoma, 13%), lung (11.7%) and soft tissue-sarcomas (8.3%). For comparison, Israel National Cancer Registry 2013 reported that the most frequent malignancies were breast (25.8%), colorectal cancer (16.3%), lung (12%) and prostate (10%). Malignant melanoma was 6th (5.4%), kidney malignancy was only 9th in frequency (4.2%). Although the gingiva and jawbones were the most frequent locations, some cases presented in unusual locations, (mandibular vestibule, lower lip, posterior dorsal tongue), without any specific clinical feature to suggest metastasis.  Conclusions:   The most frequent primary origins for oral metastasis do not correspond to the relative frequency of the primary tumors in the population, indicating that metastatic spread is not a random process. Although the majority of metastasis involves the gingiva and jawbones, any other oral mucosal location might be involved.

Materials and methods:   A single-center, retrospective study was performed in men at risk for prostate cancer who (n = 140) underwent TBx and RP between November 2012 and August 2018. Comparisons were made between patients clinically staged by preoperative MRI and TBx Gleason grade group (GGG) and stage after RP. Multivariable regression was performed to identify factors associated with MRI and TBx compared to RP grading, staging, and consistency with National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) risk stratification.  Results:   There was an increase in NCCN risk stratification in 47 men (33.6%) and a decrease in 17 men (12.1%) compared to the resected prostate. GGG upgrading and downgrading occurred in 35 (25.0%) and 31 men (22.1%), respectively. Upstaging occurred in 41 men (29.3%). In adjusted analysis for age, BMI, PSA Density (PSAD), median maximal diameter of the regions of interest, and PIRADS, men with PIRADS 4 were less likely to be upgraded (OR 0.26, 95% CI 0.08-0.81, P = .020) than PIRADS 3.

However the risk of underestimating the aggressiveness of a patient's PrCa can be a significant source of anxiety and a barrier to patient acceptance of AS. The uncertainty is particularly keen for African American (AA) men who are about 1.7 times more likely to be diagnosed with PrCa than European American (EA) men and about 2.4 times more likely to die of this disease. The AA population, as many other populations in the Americas, is genetically heterogeneous with varying degrees of admixture from West Africans (WAs), Europeans, and Native Americans (NAs). Recommendations for PrCa screening and management rarely consider potential differences in risk within the AA population. We compared WA genetic ancestry in AA men undergoing standard prostate biopsy who were diagnosed with no cancer, low-grade PrCa (Gleason Sum 6), or higher grade PrCa (Gleason Sum 7-10). We found that WA genetic ancestry was significantly higher in men who were diagnosed with PrCa on biopsy, compared to men who were cancer-negative, and highest in men who were diagnosed with higher grade PrCa (Gleason Sum 7-10).

The aim of our study was to evaluate correlations between PSA levels and standardized uptake values (SUV) in patients with recurrent prostate cancer.  Methods:   We analyzed 282 prostate cancer patients undergoing PET-CT due to suspicion of recurrence. Levels of PSA and PSA change per month were analyzed, together with maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax).  Results:   PET/CT results were positive in 175 patients (62.1%) and negative in 107 patients (37.9%). In the positive group, PSA levels were significantly higher. The ROC curve analysis indicated PSA level of 1.70 ng/ml and PSA level change in time of 0.12 ng/ml are the optimal cut-off values. Patients were divided into subgroups: with metastases (M), local relapse (L), and local relapse and metastases (M + L). The latest PSA levels, were similar in subgroups L and M: 5.00 (2.98-10.30) ng/ml and 3.90 (1.27-14.08) ng/ml, but lower than in subgroup M + L: 12.43 (6.08-49.36) ng/ml.

However, the incidence and clinical implication of PD-1 and PD-L1 expression in prostate cancer remain poorly understood. The current study aimed to determine the status of PD-1/PD-L1 expression in prostate cancer specimens and its prognostic significance.We immunohistochemically stained for PD-1 and PD-L1 in our tissue microarray (TMA) consisting of radical prostatectomy specimens. The expression of PD-1/PD-L1 was designated as positive when moderate to strong staining or weak staining was seen in at least 1% or 10%, respectively, of tumor cells and/or associated immune cells. We then evaluated the relationship between the expression of each protein and clinicopathological features available for our patient cohort.PD-1 and PD-L1 were positive in 3 (1.5%) and 1 (0.5%) of 201 non-neoplastic prostate tissues, and also in 17 (7.7%) and 29 (13.2%) of 220 prostate cancers, respectively. PD-1 and PD-L1 were also expressed in tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes/macrophages in 172 (78.2%) and 33 (15.0%) cases, respectively. PD-L1 expression in tumor cells was more often seen in high pT stage (pT2: 10.8% vs pT3/4: 20.4%; P = .072; pT2/3a: 11.4% vs pT3b/4: 31.6%; P = .013) or lymph node-positive (pN0: 10.1% vs pN1: 27.3%; P = .086) cases, whereas PD-1 expression in tumor cells was not significantly associated with pT/pN stage. In addition, there were no statistically significant associations between PD-1/PD-L1 expression in tumor cells or tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes/macrophages versus patient age, preoperative prostate-specific antigen level, or Gleason score. Kaplan-Meier analysis coupled with log-rank test further revealed no significant associations between PD-1/PD-L1 expression in tumor cells (P = .619/P = .315), tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes/macrophages (P = .954/P = .155), or either or both of them (P = .964/P = .767) versus disease recurrence after radical prostatectomy.PD-1/PD-L1 expression was detected in a subset of prostate cancers. In particular, PD-L1 expression was considerably up-regulated in nonorgan-confined tumors.

However, there is no large-scale study investigating the expression of Hsp90 in pan-cancer so far, and the molecular mechanisms leading to aberrant Hsp90 expression are also largely unknown. To address these questions, we performed an in silico analysis of Hsp90 expression using mRNA sequencing data from The Cancer Genome Atlas study. The results were further validated using independent datasets. We found that the expression of HSP90AA1, a subtype of Hsp90, was much higher in hepatocellular carcinoma than in adjacent normal liver tissue. A large cancer panel with eight more cancer types revealed a similar trend except for prostate cancer, which had low HSP90AA1 expression in tumor tissue. Heat shock factor 1 followed a similar trend as HSP90AA1, with higher expression in cancer. HSP90AA1 expression was closely related to its copy numbers. Deletion of the HSP90AA1 locus in a subset of hepatocellular carcinoma led to low HSP90AA1 expression. In addition, higher HSP90AA1 expression was associated with poorer prognosis in hepatocellular carcinoma patients. In a multivariable analysis including tumor, node and metastasis stage, HSP90AA1 expression remained a negative prognostic factor, suggesting that the effect of HSP90AA1 was independent of tumor stage. In conclusion, we demonstrated that high HSP90AA1 expression was ubiquitous in cancer and that HSP90AA1 was a potential diagnostic and prognostic biomarker for hepatocellular carcinoma.""","""['Wei Chen', 'Guanghua Li', 'Jianjun Peng', 'Weigang Dai', 'Qiao Su', 'Yulong He']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Eur J Cancer Prev""","""['Amplification and high-level expression of heat shock protein 90 marks aggressive phenotypes of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 negative breast cancer.', 'HN1 as a diagnostic and prognostic biomarker for liver cancer.', 'Overexpression of heat shock protein HSP90AA1 and translocase of the outer mitochondrial membrane TOM34 in HCV-induced hepatocellular carcinoma: A pilot study.', 'Roles of circular RNAs in the progression of hepatocellular carcinoma and their values as diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers.', 'Regulation and function of the human HSP90AA1 gene.', 'Shifting the Cancer Screening Paradigm: The Rising Potential of Blood-Based Multi-Cancer Early Detection Tests.', 'Integrating Network Pharmacology and Bioinformatics to Explore the Effects of Dangshen (Codonopsis pilosula) Against Hepatocellular Carcinoma: Validation Based on the Active Compound Luteolin.', 'Based on network pharmacology and molecular docking to predict the mechanism of Huangqi in the treatment of castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'miR-550a-3p is a prognostic biomarker and exerts tumor-suppressive functions by targeting HSP90AA1 in diffuse malignant peritoneal mesothelioma.', 'Patient-specific Boolean models of signalling networks guide personalised treatments.']"""

However, this process is time-consuming and subject to high inter-observer variability. Machine learning-based methods have the potential to improve efficient throughput of large volumes of slides while decreasing variability, but they are not easy to develop because they require substantial amounts of labeled training data. In this paper, we propose a deep learning-based classification technique and data augmentation methods for accurate grading of PCa in histopathology images in the presence of limited data. Our method combines the predictions of three separate convolutional neural networks (CNNs) that work with different patch sizes. This enables our method to take advantage of the greater amount of contextual information in larger patches as well as greater quantity of smaller patches in the labeled training data. The predictions produced by the three CNNs are combined using a logistic regression model, which is trained separately after the CNN training. To effectively train our models, we propose new data augmentation methods and empirically study their effects on the classification accuracy. The proposed method achieves an accuracy of [Formula: see text] in classifying cancerous patches versus benign patches and an accuracy of [Formula: see text] in classifying low-grade (i.e., Gleason grade 3) from high-grade (i.e., Gleason grades 4 and 5) patches. The agreement level of our automatic grading method with expert pathologists is within the range of agreement between pathologists. Our experiments indicate that data augmentation is necessary for achieving expert-level performance with deep learning-based methods. A combination of image-space augmentation and feature-space augmentation leads to the best results. Our study shows that well-designed and properly trained deep learning models can achieve PCa Gleason grading accuracy that is comparable to an expert pathologist.""","""['Davood Karimi', 'Guy Nir', 'Ladan Fazli', 'Peter C Black', 'Larry Goldenberg', 'Septimiu E Salcudean']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""IEEE J Biomed Health Inform""","""['Comparison of Artificial Intelligence Techniques to Evaluate Performance of a Classifier for Automatic Grading of Prostate Cancer From Digitized Histopathologic Images.', 'Automated deep-learning system for Gleason grading of prostate cancer using biopsies: a diagnostic study.', 'Development of a Deep Learning Algorithm for the Histopathologic Diagnosis and Gleason Grading of Prostate Cancer Biopsies: A Pilot Study.', 'Computer-Aided Prostate Cancer Diagnosis From Digitized Histopathology: A Review on Texture-Based Systems.', 'Contemporary Gleason Grading of Prostatic Carcinoma: An Update With Discussion on Practical Issues to Implement the 2014 International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) Consensus Conference on Gleason Grading of Prostatic Carcinoma.', 'Use of artificial intelligence in discerning the need for prostate biopsy and readiness for clinical practice: a systematic review protocol.', 'Generative Adversarial Networks Can Create High Quality Artificial Prostate Cancer Magnetic Resonance Images.', 'Data-driven color augmentation for H&E stained images in computational pathology.', 'Automated recognition of glomerular lesions in the kidneys of mice by using deep learning.', 'A Deep Learning Model for the Automatic Recognition of Aplastic Anemia, Myelodysplastic Syndromes, and Acute Myeloid Leukemia Based on Bone Marrow Smear.']"""

Methods:   We randomly assigned, in a 1:1 ratio, patients who had previously received docetaxel and an androgen-signaling-targeted inhibitor (abiraterone or enzalutamide) to receive cabazitaxel (at a dose of 25 mg per square meter of body-surface area intravenously every 3 weeks, plus prednisone daily and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor) or the other androgen-signaling-targeted inhibitor (either 1000 mg of abiraterone plus prednisone daily or 160 mg of enzalutamide daily). The primary end point was imaging-based progression-free survival. Secondary end points of survival, response, and safety were assessed.  Results:   A total of 255 patients underwent randomization.

Methods:   A total of 14 837 men treated with radical prostatectomy (RP) during the period 2001 to 2015 were identified from the Cancer Registry of Norway. Of those, 13 198 (89%) patients had complete data on the preoperative prostate-specific antigen level, pathological T-category, Gleason score in the prostatectomy specimen, and margin status. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards models were used to evaluate the risk, and flexible parametric models for the cumulative incidence were fitted to predict the probabilities of secondary treatment (salvage radiotherapy or prophylactic breast radiation), palliative radiotherapy, and prostate cancer-specific mortality.  Results:   After a median follow-up time of 5.2 years (3591 patients with ≥8 years of follow-up), positive surgical margins (PSMs) were independently predictive of secondary treatment (hazard ratio [HR] = 2.43, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 2.21-2.66) and palliative radiotherapy (HR = 1.45, 95% CI = 1.03-2.05). After 10 years, the absolute increased risk for palliative radiotherapy in patients with PSMs after RP varied between 0.1% in pT2 tumors with a Gleason score of 6, to 12% for pT3b tumors with a Gleason score of 9 to 10. PSMs were not independently associated with prostate cancer-specific mortality (HR = 1.14, 95% CI = 0.82-1.59).  Conclusion:   PSMs were associated with increased application of secondary treatment and palliative radiotherapy but were not predictive of prostate cancer-specific mortality. As the use of palliative radiotherapy was only marginally increased in patients with PSMs and the lowest-risk disease characteristics, avoiding PSMs may be of greatest prognostic relevance in patients with higher-risk disease characteristics.""","""['Rune Kvåle', 'Tor Å Myklebust', 'Sophie D Fosså', 'Kirsti Aas', 'Christian Ekanger', 'Svein I Helle', 'Alfred Honoré', 'Bjørn Møller']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Impact of positive surgical margins on prostate-specific antigen failure after radical prostatectomy in adjuvant treatment-naïve patients.', 'High Gleason grade carcinoma at a positive surgical margin predicts biochemical failure after radical prostatectomy and may guide adjuvant radiotherapy.', 'Positive surgical margins: rate, contributing factors and impact on further treatment: findings from the Prostate Cancer Registry.', 'Positive surgical margins after radical prostatectomy: a systematic review and contemporary update.', 'Positive surgical margins after radical prostatectomy.', 'Pathological stage, surgical margin and lymphovascular invasion as prognostic factors after salvage radiotherapy for post-prostatectomy relapsed prostate cancer - outcomes and optimization strategies.', 'Biochemical recurrence of pathological T2+ localized prostate cancer after robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy: A 10-year surveillance.']"""

Using this implementation strategy, the implementation rate of a decision aid was measured in eight hospitals and questionnaires were filled out by 24 care providers and 255 patients. The average implementation rate was 60 per cent (range 31%-100%). Hardly any barriers remained for care providers. Patients who did not use the decision aid appeared to be more unwilling than unable to use the decision aid.

Objective:   The present study aimed to evaluate the in vitro antitumor activity of a new series of hybrid molecules containing coumarin and quinolinone moieties 4 and 5 against four cancer cell lines.  Materials and methods:   A new series of hybrid molecules containing coumarin and quinolinone moieties, 4a-c and 5a-c, were synthesized and screened for their cytotoxicity against prostate PC-3, breast MCF-7, colon HCT- 116 and liver HepG2 cancer cell lines as well as normal breast Hs-371 T.  Results:   All the synthesized compounds were assessed for their in vitro antiproliferative activity against four cancer cell lines and several compounds were found to be active. Further in vitro cell cycle study of compounds 4a and 5a revealed MCF-7 cells arrest at G2 /M phase of the cell cycle profile and induction apoptosis at pre-G1 phase. The apoptosis-inducing activity was evidenced by up-regulation of Bax protein together with the downregulation of the expression of Bcl-2 protein.

The role of KIF20A during tumorigenesis and tumor development has been well studied in several cancers. But the association between the KIF20A clinical role and prostate cancer (PCa) has not been reported yet. In this study, we investigated its potential prognostic effect and its role in progression of prostate cancer.  Methods:   Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction and Western blots were used to investigate the KIF20A transcription and translation levels in 7 pairs of fresh PCa tissue and adjacent normal prostate tissue. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was used to investigate the KIF20A protein level in 114 PCa tissue samples. Bioinformatics analysis was performed to analyze the effect of KIF20A in oncologic prognosis in PCa patients. MTT assay, transwell assay, and colony formation assay in vitro and tumor formation assay in vivo were performed to evaluate the biological behavior of KIF20A in prostate cancer.  Results:   KIF20A was significantly elevated in tumor tissue compared with normal prostate tissue at both the mRNA and the protein level. High expression of KIF20A at the protein level was correlated with adverse clinicopathological features. Bioinformatics analysis showed that the high KIF20A expression group has a poor biochemical recurrence- (BCR-) free survival. Knocking down KIF20A suppressed the proliferation, migration, and invasion of the prostate cancer cell both in vitro and in vivo.  Conclusions:   Our data demonstrated that the high expression of KIF20A was associated with poor clinical outcome and targeting KIF20A could reduce proliferation, migration, and invasion of the prostate cancer cell, indicating that KIF20A might be a potential prognostic and therapeutic target for PCa patients.""","""['Zheng Zhang', 'Ciman Chai', 'Tianyu Shen', 'Xiaoqing Li', 'Junpeng Ji', 'Changying Li', 'Zhiqun Shang', 'Yuanjie Niu']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Dis Markers""","""['KIF20A Affects the Prognosis of Bladder Cancer by Promoting the Proliferation and Metastasis of Bladder Cancer Cells.', 'Down-regulation of protein kinase, DNA-activated, catalytic polypeptide attenuates tumor progression and is an independent prognostic predictor of survival in prostate cancer.', 'm6 A modification of lncRNA PCAT6 promotes bone metastasis in prostate cancer through IGF2BP2-mediated IGF1R mRNA stabilization.', 'Kinesin 12 (KIF15) contributes to the development and tumorigenicity of prostate cancer.', 'Overexpression of Kinesin Family Member 20A Correlates with Disease Progression and Poor Prognosis in Human Nasopharyngeal Cancer: A Retrospective Analysis of 105 Patients.', 'Expression, regulating mechanism and therapeutic target of KIF20A in multiple cancer.', 'High expression of KIF20A in bladder cancer as a potential prognostic target for poor survival of renal cell carcinoma.', 'An evaluation of KIF20A as a prognostic factor and therapeutic target for lung adenocarcinoma using integrated bioinformatics analysis.', 'Integrated Analysis of Transcriptome Data Revealed AURKA and KIF20A as Critical Genes in Medulloblastoma Progression.', 'The kinesin KIF20A promotes progression to castration-resistant prostate cancer through autocrine activation of the androgen receptor.']"""

We report the results of a phase II prospective trial of single-fraction 19 Gy HDR monotherapy with MRI-guided simultaneous focal boost.  Methods:   Eligible patients had low or intermediate risk prostate cancer and an identified lesion on MRI. TRUS based single-fraction HDR monotherapy with MRI fusion was delivered.

However, uncertainty remains about adherence to these protocols.  Objective:   To determine adherence to institution-specific AS inclusion criteria and follow-up schedules within the Movember Foundation's Global Action Plan Prostate Cancer Active Surveillance (GAP3) initiative.  Design, setting, and participants:   We retrospectively assessed the data of 15 101 patients from 25 established AS cohorts worldwide between 2014 and 2016.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Adherence to individual AS inclusion criteria was rated on a five-point Likert scale ranging from poor to excellent. Nonadherence to follow-up schedules was defined as absence of repeat biopsy 1 yr after the scheduled date. Cohorts were pooled into annual and Prostate Cancer Research International: Active Surveillance (PRIAS)-based biopsy schedules, and a generalised linear mixed model was constructed to test for nonadherence.  Results and limitations:   Serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) inclusion criteria were followed in 92%, Gleason score (GS) criteria were followed in 97%, and the number of positive biopsy cores was followed in 94% of men. Both age and tumour stage (T stage) criteria had 99% adherence overall. Pooled nonadherence rates increased over time-8%, 16%, and 34% for annual schedules and 11%, 30%, and 29% for PRIAS-based schedules at 1, 4, and 7 yr, respectively-and did not differ between biopsy schedules. A limitation is that our results do not consider the use of multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging.  Conclusions:   In on-going development of evidence-based AS protocols, variable adherence to PSA and GS inclusion criteria should be considered. Repeat biopsy adherence reduces with increased duration of surveillance, independent of biopsy frequency. This emphasises the importance of risk stratification at the commencement of AS.

These images could be used for ""every patient, every monitor unit"" quality assurance (QA) and eventually adaptive radiotherapy. This study evaluated the imager's sensitivity to potential clinical errors and day-to-day variations from clinical exit images.  Methods:   Open and modulated fields were delivered for each potential error. To evaluate output changes, monitor units were scaled by 2%-10% and delivered to solid water slabs and a homogeneous CIRS phantom. To mimic weight changes, 0.5-5.0 cm of buildup was added to the solid water. To evaluate positioning changes, a homogeneous and heterogeneous CIRS phantom were shifted 2-10 cm and 0.2-1.5 cm, respectively. For each test, mean relative differences (MRDs) and standard deviations in the pixel-difference histograms (σRD ) between test and baseline images were calculated. Lateral shift magnitudes were calculated using cross-correlation and edge-detection filtration. To assess patient variations, MRD and σRD were calculated from six prostate patients' daily exit images and compared between fractions with and without gas present.  Results:   MRDs responded linearly to output and buildup changes with a standard deviation of 0.3%, implying a 1% output change and 0.2 cm changes in buildup could be detected with 2.5σ confidence.

Methods:   From April 2018, SpaceOAR hydrogel spacer was placed in 100 consecutive patients undergoing iodine-125 low-dose-rate brachytherapy. Complications and the status of the placement were evaluated. Deformation of the prostate by the spacer was examined measuring prostate diameters and evaluating the change from preoperative status. The position of the prostate was similarly examined by evaluating the change in distance between the pubic symphysis and the prostate. Post-plan dosimetric data were compared with 200 patients treated without a spacer.  Results:   No complications were found during either the intraoperative or perioperative periods. The mean displacement distance of 11.64 mm was created, the mean value before spacer placement was 0.28 mm (P < 0.0001). The change of the prostate diameters showed a positive increase in all directions, with no significant negative change in any one direction. Regarding the change in distance between pubic symphysis and the prostate, no significant shortening trend was observed between the two groups (P = 0.14). Whereas the dosimetric parameters showed means of 0.001 and 0.026 cc for RV150 and RV100 in the spacer group, they were 0.025 and 0.318 cc, respectively, in the non-spacer group, showing a significant decrease in both parameters (P < 0.001).  Conclusions:   Prostate deformation secondary to hydrogel placement might adversely affect dosimetric parameters in patients undergoing low-dose-rate brachytherapy.

Sampling schedules for estimating the necessary time-integrated activity coefficients (TIACs) are not optimized and standardized for clinical practice. Therefore, a simulation study to determine optimal sampling schedules (OSSs) was performed on 13 virtual 177 Lu-PSMA I&T therapy patients.  Method:   A total of 880 clinically feasible sampling schedules for planar imaging (three time points) were investigated. To simulate the hybrid planar/SPECT method, an additional quantitative SPECT/CT measurement following one planar image was considered. For each sampling schedule and patient, the activity values were generated separately. Measurement noise was modeled by drawing random numbers of log-normal distributions. The used fractional standard deviations (FSD) differed depending on the imaging modality. For activity values assigned to planar imaging, systematic noise between 25% and 75% of the total noise was simulated. After fitting with a mono-exponential function, the root-mean-squared errors of the deviations of the simulated TIACs from the ground truth for 1000 replications were used to determine the OSS. The uncertainties of the TIACs and renal dose coefficients were estimated.  Results:   For the hybrid planar/SPECT method, OSSs were determined to be (3-4, 72-76, 124-144) h post injection (p.i.) with the quantitative SPECT/CT scan shortly after the second measurement. The accuracy and precision of the determined TIACs were in the range of (-3.0 ± 6.2)% and (-1.0 ± 6.5)%. This precision was improved by a factor 2-3 compared to dosimetry based on planar images only. Similar results were obtained for the renal dose coefficients. The virtual patients' renal dose coefficients were (0.68 ± 0.24) Gy/GBq indicating that a population-based method yields an uncertainty of 35%.  Conclusions:   Dosimetry based on the hybrid planar/SPECT method with OSS outperforms dosimetry based on planar images. The high variability in dose coefficients between the virtual patients demonstrates the need for individualized dosimetry.""","""['Andreas Rinscheid', 'Peter Kletting', 'Matthias Eiber', 'Ambros J Beer', 'Gerhard Glatting']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Influence of sampling schedules on 177LuLu-PSMA dosimetry.', 'Application of machine learning to pretherapeutically estimate dosimetry in men with advanced prostate cancer treated with 177Lu-PSMA I&T therapy.', 'First-in-human study of 177Lu-EB-PSMA-617 in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Radiation Dosimetry in 177Lu-PSMA-617 Therapy.', 'Therapeutic Responses and Survival Effects of 177Lu-PSMA-617 Radioligand Therapy in Metastatic Castrate-Resistant Prostate Cancer: A Meta-analysis.', 'Accuracy and uncertainty analysis of reduced time point imaging effect on time-integrated activity for 177Lu-DOTATATE PRRT in patients and clinically realistic simulations.', 'Accuracy and uncertainty analysis of reduced time point imaging effect on time-integrated activity for 177Lu-DOTATATE PRRT in clinical patients and realistic simulations.', 'Investigation of image-based lesion and kidney dosimetry protocols for 177Lu-PSMA-I&T therapy with and without a late SPECT/CT acquisition.', 'EANM dosimetry committee recommendations for dosimetry of 177Lu-labelled somatostatin-receptor- and PSMA-targeting ligands.', 'A Novel Time-Activity Information-Sharing Approach Using Nonlinear Mixed Models for Patient-Specific Dosimetry with Reduced Imaging Time Points: Application in SPECT/CT After 177Lu-DOTATATE.']"""

This study investigates the required modeling of robot and multileaf collimator (MLC) motion between control points in the trajectory and then uses this to develop an optimization method for treatment planning of a dynamic arc with Cyberknife. The resulting plans are compared in terms of dose-volume histograms and estimated treatment times with those produced by a conventional beam arrangement.  Methods:   Five SBRT patient cases (prostate A - conventional, prostate B - brachytherapy-type, lung, liver, and partial left breast) were retrospectively studied. A suitable arc trajectory with control points spaced at 5° was proposed and treatment plans were produced for typical clinical protocols. The optimization consisted of a fluence optimization, segmentation, and direct aperture optimization using a gradient descent method. Dose delivered by the moving MLC was either taken to be the dose delivered discretely at the control points or modeled using effective fluence delivered between control points. The accuracy of calculated dose was assessed by recalculating after optimization using five interpolated beams and 100 interpolated apertures between each optimization control point. The resulting plans were compared using dose-volume histograms and estimated treatment times with those for a conventional Cyberknife beam arrangement.  Results:   If optimization is performed based on discrete doses delivered at the arc control points, large differences of up to 40% of the prescribed dose are seen when recalculating with interpolation. When the effective fluence between control points is taken into account during optimization, dosimetric differences are <2% for most structures when the plans are recalculated using intermediate nodes, but there are differences of up to 15% peripherally. Treatment plan quality is comparable between the arc trajectory and conventional body path. All plans meet the relevant clinical goals, with the exception of specific structures which overlap with the planning target volume. Median estimated treatment time is 355 s (range 235-672 s) for arc delivery and 675 s (range 554-1025 s) for conventional delivery.  Conclusions:   The method of using effective fluence to model MLC motion between control points is sufficiently accurate to provide for accurate inverse planning of dynamic arcs with Cyberknife. The proposed arcing method produces treatment plans with comparable quality to the body path, with reduced estimated treatment delivery time.""","""['James L Bedford', 'Henry S Tsang', 'Simeon Nill', 'Uwe Oelfke']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Dosimetric accuracy of delivering SBRT using dynamic arcs on Cyberknife.', 'Inverse-planned deliverable 4D-IMRT for lung SBRT.', 'Intra-arc binary collimation with dynamic axes trajectory optimization for the SRS treatment of multiple metastases with multiple prescriptions.', 'The gimbaled-head radiotherapy system: Rise and downfall of a dedicated system for dynamic tumor tracking with real-time monitoring and dynamic WaveArc.', 'Robustness Analysis for External Beam Radiation Therapy Treatment Plans: Describing Uncertainty Scenarios and Reporting Their Dosimetric Consequences.', 'Dosimetric accuracy of delivering SBRT using dynamic arcs on Cyberknife.']"""

In this cancer, the stem cell transcription factor SOX2 increases during tumor progression, especially as the cancer progresses to the highly aggressive neuroendocrine-like phenotype. Other studies have shown that knockdown of RB1 and TP53 increases the expression of neuroendocrine markers, decreases the sensitivity to enzalutamide, and increases the expression of SOX2. Importantly, knockdown of SOX2 in the context of RB1 and TP53 depletion restored sensitivity to enzalutamide and reduced the expression of neuroendocrine markers. In this study, we examined whether elevating SOX2 is not only necessary, but also sufficient on its own to promote the expression of neuroendocrine markers and confer enzalutamide resistance. For this purpose, we engineered LNCaP cells for inducible overexpression of SOX2 (i-SOX2-LNCaP). As shown previously for other tumor cell types, inducible elevation of SOX2 in i-SOX2-LNCaP inhibited cell proliferation. SOX2 elevation also increased the expression of several neuroendocrine markers, including several neuropeptides and synaptophysin. However, SOX2 elevation did not decrease the sensitivity of i-SOX2-LNCaP cells to enzalutamide, which indicates that elevating SOX2 on its own is not sufficient to confer enzalutamide resistance. Furthermore, knocking down SOX2 in C4-2B cells, a derivative of LNCaP cells which is far less sensitive to enzalutamide and which expresses much higher levels of SOX2 than LNCaP cells, did not alter the growth response to this antiandrogen. Thus, our studies indicate that NE marker expression can increase independently of the sensitivity to enzalutamide.""","""['Ethan P Metz', 'Phillip J Wilder', 'Jixin Dong', 'Kaustubh Datta', 'Angie Rizzino']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""J Cell Physiol""","""['Sox2 is an androgen receptor-repressed gene that promotes castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Establishment of enzalutamide-resistant human prostate cancer cell lines and screening of lncRNA and mRNA expression profiles.', 'NF-κB2/p52 induces resistance to enzalutamide in prostate cancer: role of androgen receptor and its variants.', 'ADT with antiandrogens in prostate cancer induces adverse effect of increasing resistance, neuroendocrine differentiation and tumor metastasis.', 'Androgen receptor-related micro RNAs in prostate cancer and their role in antiandrogen drug resistance.', 'Targeting ITGB4/SOX2-driven lung cancer stem cells using proteasome inhibitors.', 'Role of transcription factors and chromatin modifiers in driving lineage reprogramming in treatment-induced neuroendocrine prostate cancer.', 'The driver role of JAK-STAT signalling in cancer stemness capabilities leading to new therapeutic strategies for therapy- and castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Elevating SOX2 Downregulates MYC through a SOX2:MYC Signaling Axis and Induces a Slowly Cycling Proliferative State in Human Tumor Cells.', 'Aggressive variants of prostate cancer: underlying mechanisms of neuroendocrine transdifferentiation.']"""

Methods:   All consecutive 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT scans routinely performed at our institution during more than 4 years were retrospectively screened for inclusion. We included mCRPC patients with a baseline PSMA PET/CT performed less than 2 months before the start of either enzalutamide or abiraterone, and a follow-up PSMA PET/CT performed no more than a year after, while still under those novel antiandrogen drugs (NAD). The associated clinical records were reviewed. Patients were considered treatment responders if they presented decreasing PSA levels > 50% or a radiological response based on RECIST 1.1 criteria. PSMA expression changes on the follow-up PET/CT were assessed using per-patient dominant response criteria to classify patients as PSMA-responders (complete disappearance of pathologic PSMA uptake, or a decreased uptake of the majority of lesions) or PSMA-non-responders (new PSMA-expressing lesions, increased uptake of the majority of lesions, or stable PSMA expression of the disease). Descriptive statistics and measures of associations (two-sided Fisher's exact test and Phi coefficient) were calculated.  Results:   A total of 11 and 15 patients were included in the enzalutamide and abiraterone groups. Median follow-up was 110 (IQR 76-124) and 87 (IQR 71-242) days, respectively. All treatment responders (3 enzalutamide and 4 abiraterone) were considered PSMA-responders, and all treatment non-responders (8 enzalutamide, 11 abiraterone) were considered PSMA-non-responders. PSMA PET response was thus perfectly associated with conventional response criteria (p = 0.006, Phi = 1 for enzalutamide; p = 0.001, Phi = 1 for abiraterone). In our cohort, no PSMA expression flare phenomenon was detected on follow-up PET/CT scans at a median follow-up of 3 months. However, an early and short-lived flare cannot be excluded.  Conclusions:   This retrospective study suggests that, after a median follow-up of 3 months under enzalutamide or abiraterone, PSMA expression changes on PET/CT are strongly associated with response to treatment. Prospective studies are needed to better understand PSMA expression dynamics following the start of enzalutamide and abiraterone, along with the role of PSMA PET/CT in response assessment.""","""['Nicolas Plouznikoff', 'Carlos Artigas', 'Spyridon Sideris', 'Nieves Martinez Chanza', 'Thierry Gil', 'Alexandre Peltier', 'Patrick Flamen']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Ann Nucl Med""","""['Prognostic value of 18F-choline PET/CT metabolic parameters in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer treated with abiraterone or enzalutamide.', 'Heterogeneous Flare in Prostate-specific Membrane Antigen Positron Emission Tomography Tracer Uptake with Initiation of Androgen Pathway Blockade in Metastatic Prostate Cancer.', 'Enzalutamide Enhances PSMA Expression of PSMA-Low Prostate Cancer.', 'Germline DNA-repair Gene Mutations and Efficacy of Abiraterone or Enzalutamide in Patients with Metastatic Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'What do we know about treatment sequencing of abiraterone, enzalutamide, and chemotherapy in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer?', 'Quantitative assessment of PSMA PET response to therapy in castration-sensitive prostate cancer using an automated imaging platform for disease identification and measurement.', 'Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen Expression on PET/CT in Patients with Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer: A Retrospective Observational Study.', 'PSMA PET/CT: joint EANM procedure guideline/SNMMI procedure standard for prostate cancer imaging 2.0.', 'Prostate specific membrane antigen binding radiopharmaceuticals: Current data and new concepts.', 'The impact of locoregional treatments for metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer on disease progression: real life experience from a multicenter cohort.']"""

Although corticosteroids have been associated with adverse events, long-term outcomes related to their sustained use have not been assessed in men with CRPC.  Objective:   This study evaluated the impact of cumulative corticosteroid exposure on the risk of developing specific adverse events in men with CRPC.  Methods:   Data were obtained from administrative claims databases. Adult chemotherapy-naïve men who initiated CRPC treatment following surgical or medical castration were selected. Patients were grouped into four cohorts based on cumulative corticosteroid dose: no exposure, low exposure (< 0.5 g), medium exposure (0.5-2.0 g), and high exposure (> 2.0 g). Time to each adverse event was assessed using Kaplan-Meier analyses and time-dependent Cox proportional hazard models, adjusting for baseline characteristics.  Results:   Overall, 9425 patients were included (no exposure, N = 6765; low exposure, N = 1660; medium exposure, N = 655; high exposure, N = 345). The mean age was 71-76 years across cohorts. During the study period, cumulative corticosteroid exposure was associated with a significantly higher risk of developing an infection [high vs. no exposure, adjusted hazard ratio (HR) 2.55; 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.27-2.85; p < 0.001 for trend], peptic ulcer (HR 1.91; 95% CI 1.39-2.64; p < 0.001), acute cardiovascular events (HR 1.62; 95% CI 1.43-1.83; p < 0.001), endocrine disorder (HR 1.61; 95% CI 1.34-1.94; p < 0.001), fracture (HR 1.59; 95% CI 1.37-1.86; p < 0.001), or mental health condition (HR 1.28; 95% CI 1.06-1.55; p = 0.014). Exposure to corticosteroids was associated with a more rapid onset of adverse events.

We compared the continence outcomes, surgical margin rates, and BCR risk of BNS vs. bladder neck reconstruction (BNR) patients during RALP.  Methods:   Overall, 1,512 patients who underwent RALP with BNS or BNR between 2010 and 2017 in a single high-volume center, were identified. Logistic regression models tested the effect of BNS on continence and surgical margin rates. Cox regression models tested the effect of BNS on BCR. Continence was defined as the use of 0 or 1-safety pad per day.  Results:   Three hundred and eighty-two vs. 1,130 patients underwent BNS vs. BNR. The median time to catheter removal was significantly shorter (5 vs. 8 days) in patients with BNS. Pad-free rates at 7 days after catheter removal were 60.0% vs. 54.5%, continence rates were 80.1% vs. 78.3% after 3 months and 85.3% vs. 89.6% after 1 year for BNS and BNR, respectively. Multivariable models revealed that BNS is an independent predictor to be pad-free at 7 days after catheter removal (OR: 1.39, P = 0.04), but no predictor for continence at 3 months (OR: 1.02, P = 0.9) and 1 year (OR: 0.78, P = 0.4) after RALP, as well as for positive surgical margin (OR: 0.95, P = 0.8) and BCR (Hazard ratio: 0.95, P = 0.9).  Conclusion:   Patients with BNS had a better chance to be pad-free at 7 days after catheter removal and had a significant shorter time to catheter removal. However, this beneficial effect disappeared with time and no differences in continence rates at 3 months and 1 year were recorded. Moreover, BNS did not negatively affect positive margin or BCR rates.""","""['Felix Preisser', 'Luis Busto Martin', 'Raisa S Pompe', 'Alexander Heinze', 'Alexander Haese', 'Markus Graefen', 'Derya Tilki']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Urol Oncol""","""['Retzius-sparing versus standard robotic-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy for the treatment of clinically localized prostate cancer.', 'Continence outcomes after bladder neck preservation during robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy (RALP).', 'Early return of continence in patients undergoing robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy using modified maximal urethral length preservation technique.', 'Posterior musculofascial reconstruction in robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy for the treatment of clinically localised prostate cancer: a Cochrane Review.', 'Robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy.', 'Analysis of radioactive implant migration in patients treated with iodine-125 seeds for permanent prostate brachytherapy with MRI-classified median lobe hyperplasia.', 'Biochemical recurrence of pathological T2+ localized prostate cancer after robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy: A 10-year surveillance.']"""

The objective of this study was to evaluate an automated bone scan index (aBSI) as a quantitative assessment of bone scans for radiographic response in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). Methods: In a multicenter retrospective study, bone scans from patients with mCRPC treated with monthly injections of 223Ra were collected from 7 hospitals in Sweden. Patients with available bone scans before treatment with 223Ra and at treatment discontinuation were eligible for the study. The aBSI was generated at baseline and at treatment discontinuation. The Spearman rank correlation was used to correlate aBSI with the baseline covariates: alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and prostate-specific antigen (PSA). The Cox proportional-hazards model and Kaplan-Meier curve were used to evaluate the association of covariates at baseline and their change at treatment discontinuation with overall survival (OS). The concordance index (C-index) was used to evaluate the discriminating strength of covariates in predicting OS. Results: Bone scan images at baseline were available from 156 patients, and 67 patients had both a baseline and a treatment discontinuation bone scan (median, 5 doses; interquartile range, 3-6 doses). Baseline aBSI (median, 4.5; interquartile range, 2.4-6.5) was moderately correlated with ALP (r = 0.60, P < 0.0001) and with PSA (r = 0.38, P = 0.003). Among baseline covariates, aBSI (P = 0.01) and ALP (P = 0.001) were significantly associated with OS, whereas PSA values were not (P = 0.059). After treatment discontinuation, 36% (24/67), 80% (54/67), and 13% (9/67) of patients demonstrated a decline in aBSI, ALP, and PSA, respectively. As a continuous variable, the relative change in aBSI after treatment, compared with baseline, was significantly associated with OS (P < 0.0001), with a C-index of 0.67. Median OS in patients with both aBSI and ALP decline (median, 134 wk) was significantly longer than in patients with ALP decline only (median, 77 wk; P = 0.029). Conclusion: Both aBSI at baseline and its change at treatment discontinuation were significant parameters associated with OS.

This study aimed to explore how ED in patients with PCa is managed in real-life clinical practice, from the perspective of patients and healthcare professionals (HCPs).  Design and setting:   This is a UK-wide cross-sectional survey of men with ED after treatment for PCa which covered assessment and discussion of erectile function, provision of supportive care and satisfaction with management. Parallel surveys of primary and secondary HCPs were also conducted.  Results:   Responses were received from 546 men with ED after PCa treatment, 167 primary (general practitioners and practice nurses) and 94 secondary care HCPs (urologists and urology clinical nurse specialists). Survey findings revealed inadequate management of ED in primary care, particularly underprescribing of effective management options. A fifth of men (21%) were not offered any ED management, and a similar proportion (23%) were not satisfied with the way HCPs addressed their ED concerns. There was poor communication between HCPs and men, including failure to initiate discussions about ED and/or involve partners, with 12% of men not told that ED was a risk factor of PCa treatment. These issues seemed to reflect poor access to effective ED management or services and lack of primary HCP confidence in managing ED, as well as confusion over the roles and responsibilities among both HCPs and men.  Conclusions:   This study confirms the need for better support for men from HCPs and more tailored and timely access to effective ED management after treatment for PCa. A clearly defined pathway is required for the discussion and management of ED, starting from the planning stage of PCa treatment. Improved adherence to ED management guidelines and better education and training for primary care HCPs are areas of priority.""","""['Amy Dyer', 'Mike Kirby', 'Isabel D White', 'Alison Michelle Cooper']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""BMJ Open""","""[""Does management of erectile dysfunction after radical prostatectomy meet patients' expectations?

Materials and methods:   Six MR-guided prostate SBRT treatment courses were simulated using volumetric OAR (bladder and rectum) information derived from actual patient data. Deformed OAR contours, geometrical landmarks and GafChromic EBT3 film strips (1.25 × 2.0 cm2) placed at the surface of the OARs were used to validate DIR-based dose accumulation in MRgRT. Two DIR methods were applied: an intensity-based deformation (IB-D) applied to the whole image, and a contour-based deformation (CB-D), resulting in a separate deformation and dose accumulation for each OAR. Dosimetric accuracy was evaluated by quantifying the dose differences, and performing a gamma-index analysis between measured and DIR-derived accumulated dose for both OARs. Geometrical accuracy was assessed by measuring the Dice similarity coefficient (DSC), Hausdorff distance (HDD) and residual distance error (RDE) for all markers at each fraction.  Results:   CB-D resulted in an average dose deviation from film measurements for rectum and bladder surfaces of 0.6% and 0.3%, respectively. IB-D led to worse results resulting in an overall average dose accumulation inaccuracy of 7.2% and 2.5% for rectum and bladder. CB-D also showed a higher geometrical accuracy than IB-D with significantly higher DSC values and lower RDE and HDD deviations.

However, the genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic relationship between conventional urothelial and synchronous sarcomatoid morphology is poorly defined.  Methods:   We compiled a cohort of 21 MIBC patients with components of conventional urothelial and adjacent sarcomatoid morphology within the same tumor focus. We performed comprehensive pathologic and immunohistochemical characterization and in 4 selected cases, subjected both morphologic components to targeted DNA sequencing and whole transcriptome analysis.  Results:   Synchronous sarcomatoid and urothelial morphology from the same MIBC foci shared truncal somatic mutations, indicating a common ancestral clone. However, additional mutations or copy number alterations restricted to the either component suggested divergent evolution at the genomic level. This was confirmed at the transcriptome level since while the urothelial component exhibited a basal-like subtype (TCGA2014: cluster III, LundTax: basal/squamous-like), the sarcomatoid morphology was predominantly cluster IV (claudin-low). Protein expression was consistent with a basal-like phenotype in both morphologies in 18/21 of cases. However, most cases had evidence of active epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (E-Cad ↓ and Zeb1 or TWIST1 ↑) from urothelial toward the sarcomatoid morphology. Drug response signatures nominated different targets for each morphology and proposed agents under clinical investigation in liposarcoma or other sarcoma. PD-L1 expression was higher in the sarcomatoid than the urothelial component.  Conclusions:   Conventional urothelial and adjacent sarcomatoid morphologies of MIBC arise from the same common ancestor and share a basal-like phenotype.

We examined the risk of chronic opioid use following radical prostatectomy using nationwide Swedish data.  Materials and methods:   A total of 25,703 men in the National Prostate Cancer Register of Sweden who underwent radical prostatectomy were linked to the Prescribed Drug Register. Opioid use was assessed at 3 times, including baseline (13 months to 1 month preoperatively), perioperatively (1 month before and after) and postoperatively (1 to 12 months). Multivariable logistic regression was done to identify predictors of new late use (1 or more opioid prescriptions in 3 consecutive months more than 2 months after surgery).  Results:   Overall 16,368 men (64%) filled an opioid prescription during the 13 months before or after surgery. The use of strong opioids increased with time and the use of weak opioids decreased. Of the men 1.9% had opioid prescriptions during the baseline period, followed by a spike to 59% around the time surgery, which sharply decreased in month 2 postoperatively. However, thereafter the proportion of men with opioid prescriptions remained slightly higher at 2.2% compared to the baseline before radical prostatectomy. Of chronic late users 57% were previous users and 43% were new chronic users. Higher cancer risk category, greater comorbidity, unmarried status and low educational level were associated with the risk of new chronic opioid use.  Conclusions:   Slightly more than half of male Swedish patients filled an opioid prescription after radical prostatectomy and less than 1% became chronic opioid users.

In a tumor with pattern 3 and less than 5% pattern 4, of the 95 respondents, 35 (37%) assigned 3 + 3 = 6 with TP4, while 56 (59%) assigned 3 + 4 = 7. In a tumor with pattern 4 and less than 5% pattern 5, of the 95 respondents, 51 (54%) assigned 4 + 4 = 8 with TP5, while 43 (45%) assigned 4 + 5 = 9. Six scenarios were presented in which the order of most common patterns was 3, 4, and 5 (Group 1) or 4, 3, and 5 (Group 2) with varying percentages. In both groups, when pattern 5 was less than 5%, we found that 98% and 93% of respondents would assign 3 + 4 = 7 or 4 + 3 = 7 with TP5. In scenarios with 15% or 25% pattern 5, most respondents (70% and 80%, respectively) would include pattern 5 as the secondary grade, that is, 3 + 5 = 8 (Group 1) or 4 + 5 = 9 (Group 2). For 85 of 95 (89%), a TP would not impact Grade Group assignment.  Conclusions.—:   This survey highlights substantial variation in practice patterns regarding definition and application of ""tertiary"" grading in radical prostatectomy specimens. High consistency was observed in 3 + 4 = 7/4 + 3 = 7 scenarios with truly minor pattern 5. These findings should inform future studies assessing the standardization and predictive value of ""tertiary"" patterns.""","""['Samson W Fine', 'Debra L Meisels', 'Andrew J Vickers', 'Hikmat Al-Ahmadie', 'Ying-Bei Chen', 'Anuradha Gopalan', 'S Joseph Sirintrapun', 'Satish K Tickoo', 'Victor E Reuter']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Arch Pathol Lab Med""","""['Contemporary Gleason Grading of Prostatic Carcinoma: An Update With Discussion on Practical Issues to Implement the 2014 International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) Consensus Conference on Gleason Grading of Prostatic Carcinoma.', 'Predicting biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy: the role of prognostic grade group and index tumor nodule.', 'Integrating Tertiary Gleason 5 Patterns into Quantitative Gleason Grading in Prostate Biopsies and Prostatectomy Specimens.', 'Reporting Practices and Resource Utilization in the Era of Intraductal Carcinoma of the Prostate: A Survey of Genitourinary Subspecialists.', 'The 2014 International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) Consensus Conference on Gleason Grading of Prostatic Carcinoma: Definition of Grading Patterns and Proposal for a New Grading System.', 'Diagnostic significance of reassessment of prostate biopsy specimens by experienced urological pathologists at a high-volume institution.']"""

In this study, we aim to determine the intra- and interobserver agreement levels of Ga- prostate-specific membrane antigen-I&T positron emission tomography/computed tomography according to molecular imaging tumor-lymph node-metastases reporting system.  Materials and methods:   Eighty prostate cancer patients and underwent Ga- prostate-specific membrane antigen positron emission tomography/computed tomography were blindly evaluated twice by four nuclear medicine specialists at intervals of 4 weeks. The evaluations were performed according to molecular imaging tumour-lymph node-metastases (miTNM) classification.

This phenomenon is poorly understood. This study employs two breast and two prostate cancer cell lines to investigate the role of protein kinase CK2 in regulating zinc homeostasis. CK2 was targeted by its specific inhibitors 4,5,6,7-tetrabromobenzotriazole (TBB) and CX-4945, and by the specific siRNA against each of the three CK2 genes. The effect of zinc exposure after the above CK2 manipulation was observed by MTT [3-(4,5-dimethyliazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide] cell viability assay and confocal microscopy for intracellular zinc level. The results demonstrate that CK2 is involved in regulating zinc homeostasis in breast and prostate cancer cells as both TBB and CX-4945 substantially decreased cell viability upon zinc exposure. siRNA-mediated knockdown of the three CK2 subunits (α, α' and β) revealed their discrete roles in regulating zinc homeostasis in breast and prostate cancer cells.

The ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related (ATR) kinase plays a central role in the DDR by activating essential signaling pathways of DNA damage repair. Here, we studied the effect of the novel selective ATR kinase inhibitor BAY 1895344 on tumor cell growth and viability. Potent antiproliferative activity was demonstrated in a broad spectrum of human tumor cell lines. BAY 1895344 exhibited strong monotherapy efficacy in cancer xenograft models that carry DNA damage repair deficiencies. The combination of BAY 1895344 with DNA damage-inducing chemotherapy or external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) showed synergistic antitumor activity. Combination treatment with BAY 1895344 and DDR inhibitors achieved strong synergistic antiproliferative activity in vitro, and combined inhibition of ATR and PARP signaling using olaparib demonstrated synergistic antitumor activity in vivo Furthermore, the combination of BAY 1895344 with the novel, nonsteroidal androgen receptor antagonist darolutamide resulted in significantly improved antitumor efficacy compared with respective single-agent treatments in hormone-dependent prostate cancer, and addition of EBRT resulted in even further enhanced antitumor efficacy.

It had heretofore not been possible to selectively inhibit cancer cell motility. Our group has recently shown that inhibition of intracellular activation of Raf1 with the small-molecule therapeutic KBU2046 permits, for the first time, selective inhibition of cell motility. We hypothesized that simultaneous disruption of multiple distinct functions that drive progression of prostate cancer to induce death would result in advanced disease control. Using a murine orthotopic implantation model of human prostate cancer metastasis, we demonstrate that combined treatment with KBU2046 and docetaxel retains docetaxel's antitumor action, but provides improved inhibition of metastasis, compared with monotherapy. KBU2046 does not interfere with hormone therapy, inclusive of enzalutamide-mediated inhibition of androgen receptor (AR) function and cell growth inhibition, and inclusive of the ability of castration to inhibit LNCaP-AR cell outgrowth in mice. Cell movement is necessary for osteoclast-mediated bone degradation. KBU2046 inhibits Raf1 and its downstream activation of MEK1/2 and ERK1/2 in osteoclasts, inhibiting cytoskeleton rearrangement, resorptive cavity formation, and bone destruction in vitro, with improved effects observed when the bone microenvironment is chemically modified by pretreatment with zoledronic acid. Using a murine cardiac injection model of human prostate cancer bone destruction quantified by CT, KBU2046 plus zoledronic exhibit improved inhibitory efficacy, compared with monotherapy.

Approximately 35% of PCa recurs and is often transformed to castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPCa), the most deadly and aggressive form of PCa. However, the CRPCa standard-of-care treatment (enzalutamide with abiraterone) usually has limited efficacy. Herein, we report a novel molecule (PAWI-2) that inhibits cellular proliferation of androgen-sensitive and androgen-insensitive cells (LNCaP and PC-3, respectively). In vivo studies in a PC-3 xenograft model showed that PAWI-2 (20 mg/kg per day i.p., 21 days) inhibited tumor growth by 49% compared with vehicle-treated mice. PAWI-2 synergized currently clinically used enzalutamide in in vitro inhibition of PCa cell viability and resensitized inhibition of in vivo PC-3 tumor growth. Compared with vehicle-treated mice, PC-3 xenograft studies also showed that PAWI-2 (20 mg/kg per day i.p., 21 days) and enzalutamide (5 mg/kg per day i.p., 21 days) inhibited tumor growth by 63%. Synergism was mainly controlled by the imbalance of prosurvival factors (e.g., Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, Mcl-1) and antisurvival factors (e.g., Bax, Bak) induced by affecting mitochondrial membrane potential/mitochondria dynamics. Thus, PAWI-2 utilizes a distinct mechanism of action to inhibit PCa growth independently of androgen receptor signaling and overcomes enzalutamide-resistant CRPCa. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPCa) is the most aggressive human prostate cancer (PCa) but standard chemotherapies for CRPCa are largely ineffective. PAWI-2 potently inhibits PCa proliferation in vitro and in vivo regardless of androgen receptor status and uses a distinct mechanism of action. PAWI-2 has greater utility in treating CRPCa than standard-of-care therapy. PAWI-2 possesses promising therapeutic potency in low-dose combination therapy with a clinically used drug (e.g., enzalutamide). This study describes a new approach to address the overarching challenge in clinical treatment of CRPCa.""","""['Jiongjia Cheng', 'Stephanie Moore', 'Jorge Gomez-Galeno', 'Dong-Hoon Lee', 'Karl J Okolotowicz', 'John R Cashman']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""J Pharmacol Exp Ther""","""['Inhibition of noncanonical Wnt pathway overcomes enzalutamide resistance in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Antitumor Activity of the IGF-1/IGF-2-Neutralizing Antibody Xentuzumab (BI 836845) in Combination with Enzalutamide in Prostate Cancer Models.', 'A novel androgen receptor antagonist JJ-450 inhibits enzalutamide-resistant mutant ARF876L nuclear import and function.', 'The role of drug-drug interactions in prostate cancer treatment: Focus on abiraterone acetate/prednisone and enzalutamide.', 'Prostate cancer: Therapeutic prospect with herbal medicine.', 'Mitochondrial metabolism: a predictive biomarker of radiotherapy efficacy and toxicity.', 'PPFIA4 promotes castration-resistant prostate cancer by enhancing mitochondrial metabolism through MTHFD2.', 'Hydralazine and Enzalutamide: Synergistic Partners against Prostate Cancer.', 'Pancreatic cancer drug-sensitivity predicted by synergy of p53-Activator Wnt Inhibitor-2 (PAWI-2) and protein biomarker expression.', 'A highly efficient non-viral process for programming mesenchymal stem cells for gene directed enzyme prodrug cancer therapy.']"""

Here, we showed that protein isoforms of mitochondrial fission factor (MFF1 and MFF2), a molecule that controls mitochondrial size and shape, that is, mitochondrial dynamics, were overexpressed in patients with non-small cell lung cancer and formed homo- and heterodimeric complexes with the voltage-dependent anion channel-1 (VDAC1), a key regulator of mitochondrial outer membrane permeability. MFF inserted into the interior hole of the VDAC1 ring using Arg225, Arg236, and Gln241 as key contact sites. A cell-permeable MFF Ser223-Leu243 d-enantiomeric peptidomimetic disrupted the MFF-VDAC1 complex, acutely depolarized mitochondria, and triggered cell death in heterogeneous tumor types, including drug-resistant melanoma, but had no effect on normal cells. In preclinical models, treatment with the MFF peptidomimetic was well-tolerated and demonstrated anticancer activity in patient-derived xenografts, primary breast and lung adenocarcinoma 3D organoids, and glioblastoma neurospheres. These data identify the MFF-VDAC1 complex as a novel regulator of mitochondrial cell death and an actionable therapeutic target in cancer.

Objective:   To show how image acquisition of prostate multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging (mpMRI) can be optimized.  Design, setting, and participants:   Image protocols, magnetic field strength choice, and the use of receiver coils are discussed. In addition, patient preparation and the recognition, prevention, and mitigation of artifacts are evaluated.  Surgical procedure:   Based on expert prostate MRI technologists (MRI radiographers) opinion, the optimal protocol is reviewed, and potential artifacts are determined.  Measurements:   The entire acquisition process is presented from initial patient preparation until the end of the imaging. The choice of the used equipment, pulse sequences, and prevention of patient- and imaging-related artifacts are presented. This will be shown in individual patients.  Results and limitations:   Although the Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System guidelines (2012 and 2016) describe minimal and optimal acquisition protocols for prostate mpMRI, these standards are not always met in daily practice. A major challenge in mpMRI is to obtain high image quality and reduce its variability for radiologic interpretations. A summary of evidence and guidelines for the acquisition of mpMRI of the prostate can set a basic guideline to reduce these variabilities.  Conclusions:   This article and an accompanying video can be used as a guide by MRI technologists (MRI radiographers) to improve their image acquisitions by optimizing protocols, magnetic field strength choice, and use of receiver coils. We also discuss patient preparation and the recognition, prevention, and mitigation of artifacts.  Patient summary:   In this first surgery-in-motion contribution, we will show how optimized image acquisition is performed to detect prostate cancer.

However, the roles of MIEN1 in prostate cancer have not yet been clearly addressed. We determined the expression, biological functions, and regulatory mechanisms of MIEN1 in the prostate. The results of immunohistochemical analysis indicated that MIEN1 was expressed specifically in epithelial cells and significantly higher in adenocarcinoma as compared to in normal tissues. MIEN1 enhanced in vitro cell proliferation, invasion, and in vivo tumorigenesis. Meanwhile, MIEN1 attenuated cisplatin-induced apoptosis in PC-3 cells. Overexpression of NF-ĸB-inducing kinase (NIK) enhanced MIEN1 expression, while overexpression of NF-ĸB inhibitor α (IĸBα) blocked MIEN1 expression in PC-3 cells. In prostate carcinoma cells, MIEN1 provoked Akt phosphorylation; moreover, MIEN1 downregulated N-myc downstream regulated 1 (NDRG1) but upregulated interleukin-6 (IL-6) gene expression. MK2206, an Akt inhibitor, impeded the modulation of MIEN1 on NDRG1 and IL-6 expressions. Our studies suggest that MIEN1 is an NF-ĸB downstream oncogene in the human prostate. Accordingly, the modulation of Akt signaling in the gene expressions of NDRG1 and IL-6 may account for the functions of MIEN1 in cell proliferation, invasion, and tumorigenesis in prostate carcinoma cells.""","""['Kang-Shuo Chang', 'Ke-Hung Tsui', 'Yu-Hsiang Lin', 'Chen-Pang Hou', 'Tsui-Hsia Feng', 'Horng-Heng Juang']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Cancers (Basel)""","""['MIEN1 promotes oral cancer progression and implicates poor overall survival.', 'MicroRNA-940 suppresses prostate cancer migration and invasion by regulating MIEN1.', 'Metallothionein 3: an androgen-upregulated gene enhances cell invasion and tumorigenesis of prostate carcinoma cells.', 'Emerging Role of Migration and Invasion Enhancer 1 (MIEN1) in Cancer Progression and Metastasis.', 'Molecular functions of the iron-regulated metastasis suppressor, NDRG1, and its potential as a molecular target for cancer therapy.', 'The Molecular Biology of Prostate Cancer Stem Cells: From the Past to the Future.', 'WNT1 Inducible Signaling Pathway Protein 1 Is a Stroma-Specific Secreting Protein Inducing a Fibroblast Contraction and Carcinoma Cell Growth in the Human Prostate.', 'The Antitumor Effect of Caffeic Acid Phenethyl Ester by Downregulating Mucosa-Associated Lymphoid Tissue 1 via AR/p53/NF-κB Signaling in Prostate Carcinoma Cells.', 'Mucosa-Associated Lymphoid Tissue 1 Is an Oncogene Inducing Cell Proliferation, Invasion, and Tumor Growth via the Upregulation of NF-κB Activity in Human Prostate Carcinoma Cells.', 'The HMGB1-2 Ovarian Cancer Interactome.

Despite its less satisfactory effects, chemotherapy is the most common treatment option for metastatic and/or castration-resistant patients. There are constant needs for novel anti-prostate cancer therapeutic/prevention agents. Curcumin, a known chemo-preventive agent, was shown to inhibit prostate cancer cell growth. This study aimed to unravel the inhibitory effect of curcumin in prostate cancer through analyzing the alterations of expressions of curcumin targeting genes clusters in androgen-dependent LNCaP cells and androgen-independent metastatic C4-2B cells. Hierarchical clustering showed the highest number of differentially expressed genes at 12 h post treatment in both cells, suggesting that the androgen-dependent/independent manner of curcumin impacts on prostate cancer cells. Evaluation of significantly regulated top canonical pathways highlighted that Transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β), Wingless-related integration site (Wnt), Phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Protein Kinase B/ mammalian target of rapamycin (PIK3/AKT(PKB)/mTOR), and nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-kB) signaling were primarily inhibited, and Phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) dependent cell cycle arrest and apoptosis pathways were elevated with curcumin treatment. The short term (3-24 h) and long term (48 h) effect of curcumin treatment revealed 31 and four genes modulated in both cell lines. TGF-β signaling, including the androgen/TGF-β inhibitor Prostate transmembrane protein androgen-induced 1 (PMEPA1), was the only pathway impacted by curcumin treatment after 48 h. Our findings also established that MYC Proto-Oncogene, basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) Transcription Factor (MYC) signaling was down-regulated in curcumin-treated cell lines.

The aim of our study was to investigate the relationship between enzalutamide and N-desmethyl enzalutamide exposure and treatment response in a real-world cohort of patients with mCRPC.  Design:   Retrospective, observational, pharmacokinetic study.  Setting:   Outpatient clinic at a tertiary cancer center in Amsterdam, the Netherlands.  Patients:   Sixty-five patients with mCRPC who were treated with enzalutamide 160 mg daily and had at least one steady-state enzalutamide plasma concentration between May 2015 and June 2018; of these patients, 38 were prostate-specific antigen (PSA) responders and 27 were nonresponders.  Measurements and main results:   Plasma concentrations, determined by using liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), were compared between PSA responders and nonresponders. Three clinical end points were evaluated separately in this study: PSA-independent progression-free survival (PFS), time to PSA progression (TTPP), and rate of PSA response (defined as ≥ 50% decrease in PSA level from baseline). Enzalutamide toxicity was defined as discontinuation due to adverse events, dose reductions due to adverse events, or temporary treatment interruption. For these analyses, plasma concentrations of enzalutamide and N-desmethyl enzalutamide were divided into quartiles. Mean ± SD plasma concentrations in the 65 patients were as follows: enzalutamide 11.2 ± 2.8 μg/ml, N-desmethyl enzalutamide 9.9 ± 2.9 μg/ml, and carboxylic acid enzalutamide 6.1 ± 4.3 μg/ml. Plasma concentrations were not significantly different in the PSA responder versus nonresponder groups for enzalutamide (11.5 vs 10.6 μg/ml, p=0.20), N-desmethyl enzalutamide (10.1 vs 9.6 μg/ml, p=0.48), and carboxylic acid enzalutamide (6.5 vs 5.5 μg/ml, p=0.34). Univariate and multivariate analyses did not show a relationship between plasma concentrations and PSA-independent PFS, TTPP, or toxicity.  Conclusion:   This study confirmed that enzalutamide plasma concentrations were not related to PSA-independent PFS, TTPP, or toxicity in patients with mCRPC, and demonstrated that plasma concentrations of its major metabolites were also not associated with treatment response. Based on these findings, there is no role for therapeutic drug monitoring of enzalutamide in patients with mCRPC in daily practice.""","""['Merel van Nuland', 'Andries M Bergman', 'Hilde Rosing', 'Niels de Vries', 'Alwin D R Huitema', 'Jos H Beijnen']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Pharmacotherapy""","""['Pharmacokinetic/Pharmacodynamic Relationship of Enzalutamide and Its Active Metabolite N-Desmethyl Enzalutamide in Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer Patients.', 'Effectiveness of first-line abiraterone versus enzalutamide among\xa0patients ≥80 years of age with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer: A retrospective propensity score-weighted comparative cohort study.', 'AR-V7 in Peripheral Whole Blood of Patients with Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer: Association with Treatment-specific Outcome Under Abiraterone and Enzalutamide.', 'Enzalutamide for the treatment of nonmetastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Enzalutamide: a review of its use in metastatic, castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Efficacy and safety exposure-response relationships of apalutamide in patients with metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer: results from the phase 3 TITAN study.', 'Precision Dosing of Targeted Therapies Is Ready for Prime Time.', 'Study to Compare Capsule and Liquid Formulations of Enzalutamide After Single-Dose Administration Under Fasting Conditions in Prostate Cancer.', 'Therapeutic drug monitoring of oral targeted antineoplastic drugs.']"""

The objective of this study was to assess the cost-effectiveness of adding a nonavalent new Gardasil-9® (9vHPV) vaccine to the national immunisation schedule in Australia across three different delivery strategies.  Materials and methods:   The Papillomavirus Rapid Interface for Modelling and Economics (PRIME) model was used to examine the cost-effectiveness of 9vHPV vaccine introduction to prevent HPV infection. Academic literature and anecdotal evidence were included on the demographic variables, cervical cancer incidence and mortality, treatment costs, and vaccine delivery costs. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were measured per disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) averted, using the heuristic cost-effectiveness threshold defined by the World Health Organisation (WHO). Analyses and data from international agencies were used in scenario analysis from the health system and societal perspectives.  Results:   The 9vHPV vaccination was estimated to prevent 113 new cases of cervical cancer (discounted) during a 20-year period. From the health system and societal perspectives, the 9vHPV vaccination was very cost-effective in comparison with the status quo, with an ICER of A$47,008 and A$44,678 per DALY averted, respectively, using the heuristic cost-effectiveness threshold level. Considering delivery strategies, the ICERs per DALY averted were A$47,605, A$46,682, and A$46,738 for school, health facilities, and outreach-based vaccination programs from the health system perspective, wherein, from the societal perspective, the ICERs per DALY averted were A$46,378, A$43,729, A$43,930, respectively. All estimates of ICERs fell below the threshold level (A$73,267).  Conclusions:   This cost-effectiveness evaluation suggests that the routine two-dose 9vHPV vaccination strategy of preadolescent girls against HPV is very cost-effective in Australia from both the health system and societal perspectives. If equally priced, the 9vHPV option is the most economically viable vaccine. Overall, this analysis seeks to contribute to an evidence-based recommendation about the new 9vHPV vaccination in the national immunisation program in Australia.""","""['Rashidul Alam Mahumud', 'Khorshed Alam', 'Jeff Dunn', 'Jeff Gow']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Cost-effectiveness of the introduction of two-dose bi-valent (Cervarix) and quadrivalent (Gardasil) HPV vaccination for adolescent girls in Bangladesh.', 'Public health impact and cost effectiveness of routine and catch-up vaccination of girls and women with a nine-valent HPV vaccine in Japan: a model-based study.', 'Cost-effectiveness and value-based prices of the 9-valent human papillomavirus vaccine for the prevention of cervical cancer in China: an economic modelling analysis.', 'Prophylaxis of cervical cancer and related cervical disease: a review of the cost-effectiveness of vaccination against oncogenic HPV types.', 'Expanded strain coverage for a highly successful public health tool: Prophylactic 9-valent human papillomavirus vaccine.', 'Accounting for Adverse Events Following Immunization in Economic Evaluation: Systematic Review of Economic Evaluations of Pediatric Vaccines Against Pneumococcus, Rotavirus, Human Papillomavirus, Meningococcus and Measles-Mumps-Rubella-Varicella.', 'Are intersectoral costs considered in economic evaluations of interventions relating to sexually transmitted infections (STIs)?

We first developed and analytically validated a novel multiplex RT-qPCR assay for AR full length (AR-FL), AR-V7, AR-567es and AR-total. We then quantified the expression levels of AR-splice variants, CK-19 (epithelial marker) and B2M (reference gene) in EpCAM+ CTCs, and paired plasma-derived extracellular vesicles isolated from peripheral blood (20 mL) of 62 mCRPC patients and 10 healthy donors. CTCs were enumerated using the FDA-cleared CellSearch® system. In CTCs AR-FL was detected in 64/69 (92.3%), AR-V7 in 34/69 (49.3%), AR-567es in 16/69 (23.2%) and AR-total in 62/69 (89.9%). In 52 out of 69 samples, paired plasma-derived extracellular vesicles were analyzed. AR-FL was detected in 40/52 (76.9%), AR-V7 in 4/52 (7.7%), AR-567 in 2/52 (3.8%) and AR total in 39/52 (75.0%). In all cases AR splice variants were expressed in higher levels in CTCs than in paired extracellular vesicles, while AR-V7 was detected in higher percentages than in AR-567es.

All patients have been treated up to 66.0-66.6 Gy in 1.8-2.0 Gy fractions. Predictive factors were analyzed at two stages, using a multivariable Cox regression analysis: (1) based on factors known before radiotherapy and (2) based on prostate-specific antigen response after radiotherapy.Results: Median follow-up after radiotherapy was 121 months. Prostate-specific antigen before radiotherapy, pN1 and Gleason score remained predictive factors for disease-free (hazard ratio, HR of 6.0, 2.3 and 2.5) and overall survival (HR of 2.8, 2.0 and 1.6) in multivariable analysis. Prostate-specific antigen levels increased despite radiotherapy in 27% of patients in the first six months. Failed response following salvage radiotherapy and prostate-specific antigen doubling time at the time of biochemical recurrence were predictive factors for disease-free (HR of 2.8 and 7.3; p < .01) and overall survival (HR of 2.2 and 2.6; p < .01).Conclusion: To reach the best survival outcomes following prostatectomy, salvage radiotherapy should be initiated early with low prostate-specific antigen levels, especially in patients with higher Gleason scores.

Therefore, this study aimed to explore the association between rs710886 SNP and the risk of endometriosis, as well as the effect of this SNP on the activation of the signaling pathway downstream of PCAT1. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed to observe the expression of miR-145 in transfected cells, while Matrigel invasion chamber assays and MTT assay were conducted to examine the invasiveness/proliferation among different cell groups. Moreover, bioinformatics tools, luciferase assays, real-time PCR, and Western blot analysis were used to measure the expression of these target genes in the presence of miR-145. Finally, a statistical analysis was conducted to compare the genotypes of rs710886 SNP between fertile healthy women and infertile women with endometriosis. PCAT1 small interfering RNA (siRNA) evidently increased the expression of miR-145 but reduced the invasiveness/proliferation of cells. P-PCAT1 exhibited an opposite effect as that of PCAT1 siRNA, indicating PCAT1 could promote the proliferation and invasiveness of endometriosis stem cells via inhibiting the expression of miR-145. Meanwhile, FASCIN1, SOX2, MSI2, SERPINE1, and JAM-A were identified as target genes of miR-145 via computational analysis and luciferase assays. Finally, a significant genetic effect was observed in both the dominant (AG+GG vs AA) and recessive models (GG vs AG+AA), indicating the presence of an association between the genotype of SNP rs710886 and the risk of endometriosis. SNP rs710886 A>G could lower the expression of PCAT1, thus leading to the overexpression of miR-145.

This study aimed to evaluate the expression of SATB2 in NNs from various primary sites and its utility as a marker in determining the site of origin of these neoplasms.  Methods and results:   SATB2 immunohistochemistry was performed on 266 NNs, including lung small cell carcinomas (n = 39) and carcinoids (n = 30), bladder (n = 21) and prostate (n = 31) small cell carcinomas, and gastrointestinal (GI)/pancreatic NNs of various primary sites (n = 145) consisting of well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumours (WDNET)s (n = 124) and poorly differentiated neuroendocrine carcinomas (PDNEC)s (n = 21). SATB2 was expressed in prostatic (10 of 31, 32%) and bladder (eight of 21, 38%) small cell carcinomas, lung carcinoid tumours (one of 30, 3%), and lung small cell carcinomas (eight of 39, 21%). Among primary GI NNs, SATB2 was expressed in 37 of 124 (30%) WDNETs and four of 21 (19%) PDNECs. Of the former, 15 of 15 (100%) rectal/rectosigmoid and 22 of 22 (100%) appendiceal neoplasms expressed SATB2. Using receiver operator characteristic analysis, SATB2 was a sensitive and specific marker for rectal (100.0%, 80.0%) and appendiceal (100.0%, 84.5%) WDNETs, respectively.  Conclusions:   In summary, SATB2 is a sensitive and specific marker for rectal/rectosigmoid and appendiceal WDNETs, and may represent a useful diagnostic tool when these sites of origin are considered in the differential diagnosis.""","""['Deepthi Hoskoppal', 'Jonathan I Epstein', 'Allen M Gown', 'Shanna A Arnold Egloff', 'Jennifer B Gordetsky', 'Chanjuan J Shi', 'Giovanna A Giannico']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Histopathology""","""['SATB2 in neuroendocrine neoplasms: strong expression is restricted to well-differentiated tumours of lower gastrointestinal tract origin and is most frequent in Merkel cell carcinoma among poorly differentiated carcinomas.', 'SATB2 Expression Distinguishes Ovarian Metastases of Colorectal and Appendiceal Origin From Primary Ovarian Tumors of Mucinous or Endometrioid Type.', 'Positivity for SATB2 distinguishes Islet1 positive rectal neuroendocrine tumours from pancreaticoduodenal neuroendocrine tumours.', 'SATB2 as an Immunohistochemical Marker for Colorectal Adenocarcinoma: A Concise Review of Benefits and Pitfalls.', 'Assigning site of origin in metastatic neuroendocrine neoplasms: a clinically significant application of diagnostic immunohistochemistry.', 'microRNA-660 Enhances Cisplatin Sensitivity via Decreasing SATB2 Expression in Lung Adenocarcinoma.', ""Transcription Factor Expression in Sinonasal Neuroendocrine Neoplasms and Olfactory Neuroblastoma (ONB): Hyams' Grades 1-3 ONBs Expand the Spectrum of SATB2 and GATA3-Positive Neoplasms."", 'Overview of the 2022 WHO Classification of Neuroendocrine Neoplasms.', 'Ductal breast carcinoma metastasized to the rectum: A case report and review of the literature.', 'SATB2 is a novel biomarker and therapeutic target for cancer.']"""

PGC1A downregulation in prostate cancer is causally associated with the development of metastasis. Here we show that the transcriptional complex formed by PGC1α and estrogen-related receptor 1 alpha (ERRα) controls the aggressive properties of prostate cancer cells. PGC1α expression significantly decreased migration and invasion of various prostate cancer cell lines. This phenotype was consistent with remarkable cytoskeletal remodeling and inhibition of integrin alpha 1 and beta 4 expression, both in vitro and in vivo. CRISPR/Cas9-based deletion of ERRα suppressed PGC1α regulation of cytoskeletal organization and invasiveness. Mechanistically, PGC1α expression decreased MYC levels and activity prior to inhibition of invasiveness. In addition, PGC1α and ERRα associated at the MYC promoter, supporting the inhibitory activity PGC1α. The inverse correlation between PGC1α-ERRα activity and MYC levels was corroborated in multiple prostate cancer datasets. Altogether, these results support that PGC1α-ERRα functions as a tumor-suppressive transcriptional complex through the regulation of metabolic and signaling events.

Patients and methods:   In the 65 metastatic prostate cancer patients in group 1, androgen deprivation therapy was stopped when prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels reached a nadir and was resumed when PSA levels doubled and ≥ 1.0 ng/mL (new protocol). In the 62 patients in group 2, androgen deprivation therapy was stopped 3 months after PSA = 0.2 ng/mL and resumed at PSA ≥ 4.0 ng/mL (Chinese Urological Association guideline).

We aimed to investigate the oncologic outcomes of focal laser ablation (FLA) and compare them with those of radical prostatectomy (RP).  Patients and methods:   Patients treated with FLA or RP for localized PCa between 2004 and 2015 were identified from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database. Kaplan-Meier curves and multivariate Cox proportional hazard models were utilized to calculate the survival benefits. Propensity score (PS) matching and adjusted standardized mortality ratio weighting (SMRW) models were used to balance the 2 groups. Subgroup analyses according to tumor stage, prostate-specific antigen level, and Gleason score were also conducted.  Results:   A total of 12,875 patients were included, of whom 12,433 were treated with RP, whereas 442 were treated with FLA; 321 pairs of patients were eventually matched. Baseline characteristics were well-balanced by PS matching. The mean follow-up was 59.62 months for the RP group and 62.26 months for the FLA group. Before matching, the FLA group had lower but statistically insignificant cancer-specific mortality (CSM) (hazard ratio [HR], 0.61; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.15-2.45; P = .4879) and higher any-cause mortality (ACM) (HR, 2.35; 95% CI, 1.38-3.98; P = .0016) compared with the RP group, which was supported by the outcomes in the PS-matched cohort (CSM: HR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.18-3.67; P = .7936; ACM: HR, 2.35; 95% CI, 1.38-3.98; P = .0016) and the SMRW model (CSM: HR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.15-2.44; P = .4877; ACM: HR, 2.01; 95% CI, 1.18-3.42; P = .0103).

Objective:   To determine the impact of abiraterone and enzalutamide on PROs.  Design, setting, and participants:   AQUARiUS (NCT02813408) was a prospective, 12-mo, observational study in patients with mCRPC from Denmark, France, and the UK.  Intervention:   Abiraterone or enzalutamide treatment according to routine practise.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   PROs were collected over 12 mo using Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Cognitive Function (FACT-Cog), Brief Fatigue Inventory-Short Form (BFI-SF), Brief Pain Inventory-Short Form, and European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer-Quality of Life Questionnaire (QLQ-C30) at baseline and routine visits. Outcomes included mean change in PROs, patients with clinically meaningful worsening (CMW) in PROs, and safety. Data were analysed using repeated measures linear and logistic models adjusted for baseline characteristics.  Results and limitations:   Abiraterone-treated (N = 105) and enzalutamide-treated (N = 106) patients were included. Key PRO items (cognitive impairments and fatigue) were significantly (p < 0.05) in favour of abiraterone versus enzalutamide during the study. ""Perceived cognitive impairment"" and ""comments from others"" (FACT-Cog); ""fatigue right now"", ""usual level of fatigue"", and ""worst level of fatigue"" (BFI-SF); and ""cognitive functioning"" and ""fatigue"" (QLQ-C30) were significantly in favour of abiraterone over enzalutamide for three or more consecutive periods up to month 12. From study initiation, significantly fewer patients receiving abiraterone experienced one or more CMW episode in cognition and fatigue. Fatigue and asthenia (adverse events) were lower with abiraterone than with enzalutamide (5% vs 15% and 10% vs 11%, respectively). There were no treatment-related deaths. Limitations included lack of randomisation.  Conclusions:   In a real-world setting, this 12-mo analysis suggests an advantage of abiraterone acetate plus prednisone over enzalutamide on fatigue and cognitive function; this finding occurred early after treatment initiation. This difference should be considered when choosing treatment.  Patient summary:   This study looked at the effect of two treatments (abiraterone acetate plus prednisone and enzalutamide) for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer on patient quality of life over 12 mo.

Here we reported a thrombin-linked sandwich immunoassay for proteins to demonstrate new applications of thrombin and the aptamers, converting protein detection to analysis of thrombin label. In this assay, target protein was sandwiched by the capture antibody on a microplate and the biotinylated detection antibody. Thrombin bound to one biotinylated aptamer, and then the thrombin-labeled aptamer was attached on the sandwich complex through streptavidin-biotin interaction by using streptavidin as a linker. Thrombin catalyzed cleavage of fluorogenic peptide substrates, generating fluorescence signals for target detection. Among a few different anti-thrombin aptamers, the use of one nuclease resistant RNA aptamer having phosphorodithioate (PS2) modification on a specific backbone position enabled higher assay sensitivity due to its much higher affinity. This thrombin-linked sandwich immunoassay allowed detection of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) at 2 pM, an important protein related cancer disease, with high sensitivity and specificity. The strategy was general, and also enabled sensitive detection of botulinum neurotoxin type A (BoNTA) light chain, one toxin protein causing risk to human health. This assay combines advantages of antibody recognition, aptamer affinity labeling, high affinity of aptamers, and enzyme activity of thrombin. Labeling thrombin on the immunosandwich complex through simple affinity binding overcomes limitations of covalent conjugating enzyme on antibody in conventional immunoassay. This assay is promising in applications for protein detection.""","""['Chao Wang', 'Yang Sun', 'Qiang Zhao']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Talanta""","""['Thrombin-linked aptamer assay for detection of platelet derived growth factor BB on magnetic beads in a sandwich format.', 'A competitive thrombin-linked aptamer assay for small molecule: aflatoxin B1.', 'Surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy study of interfacial binding of thrombin to antithrombin DNA aptamers.', 'Aptamer-based fluorescent biosensors.', 'Aptamer binding assays and molecular interaction studies using fluorescence anisotropy - A review.', 'Emerging Progress of RNA-Based Antitumor Therapeutics.', 'Development of a Gold Nanoparticle-Linked Immunosorbent Assay of Staphylococcal Enterotoxin B Detection with Extremely High Sensitivity by Determination of Gold Atom Content Using Graphite Furnace Atomic Absorption Spectrometry.', 'Visual detection of tropomyosin, a major shrimp allergenic protein using gold nanoparticles (AuNPs)-assisted colorimetric aptasensor.', 'Nanozyme and Stimulated Fluorescent Cu-Based Metal-Organic Frameworks (Cu-MOFs) Functionalized with Engineered Aptamers as a Molecular Recognition Element for Thrombin Detection in the Plasma of COVID-19 Patients.']"""

A possible factor in this context is the subjectively perceived cause of the disease, which can have a significant influence on the experience of distress, therapy adherence and preventive behaviour. The aim of this study was to record subjective reasons for PCa in long-term survivors and to investigate associated factors.  Material and methods:   PCa survivors from the national research project ""Familial Prostate Cancer"" were included in the study. As part of the annual postal follow-up questionnaire, PCa survivors were asked about subjectively perceived causes of their PCa. Responses were assigned to 18 possible categories. In addition, the association between the subjectively perceived causes of PCa and secondary tumours, a positive family history of tumour diseases and sociodemographic factors was investigated.  Results:   Of the 9 047 PCa survivors surveyed, 4 054 (44.8 %) provided information on the subjectively perceived causes of their PCa and were included in this analysis. The mean time since diagnosis was 10.1 years with a mean age of 63.1 years at diagnosis. The most frequent responses were ""don't know"" (31.8 %), genetics (30.1 %) and stress (18.5 %). Age, the most important risk factor for PCa, was rarely mentioned (2.5 %). In addition to these responses, unusual non-evidence-based reasons were also reported. Men with a positive family history of PCa cited genetics as the cause of their disease about 4 times more frequently than sporadic cases. This proportion increased with the number of affected family members. PCa survivors aged ≤ 65 years at diagnosis indicated stress as the cause of their PCa approximately 2 times more often than men who were older than 65 years at PCa diagnosis.  Conclusion:   Most men surveyed reported non-evidence-based causes of their PCa. Preventive programs should address the evidence-based causes more distinctly and with a high visibility. Due to the significance of lay illness beliefs for the experience of distress and the adherence to treatment, the patient's subjective cause of disease should be surveyed and considered by the urologist in charge.""","""['Veronika Elisabeth Goethe', 'Andreas Dinkel', 'Helga Schulwitz', 'Alexandra Nöhreiter', 'Jürgen Erich Gschwend', 'Kathleen Herkommer']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Aktuelle Urol""","""['Influence of family history on psychosocial distress and perceived need for treatment in prostate cancer survivors.', 'Internet use after prostate cancer : Search for information and trust in disease-related information in long-term survivors.', 'Benefit finding in long-term prostate cancer survivors.', 'Multiparametric MRI in detection and staging of prostate cancer.', 'The prognostic and predictive value of TMPRSS2-ERG gene fusion and ERG protein expression in prostate cancer biopsies.']"""

However, little is known about the role of circFoxo3 in prostate cancer, which the present study seeks to investigate. CircFoxo3 expression was analyzed in 22 low-grade prostate cancer samples, 24 high-graded prostate cancer samples, and 18 normal prostate tissues, finding that its quantity was significantly decreased in high-graded compared to low-grade prostate cancer and normal prostate tissues. CircFoxo3 inhibited prostate cancer cell survival, migration, invasion and chemoresistance to docetaxel, which was related to circFoxo3's repression of Foxo3 and EMT. Silencing circFoxo3 expression promoted prostate cancer cell survival, migration, invasion and chemoresistance to docetaxel, as well as the positive effects of androgen on prostate cancer viability. Delivery of circfoxo3 enhanced chemosensitivity to docetaxel of prostate tumor-bearing mice and prolonged the life span of mice, while reduction with siRNAs promoted chemoresistance to docetaxel and shorted the life span of the tumor-bearing mice.

In previous reports, we could not demonstrate the postulated superiority of hypofractionation in terms of relapse-free survival at 5 years. The frequent use of long-term androgen deprivation therapy might have had substantial effects on relapse-free survival. In the current analysis, we provide updated 7-year relapse-free survival outcomes.  Methods and materials:   We enrolled patients with intermediate- to high-risk T1b-T4NX-N0MX-M0 localized prostate cancer. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to either HF (64.6 Gy in 19 fractions) or CF (78.0 Gy in 39 fractions) radiation therapy. Based on an estimated α/β ratio for prostate cancer of 1.5 Gy, the EQD2 was 90.4 Gy for HF versus 78.0 Gy for CF radiation therapy. The primary endpoint of the present analysis is relapse-free survival at 7 years.  Results:   A total of 820 patients were enrolled, of whom 804 were assessable for the current evaluation (407 HF versus 397 CF). Median follow-up was 89 months (interquartile range, 83-99). Concomitant androgen deprivation therapy was prescribed for 537 (67%) of 804 patients for a median duration of 32 months (interquartile range, 10-44). Treatment failure at 7 years was reported in 220 (27.4%) of 804 patients, 107 (26.3%) in HF versus 113 (28.5%) in CF radiation therapy. Seven-year relapse-free survival was 71.7% (95% confidence interval [CI], 66.4-76.4) for HF versus 67.6% (95% CI, 62.0-72.5) for CF (P = .52). Overall survival was 80.8% (95% CI, 76.5-84.4) in HF versus 77.6% (95% CI, 73.0-81.5) in CF radiation therapy (P = .17).

Primary tumor grade and cribriform architecture are important parameters for clinical outcome; however, their relevance at positive surgical margins has not been completely elucidated yet. We reviewed 835 radical prostatectomy specimens and recorded pT-stage, surgical margin status, Grade Group, and cribriform architecture of the primary tumor and at positive surgical margins. Clinicopathologic parameters and biochemical recurrence-free survival (BCRFS) were used as endpoints. Positive surgical margins were present in 284 (34%) patients, with a median cumulative length of 5.0 mm. In 46%, the Grade Group at the margin was equal to the primary tumor grade, while being lower in 42% and higher in 12%. In multivariable analysis, Grade Group at the margin outperformed the Grade Group of the primary tumor in predicting BCRFS. Among primary Grade Group 2 patients, 56% had Grade Group 1 disease at the margin. Multivariable analysis identified cumulative length, Grade Group at the margin, and lymph node metastasis as independent predictors for BCRFS, while percentage Gleason pattern 4, tertiary Gleason pattern 5 of the primary tumor, and cribriform architecture at the margin were not. In conclusion, the Grade Group at the positive surgical margin was dissimilar to the primary tumor grade in 54% and better predicted BCRFS than the primary tumor grade.

The potential of deep learning to provide diagnostic support for human interpretation requires further evaluation. Purpose To compare the performance of clinical assessment to a deep learning system optimized for segmentation trained with T2-weighted and diffusion MRI in the task of detection and segmentation of lesions suspicious for sPC. Materials and Methods In this retrospective study, T2-weighted and diffusion prostate MRI sequences from consecutive men examined with a single 3.0-T MRI system between 2015 and 2016 were manually segmented. Ground truth was provided by combined targeted and extended systematic MRI-transrectal US fusion biopsy, with sPC defined as International Society of Urological Pathology Gleason grade group greater than or equal to 2. By using split-sample validation, U-Net was internally validated on the training set (80% of the data) through cross validation and subsequently externally validated on the test set (20% of the data). U-Net-derived sPC probability maps were calibrated by matching sextant-based cross-validation performance to clinical performance of Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS). Performance of PI-RADS and U-Net were compared by using sensitivities, specificities, predictive values, and Dice coefficient. Results A total of 312 men (median age, 64 years; interquartile range [IQR], 58-71 years) were evaluated. The training set consisted of 250 men (median age, 64 years; IQR, 58-71 years) and the test set of 62 men (median age, 64 years; IQR, 60-69 years). In the test set, PI-RADS cutoffs greater than or equal to 3 versus cutoffs greater than or equal to 4 on a per-patient basis had sensitivity of 96% (25 of 26) versus 88% (23 of 26) at specificity of 22% (eight of 36) versus 50% (18 of 36). U-Net at probability thresholds of greater than or equal to 0.22 versus greater than or equal to 0.33 had sensitivity of 96% (25 of 26) versus 92% (24 of 26) (both P > .99) with specificity of 31% (11 of 36) versus 47% (17 of 36) (both P > .99), not statistically different from PI-RADS. Dice coefficients were 0.89 for prostate and 0.35 for MRI lesion segmentation. In the test set, coincidence of PI-RADS greater than or equal to 4 with U-Net lesions improved the positive predictive value from 48% (28 of 58) to 67% (24 of 36) for U-Net probability thresholds greater than or equal to 0.33 (P = .01), while the negative predictive value remained unchanged (83% [25 of 30] vs 83% [43 of 52]; P > .99).

John Henryism is defined as a measure of active coping in response to stressful experiences. John Henryism has been linked with health conditions such as diabetes, prostate cancer, and hypertension, but rarely with health behaviors. Aims. We hypothesized that reporting higher scores on the John Henryism Scale may be associated with poorer medication adherence, and trust in providers may mediate this relationship. Method. We tested this hypothesis using data from the TRUST study. The TRUST study included 787 African Americans with hypertension receiving care at a safety-net hospital. Ordinal logistic regression was used to examine the relationship between John Henryism and medication adherence. Results. Within our sample of African Americans with hypertension, lower John Henryism scores was associated with poorer self-reported adherence (low, 20.62; moderate, 19.19; high, 18.12; p < .001). Higher John Henryism scores were associated with lower trust scores (low John Henryism: 40.1; high John Henryism: 37.9; p < .001). In the adjusted model, each 1-point increase in the John Henryism score decreased the odds of being in a better cumulative medication adherence category by a factor of 4% (odds ratio = 0.96, p = .014, 95% confidence interval = 0.93-0.99). Twenty percent of the association between medication adherence and John Henryism was mediated by trust (standard deviation = 0.205, 95% confidence interval = 0.074-0.335). Discussion. This study provides important insights into the complex relationship between psychological responses and health behaviors. It also contributes to the body of literature examining the construct of John Henryism among African Americans with hypertension. Conclusion. The findings of this study support the need for interventions that promote healthful coping strategies and patient-provider trust.""","""['Yendelela L Cuffee', 'Lee Hargraves', 'Milagros Rosal', 'Becky A Briesacher', 'Jeroan J Allison', 'Sandral Hullett']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Health Educ Behav""","""['Socioeconomic status, John Henryism and blood pressure among African-Americans in the Jackson Heart Study.', 'Reported racial discrimination, trust in physicians, and medication adherence among inner-city African Americans with hypertension.', 'Coping, Discrimination, and Physical Health Conditions Among Predominantly Poor, Urban African Americans: Implications for Community-Level Health Services.', 'Poor Medication Adherence in African Americans Is a Matter of Trust.', 'Enhancing adherence of antihypertensive regimens in hypertensive African-Americans: current and future prospects.', 'The association between social functioning and health literacy among rural Southeastern African Americans with hypertension.', 'A Qualitative Analysis to Understand Perception about Medication-Related Problems among Older Minority Adults in a Historically Black Community.', 'Allostatic Load Among Black Sexual Minority Women.']"""

However, the molecular mechanism regulating tumorigenesis and progression in seminal vesicles of TRAMP mice remains largely unknown. In this study, C57BL/6 TRAMP mice were found to have a significantly shorter lifespan than wild-type (WT) mice and all of the seminal vesicles were markedly increased in size and weight with age from 24 weeks exhibiting a clearly papillary-phyllode pattern, though no obvious difference was observed in multiple organs including heart, liver, spleen, lungs, kidneys, testicles and bone between TRAMP and WT mice, and less than 10% of TRAMP mice developed prostate tumors. Western blotting showed Cyclin (CCN) B1 and CCND1 were remarkably overexpressed in seminal vesicle tumors of TRAMP mice at 24 weeks of age and increased with age till the end of trial, which was confirmed by Immunohistochemistry (IHC). P21 and P27 were also significantly augmented, whereas P53 and phosphorylated P53 (p-P53) were constantly expressed in normal controls and P53 did not appear to be mutated. Not only cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 1 and phosphorylated forkhead box protein (FOX) O1 but also CDK4, CDK6 and phosphorylated retinoblastoma-associated protein (RB) had similar increase trends, so did epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), AKT serine/threonine kinase (AKT), and their respective phosphorylation levels. Signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 3, p-STAT3, enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) and EZH2 mediated trimethylation of histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27me3) were considerably elevated, too.

Results:   Eighteen patients with a total of 27 LNs were treated with CT-guided CA (Galil Medical, Israel). One patient was excluded since no follow-up was available. The mean LN diameter was 11 mm (range 4-28 mm). Thirteen patients had a history of previous treatment for locoregional lymphadenopathy. In 21 LNs, a supplementary thermal insulation-displacement technique was used (hydrodissection = 12; carbodissection = 6; both = 3). According to the RECIST criteria, 8 LNs had a complete response, 8 stable disease, 8 partial response and 1 progressive disease. In the subgroup of patients with prostate cancer relapse, the mean PSA level before treatment was 5.5 ngr/ml (range 0.6-36 ngr/ml) and reduced to 0.32 (range 0-1.1 ngr/ml) and 0.3 (range 0-0.6 ngr/ml) at 3- and 6-month follow-up, respectively.

We identified and validated 1,178 loci associated with altered methylation in tumoral but not nonmalignant tissue. These tumor methylation quantitative trait loci influence chromatin structure, as well as RNA and protein abundance. One prominent tumor methylation quantitative trait locus is associated with AKT1 expression and is predictive of relapse after definitive local therapy in both discovery and validation cohorts.

AS/WW schedules require regular follow-up and adherence, and it is unknown to what extent patient socioeconomic status (SES) may impact management decisions for AS/WW. We sought to determine whether AS/WW use in the United States differs according to patient SES.  Design:   Using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Prostate with AS/WW Database, all adult men diagnosed with localized low-risk prostate cancer (clinical T1-T2a, Gleason 6, and prostate-specific antigen <10 ng/mL) and managed with either AS/WW, radical prostatectomy, or radiotherapy were identified between 2010 and 2015. SES tertile was measured by the validated Yost Index (low: 0-10,901; middle: 10,904-11,469; high: 11,470-11,827). AS/WW trends were defined across SES tertiles from 2010 to 2015. Logistic multivariable regression defined adjusted odds ratios (aOR) for receipt of AS/WW by SES tertile.  Results:   In 50,302 men, AS/WW use was higher with increasing SES tertile (24.6, 25.3, and 30.5% for low, middle, and high SES tertiles, respectively; PTrend (SES) <0.001). From 2010 to 2015, AS/WW use in the low, middle, and high SES tertiles increased from 11.2 to 37.3%, 14.1 to 45.8%, and 17.6 to 46.4%, respectively (PTrends <0.001). By 2015, likelihood of AS/WW became comparable among the middle vs. high SES tertiles (aOR 0.96, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.83-1.11, P = 0.55), but remained lower among the low vs. high SES tertile (aOR 0.73, 95% CI: 0.64-0.83, P < 0.001).  Conclusions:   AS/WW use for low-risk prostate cancer in the US differs by SES. Despite increases in AS/WW across SES from 2010 to 2015, patients from low SES received significantly lower rates of AS/WW compared with higher SES groups. SES may therefore influence management decisions, where factors associated with low SES might act as a barrier to AS/WW, and may need to be addressed to reduce any disproportionate risk of unnecessary treatment to lower SES patients.""","""['Santino S Butler', 'Stacy Loeb', 'Alexander P Cole', 'Cierra Zaslowe-Dude', 'Vinayak Muralidhar', 'Daniel W Kim', 'Edward M Schaeffer', 'Quoc-Dien Trinh', 'Paul L Nguyen', 'Brandon A Mahal']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Prostate Cancer Prostatic Dis""","""['Socioeconomic determinants are associated with the utilization and outcomes of active surveillance or watchful waiting in favorable-risk prostate cancer.', 'The New Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Prostate with Watchful Waiting Database: Opportunities and Limitations.', 'Conservative management of low-risk prostate cancer among young versus older men in the United States: Trends and outcomes from a novel national database.', 'Radical prostatectomy versus watchful waiting for prostate cancer.', 'Prostate-Specific Antigen-Based Screening for Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Evidence Review for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force Internet.', 'Socioeconomic determinants are associated with the utilization and outcomes of active surveillance or watchful waiting in favorable-risk prostate cancer.', 'Intensity of observation with active surveillance or watchful waiting in men with prostate cancer in the United States.', 'Variation in the Use of Active Surveillance for Low-Risk Prostate Cancer Across US Census Regions.', 'Impact of a Genomic Test on Treatment Decision in a Predominantly African American Population With Favorable-Risk Prostate Cancer: A Randomized Trial.', 'Receipt of Guideline-Recommended Surveillance in a Population-Based Cohort of Prostate Cancer Patients Undergoing Active Surveillance.']"""

Administering T-replacement therapy (TRT) reverses many of the symptoms associated with low T levels. However, TRT is linked to side effects such as infertility and increased risk of prostate cancer and cardiovascular diseases. Thus, there is a need to obtain T-producing cells that could be used to treat hypogonadism via transplantation and reestablishment of T-producing cell lineages in the body. T is synthesized by Leydig cells (LCs), proposed to derive from mesenchymal cells of mesonephric origin. Although mesenchymal cells have been successfully induced into LCs, the limited source and possible trauma to donors hinders their application to clinical therapies. Alternatively, human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs), which are expandable in culture and have the potential to differentiate into all somatic cell types, have become the emerging source of autologous cell therapies. We have successfully induced the differentiation of hiPSCs into either human Leydig-like (hLLCs) or adrenal-like cells (hALCs) using chemically defined culture conditions. Factors critical for the development of LCs were added to both culture systems. hLLCs expressed all steroidogenic genes and proteins important for T biosynthesis, synthesized T rather than cortisol, secreted steroid hormones in response to dibutyryl-cAMP and 22(R)-hydroxycholesterol, and displayed ultrastructural features resembling LCs. By contrast, hALCs synthesized cortisol rather than T. The success in generating hiPSC-derived hLLCs with broad human LC (hLC) features supports the potential for hiPSC-based hLC regeneration.""","""['Lu Li', 'Yuchang Li', 'Chantal Sottas', 'Martine Culty', 'Jinjiang Fan', 'Yiman Hu', 'Garett Cheung', 'Héctor E Chemes', 'Vassilios Papadopoulos']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A""","""['An approach that someday may boost testosterone biosynthesis in males with late-onset hypogonadism (low testosterone).', 'Differentiation of Human Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells Into Testosterone-Producing Leydig-like Cells.', 'Differentiation of human induced pluripotent stem cells into Leydig-like cells with molecular compounds.', 'Differentiation of human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells into Leydig-like cells with defined molecular compounds.', 'Advances in stem cell research for the treatment of primary hypogonadism.', 'Stem Leydig Cells in the Adult Testis: Characterization, Regulation and Potential Applications.', 'SARS-CoV-2 Enters Human Leydig Cells and Affects Testosterone Production In Vitro.', 'High-fidelity reprogramming into Leydig-like cells by CRISPR activation and paracrine factors.', 'Reconstitution of human adrenocortical specification and steroidogenesis using induced pluripotent stem cells.', 'Generation of Leydig-like cells: approaches, characterization, and challenges.', 'In Vitro Differentiation of Leydig Cells From hiPSCs: A First Step Towards a Cellular Therapy for Hypogonadism?']"""

Objective:   To determine the impact of focal cryotherapy on urinary and sexual function, specifically assessing return to baseline function.  Design, setting, and participants:   Between October 2013 and November 2016, 58 of 122 men who underwent focal cryotherapy for predominantly anterior clinically significant localised prostate cancer within a prospective registry returned patient-reported outcome measure questionnaires, which included International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) and International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF-15) questionnaires.  Intervention:   Standard cryotherapy procedure using either the SeedNet or the Visual-ICE cryotherapy system.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Primary outcome was return to baseline function of IPSS score and IIEF erectile function (EF) subdomain. Cumulative incidence and Cox-regression analyses were performed.  Results and limitations:   Probability of returning to baseline IPSS function was 78% at 12 mo and 87% at both 18 and 24 mo, with recovery seen up to 18 mo. For IIEF (EF domain), the probability of returning to baseline function was 85% at 12 mo and 89% at both 18 and 24 mo, with recovery seen up to 18 mo. Only the preoperative IIEF-EF score was associated with a poor outcome (hazard ratio 0.96, 95% confidence interval 0.93-0.999, p = 0.04). The main limitation was that only half of the patients returned their questionnaires.  Conclusions:   In men undergoing primary focal cryotherapy, there is a high degree of preservation of urinary and erectile function with return to baseline function occurring from 3 mo and continuing up to 18 mo after focal cryotherapy.  Patient summary:   In men who underwent focal cryotherapy for prostate cancer, approximately nine in 10 returned to their baseline urinary and sexual function.

The presence of hematoma, infection, and other complications in patients in these two groups were investigated at 3 and 12 months following the surgery. The patients were also followed up using a self-designed testicular castration satisfaction questionnaire.  Results:   A higher score indicated greater satisfaction. The mean score was 15.33 ± 2.85 in the experimental group and 4.63 ± 1.45 in the control group at 3 months after the surgery. The mean score was 14.92 ± 1.74 in the experimental group and 4.25 ± 1.61 in the control group at 12 months after the surgery.

In this study, we tried to identify DNA methylation markers to differentiate cancer samples from the respective normal samples in pan-cancers. We collected whole genome methylation data of 27 cancer types containing 10,140 cancer samples and 3386 normal samples, and divided all samples into five data sets, including one training data set, one validation data set and three test data sets. We applied machine learning to identify DNA methylation markers, and specifically, we constructed diagnostic prediction models by deep learning. We identified two categories of markers: 12 CpG markers and 13 promoter markers. Three of 12 CpG markers and four of 13 promoter markers locate at cancer-related genes. With the CpG markers, our model achieved an average sensitivity and specificity on test data sets as 92.8% and 90.1%, respectively. For promoter markers, the average sensitivity and specificity on test data sets were 89.8% and 81.1%, respectively. Furthermore, in cell-free DNA methylation data of 163 prostate cancer samples, the CpG markers achieved the sensitivity as 100%, and the promoter markers achieved 92%.

We aimed to assess the prospective association between frequency of sauna bathing and the risk of all-cause and site-specific cancers using the Kuopio Ischemic Heart Disease prospective cohort.  Methods:   Baseline sauna bathing habits were assessed in 2173 men aged 42-61 years with no history of cancer. Hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for cancer were calculated using Cox proportional hazard models. We corrected for within-person variability in sauna bathing habits using data from repeat assessments taken 11 years apart.  Results:   During a median follow-up of 24.3 years, 588 (27.1%) all-cause cancer cases were recorded. The age-adjusted regression dilution ratio of sauna bathing frequency was 0.69 (0.62-0.76).

In humans, the prostate, stimulated by environmentally regulated endocrine and local androgens, grows throughout adult life. We previously showed that in fly accessory glands, secondary cells (SCs) and their nuclei also grow in adults, a process enhanced by mating and controlled by bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signalling. Here, we demonstrate that BMP-mediated SC growth is dependent on the receptor for the developmental steroid ecdysone, whose concentration is reported to reflect sociosexual experience in adults. BMP signalling appears to regulate ecdysone receptor (EcR) levels via one or more mechanisms involving the EcR's N terminus or the RNA sequence that encodes it. Nuclear growth in virgin males is dependent on ecdysone, some of which is synthesised in SCs. However, mating induces additional BMP-mediated nuclear growth via a cell type-specific form of hormone-independent EcR signalling, which drives genome endoreplication in a subset of adult SCs. Switching to hormone-independent endoreplication after mating allows growth and secretion to be hyperactivated independently of ecdysone levels in SCs, permitting more rapid replenishment of the accessory gland luminal contents. Our data suggest mechanistic parallels between this physiological, behaviour-induced signalling switch and altered pathological signalling associated with prostate cancer progression.""","""['Aaron Leiblich', 'Josephine E E U Hellberg', 'Aashika Sekar', 'Carina Gandy', 'Claudia C Mendes', 'Siamak Redhai', 'John Mason', 'Mark Wainwright', 'Pauline Marie', 'Deborah C I Goberdhan', 'Freddie C Hamdy', 'Clive Wilson']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""PLoS Biol""","""['Ecdysone receptor expression and activity in adult Drosophila melanogaster.', 'Two-factor specification of apoptosis: TGF-β signaling acts cooperatively with ecdysone signaling to induce cell- and stage-specific apoptosis of larval neurons during metamorphosis in Drosophila melanogaster.', 'Regulation of Dense-Core Granule Replenishment by Autocrine BMP Signalling in Drosophila Secondary Cells.', 'Ecdysone receptors: from the Ashburner model to structural biology.', 'Ecdysone signaling in adult Drosophila melanogaster.', 'Rbf/E2F1 control growth and endoreplication via steroid-independent Ecdysone Receptor signalling in Drosophila prostate-like secondary cells.', 'Cyclin E overexpression in the Drosophila accessory gland induces tissue dysplasia.', 'Drosophila Accessory Gland: A Complementary In Vivo Model to Bring New Insight to Prostate Cancer.', 'Evolution of sexual development and sexual dimorphism in insects.', 'Transcriptome analysis of Anastrepha fraterculus sp. 1 males, females, and embryos: insights into development, courtship, and reproduction.']"""

Currently, there is no agreement on how to measure and what are the best cutoff points to be used in practice. We hypothesized that digital microscopy would potentially provide more objective measurements of extraprostatic extension, thus better defining its clinical significance. To further our knowledge on digital prostate pathology, we evaluated the status of extraprostatic extension in 107 consecutive laparoscopic radical prostatectomy samples, using digital and conventional light microscopy. Mean linear and radial measurements of extraprostatic extension by digital microscopy significantly correlated to pT status (p = 0.022 and p = 0.050, respectively) but only radial measurements correlated to biochemical recurrence (p = 0.042) and grade groups (p = 0.022). None of the measurements, whether conventional or digital, were associated with lymph node status. Receiving operating characteristic analysis showed a potential cutoff point to assess linear measurements by conventional (< vs. > 24.21 mm) or digital microscopy (< vs. > 15 mm) or by radial measurement (< vs. > 1.6 mm). Finally, we observed an association between the number of paraffin blocks bearing EPE with pT (p = 0.041) status (digital microscopy), and linear measurements by conventional (p = 0.044) or digital microscopy (p = 0.045) with lymph node status.

Despite this, the complex mechanisms remain unclear. This study aims to investigate factors which correlate with development of fatigue.  Methods:   Twenty-seven men with high-risk prostate cancer undergoing radiation therapy and 18 months of ADT were assessed for fatigue, haemoglobin (Hb), testosterone, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) fat fraction (FF) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), at baseline and at intervals after radiotherapy. Changes from baseline were analysed using paired t-tests. Linear time trends were assessed using linear mixed effect models.  Results:   Overall, mean fatigue score increased from baseline to the 18-month time interval (difference 4.5, P = 0.0114). The mean value for Hb significantly decreased (P < 0.001) from baseline to 18 months. The mean value for testosterone significantly decreased (P < 0.001) from baseline to 12 months, and remained low. Mean for MRI FF showed a significant increase (P < 0.001) from baseline to 6 months. MRI ADC showed a non-significant decrease from baseline to 6 months (P = 0.4416).  Conclusion:   Radiotherapy and ADT resulted in a significant increase in fatigue scores. Statistically significant changes were noted in Hb, testosterone and MRI FF and ADC, however, none were shown to have a strong association with worsening fatigue.

Purpose:   To evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of a unique biparametric MRI protocol (IMPROD bpMRI) combined with clinical and molecular markers in men with cSPCa.  Study type:   Prospective single-institutional clinical trial (NCT01864135).  Subjects:   Eighty men with cSPCa.  Field strength/sequence:   3T, surface array coils.

Assessment:   IMPROD bpMRI examinations were qualitatively (IMPROD bpMRI Likert score) and quantitatively (DWI-based Gleason grade score) prospectively reported. Men with IMPROD bpMRI Likert 3-5 had two targeted biopsies followed by 12-core systematic biopsies (SB); those with IMPROD bpMRI Likert 1-2 had only SB. Additionally, 2-core from normal-appearing prostate areas were obtained for the mRNA expression of ACSM1, AMACR, CACNA1D, DLX1, PCA3, PLA2G7, RHOU, SPINK1, SPON2, TMPRSS2-ERG, and TDRD1 measured by quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction.  Statistical tests:   Univariate and multivariate analysis using regularized least-squares, feature selection and tournament leave-pair-out cross-validation (TLPOCV), as well as 10 random splits of the data in training-testing sets, were used to evaluate the mRNA, clinical and IMPROD bpMRI parameters in detecting clinically significant prostate cancer (SPCa) defined as Gleason score ≥ 3 + 4.

Purpose:   To investigate why some parts of lesions are not visible on mpMRI by comparing their histopathology features to those of visible regions.  Study type:   Retrospective.  Population:   Thirty-four patients with biopsy-proven prostate cancer scheduled for prostatectomy (median 68.7 years).  Field strength/sequence:   T2 -weighted, diffusion-weighted imaging, T2 mapping, and dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI on two 3T systems and one 1.5T system.  Assessment:   Two readers delineated suspicious lesions on mpMRI. A pathologist delineated the lesions on histopathology. A patient-customized mold enabled the registration of histopathology and MRI. On histopathology we identified mpMRI visible and invisible lesions. Subsequently, within the visible lesions we identified regions that were visible and regions that were invisible on mpMRI. For each lesion and region the following characteristics were determined: size, location, International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) grade, and Gleason subpatterns (density [dense/intermediate], tumor morphology [homogeneous/heterogeneous], cribriform growth [yes/no]).  Statistical tests:   With generalized linear mixed-effect modeling we investigated which features explain why a lesion or a region was invisible on MRI. We compared imaging values (T2 , ADC, and Ktrans ) for these features with one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA).  Results:   Small, anterior, and ISUP grade 1-2 lesions (n = 34) were missed more frequent than large, posterior, ISUP grade ≥ 3 lesions (n = 35). Invisible regions on mpMRI had lower tumor density, heterogeneous tumor morphology, and were located in the transition zone. Both T2 and ADC values were higher in ""intermediate"" compared with ""dense"" regions (P = 0.002 and < 0.001) and in regions with heterogeneous compared with homogeneous morphology (P < 0.001 and 0.03).

The as-fabricated PFCDs exhibited several advantages such as easy preparation, high biocompatibility, low toxicity, good water-solubility, and excellent photothermal effect with robust blue fluorescence emission. The PSMA-directed imaging of PCa using PFCDs showed remarkable fluorescence enhancement in LNCap cells as compared to the case of other cells that did not express PSMA. PFCDs exhibited a photothermal effect in the PCa cells when irradiated with an 808 nm laser, which possibly resulted in the complete elimination of the tumor.

Results:   Results showed that PCa patients (n = 40) can be differentiated from cancer-free subjects (n = 42) based on their urinary volatile profile in both VOCs and VCCs models, unveiling significant differences in the levels of several metabolites. The models constructed were further validated using an external validation set (n = 18 PCa and n = 18 controls) to evaluate sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of the urinary volatile profile to discriminate PCa from controls. The VOCs model disclosed 78% sensitivity, 94% specificity and 86% accuracy, whereas the VCCs model achieved the same sensitivity, a specificity of 100% and an accuracy of 89%. Our findings unveil a panel of 6 volatile compounds significantly altered in PCa patients' urine samples that was able to identify PCa, with a sensitivity of 89%, specificity of 83%, and accuracy of 86%.

However, many prostate cancer patients experience biochemical recurrence after surgery and/or undergo salvage radiotherapy or hormone therapy. Timely treatment is required to prevent the spread of disease in these cases, and biopsy tissue may hold potential for disease prognostication before surgery is ever performed. We previously developed a prognostic multigene methylation panel in RP specimens, including APC, CRIP3, HOXD3, and TGFB2. In the current study, this panel was applied to a cohort of biopsy specimens (n = 86), which were assessed for DNA methylation using the real-time quantitative PCR-based multiplex MethyLight. The biopsy-based methylation panel is significantly associated with biochemical recurrence when combined with the current clinical parameter of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels at diagnosis and is able to prognosticate the initiation of salvage radiotherapy, where it outperforms PSA, and/or hormone therapy after RP. In addition, this methylation panel is significantly associated with late recurrence occurring within 5 and 7 years after surgery, when combined with PSA at diagnosis. Combining DNA methylation and clinicopathologic markers at the biopsy stage will not only increase their prognostic ability but will also ensure effective patient management.""","""['Andrea J Savio', 'Shivani Kamdar', 'Renu Jeyapala', 'Ekaterina Olkhov-Mitsel', 'Carmelle Cuizon', 'Antonio Finelli', 'Alexandre R Zlotta', 'Ants Toi', 'Neil E Fleshner', 'Theodorus van der Kwast', 'Bharati Bapat']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""J Mol Diagn""","""['HIFU as salvage first-line treatment for palpable, TRUS-evidenced, biopsy-proven locally recurrent prostate cancer after radical prostatectomy: a pilot study.', 'External beam radiotherapy versus radical prostatectomy for clinical stage T1-2 prostate cancer: therapeutic implications of stratification by pretreatment PSA levels and biopsy Gleason scores.', 'Impact of positive surgical margins on prostate-specific antigen failure after radical prostatectomy in adjuvant treatment-naïve patients.', 'Treatment of men with rising prostate-specific antigen levels following radical prostatectomy.', 'Prostate specific antigen only progression of prostate cancer.', 'Advances in Prognostic Methylation Biomarkers for Prostate Cancer.', 'Liquid Biopsy to Detect DNA/RNA Based Markers of Small DNA Oncogenic Viruses for Prostate Cancer Diagnosis, Prognosis, and Prediction.', 'Methylation in HOX Clusters and Its Applications in Cancer Therapy.']"""

Method:   The transcriptome datas of 499 cases of prostate cancer patients was downloaded from TCGA database. Differential genes associated with Gleason score were selected and filtered out by p < 0.05 and spearman coefficient >0.3. KEGG signaling pathway was enriched by differentially expressed genes, and TTK was selected as the research object. The expression of TTK was tested in prostate cancer tissues and prostate cancer cell lines. The changes of biological behavior of prostate cancer cell lines were verified after TTK was knocked out by siRNA and tumorigenic effect of TTK was verified by shRNA in vivo experiments.  Result:   The expression of TTK was positively correlated with Gleason score of prostate cancer, and the expression of protein and mRNA in metastatic prostate cancer cell lines was higher than that in non-metastatic prostate cancer cell lines. Vitro biological experiments showed that TTK gene knockout could inhibit the proliferation, invasion and migration of PC3 and DU145 cells, and promote cell apoptosis. In vivo experiments showed that TTK knockout inhibited tumorigenesis in mice. It was found that the expression of CDK2 and CCNE1 decreased after TTK was knocked out.

The exercise group completed 3 months of supervised aerobic and resistance exercise training (twice a week for 60 min), followed by 3 months of self-directed exercise. Outcomes were assessed at baseline, 3- and 6-months. The primary outcome was difference in fat mass at 3-months.

Methods:   This is an individual patient data level pooled analysis of HERA, NSBAP B-31, and NCCTG 9831 (Alliance Trials). Definitions of cardiac events were as per each individual study.  Results:   A total of 7445 patients enrolled in the 3 trials were included in the analysis, of which 4017 were in the trastuzumab and 3428 in the control (observation) arms, respectively. Median follow-up exceeded 10 years (119.2-137.2 months). Nearly all patients (97.4%) in the trastuzumab arms received anthracycline-based chemotherapy. In total, 452 patients in the trastuzumab arms experienced a cardiac event (11.3%), with most being mildly symptomatic or asymptomatic left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) decrease (351 patients, 8.7%). Severe congestive heart failure was more common in the trastuzumab arm (2.3%) than in the control arm (0.8%). Most cardiac events occurred during trastuzumab treatment (78.1%) and cardiac events were the main cause of discontinuation across the sample (10.0%); nevertheless, a large majority of patients completed trastuzumab treatment (76.2%). Baseline risk factors that were significantly associated with the development of cardiac events were baseline LVEF < 60%, hypertension, body mass index > 25, age ≥ 60 and, non-Caucasian ethnicity.  Conclusion:   One year of trastuzumab increases the risk of cardiac events, though most consist of asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic LVEF drops.

However, this system fails to explain the highly variable clinical behaviour seen for any one cancer. Molecular characterization through techniques such as next-generation sequencing (NGS) has led to an appreciation of the extreme genetic heterogeneity that underlies most human cancers. Because of the difficulties associated with fresh tissue biopsy, interest has increased in using circulating tumour material, such as circulating tumour cells (CTCs), as a non-invasive way to access tumour tissue. CTC enumeration has been demonstrated to have prognostic value in metastatic breast, colon and prostate cancers. Recent studies have also shown that CTCs are suitable material for molecular characterization, using techniques such as reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) and NGS. Furthermore, genetic analysis of CTCs may be more suitable to study tumour heterogeneity and clonal evolution than fresh tissue biopsy. Whether blood-based biopsy techniques will be accepted as a replacement to fresh tissue biopsies remains to be seen, but there is reason for optimism.

We show that PMEPA1 is upregulated in primary human gliomas. The PMEPA1 isoform PMEPA1a was predominantly expressed in glioma specimens and cell lines, and ectopic expression of the protein promoted glioma growth and invasion in vitro and in an orthotopic xenograft model in nude mice. In co-immunoprecipitation experiments, PMEPA1a associated with the Hippo tumor suppressor kinase LATS1. This interaction led to a proteasomal degradation of LATS1 through recruitment of the ubiquitin ligase, neural precursor cell expressed, developmentally downregulated 4 (NEDD4), which led to silencing of Hippo signaling. Alanine substitution in PMEPA1a at PY motifs resulted in failed LATS1 degradation. Targeting of a downstream component in the Hippo signaling pathway, YAP, with shRNA, interfered with the growth promoting activities of PMEPA1a in vitro and in vivo.

According to the radiopharmaceutical package insert, only 3% of the tracer is expected to be excreted in the urine over the first 4 h. Yet, in clinical practice we noticed a higher percentage of bladder excretion. We sought to evaluate and quantify early 18F-fluciclovine bladder radioactivity and determine whether refraining from voiding before 18F-fluciclovine injection would mitigate it. Methods: In total, 159 patients underwent 18F-fluciclovine PET/CT imaging as part of their clinical workup. The first 36 patients were instructed to void just before 18F-fluciclovine injection; the subsequent 123 patients were not asked to void. The SUVmax and SUVmean of the bladder, aorta, marrow, liver, and bladder volumes were determined. Comparing SUVmean of bladder to background, we characterized bladder radioactivity as insignificant (bladder < aorta), mild (bladder > aorta < marrow), moderate (bladder > marrow < liver), or intense (bladder > liver). Differences between the protocols were investigated. Results: Overall, 22% (35/159) of patients had moderate bladder activity and 8.8% (14/159) had intense bladder activity. A negative association was found between bladder volume and SUVmean A significant difference was found between the voiding and nonvoiding groups, with 38.9% (14/36) versus 17.1% (21/123) of patients, respectively, having moderate bladder activity and 22.2% (8/36) versus 4.9% (6/123) of patients, respectively, having intense bladder activity. Conclusion: Refraining from voiding before 18F-fluciclovine injection results in significantly lower urinary bladder radioactivity than does purposeful voiding before injection. We have modified our practice accordingly, particularly as moderate and intense bladder activity may mask or mimic local prostate cancer recurrence.

The radiation exposure to nuclear medicine personnel at the chest and extremity levels was assessed for tasks such as elution, dispensing, injecting, and collecting blood samples. Radiation levels were measured at distances of 1 cm and 1 m from patients immediately after, and at 1, 2, and 4 h after, the administration of 213Bi-peptide. Results: The external dose incurred at the chest level by radiopharmacists during synthesis, by physicians during injection, by technologists during imaging, and by nurses during sample collection was 2-7 μSv/procedure. The extremity dose was 1-14 μSv/procedure. The dose rate at 1 m from patients immediately after 213Bi-radiopharmaceutical injection was 0.02-0.03 μSv/MBq⋅h. Conclusion: The external radiation doses received by occupational workers involved in various procedures were far below the limit prescribed by the regulatory authority (20 mSv/y).""","""['Parul Thakral', 'Ishita Sen', 'Jakub Simecek', 'Sebastian Marx', 'Jyotsna Kumari', 'Sunil Kumar', 'Pankaj Tandon', 'Sugandha Dureja', 'Vineet Pant']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""J Nucl Med Technol""","""['Occupational Radiation Exposure of Radiopharmacy, Nuclear Medicine, and Surgical Personnel During Use of 99mTcTc-PSMA-I&S for Prostate Cancer Surgery.', 'Instantaneous exposure to nuclear medicine staff involved in PET-CT imaging in developing countries: experience from a tertiary care centre in India.', 'Equivalent Dose Rate 1 Meter from Neuroendocrine Tumor Patients Exiting the Nuclear Medicine Department After Undergoing Imaging.', 'Radiation Safety and Accidental Radiation Exposures in Nuclear Medicine.', 'Occupational exposure in the work process of radiology technologists with 68Ga-labeled radiopharmaceuticals.']"""

IL8 secretion is also implicated in prostate cancer progression and castration resistance. We used RNA in situ hybridization to localize IL1β, IL6, IL8, and IL10 mRNA in low- and high-grade prostate cancer from African American and European American men. IL8 was the most abundantly expressed and the only interleukin detected in tumor cells. We further interrogated IL8 expression in primary and metastatic prostate cancer tissue microarrays and both androgen-dependent and castration-resistant patient-derived xenografts (PDX). IL8 was significantly increased in both tumor and benign regions of higher grade cases (ISUP Grade Group 4-5), but there was no difference between races. We determined that IL8 expression in prostate cancer cell lines, distant metastases, and PDX lines was associated with androgen receptor (AR) loss, but not castration resistance. Reciprocal IL8 and AR expression was also observed in high IL8-expressing atrophy lesions with simultaneous AR downregulation. Finally, we show that IL8 is likely repressed by AR binding to the IL8 promoter and is inducible in prostate cancer cells stimulated with lipopolysaccharide only in cells with AR loss. Likewise, AR knockdown in androgen-dependent cells induced IL8 expression, further demonstrating that AR represses IL8 expression. In conclusion, IL8 expression in the tumor microenvironment is associated with aggressive prostate cancer and with AR loss in metastatic disease. IMPLICATIONS: IL8 expression is repressed by AR and is associated with prostate cancer aggressiveness and AR loss in metastatic disease.""","""['Janielle P Maynard', 'Onur Ertunc', 'Ibrahim Kulac', 'Javier A Baena-Del Valle', 'Angelo M De Marzo', 'Karen S Sfanos']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Mol Cancer Res""","""['Interleukin-8 is a molecular determinant of androgen independence and progression in prostate cancer.', 'The androgen receptor negatively regulates the expression of c-Met: implications for a novel mechanism of prostate cancer progression.', 'Protein kinase A (PKA) pathway is functionally linked to androgen receptor (AR) in the progression of prostate cancer.', 'Androgen receptor-dependent and -independent mechanisms driving prostate cancer progression: Opportunities for therapeutic targeting from multiple angles.', 'Androgen receptor and prostate cancer stem cells: biological mechanisms and clinical implications.', 'Immunologic Assessment of Tumors from a Race-matched Military Cohort Identifies Mast Cell Depletion as a Marker of Prostate Cancer Progression.', 'Stromal cell-derived small extracellular vesicles enhance radioresistance of prostate cancer cells via interleukin-8-induced autophagy.', 'IL-8 Produced Via Bidirectional Communication Between Prostate Cancer and M2 Macrophages as a Potential Diagnostic and Prognostic Biomarker.', 'Obesity and prostate cancer - microenvironmental roles of adipose tissue.', 'Osteoid cell-derived chemokines drive bone-metastatic prostate cancer.']"""

Methods and materials:   Between August 2010 and April 2013, 76 patients with intermediate-risk prostate carcinoma were included in the study. A first course delivered 46 Gy using conventional fractionation. The second course delivered a boost of 18 Gy (3 × 6 Gy) within 10 days using stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT). Gastrointestinal and genitourinary toxicities were assessed according to the National Cancer Institute's Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v4.0. Secondary outcome measures were overall, biochemical relapse-free, and relapse-free survival; prostate-specific antigen kinetics; and patient functional status (urinary and sexual) according to the International Index of Erectile Function and International Prostate Symptom Score questionnaires.  Results:   Sixty patients (79%) were treated by CyberKnife and 16 (21%) by linear accelerator. Median follow-up was 62 months (range, 29-69). The cumulative incidence of genitourinary and gastrointestinal grade ≥2 toxicities at month 60 after the end of radiation therapy was 1.4% (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.1%-6.6%) and 9.3% (95% CI, 4.1%-17.1%), respectively. Biochemical relapse-free and relapse-free survival rates at 5 years were 87.4% (95% CI, 77.1%-93.2%) and 86.2% (95% CI, 75.8-92.3), respectively. The mean (standard deviation) prostate-specific antigen variation within 3 months and 5 years post-radiation therapy was -1.20 ng/mL/mo (0.79) and -1.30 ng/mL/y (1.05), respectively. There was no significant difference between the International Prostate Symptom quality of life score between inclusion and month 60. For the International Index of Erectile Function, there was a significant difference between inclusion and month 60 (P = .005), with a higher proportion of severe/noninterpretable disorders at 60 months.  Conclusions:   The results of the trial demonstrate that the EBRT and SBRT combination is well tolerated and yields good efficacy results.

Lupiwighteone has anticancer effects in prostate cancer cells and neuroblastoma cells. However, the molecular and cellular mechanisms of lupiwighteone effects on human breast cancer cells are not as well known. In the present study, we investigated the effects of lupiwighteone on the proliferation and apoptosis of two different human cancer cells; MCF-7, an estrogen receptor (ER)-positive human breast cancer cell, and MDA-MB-231, a triple negative human breast cancer cell. Lupiwighteone treatment decreased the viability of MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells. Lupiwighteone treatment resulted in apoptotic cell death in breast cancer cells, which was characterized by DNA fragmentation, accumulation of apoptotic cells, and nuclear condensation. We also showed that treatment with lupiwighteone induced caspase-dependent apoptosis (up-regulation of caspase-3, -7, -8, -9, PARP, and Bax or down-regulation of Bid, Bcl-2), induction of caspase-independent apoptosis (up-regulation of AIF and Endo G on cytosol), and inhibition of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway (down-regulation of PI3K, p-Akt, and p-mTOR) in both MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells.

Findings from a supramaximal verification test""","""Cancer survivors demonstrate a reduced maximal oxygen uptake, which is clinically relevant in terms of overall survival. However, it remains uncertain whether they attain their ""true maximal oxygen uptake"" in a cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET). In the present study, a supramaximal verification bout (Verif) was applied in cancer survivors to confirm attainment of maximal oxygen uptake. Seventy-five participants (age, 61 ± 12 years; n = 43 females with breast cancer and n = 32 males with prostate cancer, 6-52 weeks after primary therapy) performed a CPET on a cycle ergometer and a Verif at 110% peak power output. As verification criterion, maximal oxygen uptake in Verif should not exceed maximal oxygen uptake in CPET by >3%. On average, maximal oxygen uptake was significantly lower in Verif compared with CPET (1.60 ± 0.38 L·min-1 vs. 1.65 ± 0.36 L·min-1, p = .023). On the individual level, n = 51 (68%) satisfied the verification criterion, whereas n = 24 (32%) demonstrated a higher maximal oxygen uptake in Verif. n = 69 (92%) fulfilled ≥2 secondary criteria for maximal exhaustion in the CPET. While maximal oxygen uptake was not underestimated in the CPET on average, one-third of cancer survivors did not attain their true maximal oxygen uptake. Verif appears feasible and beneficial to confirm true maximal oxygen uptake in this population. Furthermore, it might be more reliable than secondary criteria for maximal exhaustion. Novelty In about one-third of cancer survivors, maximal oxygen uptake is underestimated by a CPET. This underestimation of maximal oxygen uptake is not necessarily indicated by secondary criteria for maximal exhaustion. A supramaximal verification bout appears feasible and helpful for the determination of maximal oxygen uptake in cancer survivors.""","""['Justine Schneider', 'Kathrin Schlüter', 'Joachim Wiskemann', 'Friederike Rosenberger']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Appl Physiol Nutr Metab""","""['Utility of Verification Testing to Confirm Attainment of Maximal Oxygen Uptake in Unhealthy Participants: A Perspective Review.', 'Is a verification phase useful for confirming maximal oxygen uptake in apparently healthy adults?

Methods:   We identified 106 men treated at Mayo Clinic from 2004 to 2008 with pathological Gleason grade group 4 to 5 or seminal vesicle invasion at RP. Univariable and multivariable Cox models were used to test the association between standard predictors (Kattan nomogram and GPSM [Gleason, PSA, seminal vesicle and margin status] score), kallikrein panel, and individual kallikrein markers with the outcomes.  Results:   BCR and metastasis occurred in 67 and 30 patients, respectively. The median follow-up for patients who did not develop a BCR was 10.3 years (interquartile range = 8.2-11.8). In this high-risk group, neither Kattan risk, GPSM score, or the kallikrein panel model was associated with either outcome. However, after adjusting for Kattan risk and GPSM score, separately, preoperative intact PSA was associated with both outcomes while hK2 was associated with metastasis-free survival.  Conclusions:   Conventional risk prediction tools were poor discriminators for risk of adverse outcomes after RP (Kattan risk and GPSM risk) in patients with very high-risk disease.

Methods:   Thirty consecutive patients who received Lu-177 PSMA treatment for their castration-resistant prostate carcinoma were included. All the patients had undergone Ga-68 PSMA PET/CT scanning before Lu-177 PSMA therapy, which revealed multiple metastases. Patients were treated with a fixed dose (180 mCi) of Lu-177 PSMA at six to eight weeks intervals. PSA response was evaluated using Prostate Cancer Working Group 3 (PCWG3) criteria. Serum PSA response was classified as PSA progression (25% increase over the baseline and an increase in the absolute-value PSA level by at least 5 ng per millilitre), any <50% decline or ≥50% decline. PSA response was evaluated six weeks after every cycle. Response evaluation with radiological imaging and Ga-68 PSMA PET/CT were performed before the first cycle and eight weeks after the last cycle.  Results:   Thirty patients were treated with a total of 171 cycles (median 4, range 3-7) of Lu-177 PSMA. A decline in serum PSA of ≥50% was detected in ten patients (33%) while a decline in PSA of any amount was observed in fifteen (50%) patients after the first cycle. After the last cycle, a decline in PSA ≥50% and of any amount was seen in thirteen (43%) and fourteen (46%) patients, respectively. Of the fifteen patients who were not responder after the first cycle, three (20%) had a decline in PSA of any amount after the completion of the RLT. Moreover, of the 20 patients who did not have a ≥50% decline in PSA level after the first cycle, four (20%) became responder after the last cycle. Regarding serum PSA response after the first cycle, median OS was significantly higher for patients who had ≥50% decline in PSA level with 21.0±10.0 (95% CI: 1.2-40.7) months compared to patients who had not with 8.0±2.6 (95% CI: 2.7-13.2) months (P=0.012). A decline in PSA of any amount after the first cycle did not have a significant impact on median OS (12.0±1.1 vs. 6.0±2.5 months, P=0.08). The decline in serum PSA level after the last cycle of treatment had a significant impact on OS. Median OS for the decline in PSA of any amount was calculated as 13.0±1.0 (95% CI: 10.9-15.0) months for responders and 6.0±1.9 (95% CI: 2.2-9.7) months for non-responders (P=0.016). Considering ≥50% of decline as a response, median OS was 21.0±5.8 (95% CI: 9.5-32.4) months for responders and 6.0±3.0 (95% CI: 0.1-11.8) months for non-responders (P=0.026).  Conclusions:   Serum PSA level during RLT with Lu-177 PSMA remains a clinically significant factor to predict OS times. About twenty percent of patients who were not responder after the first cycle could become responder after the last cycle. However, patients without PSA response after completion of all cycles should be closely followed-up.

Twitter metrics (Twitter handle, date joined, # tweets, # followers, # following, likes) for programmes and physicians were catalogued (data capture: March-April 2019). Descriptive analyses and temporal trends in Twitter utilisation amongst programmes and physicians were assessed. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify predictors of Twitter use.  Results:   In all, 156 academic programmes (143 USA, 13 Canada) and 2214 academic faculty (2015 USA, 199 Canada) were identified. Twitter utilisation is currently 49.3% and 34.1% amongst programmes and physicians, respectively, and continues to increase. On multivariable analysis, programmes with 3-5 residents/year and programmes with a higher percentage of faculty Twitter engagement were more likely to have Twitter accounts. From a physician perspective, those with fellowship training, lower academic rank (Clinical Instructor, Assistant Professor, Associate Professor vs Professor) and higher H-indices were more likely to have individual Twitter accounts.  Conclusion:   There is a steady increase in Twitter engagement amongst Urology programmes and academic physicians. Faculty Twitter utilisation is an important driver of programme Twitter engagement. Twitter social media activity is strongly associated with academic productivity, and may in fact drive academic metrics. Within Urology, social media presence appears to be proportional to academic activity.""","""['Thenappan Chandrasekar', 'Hanan Goldberg', 'Zachary Klaassen', 'Christopher J D Wallis', 'Joon Yau Leong', 'Spencer Liem', 'Seth Teplitsky', 'Rodrigo Noorani', 'Stacy Loeb']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""BJU Int""","""['Setting the Standards: Examining Research Productivity Among Academic Urologists in the USA and Canada in 2019.', 'The Association of the H-Index and Academic Rank Among Full-Time Academic Hand Surgeons Affiliated With Fellowship Programs.', 'Top 100 Urology Influencers on Twitter: Is Social Media Influence Associated with Academic Impact?', 'Exponential use of social media in medicine: example of the interest of Twitter(©) in urology.', 'The effect of social media (#SoMe) on journal impact factor and parental awareness in paediatric urology.', 'Analyzing the growth in social media proliferation in academic urology.', 'Citation impact and social media visibility of Great Barrington and John Snow signatories for COVID-19 strategy.', 'Social media usage to share information in communication journals: An analysis of social media activity and article citations.', 'Audience of Academic Otolaryngology on Twitter: Cross-sectional Study.', 'Update on social media and otolaryngology: Pertinent positives and definite downsides.']"""

Results:   Among 54 taTME patients, 74.1% were male and 27.8% had a BMI ≥ 30. Tumors were stage I (8), II (13), III (29), and IV (4). Complex cases included 4 local recurrences, 4 prior liver resections, and 2 with prior prostate cancer. Thirty tumors were located ≤ 6 cm from the anal verge. On staging MRI, 12 had a positive predicted circumferential radial margin (+CRM), and 4 had internal anal sphincter involvement (+IAS). Forty-seven patients received neoadjuvant therapy. A 2-team approach was used in 51 patients with laparoscopic (83.3%) or robotic (16.7%) abdominal assistance with a 9.2% conversion rate. Low anterior resection with sphincter salvage was achieved in 87% with 8 patients requiring intersphincteric resection. Anastomoses were hand-sewn in 57.4% and all patients were diverted. Median LOS was 5 days with a 42.6% 30-day morbidity rate and 3 postoperative mortalities (ARDS, pulmonary embolism and pseudomembranous colitis). Complete and near complete TME grade was achieved in 94.4% with a 3.7% rate of +CRM.

The aim of this bicentric prospective study was to compare the detection rates of MRI/TRUS fusion targeted biopsy (TG) and systematic biopsy (SB), and the detection rates of examiners with different levels of previous experience in prostate biopsy.  Methods:   A total of 419 patients underwent MRI based on a suspicion of prostate cancer with elevated PSA levels. MRI was positive in 395 patients (221 in the first biopsy group [FB] and 174 in the repeated biopsy group [RB]). A subsequent TG, followed by a SB, was performed on these patients by four different examiners.  Results:   In the detection of clinically significant prostate cancer, a significant difference was found for TG+SB against SB in the RB group (35.1% vs. 25.3%, P=0.047). In the detection of clinically insignificant prostate cancer, the SB had a significantly higher detection rate than TG in both subgroups (FB: 11.9% vs. 4.7%, P=0.008; RB: 13.8% vs. 6.9%, P=0.034). A significant difference was found between the four examiners in the FB for TG (P=0.028), SB (P=0.036), and TG+SB (P=0.017).

This is a hypothetical measure and is interpreted as excluding the possibility of cancer patients dying from other causes. Crude probability of death partitions the all-cause probability of death into deaths from cancer and other causes.  Methods:   The National Cancer Registration and Analysis Service is the single cancer registry for England. In 2006-2015, 1,590,477 malignant tumours were diagnosed for breast, colorectal, lung, melanoma and prostate cancer in adults. We used a relative survival framework, with a period approach, providing estimates for up to 10-year survival. Mortality was partitioned into deaths due to cancer or other causes. Unconditional and conditional (on surviving 1-years and 5-years) crude probability of death were estimated for the five cancers.  Results:   Elderly patients who survived for a longer period before dying were more likely to die from other causes of death (except for lung cancer). For younger patients, deaths were almost entirely due to the cancer.  Conclusion:   There are different measures of survival, each with their own strengths and limitations.

Although this radiopharmaceutical was produced mostly by means of manual synthesis and automated synthesis modules, a sterile cold kit was recently introduced. The aim of our study was to evaluate the image quality of 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT (PSMA-PET) in a population of PCa patients after the injection of comparable activities of 68Ga-PSMA-11 obtained with the 2 different synthetic procedures. A secondary aim was to identify secondary factors that may have an impact on image quality and, thus, final interpretation. Methods: Two different groups of 100 consecutive PCa patients who underwent PSMA-PET were included in the study. The first group of patients was imaged with 68Ga-PSMA-11 obtained using synthesis modules, whereas the second group's tracer activity was synthesized using a sterile cold kit. All PET images were independently reviewed by 2 nuclear medicine diagnosticians with at least 2 y of experience in PSMA-based imaging and unaware of the patients' clinical history. The 2 reviewers independently rated the quality of each PSMA-PET scan using a 3-point Likert-type scale. In cases of discordance, the operators together reviewed the images and reached a consensus. Performance was evaluated on the basis of the expected biodistribution, lesion detection rate, and physiologic background uptake. Results: Overall, 104 of 200 (52%) PSMA-PET scans were positive for PCa-related findings. No significant differences in image quality between cold kits and synthesis modules were found (P = 0.13), although a higher proportion of images was rated as excellent by the observers for kits than for modules (45% vs. 34%). Furthermore, after image quality had been dichotomized as excellent or not excellent, multivariate regression analysis found several factors to be significantly associated with a not-excellent quality: an increase in patient age (+5 y: odds ratio [OR], 1.40; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.12-1.75), an increase in patient weight (+5 kg: OR, 1.89; 95% CI, 1.53-2.32), an increase in 68Ga-PSMA-11 uptake time (+10 min: OR, 1.45; 95% CI, 1.08-1.96), and a decrease in injected activity (-10 MBq: OR, 1.28; 95% CI, 1.07-1.52). Conclusion: No significant differences were identified between the 2 groups of patients undergoing PSMA-PET; therefore, we were not able to ascertain any significant influences of tracer production methodology on final scan quality. However, increased patient age, increased patient weight, decreased injected activity, and increased 68Ga-PSMA-11 uptake time were significantly associated with an overall poorer image quality.""","""['Letizia Calderoni', 'Andrea Farolfi', 'Davide Pianori', 'Elisa Maietti', 'Veronica Cabitza', 'Alessandro Lambertini', 'Giacomo Ricci', 'Silvi Telo', 'Filippo Lodi', 'Paolo Castellucci', 'Stefano Fanti']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""J Nucl Med""","""['Optimal time-point for 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT imaging in assessment of prostate cancer: feasibility of sterile cold-kit tracer preparation?', 'More advantages in detecting bone and soft tissue metastases from prostate cancer using 18F-PSMA PET/CT.', '68GaGa-P16-093 as a PSMA-Targeted PET Radiopharmaceutical for Detection of Cancer: Initial Evaluation and Comparison with 68GaGa-PSMA-11 in Prostate Cancer Patients Presenting with Biochemical Recurrence.', 'Sensitivity, Specificity, and Predictors of Positive 68Ga-Prostate-specific Membrane Antigen Positron Emission Tomography in Advanced Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.', 'PET/CT With 68Ga-PSMA in Prostate Cancer: Radiopharmaceutical Background and Clinical Implications.', 'Radiometallation and photo-triggered release of ready-to-inject radiopharmaceuticals from the solid phase.', 'Cold Kit Labeling: The Future of 68Ga Radiopharmaceuticals?', 'AAZTA-Derived Chelators for the Design of Innovative Radiopharmaceuticals with Theranostic Applications.', 'Oligometastatic Disease Detection with 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT in Hormone-Sensitive Prostate Cancer Patients (HSPC) with Biochemical Recurrence after Radical Prostatectomy: Predictive Factors and Clinical Impact.', 'The Pharmaceutical Technology Approach on Imaging Innovations from Italian Research.']"""

There is a subgroup of patients with poor response despite sufficient expression of PSMA in their tumors. The aim of this work was to characterize PSMA-TAT-nonresponding lesions by targeted next-generation sequencing. Methods: Of 60 patients treated with 225Ac-PSMA-617, we identified 10 patients who presented with a poor response despite sufficient tumor uptake in PSMA PET/CT. We were able to perform CT-guided biopsies with histologic validation of the nonresponding lesions in 7 of these nonresponding patients. Specimens were analyzed by targeted next-generation sequencing interrogating 37 DNA damage-repair-associated genes. Results: In the 7 tumor samples analyzed, we found a total of 15 whole-gene deletions, deleterious or presumably deleterious mutations affecting TP53 (n = 3), CHEK2 (n = 2), ATM (n = 2), and BRCA1, BRCA2, PALB2, MSH2, MSH6, NBN, FANCB, and PMS1 (n = 1 each). The average number of deleterious or presumably deleterious mutations was 2.2 (range, 0-6) per patient. In addition, several variants of unknown significance in ATM, BRCA1, MSH2, SLX4, ERCC, and various FANC genes were detected. Conclusion: Patients with resistance to PSMA-TAT despite PSMA positivity frequently harbor mutations in DNA damage-repair and checkpoint genes.

The synthesized radioconjugates with either an incorporated CC inhibitor or a matching control were examined using in vitro and in vivo models of the GRPR-positive, PC-3 human prostate cancer cell line. Results: From the in vitro studies, multiple techniques confirmed that the CC-trapping, GRPR-targeted constructs were able to increase cellular retention by forming intracellular macromolecule adducts. In PC-3 tumor-bearing xenograft mice, the CC-trapping, GRPR-targeted agonistic and antagonistic constructs led to an approximately 2-fold increase in tumor retention with a corresponding improvement in most tumor-to-nontarget tissue ratios over 72 h.

The aim of this study was to provide the most recent detailed international epidemiological comparison of prostate cancer incidence and mortality in six north-eastern European countries (Belarus, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, the Russian Federation and Ukraine).  Methods:   The number of incident prostate cancer cases was obtained from the countries national cancer registries. Prostate cancer mortality and corresponding population data were extracted from the WHO Mortality Database. Age-specific and age-standardised incidence and mortality rates were calculated (European Standard). The joinpoint regression model was used to provide an average annual percentage change and to detect points in time where significant changes in trends occurred. The observation period was between 13 (Ukraine) and 48 (Estonia) years regarding incidence and around 30 years regarding mortality.  Results:   The comparison of prostate cancer incidence in six European countries showed almost sixfold differences in the age-adjusted rates in most recent years with highest incidence rates in Lithuania and Estonia. Through the observation period, overall a continuous rise was seen in incidence in all countries and a continuous rise in mortality, with a stabilisation in Estonia and a decrease in Lithuania in recent years. Data limitations included a descriptive design using ecological data.  Conclusions:   A widespread use of PSA testing seems to be responsible for the changes in the epidemiology of the disease in north-eastern European countries. Substantial variation in the incidence of prostate cancer in the Baltic states suggests the possibility that PSA performance and utilisation spread have had a major influence on observed incidence trends, with a lack of effect on prostate cancer mortality.""","""['Ausvydas Patasius', 'Kaire Innos', 'Anton Barchuk', 'Anton Ryzhov', 'Marcis Leja', 'Janis Misins', 'Alesya Yaumenenka', 'Giedre Smailyte']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""BMJ Open""","""['Induced abortions and childbirths: trends in Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Russia, Belarussia and the Ukraine during 1970 to 1994.', 'Prostate cancer incidence and mortality trends in 37 European countries: an overview.', 'Several aspects of descriptive epidemiology of hematological malignancies in adult population of Ukraine, Belarus and Russian Federation after Chornobyl accident.', 'Trends in cervical cancer incidence and mortality in the Baltic countries, Bulgaria and Romania.', 'Recent Global Patterns in Prostate Cancer Incidence and Mortality Rates.', 'Global burden of prostate cancer attributable to smoking among males in 204 countries and territories, 1990-2019.', 'Serum PSA-based early detection of prostate cancer in Europe and globally: past, present and future.', 'All-Cause Mortality Risk in National Prostate Cancer Cohort: An Impact of Population-Based Prostate Cancer Screening.', ""Prostate Cancer Screening with PSA: Ten Years' Experience of Population Based Early Prostate Cancer Detection Programme in Lithuania."", 'Changing Incidence and Stage Distribution of Prostate Cancer in a Lithuanian Population-Evidence from National PSA-Based Screening Program.']"""

Design:   Using the standardized CellSearch® system that allows for the detection of single epithelial cell adhesion molecule-positive circulating tumor cells (CTCs) in blood, we investigated whether prostate biopsy is associated with release of prostatic tumor cells into the circulation. Peripheral blood was obtained before and within 30 min after performing prostate biopsy from 115 men with increased serum prostate-specific antigen.  Results:   The number of CTCs significantly increased after biopsy in men with histologically confirmed prostate cancer (odds ratio, 7.8; 95% CI, 4.8-12.8), whereas no biopsy-related changes could be detected in men without confirmed prostate cancer.

Objective:   To establish treatment duration and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response of ART2 in real-world mCRPC patients treated with or without other life-prolonging drugs (LPDs; ie, docetaxel, cabazitaxel, or radium-223) between ART1 and ART2.  Design, setting, and participants:   Castration-resistant prostate cancer patients, diagnosed between 2010 and 2016 were retrospectively registered in Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer Registry (CAPRI). Patients treated with both ARTs were clustered into two subgroups: ART1>ART2 or ART1>LPD>ART2.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Outcomes were ≥50% PSA response and treatment duration of ART2. Descriptive statistics and binary logistic regression after multiple imputations were performed.  Results and limitations:   A total of 273 patients were included with a median follow-up of 8.4 mo from ART2. Patients with ART1>ART2 were older and had favourable prognostic characteristics at ART2 baseline compared with patients with ART1>LPD>ART2. No differences between ART1>ART2 and ART1>LPD>ART2 were found in PSA response and treatment duration. Multivariate analysis suggested that PSA response of ART2 was less likely in patients with visceral metastases (odds ratio [OR] 0.143, p=0.04) and more likely in patients with a relatively longer duration of androgen-deprivation treatment (OR 1.028, p=0.01) and with ABI + P before ENZ (OR 3.192, p=0.02). A major limitation of this study was missing data, a common problem in retrospective observational research.  Conclusions:   The effect of ART2 seems to be low, with a low PSA response rate and a short treatment duration irrespective of interposed chemotherapy or radium-223, especially in patients with short time on castration, visceral disease, and ENZ before ABI+P.

Methods:   We retrospectively included 215 CaP patients received multiparametric MRIexamination, targeted biopsy (TB) combined with systematic biopsy (SB), radical prostatectomy and final Gleason group 2 or 3. Cribriform status was confirmed on both biopsy slices and whole-mount sections. Characteristics were stratified by cribriform status. Mann Whitney U test was performed for continuous variables and the χ2 test for categorical variables. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed for significant predictors, followed by cribriform-risk nomogram construction. Receiver operating characteristic analysis was used for internal discrimination validation with corresponding area under the curve. Calibration curves were plotted and decision curve analysis was performed for clinical benefit exploration.  Results:   Cribriform morphology was identified in 51.2% (110/215) patients. Cribriform-positive CaP demonstrated significantly higher prostate-specific antigen level, higher prostate-specific antigen density , larger lesion dimension on MRI, higher Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System score, larger tumor dimension, higher Gleason score, higher pT stage, higher pN stage and more positive surgical margin (all P < 0.01). Sensitivities of TB, SB, TB + SB for detecting cribriform morphology were 28.2% (31/110), 22.7% (25/110), and 36.4% (40/110), respectively. Further, prostate-specific antigen density (P = 0.003), Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System score (P < 0.001), and maximal biopsy Gleason score (P = 0.004) were independent predictors for positive cribriform morphology.

Study aim:   To evaluate the impact of a previous radical prostatectomy (RP) on the outcome of 223Ra therapy in mCRPC patients. The primary prostate tumor left untreated could progress during 223Ra treatment.  Materials and methods:   mCRPC symptomatic patients treated with 223Ra were enrolled. Luteinizing Hormone-Releasing Hormone analogue was maintained. No other anticancer therapy was given. 223Ra was administered i.v. at the dose of 55 kBq/kg every 4 weeks for 6 cycles. Patients were stratified according to previous RP or not. Hematological toxicity was monitored. Statistical analysis of 223Ra discontinuations, progressions, and deaths were performed.  Results:   Forty-four patients were enrolled, 16 (36.4%) previously received RP, 5 (11.3%) prostate radiotherapy and 23 (52.3%) maintained the primary prostate tumor after local treatment. All patients presented only bone metastases, 24 patients (54.5%) had more than 20. Twenty-six (59.1%) patients were treated after first or second line systemic chemotherapy. Treatment interruptions occurred in 14 patients (50%) with prostate and in 4 (25%) without (P = 0.04).

Anal canal dose-volume histogram was used to determine the prescribed dose. Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to evaluate the risk of AAT as a function of clinical and dosimetric factors.  Results:   Totally, 39.5% (98/248) and 31.3% (31/99) of the PCa patients developed AAT in training and validation cohorts, respectively. The incidence of AAT was much higher in patients with hemorrhoids than in those without hemorrhoids in both training and validation cohorts. Hemorrhoids and volume received more than 20 Gy (V20) were valuated as independent factors for predicting AAT in training cohort. Similar results were also observed in our validation cohort. The combination of hemorrhoids and high anal canal V20 (> 74.93% as determined by ROC curves) showed the highest specificity and positive predictive values for predicting AAT in both training and validation cohorts.

Here, we applied a network pharmacology approach to explore the potential mechanisms of HDW against prostate cancer (PCa). We obtained 14 active compounds from HDW and 295 potential PCa related targets in total to construct a network, which indicated that quercetin and ursolic acid served as the main ingredients in HDW. Mitogen-activated Protein Kinase 8 (MAPK8), Interleukin 6 (IL6), Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A (VEGFA), Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 3 (STAT3), Jun Proto-Oncogene (JUN), C-X-C Motif Chemokine Ligand 8 (CXCL8), Interleukin-1 Beta (IL1B), Matrix Metalloproteinase-9 (MMP9), C-C Motif Chemokine Ligand 2 (CCL2), RELA Proto-Oncogene (RELA), and CAMP Responsive Element Binding Protein 1 (CREB1) were identified as key targets of HDW in the treatment of PCa. The protein-protein interaction (PPI) cluster demonstrated that CREB1 was the seed in this cluster, indicating that CREB1 plays an important role in connecting other nodes in the PPI network. This enrichment demonstrated that HDW was highly related to translesion synthesis, unfolded protein binding, regulation of mitotic recombination, phosphatidylinositol and its kinase-mediated signaling, nucleotide excision repair, regulation of DNA recombination, and DNA topological change. The enrichment results also showed that the underlying mechanism of HDW against PCa may be due to its coordinated regulation of several cancer-related pathways, such as angiogenesis, cell differentiation, migration, apoptosis, invasion, and proliferation.""","""['Yanan Song', 'Haiyan Wang', 'Yajing Pan', 'Tonghua Liu']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Biomolecules""","""['The anti-tumor effect and bioactive phytochemicals of Hedyotis diffusa willd on ovarian cancer cells.', 'Hedyotis diffusa Willd suppresses metastasis in 5‑fluorouracil‑resistant colorectal cancer cells by regulating the TGF‑β signaling pathway.', 'Hedyotis\xa0diffusa Willd inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis of 5‑FU resistant colorectal cancer cells by regulating the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway.', 'Isolation, purification, structural characteristics, pharmacological activities, and combined action of Hedyotis diffusa polysaccharides: A review.', 'Chemical and preclinical studies on Hedyotis diffusa with anticancer potential.', 'Determining the mechanism of action of the Qishan formula against lung adenocarcinoma by integration of network pharmacology, molecular docking, and proteomics.', 'Exploring the mechanism of action of Hedyotis diffusa Willd on acne using network analysis.', 'Analyzing the multi-target pharmacological mechanism of folium Artemisia argyi acting on breast cancer: a network pharmacology approach.', 'Network Pharmacology Analysis and Experimental Verification on Antiangiogenesis Mechanism of Hedyotis diffusa Willd in Liver Cancer.', 'Total flavonoids of Oldenlandia diffusa (Willd.)

However, currently available exosomal miRNA and protein detection methods are time consuming, expensive, and laborious. Meanwhile, simultaneous detection of an exosomal miRNA and protein in a single reaction is even more challenging. Thus, development of an efficient method for detecting multiple miRNAs and proteins in a single exosomal reaction is highly needed. Herein, to increase the value of using exosomes over other circulating biomarkers for prostate cancer (PCa) liquid biopsy, a method for simultaneous multiplexed in situ detection of exosomal miRNAs and proteins was developed. Exosomal miRNAs and surface proteins were simultaneously detected in captured exosomes with a high specificity, using nano-sized molecular beacons and fluorescent dye-conjugated antibodies. The method allowed the quantitative analysis of various disease-specific miRNAs and surface proteins in PCa cell-derived exosomes in a single exosomal reaction.

DNA damage was assessed using immunofluorescent staining of γH2AX and the Comet assay. The homologous recombination repair (HRR) was determined using a plasmid-based HRR reporter assay and the nucleotide excision repair (NER) was indirectly examined by the removal of UV-induced cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPD). We found that PCNA-I1S inhibited cell growth in a dose-dependent manner and significantly enhanced the cell growth inhibition induced by pretreatment with DNA damaging agents Cs-137 irradiation, UV-C, and cisPt. However, the additive growth inhibitory effects were not observed in cells pre-treated with PCNA-I1S, followed by treatment with cisPt. H2O2 enhanced the level of chromatin-bound PCNA in quiescent cells, which was attenuated by PCNA-I1S. DNA damage was induced in cells treated with either PCNA-I1S or cisPt alone and was significantly elevated in cells exposed to the combination of PCNA-I1S and cisPt. Finally, PCNA-I1S attenuated repair of DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) by HRR and the removal of CPD by NER. These data suggest that targeting PCNA with PCNA-I1S may provide a novel approach for enhancing the efficacy of chemotherapy and radiation therapy in treatment of human prostate and lung cancer.""","""['Shan Lu', 'Zhongyun Dong']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Antitumor effects of a novel small molecule targeting PCNA chromatin association in prostate cancer.', 'P21Cip1/WAF1 downregulation is required for efficient PCNA ubiquitination after UV irradiation.', 'Oxidative damage-induced PCNA complex formation is efficient in xeroderma pigmentosum group A but reduced in Cockayne syndrome group B cells.', 'Detection of chromatin-bound PCNA in mammalian cells and its use to study DNA excision repair.', 'Targeting Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen (PCNA) as an Effective Strategy to Inhibit Tumor Cell Proliferation.', 'Proliferating cell nuclear antigen inhibitors block distinct stages of herpes simplex virus infection.', 'Roles of trans-lesion synthesis (TLS) DNA polymerases in tumorigenesis and cancer therapy.', 'NKp44-Derived Peptide Used in Combination Stimulates Antineoplastic Efficacy of Targeted Therapeutic Drugs.', 'Characterization of the Interaction Between SARS-CoV-2 Membrane Protein (M) and Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen (PCNA) as a Potential Therapeutic Target.', 'Precision Oncology with Drugs Targeting the Replication Stress, ATR, and Schlafen 11.']"""

Methods:   We examined the medical records of mCRPC patients who had undergone 177Lu-PSMA-617 PRLT from March 2017 to February 2019 in our institute. Patients receiving equal to or more than two cycles were included and analyzed in this retroprospective study.The 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET-CT and 18-fludeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (18FDG PET)-CT scan findings, serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) change, health-related quality of life (HRQoL) scales (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group/Karnofsky score) and Gleason score were assessed for their implications on the outcome of therapy. The treatment response was evaluated under three categories: (a) symptomatic (b) biochemical and (c) imaging response.The PFS and OS following first PRLT were determined and the association of various variables with PSA doubling time (DT) and FDG uptake in the lesions were analyzed. Toxicity assessment was undertaken objectively by National Cancer Institute-Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events scale v. 5.0 for haematological and nephrotoxicity, and salivary gland toxicity assessed by xerostomia inventory score.  Results:   A total of 40 mCRPC patients (age range: 46-84 years; median 63 years), who had undergone 177Lu-PSMA-617 PRLT, of at least two cycles was identified and selected for the analysis. FDG uptake was noted in 87.5% of patients (n = 35). Out of 40 cases, 21 were responders (CR, PR and SD) and 19 were non-responders (PD) on symptomatic and biochemical scales while on molecular imaging response, 16 (43%) were responders and remaining 21 (57%) were non-responders. Lesion-wise, 68Ga-PSMA-11 avid metastatic nodal disease responded well with 177Lu PSMA-617 PRLT, as compared to hepatic and skeletal lesions. The median OS and PFS was 12 and 7 months respectively following first PRLT. Patients with negative serum PSA-DT demonstrated superior 1 year PFS as compared to those with positive serum PSA-DT (52.5 vs 47.5%) (p = 0.029). Patients receiving greater than two cycles PRLT demonstrated a higher negative PSA-DT as compared to those receiving two cycles (p-value = 0.03). Grade 1 xerostomia was observed in two patients (5%) (mean xerostomia score of 23), haematotoxicity in seven patients [Grade I (n = 2, 5%) and Grade II (n = 5, 14%)].  Conclusion: 177Lu-PSMA-617 PRLT was well-tolerated and able to produce disease control with good symptomatic and biochemical responses in the context of heavily pre-treated mCRPC with progressive disease, with low toxicity profile. Evident association of high FDG uptake was observed with aggressive disease biology coupled with increasing Gleason score and poorer 12 months PFS. Negative PSA-DT following therapy demonstrated longer PFS. The results demonstrate important future role of 177Lu-PSMA-617 PRLT in the treatment of mCRPC.  Advances in knowledge:   The present work explored in a large teriary cancer care setting, the efficacy of 177Lu-PSMA-617 PRLT, in an aggressive and unselected subset of mCRPC.

However, these secondary electronic health record sources are often limited in scope because they do not capture the clinical information needed to understand complex clinical questions. Thus, we evaluated the effect of additional curation of data.  Materials and methods:   Clinical data sets of 149 patients with prostate cancer with biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy treated with salvage or palliative radiotherapy between 2008 and 2017 from our institutional cDWH and Gießener Tumor Documentation System (GTDS) were linked (data warehouse [DWH] population) for analyzing treatment outcomes. The linked data sets were manually curated (manual postprocessing [MPP], eg, incorporate data from established urologists). The primary outcomes were the impact on data quality of treatment outcomes and the time spent on data curation.  Results:   We obtained significantly more information on disease progression and patient survival (nonsignificant) when using curated data; the biochemical progression-free survival rate at 5 years for the DWH and DWH plus MPP populations was 63% v 30% (P ≤ .001) and the overall survival rate was 84% v 81% (P = .479), respectively. The median deviation of completeness and the median concordance of clinical data values were 21.47% (range, 55.38%-100%) and 95.00% (range, 63.40%-100%), respectively. We spent 121 hours, 42 minutes on data curation, with most time required for laboratory values, accounting, for a total of 45 hours, 20 minutes (37.26%).  Conclusion:   Our analysis indicates that time-to-event outcomes for patients with prostate cancer cannot be extracted using secondary data sources (cDWH plus GTDS) only. Outcomes data differed between the electronic data (DWH) and the second manual extraction (DWH plus MPP) because of a lack of follow-up data.

Long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) TTN-AS1 has been reported as an oncogene in diverse cancers. This study aimed to explore the functions and mechanism of TTN-AS1 in PCa.  Materials and methods:   The levels of TTN-AS1 and miR-193a-5p in PCa cells (DU145, PC3, 22RV1, C4-2B, and LNCaP) were measured by qRT-PCR. The putative target of TTN-AS1 was predicted by starBase v2.0 online database, and this interaction was validated by Dual-Luciferase reporter assay. The cell viability and apoptosis rate in DU145 and PC3 cells were assessed by MTT assay and flow cytometry, respectively. The protein levels of CyclinD1, p21, p27, Bcl-2, Bax, and cleaved-caspase3 were detected by Western blot.  Results:   The relative expression of TTN-AS1 was apparently up-regulated, and the level of miR-193a-5p was strikingly down-regulated in PCa cells. The interaction between TTN-AS1 and miR-193a-5p was predicted by starBase v2.0 online database and verified by Dual-Luciferase reporter assay. The functional experiments indicated that TTN-ASI knockdown or miR-193a-5p inhibited cell viability and induced cell apoptosis rate in DU145 and PC3 cells. Furthermore, the recuperated experiments exhibited that miR-193a-5p inhibitor counteracted the inhibitory effect on cell viability and the promotion effect on cell apoptosis rate in DU145 and PC3 cells induced by TTN-AS1 silencing.  Conclusions:   These data indicated that TTN-AS1 was dramatically up-regulated, and miR-193a-5p was significantly down-regulated in PCa cells.

Patients and methods:   Quantitative Real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was performed to detect the expression of EHMT2 in 55 pairs of PCa tissues and adjacent normal tissues. The relationship between EHMT2 expression and the pathological features, as well as the prognosis of PCa patients was analyzed. EHMT2 expression in PCa cells was determined by qRT-PCR as well. In addition, EHMT2 knockdown model was constructed by transfection of the small interfering RNA in PCa cell lines PC-3 and DU-145. The regulatory effects of EHMT2 on the behaviors of PCa cells were evaluated through cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8), 5-Ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine (EdU), colony formation assay and flow cytometry. Finally, we detected the protein levels of relative genes in PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway through Western blot.  Results:   QRT-PCR results showed that the expression level of EHMT2 in PCa tissues was markedly higher than that in adjacent normal tissues. Compared with PCa patients with low expression of EHMT2, those with high expression of EHMT2 had higher pathological grade and lower overall survival. EHMT2 was also highly expressed in PCa cell lines. Knockdown of EHMT2 inhibited the proliferative potential and induced apoptosis of PCa cells. Western blot results revealed that PCa cells with EHMT2 knockdown presented downregulated p-PI3K, p-AKT and p-mTOR.

Patients and methods:   A total of 489 pre-biopsy multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) scans in consecutive patients were subject to prospective paired reporting using both Likert and PI-RADS v2 by expert uro-radiologists. Patients were offered biopsy for any Likert or PI-RADS score ≥4 or a score of 3 with PSA density ≥0.12 ng/mL/mL. Utility was evaluated in terms of proportion biopsied, and proportion of clinically significant and insignificant cancer detected (both overall and on a 'per score' basis). In those patients biopsied, the overall accuracy of each system was assessed by calculating total and partial area under the receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curves. The primary threshold of significance was Gleason ≥3 + 4. Secondary thresholds of Gleason ≥4 + 3, Ahmed/UCL1 (Gleason ≥4 + 3 or maximum cancer core length [CCL] ≥6 or total CCL≥6) and Ahmed/UCL2 (Gleason ≥3 + 4 or maximum CCL ≥4 or total CCL ≥6) were also used.  Results:   The median (interquartile range [IQR]) age was 66 (60-72) years and the median (IQR) prostate-specific antigen level was 7 (5-10) ng/mL. A similar proportion of men met the biopsy threshold and underwent biopsy in both groups (83.8% [Likert] vs 84.8% [PI-RADS v2]; P = 0.704). The Likert system predicted more clinically significant cancers than PI-RADS across all disease thresholds. Rates of insignificant cancers were comparable in each group. ROC analysis of biopsied patients showed that, although both scoring systems performed well as predictors of significant cancer, Likert scoring was superior to PI-RADS v2, exhibiting higher total and partial areas under the ROC curve.  Conclusions:   Both scoring systems demonstrated good diagnostic performance, with similar rates of decision to biopsy.

It is challenging to predict such disease state with the measured omics data, in particular when only a single sample is available.  Results:   In this study, we developed a novel approach, i.e. single-sample landscape entropy (SLE) method, to identify the tipping point during disease progression with only one sample data. Specifically, by evaluating the disorder of a network projected from a single-sample data, SLE effectively characterizes the criticality of this single sample network in terms of network entropy, thereby capturing not only the signals of the impending transition but also its leading network, i.e. dynamic network biomarkers. Using this method, we can characterize sample-specific state during disease progression and thus achieve the disease prediction of each individual by only one sample.

However, it is still unknown where these short mt-cfDNAs originate, and whether the length of mt-cfDNAs can be correlated with tumor burden and cancer progression. In this study, we first performed whole-genome sequencing analysis (WGS) of cfDNAs from a human tumor cell line-xenotransplantation mouse model and found that mt-cfDNAs released from transplanted tumor cells were shorter than the mouse counterpart. We next analyzed blood cfDNA samples from hepatocellular carcinoma and prostate cancer patients and found that mt-cfDNA lengths were inversely related to tumor size as well as the concentration of circulating tumor DNA.

The aim of our prospective randomized study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a prostate biopsy prophylaxis protocol using 2 vs. 3 fosfomycin doses.  Methods:   Two hundred and ninety-seven patients undergoing transrectal systematic ultrasound (US)-guided (n = 277) or transrectal fusion prostate biopsy (n = 20) were prospectively evaluated and randomized by date of birth, to receive 2 (even years, group A) versus 3 doses of fosfomycin (odd years, group B), and prospectively evaluated.  Results:   Two hundred and ninety-seven patients were randomized to group A (n = 162) or group B (n = 135). The 2 groups were comparable with respect to age, comorbidity, PSA value, prostate volume, operative time and urine culture results. Out of 297 patients, 44 (14.8%) developed complications after the procedure; 2.7% (8/297) of patients developed fever >38° requiring hospitalization (6 [3.7%] in group A and 2 [1.5%] in group B, p = 0.29). Patients who underwent fusion biopsy were more frequently readmitted in comparison with patients undergoing US-guided prostate biopsy (p = 0.000).

By incubating the AuNPs and the PSA specific aptamer prior to target addition, polyA Apt adsorbed on the gold nanoparticles and could bind the target while preventing non-specific interactions. Adsorbed polyA Apt on the AuNPs prevents aggregation of them by poly(diallyldimethylammoniumchloride) (PDDA). Upon the addition of PSA, it bind to the polyA Apt and induce the formation of a secondary structure. Therefore, interaction between polyA Apt and PDDA is repressed and PDDA induce the aggregation of the AuNPs. This analytical platform produces a remarkable optical signal in the absence and presence of PSA that accompanied by a color change from red to blue. This effect as a sensing strategy can be observed with naked eyes and quantified by colorimetry via measurement of the ratio of absorbances at 680 nm and 520 nm.

Patients and methods:   From 2012 to 2017, 154 patients (92 with unfavourable intermediate-risk or high-risk PCa) were treated with helical TomoTherapy delivering 43.8-45.2 Gy in eight fractions over 3 weeks. Of these, 73% received hormonotherapy (51% neoadjuvant).  Results:   The median (range) follow-up was 48 (19-84) months.

The TMPRSS2 and ERG junction of the fusion messenger RNA (mRNA) constitutes a cancer-specific target. Although docetaxel-based chemotherapy is the second line of therapy following development resistance to androgen ablation therapies, it is not curative. Therefore, the development of nontoxic novel monotherapies for targeting TE mRNA in PCa patients and for increasing the clinical efficacy of docetaxel treatment are needed.  Methods:   We evaluated multiple approaches to enhance the delivery of TE small interfering RNA (siRNA) containing liposomes including PEGylation, topical treatment with nitroglycerin (NG) to increase permeability and retention, and three different PEG modifications: folate, RGD cyclic peptide, and a bFGF fibroblast growth factor receptor-targeting peptide. The efficacy of the optimized TE siRNA liposome in combination with docetaxel was then evaluated in vivo with or without topical NG in vivo using a VCaP xenograft model. TE fusion protein knockdown in residual tumors was assessed using Western blotting and immunohistochemistry.  Results:   In vivo therapeutic targeting of TE fusion gene by systemic delivery of RGD-peptide-coated liposomal siRNA nanovectors led to sustained target silencing, suppressed tumor growth in xenograft models and enhanced the efficacy of docetaxel chemotherapy. Simultaneous application of the vasodilator NG to the skin further increased tissue the delivery of siRNA and enhanced target knockdown.

The objective of our study was to evaluate the utility of ferumoxytol-enhanced MR lymphography (MRL) in detection of metastatic lymph nodes (LNs) in patients with prostate, bladder, and kidney cancer. SUBJECTS AND METHODS. This phase 2 single-institution study enrolled patients with confirmed prostate (arm 1), bladder (arm 2), and kidney (arm 3) cancer and evidence of suspected LN involvement. Participants underwent ferumoxytol-enhanced MRL 24 and 48 hours after IV injection of 7.5 mg Fe/kg of ferumoxytol. A retrospective quantitative analysis was performed to determine the optimal timing for ferumoxytol-enhanced MRL using percentage change in normalized signal intensity (SI) from baseline to 24 and 48 hours after injection, which were estimated using the linear mixed-effects model in which time (24 vs 48 hours), diseases status, and time and disease status interaction were the fixed-effects independent variables. Differences in normalized SI values between subgroups of lesions were estimated by forming fixed-effects contrasts and tested by the Wald test. RESULTS. Thirty-nine patients (n = 30, arm 1; n = 6, arm 2; n = 3, arm 3) (median age, 65 years) with 145 LNs (metastatic, n = 100; benign, n = 45) were included. LN-based sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of ferumoxytol-enhanced MRL was 98.0%, 64.4%, 86.0%, and 93.5%, respectively. Sensitivity and specificity of ferumoxytol-enhanced MRL did not vary by LN size. Metastatic LNs showed a significantly higher percentage decrease of normalized SI on MRL at 24 hours after ferumoxytol injection than at 48 hours after ferumoxytol injection (p = 0.023), whereas the normalized SI values for nonmetastatic LNs were similar at both imaging time points (p = 0.260). CONCLUSION. Ferumoxytol-enhanced MRL shows high sensitivity in the detection of metastatic LNs in genitourinary cancers independent of LN size. The SI difference between benign and malignant LNs on ferumoxytol-enhanced MRL appears similar 24 and 48 hours after ferumoxytol injection, suggesting that imaging can be performed safely within 1 or 2 days of injection. Although ferumoxytol-enhanced MRL can be useful in settings without an available targeted PET agent, issues of iron overload and repeatability of ferumoxytol-enhanced MRL remain concerns for this method.""","""['Baris Turkbey', 'Marcin Czarniecki', 'Joanna H Shih', 'Stephanie A Harmon', 'Piyush K Agarwal', 'Andrea B Apolo', 'Deborah E Citrin', 'James L Gulley', 'Mukesh Harisinghani', 'Ravi A Madan', 'Adam R Metwalli', 'Edmond Paquette', 'Peter A Pinto', 'Soroush Rais-Bahrami', 'Lindsay S Rowe', 'Bradford J Wood', 'Paula M Jacobs', 'Liza Lindenberg', 'William Dahut', 'Peter L Choyke']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""AJR Am J Roentgenol""","""['A Phase I Dosing Study of Ferumoxytol for MR Lymphography at 3 T in Patients With Prostate Cancer.', 'Value of PET/CT and MR lymphography in treatment of prostate cancer patients with lymph node metastases.', 'Comparison of nodal risk formula and MR lymphography for predicting lymph node involvement in prostate cancer.', 'The Diagnostic Performance of MRI for Detection of Lymph Node Metastasis in Bladder and Prostate Cancer: An Updated Systematic Review and Diagnostic Meta-Analysis.', 'Magnetic resonance lymphography: a novel technique for lymph node assessment in gynecologic malignancies.', 'Comparative in vitro and in vivo Evaluation of Different Iron Oxide-Based Contrast Agents to Promote Clinical Translation in Compliance with Patient Safety.', 'IONPs-Based Medical Imaging in Cancer Care: Moving Beyond Traditional Diagnosis and Therapeutic Assessment.', 'Contrast-enhanced MR Angiography without Gadolinium-based Contrast Material: Clinical Applications Using Ferumoxytol.', 'The bright future of nanotechnology in lymphatic system imaging and imaging-guided surgery.', 'Repurposing ferumoxytol: Diagnostic and therapeutic applications of an FDA-approved nanoparticle.']"""

The aim of this study is to compare objectively 99mTc-MDP tracer uptake between DJD and osseous metastases of the spine using semi-quantitative assessment with SPECT SUV.  Methods:   Bone scan with SPECT/CT using 99mTc-MDP was performed in 34 patients diagnosed with prostate carcinoma. SPECT/CT was performed based on our institutional standard guidelines. SUVmax based on body weight in 238 normal vertebrae visualized on SPECT/CT was quantified as baseline. A total of 211 lesions in the spine were identified on bone scan. Lesions were characterized into DJD or bone metastases based on its morphology on low-dose CT. Semi-quantitative evaluation using SUVmax was then performed on 89 DJD and 122 metastatic bone lesions. As most of the bone lesions were small in volume, the effect of partial volume effect (PVE) on SUVmax was also assessed. The corrected SUVmax values were obtained based on the recovery coefficient (RC) method.  Results:   The mean SUVmax for normal vertebrae was 7.08 ± 1.97, 12.59 ± 9.01 for DJD and 36.64 ± 24.84 for bone metastases. The SUVmax of bone metastases was significantly greater than DJD (p value < 0.05). To assess for diagnostic accuracy, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was performed. The area under the curve (AUC) was found to be fairly high at 0.874 (95% CI 0.826-0.921). The cutoff SUVmax value ≥ 20 gave a sensitivity of 73.8% and specificity of 85.4% in differentiating bone metastases from DJD. The corrected SUVmax for both DJD and bone metastases was smaller with a mean of 6.82 ± 6.02 and 24.77 ± 20.61, respectively. The cutoff SUVmax value was also lower with a value of 10, which gave a sensitivity of 73.8% and specificity of 86.5%.  Conclusion:   SPECT SUVmax was significantly higher in bone metastases than DJD. Semi-quantitative assessment with SUVmax can complement qualitative analysis.

In multivariate analysis, this association persisted and surgical margin (SM) was found to be a significant BCR predictor. Although statistically not significant, BCRFS was lower in group 3 with positive SM (PSM) than in group 2 with PSM (p = 0.101). BCRFS was significantly worse in group 3 with negative SM (NSM) than in group 1 with PSM (p = 0.038), while it was better in group 2 with PSM (p = 0.297).

However, the lack of nanomedicines able to simultaneously carry anti-cancer drugs and nucleic acids limits the application of this therapeutic strategy. To overcome this issue, we proposed to synthesize a pro-drug dendrimer by conjugating the PEGylated, positively charged generation 3-diaminobutyric polypropylenimine dendrimer to the anti-cancer drug camptothecin with a redox-sensitive disulphide linkage, and evaluate its efficacy to co-deliver the complexed DNA and camptothecin to cancer cells. This PEGylated pro-drug dendrimer was found to spontaneously self-assemble into cationic (∼3-5 mV) vesicles at pH 7.4, at a critical aggregation concentration of about 200 μg mL-1. These vesicles (dendrimersomes) became smaller (150-200 nm) with increasing dendrimer concentration and remained stable over 7 days. They were able to release about 70% of the conjugated camptothecin in presence of 50 mM glutathione (equivalent to the intracellular environment of tumor tissue). They could also condense more than 85% of the DNA at dendrimer : DNA weight ratios of 5 : 1 and higher. DNA condensation occurred instantly and was found to be stable for at least 24 h. This led to an enhanced cellular uptake of DNA (by up to 1.6-fold) and increased gene transfection (by up to 2.4-fold) in prostate cancer cells in comparison with the unmodified dendrimer. These novel dendrimersomes are therefore promising for single carrier-based combination cancer therapy.""","""['Partha Laskar', 'Sukrut Somani', 'Sara Jane Campbell', 'Margaret Mullin', 'Patricia Keating', 'Rothwelle J Tate', 'Craig Irving', 'Hing Y Leung', 'Christine Dufès']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Nanoscale""","""['Redox-sensitive, cholesterol-bearing PEGylated poly(propylene imine)-based dendrimersomes for drug and gene delivery to cancer cells.', 'Octadecyl chain-bearing PEGylated poly(propyleneimine)-based dendrimersomes: physicochemical studies, redox-responsiveness, DNA condensation, cytotoxicity and gene delivery to cancer cells.', 'PEGylation of polypropylenimine dendrimers: effects on cytotoxicity, DNA condensation, gene delivery and expression in cancer cells.', 'PEGylated PAMAM dendrimers: Enhancing efficacy and mitigating toxicity for effective anticancer drug and gene delivery.', 'The effect of dendrimers on the pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic behaviors of non-covalently or covalently attached drugs.', 'Glutathione-Responsive Tannic Acid-Assisted FRET Nanomedicine for Cancer Therapy.', 'Properties and Bioapplications of Amphiphilic Janus Dendrimers: A Review.', 'Margetuximab conjugated-PEG-PAMAM G4 nano-complex: a smart nano-device for suppression of breast cancer.', 'Disulfide based prodrugs for cancer therapy.', 'Lactoferrin- and Dendrimer-Bearing Gold Nanocages for Stimulus-Free DNA Delivery to Prostate Cancer Cells.']"""

Patients and methods:   mCRPC patients who had at least one abiraterone plasma concentration at steady-state were included in this study. Plasma abiraterone and its metabolites levels were analyzed using a validated liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry method. Using calculated Cmin values of abiraterone and its active metabolite Δ(4)-abiraterone (D4A), univariate, and multivariable Cox regression analyses were performed.  Results:   Sixty-two patients were included in this retrospective analysis, of which 42% were underexposed (mean abiraterone Cmin ≤ 8.4 ng/mL). In multivariable analysis, Cmin ≥ 8.4 ng/mL was associated with longer prostate-specific antigen (PSA) independent progression-free survival (16.9 vs 6.1 months; p = 0.033), which resulted in a hazard ratio of 0.44 (95% confidence interval: 0.23-0.82, p = 0.01). D4A Cmin did not show a relationship with treatment efficacy.  Conclusion:   Our study shows that mCRPC patients with an abiraterone Cmin ≥ 8.4 ng/mL have a better prognosis compared with patients with low Cmin.

The objective of this study was to assess the safety and feasibility of whole-prostate gland cryotherapy combined with pembrolizumab and androgen deprivation in men with oligometastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer.  Methods:   This single-institution, pilot trial recruited 12 patients with newly diagnosed oligometastatic prostate cancer between 2015 and 2016.

The primary clinical endpoints were the number of patients with a PSA level of <0.6 ng/mL at one year and the frequency of adverse events. Other outcome measures included progression-free survival and systemic therapy-free survival. Exploratory analyses included PD-L1 protein expression.  Results:   Forty two percent (5/12) of patients had a PSAs of <0.6 ng/mL at one year though only 2 of these patients had recovered their testosterone at this time point.

Mechanistically, FOXB2 induces multiple Wnt ligands, including WNT7B, which increases TCF/LEF-dependent transcription without activating Wnt coreceptor LRP6 or β-catenin. Proximity ligation and functional complementation assays identified several transcription regulators, including YY1, JUN, and DDX5, as cofactors required for FOXB2-dependent pathway activation. Although FOXB2 expression is limited in adults, it is induced in select cancers, particularly advanced prostate cancer. RNA-seq data analysis suggests that FOXB2/WNT7B expression in prostate cancer is associated with a transcriptional program that favors neuronal differentiation and decreases recurrence-free survival.

The majority of cancers overcome these critical barriers by upregulating telomerase, a telomere-specific reverse transcriptase. However, a subset of cancers maintains telomere lengths by the telomerase-independent Alternative Lengthening of Telomeres (ALT) pathway. The presence of ALT is strongly associated with recurrent cancer-specific somatic inactivating mutations in the ATRX-DAXX chromatin-remodeling complex. Here, we generate an ALT-positive adenocarcinoma cell line following functional inactivation of ATRX and telomerase in a telomerase-positive adenocarcinoma cell line. Inactivating mutations in ATRX were introduced using CRISPR-cas9 nickase into two prostate cancer cell lines, LAPC-4 (derived from a lymph node metastasis) and CWR22Rv1 (sourced from a xenograft established from a primary prostate cancer). In LAPC-4, but not CWR22Rv1, abolishing ATRX was sufficient to induce multiple ALT-associated hallmarks, including the presence of ALT-associated promyelocytic leukemia bodies (APB), extrachromosomal telomere C-circles, and dramatic telomere length heterogeneity. However, telomerase activity was still present in these ATRXKO cells. Telomerase activity was subsequently crippled in these LAPC-4 ATRXKO cells by introducing mutations in the TERC locus, the essential RNA component of telomerase. These LAPC-4 ATRXKO TERCmut cells continued to proliferate long-term and retained ALT-associated hallmarks, thereby demonstrating their reliance on the ALT mechanism for telomere maintenance.

Prior evidence has suggested an association between a transient prostate specific antigen (PSA) bounce and improved biochemical control. However, racial differences in this relationship have remained relatively unexplored.  Methods and materials:   We identified 4477 men treated for low- or intermediate-risk prostate cancer within the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) from 2000 to 2010 with brachytherapy alone or in combination with external beam radiotherapy without androgen deprivation. Longitudinal PSA data were used to define to biochemical failure and PSA bounce. Cox proportional hazard models were used explore racial differences in the relationship between the PSA bounce and time to biochemical failure.  Results:   Thirty-one percent of our sample experienced a PSA bounce, with African Americans more likely to experience a bounce (42%) compared with Caucasians (29%); p < 0.001. Despite this, African Americans had a higher likelihood of biochemical failure (hazard ratio [HR] 1.4; p = 0.006). However, African American men experiencing a PSA bounce were less likely to experience a biochemical failure (HR = 0.64; p = 0.046), whereas this relationship was not statistically significant for Caucasians (HR = 0.78; p = 0.092). On multivariate analysis, African Americans receiving brachytherapy alone were most sensitive to the protective benefit of the PSA bounce (HR = 0.64).

Nitric oxide (NO) is both a radical and versatile messenger molecule involved in many physiological activities. NO was documented to be highly secreted and utilized by cancer cells. Nω-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) is utilized for inhibiting NO synthase. Its worst long-term side effect is reported to be hypertension, hence less cytotoxic than chemotherapeutic agents. Herein, we carried out a cytotoxicity study on how different doses of L-NAME affect DU145 human prostate cancer cells. First, toxic doses of L-NAME were determined. Then, while antioxidant capacity was determined by glutathione and total antioxidant status, oxidative stress was evaluated by quantifying malondialdehyde, NO, and total oxidant status levels. Inflammatory effects of L-NAME were investigated by measuring tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels. Apoptotic effects of L-NAME were evaluated by measuring cytochrome C somatic and caspase 3 levels and by staining Bax protein. Finally, morphological analysis was performed. IC50 of L-NAME against DU145 cells was 12.2 mM. In L-NAME-treated DU145 cells, a dose-dependent increase in oxidative stress, inflammatory, and apoptotic marker proteins and decrease in antioxidant capacity were observed. While at the moderate dose of L-NAME, apoptotic changes were commonly observed, at higher doses, vacuolated and swollen cells were also recorded. We believe that the present study will encourage future studies by providing insights about dose and effects of L-NAME.""","""['S Kacar', 'F Kar', 'C Hacioglu', 'G Kanbak', 'V Sahinturk']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Hum Exp Toxicol""","""['NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester, an inhibitor of nitric oxide synthesis, ameliorates interleukin 2-induced capillary leakage and reduces tumour growth in adenocarcinoma-bearing mice.', 'Nitric oxide synthase inhibition by N(G)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester inhibits tumor-induced angiogenesis in mammary tumors.', 'Nitric oxide donors prevent while the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor L-NAME increases arachidonic acid plus CYP2E1-dependent toxicity.', 'Effects of N(G)-Nitro-L-arginine methyl ester, an inhibitor of nitric oxide synthesis, on IL-2-induced LAK cell generation in vivo and in vitro in healthy and tumor-bearing mice.', 'Concentration-Dependent Effects of Zinc Sulfate on DU-145 Human Prostate Cancer Cell Line: Oxidative, Apoptotic, Inflammatory, and Morphological Analyzes.', 'Effect of Meloxicam on the Proliferation and Apoptosis of the Raji Cell Line: an In Vitro Study.', 'Chemokines and cytokines: Axis and allies in prostate cancer pathogenesis.', 'Evaluation of Oxidative Stress Biomarkers, Pro-Inflammatory Cytokines, and Histological Changes in Experimental Hypertension, Dyslipidemia, and Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus.', 'Identification of SLITRK6 as a Novel Biomarker in hepatocellular carcinoma by comprehensive bioinformatic analysis.', ""(3,3'-Methylene)bis-2-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinones induce cytotoxicity against DU145 and PC3 cancer cells by inhibiting cell viability and promoting cell cycle arrest.""]"""

The treatment goal is to give a high enough dose to the tumour while sparing nearby healthy tissue and organs (organs-at-risk). The most common criteria for evaluating dose distributions are dosimetric indices. For the tumour, such an index is the portion of the volume that receives at least a specified dose level (e.g. the prescription dose), while for organs-at-risk it is instead the portion of the volume that receives at most a specified dose level. Dosimetric indices are aggregate criteria and do not consider spatial properties of the dose distribution. Further, there are neither any established evaluation criteria for characterizing spatial properties, nor have such properties been studied in the context of mathematical optimization of brachytherapy. Spatial properties are however of clinical relevance and therefore dose plans are sometimes adjusted manually to improve them. We propose an optimization model for reducing the prevalence of contiguous volumes with a too high dose (hot spots) or a too low dose (cold spots) in a tentative dose plan. This model is independent of the process of constructing the tentative plan. We conduct computational experiments with tentative plans obtained both from optimization models and from clinical practice. The objective function considers pairs of dose points and each pair is given a distance-based penalty if the dose is either too high or too low at both dose points. Constraints are included to retain dosimetric indices at acceptable levels. Our model is designed to automate the manual adjustment step in the planning process. In the automatic adjustment step large-scale optimization models are solved. We show reductions of the volumes of the largest hot and cold spots, and the computing times are feasible in clinical practice.""","""['Björn Morén', 'Torbjörn Larsson', 'Åsa Carlsson Tedgren']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Phys Med Biol""","""['Technical note: Evaluation of a spatial optimization model for prostate high dose-rate brachytherapy in a clinical treatment planning system.', 'IPIP: A new approach to inverse planning for HDR brachytherapy by directly optimizing dosimetric indices.', 'An extended dose-volume model in high dose-rate brachytherapy - Using mean-tail-dose to reduce tumor underdosage.', 'Optimization in treatment planning of high dose-rate brachytherapy - Review and analysis of mathematical models.', 'The increasing potential of nuclear medicine imaging for the evaluation and reduction of normal tissue toxicity from radiation treatments.', 'Analysis of radioactive implant migration in patients treated with iodine-125 seeds for permanent prostate brachytherapy with MRI-classified median lobe hyperplasia.']"""

Significant changes were observed in global histone modifications (H3K9ac, H3K9me3, H3K27me3, and H4K20me3) in PC-3 cells. According to these results, we investigated wide-range epigenetic modifications using PCR arrays. After 96 h BPA exposure, chromatin modifying enzymes including KDM5B and NSD1 were significantly downregulated. Also, promoter methylation of tumor suppressor genes including BCR, GSTP1, LOX, MGMT, NEUROG1, PDLIM4, PTGS2, PYCARD, TIMP3, TSC2 and ZMYDN10 altered significantly. ChIP results showed that H3K9ac, H3K9me3 and H3K27me3 modifications on p16 gene showed significant increases after 1 and 10 μM of BPA exposure.

RT techniques such as brachytherapy or intensity modulated RT (IMRT) allow for more conformal dose distributions, but it is not known whether the risk for pelvic fracture varies by RT modality.  Methods and materials:   This observational cohort study involved 28,354 patients ≥65 years old, treated with RT for pelvic malignancies. We evaluated the relative risk of pelvic fracture by type of RT when accounting for baseline factors. To test for nonspecific effects, we also evaluated risk of nonpelvic fractures in the same population.  Results:   The 5-year incidence of pelvic fractures was 12.7% (95% confidence interval [CI], 11.6%-13.8%), 11.8% (10.8%-12.8%), and 3.7% (3.4%-4.0%) for patients with gastrointestinal, gynecologic, and prostate cancer, respectively. On multivariable analysis, being treated with IMRT (hazard ratio, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.73-0.99) or brachytherapy therapy alone (hazard ratio, 0.43; 95% CI, 0.34-0.54) was associated with a reduced hazard for pelvic fractures compared with 3D conformal radiation therapy in female patients. In contrast, there was no association with RT modality and the hazard for nonpelvic fractures among females. There was no significant association between pelvic fractures and IMRT or brachytherapy for male patients. White race, advanced age, and higher comorbidity were associated with an increased hazard for pelvic fracture.

Methods and materials:   A prospective multicenter cohort study of eligible patients (stage ≥T2c, Gleason score ≥7 or presenting prostate-specific antigen ≥10) treated between 2009 and 2013 were enrolled in a United Kingdom national protocol delivering combined external beam radiation therapy and high-dose-rate brachytherapy. Centers elected to deliver WPRT, 46 Gy in 23 fractions or PORT 37.5 Gy in 15 fractions with 15 Gy single dose high-dose-rate brachytherapy. The primary endpoint was biochemical progression-free survival (bPFS). Secondary endpoints were overall survival, genitourinary, and gastrointestinal toxicity. This was not a randomized comparison and was subject to bias; the findings are therefore hypothesis generating, but not conclusive.  Results:   Eight hundred and twelve patients were entered; 401 received WPRT and 411 received PORT. With a median follow-up of 4.7 years, 5-year bPFS rates for WPRT versus PORT arms were 89% versus 81% (P = .007) for all patients and 84% versus 77% (P = .001) for high-risk patients. Differences in bPFS remained significant after accounting for Gleason score, presenting prostate-specific antigen, T stage, and androgen deprivation therapy duration as covariates. There was no difference in overall survival. The overall post treatment toxicities across both cohorts were low with no greater than 1.5% of ≥grade 3 toxicities at any follow-up time point. WPRT increased both prevalence and cumulative incidence of acute genitourinary toxicity (P = .004) and acute gastrointestinal toxicity (P = .003). No difference in late radiation toxicity was observed.  Conclusions:   A significant improvement in 5-year bPFS was seen in intermediate and high-risk prostate cancer treated with WPRT compared with PORT in a combined external beam radiation therapy and brachytherapy schedule with no increase in late radiation toxicity.""","""['Hannah Tharmalingam', 'Yatman Tsang', 'Ananya Choudhury', 'Roberto Alonzi', 'James Wylie', 'Imtiaz Ahmed', 'Ann Henry', 'Catherine Heath', 'Peter J Hoskin']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys""","""['Shifting the Curtain-Can We Make Sense of the Whole Pelvis Controversy?', 'High-dose-rate brachytherapy monotherapy without androgen deprivation therapy for intermediate-risk prostate cancer.', 'Sequence of hormonal therapy and radiotherapy field size in unfavourable, localised prostate cancer (NRG/RTOG 9413): long-term results of a randomised, phase 3 trial.', 'Acute genitourinary toxicity after high-dose-rate (HDR) brachytherapy combined with hypofractionated external-beam radiation therapy for localized prostate cancer: correlation between the urethral dose in HDR brachytherapy and the severity of acute genitourinary toxicity.', 'Preliminary toxicity and prostate-specific antigen response of a Phase I/II trial of neoadjuvant hormonal therapy, 103Pd brachytherapy, and three-dimensional conformal external beam irradiation in the treatment of locally advanced prostate cancer.', 'Quality of life outcomes after low dose-rate brachytherapy for localized prostate cancer: Current status and future perspectives.', 'Dose outside of the prostate is associated with improved outcomes for high-risk prostate cancer patients treated with brachytherapy boost.', 'The prognostic significance of the clinical T stage and Grade Group in patients with locally advanced prostate cancer treated via high-dose-rate brachytherapy and external beam radiation.', 'Dose differentiated high-dose-rate prostate brachytherapy: a feasibility assessment of MRI-guided dose escalation to dominant intra-prostatic lesions.', 'Early results of PRO-EPI: PROspective multicenter observational study on elective pelvic nodes irradiation in patients with intermediate/high/very high-risk non-metastatic prostate cancer submitted to radical, adjuvant, or salvage radiotherapy with or without concomitant androgen deprivation therapy.', 'Stereotactic Radiation Therapy versus Brachytherapy: Relative Strengths of Two Highly Efficient Options for the Treatment of Localized Prostate Cancer.']"""

Despite the advantages these vehicles provide over free drugs, there are still limitations with regards to the efficiency of liposomes delivery to tumors and off-target accumulation. A better understanding of nanodrugs extravasation mechanisms in different tumor types and normal vessels is needed to improve their antitumor activity. We used intravital microscopy to track for fluorescent liposomes behavior in xenograft tumor models (murine breast cancer 4T1 and melanoma B16, human prostate cancer 22Rv1) and normal skin and identified two distinct extravasation patterns. Microleakage, a local perivascular nanoparticle deposition, was found both in malignant and healthy tissues. This type of liposomes leakage does not provide access to tumor cells and is presumably responsible for drug deposition in normal tissues. In contrast, macroleakage penetrated deep into tissues and localized predominantly on the tumor-host interface. Although neutrophils did not uptake liposomes, their extravasation appeared to initiate both micro- and macroleakages. Based on neutrophils and liposomes extravasation dynamics, we hypothesized that microleakage and macroleakage are subsequent steps of the extravasation process corresponding to liposomes transport through endothelial and subendothelial barriers. Of note, extravasation spots were detected more often in the proximity of neutrophils, and across studied tumor types, neutrophils counts correlated with leakage frequencies. Reduced liposomes accumulation in 4T1 tumors upon Ly6G depletion further corroborated neutrophils role in nanoparticles delivery. Elucidating liposomes extravasation routes has a potential to help improve existing strategies and develop effective nanodrugs for cancer therapy.""","""['Victor A Naumenko', 'Kseniya Yu Vlasova', 'Anastasiia S Garanina', 'Pavel A Melnikov', 'Daria M Potashnikova', 'Daniil A Vishnevskiy', 'Stepan S Vodopyanov', 'Vladimir P Chekhonin', 'Maxim A Abakumov', 'Alexander G Majouga']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""ACS Nano""","""['Neutrophil-mediated transport is crucial for delivery of short-circulating magnetic nanoparticles to tumors.', 'Improved intratumoral nanoparticle extravasation and penetration by mild hyperthermia.', 'Revealing Dynamics of Accumulation of Systemically Injected Liposomes in the Skin by Intravital Microscopy.', 'Elucidation for Intratumor Localization of a DDS-based Anticancer Drug and Enhancement of Its Therapeutic Effects via Improvement of the Tumor Microenvironment.', 'Construction of arsenic-metal complexes loaded nanodrugs for solid tumor therapy: A mini review.', 'Exploring the Process of Neutrophil Transendothelial Migration Using Scanning Ion-Conductance Microscopy.', 'Spatial analysis of nanoparticle distribution in human breast xenografts reveals nanoparticles targeted to cancer cells localized with tumor-associated stromal cells.', 'Supermagnetic Human Serum Albumin (HSA) Nanoparticles and PLGA-Based Doxorubicin Nanoformulation: A Duet for Selective Nanotherapy.', 'A microfluidic model of human vascularized breast cancer metastasis to bone for the study of neutrophil-cancer cell interactions.', 'Profiling target engagement and cellular uptake of cRGD-decorated clinical-stage core-crosslinked polymeric micelles.']"""

Methods:   Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was utilized to detect SNHG4 expression in tissue samples and PCa cells. Cell counting kit-8, 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine, clonogenic formation, wound-healing, and transwell invasion assays were, respectively, used to evaluate cell proliferation, colony formation ability, migration, and invasion. Flow cytometric analysis was applied to assess cell apoptosis. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays were conducted to determine the binding between SP1 and SNHG4 promoter. Luciferase reporter assay, qRT-PCR, and western blot analysis were carried out to explore and confirm the interaction among SNHG4, miR-377, and ZIC5.  Results:   SNHG4 was highly expressed in PCa and its upregulation was induced by transcription factor SP1. The high levels of SNHG4 were distinctly associated with tumor stage, lymph node metastasis, and reduced overall survival of patients with PCa. SNHG4 knockdown inhibited the growth, migration, and invasion of PCa cells. In addition, miR-377 was a target of SNHG4 and ZIC5 was a target gene of miR-377 in PCa. SNHG4 promoted ZIC5-mediated growth and metastasis through modulating miR-377.

Their biological significance is backed up by a plethora of emerging evidence. One of the most robust approaches to demonstrate non-coding RNA's biological relevance is through their prognostic value. Using the rich gene expression data from The Cancer Genome Altas (TCGA), we designed Advanced Expression Survival Analysis (AESA), a web tool which provides several novel survival analysis approaches not offered by previous tools. In addition to the common single-gene approach, AESA computes the gene expression composite score of a set of genes for survival analysis and utilizes permutation test or cross-validation to assess the significance of log-rank statistic and the degree of over-fitting. AESA offers survival feature selection with post-selection inference and utilizes expanded TCGA clinical data including overall, disease-specific, disease-free, and progression-free survival information. Users can analyse either protein-coding or non-coding regions of the transcriptome. We demonstrated the effectiveness of AESA using several empirical examples. Our analyses showed that non-coding RNAs perform as well as messenger RNAs in predicting survival of cancer patients. These results reinforce the potential prognostic value of non-coding RNAs. AESA is developed as a module in the freely accessible analysis suite MutEx.

Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) is another IFNγ inducible gene that has potent immunosuppressive effects. There have been reports of IDO expression in prostate cancer; however, it is unknown whether IDO expression might similarly increase in prostate tumors following T-cell-based immunotherapy.  Methods:   Blood samples from normal male blood donors (n = 12) and patients with different stages of prostate cancer (n = 89), including patients with metastatic, castration-resistant prostate cancer treated with a DNA vaccine and/or pembrolizumab, were evaluated for IDO activity by kynurenine and tryptophan levels. Metastatic tissue biopsies obtained pre- and post-treatments were evaluated for IDO expression. IDO suppression of vaccine-induced T-cell function was assessed by ELISPOT.  Results:   Overall, IDO activity was increased in patients with more advanced prostate cancer. This activity, and IDO expression as detected immunohistochemically, increased following treatment with either a DNA vaccine encoding the prostatic acid phosphatase (PAP) tumor antigen or PD-1 blockade with pembrolizumab. Increased IDO activity after treatment was associated with the absence of clinical effect, as assessed by lack of PSA decline following treatment. Increased antigen-specific T-cell response, as measured by IFNγ release, to the vaccine target antigen was detected following in vitro stimulation of peripheral blood cells with 1-methyltryptophan.  Conclusions:   These findings suggest that IDO expression is a mechanism of immune evasion used by prostate cancer and that future clinical trials using T-cell-based immune strategies might best include IDO inhibition.""","""['Chris D Zahm', 'Laura E Johnson', 'Douglas G McNeel']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Cancer Immunol Immunother""","""['Indoleamine 2,3-Dioxygenase-1 Expression in Adrenocortical Carcinoma.', 'Variable indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase expression in acral/mucosal melanoma and its possible link to immunotherapy.', 'Prognosis significance of indoleamine 2, 3-dioxygenase, programmed death ligand-1 and tumor-infiltrating immune cells in microenvironment of breast cancer.', 'Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) inhibitors and cancer immunotherapy.', 'Immune modulations during chemoimmunotherapy & novel vaccine strategies--in metastatic melanoma and non small-cell lung cancer.', 'Indoleamine-2,3 dioxygenase: a fate-changer of the tumor microenvironment.', 'Induction of PARP7 Creates a Vulnerability for Growth Inhibition by RBN2397 in Prostate Cancer Cells.', 'Vaccines as treatments for prostate cancer.', 'The Tobacco β-Cembrenediol: A Prostate Cancer Recurrence Suppressor Lead and Prospective Scaffold via Modulation of Indoleamine 2,3-Dioxygenase and Tryptophan Dioxygenase.', 'Glyoxalase-1-Dependent Methylglyoxal Depletion Sustains PD-L1 Expression in Metastatic Prostate Cancer Cells: A Novel Mechanism in Cancer Immunosurveillance Escape and a Potential Novel Target to Overcome PD-L1 Blockade Resistance.']"""

Design, setting, and participants:   A nationwide cohort study was conducted, including 154 811 men in Prostate Cancer data Base Sweden (PCBaSe) 4.0 diagnosed with nonmetastatic prostate cancer during 1998-2016 and followed through 2016.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   We compared the D'Amico, National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), European Association of Urology (EAU), Genito-Urinary Radiation Oncologists of Canada (GUROC), American Urological Association (AUA), National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN), and Cambridge Prognostic Groups (CPG) risk group systems; the Cancer of the Prostate Risk Assessment (CAPRA) score; and the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) nomogram in predicting prostate cancer death by estimating the concordance index (C-index) and the observed versus predicted cumulative incidences at different follow-up times.  Results and limitations:   A total of 139 515 men were included in the main analysis, of whom 15 961 died from prostate cancer during follow-up. The C-index at 10 yr of follow-up ranged from 0.73 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.72-0.73) to 0.81 (95% CI: 0.80-0.81) across the compared tools. The MSKCC nomogram (C-index: 0.81, 95% CI: 0.80-0.81), CAPRA score (C-index: 0.80, 95% CI: 0.79-0.81), and CPG system (C-index: 0.78, 95% CI: 0.78-0.79) performed the best. The order of performance between the tools remained in analyses stratified by primary treatment and year of diagnosis. The predicted cumulative incidences were close to the observed ones, with some underestimation at 5 yr. It is a limitation that the study was conducted solely in a Swedish setting (ie, case mix).  Conclusions:   The MSKCC nomogram, CAPRA score, and CPG risk grouping system performed better in discriminating prostate cancer death than the D'Amico and D'Amico-derived systems (NICE, GUROC, EAU, AUA, and NCCN). Use of these tools may improve clinical decision making.  Patient summary:   There are numerous pretreatment risk classification tools that can aid treatment decision for prostate cancer. We systematically compared the prognostic performance of the most commonly used tools in a large cohort of Swedish men with prostate cancer. The Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center nomogram, Cancer of the Prostate Risk Assessment score, and Cambridge Prognostic Groups performed best in predicting prostate cancer death.

Results:   PTPN12 staining was typically absent or weak in normal prostatic epithelium but seen in the majority of cancers, where staining was considered weak in 26.5%, moderate in 39.9%, and strong in 4.7%. High PTPN12 staining was associated with high pT category, high classical and quantitative Gleason grade, lymph node metastasis, positive surgical margin, high Ki67 labeling index and early prostate specific antigen recurrence (p < 0.0001 each). PTPN12 staining was seen in 86.4% of TMPRSS2:ERG fusion positive but in only 58.4% of ERG negative cancers. Subset analyses discovered that all associations with unfavorable phenotype and prognosis were markedly stronger in ERG positive than in ERG negative cancers but still retained in the latter group. Multivariate analyses revealed an independent prognostic impact of high PTPN12 expression in all cancers and in the ERG negative subgroup and to a lesser extent also in ERG positive cancers. Comparison with 12 previously analyzed chromosomal deletions revealed that high PTPN12 expression was significantly associated with 10 of 12 deletions in ERG negative and with 7 of 12 deletions in ERG positive cancers (p < 0.05 each) indicating that PTPN12 overexpression parallels increased genomic instability in prostate cancer.

Recently an MR-only workflow has been proposed that employs standard MR sequences and visualizes conventional implanted seed with positive contrast solely through MR postprocessing. In this work, the novel MR-only based workflow is compared with the clinical CT-MRI fusion approach.  Methods and materials:   Twenty-four prostate patients with a total of 1775 implanted LDR seeds were scanned using a 3-dimensional multiecho gradient echo sequence on a 3 Tesla MR scanner within 30 days after implantation. Quantitative susceptibility mapping was used for seed visualization. Seeds were automatically segmented and localized on the quantitative susceptibility mapping using convolutional neural network and k-means clustering, respectively. To assess the MR-only seed localization error, CT and MR-derived seed positions were coregistered, and ultimately, the resulting dose-volume histograms were compared.  Results:   The MR-based seed visualization, segmentation, and localization generated comparable results to the CT-MR registration approach. The accuracy of the MRI-only based seed identification was 99.1%. After a rigid registration between the MR and CT-derived seed centroids, the average localization error was 0.8 ± 0.8 mm. The average prostate D90, V100, V150, and V200 for MRI-only and CT-MR fusion based dosimetry were 114.3 ± 12.5% versus 113.9 ± 11.9%, 95.1 ± 3.7% versus 95.3 ± 3.8%, 54.5 ± 14.5% versus 55.0 ± 13.2% and 22.9 ± 6.8% versus 23.2 ± 6.7%, respectively. No significant differences were observed in 3-dimensional seed positions and dosimetric parameters between MR-only and CT-MR fusion-based workflows (P > 0.2).  Conclusions:   The MRI-only LDR postimplant dosimetry is feasible and has very good potential to eliminate the need for CT-based seed identification.""","""['Reyhaneh Nosrati', 'Matthew Wronski', 'Chia-Lin Tseng', 'Hans Chung', 'Ana Pejović-Milić', 'Gerard Morton', 'Greg J Stanisz']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys""","""['Feasibility of an MRI-only workflow for postimplant dosimetry of low-dose-rate prostate brachytherapy: Transition from phantoms to patients.', 'MRI-based automated detection of implanted low dose rate (LDR) brachytherapy seeds using quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) and unsupervised machine learning (ML).', 'Deformable registration of x ray and MRI for postimplant dosimetry in low dose rate prostate brachytherapy.', 'The American Brachytherapy Society recommendations for permanent prostate brachytherapy postimplant dosimetric analysis.', 'Which patients benefit from post-implant CT dosimetry after real-time intraoperative planning for low dose rate prostate brachytherapy?

Comprehensive profiles identified 11keto-testosterone as the predominant active androgen in the metabolism of the C11-oxy C19 steroids, and we identified, for the first time, 11β-hydroxy-5α-androstane-3α,17β-diol, a novel steroid in the 11OHA4-pathway. Analysis of the inactivation and reactivation of the metabolites showed that DHT is more readily inactivated than 11keto-dihydrotestosterone (11KDHT). The conversion of 11β-hydroxyprogesterone (11βOHPROG) yielded 11keto-progesterone (11KPROG), while the latter yielded 11keto-dihydroprogesterone (11KDHPROG). BPH tissue analysis identified high levels of 11β-hydroxyandrosterone (4-14 ng/g) and 11keto-androsterone (9-160 ng/g), together with androstenedione (A4; ∼7.5 ng/g). The major C11-oxy C21 steroids detected were 11βOHPROG (∼46 ng/g), 11KPROG (∼130 ng/g) as well as 11KDHPROG (∼282 ng/g). While circulatory 11βOHPROG was detected below the limit of quantification, 11KPROG and 11KDHPROG were detected at 6 and 8.5 nmol/L, respectively. Glucuronide derivatives of both 11KPROG and pregnanetriol were also detected. 11OHA4 was the major free androgen in circulation at 85.9 nmol/L, ±12-fold higher than A4, together with 5α-androstane-3α,17β-diol quantified at 69.3 nmol/L. Circulatory C11-oxy C19 steroids levels were also significantly higher (8-fold) than the C11-oxy C21 steroid levels, while the former were similar to the C19 steroid levels, in contrast to levels in PCa. The study highlights the contribution of adrenal C11-oxy steroids to the androgen pool in BPH underscoring their limited reactivation and elimination, and significant inter-individual variations regarding steroid levels and conjugation. Targeted steroid metabolome analysis is critical to understanding prostate steroidogenesis and disease progression, and analysis of circulatory C11-oxy C19 and C11-oxy C21 steroids, together with intraprostatic levels, add to our current understanding of BPH.""","""['Therina du Toit', 'Amanda C Swart']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""J Steroid Biochem Mol Biol""","""['Profiling adrenal 11β-hydroxyandrostenedione metabolites in prostate cancer cells, tissue and plasma: UPC2-MS/MS quantification of 11β-hydroxytestosterone, 11keto-testosterone and 11keto-dihydrotestosterone.', 'CYP17A1 exhibits 17αhydroxylase/17,20-lyase activity towards 11β-hydroxyprogesterone and 11-ketoprogesterone metabolites in the C11-oxy backdoor pathway.', 'Inefficient UGT-conjugation of adrenal 11β-hydroxyandrostenedione metabolites highlights C11-oxy C19 steroids as the predominant androgens in prostate cancer.', 'Back where it belongs: 11β-hydroxyandrostenedione compels the re-assessment of C11-oxy androgens in steroidogenesis.', 'Pathways and genes involved in steroid hormone metabolism in male pigs: a review and update.', 'Circulating adrenal 11-oxygenated androgens are associated with clinical outcome in endometrial cancer.', 'Gut feelings about bacterial steroid-17,20-desmolase.', 'Determination of Intraprostatic and Intratesticular Androgens.', 'Characterization of human adrenal cytochrome P450 11B2 products of progesterone and androstenedione oxidation.', '11-Keto-testosterone and other androgens of adrenal origin.']"""

Methods:   Guided by Cognitive-Social Health Information Processing (C-SHIP) model and informed by core self-management skills, we engaged in a user-centered design process. In phase I, we conducted in-depth interviews with survivors of breast (n = 33), prostate (n = 4), and colorectal (n = 6) cancers, and (n = 9) primary care providers to develop content and design of the web tool. Phase II utilized iterative user testing interviews (n = 9) to test the web-based tool prototype. Data from both phases were independently coded using a template/content analytic approach.  Results:   The top 5 functions identified in phase I for the web-based platform included: (a) educational materials to learn and prepare for health encounters (80%); (b) questions for health providers (74%); (c) ability to track contact information of providers (67%); (d) provide general information (64%); and, (e) support information (62%). Users of the prototype reported patient burden, tool fatigue, introduction timing of the tool, relevance, and security/privacy as concerns in phase II.

Twice-refocused bipolar encoding suppresses eddy current artifacts, but increases echo time (TE), leading to lower signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Optimization of the diffusion encoding might improve prostate DWI.  Purpose:   To evaluate eddy current nulled convex optimized diffusion encoding (ENCODE) for prostate DWI with minimal TE.  Study type:   Prospective cohort study.  Population:   A diffusion phantom, an ex vivo prostate specimen, 10 healthy male subjects (27 ± 3 years old), and five prostate cancer patients (62 ± 7 years old).  Field strength/sequence:   3T; single-shot spin-echo echoplanar DWI.  Assessment:   Eddy-current artifacts, TE, SNR, apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), and image quality scores from three independent readers were compared between monopolar, bipolar, and ENCODE prostate DWI for standard-resolution (1.6 × 1.6 mm2 , partial Fourier factor [pF] = 6/8) and higher-resolution protocols (1.6 × 1.6 mm2 , pF = off; 1.0 × 1.0 mm2 , pF = 6/8).  Statistical testing:   SNR and ADC differences between techniques were tested with Kruskal-Wallis and Wilcoxon signed-rank tests (P < 0.05 considered significant).  Results:   Eddy current suppression with ENCODE was comparable to bipolar encoding (mean coefficient of variation across three diffusion directions of 9.4% and 9%). For a standard-resolution protocol, ENCODE achieved similar TE as monopolar and reduced TE by 14 msec compared to bipolar, resulting in 27% and 29% higher mean SNR in prostate transition zone (TZ) and peripheral zone (PZ) (P < 0.05) compared to bipolar, respectively. For higher-resolution protocols, ENCODE achieved the shortest TE (67 msec), with 17-21% and 58-70% higher mean SNR compared to monopolar (TE = 77 msec) and bipolar (TE = 102 msec) in PZ and TZ (P < 0.05). No significant differences were found in mean TZ (P = 0.91) and PZ ADC (P = 0.94) between the three techniques. ENCODE achieved similar or higher image quality scores than bipolar DWI in patients, with mean intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.77 for overall quality between three independent readers.  Data conclusion:   ENCODE minimizes TE (improves SNR) and reduces eddy-current distortion for prostate DWI compared to monopolar and bipolar encoding.

However, in prostate cancer (PC) the link has been less studied. We evaluated differences in prostate cancer-specific mortality (PCSM) between current smokers, past smokers, and never smokers diagnosed with PC.  Methods:   This was a retrospective cohort study of PCSM in men diagnosed with PC between 2000 and 2015 treated in the US Veterans Affairs health care system, using competing risk regression analyses.  Results:   The cohort included 73,668 men (current smokers: 22,608 (30.7%), past smokers: 23,695 (32.1%), and never smokers: 27,365 (37.1%)). Median follow-up was 5.9 years. Current smoker patients were younger at presentation (median age current: 63, never: 66; p < 0.001), and had more advanced disease stage (stage IV disease current: 5.3%, never: 4.3%; p < 0.04). The 10-year incidence of PCSM was 5.2%, 4.8%, and 4.5% for current, past, and never smokers, respectively. On competing risk regression, current smoking was associated with increased PCSM (subdistribution hazard ratio: 1.14, 95% confidence interval: (1.05-1.24), p = 0.002), whereas past smoking was not. Hierarchical regression suggests that this increased risk was partially attributable to tumor characteristics.  Conclusions:   Smoking at the time of diagnosis is associated with a higher risk of dying from PC as well as other causes of death. In contrast, past smoking was not associated with PCSM suggesting that smoking may be a modifiable risk factor. PC diagnosis may be an important opportunity to discuss smoking cessation.""","""['Paul Riviere', 'Abhishek Kumar', 'Elaine Luterstein', 'Lucas K Vitzthum', 'Vinit Nalawade', 'Reith R Sarkar', 'Alex K Bryant', 'John P Einck', 'Arno J Mundt', 'James D Murphy', 'Brent S Rose']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Prostate Cancer Prostatic Dis""","""['The effect of smoking on prostate cancer survival: a cohort analysis in Barcelona.', 'Smoking and prostate cancer survival and recurrence.', 'Smoking cessation and mortality trends among two United States populations.', 'Tobacco smoking and survival after a prostate cancer diagnosis: A systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Smoking and Pancreatic Cancer: Smoking Patterns, Tobacco Type, and Dose-Response Relationship.', 'Relationship between cigarette use and prostate cancer risk: what do we know and what should we do?', 'Post-diagnostic health behaviour scores in relation to fatal prostate cancer.', 'Inflammation and Prostate Cancer: A Multidisciplinary Approach to Identifying Opportunities for Treatment and Prevention.', 'A decreased risk of meningioma in women smokers was only observed in American studies rather than studies conducted in other countries: a systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Post-Diagnostic Dietary and Lifestyle Factors and Prostate Cancer Recurrence, Progression, and Mortality.']"""

We showed that, in one patient with pancreatic cancer, the expression of a truncated form of SPOP (p.Q360*) lacking the nuclear localization signal led to nuclear accumulation of NANOG, which promoted growth and metastasis of pancreatic cancer cells.

This association remains controversial, and little is known about the effects of ADT in younger men.  Objective:   To examine the association between the receipt of ADT and these outcomes in young men aged 40-64 yr presenting with nonmetastatic prostate cancer (PCa).  Design, setting, and participants:   For this observational study, we identified 9117 men aged 40-64 yr diagnosed with localized PCa between 2007 and 2014, without a pre-existing neurocognitive diagnosis, using the TRICARE military database.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Kaplan-Meier curves were fitted to compare ADT versus no ADT. We also performed a subgroup analysis in patients undergoing ADT for ≥12 mo. The association between ADT and new-onset dementia or depression was evaluated using inverse-probability-of treatment-weight-adjusted Cox proportional hazards regression analysis.  Results and limitations:   Patients receiving ADT had a significantly higher incidence of depression (30.2 vs 15.8 per 1000 person years) and dementia (17.9 vs 7.5 per 1000 person years). The risk of developing either outcome was higher in the ADT cohort (depression: hazard ratio [HR] 2.07, p < 0.001; dementia: HR 1.70, p = 0.052). Additionally, there was a dose-response relationship between the duration of ADT and either outcome.  Conclusions:   In our cohort of young men with PCa, the receipt of ADT was associated with an increased risk of developing dementia and depression. Long-term use of ADT was associated with the highest risk of neurocognitive outcomes.  Patient summary:   In this study, we looked at the risk of dementia and depression in patients <65 yr of age undergoing androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) for prostate cancer.

Patients and methods:   We retrospectively assessed 186 patients who received docetaxel chemotherapy in addition to androgen deprivation for CRPC between 2005 and 2015. We stratified the patients according to their pre-chemotherapy serum sodium level. Hyponatremia was defined as sodium < 135 mmol/L. A Cox proportional regression model was used to estimate overall survival (OS).  Results:   The median sodium level was 139 mmol/L (interquartile range, 137-141 mmol/L). Hyponatremia was detected in 13 (6.9%) patients. One-half of the patients died during the studied period.

Although existing investigations have revealed the oncogenic role of lncRNA SOX2 overlapping transcript (SOX2-OT) in different kinds of cancers, such as osteosarcoma and cholangiocarcinoma, the potential role of it in prostate cancer (PC) is poorly understood. This study was the first attempt to decipher the underlying regulatory mechanism of SOX2-OT in PC. According to the data from this study, SOX2-OT expression was conspicuously elevated in PC tissues and cells. Silenced SOX2-OT could repress PC cell proliferation and migration. Besides, mechanism assays manifested that SOX2-OT bound with miR-369-3p and negatively correlated with miR-369-3p in PC. Additionally, miR-369-3p was confirmed to elicit suppressive impact on PC progression. What's more, cofilin 2 (CFL2) was testified to be a downstream target gene of miR-369-3p. Final rescue tests uncovered that CFL2 upregulation or miR-369-3p inhibition could largely restore SOX2-OT knockdown-mediated function on PC progression.

Whilst previous studies have demonstrated significant pathological upgrading and downgrading following radical prostatectomy (RP), these were based on historical cohorts and do not reflect contemporary patient selection and management practices. The aim of this national, multicentre observational study was to characterise contemporary rates and risk factors for pathological upgrading after RP in the United Kingdom (UK).  Methods:   All RP entries on the British Association of Urological Surgeons (BAUS) Radical Prostatectomy Registry database of prospectively entered cases undertaken between January 2011 and December 2016 were extracted. Those patients with full preoperative PSA, clinical stage, needle biopsy and subsequent RP pathological grade information were included. Upgrade was defined as any increase in Gleason grade from initial needle biopsy to pathological assessment of the entire surgical specimen. Statistical analysis and multivariate logistic regression were undertaken using R version 3.5 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria).  Results:   A total of 17,598 patients met full inclusion criteria. Absolute concordance between initial biopsy and pathological grade was 58.9% (n = 10,364), whilst upgrade and downgrade rates were 25.5% (n = 4489) and 15.6% (n = 2745) respectively. Upgrade rate was highest in those with D'Amico low risk compared with intermediate and high-risk disease (55.7% versus 19.1 and 24.3% respectively, P < 0.001). Although rates varied between year of surgery and geographical regions, these differences were not significant after adjusting for other preoperative diagnostic variables using multivariate logistic regression.  Conclusions:   Pathological upgrading after RP in the UK is lower than expected when compared with other large contemporary series, despite operating on a generally higher risk patient cohort. As new diagnostic techniques that may reduce rates of pathological upgrading become more widely utilised, this study provides an important benchmark against which to measure future performance.""","""['Nicholas Bullock', 'Andrew Simpkin', 'Sarah Fowler', 'Murali Varma', 'Howard Kynaston', 'Krishna Narahari']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""BMC Urol""","""['UK radical prostatectomy outcomes and surgeon case volume: based on an analysis of the British Association of Urological Surgeons Complex Operations Database.', 'The ability of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) density to predict an upgrade in Gleason score between initial prostate biopsy and prostatectomy diminishes with increasing tumour grade due to reduced PSA secretion per unit tumour volume.', 'Prostate-specific antigen vs prostate-specific antigen density as a predictor of upgrading in men diagnosed with Gleason 6 prostate cancer by contemporary multicore prostate biopsy.', 'Upgrading and downgrading of prostate cancer from biopsy to radical prostatectomy: incidence and predictive factors using the modified Gleason grading system and factoring in tertiary grades.', 'Why the UK Should Consider Gene Expression Testing in Prostate Cancer.', 'Adverse Pathology after Radical Prostatectomy of Patients Eligible for Active Surveillance-A Summary 7 Years after Introducing mpMRI-Guided Biopsy in a Real-World Setting.', 'Pathological Accuracy in Prostate Cancer: Single-Center Outcomes of 3 Different Magnetic Resonance Imaging-Targeted Biopsy Techniques and Random Systematic Biopsy.', 'The impact of surgical downgrading on prostate cancer recurrence: systematic review and analysis of a multiethnic population.', 'Endogenous testosterone density as ratio of endogenous testosterone levels on prostate volume predicts tumor upgrading in low-risk prostate cancer.', 'Combined Systematic and MRI-US Fusion Prostate Biopsy Has the Highest Grading Accuracy When Compared to Final Pathology.']"""

Method:   This retrospective, single center cohort study includes 193 consecutive patients with PI-RADS assessment category 4 in mp-MRI (T2WI, DWI, DCE) at 3 T with targeted plus systematic biopsy combined as the reference standard. The detection of prostate cancer with and without the use of DCE was compared.  Results:   Overall, the PCa detection rate in PI-RADS-4 patients was 62 % (119/193) with DCE and 52 % (101/193) without the inclusion of lesions upgraded on the basis of DCE. 48 % (92/193) had clinically significant PCa (csPCa; Gleason score ≥ 3 + 4 = 7) and 40 % (78/193) without use of DCE. 38 of the 193 patients (20 %) had peripheral lesions upgraded from PI-RADS category 3 to an overall PI-RADS category 4 due to focal positive DCE findings. Of these 38 patients, 18 had PCa including 14 with csPCa. Thus, 15 % (18/119) of the patients with PCa and 15 % (14/92) of the patients with csPCa were detected only based on additional DCE information.  Conclusion:   DCE prevents underestimation and misclassification of a significant number of cases of peripheral csPCa and might improve detection rates in PI-RADS-4 patients. The current PI-RADS decision rules regarding upgrading PI-RADS-3 lesions to category 4 due to positive DCE imaging are useful for PCa detection.

Because steroids must enter cells before activating nuclear receptors, understanding the mechanisms by which cellular uptake occurs is critical, yet a clear understanding of these mechanisms has been elusive. It is generally assumed that diffusion-driven uptake is similar across various steroids whereas an elevated cellular concentration is thought to reflect active uptake, but these assumptions have not been directly tested. Here we show that intact cells rapidly accumulate free steroids to markedly elevated concentrations. This effect varies widely depending on steroid structure; more lipophilic steroids reach more elevated concentrations. Strong preferences exist for 3β-OH, Δ5-steroids vs. 3-keto, Δ4-structural features and for progestogens vs. androgens. Surprisingly, steroid-structure-specific preferences do not require cell viability, implying a passive mechanism, and occur across cells derived from multiple tissue types. Physiologic relevance is suggested by structure-specific preferences in human prostate tissue compared with serum. On the other hand, the presence of serum proteins in vitro blocks much, but not all, of the passive accumulation, while still permitting a substantial amount of active accumulation for certain steroids. Our findings suggest that both passive and active uptake mechanisms make important contributions to the cellular steroid uptake process. The role of passive, lipophilicity-driven accumulation has previously been largely unappreciated, and its existence provides important context to studies on steroid transport and action both in vitro and in vivo.""","""['Jeffrey M McManus', 'Kelsey Bohn', 'Mohammad Alyamani', 'Yoon-Mi Chung', 'Eric A Klein', 'Nima Sharifi']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Steroidogenesis in Peripheral and Transition Zones of Human Prostate Cancer Tissue.', 'Simultaneous determination of 15 steroids in rat blood via gas chromatography-mass spectrometry to evaluate the impact of emasculation on adrenal.', 'Neurosteroidogenesis in rat retinas.', 'Androgen glucuronides analysis by liquid chromatography tandem-mass spectrometry: could it raise new perspectives in the diagnostic field of hormone-dependent malignancies?', 'Drug control of steroid metabolism by the hepatic endoplasmic reticulum.', 'Adrenal Steroids and Resistance to Hormonal Blockade of Prostate and Breast Cancer.', 'Toward Realistic Dosimetry In Vitro: Determining Effective Concentrations of Test Substances in Cell Culture and Their Prediction by an In Silico Mass Balance Model.', 'Association Between Adrenal-Restrictive HSD3B1 Inheritance and Hormone-Independent Subtypes of Endometrial and Breast Cancer.', 'Inheritance of a common androgen synthesis variant allele is associated with female COVID susceptibility in UK Biobank.', 'Intratumoral steroid profiling of adrenal cortisol-producing adenomas by liquid chromatography- mass spectrometry.']"""

About 70% of bladder tumors are non-muscle-invasive, and the rest are muscle-invasive. Recurrence of the tumor is the common feature of bladder cancer. Chemotherapy is a conventional treatment for MIBC, but it cannot improve the survival rate of these patients sufficiently. Therefore, researchers must develop new therapies. Antibody-based therapy is one of the most important strategies for the treatment of solid tumors. Selecting a suitable target is the most critical step for this strategy.  Objective:   The aim of this study is to detect therapeutic cell surface antigen targets in bladder cancer using data obtained by proteomic studies.  Methods:   Isobaric tag for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ) analysis had identified 131 overexpressed proteins in baldder cancer tissue and reverse-phase proteomic array (RPPA) analysis had been done for 343 tumor tissues and 208 antibodies. All identified proteins from two studies (131+208 proteins) were collected and duplicates were removed (331 unique proteins). Gene ontology study was performed using gene ontology (GO) and protein analysis through evolutionary relationships (PANTHER) databases. The Human Protein Atlas database was used to search the protein class and subcellular location of membrane proteins obtained from the PANTHER analysis.  Results:   Membrane proteins that could be suitable therapeutic targets for bladder cancer were selected. These included: Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), Her2, Kinase insert domain receptor (KDR), Heat shock protein 60 (HSP60), HSP90, Transferrin receptor (TFRC), Activin A Receptor Like Type 1 (ACVRL1), and cadherin 2 (CDH2).

Macrocyclic chelating agent 1,8-diamino-3,6,10,13,16,19-hexaazabicyclo[6.6.6]-eicosine (DiAmSar) was conjugated with PEG unit and followed by coupling with VCN. The precursor was then radiolabeled with positron emitter 64Cu (t1/2 = 12.7 h) in ammonium acetate buffer to provide 64Cu-Sar-PEG-VCN, which was subsequently subjected to in vitro studies, small animal PET, and biodistribution studies. The PC-3 tumor-targeting efficacy of 64Cu-Sar-PEG-VCN was compared to a cyclic RGD peptide-based PET probe (64Cu-Sar-RGD). 64Cu labeling was achieved in 75% decay-corrected yield with radiochemical purity of > 98%. The specific activity of 64Cu-Sar-PEG-VCN was estimated to be 37 MBq/nmol. MicroPET imaging results showed that 64Cu-Sar-PEG-VCN has preferential tumor uptake and good tumor retention in PC-3 tumor xenografts. As compared to 64Cu-Sar-RGD, 64Cu-Sar-PEG-VCN produces higher tumor-to-muscle (T/M) imaging contrast ratios at 2 h (4.66 ± 0.34 vs. 2.88 ± 0.46) and 24 h (4.98 ± 0.80 vs. 3.22 ± 0.30) post-injection (pi) and similar tumor-to-liver ratios at 2 h (0.43 ± 0.09 vs. 0.37 ± 0.04) and 24 h (0.57 ± 0.13 vs. 0.52 ± 0.07) pi. The biodistribution results were consistent with the quantitative analysis of microPET imaging, demonstrating good T/M ratio (2.73 ± 0.36) of 64Cu-Sar-PEG-VCN at 48 h pi in PC-3 tumor xenografts. For both microPET and biodistribution studies at 48 h pi, the PC-3 tumor uptake of 64Cu-Sar-PEG-VCN is lower than that of 64Cu-Sar-RGD. 64Cu-Sar-PEG-VCN has the potential for in vivo imaging of prostate cancer with PET, which may provide a unique non-invasive method to quantitatively localize and characterize prostate cancer.""","""['Hossein Jadvar', 'Kai Chen', 'Ryan Park', 'Li-Peng Yap', 'Ivetta Vorobyova', 'Steve Swenson', 'Francis S Markland']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Amino Acids""","""['Pegylated Arg-Gly-Asp peptide: 64Cu labeling and PET imaging of brain tumor alphavbeta3-integrin expression.', 'Novel 64Cu Labeled RGD2-BBN Heterotrimers for PET Imaging of Prostate Cancer.', 'Evaluation of a novel GRPR antagonist for prostate cancer PET imaging: 64Cu-DOTHA2-PEG-RM26.', 'Preclinical studies of a novel snake venom-derived recombinant disintegrin with antitumor activity: A review.', '64Cu-Labeled 4-((8-amino-3,6,10,13,16,19-hexaazabicyclo 6.6.6 icosane-1-ylamino)methyl)benzoic acid (AmBaSar).']"""

This study is to examine whether testosterone change rate is related to serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) concentration among PCa-free men. Longitudinal data were derived from electronic medical records at a tertiary hospital in the Southeastern USA. PCa-free men with initial-PSA < 4 ng/mL and ≥ 2 testosterone measurements were included (n = 632). Three PSA measures (peak, the most recent, and average PSA) during the study period (from first testosterone measurement to the most recent hospital visit) were examined using multivariable-adjusted geometric means and were compared across quintiles of testosterone change rate (ng/dL/month) and current testosterone level (cross-sectional). Mean (standard deviation, SD) age at baseline was 59.3 (10.5) years; mean study period was 93.0 (55.3) months. After adjusting for covariates including baseline testosterone, the three PSA measures all significantly increased across quintile of testosterone change rate from increase to decline (peak PSA: quint 1 = 1.09, quint 5 = 1.41; the most recent PSA: quint 1 = 0.85, quint 5 = 1.00; average PSA: quint 1 = 0.89, quint 5 = 1.02; all Ptrend < 0.001). But current testosterone level was not associated with PSA levels. Stratified analyses indicated men with higher adiposity (body mass index > 24.1 kg/m2) or lower baseline testosterone (≤ 296 ng/dL) were more sensitive to testosterone change in regard to PSA. Among PCa-free men, accelerated testosterone decline might correlate with higher serum PSA concentration.

Methods:   Treatment recommendations from 14 Swiss radiation oncology centers were collected and converted into decision trees. An iterative process using the objective consensus methodology was applied to assess differences and consensus.  Results:   PSMA PET/CT was recommended by 93% of the centers as restaging modality. For unfit patients defined by age, comorbidities or low performance status, androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) alone was recommended by more than 70%. For fit patients with unfavorable tumor characteristics such as short prostate-specific antigen (PSA) doubling time or initial high-risk disease, the majority of the centers (57-71%) recommended ENRT + ADT for 1-4 lesions. For fit patients with favorable tumor characteristics, there were low levels of consensus and a wide variety of recommendations. For 1-4 nodal lesions, focal SBRT was offered by 64% of the centers, most commonly as a 5-fraction course.

Although most abnormal cells are efficiently identified and destroyed by the immune system, particularly by NK cells, the molecular mechanisms by which newly born cancer cells evade NK cell surveillance are not fully understood.  Methods:   NK cell resistance of highly tumorigenic population of human prostate cancer (PCa) cells were confirmed by xenograft in SCID mice with or without NK cell neutralization. The mechanisms by which the tumorigenic PCa cells evaded NK cell attack were investigated by RNAseq, ChIPseq, generation of several transformants and xenograft in SCID mice.  Results:   Here, we show that PCa cells have a strengthened ability to escape NK cell attack due to NANOG, a pluripotent-related transcription factor, mediating the repression of ICAM1, a cell adhesion molecule, during tumorigenesis. Mechanistically, NANOG directly binds to the region upstream of ICAM1. As the binding between NANOG and the upstream ICAM1 region increases, p300 binding to this region is diminished, resulting in decreased ICAM1 expression. High NANOG expression confers PCa cells the ability to resist NK cell attack via the repression of ICAM1. Consistent with these results, low ICAM1 expression is significantly correlated with a high recurrence rate in patients with PCa.  Conclusions:   Our findings indicate that repression of ICAM1 is a critical mechanism by which cancer cells evade attack from NK cells during tumorigenesis. These results suggest a pivotal role of NANOG in establishing a gene expression profile for escaping the immune system.""","""['Kotaro Saga', 'Jinhee Park', 'Keisuke Nimura', 'Norihiko Kawamura', 'Airi Ishibashi', 'Norio Nonomura', 'Yasufumi Kaneda']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""J Exp Clin Cancer Res""","""['HIF-1α induces immune escape of prostate cancer by regulating NCR1/NKp46 signaling through miR-224.', 'Attenuation of the glucocorticoid response during Ad5IL-12 adenovirus vector treatment enhances natural killer cell-mediated killing of MHC class I-negative LNCaP prostate tumors.', 'Tumour-derived Interleukin 35 promotes pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma cell extravasation and metastasis by inducing ICAM1 expression.', 'Natural killer group 2D receptor and its ligands in cancer immune escape.', 'Natural killer cell-mediated immunosurveillance of human cancer.', 'DNA hypermethylation driven by DNMT1 and DNMT3A favors tumor immune escape contributing to the aggressiveness of adrenocortical carcinoma.', 'New insights and options into the mechanisms and effects of combined targeted therapy and immunotherapy in prostate cancer.', 'Epigenetic modulation and prostate cancer: Paving the way for NK cell anti-tumor immunity.', 'The Developmental Origins of Cancer: A Review of the Genes Expressed in Embryonic Cells with Implications for Tumorigenesis.', 'Novel Roles of Nanog in Cancer Cells and Their Extracellular Vesicles.']"""

Specifically, in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) patients, fatigue is the most common adverse event associated with current treatments. The purpose of this study is to describe the prevalence of fatigue and its impact on quality of life (QoL) in patients with CRPC in routine clinical practice.  Methods:   This was a cross-sectional, multicentre study. Male chemo-naïve adults with high-risk non-metastatic (M0) CRPC and metastatic (M1) CRPC (mCRPC) were eligible. Fatigue was measured using the Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI) and QoL was assessed using the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy questionnaire for patients with prostate cancer (FACT-P) and the FACT-General (FACT-G) questionnaire. Data were analysed using Mann-Whitney or Kruskal-Wallis tests (non-parametric distribution), a T-test or an ANOVA (parametric distribution) and the Fisher or chi-squared tests (categorical variables).  Results:   A total of 235 eligible patients were included in the study (74 [31.5%] with M0; and 161 [68.5%] with M1). Fatigue was present in 74%, with 38.5% of patients reporting moderate-to-severe fatigue. Mean FACT-G and FACT-P overall scores were 77.6 ± 16.3 and 108.7 ± 21.4, respectively, with no differences between the CRPC M0 and CRPC M1 subgroups. Fatigue intensity was associated with decreased FACT-G/P scores, with no differences between groups. Among 151 mCRPC patients with available treatment data, those treated with abiraterone-prednisone ≥3 months showed a significant reduction in fatigue intensity (p = 0.043) and interference (p = 0.04) compared to those on traditional hormone therapy (HT). Patients on abiraterone-prednisone ≥3 months showed significantly better FACT-G/P scores than patients on HT (p = 0.046 and 0.018, respectively).  Conclusion:   Our data show a high prevalence and intensity of fatigue and its impact on QoL in chemo-naïve CRPC patients. There is an association between greater fatigue and less QoL, irrespective of the presence or absence of metastasis. Chemo-naïve mCRPC patients receiving more than 3 months of abiraterone acetate plus prednisone showed an improvement of fatigue and QoL when compared to those on traditional HT.

We also evaluated the impact of percent pattern 4 and cribriform glands at biopsy in the risk of GS 3+4=7 upgrading.  Methods:   A total of 301 patients with GS 3+4 PCa on biopsy (159 SBx and 142 TBx) who underwent laparoscopic robot-assisted RP were sequentially enrolled. Histological data from RP sections were used as reference standard. The concordance of biopsy with pathological GS, as well as the GS 3+4 upgrading at RP were evaluated in different univariate and multivariate binary logistic regression models, testing age, PSA, fPSA%, tumor volume, PI-RADS, clinical stage, percentage of Gleason pattern 4 (GP) and/or presence of cribriform sub-type at biopsy.  Results:   Of the 301 biopsies, the median of GP 4 was 16% of the tissue. Minimal GP 4 (≤16%) cancers had a significant lower median volume (1.7 mL) than those with GP4 >16% (2.9 mL), (P<0.001). Pathological GS 3+4 was confirmed for 58.8% and 82.2% for SBx and TBx patients, respectively. The rate of upgraded and downgraded GS on SBx versus TBx was 38.8% vis. 16.7% and 1.8% and 2.1%, respectively.

Here, by analyzing genotyping data from two published genome-wide association studies (GWASs), we evaluated associations between genetic variants in the endosome-related gene-set and survival of patients with nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The discovery included 44,112 (3,478 genotyped and 40,634 imputed) single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 220 genes in a singlelocus analysis for their associations with survival of 1,185 NSCLC patients from the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer Screening Trial. After validation of the 821 survival-associated significant SNPs in additional 984 NSCLC patients from the Harvard Lung Cancer Susceptibility Study, 14 SNPs remained significant. The final multivariate stepwise Cox proportional hazards regression modeling of the PLCO dataset identified three potentially functional and independent SNPs (i.e., KIF16B rs1555195 C>T, NEDD4L rs11660748 A>G and rs73440898 A>G) with an adjusted hazards ratio (HR) of 0.86 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.79-0.94, p = 0.0007), 1.31 (1.16-1.47, p = 6.0 × 10-5 ) and 1.27 (1.12-1.44, p = 0.0001) for overall survival (OS), respectively. Combined analysis of the adverse genotypes of these three SNPs revealed a trend in the genotype-survival association (ptrend < 0.0001 for OS and ptrend < 0.0001 for disease-specific survival). Furthermore, the survival-associated KIF16B rs1555195T allele was significantly associated with decreased mRNA expression levels of KIF16B in both lung tissues and blood cells.

Therefore, new treatment options are required. Vitamin C (VC) has been identified as a promising anti-cancer agent of which the effects depend on the accumulation of H2O2 that is produced through autoxidation. Sulfasalazine (SAS), a cystine transporter (Xc-) inhibitor, is known to suppress cellular glutathione (GSH) biosynthesis. Here, we hypothesized that targeting the Xc- transporter via SAS may improve the anti-cancer activity of VC through regulating GSH biosynthesis, which in turn may result in the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS).  Methods:   The anti-cancer effect of VC and/or SAS on prostate cancer cells was assessed using WST-8, colony formation and annexin V-FITC/PI FACS assays. Changes in cellular ROS and GSH levels were determined to verify our hypothesis. Finally, BALB/c nude mice bearing prostate cancer xenografts were used to assess the anti-cancer effects of single or combined VC and SAS therapies.  Results:   We found that SAS could potentiate the short- and long-term cytotoxicity of VC in prostate cancer cells. We also found that the synergistic effect of SAS and VC led to significant cellular GSH depletion, resulting in increased ROS accumulation. This synergistic effect could be reversed by the antioxidant N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC). The synergistic effect of SAS and VC was also noted in prostate cancer xenografts and correlated with immunohistochemistry results.  Conclusions:   Our results strongly indicate that SAS, a relatively non-toxic drug that targets cystine transporters, in combination with VC may be superior to their single applications in the treatment of prostate cancer.""","""['Zijie Zheng', 'Ganhua Luo', 'Xinchong Shi', 'Yali Long', 'Wanqing Shen', 'Zhoulei Li', 'Xiangsong Zhang']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Cell Oncol (Dordr)""","""['Xc- inhibitor sulfasalazine sensitizes colorectal cancer to cisplatin by a GSH-dependent mechanism.', 'Drug repurposing: sulfasalazine sensitizes gliomas to gamma knife radiosurgery by blocking cystine uptake through system Xc-, leading to glutathione depletion.', 'Combination Therapy with Sulfasalazine and Valproic Acid Promotes Human Glioblastoma Cell Death Through Imbalance of the Intracellular Oxidative Response.', 'N-Acetyl Cysteine and Glutathione in Health and Cancer-Pharmacogenomics, Research, and Clinical Practice: Hypothesis and Review.', 'The effects of high concentrations of vitamin C on cancer cells.', 'Dietary Manipulation of Amino Acids for Cancer Therapy.', 'Mitochondrial respiration inhibitor enhances the anti-tumor effect of high-dose ascorbic acid in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'The Role of SLC7A11 in Cancer: Friend or Foe?', 'Oral Conventional Synthetic Disease-Modifying Antirheumatic Drugs with Antineoplastic Potential: a Review.', 'High-dose intravenous vitamin C, a promising multi-targeting agent in the treatment of cancer.']"""

However, little is known about periprostatic fat (PPF) and its relationship with overall fat deposition in PCa. PPF is thought to contribute to PCa growth and migration via secreted factors and induction of chronic inflammation. We investigated if pre-treatment PPF thickness correlates with overall survival (OS).  Methods:   We reviewed 85 hormone-naïve men with advanced PCa who had received androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). PPF thickness was measured by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and compared with subcutaneous fat (SCF) thickness as an internal control. Visceral fat (VF) area measured by computed tomography served as an additional control. We evaluated the relationship between laboratory data, pathology results, and obesity parameters and OS.  Results:   Median follow-up was 50.6 months. Thirty-six patients died during follow-up. Univariate analysis revealed that nadir PSA titer, Gleason score, N stage, M stage, extent of disease by bone scan grade, hemoglobin, lactate dehydrogenase, alkaline phosphatase, and PPF/SCF ratio were associated with OS. Multivariate analysis revealed that nadir PSA titer, N stage, and PPF/SCF ratio were independent prognostic factors for survival. The 5-year OS in the patients with higher PPF/SCF ratio (≥ 1) and lower PPF/SCF ratio (< 1) was 49.5% and 66.5%, respectively (P = 0.039).

Applying the inclusion (histological diagnosis of thyroid cancer and tissue availability) and exclusion criteria (no clinical or follow-up data or diagnosis of medullary thyroid cancer), a cohort of 59 patients was selected. The monoclonal mouse anti-human PSMA antibody was used to stain tissue sections. A 3-point scale was used to score PSMA positivity: 0-5% expression was considered as negative (score 0), 6-50% as moderately positive (score 1), and 51-100% as highly positive (score 2). A cumulative score (0-10%, 11-79%, and 80-100%) was also explored. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to predict the presence of distant metastases, chosen as endpoint of aggressiveness. The area under the curve (AUC) was calculated. Cox models were built to predict patient outcome in terms of recurrence, iodine refractoriness, and status at last follow-up, which were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier failure function.  Results:   At immunostaining, 12, 25, and 22 patients had scores of 0, 1, and 2, respectively. According to the cumulative score, PSMA expression was ≤ 10% in 17 cases, 11-79% in 31 cases, and ≥ 80% in 11 cases. At multivariate analysis, age, sex, histotype, vascular invasion, T and N parameters, and PSMA positivity were significant predictors of distant metastases. The AUC was 0.92. Recurrence or progression occurred in 19/59 patients. Twelve patients developed radioiodine (RAI) refractoriness, after a median time of 17 months (range 2-32).

In this study, we demonstrated the role of novel exonuclease 5 (EXO5) gene in androgen-induced double strand breaks repair via homology-directed repair pathway and prostate tumorigenesis. Using whole-exome sequencing of samples from 20 PCa families, with three or more siblings diagnosed with metastatic PCa, we identified mutations in 31 genes involved in DSB response and repair. Among them, the L151P mutation in the exonuclease 5 (EXO5) gene was present in all affected siblings in three PCa families. We found two other EXO5 SNPs significantly associated with risk of PCa in cases-controls study from databases of genotype and phenotype (dbGaP), which are in linkage disequilibrium (D' = 1) with Exo5 L151P found in PCa family. The L151 residue is conserved across diverse species and its mutation is deleterious for protein functions, as demonstrated by our bioinformatics analyses. The L151P mutation impairs the DNA repair function of EXO5 due to loss of nuclease activity, as well as failure of nuclear localization. CRISPR elimination of EXO5 in a PCa cell line impaired homology-directed recombination repair (HDR) and caused androgen-induced genomic instability, as indicated by frequent occurrence of the oncogenic fusion transcript TMPRSS2-ERG. Genetic and functional validation of the EXO5 mutations indicated that EXO5 is a risk gene for prostate tumorigenesis, likely due to its functions in HDR.""","""['Shafat Ali', 'Yilan Zhang', 'Mian Zhou', 'Hongzhi Li', 'Weiwei Jin', 'Li Zheng', 'Xiaochun Yu', 'Jeremy M Stark', 'Jeffrey N Weitzel', 'Binghui Shen']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Oncogene""","""['EXO5-DNA structure and BLM interactions direct DNA resection critical for ATR-dependent replication restart.', 'Predisposition for TMPRSS2-ERG fusion in prostate cancer by variants in DNA repair genes.', 'CHD1 loss sensitizes prostate cancer to DNA damaging therapy by promoting error-prone double-strand break repair.', 'The prognostic and predictive value of TMPRSS2-ERG gene fusion and ERG protein expression in prostate cancer biopsies.', 'Recurrent rearrangements in prostate cancer: causes and therapeutic potential.', 'DNA damage repair-related gene signature predicts prognosis and indicates immune cell infiltration landscape in skin cutaneous melanoma.', 'Alterations in Molecular Profiles Affecting Glioblastoma Resistance to Radiochemotherapy: Where Does the Good Go?', 'Decoding Cancer Variants of Unknown Significance for Helicase-Nuclease-RPA Complexes Orchestrating DNA Repair During Transcription and Replication.', 'EXO5-DNA structure and BLM interactions direct DNA resection critical for ATR-dependent replication restart.', 'Comprehensive Genomic Characterization of Fifteen Early-Onset Lynch-Like Syndrome Colorectal Cancers.']"""

Radical prostatectomy, i.e., the surgical removal of the entire prostate, is a frequently used option. Biochemical recurrence (BCR), i.e., detectable prostate specific antigen (PSA), is common in some men following such treatment. The timing of BCR to metastatic spread of disease in bones is usually a few years. If the biochemical failure occurs after a longer duration from the time of curative intent, it is generally believed to lead to local recurrence. CASE REPORT We report on two cases. A 78-year-old male was diagnosed with Gleason 7, prostate cancer in 2001. He subsequently underwent an open radical prostatectomy. Serial post-operative PSA's were undetectable (<0.01 ng/mL) up to 2016. He was diagnosed with a detectable PSA for the first time with a value of 0.3 ng/mL, that year. The PSA continued to rise to a level of 1.1 ng/mL. This rise in the PSA was within a 12-month interval. Subsequent bone scan and bone biopsy detected prostate cancer metastasis in multiple bones. Our second case was a 65-year-old male who underwent a laparoscopic radical prostatectomy in the year 2006 for a biopsy proven prostate cancer with Gleason 3+4=7. Serial post-operative PSA's were undetectable up to 2017. Within a span of 8 months, the PSA rose from 0.3 ng/mL to 1.52 ng/mL. A positron emission tomography scan demonstrated pubic bone lesion indicative of prostate cancer metastasis. CONCLUSIONS BCR can occur a decade after curative intent treatment of prostate cancer. The duration from BCR to detectable metastasis can be shorter. We demonstrated here that the site of recurrence, in such scenarios, can be distant metastasis and not local recurrence alone. Better imaging modalities are needed to identify the spread of prostate cancer at low levels of PSA.""","""['Ayman Mahdy', 'Rohan Patil', 'Shobha Parajuli']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Am J Case Rep""","""['Assessing the Optimal Timing for Early Salvage Radiation Therapy in Patients with Prostate-specific Antigen Rise After Radical Prostatectomy.', 'Is there a role for ¹¹C-choline PET/CT in the early detection of metastatic disease in surgically treated prostate cancer patients with a mild PSA increase <1.5 ng/ml?', 'More advantages in detecting bone and soft tissue metastases from prostate cancer using 18F-PSMA PET/CT.', 'Markers and meaning of primary treatment failure.', 'Single skull metastasis 15 years after primary treatment of prostate cancer and with undetectable PSA levels: a case report and review of the literature.', 'Incidental finding of metastatic prostatic adenocarcinoma of frontotemporal bone presenting as subdual hematoma: A case report and review of literature.', 'Prognostic value of miR-21 for prostate cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis.']"""

This study aimed to understand how rurality and racial segregation are independently and interactively associated with cancer screening and cancer fatalism.  Methods:   We used data from a nationally representative sample of adults (n=17 736) from National Cancer Institute's Health Information National Trends Survey, 2011-2017, including cancer screening (colorectal, breast, cervical, prostate) among eligible participants and cancer fatalism. These data were linked to county-level metropolitan status/rurality (US Department of Agriculture) and racial segregation (US Census). We conducted multivariable analyses of associations of geographic variables with screening and fatalism.  Results:   Breast cancer screening was lower in rural (92%, SE=1.5%) than urban counties (96%, SE=0.5%) (adjusted OR (aOR)=0.52, 95% CI 0.31 to 0.87). Colorectal cancer screening was higher in highly segregated (70%, SE=1.0%) than less segregated counties (65%, SE=1.7%) (aOR=1.28, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.58). Remaining outcomes did not vary by rurality or segregation, and these variables did not interact in their associations with screening or fatalism.  Conclusion:   Similar to previous studies, breast cancer screening was less common in rural areas. Contrary to expectations, colorectal cancer screening was higher in highly segregated counties. More research is needed on the influence of geography on cancer screening and beliefs, and how access to facilities or information may mediate these relationships.""","""['Jennifer L Moss', 'Rebecca Ehrenkranz', 'Lilian G Perez', 'Brionna Y Hair', 'Anne K Julian']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""J Epidemiol Community Health""","""['Invasive Cancer Incidence, 2004-2013, and Deaths, 2006-2015, in Nonmetropolitan and Metropolitan Counties - United States.', 'Association of Neighborhood Measures of Social Determinants of Health With Breast, Cervical, and Colorectal Cancer Screening Rates in the US Midwest.', 'Disparities in Cancer Screening: The Role of County-Level Metropolitan Status and Racial Residential Segregation.', 'Effect of rurality on screening for breast cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis comparing mammography.', 'Exploring the influence of rural residence on uptake of organized cancer screening - A systematic review of international literature.', 'Perspectives on Self-Sampling for Cancer Screening From Staff at Federally Qualified Health Centers in Rural and Segregated Counties: A Preliminary Qualitative Study.', 'Assessing the use of constructs from the consolidated framework for implementation research in U.S. rural cancer screening promotion programs: a systematic search and scoping review.', 'Impact of COVID-19 on cancer screening in South Korea.', 'Examining multilevel neighborhood socioeconomic characteristics associated with colorectal cancer screening in Vietnamese Americans residing in Philadelphia County.', 'Rural-Urban Differences in Breast Cancer Stage at Diagnosis.']"""

We investigate differences in reported urinary, bowel, sexual and hormone-related problems between symptomatic and PSA-detected prostate cancer survivors.  Methods:   A UK wide cross-sectional postal survey of prostate cancer survivors conducted 18-42 months post-diagnosis. Questions were included on presentation method and treatment. Functional outcome was determined using the EPIC-26 questionnaire. Reported outcomes were compared for symptomatic and PSA-detected survivors using ANOVA and multivariable log-linear regression.  Results:   Thirty-five thousand eight hundred twenty-three men responded (response rate: 60.8%). Of these, 31.3% reported presenting via PSA test and 59.7% symptomatically. In multivariable analysis, symptomatic men reported more difficulty with urinary incontinence (Adjusted mean ratio (AMR): 0.96, 95% CI: 0.96-0.97), urinary irritation (AMR: 0.95, 95% CI: 0.95-0.96), bowel function (AMR: 0.97, 95% CI: 0.97-0.98), sexual function (AMR: 0.90, 95% CI: 0.88-0.92), and vitality/hormonal function (AMR: 0.96, 95% CI: 0.96-0.96) than PSA-detected men. Differences were consistent across respondents of differing age, stage, Gleason score and treatment type.  Conclusion:   Prostate cancer survivors presenting symptomatically report poorer functional outcomes than PSA-detected survivors. Differences were not explained by socio-demographic or clinical factors.

This report outlines a comprehensive data science strategy for building such tools with application to the Prostate Biopsy Collaborative Group prostate cancer risk prediction tool.  Methods:   We created models for high-grade prostate cancer risk using six established risk factors. The data comprised 8492 prostate biopsies collected from ten institutions, 2 in Europe and 8 across North America. We calculated area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) for discrimination, the Hosmer-Lemeshow test statistic (HLS) for calibration and the clinical net benefit at risk threshold 15%. We implemented several internal cross-validation schemes to assess the influence of modeling method and individual cohort on validation performance.  Results:   High-grade disease prevalence ranged from 18% in Zurich (1863 biopsies) to 39% in UT Health San Antonio (899 biopsies). Visualization revealed outliers in terms of risk factors, including San Juan VA (51% abnormal digital rectal exam), Durham VA (63% African American), and Zurich (2.8% family history). Exclusion of any cohort did not significantly affect the AUC or HLS, nor did the choice of prediction model (pooled, random-effects, meta-analysis). Excluding the lowest-prevalence Zurich cohort from training sets did not statistically significantly change the validation metrics for any of the individual cohorts, except for Sunnybrook, where the effect on the AUC was minimal. Therefore the final multivariable logistic model was built by pooling the data from all cohorts using logistic regression. Higher prostate-specific antigen and age, abnormal digital rectal exam, African ancestry and a family history of prostate cancer increased risk of high-grade prostate cancer, while a history of a prior negative prostate biopsy decreased risk (all p-values < 0.004).

Especially, the metabolic imbalance of androgen in elderly men is one of the leading causes of BPH. Dihydrotestosterone (DHT) and converted testosterone by 5-α reductase type 2 (5AR2), binding with androgen receptor (AR), affect prostate proliferation and growth. In BPH, levels of androgen signaling-related protein expression are shown highly. Androgen signaling induces the overexpression of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and cell proliferation factor such as proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and cyclin D1. Grape skin anthocyanins are well known for their antioxidative, anti-cancer, anti-diabetes, anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, and anti-aging activities. Polymerized anthocyanin (PA) downregulated the expression of androgen signaling-related proteins such as 5AR2, AR, and PSA in LNCaP cell lines. Furthermore, we investigated the effects on PA in testosterone propionate-induced BPH rat experiments. The oral administration of PA decreased the prostate weight in rats with TP-induced BPH. PA decreased the AR, 5AR2, SRC1, PSA, PCNA, and cyclin D1 expression in prostate tissues and the serum DHT levels, ameliorated the BPH-mediated increase of Bcl-2 expression, and increased the Bax expression. These results suggest that PA may be a potential natural therapeutic agent for BPH treatment.""","""['Young-Jin Choi', 'Meiqi Fan', 'Yujiao Tang', 'Hyun Pil Yang', 'Ji-Young Hwang', 'Eun-Kyung Kim']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Nutrients""","""['Psoralea corylifolia L. extract ameliorates benign prostatic hyperplasia by regulating prostate cell proliferation and apoptosis.', 'Quisqualis indica Improves Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia by Regulating Prostate Cell Proliferation and Apoptosis.', 'Effect of Paecilomyces tenuipes Extract on Testosterone-Induced Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia in Sprague-Dawley Rats.', 'Dihydrotestosterone and the concept of 5alpha-reductase inhibition in human benign prostatic hyperplasia.', 'Dihydrotestosterone and the concept of 5alpha-reductase inhibition in human benign prostatic hyperplasia.', 'Behind the Scenes of Anthocyanins-From the Health Benefits to Potential Applications in Food, Pharmaceutical and Cosmetic Fields.', 'An R3-MYB repressor, BnCPC forms a feedback regulation with MBW complex to modulate anthocyanin biosynthesis in Brassica napus.', 'The Promising Therapeutic and Preventive Properties of Anthocyanidins/Anthocyanins on Prostate Cancer.', 'Heat-Killed Enterococcus faecalis EF-2001 Attenuate Lipid Accumulation in Diet-Induced Obese (DIO) Mice by Activating AMPK Signaling in Liver.', 'Co-Adjuvant Therapy Efficacy of Catechin and Procyanidin B2 with Docetaxel on Hormone-Related Cancers In Vitro.']"""

Our results indicate that half of the patient-derived samples showed high GnRH-R expression, which was associated with worse prognosis, making this receptor a promising target for GnRH-based drug delivery. Photodynamic therapy is a clinically approved treatment for HNSCC, and the efficacy and selectivity may be enhanced by the covalent conjugation of the photosensitizer to a GnRH-R targeting peptide. Several native ligands, gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) isoforms, are known to target GnRH-R effectively. Therefore, different 4Lys(Bu) modified GnRH analogs were designed and conjugated to protoporphyrin IX. The receptor binding potency of the novel conjugates was measured on human pituitary and human prostate cancer cells, indicating only slightly lower GnRH-R affinity than the peptides.

However, prostate ultrasound segmentation is facing two challenges. The first is the low signal-to-noise ratio and inhomogeneity of the ultrasound image. The second is the non-standardized shape and size of the prostate.  Methods:   For prostate ultrasound image segmentation, this paper proposed an accurate and efficient method of Active shape model (ASM) with Rayleigh mixture model Clustering (ASM-RMMC). Firstly, Rayleigh mixture model (RMM) is adopted for clustering the image regions which present similar speckle distributions. These content-based clustered images are then used to initialize and guide the deformation of an ASM model.  Results:   The performance of the proposed method is assessed on 30 prostate ultrasound images using four metrics as Mean Average Distance (MAD), Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC), False Positive Error (FPE) and False Negative Error (FNE). The proposed ASM-RMMC reaches high segmentation accuracy with 95% ± 0.81% for DSC, 1.86 ± 0.02 pixels for MAD, 2.10% ± 0.36% for FPE and 2.78% ± 0.71% for FNE, respectively.

Methods:   We compared the performance of three PRS methods for prostate cancer risk assessment in a clinical trial cohort, including genetic risk score (GRS), pruning and thresholding (P + T), and linkage disequilibrium prediction (LDpred). Performance was evaluated for score deciles (broad-sense validity) and score values (narrow-sense validity).  Results:   A training process was required to identify the best P + T model (397 SNPs) and LDpred model (3 011 362 SNPs). In contrast, GRS was directly calculated based on 110 established risk-associated SNPs. For broad-sense validity in the testing population, higher deciles were significantly associated with higher observed risk; Ptrend was 7.40 × 10-11 , 7.64 × 10-13 , and 7.51 × 10-10 for GRS, P + T, and LDpred, respectively. For narrow-sense validity, the calibration slope (1 is best) was 1.03, 0.77, and 0.87, and mean bias score (0 is best) was 0.09, 0.21, and 0.10 for GRS, P + T, and LDpred, respectively.

The selective radioprotection of non-malignant cells is mediated in part by enhanced autophagy and protection of anabolic metabolism pathways, but differential H2AX activation kinetics suggested that the DNA damage response is also CD47-dependent. A high throughput screen of drug sensitivities indicated that CD47 expression selectively sensitizes Jurkat T cells to inhibitors of topoisomerases, which are known targets of Schlafen-11 (SLFN11). CD47 mRNA expression positively correlated with schlafen-11 mRNA expression in a subset of human cancers but not the corresponding non-malignant tissues. CD47 mRNA expression was also negatively correlated with SLFN11 promoter methylation in some cancers. CD47 knockdown, gene disruption, or treatment with a CD47 function-blocking antibody decreased SLFN11 expression in Jurkat cells. The CD47 signaling ligand thrombospondin-1 also suppressed schlafen-11 expression in wild type but not CD47-deficient T cells. Re-expressing SLFN11 restored radiosensitivity to a CD47-deficient Jurkat cells. Disruption of CD47 in PC3 prostate cancer cells similarly decreased schlafen-11 expression and was associated with a CD47-dependent decrease in acetylation and increased methylation of histone H3 in the SLFN11 promoter region. The ability of histone deacetylase or topoisomerase inhibitors to induce SLFN11 expression in PC3 cells was lost when CD47 was targeted in these cells. Disrupting CD47 in PC3 cells increased resistance to etoposide but, in contrast to Jurkat cells, not to ionizing radiation. These data identify CD47 as a context-dependent regulator of SLFN11 expression and suggest an approach to improve radiotherapy and chemotherapy responses by combining with CD47-targeted therapeutics.""","""['Sukhbir Kaur', 'Anthony L Schwartz', 'David G Jordan', 'David R Soto-Pantoja', 'Bethany Kuo', 'Abdel G Elkahloun', 'Lesley Mathews Griner', 'Craig J Thomas', 'Marc Ferrer', 'Anish Thomas', 'Sai-Wen Tang', 'Vinodh N Rajapakse', 'Yves Pommier', 'David D Roberts']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Front Oncol""","""['Overcoming Resistance to DNA-Targeted Agents by Epigenetic Activation of Schlafen 11 (SLFN11) Expression with Class I Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors.', 'Schlafen 11 (SLFN11), a restriction factor for replicative stress induced by DNA-targeting anti-cancer therapies.', 'CD47 Receptor Globally Regulates Metabolic Pathways That Control Resistance to Ionizing Radiation.', 'Putative DNA/RNA helicase Schlafen-11 (SLFN11) sensitizes cancer cells to DNA-damaging agents.', 'A wake-up call for cancer DNA damage: the role of Schlafen 11 (SLFN11) across multiple cancers.', 'The DNA damage response pathway regulates the expression of the immune checkpoint CD47.', 'CD47-Dependent Regulation of Immune Checkpoint Gene Expression and MYCN mRNA Splicing in Murine CD8 and Jurkat T Cells.', 'Epigenetic upregulation of Schlafen11 renders \u2028WNT- and SHH-activated medulloblastomas sensitive to\xa0cisplatin.', 'Mechanistic understanding of human SLFN11.', 'Single vesicle analysis of CD47 association with integrins and tetraspanins on extracellular vesicles released by T lymphoblast and prostate carcinoma cells.']"""

Men with a low-risk prostate cancer (PCa) should consider observation, particularly active surveillance (AS), a monitoring strategy that avoids active treatment (AT) in the absence of disease progression. Objective. To determine clinical and decision-making factors predicting treatment selection. Design. Prospective cohort study. Setting. Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC). Patients. Men newly diagnosed with low-risk PCa between 2012 and 2014 who remained enrolled in KPNC for 12 months following diagnosis. Measurements. We used surveys and medical record abstractions to measure sociodemographic and clinical characteristics and psychological and decision-making factors. Men were classified as being on observation if they did not undergo AT within 12 months of diagnosis. We performed multivariable logistic regression analyses. Results. The average age of the 1171 subjects was 61.5 years (s = 7.2 years), and 81% were white. Overall, 639 (57%) were managed with observation; in adjusted analyses, significant predictors of observation included awareness of low-risk status (odds ratio 1.75; 95% confidence interval 1.04-2.94), knowing that observation was an option (3.62; 1.62-8.09), having concerns about treatment-related quality of life (1.21, 1.09-1.34), reporting a urologist recommendation for observation (8.20; 4.68-14.4), and having a lower clinical stage (T1c v. T2a, 2.11; 1.16-3.84). Conversely, valuing cancer control (1.54; 1.37-1.72) and greater decisional certainty (1.66; 1.18-2.35) were predictive of AT. Limitations. Results may be less generalizable to other types of health care systems and to more diverse populations. Conclusions. Many participants selected observation, and this was associated with tumor characteristics. However, nonclinical decisional factors also independently predicted treatment selection. Efforts to provide early decision support, particularly targeting knowledge deficits, and reassurance to men with low-risk cancers may facilitate better decision making and increase uptake of observation, particularly AS.""","""['Richard M Hoffman', 'Tania Lobo', 'Stephen K Van Den Eeden', 'Kimberly M Davis', 'George Luta', 'Amethyst D Leimpeter', 'David Aaronson', 'David F Penson', 'Kathryn Taylor']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Med Decis Making""","""['Perception of cancer and inconsistency in medical information are associated with decisional conflict: a pilot study of men with prostate cancer who undergo active surveillance.', 'Treatment Preferences for Active Surveillance versus Active Treatment among Men with Low-Risk Prostate Cancer.', 'Sociodemographic and Clinical Predictors of Switching to Active Treatment among a Large, Ethnically Diverse Cohort of Men with Low Risk Prostate Cancer on Observational Management.', 'The experience of adults who choose watchful waiting or active surveillance as an approach to medical treatment: a qualitative systematic review.', 'Living with untreated prostate cancer: predictors of quality of life.', 'The 17-Gene Genomic Prostate Score Assay Is Prognostic for Biochemical Failure in Men With Localized Prostate Cancer After Radiation Therapy at a Community Cancer Center.', 'Psychological predictors of delayed active treatment following active surveillance for low-risk prostate cancer: The Patient REported outcomes for Prostate cARE prospective cohort study.', ""Factors that influence clinicians' decisions to decrease active surveillance monitoring frequency or transition to watchful waiting for localised prostate cancer: a qualitative study."", 'Comparing the clinical impact of pancreatic cyst surveillance programs: A trial of the ECOG-ACRIN cancer research group (EA2185).']"""

Methods:   22RV1 cells were cultured in vitro and divided into blank control (no drug), DOC, and HCQ (20 μmol/L)+DOC groups. The concentration of DOC was set at 10 -6 mol/L, 10 -7 mol/L, and 10 -8 mol/L in the tests. Cell proliferation activities were detected by CCK-8 method 72 h after drug treatments.

We hypothesized that the combination of extracorporeal photopheresis (ECP) and IM could have synergistic effects to treat SR steroid-refractory cGVHD. While IM and ECP are separately used for the treatment of refractory cGVHD, the combination of both has never been investigated. We describe here the efficacy of the concurrent administration of IM with ECP in seven patients with refractory sclerotic-type cGVHD who had showed insufficient response to either IM or ECP. Seven consecutive patients (3 males and 4 females) with a median age of 46 years old, who received imatinib with concurrent ECP for refractory sclerotic-type cGVHD, were included. Patients were considered refractory if they were steroid-refractory or steroid-dependent. Four patients had previously showed insufficient partial response (PR) to IM, while three patients showed insufficient PR while receiving ECP. IM was started at 200 mg/day and increased to 400 mg/day if well-tolerated. ECP was initiated twice weekly then less frequently according to the patient's individual treatment response. With a median follow-up of 56 months, the concurrent administration of IM with ECP deepened responses in all patients and induced durable complete responses (CR) in 4 (57%). Median time to best response was 4 months. Median duration of combination treatment was 42 months (range: 4-60). As of February 2018, 5 patients were still alive.

It is not established whether prevalence of germline variants varies based on ethnicity or race.  Methods:   We retrospectively examined germline genetic and clinical data of men reporting a diagnosis of prostate cancer referred to Color Genomics by a healthcare provider for testing of 30 genes associated with hereditary cancer risk. Variants were classified as pathogenic (P), likely pathogenic (LP), variant of uncertain significance (VUS), likely benign, or benign. P/LP and VUS prevalence was compared among subgroups classified by age at diagnosis, self-reported ethnicity, family history, and history of other cancer.  Results:   We identified 1,351 men reporting a diagnosis of prostate cancer of any stage who underwent germline testing. Overall, 78% of men were Caucasian, 11% Ashkenazi Jewish, 3% African-American/Canadian (AAC), 2% Hispanic, 2% Asian/Pacific Islander (API), and 4% Other (multiple, unknown, Native-American). One-hundred eighty-seven men (13.8%) carried a P/LP variant, and the most prevalent P/LP variants were in BRCA2 (3.4%), CHEK2 (2.8%), MUTYH (1.8%), and ATM (1.7%). Age at diagnosis, ethnicity, type of family member with prostate cancer, and type of second cancer were not associated with risk of carrying any P/LP variant. Ashkenazi Jewish men (6.7%) were more likely to carry P/LP BRCA2 variants than Caucasian men (2.8%) (P < 0.05). Two-hundred eighty-four men (21.0%) carried a VUS, and AAC (36.6%) and API (33.3%) men were most likely to carry a VUS (P < 0.01).  Conclusions:   P/LP germline variants are prevalent in men with prostate cancer. AAC, Hispanic, and API men with prostate cancer are under-represented in studies of germline testing, potentially contributing to higher rates of VUS relative to Caucasian and Ashkenazi Jewish men. Further studies in these groups will facilitate reclassification of VUS, increasing opportunities for early detection, cancer risk modification, and targeted therapeutics.""","""['Daniel Hyuck-Min Kwon', 'Hala T Borno', 'Heather H Cheng', 'Alicia Yiran Zhou', 'Eric Jay Small']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Urol Oncol""","""['Germline Variant Spectrum Among African American Men Undergoing Prostate Cancer Germline Testing: Need for Equity in Genetic Testing.', 'Germline alterations among Hispanic men with prostate cancer.', 'Inequities in multi-gene hereditary cancer testing: lower diagnostic yield and higher VUS rate in individuals who identify as Hispanic, African or Asian and Pacific Islander as compared to European.', 'Prevalence of Germline BRCA1/2 Variants in Ashkenazi and Non-Ashkenazi Prostate Cancer Populations: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.', 'Bringing Prostate Cancer Germline Genetics into Clinical Practice.', 'Internet-Based Germline Genetic Testing for Men With Metastatic Prostate Cancer.', 'Germline Variants in DNA Damage Repair Genes and HOXB13 Among Black Patients With Early-Onset Prostate Cancer.', 'Recommendations for the implementation of genetic testing for metastatic prostate cancer patients in Canada.', 'Germline Variant Spectrum Among African American Men Undergoing Prostate Cancer Germline Testing: Need for Equity in Genetic Testing.', 'Germline genetics of prostate cancer.']"""

ENZA is extensively metabolized by cytochrome P450 3A4 into N-desmethyl ENZA (NDE), an active metabolite. We aimed to explore the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationship for ENZA and NDE in metastatic CRPC patients from a real-world setting.  Patients and methods:   Trough plasma concentration (Ctrough) of ENZA and NDE were assayed using liquid chromatography coupled with UV detection. The relationship between ENZA, NDE, and composite (ENZA with NDE) plasma concentration and requirement of ENZA dose reduction was investigated using the Mann-Whitney test. A survival univariate analysis was conducted to explore association between progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and plasma Ctrough (ENZA, NDE, and composite).  Results:   Twenty-two metastatic CRPC patients treated with ENZA (median age, 75.5 years; 13 patients (59%) with Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group status 0-1) were prospectively included. Mean plasma Ctrough of ENZA and NDE were 12.4 ± 3.0 μg/mL and 8.8 ± 2.1 μg/mL, respectively. Neither PFS nor OS were statistically associated with ENZA, NDE, or composite plasma Ctrough. In 4 patients (18%) who required ENZA dose reduction because of severe clinical toxicity, an increased ENZA plasma Ctrough was observed compared with 18 remaining patients (16.1 ± 2.4 μg/mL vs. 11.6 ± 2.6 μg/mL, respectively; P = .027).  Conclusion:   The low interindividual variability in ENZA and NDE Ctrough and the lack of relationship with survival do not support the need for plasma drug monitoring.

This work aims to develop an automated computed tomography (CT) multi-organ segmentation method for prostate cancer treatment planning.  Methods and materials:   The proposed method exploits the superior soft-tissue information provided by synthetic MRI (sMRI) to aid the multi-organ segmentation on pelvic CT images. A cycle generative adversarial network (CycleGAN) was used to estimate sMRIs from CT images. A deep attention U-Net (DAUnet) was trained on sMRI and corresponding multi-organ contours for auto-segmentation. The deep attention strategy was introduced to identify the most relevant features to differentiate different organs. Deep supervision was incorporated into the DAUnet to enhance the features' discriminative ability. Segmented contours of a patient were obtained by feeding CT image into the trained CycleGAN to generate sMRI, which was then fed to the trained DAUnet to generate organ contours. We trained and evaluated our model with 140 datasets from prostate patients.  Results:   The Dice similarity coefficient and mean surface distance between our segmented and bladder, prostate, and rectum manual contours were 0.95 ± 0.03, 0.52 ± 0.22 mm; 0.87 ± 0.04, 0.93 ± 0.51 mm; and 0.89 ± 0.04, 0.92 ± 1.03 mm, respectively.

Compared to photons, PT dose distributions have a reduced NT low-to-intermediate 'dose bath' and a different biological effectiveness, questioning the applicability of photon-based NT complication probability (NTCP) models to PT. The aim of this study was to assess the applicability of photon-based NTCP models to rectum morbidity outcomes following PT.  Materials and methods:   Treatment planning and morbidity data from 1151 prostate cancer patients treated with passive scattering PT and from 159 patients treated with conventional 3D conformal four-field photon therapy were analysed. Prospectively scored gastrointestinal morbidities (grade >=2) were analysed, with a total of 184 events (protons; medical and procedural) and 12 events (photons; procedural only), respectively. Rectal dose volume histograms were extracted for all patients in both cohorts and used as input to two different NTCP models, with up to six different published photon-based parameter sets.  Results:   Photon-based rectal NTCP models either over- or underestimated the clinically observed gastrointestinal morbidity when used on the proton cohort, depending on the choice of endpoint (p < 0.05 for all parameter sets, for both morbidity classifications). Four of the six photon-based NTCP models showed a good fit to the photon outcome data (p > 0.05).

While relatively understudied, recent reports have identified KLK14 as overexpressed during PCa development. However, the modulation of KLK14 expression during PCa progression and the molecular and biological functions of this protease in the prostate tumor microenvironment remain unknown. To determine the modulation of KLK14 expression during PCa progression, we analyzed the expression levels of KLK14 in patient samples using publicly available databases and immunohistochemistry. In order to delineate the molecular mechanisms involving KLK14 in PCa progression, we integrated proteomic, transcriptomic, and in vitro assays with the goal to identify substrates, related-signaling pathways, and functional roles of this protease. We showed that KLK14 expression is elevated in advanced PCa, and particularly in metastasis. Additionally, KLK14 levels were found to be decreased in PCa tissues from patients responsive to neoadjuvant therapy compared to untreated patients. Furthermore, we also identified that KLK14 expression reoccurred in patients who developed castrate-resistant PCa. The combination of proteomic and transcriptomic analysis as well as functional assays revealed several new KLK14 substrates (agrin, desmoglein 2, vitronectin, laminins) and KLK14-regulated genes (Interleukin 32, midkine, SRY-Box 9), particularly an involvement of the mitogen-activated protein kinase 1 and interleukin 1 receptor pathways, and an involvement of KLK14 in the regulation of cellular migration, supporting its involvement in aggressive features of PCa progression. In conclusion, our work showed that KLK14 expression is associated with the development of aggressive PCa suggesting that targeting this protease could offer a novel route to limit the progression of prostate tumors. Additional work is necessary to determine the benefits and implications of targeting/cotargeting KLK14 in PCa as well as to determine the potential use of KLK14 expression as a predictor of PCa aggressiveness or response to treatment.""","""['Thomas Kryza', 'Nathalie Bock', 'Scott Lovell', 'Anja Rockstroh', 'Melanie L Lehman', 'Adam Lesner', 'Janaththani Panchadsaram', 'Lakmali Munasinghage Silva', 'Srilakshmi Srinivasan', 'Cameron E Snell', 'Elizabeth D Williams', 'Ladan Fazli', 'Martin Gleave', 'Jyotsna Batra', 'Colleen Nelson', 'Edward W Tate', 'Jonathan Harris', 'John D Hooper', 'Judith A Clements']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Mol Oncol""","""['The kallikrein 14 gene is down-regulated by androgen receptor signalling and harbours genetic variation that is associated with prostate tumour aggressiveness.', 'Differential expression of the human kallikrein gene 14 (KLK14) in normal and cancerous prostatic tissues.', 'MicroRNA-3162-5p-Mediated Crosstalk between Kallikrein Family Members Including Prostate-Specific Antigen in Prostate Cancer.', 'Proteomic and other analyses to determine the functional consequences of deregulated kallikrein-related peptidase (KLK) expression in prostate and ovarian cancer.', 'The kallikrein-related peptidase family: Dysregulation and functions during cancer progression.', 'A KLK6 Activity-Based Probe Reveals a Role for KLK6 Activity in Pancreatic Cancer Cell Invasion.', 'Novel specific activity-based probes validate KLK proteases as druggable targets.', 'Activity-Based Probes for Proteases Pave the Way to Theranostic Applications.', 'Proteomics and functional study reveal kallikrein-6 enhances communicating hydrocephalus.', 'Phosphinate esters as novel warheads for activity-based probes targeting serine proteases.']"""

Materials and methods:   A total of 91 prostate cancer (PCa) patients and 50 benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) patients were enrolled from January 2016 to December 2017. The proportions of CD3+CD69+ T-cells and CD8+CD28+ T-cells in the peripheral blood of PCa and BPH patients were detected by flow cytometry, and the association of these T-cell populations with pathological Grade Group and pathological TNM classification was evaluated. Data analysis was performed with SAS version 9.4 software.  Results:   The proportions of CD3+CD69+ and CD8+CD28+ T-cells in peripheral blood were higher in PCa patients than those in BPH patients. Multivariate analysis identified a higher CD3+CD69+ T-cell proportion as a risk factor for PCa (odds ratio (OR) = 4.783, P = 0.0013), but the diagnostic efficacy of the CD3+CD69+ T-cell proportion (area under the curve (AUC)=0.6833, P = 0.0003) for PCa was still inferior to that of the tPSA level (AUC=0.7531, P < 0.0001).

However, annotated medical data, especially multimodal data, is often scarce and costly to obtain. In this paper, we address the problem of synthesizing multi-parameter magnetic resonance imaging data (i.e. mp-MRI), which typically consists of Apparent Diffusion Coefficient (ADC) and T2-weighted (T2w) images, containing clinically significant (CS) prostate cancer (PCa) via semi-supervised learning and adversarial learning. Specifically, our synthesizer generates mp-MRI data in a sequential manner: first utilizing a decoder to generate an ADC map from a 128-d latent vector, followed by translating the ADC to the T2w image via U-Net. The synthesizer is trained in a semi-supervised manner. In the supervised training process, a limited amount of paired ADC-T2w images and the corresponding ADC encodings are provided and the synthesizer learns the paired relationship by explicitly minimizing the reconstruction losses between synthetic and real images. To avoid overfitting limited ADC encodings, an unlimited amount of random latent vectors and unpaired ADC-T2w Images are utilized in the unsupervised training process for learning the marginal image distributions of real images. To improve the robustness for training the synthesizer, we decompose the difficult task of generating full-size images into several simpler tasks which generate sub-images only. A StitchLayer is then employed to seamlessly fuse sub-images together in an interlaced manner into a full-size image. In addition, to enforce the synthetic images to indeed contain distinguishable CS PCa lesions, we propose to also maximize an auxiliary distance of Jensen-Shannon divergence (JSD) between CS and nonCS images. Experimental results show that our method can effectively synthesize a large variety of mp-MRI images which contain meaningful CS PCa lesions, display a good visual quality and have the correct paired relationship between the two modalities of a pair. Compared to the state-of-the-art methods based on adversarial learning (Liu and Tuzel, 2016; Costa et al., 2017), our method achieves a significant improvement in terms of both visual quality and several popular quantitative evaluation metrics.""","""['Zhiwei Wang', 'Yi Lin', 'Kwang-Ting Tim Cheng', 'Xin Yang']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Med Image Anal""","""['Co-trained convolutional neural networks for automated detection of prostate cancer in multi-parametric MRI.', 'Automated diagnosis of prostate cancer in multi-parametric MRI based on multimodal convolutional neural networks.', 'Bi-Modality Medical Image Synthesis Using Semi-Supervised Sequential Generative Adversarial Networks.', 'Multiparametric MRI in detection and staging of prostate cancer.', 'Unsupervised Image-to-Image Translation: A Review.', 'Enhancing cancer differentiation with synthetic MRI examinations via generative models: a systematic review.', 'MEDAS: an open-source platform as a service to help break the walls between medicine and informatics.', 'Artificial intelligence and machine learning for medical imaging: A technology review.', 'Multimodal MRI synthesis using unified generative adversarial networks.']"""

The release of BPA from these products results in a permanent human exposition to BPA; however, the quality and quantity of BPA adverse effects remain a matter of controversy. The common presence of BPA in the human environment and the controversies concerning the relations of human exposition to BPA and cancer incidence justify the research on the interactions between BPA and pro-metastatic signaling in cancer cells. Here, we describe a novel BPA-reactive signaling axis that induces the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in lung adenocarcinoma A549 cells. BPA exerted negligible effects on their properties in a wide range of concentrations (10 nM - 100 nM), whereas it considerably induced A549 invasiveness at high concentrations (10 μM). The BPA-induced EMT was illustrated by morphologic changes, E/N-cadherin switch and vimentin/Snail-1/connexin(Cx)43 up-regulation in A549 populations. It was followed by enhancement of A549 drug-resistance. Corresponding effects of BPA were observed in prostate cancer cell populations. Concomitantly, we observed increased levels and perinuclear accumulation of estrogen-related receptor gamma (ERRγ) in BPA-treated cells, its interactions with Cx43/Snail-1, and the corresponding effects of phenol red on A549 cells. Collectively, these data identify a novel, pro-metastatic Snail-1/Cx43/ERRγ signaling pathway. Its reactivity to BPA underlies the induction of cancer cells' invasiveness in the presence of high BPA concentrations in vitro.

Methods and materials:   From 2009 to 2018, 50 patients with biopsy-proven recurrent prostate cancer >2 years after prior treatment were retreated with a high dose-rate-like dose of 3400 cGy over 5 fractions. Previous radiation therapy dose measured 75.6 Gy (64.8-81.0) and median salvage interval was 8.1 years (32-241 mo.). Eighty-three percent of patients had Gleason score 7 or higher disease at retreatment. Those with preexisting toxicity >grade 1 from their prior course were excluded. The planning target volume was comprised of the clinical target volume (prostate + any contiguous extension only) with no additional expansion. Toxicity assessment used CTCAE v.3.0 criteria.  Results:   Median follow-up was 44 months (3-110). Median pre-SBRT salvage baseline prostate specific antigen (PSA) of 3.97 ng/mL decreased to 0.6 ng/mL and 0.16 ng/mL at 1 and 5 years in nonrelapsed patients, respectively. Actuarial 5-year biochemical disease-free survival (DFS) measured 60%, with corresponding 5-year actuarial local, distant, and salvage androgen deprivation therapy free rates of 94%, 89%, and 69%, respectively. Actuarial 5-year biochemical DFS measured 78% if PSA at salvage was <6.92 ng/mL versus 12% with ≥6.92 ng/mL (P = .0001).

As treatment complexity increases, it is important to consider what effect this may have on treatment time. Additional factors that may influence treatment times are patient-centered care and mobility status. The aim of this study is to determine optimal radiation treatment appointment times based on site, technique, imaging requirements, and patient needs.  Methods:   Data from 535 fractions of radiation treatments were collected and analyzed between June 2016 and July 2017 by a team of eight radiation therapists at BC Cancer Vancouver Centre. Data collectors documented a number of data points, including treatment unit, scheduled appointment time, scheduled appointment duration (booked in 12 minute increments), treatment site, treatment technique, imaging modality, pre-treatment-related and post-treatment-related activity time, patient mobility status, etc. Student's t-test was performed for each site/technique to determine if the mean total treatment time was significantly different from the standard appointment time for that site. A two-sample unpaired t-test assuming unequal variance was used to compare average treatment times of the same site with different imaging modalities. Student's t-test was also used to compare average treatment times for ambulatory patients versus patients requiring some form of mobility assistance.  Results:   Average treatment times for 6 of the 10 sites used for data analysis were longer than standard booked times and showed statistical significance (prostate/prostate bed: n = 82, P < .001; chest: n = 32, P < .001, palliative 1 treatment site: n = 28, P < .05, gyne pelvis only treatment: n = 25, P < .001, head & neck: n = 56, P < .001, and rectum: n = 28, P < 0.05). The breast/chest wall + nodes site had a significantly shorter treatment time than the standard booked appointment time (n = 87, P < .001). Analysis of the prostate/prostate bed imaging showed a significant difference between daily cone beam computed tomography and daily kilovoltage treatment time, with cone beam computed tomography imaging taking 3.83 ± 1.36 (P < .001) minutes longer on average than kilovoltage imaging. Average treatment time for patients requiring mobility assistance was 20% longer than for patients requiring no assistance (P = .02).  Conclusion:   The majority of the most common sites and techniques treated at our centre were inappropriately booked. Radiation therapy appointment durations are influenced by several factors, including site, technique complexity, imaging, and patient care. It is recommended that radiation treatment centres evaluate appointment times regularly as technology, treatment delivery, and professional practice standards evolve to ensure high-quality patient care.""","""['Evan Stewart', 'Ian Sun', 'Cecilia Kim', 'Alison Giddings', 'Francis Silverio', 'Olivia Taruc', 'Luminita Nica']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""J Med Imaging Radiat Sci""","""['Does Interfraction Cone Beam Computed Tomography Improve Target Localization in Prostate Bed Radiotherapy?', 'Impact of rectal distension on prostate CBCT-based positioning assessed with 6 degrees-of-freedom couch.', 'Assessment of interfraction patient setup for head-and-neck cancer intensity modulated radiation therapy using multiple computed tomography-based image guidance.', 'Current status of intensity-modulated radiation therapy for prostate cancer: History, clinical results and future directions.', 'A review of cone-beam CT applications for adaptive radiotherapy of prostate cancer.', 'Twenty Years of Advancements in a Radiotherapy Facility: Clinical Protocols, Technology, and Management.']"""

To date, the role of androgen deprivation therapy has not been formally shown. In this follow-up study, we aimed to update the results of the GETUG-AFU 16 trial, which assessed the efficacy of radiotherapy plus androgen suppression versus radiotherapy alone.  Methods:   GETUG-AFU 16 was an open-label, multicentre, phase 3, randomised, controlled trial that enrolled men (aged ≥18 years) with Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1, with histologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the prostate (but no previous androgen suppression or pelvic radiotherapy), stage pT2, T3, or T4a (bladder neck involvement only) and pN0 or pNx according to the tumour, node, metastasis (TNM) staging system, whose prostate-specific antigen (PSA) concentration increased from 0·1 ng/mL to between 0·2 ng/mL and 2·0 ng/mL after radical prostatectomy, without evidence of clinical disease. Patients were assigned through central randomisation (1:1) to short-term androgen suppression (subcutaneous injection of 10·8 mg goserelin on the first day of irradiation and 3 months later) plus radiotherapy (3D conformal radiotherapy or intensity modulated radiotherapy of 66 Gy in 33 fractions, 5 days a week for 7 weeks) or radiotherapy alone. Randomisation was stratified using a permuted block method (block sizes of two and four) according to investigational site, radiotherapy modality, and prognosis. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival in the intention-to-treat population. This post-hoc one-shot data collection done 4 years after last data cutoff included patients who were alive at the time of the primary analysis and updated long-term patient status by including dates for first local progression, metastatic disease diagnosis, or death (if any of these had occurred) or the date of the last tumour evaluation or last PSA measurement. Survival at 120 months was reported. Late serious adverse effects were assessed. This trial is registered on ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT00423475.  Findings:   Between Oct 19, 2006, and March 30, 2010, 743 patients were randomly assigned, 374 to radiotherapy alone and 369 to radiotherapy plus goserelin. At the time of data cutoff (March 12, 2019), the median follow-up was 112 months (IQR 102-123). The 120-month progression-free survival was 64% (95% CI 58-69) for patients treated with radiotherapy plus goserelin and 49% (43-54) for patients treated with radiotherapy alone (hazard ratio 0·54, 0·43-0·68; stratified log-rank test p<0·0001). Two cases of secondary cancer occurred since the primary analysis, but were not considered to be treatment related. No treatment-related deaths occurred.  Interpretation:   The 120-month progression-free survival confirmed the results from the primary analysis. Salvage radiotherapy combined with short-term androgen suppression significantly reduced risk of biochemical or clinical progression and death compared with salvage radiotherapy alone. The results of the GETUG-AFU 16 trial confirm the efficacy of androgen suppression plus radiotherapy as salvage treatment in patients with increasing PSA concentration after radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer.

Methods:   425 men were treated with external beam radiotherapy (59.4 Gy, 33 fractions) and 125J seed-brachytherapy (S-BT, 100 Gy). Biochemical recurrence (BR) was defined either as radio-oncologic (rBR), using a +2 ng/mL prostate-specific antigen (PSA) increase above a nadir value, or as surgical (sBR), using a 2-year posttreatment PSA of ≥0.2 ng/mL. Biochemical recurrence-free, metastasis-free, cancer-specific, and overall survival were calculated at 5 and 10 years using the Kaplan-Meier method. Standard validation tests were used to compare both thresholds.  Results:   After a median of 7 years, overall recurrence rates were 10.4% and 31.5% for rBR and sBR definitions, respectively. Both failure definitions proved sensitive for the prediction of metastases and cancer-specific death, whereas the rBR definition was significantly more specific. The accuracies of a correct prediction of metastases and death of prostate cancer were 73.1% vs. 96.2% and 72.2% vs. 92.9% for sBR vs. rBR, respectively. The inferior validity results of the sBR definition were attributable to a PSA-bounce phenomenon occurring in 56% of patients with sBR. Still, using the less suitable sBR definition, the results of CRT compared favorably to BRFS rates of surgical interventions.

Transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) has remained the reference standard for men with prostates sized 30 cc-80 cc, while open prostatectomy is universally guidelines-recommended in the absence of enucleation, for men with prostates larger than 80 cc-100 cc. While these techniques are effective, they have the potential for bleeding complications requiring transfusions, electrolyte abnormalities such as TURP syndrome, and often require prolonged hospitalization. GreenLight photoselective vaporization (GL-PVP) with the XPS LBO-180W system offers a minimally invasive treatment that can be carried out on essential any sized prostate gland. In addition, the GL-PVP procedure can be done as a same day discharge surgery requiring no overnight hospital admission and allows patients to continue any necessary anti-coagulants given the significantly reduced risks of bleeding complications or TURP syndrome. In 2005, the anatomic vaporization-incision technique (VIT) using the XPS LBO-180W system was described to address larger prostate volumes. VIT combines principles of traditional GL-PVP and enucleation techniques to identify the reference surgical capsule early-on into the surgery and resect portions of prostate adenoma without the need for tissue morcellation. Early studies comparing anatomic VIT to standard PVP outcomes demonstrated significant improvements of IPSS and uroflowmetry parameters, along with statistically significant greater PSA reduction at 6 months, particularly in prostate volumes greater than 80 cc. The objective of this article is to detail our surgical approach to the anatomic GreenLight laser vaporization-incision technique using the XPS LBO-180W system, based on extensive personal experience with both enucleation and vaporization techniques using various laser technologies. Standardization of the VIT based on proper cystoscopy, knowledge of prostate anatomy with preoperative ultrasound, and routine technique is essential to developing consistent, reproducible and optimal surgical outcomes.""","""['Kyle W Law', 'Dean S Elterman', 'Hannes Cash', 'Enrique Rijo', 'Bilal Chughtai', 'Vincent Misrai', 'Kevin C Zorn']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Can J Urol""","""['GreenLight 180W XPS photovaporization of the prostate: how I do it.', 'How I Do It: GreenLight XPS 180W photoselective vaporization of the prostate.', 'Application of 180W XPS GreenLight laser vaporization of the prostate for treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia.', 'Photoselective vaporization of the prostate: application, outcomes and safety.', 'A systematic review of experience of 180-W XPS GreenLight laser vaporisation of the prostate in 1640 men.', 'A Delphi consensus to standardize the technique of anatomical endoscopic enucleation of prostate: a study by ESUT endoscopic enucleation of prostate study group.', 'Impact of the presence of a median lobe on functional outcomes of greenlight photovaporization of the prostate (PVP): an analysis of the Global Greenlight Group (GGG) Database.', 'Reasons to believe in vaporization: a review of the benefits of photo-selective and transurethral vaporization.']"""

Materials and methods:   Data was collected from the 2005-2015 Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program. Incidence of prostate cancer diagnosis was categorized and analyzed by stage, race/ethnicity, and age group. Appropriate univariate and multivariable statistical analysis was performed.  Results:   The odds of being diagnosed with regional-stage prostate cancer in 2013-2015 were 1.3 times higher for black men, 1.3 times higher for Asian American/Pacific Islander (AAPI) men, and 1.2 times higher for white men when compared to 2005-2008. The odds of being diagnosed with distant-stage prostate cancer in 2013-2015 were 1.6 times higher for black men, 1.8 times higher for AAPI men, and 2.1 times higher for white men when compared to 2005-2008. In 2005-2008, 2009-2012, and 2013-2015 respectively, the odds of being diagnosed with distant-stage prostate cancer were 1.8 times higher, 1.7 times higher, and 1.4 times higher for black men compared to white men, and 1.5 times higher, 1.5 times higher, and 1.4 times higher for AAPI men compared to white men (all respective p < .001).  Conclusions:   The proportion of late-stage prostate cancer has increased significantly in all US males regardless of race and/or ethnicity. From 2013-2015, all men had a higher chance of being diagnosed with regional or distant stage disease compared to years prior.

However, the assumption that all PC lesions uniformly exhibit increasing tracer uptake at delayed imaging has not yet been investigated, which this present study aims to address.  Methods:   One hundred consecutive patients with biochemically recurrent PC who received standard and late [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT (by local protocol at 1.5 h ""standard"" and 2.5 h p.i. ""late"") underwent retrospective evaluation. All lesions with a tracer uptake above local background were analysed with regard to their maximum standardised uptake values at standard and late images (SUVmax) and characterised according to their morphological characteristics.  Results:   Seventy-nine of 100 patients had PSMA-positive scans, in whom a total of 185 individual PSMA-positive lesions were identified. These were morphologically characterised as bone lesions (n = 48), solid organ lesions (n = 3), lymph node (LN) lesions (n = 78) and locally recurrent lesions in the prostatic fossa or seminal vesicles (n = 56). The relative uptake between standard and late imaging was considered; all lesions classified as local recurrence presented with increasing (86%) or stable patterns of tracer uptake (14%). In contrast, only 58% of bone lesions exhibited increasing tracer uptake, with 21% exhibiting a stable pattern and 21% exhibiting a decreasing tracer uptake at late imaging.  Conclusion:   A heterogeneous pattern of dynamic tracer uptake was observed, with a largely increasing pattern observed for locally recurrent lesions and lymph nodes and a significant proportion of bone lesions exhibiting decreasing tracer uptake. The results are of significance not only in the imaging and identification of PC lesions, but they also have implications for PSMA-directed ligand therapy.""","""['Ian Alberts', 'Christos Sachpekidis', 'Eleni Gourni', 'Silvan Boxler', 'Tobias Gross', 'George Thalmann', 'Kambiz Rahbar', 'Axel Rominger', 'Ali Afshar-Oromieh']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Eur J Nucl Med Mol Imaging""","""['More advantages in detecting bone and soft tissue metastases from prostate cancer using 18F-PSMA PET/CT.', 'The role of additional late PSMA-ligand PET/CT in the differentiation between lymph node metastases and ganglia.', 'Early dynamic imaging in 68Ga- PSMA-11 PET/CT allows discrimination of urinary bladder activity and prostate cancer lesions.', '68Ga-PSMA-PET/CT Has a Role in Detecting Prostate Cancer Lesions in Patients with Recurrent Disease.', 'Use of gallium-68 prostate-specific membrane antigen positron-emission tomography for detecting lymph node metastases in primary and recurrent prostate cancer and location of recurrence after radical prostatectomy: an overview of the current literature.', 'Multiparametric dynamic whole-body PSMA PET/CT using 68GaGa-PSMA-11 and 18FPSMA-1007.', 'Long-axial field-of-view PET/CT: perspectives and review of a revolutionary development in nuclear medicine based on clinical experience in over 7000 patients.', 'Combined forced diuresis and late acquisition on 68GaGa-PSMA-11 PET/CT for biochemical recurrent prostate cancer: a clinical practice-oriented study.', 'Reliability of gradient-based segmentation for measuring metabolic parameters influenced by uptake time on 18F-PSMA-1007 PET/CT for prostate cancer.', 'Evaluation of 68\xa0GaGa-PSMA-I&T PET/CT with additional late scans of the pelvis in prostate-specific antigen recurrence using the PROMISE criteria.']"""

In a cohort of 11 PDE tissues from eight individual patients, LC-MS/MS quantification of PDE homogenates confirmed enzalutamide (10 µM) uptake by all PDEs, which reached maximal average tissue concentration of 0.24-0.50 ng/µg protein after 48 h culture. Time dependent uptake of enzalutamide (50 µM) in PDEs was visualized using MALDI MSI over 24-48 h, with complete penetration throughout tissues evident by 6 h of culture. Drug signal intensity was not homogeneous throughout the tissues but had areas of markedly high signal that corresponded to drug target (androgen receptor)-rich epithelial regions of tissue.

The processing of downloaded data files began with quality checks using NOISeq, followed by WGCNA. Our results confirmed the quality of the TCGA transcriptome data, identified 12 co-expression networks, and demonstrated that CXCL13, CXCR5 and associated genes are members of signaling networks (modules) associated with G protein coupled receptor (GPCR) responsiveness, invasion/migration, immune checkpoint, and innate immunity.

Green fluorescent protein-positive prostate carcinoma cells in a hydrogel or excised tumor xenografts from mice were placed into primary tumor sites and either human bone stromal cells (HS-5) in a hydrogel or human-derived bone chips were seeded into metastatic sites. Cells from the primary sites migrated to and grew in metastatic sites. Bone enhanced growth at metastatic sites and established a CXCL12 gradient that was higher in metastatic versus primary sites. AMD3100-mediated inhibition of CXCL12 function reduced the number of cells targeting the bone at the metastatic sites.

However, the limitations of SCS technologies including frequent allele dropout and variable sequence coverage may prohibit a perfect phylogeny. In addition, ISA violations are commonly observed in tumor phylogenies due to the loss of heterozygosity, deletions, and convergent evolution. In order to address such limitations, we introduce the optimal subperfect phylogeny problem which asks to integrate SCS data with matching bulk sequencing data by minimizing a linear combination of potential false negatives (due to allele dropout or variance in sequence coverage), false positives (due to read errors) among mutation calls, and the number of mutations that violate ISA (real or because of incorrect copy number estimation). We then describe a combinatorial formulation to solve this problem which ensures that several lineage constraints imposed by the use of variant allele frequencies (VAFs, derived from bulk sequence data) are satisfied. We express our formulation both in the form of an integer linear program (ILP) and-as a first in tumor phylogeny reconstruction-a Boolean constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) and solve them by leveraging state-of-the-art ILP/CSP solvers. The resulting method, which we name PhISCS, is the first to integrate SCS and bulk sequencing data while accounting for ISA violating mutations. In contrast to the alternative methods, typically based on probabilistic approaches, PhISCS provides a guarantee of optimality in reported solutions. Using simulated and real data sets, we demonstrate that PhISCS is more general and accurate than all available approaches.""","""['Salem Malikic', 'Farid Rashidi Mehrabadi', 'Simone Ciccolella', 'Md Khaledur Rahman', 'Camir Ricketts', 'Ehsan Haghshenas', 'Daniel Seidman', 'Faraz Hach', 'Iman Hajirasouliha', 'S Cenk Sahinalp']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Genome Res""","""['PhISCS-BnB: a fast branch and bound algorithm for the perfect tumor phylogeny reconstruction problem.', 'Parameter, noise, and tree topology effects in tumor phylogeny inference.', 'Integrative inference of subclonal tumour evolution from single-cell and bulk sequencing data.', 'High Throughput Single Cell RNA Sequencing, Bioinformatics Analysis and Applications.', 'High-throughput dense reconstruction of cell lineages.', 'A weighted distance-based approach for deriving consensus tumor evolutionary trees.', 'ConDoR: Tumor phylogeny inference with a copy-number constrained mutation loss model.', 'Scelestial: Fast and accurate single-cell lineage tree inference based on a Steiner tree approximation algorithm.', 'Semi-deconvolution of bulk and single-cell RNA-seq data with application to metastatic progression in breast cancer.', 'Reconstructing tumor clonal lineage trees incorporating single-nucleotide variants, copy number alterations and structural variations.']"""

The confidence in the interpretation of PSMA-positive locoregional findings was scored on a 5-point scale, first in routine diagnostics (reader 1) and then by an independent second evaluation (reader 2). Discordant PSMA-positive skeletal findings were examined by contrast-enhanced MRI. Results: For both readers, 18F-PSMA-1007 facilitated the interpretability of 27 locoregional lesions. In PET-2, the clinical readout led to a significantly lower number of equivocal locoregional lesions (P = 0.024), and reader 2 reported a significantly higher rate of suspected lesions that were falsely interpreted as probably benign in PET-1 (P = 0.023). Exclusively in PET-2, we observed a total of 15 PSMA-positive spots in the bone marrow of 6 patients (22%). None of the 15 discordant spots had a morphologic correlate on the corresponding CT scan or on the subsequent MRI scan. Thus, 18F-PSMA-1007 exhibits a significantly higher rate of unspecific medullary spots (P = 0.0006).

Methods:   Patients (pts) eligible for this multicenter prospective cohort study suffered from low to intermediate risk localized CaP with no prior treatment. After tumor identification on multiparametric MRI and in prostate biopsy, the lesions were treated with HIFU observing a safety margin of 8 to 10 mm.

Four pts (4.1%) underwent subsequent intervention (Clavien-Dindo grade IIIa/b). The number of late postoperative complications occurring between 30 and 90 days after intervention was low (2.0%). The highest complication rate was associated with tumors located at the anterior base (50.0%).

In prostate cancer, generation of constitutively active forms of androgen receptor (AR) variants including AR-V7 plays an important role in progression of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). AR-V7 is generated by alternative splicing that results in inclusion of cryptic exon CE3 and translation of truncated AR protein that lacks the ligand binding domain. Whether AR-V7 can be a driver for CRPC remains controversial as the oncogenic mechanism of AR-V7 activation remains elusive. Here, we found that KDM4B promotes AR-V7 and identified a novel regulatory mechanism. KDM4B is phosphorylated by protein kinase A under conditions that promote castration-resistance, eliciting its binding to the splicing factor SF3B3. KDM4B binds RNA specifically near the 5'-CE3, upregulates the chromatin accessibility, and couples the spliceosome to the chromatin. Our data suggest that KDM4B can function as a signal responsive trans-acting splicing factor and scaffold that recruits and stabilizes the spliceosome near the alternative exon, thus promoting its inclusion. Genome-wide profiling of KDM4B-regulated genes also identified additional alternative splicing events implicated in tumorigenesis. Our study defines KDM4B-regulated alternative splicing as a pivotal mechanism for generating AR-V7 and a contributing factor for CRPC, providing insight for mechanistic targeting of CRPC.""","""['Lingling Duan', 'Zhenhua Chen', 'Jun Lu', 'Yanping Liang', 'Ming Wang', 'Carlos M Roggero', 'Qing-Jun Zhang', 'Jason Gao', 'Yong Fang', 'Jiazheng Cao', 'Jian Lu', 'Hongwei Zhao', 'Andrew Dang', 'Rey-Chen Pong', 'Elizabeth Hernandez', 'Chun-Mien Chang', 'David T Hoang', 'Jung-Mo Ahn', 'Guanghua Xiao', 'Rui-Tao Wang', 'Kai-Jiang Yu', 'Payal Kapur', 'Josep Rizo', 'Jer-Tsong Hsieh', 'Junhang Luo', 'Zhi-Ping Liu']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Nucleic Acids Res""","""['Targeting KDM4B that coactivates c-Myc-regulated metabolism to suppress tumor growth in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Histone demethylase JMJD1A promotes alternative splicing of AR variant 7 (AR-V7) in prostate cancer cells.', 'Upregulated KDM4B promotes prostate cancer cell proliferation by activating autophagy.', 'Alternative splicing in prostate cancer.', 'AR-V7 in Metastatic Prostate Cancer: A Strategy beyond Redemption.', 'Engineering prostate cancer in vitro: what does it take?', 'The KDM5B and KDM1A lysine demethylases cooperate in regulating androgen receptor expression and signalling in prostate cancer.', 'Jumonji domain-containing protein RIOX2 is overexpressed and associated with worse survival outcomes in prostate cancers.', 'Chromatin Regulator-Related Gene Signature for Predicting Prognosis and Immunotherapy Efficacy in Breast Cancer.', 'The androgen receptor-targeted proteolysis targeting chimera and other alternative therapeutic choices in overcoming the resistance to androgen deprivation treatment in prostate cancer.']"""

Icaritin (ICT) is a traditional Chinese herbal medicine that exhibits antitumor efficacy in variety of cancers including PCa. However, the precise function and detailed molecular mechanism of ICT in the regression of PCa remain unclear. Ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2C (UBE2C) is an anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C)-specific ubiquitin conjugating enzyme, which acts as an oncogene in PCa progression. The function of ICT in PCa was investigated in transgenic adenocarcinoma mouse prostate (TRAMP) mice using survival analysis, hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining, TUNEL assay, and immunohistochemistry and in human PCa cell lines using various molecular techniques and functional assays including plasmid construction and transfection. Bioinformatic analyses were performed to identify the interaction between miRNA and UBE2C via the TargetScan algorithm. We demonstrated that ICT inhibited the development and progression of PCa in TRAMP mice by improving the survival rate and tumor differentiation. Furthermore, we found that ICT could significantly inhibit cell proliferation and invasion and induce apoptosis in PCa cells. Consistently, downregulation of UBE2C suppressed the proliferation and invasion of PCa cells. Moreover, a luciferase reporter assay confirmed that UBE2C was a direct target of miR-381-3p. Meanwhile, ICT simultaneously downregulated UBE2C expression and upregulated miR-381-3p levels in human PCa cells. Altogether, our findings provide a strong rationale for the clinical application of ICT as a potential oncotherapeutic agent against PCa via a novel molecular mechanism of regulating the miR-381-3p/UBE2C pathway.""","""['Jimeng Hu', 'Xiaobo Wu', 'Chen Yang', 'Khalid Rashid', 'Chenkai Ma', 'Mengbo Hu', 'Qiang Ding', 'Haowen Jiang']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Cancer Med""","""['UBE2C, Directly Targeted by miR-548e-5p, Increases the Cellular Growth and Invasive Abilities of Cancer Cells Interacting with the EMT Marker Protein Zinc Finger E-box Binding Homeobox 1/2 in NSCLC.', 'A novel prostate cancer therapeutic strategy using icaritin-activated arylhydrocarbon-receptor to co-target androgen receptor and its splice variants.', 'MicroRNA-196a post-transcriptionally upregulates the UBE2C proto-oncogene and promotes cell proliferation in breast cancer.', 'Ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2C: a potential cancer biomarker.', 'Ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme UBE2C: molecular biology, role in tumorigenesis, and potential as a biomarker.', 'Ubiquitination Links DNA Damage and Repair Signaling to Cancer Metabolism.', 'Icaritin Derivative IC2 Induces Cytoprotective Autophagy of Breast Cancer Cells via SCD1 Inhibition.', 'Overexpression of Ubiquitin-Conjugating Enzyme E2C Is Associated with Worsened Prognosis in Prostate Cancer.', 'm6A Methylation Regulators Are Predictive Biomarkers for Tumour Metastasis in Prostate Cancer.', 'Overexpressed lncRNA FTX promotes the cell viability, proliferation, migration and invasion of renal cell carcinoma via FTX/miR‑4429/UBE2C axis.']"""

In CRC, the function of some lncRNAs has been verified to be related to cell proliferation, apoptosis, migration and invasion, providing a crucial theoretical basis for the treatment of colorectal cancer. Due to the complexity of the regulation mechanism of cell growth, the regulation mechanism related to lncRNA still needs to be further studied in CRC.  Patients and methods:   The qRT-PCR assay was used to carry out the expression of prostate cancer-associated ncRNA transcripts 1 (PCAT-1) and miR-149-5p. The Western blots were used to measure the protein expression of CDK4, Cyclin D1, MMP-2, MMP-9, Bcl-2, Bax and β-actin. Additionally, flow cytometry and MTT assay were used to assess cell apoptosis and cell proliferation, respectively. Moreover, transwell assay was applied to measure the ability of cells migrated and invasion in CRC. Luciferase reporter assay was performed to detect luciferase activities.  Results:   In this study, lncRNA PCAT-1 expression was significantly upregulated in CRC cells and tissues. More than that, knockdown of lncRNA PCAT-1 inhibited cell proliferation, migration and invasion while promoted cell apoptosis in CRC cells. Of note, lncRNA PCAT-1 directly targeted miR-149-5p and miR-149-5p expression was significantly downregulated in CRC cells and tissues. Moreover, miR-149-3p reversed the suppressive effects of PCAT-1 on the cell growth of CRC cells.

It is commonly used for different types of tumors, such as breast and prostate cancers, in order to plan early and adequate treatment.  Objective:   To evaluate the indications, adequacy, and safety of transvaginal ultrasound-guided biopsy in women with pelvic lesions suspected of gynecologic malignancy.  Methods:   A retrospective study including all patients who had undergone transvaginal ultrasound-guided biopsy between April 2015 and May 2018 was carried out at the division of gynecologic oncology. Inclusion criteria were the presence at imaging of abdominal or pelvic tumors in patients considered not ideal candidates for primary gynecological surgery, or the origin and/or nature of the tumor was unclear and further management required histological verification. Patients with planned surgery were excluded from the study. Transvaginal biopsies were performed with a 18 G/25 cm core-cut biopsy needle and histology was obtained. Tru-cut biopsies were performed using an automatic bioptic gun with a 18 G/25 cm core-cut biopsy needle. Results are presented as absolute frequency (percentage) for nominal variables and as median (range) for continuous variables.  Results:   A total of 62 women were analyzed. An adequate sample for histological analysis was obtained in all cases. Histopathological examinations showed 24 (38.7%) benign lesions (fibrosis, inflammation, uterine or ovarian myoma) and 38 (61.3%) malignant tumors, distributed as follows: 34 (89.5%) malignant gynecological lesions and 4 (10.5%) non-gynecological malignant tumors. Among the malignant lesions, there were 12/38 (31.6%) primary tumors, 24/38 (63.2%) recurrent tumors, and 2/38 (5.3%) metastases from non-genital cancer. Ten patients eventually underwent surgery. Final histology was not in agreement with the results from transvaginal ultrasound-guided biopsy in 2 of 10 patients (20%); in particular, benign disease at transvaginal ultrasound-guided biopsy was malignant at final histology (two cases of recurrence of cervical cancer). Three patients (4.8%) had pain during the procedure, which was controlled by oral analgesic therapy and lasted for no longer than 10 min. No major complications were registered.  Conclusions:   Transvaginal ultrasound-guided biopsy is a minimally invasive method to obtain adequate material for histological diagnosis and could avoid unnecessary surgical procedures, costly CT-guided procedures, or prolonged waiting times.""","""['Floriana Mascilini', 'Lorena Quagliozzi', 'Francesca Moro', 'Maria Cristina Moruzzi', 'Ilaria De Blasis', 'Valentina Paris', 'Giovanni Scambia', 'Anna Fagotti', 'Antonia Carla Testa']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Int J Gynecol Cancer""","""['Safety and efficiency of performing transvaginal ultrasound-guided tru-cut biopsy for pelvic masses.', 'Ultrasound-guided tru-cut biopsy of abdominal and pelvic tumors in gynecology.', 'Transvaginal Ultrasound-Guided Core Needle Biopsy of Pelvic Masses.', 'Ultrasound-guided minimally invasive interventions in gynecologic oncology.', 'Pretherapeutic evaluation of patients with upper gastrointestinal tract cancer using endoscopic and laparoscopic ultrasonography.', 'Tru-Cut Biopsy in Gynecological Cancer: Adequacy, Accuracy, Safety and Clinical Applicability.', 'Primary retroperitoneal nodal endometrioid carcinoma associated with Lynch syndrome: A case report.', 'Assessment of Salvage Surgery in Persistent Cervical Cancer after Definitive Radiochemotherapy: A Systematic Review.', 'Contribution of Outpatient Ultrasound Transvaginal Biopsy and Puncture in the Diagnosis and Treatment of Pelvic Lesions: A Bicenter Study.', 'Diagnostic and Therapeutic Pathway of Advanced Ovarian Cancer with Peritoneal Metastases.']"""

The current trial evaluated the effects of this vaccine on metastatic progression.  Patients and methods:   Ninety-nine patients with castration-sensitive prostate cancer and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) doubling time (DT) of less than 12 months were randomly assigned to treatment with either pTVG-HP co-administered intradermally with 200 μg granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) adjuvant or 200 μg GM-CSF alone six times at 14-day intervals and then quarterly for 2 years. The primary end point was 2-year metastasis-free survival (MFS). Secondary and exploratory end points were median MFS, changes in PSA DT, immunologic effects, and changes in quantitative 18F-sodium fluoride (NaF) positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) imaging.  Results:   Two-year MFS was not different between study arms (41.8% vaccine v 42.3%; P = .97). Changes in PSA DT and median MFS were not different between study arms (18.9 v 18.3 months; hazard ratio [HR], 1.6; P = .13). Preplanned subset analysis identified longer MFS in vaccine-treated patients with rapid (< 3 months) pretreatment PSA DT (12.0 v 6.1 months; n = 21; HR, 4.4; P = .03). PAP-specific T cells were detected in both cohorts, including multifunctional PAP-specific T-helper 1-biased T cells. Changes in total activity (total standardized uptake value) on 18F-NaF PET/CT from months 3 to 6 increased 50% in patients treated with GM-CSF alone and decreased 23% in patients treated with pTVG-HP (n = 31; P = .07).  Conclusion:   pTVG-HP treatment did not demonstrate an overall increase in 2-year MFS in patients with castration-sensitive prostate cancer, with the possible exception of a subgroup with rapidly progressive disease. Prespecified 18F-NaF PET/CT imaging conducted in a subset of patients suggests that vaccination had detectable effects on micrometastatic bone disease.

Patients and methods:   A prospective, non-randomised, pre-post interventional trial of patients undergoing RP for prostate cancer (August 2017-November 2018) was conducted as part of the Opioid Reduction Intervention for Open, Laparoscopic, and Endoscopic Surgery (ORIOLES) Initiative. An evidence-based intervention including: a discharge sheet, nursing education, and standardised prescribing guideline, was applied with the primary outcome of total oral morphine equivalents (OMEQ) used after RP. Secondary outcomes included opioid prescribing, opioid disposal, need for additional opioid medication, and presence of incisional/post-surgical abdominal pain at 30 days after RP.  Results:   A total of 214 (Pre-Intervention arm) and 229 (Post-Intervention arm) adult patients were enrolled (100% follow-up). The intervention reduced post-discharge opioid prescribing (from 224.3 to 120.3 mg; -46.4%, P = 0.01), reduced opioid use (from 52.1 to 38.3 mg; -26.5%, P < 0.01), and increased opioid disposal (+13.5%, P < 0.01). Greater prescribing of opioids at discharge, higher body mass index, and use of opioid medication prior to surgery, were independently associated with greater post-discharge opioid use, while history of a chronic pain diagnosis was not statistically significant. In the Post-Intervention cohort, 2.2% of patients needed additional medication for post-surgical pain (0.9% obtained a prescription) and 1.3% initiated long-term use.  Conclusions:   A prospective, evidence-based intervention reduced post-discharge opioid prescribing and use, while increasing disposal after RP. Risk factors for increased opioid use were identified.

In particular, we study the effect of employing the atlas segmentations to iteratively mask tissues outside of the region of interest to improve the atlas alignment and subsequent segmentation.  Methods:   An improved atlas registration scheme is proposed. Starting from a suitable initial alignment, the alignment is refined by introducing additional stages of deformable registration during which the image sampling is limited to the dilated atlas segmentation label mask. The performance of the method was demonstrated using leave-one-out cross-validation using atlases of 10 whole-body 3D-T1 images of prostate cancer patients with bone metastases and healthy male volunteers, and compared to existing state of the art. Both registration accuracy and resulting segmentation quality, using four commonly used label fusion strategies, were evaluated.  Results:   The proposed method showed significant improvement in registration and segmentation accuracy with respect to the state of the art for all validation criteria and label fusion strategies, resulting in a Dice coefficient of 0.887 (STEPS label fusion). The average Dice coefficient for the multi-atlas segmentation showed over 11% improvement with a decrease of false positive rate from 28.3% to 13.2%. For this application, repeated application of the background masking did not lead to significant improvement of the segmentation result.  Conclusions:   A registration strategy, relying on the use of atlas segmentations as mask during image registration was proposed and evaluated for multi-atlas segmentation of whole-body MRI. The approach significantly improved registration and final segmentation accuracy and may be applicable to other structures of interest.""","""['Jakub Ceranka', 'Sabrina Verga', 'Maryna Kvasnytsia', 'Frédéric Lecouvet', 'Nicolas Michoux', 'Johan de Mey', 'Hubert Raeymaekers', 'Thierry Metens', 'Julie Absil', 'Jef Vandemeulebroucke']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Magn Reson Med""","""['Multi-atlas segmentation of the whole hippocampus and subfields using multiple automatically generated templates.', 'Comparison of atlas-based techniques for whole-body bone segmentation.', 'Volume measurements of individual muscles in human quadriceps femoris using atlas-based segmentation approaches.', 'One registration multi-atlas-based pseudo-CT generation for attenuation correction in PET/MRI.', 'Multi-atlas image registration of clinical data with automated quality assessment using ventricle segmentation.', 'Automated Motion Analysis of Bony Joint Structures from Dynamic Computer Tomography Images: A Multi-Atlas Approach.', 'Whole-body magnetic resonance imaging: technique, guidelines and key applications.', 'To Align Multimodal Lumbar Spine Images via Bending Energy Constrained Normalized Mutual Information.']"""

We studied testicular cancer patients' objective and subjective cognitive function longitudinally, comparing a surgery group with a surgery + chemotherapy group, addressing prior methodological issues using a computerized test to limit assessment issues, and controlling for confounding variables.  Methods:   Prospectively, of 145 patients from 16 centres with sufficient data, n = 61 receiving surgery + chemotherapy (etoposide and cisplatin ± bleomycin, BEP/EP; or single agent carboplatin) were compared to n = 41 receiving surgery alone. CogHealth assessed six objective cognitive tasks. The Cognitive Failures Questionnaire assessed self-perceived cognitive dysfunction. The Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale assessed psychological influences. Linear mixed models compared changes from baseline (< 6 months post-surgery/pre-chemotherapy) to follow-up (12-18 months post-baseline), controlling covariates.  Results:   There were no significant interaction effects for five objective cognitive function tasks suggesting that changes over time were not due to group membership. However, psychomotor function (controlling for age) and physical well-being were significantly worse for the chemotherapy versus the surgery group at baseline, with groups converging by follow-up. Groups showed no differences in subjective cognitive dysfunction. The chemotherapy group showed higher anxiety, poorer functional well-being and worse fatigue compared to the surgery-only group at baseline, but not by follow-up. For both groups, emotional well-being, functional well-being and anxiety significantly improved over time.  Conclusion:   No substantive differences in objective or subjective cognitive dysfunction in either group persisted 12-18 months post-baseline.

Surgical therapy with a urethral sling or an artificial urinary sphincter is an effective option with high patient satisfaction in men in whom conservative measures fail to treat post-prostatectomy incontinence. We sought to characterize the contemporary utilization of surgical therapy of post-prostatectomy incontinence using an all payer database.  Materials and methods:   We used the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project databases for Florida from 2006 to 2015 and identified men who underwent radical prostatectomy between 2006 and 2012 using ICD procedure codes. Patients were tracked longitudinally for placement of an ambulatory or inpatient urethral sling, or an artificial urinary sphincter between 2006 and 2015. Patient and clinical data were extracted and analyzed with descriptive statistics. A multivariable logistic regression model was constructed to determine risk adjusted predictors of subsequent incontinence surgery.  Results:   During the study period 29,287 men underwent radical prostatectomy, of whom 1,068 (3.6%) were treated with subsequent incontinence surgery a median of 23.5 months after prostatectomy. On multivariate analysis risk factors for incontinence surgery included age groups 61 to 70 years (OR 1.25, p=0.008) and 71 to 80 years (OR 1.34, p=0.022), Medicare insurance (OR 1.33, p <0.005) and an increased Charlson Comorbidity Index (OR 1.13 per unit increase, p <0.005).  Conclusions:   Of patients who underwent radical prostatectomy 3.6% subsequently underwent stress urinary incontinence surgery.

This update includes practical recommendations on the use of magnetic resonance imaging for screening, diagnosis, staging, treatment and surveillance of prostate cancer.  Materials and methods:   A panel of clinicians from the American Urological Association and Society of Abdominal Radiology with expertise in the diagnosis and management of prostate cancer evaluated the current published literature on the use and technique of magnetic resonance imaging for this disease. When adequate studies were available for analysis, recommendations were made on the basis of data and when adequate studies were not available, recommendations were made on the basis of expert consensus.  Results:   Prostate magnetic resonance imaging should be performed according to technical specifications and standards, and interpreted according to standard reporting. Data support its use in men with a previous negative biopsy and ongoing concerns about increased risk of prostate cancer. Sufficient data now exist to support the recommendation of magnetic resonance imaging before prostate biopsy in all men who have no history of biopsy. Currently, the evidence is insufficient to recommend magnetic resonance imaging for screening, staging or surveillance of prostate cancer.  Conclusions:   Use of prostate magnetic resonance imaging in the risk stratification, diagnosis and treatment pathway of men with prostate cancer is expanding.

In this study, we performed integrated analysis of a dataset from the Gene Expression Omnibus database to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and differentially expressed miRNAs (DEmiRNAs) between CSCC, cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) and healthy control subjects. We further established protein-protein interaction and DEmiRNA-target gene interaction networks, and performed functional annotation of the target genes of DEmiRNAs. In total, we identified 1375 DEGs and 19 DEmiRNAs in CIN versus normal control, and 2235 DEGs and 33 DEmiRNAs in CSCC versus CIN by integrated analysis. Our protein-protein interaction network indicates that the common DEGs, Cyclin B/cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1), CCND1, ESR1 and Aurora kinase A (AURKA), are the top four hub genes. P53 and prostate cancer were identified as significantly enriched signaling pathways of common DEGs and DEmiRNA targets, respectively. We validated that expression levels of three DEGs (TYMS, SASH1 and CDK1) and one DEmiRNA of hsa-miR-99a were altered in blood samples of patients with CSCC. In conclusion, a total of four DEGs (TYMS, SASH1, CDK1 and AURKA) and two DEmiRNAs (hsa-miR-21 and hsa-miR-99a) may be involved in the pathogenesis of CIN and the progression of CIN into CSCC. Of these, TYMS is predicted to be regulated by hsa-miR-99a and SASH1 to be regulated by hsa-miR-21.""","""['Dan Sun', 'Lu Han', 'Rui Cao', 'Huali Wang', 'Jiyong Jiang', 'Yanjie Deng', 'Xiaohui Yu']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""FEBS Open Bio""","""['A ceRNA network of BBOX1-AS1-hsa-miR-125b-5p/hsa-miR-125a-5p-CDKN2A shows prognostic value in cervical cancer.', 'miRNA and mRNA Integration Network Construction Reveals Novel Key Regulators in Left-Sided and Right-Sided Colon Adenocarcinoma.', 'Identification of novel genes associated with a poor prognosis in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma via a bioinformatics analysis.', 'Meta-analysis of transcriptomics data identifies potential biomarkers and their associated regulatory networks in gallbladder cancer.', ""'Drawing' a Molecular Portrait of CIN and Cervical Cancer: a Review of Genome-Wide Molecular Profiling Data."", 'Metadata analysis to explore hub of the hub-genes highlighting their functions, pathways and regulators for cervical cancer diagnosis and therapies.', 'miR-99a-5p inhibits glycolysis and induces cell apoptosis in cervical cancer by targeting RRAGD.', 'Bioinformatics Screening of Potential Biomarkers from mRNA Expression Profiles to Discover Drug Targets and Agents for Cervical Cancer.']"""

Methods:   Men were recruited through the UK-wide 'Life After Prostate Cancer Diagnosis' (LAPCD) survey. Telephone interviews were conducted with men (n = 14) with BA and BC backgrounds between 18 and 42 months post-diagnosis. Data were analysed using a Framework approach.  Results:   Most men (n = 12) were born outside the UK, were married (n = 9) and employed (n = 9). Median age was 66 years (range: 55-85). Six overarching themes emerged: a strong reliance upon faith beliefs; maintaining a 'positive' front; work as distraction; non-disclosure of diagnosis even amongst family members, influenced by stigma and masculinity concerns; active awareness-raising amongst a minority and support-seeking from close community. A few men emphasised a need to 'pitch' awareness-raising messages appropriately. Potential links existed between faith beliefs, presenting a positive front, community support-seeking and local awareness-raising.  Conclusion:   The provision of patient-centred care requires cultural sensitivity. Interventions that challenge stigma and men's reluctance to disclose problems associated with PCa and treatment may encourage help-seeking for symptom support.

In this study, proteomics and metabolomics were integrated to study the effects of SPOP mutation on metabolism. First, LNCaP control (CON), SPOP wild-type (SPOP_WT), and SPOP mutation (SPOP_Y87N and SPOP_F133L) cells were subjected to a metabolomics study. The metabolomics data of LNCaP CON, SPOP_WT, SPOP_Y87N, and SPOP_F133L cells were evaluated by partial least squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA). Four groups could be clearly differentiated with an explanation ability of R2X=0.512, R2Y=0.616 and predictive ability of Q2=0.475. Totally, 36 differential metabolites were defined with variable importance for the projection (VIP) value > 1. Then, the 36 metabolites were subjected to one-way ANOVA analysis. Fumaric acid, malic acid, citric acid, aspartic acid, and asparagine were increased in LNCaP SPOP mutation cells compared to that in LNCaP SPOP_WT cells. Using a proteomics study, 909 differential proteins were found in LNCaP SPOP_Y87N and SPOP_F133L cells. MetaboAnalyst 3.0 was used to enrich metabolic pathways by using differential metabolites. KOBAS 3.0 was used to enrich metabolic pathways by using differential proteins. Both metabolomics and proteomics analysis showed that the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis were significantly changed. To validate these findings, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS)-based metabolomics was performed in Du145 SPOP knock-out cells. The results indicated that the TCA cycle was activated in Du145 SPOP knock-out cells.

Methods:   Urologists and clinical oncologists practicing in Hong Kong were invited to complete a survey based on the original APCCC 2017 questionnaire and recently published trials in APC. A joint committee of expert key opinion leaders was convened to discuss and analyze the voting differences between local specialists and the APCCC 2017 panel.

Methods:   From the HealthCore Integrated Research Database (HIRD), we selected men ages 30 years or greater who were new users of TT during 2007 to 2015. We selected two comparison groups: (i) unexposed (matched 10:1) and (ii) new users of phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor (PDE5i). Incident prostate cancer was defined as diagnosis of prostate cancer within 4 weeks following prostate biopsy. Propensity scores and inverse probability of treatment weights were used in Poisson regression models to estimate adjusted incidence rates, incidence rate ratios (IRR), and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Subgroup analyses included stratification by prostate cancer screening, hypogonadism, and follow-up time.  Results:   The adjusted prostate cancer IRR was 0.77 (95% CI, 0.68-0.86) when comparing TT with the unexposed group and 0.85 (95% CI, 0.79-0.91) in comparison with the PDE5i group. Inverse associations between TT and prostate cancer were observed in a majority of subgroup analyses, although in both comparisons estimates generally attenuated with increasing time following initial exposure. Among TT users, duration of exposure was not associated with prostate cancer.  Conclusions:   Men who received TT did not have a higher rate of prostate cancer compared with the unexposed or PDE5i comparison groups. The inverse association between TT and prostate cancer could be the result of residual confounding, contraindication bias, or undefined biological effect.

Objective:   To determine the clinical course of patients with CDK12 mutant advanced prostate cancer compared with other genomic subtypes.  Design, setting, and participants:   A retrospective analysis of data from three academic medical centers, including 317 patients with advanced prostate cancer and prior next-generation sequencing from tumor tissue (n = 172) or circulating tumor DNA (n = 145), was performed. Forty-six patients had CDK12 mutations; 34 had biallelic CDK12 loss (79%).  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Patients were stratified by mutation status (CDK12, homologous recombination deficiency [HRD; BRCA1/2 and ATM], TP53, and other cohort). The Kaplan-Meier method was used to evaluate time to event outcomes: time to development of metastatic disease, time to development of castration resistance, and time to prostate-specific antigen (PSA) progression after first-line androgen receptor pathway inhibitor (ARPI) therapy in a patient subset.  Results and limitations:   The median follow-up was 66.6 mo. Patients with CDK12 mutant prostate cancer exhibited shorter time to metastasis (median = 34.9 mo, p = 0.004) and development of castration-resistant disease (median = 32.7 mo, p < 0.001), compared with other genomic subtypes, with shorter time to PSA progression on first-line ARPI treatment of metastatic castration-resistant disease (median = 3.6 mo, p = 0.0219). CDK12 mutant patients did not have overall shorter time on treatment compared with other mutation subgroups, and CDK12 status did not demonstrate statistical significance in multivariate analysis. Limitations include variable center-dependent practice patterns and heterogeneity due to combining tumor and liquid biopsy data.  Conclusions:   Our data suggest that advanced prostate cancers harboring CDK12 mutations display aggressive clinical behavior, underscoring the need to fully delineate the molecular and clinical characteristics, and appropriate therapeutic approaches for distinct subtypes of advanced prostate cancers.  Patient summary:   In this report, we evaluate the clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients with prostate cancer and CDK12 mutation in their tumors.

Thus, to improve the management of PC, novel biomarkers are urgently needed.  Results:   In this study, we integrated genome-wide methylome (Illumina 450K DNA methylation array (450K)) and RNA sequencing (RNAseq) data performed in a discovery set of 27 PC and 15 adjacent normal (AN) prostate tissue samples to identify candidate driver genes involved in PC development and/or progression. We found significant enrichment for homeobox genes among the most aberrantly methylated and transcriptionally dysregulated genes in PC. Specifically, homeobox gene MEIS2 (Myeloid Ecotropic viral Insertion Site 2) was significantly hypermethylated (p < 0.0001, Mann-Whitney test) and transcriptionally downregulated (p < 0.0001, Mann-Whitney test) in PC compared to non-malignant prostate tissue in our discovery sample set, which was also confirmed in an independent validation set including > 500 PC and AN tissue samples in total (TCGA cohort analyzed by 450K and RNAseq). Furthermore, in three independent radical prostatectomy (RP) cohorts (n > 700 patients in total), low MEIS2 transcriptional expression was significantly associated with poor biochemical recurrence (BCR) free survival (p = 0.0084, 0.0001, and 0.0191, respectively; log-rank test). Next, we analyzed another RP cohort consisting of > 200 PC, AN, and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) samples by quantitative methylation-specific PCR (qMSP) and found that MEIS2 was significantly hypermethylated (p < 0.0001, Mann-Whitney test) in PC compared to non-malignant prostate tissue samples (AN and BPH) with an AUC > 0.84. Moreover, in this cohort, aberrant MEIS2 hypermethylation was significantly associated with post-operative BCR (p = 0.0068, log-rank test), which was subsequently confirmed (p = 0.0067; log-rank test) in the independent TCGA validation cohort (497 RP patients; 450K data).

Overtreatment of indolent PCa cases, which likely do not progress to aggressive stages, may be associated with severe side effects and considerable costs. These could be avoided by utilizing robust prognostic markers to guide treatment decisions.  Results:   We present a random forest-based classification model to predict aggressive behaviour of prostate cancer. DNA methylation changes between PCa cases with good or poor prognosis (discovery cohort with n = 70) were used as input. DNA was extracted from formalin-fixed tumour tissue, and genome-wide DNA methylation differences between both groups were assessed using Illumina HumanMethylation450 arrays. For the random forest-based modelling, the discovery cohort was randomly split into a training (80%) and a test set (20%). Our methylation-based classifier demonstrated excellent performance in discriminating prognosis subgroups in the test set (Kaplan-Meier survival analyses with log-rank p value < 0.0001). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) for the sensitivity analysis was 95%. Using the ICGC cohort of early- and late-onset prostate cancer (n = 222) and the TCGA PRAD cohort (n = 477) for external validation, AUCs for sensitivity analyses were 77.1% and 68.7%, respectively. Cancer progression-related DNA hypomethylation was frequently located in 'partially methylated domains' (PMDs)-large-scale genomic areas with progressive loss of DNA methylation linked to mitotic cell division. We selected several candidate genes with differential methylation in gene promoter regions for additional validation at the protein expression level by immunohistochemistry in > 12,000 tissue micro-arrayed PCa cases. Loss of ZIC2 protein expression was associated with poor prognosis and correlated with significantly shorter time to biochemical recurrence. The prognostic value of ZIC2 proved to be independent from established clinicopathological variables including Gleason grade, tumour stage, nodal stage and prostate-specific-antigen.  Conclusions:   Our results highlight the prognostic relevance of methylation loss in PMD regions, as well as of several candidate genes not previously associated with PCa progression. Our robust and externally validated PCa classification model either directly or via protein expression analyses of the identified top-ranked candidate genes will support the clinical management of prostate cancer.""","""['Reka Toth', 'Heiko Schiffmann', 'Claudia Hube-Magg', 'Franziska Büscheck', 'Doris Höflmayer', 'Sören Weidemann', 'Patrick Lebok', 'Christoph Fraune', 'Sarah Minner', 'Thorsten Schlomm', 'Guido Sauter', 'Christoph Plass', 'Yassen Assenov', 'Ronald Simon', 'Jan Meiners', 'Clarissa Gerhäuser']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Clin Epigenetics""","""['Epigenetic silencing of MEIS2 in prostate cancer recurrence.', 'RHCG and TCAF1 promoter hypermethylation predicts biochemical recurrence in prostate cancer patients treated by radical prostatectomy.', 'Exploring targets of TET2-mediated methylation reprogramming as potential discriminators of prostate cancer progression.', 'DNA methylation changes in prostate cancer: current developments and future clinical implementation.', 'Prognostic DNA methylation markers for prostate cancer.', 'Graph Random Forest: A Graph Embedded Algorithm for Identifying Highly Connected Important Features.', 'A single nuclei atlas of aging human abdominal subcutaneous white adipose tissue.', 'The immunogenic radiation and new players in immunotherapy and targeted therapy for head and neck cancer.', 'Renal interferon-inducible protein 16 expression is associated with disease activity and prognosis in lupus nephritis.', 'Comprehensive Analysis of m7G-Related Genes and Chronic Hepatitis B: Diagnostic Markers, Immune Microenvironment Regulation, Disease Progression.']"""

In this study, we evaluate the potential of prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) as target for radio-ligand therapy (RLT).  Methods:   Tube formation was investigated after incubation of endothelial HUVEC cells in tumor-conditioned media and monitored after staining using microscopy. A binding study with 68Ga-labeled PSMA-addressing ligand was used to indicate targeting potential of PSMA on tumor-conditioned HUVEC cells. For mimicking of the therapeutic application, tube formation potential and vitality of tumor-conditioned HUVEC cells were assessed following an incubation with radiolabeled PSMA-addressing ligand [177Lu]-PSMA-617. For in vivo experiments, NUDE mice were xenografted with triple-negative breast cancer cells MDA-MB231 or estrogen receptor expressing breast cancer cells MCF-7. Biodistribution and binding behavior of [68Ga]-PSMA-11 was investigated in both tumor models at 30 min post injection using μPET. PSMA- and CD31-specific staining was conducted to visualize PSMA expression and neovascularization in tumor tissue ex vivo.  Results:   The triple-negative breast cancer cells MDA-MB231 showed a high pro-angiogenetic potential on tube formation of endothelial HUVEC cells. The induced endothelial expression of PSMA was efficiently addressed by radiolabeled PSMA-specific ligands. 177Lu-labeled PSMA-617 strongly impaired the vitality and angiogenic potential of HUVEC cells. In vivo, as visualized by μPET, radiolabeled PSMA-ligand accumulated specifically in the triple-negative breast cancer xenograft MDA-MB231 (T/B ratio of 43.3 ± 0.9), while no [68Ga]-PSMA-11 was detected in the estrogen-sensitive MCF-7 xenograft (T/B ratio of 1.1 ± 0.1). An ex vivo immunofluorescence analysis confirmed the localization of PSMA on MDA-MB231 xenograft-associated endothelial cells and also on TNBC cells.

Cancer can be a cause or an effect of CKD. In CKD patients, a better understanding of cancer distribution and associations can aid in the proper planning of renal replacement therapy (RRT) and in the choice of chemotherapeutic agents, many of which are precluded in more advanced CKD. This study aims to investigate the distribution and the association of cancer with mortality, renal progression and RRT assignment in a non-dialysis dependent CKD cohort, few studies have investigated this in the past.  Methods:   The study was carried out on 2952 patients registered in the Salford Kidney Study (SKS) between October 2002 and December 2016. A comparative analysis was performed between 339 patients with a history of cancer (previous and current) and 2613 patients without cancer at recruitment. A propensity score matched cohort of 337 patients was derived from each group and used for analysis. Cox-regression models and Kaplan-Meier estimates were used to compare the association of cancer with mortality and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) outcomes. Linear regression analysis was applied to generate the annual rate of decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate (delta eGFR).  Results:   Of our cohort, 13.3% had a history of cancer at recruitment and the annual rate of de novo cancers in the non-cancer patients was 1.6%. Urogenital cancers including kidney and bladder, and prostate and testicle in males, ovary and uterus in females, were the most prevalent cancers (46%), as expected from the anatomical or physiological roles of these organs and relationship to nephrology. Over a median follow-up of 48 months, 1084 (36.7%) of patients died. All-cause mortality was higher in the previous and current cancer group (49.6% vs 35%, p < 0.001), primarily because of cancer-specific mortality. Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed a strong association of cancer with all-cause mortality (HR:1.41; 95%CI: 1.12-1.78; p = 0.004). There was no difference between the groups regarding reaching end-stage renal disease (26% in both groups) or the rate of decline in eGFR (- 0.97 for cancer vs - 0.93 mL/min/year for non-cancer, p = 0.93). RRT uptake was similar between the groups (17.2% vs 19.3%, p = 0.49).  Conclusions:   Cancer status proved to be an added burden and an independent risk factor for all-cause mortality but not for renal progression. CKD patients with a previous or current history of cancer should be assessed on a case by case basis in planning for renal replacement therapy options, and the presence of cancer should not be a limitation for RRT provision including transplantation.""","""['Rajkumar Chinnadurai', 'Emma Flanagan', 'Gordon C Jayson', 'Philip A Kalra']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""BMC Nephrol""","""['Associations of urological malignancies with renal progression and mortality in advanced chronic kidney disease: a propensity-matched cohort study.', 'Distribution and association of cancer with mortality in end-stage renal disease patients receiving dialysis.', 'Progression and outcomes of non-dialysis dependent chronic kidney disease patients: A single center longitudinal follow-up study.', 'Early referral strategies for management of people with markers of renal disease: a systematic review of the evidence of clinical effectiveness, cost-effectiveness and economic analysis.', 'GFR at initiation of dialysis and mortality in CKD: a meta-analysis.', 'Chronic Kidney Disease and Cancer: Inter-Relationships and Mechanisms.', 'Association between chronic kidney disease and cancer including the mortality of cancer patients: national health and nutrition examination survey 1999-2014.']"""

In this study, we evaluated mutant 4D4 (L3-2) antibody-assisted assay constructs against reference wild-type (wt)-4D4-based assays for determination of intact PSA (iPSA) and nicked PSA (nPSA) in plasma samples.  Methods:   Perioperative plasma samples obtained from 105 men who underwent biopsy (73 cancer, 32 noncancer) were analyzed with sandwich immunoassays for total PSA (tPSA), free PSA (fPSA), iPSA (3 constructs), and measured nPSA (2 constructs). Calculated nPSA (CN) was obtained from total fPSA - iPSA.  Results:   Mutant-assisted iPSA assays measured lower concentrations than the reference in both patient groups. CN separated the 2 groups with the iPSA using the mutant for capture (I-MC) performing the best (P = 0.008). In prostate volume group > median, only measured nPSA provided significant discrimination [area under the curve (AUC), 0.71; P = 0.016] but equally using mutant and wt antibodies. In the whole cohort, all ratios to tPSA performed well (AUC, 0.819-0.870; P ≤ 0.0001) with CN based on I-MC scoring highest (AUC, 0.870). Importantly, in the ≤ median volume group, the I-MC/F and CN(I-MC)/T ratios stand out as the best performing parameters (AUC, 0.825 and 0.861; P = 0.001 and P = 0.0003, respectively).  Conclusions:   The new assay construct using the mutant 4D4 (L3-2) as a capture provides clear improvement in separating cancer from noncancer in all subgroups analyzed but especially in patients with prostate volume ≤ median.Clinical Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier NCT01864135.""","""['Md Ferdhos L Khan', 'Minna Soikkeli', 'Erica Routila', 'Sandra Krannila', 'Joonas Terävä', 'Pekka Taimen', 'Peter J Boström', 'Kim Pettersson']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""J Appl Lab Med""","""['Phage display aided improvement of a unique prostate-specific antigen (PSA) antibody unreactive with Lys(145)-Lys(146) internally cleaved forms.', 'Discrimination of benign from malignant prostatic disease by selective measurements of single chain, intact free prostate specific antigen.', 'Discrimination of prostate cancer from benign disease by plasma measurement of intact, free prostate-specific antigen lacking an internal cleavage site at Lys145-Lys146.', 'Screening for prostate cancer in 2008 II: the importance of molecular subforms of prostate-specific antigen and tissue kallikreins.', 'Molecular forms of prostate-specific antigen and human kallikrein 2 as promising tools for early diagnosis of prostate cancer.']"""

Associations of body mass index (BMI) and race with incident prostate cancer were compared for observed versus imputation-enhanced outcomes using incident density ratios.  Results:   Accounting for differential biopsy assessment, the previously reported positive linear trend between BMI and prostate cancer in African American men was not observed; no BMI association was found among Non-Hispanic White men.  Conclusions:   Differential disease classification among men who may be recommended to undergo and then consider whether to accept a prostate biopsy leads to inaccurate identification of prostate cancer risk factors.

Because of the rarity of downstream events, data from existing AS cohorts cannot yet address how differences in surveillance intensity affect metastasis and mortality. This study projected the comparative benefits of different AS schedules in men diagnosed with prostate cancer who had Gleason score (GS) ≤6 disease and risk profiles similar to those in North American AS cohorts.  Methods:   Times of GS upgrading were simulated based on AS data from the University of Toronto, Johns Hopkins University, the University of California at San Francisco, and the Canary Pass Active Surveillance Cohort. Times to metastasis and prostate cancer death, informed by models from the Scandinavian Prostate Cancer Group 4 trial, were projected under biopsy surveillance schedules ranging from watchful waiting to annual biopsies. Outcomes included the risk of metastasis, the risk of death, remaining life-years (LYs), and quality-adjusted LYs.  Results:   Compared with watchful waiting, AS biopsies reduced the risk of prostate cancer metastasis and prostate cancer death at 20 years by 1.4% to 3.3% and 1.0% to 2.4%, respectively; and 5-year biopsies reduced the risk of metastasis and prostate cancer death by 1.0% to 2.4% and 0.6% to 1.6%, respectively. There was little difference between annual and 5-year biopsy schedules in terms of LYs (range of differences, 0.04-0.16 LYs) and quality-adjusted LYs (range of differences, -0.02 to 0.09 quality-adjusted LYs).

When first line therapies show initial success, around 50% of cancers relapse and proceed to metastasis. In this study we assessed the Protein inhibitor of activated signal transducers and activators of transcription (PIAS)1 as a potential therapeutic target in urothelial cancer. PIAS1 is a key regulator of STAT1 signalling and may be implicated in carcinogenesis. In contrast to other cancer types PIAS1 protein expression is not significantly different in malignant areas of UC specimens compared to non-malignant tissue. In addition, we found that down-regulation and overexpression of PIAS1 had no effect on the viability or colony forming ability of tested cell lines. Whilst other studies of PIAS1 suggest an important biological role in cancer, this study shows that PIAS1 has no influence on reducing the cytotoxic effects of Cisplatin or cell recovery after DNA damage induced by irradiation. Taken together, these in vitro data demonstrate that PIAS1 is not a promising therapeutic target in UC cancer as previously shown in different entities such as prostate cancer (PCa).""","""['Holger Hans Hermann Erb', 'Marlies Ebert', 'Ronja Kuhn', 'Lukas Donix', 'Axel Haferkamp', 'Robert Ian Seed', 'Eva Jüngel']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['PIAS1 is increased in human prostate cancer and enhances proliferation through inhibition of p21.', 'Protein inhibitor of activated STAT-1 is downregulated in gastric cancer tissue and involved in cell metastasis.', 'miR-182-5p and miR-96-5p Target PIAS1 and Mediate the Negative Feedback Regulatory Loop between PIAS1 and STAT3 in Endometrial Cancer.', 'The transcriptional activity of co-activator AIB1 is regulated by the SUMO E3 ligase PIAS1.', 'PIAS1 binds p300 and behaves as a coactivator or corepressor of the transcription factor c-Myb dependent on SUMO-status.']"""

TMPRSS2-ERG fusions have been shown to regulate AR signaling, interfere with pro-differentiation functions, and mediate oncogenic signaling. We have recently shown that ERG regulates intra-tumoral androgen synthesis and thereby facilitates AR function in prostate cancer cells. We hypothesize that enzalutamide treatment will be more effective in cells/tumors with TMPRSS2-ERG translocations because these tumors have increased AR signaling.  Methods:   ERG knockdown was performed with VCaP cells using lentiviral infections to generate VCaP ERGshRNA cells and control VCaP scr cells with scrambled shRNA. Cell-growth analysis was performed to determine the effect of enzalutamide. Reverse transcription, quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR) was used to determine the expression of AR responsive genes. Luciferase tagged VCaP scr and shRNA infected cells were used in an intra-tibial animal model for bone tumor growth analysis and enzalutamide treatment used to inhibit AR signaling in bone tumors. Western blotting analyzed VCaP bone tumor samples for ERG, AR, AKR1C3 and HSD3B1 and HSD3B2 expression.  Results:   Enzalutamide inhibited the growth of VCaP scr cells more effectively than shERG cells. Analysis of AR responsive genes shows that Enzalutamide treatment at 5 micromolar concentration inhibited by 85-90% in VCaP Scr cells whereas these genes were inhibited to a lesser extent in VCaP shERG cells. Enzalutamide treatment resulted in severe growth inhibition in VCaP scr shRNA cells compared to VCaP shERG cells. In bone tumor growth experiment, VCaP ERG shRNA cells grew at slower than VCaP scr shRNA cells. Androgen biosynthetic enzyme expression is lower VCaP shERG bone tumors compared to VCaP scr shRNA bone tumors and enzalutamide inhibited the enzyme expression in both types of tumors.  Conclusions:   These data suggest that ERG transcription factor regulates androgen biosynthetic enzyme expression that enzalutamide treatment is more effective against VCaP bone tumors with an intact ERG expression, and that knocking down ERG in VCaP cells leads to a lesser response to enzalutamide therapy. Thus, ERG expression status in tumors could help stratify patients for enzalutamide therapy.""","""['Louie Semaan', 'Navneet Mander', 'Michael L Cher', 'Sreenivasa R Chinni']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""BMC Cancer""","""['ERG/AKR1C3/AR Constitutes a Feed-Forward Loop for AR Signaling in Prostate Cancer Cells.', 'The influence of treatment sequence in the prognostic value of TMPRSS2-ERG as biomarker of taxane resistance in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Nuclear receptor ERRα and transcription factor ERG form a reciprocal loop in the regulation of TMPRSS2:ERG fusion gene in prostate cancer.', 'Enzalutamide: targeting the androgen signalling pathway in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Second-Generation Androgen Receptor Antagonists as Hormonal Therapeutics for Three Forms of Prostate Cancer.', 'Complexities of Prostate Cancer.', 'To bind or not to bind: Cistromic reprogramming in prostate cancer.', 'P1245 Polymorphic Variants of HSD3B1 Gene Confer Different Outcome in Specific Subgroups of Patients Infected With SARS-CoV-2.', 'Single-cell gene fusion detection by scFusion.', 'Updates on Molecular and Biochemical Development and Progression of Prostate Cancer.']"""

They are capable of extracellular matrix (ECM) degradation, which is a prerequisite for cancer cell invasion and metastasis. The signaling mechanism of podosome formation is still unknown in cancer. We previously reported that Nck adaptors regulate directional cell migration and endothelial lumen formation by actin remodeling, while deficiency of Nck reduces cancer metastasis. This study evaluated the role of Nck adaptors in podosome biogenesis and cancer invasion.  Methods:   This study was conducted in vitro using both healthy cells (Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cell, 3T3 fibroblasts) and cancer cells (prostate cancer cell line; PC3, breast cancer cell line; MDA-MB-231). Confocal and TIRF imaging of cells expressing Green Fluorescence Protein (GFP) mutant under altered levels of Nck or downstream of kinase 1 (Dok1) was used to evaluate the podosome formation and fluorescent gelatin matrix degradation. Levels of Nck in human breast carcinoma tissue sections were detected by immune histochemistry using Nck polyclonal antibody. Biochemical interaction of Nck/Dok1 was detected in podosome forming cells using immune precipitation and far-western blotting.  Results:   This study demonstrates that ectopic expression of Nck1 and Nck2 can induce the endothelial podosome formation in vitro. Nck silencing by short-hairpin RNA blocked podosome biogenesis and ECM degradation in cSrc-Y530F transformed endothelial cells in this study. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed the Nck overexpression in human breast carcinoma tissue sections. Immunoprecipitation and far-western blotting revealed the biochemical interaction of Nck/p62Dok in podosome forming cells.

Patients and methods:   The TheraP trial (ANZUP 1603) is an open-label, randomized, stratified, two-arm multicentre phase 2 trial comparing the activity and safety of cabazitaxel chemotherapy vs 177 Lu-PSMA-617 therapy in the treatment of men with mCRPC. Key eligibility criteria include prior docetaxel chemotherapy, rising prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level, sufficient PSMA avidity, as defined by centrally reviewed 68 Ga-PSMA-11 and fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) with no discordant FDG-avid PSMA-negative sites of disease. Patients in the control group receive standard treatment with cabazitaxel (20 mg/m2 ) i.v. every 3 weeks with prednisolone 10 mg daily orally, for a maximum of 10 cycles. Patients in the experimental group receive 177 Lu-PSMA-617 (8.5 GBq decreasing by 0.5 GBq per cycle) i.v. every 6 weeks, for up to a maximum of six cycles. In the event of an exceptional response as defined on centrally reviewed post-therapy single-photon emission CT imaging, treatment will be suspended but can recommence on progression. The trial aims to include 200 patients who will be centrally randomized to one of the two treatment groups, in a 1:1 ratio. The primary endpoint is PSA response. Secondary endpoints are overall survival, progression-free survival (PFS), radiographic PFS, PSA PFS, objective tumour response, pain response, pain PFS, health-related quality of life, and frequency and severity of adverse events.

However, the role of lncRNA‑mediated ceRNAs in breast cancer (BC) remains unclear. In the present study, a ceRNA network was generated to explore their role in BC. The expression profiles of mRNAs, miRNAs and lncRNAs in 1,109 BC tissues and 113 normal breast tissues were obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas database (TCGA). A total of 3,198 differentially expressed (DE) mRNAs, 150 differentially DEmiRNAs and 1,043 DElncRNAs were identified between BC and normal tissues. A lncRNA‑miRNA‑mRNA network associated with BC was successfully constructed based on the combined data obtained from RNA databases, and comprised 97 lncRNA nodes, 24 miRNA nodes and 74 mRNA nodes. The biological functions of the 74 DEmRNAs were further investigated by Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis. The results demonstrated that the DEmRNAs were significantly enriched in two GO biological process categories; the main biological process enriched term was 'positive regulation of GTPase activity'. By KEGG analysis, four key enriched pathways were obtained, including the 'MAPK signaling pathway', the 'Ras signaling pathway', 'prostate cancer', and the 'FoxO signaling pathway'. Kaplan‑Meier survival analysis revealed that six DElncRNAs (INC AC112721.1, LINC00536, MIR7‑3HG, ADAMTS9‑AS1, AL356479.1 and LINC00466), nine DEmRNAs (KPNA2, RACGAP1, SHCBP1, ZNF367, NTRK2, ORS1, PTGS2, RASGRP1 and SFRP1) and two DEmiRNAs (hsa‑miR‑301b and hsa‑miR‑204) had significant effects on overall survival in BC.

Induced overexpression of GHSROS in the MDA‑MB‑231 breast cancer cell line significantly increased cell migration in vitro, without affecting cell proliferation, a finding similar to our previous study on lung cancer cell lines. Microarray analysis revealed a significant repression of a small cluster of major histocompatibility class II genes and enrichment of immune response pathways; this phenomenon may allow tumour cells to better evade the immune system. Ectopic overexpression of GHSROS in the MDA‑MB‑231 cell line significantly increased orthotopic xenograft growth in mice, suggesting that in vitro culture does not fully capture the function of this lncRNA.

Methods:   Included were 1263 men aged ≥ 40 years who participated in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey in 2009-2010. Measurements of periodontal health and tooth count were used to define periodontal disease severity (no, mild, moderate, severe) and edentulism.

Results:   Adjusting for age and other factors including race, body mass index, and education, the natural logarithm of PSA concentration did not change with increasing severity (mild - 0.20, 95% confidence interval [CI] - 0.34 to - 0.05; moderate - 0.12, 95% CI - 0.26 to 0.01; severe - 0.16, 95% CI - 0.43 to 0.12; edentulism - 0.16, 95% CI - 0.35 to 0.04; P-trend 0.13) compared with dentate men without periodontal disease.

Similar non-significant associations with PSA were observed when comparing edentulous men to dentate men without periodontal disease.  Conclusions:   In this US nationally representative sample, men with periodontal disease did not have higher serum PSA and were not more likely to have clinically elevated PSA after taking into account age and other factors, contrary to the hypothesis.

Overexpression of enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2), the major histone H3 lysine 27 methyltransferase, has been connected to prostate cancer malignancy. However, its downstream genes and pathways have not been well established. Here, we show tumor suppressor Hepatocyte Nuclear Factor 1β (HNF1B) as a direct downstream target of EZH2. EZH2 binds HNF1B locus and suppresses HNF1B expression in prostate cancer cell lines, which is further supported by the reverse correlation between EZH2 and HNF1B expression in clinical samples. Consistently, restored HNF1B expression significantly suppresses EZH2-mediated overgrowth and EMT processes, including migration and invasion of prostate cancer cell lines. Mechanistically, we find that HNF1B primarily binds the promoters of thousands of target genes, and differentially regulates the expression of 876 genes. We also identify RBBP7/RbAP46 as a HNF1B interacting protein which is required for HNF1B-mediated repression of SLUG expression and EMT process. Importantly, we find that higher HNF1B expression strongly predicts better prognosis of prostate cancer, alone or together with lower EZH2 expression. Taken together, we have established a previously underappreciated axis of EZH2-HNF1B-SLUG in prostate cancer, and also provide evidence supporting HNF1B as a potential prognosis marker for metastatic prostate cancer.""","""['Jianqing Wang#', 'Chenxi He#', 'Peng Gao#', 'Siqing Wang', 'Ruitu Lv', 'Huihui Zhou', 'Qidong Zhou', 'Ke Zhang', 'Jian Sun', 'Caibin Fan', 'Guanxiong Ding', 'Fei Lan']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Oncogene""","""['HNF1B inhibits cell proliferation via repression of SMAD6 expression in prostate cancer.', 'HNF1B, EZH2 and ECI2 in prostate carcinoma.

GNA13 is up-regulated in many solid tumors, including prostate cancer, where it contributes to tumor initiation, drug resistance, and metastasis. To better understand how GNA13 contributes to tumorigenesis and tumor progression, we compared the entire transcriptome of PC3 prostate cancer cells with those cells in which GNA13 expression had been silenced. This analysis revealed that GNA13 levels affected multiple CXC-family chemokines. Further investigation in three different prostate cancer cell lines singled out pro-tumorigenic CXC motif chemokine ligand 5 (CXCL5) as a target of GNA13 signaling. Elevation of GNA13 levels consistently induced CXCL5 RNA and protein expression in all three cell lines. Analysis of the CXCL5 promoter revealed that the -505/+62 region was both highly active and influenced by GNA13, and a single NF-κB site within this region of the promoter was critical for GNA13-dependent promoter activity. ChIP experiments revealed that, upon induction of GNA13 expression, occupancy at the CXCL5 promoter was significantly enriched for the p65 component of NF-κB. GNA13 knockdown suppressed both p65 phosphorylation and the activity of a specific NF-κB reporter, and p65 silencing impaired the GNA13-enhanced expression of CXCL5. Finally, blockade of Rho GTPase activity eliminated the impact of GNA13 on NF-κB transcriptional activity and CXCL5 expression. Together, these findings suggest that GNA13 drives CXCL5 expression by transactivating NF-κB in a Rho-dependent manner in prostate cancer cells.""","""['Wei Kiang Lim', 'Xiaoran Chai', 'Sujoy Ghosh', 'Debleena Ray', 'Mei Wang', 'Suhail Ahmed Kabeer Rasheed', 'Patrick J Casey']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""J Biol Chem""","""['Re: Gα-13 Induces C X C Motif Chemokine Ligand 5 Expression in Prostate Cancer Cells by Transactivating NF-κB.', 'GNA13 promotes tumor growth and angiogenesis by upregulating CXC chemokines via the NF-κB signaling pathway in colorectal cancer cells.', 'MicroRNA-182 and microRNA-200a control G-protein subunit α-13 (GNA13) expression and cell invasion synergistically in prostate cancer cells.', 'The GNA13-RhoA signaling axis suppresses expression of tumor protective Kallikreins.', 'The emerging roles of Gα12/13 proteins on the hallmarks of cancer in solid tumors.', 'Chemokines and chemokine receptors as promoters of prostate cancer growth and progression.', 'The role of CXCL family members in different diseases.', 'The Role of CXC Chemokines in Cancer Progression.', 'Thwarting of Lphn3 Functions in Cell Motility and Signaling by Cancer-Related GAIN Domain Somatic Mutations.', 'Gα12 and Gα13: Versatility in Physiology and Pathology.', 'Chemokines and cytokines: Axis and allies in prostate cancer pathogenesis.']"""

To evaluate the impact of the position, thickness, and deformation of the rectum on the dose distribution in prostate intensity-modulated radiotherapy plans, probability density functions (pdf) of the deformation of rectal cross-section (DW), rectal dose distribution (RM), and changes in rectal wall thickness (TW) were used in the planning optimization.  Materials and methods:   The problem of approximating the product of a number of Gaussian mixture distributions arises in the number of parameters describing the specific mean value, standard deviation, and weight in every Gaussian. In this work, a pdf model has been developed which specifies the variability of the average rectal wall thickness. The model is based on the histogram of 587 randomly selected patients with prostate cancer.  Results:   The average wall thicknesses were determined based on the rectal structure contours drawn on the planning CT image set of the patient. The pdf describing the variability of the rectal wall thickness (pdfTW) is represented as a three-mode Gaussian mixture of specific (μF,σF); (μPF,σPF) and (μE,σE) and individual weights (wF, wPF, and wE) representing full, partially full, and empty rectal states, respectively.  Conclusion:   A 2D Gaussian pdf of rectal motion and rectal thickness (2D pdfM&TW) function, as a product-mixture model of the pdf of the rectal motion (pdfM) and the pdfTW, was developed using published and experimental data, respectively, and presented mathematically. Using correlation values between the functions pdfM and pdfTW, the sensitivity of profiles and projections to the 2D pdfM&TW is numerically demonstrated.""","""['Grigor Grigorov', 'James C L Chow', 'Glenn Bauman', 'Johnson Darko', 'Alex Kiciak', 'Ernest Osei']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""J Med Imaging Radiat Sci""","""['Robust treatment planning for intensity modulated radiotherapy of prostate cancer based on coverage probabilities.', 'IMRT boost dose planning on dominant intraprostatic lesions: gold marker-based three-dimensional fusion of CT with dynamic contrast-enhanced and 1H-spectroscopic MRI.', 'Radiotherapy of prostate cancer with or without intensity modulated beams: a planning comparison.', 'Distinct effects of rectum delineation methods in 3D-conformal vs. IMRT treatment planning of prostate cancer.', 'Benefit of intensity modulated and image-guided radiotherapy in prostate cancer.']"""

Experiments were conducted on a clinically relevant ex vivo model involving whole human prostates harvested from radical prostatectomy. The light source placed in the urethral track was an array of light emitting diodes (LEDs), illuminating the prostate with a delivered light power on the urethral wall within the safety limit. A dual-modality imaging system acquired PA and ultrasound (US) images simultaneously in the same way as in transrectal ultrasound (TRUS), with the US imaging presenting the tissue structure and PA imaging detecting the ICG solution. The imaging results demonstrated that tubes containing ICG solution at different concentrations can be detected at different positions in the prostate within a 2 cm range around from the urethral wall. Considering the sizes of regular human prostates, the proposed transurethral illumination in combination with transrectal US detection can facilitate PA molecular imaging over the entire prostate in a non-invasive manner, which makes it possible to further improve the PCa diagnosing efficiency with better molecular sensitivity and resulted better biopsy accuracy and much reduced pain for patients.  Impact statement:   Differentiating cancerous tissues from healthy ones is critical in the diagnosis of prostate cancer (PCa). However, due to the low sensitivity of ultrasound (US) imaging to cancerous tissues, transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) guided biopsies, current standard procedure for diagnosing PCa, suffer from low core yield, leading to under-sampling and under-grading of clinically significant tumors. Via the experiment on the ex vivo human prostates, we evaluated the translational potential of photoacoustic imaging (PAI) based on a safe light emitting diodes (LED) source for detecting the molecular information in deep human prostate. We showed that transurethral light illumination in combination with transrectal US detection can facilitate PA molecular imaging over an entire human prostate in a non-invasive manner.

The effect of this interfacial charge on the signal was demonstrated through PSMA (prostate cancer biomarker) sensing using a dual-gate ISFET biosensor.

This can result in off-resonance magnetic field leading to geometric distortions including signal stretching and signal pile-up in the reconstructed images. Using a set of EPI data acquired with blip-up and blip-down phase encoding gradient directions, model based reconstruction has recently been proposed that can correct these distortions by using a B0 field estimated from a separate B0 scan. However, change in the size of the rectal air region across time can occur that can result in a mismatch of the B0 field to the EPI scan. Also, the measured B0 field itself can be erroneous in regions of low Signal to Noise ratio around the prostate rectal air interface. In this work, using a set of single shot EPI data acquired with blip-up and blip-down phase encoding gradient directions, a novel joint model based reconstruction is proposed that can account for changes in the off resonance effects between the B0 and EPI scans. For ten prostate patients, using a measured B0 field as an initial B0 estimate, on a 5-point scale (1-5) image quality scores evaluated by an experienced radiologist, the proposed framework achieved scores of 3.50 ± 0.85 and 3.40 ± 0.51 for b-values of 0 and 500 s/mm2, respectively compared to 3.40 ± 0.70 and 3.30 ± 0.67 for model based reconstruction.

Due to poor biodistribution of intravenously administered anticancer drugs within the bone, chemotherapy is not optimally effective in treating bone metastasis. Additionally, overexpression of receptor activator of nuclear factor κB ligand (RANKL) in the bone microenvironment drives the vicious, destructive cycle of progression of bone metastasis and bone resorption. We hypothesized that the combination treatment - with docetaxel (TXT), an anticancer drug encapsulated in sustained release biodegradable nanoparticles (TXT-NPs) that are designed to localize in bone marrow, and denosumab monoclonal antibody (DNmb), which binds to RANKL - could be more effective than either treatment alone. We tested our hypothesis in intraosseous prostate cancer (PC-3) cell-induced osteolytic mouse model of bone metastasis with treatments given intravenously. The results demonstrated better efficacy with TXT-NPs than with TXT-CrEL or saline control in inhibiting progression of metastasis and improving survival. TXT-NPs showed ~3-fold higher drug levels in metastasized bone tissue at 1 wk post-administration than TXT-CrEL, thus explaining their efficacy. However, the combination treatment (TXT-NPs + DNmb) given simultaneously was significantly more effective in inhibiting metastatic progression; it caused early tumor regression and improved survival, and caused no body weight loss or tumor relapse, even when the treatment was discontinued, whereas TXT-NPs or DNmb alone treatments showed tumor relapse after an initial regression. Micro-CT analysis of the bone from the combination treatment showed no bone loss and normal bone mineral content, bone density, and bone volume fraction, whereas TXT-NPs or DNmb alone treatments showed bone loss. Confirming the above results, histochemical analysis of the bone from the combination treatment demonstrated normal bone morphology, and osteoblast and osteoclast cell activities. In conclusion, TXT-NPs and DNmb in combination, because of their complementary roles in breaking the cross talk between cancer cells and bone cells, was significantly effective in treating bone metastasis.""","""['Sivakumar Vijayaraghavalu', 'Yue Gao', 'Mohammed Tanjimur Rahman', 'Richard Rozic', 'Nima Sharifi', 'Ronald J Midura', 'Vinod Labhasetwar']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Biomaterials""","""['Nanoparticle-mediated synergistic drug combination for treating bone metastasis.', 'Inhibition of bone loss with surface-modulated, drug-loaded nanoparticles in an intraosseous model of prostate cancer.', 'Influence of simultaneous targeting of the bone morphogenetic protein pathway and RANK/RANKL axis in osteolytic prostate cancer lesion in bone.', 'Therapeutic Potential of Denosumab in Patients With Lung Cancer: Beyond Prevention of Skeletal Complications.', 'RANKL inhibition in the treatment of bone metastases.', 'Nanoparticle-mediated synergistic drug combination for treating bone metastasis.', 'Biomimetic doxorubicin/ginsenoside co-loading nanosystem for chemoimmunotherapy of acute myeloid leukemia.', 'Cross Talk Between Macrophages and Cancer Cells in the Bone Metastatic Environment.', 'Recent Advances in the Treatment of Bone Metastases and Primary Bone Tumors: An Up-to-Date Review.', 'Targeting treatment options for castration-resistant prostate cancer.']"""

The aim of this work was to evaluate whether CgA can serve as a response predictor for 177Lu-prostate-specific membrane antigen 617 (PSMA) radioligand therapy (RLT) in comparison with the established tumor markers. Methods: One hundred consecutive patients with metastasized castration-resistant prostate cancer scheduled for PSMA RLT were evaluated for prostate-specific antigen (PSA), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and CgA at baseline and in follow-up of PSMA RLT. Tumor uptake of PSMA ligand, a known predictive marker for response, was assessed as a control variable. Results: From the 100 evaluated patients, 35 had partial remission, 16 stable disease, 15 mixed response, and 36 progression of disease. Tumor uptake above salivary gland uptake translated into partial remission, with an odds ratio (OR) of 60.265 (95% confidence interval [CI], 5.038-720.922). Elevated LDH implied a reduced chance for partial remission, with an OR of 0.094 (95% CI, 0.017-0.518), but increased the frequency of progressive disease (OR, 2.717; 95% CI, 1.391-5.304). All patients who achieved partial remission had a normal baseline LDH. Factor-2 elevation of CgA increased the risk for progression, with an OR of 3.089 (95% CI, 1.302-7.332). Baseline PSA had no prognostic value for response prediction. Conclusion: In our cohort, baseline PSA had no prognostic value for response prediction. LDH was the marker with the strongest prognostic value, and elevated LDH increased the risk for progression of disease under PSMA RLT. Elevated CgA demonstrated a moderate impact as a negative prognostic marker in general but was explicitly related to the presence of liver metastases.

Objective:   To determine whether there is a clear oncologic benefit to ADT in the setting of node-positive prostate cancer treated with postoperative radiotherapy.  Methods:   We analyzed data for 372 prostate cancer patients treated at San Raffaele Hospital with postoperative radiotherapy for node-positive disease after radical prostatectomy, 272 received both ADT and radiotherapy. Eighty-six men were followed without an event for more than 10 years.  Results:   Patients who received postoperative radiotherapy + ADT had more aggressive disease, with higher preoperative PSA level, higher rate of ISUP grade 5, pT3b-T4 tumors and ≥3 positive nodes. At multivariable Cox regression, the comparison between men treated by postoperative radiotherapy + ADT vs. radiotherapy alone did not show a significant difference for overall (hazards ratio: 0.91; 95% confidence interval: 0.45, 1.84; P = 0.8) and cancer-specific survival (hazards ratio: 5.39; 95% confidence intervalI: 0.70, 41.39; P = 0.11). These results remained consistent in a number of sensitivity analyses, including propensity score matching. Consideration of 95% CIs suggests that a clinically significant benefit of ADT in node-positive patients receiving radiotherapy after surgery is unlikely.  Conclusions:   We can exclude the sort of large survival benefit that would be required to justify the risks and toxicities of ADT in men with node-positive disease receiving postoperative radiotherapy.

We sought to test the impact of timing between RP and RT on adverse events rate.  Methods:   Using the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) 9601 trial cohort, we performed post hoc analysis of 760 men with biochemical recurrence after RP, who received subsequent RT. Bowel adverse events (rectal urgency, diarrhea, and hematochezia); bladder adverse events (urinary frequency, dysuria, hematuria, and incontinence); and new onset of erectile dysfunction were documented as acute (<90 days after starting RT) or chronic, at each visit, per trial protocol. Regression analysis tested the impact of time between RP and RT on the aforementioned adverse events, after adjusting for potential confounders.  Results:   The rate of acute bladder, acute bowel, late bladder, late bowel, and late impotence adverse events was, respectively, 49.3%, 60.9%, 61.2%, 48.8%, and 13.6% in patients with a time period between RP and RT ≤ 2.1 years (the median) vs. 47.5%, 63%, 59.1%, 47%, and 14.5% in patients with >2.1 years (all P > 0.5). At multivariable analysis, time from RP to RT was not an independent predictor of acute bladder (odds ratio [OR]: 1.002), acute bowel (OR: 1.024), chronic bladder (OR: 0.976), chronic bowel (OR: 1.023), and late impotence (OR: 1.031) adverse events (all P > 0.4).  Conclusions:   There was no impact of timing between RP and RT on urinary, bowel, and erectile adverse events related to RT.

Therefore, cancer-specific mortality (CSM) rates after radical prostatectomy (RP) ± adjuvant radiation therapy (aRT) vs. external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) were tested.  Methods:   Within the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database (2004-2015), 17,897 clinically localized prostate cancer patients with biopsy GS 9-10 were identified who either received RP ± aRT or EBRT. Temporal trends, cumulative incidence plots and multivariable competing-risks regression analyses were used after propensity score matching. Sensitivity analyses were performed according to primary treatment type (RP only vs. EBRT).  Results:   Of all, 8,890 (49.7%) underwent EBRT vs. 9,007 (50.3%) underwent RP. Of those, 2,584 (28.7%) received aRT. No significant change in treatment assignment was recorded over time. In cumulative incidence smoothed plots, 10 year CSM rates were 19.9% vs. 19.6% (P = 0.3) and 10 year other-cause mortalityrates were 11.5% vs. 31.2%, respectively, in RP vs. EBRT patients (P < 0.001). In multivariable competing-risks regression analyses, RP did not reach independent predictor status of lower CSM (hazard ratio (HR): 0.93, P = 0.2). In sensitivity analyses within RP only vs. EBRT patients, RP represented an independent predictor of lower CSM (HR: 0.76, P < 0.001).  Conclusions:   In biopsy GS 9-10 patients, no CSM differences were observed after RP ± aRT vs. EBRT. However, in patients in whom RP did not have to be combined with aRT, RP seems to be associated with a minor improvement in cancer-specific survival compared to EBRT.

Materials and methods:   Retrospective analysis of 23 (51.1%) patients who underwent sLND and 22 (48.9%) men who received ADT for LN-only recurrence. Biochemical recurrence (BCR) was defined as prostate-specific antigen (PSA) >0.2 ng/ml with an increased trend and radiological recurrence (RAR) was defined as a positive imaging study after sLND or ADT. Second line systemic therapies (SST) were defined as any systemic therapy administered for progression. Predictors of BCR, RAR, and SST were assessed with Cox regression analyses.  Results:   Mean PSA reduction was significantly higher after sLND than ADT (62.8% vs. 17.7%; P = 0.04). Clinical outcomes were not statistically different between the 2 groups. However, there was a trend toward a longer time to BCR (13.3 vs. 6 months; P = 0.2) and RAR (21.1 vs. 14.2 months, P = 0.09) in sLND patients than ADT. Median time to SST was longer in the sLND group than ADT (P = 0.04). Univariable Cox regression analyses showed that PSA doubling time and pT stage were associated with RAR and SST (all P < 0.05).  Conclusions:   In patients with nonmetastatic, castration-resistant prostate cancer, sLND resulted in greater PSA decrease than ADT.

As the prevalence of thyroid cancer increases worldwide, thyroid cancer survivorship is associated with increasing personal and cumulative costs. Few studies have examined the psychological and material economic costs experienced by thyroid cancer survivors. We seek to estimate the comparative prevalence of financial and psychological hardship among thyroid cancer and non-thyroid cancer patients in the United States.  Methods:   The 2011 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey Experiences with Cancer databank was queried to identify thyroid and non-thyroid (colon, breast, lung, prostate) cancer survivors. This survey includes assessments of financial stress, material hardship, and psychological financial hardship. Cancer incidence-based weighted estimates of responses were compared between thyroid and non-thyroid cancer survivors. Independent predictors of material and psychological financial burden were identified through separate multivariate regression models.  Results:   Thyroid cancer survivors more frequently reported psychological financial burden compared to non-thyroid cancer (46.1% vs 24.0%, P = .04). Material financial hardship (28.1% vs 19.9%, P = .37) and concurrent material and psychological hardship (25.1% vs 12.5%, P = .09) were noted at similar frequencies between thyroid and non-thyroid cancer survivors. However, on multivariate analysis, only younger age and lack of health insurance coverage were independently associated with psychological financial hardship.  Conclusion:   Thyroid cancer survivors report greater psychological financial hardship than non-thyroid cancer survivors. Because this financial burden may be underrecognized in the medical community, further studies should be conducted to aid physicians in better understanding the impact of a thyroid cancer diagnosis.""","""['Courtney E Barrows', 'Janeil M Belle', 'Aaron Fleishman', 'Carrie C Lubitz', 'Benjamin C James']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Surgery""","""['Patient-Reported Financial Burden in Thyroid Cancer.', 'Financial Hardship Associated With Cancer in the United States: Findings From a Population-Based Sample of Adult Cancer Survivors.', 'Medical Financial Hardship Intensity and Financial Sacrifice Associated with Cancer in the United States.', 'Financial Hardship and the Economic Effect of Childhood Cancer Survivorship.', 'Financial Hardships Experienced by Cancer Survivors: A Systematic Review.', 'Access Denied: Disparities in Thyroid Cancer Clinical Trials.', 'Eliciting Low-Risk Thyroid Cancer Treatment Preferences Using Clinical Vignettes: A Pilot Study.', 'Endocrine Tumor Classification via Machine-Learning-Based Elastography: A Systematic Scoping Review.', 'Thyroid nodules: Global, economic, and personal burdens.', 'Anxiety and depression status prior to radioactive iodine therapy among differentiated thyroid cancer patients during the COVID‑19 pandemic.']"""

Epigenetic therapies such as BET Bromodomain inhibition can change the transcriptome of tumor cells, possibly making them more immunogenic and thus susceptible to immune targeting.  Methods:   We characterized the effects of BET bromodomain inhibition using JQ1 on PD-L1 and HLA-ABC expression in two human prostate cell lines, DU145 and PC3. RNA-Seq was performed to assess changes on a genome-wide level. A cytotoxic T cell killing assay was performed in MC38-OVA cells treated with JQ1 to demonstrate increased immunogenicity. In vivo experiments in the Myc-Cap model were conducted to show the effects of JQ1 administration in concert with anti-CTLA-4 checkpoint blockade.  Results:   Here, we show that targeting BET bromodomains using the small molecule inhibitor JQ1 decreased PD-L1 expression and mitigated tumor progression in prostate cancer models. Mechanistically, BET bromodomain inhibition increased MHC I expression and increased the immunogenicity of tumor cells. Transcriptional profiling showed that BET bromodomain inhibition regulates distinct networks of antigen processing and immune checkpoint molecules. In murine models, treatment with JQ1 was additive with anti-CTLA-4 immunotherapy, resulting in an increased CD8/Treg ratio.  Conclusions:   BET Bromodomain inhibition can mediate changes in expression at a genome wide level in prostate cancer cells, resulting in an increased susceptibility to CD8 T cell targeting. These data suggest that combining BET bromodomain inhibition with immune checkpoint blockade may have clinical activity in prostate cancer patients.""","""['Wendy Mao', 'Ali Ghasemzadeh', 'Zachary T Freeman', 'Aleksandar Obradovic', 'Matthew G Chaimowitz', 'Thomas R Nirschl', 'Emily McKiernan', 'Srinivasan Yegnasubramanian', 'Charles G Drake']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""J Immunother Cancer""","""['Inhibition of bromodomain and extra-terminal (BET) proteins increases NKG2D ligand MICA expression and sensitivity to NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity in multiple myeloma cells: role of cMYC-IRF4-miR-125b interplay.', 'Bromo- and extraterminal domain protein inhibition improves immunotherapy efficacy in hepatocellular carcinoma.', 'Maintenance of MYC expression promotes de novo resistance to BET bromodomain inhibition in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Immune Checkpoint Therapies in Prostate Cancer.', 'The Next Immune-Checkpoint Inhibitors: PD-1/PD-L1 Blockade in Melanoma.', 'BET Inhibition Sensitizes Immunologically Cold Rb-Deficient Prostate Cancer to Immune Checkpoint Blockade.', 'Targeting Epigenetic Mechanisms: A Boon for Cancer Immunotherapy.', 'It Runs in the Bromodomain Family: Speckled Proteins (SP) Play a Role in the Antitumor Immune Response in Solid Tumors.', 'Emerging Epigenetic-Based Nanotechnology for Cancer Therapy: Modulating the Tumor Microenvironment.', 'Analysis and therapeutic targeting of the EP300 and CREBBP acetyltransferases in anaplastic large cell lymphoma and Hodgkin lymphoma.']"""

Here we examine the association between depression and anxiety symptoms in a population-based sample of men.  Methods:   A cross-sectional analysis was conducted on a subsample of 6 585 male participants aged 49-69 from 2009 to 2015 survey cycle of the Atlantic PATH. Mild, moderate or severe depression or anxiety indicators were primary outcomes and were assessed using the Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) scale and the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). The presence of a lifetime history of PCa, other forms of cancer (except PCa) or absence of either was the main predictor variable.  Results:   An estimated 3.9% of men self-identified as having had a history of PCa diagnosis, 11.3% of men identified as having had a history of other forms of cancer and 84.9% reported never having had a diagnosis of cancer in their lifetime, respectively. Survivors of PCa had 2.45 or 2.05 statistically significantly higher odds of screening positive for current anxiety or depressive symptoms, respectively, compared with those who identified as without a lifetime history of any form of cancer in controlled analyses (including survivorship time).  Conclusions:   Increased rates of anxiety and depression among men with a history of PCa highlight the need for mental health screening among PCa survivors.

Our aim was to investigate the anatomy of cervico-thoracic-ganglia-complex (CTG-C) in the MR part of multimodal 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/MR imaging, in view of PET factors hindering its proper identification. Patients and methods In 106 patients, 212 sites of the CTG-C were retrospectively reviewed to assess the radiotracer uptake (SUVmax), size, shape, position, symmetry of location and visual uptake intensity. Asymmetry of PSMA-ligand uptake and increased uptake were regarded as risk factors of malignancy. Results In 66.0% left (L) and 53.8% right (R) CTG-C we noticed configurations, resembling the shape of an exclamation-mark, a question-mark, or its part (called ""typical""). Tumor-like CTG-C shapes (oval, binodular or longitudinal) were detected in 28.3% L-CTG-C and in 40.6% R-CTG-C. When visual assessment of PET suggested malignancy, the recognition of ""typical"" shape of underlying CTG-C on MR generated a rise in the accuracy of their proper identification (from 34.4% to 75%, χ2(1) = 70.4; p < 0.001). Recognizing the shape of the CTG-C as ""typical"" in MR allowed us to classify as ""not-suspicious"" 61.9% of all CTG-C which were treated as ""suspicious"" after sole PET assessment. Conclusions The characteristic shape of cervico-thoracic-ganglia-complex (resembling a question-mark, or its part) helps in proper recognition of CTG-C on multimodal whole-body 68Ga-PSMA-ligand PET/MR imaging, when detectable uptake might lead to considering pathology.""","""['Ewa J Bialek', 'Bogdan Malkowski']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Radiol Oncol""","""['Is the level of diffusion restriction in celiac and cervico-thoracic sympathetic ganglia helpful in their proper recognition on PSMA\xa0ligand PET/MR?', 'Celiac ganglia: can they be misinterpreted on multimodal 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/MR?', 'Are superior cervical sympathetic ganglia avid on whole body 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/magnetic resonance?: a comprehensive morphologic and molecular assessment in patients with prostate cancer.', 'PET/CT With 68Ga-PSMA in Prostate Cancer: Radiopharmaceutical Background and Clinical Implications.', 'The role of 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT scan in biochemical recurrence after primary treatment for prostate cancer: a systematic review of the literature.']"""

Objective:   To evaluate the feasibility and utility of incorporating comparative gene expression information into the precision medicine framework for difficult-to-treat pediatric and young adult patients with cancer.  Design, setting, and participants:   This cohort study was conducted as a consortium between the University of California, Santa Cruz (UCSC) Treehouse Childhood Cancer Initiative and clinical genomic trials. RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) data were obtained from the following 4 clinical sites and analyzed at UCSC: British Columbia Children's Hospital (n = 31), Lucile Packard Children's Hospital at Stanford University (n = 80), CHOC Children's Hospital and Hyundai Cancer Institute (n = 46), and the Pacific Pediatric Neuro-Oncology Consortium (n = 24). The study dates were January 1, 2016, to March 22, 2017.  Exposures:   Participants underwent tumor RNA-Seq profiling as part of 4 separate clinical trials at partner hospitals. The UCSC either downloaded RNA-Seq data from a partner institution for analysis in the cloud or provided a Docker pipeline that performed the same analysis at a partner institution. The UCSC then compared each participant's tumor RNA-Seq profile with more than 11 000 uniformly analyzed tumor profiles from pediatric and young adult patients with cancer, downloaded from public data repositories. These comparisons were used to identify genes and pathways that are significantly overexpressed in each patient's tumor. Results of the UCSC analysis were presented to clinical partners.  Main outcomes and measures:   Feasibility of a third-party institution (UCSC Treehouse Childhood Cancer Initiative) to obtain tumor RNA-Seq data from patients, conduct comparative analysis, and present analysis results to clinicians; and proportion of patients for whom comparative tumor gene expression analysis provided useful clinical and biological information.  Results:   Among 144 samples from children and young adults (median age at diagnosis, 9 years; range, 0-26 years; 72 of 118 [61.0%] male [26 patients sex unknown]) with a relapsed, refractory, or rare cancer treated on precision medicine protocols, RNA-Seq-derived gene expression was potentially useful for 99 of 144 samples (68.8%) compared with DNA mutation information that was potentially useful for only 34 of 74 samples (45.9%).  Conclusions and relevance:   This study's findings suggest that tumor RNA-Seq comparisons may be feasible and highlight the potential clinical utility of incorporating such comparisons into the clinical genomic interpretation framework for difficult-to-treat pediatric and young adult patients with cancer.

Methods:   A total of 531 patients who underwent RP during 2010 to 2017 at West China Hospital were enrolled in this retrospective study. Preoperative and postoperative factors including age, BMI, PSA, clinical T stage and biopsy Gleason score were analyzed. Univariate analysis and logistic regression were used to find out the potential predictive factors for PSM. Two logistic regression models were built to evaluate the role of apical prostate biopsy in predicting urethral/apical margin status.  Results:   The overall PSM rate was about 30.1% (160/531) and 97 of them were reported urethral/apical PSM. The incidence of urethral or apical PSM in patients with positive cores in the apical prostate was higher than those without (23.0% vs 9.9%, P < .001). We further found that the multivariable model with positive apical prostate biopsy could significantly increase the predictive value of urethral or apical PSM status (AUC: 0.744 vs 0.783, P = .016). Our analysis also showed that neo-adjuvant hormone therapy was an independent protective factor for urethral or apical PSM in patients with positive apical prostate biopsy, but not all patients.  Conclusion:   This study revealed the necessity of apical prostate biopsy to predict the risk of apical or urethral PSM.

However, few studies have investigated these associations by type of ADT, particularly for newer ADTs such as the gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) antagonist degarelix. We investigated the risk of cardiovascular disease by type of ADT in a real-world setting.  Methods:   We identified men newly diagnosed with prostate cancer, from 2009 to 2015, from the Scottish Cancer Registry and ADTs from the nationwide Prescribing Information System. Cardiovascular events were based upon hospitalization (from hospital records) or death from cardiovascular disease (from death records). We used Cox regression to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for cardiovascular events with time-varying ADT exposure, comparing ADT users with untreated patients, after adjusting for potential confounders, including prior cardiovascular disease.  Results:   The cohort contained 20,216 prostate cancer patients, followed for 73,570 person-years, during which there were 3,853 cardiovascular events. ADT was associated with a 30% increase in cardiovascular events (adjusted HR = 1.3; 95% CI = 1.2, 1.4). This reflected increases in cardiovascular events associated with GnRH agonists (adjusted HR = 1.3; 95% CI = 1.2, 1.4), degarelix (adjusted HR = 1.5; 95% CI = 1.2, 1.9), but not bicalutamide monotherapy (adjusted HR = 1.0; 95% CI = 0.82, 1.3).  Conclusions:   There were increased risks of cardiovascular disease with the use of GnRH agonists and degarelix, but not with bicalutamide monotherapy.

We aimed to estimate the prevalence of prostate cancer screening and the perception of potential benefits and harms of screening, among the Portuguese general population.  Methods:   A representative sample of Portuguese-speaking inhabitants in mainland Portugal was selected, using a stratified probabilistic sampling procedure; men above 40 were considered for analysis (n = 414). Data on sociodemographic characteristics, lifetime use and usual frequency of prostate cancer screening (prostate-specific antigen test or digital rectal examination) and perception of potential benefits and adverse effects of cancer screening were assessed using face-to-face interviews, by structured questionnaire.  Results:   The proportion of participants who reported having been submitted to prostate cancer screening at least once in their lifetime was 44.2% (95% confidence interval: 37.5-51.0; 13.8% only digital rectal examination, 12.2% only prostate-specific antigen test, and 18.2% digital rectal examination and prostate-specific antigen test).

We also compared the performance of these calculators to that of multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging naïve prostate cancer risk calculators.  Materials and methods:   We identified men without a previous prostate cancer diagnosis who underwent transperineal template saturation prostate biopsy with fusion guided targeted biopsy between November 2014 and March 2018 at our academic tertiary referral center. Any Gleason pattern 4 or greater was defined as clinically significant prostate cancer. Predictors, which were patient age, prostate specific antigen, digital rectal examination, prostate volume, family history, previous prostate biopsy and the highest region of interest according to the PI-RADS™ (Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System), were retrospectively collected. Four multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging prostate cancer risk calculators and 2 multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging naïve prostate cancer risk calculators were evaluated for discrimination, calibration and the clinical net benefit using ROC analysis, calibration plots and decision curve analysis.  Results:   Of the 468 men 193 (41%) were diagnosed with clinically significant prostate cancer. Three multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging prostate cancer risk calculators showed similar discrimination with a ROC AUC significantly higher than that of the other prostate cancer risk calculators (AUC 0.83-0.85 vs 0.69-0.74). Calibration in the large showed 2% deviation from the true amount of clinically significant prostate cancer for 2 multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging risk calculators while the other calculators showed worse calibration at 11% to 27%. A clinical net benefit was observed only for 3 multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging risk calculators at biopsy thresholds of 15% or greater.

Materials and methods:   The Canary PASS (Prostate Active Surveillance Study) is a protocol driven, active surveillance cohort with a prespecified prostate specific antigen and surveillance biopsy regimen. Men included in this study had Gleason Grade Group 1 or 2 disease at diagnosis and fewer than 5 years between diagnosis and enrollment, and had undergone 1 or more surveillance biopsies. The reclassification risk, defined as an increase in the Gleason score on subsequent biopsy, was compared between African American and Caucasian American men using Cox proportional hazards models. In the subset of men who underwent delayed prostatectomy the rate of adverse pathology findings, defined as pT3a or greater disease, or Gleason Grade Group 3 or greater, was compared in African American and Caucasian American men.  Results:   Of the 1,315 men 89 (7%) were African American and 1,226 (93%) were Caucasian American. There was no difference in the treatment rate in African American and Caucasian American men. In multivariate models African American race was not associated with the risk of reclassification (HR 1.16, 95% CI 0.78-1.72). Of the 441 men who underwent prostatectomy after a period of active surveillance the rate of adverse pathology was similar in those who were African American and Caucasian American (46% vs 47%, p=0.99).  Conclusions:   Of men on active surveillance who followed a standardized protocol of regular prostate specific antigen testing and biopsy those who were African American were not at increased risk for pathological reclassification while on active surveillance, or for adverse pathology findings at prostatectomy.

Species identification is not carried out mainly due to the complexity of the genus. Analysis of the ITS barcode has become standard for fungal identification, but in Alternaria it is only able to discriminate among species-groups or sections.  Methods:   We present three cases of cutaneous infection caused by Alternaria isolates morphologically identified as belonging to section Infectoriae. They have been morphologically characterised and phylogenetically delineated with five molecular markers (ITS, ATPase, gapdh, rpb2 and tef1).  Results:   Mycotic infections have been diagnosed by repeated cultures and histopathological examination in two of the cases. The polyphasic approach has allowed to delineate three new species of Alternaria section Infectoriae, that is A anthropophila, A atrobrunnea and A guarroi. ATPase has been the only locus able to discriminate most of the species (29 out of 31) currently sequenced in this section, including A infectoria the commonest reported species causing alternariosis. Susceptibility test showed different antifungal patterns for the three species, although terbinafine was the most active in vitro drug against these fungi.  Conclusions:   The ATPase gene is recommended as an alternative barcode locus to identify Alternaria clinical isolates in section Infectoriae. Our results reinforce the relevance of identification of Alternaria isolates at the species level and the necessity to carry out antifungal susceptibility testing to determine the most adequate drug for treatment.""","""['Isabel Iturrieta-González', 'Isabel Pujol', 'Simona Iftimie', 'Dania García', 'Vanesa Morente', 'Rosana Queralt', 'Marcela Guevara-Suarez', 'Ana Alastruey-Izquierdo', 'Frederic Ballester', 'Margarita Hernández-Restrepo', 'Josepa Gené']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Mycoses""","""['Cutaneous Alternaria infectoria infection diagnosed by molecular techniques in a renal transplant patient.', 'Alternaria species associated to wheat black point identified through a multilocus sequence approach.', 'Successful Posaconazole Therapy of Disseminated Alternariosis due to Alternaria infectoria in a Heart Transplant Recipient.', 'Alternaria arborescens infection in a healthy individual and literature review of cutaneous alternariosis.', 'Enhancement in serum (1-3)-β-D-glucan level by cutaneous alternariosis: A case report and literature review.', 'Phaeohyphomycosis in Solid Organ Transplant Recipients: A Case Series and Narrative Review of the Literature.', 'Identification and Toxicological Characterization of Alternaria japonica Strains.', '\ufeffPleocatenatachiangraiensis gen. et. sp. nov.

In this paper, we aimed to determine the compliance with the minimum acceptable technical parameters for prostate mpMRI defined by PI-RADS v2 in tertiary care centers in Turkey.  Methods:   We sent a survey to all radiology departments of tertiary referral hospitals in Turkey (n=120) to evaluate their adherence to PI-RADS v2 technical specifications. Statistical analysis was performed using chi-square, Fisher exact, ANOVA, and the Student t tests. The cutoff values for image acquisition times were also determined with receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis. P values <0.05 were considered statistically significant.  Results:   One hundred and eleven clinics responded to our survey (response rate, 92.5%). Prostate MRI was reported to be performed in 61 centers, of which 26 (42.6%) used 3 T (Tesla) scanner while 35 (57.4%) used 1.5 T. The adherence to slice thickness, in-plane phase and frequency resolutions on T2-weighted imaging were 68.9%, 41%, and 9.8%, respectively. The adherence to the same parameters on diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) were higher compared with T2-weighted imaging (85.2%, 62.3%, and 78.7%, respectively). In comparative analysis, the adherence to slice thickness, field of view (FOV) and in-plane phase resolution on T2-weighted imaging were higher for 3 T compared with 1.5 T scanners (P = 0.004, P = 0.041, and P = 0.001, respectively). T2-weighted imaging acquisition time was significantly longer for the centers that adhered to FOV (P = 0.034) and in-plane T2-weighted imaging phase resolution (P = 0.028). The DWI scan time was significantly longer when they adhered to DWI-FOV (P = 0.014) and b value ≥1400 s/mm2 (P = 0.008). The calculated cutoff of scan times were 220 s in T2-weighted imaging and 312 s in DWI to ensure the compliance with voxel sizes and b value criteria.

Wnts activate K+ currents by elevating intracellular Ca2+ and trigger Ca2+ release from intracellular stores. Control of potential by Wnt ligands has significant implications for gene transcription and opens up a novel avenue to interfere with this critical pathway.  Abstract:   The Wnt signalling network determines gene transcription with free intracellular Ca2+ ( Cai2+ ) and β-catenin as major intracellular signal transducers. Despite its critical importance during development and disease, many of the basic mechanisms of Wnt signal activation remain unclear. Here we show by single cell recording and simultaneous Cai2+ imaging in mammalian prostate cancer cells that an early step in the signal cascade is direct action on the cell membrane potential. We show that Wnt ligands 5A, 9B and 10B rapidly hyperpolarized the cells by activating K+ current by Ca2+ release from intracellular stores. Medium-throughput multi-well recordings showed responses to Wnts at concentrations of 2 nm. We identify a putative target for early events as a TRPM channel. Wnts thus act as ligands for ion channel activation in mammalian cells and membrane potential is an early indicator of control of transcription.""","""['Jonathan Ashmore', 'Hervør Olsen', 'Naja Sørensen', 'Christopher Thrasivoulou', 'Aamir Ahmed']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""J Physiol""","""['Activation of intracellular calcium by multiple Wnt ligands and translocation of β-catenin into the nucleus: a convergent model of Wnt/Ca2+ and Wnt/β-catenin pathways.', 'Signal transduction and ion channels in guard cells.', 'Recombinant WNTs differentially activate β-catenin-dependent and -independent signalling in mouse microglia-like cells.', 'Differential expression of canonical and non-canonical Wnt ligands in ameloblastoma.', 'Store-Independent Orai Channels Regulated by STIM.', 'Listening in to the Cell.', 'Permeabilizing Cell Membranes with Electric Fields.', 'Caloric Restriction and Ketogenic Diet Therapy for Epilepsy: A Molecular Approach Involving Wnt Pathway and KATP Channels.', 'Interplay Between Ion Channels and the Wnt/β-Catenin Signaling Pathway in Cancers.']"""

Complement system represents an important component of the inflammatory response, which acts as a functional bridge between the innate and adaptive immune response. C1q, the first recognition subcomponent of the complement classical pathway, has recently been shown to be involved in a range of pathophysiological functions that are not dependent on complement activation. C1q is expressed in the microenvironment of various types of human tumors, including melanoma, prostate, mesothelioma, and ovarian cancers, where it can exert a protective or a harmful effect on cancer progression. Despite local synthesis of C1q in the central nervous system, the involvement of C1q in glioma pathogenesis has been poorly investigated. We, therefore, performed a bioinformatics analysis, using Oncomine dataset and UALCAN database in order to assess whether the expression of the genes encoding for the three chains of C1q (C1qA, C1qB, and C1qC) could serve as a potential prognostic marker for gliomas.

Patients and methods:   We included 1140 consecutive RP patients (2006-2015) with non-organ confined (pT3) prostate cancer and either positive surgical margins (R1) and/or lymph node involvement (pN1) and non-detectable postoperative prostate-specific antigen who received multidisciplinary aRT recommendations. Patients were stratified into adherence versus non-adherence to recommendations. Additionally, subgroups within pathologic criteria (pT3R1N0, pT3R0N1, pT3R1N1) were analyzed. Kaplan-Meier, as well as multivariable Cox regression analyses were used to assess biochemical recurrence (BCR)-free survival, metastasis-free survival, cancer-specific survival, and overall survival.  Results:   Overall, 508 (44.6%) patients were non-adherent. Of those, 273 (53.6%) did not receive any RT, and 235 (46.4%) received salvage RT. At 8 years, BCR-free survival was 57.7 versus 20.1%, metastasis-free survival was 76.5 versus 75.4%, cancer-specific survival was 91.7 versus 87.4%, and overall survival was 80.4 versus 75.8% in adherent versus non-adherent patients, respectively (P < .001).

Objective:   To model the clinical benefit of the nuclear-localized androgen receptor splice variant 7 (AR-V7) test for men with progressing metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) at the second line of therapy or greater to inform the choice of an androgen receptor signaling inhibitor (ARSI) or a taxane.  Design, setting, and participants:   The study population was a cross-sectional cohort of 193 unique patients with progressing mCRPC from whom 255 samples were drawn at the time of the second line or later treatment decision who then received an ARSI or taxane, with up to 3 yr of additional follow-up Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) were identified from blood samples and tested for AR-V7. Physicians were blinded to AR-V7 status and the testing laboratory was blinded to outcomes.  Outcome measurements and statistical analyses:   We measured physician propensity for choosing an ARSI or taxane based on patient prognosis. We also measured overall survival (OS) adjusted for physician propensity by drug class; OS data were analyzed both without and with knowledge of nuclear-localized AR-V7 status.  Results and limitations:   Treating physicians had a propensity for choosing a taxane over an ARSI for patients with more advanced disease or who received an ARSI as the immediate prior therapy. After adjusting for physician propensity, discernible OS differences were not observed between taxane- and ARSI-treated patients (median 15.6 vs 14.4 mo; p =0.11). Patients with detectable nuclear-localized AR-V7 in CTCs had superior survival with taxanes over ARSIs (median 9.8 vs 5.7 mo; p = 0.041). AR-V7-negative patients had superior survival on ARSIs over taxanes (p = 0.033) but overlapping curves limit the interpretation. Mutivariable models showed a robust interaction between AR-V7 status and drug, and a lower risk of death on taxanes for AR-V7-positive men.  Conclusions:   Use of the nuclear-localized AR-V7 CTC test to inform treatment choice can improve patient outcomes relative to decisions based solely on standard-of-care measures.

Therefore, we evaluated differences in BCR-free rate in prostate cancer patients who were BCR-free 4 years after 125I-brachytherapy alone. Furthermore, we evaluated predictors for PSA bounce and the correlation between testosterone and PSA bounce.  Methods:   From 2004 to 2012, 256 patients with prostate adenocarcinoma underwent 125I-brachytherapy alone. PSA and testosterone levels were monitored prior to 125I-brachytherapy, at 1, 3, 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, 36, 42, 48, 54 and 60 months after 125I-brachytherapy and yearly after 5-year follow-up. PSA bounce was defined as ≥0.2 ng/ml increase above the interval PSA nadir, followed by a decrease to nadir or below.  Results:   BCR-free rate in patients with PSA bounce (100% 7-year BCR-free rate) was significantly better (P < 0.044) than that in patients without PSA bounce (95.7% 7-year BCR-free rate) in patients who were BCR-free 4 years after 125I-brachytherapy alone (n = 223).

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of neoadjuvant chemohormonal therapy (NAC) followed by ""extended"" RP.  Methods:   A total of 87 patients with high-risk PCa prospectively underwent extended RP after NAC; most of the patients underwent 6 months of estramustine phosphate (EMP) 140 mg twice daily, along with a luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonist/antagonist. We developed our surgical technique to reduce the rate of positive surgical margins. We aimed to approach the muscle layer of the rectum by dissecting the mesorectal fascia and continuing the dissection through the mesorectum until the muscle layer of the rectum was exposed.  Results:   More than 1 year had elapsed after surgery in all 86 patients, with a median follow-up period of 37.7 months. The 3-year BCR-free survival was 74.9%. Multivariate Cox-regression analysis revealed that a positive core ratio of 50% or greater and pathological stage of pT3 or greater were independent predictors for BCR.

These structural variants are present in 0.5% to 1.0% of the population, making 15q11.2 BP1-BP2 the site of the most prevalent known pathogenic copy number variation (CNV). It is unknown to what extent this CNV influences brain structure and affects cognitive abilities.  Objective:   To determine the association of the 15q11.2 BP1-BP2 deletion and duplication CNVs with cortical and subcortical brain morphology and cognitive task performance.  Design, setting, and participants:   In this genetic association study, T1-weighted brain magnetic resonance imaging were combined with genetic data from the ENIGMA-CNV consortium and the UK Biobank, with a replication cohort from Iceland. In total, 203 deletion carriers, 45 247 noncarriers, and 306 duplication carriers were included. Data were collected from August 2015 to April 2019, and data were analyzed from September 2018 to September 2019.  Main outcomes and measures:   The associations of the CNV with global and regional measures of surface area and cortical thickness as well as subcortical volumes were investigated, correcting for age, age2, sex, scanner, and intracranial volume. Additionally, measures of cognitive ability were analyzed in the full UK Biobank cohort.  Results:   Of 45 756 included individuals, the mean (SD) age was 55.8 (18.3) years, and 23 754 (51.9%) were female. Compared with noncarriers, deletion carriers had a lower surface area (Cohen d = -0.41; SE, 0.08; P = 4.9 × 10-8), thicker cortex (Cohen d = 0.36; SE, 0.07; P = 1.3 × 10-7), and a smaller nucleus accumbens (Cohen d = -0.27; SE, 0.07; P = 7.3 × 10-5). There was also a significant negative dose response on cortical thickness (β = -0.24; SE, 0.05; P = 6.8 × 10-7). Regional cortical analyses showed a localization of the effects to the frontal, cingulate, and parietal lobes. Further, cognitive ability was lower for deletion carriers compared with noncarriers on 5 of 7 tasks.  Conclusions and relevance:   These findings, from the largest CNV neuroimaging study to date, provide evidence that 15q11.2 BP1-BP2 structural variation is associated with brain morphology and cognition, with deletion carriers being particularly affected. The pattern of results fits with known molecular functions of genes in the 15q11.2 BP1-BP2 region and suggests involvement of these genes in neuronal plasticity. These neurobiological effects likely contribute to the association of this CNV with neurodevelopmental disorders.""","""['Writing Committee for the ENIGMA-CNV Working Group;Dennis van der Meer', 'Ida E Sønderby', 'Tobias Kaufmann', 'G Bragi Walters', 'Abdel Abdellaoui', 'David Ames', 'Katrin Amunts', 'Micael Andersson', 'Nicola J Armstrong', 'Manon Bernard', 'Nicholas B Blackburn', 'John Blangero', 'Dorret I Boomsma', 'Henry Brodaty', 'Rachel M Brouwer', 'Robin Bülow', 'Wiepke Cahn', 'Vince D Calhoun', 'Svenja Caspers', 'Gianpiero L Cavalleri', 'Christopher R K Ching', 'Sven Cichon', 'Simone Ciufolini', 'Aiden Corvin', 'Benedicto Crespo-Facorro', 'Joanne E Curran', 'Shareefa Dalvie', 'Paola Dazzan', 'Eco J C de Geus', 'Greig I de Zubicaray', 'Sonja M C de Zwarte', 'Norman Delanty', 'Anouk den Braber', 'Sylvane Desrivieres', 'Marta Di Forti', 'Joanne L Doherty', 'Gary Donohoe', 'Stefan Ehrlich', 'Else Eising', 'Thomas Espeseth', 'Simon E Fisher', 'Tormod Fladby', 'Oleksandr Frei', 'Vincent Frouin', 'Masaki Fukunaga', 'Thomas Gareau', 'David C Glahn', 'Hans J Grabe', 'Nynke A Groenewold', 'Ómar Gústafsson', 'Jan Haavik', 'Asta K Haberg', 'Ryota Hashimoto', 'Jayne Y Hehir-Kwa', 'Derrek P Hibar', 'Manon H J Hillegers', 'Per Hoffmann', 'Laurena Holleran', 'Jouke-Jan Hottenga', 'Hilleke E Hulshoff Pol', 'Masashi Ikeda', 'Sébastien Jacquemont', 'Neda Jahanshad', 'Christiane Jockwitz', 'Stefan Johansson', 'Erik G Jönsson', 'Masataka Kikuchi', 'Emma E M Knowles', 'John B Kwok', 'Stephanie Le Hellard', 'David E J Linden', 'Jingyu Liu', 'Arvid Lundervold', 'Astri J Lundervold', 'Nicholas G Martin', 'Karen A Mather', 'Samuel R Mathias', 'Katie L McMahon', 'Allan F McRae', 'Sarah E Medland', 'Torgeir Moberget', 'Clara Moreau', 'Derek W Morris', 'Thomas W Mühleisen', 'Robin M Murray', 'Jan E Nordvik', 'Lars Nyberg', 'Loes M Olde Loohuis', 'Roel A Ophoff', 'Michael J Owen', 'Tomas Paus', 'Zdenka Pausova', 'Juan M Peralta', 'Bruce Pike', 'Carlos Prieto', 'Erin Burke Quinlan', 'Céline S Reinbold', 'Tiago Reis Marques', 'James J H Rucker', 'Perminder S Sachdev', 'Sigrid B Sando', 'Peter R Schofield', 'Andrew J Schork', 'Gunter Schumann', 'Jean Shin', 'Elena Shumskaya', 'Ana I Silva', 'Sanjay M Sisodiya', 'Vidar M Steen', 'Dan J Stein', 'Lachlan T Strike', 'Christian K Tamnes', 'Alexander Teumer', 'Anbupalam Thalamuthu', 'Diana Tordesillas-Gutiérrez', 'Anne Uhlmann', 'Magnús Ö Úlfarsson', ""Dennis van 't Ent"", 'Marianne B M van den Bree', 'Evangelos Vassos', 'Wei Wen', 'Katharina Wittfeld', 'Margaret J Wright', 'Tetyana Zayats', 'Anders M Dale', 'Srdjan Djurovic', 'Ingrid Agartz', 'Lars T Westlye', 'Hreinn Stefánsson', 'Kári Stefánsson', 'Paul M Thompson', 'Ole A Andreassen']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""JAMA Psychiatry""","""['No signs of neurodegenerative effects in 15q11.2 BP1-BP2 copy number variant carriers in the UK Biobank.', 'Clinical features and magnesium levels: Novel insights in 15q11.2 BP1-BP2 copy number variants.', 'Analysis of Diffusion Tensor Imaging Data From the UK Biobank Confirms Dosage Effect of 15q11.2 Copy Number Variation on White Matter and Shows Association With Cognition.', 'The 15q11.2 BP1-BP2 Microdeletion (Burnside-Butler) Syndrome: In Silico Analyses of the Four Coding Genes Reveal Functional Associations with Neurodevelopmental Phenotypes.', 'Clinical and genetic aspects of the 15q11.2 BP1-BP2 microdeletion disorder.', 'Association of epicardial adipose tissue volume with increased risk of hemodynamically significant coronary artery disease.', 'A review of the cognitive impact of neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric associated copy number variants.', 'Copy Number Variation and Structural Genomic Findings in 116 Cases of Sudden Unexplained Death between 1 and 28 Months of Age.', 'Prader-Willi Syndrome and Chromosome 15q11.2 BP1-BP2 Region: A Review.', 'Subcortical brain alterations in carriers of genomic copy number variants.']"""

Clinical trials testing AR-targeting therapies in breast cancer have been conducted. Assessment of AR-signal in breast cancer tissue maybe useful for treatment selections. Prostate specific antigen (PSA) is the product of an androgen-responsive gene. Serum PSA (sPSA) can be detected in women by a highly sensitive assay although the concentration is much lower than that observed in males. We investigated if sPSA reflects tumor biology, including AR signaling in breast cancer patients.  Methods:   In this study, 132 healthy controls and 144 breast cancer patients were enrolled. sPSA was evaluated by the chemiluminescent enzyme immunoassay (CLEIA) method. Correlations between sPSA and the various clinicopathological factors were analyzed.  Results:   In post-menopausal state, sPSA detection rate was significantly higher in breast cancer patients compared with controls (27.4% vs 11.3%: p = 0.0090), but not in the whole cohort (29.2% vs 25.8%: p = 0.5265) or pre-menopausal subgroup (37.0% vs 42.6%: p = 0.6231). In post-menopausal breast cancer cases, higher sPSA value was associated with clinic-pathological factors including the expression of AR protein in primary legion. In a correlation analysis of quantitative data limited to post-menopausal metastatic breast cancer (MBC), sPSA was positively, albeit weakly correlated with clinic-pathological features including serum testosterone levels and AR positivity.

Clinical and pathologic characteristics and biochemical recurrence (BCR)-free survival were compared between familial PCa and sporadic PCa in patients who underwent radical prostatectomy (RP; n = 751).  Results:   The prevalence of familial, first-degree familial, and hereditary PCa was found to be 8.4%, 6.7%, and 0.9%, respectively; similar result was obtained in patients who underwent RP (8.4%, 6.4%, and 0.9%). Patients with familial PCa were significantly younger than those with sporadic PCa (63.3 vs 65.6 years; P = .015). However, preoperative variables (prostate-specific antigen, clinical stage, biopsy Gleason score [GS], and percentage of positive biopsy cores) and postoperative variables (surgical GS, upgrading rate, pathologic stage, and percentage of tumor volume) did not correlate with family history (P range: .114-.982). Kaplan-Meier analysis of 5-year BCR-free survival revealed no significant difference between sporadic (82.7%), familial (89.4%; P = .594), and first-degree familial (87.1%; P = .774) PCa. Analysis of p53, Bcl-2, Ki67, and other immunohistochemistry biomarkers revealed that only increasing p53 expression and first-degree familial PCa approached significance (P = .059).  Conclusion:   The prevalence of familial PCa was somewhat lower in the Asian population than in other ethnic groups.

However, CRC screening rates are lower among Korean Americans than the general U.S. population. To understand barriers to screening in this population, we conducted 11 focus groups with 51 Korean Americans ages 40+ in the Washington, DC, metropolitan area between 2011 and 2016. Our analysis used the Health Belief Model as a framework. Motivators to seek screening include a family or personal history of cancer or gastrointestinal disease (high perceived susceptibility), knowing people with CRC (high severity), favorable test results reducing worry (high benefits), and physician recommendations (cues to action). Barriers to screening include the common misperception that Korean lifestyles prevent CRC (low susceptibility), the belief that cancer is normal for older adults (low severity), the assumption that screening only benefits symptomatic people (low benefits), the costs and potential risks of testing along with a preference for traditional Korean approaches to wellness (high barriers), and lack of health insurance (low self-efficacy). Interventions seeking to increase the rate of cancer screening in the Korean American community will benefit from emphasizing the burden from CRC among Korean Americans (increasing perceived susceptibility to CRC), explaining that colonoscopies can prevent CRC rather than just diagnosing it (increasing perceived benefits of screening), reducing anxieties about test procedures and embarrassment (reducing perceived barriers to screening), and improving clinical communication (improving cues to action and self-efficacy).""","""['Kyeung Mi Oh', 'Byeonghwa Park', 'Kathryn H Jacobsen']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""J Cancer Educ""","""['The Influence of Asian Subgroup and Acculturation on Colorectal Cancer Screening Knowledge and Attitudes Among Chinese and Korean Americans.', 'Knowledge of colorectal cancer screening guidelines and intention to obtain screening among nonadherent Filipino, Hmong, and Korean Americans.', 'Lay health educators and print materials for the promotion of colorectal cancer screening among Korean Americans: A randomized comparative effectiveness study.', 'Colorectal cancer screening among Asian Americans.', 'Explaining persistent under-use of colonoscopic cancer screening in African Americans: a systematic review.', 'Mammogram Uptake among Korean American Women in the South: Do Health Beliefs Matter?', 'Fatalism and metaphor in Confucianism: A qualitative study of barriers to genetic testing among first-degree relatives of hereditary cancer patients from China.', 'Barriers to Colorectal Cancer Screening in US Immigrants: A Scoping Review.', 'Psychological distance: a qualitative study of screening barriers among first-degree relatives of colorectal cancer patients.']"""

Neuropilins-1/-2 (NRP1, NRP2) are receptors for semaphorins and angiogenic growth factors, while the GAIP interacting protein C-terminus 1 (GIPC1, aka Synectin) interacts with the neuropilins. They are overexpressed in PDAC and associated with poor survival as well as tumor-promoting activities. Thus, neuropilin and/or GIPC1 silencing may inhibit PDAC growth. In this study, we directly compare the various tumor-inhibitory effects of transient RNAi-mediated depletion of NRP1, NRP2 and GIPC1, alone or in combination, in a set of cell lines with different expression levels. Inhibition of anchorage-dependent and -independent proliferation, colony formation and cell migration, alterations of 3D-spheroid size and shape as well as retardation of cell cycle and induction of apoptosis have been analyzed and found to vary between cell lines. The observed effects are independent of initial expression levels. Knocking down NRP1, NRP2, and GIPC1 alone demonstrates significant effects.

Summary of background data:   RALP has become the dominant surgical approach for localized disease in the absence of randomized clinical evidence and despite of the factor that RALP is more expensive than ORP.  Methods:   We performed a cohort study involving patients who underwent RALP and ORP for localized prostate cancer at the Commission on Cancer- accredited hospitals in the United States. Overall survival was analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method, log-rank test, Cox proportional hazards models, and propensity score-matched analyses. An interrupted time-series analysis using the surveillance, epidemiology, and end results program database was also performed.  Results:   From 2010 to 2011, 37,645 patients received RALP and 12,655 patients received ORP. At a median follow-up of 60.7 months, RALP was associated with improved overall survival by both univariate [hazard ratio (HR), 0.69; P < 0.001] and multivariate analysis (HR, 0.76; P < 0.001) compared with ORP. Propensity score-matched analysis demonstrated improved 5-year all-cause mortality (3.9% vs 5.5%, HR, 0.73; P < 0.001) for RALP. The interrupted time-series analysis demonstrated the adoption of robotic surgery coincided with a systematic improvement in the 5-year cancer-specific survival rate of 0.17% (95% confidence interval, 0.06-0.25) per year after 2003 (P = 0.004 for change of trend), as compared to the time before adoption of RALP (1998-2003, annual percentage change, 0.01%; 95% confidence interval, -0.06 to 0.08). Sensitivity analysis suggested that the results from the interrupted time-series analysis were consistent with the improvement in the all-cause mortality demonstrated in the survival analysis (P = 0.87).  Conclusions:   In this epidemiologic analysis, RALP was associated with a small but statistically significant improvement in 5-year all-cause mortality compared to ORP for localized prostate cancer. This is the first time in the literature to report a survival benefit with RALP.

After initial therapy and total resection of GBM, 80% to 90% of recurrences occur at the surgical margins. Currently, limited data are available in the literature on the possible use of Ga-prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA-11) for diagnosis of recurrence in GBM patients. The aim was to assess the feasibility and potential of Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT as a diagnostic procedure in patients with histologically confirmed of GBM and suspected recurrent disease on MRI.  Results:   No radiopharmaceutical-related adverse events were noted. Characterization of recurrent disease with MRI included T2-weighted fast spin-echo images, fluid-attenuated inversion recovery and diffusion-weighted imaging sequences, and gadolinium enhanced T1-weighted images. Visual interpretation of PET showed increased accumulation of Ga-PSMA-11 in recurrent lesion detected by T1 contrast enhanced and diffusion-weighted imaging images in all patients with a median SUVmax of the tumor of 6.5 and an SUVmean of 3.5. The median tumor-to-background brain ratio and tumor-to-liver ratio obtained from Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT were 96.7 and 0.8, respectively.  Conclusions:   The extremely low background uptake in normal brain tissue and consequently high tumor-to-brain ratio make Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT highly promising for diagnosis of recurrent disease in GBM patients. Although PSMA expression in recurrent GBM also opens a potential way for targeted peptide therapy with α/β-emitters as well as for prediction of treatment with antiangiogenic agents, the low tumor-to-liver ratio observed in the majority of patients in this study suggests a limited role of radiolabeled PSMA ligands for targeted radionuclide therapy of recurrent GBM.""","""['Jolanta Kunikowska', 'Radosław Kuliński', 'Kristoff Muylle', 'Henryk Koziara', 'Leszek Królicki']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Clin Nucl Med""","""['More advantages in detecting bone and soft tissue metastases from prostate cancer using 18F-PSMA PET/CT.', 'Diagnostic Value of 68Ga PSMA-11 PET/CT Imaging of Brain Tumors-Preliminary Analysis.', 'Whole-Body Integrated 68GaPSMA-11-PET/MR Imaging in Patients with Recurrent Prostate Cancer: Comparison with Whole-Body PET/CT as the Standard of Reference.', 'PET/CT With 68Ga-PSMA in Prostate Cancer: Radiopharmaceutical Background and Clinical Implications.', 'The role of 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT scan in biochemical recurrence after primary treatment for prostate cancer: a systematic review of the literature.', 'Ga-68 Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen-HBED-CC Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography in Anaplastic Thyroid Carcinoma.', 'A Comparison of PET Tracers in Recurrent High-Grade Gliomas: A Systematic Review.', 'PSMA Expression in Solid Tumors beyond the Prostate Gland: Ready for Theranostic Applications?', '68GaGa-PSMA PET/MRI, histological PSMA expression and preliminary experience with 177LuLu-PSMA therapy in relapsing high-grade glioma.', 'PSMA Radioligand Uptake as a Biomarker of Neoangiogenesis in Solid Tumours: Diagnostic or Theragnostic Factor?']"""

Bystander effects of ionizing radiation are well established, but little is known about such effects in non-ionizing photodynamic therapy (PDT). Our previous studies revealed that several cancer cell types upregulate inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and nitric oxide (NO) after a moderate 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA)-based PDT challenge. The NO signaled for cell resistance to photokilling as well as greater growth, migration and invasion of surviving cells. Based on this work, we hypothesized that diffusible NO produced by PDT-targeted cells in a tumor might elicit pro-growth/migration responses in non-targeted bystander cells. In the present study, we tested this using a novel approach, in which ALA-PDT-targeted human cancer cells on culture dishes (prostate PC3, breast MDA-MB-231, glioma U87, or melanoma BLM) were initially segregated from non-targeted bystanders via impermeable silicone-rimmed rings. Several hours after LED irradiation, rings were removed, and both cell populations analyzed for various post-hν responses. For a moderate and uniform level of targeted cell killing by PDT (~25%), bystander proliferation and migration were both enhanced. Enhancement correlated with iNOS/NO upregulation in surviving targeted cells in the following order: PC3 > MDA-MB-231 > U87 > BLM. If occurring in an actual tumor PDT setting and not suppressed (e.g., by iNOS activity or transcription inhibitors), then such effects could compromise treatment efficacy or even stimulate disease progression if PDT's anti-tumor potency is not great enough.""","""['Jerzy Bazak', 'Witold Korytowski', 'Albert W Girotti']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Cancers (Basel)""","""['Enhanced aggressiveness of bystander cells in an anti-tumor photodynamic therapy model: Role of nitric oxide produced by targeted cells.', 'Bystander effects of nitric oxide in anti-tumor photodynamic therapy.', 'Upregulation of nitric oxide in tumor cells as a negative adaptation to photodynamic therapy.', 'Multiple Means by Which Nitric Oxide can Antagonize Photodynamic Therapy.', 'Modulation of the Anti-Tumor Efficacy of Photodynamic Therapy by Nitric Oxide.', 'Pro-Tumor Activity of Endogenous Nitric Oxide in Anti-Tumor Photodynamic Therapy: Recently Recognized Bystander Effects.', 'Understanding the Photodynamic Therapy Induced Bystander and Abscopal Effects: A Review.', 'Photodynamic Therapy as an Oxidative Anti-Tumor Modality: Negative Effects of Nitric Oxide on Treatment Efficacy.', 'Negative effects of tumor cell nitric oxide on anti-glioblastoma photodynamic therapy.', 'Astragalus polysaccharide inhibits radiation-induced bystander effects by regulating apoptosis in Bone Mesenchymal Stem Cells (BMSCs).']"""

While zebra fish (Danio rerio; Dr) FKBP52 contains all of the analogous domains and residues previously identified as critical for FKBP52 potentiation of receptor activity, it fails to potentiate activity. Thus, we used a cross-species comparative approach to assess the residues that are functionally critical for FKBP52 function. Random selection of gain-of-function DrFKBP52 mutants in Saccharomyces cerevisiae identified two critical residues, alanine 111 (A111) and threonine 157 (T157), for activation of receptor potentiation by DrFKBP52. In silico homology modeling suggests that alanine to valine substitution at position 111 in DrFKBP52 induces an open conformation of the proline-rich loop surface similar to that observed on human FKBP52, which may allow for sufficient surface area and increased hydrophobicity for interactions within the receptor-chaperone complex. A second mutation in the FKBP12-like domain 2 (FK2), threonine 157 to arginine (T157R), also enhanced potentiation, and the DrFKBP52-A111V/T157R double mutant potentiated receptor activity similar to human FKBP52.

This study aims to evaluate sensitivity of and variability between readers of prostate MRI outside specialized units with radical prostatectomy (RP) specimen as the reference standard.Materials and methods: Retrospective study comprising a consecutive cohort of all 97 men who underwent MRI and subsequent RP between January 2012 and December 2014 at a private hospital in Sweden. Three readers, blinded to clinical data, reviewed all images (including 11 extra prostate MRI to reduce bias). A tumour was considered detected if the overall PI-RADS v2 score was 3-5 and there was an approximate match (same or neighbouring sector) of tumour sector according to a 24 sector system used for both MRI and whole mount sections.Results: Detection rate for the index tumour ranged from 67 to 76%, if PI-RADS 3-5 lesions were considered positive and 54-66% if only PI-RADS score 4-5 tumours were included. Detection rate for aggressive tumours (GS ≥ 4 + 3) was higher; 83.1% for PI-RADS 3-5 and 79.2% for PI-RADS 4-5. The agreement between readers showed average [Formula: see text] values of 0.41 for PI-RADS score 3-5 and 0.51 for PI-RADS score 4-5.Conclusions: Prostate MRI evidenced a moderate detection rate for clinically significant PC with a rather large variability between readers.

Taxanes, such as docetaxel and cabazitaxel are utilized in standard treatment regimens for chemotherapy naïve castration-resistant PCa. However, tumors often develop resistance to taxane chemotherapeutics, highlighting a need to identify additional therapeutic targets. Fatty acid-binding protein 5 (FABP5) is an intracellular lipid carrier whose expression is upregulated in metastatic PCa and increases cell growth, invasion, and tumor formation. Here, we assessed whether FABP5 inhibitors synergize with semi-synthetic taxanes to induce cytotoxicity in vitro and attenuate tumor growth in vivo.  Methods:   PC3, DU-145, and 22Rv1 PCa cells were incubated with FABP5 inhibitors Stony Brook fatty acid-binding protein inhibitor 102 (SBFI-102) or SBFI-103 in the presence or absence of docetaxel or cabazitaxel, and cytotoxicity was evaluated using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5 diphenyl tetrazolium bromide assay. Cytotoxicity of SBFI-102 and SBFI-103 was also evaluated in noncancerous cells. For the in vivo studies, PC3 cells were subcutaneously implanted into BALB/c nude mice, which were subsequently treated with FABP5 inhibitors, docetaxel, or a combination of both.  Results:   SBFI-102 and SBFI-103 produced cytotoxicity in the PCa cells. Coincubation of the PCa cells with FABP5 inhibitors and docetaxel or cabazitaxel produced synergistic cytotoxic effects in vitro. Treatment of mice with FABP5 inhibitors reduced tumor growth and a combination of FABP5 inhibitors with a submaximal dose of docetaxel reduced tumor growth to a larger extent than treatment with each drug alone.  Conclusions:   FABP5 inhibitors increase the cytotoxic and tumor-suppressive effects of taxanes in PCa cells. The ability of these drugs to synergize could permit more efficacious antitumor activity while allowing for dosages of docetaxel or cabazitaxel to be lowered, potentially decreasing taxane-resistance.""","""['Gregory Carbonetti', 'Cynthia Converso', 'Timothy Clement', 'Changwei Wang', 'Lloyd C Trotman', 'Iwao Ojima', 'Martin Kaczocha']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Lack of combination effects of soy isoflavones and taxane chemotherapy of castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Cabazitaxel regimens inhibit the growth of prostate cancer cells and enhances the anti-tumor properties of PEDF with various efficacy and toxicity.', 'Molecular Mechanism Mediating Cytotoxic Activity of Cabazitaxel in Docetaxel-resistant Human Prostate Cancer Cells.', 'Preclinical profile of cabazitaxel.', 'Exploitation of the Androgen Receptor to Overcome Taxane Resistance in Advanced Prostate Cancer.', 'New insights into lipid metabolism and prostate cancer (Review).', 'Integrated analysis of single-cell and bulk RNA sequencing identifies a signature based on macrophage marker genes involved in prostate cancer prognosis and treatment responsiveness.', 'Lycorine induces apoptosis of acute myeloid leukemia cells and inhibits triglyceride production via binding and targeting FABP5.', 'The Biological Functions and Regulatory Mechanisms of Fatty Acid Binding Protein 5 in Various Diseases.', 'Lipid Metabolism and Epigenetics Crosstalk in Prostate Cancer.']"""

Transrectal (TR) biopsy is a regular modality, while transperineal (TP) biopsy is an alternative for the patients who display persistently high levels of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and thus have to undergo repeat biopsy. This study aimed to compare the cancer detection rates between TR and TP approaches and assess the post-bioptic complications of the two procedures. Besides, the feasibility of performing TP biopsies under local anesthesia was also evaluated.  Methods:   A total of 238 outpatient visits meeting the criteria for prostate cancer biopsy were enrolled for this study. They were divided into two groups: the TP group (n = 130) consists of patients destined to undergo local anesthetic TP biopsy; and the TR group (n = 108) contained those who received TR biopsy as comparison. Age, PSA level, digital rectal exam (DRE) finding, prostate volume, and biopsy core number were used as the parameters of the multivariable analyses. The comparable items included cancer detection rate, complication rate, admission rate and visual analog scale (VAS) score.  Results:   The cancer detection rates between TP and TR groups were quite comparable (45% v.s. 49%) (p = 0.492). However, the TP group, as compared to the TR group, had significantly lower incidence of infection-related complications (except epididymitis and prostatitis) that commonly occur after biopsies. None of the patients in the TP group were hospitalized due to the post-bioptic complications, whereas there was still a minor portion of those in the TR group (7.4%) requiring hospitalization after biopsy. Medians (25-75% quartiles) of visual analog scale (VAS) were 3 [3, 4] and 4 [3-5] respectively for the TP and TR procedures under local anesthesia, but no statistical significance existed between them (p = 0.085).  Conclusions:   Patients receiving TP biopsy are less likely to manifest infection-related complications. Therefore, TP biopsy is a more feasible local anesthetic approach for prostate cancer detection if there are concerns for infectious complications and/or the risk of general anesthesia.""","""['Guan-Lin Huang', 'Chih-Hsiung Kang', 'Wei-Ching Lee', 'Po-Hui Chiang']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""BMC Urol""","""['The eternal enigma in prostatic biopsy access route.', 'A retrospective comparison between transrectal and transperineal prostate biopsy in the detection of prostate cancer.', 'The results of transperineal versus transrectal prostate biopsy: a systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Direct comparison between transrectal and transperineal extended prostate biopsy for the detection of cancer.', ""Sepsis and 'superbugs': should we favour the transperineal over the transrectal approach for prostate biopsy?"", 'A cost-effective transperineal prostate biopsy method utilizes the original transrectal setting.', 'Pooled outcomes of performing freehand transperineal prostate biopsy with the PrecisionPoint Transperineal Access System.', 'Machine learning model for the prediction of prostate cancer in patients with low prostate-specific antigen levels: A multicenter retrospective analysis.', 'Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Stockholm 3 Testing Compared to PSA as the Primary Blood Test in the Prostate Cancer Diagnostic Pathway: A Decision Tree Approach.', 'Outpatient before inpatient treatment?-Reality of care and economic analysis for minor urological interventions in Germany between 2013 and 2018.']"""

This resulting data can be interpreted in terms related to metabolic flux. However, detection of a stable isotope in metabolites by mass spectrometry produces a profile of isotopologue peaks that requires deconvolution to ascertain the localization of isotope incorporation.  Results:   To aid the interpretation of the mass spectroscopy isotopologue profile, we have developed a moiety modeling framework for deconvoluting metabolite isotopologue profiles involving single and multiple isotope tracers. This moiety modeling framework provides facilities for moiety model representation, moiety model optimization, and moiety model selection. The moiety_modeling package was developed from the idea of metabolite decomposition into moiety units based on metabolic transformations, i.e. a moiety model. The SAGA-optimize package, solving a boundary-value inverse problem through a combined simulated annealing and genetic algorithm, was developed for model optimization. Additional optimization methods from the Python scipy library are utilized as well. Several forms of the Akaike information criterion and Bayesian information criterion are provided for selecting between moiety models. Moiety models and associated isotopologue data are defined in a JSONized format. By testing the moiety modeling framework on the timecourses of 13C isotopologue data for uridine diphosphate N-acetyl-D-glucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc) in human prostate cancer LnCaP-LN3 cells, we were able to confirm its robust performance in isotopologue deconvolution and moiety model selection.  Conclusions:   SAGA-optimize is a useful Python package for solving boundary-value inverse problems, and the moiety_modeling package is an easy-to-use tool for mass spectroscopy isotopologue profile deconvolution involving single and multiple isotope tracers.

It has been postulated that such species have mechanisms to defend themselves against developing cancer. Here, selected species have been tested for potential cytotoxicity against selected cancer cell lines.  Methods:   In this study, various species of vertebrates and invertebrates were procured including Columba livia, Gallus gallus domesticus, Varanus salvator, Cuora kamamora amboinensis, Reticulatus malayanus, Oreochromis mossambicus, Rattus rattus, American bullfrog, Donax sp., Polymesoda coaxans, Tenebrio molitor, Lumbricus terrestris, Blatta lateralis, Grammostola rosea, and Penaeus monodon. Species were dissected and their organ lysates/sera/haemolymph were prepared. Cytotoxicity assays were performed using Prostate Cancer cells (PC3), Henrietta Lacks cervical adenocarcinoma cells (HeLa) and human breast adenocarcinoma cells (MCF7) as well as human keratinized skin cells (Hacat), by measuring lactate dehydrogenase release as an indicator for cell death. Growth inhibition assays were performed to determine the effects on cancer cell proliferation. Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) was performed for molecular identification.  Results:   The results revealed that body lysates of Polymesoda coaxans demonstrated more than 99% growth inhibition of all cancer cell lines tested but not on normal Hacat cells. More importantly, the serum of M. reticulatus abolished growth and produced cytotoxicity. Hence these samples were subjected to Liquid Chromatography- Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), which detected 81 small molecules and putatively identified 20 molecules when matched against the METLIN database. Out of 1094 peptides, 21 peptides were identified, while 1074 peptides were categorized as novel peptides. Based on properties such as peptide amino acid composition, binary profile, dipeptide composition and pseudo-amino acid composition, 306 potential peptides were identified.

Management of this distress and risk is crucial for quality urological care.  Objective:   To identify risk indicators for poorer trajectories of psychological adjustment and health-related quality of life (QoL) after surgery for localised prostate cancer.  Design, setting, and participants:   Patients were newly diagnosed with localised prostate cancer scheduled for surgical treatment. Patients were assessed at baseline (pre-surgery) and 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, 12 months, and 24 months post-surgery.  Measurements:   Assessment measures included sociodemographics, domain-specific and health-related QoL, and psychological distress. Mixed effects regression models were used to analyse the data.  Results and limitations:   A total of 233 patients provided data for this analysis (Mage = 60 years, standard deviation [SD] = 4.02; MPSA = 7.37 ng/mL). At baseline, the prevalence of high psychological distress was 28% reducing to 21% at 24 months. Before treatment, younger age, more comorbidities, and worse bowel function were related to greater psychological distress; and younger age and better urinary, sexual, and bowel function were related to better health-related QoL. By contrast, for changes over time, only bowel function was important with better bowel function predicting decreasing psychological distress for men.  Conclusions:   Regular distress screening is indicated over the 24 months after surgery for localised prostate cancer.

These findings were similar when we restricted to cases with at least 2 years of follow-up and no major weight loss, suggesting that our findings are not due to reverse causality. In the present study, those with higher serum concentrations of DBP were at increased risk of RCC, in contrast to previously published findings. Further research is necessary to determine the true association between DBP and risk of RCC, and whether different DBP phenotypes may have different associations with risk of RCC.""","""['Tyler B Kratzer', 'Stephanie J Weinstein', 'Demetrius Albanes', 'Alison M Mondul']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Int J Cancer""","""['Vitamin D-binding protein, circulating vitamin D and risk of renal cell carcinoma.', 'Vitamin D-Binding Protein and Risk of Renal Cell Carcinoma in the Cancer Prevention Study-II Cohort.', 'Renal-cell carcinoma risk estimates based on participants in the prostate, lung, colorectal, and ovarian cancer screening trial and national lung screening trial.', 'Circulating levels of obesity-related markers and risk of renal cell carcinoma in the PLCO cancer screening trial.', 'Current evidence on screening for renal cancer.', 'Prediagnostic Serum Vitamin D, Vitamin D Binding Protein Isoforms, and Cancer Survival.', 'Effects of PICCO in the guidance of goal-directed fluid therapy for gastrointestinal function after cytoreductive surgery for ovarian cancer.']"""

Methods:   Interviews were conducted with 25 men recently diagnosed with mCRPC from the United States (US), France, and Germany. We also interviewed 14 PSPs. Thematic analysis was conducted using Atlas.ti.  Results:   The mean age of patients was 72.2 years; mean time since metastasis 7.8 months. The most frequent symptoms were fatigue/tiredness, sexual dysfunction, and pain. Metastasis had a negative emotional impact on the patient and PSP. Some explicitly associated certain symptoms/impacts with metastasis, such as localized pain, diarrhea, blood in stool, and increased impact on activities of daily living. About 72% of patients highlighted the emotional impact of a metastatic diagnosis, reporting worry/anxiety/fear, low mood/depression, shock, increased burden on PSP, and strain on relationships. Monitoring prostate-specific antigen (PSA) values was important; ten patients explicitly discussed feeling fear/worry when PSA was rising, and glad/happy/excited when PSA was falling. Most reported that, if a medication had been available to them to delay metastasis, they would have taken it, even if they were asymptomatic.  Conclusions:   Interviews highlighted the substantial burden of mCRPC to both patient and PSP. Development of metastasis was associated with symptoms worsening rather than the development of new symptoms, with physical and emotional impacts.

Patients, materials and methods:   433 fields with different patterns of PA selected from 83 patients with total prostatectomy according to Gleason and Srigley grading systems were selected. Four serial sections were cut and stained in order to assess the following parameters: tumor grading with Hematoxylin-Eosin (H-E), tumor cells architecture (GÖ) with Gömöri technique, tumor stroma architecture (TC) with Goldner's trichrome, and vascular network (VN) architecture with cluster of differentiation 34 (CD34) immunomarker. Images were binarized with variable user-defined empiric threshold for Goldner's trichrome staining and CD34 immunostaining and k-nearest neighbor approach for GÖ staining. The FD was computed for each binary image using a box-counting algorithm. The three computed values were used for clustering and classification, k-nearest neighbor proving to be a good choice with a classification rate, due to the irregular distribution of cases in different patterns. Values tending to ""1"" had the meaning of a more ""Linear type"" distribution and values tending to ""2"" had the meaning of a more ""Area type"" distribution.  Results:   Tumor cells architecture had a more ordered smooth ascending trend towards ""area-like"" type of distribution (with FD>1.5) in Srigley system than in Gleason system. Tumor stroma architecture had almost the same type of distribution - between ""linear-like"" and ""area-like"" (FD~1.5) - in both grading systems. VN architecture had a more ""linear-like"" type of distribution (FD<1.5), with a descending trend towards high-grade patterns in both systems. Tumor cells architecture had a direct correlation with tumor stroma architecture and VN architecture (p-value of Pearson's test <0.001), while tumor stroma architecture and VN architecture proved no correlation (p-value of Pearson's test >0.05), irrespective of grading pattern.  Conclusions:   Tumor cell population is remodeling and adapting TC and VN in the same way its architectural disposal evolves. TC and VN develop independently of each other, the former towards ""Area type"" and the latter towards ""Linear type"" of architectural disposal as the degree of differentiation is decreasing.

Therefore, a marker of response would be beneficial for clinical decision-making. We evaluated class III β-tubulin (βIII-tubulin) expression as a predictor of resistance in this setting, which previously has been correlated with lack of response to taxanes in other cancers. Patients with CRPC were included if they were treated with at least 3 cycles of docetaxel between 1990 and 2011. βIII-tubulin expression was assessed by immunostaining, which was performed in tissue samples obtained either via biopsy or prostatectomy at the time of diagnosis. Rates of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response and overall survival (OS) following docetaxel treatment were compared between patients with high (2+ or 3+ staining) vs. low (0 or 1+ staining) βIII-tubulin expression. Of 73 patients, 26 (35%) had a high expression of βIII-tubulin. A PSA decline of 10% or greater occurred in 65% of patients with a high βIII-tubulin expression vs. 89% with a low βIII-tubulin expression (p = 0.0267). The median OS for patients with a high βIII-tubulin expression was 17.4 (95% CI 8.7-21.0) months vs. 19.8 (95% CI 16.6-23.6) months for patients with a low expression (p = 0.039).

Lost expression of E-cadherin disrupts this complex resulting in loss of cell polarity, epithelial denudation and increased epithelial permeability in a variety of tissues. Decreased expression of E-cadherin has also been observed in invasive and metastatic human tumors. In this study, we investigated the effect of E-cadherin loss in prostatic epithelium using newly developed genetically engineered mouse models. Deletion of E-cadherin in prostatic luminal epithelial cells with modified probasin promoter driven Cre (PB-Cre4) induced the development of mouse prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN). An increase in levels of cytoplasmic and nuclear β-catenin appeared in E-cadherin deleted atypical cells within PIN lesions. Using various experimental approaches, we further demonstrated that the knockdown of E-cadherin expression elevated free cytoplasmic and nuclear β-catenin and enhanced androgen-induced transcription and cell growth. Intriguingly, pathological changes representing prostatic epithelial cell denudation and increased apoptosis accompanied the above PIN lesions. The essential role of E-cadherin in maintaining prostatic epithelial integrity and organization was further demonstrated using organoid culture approaches. To directly assess the role of loss of E-cadherin in prostate tumor progression, we generated a new mouse model with bigenic Cdh1 and Pten deletion in prostate epithelium. Early onset, aggressive tumor phenotypes presented in the compound mice. Strikingly, goblet cell metaplasia was observed, intermixed within prostatic tumor lesions of the compound mice.
