IL-8 and VEGF plasma levels correlate with prostate cancer severity, suggesting that therapeutic options aimed at their downregulation may modulate tumor growth. Available data suggest that Agaricus bisporus (white button mushroom [WBM]) extracts inhibit cancer cell proliferation through aromatase inhibition. However, the extent to which they affect IL-8 and VEGF remains to be elucidated. The aims of this study were to (1) investigate the antiproliferative properties of WBM, brown A. bisporus (portabella), and Lentinus edodes (shiitake mushroom) on PC3 cancer cells; (2) demonstrate that these properties are exerted through the regulation of both IL-8 and VEGF; and (3) determine the role of NFκB activation in the antiproliferative process of mushroom extracts. Cytokine secretion in the supernatant, NFκB activity, and cell proliferation were measured in PC3 cells incubated with 0-100 µg/mL of ethanol extracts of mushrooms. Mushroom extracts decreased IL-8 secretion and cell proliferation (P < .05), and also tended to decrease VEGF (P < .09). Decreased cell proliferation did not appear to result from cell death because trypan blue exclusion tests showed comparable cell viability among cultures. Mushroom extracts also decreased nuclear and total NFκB activity, and the ratio of nuclear to cytoplasmic activity (P < .05) suggesting altered translocation from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. Our data suggest that the three types of studied mushrooms may modulate tumor growth through inhibition of IL-8, VEGF, and NFκB pathways.""","""['Christine French', 'Chandra Lc', 'Stephen L Clarke', 'Edralin A Lucas', 'Brenda J Smith', 'Stanley Lightfoot', 'Solo R Kuvibidila']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Int J Med Mushrooms""","""['White button, portabella, and shiitake mushroom supplementation up-regulates interleukin-23 secretion in acute dextran sodium sulfate colitis C57BL/6 mice and murine macrophage J.744.1 cell line.', 'In vitro effects of plant and mushroom extracts on immunological function of chicken lymphocytes and macrophages.', 'Effect of UV-B exposure on the concentration of vitamin D2 in sliced shiitake mushroom (Lentinus edodes) and white button mushroom (Agaricus bisporus).', 'Mushroom extracts and compounds with suppressive action on breast cancer: evidence from studies using cultured cancer cells, tumor-bearing animals, and clinical trials.', 'Role of Mushroom as Dietary Supplement on Performance of Poultry.', 'Combining the Anticancer and Immunomodulatory Effects of Astragalus and Shiitake as an Integrated Therapeutic Approach.']"""

Currently, preventative screenings for these conditions are restricted to high-risk populations and extremely expensive. The discovery of clinically indicative biomarkers has been revolutionary in advancing screening and diagnostic capabilities. Prostate-specific antigen (PSA), an extracellular secreted protein of the prostate gland, and neuron-specific enolase (NSE), an enzyme of neuronal origin, have reported reputable specificity for prostate cancer and small cell lung cancer (SCLC). Current efforts are underway to develop a rapid, label-free means of measuring both PSA and NSE levels in a clinical environment for early screening applications of highly metastatic cancers. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and impedance time (Z-t) are rapid, sensitive electrochemical techniques previously validated in the detection of several clinically relevant biomarkers, including cardiovascular disease and diabetes mellitus. Herein, we determine the optimal frequencies of PSA (81.38 Hz) and NSE (14.36 Hz) using EIS that are robust across analytical platforms and in the presence of potentially interfering species. The reported empirical evidence supports the prevalence of electrostatic interactions in electrochemical systems and provides alternative theoretical support of previous findings. Finally, Z-t was implemented for its utility in continuous monitoring applications and to lay the foundation for future improvements to continuous sensor platforms.""","""['Mackenzie M Honikel', 'Jeffrey T La Belle']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Crit Rev Biomed Eng""","""['Prediction of lung cancer based on serum biomarkers by gene expression programming methods.', 'High Serum Neuron-Specific Enolase (NSE) Level Firstly Ignored as Normal Reaction in a Small Cell Lung Cancer Patient: a Case Report and Literature Review.', 'Clinical utility of haptoglobin in combination with CEA, NSE and CYFRA21-1 for diagnosis of lung cancer.', 'Pretreatment serum level of neuron specific enolase (NSE) as a prognostic factor in metastatic prostate cancer patients treated with endocrine therapy.', 'Recent advances in biosensor for detection of lung cancer biomarkers.', 'Multisensor Systems and Arrays for Medical Applications Employing Naturally-Occurring Compounds and Materials.']"""

Methods:   Inclusion criteria were men aged 50-75 years, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) ≤15 ng/mL, clinical stage T1c-T2a, one or two lesions (PI-RADS ≥3) on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and Gleason score 6 (>3 mm) or Gleason 7 on targeted biopsy. Treatment success was defined as no clinically significant cancer in ablated areas. The study is prospective. Under MRI guidance, laser ablation was applied to the visible lesion(s). International Prostate Symptoms Score, Sexual Health Inventory in Men score and PSA levels were assessed at baseline and repeated at 1, 3, 6, 12 and 18 months. MRI was repeated at 3 and 12 months. Cancer control was assessed at 6 months using targeted and systematic biopsies.  Results:   FLA was performed in 49 patients. Gleason scores were 3 + 3 in 13 patients (26.5%), 3 + 4 in 29 (59.2%) and 4 + 3 in 7 (14.3%). No significant complications were noticed. International Prostate Symptoms Score measurements up to 18 months were not different from baseline (all P > 0.05). Sexual Health Inventory in Men scores dropped in the first year (all P < 0.05), but were not different from baseline levels at 18 months (P = 0.097). PSA levels dropped significantly at 3-18 months (all P < 0.05). Treatment was successful in 39 patients (79.6%). Persistent cancer in treated areas was found in 10 patients (20.4%).  Conclusions:   FLA is safe with no impact on urinary and sexual functions at 18 months follow-up. Oncologic control is encouraging.

Previous data on perioperative complication rates of RALRP in HIV(+) patients are limited by small sample size.  Methods:   The National Inpatient Sample database from 2008 to 2014 was used to query prostate cancer patients who underwent RALRP. HIV(+) patients were identified through ICD9 codes 042, 043, 044, V08 and 079.53. Intraoperative and postoperative complications, rate of blood transfusion, in-hospital mortality, prolonged length of stay and total cost were compared by univariate, multivariate regression and 1:4 propensity score matched analyses.  Results:   Overall, 270,319 weighted patients undergoing RALRP were identified, among whom 546 (0.20%) patients were diagnosed with HIV. Patients with HIV were younger, less likely to be white and had more comorbidities. Multivariable regression analysis revealed that HIV(+) patients had significantly increased genitourinary complications (odds ratio [OR]: 3.31; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.03-10.68) and miscellaneous surgical events (OR 3.19; 95% CI 1.26-8.08). There were no differences in potentially life-threatening cardiac, respiratory and vascular events between patients with and without HIV after RALRP. Propensity score matched analysis yielded similar results.  Conclusions:   Our findings suggest that patients who underwent RALRP with HIV did not experience higher risk of potentially life-threatening postoperative complications.

Report from a Multidisciplinary Expert Panel Meeting""","""Introduction:   Pelvic lymphadenectomy (pLA) in prostate cancer (PCa) is one of the most common uro-oncologic surgical procedures. An increased complication rate is accompanied by unproven oncologic benefit. Extent of pLA and mechanisms of metastasis are discussed controversially. We aimed to explore evidence and knowledge gaps in pLA and mechanisms of metastasis in PCa and to develop further steps to clarify oncologic benefits through an expert panel.  Methods:   A multidisciplinary expert meeting was initiated, compiling available facts on pLA and mechanisms of metastasis in PCa. Questions and hypotheses were formulated. The resulting protocol was modeled on priority and consistency in four anonymized voting rounds using the Delphi method (March 2018-June 2018).  Results:   The oncologic benefit of pLA in PCa is still unclear. Results of randomized trials (RCTs) are pending. Extent and techniques of pLA are differently applied and inconsistently recommended by the guidelines as well as the indication for pLA. Different growth rates for the primaries and metastases and different survival curves for lymph node and organ metastasis at diagnosis argue against metastasis originating from positive nodes. However, results from clinical and basic research support this opportunity in PCa.  Conclusions:   The RCTs required to clarify the estimated low oncologic benefit of pLA prove to be difficult because of the great effort (e.g., high case number). Establishing a network of treatment centers for implementation of high-quality cohort studies could be an alternative approach. Future studies with larger panels and international participants based on the presented feasibility should be launched to set this process in motion. Until valid data are available, benefits and harms of pLA should be weighted under consideration of low-invasive techniques (e.g., sentinel pLA).""","""['Alexander Winter', 'Rolf Harzmann', 'Johann Jakob Wendler', 'Christiane Roloff', 'Steffen Weikert', 'Lothar Weissbach']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Adv Ther""","""['Pelvic lymph node dissection in prostate cancer.', 'Current controversies on the role of lymphadenectomy for prostate cancer.', 'The Benefits and Harms of Different Extents of Lymph Node Dissection During Radical Prostatectomy for Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Review.', 'Anatomical extent of pelvic lymphadenectomy in patients undergoing radical prostatectomy.', 'Extent of Lymphadenectomy at Time of Prostatectomy: An Evidence-Based Approach.']"""

Key components of this technique include use of the PrecisionPoint Transperineal Access System (Perineologic, Cumberland, MD) and simultaneous transrectal ultrasound guidance in the axial and sagittal planes.  Patients and methods:   In total, 95 patients (38 studied retrospectively and 57 studied prospectively) underwent a transperineal MRI-targeted prostate biopsy using the technique detailed in this manuscript. All biopsies were performed by a single urologist (MAG). Data were collected with respect to cancer detection rates, tolerability, and complications. The subset of patients who were studied prospectively was assessed for complications by telephone interviews performed at 4-6 days and 25-31 days following the prostate biopsy.  Results:   Between February 2018 and June 2019, 95 men underwent a transperineal prostate biopsy using MRI/biplanar ultrasound fusion guidance. Patients had a total of 124 PI-RADS 3-5 lesions that were targeted for biopsy. In total, 108 (87.1%) lesions were found to harbor prostate cancer of any grade. Grade group ≥ 2 prostate cancer was found in 81 (65.3%) of targeted lesions. The detection rates for grade group ≥ 1 and grade group ≥ 2 prostate cancer rose with increasing PI-RADS score. In 65 (68.4%) cases, the patient's highest grade prostate cancer was found within an MRI target. Additionally, 12 of 55 (21.8%) patients who were found to have no or grade group 1 prostate cancer on systematic biopsy were upgraded to grade group ≥ 2 prostate cancer with MRI targeting. Only 1 (1.1%) patient received periprocedural antibiotics and no patient experienced an infectious complication. Self-limited hematuria and hematospermia were commonly reported following the procedure (75.4% and 40.4%, respectively) and only 1 (1.1%) patient developed urinary retention.  Conclusions:   We demonstrate the safety and feasibility of performing transperineal prostate biopsy using cognitive MRI/biplanar ultrasound fusion guidance. The described technique affords the safety benefits of the transperineal approach as well as obviates the need for a formal fusion platform. Additionally, this method can conveniently be performed under local anesthesia with acceptable tolerability.""","""['Michael A Gorin', 'Alexa R Meyer', 'Michael Zimmerman', 'Rana Harb', 'Gregory A Joice', 'Zeyad R Schwen', 'Mohamad E Allaf']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""World J Urol""","""['Robot-assisted Magnetic Resonance Imaging-ultrasound Fusion Transperineal Targeted Biopsy.', 'Initial Experience Performing In-office Ultrasound-guided Transperineal Prostate Biopsy Under Local Anesthesia Using the PrecisionPoint Transperineal Access System.', 'In-office Transperineal Prostate Biopsy Using Biplanar Ultrasound Guidance: A Step-by-Step Guide.', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging/Ultrasound Fusion-guided Transperineal Versus Magnetic Resonance Imaging/Ultrasound Fusion-guided Transrectal Prostate Biopsy-A Systematic Review.', 'Magnetic resonance imaging-transrectal ultrasound fusion image-guided prostate biopsy: Current status of the cancer detection and the prospects of tailor-made medicine of the prostate cancer.', 'Transperineal Prostate Biopsy Targeted by Magnetic Resonance Imaging Cognitive Fusion.', 'Transrectal vs. transperineal fusion biopsy of the prostate : Time to switch to the perineal technique-comparison of methods and description of the transperineal procedure under local anesthesia.', 'Landmarks in the evolution of prostate biopsy.', 'Recent advances of multimoda ultrasound in image-guided prostate-targeted biopsy.', 'Pooled outcomes of performing freehand transperineal prostate biopsy with the PrecisionPoint Transperineal Access System.']"""

Considering features of natural fatty acids, such as biocompatibility, biodegradability and their increased cellular uptake by cancer cells, it seems that combining them with a drug could improve its bioavailability, and thus cytotoxicity. Therefore, the aim of this study was coupling of CP with saturated and unsaturated fatty acids, and evaluation of their cytotoxicity, apoptosis-inducing effects and inhibition of IL-6 release in human primary (SW480) and metastatic (SW620) colon cancer, metastatic prostate cancer (PC3) and normal (HaCaT) cell lines. The PC3 cell line was the most sensitive to the presence of the obtained conjugates. The value of IC50 for oleic acid conjugate (4) was 7.7 μM, and it was 12 times lower than for CP alone (101.4 μM). The studied derivatives induced late apoptosis in all cancer cell lines, but not in normal cells. The most potent apoptosis inducer was conjugate 4, that resulted in the highest percentage of PC3 cells in late apoptosis (81.5% ± 3.9), followed by elaidic acid amide 5 (75% ± 4.8). The strongest pro-apoptic effects on SW480 cells were demonstrated by conjugates of DHA (8) and sorbic (2) acids, whereas in SW620 cell lines, compounds 2 and 5 appeared to be the most effective. To establish the mechanism of cytotoxic action of derivatives 2, 4, 5, the level of interleukin-6 (IL-6) was measured. The compounds with the highest cytotoxic potential significantly decreased the release of IL-6 by cancer cells. Additionally, all conjugates were evaluated for their in vitro antimicrobial activity. Short chain amides - crotonic (1) and sorbic (2) - were the most active against Staphyloccoci.

This nanocarrier was further loaded with curcumin (Cur), and characterized as a nanocarrier for anti-cancer drug delivery. The synthesized nanocarriers contain two different pH-sensitive amide linkages, which are negatively charged in blood pH (≈7.4) and can prolong circulation times. The amide linkages undergo hydrolysis once they reach the mildly acidic condition (pH≈6.5, corresponding to tumor extracellular matrix), and subsequently once reached the lower acidic condition (pH≈5.5, corresponded to endo/lysosomes microenvironment), the FPS charge can be switched to positive (≈+28 mV), which aids the nuclear release. This nanocarrier was designed to selectively enhance cell internalization and nuclear-targeted delivery of curcumin in HeLa, SkBr3 and PC-3 cancer cells. Moreover, FPS-Cur demonstrated high curcumin loading capacity, prolonged curcumin release and promotion of apoptosis in HeLa, SkBr3 and PC-3 cells.

However, their role in suppressing the interactions between TAMs and cancer cells remain unclear. Herein, we studied the impact of human monocytes conditioned media (CM) on cellular proliferation of ER-dependent MCF-7 and ER-independent MDA-MB-231 cells, and the effects of piroxicam and sulindac sulfide on the expression levels of RAS, COX-2, IL-6, IL-1β and PAR-4 (qRT-PCR), BCL-2 and BAX (western blot), Caspase-3, VEGF-a and PGE2 (ELISA), MMP-2 and -9 (zymography) in the stimulated cells. Our results showed that CM caused a significant increase in cells survival through significant increase in RAS expression which resulted in upregulation of COX-2, PGE2, BCL-2, IL-6, IL-1β, VEGF-A and MMP-9 and down regulation of PAR-4. Treatment with one of the NSAIDs used in this study produced a time and concentration dependent growth inhibition of stimulated cells by inhibiting RAS expression. Suppression of RAS was accompanied by downregulation of its downstream signaling of IL-1β, IL-6, COX-2 and PGE2, activation of apoptotic machinery through upregulation of PAR-4 and caspase-3, as well as, inhibition of BCL-2, VEGF-A, MMP-2 and MMP-9.

Methods and materials:   Clinical KBP automated planning routines were developed for prostate, prostatic fossa, hypofractionated lung, and head and neck. Clinical implementation consisted of independent generation of human-generated and KBP plans (145 cases across all sites), followed by blinded plan selection. Reviewing physicians were prompted to select a single plan; when plan equivalence was volunteered, this scored as KBP selection. Plan selection analysis used a noninferiority framework testing the hypothesis that KBP is not worse than human-driven planning (threshold: lower 95% confidence interval [CI] > 0.45 = noninferiority; > 0.5 = superiority). Target and organ-at-risk metrics were compared by dose differencing: ΔDx = Dx, human-Dx, KBP (2-tailed paired t test, Bonferroni-corrected P < .05 significance threshold). To evaluate the aggregated effect of KBP on planning performance, we examined post-KBP dosimetric parameters against 183 plans generated just before KBP implementation (2-tailed unpaired t test, Bonferroni-corrected P < .05).  Results:   Across all disease sites, the KBP success rate (physician preferred + equivalent) was noninferior compared with human-driven planning (83 of 145 = 57.2%; range, 49.2%-65.3%) but did not cross the threshold for superiority. The KBP success rate in respective disease sites was superior with head and neck ([22 + 2]/36 = 66.7%; 95% CI, 51%-82%) and noninferior for lung stereotactic body radiation therapy ([21 + 2]/36 = 63.9%; 95% CI, 48%-80%) but did not meet noninferiority criteria with prostate ([16 + 3]/41 = 46.3%; 95% CI, 31%-62%) or prostatic fossa ([17 + 0]/32 = 53.1%; 95% CI, 36%-70%). Prostate, prostatic fossa, and head and neck showed significant differences in KBP-selected plans versus human-selected plans, with KBP generally exhibiting greater organ-at-risk sparing and human plans exhibiting better target homogeneity. Analysis of plan quality pre- and post-KBP showed some reductions in organ doses and quality metric variability in prostate and head and neck.

The main adverse effect of abiraterone is the disruption of corticosteroid biosynthesis, and the more pharmacologically active abiraterone D4A metabolite may have the same issues. We therefore estimated the inhibiting impact of the abiraterone D4A metabolite on one of the key corticosteroidogenic enzymes - human steroid 21-monooxygenase (CYP21A2). Molecular docking of D4A into the active site of CYP21A2 has been predicted to be similar to abiraterone binding with the enzyme. Abiraterone D4A metabolite, similar to abiraterone, induces type II spectral changes of CYP21A2. The spectral dissociation constant for the abiraterone D4A metabolite-CYP21A2 complex was calculated as 3.4 ± 0.5 μM. Abiraterone D4A metabolite demonstrates competitive/mixed type CYP21A2 inhibition with an inhibitory constant of 1.8 ± 0.8 μM, as obtained by Dixon plot.

Methods:   State alcohol policy restrictiveness, as measured by a validated policy scale, were related to state rates of six alcohol attributable cancers in the U.S. from 2006 to 2010 in a lagged, cross-sectional linear regression that controlled for a variety of state-level factors. Cancer mortality rates were from the Center for Disease Control and Prevention's Alcohol-Related Disease Impact application, which uses population-attributable fraction methodology to calculate mortality from cancers of the esophagus, larynx, liver, oropharynx, prostate (male only) and breast (female only).  Results:   More restrictive state alcohol policies were associated with lower cancer mortality rates for the six cancer types overall (beta [β] -0.33; 95% confidence interval [CI] -0.59, -0.07), and among men (β -0.45; 95% CI -0.81, -0.10) and women (β -0.21; 95% CI -0.40, -0.02). A 10% increase in the restrictiveness of alcohol policies (based on the mean APS among states) was associated with an 8.5% decrease in rates of combined alcohol-attributable cancers. In all analyses stratified by cancer subtype and sex, the associations were in the hypothesized direction (i.e., more restrictive state policy environments were associated with lower rates of alcohol-attributable cancers), with the exception of laryngeal cancer among women.

TB (mean core number, 2.4±0.6; range, 2-4) was performed by a single experienced radiologist under cognitive registration between prebiopsy MRI and TRUS. Tumour echogenicity on TRUS and Prostate Imaging-Reporting and Data System version 2 (PI-RADSv2) scoring on MRI for targeted TZ lesions were assessed. The interrupted midline sign was defined as a focal lesion traversing the midline of the TZ leading to discontinuity of the midline on both MRI and TRUS. TZ PCa with a Gleason score of 7 or greater was defined as clinically significant PCa (csPCa).  Results:   The cancer detection rate of TRUS-guided TB for TZ lesions was 78.9% (30/38) for any PCa and 42.1% (16/38) for csPCa.

Typically, CARs contain a single-chain variable domain fragment (scFv). Most often, scfvs are derived from a monoclonal antibody of murine origin and may be a trigger for host immune system that leads to the T-cell clearance. Nanobody is a specific antigen-binding fragment derived from camelid that has great homology to human VH and low immunogenic potential. Therefore, in this study, nanobody was employed instead of scFv in CAR construct.  Methods:   In this study, a CAR was constructed based on a nanobody against PSMA (NBPII-CAR). At first, Jurkat cells were electroporated with NBPII-CAR, and then flow cytometry was performed for NBPII-CAR expression. For functional analysis, CAR T cells were co-cultured with prostate cancer cells and analyzed for IL-2 secretion, CD25 expression, and cell proliferation.  Results:   Flow cytometry results confirmed the expression of NBPII-CAR on the transfected Jurkat cells. Our data showed the specificity of engineered Jurkat cells against prostate cancer cells by not only increasing the IL-2 cytokine (about 370 pg/ml) but also expressing the T-cell activation marker CD25 (about 30%). In addition, proliferation of engineered Jurkat cells increased nearly 60% when co-cultured with LNCaP (PSMA+), as compared with DU145 (PSMA-).  Conclusion:   Here, we describe the ability of nanobody-based CAR to recognize PSMA that leads to the activation of Jurkat cells.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the predictive value of PSMA PET for a 3-y freedom from progression (FFP) in men with BCR after RP undergoing salvage radiotherapy (sRT). Methods: This prospective multicenter study enrolled 260 men between 2015 and 2017. Eligible patients were referred for PSMA PET with a rising level of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) after RP. Management after PSMA PET was recorded but not mandated. PSMA PET protocols were standardized across sites and reported prospectively. Clinical, pathologic, and surgical information; sRT; timing and duration of androgen deprivation; 3-y PSA results; and clinical events were documented. FFP was defined as a PSA rise of no more than 0.2 ng/mL above nadir after sRT, with no additional treatment. Results: The median PSA was 0.26 ng/mL (interquartile range, 0.15-0.59 ng/mL), and follow-up was 38 mo (interquartile range, 31-43 mo). PSMA PET had negative results in 34.6% (90/260), showed disease confined to the prostatic fossa in 21.5% (56/260), showed disease in the pelvic nodes in 26.2% (68/260), and showed distant disease in 17.7% (46/260). Of the patients, 71.5% (186/260) received sRT: 38.2% (71/186) to the fossa only, 49.4% (92/186) to the fossa plus the pelvic nodes, and 12.4% (23/186) to the nodes alone or stereotactic body radiation therapy. PSMA PET was highly predictive of FFP at 3 y after sRT. Overall, FFP was achieved in 64.5% (120/186) of those who received sRT, 81% (81/100) with negative results or fossa-confined findings versus 45% (39/86) with extrafossa disease (P < 0.0001). On logistic regression, PSMA PET was more independently predictive of FFP than established clinical predictors, including PSA, T stage, surgical margin status, or Gleason score (P < 0.002). Thirty-two percent of men with a negative PSMA PET result did not receive treatment. Of these, 66% (19/29) progressed, with a mean rise in PSA of 1.59 ng/mL over the 3 y. Conclusion: PSMA PET results are highly predictive of FFP at 3 y in men undergoing sRT for BCR after RP. In particular, men with negative PSMA PET results or disease identified as still confined to the prostatic fossa demonstrate high FFP, despite receiving less extensive radiotherapy and lower rates of additional androgen deprivation therapy than those with extrafossa disease.""","""['Louise Emmett', 'Reuben Tang', 'Rohan Nandurkar', 'George Hruby', 'Paul Roach', 'Jo Anne Watts', 'Thomas Cusick', 'Andrew Kneebone', 'Bao Ho', 'Lyn Chan', 'Pim J van Leeuwen', 'Matthijs J Scheltema', 'Andrew Nguyen', 'Charlotte Yin', 'Andrew Scott', 'Colin Tang', 'Michael McCarthy', 'Karen Fullard', 'Matthew Roberts', 'Roslyn Francis', 'Phillip Stricker']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""J Nucl Med""","""['Re: 3-Year Freedom from Progression following 68GaPSMA PET CT Triaged Management in Men with Biochemical Recurrence Post Radical Prostatectomy.

In our study, we assessed the antitumoral activities of novel ruthenium complexes coupled to the amino acids proline (RuPro) and threonine (RuThr) in prostate tumor cell lines (DU145) and breast (MCF7), and normal cell lines of the lung fibroblast (GM07492A). Our results revealed that the EC50 of the complexes for DU145 and MCF7 was two times lower than that GM07492A. Moreover, RuPro and RuThr were not able to induce significant genomic instability, cell cycle arrest or cell death in GM07492A, but could induce DNA damage, arrest in G2/M and apoptosis in DU145 and MCF7. Furthermore, BAX, TP53 and ATM were found to be upregulated in DU145 and MCF7 treated with RuPro and RuThr, in which, a higher ASCT2 gene expression was also observed.

Objective:   To perform a highly sensitive assay for detecting AR-V7 (hsAR-V7) in circulating tumor cells (CTCs) and evaluate its ability to predict response to ARS inhibitors.  Design, setting, and participants:   From 41 mCRPC patients, CTCs were prospectively enriched using AdnaTest platform and analyzed for AR-V7 with and without the highly sensitive assay.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   The first objective of the study was to compare AR-V7 detection rates with and without the highly sensitive assay. Next, we investigated how AR-V7 (detected without the highly sensitive assay) and hsAR-V7 status influenced prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response and long-term clinical outcomes (PSA progression-free survival [PFS] and radiological PFS) after ARS-inhibitor treatment. Finally, discriminatory abilities of the assays were assessed by C-index to compare their impact on long-term clinical outcomes.  Results and limitations:   AR-V7 detection rates increased from 22% to 56% when the highly sensitive assay was used. The discriminatory abilities of hsAR-V7 for PSA PFS (C-index, 0.74; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.60-0.88) and radiological PFS (0.70; 95% CI, 0.55-0.85) were higher than those of AR-V7 detected without the highly sensitive assay (0.60, 0.51-0.72, and 0.56, 0.44-0.67, respectively). After ARS-inhibitor treatment, PSA response was lower in hsAR-V7+ (53%) than in hsAR-V7- (93%) patients (p = 0.016). AR-V7+ patients had shorter median PSA PFS (3.0 vs 10.6 mo, p = 0.032) and nonsignificantly shorter median radiological PFS (6.0 vs 14.8 mo, p = 0.24) compared with AR-V7- patients. The hsAR-V7+ status was associated with shorter median PSA PFS (3.0 mo vs not reached, p = 0.0001) and radiological PFS (median, 6.0 mo vs not reached, p = 0.0026).  Conclusions:   The hsAR-V7 assay achieved the highest AR-V7 detection rates among those reported in mCRPC. Discriminatory abilities for long-term clinical outcomes were better with hsAR-V7 assay.  Patient summary:   We prospectively analyzed circulating tumor cells from men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer for androgen receptor splice variant 7 (AR-V7) status using a highly sensitive assay. It yielded higher AR-V7 detection rates and predicted resistance to androgen receptor signaling inhibitors with better discriminatory abilities for long-term clinical outcomes.""","""['Denis Maillet', 'Nathalie Allioli', 'Julien Peron', 'Adriana Plesa', 'Myriam Decaussin-Petrucci', 'Sophie Tartas', 'Alain Ruffion', 'Sébatien Crouzet', 'Ruth Rimokh', 'Pierre-Germain Gillet', 'Gilles Freyer', 'Virginie Vlaeminck-Guillem']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Eur Urol Oncol""","""['AR-V7 in Peripheral Whole Blood of Patients with Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer: Association with Treatment-specific Outcome Under Abiraterone and Enzalutamide.', 'Androgen Receptor Splice Variant 7 and Efficacy of Taxane Chemotherapy in Patients With Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Androgen Receptor Modulation Optimized for Response-Splice Variant: A Phase 3, Randomized Trial of Galeterone Versus Enzalutamide in Androgen Receptor Splice Variant-7-expressing Metastatic Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'AR-V7 Androgen Receptor Variant as a Predictor of Response to Androgen-receptor Targeting Agents Used to Treat Castration-refractory Metastatic Prostate Cancer.', 'Development of AR-V7 as a putative treatment selection marker for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Predicting response to enzalutamide and abiraterone in metastatic prostate cancer using whole-omics machine learning.', 'Diagnostic value of liquid biopsy in the era of precision medicine: 10 years of clinical evidence in cancer.', 'The Crucial Role of AR-V7 in Enzalutamide-Resistance of Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Comparison of circulating tumor cells and AR-V7 as clinical biomarker in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer patients.', 'Prognostic and Predictive Value of Liquid Biopsy-Derived Androgen Receptor Variant 7 (AR-V7) in Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.']"""

Although surgery and radiotherapy (RT) with or without androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) are widely adopted treatment options for localized PCA together with active surveillance (AS), there is no consensus nor randomised trials on treatment selection, prospective quality of life (QOL), along with toxicity outcomes and according to treatment modality in the Italian population. The current study aimed to describe clinical-therapeutic features and QOL at PCA diagnosis, according to different treatment patterns in a large prospective, Italian population, enrolled in the Pros-IT CNR study.  Methods:   The Pros-IT CNR is an on-going national, multicenter, observational, prospective study on patients affected by PCA who have been referred by 97 Italian Urology, Radiation Oncology and Medical Oncology facilities participating in the project. The possible relationships between the treatment patterns reported in the 6 month follow-up case report form and patients' features at diagnosis were evaluated using exploratory multiple correspondence analysis (MCA) and other data analysis method.  Results:   At diagnosis, surgery and AS patients were significantly younger, had fewer comorbidities, lower PSA levels and Gleason Score (GS) values; they were also diagnosed at an earlier stage of disease with respect to the RT or ADT patients who showed significantly worse QoL scores at the time of diagnosis.  Conclusions:   An analysis of the data collected at baseline and 6 months later uncovered substantial differences in ages, comorbidities, clinical and QOL features in the various treatment groups. These findings do not fully reflect the current PCA treatment guidelines and suggest the need for a multidisciplinary consensus guideline to ameliorate both the counselling and treatments of PCA patients.""","""['Michela Buglione', 'Marianna Noale', 'Alessio Bruni', 'Alessandro Antonelli', 'Filippo Bertoni', ""Renzo Corvo'"", 'Umberto Ricardi', 'Paolo Borghetti', 'Marta Maddalo', 'Claudio Simeone', 'Ercole Mazzeo', 'Angelo Porreca', 'Sergio Serni', 'Pierfrancesco Bassi', 'Mauro Gacci', 'Vincenzo Mirone', 'Rodolfo Montironi', 'Andrea Tubaro', 'Alfredo Berruti', 'Giario Natale Conti', 'Stefania Maggi', 'Stefano Maria Magrini', 'Luca Triggiani;Pros-IT CNR study group']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Disease-specific and general health-related quality of life in newly diagnosed prostate cancer patients: the Pros-IT CNR study.', 'Health-related quality of life 24 months after prostate cancer diagnosis: an update from the Pros-IT CNR prospective observational study.', 'How radical prostatectomy procedures have changed over the last 10\xa0years in Italy: a comparative analysis based on more than 1500 patients participating in the MIRROR-SIU/LUNA and the Pros-IT CNR study.', 'Quality of Life Outcomes after Primary Treatment for Clinically Localised Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Review.', 'Prostate-Specific Antigen-Based Screening for Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Evidence Review for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force Internet.', 'Early results of PRO-EPI: PROspective multicenter observational study on elective pelvic nodes irradiation in patients with intermediate/high/very high-risk non-metastatic prostate cancer submitted to radical, adjuvant, or salvage radiotherapy with or without concomitant androgen deprivation therapy.', 'How Has Prostate Cancer Radiotherapy Changed in Italy between 2004 and 2011?

Proteomic strategies, aiming to reflect the functional activity of cells, are nowadays among the leading approaches to tackle the challenges not only of better diagnosis, but also of unraveling mechanistic details related to disease etiology and progression.  Methods:   We conducted here a large SILAC-based Mass Spectrometry experiment to map the proteomes and phosphoproteomes of four widely used prostate cell lines, namely PNT1A, LNCaP, DU145 and PC3, representative of different cancerous and hormonal status.  Results:   We identified more than 3000 proteins and phosphosites, from which we quantified more than 1000 proteins and 500 phosphosites after stringent filtering. Extensive exploration of this proteomics and phosphoproteomics dataset allowed characterizing housekeeping as well as cell-line specific proteins, phosphosites and functional features of each cell line. In addition, by comparing the sensitive and resistant cell lines, we identified protein and phosphosites differentially expressed in the resistance context. Further data integration in a molecular network highlighted the differentially expressed pathways, in particular migration and invasion, RNA splicing, DNA damage repair response and transcription regulation.

D-dimer levels were measured in radiation oncology patients, who were diagnosed with prostate, breast or lung cancer, or leukemia, as well as in healthy subjects serving as controls. Blood samples from radiotherapy patients were taken at three different time points: pre-, on- and post-radiotherapy. For the patients, considered together, differences between the D-dimer levels at these three time points compared to controls were statistically significant. Compared to the pre-radiotherapy measurements, radiation exposure was associated with a significant increase in the D-dimer levels at the on- and post-radiotherapy time points. At the post-radiotherapy time point, D-dimer levels in the patients were not significantly reduced compared to the on-radiotherapy levels, indicating that the risk for developing disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) may be increased in some radiation oncology patients. Of particular concern are the post-radiotherapy results observed for the D-dimer levels in the leukemia patients, in which the average fold increase in the D-dimer levels was 5.43 (compared to the pre-radiotherapy levels). These results suggest that leukemia patients might benefit from frequent assessment of their D-dimer levels after their total-body irradiation-conditioning regimen to detect early signs of DIC development. It is hoped that the results described here will lead to heightened awareness in the radiation oncology community that the risk of DIC development is greatly increased in some of these patients.""","""['Natalia Louneva', 'Amit Maity', 'Ann R Kennedy']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Radiat Res""","""['Elevated levels of soluble fibrin or D-dimer indicate high risk of thrombosis.', 'D-dimer and prothrombin fragment 1 + 2 predict venous thromboembolism in patients with cancer: results from the Vienna Cancer and Thrombosis Study.', 'Plasma D-dimer levels and their relationship to serum fibrinogen/fibrin degradation products in hypercoagulable states.', 'A novel molecular marker for thrombus formation and life prognosis--clinical usefulness of measurement of soluble fibrin monomer-fibrinogen complex (SF).', 'Prognostic importance of cross-linked fibrin degradation products (D-dimer) in oncology.', 'Prognostic value of plasma D-dimer levels in advanced non-small cell lung cancer patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors: a retrospective study.', 'A Coagulation-Related Gene-Based Prognostic Model for Invasive Ductal Carcinoma.', 'The D-dimer level predicts the prognosis in patients with lung cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Application of an elevated plasma D-dimer cut-off value improves prognosis prediction of advanced non-small cell lung cancer.']"""

The proportion of cores with the highest Gleason grade group among positive cores was calculated and patients were divided into three groups based on the proportion (≤33% vs >33% and ≤67% vs >67%).Results: Tumor characteristics, including PSA level, biopsy Gleason grade, preoperative MR imaging, pathologic grade, pathologic stage and tumor volume, were worse in patients with a highest Gleason grade proportion, ≤33%.

Recently, enzalutamide (Enz), an oral androgen receptor inhibitor, was approved for treating patients with mCRPC. Invariably, all PCa patients eventually develop resistance against Enz. Therefore, novel strategies aimed at overcoming Enz resistance are needed to improve the survival of PCa patients. The role of exosomes in drug resistance has not been fully elucidated in PCa. Therefore, we set out to better understand the exosome's role in the mechanism underlying Enz-resistant PCa. Results showed that Enz-resistant PCa cells (C4-2B, CWR-R1, and LNCaP) secreted significantly higher amounts of exosomes (2-4 folds) compared to Enz-sensitive counterparts. Inhibition of exosome biogenesis in resistant cells by GW4869 and dimethyl amiloride strongly decreased their cell viability. Mechanistic studies revealed upregulation of syntaxin 6 as well as its increased colocalization with CD63 in Enz-resistant PCa cells compared to Enz-sensitive cells. Syntaxin 6 knockdown by specific small interfering RNAs in Enz-resistant PCa cells (C4-2B and CWR-R1) resulted in reduced cell number and increased cell death in the presence of Enz. Furthermore, syntaxin 6 knockdown significantly reduced the exosome secretion in both Enz-resistant C4-2B and CWR-R1 cells. The Cancer Genome Atlas analysis showed increased syntaxin 6 expressions associated with higher Gleason score and decreased progression-free survival in PCa patients. Importantly, IHC analysis showed higher syntaxin 6 expression in cancer tissues from Enz-treated patients compared to Enz naïve patients. Overall, syntaxin 6 plays an important role in the secretion of exosomes and increased survival of Enz-resistant PCa cells.""","""['Taylor C Peak', 'Gati K Panigrahi', 'Prakash P Praharaj', 'Yixin Su', 'Lihong Shi', 'Jacqueline Chyr', 'José Rivera-Chávez', 'Laura Flores-Bocanegra', 'Ravi Singh', 'Donald J Vander Griend', 'Nicholas H Oberlies', 'Bethany A Kerr', 'Ashok Hemal', 'Rhonda L Bitting', 'Gagan Deep']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Mol Carcinog""","""['Preclinical Study using Malat1 Small Interfering RNA or Androgen Receptor Splicing Variant 7 Degradation Enhancer ASC-J9® to Suppress Enzalutamide-resistant Prostate Cancer Progression.', 'Targeting AR-Beclin 1 complex-modulated growth factor signaling increases the antiandrogen Enzalutamide sensitivity to better suppress the castration-resistant prostate cancer growth.', 'Targeting prostate cancer cells with enzalutamide-HDAC inhibitor hybrid drug 2-75.', 'The evolving role of enzalutamide on the treatment of prostate cancer.', 'Indirect comparison between abiraterone acetate and enzalutamide for the treatment of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer: a systematic review.', 'The biogenesis and secretion of exosomes and multivesicular bodies (MVBs): Intercellular shuttles and implications in human diseases.', 'siRNA screening reveals that SNAP29 contributes to exosome release.', 'Extracellular vesicles: A dive into their role in the tumor microenvironment and cancer progression.', 'Effect of Ethanol on Exosome Biogenesis: Possible Mechanisms and Therapeutic Implications.', 'The Machinery of Exosomes: Biogenesis, Release, and Uptake.']"""

Whereas, the activity of PCAT-1 silence in ovarian cancer (OC) remains elusive. Here, our study was designed to corroborate the function of PCAT-1 silence in cellular activities and the molecular mechanisms. PCAT-1 in human ovarian tumor tissue specimens and cell lines (A2780 and SKOV3) were quantified by real-time quantitative reverse polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Reinforced silence of PCAT-1 and microRNA (miR)-124-3p was established by transfection and identified by qRT-PCR. The viability, apoptosis as well as migration and invasion were examined. Western blot was exploited for analysis of proteins involved in proliferation, apoptosis, migration and invasion, and signaling transduction. OC tissues showed the accumulation of PCAT-1. Silencing PCAT-1 caused the impediment of proliferation, migration, and invasion with the increase in apoptosis. PCAT-1 knockdown repressed the expression of cyclin D1, CDK6, p53, Bax, cleaved caspase-3, metallopeptidases, and vimentin with the restoration of miR-124-3p. However, the roles of PCAT-1 silence were weakened in the absence of miR-124-3p. PCAT-1 silence caused decrease in Wnt3a, β-catenin, and phosphorylation of protein kinase B and mechanistic target of rapamycin was abolished by miR-124-3p inhibitor.

In this study, we report for the first time, a novel targeted self-assembled based on PEG-PLA nanoparticles (PEG-PLA NPs) containing galbanic acid (GBA) and docetaxel, which was targeted using ((S)-2-(3-((S)-5-amino-1-carboxypentyl) ureido) pentanedioic acid (ACUPA), a small molecule inhibitor targeting prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA), in prostate cancer cell line. The prepared NPs were characterized by different analytical methods. The MTT assay was used to compare the anti-proliferation of drugs-loaded PEG-PLA NPs and ACUPA-PEG-PLA against LNCaP (PSMA+ ) and PC3 (PSMA- ) cells. PEG-PLA NPs with an average size of 130-140 nm had an enhanced release of GBA and docetaxel at pH 5.5 compared with pH 7.5. Spectrofluorometric analysis suggested that ACUPA-modified PEG-PLA could effectively enhance the drug uptake in PSMA+ prostate cancer cells. Cytotoxicity studies showed that the targeted NPs loaded with different concentrations of GBA and fixed concentration of docetaxel (4 nM) have shown higher toxicity (IC50 30 ± 3 µM) than both free GBA (80 ± 4.5 µM) and nontargeted NPs (IC50 40 ± 4.6 µM) in LNCaP cells.

Methods:   All patients diagnosed with HCC between 2004 and 2014 were identified from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database. Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox regression analysis were conducted to determine survival differences and impact of prior cancer history.  Results:   In total, 32,343 eligible patients with HCC were included in the current study, and 2830 (8.7%) of those patients had prior cancer. Patients who had prior cancer were older and more frequently at localized or regional stages of HCC compared to those without a history of cancer. No differences in overall or cancer-specific survival rates were observed among patients with or without prior cancer, as revealed by the Kaplan-Meier curves. In multivariable Cox regression analysis, a history of cancer was not a prognostic factor for worse overall (HR = 0.99, 95%CI 0.94-1.03, P = 0.577) or HCC-specific (HR = 1.01, 95%CI 0.96-1.06, P = 0.802) survival after adjustment for various covariates.

The aim of the present study was to determine factors associated with the development of biochemical recurrence following robot-assisted radical prostatectomy among those prostate cancer patients.  Methods:   We retrospectively reviewed the data of patients who underwent robot-assisted radical prostatectomy without neoadjuvant endocrine therapy. We evaluated prognostic factors in 1096 prostate cancer patients with pT2 disease and negative surgical margins. Univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression analyses were used to identify independent predictors for biochemical recurrence.  Results:   Of the 1096 patients, 55 experienced biochemical recurrence during the follow-up period. The 5-year biochemical recurrence-free survival rate for patients with pT2 and negative surgical margins was 91.8%. On univariate analysis, clinical stage, biopsy Gleason score, percent of positive core, pathological Gleason score, and the presence of micro-lymphatic invasion were significantly associated with biochemical recurrence. On a multivariate analysis, the presence of micro-lymphatic invasion and a pathological Gleason score ≥ 4 + 3 were significant prognostic factors for biochemical recurrence. Based on these factors, we developed a risk stratification model. The biochemical recurrence-free survival rate differed significantly among the risk groups.  Conclusions:   The prognosis of prostate cancer patients with pT2 disease and negative surgical margins is favorable.

We examined whether zoledronic acid (ZA) decreased the risk of skeletal-related events (SREs) among patients with bone metastases (BMs) from breast cancer (BC) or prostate cancer (PC), or multiple myeloma (MM) in routine clinical practice.  Materials and methods:   We conducted a propensity score-matched cohort study using the Korean National Health Insurance database. Our cohort included patients diagnosed with BM after BC or PC, or MM between 2004 and 2015. SRE was defined as having a record of pathologic fracture, spinal cord compression, radiation, or surgery to bone. The incidence of multiple SREs was calculated according to SRE history. We calculated the incidence rate ratio (IRR) to examine the relative difference in the risk of SREs of ZA users compared to those of ZA non-user.  Results:   Among 111,679 patients, diagnosed with BM and one of the three cancer types, 5608 were included in the analysis after propensity score matching. A decreased risk of SREs was observed for the ZA use in patients with history of SRE in BC [IRR = 0.74, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.66-0.83], PC (IRR = 0.86, 95% CI = 0.73-1.02), and MM (IRR = 0.74, 95% CI = 0.59-0.93). For patients without SRE history, ZA use was not associated with decreased risks of SREs, but rather increased the risks (BC: IRR = 1.96, 95% CI 1.87-2.05; PC: IRR = 1.66, 95% CI 1.54-1.80; MM: IRR = 1.92, 95% CI 1.57-2.34).

The aim of this study was to compare the ""common"" protocol of 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT with a modified protocol.  Methods:   In 2017, we used the following scanning protocol for 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT in patients with recurrent PC: acquisition at 1 h p.i. without further preparations. From 2018, all scans were conducted at 1.5 h p.i. In addition, patients were orally hydrated with 1 L of water 0.5 h p.i. and were injected with 20 mg of furosemide 1 h p.i. Both protocols including 112 patients (2017) and 156 (modified protocol in 2018) were retrospectively compared. Rates of pathologic scans, maximum standardized uptake values (SUVmax), and tumor contrast (ratio lesion-SUVmax/background-SUVmean) as well as average standardized uptake values (SUVmean) of urinary bladder were analyzed.  Results:   Both tumor contrast and tracer uptake were significantly (p < 0.001) higher in the novel protocol. Although statistically not significant, the rates of pathologic scans were also higher in the modified protocol: 76.3% vs. 68.8% for all PSA values including 38.9% vs. 25.0% for PSA < 0.5 ng/ml and 60.0% vs. 56.7% for PSA > 0.5-≤ 2.0 ng/ml. Average SUVmean of the urinary bladder was significantly (p < 0.001) lower with the modified protocol.

IL-8 expression and release in cancer cells was quantified using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Apoptosis was quantified using caspase activity and Annexin-V/PI staining.  Results:   We observed IL-8 release from cancer cells in response to histone deacetylase inhibitor, apicidin (Api), and non-competitive inhibitor of the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase, thapsigargin (TG). IL-8 release was increased upon TG-treatment. TG-induced IL-8 expression was reduced in the presence of Api in Bax-dependent manner. Increased apoptosis was associated with decreased IL-8 expression in response to combined treatment of TG and Api. TG and Api combination induced caspase-8 and caspase-9 dependent apoptosis. Hsp60 knockdown abrogated IL-8 expression induced by Api, TG, and their combination. The level of TGF-β, an upstream regulator of IL-8, was decreased upon Hsp60-silencing.

Previous studies identified differently expressed lncRNAs in docetaxel-resistant PCa cell lines, while the potential mechanisms were still unknown. In the present study, we found NEAT1 was expressed at high levels in docetaxel-resistant PCa clinical samples and related cell lines. When knockdown NEAT1, cell proliferation and invasion in docetaxel-resistant PCa cells in vitro and in vivo were downregulated. Our further researches explained that NEAT1 exerts oncogenic function in PCa by competitively 'sponging' both miR-34a-5p and miR-204-5p. Inhibition of miR-34a-5p or miR-204-5p expression mimics the docetaxel-resistant activity of NEAT1, whereas ectopic expression of miR-34a-5p or miR-204-5p attenuates the anti-drug function of NEAT1 in PCa cells. Besides, we also found ACSL4 is a target of both miR-34a-5p and miR-204-5p, and ACSL4 was also inhibited by miR-34a-5p and miR-204-5p. Moreover, suppression of miR-34a-5p or/and miR-204-5p greatly restrained the expression of ACSL4 upon NEAT1 overexpression. Joint expression of miR-34a-5p and miR-204a-5p synergistically decreased the expression of ASCL4, indicating miR-34a-5p and miR-204a-5p collaboratively inhibit the expression of ACSL4.

We have previously shown that time to nadir (TTN) of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) is an important prognostic factor in patients from a single center in Northwestern China. In this study, we performed a multicenter validation of the prognostic role of TTN in additional Chinese patients with mCRPC receiving docetaxel treatment.  Materials and methods:   The data were gathered from 170 eligible Chinese patients who received docetaxel chemotherapy from January 2007 to October 2018 in 11 Chinese Prostate Cancer Consortium member hospitals in China. TTN was defined as the time from start of chemotherapy to the nadir of PSA level during the treatment. Multivariable Cox regression models and Kaplan-Meier analysis were used to predict overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS).  Results:   Patients with a TTN ≥ 15 weeks had a longer OS and PFS compared to those with a TTN < 15 weeks (43 vs. 15 months, P < 0.001; 24 vs. 6 months, P < 0.001, respectively). In addition, Patients with a TTN ≥ 15 weeks and PSA nadir <4.55ng/ml were associated with longer OS than others (HR 0.093, 95% CI 0.044-0.188, P < 0.001; HR 4.002, 95% CI 1.890-8.856, P = 0.001, respectively) and TTN, PSA nadir, PSA baseline (optimal threshold 56.07 ng/ml), and PSA reduction (optimal threshold 50%) were associated with PFS (HR 0.238, 95% CI 0.149-0.382, P < 0.001; HR 1.676, 95% CI 1.033-2.722, P = 0.037; HR 1.770, 95% CI 1.134-2.763, P = 0.012; HR 0.573, 95% CI 0.428-0.756, P < 0.001; respectively).

Furthermore, pathologists provided histopathological diagnoses on 896 pathological images, and we compared the deep learning-focused regions with the genuine cancer locations through 3D reconstruction of pathological images. The area under the curve (AUC) for MR images classification was sufficiently high (AUC = 0.90, 95% confidence interval 0.87-0.94). Deep learning-focused regions overlapped radiologist-identified targets by 70.5% and pathologist-identified cancer locations by 72.1%.

Increasing evidence confirms its influence on prostate cancer cells. However, studies on the effects of leptin on the proliferation and apoptosis of the androgen-sensitive LNCaP line of prostate cancer cells brought conflicting results. Therefore, we performed studies on the effects of high LEP concentration (1 × 10-6 M) on gene expression profile, change of selected signaling pathways, proliferation and apoptosis of LNCaP cells. RTCA (real-time cell analyzer) revealed inhibitory effect of LEP on cell proliferation, but lower LEP concentrations (10-8 and 10-10 M) did not affect cell division. Moreover, flow cytometry with a specific antibody for Cleaved PARP-1, an apoptosis marker, confirmed the activation of apoptosis in leptin-exposed LNCaP line of prostate cancer cells. Within 24 h LEP (10-6 M) increases expression of 297 genes and decreases expression of 119 genes. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were subjected to functional annotation and clusterization using the DAVID bioinformatics tools. Most ontological groups are associated with proliferation and apoptosis (seven groups), immune response (six) and extracellular matrix (two). These results were confirmed by the Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA). The leptin's effect on apoptosis stimulation was also confirmed using Pathview library. These results were also confirmed by qPCR method. The results of Western Blot analysis (exposure to LEP 10 min, 1, 2, 4 and 24 h) suggest (after 24 h) decrease of p38 MAPK, p44-42 mitogen-activated protein kinase and Bcl-2 phosphorylated at threonine 56. Moreover, exposure of LNCaP cells to LEP significantly stimulates the secretion of matrix metallopeptidase 7 (MMP7).

The Warburg effect describes the ability of cancer cells to consume larger amounts of glucose compared to normal tissues. We identified derivatives of natural 1,4-naphthoquinones to be active in CRPC and further synthetically modified them via glucose conjugation to increase selectivity by Warburg effect targeting. Mechanisms of action were examined by quantitative proteomics followed by bioinformatical analysis and target validation. Four synthesized molecules revealed the highest selectivity towards human CRPC cells, which correlated with higher GLUT-1 activity and expression. The compounds were able to induce pro-apoptotic signs and to inhibit the pro-survival processes and mechanisms of drug resistance (i.e., AR-signaling and autophagy). Proteome analysis suggested a disruption of the mitochondria/oxidative phosphorylation, which was validated by further functional analysis: thus, mitochondria depolarization, elevated levels of cytotoxic ROS, an increase of Bax/Bcl-2 ratio as well as release of mitochondrial AIF and cytochrome C to cytoplasm were observed. In conclusion, glucose-conjugated 1,4-naphthoquinones show potent activity and selectivity in human CRPC exerted via mitochondrial targeting.

While heterozygous pathogenic variants in the ATM gene are implicated as a cause of familial breast and pancreatic cancers to our knowledge ATM whole gene deletions have not been previously reported. We describe a contiguous gene deletion of the ATM locus in a multi-generation family of Italian descent with a strong family history of pancreatic cancer. A deletion of one copy of the entire ATM gene was identified by routine panel testing and further characterized by chromosomal microarray analysis. An 11q22.3 microdeletion of approximately 960 kb was identified that is predicted to result in loss of 10 genes including ATM. The deletion was identified in two additional family members including a presymptomatic daughter and an affected sibling. A normal disomic complement of the 11q22.3 region was detected in a third family member with a history of prostate and pancreatic cancer. Additional family members were not available for testing. Given available evidence that ATM haploinsufficiency can increase cancer risk, we predict that the observed copy number loss has likely contributed to hereditary cancer in this family. However, absence of the familial microdeletion in at least one affected family member suggests that ATM deletions are unlikely the sole contributing factor influencing tumor development in affected individuals. This case highlights 11q22.3 microdeletions of the ATM gene region as a possible risk factor for hereditary cancer, including pancreatic cancer. The same case provides a further cautionary tale for over interpretation of cancer risk associated tumor suppressor microdeletions and suggests that the variant may not be sufficient for tumor development or may modify the cancer risks associated with other, yet unidentified hereditary cancer genes.""","""['Heleen H Arts', 'Lorrie Lynch', 'Daria Grafodatskaya', 'Barry Eng', 'Lesley Malloy', 'John Duck', 'Robyn White', 'Crystal Woodside', 'Kathleen Bell', 'Kevin M Zbuk', 'Elizabeth McCready']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Cancer Genet""","""['Germline Pathogenic Variants in the Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated (ATM) Gene are Associated with High and Moderate Risks for Multiple Cancers.', 'The spectrum of genetic variants in hereditary pancreatic cancer includes Fanconi anemia genes.', 'Prevalence and characteristics of likely-somatic variants in cancer susceptibility genes among individuals who had hereditary pan-cancer panel testing.', 'Ataxia telangiectasia gene mutations in leukaemia and lymphoma.', 'Familial pancreatic carcinoma in Jews.', 'The genetics of ductal adenocarcinoma of the pancreas in the year 2020: dramatic progress, but far to go.']"""

Methods:   Using a combined genealogy of 2.3 million Utah individuals and the Utah Cancer Registry (UCR), relative risks (RRs) for cancers of other sites were estimated in 143 Ewing sarcoma patients using a Cox proportional hazards model with matched controls; however, risks in relatives were estimated using internal cohort-specific cancer rates in first-, second-, and third-degree relatives.  Results:   Cancers of three sites (breast, brain, complex genotype/karyotype sarcoma) were observed in excess in Ewing sarcoma patients. No Ewing sarcoma patients were identified among first-, second-, or third-degree relatives of Ewing sarcoma patients. Significantly increased risk for brain, lung/bronchus, female genital, and prostate cancer was observed in first-degree relatives. Significantly increased risks were observed in second-degree relatives for breast cancer, nonmelanoma eye cancer, malignant peripheral nerve sheath cancer, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and translocation sarcomas. Significantly increased risks for stomach cancer, prostate cancer, and acute lymphocytic leukemia were observed in third-degree relatives.

Relationship With International Society of Urological Pathology Grade Groups""","""OBJECTIVE. The objective of our study was to evaluate the relationship between the tumor-capsule contact length, defined as tumor contact length (TCL), and extraprostatic extension (EPE) using the MRI-based TCL measurements and the real TCL measurements from pathology and to determine whether the International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) grade group of the tumors influenced this relationship. MATERIALS AND METHODS. In this retrospective study, we reviewed prostate multiparametric MRI (mpMRI) studies performed between 2012 and 2018 of 1576 patients and found that 134 patients also underwent radical prostatectomy (RP) after mpMRI. Finally, 86 patients with index lesions in contact with the prostate capsule in RP specimens were enrolled in the study. ROC analysis was used to evaluate the cutoff values of TCLs measured at pathology and TCLs measured on MRI in terms of EPE according to ISUP grade groups. RESULTS. There was no statistically significant cutoff value for pathology-based TCL measurements in individual ISUP grade groups and subgroups. Although not statistically significant, pathology-based TCL cutoff values decreased (from 21.0 to 11.0 mm) as ISUP grade group increased in terms of EPE positivity. When the relationship between MRI-based TCL measurements and EPE was considered, statistically significant cutoff values (range, 14.5-16.6 mm) could be determined in many groups and subgroups with low ISUP grades (sensitivity, 66.7-100%; specificity, 52.8-93.0%; p = 0.006-0.042). However, no statistically significant cutoff value was found for high ISUP grades. CONCLUSION. ISUP grade groups may have an effect on the TCL-EPE relationship. When the MRI-based TCL and EPE relationship is evaluated independent of ISUP grade group, a cutoff value around 15-16 mm may be usable to predict EPE.""","""['Baris Bakir', 'Aslıhan Onay', 'Metin Vural', 'Ayşe Armutlu', 'Sevda Özel Yıldız', 'Tarık Esen']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""AJR Am J Roentgenol""","""['Combined Clinical Parameters and Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging for the Prediction of Extraprostatic Disease-A Risk Model for Patient-tailored Risk Stratification When Planning Radical Prostatectomy.', 'Prediction of extraprostatic extension by MRI tumor contact length: difference between anterior and posterior prostate cancer.', 'Diagnostic Utility of a Likert Scale Versus Qualitative Descriptors and Length of Capsular Contact for Determining Extraprostatic Tumor Extension at Multiparametric Prostate MRI.', 'Extraprostatic extension in prostate cancer: primer for radiologists.', 'Multiparametric MRI in detection and staging of prostate cancer.', 'Radiologic-pathologic correlation of prostatic cancer extracapsular extension (ECE).', 'Imaging features of the PI-RADS for predicting extraprostatic extension of prostate cancer: systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Negative mpMRI Rules Out Extra-Prostatic Extension in Prostate Cancer before Robot-Assisted Radical Prostatectomy.', 'The Quantitative Assessment of Using Multiparametric MRI for Prediction of Extraprostatic Extension in Patients Undergoing Radical Prostatectomy: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.', 'The relationship between amount of extra-prostatic extension and length of capsular contact: performances from MR images and radical prostatectomy specimens.']"""

The purpose of this article is to evaluate the MR findings of prostatic remnant after prostatectomy and estimate the prevalence of prostatic remnant in patients that undergo MRI after prostatectomy. MATERIALS AND METHODS. Sixty-six patients who had undergone radical prostatectomy with pathologically proven benign prostatic remnant between 2007 and 2017 were retrospectively reviewed. Pathologically proven benign prostatic remnant was determined on the basis of initial pathologic report. Of the 66 initial patients, 30 patients with biopsy-proven benign prostatic remnant without coexisting recurrent prostate carcinoma and three patients who underwent repeat resection for completion prostatectomy were enrolled. MRI characteristics including location, size, signal intensity on T2-weighted images and DWI, and contrast enhancement pattern were analyzed. Nine additional patients were found to have a prostatic remnant by imaging without biopsy. The prevalence of prostatic remnant among those undergoing MRI for suspected recurrence during the same period was estimated. RESULTS. Prostatic remnant was detected in 23 of 33 patients on MRI. The remaining 10 patients did not have any visible abnormality. The 23 detected lesions were located in three regions: under the vesicourethral anastomosis in five patients, in the bladder neck in 12 patients, and posterior to the bladder in six patients. On T2-weighted imaging, 17 of 23 lesions showed heterogeneous hyperintensity. On DWI, 14 lesions showed hyperintensity. Dedicated MRI studies were performed for suspected prostate cancer recurrence in 2466 patients during the same period. Prevalence of exclusively benign prostate remnant detectable on MRI was approximately 1% of that population (23/2466-35/2466), and overall prevalence of any prostate remnant detectable on MRI was 3% (75/2466). CONCLUSION. Benign prostate remnant after prostatectomy occurs at three common sites and typically shows heterogeneous hyperintensity on T2-weighted imaging. The prevalence of detectable prostatic remnant in men who undergo MRI for suspected recurrence was approximately 1-3%.""","""['Kotaro Yoshida', 'Naoki Takahashi', 'R Jeffrey Karnes', 'Adam T Froemming']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""AJR Am J Roentgenol""","""['MR imaging evaluation with a transrectal surface coil of local recurrence of prostatic cancer in men who have undergone radical prostatectomy.', 'Detection of Local Recurrence of Prostate Cancer After Radical Prostatectomy Using Endorectal Coil MRI at 3 T: Addition of DWI and Dynamic Contrast Enhancement to T2-Weighted MRI.', 'Combined Whole Body and Multiparametric Prostate Magnetic Resonance Imaging as a 1-Step Approach to the Simultaneous Assessment of Local Recurrence and Metastatic Disease after Radical Prostatectomy.', 'Incidental bladder cancers found on multiparametric MRI of the prostate gland: a single center experience.', 'PI-RR: The Prostate Imaging for Recurrence Reporting System for MRI Assessment of Local Prostate Cancer Recurrence After Radiation Therapy or Radical Prostatectomy-A Review.', 'The Role of mpMRI in the Assessment of Prostate Cancer Recurrence Using the PI-RR System: Diagnostic Accuracy and Interobserver Agreement in Readers with Different Expertise.', 'Clinical Application of the New Prostate Imaging for Recurrence Reporting (PI-RR) Score Proposed to Evaluate the Local Recurrence of Prostate Cancer after Radical Prostatectomy.']"""

The standard of reference was MRGB-derived histopathology. Two readers independently assessed each TZ lesion, assigning a score of 1-5 for T2WI, a score of 1-5 for DWI, and the overall PI-RADS assessment category according to PI-RADS v2 and v2.1. The diagnostic performance of the two methods was compared in terms of inter-reader agreement, diagnostic sensitivity, diagnostic specificity, and area under the ROC curve (AUC).  Results:   Of the 58 patients, 26 were diagnosed with PC (GS = 3 + 3, n = 9; GS = 3 + 4, n = 9; GS = 3 + 5, n = 1; GS = 4 + 3, n = 4; GS = 4 + 4, n = 3) and 32 with benign lesions.

In view of this, the author took AFAP1-AS1 as the research object to design an experimental study, and conducted an in-depth exploration of the pathogenesis of prostate cancer.  Methods:   RT-qPCR was used to detect the expression of AFAP1-AS1 and miR-512-3p in prostate cancer tissues and cell lines. Perforation, flow cytometry and CCK-8 were used to detect the effects of cell proliferation, migration and invasion of mir-512-3p and a AFAP1-AS1. And the luciferase reporter gene was used to detect the downstream target gene of AFAP1-AS1, and the expression of CDK4, CDK6 and CCND1 protein was detected by Western blot.  Results:   AFAP1-AS1 is highly expressed in prostate cancer tissues and cell lines. The expression level of AFAP1-AS1 is correlated with histological grade and distant metastasis. The overall level of patients with high expression of AFAP1-AS1 is low, and their survival rate is relatively low. Silencing AFAP1-AS1 can significantly increase the proliferation and migration of prostate cancer cells. AFAP1-AS1 silencing induces cell cycle arrest at G0/G1 phase. The downstream target of AFAP1-AS1 was mir-512-3p. The role of AFAP1-AS1 in the progression of prostate cancer cells was mediated by mir-512-3p.  Conclusion:   AFAP1-AS1 regulates miR-512-3p, so as to realize the regulation effect on the proliferation, invasion and migration of prostate cancer cells, and thereby promote the occurrence and development of prostate cancer, so as to provide the corresponding program for the treatment of prostate cancer.

Toxicity analysis showed no difference in ≥2 acute or late GI or GU toxicities between these 2 cohorts. A total of 48 patients were scored as urinary incontinence before radiation therapy, of which 39 (81.3%) reported incontinence recovery or stable at 1-year follow-up, and only 9 (18.8%) patients reported worsening. There was no difference between the 2 cohorts in urinary incontinence either at baseline or at 1-year follow-up.  Conclusions:   Dose escalation (72 Gy) demonstrated no improvement in 4-year bPFS compared with the 66 Gy regimen. However, the dose escalation was not associated with greater acute or late GU or GI toxicities and did not increase urinary incontinence.""","""['Xin Qi', 'Hong-Zhen Li', 'Xian-Shu Gao', 'Shang-Bin Qin', 'Min Zhang', 'Xiao-Mei Li', 'Xiao-Ying Li', 'Ming-Wei Ma', 'Yun Bai', 'Xue-Ying Li', 'Dian Wang']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys""","""['In Regard to Qi et al.', 'In Regard to Qi et\xa0al.', 'In Reply to Zilli et\xa0al.', 'Postoperative Radiation Therapy for Prostate Cancer: Comparison of Conventional Versus Hypofractionated Radiation Regimens.', 'Hypofractionated Radiation Therapy to the Prostate Bed With Intensity-Modulated Radiation Therapy (IMRT): A Phase 2 Trial.', 'Image Guided Hypofractionated Postprostatectomy Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy for Prostate Cancer.', 'Can early implementation of salvage radiotherapy for prostate cancer improve the therapeutic ratio?

Methods:   Dried and powdered seeds were extracted using 95% ethanol. The total ethanolic extract was further dissolved in distilled water and separated into petroleum ether, chloroform, ethyl acetate and aqueous extracts. Based on the results of in vitro anticancer studies of all extracts, the most highly active extract was selected for evaluation of apoptosis induction and cell cycle analysis on HELA and PC-3 cells at its half maximal inhibitory concentration using flow cytometry; DNA fragmentation by agarose gel electrophoresis and the expression of protein were measured by Western blot.  Results:   The chloroform fraction from the ethanolic extract of M. peregrina (CFEE) was the most active antitumor fraction. The selectivity index, determined using the normal Vero cell line, indicated that CFEE had a high degree of selectivity against HELA and PC-3 cells. CFEE induced apoptosis, confirmed by cell cycle arrest at sub-G0 phase and DNA fragmentation. CFEE induced an increase in mRNA expression of caspase-3, a decrease in Bcl-2 mRNA expression, and decreased ATP levels. CFEE increased protein expression of caspase-3 and decreased protein expression of poly-ADP-ribose polymerase-1 (PARP-1). Flow cytometric analysis showed an appreciable increase in the number of cells in the early apoptotic stage in CFEE-treated HELA and PC-3 cells. CFEE treatment significantly increased lipid peroxidation (malondialdehyde level) in HELA and PC-3 cells.

Radiotherapy and radical prostatectomy are the primary treatments for localized prostate cancer. Studies comparing anatomic changes in men before and after radical prostatectomy based on perineal ultrasonography are scarce in the literature.  Methods:   Thirty-one patients from 2 centers were selected for examination and surgery. They were allocated into mild and/or moderate and severe incontinence groups who underwent the transobturator sling procedure between August 2014 and August 2018. Perineal ultrasonography was performed in the preoperative period for 21 of these patients and 3-6 months postoperatively after the transobturator sling procedure for 30 patients. Hypermobility of the proximal urethra and voluntary contraction of the pelvic floor were evaluated during the Valsalva maneuver, perineal contraction and at rest.  Results:   Clinical improvements of >50% were significantly more frequent in the mild and/or moderate vs severe incontinence group after male sling surgery (P = .035).

The most active compound was identified to be the sodium channel peptide AaHIV with an IC50 value of 15 μM. At this concentration, AaHIV had low effect on the adhesion of DU145 cells to fibronectin. When compared to other Na+ channel Aa toxins, AaHIV was found to be 2 times more active than AaHI and AaHII on DU145 cells proliferation and slightly less active than AaHII on their adhesion. The three peptides are inactive on DU145 cells migration. AaHIV was found to be 16 times more active than veratridine, asteroidal alkaloid from plants of the lily family widely used as a sodium channel activator.

Objective:   To evaluate tolerance and tumor control outcomes in low- and intermediate-risk prostate cancer patients treated with high-dose SBRT following our phase 1 trial.  Design, setting, and participants:   A total of 551 patients with low- or intermediate-risk prostate cancer were treated with SBRT.  Intervention:   Treatment with 37.5-40Gy SBRT in five fractions directed to the prostate and seminal vesicles.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Outcome measurements included acute toxicities (<3 mo after radiotherapy [RT]) and late toxicities (>3 mo after RT) and tumor control evaluation (prostate-specific antigen [PSA] levels at 3-6-mo intervals and post-treatment prostate biopsy at 2yr).  Results and limitations:   Acute grade 2 gastrointestinal (GI) toxicities occurred in 1.8% of patients, and late grade 2 and 3 GI toxicities were observed in 3.4% and 0.4% of patients, respectively. Acute grade 2 genitourinary (GU) toxicities occurred in 10% of patients, and grade 3 acute GU toxicities were observed in 0.7% of patients. Late grade 2 and 3 GU toxicities were observed in 21.1% and 2.5% of patients, respectively. The use of a hydrogel rectal spacer was significantly associated with reduced late GI toxicity and lower odds of developing late GU toxicity. The median follow-up was 17 mo, and 53% of those with at least 2yr of follow-up (103/193) had a biopsy performed. The 5-yr cumulative incidence of PSA failure was 2.1%, and the incidence of a positive 2-yr treatment biopsy was 12%. Limitations to this report include its retrospective nature and short follow-up time.  Conclusions:   Favorable short-term outcomes were achieved with high-dose SBRT for low- and intermediate-risk disease. Severe late toxicities were observed and favorable tumor control was found.

We report early toxicity and efficacy outcomes with this approach.  Materials/methods:   Patients with newly diagnosed high-risk prostate cancer were staged using PSMA PET, computed tomography (CT) and bone scans. Patients with LN positive-only metastases were offered curative therapy using 3 months androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) followed by DE-IMRT (using volumetric arc therapy), and 3 years adjuvant ADT. All patients had fiducial marker insertion, with privately insured patients having spacer hydrogel insertion. PET and prostate magnetic resonance imaging were fused with the planning CT. We aimed to deliver 81 Gy in 45 fractions (Fx) to the prostate and PET-positive LNs, and 60 Gy in 45Fx to bilateral elective pelvic LNs.  Results:   In all, 46 patients were treated, with 83% Gleason 8-10, 67% T3/T4, median number of LNs 2 (range 1-6), and median PET-positive LN volume 1.14 cc (range 0.15-4.14). LNs were outside of standard contouring guidelines in 37% of patients. The mean PET-positive LN clinical target volume dose ranged from 73.3 to 85.9 Gy (median 83.6 Gy).

We explored this in sarcomas by screening for oxidative stress sensitizers, which identified the class I HDAC inhibitor MS-275 as enhancing vulnerability to reactive oxygen species (ROS) in sarcoma cells. Mechanistically, MS-275 inhibits YB-1 deacetylation, decreasing its binding to 5'-UTRs of NFE2L2 encoding the antioxidant factor NRF2, thereby reducing NFE2L2 translation and synthesis of NRF2 to increase cellular ROS. By global acetylomics, MS-275 promotes rapid acetylation of the YB-1 RNA-binding protein at lysine-81, blocking binding and translational activation of NFE2L2, as well as known YB-1 mRNA targets, HIF1A, and the stress granule nucleator, G3BP1.

We hypothesize that germline single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in oxidative stress pathway are associated with prostate cancer (PCa) risk. In this study, we aim to examine which of these SNPs is associated with PCa.  Methods:   Participants included in this analyses came from the ""Genetic Susceptibility, Environment and Prostate Cancer Risk Study"" conducted at the Veterans Affairs Portland Health Care System. After applying exclusion criteria, 231 PCa cases and 382 prostate biopsy-negative controls who had genotyping data on twenty-two single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in six genes (MAPK14, NRF2, CAT, GPX1, GSTP1, SOD2, and XDH) associated with oxidative stress pathway were included in the analyses. The genotyping of SNPs was conducted by the Illumina BeadXpress VeraCode platform. We investigated these SNPs in relation to overall and aggressive PCa risk using logistic regression models controlling for relevant covariates.  Results:   One SNP in the MAPK14 (rs851023) was significantly associated with incident PCa risk. Compared to men carrying two copies of allele A, the presence of one or two copies of the G allele was associated with decreased risk of PCa [OR (95% CI) 0.19 (0.06-0.51)]. There was no statistically significant association between other SNPs in the NRF2, CAT, GPX1, GSTP1, SOD2, and XDH genes and PCa risk.

It has been shown that microRNAs (miRNAs) play a vital role in a variety of biological processes in cancers. However, whether miR-130b is involved in prostate cancer angiogenesis remains ill-defined.  Methods:   We performed the miRNA microarray to analyze miRNA expression in human prostate cancer specimens. In vitro gain-of-function assays and loss-of-function assays were conducted to explore the potential functions of miR-130b in human prostate cancer cells. Correlation analysis and dual-luciferase reporter assay were performed to validate whether tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) was a direct target of miR-130b. The Matrigel plug and tumor vascular imaging assays were performed to confirm the anti-angiogenic activity of miR-130b in nude mice.  Results:   We found that miR-130b was one of the miRNAs being most significantly downregulated. Subsequently, we found that miR-130b expression was markedly downregulated in human prostate cancer cell lines. Down-regulation of miR-130b in prostate cancer cells significantly promoted the proliferation, invasion and tubule formation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), while ectopic expression of miR-130b blocked prostate cancer angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistic analyses indicated that tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) was regulated by miR-130b directly. MiR-130b attenuated nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) signaling and its downstream gene vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGFA) by directly inhibiting TNF-α expression. Additionally, subsequent investigations identified that the ectopic level of VEGFA markedly abrogated the anti-angiogenic effect induced by miR-130b. Interestingly, VEGFA could in turn decrease the expression of miR-130b, thus forming a negative feedback loop that drives the angiogenesis of prostate cancer.

Methods:   We conducted a case-control study among men who underwent at least two negative prostate biopsies followed by a sampling either positive (cases n = 111) or negative (controls n = 129) for prostate cancer between 1995 and 2014 at the University Hospital (Turin, Italy).

Conditional logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of the association between genes methylation and prostate cancer.  Results:   Age at biopsy and time interval between the two negative biopsies were not associated with methylation levels of the selected genes in neither cases nor controls. GSTP1 methylation in the first and in the second negative biopsy was associated with prostate cancer detection [OR per 1% increase: 1.14 (95% CI 1.01-1.29) for the second biopsy and 1.21 (95% CI 1.07-1.37) for the highest methylation level (first or second biopsy)]. A threshold > 10% for GSTP1 methylation corresponded to a specificity of 0.98 (positive likelihood ratio 7.87). No clear association was found for the other genes.

Methods:   The authors analyzed the data from cancer survivors (N = 566), identified using the Pennsylvania Cancer Registry, who responded to a Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System-derived questionnaire. They created age groups (e.g., 45-54 years, 55-64 years, 65-74 years, and 75 years and older) and calculated a composite score of eight common comorbidities (e.g., chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, heart disease) to assess multimorbidity. Logistic regression was used to estimate the association of demographic and behavioral/clinical risk factors (e.g., multimorbidity, perceived disability, body mass index) with PA.  Results:   Most respondents were females (62%), older (mean age = 68 years) and represented diverse cancer sites, including breast (n = 132), colorectal (n = 102), gynecologic (n = 106), prostate (n = 111), and lung (n = 80). PA participation was mixed; 44% of survivors reported achieving >150 min of aerobic PA, but half of lung and 37% of gynecologic survivors reported no PA (0 min/week). Higher multimorbidity (odds ratio = 0.82, confidence interval [0.69, 0.98], p < .05), obesity (odds ratio = 0.51, confidence interval [0.30, 0.86], p < .05), and perceived disability (odds ratio = 0.49, confidence interval [0.32, 0.77], p < .001) were negatively associated with PA participation. Strength training was suboptimal across all survivors.  Conclusion:   Most older survivors experienced comorbid conditions, and this was associated with less PA. Survivors who perceived themselves as disabled or who were obese were half as likely as others to participate in PA. This suggests an increasing need to address both physical and psychological limitations in designing PA interventions for real-world needs. Exercise interventions that address the unique needs of older survivors for multimorbidity, obesity, and perceived disability may strengthen opportunities for PA.""","""['Shirley M Bluethmann', 'Wayne Foo', 'Renate M Winkels', 'Scherezade K Mama', 'Kathryn H Schmitz']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""J Aging Phys Act""","""['Rethinking physical activity assessment in cancer survivors: a multi-component approach using NHANES data.', 'Rural-urban differences in meeting physical activity recommendations and health status in cancer survivors in central Pennsylvania.', 'Associations between physical activity and comorbidities in Korean cancer survivors.', 'Physical activity programming and counseling preferences among cancer survivors: a systematic review.', 'Social support and physical activity for cancer survivors: a qualitative review and meta-study.', 'Barriers to and facilitators of physical activity in adults living with and beyond cancer, with special emphasis on head and neck cancer: a systematic review of qualitative and mixed methods studies.', 'Light-intensity and moderate-to-vigorous intensity physical activity among older adult breast cancer survivors with obesity: A narrative review.', 'A Randomised, Comparative, Effectiveness Trial Evaluating Low- versus High-Level Supervision of an Exercise Intervention for Women with Breast Cancer: The SAFE Trial.', 'Rethinking physical activity assessment in cancer survivors: a multi-component approach using NHANES data.', 'Factors influencing physical activity participation among people living with or beyond cancer: a systematic scoping review.']"""

Loss of function and aberrant expression of DUSPs has been implicated in cancer progression and poor survival, yet the function of DUSP22 in prostate cancer (PCa) cells is not clear. Gene Expression Omnibus and cBioPortal microarray database analyses showed that DUSP22 expression was lower in PCa tissues than normal prostate tissues, and altered DUSP22 expression was associated with shorter progression-free and disease-free survival of patients with PCa. Exogenous DUSP22 expression in LNCaP, PC3, and C4-2B PCa cells inhibited cellular proliferation and colony formation, supporting a growth inhibitory role for DUSP22 in PCa cells. DUSP22 expression significantly attenuated epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor (EGFR) and its downstream ERK1/2 signaling by dephosphorylation. However, DUSP22 failed to suppress the growth of CWR22Rv1 and DU145 cells with elevated phosphorylated (p-)ERK1/2 levels. A serine-to-alanine mutation at position 58, a potential ERK1/2-targeted phosphorylation site in DUSP22, was sufficient to suppress growth of CWR22Rv1 cells with elevated p-ERK1/2 levels, suggesting a mutually antagonistic relationship between DUSP22 and ERK1/2 dependent on phosphorylation status. We showed that DUSP22 can suppress prostate-specific antigen gene expression through phosphatase-dependent pathways, suggesting that DUSP22 is an important regulator of the androgen receptor (AR) in PCa cells. Mechanistically, DUSP22 can interact with AR as a regulatory partner and interfere with EGF-induced AR phosphorylation at Tyr534, suggesting that DUSP22 serves as a crucial suppressor of both EGFR and AR-dependent signaling in PCa cells via dephosphorylation. Our findings indicate that loss of function of DUSP22 in PCa cells leads to aberrant activation of both EGFR-ERKs and AR signaling and ultimately progression of PCa, supporting the potential for novel therapeutic design of harnessing DUSP22 in the treatment of PCa.-Lin, H.-P., Ho, H.-M., Chang, C.-W., Yeh, S.-D., Su, Y.-W., Tan, T.-H., Lin, W.-J.

Whether antidiabetic medications are protective or potentially mask prostate cancer by lowering prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels is unclear.  Objective:   To examine the associations of antidiabetic medication use with (1) PSA levels, (2) frequency of PSA testing, (3) receipt of biopsy following elevated PSA results, and (4) prostate cancer detection at biopsy.  Design, setting, and participants:   Population-based cohort study using data from the Stockholm PSA and Biopsy Register. Participants were all prostate cancer-free men aged 40 to 79 years residing in Stockholm County, Sweden, between January 1, 2006, and December 31, 2015. Data were analyzed from November 2018 to March 2019.  Exposures:   One or more prescription for metformin, sulfonylurea, or insulin, as recorded in Sweden's National Prescribed Drug Register.  Main outcomes and measures:   Levels of PSA following first exposure to antidiabetic medications were assessed using multivariable linear regression. Frequency of PSA testing was assessed via multivariable Poisson regression. Biopsy following elevated PSA (≥3.0 ng/mL) and prostate cancer detection at biopsy were assessed via multivariable logistic regression.  Results:   The cohort of 564 666 men (median [range] age, 65 [40-79] years) consisted of 4583 men initially exposed to metformin, 1104 exposed to sulfonylurea, and 978 exposed to insulin who were age matched with unexposed men (1:5). Exposed men had lower median (interquartile range) PSA levels before starting antidiabetic medications compared with unexposed men (1.2 [0.7-2.5] vs 1.6 [0.8-3.2] ng/mL). After accounting for baseline differences, PSA levels did not vary from those of unexposed men following exposure to antidiabetic medications. Frequency of PSA testing was higher for those receiving metformin (rate ratio, 1.07; 95% CI, 1.06-1.09) and sulfonylurea (rate ratio, 1.06; 95% CI, 1.03-1.08) but was lower for those receiving insulin (rate ratio, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.77- 0.81). Likelihood of biopsy after elevated PSA was lower among men receiving metformin (odds ratio, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.80-0.96) and insulin (odds ratio, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.74-0.93). There were no differences in prostate cancer detection at biopsy, regardless of PSA levels that triggered the biopsy.  Conclusions and relevance:   This study's findings do not support the hypothesis that the inverse association between diabetes and prostate cancer is mediated through antidiabetic medications lowering PSA levels to mask prostate cancer. They do suggest potential detection bias due to fewer biopsies among men receiving antidiabetic medications, which may explain the lower prostate cancer risk in men with diabetes.""","""['Kerri Beckmann', 'Danielle Crawley', 'Tobias Nordström', 'Markus Aly', 'Henrik Olsson', 'Anna Lantz', 'Noor Binti Abd Jalal', 'Hans Garmo', 'Jan Adolfsson', 'Martin Eklund', 'Mieke Van Hemelrijck']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""JAMA Netw Open""","""['Diabetes Medications, Prostate-Specific Antigen Values, and the Chemoprevention of Prostate Cancer.', 'The risk of prostate cancer for men on aspirin, statin or antidiabetic medications.', 'Antidiabetic drug use and prostate cancer risk in the Finnish Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer.', 'Metformin use and risk of prostate cancer: results from the REDUCE study.', 'The influence of antidiabetic medications on the development and progression of prostate cancer.', 'Association of Diabetes Mellitus and Cholangiocarcinoma: Update of Evidence and the Effects of Antidiabetic Medication.', 'Prediagnostic markers of insulin resistance and prostate cancer risk and death: A pooled study.', 'Association between Alcohol Intake and Prostate Cancer Mortality and Survival.', 'Differential Biopsy Patterns Influence Associations between Multivitamin Use and Prostate Cancer Risk in the Selenium and Vitamin E Cancer Prevention Trial.', 'Association between diabetes, obesity, aging, and cancer: review of recent literature.', 'Diabetes and Prostate Cancer Outcomes in Obese and Nonobese Men After Radical Prostatectomy.']"""

First, we attempted to observe vorticity generation in the urinary bladder during spontaneous voiding using transabdominal color Doppler ultrasonography (CDUS). Second, we performed transrectal CDUS to evaluate the vorticity of urine flow in the prostatic urethra. Patients with prostate cancer were enrolled before robotic surgery and divided into the vorticity and non-vorticity groups based on CDUS findings for comparisons of longitudinal urethral diameter and prostatic urethral angle. Third, the vorticity of the voided urine stream was observed using a high-speed video-camera. Micturition was done in a standing position while synchronously monitored for urine flow using uroflowmetry.  Results:   Vorticity formation could be dynamically demonstrated in the urinary bladder and prostatic urethra using CDUS. The prostatic urethral angle of the vorticity group was more than that of the non-vorticity group. High-speed video recording could clearly capture vorticity and spiral shape generation in voided urine. The distance from the external urethral orifice to the first twist changed in accordance with urine flow rate.

Prostate volume (PV), prostate-specific antigen density (PSAD), free-serum PSA (FPSA)/PSAD, and free-to-total PSA (F/T)/PSAD had similar AUC (P>0.05), and had significantly higher AUC (P<0.001) than F/T, total-serum PSA (TPSA), and free-serum PSA (FPSA). Based on the optimal cutoff value, the sensitivity of (F/T)/PSAD and FPSA/PSAD was similar (P>0.05), and significantly higher than the PV and PSAD (P<0.05). The logistic regression model using a combination of age, FPSA, PV, PSAD, FPSA/PSAD, and (F/T)/PSAD showed higher AUC than each one alone (P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS (F/T)/PSAD can be used as a predictor for prostate cancer in the Chinese population aged >50 years and has a significantly lower false negative rate than PSAD and PV with a cutoff value of ≤0.731. A new parameter, FPSA/PSAD, has similar diagnostic accuracy comparable to (F/T)/PSAD. The diagnostic value of a combination of age, FPSA, PV, PSAD, FPSA/PSAD, and (F/T)/PSAD needs further investigation.""","""['Li-Bin Nan', 'Xiao-Tao Yin', 'Jiang-Ping Gao']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Med Sci Monit""","""['The influence of prostate volume on clinical parameters in prostate cancer screening.', 'The ratio of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) to prostate volume (PSA density) as a parameter to improve the detection of prostate carcinoma in PSA values in the range of < 4 ng/mL.', 'The influence of age on prostate cancer screening index.', 'The usefulness of percentage of free prostate specific antigen/prostate specific antigen density in the diagnosis of prostate cancer.', 'Performance of tPSA and f/tPSA for prostate cancer in Chinese.

The screening cutoff of 4.0 ng/mL may be inappropriately used during postsurgery surveillance, where 0.2 ng/mL is typically used, creating missed opportunities for effective salvage radiation treatment. We performed a study to determine whether guideline concordance with annual postoperative PSA surveillance increases when PSA values exceed 4 ng/mL, which represents a screening threshold that is not relevant after surgery.  Methods:   We used US Veterans Health Administration data to perform a retrospective longitudinal cohort study of men diagnosed with nonmetastatic prostate cancer from 2005 to 2008 who underwent radical prostatectomy. We used logistic regression to examine the association between postoperative PSA levels and receipt of an annual PSA test.  Results:   Among 10 400 men and 38 901 person-years of follow-up, annual guideline concordance decreased from 95% in year 1 to 79% in year 7. After adjustment, guideline concordance was lower for the youngest and oldest men, Black, and unmarried men. Guideline concordance significantly increased as PSA exceeded 4 ng/mL (adjusted odds ratio 2.20 PSA > 4-6 ng/mL vs PSA > 1-4 ng/mL, 95% confidence interval 1.20-4.03; P = .01).  Conclusions:   Guideline concordance with prostate cancer surveillance increased when PSA values exceeded 4 ng/mL, suggesting a screening threshold not relevant after prostate cancer surgery, where 0.2 ng/mL is considered treatment failure, is impacting cancer surveillance quality.

The importance of competing mortality for estimating lifetime risk""","""Objectives:   To calculate lifetime risks of cancer diagnosis and cancer-specific death, adjusted for competing mortality, and to compare these estimates with the corresponding risks published by the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW).  Design, setting:   Analysis of publicly available annual AIHW data on age-specific cancer incidence and mortality - for breast cancer, colorectal cancer, prostate cancer, melanoma of the skin, and lung cancer - and all-cause mortality in Australia, 1982-2013.  Outcome measures:   Lifetime risks of cancer diagnosis and mortality (to age 85), adjusted for competing mortality.  Results:   During 1982-2013, AIHW estimates were consistently higher than our competing mortality-adjusted estimates of lifetime risks of diagnosis and death for all five cancers. Differences between AIHW and adjusted estimates declined with time for breast cancer, prostate cancer, colorectal cancer, and lung cancer (for men only), but remained steady for lung cancer (women only) and melanoma of the skin. In 2013, the respective estimated lifetime risks of diagnosis (AIHW and adjusted) were 12.7% and 12.1% for breast cancer, 18.7% and 16.2% for prostate cancer, 9.0% and 7.0% (men) and 6.4% and 5.5% (women) for colorectal cancer, 7.5% and 6.0% (men) and 4.4% and 4.0% (women) for melanoma of the skin, and 7.6% and 5.8% (men) and 4.5% and 3.9% (women) for lung cancer.

This shows an association between VNTR and cancer, but this repeat sequence is likely to be associated with genomic instability. Therefore, we investigated the effects of hTERT-VNTR2-2nd on gastrointestinal cancer and the relationship between repeated sequence and chromosome instability.  Methods:   A case-control study was performed using DNA from 818 cancer-free controls, 539 cases with gastric cancer, 275 cases with colon cancer and 274 cases with rectal cancer. To determine whether minisatellites affect gene expression, expression levels were examined using TERT-reporter vectors in cell lines. In addition, the length of the hTERT-VNTR2-2nd alleles were determined in blood and cancer tissues from 107 gastric cancers, 112 colon cancers and 76 rectal cancers patients to determine whether the repeat sequence was associated with genomic instability during cancer development.  Results:   No statistically significant association between hTERT-VNTR2-2nd and risk of gastrointestinal cancer was detected. However, it has been shown that VNTRs inserted into the enhancer region can regulate the expression of TERT in gastrointestinal cancer cells. Moreover, hTERT-VNTR2-2nd was analyzed in matched blood and cancer tissue from patients with gastrointestinal cancer and in seven among 294 subjects, and hTERT-VNTR2-2nd was found to be rearranged.

A medical complication was observed in 359 (52.6%) patients, with UTI/pyelonephritis being the most common (19%), followed by renal failure (12%). The majority of patients (86%) received an incontinent urinary diversion. In multivariable analysis adjusted for age, gender and type of RT, patients treated with RT for bladder cancer had a 1.7 times increased relative risk of experiencing any complication after RC compared to those with RT for prostate cancer (p = 0.023).

It represents approximately 56% of all the newly diagnosed gliomas. Macrophages are one of the major constituents of tumor-infiltrating immune cells in the human gliomas. The role of immunosuppressive macrophages is very well documented in correlation with the poor prognosis of patients suffering from breast, prostate, bladder and cervical cancers. The current study highlights the correlation between the tumor-associated macrophage phenotypes and glioma progression. We observed an increase in the pool of M2 macrophages in high-grade gliomas, as confirmed by their CD68 and CD163 double-positive phenotype. In contrast, less M1 macrophages were noticed in high-grade gliomas, as evidenced by the down-regulation in the expression of CCL3 marker. In addition, we observed that higher gene expression ratio of CD163/CCL3 is associated with glioma progression. The Kaplan-Meier survival plots indicate that glioma patients with lower expression of M2c marker (CD163), and higher expression of M1 marker (CCL3) had better survival. Furthermore, we examined the systemic immune response in the peripheral blood and noted a predominance of M2 macrophages, myeloid-derived suppressor cells and PD-1+ CD4 T cells in glioma patients. Thus, the study indicates a high gene expression ratio of CD163/CCL3 in high-grade gliomas as compared to low-grade gliomas and significantly elevated frequency of M2 macrophages and PD-1+ CD4 T cells in the blood of tumor patients. These parameters could be used as an indicator of the early diagnosis and prognosis of the disease.""","""['Aurobind Vidyarthi', 'Tapan Agnihotri', 'Nargis Khan', 'Sanpreet Singh', 'Manoj K Tewari', 'Bishan D Radotra', 'Deepyan Chatterjee', 'Javed N Agrewala']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Cancer Immunol Immunother""","""['Tumor associated CD70 expression is involved in promoting tumor migration and macrophage infiltration in GBM.', 'Glioma grade is associated with the accumulation and activity of cells bearing M2 monocyte markers.', 'Distinct alterations of CD68+CD163+ M2-like macrophages and myeloid-derived suppressor cells in newly diagnosed primary immune thrombocytopenia with or without CR after high-dose dexamethasone treatment.', 'The neuropathological basis to the functional role of microglia/macrophages in gliomas.', 'Expression of macrophage antigens by tumor cells.', 'The Use of Targeted Cytokines as Cancer Therapeutics in Glioblastoma.', 'Pediatric Brain Tumours: Lessons from the Immune Microenvironment.', 'Exploring Monocytes-Macrophages in Immune Microenvironment of Glioblastoma for the Design of Novel Therapeutic Strategies.', 'Reprogramming tumor-associated macrophages as a unique approach to target tumor immunotherapy.', 'Comprehensive Investigation Illustrates the Role of M2 Macrophages and Its Related Genes in Pancreatic Cancer.']"""

The capabilities to display lesions of DWIb=800, b-value maps and optimal computed DWI (cDWI) images were evaluated by using a 4-point method of scoring. Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values of lesions were measured for the breast carcinoma. Mean scores indicating the display capability were compared among DWIb=800, optimal cDWI and b-value maps by using Kruskal-Wallis test followed by Nemenyi test. The scores of both b-value maps (3.92 ± 0.28) and optimal cDWI images (3.80 ± 0.41) were higher than that of DWIb=800 (3.48 ± 0.51), with statistical differences (P = .001 and P = .033, respectively). The optimal b values for manifesting breast carcinoma based on cDWI were 1000 to 1200 s/mm. The b-value map enables fast identification for breast lesions and shows similar performance to the optimal cDWI images.""","""['Na Zhao', 'Chao Ma', 'Xiaolong Ye', 'Nimpagaritse Danie', 'Caixia Fu', 'Qiang Hao', 'Jianping Lu']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Medicine (Baltimore)""","""['Feasibility and Diagnostic Performance of Voxelwise Computed Diffusion-Weighted Imaging in Breast Cancer.', 'Evaluation of Exponential ADC (eADC) and Computed DWI (cDWI) for the Detection of Prostate Cancer.', 'Quantitative evaluation of computed high B value diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging of the prostate.', 'Accelerated Breast Diffusion-weighted Imaging Using Multiband Sensitivity Encoding with the CAIPIRINHA Method: Clinical Experience at 3 T.', 'Quantitative evaluation of computed and voxelwise computed diffusion-weighted imaging in breast cancer.']"""

Cost-effectiveness analyses were conducted with individual-level data on health-care costs from comprehensive registers and register data on real-world effectiveness from the two arms of the Finnish Randomised Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer (FinRSPC), following 80,149 men from 1996 through 2015. The study examines cost-effectiveness in terms of overall mortality and, in addition, in terms of diagnosed men's mortality from prostate cancer and mortality with but not from prostate cancer. Neither arm of the FinRSPC was clearly more cost-effective in analysis in terms of overall mortality. Organised screening in the FinRSPC could be considered cost-effective in terms of deaths from prostate cancer: averting just over one death per 1000 men screened. However, even with an estimated incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of below 20,000€ per death avoided, this result should not be considered in isolation. This is because mass screening in this trial also resulted in increases in death with, but not from, prostate cancer: with over five additional deaths per 1000 men screened. Analysis of real-world data from the FinRSPC reveals new evidence of the comparative effectiveness of PSA-based screening after 20 years of follow-up, suggesting the possibility of higher mortality, as well as higher healthcare costs, for screening-arm men who have been diagnosed with prostate cancer but who do not die from it. These findings should be corroborated or contradicted by similar analyses using data from other trials, in order to reveal if more diagnosed men have also died in the screening arms of other trials of mass screening for prostate cancer.""","""['Neill Booth', 'Pekka Rissanen', 'Teuvo L J Tammela', 'Paula Kujala', 'Ulf-Håkan Stenman', 'Kimmo Taari', 'Kirsi Talala', 'Anssi Auvinen']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Costs of screening for prostate cancer: Evidence from the Finnish Randomised Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer after 20-year follow-up using register data.', 'Cost-effectiveness of prostate cancer screening: a simulation study based on ERSPC data.', 'The Cost-Effectiveness of Prostate Cancer Detection with the Use of Prostate Health Index.', 'Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA)-Based Population Screening for Prostate Cancer: An Economic Analysis.', 'Screening for prostate cancer with the prostate-specific antigen test: a review of current evidence.', 'Impact of PSA testing on secondary care costs in England and Wales: estimates from the Cluster randomised triAl of PSA testing for Prostate cancer (CAP).', 'Evaluating Prostate-Specific Antigen Screening for Young African American Men With Cancer.']"""

However, androgen receptor axis targeted therapies have also been shown to be effective. We aimed to analyze findings in randomized controlled trials investigating first-line treatment for hormone sensitive prostate cancer.  Materials and methods:   We systematically reviewed the literature according to the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) criteria and the PICO (Population, Intervention, Comparator, Outcomes) methodology. Outcomes of interest were overall and progression-free survival, and the rate of high grade adverse events.  Results:   No treatment was superior to docetaxel in terms of overall survival. However, abiraterone (HR 0.89, 95% CI 0.76-1.05), enzalutamide (HR 0.90, 95% CI 0.69-1.19) and apalutamide (HR 0.90, 95% CI 0.67-1.22) showed nonstatistically significant lower overall mortality rates than docetaxel.

DSTP3086S is a humanized immunoglobulin G1 anti-STEAP1 monoclonal antibody linked to the potent antimitotic agent monomethyl auristatin E. This study evaluated the safety and activity of DSTP3086S in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.  Methods:   Patients were enrolled in a 3 + 3 dose escalation study to evaluate DSTP3086S (0.3 to 2.8 mg/kg intravenously) given once every 3 weeks followed by cohort expansion at the recommended phase II dose or weekly (0.8 to 1.0 mg/kg).  Results:   Seventy-seven patients were given DSTP3086S once every 3 weeks, and seven were treated weekly. Two patients in the once-every-3-weeks dose escalation had dose-limiting grade 3 transaminitis. Grade 3 hyperglycemia and grade 4 hypophosphatemia were dose-limiting toxicities in one patient treated at 1.0 mg/kg weekly. Initial cohort expansion evaluated dosing at 2.8 mg/kg once every 3 weeks (n = 10), but frequent dose reductions led to testing of 2.4 mg/kg (n = 39) in the expansion phase. Common related adverse events (> 20%) across doses (once every 3 weeks) were fatigue, peripheral neuropathy, nausea, constipation, anorexia, diarrhea, and vomiting. DSTP3086S pharmacokinetics were linear. Among 62 patients who received > 2 mg/kg DSTP3086S once every 3 weeks, 11 (18%) demonstrated a ≥ 50% decline in prostate-specific antigen; two (6%) of 36 with measurable disease at baseline achieved a radiographic partial response; and of 27 patients with informative unfavorable baseline circulating tumor cells ≥ 5/7.5 mL of blood, 16 (59%) showed conversions to favorable circulating tumor cells < 5.

In previous studies, the differentially expressed genes were detected across patients in one cancer type. These studies ignored the role of mRNA expression changes in driving tumorigenic mechanisms that are either universal or specific in different tumor types. To address the problem, we introduce two network-based multi-task learning frameworks, NetML and NetSML, to discover common differentially expressed genes shared across different cancer types as well as differentially expressed genes specific to each cancer type. The proposed frameworks consider the common latent gene co-expression modules and gene-sample biclusters underlying the multiple cancer datasets to learn the knowledge crossing different tumor types.  Results:   Large-scale experiments on simulations and real cancer high-throughput datasets validate that the proposed network-based multi-task learning frameworks perform better sample classification compared with the models without the knowledge sharing across different cancer types. The common and cancer-specific molecular signatures detected by multi-task learning frameworks on The Cancer Genome Atlas ovarian, breast and prostate cancer datasets are correlated with the known marker genes and enriched in cancer-relevant Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genome pathways and gene ontology terms.

Materials/methods:   Patients with adenocarcinoma prostate with baseline Ga-prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) PETCT scan, and response scan after 3-12 months of ADT from 2014 to 2017 were analyzed. Change in radiotracer uptake in the prostate, involved regional nodes and distant metastasis was semiquantitatively assessed in paired scans using maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax). Response was categorized into complete or partial response (CR, PR) or stable disease or progressive disease (SD, PD), and correlated with known prognostic factors.  Results:   Total 86 scans of 43 patients (17 metastatic, M+) were analyzed. After median 6 months of ADT, 0% primary, 23.3% nodes and 17.6% metastases showed CR; 18.6% primary, 8.3% nodes and 35% metastases showed PD. Prostate response was not significantly associated with any prognostic factor. Nodal response was higher in M0 than in M+ disease (CR 37 vs 4%, P = 0.003). Oligometastases responded better than polymetastases (CR/PR 62.5 vs 11.1%, P = 0.05). Decline in SUVmax of primary tumor correlated with decline in serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) (90% of partial responders showed >80% decline in serum PSA vs 50% with PD, P = 0.06).

Doxorubicin (DOX) is one of the most widely used anti-neoplastic drugs for prostate cancer among others. However, it has low specificity and many side effects and affects normal cells. More recently, there have been newly developed drug delivery tools which are graphene or graphene-based, used to increase the specificity of the delivered drug molecules. The graphene derivatives possess both π-π stacking and increased hydrophobicity, factors that increase the likelihood of drug delivery. Despite this, the hydrophilicity of graphene remains problematic, as it induced problems with stability. For this reason, the use of a chitosan coating remains one way to modify the surface features of graphene.  Method:   In this investigation, a hybrid nanoparticle that consisted of a DOX-loaded reduced graphene oxide that is stabilized with chitosan (rGOD-HNP) was developed.  Result:   The newly developed rGOD-HNP demonstrated high biocompatibility and efficiency in entrapping DOX (~65%) and releasing it in a controlled manner (~50% release in 48 h).

This pilot clinical study investigated the feasibility and imaging performance of HP 13C-pyruvate MR metabolic imaging in prostate cancer patients with metastases to the bone and/or viscera.  Methods:   Six patients who had metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer were recruited. Carbon-13 MR examination were conducted on a clinical 3T MRI following injection of 250 mM hyperpolarized 13C-pyruvate, where pyruvate-to-lactate conversion rate (kPL) was calculated. Paired metastatic tumor biopsy was performed with histopathological and RNA-seq analyses.  Results:   We observed a high rate of glycolytic metabolism in prostate cancer metastases, with a mean kPL value of 0.020 ± 0.006 (s-1) and 0.026 ± 0.000 (s-1) in bone (N = 4) and liver (N = 2) metastases, respectively. Overall, high kPL showed concordance with biopsy-confirmed high-grade prostate cancer including neuroendocrine differentiation in one case. Interval decrease of kPL from 0.026 at baseline to 0.015 (s-1) was observed in a liver metastasis 2 months after the initiation of taxane plus platinum chemotherapy. RNA-seq found higher levels of the lactate dehydrogenase isoform A (Ldha,15.7 ± 0.7) expression relative to the dominant isoform of pyruvate dehydrogenase (Pdha1, 12.8 ± 0.9).  Conclusions:   HP 13C-pyruvate MRI can detect real-time glycolytic metabolism within prostate cancer metastases, and can measure changes in quantitative kPL values following treatment response at early time points.

Based on this observation, we examined temporal trends and predictors of IPC use in metastatic prostate cancer patients receiving critical care therapies (CCT).  Materials and methods:   We identified mPCa patients receiving CCT within the Nationwide Inpatient Sample database (2004-2015). IPC use rates were evaluated using univariable estimated annual percentage changes analyses. Multivariable logistic regression (MLR) models were used after adjustment for clustering at hospital level.  Results:   Of 4168 mPCa patients receiving CCT, 449 (11.3%) received IPC. IPC use increased from 1.2 to 22.3% (EAPC: +19.6%, p < 0.001). After stratification according to regions, race, and teaching status, the highest increase of IPC use was recorded in the South (from 0 to 25.4 %, EAPC: +27.6%), in Caucasians (from 1.5 to 24.4 %, EAPC: +19.8%; p < 0.001) and in teaching hospitals (from 0.9 to 26.2 %, EAPC: +19.6%; p < 0.001). In MLR models, teaching status (Odds ratio [OR]: 1.74, p < 0.001) and contemporary year interval (OR: 4.63, p < 0.001) were associated with higher IPC rates. Conversely, African American race (OR: 0.66, p < 0.001) and primary diagnosis of GU disorders (OR: 0.49, p < 0.001) and gastrointestinal (GI) disorders at admission (OR: 0.61, p = 0.02) were associated with lower IPC rates.  Conclusions:   IPC use rate in mPCa patients receiving CCT sharply increased between 2004 and 2015. The highest increase of IPC use across time was recorded in the South, in Caucasian race, and in teaching hospitals. African-American race and nonteaching status were identified as independent predictors of lower IPC use and represent targets for efforts aimed at improving IPC delivery in mPCa patients receiving CCT.""","""['Elio Mazzone', 'Francesco A Mistretta', 'Sophie Knipper', 'Zhe Tian', 'Carlotta Palumbo', 'Giorgio Gandaglia', 'Nicola Fossati', 'Shahrokh F Shariat', 'Fred Saad', 'Francesco Montorsi', 'Markus Graefen', 'Alberto Briganti', 'Pierre I Karakiewicz']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Prostate Cancer Prostatic Dis""","""['Prevalence, trend and disparities of palliative care utilization among hospitalized metastatic breast cancer patients who received critical care therapies.', 'Trends and Social Barriers for Inpatient Palliative Care in Patients With Metastatic Bladder Cancer Receiving Critical Care Therapies.', 'Use of Inpatient Palliative Care Services in Patients With Advanced Cancer Receiving Critical Care Therapies.', 'Readmissions in Cancer Patients After Receiving Inpatient Palliative Care in Taiwan: A 9-Year Nationwide Population-Based Cohort Study.', 'Trends in the prevalence of malignancy among patients admitted with acute heart failure and associated outcomes: a nationwide population-based study.', 'Resource use in the last year of life of prostate cancer patients-A register-based analysis.', 'Palliative care and healthcare utilization among metastatic breast cancer patients in U.S. Hospitals.', 'Disparities in Palliative and Hospice Care and Completion of Advance Care Planning and Directives Among Non-Hispanic Blacks: A Scoping Review of Recent Literature.', 'Prevalence, trend and disparities of palliative care utilization among hospitalized metastatic breast cancer patients who received critical care therapies.']"""

The in vivo role of DEPTOR in tumorigenesis remains elusive. Here we showed that the levels of both DEPTOR protein and mRNA were substantially decreased in human prostate cancer tissues, which positively correlated with disease progression. DEPTOR depletion accelerated proliferation and survival, migration, and invasion in human prostate cancer cells. Mechanistically, DEPTOR depletion not only activated both mTORC1 and mTORC2 signals to promote cell proliferation and survival, but also induced an AKT-dependent epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and β-catenin nuclear translocation to promote cell migration and invasion. Abrogation of mTOR or AKT activation rescued the biological consequences of DEPTOR depletion. Importantly, in a Deptor-KO mouse model, Deptor knockout accelerated prostate tumorigenesis triggered by Pten loss via the activation of mTOR signaling. Collectively, our study demonstrates that DEPTOR is a tumor suppressor in the prostate, and its depletion promotes tumorigenesis via the activation of mTORC1 and mTORC2 signals.

Many studies have indicated that castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) is associated with stem cell phenotypes, which could further promote neuroendocrine transdifferentiation. Although only a small subset of genetically pre-programmed cells in each organ has stem cell capability, CSCs appear to be inducible among a heterogeneous cancer cell population. However, the inductive mechanism(s) leading to the emergence of these CSCs are not fully understood in CRPC. Tumor cells actively produce, release, and utilize exosomes to promote cancer development and metastasis, cancer immune evasion as well as chemotherapeutic resistance; the impact of tumor-derived exosomes (TDE) and its cargo on prostate cancer (PCa) development is still unclear. In this study, we demonstrate that the presence of Cav-1 in TDE acts as a potent driver to induce CSC phenotypes and epithelial-mesenchymal transition in PCa undergoing neuroendocrine differentiation through NFκB signaling pathway.

Abiraterone has a propensity to hypermineralocorticism on top of androgen deprivation, so might carry an additional risk for atrial tachyarrhythmia (AT) and heart failure (HF) compared with other ADTs.  Aim:   To determine if abiraterone was associated with an increased proportion of AT and HF reports among all suspected adverse drug reactions (ADRs) reported in several pharmacovigilance databases compared with enzalutamide, other ADTs and all other drugs.  Methods:   In this observational retrospective pharmacovigilance study, we performed a disproportionality analysis of reports of suspected ADRs in men in the French pharmacovigilance database, the European pharmacovigilance database and the international pharmacovigilance database VigiBase, to evaluate the reporting odds ratios (RORs) of AT and HF for abiraterone compared with enzalutamide, other ADTs and all other drugs.  Results:   In the 5,759,781 ADR reports in men in VigiBase, 55,070 pertained to ADTs. The RORs for AT for abiraterone versus enzalutamide, other ADTs and all other drugs were 4.1 (95% confidence interval 3.1-5.3), 3.7 (3-4.5) and 3.2 (2.7-3.7), respectively (P<0.0001 for all). The corresponding RORs for HF were 2.5 (2-3), 1.5 (1.3-1.7) and 2 (1.7-2.3), respectively (P<0.0001 for all). These results were concordant with the French and European pharmacovigilance databases. Mean times to AT and HF onset were shorter with abiraterone (5.2±0.8 and 4.5±0.6 months, respectively) versus other ADTs (13.3±3.2 and 9.2±1.1 months, respectively) (both P<0.05). Cases on abiraterone versus other ADTs were more frequently associated with at least two ADR terms, including AT, HF, hypokalaemia, hypertension and oedema (13.6% vs 6%; P<0.0001). For abiraterone, age, but not dose, was associated with reporting of AT and HF versus any other ADR.

Objective:   To compare the cost-effectiveness of different stopping ages for lung cancer screening.  Design:   By using shared inputs for smoking behavior, costs, and quality of life, 4 independently developed microsimulation models evaluated the health and cost outcomes of annual lung cancer screening with low-dose computed tomography (LDCT).  Data sources:   The NLST; Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial; SEER (Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results) program; Nurses' Health Study and Health Professionals Follow-up Study; and U.S. Smoking History Generator.  Target population:   Current, former, and never-smokers aged 45 years from the 1960 U.S. birth cohort.  Time horizon:   45 years.  Perspective:   Health care sector.  Intervention:   Annual LDCT according to NLST, CMS, and USPSTF criteria.  Outcome measures:   Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) with a willingness-to-pay threshold of $100 000 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY).  Results of base-case analysis:   The 4 models showed that the NLST, CMS, and USPSTF screening strategies were cost-effective, with ICERs averaging $49 200, $68 600, and $96 700 per QALY, respectively. Increasing the age at which to stop screening resulted in a greater reduction in mortality but also led to higher costs and overdiagnosis rates.  Results of sensitivity analysis:   Probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed that the NLST and CMS strategies had higher probabilities of being cost-effective (98% and 77%, respectively) than the USPSTF strategy (52%).  Limitation:   Scenarios assumed 100% screening adherence, and models extrapolated beyond clinical trial data.  Conclusion:   All 3 sets of lung cancer screening criteria represent cost-effective programs.

Molecular mechanisms that contribute to radioresistance are not fully understood. Novel computational strategies are needed to identify radioresistance driver genes from hundreds of gene copy number alterations. We developed a network-based approach based on lasso regression in combination with network propagation for the analysis of prostate cancer cell lines with acquired radioresistance to identify clinically relevant marker genes associated with radioresistance in prostate cancer patients. We analyzed established radioresistant cell lines of the prostate cancer cell lines DU145 and LNCaP and compared their gene copy number and expression profiles to their radiosensitive parental cells. We found that radioresistant DU145 showed much more gene copy number alterations than LNCaP and their gene expression profiles were highly cell line specific. We learned a genome-wide prostate cancer-specific gene regulatory network and quantified impacts of differentially expressed genes with directly underlying copy number alterations on known radioresistance marker genes. This revealed several potential driver candidates involved in the regulation of cancer-relevant processes. Importantly, we found that ten driver candidates from DU145 (ADAMTS9, AKR1B10, CXXC5, FST, FOXL1, GRPR, ITGA2, SOX17, STARD4, VGF) and four from LNCaP (FHL5, LYPLAL1, PAK7, TDRD6) were able to distinguish irradiated prostate cancer patients into early and late relapse groups. Moreover, in-depth in vitro validations for VGF (Neurosecretory protein VGF) showed that siRNA-mediated gene silencing increased the radiosensitivity of DU145 and LNCaP cells. Our computational approach enabled to predict novel radioresistance driver gene candidates. Additional preclinical and clinical studies are required to further validate the role of VGF and other candidate genes as potential biomarkers for the prediction of radiotherapy responses and as potential targets for radiosensitization of prostate cancer.""","""['Michael Seifert', 'Claudia Peitzsch', 'Ielizaveta Gorodetska', 'Caroline Börner', 'Barbara Klink', 'Anna Dubrovska']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""PLoS Comput Biol""","""['Transcriptomic analyses of the radiation response in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma subclones with different radiation sensitivity: time-course gene expression profiles and gene association networks.', 'RNA-seq profiling of a radiation resistant and radiation sensitive prostate cancer cell line highlights opposing regulation of DNA repair and targets for radiosensitization.', 'Population and single‑cell transcriptome analyses reveal diverse transcriptional changes associated with radioresistance in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.', 'Targeting MicroRNAs in Prostate Cancer Radiotherapy.', 'Molecular determinants of radiosensitivity in normal and tumor tissue: A bioinformatic approach.', 'Radioresistance Mechanisms in Prostate Cancer Cell Lines Surviving Ultra-Hypo-Fractionated EBRT: Implications and Possible Clinical Applications.', 'Computational gene expression analysis reveals distinct molecular subgroups of T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia.', 'Prostate cancer in omics era.', 'SREBF2-STARD4 axis confers sorafenib resistance in hepatocellular carcinoma by regulating mitochondrial cholesterol homeostasis.', 'AKR1B10 as a Potential Novel Serum Biomarker for Breast Cancer: A Pilot Study.']"""

The molecular features, associated with the onset and progression of the disease, are under vigorous investigation. Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues are valuable resources for large-scale studies; however, their application in proteomics is limited due to protein cross-linking. In this study, the adjustment of a protocol for the proteomic analysis of FFPE tissues was performed which was followed by a pilot application on FFPE PCa clinical samples to investigate whether the optimized protocol can provide biologically relevant data for the investigation of PCa. For the optimization, FFPE mouse tissues were processed using seven protein extraction protocols including combinations of homogenization methods (beads, sonication, boiling) and buffers (SDS based and urea-thiourea based). The proteome extraction efficacy was then evaluated based on protein identifications and reproducibility using SDS electrophoresis and high resolution LC-MS/MS analysis. Comparison between the FFPE and matched fresh frozen (FF) tissues, using an optimized protocol involving protein extraction with an SDS-based buffer following beads homogenization and boiling, showed a substantial overlap in protein identifications with a strong correlation in relative abundances (rs = 0.819, p < 0.001). Next, FFPE tissues (3 sections, 15 μm each per sample) from 10 patients with PCa corresponding to tumor (GS = 6 or GS ≥ 8) and adjacent benign regions were processed with the optimized protocol. Extracted proteins were analyzed by GeLC-MS/MS followed by statistical and bioinformatics analysis. Proteins significantly deregulated between PCa GS ≥ 8 and PCa GS = 6 represented extracellular matrix organization, gluconeogenesis, and phosphorylation pathways. Proteins deregulated between cancerous and adjacent benign tissues, reflected increased translation, peptide synthesis, and protein metabolism in the former, which is consistent with the literature.

We find that directional repositioning of SP100 and TGFB3 gene loci stratifies prostate cancers of differing Gleason scores. A more peripheral position of SP100 and TGFB3 in the nucleus, compared to benign tissues, is associated with low Gleason score cancers, whereas more internal positioning correlates with higher Gleason scores. Conversely, LMNA is more internally positioned in many non-metastatic prostate cancers, while its position is indistinguishable from benign tissue in metastatic cancer. The false positive rates were relatively low, whereas, the false negative rates of single or combinations of genes were high, limiting the clinical utility of this assay in its current form.

In addition to standard clinical features, we extracted quantitative features related to biopsy core and MRI target locations predictive of tumour unilaterality.

We evaluated concordance of model-determined laterality with final surgical pathology.  Results:   A total of 173 patients were identified with biopsy coordinates and surgical pathology available. Based on CART analysis, in addition to biopsy- and MRI-confirmed disease unilaterality, patients should be further screened for cancer detected within 7 mm of midline in a 40 mL prostate, which equates to the central third of any-sized prostate by radius. The area under the curve for this DT was 0.82. Standard diagnostics and the DT correctly identified disease laterality in 73% and 80% of patients, respectively (P = 0.13). Of the patients identified as unilateral by standard diagnostics, 47% had undetected contralateral disease or were otherwise incorrectly identified.

Newly available data on congressional district-specific cancer incidence and mortality from the U.S. Cancer Statistics (USCS) database from 2011 to 2015 were used to compute MIR values for overall (all types combined), breast, cervix, colorectal, esophagus, lung, oral, pancreas, and prostate cancer. Congressional districts in the South and Midwest, including MS, AL, and KY, had higher (worse) MIR values for all cancer types combined than for the U.S. as a whole. For all cancers combined, there was a positive correlation between each district's percent of rural residents and the MIR (r = 0.47; p < .001). The MIR for all cancer types combined was lower in districts within states that expanded Medicaid vs. those states that did not expand Medicaid (0.36 vs. 0.38; p < .001). A positive correlation was seen between the proportion of non-Hispanic Black residents and MIR (r = 0.15; p < .01 for all cancers). Lower MIRs were observed in districts in New England and in states that expanded Medicaid. However, there also were some interesting departures from this rule (e.g., Wyoming, South Dakota, parts of Wisconsin and Florida). Rural congressional districts have generally higher MIRs than more urban districts. There is some concern that poorer, more rural states that did not expand Medicaid may experience greater disparities in MIRs relative to Medicaid expansion states in the future.""","""['Jan M Eberth', 'Whitney E Zahnd', 'Swann Arp Adams', 'Daniela B Friedman', 'Stephanie B Wheeler', 'James R Hébert']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Prev Med""","""['Progress in reducing cancer mortality in the United States by congressional district, 1996-2003 to 2012-2020.', 'Medicaid Coverage Expansion and Implications for Cancer Disparities.', 'Mapping cancer mortality-to-incidence ratios to illustrate racial and sex disparities in a high-risk population.', 'Cancer death rates in US congressional districts.', 'The Health System and Policy Implications of Changing Epidemiology for Oral Cavity and Oropharyngeal Cancers in the United States From 1995 to 2016.', 'Self-reported Racial Discrimination and Healthy Behaviors in Black Adults Residing in Rural Persistent Poverty Areas.', 'Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on cancer patients in western Pennsylvania: rural-urban disparities.', 'Impact of the Affordable Care Act on Presentation, Treatment, and Outcomes of Intrahepatic Cholangiocarcinoma.', 'Surveillance of the Incidence and Mortality of Oral and Pharyngeal, Esophageal, and Lung Cancer in Nevada: Potential Implications of the Nevada Indoor Clean Air Act.', 'Favorable Lip and Oral Cancer Mortality-to-Incidence Ratios in Countries with High Human Development Index and Expenditures on Health.']"""

Our study was designed to explore the impact of MDM2 overexpression on the levels of various cell cycle regulatory proteins including Aurora kinase-B (AURK-B), CDC25C and CDK1, which are known to promote tumor progression and increase metastatic potential. Our data from human cell cycle RT2 profiler PCR array experiments revealed significant changes in the expression profile of genes that are involved in different phases of cell cycle regulation in LNCaP-MST (MDM2 transfected) prostate cancer cells. Our current study has demonstrated a significant increase in the expression level of AURK-B, CDC25C, Cyclin A2, Cyclin B and CDK1 in LNCaP-MST cells as compared with wild type LNCaP cells that were modulated by MDM2 specific inhibitor Nutlin-3. In fact, the expression levels of the above- mentioned proteins were significantly altered at both mRNA and protein levels after treating the cells with 20 μM Nutlin-3 for 24h. Additionally, the pro-apoptotic proteins including p53, p21, and Bax were elevated with the concomitant decrease in the key anti-apoptotic proteins following MDM2 inhibitor treatment. Also, Nutlin-3 treated cells demonstrated caspase-3 activation was observed with an in-vitro caspase-3 fluorescent assay performed with caspase 3/7 specific DEVD-amc substrate. Our results offer significant evidence towards the effectiveness of MDM2 inhibition in causing cell cycle arrest via blocking the transmission of signals through AURKB-CDK1 axis and inducing apoptosis in LNCaP-MST cancer cells. It is evident from our data that MDM2 overexpression probably is the primary cause for CDK1 up-regulation in the LNCaP-MST cells, which might have occurred possibly through activation of AURK-B. However, further studies in this direction should shed more light on the intracellular mechanisms involved in the regulation of Aurora kinase-B and CDK1 axis in MDM2 positive cancers.""","""['Thanigaivelan Kanagasabai', 'Thiagarajan Venkatesan', 'Umamaheswari Natarajan', 'Saad Alobid', 'Khalid Alhazzani', 'Mohammad Algahtani', 'Appu Rathinavelu']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Cell Signal""","""['Inhibition of p53-murine double minute 2 interaction by nutlin-3A stabilizes p53 and induces cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in Hodgkin lymphoma.', 'Cell Cycle Arrest and Cytotoxic Effects of SAHA and RG7388 Mediated through p21WAF1/CIP1 and p27KIP1 in Cancer Cells.', 'Concomitant inhibition of Mdm2-p53 interaction and Aurora kinases activates the p53-dependent postmitotic checkpoints and synergistically induces p53-mediated mitochondrial apoptosis along with reduced endoreduplication in acute myelogenous leukemia.', 'Restoration of p53 pathway by nutlin-3 induces cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in human rhabdomyosarcoma cells.', 'Aurora-A: a potential DNA repair modulator.', 'Effect of the HDAC Inhibitor on Histone Acetylation and Methyltransferases in A2780 Ovarian Cancer Cells.', 'Aurora Kinase B Inhibition: A Potential Therapeutic Strategy for Cancer.', 'Aurora Kinase B Expression, Its Regulation and Therapeutic Targeting in Human Retinoblastoma.', 'Targeting Aurora B kinase with Tanshinone IIA suppresses tumor growth and overcomes radioresistance.', 'Long interspersed element-1 ribonucleoprotein particles protect telomeric ends in alternative lengthening of telomeres dependent cells.']"""

Comprehensive analysis of 69 patient CTCs and 72 cfDNA samples from 93 men with mCRPC, including 64 paired samples, identified common concordant gains in FOXA1, AR, and MYC, and losses in BRCA1, PTEN, and RB1 between CTCs and cfDNA. Concordant PTEN loss and discordant BRCA2 gain were associated with significantly worse outcomes in Epic AR-V7 negative men with mCRPC treated with abiraterone/enzalutamide. We identified and externally validated CTC-specific genomic alternations that were discordant in paired cfDNA, even in samples with high tumor content. These CTC/cfDNA-discordant regions included key genomic regulators of lineage plasticity, osteomimicry, and cellular differentiation, including MYCN gain in CTCs (31%) that was rarely detected in cfDNA. CTC MYCN gain was associated with poor clinical outcomes in AR-V7 negative men and small cell transformation.

Results:   Pre-treatment demography was similar between the 30 HG patients and 362 WG controls. Post-implant dosimetry was similar for the prostate gland target volumes and significantly reduced for the urethra and bowel in HG patients relative to WG controls, but this did not translate into a difference in post-implant mean symptom scores between the two groups. Nevertheless, the change in score from baseline indicated that the impact on pre-treatment symptom status was less after HG implants. Only HG patients showed a return to baseline urinary scores as early as 12 months. Sexual potency was conserved in 73% and 67% of HG and WG patients, respectively (P = 0.84). Post-implant prostate-specific antigen (PSA) kinetics revealed that baseline PSA was reduced at 24 months by 78% and 88% in HG and WG patients, respectively (P < 0.05).

Null associations were also observed by disease stage, grade and fatality, except for positive associations observed for intake of dry cakes/biscuits with low-grade and butter with aggressive prostate cancer, respectively, out of which the intake of dry cakes/biscuits was replicated in the NLCS.  Conclusions:   Our findings provide little support for an association for the majority of the 92 examined dietary factors and risk of prostate cancer. The association of dry cakes/biscuits with low-grade prostate cancer warrants further replication given the scarcity in the literature.""","""['Nikos Papadimitriou', 'David Muller', 'Piet A van den Brandt', 'Milan Geybels', 'Chirag J Patel', 'Marc J Gunter', 'David S Lopez', 'Timothy J Key', 'Aurora Perez-Cornago', 'Pietro Ferrari', 'Paolo Vineis', 'Elisabete Weiderpass', 'Heiner Boeing', 'Antonio Agudo', 'María-José Sánchez', 'Kim Overvad', 'Tilman Kühn', 'Renee T Fortner', 'Domenico Palli', 'Isabel Drake', 'Anders Bjartell', 'Carmen Santiuste', 'Bas H Bueno-de-Mesquita', 'Vittorio Krogh', 'Anne Tjønneland', 'Dorthe Furstrand Lauritzen', 'Aurelio Barricarte Gurrea', 'José Ramón Quirós', 'Pär Stattin', 'Antonia Trichopoulou', 'Georgia Martimianaki', 'Anna Karakatsani', 'Elin Thysell', 'Ingegerd Johansson', 'Fulvio Ricceri', 'Rosario Tumino', 'Nerea Larrañaga', 'Kay Tee Khaw', 'Elio Riboli', 'Ioanna Tzoulaki', 'Konstantinos K Tsilidis']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Eur J Nutr""","""['Diet-wide association study of 92 foods and nutrients and lung cancer risk in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition study and the Netherlands Cohort Study.', 'Nutrient-wide association study of 57 foods/nutrients and epithelial ovarian cancer in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition study and the Netherlands Cohort Study.', 'Nutrient-wide association study of 92 foods and nutrients and breast cancer risk.', 'A Prospective Diet-Wide Association Study for Risk of Colorectal Cancer in EPIC.', 'Dietary Patterns and Breast, Colorectal, Lung, and Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Review Internet.', 'Diet-wide association study of 92 foods and nutrients and lung cancer risk in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition study and the Netherlands Cohort Study.', 'Biscuit consumption and diabetic retinopathy incidence in adults in the United States.', 'Effect of reducing ultraprocessed food consumption on obesity among US children and adolescents aged 7-18 years: evidence from a simulation model.', 'Evidence Update on the Relationship between Diet and the Most Common Cancers from the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) Study: A Systematic Review.', 'Clinical laboratory tests associated with survival in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma: A Laboratory Wide Association Study (LWAS).']"""

However, reports about PTKs in treating prostate cancer are few. Elevated expression of the erythropoietin-producing hepatocellular receptor A2 (EPHA2) receptor tyrosine kinase, a transmembrane protein, is associated with poor prognosis of certain cancer types when the enzyme is dephosphorylated. This study investigated whether EPHA2 is useful in predicting the biochemical recurrence of prostate cancer.  Patients and methods:   Data from 241 patients who had undergone total prostatectomy between 2007 and 2011 were used. EPHA2 protein expression was categorized as high or low by two pathologists. The relationship was examined between EPHA2 expression level (high vs. low) and clinicopathological factors including biochemical recurrence. Correlations were examined between EPHA2, low-molecular-weight protein tyrosine phosphatase (LMW-PTP), E-cadherin, and Ki-67.  Results:   EPHA2 expression was high in 121 (50.2%) and low in 120 (49.8%) patients. A log-rank test revealed early biochemical recurrence in the high-expression group. Gleason score, Ki-67 labeling index, and biochemical recurrence were more frequent in the high-expression group. Furthermore, multivariate analyses revealed that high EPHA2 expression was an independent prognostic factor for biochemical recurrence (hazard ratio=3.62, 95% confidence interval=2.39-5.61). Correlations between EPHA2 and both LMW-PTP and Ki-67 labeling index were positive, whereas EPHA2 and E-cadherin were negatively correlated.  Conclusion:   EPHA2 overexpression is predictive of aggressive prostate cancer behavior. EPHA2 may be a powerful prognostic biomarker for decision-making in postoperative follow-up after total prostatectomy, and regarding the need for palliative treatment. Additionally, it may be an important therapeutic target.""","""['Hirofumi Kurose', 'Kosuke Ueda', 'Reiichiro Kondo', 'Sachiko Ogasawara', 'Hironori Kusano', 'Sakiko Sanada', 'Yoshiki Naito', 'Makoto Nakiri', 'Kiyoaki Nishihara', 'Tatsuyuki Kakuma', 'Jun Akiba', 'Tsukasa Igawa', 'Hirohisa Yano']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Anticancer Res""","""['Low-molecular-weight Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase Is a Possible Biomarker for Predicting Postoperative Biochemical Recurrence in Prostate Cancer With Negative Surgical Margins.', 'PPM1D as a novel biomarker for prostate cancer after radical prostatectomy.', 'Utility of tissue microarrays for profiling prognostic biomarkers in clinically localized prostate cancer: the expression of BCL-2, E-cadherin, Ki-67 and p53 as predictors of biochemical failure after radical prostatectomy with nested control for clinical and pathological risk factors.', 'The EphA2 and cancer connection: potential for immune-based interventions.', 'Targeting EphA2 in cancer.', 'Targeting the KLF5-EphA2 axis can restrain cancer stemness and overcome chemoresistance in basal-like breast cancer.', 'Single-cell RNA sequencing reveals intratumoral heterogeneity and potential mechanisms of malignant progression in prostate cancer with perineural invasion.', 'Non-canonical EphA2 activation underpins PTEN-mediated metastatic migration and poor clinical outcome in prostate cancer.', 'Targeting Protein Kinases and Epigenetic Control as Combinatorial Therapy Options for Advanced Prostate Cancer Treatment.', 'Mechanisms of vasculogenic mimicry in hypoxic tumor microenvironments.']"""

However, many treatments that extend survival have been approved in the past decade.  Objective:   To describe the patient demographics, disease characteristics, treatment patterns, and outcomes in a cohort of Veterans diagnosed with mCRPC in the Veterans Health Administration.  Design:   We identified 3,637 Veterans diagnosed with prostate cancer between January 2006 and August 2015 with evidence of mCRPC through December 2016. We described the most commonly used systemic mCRPC treatments according to mCRPC diagnosis era: Epoch 1 (2006-2010) or Epoch 2 (2011-2016). Patient demographics, disease characteristics, and treatment patterns were examined using descriptive statistics. An unadjusted Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate the median time to biochemical progression and overall survival (OS) with 95% confidence intervals.  Results:   The median age at initial prostate cancer diagnosis was 68 years. Approximately 67% of patients were non-Hispanic white, 29% were black, and 4% were other/unknown. A high-risk Gleason score (8-10) was reported in 748 (67%) of patients in Epoch 1 and 1578 (63%) of patients in Epoch 2, and the median prostate-specific antigen level at initial prostate cancer diagnosis was higher in Epoch 1 patients than in Epoch 2 patients (68 vs. 35 ng/ml). Following mCRPC diagnosis, the most common first-line therapies in Epoch 1 patients were docetaxel (83%) and abiraterone (9%), whereas Epoch 2 patients mainly received abiraterone (47%), docetaxel (36%), and enzalutamide (15%). In Epoch 1 and Epoch 2 patients, the median time to biochemical progression (unadjusted) was 9 and 13 months, respectively, and the median OS (unadjusted) was 15 and 23 months, respectively.  Conclusions:   The introduction of new therapies has resulted in increased use of the noncytotoxic agents abiraterone and enzalutamide as first-line treatment in lieu of docetaxel.

However, these strategies will have little impact in improving cancer outcomes if the targeted symptoms represent advanced stage of disease. Therefore, we aimed to examine associations between common presenting symptoms of cancer and stage at diagnosis.  Methods:   In this cross-sectional study, we analysed population-level data from the English National Cancer Diagnosis Audit 2014 for patients aged 25 years and older with one of 12 types of solid tumours (bladder, breast, colon, endometrial, laryngeal, lung, melanoma, oral or oropharyngeal, ovarian, prostate, rectal, and renal cancer). We considered 20 common presenting symptoms and examined their associations with stage at diagnosis (TNM stage IV vs stage I-III) using logistic regression. For each symptom, we estimated these associations when reported as a single presenting symptom and when reported together with other symptoms.  Findings:   We analysed data for 7997 patients. The proportion of patients diagnosed with stage IV cancer varied substantially by presenting symptom, from 1% (95% CI 1-3; eight of 584 patients) for abnormal mole to 80% (71-87; 84 of 105 patients) for neck lump. Three of the examined symptoms (neck lump, chest pain, and back pain) were consistently associated with increased odds of stage IV cancer, whether reported alone or with other symptoms, whereas the opposite was true for abnormal mole, breast lump, postmenopausal bleeding, and rectal bleeding. For 13 of the 20 symptoms (abnormal mole, breast lump, post-menopausal bleeding, rectal bleeding, lower urinary tract symptoms, haematuria, change in bowel habit, hoarseness, fatigue, abdominal pain, lower abdominal pain, weight loss, and the ""any other symptom"" category), more than 50% of patients were diagnosed at stages other than stage IV; for 19 of the 20 studied symptoms (all except for neck lump), more than a third of patients were diagnosed at stages other than stage IV.  Interpretation:   Despite specific presenting symptoms being more strongly associated with advanced stage at diagnosis than others, for most symptoms, large proportions of patients are diagnosed at stages other than stage IV. These findings provide support for early diagnosis interventions targeting common cancer symptoms, countering concerns that they might be simply expediting the detection of advanced stage disease.

The Evidence Academy model (Rohweder et al., 2016), developed and first used in North Carolina, is a pragmatic, action-oriented model that aims to shorten this timeline by communicating cutting-edge findings directly to those who can use them and convening individuals working in a single topic area to network and plan activities for the future. The University of Pennsylvania Collaborating Center of the Cancer Prevention and Control Research Network (CPCRN) held three conferences based on the Evidence Academy model: one about prostate cancer in 2015, a second on food access and obesity prevention in 2017, and a third about tobacco control science in 2018. A diverse planning committee of stakeholders helped shape the content, focus,and format of each conference. Local and national experts presented findings to regional audiences of researchers, practitioners, government leaders, and community members. Each Evidence Academy included collaborators and speakers from other Prevention Research Centers (PRCs) and CPCRN network sites. Evaluations and outcomes indicated that the events were successful in achieving their goals and fostered ongoing relationships among attendees. This paper illustrates how the Evidence Academy model was used in a different region and describes lessons learned and follow-up activities that were initiated via the Evidence Academy and with input from participants.

Therefore, we conducted a meta-analysis to compare clinical outcomes of hypofractionated radiotherapy versus conventional radiotherapy in the treatment of intermediate- to high-risk localized prostate cancer.  Methods:   Relevant studies were identified through searching related databases till August 2018. Hazard ratio (HR) or risk ratio (RR) with its corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI) was used as pooled statistics for all analyses.  Results:   The meta-analysis results showed that overall survival (HR = 1.12, 95% CI: 0.93-1.35, p = 0.219) and prostate cancer-specific survival (HR = 1.29, 95% CI: 0.42-3.95, p = 0.661) were similar in two groups. The pooled data showed that biochemical failure was RR = 0.90, 95% CI: 0.76-1.07, p = 0.248. The incidence of acute adverse gastrointestinal events (grade ≥ 2) was higher in the hypofractionated radiotherapy (RR = 1.70, 95% CI: 1.12-2.56, p = 0.012); conversely, for late grade ≥ 2 gastrointestinal adverse events, a significant increase in the conventional radiotherapy was found (RR = 0.75, 95% CI: 0.61-0.91, p = 0.003). Acute (RR = 1.01, 95% CI: 0.89-1.15, p = 0.894) and late (RR = 0.98, 95% CI: 0.86-1.10, p = 0.692) genitourinary adverse events (grade ≥ 2) were similar for both treatment groups.

In blastic lesions immune cells were enriched for pSTAT3 and components of the JAK-STAT pathway. In lytic-type lesions, immune cells were enriched for pAKT activity and components of the PI3K-AKT pathway. Enrichment for immune checkpoints including PD-L1, B7-H4, OX40L, and IDO-1 were identified in blastic prostate cancer, providing new therapeutic targets for patients with bone metastases. Biopsies could guide selection of patients into appropriate therapeutic interventions based on protein levels and RNA expression of desired targets in metastatic disease.

As human castrate-resistant PCa shares several characteristics with the canine disease, comparative evaluation of novel therapeutic agents is of considerable value for both species. Novel isoquinolinamine FX-9 exhibits antiproliferative activity in acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell lines but has not been tested yet on any solid neoplasia type. In this study, FX-9's mediated effects were characterized on two human (PC-3, LNCaP) and two canine (CT1258, 0846) PCa cell lines, as well as benign solid tissue cells. FX-9 significantly inhibited cell viability and induced apoptosis with concentrations in the low micromolar range. Mediated effects were highly comparable between the PCa cell lines of both species, but less pronounced on non-malignant chondrocytes and fibroblasts. Interestingly, FX-9 exposure also leads to the formation and survival of enlarged multinucleated cells through mitotic slippage. Based on the results, FX-9 acts as an anti-mitotic agent with reduced cytotoxic activity in benign cells.

Methods:   A total of 112 patients with diagnosed PCa underwent 2 prostate MRI examinations (Scan1 and Scan2) performed on the same day. DWI was performed using 12 b-values (0-2000 s/mm2 ), post-processed using kurtosis function, and PCa areas were annotated using whole mount prostatectomy sections. A total of 1694 radiomic features including Sobel, Kirch, Gradient, Zernike Moments, Gabor, Haralick, CoLIAGe, Haar wavelet coefficients, 3D analogue to Laws features, 2D contours, and corner detectors were calculated. Radiomics and 4 feature pruning methods (area under the receiver operator characteristic curve, maximum relevance minimum redundancy, Spearman's ρ, Wilcoxon rank-sum) were evaluated in terms of Scan1-Scan2 repeatability using intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC)(3,1). Classification performance for clinically significant and insignificant PCa with Gleason grade groups 1 versus >1 was evaluated by area under the receiver operator characteristic curve in unseen random 30% data split.

The machine learning classifications varied between Scan1 and Scan2 with % of same class labels between Scan1 and Scan2 in the range of 61-81%. Surface-to-volume ratio and corner detector-based features were among the most represented features with high repeatability, ICC(3,1) >0.75, consistently high ranking using all 4 feature pruning methods, and classification performance with area under the receiver operator characteristic curve >0.70.

We describe the technical feasibility and urinary continence outcomes of extended prostatic urethral preservation (EPUP) during RARP.  Methods:   A single surgeon at a National Comprehensive Cancer Network institute performed 48 consecutive RARP operations using EPUP from March 2014 to March 2016, during which time 177 conventional non-EPUP RARP operations were performed by other surgeons. Prior to this period, the EPUP surgeon had performed 17 non-EPUP RARP operations over 15 months. Total intracorporeal urethral length (IUL) preserved during EPUP was measured intraoperatively. Associations of EPUP and IUL with continence recovery rates and/or times were tested in Fisher's exact and log rank univariate analyses and Cox logistic regression multivariable analyses.  Results:   Median IUL preserved during EPUP was 4.0 cm (range 2.5-6.0 cm), and urethral dissections typically spanned the prostatic apex to mid-gland or base. Seven-week continence rates were significantly higher with versus without EPUP. EPUP patient rates of using 0 or 0-1 pads per day immediately after catheter removal were 19% and 35%, respectively. These rates increased significantly (53% and 76%, respectively), as did the IUL preserved (median 5.0 cm), among more recent EPUP patients (n = 17), which suggested a learning curve. In multivariable analyses including all patients, an EPUP approach was an independent predictor of faster continence recovery. In multivariable analyses of the EPUP subset, a longer IUL preserved was independently associated with faster continence recovery. No EPUP patient had a urethral fossa positive margin, and apical positive margins were similarly infrequent among EPUP and non-EPUP patients.  Conclusions:   EPUP is technically feasible during RARP and associated with faster continence recovery. Future investigation into the generalizability of these findings and the oncologic safety of EPUP is warranted.""","""['Luciano A Nunez Bragayrac', 'Ahmed A Hussein', 'Kristopher Attwood', 'Elena Pop', 'Gaybrielle James', 'Jennifer Osei', 'Christine Murekeysoni', 'Eric C Kauffman']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Prostate Cancer Prostatic Dis""","""['A Pragmatic Randomized Controlled Trial Examining the Impact of the Retzius-sparing Approach on Early Urinary Continence Recovery After Robot-assisted Radical Prostatectomy.', 'Retzius-sparing Robot-assisted Radical Prostatectomy Leads to Durable Improvement in Urinary Function and Quality of Life Versus Standard Robot-assisted Radical Prostatectomy Without Compromise on Oncologic Efficacy: Single-surgeon Series and Step-by-step Guide.', 'Integrity of the Urethral Sphincter Complex, Nerve-sparing, and Long-term Continence Status after Robotic-assisted Radical Prostatectomy.', 'Retzius Sparing Radical Prostatectomy Versus Robot-assisted Radical Prostatectomy: Which Technique Is More Beneficial for Prostate Cancer Patients (MASTER Study)?

Setting:   A single National Health Service trust in the South West of England, UK.  Participants:   Those with localised prostate cancer and listed for radical prostatectomy were invited to participate.  Randomisation:   Random allocation was performed by the Bristol Randomised Trial Collaboration via an online system.  Interventions:   Men were randomised into both a modified nutrition group (either increased vegetable and fruit, and reduced dairy milk; or lycopene supplementation; or control) and a physical activity group (brisk walking or control) for 6 months.  Blinding:   Only the trial statistician was blind to allocations.  Primary outcome measures:   Primary outcomes were measures of feasibility: randomisation rates and intervention adherence at 6 months. Collected at trial baseline, three and six months, with daily adherence reported throughout. Our intended adherence rate was 75% or above, the threshold for acceptable adherence was 90%.

We sought to examine this issue in the context of stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) by studying how its use for an established indication (lung cancer) impacts its use for an emerging indication (prostate cancer).  Methods:   Using SEER-Medicare from 2007 to 2011, we developed prostate cancer-specific physician-hospital networks. Our primary dependent variable was SBRT use for prostate cancer and our primary independent variable was SBRT use for lung cancer, both at the network level. To assess the influence of SBRT availability and experiential use, we generated predicted probabilities of SBRT use for prostate cancer stratified by a network's use of lung cancer SBRT, adjusting for network characteristics. To assess intensity of use, we examined the correlation between the proportion of prostate cancer patients and lung cancer patients receiving SBRT within a network.  Results:   We identified 316 networks that served 41,034 prostate cancer and 83,433 lung cancer patients. A network was significantly more likely to use SBRT for prostate cancer if that network used SBRT for lung cancer (e.g., in 2011, odds ratio [OR] 12.7; 95% confidence interval [CI] 3.9-41.8). The Pearson's correlation between the proportion of prostate cancer patients and lung cancer patients receiving SBRT in a network was 0.34, which was not statistically significant (P = 0.12).

Here, we assessed the role of HSF1 expression in relation to copy number alteration (CNA) and cancer prognosis.  Methods:   Using 10,287 cancer genomes from The Cancer Genome Atlas and Cbioportal databases, we assessed the association of HSF1 expression with CNA and cancer prognosis. CNA of 8q24.3 was categorized as diploid (reference), deletion (fewer copies), gain (+ 1 copy) and amplification (≥ + 2 copies). Multivariate logistic regression modeling was used to assess 5-year survival among those with a first cancer diagnosis and complete follow-up data (N = 9568), categorized per anatomical location and histology, assessing interaction with tumor stage, and expressed as odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals.  Results:   We found that only 54.1% of all tumors have a normal predicted 8q24.3 copy number and that 8q24.3 located genes including HSF1 are mainly overexpressed due to increased copies number of 8q24.3 in different cancers. The tumor of patients having respectively gain (+ 1 copy) and amplification (≥ + 2 copies) of 8q24.3 display a global increase of 5-year mortality (odds ratio = 1.98, 95% CI 1.22-3.21) and (OR = 2.19, 1.13-4.26) after full adjustment. For separate cancer types, tumor patients with 8q24.3 deletion showed a marked increase of 5-year mortality in uterine (OR = 4.84, [2.75-8.51]), colorectal (OR = 4.12, [1.15-14.82]), and ovarian (OR = 1.83, [1.39-2.41]) cancers; and decreased mortality in kidney cancer (OR = 0.41, [0.21-0.82]). Gain of 8q24.3 resulted in significant mortality changes in 5-year mortality for cancer of the uterus (OR = 3.67, [2.03-6.66]), lung (OR = 1.76, [1.24-2.51]), colorectal (OR = 1.75, [1.32-2.31]) cancers; and amplification for uterine (OR = 4.58, [1.43-14.65]), prostate (OR = 4.41 [3.41-5.71]), head and neck (OR = 2.68, [2.17-3.30]), and stomach (OR = 0.56, [0.36-0.87]) cancers.  Conclusions:   Here, we show that CNAs of 8q24.3 genes, including HSF1, are tightly linked to 8q24.3 copy number in tumor patients and can affect patient outcome.

Twenty-nine patients who underwent prostate stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT), with four implanted cylindrical gold fiducial markers (FMs), had cine-MR imaging sessions after each of five weekly fractions. Each cine-MR session consisted of 55 sequentially obtained 3D data sets ('dynamics') and was acquired over an 11 s period, covering a total of 10 min. The prostate was delineated on the first dynamic of every dataset and this delineation was used as the starting position for the soft tissue tracking (SST). Each subsequent dynamic was rigidly aligned to the first dynamic, based on the contrast of the prostate. The obtained translation and rotation describes the intrafraction motion of the prostate. The algorithm was applied to 6270 dynamics over 114 scans of 29 patients and the results were validated by comparing to previously obtained fiducial marker tracking data of the same dataset.

A 54-year-old male presented with recurrent attacks of acute urinary retention. Laboratory findings showed high creatinine and a serum prostate specific antigen of 50.7 μg/L. Magnetic Resonance Imaging showed a locally advanced tumor involving the bladder and extending to the base of prostate with bilateral ureterovesical junction involvement and invasion of the left seminal vesicle and left anterior mesorectal fascia as well as perirectal fat invasion. Diffuse metastases to the abdominopelvic lymph nodes were identified. Bone scintigraphy showed multiple bone metastases. Transrectal ultrasound guided biopsy of the prostate was attempted but the patient could not tolerate the procedure and the procedure was canceled. The patient then underwent transurethral resection of bladder tumor. Microscopic examination showed sheets of malignant cells with prominent plasmacytoid appearance undermining benign urothelium. The tumor cells were positive for PSA, PSAP, NKX 3.1 and Cytokeratin 8/18. The tumor cells were negative for P63, Cytokeratin 34βE12, Cytokeratin 20, Desmin, CD38, Kappa and Lambda light chains, Chromogranin, Synaptophysin, GATA 3, E-cadherin and CD45. INI1 was retained. Next generation sequencing showed an intermediate tumor mutational burden. Notably, no genomic alterations in the CDH1 gene (encoding for E-cadherin) were present. The patient showed some initial response to antiandrogen therapy with a drop in serum PSA levels following androgen deprivation therapy. However, the patient died 6 months after diagnosis.

We tried to investigate clinical association of Ki-67 (MIB-1) expression with the oncological outcomes in patients with localized prostate cancer (PCa) after the radical prostatectomy (RP).  Materials and methods:   We retrospectively analyzed the data of 1,561 patients who underwent RP for localized PCa.

Results:   After propensity score matching, positive Ki-67 group showed significant worse clinical characteristics and pathologic outcomes than negative Ki-67 group. The multivariate analysis showed that the Ki-67 expression was significantly associated with several adverse pathologic outcomes including higher pathologic stage (p = 0.006), higher grade group (p = 0.005), seminal vesicle invasion (p = 0.036), and positive surgical margin (p = 0.025).

The low expression of STEAP2 was detected in breast cancer tissues, which was associated with malignant phenotype and poor prognosis of breast cancer. The public databases analyses were consistent with our findings. STEAP2 up-regulation hindered cellular proliferation, invasion and metastasis abilities by inhibiting EMT process and suppressing PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway. On the other hand, STEAP2 down-regulation could promote cell proliferation and invasion by inducing EMT and activating the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway.

Patients and methods:   Quantitative Real Time-Polymerase Chain Reaction (qRT-PCR) was applied to detect the miR-605-3p expression in 52 pairs of Prostate Cancer (PCa) tissues and normal tissues, and to analyze the relationship between miR-605-3p expression and PCa pathological parameters. MiR-605-3p mimics were transfected into PCa cell line PC-3 and DU145 to achieve miR-605-3p overexpression. Then, Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8), cell colony formation assay and transwell invasion and migration assay were performed to analyze miR-605-3p's effect on the biological function of prostate cancer cells. Finally, the potential mechanisms of downstream genes were explored through bioinformatics analysis and recovery experiments.  Results:   We found that miR-605-3p expression in PCa was markedly lower than that in normal tissues. Patients with low miR-605-3p expression had higher tumor stage, higher incidence of lymph node metastasis and distant metastasis. In vitro analysis showed that miR-605-3p overexpression leads to a significant decrease in cell proliferation, invasion and migration ability. Subsequently, it was verified in cell line and tissue that EZH2 expression was remarkably increased in PCa, which was negatively correlated with miR-605-3p expression.

To test for cancer-specific mortality (CSM) differences among Native American vs. CAP, the most contemporary version of the SEER database (Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database [2004-2016]) was used.  Methods:   Descriptives and time trend analyses focused on a combined cohort of 357,289 Caucasian and Native American PCa patients of all stages. After 1:4 propensity-score (PS) matching for stage, grade, and other patient characteristics, cumulative incidence plots, and competing-risks-regression-models (CRR) were used, with further stratification according to non-metastatic (TanyN0M0) vs. metastatic (TanyN1 and/or M1) stages.  Results:   Native American patients accounted for 1804 (0.5%) of the study cohort. Native American patients had higher PSA (8 ng/ml vs. 6.3 ng/ml), higher rate of D'Amico high-risk PCa (30.8 vs. 24.8%), higher rate of T3/T4-PCa (5.5 vs. 3.7%), higher rate of N1 stage (4.5 vs. 2.8%), and higher rate of M1 stage (7.5 vs. 3.9%, all p < 0.001) than CAP. In TanyN0M0 patients after PS-matching, 10-year CSM was 5.7 vs. 6.2% in Native American vs. CAP. In TanyN1 and/or M1 patients, 10-year CSM was 64.3 vs. 63.3% in Native American vs. CAP, (both p = 0.8). In CRR, Native American race did not represent an independent predictor of CSM.  Conclusions:   Native American patients have more unfavorable stage and grade at presentation. However, after adjustment for these characteristics, CSM in Native American patients is not higher than in CAP.

Microarray profiling, STRING analysis, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway annotation, and Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis were performed to confirm the candidate genes and long non-coding RNA (lncRNAs) related to BPH. Collagen Type III (COL3A1) was significantly upregulated by TGFβ1 in prostate stromal cells (PrSCs) and might be involved in DNM3OS function in myofibroblasts upon TGFβ1 stimulation. Upon TGFβ1 stimulation, COL3A1 protein was decreased by DNM3OS silencing. miR-29a and miR-29b could directly bind to the DNM3OS and COL3A1 3' untranslated region (UTR)s to negatively regulate their expression, and by serving as a competing endogenous RNAs (ceRNA), DNM3OS competed with COL3A1 for miR-29a/29b binding, therefore counteracting miR-29a/29b-mediated COL3A1 suppression. The effect of DNM3OS silencing on ECM components and TGFβ1 downstream signaling was similar to that of the TGFβ1 inhibitor SB431542. miR-361 could target DNM3OS and TGFβ1; DNM3OS competed for miR-361 binding to counteract miR-361-mediated TGFβ1 suppression. In conclusion, we identified DNM3OS as a specifically-upregulated lncRNA upon TGFβ1 stimulation in PrSCs; by serving as a ceRNA for the miR-29a/29b cluster and miR-361, DNM3OS eliminated miRNA-mediated suppression of COL3A1 and TGFβ1, thereby promoting TGFβ1-induced PrSC transformation into myofibroblasts.""","""['Ruizhe Wang', 'Mengda Zhang', 'Zhenyu Ou', 'Wei He', 'Lingxiao Chen', 'Junjie Zhang', 'Yao He', 'Ran Xu', 'Shusuan Jiang', 'Lin Qi', 'Long Wang']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Aging (Albany NY)""","""['LncRNA H19 Drives Proliferation of Cardiac Fibroblasts and Collagen Production via Suppression of the miR-29a-3p/miR-29b-3p-VEGFA/TGF-β Axis.', 'Long noncoding RNA H19 accelerates tenogenic differentiation and promotes tendon healing through targeting miR-29b-3p and activating TGF-β1 signaling.', 'Long non-coding RNA RNF7 promotes the cardiac fibrosis in rat model via miR-543/THBS1 axis and TGFβ1 activation.', 'The role of miR-29 family in disease.', 'The miR-29 family: genomics, cell biology, and relevance to renal and cardiovascular injury.', 'Upregulation of mir-1199-5p is associated with reduced type 2 5-α reductase expression in benign prostatic hyperplasia.', 'RNA sequencing and integrative analysis reveal pathways and hub genes associated with TGFβ1 stimulation on prostatic stromal cells.', ""DNM3OS regulates GAPDH expression and influences the molecular pathogenesis of Huntington's disease."", 'Cellular senescence as a possible link between prostate diseases of the ageing male.', 'Integrated analysis of long non-coding RNAs and mRNAs associated with malignant transformation of gastrointestinal stromal tumors.']"""

CARMIL1 and 2 proteins are capping protein (CP) interactants and multidomain regulators of actin-based mobility. However, CARMIL3's function has not been explored. Through bioinformatic metadata analysis, we find that high CARMIL3 expression correlates with poor survival of patients with breast and prostate cancer. Functional studies in murine and xenograft tumor models by targeted diminution of CARMIL3 expression or forced expression demonstrate that CARMIL3 is vitally important for tumor metastasis, especially for metastatic colonization. Consistent with a predominantly cell-intrinsic mode of action, CARMIL3 is also crucial for tumor cell migration and invasion in vitro. Coimmunoprecipitation coupled with mass spectrometric analyses identifies a group of CARMIL3-interacting proteins, including capping protein, that are involved in actin cytoskeletal organization, which is required for cell polarization and focal adhesion formation. Moreover, molecular pathway enrichment analysis reveals that lack of CARMIL3 leads to loss of cell adhesions and low CARMIL3 expression in breast cancer patient specimens is implicated in epithelial-mesenchymal transition. We also find that CARMIL3 sustains adherens junction between tumor cells. This is accomplished by CARMIL3 maintaining E-cadherin transcription downstream of HDACs through inhibiting ZEB2 protein level, also via protecting β-catenin from ubiquitination-mediated degradation initiated by the destruction complex.

These beam models were used to recalculate treatment plans of different complexity. Treatment plans using stereotactic 3D-conformal (s3D-CRT) for brain metastasis as well as VMAT plans for head and neck and prostate cancer patients were generated. Dose distributions calculated with the MBM and the OBM were compared to measured dose distributions acquired using film dosimetry and a 2D-detector-array. For the s3D-CRT plans the calculated and measured dose at the isocenter was evaluated. For VMAT, gamma pass rates (GPRs) were calculated using global gamma index with 3%/3 mm, 2%/3 mm, 1%/3 mm and 2%/2 mm with a 20% threshold. Contribution of small fields to the total fluence was expressed as the ratio (F) of fluence trough leaf openings smaller than 2 cm to the total fluence.Results: Using film dosimetry for the s3D-CRT plans, the average of the ratio of calculated dose to measured dose at the isocenter was 1.01 and 1.06 for the OBM and MBM model, respectively.

Methods: The clinical data of 80 patients with prostate cancer with lower urinary tract symptoms and receiving drug endocrine therapy in Guizhou Provincial People's Hospital from March 2015 to June 2019 were analyzed retrospectively. All patients were followed up, and the mode of administration of the endocrine therapy, the time of administration, and the international prostate symptom score (IPSS2) and quality of life score (QOL2) after treatment were recorded. The improvement of IPSS score and quality of life score after endocrine therapy was observed. The correlation between variance and age, the prostate volume, PSA, tumor stage, Gleason score, symptom severity, medication mode, and medication time were analyzed by variance, chi-square test and paired sample t test. Results: The differences of QOL and IPSS before and after therapy were statistically significant (P<0.05). Chi-square test found that the effective rate of drug endocrine therapy was not related to age (χ2=0.800; P=0.371), tumor stage (χ2=0.094; P=0.759), PSA (χ2=0.651; P=0.420), prostate volume (χ2=0.216; P=0.642), Gleason score (χ2=0.157; P=0.692), symptom severity (χ2=0.457; P=0.499), medication mode (χ2=2.910; P=0.233), and medication time (χ2=4.159; P=0.385).

This program aims to evaluate the methods and significance of prostate cancer precision screening in high risk population. Methods: A total of 2 159 eligible males enrolled from 13 community centers and 3 screening centers received PSA test from April 2017 to August 2018. Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) determination in serum with a cut-off of ≥4.0 ng/ml was the main screening test and indication for biopsy. The interviewer-administered questionnaire covered demographic characteristics and environmental exposure factors. The associations between these factors and prostate cancer risk were determined by multivariable unconditional logistic regression models. Results: Altogether, 271 cases (12.6%) had a confirmed PSA increase ≥ 4.0 μg/L (median 9.1, range 4.0-25.0). Subsequently, 57 subjects (21.0%) out of the 271 PSA-suspicious men underwent prostate biopsy, and 34 (59.6%) were confirmed as prostate cancer. Until now, the overall prostate cancer incidence in the first screening round was1.57%. There were no statistical differences in the distributions of PSA-suspicious and prostate cancer incidence between community centers and screening centers (P=0.578 and 0.735). Age (OR: 2.63; 95%CI: 1.84-3.75, P<0.001) and chronic prostatitis history (OR: 2.02; 95%CI: 1.55-2.63, P<0.001) were significantly associated with PSA level. After adjustment for these factors, older age (OR: 4.04; 95%CI: 1.71-9.59, P=0.002) and statins use (OR: 3.09; 95%CI: 1.25-7.69, P=0.015) were associated with an elevated risk of PCa. Conclusions: It is of substantial significance to screen prostate cancer in high risk population. Both community centers and screening centers methods are effective. Although largely underestimated, the incidence of PCa in the targeted Chinese population is higher than expected. Older men have a high risk of harboring PCa. Our study suggests a decreased risk of PCa in men with statins use.

We developed and validated an approach to identify SREs in men with prostate cancer using routinely-collected data.  Methods:   Patients diagnosed with prostate cancer between January 2010 and December 2013 were identified in the National Prostate Cancer Audit, based on English cancer registry data. A coding framework was developed based on diagnostic and procedure codes in linked national administrative hospital and routinely-collected radiotherapy data to identify SREs occurring before December 2015. Two coding definitions of SREs were assessed based on whether the SRE codes were paired with a bone metastasis code ('specific definition') or used in isolation ('sensitive definition'). We explored the validity of both definitions by comparing the cumulative incidence of SREs from time of diagnosis according to prostate cancer stage at diagnosis with death as a competing risk.  Results:   We identified 40,063, 25,234 and 13,968 patients diagnosed with localised, locally advanced and metastatic disease, respectively. Using the specific definition, we found that the 5-year cumulative incidence of SREs was 1.0 % in patients with localised disease, 6.0 % in patients with locally advanced disease, and 42.3 % in patients with metastatic disease. Using the sensitive definition, the corresponding cumulative incidence figures were 9.0 %, 14.9 %, and 44.4 %, respectively.

These patients had a Gleason sum (GS) of ≤6 or 3+4, prostate confined and negative margins. Pathological data analysis was performed using logistic regression modeling.  Results:   Median follow-up was 96.8 months. BCR occurred in 110 men (2.91%).

However, few systematic studies of the mechanism underlying the anti-tumor activity of Eriocalyxin B in prostate cancer cells have been published. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of Eriocalyxin B on prostate cancer cells. MATERIAL AND METHODS In the present study, the PC-3 (androgen-independent) and 22RV1 (androgen-dependent) human prostate cancer cell lines were cultured with and without increasing doses of Eriocalyxin B. MTT assay was used to measure cell viability. Western blotting was performed to measure levels of proteins associated with apoptosis and autophagy. Flow cytometry was used to assess changes in cell apoptosis and cycle. Fluorescence microscopy was used to capture images of autophagy-related proteins. RESULTS Treatment of human prostate cancer cells with Eriocalyxin B resulted in apoptosis in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Eriocalyxin B also induced autophagy, with elevated LC3B-II protein expression and punctuate patterns. Additionally, autophagy protected prostate cancer cells from apoptosis induced by Eriocalyxin B, which was demonstrated by addition of chloroquine (CQ).

We trained premedical students to administer the intervention to newly diagnosed men with low-risk prostate cancer seen at the University of California, San Francisco. Before the intervention, and after the consultation with a urologist, we administered the Decision Quality Instrument for Prostate Cancer (DQI-PC).

Background:   Specialist nurses are providing long-term survivorship care to men and their partners however, few prostate cancer survivorship interventions are effective and priorities for nurse-led survivorship care are poorly understood.  Design:   A three-round modified Delphi approach.  Methods:   The study was conducted between 1 December 2018 and 28 February 2019 to develop a consensus view from an expert nurse cohort (43 prostate cancer specialist nurses: 90% response). First, participants described men's prostate cancer survivorship experience and priorities for improving care for men and partners. In subsequent rounds, participants identified key descriptors of the survivorship experience; rated priorities for importance and feasibility; and identified a top priority action for men and for partners. Thematic analysis and descriptive statistics were applied. Guidelines for Reporting Reliability and Agreement Studies informed the conduct of the study.  Results:   Prostate cancer specialist nurses characterised the prostate cancer survivorship experience of men as under-resourced, disjointed and distressing. In all, 11 survivorship priorities for men and three for partners were identified within five broad areas: capacity building; care coordination; physical and psychosocial care; community awareness and early detection; and palliative care. However, feasibility for individual items was frequently described as low.  Conclusion:   Internationally, prostate cancer survivorship care for men and their partners requires urgent action to meet future need and address gaps in capacity and care coordination. Low feasibility of survivorship priorities may reflect translational challenges related to capacity. Prostate cancer survivorship care guidelines connected to practice priorities are urgently needed.

In the present study, we hypothesized that genetic variants in the CBP pathway genes played a role in survival of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). We tested this hypothesis using the genotyping data from the genome-wide association study (GWAS) dataset from the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer Screening Trial. In the single-locus analysis, we evaluated associations between 13 176 (1107 genotyped and 12 069 imputed) single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 72 genes and survival of 1185 patients with NSCLC. The identified 106 significant SNPs in the discovery were further validated in additional genotyping data from another GWAS dataset of 984 patients with NSCLC in the Harvard Lung Cancer Susceptibility Study. The combined results of two datasets showed that two independent, potentially functional SNPs (i.e., HDAC2 rs13213007G>A and PPARGC1A rs60571065T>A) were significantly associated with NSCLC overall survival, with a combined hazards ratio (HR) of 1.26 (95% confidence interval (CI), 1.09-1.45; P = .002) and 1.23 (1.04-1.47; P = .017), respectively. Furthermore, we performed an expression quantitative trait loci analysis and found that the survival-associated HDAC2 rs13213007A allele (GA+AA), but not PPARGC1A rs60571065A allele (TA+AA), was significantly associated with increased messenger RNA expression levels of HDAC2 in 373 lymphoblastoid cell lines.

Missed clinic appointments have undesirable effects on the patient, health system, and society, and treatment delays have been shown to result in inferior surgical cure rates for men with prostate cancer (CaP). We sought to measure the impact of patient navigation on CaP clinic adherence. Patient navigators contacted patients prior to their first encounter for known or suspected CaP between 7/1/2016 and 6/30/2017. Encounters from 7/1/2014 to 6/30/2015 were used as a historical control. Patient-variables were analyzed including age, health insurance status, home address, zip code, race, ethnicity, and referring primary care clinic. Encounter-level variables included diagnosis (categorized as known or suspected CaP), date of appointment, type of appointment [new vs. return], and provider. The associations between several factors including navigation contact and these variables with missed appointment were analyzed using generalized linear mixed effects multivariate logistic regression. A total of 2854 scheduled clinic encounters from 986 unique patients were analyzed. Patient navigation resulted in a lower missed appointment rate (8.8% vs. 13.9%, OR = 0.64, IQR 0.44-0.93, p = 0.02 on multivariable analysis).

The topological parameters of the network exhibited power law nature indicating hierarchical scale-free properties and five levels of organization. Highest degree hubs (k ≥ 65) were selected from the PCa network, traced, and 19 of them was identified as novel key regulators, as they participated at all network levels serving as backbone. Of the 19 hubs, some have been reported in literature to be associated with PCa and other cancers. Based on participation coefficient values most of these are connector or kinless hubs suggesting significant roles in modular linkage.

Initial microarray-based analysis screened out the poorly expressed lncRNA RBMS3-AS3 in prostate cancer, followed by the identification of putative binding sites with miR-4534 and its target VASH1. Therefore, the present study set out to investigate the potential role of RBMS3-AS3/miR-4534/VASH1 axis in the development of prostate cancer. The biological functions of RBMS3-AS3, miR-4534, and VASH1 on cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and angiogenesis of prostate cancer were evaluated via gain- and loss-of-function experiments. Furthermore, tumor xenograft in nude mice was performed to examine tumorigenesis in vivo. The obtained results indicated that RBMS3-AS3 was poorly expressed in prostate cancer tissues and cells. Of note, overexpression of RBMS3-AS3 was found to suppress cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and angiogenesis as well as the tumorigenic ability of prostate cancer. VASH1 was verified as a target gene of miR-4534. VASH1 expression was found to be downregulated in prostate cancer tissues and cells. Interestingly, RBMS3-AS3 was observed to competitively bind to miR-4534 to upregulate VASH1 expression, resulting in a suppressive role in prostate cancer development. Also, in vitro findings were reproduced in vivo on tumor xenograft in nude mice. Taken together, the present study provides evidence suggesting that RBMS3-AS3 acts as a miR-4534 sponge to inhibit the development of prostate cancer by upregulating VASH1, highlighting a theoretical target for prostate cancer treatment.""","""['Zhenming Jiang', 'Yuxi Zhang', 'Xi Chen', 'Pingeng Wu', 'Dong Chen']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Gene Ther""","""['LncRNA MAGI2-AS3 inhibits hepatocellular carcinoma cell proliferation and migration by targeting the miR-374b-5p/SMG1 signaling pathway.', 'A Novel lncRNA HOXC-AS3 Acts as a miR-3922-5p Sponge to Promote Breast Cancer Metastasis.', 'LncRNA MAGI2-AS3 is downregulated in non-small cell lung cancer and may be a sponge of miR-25.', 'The integrated comprehension of lncRNA HOXA-AS3 implication on human diseases.', 'Roles of lncRNA MAGI2-AS3 in human cancers.', 'LINC01088/miR-22/CDC6 Axis Regulates Prostate Cancer Progression by Activating the PI3K/AKT Pathway.', 'Pan-Cancer Analysis Reveals Functional Similarity of Three lncRNAs across Multiple Tumors.', 'Long non-coding RNA NR2F2-AS1 regulates human osteosarcoma growth and metastasis through miR-425-5p-mediated HMGB2.', 'A pyroptosis-related lncRNA signature in bladder cancer.', 'Role of RBMS3 Novel Potential Regulator of the EMT Phenomenon in Physiological and Pathological Processes.']"""

This was a prospective, observational, pilot study to examine clinical practice in a tertiary hospital regarding prewarming in 140 consecutive patients. When prewarming (pw) was performed, forced-air warming was provided in the pre-anesthesia room for 15 (pw15), 30 (pw30), or 45 (pw45) min. Tympanic temperature was recorded upon entering the pre-anesthesia room, at the time of initiating surgery, and every 15 min intra-operatively. We also recorded duration of the surgical procedure and length of stay in the Post-Anesthesia Care Unit (PACU). Pw15 was performed in 34 patients, pw30 in 29 patients, and pw45 in 21 patients. Fifty-six patients did not receive pw and 96% of them developed hypothermia at the end of the surgical procedure, compared to 73% of patients in pw15 (p = 0.002), 75% in pw30 (p = 0.006) and 90% in pw45 (p = 0.3). Length of stay in the PACU was markedly shorter in pw15 (131 ± 69 min) and pw30 (123 ± 60 min) than in the non-pw group (197 ± 105 min) (p = 0.015 and p = 0.011, respectively).

To determine the role of nuclear medicine in surgical guidance, in particular the positional guidance of a SPECT/CT-based 3-dimensional imaging road map, in this process we studied to what extent fluorescence guidance underestimated the number of target lesions relative to radioguidance. Methods: SPECT/CT imaging was performed after intraprostatic tracer administration of either indocyanine green (ICG)-99mTc-nanocolloid (hybrid-tracer group) or 99mTc-nanocolloid to create a road map that depicted all SNs. Patients who received 99mTc-nanocolloid were injected with ""free"" ICG immediately before surgery. Before unmasking, fluorescence guidance was used for intraoperative SN identification. This was followed by extended pelvic lymph node dissection (ePLND). After unmasking of the SPECT/CT images, the number of missed SNs was recorded and their resection was pursued when there was no risk of intraoperative complications. Results: Preoperative SPECT/CT revealed no differences in the SN identification rate between ICG-99mTc-nanocolloid and 99mTc-nanocolloid. However, fluorescence guidance allowed intraoperative removal of all SNs in only 40% of patients in the hybrid-tracer group and 20% of patients in the free-ICG group. Overall, 75.9% of the intraoperatively resected SNs in the hybrid-tracer group and 51.8% of the SNs in the free-ICG group were removed solely under fluorescence guidance. During ePLND, 22 additional SNs were resected (7 in the hybrid-tracer group and 15 in the free-ICG group). After unmasking, 18 remaining SNs were identified (6 in the hybrid group and 12 in the free-ICG group). In the free-ICG group, ex vivo evaluation of the excised specimens revealed that 14 SNs removed under ePLND or after unmasking contained radioactivity but no fluorescence. Conclusion: The preoperative imaging road map provided by SPECT/CT enhanced the detection of prostate SNs in more ectopic locations in 17 of the 25 patients, and the hybrid tracer ICG-99mTc-nanocolloid was shown to outperform free ICG.

Metastasis is considered to be initiated with the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) event in which tumor cells change their epithelial characteristics into mesenchymal form and exacerbates the cancer progression. Herein, we investigated the effect and mechanism of resveratrol function in PCa cell proliferation and migration and reported that TNF-receptor associated factor 6 (TRAF6), an unconventional E3 ligase, is a key mediator of resveratrol function to inhibit PCa cell growth and proliferation and targeted for lysosomal degradation by resveratrol. MTT and cell counting demonstrated that resveratrol inhibited the viability and proliferation in DU145 and PC3 cells. Resveratrol (50 μM) mediated the degradation of TRAF6 which in turn facilitated repression of the NF-κB pathway. Also, wound healing and transwell migration assays and level of EMT-related proteins showed that resveratrol used TRAF6, at least in part to inhibit cell migration. Overexpression of TRAF6 augmented EMT in PCa by upregulating the expression of transcription factor SLUG. Moreover, TRAF6 overexpression was closely associated with EMT process through the NF-κB pathway. Our exploration exhibited that resveratrol may inhibit EMT through the TRAF6/NF-κB/SLUG axis. Altogether, this study represents that TRAF6 acts as an intermediary of resveratrol action to suppress PCa cell proliferation and migration, and concerns future attention to obtain as a therapeutic target for the treatment of PCa.""","""['Farjana Yeasmin Khusbu', 'Xi Zhou', 'Mridul Roy', 'Fang-Zhi Chen', 'Qian Cao', 'Han-Chun Chen']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Int J Biochem Cell Biol""","""['Targeting the SPOCK1-snail/slug axis-mediated epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition by apigenin contributes to repression of prostate cancer metastasis.', 'Induction of the Epithelial-to-Mesenchymal Transition of Human Colorectal Cancer by Human TNF-β (Lymphotoxin) and its Reversal by Resveratrol.', 'Resveratrol suppresses epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in colorectal cancer through TGF-β1/Smads signaling pathway mediated Snail/E-cadherin expression.', 'The role of Snail in prostate cancer.', 'Resveratrol and Its Analogs: Potent Agents to Reverse Epithelial-to-Mesenchymal Transition in Tumors.', 'Anti-Cancer Potential of Phytochemicals: The Regulation of the Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition.', 'Recent progress in nanotechnology-based drug carriers for resveratrol delivery.', 'Interfering with the Ubiquitin-Mediated Regulation of Akt as a Strategy for Cancer Treatment.', 'Modulating glycosphingolipid metabolism and autophagy improves outcomes in pre-clinical models of myeloma bone disease.', 'Resveratrol suppresses serum-induced vasculogenic mimicry through impairing the EphA2/twist-VE-cadherin/AKT pathway in human prostate cancer PC-3 cells.']"""

Univariate analysis (UVA) identified features associated with lymph node metastasis (LN+), extraprostatic extension (EPE), positive surgical margins (SM+), and seminal vesicle invasion (SV+). We then assessed PDA effect on RP outcomes in a multivariate analysis (MVA).  Results:   In 127 cases PDA was present in 1 TN and no TN was pure PDA. One-hundred and twenty-three cases had PDA in TNs with highest grade, stage, and TV.

There are few reports of the incidence after robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (RALP) compared with RRP.  Objective:   The aim was to compare the risk of developing symptomatic stenosis after RRP and RALP, and to explore potential risk factors and the influence of stenosis on the risk of urinary incontinence.  Design, setting, and participants:   Between 2008 and 2011, 4003 men were included in a prospective trial comparing RRP and RALP at 14 Swedish centres. Clinical data and patient questionnaires were collected before, during, and after surgery.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Stenosis was identified by either patients' reports in questionnaires or case report forms. The primary endpoint is reported as unadjusted as well as adjusted relative risks (RRs), calculated with log-binomial regression models. Data on incontinence were analysed by means of a log-binomial regression model, with stenosis as an independent and incontinence as a dependent variable.  Results and limitations:   Symptomatic stenosis developed in 1.9% of 3706 evaluable men within 24 mo. The risk was 2.2 times higher after RRP than after RALP (RR 2.21, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.38-3.53). Overall, urinary incontinence was twice as common in patients who had stenosis (RR 2.01, 95% CI 1.43-2.64).  Conclusions:   This large prospective study found an overall low rate of vesicourethral anastomotic stenosis after radical prostatectomy, but the rate was significantly lower after robot-assisted prostatectomy. The risk of stenosis seems to be associated with the number of sutures/takes in the anastomosis, but this was statistically significant only in the RALP group.

The primary aim of this study was to identify differentially expressed proteins in seminal plasma of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) survivors compared to age-matched healthy controls, which can provide molecular basis of idiopathic infertility in such survivors. Differential proteome profiling was performed by 2D-differential in-gel electrophoresis, protein spots were identified by mass spectrometry and selective differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) were validated by western blotting and ELISA method. Out of eight DEPs identified, five proteins (isocitrate dehydrogenase 1, semenogelin 1, lactoferrin, prolactin-inducible protein, and human serum albumin) were upregulated and three (pepsinogen, prostate specific antigen and prostatic acid phosphatase) were downregulated.

Patients and methods:   We included 150 patients with PCa without hormonal therapy and 41 patients without PCa obtained from the Kyoto University Hospital between 2012 and 2017. LDN-PSA levels were measured through a WFA-anti-PSA antibody sandwich immunoassay using a highly sensitive surface plasmon field-enhanced fluorescence spectroscopy (SPFS) system. Diagnostic performance of serum LDN-PSA and LDN-PSAD was evaluated by measuring the area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUC).

Moreover, we tested the effect of CHT on overall mortality (OM), as well as on cancer-specific mortality (CSM) in this patient population.  Materials and methods:   Within the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database (2004-2016), we identified 1513 men with non-metastatic UCUB with prostatic stromal invasion who underwent radical cystectomy with lymph node dissection, with or without CHT administration. Estimated annual percentage change analyses, inverse probability of treatment-weighting (IPTW), Kaplan-Meier plots, Cox regression models, and landmark analyses were performed.  Results:   Overall, 732 (48.4%) patients with pT4a UCUB disease underwent radical cystectomy with perioperative CHT administration between 2004 and 2016. The CHT administration rate increased from 29.0% in 2004 to 64.8% in 2016 (P < .001). In IPTW-adjusted analyses, the 5-year overall survival was 47.7% versus 39.8%, and cancer-specific survival was 53.6 versus 50.1%, for with versus without CHT administration, respectively. After multivariable and IPTW-adjusted Cox regression models, administration of CHT independently predicted lower OM (hazard ratio [HR], 0.62; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.52-0.73), as well as lower CSM (HR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.55-0.80). even after 3-month landmark analyses (OM HR, 0.64; 95% CI 0.54-0.76; CSM HR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.58-0.85).

Association between elevated plasma von Willebrand factor (VWF) levels-as an endothelial activation marker-and increased risk of thrombotic events has been evidenced. We aimed to elicit new data on the VWF after RP in prostate cancer patients and explore the role of it as a thrombotic risk factor. Upon perioperative plasma VWF levels (VWF:Ag) its collagen-binding (CB) activity (VWF:CB), multimerization, and cleaving enzyme (ADAMTS13 [a disintegrin and metalloprotease with thrombospondin type repeats, motif 1, type 13]) of the VWF multimers were quantitated along with Factor VIII and routine laboratory parameters in this observational pilot study.  Methods:   Plasma samples of 24 prostate cancer patients were collected before (-1 day; D-1) and after RP (1 hour, 6 days, 1 month, and 10 months; H1, D6, M1, and M10). VWF:Ag, VWF:CB, ADAMTS13:Ag were measured by ELISA, and the multimer distribution by electrophoresis and quantitative densitometry. Factor VIII, fibrinogen, D-dimer, and other routine laboratory parameters were determined as well. Preoperative values served as baselines which were compared to controls (24 healthy individuals).  Results:   VWF:Ag and CB elevated by 122% and 143% respectively at H1 after RP then plateaued at D6 compared to baseline values. ADAMTS13/VWF:Ag ratio reduced by 41% at H1, and by 46% at D6, meanwhile the ratio of high molecular weight multimers increased as well. Values returned to baseline at M1 and further reduced to the levels of the controls at M10. All of the 24 patients at H1 and D6 and 14 at M10 were in potential prothombotic state according ROC analysis of the VWF parameters as indicators.  Conclusions:   Prostate malignancy and then surgical stress, and inflammatory reactions induced release of VWF from the endothelial cells, along with an increasing amount of large multimers and relative reduction of ADAMTS13 level. Because these changes mark a prothrombotic state even at M1 after RP, more than 1 month follow-up and prophylactic targeting through the thrombotic and inflammatory activity of the VWF is proposed. Evaluation of VWF parameters provides new information about the long-term disturbances of primary hemostasis after radical pelvic oncologic surgery like RP and might improve the understanding the physiological and pathological recovery.""","""['Jolan Harsfalvi', 'Zsuzsanna Molnar', 'Maria Cs Csanyi', 'Istvan Domjan', 'Tibor Flasko', 'Andras Kaposi', 'Matyas Benyo']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Urol Oncol""","""['Levels and activities of von Willebrand factor and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin type-1 motif, number 13 in inflammatory bowel diseases.', 'Assessment of the Diagnostic Value of Plasma Levels, Activities, and Their Ratios of von Willebrand Factor and ADAMTS13 in Patients with Cerebral Infarction.', 'Changes in ADAMTS13 (von-Willebrand-factor-cleaving protease) activity after induced release of von Willebrand factor during acute systemic inflammation.', 'Laboratory diagnosis of von Willebrand disease type 1/2E (2A subtype IIE), type 1 Vicenza and mild type 1 caused by mutations in the D3, D4, B1-B3 and C1-C2 domains of the von Willebrand factor gene.

We analyzed differences in outcome between ART and SRT in patients with steep decline of PSA-levels after surgery to compare outcome.  Methods:   We evaluated 253 patients treated with postoperative RT with a median age of 66 years (range 42-85 years) treated between 2004 and 2014. Patients with additive radiotherapy due to PSA persistence and patients in the SRT group, who did not achieve a postoperative PSA level <0.1 ng/mL were excluded. Hence, data of 179 patients was evaluated. We used propensity score matching to build homogenous groups. A Cox regression model was used to determine differences between treatment options. Median follow-up was 32.5 months (range 1.4-128.0 months).  Results:   Early SRT at PSA levels <0.3 ng/mL was associated with significant longer BCRFS than late SRT (HR: 0.32, 95%-CI: 0.14-0.75, p = 0.009). Multiple Cox regression showed pre-RT PSA level, tumor stage, and Gleason score as predictive factors for biochemical relapse. In the overall group, patients treated with either ART or early SRT showed no significant difference in BCRFS (HR: 0.17, 95%-CI: 0.02-1.44, p = 0.1). In patients with locally advanced PC (pT3/4) BCRFS was similar in both groups as well (HR: 0.21, 95%-CI:0.02-1.79, p = 0.15).  Conclusion:   For patients with PSA-triggered follow-up, close observation is essential and early initiation of local treatment at low PSA levels (<0.3 ng/mL) is beneficial. Our data suggest, that SRT administered at early PSA rise might be equieffective to postoperative ART in patients with locally advanced PC. However, the individual treatment decision must be based on any adverse risk factors and the patients' postoperative clinical condition.

This study aimed to quantify the associations between full-spectrum changes in body mass index (BMI) and the risks of colorectal cancer (CRC) incidence, cancer-related and all-cause mortality among midlife to elder population.  Methods:   A total of 81,388 participants who were free of cancer and aged 55 to 74 years from the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian (PLCO) screening program were involved. The percentage change of BMI was calculated as (BMI in 2006 - BMI at baseline)/BMI at baseline, and was categorized into nine groups: decrease (≥ 15.0%, 10.0-14.9%, 5.0-9.9%, 2.5-4.9%), stable (decrease/increase < 2.5%), increase (2.5-4.9%, 5.0-9.9%, 10.0-14.9%, ≥ 15.0%). The associations between percentage change in BMI from study enrolment to follow-up (median: 9.1 years) and the risks of CRC and mortality were evaluated using Cox proportional hazard regression models.  Results:   After 2006, there were 241 new CRC cases, 648 cancer-related deaths, and 2361 all-cause deaths identified. Overall, the associations between BMI change and CRC incidence and cancer-related mortality, respectively, were not statistically significant. Compared with participants whose BMI were stable, individuals who had a decrease in BMI were at increased risk of all-cause mortality, and the HRs were 1.21 (95% CI: 1.03-1.42), 1.65 (95% CI: 1.44-1.89), 1.84 (95% CI: 1.56-2.17), and 2.84 (95% CI: 2.42-3.35) for 2.5-4.9%, 5.0-9.9%, 10.0-14.9%, and ≥ 15.0% decrease in BMI, respectively. An L-shaped association between BMI change and all-cause mortality was observed. Every 5% decrease in BMI was associated with a 27% increase in the risk of all-cause mortality (HR = 1.27, 95% CI: 1.22-1.31, p < 0.001). The results from subgroups showed similar trends.  Conclusions:   A decrease in BMI more than 5% shows a significantly increased risk of all-cause mortality among older individuals; but no significant association between increase in BMI and all-cause mortality.

We examined the relationship between AChEI use and fracture risk in a national cohort of 360,015 male veterans aged 65 to 99 years with dementia but without prior fracture using Veterans Affairs (VA) hospital, Medicare, and pharmacy records from 2000 to 2010. Diagnosis of dementia, any clinical fracture (excluding facial and digital), comorbidities, and medications were identified using ICD-9 and drug class codes. Cox proportional hazard models considering AChEI use as a time-varying covariate and adjusting for fall and fracture risk factors compared the time-to-fracture in AChEI users versus non-AChEI users. Potential confounders included demographics (age, race, body mass index), comorbidities associated with fracture or falls (diabetes, lung disease, stroke, Parkinson's, seizures, etc.) and medications associated with fracture or falls (bisphosphonates, glucocorticoids, androgen deprivation therapy [ADT], proton pump inhibitors [PPIs], selective serotonin receptor inhibitors [SSRIs], etc.). Competing mortality risk was considered using the methods of Fine and Gray. To account for persistent effects on bone density or quality that might confer protection after stopping the medication, we completed a secondary analysis using the medication possession ratio (MPR) as a continuous variable in logistic regression models and also compared MPR increments of 10% to minimal/no use (MPR 0 to <0.10). Among older veterans with diagnosis of dementia, 20.1% suffered a fracture over an average of 4.6 years of follow-up. Overall, 42.3% of the cohort were prescribed AChEIs during the study period. The hazard of any fracture among AChEI users compared with those on other/no dementia medications was significantly lower in fully adjusted models (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.81; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.75-0.88).

In our analysis a PSA-level of > 80 µg/l could be defined as a cut-off-value for metastatic spread beyond mid-thigh, as no patient with PSA< 80 µg/l had localizations outside the SPECT/CT field-of-view (AUCPSA = 0.95, p < 0.001 sensitivity: 100 %, specificity: 77 %, NPV: 100 %, PPV: 67 %). The SPECT/CT-only protocol did not prolong acquisition time significantly as compared to BS.  Conclusions:   In patients with high-risk prostate cancer presenting with PSA < 80 µg/l and absent clinical symptoms, vertex to mid-thighs 3-FOV-SPECT/CT was representative for the entire skeletal system and was able to detect more lesions than planar acquisition.

In this study, we found that recombinant Par-4 protein had limited serum persistence in mice that may diminish its anti-tumor activity in vivo. To improve the in vivo performance of the short-lived Par-4 protein, we aimed to develop a novel, long-lasting form of Par-4 with extended sequence, denoted as Par-4Ex, without affecting the desirable molecular function of the natural Par-4. We demonstrate that the Par-4Ex protein entity, produced by using the Escherichia coli expression system suitable for large-scale production, fully retains the desirable pro-apoptotic activity of Par-4 protein, but with ~7-fold improved biological half-life.

Materials and methods:   This study was performed in the experimental treatment planning system (eTPS, V8A, Raystation, Sweden), which incorporates both MKM and LEM. CIRT plans from 10 PCA patients were collected. There were 5 steps to establish the curves: (1) design MKM plans in eTPS; (2) recalculate the physical doses from MKM to LEM and create a LEM plan in eTPS; (3) plot the RBE-weighted MKM to LEM conversion curves; (4) convert the MKM rectum constraint dose volume histogram (DVH) from NIRS to a LEM DVH; and (5) compare patients' rectum DVHs and follow-up with the converted constraint DVH.  Results:   The conversion factors for MKM doses of 0.18 Gy (RBE) to 4.55 Gy (RBE) per fraction to LEM doses were 2.72-1.06. For fraction sizes of >1 Gy (RBE), the conversion factors matched Fossati's curve and for fraction sizes of <1.00 Gy (RBE) the values were on the extrapolated Fossati's curve. A LEM rectum constraint DVH was established. Ten patients' rectum DVHs were all lower than LEM constraint DVHs. No complications were reported clinically.

However, the standard procedure of histological examination often involves complicated tissue fixation and staining, which are time-consuming and may delay the diagnosis and surgery. In this study, label-free multiphoton microscopy (MPM) was used to acquire subcellular-resolution images of unstained prostate tissues. Then, a deep learning architecture (U-net) was introduced for epithelium segmentation of prostate tissues in MPM images. The obtained segmentation results were then merged with the original MPM images to train a classification network (AlexNet) for automated Gleason grading. The developed method achieved an overall pixel accuracy of 92.3% with a mean F1 score of 0.839 for epithelium segmentation. By merging the segmentation results with the MPM images, the accuracy of Gleason grading was improved from 72.42% to 81.13% in hold-out test set.

Recently, it is well characterized that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNA) play critical roles in the initiation, development, and progression of prostate cancer. NeST, an intergenic lncRNA, was found to be a positive regulator of the pro-inflammatory cytokine, IFN-ɣ, which is responsible for both antitumor immunity properties as well as tumor evasion. FOXCUT, an-other lncRNA, is mainly a regulator of transcription factor, FOXC1 that is believed to be involved in tumor development and progression.  Methods:   In a case-control study, 66 paraffin-embedded prostate tissues representing 36 pathologically confirmed cancer and 30 control samples were examined. The cancer samples were classified in a total of three stages based on PSA levels, tumor volume, and Gleason score. RNA extraction was performed for quantitative determination of IFN-ɣ, lncRNA NeSt, and lncRNA FOXCUT gene expression in both case and control prostate tissues.  Results:   Our results showed that NeST lncRNA was significantly up-regulated in prostate cancer samples compared to control, while NeST lncRNA and IFN-ɣ gene expression was detected mainly in early stages of prostate cancer. The patients with higher NeST and FOXCUT expression had poor clinical features including PSA levels and tumor volume comparing those with lower expression. Moreover, there was a strong correlation between lncRNA FOXCUT and IFN-ɣ expression.

Prostate organoids can be established from wild-type and genetically engineered mouse models, benign human tissue, and advanced prostate cancer. Importantly, patient derived organoids closely resemble tumors in genetics and in vivo tumor biology. Moreover, organoids can be genetically manipulated using CRISPR/Cas9 and shRNA systems. These controlled genetics make the organoid culture attractive as a platform for rapidly testing the effects of genotypes and mutational profiles on pharmacological responses. However, experimental protocols must be specifically adapted to the 3D nature of organoid cultures to obtain reproducible results. Described here are detailed protocols for performing seeding assays to determine organoid formation capacity. Subsequently, this report shows how to perform drug treatments and analyze pharmacological response via viability measurements, protein isolation, and RNA isolation.

A total of 418 patients with high-risk PCa after RP were included in this study. IDC-P and its architectural patterns were identified according to the 2016 World Health Organization Classification. Chi-squared test and logistic regression were used to investigate the correlation between IDC-P and post-RP pathological features. Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox regression were applied to explore the prognostic value of IDC-P. IDC-P was identified in PBx in 36/418 (8.6%) patients. Logistic regression indicated that IDC-P in PBx was independently associated with several pathological features of RP, including Gleason score 8-10 (P < 0.001), seminal vesicular invasion (P < 0.001), and pathological T (pT) 3a (P = 0.043). Patients with IDC-P in PBx manifested poorer biochemical-free survival (BFS) than those without IDC-P (37.47 months vs not reached, P < 0.001). The addition of IDC-P in several prognostic nomograms could improve the predictive accuracy of these tools.

Materials and methods:   Patients with biochemical relapse after non-surgical primary treatment for localised prostate cancer were selected after a negative screen for metastatic disease. Template mapping biopsies combined with multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging were used to identify the location of the tumour and the focal clinical target volume. The planning aim dose prescription was 19 Gy. Outcome measures were biochemical relapse-free survival and toxicity using International Prostate Symptom Score and Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (version 4.0) scores.  Results:   Between March 2013 and December 2018, 50 patients underwent salvage HDR brachytherapy. The median follow-up was 21 months (range 1-53). Biochemical progression-free survival at 2 and 3 years was 63% and 46%, respectively. On multivariate analysis, only prostate-specific antigen nadir ≤0.5 ng/ml post-salvage (P = 0.03, hazard ratio 0.04) was associated with biochemical progression-free survival. Relapse was associated with distant metastases in 11/13 patients in whom this was investigated. Late grade 3 genitourinary toxicities were gross haematuria (three patients), severe lower urinary tract symptoms (two patients), erectile dysfunction (one patient) and urethral stricture requiring surgery (four patients). No acute and late grade 4 or 5 genitourinary and no grade 3 or higher gastrointestinal toxicities were recorded.  Conclusions:   Focal salvage HDR monotherapy achieves biochemical control in 46% of patients at 3 years with acceptable toxicity rates in selected patients. Biochemical relapse was related to a post-salvage prostate-specific antigen nadir of ≥0.5 ng/ml.

Subjects and method:   Men covered by the national health Insurance general scheme (77% of the French population) treated for PCa (2014-2015), who died in 2015 were identified in the national health data system, including reimbursed hospital and outpatient care, and their causes of death.  Results:   A total of 11,193 men (mean age: 81 years, SD: 9.6) were included. Almost 58% of these men died in a short-stay hospital (SSH), 4% died in hospital-at-home, 9% died in Rehab, 9% died in skilled nursing homes and 21% died at home. During the last year of life, almost all men were hospitalised at least once in SSH and 47% received hospital palliative care (HPC), immediately prior to death in 8% of cases. During the last month of life, 76% of men were hospitalised at least once in SSH, 43% attended an emergency department and 14% were admitted to intensive care, 7% received a chemotherapy session, and 24% received an antineoplastic agent dispensed by a retail pharmacy. Cancer was the main cause of death for 63% of men, corresponding to PCa in 40% of cases, and cardiovascular disease was the main cause of death for 13% of men with marked variations according to age, place of death, and use of HPC. The mean cost reimbursed per man during the last year of life was €38,750 (€48,601 including HPC).  Conclusions:   In France, end-of-life management of men with PCa, regardless of the cause of death, is centered on SSH and HPC, essentially at the time of death.

Data after 2-yr follow-up are now available for analysis.  Objective:   To determine if there was a difference in the AS failure rate in a 2-yr follow-up period among men undergoing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) before initial confirmatory biopsy (CBx) compared to those who did not.  Design, setting, and participants:   This is the 2-yr post-CBx follow-up for the ASIST trial, a prospective, randomized, multicenter, open-label study for men with Gleason grade group (GG) 1 cancer eligible for AS. Patients were randomized to CBx with 12-core systematic sampling or MRI with systematic and targeted sampling.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Patients with GG ≤ 1 on CBx were followed for 2 yr and had MRI and biopsy at that time point. Patients failed AS if they were no longer under AS because of grade progression, clinical progression, subject choice, clinical judgment, treatment, or lost to follow-up. Clinically significant cancer (CSC) was defined as GG ≥ 2.  Results and limitations:   In total, 259 men underwent CBx, 132 in the non-MRI and 127 in the MRI arm. After biopsy, 101 men in the non-MRI arm (76%) and 98 in the MRI arm (77%) continued AS. There were fewer men with AS failures in the MRI (19/98, 19%) compared to the non-MRI group (35/101, 35%; p = 0.017). At 2-yr biopsy there were fewer men with CSC in the MRI arm (9.9%, 8/81) than in the non-MRI arm (23%, 17/75; p = 0.048). Significant differences in AS failure rates were detected across the three centers in the MRI arm only (4.2% [2/48] vs 17% [4/24] vs 27% [7/26]; p = 0.019).  Conclusions:   Baseline MRI before CBx during AS results in 50% fewer AS failures and less grade progression over 2 yr. The center where MRI and targeted biopsy is performed may influence AS failure rates.  Patient summary:   The ASIST trial randomized 273 men on active surveillance with low-grade prostate cancer diagnosed within the last year to systematic biopsy or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with systematic and targeted biopsy. The initial report showed little benefit from targeted biopsy. However, after 2 yr of follow-up we found that baseline MRI before confirmatory biopsy resulted in 50% fewer failures of surveillance and less progression to higher-grade cancer. This confirms the value of MRI in men on surveillance.

Among its side effects, central nervous system disorders are relatively rare, and the information about bicalutamide-associated hallucinations is limited.  Case report:   We report an uncommon case of a patient with metastatic prostate cancer, who had hallucinations due to the use of bicalutamide.  Management and outcome:   The patient accepted to receive only hormonal therapy (bicalutamide and leuprolide acetate). But he developed hallucinations due to bicalutamide use. His hallucinations disappeared after discontinuation of bicalutamide. A good response was obtained with the use of luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonist monotherapy.  Discussion:   The pathophysiology of bicalutamide-induced hallucinations is unclear. We hypothesize that antiandrogens can indirectly cause hallucinations through changes in plasma testosterone and cerebral reelin expression. Additionally, luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonist monotherapy is a good option in metastatic prostate cancer patients who have intolerable side effects due to the use of antiandrogens.""","""['Gorkem Turkkan', 'Caner Dogan', 'Burak Tek']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""J Oncol Pharm Pract""","""['Hot flashes during androgen deprivation therapy with luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonist combined with steroidal or nonsteroidal antiandrogen for prostate cancer.', 'Atypical onset of bicalutamide-induced liver injury.', 'Bicalutamide monotherapy versus leuprolide monotherapy for prostate cancer: effects on bone mineral density and body composition.', 'Bicalutamide (Casodex) in the treatment of prostate cancer: history of clinical development.', 'Drug-induced photosensitivity to bicalutamide - case report and review of the literature.']"""

Materials and methods:   Within the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results databases, 311 pN2-3 M0 squamous cell carcinoma of the penis patients treated with inguinal lymph node dissection were identified. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses focused on CHT rates, whereas cumulative incidence plots and multivariable competing risks regression analyses tested for CSM and OCM rates.  Results:   CHT was administered to 140 (45%) patients and rates increased from 37.5 to 62.2% (2004-2015; P = 0.02). Specifically, annual CHT rates increased over time in patients younger or equal to 65 years and in patients older than 65 years (44.4-84.6% versus 28.6-50%, respectively), but this trend was not statistically significant (P = 0.1 and P = 0.2, respectively). The median follow-up was 13 months for both CHT (interquartile range 8.0-32.2) and no-CHT subgroups (interquartile range 5.0-40.0). In multivariable logistic regression analyses, more contemporary year of diagnosis interval (odds ratio 2.08, P < 0.01) and age older than 75 years (odds ratio 0.14, P < 0.001) were independent predictors of CHT use. In multivariable competing risks regression analyses, CHT use did not affect CSM (hazard ratio 1.02; P = 0.7) or OCM (hazard ratio 1.56; P = 0.8).

The objectives of this study were to address the relationship between ages at menarche and at menopause with mortality among postmenopausal women.  Study design:   The study included 75,359 U.S. postmenopausal women aged 50-78 years from the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian (PLCO) cohort. Information on ages at menarche and menopause was self-reported and collected at baseline, by questionnaire.  Main outcome measures:   All-cause, cardiovascular and cancer mortality.  Results:   After a median follow-up of 13 years, we identified 7826 deaths among 75,359 women in the PLCO cohort. Compared with women with an age at menarche of 12-13 years and an age at menopause of 45-54 years, the adjusted hazard ratios (95% confidence interval) for all-cause mortality for women with early menarche (≤11 years) and menopause (≤44 years) and those with late menarche (≥14 years) and menopause (≥55 years) were 1.20 (1.09, 1.32) and 0.82 (0.71, 0.96), respectively. This association remained significant in a sensitivity analysis that excluded women who did not undergo natural menopause. The indexes for the additive effect of the combined association showed no excess risk due to an interaction.

Positron emission tomography (PET) radiotracers targeting prostate-specific membrane antigen, such as 18F-DCFPyL have shown promise in restaging men with recurrent disease postprostatectomy but are less well characterized in the setting of radio-recurrent disease.  Methods and materials:   A prospective, multi-institutional study was conducted to evaluate the effect of 18F-DCFPyL PET/computed tomography (CT) when added to diagnostic imaging (DI; CT abdomen and pelvis, bone scan, multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging pelvis) for men with radio-recurrent prostate cancer. All men were imaged with DI and subsequently underwent 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT with local and central reads. Tie break reads were performed as required. Management questionnaires were completed after DI and again after 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT. Discordance in patterns of disease detected with 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT versus DI and changes in management were characterized.  Results:   Seventy-nine men completed the study. Most men had T1 disease (62%) and Gleason score <7 (95%). Median prostate-specific antigen at diagnosis was 7.4 ng/mL and at relapse was 4.8 ng/mL.

The objective of the current study was to perform a pan-cancer clinical and epigenetic molecular analysis of outcomes in African American (AA) and European American (EA) patients.  Methods:   Cross-platform analyses using cancer databases (the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program database and the National Cancer Data Base) and a molecular database (The Cancer Genome Ancestry Atlas) were performed to evaluate clinical and epigenetic molecular differences between AA and EA patients based on genetic ancestry.  Results:   In the primary pan-cancer survival analysis using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database (2,045,839 patients; 87.5% EA and 12.5% AA), AA patients had higher mortality rates for 28 of 42 cancer types analyzed (hazard ratio, >1.0). AAs continued to have higher mortality in 13 cancer types after adjustment for socioeconomic variables using the National Cancer Database (5,150,023 patients; 11.6% AA and 88.4% EA). Then, molecular features of 5,283 tumors were analyzed in patients who had genetic ancestry data available (87.2% EA and 12.8% AA). Genes were identified with altered DNA methylation along with increased microRNA expression levels unique to AA patients that are associated with cancer drug resistance. Increased miRNAs (miR-15a, miR-17, miR-130-3p, miR-181a) were noted in common among AAs with breast, kidney, thyroid, or prostate carcinomas.  Conclusions:   The current results identified epigenetic features in AA patients who have cancer that may contribute to higher mortality rates compared with EA patients who have cancer.

However, there is lack of research concerning safety and feasibility of HIIT in cancer survivors. Therefore, two different HIIT protocols were investigated in terms of safety, feasibility, and acute exercise responses.  Methods:   Forty cancer survivors (20 breast and 20 prostate cancer survivors, 62.9 ± 9.2 yr, BMI 27.4 ± 3.9 kg·m, 6 to 52 wk after the end of primary therapy) completed a maximal cardiopulmonary exercise test and two HIIT protocols on a cycle ergometer: 10 × 1 min at peak power output (10 × 1) and 4 × 4 min at 85%-95% peak HR (4 × 4). Safety (adverse events), acute physiological responses (HR, blood lactate concentration) and acute psychological responses (RPE, enjoyment) were recorded.  Results:   No major but three minor adverse events occurred. Ninety-five percent of participants were able to complete each HIIT protocol. Estimated energy expenditure (159 ± 15 vs 223 ± 45 kcal, P < 0.001), HR (128 ± 20 vs 139 ± 18 bpm; P < 0.001), blood lactate concentration (5.4 ± 1.0 vs 5.9 ± 1.9 mmol·L; P = 0.035), and RPE legs/breathing (13.8 ± 2.0/13.1 ± 2.0 vs 14.6 ± 2.1/14.3 ± 2.0; P = 0.038/0.003) were significantly higher in the 4 × 4. Enjoyment did not differ between protocols (P = 0.301).  Conclusions:   The two HIIT protocols as single sessions appear safe and in the vast majority of breast and prostate cancer survivors after the end of primary therapy also feasible and enjoyable. The 4 × 4 elicited higher energy expenditure and higher cardio-circulatory and metabolic strain and might therefore be preferred if a high training stimulus is intended.""","""['Kathrin Schlüter', 'Justine Schneider', 'Tanja Sprave', 'Joachim Wiskemann', 'Friederike Rosenberger']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Med Sci Sports Exerc""","""['Psychological and Behavioral Responses to Interval and Continuous Exercise.', 'Exercise intensity prescription in cancer survivors: ventilatory and lactate thresholds are useful submaximal alternatives to VO2peak.', 'Dissimilar Physiological and Perceptual Responses Between Sprint Interval Training and High-Intensity Interval Training.', ""Affective and enjoyment responses to 12 weeks of high intensity interval training and moderate continuous training in adults with Crohn's disease."", 'Virtual-reality exergaming improves performance during high-intensity interval training.', 'The impact of high intensity interval training in a diverse group of cancer survivors: CAPABLE, a pilot study.', 'Skeletal Muscle-Adipose Tissue-Tumor Axis: Molecular Mechanisms Linking Exercise Training in Prostate Cancer.']"""

Here we have investigated the signaling pathways that support migration and invasion of prostate cancer cells, focusing on the role of the NFATC1 transcription factor and its post-translational modifications. We have previously identified NFATC1 as a substrate for the PIM1 kinase and shown that PIM1-dependent phosphorylation increases NFATC1 activity without affecting its subcellular localization. Both PIM kinases and NFATC1 have been reported to promote cancer cell migration, invasion and angiogenesis, but it has remained unclear whether the effects of NFATC1 are phosphorylation-dependent and which downstream targets are involved.  Methods:   We used mass spectrometry to identify PIM1 phosphorylation target sites in NFATC1, and analysed their functional roles in three prostate cancer cell lines by comparing phosphodeficient mutants to wild-type NFATC1. We used luciferase assays to determine effects of phosphorylation on NFAT-dependent transcriptional activity, and migration and invasion assays to evaluate effects on cell motility. We also performed a microarray analysis to identify novel PIM1/NFATC1 targets, and validated one of them with both cellular expression analyses and in silico in clinical prostate cancer data sets.  Results:   Here we have identified ten PIM1 target sites in NFATC1 and found that prevention of their phosphorylation significantly decreases the transcriptional activity as well as the pro-migratory and pro-invasive effects of NFATC1 in prostate cancer cells. We observed that also PIM2 and PIM3 can phosphorylate NFATC1, and identified several novel putative PIM1/NFATC1 target genes. These include the ITGA5 integrin, which is differentially expressed in the presence of wild-type versus phosphorylation-deficient NFATC1, and which is coexpressed with PIM1 and NFATC1 in clinical prostate cancer specimens.  Conclusions:   Based on our data, phosphorylation of PIM1 target sites stimulates NFATC1 activity and enhances its ability to promote prostate cancer cell migration and invasion. Therefore, inhibition of the interplay between PIM kinases and NFATC1 may have therapeutic implications for patients with metastatic forms of cancer.""","""['Sini K Eerola', 'Niina M Santio', 'Sanni Rinne', 'Petri Kouvonen', 'Garry L Corthals', 'Mauro Scaravilli', 'Giovanni Scala', 'Angela Serra', 'Dario Greco', 'Pekka Ruusuvuori', 'Leena Latonen', 'Eeva-Marja Rainio', 'Tapio Visakorpi', 'Päivi J Koskinen']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Cell Commun Signal""","""['PIM1 accelerates prostate cancer cell motility by phosphorylating actin capping proteins.', 'Identification of PIM1 substrates reveals a role for NDRG1 phosphorylation in prostate cancer cellular migration and invasion.', 'Phosphorylation of the androgen receptor by PIM1 in hormone refractory prostate cancer.', 'PIM1 kinase as a target in prostate cancer: roles in tumorigenesis, castration resistance, and docetaxel resistance.', 'PIM kinases: From survival factors to regulators of cell motility.', 'The role of NPY2R/NFATc1/DYRK1A regulatory axis in sebaceous glands for sebum synthesis.', 'Inhibition of PIM Kinases Promotes Neuroblastoma Cell Differentiation to a Neuronal Phenotype.', 'Targeting Pim kinases in hematological cancers: molecular and clinical review.', 'The Role of PIM Kinases in Pediatric Solid Tumors.', 'A systematic review on active sites and functions of PIM-1 protein.']"""

Current imaging guidelines recommend various imaging platforms such as computed tomography (CT), Technetium 99 m (99mTc) bone scan and 18F-choline and recently 68Ga-PSMA positron emission tomography (PET) for the evaluation of the extent of disease. Such approach requires multiple hospital attendances and can be time and resource intensive. Recently, whole-body magnetic resonance imaging (WB-MRI) has been used in a single visit scanning session for several malignancies, including prostate cancer, with promising results, providing similar accuracy compared to the combined conventional imaging techniques. The LOCATE trial aims to investigate the application of WB-MRI for re-staging of patients with biochemical relapse (BCR) following external beam radiotherapy and brachytherapy in patients with prostate cancer.  Methods/design:   The LOCATE trial is a prospective cohort, multi-centre, non-randomised, diagnostic accuracy study comparing WB-MRI and conventional imaging. Eligible patients will undergo WB-MRI in addition to conventional imaging investigations at the time of BCR and will be asked to attend a second WB-MRI exam, 12-months following the initial scan. WB-MRI results will be compared to an enhanced reference standard comprising all the initial, follow-up imaging and non-imaging investigations. The diagnostic performance (sensitivity and specificity analysis) of WB-MRI for re-staging of BCR will be investigated against the enhanced reference standard on a per-patient basis. An economic analysis of WB-MRI compared to conventional imaging pathways will be performed to inform the cost-effectiveness of the WB-MRI imaging pathway. Additionally, an exploratory sub-study will be performed on blood samples and exosome-derived human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER) dimer measurements will be taken to investigate its significance in this cohort.  Discussion:   The LOCATE trial will compare WB-MRI versus the conventional imaging pathway including its cost-effectiveness, therefore informing the most accurate and efficient imaging pathway.

Unfortunately, patients can develop resistance to AR-targeted therapies and progress to lethal disease, underscoring the importance of understanding the molecular mechanisms that underlie treatment resistance. Inflammation is implicated in PCa initiation and progression and we have previously reported that the inflammatory cytokine, interleukin-1 (IL-1), represses AR messenger RNA (mRNA) levels and activity in AR-positive (AR+ ) PCa cell lines concomitant with the upregulation of prosurvival biomolecules. Thus, we contend that IL-1 can select for AR-independent, treatment-resistant PCa cells.  Methods:   To begin to explore how IL-1 signaling leads to the repression of AR mRNA levels, we performed comprehensive pathway analysis on our RNA sequencing data from IL-1-treated LNCaP PCa cells. Our pathway analysis predicted nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) p65 subunit (RELA), a canonical IL-1 signal transducer, to be significantly active and potentially regulate many genes, including AR. We used small interfering RNA (siRNA) to silence the NF-κB family of transcription factor subunits, RELA, RELB, c-REL, NFKB1, or NFKB2, in IL-1-treated LNCaP, C4-2, and C4-2B PCa cell lines. C4-2 and C4-2B cell lines are castration-resistant LNCaP sublines and represent progression toward metastatic PCa disease, and we have previously shown that IL-1 represses AR mRNA levels in C4-2 and C4-2B cells.  Results:   siRNA revealed that RELA alone is sufficient to mediate IL-1 repression of AR mRNA and AR activity. Intriguingly, while LNCaP cells are more sensitive to IL-1-mediated repression of AR than C4-2 and C4-2B cells, RELA siRNA led to a more striking derepression of AR mRNA levels and AR activity in C4-2 and C4-2B cells than in LNCaP cells.  Conclusions:   These data indicate that there are RELA-independent mechanisms that regulate IL-1-mediated AR repression in LNCaP cells and suggest that the switch to RELA-dependent IL-1 repression of AR in C4-2 and C4-2B cells reflects changes in epigenetic and transcriptional programs that evolve during PCa disease progression.""","""['Shayna E Thomas-Jardin', 'Haley Dahl', 'Mohammed S Kanchwala', 'Freedom Ha', 'Joan Jacob', 'Reshma Soundharrajan', 'Monica Bautista', 'Afshan F Nawas', 'Dexter Robichaux', 'Ragini Mistry', 'Vanessa Anunobi', 'Chao Xing', 'Nikki A Delk']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Interplay of nuclear factor-kappaB and B-myb in the negative regulation of androgen receptor expression by tumor necrosis factor alpha.', 'Melatonin Inhibits Androgen Receptor Splice Variant-7 (AR-V7)-Induced Nuclear Factor-Kappa B (NF-κB) Activation and NF-κB Activator-Induced AR-V7 Expression in Prostate Cancer Cells: Potential Implications for the Use of Melatonin in Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer (CRPC) Therapy.', 'Chronic IL-1 exposure drives LNCaP cells to evolve androgen and AR independence.', 'NF-κB signaling promotes castration-resistant prostate cancer initiation and progression.', 'Androgen receptor-dependent and -independent mechanisms driving prostate cancer progression: Opportunities for therapeutic targeting from multiple angles.', 'The In Vitro Pro-inflammatory Functions of the SP/NK1R System in Prostate Cancer: a Focus on Nuclear Factor-Kappa B (NF-κB) and Its Pro-inflammatory Target Genes.', 'Interleukin-1 and Nuclear Factor Kappa B Signaling Promote Breast Cancer Progression and Treatment Resistance.', 'Gene network screening of bladder cancer via modular analysis.', 'Chronic IL-1 Exposed AR+ PCa Cell Lines Show Conserved Loss of IL-1 Sensitivity and Evolve Both Conserved and Unique Differential Gene Expression Profiles.', 'Response to Androgens and Androgen Receptor Antagonists in the Presence of Cytokines in Prostate Cancer.']"""

Recently small molecular inhibitors have been developed to target USP7. However, the anticancer mechanism of USP7 inhibitors is still elusive.  Methods:   Cell viability or clonogenicity was tested by violet crystal assay. Cell apoptosis or cell cycle was analyzed by flow cytometry, and chromosome misalignment was observed by a fluorescent microscopy. The protein interaction of PLK1 and USP7 was detected by tandem affinity purification and high throughput proteomics, and further confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation, GST pull-down and protein co-localization. The correlation between USP7 level of tumor tissues and taxane-resistance was evaluated.  Results:   Pharmacological USP7 inhibition by P5091 retarded cell proliferation and induced cell apoptosis. Further studies showed that P5091 induced cell cycle arrest at G2/M phase, and particularly induced chromosome misalignment, indicating the key roles of USP7 in mitosis. USP7 protein was detected in the PLK1-interacted protein complex. USP7 interacts with PLK1 protein through its PBD domain by catalytic activity. USP7 as a deubiquitinase sustained PLK1 protein stability via the C223 site, and inversely, USP7 inhibition by P5091 promoted the protein degradation of PLK1 through the ubiquitination-proteasome pathway. By overexpressing PLK1, USP7 that had been depleted by RNAi ceased to induce chromosome misalignment in mitosis and again supported cell proliferation and cell survival. Both USP7 and PLK1 were overexpressed in taxane-resistant cancer cells, and negatively correlated with the MP scores in tumor tissues. Either USP7 or PLK1 knockdown by RNAi significantly sensitized taxane-resistant cells to taxane cell killing.  Conclusion:   This is the first report that PLK1 is a novel substrate of USP7 deubiquitinase, and that USP7 sustained the protein stability of PLK1. USP7 inhibition induces cell apoptosis and cell cycle G2/M arrest, and overcomes taxane resistance by inducing the protein degradation of PLK1, resulting in chromosome misalignment in mitosis.""","""['Yuchong Peng', 'Youhong Liu', 'Yingxue Gao', 'Bowen Yuan', 'Xuli Qi', 'Yuxin Fu', 'Qianling Zhu', 'Tuoyu Cao', 'Songwei Zhang', 'Linglong Yin', 'Xiong Li']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""J Exp Clin Cancer Res""","""['Combination of Inhibitors of USP7 and PLK1 has a Strong Synergism against Paclitaxel Resistance.', 'USP7 and Daxx regulate mitosis progression and taxane sensitivity by affecting stability of Aurora-A kinase.', 'MiR-509-3-5p causes aberrant mitosis and anti-proliferative effect by suppression of PLK1 in human lung cancer A549 cells.', 'Targeting ubiquitin specific protease 7 in cancer: A deubiquitinase with great prospects.', 'Polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1) signaling in cancer and beyond.', 'Ubiquitin specific protease 7 maintains pluripotency of mouse embryonic stem cells through stabilization of β-catenin.', 'Regulation of intestinal stem cell activity by a mitotic cell cycle regulator Polo in Drosophila.', 'USP7 controls NGN3 stability and pancreatic endocrine lineage development.', 'Ubiquitin specific peptidases and prostate cancer.', 'Protein degradation: expanding the toolbox to restrain cancer drug resistance.']"""

We hypothesized that this training, which commenced pre-operatively, would improve PFM function and reduce PPI, when compared to a control group.  Methods:   This randomized trial allocated 97 men (63 ± 7y, BMI = 25.4, Gleason 7) undergoing radical prostatectomy (RP) to either a control group (n = 47) performing low-volume rehabilitation, or an intervention group (n = 50). Both interventions commenced 5 weeks prior to surgery and continued for 12 weeks post-RP. Participants were assessed pre-operatively and at 2, 6 and 12 weeks post-RP using 24 h pad weights, International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS), Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite for Clinical Practice (EPIC-CP) and real time ultrasound (RTUS) measurements of PFM function.  Results:   Following RP, participants in the control group demonstrated a slower return to continence and experienced significantly more leakage (p < 0.05), measured by 24 h pad weight, compared to the intervention group, suggesting an impact of the prehabilitation protocol. PFM function measures were enhanced following RP in the intervention group.

The v-etserythroblastosis virus E26 oncogene homologue (ERG) is a proto-oncogene of the erythroblast transformation specific transcription factor family. TMPRSS2-ERG fusion is the most common molecular alteration present in about 50% of prostatic adenocarcinomas. Androgen receptor (AR) plays a key role in prostate development and is involved in the progression of prostate cancer. Objective To evaluate the significance of combined ERG and AR expression in cases of prostatic adenocarcinoma. Method The study was conducted at Dr. Ram Manohar Lohia Institute of Medical Sciences, Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh, India. Formalin fixed-paraffin embedded archival prostatic tissue specimens were obtained. A total of 10 cases of prostatic adenocarcinoma were included in the study. Immunohistochemistry for Androgen receptor was done by the standard protocol. Multiplex immunohistochemical staining was done for ERG+CK5 using a primary antibody cocktail of mouse and rabbit antibodies. Result Specific AR immunostaining was exclusively nuclear and was present in all 10 cases in varying intensity. Specific ERG immunostaining was nuclear and was present in seven cases (70%) and absent in three cases (30%). The three cases that were negative for ERG had a Gleason score of ≤ 6 and the AR staining was strong and present in about 90% of the cells. Gleason score was directly related to the ERG staining while AR staining was inversely related to the ERG staining. Conclusion The prognostic value of combined ERG and AR over-expression, its associated genes should be further investigated as potential therapeutic targets in prostate cancer progression. Preliminary data is being presented. Larger prospective studies with survival analysis are essential for prognostic significance.""","""['I Husain', 'P Sagar', 'S Shukla', 'S Babu', 'A Singhai', 'S N Sankhwar', 'N Husain']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Kathmandu Univ Med J (KUMJ)""","""['Immunohistochemical expression of Ets-related gene-transcriptional factor in adenocarcinoma prostate and its correlation with Gleason score.', 'Role of androgen receptor in prostatic neoplasia versus hyperplasia.', 'Micro-RNA-204 Participates in TMPRSS2/ERG Regulation and Androgen Receptor Reprogramming in Prostate Cancer.', 'TMPRSS2:ERG Gene Fusions in Prostate Cancer of West African Men and a Meta-Analysis of Racial Differences.', 'Emerging biological observations in prostate cancer.']"""

DUS4L-BCAP29, a chimeric fusion RNA, has been reported to be a cancer-related fusion in prostate and gastric cancers. This chimeric RNA is believed to play a tumorigenic role. Here, we showed that the DUS4L-BCAP29 fusion transcript exists in a variety of normal tissues. It is also present in noncancerous epithelial and fibroblast cell lines. Quantitatively, the fusion transcript has a similar expression level in noncancerous gastric and prostate cell lines and tissues to its expression in cancerous cell lines and tissues. Previously, a loss-of-function approach was used to report a probable functionality for this fusion. However, this approach is not sufficient to prove such functionality. Alternatively, a gain-of-function approach showed that overexpression of DUS4L-BCAP29 promotes cell growth and motility, even in noncancerous cell lines. Finally, we provide further evidence that the fusion transcript is a product of cis-splicing between adjacent genes. In summary, we believe that in contrast to traditional gene fusions, DUS4L-BCAP29 cannot be used as a cancer biomarker.

PreView, an interactive, individually tailored Video Doctor Plus Provider Alert Intervention, adresses all cancers for which average risk 50-70-year-old individuals are due for screening or screening discussion.  Methods:   We conducted a randomized controlled trial in 6 clinical sites. Participants were randomized to PreView or a video about healthy lifestyle. Intervention group participants completed PreView before their appointment and their clinicians received a ""Provider Alert."" Primary outcomes were receipt of mammography, Pap tests (with or without HPV testing), CRC screening (FIT in last year or colonoscopy in last 10 years), and PSA screening discussion. Additional outcomes included breast, cervical, and CRC screening discussion.  Results:   A total of 508 individuals participated, 257 in the control group and 251 in the intervention group. Screening rates were relatively high at baseline. Compared with baseline screening rates, there was no significant increase in mammography or Pap smear screening, and a nonsignificant increase (18% vs 12%) in CRC screening. Intervention participants reported a higher rate of PSA discussion than did control participants (58% vs 36%: P < 0.01). Similar increases were seen in discussions about mammography, cervical cancer, and CRC screening.  Conclusion:   In clinics with relatively high overall screening rates at baseline, PreView did not result in significant increases in breast, cervical, or CRC screening. PreView led to an increase in PSA screening discussion. Clinician-patient discussion of all cancer screenings significantly increased, suggesting that interventions like PreView may be most useful when discussion of the pros and cons of screening is recommended and/or with patients reluctant to undergo screening.

Introduction:   The time point of removing the indwelling catheter after RARP mainly depends on institute's/surgeon's preferences. Removal should be late enough to avoid urinary leakage and complications such as acute urinary retention (AUR) but early enough to avoid unnecessary catheter indwelling.  Materials and methods:   A consecutive single-institutional series of patients underwent RARP between July 2015 and August 2017 and were entered in a prospectively maintained data base. Between July 2015 and December 2016 a cystogram was performed on 7th postoperative day (group A), thereafter the cystogram was performed on 4th postoperative day (group B). Incidence of acute urinary retention (AUR), urinary tract infections (UTI) and adverse events between the two cohorts was compared.  Results:   425 patients were analyzed (group A: n = 231; group B: n = 194). Both cohorts were comparable regarding demographic and oncological parameters. Watertight anastomosis was present in 84.8% in group A and in 82.5% in group B, respectively. AUR within 4 weeks after RARP occurred in 2.2% (n = 3) in A and 9.4% (n = 15) in B (p = 0.001). AUR within 72 h after catheter removal occurred in group A: 1% (n = 2) and in group B: 6.3% (n = 10) (p = 0.005). Symptomatic urinary tract infections occurred in 8.2% (n = 16) in group A and in 6.9% (n = 11) in group B. There were no differences in the rate of secondary anastomosis dehiscence. Age, BMI, prostate size, surgeon, or intraoperative bladder neck reconstruction were not correlated to the occurrence of AUR or UTI.  Conclusions:   The removal of indwelling catheter on day 4 after a RARP with a running barbed suture shows similar anastomosis leakage rates as on the 7th postoperative day. However, AUR rates are higher for early removal. Patients scheduled for early removal should be carefully informed about the increased risk for AUR.

However, there is morbidity associated with I-131 therapy, which can result in both acute and chronic complications. Currently, there are no approved radioprotectors that can be used in conjunction with I-131 to reduce complications in thyroid cancer therapy. It is well known that the damaging effects of ionizing radiation are mediated, in part, by the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). A potent scavenger of ROS, Mn(III)meso-tetrakis(N-n-butoxyethylpyridinium-2-yl)porphyrin (MnTnBuOE-2-PyP), has radioprotective and anti-tumor effects in various cancer models including head and neck, prostate, and brain tumors exposed to external beam radiation therapy. Female C57BL/6 mice were administered I-131 orally at doses of 0.0085-0.01 mCi/g (3.145 × 105 to 3.7 × 105 Bq) of body weight with or without MnTnBuOE-2-PyP. We measured acute external inflammation, blood cell counts, and collected thyroid tissue and salivary glands for histological examination. We found oral administration of I-131 caused an acute decrease in platelets and white blood cells, caused facial swelling, and loss of thyroid and salivary tissues. However, when MnTnBuOE-2-PyP was given during and after I-131 administration, blood cell counts remained in the normal range, less facial inflammation was observed, and the salivary glands were protected from radiation-induced killing. These data indicate that MnTnBuOE-2-PyP may be a potent radioprotector of salivary glands in thyroid cancer patients receiving I-131 therapy.""","""['Anery Patel', 'Elizabeth A Kosmacek', 'Kurt W Fisher', 'Whitney Goldner', 'Rebecca E Oberley-Deegan']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Radiat Environ Biophys""","""['Neurobehavioral radiation mitigation to standard brain cancer therapy regimens by Mn(III) n-butoxyethylpyridylporphyrin-based redox modifier.', 'MnTnBuOE-2-PyP protects normal colorectal fibroblasts from radiation damage and simultaneously enhances radio/chemotherapeutic killing of colorectal cancer cells.', 'Radioprotection of the brain white matter by Mn(III) n-Butoxyethylpyridylporphyrin-based superoxide dismutase mimic MnTnBuOE-2-PyP5+.', 'Amifostine for salivary glands in high-dose radioactive iodine treated differentiated thyroid cancer.', 'Does amifostine have radioprotective effects on salivary glands in high-dose radioactive iodine-treated differentiated thyroid cancer.', 'Effect and mechanism of paclitaxel loaded on magnetic Fe3O4@mSiO2-NH2-FA nanocomposites to MCF-7 cells.', 'Effectiveness and Safety of Levothyroxine Tablets Combined with Iodine-131 in the Treatment of Thyroid Cancer.', 'H2O2-Driven Anticancer Activity of Mn Porphyrins and the Underlying Molecular Pathways.']"""

Methods:   Twenty-five (25) patients with PC biochemical relapse or progression (median age = 66.0 years) were enrolled in the analysis. The median PSA value was 1.2 ng/mL (range = 0.1-237.3 ng/mL) and the median Gleason score was 7 (range = 6-10). All patients underwent dynamic PET/CT (dPET/CT) scanning (60 min) of the pelvis and lower abdomen as well as whole-body PET/CT with 18F-PSMA-1007. PET/CT assessment was based on qualitative evaluation, SUV calculation, and quantitative analysis based on a two-tissue compartment model and fractal analysis.  Results:   15/25 patients were PET-positive.

Transplant candidates and recipients with prostate cancer are often treated, even if low-risk features would ordinarily justify active surveillance.  Methods:   Using SEER-Medicare, we identified 163 676 men aged 66 years and older diagnosed with nonmetastatic prostate cancer. History of solid organ transplant was identified using diagnosis or procedure codes. A propensity score-matched cohort was identified by matching transplanted men to nontransplanted controls by age, race, region, year, T-stage, grade, comorbidity, and cancer therapy. Fine-Gray competing risk models assessed associations between transplant status and prostate cancer-specific mortality (PCSM) and overall mortality (OM).  Results:   We identified 620 men (0.4%) with transplant up to 10 years before (n = 320) or 5 years after (n = 300) prostate cancer diagnosis and matched them to 3100 men. At 10 years, OM was 55.7% and PCSM was 6.0% in the transplant cohort compared with 42.4% (P < .001) and 7.6% (P = .70) in the nontransplant cohort, respectively. Adjusted models showed no difference in PCSM for transplanted men (hazard ratio = 0.88, 95% confidence interval = 0.61 to 1.27, P = .70) or differences by prostate cancer therapy. Among 334 transplanted men with T1-2N0, well or moderately differentiated ""low-risk"" prostate cancer, PCSM was similar for treated and untreated men (hazard ratio = 0.92, 95% confidence interval = 0.47 to 1.81).  Conclusions:   Among men aged 66 years and older with prostate cancer, an organ transplant is associated with higher OM but no observable difference in PCSM.

Macrophages loaded with calcium integrin binding protein-1 (CIB1)-siRNA result in decreased tumorsphere growth and decreased mRNA expression of CIB1 and KI67 in MDA-MB-468 human breast cancer cells. Adoptive transfer of macrophages transfected with CIB1-siRNA localizes to the orthotopic MDA-MB-468 tumor. Furthermore, it is reported that macrophage activation can modulate this transfer process as well as intracellular trafficking protein Rab27a. As macrophages are heavily involved in tumor progression, understanding how to use macrophages for drug delivery can substantially benefit the treatment of tumors.""","""['Elizabeth C Wayne', 'Christian Long', 'Matthew J Haney', 'Elena V Batrakova', 'Tina M Leisner', 'Leslie V Parise', 'Alexander V Kabanov']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Adv Sci (Weinh)""","""['Evaluation of inflammatory responses due to small interfering RNA transfer using unmodified- and mannose-modified bubble lipoplexes with ultrasound exposure in primary cultured macrophages.', 'A systematic comparison of lipopolymers for siRNA delivery to multiple breast cancer cell lines: In vitro studies.', 'Imaging of cationic multifunctional liposome-mediated delivery of COX-2 siRNA.', 'Non-viral Delivery of Nucleic Acids: Insight Into Mechanisms of Overcoming Intracellular Barriers.', 'Development of siRNA delivery strategy by active control of tumor microenvironment.', 'Harnessing anti-tumor and tumor-tropism functions of macrophages via nanotechnology for tumor immunotherapy.', 'Ionizable lipid nanoparticles deliver mRNA to pancreatic β cells via macrophage-mediated gene transfer.', 'Macrophage cell membrane-based nanoparticles: a new promising biomimetic platform for targeted delivery and treatment.', 'Application of lipid-based nanoparticles in cancer immunotherapy.', 'MiRNA-SARS-CoV-2 dialogue and prospective anti-COVID-19 therapies.']"""

Using CRISPR/Cas9 knockout screens and gene essentiality or fitness as the readout, we systematically investigated the essentiality of over 10,000 FOXA1 and CTCF binding sites in breast and prostate cancer cells. We found that essential FOXA1 binding sites act as enhancers to orchestrate the expression of nearby essential genes through the binding of lineage-specific transcription factors. In contrast, CRISPR screens of the CTCF cistrome revealed 2 classes of essential binding sites. The first class of essential CTCF binding sites act like FOXA1 sites as enhancers to regulate the expression of nearby essential genes, while a second class of essential CTCF binding sites was identified at topologically associated domain (TAD) boundaries and display distinct characteristics. Using regression methods trained on our screening data and public epigenetic profiles, we developed a model to predict essential cis-elements with high accuracy. The model for FOXA1 essentiality correctly predicts noncoding variants associated with cancer risk and progression. Taken together, CRISPR screens of cis-regulatory elements can define the essential cistrome of a given factor and can inform the development of predictive models of cistrome function.""","""['Teng Fei', 'Wei Li', 'Jingyu Peng', 'Tengfei Xiao', 'Chen-Hao Chen', 'Alexander Wu', 'Jialiang Huang', 'Chongzhi Zang', 'X Shirley Liu', 'Myles Brown']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A""","""['Shining light on dark matter in the genome.', 'CRISPR-mediated deletion of prostate cancer risk-associated CTCF loop anchors identifies repressive chromatin loops.', 'Integrated analysis identifies a class of androgen-responsive genes regulated by short combinatorial long-range mechanism facilitated by CTCF.', 'CRISPR/Cas9 offers a new tool for studying the role of chromatin architecture in disease pathogenesis.', 'The advances in CRISPR technology and 3D genome.', 'The structural and functional roles of CTCF in the regulation of cell type-specific and human disease-associated super-enhancers.', 'To bind or not to bind: Cistromic reprogramming in prostate cancer.', 'FOXA1 regulates alternative splicing in prostate cancer.', 'Multiplexed functional genomic assays to decipher the noncoding genome.', 'CRISPR base editing of cis-regulatory elements enables the perturbation of neurodegeneration-linked genes.', 'A Distinct Chromatin State Drives Therapeutic Resistance in Invasive Lobular Breast Cancer.']"""

Abi is a selective steroidal inhibitor that blocks the biosynthesis of androgens. It undergoes extensive biotransformation by steroid pathways, leading to the formation of pharmacologically active Δ4-Abi (D4A) and 5α-Abi. This study aimed to characterize the glucuronidation pathway of Abi and its two active metabolites. We show that Abi, its metabolites, and another steroidal inhibitor galeterone (Gal) undergo secondary metabolism to form glucuronides (G) in human liver microsomes with minor formation by intestine and kidney microsomal preparations. The potential clinical relevance of this pathway is supported by the detection by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry of Abi-G, D4A-G, and 5α-Abi-G in patients under AA therapy. A screening of UGT enzymes reveals that UGT1A4 is the main enzyme involved. This is supported by inhibition experiments using a selective UGT1A4 inhibitor hecogenin. A number of common and rare nonsynonymous variants significantly abrogate the UGT1A4-mediated formation of Abi-G, D4A-G, and 5α-Abi-G in vitro. We also identify Gal, Abi, and its metabolites as highly potent inhibitors of steroid inactivation by the UGT pathway with submicromolar inhibitor constant values. They reduce the glucuronidation of both the adrenal precursors and potent androgens in human liver, prostate cancer cells, and by recombinant UGTs involved in their inactivation. In conclusion, tested CYP17A1 inhibitors are metabolized through UGT1A4, and germline variations affecting this metabolic pathway may also influence drug metabolism. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: The antiandrogen abiraterone (Abi) is a selective steroidal inhibitor of the cytochrome P450 17α-hydroxy/17,20-lyase, an enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of androgens. Abi is metabolized to pharmacologically active metabolites by steroidogenic enzymes. We demonstrate that Abi and its metabolites are glucuronidated in the liver and that their glucuronide derivatives are detected at variable levels in circulation of treated prostate cancer patients. UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT)1A4 is the primary enzyme involved, and nonsynonymous germline variations affect this metabolic pathway in vitro, suggesting a potential influence of drug metabolism and action in patients. Their inhibitory effect on drug and steroid glucuronidation raises the possibility that these pharmacological compounds might affect the UGT-associated drug-metabolizing system and pre-receptor control of androgen metabolism in patients.""","""['Joanie Vaillancourt', 'Véronique Turcotte', 'Patrick Caron', 'Lyne Villeneuve', 'Louis Lacombe', 'Frédéric Pouliot', 'Éric Lévesque', 'Chantal Guillemette']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Drug Metab Dispos""","""['An LC-MS/MS method for quantification of abiraterone, its active metabolites D(4)-abiraterone (D4A) and 5α-abiraterone, and their inactive glucuronide derivatives.', ""Metabolism of 1'- and 4-hydroxymidazolam by glucuronide conjugation is largely mediated by UDP-glucuronosyltransferases 1A4, 2B4, and 2B7."", 'Identification of the UDP-glucuronosyltransferase isozyme involved in senecionine glucuronidation in human liver microsomes.', 'Species differences in drug glucuronidation: Humanized UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 1 mice and their application for predicting drug glucuronidation and drug-induced toxicity in humans.', 'Characterization and regulation of UDP-glucuronosyltransferases in steroid target tissues.', 'Sources of Interindividual Variability.', 'Gene polymorphism-related differences in the outcomes of abiraterone for prostate cancer: a systematic overview.']"""

The net benefit of the nomogram to predict LNI was assessed by decision curve analysis and a cut-off was proposed.  Results:   In total, 14% of the patients in our cohort had pN1 disease. Applying logistic regression analysis, the following covariates were chosen to develop the nomogram: initial PSA, clinical T stage, biopsy Gleason sum, and proportion of positive biopsy cores. The nomogram showed a median discriminative accuracy of 73% and excellent calibration. The net benefit of the model ranged between 7% and 51% predicted risk of LNI.

We aimed to determine the best sequence in which to use both drugs, as well as their second-line efficacy.  Methods:   In this multicentre, randomised, open-label, phase 2, crossover trial done in six cancer centres in British Columbia, Canada, we recruited patients aged 18 years or older with newly-diagnosed metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer without neuroendocrine differentiation and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 2 or less. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) using a computer-generated random number table to receive either abiraterone acetate 1000 mg orally once daily plus prednisone 5 mg orally twice daily until PSA progression followed by crossover to enzalutamide 160 mg orally once daily (group A), or the opposite sequence (group B). Treatment was not masked to investigators or participants. Primary endpoints were time to second PSA progression and PSA response (≥30% decline from baseline) on second-line therapy, analysed by intention-to-treat in all randomly assigned patients and in patients who crossed over, respectively. The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02125357.  Findings:   Between Oct 21, 2014, and Dec 13, 2016, 202 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to either group A (n=101) or group B (n=101). At the time of data cutoff, 73 (72%) patients in group A and 75 (74%) patients in group B had crossed over. Time to second PSA progression was longer in group A than in group B (median 19·3 months [95% CI 16·0-30·5] vs 15·2 months [95% CI 11·9-19·8] months; hazard ratio 0·66, 95% CI 0·45-0·97, p=0·036), at a median follow-up of 22·8 months (IQR 10·3-33·4). PSA responses to second-line therapy were seen in 26 (36%) of 73 patients for enzalutamide and three (4%) of 75 for abiraterone (χ2 p<0·0001). The most common grade 3-4 adverse events throughout the trial were hypertension (27 [27%] of 101 patients in group A vs 18 [18%] of 101 patients in group B) and fatigue (six [10%] vs four [4%]). Serious adverse events were reported in 15 (15%) of 101 patients in group A and 20 (20%) of 101 patients in group B. There were no treatment-related deaths.  Interpretation:   Enzalutamide showed activity as a second-line novel androgen receptor pathway inhibitor, whereas abiraterone acetate did not, leading to a longer time to second PSA progression for the sequence of abiraterone followed by enzalutamide than with the opposite treatment sequence. Our data suggest that using a sequencing strategy of abiraterone acetate followed by enzalutamide provides the greatest clinical benefit.

We investigated the immunological response and clinical outcome of vaccination with blood-derived CD1c+ myeloid dendritic cells (mDCs; cDC2) and plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs).  Methods:   In this randomized phase IIa trial, 21 chemo-naive CRPC patients received maximally 9 vaccinations with mature mDCs, pDCs or a combination of mDCs plus pDCs. DCs were stimulated with protamine/mRNA and loaded with tumor-associated antigens NY-ESO-1, MAGE-C2 and MUC1. Primary endpoint was the immunological response after DC vaccination, which was monitored in peripheral blood and in T cell cultures of biopsies of post-treatment delayed-type hypersensitivity-skin tests. Main secondary endpoints were safety, feasibility, radiological PFS (rPFS) and overall survival. Radiological responses were assessed by MRIs and contrast-enhanced 68Ga-prostate-specific membrane antigen PET/CT, according to RECIST 1.1, PCWG2 criteria and immune-related response criteria.  Results:   Both tetramer/dextramer-positive (dm+) and IFN-γ-producing (IFN-γ+) antigen specific T cells were detected more frequently in skin biopsies of patients with radiological non-progressive disease (5/13 patients; 38%) compared to patients with progressive disease (0/8 patients; 0%). In these patients with vaccination enhanced dm+ and IFN-γ+ antigen-specific T cells median rPFS was 18.8 months (n = 5) vs. 5.1 months (n = 16) in patients without IFN-γ-producing antigen-specific T cells (p = 0.02). The overall median rPFS was 9.5 months. All DC vaccines were well tolerated with grade 1-2 toxicity.  Conclusions:   Immunotherapy with blood-derived DC subsets was feasible and safe and induced functional antigen-specific T cells.

This progression might not indicate a real systemic drug resistance, but a selective monoclonal resistance. With the aim to delay the start of new line treatments we treated oligo-progressive sites with radiotherapy.  Methods:   From June 2011 to Febrary 2019, 29 consecutive metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) patients were submitted to radiotherapy for oligo-progression (1-3 sites) during ARTT for a total of 37 lesions treated. Thirty-one (83.8%) lesions were treated with conformal radiotherapy and 6 (16.2%) with stereotactic radiotherapy. After radiotherapy all patients continued ARTT.  Results:   Median OS (calculated from ARTT start) was 46,6 months (range 4.4-97.5 months), 2 and 3-year OS were 82.8 and 70.7%, respectively. Median PFS was 18,4 months (range 4.4-45.3 months), 2 and 3-year PFS were 38.3 and 8.5%, respectively. Median overall duration of ARTT treatment was 14.8 months (range 4.4-45.3 months) and median duration of ARTT after radiotherapy was 4.6 months (range 1-33.8 months). Patients submitted to radiotherapy > 6 months from the start of ARTT presented a better PFS (p < 0.001) and a trend toward a better OS (p = 0.101). None patient presented RT and drug related toxicities.

The goal of the present study was to investigate the genetic mechanisms of musk secretion of muskrats at the whole genome level. Comparative genomics illustrated obvious expansion in 809 gene families, of which nine gene families played pivotal roles in steroid biosynthesis, possibly related to muskrat musk secretion. We identified 1112 positively selected genes (PSGs) in the muskrat, including estrogen receptor 1 (ER1), an important influencing factor to the weight and size of the scented glands of muskrats. HSD17B3, HSD17B4, CYP7B1 and CYP17B1, crucial to steroid hormone biosynthesis, were under strong positive selection in the muskrat, and phylogenetic analysis of HSD and CYP450 classes revealed high gene diversity. Functional enrichment revealed many pathways associated with musk secretion and/or growth and degeneration of scented gland significantly, such as peroxisome, PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, apoptosis, and prostate cancer. Two muskrat-specific missense mutations (Pro237Thr and Ser297Ile) were detected in LIPC, which were reported to be involved cholesterol metabolic process. More importantly, the missense mutations discovered in LIPC were classified as deleterious by PolyPhen-2, possibly affecting the musk secretion of muskrats.""","""['Chuang Zhou', 'Yifan Zhang', 'Shi Qiu', 'Haoran Yu', 'Hongmei Tu', 'Qinchao Wen', 'Jake George James', 'Yang Meng', 'Yongjie Wu', 'Nan Yang', 'Bisong Yue']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Int J Biol Macromol""","""['Regulatory Roles of Peroxisomal Metabolic Pathways Involved in Musk Secretion in Muskrats.', 'Comparison of amino acid profiles and metabolic gene expression in muskrat scented glands in secretion and non-secretion season.', 'Adiponectin plays a role in energy metabolism for musk secretion in scent glands of muskrats (Ondatra zibethicus).', 'Research progress on musk secretion mechanism of forest musk deer.', 'Research progress on molecular genetics of forest musk deer.', 'Correlation Analysis between Muskrat (Ondatra zibethicus) Musk and Traditional Musk.', 'Chromosome-level Genome of the Muskrat (Ondatra zibethicus).']"""

Although there is awareness about potential patient positioning nerve injuries, iatrogenic nerve lesions are less described in the literature. Here, we report 3 cases of patients who presented with neuropathic painful complications due to RALP-associated nerve lesions.  Patient concerns:   A 62-year-old patient (case 1), a 72-year-old male (case 2), and a 57-year-old patient (case 3) presented at the clinic with symptoms of neuropathic pain after RALP surgery.  Diagnosis:   Patients were diagnosed with a potential injury of different branches of the pudendal nerve (cases 1 and 2), and left obturator nerve (case 3).  Interventions:   Patients underwent multimodal pharmacologic treatment through pregabalin, weak opioids, strong opioid, paracetamol, and adjuvants. In cases 2 and 3, a multidisciplinary approach was needed. As the patients responded to conservative treatment, invasive approaches were not necessary.  Outcomes:   After treatment, the patients of case 1 showed pain relief after 4 days, paresthesia resolved in 15 days, whereas the anal crushing sensation lasted for approximately 1 month. In case 2, after 4 weeks of treatment, the patient experienced a considerable decrement in pain intensity with complete response after 4 months. In case 3, pain relief was achieved after 2 days, motor symptoms recovery after 2 weeks, and neuropathic features resolved completely after 5 weeks although the obturator sign resolved within 2 months.  Lessons:   The RALP-associated neurologic injuries may occur even when performed by highly experienced surgeons. A better understanding of the potential iatrogenic nerve lesions can surely allow an improvement in the surgical technique. A multidisciplinary approach and early multimodal pain strategy are mandatory for managing these complications.""","""['Marco Cascella', 'Giuseppe Quarto', 'Giovanni Grimaldi', 'Alessandro Izzo', 'Raffaele Muscariello', 'Luigi Castaldo', 'Barbara Di Caprio', 'Sabrina Bimonte', 'Paola Del Prete', 'Arturo Cuomo', 'Sisto Perdonà']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Medicine (Baltimore)""","""['Is It Possible to Draw a Risk Map for Obturator Nerve Injury During Pelvic Lymph Node Dissection?

In this study, we evaluated the correlation between pre-treatment plasma fibrinogen and the burden of bone metastasis in newly diagnosed PCa patients.  Methods:   A single-center retrospective analysis, focusing on prostate biopsies of newly diagnosed PCa patients, was performed. A total of 261 patients were enrolled in this study in a 4-year period. All subjects were submitted to single-photon emission computerized tomography-computed tomography to confirm the status of bone metastasis and, if present, the number of metastatic lesions would then be calculated. Clinical information such as age, prostate-specific antigen (PSA), fibrinogen, clinical T stage, and Gleason score were collected. Patients were divided into three groups: (i) a non-metastatic group, (ii) a high volume disease (HVD) group (>3 metastases with at least one lesion outside the spine), and (iii) a low volume disease (LVD) group (metastatic patients excluding HVD ones). The main statistical methods included non-parametric Mann-Whitney test, Spearman correlation, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, and logistic regression.  Results:   Fibrinogen positively correlated with Gleason score (r = 0.180, P = 0.003), PSA levels (r = 0.216, P < 0.001), and number of metastatic lesions (r = 0.296, P < 0.001). Compared with the non-metastatic and LVD groups, the HVD group showed the highest PSA (104.98 ng/mL, median) and fibrinogen levels (3.39 g/L, median), as well as the largest proportion of Gleason score >7 (86.8%). Both univariate (odds ratio [OR] = 2.16, 95% confidential interval [CI]: 1.536-3.038, P < 0.001) and multivariate (OR = 1.726, 95% CI: 1.206-2.472, P = 0.003) logistic regressions showed that fibrinogen was independently associated with HVD. The ROC curve suggested that fibrinogen acts as a predictor of HVD patients, yielding a cut-off of 3.08 g/L, with a sensitivity of 0.684 and a specificity of 0.760 (area under the curve = 0.739, 95% CI: 0.644-0.833, P < 0.001).

It (L-AsnA) has been widely used in food processing industries as a promising acrylamide mitigating agent and as a therapeutic agent in the treatment of certain human cancers.  Objective:   Based on US Patent (4,433,054; 1984), L-asparaginase (L-AsnA) enzyme is immobilized by admixing the active enzyme on the polysaccharide to be in a gel form. The storage stability of immobilized L-AsnA enzyme and its anti-proliferation and antiviral activity were determined.  Methods:   In the present study, S. maxima was cultured at large scales (300 liter) for the production of enough extracellular L-asparaginase (L-AsnA) using modified (high N concentration) Zarrouk medium as we reported in a previous study. L-AsnA was immobilized on natural polymers, as agar cake beads, agarose pieces and gelatin blocks, in order to evaluate the efficiency of physical entrapment techniques. Anti-proliferation properties of L-AsnA against lung carcinoma A549, hepatocellular carcinoma Hep-G2 and prostate carcinoma PC3 human cancer cell lines were assessed by the MTT cell viability method. In addition, the antiviral activity against Coxsackie B3 (CSB3) Virus was assessed.  Results:   The highest L-AsnA immobilized activity and immobilization yield were achieved with agar cakes bead. The purified S. maxima L-AsnA showed good antiviral activity against Coxsackie B3 (CSB3) Virus in a dose-dependent manner with an IC50 value 17.03 μg/ml. The antiviral mode of action is presumably due to their capability of inhibiting attachment, blocking the adsorption and penetration event of the viral replication cycle with 89.24%, 72.78% and 72.78%, respectively. Also, S. maxima L-AsnA showed anti-proliferation effect against lung carcinoma A549, hepatocellular carcinoma Hep-G2 and prostate carcinoma PC3 human cancer cell lines, with an IC50 of 22.54, 24.65 and 56.61 μg/ml, respectively.  Conclusion:   It is interesting to favor L-asparaginase of S. maxima which showed antiviral activity and anti-proliferation effect against different types of human cell lines.

Herein, dual usage of microRNAs (miRNAs) as both valuable cancer biomarkers and direct self-assembly triggers is identified and capitalized upon for custom-designed plasmonic nanostructures. Through strict NA hybridization of miRNA targets, Au nanospheres selectively self-assemble onto hollowed Au/Ag alloy nanocuboids with ideal interparticle distances (≈2.3 nm) for optimal SERS signaling. The intrinsic material properties of the self-assembled nanostructures further elevate miRNA detection performance via nanozyme catalytic SERS signaling cascades. This enables fM-level miR-107 detection limit within a clinically-relevant range without any molecular target amplification. The miRNA-triggered nanostructure self-assembly approach is further applied in clinical patient samples, and showcases the potential of miR-107 as a non-invasive prostate cancer diagnostic biomarker.

Methods:   The study included men with incontinence postprostatectomy (PPI; n = 20), continent men postprostatectomy (PPC; n = 23) and a control group (CC; n = 20). Transperineal ultrasound imaging recorded motion associated with contraction of the striated urethral sphincter (SUS), puborectalis (PR) and bulbocavernosus (BC) muscles during maximal voluntary contraction (MVC), submaximal efforts, evoked coughing and bearing down. Anatomical landmark displacements were compared between groups and receiver operating characteristics were calculated to determine the threshold displacements that best differentiated PPI and PPC.  Results:   PPC demonstrated greater SUS, PR, and BC displacement than PPI during MVC (All: P < .01). During cough, PPC had less bladder neck descent (PR lengthening), and greater BC shortening (P = .003) than both PPI and CC. PPC also achieved greater SUS displacement (P = .025) than PPI during cough. The best discrimination between PPI and PPC was achieved when men exceeded threshold displacement for both SUS (≥4.1 mm) and PR (≥2.4 mm) during MVC. The urethral length was not different between PPC and PPI.  Conclusions:   Men who were continent postprostatectomy achieved greater shortening of the SUS, PR, and BC muscles than incontinent men during voluntary contractions and demonstrated better PR and BC function than control participants during coughing.

Recently, measurements of whole-body tumour burden by [68Ga]PSMA-11 PET/CT have been reported for response assessment in oligometastasic patients. The present study investigated the association of PSMA PET derived parameters and serum PSA level before and after [177Lu]PSMA-617 radioligand therapy (RLT).  Methods:   This retrospective study assessed whole-body PSMA tumour volume (PSMA-TV) in 10 patients with multifocal to diffuse metastases before and after 2 cycles of RLT using volume of interest (VOI) analysis. A standardized uptake value (SUV) threshold-based approach was used to semi-automatically delineate all voxels with a SUV ≥ 2.0 g/ml using the software ROVER® (ABX Radeberg, Germany). Voxels with physiological tracer uptake (e. g. kidneys) were excluded manually. Correlations between PSMA-TV and serum PSA level before and after two cycles of RLT as well as changes thereof (ΔPSMA-TV and ΔPSA, respectively) were calculated.  Results:   Changes of ΔPSMA-TV and ΔPSA were concordant in 7 of 10 patients. Whereas a good correlation was found between PSMA-TV and PSA before RLT (ρ = 0.81, p = 0.0049), this correlation was attenuated after RLT (ρ = 0.64, p = 0.0479). Consequently, no association was found between ΔPSMA-TV and ΔPSA (ρ = 0.39, p = 0.26).  Conclusion:   The attenuation of the correlation of PSA and PSMA-TV after RLT suggests that in patients with advanced disease the comparison of imaging based parameters such as PSMA-TV and PSA level might be useful for an adequate monitoring of treatment response.""","""['Kerstin Michalski', 'Michael Mix', 'Philipp T Meyer', 'Juri Ruf']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Nuklearmedizin""","""['Early molecular imaging response assessment based on determination of total viable tumor burden in 68GaGa-PSMA-11 PET/CT independently predicts overall survival in 177LuLu-PSMA-617 radioligand therapy.', 'Response assessment using 68Ga-PSMA ligand PET in patients undergoing 177Lu-PSMA radioligand therapy for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Excellent Response to 177Lu-PSMA-617 Radioligand Therapy in a Patient With Advanced Metastatic Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer Evaluated by 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT.', 'Therapeutic Responses and Survival Effects of 177Lu-PSMA-617 Radioligand Therapy in Metastatic Castrate-Resistant Prostate Cancer: A Meta-analysis.', 'PSMA radioligand therapy in patients with advanced prostate cancer.', 'The future of PSMA PET and WB MRI as next-generation imaging tools in prostate cancer.', 'Early molecular imaging response assessment based on determination of total viable tumor burden in 68GaGa-PSMA-11 PET/CT independently predicts overall survival in 177LuLu-PSMA-617 radioligand therapy.', 'Response Assessment and Prediction of Progression-Free Survival by 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT Based on Tumor-to-Liver Ratio (TLR) in Patients with mCRPC Undergoing 177Lu-PSMA-617 Radioligand Therapy.', 'Novel Tracers and Radionuclides in PET Imaging.', 'PSMA Expression Predicts Early Biochemical Response in Patients with Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer under 177Lu-PSMA-617 Radioligand Therapy.']"""

Vascularity quantity was assessed by SMI and compared with that of CDUS. The vessel parameter was also compared with the Gleason score. The sensitivity of PCa was compared between transrectal ultrasound guided systematic biopsy (SB) and SMI-guided targeted biopsy (SMI-guided TB). RESULTS Pathology confirmed 74 of 119 patients had PCa. The microvascular quantity of PCa patients was significantly higher than that of non-malignant patients. SMI detected blood vessels in 97.3% (72/74) in the malignant group, while CDUS identified blood flow signals in 90.5% (67/74) of the PCa group. SMI visualized enriched microvascular in PCa of Gleason 8 (54.5%) and Gleason 9 (92.3%). There was a positive correlation between microvascular quantity detected by SMI and Gleason score, with a correlation coefficient of 0.373 (P<0.001).

For breast cancers and lung cancers, target dose homogeneity in Onrad plans was better than that in 3DCRT. In the prostate plans, Onrad plans provided superior D95, conformity and homogeneity. The rectum doses of Onrad plans were lower than those with 3DCRT. Onrad plans provided superior homogeneity and D95 in head and neck cancer. The mean dose and V10-40 Gy of the parotid glands was lower using Onrad. In the cervical cancer plans, target doses were similar with both systems. Normal tissue doses were equal.  Conclusions:   Onrad is useful in the clinical setting. Onrad can achieve favorable or comparable dose distributions compared with those of 3DCRT in actual clinical treatment of breast, lung, prostate, head and neck, and cervical cancers.""","""['Taro Murai', 'Takeshi Tamura', 'Tadashi Nakabayashi', 'Hiroya Ito', 'Yoshihiko Manabe', 'Rumi Murata', 'Masanari Niwa', 'Yuta Shibamoto']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Kurume Med J""","""['Integral dose in three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy, intensity-modulated radiotherapy and helical tomotherapy.', 'Intensity-modulated radiotherapy using two static ports of tomotherapy for breast cancer after conservative surgery: dosimetric comparison with other treatment methods and 3-year clinical results.', 'Radiation therapy of synchronous bilateral breast carcinoma (SBBC) using multiple techniques.', 'Helical tomotherapy for radiotherapy in esophageal cancer: a preferred plan with better conformal target coverage and more homogeneous dose distribution.', 'Intensity-modulated radiotherapy for the treatment of prostate cancer: a systematic review and economic evaluation.']"""

However, the mechanisms underlying prostate cancer metastases remain unknown. Prostate cancer cells exhibited discrete adhesion to bone marrow endothelial cells (BMEC), resulting in osteotropic metastasis. Prior data showed an increased metastatic propensity of prostate stem cell antigen (PSCA)-positive prostate cancer cells. The current study sought to characterize the roles of PSCA in the adhesion of prostate cancer cells to BMECs. Cell adhesion was assessed using the adhesion assay and transendothelial migration. The expression and regulation of integrins were evaluated by qRT-PCR, Western blot, promoter-luciferase activity, and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP). Functionally, the potential interacting partners of PSCA in prostate cancer cells were identified by coimmunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry (MS) analysis. The association of PSCA expression with bone metastasis was further analyzed in an in vivo model and prostate cancer patients. We found that overexpression of PSCA enhanced the adhesion capability of prostate cancer cells to BMECs through upregulating integrin-α4 expression, concurrent with transcriptionally activated NF-κB. Growth factor progranulin (PGRN) was identified as a potential interacting partner of PSCA in prostate cancer cells. Functional studies showed that downregulation of PGRN and PSCA with siRNAs in prostate cancer cells significantly suppressed the integrin-α4 expression and the adhesion to BMECs in vitro, respectively, which were restorable by exogenous PGRN. Importantly, PSCA depletion significantly reduced tumors' presence in the bone of a mouse model. Furthermore, PSCA expression is elevated in prostate cancer tissue, and significantly associated with increased Gleason score, advanced stage, bone metastasis, and poor prognosis in prostate cancer patients. We conclude that PSCA/PGRN promoted the adhesion of prostate cancer cells to BMECs through NF-κB/integrin-α4 pathways, to facilitate metastases. IMPLICATIONS: The findings presented here suggest PSCA/PGRN as a potential therapeutic target for prostate cancer metastases, especially for bone metastasis.""","""['Zhigang Zhao#', 'Ermao Li#', 'Lianmin Luo#', 'Shankun Zhao', 'Luhao Liu', 'Jiamin Wang', 'Ran Kang', 'Jintai Luo']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Mol Cancer Res""","""['PSCA regulates IL-6 expression through p38/NF-κB signaling in prostate cancer.', '89ZrA2cDb Immuno-PET of Prostate Cancer in a Human Prostate Stem Cell Antigen Knock-in (hPSCA KI) Syngeneic Model.', 'Oncogenic miR-210-3p promotes prostate cancer cell EMT and bone metastasis via NF-κB signaling pathway.', 'Prostate stem cell antigen: a Jekyll and Hyde molecule?', 'Prostate stem cell antigen: a prospective therapeutic and diagnostic target.', 'Animal models of cancer metastasis to the bone.', 'The role of integrin family in bone metabolism and tumor bone metastasis.', 'Progranulin Oncogenic Network in Solid Tumors.', 'The Emerging Role of Cell Adhesion Molecules on Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia.', 'Recent advances in the molecular targeted drugs for prostate cancer.']"""

Objective:   To perform a comparison for the prediction of significant PCa (SigPCa) between the European Randomised Study of Screening for PCa (ERSPC) and the PCa Prevention Trial (PCPT) RCs in patients with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) between 3 and 10 ng/mL through an evaluation of the accuracy/variability between two consecutive PSA values.  Setting:   An observational study in a major university hospital in the south of Spain.  Methods and participants:   An observational study was performed in patients who underwent a prostate biopsy. SigPCa probabilities were calculated with the two PSA measures using ERSPC3/4+digital rectal examination and PCPT v2+free PSA RCs. The prediction of SigPCa was determined by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Calibration, discrimination and decision curve analysis were studied. The variability between both RCs' agreement was compared using Cohen's kappa coefficient.  Results:   510 patients were analysed (87 diagnosed with SigPCa). The median PSA values were 5.3 and 5 ng/mL for PSA1 and PSA2, respectively. Both RCs overestimated the risk in the case of high-risk probabilities. Discriminative ability for SigPCa was similar between models with an AUC=0.73 (0.68-0.79) for ERSPC-RC versus 0.73 (0.67-0.79) for PCPT-RC. ERSPC-RC showed less variability than PCPT-RC, with a constant agreement (k=0.7-0.8) for usual range of clinical decision-making. Remarkably, a higher number of biopsies would be avoided using the ERSPC-RC, but more SigPCa would be missed along all the risk probabilities.  Conclusions:   Both RCs performed similar in the prediction of SigPCa. However, ERSPC-RC seems to be more stable for intraindividual PSA variations.""","""['Enrique Gomez Gomez', 'Juan José Salamanca Bustos', 'Julia Carrasco Valiente', 'Jose Luis Fernandez Rueda', 'Ana Blanca', 'José Valero Rosa', 'Ines Bravo Arrebola', 'Javier Marquez López', 'Juan Manuel Jimenez Vacas', 'Raul Luque', 'Maria José Requena Tapia']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""BMJ Open""","""['Correction: Observational study comparing the accuracy/variability between the ERSPC and the PCPT risk calculators for the prediction of significant prostate cancer in patients with PSA <10 ng/mL.', 'Prostate cancer risk prediction using the novel versions of the European Randomised Study for Screening of Prostate Cancer (ERSPC) and Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial (PCPT) risk calculators: independent validation and comparison in a contemporary European cohort.', 'European Randomised Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer (ERSPC) risk calculators significantly outperform the Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial (PCPT) 2.0 in the prediction of prostate cancer: a multi-institutional study.', 'Prediction of prostate cancer risk: the role of prostate volume and digital rectal examination in the ERSPC risk calculators.', 'Do prostate cancer risk models improve the predictive accuracy of PSA screening?

Results:   Pentamidine exerted profound inhibitory effects on proliferation, colony formation, migration and invasion of prostate cancer cells. In addition, the drug suppressed growth of xenograft tumours without exhibiting any obvious toxicity in nude mice.

Clinical target volume (CTV)-planning target volume (PTV) margins are then used to deal with residual errors. We have investigated characterization of setup errors in patient populations with explicit modelling of occurring interfraction time trends.  Methods:   The core of a ""trendline characterization"" of observed setup errors in a population is a distribution of trendlines, each obtained by fitting a straight line through a patient's daily setup errors. Random errors are defined as daily deviations from the trendline. Monte Carlo simulations were performed to predict the impact of offline setup correction protocols on residual setup errors in patient populations with time trends. A novel CTV-PTV margin recipe was derived that assumes that systematic underdosing of tumor edges in multiple consecutive fractions, as caused by trend motion, should preferentially be avoided. Similar to the well-known approach by van Herk et al. for conventional error characterization (no explicit modelling of trends), only a predefined percentage of patients (generally 10%) was allowed to have nonrandom (systematic + trend) setup errors outside the margin. Additionally, a method was proposed to avoid erroneous results in Monte Carlo simulations with setup errors, related to decoupling of error sources in characterizations. The investigations were based on a database of daily measured setup errors in 835 prostate cancer patients that were treated with 39 fractions, and on Monte Carlo-generated patient populations with time trends.  Results:   With conventional characterization of setup errors in patient populations with time trends, predicted standard deviations of residual systematic errors ( Σ res ) after application of an offline correction protocol could be underestimated by more than 50%, potentially resulting in application of too small margins. With the new trendline characterization this was avoided. With the novel CTV-PTV margin recipe with an allowed 10% of patients having nonrandom errors outside the margin, the observed percentage was 10.0% ± 0.2%. When using conventional characterization of errors and the van Herk margin recipe, on average 58.0% ± 24.3% of patients had errors outside the margin, while 10% was prescribed. For populations with no time trends, the novel recipe simplifies to the generally applied M = 2.5 Σ + 0.7 σ formula proposed by van Herk et al. CONCLUSIONS: In populations with time trends in setup errors, the use of trendline characterizations in Monte Carlo simulations for establishment of residual errors after a setup correction protocol can avoid application of erroneous margins. The novel margin recipe can be used to accurately control the percentage of patients with nonrandom errors outside the margin. In case of daily image guidance of patients with multiple targets with differential motion, the recipe can be used to establish margins for the targets that are not the primary target for the image guidance (e.g., nodal regions). Probabilistic planning might be improved by using trendline characterization for modelling of setup errors. Population analyses of interfraction setup errors need to take into account potential time trends.""","""['Marta K Giżyńska', 'Paweł F Kukołowicz', 'Ben J M Heijmen']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Evaluation of multiple image-based modalities for image-guided radiation therapy (IGRT) of prostate carcinoma: a prospective study.', 'Evaluating the Need for Daily Image Guidance in Head and Neck Cancers Treated with Helical Tomotherapy: A Retrospective Analysis of a Large Number of Daily Imaging-based Corrections.', 'An assessment of action levels in imaging strategies in head and neck cancer using TomoTherapy.

Aim:   To assess the role of Mets on functional outcomes and complications after radical prostatectomy (RP) for prostate cancer.  Patients and methods:   Complete data were collected from 5758 patients, undergoing RP at a single referral centers in a 10-year period and the presence of MetS before surgery was ascertained in 17.7% of them using a modified version of the IDF-AHA/NHLBI criteria.

Results:   Postoperative continence (no pads) was significantly less likely in MetS patients (75.4% vs 82.6%, P < .01), despite no difference in preoperative continence. Erections with or without therapy were reached in 55.8% of non-MetS and 41.8% of MetS patients (P < .01), in this case a significant difference in preoperative function was seen.

We examined the association between four measures of social connectedness and mortality after a prostate cancer diagnosis. Male participants in the Melbourne Collaborative Cohort Study in 1990-1994, who developed incident prostate cancer and attended follow-up in 2003-2007, were eligible for the study. Information on social connectedness, collected at follow-up, included (i) living arrangement; (ii) frequency of visits to friends/relatives and (iii) from friends/relatives; (iv) weekly hours of social activities. A total of 1,421 prostate cancer cases was observed (338 all-cause deaths, 113 from prostate cancer), including 867 after follow-up (150 all-cause deaths, 55 from prostate cancer) and 554 before follow-up (188 all-cause deaths, 58 from prostate cancer). Cox models stratified by tumour Gleason score and stage, and sequentially adjusted for socioeconomic, health- and lifestyle-related confounders, were used to calculate hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) for the association between social connectedness and all-cause mortality after prostate cancer. Men who reported living alone before diagnosis had higher overall mortality (HR = 1.6, 95% CI: 1.0-2.5), after adjustment for socioeconomic, health and lifestyle confounders. Lower mortality was observed for men with more social activities (p-trend = 0.07), but not in comprehensively adjusted models. Consistent with these findings, men living alone after prostate cancer diagnosis had higher mortality (HR = 1.3, 95% CI: 0.9-1.9). Lower mortality was observed with increasing socializing hours in the age-adjusted model (p-trend = 0.06) but not after more comprehensive adjustment. Our findings suggest that living with someone, but not other aspects of social connectedness, may be associated with decreased mortality for men with prostate cancer.""","""['Zimu Wu', 'Nga H Nguyen', 'Dawei Wang', 'Brigid M Lynch', 'Allison M Hodge', 'Julie K Bassett', 'Victoria M White', 'Ron Borland', 'Dallas R English', 'Roger L Milne', 'Graham G Giles', 'Pierre-Antoine Dugué']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Int J Cancer""","""['Short-term androgen suppression and radiotherapy versus intermediate-term androgen suppression and radiotherapy, with or without zoledronic acid, in men with locally advanced prostate cancer (TROG 03.04 RADAR): 10-year results from a randomised, phase 3, factorial trial.', 'Socioeconomic disadvantage but not remoteness affects short-term survival in prostate cancer: A population-based study using competing risks.', 'Physical Activity and Survival After Prostate Cancer.', 'Recreational Physical Activity in Relation to Prostate Cancer-specific Mortality Among Men with Nonmetastatic Prostate Cancer.', 'Psychosocial interventions for men with prostate cancer: a Cochrane systematic review.', 'Neighbourhood social deprivation and risk of prostate cancer.', 'Psychosocial and Biological Outcomes of Immersive, Mindfulness-Based Treks in Nature for Groups of Young Adults and Caregivers Affected by Cancer: Results from a Single Arm Program Evaluation from 2016-2021.', 'Living alone as a risk factor for cancer incidence, case-fatality and all-cause mortality: A nationwide registry study.']"""

Methods:   From January 2011 to June 2016, 451 patients with prostate cancer were treated with 60 Gy (20 daily fractions). VMAT or 3D-CRT was used. Distribution by stage: 17% low-risk, 27.2% intermediate-risk; 39.2% high-risk, 16.6% very high-risk. Mean CCI was 3.4.  Results:   With a median follow up of 51 months, most patients did not experience any degree of acute GI toxicity (80.9%) compared to 19.1%, who experienced some degree, mainly G-I /II. In the multivariate analysis, only technique was associated with acute GI toxicity ≥ G2.

Methods:   A total of 912 cancer patients (457 breast, 241 prostate, 214 colorectal cancer) completed a questionnaire assessing their pre- and post-diagnosis PA behavior, and sociodemographic and medical variables. Age-adjusted regression and classification tree analyses were used to investigate PA determinants and detect subgroups that were most likely to meet or not meet PA guidelines.  Results:   Across cancer types, we found that PA yet decreased from pre- to post-diagnosis, but that 54.1% of participants still reported to be meeting PA guidelines after the diagnosis. While post-diagnosis PA was strongly affected by previous PA behavior among individuals of all patient groups, other sociodemographic and medical determinants played different roles depending on cancer type. The results yielded that previously active, longer diagnosed patients with higher education levels were most likely to be meeting PA guidelines post-diagnosis, whereas specifically previously inactive prostate cancer patients had an increased likelihood of insufficient activity.  Conclusions:   An encouragingly high number of cancer patients indicated sufficient PA levels.

Investigating and piloting novel recruitment strategies that take advantage of ubiquitous digital technologies has become an important component of facilitating broad recruitment and addressing inequities in clinical trial participation. Equitable and inclusive recruitment improves generalizability of clinical trial outcomes, benefiting patients, clinicians, and the research community. The increasing prevalence of online connectivity in the USA and use of the Internet as a resource for medical information provides an opportunity for digital recruitment strategies in cancer clinical trials. This study aims to measure the acceptability, preliminary estimates of efficacy, and feasibility of the Trial Library intervention, an Internet-based cancer clinical trial matching tool. This study will also examine the extent to which the Trial Library website, designed to address the linguistic and literacy needs of broader patient populations, influences patient-initiated conversations with physicians about clinical trial participation.  Methods:   This is a study protocol for a non-randomized, single-arm pilot study. This is a mixed methods study design that utilizes the statistical analysis of quantitative survey data and the qualitative analysis of interview data to assess the participant experience with the Trial Library intervention.

Methods:   Two prospective registries of prostate cancer patients treated between 2014 and 2019 were included. All men underwent Decipher tumor testing for adverse features post prostatectomy (Decipher Biosciences, San Diego, CA). The clinical utility cohort, which measured the change in treatment decision-making, captured pre- and postgenomic treatment recommendations from urologists across diverse practice settings (n = 3455). The clinical benefit cohort, which examined the difference in outcome, was from a single academic institution whose tumor board predefined ""best practices"" based on GC results (n = 135).  Results:   In the clinical utility cohort, providers' recommendations pregenomic testing were primarily observation (69%). GC testing changed recommendations for 39% of patients, translating to a number needed to test of 3 to change one treatment decision. In the clinical benefit cohort, 61% of patients had genomic high-risk tumors; those who received the recommended adjuvant radiation therapy (ART) had 2-year PSA recurrence of 3 vs. 25% for those who did not (HR 0.1 [95% CI 0.0-0.6], p = 0.013). For the genomic low/intermediate-risk patients, 93% followed recommendations for observation, with similar 2-year PSA recurrence rates compared with those who received ART (p = 0.93).  Conclusions:   The use of GC substantially altered treatment decision-making, with a number needed to test of only 3.

The results supported the use of a baseline WB-MRI screen in all adult TP53 pv carriers. Here we report the acceptability of WB-MRI screening and effects on psychosocial functioning and health-related quality of life in the short and medium terms.  Methods:   Psychosocial and other assessments were carried out at study enrolment, immediately before MRI, before and after MRI results, and at 12, 26 and 52 weeks' follow-up.  Results:   WB-MRI was found to be acceptable with high levels of satisfaction and low levels of psychological morbidity throughout. Although their mean levels of cancer worry were not high, carriers had significantly more cancer worry at most time-points than controls. They also reported significantly more clinically significant intrusive and avoidant thoughts about cancer than controls at all time-points. There were no clinically significant adverse psychosocial outcomes in either carriers with a history of cancer or in those requiring further investigations.  Conclusion:   WB-MRI screening can be implemented in TP53 pv carriers without adverse psychosocial outcomes in the short and medium terms. A previous cancer diagnosis may predict a better psychosocial outcome. Some carriers seriously underestimate their risk of cancer.

Therefore, technologies that can improve the visualization of tumor margins and adjuvant therapies to ablate remaining tumor tissues are needed during surgical resection of prostate adenocarcinoma. Photodynamic agents have the potential to combine both fluorescence for image-guided surgery (IGS) and photodynamic therapy (PDT) to resect and ablate cancer cells. The objective of this study was to determine the utility of a targeted PDT agent for IGS and adjuvant PDT. Using a previously developed prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA)-targeted PDT agent, PSMA-1-Pc413, we showed that PSMA-1-Pc413 selectively highlighted PSMA-expressing tumors, allowing IGS and more complete tumor resection compared with white light surgery. Subsequent PDT further reduced tumor recurrence and extended animal survival significantly. This approach also enabled identification of tumor cells in lymph nodes. In summary, this study presents a potential new treatment option for patients with prostate cancer undergoing surgery, which improves tumor visualization and discrimination during surgery, including identification of cancer in lymph nodes.

AR-independent treatment-resistant prostate cancer is a major unresolved clinical problem. Patients with prostate cancer with alterations in canonical WNT pathway genes, which lead to β-catenin activation, are refractory to AR-targeted therapies. Here, using clinically relevant murine prostate cancer models, we investigated the significance of β-catenin activation in prostate cancer progression and treatment resistance. β-Catenin activation, independent of the cell of origin, cooperated with Pten loss to drive AR-independent castration-resistant prostate cancer. Prostate tumors with β-catenin activation relied on the noncanonical WNT ligand WNT5a for sustained growth. WNT5a repressed AR expression and maintained the expression of c-Myc, an oncogenic effector of β-catenin activation, by mediating nuclear localization of NFκBp65 and β-catenin.

Despite this growing population, limited knowledge is available on age-related illnesses in adults with spina bifida, particularly prostate cancer for which there is no published data.  Objective:   Our aim was to describe inpatient care for prostate cancer in men with spina bifida in the United States.  Methods:   We performed a descriptive, retrospective study utilizing the 1998 to 2014 National Inpatient Sample from the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project. Weights were applied to the sample to make national level inferences. We identified all adult encounters (≥18 years old) with prostate cancer and spina bifida.  Results:   We identified 253 encounters (mean age 64.9 years). Most were Caucasian (67.5%) and had public insurance (61.6%). 44% of encounters included a major urologic procedure. 38.4% of encounters included prostatectomies, 28.3% included lymph node dissections, and 7.8% included cystectomies. Robotic surgery was performed in 9.4%. Mean length of stay was 5.6 days (95% CI: 3.7, 7.5). The average total cost was $14,074 (95% CI: $8990.3, $19,158.6).  Conclusions:   In this first-ever exploration of inpatient care for prostate cancer in men with spina bifida, we found that length of stay and total costs were higher in men with spina bifida.

We conducted a meta-analysis to explore the association between IL-8 rs4073 polymorphism and risk of prostate cancer.  Methods:   PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science databases were searched for only case-control studies published before February 2019. The methodological quality assessment of included studies was performed based on Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Scale (NOS). Based on the heterogeneity, we conducted a meta-analysis using random-effect models. Pooled odds ratios (ORs) with a 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated using the allele (T vs. A), homozygous (TT vs. AA), heterozygous (TA vs. AA), dominant (TT + TA vs. AA), and recessive (TT vs. TA + AA) genetic models to assess the strength of the relationship between IL-8 rs4073 polymorphism and prostate cancer risk. In addition, the stability of our analysis was evaluated by heterogeneity, sensitivity, subgroup of ethnicity and study design, and publication bias analysis.  Results:   We included 6 case-control studies with a total of 1752 cases and 1982 controls.

Objective:   To evaluate the clinical implications of LF after definitive RT.  Design, setting, and participants:   Individual patient data meta-analysis of 992 patients (593 Gleason grade group [GG] 4 and 399 GG 5) enrolled in six randomized clinical trials.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Multivariable Cox proportional hazard models were developed to evaluate the relationship between overall survival (OS), PCa-specific survival (PCSS), and distant metastasis (DM)-free survival (DMFS) and LF as a time-dependent covariate. Markov proportional hazard models were developed to evaluate the impact of specific transitions between disease states on these endpoints.  Results and limitations:   Median follow-up was 6.4 yr overall and 7.2 yr for surviving patients. LF was significantly associated with OS (hazard ratio [HR] 1.70 [95% confidence interval {CI} 1.37-2.10]), PCSS (3.10 [95% CI 2.33-4.12]), and DMFS (HR 1.92 [95% CI 1.54-2.39]), p < 0.001 for all). Patients who had not transitioned to the LF state had a significantly lower hazard of transitioning to a PCa-specific death state than those who transitioned to the LF state (HR 0.13 [95% CI 0.04-0.41], p < 0.001). Additionally, patients who transitioned to the LF state had a greater hazard of DM or death (HR 2.46 [95% CI 1.22-4.93], p = 0.01) than those who did not.  Conclusions:   LF is an independent prognosticator of OS, PCSS, and DMFS in high-grade localized PCa and a subset of DM events that are anteceded by LF events. LF events warrant consideration for intervention, potentially suggesting a rationale for upfront treatment intensification. However, whether these findings apply to all men or just those without significant comorbidity remains to be determined.

Exacerbated inflammation and angiogenesis have been largely demonstrated to contribute to PCa progression. Diverse naturally occurring compounds and dietary supplements are endowed with anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory and anti-angiogenic activities, representing valid compounds to target the aberrant cytokine/chemokine production governing PCa progression and angiogenesis, in a chemopreventive setting. Using mass spectrometry analysis on serum samples of prostate cancer patients, we have previously found higher levels of carnitines in non-cancer individuals, suggesting a protective role. Here we investigated the ability of Acetyl-L-carnitine (ALCAR) to interfere with key functional properties of prostate cancer progression and angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo and identified target molecules modulated by ALCAR.  Methods:   The chemopreventive/angiopreventive activities ALCAR were investigated in vitro on four different prostate cancer (PCa) cell lines (PC-3, DU-145, LNCaP, 22Rv1) and a benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) cell line. The effects of ALCAR on the induction of apoptosis and cell cycle arrest were investigated by flow cytometry (FC). Functional analysis of cell adhesion, migration and invasion (Boyden chambers) were performed. ALCAR modulation of surface antigen receptor (chemokines) and intracellular cytokine production was assessed by FC. The release of pro-angiogenic factors was detected by a multiplex immunoassay. The effects of ALCAR on PCa cell growth in vivo was investigated using tumour xenografts.  Results:   We found that ALCAR reduces cell proliferation, induces apoptosis, hinders the production of pro inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α and IFN-γ) and of chemokines CCL2, CXCL12 and receptor CXCR4 involved in the chemotactic axis and impairs the adhesion, migration and invasion capabilities of PCa and BPH cells in vitro. ALCAR exerts angiopreventive activities on PCa by reducing production/release of pro angiogenic factors (VEGF, CXCL8, CCL2, angiogenin) and metalloprotease MMP-9. Exposure of endothelial cells to conditioned media from PCa cells, pre-treated with ALCAR, inhibited the expression of CXCR4, CXCR1, CXCR2 and CCR2 compared to those from untreated cells. Oral administration (drinking water) of ALCAR to mice xenografted with two different PCa cell lines, resulted in reduced tumour cell growth in vivo.  Conclusions:   Our results highlight the capability of ALCAR to down-modulate growth, adhesion, migration and invasion of prostate cancer cells, by reducing the production of several crucial chemokines, cytokines and MMP9. ALCAR is a widely diffused dietary supplements and our findings provide a rational for studying ALCAR as a possible molecule for chemoprevention approaches in subjects at high risk to develop prostate cancer. We propose ALCAR as a new possible ""repurposed agent' for cancer prevention and interception, similar to aspirin, metformin or beta-blockers.""","""['Denisa Baci', 'Antonino Bruno', 'Caterina Cascini', 'Matteo Gallazzi', 'Lorenzo Mortara', 'Fausto Sessa', 'Giuseppe Pelosi', 'Adriana Albini', 'Douglas M Noonan']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""J Exp Clin Cancer Res""","""['Acetyl-l-carnitine is an anti-angiogenic agent targeting the VEGFR2 and CXCR4 pathways.', 'Sea cucumber extract TBL-12 inhibits the proliferation, migration, and invasion of human prostate cancer cells through the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase and intrinsic caspase apoptosis pathway.', 'Prostate Cancer Peripheral Blood NK Cells Show Enhanced CD9, CD49a, CXCR4, CXCL8, MMP-9 Production and Secrete Monocyte-Recruiting and Polarizing Factors.', 'Molecular targets for green tea in prostate cancer prevention.', 'Molecular pathways mediating the anti-inflammatory effects of calcitriol: implications for prostate cancer chemoprevention and treatment.', 'Exosomal PGAM1 promotes prostate cancer angiogenesis and metastasis by interacting with ACTG1.', 'L-carnitine Modulates Cognitive Impairment Induced by Doxorubicin and Cyclophosphamide in Rats; Insights to Oxidative Stress, Inflammation, Synaptic Plasticity, Liver/brain, and Kidney/brain Axes.', 'Skeletonema marinoi Extracts and Associated Carotenoid Fucoxanthin Downregulate Pro-Angiogenic Mediators on Prostate Cancer and Endothelial Cells.', 'Alterated gene expression in dilated cardiomyopathy after left ventricular assist device support by bioinformatics analysis.', 'The Potential Inhibitory Role of Acetyl-L-Carnitine on Proliferation, Migration, and Gene Expression in HepG2 and HT29 Human Adenocarcinoma Cell Lines.']"""

However, predictive blood-based biomarkers for stratification of patients for targeted therapy are still lacking. The DETECT studies explore the utility of CTC phenotype for treatment decisions in patients with HER2 negative MBC. Associated with this concept is a plethora of translational projects aiming to identify potential predictive biomarkers. The androgen receptor (AR) is expressed in over 70% of hormone receptor-positive and up-to 45% of triple-negative tumours. Studies has indicated the promising nature of AR as a new therapy target with a clinical benefit rate for anti-AR treatment in MBC patients up to 25% The aim of this analysis was the characterization of CTCs regarding the expression of the AR using immunofluorescence.  Methods:   MBC patients were screened for the HER2-status of CTCs in the DETECT studies. In a subset of CTC-positive patients (n = 67) an additional blood sample was used for immunomagnetic enrichment of CTCs using the CellSearch® Profile Kit prior to transfer of the cells onto cytospin slides. Establishment of immunofluorescence staining for the AR was performed using prostate cancer cell lines LNCaP and DU145 as positive and negative control, respectively. Staining of DAPI, pan-cytokeratin (CK) and CD45 was applied to identify nucleated epithelial cells as CTCs and to exclude leucocytes.  Results:   Co-staining of the AR, CK and CD45 according to the above mentioned workflow has been successfully established using cell lines with known AR expression spiked into the blood samples from healthy donors. For this translational project, samples were analysed from 67 patients participating in the DETECT studies. At least one CTC was detected in 37 out of 67 patients (56%). In 16 of these 37 patients (43%) AR-positive CTCs were detected. In eight out of 25 patients (32%) with more than one CTC, AR-positive and AR-negative CTCs were observed.

In low- and intermediate-risk prostate cancer (PCa) there is level 1 evidence that the Retzius-sparing approach impacts early continence recovery. Since specific data on aggressive and locally advanced cancer is lacking and avoiding rsRARP is presently suggested, we investigated urinary and sexual recovery, perioperative complications and early oncologic outcomes after rsRARP in this particular cohort.  Methods:   Prospectively collected data of 50 consecutive men (median age 66 years) with high-risk PCa who underwent rsRARP in a single institution was analysed retrospectively. The follow-up for all patients was 12 months after surgery.  Results:   3 vs. 12 months after surgery, 82% vs. 98% of men used no pad or one safety pad and 50% vs. 72% used no pad. 89% of patients did not observe a decline of continence if postoperative radiotherapy was carried out. Considering the 17 preoperatively potent patients who underwent bi- or unilateral nerve-sparing surgery, 41% reported their first sexual intercourse within 1 year after rsRARP. 84% of patients had ≥pT3a disease and 42% positive surgical margins. A lymphadenectomy was done in 94% of patients with a median lymph node removal of 15 and lymph node metastasis in 13%. 34% underwent adjuvant radiotherapy and 22% adjuvant androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). 1-year recurrence-free survival was 96%, including 25% of patients on adjuvant or salvage ADT.

Materials and methods:   We selected patients with prostate cancer for study who had available registered information on ISUP (International Society of Urological Pathology) based biopsy grading and multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging, and who had undergone radical prostatectomy with extended pelvic lymph node dissection. We developed a lymph node invasion prediction tool in 420 patients and externally validated it in 187. A concordance index was estimated to quantify the discriminative performance of the model.  Results:   In the development cohort a median of 21 lymph nodes were removed per patient and 71 patients (16.9%) were diagnosed with lymph node invasion. Statistically significant predictors of lymph node invasion were the initial prostate specific antigen value, multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging based T stage, maximum tumor length in 1 core in mm and ISUP grade group corresponding to the maximum tumor involvement in 1 core. The predictive accuracy of this lymph node invasion prediction tool was 79.7% after fivefold internal cross validation and 72.5% after external validation.  Conclusions:   We report a contemporary, externally validated prediction tool for lymph node invasion in patients with prostate cancer. This prediction tool is a response to the paradigm shift from systematic to targeted biopsies by incorporating additional core specific biopsy information instead of the percent of positive cores.

Although Forkhead box protein M1 (FOXM1) has been implicated in prostate tumorigenesis and metastasis, its role in docetaxel resistance has not been studied. Here, we showed that FOXM1 expression was upregulated in the docetaxel resistant CRPC cell lines (PC3-DR and VCaP-DR) and knockdown of FOXM1 sensitized the cells to docetaxel both in vitro and in vivo. In addition, autophagy was found to be significantly enhanced in resistant cells. Moreover, FOXM1 overexpression cells showed increased autophagic flux and higher numbers of autophagosomes. Knockdown of ATG7, beclin-1 or cotreatment with chloroquine, partly restored sensitivity to docetaxel in the FOXM1-overexpressing cells. Mechanistically, FOXM1 targeted AMPK/mTOR to activate the autophagy pathway and altered docetaxel response in CRPC.

The expression of two cell adhesion molecules, E-Cadherin and EpCAM, was upregulated by miR-96, and potential targets sites were identified in the coding sequences of their mRNAs. We further showed that miR-96 enhanced cell-cell adhesion between prostate cancer cells as well as their ability to bind to osteoblasts.

In addition to conventional magnitude averaging, phase-corrected real data were averaged in an attempt to reduce rician noise-bias, with a range of phase-correction low-pass filter (LPF) sizes (8-128 pixels) tested. Each method was also tested using simulations. Pixelwise maps of apparent diffusion (D) and apparent kurtosis (K) were calculated for magnitude data with and without NC and phase-corrected real data. Average values were compared in tumor, normal transition zone (NTZ), and normal peripheral zone (NPZ).  Results:   Simulations indicated LPF size can strongly affect K metrics, where 64-pixel LPFs produced accurate metrics. Relative to metrics estimated from magnitude data without NC, median NC K were lower (P < 0.0001) by 6/11/8% in tumor/NPZ/NTZ, 64-LPF real-data K were lower (P < 0.0001) by 4/10/7%, respectively.

To date, Decipher's genomic classification has not been extensively correlated with specific histologic growth patterns in prostatic adenocarcinoma. With a growing understanding of the clinical aggressiveness associated with cribriform growth pattern (CF), intraductal carcinoma (IDC), and percent Gleason pattern 4 (G4%), we sought to determine if their presence was associated with an increased genomic risk as measured by the Decipher assay.  Design:   Clinical use of the Decipher assay was performed on the highest Gleason score (GS) tumor nodule of prostatectomy specimens from a prospective cohort of 48 patients, with GS varying from 7 through 9 to help guide clinical risk stratification. The tumors were reviewed for CF, IDC, and G4%, which were then compared to the Decipher score (0-1) and risk stratification (high vs not high).  Results:   The presence of CF/IDC was significantly associated with Decipher risk score (P = .007), with a high-risk Decipher score in 22% vs 56% of patients without or with CF/IDC. On binary logistic regression analysis, G4% (odds ratio [OR] 1.04 per percent increase [95% confidence interval [CI], 1.02-1.06]; P = .0004) and CF predominant (OR, 9.60 [95%CI, 1.48-62.16]; P = .02) were significantly associated with a high-risk GC score. IDC did not reach significance (OR, 1.92 [95%CI, 0.65-5.67]; P = .24).  Conclusions:   Our findings add to an expanding knowledge base that supports G4% and CF/IDC as molecularly unique and clinically relevant features in prostatic adenocarcinoma. These histologic features should be standardly reported as they are associated with more aggressive prostate cancer. Future work should determine the independent information of these histologic findings that are relative to genomic assessment on long-term outcomes.""","""['Alexander S Taylor', 'Todd M Morgan', 'David G Wallington', 'Arul M Chinnaiyan', 'Daniel E Spratt', 'Rohit Mehra']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Transcriptomic Features of Cribriform and Intraductal Carcinoma of the Prostate.', 'Cribriform and intraductal prostate cancer are associated with increased genomic instability and distinct genomic alterations.', 'Not all gleason pattern 4 prostate cancers are created equal: A study of latent prostatic carcinomas in a cystoprostatectomy and autopsy series.', 'The 2019 Genitourinary Pathology Society (GUPS) White Paper on Contemporary Grading of Prostate Cancer.', 'Current Understanding and Management of Intraductal Carcinoma of the Prostate.', 'Cribriform pattern in prostate tissues: Predictor for intraductal carcinoma of the prostate based on biopsy and radical prostatectomy pathology.', 'Prostate Cancer Morphologies: Cribriform Pattern and Intraductal Carcinoma Relations to Adverse Pathological and Clinical Outcomes-Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.', 'Oncological outcomes of cribriform histology pattern in prostate cancer patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Large and small cribriform architecture have similar adverse clinical outcome on prostate cancer biopsies.', 'Diffusion Restriction Comparison between Gleason 4 Fused Glands and Cribriform Glands within Patient Using Whole-Mount Prostate Pathology as Ground Truth.']"""

Previously, FUsed in Sarcoma (FUS) was identified as an AR-interacting protein that enhances AR transcriptional activity. In the present study, we attempted to identify miRNAs that might target both FUS and AR to inhibit FUS and AR expression. Based on TCGA data and the online tools UALCAN, Kaplan Meier-plotter (KMplot), LncTar and miRWalk prediction, miR-133a-5p was selected. MiR-133a-5p expression was significantly downregulated in prostate cancer, and low miR-133a-5p expression was correlated with low survival probability. As predicted by LncTar and miRWalk, miR-133a-5p could bind to the 3'UTR of FUS and AR to inhibit their expression. MiR-133a-5p overexpression significantly suppressed the cell viability of the AR-positive prostate cancer cell lines VCaP and LNCaP, inhibited the expression of FUS, AR, as well as AR downstream targets IGF1R and EGFR. More importantly, miR-133a inhibition increased cancer cell proliferation as well as the expression of AR and AR downstream factors, while FUS knockdown exerted an opposite effect; the effect of miR-133a on cancer cell proliferation and AR could be significantly reversed by FUS knockdown. Moreover, IGF1R and EGFR knockdown reversed the effect of the miR-133a-5p inhibition. In summary, miR-133a-5p inhibits AR-positive prostate cancer cell proliferation by targeting FUS/AR, thus improving the resistance of prostate cancer to androgen ablation therapies, which requires further in vivo validation.

However, little is known regarding age-specific health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in PC survivors 5 years or even ≥ 10 years post-diagnosis.  Methods:   The sample included 1975 disease-free PC survivors (5-16 years post-diagnosis) and 661 cancer-free population controls, recruited from two German population-based studies (CAESAR+, LinDe). HRQoL in both populations was assessed using the EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire. Additionally, PC survivors completed the PC-specific EORTC QLQ-PR25 questionnaire. Differences in HRQoL between survivors and controls, as well as differences according to age and time since diagnosis were analyzed with multiple regression after adjustment for age, education, stage, and time since diagnosis, where appropriate.  Results:   In general, PC survivors reported HRQoL and symptom-burden levels comparable to the general population, except for significantly poorer social functioning and higher burden for diarrhea and constipation. In age-specific analyses, PC survivors up to 69 years indicated poorer global health and social functioning than population controls. Stratification by time since diagnosis revealed little difference between the subgroups. On PC-specific symptoms, burden was highest for urinary bother and symptoms, and lowest for bowel symptoms. Younger age was associated with less urinary symptoms but higher urinary bother.  Conclusion:   Long-term disease-free PC survivors reported overall good HRQoL, but experienced persistent specific detriments.

However, this treatment has side effects and at the time of the PSA era and extensive lymph node dissection, this principle is questioned. The aim of this study is to describe the oncological characteristics of patients that may explain the delay in introducing hormone therapy in patients with positive lymph node.  Methods:   Monocentric, retrospective study of 161 patients from November 1988 to February 2018 in a single French University Hospital, having undergone radical prostatectomy with positive lymph nodes on pathology. For each patient, preoperative data (age, clinical stage, biopsy results, d'Amico classification) and postoperative data (pathological results, number of lymph nodes removed, number of positive lympnodes, recurrence free survival, specific survival and overall survival) were collected. The date of introduction of hormone therapy was noted and survival without hormonal therapy was established according to the Kaplan Meier curve. The pre- and post-operative oncological factors that could influence hormone therapy introduction were investigated with Chi2 and Student tests (statistically significant when P<0.05).  Results:   The mean number of lymph nodes removed was 12 [1-40]. The mean number of positive lymph nodes was 2.5 [1-24], the mean percentage of positive lymph nodes was 25% (2.5-100). After a mean follow-up of 95 months (3-354), 88 patients (54.6%) had no hormonal treatment. The average time to hormonal treatment was 40 months [0-310]. At 3 years, survival without hormone therapy was 52% and 51% at 5 years. Only the percentage of positive lymphnodes appeared to be a significant predictor of the introduction of hormone therapy. (29.32% vs. 21.99%, P=0.047). Hormone-free survival was significantly higher in patients with lymph node involvement less than 25% (P<0.0001) or with less than 2 positive lymph nodes (P=0.0294).  Conclusion:   Lymph node invasion is a factor of poor prognosis after total prostatectomy and leads to introduce hormone therapy.

Aim:   The goal of this study was to assess the impact of AI on patient self-esteem, confidence, and sexual relationships.  Methods:   This was a retrospective study. The validated Self-Esteem and Relationship (SEAR) questionnaire, as well as questions regarding AI, stress urinary incontinence (SUI), climacturia, International Prostate Symptom Score, and the International Index of Erectile Function erectile function domain, were sent to men who had undergone an RP within the past 24 months at a single institution. The data were de-identified and analyzed using descriptive statistics.  Outcomes:   The outcomes of this study include prevalence of AI, SEAR domain scores, patient and partner bother, management strategies employed by the patients, and the presence of concurrent climacturia or SUI.  Results:   Fifty-three percent of men experienced post-operative AI; of these, 41% were currently experiencing AI, and 12% reported having prior AI that had resolved. Bother of any severity was reported by 87% of men, and perceived partner bother was reported by 64% of men. Forty-one percent of men with current AI avoided sexual activity due to the presence of AI, and 14% of men with prior AI still avoided intercourse. There was no difference in total SEAR score or in the subdomains of self-esteem, sexual relationship, or confidence between men with current AI compared to those with no AI.  Clinical implications:   AI leads to patient bother and avoidance of sexual situations.  Strengths & limitations:   This is the largest study specifically evaluating AI and the only study assessing its impact on self-esteem, sexual relationships, and self-confidence. Limitations include lack of a validated AI questionnaire, poor survey response rate, being a single-center study, and the potential for recall bias.  Conclusion:   Although AI is a common occurrence post-RP and is associated with patient bother in the majority of men, it does not impact overall self-esteem, confidence, or sexual relationships compared to post-RP men who have not experienced AI.

Aim:   To explore the relationship between erectile function, sexual satisfaction and sexual desire.  Methods:   We examined the Spearman correlation among erectile function (International Index of Erectile Function [IIEF-6]), sexual desire, and sexual bother in 3,944 questionnaires completed by patients after radical prostatectomy as part of routine care. IIEF-6 scores were adjusted if a patient indicated that the reason for not having intercourse was other than lack of ability of confidence (eg, lack of partner).  Main outcome measure:   Patient-reported outcome instruments.  Results:   Median age at surgery and preoperative IIEF-6 were 63 years and 26, respectively. Among questionnaires completed after surgery, there was moderate correlation among the IIEF-6 score and both sexual desire (Spearman rho: 0.41) and sexual bother (Spearman rho: 0.30). In men who reported high or moderate bother relating to sexual function, there was a narrow distribution of erectile function scores, with most men reporting poor function (median IIEF-6: 6, interquartile range 3, 11). For men who reported small or no problem with sexual function, the distribution of erectile function scores was wide, and particularly bimodal as a function of sexual desire. Among patients with high desire, the correlation between sexual bother and erectile function was 0.61 (ie, the poorer is your function, the greater you are bothered), whereas it was -0.081 among patients with low desire, meaning that some men are not bothered by poor erections.  Clinical implications:   We provided useful insights to help physicians during sexual counselling after surgery for prostate cancer.  Strength & limitations:   The study included a large number of patients and provides evidence for implementation of patient-reported outcome insturments. Limitations include the retrospective nature of our data.  Conclusion:   Sexual desire helps explain the moderate correlation between erectile function and sexual bother. Sexual desire and bother questions should be incorporated in patient-reported outcome instruments for male sexual function. Bravi CA, Tin A, Montorsi F, et al.

Aim:   The goals of this study are to describe the characteristics of men experiencing AI, outline the nature of their symptoms, and assess for predictors of this condition.  Methods:   A survey with questions on AI, stress urinary incontinence (SUI), the International Index of Erectile Function and International Prostate Symptom Score were sent out to men who had undergone an RP within the past 24 months at a single institution. The data were deidentified and analyzed using descriptive statistics. Comparisons between men with and without AI were made using t-tests and χ2 and Fisher exact tests. Logistic regression in univariable and multivariable analyses were used to define predictors of AI.  Main outcome measures:   The outcomes of this study included prevalence of AI, symptom severity and timing, patient and patient-perceived partner bother, management strategies used by the patients, and concurrent SUI.  Results:   226 (32%) men completed the survey. Of these men, almost half (49%) experienced AI at some point during their recovery. Improvement over time was endorsed by 62% of men. 57% of men reported AI in less than half of the sexual encounters, with the amount of urine leakage being equivalent to a tablespoon or less in 88% of men. On univariate analysis, increasing degree of SUI, as measured by pads per day, was associated with AI (P = .01). A lower International Prostate Symptom Score was also associated (P = .05). On multivariate analysis, the absence of hypertension and pads per day were associated with AI (P = .01 for both).  Clinical implications:   AI occurred in almost half of the respondents in our series. Thus, AI should be discussed with patients before surgery to allow for realistic expectations.  Strengths & limitations:   Strengths of this study include the largest patient population analyzed to date regarding AI and that it is the only one to address timing and patient experiences with the use of validated instruments for erectile and urinary function. Limitations include single-center data, non-validated AI patient-reported outcomes, and poor survey response rate.  Conclusion:   Based on the available data, AI is reported by almost half of men after RP and is associated with SUI. Bach PV, Salter CA, Katz D, et al.

Materials and methods:   A retrospective, single-center study was performed in 62 patients with radiorecurrent PCa who underwent MR imaging-guided cryoablation since May 2011 with a follow-up ≥12 months in December 2017. Rates and descriptions of adverse events were reported. Ablation complications were classified according to the Clavien and SIR systems. Validated questionnaires were used to observe functional outcomes and QoL before therapy and 6 and 12 months after therapy. Cancer control was defined as no biochemical failure according to Phoenix criteria and no other clinical evidence for local or metastatic disease.  Results:   All procedures were technically feasible. The number of complications requiring major therapy (Clavien grade 3b/4 or SIR grade D/E/F) was low (2 [3.2%] and 1 [1.6%], respectively). After 12 months, the International Consultation of Incontinence Questionnaire-Short Form (P < .001) and 5-item International Index of Erectile Function (P = .001) scores became significantly worse, indicating increased symptoms of incontinence and diminished erectile function, without compromising QoL. Six patients developed metastases within 6 months. After 12 months, 36 patients (63%) were disease-free.  Conclusions:   Focal salvage MR imaging-guided cryoablation is safe and is associated with a high technical success rate, preservation of QoL, and local PCa control. This treatment can be a reasonable alternative to salvage radical prostatectomy in properly selected patients with low morbidity and preservation of QoL; however, longer follow-up is needed.""","""['Joyce G R Bomers', 'Christiaan G Overduin', 'Sjoerd F M Jenniskens', 'Erik B Cornel', 'Emile N J T van Lin', 'J P Michiel Sedelaar', 'Jurgen J Fütterer']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""J Vasc Interv Radiol""","""['Salvage focal prostate cryoablation for locally recurrent prostate cancer after radiotherapy: initial results from the cryo on-line data registry.', 'Percutaneous MR-guided focal cryoablation for recurrent prostate cancer following radiation therapy: retrospective analysis of iceball margins and outcomes.', 'Salvage cryoablation for locally recurrent prostate cancer following primary radiotherapy.', 'Feasibility and safety of focal irreversible electroporation as salvage treatment for localized radio-recurrent prostate cancer.', 'Current salvage methods for recurrent prostate cancer after failure of primary radiotherapy.', 'Motorized template for MRI-guided focal cryoablation of prostate cancer.', 'Data-driven adaptive needle insertion assist for transperineal prostate interventions.', 'Recent progress in cryoablation cancer therapy and nanoparticles mediated cryoablation.', 'MR Imaging in Real Time Guiding of Therapies in Prostate Cancer.', 'Efficacy and Prognostic Factors of Androgen Deprivation Therapy Combined with Radiation Therapy for Prostate Cancer.']"""

Adjuvant chemotherapy is often required but this is associated with toxicity. Improved ways of delivering highly toxic chemotherapeutic drugs in a more controlled and targeted manner after the prostate has been removed during surgery could reduce the risk of recurrence and avoid systemic toxicity. The aim of this study was to develop a novel drug-device combination tissue scaffold that can be used to deliver the chemotherapeutic agent, docetaxel, into the tissue cavity that is created following radical prostatectomy. The device component investigated consisted of highly porous, poly(dl-lactide-co-glycolide) microparticles made using thermally induced phase separation. A facile method was established for loading docetaxel with high efficiency within one hour. Sustained drug release was observed from the microparticles when placed into a dynamic system simulating tissue perfusion. The drug released from the microparticles into perfusates collected at regular time intervals inhibited colony formation and exhibited sustained cytotoxicity against 3D spheroids of PC3 prostate cancer cells over 10 days. In conclusion, this study demonstrates the concept of combining docetaxel with the biodegradable microparticles at the point of care is technically feasible for achieving an effective drug-device combination tissue scaffold.

Methods In this multicenter study, data about expected time until RTW and potential correlates (personal, medical, psychosocial and work-related factors) were obtained from 822 employed cancer rehabilitation participants at the beginning of the program. Participants expecting early RTW (≤ 3 months) and delayed RTW (> 3 months) were compared. Hierarchical multivariate logistic regression was applied to study which factors are associated with expecting delayed RTW. Results In total, 171 cancer rehabilitation participants (21%) expected delayed RTW. Group comparison showed education, type of occupation, income, number of comorbid conditions, tumor stage according to the staging system of the Union for International Cancer Control (UICC), anxiety and depression, quality-of-life functioning scales, urinary and treatment-related symptoms, duration of sick leave, subjective work ability, perceived ability to return to the former job, intention to apply for a disability pension, effort-reward-imbalance and occupational stress to be associated in bivariate analysis with participants' expectations. Multivariate analysis revealed UICC tumor stage III (compared to stages I/II, OR 2.36), lower subjective work ability (OR 0.82), perceived inability to return to the former job (OR 1.88) and intention to apply for a disability pension (OR 1.94) to increase the likelihood of expecting delayed RTW. Conclusions Negative or non-beneficial RTW expectations, which are related to self-perception and behavioral intention, seem to be key factors for expecting delayed RTW.

RSP are conventionally obtained after mapping of the Hounsfield units (HU) from a calibrated patient computed tomography (CT). One or multiple CT are needed for a given treatment which represents additional, undesired dose to the patient. For prostate cancer, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans are the gold standard for segmentation while offering dose-less imaging. We here quantify the clinical applicability of converted MR images as a substitute for intensity modulated proton therapy (IMPT) treatment of the prostate.  Methods:   MRCAT (Magnetic Resonance for Calculating ATtenuation) is a Philips-developed technology which produces a synthetic CT image consisting of five HU from a specific set of MRI acquisitions. MRCAT and original planning CT data sets were obtained for ten patients. An IMPT plan was generated on the MRCAT for each patient. Plans were produced such that they fulfill the prostate protocol in use at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH). The plans were then recomputed onto the nominal planning CT for each patient. Robustness analyses (±5 mm setup shifts and ±3.5 % range uncertainties) were also performed.  Results:   Comparison of MRCAT plans and their recomputation onto the planning CT plan showed excellent agreement. Likewise, dose perturbations due to setup shifts and range uncertainties were well within clinical acceptance demonstrating the clinical viability of the approach.  Conclusions:   This work demonstrate the clinical acceptability of substituting MR converted RSP images instead of CT for IMPT planning of prostate cancer. This further translates into higher contouring accuracy along with lesser imaging dose.""","""['Nicolas Depauw', 'Jani Keyriläinen', 'Sami Suilamo', 'Lizette Warner', 'Karl Bzdusek', 'Christine Olsen', 'Hanne Kooy']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Radiother Oncol""","""['Proton Therapy for Prostate Cancer: Challenges and Opportunities.', 'Feasibility of MRI-only treatment planning for proton therapy in brain and prostate cancers: Dose calculation accuracy in substitute CT images.', 'Feasibility of MR-only proton dose calculations for prostate cancer radiotherapy using a commercial pseudo-CT generation method.', 'Comparing photon and proton-based hypofractioned SBRT for prostate cancer accounting for robustness and realistic treatment deliverability.', 'Empowering Intensity Modulated Proton Therapy Through Physics and Technology: An Overview.', 'Research progress on deep learning in magnetic resonance imaging-based diagnosis and treatment of prostate cancer: a review on the current status and perspectives.', 'Possibilities and challenges when using synthetic computed tomography in an adaptive carbon-ion treatment workflow.', 'A study to determine the impact of IMPT optimization techniques on prostate synthetic CT image sets dose comparison against CT image sets.', 'Proton Therapy for Prostate Cancer: Challenges and Opportunities.', 'Dosimetric impact of geometric distortions in an MRI-only proton therapy workflow for lung, liver and pancreas.']"""

Methods:   The cellular uptake and cytotoxicity effect of gold nanoparticles (PGPNPs and PGPNPs-FA) after 2 and 24 h treatment were evaluated in in both cancer (LNCaP) and normal (HUVEC) cells using fluorescent microscopy, Induced coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) and Tetrazolium bromide dye (MTT), respectively. The therapeutic efficacy was analyzed on the LNCaP cells. For this purpose, LNCaP cells were treated by nanoparticles and ionizing radiation, and the synergistic effect of treatment methods were evaluated by colony formation assay (CFA) and Flow cytometry analysis.  Results:   The results of fluorescence imaging and ICP-OES data showed that the LNCaP cells absorbed PGPNP-FA nanoparticles more than PGPNP (P < 0.001). Also, the uptake of nanoparticles was significantly greater in cancer cells than in healthy ones (P < 0.01). MTT assay results indicated higher cytotoxic effect of nanoparticles conjugated with FA in folate-receptor overexpressing LNCaP cancer cells compared to HUVEC normal cells (P < 0.01). Furthermore, CFA and Flow cytometry results demonstrated that combinatorial therapy of polymeric gold nanoparticles with/without FA and ionizing radiation at various doses (2, 4 and 6 Gy) had a synergistic effect on survival fraction and induction of apoptotic and necrotizing cell death (P < 0.01).

In recent years, through many researches, we found that miRNA functions as oncogene or cancer suppressor gene, and it plays an important role in the occurrence and development of tumors. Many researches also showed that miR-452 has different expression patterns and roles in different tumors. Its expression is significantly reduced in glioma, breast cancer, colorectal cancer and prostate cancer; however, the expression is significantly increased in liver cancer, renal clear cell carcinoma, esophageal cancer and urothelial carcinoma, etc. However, the role and mechanism of miR-452 in gastric cancer is still unclear. In this study, we found that miR-452 was highly expressed in both tumor tissue and gastric cancer cells, and could directly target the cancer suppressor gene EPB41L3 3'-UTR. miR-452 significantly promoted the proliferation, migration and the S-phase arrest of gastric cancer cells, but EPB41L3 as a downstream target gene of miR-452 reversed such promoting effect. While down-regulation of miR-452 expression significantly inhibited the malignant biological behavior of gastric cancer cells, but this inhibitory effect was reversed by EPB41L3 siRNA. In addition, miR-452 in the gastric cancer xenograft model in nude mice could down-regulated the expression level of EPB41L3 and promote the growth of transplanted tumor in nude mice. Taken together, this study reveals the role of miR-452 in gastric cancer via inhibiting the target gene EPB41L3, suggesting that miR-452 has the potential to become a new target for the diagnosis and treatment of gastric cancer.""","""['Xiaobo He', 'Ying Shu']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Pathol Res Pract""","""['miRNA-223 promotes gastric cancer invasion and metastasis by targeting tumor suppressor EPB41L3.', 'microRNA-1228⁎ impairs the pro-angiogenic activity of gastric cancer cells by targeting macrophage migration inhibitory factor.', 'Long non-coding RNA ZFAS1 promotes proliferation and metastasis of clear cell renal cell carcinoma via targeting miR-10a/SKA1 pathway.', 'The role of MiRNA-433 in malignant tumors of digestive tract as tumor suppressor.', 'The emerging role of miR-653 in human cancer.', 'MiR-1275 Targeting SPARC Promotes Gambogic Acid-Induced Inhibition of Gastric Cancer.', 'MicroRNA-452: a double-edged sword in multiple human cancers.', 'HDAC10 Inhibits Cervical Cancer Progression through Downregulating the HDAC10-microRNA-223-EPB41L3 Axis.', 'MiRNA-4537 functions as a tumor suppressor in gastric cancer and increases the radiosensitivity of gastric cancer cells.', 'The COX10-AS1/miR-641/E2F6 Feedback Loop Is Involved in the Progression of Glioma.']"""

Methods:   Medical records of consecutive patients over 60 years of age who underwent transurethral resection of the prostate for BPH between January 2009 and September 2012 were evaluated. As vascular risk factors, the presence or absence of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, current smoking, obesity, dyslipidemia, and diseases related to bladder function were investigated. As BPH-related factors, International Prostate Symptom Score, quality of life, maximal flow rate, postvoid residual volume, prostate-specific antigen, prostate volume, prostate calculi, and medication state for BPH were investigated. Immunohistochemistry was performed for hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF-1α), sex hormone receptors, and smooth muscle actin. Additionally, microvessel density (MVD) and diffuse fibrosis (DF) were evaluated.  Results:   A total of 101 patients were included and HIF-1α expression in stroma and glands were observed in 56 (55.4%) and 34 (33.7%) cases, respectively. There was no significant association between HIF-1α expression and vascular risk factors or BPH-related variables. However, there was a significant correlation between the HIF-1α expression in stroma and higher MVD. HIF-1α expression in the stroma was also significantly correlated with higher expressions of the androgen and progesterone receptors in the stroma. DF was frequently found in cases with higher HIF-1α expression in the stroma than in those with lower HIF-1α expression.  Conclusion:   In patients with response to ischemic changes of the prostate, HIF-1α expression could be confirmed, and the expression of the androgen receptor was significantly lower in these patients.

Methods and materials:   Patients with organ-confined, node-negative prostate cancer who had biochemical failure (prostate-specific antigen [PSA] less than 2.0) after prostatectomy were eligible for this phase 1 dose-escalation trial. Doses delivered were 35 Gy, 40 Gy, and 45 Gy in 5 fractions, given every other day. Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) was defined as Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (version 4.0) grade 3 or higher gastrointestinal or genitourinary (GU) toxicity within 90 days of treatment. Maximum tolerated dose was the highest dose to be tested where fewer than 2 of the patients experienced DLT. Patients completed quality-of-life questionnaires at regular time intervals.  Results:   Twenty-six patients completed treatment between October 2013 and December 2017. Three patients received 35 Gy, 8 patients received 40 Gy, and 15 patients received 45 Gy. The median follow-up was 60 months for 35 Gy, 48 months for 40 Gy, and 33 months for 45 Gy. No acute DLT events were observed. Late grade ≥2 and ≥3 gastrointestinal toxicity occurred in 11% and 0%, respectively, and late grade ≥2 and ≥3 GU toxicity occurred in 38% and 15%, respectively. No difference was observed in late GU toxicity between 40 Gy and 45 Gy. Sexual function scores were significantly lower in the patients receiving androgen deprivation therapy (P < .01). In all patients, the crude rate of PSA control (<0.2 ng/mL) was 11 out of 26 (42%).  Conclusions:   Dose escalation to 45 Gy did not result in acute DLT events, had similar rates of late grade 3 toxicity, and did not demonstrate higher rates of PSA control, compared with 40 Gy. While allowing for higher plan heterogeneity, the recommended dose for phase 2 study will be 40 Gy in 5 fractions.""","""['Sagus Sampath', 'Paul Frankel', 'Bianca Del Vecchio', 'Nora Ruel', 'Bertram Yuh', 'An Liu', 'Tsung Tsai', 'Jeffrey Wong']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys""","""['Outcomes of a Dose-Escalated Stereotactic Body Radiation Phase 1 Trial for Patients With Low- and Intermediate-Risk Prostate Cancer.', 'Phase I dose-escalation study of stereotactic body radiation therapy for low- and intermediate-risk prostate cancer.', 'Retreatment for Local Recurrence of Prostatic Carcinoma After Prior Therapeutic Irradiation: Efficacy and Toxicity of HDR-Like SBRT.', 'Preliminary toxicity and prostate-specific antigen response of a Phase I/II trial of neoadjuvant hormonal therapy, 103Pd brachytherapy, and three-dimensional conformal external beam irradiation in the treatment of locally advanced prostate cancer.', 'Salvage stereotactic body radiation therapy for locally recurrent prostate cancer following primary radiation therapy, are benefits worth toxicity risks?: A systematic review.', 'Preliminary Analysis of a Phase II Trial of Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy for Prostate Cancer With High-Risk Features After Radical Prostatectomy.', ""Three Months' PSA and Toxicity from a Prospective Trial Investigating STereotactic sAlvage Radiotherapy for Macroscopic Prostate Bed Recurrence after Prostatectomy-STARR (NCT05455736)."", 'Acute Toxicity and Quality of Life in a Post-Prostatectomy Ablative Radiation Therapy (POPART) Multicentric Trial.', 'A Phase 1 Trial of Highly Conformal, Hypofractionated Postprostatectomy Radiation Therapy.', 'Editorial: Stereotactic body radiotherapy for prostate cancer.']"""

In this study, we found that circFOXO3 was up-regulated in both PCa tissues and serum samples. Moreover, circFOXO3 was positively correlated with the Gleason score in PCa samples. CircFOXO3 was observed to be up-regulated in Gleason score > 6 PCa samples compared with Gleason score = 6 PCa samples. Knock-down circFOXO3 could remarkably inhibit PCa cell cycle, proliferation and promote cell apoptosis in vitro. Furthermore, we demonstrated circFOXO3 could act as miR-29a-3p sponge to up-regulate SLC25A15 expression by bioinformatics analysis, dual-luciferase reporter assays and biotinylated RNA pull-down assays. SLC25A15 could reverse the tumour suppressing roles of knock-down circFOXO3 in PCa.

Around 50% of PCa are characterized by TMPRSS2-ERG (T2E)-fusion oncoproteins defining two molecular subtypes (T2E-positive/negative). However, current prognostic tests do not differ between both molecular subtypes, which might affect outcome prediction. To investigate gene-signatures associated with metastasis in T2E-positive and T2E-negative PCa independently, we integrated tumor transcriptomes and clinicopathological data of two cohorts (total n = 783), and analyzed metastasis-associated gene-signatures regarding the T2E-status. Here, we show that the prognostic value of biomarkers in PCa critically depends on the T2E-status. Using gene-set enrichment analyses, we uncovered that metastatic T2E-positive and T2E-negative PCa are characterized by distinct gene-signatures. In addition, by testing genes shared by several functional gene-signatures for their association with event-free survival in a validation cohort (n = 272), we identified five genes (ASPN, BGN, COL1A1, RRM2 and TYMS)-three of which are included in commercially available prognostic tests-whose high expression was significantly associated with worse outcome exclusively in T2E-negative PCa. Among these genes, RRM2 and TYMS were validated by immunohistochemistry in another validation cohort (n = 135), and several of them proved to add prognostic information to current clinicopathological predictors, such as Gleason score, exclusively for T2E-negative patients. No prognostic biomarkers were identified exclusively for T2E-positive tumors. Collectively, our study discovers that the T2E-status, which is per se not a strong prognostic biomarker, crucially determines the prognostic value of other biomarkers. Our data suggest that the molecular subtype needs to be considered when applying prognostic biomarkers for outcome prediction in PCa.""","""['Julia S Gerke', 'Martin F Orth', 'Yuri Tolkach', 'Laura Romero-Pérez', 'Fabienne S Wehweck', 'Stefanie Stein', 'Julian Musa', 'Maximilian M L Knott', 'Tilman L B Hölting', 'Jing Li', 'Giuseppina Sannino', 'Aruna Marchetto', 'Shunya Ohmura', 'Florencia Cidre-Aranaz', 'Martina Müller-Nurasyid', 'Konstantin Strauch', 'Christian Stief', 'Glen Kristiansen', 'Thomas Kirchner', 'Alexander Buchner', 'Thomas G P Grünewald']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Int J Cancer""","""['Insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor affects the survival of primary prostate cancer patients depending on TMPRSS2-ERG status.', 'Nuclear C-MYC expression level is associated with disease progression and potentially predictive of two year overall survival in prostate cancer.', 'Expression of steroid and peptide hormone receptors, metabolic enzymes and EMT-related genes in prostate tumors in relation to the presence of the TMPRSS2/ERG fusion.', 'The prognostic and predictive value of TMPRSS2-ERG gene fusion and ERG protein expression in prostate cancer biopsies.', 'Urine TMPRSS2: ERG Fusion Transcript as a Biomarker for Prostate Cancer: Literature Review.', 'Identification of F-Box/SPRY Domain-Containing Protein 1 (FBXO45) as a Prognostic Biomarker for TMPRSS2-ERG-Positive Primary Prostate Cancers.', 'Overexpression of the orphan nuclear receptor NR2F6 is associated with improved survival across molecular subgroups in endometrial cancer patients.', 'Resistance to second generation antiandrogens in prostate cancer: pathways and mechanisms.', 'Identification and validation of an immune-related gene pairs signature for three urologic cancers.', 'The role of T2E mediated CBF-1/RBP-Jκ signaling in metastatic thyroid cancer.']"""

We examined these trends for highly aggressive PC at diagnosis among black and white men in Pennsylvania (PA).  Methods:   Men, aged ≥ 40 years, with a primary, clinical PC diagnosis were identified from the Pennsylvania Cancer Registry, 2004-2014. Joinpoint analysis was used to evaluate the temporal trend of highly aggressive PC (clinical/pathologic Gleason score ≥ 7 [4 + 3], clinical/pathologic tumor stage ≥ T3, or distant metastasis) and identify change points by race in which annual percent change (APC) was calculated. Logistic regression analyses were used to examine the association between race and highly aggressive PC, after adjusting for covariates with and without spatial dependence.  Results:   There were 89,133 PC cases, which included 88.7% white and 11.3% black men. The APC of highly aggressive PC was 8.7% from 2011 to 2014 among white men and 3.6% from 2007 to 2014 among black men (p values ≤ 0.01). The greatest odds of having highly aggressive PC among black compared to white men were found in counties where the black male population was ≤ 5.3%.  Conclusions:   Highly aggressive PC increased for both black and white men in PA between 2004 and 2014. Black men had more aggressive disease, with the greatest odds in counties where the black male population was small. The increase in highly aggressive PC may be due to less screening for PC, resulting in more advanced disease at diagnosis.""","""['Ming Wang', 'Guangqing Chi', 'Yosef Bodovski', 'Sheldon L Holder', 'Eugene J Lengerich', 'Emily Wasserman', 'Alicia C McDonald']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Cancer Causes Control""","""['Prostate-specific antigen values at the time of prostate cancer diagnosis in African-American men.', 'Prostate cancer in Pennsylvania: The role of older age at diagnosis, aggressiveness, and environmental risk factors on treatment and mortality using data from the Pennsylvania Cancer Registry.', 'Race and risk of metastases and survival after radical prostatectomy: Results from the SEARCH database.', 'The prevalence of prostate cancer in Brazil is higher in Black men than in White men: systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Racial disparities in prostate cancer among black men: epidemiology and outcomes.', 'A Problem in NIH and Federally Funded Prostate Cancer Interventional Clinical Trials.', 'Continuity of care and advanced prostate cancer.', 'Population-Level Patterns of Prostate Cancer Occurrence: Disparities in Virginia.', 'Sociodemographic and Geographic Disparities of Prostate Cancer Treatment Delay in Tennessee: A Population-Based Study.', 'The role of education on Cancer amenable mortality among non-Hispanic blacks & non-Hispanic whites in the United States (1989-2018).']"""

Although previous studies revealed no clinically relevant impact of older age on docetaxel pharmacokinetics (PK), this may be masked by indication. Metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) patients were reported to have approximately two-times lower systemic exposure compared to patients with other solid tumors. This study assessed the impact of older age on docetaxel PK, also considering the effect of indication on docetaxel PK.  Methods:   Prospectively collected docetaxel PK data from patients aged ≥70 was pooled with PK data from an earlier published multicenter study. A 3-compartment population PK model, including multiple covariates, was used to describe docetaxel plasma concentration-time data. We added the effect of prostate cancer (mCRPC and metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (mHSPC)) on clearance to this model. Hereafter, we evaluated the additional impact of older age on docetaxel clearance, using a significance threshold of p < 0.005.  Results:   Docetaxel plasma concentration-time data from 157 patients were analyzed. Median age in the total cohort was 67 years (range 31-87), with 49% of the total cohort aged ≥70. The impact of age on docetaxel clearance was statistically significant (p < 0.005). For a typical patient, a 10-year and 20-year increase of age led to a reduction in clearance of 17% and 34%, respectively.  Conclusion:   In this cohort study, age significantly and independently affected docetaxel clearance, showing lower docetaxel clearance in elderly patients. In our cohort, mCRPC and mHSPC patients both had higher clearance than patients with other solid tumors.""","""['Marie-Rose B S Crombag', 'Thomas P C Dorlo', 'Ellen van der Pan', 'Anoek van Straten', 'Andries M Bergman', 'Nielka P van Erp', 'Jos H Beijnen', 'Alwin D R Huitema']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Pharm Res""","""['Pharmacokinetics of docetaxel and ritonavir after oral administration of ModraDoc006/r in patients with prostate cancer versus patients with other advanced solid tumours.', 'Comparison of docetaxel pharmacokinetics between castration-resistant and hormone-sensitive metastatic prostate cancer patients.', 'Docetaxel-related toxicity in metastatic hormone-sensitive and metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Subsequent Chemotherapy and Treatment Patterns After Abiraterone Acetate in Patients with Metastatic Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer: Post Hoc Analysis of COU-AA-302.', 'Inter-patient variability in docetaxel pharmacokinetics: A review.', 'A pharmacometrics model to define docetaxel target in early breast cancer.', 'Albumin-Bound Paclitaxel: Worthy of Further Study in Sarcomas.']"""

Materials and methods:   The clinical data of 108 PC patients who received neoadjuvant ADT were retrospectively analyzed. All patients had a baseline 68Ga-PSMA-PET/CT scan, and a second scan was delivered median of 2.9 months after the initiation of ADT. The maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) of primary tumor (SUVp) and metastatic lymph nodes (SUVln) as well as PSA response were assessed between pre- and post-ADT 68Ga-PSMA-PET/CT scans.  Results:   There were significant decreases in posttreatment serum PSA, SUVp, and SUVln. A decrease in SUVp was seen in 91 patients (84%) with a median value of 66% (range, 5-100%), while 17 patients (16%) had no change in or an increase in PSMA tracer uptake with a median value of 24% (range, 0-198%). Patients with Gleason score (GS) of 7 had significantly higher metabolic response rates compared to other patients. The disease progression was significantly higher only in patients with GS > 7 disease compared to GS 7 disease. The PSA response to ADT was the lowest in patients with ISUP high-grade tumors. A total of 16 patients (15%) had progressive disease, and in 9 patients (8%), radiotherapy decisions were modified according to posttreatment 68Ga-PSMA-PET/CT scans.  Conclusions:   The current study includes the largest number of patients analyzed to date and demonstrates that ADT causes a significant decrease in serum PSA values and SUVp and SUVln.

We have previously reported favorable activity with low toxicity in a prospective phase II trial involving 30 men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. We now report their longer-term outcomes, including a 20-patient extension cohort and outcomes of subsequent systemic treatments after completion of trial therapy. Methods: Fifty patients with PSMA-avid metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer who had progressed after standard therapies received up to 4 cycles of 177Lu-PSMA every 6 wk. Endpoints included prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response (Prostate Cancer Working Group 2), toxicity (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 4.03), imaging response, patient-reported health-related quality of life, progression-free survival, and overall survival. We also describe, as a novel finding, outcomes of men who subsequently progressed and had further systemic therapies, including 177Lu-PSMA. Results: Seventy-five men were screened to identify 50 patients eligible for treatment. Adverse prognostic features of the cohort included short median PSA doubling time (2.3 mo) and extensive prior treatment, including prior docetaxel (84%), cabazitaxel (48%), and abiraterone or enzalutamide (92%). The mean administered radioactivity was 7.5 GBq/cycle. A PSA decline of at least 50% was achieved in 32 of 50 patients (64%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 50%-77%), including 22 patients (44%; 95% CI, 30%-59%) with at least an 80% decrease. Of 27 patients with measurable soft-tissue disease, 15 (56%) achieved an objective response by RECIST 1.1. The most common toxicities attributed to 177Lu-PSMA were self-limiting G1-G2 dry mouth (66%), transient G1-G2 nausea (48%), G3-G4 thrombocytopenia (10%), and G3 anemia (10%). Brief Pain Inventory severity and interference scores decreased at all time points, including at the 3-mo follow-up, with a decrease of -1.2 (95% CI, -0.5 to -1.9; P = 0.001) and -1.0 (95% CI, -0.2 to -0.18; P = 0.013), respectively. At a median follow-up of 31.4 mo, median overall survival was 13.3 mo (95% CI, 10.5-18.7 mo), with a significantly longer survival of 18.4 mo (95% CI, 13.8-23.8 mo) in patients achieving a PSA decline of at least 50%. At progression after prior response, further 177Lu-PSMA was administered to 15 (30%) patients (median of 2 cycles commencing 359 d from enrollment), with a PSA decline of at least 50% in 11 patients (73%). Four of 21 patients (19%) receiving other systemic therapies on progression experienced a PSA decline of at least 50%. There were no unexpected adverse events with 177Lu-PSMA retreatment. Conclusion: This expanded 50-patient cohort of men with extensive prior therapy confirms our earlier report of high response rates, low toxicity, and improved quality of life with 177Lu-PSMA radioligand therapy.

We evaluated epithelial-mesenchymal phenotypic characteristics across a range of tumor histologies using a validated, high-resolution digital microscopic immunofluorescence assay (IFA) that incorporates β-catenin detection and cellular morphology to delineate carcinoma cells from stromal fibroblasts and that quantitates the individual and colocalized expression of the epithelial marker E-cadherin (E) and the mesenchymal marker vimentin (V) at subcellular resolution (""EMT-IFA""). We report the discovery of β-catenin+ cancer cells that coexpress E-cadherin and vimentin in core-needle biopsies from patients with various advanced metastatic carcinomas, wherein these cells are transitioning between strongly epithelial and strongly mesenchymal-like phenotypes. Treatment of carcinoma models with anticancer drugs that differ in their mechanism of action (the tyrosine kinase inhibitor pazopanib in MKN45 gastric carcinoma xenografts and the combination of tubulin-targeting agent paclitaxel with the BCR-ABL inhibitor nilotinib in MDA-MB-468 breast cancer xenografts) caused changes in the tumor epithelial-mesenchymal character. Moreover, the appearance of partial EMT or mesenchymal-like carcinoma cells in MDA-MB-468 tumors treated with the paclitaxel-nilotinib combination resulted in upregulation of cancer stem cell (CSC) markers and susceptibility to FAK inhibitor. A metastatic prostate cancer patient treated with the PARP inhibitor talazoparib exhibited similar CSC marker upregulation. Therefore, the phenotypic plasticity conferred on carcinoma cells by EMT allows for rapid adaptation to cytotoxic or molecularly targeted therapy and could create a form of acquired drug resistance that is transient in nature.

Therapeutic options for AVPC are limited, and the development of novel therapeutics is significantly hindered by the inability to accurately quantify patient response to therapy by imaging. Imaging modalities that accurately and sensitively detect the bone and visceral metastases associated with AVPC do not exist.  Experimental design:   This study investigated the transmembrane protein CD133 as a targetable cell surface antigen in AVPC. We evaluated the expression of CD133 by microarray and IHC analysis. The imaging potential of the CD133-targeted IgG (HA10 IgG) was evaluated in preclinical prostate cancer models using two different imaging modalities: near-infrared and PET imaging.  Results:   Evaluation of the patient data demonstrated that CD133 is overexpressed in a specific phenotype of AVPC that is androgen receptor indifferent and neuroendocrine differentiated. In addition, HA10 IgG was selective for CD133-expressing tumors in all preclinical imaging studies. PET imaging with [89Zr]Zr-HA10 IgG revealed a mean %ID/g of 24.30 ± 3.19 in CD133-positive metastatic lesions as compared with 11.82 ± 0.57 in CD133-negative lesions after 72 hours (P = 0.0069).

Cell cycle arrest, apoptosis induction, and tumorigenesis suppression have been demonstrated following aloperine treatment. In a previous study, we demonstrated antitumor effects of aloperine on human thyroid cancer cells through anti-tumorigenesis and caspase-dependent apoptosis induction via the Akt signaling pathway. In the present study, we demonstrated the modulation of the autophagy mechanism following the incubation of multidrug-resistant papillary and anaplastic human thyroid cancer cells with aloperine; we also illustrate the underlying mechanisms, including AMPK, Erk, JNK, p38, and Akt signaling pathways.

The evolution of each metastasis is described as an independent branching process. We assume that the primary tumor is resected at a given size and study the earliest time at which any metastasis reaches a minimal detectable size. The parameters of our model are estimated independently for breast, colorectal, headneck, lung and prostate cancers. We use these estimates to compare predictions from our model with values reported in clinical literature. For some cancer types, we find a remarkably wide range of resection sizes such that metastases are very likely to be present, but none of them are detectable.

However, long acquisition time, high cost, and inter-center/reader variability of a routine prostate multiparametric MRI limit its wider adoption.  Purpose:   To develop and validate nomograms based on unique rapid biparametric MRI (bpMRI) qualitative and quantitative derived variables for prediction of clinically significant cancer (SPCa).  Study type:   Retrospective analyses of single (IMPROD, NCT01864135) and multiinstitution trials (MULTI-IMPROD, NCT02241122).  Population:   161 and 338 prospectively enrolled men who completed the IMPROD and MULTI-IMPROD trials, respectively.  Field strength/sequence:   IMPROD bpMRI: 3T/1.5T, T2 -weighted imaging, three separate diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) acquisitions: 1) b-values 0, 100, 200, 300, 500 s/mm2 ; 2) b values 0, 1500 s/mm2 ; 3) values 0, 2000 s/mm2 .  Assessment:   The primary endpoint of the combined trial analysis was the diagnostic accuracy of the combination of IMPROD bpMRI and clinical variables for detection of SPCa.  Statistical tests:   Logistic regression models were developed using IMPROD trial data and validated using MULTI-IMPROD trial data. The model's performance was expressed as the area under the curve (AUC) values for the detection of SPCa, defined as ISUP Gleason Grade Group ≥2.  Results:   A model incorporating clinical variables had an AUC (95% confidence interval) of 0.83 (0.77-0.89) and 0.80 (0.75-0.85) in the development and validation cohorts, respectively. The corresponding values for a model using IMPROD bpMRI findings were 0.93 (0.89-0.97), and 0.88 (0.84-0.92), respectively. Further addition of the quantitative DWI-based score did not improve AUC values (P < 0.05).

Materials and methods:   Demographics, PSA, transrectal ultrasonography volume and pathologic data were collected on patients who underwent their first ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy between January 2007 and June 2018 at a New York City Veteran Affairs Hospital.  Results:   609 biopsies were analysed preguideline (113 per year), and 487 were analysed postguideline (81 per year). There was no significant difference in the detection rates of low, intermediate or high grade PCa in Caucasians. In contrast, African Americans were significantly more likely to be diagnosed with PCa in the postguideline group (56% pre vs 66% post, P = .016), and significantly more likely to be diagnosed with intermediate-high grade PCa (38% pre vs 47% post, P = .038). Before the 2012 USPSTF recommendation, African American and Caucasian patients undergoing their first biopsy were equally likely to be diagnosed with high-grade PCa (11% AA vs 11% CA). After the 2012 decision, we found that African Americans were 50% more likely than Caucasians to be diagnosed with high-grade PCa on first biopsy (10% AA vs 15% CA, P = .008).  Conclusions:   In the 6 years following the 2012 USPSTF recommendation, detection rates of intermediate-high risk disease remained unchanged for Caucasian patients but have increased significantly for African Americans.

The TR4 nuclear receptor has been reported to play an important role in PCa progression, however, its linkage to the DTX resistance remains unclear. Here we found that TR4 was upregulated after DTX chemotherapy in the mCRPC cells and patients, and TR4 expression is correlated with DTX sensitivity with a higher level conferring chemo-resistance. Targeting TR4 with an antagonist bexarotene (Bex, a derivative of retinoid) suppressed the TR4 transactivation with increased DTX chemo-sensitivity. Mechanism dissection studies revealed that TR4 might alter the DTX chemo-sensitivity via modulating the TR4/lincRNA-p21/HIF-1α/VEGF-A signaling.

Here we present the whole-genome sequencing (WGS) analysis of fresh-frozen metastatic biopsies from 197 mCRPC patients. Using unsupervised clustering based on genomic features, we define eight distinct genomic clusters. We observe potentially clinically relevant genotypes, including microsatellite instability (MSI), homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) enriched with genomic deletions and BRCA2 aberrations, a tandem duplication genotype associated with CDK12-/- and a chromothripsis-enriched subgroup.

The subjects were 30 CRPC patients who received DTX at our hospital between January 2013 and October 2017. Twelve patients underwent primary prophylaxis with pegfilgrastim(Peg-G group), whereas the other 18 did not(control group). FN developed in 1(8.3%) and 8(44.4%)patients in the Peg-G and control groups, respectively(p=0.049). No significant differences were observed in RDI between the 2 groups. The average medical cost per course of DTX was lower in the Peg-G group than in the control group. These results demonstrate that primary prophylaxis with pegfilgrastim is useful because DTX induces FN at a high frequency in patients with CRPC, and pegfilgrastim significantly reduces its incidence without increasing the medical cost.""","""['Yoshimichi Koutake', 'Yasufumi Tsurusaki', 'Tsuyoki Fujita', 'Daisuke Inoue', 'Kiyonori Hanada', 'Yoshihiro Nakagawa']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Gan To Kagaku Ryoho""","""['Impact of pegfilgrastim as primary prophylaxis for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer patients undergoing cabazitaxel treatment: an open-label study in Japan.', 'Effectiveness of biosimilar filgrastim vs. original granulocyte colony-stimulating factors in febrile neutropenia prevention in breast cancer patients.', ""Cost-effectiveness of pegfilgrastim versus 6-day filgrastim primary prophylaxis in patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma receiving CHOP-21 in United States."", 'The impact of primary prophylaxis with granulocyte colony-stimulating factors on febrile neutropenia during chemotherapy: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.', 'Comparative effectiveness of granulocyte colony-stimulating factors to prevent febrile neutropenia and related complications in cancer patients in clinical practice: A systematic review.']"""

In this study, we designed a magnetic nanocube (scMNP) loaded in mesenchymal stem cells for magnetic hyperthermia of prostate cancer, and the delivery and transportation pathways into the cancer cells were fully investigated. The MSCs acted as the carrier of the loaded scMNPs along with the upregulation of CXCR4 for the migration to cancer cells. The therapeutic effect was mainly due to scMNPs via magnetic hyperthermia. Stem cell-derived microvesicles containing scMNPs played an essential role in the crosstalk between stem cells and cancer cells for targeted delivery.

Studies have explored reasons for selecting AS and for then switching to AT, but less is known about men's experiences being on AS. We interviewed men to determine the clinical and psychological factors associated with selecting and adhering to AS protocols.  Methods:   We conducted semi-structured interviews with men with a low-risk PCa at two academic medical centers. Subjects had either been on AS for ≥ 1 year or had opted for AT after a period of AS. We used an iterative, content-driven approach to analyze the interviews and to identify themes.  Results:   We enrolled 21 subjects, mean age 70.4 years, 3 racial/ethnic minorities, and 16 still on AS. Men recognized the favorable prognosis of their cancer (some had sought second opinions when initially offered AT), valued avoiding treatment complications, were reassured that close monitoring would identify progression early enough to be successfully treated, and trusted their urologists. Although men reported feeling anxious around the time of surveillance testing, those who switched to AT did so based only on evidence of cancer progression.

We evaluated temporal trends and factors associated with the use of surgical castration.  Materials and methods:   This retrospective cohort study sampled 24,805 men with newly diagnosed (de novo) metastatic prostate cancer from a national cancer registry in the United States (2004 to 2016). Multivariable logistic regression assessed the association between sociodemographic factors and surgery. Multivariable Cox regression evaluated the association between castration type and overall survival.  Results:   Overall 5.4% of men underwent surgical castration. This figure decreased from 8.5% in 2004 to 3.5% in 2016 (per year later OR 0.89, 95% CI 0.87-0.91, p <0.001). Compared to Medicare, private insurance was associated with less surgery (OR 0.73, 95% CI 0.61-0.87, p <0.001) while Medicaid or no insurance was associated with more surgery (OR 1.68, 95% CI 1.34-2.11, p <0.001 and OR 2.12, 95% CI 1.58-2.85, p <0.001, respectively).

Methods:   A four-room center treating approximately 90 patients/day, treating for approximately 7 years with optimized operations, underwent a software upgrade which reduced room and energy switching times from approximately 30 to 20 s and approximately 4 s to ~0.5 s, respectively. The center uses radio-frequency identification data to track patient treatments and has software which links this to beam delivery data extracted from the treatment log server. Two 4-month periods, with comparable patient volume, representing periods before and after the software change, were retrospectively analyzed.  Results:   A total of 16,168 and 17,102 fields were analyzed. For bilateral head and neck and prostate patients, the beam waiting time was reduced by nearly a factor of 3 and the beam delivery times were reduced by nearly a factor of 2.5. Room switching times were reduced more modestly. Gantry capacity has increased from approximately 30 patients to 40-45 patients in a 16-h daily operation.  Conclusions:   Many proton centers are striving for increased efficiencies. We demonstrated that reductions in energy and room switching time can significantly increase center capacity. Greater potential for further gains would come from improvements in setup and imaging efficiency.

Previous studies demonstrated the critical involvement of lncRNA histocompatibility leukocyte antigen (HLA) complex P5 (HCP5) in the development of cancers, however, the function of HCP5 in prostate cancer has not been reported. In the present study, we found the overexpressed expression of HCP5 in prostate cancer tissues and cell lines via RT‑qPCR analysis. High expression of HCP5 was positively correlated with the metastasis of prostate cancer. Downregulation of HCP5 inhibited the proliferation, colony formation and induced apoptosis of prostate cancer cells. Functional experiments demonstrated that HCP5 acted as a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) to sponge miR‑4656. Ectopic expression of HCP5 decreased the expression of miR‑4656 in prostate cancer cells. MiR‑4656 was found to be decreased in prostate cancer tissues and was negatively correlated with the expression of HCP5. Further luciferase reporter assay revealed that miR‑4656 was able to bind the 3'‑untranslated region (3'‑UTR) of the cell migration inducing hyaluronidase 1 (CEMIP) and suppressed the expression of CEMIP. Consistent with the negative regulation of miR‑4656 by HCP5, western blot analysis uncovered that overexpression of HCP5 upregulated the abundance of CEMIP in prostate cancer cells.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been used to aid prostate delineation, but its final accuracy is limited by MRI-CT registration errors. We developed a deep attention-based segmentation strategy on CT-based synthetic MRI (sMRI) to deal with the CT prostate delineation challenge without MRI acquisition.  Methods and materials:   We developed a prostate segmentation strategy which employs an sMRI-aided deep attention network to accurately segment the prostate on CT. Our method consists of three major steps. First, a cycle generative adversarial network was used to estimate an sMRI from CT images. Second, a deep attention fully convolution network was trained based on sMRI and the prostate contours deformed from MRIs. Attention models were introduced to pay more attention to prostate boundary. The prostate contour for a query patient was obtained by feeding the patient's CT images into the trained sMRI generation model and segmentation model.  Results:   The segmentation technique was validated with a clinical study of 49 patients by leave-one-out experiments and validated with an additional 50 patients by hold-out test. The Dice similarity coefficient, Hausdorff distance, and mean surface distance indices between our segmented and deformed MRI-defined prostate manual contours were 0.92 ± 0.09, 4.38 ± 4.66, and 0.62 ± 0.89 mm, respectively, with leave-one-out experiments, and were 0.91 ± 0.07, 4.57 ± 3.03, and 0.62 ± 0.65 mm, respectively, with hold-out test.  Conclusions:   We have proposed a novel CT-only prostate segmentation strategy using CT-based sMRI, and validated its accuracy against the prostate contours that were manually drawn on MRI images and deformed to CT images.

The aim of this health services research was to compare real-world data on the initial use of different GnRH agonists and antagonists (GnRHa) with regard to prescription patterns, hospitalisation rates and costs.  Material and methods:   Anonymised claims data from > 70 German health insurance funds between 2010 and 2015 (n = 4 205 227) were analysed (1 year pre-observation period, 1 index quarter with initial GnRHa prescription, ≥ 2 years of follow-up (FU)).  Results:   The study population included 2382 PCa patients (mean age 75 years). Leuprolide (Leu) was prescribed most frequently (56.6 %). At initial GnRHa administration, 70 % of patients neither had lymph node nor distant metastases. Around 11.2 % of all patients stopped GnRHa treatment after the first prescription, 17.6 % switched their initial therapy to another substance after a mean of 457 days (median: 399 days); in the hybrid (hyb) group 100 days earlier on average than in the agonist group (p = 0.016). The prevalence ranking of the most common comorbidities was consistent over time: hypertension, hyperlipidaemia, cardiovascular disease (CVD) and diabetes. The prevalence of hypertension increased significantly in the agonist group (16.4 %) compared with the antagonist (6.9 %, p = 0.022) and hyb group (11.6 %, p = 0.006). With regard to CVD, there were no significant differences in the relative growth rate between the 3 combined therapy classes. In total, 23.9 % of all patients died within the 3-year FU. The mortality rate was lowest for triptorelin (Trp, 22.1 %) and highest for goserelin (Gos, 29.4 %, n.s.). In the index quarter, 26.4 % of patients had at least one inpatient hospitalisation [min-max: Trp 22.4 %; Gos 30.3 %], with an average length of hospital stay/patient of 3 days [Trp 2.4; Gos 4.5]. The annual hospitalisation rate was between 36.2 and 40.7 %, the average length of hospital stay in the entire FU was between 17.6 (Trp) and 20.8 days (hyb). The average hospital costs in the index quarter were approx. EUR 1200 [Trp 988; Gos 1803] and per FU year approx. EUR 3000. In the Trp cohort, total costs (index quarter + 3 years) were more than EUR 1000 below the average costs of EUR 9476 [Trp 8116; Leu 9779; n.s.].

Patients and methods:   Men with adverse pathologic features, pT3 or positive surgical margins who underwent RP in 2010-2014 at Renji hospital were retrospectively analyzed. The primary outcome was biochemical recurrence (BCR) after RP. RNA was quantified from paraffin-embedded RP specimens. The CCP score was calculated as average expression of 31 CCP genes, normalized to 15 housekeeper genes. The prognostic utility of the CCP score was assessed using Kaplan-Meier analysis and multivariable Cox proportional hazards model.  Results:   Among the 100 men identified, 5-year BCR-free survival for the low- (< 0), intermediate- (0-1) and high- (> 1) CCP score groups was 89.3%, 38.8%, and 12.9%, respectively.

Conclusions:   The present study provides insights into the role the CCP score plays in risk stratification of this cohort and in determining candidacy for deferred secondary treatment.

Differential expression of Claudin-1 is linked to disease outcome in various cancers.  Material and methods:   To evaluate the potential relevance of Claudin-1 expression in prostate cancer, a tissue microarray containing samples of 17,747 tumors with annotated clinico-pathological and molecular data was immunohistochemically analyzed for Claudin-1 expression.  Results:   In normal prostate, glandular cells were always Claudin-1-negative while there was a strong staining of gland-surrounding basal cells. In contrast to normal prostatic glands, a positive Claudin-1 immunostaining, was found, however, in 38.7% of 12,441 interpretable cancers and was considered weak in 12.7%, moderate in 13.2%, and strong in 12.8% of cases. Positive Claudin-1 immunostaining was associated with favorable tumor features like low pT (p = 0.0032), low Gleason grade (p< 0.0001), and a reduced risk of PSA recurrence (p = 0.0005). A positive Claudin-1 staining was markedly more frequent in ERG-positive (63%) than in ERG-negative cancers (23%; p < 0.0001). Subset analyses revealed that all associations of Claudin-1 expression and favorable phenotype and prognosis were driven by ERG-positive cancers. Multivariate analyses revealed, however, that even in ERG-positive cancers, the prognostic impact of high Claudin-1 expression was not independent of established clinico-pathological parameters. Comparison with 12 previously analyzed chromosomal deletions identified conspicuous associations with PTEN and 12p13 deletions potentially indicating functional interactions.  Conclusion:   These data identify a peculiar role for Claudin-1 in prostate cancer.

Nonlinear microscopy (NLM) is a fluorescence microscopy technique that can rapidly generate images that closely resemble H&E histology in freshly excised tissue, without requiring freezing or microtome sectioning. Specimens are stained with nuclear and cytoplasmic/stromal fluorophores, and NLM evaluation can begin within 3 min of grossing. Fluorescence signals can be displayed using an H&E color scale, facilitating pathologist interpretation. This study evaluates the accuracy of prostate cancer detection in a blinded reading of NLM images compared with the gold standard of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded H&E histology. A total of 122 freshly excised prostate specimens were obtained from 40 patients undergoing radical prostatectomy. The prostates were grossed, dissected into specimens of ~10 × 10 mm with 1-4 mm thickness, stained for 2 min for nuclear and cytoplasmic/stromal contrast, and then rinsed with saline for 30 s. NLM images were acquired and multiple images were stitched together to generate large field of view, centimeter-scale digital images suitable for reading. Specimens were then processed for standard paraffin H&E. The study protocol consisted of training, pretesting, and blinded reading phases. After a washout period, pathologists read corresponding paraffin H&E slides. Three pathologists achieved a 95% or greater sensitivity with 100% specificity for detecting cancer on NLM compared with paraffin H&E. Pooled sensitivity and specificity was 97.3% (93.7-99.1%; 95% confidence interval) and 100.0% (97.0-100.0%), respectively. Interobserver agreement for NLM reading had a Fleiss κ = 0.95.

Skeletal muscle and fat indices were determined using computerized tomography data before initiation of chemotherapy. Sarcopenia was defined as SMI of <55 cm2/m2. Visceral-to-subcutaneous fat ratio and skeletal muscle volume were calculated with body composition specific areas. Harrell's concordance index was used for predictive accuracy.  Results:   A total of 154 (82.8%) patients met the criteria for sarcopenia; 139 (74.7%) individuals completed at least six cycles of docetaxel. Within a median follow-up of 24.1 months, age (HR 1.03, 95% CI 1.01-1.06, p = 0.02), high PSA (1.55, 95% CI 1.07-2.25, p = 0.02) and low skeletal muscle volume (HR 1.61, 95% CI 1.10-2.35, p = 0.02) were the only independent prognostic factor for tumor progression. Overall, 93 (50%) patients died during the follow-up period. The established prognosticator, the prechemotherapy presence of liver metastases (HR 1.32, 95% CI 1.08-1.61, p < 0.01) was associated with shorter OS. Moreover, we noted that patients with an elevated visceral-to-subcutaneous fat ratio tended to have a shorter OS (p = 0.06).  Conclusion:   The large majority of men with CRPC suffers from sarcopenia. In our cohort, low skeletal muscle volume was an independent adverse prognosticator for progression of disease. We could not detect a statistically significant body composition parameter for OS, although patients with a high proportion of visceral fat had a trend for shorter OS.

Tumor uptake was similar for all conjugates at 3 h pi, exceeding the uptake in all other organs. Higher kidney uptake and longer retention were associated with N-terminal negative charge (DOTAGA-containing conjugate). Tumor-to-organ ratios increased over time for all constructs, although significant chelator-dependent differences were observed. Concordant with affinity measurements, DOTA-analog had the best retention of activity in tumors, resulting in the highest tumor-to-blood ratio 24 h pi, which translated into high contrast PET/CT imaging (using 55Co).""","""['Bogdan Mitran', 'Helge Thisgaard', 'Sara Rinne', 'Johan Hygum Dam', 'Frishta Azami', 'Vladimir Tolmachev', 'Anna Orlova', 'Ulrika Rosenström']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Sci Rep""","""['Preclinical Evaluation of the Copper-64 Labeled GRPR-Antagonist RM26 in Comparison with the Cobalt-55 Labeled Counterpart for PET-Imaging of Prostate Cancer.', 'Selection of optimal chelator improves the contrast of GRPR imaging using bombesin analogue RM26.', 'The effect of macrocyclic chelators on the targeting properties of the 68Ga-labeled gastrin releasing peptide receptor antagonist PEG2-RM26.', 'Gastrin-releasing peptide receptor agonists and antagonists for molecular imaging of breast and prostate cancer: from pre-clinical studies to translational perspectives.', 'Nuclear imaging of prostate cancer with gastrin-releasing-peptide-receptor targeted radiopharmaceuticals.', 'Bioorthogonal Chemistry Approach for the Theranostics of GRPR-Expressing Cancers.', 'Production, Purification, and Applications of a Potential Theranostic Pair: Cobalt-55 and Cobalt-58m.', '66Ga-PET-imaging of GRPR-expression in prostate cancer: production and characterization of 66GaGa-NOTA-PEG2-RM26.', 'Preclinical Evaluation of the Copper-64 Labeled GRPR-Antagonist RM26 in Comparison with the Cobalt-55 Labeled Counterpart for PET-Imaging of Prostate Cancer.', 'New Frontiers in Molecular Imaging Using Peptide-Based Radiopharmaceuticals for Prostate Cancer.']"""

Furthermore, because hypermutated MMRd prostate cancers can respond to immune checkpoint inhibitors, there is an urgent need for practical detection tools.  Experimental design:   We analyzed plasma cell-free DNA-targeted sequencing data from 433 patients with mPC with circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) purity ≥2%. Samples with somatic hypermutation were subjected to 185 × whole-exome sequencing and capture of mismatch repair gene introns. Archival tissue was analyzed with targeted sequencing and IHC.  Results:   Sixteen patients (3.7%) had somatic hypermutation with MMRd etiology, evidenced by deleterious alterations in MSH2, MSH6, or MLH1, microsatellite instability, and characteristic trinucleotide signatures. ctDNA was concordant with mismatch repair protein IHC and DNA sequencing of tumor tissue. Tumor suppressors such as PTEN, RB1, and TP53 were inactivated by mutation rather than copy-number loss. Hotspot mutations in oncogenes such as AKT1, PIK3CA, and CTNNB1 were common, and the androgen receptor (AR)-ligand binding domain was mutated in 9 of 16 patients. We observed high intrapatient clonal diversity, evidenced by subclonal driver mutations and shifts in mutation allele frequency over time. Patients with hypermutation and MMRd etiology in ctDNA had a poor response to AR inhibition and inferior survival compared with a control cohort.  Conclusions:   Hypermutated MMRd mPC is associated with oncogene activation and subclonal diversity, which may contribute to a clinically aggressive disposition in selected patients. In patients with detectable ctDNA, cell-free DNA sequencing is a practical tool to prioritize this subtype for immunotherapy.See related commentary by Schweizer and Yu, p. 981.""","""['Elie Ritch#', 'Simon Y F Fu#', 'Cameron Herberts#', 'Gang Wang', 'Evan W Warner', 'Elena Schönlau', 'Sinja Taavitsainen', 'Andrew J Murtha', 'Gillian Vandekerkhove', 'Kevin Beja', 'Yulia Loktionova', 'Daniel Khalaf', 'Ladan Fazli', 'Igal Kushnir', 'Cristiano Ferrario', 'Sebastien Hotte', 'Matti Annala', 'Kim N Chi', 'Alexander W Wyatt']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Clin Cancer Res""","""['""Matching"" the ""Mismatch"" Repair-Deficient Prostate Cancer with Immunotherapy.', '""Matching"" the ""Mismatch"" Repair-Deficient Prostate Cancer with Immunotherapy.', 'Cell-free DNA profiling of metastatic prostate cancer reveals microsatellite instability, structural rearrangements and clonal hematopoiesis.', 'Circulating Tumor DNA Abundance and Potential Utility in De Novo Metastatic Prostate Cancer.', 'Mismatch repair deficiency may be common in ductal adenocarcinoma of the prostate.', 'Hypermutated tumours in the era of immunotherapy: The paradigm of personalised medicine.', 'Clinical Utility of Analyzing Circulating Tumor DNA in Patients with Metastatic Colorectal Cancer.', 'Management of Advanced Prostate Cancer in the Precision Oncology Era.', 'A generalizable machine learning framework for classifying DNA repair defects using ctDNA exomes.', 'The Somatic Mutational Landscape of Mismatch Repair Deficient Prostate Cancer.', 'Prostate Pathology: What is New in the 2022 WHO Classification of Urinary and Male Genital Tumors?', 'Prevalence of mismatch repair genes mutations and clinical activity of PD-1 therapy in Chinese prostate cancer patients.']"""

Material and methods:   This retrospective study considered histopathological examination findings or clinical follow-up data as the standard reference in the diagnosis of primary tumors, and results were compared with results of PET/CT scans.  Results:   The study included 100 patients with BMUO (74 males, 26 females, mean age 61 years). The primary origin was identified in 92 of the 100 patients. Adenocarcinoma was the most common histopathological subtype in patients in whom the primary origin of tumor was detected (65.2%). The most common primary tumor was lung carcinoma (n=52) followed by prostate (n=13), breast (n=7), colon (n=4), gastric (n=3), ovarian (n=2), renal cell (n=2), adrenal (n=1), thyroid (n=1), endometrial (n=1) and parotid (n=1) carcinoma, hepatobiliary cancers (n=2), leiomyosarcoma (n=2) and maxillary sinus tumor (n=1). The numbers of patients in whom PET/CT showed true positive, true negative, false positive (FP) and false negative (FN) results were 72, 7, 8 and 13, respectively. The sensitivity, specificity, accuracy and detection rate of PET/CT in detecting the primary tumor were 84.7%, 46%, 79% and 72%, respectively. The overall survival was significantly lower in lung cancer group when compared to non-lung cancer group, whereas it was significantly higher in prostate cancer group than in non-prostate cancer group.

The supervised approach succeeded in classifying the metastatic cell lines depending on their glucose metabolism, more glycolysis-oriented in the BRAF proto-oncogene mutated cell lines compared to the others. Other adaptive metabolic features also contributed to the classification, such as the increased total choline content (tCho), UDP-GlcNAc detection, and various changes in the glucose-related metabolites tree, giving additional information about the metastatic metabolome status and direction.

Patient navigation (PN) and lay community health workers or promotores are effective in increasing cancer screening and early-stage diagnosis among Latinos. However, little is known about the effect of PN on HRQOL among Latino cancer survivors.  Methods:   Latinos previously diagnosed with breast, prostate, or colorectal cancer (n = 288) were randomized to 1 of 2 conditions: 1) the Patient Navigator LIVESTRONG Cancer Navigation Services (PN-LCNS) survivor care program or 2) PN only. HRQOL was measured with the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General, and cancer-specific HRQOL was measured with the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Breast, the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Prostate, and the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Colorectal for breast, prostate, and colorectal cancer survivors, respectively, at the baseline and at 3 follow-up time points. Generalized estimating equation analyses were conducted to estimate the effect of condition on HRQOL with adjustments for covariates and baseline HRQOL.  Results:   PN-LCNS demonstrated a significant improvement in HRQOL in comparison with PN only for colorectal cancer survivors but not for breast and prostate cancer survivors.

To reduce unnecessary biopsies, here we designed an improved predictive model of MRI-based prostate volume and associated zone-adjusted prostate-specific antigen (PSA) concentrations for diagnosing PCa and risk stratification. Multiparametric MRI administered to 422 consecutive patients before initial transrectal ultrasonography-guided 13-core prostate biopsies from January 2012 to March 2018 at Fujian Medical University Union Hospital. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses and determination of the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was performed to evaluate and integrate the predictors of PCa and high-risk prostate cancer (HR-PCa). The detection rates of PCa was 43.84% (185/422). And the detection rates of HR-PCa was 71.35% (132/185) in PCa patients. Multivariate analysis revealed that prostate volume(PV), PSA density(PSAD), transitional zone volume(TZV), PSA density of the transitional zone(PSADTZ), and MR were independent predictors of PCa and HR-PCa. PSA, peripheral zone volume(PZV) and PSA density of the peripheral zone(PSADPZ) were independent predictors of PCa but not HR-PCa. The AUC of our best predictive model including PSA + PV + PSAD + MR + TZV or PSA + PV + PSAD + MR + PZV was 0.906 for PCa. The AUC of the best predictive model of PV + PSAD + MR + TZV was 0.893 for HR-PCa.

Methods:   A cross-sectional design was used. A total of 132 prostate cancer patients, drawn from outpatient clinics of 2 medical centers, who were receiving ADT were included. Structured questionnaires, including a basic information sheet, the Positive Thinking Scale, Social Support Scale, and Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Prostate (FACT-P), were used for data collection. Statistical analysis was performed by using independent-sample t tests, one-way analysis of variance, Pearson correlation, and multiple regression.  Results:   Prostate cancer patients who were receiving ADT were more likely to engage in positive thinking, which was correlated with better social/family well-being, emotional well-being, functional well-being, prostate cancer concern, and a higher score on the FACT-P. Improved self-reported health status was correlated better with all subdimensions of HRQoL and better scores on the FACT-P. Greater social support was correlated with high social/family well-being.  Conclusions:   Positive thinking, self-reported health status, and social support are important associated factors of HRQoL in prostate cancer patients who receive ADT.

A combination of the two ultrasound (US) modalities using computer aid may be helpful for improving the diagnostic performance. A technique for computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) of PCa is presented based on multimodal US. Firstly, quantitative features are extracted from both B-mode US images and sonoelastograms, including intensity statistics, regional percentile features, gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) texture features and binary texture features. Secondly, a deep network named PGBM-RBM2 is proposed to learn and fuse multimodal features, which is composed of the point-wise gated Boltzmann machine (PGBM) and two layers of the restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs). Finally, the support vector machine (SVM) is used for prostatic disease classification. Experimental evaluation was conducted on 313 multimodal US images of the prostate from 103 patients with prostatic diseases (47 malignant and 56 benign). Under five-fold cross-validation, the classification sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, Youden's index and area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve with the PGBM-RBM2 were 87.0%, 88.8%, 87.9%, 75.8% and 0.851, respectively.

The hazard ratio (HR) of death as well as other outcomes was compared between IGRT and non-IGRT matched groups during the entire follow-up period. The impact of additional covariables was considered in the sensitivity analysis.  Results:   Our study population included 590 patients in the primary analysis. The HR for death when IGRT was compared with non-IGRT was 0.92 (95% confidence interval 0.77-1.10, P = 0.35). There were also no significant differences for other outcomes or sensitivity analyses.  Conclusions:   In this updated nonrandomized study using real world data, we found that the overall survival of LA-ESqCC patients treated with dCCRT was not statistically different between those treated with IGRT versus those without IGRT, although the hazard ratio was less than unity, ie, in favor of IGRT. The results should be interpreted with caution given the nonrandomized design and RCTs are needed to clarify our findings.  Key points:   Significant findings of the study: The OS of LA-ESqCC patients treated with dCCRT was not statistically different between those treated with IGRT versus those without IGRT, although the hazard ratio was less than unity, ie, in favor of IGRT.  What this study adds:   In this updated nonrandomized study using real world data with additional potential confounders, our study provided a reasonable tentative evidence of lack of RCT as suggested in the literature.""","""['Yao-Hung Kuo', 'Hsin-Yuan Fang', 'Yu-Sen Lin', 'Ming-Yu Lein', 'Chi-Ying Yang', 'Shih-Chi Ho', 'Chia-Chin Li', 'Chun-Ru Chien']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Thorac Cancer""","""['Effectiveness of image-guided radiotherapy for locally advanced lung cancer patients treated with definitive concurrent chemoradiotherapy.', 'Effectiveness of image-guided radiotherapy for rectal cancer patients treated with neoadjuvant concurrent chemoradiotherapy: A population-based propensity score-matched analysis.', 'Impact of the interval between neoadjuvant concurrent chemoradiotherapy and esophagectomy in the modern era: a population-based propensity-score-matched retrospective cohort study in Asia.', 'Effect of modern high-dose versus standard-dose radiation in definitive concurrent chemo-radiotherapy on outcome of esophageal squamous cell cancer: a meta-analysis.', '(Neo)adjuvant Chemoradiotherapy is Beneficial to the Long-term Survival of Locally Advanced Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma: A Network Meta-analysis.', 'Effectiveness evaluation of adjuvant concurrent chemoradiotherapy for patients with positron emission tomography-staged esophageal squamous cell carcinoma after complete resection: A population-based cohort study.', 'Long-term clinical outcomes of lipiodol marking using standard gastroscopy for image-guided radiotherapy of upper gastrointestinal cancers.', 'Optimal radiotherapy dose in cervical esophageal squamous cell carcinoma patients treated with definitive concurrent chemoradiotherapy: A population based study.', 'Effectiveness of Image-Guided Radiotherapy in Adjuvant Radiotherapy on Survival for Localized Breast Cancer: A Population-Based Analysis.', 'Safety of image-guided radiotherapy in definitive radiotherapy for localized prostate cancer: a population-based analysis.']"""

PSMA antibody-drug conjugate (PSMA ADC) is a fully human immunoglobulin G1 anti-PSMA monoclonal antibody conjugated to monomethylauristatin E, which binds to PSMA-positive cells and induces cytotoxicity. In a phase 1 study, PSMA ADC was well tolerated and demonstrated activity as measured by reductions in serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and circulating tumor cells (CTCs). To further assess PSMA ADC, we conducted a phase 2 trial in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) subjects who progressed following abiraterone/enzalutamide (abi/enz) therapy.  Methods:   A total of 119 (84 chemotherapy-experienced and 35 chemotherapy-naïve) subjects were administered PSMA ADC 2.5 or 2.3 mg/kg IV q3w for up to eight cycles. Antitumor activity (best percentage declines in PSA and CTCs from baseline and tumor responses through radiological imaging), exploratory biomarkers, and safety (monitoring of adverse events [AEs], clinical laboratory tests, and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status) were assessed.  Results:   PSA declines ≥50% occurred in 14% of all treated (n = 113) and 21% of chemotherapy-naïve subjects (n = 34). CTC declines ≥50% were seen in 78% of all treated (n = 77; number of subjects with ≥5 CTCs at baseline and a posttreatment result) and 89% of chemotherapy-naïve subjects (n = 19); 47% of all treated and 53% of chemotherapy-naïve subjects had a transition from ≥5 to less than 5 CTCs/7.5 mL blood at some point during the study. PSA and CTC reductions were associated with high PSMA expression (CTCs or tumor tissue) and low neuroendocrine serum markers. In the chemotherapy-experienced group, the best overall radiologic response to PSMA ADC treatment was stable disease in 51 (60.7%) subjects; 5.7% of subjects in the chemotherapy-naïve group had partial responses. The most common treatment-related AEs ≥Common Terminology Criteria for AE (CTCAE) grade 3 were neutropenia, fatigue, electrolyte imbalance, anemia, and neuropathy. The most common serious AEs were dehydration, hyponatremia, febrile neutropenia, and constipation. Two subjects who received 2.5 mg/kg died of sepsis.

We propose computationally efficient methods to incorporate dose-volume constraints (DVCs) into automated IMRT planning.  Methods:   We propose a two-phase approach: in phase-1, we solve a convex approximation with DVCs. Although this convex approximation does not guarantee DVC satisfaction, it provides crucial initial information about voxels likely to receive doses below DVC thresholds. Subsequently, phase-2 solves an optimization problem with maximum dose constraints imposed on those subthreshold voxels. We further categorize DVCs into hard- and soft-DVCs, where hard-DVCs are strictly enforced by the optimization and soft-DVCs are encouraged in the objective function. We tested this approach in our automated treatment planning system which is based on hierarchical constrained optimization. Performance is demonstrated on a series of paraspinal, lung, oligometastasis, and prostate cases as well as a small paraspinal case for which we can computationally afford to obtain a ground-truth by solving a non-convex optimization problem.  Results:   The proposed algorithm successfully meets all the hard-DVCs while increasing the overall computational time of the baseline planning process (without DVCs) by 20%, 10%, and 11% for paraspinal, oligometastasis, and prostate cases, respectively. For a soft-DVC applied to the lung case, the dose-volume histogram curve moves toward the desired direction and the computational time is increased by 11%. For a low-resolution paraspinal case, the ground-truth solution process using mixed-integer programming methods required 15 h while the proposed algorithm converges in only 2 min with a proximal solution.  Conclusions:   A computationally tractable algorithm to handle hard- and soft-DVCs is developed which is capable of satisfying DVCs without any parameter tweaking. Although the algorithm is demonstrated in our in-house developed automated treatment planning system, it can potentially be used in any constrained optimization framework.""","""['Sovanlal Mukherjee', 'Linda Hong', 'Joseph O Deasy', 'Masoud Zarepisheh']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Solving the volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) problem using a sequential convex programming method.', 'An Automatic Approach for Satisfying Dose-Volume Constraints in Linear Fluence Map Optimization for IMPT.', 'Fluence map optimization (FMO) with dose-volume constraints in IMRT using the geometric distance sorting method.', 'Simultaneous beam geometry and intensity map optimization in intensity-modulated radiation therapy.', 'Dose-Volume Constraints fOr oRganS At risk In Radiotherapy (CORSAIR): An ""All-in-One"" Multicenter-Multidisciplinary Practical Summary.', 'Dose Escalation for Pancreas SBRT: Potential and Limitations of using Daily Online Adaptive Radiation Therapy and an Iterative Isotoxicity Automated Planning Approach.', 'Direct incorporation of patient-specific efficacy and toxicity estimates in radiation therapy plan optimization.', 'Automated and Clinically Optimal Treatment Planning for Cancer Radiotherapy.', 'Solving the volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) problem using a sequential convex programming method.', 'Clinical Experience of Automated SBRT Paraspinal and Other Metastatic Tumor Planning With Constrained Hierarchical Optimization.']"""

Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) is an attractive target due to its pronounced overexpression in a variety of tumors, most notably in prostate cancer. Recently, we reported a pyropheophorbide-based PSMA-targeted agent, which exhibited long plasma circulation time and effective tumor accumulation. To further advance PSMA-targeted photodynamic therapy by harvesting tissue-penetrating properties of the NIR light, we developed a bacteriochlorophyll-based PSMA-targeted photosensitizer (BPP), consisting of three building blocks: (1) a PSMA-affinity ligand, (2) a peptide linker to prolong plasma circulation time and (3) a bacteriochlorophyll photosensitizer for NIR fluorescence imaging and photodynamic therapy (Qy absorption maximum at 750 nm). BPP exhibited excellent PSMA-targeting selectivity in both subcutaneous and orthotopic mouse models. The nine D-peptide linker in BPP structure prolonged its plasma circulation time (12.65 h). Favorable pharmacokinetic properties combined with excellent targeting selectivity enabled effective BPP tumor accumulation, which led to effective PDT in a subcutaneous prostate adenocarcinoma mouse model. Overall, bright NIR fluorescence of BPP enables effective image guidance for surgical resection, while the combination of its targeting capabilities and PDT activity allows for potent and precise image-guided photodynamic treatment of PSMA-expressing tumors.""","""['Marta Overchuk', 'Martha P F Damen', 'Kara M Harmatys', 'Martin G Pomper', 'Juan Chen', 'Gang Zheng']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Photochem Photobiol""","""['Theranostic PSMA ligands with optimized backbones for intraoperative multimodal imaging and photodynamic therapy of prostate cancer.', 'Tuning Pharmacokinetics to Improve Tumor Accumulation of a Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen-Targeted Phototheranostic Agent.', 'Development and characterization of a theranostic multimodal anti-PSMA targeting agent for imaging, surgical guidance, and targeted photodynamic therapy of PSMA-expressing tumors.', 'Efficacy Against Human Prostate Cancer by Prostate-specific Membrane Antigen-specific, Transforming Growth Factor-β Insensitive Genetically Targeted CD8+ T-cells Derived from Patients with Metastatic Castrate-resistant Disease.', 'Photodynamic therapy for prostate cancer - A narrative review.', 'Environmentally sensitive photosensitizers enable targeted photodynamic ablation of Gram-positive antibiotic resistant bacteria.', 'Affinity probes based on small-molecule inhibitors for tumor imaging.', 'Photodynamic therapy for prostate cancer: Recent advances, challenges and opportunities.', 'Emerging photodynamic/sonodynamic therapies for urological cancers: progress and challenges.', 'Aggregation-induced emission photosensitizer-based photodynamic therapy in cancer: from chemical to clinical.']"""

Methods:   In total, 4451 men with prostate cancer who presented at the MultiD clinic from 2004 to 2016 were analyzed. To assess nationwide trends, the authors analyzed 392,710 men with prostate cancer who were diagnosed between 2004 and 2015 from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database. The primary endpoint was treatment choice as a function of pretreatment demographics.  Results:   Univariate analyses revealed similar treatment trends in the MultiD and SEER cohorts. The use of procedural forms of definitive therapy decreased with age, including brachytherapy and prostatectomy (all P < .05). Later year of diagnosis/clinic visit was associated with decreased use of definitive treatments, whereas higher risk grouping was associated with increased use (all P < .001). Patients with low-risk disease treated at the MultiD clinic were more likely to receive nondefinitive therapy than patients in SEER, whereas the opposite trend was observed for patients with high-risk disease, with a substantial portion of high-risk patients in SEER not receiving definitive therapy. In the MultiD clinic, African American men with intermediate-risk and high-risk disease were more likely to receive definitive therapy than white men, but for SEER the opposite was true.  Conclusions:   Presentation at a MultiD clinic facilitates the appropriate disposition of patients with low-risk disease to nondefinitive strategies of patients with high-risk disease to definitive treatment, and it may obviate the influence of race.""","""['Chad Tang', 'Karen E Hoffman', 'Pamela K Allen', 'Molly Gabel', 'David Schreiber', 'Seungtaek Choi', 'Brian F Chapin', 'Quynh-Nhu Nguyen', 'John W Davis', 'Paul Corn', 'Christopher Logothetis', 'John Ward', 'Steven J Frank', 'Neema Navai', 'Sean E McGuire', 'Mitchell Anscher', 'Louis Pisters', 'Curtis A Pettaway', 'Rachit Kumar', 'Patrick Linson', 'Prabhakar Tripuraneni', 'Jeffrey J Tomaszewski', 'Ashish B Patel', 'Mark Augspurger', 'Deborah A Kuban']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Cancer""","""['Multidisciplinary clinics: A possible means to help to eliminate racial disparities in prostate cancer.', 'Reply to Multidisciplinary clinics: A possible means to help to eliminate racial disparities in prostate cancer.', 'A population-based analysis of contemporary patterns of care in younger men (<60 years old) with localized prostate cancer.', 'Trends in the treatment of localized prostate cancer using supplemented cancer registry data.', 'Racial treatment trends in localized/regional prostate carcinoma: 1992-1999.', 'Management of localised prostate cancer: watchful waiting, surgery or radiation therapy, depending on the natural course, which is often relatively slow.', 'Prostate cancer research and the National Cancer Institute.', 'Radiation Facility Volume and Survival for Men With Very High-Risk Prostate Cancer Treated with Radiation and Androgen Deprivation Therapy.', 'Tackling Health Care Disparities: How to Build a Sarcoidosis Center.', 'Addressing Challenges and Controversies in the Management of Prostate Cancer with Multidisciplinary Teams.', 'Patient-specific forecasting of postradiotherapy prostate-specific antigen kinetics enables early prediction of biochemical relapse.', 'Multidisciplinary clinics in prostate cancer.']"""

The internet offers a convenient means to deliver health information to patients with prostate cancer. However, there are concerns about the use of the internet among this largely senior population.  Objective:   This study aimed to determine the patterns and factors associated with the use of the internet as a source of health information among Canadian men with prostate cancer and the features and information required in a website.  Methods:   Population surveys were conducted in four Canadian provinces (British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Ontario) in 2014-2015. Data analyses included descriptive, bivariable, and multivariable analyses. The Pearson Chi-square and univariable regression were used to examine associations between independent variables and health-related internet use. Correlates of health-related internet use were analyzed using multivariable logistic regression.  Results:   A total of 1362 patients responded across the four provinces. The mean age of respondents was 69 years (SD 8.2). In addition, 82% (n=1071) were internet users and 71% (n=910) used the internet daily. Further, 65% (n=784) used the internet as a source of prostate cancer information, and 40% (n=521) were confident about using information obtained from the internet to make health decisions. Men who used the internet to obtain prostate cancer information were more likely to be active information seekers (odds ratio [OR]: 4.5, 95% CI 2.6-7.8), be confident using information from the internet to make health decisions (OR: 3.6, 95% CI 2.3-5.7), have broadband internet access (OR: 1.8, 95% CI 1.2-2.7), and have more unmet supportive care needs (OR: 1.05, 95% CI 1.0-1.1). Top features wanted in a website, reported by more than 50% of respondents, were a library of resources (n=893, 65.6%), tools to support treatment decision making (n=815, 59.8%), and tools to help navigate the prostate cancer journey (n=698, 51.2%). Top three topics of information wanted in such a website were treatment options (n=916, 67.3%), disease progression (n=904, 66.4%), and management of side effects (n=858, 63%).  Conclusions:   Over two-thirds of Canadian patients with prostate cancer surveyed use the internet as a source of health information about prostate cancer, but over half did not feel confident using information from the internet to make health decisions. Being an active information seeker, having confidence in using information from the internet to make health decisions, having broadband internet, and having more unmet supportive care needs were significantly associated with health-related internet use.

In this study, we investigate the feasibility of isolating and expanding TIL from primary prostate tumors. We collected tumor specimens from eight patients with diagnosed prostate adenocarcinoma undergoing radical prostatectomy and were able to successfully expand multiple autologous TIL cultures from all patients. Twenty-eight prostate-TIL cultures were further expanded using a standard rapid expansion procedure under Good Manufacturing Practice conditions. TIL cultures were phenotypically characterized for T cell subset composition, differentiation status and co-inhibitory/stimulatory markers such as PD-1, TIM-3, LAG-3, and CD28 and were found to have in general similarity to TIL obtained from patients with melanoma and lung carcinoma previously treated at our center. All analyzed TIL cultures were functional as determined by the capability to produce high level of IFNγ upon stimuli. Most importantly, co-culture assays of prostate-TIL with autologous tumors demonstrated anti-tumor reactivity.

Study design:   Cross-sectional design.  Setting:   Tertiary health facility.  Participants:   Workers at Delta State University Teaching Hospital, Nigeria.  Results:   Females had significantly better knowledge of cervical cancer, p<0.001; their knowledge of the other two cancers studied did not differ significantly from that of males. Staff members with less than 2 years of service, consistently had significantly better knowledge of all 3 cancers than others, p<0.05. Staff with good knowledge of all 3 cancers also decreased significantly with increasing number of years since graduation, p<0.001. Workers in clinical departments generally had better attitude towards screening for all 3 cancers compared to their counterparts in the non-clinical departments, p<0.001. Tertiary education, being in a clinical department, and Christianity were associated with a better attitude and practice of screening. The practice of screening was generally poor, as 54.9% and 89% of females had never screened for breast cancer and cervical cancer respectively; while almost all (93.5%) males 40 years and over had never screened for prostate cancer.  Conclusion:   Overall, knowledge of cancer screening was fair for all cancers; attitude to screening was good towards all cancers.

The microcalcifications may aggregate, passing the resolution threshold to visualize on computed tomography (CT). We evaluated serial NaF positron emission tomography (PET)-CT scans to determine the temporal relationship between vascular NaF uptake and CT evident calcification in the abdominal aorta.  Methods:   Prostate cancer patients who had at least 3 NaF PET-CT scans over at least 1.5 years were retrospectively enrolled. Regions of interest were traced in the abdominal aorta on both PET and CT images, excluding skeletal NaF activity. The maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) of NaF and the density and volume of calcium (exceeding 130 HU) were summed and divided by the number of slices to produce the SUVmax/slice and the mm3·slice-1 of calcium.  Results:   Of 437 patients, 45 patients met criteria. NaF uptake waxed and waned between scans, while the calcium volume plateaued or increased over time. NaF uptake correlated with calcium volume on the baseline scan (P = .60, < .0001†) and calcium volume increment, especially from 1.0 to 1.5 years (r = .79, P < .0001†). Patients with persistently high NaF uptake showed a higher calcium volume increment (0-1.5 years) than patients with low or transiently high NaF uptake.

Objective:   To bring together a large multidisciplinary group of experts to develop consensus statements on controversial topics in bladder cancer management.  Design:   A steering committee compiled proposed statements regarding advanced and variant bladder cancer management which were assessed by 113 experts in a Delphi survey. Statements not reaching consensus were reviewed; those prioritised were revised by a panel of 45 experts before voting during a consensus conference.  Setting:   Online Delphi survey and consensus conference.  Participants:   The European Association of Urology (EAU), the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO), experts in bladder cancer management.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Statements were ranked by experts according to their level of agreement: 1-3 (disagree), 4-6 (equivocal), 7-9 (agree). A priori (level 1) consensus was defined as ≥70% agreement and ≤15% disagreement, or vice versa. In the Delphi survey, a second analysis was restricted to stakeholder group(s) considered to have adequate expertise relating to each statement (to achieve level 2 consensus).  Results and limitations:   Overall, 116 statements were included in the Delphi survey. Of these, 33 (28%) statements achieved level 1 consensus and 49 (42%) statements achieved level 1 or 2 consensus. At the consensus conference, 22 of 27 (81%) statements achieved consensus. These consensus statements provide further guidance across a broad range of topics, including the management of variant histologies, the role/limitations of prognostic biomarkers in clinical decision making, bladder preservation strategies, modern radiotherapy techniques, the management of oligometastatic disease and the evolving role of checkpoint inhibitor therapy in metastatic disease.

Consistent with our clinical observations, BRF1 overexpression in a Pten-deficient mouse (PtenΔ/Δ BRF1Tg) prostate cancer model accelerated prostate carcinogenesis and shortened survival. In PtenΔ/Δ BRF1Tg tumours, immune and inflammatory processes were altered, with reduced tumoral infiltration of neutrophils and CD4 positive T cells, which can be explained by decreased levels of complement factor D (CFD) and C7 components of the complement cascade, an innate immune pathway that influences the adaptive immune response. We tested if the secretome was involved in BRF1-driven tumorigenesis. Unbiased proteomic analysis on BRF1-overexpresing PC3 cells confirmed reduced levels of CFD in the secretome, implicating the complement system in prostate carcinogenesis.

To dissect the molecular cues from cancer cell-microenvironment interaction that drive metastatic cascade, bone metastatic PCa cells were intravenously implanted into zebrafish embryos and mice tibia forming metastatic lesions. Transcriptomic analysis showed an elevated expression of stemness genes, pro-inflammatory cytokines and TGF-β family member Activin A in the cancer cells at metastatic onset in both animal models. Consistently, analysis of clinical datasets revealed that the expression of Activin A is specifically elevated in metastases and correlates with poor prognosis in stratified high-risk PCa patients. It is further unveiled that the microenvironment induced Activin A expression by NF-κB activation. The elevated level of Activin A enhanced the invasive ALDHhi CSC-like phenotypes and PCa proliferation by activation of Smad and ERK1/2 signaling driving metastasis. Suppression of Activin A or Activin receptor significantly reduced the CSC-like subpopulation, invasion, metastatic growth, and bone lesion formation in zebrafish and mice xenografts, suggesting a functional role of NF-κB-dependent Activin A in PCa metastasis. Overall, our study demonstrates that human PCa cells can display a comparable response with the microenvironment in zebrafish and mice xenografts.

We analyzed cancer-incidence trends, reported as annual percent change (APC) for each 10-year group from age 20 to 89 years. We also estimated age-adjusted incidence rate ratios from fitted birth cohort models.  Results:   Across most age categories, the most recent trends show significant decreases in the incidence of cervical (APC -8.8% to -0.33%), lung (men: -7.42% to -0.36%; women: -6.27% to 1.07%), bladder (women: -4.12% to -0.07%; men: -5.13% to -0.38%) and prostate cancer (-11.11% to -1.11%). Significant increasing trends were observed for kidney, thyroid and uterine cancers. Overall incidence has increased among both sexes younger than 50 years of age, with recent increases in pancreatic cancer among men, breast cancer among women and colorectal cancer among both sexes. From the birth cohort analysis, we observed increasing trends in colorectal, liver and prostate cancers among men; kidney cancer and melanoma among women; and thyroid cancer among both sexes. We observed decreasing trends in cervical and ovarian cancers, and in bladder and lung cancers among men.

Most research focuses on accident and emergency (A&E) and does not consider GP out-of-hours (GPOOH).  Aim:   To describe the frequency and patterns of unscheduled care use by people with cancer in their last year of life and to examine the associations of demographic and clinical factors with unscheduled care attendance.  Design and setting:   Retrospective cohort study of all 2443 people who died from cancer in Tayside, Scotland, during 2012-2015. Clinical population datasets were linked to routinely collected clinical data using the Community Health Index (CHI) number.  Method:   Anonymised CHI-linked data were analysed in SafeHaven, with descriptive analysis, using binary logistic regression for adjusted associations.  Results:   Of the people who died from cancer, 77.9% (n = 1904) attended unscheduled care in the year before death. Among unscheduled care users, most only attended GPOOH (n = 1070, 56.2%), with the rest attending A&E only (n = 204, 10.7%), or both (n = 630, 33.1%). Many attendances occurred in the last week (n =1360, 19.7%), last 4 weeks (n = 2541, 36.7%), and last 12 weeks (n = 4174, 60.3%) of life. Age, sex, deprivation, and cancer type were not significantly associated with unscheduled care attendance. People living in rural areas were less likely to attend unscheduled care: adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 0.64 (95% confidence interval = 0.50 to 0.82). Pain was the commonest coded clinical reason for presenting (GPOOH: n = 482, 10.5%; A&E: n = 336, 28.8%). Of people dying from cancer, n = 514, 21.0%, were frequent users (≥5 attendances/year), and accounted for over half (n = 3986, 57.7%) of unscheduled care attendances.

Here, in vivo characterization of tumor-associated USP22 upregulation and unbiased interrogation of USP22-regulated functions in vitro demonstrated critical roles for USP22 in prostate cancer. Specifically, clinical datasets validated that USP22 expression is elevated in prostate cancer, and a novel murine model demonstrated a hyperproliferative phenotype with prostate-specific USP22 overexpression. Accordingly, upon overexpression or depletion of USP22, enrichment of cell-cycle and DNA repair pathways was observed in the USP22-sensitive transcriptome and ubiquitylome using prostate cancer models of clinical relevance. Depletion of USP22 sensitized cells to genotoxic insult, and the role of USP22 in response to genotoxic insult was further confirmed using mouse adult fibroblasts from the novel murine model of USP22 expression. As it was hypothesized that USP22 deubiquitylates target substrates to promote protumorigenic phenotypes, analysis of the USP22-sensitive ubiquitylome identified the nucleotide excision repair protein, XPC, as a critical mediator of the USP22-mediated response to genotoxic insult. Thus, XPC undergoes deubiquitylation as a result of USP22 function and promotes USP22-mediated survival to DNA damage.

Individual surgeon use of PLND is not well-known. We sought to examine variability in PLND performance and detection of LN+ across the Michigan Urological Surgery Improvement Collaborative.  Methods:   Data regarding all RARP (3/2012-9/2018) were prospectively collected, including patient and surgeon characteristics. Univariable and multivariable analyses of PLND rate and LN+ rate were performed.  Results:   Among 9,751 men undergoing RARP, 79.8% had PLND performed (n = 7,781), of which 5.2% were LN+ (n = 404). In univariate and multivariable analyses, predictors of PLND included higher Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA), biopsy Gleason grade (bGG), number of positive cores, and maximum core involvement at P < 0.05 for each. Higher PSA, cT stage, bGG, number of positive cores, and maximum core involvement predicted LN+ when PLND was performed (P < 0.05 for each). There was significant surgeon variation in the proportion of PLND performed at RARP, yet neither surgeon-annualized RARP volume nor % of PLND performed was associated with LN+ disease (P > 0.05). Grade was associated with PLND (60.0%, 77.6%, 91.0%, 97.3%, and 98.5%; P < 0.001) and LN+ (0.7%, 2.5%, 5.8%, 8.6%, and 19.9%; P < 0.001) for bGG 1,2,3,4,5, respectively. Maximum core involvement also strongly predicted LN+ with rates of 1.5%, 3.8%, and 9.4% for <35%, 35% to 65%, and >65%, respectively (P < 0.001).  Conclusions:   Nearly 80% of RARP in Michigan Urological Surgery Improvement Collaborative were performed with PLND, including 60% of bGG1 patients (with LN+ in only 0.7%), but significant variability exists between surgeons.

Methods:   The results of the present study are based on data from the study ""Early rehabilitation of cancer patients."" Two hundred and forty patients (109 females) with one of the following cancer types were included: breast, colorectal, prostate and testicular cancer, and lymphoma. Chalder's fatigue questionnaire (FQ) was used to map CRF at baseline, 4, 8, 12, and 24 months post-inclusion. Baseline was at the time of diagnosis, before treatment start. Physical activity was recorded using SenseWear armband (SWA) at baseline, 4 and 24 months post-inclusion.  Results:   One hour increased MVPA daily at baseline was associated with lower fatigue with - 0.8 at 4 months' follow-up (p < 0.001), - 0.7 at 8 months' follow-up (p = 0.001), - 0.6 at 12 months' follow-up (p = 0.008), and - 0.5 at 24 months' follow-up (p < 0.043).

We hypothesized that increased rates of hospice use would reduce or eliminate insurance plan-based disparities and that racial/ethnic disparities would be eliminated in managed care (MC) insurance plans.  Methods:   We studied the use of hospice care in the final 30 days of life among 40,184 elderly Texas Medicare beneficiaries who died from primary breast, colorectal, lung, pancreas, or prostate cancer between January 1, 2007 and December 31, 2013, using statewide Medicare claims linked to cancer registry data. Rates of hospice use were computed by race/ethnicity and insurance plan (MC or fee-for-service (FFS)). We used logistic regression to account for the impact of confounding factors.  Results:   Rates of hospice use increased significantly over time, from 68.9% in 2007 to 76.1% in 2013. By 2013, differences in hospice use rates between MC and FFS plans had been reduced from 10% to < 5%. However, after accounting for insurance plan and confounding factors, racial/ethnic minority beneficiaries' hospice use was significantly lower than non-Hispanic white beneficiaries' (p < 0.0001). This disparity was observed among both FFS and MC beneficiaries.  Conclusions:   Hospice use in the final 30 days of life has increased among elderly cancer patients in Texas, virtually eliminating the difference between FFS and MC insurance plans.

Our objective was to evaluate the association between vasectomy and PCa from a nationwide cohort in Finland.  Materials & methods:   Sterilization registry of Finland and the Finnish Cancer Registry data were utilized to identify all men who underwent vasectomy between years 1987-2014 in Finland. Standard incidence ratio (SIR) for PCa as well as all-cause standardized mortality ratios (SMR) were calculated.  Results:   We identified 38,124 men with vasectomy with a total of 429,937 person-years follow-up data. The median age at vasectomy was 39.7 years (interquartile range [IQR] 35.9-44.0), after vasectomy PCa was diagnosed in 413 men (122 cases 0-10 years, 219 cases 10-20 years and 72 cases >20 years from vasectomy). SIR for PCa for the vasectomy cohort was 1.15 (95% CI: 1.04-1.27). By the end of follow-up, 19 men had died from PCa, while the expected number was 20.5 (SMR 0.93 [95%CI: 0.56-1.44]). The overall mortality was decreased (SMR 0.54 [95%CI: 0.51-0.58]) among men with vasectomy.  Conclusion:   We found a small statistically significant increase in PCa incidence after vasectomy, but in contrast the mortality of vasectomized men was significantly reduced. This may be due to higher likelihood of vasectomized men to undergo prostate-specific antigen testing, having healthier general lifestyle and other biological factors e.g. high reproductive fitness.""","""['Heikki Seikkula', 'Antti Kaipia', 'Elli Hirvonen', 'Matti Rantanen', 'Janne Pitkäniemi', 'Nea Malila', 'Peter J Boström']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Cancer Epidemiol""","""['Vasectomy and prostate cancer: a case-control study in India.', 'Vasectomy and Prostate Cancer Risk: A 38-Year Nationwide Cohort Study.', 'Vasectomy and prostate cancer in US blacks and whites.', 'Vasectomy and risk of prostate cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis of cohort studies.', 'Male sterilization.', 'Vasectomy and Risk of Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.', 'Association between vasectomy and risk of prostate cancer: a meta-analysis.', 'Review of Vasectomy Complications and Safety Concerns.']"""

Results:   There was a more than10-point decrease in mean scores across all symptom domains at 1-year follow-up. Thereafter mean scores for all symptom domains improved marginally and remained relatively unchanged at 3-year follow-up. Prostatectomy had the greatest negative effect on sexual function and urinary incontinence. Overall quality of life was most adversely affected by sexual function, regardless of treatment modality.

Thus, the aim of this study was to determine whether 20-HETE can affect the metastatic potential of androgen-insensitive prostate cancer cells, and the implication of the newly described 20-HETE receptor, GPR75, in mediating these effects.  Methods:   The expression of GPR75, protein phosphorylation, actin polymerization and protein distribution were assessed by western blot and/or fluorescence microscopy. Additionally, in vitro assays including epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) activity, scratch wound healing, transwell invasion and soft agar colony formation were used to evaluate the effects of 20-HETE agonists/antagonists or GPR75 gene silencing on the aggressive features of PC-3 cells.  Results:   20-HETE (0.1 nM) promoted the acquisition of a mesenchymal phenotype by increasing EMT, the release of MMP-2, cell migration and invasion, actin stress fiber formation and anchorage-independent growth. Also, 20-HETE augmented the expression of HIC-5, the phosphorylation of EGFR, NF-κB, AKT and p-38 and the intracellular redistribution of p-AKT and PKCα. These effects were impaired by GPR75 antagonism and/or silencing. Accordingly, the inhibition of 20-HETE formation with N-hydroxy-N'-(4-n-butyl-2-methylphenyl) formamidine (HET0016) elicited the opposite effects.  Conclusions:   The present results show for the first time the involvement of the 20-HETE-GPR75 receptor in the activation of intracellular signaling known to be stimulated in cell malignant transformations leading to the differentiation of PC-3 cells towards a more aggressive phenotype.

Both of 1 and 2 showed broad-spectrum anti-cancer activities in vitro, for example, 1 and 2 showed inhibitory activity IC50 = 21.1 μM and 17.2 μM for DU145, human prostate cancer cells, respectively, and IC50 = 18.5 μM and 10.5 μM for T24 cells, human bladder cancer cells. In this study, we estimated anticancer effects of 2 in a bladder cancer model after intravesical administration similar to clinical cases. A single intravesical administration of 2 exhibited the most potent inhibitory activities among the clinical drugs for bladder cancers, BCG and Pirarubicin, without obvious side effects and toxicity (Fig. 4).

Method:   Various in-vitro parameters to determine cytotoxic and apoptotic potential of RITA with genotoxic drug cisplatin were evaluated. The potentiation of cytotoxic effect was evaluated using MTT assay and colony forming assay, mechanism of cell death by Etbr/AcO assay and the mechanism of apoptosis was determined by caspase-3 release assay.  Results:   The findings from MTT confirmed the best possible potent combination of 5+5µM and 10+10µM concentration of Cisplatin and RITA respectively. These combinations were further evaluated for its chemo sensitizing effect which confirmed the significant reduction in number of colonies in combination as compared to monotherapy. Also, the results of Etbr/AcO assay were in line with the colony forming assay. For apoptotic activity, it was noted that increasing the concentration of cisplatin and RITA (10µM), did not affect much to apoptotic activity and was found to be equally effective to that of low dose (5µM) concentration. The same results were seen in Caspase-3 release effect on both the cell lines.  Conclusion:   Our present study provides compelling evidence that pharmacological activation of the p53 by blocking the MDM2-p53 interaction is a promising cancer therapeutic strategy and using RITA in combination with Cisplatin not only decrease the toxic effect of Cisplatin by decreasing its dose but also increasing the apoptotic effect, warrants clinical evaluation on both colon and prostate cancer.""","""['Amit Gupta', 'Tapan Behl', 'Hem Raj Heer', 'Rahul Deshmukh', 'Pyare Lal Sharma']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Asian Pac J Cancer Prev""","""['The p53-reactivating small-molecule RITA enhances cisplatin-induced cytotoxicity and apoptosis in head and neck cancer.', 'Bibenzyl analogue DS-1 inhibits MDM2-mediated p53 degradation and sensitizes apoptosis in lung cancer cells.', 'MDM2 Inhibition Sensitizes Prostate Cancer Cells to Androgen Ablation and Radiotherapy in a p53-Dependent Manner.', 'Targeting MDM2-p53 interaction for cancer therapy: are we there yet?', 'MDM2-p53 Interaction Inhibitors: The Current State-of-Art and Updated Patent Review (2010-Present).', 'P53/MDM2 Complex-Based Targeted Strategies in Colon Adenocarcinoma.', 'RITA selectively inhibits proliferation of BAP1-deficient cutaneous melanoma cells in vitro.', 'Fibronectin Modulates the Expression of miRNAs in Prostate Cancer Cell Lines.', 'Targeting autophagy in prostate cancer: preclinical and clinical evidence for therapeutic response.', 'Microarray analysis of differentially expressed long non-coding RNAs in daidzein-treated lung cancer cells.']"""

KAI-1/CD82 is an important member of MSGs; the role of KAI1 has been well explored in prostate cancer, however its role in breast cancer is not fully explored and in fact the results of breast cancer studies are contentious. Thus, the present study aimed to investigate expression of KAI1 at both transcriptional and translational levels in the tissue of breast cancer patients and benign breast disease. Further, we analysed the relationship between expression levels of KAI1 and clinicopathological parameters in breast cancer patients.  Materials and methods:   mRNA expression was studied by Real time PCR and protein expression was analyzed by both Western blot and Immunohistochemistry.  Results:   The results of the study indicate that KAI1 expression was remarkably decreased in breast cancer both at the gene and the protein levels (P < 0.05) compared to benign breast disease. In addition, KAI1 expression levels were strongly associated with axillary lymph node status and advanced T stage (p < 0.05), however no association was found with tumor grade, age, menopausal status and receptor status like ER, PR and Her2.

Our purpose was, therefore, to generate a plan library for use in adaptive IMPT to mitigate these uncertainties.  Methods and materials:   We retrospectively included 27 patients with a series of computed tomography scans throughout their treatment representing day-to-day variation. In 18 of the patients, target motion was analyzed using rigid shifts of prostate gold markers relative to bony anatomy. A plan library with different p and sv planning target volume (p/sv-PTV) positions was defined from the distribution and direction of these shifts. Delivery of IMPT using plan selection from the library was simulated for image guidance on bony anatomy, in the remaining patients and compared with nonadaptive IMPT.  Results:   The plan library consisted of 3 small margin p/sv-PTVs: (1) p/sv-PTV shifted 1.5 systematic error (Σ) of the population mean in the anterior and cranial directions, (2) p/sv-PTV shifted 1.5Σ in the posterior and caudal directions, and (3) p/sv-PTV in the planning position. The conventional p/sv-PTV was also available for backup. Plan selection compared with nonadaptive IMPT resulted in a reduction of the rectum volume receiving 60 Gy relative biological effect (RBE) (V60GyRBE) from on average 12 mL to 9 mL. For the bladder the average V45GyRBE was reduced from 36% to 30%. Large and small bowel doses were also reduced, whereas target coverage was comparable or improved compared with nonadaptive IMPT.  Conclusions:   Plan selection based on a population model of rigid target motion was feasible for all patients.

Methods:   The metabolic profiles of matched tissue, serum and urine samples from the same patients were analyzed using a 1H NMR-based metabolomics approach. We identified several important metabolites that significantly altered at different stages of PCa, including benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), early PCa (EPC), advanced PCa (APC), metastatic PCa (MPC) and castration-resistant PCa (CRPC). Metabolic correlation networks among tissue, serum and urine samples were examined using Pearson's correlation.  Results:   The changes in metabolic phenotypes during the progression of PCa were more noticeable in tissue samples when compared with serum and urine samples. Herein we identified a series of important metabolic disturbances, including decreased trends of citrate, creatinine, acetate, leucine, valine, glycine, lysine, histidine, glutamine and choline as well as increased trends of uridine and formate. These metabolites are mainly implicated in energy metabolism, amino acid metabolism, choline and fatty acid metabolism as well as uridine metabolism. We also found that energy metabolism in tumor tissues was positively associated with amino acid metabolism in serum and urine.

Results:   We evaluated 415 patients aged 41-99 (68.25 ± 9.59). Of these patients, 344 (82.9 %) had at least one localized lesion. The detection rates were 48.3 %, 52.6 %, 74.4 %, 79.6 %, and 93.9 % for a PSA value of < 0.2 ng/ml, ≥ 0.2-< 0.5 ng/ml, ≥ 0.5-< 1 ng/ml, ≥ 1-< 2 ng/ml, and ≥ 2 ng/ml, respectively (p < 0.05). The detection rates increased significantly with higher GSs; the rates were 68.3 % (28/41), 74.5 % (73/98), 93.9 % (46/49), and 91 % (61/67) for a GS of < 7, 7, 8, and > 8, respectively (p < 0.05). An ideal cut-off value of > 1.16 ng/ml was obtained for PSA value, which equates to specificity of 75 % and sensitivity of 77 %. In comparing BSs and PET/CT, a region-based analysis showed the superiority of PET/CT over BSs for all regions expect the skull (p < 0.05). PET/CT detected 258 suspicious regions, 255 of which were metastatic and three of which were equivocal. BSs detected only 223 suspicious regions, 203 of which were metastatic and 20 of which were equivocal.  Conclusions:   [68Ga]PSMA PET/CT showed a high detection rate for lesions in PC patients. PSA level, GS, and a PSA doubling time of less than 6 months were shown to be the affective variables. In addition, 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT showed better performance in detecting bone lesions than BSs.""","""['Habibollah Dadgar', 'Farshad Emami', 'Nasim Norouzbeigi', 'Manouchehr Seyedi Vafaee', 'Esmail Jafari', 'Ali Gholamrezanezhad', 'Majid Assadi', 'Hojjat Ahmadzadehfar']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Mol Imaging Biol""","""['More advantages in detecting bone and soft tissue metastases from prostate cancer using 18F-PSMA PET/CT.', '68Ga-Labeled Prostate-specific Membrane Antigen Ligand Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography for Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.', '68GaPSMA PET/CT Improves Initial Staging and Management Plan of Patients with High-Risk Prostate Cancer.', 'Use of gallium-68 prostate-specific membrane antigen positron-emission tomography for detecting lymph node metastases in primary and recurrent prostate cancer and location of recurrence after radical prostatectomy: an overview of the current literature.', 'Detection rates of recurrent prostate cancer: 68Gallium (Ga)-labelled prostate-specific membrane antigen versus choline PET/CT scans.

This study has a methodological aim: to identify a more robust SUV-based index representing the tracer accumulation. In particular, the new metric was tested to confirm the potential of mannitol to reduce renal uptake Ga-68 prostate-specific membrane antigen ([68Ga]PSMA).  Procedures:   To this aim, our previously published work, proving the efficacy of mannitol, was considered as a background study. Renal SUVmax was calculated in nine patients undergoing [68Ga]PSMA positron emission tomography (PET)/X-ray computed tomography (CT) at baseline (b-PET/CT) and at follow-up after intravenous infusion of 500 ml of 10 % mannitol (m-PET/CT). SUV values of kidney volumes were extracted by a new 3D segmentation method. A new parameter, the median computed on the upper 10% of the SUV distribution (SUV95th), was introduced to better characterize the tracer accumulation. A comparison between SUVmax and SUV95th was also performed. Kruskal-Wallis test was used to assess the statistical significance of the differences in SUV95th between b-PET/CT and m-PET/CT.  Results:   SUV95th not only confirmed the efficacy of mannitol as demonstrated in the previous study but improved the separability of b-PET/CT and m-PET/CT examinations, overturning SUVmax findings in two cases. The outcomes of the Kruskal-Wallis test computed for each kidney proved that differences between b-PET/CT and m-PET/CT SUV95th values were significant (p value < 0.001).  Conclusions:   Our findings indicate that SUV95th is a more robust index to assess high uptake level, representing a reliable alternative to SUVmax. Independently from the segmentation method, the superiority of SUV95th and its easy computation could make its clinical impact decisive. The results obtained with SUV95th, more representative of tracer uptake than those with SUVmax suggest, in our opinion, that mannitol infusion could be used to reduce the adsorbed dose to the kidneys during [68Ga]PSMA PET/CT and Lu-177 or Ac-225 therapy. Our future goal will be confirming this effect in a larger cohort of patients, also verifying the role of SUV95th in the evaluation of tumor response to therapy.""","""['Serena Baiocco', 'Federica Matteucci', 'Emilio Mezzenga', 'Paola Caroli', 'Valentina Di Iorio', 'Corrado Cittanti', 'Alessandro Bevilacqua', 'Giovanni Paganelli', 'Anna Sarnelli']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Mol Imaging Biol""","""['More advantages in detecting bone and soft tissue metastases from prostate cancer using 18F-PSMA PET/CT.', 'Reduction of 68Ga-PSMA renal uptake with mannitol infusion: preliminary results.', 'Biodistribution of (68)GaPSMA-HBED-CC in Patients with Prostate Cancer: Characterization of Uptake in Normal Organs and Tumour Lesions.', 'Can SUVmax of 68Ga-labeled PSMA Ligand and 18F-choline PET/CT Be Used to Predict the Radiation Dose in Prostate Cancer Patients?', 'Pilot study comparing dominant intraprostatic lesion volume using Ga-68 prostate-specific membrane antigen PET-computed tomography and multiparametric MRI.', 'Quantitative Evaluation of a Multimodal Aptamer-Targeted Long-Circulating Polymer for Tumor Targeting.', 'Image intensity histograms as imaging biomarkers: application to immune-related colitis.', ""Exploratory Analysis of 18F-3'-deoxy-3'-fluorothymidine (18F-FLT) PET/CT-Based Radiomics for the Early Evaluation of Response to Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy in Patients With Locally Advanced Breast Cancer."", 'A 68GaGa-DOTANOC PET/CT Radiomic Model for Non-Invasive Prediction of Tumour Grade in Pancreatic Neuroendocrine Tumours.']"""

The aim was to study the effects of a nutrition intervention on bowel symptoms and health-related quality of life, compared with standard care.  Methods:   Patients were randomised to a nutrition intervention (n = 92) aiming to replace insoluble fibres with soluble and reduce intake of lactose, or a standard care group (n = 88) who were recommended to maintain their habitual diet. Bowel symptoms, health-related quality of life and intake of fibre and lactose-containing foods were assessed up to 24 months after radiotherapy completion. Multiple linear regression was used to analyse the effects of the nutrition intervention on bowel symptoms during the acute (up to 2 months post radiotherapy) and the late (7 to 24 months post radiotherapy) phase.  Results:   Most symptoms and functioning worsened during the acute phase, and improved during the late phase in both the intervention and standard care groups. The nutrition intervention was associated with less blood in stools (p = 0.047), flatulence (p = 0.014) and increased loss of appetite (p = 0.018) during the acute phase, and more bloated abdomen in the late phase (p = 0.029). However, these associations were clinically trivial or small.

Single-agent PSMA-targeted radioligand therapy (PRLT) with the alpha-emitter 225Ac showed promise against mCRPC but may cause severe and/or persistent xerostomia, which may substantially impair patients' quality-of-life. We hypothesized that when 177Lu-PSMA ligand alone is ineffective, tandem therapy with low-activity 225Ac-PSMA ligand plus full activity of the beta emitter may enhance efficacy while minimizing xerostomia severity.  Methods:   We retrospectively analyzed pilot experience with 1 course of 225Ac-PSMA-617/177Lu-PSMA-617 tandem therapy in our first 20 patients with mCRPC receiving this intervention after insufficiently responding to 177Lu-PSMA-617 monotherapy.

Significant responders to tandem therapy received 177Lu-PSMA-617 monotherapy as maintenance (median [minimum-maximum]: 1 [0-5] cycle). After a median (minimum-maximum) 22 (14-63) weeks' follow-up, 13/20 patients (65%) had as best biochemical response a PSA decline > 50%. Median (95% confidence interval) progression-free survival was 19 (12-26) weeks, and overall survival was 48 (4-92) weeks post-tandem therapy administration.

Imaging parameters, including average apparent diffusion coefficient and SUVmax, were derived. Immunohistochemical staining was performed to evaluate the PTEN status. The diagnostic performance of imaging parameters was analyzed by receiver-operating-characteristic analysis. Univariate logistic regression analyses were used to evaluate the association between clinical and imaging variables and PTEN status. Results: In total, 103 lesions from 75 patients were analyzed.

Limited research exists on the value of such signatures in African American men (AAM), who have poor prostate cancer outcomes. We explored differences in gene expression between EAM and AAM for three commercially available panels recommended by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network for prostate cancer prognosis.  Methods:   A total of 232 EAM and 95 AAM patients provided radical prostatectomy specimens. Gene expression was quantified using NanoString for 60 genes spanning the Oncotype DX Prostate, Prolaris, and Decipher panels. A continuous expression-based risk score was approximated for each. Differential expression, intrapanel coexpression, and risk by race were assessed.  Results:   Clinical and pathologic features were similar between AAM and EAM. Differential expression by race was observed for 48% of genes measured, although the magnitudes of expression differences were small. Coexpression patterns were more strongly preserved by race group for Oncotype DX and Decipher than Prolaris. Poorer prognosis was estimated in EAM versus AAM for Oncotype DX (P < 0.001), whereas negligible prognostic differences were predicted between AAM and EAM using Prolaris or Decipher (P > 0.05).  Conclusions:   Because of observed racial differences across three commercial gene expression panels for prostate cancer prognosis, caution is warranted when applying these panels in clinical decision-making in AAM.

Expression of endogenous TOPK was promoted by TGF-β1 treatment of MDA-MB-231 cells time-dependently. In addition, knockdown of TOPK attenuated TGF-β1-induced phosphorylation or transcriptional activity of Smad3. Meanwhile, levels of both mRNA and protein of TBX3 induced by TGF-β1 were abolished by TOPK depletion. Also, knockdown of TBX3 inhibited TGF-β1 induction of EMT-related genes Snail, Slug or Fibronectin. Furthermore, ablation of TOPK or TBX3 suppressed TGF-β1-induced MDA-MB-231 cell invasion.

Upregulation of expression for base excision repair (BER) related genes is associated with poor patient survival. Thus, inhibition of the BER pathway may prove to be an effective therapy for prostate cancer. Using a high throughput BER capacity screening assay, we sought to identify BER inhibitors that can synergize with castration therapy. An FDA-approved drug library was screened to identify inhibitors of BER using a fluorescence-based assay suitable for HTS. A gel-based secondary assay confirmed the reduction of BER capacity by compounds identified in the primary screen. Five compounds were then selected for further testing in the independently derived, androgen-dependent prostate cancer cell lines, LNCaP and LAPC4, and in the nonmalignant prostate derived cell lines PNT1A and RWPE1. Further analysis led to the identification of a lead compound, natamycin, as an effective inhibitor of key BER enzymes DNA polymerase β (pol β) and DNA Ligase I (LIG I).

A total of 292 miRNAs were differentially expressed with 125 upregulated and 167 downregulated.

Materials and methods:   Patients with an Office of Population Census and Surveys Classification of Interventions and Procedures, version 4 code for an artificial urinary sphincter (AUS) or male sling between 1 January 2010 and 31 March 2018 were searched for within the Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) dataset. Those without previous RP were excluded. Multivariable logistic regressions for repeat AUS and sling procedures were built in stata. Further descriptive analysis of provision of procedures was performed.  Results:   A total of 1414 patients had received index AUS, 10.3% of whom had undergone prior radiotherapy; their median follow-up was 3.55 years. The sling cohort contained 816 patients; 6.7% of these had received prior radiotherapy and the median follow-up was 3.23 years. Whilst the number of AUS devices implanted had increased each year, male slings peaked in 2014/2015. AUS redo/removal was performed in 11.2% of patients. Patients in low-volume centres were more likely to require redo/removal (odds ratio [OR] 2.23 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.02-4.86; P = 0.045). A total of 12.0% patients with a sling progressed to AUS implantation and 1.3% had a second sling. Patients with previous radiotherapy were more likely to require a second operation (OR 2.03 95% CI 1.01-4.06; P = 0.046). Emergency re-admissions within 30 days of index operation were 3.9% and 3.6% fewer in high-volume centres, for AUS and slings respectively. The median time to initial continence surgery from RP was 2.8 years. Increased time from RP conferred no reduced risk of redo surgery for either procedure.  Conclusion:   There is a volume effect for outcomes of AUS procedures, suggesting that they should only be performed in high-volume centres. Given the known impact of incontinence on quality of life, patients should be referred sooner for post-prostatectomy continence surgery.""","""['Amandeep Dosanjh', 'Simon Baldwin', 'Jemma Mytton', 'Dominic King', 'Nigel Trudgill', 'Mohammed Belal', 'Prashant Patel']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""BJU Int""","""['A contemporary view on the use of slings and artificial urinary sphincters for the treatment of post-prostatectomy incontinence in England.', 'What if artificial urinary sphincter is not possible?

The emergence of point mutation in the Ligand Binding Domain (LBD) of AR has resulted in the development of resistance against AR antagonist. The point mutation T877A, W741L and F876L confer resistance to flutamide, bicalutamide and enzalutamide respectively. There is no AR antagonist in the present clinical set up without resistance. Hence, our aim in this study is to design a novel molecule to overcome the resistance caused by point mutation.  Methods:   Here, we developed novel AR antagonist bearing (5-methyl-1H-pyrazol-3-yl)-1, 3,4-oxadiazole core by rational drug design. The test molecules 8a-h were synthesized from the corresponding dihydrazide compounds 7a-h on treatment with phosphorous oxychloride on reflux conditions. The structure of the molecules was confirmed from spectral data such as IR, 1H-NMR, HRMS and 13C-NMR. The synthesized compounds were screened for cytotoxicity in prostate cancer cell lines LNCaP-FGC and PC3. The confirmation of AR mediated activity of the test compounds was confirmed by gene expression study. The interaction of the best active ligands with mutant AR was predicted and drug design was rationalized through docking studies.  Results:   The test compounds 8a-h were synthesized and the structures were conformed using suitable techniques like IR, 1H-NMR, HRMS and 13C-NMR. Among the tested compounds, 8b and 8d showed potent antiproliferative activity against mutant AR cell lines. Further, these compounds significantly decreased the gene expression of prostate cancer biomarkers.  Conclusion:   In this study, we have identified a potential hit molecule for AR antagonism that could be further developed to obtain a potent clinical candidate.""","""['Sasikumar Andavar', 'Mohanasrinivasan Vaithilingam', 'Divakar Selvaraj', 'Ajeeshkumar A Kumaran', 'Krishnaswamy Devanathan']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Anticancer Agents Med Chem""","""['Discovery and biological evaluation of novel androgen receptor antagonist for castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Synthesis, biological evaluation and molecular docking of 4-Amino-2H-benzohchromen-2-one (ABO) analogs containing the piperazine moiety.', 'Iminoenamine based novel androgen receptor antagonist exhibited anti-prostate cancer activity in androgen independent prostate cancer cells through inhibition of AKT pathway.', 'A critical update on the strategies towards modulators targeting androgen receptors.', '1,3,4-Oxadiazoles as Potential Pharmacophore for Cytotoxic Potentiality: A Comprehensive Review.']"""

Methods:   Retrospective cross-sectional study at Kaiser Permanente Southern California (KPSC) evaluating HCV and non-HCV patients from 1 January 2008 to 12 December 2012. Cancer diagnoses were obtained from the KPSC-SEER-affiliated registry. Logistic regression analyses were used for rate ratios and time-to-event analyses were performed using Cox proportional hazards models, adjusted for age, gender, race, smoking and cirrhosis. Cancer rate ratios were stratified by tobacco, alcohol abuse, diabetes and body mass index (BMI).  Results:   The initial population and final population of multivariable analysis were N = 5 332 903 and N = 2 080 335 respectively. Cancer burden (all sites) was significantly higher in HCV than in non-HCV patients and HCV patients had a high rate of liver cancer. When liver cancer was excluded, cancer rates remained significantly increased in HCV. Unadjusted cancer rates were significantly higher in HCV compared to non-HCV for oesophageal, stomach, colorectal, pancreas, myeloma, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, head/neck, lung, renal and prostate cancer. After stratification for alcohol abuse, tobacco, diabetes and BMI, increased cancer rates remained significant for all cancer sites, liver cancer and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Multivariable analyses demonstrated a strong correlation between cirrhosis and cancer. Tobacco use and diabetes were also associated with cancer. In the absence of cirrhosis, HCV, tobacco use and diabetes significantly increased the cancer risk. Mediation analyses showed that cirrhosis was responsible for a large proportion on the effect of HCV on cancer risk.  Conclusion:   This study supports the concept of HCV as a systemic illness and treating HCV regardless of disease severity and prior to progression to cirrhosis.""","""['Anders H Nyberg', 'Ekaterina Sadikova', 'Craig Cheetham', 'Kevin M Chiang', 'Jiaxiao X Shi', 'Susan Caparosa', 'Zobair M Younossi', 'Lisa M Nyberg']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Liver Int""","""['Diabetes Mellitus Heightens the Risk of Hepatocellular Carcinoma Except in Patients With Hepatitis C Cirrhosis.', 'HCV genotype 3 is associated with an increased risk of cirrhosis and hepatocellular cancer in a national sample of U.S. Veterans with HCV.', 'Declining hepatitis C virus-related liver disease burden in the direct-acting antiviral therapy era in New South Wales, Australia.', 'The risk of end stage liver disease and hepatocellular carcinoma among persons infected with hepatitis C virus: publication bias?', 'Hepatitis C virus (HCV) disease progression in people who inject drugs (PWID): A systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Chronic hepatitis C infection is associated with higher incidence of extrahepatic cancers in a Canadian population based cohort.', 'Differential role of chronic liver diseases on the incidence of cancer: a longitudinal analysis among 248,224 outpatients in Germany.', 'Association between viral infection other than human papillomavirus and risk of esophageal carcinoma: a comprehensive meta-analysis of epidemiological studies.', 'Chronic Hepatitis Virus Infection Are Associated With High Risk of Gastric Cancer: A Systematic Review and Cumulative Analysis.', 'The association between hepatitis C virus infection and renal cell cancer, prostate cancer, and bladder cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis.']"""

We aimed to investigate whether diagnosis with these conditions was associated with subsequent prostate cancer diagnosis and mortality. We used linked English national Hospital Episode Statistics and mortality data from 1999 to 2017 to construct and follow-up cohorts of men aged ≥35 years diagnosed with (i) acromegaly (n = 2,495) and (ii) hypogonadal-associated diseases (n = 18,763): Klinefelter's syndrome (n = 1,992), testicular hypofunction (n = 8,086) and hypopituitarism (n = 10,331).

Due to significant improvement in overall survival after the first interim analysis, patients in the placebos + ADT arm could switch to AA + P + ADT during an open-label extension. As in other studies where switching is allowed, statistical adjustments are needed to assess the real benefit of new drugs.  Patients and methods:   This was a post hoc analysis to estimate the true survival benefit of AA + P + ADT in patients with newly diagnosed mCSPC by applying statistical adjustments commonly used to adjust for treatment switching.  Results:   Of 112 patients still receiving placebos + ADT at the first interim analysis, 72 switched to AA + P + ADT during the open-label extension. Final analysis was conducted after median follow-up of 51.8 months.

MATERIAL AND METHODS This retrospective study enrolled 357 patients suspected to have PCa. All patients received TRUS-guided 10-core SB and SE-guided TB. The sensitivity for PCa detected by SE-guided TB was compared with that by TRUS-guided SB, in combination with prostate biopsy pathology. The correlation between the prostate volume and the detection rate of SE-guided TB was investigated. RESULTS PCa was pathologically confirmed in 151 out of 357 patients. The by-patient detection rate of TRUS-guided SB was 72.8% (110/151). Subsequently, a further increase of 6.6% (10/151) in PCa determination was obtained by the SE-guided TB. The sensitivity of SE-guided TB for patients with prostate volume <30 ml, 30-50 ml, 51-80 ml, and >80 ml was 91.7% (44/48), 80.3% (53/66), 70.4% (19/27), and 40.0% (4/10), respectively (p=0.002). For patients with a prostate volume less than 30 ml, SE-guided TB (91.7%) had a higher sensitivity than SB (62.5%) (p<0.007). CONCLUSIONS SE-guided TB has a higher detection rate of PCa in comparison with TRUS-guided SB. There was also a negative correlation between prostate volume and SE-guided TB.

In an exploratory analysis, age-adjusted gene set enrichment analysis identified statin-associated pathways enriched in tumor and adjacent normal prostate tissue.  Results:   During 24 years of follow-up, 6,305 prostate cancers were diagnosed and 801 (13%) were lethal (metastatic at diagnosis or metastatic/fatal during follow-up). Relative to never/past use, current statin use was inversely associated with risk of lethal prostate cancer [HR, 0.76; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.60-0.96] but not overall disease. We found a strong inverse association for risk of PTEN-null cancers (HR, 0.40; 95% CI, 0.19-0.87) but not PTEN-intact cancers (HR, 1.18; 95% CI, 0.95-1.48; P heterogeneity = 0.01). Associations did not differ by ERG. Inflammation and immune pathways were enriched in normal prostate tissue of statin ever (n = 10) versus never users (n = 103).  Conclusions:   Molecular tumor classification identified PTEN and inflammation/immune activation as potential mechanisms linking statins with lower lethal prostate cancer risk. These findings support a potential causal association and could inform selection of relevant biomarkers for statin clinical trials.""","""['Emma H Allott', 'Ericka M Ebot', 'Konrad H Stopsack', 'Amparo G Gonzalez-Feliciano', 'Sarah C Markt', 'Kathryn M Wilson', 'Thomas U Ahearn', 'Travis A Gerke', 'Mary K Downer', 'Jennifer R Rider', 'Stephen J Freedland', 'Tamara L Lotan', 'Philip W Kantoff', 'Elizabeth A Platz', 'Massimo Loda', 'Meir J Stampfer', 'Edward Giovannucci', 'Christopher J Sweeney#', 'Stephen P Finn#', 'Lorelei A Mucci#']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Clin Cancer Res""","""['Re: Statin Use is Associated with Lower Risk of PTEN-Null and Lethal Prostate Cancer.', 'A Prospective Investigation of PTEN Loss and ERG Expression in Lethal Prostate Cancer.', 'Family history of prostate cancer and the incidence of ERG- and phosphatase and tensin homolog-defined prostate cancer.', 'The association of diabetes with risk of prostate cancer defined by clinical and molecular features.', 'Clinical Utility and Biologic Implications of Phosphatase and Tensin Homolog (PTEN) and ETS-related Gene (ERG) in Prostate Cancer.', 'Statins and prostate cancer-hype or hope?

Inception cohorts of patients with colorectal, breast and prostate cancers were assembled using the incident cases originally recruited.  Participants:   2140 new cases of colorectal cancer, 1732 of breast cancer and 1112 of prostate cancer were initially recruited in 12 Spanish provinces; all cancers were incident and pathologically confirmed. Follow-up was obtained for 2097 (98%), 1685 (97%) and 1055 (94.9%) patients, respectively.  Findings to date:   Information gathered at recruitment included sociodemographic factors, medical history, lifestyle and environmental exposures. Biological samples were obtained, and 80% of patients were genotyped using a commercial exome array. The follow-up was performed by (1) reviewing medical records; (2) interviewing the patients by phone on quality of life; and (3) verifying vital status and cause of death in the Spanish National Death Index. Ninety-seven per cent of recruited patients were successfully followed up in 2017 or 2018; patient-years of follow-up were 30 914. Most colorectal cancers (52%) were at clinical stage II or lower at recruitment; 819 patients died in the follow-up and the 5-year survival was better for women (74.4%) than men (70.0%). 71% of breast cancers were diagnosed at stages I or II; 206 women with breast cancer died in the follow-up and the 5-year survival was 90.7%. 49% of prostate cancers were diagnosed at stage II and 32% at stage III; 119 patients with prostate cancer died in the follow-up and the 5-year survival was 93.7%.

Subjects and methods:   A retrospectively maintained single institution multiparametric MRI database (n = 1667) was queried to identify 355 patients who underwent MR/US fusion biopsy, including both targeted biopsy and concurrent systematic biopsy from December 1, 2014 to June 1, 2018. Clinical, pathological, and imaging variables were assessed on fusion biopsy (Table 1) to determine who met theoretical selection criteria for HA, defined as unilateral intermediate-risk prostate cancer per NCCN criteria (Grade Group [GG] 2 or 3 with prostate-specific antigen <20) and no evidence of extraprostatic extension (EPE) on multiparametric MRI. Predictors of selection criteria failure were then assessed in patients who also underwent radical prostatectomy (RP). Failure of the theoretical HA selection criteria was defined as presence of GG ≧ 2 on the contralateral (untreated) side, or the presence of high-risk disease (any GG ≧ 4 or EPE) in the RP specimen.  Results:   Of the 355 patients who underwent fusion biopsy, 84 patients met the theoretical selection criteria for HA. Of those patients eligible, 54 underwent RP, 37 (68.5%) of which represented unsuccessful HA selection criteria. Patients no longer met HA selection criteria on the basis of upgrading alone in 6/54 (11.1%), EPE alone in 9/54 (16.7%), bilateral GG 2 or 3 in 16/54 (29.6%) or combined EPE and bilateral GG 2 or 3 in 6/54 (11.1%) cases. In the HA selection failures due to upgrading, three also had EPE, one of whom also had missed contralateral GG ≧ 2 disease. The only factor independently associated with HA failure was any presence of cribriform pattern (HR 7.01, P = 0.021). Perineural invasion on systematic biopsyalso appeared to improve the performance of our multivariable model (HR 5.33, P = 0.052), though it was not statistically significant when using a cutoff of <0.05. Accuracy for predicting successful HA was 0.32 and improved to 0.74 if PNI or cribriform were excluded and 0.84 if both were excluded.  Conclusions:   In a retrospective analysis of RP patients who underwent preoperative MRI/US fusion biopsy, current selection criteria for prostatic HA based on NCCN intermediate-risk stratification failed to accurately identify appropriate candidates in 68.5% of patients. Cribriform pattern and PNI detected on biopsy reduced the failure of hemigland selection criteria to 43%.

Several drugs targeting distinct phases of the cell cycle have been developed but the inability of many of them to discriminate between normal and cancer cells has strongly limited their clinical potential because of their reduced efficacy at the concentrations used to limit adverse side effects. Mechanisms of resistance have also been described, further affecting their efficacy. Identification of novel targets that can potentiate the effect of these drugs or overcome drug resistance can provide a useful strategy to exploit the anti-cancer properties of these agents to their fullest.  Methods:   The class II PI3K isoform PI3K-C2β was downregulated in prostate cancer PC3 cells and cervical cancer HeLa cells using selective siRNAs and the effect on cell growth was determined in the absence or presence of the microtubule-stabilizing agent/anti-cancer drug docetaxel. Mitosis progression was monitored by time-lapse microscopy. Clonogenic assays were performed to determine the ability of PC3 and HeLa cells to form colonies upon PI3K-C2β downregulation in the absence or presence of docetaxel. Cell multi-nucleation was assessed by immunofluorescence. Tumour growth in vivo was assessed using a xenograft model of PC3 cells upon PI3K-C2β downregulation and in combination with docetaxel.  Results:   Downregulation of PI3K-C2β delays mitosis progression in PC3 and HeLa cells, resulting in reduced ability to form colonies in clonogenic assays in vitro. Compared to control cells, PC3 cells lacking PI3K-C2β form smaller and more compact colonies in vitro and they form tumours more slowly in vivo in the first weeks after cells implant. Stable and transient PI3K-C2β downregulation potentiates the effect of low concentrations of docetaxel on cancer cell growth. Combination of PI3K-C2β downregulation and docetaxel almost completely prevents colonies formation in clonogenic assays in vitro and strongly inhibits tumour growth in vivo.  Conclusions:   These data reveal a novel role for the class II PI3K PI3K-C2β during mitosis progression. Furthermore, data indicate that blockade of PI3K-C2β might represent a novel strategy to potentiate the effect of docetaxel on cancer cell growth.""","""['Ouma Cisse', 'Muzthahid Quraishi', 'Federico Gulluni', 'Federica Guffanti', 'Ioanna Mavrommati', 'Methushaa Suthanthirakumaran', 'Lara C R Oh', 'Jessica N Schlatter', 'Ambisha Sarvananthan', 'Massimo Broggini', 'Emilio Hirsch', 'Marco Falasca', 'Tania Maffucci']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""J Exp Clin Cancer Res""","""['Class II phosphoinositide 3-kinase C2β regulates a novel signaling pathway involved in breast cancer progression.', 'Everolimus (RAD001) sensitizes prostate cancer cells to docetaxel by down-regulation of HIF-1α and sphingosine kinase 1.', 'Molecular Mechanism Mediating Cytotoxic Activity of Cabazitaxel in Docetaxel-resistant Human Prostate Cancer Cells.', 'Class II phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase isoforms in vesicular trafficking.', 'Regulation and cellular functions of class II phosphoinositide 3-kinases.', 'PI3K/AKT/mTOR Dysregulation and Reprogramming Metabolic Pathways in Renal Cancer: Crosstalk with the VHL/HIF Axis.', 'Targeting Class I-II-III PI3Ks in Cancer Therapy: Recent Advances in Tumor Biology and Preclinical Research.', 'Current State and Future Challenges for PI3K Inhibitors in Cancer Therapy.', 'Targeting PI3K/Akt signaling in prostate cancer therapy.', 'Phosphoinositide species and filamentous actin formation mediate engulfment by senescent tumor cells.']"""

Sumoylation of AR can influence its function. However, regulation of AR sumoylation by SUMO E3 ligases PIASs to modify AR distribution and stability are not well understood.  Methods:   We assessed the potential effect of SUMO3 modification on AR intracellular localization by immunostaining in AR-negative prostate cancer DU145 cells, and detected the effect of PIAS1/SUMO3 overexpression on AR sumoylation related degradation. Then we characterized AR sumoylation sites involved modified by SUMO3, and the key residue of PIAS1 involved in itself sumoylation and further mediated AR sumoylation (sumo3-conjugated), translocation and degradation. Finally we detected the recognition of PIAS1 (sumoylation ligase) to MDM2, a ubiquin ligase mediated AR degradation.  Results:   We demonstrate that SUMO E3 ligase PIAS1, along with SUMO3, mediates AR cytosolic translocation and subsequent degradation via a ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Although AR sumoylation occurs prior to ubiquitination, the SUMO-acceptor lysine 386 on AR, together with ubiquitin-acceptor lysine 845, contribute to PIAS1/SUMO3-induced AR nuclear export, ubiquitination and subsequent degradation. Moreover, PIAS1 itself is modified by SUMO3 overexpression, and mutation of SUMO-acceptor lysine 117 on PIAS1 can impair AR cytoplasmic distribution, demonstrating the essential role of sumoylated PIAS1 in AR translocation. We further determine that sumoylated PIAS1 interacts with AR lysine 386 and 845 to form a binary complex. Consistent with the effect on AR distribution, SUMO3 modification of PIAS1 is also required for AR ubiquitination and degradation by recruiting ubiquitin E3 ligase MDM2.  Conclusion:   Taken together, SUMO3 modification of PIAS1 modulates AR cellular distribution and stability. Our study provided the evidence the crosstalk between AR sumoylation and ubquitination mediated by PIAS1 and SUMO3.""","""['Nanyang Yang', 'Sitong Liu', 'Tian Qin', 'Xintong Liu', 'Nobumoto Watanabe', 'Kevin H Mayo', 'Jiang Li', 'Xiaomeng Li']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Cell Commun Signal""","""['Protein inhibitor of activated STAT 1 (PIAS1) is identified as the SUMO E3 ligase of CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein β (C/EBPβ) during adipogenesis.', 'PIAS1 and PIASxalpha function as SUMO-E3 ligases toward androgen receptor and repress androgen receptor-dependent transcription.', 'c-Myc is targeted to the proteasome for degradation in a SUMOylation-dependent manner, regulated by PIAS1, SENP7 and RNF4.', 'Roles of Ubiquitination and SUMOylation in DNA Damage Response.', 'Implications of ubiquitin ligases in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Cancer-Associated Dysregulation of Sumo Regulators: Proteases and Ligases.', 'The Role of SUMO E3 Ligases in Signaling Pathway of Cancer Cells.', 'RNF166 plays a dual role for Lys63-linked ubiquitination and sumoylation of its target proteins.', 'Trisomy of Human Chromosome 21 Orthologs Mapping to Mouse Chromosome 10 Cause Age and Sex-Specific Learning Differences: Relevance to Down Syndrome.', 'Context Fear Conditioning in Down Syndrome Mouse Models: Effects of Trisomic Gene Content, Age, Sex and Genetic Background.']"""

Studies have suggested the involvement of non-coding RNAs, especially micro-RNAs (miRNAs), in the regulation of multiple cellular events in cancer and thus several clinical trials are ongoing using miRNAs mimics or inhibitors. We previously demonstrated that miRNA-29b-3p (miR-29b) was downregulated in prostate cancer and that the overexpression of miR-29b limited prostate cancer metastasis. However, the therapeutic potential of the miR-29b against prostate cancer remains unknown. Here, we evaluated the therapeutic role of miR-29b in in vivo prostate tumors in a mouse model. Intratumoral injection of mimic miR-29b significantly inhibited prostate cancer xenograft tumor growth in nude mice. Subsequent study demonstrated that the overexpression of miR-29b reduced prostate cancer cell PC3 proliferation in a time dependent manner and induced cell death. Mechanistic study using a cancer pathway specific transcriptomic array revealed a significant overexpression of the pro-apoptotic gene BCL2L11 (Bim) in the miR-29b overexpressed PC3 cells, which was further verified in PC3 cells overexpressing miR-29b. We also observed a significant induction of Bim protein in miR-29b treated xenograft tumors. The induction of cytosolic accumulation of cytochrome C and PARP cleavage in miR-29b overexpressed PC3 cells was observed. Thus, our results suggest that miR-29b can be used as a potential molecule for prostate cancer therapy.""","""['Subhayan Sur', 'Robert Steele', 'Xingyi Shi', 'Ratna B Ray']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Cells""","""['miRNA-29b suppresses prostate cancer metastasis by regulating epithelial-mesenchymal transition signaling.', 'A miR-29b Byproduct Sequence Exhibits Potent Tumor-Suppressive Activities via Inhibition of NF-κB Signaling in KRAS-Mutant Colon Cancer Cells.', 'miR-375 induces docetaxel resistance in prostate cancer by targeting SEC23A and YAP1.', 'microRNA-29b: an emerging player in human cancer.', 'Restoring TGFβ1 pathway-related microRNAs: possible impact in metastatic prostate cancer development.', 'Changes in the expression of cancer- and metastasis-related genes and proteins after metformin treatment under different metabolic conditions in endometrial cancer cells.', 'MicroRNA-nanoparticles against cancer: Opportunities and challenges for personalized medicine.', 'LncRNA MBNL1-AS1 Suppresses Cell Proliferation and Metastasis of Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma through Targeting Carcinogenic miR-301b-3p.', 'MiR-124-3p inhibits tumor progression in prostate cancer by targeting EZH2.', 'Tumor Suppressor miR-613 Alleviates Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Cell via Repressing M2 Macrophage Polarization.']"""

Materials and methods:   35,533 men with PSA screening were retrospectively enrolled in this study. Follow-ups were conducted in 1,586 men with PSA >4 ng/mL, and receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curves were employed to investigate the optimal cutoffs.

By exploiting methoxypoly(ethylene glycol)-block-poly(D, L-lactic acid) (mPEG-PLA) as a promoiety, cabazitaxel is tethered to the terminus of the PLA fragment via a hydrolysable ester linkage.

Even with the best treatment, tumor recurrence and metastases always occur. While clinicians commonly observe the metastases to pelvic lymph nodes, liver, lung, and bone, it may infrequently spread to some uncommon locations.  Patient concerns:   The patient was a 67-year-old man with a diagnosis of high-grade TCC with squamous differentiation in the bladder and prostate. Subsequently, radical cystoprostatectomy, adjuvant radiotherapy, and chemotherapy were performed. However, he felt intermittent right scrotal pain about 1 year later.  Diagnosis:   Ultrasound strongly suggested a testicular neoplasm of right testis, but the left was normal.  Interventions:   The patient underwent a right radical orchiectomy and histopathology confirmed testicular metastatic neoplasm from bladder. Moreover, further examination with positron emission tomography revealed no visible distant spread of the urothelial carcinoma.  Outcomes:   No signs of tumor recurrence or distant metastasis were visible under follow-up 1 year after radical orchiectomy.  Lessons:   Testicular mass may be metastatic tumor during follow-up for patients who were diagnosed as BC, especially for TCC with variant histology. The reason of this could be explained of residual micrometastases after surgery and need more examination to discover local micrometastases to apply more aggressive treatment.""","""['Kaijie Wu', 'Junjie Fan', 'Hua Liang', 'Yu Yao', 'Dalin He']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Medicine (Baltimore)""","""['Sanctuary Testicular Bladder Cancer Metastasis 10 Years After Radical Cystectomy and Adjuvant Chemotherapy.', 'Testicular metastasis of transitional cell carcinoma of the urinary bladder: an unusual site.', 'Testicular metastasis of transitional cell carcinoma of the prostate.', 'Prostatic involvement by urothelial carcinoma in patients with bladder cancer and their implications in the clinical practice.', 'Clear cell urothelial carcinoma of the urinary bladder: a case report and review of the literature.', 'Testicular metastasis from urothelial carcinoma of the bladder.']"""

Although AR plays a key role, it is likely that other molecular pathways also contribute to PC, making it essential to identify and develop drugs against novel targets. Recent studies have identified peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ), a nuclear receptor that regulates fatty acid (FA) metabolism, as a novel target in PC, and suggest that inhibitors of PPARγ could be used to treat existing disease. We hypothesized that PPARγ acts through AR-dependent and independent mechanisms to control PC development and growth and that PPARγ inhibition is a viable PC treatment strategy.  Methods:   Immunohistochemistry was used to determine expression of PPARү in a cohort of patients with PC. Standard molecular techniques were used to investigate the PPARү signaling in PC cells as well a xenograft mouse model to test PPARү inhibition in vivo. Kaplan-Meier curves were created using cBioportal.  Results:   We confirmed the expression of PPARү in human PC. We then showed that small molecule inhibition of PPARγ decreases the growth of AR-positive and -negative PC cells in vitro and that T0070907, a potent PPARγ antagonist, significantly decreased the growth of human PC xenografts in nude mice. We found that PPARγ antagonists or small interfering RNA (siRNA) do not affect mitochondrial activity nor do they cause apoptosis; instead, they arrest the cell cycle. In AR-positive PC cells, antagonists and siRNAs reduce AR transcript and protein levels, which could contribute to growth inhibition. AR-independent effects on growth appear to be mediated by effects on FA metabolism as the specific FASN inhibitor, Fasnall, inhibited PC cell growth but did not have an additive effect when combined with PPARγ antagonists. Patients with increased PPARү target gene expression, but not alterations in PPARү itself, were found to have significantly worse overall survival.  Conclusions:   Having elucidated the direct cancer cell effects of PPARγ inhibition, our studies have helped to determine the role of PPARγ in PC growth, and support the hypothesis that PPARγ inhibition is an effective strategy for PC treatment.""","""['Catherine C Elix', 'Meghan M Salgia', 'Maya Otto-Duessel', 'Ben T Copeland', 'Christopher Yoo', 'Michael Lee', 'Ben Yi Tew', 'David Ann', 'Sumanta K Pal', 'Jeremy O Jones']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['The Androgen Receptor Regulates PPARγ Expression and Activity in Human Prostate Cancer Cells.', 'The PPARγ ligand ciglitazone regulates androgen receptor activation differently in androgen-dependent versus androgen-independent human prostate cancer cells.', 'The role of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma in prostate cancer.', 'Vitamin K epoxide reductase regulation of androgen receptor activity.', 'Androgen receptor-dependent and -independent mechanisms driving prostate cancer progression: Opportunities for therapeutic targeting from multiple angles.', 'The role of PPARγ in prostate cancer development and progression.', 'Histone methyltransferase KMT2D mediated lipid metabolism via peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma in prostate cancer.', 'Lipogenesis inhibitors: therapeutic opportunities and challenges.', 'PPAR-γ Modulators as Current and Potential Cancer Treatments.', 'The Influence of Anti-Diabetic Drugs on Prostate Cancer.']"""

Subgroup analyses based on a history of cerebrovascular disease (CVD) were performed to evaluate the impact thereof on overall survival (OS) after local treatment.  Materials and methods:   A retrospective analysis was performed for 879 patients with de novo mHSPC between August 2003 and November 2016. Patients were stratified according to prior CVD history and the type of initial treatment: androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT) alone versus local treatment consisting of radical prostatectomy (RP) or radiation therapy (RT) with ADT, with or without metastasis-directed therapy. The primary outcome was OS assessed by Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox-regression models.  Results:   Of 879 patients, 660 (75.1%) men underwent ADT alone, and 219 (24.9%) men underwent RP or RT with ADT, with or without metastasis-directed therapy. The median follow-up was 38 months. Multivariable analysis showed CVD history to be associated with a higher risk of overall mortality (p=0.001). In the overall cohort and in patients without a history of CVD, patients who underwent local treatment exhibited higher OS than men who received ADT alone (all p<0.001). However, the survival benefit conferred by local treatment was not seen in patients with a history of CVD (p=0.324). OS was comparable between patients who received RP and RT (p=0.521).

To improve the anti-cancer activity and to study the detailed mechanism of anti-cancer action, here we have used bioactive compound curcumin (Cur) in combination with Ola. Incubation of Ola in Cur pre-treated cells synergistically increased the death of oral cancer cells at much lower concentrations than individual optimum dose and inhibited the topoisomerase activity. Short exposure of Cur caused DNA damage in cells, but more increased DNA damage was noticed when Ola has incubated in Cur pre-treated cells. This combination did not alter the major components of homologous recombination (HR) and non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) pathways but significantly altered both short patch (SP) and long patch (LP) base excision repair (BER) components in cancer cells. Significant reduction in relative luciferase activity, expression of BER components and PARylation after Cur and Ola treatment confirmed this combination inhibit the BER activity in cells.

Serum PSA level, International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS), quality of life score (QoLs), maximal flow rate (Qmax), and post-void residual volume (PVR) at 3, 6, 12, and 18 months after treatment were comparatively analyzed. The perioperative and postoperative parameters of HoLEP were assessed. Both groups demonstrated significant improvement in IPSS, QoLs, Qmax, and PVR during follow-up. But these parameters of HoLEP group improved more rapidly, significantly, and durably than CAB group. No serious complications were observed during and after HoLEP. PSA level of patients in both groups declined dramatically after surgery. But PSA in HoLEP group showed more dramatic and continuous drop. Besides, 1 of 21 patients in HoLEP group transferred into castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) at 18th month of follow-up. While in CAB group, 5 of 17 patients developed into CRPC at 12th month of follow-up (P = 0.02 < 0.05).

In this context, we developed ST-4PC, an injectable, polymeric paste formulation containing docetaxel (dtx) and bicalutamide (bic) for image-guided focal therapy of PCa. The objective of this work was to evaluate the in vitro characteristics and in vivo toxicity and efficacy of ST-4PC.  Material and methods:   In vitro drug release was evaluated using high-performance liquid chromatography. In vivo toxicity of blank- and drug-loaded ST-4PC was assessed in mice and rats. Tumor growth inhibition was evaluated in LNCaP subcutaneous (s.c.) and LNCaP-luc orthotopic xenograft models. Using the s.c. model, mice were monitored weekly for weight loss, tumor volume (TV) and serum PSA. For the orthotopic model, mice were additionally monitored for bioluminescence as measure of tumor growth.  Results:   ST-4PC demonstrated a sustained and steady release of incorporated drugs with 50% dtx and 20% bic being released after 14 days. While no systemic toxicity was observed, dose-dependent local side effects from dtx developed in the s.c. but not in the orthotopic model, illustrating the limitations of s.c. models for evaluating local cytotoxic therapy. In the s.c. model, 0.1%/4% and 0.25%/4% dtx/bic ST-4PC paste significantly reduced PSA progression, but did not have a significant inhibitory effect on TV. ST-4PC loaded with 1%/4% dtx/bic significantly reduced TV, serum PSA, and bioluminescence in the orthotopic xenograft model. Compared with drugs dissolved in DMSO, ST-4PC significantly delayed tumor growth.

Machine learning offers opportunities to improve the diagnosis, risk stratification, and prognostication of prostate cancer.  Objective:   To develop a state-of-the-art deep learning algorithm for the histopathologic diagnosis and Gleason grading of prostate biopsy specimens.  Design, setting, and participants:   A total of 85 prostate core biopsy specimens from 25 patients were digitized at 20× magnification and annotated for Gleason 3, 4, and 5 prostate adenocarcinoma by a urologic pathologist. From these virtual slides, we sampled 14803 image patches of 256×256 pixels, approximately balanced for malignancy.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   We trained and tested a deep residual convolutional neural network to classify each patch at two levels: (1) coarse (benign vs malignant) and (2) fine (benign vs Gleason 3 vs 4 vs 5). Model performance was evaluated using fivefold cross-validation. Randomization tests were used for hypothesis testing of model performance versus chance.  Results and limitations:   The model demonstrated 91.5% accuracy (p<0.001) at coarse-level classification of image patches as benign versus malignant (0.93 sensitivity, 0.90 specificity, and 0.95 average precision). The model demonstrated 85.4% accuracy (p<0.001) at fine-level classification of image patches as benign versus Gleason 3 versus Gleason 4 versus Gleason 5 (0.83 sensitivity, 0.94 specificity, and 0.83 average precision), with the greatest number of confusions in distinguishing between Gleason 3 and 4, and between Gleason 4 and 5. Limitations include the small sample size and the need for external validation.

Whereas part 1 of the ""surgery-in-motion"" paper focused on acquisition, this paper shows the correlation between (ab)normal prostate anatomical structures and image characteristics on mpMRI, and how standardized interpretation according to Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System version 2 (PI-RADS v2) should be performed.

Surgical procedure:   To detect csPCa, three mpMRI ""components"" are used: ""anatomic"" T2-weighted imaging, ""cellular-density"" diffusion-weighted imaging, and ""vascularity"" dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI.  Measurements:   Based on PI-RADS v2, the accompanying video shows how mpMRI interpretation is performed. Finally, the role of mpMRI in detecting csPCa is briefly discussed and the main features of the recently introduced PI-RADS v2.1 are evaluated.  Results and limitations:   With PI-RADS v2, it is possible to quantify normal and abnormal anatomical structures within the prostate based on its imaging features of the three mpMRI ""components.""

We present a pre-planned analysis of the impact of IGRT on dosimetry and acute/late pelvic side effects using gastrointestinal and genitourinary clinician and patient-reported outcomes (PRO) and evaluate efficacy.  Materials and methods:   CHHiP is a randomised phase 3, non-inferiority trial for men with localised prostate cancer. 3216 patients were randomly assigned to conventional (74 Gy in 2 Gy/fraction (f) daily) or moderate hypofractionation (60 or 57 Gy in 3 Gy/f daily) between October 2002 and June 2011. The IGRT substudy included a second randomisation assigning to no-IGRT, IGRT-S (standard CTV-PTV margins), or IGRT-R (reduced CTV-PTV margins). Primary substudy endpoint was late RTOG bowel and urinary toxicity at 2 years post-radiotherapy.  Results:   Between June 2010 to July 2011, 293 men were recruited from 16 centres.

Patients and methods:   The patients' individual data were analyzed to investigate whether different sequencing strategies lead to differences in OS.  Results:   We analyzed the data of 1099 evaluable patients.

These compounds were prepared through an aldolic condensation by adding tetrahydropyranyl-protected benzaldehydes or substituted benzaldehyde to a reaction mixture containing 4-Boc-piperidone and lithium hydroxide in an alcoholic solvent. A 44-94% yield was obtained supporting the developed methodology as a good strategy for the synthesis of 4-Boc-piperidone chalcones. Cytotoxic activity against LoVo and COLO 205 human colorectal cell lines was observed at GI50 values that range from 0.84 to 34.7 μg/mL, while in PC3 and 22RV1 human prostate cancer cell lines, GI50 values ranging from 17.1 to 22.9 μg/mL were obtained.

The nonprotein coding gene locus plasmacytoma variant translocation 1 (PVT1) is located at 8q24 and is dysregulated in different cancers. PVT1 gives rise to several alternatively spliced transcripts and microRNAs. There are at least twelve exons of PVT1, which make separate transcripts, and likely have different functions. Here, we demonstrate that PVT1 exon 9 is significantly overexpressed in PCa tissues in comparison to normal prostate tissues. Both transient and stable overexpression of PVT1 exon 9 significantly induced greater prostate epithelial cell migration, as well as increased proliferation and corresponding proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) expression. Notably, implantation into mice of a non-tumorigenic prostate epithelial cell line stably overexpressing PVT1 exon 9 resulted in the formation of malignant tumors. Furthermore, PVT1 exon 9 overexpression significantly induced castration resistance. Consequently, PVT1 exon 9 expression is important for PCa initiation and progression, and holds promise as a therapeutic target in PCa.""","""['Gargi Pal', 'Jeannette Huaman', 'Fayola Levine', 'Akintunde Orunmuyi', 'E Oluwabunmi Olapade-Olaopa', 'Onayemi T Onagoruwa', 'Olorunseun O Ogunwobi']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Genes (Basel)""","""['lncRNA PVT1: a novel oncogene in multiple cancers.', 'Population Differentiation at the PVT1 Gene Locus: Implications for Prostate Cancer.', 'Copy number-based quantification assay for non-invasive detection of PVT1-derived transcripts.', 'PVT1 Exon 9: A Potential Biomarker of Aggressive Prostate Cancer?', 'Long non-coding RNA PVT1: Emerging biomarker in digestive system cancer.', 'Regulation mechanism and pathogenic role of lncRNA plasmacytoma variant translocation 1 (PVT1) in human diseases.', 'lncRNA PVT1: a novel oncogene in multiple cancers.', 'Long non-coding RNA PVT1: A promising chemotherapy and radiotherapy sensitizer.', 'Long non-coding RNA in prostate cancer.', 'Prostate Cancer Genomics Research Disparities in Africa: Advancing Knowledge in Resource Constrained Settings.']"""

Knockdown (KD) of KDM4C suppressed cell proliferation, soft agar colony formation, and androgen receptor (AR) transcriptional activity in PCa cells as well as reduced tumor growth of human PCa cells in zebrafish xenotransplantation assay. Micro-Western array (MWA) analysis indicated that KD of KDM4C protein decreased the phosphorylation of AKT, c-Myc, AR, mTOR, PDK1, phospho-PDK1 S241, KDM8, and proteins involved in cell cycle regulators, while it increased the expression of PTEN. Fluorescent microscopy revealed that KDM4C co-localized with AR and c-Myc in the nuclei of PCa cells. Overexpression of either AKT or c-Myc rescued the suppressive effect of KDM4C KD on PCa cell proliferation. Echoing the above findings, the mRNA and protein expression of KDM4C was higher in human prostate tumor tissues as compared to adjacent normal prostate tissues, and higher KDM4C protein expression in prostate tumors correlated to higher protein expression level of AKT and c-Myc.

Because gay and bisexual men have less social support than their heterosexual peers, some have argued that pet companionship could provide emotional support, while others have argued the opposite, that having a pet is another stressor. This analysis examines the association between having dogs, cats, both animals, or no animals and quality of life using the 12-item Short Form (SF-12) mental and physical composite quality of life scores for gay and bisexual prostate cancer survivors, post-treatment. Participants were 189 gay, bisexual, or other men who have sex with men, who completed online surveys in 2015. Linear regression analysis found that participants with cats and participants with dogs had lower mental quality of life scores than participants without pets. After adjustment for covariates, mental health scores remained significantly lower for cat owners, dog owners, and owners of both animals compared to those of participants who did not have pets. No differences were seen for physical quality of life scores after adjustment. We conclude that pet companionship may be a net stressor for gay and bisexual men following prostate cancer treatment. As this is the first study of pet companionship in sexual minorities, further research is needed to confirm the reliability of these findings, generalizability, and temporality of the association.""","""['Morgan M Wright', 'Pamela Schreiner', 'B R Simon Rosser', 'Elizabeth J Polter', 'Darryl Mitteldorf', 'William West', 'Michael W Ross']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Int J Environ Res Public Health""","""['Health-related quality of life by human immunodeficiency virus status in a cross-sectional survey of gay and bisexual prostate cancer survivors.', 'Sexual Quality of Life in Homosexual and Bisexual Men: The Relative Role of Minority Stress.', 'The Experiences of Gay and Bisexual Men Post-Prostate Cancer Treatment: A Meta-Synthesis of Qualitative Studies.', 'Sex After Prostate Cancer in Gay and Bisexual Men: A Review of the Literature.', 'Racialized Sexual Discrimination (RSD) in the Age of Online Sexual Networking: Are Young Black Gay/Bisexual Men (YBGBM) at Elevated Risk for Adverse Psychological Health?', ""Pet's influence on humans' daily physical activity and mental health: a meta-analysis."", 'Pet ownership during the first 5 years after breast cancer diagnosis in the NEON-BC cohort.', 'Health outcomes of sexual and gender minorities after cancer: a systematic review.', 'The Psycho-Social Impact of Human-Animal Interactions.']"""

Methods:   Data on patients treated for a primary pelvic cancer between 1989 and 2007 were retrieved from the population-based Netherlands Cancer Registry. Patients treated for more than one pelvic cancer were excluded. To estimate the cumulative incidence of rectal cancer, Fine and Gray's competing risk model was used with death as a competing event. Survival was calculated using multivariable Cox regression.  Results:   A total of 192,658 patients were included, of which 62,630 patients were treated with RT for their pelvic cancer. Primary tumours were located in the prostate (50.1%), bladder (19.2%), endometrium (13.9%), ovaries (10.0%), cervix (6.4%) and vagina (0.4%). At a median interval of 6 years (range 0-24), 1369 patients developed a rectal cancer. Overall, the risk for rectal cancer was increased in patients who underwent RT for the previous pelvic cancer (subhazard ratio [SHR]: 1.72, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.55-1.91). Analysis for each tumour location specifically showed an increased risk in patients who received RT for prostate (SHR: 1.89, 95% CI: 1.66-2.16) or endometrial cancer (SHR: 1.50, 95% CI: 1.13-2.00). A protective effect of RT was observed for patients with bladder cancer (SHR 0.67, 95% CI: 0.47-0.94). There was no survival difference between patients with rectal cancer with or without previous RT (hazard ratio: 0.94, 95% CI: 0.79-1.11).  Conclusions:   Patients who received RT for a previous pelvic cancer were at increased risk for rectal cancer.

But the antitumor mechanism of WPPs was not clearly understood. Therefore, in the present study, we further investigated the antitumor mechanism of WPPs in DU145 cells and a xenograft mice model. The results showed that WPPs decreased the levels of PI3K, AKT, p-AKT and Bcl-2 proteins, and increased expression of Bax, caspase-3 and caspase-9 in DU145 cells (P < 0.05). The in vivo data demonstrated that WPPs resulted in a significant dose-dependent increase (P < 0.05) in the number of apoptotic cells in tumor tissues. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that the activated PI3K, AKT, p-AKT and Bcl-2 levels were decreased and the level of caspase-3 was increased in DU145 xenografts mice model. Therefore, the antitumor mechanism of WPPs on DU145 cells may involve regulation of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, which eventually promotes apoptosis.

The primary end point was RECIST 1.1 objective response rate (ORR).  Results:   Two percent of 4,902 screened patients had an MMR-deficient cancer by IHC. Forty-two evaluable patients were enrolled, with a median age of 60 years and a median of 3 prior therapies. The most common histologies were endometrioid endometrial adenocarcinoma (n = 13), prostate adenocarcinoma (n = 5), and uterine carcinosarcoma (n = 4). ORR was 36% (15 of 42 patients). An additional 21% of patients had stable disease. The estimated 6-, 12-, and 18-month progression-free survival rates were 51.3% (90% CI, 38.2% to 64.5%), 46.2% (90% CI, 33.1% to 59.3%), and 31.4% (90% CI, 18.7% to 44.2%), respectively. Median overall survival was 17.3 months. Toxicity was predominantly low grade.  Conclusion:   A variety of refractory cancers (2.0% of those screened) had MMR deficiency as defined in NCI-MATCH.

To understand racial differences, we assessed incidence rates, analyzed trends, and examined geographic variation in incidence by Indian Health Service regions.  Methods:   To assess differences in incidence, we used age-adjusted incidence rates to calculate rate ratios (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Using joinpoint regression, we analyzed incidence trends over time for the four leading cancers from 1999 to 2015.  Results:   For all four cancers, overall and age-specific incidence rates were lower among AI/ANs than NHWs. By Indian Health Service regions, incidence rates for lung cancer were higher among AI/ANs than NHWs in Alaska (RR: 1.46; 95% CI: 1.37, 1.56) and Northern (RR: 1.29; 95% CI: 1.25, 1.33) and Southern (RR: 1.06; 95% CI: 1.03, 1.09) Plains.

Method:   The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database was used to analyze the incidence and outcomes of SCPC between the years 2004 through 2016. Limited-stage SCPC (LS-SCPC) was defined as SCPC without any metastasis regardless of local invasion. Extensive stage SCPC (ES-SCPC) was defined as any metastasis to lymph nodes and/or to distant organs.  Result:   A total of 403 SCPC patients were included in the study cohort, accounting for 0.056% of all prostate cancer cases (n=719,655). Of the 358 patients with known metastasis status, 275 (76.8%) patients had ES-SCPC, whereas 83 (23.2%) patients had LS-SCPC. LS-SCPC was associated with better overall survival (17 vs. 9 mo, P<0.001) and disease-specific survival (25 vs. 10 mo, P<0.001) compared with ES-SCPC. All LS-SCPC patients had a similar overall survival regardless of T stage. Similarly, all ES-SCPC patients had similar outcomes regardless of metastasis sites. High prostate-specific antigen (PSA) is paradoxically associated with superior outcome in both localized stage patients (PSA≥4 vs. PSA<4, 19 vs. 10 mo, P=0.002) and extensive stage patients (PSA≥20 vs. PSA<20, 13 vs. 9 mo, P=0.02). Multivariate analysis of treatment showed that chemotherapy was associated with improved survival in ES-SCPC with hazard ratio of 0.52.  Conclusion:   Similar to small cell lung cancer, SCPC can be staged into LS-SCPC or ES-SCPC. The binary staging system correlates well with prognosis.""","""['Salman Syed', 'Spyridon P Basourakos', 'Faisal S Ali', 'Jessica L Garcia', 'Amado Zurita-Saavedra', 'Zimu Gong']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Am J Clin Oncol""","""['The Role of Prostate-specific Antigen Persistence After Radical Prostatectomy for the Prediction of Clinical Progression and Cancer-specific Mortality in Node-positive Prostate Cancer Patients.', 'Stage T1-2 prostate cancer: a multivariate analysis of factors affecting biochemical and clinical failures after radical prostatectomy.', 'Current trend of worsening prognosis of prostate small cell carcinoma: A population-based study.', 'Incidental carcinoma of the prostate.', 'Primary small cell carcinoma of the esophagus: patient data metaanalysis and review of the literature.', 'Safety Analysis of Apatinib Combined with Chemotherapy in the Treatment of Advanced Gastric Carcinoma: A Randomised Controlled Trial.']"""

The biocompatibility at an organismal level was verified in a murine model by histological examination. A lipophilic bismuth nanoparticle hydrogel at 50 µM time-dependently inhibited the growth of the three cancer cell lines, in a time-dependent way. A 1-hour exposure to 250 µM lipophilic bismuth nanoparticle hydrogel, inhibited the growth of the three cancer cell lines. The in-vitro efficacy of lipophilic bismuth nanoparticle was similar to the one of docetaxel and cisplatin, but without inhibiting the growth of non-cancer control cells.

By understanding the mechanism(s) by which CAF contributes to tumor growth, new therapeutic targets for the management of this disease may be identified. These studies determined whether unique sub-populations of human prostate CAF can be identified and functionally characterized.  Methods:   Single-cell RNA-seq of primary human prostate CAF followed by unsupervised clustering was utilized to generate cell clusters based on differentially expressed (DE) gene profiles. Potential communication between CAF and immune cells was analyzed using in vivo tissue recombination by combining CAF or normal prostate fibroblasts (NPF) with non-tumorigenic, initiated prostate epithelial BPH-1 cells. Resultant grafts were assessed for inflammatory cell recruitment.  Results:   Clustering of 3321 CAF allows for visualization of six subpopulations, demonstrating heterogeneity within CAF. Sub-renal capsule recombination assays show that the presence of CAF significantly increases myeloid cell recruitment to resultant tumors. This is supported by significantly increased expression of chemotactic chemokines CCL2 and CXCL12 in large clusters compared to other subpopulations. Bayesian analysis topologies also support differential communication signals between chemokine-related genes of individual clusters. Migration of THP-1 monocyte cells in vitro is stimulated in the presence of CAF conditioned medium (CM) compared with NPF CM. Further in vitro analyses suggest that CAF-derived chemokine CCL2 may be responsible for CAF-stimulated migration of THP-1 cells, since neutralization of this chemokine abrogates migration capacity.  Conclusions:   CAF clustering based on DE gene expression supports the concept that clusters have unique functions within the TME, including a role in immune/inflammatory cell recruitment. These data suggest that CCL2 produced by CAF may be involved in the recruitment of inflammatory cells, but may also directly regulate the growth of the tumor. Further studies aimed at characterizing the subpopulation(s) of CAF which promote immune cell recruitment to the TME and/or stimulate prostate cancer growth and progression will be pursued.""","""['Renee E Vickman', 'Meaghan M Broman', 'Nadia A Lanman', 'Omar E Franco', 'Putu Ayu G Sudyanti', 'Yang Ni', 'Yuan Ji', 'Brian T Helfand', 'Jacqueline Petkewicz', 'Michael C Paterakos', 'Susan E Crawford', 'Timothy L Ratliff', 'Simon W Hayward']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Cancer-Associated Fibroblast Heterogeneity, Activation and Function: Implications for Prostate Cancer.', 'Loss of androgen receptor signaling in prostate cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) promotes CCL2- and CXCL8-mediated cancer cell migration.', 'Carcinoma associated fibroblasts (CAFs) promote breast cancer motility by suppressing mammalian Diaphanous-related formin-2 (mDia2).', 'Tumor-derived CXCL8 signaling augments stroma-derived CCL2-promoted proliferation and CXCL12-mediated invasion of PTEN-deficient prostate cancer cells.', 'Fibroblast heterogeneity in prostate carcinogenesis.', 'Engineering prostate cancer in vitro: what does it take?', 'Advances in landscape and related therapeutic targets of the prostate tumor microenvironment.', 'Single-cell omics traces the heterogeneity of prostate cancer cells and the tumor microenvironment.', 'Cancer-Associated Fibroblast: Role in Prostate Cancer Progression to Metastatic Disease and Therapeutic Resistance.', 'Cancer-Associated Fibroblast Heterogeneity, Activation and Function: Implications for Prostate Cancer.']"""

Materials and methods:   A total of 176 patients with suspicious lesions detected on multiparametric MRI (mpMRI) underwent a systematic modified Barzel template biopsy (12-core) transperineal biopsy (transperineal SBx) and transperineal TBx with EM tracking (UroNav; Philips Healthcare, Best, the Netherlands) in the same setting. Cancer detection rates (CDRs) were stratified by Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) v2 scores and compared with Fisher's exact test. Area under the curve (AUC) was calculated for prostate-specific antigen (PSA), PSA density (PSAD), PI-RADS score, and subgroup analysis of individual readers' PI-RADS scores with respect to overall CDR and clinically significant CDR.  Results:   The overall CDR was 76.7% (135/176), of which 76.3% (103/135) was clinically significant PCa. Among the 135 patients with PCa, transperineal TBx detected 90.4% of cases (122/135), either alone or in combination with transperineal SBx. The remaining 9.6% of cases (13/135) missed by transperineal TBx were diagnosed by transperineal SBx alone, of which three were clinically significant. Conversely, transperineal SBx missed 14% of cases (19/135), 14 of which were clinically significant PCa. Sensitivities for transperineal TBx and transperineal SBx were 90.4% and 85.9%, respectively. On a per-lesion basis, PI-RADS score (AUC 0.74) outperformed both PSA (AUC 0.59) and PSAD (AUC 0.63) in discriminating clinically significant from non-clinically significant PCa on transperineal TBx. Although not formally statistically tested, AUCs amongst different mpMRI readers appeared to display considerable variability. There were no adverse events, including sepsis.  Conclusions:   Electromagnetically tracked transperineal TBx of MRI-visible lesions enhanced the ability of transperineal SBx to detect PCa, with greater sensitivity for clinically significant disease. These findings suggest transperineal TBx is a safe, alternative fusion platform for patients with a suspicious lesion on prostate MRI.

Methods and results:   The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program was used to compare the US general population to 3 234 256 US cancer survivors (1973-2012). Standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) were calculated using coded cause of death from CVDs (heart disease, hypertension, cerebrovascular disease, atherosclerosis, and aortic aneurysm/dissection). Analyses were adjusted by age, race, and sex. Among 28 cancer types, 1 228 328 patients (38.0%) died from cancer and 365 689 patients (11.3%) died from CVDs. Among CVDs, 76.3% of deaths were due to heart disease. In eight cancer sites, CVD mortality risk surpassed index-cancer mortality risk in at least one calendar year. Cardiovascular disease mortality risk was highest in survivors diagnosed at <35 years of age. Further, CVD mortality risk is highest (SMR 3.93, 95% confidence interval 3.89-3.97) within the first year after cancer diagnosis, and CVD mortality risk remains elevated throughout follow-up compared to the general population.

We explored the effects of MYSM1 on cell proliferation, senescence and viability both in vitro and in vivo. Integrative database analyses and co-immunoprecipitation assays were performed to elucidate genomic association of MYSM1 and MYSM1-involved biological interaction network in PCa. We observed that MYSM1 were downregulated in CRPC compared to localized prostate tumors. Knockdown of MYSM1 promoted cell proliferation and suppressed senescence of CRPC cells under condition of androgen ablation. MYSM1 downregulation enhanced the tumorigenic ability in nude mice. Integrative bioinformatic analyses of the significantly associated genes with MYSM1 revealed MYSM1-correlated pathways, providing substantial clues as to the role of MYSM1 in PCa. MYSM1 was able to bind to androgen receptor instead of increasing its expression and knockdown of MYSM1 resulted in activation of Akt/c-Raf/GSK-3β signaling.

We tested the effect of marital status on the rate of nonorgan confined disease as well as on cancer-specific mortality (CSM) in patients who underwent radical cystectomy for nonmetastatic urothelial bladder cancer (UCUB).  Methods:   Within the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results database (2007-2015), we identified 11,167 patients (8,639 men and 2,528 women) who underwent radical cystectomy for nonmetastatic UCUB. Temporal trend analyses, logistic regression models, cumulative incidence plots, competing-risks regression models and landmark analyses were used.  Results:   Overall, 2,454 men (28.4%) and 1,363 women (53.9%) were unmarried. Unmarried men had a higher rate of nonorgan-confined disease at radical cystectomy (OR: 1.24, CI 1.10-1.33; P < 0.001).

The clinical utility of the Decipher test was evaluated prospectively on postoperative treatment decisions and patient-reported outcomes.  Methods and materials:   In the study, 246 eligible men across 19 centers were enrolled. Patients were dichotomized into those considering adjuvant or salvage radiation therapy (ART or SRT). Participating providers submitted a management recommendation before and after receiving the Decipher test results. Treatment received within 12 months and a validated survey on prostate cancer-related anxiety were collected longitudinally.  Results:   Pre-Decipher, treatment was recommended for 12% and 40% for the ART and SRT arms, respectively. Post-Decipher, 17% and 30% of treatment recommendations changed in the ART and SRT arms, respectively. Post-Decipher treatment recommendation was administered 78% and 76% of the time in the ART and SRT arms, respectively. Multivariable analysis confirmed that the Decipher score was an independent predictor for change in management for both adjuvant and salvage patients.

Materials and methods:   Forty-three patients with at least 1 PI-RADS 3 lesion on prostate MRI performed between June 2016 and January 2019 were retrospectively included. Reference standard was pathological analysis of radical prostatectomy specimens or MRI-targeted biopsies. Texture analysis extraction of target lesions was performed on axial T2-weighted images and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps using a radiomic software. Lesions were categorized as prostate cancer (Gleason score [GS] ≥ 6), and no prostate cancer. Statistical analysis was performed using the generalized linear model (GLM) regression and the discriminant analysis (DA). AUROC with 95% confidence intervals were calculated to assess the diagnostic performance of standalone features and predictive models for the diagnosis of prostate cancer (GS ≥ 6) and clinically-significant prostate cancer (GS ≥ 7).  Results:   The analysis of 46 PI-RADS 3 lesions (ie, 27 [58.7%] no prostate cancers; 19 [41.3%] prostate cancers) revealed 9 and 6 independent texture parameters significantly correlated with the final histopathological results on T2-weighted and ADC maps images, respectively. The resulting GLM and DA predictive models for the diagnosis of prostate cancer yielded an AUROC of 0.775 and 0.779 on T2-weighted images or 0.815 and 0.821 on ADC maps images. For the diagnosis of clinically-significant prostate cancer, the resulting GLM and DA predictive models for the diagnosis of prostate cancer yielded an AUROC of 0.769 and 0.817 on T2-weighted images or 0.749 and 0.744 on ADC maps images.

The probe uses a new self-immolative mechanism that can achieve a rapid response (within 10 min) to ALP, detected as a spectral shift (from 580 to 650 nm). This method effectively avoids issues related to instrument variability, and the near-infrared fluorescence emission (650 nm) makes it more suitable for biological detection. Moreover, the high sensitivity (14-fold enhancement of the fluorescence ratio F650/F580) and low detection limit (0.89 U L-1) for ALP allows the probe to be adapted to complex biological environments. The assay was successfully performed using serum samples with a linear range of ALP of up to 150 U L-1.

The dysfunction or mutation of lncRNAs are implicated in a wide range of diseases. An accurate computational model can benefit the diagnosis of diseases and help us to gain a better understanding of the molecular mechanism. Although many related algorithms have been proposed, there is still much room to improve the accuracy of the algorithm.  Results:   We developed a novel algorithm, BiWalkLDA, to predict disease-related lncRNAs in three real datasets, which have 528 lncRNAs, 545 diseases and 1216 interactions in total. To compare performance with other algorithms, the leave-one-out validation test was performed for BiWalkLDA and three other existing algorithms, SIMCLDA, LDAP and LRLSLDA. Additional tests were carefully designed to analyze the parameter effects such as α, β, l and r, which could help user to select the best choice of these parameters in their own application. In a case study of prostate cancer, eight out of the top-ten disease-related lncRNAs reported by BiWalkLDA were previously confirmed in literatures.  Conclusions:   In this paper, we develop an algorithm, BiWalkLDA, to predict lncRNA-disease association by using bi-random walks. It constructs a lncRNA-disease network by integrating interaction profile and gene ontology information. Solving cold-start problem by using neighbors' interaction profile information.

A major limitation of this modality is the lack of selectivity between cancerous and healthy tissues. One of the most promising strategies proposed in this last decade is the addition of nanoparticles with high-atomic number to enhance radiation effects in tumors. Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) are considered as one of the best candidates because of their high radioenhancing property, simple synthesis and low toxicity. Ultra small AuNPs (core size of 2.4 nm and hydrodynamic diameter of 4.5 nm) covered with dithiolated diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (Au@DTDTPA) are of high interest because of their properties to bind MRI active or PET active compounds at their surface, to concentrate in some tumors and be eliminated via renal clearance thanks to their small size. These key figures make Au@DTDTPA the best candidate to develop image-guided radiotherapy. Surprisingly the capacity of the nanoparticles to penetrate cells, an important issue to predict radioenhancement, has not been established yet. Here, we report the uptake dynamics, internalization routes and excretion dynamics of Au@DTDTPA nanoparticles in various cancer cell lines including glioblastoma (U87-MG), chordoma (UM-Chor1), cervix (HeLa), prostate (PC3), and pancreatic (BxPC-3) cell lines as well as fibroblasts (Dermal fibroblasts). This study demonstrates a strong cell line dependence of the nanoparticle uptake and excretion dynamics. Different pathways of cell internalization evidenced here explain this dependence. As a major finding, the retention of Au@DTDTPA nanoparticles was found to be higher in cancer cells than in fibroblasts. This result strengthens the strategy of using nanoagents to improve tumor selectivity of radiation treatments. In particular Au@DTDTPA nanoparticles are good candidates to improve the treatment of radioresitant gliobastoma, pancreatic and prostate cancer in particular. In conclusion, the variability of cell-to-nanoparticle interaction is a new parameter to consider in the choice of nanoagents in a combined treatment.""","""['Vladimir Ivošev', 'Gloria Jiménez Sánchez', 'Lenka Stefancikova', 'Darine Abi Haidar', 'César R González Vargas', 'Xiaomin Yang', 'Rana Bazzi', 'Erika Porcel', 'Stéphane Roux', 'Sandrine Lacombe']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Nanotechnology""","""['Preclinical evaluation of gold-DTDTPA nanoparticles as theranostic agents in prostate cancer radiotherapy.', 'Nanovacuums: nanoparticle uptake and differential cellular migration on a carpet of nanoparticles.', 'Radiosensitization with Gadolinium Chelate-Coated Gold Nanoparticles Prevents Aggressiveness and Invasiveness in Glioblastoma.', 'Radiosensitization by gold nanoparticles: Will they ever make it to the clinic?', 'Roadmap to Clinical Use of Gold Nanoparticles for Radiation Sensitization.', 'Peptide Targeted Gold Nanoplatform Carrying miR-145 Induces Antitumoral Effects in Ovarian Cancer Cells.', 'Gold Nanoparticles in Triple-Negative Breast Cancer Therapeutics.', 'Y2O3 Nanoparticles and X-ray Radiation-Induced Effects in Melanoma Cells.', 'Perspectives of gold nanoparticles and their applications in pancreatic cancer (Review).', 'Differential Effects of Gold Nanoparticles and Ionizing Radiation on Cell Motility between Primary Human Colonic and Melanocytic Cells and Their Cancerous Counterparts.']"""

In 2015, a number of machine learning and statistical models were benchmarked in the DREAM 9.5 Prostate Cancer Challenge, based on open clinical trial data for metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). However, applying these models into clinical practice poses a practical challenge due to the inclusion of a large number of model variables, some of which are not routinely monitored or are expensive to measure.  Objectives:   To develop cost-specified variable selection algorithms for constructing cost-effective prognostic models of overall survival that still preserve sufficient model performance for clinical decision making.  Methods:   Penalized Cox regression models were used for the survival prediction. For the variable selection, we implemented two algorithms: (i) LASSO regularization approach; and (ii) a greedy cost-specified variable selection algorithm. The models were compared in three cohorts of mCRPC patients from randomized clinical trials (RCT), as well as in a real-world cohort (RWC) of advanced prostate cancer patients treated at the Turku University Hospital. Hospital laboratory expenses were utilized as a reference for computing the costs of introducing new variables into the models.  Results:   Compared to measuring the full set of clinical variables, economic costs could be reduced by half without a significant loss of model performance.

Experiments have demonstrated that the intratumoral androgen levels are not affected by circulating androgen levels, but rather modulated by local steroid-converting enzyme activities. The expression modulation status of human steroid-converting enzymes and nuclear receptors are of great promise to identify novel therapeutic targets. Meta-analysis was performed with 9 cohorts (1093 specimens) from Gene Expression Omnibus, 16 cohorts (933 specimens) from Oncomine and the TCGA cohort (550 specimens). We found significant up regulation of 5α-reductase type 1 and type 3 in both primary and metastatic PC, together with the down regulation of AKR1C2 in primary PC, contributing to the high intratumoral DHT levels. The expression of AR in metastatic PC was up regulated, indicating the importance of AR signaling in the progression of this cancer. The down regulations of HSD11B1 and NR3C1 in primary and metastatic PC may diminish the anti-inflammation and anti-proliferation effects of glucocorticoids signaling. Furthermore, the decrease of progesterone receptor (PGR) expression in primary and metastatic PC was also observed, relieving the suppression effect of PGR on PC proliferation.

However, much of Gartanin's anticancer mechanism remains unknown. We have discovered that Gartanin docked onto the regulatory subunit of the precursor cell-expressed developmentally downregulated 8 (NEDD8)-activating enzyme (NAE) complex and next to the NEDD8 binding complex, which leads to inhibit NEDD8 conjugations to both Cullin1 and Ubc12 in prostate cancer cell lines and Ubc12 NEDDylation in an in vitro assay. The S phase kinase-associated protein (Skp2) and F-box and WD-repeat domain-containing 2 (FBXW2), the NEDD8 family members of E3 ubiqutin ligases, were also downregulated and upregulated by Gartainin, respectively. Knock-down of NEDD8 expression by short harpin (Sh) RNAs blocked or attenuated these effects of Gartainin.

Human amniotic membrane (HAM) can improve tissue regeneration and functional outcome after RP owing to the growth factors and unique immune tolerance. Preliminary studies showed the potential value of HAM in the reconstruction of the urinary tract and nerve protection during RP.  Methods:   A protocol is developed for a prospective, randomized, single-blind, single-surgeon, placebo-controlled exploration study of the efficacy and safety of dehydrated human amnion membrane placed around the neurovascular bundle (NVB) and vesicourethral anastomosis (VUA) during RP for the treatment of localized prostate cancer. Eligible for inclusion are patients with localized prostate cancer, requiring a surgical procedure and exclusion of preoperative incontinence and erectile dysfunction. The patients are randomized 1:1 to HAM vs. placebo and blinded during the study period. According to the T test with an alpha of 0.05 and a power of 80% and expecting a dropout of 20% of the patients, an adjusted sample size per arm of 164 patients is required.  Planned outcomes:   The primary outcome is a postoperative continence measured as 24-h pad test up to 12 months postoperatively. Secondary outcomes are potency, time of postoperative catheter removal, postoperative complications, and biochemical recurrence. The protocol for this randomized exploration study defines the conditions to assess the efficacy and safety of HAM application during RP in order to improve the postoperative functional outcome.

Here, we aimed to estimate the results of PSMA-RLT in terms of response, progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS) in patients receiving a highly standardized treatment regimen due to mCRPC. The toxicity of PSMA-RLT has also been evaluated.  Patients and methods:   Fifty-four patients (mean age 72 ± 7 years, median PSA at time of initial therapy 66 [range 1.0-4890 μg/L]), receiving three PSMA-RLT cycles (mean 7315 ± 573 MBq) at four weekly intervals, were included in this retrospective analysis. Hematological and biochemical parameters were regularly determined in every patient. Kaplan-Meier estimates were used to assess PFS and OS and a Cox proportional hazard model was used to analyze significant associations. Treatment response was based on PSA measurements 4 weeks after the 3rd treatment.  Results:   The majority of patients were previously treated with abiraterone/enzalutamide (69%) and docetaxel/cabazitaxel (67%). In total, 79% of the patients showed a decrease in PSA (median PSA decrease from 66 to 19.8, range 0.7-4563 μg/L, P < 0.001) 1 month after the 3rd therapy cycle. Among them, 58% and 35% demonstrated a PSA-decline of > 50% and > 80%, respectively. Median OS was 119 weeks; median PFS was 25 weeks. Patients presenting with a PSA decline had significantly longer PFS (27 vs. 15 weeks, P < 0.0001) and OS (median survival not reached vs. 52 weeks, P < 0.001) than patients with no PSA reduction. Moreover, patients with reduction in PSA levels ≥ 50% (median survival not reached vs. 52 weeks, P < 0.0001) and ≥ 80% (median survival not reached vs. 87 weeks, P = 0.008) lived significantly longer. While hemoglobin did not change during treatment, levels of platelets (236 ± 71 g/L vs. 193 ± 67 g/L) and leucocytes (6.5, range 2.9-13.7 g/L vs. 4.8, range 1.5-12.3 g/L) decreased significantly, both P < 0.001.

Given loss of basal cells being the hallmark of iPCa, we hypothesized that a subset of these atypical intraepithelial lesions (AILs) with sparse basal cells can be classified as prostatic intraepithelial carcinoma (PIC) with frequent iPCa association and that different morphologic patterns of PIC are associated with specific Gleason (G) patterns and scores for iPCa.  Methods:   We stratified 153 foci of AILs from 110 patients based on the integrity of the basal cell layer and architectural patterns and their association with iPCa.  Results:   We demonstrated that AILs could be stratified into usual HPIN (intact basal cell layer and simple patterns) with low-risk of iPCa association and PIC (sparse basal cell layer) with high risk of iPCa association. Furthermore, PIC could be divided into low-grade (simple patterns and associated with G3 and G3/4 iPCa) and high-grade PIC (complex patterns and associated with G4 and G3/4/5 iPCa).

The NLR can be easily calculated from routine complete blood counts in the peripheral blood. This parameter has been reported to be an independent prognosticator for some solid malignancies. In the present study, we examined the importance of the NLR as a prognostic marker for castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) patients who received docetaxel- (DOC-) based chemotherapy.  Methods:   We analyzed a total of 73 patients who received DOC chemotherapy for CRPC in Yokohama City University Medical Center and affiliated hospitals. Complete blood cell counts were performed, and the NLR was calculated using the neutrophil and lymphocyte counts obtained on the same day or a few days before the initiation of DOC chemotherapy. We determined the NLR cutoff value based on the sensitivity and specificity levels derived from area under the receiver operator characteristic curves for death.  Results:   The median overall survival (OS) after DOC was 21.0 months (range: 2.0-51.0). The median OS was shorter in patients with a high NLR (≥2.59) than in those with a low NLR (<2.59) (12.0 versus 31.6 months, p=0.001).

Methods:   We prospectively enrolled 40 consecutive patients after radical treatment (80%-radical prostatectomy, 20%-radiation beam therapy) of PCa and low (0.008 to ≤2.0 ng/ml), rising PSA. Skull to mid-thigh PET/CT imaging was performed 95 (±12) min after injection of 295.5 (±14.1) MBq 18F-PSMA-1007. Detection rate was correlated with PSA levels, Gleason score (GS) and T stage ≥ 3. PET/CT results were verified during 10.3 (±4.7) months follow-up to calculate sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive values (NPV) and positive predictive values (PPV).  Results:   18F-PSMA-1007 PET/CT was positive in 24/40 patients, which yielded overall detection rate of 60%. Detection rate was 39%, 55% and 100% for PSA < 0.5, 0.5 to <1.0 and 1.0 to ≤2.0 ng/ml, respectively. PET/CT showed metastases in locoregional lymph nodes in 55% of patients, bones in 36% of patients and local recurrence in 9% of patients. Detection rate was correlated with PSA-a 0.1 ng/ml rise in PSA level increased odds for positive PET/CT by ~30%. PET/CT positivity was independent of GS and T stage.

We retrospectively reviewed our TRUS/MRI fusion biopsy database (n = 706). Eighty (11.3%) patients who had used 5-ARI for more than one year at the time of biopsy were stratified as 5-ARI group. Subsequently, we performed comparative analyses of 5-ARI and non-5-ARI groups. csPCa was defined by a Gleason score ≥3 + 4 in a single biopsy core. Chi-squared test was used to evaluate the performance of mpMRI in predicting PCa/csPCa between the two groups. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to evaluate the significant variables associated with PCa detection. There were no significant differences in PCa/csPCa detection rates between 5-ARI and non-5-ARI groups (all, P > 0.05).

We investigated the impact of deep neuromuscular block and its reversal on postoperative shoulder pain and outcomes after robotic prostate surgery.  Methods:   Elderly men undergoing robotic prostatectomy were randomised to deep neuromuscular block (target post-tetanic twitch of 1-2 at the facial nerve) with sugammadex reversal or moderate neuromuscular block (target 1-2 train-of-four ratio) with neostigmine reversal. The primary endpoint was postoperative shoulder pain. The secondary endpoints included intraoperative insufflation pressure, surgical rating score, incidence of residual neuromuscular block, and postoperative recovery.  Results:   A total of 50 subjects for each treatment arm were included in the analysis. The degree of neuromuscular block had no effect on the incidence of shoulder pain (deep block group 12% vs moderate block group 10%; P=1.0) or average insufflation pressure (median [inter-quartile range]) (13.3 [12.5-13.6] mm Hg vs 13.3 [11.7-14] mm Hg, P=0.86). After surgery, the deep block group had a higher normalised train-of-four ratio (0.98 [0.79-1.11] vs 0.85 [0.74-1.00]; P=0.008). The presence of postoperative shoulder pain was associated with higher BMI (31.8 [28-33.9] kg m-2vs 28 [24.8-31.1] kg m-2; P=0.036) and longer insufflation time (186 [156-257] min vs 154 [126-198] min; P=0.028).

Therefore, we decided to detect the expression level of FKBP9 in PCa and explore its clinical significance.  Methods:   The expression level of FKBP9 protein was detected by immunohistochemistry. In addition, it was demonstrated by high-throughput sequencing of mRNA levels in the TCGA (cancer genome atlas) dataset of 499 patients. Kaplan-meier analysis and Cox proportional hazard regression model were used to evaluate the relationship between FKBP9 expression and survival in prostate cancer patients.  Results:   The expression of FKBP9 was localized in the cytoplasm, which in normal prostate tissues was obviously lower than that in PCa tissues (P = 0.001). High expression of FKBP9 was related with lymph node metastasis (P = 0.022) and distant metastasis (P = 0.028). Kaplan-Meier survival analysis revealed that the BCR-free survival of PCa patients with high FKBP9 level was significantly shortened (P=0.041).

To optimize the maintenance of such populations during the in vitro preparation process, we explored the impact of T cell exposure to both traditional [fetal bovine serum (FBS), human AB serum (ABS)] and non-traditional [human platelet lysate (HPL) - a xeno-free protein supplement primarily used for the production of clinical grade mesenchymal stromal / stem cells (MSCs)] serum supplements.  Methods:   Second generation chimeric antigen receptor with CD28 and CD3ζ endodomain targeting prostate stem cell antigen (PSCA) (P28z) or CD19 (1928z) were constructed and used for this study. After retroviral transduction, CAR T cells were divided into 3 conditions containing either FBS, ABS or HPL and expanded for 7 days. To evaluate the effect of different sera on CAR T cell function, we performed a series of in vitro and in vivo experiments.  Results:   HPL-exposed CAR T cells exhibited the less differentiated T cell phenotype and gene signature, which displayed inferior short-term killing abilities (compared to their FBS- or ABS-cultured counterparts) but superior proliferative and anti-tumor effects in long-term in vitro coculture experiments.

In previous work, genome-wide DNA methylation profiling identified altered regions in the normal prostate tissue of men with PC. In the current multicenter study, we examined the predictive strength of a panel of loci to detect cancer presence and grade in patients with negative biopsy tissue.  Results:   Four centers contributed benign prostate biopsy tissues blocks from 129 subjects that were either tumor associated (TA, Grade Group [GG] ≥ 2, n = 77) or non-tumor associated (NTA, n = 52). Biopsies were analyzed using pyrosequencing for DNA methylation encompassing CpG loci near CAV1, EVX1, FGF1, NCR2, PLA2G16, and SPAG4 and methylation differences were detected within all gene regions (p < 0.05). A multiplex regression model for biomarker performance incorporating a gene combination discriminated TA from NTA tissues (area under the curve [AUC] 0.747, p = 0.004). A multiplex model incorporating all the above genes and clinical information (PSA, age) identified patients with GG ≥ 2 PC (AUC 0.815, p < 0.0001). In patients with cancer, increased variation in gene methylation levels occurs between biopsies across the prostate.  Conclusions:   A widespread epigenetic field defect is utilized to detect GG ≥ 2 PC in patients with histologically negative biopsies. These alterations in non-tumor cells display increased heterogeneity of methylation extent and are spatially distant from tumor foci. These findings have the potential to decrease the need for repeated prostate biopsy.""","""['Bing Yang', 'Tyler Etheridge', 'Johnathon McCormick', 'Adam Schultz', 'Tariq A Khemees', 'Nathan Damaschke', 'Glen Leverson', 'Kaitlin Woo', 'Geoffrey A Sonn', 'Eric A Klein', 'Mike Fumo', 'Wei Huang', 'David F Jarrard']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Clin Epigenetics""","""['Screening of urine identifies PLA2G16 as a field defect methylation biomarker for prostate cancer detection.', 'Using the epigenetic field defect to detect prostate cancer in biopsy negative patients.', 'Methylation profiling defines an extensive field defect in histologically normal prostate tissues associated with prostate cancer.', 'The expanding role of epigenetics in the development, diagnosis and treatment of prostate cancer and benign prostatic hyperplasia.', 'Epigenetic targets in the diagnosis and treatment of prostate cancer.', 'High Keratin-7 Expression in Benign Peri-Tumoral Prostatic Glands Is Predictive of Bone Metastasis Onset and Prostate Cancer-Specific Mortality.', 'Epigenetic field alterations in non-tumor prostate tissues detect prostate cancer in urine.', 'How to Better Understand the Influence of Host Genetics on Developing an Effective Immune Response to Thoracic Cancers.', 'PUMA and NOXA Expression in Tumor-Associated Benign Prostatic Epithelial Cells Are Predictive of Prostate Cancer Biochemical Recurrence.']"""

The Veterans Health Administration (VA) operates the largest integrated health care system in the United States and offers certain advantages to possibly improve medication adherence. We aimed to determine adherence to weekly alendronate for osteoporosis in Veterans, and investigate predictors and outcomes related to adherence. Methods: A retrospective study cohort was generated from VA databases selecting Veterans who were treated with weekly alendronate. Adherence was measured by medication possession ratio (MPR) and persistence. Two groups were defined as low and high adherence based on MPR <80% or ≥80%, respectively. Regression models were used to investigate predictors of adherence and included clinically relevant covariates. Further regressions were used to investigate the impact of adherence on change in bone mineral density measured by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry and incident fracture. Results: In a cohort of 913 (female/male, 207/706) Veterans, 48% had high adherence in year 1. Distribution for gender, race, and age were similar between the 2 groups, MPR <80% or MPR ≥80%. Baseline fracture [odds ratio OR: 0.64, 95%CI: (0.41, 0.98)], alcohol abuse [0.40 (0.21, 0.74)] and tobacco use [0.44 (0.31, 0.63)] were associated with low adherence in the unadjusted analyses, but only tobacco use [0.45 (0.30, 0.67)] was associated with low adherence after adjustment. Among males, tobacco use was associated with low adherence while prostate cancer predicted high adherence in adjusted models. High adherence was associated with a 30% [hazard ratio HR: 0.70, 95% CI: (0.47, 1.03)] decreased risk of incident fracture in the whole cohort, and a 40% [0.60 (0.38, 0.95)] decrease risk in males.

Methods:   This study included 206 patients with 262 prospectively called mpMRI prostate imaging reporting and data system 3-5 PZ lesions. Gleason scores > 6 were defined as CS PCa. Features were extracted with an auto-fixed 12-mm spherical VOI placed around a pin point in each lesion. The value of dynamic contrast-enhanced imaging(DCE), multivariate feature selection and extreme gradient boosting (XGB) vs. univariate feature selection and random forest (RF), expert-based feature pre-selection, and the addition of image filters was investigated using the training (171 lesions) and test (91 lesions) datasets.  Results:   The best model with features from T2-weighted (T2-w) + diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) + DCE had an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.870 (95% CI 0.980-0.754). Removal of DCE features decreased AUC to 0.816 (95% CI 0.920-0.710), although not significantly (p = 0.119). Multivariate and XGB outperformed univariate and RF (p = 0.028). Expert-based feature pre-selection and image filters had no significant contribution.  Conclusions:   The phenotype of CS PZ PCa lesions can be quantified using a radiomics approach based on features extracted from T2-w + DWI using an auto-fixed VOI. Although DCE features improve diagnostic performance, this is not statistically significant. Multivariate feature selection and XGB should be preferred over univariate feature selection and RF. The developed model may be a valuable addition to traditional visual assessment in diagnosing CS PZ PCa.  Key points:   • T2-weighted and diffusion-weighted imaging features are essential components of a radiomics model for clinically significant prostate cancer; addition of dynamic contrast-enhanced imaging does not significantly improve diagnostic performance. • Multivariate feature selection and extreme gradient outperform univariate feature selection and random forest. • The developed radiomics model that extracts multiparametric MRI features with an auto-fixed volume of interest may be a valuable addition to visual assessment in diagnosing clinically significant prostate cancer.""","""['Jeroen Bleker', 'Thomas C Kwee', 'Rudi A J O Dierckx', 'Igle Jan de Jong', 'Henkjan Huisman', 'Derya Yakar']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Eur Radiol""","""['Comparison of machine learning algorithms to predict clinically significant prostate cancer of the peripheral zone with multiparametric MRI using clinical assessment categories and radiomic features.', 'Comparison of biparametric and multiparametric MRI in the diagnosis of prostate cancer.', 'A deep learning masked segmentation alternative to manual segmentation in biparametric MRI prostate cancer radiomics.', 'Multiparametric MRI in detection and staging of prostate cancer.', 'Emerging MR methods for improved diagnosis of prostate cancer by multiparametric MRI.', 'Differences in the pathogenetic characteristics of prostate cancer in the transitional and peripheral zones and the possible molecular biological mechanisms.', 'Performance variability of radiomics machine learning models for the detection of clinically significant prostate cancer in heterogeneous MRI datasets.', 'A review of artificial intelligence in prostate cancer detection on imaging.', 'Predicting Local Failure after Partial Prostate Re-Irradiation Using a Dosiomic-Based Machine Learning Model.', 'Radiomic Machine Learning and External Validation Based on 3.0 T mpMRI for Prediction of Intraductal Carcinoma of Prostate With Different Proportion.']"""

Methods:   On the basis of PSMA-targeted 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT, 32 consecutive mCRPC patients were selected for 177Lu-PSMA-617 therapy (6 GBq/cycle, 2 to 6 cycles, 6-10 weeks apart) and followed until death. Post-therapy whole-body (WB) dosimetry and 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT data were compared and related to progression free and overall survival.  Results: 177Lu-PSMA-617 dosimetry after the first cycle indicated high tumor doses for skeletal (4.01 ± 2.64; range 1.10-13.00 Gy/GBq), lymph node (3.12 ± 2.07; range 0.70-8.70 Gy/GBq), and liver (2.97 ± 1.38; range 0.76-5.00 Gy/GBq) metastases whereas the dose for tissues/organs was acceptable in all patients for an intention-to-treat activity of 24 GBq. Any PSA decrease after the first cycle was found in 23/32 (72%), after the second cycle in 22/32 (69%), after the third cycle in 16/28 (57%), and after the fourth cycle in 8/18 (44%) patients. Post-therapy 24 h WB scintigraphy showed decreased tumor-to-background ratios in 24/32 (75%) after the first therapy cycle, after the second cycle in 17/29 (59%), and after the third cycle in 13/21 (62%) patients. The median PFS was 7 months and the median OS 12 months. In the group of PSA responders (n = 22) the median OS was 17 months versus 11 months in the group of non-responders (n = 10), p < 0.05. Decreasing SUVmax values were found for parotid (15.93 ± 6.23 versus 12.33 ± 4.07) and submandibular glands (17.65 ± 7.34 versus 13.12 ± 4.62) following treatment, along with transient (n = 6) or permanent (n = 2) xerostomia in 8/32 (25%) patients. In 3/32 patients, nephrotoxicity changed from Grade 2 to 3, whereas neither Grade 4 nephrotoxicity nor hematotoxicity was found. In most patients a good agreement was observed for the visual interpretation of the tracer accumulation between 24 h WB and PET/CT scans. However, no significance could be calculated for baseline-absorbed tumor doses and SUVmax values of tumor lesions. 5/32 (16%) patients showed a mixed response pattern, which resulted in disease progression over time.  Conclusion:   Serial PSA measurements and post-therapy 24 h WB scintigraphy seems to allow a sufficiently accurate follow-up of 177Lu-PSMA-617-treated mCRPC patients whereas 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT should be performed for patient selection and final response assessment.""","""['Johanna Maffey-Steffan', 'Lorenza Scarpa', 'Anna Svirydenka', 'Bernhard Nilica', 'Christian Mair', 'Sabine Buxbaum', 'Jasmin Bektic', 'Elisabeth von Guggenberg', 'Christian Uprimny', 'Wolfgang Horninger', 'Irene Virgolini']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Eur J Nucl Med Mol Imaging""","""['Correction to: The 68Ga/177Lu-theragnostic concept in PSMA-targeting of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer: impact of post-therapeutic whole-body scintigraphy in the follow-up.', 'The 68Ga/177Lu theragnostic concept in PSMA targeting of castration-resistant prostate cancer: correlation of SUVmax values and absorbed dose estimates.', 'Radiation Dosimetry for 177Lu-PSMA I&T in Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer: Absorbed Dose in Normal Organs and Tumor Lesions.', 'Examining Absorbed Doses of Indigenously Developed 177Lu-PSMA-617 in Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer Patients at Baseline and During Course of Peptide Receptor Radioligand Therapy.', 'Therapeutic Responses and Survival Effects of 177Lu-PSMA-617 Radioligand Therapy in Metastatic Castrate-Resistant Prostate Cancer: A Meta-analysis.', 'Hematologic toxicity profile and efficacy of 225AcAc-PSMA-617 α-radioligand therapy of patients with extensive skeletal metastases of castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Advances in PET imaging of cancer.', 'Joint EANM/SNMMI procedure guideline for the use of 177Lu-labeled PSMA-targeted radioligand-therapy (177Lu-PSMA-RLT).', 'Development of 177LuLu-LNC1003 for radioligand therapy of prostate cancer with a moderate level of PSMA expression.', 'Pharmacological Optimization of PSMA-Based Radioligand Therapy.', 'Theragnostic Radionuclide Pairs for Prostate Cancer Management: 64Cu/67Cu, Can Be a Budding Hot Duo.']"""

Gain-of-function mutations of MyD88 constitutively activate downstream NF-κB signaling pathways, resulting in increased cellular proliferation and survival. However, whether MyD88 activity can be aberrantly regulated in MyD88-wild-type lymphoid malignancies remains poorly understood. SPOP is an adaptor protein of CUL3-based E3 ubiquitin ligase complex and frequently mutated genes in prostate and endometrial cancers. In this study, we reveal that SPOP binds to and induces the nondegradative ubiquitination of MyD88 by recognizing an atypical SPOP-binding motif in MyD88. This modification blocks Myddosome assembly and downstream NF-κB activation. SPOP is mutated in a subset of lymphoid malignancies, including diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Lymphoid malignancies-associated SPOP mutants exhibited impaired binding to MyD88 and suppression of NF-κB activation. The DLBCL-associated, SPOP-binding defective mutants of MyD88 escaped from SPOP-mediated ubiquitination, and their effect on NF-κB activation is stronger than that of wild-type MyD88. Moreover, SPOP suppresses DLBCL cell growth in vitro and tumor xenograft in vivo by inhibiting the MyD88/NF-κB signaling. Therefore, SPOP acts as a tumor suppressor in DLBCL. Mutations in the SPOP-MyD88 binding interface may disrupt the SPOP-MyD88 regulatory axis and promote aberrant MyD88/NF-κB activation and cell growth in DLCBL.""","""['Xiaofeng Jin#', 'Qing Shi#', 'Qian Li', 'Linyi Zhou', 'Jian Wang', 'Lei Jiang', 'Xiaying Zhao', 'Kai Feng', 'Ting Lin', 'Zihan Lin', 'Hui Zhuang', 'Jianye Yang', 'Chongke Hu', 'Luyi Zhang', 'Liliang Shen', 'Ying Lu', 'Jie Zhu', 'Haibiao Wang', 'Honggang Qi', 'Xiaodan Meng', 'Yang Xi', 'Jinchang Pan', 'Shuai Fang', 'Haihua Tian', 'Chengwei Zhou', 'Pingzhao Zhang', 'Kun Gao', 'Shi-Min Zhao', 'Yao Li', 'Zhaohui Gong', 'Chenji Wang']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Leukemia""","""['Aberrant SPOP-CHAF1A ubiquitination axis triggers tumor autophagy that endows a therapeutical vulnerability in diffuse large B cell lymphoma.', 'HSP110 sustains chronic NF-κB signaling in activated B-cell diffuse large B-cell lymphoma through MyD88 stabilization.', 'SPOP-mediated ubiquitination and degradation of PDK1 suppresses AKT kinase activity and oncogenic functions.', 'The emerging role of SPOP protein in tumorigenesis and cancer therapy.', 'The ubiquitin ligase adaptor SPOP in cancer.', 'Cul3 substrate adaptor SPOP targets Nup153 for degradation.', 'Bioinformatics Analysis of miRNAs Targeting TRAF5 in DLBCL Involving in NF-κB Signaling Pathway and Affecting the Apoptosis and Signal Transduction.', 'O-GlcNAcylation of SPOP promotes carcinogenesis in hepatocellular carcinoma.', 'SPOP inhibits BRAF-dependent tumorigenesis through promoting non-degradative ubiquitination of BRAF.', 'SPOP mutations promote tumor immune escape in endometrial cancer via the IRF1-PD-L1 axis.']"""

Finasteride is currently not being used routinely as a chemoprevention agent but the long term outcomes of the PCPT trial are awaited. The outcomes of the SELECT trial have not recommended the use of chemoprevention in preventing prostate cancer. This study investigated whether germline risk SNPs could be used to predict outcomes in the PCPT and SELECT trial.  Methods:   Genotyping was performed in European men entered into the PCPT trial (n = 2434) and SELECT (n = 4885). Next generation genotyping was performed using Affymetrix® Eureka™ Genotyping protocols. Logistic regression models were used to test the association of risk scores and the outcomes in the PCPT and SELECT trials.  Results:   Of the 100 SNPs, 98 designed successfully and genotyping was validated for samples genotyped on other platforms. A number of SNPs predicted for aggressive disease in both trials. Men with a higher polygenic score are more likely to develop prostate cancer in both trials, but the score did not predict for other outcomes in the trial.

We previously reported the beneficial effects of the glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist exendin-4 against prostate and breast cancer. In the present study, we examined the anti-cancer effect of the sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor ipragliflozin using a breast cancer model. In human breast cancer MCF-7 cells, SGLT2 expression was detected using both RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry. Ipragliflozin at 1-50 μM significantly and dose-dependently suppressed the growth of MCF-7 cells. BrdU assay also revealed that ipragliflozin attenuated the proliferation of MCF-7 cells in a dose-dependent manner. Because the effect of ipragliflozin against breast cancer cells was completely canceled by knocking down SGLT2, ipragliflozin could act via inhibiting SGLT2. We next measured membrane potential and whole-cell current using the patch clamp technique. When we treated MCF-7 cells with ipragliflozin or glucose-free medium, membrane hyperpolarization was observed. In addition, glucose-free medium and knockdown of SGLT2 by siRNA suppressed the glucose-induced whole-cell current of MCF-7 cells, suggesting that ipragliflozin inhibits sodium and glucose cotransport through SGLT2. Furthermore, JC-1 green fluorescence was significantly increased by ipragliflozin, suggesting the change of mitochondrial membrane potential. These findings suggest that the SGLT2 inhibitor ipragliflozin attenuates breast cancer cell proliferation via membrane hyperpolarization and mitochondrial membrane instability.""","""['Shiho Komatsu', 'Takashi Nomiyama', 'Tomohiro Numata', 'Takako Kawanami', 'Yuriko Hamaguchi', 'Chikayo Iwaya', 'Tsuyoshi Horikawa', 'Yuki Fujimura-Tanaka', 'Nobuya Hamanoue', 'Ryoko Motonaga', 'Makito Tanabe', 'Ryuji Inoue', 'Toshihiko Yanase', 'Daiji Kawanami']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Endocr J""","""['In Vitro Pharmacological Profile of Ipragliflozin, a Sodium Glucose Co-transporter 2 Inhibitor.', 'The Sodium Glucose Cotransporter 2 Inhibitor Ipragliflozin Promotes Preferential Loss of Fat Mass in Non-obese Diabetic Goto-Kakizaki Rats.', 'Susceptibility to serious skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders and skin tissue distribution of sodium-dependent glucose co-transporter type 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors.', 'Ipragliflozin and other sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors in the treatment of type 2 diabetes: preclinical and clinical data.', 'Sodium glucose CoTransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors: Current status and future perspective.', 'SGLT2 Inhibitors as Potential Anticancer Agents.', 'SGLT1 as an adverse prognostic factor in invasive ductal carcinoma of the breast.', 'Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors versus dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitors on new-onset overall cancer in Type 2 diabetes mellitus: A population-based study.', 'Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors and mitochondrial functions: state of the art.', 'Potential Therapies Targeting the Metabolic Reprogramming of Diabetes-Associated Breast Cancer.']"""

However, the use for screening purposes has a controversial benefit and potential harms can occur due to false-positive results, overdiagnosis and overtreatment. The objective of this study is to calculate the prevalence and identify factors associated with the receipt of DRE in Brazilian men.  Methods:   We selected men older than 40 from a nationwide population-based survey (13,625 individuals) excluding those with prostate cancer diagnosis. Information was extracted from the most recent database of the Brazilian National Health Survey (PNS 2013). Statistical analysis was carried out to calculate incidence rate ratios, with 95% confidence intervals and p values, through multivariate analysis with Poisson regression and robust variance.  Results:   Men having private health insurance (63.3%; CI = 60.5-66.0) presented higher prevalence of DRE than those in the public health system (41.6%; CI = 39.8-43.4). The results show a positive association between DRE and men having private health insurance, aged 60-69, living with a spouse, never smokers, and living in urban areas. Among public health services users, this positive association was observed among men aged 70-79, living with a spouse, having bad/very bad health self-perception, abstainers, ex-smokers, with undergraduate studies, presenting four or more comorbidities, and residing in urban areas.

Bone metastasis is common, and bone marrow metastasis occurs later in the disease course. The median survival in these patients after bone marrow involvement is less than six months. We report a case of castrate-resistant prostate cancer patient presented with severe pancytopenia due to bone marrow involvement of prostate cancer, treated successfully with docetaxel chemotherapy. Post chemotherapy, the patient became transfusion independent and prostate-specific antigen improved to 0.1 ng/ml from 1051 ng/ml.  Case report:   A 70-year-old gentleman with a history of metastatic prostate cancer on androgen deprivation therapy and polycythemia vera presented to emergency room with dizziness and melena. Workup revealed severe pancytopenia with platelet count of 12k and hemoglobin of 4.5 gm/dl. Bone marrow biopsy confirmed diffuse involvement of bone marrow with prostate cancer. Prostate-specific antigen was 1051 gm/dl. Management and outcome: The patient received 14 units of packed red blood cell, 10 units of platelet transfusion within one week. Docetaxel chemotherapy was started along with thrombopoietin agonist romiplostim and pegylated filgrastim. He received five cycles of docetaxel treatment. Post chemotherapy, the patient became transfusion independent and prostate-specific antigen improved to 1.17 ng/ml from 1051 ng/ml. The patient is still alive one year after the presentation with good quality of life and the prostate-specific antigen further improved to 0.1 ng/dl.  Conclusion:   This case suggests that selected patients with severe pancytopenia, due to bone marrow infiltration of prostate cancer, can be treated with docetaxel chemotherapy and romiplostim support with significant response.

TDP2 is a logical target for the development of therapeutics to complement existing treatments based on inhibition of TOP2. There is, however, no TDP2 inhibitor in clinical development at present. Of the reported TDP2 inhibitors, the deazaflavins are the most promising chemical class centered around the lead compound SV-5-153. Recently we reported new subtypes derived within the deazaflavin family with improved membrane permeability properties. In this work we characterize two representative analogues from two new deazaflavin subtypes based on their biochemical TDP2 inhibitory potency and drug-likeness. We demonstrate that the ZW-1288 derivative represents a promising direction for the development of deazaflavins as therapeutic agents. ZW-1288 exhibits potent inhibitory activity at low nanomolar concentrations against recombinant and cellular human TDP2 with profile similar to that of the parent analog SV-5-153 based on high resistance against murine TDP2 and human TDP2 mutated at residue L313H. While expressing weak cytotoxicity on its own, ZW-1288 potentiates the clinical TOP2 inhibitors etoposide (ETP) and mitoxantrone in human prostate DU145 and CCRF-CEM leukemia and chicken lymphoma DT40 cells while not impacting the activity of the topoisomerase I (TOP1) inhibitor camptothecin or the PARP inhibitor olaparib. ZW-1288 increases the uptake of ETP to a lesser extent than SV-5-153 and remained active in TDP2 knockout cells indicating that the deazaflavin TDP2 inhibitors have additional cellular effects that will have to be taken into account for their further development as TDP2 inhibitors.""","""['Evgeny Kiselev', 'Azhar Ravji', 'Jayakanth Kankanala', 'Jiashu Xie', 'Zhengqiang Wang', 'Yves Pommier']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""DNA Repair (Amst)""","""['Novel Deazaflavin Analogues Potently Inhibited Tyrosyl DNA Phosphodiesterase 2 (TDP2) and Strongly Sensitized Cancer Cells toward Treatment with Topoisomerase II (TOP2) Poison Etoposide.', 'Deazaflavin Inhibitors of TDP2 with Cellular Activity Can Affect Etoposide Influx and/or Efflux.', 'Deazaflavin Inhibitors of Tyrosyl-DNA Phosphodiesterase 2 (TDP2) Specific for the Human Enzyme and Active against Cellular TDP2.', 'Tyrosyl-DNA phosphodiesterase inhibitors: Progress and potential.', 'Tyrosyl-DNA Phosphodiesterase 1 (Tdp1) inhibitors.', 'Repair of topoisomerase 1-induced DNA damage by tyrosyl-DNA phosphodiesterase 2 (TDP2) is dependent on its magnesium binding.', 'Cell-free circulating tumor RNAs in plasma as the potential prognostic biomarkers in colorectal cancer.', 'The synthesis of furoquinolinedione and isoxazoloquinolinedione derivatives as selective Tyrosyl-DNA phosphodiesterase 2 (TDP2) inhibitors.', '4-Benzylideneisoquinoline-1,3(2H,4H)-diones as tyrosyl DNA phosphodiesterase 2 (TDP2) inhibitors.', 'Exonuclease VII repairs quinolone-induced damage by resolving DNA gyrase cleavage complexes.']"""

In African men, however, prostate cancer tends to follow a more aggressive course when compared to their European counterparts. This is attributed to a plethora of diverse factors of which an underlying genetic component has been shown to be an important aspect. Such differences highlight the need for individualised therapy and for local guidelines. The aim of this guideline is to aid nuclear physicians and other clinicians who manage patients with prostate cancer in the correct identification and treatment of patients who are likely to benefit from receptor radioligand therapy.  Recommendations:   There are a multitude of treatment modalities available for the treatment of prostate cancer and these therapies may be required at various time points during the course of the disease in any individual patient. A multidisciplinary approach is crucial in deciding which therapy, or combination of therapies, would be most advantageous at particular time points. The multidisciplinary team should include a urologist, oncologist and nuclear medicine physician as a minimum, and should ideally also involve a palliative/pain specialist, a dietician and a psychologist.  Conclusion:   Treatment with 177Lu-PSMA has emerged as a promising systemic modality, which involves the delivery of targeted radiation therapy in the form of β-particles to sites of tumour tissue. Therapy is provided on an outpatient basis, is well tolerated with relatively few side effects and has a positive effect on overall survival and quality of life. At present, it is used mostly in the setting of advanced, castrate-resistant cancer. Patients are selected (amongst other criteria) based on the prior PSMA-based SPECT/PET/CT imaging (99mTc-,68Ga- or 18F-PSMA), which should demonstrate sufficient receptor expression in order to consider PSMA-based targeted radionuclide therapy.

However, the role of ING4 in prostate cancer (PC) is largely unknown. This study aimed to assess ING4's role in global transcriptional regulation in PC cells to identify potential cellular processes associated with ING4 loss. RNA-Seq using next-generation sequencing (NGS) was used to identify altered genes in LNCaP PC cells following ING4 depletion. Ingenuity pathways analysis (IPA®) was applied to the data to highlight candidates, ING4-regulated pathways, networks and cellular processes. Selected genes were validated using RT-qPCR. RNA-Seq of LNCaP cells revealed a total of 159 differentially expressed genes (fold change ≥ 1.5 or ≤ - 1.5, FDR ≤ 0.05) following ING4 knockdown. RT-qPCR used to validate the expression level of selected genes was in agreement with RNA-Seq results. Key genes, unique pathways, and biological networks were identified using IPA® analysis. This is the first report of global gene regulation in PC cells by ING4. The resultant differential expression profile revealed the potential role of ING4 in PC pathogenesis possibly through modulation of key genes, pathways and biological networks that are central drivers of the disease. Collectively, these findings shed light on a novel transcriptional regulator of PC that ultimately may influence the disease progression and as a potential target in the disease therapy.""","""['Aymen Shatnawi', 'Sridhar A Malkaram', 'Tamer Fandy', 'Efrosini Tsouko']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Mol Cell Biochem""","""['In vitro and in vivo inhibitory effect of Ad-ING4 gene on proliferation of human prostate cancer PC-3 cells.', 'Adenovirus-mediated ING4 expression suppresses pancreatic carcinoma cell growth via induction of cell-cycle alteration, apoptosis, and inhibition of tumor angiogenesis.', 'Miz1, a Novel Target of ING4, Can Drive Prostate Luminal Epithelial Cell Differentiation.', 'Roles of the tumor suppressor inhibitor of growth family member 4 (ING4) in cancer.', 'Inhibitor of growth-4 is a potential target for cancer therapy.', 'Identification of hub genes in bladder cancer based on weighted gene co-expression network analysis from TCGA database.', 'Upregulation of Phosphatase 1 Nuclear-Targeting Subunit (PNUTS) Is an Independent Predictor of Poor Prognosis in Prostate Cancer.']"""

In this study, RNA sequencing data from a unique patient-derived xenograft NEPC model and a clinical NEPC cohort were used to identify the potential genes driving NEPC progression. Enrichr analysis resulted in the identification of SRY-related HMG-box gene 2 (SOX2) as a potential repressor that causes decrease in the expression of AdPC specific genes in NEPC. Assays involving the stable overexpression of SOX2 in LNCaP and CWR22RV1 cells validated this role of SOX2 in vitro. Mechanistic studies showed that the repressor role of SOX2 was attributed to the marked global hypomethylation of histone H3, which was driven by the activation of lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1). Furthermore, Enrichr also predicted SOX2 as a driver gene involved in the upregulation of NEPC specific genes. However, SOX2 alone could only marginally induce the expression of some neuroendocrine markers in vitro, which was consistent with previous reports. Moreover, we also elucidated the molecular features of LNCaP-SOX2 cells that may confer resistance to androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT) and the inclination toward neuroendocrine transdifferentiation. The results of this study reveal a novel mechanism for SOX2 in the progression of NEPC via LSD1-mediated global epigenetic modulation.

Overexpression of thioredoxin-dependent peroxidase reductase (PRDX3) has been implicated in several cancers, including prostate, breast, colorectal and lung cancer. The aim of this study was to compare the immunohistochemical expression of PRDX3 in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) primary UM tissues of patients who did and did not develop metastatic disease.  Methods:   Immunohistochemical staining of PRDX3 was performed on FFPE tissue microarray samples of 92 primary UM tumours from patients who did and did not develop metastatic disease. The immunohistochemical staining was assessed by two observers who were blinded to all clinicopathological and cytogenetic details including metastatic/non-metastatic information. Based on a scoring system, expression of PRDX3 was graded as high or low.  Results:   There were 55 tumours (59.8%) from patients who developed metastatic disease, while 37 (40.2%) were from patients who did not develop metastasis. A statistically significant difference in PRDX3 expression was observed in patients who did and did not develop metastasis (p=0.001). A significant positive correlation between high PRDX3 expression and metastasis was observed (p=0.001). A significant negative correlation between PRDX3 expression and survival was found (p=0.005). Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed a statistically significant difference in overall survival between tumours that demonstrated low and high expression of PRDX3 (67.61 vs 130.64 months, respectively, p=0.013).

Materials and methods:   Seventy-four consecutive patients who underwent PAE from April 2014 through August 2018 were retrospectively reviewed. Patients had International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) >12, Quality of Life (QoL) score >2, prostate gland volume (PGV) >40 mL, age older than 45 years, and medical therapy failure. Twelve patients were excluded for bladder pathology or prostate cancer. Patients (n = 62, age = 71.8 ± 9.3 years, CCI = 3.5 ± 1.7, PGV = 174 ± 110 mL) had pre-procedure IPSS = 22.4 ± 5.6, QoL score = 4.4 ± 0.9, and post-void residual (PVR) = 172 ± 144 mL. Post-procedure values were compared to baseline at 1, 3, 6, 12, and 24 months. Associations between outcomes and PGV, MLE, age, and CCI were evaluated. Adverse event recording used Clavien-Dindo classification.  Results:   One month after PAE (n = 37), IPSS improved to 7.6 ± 5.2 (P < .0001) and QoL score improved to 1.7 ± 1.4 (P < .0001). At 3 months (n = 32), improvements continued, with IPSS = 6.4 ± 5.1 (P < .0001), QoL score = 1.2 ± 1.2 (P < .0001), PVR = 53 ± 41 mL (P < .001), and PGV = 73 ± 38 mL (P < .0001).

Objective:   To determine report outcomes according to treatment received in men in randomised and treatment choice cohorts.  Design, setting, and participants:   This study focuses on secondary care. Men with clinically localised prostate cancer at one of nine UK centres were invited to participate in the treatment trial comparing AM, radical prostatectomy, and radiotherapy.  Intervention:   Two cohorts included 1643 men who agreed to be randomised; 997 declined randomisation and chose treatment.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Health-related quality of life impacts on urinary, bowel, and sexual function were assessed using patient-reported outcome measures. Analysis was carried out based on treatment received for each cohort and on pooled estimates using meta-analysis. Differences were estimated with adjustment for known prognostic factors using propensity scores.  Results and limitations:   According to treatment received, more men receiving AM died of PCa (AM 1.85%, surgery 0.67%, radiotherapy 0.73%), whilst this difference remained consistent with chance in the randomised cohort (p=0.08); stronger evidence was found in the exploratory analyses (randomised plus choice cohort) when AM was compared with the combined radical treatment group (p=0.003). There was also strong evidence that metastasis (AM 5.6%, surgery 2.4%, radiotherapy 2.7%) and disease progression (AM 20.35%, surgery 5.87%, radiotherapy 6.62%) were more common in the AM group. Compared with AM, there were higher risks of sexual dysfunction (95% at 6mo) and urinary incontinence (55% at 6mo) after surgery, and of sexual dysfunction (88% at 6mo) and bowel dysfunction (5% at 6mo) after radiotherapy. The key limitations are the potential for bias when comparing groups defined by treatment received and outdating of the interventions being evaluated during the lengthy follow-up required in trials of screen-detected PCa.  Conclusions:   Analyses according to treatment received showed increased rates of disease-related events and lower rates of patient-reported harms in men managed by AM compared with men managed by radical treatment, and stronger evidence of greater PCa mortality in the AM group.  Patient summary:   More than 90 out of every 100 men with localised prostate cancer do not die of prostate cancer within 10yr, irrespective of whether treatment is by means of monitoring, surgery, or radiotherapy.

However, CA125 has been limited by low sensitivity and specificity in part due to normal variation between individuals. Personal characteristics that influence CA125 could be used to improve its performance as screening biomarker.  Methods:   We developed and validated linear and dichotomous (≥35 U/mL) circulating CA125 prediction models in postmenopausal women without ovarian cancer who participated in one of five large population-based studies: Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial (PLCO, n = 26,981), European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC, n = 861), the Nurses' Health Studies (NHS/NHSII, n = 81), and the New England Case Control Study (NEC, n = 923). The prediction models were developed using stepwise regression in PLCO and validated in EPIC, NHS/NHSII and NEC.  Result:   The linear CA125 prediction model, which included age, race, body mass index (BMI), smoking status and duration, parity, hysterectomy, age at menopause, and duration of hormone therapy (HT), explained 5% of the total variance of CA125. The correlation between measured and predicted CA125 was comparable in PLCO testing dataset (r = 0.18) and external validation datasets (r = 0.14). The dichotomous CA125 prediction model included age, race, BMI, smoking status and duration, hysterectomy, time since menopause, and duration of HT with AUC of 0.64 in PLCO and 0.80 in validation dataset.  Conclusions:   The linear prediction model explained a small portion of the total variability of CA125, suggesting the need to identify novel predictors of CA125. The dichotomous prediction model showed moderate discriminatory performance which validated well in independent dataset. Our dichotomous model could be valuable in identifying healthy women who may have elevated CA125 levels, which may contribute to reducing false positive tests using CA125 as screening biomarker.""","""['Naoko Sasamoto', 'Ana Babic', 'Bernard A Rosner', 'Renée T Fortner', 'Allison F Vitonis', 'Hidemi Yamamoto', 'Raina N Fichorova', 'Linda J Titus', 'Anne Tjønneland', 'Louise Hansen', 'Marina Kvaskoff', 'Agnès Fournier', 'Francesca Romana Mancini', 'Heiner Boeing', 'Antonia Trichopoulou', 'Eleni Peppa', 'Anna Karakatsani', 'Domenico Palli', 'Sara Grioni', 'Amalia Mattiello', 'Rosario Tumino', 'Valentina Fiano', 'N Charlotte Onland-Moret', 'Elisabete Weiderpass', 'Inger T Gram', 'J Ramón Quirós', 'Leila Lujan-Barroso', 'Maria-Jose Sánchez', 'Sandra Colorado-Yohar', 'Aurelio Barricarte', 'Pilar Amiano', 'Annika Idahl', 'Eva Lundin', 'Hanna Sartor', 'Kay-Tee Khaw', 'Timothy J Key', 'David Muller', 'Elio Riboli', 'Marc Gunter', 'Laure Dossus', 'Britton Trabert', 'Nicolas Wentzensen', 'Rudolf Kaaks', 'Daniel W Cramer', 'Shelley S Tworoger', 'Kathryn L Terry']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""J Ovarian Res""","""['Predicting Circulating CA125 Levels among Healthy Premenopausal Women.', 'Correlates of circulating ovarian cancer early detection markers and their contribution to discrimination of early detection models: results from the EPIC cohort.', 'Factors influencing serum CA125II levels in healthy postmenopausal women.', 'Highly accurate detection of ovarian cancer using CA125 but limited improvement with serum matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry profiling.', 'Screening postmenopausal women for ovarian cancer: a systematic review.', 'Relevant Risk Factor and Follow-Up of Lung Nodules in Physical Examination with Low-Dose CT Screening.', 'Molecular Management of High-Grade Serous Ovarian Carcinoma.', 'Factors associated with serum CA125 level in women without ovarian cancer in the United States: a population-based study.', 'Characteristics of genomic mutations and signaling pathway alterations in thymic epithelial tumors.', 'Extracellular Vesicle Molecular Signatures Characterize Metastatic Dynamicity in Ovarian Cancer.']"""

Stress granules (SG) assembly is an evolutionarily conserved strategy for survival of cells under stress, and often upregulated in human cancers. We investigated the role of SPOP mutations in aberrant activation of the SG in prostate cancer and explored the relevanve of the mechanism in therapy resistance.  Methods:   We identified SG nucleating protein Caprin1 as a SPOP interactor by using the yeast two hybrid methods. A series of functional analyses in cell lines, patient samples, and xenograft models were performed to investigate the biological significance and clinical relevance of SPOP regulation of SG signaling in prostate cancer.  Results:   The cytoplasmic form of wild-type (WT) SPOP recognizes and triggers ubiquitin-dependent degradation of Caprin1. Caprin1 abundance is elevated in SPOP-mutant expressing prostate cancer cell lines and patient specimens. SPOP WT suppresses SG assembly, while the prostate cancer-associated mutants enhance SG assembly in a Caprin1-dependent manner. Knockout of SPOP or expression of prostate cancer-associated SPOP mutants conferred resistance to death caused by SG inducers (e.g. docetaxel, sodium arsenite and H2O2) in prostate cancer cells.  Conclusions:   SG assembly is aberrantly elevated in SPOP-mutated prostate cancer. SPOP mutations cause resistance to cellular stress induced by chemtherapeutic drug such as docetaxel in prostate cancer.""","""['Qing Shi', 'Yasheng Zhu', 'Jian Ma', 'Kun Chang', 'Dongling Ding', 'Yang Bai', 'Kun Gao', 'Pingzhao Zhang', 'Ren Mo', 'Kai Feng', 'Xiaying Zhao', 'Liang Zhang', 'Huiru Sun', 'Dongyue Jiao', 'Yingji Chen', 'Yinghao Sun', 'Shi-Min Zhao', 'Haojie Huang', 'Yao Li', 'Shancheng Ren', 'Chenji Wang']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Mol Cancer""","""['Destruction of DDIT3/CHOP protein by wild-type SPOP but not prostate cancer-associated mutants.', 'Intrinsic BET inhibitor resistance in SPOP-mutated prostate cancer is mediated by BET protein stabilization and AKT-mTORC1 activation.', 'Mutated SPOP E3 Ligase Promotes 17βHSD4 Protein Degradation to Drive Androgenesis and Prostate Cancer Progression.', 'The ubiquitin ligase adaptor SPOP in cancer.', 'The emerging role of SPOP protein in tumorigenesis and cancer therapy.', 'CDC20 Is Regulated by the Histone Methyltransferase, KMT5A, in Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Cul3 substrate adaptor SPOP targets Nup153 for degradation.', 'Stress granules affect the sensitivity of renal cancer cells to sorafenib by sequestering and stabilizing COX‑2 mRNA.', 'Identification and validation of a novel stress granules-related prognostic model in colorectal cancer.', 'Stress granules: functions and mechanisms in cancer.']"""

Few studies have compared the performance of both calculators across racial groups.  Methods:   From 1485 prospectively recruited participants, 954 men were identified undergoing initial prostate biopsy for abnormal PSA or digital rectal examination in five Chicago hospitals between 2009 and 2014. Discrimination, calibration, and frequency of avoided biopsies were calculated to assess the performance of both risk calculators.  Results:   Of 954 participants, 463 (48.5%) were Black, 355 (37.2%) were White, and 136 (14.2%) identified as Other. Biopsy results were as follows: 310 (32.5%) exhibited no cancer, 323 (33.9%) indolent prostate cancer, and 321 (33.6%) clinically significant prostate cancer (csPCa). Differences in area under the curve (AUC)s for the detection of csPCa between PCPT and PBCG were not statistically different across all racial groups. PBCG did not improve calibration plots in Blacks and Others, as it showed higher levels of overprediction at most risk thresholds. PCPT led to an increased number of avoidable biopsies in minorities compared to PBCG at the 30% threshold (68% vs. 28% of all patients) with roughly similar rates of missed csPCa (23% vs. 20%).  Conclusion:   Significant improvements were noticed in PBCG's calibrations and net benefits in Whites compared to PCPT. Since PBCG's improvements in Blacks are disputable and potentially biases a greater number of low risk Black and Other men towards unnecessary biopsies, PCPT may lead to better biopsy decisions in racial minority groups. Further comparisons of commonly used risk calculators across racial groups is warranted to minimize excessive biopsies and overdiagnosis in ethnic minorities.""","""['Samuel Carbunaru', 'Oluwarotimi S Nettey', 'Pooja Gogana', 'Irene B Helenowski', 'Borko Jovanovic', 'Maria Ruden', 'Courtney M P Hollowell', 'Roohollah Sharifi', 'Rick A Kittles', 'Edward Schaeffer', 'Peter Gann', 'Adam B Murphy']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""BMC Urol""","""['A prostate biopsy risk calculator based on MRI: development and comparison of the Prospective Loyola University multiparametric MRI (PLUM) and Prostate Biopsy Collaborative Group (PBCG) risk calculators.', 'A risk calculator to inform the need for a prostate biopsy: a rapid access clinic cohort.', 'External Validation of the Prostate Biopsy Collaborative Group Risk Calculator and the Rotterdam Prostate Cancer Risk Calculator in a Swedish Population-based Screening Cohort.', 'Prostate-Specific Antigen-Based Screening for Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Evidence Review for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force Internet.', 'Do prostate cancer risk models improve the predictive accuracy of PSA screening?

Methods:   The proliferation, migration and invasion of prostate cancer cells were assessed by CCK-8 and transwell assay. HIF-1α expression of osteoblasts and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers of prostate cancer cells were examined by Western blot. The mRNA level of cytokines associated with bone metastasis in osteoblasts and EMT markers in PC-3 and DU145 cells were performed by qRT-PCR. Functional rescue experiment of cells were performed by using siRNA, plasmid transfection and inhibitor treatment.  Results:   Isoproterenol (ISO), a pharmacological surrogate of sympathetic nerve activation induced by chronic stress, exhibited no direct effect on migration and invasion of PC-3 and DU145 prostate cancer cells. Whereas, osteoblasts pretreated with ISO promoted EMT, migration and invasion of PC-3 and DU145 cells, which could be inhibited by β2AR inhibitor. Mechanistically, ISO increased the secretion of CXCL12 via the β2AR-HIF-1α signaling in osteoblasts. Moreover, overexpression of HIF-1α osteoblasts promoted migration and invasion of PC-3 and DU145 cells, which was inhibited by addition of recombinant knockdown of CXCR4 in PC-3 and DU145 cells, and inhibiting CXCL12-CXCR4 signaling with LY2510924 blunted the effects of osteoblasts in response to ISO on EMT and migration as well as invasion of PC-3 and DU145 cells.  Conclusions:   These findings demonstrated that β2AR-HIF-1α-CXCL12 signaling in osteoblasts facilitates migration and invasion as well as EMT of prostate cancer cells, and may play a potential role in affecting bone metastasis of prostate cancer.""","""['Zhibin Huang', 'Guihuan Li', 'Zhishuai Zhang', 'Ruonan Gu', 'Wenyang Wang', 'Xiaoju Lai', 'Zhong-Kai Cui', 'Fangyin Zeng', 'Shiyuan Xu', 'Fan Deng']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""BMC Cancer""","""['AMD3100 inhibits epithelial-mesenchymal transition, cell invasion, and metastasis in the liver and the lung through blocking the SDF-1α/CXCR4 signaling pathway in prostate cancer.', 'Role of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway in epithelial-mesenchymal transition of human prostate cancer induced by hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha.', 'A ROS/STAT3/HIF-1α signaling cascade mediates EGF-induced TWIST1 expression and prostate cancer cell invasion.', 'The role of hypoxia on prostate cancer progression and metastasis.', 'Hypoxia, partial EMT and collective migration: Emerging culprits in metastasis.', 'CXCL12-CXCR4/CXCR7 Axis in Cancer: from Mechanisms to Clinical Applications.', 'Crosstalk Between Peripheral Innervation and Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma.', 'Amino Acid Metabolism in Bone Metastatic Disease.', 'The Secretome of Parental and Bone Metastatic Breast Cancer Elicits Distinct Effects in Human Osteoclast Activity after Activation of β2 Adrenergic Signaling.', 'PlexinA1 activation induced by β2-AR promotes epithelial-mesenchymal transition through JAK-STAT3 signaling in human gastric cancer cells.']"""
