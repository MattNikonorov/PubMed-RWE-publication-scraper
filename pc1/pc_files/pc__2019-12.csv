Objective:   To evaluate whether single-fraction radiotherapy is noninferior to 5 fractions of radiotherapy.  Design, setting, and participants:   Multicenter noninferiority randomized clinical trial conducted in 42 UK and 5 Australian radiotherapy centers. Eligible patients (n = 686) had metastatic cancer with spinal cord or cauda equina compression, life expectancy greater than 8 weeks, and no previous radiotherapy to the same area. Patients were recruited between February 2008 and April 2016, with final follow-up in September 2017.  Interventions:   Patients were randomized to receive external beam single-fraction 8-Gy radiotherapy (n = 345) or 20 Gy of radiotherapy in 5 fractions over 5 consecutive days (n = 341).  Main outcomes and measures:   The primary end point was ambulatory status at week 8, based on a 4-point scale and classified as grade 1 (ambulatory without the use of aids and grade 5 of 5 muscle power) or grade 2 (ambulatory using aids or grade 4 of 5 muscle power). The noninferiority margin for the difference in ambulatory status was -11%. Secondary end points included ambulatory status at weeks 1, 4, and 12 and overall survival.  Results:   Among 686 randomized patients (median [interquartile range] age, 70 [64-77] years; 503 (73%) men; 44% had prostate cancer, 19% had lung cancer, and 12% had breast cancer), 342 (49.8%) were analyzed for the primary end point (255 patients died before the 8-week assessment). Ambulatory status grade 1 or 2 at week 8 was achieved by 115 of 166 (69.3%) patients in the single-fraction group vs 128 of 176 (72.7%) in the multifraction group (difference, -3.5% [1-sided 95% CI, -11.5% to ∞]; P value for noninferiority = .06). The difference in ambulatory status grade 1 or 2 in the single-fraction vs multifraction group was -0.4% (63.9% vs 64.3%; [1-sided 95% CI, -6.9 to ∞]; P value for noninferiority = .004) at week 1, -0.7% (66.8% vs 67.6%; [1-sided 95% CI, -8.1 to ∞]; P value for noninferiority = .01) at week 4, and 4.1% (71.8% vs 67.7%; [1-sided 95% CI, -4.6 to ∞]; P value for noninferiority = .002) at week 12. Overall survival rates at 12 weeks were 50% in the single-fraction group vs 55% in the multifraction group (stratified hazard ratio, 1.02 [95% CI, 0.74-1.41]). Of the 11 other secondary end points that were analyzed, the between-group differences were not statistically significant or did not meet noninferiority criterion.  Conclusions and relevance:   Among patients with malignant metastatic solid tumors and spinal canal compression, a single radiotherapy dose, compared with a multifraction dose delivered over 5 days, did not meet the criterion for noninferiority for the primary outcome (ambulatory at 8 weeks). However, the extent to which the lower bound of the CI overlapped with the noninferiority margin should be considered when interpreting the clinical importance of this finding.

Purpose:   To optimize the RED MRI protocol for the prostate, and to investigate its potential for prostate cancer (PCa) diagnosis.  Study type:   Prospective.  Population:   Ten asymptomatic healthy volunteers and 35 patients with clinical suspicion of PCa.  Sequence:   3T T2 - and diffusion-weighted MRI with b values: b = 0, 50, [100], 150, [200], 250, [300], 400, 800 s/mm2 (values in brackets were only used for patients).  Assessment:   Monte Carlo simulations were performed to assess noise sensitivity of RED as a function of intermediate b value. Volunteers were scanned 3 times to assess repeatability of RED. Patient data were used to investigate RED's potential for discriminating between biopsy-confirmed cancer and healthy tissue, and between true and false positive radiological findings.  Statistical tests:   Within-subject coefficient of variation (WCV) to assess repeatability and receiver-operating characteristic curve analysis and logistic regression to assess diagnostic performance of RED.  Results:   The repeatability was acceptable (WCV = 0.2-0.3) for all intermediate b values tested, apart from b = 50 s/mm2 (WCV = 0.3-0.4). The simulated RED values agreed well with the experimental data, showing that an intermediate b value between 150-250 s/mm2 minimizes noise sensitivity in both peripheral zone (PZ) and transition zone (TZ). RED calculated with the b values 0, 150 and 800 s/mm2 was significantly higher in tumors than in healthy tissue in both PZ (P < 0.001, area under the curve [AUC] = 0.85) and PZ + TZ (P < 0.001, AUC = 0.84). RED was shown to aid apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) in differentiating between false-positive findings and true-positive PCa in the PZ (AUC; RED = 0.71, ADC = 0.74, RED+ADC = 0.77).  Data conclusion:   RED is a repeatable biomarker that may have value for prostate cancer diagnosis. An intermediate b value in the range of 150-250 s/mm2 minimizes the influence of noise and maximizes repeatability.  Level of evidence:   2 Technical Efficacy Stage: 1 J. Magn. Reson.

Material and methods:   Training of the DL-algorithm regarding prostate volume was performed on manually segmented CT images in 100 patients. Validation of the DL-algorithm was carried out in 45 patients with biopsy-proven hormone-naïve prostate cancer. The automated measurements of prostate volume were compared with manual measurements made independently by two observers. PET/CT measurements of tumour burden based on volume and SUV of abnormal voxels were calculated automatically. Voxels in the co-registered 18 F-choline PET images above a standardized uptake value (SUV) of 2·65, and corresponding to the prostate as defined by the automated segmentation in the CT images, were defined as abnormal. Validation of abnormal voxels was performed by manual segmentation of radiotracer uptake. Agreement between algorithm and observers regarding prostate volume was analysed by Sørensen-Dice index (SDI). Associations between automatically based PET/CT biomarkers and age, prostate-specific antigen (PSA), Gleason score as well as overall survival were evaluated by a univariate Cox regression model.  Results:   The SDI between the automated and the manual volume segmentations was 0·78 and 0·79, respectively. Automated PET/CT measures reflecting total lesion uptake and the relation between volume of abnormal voxels and total prostate volume were significantly associated with overall survival (P = 0·02), whereas age, PSA, and Gleason score were not.

The two sites in ELK1 required for AR binding are conserved in other members of the TCF subfamily, ELK3 and ELK4. Here we examine the potential utility of the three proteins as prognosticators of disease recurrence in PCa.  Methods:   Transcriptional activity assays; Retrospective analysis of PCa recurrence using data on 501 patients in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database; Unpaired Wilcoxon rank-sum test and multiple comparison correction using the Holm's method; Spearman's correlations; Kaplan-Meier methods; Univariable and multivariable Cox regression analyses; LASSO-based penalized Cox regression models; Time-dependent area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve.  Results:   ELK4 but not ELK3 was coactivated by AR similar to ELK1. Tumor expression of neither ELK3 nor ELK4 was associated with disease-free survival (DFS). ELK1 was associated with higher clinical T-stage, pathology T-stage, Gleason score, prognostic grade, and positive lymph node status. ELK1 was a negative prognosticator of DFS, independent of ELK3, ELK4, clinical T-stage, pathology T-stage, prognostic grade, lymph node status, age, and race. Inclusion of ELK1 increased the abilities of the Oncotype DX and Prolaris gene panels to predict disease recurrence, correctly predicting disease recurrence in a unique subset of patients.

In this retrospective study, our aim is to investigate upgrading after RP in grade groups (GG) and clinical predictive, and postoperative histopathological factors associated with GG upgrading (GGU).  Patients and methods:   A total of 753 patients undergoing RP between January 2006 and June 2019 at our institution were investigated. Overall cohort were divided into two groups according to GGU status after RP as nonupgrading and upgrading. Retrospectively documented preoperative clinical and postoperative histopathological parameters were compared between two groups. Furthermore, we investigated a subgroup of institutional cohort (n = 398) whose prostate biopsy (Pbx) and RP were performed in our institution and we also divided this cohort into two groups according to GGU status. χ2 and Mann-Whitney U tests were used for comparative analyses. The independent preoperative predictive and postoperative histopathological factors associated with GGU were investigated using multivariate logistic regression analysis.  Results:   The total GGU was 55.8% in overall cohort and 45.2% in institutional cohort. The GGU was found as the most common in bioptic GG1 group in both overall (64.0%), and institutional (54.5%) cohorts. In multivariate analyses, the noninstitutional Pbx (odds ratio [OR] = 2.56; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.86-3.51; P < .001), tumor positive core numbers in Pbx (OR = 1.11; 95%CI: 1.04-1.19; P = .003), increased prostate specific antigen (PSA) density (OR = 3.59; 95%CI: 1.03-12.52, P = .045) and age (OR = 1.03; 95%CI: 1.00-1.05, P = .046) were independent clinical predictors of GGU in overall cohort whereas only increased PSA density (OR = 5.94; 95%CI: 1.28-27.50; P = .023) was independent predictor in institutional cohort. Among postoperative histopathological factors, perineural invasion (OR = 1.57; 95%CI: 1.70-3.87; P < .001 and OR = 2.53; 95%CI: 1.46-4.40; P = .001, respectively), increased maximum tumor diameter (OR = 1.46; 95%CI: 1.23-1.73; P < .001 and OR = 1.33; 95%CI: 1.07-1.66; P = .010, respectively), and high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (HGPIN) existence at tumor surrounding tissue (OR = 1.96; 95%CI: 1.32-2.90; P = .001 and OR = 1.87; 95%CI: 1.10-3.21; P = .022, respectively) were independently associated with GGU after RP, in both of overall and institutional cohorts.  Conclusions:   Noninstitutional prostate biopsy, increased PSA density, higher tumor positive cores in Pbx and older age are the clinical predictors of upgrading after RP in contemporary GG.

Methods:   SEER*Stat version 8.3.4 was used to calculate annual prostate cancer incidence rates from 2010 to 2015 for men aged ≥50 years according to American Joint Committee on Cancer stage at diagnosis (localized vs metastatic), NCCN risk group (low vs unfavorable [intermediate or high-risk]), and age group (50-74 years vs ≥75 years).

However, it is not clear the extent to which these low rates are driven by urologists' referral and radiation oncologists' treatment patterns.  Method:   The Clinician-Led Improvement in Cancer Care (CLICC) implementation trial was conducted in nine public hospitals in New South Wales, Australia. Men who underwent RP for prostate cancer during 2013-2015 and had at least one high-risk pathological feature of extracapsular extension, seminal vesicle invasion and/or positive surgical margins were included in these analyses. Outcomes were as follows: (i) referral to a radiation oncologist within 4 months after RP ('referred'); (ii) commencement of radiotherapy within 6 months after RP among those who consulted a radiation oncologist ('radiotherapy after consultation').  Results:   Three hundred and twenty-five (30%) of 1071 patients were 'referred', and 74 (61%) of 121 patients received 'radiotherapy after consultation'. Overall, the probability of receiving radiotherapy within 6 months after RP was 15%. The probability of being 'referred' increased according to higher 5-year risk of cancer-recurrence (P < 0.001).  Conclusion:   Only 30% of patients with high-risk features are referred to a radiation oncologist with the likelihood of referral being influenced by the perceived risk of cancer-recurrence as well as the urologist's institutional/personal preference. When patients are seen by a radiation oncologist, 61% receive radiotherapy within 6 months after RP with the likelihood of receiving radiotherapy not being heavily influenced by increasing risk of recurrence. This suggests many suitable patients would receive radiotherapy if referred and seen by a radiation oncologist.""","""['Sam Egger', 'David P Smith', 'Bernadette Bea Brown', 'Andrew B Kneebone', 'Amanda Dominello', 'Andrew J Brooks', 'Jane Young', 'Miranda Xhilaga', 'Mary Haines', ""Dianne L O'Connell""]""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""J Med Imaging Radiat Oncol""","""['In reply to Egger et al.: Lack of benefit from adjuvant postoperative radiotherapy and issues raised about upfront management of high- and very-high-risk prostate cancer patients.', 'Population-based referrals for adjuvant radiotherapy after radical prostatectomy in men with prostate cancer: impact of randomized trials.', 'Discord Among Radiation Oncologists and Urologists in the Postoperative Management of High-Risk Prostate Cancer.', ""United States radiation oncologists' and urologists' opinions about screening and treatment of prostate cancer vary by region."", 'The role of androgen ablation in patients with biochemical or local failure after definitive radiation therapy: a survey of practice patterns of urologists and radiation oncologists in the United States.', 'Adjuvant radiotherapy following radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer.', 'Clinical practice guideline adherence in oncology: A qualitative study of insights from clinicians in Australia.']"""

[18F]FASu synthesis by the commonly used Kryptofix 2.2.2/K2CO3-facilitated fluorination method results in four diastereomers, as a result of 2 chiral centers at positions 2- and 5- of the tracer. We recently reported the synthesis of the optically pure 2S-[18F]FASu from chiral precursors. Our preliminary results indicated preferential uptake of the 2S-isomer by tumor cells compared to 2R-[18F]FASu. Few studies have investigated the biodistribution of chiral 18F-labeled amino acids. The aim of this study was to evaluate the imaging utility and biodistribution of the 5-position diastereomers as well as the racemic (2S,5R/S-) mixture in three different tumor models.  Procedures:   In vitro tracer uptake experiments and Western blotting were performed in breast cancer (MDA-MB-231), glioblastoma (U-87), and prostate (PC-3) cancer cell lines. PET imaging and biodistribution studies were conducted in xenograft-bearing immunocompromised Rag2M female mice.  Results:   All three tracer conformations allowed for the visualization of tumor xenografts at 1 h (for U-87 and PC-3 tumors) or 2 h (in the case of MDA-MB-231 xenografts) post-injection, with the racemate (2S,5R/S-) displaying similar image contrast as compared to the 5- position diastereomers and the 2S,5S-[18F]FASu conformation exhibiting relatively higher contrast for imaging U-87 and PC-3 xenografts. Tumor uptake of the isomers was blocked by an excess of the non-radioactive standard, aminosuberic acid (ASu), confirming target specificity. All three isomers were excreted via the renal pathway. Biodistribution analyses showed that PC-3 tumors had the highest tracer uptake, and the accumulation (%ID/g) of the 2S,5R/S-, 2S,5S-, and 2S,5R- isomers was 9.19 ± 1.14, 8.00 ± 1.41, and 7.16 ± 2.13 at 1 h post-injection, respectively. This gave corresponding tumor-to-muscle ratios of 33.68 ± 9.52, 31.42 ± 4.54, and 25.33 ± 4.97, respectively.  Conclusion:   Our data suggest that pure 2S-[18F]FASu can be used to noninvasively image system xC- in a variety of cancers, either as the racemic mixture (2S,5R/S-) or optically pure form. Furthermore, this work shows potential utility of [18F]FASu for detection of glioblastoma and prostate cancer.""","""['Milena Čolović', 'Hua Yang', 'Helen Merkens', 'Nadine Colpo', 'François Bénard', 'Paul Schaffer']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Mol Imaging Biol""","""['Functional imaging of oxidative stress with a novel PET imaging agent, 18F-5-fluoro-L-aminosuberic acid.', '18F-5-Fluoroaminosuberic Acid as a Potential Tracer to Gauge Oxidative Stress in Breast Cancer Models.', 'Non-invasive Use of Positron Emission Tomography to Monitor Diethyl maleate and Radiation-Induced Changes in System xC- Activity in Breast Cancer.', 'Comparative Evaluation of 18F5-Fluoroaminosuberic Acid and (4S)-4-3-18Ffluoropropyl)-l-Glutamate as System xC--Targeting Radiopharmaceuticals.', '18F-(2S,4R)4-fluoroglutamine.', 'Radiotracer stereochemistry affects substrate affinity and kinetics for improved imaging of system xC- in tumors.']"""

Methods:   We identified 136 patients with prostate cancer who underwent 3-T mpMRI before prostatectomy at a single academic center. Two uroradiologists scored all MRIs with Prostate Imaging-Reporting and Data System version 2 (PI-RADS v2). A genitourinary pathologist mapped tumor foci from serial whole-mount radical prostatectomy sections. We assessed concordance of images with cancer sites. Tumor foci with Gleason score ≥ 3 + 4 or volume ≥ 0.5 mL were considered significant.  Results:   A total of 122 foci in 106 cases were identified with mpMRI. Twenty-four were PI-RADS 3, 52 were 4, and 46 were 5. A total of 274 tumor foci were identified with whole-mount pathology. The sensitivity stratified by location to detect significant cancer with a PI-RADS cutoff value of 3 was 56.0% overall, 50.0% in the peripheral zone (PZ), 71.2% in the transitional zone (TZ), 62.4% anterior, 49.5% posterior, 42.0% apical, 63.6% in the midgland, and 43.8% in the gland base. In multivariate analysis, tumor location was not a significant predictor of identification by mpMRI. Tumor volume, Gleason score, and index tumor status were significantly associated with identification by mpMRI.  Conclusions:   mpMRI detected the majority of high-grade and large cancers, but had low sensitivity in the PZ, posterior, and apex and base of the gland.

Methods:   In this retrospective study, 88 consecutive patients who underwent [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT on a digital PET/CT (dPET/CT) scanner for recurrent prostate cancer (PC) were included in a first cohort. In a second step, 88 individuals who underwent an analogue [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT (aPET/CT) were selected after they were matched to the first cohort for clinical parameters. Following consensus read by two nuclear medicine physicians, the number and type of PC lesions as well as benign, PSMA-positive lesions were recorded. The results were complemented by extensive [68Ga]Ga phantom measurements to determine imaging characteristics of both scanners.  Results:   dPET/CT revealed a greater number of PC lesions compared to aPET/CT (326 versus 142) as well as a proportional increase in benign causes of tracer-uptake (144 versus 65). A greater number of scans were noted as pathological for PC on dPET/CT (74/88) compared to aPET/CT (64/88, p < 0.05). The PSMA positivity rate for PC was significantly higher in dPET/CT for the lowest PSA values (PSA < 2.0 ng/ml, p < 0.05).  Conclusion:   dPET/CT detected more PC lesions compared to aPET/CT.

LRIG1 also inhibits castration-resistant PCa and exhibits therapeutic efficacy in pre-established tumors.

Part 3: Targeted Biopsy""","""Background:   After a lesion has been assessed adequately on multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI), magnetic resonance (MR)-guided biopsy (MRGB) is the logical next step. The choice of the MRGB technique, however, is difficult.  Objective:   To show the advantages and disadvantages of the three commonly used MRGB techniques-MRI-ultrasound fusion MRGB (fus-MRGB), direct in-bore MRGB (inbore-MRGB), and cognitive MRGB (cog-MRGB), and to determine when each of the techniques can be used.  Design, setting, and participants:   Based on expert opinion and literature overview, the advantages, disadvantages, and challenges of fus-MRGB, inbore-MRGB, and cog-MRGB are evaluated. Further, the clinical setting of each biopsy strategy is assessed.  Surgical procedure:   Based on expert opinion and literature data, the three biopsy procedures are evaluated, and the important pros and cons are determined.  Measurements:   The basic concept of each biopsy technique is reviewed, which would result in a clinical recommendation. This will be shown in individual patients.  Results and limitations:   The accompanying video shows how fus-MRGB and inbore-MRGB are performed in our hospital. An important advantage of fus-MRGB is its generally availability; however, it has fusion-error limitations. Although not supported by evidence, inbore-MRGB seems to be better suited for smaller lesions, but is rather expensive. Cog-MRGB is easy to use and inexpensive, but is more operator dependent as it requires knowledge about both ultrasound and MR images. Readers should be aware that our MRGB approach is largely based on expert opinion and, where possible, supported by evidence.  Conclusions:   This article and the accompanying video show different MRGB techniques. The advantages and disadvantages of the three biopsy techniques, as well as the clinical setting in which each biopsy strategy is being used in our hospital, are discussed. Fus-MRGB is our first choice for prostate biopsy. Direct inbore-MRGB is used in difficult lesions but is mainly used as a ""problem solver"" (eg, a negative biopsy with a high suspicion for clinically significant prostate cancer). In our opinion, cog-MRGB is best for sampling larger and diffuse lesions.  Patient summary:   This third surgery in motion contribution shows our approach in magnetic resonance (MR)-guided biopsy (MRGB). Fusion MRGB is our first choice for prostate biopsy. In-bore MRGB is used in selected, difficult cases, mainly as a problem solver.

Despite recent advances, optimal population-based cancer screening methods remain an unmet need. Due to its early onset, cancer specificity and accessibility in body fluids, aberrant DNA promoter methylation might be a valuable minimally invasive tool for early cancer detection. Herein, we aimed to develop a minimally invasive methylation-based test for simultaneous early detection of LC, PCa and CRC in males, using liquid biopsies.  Results:   Circulating cell-free DNA was extracted from 102 LC, 121 PCa and 100 CRC patients and 136 asymptomatic donors' plasma samples. Sodium-bisulfite modification and whole-genome amplification was performed. Promoter methylation levels of APCme, FOXA1me, GSTP1me, HOXD3me, RARβ2me, RASSF1Ame, SEPT9me and SOX17me were assessed by multiplex quantitative methylation-specific PCR. SEPT9me and SOX17me were the only biomarkers shared by all three cancer types, although they detected CRC with limited sensitivity. A ""PanCancer"" panel (FOXA1me, RARβ2me and RASSF1Ame) detected LC and PCa with 64% sensitivity and 70% specificity, complemented with ""CancerType"" panel (GSTP1me and SOX17me) which discriminated between LC and PCa with 93% specificity, but with modest sensitivity. Moreover, a HOXD3me and RASSF1Ame panel discriminated small cell lung carcinoma from non-small cell lung carcinoma with 75% sensitivity, 88% specificity, 6.5 LR+ and 0.28 LR-. An APCme and RASSF1Ame panel independently predicted disease-specific mortality in LC patients.  Conclusions:   We concluded that a DNA methylation-based test in liquid biopsies might enable minimally invasive screening of LC and PCa, improving patient compliance and reducing healthcare costs.

Methods:   We obtained gene expression data of prostate cancer from TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas) database for analysis. We analyzed the DEGs (differentially expressed genes), and used online tools or software to analyze Gene ontology (GO) and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA), Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes/Proteins, and Molecular Complex Detection.  Results:   Latest TCGA data showed PTEN mutation in about 22% patients. 1736 DEGs in total were identified. Results of gene functional enrichment analyses showed that muscle contraction, negative regulation of growth and multiple metabolic progression were significantly enriched. GNG13, ACTN2, POTEE, ACTA1, MYH6, MYH3, MYH7, MYL1, TNNC1 and TNNC2 were the top ten hub genes. Patients with PTEN mutation showed relatively decreased mRNA expression level of PTEN.

There are still a few series, with a medium follow-up longer than 5 years, reporting data on pathological upgrading. The objective is to evaluate the changes in surveillance biopsies of patients with low-risk PC in a long-term follow-up and determine if a longer stay in AS could involve worse pathological findings.  Materials and methods:   A retrospective analysis of our institutional database of patients with PC undergoing AS during 2004 to 2018 was performed. The inclusion criteria were prostate-specific antigen (PSA) ≤ 10 ng/mL, Gleason grade 1 and T1c/T2a. Patients were assessed by serum PSA level and digital rectal examination at 6-month intervals. Transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsies were performed during the first year of follow-up, and every 2 or 3 years thereafter. The pathology details of biopsies were analyzed and compared with the current series on AS.  Results:   Three-hundred nineteen patients undergoing AS were evaluated with a median follow-up of 5.3 years and a mean age of 67.4 years. Sixty-three patients did not meet all the criteria to be considered low-risk PC but were included in the analysis. Overall, 128 patients (40.1%) underwent active treatment (84.7% of them due to pathological progression in surveillance biopsies). The proportion of patients with a reported upgrading ranged between 19.4% and 35.3%, although only the fourth biopsy showed an upgrading proportion of over 30%. Limitations include the retrospective design of the study and the existence of different protocols between other cohorts that make it difficult to compare their results.  Conclusions:   For patients who remained in surveillance the percentage of upgrading increased slightly with the time, being more frequent after the third-surveillance biopsy. These findings support the importance of extending surveillance biopsies for patients who remain candidates for curative treatment.""","""['Guillermo Fernández-Conejo', 'Virginia Hernández', 'Ana Guijarro', 'Enrique de la Peña', 'Alberto Inés', 'Elia Pérez-Fernández', 'Carlos Llorente']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['A Decade of Active Surveillance in the PRIAS Study: An Update and Evaluation of the Criteria Used to Recommend a Switch to Active Treatment.', 'Compliance Rates with the Prostate Cancer Research International Active Surveillance (PRIAS) Protocol and Disease Reclassification in Noncompliers.', 'Risk-stratification based on magnetic resonance imaging and prostate-specific antigen density may reduce unnecessary follow-up biopsy procedures in men on active surveillance for low-risk prostate cancer.', 'Active Surveillance for Prostate Cancer: Past, Current, and Future Trends.', 'Active Surveillance in Intermediate-Risk Prostate Cancer: A Review of the Current Data.']"""

The regulation of pH in tumours involves the interaction of several proteins, including the carbonic anhydrases which catalyze the formation of bicarbonate and protons from carbon dioxide and water. Among CA isoforms, CA IX is over-expressed in a large number of solid tumours, conferring to cancer cells a survival advantage in hypoxic and acidic microenvironment, but there isn't evidence that CA IX expression could have a real clinical impact. Therefore, in this study for the first time the expression and activity of CA IX have been investigated in the plasmatic exosomes obtained from patients with prostate carcinoma (PCa). For this purpose, the study was performed through different methodological approaches, such as NTA, western blot analysis, enzyme activity assay, Nanoscale flow cytometry, ELISA, confocal microscopy. The results showed that PCa exosomes significantly overexpressed CA IX levels and related activity as compared to healthy donors. Furthermore, CA IX expression and activity were correlated to the exosome intraluminal pH, demonstrating for the first time that PCa exosomes are acidic.

We examined video-recorded clinical interactions to identify circumstances under which patients potentially eligible for a trial at a major cancer center were offered a trial.  Methods:   We conducted a qualitative directed content analysis of 62 recorded interactions with physicians (n = 13) and patients with intermediate- or high-risk prostate cancer (n = 43). Patients were screened and potentially eligible for a trial. We observed and coded the interactions in 3 steps: (1) classification of all interactions as explicit offer, offer pending, trial discussed/not offered, or trial not discussed; (2) in interactions with no explicit offer, classification of whether the cancer had progressed; (3) in interactions classified as progression but no trial offered, identification of factors discussed that may explain the lack of an offer.  Results:   Of the 62 interactions, 29% were classified as explicit offer, 12% as offer pending, 18% as trial discussed/not offered, and 39% as trial not discussed. Of those with no offer, 57% included information that the cancer had not progressed. In 68% of the remaining interactions with patients whose cancer had progressed but did not receive an offer, reasons for the lack of offer were identified, but in 32%, no explanation was provided.  Conclusion:   Even in optimal circumstances, few patients were offered a trial, often because their cancer had not progressed.

Expressions of relative molecules were detected by Quantitative real time PCR (qRT-PCR) and western blot. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) assays were used to evaluate the interaction between intra-nuclear MEG3, histone methyltransferase EZH2 and Engrailed-2 (EN2). The impacts of MEG3 on the viability, proliferation and invasion of prostate cancer cells (PC3) were evaluated by methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium, colony formation and transwell assays, respectively. PC3 cells were transfected with MEG3 and transplanted into nude mice to analyse the effect of MEG3 on tumourigenesis of PC3 cells in vivo. EN2 expression was inversely proportional to MEG3 in the prostate cancer tissues and PC3 cells. RIP results showed that intra-nuclear MEG3 could bind to EZH2. Knockdown of MEG3 and/or EZH2 up-regulated EN2 expression and reduced the recruitment of EZH2 and H3K27me3 to EN2, while over-expressed MEG3 caused opposite effects. MEG3 over-expression suppressed cell viability, colony formation, cell invasion and migration of PC3 cells in vitro and inhibited tumourigenesis of PC3 cells in vivo, while EN2 over-expression diminished the effects. These findings indicated that MEG3 facilitated H3K27 trimethylation of EN2 via binding to EZH2, thus suppressed the development of prostate cancer.""","""['Yaojun Zhou', 'Hongqiong Yang', 'Wei Xia', 'Li Cui', 'Renfang Xu', 'Hao Lu', 'Dong Xue', 'Zinong Tian', 'Tao Ding', 'Yunjie Cao', 'Qianqian Shi', 'Xiaozhou He']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""J Biochem""","""['Long Noncoding RNA Meg3 Regulates Mafa Expression in Mouse Beta Cells by Inactivating Rad21, Smc3 or Sin3α.', 'Involvement of aberrantly activated HOTAIR/EZH2/miR-193a feedback loop in progression of prostate cancer.', 'LncRNA XIST facilitates cell growth, migration and invasion via modulating H3 histone methylation of DKK1 in neuroblastoma.', 'Structural assembly of Polycomb group protein and Insight of EZH2 in cancer progression: A review.', 'The molecular mechanisms and therapeutic potential of EZH2 in breast cancer.', 'Nanoconjugated long non-coding RNA MEG3 as a new therapeutic approach for Hepatocellular carcinoma.', 'The Biological Roles and Molecular Mechanisms of Long Non-Coding RNA MEG3 in the Hallmarks of Cancer.', 'A review of current evidence about lncRNA MEG3: A tumor suppressor in multiple cancers.', 'Potential epigenetic molecular regulatory networks in ocular neovascularization.', 'Long non-coding RNA in prostate cancer.']"""

Methods:   In this prospective, single-arm, single-institutional study, 90 mCRPC patients with progressive disease (PD) on second-line hormonal therapy and/or docetaxel chemotherapy were recruited for the study. All patients underwent diagnostic Ga-PSMA-HBED-CC PET/CT, prior to inclusion for therapy. Included patients underwent Lu-PSMA-617 therapy at 8- to 12-weekly intervals. The primary end point was to assess the overall survival. The secondary and cosecondary end points included biochemical response assessment as per the Prostate Cancer Working Group 3 criteria, progression-free survival, radiological and molecular response criteria, clinical response, safety profile, and disease control rates. All the outcome parameters were evaluated in 90 patients except for the radiographic and molecular response, which was evaluated in 69 patients.  Results:   The median age of patients was 66.5 years (range, 30-88 years). The median activity administered per cycle was 3.7 to 8 GBq ranging from 1 to 7 cycles, and patients were followed up over a median duration of 28 months. At 2- to 3-month interval after the first therapy and the end of the assessment, greater than 50% decline in prostate-specific antigen was observed in 32.2% and 45.5%, respectively. Univariate analysis did not reveal any variables such as prior therapies, laboratory parameters, concomitant hormonal therapy, and SUV patient parameters associated with prostate-specific antigen decline. Radiographic response by diagnostic CT revealed partial remission in 23% (16/69), stable disease in 54% (37/69), and PD in 23% (16/69) of patients.

However, the role of α5‑nAChR in prostate cancer cell growth and metastasis is unclear. In the present study, the role of α5‑nAChR in cell proliferation, migration, invasion and apoptosis was investigated by silencing the expression levels of α5‑nAChR in the prostate cancer cell lines DU145 and PC3. A siRNA oligonucleotide targeting α5‑nAChR was designed. The cell proliferation of DU145 and PC3 cell lines was analyzed by the Cell Counting Kit‑8 (CCK‑8) assay. Cell migratory and invasive activities were determined using wound healing and Transwell assays, respectively. Western blot analysis was used to quantify α5‑nAChR, p‑AKT and p‑ERK1/2 levels in DU145 and PC3 cells. Knockdown of α5‑nAChR was associated with decreased cell proliferation, migration, invasion and increased apoptosis.

The use of full volumetric modulated arc therapy arcs versus volumetric modulated arc therapy arcs avoiding the hip implants (skip arcs) was also studied.  Materials and methods:   Six prostate patients with hip prostheses were included in this study. The hip prostheses and the streaking artifacts on the computed tomography images were contoured by a single physician, and full volumetric modulated arc therapy arcs were created in the Pinnacle3 TPS. Copies of each plan were made, and the doses were recalculated with the densities of the prostheses and surrounding tissues overridden. The plans were then exported to Monaco and recalculated using a Monte Carlo dose calculation algorithm, with and without densities of the prosthesis and surrounding tissues overridden.  Results:   With density overrides, Pinnacle3 had a 4.4% error for ion chamber measurements. Monaco was within 0.2% of ion chamber measurement when density overrides were used. On average, when density overrides were used in Pinnacle3 for patient dose calculations, the planning target volume D95 value dropped from 99.3% to 82.7%. Monaco also showed decreased planning target volume coverage when plans were recalculated with correct density information. Full arc plans (with density overrides) for the patient with a bilateral prosthesis provided significant bladder sparing and some rectal sparing compared to skip arc plans.  Conclusion:   When planning for prostate patients with hip prostheses, correct density information for implants and surrounding tissues should be used to optimize the plan and ensure optimal accuracy. If available, a Monte Carlo algorithm should be used as a second check. Full arcs could be used to spare dose to organs at risk, while maintaining adequate planning target volume coverage, when using a Monte Carlo dose calculation algorithm.""","""['Holly M Parenica', 'Panayiotis Mavroidis', 'William Jones', 'Gregory Swanson', 'Niko Papanikolaou', 'Sotirios Stathakis']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Technol Cancer Res Treat""","""['Treatment planning dose accuracy improvement in the presence of dental implants.', 'Independent absorbed-dose calculation using the Monte Carlo algorithm in volumetric modulated arc therapy.', 'Dosimetric study of uniform scanning proton therapy planning for prostate cancer patients with a metal hip prosthesis, and comparison with volumetric-modulated arc therapy.', 'Evaluation of VMAT Planning Strategies for Prostate Patients with Bilateral Hip Prosthesis.', 'High-density dental implants and radiotherapy planning: evaluation of effects on dose distribution using pencil beam convolution algorithm and Monte Carlo method.', 'To Study the Impact of Different Optimization Methods on Intensity-Modulated Radiotherapy and Volumetric-Modulated Arc Therapy Plans for Hip Prosthesis Patients.', 'Monte Carlo modeling of the Elekta Versa HD and patient dose calculation with EGSnrc/BEAMnrc.', 'Accuracy of the doses computed by the Eclipse treatment planning system near and inside metal elements.', 'The application of metal artifact reduction methods on computed tomography scans for radiotherapy applications: A literature review.']"""

When medical treatment is ineffective, surgical resection remains the standard treatment, despite significant risk of adverse events. High-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) is a minimally invasive ablative procedure. Focal One® is a transrectal HIFU (TR-HIFU) device used in prostate cancer treatment. The primary objective of this study was to confirm the feasibility of treatment with TR-HIFU in patients presenting with posterior DIE with rectosigmoid involvement. We also assessed its safety and clinical efficacy in this context.  Methods:   This was a non-controlled, prospective, Phase-I clinical trial in a French University Hospital which is a multidisciplinary center for management of endometriosis. Included were patients older than 25 years, without plans to conceive within 6 months, who presented with a single lesion of posterior DIE, with rectosigmoid invasion, after failure of hormonal therapy. All lesions were assessed preoperatively using transvaginal sonography and magnetic resonance imaging. Patients completed questionnaires on gynecological and intestinal symptoms (similar to a visual analog scale (VAS)), and on quality of life (Medical Outcomes Study 36-item short-form survey (SF-36) and, for the second half of patients recruited, symptom scoring system for constipation (KESS), female sexual function index (FSFI) and endometriosis health profile short-version score (EHP-5)), before, and at 1, 3 and 6 months after, TR-HIFU treatment with a Focal One real-time ultrasound-guided HIFU device.  Results:   Twenty-three consecutive patients were included in the study between September 2015 and October 2019. All 23 lesions were visualized, giving a detection rate of 100%. Twenty lesions were treated ('feasibility rate', 87.0%): in 13 the whole lesion was treated and in seven the lesion was treated partially. The mean duration of the TR-HIFU procedure was 55.6 min. We observed a significant improvement in VAS score at 6 months, with differences relative to preoperative scores as follows, for: dysmenorrhea (-3.6, P = 0.004), dyspareunia (-2.4, P = 0.006), diarrhea (-3.0, P = 0.006), constipation (-3.0, P = 0.002), dyschezia (-3.2, P = 0.003), false urge to defecate (-3.3, P = 0.007), posterior pelvic pain (-3.8, P = 0.002) and asthenia (-3.8, P = 0.002). There was also a significant improvement in the SF-36 score, with an increase at 6 months relative to the preoperative score in both the physical component summary (+ 9.3%, P = 0.002) and mental component summary (+ 10.9%, P = 0.017). No major complications occurred during or after any procedure.  Conclusions:   TR-HIFU therapy for posterior DIE is feasible. If its efficacy and safety are confirmed, it could be a minimally invasive alternative to surgery for the treatment of rectosigmoid endometriosis. © 2019 Authors.

Methods:   The 669 consecutive mCRPC patients of the CATS registry were classified according to their type of progression at initiation of each LET: PSA only (PSA-p), radiological (±PSA) (Radio-p); or clinical (±PSA, ±radiological) progression (Clin-p). Overall survival (OS), the primary endpoint, was calculated from initiation of the first-, second- and third-LET to death for each sequence.  Results:   Median OS was shorter in the Clin-p group compared with the PSA-p group (14-month difference in first line; around 7-month difference in second- and third line). Shorter progression-free survival (PFS) was also observed in Clin-p patients, whatever the treatment is. Clinical progression seemed to be associated with a shorter duration of therapy with androgen receptor-targeted therapy (ART) compared with taxanes.  Conclusions:   Clinical progression at initiation of a LET is associated with poor outcomes including shorter PFS and OS as well as clinical and biological features of aggressive disease.

The relativeness of RNA-seq measurements makes the between-sample normalization of read counts an essential step in differential expression (DE) analysis. In most existing methods, the normalization step is performed prior to the DE analysis. Recently, Jiang and Zhan proposed a statistical method which introduces sample-specific normalization parameters into a joint model, which allows for simultaneous normalization and differential expression analysis from log-transformed RNA-seq data. Furthermore, an ℓ0 penalty is used to yield a sparse solution which selects a subset of DE genes. The experimental conditions are restricted to be categorical in their work.  Results:   In this paper, we generalize Jiang and Zhan's method to handle experimental conditions that are measured in continuous variables. As a result, genes with expression levels associated with a single or multiple covariates can be detected. As the problem being high-dimensional, non-differentiable and non-convex, we develop an efficient algorithm for model fitting.  Conclusions:   Experiments on synthetic data demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing methods in terms of detection accuracy when a large fraction of genes are differentially expressed in an asymmetric manner, and the performance gain becomes more substantial for larger sample sizes. We also apply our method to a real prostate cancer RNA-seq dataset to identify genes associated with pre-operative prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels in patients.""","""['Kefei Liu', 'Li Shen', 'Hui Jiang']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""BMC Bioinformatics""","""['A Unified Model for Joint Normalization and Differential Gene Expression Detection in RNA-Seq Data.', 'A comparison of per sample global scaling and per gene normalization methods for differential expression analysis of RNA-seq data.', 'Benchmarking differential expression analysis tools for RNA-Seq: normalization-based vs. log-ratio transformation-based methods.', 'Statistical detection of differentially expressed genes based on RNA-seq: from biological to phylogenetic replicates.', 'UGM: a more stable procedure for large-scale multiple testing problems, new solutions to identify oncogene.', 'Statistical analysis in metabolic phenotyping.']"""

Methods:   A total of 88 PCa and 31 normal prostate tissue samples were collected after surgical resection. Expression of VIM-AS1 in the samples was detected using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Similarly, the relative level of VIM-AS1 in PCa cell lines to normal prostate cell line was also measured. Lentivirus for up- or down-regulating VIM-AS1 was used to establish the experimental cells. MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide) assay and colony formation assay were utilized to study the proliferation, and wound-healing, and transwell assay was utilized to study the migration and invasion abilities of established cells. Furthermore, western blot was employed to detect the expression of the related proteins.  Results:   VIM-AS1 was expressed significantly higher in PCa tissues comparing with normal prostate tissues. Higher VIM-AS1 expression predicted larger tumor size, metastasis and advanced TNM stage. Inhibition of VIM-AS1 reduced cell proliferation, migration and invasion of PC3 cells but overexpression of VIM-AS1 promoted cell growth, migration and invasion.

Patients and methods:   A retrospective study including consecutive men who underwent prostate biopsy for suspicion of PCa in our center between January 2017 and December 2018 was conducted. Combined biopsies were performed for suspicious MRI and systematic biopsies for nonsuspicious MRI. The primary outcome was to compare the DR of PCa per year. Secondary outcomes included DRs of clinically significant PCa (csPCa) and insignPCa between both years and outcomes of targeted vs systematic biopsies.  Results:   A total of 306 men (152 in 2017 and 154 in 2018) were included.

Treatment of prostate cancer by radiation therapy carries a risk of off-target injury to the membranous urethra causing urethral stenosis. Limited characterization of post-radiation urethral stenosis exists in the literature. We hypothesize that specific histopathologic parameters distinguish this stricture etiology.  Methods:   Eighty-two consecutive patients with membranous urethral stenosis underwent urethroplasty between 2013 and 2018. Seventy specimens (86.4%) were available for evaluation: 51 from patients without radiation exposure and 19 from patients with history of radiation therapy for prostate cancer. All specimens were reviewed by a pathologist blinded to patient/stricture information. Histological scoring system was used for the quantification of collagen density, collagen organization, hyalinized fibrosis, vascular density, spindle-cell change, necrosis, hemorrhage, fat entrapment, vacuolation, acute and chronic inflammation, and foreign-body giant cells. Differences in histologic outcomes between groups were statistically analyzed.  Results:   Post-radiation specimens had a higher collagen density (p = 0.01), higher collagen organization (p = 0.001), increased hyalinized fibrosis (p = 0.03), fat entrapment (p = 0.005) and spindle cell change (p = 0.005) when compared to membranous specimens without prior exposure to radiation. Post-radiation specimens also had a significantly decreased vascularity compared to specimens of non-radiated etiology (p = 0.0005). Fibrous connective tissue degenerative change with vacuolation was pronounced in post-radiation specimens and seldom seen in those without radiation (p = 0.0001).  Conclusions:   Membranous urethral stenosis following radiation demonstrates specific histologic characteristics including vascular loss and increased scarring (collagen density, organization). This histologic grading system may be used in grading severity of radiation damage, and conceivably adopted for correlation with clinical outcomes.""","""['M Hughes', 'T Caza', 'Guanqun Li', 'M Daugherty', 'S Blakley', 'D Nikolavsky']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""World J Urol""","""['The dosimetry of prostate brachytherapy-induced urethral strictures.', 'Urethral stricture rate after prostate cancer radiotherapy : Five-year data of a certified prostate cancer center.', 'Urethral strictures after radiation therapy for prostate cancer.', 'Correlation between prostate brachytherapy-related urethral stricture and peri-apical urethral dosimetry: a matched case-control study.', 'Urethral strictures and the cancer survivor.', 'Comparing the toxicity and disease control rate of radiotherapy for prostate cancer between salvage settings after high-intensity focused ultrasound therapy and initial settings.', 'Presenting signs and symptoms of artificial urinary sphincter cuff erosion.', 'Recurrent vesicourethral anastomotic stenosis following treatment for prostate cancer: an effective endoscopic treatment using bipolar plasma button and triamcinolone.', 'Artificial Urinary Sphincter Complications: Risk Factors, Workup, and Clinical Approach.', 'Current Management of Membranous Urethral Strictures Due to Radiation.']"""

Given the increasingly favorable 10-year life expectancy, MedStar Washington Hospital Center screens heart transplant (HT) candidates for CaP and other malignancies prior to intervention.  Methods:   Men aged 18-90 with available pretransplant Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) who underwent left ventricular assist device (LVAD) and/or HT at MedStar Washington Hospital Center from 2007 to 2018 were identified. Serum PSA, CaP diagnosis, and treatment were captured and analyzed. Survival was analyzed using Kaplan-Meier curves.  Results:   Data were available for 34 patients. Median age was 53 [IQR = 51-58]. Median follow-up was 77 months (95% CI = 40-87 months). Six men had postimplant elevated PSA (5.3; SD = 8.5) and 4 were diagnosed with CaP. Median age of CaP diagnosis was 59 [IQR = 58.5-62).

We present long-term follow-up estimates for second cancer (SC) risk and overall survival (OS) in patients randomized to hormone therapy (ET) alone or combined with 70 Gy prostatic RT in the Scandinavian Prostate Cancer Group-7 (SPCG-7) study. We explored the effect of salvage RT (≥60 Gy to the ET group) and reported causes of death.  Methods and materials:   The SPCG-7 study (1996-2002) was a randomized controlled trial that included 875 men with locally advanced nonmetastatic PC. In this analysis, including data from the Norwegian and Swedish Cancer and Cause of Death registries for 651 Norwegian and 209 Swedish study patients, we estimated hazard ratios (HRs) for SC and death, and cumulative incidences of SC.  Results:   Median follow-up of the 860 (431 ET and 429) ET + RT patients was 12.2 years for SC risk analysis and 12.6 years for the OS analysis. Eighty-three of the Norwegian ET patients received salvage RT, and median time to salvage RT was 5.9 years. We found 125 and 168 SCs in the ET and ET + RT patients, respectively. With ET alone as reference, ET + RT patients had an HR of 1.19 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.92-1.54) for all SCs and 2.54 (95% CI, 1.14-5.69) for urinary bladder cancer (UBC). The total number of UBC was 31 (23 in ET + RT; 8 in ET), and the vast majority (85%) were superficial. The HR for SC in salvage RT patients was 0.48 (95% CI, 0.24-0.94). Median OS was 12.8 (95% CI, 11.8-13.8) and 15.3 (95%, CI 14.3-16.4) years in the ET and ET + RT groups, respectively. Compared with ET alone, the risk of death was reduced in ET + RT patients (HR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.62-0.86) and in ET patients receiving salvage RT (HR, 0.44; 95% CI, 0.30-0.65).  Conclusions:   Although the risk of UBC was increased in PC patients who received RT in addition to ET, this disadvantage is outweighed by the OS benefit of RT confirmed in our study. The risk of SC, and especially UBC, should be discussed with patients and be reflected in follow-up programs.""","""['Bjørg Y Aksnessæther', 'Tor Åge Myklebust', 'Arne Solberg', 'Olbjørn H Klepp', 'Eva Skovlund', 'Solveig Roth Hoff', 'Sophie D Fosså', 'Anders Widmark', 'Jo-Åsmund Lund']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys""","""['In Reply to Sari et\xa0al.', 'In Regard to Aksnessætheret\xa0al.', 'Ten- and 15-yr Prostate Cancer-specific Mortality in Patients with Nonmetastatic Locally Advanced or Aggressive Intermediate Prostate Cancer, Randomized to Lifelong Endocrine Treatment Alone or Combined with Radiotherapy: Final Results of The Scandinavian Prostate Cancer Group-7.', 'Short-term androgen suppression and radiotherapy versus intermediate-term androgen suppression and radiotherapy, with or without zoledronic acid, in men with locally advanced prostate cancer (TROG 03.04 RADAR): 10-year results from a randomised, phase 3, factorial trial.', 'Effect of Standard vs Dose-Escalated Radiation Therapy for Patients With Intermediate-Risk Prostate Cancer: The NRG Oncology RTOG 0126 Randomized Clinical Trial.', 'Prostate-Specific Antigen-Based Screening for Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Evidence Review for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force Internet.', 'A systematic overview of radiation therapy effects in prostate cancer.', 'Effect of Combining Traditional Chinese Medicine with Hormonal Therapy on Quality of Life and Tumor Markers of Prostate Cancer Patients.']"""

Results:   93 practitioners responded, giving a response rate of 8.3%. Eighty GP (86%) responded performing prostate cancer screening.

Thirty two physicians prescribed pMRIs (34.5%.) before any urological consultation. The main indications were several abnormal PSA assays (27 GP, 84.4%) and/or suspicious rectal examination (15 GP, 46.9%).

Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox regression were used to evaluate the impacts of the PLND and its extent on cancer-specific survival (CSS) and overall survival (OS). In overall cohort, patients with PLND were associated with more aggressive clinicopathologic characteristics and had poorer survival compared to those without PLND (5-year CSS rate: 98.4% vs. 99.7%, p < 0.001; 5-year OS rate: 96.3% vs. 97.8%, p < 0.001).

Results:   The essential nodes of the apoptotic pathways, TP53, and CASP3, were identified in both, Paclitaxel and Vincristine networks, but the intrinsic pathway markers BCL2, BAX, and BCL2L1 were identified as hub nodes only in the Paclitaxel network. An in vitro analysis demonstrated an increase in BimEL and the cleaved-caspase-3 proteins in PC-3 cells exposed to both treatments. Immunoprecipitation analysis showed that treatments induced the releasing of Bax from the anti-apoptotic complex with Bcl-2 protein and the role of BimEL as a de-repressor from sequestering complexes, in addition, new protein complexes were identified between BimEL or Bcl-2 and cleaved-caspase-3, contributing data to the Vincristine network for p53-null cells in response to MTAs.

Risk calculators (RCs) such as the European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer (ERSPC) RCs have been developed to predict the outcome of prostate biopsies and have been shown to improve diagnostic accuracy compared to PSA alone. However, it was recently shown that the outcome for high-grade prostate cancer (PCa) upon biopsy tended to be underestimated in men with previous negative biopsies using ERSPC RC model 4. For these men, an individualized approach combining the clinical information with the outcome of biomarker-related urine tests may help to make a more informed decision.  Case presentation:   Two men, aged 66 and 69 respectively when presented in the clinic, show the typical dilemma of urologist and patient for electing repeat prostate biopsy. Both men had normal DRE findings, did not have a family history of PCa, presented with serum PSA values between 3 and 10 ng/ml and the first biopsies were negative for disease. The ERSPC RC4 did not indicate a biopsy in these men. The urinary molecular biomarker-based test for HOXC6 and DLX1, combining biomarker-expression profiling with clinical risk factors, resulted in SelectMDx Risk scores for these men that were higher than the cut-off of the test. Based on this outcome, mpMRI was performed with an outcome of PI-RADS ≥4 in both men. Histopathological evaluation of TRUS-guided biopsies confirmed high-grade PCa.  Conclusions:   The urinary molecular biomarker-based risk score played a pivotal role in the diagnosis of clinically significant PCa whereas ERSPC RC4 outcome would not have indicated further diagnostic follow-up in these two cases.

In the general population, blacks are at a higher risk of VTE compared with whites. The influence of race on cancer-associated VTE remains unexplored. We examined whether black cancer patients are at a higher risk of VTE and whether these differences are present in specific cancer types.  Design:   A retrospective study was performed in the largest safety net hospital of New England using a cohort of cancer patients characterized by a substantial number of nonwhites.  Results:   We identified 16,498 subjects with solid organ and hematologic malignancies from 2004 to 2018. Among them, we found 186 unique incident VTE events, of which the majority of the events accrued within the first 2 years of cancer diagnosis. Overall, blacks showed a 3-fold higher incidence of VTE (1.8%) compared with whites (0.6%; P<0.001). This difference was observed in certain cancer types such as lung, gastric and colorectal. In lung cancer, the odds of developing VTE in blacks was 2.77-times greater than those in white patients (confidence interval, 1.33-5.91; P=0.007). Despite the greater incidence of cancer-associated VTE in blacks, their Khorana risk score of VTE was not higher.  Conclusions:   In a diverse cancer cohort, we observed a higher incidence of cancer-associated VTE in blacks compared with patients from other races. This study indicates the consideration of race in the risk assessment of cancer-associated VTE. It could also lead to future mechanistic studies aiming at identifying reasons for differential VTE risk depending on cancer type.""","""['Nana Oduraa Addo-Tabiri', 'Rani Chudasama', 'Rhythm Vasudeva', 'Orly Leiva', 'Brenda Garcia', 'Jonathan D Ravid', 'Tamala Bunze', 'Linda Rosen', 'Mostafa Belghasem', 'Jean Francis', 'Mary Brophy', 'Brett Johnson', 'Ryan Ferguson', 'Janice Weinberg', 'Vipul C Chitalia']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Am J Clin Oncol""","""['Comparison of characteristics from White- and Black-Americans with venous thromboembolism: a cross-sectional study.', 'Venous Thromboembolism Following Total Knee Arthroplasty: Does\xa0Race Matter?', 'Racial and regional differences in venous thromboembolism in the United States in 3 cohorts.', 'Effects of race and ethnicity on the incidence of venous thromboembolism.', 'Venous thromboembolism in African-Americans: a literature-based commentary.', 'Epidemiology of Cancer-Associated Venous Thromboembolism in Patients With Solid and Hematologic Neoplasms in the Veterans Affairs Health Care System.', 'Risk Assessment for Cancer-Associated VTE: Diversifying the Evidence Base.', 'Cancer-Associated Thrombosis: A New Light on an Old Story.']"""

These genes play a role in prostatic carcinogenesis, but their prognostic significance is still debated. The aim of this study was to determine the prognostic significance of ERG and KPNA2 expression, and their association to early prostate-specific antigen (PSA) biochemical recurrence in advanced PC with lymph node metastases. A series of 65 consecutive pN1 M0 R0 PC samples obtained by radical prostatectomy with lymphadenectomy has been analyzed for ERG and KPNA2 expression by immunohistochemistry. For each case, the following clinical data were collected: age, preoperative serum PSA levels, Gleason grade group, TNM stage, and follow-up. PC recurrence was investigated by serum PSA assay and defined by a PSA concentration >0.2 ng/mL after a nadir of <0.1 ng/mL following radical prostatectomy. ERG-positive staining was found in 25/65 cases (38%), and KPNA2 in 56/65 cases (86%); neither was detected in normal prostatic tissue. Immunohistochemical concordance was found between primary tumor and lymph node metastases in 24/25 (96%) of ERG and 53/56 (95%) of KPNA2-positive cases. The follow-up was known in all cases, and early PSA recurrence occurred in 25/65 cases (38%). ERG positivity, both alone and in conjunction with KPNA2 positivity, was strongly associated with early PSA recurrence [both ERG+ and KPNA+, odds ratio: 22.2 (95% confidence interval, 6.0-82.3); ERG+ alone odds ratio: 17.9 (95% confidence interval, 5.1-63.5); P<0.0001 for both]. KPNA2 expression was significantly associated with the tumor stage (P<0.00001). The results suggest that the ERG+ phenotype might be selected in metastasis-initiating clones. ERG and KPNA2 may have a prognostic value, and their positivity in PC might warrant more aggressive treatments.""","""[""Antonio D'Antonio"", 'Alessandro Caputo', 'Filippo Fraggetta', 'Pietro Pepe', 'Luigi Insabato', 'Enrica Barra', 'Valeria Barresi', 'Vincenzo Altieri', 'Umberto Greco', 'Riccardo Savastano', 'Pio Zeppa']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Appl Immunohistochem Mol Morphol""","""['High nuclear karyopherin α 2 expression is a strong and independent predictor of biochemical recurrence in prostate cancer patients treated by radical prostatectomy.', 'The prognostic impact of high Nijmegen breakage syndrome (NBS1) gene expression in ERG-negative prostate cancers lacking PTEN deletion is driven by KPNA2 expression.', 'Reduced CD147 expression is linked to ERG fusion-positive prostate cancers but lacks substantial impact on PSA recurrence in patients treated by radical prostatectomy.', 'The prognostic role of ERG immunopositivity in prostatic acinar adenocarcinoma: a study including 454 cases and review of the literature.', 'Prognostic value of increased KPNA2 expression in some solid tumors: A systematic review and meta-analysis.']"""

Purpose:   To develop and validate a radiomics model based on multiparametric MRI (mp-MRI) in patients with PSA levels of 4-10 ng/mL to predict prostate cancer (PCa) preoperatively and reduce unnecessary biopsies.  Study type:   Retrospective.  Subjects:   In all, 199 patients with PSA levels of 4-10 ng/mL.  Field strength/sequence:   3T, T2 -weighted, diffusion-weighted, and dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI.  Assessment:   Lesion regions of interest (ROIs) from T2 -weighted, diffusion-weighted, and dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI were annotated by two radiologists. A total of 2104 radiomic features were extracted from the ROI of each patient. A random forest classifier was used to build the radiomics model for PCa in the primary cohort. A combined model was constructed using multivariate logistic regression by incorporating the radiomics signature and clinical-radiological risk factors.  Statistical tests:   For continuous variables, variance equality was assessed by Levene's test and Student's t-test, and Welch's t-test was used to assess between-group differences. For categorical variables, Pearson's chi-square test, Fisher's exact test, or the approximate chi-square test was used to assess between-group differences. P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.  Results:   The combined model incorporating the multi-imaging fusion model, age, PSA density (PSAD), and the PI-RADS v2 score yielded area under the curve (AUC) values of 0.956 and 0.933 on the primary (n = 133) and validation (n = 66) cohorts, respectively. Compared with the clinical-radiological model, the combined model performed better on both the primary and validation cohorts (P < 0.05). Furthermore, the use of the combined model to predict PCa could identify more negative PCa patients than the use of the clinical-radiological model by 18.4%.  Data conclusion:   The combined model was developed and validated to provide potential preoperative prediction of PCa in men with PSA levels of 4-10 ng/mL and might aid in treatment decision-making and reduce unnecessary biopsies.

However, these algorithms are faced with the tradeoff between efficiency and accuracy. The fast algorithms are generally less accurate, while the accurate dose engines are often time consuming. In this work, we try to resolve this dilemma by exploring deep learning (DL) for dose calculation.  Methods:   We developed a new radiotherapy dose calculation engine based on a modified Hierarchically Densely Connected U-net (HD U-net) model and tested its feasibility with prostate intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) cases. Mapping from an IMRT fluence map domain to a three-dimensional (3D) dose domain requires a deep neural network of complicated architecture and a huge training dataset. To solve this problem, we first project the fluence maps to the dose domain using a broad beam ray-tracing (RT) algorithm, and then we use the HD U-net to map the RT dose distribution into an accurate dose distribution calculated using a collapsed cone convolution/superposition (CS) algorithm. The model is trained on 70 patients with fivefold cross validation, and tested on a separate 8 patients.  Results:   It takes about 1 s to compute a 3D dose distribution for a typical 7-field prostate IMRT plan, which can be further reduced to achieve real-time dose calculation by optimizing the network. The average Gamma passing rate between DL and CS dose distributions for the 8 test patients are 98.5% (±1.6%) at 1 mm/1% and 99.9% (±0.1%) at 2 mm/2%. For comparison of various clinical evaluation criteria (dose-volume points) for IMRT plans between two dose distributions, the average difference for dose criteria is less than 0.25 Gy while for volume criteria is <0.16%, showing that the DL dose distributions are clinically identical to the CS dose distributions.  Conclusions:   We have shown the feasibility of using DL for calculating radiotherapy dose distribution with high accuracy and efficiency.""","""['Yixun Xing', 'Dan Nguyen', 'Weiguo Lu', 'Ming Yang', 'Steve Jiang']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Automatic IMRT planning via static field fluence prediction (AIP-SFFP): a deep learning algorithm for real-time prostate treatment planning.', 'Attention-aware 3D U-Net convolutional neural network for knowledge-based planning 3D dose distribution prediction of head-and-neck cancer.', 'Data-driven dose calculation algorithm based on deep U-Net.', 'Knowledge-based radiation treatment planning: A data-driven method survey.', 'Deep Learning for Radiotherapy Outcome Prediction Using Dose Data - A Review.', 'Prediction of dose deposition matrix using voxel features driven machine learning approach.', 'Advances in Automated Treatment Planning.', 'Improving Proton Dose Calculation Accuracy by Using Deep Learning.', 'Machine learning in neuro-oncology: toward novel development fields.', 'A Survey on Deep Learning for Precision Oncology.']"""

Aim:   to evaluate the prognostic value of germline BRCA1/2 and CHEK2 mutations on time to castration-resistance in patients with metastatic PCa (mPCa), receiving hormonal therapy in the first-line systemic treatment.  Materials and methods:   A total of 76 patients with mPCa receiving hormonal therapy with luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone analogue (LHRHa) in N.N. Blokhin National Medical Research Center of Oncology were recruited in our prospective study. All patients were genotyped for germline mutations in the BRCA1/2 and CHEK2 genes by real-time polymerase chain reaction using a set ""OncoGenetics"" (LLC ""Research and Production Company DNA-Technology"", Russia, registration certificate No 2010/08415) and the Sanger sequencing using a set ""Beckman Coulter enomeLab GeXP"". In addition, a histologic grade and volume of metastatic disease were evaluated.  Results:   Pathogenic and possibly pathogenic mutations in the BRCA2 and CHEK2 gene were identified in 19 (25%) patients. No cases of BRCA1 mutations were detected. Median time to castration resistance was significantly lower in BRCA2 and CHEK2 mutation carriers (7.93 mo, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.62-13.25), than in non-carriers (48,66 mo, 95% CI 31.05-68.26, p<0,001).

Discussion:   The results of our study and other publications have confirmed limited efficacy of standard approach to treatment hormone-sensitive mPCa in germline mutation BRCA2 and CHEK2 carriers. However, the main objective of studies was to assess the survival rates in these patients at the stage of castration-resistant mPCa.  Conclusion:   Our results demonstrated that germline BRCA2 and CHEK2 mutations are independent unfavorable predictors in patients with mPCa which are associated with decreased time to castration resistance (HR 3.04, 95% CI 1.63-5.66, p<0.001), particularly in subgroup with low volume metastatic disease (HR 4.59, 95% CI 2.06-10.22, p<0,001).

Inclusion criteria were presence of iatrogenic etiologic factor, open reconstruction or visual internal urethrotomy as a treatment, absence of other etiologic factors. Patients were investigated using the standard protocol. Postoperative follow up time ranged from 14 to 102 months, median 43 months.  Results:   Average stricture length was 5,8+/-4,7 cm (1-24 cm). Primary stricture was diagnosed in 107 (46.5%) patients, while 123 (53.5%) patients with recurrent stricture were treated. Localization of urethral stricture was as following: anterior urethra (62.2%), posterior urethra (12.6%) and combined anterior/posterior strictures (25.2%). Endoscopic surgical procedures were the major cause of iatrogenic US followed by urethral catheterizations, hypospadias repair and surgical/radiation therapy of prostate cancer.

Materials and methods:   The first 50 cases of two robotic surgeons were reviewed retrospectively. Group 1 consisted of the first 50 cases of the surgeon with previous experience as a robotic bedside assistant between September 2016-July 2018, while group 2 included the first 50 cases of the surgeon with no bedside assistant experience between February 2009-December 2009. Groups were examined in terms of demographics, prostate volume, presence of median lobe, prostate specific antigen (PSA), preoperative Gleason score, positive core number, clinical stage, console surgery time, estimated blood loss, postoperative Gleason score, pathological stage, positive surgical margin rate, postoperative complications, length of hospital stay and biochemical recurrence rate.  Results:   Previous abdominal surgery and the presence of median lobe hypertrophy rates were higher in Group 1 than in Group 2 (20% vs. 4%, p=0.014; 24% vs. 6%, p=0.012; respectively). In addition, patients in Group 1 were in a higher clinical stage than those in Group 2 (cT2: 70% vs. 28%, p=0.001).

Materials and methods:   Between 2010-2017, 485 men with localized prostate cancer were treated with conventional radiotherapy schedule with a total dose ≥74Gy using IMRT (231) or 3DCRT (254). Late gastrointestinal (GI) and genitourinary (GU) toxicity were retrospectively evaluated according to modifi ed RTOG criteria. The biochemical control was defi ned by the Phoenix criteria (nadir + 2ng/mL). The comparison between the groups included biochemical recurrence free survival (bRFS), overall survival (OS) and late toxicity.  Results:   With a median follow-up of 51 months (IMRT=49 and 3DRT=51 months), the maximal late GU for ≥ grade- 2 during the entire period of follow-up was 13.1% in the IMRT and 15.4% in the 3DRT (p=0.85). The maximal late GI ≥ grade- 2 in the IMRT was 10% and in the 3DRT 24% (p=0.0001). The 5-year bRFS for all risk groups with IMRT and 3D-CRT was 87.5% vs. 87.2% (p=0.415). Considering the risk-groups no signifi cant difference for low-, intermediate- and high-risk groups between IMRT (low-95.3%, intermediate-86.2% and high-73%) and 3D-CRT (low-96.4%, intermediate-88.2% and high-76.6%, p=0.448) was observed. No signifi cant differences for OS and DMFS were observed comparing treatment groups.

However, image registration errors in commercial software have not been widely reported. Here we evaluated the accuracy of deformable image registration (DIR) by using a physical phantom for MRI.  Methods and materials:   We used the ""Wuphantom"" for end-to-end testing of DIR accuracy for MRI. This acrylic phantom is filled with water and includes several fillable inserts to simulate various tissue shapes and properties. Deformations and changes in anatomic locations are simulated by changing the rotations of the phantom and inserts. We used Varian Velocity DIR software (v4.0) and CT (head and neck protocol) and MR (T1- and T2-weighted head protocol) images to test DIR accuracy between image modalities (MRI vs CT) and within the same image modality (MRI vs MRI) in 11 rotation deformation scenarios. Large inserts filled with Mobil DTE oil were used to simulate fatty tissue, and small inserts filled with agarose gel were used to simulate tissues slightly denser than water (e.g., prostate). Contours of all inserts were generated before DIR to provide a baseline for contour size and shape. DIR was done with the MR Correctable Deformable DIR method, and all deformed contours were compared with the original contours. The Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) and mean distance to agreement (MDA) were used to quantitatively validate DIR accuracy. We also used large and small regions of interest (ROIs) during between-modality DIR tests to simulate validation of DIR accuracy for organs at risk (OARs) and propagation of individual clinical target volume (CTV) contours.  Results:   No significant differences in DIR accuracy were found for T1:T1 and T2:T2 comparisons (P > 0.05). DIR was less accurate for between-modality comparisons than for same-modality comparisons, and was less accurate for T1 vs CT than for T2 vs CT (P < 0.001). For between-modality comparisons, use of a small ROI improved DIR accuracy for both T1 and T2 images.  Conclusion:   The simple design of the Wuphantom allows seamless testing of DIR; here we validated the accuracy of MRI DIR in end-to-end testing. T2 images had superior DIR accuracy compared with T1 images. Use of small ROIs improves DIR accuracy for target contour propagation.""","""['Richard Y Wu', 'Amy Y Liu', 'Jinzhong Yang', 'Tyler D Williamson', 'Paul G Wisdom', 'Lawrence Bronk', 'Song Gao', 'David R Grosshan', 'David C Fuller', 'Gary B Gunn', 'X Ronald Zhu', 'Steven J Frank']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""J Appl Clin Med Phys""","""['Quantifying the accuracy of deformable image registration for cone-beam computed tomography with a physical phantom.', 'A Comparative Evaluation of 3 Different Free-Form Deformable Image Registration and Contour Propagation Methods for Head and Neck MRI: The Case of Parotid Changes During Radiotherapy.', 'The evaluation of a hybrid biomechanical deformable registration method on a multistage physical phantom with reproducible deformation.', 'The potential for an enhanced role for MRI in radiation-therapy treatment planning.', 'Evaluation of DIR algorithm performance in real patients for radiotherapy treatments: A systematic review of operator-dependent strategies.', 'Evaluation of Multisource Adaptive MRI Fusion for Gross Tumor Volume Delineation of Hepatocellular Carcinoma.', 'Clinical Assessment of a Novel Ring Gantry Linear Accelerator-Mounted Helical Fan-Beam kVCT System.', 'Quantitative assessment of intra- and inter-modality deformable image registration of the heart, left ventricle, and thoracic aorta on longitudinal 4D-CT and MR images.', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging Images under Deep Learning in the Identification of Tuberculosis and Pneumonia.', 'Development of a physical geometric phantom for deformable image registration credentialing of radiotherapy centers for a clinical trial.']"""

Materials and methods:   A total of 63 patients diagnosed with PCa who underwent (68Ga)PSMA 11 PET/CT between April 2019 and June 2019 and who had 5th minute and 1st and 2nd hour images were included in the study. Early (5th minute) pelvic region and 1st and 2nd hour full body images were obtained from all patients. The regions of interest (ROI) were drawn from the background tissues and the physiological uptake sites in a way to include the same lesions from primary and metastatic lesions in all three imagings, and SUVmax values, and tumor-background ratio (TBR) were calculated.  Results:   The mean age of the patients was 69.81 ± 8.78 (min/max: 51/91) years. In the 5th minute images, prostate gland and bed were easier to evaluate, because of low bladder activity. However, lymph node evaluation was more difficult due to high vascular activity. In the prostate gland, lymph nodes and bone metastases, both SUVmax values and TBR rates increased with time from the 5th minute (p < 0.001). At the 2nd hour, some lesions became more visible, while decreased activity was observed in some lesions. However, none of the patients required a change in the stage or treatment.  Conclusion:   In conclusion, the 5th minute pelvic images in (68Ga)PSMA 11 PET/CT were helpful in visual evaluation of the prostate gland and bed, while 2nd hour images showed high SUVmax and TBR rates in malignant lesions. As the SUVmax values of benign lesions were found to be lower in the 2nd hour, when compared to the 1st hour, it was thought that the 2nd hour imaging could be used in the additional imaging for suspicious lesions without the need for very long waiting times.""","""['Canan Can', 'Halil Komek']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Ann Nucl Med""","""['More advantages in detecting bone and soft tissue metastases from prostate cancer using 18F-PSMA PET/CT.', 'Normal distribution pattern and physiological variants of 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT imaging.', '68Ga-Labeled Prostate-specific Membrane Antigen Ligand Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography for Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.', 'Gallium-68 Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen PET Imaging.', '68Ga-PSMA-PET/CT Has a Role in Detecting Prostate Cancer Lesions in Patients with Recurrent Disease.']"""

In this study, we evaluated the performance of multiparametric MRI (mpMRI) and mpMRI-TRUS fusion biopsy in hypogonadal patients.  Materials and methods:   Clinical and pathologic data from a prospectively maintained, single-institution database of patients who underwent 3T mpMRI and fusion biopsy between 2007 and 2016 were analyzed. Hypogonadism was defined by an institutional cutoff of serum testosterone ≤ 180 ng/dL; T2, DWI, and DCE scores were calculated from mpMRI. Cancer detection rates were compared by Chi-square tests. Multivariate logistic regression was undertaken to evaluate the impact of hypogonadism on clinically significant cancer detection by systematic and fusion biopsy.  Results:   We included 522 patients in our study who had total testosterone levels measured within 90 days of mpMRI. Of these, 49 (9.4%) were hypogonadal. Median total testosterone was 148 ng/dL (IQR 41) in the hypogonadal group, and 304 ng/dL (IQR 132) in the normogonadal group (p < 0.001). Imaging results were comparable between the hypo and normogonadal groups. In the hypogonadal group, systematic biopsy detected clinically significant cancer in 28.6% of patients compared to 40.8% with fusion biopsy. In the normogonadal cohort, systematic and fusion biopsy detected 37.3% and 43.2% CS cancer, respectively. In the hypogonadal cohort, fusion biopsy detected 12.2% more CS cancers compared to systematic biopsy, while it detected only 5.9% more in the normogonadal cohort. On multivariate analysis, hypogonadism was found to be an independent predictor of decreased CS cancer detection on systematic (p = 0.048), but not on fusion biopsy (p = 0.170).  Conclusions:   Hypogonadism is an independent predictor of lower CS cancer detection on systematic biopsy. However, it fails to significantly impact CS detection on fusion biopsy with comparable cancer detection rates in both groups. Patients with hypogonadism may benefit more from fusion biopsy than normogonadal patients.""","""['Dordaneh Sugano', 'Abhinav Sidana', 'Amit L Jain', 'Brian Calio', 'Sonia Gaur', 'Mahir Maruf', 'Maria Merino', 'Peter Choyke', 'Baris Turkbey', 'Bradford J Wood', 'Peter A Pinto']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Int Urol Nephrol""","""['Multiparametric MRI to improve detection of prostate cancer compared with transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy alone: the PROMIS study.', 'Multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and subsequent MRI/ultrasonography fusion-guided biopsy increase the detection of anteriorly located prostate cancers.', 'Changes in prostate cancer detection rate of MRI-TRUS fusion vs systematic biopsy over time: evidence of a learning curve.', 'Magnetic resonance imaging in prostate cancer detection and management: a systematic review.', 'The Use of Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging (mpMRI) in the Detection, Evaluation, and Surveillance of Clinically Significant Prostate Cancer (csPCa).', 'Application Value of Radiomic Nomogram in the Differential Diagnosis of Prostate Cancer and Hyperplasia.']"""

The purpose of this study was to determine the repeatability of 68Ga-PSMA-HBED-CC in a test-retest trial in subjects with metastatic prostate adenocarcinoma. Methods: Subjects with metastatic prostate cancer underwent 2 PET/CT scans with 68Ga-PSMA-HBED-CC within 14 d (mean, 6 ± 4 d). Lesions in bone, nodes, prostate/bed, and visceral organs, as well as representative normal tissues (salivary glands and spleen), were segmented separately by 2 readers. Absolute and percentage differences in SUVmax and SUVmean were calculated for all test-retest regions. Repeatability was assessed using percentage difference, within-subject coefficient of variation (wCV), repeatability coefficient (RC), and Bland-Altman analysis. Results: Eighteen subjects were evaluated, 16 of whom demonstrated local or metastatic disease on 68Ga-PSMA-HBED-CC PET/CT. In total, 136 lesions were segmented in bone (n = 99), nodes (n = 27), prostate/bed (n = 7), and viscera (n = 3). The wCV for SUVmax was 11.7% for bone lesions and 13.7% for nodes. The RC was ±32.5% SUVmax for bone lesions and ±37.9% SUVmax for nodal lesions, meaning 95% of the normal variability between 2 measurements will be within these numbers, so larger differences are likely attributable to true biologic changes in tumor rather than normal physiologic or measurement variability. wCV in the salivary glands and spleen was 8.9% and 10.7% SUVmean, respectively. Conclusion: Repeatability measurements for PET/CT test-retests with 68Ga-PSMA-HBED-CC showed a wCV of 12%-14% SUVmax and an RC of ±33%-38% SUVmax in bone and nodal lesions. These estimates are an important aspect of 68Ga-PSMA-HBED-CC as a quantitative imaging biomarker. These estimates are similar to those reported for 18F-FDG, suggesting that 68Ga-PSMA-HBED-CC PET/CT may be useful in monitoring response to therapy.""","""['Janet H Pollard', 'Caleb Raman', 'Yousef Zakharia', 'Chad R Tracy', 'Kenneth G Nepple', 'Tim Ginader', 'Patrick Breheny', 'John J Sunderland']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""J Nucl Med""","""['Repeatability of 68Ga-PSMA-HBED-CC PET/CT-Derived Total Molecular Tumor Volume.', '68Ga-PSMA-HBED-CC Uptake in Cervical, Celiac, and Sacral Ganglia as an Important Pitfall in Prostate Cancer PET Imaging.', 'Comparison of (18)FDCFPyL and  (68)GaGa-PSMA-HBED-CC for PSMA-PET Imaging in Patients with Relapsed Prostate Cancer.', 'Prostate-specific membrane antigen positron emission tomography in the management of recurrent prostate cancer.', 'PSMA-radioguided surgery in localized recurrent prostate cancer : Current and future aspects.', 'Prognostic utility of RECIP 1.0 with manual and AI-based segmentations in biochemically recurrent prostate cancer from 68GaGa-PSMA-11 PET images.', 'Novel Framework for Treatment Response Evaluation Using PSMA PET/CT in Patients with Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer (RECIP 1.0): An International Multicenter Study.', 'High SUVs Have More Robust Repeatability in Patients with Metastatic Prostate Cancer: Results from a Prospective Test-Retest Cohort Imaged with 18F-DCFPyL.', 'Bone Metastases Are Measurable: The Role of Whole-Body MRI and Positron Emission Tomography.', 'Is SUV Corrected for Lean Body Mass Superior to SUV of Body Weight in 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT?']"""

Accordingly, discovering and developing new potent treatment strategies for patients with metastatic prostate cancer has been a major research focus during the last few decades. Identifying disease progression, especially within clinical trials, is essential in determining drug effectiveness. One major remaining question is how best to define disease progression. The criteria of the Prostate Cancer Clinical Trials Working Group (PCWG2) include clinical and laboratory parameters, as well as conventional imaging modalities such as MRI, CT, and bone scan findings, but advanced molecular imaging techniques, especially prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) PET findings, are not considered. This is a problem because PSMA PET is used not only for detecting biochemical recurrence but also for restaging and as an intermediate-endpoint biomarker in ongoing clinical trials. Therefore, response criteria and PSMA PET progression (PPP) criteria need to be established with some urgency. The intent of this article is therefore to define prostate cancer progression by PSMA PET criteria. Our PPP proposal is based on the same principles as were applied for the PCGW2 criteria but adds value by including PSMA PET criteria. PPP defines PSMA treatment response using 3 different criteria. The first is the appearance of 2 or more new PSMA-positive distant lesions. The second is the appearance of 1 new PSMA-positive lesion plus consistent clinical or laboratory data and recommended confirmation by biopsy or correlative imaging within 3 mo of PSMA PET. The third is an increase in size or PSMA uptake of 1 or more existing lesions by at least 30%, plus consistent clinical or laboratory data or confirmation by biopsy or correlative imaging within 3 mo of PSMA PET.""","""['Stefano Fanti', 'Boris Hadaschik', 'Ken Herrmann']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""J Nucl Med""","""['68Ga-Labeled Prostate-specific Membrane Antigen Ligand Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography for Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.', 'More advantages in detecting bone and soft tissue metastases from prostate cancer using 18F-PSMA PET/CT.', 'Oligometastases in prostate cancer : Metabolic response in follow-up PSMA-PET-CTs after hypofractionated IGRT.', 'Bridging the Imaging Gap: PSMA PET/CT Has a High Impact on Treatment Planning in Prostate Cancer Patients with Biochemical Recurrence-A Narrative Review of the Literature.', 'PSMA PET and Radionuclide Therapy in Prostate Cancer.', 'Prognostic utility of RECIP 1.0 with manual and AI-based segmentations in biochemically recurrent prostate cancer from 68GaGa-PSMA-11 PET images.', 'Prognostic Implications of PET-Derived Tumor Volume and Uptake in Patients with Neuroendocrine Tumors.', 'Quantitative assessment of PSMA PET response to therapy in castration-sensitive prostate cancer using an automated imaging platform for disease identification and measurement.', 'PET Criteria by Cancer Type from Imaging Interpretation to Treatment Response Assessment: Beyond FDG PET Score.', 'Body composition parameters were associated with response to abiraterone acetate and prognosis in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.']"""

Methods: Sixteen patients were included in this multicenter study. The inclusion criteria were PSMA PET performed for biochemical recurrence before SLND (pre-SLND PET) and repeat PSMA PET performed for a persistently elevated PSA level (≥0.1 ng/mL) at least 6 wk after SLND (post-SLND PET). Image analysis was performed by 3 independent nuclear medicine physicians applying the molecular imaging TNM system PROMISE. Lesions were confirmed by histopathology, presence on correlative CT/MRI/bone scanning, or PSA response after focal therapy. Results: Post-SLND PET identified prostate cancer lesions in 88% (14/16) of patients with PSA persistence after SLND. Median PSA was 1.2 ng/mL (interquartile range, 0.6-2.8 ng/mL). Disease was confined to the pelvis in 56% of patients (9/16), and most of these men had common iliac (6/16, 38%) and internal iliac lymph node metastases (6/16, 38%). Extrapelvic disease was detected in 31% of patients (5/16). In pre- and post-SLND PET comparison, 10 of 16 had at least one lesion already detected at baseline (63% PET persistence), 4 of 16 had new lesions only (25% PET recurrence), and 2 had no disease on post-SLND PET. All validated regions (11 regions in 9 patients) were true-positive. Nine of 14 (64%) patients underwent repeat local therapies after SLND (7/14 radiotherapy, 2/14 surgery). Conclusion: SLND of pelvic nodal metastases was often not complete according to PSMA PET. About two thirds of patients had PET-positive nodal disease after SLND already seen on pre-SLND PSMA PET.

An alternative approach is to take advantage of existing pharmacokinetic data from these smaller cohorts to enable dose computation from a single posttreatment scan in a manner that may be applied to a much broader patient population. Methods: In this work, a technical description of simplified dose estimation is presented and applied to the assessment of 177Lu-prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA)-617 therapy for metastatic prostate cancer. By normalizing existing time-activity curves to a single measurement time, it is possible to calculate a mean and range of time-integrated activity values that relate to absorbed radiation dose. To assist with accurate pharmacokinetic modeling of the training cohort, a method for contour-guided image registration was developed. Results: Tissue-specific dose conversion factors for common posttreatment imaging times are reported along with a characterization of added uncertainty in comparison to a traditional serial imaging protocol. Single-time-point dose factors for tumor were determined to be 11.0, 12.1, 13.6, and 15.2 Gy per MBq/mL at image times of 24, 48, 72, and 96 h, respectively. For normal tissues, parotid gland factors were 6.7, 9.4, 13.3, and 19.3 Gy per MBq/mL at those times, and kidneys were 7.1, 10.3, 15.0, and 22.0 Gy per MBq/mL. Tumor dose estimates were most accurate using delayed scanning at times beyond 72 h. Dose to healthy tissues is best characterized by scanning patients in the first 2 d of treatment because of the larger degree of tracer clearance in this early phase. Conclusion: This work demonstrates a means for efficient dose estimation in 177Lu-PSMA-617 therapy. By providing methods to simplify and potentially automate radiation dosimetry, we hope to accelerate the understanding of radiobiology and development of dose-response models in this unique therapeutic context.""","""['Price A Jackson', 'Michael S Hofman', 'Rodney J Hicks', 'Mark Scalzo', 'John Violet']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""J Nucl Med""","""['Will SPECT/CT Cameras Soon Be Able to Display Absorbed Doses?

Previous clinical reports indicate that PCs with a phenotype similar to neuroendocrine tumors can be more amenable to imaging by 18F-FDG than by PSMA-targeting radioligands. In this study, we evaluated the association between neuroendocrine gene signature and 18F-FDG uptake-associated genes including glucose transporters (GLUTs) and hexokinases, with the goal of providing a genomic signature to explain the reported 18F-FDG avidity of PSMA-suppressed tumors. Methods: Data-mining approaches, cell lines, and patient-derived xenograft models were used to study the levels of 14 members of the SLC2A family (encoding GLUT proteins), 4 members of the hexokinase family (genes HK1-HK3 and GCK), and PSMA (FOLH1 gene) after AR inhibition and in correlation with neuroendocrine hallmarks. Also, we characterize a neuroendocrine-like PC (NELPC) subset among a cohort of primary and metastatic PC samples with no neuroendocrine histopathology. We measured glucose uptake in a neuroendocrine-induced in vitro model and a zebrafish model by nonradioactive imaging of glucose uptake using a fluorescent glucose bioprobe, GB2-Cy3. Results: This work demonstrated that a neuroendocrine gene signature associates with differential expression of genes encoding GLUT and hexokinase proteins. In NELPC, elevated expression of GCK (encoding glucokinase protein) and decreased expression of SLC2A12 correlated with earlier biochemical recurrence. In tumors treated with AR inhibitors, high expression of GCK and low expression of SLC2A12 correlated with neuroendocrine histopathology and PSMA gene suppression. GLUT12 suppression and upregulation of glucokinase were observed in neuroendocrine-induced PC cell lines and patient-derived xenograft models. A higher glucose uptake was confirmed in low-PSMA tumors using a GB2-Cy3 probe in a zebrafish model. Conclusion: A neuroendocrine gene signature in neuroendocrine PC and NELPC associates with a distinct transcriptional profile of GLUTs and hexokinases. PSMA suppression correlates with GLUT12 suppression and glucokinase upregulation. Alteration of 18F-FDG uptake-associated genes correlated positively with higher glucose uptake in AR- and PSMA-suppressed tumors.

Currently, treatment options are limited and few model systems are available to identify new approaches for treatment. We sought to evaluate commonalities between SCNPC and other aggressive neuroendocrine carcinomas to identify therapeutic targets.  Experimental design:   We generated whole transcriptome RNA-sequencing data from AR-active prostate cancers (ARPCs) and SCNPCs from tumors collected at rapid autopsy and two other neuroendocrine carcinomas, Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC), and small-cell lung cancer. We performed cross-tumor comparisons to identify conserved patterns of expression of druggable targets. We tested inhibitors to highly upregulated drug targets in a panel of prostate cancer cell lines and in vivo patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models.  Results:   We identified BCL2 as highly upregulated in SCNPC compared with ARPC. Inhibitors targeting BCL2 induced apoptotic cell death in SCNPC cell lines at nanomolar concentrations while ARPC cell lines were resistant. Treatment with the BCL2 inhibitor navitoclax leads to a reduction of growth of SCNPC PDX tumors in vivo, whereas ARPC PDX models were more resistant. We identified Wee1 as a second druggable target upregulated in SCNPC. Treatment with the combination of navitoclax and the Wee1 inhibitor AZD-1775 repressed the growth of SCNPC PDX resistant to single-agent BCL2 inhibitors.

The TOPARP-B trial aims to prospectively validate the association between DDR gene aberrations and response to olaparib in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.  Methods:   In this open-label, investigator-initiated, randomised phase 2 trial following a selection (or pick-the-winner) design, we recruited participants from 17 UK hospitals. Men aged 18 years or older with progressing metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer previously treated with one or two taxane chemotherapy regimens and with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 2 or less had tumour biopsies tested with targeted sequencing. Patients with DDR gene aberrations were randomly assigned (1:1) by a computer-generated minimisation method, with balancing for circulating tumour cell count at screening, to receive 400 mg or 300 mg olaparib twice daily, given continuously in 4-week cycles until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Neither participants nor investigators were masked to dose allocation. The primary endpoint of confirmed response was defined as a composite of all patients presenting with any of the following outcomes: radiological objective response (as assessed by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors 1.1), a decrease in prostate-specific antigen (PSA) of 50% or more (PSA50) from baseline, or conversion of circulating tumour cell count (from ≥5 cells per 7·5 mL blood at baseline to <5 cells per 7·5 mL blood). A confirmed response in a consecutive assessment after at least 4 weeks was required for each component. The primary analysis was done in the evaluable population. If at least 19 (43%) of 44 evaluable patients in a dose cohort responded, then the dose cohort would be considered successful. Safety was assessed in all patients who received at least one dose of olaparib. This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01682772. Recruitment for the trial has completed and follow-up is ongoing.  Findings:   711 patients consented for targeted screening between April 1, 2015, and Aug 30, 2018. 161 patients had DDR gene aberrations, 98 of whom were randomly assigned and treated (49 patients for each olaparib dose), with 92 evaluable for the primary endpoint (46 patients for each olaparib dose). Median follow-up was 24·8 months (IQR 16·7-35·9). Confirmed composite response was achieved in 25 (54·3%; 95% CI 39·0-69·1) of 46 evaluable patients in the 400 mg cohort, and 18 (39·1%; 25·1-54·6) of 46 evaluable patients in the 300 mg cohort. Radiological response was achieved in eight (24·2%; 11·1-42·3) of 33 evaluable patients in the 400 mg cohort and six (16·2%; 6·2-32·0) of 37 in the 300 mg cohort; PSA50 response was achieved in 17 (37·0%; 23·2-52·5) of 46 and 13 (30·2%; 17·2-46·1) of 43; and circulating tumour cell count conversion was achieved in 15 (53·6%; 33·9-72·5) of 28 and 13 (48·1%; 28·7-68·1) of 27. The most common grade 3-4 adverse event in both cohorts was anaemia (15 [31%] of 49 patients in the 300 mg cohort and 18 [37%] of 49 in the 400 mg cohort). 19 serious adverse reactions were reported in 13 patients. One death possibly related to treatment (myocardial infarction) occurred after 11 days of treatment in the 300 mg cohort.

Increased HEXIM1 expression caused differentiation and inhibited proliferation and metastasis of cancer cells. Historically, HEXIM1 has been experimentally induced with the hybrid polar compound HMBA, but HMBA is a poor clinical candidate due to lack of a known target, poor pharmacological properties, and unfavorable ADMETox characteristics. Thus, HEXIM1 induction is an intriguing therapeutic approach to cancer treatment, but requires better chemical tools than HMBA.  Methods:   We identified and verified KDM5B as a target of HEXIM1 inducers using a chemical proteomics approach, biotin-NeutrAvidin pull-down assays, surface plasmon resonance, and molecular docking. The regulation of HEXIM1 by KDM5B and KDM5B inhibitors was assessed using chromatin immunoprecipitation assays, RT-PCR, western blotting, and depletion of KDM5B with shRNAs. The regulation of breast cancer cell phenotype by KDM5B inhibitors was assessed using western blots, differentiation assays, proliferation assays, and a mouse model of breast cancer metastasis. The relative role of HEXIM1 in the action of KDM5B inhibitors was determined by depleting HEXIM1 using shRNAs followed by western blots, differentiation assays, and proliferation assays.  Results:   We have identified a highly druggable target, KDM5B, which is inhibited by small molecule inducers of HEXIM1. RNAi knockdown of KDM5B induced HEXIM1 expression, thus validating the specific negative regulation of tumor suppressor HEXIM1 by the H3K4me3/2 demethylase KDM5B. Known inhibitors of KDM5B were also able to induce HEXIM1 expression, inhibit cell proliferation, induce differentiation, potentiate sensitivity to cancer chemotherapy, and inhibit breast tumor metastasis.  Conclusion:   HMBA and 4a1 induce HEXIM1 expression by inhibiting KDM5B. Upregulation of HEXIM1 expression levels plays a critical role in the inhibition of proliferation of breast cancer cells using KDM5B inhibitors. Based on the novel molecular scaffolds that we identified which more potently induced HEXIM1 expression and data in support that KDM5B is a target of these compounds, we have opened up new lead discovery and optimization directions.""","""['Monica M Montano', 'I-Ju Yeh', 'Yinghua Chen', 'Chris Hernandez', 'Janna G Kiselar', 'Maria de la Fuente', 'Adriane M Lawes', 'Marvin T Nieman', 'Philip D Kiser', 'James Jacobberger', 'Agata A Exner', 'Matthew C Lawes']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Breast Cancer Res""","""['Aberrant KDM5B expression promotes aggressive breast cancer through MALAT1 overexpression and downregulation of hsa-miR-448.', 'Phosphorylation of the histone demethylase KDM5B and regulation of the phenotype of triple negative breast cancer.', 'Induction of HEXIM1 activities by HMBA derivative 4a1: Functional consequences and mechanism.', 'Histone demethylase lysine demethylase 5B in development and cancer.', 'Targeting histone demethylase KDM5B for cancer treatment.', 'Histone Demethylase Modulation: Epigenetic Strategy to Combat Cancer Progression.', 'Histone Methylases and Demethylases Regulating Antagonistic Methyl Marks: Changes Occurring in Cancer.', 'Re-Expression of ERα and AR in Receptor Negative Endocrine Cancers via GSK3 Inhibition.', 'The Cross Marks the Spot: The Emerging Role of JmjC Domain-Containing Proteins in Myeloid Malignancies.', 'Downregulation of Dihydrotestosterone and Estradiol Levels by HEXIM1.']"""

In the present study, we investigated the chemopreventive and chemotherapeutic potential of luteolin, a flavonoid with antioxidative properties, on prostate cancer, including CRPC. Luteolin inhibited the progression of rat prostate carcinogenesis by induction of apoptosis in a transgenic rat for adenocarcinoma of prostate (TRAP) model. Luteolin decreased cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner and induced apoptosis with the activation of caspases 3 and 7 in both rat (PCai1, established from a TRAP prostate tumor) and human (22Rv1) CRPC cells. Dietary luteolin also suppressed tumor growth via an increase in apoptosis and inhibition of angiogenesis in PCai1 and 22Rv1 xenografts implanted in castrated nude mice. We also focused on androgen receptor splice variant 7 (AR-V7), which contributes to cell proliferation and therapeutic resistance in CRPC. Luteolin dramatically suppressed AR-V7 protein expression in 22Rv1 cells in vitro and ex vivo. Microarray analysis identified MiR-8080, which contains a possible target sequence for AR-V7 3'-UTR, as a gene upregulated by luteolin. MiR-8080 transfection decreased the AR-V7 expression level and the induction of apoptosis in 22Rv1 cells. Furthermore, miR-8080 knockdown canceled luteolin decreasing AR-V7 and the cell growth of 22Rv1. MiR-8080 induced by luteolin intake enhanced the therapeutic effect of enzalutamide on 22Rv1 xenografts under castration conditions.

AR is a hormone-dependent transcription factor, which binds to thousands of sites throughout the human genome to regulate expression of directly responsive genes, including pro-survival genes that enable tumor cells to cope with increased cellular stress. ERN1 and XBP1 - two key players of the unfolded protein response (UPR) - are among such stress-associated genes. Here, we show that XBP1 levels in primary prostate cancer are associated with biochemical recurrence in five independent cohorts. Patients who received AR-targeted therapies had significantly lower XBP1 expression, whereas expression of the active form of XBP1 (XBP1s) was elevated. In vitro results show that AR-induced ERN1 expression led to increased XBP1s mRNA and protein levels. Furthermore, ChIP-seq analysis revealed that XBP1s binds enhancers upon stress stimuli regulating genes involved in UPR processes, eIF2 signaling and protein ubiquitination. We further demonstrate genomic overlap of AR- and XBP1s-binding sites, suggesting genomic conversion of the two signaling cascades. Transcriptomic effects of XBP1 were further studied by knockdown experiments, which lead to decreased expression of androgen-responsive genes and UPR genes. These results suggest a two-step mechanism of gene regulation, which involves androgen-induced expression of ERN1, thereby enhancing XBP1 splicing and transcriptional activity.

Tumor compression of the urinary bladder resulting in LUTS was clinically observed. Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) presenting with LUTS have not been reported before. Herein, we report a patient with extraluminal GIST of the ileum who had LUTS without gastrointestinal symptoms during the clinical course.  Patient concerns:   A 68-year-old man visited the genitourinary outpatient department because of frequent urination with mild dysuria. He also complained of poor appetite, fatigue, and body weight loss of 10 kg over 6 months. A large presacral solid mass lesion compressing the bladder and surrounded by the bowel with gas content was identified through abdominal computed tomography.  Diagnosis:   GIST of the ileum with mesenteric invasion was revealed by pathological examination.  Interventions:   Exploratory laparotomy with removal of the pelvic tumor and segmental resection of the ileum was performed.  Outcomes:   Now, he received adjuvant imatinib target therapy for 1 year with stable condition.

Methods:   A ten-year retrospective study was carried out in two centers (Bologna and Florence) all the patients who developed a SN six months at least after a CTCL were included. Two groups were selected: group 1 featuring patients who developed a SN and group 2 characterized by patients affected by MF age and sex-matched with group 1 (control group). Data concerning any stage change after SN, time between MF and SN onset, modified Severity Weighted Assessment Tool (mSWAT) score before and after SN, concerning Group 1 and after a median time of 36 months in Group 2 were analyzed.  Results:   Thirteen patients were detected. Before SN onset, early MF patients were mainly present, while SN cases in advanced stage (ten patients) were observed. SN type predominant was lung cancer, along with prostate and pancreatic cancer, while isolated cases presenting with vulvar, colon, mammalian, prostate cancer along with Hodgkin's Lymphoma. Mean mSWAT at MF diagnosis and after SN showed a significant difference (P value = 0.0037). After SN diagnosis, nine patients experienced an MF stage progression and ten patients died at follow-up.  Conclusions:   In all the instances, statistical analysis showed that mean mSWAT score before/after SN diagnosis had a significantly difference (P=0.0037) suggesting that patients with a SN may have a worse clinical outcome.

As E2F transcription factor 1 (E2F1) is an essential factor in CRPC, this study investigated the genes and pathways controlled by E2F1 and their effects on cellular behavior in CRPC.  Methods:   In vitro assays were used to evaluate cellular proliferation, apoptosis, and behavior. Cellular expression was quantified by RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). Gene co-expression was assessed using the GeneMANIA database, and correlations were analyzed with the GEPIA server. Altered pathways of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were revealed by functional annotation. Module analysis was performed using the STRING database and hub genes were filtered with the Cytoscape software. Some DEGs were validated by real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR).  Results:   Knockdown of E2F1 significantly inhibited proliferation and accelerated apoptosis in PC3 cells but not in DU145 cells. Invasion and migration were reduced for both cell lines. A total of 1811 DEGs were identified in PC3 cells and 27 DEGs in DU145 cells exhibiting E2F1 knockdown. Ten overlapping DEGs, including TMOD2 and AIF1L, were identified in both knockdown cell lines and were significantly enriched for association with actin filament organization pathways. TMOD2 and KREMEN2 were genes co-expressed with E2F1; six overlapping DEGs were positively correlated with transcription factor E2F1. DEGs of the PC3 and DU145 groups were associated with multiple pathways. Five DEGs that overlapped between the two cell lines and three hub DEGs from PC3 cells were validated by RT-qPCR.  Conclusion:   The results of this study suggest that E2F1 has a critical role in regulating actin filaments, as indicated by the change in expression level of several genes, including TMOD2 and AIF1L, in CRPC.

Positron emission tomography (PET) with prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) is a promising technique that outperformed conventional imaging in the detection of nodal and distant metastases in previous studies. However, it is still unclear whether the superior sensitivity and specificity also translate into improved patient management. The aim of this study was to assess the performance of 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET for staging of intermediate and high-risk prostate cancer and its potential impact on disease management.  Methods:   In this retrospective analysis, 116 patients who underwent 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT or MRI scans for staging of their intermediate or high-risk prostate cancer between April 2016 and May 2018 were included. The potential impact of 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET staging on patient management was assessed within a simulated multidisciplinary tumour board where hypothetical treatment decisions based on clinical information and conventional imaging alone was determined. This treatment decision was compared with the treatment recommendation based on clinical information and 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET imaging.  Results:   The primary tumour was positive on 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET in 113 patients (97%). Nodal metastases were detected in 28 patients (24%) and bone metastases in 14 patients (12%). Compared with clinical staging and conventional imaging, 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET resulted in new information in 42 of 116 patients (36%). In 32 of 116 patients (27%), this information would most likely have changed the management into a different therapy modality (15 patients, 13%) or adjusted treatment details (e.g. modification of radiotherapy field or lymph node dissection template; 17 patients, 14%).

Methods:   We identified previously reported prostate cancer risk factors from the World Cancer Research Fund (WCRF)'s systematic appraisal of the global evidence (2018). We assessed whether each identified risk factor was causally associated with risk of overall (79 148 cases and 61 106 controls) or aggressive (15 167 cases and 58 308 controls) prostate cancer using Mendelian randomization (MR) based on genome-wide association-study summary statistics from the PRACTICAL and GAME-ON/ELLIPSE consortia. We assessed evidence for replication in UK Biobank (7844 prostate-cancer cases and 204 001 controls).  Results:   WCRF identified 57 potential risk factors, of which 22 could be instrumented for MR analyses using single nucleotide polymorphisms. For overall prostate cancer, we identified evidence compatible with causality for the following risk factors (odds ratio [OR] per standard deviation increase; 95% confidence interval): accelerometer-measured physical activity, OR = 0.49 (0.33-0.72; P = 0.0003); serum iron, OR = 0.92 (0.86-0.98; P = 0.007); body mass index (BMI), OR = 0.90 (0.84-0.97; P = 0.003); and monounsaturated fat, OR = 1.11 (1.02-1.20; P = 0.02). Findings in our replication analyses in UK Biobank were compatible with our main analyses (albeit with wide confidence intervals). In MR analysis, height was positively associated with aggressive-prostate-cancer risk: OR = 1.07 (1.01-1.15; P = 0.03).  Conclusions:   The results for physical activity, serum iron, BMI, monounsaturated fat and height are compatible with causality for prostate cancer.

Introduction:   It is now well-established that persistence of Human Papillomavirus (HPV) infection is the strongest epidemiologic factor associated with intraepithelial neoplasia and cancer of cervix, as well as in other related locations such as in the vagina, vulva, anus, oral cavity, etc. A 1999 study indicates that the worldwide HPV prevalence in cervical carcinomas is 99,7 per cent. Multiple factors seem to intervene on cervical carcinogenesis, many of them related to tobacco, especially by direct local carcinogenic effect and local immunosuppression. Many studies have also shown that active or passive smoking in women (family-work environment, meeting places, etc.) greatly affects the occurrence, progression and degree of malignancy of carcinogenesis. Furthermore, particularly increased levels of nicotine and cotinine in the cervical mucus as well as prostate sperm fluids and urinary cotinine:creatinine ratios in smokers and passive smokers indicate that tobacco constituents do indeed reach the uterine cervix and lead to increased modification of DNA in cervical epithelium, suggesting biochemical evidence consistent with smoking as a cause of cervical cancer. The research presented today, though it took place over 30 decades ago (1975-1986 at the University Gynecological and Obstetric Clinic of Homburg ad Saar), we hope will serve as a reminder and contributing factor for further examination of the increased risk of cervical cancer in non-smoking women living with smoking partners.  Study:   The study analyzed a total of one thousand five-hundred and forty (1,540) medical history sheets (krankenblätter) of women aged from eighteen to seventy-four (18-74) years old that were admitted, treated, examined (PAP TEST) or referred for further tests by their family physicians to the Homburg ad Saar Clinic between 1975-1986. The study evaluated the general medical history of the 1,540 women with a special focus on gynecological and obstetric related data and gathered additional information from patients through written questionnaires completed via phone, mail or personal interviews. Among a range of factors and data studied during the research, our current presentation and discussion will focus on the development of cervical neoplasms in women, examining results from three different study groups: smokers, passive-smokers and women with smoking sexual partners.  Results:   Five hundred and forty-four cases (544) out of the overall study sample of one thousand five-hundred and forty (1,540) women, were identified as cases with pathological cell abnormalities (35.32%). Following diagnosis and treatment of transient lesions due to various inflammations (vaginitis, cervicitis etc.) one hundred and twelve (112) cases (20.59%) showed varying degrees of mild/reversible up to CIN 1-3 intraepithelial lesions. From the above sample of one hundred and twelve 112 cases, nineteen cases (19) were smoke free women who never smoked themselves, were not exposed to passive smoking and had non-smoker partners (16.96%). Forty-four (44) cases (39.29%) were female smokers, twenty-two (22) cases (19.64%) were women exposed to regular passive smoking (family-work environment) with a smoke-free partner and twenty-seven (27) cases (24.11%) were women non-smokers with a smoker partner. From the above findings, intraepithelial lesions were found to be higher (and with a progressive malign ratio) on the study groups that were associated with tobacco use either active or passive and therefore, the synergistic harmful effect of smoking, progressively from passive smokers to active smokers, is clearly evident on the occurrence and progression of cervical malignancies. As already mentioned above, the presence of HPV has been widely proven to be almost exclusively the cause of different degrees of neoplasia in the cervix for more than 99.7% of cervical carcinogenesis. However, the harmful effects of a) active smoking, b) passive smoking and c) the exposure to tobacco constituents through an active smoker partner, in women, should be sought and possibly attributed to the catalytic reduction of cervical self-defense and overall cervical immunity disruption which results to the exposure of cervix to elevated levels of nicotine-cotinine and cancer-causing chemicals related to smoking, may work together with certain types of HPV limiting the natural ability of the cervix to defend against carcinogenesis and therefore increase the likelihood of developing cancer.  Conclusion:   Since the almost exclusively cause of cervical neoplasms is due to the presence and carcinogenic activity of HPV, the harmful/synergistic effect of smoking, passive smoking and partner smoking cannot be attributed to the direct carcinogenic effect of nicotine but to the overall damage of the immune system as we as the reduction of cervical self-defense making it more vulnerable to the carcinogenic nature of HPV, in particular the increased pathogenic types 16 and 18. Lastly, another potential correlation that could be further examined is the potential effects of tobacco constituents in cervical fluids on the self-defense system of the male reproductive system.""","""['Ap G Siokos', 'O Siokou-Siova', 'I Tzafetas']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Hell J Nucl Med""","""['Nicotine and cotinine in the cervical mucus of smokers, passive smokers, and nonsmokers.', 'Young women, cervical intraepithelial neoplasia and human papillomavirus: risk factors for persistence and recurrence.', 'Genetic damage in exfoliated cells of the uterine cervix.

Its administration is based on a schedule of intravenous injection (55kBq/kg) every four weeks for up to six cycles. Because the biological effectiveness of 223Ra-therapy is dose-dependent, the main goal is to complete the entire treatment to achieve a better patient outcome. This study aims to identify potential pre-treatment variables that could impact on 223Ra-treatment completion and then be used to improve the clinical and supportive management of mCRPC patients.  Materials and methods:   30 consecutive mCRPC patients (mean age 77 years old), who were admitted for Ra223-therapy at our Department from February 2016 to October 2018, were enrolled for the analysis. The population was grouped as patients who completed 223Ra-therapy (group Ra223-C) and patients who do not (group 223Ra-U). For each group, we analyzed the effects of potential pre-treatment variables (age, Gleason Score, tumor burden, ""Time From Diagnosis To 223Ra therapy"", type and number of previous treatments, hemoglobin level, Alkaline Phosphatase, Prostate Specific Antigen and pain) on the Ra223-therapy completion. Statistical analysis was performed to evaluate the association between the completion of 223Ra therapy and the variables examined.  Results:   16/30 (53%) patients were 223Ra-C, conversely 14/30 (47%) patients were 223Ra-U because of an early interrupted treatment. A statistically significant association was found only with tumor burden: 68.7% of patients who completed 223-therapy had less than 20 bone metastases (χ2=4.821, p=0.028).  Conclusion:   Our preliminary analysis demonstrates that the high tumor burden represents the most important pre-treatment factor that could affect treatment completion and that needs to be considered before starting 223Ra-therapy to achieve a better outcome in mCRPC patients.""","""['V Lavelli', 'A G Nappi', 'P Caputo', 'A N Asabella', 'M Fanelli', 'A Sardaro', 'C Altini', 'C Ferrari', 'Giuseppe Rubini']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Hell J Nucl Med""","""['Three-year follow-up of a phase II study of radium-223 dichloride in Japanese patients with symptomatic castration-resistant prostate cancer and bone metastases.', 'A Retrospective Analysis of the First 41 mCRPC Patients with Bone Pain Treated with Radium-223 at the National Institute of Oncology in Hungary.', 'Optimal usage of radium-223 in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Radium-223 in asymptomatic patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer and bone metastases treated in an international early access program.', 'Radium-223 for the treatment of bone metastases in castration-resistant prostate cancer: when and why.', 'Outcomes and Factors Associated with Completion of Radium-223 Therapy.', 'Real-world patient characteristics associated with survival of 2 years or more after radium-223 treatment for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (EPIX study).']"""

The inclusion of a systematic biopsy (SB) is also still recommended with predominant sampling within the posterior/peripheral zone of the prostate. The aim of this study was (I) to evaluate PCa detection rates using a modified 10 core SB template including anterior biopsies in combination with mpMRI/ultrasound fusion-guided targeted biopsy (TB) in patients with 3 or more negative prebiopsies and (II) to compare mpMRI index lesion localization with histologically confirmed locali-zation from associated prostatectomy samples.  Methods:   Overall 1,337 consecutive patients underwent sensor-based registration TB of the prostate and a subsequent 10-core SB between January 2012 and December 2015 at our institution. For this study, 101 patients with ≥3 negative prebiopsies and prostate imaging - reporting data system lesions ≥3 were pooled prospectively and underwent TB and a modified SB including 2 ventral (anterior) biopsies. Detection rates were estimated for the modified SB, TB, and its combination. A subgroup analysis of 35 patients undergoing prostatectomy was performed by a head-to-head comparison of mpMRI index lesion and histologically confirmed PCa index lesion localization.  Results:   The overall detection rate for PCa was 54.5%. The combination of TB and SB detected 14 (25.4%) more cases missed by TB alone (p < 0.001) and 7 (12.7%) more cases missed by SB alone (p = 0.016), respectively. A postoperative Gleason upgrade was seen in 12/35 (34.3%) cases within the TB group and in 14/35 (40.0%) in the SB group, respectively. The subgroup analysis showed a predominant location of PCa index lesions anteriorly at the level of the midgland. The MRI detection rate of the anteriorly located index lesions was 70.4% (15/21 cases) with a clinically significant Gleason score (≥3 + 4 = 7a [International Society of Urological Pathology grade 2]) in 80.9%. Interestingly a modified SB template detected 90.5% (19/21) of the anteriorly located index lesions.

Urban men were most likely to have had brachytherapy, with three times greater odds of treatment than farm men (OR 2.90; 95% CI 1.51, 5.56). Urban women were most likely to have had chemotherapy for breast cancer, having twice the odds of receiving this treatment as farm women (OR 2.24; 95% CI 1.25, 4.04). The odds of chemotherapy for colorectal cancer among rural nonfarm residents were two-thirds the odds among urban men (OR 0.62; 95% CI 0.44, 0.90) and urban women (OR 0.57; 95% CI 0.37, 0.88). Age, distance, income and health insurance factors contributed to differences in nonsurgical care between groups.  Conclusions:   Cancer-related surgical services for breast and colorectal cancer were comparable between groups. Farm and rural nonfarm residents may have been disadvantaged in relation to nonsurgical therapies for prostate, breast and colorectal cancer compared with urban counterparts.""","""['Julie Depczynski', 'Timothy Dobbins', 'Bruce Armstrong', 'Tony Lower']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Public Health Res Pract""","""['Stage of diagnosis of prostate, breast and colorectal cancer in farm residents compared with other rural and urban residents in New South Wales.', 'Comparison of cancer incidence in Australian farm residents 45 years and over, compared to rural non-farm and urban residents - a data linkage study.', ""Psychosocial work characteristics predict cardiovascular disease risk factors and health functioning in rural women: the Wisconsin Rural Women's Health Study."", 'Prostate cancer incidence and mortality in rural men--a systematic review of the literature.', 'The impact of informal care giving on labor force participation by rural farming and nonfarming families.', 'Cancer survival differentials for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples in Queensland: the impact of remoteness.', 'Reconceptualising Rural Cancer Inequalities: Time for a New Research Agenda.']"""

Detection of circRNAs in PCa cells showed that circ_KATNAL1 is down-regulated, mainly located in the cytoplasm, and contains multiple binding sites of miR-145-3p, which is an anticancer miRNA. RNA immunoprecipitation with anti-AGO2 antibody, RNA pull-down assays with biotin-labeled circ_KATNAL1 probe or an miR-145-3p mimic, and dual luciferase reporter gene assays confirmed that circ_KATNAL1 binds directly to miR-145-3p in cells, and that WISP1, which is highly expressed in many types of tumors, is an important target gene of miR-145-3p. Circ_KATNAL1 and miR-145-3p promote each other's expression, and down-regulate the expression of the target gene WISP1. Both circ_KATNAL1 and miR-145-3p inhibit cell proliferation, invasiveness, and migration, down-regulate the expression of MMP-2 and MMP-9, promote cell apoptosis and the activation of caspase-3, caspase-8, caspase-9, and PARP, whereas WISP1 has the opposite effect, and the above-mentioned functions of circ_KATNAL1 were achieved through the miR-145-3p/WISP1 pathway.

However, aspirin efficacy may be influenced by biological characteristics, such as obesity and age. With the increasing prevalence of obesity and conflicting data regarding the effect of aspirin in older adults, understanding the potential association of aspirin use with cancer mortality according to body mass index (BMI) and age is imperative.  Objectives:   To investigate the association of aspirin use with risk of all-cause, any cancer, gastrointestinal (GI) cancer, and colorectal cancer (CRC) mortality among older adults and to perform an exploratory analysis of the association of aspirin use with mortality stratified by BMI.  Design, setting, participants:   This cohort study evaluated aspirin use among participants aged 65 years and older in the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer Screening Trial at baseline (November 8, 1993, to July 2, 2001) and follow-up (2006-2008). Analysis began in late 2018 and was completed in September 2019.  Main outcomes and measures:   All-cause, any cancer, GI cancer, or CRC mortality. Multivariable hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs were calculated using time-varying Cox proportional hazards regression modeling, adjusting for additional factors.  Results:   A total of 146 152 individuals (mean [SD] age at baseline, 66.3 [2.4] years; 74 742 [51.1%] women; 129 446 [88.6%] non-Hispanic white) were included in analysis. The median (interquartile range) follow-up time was 12.5 (8.7-16.4) years, encompassing 1 822 164 person-years. Compared with no use, aspirin use 1 to 3 times per month was associated with reduced risk of all-cause mortality (HR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.80-0.88; P < .001) and cancer mortality (HR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.81-0.94; P < .001). Aspirin use 3 or more times per week was associated with decreased risk of mortality of all causes (HR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.80-0.83; P < .001), any cancer (HR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.81-0.88; P < .001), GI cancer (HR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.66-0.84; P < .001), and CRC (HR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.61-0.84; P < .001). When stratified by BMI (calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared), aspirin use 3 or more times per week among individuals with BMI 20 to 24.9 was associated with reduced risk of all-cause mortality (HR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.78-0.85; P < .001) and any cancer mortality (HR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.79-0.82; P < .001). Among individuals with BMI 25 to 29.9, aspirin use 3 or more times per week was associated with reduced risk of all-cause mortality (HR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.79-0.85; P < .001), any cancer mortality (HR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.81-0.91; P < .001), GI cancer mortality (HR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.60-0.86; P < .001), and CRC mortality (HR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.51-0.85; P = .001).

Methods and results:   Data from 6 563 255 patients presenting with an AMI between 2004 and 2014 from the US National Inpatient Sample (NIS) database were analysed. A total of 5 966 955 had no cancer, 186 604 had current cancer, and 409 697 had a historical diagnosis of cancer. Prostate, breast, colon, and lung cancer were the four most common types of cancer. Patients with cancer were older with more comorbidities. Differences in invasive treatment were noted, 43.9% received percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in patients without cancer, whilst only 21.0% of patients with lung cancer received PCI. Lung cancer was associated with the highest in-hospital mortality [odds ratio (OR) 2.71, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.62-2.80], major adverse cardiovascular and cerebrovascular complications (OR 2.38, 95% CI 2.31-2.45), and stroke (OR 1.91, 95% CI 1.80-2.02), while colon cancer was associated with highest risk of bleeding (OR 2.82, 95% CI 2.68-2.98). Irrespective of the type of cancer, presence of metastasis was associated with worse in-hospital outcomes, and historical cancer did not adversely impact on survival (OR 0.90, 95% CI 0.89-0.91).  Conclusion:   A concomitant cancer diagnosis is associated with a conservative medical management strategy for AMI, and worse clinical outcomes, compared to patients without cancer. Survival and clinical outcomes in the context of AMI vary significantly according to the type of cancer and metastasis status.

The aim of the study was to compare the effects of cabazitaxel and androgen deprivation treatments in a prostate tumor xenograft model expressing high levels of constitutively active AR-V7. Furthermore, mechanisms behind acquired cabazitaxel resistance were explored.  Methods:   Mice were subcutaneously inoculated with 22Rv1 cells and treated with surgical castration (n = 7), abiraterone (n = 9), cabazitaxel (n = 6), castration plus abiraterone (n = 8), castration plus cabazitaxel (n = 11), or vehicle and/or sham operation (n = 23). Tumor growth was followed for about 2 months or to a volume of approximately 1000 mm3 . Two cabazitaxel resistant cell lines; 22Rv1-CabR1 and 22Rv1-CabR2, were established from xenografts relapsing during cabazitaxel treatment. Differential gene expression between the cabazitaxel resistant and control 22Rv1 cells was examined by whole-genome expression array analysis followed by immunoblotting, immunohistochemistry, and functional pathway analysis.  Results:   Abiraterone treatment alone or in combination with surgical castration had no major effect on 22Rv1 tumor growth, while cabazitaxel significantly delayed and in some cases totally abolished 22Rv1 tumor growth on its own and in combination with surgical castration. The cabazitaxel resistant cell lines; 22Rv1-CabR1 and 22Rv1-CabR2, both showed upregulation of the ATP-binding cassette sub-family B member 1 (ABCB1) efflux pump. Treatment with ABCB1 inhibitor elacridar completely restored susceptibility to cabazitaxel, while treatment with AR-antagonists bicalutamide and enzalutamide partly restored susceptibility to cabazitaxel in both cell lines. The cholesterol biosynthesis pathway was induced in the 22Rv1-CabR2 cell line, which was confirmed by reduced sensitivity to simvastatin treatment.  Conclusions:   Cabazitaxel efficiently inhibits prostate cancer growth despite the high expression of constitutively active AR-V7. Acquired cabazitaxel resistance involving overexpression of efflux transporter ABCB1 can be reverted by bicalutamide or enzalutamide treatment, indicating the great clinical potential for combined treatment with cabazitaxel and anti-androgens.""","""['Erik Bovinder Ylitalo', 'Elin Thysell', 'Camilla Thellenberg-Karlsson', 'Marie Lundholm', 'Anders Widmark', 'Anders Bergh', 'Andreas Josefsson', 'Maria Brattsand', 'Pernilla Wikström']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Androgens modify therapeutic response to cabazitaxel in models of advanced prostate cancer.', 'Rapid induction of androgen receptor splice variants by androgen deprivation in prostate cancer.', 'Niclosamide enhances abiraterone treatment via inhibition of androgen receptor variants in castration resistant prostate cancer.', 'Exploitation of the Androgen Receptor to Overcome Taxane Resistance in Advanced Prostate Cancer.', 'Androgen receptor splice variants in the era of enzalutamide and abiraterone.', 'Three-in-one: exploration of co-encapsulation of cabazitaxel, bicalutamide and chlorin e6 in new mixed cyclodextrin-crosslinked polymers.', 'Transcriptomic Profiling Analysis of Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer Cell Lines Treated with Chronic Intermittent Hypoxia.', 'Abiraterone induces SLCO1B3 expression in prostate cancer via microRNA-579-3p.', 'Prediction of Synergistic Drug Combinations for Prostate Cancer by Transcriptomic and Network Characteristics.']"""

However, the expression and function of the lncRNA prostate cancer-associated non-coding RNA 1 (PRNCR1) in breast cancer remains unclear. Reverse transcription-quantitative PCR was performed to measure the levels of mRNA expression. Cell counting kit-8, flow cytometry, wound healing and Transwell assays were also performed to study cell proliferation, cell cycle, migration and invasion, respectively. The results of the present study revealed that PRNCR1 expression levels were higher in breast cancer tissues compared with adjacent normal tissues in a patient study. It was also determined that high expression of PRNCR1 was significantly associated with advanced clinical stage, positive metastasis and poor prognosis for patients with breast cancer. In vitro experiments determined that PRNCR1 was significantly upregulated in the breast cancer cell lines BT-549, MCF-7, SK-BR-3 and MDA-MB-231 compared with the normal human breast cell line, MCF-10A. Silencing of PRNCR1 significantly inhibited the proliferation, colony formation, cell cycle progression, migration and invasion of SK-BR-3 and BT-549 cells, while cell apoptosis was induced. In addition, knockdown of PRNCR1 suppressed epithelial-mesenchymal transition in SK-BR-3 and BT-549 cells. In summary, the present results demonstrated that lncRNA PRNCR1 was significantly upregulated in breast cancer and was associated with cancer progression and poor patient prognosis. In vitro experiments determined that knockdown of PRNCR1 inhibited the malignant phenotypes of breast cancer cells. Taken together, the results indicated that PRNCR1 may be used as a potential therapeutic target for patients with breast cancer.""","""['Qian Guo', 'Shuang Lv', 'Bingping Wang', 'Yinbing Li', 'Nier Cha', 'Ruigang Zhao', 'Wenhua Bao', 'Baoqing Jia']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Exp Ther Med""","""['PRNCR1: a long non-coding RNA with a pivotal oncogenic role in cancer.', 'Long non-coding RNA BANCR indicates poor prognosis for breast cancer and promotes cell proliferation and invasion.', 'Long non-coding RNA GHET1 promotes human breast cancer cell proliferation, invasion and migration via affecting epithelial mesenchymal transition.', 'Upregulation of long non-coding RNA PRNCR1 in colorectal cancer promotes cell proliferation and cell cycle progression.', 'A review on the role of PRNCR1 in human disorders with an especial focus on cancer.', 'Coding roles of long non-coding RNAs in breast cancer: Emerging molecular diagnostic biomarkers and potential therapeutic targets with special reference to chemotherapy resistance.', 'PRNCR1: a long non-coding RNA with a pivotal oncogenic role in cancer.', 'Long non-coding RNA NKILA regulates expression of HSP90α, NF-κB and β-catenin proteins in the MCF-7 breast cancer cell line.', 'Long non-coding RNA polymorphisms on 8q24 are associated with the prognosis of gastric cancer in a Chinese population.']"""

Loss of Vaccinia-H1 related phosphatase (VHR) has been shown to arrest at the G1-S and G2-M transitions of the cell cycle, and to increases cell death of prostate cancer cells through JNK activation, suggesting that VHR can be considered as an anticancer target. In this study, 658 natural products were screened through in vitro enzyme assay to identify VHR inhibitor. Among the VHR-inhibitory compounds, 1,2,3,4,6-O-pentagalloylglucose (PGG) was selected for further study as it has been reported to show antitumor effects against tumor model mice, but its direct target has not been identified. PGG inhibited the catalytic activity of VHR (Ki =53 nm) in vitro. Furthermore, the incubation of HeLa cervical cancer cells with PGG dramatically decreased cell viability and markedly increased the protein levels of the cleaved PARP, a hallmark of apoptosis. In addition, treatment of HeLa cells with PGG significantly reduced the protein levels of cyclin D1, Bcl-2 and STAT3 phosphorylation.

Results:   uPA, uPAR, and PAI-1 were overexpressed in 1012 (32.4%), 1271 (40.7%), and 1311 (42%) patients, respectively. uPA overexpression was associated with all clinicopathologic characteristics of biologically aggressive PCa.

Methods:   This retrospective longitudinal observational study included patients with localised prostate cancer who were treated with intensity-modulated radiation therapy in an oncology unit in Hong Kong between January 2007 and December 2011, and who had >1 year of follow-up. Clinical, pharmacological, and radiation parameters were recorded. Toxicities were measured by Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.  Results:   In total, 232 patients were included in this analysis. The mean follow-up time was 7.3 ± 2.1 years and 46.5% of the patients had late rectal toxicities. Late proctitis occurred in 30.5% of patients; 25% of the patients with late proctitis exhibited grade ≥2 toxicity. Median onset times for late proctitis and rectal bleeding were 15 and 18.4 months, respectively. Multivariable regression showed increased odds for the occurrence of late proctitis in patients with older age (odds ratio [OR]=1.11, 95% confidence interval [CI]=1.04-1.19, P=0.003), higher V70 (OR=1.08, 95% CI=1.01-1.15, P=0.027), and presence of acute rectal toxicities (OR=4.47, 95% CI=2.37-8.43, P<0.001).

BRCA2, a DDR and cancer susceptibility gene, is frequently deleted (homozygous and heterozygous) in men with aggressive prostate cancer. Here we show that patients with prostate cancer who have lost a copy of BRCA2 frequently lose a copy of tumor suppressor gene RB1; importantly, for the first time, we demonstrate that co-loss of both genes in early prostate cancer is sufficient to induce a distinct biology that is likely associated with worse prognosis.  Experimental design:   We prospectively investigated underlying molecular mechanisms and genomic consequences of co-loss of BRCA2 and RB1 in prostate cancer. We used CRISPR-Cas9 and RNAi-based methods to eliminate these two genes in prostate cancer cell lines and subjected them to in vitro studies and transcriptomic analyses. We developed a 3-color FISH assay to detect genomic deletions of BRCA2 and RB1 in prostate cancer cells and patient-derived mCRPC organoids.  Results:   In human prostate cancer cell lines (LNCaP and LAPC4), loss of BRCA2 leads to the castration-resistant phenotype. Co-loss of BRCA2-RB1 in human prostate cancer cells induces an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, which is associated with invasiveness and a more aggressive disease phenotype. Importantly, PARP inhibitors attenuate cell growth in human mCRPC-derived organoids and human CRPC cells harboring single-copy loss of both genes.  Conclusions:   Our findings suggest that early identification of this aggressive form of prostate cancer offers potential for improved outcomes with early introduction of PARP inhibitor-based therapy.See related commentary by Mandigo and Knudsen, p. 1784.""","""['Goutam Chakraborty', 'Joshua Armenia', 'Ying Z Mazzu', 'Subhiksha Nandakumar', 'Konrad H Stopsack', 'Mohammad O Atiq', 'Kazumasa Komura', 'Lina Jehane', 'Rahim Hirani', 'Kalyani Chadalavada', 'Yuki Yoshikawa', 'Nabeela A Khan', 'Yu Chen', 'Wassim Abida', 'Lorelei A Mucci', 'Gwo-Shu Mary Lee', 'Gouri J Nanjangud', 'Philip W Kantoff']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Clin Cancer Res""","""['Double Trouble: Concomitant RB1 and BRCA2 Depletion Evokes Aggressive Phenotypes.', 'Double Trouble: Concomitant RB1 and BRCA2 Depletion Evokes Aggressive Phenotypes.', 'Attenuation of SRC Kinase Activity Augments PARP Inhibitor-mediated Synthetic Lethality in BRCA2-altered Prostate Tumors.', 'BRCA2, ATM, and CDK12 Defects Differentially Shape Prostate Tumor Driver Genomics and Clinical Aggression.', 'A Japanese case of castration-resistant prostate cancer with BRCA2 and RB1 co-loss and TP53 mutation: a case report.', 'DNA repair defects in prostate cancer: impact for screening, prognostication and treatment.', 'Molecular landscape of prostate cancer: implications for current clinical trials.', 'Leukocytic Infiltration of Intraductal Carcinoma of the Prostate: An Exploratory Study.', 'Use of PARP inhibitors in prostate cancer: from specific to broader application.', 'BET Inhibition Sensitizes Immunologically Cold Rb-Deficient Prostate Cancer to Immune Checkpoint Blockade.', 'Estimating copy number to determine BRCA2 deletion status and to expect prognosis in localized prostate cancer.', 'Biomarkers for the Detection and Risk Stratification of Aggressive Prostate Cancer.']"""

The aim of this work is to evaluate the function of a kinesin protein, KIF4A, in regulating AR/AR-V7 in prostate cancer endocrine therapy resistance.  Experimental design:   We examined KIF4A expression in clinical prostate cancer specimens by IHC. Regulated pathways were investigated by qRT-PCR, immunoblot analysis, immunoprecipitation, and luciferase reporter and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays. A series of functional analyses were conducted in cell lines and xenograft models.  Results:   Examination of the KIF4A protein and mRNA levels in patients with prostate cancer showed that increased expression of KIF4A was positively correlated with androgen receptor (AR) levels. Patients with lower tumor KIF4A expression had improved overall survival and disease-free survival. Mechanistically, KIF4A and AR form an auto-regulatory positive feedback loop in prostate cancer: KIF4A binds AR and AR-V7 and prevents CHIP-mediated AR and AR-V7 degradation; AR binds the promoter region of KIF4A and activates its transcription. KIF4A promotes castration-sensitive and castration-resistant prostate cancer cell growth through AR- and AR-V7-dependent signaling. Furthermore, KIF4A expression is upregulated in enzalutamide-resistant prostate cancer cells, and KIF4A knockdown effectively reverses enzalutamide resistance and enhances the sensitivity of CRPC cells to endocrine therapy.

We hypothesized a PBx showing multiple cores of cancer with more volume cancer per core would represent more aggressive disease. We propose the Weighted Gleason Grade Group (WGGG), a novel scoring system that synthesizes all histopathologic data and cancer volume into a single numeric value representing the entire PBx, allowing for improved prediction of adverse pathology and risk of biochemical recurrence (BCR) following radical prostatectomy (RP).  Methods:   We studied 171 men who underwent RP after standard PBx. The WGGG was calculated by summing each positive core using the formula: GGG + (GGG x %Ca/core). RP pathology was evaluated for extraprostatic extension (EPE), positive surgical margins (PSM), seminal vesicle invasion (SVI), and lymph node involvement (LNI), and patients were followed for BCR. We compared GGG vs. WGGG receiver operating characteristic curves for each outcome, and determined the predictive capability of GGG and WGGG to identify patients with BCR. Categorized WGGG groups were created based on risk of BCR using classification and regression tree analysis. We then sought to externally validate WGGG in a cohort of 389 patients in a separate institutional dataset.  Results:   In the development cohort, area under the curves (AUCs) for the WGGG vs. GGG were significantly higher for predicting EPE (0.784 vs. 0.690, P = 0.002), SVI (AUC 0.823 vs. 0.721, P = .014), LNI (AUC 0.862 vs. 0.823, P = 0.039), and PSM (AUC 0.638 vs. 0.575, P = 0.031. Analysis of the validation cohort showed similar findings for EPE (AUC 0.764 vs. 0.729, P = 0.13), SVI (AUC 0.819 vs. 0.749, P = 0.01), LNI (AUC 0.939 vs. 0.867, P = 0.02), and PSM (AUC 0.624 vs. 0.547, P = 0.04). Patients with WGGG >30 (high-risk group) demonstrated ∼50% failure at 2 years in both cohorts.  Conclusions:   The WGGG, by providing a metric reflecting the entirety of the PBx, is more informative than conventional single GGG alone in identifying adverse pathologic outcomes and risk of BCR following RP.

Therefore, treatment options are progressively based on quality of life. The objective of this research was to investigate magnitude of response shift (RS) in health-related quality of life (HRQOL) responses in men with clinically localized PCa using a generic questionnaire and a disease-specific questionnaire in an observational longitudinal patient registry study.  Patients and methods:   A cohort study was conducted using the Cancer of the Prostate Strategic Urologic Research Endeavor (CaPSURE) database. Patients were annually surveyed using the Medical Outcomes Study Questionnaire Short Form 36 (SF-36) and the UCLA Prostate Cancer Index (PCI) HRQOL measures. A total of 3161 active patients were eligible for a one-off supplemental study asking retrospective HRQOL scores (then-test). We calculated RS, observed change, and RS adjusted change. Statistical difference was determined by t test.  Results:   Patients consistently reported higher recalled pretreatment HRQOL compared to baseline scores for SF-36 and PCI, confirming the existence of a RS (P < .05). On average, PCI demonstrated larger RS by a factor of 2 than SF-36. More specific, RS was greater especially in SF-36 physical domains compared to mental health items.

Conclusion:   RS occurrence was measured in both the disease-specific questionnaire and the generic HRQOL questionnaire, demonstrating continued low health and symptom scores after RS adjustment. Therefore, health professionals should adjust for this phenomenon when assessing patient's HRQOL treatment responses, and clinicians should address their continued sexual and urinary functional loss.""","""['Renske M T Ten Ham', 'Jeanette M Broering', 'Matthew R Cooperberg', 'Peter Carroll', 'Leslie S Wilson']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Clin Genitourin Cancer""","""['Long-term health-related quality of life after primary treatment for localized prostate cancer: results from the CaPSURE registry.', 'Impact of comorbidity on health-related quality of life in men undergoing radical prostatectomy: data from CaPSURE.', 'Longitudinal Changes in Health-related Quality of Life After 125I Low-dose-rate Brachytherapy for Localized Prostate Cancer.', 'The effect of androgen deprivation therapy on health-related quality of life in men with prostate cancer.', 'Patient-reported outcome (PRO) questionnaires for men who have radical surgery for prostate cancer: a conceptual review of existing instruments.', 'Postoperative Effect Observation and Clinical Study of Dahuang Zhechong Pills from Jingui Yaolue in Treating Patients with Early-to-Mid Prostate Cancer Undergoing Radical Resection.', 'Do patients suffering from chronic diseases retrospectively overestimate how healthy they were before they fell ill?']"""

However, there is still little research on immunotherapy in prostate cancer. We explored the relationship between immune cell infiltration and prostate cancer recurrence and tried to provide new ideas for the treatment of prostate cancer.  Methods:   Prostate cancer RNA-seq data and clinical information were downloaded from the TCGA database and GEO database. The infiltration of 24 immune cells in tissues was quantified by ssGSEA. Univariate Cox regression analysis was used to screen for immune cell types associated with tumor recurrence, weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) and LASSO were used to identify hub genes which regulate prognosis in patients through immune infiltration. Then, the nomogram was constructed based on the hub gene to predict the recurrence of prostate cancer, and the decision curve analysis (DCA) was used to compare the accuracy with the PSA and Gleason prediction models.  Result:   Analysis showed that Th2 cells and Tcm related to prostate cancer recurrence after radical prostatectomy, and they are independent protective factors for recurrence. Through WGCNA and Lasso, we identified that NDUFA13, UQCR11, and USP34 involved in the infiltration of Th2 cells and Tcm in tumor tissues, and the expression of genes is related to the recurrence of patients. Based on the above findings, we constructed a clinical prediction model and mapped a nomogram, which has better sensitivity and specificity for prostate cancer recurrence prediction, and performed better in comparison with PSA and Gleason's predictions.  Conclusion:   The immune cells Th2 cells and Tcm are associated with recurrence of PCa. Moreover, the genes NDUFA13, UQCR11, and USP34 may affect the recurrence of PCa by affecting the infiltration of Th2 cells and Tcm. Moreover, nomogram can make prediction effectively.""","""['Xin Rui', 'Siliang Shao', 'Li Wang', 'Jiangyong Leng']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""BMC Cancer""","""['The establishment of immune infiltration based novel recurrence predicting nomogram in prostate cancer.', 'Genetic predisposition to early recurrence in clinically localized prostate cancer.', 'Exploration of the Tumor Mutational Burden as a Prognostic Biomarker and Related Hub Gene Identification in Prostate Cancer.', 'A post-radical-prostatectomy nomogram incorporating new pathological variables and interaction terms for improved prognosis.', 'Optimum Tools for Predicting Clinical Outcomes in Prostate Cancer Patients Undergoing Radical Prostatectomy: A Systematic Review of Prognostic Accuracy and Validity.', 'Comprehensive analysis the diagnosis, malignant progression and immune infiltrate of ANXA6 in prostate cancer.', 'A new prognostic nomogram in patients with mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma: a multicenter retrospective study.', 'Ubiquitin specific peptidases and prostate cancer.', 'Correlation analysis between immune-related genes and cell infiltration revealed prostate cancer immunotherapy biomarkers linked to T cells gamma delta.', 'Identification of m6A-related lncRNAs for thyroid cancer recurrence.']"""

However, how this functional multiplicity relates to syntenin-1 distribution in different endosome compartments or other intracellular locations and its underlying involvement in cancer pathogenesis have yet to be fully defined. To help facilitate the investigation of syntenin-1 biology, we developed two specific monoclonal antibodies (Synt-2C6 and Synt-3A11) to spatially distinct linear sequence epitopes on syntenin-1, which were each designed to be unique at the six-amino acid level. These antibodies produced very different intracellular staining patterns, with Synt-2C6 detecting endosomes and Synt-3A11 producing a fibrillar staining pattern suggesting a cytoskeletal localisation. Treatment of cells with Nocodazole altered the intracellular localisation of Synt-3A11, which was consistent with the syntenin-1 protein interacting with microtubules. In prostate tissue biopsies, Synt-3A11 defined atrophy and early-stage prostate cancer, whereas Synt-2C6 only showed minimal interaction with atrophic tissue.

In our present work, we have studied the capability of chips to detect nanowire biosensors when they are either freshly prepared or have been stored for either one or two years in a clean room. Potential to detect DNA oligonucleotides (oDNAs)-synthetic analogues of microRNAs (miRNAs) 198 and 429 that are associated with the development of prostate cancer (PCa)-in buffer solution was demonstrated using a nanowire biosensor based on silicon-on-insulator structures (SOI-NW biosensor). To provide biospecific detection, nanowire surfaces were sensitized with oligonucleotide probes (oDNA probes) complimentary to the known sequences of miRNA 183 and 484. In this study it is demonstrated that freshly prepared SOI-NW biosensor chips with n-type conductance and immobilized oDNA probes exhibit responses to the addition of complimentary oDNAs in buffer, leading to decreases in chips' conductance at a concentration of 3.3 × 10-16 M. The influence of storage time on the characteristics of SOI-NW biosensor chips is also studied herein. It is shown that a two-year storage of the chips leads to significant changes in their characteristics, resulting in ""inverse"" sensitivity toward negatively charged oDNA probes (i.e., through an increase in chips' conductance). It is concluded that the surface layer makes the main contribution to conductance of the biosensor chip. Our results indicate that the detection of target nucleic acid molecules can be carried out with high sensitivity using sensor chips after long-term storage, but that changes in their surface properties, which lead to inversed detection signals, must be taken into account. Examples of the applications of such chips for the detection of cancer-associated microRNAs in plasma samples of patients with diagnosed prostate cancer are given.

In this context, alternative strategies using biotechnologies, such as marine peptides, have been developed based on their promise of effectivity associated with a low toxicity for healthy cells. The purpose of the present paper is to investigate the active mechanism of two peptides that were isolated from the epigonal tissue of the lesser spotted dogfish Scyliorhinus canicula L., identified NFDTDEQALEDVFSKYG (K092A) and EAPPEAAEEDEW (K092B) on the in vitro growth inhibition of ZR-75-1 mammary carcinoma cells and MDA-Pca-2b prostate cancer cells.

All six patients were at a high risk of relapse and were likely to have a minimal residual disease following conventional therapy: biochemical recurrence (BCR) following radical prostatectomy (RP) (two prostate cancers patients), removal of distant metastases (one colorectal and one breast cancer), and complete response (CR) of distant metastases to conventional therapy (one breast cancer and one esophageal-gastric junction cancer). Four of the patients, two after RP and BCR, one after removal of a single pulmonary metastasis from breast cancer, and one after CR to chemotherapy of peritoneal metastases and ascites from an esophageal-gastric junction primary cancer, regularly received cycles of a new drug schedule with the aim of inhibiting immune suppression (IT). In these four patients, preliminary laboratory tests of peripheral blood suggested an interleukin (IL)-2/IL-12 mediated stimulation of cellular immune response with a concomitant decrease in vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) immune suppression. The fifth case was a breast cancer patient with distant metastases in CR, while receiving beta-interferon and interleukin-2 in addition to conventional hormone therapy. To date, all five patients are alive and doing well and they have been unexpectedly disease-free for 201 and 78 months following BCR, 28 months following the removal of a single pulmonary metastases, 32 months following CR to chemotherapy of peritoneal metastases and ascites, and 140 months following diagnosis of multiple bone metastases, respectively. The sixth patient, who had colorectal cancer and multiple synchronous liver metastases and underwent nine surgical interventions for metastatic disease, although not disease-free, is doing well 98 months after primary surgery. Our six cases reports can be interpreted with the hypothesis that immune manipulation and/or a concomitant low tumor burden favored their clinical outcome.""","""['Andrea Nicolini', 'Paola Ferrari', 'Riccardo Morganti', 'Angelo Carpi']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Int J Mol Sci""","""['Overview of resistance to systemic therapy in patients with breast cancer.', 'More advantages in detecting bone and soft tissue metastases from prostate cancer using 18F-PSMA PET/CT.', 'Phase II trial of celecoxib in prostate-specific antigen recurrent prostate cancer after definitive radiation therapy or radical prostatectomy.', 'Neoadjuvant irinotecan, cisplatin, and concurrent radiation therapy with celecoxib for patients with locally advanced esophageal cancer.', 'On the development of models in mice of advanced visceral metastatic disease for anti-cancer drug testing.', 'Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors and Other Immune Therapies in Breast Cancer: A New Paradigm for Prolonged Adjuvant Immunotherapy.']"""

The beams are ranked based on this metric and are accordingly chosen for IMRT optimization. We have used the Pinnacle TPS (Philips Medical System V 16.2) for performing the IMRT optimization. In order to validate our approach, we have applied it in four clinical cases: Head and Neck, Lung, Abdomen and Prostate. Basically, for all clinical cases, two set of plans were created with same clinical objectives, namely Equal angle plan (EA Plan) and Suitable angle Plan (SA Plan). In the EA plans, the beam angles were placed in an equiangular manner starting from the gantry angle of 0°. In the corresponding SA plans, the beam angles were decided using the guidance provided by the algorithm. The reduction in OAR mean dose and max dose obtained in SA plans is about 3 to 16% and 3 to 15% respectively depending upon the treatment site while obtaining equal target coverage as compared to their EA counterparts. It takes approximately 15-25 min to find the optimal beam angles. The results obtained from the clinical cases indicate that the plan quality is considerably improved when the beam angles are optimized using the proposed method.""","""['Natarajan Ramar', 'S R Meher', 'Vaitheeswaran Ranganathan', 'Bojarajan Perumal', 'Prashant Kumar', 'Gipson Joe Anto', 'S Harikrishna Etti']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Phys Med""","""['Algorithm and performance of a clinical IMRT beam-angle optimization system.', 'A simple geometric algorithm to predict optimal starting gantry angles using equiangular-spaced beams for intensity modulated radiation therapy of prostate cancer.', 'An experimental investigation on the effect of beam angle optimization on the reduction of beam numbers in IMRT of head and neck tumors.', 'Simultaneous beam geometry and intensity map optimization in intensity-modulated radiation therapy.', 'An algorithm for fast beam angle selection in intensity modulated radiotherapy.', 'A reinforcement learning application of a guided Monte Carlo Tree Search algorithm for beam orientation selection in radiation therapy.', 'A Novel Method for Improving VMAT Plan Quality and Deliverability.']"""

To improve the model's goodness-of-fit, an intermediate model was generated using the dose-volume histograms of best-spared organs-at-risk (OARs) of the initial model. Using the intermediate model and manual tweaking, all 48 cases were re-planned. The final model, trained using these re-plans, was validated on 50 additional patients.

However, plan complexity and deliverability have not been addressed previously for treatment plans guided by an established in-house KBP system. The purpose of this work was to assess dosimetric, mechanical, and delivery properties of plans designed with a common KBP method for prostate cases treated via volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT).  Methods:   Thirty-one prostate patients previously treated with VMAT were replanned with an in-house KBP method based on the overlap volume histogram. VMAT plan complexities of the KBP plans and the reference clinical plans were quantified via monitor units, modulation complexity scores, the edge metric, and average leaf motion per degree of gantry rotation. Each set of plans was delivered to the same diode array and agreement between computed and measured dose distributions was evaluated using the gamma index. Varying percent dose-difference (1-3%) and distance-to-agreement (1 mm to 3 mm) thresholds were assessed for gamma analyses.  Results:   Knowledge-based planning (KBP) plans achieved average reductions of 6.4 Gy (P < 0.001) and 8.2 Gy (P < 0.001) in mean bladder and rectum dose compared to reference plans, while maintaining clinically acceptable target dose. However, KBP plans were significantly more complex than reference plans in each evaluated metric (P < 0.001). KBP plans also showed significant reductions (P < 0.05) in gamma passing rates at each evaluated criterion compared to reference plans.

Testosterone and other clinical factors at the start of docetaxel treatment were evaluated with respect to overall survival and progression-free survival.  Results:   Of the 164 patients, 69 had high-volume tumors. The median prostatic-specific antigen was 27.0 ng/mL. The median testosterone was 13.0 ng/dL. The rates of bone and visceral metastases were 80.1% and 8.8%, respectively. For progression-free survival, testosterone ≥13 ng/dL was an independent prognostic factor only on univariate analysis (hazard ratio, 1.81; P = .0108). For overall survival, testosterone ≥ 1.3 ng/dL (hazard ratio, 3.37; P < .0001), high volume (hazard ratio, 3.06; P = .0009), and prostate-specific antigen ≥ 27.0 ng/mL (hazard ratio, 2.75; P = .0013) were independent prognostic factors on multivariate analysis.

There are conflicting reports about whether or not heterozygous BLM carriers are at a higher risk of various cancers. Without BLM protein functionality, there is evidence of increased sister chromatid exchange and chromosomal instability.  Methods:   Metastatic prostate cancer patients (N = 796) underwent germline genetic testing as part of routine care at three academic centers. Patients with heterozygous BLM mutations were identified. Tumor tissue was analyzed for somatic alterations in those patients who had a germline pathogenic mutation. Control data using a population sample were extracted from the Genome Aggregation Database.  Results:   Heterozygous BLM germline mutations in 5 of 796 patients (prevalence, 0.63%). All mutations were loss-of-function truncating alterations. None of the mutations were BLMAsh . The control population (gnomAD) frequency of pathogenic or likely pathogenic BLM mutations was 0.18% (212 of 116 653). The relative risk (RR) of BLM mutations in metastatic prostate cancer patients was 3.4 (95% CI, 1.42-8.33; P < .0062) compared to gnomAD controls. Tumor DNA sequencing in the BLM carriers showed no evidence of somatic BLM mutations. Interestingly, 3 of 5 BLM germline carriers had bi-allelic BRCA2 inactivation evident on tumor sequencing. One patient had both germline and somatic mutations in BRCA2. Excluding the patient with the germline BRCA2 mutation (BLM prevalence, 4 of 796: 0.50%) still yielded a statistically significant finding vs the gnomAD controls (RR, 2.8; 95% CI, 1.02-7.39; P < .04).  Conclusion:   Truncating BLM germline mutations occur at a higher frequency in patients with advanced prostate cancer as compared to control populations. Though no biallelic loss of BLM was no noted in cancers, a surprising number of the BLM germline heterozygotes had pathogenic BRCA2 mutations in their tumor.""","""['Elisa M Ledet', 'Emmanuel S Antonarakis', 'William B Isaacs', 'Tamara L Lotan', 'Colin Pritchard', 'A Oliver Sartor']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['A common nonsense mutation of the BLM gene and prostate cancer risk and survival.', 'Heterozygous germline BLM mutations increase susceptibility to asbestos and mesothelioma.', 'Deleterious Germline BLM Mutations and the Risk for Early-onset Colorectal Cancer.', 'Bringing Prostate Cancer Germline Genetics into Clinical Practice.', 'Implications of High Rates of Metastatic Prostate Cancer in BRCA2 Mutation Carriers.', 'BLM helicase overexpressed in human gliomas contributes to diverse responses of human glioma cells to chemotherapy.', 'N6‑methyladenosine‑induced long non‑coding RNA PVT1 regulates the miR‑27b‑3p/BLM axis to promote prostate cancer progression.', 'Mutational landscape of homologous recombination-related genes in small-cell lung cancer.', 'RecQ Helicase Somatic Alterations in Cancer.', 'BLM interaction with EZH2 regulates MDM2 expression and is a poor prognostic biomarker for prostate cancer.']"""

However, in a significant number of cases, the disease progresses to advanced, castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), which has limited therapeutic options and is often aggressive. Distant metastasis is mostly observed at this stage of the aggressive disease. CRPC is treated by a second generation of AR pathway inhibitors that improve survival initially, followed by the emergence of therapy resistance. Neuroendocrine prostate cancer (NEPC) is a rare variant of prostate cancer (PCa) that often develops as a result of therapy resistance via a transdifferentiation process known as neuroendocrine differentiation (NED), wherein PCa cells undergo a lineage switch from adenocarcinomas and show increased expression of neuroendocrine (NE) lineage markers. In addition to the genomic alterations that drive the progression and transdifferentiation to NEPC, epigenetic factors and microenvironmental cues are considered essential players in driving disease progression. This manuscript provides a detailed protocol to identify the epigenetic drivers (i.e., small non-coding RNAs) that are associated with advanced PCa. Using purified microRNAs from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) metastatic tissues and corresponding serum-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs), the protocol describes how to prepare libraries with appropriate quality control for sequencing microRNAs from these sample sources. Isolating RNA from both FFPE and EVs is often challenging because most of it is either degraded or is limited in quantity. This protocol will elaborate on different methods to optimize the RNA inputs and cDNA libraries to yield most specific reads and high-quality data upon sequencing.""","""['Divya Bhagirath', 'Rajvir Dahiya', 'Shahana Majid', 'Z Laura Tabatabai', 'Sharanjot Saini']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""J Vis Exp""","""['Novel, non-invasive markers for detecting therapy induced neuroendocrine differentiation in castration-resistant prostate cancer patients.', 'MicroRNA determinants of neuroendocrine differentiation in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Molecular model for neuroendocrine prostate cancer progression.', 'Role of MicroRNAs in Neuroendocrine Prostate Cancer.', 'c-MYC drives histone demethylase PHF8 during neuroendocrine differentiation and in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Novel, non-invasive markers for detecting therapy induced neuroendocrine differentiation in castration-resistant prostate cancer patients.', 'MicroRNA-4287 is a novel tumor suppressor microRNA controlling epithelial-to mesenchymal transition in prostate cancer.', 'LncRNA CCDC26 Interacts with CELF2 Protein to Enhance Myeloid Leukemia Cell Proliferation and Invasion via the circRNA_ANKIB1/miR-195-5p/PRR11 Axis.']"""

In vivo lineage tracing has been utilized to define the differentiation capacity of mouse prostate basal and luminal cells during development, tissue-regeneration and transformation. However, evaluating cell-intrinsic and extrinsic regulators of prostate epithelial differentiation capacity using a lineage tracing approach often requires extensive breeding and can be cost-prohibitive. In the prostate organoid assay, basal and luminal cells generate prostatic epithelium ex vivo. Importantly, primary epithelial cells can be isolated from mice of any genetic background or mice treated with any number of small molecules prior to, or after, plating into three-dimensional (3D) culture. Sufficient material for evaluation of differentiation capacity is generated after 7-10 days. Collection of basal-derived and luminal-derived organoids for (1) protein analysis by Western blot and (2) immunohistochemical analysis of intact organoids by whole-mount confocal microscopy enables researchers to evaluate the ex vivo differentiation capacity of prostate epithelial cells.

The total amount of lifetime alcohol consumption (drink-years) was recalled for each patient by multiplication of the daily amount of standardized alcohol use (drinks per day) and the duration of drinking (years).

Lifetime abstainers served as the reference group.  Results:   Spline curves showed a dose-response association with overall cancer risk: the minimum risk was at 0 drink-years, and the OR at 10 drink-years was 1.05 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.04-1.06).

Methods:   We collected 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT images from 193 patients with metastatic PC at three medical centers. For proof-of-concept, we focused on the detection of pelvis bone and lymph node lesions. A deep neural network (triple-combining 2.5D U-Net) was developed for the automated characterization of these lesions. The proposed method simultaneously extracts features from axial, coronal, and sagittal planes, which mimics the workflow of physicians and reduces computational and memory requirements.  Results:   Among all the labeled lesions, the network achieved 99% precision, 99% recall, and an F1 score of 99% on bone lesion detection and 94%, precision 89% recall, and an F1 score of 92% on lymph node lesion detection. The segmentation accuracy is lower than the detection. The performance of the network was correlated with the amount of training data.  Conclusion:   We developed a deep neural network to characterize automatically the PC lesions on 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT. The preliminary test within the pelvic area confirms the potential of deep learning methods. Increasing the amount of training data should further enhance the performance of the proposed method and may ultimately allow whole-body assessments.""","""['Yu Zhao', 'Andrei Gafita', 'Bernd Vollnberg', 'Giles Tetteh', 'Fabian Haupt', 'Ali Afshar-Oromieh', 'Bjoern Menze', 'Matthias Eiber', 'Axel Rominger', 'Kuangyu Shi']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Eur J Nucl Med Mol Imaging""","""['Deep Neural Network for Automatic Characterization of Lesions on 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT Images.', 'More advantages in detecting bone and soft tissue metastases from prostate cancer using 18F-PSMA PET/CT.', 'Automatic segmentation of prostate cancer metastases in PSMA PET/CT images using deep neural networks with weighted batch-wise dice loss.', 'Whole-Body Integrated 68GaPSMA-11-PET/MR Imaging in Patients with Recurrent Prostate Cancer: Comparison with Whole-Body PET/CT as the Standard of Reference.', '68Ga-PSMA-PET/CT Has a Role in Detecting Prostate Cancer Lesions in Patients with Recurrent Disease.', 'Prognostic utility of RECIP 1.0 with manual and AI-based segmentations in biochemically recurrent prostate cancer from 68GaGa-PSMA-11 PET images.', 'Multiparametric dynamic whole-body PSMA PET/CT using 68GaGa-PSMA-11 and 18FPSMA-1007.', 'Modeling contrast-to-noise ratio from list mode reconstructions of 68Ga DOTATATE PET/CT: predicting detectability of hepatic metastases in shorter acquisition PET reconstructions.', 'Mask R-CNN assisted 2.5D object detection pipeline of 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT-positive metastatic pelvic lymph node after radical prostatectomy from solely CT imaging.', 'Fully automatic prognostic biomarker extraction from metastatic prostate lesion segmentations in whole-body 68GaGa-PSMA-11 PET/CT images.']"""

Patients and methods:   Case report forms of the randomized controlled trial were analyzed to specify the grade of postoperative ejaculatory dysfunction 3 months postoperatively. In addition, study participants with assessable ejaculation were asked to complete the four-item Male Sexual Health Questionnaire-Ejaculation Dysfunction Short Form (MSHQ-EjD) referring to their ejaculatory function at present, as well as before treatment and 3 months after. Potential explanations for ejaculatory disorders after PAE were derived from histological examination of five radical prostatectomy specimens of patients that underwent PAE 6 weeks before radical prostatectomy within a proof-of-concept trial at the study site, St. Gallen Cantonal Hospital. An experienced uropathologist systematically examined the whole-gland embedded tissue with focus on structures that are involved into ejaculation.  Results:   While patients after TURP predominantly suffered from anejaculation (52%), diminished ejaculation was found more often after PAE (40%). Significantly higher MSHQ-EjD scores were found 3 months after PAE and at a median follow-up of 31 months. Histological examination showed marked changes of structures involved into ejaculation (e.g., prostatic glands, seminal vesicles, ejaculatory ducts) after PAE.

Most previous DC validation studies have a limited number of expert observers for comparison and/or use a validation dataset related to the training dataset. We determine if DC models are comparable to Radiation Oncologist (RO) inter-observer variability on an independent dataset.  Methods:   Expert contours (EC) were created by multiple ROs for central nervous system (CNS), head and neck (H&N), and prostate radiotherapy (RT) OARs and CTVs. DCs were generated using deep learning-based auto-segmentation software trained by a single RO on publicly available data. Contours were compared using Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) and 95% Hausdorff distance (HD).  Results:   Sixty planning CT scans had 2-4 ECs, for a total of 60 CNS, 53 H&N, and 50 prostate RT contour sets. The mean DC and EC contouring times were 0.4 vs 7.7 min for CNS, 0.6 vs 26.6 min for H&N, and 0.4 vs 21.3 min for prostate RT contours. There were minimal differences in DSC and 95% HD involving DCs for OAR comparisons, but more noticeable differences for CTV comparisons.  Conclusions:   The accuracy of DCs trained by a single RO is comparable to expert inter-observer variability for the RT planning contours in this study.

We demonstrate the power of this framework using 4 publicly available prostate routines.  Methods and materials:   Four publicly available prostate routines (CCMB, Miami, UCSD, WUSTL) were automatically applied across a 25-patient cohort using Eclipse scripting and a PTV prescription of V81 Gy = 95%. The institutions' routines differed in contouring guidelines for planning target volume (PTV) and organs at risk, beam arrangements, and optimization parameters. Model-estimated dose-volume histograms (DVHs) and deliverable postoptimization DVHs were extracted from plans to calculate average DVHs for each routine. Each routine's average calculated DVH was subtracted from the average DVH for all plans and from the model's average predicted DVH for comparison. DVH metrics for PTV (DMAX, D1%, D99%, DMIN), Rectum (DMAX, V70, V60, V40), Bladder (V75, V40), Femur (DMAX), and PenileBulb (DMEAN) were compared with the average using 2-sided paired t tests (Bonferroni-corrected P < .05). To control for contouring effects, the full analysis was conducted for 2 PTV margin schemas: 5 mm uniform and 3 mm or 7 mm posterior/else.  Results:   Calculated plans generally aligned with their routine's DVH estimations, except CCMB organ-at-risk Dmaxes. Dosimetric parameter differences were not significant, with the exception of PTV DMAX (Miami = 111.1% [P < .001]), PTV D99% (Miami = 97.4% [P = .05]; UCSD = 97.4% [P = .03]; CCMB = 98.5% [P = .001]), Rectum V40 (Miami = 19.1% [P < .001]; UCSD = 22.7% [P = .003]; CCMB = 53.5% [P < .001]), and Femur DMAX (WUSTL = 48.6% [P = .001.]; CCMB = 37.9% [P < .001]). Overall, UCSD and Miami had lower rectum doses, and CCMB and WUSTL had higher PTV homogeneity. Conclusions were unchanged with different PTV margin schemas.  Conclusions:   Using publicly available knowledge-based planning routines spares clinicians substantial effort in developing new models. Our results allow clinicians to select the prostate routine that matches their clinical priorities, and our methodology sets the precedent for comparing routines for different treatment sites.""","""['Xenia Ray', 'Robert Kaderka', 'Sebastian Hild', 'Mariel Cornell', 'Kevin L Moore']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Pract Radiat Oncol""","""['Stereotactic IMRT for prostate cancer: dosimetric impact of multileaf collimator leaf width in the treatment of prostate cancer with IMRT.', 'Highly Efficient Training, Refinement, and Validation of a Knowledge-based Planning Quality-Control System for Radiation Therapy Clinical Trials.', 'Fitting tumor control probability models to biopsy outcome after three-dimensional conformal radiation therapy of prostate cancer: pitfalls in deducing radiobiologic parameters for tumors from clinical data.', 'Predicting dose-volume histograms for organs-at-risk in IMRT planning.', 'Automated Closed- and Open-Loop Validation of Knowledge-Based Planning Routines Across Multiple Disease Sites.', 'Prospects for daily online adaptive radiotherapy via ethos for prostate cancer patients without nodal involvement using unedited CBCT auto-segmentation.', 'Effect of treatment planning system parameters on beam modulation complexity for treatment plans with single-layer multi-leaf collimator and dual-layer stacked multi-leaf collimator.']"""

There are obvious problems with the use of the IIEF in the assessment of an individual patient, such as for men who use injections and men who do not engage in intercourse.  Aim:   The aim of the current study is to redesign the erectile function domain of the IIEF (IIEF6) to more accurately assess the individual patient.  Methods:   In an observational study of men undergoing treatment for prostate cancer at a tertiary care institution, including 24,732 questionnaires completed by 6,780 individuals, IIEF6 scores were compared for patients using and not using erectile aids. Men not engaging in sexual intercourse were asked to describe the reason.  Main outcome measure:   The main outcome we were seeking was the IIEF6 scores.  Results:   Mean scores before erectile aids items were added was 17.7 compared with predicted scores of 18.3 vs 16.7 if patients reported their function with vs without the use of aids. No intercourse was reported for 35% of surveys. Reasons given were lack of ability or confidence in 53%, lack of willing and available partner in 28%, ""other"" in 17% (including respondent's or partner's health issues, low libido, preference for nonpenetrative sex or for sex with men). Doubling the sum of the 3 nonintercourse IIEF6 questions had excellent properties (difference of 0.06, limits of agreement -3.10 to 3.22).  Clinical implications:   Erectile function instruments must include items about erectile aids. Men who report that they have not attempted intercourse should not be assumed to have erectile dysfunction, but should be asked the reason why. For men who report lack of opportunity or preference for intercourse, the score of the 3 nonintercourse IIEF6 questions should be doubled.  Strengths & limitations:   This is a large study of patients in a real-world setting. Although the study only includes radical prostatectomy patients, and although the study cohort is not fully representative of the US prostate cancer population as a whole, these issues would not affect the key findings.  Conclusion:   The IIEF6 can be redesigned to better assess the individual patient. Vickers AJ, Tin AL, Singh K, et al.

Patients and methods:   We performed a retrospective 2-center study on 660 consecutive patients receiving transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsy-biopsy from June 2016 to October 2018. Pathologic and immunohistochemical characteristics were collected. PPF measurements including PPF area (PPFA) and PPFA to prostate area (PA) ratio (PPFA/PA) were assessed by preoperative staging magnetic resonance imaging. Clinical variables were correlated with Gleason score by using Spearman (ρ) correlation coefficients. Multivariable analysis was performed to identify independent predictors of PCa. The diagnostic performance was estimated using ROC curves.  Results:   The Gleason score was significantly correlated with age (ρ = 0.114, P = 0.035), prostate-specific antigen (PSA) (ρ = 0.482, P < 0.001), PIRADS scoring (ρ = 0.403, P < 0.001) and PPFA/PA (ρ = 0.238, P < 0.001). Multivariate analysis revealed that PPFA/PA, age, digital rectal examination, family history of PCa, PSA, and PIRADS scoring were independently predictive of PCa. The ROC AUC to detect PCa or clinically significant PCa (CS-PCa; Gleason Score 3 + 4 or greater) improved with the addition of PPFA/PA (PCa: 0.93 vs. 0.89; CS-PCa: 0.92 vs. 0.90).  Conclusion:   PPFA/PA is an independent predictor for PCa along with age, digital rectal examination, family history of PCa, PSA, and PIRADS scoring.

Methods and materials:   Patients undergoing MRI-assisted radiosurgery (MARS), whereby MRI is used for preoperative planning and postimplant dosimetry, were reviewed from May 2016 to September 2018. Planned activity (U) was fitted by MR-prostate volume (cc) via simple linear regression. Resulting monotherapy nomograms were compared with institutional nomograms from an ultrasound-planned cohort. Dosimetric coverage and external urinary sphincter (EUS) dose were also assessed for MR-planned patients.  Results:   We identified 183 patients treated with MARS: 146 patients received palladium-103 (103Pd; 102 monotherapy and 44 boost), and 37 received iodine-125 (125I) monotherapy. Median prostate volume was 28 cc (interquartile range: 22-35).

Oral melanocytic neoplasms are often malignant and associated with poor prognosis. There are no universally accepted prognostic markers for canine oral melanoma. Galectin (Gal)-3 is a prognostic marker for human neoplasms such as thyroid, gastric, colorectal and prostate cancers. The protein is related to processes that favour cancer progression, such as angiogenesis, proliferation and apoptosis. The aim of the present study was to characterize the immunohistochemical expression of Gal-3 in canine oral melanomas and to compare it with post-surgical survival, the expression of apoptosis-related proteins and other known prognostic tools. Twenty-seven samples of canine oral melanomas were evaluated for Gal-3, B-cell lymphoma (BCL) 2, caspase (CASP) 3 and Ki67 expression, mitotic index and degree of nuclear atypia. Gal-3 cytoplasmic positivity was correlated positively, while nuclear positivity was correlated negatively, with survival. The intensity of BCL2 labelling was also correlated positively with Gal-3 cytoplasmic positivity. Higher nuclear atypia was observed in dogs with melanoma that died due to the tumour, as well as in dogs that survived for <1 year after surgery. We have confirmed the importance of nuclear atypia for MMs and suggest that Gal-3 is a valuable prognostic indicator for this neoplasm. More in-depth studies are needed to unveil Gal-3 functions in canine MMs using larger sample sizes.""","""['T H M Vargas', 'L H Pulz', 'D G Ferro', 'R A Sobral', 'M A F A Venturini', 'H L Corrêa', 'R F Strefezzi']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""J Comp Pathol""","""['Cyclooxygenase-2 expression is associated with infiltration of inflammatory cells in oral and skin canine melanomas.', 'Immunohistochemical characterization and evaluation of prognostic factors in canine oral melanomas with osteocartilaginous differentiation.', 'Galectin-3 immunolabelling correlates with BCL2 expression in canine cutaneous mast cell tumours.', 'Retrospective study of 338 canine oral melanomas with clinical, histologic, and immunohistochemical review of 129 cases.', 'Canine Melanomas as Models for Human Melanomas: Clinical, Histological, and Genetic Comparison.', 'Diagnosis and histopathologic prognostication of canine melanocytic neoplasms: A consensus of the Oncology-Pathology Working Group.', 'Diagnosis and Prognosis of Canine Melanocytic Neoplasms.', 'Circulating Galectin-3 Evaluation in Dogs With Cardiac and Non-cardiac Diseases.']"""

However, it is unclear whether MSI affects the entire tumor mass or is distributed heterogeneously, the latter potentially impairing treatment efficiency.  Methods:   To identify prostate cancers with MSI, 316 advanced prostate cancers were analyzed by immunohistochemistry (IHC) for the mismatch repair (MMR) proteins MLH1, PMS2, MSH2, and MSH6 on a TMA format.  Results:   Out of 200 interpretable cancers, IHC findings were consistent with MSI in 10 tumors. In 9 of these 10 cancers, tissue blocks were available for subsequent large section IHC, confirming MSI in 6 cases, each with combined protein loss of MSH2 and MSH6. One additional tumor with unequivocal loss of MLH1 and PMS2 on the TMA, for which further analyses could not be carried out due to lack of tissue, was also considered to exhibit MSI. In total, 7 of 200 interpretable advanced prostate cancers were found to exhibit MMR deficiency/MSI (3.5%). Subsequent analysis of all available cancer-containing archived tissue blocks (n=114) revealed consistent and homogeneous MMR protein loss in each case. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based analysis using the ""Bethesda panel"" could be executed in 6 MMR deficient tumors of which 4 were MSI-high and 2 were MSI-low.  Conclusions:   The absence of intratumoral heterogeneity for the MMR status suggests that MSI occurs early in prostate cancer.

Given the utility of plasma cell-free DNA (cfDNA) biomarkers, the development of urinary cfDNA biomarkers may improve the diagnostic sensitivity.  Methods:   We assessed copy number alterations (CNAs) by shallow genome-wide sequencing of urinary cfDNA in 95 cancer-free individuals and 65 patients with UC, 58 with kidney cancer, and 45 with prostate cancer. We used a support vector machine to develop a diagnostic classifier based on CNA profiles to detect UC (UCdetector). The model was further validated in an independent cohort (52 patients). Genome sequencing data of tumor specimens from 90 upper tract urothelial cancers (UTUCs) and CNA data for 410 urothelial carcinomas of bladder (UCBs) from The Cancer Genome Atlas were used to validate the classifier. Genome sequencing data for urine sediment from 32 patients with UC were compared with cfDNA. To monitor the treatment efficacy, we collected cfDNA from 7 posttreatment patients.  Results:   Urinary cfDNA was a more sensitive alternative to urinary sediment. The UCdetector could detect UC at a median clinical sensitivity of 86.5% and specificity of 94.7%. UCdetector performed well in an independent validation data set. Notably, the CNA features selected by UCdetector were specific markers for both UTUC and UCB. Moreover, CNA changes in cfDNA were consistent with the treatment effects. Meanwhile, the same strategy could localize genitourinary cancers to tissue of origin in 70.1% of patients.

However, little is known about the most informative ICE for patients receiving salvage radiation therapy (sRT) after radical prostatectomy. To investigate the most informative ICE for patients receiving sRT, we used a multi-institutional database encompassing patients treated at eight tertiary centers. Overall, 1301 men with node-negative disease who had not received any form of androgen deprivation therapy were identified. Associations of biochemical (BCR) and clinical recurrence (CR) within 1, 3, 5, and 7yr after surgery with the risk of overall mortality were evaluated using multivariable Cox regression analyses fitted at the landmark points of 1, 3, 5, and 7yr after sRT. The discriminative ability of each model for predicting overall survival (OS) was assessed using Harrell's c index. Median follow-up for survivors was 5.6yr (interquartile range 2.0-8.8). On multivariable analysis, progression to CR within 3yr from sRT (hazard ratio 4.19, 95% confidence interval 1.44-11.2; p= 0.008) was the most informative ICE for predicting OS (c index 0.78) compared to CR within 1, 5, and 7yr (c index 0.72, 0.75, and 0.71). In conclusion, progression to CR within 3yr after sRT, irrespective of the time of surgery, was the most informative ICE for prediction of OS. Our study is hypothesis-generating. If these results are confirmed in future prospective studies and surrogacy is met, this information could be applied for study design and could potentially expedite earlier release of results from ongoing randomized controlled trials. PATIENT SUMMARY: Clinical recurrence of prostate cancer within 3yr after salvage radiation therapy, irrespective of the time of radical prostatectomy, represents the most informative intermediate clinical endpoint for the prediction of overall survival.

The agents for the sequential therapy included new androgen receptor-targeted agents (ART: abiraterone acetate or enzalutamide), docetaxel, and/or cabazitaxel. We evaluated the treatment sequence for mCRPC and the effect of sequence patterns on overall survival.  Results:   The median age was 71 years.

In this work, poly(methyl methacrylate) films have been processed applying different oxygen plasma conditions to fabricate surfaces with structure height ranging from 22 to more than 2000 nm. The surfaces were then evaluated with respect to adhesion and proliferation of both normal and cancer human cells. In particular, normal skin and lung fibroblasts, and four different cancer cell lines, A431 (skin cancer), HT1080 (fibrosarcoma), A549 (lung cancer), and PC3 (prostate cancer), have been employed. It was found that adhesion and proliferation of cancer cells was favored when cultured onto the hierarchical micro/nanostructured surfaces as compared to untreated ones with the maximum values obtained for substrates treated at -100 V for 3 min. On the other hand, although the adhesion of normal fibroblasts was not influenced by the micro/nanostructured surfaces, their morphology and proliferation was significantly impaired, especially after 3-day culture on these surfaces. The reduced proliferation rate of adherent fibroblasts was linked to reduced focal points formation, as it was verified through vinculin staining, and not to apoptosis. The micro/nanostructured surfaces prepared with plasma treatment at -100 V for 3 min (hierarchical topography with mean height of ∼800 nm) were selected as substrates for normal and cancer cell co-culture experiments. It was found that 25-80 times enrichment of cancer over the normal cells was achieved on the nanostructured surfaces after 3-day culture, while it was 5-8 times lower on the untreated ones. It should be noticed that this is the first time such high enrichment ratios are achieved without implementing surfaces modified with binding molecules specific for cancer cells. Thus, the nanostructured surfaces hold a strong promise as culture substrates for separation and enrichment of cancer cells from mixtures with normal ones that should find application in cancer diagnostics.""","""['Anastasia Kanioura', 'Panagiota Petrou', 'Dimitris Kletsas', 'Angeliki Tserepi', 'Margarita Chatzichristidi', 'Evangelos Gogolides', 'Sotirios Kakabakos']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Colloids Surf B Biointerfaces""","""['Human gingival fibroblast functions are stimulated by oxidized nano-structured titanium surfaces.', 'Adhesion of fibroblasts on micro- and nanostructured surfaces prepared by chemical vapor deposition and pulsed laser treatment.', 'Adhesion and proliferation of fibroblasts on RF plasma-deposited nanostructured fluorocarbon coatings: evidence of FAK activation.', 'Nanotopography: cellular responses to nanostructured materials.', 'Bactericidal efficiency of micro- and nanostructured surfaces: a critical perspective.', 'Nanotechnology in emerging liquid biopsy applications.']"""

Li. show the anticancer and RNA expression regulating effects on prostate cancer cells""","""Paris forrestii is a unique plant found in Tibet and Yunnan, China, and total saponins from Paris forrestii (PCT3) contain anticancer steroid glycosides. RNA expression plays an important role in various biological processes. However, the cytotoxicity effects and mechanisms of PCT3 in relation to prostate cancer (PCa) cells have not yet been reported. In the present study, the antitumor activity of PCT3 on PCa cells was evaluated. PCT3 displayed potent anticancer effects toward PCa cells that were similar to the effects of pure saponins from P. forrestii, but PCT3 had less activity in suppressing the prostate epithelial cell line RWPE. Furthermore, using CCK-8 assays, Edu incorporation, colony formation assays, Annexin V/PI assays and western blotting, we found that treatment with 4 μg/mL PCT3 significantly decreased proliferation and induced apoptosis in PCa cells. Using wound healing and transwell assays, we demonstrated that treatment with 2 μg/mL PCT3 significantly suppressed the migration and invasion of PCa cells. To explore the molecular mechanisms behind the anticancer effect of PCT3, PCT3 (5 μg/mL) treated and untreated PCa cells (LNCAP and PC3 cell lines) were analyzed using transcriptomics. Taking the commonly differentially expressed genes (log2FC > 0.585) in both cell lines, 41 mRNAs and 5 lncRNAs were eventually identified. Bioinformatics analysis (GO and KEGG analyses) revealed that some genes involved in classical cell proliferation and apoptosis pathways were aberrantly expressed after PCT3 treatment of PCa cells. By using q-PCR, the expression levels of NEAT1, MALAT1, TIPIN, LYAR, IQGAP3, GINS2, and ZGRF1 were validated as consistent with microarray data, suggesting that these genes might participate in the PCT3 anticancer effect. The present study suggests that PCT3 exhibits an anticancer effect on PCa and reveals some crucial lncRNAs and mRNAs that are involved in the anticancer mechanisms of PCT3 on Pca.""","""['Chengxing Xia', 'Liu Chen', 'Wanghong Sun', 'Ruping Yan', 'Mengyuan Xia', 'Yuehu Wang', 'Delin Yang']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Biomed Pharmacother""","""['Mechanism of Paris Forrestii (Takht.)

Materials and methods:   12-month old Wistar rats were kept in control conditions (n = 12) or treated (n = 16) for 6 months with Silastic implants filled with testosterone (T) and estradiol (E2). After the experiment period (at 18 months of age), animals were euthanized and the prostate and other organs were harvested, dissected, weighed, and processed for morphological, ultrastructural and molecular analyses.  Key findings:   We demonstrated that male rats of Wistar strain nicely recapitulate the carcinogenesis process taking place in the aging prostate through the arising of benign, precancerous and malignant lesions, and above all yields a modest incidence of spontaneous PCa (~36%). Moreover, our results highlight that 100% incidence of PCa and precancerous lesions such as prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia and proliferative inflammatory atrophy were achieved in this rat strain after T + E2 treatment, without changing the broad spectrum of changes that naturally emerge in the prostate at advanced ages. Such enhancement of precancerous lesions and tumors was linked to a decreased expression of E-cadherin and β-catenin in parallel with an increase in Vimentin and N-cadherin, hallmark modifications of epithelial-mesenchymal transition.  Significance:   Our findings provide solid evidence that aged Wistar rats may be an excellent model for studies regarding human prostate biology and related disorders including cancer.""","""['Gabriel H Campolina-Silva', 'Hipácia Werneck-Gomes', 'Bruna T Maria', 'Maria C Barata', 'María J Torres', 'Héctor R Contreras', 'Germán A B Mahecha', 'Cleida A Oliveira']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Life Sci""","""['Histopathological evidence for an association of inflammation with ductal pin-like lesions but not with ductal adenocarcinoma in the prostate of the noble rat.', 'Hormonal and genotoxic estrogen-androgen carcinogenesis in the NBL rat prostate: A role for aromatase.', 'Reduced vitamin D receptor (VDR) expression and plasma vitamin D levels are associated with aging-related prostate lesions.', 'Preneoplastic prostate lesions: an opportunity for prostate cancer prevention.', 'A theoretical rationale on the histogenesis of premalignant lesions and early carcinoma of the prostate.', 'Lifelong exercise training promotes the remodelling of the immune system and prostate signalome in a rat model of prostate carcinogenesis.']"""

Only 1 phase 3 randomized clinical trial has demonstrated an overall survival (OS) benefit from an α-emitting RI, radium 223 (223Ra), vs standard of care. Yet no head-to-head comparison has been done between α-emitting and β-emitting RIs.  Objective:   To assess OS in men with bone metastases from CRPC treated with bone-targeted RIs and to compare the effects of α-emitting RIs with β-emitting RIs.  Data sources:   PubMed, Cochrane Library, ClinicalTrials.gov, and meeting proceedings between January 1993 and June 2013 were reviewed. Key terms included randomized trials, radioisotopes, radiopharmaceuticals, and prostate cancer. Data were collected, checked, and analyzed from February 2017 to October 2018.  Study selection:   Selected trials included patients with prostate cancer, recruited more than 50 patients from January 1993 to June 2013, compared RI use with no RI use (placebo, external radiotherapy, or chemotherapy), and were randomized. Patients were diagnosed with histologically proven prostate cancer and disease progression after both surgical or chemical castration and have evidence of bone metastasis. Nine randomized clinical trials were identified as eligible, but 3 were excluded for insufficient data.  Data extraction and synthesis:   Individual patient data were requested for each eligible trial, and all data were checked with a standard procedure. The log-rank test stratified by trial was used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs), and a similar fixed-effects (FE) model was used to estimate odds ratios (ORs). The between-trial heterogeneity of treatment effects was evaluated by Cochran test and I2 and was accounted by a random-effects (RE) model.  Main outcomes and measures:   Overall survival; secondary outcomes were symptomatic skeletal event (SSE)-free survival and adverse events.  Results:   Based on 6 randomized clinical trials including 2081 patients, RI use was significantly associated with OS compared with no RI use (HR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.77-0.95; P = .004) with high heterogeneity (χ25 = 24.46; P < .001; I2 = 80%), but this association disappeared when using an RE model (HR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.61-1.06; P = .12; τ2 = 0.08). The heterogeneity is explained both by the type of RI and by the inclusion of 2 outlier trials that included 275 patients; the OS benefit was significantly higher with the α-emitting RI 223Ra (HR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.58-0.83) but not significant with the β-emitting RI strontium-89 (HR, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.84-1.10) (P for interaction = .004). Excluding the outlier trials led to an overall HR of 0.82 (95% CI, 0.73-0.92; P < .001) (between-trial heterogeneity: χ23 = 6.51; P = .09; I2 = 54%) using an FE model and an HR of 0.80 (95% CI, 0.65-0.99; P = .04; τ2 = 0.02) using an RE model. The HR for SSE-free survival was 0.81 (95% CI, 0.69-0.93; P = .004) (between-trial heterogeneity: χ23 = 6.71; P = .08; I2 = 55%) when using an FE model and was 0.76 (95% CI, 0.58-1.01; P = .06; τ2 = 0.04) when using an RE model. There were more hematological toxic effects with RI use compared with no RI use (OR, 1.48; 95% CI, 1.17-1.88; P = .001).  Conclusions and relevance:   In metastatic CRPC, a significant improvement of OS and SSE-free survival was obtained with bone-targeted α-emitting but not β-emitting RIs.

Objective:   To determine the association between new unconfirmed lesions detected on a follow-up bone scintigram (bone scan) and outcomes in enzalutamide-treated men with mCRPC.  Design, setting, and participants:   This post hoc, retrospective secondary analysis of 1672 enzalutamide-treated men from 2 phase 3, randomized mCRPC studies (PREVAIL and AFFIRM) before or after treatment with docetaxel was conducted from April 12, 2018, to July 25, 2019. Participants were men from the enzalutamide groups of the 2 studies with a decrease in prostate-specific antigen level at any time or with stable disease or soft-tissue disease responding to treatment based onradiologic findings.  Intervention:   Enzalutamide, 160 mg once daily.  Main outcomes and measures:   The clinical significance of new lesions detected on the first (early) or second (late) posttreatment bone scan, without an unfavorable change in prostate-specific antigen level or soft-tissue progression, was investigated. Associations of new unconfirmed lesions with radiographic progression-free survival, overall survival, decrease in prostate-specific antigen level, objective response in soft tissue, and quality of life were evaluated.  Results:   Among the 643 men (median age, 72 years [range, 43-93 years]) in PREVAIL, early and late unconfirmed lesions were observed in 177 men (27.5%) with stable disease or disease responding to enzalutamide. Among the 404 men (median age, 70 years [range, 41-88 years]) in AFFIRM, early and late unconfirmed lesions were observed in 73 men (18.1%) with stable disease or disease responding to enzalutamide. In PREVAIL, men with new unconfirmed lesions had median radiographic progression-free survival (hazard ratio [HR], 1.37 [95% CI, 0.81-2.30]; P = .23) and median overall survival (HR, 1.25 [95% CI, 0.85-1.83]) in the chemotherapy-naive setting similar to men those of men without such new lesions. In AFFIRM, the median overall survival (HR, 1.94 [95% CI, 1.10-3.44]) was reduced among men with unconfirmed bone lesions, but the median radiographic progression-free survival was not reduced (HR, 1.21 [95% CI, 0.83-1.75]; P = .32). Quality of life over time was similar regardless of the presence of new unconfirmed lesions detected on a follow-up bone scan in either setting.  Conclusions and relevance:   These results suggest that new unconfirmed lesions detected on follow-up bone scans may represent pseudoprogression in men with mCRPC and are indicative of a favorable treatment response to enzalutamide. The detection of new unconfirmed bone lesions in men with mCRPC that responded to treatment with enzalutamide after docetaxel appears to be associated with worse overall survival and may represent true progression, thus highlighting the need for improved functional bone metastasis imaging.

Hypocalcaemia has been reported as one of the serious adverse sequelae of use of denosumab. We present a case of refractory hypocalcaemia following administration of a single dose of denosumab in a patient with metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer. The patient's serum calcium and vitamin D concentrations and renal function were normal prior to denosumab administration. Serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) level was however elevated pre-morbidly consistent with known bone metastases. The patient was treated with high-dose oral and IV calcium without any appreciable response in serum calcium. During his 30-day hospital admission, he demonstrated disease progression with development of new liver metastases and bone marrow involvement. Normocalcaemia was not achieved despite 1 month of aggressive therapy. Given the patient was asymptomatic and prognosis guarded, he was eventually discharged for ongoing supportive care under the palliative care team.  Learning points:   Denosumab is a potent anti-resorptive therapy and hypocalcaemia is one of the known adverse effects. Serum calcium and vitamin D concentrations must be replete prior to administration of denosumab to reduce the risk of hypocalcaemia. Denosumab has been proven to be more effective than zoledronic acid in preventing skeletal-related adverse effects in patients with metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer.""","""['Florence Gunawan', 'Elizabeth George', 'Mark Kotowicz']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Endocrinol Diabetes Metab Case Rep""","""['Hypocalcaemia in patients with metastatic bone disease treated with denosumab.', 'Hypocalcaemia in patients with prostate cancer treated with a bisphosphonate or denosumab: prevention supports treatment completion.', 'Hypocalcaemia following denosumab in prostate cancer: A clinical review.', 'Denosumab-associated hypocalcaemia: incidence, severity and patient characteristics in a tertiary hospital setting.', 'Severe and refractory hypocalcaemia secondary to osteoblastic bone metastases in bladder signet ring carcinoma: A case report and literature review.']"""

The optimal sequencing of these therapies is unclear. Our phase III trial compared neoadjuvant versus concurrent initiation of ADT in combination with dose-escalated prostate RT (PRT).  Patients and methods:   Patients with newly diagnosed LPCa with Gleason score ≤ 7, clinical stage T1b to T3a, and prostate-specific antigen < 30 ng/mL were randomly allocated to neoadjuvant and concurrent ADT for 6 months starting 4 months before RT (neoadjuvant group) or concurrent and adjuvant ADT for 6 months starting simultaneously with RT (concurrent group). The primary end point was biochemical relapse-free survival (bRFS). Stratified log-rank test was used to compare bRFS and overall survival (OS). Incidence of grade ≥ 3 late RT-related toxicities was compared by log-rank test.  Results:   Overall, 432 patients were randomly assigned to the neoadjuvant (n = 215) or concurrent group (n = 217). At 10 years, bRFS rates for the two groups were 80.5% and 87.4%, respectively. Ten-year OS rates were 76.4% and 73.7%, respectively. There was no significant difference in bRFS (P = .10) or OS (P = .70) between the two groups. Relative to the neoadjuvant group, the hazard ratio for the concurrent group was 0.66 (95% CI, 0.41 to 1.07) for bRFS and 0.94 (95% CI, 0.68 to 1.30) for OS. No significant difference was observed in the 3-year incidence of late RT-related grade ≥ 3 GI (2.5% v 3.9%) or genitourinary toxicity (2.9% v 2.9%).  Conclusion:   In our study, there was no statistically significant difference in bRFS between the two treatment groups. Similarly, no difference was seen in OS or late RT-related toxicities.

Methods:   Extended pelvic lymph node dissection was used to evaluate patients with lymph node involvement. We retrospectively analyzed consecutive 102 patients with high-risk prostate cancer who underwent extended pelvic lymph node dissection at our institution between 2011 and 2017. To evaluate the index lesion volume at multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mrV), lesions were manually contoured on each T2-weighted axial slice in combination with diffusion-weighted and dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging and integrated using image analysis software. Logistic regression analysis was performed to identify predictors of lymph node involvement.  Results:   The median mrV was 1.4 ml (range 0-30.1 ml), and the median number of resected lymph nodes was 14 (range 7-38). Among 102 patients, 28 (28%) had lymph node involvement. Multivariate analysis identified significant predictors of lymph node involvement as follows: biopsy Gleason-grade group 5 (odds ratio = 17.2; 95% confidence interval, 2.1-299.0; P = 0.005), preoperative mrV (odds ratio = 1.14; 95% confidence interval, 1.02-1.30; P = 0.025) and percentage of positive cores with highest Gleason-grade group (odds ratio = 1.05; 95% confidence interval, 1.01-1.10; P = 0.005). Lymph node involvement was prevalent (69%) among tumors with Gleason-grade group 5 and mrV ≥3.4 ml, but was infrequently (10%) present among tumors with Gleason-grade group ≤4 and mrV <3.4 ml.  Conclusions:   The combination of biopsy Gleason-grade and mrV may serve as a useful tool to stratify patients according to their risk of nodal metastases.""","""['Koji Hatano', 'Junichiro Tanaka', 'Yasutomo Nakai', 'Masashi Nakayama', 'Ken-Ichi Kakimoto', 'Katsuyuki Nakanishi', 'Kazuo Nishimura']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Jpn J Clin Oncol""","""['Preoperative multiparametric MRI of the prostate for the prediction of lymph node metastases in prostate cancer patients treated with extended pelvic lymph node dissection.', 'Development and External Validation of a Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging and International Society of Urological Pathology Based Add-On Prediction Tool to Identify Prostate Cancer Candidates for Pelvic Lymph Node Dissection.', 'External validation of the updated nomogram predicting lymph node invasion in patients with prostate cancer undergoing extended pelvic lymph node dissection.', 'Predicting pelvic lymph node involvement in current-era prostate cancer.', 'Do low-grade and low-volume prostate cancers bear the hallmarks of malignancy?', 'Multiparametric MRI-based radiomics model to predict pelvic lymph node invasion for patients with prostate cancer.', 'Artificial Intelligence Combined With Big Data to Predict Lymph Node Involvement in Prostate Cancer: A Population-Based Study.', 'Extracellular vesicles in prostate cancer: a narrative review.']"""

Conventional radiologic imaging techniques are insufficient to reliably detect lymph node metastases in prostate cancer. Despite promising results, there is limited published data on the diagnostic accuracy of PSMA PET-CT to assess local nodal metastases prior to radical prostatectomy. This study aims to assess the diagnostic efficacy of 68Ga PSMA PET-CT in local lymph node staging of high risk primary prostate cancer when compared to histopathological findings following radical prostatectomy with pelvic lymph node dissection.  Methods:   We retrospectively analysed consecutive patients with high risk primary prostate cancer referred by urologists for primary staging PSMA PET-CT using a 68Ga-labeled PSMA ligand, Glu-NH-CO-NHLys-(Ahx)-[HBEDD-CC], from October 2015 to October 2017. The scans of patients who underwent radical prostatectomy with pelvic lymph node dissection were interpreted by the consensus reading of two experienced nuclear medicine physicians blinded to clinical and histopathological data. The contemporaneous records of the referring urologists were retrospectively reviewed for noteworthy unexpected PET findings that altered their personal preference for surgical management.  Results:   Seventy-one patients were recruited and analysed. PSMA PET-CT showed findings compatible with local disease in 47 patients (66.2%), lymph node metastases in 10 patients (14.1%) and distant metastases in 14 patients (19.7%). Twenty-eight patients (twenty-seven of whom had local disease only) underwent surgery yielding 214 lymph nodes, all of which were negative on histopathological analysis. On a node-based analysis, 213 of 214 lymph nodes were accurately identified as negative for disease with a negative predictive value of 100%. 11 patients had unexpected PET findings contemporaneously documented by urologists to alter their preference for surgical management.  Conclusions:   PSMA PET-CT appears to have a high negative predictive value for local lymph node metastases in high risk primary prostate cancer when compared to histopathological findings following radical prostatectomy with pelvic lymph node dissection.""","""['Labib Ataur Rahman', 'Damacent Rutagengwa', 'Peter Lin', 'Michael Lin', 'June Yap', 'Ken Lai', 'Pascal Mancuso', 'Prem Rathore', 'Kayvan Haghighi', 'Paul Gassner', 'Lee Hao Wong', 'Nestor Lalak']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Cancer Imaging""","""['Primary lymph-node staging with 68Ga-PSMA PET in high-risk prostate cancer: pathologic correlation with extended pelvic lymphadenectomy specimens.', 'Diagnostic Accuracy of 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET for Pelvic Nodal Metastasis Detection Prior to Radical Prostatectomy and Pelvic Lymph Node Dissection: A Multicenter Prospective Phase 3 Imaging Trial.', 'Histological comparison between predictive value of preoperative 3-T multiparametric MRI and 68 Ga-PSMA PET/CT scan for pathological outcomes at radical prostatectomy and pelvic lymph node dissection for prostate cancer.', 'Use of gallium-68 prostate-specific membrane antigen positron-emission tomography for detecting lymph node metastases in primary and recurrent prostate cancer and location of recurrence after radical prostatectomy: an overview of the current literature.', 'Can Negative Prostate-specific Membrane Antigen Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography Avoid the Need for Pelvic Lymph Node Dissection in Newly Diagnosed Prostate Cancer Patients?

The purpose of this study is to present a novel delivery system (AIM-Brachy) design that can enable dynamic-shield IMBT for prostate cancer.  Methods:   The AIM-Brachy system dynamically controls the rotation of platinum shields, placed within interstitial catheters, which partially collimate the radiation emitted from an 169 Yb source. Conventional HDR BT (10 Ci 192 Ir) and IMBT (18 Ci 169 Yb) plans were generated for 12 patients using an in-house column generation-based optimizer, coupled to a Geant4-based dose calculation engine, RapidBrachyMC. Treatment plans were normalized to match the same PTV D90 coverage as the clinical plan. Intershield attenuation effects were taken into account. A sensitivity analysis was performed to evaluate the dosimetric impact of systematic longitudinal source positioning errors ( ± 1 mm, ± 2 mm, and ± 3 mm) and rotational errors ( ± 5 ∘ , ± 10 ∘ , and ± 15 ∘ ) on clinically relevant parameters (PTV D90 and urethra D10 ).  Results:   The platinum shield reduced the dose rate on the shielded side at 1 cm to 18.1% of the dose rate on the unshielded side. For equal PTV D90 coverage, the urethral D10 was reduced by 13.3% ± 4.7%, without change to other plan quality indices (PTV V100 , V150, V200 , bladder V75 , rectum V75 , HI, COIN). Delivery times for HDR BT and IMBT were 9.2 ± 1.6 min and 18.6 ± 4.0 min, respectively. In general, the PTV D90 was more sensitive to source positioning errors than rotational errors, while the urethral D10 was more sensitive to rotational errors than source positioning errors. For a typical range of positioning errors ( ± 1 mm, ± 5 ∘ ), the overall tolerance was <2%.  Conclusions:   The AIM-Brachy system was proposed to deliver dynamic-shield IMBT for prostate cancer with the potential to create a low dose tunnel within the urethra. The urethra-sparing properties are desirable to minimize the occurrence and severity of urethral strictures or, alternatively, to provide a method for dose escalation.""","""['Gabriel Famulari', 'Marie Duclos', 'Shirin A Enger']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['169 Yb-based rotating shield brachytherapy for prostate cancer.', 'A novel minimally invasive dynamic-shield, intensity-modulated brachytherapy system for the treatment of cervical cancer.', 'Direction modulated brachytherapy (DMBT) for treatment of cervical cancer: A planning study with 192 Ir, 60 Co, and 169 Yb HDR sources.', 'Emerging technologies in brachytherapy.', 'In vivo dosimetry in brachytherapy: Requirements and future directions for research, development, and clinical practice.', '169 Yb-based rotating shield brachytherapy for prostate cancer.']"""

Methods:   Patients with histologically proven focal low- to intermediate-risk PCA with a single PIRADS 4/5 lesion were treated with percutaneous interstitial HDR brachytherapy in a single fraction with a minimum dose for the gross tumor volume of 20 Gy while sparing the organ at risk (OAR). Using a 3T-MRI, brachytherapy catheters were placed transgluteal in freehand technique. No antibiotic therapy or general analgesics were administered. Patient data, procedure time, patient discomfort, and complications were recorded. Quarterly PSA controls, biannual follow-up imaging, and annual re-biopsy were planned.  Results:   So far, 9 patients were successfully treated and followed for 6 months. Mean intervention time was 34 min. Using the VAS scale, the pain reported for the intervention ranged from 2 to 3. Short-term follow-up showed no acute genitourinary or gastrointestinal toxicity so far. None of the patients displayed signs of infection. PSA levels in all patients decreased significantly. On follow up no residual PCA was detected treated region so far. PSA levels in all patients decreased significantly. On follow-up, no residual PCA was detected so far.  Conclusions:   MR-guided single-fraction focal HDR brachytherapy for localized PCA is feasible as well as safe for the individual patient.

In contrast, miR-221 is downregulated in prostate cancer (PCa), thereby implying a tumour suppressive function. By using proliferation and apoptosis assays, we show a novel feature of miR-221 in PCa cells: instead of inducing TRAIL resistance, miR-221 sensitized cells towards TRAIL-induced proliferation inhibition and apoptosis induction. Partially responsible for this effect was the interferon-mediated gene signature, which among other things contained an endogenous overexpression of the TRAIL encoding gene TNFSF10. This TRAIL-friendly environment was provoked by downregulation of the established miR-221 target gene SOCS3. Moreover, we introduced PIK3R1 as a target gene of miR-221 in PCa cells. Proliferation assays showed that siRNA-mediated downregulation of SOCS3 and PIK3R1 mimicked the effect of miR-221 on TRAIL sensitivity. Finally, Western blotting experiments confirmed lower amounts of phospho-Akt after siRNA-mediated downregulation of PIK3R1 in PC3 cells. Our results further support the tumour suppressing role of miR-221 in PCa, since it sensitises PCa cells towards TRAIL by regulating the expression of the oncogenes SOCS3 and PIK3R1.

In the present study, we evaluated the efficacy of MEP against prostate cancer (PCa) and established the molecular basis of its effect in in vitro and in vivo models. We observed that MEP treatment resulted in a significant decrease in the growth and viability of PCa cells, associated with arrest in the G1/S phase of the cell cycle. Apoptosis was confirmed as the primary mode of MEP-induced cell death through activation of the intrinsic apoptotic machinery. Proteomic and biochemical studies identified BiP as an important target of MEP with the activation of the ER stress pathway, as a potential mechanism driving MEP-induced apoptosis. The extract exhibited strong efficacy in the PCa xenograft mouse model with significant inhibition of tumor growth and reduced tumor burden. Taken together, our findings indicate that MEP-induced apoptosis in PCa cells concomitant with the activation of the ER stress pathways results in the inhibition of tumor growth, in vitro and in vivo.

ERG rearrangement is a genomic alteration frequently found in PCa and its prognostic significance has yielded mixed results. Although the association of PTEN and ERG biomarkers has potential impact on clinical outcomes, studies examining the two genes simultaneously are scarce in Brazilian populations. In this study, we retrospectively examined the relationship between ERG expression and PTEN loss in 119 surgically treated prostate cancer patients from Northeastern Brazil through immunohistochemical analysis. ERG expression was found in 41.0% (48/117) of cases and the loss of PTEN detected in 38.1% (40/105) of samples. ERG-positive cases were significantly associated with lower prostate weight; ERG negatively correlated with Gleason score above 6. The lack of associations for PTEN loss alone in this cohort is counter to the literature, which shows that PTEN loss is usually associated with more aggressive disease. The overlapping of the two biomarkers revealed that samples with positive ERG expression without PTEN loss were associated with lower Gleason and lower Grade group.

Recently, it has been confirmed that CD146 has been involved in progression and poor overall survival of many cancers including breast cancer. Importantly, in independent studies, CD146 was reported to be a trigger of epithelial to mesenchymal transition in breast cancer cells. The goal of our current study was to verify the potential involvement of epigenetic mechanism behind the regulation of CD146 expression in breast cancer cells, as it has been previously reported in prostate cancer. First, we analysed the response of breast cancer cell lines, differing in the initial CD146 mRNA and protein content, to epigenetic modifier, 5-aza-2-deoxycytidine, and subsequently the methylation status of CD146 gene promoter was investigated, using direct bisulfite sequencing. We observed that treatment with demethylating agent led to induction of CD146 expression in all analysed breast cancer cell lines, both at mRNA and protein level, what was accompanied by increased expression of selected mesenchymal markers. Importantly, CD146 gene promoter analysis showed aberrant CpG island methylation in 2 out of 3 studied breast cancer cells lines, indicating epigenetic regulation of CD146 gene expression. In conclusion, our study revealed, for the first time, that aberrant methylation maybe involved in expression control of CD146, a very potent EMT inducer in breast cancer cells. Altogether, the data obtained may provide the basis for novel therapies as well as diagnostic approaches enabling sensitive and very accurate detection of breast cancer cells.""","""['Paulina Dudzik', 'Sonia Elzbieta Trojan', 'Barbara Ostrowska', 'Małgorzata Lasota', 'Joanna Dulińska-Litewka', 'Piotr Laidler', 'Kinga Anna Kocemba-Pilarczyk']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Acta Biochim Pol""","""['The Epigenetic Modifier 5-Aza-2-deoxycytidine Triggers the Expression of CD146 Gene in Prostate Cancer Cells.', 'MCAM/CD146 promotes tamoxifen resistance in breast cancer cells through induction of epithelial-mesenchymal transition, decreased ERα expression and AKT activation.', 'Aberrant NDRG1 methylation associated with its decreased expression and clinicopathological significance in breast cancer.', 'Aberrant promoter CpG methylation and its translational applications in breast cancer.', 'Epigenetic Regulation of Breast Cancer Stem Cells Contributing to Carcinogenesis and Therapeutic Implications.', 'The use of RNA-based treatments in the field of cancer immunotherapy.', 'Pro- and anti-tumour activities of CD146/MCAM in breast cancer result from its heterogeneous expression and association with epithelial to mesenchymal transition.', 'Overexpression of MCAM induced by SMYD2-H3K36me2 in breast cancer stem cell properties.', 'TET2-mediated epigenetic reprogramming of breast cancer cells impairs lysosome biogenesis.', 'CD146 as a Prognostic-Related Biomarker in ccRCC Correlating With Immune Infiltrates.']"""

Purpose:   To characterize the clinical and MRI features of clinically significant prostate cancer (csPCa) with discrepant Gleason score (GS) in MRI-US fusion biopsy.  Material and methods:   A total of 400 consecutive patients with suspected cancer lesions who underwent MRI-US fusion biopsy and subsequent prostatectomy were included. In the comparison of biopsy GS with pathology GS, matched lesions were defined as a GS, and discrepant lesions were defined as an upgrade of the GS. Descriptive statistics were used to define clinical characteristics, including age, prostate-specific antigen (PSA), PSA density, and maximal cancer core length (MCCL). Differences between lesions with matched and discrepant GS were determined considering the location and PI-RADS v2 score. A paired comparison of the volumes between the two groups was performed.  Results:   There were 130 lesions with discrepant GS in 124 patients. There was no significant difference in the age, PSA, and PSA density between the two groups, except for the MCCL (P = 0.028). The lesions were distributed in the peripheral (n = 88) and transition (n = 42) zones; 33, 50, and 47 lesions were at the apex, mid-gland, and base levels, respectively. PI-RADS scores were as follows: 2 (n = 5), 3 (n = 8), 4 (n = 68), and 5 (n = 39).

Oxygen depletion has been proposed as the underlying mechanism, but in vitro data to support this have been lacking. The aim of the current study was to compare FLASH to CONV irradiation under different oxygen concentrations in vitro.  Methods:   Prostate cancer cells were irradiated at different oxygen concentrations (relative partial pressure ranging between 1.6 and 20%) with a 10 MeV electron beam at a dose rate of either 600 Gy/s (FLASH) or 14 Gy/min (CONV), using a modified clinical linear accelerator. We evaluated the surviving fraction of cells using clonogenic assays after irradiation with doses ranging from 0 to 25 Gy.  Results:   Under normoxic conditions, no differences between FLASH and CONV irradiation were found. For hypoxic cells (1.6%), the radiation response was similar up to a dose of about 5-10 Gy, above which increased survival was shown for FLASH compared to CONV irradiation. The increased survival was shown to be significant at 18 Gy, and the effect was shown to depend on oxygen concentration.  Conclusion:   The in vitro FLASH effect depends on oxygen concentration. Further studies to characterize and optimize the use of FLASH in order to widen the therapeutic window are indicated.

The long-term health outcomes associated with testosterone therapy remain unknown, however.  Objective:   To compare health outcomes between long-term opioid users with testosterone deficiency who filled testosterone prescriptions and those with the same condition but who did not receive testosterone treatment.  Design, setting, and participants:   This cohort study focused on men in the care of the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) facilities throughout the United States from October 1, 2008, to September 30, 2014. It included male veterans who were long-term opioid users, had low testosterone levels (<300 ng/dL), and received either a testosterone prescription or any other prescription. It excluded male patients with HIV infection, gender dysphoria, or prostate cancer and those who received testosterone in fiscal year 2008. Data were analyzed from April 1, 2017, to April 30, 2019.  Exposure:   Prescription for testosterone.  Main outcomes and measures:   All-cause mortality and incidence of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), vertebral or femoral fractures, and anemia during the 6-year follow-up through September 30, 2015.  Results:   After exclusions, 21 272 long-term opioid users (mean [SD] age, 53 [10] years; n = 16 689 [78.5%] white) with low total or free testosterone levels were included for analysis, of whom 14 121 (66.4%) received testosterone and 7151 (33.6%) did not. At baseline, compared with opioid users who did not receive testosterone, long-term opioid users who received testosterone treatment were more likely to have obesity (43.7% vs 49.0%; P < .001), hyperlipidemia (43.0% vs 48.8%; P < .001), and hypertension (53.9% vs 55.2%; P = .07) but had lower prevalence of coronary artery disease (15.9% vs 12.9%; P < .001) and stroke (2.4% vs 1.3%; P < .001). After adjusting for covariates, opioid users who received testosterone had significantly lower all-cause mortality (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.51; 95% CI, 0.42-0.61) and lower incidence of MACE (HR = 0.58; 95% CI, 0.51-0.67), femoral or hip fractures (HR = 0.68; 95% CI, 0.48-0.96), and anemia (HR = 0.73; 95% CI, 0.68-0.79) during the follow-up period of up to 6 years, compared with their counterparts without a testosterone prescription. In covariate-adjusted models, men who received opioids plus testosterone were more likely to have resolved anemia compared with those who received opioids only during the 6-year follow-up (HR = 1.16; 95% CI, 1.02-1.31). Similar results were obtained in propensity score-matched models and when analyses were restricted to opioid users with noncancer pain or those who did not receive glucocorticoids.  Conclusions and relevance:   This study found that, in the VHA system, male long-term opioid users with testosterone deficiency who were treated with opioid and testosterone medications had significantly lower all-cause mortality and significantly lower incidence of MACE, femoral or hip fractures, and anemia after a multiyear follow-up.

Men with cT2 or lower histologically proven prostate cancer (Gleason 3+3=6 or Gleason 3+4=7 with 10% or less Gleason pattern 4 overall and less than 2 cores Gleason pattern 4) eligible for surveillance were included in the study. Men underwent baseline multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging and saturation biopsy followed by serial annual multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging until a 3-year end point per protocol saturation biopsy. The standardized 1-year confirmatory biopsy was omitted and biopsies during the protocol were triggered based on new abnormalities on multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging and prostate specific antigen density.  Results:   We report the prespecified interim analysis of the first 100 men at 3 years. At baseline the median age was 64.5 (IQR 57.25-69) years, prostate specific antigen was 4.7 ng/ml (IQR 3.4-6.6), 91% had Gleason 3+3=6 prostate cancer and multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging was negative (Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System 1/2/3) in 87% of men. Within 3 years 21% experienced pathological progression. The positive predictive value, negative predictive value, sensitivity and specificity for detection of clinically significant prostate cancer by surveillance multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging was 45%, 89%, 61% and 80%, respectively. Positive surveillance magnetic resonance imaging (p=0.002) and prostate specific antigen density greater than 0.2 ng/ml (p=0.042) had significant predictive value for clinically significant prostate cancer.  Conclusions:   Our novel active surveillance protocol incorporating multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging detected most cases of disease progression and may enable confirmatory biopsy to be deferred, but should not replace 3-year surveillance biopsy altogether due to occasional magnetic resonance imaging invisible tumors.""","""['Amer Amin', 'Matthijs J Scheltema', 'Ron Shnier', 'Alexandar Blazevski', 'Daniel Moses', 'Thomas Cusick', 'Amila Siriwardena', 'Brian Yuen', 'Pim J van Leeuwen', 'Anne Maree Haynes', 'Jayne Matthews', 'Phillip Brenner', ""Gordon O'Neill"", 'Carlo Yuen', 'Warick Delprado', 'Phillip Stricker', 'James Thompson']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""J Urol""","""[""Re: The Magnetic Resonance Imaging in Active Surveillance (MRIAS) Trial: Use of Baseline Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Saturation Biopsy to Reduce the Frequency of Surveillance Prostate BiopsiesA.

It has the potential to grow and cause metastasis. The detection of circulating prostate cells (CPCs) and bone marrow micro-metastasis could represent different sub-types of MRD.  Objective:   To determine biochemical failure free survival and time to failure, the presence of circulating prostate cells and bone marrow micro-metastasis in men treated for low risk prostate cancer.  Hypothesis:   The presence of MRD and not the treatment modality determines the results of therapy.  Methods:   Blood and bone marrow samples were taken one month after completing treatment to detect CPCs and micro-metastasis. Patients were classified into three groups; A: CPC negative, micro-metastasis negative, B: CPC negative, micro-metastasis positive and C: CPC positive. Biochemical failure was defined as a PSA >0.2ng/ml after radical prostatectomy and >2.0ng/ml post nadir after radiotherapy. After 10 years of follow up the Kaplan-Meier survival curve was determined and using a flexible adjusted parametric model the mean restricted survival time (MRST) was calculated for all groups.  Results:   343 men participated, 183 post surgery and 160 post radiotherapy, 181 (53%) had clinical stage T1 and 162 (47%) clinical stage T2a. There were no differences in treatment results between prostatectomy and radiotherapy. T1 patients had a significantly lower frequency of MRD than T2 patients (20% versus 67% p<0.001). Patients negative for MRD (Group A) had a 97% 10-year survival rate and a MRST to failure of 9.9 years. Men with only micro-metastasis (Group B) had a survival rate similar to Group A during the first five years, afterwards there was increasing treatment failure (late failure). Men positive for CPCs had a high risk of early failure.  Conclusions:   The treatment results of surgery and radiotherapy are similar and depend on the sub-type of MRD. Men negative for MRD could be considered cured with a biochemical failure free survival of >95% at 10 years. The sub-type of MRD determines early or late failure and could be useful in the risk classification of patients after curative treatment.""","""['Nigel P Murray', 'Sócrates Aedo', 'Cynthia Fuentealba', 'Aníbal Salazar', 'Eduardo Reyes', 'Marco Antonio Lopez', 'Simona Minzer']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Arch Esp Urol""","""['Circulating prostate cells and bone marrow micrometastasis are determinant in risk and time to biochemical progression in localized prostate cancer..', 'CAPRA score vs minimal residual disease as predictors of biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy..', 'Subtypes of minimal residual disease, association with Gleason score, risk and time to biochemical failure in pT2 prostate cancer treated with radical prostatectomy.', 'The presence of secondary circulating prostate tumour cells determines the risk of biochemical relapse for patients with low- and intermediate-risk prostate cancer who are treated only with external radiotherapy.', 'No difference in six-year biochemical failure rates with or without pelvic lymph node dissection during radical prostatectomy in low-risk patients with localized prostate cancer.', 'Increasing Immune Dysfunction is Associated with Increasing Matrix-Metalloproteinase-2 Expression and Predicts Biochemical Failure in Men with Bone Marrow Micro-Metastasis Positive Localized Prostate Cancer.', 'Antimicrobial peptide 17BIPHE2 inhibits the proliferation of lung cancer cells in vitro and in vivo by regulating the ERK signaling pathway.', 'The CAPRA score versus sub-types of minimal residual disease to predict biochemical failure after external beam radiotherapy.']"""

We examined these associations overall and according to clinical and lifestyle parameters.  Methods:   We identified male participants in the Danish Diet, Cancer and Health Study (n = 26,339), holding information on anthropometric measures and lifestyle factors. From Danish nationwide registries and medical records, we retrieved complete prescription histories and prostate cancer occurrence and characteristics. Cox regression was used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) for prostate cancer associated with low-dose aspirin or nonaspirin NSAID use, overall and by clinical characteristics, anthropometric measures, and lifestyle factors.  Results:   We identified 1,927 prostate cancer cases during a median follow-up of 17.0 years. Low-dose aspirin use was not associated with overall prostate cancer risk, but a reduced HR for nonaggressive prostate cancer (high use [≥ 1,825 tablets]: 0.79; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.60-1.04) and an increased HR for aggressive disease (high use: 1.27; 95% CI 1.00-1.61) was observed with low-dose aspirin use. Long-term, high-intensity use (≥ 10 years with ≥ 0.25 defined daily doses/day) of nonaspirin NSAIDs was associated with an increased HR for prostate cancer (1.35, 95% CI 0.99-1.84), confined to localized and nonaggressive disease. No consistent variation in HRs was seen in analyses stratified by height, body mass index, smoking, and alcohol use.  Conclusion:   Low-dose aspirin or other NSAID use was not associated with reduced prostate cancer risk, neither overall nor according to anthropometric measures, smoking, or alcohol use.

Yet, little is known about the cellular DNA repair processes that take place between radiation fractions, even though understanding the molecular mechanisms promoting cancer cell recovery and survival could improve patient outcome and identify new avenues for targeted intervention. To address this knowledge gap, we systematically characterized how cells respond differentially to multifractionated and single-dose radiotherapy, using a combination of genetics-based and functional approaches. We found that both cancer cells and normal fibroblasts exhibited enhanced survival after multifractionated irradiation compared with an equivalent single dose of irradiation, and this effect was entirely dependent on 53BP1-mediated NHEJ. Furthermore, we identified RIF1 as the critical effector of 53BP1. Inhibiting 53BP1 recruitment to damaged chromatin completely abolished the survival advantage after multifractionated irradiation and could not be reversed by suppressing excessive end resection. Analysis of the TCGA database revealed lower expression of 53BP1 pathway genes in prostate cancer, suggesting that multifractionated radiotherapy might be a favorable option for radio-oncologic treatment in this tumor type.

While initially effective, the cancer almost always recurs as a more aggressive castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Previous studies have demonstrated that chromatin modifying enzymes can play a critical role in the conversion to CRPC. However, only a handful of these potential pharmacological targets have been tested. Therefore, in this study, we conducted a focused shRNA screen of chromatin modifying enzymes previously shown to be involved in cellular differentiation. We found that altering the balance between histone methylation and demethylation impacted growth and proliferation. Of all genes tested, KDM3B, a histone H3K9 demethylase, was found to have the most antiproliferative effect. These results were phenocopied with a KDM3B CRISPR/Cas9 knockout. When tested in several PCa cell lines, the decrease in proliferation was remarkably specific to androgen-independent cells. Genetic rescue experiments showed that only the enzymatically active KDM3B could recover the phenotype. Surprisingly, despite the decreased proliferation of androgen-independent cell no alterations in the cell cycle distribution were observed following KDM3B knockdown. Whole transcriptome analyses revealed changes in the gene expression profile following loss of KDM3B, including downregulation of metabolic enzymes such as ARG2 and RDH11. Metabolomic analysis of KDM3B knockout showed a decrease in several critical amino acids. Overall, our work reveals, for the first time, the specificity and the dependence of KDM3B in CRPC proliferation.""","""['Hilal Saraç', 'Tunç Morova', 'Elisabete Pires', 'James McCullagh', 'Anıl Kaplan', 'Ahmet Cingöz', 'Tugba Bagci-Onder', 'Tamer Önder', 'Akane Kawamura', 'Nathan A Lack']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Oncogene""","""['c-MYC drives histone demethylase PHF8 during neuroendocrine differentiation and in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Targeting KDM4B that coactivates c-Myc-regulated metabolism to suppress tumor growth in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Histone demethylase KDM7A controls androgen receptor activity and tumor growth in prostate cancer.', 'EAU guidelines on prostate cancer.

The aim of this study was to characterize TP53 mutations and treatment history in prostate cancer.  Patients and methods:   This study included 143 patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer who had undergone ctDNA sequencing via Guardant360 testing. The presence or absence of TP53 mutations was analyzed along with treatment history for this group. TP53 mutations were further classified as gain of function (GOF) or not GOF, and analyzed with prior therapies.  Results:   Chi-square analysis was performed for treatment history and TP53 status (further specified as all TP53 mutations or only TP53 GOF mutations). There were no associations between prior receipt of abiraterone/enzalutamide therapy and all TP53 mutations, or between docetaxel therapy and all TP53 mutations. However, TP53 GOF mutations had a positive association with prior abiraterone/enzalutamide therapy (P = .047). There was no association of TP53 GOF mutations with prior docetaxel therapy. The most frequent alterations co-occurring with all TP53 mutations were in AR, BRAF, EGFR, MYC, and PIK3CA. Common coalterations with TP53 GOF mutations included AR, BRAF, EGFR, RB1, NF1, and PIK3CA.

This study evaluated whether re-experiencing stressful memories of a traumatic event was associated with prostate cancer incidence.  Methods:   Participants were males from one clinical center that monitors the health of first-responders (N = 6857). Monitoring began in July 2002 and occurs annually but does not include prostate cancer screening. Severity of physical exposures and of re-experiencing memories and stress responses were measured at study enrollment using standardized and validated methods in all participants. The outcome was incidence of diagnosed prostate cancer after enrollment (n = 68). Bivariate analyses provided age-adjusted incidence rates (aIR). Cox proportional hazards modeling was used to calculate incidence; hazards ratios (HR) were reported.  Results:   The mean age of responders on 9/11/2001 was 37.9 years. Prostate cancer incidence was lowest in responders with no re-experiencing stress (aIR = 250.83/100,000 person-years, [233.41-268.25]) and highest in responders with severe re-experiencing stress (aIR = 818.49/100,000 person-years, [801.07-835.91]). Cox proportional hazards regression revealed that re-experiencing the stressful events of 9/11/2001 was associated with increased prostate cancer incidence (HR = 1.96 [1.26-3.05], P = 0.003), even upon adjusting for confounders.  Conclusions:   This is the first study to identify a positive association between re-experiencing a traumatic event and prostate cancer incidence. Our results are consistent with recent rodent model evidence demonstrating a direct biological link between stress pathways and prostate tumorigenesis and offer new hypotheses in the causality of prostate cancer.""","""['Sean A P Clouston', 'Peifen Kuan', 'Roman Kotov', 'Soumyadeep Mukherjee', 'Patricia Thompson-Carino', 'Evelyn J Bromet', 'Benjamin J Luft']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""BMC Psychiatry""","""['Handgrip Strength of World Trade Center (WTC) Responders: The Role of Re-Experiencing Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) Symptoms.', 'Latent typologies of posttraumatic stress disorder in World Trade Center responders.', 'Post-disaster stressful life events and WTC-related posttraumatic stress, depressive symptoms, and overall functioning among responders to the World Trade Center disaster.', 'Health Trends among 9/11 Responders from 2011-2021: A Review of World Trade Center Health Program Statistics.', 'The enduring mental health impact of the September 11th terrorist attacks: challenges and lessons learned.', 'Circadian Rhythm Disruption as a Contributor to Racial Disparities in Prostate Cancer.', 'Integrated transcriptomic and metabolomic analysis of rat serum to investigate potential target of puerarin in the treatment post-traumatic stress disorder.', 'Temporal association of prostate cancer incidence with World Trade Center rescue/recovery work.', 'COVID-19 cumulative incidence, asymptomatic infections, and fatality in Long Island, NY, January-August 2020: A cohort of World Trade Center responders.', 'Mechanisms Supporting the Use of Beta-Blockers for the Management of Breast Cancer Bone Metastasis.']"""

Patients and Methods: Twenty-seven patients with previous HoLEP who underwent RARP were matched 1:1 with RARP patients with no history of transurethral surgery. Demographic, operative, oncologic, continence, and erectile function outcomes were analyzed. Results: Median time between HoLEP and RARP was 31 months with a mean prostate-specific antigen doubling time of 4.28 ng/mL/year. Operative times were significantly longer with higher bladder neck reconstruction rates and similarly low complication rates. Biochemical recurrence was relatively low (7%) in the HoLEP group, identical to the comparative group. Continence at last follow-up was not statistically significant between groups, although time to continence favored the non-HoLEP cohort. Erectile function recovery was generally poor in the post-HoLEP cohort (11%), although bilateral nerve sparing was rarely performed (11%). Compared with our initial experience, there were significant improvements in time to continence (16 vs 36 weeks). No T2 post-HoLEP RARP since 2010 has had a positive surgical margin.

Methods:   miR-1231 expression levels were detected in prostate cancer tissues and prostate cancer cell lines using qRT-PCR. The prognostic significance of miR-1231 in prostate cancer was assessed using the Kaplan-Meier curve and Cox regression analyses. Evaluation of the impact of ectopic expression or inhibition of miR-1231 on aggressive tumor behavior (cellular proliferation, migration, and invasion) of prostate cancer cell lines involved the CCK-8 and Transwell assays.  Results:   miR-1231 expression was downregulated in both prostate cancer tissues and cell lines. Downregulation of miR-1231 was significantly associated with lymph node metastasis, higher TNM stage, higher clinical stage, and shorter overall survival. The expression of miR-1231 was predicted as a prognostic factor for prostate cancer patients. Additionally, we found overexpression of miR-1231 suppressed proliferation, migration, and invasion of prostate cancer cell linesin vitro. EGFR was a direct target of miR-1231.  Conclusion:   Taken together, our results indicate that miR-1231 expression plays a tumor-suppressive role in prostate cancer.

It remains unclear how these results are presented and their management influence diagnostic characteristics.  Purpose:   To investigate the reporting and handling of equivocal imaging findings in diagnostic studies of bone metastases, and to assess the impact on diagnostic performance of the methods used to analyze equivocal findings. The conceptual issue was reified based on two actual observations.  Material and methods:   A recent meta-analysis of bone metastases in prostate cancer was conducted and data were obtained from a large clinical trial with a true reference of bone metastasis, where diagnostic characteristics were calculated with equivocal scans handled by: removal; considered malignant; considered benign; and intention-to-diagnose.  Results:   The meta-analysis included 18 trials where the median proportion of reported equivocal results was 27%. Eleven (61%) studies reported an equivocal option for the index test, 42% reported equivocal results and described how these were analyzed. The clinical trial included 583 prostate cancer patients with 20% equivocal results. The different methods of managing equivocal findings resulted in highly variable outcomes: sensitivity = 85%-100%; specificity = 78%-99%; and positive and negative predictive values = 44%-94% and 97%-100%, respectively. The diagnostic performances obtained using the four methods were differentially susceptible to the proportion of equivocal imaging findings and the prevalence of bone metastases.

Several MRI methods, among them MR elastography, are currently being discussed as candidates for supplementing conventional multiparametric MRI. This study aims to investigate the detection of PCa in fresh ex vivo human prostatectomy specimens using MR elastography.  Methods:   Fourteen fresh prostate specimens from men with clinically significant PCa without formalin fixation or prior radiation therapy were examined by MR elastography at 500 Hz immediately after radical prostatectomy in a 9.4T preclinical scanner. Specimens were divided into 12 segments for both calculation of storage modulus (G' in kilopascals) and pathology (Gleason score) as reference standard. Sensitivity, specificity, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve were calculated to assess PCa detection.  Results:   The mean G' and SD were as follows: all segments, 8.74 ± 5.26 kPa; healthy segments, 5.44 ± 4.40 kPa; and cancerous segments, 10.84 ± 4.65 kPa. The difference between healthy and cancerous segments was significant with P ≤ .001. Diagnostic performance assessed with the Youden index was as follows: sensitivity, 69%; specificity, 79%; area under the curve, 0.81; and cutoff, 10.67 kPa.  Conclusion:   Our results suggest that prostate MR elastography has the potential to improve diagnostic performance of multiparametric MRI, especially regarding its 2 major limitations: interobserver variability and low specificity.

In this study, we trained a neural network for generating Pareto optimal dose distributions, and evaluate the effects of the domain-specific loss on the model performance.  Methods:   In this study, three loss functions - mean squared error (MSE) loss, DVH loss, and adversarial (ADV) loss - were used to train and compare four instances of the neural network model: (a) MSE, (b) MSE + ADV, (c) MSE + DVH, and (d) MSE + DVH+ADV. The data for 70 prostate patients, including the planning target volume (PTV), and the organs at risk (OAR) were acquired as 96 × 96 × 24 dimension arrays at 5 mm3 voxel size. The dose influence arrays were calculated for 70 prostate patients, using a 7 equidistant coplanar beam setup. Using a scalarized multicriteria optimization for intensity-modulated radiation therapy, 1200 Pareto surface plans per patient were generated by pseudo-randomizing the PTV and OAR tradeoff weights. With 70 patients, the total number of plans generated was 84 000 plans. We divided the data into 54 training, 6 validation, and 10 testing patients. Each model was trained for a total of 100,000 iterations, with a batch size of 2. All models used the Adam optimizer, with a learning rate of 1 × 10-3 .  Results:   Training for 100 000 iterations took 1.5 days (MSE), 3.5 days (MSE+ADV), 2.3 days (MSE+DVH), and 3.8 days (MSE+DVH+ADV). After training, the prediction time of each model is 0.052 s. Quantitatively, the MSE+DVH+ADV model had the lowest prediction error of 0.038 (conformation), 0.026 (homogeneity), 0.298 (R50), 1.65% (D95), 2.14% (D98), and 2.43% (D99). The MSE model had the worst prediction error of 0.134 (conformation), 0.041 (homogeneity), 0.520 (R50), 3.91% (D95), 4.33% (D98), and 4.60% (D99). For both the mean dose PTV error and the max dose PTV, Body, Bladder and rectum error, the MSE+DVH+ADV outperformed all other models. Regardless of model, all predictions have an average mean and max dose error <2.8% and 4.2%, respectively.  Conclusion:   The MSE+DVH+ADV model performed the best in these categories, illustrating the importance of both human and learned domain knowledge. Expert human domain-specific knowledge can be the largest driver in the performance improvement, and adversarial learning can be used to further capture nuanced attributes in the data. The real-time prediction capabilities allow for a physician to quickly navigate the tradeoff space for a patient, and produce a dose distribution as a tangible endpoint for the dosimetrist to use for planning. This is expected to considerably reduce the treatment planning time, allowing for clinicians to focus their efforts on the difficult and demanding cases.""","""['Dan Nguyen', 'Rafe McBeth', 'Azar Sadeghnejad Barkousaraie', 'Gyanendra Bohara', 'Chenyang Shen', 'Xun Jia', 'Steve Jiang']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Using deep learning to predict beam-tunable Pareto optimal dose distribution for intensity-modulated radiation therapy.', 'Combining dense elements with attention mechanisms for 3D radiotherapy dose prediction on head and neck cancers.', 'A feasibility study on deep learning-based individualized 3D dose distribution prediction.', 'Robust optimization in lung treatment plans accounting for geometric uncertainty.', 'Artificial intelligence applications in intensity modulated radiation treatment planning: an overview.', 'Deep learning-based dose prediction in radiotherapy planning for head and neck cancer.', 'Automated treatment planning framework for brachytherapy of cervical cancer using 3D dose predictions.', 'TrDosePred: A deep learning dose prediction algorithm based on transformers for head and neck cancer radiotherapy.', 'Advances in Automated Treatment Planning.', 'Domain knowledge driven 3D dose prediction using moment-based loss function.']"""

Materials and methods:   Among 269 targeted biopsy procedures 222 men underwent robotic ultrasound magnetic resonance imaging fusion biopsy and 47 micro-ultrasound biopsy. Robotic ultrasound magnetic resonance imaging fusion biopsy was performed using the transperineal Artemis™ device while micro-ultrasound biopsy was performed transrectally with the high resolution ExactVu™ system. Random biopsies were performed in addition to targeted biopsy in both modalities. Prostate cancer detection rates and concordance between random and target biopsies were also assessed.  Results:   Groups were comparable in terms of age, prostate specific antigen, prostate volume and magnetic resonance PI-RADS (Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System) version 2 score. The micro-ultrasound biopsy group presented fewer biopsied cores in random and target approaches. In targeted biopsies micro-ultrasound biopsy cases presented higher detection of clinically significant disease (Gleason score greater than 6) than the robotic ultrasound magnetic resonance imaging fusion biopsy group (38% vs 23%, p=0.02). When considering prostate cancer detection regardless of Gleason score or prostate cancer detection by random+target biopsies, no difference was found between the groups. However, on a per core basis overall prostate cancer detection rates favored micro-ultrasound biopsy in random and targeted scenarios. In addition, the PRI-MUS (Prostate Risk Identification Using Micro-Ultrasound) score yielded by micro-ultrasound visualization was independently associated with improved cancer detection rates of clinically significant prostate cancer.  Conclusions:   In our initial experience micro-ultrasound biopsy featured a higher clinically significant prostate cancer detection rate in target cores than robotic ultrasound magnetic resonance imaging fusion biopsy, which was associated with target features in micro-ultrasound (PRI-MUS score).

TTB exhibits a prominent aggregation-induced emission (AIE) property with strong near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence in aggregates and is capable of efficiently generating ROS of O2•- and 1O2 under white light irradiation. The nanoparticles (RGD-4R-MPD/TTB NPs) with NIR emission (∼730 nm), high photostability, and low dark cytotoxicity are fabricated by encapsulating TTB within polymeric matrix and then modified with RGD-4R peptide. They show excellent performance in targeting PDT treatment of PC3, HeLa, and SKOV-3 cancer cells in vitro. The investigations on pharmacokinetics, biodistribution, and long-term tracing in vivo reveal that RGD-4R-MPD/TTB NPs can selectively accumulate in tumors for real-time, long-term image-guided PDT treatment. The RGD-4R-MPD/TTB NPs-mediated PDT in multiple xenograft tumor models disclose that the growth of cervical, prostate, and ovarian cancers in mice can be effectively inhibited. These results demonstrate that the reagents employing NIR fluorogen TTB as a photosensitizer could be promising candidates for in vivo image-guided PDT treatments of tumors.""","""['Jun Dai', 'Yinghao Li', 'Zi Long', 'Ruming Jiang', 'Zeyan Zhuang', 'Zhiming Wang', 'Zujin Zhao', 'Xiaoding Lou', 'Fan Xia', 'Ben Zhong Tang']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""ACS Nano""","""['Highly Efficient Multifunctional Organic Photosensitizer with Aggregation-Induced Emission for In Vivo Bioimaging and Photodynamic Therapy.', 'Core-shell polymeric nanoparticles co-loaded with photosensitizer and organic dye for photodynamic therapy guided by fluorescence imaging in near and short-wave infrared spectral regions.', 'Rational Design of a High-Performance Quinoxalinone-Based AIE Photosensitizer for Image-Guided Photodynamic Therapy.', 'Hybrid nanoparticle composites applied to photodynamic therapy: strategies and applications.', 'Metal Nanoparticles for Photodynamic Therapy: A Potential Treatment for Breast Cancer.', ""Orange/Red Benzo1,2-b:4,5-b'dithiophene 1,1,5,5-Tetraoxide-Based Emitters for Luminescent Solar Concentrators: Effect of Structures on Fluorescence Properties and Device Performances."", 'Platelet membrane camouflaged AIEgen-mediated photodynamic therapy improves the effectiveness of anti-PD-L1 immunotherapy in large-burden tumors.', 'Short-Wavelength Aggregation-Induced Emission Photosensitizers for Solid Tumor Therapy: Enhanced with White-Light Fiber Optic.', 'Ir(III) Complexes with AIE Characteristics for Biological Applications.', 'The commercial antibiotics with inherent AIE feature: In situ visualization of antibiotic metabolism and specifically differentiation of bacterial species and broad-spectrum therapy.']"""

Following this change, screening declined yet the complete impact on clinical presentation is not well defined in the screen-eligible population.  Objective:   To determine if the rates of PSA screening, prostate biopsy, incident prostate cancer detection, and stage IV at presentation in screen-eligible men in Kaiser Permanente Northern California changed following the 2012 USPSTF Prostate Cancer Screening recommendations.  Design:   Retrospective study spanning the years 2010 to 2015, in screen-eligible Kaiser Permanente Northern California members (African American men ages 45-69 and all other men ages 50-69) with no prior history of prostate cancer. Participants All screen-eligible, male members during 2010 (n = 403,931) to 2015 (n = 483,286) without a history of prostate cancer within all Kaiser Permanente Northern California facilities.  Main measures:   Annual rates of PSA testing, prostate biopsy, incident prostate cancer detection, and stage IV cancer at presentation were compared between the pre-guideline period, 2010 and 2011, and the post-guideline period, 2014 and 2015, in men under the age of 70.  Key results:   Following the 2012 USPSTF guideline change, screening rates declined 23.4% (95% CI 23.0-23.8%), biopsy rates declined 64.3% (95% CI 62.9-65.6%), and incident prostate cancer detection rates declined 53.5% (95% CI 50.1-56.7%) resulting in 1871 fewer incident cancers detected, and metastatic cancer rates increased 36.9% (95% CI 9.5-71.0%) resulting in 75 more stage IV cancers detected.  Conclusion:   Less screening resulted in a large decrease in cancer detection, some of which may be beneficial as many cancers may be indolent, yet this decrease occurred at the expense of an increase in metastatic cancer rates. For every 25 fewer cancers detected, one metastatic cancer was diagnosed. This information may be valuable in the shared decision-making process around prostate cancer screening.""","""['Joseph Presti Jr', 'Stacey Alexeeff', 'Brandon Horton', 'Stephanie Prausnitz', 'Andrew L Avins']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""J Gen Intern Med""","""['Changes in Prostate Cancer Presentation Following the 2012 USPSTF Screening Statement: Observational Study in a Multispecialty Group Practice.', 'PSA Screening: a Kind of Russian Roulette?', 'Impact of 2012 Prostate Cancer Screening Statement.', 'Prostate cancer screening practices in a large, integrated health system: 2007-2014.', 'Changing Provider PSA Screening Behavior Using Best Practice Advisories: Interventional Study in a Multispecialty Group Practice.', 'Changes in Prostate-Specific Antigen Testing Relative to the Revised US Preventive Services Task Force Recommendation on Prostate Cancer Screening.', 'Prostate-Specific Antigen-Based Screening for Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Evidence Review for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force Internet.', 'Recent Changes in Prostate Cancer Screening Practices and Epidemiology.', 'Colorectal Cancer Diagnosis: The Obstacles We Face in Determining a Non-Invasive Test and Current Advances in Biomarker Detection.', 'PSA Screening: a Kind of Russian Roulette?', 'Prostate Cancer: Community Education and Disparities in Diagnosis and Treatment.', 'Evolving Natural History of Metastatic Prostate Cancer.', 'Assessment of Clinician Decision-making on Cancer Screening Cessation in Older Adults With Limited Life Expectancy.']"""

Materials and methods:   Patients with IR PCa treated with IMRT at our institution between September 2000 and November 2010 were analyzed retrospectively. The treatment consisted of IMRT (70-78 Gy in 35-39 fractions) combined with 6 months of neoadjuvant ADT. Salvage ADT was initiated when the prostate-specific antigen level was > 4.0 ng/mL RESULTS: In total, 106 consecutive patients with IR PCa (median age: 70 years old) were analyzed. The median follow-up period was 8.0 years. The overall survival, PCa-specific survival, biochemical failure, and clinical failure rates were 99.0%, 100.0%, 6.8%, and 1.9% at 5 years and 89.1%, 100.0%, 11.3%, and 2.9% at 10 years, respectively. Late recurrence (> 5 years) was observed in three cases (2.8%). The cumulative incidence rates of genitourinary (GU) and gastrointestinal (GI) toxicities (grade 2/3) were 10.5% and 5.8% at 5 years, and 14.7% and 5.8% at 10 years, respectively. No patient developed grade 4/5 GU toxicities or grade 3-5 GI toxicities.  Conclusion:   IMRT at a dose up to 78 Gy combined with short-term neoadjuvant ADT resulted in excellent long-term disease-free outcomes with acceptable morbidities among patients with IR PCa.

Also, especially in men, androgen has beneficial effects on bone independent of estrogen. However, estrogen replacement therapy for postmenopausal women increases the risk of developing breast cancer and endometrial cancer, and androgen replacement therapy for partial androgen deficiency of the aging male increases the risk of developing prostate cancer. Various mechanisms have been proposed on the effects of gonadal hormones on bone, such as effects through cytokines including IL-6 and effects on the OPG/RANKL ratio. In addition, large amounts of new information deriving from high-throughput gene expression analysis raise the possibility of multiple other effects on bone cells. Both estrogen and androgen exert their effects via the estrogen receptor (ER) or the androgen receptor (AR), which belongs to the nuclear receptor superfamily. Compounds such as selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) and selective androgen receptor modulators (SARMs) also bind ER and AR, respectively. However, SERMs and SARMs alter the ER or AR structure differently from estrogen or androgen, resulting in other downstream gene responses. As a result they can exert favorable effects on bone while suppressing the undesirable actions of estrogen and androgen. Elucidation of ER and AR ligand-specific and tissue-specific gene regulation mechanisms will also provide information on the signal transduction mechanisms of other nuclear receptors and will be valuable for the development of new therapeutic agents.""","""['Tomohiko Yoshida', 'Jun Wang', 'Paula H Stern']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Handb Exp Pharmacol""","""['New selective estrogen and androgen receptor modulators.', 'Modulators of androgen and estrogen receptor activity.', 'SERMs and SARMs: detection of their activities with yeast based bioassays.', 'Selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs): mechanisms of anticarcinogenesis and drug resistance.', 'Molecular mechanisms of estrogen action: selective ligands and receptor pharmacology.', 'Biological Deciphering of the ""Kidney Governing Bones"" Theory in Traditional Chinese Medicine.', 'Poor bone matrix quality: What can be done about it?']"""

After ligand binding, AR is recruited to the androgen responsive element (ARE) sequences on the DNA where AR interaction with coactivators and corepressors modulates transcription. We demonstrated that phosphorylation of AR at Tyr-267 by Ack1/TNK2 tyrosine kinase results in nuclear translocation, DNA binding, and androgen-dependent gene transcription in a low androgen environment. In order to dissect downstream mechanisms, we searched for proteins whose interaction with AR was regulated by Ack1. SLIRP (SRA stem-loop interacting RNA binding protein) was identified as a candidate protein. Interaction between AR and SLIRP was disrupted by Ack1 kinase activity as well as androgen or heregulin treatment. The noncoding RNA, SRA, was required for AR-SLIRP interaction. SLIRP was bound to ARE's of AR target genes in the absence of androgen. Treatment with androgen or heregulin led to dissociation of SLIRP from the ARE. Whole transcriptome analysis of SLIRP knockdown in androgen responsive LNCaP cells showed that SLIRP affects a significant subset of androgen-regulated genes.

In prostate cancer (PCa), bone metastasis can occur years after prostatectomy, suggesting that bone may provide dormancy-inducing factors. To search for these factors, we prepared conditioned media (CM) from calvariae. Using live-cell imaging, we found that Calvarial-CM treatment increased cellular quiescence in C4-2B4 PCa cells. Mass spectrometry analysis of Calvarial-CM identified 132 secreted factors. Western blot and ELISA analyses confirmed the presence of several factors, including DKK3, BMP1, neogenin and vasorin in the Calvarial-CM. qRT-PCR analysis of total calvariae versus isolated osteoblasts showed that DKK3, BMP1, vasorin and neogenin are mainly expressed by osteoblasts, while MIA, LECT1, NGAL and PEDF are expressed by other calvarial cells. Recombinant human DKK3, BMP1, vasorin, neogenin, MIA and NGAL treatment increased cellular quiescence in both C4-2b and C4-2B4 PCa cells. Mechanistically, DKK3, vasorin and neogenin, but not BMP1, increased dormancy through activating the p38MAPK signaling pathway. Consistently, DKK3, vasorin and neogenin failed to induce dormancy in cells expressing dominant-negative p38αMAPK while BMP1 remained active, suggesting that BMP1 uses an alternative dormancy signaling pathway. Thus, bone secretes multiple dormancy-inducing factors that employ distinct signaling pathways to induce DTC dormancy in bone.""","""['Li-Yuan Yu-Lee', 'Yu-Chen Lee', 'Jing Pan', 'Song-Chang Lin', 'Tianhong Pan', 'Guoyu Yu', 'David H Hawke', 'Bih-Fang Pan', 'Sue-Hwa Lin']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Sci Rep""","""['Osteoblast-Secreted Factors Mediate Dormancy of Metastatic Prostate Cancer in the Bone via Activation of the TGFβRIII-p38MAPK-pS249/T252RB Pathway.', 'Secreted Protein Acidic and Rich in Cysteine (SPARC) Mediates Metastatic Dormancy of Prostate Cancer in Bone.', 'Osteoblasts produce soluble factors that induce a gene expression pattern in non-metastatic prostate cancer cells, similar to that found in bone metastatic prostate cancer cells.', 'The biology and clinical implications of prostate cancer dormancy and metastasis.', 'Tumour dormancy in inflammatory microenvironment: A promising therapeutic strategy for cancer-related bone metastasis.', 'SNHG1 opposes quiescence and promotes docetaxel sensitivity in prostate cancer.', 'A Drosophila chemical screen reveals synergistic effect of MEK and DGKα inhibition in Ras-driven cancer.', 'Osteoblasts and osteoclasts: an important switch of tumour cell dormancy during bone metastasis.', 'Targeted Anti-Mitochondrial Therapy: The Future of Oncology.', 'Review old bone, new tricks.']"""

However, the biological consequences of these abnormalities in these disease processes remain largely unknown. Here, we investigated the aberrant activation of HGF/MET and Wnt/β-catenin cascades in prostate tumorigenesis by using a newly generated mouse model in which both murine Met transgene and stabilized β-catenin are conditionally co-expressed in prostatic epithelial cells. These compound mice displayed accelerated prostate tumor formation and invasion compared with their littermates that expressed only stabilized β-catenin. RNA-Seq and quantitative RT-PCR analyses revealed increased expression of genes associated with tumor cell proliferation, progression, and metastasis. Moreover, Wnt signaling pathways were robustly enriched in prostate tumor samples from the compound mice. ChIP-qPCR experiments revealed increased β-catenin recruitment within the regulatory regions of the Myc gene in tumor cells of the compound mice. Interestingly, the occupancy of MET on the Myc promoter also appeared in the compound mouse tumor samples, implicating a novel role of MET in β-catenin-mediated transcription. Results from implanting prostate graft tissues derived from the compound mice and controls into HGF-transgenic mice further uncovered that HGF induces prostatic oncogenic transformation and cell growth.

The growth of PCa cells is stirred up by androgens and androgen receptor (AR). Therefore, therapeutic strategies such as blocking androgens synthesis and inhibiting AR binding have been explored in recent years. However, recently approved drugs (or in clinical phase) failed in improving the expected survival rates for this metastatic-castration resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) patients. The selective CYP17A1 inhibition of 17,20-lyase route has emerged as a novel strategy. Such inhibition blocks the production of androgens everywhere they are found in the body. In this work, a three dimensional-quantitative structure activity relationship (3D-QSAR) pharmacophore model is developed on a diverse set of non-steroidal inhibitors of CYP17A1 enzyme. Highly active compounds are selected to define a six-point pharmacophore hypothesis with a unique geometrical arrangement fitting the following description: two hydrogen bond acceptors (A), two hydrogen bond donors (D) and two aromatic rings (R). The QSAR model showed adequate predictive statistics. The 3D-QSAR model is further used for database virtual screening of potential inhibitory hit structures. Density functional theory (DFT) optimization provides the electronic properties explaining the reactivity of the hits. Docking simulations discovers hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions as responsible for the binding affinities of hits to the CYP17A1 Protein Data Bank structure. 13 hits from the database search (including five derivatives) are then synthesized in the laboratory as different scaffolds. Ultra high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS) in vitro experiments reveals three new chemical entities (NCEs) with half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) values against the lyase route at mid-micromolar range with favorable selectivity to the lyase over the hydroxylase route (one of them with null hydroxylase inhibition).

TiONts were synthesized by a hydrothermal process. To develop the customengineered nanohybrids, the surface of TiONts was coated beforehand with a siloxane (APTES), and coupled with both dithiolated diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acidmodified gold nanoparticles (Au@DTDTPA NPs) and a heterobifunctional polymer (PEG3000) to significantly improve suspension stability and biocompatibility of TiONts for targeted biomedical applications. The prefunctionalized surface of this scaffold had reactive sites to graft therapeutic agents, such as docetaxel (DTX). This novel combination, aimed at retaining the AuNPs inside the tumor via TiONts, was able to enhance the radiation effect. Nanohybrids have been extensively characterized and were detectable by SPECT/CT imaging through grafted Au@DTDTPA NPs, radiolabeled with 111In. In vitro results showed that TiONtsAuNPsPEG3000DTX had a substantial cytotoxic activity on human PC3 prostate adenocarcinoma cells, unlike initial nanohybrids without DTX (Au@DTDTPA NPs and TiONtsAuNPsPEG3000).

These compounds, derived from a second-generation PS, exhibit absorption at long wavelengths; considerable singlet oxygen generation and, in contrast to purpurin 18, have higher hydrophilicity due to decreased logP. Together, these properties make them potentially ideal PSs. To verify this, we screened the developed compounds for cell uptake, intracellular localization, antitumor activity and induced cell death type. All of the tested compounds were taken up into cancer cells of various origin and localized in organelles known to be important PDT targets, specifically, mitochondria and the endoplasmic reticulum. The incorporation of a zinc ion and PEGylation significantly enhanced the photosensitizing efficacy, decreasing IC50 (half maximal inhibitory compound concentration) in HeLa cells by up to 170 times compared with the parental purpurin 18.

Standard therapy for advanced disease consists of anti-androgens, however, almost all prostate tumors become castration resistant (CRPC). Progression from androgen-sensitive PCa to CRPC is promoted by inflammatory signaling through cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression and ErbB family receptors/AKT activation, compensating androgen receptor inactivity.  Methods:   Making use of CRPC cell lines, we investigated the effects of the anti-inflammatory drug celecoxib. Biochemical data obtained using immunoblotting, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), invasion, and xenografts were further integrated by bioinformatic analyses.  Results:   Celecoxib reduced cell growth and induced apoptosis through AKT blockade, cleavage of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1), and proteasomal degradation of the anti-apoptotic protein Mcl-1. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), ErbB2, and ErbB3 degradation, and heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K (hnRNP K) downregulation, further amplified the inhibition of androgen signaling. Celecoxib reduced the invasive phenotype of CRPC cells by modulating NF-κB activity and reduced tumor growth in mice xenografts when administered in association with the anti-EGFR receptor antibody cetuximab. Bioinformatic analyses on human prostate cancer datasets support the relevance of these pathways in PCa progression.  Conclusions:   Signaling nodes at the intersection of pathways implicated in PCa progression are simultaneously modulated by celecoxib treatment. In combination therapies with cetuximab, celecoxib could represent a novel therapeutic strategy to curb signal transduction during CRPC progression.""","""['Roberto Benelli', 'Paola Barboro', 'Delfina Costa', 'Simonetta Astigiano', 'Ottavia Barbieri', 'Matteo Capaia', 'Alessandro Poggi', 'Nicoletta Ferrari']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Int J Mol Sci""","""['The ErbB family and androgen receptor signaling are targets of\xa0Celecoxib in prostate cancer.', 'Combination of carmustine and selenite effectively inhibits tumor growth by targeting androgen receptor, androgen receptor-variants, and Akt in preclinical models: New hope for patients with castration resistant prostate cancer.', 'ErbB2 Signaling Increases Androgen Receptor Expression in Abiraterone-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Interference with the androgen receptor protein stability in therapy-resistant prostate cancer.', 'NF-κB signaling promotes castration-resistant prostate cancer initiation and progression.', 'Cooperation between Prostaglandin E2 and Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor in Cancer Progression: A Dual Target for Cancer Therapy.', 'NSAIDs and Cancer Resolution: New Paradigms beyond Cyclooxygenase.', 'Application of Anti-Inflammatory Agents in Prostate Cancer.']"""

Methods:   We validated bioinformatics analyses of publicly available databases by staining human TNBC. After virally overexpressing or siRNA-reducing SLFN12 in TNBC cell lines, we measured proliferation by CCK-8 assay, invasion into basement-membrane-coated pores, mRNA by q-RT-PCR and protein by Western blotting. Flow cytometry assessed proliferation and stem cell marker expression, and sorted CD44+/CD24- cells. Stemness was also assessed by mammosphere formation, and translation by click-it-AHA chemistry.  Results:   SLFN12 expression was lower in TNBC tumors and correlated with survival. SLFN12 overexpression reduced TNBC MDA-MB-231, BT549, and Hs578T proliferation. In MDA-MB-231 cells, AdSLFN12 reduced invasion, promoted cell cycle arrest, increased E-cadherin promoter activity, mRNA, and protein, and reduced vimentin expression and protein. SLFN12 knockdown increased vimentin. AdSLFN12 reduced the proportion of MDA-MB-231 CD44+CD24- cells, with parallel differentiation changes. SLFN12 overexpression reduced MDA-MB-231 mammosphere formation. SLFN12 overexpression decreased ZEB1 and Slug protein despite increased ZEB1 and Slug mRNA in all three lines.

Materials and methods:   We included 1345 patients consecutively operated by radical prostatectomy (RP) since 2014, when MRI and TB were introduced in the diagnostic pathway. Patients underwent systematic biopsy (SB) only (n = 819) or SB and TB (n = 526) prior to RP during the same time period. Pathological and biochemical outcomes were compared between PCa men undergoing SB (SB cohort) and a combination of TB and SB (TB cohort). Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression models were used to assess biochemical recurrence-free survival (RFS).  Results:   Both cohorts were comparable regarding final pathology and RFS (p = 0.538). The EAU risk classification accurately predicted outcomes in SB cohort, but did not significantly separate low from intermediate risk in TB cohort (p = 0.791). In TB cohort, the new proposed three-group risk classification significantly improved the recurrence risk prediction compared with the EAU risk classification: HR 4 (versus HR 1.2, p = 0.009) for intermediate, and HR 15 (versus HR 6.5, p < 0.001) in high-risk groups, respectively.

Here, we demonstrate increased levels of dynamin-related protein 1 (DRP1), a mitochondrial fission mediator, in androgen-sensitive and castration-resistant AR-driven PCa. AR signaling upregulates DRP1 to form the VDAC-MPC2 complex, increases pyruvate transport into mitochondria, and supports mitochondrial metabolism, including oxidative phosphorylation and lipogenesis. DRP1 inhibition activates the cellular metabolic stress response, which involves AMPK phosphorylation, induction of autophagy, and the ER unfolded protein response, and attenuates androgen-induced proliferation. Additionally, DRP1 expression facilitates PCa cell survival under diverse metabolic stress conditions, including hypoxia and oxidative stress. Moreover, we found that increased DRP1 expression was indicative of poor prognosis in patients with castration-resistant PCa. Collectively, our findings link androgen signaling-mediated mitochondrial dynamics to metabolic reprogramming; moreover, they have important implications for understanding PCa progression.""","""['Yu Geon Lee', 'Yeji Nam', 'Kyeong Jin Shin', 'Sora Yoon', 'Weon Seo Park', 'Jae Young Joung', 'Jeong Kon Seo', 'Jinho Jang', 'Semin Lee', 'Dougu Nam', 'M Cecilia Caino', 'Pann-Ghill Suh', 'Young Chan Chae']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Cancer Lett""","""['Novel role of androgens in mitochondrial fission and apoptosis.', 'Mitochondrial pyruvate import is a metabolic vulnerability in androgen receptor-driven prostate cancer.', 'Pharmacological inhibition of androgen receptor expression induces cell death in prostate cancer cells.', 'Androgen receptors in hormone-dependent and castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Oxidative stress and androgen receptor signaling in the development and progression of castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Mitochondrial Alterations in Prostate Cancer: Roles in Pathobiology and Racial Disparities.', 'Unraveling the Peculiar Features of Mitochondrial Metabolism and Dynamics in Prostate Cancer.', 'Molecular Mechanisms of Noncoding RNA in the Occurrence of Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Emerging Hallmarks of Metabolic Reprogramming in Prostate Cancer.', 'Association of mitochondrial homeostasis and dynamic balance with malignant biological behaviors of gastrointestinal cancer.']"""

Methods:   We included 627 patients who were assessed for pre- and postimplant potency between 2005 and 2017. Assessment was based on the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events Scale (CTCAEs). Logistic regression models were used to assess clinical predictors of preserved potency after PB defined as having sufficient erections for sexual activity with or without the need of oral pharmacologic assistance. Covariates included age, diabetes (DM), hypertension (HTN), dyslipidemia (DLP), coronary artery disease (CAD), International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS), prostate volume, and Cancer of the Prostate Risk Assessments (CAPRA) score. Patients on androgen deprivation therapy or using five alpha reductase inhibitors were excluded from analyses.  Results:   Post-PB potency was assessed at an average of 6 months (n = 627), 1 year (n = 538), 2 years (=440), 4 years (n = 272), and 5 years (n = 124). At 2 and 5 years, post-PB potency was preserved in 87% and 84% of patients, respectively. When adjusting for all available covariates, advanced age, pre-PB potency, and the presence of vascular comorbidities (HTN, DM, and DLP) were all predictors of potency at 2 years after PB (all p < 0.01). When performing a sensitivity analysis for vascular comorbidities, the presence of DM had the strongest impact on ED than either HTN or DLP (p < 0.01).  Conclusion:   More than 84% of patients had preserved potency 5 years after PB. Advanced age, pre-PB potency, and vascular comorbidities had a statistically significant impact on potency after PB.""","""['Amélie Bazinet', 'Kevin C Zorn', 'Daniel Taussky', 'Guila Delouya', 'Daniel Liberman']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Brachytherapy""","""['Erectile function after permanent prostate brachytherapy.', 'Erectile function after prostate brachytherapy.', 'Long-term potency preservation following brachytherapy for prostate cancer.', 'Nursing considerations in brachytherapy-related erectile dysfunction.', 'The Natural History of Erectile Dysfunction After Prostatic Radiotherapy: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.']"""

Methods:   Medical records of patients treated from 2009 to 2012, to assess medium-term oncologic outcomes, were reviewed. Prostate biopsies were performed in local recurrence suspicion (biochemical failure, MR follow-up failure).  Results:   Among 18 patients, mean age of 72.6 (61-78), 2 (11 %) and 7 (38.9 %) biological and reported biopsy-proven local recurrence respectively with our initial technic of CA.

A previous treatment of prostate cancer (P=0.5), pre-treatment PSA (P=0.2), pre-treatment Gleason/ISUP score (P=0.4), nadir PSA post-CA (P=0.22) were not associated with recurrence. Bilateral positive cores appears as a pejorative predictive factor (P=0.04).

This post hoc analysis of 3 large trials for men with mCRPC examined the influence of the type of progression at initiation of first-line chemotherapy, as well as the type of progression during treatment, on treatment outcomes.  Methods:   Data from the phase III studies VENICE (n = 1224), TAX327 (n = 1006) and FIRSTANA (n = 1168) were used as independent data sets. Type of progression was defined as follows: prostate-specific antigen (PSA) only (group 1), radiological (±PSA) (group 2) or pain (±PSA, ± radiological) progression (group 3). The impact of baseline type of progression on overall survival (OS) was evaluated in multivariate Cox regression analysis with backward elimination, stratified for the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance score and treatment arm.  Results:   The median OS (arms combined) from treatment initiation in VENICE was 28.6, 26.3 and 16.9 months for G1, G2 and G3, respectively (hazard ratio: 1.14 [95% confidence interval {CI}: 0.92-1.41%] in G2 and 2.13 [95% CI: 1.75-2.59%] in G3 compared with G1). Multivariate analysis (arms combined) showed that pain progression at baseline was an independent predictor of poor OS. Similar findings were observed in the TAX327 and FIRSTANA data sets. During treatment, pain or radiological progression preceded PSA progression in ~55% of the patients. The retrospective characteristic of this study is a limitation.  Conclusions:   The type of progression at baseline strongly predicts OS in men with mCRPC treated with first-line chemotherapy. During treatment, pain and/or radiological progression preceded PSA progression as the first progression event in ~55% of the patients. This finding has the prospect to be incorporated in clinical guidelines and to be practice changing because it implies the need for regular imaging and not to rely on PSA progression alone.""","""['Debbie G Robbrecht', 'Nicolas Delanoy', 'Ian F Tannock', 'Bertrand Tombal', 'Mario Eisenberger', 'Karim Fizazi', 'Oliver Sartor', 'Florence Mercier', 'Stephane Oudard', 'Ronald de Wit']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Eur J Cancer""","""['Pain Progression at Initiation of Cabazitaxel in Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer (mCRPC): A Post Hoc Analysis of the PROSELICA Study.', 'The Phase 3 COU-AA-302 Study of Abiraterone Acetate Plus Prednisone in Men with Chemotherapy-naïve Metastatic Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer: Stratified Analysis Based on Pain, Prostate-specific Antigen, and Gleason Score.', 'Prediction of survival following first-line chemotherapy in men with castration-resistant metastatic prostate cancer.', 'Association of early PSA decline and time to PSA progression in abiraterone acetate-treated metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer; a post-hoc analysis of Japanese phase 2 trials.', 'Current vaccination strategies for prostate cancer.', 'Pain Progression at Initiation of Cabazitaxel in Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer (mCRPC): A Post Hoc Analysis of the PROSELICA Study.', 'FDA Approval Summary: Rucaparib for the Treatment of Patients with Deleterious BRCA-Mutated Metastatic Castrate-Resistant Prostate Cancer.']"""

Functional inactivation of GSTP1 increases the susceptibility to oxidative stress and enhance progression risk of the prostatic carcinoma. In this study, we hypothesized that the Piwi-interacting RNA (piRNA) could be a sequence-recognition and guidance molecule for induction of promoter methylation of GSTP1 facilitating prostate carcinogenesis. We found that piR-31470 was highly expressed in prostate cancer cells, and piR-31470 could bind to piwi-like RNA-mediated gene silencing 4 (PIWIL4) to form the PIWIL4/piR-31470 complex. This complex could bind to the nascent RNA transcripts of GSTP1, and recruit DNA methyltransferase 1, DNA methyltransferase 3 alpha and methyl-CpG binding domain protein 2 to initiate and maintain the hypermethylation and inactivation of GSTP1. Our data demonstrated that the overexpression of piR-31470 inhibited the levels of GSTP1 and increased vulnerability to oxidative stress and DNA damage in human prostate epithelial RWPE1 cells. In conclusion, this study characterized the roles of the PIWIL4/piR-31470 complex in the regulation of the transcription of GSTP1 by methylating the CpG island of GSTP1.

By contrast, androgen-insensitive PC3 and DU145 cells displayed clear nuclear hASH1 localisation under control conditions that was unchanged by AD, suggesting AR signalling negatively regulated hASH1 expression and localisation. Synthetic androgen (R1881) prevented NE transdifferentiation of AD LNCaP cells and markedly suppressed expression of key regulators of lineage commitment and neurogenesis (REST and ASCL1/hASH1). Post-AD, NE LNCaP cells rapidly lost NE-like morphology following R1881 treatment, yet ASCL1/hASH1 expression was resistant to R1881 treatment and hASH1 nuclear localisation remained evident in apparently dedifferentiated LNCaP cells. Consequently, NE cells may not fully revert to an epithelial state and retain key NE-like features, suggesting a ""hybrid"" phenotype.

Here, we assessed the biodistribution and image quality of 18F-rhPSMA-7 to determine the best imaging time point for patients with prostate cancer. Methods: In total, 202 prostate cancer patients who underwent a clinically indicated 18F-rhPSMA-7 PET/CT were retrospectively analyzed, and 12 groups based on the administered activity and uptake time of PET scanning were created: 3 administered activities (low, 222-296 MBq; moderate, 297-370 MBq; and high, 371-444 MBq) and 4 uptake time points (short, 50-70 min; intermediate, 71-90 min; long, 91-110 min; and extra long, ≥111 min). For quantitative analyses, SUVmean and organ- or tumor-to-background ratio were determined for background, healthy organs, and 3 representative tumor lesions. Qualitative analyses assessed overall image quality, nonspecific blood-pool activity, and background uptake in bone or marrow using 3- or 4-point scales. Results: In quantitative analyses, SUVmean showed a significant decrease in the blood pool and lungs and an increase in the kidneys, bladder, and bones as the uptake time increased. SUVmean showed a trend to increase in the blood pool and bones as the administered activity increased. However, no significant differences were found in 377 tumor lesions with respect to the administered activity or uptake time. In qualitative analyses, the overall image quality was stable along with the uptake time, but the proportion rated to have good image quality decreased as the administered activity increased. All other qualitative image parameters showed no significant differences for the administered activities, but they showed significant trends with increasing uptake time: less nonspecific blood activity, more frequent background uptake in the bone marrow, and increased negative impact on clinical decision making. Conclusion: The biodistribution of 18F-rhPSMA-7 was similar to that of established PSMA ligands, and tumor uptake of 18F-rhPSMA-7 was stable across the administered activities and uptake times.

They are associated with longer half-lives, larger-scale production, and lower positron range than their 68Ga-labeled counterparts. Here, we describe the efficacy of an 18F-labeled radiohybrid PSMA, rhPSMA-7, a novel theranostic PSMA-targeting agent for imaging BCR of prostate cancer. Methods: Datasets from 261 consecutive patients with noncastrate BCR after radical prostatectomy who underwent 18F-rhPSMA-7 PET/CT at our institution between June 2017 and March 2018 were reviewed retrospectively. All lesions suspected of being recurrent prostate cancer were recorded. The detection rate for sites of presumed recurrence was correlated with patients' prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level, primary Gleason score, and prior therapy (androgen deprivation therapy and external-beam radiation therapy). Results: The 261 patients had a median PSA level of 0.96 ng/mL (range, 0.01-400 ng/mL). The median injected activity of 18F-rhPSMA-7 was 336 MBq, with a median uptake time of 76 min. In total, 211 patients (81%) showed pathologic findings on 18F-rhPSMA-7 PET/CT.

In 32% patients (7/22) with a PSA of less than 0.2 ng/mL, suggestive lesions were present. 18F-rhPSMA-7 PET/CT revealed local recurrence in 43% of patients (113). Lymph node metastases were present in the pelvis in 42% of patients (110), in the retroperitoneum in 17% (45), and in a supradiaphragmatic location in 8.0% (21).

Here, we present data from a retrospective analysis using PET/CT and PET/MRI examinations to investigate the efficacy of 18F-rhPSMA-7 PET for primary N-staging of patients with prostate cancer (PC) compared with morphologic imaging (CT or MRI) and validated by histopathology. Methods: Data from 58 patients with high-risk PC (according to the D'Amico criteria) who were staged with 18F-rhPSMA-7 PET/CT or PET/MRI at our institution between July 2017 and June 2018 were reviewed. The patients had a median prescan prostate-specific antigen value of 12.2 ng/mL (range, 1.2-81.6 ng/mL). The median injected activity of 18F-rhPSMA-7 was 327 MBq (range, 132-410 MBq), with a median uptake time of 79.5 min (range, 60-153 min). All patients underwent subsequent radical prostatectomy and extended pelvic lymph node dissection. The presence of lymph node metastases was determined by an experienced reader independently for both the PET and the morphologic datasets using a template-based analysis on a 5-point scale. Patient-level and template-based results were both compared with histopathologic findings. Results: Lymph node metastases were present in 18 patients (31.0%) and were located in 52 of 375 templates (13.9%). Receiver-operating-characteristic analyses showed 18F-rhPSMA-7 PET to perform significantly better than morphologic imaging on both patient-based and template-based analyses (areas under curve, 0.858 vs. 0.649 [P = 0.012] and 0.765 vs. 0.589 [P < 0.001], respectively). On patient-based analyses, the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of 18F-rhPSMA-7 PET were 72.2%, 92.5%, and 86.2%, respectively, and those of morphologic imaging were 50.0%, 72.5%, and 65.5%, respectively. On template-based analyses, the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of 18F-rhPSMA-7 PET were 53.8%, 96.9%, and 90.9%, respectively, and those of morphologic imaging were 9.6%, 95.0%, and 83.2%, respectively.

In general, therapies for localized PCa are curative. However, treatment of advanced PCa is considered palliative since development of therapy resistance occurs rapidly. It has been shown that tumor-initiating cells are likely involved in therapy resistance. They are not eliminated by conventional therapies and thereby lead to tumor progression and relapse. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of the known stem cell inhibitor salinomycin on this critical subpopulation of cells.  Methods:   Expression of the cell surface markers CD24 and CD44 was assessed by immunofluorescence and fluorescence-activated cell sorting. Colony formation efficiency and classification of colony types with varying tumor-initiating potential (holoclones, meroclones, and paraclones) were analyzed in an automated way by the newly developed CATCH-colonies software in the absence or presence of salinomycin.  Results:   Automated high-resolution colony formation analysis consistently identified the various colony types in a broad range of PCa cell lines. Serial clonogenic assays confirmed that holoclones show the highest colony formation potential and maintain their tumor-initiating capacity over multiple rounds. Furthermore, holoclones showed high expression of CD44, while CD24 was not expressed in these clones, thus representing the well-described tumor-initiating CD24- /CD44high population. Salinomycin decreased the CD24- /CD44high population in both docetaxel-sensitive PC3 and docetaxel-resistant (DR) PC3-DR. Moreover, treatment of PC3, DU145, PC3-DR, and DU145-DR with salinomycin led to a significant reduction in the colony formation potential by targeting the colonies with high tumor-initiating potential.  Conclusions:   Taken together, we demonstrated that salinomycin specifically targets the tumor-initiating cell population in docetaxel-sensitive and docetaxel-resistant PCa cells and may represent a potential therapeutic approach for the treatment of advanced PCa.""","""['Martina Gruber', 'Florian Handle', 'Zoran Culig']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Combined targeting of EGFR and HER2 against prostate cancer stem cells.', 'Synergistic antitumor interaction of valproic acid and simvastatin sensitizes prostate cancer to docetaxel by targeting CSCs compartment via YAP inhibition.', 'Codelivery of salinomycin and docetaxel using poly(D,L-lactic-co-glycolic acid)-poly(ethylene glycol) nanoparticles to target both gastric cancer cells and cancer stem cells.', 'Prostate cancer stem cells: a new target for therapy.', 'The role of cancer stem cells in breast cancer initiation and progression: potential cancer stem cell-directed therapies.', 'Celecoxib, a Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drug, Exerts a Toxic Effect on Human Melanoma Cells Grown as 2D and 3D Cell Cultures.', 'The synergistic anticancer effect of salinomycin combined with cabazitaxel in CD44+ prostate cancer cells by downregulating wnt, NF-κB and AKT signaling.', 'Molecular mechanisms of docetaxel resistance in prostate cancer.', 'Schisandrin\xa0B suppresses osteosarcoma lung metastasis in\xa0vivo by inhibiting the activation of the Wnt/β‑catenin and PI3K/Akt signaling pathways.', 'Oxidative Damage Induced by Phototoxic Pheophorbide a 17-Diethylene Glycol Ester Encapsulated in PLGA Nanoparticles.']"""

However, reading prostatectomy histopathology slides, which is basically for staging, is usually time consuming and differs from reading small biopsy specimens, which is mainly used for diagnosis. Generally, each prostatectomy specimen generates tens of large tissue sections and for each section, the malignant region needs to be delineated to assess the amount of tumor and its burden. With the aim of reducing the workload of pathologists, in this study, we focus on developing a computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) system based on a densely connected convolutional neural network (DenseNet) for whole-slide histopathology images to outline the malignant regions.  Methods:   We use an efficient color normalization process based on ranklet transformation to automatically correct the intensity of the images. Additionally, we use spatial probability to segment the tissue structure regions for different tissue recognition patterns. Based on the segmentation, we incorporate a multidimensional structure into DenseNet to determine if a particular prostatic region is benign or malignant.  Results:   As demonstrated by the experimental results with a test set of 2,663 images from 32 whole-slide prostate histopathology images, our proposed system achieved 0.726, 0.6306, and 0.5209 in the average of the Dice coefficient, Jaccard similarity coefficient, and Boundary F1 score measures, respectively.

Methods:   From January 2013 to December 2018 patients older than 18 years, who provided signed consent and underwent open or robot assisted radical prostatectomy were enrolled and retrospectively evaluated. Patients who underwent any previous prostate cancer (PCA) treatments were excluded. Specifically, skilled and experienced surgeons performed the two surgical approaches. Patients were followed for complications and hospital readmission (RAD) for a period of six months. The association of factors with the risk of readmission was assessed by Cox's multivariate proportional hazards.  Results:   A total of 1062 patients underwent RP. RARP was performed in 891 cases and ORP in 171 subjects. Extended pelvic lymph node dissection (ePLND) was performed in 651 patients. Hospital readmission occurred in 53 cases (5%). Based on the final multivariate model, independent factors associated with the risk of hospital readmission were seminal vesicle invasion (HR=2.093; 95% CI: 1.177-3.722), ORP (HR=4.393; 95% CI: 2.516-7.672) and ePLND (HR=4.418; 95% CI: 1.544-12.639).

An increase of androgen expression and androgen receptors has a positive effect on oncogenic expression. We aimed to evaluate whether 5-alpha reductase inhibitors (5-ARI) have a role in NMIBC.  Methods:   We retrospectively evaluated the clinical and pathological data of 423 patients with NMIBC who underwent transurethral bladder resection. We considered the number of resections, number of total recurrences, time of recurrences, and histopathology details. The population was classified into two groups: treated and untreated with 5-ARIs. The enrolled patients were in treatment with 5ARIs for symptomatic prostatic hyperplasia for at least 12 months. Mean follow-up time was 30.43 months.  Results:   Patients treated with 5-ARIs had a lower rate of recurrence (14%) than the untreated group (37%). There was a significant difference in the mean number of recurrences between the untreated and the treated group (P=0.006). Furthermore, the treated group showed a significantly greater number of low than high grade tumors, compared to the untreated group (P≤0.05). There was a significant decrease in the number of muscle invasive tumors in treated patients (P=0.032). The recurrence-free survival rate of patients treated with 5-ARIs was significantly higher (P=0.0001).

Therefore, finding key molecules that interact with AR as novel strategies to treat prostate cancer and even CRPC is desperately needed. In the current study, we focused on the regulation of RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) associated with AR and determined that the mRNA and protein levels of AR were highly correlated with Musashi2 (MSI2) levels. MSI2 was upregulated in prostate cancer specimens and significantly correlated with advanced tumor grades. Downregulation of MSI2 in both androgen sensitive and insensitive prostate cancer cells inhibited tumor formation in vivo and decreased cell growth in vitro, which could be reversed by AR overexpression. Mechanistically, MSI2 directly bound to the 3'-untranslated region (UTR) of AR mRNA to increase its stability and, thus, enhanced its transcriptional activity.

The correlation between altered production of the main steroids and prostate carcinoma (PCa) occurrence is historically known. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the modifications of a comprehensive urinary endogenous steroidal profile (USP) induced by PCa, by multivariate statistical methods.  Methods:   A total of 283 Italian subjects were included in the study, 139 controls and 144 PCa-affected patients. The USP, including 17 steroids and five urinary steroidal ratios, was quantitatively evaluated using gas chromatography coupled with single quadrupole mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The data were interpreted using a chemometric, multivariate approach (intrinsically more sensible to alterations with respect to traditional statistics) and a model for the discrimination of cancer-affected profiles was built.  Results:   Two multivariate classification models were calculated, the former including three steroids with the highest statistical significance (e.g. testosterone, etiocholanolone and 7β-OH-DHEA) and PSA values, the latter considering the three steroids' levels only. Both models yielded high sensitivity and specificity scores near to 70%, resulting significantly higher than PSA alone.

All patients received initial androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT). After progression to CRPC, they received docetaxel or ARAT (abiraterone or enzalutamide) as first-line life-prolonging therapy. Docetaxel (70-75 mg/m2 ) every 3 weeks vs enzalutamide (160 mg) once daily orally or abiraterone (1 g) once daily plus prednisone (5 mg) twice daily orally was administered. The primary outcome of interest was overall survival (OS) from the time of CRPC diagnosis. A propensity score analysis with a 1:1 ratio using an optimal matching algorithm was used to adjust for confounding factors.  Results:   Overall, 234 patients were analysed. Propensity score-matching identified 85 patients in each group. There were no significant differences in patient characteristics between the groups. The median OS in the docetaxel group was 38.2 vs 58.3 months in the ARAT group (P = 0.03). For patients with IDC-P, OS was significantly longer in the ARAT group than the docetaxel group (P = 0.01), and there was no significant difference in each group, as in patients without IDC-P (P = 0.67). A multivariate analysis showed that the presence of IDC-P, duration of primary ADT, visceral metastasis, and administration of ARAT as the first-line treatment for CRPC were independent prognostic factors for OS.

MicroRNA-7-5p (miR-7-5p) has been demonstrated to be a tumor suppressor in breast cancer, hepatocarcinoma, prostate cancer and glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). However, its role in NSCLC is still not fully understood. This study evaluated the role of miR-7-5p in the progression of NSCLC and explored the underlying mechanism.  Materials & methods:   The quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR), MTT, migration and invasion assays were used to evaluate the effects of miR-7-5p on the proliferation, migration and invasion of A549 and SPCA-1 cells. A tumor xenograft model was created to determine the effects of miR-7-5p on metastasis in vivo. The dual-luciferase reporter gene, neuro-oncological ventral antigen 2 (NOVA2) overexpression and western blotting assays were performed to explore the underlying mechanism.  Results:   MiR-7-5p is downregulated in NSCLC tissues and lung cancer cell lines. It suppresses proliferation, migration, invasion and EMT marker expression in vitro and in vivo. Further study showed that miR-7-5p suppresses tumor metastasis of NSCLC by targeting NOVA2. Overexpression of NOVA2 attenuates the miR-7-5p-mediated inhibitory effect on lung cancer cells.

Recently, long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) prostate cancer gene expression marker 1 (PCGEM1) has been demonstrated to involve in the initiation and progression of human cancers. However, to date, the clinical and functional significance of PCGEM1 expression in CC progression remains unknown.  Methods:   qRT-PCR was performed to investigate PCGEM1 expression levels in CC tissues and cell lines. The effect of PCGEM1 on CC cells was assessed by gain- and loss-of-function assays. MS2-binding sequences-MS2-binding protein-based RIP assay (MS2-RIP), RNA pull-down and Luciferase reporter assays were performed to investigate the interaction between PCGEM1 and miR-182. The association between miR-182 and F-box and WD repeat domain containing 11 (FBXW11) was verified by luciferase reporter assay. The effect of PCGEM1 on the NF-κB and β-catenin/TCF signaling pathways was determined by luciferase reporter assay.  Results:   Our present study showed that PCGEM1 was significantly upregulated in CC tissues and cell lines. Overexpression of PCGEM1 was correlated with advanced International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage, lymph node, distant metastasis and poor prognosis in CC patients. Functionally, PCGEM1 promoted cell proliferation, cell cycle progression, migration and invasion, while suppressed cell apoptosis in CC cells. Further mechanistic investigation revealed that PCGEM1 associated with miR-182 and suppressed its expression. PCGEM1 could act as a competing endogenous (ceRNA) of oncogene F-box and WD repeat domain containing 11 (FBXW11) for miR-182 in CC cells. Additionally, PCGEM1 was capable to activate the NF-κB and β-catenin/TCF signaling pathways, which was reversed by inhibition of FBXW11.

PSMA-targeted alpha therapy (TAT) has shown early signs of activity in patients with prostate cancer refractory to beta radiation. We describe a novel, antibody-based TAT, the PSMA-targeted thorium-227 conjugate PSMA-TTC (BAY 2315497) consisting of the alpha-particle emitter thorium-227 complexed by a 3,2-HOPO chelator covalently linked to a fully human PSMA-targeting antibody.  Experimental design:   PSMA-TTC was characterized for affinity, mode of action, and cytotoxic activity in vitro. Biodistribution, pharmacokinetics, and antitumor efficacy were investigated in vivo using cell line and patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models of prostate cancer.  Results:   PSMA-TTC was selectively internalized into PSMA-positive cells and potently induced DNA damage, cell-cycle arrest, and apoptosis in vitro. Decrease in cell viability was observed dependent on the cellular PSMA expression levels. In vivo, PSMA-TTC showed strong antitumor efficacy with T/C values of 0.01 to 0.31 after a single injection at 300 to 500 kBq/kg in subcutaneous cell line and PDX models, including models resistant to standard-of-care drugs such as enzalutamide. Furthermore, inhibition of both cancer and cancer-induced abnormal bone growth was observed in a model mimicking prostate cancer metastasized to bone. Specific tumor uptake and efficacy were demonstrated using various PSMA-TTC doses and dosing schedules. Induction of DNA double-strand breaks was identified as a key mode of action for PSMA-TTC both in vitro and in vivo.  Conclusions:   The strong preclinical antitumor activity of PSMA-TTC supports its clinical evaluation, and a phase I trial is ongoing in mCRPC patients (NCT03724747).""","""['Stefanie Hammer', 'Urs B Hagemann', 'Sabine Zitzmann-Kolbe', 'Aasmund Larsen', 'Christine Ellingsen', 'Solene Geraudie', 'Derek Grant', 'Baard Indrevoll', 'Roger Smeets', 'Oliver von Ahsen', 'Alexander Kristian', 'Pascale Lejeune', 'Hartwig Hennekes', 'Jenny Karlsson', 'Roger M Bjerke', 'Olav B Ryan', 'Alan S Cuthbertson', 'Dominik Mumberg']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Clin Cancer Res""","""['Mesothelin-Targeted Thorium-227 Conjugate (MSLN-TTC): Preclinical Evaluation of a New Targeted Alpha Therapy for Mesothelin-Positive Cancers.', 'Antitumor Activity of MEDI3726 (ADCT-401), a Pyrrolobenzodiazepine Antibody-Drug Conjugate Targeting PSMA, in Preclinical Models of Prostate Cancer.', 'Darolutamide Potentiates the Antitumor Efficacy of a PSMA-targeted Thorium-227 Conjugate by a Dual Mode of Action in Prostate Cancer Models.', 'Efficacy Against Human Prostate Cancer by Prostate-specific Membrane Antigen-specific, Transforming Growth Factor-β Insensitive Genetically Targeted CD8+ T-cells Derived from Patients with Metastatic Castrate-resistant Disease.', 'Advances in Precision Oncology: Targeted Thorium-227 Conjugates As a New Modality in Targeted Alpha Therapy.', 'Efficacy of a HER2-Targeted Thorium-227 Conjugate in a HER2-Positive Breast Cancer Bone Metastasis Model.', 'Radiotheranostics in advanced prostate cancer: Current and future directions.', 'PSMA-Targeted Radiopharmaceuticals in Prostate Cancer: Current Data and New Trials.', 'Targeted thorium-227 conjugates as treatment options in oncology.', 'Development of radiopharmaceuticals for targeted alpha therapy: Where do we stand?']"""

Fusions of ETS with the EWSR1 partner gene define many members of the Ewing family of tumors, including primitive neuroectodermal tumor (PNET). Although the expression of EWSR1 appears to be necessary for the oncogenic effects of ETS factors, the EWSR1-ETS rearrangement has never been reported in PCa. Herein, we discuss the pathologic diagnosis of a prostatic tumor in a 44 year-old man, recently treated with finasteride, with the EWSR1-FEV fusion (exon 7: exon 2, join in-frame) discovered by RNA-sequencing and fluorescence in situ hybridization. The tumor was morphologically and immunophenotypically equivocal for a Ewing sarcoma/PNET, and most consistent with a PCa with neuroendocrine differentiation. The patient's family history of PCa led to germline mutation testing by next-generation sequencing showing heterozygosity for the WRNG327X mutation. The WRN protein along with ATM, BRCA1, BRCA2, and RAD51 among others, comprise a DNA repair system by homologous recombination, and its alterations are associated with forms of hereditary PCa.

Concomitant with the loss of E-cadherin during the mesenchymal transition, the predominant receptor isoform for ELR-negative CXC ligands shifts from CXCR3-B to CXCR3-A which turns this classical G-protein coupled receptor from an inhibitor to an activator of cell migration, thus promoting tumor cell invasiveness. We proposed that CXCR3 was not just a coordinately changed receptor but actually a regulator of the cell phenotype.  Methods:   Immunoblotting, immunofluorescence, quantitative real-time PCR and flow cytometry assays investigated the expression of E-cadherin and CXCR3 isoforms. Intrasplenic inoculation of human prostate cancer (PCa) cells with spontaneous metastasis to the liver analyzed E-cadherin and CXCR3-B expression during cancer progression in vivo.  Results:   We found reciprocal regulation of E-cadherin and CXCR3 isoforms. E-cadherin surface expression promoted CXCR3-B presentation on the cell membrane, and to a lesser extent increased its mRNA and total protein levels. In turn, forced expression of CXCR3-A reduced E-cadherin expression level, whereas CXCR3-B increased E-cadherin in PCa. Meanwhile, a positive correlation of E-cadherin and CXCR3-B expression was found both in experimental PCa liver micro-metastases and patients' tissue.  Conclusions:   CXCR3-B and E-cadherin positively correlated in vitro and in vivo in PCa cells and liver metastases, whereas CXCR3-A negatively regulated E-cadherin expression. These results suggest that CXCR3 isoforms may play important roles in cancer progression and dissemination via diametrically regulating tumor's phenotype.""","""['Bo Ma', 'Ahmad Khazali', 'Hanshuang Shao', 'Yuhan Jiang', 'Alan Wells']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Cell Commun Signal""","""['Down-regulation of E-cadherin enhances prostate cancer chemoresistance via Notch signaling.', 'Altered CXCR3 isoform expression regulates prostate cancer cell migration and invasion.', 'Epithelial-To-Mesenchymal Transition Markers and CD44 Isoforms Are Differently Expressed in 2D and 3D Cell Cultures of Prostate Cancer Cells.', 'CXCR3 in carcinoma progression.', 'Contribution of CXCR3-mediated signaling in the metastatic cascade of solid malignancies.', 'Patient with prostatic adenocarcinoma with plasmacytoid features and an aberrant immunohistochemical phenotype diagnosed by biopsy and a mini-review of plasmacytoid features in the genitourinary system: A case report.', 'Akt isoforms differentially provide for chemoresistance in prostate cancer.']"""

Methods:   For each patient, the study used two sets of computed tomography (CT) images for radiation treatment planning (RT-CT): (1) set with a Foley urethral catheter (4.0 mm diameter) plus a guide-wire (0.46 mm diameter) in the first RT-CT and (2) set with a guide-wire alone in the second CT recorded 2 min after the first RT-CT. Using three fiducial markers in the prostate for image fusion, the displacement between the catheter and the guide-wire in the prostatic urethra was calculated. In 155 consecutive patients treated between 2011 and 2017, 5531 slices of RT-CT were evaluated.  Results:   Assuming that ≥3.0 mm of difference between the catheter and the guide-wire position was a significant displacement, the urethra with the catheter was displaced significantly from the urethra with the guide-wire alone in > 20% of the RT-CT slices in 23.2% (36/155) of the patients. The number of patients who showed ≥3.0 mm anterior displacement with the catheter in ≥20% RT-CT slices was significantly larger at the superior segment (38/155) than at the middle (14/155) and inferior segments (18/155) of the prostatic urethra (p < 0.0167).

The whole segmentation method consists of 3 major steps. First, a cycle-consistent adversarial network (CycleGAN) was used to estimate a synthetic MRI (sMRI) from CBCT images. Second, a deep attention network was trained based on sMRI and its corresponding manual contours. Third, the segmented contours for a query patient was obtained by feeding the patient's CBCT images into the trained sMRI estimation and segmentation model. In our retrospective study, we included 100 prostate cancer patients, each of whom has CBCT acquired with prostate, bladder and rectum contoured by physicians with MRI guidance as ground truth. We trained and tested our model with separate datasets among these patients. The resulting segmentations were compared with physicians' manual contours. The Dice similarity coefficient and mean surface distance indices between our segmented and physicians' manual contours (bladder, prostate, and rectum) were 0.95 ± 0.02, 0.44 ± 0.22 mm, 0.86 ± 0.06, 0.73 ± 0.37 mm, and 0.91 ± 0.04, 0.72 ± 0.65 mm, respectively.

Studies have demonstrated that ultrasound-stimulated microbubble (USMB) treatment causes extensive endothelial cell death leading to tumour vascular disruption. The subsequent rapid vascular collapse translates to overall increases in tumour response to various therapies. In this study, we explored USMB involvement in the enhancement of hyperthermia (HT) treatment effects. Human prostate tumour (PC3) xenografts were grown in mice and were treated with USMB, HT, or with a combination of the two treatments. Treatment parameters consisted of ultrasound pressures of 0 to 740 kPa, the use of perfluorocarbon-filled microbubbles administered intravenously, and an HT temperature of 43°C delivered for various times (0-50 minutes). Single and multiple repeated treatments were evaluated. Tumour response was monitored 24 hours after treatments and tumour growth was monitored for up to over 30 days for a single treatment and 4 weeks for multiple treatments. Tumours exposed to USMB combined with HT exhibited enhanced cell death (p<0.05) and decreased vasculature (p<0.05) compared to untreated tumours or those treated with either USMB alone or HT alone within 24 hours. Deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) staining and cluster of differentiation 31 (CD31) staining were used to assess cell death and vascular content, respectively. Further, tumours receiving a single combined USMB and HT treatment exhibited decreased tumour volumes (p<0.05) compared to those receiving either treatment alone when monitored over the duration of 30 days. Additionally, tumour response monitored weekly up to 4 weeks demonstrated a reduced vascular index and tumour volume, increased fibrosis and lesser number of proliferating cells with combined treatment of USMB and HT.

Materials and methods:   We performed a retrospective cohort study of patients seen at a tertiary care medical center (1996-2012) to select patients with non-metastatic, castrate-resistant prostate cancer. Abstracted data included demographic, anthropometric, and disease-specific data such as patient race, BMI, PSA kinetics, and primary treatment. Primary outcome was metastasis on bone scan. Multivariable logistic regression was performed using generalized estimating equations to adjust for repeated measures. Risk table performance was assessed using ROC curves.  Results:   We identified 6.509 patients with prostate cancer who had received hormonal therapy with a post-hormonal therapy PSA ≥2ng/mL, 363 of whom had non-metastatic, castrate-resistant prostate cancer. Of these, 187 patients (356 bone scans) had calculable PSA kinetics and ≥1 bone scan. Median follow-up after castrate-resistant prostate cancer diagnosis was 32 months (IQR: 19-48). There were 227 (64%) negative and 129 (36%) positive bone scans. On multivariable analysis, higher PSA at castrate-resistant prostate cancer (4.67 vs. 4.4ng/mL, OR=0.57, P=0.02), shorter time from castrate-resistant prostate cancer to scan (7.9 vs. 14.6 months, OR=0.97, P=0.006) and higher PSA at scan (OR=2.91, P<0.0001) were significantly predictive of bone scan positivity.

The screened men were stratified in two age groups (45-69 years, and ≥70 years). These groups were compared regarding prostate cancer prevalence and aggressiveness criteria (PSA, Gleason score from biopsy and TNM staging).  Results:   The prevalence of prostate cancer found was 3.7%.

Although E-cadherin downregulation was previously reported in canine prostate cancer (PC), the mechanism involved in this process is unclear. It is well established that dogs, besides humans, spontaneously develop PC with high frequency; therefore, canine PC is an interesting model to study human PC. In human PC, CDH1 methylation has been associated with E-cadherin downregulation. However, no previous studies have described the methylation pattern of CDH1 promoter in canine PC. Herein, we evaluated the E-cadherin protein and gene expression in canine PC compared to normal tissues. DNA methylation pattern was investigated as a regulatory mechanism of CDH1 silencing. Our cohort is composed of 20 normal prostates, 20 proliferative inflammatory atrophy (PIA) lesions, 20 PC, and 11 metastases from 60 dogs. The E-cadherin protein expression was assessed by immunohistochemistry and western blotting and gene expression by qPCR. Bisulfite- pyrosequencing assay was performed to investigate the CDH1 promoter methylation pattern. Membranous E-cadherin expression was observed in all prostatic tissues. A higher number of E-cadherin negative cells was detected more frequently in PC compared to normal and PIA samples. High-grade PC showed a diffuse membranous positive immunostaining. Furthermore, PC patients with a higher number of E-cadherin negative cells presented shorter survival time and higher Gleason scores. Western blotting and qPCR assays confirmed the immunohistochemical results, showing lower E-cadherin protein and gene expression levels in PC compared to normal samples. We identified CDH1 promoter hypermethylation in PIA and PC samples. An in vitro assay with two canine prostate cancer cells (PC1 and PC2 cell lines) was performed to confirm the methylation as a regulatory mechanism of E-cadherin expression. PC1 cell line presented CDH1 hypermethylation and after 5-Aza-dC treatment, a decreased CDH1 methylation and increased gene expression levels were observed. Positive E-cadherin cells were massively found in metastases (mean of 90.6%). In conclusion, low levels of E-cadherin protein, gene downregulation and CDH1 hypermethylation was detected in canine PC. However, in metastatic foci occur E-cadherin re-expression confirming its relevance in these processes.""","""['Carlos Eduardo Fonseca-Alves', 'Priscila Emiko Kobayashi', 'Antonio Fernando Leis-Filho', 'Patricia de Faria Lainetti', 'Valeria Grieco', 'Hellen Kuasne', 'Silvia Regina Rogatto', 'Renee Laufer-Amorim']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Front Genet""","""['Investigation of c-KIT and Ki67 expression in normal, preneoplastic and neoplastic canine prostate.', 'CDH1 promoter hypermethylation and E-cadherin protein expression in infiltrating breast cancer.', 'Downregulation of E-cadherin expression in breast cancer by promoter hypermethylation and its relation with progression and prognosis of tumor.', 'CDH1 (E-cadherin) Gene Methylation in Human Breast Cancer: Critical Appraisal of a Long and Twisted Story.', 'The role of the E-cadherin gene (CDH1) in diffuse gastric cancer susceptibility: from the laboratory to clinical practice.', 'Comparative Pathobiology of Canine and Human Prostate Cancer: State of the Art and Future Directions.', 'P-Glycoprotein and Androgen Receptor Expression Reveals Independence of Canine Prostate Cancer from Androgen Hormone Stimulation.']"""

The factor structure of this construct in African American men is relatively unknown. This study describes the development and psychometric evaluation of an 18-item Prostate Cancer Knowledge Scale among 352 African American men. Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was conducted using weighted least square mean and variance estimation with Geomin rotation. EFA yielded three factors: PrCA Anatomy and Screening (6 items), Risk Factors (5 items), Warning Signs (7 items) with good internal consistency reliability at KR-20 = .80 for the total scale and .64, .66, and .75, respectively, for each subscale. Factor loadings ranged from .31 to .86. The standardized root mean square residual (0.08) indicated that the factor structure explained most of the correlations.

We developed models to predict clinically significant prostate cancer (csPCa) based on suspicious lesions from a TB result and based on the whole prostate gland from the results of TB plus SB or SB only. Nomograms were generated using logistic regression and evaluated using receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, calibration curves and decision analysis. The results were validated using ROC curve and calibration on 177 patients from 2018 to 2019 at the same institute.  Results:   In the multivariate analyses, prostate-specific antigen level, prostate volume, and the Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System score were predictors of csPCa in both nomograms. Age was also included in the model for suspicious lesions, while obesity was included in the model for the whole gland. The area under the curve (AUC) in the ROC analyses of the prediction models was 0.755 for suspicious lesions and 0.887 for the whole gland. Both models performed well in the calibration and decision analyses. In the validation cohort, the ROC curve described the AUCs of 0.723 and 0.917 for the nomogram of suspicious lesions and nomogram of the whole gland, respectively. Also, the calibration curve detected low error rates for both models.  Conclusion:   Nomograms with excellent discriminative ability were developed and validated.

Methods:   Using data from the National Cancer Data Base, we identified 13,652 men with a high predicted probability of 10-year survival (≤ 65 years of age and Charlson Comorbidity Index score of 0) who underwent radical prostatectomy at 1023 facilities for biopsy-confirmed localized high-risk prostate cancer diagnosed between January 2004 and December 2011. Multilevel, multinomial logistic regression was fitted to predict facility-level probability of receiving different extents of lymphadenectomy. Inverse probability of treatment weighting-adjusted Cox regression model with Bonferroni correction was fitted to compare risk of overall mortality.  Results:   Overall, 11,284 (82.7%), 1601 (11.7%), and 767 (5.6%) men who underwent radical prostatectomy underwent concomitant none/limited lymphadenectomy (0-9 lymph nodes), standard lymphadenectomy (10-16 lymph nodes), and extended lymphadenectomy (≥ 17 lymph nodes), respectively. Extended lymphadenectomy was not associated with a survival benefit relative to standard lymphadenectomy (hazard ratio [HR] 0.72, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.48-1.23; p = 0.4) nor no/limited lymphadenectomy (HR 0.77, 95% CI 0.87-2.20; p = 0.29) at a median follow-up of 83.3 months.

Studies to date, however, have focused on a relatively narrow set of lipid classes.  Objective:   The aim of this study was to uncover candidate dietary biomarkers by identifying serum metabolites correlated with self-reported diet, particularly metabolites in underinvestigated lipid classes, e.g. triglycerides and plasmalogens.  Methods:   We assessed dietary questionnaire data and serum metabolite correlations from 491 male and female participants aged 55-75 y in an exploratory cross-sectional study within the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial (PLCO). Self-reported intake was categorized into 50 foods, food groups, beverages, and supplements. We examined 522 identified metabolites using 2 metabolomics platforms (Broad Institute and Massachusetts General Hospital). Correlations were identified using partial Pearson's correlations adjusted for age, sex, BMI, smoking status, study site, and total energy intake [Bonferroni-corrected level of 0.05/(50 × 522) = 1.9 × 10-6]. We assessed prediction of dietary intake by multiple-metabolite linear models with the use of 10-fold crossvalidation least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression.  Results:   Eighteen foods, beverages, and supplements were correlated with ≥1 serum metabolite at the Bonferroni-corrected significance threshold, for a total of 102 correlations. Of these, only 5 have been reported previously, to our knowledge. Our strongest correlations were between citrus and proline betaine (r = 0.55), supplements and pantothenic acid (r = 0.46), and fish and C40:9 phosphatidylcholine (PC) (r = 0.35). The multivariate analysis similarly found reasonably large correlations between metabolite profiles and citrus (r = 0.59), supplements (r = 0.57), and fish (r = 0.44).

Here, we report that prostate tumor xenografts express high levels of HIF1α and show greatly enhanced growth in response to knockdown of the E3 ligase CHIP (C-terminus of Hsp70-interacting protein). In multiple human prostate cancer cell lines under hypoxia, taxol treatment induces the degradation of HIF1α, and this response is abrogated by knockdown of CHIP, but not by E3 ligase VHL or RACK1. HIF1α degradation is accompanied by loss of function, evidenced by reduced expression of HIF1α-dependent genes. CHIP-dependent HIF1α degradation also occurs in cells arrested in mitosis by nocodazole instead of taxol. Mitotic kinase Aurora B activity is required for taxol-induced HIF1α degradation. Purified Aurora B directly phosphorylates HIF1α at multiple sites, and these modifications enhance its polyubiquitination by CHIP in a purified reconstituted system. Our results show how activation of Aurora B promotes CHIP-dependent degradation of HIF1α in prostate cancer cells.

Methods:   Microarray-based gene expression profiling of prostate cancer was adopted to identify differentially expressed genes and regulatory miRNAs, which identified the candidates RHPN2 and miR-205 as the study focus. Then the binding affinity between miR-205 and RHPN2 was identified using in silico analysis and luciferase activity detection. Prostate cancer cells were co-cultured with exosomes derived from hBMSCs treated with either miR-205 mimic or miR-205 inhibitor. Subsequently, prostate cancer cell proliferation, invasion, migration, and apoptosis were detected in vitro. The effects of hBMSCs-miR-205 on tumor growth were investigated in vivo.  Results:   miR-205 was downregulated, while RHPN2 was upregulated in prostate cancer cells. RHPN2 was a target of miR-205, and upregulated miR-205 inhibited prostate cancer cell proliferation, invasion, and migration and promoted apoptosis by targeting RHPN2. Next, experiments demonstrated that hBMSCs-derived exosomes carrying miR-205 contributed to repressed prostate cancer cell proliferation, invasion, and migration and enhanced apoptosis.

This self-organization mechanism is significant for cellular homeostasis, but remains mostly elusive, as does the role of giantin, the largest Golgi matrix dimeric protein.  Methods:   In HeLa and different prostate cancer cells, we used the model of cellular stress induced by Brefeldin A (BFA). The conformational structure of giantin was assessed by proximity ligation assay and atomic force microscopy. The post-BFA distribution of Golgi resident enzymes was examined by 3D SIM high-resolution microscopy.  Results:   We detected that giantin is rather flexible than an extended coiled-coil dimer and BFA-induced Golgi disassembly was associated with giantin monomerization. A fusion of the nascent Golgi membranes after BFA washout is forced by giantin re-dimerization via disulfide bond in its luminal domain and assisted by Rab6a GTPase. GM130-GRASP65-dependent enzymes are able to reach the nascent Golgi membranes, while giantin-sensitive enzymes appeared at the Golgi after its complete recovery via direct interaction of their cytoplasmic tail with N-terminus of giantin.  Conclusion:   Post-stress recovery of Golgi is conducted by giantin dimer and Golgi proteins refill membranes according to their docking affiliation rather than their intra-Golgi location.""","""['Cole P Frisbie', 'Alexander Y Lushnikov', 'Alexey V Krasnoslobodtsev', 'Jean-Jack M Riethoven', 'Jennifer L Clarke', 'Elena I Stepchenkova', 'Armen Petrosyan']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Cells""","""['Shifted Golgi targeting of glycosyltransferases and α-mannosidase IA from giantin to GM130-GRASP65 results in formation of high mannose N-glycans in aggressive prostate cancer cells.', 'Restoration of compact Golgi morphology in advanced prostate cancer enhances susceptibility to galectin-1-induced apoptosis by modifying mucin O-glycan synthesis.', 'Giantin Is Required for Post-Alcohol Recovery of Golgi in Liver Cells.', 'Unlocking Golgi: Why Does Morphology Matter?', 'Nonredundant Roles of GRASP55 and GRASP65 in the Golgi Apparatus and Beyond.', 'Rab6-mediated retrograde trafficking from the Golgi: the trouble with tubules.', 'Alcohol and Prostate Cancer: Time to Draw Conclusions.', 'The non-canonical mechanism of ER stress-mediated progression of prostate cancer.', 'Alcohol-Induced Liver Injury: Down-regulation and Redistribution of Rab3D Results in Atypical Protein Trafficking.']"""

To improve efficacy and reduce toxicity, here, using the Proteolysis Targeted Chimeras (PROTACs) approach, we design and further optimize small molecule degraders targeting multiple CDKs.

Mechanism dissection revealed that R-2HG could increase circRNA-51217 expression to sponge miRNA-646, which might then lead to increase TGFβ1 expression and thus induce TGFβ1/p-Smad2/3 signaling to increase PCa cell invasion.

Materials and methods:   A total of 98 patients underwent single port robotic prostatectomy using the da Vinci SP® robotic system with extraperitoneal (group I, 52) vs transperitoneal (group II, 46) approach. Demographics and perioperative data including postoperative recovery outcomes were recorded and compared between the 2 groups.  Results:   Groups were similar in terms of demographics and prostate cancer risk category. Mean operative time (201±37.5 vs 248.2±42.3 minutes, p <0.00001) as well as median postoperative hospital stay (4.3 vs 25.7 hours p <0.0001) was significantly shorter with the extraperitoneal approach. Overall need for pain medications or narcotics as well as the required amount of narcotics per patient (if administered) were significantly lower with the extraperitoneal approach. Extraprostatic extension was detected in 48.1% vs 41.3% of patients in groups I and II, respectively. Surgical margins were positive in 26.9% in group I vs 41.3% in group II (p=0.13).

Materials and methods:   We identified robot-assisted radical prostatectomies for clinically localized (cT1-2N0M0) prostate cancer diagnosed between 2010 and 2014 in the National Cancer Database. We categorized annual average hospital robot-assisted radical prostatectomy volume into very low, low, medium, high and very high by most closely sorting the final included patients into 5 equal-sized groups (quintiles). Outcomes included 30-day mortality, 90-day mortality, conversion (to open), prolonged length of stay (more than 2 days), 30-day (unplanned) readmission, positive surgical margin and lymph node dissection rates.  Results:   A total of 114,957 patients were included in the study, and hospital volume was categorized into very low (3 to 45 cases per year), low (46 to 72), medium (73 to 113), high (114 to 218) and very high (219 or more). Overall 30-day mortality (0.12%), 90-day mortality (0.16%) and conversion rates (0.65%) were low.

We investigated the association between postoperative circulating tumor cell detection after radical prostatectomy and disease recurrence in prospectively enrolled patients with prostate cancer.  Materials and methods:   A total of 203 patients with an undetectable prostate specific antigen who had undergone radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer were prospectively enrolled. Circulating tumor cell sampling was performed at a median of 4.5 months after surgery. The primary end point was biochemical recurrence-free survival. Detection of circulating tumor cells in the blood of patients was performed using a novel approach with a replication-competent adenovirus controlled by prostate specific antigen/prostate specific membrane antigen transcription regulatory elements (Ad5/35E1aPSESE4).  Results:   Circulating tumor cells were detected in 73 (36.0%) patients with undetectable prostate specific antigen concentrations after surgery. The 3-year biochemical recurrence-free survival rate from the time of surgery was significantly higher in circulating tumor cell-negative than in circulating tumor cell-positive cases (81.6% vs 48.9%, log rank p <0.001). Multivariable analysis showed that postoperative circulating tumor cell detection was independently associated with an increased risk of biochemical recurrence (HR 5.42, 95% CI 3.24-9.06, p <0.001). C-index was increased in combinations of multivariable model and postoperative circulating tumor cell detection compared with the multivariable model alone.  Conclusions:   Circulating tumor cells in the blood were frequently detected in patients with undetectable prostate specific antigen levels after radical prostatectomy for localized prostate cancer. Furthermore, circulating tumor cell detection was associated with an increased risk of biochemical recurrence, suggesting that circulating tumor cell detection precedes prostate specific antigen rise after surgery in cases of prostate cancer recurrence. Large-scale validation is needed in the future.""","""['Sahyun Pak', 'Yoon Seok Suh', 'Dong-Eun Lee', 'Sung Han Kim', 'Jae Young Joung', 'Weon Seo Park', 'Sang-Jin Lee', 'Kang Hyun Lee']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""J Urol""","""['Identification and Characterization of Circulating Tumor Cells in Men Who have Undergone Prostatectomy for Clinically Localized, High Risk Prostate Cancer.', 'Do Ultrasensitive Prostate Specific Antigen Measurements Have a Role in Predicting Long-Term Biochemical Recurrence-Free Survival in Men after Radical Prostatectomy?', 'Quantitative RT-PCR analysis of PSA and prostate-specific membrane antigen mRNA to detect circulating tumor cells improves recurrence-free survival nomogram prediction after radical prostatectomy.', 'The impact of perioperative blood transfusion on survival and recurrence after radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer: A systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Next generation biomarkers in prostate cancer.', 'IONPs-Based Medical Imaging in Cancer Care: Moving Beyond Traditional Diagnosis and Therapeutic Assessment.', 'Value of peripheral blood circulating tumor cell detection in the diagnosis of thoracic diseases and the prediction of severity.', 'From COPD to Lung Cancer: Mechanisms Linking, Diagnosis, Treatment, and Prognosis.', 'Geometric structure design of passive label-free microfluidic systems for biological micro-object separation.', 'Recurrence and Prognostic Value of Circulating Tumor Cells in Resectable Pancreatic Head Cancer: A Single Center Retrospective Study.']"""

Materials and methods:   Serum levels of 9 steroids were measured by mass spectrometry from continuously castrated patients of the PR.7 study (219) and from the PCA24 cohort (116). For each steroid standard curves for dose dependent prostate specific antigen promoter activation were built in castration sensitive (LAPC4) and resistant (VCaP) prostate cancer models. Standard curves were used to determine the androgen receptor activation potency for each steroid measurement from patients in these trials.  Results:   In LAPC4 and VCaP cells testosterone, dihydrotestosterone and androstenedione induced androgen receptor transcriptional activity, while dehydroepiandrosterone, 5alpha-androstan-3beta,17beta-diol, androstenediol and androsterone stimulated androgen receptor only in VCaP cells. Extragonadal steroids were responsible for 34% (LAPC4) and 88% (VCaP) of the serum total androgen receptor transcriptional activity found in castrated cases. The total androgen receptor transcriptional activity secondary to testosterone, dihydrotestosterone and androstenedione was associated with time to castration resistance in patients from the PR.7 study (HR 2.17, 95% CI 1.12-4.23, p=0.02) in multivariate analysis using the castration sensitive model (LAPC4). Androgen receptor transcriptional activity of extragonadal androstenedione was the only steroid statistically associated with time to castration resistance in univariate analysis (HR 1.89, 95% CI 1.04-3.44, p=0.036).  Conclusions:   Extragonadal steroids contribute significantly to the androgen receptor axis activation at castration levels of testosterone in recurrent nonmetastatic prostate cancer and these sustain the development of castration resistance after primary local treatment.""","""['Frédéric Pouliot', 'Mélanie Rouleau', 'Bertrand Neveu', 'Paul Toren', 'Fannie Morin', 'Lauriane Vélot', 'Keyue Ding', 'Patrick Caron', 'Louis Lacombe', 'Éric Lévesque', 'Laurence Klotz', 'Chantal Guillemette']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""J Urol""","""['Prostatakarzinom: Extragonadale Steroide treiben Kastrationsresistenz voran.', 'Extensive Alteration of Androgen Precursor Levels After Castration in Prostate Cancer Patients and Their Association With Active Androgen Level.', 'AR Signaling in Prostate Cancer Regulates a Feed-Forward Mechanism of Androgen Synthesis by Way of HSD3B1 Upregulation.', 'Profiling adrenal 11β-hydroxyandrostenedione metabolites in prostate cancer cells, tissue and plasma: UPC2-MS/MS quantification of 11β-hydroxytestosterone, 11keto-testosterone and 11keto-dihydrotestosterone.', 'Castration-recurrent prostate cancer is not androgen-independent.', 'Biology of castration-recurrent prostate cancer.', 'Preclinical models of prostate cancer - modelling androgen dependency and castration resistance in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo.', 'A transcriptional biosensor to monitor single cancer cell therapeutic responses by bioluminescence microscopy.', 'Steroid Sulphatase and Its Inhibitors: Past, Present, and Future.', 'The history of intermittent androgen deprivation therapy - A Canadian story.']"""

AMHRII is overexpressed in some malignant cells, so at present recombinant AMH (rAMH) is considered as a new candidate antineoplastic drug. The use of rAMH may be especially effective in case of such severe diseases as ovarian, prostate and breast cancer. However, the development of a new drug is hampered by the laboriousness of obtaining highly purified rAMH and by the lack of data about the pharmacological characteristics of rAMH derivatives. In this work, we obtained preparations of prohormone, half-cleaved rAMH and a C-terminal fragment of rAMH, which was confirmed by qualitative and quantitative analyses. To obtain rAMH and its derivatives we used a previously developed highly effective producer strain containing the optimized human AMH gene. The production process has been divided into several stages: (a) rAMH biosynthesis in the bioreactor; (b) culture media preparation; (c) purification of rAMH and its derivatives using immunoaffinity chromatography and reversed-phase HPLC; (d) identification of the purified proteins by immunoblotting and analytical reversed-phase HPLC; and (e) evaluation of the hormone forms activity.

Methods:   People managed for cancer in 2014-2015, who died in 2015 and who were covered by the national health insurance general scheme (77% of the French population) were selected from the national health data system in order to analyze the health care reimbursed during the year and the month before their death.  Results:   This study included 125,497 people (mean age 73 years, SD 12.5) managed for cancer: colorectal: 12%, lung: 18%, prostate: 9%, breast: 8% and other: 62%. Almost 67% of people died in short-stay hospitals (SSH), 8% died in rehabilitation units (Rehab), 4% died in hospital at home (HaH), 5% died in skilled nursing homes (SNH) and 15% died at home or another place. The mean annual duration of all types of hospitalization was 70 days (SD 66) and 59% of patients had received hospital palliative care (HPC). During the last month of life, 42% of people had attended an emergency department at least once and people who had received HPC were less often admitted to an intensive care unit (10% versus 23%, 15% overall). During the month before death, 17% of patients had received intravenous chemotherapy (lung 23%, breast 21%) and 9% had received a pharmacy reimbursement for another form of chemotherapy (prostate 24%, breast 19%). The main cause of death was a tumour for 81% of patients: after management of lung cancer in 91% of cases, breast cancer in 81% of cases, colorectal cancer in 76% of cases and prostate cancer in 63% of cases.  Conclusions:   Cancer management and death mostly occurred in SSH in France. Cancer patients frequently attend the emergency department and frequently receive chemotherapy during the last month of life.

Methods:   The PRECISE criteria score the likelihood of clinically significant change over time. The system is a 1-to-5 scale, where 1 or 2 implies regression of a previously visible lesion, 3 denotes stability and 4 or 5 indicates radiological progression. A retrospective analysis of 80 patients (40 from each centre) on AS with a biopsy-confirmed low- or intermediate-risk PCa (i.e. ≤ Gleason 3 + 4 and prostate-specific antigen ≤ 20 ng/ml) and ≥ 2 prostate MR scans was performed. Two blinded radiologists reported all scans independently and scored the likelihood of radiological change (PRECISE score) from the second scan onwards. Cohen's κ coefficients and percent agreement were computed.  Results:   Agreement was substantial both at a per-patient and a per-scan level (κ = 0.71 and 0.61; percent agreement = 79% and 81%, respectively) for each PRECISE score. The agreement was superior (κ = 0.83 and 0.67; percent agreement = 90% and 91%, respectively) when the PRECISE scores were grouped according to the absence/presence of radiological progression (PRECISE 1-3 vs 4-5). Higher inter-reader agreement was observed for the scans performed at University College London (UCL) (κ = 0.81 vs 0.55 on a per-patient level and κ = 0.70 vs 0.48 on a per-scan level, respectively).

To date, efforts to develop combination therapies have not translated into new treatments. We sought to develop a novel therapeutic strategy to tackle chemoresistant prostate cancer by enhancing the efficacy of docetaxel.  Methods:   We performed a drug-repurposing screen by using murine-derived prostate cancer cell lines driven by clinically relevant genotypes. Cells were treated with docetaxel alone, or in combination with drugs (n = 857) from repurposing libraries, with cytotoxicity quantified using High Content Imaging Analysis.  Results:   Mebendazole (an anthelmintic drug that inhibits microtubule assembly) was selected as the lead drug and shown to potently synergise docetaxel-mediated cell killing in vitro and in vivo. Dual targeting of the microtubule structure was associated with increased G2/M mitotic block and enhanced cell death. Strikingly, following combined docetaxel and mebendazole treatment, no cells divided correctly, forming multipolar spindles that resulted in aneuploid daughter cells. Liposomes entrapping docetaxel and mebendazole suppressed in vivo prostate tumour growth and extended progression-free survival.

However, most studies evaluating the GC have had a modest representation of African-American men (AAM). We evaluated the GC within a large Veteran Affairs cohort and compared its performance to CAPRA-S for predicting outcomes in AAM and non-AAM after RP.  Methods:   GC scores were generated for 548 prostate cancer (PC) patients, who underwent RP at the Durham Veteran Affairs Medical Center between 1989 and 2016. This was a clinically high-risk cohort and was selected to have either pT3a, positive margins, seminal vesicle invasion, or received post-RP radiotherapy. Multivariable Cox models and survival C-indices were used to compare the performance of GC and CAPRA-S for predicting the risk of metastasis and PC-specific mortality (PCSM).  Results:   Median follow-up was 9 years, during which 37 developed metastasis and 20 died from PC. Overall, 55% (n = 301) of patients were AAM. In multivariable analyses, GC (high vs. intermediate and intermediate vs. low) was a significant predictor of metastasis in all men (all p < 0.001). Consistent with prior studies, relative to CAPRA-S, GC had a higher C-index for 5-year metastasis (0.78 vs. 0.72) and 10-year PCSM (0.85 vs. 0.81). There was a suggestion GC was a stronger predictor in AAM than non-AAM. Specifically, the 5-year metastasis risk C-index was 0.86 in AAM vs. 0.69 in non-AAM and the 10-year PCSM risk C-index was 0.91 in AAM vs. 0.78 in non-AAM. However, the test for interaction of race and the performance of the GC in the Cox model was not significant for either metastasis or PCSM (both p ≥ 0.3).  Conclusions:   GC was a very strong predictor of poor outcome and performed well in both AAM and non-AAM. Our data support the use of GC for risk stratification in AAM post-RP.

Cancer diagnosis leads to a substantial burden on the individual, their family and society. The main aim of this study is to understand the trends, determinants and inequalities associated with cancer incidence, hospitalisation, mortality and its burden over the period 1982 to 2014 in Australia.  Settings:   The study was conducted in Australia.  Study design:   An incidence-based study design was used.  Methods:   Data came from the publicly accessible Australian Institute of Health and Welfare database. This contained 2 784 148 registered cancer cases over the study period for all types of cancer. Erreygers' concentration index was used to examine the magnitude of socioeconomic inequality with regards to cancer outcomes. Furthermore, a generalised linear model was constructed to identify the influential factors on the overall burden of cancer.  Results:   The results showed that cancer incidence (annual average percentage change, AAPC=1.33%), hospitalisation (AAPC=1.27%), cancer-related mortality (AAPC=0.76%) and burden of cancer (AAPC=0.84%) all increased significantly over the period. The same-day (AAPC=1.35%) and overnight (AAPC=1.19%) hospitalisation rates also showed an increasing trend. Further, the ratio (least-most advantaged economic resources ratio, LMR of mortality (M) and LMR of incidence (I)) was especially high for cervix (M/I=1.802), prostate (M/I=1.514), melanoma (M/I=1.325), non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (M/I=1.325) and breast (M/I=1.318), suggesting that survival inequality was most pronounced for these cancers. Socioeconomically disadvantaged people were more likely to bear an increasing cancer burden in terms of incidence, mortality and death.

Here, we found that the AR might function via differentially altering vasculogenic mimicry (VM) formation to either decrease PCa metastasis or increase BCa metastasis. Mechanism dissection showed that the AR could differentially alter the expression of the VM marker SLPI through miR-525-5p to regulate SLPI; moreover, it could either increase miR-525-5p transcription in PCa or decrease it in BCa via binding to different androgen-response-elements (AREs) located at different positions in the miR-525 precursor promoter. Further, results from liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) showed that the co-factors of AR in PCa and BCa are NFIX and HDAC2, respectively. Together, these results provide the first detailed mechanism of how the AR can differentially alter PCa and BCa metastasis; thus, targeting the newly identified AR-miR-525-5p-SLPI axis may help suppress metastasis.""","""['Zhao Yang', 'Jiaqi Chen', 'Hongjun Xie', 'Tianjie Liu', 'Yule Chen', 'Zhenkun Ma', 'Xinqi Pei', 'Wenjie Yang', 'Lei Li']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Cancer Lett""","""['Targeting androgen receptor (AR) with antiandrogen Enzalutamide increases prostate cancer cell invasion yet decreases bladder cancer cell invasion via differentially altering the AR/circRNA-ARC1/miR-125b-2-3p or miR-4736/PPARγ/MMP-9 signals.', 'Androgen receptor suppresses vasculogenic mimicry in hepatocellular carcinoma via circRNA7/miRNA7-5p/VE-cadherin/Notch4 signalling.', 'Tumor microenvironment B cells increase bladder cancer metastasis via modulation of the IL-8/androgen receptor (AR)/MMPs signals.', 'Targeting the androgen receptor in prostate and breast cancer: several new agents in development.', 'Androgen receptor-related micro RNAs in prostate cancer and their role in antiandrogen drug resistance.', 'Dietary iron modulates gut microbiota and induces SLPI secretion to promote colorectal tumorigenesis.', 'The androgen receptor in bladder cancer.', 'Up-regulation of secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor in human samples might have a potential role of predicting prostate cancer recurrence and progression after surgery and hormonal therapy.', 'Histochemical Staining of Vasculogenic Mimicry.', 'The Role of Androgen Receptor and microRNA Interactions in Androgen-Dependent Diseases.']"""

Constitutively active signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) has been proposed as a pathogenic factor and a therapeutic target of melanoma. Brevilin A, a sesquiterpene lactone isolated from Centipeda minima (L.) A. Br. et Aschers., has been shown to exert antineoplastic effects and inhibit the STAT3 pathway in nasopharyngeal, lung, prostate and breast cancer cells. This study aimed to determine whether brevilin A has anti-melanoma effects, and whether STAT3 signaling is involved in the effects.  Main methods:   A mouse A375 xenograft model, as well as A375 and A2058 cell models were employed to assess the in vivo and in vitro anti-melanoma effects of brevilin A. A375 cells stably expressing STAT3C, a constitutively active STAT3 mutant, were used to determine the role of STAT3 signaling in brevilin A's anti-melanoma effects.  Key findings:   Intraperitoneal injection of brevilin A dose-dependently inhibited melanoma growth in mice and suppressed STAT3 phosphorylation in the tumors. In cultured cells, brevilin A reduced cell viability, induced apoptosis, suppressed migration and invasion, decreased protein levels of phospho-JAK2 (Y1007/1008) and phospho-STAT3 (Tyr705), and restrained STAT3 nuclear localization. STAT3 over-activation diminished brevilin A's effects on cell viability and migration. Collectively, brevilin A exerts anti-melanoma effects and these effects are at least in part attributed to the inhibition of the JAK2/STAT3 pathway.

Objective:   To assess the correlation of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) kinetics with overall survival (OS) and radiological progression-free survival (rPFS).  Design, setting, and participants:   A post hoc analysis of data from 597 men receiving AAP + ADT and 602 receiving PBO + ADT.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   The associations of PSA-related outcomes (rates of confirmed 50% [PSA50] and 90% [PSA90] decline from baseline PSA [Prostate Cancer Working Group 2 criteria], rates of PSA < 0.2 ng/ml, median nadir PSA, time to PSA nadir [TPN], and time to PSA progression [TPP] with long-term outcomes [OS and rPFS]) were evaluated. Hazard ratios (HRs) were estimated using Cox proportional hazard model. Correlations of TPP with coprimary endpoints rPFS and OS were evaluated using Kendall's tau (KT).  Results and limitations:   AAP + ADT significantly delayed median TPP versus PBO + ADT (33.2 vs 7.4 mo; HR: 0.3, p < 0.001). TPP correlated with rPFS (KT = 0.921) and OS (KT = 0.666). In the AAP + ADT group, 91% had PSA50 and 79% had PSA90 responses (relative risk [RR]: 1.36 and 2.30, respectively; p < 0.001 for both comparisons vs PBO + ADT). Compared with nonresponders, PSA50 and PSA90 responders had reduced risk of death (RR: 0.44 and 0.12, respectively). At 6 mo, 40% receiving AAP + ADT and 6.5% receiving PBO + ADT achieved PSA ≤0.1 ng/ml, which was significantly associated with longer rPFS and OS. Median nadir PSA was 0.09 ng/ml with AAP + ADT versus 2.36 ng/ml with PBO + ADT. Median TPN (AAP + ADT, 6.4 mo; PBO + ADT, 3.8 mo) positively correlated with rPFS and OS.  Conclusions:   Superior PSA response dynamics with AAP + ADT versus ADT + PBO strongly correlated with long-term outcomes of rPFS and OS in high-risk mCSPC.

Performing radical prostatectomy 90-180 days before or after the biopsy does not have an impact on its undergrading in any of the groups. In the univariate and multivariate analysis, the presence of tumor or pathological rectal examination in both lobes, the tumor load ≥50% of cylinders and a DPSA ≥0.20, showed independent discriminative capacity to select patients who presented GSBU.

In this study we investigated the association between pre-operative plasma metabolites and risk of biochemical-, local- and metastatic-recurrence, with the aim of improving patient stratification.  Methods:   We conducted a case-control study within a cohort of PCa patients recruited between 1996 and 2015. The age-matched primary cases (n = 33) were stratified in low risk, high risk without progression and high risk with progression as defined by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network. These samples were compared to metastatic (n = 9) and healthy controls (n = 10). The pre-operative plasma from primary cases and the plasma from metastatic patients and controls were assessed with untargeted metabolomics by LC-MS. The association between risk of progression and metabolite abundance was calculated using multivariate Cox proportional-hazard regression and the relationship between metabolites and outcome was calculated using median cut-off normalized values of metabolite abundance by Log-Rank test using the Kaplan Meier method.  Results:   Medium-chain acylcarnitines (C6-C12) were positively associated with the risk of PSA progression (p = 0.036, median cut-off) while long-chain acylcarnitines (C14-C16) were inversely associated with local (p = 0.034) and bone progression (p = 0.0033). In primary cases, medium-chain acylcarnitines were positively associated with suberic acid, which also correlated with the risk of PSA progression (p = 0.032, Log-Rank test). In the metastatic samples, this effect was consistent for hexanoylcarnitine, L.octanoylcarnitine and decanoylcarnitine. Medium-chain acylcarnitines and suberic acid displayed the same inverse association with tryptophan, while indoleacetic acid, a breakdown product of tryptophan metabolism was strongly associated with PSA (p = 0.0081, Log-Rank test) and lymph node progression (p = 0.025, Log-Rank test). These data were consistent with the increased expression of indoleamine 2,3 dioxygenase (IDO1) in metastatic versus primary samples (p = 0.014). Finally, functional experiments revealed a synergistic effect of long chain fatty acids in combination with dihydrotestosterone administration on the transcription of androgen responsive genes.

Structural and copy number variations in cancer genomes can be determined via abnormal mapping of sequenced reads to the reference genome. Recently it became possible to reconcile both of these types of large-scale variations into a karyotype graph representation of the rearranged cancer genomes. Such a representation, however, does not directly describe the linear and/or circular structure of the underlying rearranged cancer chromosomes, thus limiting possible analysis of cancer genomes somatic evolutionary process as well as functional genomic changes brought by the large-scale genome rearrangements.  Results:   Here we address the aforementioned limitation by introducing a novel methodological framework for recovering rearranged cancer chromosomes from karyotype graphs. For a cancer karyotype graph we formulate an Eulerian Decomposition Problem (EDP) of finding a collection of linear and/or circular rearranged cancer chromosomes that are determined by the graph. We derive and prove computational complexities for several variations of the EDP. We then demonstrate that Eulerian decomposition of the cancer karyotype graphs is not always unique and present the Consistent Contig Covering Problem (CCCP) of recovering unambiguous cancer contigs from the cancer karyotype graph, and describe a novel algorithm CCR capable of solving CCCP in polynomial time. We apply CCR on a prostate cancer dataset and demonstrate that it is capable of consistently recovering large cancer contigs even when underlying cancer genomes are highly rearranged.  Conclusions:   CCR can recover rearranged cancer contigs from karyotype graphs thereby addressing existing limitation in inferring chromosomal structures of rearranged cancer genomes and advancing our understanding of both patient/cancer-specific as well as the overall genetic instability in cancer.""","""['Sergey Aganezov', 'Ilya Zban', 'Vitaly Aksenov', 'Nikita Alexeev', 'Michael C Schatz']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""BMC Bioinformatics""","""['On the distribution of cycles and paths in multichromosomal breakpoint graphs and the expected value of rearrangement distance.', 'The median problems on linear multichromosomal genomes: graph representation and fast exact solutions.', 'Reconstructing cancer karyotypes from short read data: the half empty and half full glass.', 'Genome rearrangement by the double cut and join operation.', 'Modelling chromosome structural and copy number changes to understand cancer genomes.', 'GRIDSS2: comprehensive characterisation of somatic structural variation using single breakend variants and structural variant phasing.', 'Comprehensive analysis of structural variants in breast cancer genomes using single-molecule sequencing.']"""

Accurate dose reconstruction is performed by using a prostate intrafraction motion trace which is obtained with a soft-tissue based rigid registration method on 3D cine-MR dynamics with a temporal resolution of 11 s. The recorded motion of each time-point was applied to the planning CT, resulting in the respective dynamic volume used for dose calculation. For each treatment fraction, the treatment delivery record was generated by proportionally splitting the plan into 11 s intervals based on the delivered monitor units. For each fraction the doses of all partial plan/dynamic volume combinations were calculated and were summed to lead to the motion-affected fraction dose. Finally, for each patient the five fraction doses were summed, yielding the total treatment dose. Both daily and total doses were compared to the original reference dose of the respective patient to assess the impact of the intrafraction motion. Depending on the underlying motion of the prostate, different types of motion-affected dose distributions were observed. The planning target volumes (PTVs) ensured CTV_30 (seminal vesicles) D99% coverage for all patients, CTV_35 (prostate corpus) coverage for 97% of the patients and GTV_50 (local boost) for 83% of the patients when compared against the strict planning target D99% value.

On the one hand, some EDCs are used as important pharmaceutical drugs that one would not want to dismiss. On the other hand, these pharmaceutical drugs are having off-target effects and increasingly significant exposure to the general population with unwanted health implications. Flutamide, one of the top pharmaceutical products marketed all over the world for the treatment of prostate cancer, is also a pollutant. Its therapeutic action mainly depends on targeting the androgen receptors and inhibiting the androgen action that is essential for growth and survival of prostate tissue. Currently flutamide is of concern with respect to its categorization as an endocrine disruptor. In this work we have developed a physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model of flutamide that could serve as a standard tool for its human risk assessment. First we built the model for rat (where many parameters have been measured). The rat PBPK model was extrapolated to human where the re-parameterization involved human-specific physiology, metabolic kinetics derived from in-vitro studies, and the partition coefficient same as the rat model. We have harmonized the model by integrating different sets of in-vitro, in-vivo and physiological data into a PBPK model. Then the model was used to simulate different exposure scenarios and the results were compared against the observed data. Both uncertainty and sensitivity analysis was done. Since this new whole-body PBPK model can predict flutamide concentrations not only in plasma but also in various organs, the model may have clinical applications in efficacy and safety assessment of flutamide. The model can also be used for reverse dosimetry in the context of interpreting the available biomonitoring data to estimate the degree to which the population is currently being exposed, and a tool for the pharmaceutical companies to validate the estimated Permitted Daily Exposure (PDE) for flutamide.""","""['Raju Prasad Sharma', 'Vikas Kumar', 'Marta Schuhmacher', 'Alexey Kolodkin', 'Hans V Westerhoff']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Environ Res""","""['Development of a human physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model for phthalate (DEHP) and its metabolites: A bottom up modeling approach.', 'In vitro-to-in vivo extrapolation (IVIVE) by PBTK modeling for animal-free risk assessment approaches of potential endocrine-disrupting compounds.', 'Use of in vitro data in developing a physiologically based pharmacokinetic model: Carbaryl as a case study.', 'Review on crosstalk and common mechanisms of endocrine disruptors: Scaffolding to improve PBPK/PD model of EDC mixture.', 'Parameters for pyrethroid insecticide QSAR and PBPK/PD models for human risk assessment.', 'Systems Biology in ELIXIR: modelling in the spotlight.', 'An open-access data set of pig skin anatomy and physiology for modelling purposes.', 'Pharmacokinetics of PEGylated Gold Nanoparticles: In Vitro-In Vivo Correlation.', 'Physiologically based metformin pharmacokinetics model of mice and scale-up to humans for the estimation of concentrations in various tissues.', 'Measurement of total liver blood flow in intact anesthetized rats using ultrasound imaging.']"""

Methods:   We analyzed data from 524 families with PALB2 PVs from 21 countries. Complex segregation analysis was used to estimate relative risks (RRs; relative to country-specific population incidences) and absolute risks of cancers. The models allowed for residual familial aggregation of breast and ovarian cancer and were adjusted for the family-specific ascertainment schemes.  Results:   We found associations between PALB2 PVs and risk of female breast cancer (RR, 7.18; 95% CI, 5.82 to 8.85; P = 6.5 × 10-76), ovarian cancer (RR, 2.91; 95% CI, 1.40 to 6.04; P = 4.1 × 10-3), pancreatic cancer (RR, 2.37; 95% CI, 1.24 to 4.50; P = 8.7 × 10-3), and male breast cancer (RR, 7.34; 95% CI, 1.28 to 42.18; P = 2.6 × 10-2). There was no evidence for increased risks of prostate or colorectal cancer. The breast cancer RRs declined with age (P for trend = 2.0 × 10-3). After adjusting for family ascertainment, breast cancer risk estimates on the basis of multiple case families were similar to the estimates from families ascertained through population-based studies (P for difference = .41). On the basis of the combined data, the estimated risks to age 80 years were 53% (95% CI, 44% to 63%) for female breast cancer, 5% (95% CI, 2% to 10%) for ovarian cancer, 2%-3% (95% CI females, 1% to 4%; 95% CI males, 2% to 5%) for pancreatic cancer, and 1% (95% CI, 0.2% to 5%) for male breast cancer.  Conclusion:   These results confirm PALB2 as a major breast cancer susceptibility gene and establish substantial associations between germline PALB2 PVs and ovarian, pancreatic, and male breast cancers.

Expression of β-hCG has been demonstrated in cervical and endometrial carcinoma and other non-germ cell tumours of the ovary, vulva, breast, prostate, lung, colon, oral/facial tissue and stomach.  Case report:   We report a 43-year-old premenopausal woman with p16 positive squamous cell anal cancer. Pre-treatment urinary screening was positive for β-hCG (218 IU/L), which was confirmed on serum and expressed in the tumour. Pelvic ultrasound ruled out pregnancy. Cervical cytology detected human papilloma virus p16 infection and a potential squamous intraepithelial lesion. Management and outcome: She received definitive chemoradiation (Mitomycin/5-fluorouracil) for six weeks. β-hCG, taken four weeks post completion, had returned to normal levels (<2 IU/L).  Discussion:   Cases of elevated serum β-hCG are documented in different cancers including breast, gastric, lung, ovarian and renal cell. In our case, the elevated β-hCG is probably ectopic excretion by the squamous cell carcinoma tumour in the anus. While this has never been reported previously in the anus, it is likely due to the documented risk of development of precancerous as well as cancerous anal and cervical lesions through human papilloma virus infection. Raised levels of β-hCG have been reported in cervical cancers. Other possible causes of β-hCG elevation were excluded. Following treatment, her β-hCG level returned to normal strengthening the hypothesis that β-hCG elevation was due to the anal carcinoma. In conclusion, unexplained ectopic secretion of β-hCG may be the first sign of a primary malignancy.""","""['Khageshwor Pokharel', 'Peter J Gilbar', 'Scott K Mansfield', 'Lekshmi M Nair', 'Albertina So']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""J Oncol Pharm Pract""","""['An unexpected reason for elevated human chorionic gonadotropin in a young woman.

Hence, new therapeutic concepts and drug delivery strategies are urgently needed for the eradication of this devastating disease. Here we report the highly specific, in situ click chemistry driven pretargeted delivery of cytotoxic drug carriers to PSMA(+) prostate cancer cells. Anti-PSMA 5D3 mAb and its F(ab')2 fragments were functionalized with trans-cyclooctene (TCO), labeled with a fluorophore, and used as pretargeting components. Human serum albumin (ALB) was loaded with the DM1 antitubulin agent, functionalized with PEGylated tetrazine (PEG4-Tz), labeled with a fluorophore, and used as the drug delivery component. The internalization kinetics of components and the therapeutic efficacy of the pretargeted click therapy were studied in PSMA(+) PC3-PIP and PSMA(-) PC3-Flu control cells. The F(ab')2 fragments were internalized faster than 5D3 mAb in PSMA(+) PC3-PIP cells. In the two-component pretargeted imaging study, both components were colocalized in a perinuclear location of the cytoplasm of PC3-PIP cells. Better colocalization was achieved when 5D3 mAb was used as the pretargeting component. Consecutively, the in vitro cell viability study shows a significantly higher therapeutic effect of click therapy in PC3-PIP cells when 5D3 mAb was used for pretargeting, compared to its F(ab')2 derivative. 5D3 mAb has a longer lifetime on the cell surface, when compared to its F(ab')2 analogue, enabling efficient cross-linking with the drug delivery component and increased efficacy.

We assessed treatment-related expectations for benefit among patients with metastatic prostate cancer and explored associated sociodemographic characteristics.  Methods:   Men with metastatic prostate cancer (N = 100) completed surveys assessing their treatment-related expectations for cancer cure, symptom relief, and prolonged life expectancy. Frequencies were used to describe the proportions of reported expectations. Fisher's exact tests were used to assess the associations of sociodemographic characteristics with treatment expectations.  Results:   One third (33%) of participants believed treatment was at least a little likely to cure their metastatic cancer. Most participants believed treatment could provide symptom relief (76%) and extend life expectancy (95%). Among participants reporting that cancer cure was at least a little likely vs not at all, more men identified as non-white (24% vs 5%; P = .01), self-reported good health (90% vs 58%; P < .01), and had greater optimism (78% vs 47%; P < .01). Among participants reporting that symptom relief was at least a little likely vs not at all, more men were less than 70 years old (62% vs 0%; P = .01).  Conclusion:   A large proportion of patients with metastatic prostate cancer reported beliefs inconsistent with understanding that treatment was not curative.

Results:   The number of GRORs increased by 66% from 114 in 2007 to 189 in 2018 (p < 0.001). Average number of gynecologic ICBT cases per GROR increased, from 39.6 in 2007 to 48.7 in 2018 (p < 0.005). Average number of ISBT cases per GROR decreased, from 34.5 to 20.6 (p < 0.001), due to decreasing prostate volume, from 21.5 to 12 (p < 0.001). Experience with gynecologic ISBT cases remained low at an average of 4.5 cases per year.  Conclusions:   The average number of ICBT cases per GROR has increased, although this does not differentiate between cylinder and tandem-based insertions currently. There has been a steady decline in ISBT experience. These findings may have implications for the development of Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education case minimums for residency programs.""","""['Ashwin Shinde', 'Richard Li', 'Arya Amini', 'Neha Vapiwala', 'Peter Orio rd', 'John A Vargo', 'Catheryn Yashar', 'Yi-Jen Chen', 'Sushil Beriwal', 'Scott Glaser']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Brachytherapy""","""['Resident-reported brachytherapy experience in ACGME-accredited radiation oncology training programs.', 'Temporal Trends of Resident Experience in External Beam Radiation Therapy Cases: Analysis of ACGME Case Logs from 2007 to 2018.', 'Variability in gynecologic case volume of obstetrician-gynecologist residents graduating from 2009 to 2017.', ""Evaluating Coding Accuracy in General Surgery Residents' Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education Procedural Case Logs."", 'Interstitial brachytherapy for gynecologic malignancies: Complications, toxicities, and management.', 'Resident training in brachytherapy in France: A 10-year update after the first survey of SFJRO members.', 'Survey of brachytherapy training experience among radiation oncology trainees and fellows in the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Radiologists (RANZCR).']"""

Nevertheless, uncertainty exists regarding the management of Prostate Imaging-Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) 3 lesions.  Objective:   To investigate whether PI-RADS 3 lesions in combination with clinical parameters, especially prostate-specific antigen density (PSAD), can be used to exclude sPC.  Design, setting, and participants:   A total of 455 consecutive biopsy-naïve men underwent MRI-guided transperineal prostate fusion biopsy at our department between 2017 and 2018. We identified 101 patients who had exclusively one or more PI-RADS 3 lesions on mpMRI. sPC was defined as intermediate- and high-risk PC (according to the D'Amico risk classification).  Outcome measures and statistical analysis:   Univariate logistic regression analysis was performed to test different clinical factors as predictors of sPC in men with PI-RADS 3 lesions. The probability of sPC prediction was calculated for different PSAD thresholds.  Results and limitations:   Among patients with PI-RADS 3 lesions, PSAD was a significant predictor of sPC (p = 0.005). For a PI-RADS score of 3 the probability of excluding sPC was 85% (86/101), which increased to 98% (42/43) when combined with PSAD <0.1 ng/ml/ml.  Conclusions:   Inclusion of PSAD < 0.1 ng/ml/ml in the strategy for biopsy-naïve patients with equivocal mpMRI findings would allow a reduction in prostate biopsies in 43% (43/101) of cases at the cost of missing a very small number (2%, 1/43) of intermediate-risk PCs.  Patient summary:   At high-volume tertiary care centers with significant experience in prostate multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging, immediate biopsies could be safely omitted for men with lesions with a Prostate Imaging-Reporting and Data System score of 3 and prostate-specific antigen density of PSAD < 0.1 ng/ml/ml.

To compare the effects of a group-mediated cognitive behavioral (GMCB) exercise and dietary (EX+D) intervention with those of standard-of-care (SC) treatment on select social cognitive outcomes in prostate cancer (PCa) patients undergoing androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). Methods. In the single-blind, 2-arm, randomized controlled Individualized Diet and Exercise Adherence-Pilot (IDEA-P) trial, 32 PCa patients (mean age = 66.2 years; SD = 7.8) undergoing ADT were randomly assigned to a 12-week EX+D intervention (n = 16) or SC treatment (n = 16). The exercise component of the personalized EX+D intervention integrated a combination of supervised resistance and aerobic exercise performed twice per week. The dietary component involved counseling and education to modify dietary intake and composition. Blinded assessments of social cognitive outcomes were obtained at baseline and 2-month and 3-month follow-up. Results. Intent-to-treat analysis of covariance demonstrated that the EX+D intervention resulted in significantly greater improvements in scheduling (P < .05), coping (P < .01), and exercise self-efficacy (P < .05), and satisfaction with function (P < .01) at 3 months relative to SC. Results of partial correlation analysis also demonstrated that select social cognitive outcomes were significantly correlated with primary trial outcomes of mobility performance and exercise participation (P < .05) at 3-month follow-up. Conclusions: The GMCB lifestyle intervention yielded more favorable improvements in relevant social cognitive outcomes relative to SC among PCa patients undergoing ADT.

Since the animal and cellular models with downregulated or knockout TPPII, p53, SIRT6, SIRT7, and MYBBP1A expression levels demonstrate similar age-related phenotype features, the interaction network was subjected to further investigation. For the identification of the main molecular mechanisms enabling the functions of the interaction network, PIN7 was subjected to the pathway enrichment, protein function prediction, and the protein node prioritization analysis using Cytoscape software and its applications GeneMania, ClusterOne, and Cyto-hubba. The study identified the p53 signaling pathway as the most dominant mediator of PIN7 effect. The top-ranked protein nodes of PIN7 extended by GeneMania application belong to the group of histone acetyltransferases and histone deacetylases. These enzymes are involved in the reverse epigenetic regulation mechanisms linked to the regulation of PTK2, NFκB, and p53 signaling interaction subnetworks of the extended PIN7. The analysis emphasized the role of PTK2 signaling, which functions upstream of the p53 signaling pathway, and its interaction network includes all top rank protein nodes of the extended PIN7 and all members of the sirtuin family (SIRT1-SIRT7). Further, the analysis suggests the involvement of molecular mechanisms related to metastatic cancer (prostate cancer, small cell lung cancer), hemostasis, the regulation of the thyroid hormones, and the cell cycle G1/S checkpoint. The additional data-mining analysis shows that the protein interaction network MYBBP1A-p53-TPPII-SIRT6-CD147 controls the Warburg effect, and MYBBP1A-p53-TPPII-SIRT7-CD147 influences mTOR signaling and autophagy.

To prepare and to subsequently perform a clinical proof-of-concept study on the general suitability of silicon-fluoride-acceptor (SiFA)-conjugated radiopharmaceuticals, we developed inhibitors of the prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) that are labeled by isotopic exchange (IE). To compensate for the pronounced lipophilicity of the SiFA unit, we used metal chelates, conjugated in close proximity to SiFA. Six different radiohybrid PSMA ligands (rhPSMA ligands) were evaluated and compared with the commonly used 18F-PSMA inhibitors 18F-DCFPyL and 18F-PSMA-1007. Methods: All inhibitors were synthesized by solid-phase peptide synthesis. Human serum albumin binding was measured by affinity high-performance liquid chromatography, whereas the lipophilicity of each tracer was determined by the n-octanol/buffer method. In vitro studies (IC50, internalization) were performed on LNCaP cells. Biodistribution studies were conducted on LNCaP tumor-bearing male CB-17 SCID mice. Results: On the laboratory scale (starting activities, 0.2-9.0 GBq), labeling of 18F-rhPSMA-5 to -10 by IE was completed in < 20 min (radiochemical yields, 58% ± 9%; radiochemical purity, >97%) with molar activities of 12-60 GBq/μmol. All rhPSMAs showed low nanomolar affinity and high internalization by PSMA-expressing cells when compared with the reference radiopharmaceuticals, medium-to-low lipophilicity, and high human serum albumin binding. Biodistribution studies in LNCaP tumor-bearing mice revealed high tumor uptake, sufficiently fast clearance kinetics from blood, low hepatobiliary excretion, fast renal excretion, and very low uptake of 18F activity in bone. Conclusion: The novel 18F-rhPSMA radiopharmaceuticals developed under the radiohybrid concept show equal or better targeting characteristics than the established 18F-PSMA tracers 18F-DCFPyL and 18F-PSMA-1007. The unparalleled simplicity of production, the possibility to produce the identical 68Ga-labeled 19F-68Ga-rhPSMA tracers, and the possibility to extend this concept to true theranostic radiohybrid radiopharmaceuticals, such as F-Lu-rhPSMA, are unique features of these radiopharmaceuticals.""","""['Alexander Wurzer', 'Daniel Di Carlo', 'Alexander Schmidt', 'Roswitha Beck', 'Matthias Eiber', 'Markus Schwaiger', 'Hans-Jürgen Wester']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""J Nucl Med""","""['Synthesis and Preclinical Evaluation of 177Lu-Labeled Radiohybrid PSMA Ligands for Endoradiotherapy of Prostate Cancer.', 'Synthesis and pre-clinical evaluation of a new class of high-affinity 18F-labeled PSMA ligands for detection of prostate cancer by PET imaging.', 'Preclinical comparison of four 18F, natGarhPSMA-7 isomers: influence of the stereoconfiguration on pharmacokinetics.', 'Recent advancements in 18F-labeled PSMA targeting PET radiopharmaceuticals.', 'Peptide and pseudo-peptide.', 'Diagnostic value of two-time point 68GaGa-PSMA-11 PET/CT in the primary staging of untreated prostate cancer.', 'Detection efficacy of\xa089ZrZr-PSMA-617 PET/CT in\xa068GaGa-PSMA-11 PET/CT-negative biochemical recurrence of prostate cancer.', 'Organotrifluoroborate enhances tumor targeting of fibroblast activation protein inhibitors for targeted radionuclide therapy.', 'Radiotheranostics in advanced prostate cancer: Current and future directions.', 'Development of the First 18F-Labeled Radiohybrid-Based Minigastrin Derivative with High Target Affinity and Tumor Accumulation by Substitution of the Chelating Moiety.']"""

Methods: We retrospectively analyzed 11C-choline PET/CT scans from 287 patients who were enrolled in an imaging protocol based on rising prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels (mean, 3.43 ng/mL; median, 0.94 ng/mL; range, 0.15-89.91 ng/mL) and suspected recurrent PCa. A total of 187 patients had undergone primary radical prostatectomy (RP) (79/187 had secondary radiotherapy), 30 had undergone primary radiotherapy, and 70 had a persistent PSA elevation after receiving initial treatment (69 after RP, 1 after radiotherapy). The level of suspicion for recurrence on 11C-choline PET/CT was scored (0, negative; 1, equivocal; 2, positive) by 2 readers. The correlation between 11C-choline PET/CT positivity and initial treatment, Gleason score, National Comprehensive Cancer Network stage, PSA level, PSA doubling time, PSA velocity, and time between initial treatment and PET imaging was evaluated. Prostate Cancer Molecular Imaging Standardized Evaluation (PROMISE) criteria were used to map 11C-choline recurrence patterns. Results: Considering scores 1 and 2 as positives, consensus between the 2 readers deemed 66% of the 11C-choline PET/CT scans as positive. When sorted by PSA level, 45% of patients with a PSA of less than 0.5 ng/mL, 56% of patients with a PSA of 0.5-0.99 ng/mL, 70% of patients with a PSA of 1.0-1.99 ng/mL, and 90% of patients with a PSA of at least 2.0 ng/mL scored either 1 or 2 on 11C-choline PET/CT scans. When considering scores of 2 only, 11C-choline PET/CT positivity was 54% (28%, 46%, 62%, and 81%, respectively, for patients with PSA < 0.5 ng/mL, 0.5-0.99 ng/mL, 1.0-1.99 ng/mL, and ≥ 2.0 ng/mL). In multivariate analysis, only PSA level was significantly associated with scan positivity. Pattern analysis showed that pelvic lymph nodes were the most common site of recurrence, and 28% of patients had 11C-choline-positive suspected recurrences outside the initial treatment field. Conclusion:11C-choline PET/CT can detect PCa recurrence even among patients with low PSA levels when interpretation accounts for the clinical context, providing a certain pretest probability.

The model assumes the orderly progression of stem cell divisions requires precise control at every stage in development. If the orderly progression is maintained then cancer will be rare. A prediction of the model is that if the orderly progression of the stem cell hierarchy is disturbed by trauma, ulceration or inflammation then cancer will occur.  Hypothesis:   Bacterial induced inflammation in breast ducts disturbs the stem cell hierarchy and is a cause of breast cancer.  Evidence:   Mammalian milk is not sterile. It contains a range of bacteria, derived endogenously by the entero-mammary circulation. The dominant flora consists of lactose fermenting bacteria. Pregnancy and breast feeding reduce the risk of subsequent breast cancer. The implication is that a lactose fermenting bacterial flora in breast ducts is protective. Malignant and benign breast tissue contains bacteria derived endogenously, but studies so far have not revealed a specific flora associated with malignancy. Periodontitis is associated with oral, oesophageal, colonic, pancreatic, prostatic and breast cancer. The pathogenic bacteria which cause periodontitis spread endogenously to cause inflammation at other epithelial sites. Meta-analysis of epidemiological studies shows that the consumption of yoghurt is associated with a reduction in the risk of breast cancer.  Conclusion:   The hypothesis, although not proven, is supported by the available evidence. Lactose fermenting bacteria protect but pathogenic bacteria which induce inflammation raise the risk of breast cancer. The consumption of yoghurt also appears to be protective.""","""['A K Marwaha', 'J A Morris', 'R J Rigby']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Med Hypotheses""","""[""The hierarchical model of stem cell genesis explains the man mouse paradox, Peto's paradox, the red cell paradox and Wright's enigma."", 'Optimise the microbial flora with milk and yoghurt to prevent disease.', 'In search of a stem cell hierarchy in the human breast and its relevance to breast cancer evolution.', 'The mammary stem cell hierarchy: a looking glass into heterogeneous breast cancer landscapes.', 'The application of probiotic fermented milks in cancer and intestinal inflammation.', 'New Developments and Opportunities of Microbiota in Treating Breast Cancers.', 'Tissue Microbiome Associated With Human Diseases by Whole Transcriptome Sequencing and 16S Metagenomics.']"""

To identify the best candidate solution and for final evaluation a plan quality score (PQS), based on dose volume histogram (DVH) parameters, was introduced. Automatic PSO-based RT planning was used for N = 10 postoperative prostate cancer cases, retrospectively taken from our clinical database, with a prescribed dose of EUD = 66 Gy in addition to two constraints for rectum and one for bladder. Resulting PSO-based plans were compared dosimetrically to manually generated VMAT plans.  Results:   PSO successfully proposed treatment plans comparable to manually optimized ones in 9/10 cases. The median (range) PTV EUD was 65.4 Gy (64.7-66.0) for manual and 65.3 Gy (62.5-65.5) for PSO plans, respectively. However PSO plans achieved significantly lower doses in rectum D2% 67.0 Gy (66.5-67.5) vs. 66.1 Gy (64.7-66.5, p = 0.016). All other evaluated parameters (PTV D98% and D2%, rectum V40Gy and V60Gy, bladder D2% and V60Gy) were comparable in both plans. Manual plans had lower PQS compared to PSO plans with -0.82 (-16.43-1.08) vs. 0.91 (-5.98-6.25).  Conclusion:   PSO allows for fully automatic generation of VMAT plans with plan quality comparable to manually optimized plans.

The San Francisco Health Information National Trends Survey was developed and administered to assess the use of cancer-related information among under-represented populations in San Francisco to provide baseline data for the San Francisco Cancer Initiative.  Methods:   The survey instrument was developed through consultation with research and community partners and translated into 4 languages. Participants were recruited between May and September 2017 through community-based snowball sampling with quotas to ensure adequate numbers of under-represented populations. Chi-square tests and multivariate logistic regression were used between 2018 and 2019 to assess differences in screening rates across groups and factors associated with cancer screening.  Results:   One thousand twenty-seven participants were recruited. Asians had lower rates of lifetime mammogram (p=0.02), Pap test (p<0.01), and prostate-specific antigen test (p=0.04) compared with non-Asians. Hispanics had higher rates of lifetime mammogram (p=0.02), lifetime Pap test (p=0.01), recent Pap test (p=0.03), and lifetime prostate-specific antigen test (p=0.04) compared with non-Hispanics. Being a female at birth was the only factor that was independently associated with cancer screening participation (AOR=3.17, 95% CI=1.40, 7.19).  Conclusions:   Screening adherence varied by race, ethnicity, and screening type. A collaborative, community-based approach led to a large, diverse sample and may serve as a model for recruiting diverse populations to add knowledge about cancer prevention preferences and behaviors. Results suggest targeted outreach efforts are needed to address disparate cancer screening behaviors within this diverse population.""","""['Natalie A Rivadeneira', 'Mekhala Hoskote', 'Gem M Le', 'Tung T Nguyen', 'Anna María Nápoles', 'Rena J Pasick', 'Urmimala Sarkar', 'Robert A Hiatt']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Am J Prev Med""","""['Patient and provider characteristics associated with colorectal, breast, and cervical cancer screening among Asian Americans.', ""Perceived discrimination is associated with reduced breast and cervical cancer screening: the Study of Women's Health Across the Nation (SWAN)."", 'Racial/Ethnic Differences Affecting Adherence to Cancer Screening Guidelines Among Women.', 'Social class, race/ethnicity, and incidence of breast, cervix, colon, lung, and prostate cancer among Asian, Black, Hispanic, and White residents of the San Francisco Bay Area, 1988-92 (United States).', 'Race/Ethnicity and Primary Language: Health Beliefs about Colorectal Cancer Screening in a Diverse, Low-Income Population.', ""Implementation of a novel program to support colorectal cancer screening in a community health center consortium before and after the onset of COVID-19: a qualitative study of stakeholders' perspectives."", 'Cancer Risk Behaviors, Cancer Beliefs, and Health Information Seeking Among Under-Represented Populations in San Francisco: Differences by Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity.', 'Population-Level Patterns of Prostate Cancer Occurrence: Disparities in Virginia.', 'Exploring factors associated with hepatitis B screening in a multilingual and diverse population.', 'From Cancer Epidemiology to Policy and Practice: the Role of a Comprehensive Cancer Center.']"""

In the absence of genotype data this process can lead to ambiguity in data interpretation when a sample has polymorphisms at a methylation probe site. A common way to minimize this problem is to exclude such potentially problematic sites, with some methods removing as much as 60% of array probes from consideration before data analysis.  Results:   Here, we present an algorithm implemented in an R Bioconductor package, MethylToSNP, which detects a characteristic data pattern to infer sites likely to be confounded by polymorphisms. Additionally, the tool provides a stringent reliability score to allow thresholding on SNP predictions. We calibrated parameters and thresholds used by the algorithm on simulated and real methylation data sets. We illustrate findings using methylation data from YRI (Yoruba in Ibadan, Nigeria), CEPH (European descent) and KhoeSan (southern African) populations. Our polymorphism predictions made using MethylToSNP have been validated through SNP databases and bisulfite and genomic sequencing.  Conclusions:   The benefits of this method are threefold. First, it prevents extensive data loss by considering only SNPs specific to the individuals in the study. Second, it offers the possibility to identify new polymorphisms in samples for which there is little known about the genetic landscape. Third, it identifies variants as they exist in functional regions of a genome, such as in CTCF (transcriptional repressor) sites and enhancers, that may be common alleles or personal mutations with potential to deleteriously affect genomic regulatory activities. We demonstrate that MethylToSNP is applicable to the Illumina 450K and Illumina 850K EPIC array data and is also backwards compatible to the 27K methylation arrays. Going forward, this kind of nuanced approach can increase the amount of information derived from precious data sets by considering samples of the project individually to enable more informed decisions about data cleaning.""","""['Brenna A LaBarre', 'Alexander Goncearenco', 'Hanna M Petrykowska', 'Weerachai Jaratlerdsiri', 'M S Riana Bornman', 'Vanessa M Hayes', 'Laura Elnitski']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Epigenetics Chromatin""","""['""Gap hunting"" to characterize clustered probe signals in Illumina methylation array data.', 'Impact of SNPs on methylation readouts by Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip Array: implications for comparative population studies.', 'Critical evaluation of the Illumina MethylationEPIC BeadChip microarray for whole-genome DNA methylation profiling.', 'Monitoring methylation changes in cancer.', 'Improved filtering of DNA methylation microarray data by detection p values and its impact on downstream analyses.', 'Beadchip technology to detect DNA methylation in mouse\xa0faithfully recapitulates whole-genome bisulfite sequencing.', 'Application of third-generation sequencing to herbal genomics.', 'Altered methylation pattern in EXOC4 is associated with stroke outcome: an epigenome-wide association study.', 'Epigenetic signatures relating to disease-associated genotypic burden in familial risk of bipolar disorder.', 'Hibernation slows epigenetic ageing in yellow-bellied marmots.']"""

A basic step in profile construction at transcript level is to map Ribo-seq data to transcripts, and then assign a huge number of multiple-mapped reads to similar isoforms. Existing methods either discard the multiple mapped-reads, or allocate them randomly, or assign them proportionally according to transcript abundance estimated from RNA-seq data.  Results:   Here we present DeepShape, an RNA-seq free computational method to estimate ribosome abundance of isoforms, and simultaneously compute their ribosome profiles using a deep learning model. Our simulation results demonstrate that DeepShape can provide more accurate estimations on both ribosome abundance and profiles when compared to state-of-the-art methods. We applied DeepShape to a set of Ribo-seq data from PC3 human prostate cancer cells with and without PP242 treatment. In the four cell invasion/metastasis genes that are translationally regulated by PP242 treatment, different isoforms show very different characteristics of translational efficiency and regulation patterns. Transcript level ribosome distributions were analyzed by ""Codon Residence Index (CRI)"" proposed in this study to investigate the relative speed that a ribosome moves on a codon compared to its synonymous codons. We observe consistent CRI patterns in PC3 cells. We found that the translation of several codons could be regulated by PP242 treatment.

This conversion is almost invariably described as involving deamidation of l-glutamine to l-glutamate followed by a transaminase (or dehydrogenase) reaction. However, mammalian tissues possess another pathway for conversion of l-glutamine to α-ketoglutarate, namely the glutaminase II pathway: l-Glutamine is transaminated to α-ketoglutaramate, which is then deamidated to α-ketoglutarate by ω-amidase. Here we show that glutamine transaminase and ω-amidase specific activities are high in normal rat prostate. Immunohistochemical analyses revealed that glutamine transaminase K (GTK) and ω-amidase are present in normal and cancerous human prostate and that expression of these enzymes increases in parallel with aggressiveness of the cancer cells. Our findings suggest that the glutaminase II pathway is important in providing anaplerotic carbon to the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, closing the methionine salvage pathway, and in the provision of citrate carbon in normal and cancerous prostate. Finally, our data also suggest that selective inhibitors of GTK and/or ω-amidase may be clinically important for treatment of prostate cancer. In conclusion, the demonstration of a prominent glutaminase II pathway in prostate cancer cells and increased expression of the pathway with increasing aggressiveness of tumor cells provides a new perspective on 'glutamine addiction' in cancers.""","""['Thambi Dorai', 'Bhuvaneswari Dorai', 'John T Pinto', 'Michael Grasso', 'Arthur J L Cooper']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Biomolecules""","""['The metabolic importance of the glutaminase II pathway in normal and cancerous cells.', 'ω-Amidase: an underappreciated, but important enzyme in L-glutamine and L-asparagine metabolism; relevance to sulfur and nitrogen metabolism, tumor biology and hyperammonemic diseases.', 'High activities of glutamine transaminase K (dichlorovinylcysteine beta-lyase) and omega-amidase in the choroid plexus of rat brain.', 'Evidence that glutamine transaminase and omega-amidase potentially act in tandem to close the methionine salvage cycle in bacteria and plants.', 'α-Ketoglutaramate: an overlooked metabolite of glutamine and a biomarker for hepatic encephalopathy and inborn errors of the urea cycle.', 'Dietary Manipulation of Amino Acids for Cancer Therapy.', 'Rethinking glutamine metabolism and the regulation of glutamine addiction by oncogenes in cancer.', 'α-Ketoglutaramate-A key metabolite contributing to glutamine addiction in cancer cells.', 'Druggable Metabolic Vulnerabilities Are Exposed and Masked during Progression to Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Disrupted Alpha-Ketoglutarate Homeostasis: Understanding Kidney Diseases from the View of Metabolism and Beyond.']"""

Both AR and GR have a role in resistance to androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), the mainstay of treatment for late stage prostate cancer. PlexinB1, a receptor for semaphorins, has been implicated in various cancers including prostate cancer and has a role in resistance to ADT. We show here that activation of PlexinB1 by Sema4D and Sema3C results in translocation of endogenous GR to the nucleus in prostate cancer cells, and that this effect is dependent on PlexinB1 expression. Sema4D/Sema3C promotes the translocation of GR-GFP to the nucleus and mutation of the nuclear localization sequence (NLS1) of GR abrogates this response. These findings implicate the importin α/β system in the Sema4D/Sema3C-mediated nuclear import of GR. Knockdown of PlexinB1 in prostate cancer cells decreases the levels of glucocorticoid-responsive gene products and antagonizes the decrease in cell motility and cell area of prostate cancer cells upon dexamethasone treatment, demonstrating the functional significance of these findings.

Cabazitaxel (CBZ) is reported to improve overall survival in patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) after progression observed in regimens including docetaxel. CBZ is known for severe myelosuppression; however there is no recommendation for the treatment of LTBI before CBZ treatment. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first report to describe reactivation of LTBI induced by CBZ.  Patient concerns:   A 75-year-old Japanese male with a medical history of TB since 16 years of age had been treated for prostate cancer (PC) (initial prostate-specific antigen 532 ng/ml; cT4N1M1b; Gleason score4+4) with androgen deprivation therapy, abiraterone, and docetaxel. Calcified nodules and radiological findings of LTBI were present in the upper right lobe since the diagnosis of PC. After progression was observed during these treatments, CBZ was administered combined with pegfilgrastim, long-acting granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF). Seven days after the third course of CBZ, he was admitted to the authors' hospital to treat febrile neutropenia (FN). High fever persisted even after myelosuppression had recovered. Computed tomography (CT) revealed distribution of small nodules in the bilateral lungs, for which miliary TB was included in the differential diagnosis. T-Spot, interferon-gamma-release assay, and bronchoscopy yielded no significant findings; however, sputum and urine culture confirmed the diagnosis of TB.  Diagnosis:   CT, sputum and urine culture confirmed the diagnosis of miliary TB.  Interventions:   The patient was treated with anti-bacterial therapy (cefepime) on hospital admission, which was not effective. After the diagnosis of miliary TB was confirmed, anti-TB drugs, including isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide and ethambutol, were administered.  Outcomes:   Despite anti-TB therapy, high fever persisted and radiological findings worsened. Fifty days after the third course of CBZ, the patient died of respiratory dysfunction caused by progression of miliary TB.

Gold standard for the location of seeds on TRUS data were obtained with the guidance of the complete reconstruction of the seed locations from multiple C-arm fluoroscopy views and used in the creation of the training set. We designed and trained a convolutional neural network (CNN) model that worked on 3D cubical sub-regions of the TRUS images, that will be referred to as patches, representing seed, non-seed within a needle track and non-seed elsewhere in the images. The models were trained with these patches to detect the needle track first and then the individual seeds within the needle track. A leave-one-out cross validation approach was used to test the model on the data from eight of the patients, for whom accurate seed locations were available from fluoroscopic imaging. The total inference time was about 7 min for needle track detection in each patient's image and approximately 1 min for seed detection in each needle, leading to a total seed detection time of less than 15 min.

Results:   The median initial PSA was 33.2 ng/mL (range, 2.4-296 ng/mL), and the median follow-up period was 109 months (range, 11-257 months). The preoperative median ADT period was 4 months (range, 1-20 months). IDC-P was present in 53 patients (37%) in NB samples and 65 (45%) in RP. The patients were divided into three groups based on the presence or absence of IDC-P in NB/RP samples (IDC-P-negative at biopsy: 92 cases, IDC-P-positive at biopsy with IDC-P disappearance: 15 cases, and IDC-P-positive at biopsy with IDC-P persistence: 38 cases). Overall, 28% of IDC-P-positive cases in NB samples showed the disappearance of IDC-P at RP. IDC-P persistence cases showed the poorest prognosis, while IDC-P disappearance cases had a similar prognosis to that of IDC-P-negative at biopsy cases in terms of disease-free survival, cancer-specific survival, and overall survival (P = .0018, P = .0087, and P = .0034, respectively).  Conclusions:   Some cases with IDC-P responded to ADT and demonstrated favorable clinical outcomes similar to those of cases without IDC-P.

Knowing how the potential benefits and harms of screening vary by an individual's risk of developing prostate cancer could inform decision-making about screening at both an individual and population level. This modelling study examined the benefit-harm tradeoffs and the cost-effectiveness of a risk-tailored screening programme compared to age-based and no screening.  Methods and findings:   A life-table model, projecting age-specific prostate cancer incidence and mortality, was developed of a hypothetical cohort of 4.48 million men in England aged 55 to 69 years with follow-up to age 90. Risk thresholds were based on age and polygenic profile. We compared no screening, age-based screening (quadrennial PSA testing from 55 to 69), and risk-tailored screening (men aged 55 to 69 years with a 10-year absolute risk greater than a threshold receive quadrennial PSA testing from the age they reach the risk threshold). The analysis was undertaken from the health service perspective, including direct costs borne by the health system for risk assessment, screening, diagnosis, and treatment. We used probabilistic sensitivity analyses to account for parameter uncertainty and discounted future costs and benefits at 3.5% per year. Our analysis should be considered cautiously in light of limitations related to our model's cohort-based structure and the uncertainty of input parameters in mathematical models. Compared to no screening over 35 years follow-up, age-based screening prevented the most deaths from prostate cancer (39,272, 95% uncertainty interval [UI]: 16,792-59,685) at the expense of 94,831 (95% UI: 84,827-105,630) overdiagnosed cancers. Age-based screening was the least cost-effective strategy studied. The greatest number of quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) was generated by risk-based screening at a 10-year absolute risk threshold of 4%. At this threshold, risk-based screening led to one-third fewer overdiagnosed cancers (64,384, 95% UI: 57,382-72,050) but averted 6.3% fewer (9,695, 95% UI: 2,853-15,851) deaths from prostate cancer by comparison with age-based screening. Relative to no screening, risk-based screening at a 4% 10-year absolute risk threshold was cost-effective in 48.4% and 57.4% of the simulations at willingness-to-pay thresholds of GBP£20,000 (US$26,000) and £30,000 ($39,386) per QALY, respectively. The cost-effectiveness of risk-tailored screening improved as the threshold rose.  Conclusions:   Based on the results of this modelling study, offering screening to men at higher risk could potentially reduce overdiagnosis and improve the benefit-harm tradeoff and the cost-effectiveness of a prostate cancer screening program. The optimal threshold will depend on societal judgements of the appropriate balance of benefits-harms and cost-effectiveness.""","""['Tom Callender', 'Mark Emberton', 'Steve Morris', 'Ros Eeles', 'Zsofia Kote-Jarai', 'Paul D P Pharoah', 'Nora Pashayan']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""PLoS Med""","""['Benefit, Harm, and Cost-effectiveness Associated With Magnetic Resonance Imaging Before Biopsy in Age-based and Risk-stratified Screening for Prostate Cancer.', 'Cost-effectiveness and Benefit-to-Harm Ratio of Risk-Stratified Screening for Breast Cancer: A Life-Table Model.', 'Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Prostate Cancer Screening in the UK: A Decision Model Analysis Based on the CAP Trial.', 'Cost-effectiveness of prostate cancer screening: a systematic review of decision-analytical models.', 'Screening for prostate cancer.', 'Navigating the uncertainty of precision cancer screening: The role of shared decision-making.', 'Perceived benefits and barriers to implementing precision preventive care: Results of a national physician survey.', 'Cost-effectiveness of polygenic risk profiling for primary open-angle glaucoma in the United Kingdom and Australia.', 'CanRisk-Prostate: A Comprehensive, Externally Validated Risk Model for the Prediction of Future Prostate Cancer.', 'Polygenic risk of any, metastatic, and fatal prostate cancer in the Million Veteran Program.']"""

Initial work has demonstrated that alpha-DG expression is decreased in many types of adenocarcinoma, including prostate, and potentially associated with the development of metastatic disease. However, the consistency between prostate and lymph node alpha-DG staining has not been previously reported. In addition, identification of an immunohistochemical marker associated with prostate cancer grade, stage, need for adjuvant or salvage therapy and mortality would have potential clinical value.  Materials and methods:   Node positive, margin negative radical prostatectomy specimens at a single institution from 1982 to 2012 were reviewed and identified 35 prostate specimens, including 26 patients with available tissue from both the primary prostatectomy and lymph node specimens. The expression levels of the alpha-DG subunit were analyzed using immunohistochemistry and graded from 0 to 4. Survival was compared in different staining pattern groups.  Results:   Strength of alpha-DG staining was found to be consistent between prostate and lymph node specimens (p < 0.004). The median overall survival was shorter in those without alpha-DG staining in the prostate compared to those with positive staining, but this difference was not statistically significant (13.2 years versus 19.4 years, p = 0.21). In addition, negative staining was associated with higher mean PSA, pathologic T stage, Gleason grade and the need for adjuvant or salvage therapy compared to positive group but none reached statistical significance (16.06 ng/mL versus 11.67 ng/mL, p = 0.79; 89% versus 68%, p = 0.38; 33.3% versus 23.1%, p = 0.66; 88.9% versus 76.9%, p = 0.44).

However, Enza is not cost-effective (CE) at willingness to pay (WTP) thresholds from $0-$125 000/quality adjusted life years (QALYs) and is therefore a strain on valuable health care dollars. Metformin (Met) is inexpensive (~$8.00/month) and is thought to improve prostate cancer specific and overall survival compared to those not taking Met. We hypothesized that there must be an added effect Met could provide that would make Enza CE thereby alleviating this financial strain on government health care budgets.  Materials and methods:   We constructed a Markov model and performed a threshold analysis to narrow in on the added effect needed to make such a combination therapy cost-effective at various WTP thresholds.  Results:   At a WTP threshold of $50 000/QALY Enza + Met is unlikely to be CE unless it increases Enza's efficacy by more than 30%. At a WTP threshold of $100 000, Enza + Met could be CE barring Met adds 18.73% to the efficacy of Enza.  Conclusions:   Enza + Met is unlikely to be CE at WTP thresholds less than $100 000/QALY; these results make sense because a therapy that is not CE at these WTP thresholds by itself is unlikely to be CE with an adjuvant therapy that keep a patient on such a treatment for even longer. Finally, our model suggests that the mCRPC setting is not the optimal place to trial adding Met as the relative costs are high and utility values low.""","""['Jordan Hill', 'Mike Paulden', 'Christopher McCabe', 'Scott A North', 'Peter Venner', 'Nawaid Usmani']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Can J Urol""","""['Cost-effectiveness model of abiraterone plus prednisone, cabazitaxel plus prednisone and enzalutamide for visceral metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer therapy after docetaxel therapy resistance.', 'New therapeutic options in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer: Can cost-effectiveness analysis help in treatment decisions?', 'Number needed to treat and associated incremental costs of treatment with enzalutamide versus abiraterone acetate plus prednisone in chemotherapy-naïve patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Treatments for Metastatic Prostate Cancer (mPC): A Review of Costing Evidence.', 'Enzalutamide (Xtandi) for patients with metastatic, resistant prostate cancer.', 'One-Way Sensitivity Analysis for Probabilistic Cost-Effectiveness Analysis: Conditional Expected Incremental Net Benefit.']"""

SPECT based dosimetry could be used for deriving dose values for individual voxels, as is the standard in external-beam radiation-therapy (EBRT). For this a time-activity-curve (TAC) at voxel resolution and also a voxel-wise modeling of radiation energy deposition are necessary. But a voxel-wise determination of TACs is problematic, since several confounding factors exist, such as e.g. poor count-statistics or registration inaccuracies, which add noise to the observed activity states. A particle filter (PF) is a class of methods which applies regularization based on a model of the temporal evolution of activity states. The aim of this study is to introduce the application of PFs for de-noising of per-voxel time-activity curves.  Methods:   We applied a PF for de-noising the TACs of 26 patients, who underwent 177Lu-DOTATOC or -PSMA therapy. The TACs were obtained from fully-quantitative, serial SPECT(/CT) data, acquired at 4h, 24h, 48h, 72h p.i. The model used in the PF was a mono-exponential decay and its free parameters were determined based on objective criteria. The time-integrated activities (TIA) resulting from the PF (PFF) were compared to the results of a mono-exponential fit (SF) of individual voxels in several volumes of interest (kidneys, spleen, tumors). Additionally, an organ-averaged TIA was derived from whole-organ VOIs and subsequent curve-fitting. This whole-organ TIA was also compared to the whole-organ TIAs obtained from summation of the voxel-wise TIAs from PFF and SF.  Results:   The number of particles was set to 1000. Optimal values for noise of observations and noise of the model were 0.25 and 0.5, respectively. The deviation of whole-organ TIAs from conventional organ-based dosimetry and the summation of the voxel-wise TIAs was substantial for SF (kidneys -22.3%, spleen -49.6%, tumor -60.0%), as well as for PFF (kidneys -37.1%, spleen -57.9%, tumor -70.9%). The distribution of voxel-wise half-lives resulting from the PFF method was considerably closer to the organ-averaged value, and the number of implausibly long half-lives (>physical HL) was reduced.  Conclusion:   The PFF leads to voxel-wise half-lives, which are more plausible than those resulting from SF. However, one has to admit that voxel-wise fitting generally leads to considerable deviations from the organ-averaged TIA as obtained by conventional whole-organ evaluation. Unfortunately, we did not have ground-truth TIA of our patient data and proper ground-truth could even be impossible to obtain. Nevertheless, there are strong indicators that particle filtering can be used for reducing voxel-wise TAC noise.""","""['Theresia I Götz', 'Elmar W Lang', 'Christian Schmidkonz', 'Andreas Maier', 'Torsten Kuwert', 'Philipp Ritt']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Z Med Phys""","""['Three-dimensional Monte Carlo-based voxel-wise tumor dosimetry in patients with neuroendocrine tumors who underwent 177Lu-DOTATOC therapy.', 'A comparison of methods for adapting Formula: see text dose-voxel-kernels to tissue inhomogeneities.', 'Accuracy of kidney dosimetry performed using simplified time activity curve modelling methods: a 177Lu-DOTATATE patient study.', 'Radiopharmaceuticals for the Diagnosis and Therapy of Neuroendocrine Differentiated Prostate Cancer.', 'Patient-specific dosimetry in peptide receptor radionuclide therapy: a clinical review.', 'Three-dimensional Monte Carlo-based voxel-wise tumor dosimetry in patients with neuroendocrine tumors who underwent 177Lu-DOTATOC therapy.']"""

Recently, the role of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) in tumor progression has been well concerned by numerous researchers. In this research, lncRNA TTN-AS1 was studied to identify its biological function in the progression of prostate cancer.  Patients and methods:   Firstly, Real Time-quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-qPCR) was conducted to measure TTN-AS1 expression in prostate cancer tissues. Furthermore, in vitro role of TTN-AS1 in regulating prostate cancer cells was assessed. Tumor formation assay was conducted in NOD/SCID mice to explore the in vitro function of TTN-AS1. In addition, the luciferase reporter gene assay was performed to analyze the relationship between TTN-AS1 and miR-1271.  Results:   TTN-AS1 expression was remarkably higher in prostate cancer samples compared with that of corresponding ones. Moreover, proliferation and migration of prostate cancer cells were inhibited after TTN-AS1 was silenced. MiR-1271 was upregulated after the silence of TTN-AS1.

The major drawback is the long examination time and application of gadolinium enhancer. The aim of this study is to analyze (i) the performance of WB-MRI versus the BS and (ii) the diagnostic benefit of gadolinium (WB-MRI + Gd) compared to a non-enhanced protocol (NE WB-MRI).  Methods and materials:   1256 eligible WB-MRI scans were analyzed retrospectively with a single inclusion criterion, a clinical 12-month follow-up or a biopsy as ground truth. N = 285 patients received both a WB-MRI and a BS within 12 months. All the patients were imaged with a coronal T1w and a STIR, and n = 528 (42%) received an additional T1w-mDixon with gadoteridol (0.1 mmol Gd-DTPA/kg).  Results:   From 1256 eligible patients, n = 884 (70%) had breast cancer as a primary disease, n = 101(8%) prostate cancer, and n = 77(6%) lung cancer. The sensitivity (Se) and negative predictive value (NPV) of the WB-MRI was 98/99%, significantly higher compared to BS with 82/89%, P < 0.001 Mc Nemar's test. The specificity (Spe) and positive predictive value (PPV) of the WB-MRI and BS was 85/82% and 91/86%, respectively. The interobserver agreement between WB-MRI and BS was 71%, Cohen's kappa 0.42. Analysis of the added diagnostic value of gadolinium revealed Se/Spe/PPV/NPV of 98/93/92/98% for the NE WB-MRI and 99/93/85/100% for the WM-MRI + Gd, P > 0.05 binary logistic regression with Fischer's exact test.

Docetaxel is a chemotherapeutic drug commonly used in CRPC patients. However, docetaxel-based chemotherapy usually causes docetaxel resistance, partially due to the resistance of CRPC cells to docetaxel-induced apoptosis. Here, we report that the deubiquitinating enzyme ubiquitin-specific protease 33 (USP33) inhibits docetaxel-induced apoptosis of prostate cancer cells, including androgen-independent prostate cancer cells. USP33 is overexpressed in prostate cancer cells and tissues. We found that knockdown or knockout of USP33 enhanced docetaxel-induced apoptosis of prostate cancer cells, accompanied by increased phosphorylation of the cJUN NH2-terminal kinase (JNK). After blocking docetaxel-induced JNK activation using the JNK inhibitor SP600125 or siRNA targeting JNK, the USP33 knockout-enhanced apoptosis was reversed. Furthermore, we found that USP33 could interact with the phosphatase DUSP1 to negatively regulate the activation of JNK, while USP33 knockdown promoted the proteasomal degradation of DUSP1. Mechanistically, we found that USP33 could inhibit the Lys48 (K48)-linked polyubiquitination of DUSP1. More importantly, DUSP1 overexpression could reverse the USP33 knockdown-induced JNK activation and apoptosis in docetaxel-treated prostate cancer cells. Therefore, USP33 overexpression in prostate cancer may contribute to docetaxel resistance by inhibiting the degradation of its partner DUSP1, leading to impaired JNK activation and apoptosis. Our study suggests that USP33-DUSP1-JNK may be a key signalling module mediating the docetaxel resistance of CRPC, indicating that USP33 is a potential novel therapeutic target in CRPC.""","""['Fei Guo#', 'Chao Zhang#', 'Fubo Wang#', 'Wei Zhang', 'Xiaolei Shi', 'Yasheng Zhu', 'Ziyu Fang', 'Bo Yang', 'Yinghao Sun']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Cell Death Differ""","""['NPRL2 promotes docetaxel chemoresistance in castration resistant prostate cancer cells by regulating autophagy through the mTOR pathway.', 'Cdc20/p55 mediates the resistance to docetaxel in castration-resistant prostate cancer in a Bim-dependent manner.', 'Codelivery of GRP78 siRNA and docetaxel via RGD-PEG-DSPE/DOPA/CaP nanoparticles for the treatment of castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Exploitation of the Androgen Receptor to Overcome Taxane Resistance in Advanced Prostate Cancer.', 'Emerging targets to monitor and overcome docetaxel resistance in castration resistant prostate cancer (review).', 'USP33 promotes pancreatic cancer malignant phenotype through the regulation of TGFBR2/TGFβ signaling pathway.', 'A mechanism study of DUSP1 in inhibiting malignant progression of endometrial carcinoma by regulating ERK/AP-1 axis and dephosphorylation of EPHA2.', 'Deubiquitinase USP33 promotes the glycolysis and growth of osteosarcoma by modifying PFKFB3 ubiquitination and degradation.', 'Ubiquitin specific peptidases and prostate cancer.', 'Cellular mechanisms and molecular pathways linking bitter taste receptor signalling to cardiac inflammation, oxidative stress, arrhythmia and contractile dysfunction in heart diseases.']"""

Unfortunately, patients tend to enter a stage called castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) despite the initial response to castration. For various reasons, AR signaling is reactivated in CRPC. As such, AR signaling inhibitors, such as enzalutamide, has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration to treat CRPC in the clinic. However, the limited success of these new drugs suggests an immediate unmet need to understand the underlying mechanisms for resistance so novel targets can be identified to enhance their efficacy.  Methods:   An unbiased bioinformatics analysis was performed with the existing human patient dataset and RNA-seq results of in-house PCa cell lines to identify new targets to overcome enzalutamide resistance. Cell viability and growth were detected by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide and colony formation assay. Cell invasion and migration were detected by transwell assay. Protein levels were detected by Western blot or immunofluorescence.  Results:   We found that the noncanonical Wnt signaling was activated in enzalutamide-resistant PCa cells and that the activation of noncanonical Wnt signaling was correlated with AR expression and disease progression. This was validated by the elevated expression of noncanonical Wnt pathway members such as Wnt5a, RhoA, and ROCK in enzalutamide-resistant PCa cells in comparison to their enzalutamide-sensitive counterparts. And, both Y27632, an inhibitor of ROCK, and depletion of ROCK enhanced the efficacy of enzalutamide in enzalutamide-resistant PCa cells. Of significance, a combination of Y27632 and enzalutamide inhibited 22RV1-derived xenograft tumor growth synergistically. Finally, ROCK depletion plus enzalutamide treatment inhibited invasion and migration of enzalutamide-resistant PCa cells via inhibition of epithelial-mesenchymal transition.

To circumvent the non-identifiability problem inherent in the age-period-cohort model, additional constraints are necessary on the parameters estimates. We propose setting the constraint to reflect the different nature of the three temporal variables: age, period, and birth cohort. There are two assumptions in our method. Recognizing age effects to be deterministic (first assumption), we do not explicitly incorporate the age parameters into constraint. For the stochastic period and cohort effects, we set a constant-relative-variation constraint on their trends (second assumption). The constant-relative-variation constraint dictates that between two stochastic effects, one with a larger curvature gets a larger (absolute) slope, and one with zero curvature gets no slope. We conducted Monte-Carlo simulations to examine the statistical properties of the proposed method and analyzed the data of prostate cancer incidence for whites from 1973-2012 to illustrate the methodology. A driver for the period and/or cohort effect may be lacking in some populations. In that case, the CRV method automatically produces an unbiased age effect and no period and/or cohort effect, thereby addressing the situation properly. However, the method proposed in this paper is not a general purpose model and will produce biased results in many other real-life data scenarios. It is only useful in situations when the age effects are deterministic and dominant, and the period and cohort effects are stochastic and minor.""","""['Shih-Yung Su', 'Wen-Chung Lee']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['A simulation study of control sampling methods for nested case-control studies of genetic and molecular biomarkers and prostate cancer progression.', 'A heuristic solution of the identifiability problem of the age-period-cohort analysis of cancer occurrence: lung cancer example.', 'Preventing bias from selective non-response in population-based survey studies: findings from a Monte Carlo simulation study.', 'Applications of Monte Carlo Simulation in Modelling of Biochemical Processes.', 'Addressing the identification problem in age-period-cohort analysis: a tutorial on the use of partial least squares and principal components analysis.', 'Epidemiology of Chronic Hepatitis B Infection in the Cohort of College Students with Vaccination in Taiwan.', 'Incidence trends and spatial distributions of lung adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma in Taiwan.', 'Association of Nationwide Hepatitis B Vaccination and Antiviral Therapy Programs With End-Stage Liver Disease Burden in Taiwan.']"""

Bone scan index (BSI) is defined as the percentage of total amount of bone metastasis on whole-body scintigraphic images. We present a specific software (DASciS) developed by an engineering team of ""Sapienza"" University of Rome for BSI calculation. Patients and methods 127 mCRPC patients bone scan images were processed with DASciS software, and BSI was tested as OS predictor. Results 546 bone scans were analyzed revealing that the extension of disease is a predictor of OS (0-3% = 28 months of median survival (MoMS]; 3%-5% = 11 MoMS, > 5% = 5 MoMS). BSI has been analyzed as a single parameter for OS, determining an 88% AUC. Moreover, the composition between the BSI and the 3-PS (3-variable prognostic score) determines a remarkable improvement of the AUC (91%), defining these two parameters as the best OS predictors. Conclusions This study suggests that OS is inversely correlated with the load of bone disease in mCRPC Ra-223-treated subjects. DASciS software appears a promising tool in identifying mCRPC patients that more likely take advantage from Ra-223 treatment.

This model assigns screen-detected cases dying from other causes as overdetection modeled by a one-jump process, which may not be true for the censored overdetected cases. To relax this restrictive assumption, accommodate a finite Markov process for overdetection, and dispense with long-term follow-up until death, we propose a generalized Coxian phase-type Markov process to distinguish the progressive latent multistate pathway from the nonprogressive (overdetected) latent multistate pathway. Various new likelihood functions were developed to estimate the transition parameters with the available data accrued at the time of diagnosis. The proportion of overdetected cancers by the cured model was further estimated by using parameters with and without distinguishing between the two latent pathways. While perturbation analyses were conducted by changing their parameters to assess their effects on overdetection, the results, including of asymptotic analyses, were very robust for an overdetection rate higher than 20% but not for low overdetection rates. These two scenarios were demonstrated by applying the Coxian phase-type model to prostate cancer and breast cancer screening, yielding a substantial proportion of overdetected prostate cancer (60%) attributed to the prostate specific antigen test and a small fraction of overdetected breast cancer (3%) detected by mammography. This kind of variation in overdetection elucidated by the Coxian phase-type Markov process provides new insights into the quantitative mechanisms producing overdetection, which is informative for evaluating the benefits and risks of various types of population-based cancer screening programs.""","""['Amy Ming-Fang Yen', 'Hsiu-Hsi Chen']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Stat Med""","""['Effects of study methods and biases on estimates of invasive breast cancer overdetection with mammography screening: a systematic review.', ""People's willingness to accept overdetection in cancer screening: population survey."", 'Number of screens for overdetection as an indicator of absolute risk of overdiagnosis in prostate cancer screening.', 'Overdetection of Breast Cancer.', 'Detection of latent prostate cancer from routine screening: comparison with breast cancer screening.', 'Assessing overdiagnosis of fecal immunological test screening for colorectal cancer with a digital twin approach.', 'Multistate models for the natural history of cancer progression.', 'A pre-symptomatic incubation model for precision strategies of screening, quarantine, and isolation based on imported COVID-19 cases in Taiwan.', 'Sojourn-time-corrected receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) for prostate specific antigen (PSA) test in population-based prostate cancer screening.']"""

A total of 81,122 men who had undergone annual medical examinations at the First Affiliated Hospital of Army Medical University between 1 January 2011 and 31 December 2018 were included. Univariate and multivariate linear regression models were used to assess the relationship between BMI and PSA concentrations. The nonlinear relationship was analyzed using a generalized additive model with a spline smoothing function. Subsequently, a stratified linear regression model was used for subgroup analysis. The mean age and BMI of the participants were 45.91 ± 12.21 years and 24.79 ± 3.11 kg/m2, respectively. After adjustment for age, waist circumference-hip circumference ratio, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, fasting blood glucose, total cholesterol, triglyceride, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase, BMI was negatively related to PSA level (p < .001). A nonlinear relationship was detected, and different relationships between BMI and PSA concentrations were observed on each side of the inflection point (BMI = 23.11 kg/m2). Our study revealed an inverse, nonlinear relationship between BMI and PSA concentrations. Thus, this relationship may be a concern when establishing reference intervals or decision limits for PSA concentrations.""","""['Ying Zhao', 'Yuting Zhang', 'Xin Wang', 'Dandan Lin', 'Zongtao Chen']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Scand J Clin Lab Invest""","""['Body mass index in relation to prostate-specific antigen-related parameters.', 'A comparative research on obesity hypertension by the comparisons and associations between waist circumference, body mass index with systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and the clinical laboratory data between four special Chinese adult groups.', 'Clinical, anthropometric, metabolic and insulin profile of men with fast annual growth rates of benign prostatic hyperplasia.', 'Obesity inversely correlates with prostate-specific antigen levels in a population with normal screening results of prostate cancer in northwestern China.', 'AST to ALT ratio and arterial stiffness in non-fatty liver Japanese population:a secondary analysis based on a cross-sectional study.', 'Association between Serum Triglycerides and Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) among U.S. Males: National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), 2003-2010.', 'Association of Total Dietary Intake of Sugars with Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA) Concentrations: Evidence from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), 2003-2010.']"""

Patients and methods:   Patients with advanced solid or hematologic malignancies were enrolled in dose-finding and cohort expansion phases. In dose-finding, once-daily or twice-daily (BID) ascending oral doses of CC-115 (range: 0.5-40 mg/day) in 28-day continuous cycles identified the maximum-tolerated dose for cohort expansion in 5 specified tumor types. Twelve additional patients with mixed solid tumors participated in a bioavailability substudy.  Results:   Forty-four patients were enrolled in the dose-finding cohort. Dose-limiting toxicity included thrombocytopenia, stomatitis, hyperglycemia, asthenia/fatigue, and increased transaminases. CC-115 10 mg BID was selected for cohort expansion (n=74) in which fatigue, nausea, and decreased appetite were the most frequent toxicities. Dose-proportional PK was found. CC-115 distributed to glioblastoma tissue (mean tumor/plasma concentration ratio: 0.713). Total exposure of CC-115 was similar under fasting and fed conditions. A patient with endometrial carcinoma remained in complete remission >4 years. Partial response (PR; n=2) and stable disease (SD; n=4) were reported in the bioavailability substudy; SD was reached in 53%, 22%, 21%, and 64% of patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, Ewing sarcoma, glioblastoma multiforme, and castration-resistant prostate cancer, respectively. Chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma showed 38% PR and 25% SD.  Conclusion:   CC-115 was well-tolerated, with toxicities consistent with mTOR inhibitors.

A major limitation of these therapies is inherent or acquired drug resistance. A key to improved outcome of taxane-based therapies is to develop tools to predict and monitor drug efficacy and resistance in the clinical setting allowing for treatment and dose stratification for individual patients. To assess treatment efficacy up to the level of drug target engagement, we have established several formats of tubulin-specific Cellular Thermal Shift Assays (CETSAs). This technique was evaluated in breast and prostate cancer models and in a cohort of breast cancer patients. Here we show that taxanes induce significant CETSA shifts in cell lines as well as in animal models including patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models. Furthermore, isothermal dose response CETSA measurements allowed for drugs to be rapidly ranked according to their reported potency. Using multidrug resistant cancer cell lines and taxane-resistant PDX models we demonstrate that CETSA can identify taxane resistance up to the level of target engagement. An imaging-based CETSA format was also established, which in principle allows for taxane target engagement to be accessed in specific cell types in complex cell mixtures. Using a highly sensitive implementation of CETSA, we measured target engagement in fine needle aspirates from breast cancer patients, revealing a range of different sensitivities. Together, our data support that CETSA is a robust tool for assessing taxane target engagement in preclinical models and clinical material and therefore should be evaluated as a prognostic tool during taxane-based therapies.""","""['Anette Langebäck', 'Smaranda Bacanu', 'Henriette Laursen', 'Lisanne Mout', 'Takahiro Seki', 'Sigrun Erkens-Schulze', 'Anderson Daniel Ramos', 'Anna Berggren', 'Yihai Cao', 'Johan Hartman', 'Wytske van Weerden', 'Jonas Bergh', 'Pär Nordlund', 'Sara Lööf']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Sci Rep""","""['Combination Treatment with Orlistat-Containing Nanoparticles and Taxanes Is Synergistic and Enhances Microtubule Stability in Taxane-Resistant Prostate Cancer Cells.', 'Taxane resistance in breast cancer: mechanisms, predictive biomarkers and circumvention strategies.', 'Taxane resistance in prostate cancer is mediated by decreased drug-target engagement.', 'Live Imaging to Study Microtubule Dynamic Instability in Taxane-resistant Breast Cancers.', 'Activity of ixabepilone in patients with metastatic breast cancer with primary resistance to taxanes.', 'Phenotype-based screening rediscovered benzopyran-embedded microtubule inhibitors as anti-neuroinflammatory agents by modulating the tubulin-p65 interaction.', 'Monitoring drug-target interactions through target engagement-mediated amplification on arrays and in\xa0situ.', 'SILAC-based chemoproteomics reveals a neoligan analogue as an anti-inflammatory agent targeting IRGM to ameliorate cytokine storm.', 'Current Advances in CETSA.', 'Metalloprotease Gp63-Targeting Novel Glycoside Exhibits Potential Antileishmanial Activity.']"""

Design:   All prostate MRI examinations performed between 2016 and 2018 were retrospectively reviewed.  Setting:   University hospital in Japan.  Participants:   Data derived from 334 pathology-proven cases (male, mean age: 70 years; range: 35-90 years) that were interpreted by 10 experienced radiologists were subjected to the analysis.  Primary and secondary outcome measures:   Diagnostic performance measures of the radiologists were compared with candidate factors, including interpretive volume of prostate MRIs, volume of self-directed and assigned total annual interpretive work, and years of experience. The potential influence of fatigue was also evaluated by examining the effect of the report's issue time.  Results:   There were 186 prostate cancer cases. Performance was based on accuracy, sensitivity and specificity (86%, 85% and 84%, respectively). While performance was not correlated with the volume of prostate MRIs, per se (ρ=-0.15, p=0.69; ρ=-0.01, p=0.99; ρ=-0.33, p=0.36) or the total MRIs assigned for each radiologist (p>0.6) or years of experience (p>0.4), all measures were strongly correlated with voluntary work represented by the interpretive volume of abdominal CTs (r=0.79, p<0.01; r=0.80, p<0.01; r=0.64, p=0.048). The performance did not differ based on the issue time of the report (morning, afternoon and evening) (χ2(2)=3.65, p=0.16).  Conclusions:   Greater autonomy, represented as enhanced self-directed interpretive work, was most significantly correlated with the performance of prostate MRI interpretation. The lack of a correlation between the performance and assigned volume confirms the complexity of human learning.

The clinical presentation of primary lymphoma of the prostate is non-specific and it is difficult to distinguish from other prostatic diseases. The primary prostate IVLBCL is very rare, the diagnosis and treatment of which remains unclear. We reported a rare case to explore the diagnosis and treatment for the primary prostate IVLBCL.  Patients concerns:   This report described a case of a 71-year-old male diagnosed as primary prostate IVLBCL who presented with prostatic hyperplasia.  Diagnosis:   The patient first visited an outpatient clinic of urinary surgery because of urinary urgency and frequency and was diagnosed as benign prostatic hyperplasia in about January 2010. Four years later, the symptoms worsened quickly within two months. The diagnosis was still prostatic hyperplasia according to the physical examination and imaging. However, histopathology showed IVLBCL of prostate after transurethral resection of the prostate.  Interventions:   With the clear diagnosis of primary prostate stage I IVLBCL, the patient received immunochemotherapy of R-CHOP (rituximab, cyclophosphamide, adriamycin, vincristine, and prednisolone) for 4 cycles and intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) including the region of prostate with the dose of 45Gy/25f.  Outcomes:   The response was complete remission after all treatment. The last follow-up time of the patient was June 20th, 2019, and no evidence of disease progression was observed. The progression-free survival of the patient was about 49 months until now.  Lessons:   The biopsy of prostate by prostatectomy plays an important role in the diagnosis and removal of the original lesion of primary prostate lymphoma. There is no consensus on therapeutic modalities for the treatment of primary prostate IVLBCL till now. Individual treatments include immunochemotherapy and/or radiotherapy according to the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) practice guideline of diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) based on the performance status and tumor staging of the patient.

However, limited empirical evidence is available on its use by decision-makers; where available, it only comes from single-setting exercises, while cross-country comparative studies are unavailable. This study applies the Advance Value Framework (AVF), an MCDA methodology for HTA based on multi-attribute value theory, through a series of case studies with decision-makers in four countries, to explore its feasibility and compare decision-makers' value preferences and results. The AVF was applied in the evaluation of three drugs for metastatic, castrate resistant, prostate cancer (abiraterone, cabazitaxel and enzalutamide) in the post-chemotherapy indication. Decision conferences were organised in four European countries in collaboration with their HTA or health insurance organisations by involving relevant assessors and experts: Sweden (TLV), Andalusia/Spain (AETSA), Poland (AOTMiT) and Belgium (INAMI-RIZIV). Participants' value preferences, including performance scoring and criteria weighting, were elicited through a facilitated decision-analysis modelling approach using the MACBETH technique. Between 6 and 11 criteria were included in each jurisdiction's value model, allocated across four criteria domains; Therapeutic Benefit criteria consistently ranked first in relative importance across all countries. Consistent drug rankings were observed in all settings, with enzalutamide generating the highest overall weighted preference value (WPV) score, followed by abiraterone and cabazitaxel. Dividing drugs' overall WPV scores by their costs produced the lowest ""cost per unit of value"" for enzalutamide, followed by abiraterone and cabazitaxel.

Methods:   This retrospective study enrolled 153 patients who underwent prostate mpMRI for the purpose of targeted biopsy; patients were divided into a group with clinically significant prostate cancer (csPCa, Gleason score ≥ 3 + 4, n = 89) and a group with non-csPCa (n = 64). Ten inexperienced radiologists retrospectively evaluated these cases (single reader per case) twice using structured reports, and they were blinded to the pathologic results. Initially, the readers interpreted mpMRI without CAD. Six weeks later, they evaluated the same cases again with CAD assistance. At each time of image interpretation, lesions detected by the readers were marked on the prostate vector map in structured reports, and a PI-RADS score was given to each lesion. Diagnostic efficacy and reading time were evaluated for the two reading sessions.  Results:   With the assistance of CAD, the overall diagnostic efficacy was improved, i.e., the AUC increased from 0.83 to 0.89 (p = 0.018). Specifically, per-patient sensitivity (84.3% vs. 93.3%) and per-lesion sensitivity (76.7% vs. 88.8%) were significantly improved (all p < 0.05). Per-patient specificity with CAD (65.6%) was higher than that without CAD (56.3%), but statistical significance was not reached (p = 0.238). The reading time for each case decreased from 10.9 min to 7.8 min (p < 0.001).  Conclusions:   It is feasible to integrate CAD with structured reports of prostate mpMRI. This reading paradigm can improve the diagnostic sensitivity of csPCa detection and reduce reading time among inexperienced radiologists.""","""['Lina Zhu', 'Ge Gao', 'Yi Liu', 'Chao Han', 'Jing Liu', 'Xiaodong Zhang', 'Xiaoying Wang']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Clin Imaging""","""['Computer-aided diagnosis prior to conventional interpretation of prostate mpMRI: an international multi-reader study.', 'Association Between Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) Score for the Index Lesion and Multifocal, Clinically Significant Prostate Cancer.', 'A concurrent, deep learning-based computer-aided detection system for prostate multiparametric MRI: a performance study involving experienced and less-experienced radiologists.', 'The Use of Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging (mpMRI) in the Detection, Evaluation, and Surveillance of Clinically Significant Prostate Cancer (csPCa).', 'What Is the Negative Predictive Value of Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging in Excluding Prostate Cancer at Biopsy?

In vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrated that miR-191 overexpression promotes radiation survival, and contributes to a more aggressive phenotype. Retinoid X receptor alpha, RXRA, was discovered to be a novel target of miR-191, and knockdown recapitulated radioresistance. Furthermore, treatment of prostate cancer cells with the RXRA agonist 9-cis-retinoic acid restored radiosensitivity. Supporting this relationship, patients with high miR-191 and low RXRA abundance experienced quicker biochemical recurrence. Reduced RXRA translated to a higher risk of distant failure after radiotherapy.

However, some reports have also revealed that JQ1 can activate additional oncogenic pathways and may affect epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Therefore, it is important to address the potential unexpected effect of JQ1 treatment, such as cell invasion and metastasis. Here, we showed that in prostate cancer, JQ1 inhibited cancer cell growth but promoted invasion and metastasis in a BET protein-independent manner. Multiple invasion pathways including EMT, bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling, chemokine signaling, and focal adhesion were activated by JQ1 to promote invasion. Notably, JQ1 induced upregulation of invasion genes through inhibition of Forkhead box protein A1 (FOXA1), an invasion suppressor in prostate cancer. JQ1 directly interacted with FOXA1 and inactivated FOXA1 binding to its interacting repressors TLE3, HDAC7, and NFIC, thereby blocking FOXA1-repressive function and activating the invasion genes. Our findings indicate that JQ1 has an unexpected effect of promoting invasion in prostate cancer. Thus, the ill effect of JQ1 or its derived therapeutic agents cannot be ignored during cancer treatment, especially in FOXA1-related cancers.""","""['Leiming Wang', 'Mafei Xu', 'Chung-Yang Kao', 'Sophia Y Tsai', 'Ming-Jer Tsai']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""J Clin Invest""","""['Targeting MYC as a Therapeutic Intervention for Anaplastic Thyroid Cancer.', 'Stromal remodeling by the BET bromodomain inhibitor JQ1 suppresses the progression of human pancreatic cancer.', 'Identification of a stemness-related gene panel associated with BET inhibition in triple negative breast cancer.', 'Pioneer of prostate cancer: past, present and the future of FOXA1.', 'BET bromodomain inhibitors--a novel epigenetic approach in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Super-enhancers complexes zoom in transcription in cancer.', 'Design, synthesis, and docking studies of novel pyrazole-based scaffolds and their evaluation as VEGFR2 inhibitors in the treatment of prostate cancer.', 'The molecular consequences of androgen activity in the human breast.', 'The Role of Cytoskeleton Protein 4.1 in Immunotherapy.', 'To bind or not to bind: Cistromic reprogramming in prostate cancer.']"""

Through mass cytometry and single-cell RNA sequencing, we identified a unique population of CD73hi macrophages in glioblastoma multiforme that persists after anti-PD-1 treatment. To test if targeting CD73 would be important for a successful combination strategy in glioblastoma multiforme, we performed reverse translational studies using CD73-/- mice.

Methods:   One hundred eighteen consecutive patients (50 HR, 68 BCR) had management plans documented at a multidisciplinary meeting before 68Ga-THP-PSMA PET-CT. Patients underwent PET-CT scans 60-min post-injection of 68Ga-THP-PSMA (mean 159 ± 21.2 MBq). Post-scan management plans, Gleason score, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and PSA doubling time (PSAdt) were recorded.  Results:   HR group: 12/50 (24%) patients had management changed (9 inter-modality, 3 intra-modality). Patients with PSA < 20 μg/L had more frequent management changes (9/26, 34.6%) compared with PSA > 20 μg/L (3/24, 12.5%).

This study examines the association between dietary fiber intake and bladder cancer risk among participants in the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial. A total of 101 721 participants were included in this study as they completed both the baseline questionnaire and the diet history questionnaire (cancer free before completion of the diet history questionnaire). Hazard ratios (HRs) and the corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated using the Cox proportional hazards regression model. After a median of 12.5 years of follow-up, 776 new cases of bladder cancer were identified. Higher intake of total fiber, insoluble fiber and soluble fiber were not significantly associated with a reduced risk of bladder cancer. The multi-adjusted HRs (95 CIs) of highest versus lowest tertile of intake were 0.83 (0.66-1.04) for total fiber (P for trend = 0.098), 0.83 (95% CI: 0.67-1.03) for insoluble fiber (P for trend = 0.092) and 0.86 (95% CI: 0.68-1.08) for soluble fiber (P for trend = 0.168), respectively. There was no significant interaction of potential confounders, including education, body mass index and smoking status, with total fiber intake on bladder cancer risk. In summary, the findings of this prospective study show that there is no obvious evidence for a link between dietary fiber consumption and bladder cancer risk.

In this study, we demonstrated that cell growth of androgen-sensitive LNCaP cells could be inhibited 33% by 5 μM kaempferol, around 60% by 10 μM kaempferol, and almost 100% by 15 μM kaempferol. Also, kaempferol showed relatively limited effect on PC-3 cells and nonmalignant RWPE-1 cells. In the presence of DHT, the IC50 for kaempferol was 28.8 ± 1.5 μM in LNCaP cells, 58.3 ± 3.5 μM in PC-3 cells, and 69.1 ± 1.2 μM in RWPE-1 cells, respectively. Kaempferol promotes apoptosis of LNCaP cells in a dose-dependent manner in the presence of dihydrotestosterone (DHT). Then, luciferase assay data showed that kaempferol could inhibit the activation of androgen receptors induced by DHT significantly. The downstream targets of androgen receptors, such as PSA, TMPRSS2, and TMEPA1, were found decreased in the presence of kaempferol in qPCR data. It was then confirmed that the protein level of PSA was decreased. Kaempferol inhibits AR protein expression and nuclear accumulation. Kaempferol suppressed vasculogenic mimicry of PC-3 cells in an in vitro study. In conclusion, kaempferol is a promising therapeutic candidate for treatment of prostate cancer, where the androgen signaling pathway as well as vasculogenic mimicry are involved.""","""['Jun Da', 'Mingxi Xu', 'Yiwei Wang', 'Wenfeng Li', 'Mujun Lu', 'Zhong Wang']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Anal Cell Pathol (Amst)""","""['6-(3,4-Dihydro-1H-isoquinoline-2-yl)-N-(6-methoxypyridine-2-yl) nicotinamide-26 (DIMN-26) decreases cell proliferation by induction of apoptosis and downregulation of androgen receptor signaling in human prostate cancer cells.', '5alpha-androstane-3alpha,17beta-diol supports human prostate cancer cell survival and proliferation through androgen receptor-independent signaling pathways: implication of androgen-independent prostate cancer progression.', 'Kaempferol suppresses androgen-dependent and androgen-independent prostate cancer by regulating Ki67 expression.', 'Role of 20-Hydroxyeicosatetraenoic Acid (20-HETE) in Androgen-Mediated Cell Viability in Prostate Cancer Cells.', 'Anti-cancer Effect and Underlying Mechanism(s) of Kaempferol, a Phytoestrogen, on the Regulation of Apoptosis in Diverse Cancer Cell Models.', 'Application of Polyphenols and Flavonoids in Oncological Therapy.', 'Effects and Mechanisms of Kaempferol in the Management of Cancers through Modulation of Inflammation and Signal Transduction Pathways.', 'Why Do Dietary Flavonoids Have a Promising Effect as Enhancers of Anthracyclines?

CLCA1 also regulates Ca2+-dependent Cl- transport that involves the channel protein transmembrane protein 16A (TMEM16A) and its accessary molecules. CLCA1 modulates epithelial cell chloride current and participates in the pathogenesis of mucus hypersecretory-associated respiratory and gastrointestinal diseases, including asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cystic fibrosis, pneumonia, colon colitis, cystic fibrosis intestinal mucous disease, ulcerative colitis, and gastrointestinal parasitic infection. Most studies have been focused on the expression regulation of CLCA1 in human specimens. Limited studies used the CLCA1-deficient mice and CLCA1 blocking agents and yielded inconsistent conclusions regarding its role in these diseases. CLCA1 not only regulates mucin expression, but also participates in innate immune responses by binding to yet unidentified molecules on inflammatory cells for cytokine and chemokine production. CLCA1 also targets lymphatic endothelial cells and cancer cells by regulating lymphatic cell proliferation and lymphatic sinus growth in the lymphatic organs and controlling cancer cell differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis, all which depend on the location of the lymphatic vessels, the type of cancers, the presence of Th2 cytokines, and possibly the availability and type of CLCA1-binding proteins.

Also emerging is the role of gut bacteria in the conversion of C21 glucocorticoids to 11-oxygenated C19 androgens. Clostridium scindens ATCC 35,704 is a gut microbe capable of converting cortisol into 11-oxy-androgens by cleaving the side-chain. The desA and desB genes encode steroid-17,20-desmolase. Our prior study indicated that the urinary tract bacterium, Propionimicrobium lymphophilum ACS-093-V-SCH5 encodes desAB and converts cortisol to 11β-hydroxyandrostenedione. We wanted to determine how widespread this function occurs in the human microbiome. Phylogenetic and sequence similarity network analyses indicated that the steroid-17,20-desmolase pathway is taxonomically rare and located in gut and urogenital microbiomes. Two microbes from each of these niches, C. scindens and Propionimicrobium lymphophilum, respectively, were screened for activity against endogenous (cortisol, cortisone, and allotetrahydrocortisol) and exogenous (prednisone, prednisolone, dexamethasone, and 9-fluorocortisol) glucocorticoids. LC/MS analysis showed that both microbes were able to side-chain cleave all glucocorticoids, forming 11-oxy-androgens. Pure recombinant DesAB from C. scindens showed the highest activity against prednisone, a commonly prescribed glucocorticoid. In addition, 0.1 nM 1,4-androstadiene-3,11,17-trione, bacterial side-chain cleavage product of prednisone, showed significant proliferation relative to vehicle in androgen-dependent growth LNCaP prostate cancer cells after 24 h (2.3 fold; P < 0.01) and 72 h (1.6 fold; P < 0.01).

Because the biological mechanisms underlying this paradoxical association are poorly understood, we aimed to identify transcriptomic differences in primary tumour and peritumoral adipose tissue between obese patients and those at a normal weight.  Methods:   In this cohort study, we assessed data from five independent clinical cohorts of patients with clear cell RCC aged 18 years and older. Overweight patients were excluded from each cohort for our analysis. We assessed patients from the COMPARZ phase 3 clinical trial, a cohort from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), and a Memorial Sloan Kettering (MSK) observational immunotherapy cohort for their inclusion into our study. We assessed overall survival in obese patients (those with a body-mass index [BMI] ≥30 kg/m2) and in patients with a normal weight (BMI 18·5-24·9 kg/m2, as per WHO's BMI categories), defined as the time from treatment initiation (in the COMPARZ and MSK immunotherapy cohorts) or surgery (in the TCGA cohort) to the date of any-cause death or of censoring on the day of the last follow-up. We also evaluated and validated transcriptomic differences in the primary tumours of obese patients compared with those of a normal weight. We compared gene-expression differences in peritumoral adipose tissue and tumour tissue in an additional, prospectively collected cohort of patients with non-metastatic clear cell RCC (the MSK peritumoral adipose tissue cohort). We analysed differences in gene expression between obese patients and those at a normal weight in the COMPARZ, TCGA, and peritumoral adipose tissue cohorts. We also assessed the tumour immune microenvironment in a prospective cohort of patients who had nephrectomy for localised RCC at MSK.  Findings:   Of the 453 patients in the COMPARZ trial, 375 (83%) patients had available microarray data, pretreatment BMI measurements, and overall survival data for analyses, and we excluded 119 (26%) overweight patients, leaving a final cohort of 256 (68%) patients from this study for our analyses. From 332 patients in the TCGA cohort, we evaluated clinical and demographic data from 152 (46%) patients with advanced (ie, stages III and IV) clear cell RCC treated by nephrectomy; after exclusion of 59 (39%) overweight patients, our final cohort consisted of 93 (61%) patients. After exclusion of 74 (36%) overweight patients from the initial MSK immunotherapy study population of 203 participants, our final cohort for overall survival analysis comprised 129 (64%) participants. We found that overall survival was longer in obese patients than in those with normal weight in the TCGA cohort, after adjustment for stage or grade (adjusted HR 0·41, 95% CI 0·22-0·75), and in the COMPARZ clinical trial after adjustment for International Metastatic RCC Database (IMDC) risk score (0·68, 0·48-0·96). In the MSK immunotherapy cohort, the inverse association of BMI with mortality (HR 0·54, 95% CI 0·31-0·95) was not significant after adjustment for IMDC risk score (adjusted HR 0·72, 95% CI 0·40-1·30). Tumours of obese patients showed higher angiogenic scores on gene-set enrichment analysis-derived hallmark gene set angiogenesis signatures than did those of patients at a normal weight, but the degree of immune cell infiltration did not differ by BMI. We found increased peritumoral adipose tissue inflammation in obese patients relative to those at a normal weight, especially in peritumoral fat near the tumour.  Interpretation:   We found aspects of the tumour microenvironment that vary by BMI in the tumour and peritumoral adipose tissue, which might contribute to the apparent survival advantage in obese patients with clear cell RCC compared with patients at a normal weight. The complex interplay between the clear cell RCC tumour and peritumoral adipose tissue microenvironment might have clinical relevance and warrants further investigation.

In this study, we evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of the mpMRI with and without gadolinium, with emphasis on the added diagnostic value of the dynamic contrast enhancement (DCE).  Materials and methods:   The study was retrospective for 286 prostate lesions / 213 eligible patients, n = 116/170, and 49/59% malignant for the peripheral (Pz) and transitional zone (Tz), respectively. A stereotactic MRI-guided prostate biopsy served as the histological ground truth. All patients received a mpMRI with DCE. The influence of DCE in the prediction of malignancy was analyzed by blinded assessment of the imaging protocol without DCE and the DCE separately.  Results:   Significant (CSPca) and insignificant (IPca) prostate cancers were evaluated separately to enhance the potential effects of the DCE in the detection of CSPca. The Receiver Operating Characteristics Area Under Curve (ROC-AUC), sensitivity (Se) and specificity (Spe) of PIRADS-without-DCE in the Pz was 0.70/0.47/0.86 for all cancers (IPca and CSPca merged) and 0.73/0.54/0.82 for CSPca.

The aim of the present study is to evaluate the feasibility and possible side effects of transrectal, MRI-targeted intraprostatic steam application in dogs as an established large animal translational model for prostatic diseases in humans. Twelve healthy experimental, intact, male beagle dogs without evidence of prostatic pathology were recruited. An initial MRI examination was performed, and MRI-targeted steam was applied intraprostatically immediately thereafter. Serum levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), clinical and ultrasonographic examinations were performed periodically following the procedure to assess treatment effect. Four weeks after treatment, all dogs underwent follow-up MRI examinations and three needle-core biopsies were obtained from each prostatic lobe. Descriptive statistics were performed. MRI-guided intraprostatic steam application was successfully performed in the study population. The first day after steam application, 7/12 dogs had minimal signs of discomfort (grade 1/24 evaluated with the short-form Glasgow Composite Measure Pain Scale) and no dogs showed any sign of discomfort by day 6. CRP elevations were detected in 9/12 dogs during the first week post steam application.

Patients and methods:   We established a multi-national, longitudinal, observational registry of patients with prostate cancer presenting to participating tertiary care hospitals in eight Asian countries. A total of 3636 eligible patients with existing or newly diagnosed high-risk localised prostate cancer (HRL), non-metastatic biochemically recurrent prostate cancer (M0), or metastatic prostate cancer (M1), were consecutively enrolled and are being followed-up for 5 years. Patient history, demographic and disease characteristics, treatment and treatment decisions, were collected at first prostate cancer diagnosis and at enrolment. Patient-reported quality of life was prospectively assessed using the European Quality of Life-five Dimensions, five Levels (EQ-5D-5L) and Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy for Prostate Cancer questionnaires. In the present study, we report the first interim analysis of 2063 patients enrolled from study start (15 September 2015) until 18 May 2017.  Results:   Of the 2063 enrolled patients, 357 (17%), 378 (19%), and 1328 (64%) had HRL, M0 or M1 prostate cancer, respectively. The mean age at first diagnosis was similar in each group, 56% of all patients had extracapsular extension of their tumour, 28% had regional lymph node metastasis, and 53% had distant metastases. At enrolment, 62% of patients had at least one co-morbidity (mainly cardiovascular disease or diabetes), 91.8% of M1 patients had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance score of <2 and the mean EQ-5D-5L visual analogue score was 74.6-79.6 across cohorts. Treatment of M1 patients was primarily with combined androgen blockade (58%) or androgen-deprivation therapy (either orchidectomy or luteinising hormone-releasing hormone analogues) (32%). Decisions to start therapy were mainly driven by treatment guidelines and disease progression. Decision to discontinue therapy was most often due to disease progression (hormonal drug therapy) or completion of therapy (chemotherapy).  Conclusion:   In the UFO registry of advanced prostate cancer in Asia, regional differences exist in prostate cancer treatment patterns that will be explored more deeply during the follow-up period; prospective follow-up is ongoing.

The point mutation ARF876L was reported to be stimulated, instead of inhibited, by enzalutamide, thus contributing to enzalutamide resistance. We have recently developed JJ-450 as a novel AR antagonist with the potential to treat enzalutamide-resistant castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC).  Methods:   We employed several assays to determine the impact of JJ-450 and enzalutamide on prostate cancer cell lines expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP)-ARF876L . These assays include a prostate-specific antigen enhancer/promoter-based luciferase assay to determine AR transcriptional activity, a quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction assay, and Western blot analysis to detect expression of AR-target genes at the messenger RNA and protein level, fluorescence microscopy to show AR subcellular localization, and a 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine assay to measure prostate cancer cell proliferation.  Results:   As expected, enzalutamide inhibited wild-type (WT) AR but not ARF876L transcriptional activity in the luciferase assay. In contrast, JJ-450 inhibited both WT-AR and ARF876L transcriptional activity to a similar extent. Also, enzalutamide retarded androgen-induced nuclear import of GFP-AR, but not GFP-ARF876L , whereas JJ-450 retarded nuclear import of both GFP-AR and GFP-ARF876L . To further evaluate JJ-450 inhibition of ARF876L , we stably transfected C4-2 cells separately with GFP-AR or GFP-ARF876L . Enzalutamide inhibited endogenous AR-target gene expression in C4-2-GFP-ARWT , but not in the C4-2-GFP-ARF876L subline, whereas JJ-450 inhibited AR-target gene expression in both C4-2 sublines. More importantly, enzalutamide inhibited proliferation of C4-2-GFP-ARWT , but not of the C4-2-GFP-ARF876L subline, whereas JJ-450 inhibited proliferation of both C4-2 sublines.  Conclusion:   JJ-450 inhibits enzalutamide-resistant ARF876L mutant nuclear translocation and function.

However, there is no data for men of African ancestry. The objective of this study was to estimate the overall, specific, and metastasis-free survival (MFS) of patients with a Gleason 6 score, based on the surgical specimen.  Patients and methods:   This was a monocentric retrospective study that included 723 consecutive patients treated by radical prostatectomy between 1 January 1 2000 and 31 March 2018, with a Gleason score of 6 based on the surgical specimen. Specific survival (SS) was defined as the time elapsed between surgery and death attributed to prostate cancer. Overall survival was defined as the time elapsed between surgery and death from all causes. The causes of death were verified in the medical records. Survival analyses without biochemical recurrence (BCR) and without salvage treatment were performed according to the Kaplan-Meier method. The Cox model was used for univariate and multivariate analyses.  Results:   In total, 691 patients were included because 32 were excluded for missing data. Overall 5- and 10-year survival was 94.2% and 87.1%, respectively. SS and MFS were 100%, with a median follow-up of 8.5 years. The BCR rate was 16.5%, with a median time to BCR of 5.1 years. The frequency of salvage treatment was 13.0%, with a median time to surgery of 7.3 years. In univariate analysis, PSA, pathological stage, seminal vesicle invasion, positive margins, and lymph node dissection were significantly associated with an increased risk of BCR and salvage treatment, but only PSA and positive margins were significantly associated by multivariate analysis.

Many algorithms have been designed to optimize beam orientation selection because of its impact on treatment plan quality, but these algorithms suffer from slow calculation of the dose influence matrices of all candidate beams. We propose a fast beam orientation selection method, based on deep learning neural networks (DNN), capable of developing a plan comparable to those developed by the state-of-the-art column generation (CG) method. Our model's novelty lies in its supervised learning structure (using CG to teach the network), DNN architecture, and ability to learn from anatomical features to predict dosimetrically suitable beam orientations without using dosimetric information from the candidate beams. This may save hours of computation.  Methods:   A supervised DNN is trained to mimic the CG algorithm, which iteratively chooses beam orientations one-by-one by calculating beam fitness values based on Karush-Kush-Tucker optimality conditions at each iteration. The DNN learns to predict these values. The dataset contains 70 prostate cancer patients - 50 training, 7 validation, and 13 test patients - to develop and test the model. Each patient's data contains 6 contours: PTV, body, bladder, rectum, and left and right femoral heads. Column generation was implemented with a GPU-based Chambolle-Pock algorithm, a first-order primal-dual proximal-class algorithm, to create 6270 plans. The DNN trained over 400 epochs, each with 2500 steps and a batch size of 1, using the Adam optimizer at a learning rate of 1 × 10-5 and a sixfold cross-validation technique.  Results:   The average and standard deviation of training, validation, and testing loss functions among the six folds were 0.62 ± 0.09%, 1.04 ± 0.06%, and 1.44 ± 0.11%, respectively. Using CG and supervised DNN, we generated two sets of plans for each scenario in the test set. The proposed method took at most 1.5 s to select a set of five beam orientations and 300 s to calculate the dose influence matrices for 5 beams and finally 20 s to solve the fluence map optimization (FMO). However, CG needed around 15 h to calculate the dose influence matrices of all beams and at least 400 s to solve both the beam orientation selection and FMO problems. The differences in the dose coverage of PTV between plans generated by CG and by DNN were 0.2%. The average dose differences received by organs at risk were between 1 and 6 percent: Bladder had the smallest average difference in dose received (0.956 ± 1.184%), then Rectum (2.44 ± 2.11%), Left Femoral Head (6.03 ± 5.86%), and Right Femoral Head (5.885 ± 5.515%). The dose received by Body had an average difference of 0.10 ± 0.1% between the generated treatment plans.  Conclusions:   We developed a fast beam orientation selection method based on a DNN that selects beam orientations in seconds and is therefore suitable for clinical routines. In the training phase of the proposed method, the model learns the suitable beam orientations based on patients' anatomical features and omits time intensive calculations of dose influence matrices for all possible candidate beams. Solving the FMO to get the final treatment plan requires calculating dose influence matrices only for the selected beams.""","""['Azar Sadeghnejad Barkousaraie', 'Olalekan Ogunmolu', 'Steve Jiang', 'Dan Nguyen']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Using deep learning to predict beam-tunable Pareto optimal dose distribution for intensity-modulated radiation therapy.', 'Penalized likelihood fluence optimization with evolutionary components for intensity modulated radiation therapy treatment planning.', 'Integrated beam orientation and scanning-spot optimization in intensity-modulated proton therapy for brain and unilateral head and neck tumors.', 'A zeroing neural dynamics based acceleration optimization approach for optimizers in deep neural networks.', 'Knowledge-based radiation treatment planning: A data-driven method survey.', 'Machine Learning for Predicting Clinician Evaluation of Treatment Plans for Left-Sided Whole Breast Radiation Therapy.', 'Beam angle optimization for proton therapy via group-sparsity based angle generation method.', 'Using Artificial Intelligence for Optimization of the Processes and Resource Utilization in Radiotherapy.', 'Advances in Automated Treatment Planning.', 'A reinforcement learning application of a guided Monte Carlo Tree Search algorithm for beam orientation selection in radiation therapy.']"""

DJ-1 could alter autophagy and regulate Beclin1-involved autophagy response through JNK-dependent pathway. JNK is known to mediate autophagy through Bcl2-Beclin1 complex. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the significance of autophagy in DJ-1-modulated PCa cells. The current studies showed that DJ-1 overexpression in LNCaP decreased LC3 transformation and autophagosome formation. However, DJ-1 knockdown exerted the opposite effect. Moreover, DJ-1 silencing inhibited survival and promoted death in LNCaP, which was recovered by autophagy inhibition with 3-MA. In addition, DJ-1 overexpression inhibited the phosphorylation of JNK and Bcl2, and the dissociation of Beclin1 and Bcl2; while the effect of silencing DJ-1 was completely opposite. More important, JNK activated by anisimycin inhibited the proliferation and promoted death of DJ-1-overexpressed LNCaP while increasing LC3 transformation and LC3-puncta formation, but these results were reversed by the decrease of Beclin1 (by spautin-1). In contrast, when DJ-1 was silenced, the death of LNCaP, LC3 transformation, and LC3-puncta formation were inhibited by JNK inhibitor SP600125, which promoted cell proliferation. However, Bcl2 inhibition (by ABT737) reversed all the effects of SP600125.

To analyze data from two-phase designs with a binary outcome, parametric models such as logistic regression are often adopted. However, when the model assumptions are not valid, parametric models may lead to biased estimation and risk evaluation. In this paper, we propose a robust semiparametric regression model for binary outcomes and an easy-to-implement computational procedure that combines the pool-adjacent violators algorithm with inverse probability weighting. The asymptotic properties are established, including consistency and the convergence rate. Simulation studies show that the proposed method performs well and is more robust than logistic regression methods.

We examined influence of the respiratory phase in the IGRT on dose variation by interplay effect. Intra-fractional prostate motions of patients who were implanted fiducial marker were measured using fluoroscopy, then we reconstructed plans considering for the respiratory phase in IGRT and the respiratory motion during volumetric modulated arc therapy. Averages of the intra-fractional prostate motion in left-right, anterior-posterior and superior-inferior direction were 0.039, 0.49 and 1.6 mm respectively. There was a patient whose intra-fractional prostate motion was larger than 4 mm that was planning target volume margin. By changing the respiratory phase like inspiration, exhalation and dispersing respiratory phase in each fraction, dose variation from original plan became smaller in order of the inspiration, exhalation and dispersion. The largest variations of dose indices in clinical target volume, bladder and rectum were 8.0%, 4.5% and 9.1% respectively when IGRT was done in inspiration. When the IGRT is performed by the same respiratory phase in each fraction, systematic dose variations may occur even if the respiratory phase at the timing of irradiation is changed. By dispersing the respiratory phase in each fraction, the variations in all dose indices were<1% from original plan. We realized that dispersing the respiratory phase in IGRT by each fraction is effective to reduce the dose variation caused by the respiratory phase in IGRT.""","""['Fumiyasu Matsubayashi', 'Ryo Takahashi', 'Tatsuya Kamima', 'Yosuke Sato', 'Tomoharu Sato']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Nihon Hoshasen Gijutsu Gakkai Zasshi""","""['Dosimetric evaluation of image-guided radiation therapy for prostate cancer.', 'Assessment and management of interfractional variations in daily diagnostic-quality-CT guided prostate-bed irradiation after prostatectomy.', 'Daily dosimetric variation between image-guided volumetric modulated arc radiotherapy and MR-guided daily adaptive radiotherapy for prostate cancer stereotactic body radiotherapy.', 'Image-Guided Radiotherapy for Pelvic Cancers: A Review of Current Evidence and Clinical Utilisation.', 'Benefit of intensity modulated and image-guided radiotherapy in prostate cancer.']"""

Objective:   To determine whether radiotherapy ± hormone therapy is superior to hormone therapy alone in such patients.  Design, setting, and participants:   This study is a multicentre, randomised, open-label, phase 3 trial. Patients with localised prostate cancer whose PSA concentrations had decreased to <0.1 ng/ml after RP, and then increased to 0.4-1.0 ng/ml, were randomised to the salvage hormone therapy (SHT) group (80 mg bicalutamide [BCL] followed by luteinising hormone-releasing hormone agonist in case of BCL failure) or the salvage radiation therapy (SRT) ± SHT group (64.8 Gy of SRT followed by the same regimen as in the SHT group in case of SRT failure). From May 2004 to May 2011, 210 patients (105 in each arm) were registered, with the median follow-up being 5.5 yr.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   The primary endpoint was time to treatment failure (TTF) of BCL.  Results and limitations:   TTF of BCL was significantly longer in the SRT ± SHT group (8.6 yr) than in the SHT group (5.6 yr; hazard ratio 0.56, 90% confidence interval [0.40-0.77]; one-sided p = 0.001). Thirty-two of 102 patients (31%) in the SRT ± SHT group did not have SRT treatment failure. However, clinical relapse-free survival and overall survival did not differ between the arms. The most frequent grade 3-4 adverse event was erectile dysfunction (83 patients [80%] in the SHT group vs. 76 [74%] in the SRT ± SHT group). Limitations include the short follow-up periods and surrogate endpoint setting to allow definitive conclusions.  Conclusions:   Initial SRT prolongs TTF of BCL in patients with post-RP PSA failure, indicating that SRT ± SHT is more beneficial than SHT alone.

We hypothesized HRT would have a protective benefit with reduced NSCLC incidence among women in a large, prospective cohort.  Methods:   We used data from the multicenter randomized Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial (1993-2001). Participants were women aged 50 to 74 years followed prospectively for up to 13 years for cancer screening. The influence of HRT on the primary outcome of NSCLC incidence and secondary outcomes of all-cause and disease-specific mortality were assessed with Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox proportional hazard models adjusting for covariates.  Results:   In the overall cohort of 75,587 women, 1147 women developed NSCLC after a median follow-up of 11.5 years. HRT use was characterized as 49.4% current users, 17.0% former users, and 33.6% never users. Increased age, smoking, comorbidities, and family history were associated with increased risk of NSCLC. On multivariable analysis, current HRT use was associated with reduced risk of NSCLC compared with never users (hazard ratio, 0.80; 95% confidence interval, 0.70-0.93; P = .009). HRT or oral contraception use was not associated with significant differences in all-cause mortality or disease-specific mortality.

Recently, a saddle point approximation (SPA) based single-variant test has been developed to provide an accurate and scalable method to test for associations of such phenotypes. For gene- or region-based multiple-variant tests, a few methods exist that can adjust for unbalanced case-control ratios; however, these methods are either less accurate when case-control ratios are extremely unbalanced or not scalable for large data analyses. To address these problems, we propose SKAT- and SKAT-O- type region-based tests; in these tests, the single-variant score statistic is calibrated based on SPA and efficient resampling (ER). Through simulation studies, we show that the proposed method provides well-calibrated p values. In contrast, when the case-control ratio is 1:99, the unadjusted approach has greatly inflated type I error rates (90 times that of exome-wide sequencing α = 2.5 × 10-6). Additionally, the proposed method has similar computation time to the unadjusted approaches and is scalable for large sample data. In our application, the UK Biobank whole-exome sequence data analysis of 45,596 unrelated European samples and 791 PheCode phenotypes identified 10 rare-variant associations with p value < 10-7, including the associations between JAK2 and myeloproliferative disease, HOXB13 and cancer of prostate, and F11 and congenital coagulation defects.

Pathology diagnosis is usually done by a pathologist observing tissue-stained glass slide under a microscope.  Method:   Multispectral photoacoustic (MPA) specimen imaging has proven successful in differentiating photoacoustic (PA) signal characteristics between a histopathology-defined cancer region and normal tissue. This is mainly due to its ability to efficiently map oxyhemoglobin and deoxyhemoglobin contents from MPA images and key features for cancer detection. A fully automated deep learning algorithm is purposed, which learns to detect the presence of malignant tissue in freshly excised ex vivo human thyroid and prostate tissue specimens using the three-dimensional MPA dataset. The proposed automated deep learning model consisted of the convolutional neural network architecture, which extracts spatially colocated features, and a softmax function, which detects thyroid and prostate cancer tissue at once. This is one of the first deep learning models, to the best of our knowledge, to detect the presence of cancer in excised thyroid and prostate tissue of humans at once based on PA imaging.  Result:   The area under the curve (AUC) was used as a metric to evaluate the predictive performance of the classifier. The proposed model detected the cancer tissue with the AUC of 0.96, which is very promising.  Conclusion:   This model is an improvement over the previous work using machine learning and deep learning algorithms. This model may have immediate application in cancer screening of the numerous sliced specimens that result from thyroidectomy and prostatectomy. Since the instrument that was used to capture the ex vivo PA images is now being developed for in vivo use, this model may also prove to be a starting point for in vivo PA image analysis for cancer diagnosis.""","""['Kamal Jnawali', 'Bhargava Chinni', 'Vikram Dogra', 'Navalgund Rao']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Int J Comput Assist Radiol Surg""","""['Preliminary results of ex vivo multispectral photoacoustic imaging in the management of thyroid cancer.', 'Semi-automatic classification of prostate cancer on multi-parametric MR imaging using a multi-channel 3D convolutional neural network.', 'A Transfer Learning Approach for Malignant Prostate Lesion Detection on Multiparametric MRI.', 'Sounding out the hidden data: A concise review of deep learning in photoacoustic imaging.', 'Deep learning in photoacoustic imaging: a review.', 'Photoacoustic and absorption spectroscopy imaging analysis of human blood.', 'Automated Recognition of Cancer Tissues through Deep Learning Framework from the Photoacoustic Specimen.', 'Photoacoustic imaging aided with deep learning: a review.', 'Two-Dimensional Photoacoustic/Ultrasonic Endoscopic Imaging Based on a Line-Focused Transducer.', 'In Vitro and In Vivo Multispectral Photoacoustic Imaging for the Evaluation of Chromophore Concentration.']"""

Additional late imaging has been shown to be a powerful method for the discrimination between PC and non-PC lesions, owing to the increasing tracer uptake of the former. Nevertheless, there are no pre-existing studies which describe the dynamic tracer uptake for ganglia, which this present study aims to address.  Methods:   Fifty consecutive patients with PC who received standard and late 68Ga-PSMA-11-PET/CT (by local protocol at 1.5 h ""standard"" and 2.5 h p.i. ""late"") underwent retrospective evaluation. All lesions with a tracer uptake above local background indicative for ganglia as well as PC lesions were analysed with regard to their maximum standardised uptake values (SUVmax) and localisation.  Results:   Overall, 86 PSMA-positive ganglia were identified in 70% (n = 35) of the patients. Five ganglia exhibited PSMA avidity at late imaging only, and three at standard imaging only. A total of 66 lesions suggestive for PC were detected in 44 patients (88%), of which 45% (n = 30) were morphologically identified as lymph nodes (LN), the remainder being locally recurrent lesions or bone metastases. No solid organ metastases were present in our cohort. At late scanning, 73% of the LN exhibited an increase in SUVmax, whereas 65% of the ganglia exhibited a decreasing or stable SUVmax.  Conclusion:   Whereas the presence of increasing tracer uptake in potential PC lesions can provide additional data about the likelihood of malignancy, increasing SUVmax alone does not reliably differentiate between ganglia and PC lesions and is a potential diagnostic pitfall.

The aim of this study was to determine the impact of a changing population structure on identification of familial prostate cancer (PCa), and to investigate how many and which types of other cancers have occurred in patients and their first-degree relatives.  Materials and methods:   A total of 19,540 patients were evaluated in a prospectively collected PCa family database and divided into four birth cohorts: 1925-1934 (cohort A), 1935-1944 (cohort B), 1945-1954 (cohort C), and 1955-1964 (cohort D). Other primary cancers and cancers of first-degree relatives were evaluated.  Results:   The percentage of PCa patients with ≥2 sons declined (A: 28.9% to D: 21.6%). The percentage of patients whose fathers lived for ≥65 years increased (B: 64.2% to D: 73.0%). Malignancies of the skin, the urinary tract, and the lymphoid/hematopoietic tissue were more common in patients with a positive first-degree PCa family history and their first-degree relatives. Additionally, first-degree relatives reported more often neoplasms of respiratory/intrathoracic organs and the female breast.  Conclusions:   A small family size, an early deceased father, and a high number of sporadic cases complicate the identification of familial PCa patients. Thus, a detailed family history should also include unaffected first-degree relatives to avoid any misclassification. Findings of other primary cancers in patients and their relatives warrant further investigation.""","""['Valentin Henri Meissner', 'Robert Bittner', 'Martina Kron', 'Stefan Schiele', 'Helga Schulwitz', 'Jürgen Erich Gschwend', 'Kathleen Herkommer']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Urol Int""","""['Multiple primary cancers in men with sporadic or familial prostate cancer: Its clinical implications.', 'A Germline Variant at 8q24 Contributes to Familial Clustering of Prostate Cancer in Men of African Ancestry.', 'Familial prostate cancer research: meaningfulness of hereditary criteria in view of demographic change.', 'A systematic review and meta-analysis of familial prostate cancer risk.', 'Site-specific familial aggregation of prostate cancer.', 'Familial prostate cancer and genetic predisposition.']"""

Salivary duct carcinoma (SDC) is typically positive for androgen receptor (AR). Therefore, we hypothesized that NKX3.1 is a new immunohistochemical marker for SDC and aimed to investigate whether NKX3.1 staining in combination with other immunomarkers of prostate carcinoma could have a diagnostic or prognostic value in SDC.  Methods:   Materials obtained from 42 resected SDCs were examined by immunohistochemistry using antibodies against AR, NKX3.1, α-methylacyl-CoA racemase (AMACR), prostatic acid phosphatase (PAP), and prostate-specific antigen (PSA).  Results:   In immunoreactivity among SDC cases, 81.0, 35.7, 58.5, 33.3, and 0% were positive for AR, NKX3.1, AMACR, PAP, and PSA, respectively. AMACR and PAP immunoreactivity rates were higher in recurrence cases than in cases with no recurrence.  Conclusions:   NKX3.1 expression is useful for SDC diagnosis, but decreased NKX3.1 expression was not correlated with SDC progression. The immunoreactivity of AMACR and PAP could be useful for assessing prognosis in SDC, but immunohistochemical staining of prostate-specific markers should be interpreted with caution when determining whether a metastatic tumor is of prostate origin, especially when patients have a history of SDC.""","""['Nami Takada', 'Haruto Nishida', 'Yuzo Oyama', 'Takahiro Kusaba', 'Hiroko Kadowaki', 'Motoki Arakane', 'Junpei Wada', 'Shogo Urabe', 'Tsutomu Daa']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Pathobiology""","""['Expression of androgen receptor and prostatic specific markers in salivary duct carcinoma: an immunohistochemical analysis of 13 cases and review of the literature.', 'Expression pattern of androgen receptor and AR-V7 in androgen-deprivation therapy-naïve salivary duct carcinomas.', 'NKX3.1 as a marker of prostatic origin in metastatic tumors.', 'Salivary Duct Carcinoma: An Update on Morphologic Mimics and Diagnostic Use of Androgen Receptor Immunohistochemistry.', 'Immunohistochemistry in diagnostic surgical pathology of the prostate.', 'Histopathological Aspects of the Prognostic Factors for Salivary Gland Cancers.', 'NKX3.1 Expression and Molecular Characterization of Secretory Myoepithelial Carcinoma (SMCA): Advancing the Case for a Salivary Mucous Acinar Phenotype.', 'NKX3.1 Expression in Salivary Gland ""Intraductal"" Papillary Mucinous Neoplasm: A Low-Grade Subtype of Salivary Gland Mucinous Adenocarcinoma.', 'Nkx3-1 and Fech genes might be switch genes involved in pituitary non-functioning adenoma invasiveness.', 'The Role of Nkx3.1 in Cancers and Stemness.']"""

Patient and methods:   A 66-year-old male diagnosed with localized prostate cancer and a left kidney renal mass incidentally found on computed tomography (CT) scan during prostate cancer evaluation. Procedures were performed using a single supra-umbilical 3cm incision, plus one additional laparoscopic port, utilizing a standard Gelpoint® (Applied Medical, Rancho Santa Margarita, CA, EE.UU.) and replicating the technique previously described for single-port transperitoneal radical prostatectomy and partial nephrectomy with the use of the SP® robotic platform.  Results:   Total operative time was 256minutes (min) with a console time of 108min for radical prostatectomy, and 101min for the partial nephrectomy respectively, including a warm ischemia time of 26min. Estimated blood loss was 250cc. Blood transfusion was not needed. Final pathology for prostate was adenocarcinoma Gleason 7 (4+3) and for the kidney lesion was renal cell carcinoma. After two months of follow-up, PSA was undetectable and no complications or recurrence were detected.  Conclusions:   The single-port approach has advantages as easier surgical planning and transition for combined and multi-quadrants surgeries: faster recovery, minimal postoperative pain and need for opioids, and excellent cosmetic outcome.

Methods and materials:   This study retrospectively enrolled 235 patients with suspected PCa in our hospital from January 2016 to December 2017, and all lesions were histopathologically confirmed. The lesions were scored according to the Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System version 2 (PI-RADS V2). The bpMRI (T2-weighted imaging [T2WI], diffusion-weighted imaging [DWI]/apparent diffusion coefficient [ADC]) and mpMRI (T2WI, DWI/ADC and DCE) scores were recorded to plot the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. The area under the curve (AUC), accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value (NPV), and positive predictive value (PPV) for each method were calculated and compared. The patients were further stratified according to bpMRI scores (bpMRI ≥3, and bpMRI = 3, 4, 5) to analyse the difference in DCE MRI between PCa and non-PCa lesions (as well as between csPCa and non-csPCa).  Results:   The AUC values for the bpMRI and mpMRI protocols for PCa were comparable (0.790 [0.732-0.840] and 0.791 [0.733-0.841], respectively). The accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV of bpMRI for PCa were 76.2, 79.5, 72.6, 75.8, and 76.6%, respectively, and the values for mpMRI were 77.4, 84.4, 69.9, 75.2, and 80.6%, respectively. The AUC values for the bpMRI and mpMRI protocols for the diagnosis of csPCa were similar (0.781 [0.722-0.832] and 0.779 [0.721-0.831], respectively). The accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV of bpMRI for csPCa were 74.0, 83.8, 66.9, 64.8, and 85.0%, respectively; and 73.6, 87.9, 63.2, 63.2, and 87.8%, respectively, for mpMRI. For patients with bpMRI scores ≥3, positive DCE results were more common in PCa and csPCa lesions (both P = 0.001). Further stratification analysis showed that for patients with a bpMRI score = 4, PCa and csPCa lesions were more likely to have positive DCE results (P = 0.003 and P < 0.001, respectively).  Conclusion:   The diagnostic accuracy of bpMRI is comparable with that of mpMRI in the detection of PCa and the identification of csPCa. DCE MRI is helpful in further identifying PCa and csPCa lesions in patients with bpMRI ≥3, especially bpMRI = 4, which may be conducive to achieving a more accurate PCa risk stratification.

PVT1 gives rise to multiple transcripts which may have different functions. Here, we describe a real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR)-based assay for copy number-based quantitation of PVT1 exons 4A, 4B, and 9 to enable accurate, reproducible, and quantifiable detection.  Methods:   PVT1 exons 4A, 4B, and 9 were cloned into a plasmid vector to create standards for subsequent creation of linear standard curves representing a broad range of concentrations. PCR was carried out using SYBR-Green signal detection to quantify PVT1 exons 4A, 4B, and 9. The efficacy of this assay was evaluated by using it to detect these transcripts in prostate epithelial and prostate cancer cell lines, normal and cancerous human prostate tissues, human serum, mouse plasma, and urine samples.  Results:   The results indicate that the assay can be used to quantify both low and high copy numbers of PVT1-derived transcripts. This is the first report of a copy number-based quantification assay for non-invasive detection of PVT1 derived transcripts.

In patients with metastatic prostate cancer, there are no data as yet on interobserver and intraobserver variability when assessing PSMA-positive lesions for longitudinal changes of tracer uptake.  Methods:   Tc-MIP-1404 SPECT/CT scans of 22 patients with metastatic prostate cancer were analyzed, and each subject was imaged at 2 separate points in time, before and after treatment. Mean interval between scans was 10 months. Three independent observers visually assessed a total of 96 PSMA-positive metastases (bone, 69; lymph node, 22; viscera, 3) or local recurrences (n = 2) for longitudinal changes in tracer uptake on planar scintigraphy and SPECT/CT. All lesions were categorized as regressive, stable, or progressive based on visual findings and on peak SUV (SUVpeak) of quantitative SPECT/CT (progressive, >30% SUVpeak increase; regressive, <30% SUVpeak decrease; or stable, all others).  Results:   Quantitative analysis of PSMA-positive lesions yielded significantly higher interobserver agreement (90.6%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.83%-0.96%) than visual assessments by either SPECT/CT (76.0%; 95% CI, 0.66%-0.84%) or planar scintigraphy (56.3%; 95% CI, 0.46%-0.66%). Intermethod comparison of aggregated results yielded significantly higher agreement between quantitative and visual SPECT/CT (85.1%; 95% CI, 0.80%-0.89%), as opposed to quantitative SPECT/CT and planar scintigraphy (53.1%; 95% CI, 0.47%-0.59%) or visual SPECT/CT and planar scintigraphy (54.9%; 95% CI, 0.49%-0.61%). In visual and quantitative analysis of 96 PSMA-positive lesions, the number of discrepancies ranged from 9 (9.4%) for quantitative SPECT/CT to 42 (43.8%) for planar scintigraphy. Overall reader confidence was higher for SPECT/CT than for planar scintigraphy (P < 0.001). Intraobserver agreement was near-perfect for all methods, whether SPECT/CT (visual, all κ = 0.94-0.97; quantitative κ = 0.94-0.98) or planar scintigraphy (all κ = 0.90-0.94).  Conclusions:   Quantitative evaluation of longitudinal change in tracer uptake by PSMA-positive lesions measured via SPECT/CT is superior to visual interpretation of images by planar scintigraphy or SPECT/CT.

The etiology of PCa has been attributed to both environmental and genetic factors. In recent years, many studies have reported that miRNA gene single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) influence the susceptibility to several diseases such as cancer. To date, the mechanisms of PCa have remained unknown. The main aim of this study was to evaluate the association between PCa susceptibility and miRNA gene SNPs. A total of 156 PCa cases and 188 control subjects were included in this case-control study. The data were collected from hospitalized cases. We collected the demographic characteristic information, which included age, body mass index, tobacco smoking, alcohol consumption, and family history of cancer. Polymorphisms were analyzed by the ligase detection reaction. Unconditional logistic and stratified analyses were used to analyze the association between these SNPs and PCa susceptibility and to calculate the adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and the 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Cox regression model and the log-rank test were used to test the association between genetic variants and the overall survival. We found that miR-23a gene polymorphism rs3745453 carrying CC homozygotes had a 4.16-fold increased risk (95% CI = 1.30-13.25) than those carrying the TT/CT genotypes (P = .02), and the C allele displayed a higher prevalence of PCa than the T allele (OR = 1.68, 95% CI = 1.16-2.45, P = .01). Moreover, miR-23a showed that the homozygous carriers of the C-variant significantly increased the risk of survival rate as compared to the carriers of the TT/CT genotype (OR = 9.67, 95% CI = 2.83-33.09, P = .001).

Whether documented admixed with PCa or in its rare pure form, numerous studies associate this entity with clinical aggressiveness. Despite increasing clinical experience and requirement of IDC-P documentation in protocols for synoptic reporting, the specifics of its potential contribution to assessment of grade group (GG) and cancer quantitation of PCa in both needle biopsies (NBx) and radical prostatectomy (RP) specimens remain unclear. Moreover, there are no standard guidelines for incorporating basal cell marker immunohistochemistry (IHC) in the diagnosis of IDC-P, either alone or as part of a cocktail with AMACR/racemase. An online survey containing 26 questions regarding diagnosis, reporting practices, and IHC resource utilization, focusing on IDC-P, was undertaken by 42 genitourinary subspecialists from 9 countries. The degree of agreement or disagreement regarding approaches to individual questions was classified as significant majority (>75%), majority (51% to 75%), minority (26% to 50%) and significant minority (≤25%). IDC-P with or without invasive cancer is considered a contraindication for active surveillance by the significant majority (95%) of respondents, although a majority (66%) also agreed that the clinical significance/behavior of IDC-P on NBx or RP with PCa required further study. The majority do not upgrade PCa based on comedonecrosis seen only in the intraductal component in NBx (62%) or RP (69%) specimens. Similarly, recognizable IDC-P with GG1 PCa was not a factor in upgrading in NBx (78%) or RP (71%) specimens. The majority (60%) of respondents include readily recognizable IDC-P in assessment of linear extent of PCa at NBx. A significant majority (78%) would use IHC to confirm or exclude intraductal carcinoma if other biopsies showed no PCa, while 60% would use it to confirm IDC-P with invasive PCa in NBx if it would change the overall GG assignment. Nearly half (48%, a minority) would use IHC to confirm IDC-P for accurate Gleason pattern 4 quantitation. A majority (57%) report the percentage of IDC-P when present, in RP specimens. When obvious Gleason pattern 4 or 5 PCa is present in RP or NBx, IHC is rarely to almost never used to confirm the presence of IDC-P by the significant majority (88% and 90%, respectively). Most genitourinary pathologists consider IDC-P to be an adverse prognostic feature independent of the PCa grade, although recommendations for standardization are needed to guide reporting of IDC-P vis a vis tumor quantitation and final GG assessment. The use of IHC varies widely and is performed for a multitude of indications, although it is used most frequently in scenarios where confirmation of IDC-P would impact the GG assigned. Further study and best practices recommendations are needed to provide guidance with regards to the most appropriate indications for IHC use in scenarios regarding IDC-P.""","""['Jatin S Gandhi', 'Steven C Smith', 'Gladell P Paner', 'Jesse K McKenney', 'Radhika Sekhri', 'Adeboye O Osunkoya', 'Alexander S Baras', 'Angelo M DeMarzo', 'John C Cheville', 'Rafael E Jimenez', 'Kiril Trpkov', 'Maurizio Colecchia', 'Jae Y Ro', 'Rodolfo Montironi', 'Santosh Menon', 'Ondrej Hes', 'Sean R Williamson', 'Michelle S Hirsch', 'George J Netto', 'Samson W Fine', 'Deepika Sirohi', 'Seema Kaushal', 'Ankur Sangoi', 'Brian D Robinson', 'Charlotte F Kweldam', 'Peter A Humphrey', 'Donna E Hansel', 'Luciana Schultz', 'Cristina Magi-Galluzzi', 'Christopher G Przybycin', 'Rajal B Shah', 'Rohit Mehra', 'Lakshmi P Kunju', 'Manju Aron', 'Oleksandr N Kryvenko', 'James G Kench', 'Naoto Kuroda', 'Fabio Tavora', 'Theodorus van der Kwast', 'David J Grignon', 'Jonathan I Epstein', 'Victor E Reuter', 'Mahul B Amin']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Am J Surg Pathol""","""['Improved Prostate Cancer Biopsy Grading by Incorporation of Invasive Cribriform and Intraductal Carcinoma in the 2014 Grade Groups.', 'Atypical intraductal proliferation detected in prostate needle biopsy is a marker of unsampled intraductal carcinoma and other adverse pathological features: a prospective clinicopathological study of 62 cases with emphasis on pathological outcomes.', 'Prostate Biopsy Specimens With Gleason 3+3=6 and Intraductal Carcinoma: Radical Prostatectomy Findings and Clinical Outcomes.', 'The 2019 Genitourinary Pathology Society (GUPS) White Paper on Contemporary Grading of Prostate Cancer.', 'Features and Prognostic Significance of Intraductal Carcinoma of the Prostate.', 'Longitudinal Changes and Predictive Value of Multiparametric MRI Features for Prostate Cancer Patients Treated with MRI-Guided Lattice Extreme Ablative Dose (LEAD) Boost Radiotherapy.', 'Cribriform Patterned Lesions in the Prostate Gland with Emphasis on Differential Diagnosis and Clinical Significance.', 'WHO Classification of Tumours fifth edition: evolving issues in the classification, diagnosis, and prognostication of prostate cancer.', 'Contemporary Grading of Prostate Cancer: The Impact of Grading Criteria and the Significance of the Amount of Intraductal Carcinoma.', 'Dimensional reduction based on peak fitting of Raman micro spectroscopy data improves detection of prostate cancer in tissue specimens.']"""

In our study, the expression of CAMK2N1 was assessed by qRT-PCR in PCa patient tissues and cell lines including PC-3 and PC-3-DR. Cells transfected with miR-129-5p mimics, inhibitor, CAMK2N1 or negative controls (NC) were used to interrogate their effects on DR cell invasions, migrations and apoptosis during docetaxel (DTX) treatments. The apoptosis rate of the PCa cells was validated by flow cytometry. Relationships between miR-129-5p and CAMK2N1 levels were identified by qRT-PCR and dual-luciferase reporter assay. CAMK2N1 was found to be down-expressed in DR PCa tissue sample, and low levels of CAMK2N1 were correlated with high docetaxel resistance and clinical prediction of poor survival. CAMK2N1 levels were decreased in DR PCa cells treated with DXT. We further explored that up-regulation of miR-129-5p could promote DR PCa cells viability, invasion and migration but demote apoptosis. Involved molecular mechanism studies revealed that miR-129-5p reduced downstream CAMK2N1 expression to further impact on chemoresistance to docetaxel of PCa cells, indicating its vital role in PCa docetaxel resistance. Our findings revealed that miR-129-5p contributed to the resistance of PC-3-DR cells to docetaxel through suppressing CAMK2N1 expression, and thus targeting miR-129-5p may provide a novel therapeutic approach in sensitizing PCa to future docetaxel treatment.""","""['Cheng Wu', 'Chunqing Miao', 'Qingsheng Tang', 'Xunrong Zhou', 'Pengshan Xi', ""Ping'an Chang"", 'Lixin Hua', 'Haodong Ni']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""J Cell Mol Med""","""['Long noncoding RNA MALAT1 enhances the docetaxel resistance of prostate cancer cells via miR-145-5p-mediated regulation of AKAP12.', 'LncRNA NEAT1 promotes docetaxel resistance in prostate cancer by regulating ACSL4 via sponging miR-34a-5p and miR-204-5p.', 'Exosomal circRNA Scm-like with four malignant brain tumor domains 2 (circ-SFMBT2) enhances the docetaxel resistance of prostate cancer via the microRNA-136-5p/tribbles homolog 1 pathway.', 'Nanoways to overcome docetaxel resistance in prostate cancer.', 'Prostate cancer and microRNAs: New insights into apoptosis.', 'Regulatory roles of ferroptosis-related non-coding RNAs and their research progress in urological malignancies.', 'The circSPON2/miR-331-3p axis regulates PRMT5, an epigenetic regulator of CAMK2N1 transcription and prostate cancer progression.', 'Circular RNA coiled-coil domain containing 66 regulates malignant development of papillary thyroid carcinoma by upregulating La ribonucleoprotein 1 via the sponge effect on miR-129-5p.', 'Expression and regulatory network of miRNAs in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.', 'E2F transcription factor 2-activated DLEU2 contributes to prostate tumorigenesis by upregulating serum and glucocorticoid-induced protein kinase 1.']"""

Despite the evidence that hPIP5K1α plays a role in the development of prostate cancer (PCa), only one inhibitor is known to date. With the aim of identifying new inhibitors, a nonradiometric assay for measurement of the hPIP5K1α enzyme activity was developed. The assay is based on the separation of the fluorescently labeled substrate phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate (PI(4)P) and the resulting product phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2 ) by capillary electrophoresis (CE). Furthermore, an inactive mutant K261A of hPIP5K1α was generated by site-directed mutagenesis and used as a control. Michaelis-Menten analysis revealed a Km value of 21.6 µm and Vmax of 0.65 pmol·min-1 for the cosubstrate ATP. The average Z' value was determined to be 0.86, indicating a high reliability of the assay. An in silico screening of an in-house compound library was performed employing the crystal structure of zebrafish PIP5K1α. By applying this strategy, three compounds with a 2-amino-3-cyano-4H-pyranobenzoquinone scaffold were identified and tested using the CE-based assay. These compounds inhibited hPIP5K1α to > 90% at a concentration of 50 µm. Subsequently, the inhibitory activity of all compounds with a pyranobenzoquinone scaffold (29) was tested on hPIP5K1α. Compound 4-(2-amino-3-cyano-6-hydroxy-5,8-dioxo-7-undecyl-5,8-dihydro-4H-chromen-4-yl)benzoic acid appeared to be the most potent inhibitor of hPIP5K1α identified so far with an IC50 value of 1.55 µm, exhibiting a substrate-competitive mode of action.

Methods:   Five prostate cancer patients underwent 20 fractions of image-guided external-beam radiotherapy on a 1.5 T MR-Linac system. For each patient, a pretreatment T2-weighted three-dimensional (3D) MR imaging (MRI) scan was used to delineate the clinical target volume (CTV) contours. The same scan was repeated during each fraction, with the CTV contour being manually adapted if necessary. A convolutional neural network (CNN) was trained for combined image registration and contour propagation. The network estimated the propagated contour and a deformation field between the two input images. The training set consisted of a synthetically generated ground truth of randomly deformed images and prostate segmentations. We performed a leave-one-out cross-validation on the five patients and propagated the prostate segmentations from the pretreatment to the fraction scans. Three variants of the CNN, aimed at investigating supervision based on optimizing segmentation overlap, optimizing the registration, and a combination of the two were compared to results of the open-source deformable registration software package Elastix.  Results:   The neural networks trained on segmentation overlap or the combined objective achieved significantly better Hausdorff distances between predicted and ground truth contours than Elastix, at the much faster registration speed of 0.5 s.

Here, we applied integrated bioinformatics analysis to identify key prognostic factors for PCa patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS The gene expression data were obtained from the UCSC Xena website. We calculated the differentially expressed genes between PCa tissues and normal controls. Pathway enrichment analyses found cell cycle-related pathways might play crucial roles during PCa tumorigenesis. The genes were assigned into 22 modules established via weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA). RESULTS The results indicated that the purple and red modules were obviously linked to the Gleason score, pathological N, pathological T, recurrence, and recurrence-free survival (RFS). In addition, Kaplan-Meier curve analysis found 8 modules were markedly correlated with RFS, serving as prognostic markers for PCa patients. Then, the hub genes in the most 2 critical modules (purple and red) were visualized by Cytoscape software. Pathway enrichment analyses confirmed the above findings that cell cycle-related pathways might play vital roles during PCa initiation and progression. Lastly, we randomly chose the PILRß (also termed PILRB) in the red module for clinical validation. The immunohistochemistry (IHC) results showed that PILRß was significantly increased in the high-risk PCa population compared with low-/middle-risk patients.

Methods:   This prospective cohort study analyzed patients undergoing prostate biopsy and Phi testing. The primary endpoint was aggressive PCa, defined as biopsy Gleason score ≥ 7. The data about age, total prostate-specific antigen (PSA), percentage of free PSA (%fPSA), and digital rectal examination (DRE) were extracted from the patient files. We divided the patients to the low- and high-risk group. The clinical usefulness of the Phi was assessed by the decision curve analysis. The predictive performance was assessed using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), per-class metrics, and the potential reduction in unnecessary biopsies. The uncertain interval of Phi values was also determined.  Results:   There were 200 men included in the study, 35 (17.5%) of them having aggressive PCa. Important predictors of aggressive PCa were %fPSA, DRE, Phi, and belonging to the high-risk group. With optimal threshold of 30.7, about 32% unnecessary biopsies would be avoided. The optimal threshold of Phi was lower in the high-risk group than in the low-risk group. The AUC for detection of aggressive PCa was 0.791. Per-class metrics showed that the Phi has insufficient diagnostic accuracy. The lower and upper limits of the uncertain interval were 41.8 and 51.4, respectively.

Methods:   A group of 2273 patients with clinically localized prostate cancer between January 2004 and December 2015 at the Yokohama City University hospital were identified. The records of 1817 of these patients, who were followed up for a minimum of 2 years, were reviewed; 462 were treated with RP, 319 with IMRT, and 1036 with BT. The patients were categorized according to the National Comprehensive Cancer Network risk classification criteria, and biochemical outcomes and overall survival rates were examined. Biochemical failure for RP was defined as prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels > 0.2 ng/ml, and for IMRT and BT as nadir PSA level + 2 ng/ml. Propensity scores were calculated using multivariable logistic regression based on covariates, including the patient's age, preoperative PSA, Gleason score, number of positive cores, and clinical T stage.  Results:   Median follow-up was 77 months for the RP, 54 months for IMRT, and 66 months for BT patients. After the propensity scores were adjusted, a total of 372 (186 each) and 598 (299 each) patients were categorized into RP vs IMRT and RP vs BT groups, respectively. Kaplan-Meier analysis did not show any statistically significant differences in terms of overall survival rate between these groups (RP vs IMRT: p = 0.220; RP vs BT: p = 0.429). IMRT was associated with improved biochemical failure-free survival compared to RP in all risk groups (high-risk: p < 0.001; intermediate-risk: p = 0.009; low-risk: p = 0.001), whereas significant differences were observed only in the intermediate-risk group (p = 0.003) within the RP vs BT group.  Conclusion:   The results of our propensity score analysis of mid-term localized prostate cancer treatment outcomes demonstrated no significant differences in the overall survival rate.

We aim to identify which factors most affected choosing and adhering to AS and to quantify their relative importance.  Design, setting and participants:   In 2015, we sent a questionnaire to all Swedish men aged ≤70 years registered in the National Prostate Cancer Register of Sweden who were diagnosed in 2008 with low-risk PC and had undergone prostatectomy, radiotherapy or started on AS.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Logistic regression was used to calculate ORs with 95% CIs for factors potentially affecting choice and adherence to AS.  Results:   1288 out of 1720 men (75%) responded, 451 (35%) chose AS and 837 (65%) underwent curative treatment. Of those starting on AS, 238 (53%) diverted to treatment within 7 years. Most men (83%) choose AS because 'My doctor recommended AS'. Factors associated with choosing AS over treatment were older age (OR 1.81, 95% CI 1.29 to 2.54), a Charlson Comorbidity Index >2 (OR 1.50, 95% CI 1.06 to 2.13), being unaccompanied when notified of the cancer diagnosis (OR 1.45, 95% CI 1.11 to 1.89). Men with a higher prostate-specific antigen (PSA) at the time of diagnosis were less likely to adhere to AS (OR 0.26, 95% CI 0.10 to 0.63). The reason for having treatment after initial AS was 'the PSA level was rising' in 55% and biopsy findings in 36%.  Conclusions:   A doctor's recommendation strongly affects which treatment is chosen for men with low-risk PC. Rising PSA values were the main factor for initiating treatment for men on AS.

Objective:   To evaluate whether an AS regimen based on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or clinical stage changes can detect reclassification to grade group (GG) ≥2 disease compared with scheduled systematic biopsies.  Design, setting, and participants:   We identified a cohort of men initiated on AS between January 2013 and April 2016 at a single tertiary-care center. Patients completed confirmatory testing and prostate MRI prior to enrollment, then underwent laboratory and physical evaluation every 6 mo, MRI every 18 mo, and biopsy every 3yr.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   MRI results were evaluated using composite Likert/Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System v2 scoring. MRI and clinical changes were assessed for association with disease progression. Univariable and multivariable regression models were used to predict upgrading on 3-yr biopsy.  Results and limitations:   At 3yr, of 207 men, 66 (32%) had≥GG2 at biopsy: 55 (83%) with GG2, 10 (15%) with GG3, and one (1.5%) with GG4. Among patients with a 3-yr MRI score of ≥3, 41% had≥GG2 disease, compared with 15% with an MRI score of <3 (p=0.0002). The MRI score increased in 48 men (23%), decreased in 27 (13%), and was unchanged in 132 (64%) men. Increases in MRI score were not associated with reclassification after adjusting for the 3-yr MRI score (p=0.9). Biopsying only for an increased MRI score or clinical stage would avoid 681 biopsies per 1000 men, at the cost of missing ≥GG2 disease in 169 patients.  Conclusions:   An AS strategy that uses MRI or clinical changes to trigger prostate biopsy avoids many biopsies but misses an unacceptable amount of clinically significant disease. Prostate biopsy for men on AS should be performed at scheduled intervals, regardless of stable imaging or examination findings.  Patient summary:   An active surveillance strategy for biopsy based only on increases in magnetic resonance imaging score or clinical stage will avoid many biopsies; however, it will miss many patients with clinically significant prostate cancer.""","""['Gregory T Chesnut', 'Emily A Vertosick', 'Nicole Benfante', 'Daniel D Sjoberg', 'Jonathan Fainberg', 'Taehyoung Lee', 'James Eastham', 'Vincent Laudone', 'Peter Scardino', 'Karim Touijer', 'Andrew Vickers', 'Behfar Ehdaie']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Eur Urol""","""['Re: Gregory T.

It is rarely reported in conventional laparoscopic colorectal surgery, and has not been well recognized by surgeons. Transanal total mesorectal excision (taTME) is an increasingly popular sphincter-preserving surgery for low rectal cancer in recent years. Although the number of cases worldwide is not large, carbon dioxide embolization after operation has been reported successively. Once serious carbon dioxide embolization occurs, the mortality is extremely high. The main related factors of carbon dioxide embolization in taTME include high pressure of pneumoperitoneum, narrow space, abundant blood supply of prostate and vaginal wall, Trendelenburg position, etc. The key of prevention and treatment is to pay attention to the control of related risk factors, identify the early signs of carbon dioxide embolism, and take active and effective symptomatic treatment. Reducing the pressure of pneumoperitoneum perfusion can reduce the occurrence of CO2 embolism. Transesophageal echocardiography is the most sensitive way to monitor intravenously CO2, but it is difficult to carry out in clinical practice. The sudden decrease of end expiratory CO2 partial pressure is an important sign of early detection of CO2 embolism. If there is a suspicious lacuna in the operation, it is possible to reduce or stop the pneumoperitoneum when it is unable to distinguish between normal tissue gap or vascular lumen. If the ""bubble sign"" is observed, CO2 may enter the vein. The risk of venous embolism should be considered.""","""['D S Liu', 'H Zhang']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Zhonghua Wei Chang Wai Ke Za Zhi""","""['CO2 embolism can complicate transanal total mesorectal excision.', 'Carbon Dioxide Embolism Associated With Transanal Total Mesorectal Excision Surgery: A Report From the International Registries.', 'Carbon dioxide embolism during transanal total mesorectal excision (taTME).', 'Transanal total mesorectal excision-a critical appraisal.', 'Transanal total mesorectal excision: A valid option for rectal cancer?', 'Carbon Dioxide Embolism During Transanal Total Mesorectal Excision: Case Report and Literature Review.']"""

When the spot-scanning technique is linked to gating, the beam delivery time with gating can increase, compared to that without gating. We aim to clarify whether the total treatment process can be performed within approximately 30 min (the general time per session in several proton therapy facilities), even for gated-spot-scanning proton-beam delivery with implanted fiducial markers. Data from 152 patients, corresponding to 201 treatment plans and 3577 sessions executed from October 2016 to June 2018, were included in this study. To estimate the treatment process time, we utilized data from proton beam delivery logs during the treatment for each patient. We retrieved data, such as the disease site, total target volume, field size at the isocenter, and the number of layers and spots for each field, from the treatment plans. We quantitatively analyzed the treatment process, which includes the patient load (or setup), bone matching, marker matching, beam delivery, patient unload, and equipment setup, using the data obtained from the log data. Among all the cases, 90 patients used the RGPT system (liver: n = 34; pancreas: n = 5; lung: n = 4; and prostate: n = 47). The mean and standard deviation (SD) of the total treatment process time for the RGPT system was 30.3 ± 7.4 min, while it was 25.9 ± 7.5 min for those without gating treatment, excluding craniospinal irradiation (CSI; head and neck: n = 16, pediatric: n = 31, others: n = 15); for CSI (n = 11) with two or three isocenters, the process time was 59.9 ± 13.9 min.

This study focused on Rad50 expression in tumor samples and its prognostic value for patients with prostate cancer (PCa). In this study, significantly elevated Rad50 expression in PCa tissues compared to normal tissues (P < .01). Five independent Oncomine databases validated significant differential expression of Rad50 (P < .001). Hence, 80 patients with PCa from Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center (FUSCC) and 351 patients with PCa with available protein expression data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) were included to investigate the survival benefit. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were performed to investigate the significance of clinicopathological factors on disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS). Kaplan-Meier analysis indicated that elevated Rad50 protein expression levels significantly correlated with unfavorable DFS (P = .005) in the FUSCC cohort and poorer OS (P = .04) in TCGA cohort. Furthermore, coregulation analysis of proteins indicated that 76 coregulated proteins were associated with Rad50, while 11 most highly involved hub proteins, including Rad50, MRE11A, DUT, POLR3A, MCM3AP, RECQL, PNPT1, RANBP3, DDX1, SNRPB, and UGN, were significantly coregulated in the protein-protein interaction network. Functional enrichment analysis consecutively indicated significant functions and signaling pathways including DNA replication, spliceosome, DNA geometric change, homologous recombination, and G2M checkpoint. This study first reveals that elevated Rad50 expression is significantly associated with aggressive progression and poor survival for patients with PCa.

Based on the role of the immune system in the progression of this disease, immunotherapy using checkpoint blockade has been considered as a therapeutic alternative. Nevertheless, its results do not match up to the positive results in entities like melanoma and other malignancies, suggesting the need to find other therapies to be used alone or in combination. Dendritic cell- (DC-) based vaccines have shown promising results in several types of cancer, such as melanoma, prostate, and lung cancers, due to the essential role played by DCs in the activation of specific T cells, thus using other ways of activating the immune response than immune checkpoint blockade. During the last decade, we have used DC-based vaccines loaded with an allogeneic heat shock-conditioned melanoma cell lysate in the treatment of advanced stage patients in a series of clinical trials. In these studies, 60% of treated patients showed immunological responses which correlated positively with improved survival. Considering the relevance of ovarian cancer and the promising results of our DC-based vaccine, we show here that heat shock-conditioned cell lysates derived from ovarian epithelial carcinoma cell lines have the potential to induce the phenotypic and functional maturation of human DC, which in turn, is able to induce an efficient CD4+ and CD8+ T cell-mediated immune responses against ovarian cancer cell lines in vitro.

The aim of this study was to investigate the association between serum Lp(a) levels and clinicopathological features in patients with PCa.  Methods:   A total of 376 consecutive pathologically diagnosed PCa patients were enrolled and were classified as a low-intermediate-risk group or a high-risk group. The association of Lp(a) and the other lipid parameters including total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), triglycerides (TG), TC/HDL-C, LDL-C/HDL-C, and remnant cholesterol (RC) with clinicopathological parameters was tested by univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses.  Results:   The high-risk PCa patients tended to have higher Lp(a) levels (p = 0.022) while there was no significant difference regarding the other lipid parameters (p > 0.05) compared to low-intermediate-risk counterparts. Patients with PSA ≥ 100 ng/ml had significantly higher Lp(a) levels than subjects with PSA < 100 ng/ml (p = 0.002). Univariate logistic regression analyses revealed that high Lp(a) levels were correlated with high-risk PCa (Q4 vs. Q1, HR = 2.687, 95% CI: 1.113-6.491, p = 0.028), while the other lipid parameters were not correlated with high-risk PCa. In the stepwise multivariate regression analysis, the association between Lp(a) levels and high-risk PCa remained significant (Q4 vs. Q1, HR = 2.890, 95% CI: 1.148-7.274, p = 0.024) after adjusting for confounding factors including age, body mass index, hypertension, diabetes, coronary artery disease, and lipid-lowering drugs.

Tissue samples from 115 patients undergoing radical prostatectomy were included in a tissue microarray comprising (A) tissue from the tumor center, (B) malignant border of the tumor, (C) tumor-adjacent benign tissue, and (D) tumor-distant benign prostatic tissue. Immune reactive scores 0-12 were correlated with clinical data in reference to localization. A meta-analysis of studies investigating the association between biochemical recurrence (BCR) and parameters of the mTOR pathway was conducted. Regardless of the location within the tumor, cancer tissue showed higher expression of mTOR, p-mTOR, and 4EB-P1 compared to benign tissue (p < 0.01). Significant differences in expression between tissue samples from groups C and D were observed for mTOR and p-mTOR. When considering expression according to the pathological stage, we observed lower p-mTOR expression in pT3 vs. pT2 (7.9 and 6.3; p = 0.01). After a median follow-up of 74.5 months (IQR 65.0-84.0), 27 patients (23.47%) developed BCR. Weak staining of mTOR was associated with shorter time to BCR (HR: 2.0; p = 0.049) after correcting for PSA and T stage. However, a significant association of mTOR expression with BCR was found for specimens from the malignant border of the tumor (B) but not the tumor center (A) (p = 0.0034 log rank).

In the present paper, we carried out an extensive experimental work by utilizing microarray gene expression data, as well as in vitro and in vivo models of prostate cancer (PCa). Our results demonstrated that (i) CLU expression is significantly downregulated in human PCa and inversely correlates with the expression of p65 in metastases; (ii) CLU overexpression in PCa cells reduces the Ser536 phosphorylation of p65, inhibits NF-κB nuclear translocation, and reduces the transcription of matrix metalloproteinase-9 and metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-9 and MMP-2). Conversely, CLU silencing promotes NF-κB activation and transcriptional upregulation of MMP-9; and (iii) expression and activity of MMP-2 and MMP-9 are increased in CLU-/- mice (CLUKO) and in TRAMP/CLUKO mice in comparison to their relative Clu+/+ littermates.

While resident stem cells are relatively quiescent with niche restraints in adult tissues, they enter the cell cycle in anchor-free three-dimensional (3D) culture and undergo both symmetric and asymmetric cell division, giving rise to both stem and progenitor cells. The latter proliferate rapidly and are the major cell population at various stages of lineage commitment, forming heterogeneous spheroids. Using primary normal human prostate epithelial cells (HPrEC), a spheroid-based, label-retention assay was developed that permits the identification and functional isolation of the spheroid-initiating stem cells at a single cell resolution. HPrEC or cell lines are two-dimensionally (2D) cultured with BrdU for 10 days to permit its incorporation into the DNA of all dividing cells, including self-renewing stem cells. Wash out commences upon transfer to the 3D culture for 5 days, during which stem cells self-renew through asymmetric division and initiate spheroid formation. While relatively quiescent daughter stem cells retain BrdU-labeled parental DNA, the daughter progenitors rapidly proliferate, losing the BrdU label. BrdU can be substituted with CFSE or Far Red pro-dyes, which permit live stem cell isolation by FACS. Stem cell characteristics are confirmed by in vitro spheroid formation, in vivo tissue regeneration assays, and by documenting their symmetric/asymmetric cell divisions. The isolated label-retaining stem cells can be rigorously interrogated by downstream molecular and biologic studies, including RNA-seq, ChIP-seq, single cell capture, metabolic activity, proteome profiling, immunocytochemistry, organoid formation, and in vivo tissue regeneration. Importantly, this marker-free functional stem cell isolation approach identifies stem-like cells from fresh cancer specimens and cancer cell lines from multiple organs, suggesting wide applicability. It can be used to identify cancer stem-like cell biomarkers, screen pharmaceuticals targeting cancer stem-like cells, and discover novel therapeutic targets in cancers.""","""['Wen-Yang Hu', 'Dan-Ping Hu', 'Lishi Xie', 'Lynn A Birch', 'Gail S Prins']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""J Vis Exp""","""['Isolation and functional interrogation of adult human prostate epithelial stem cells at single cell resolution.', 'Doublecortin and CaM kinase-like-1 and leucine-rich-repeat-containing G-protein-coupled receptor mark quiescent and cycling intestinal stem cells, respectively.', 'The regenerative nidi of the locust midgut as a model to study epithelial cell differentiation from stem cells.', 'Metabolism and the Control of Cell Fate Decisions and Stem Cell Renewal.', 'Filling the Gaps between the In Vivo and In Vitro Microenvironment: Engineering of Spheroids for Stem Cell Technology.', 'Novel Dormancy Mechanism of Castration Resistance in Bone Metastatic Prostate Cancer Organoids.', 'Keratin Profiling by Single-Cell RNA-Sequencing Identifies Human Prostate Stem Cell Lineage Hierarchy and Cancer Stem-Like Cells.', 'Effects of Inorganic Arsenic on Human Prostate Stem-Progenitor Cell Transformation, Autophagic Flux Blockade, and NRF2 Pathway Activation.']"""

Methods:   Patients with high-risk prostate cancer without metastatic disease on conventional staging referred for Ga68 PSMA PET/CT at Mercy Radiology, Auckland, New Zealand, were prospectively recruited. Conventional staging was double read in a blinded fashion by oncology fellowship-trained radiologists, who were also experienced in PET/CT, followed by interpretation of the PSMA PET/CT by the same radiologists. Confirmation of changes in management decision was obtained from the treating surgeon and multidisciplinary team meeting records. Ethical approval was obtained from the Health and Disability Ethics Committee. All patients gave written informed consent.  Results:   A total of 49 patients were scanned. Three who were otherwise eligible for radical prostatectomy elected alternative treatments, leaving 46 patients included for analysis in the study. The addition of PSMA PET/CT was associated with highly statistically significant changes in both staging and management. The stage was changed in 32.6% (95% CI 20.8-47.1%, P < 0.001) patients upstaging in 60% and downstaging in 40%; clinical management in 34.8% (95% CI 22.6-49.3%; P < 0.001), with intramodality change in 25% and intermodality change in 75%. Factors predictive of a change in management with PSMA PET/CT included higher Gleason score and a greater proportion of prostatic cores positive for tumour.

Methods:   We evaluated second primary papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) risk among 3,175,216 ≥ 1-year adult survivors of non-thyroid malignancies from US population-based cancer registries (2000-2015), using standardized incidence ratios (SIRs). Because heightened surveillance may increase detection of indolent thyroid tumors and earlier detection of advanced tumors, we examined SIRs by PTC stage and time since first cancer (latency).  Results:   SIRs for second primary PTC (N = 4333) were statistically-significantly 1.2-3.5-fold elevated overall and after 23/27 first cancer types evaluated, with generally similar risks for localized and regional/distant PTC. SIRs for regional/distant PTC (N = 1501) were highest after pancreatic (SIR = 3.7; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.9-6.5) and soft tissue (SIR = 4.2; 95%CI = 2.8-6.2) cancers, followed by melanoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL), diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, and larynx, kidney, and brain/central nervous system (SIRs = 2.0-2.9) cancers. SIRs typically decreased with increasing latency but remained statistically-significantly elevated for regional/distant-PTC ≥5 years after diagnosis of cancers of the rectum, pancreas, lung/bronchus, soft tissue, female breast, uterine corpus, prostate, and kidney, and after melanoma, Hodgkin lymphoma, CLL/SLL, and follicular lymphoma. Neither total nor regional/distant PTC were clearly associated with initial course of radiotherapy or chemotherapy.

Furthermore, based on six rearrangement signatures, tumors were assigned to five subgroups that revealed different biological mechanisms. Of which, tandem duplicator subgroup harbored all CDK12 mutations, small deletor subgroup owned 75% TP53 changes, and large deletor subgroup had 66.7% SPOP mutations.

Patients and methods:   PRO-CAPRI is an observational, prospective study in 10 hospitals in the Netherlands. Patients with mCRPC completed the EQ-5D, European Organization for the Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30), and Brief Pain Inventory-Short Form (BPI-SF) every 3 months and European Organization for the Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire-Prostate Cancer Module (EORTC QLQ-PR25) every 6 months for a maximum of 2 years. Subgroups were identified based on chemotherapy pretreatment. Outcomes were generic, cancer-specific, and prostate cancer-specific HRQoL and self-reported pain. Descriptive statistics were performed including changes over time and minimal important differences (MID) between subgroups.  Results:   In total, 151 included patients answered 873 questionnaires. The median follow-up from the start of the study was 19.5 months, and 84% were treated with at least 1 life-prolonging agent. Overall, patients were in good clinical condition (Eatern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0-1 in 78%) with normal baseline hemoglobin, lactate dehydrogenase, and alkaline phosphatase. At inclusion, generic HRQoL was high with a mean EQ visual analog score of 73.2 out of 100. The lowest scores were reported on role and physical functioning (mean scores of 69 and 76 of 100, respectively), and fatigue, pain, and insomnia were the most impaired domains. These domains deteriorated in > 50% of patients.  Conclusion:   Although most patients were treated with new treatments during follow-up, mCRPC has a negative impact on HRQoL with deterioration in all domains over time, especially role and physical functioning.

The objective of our study was to investigate the molecular mechanism by which C-PC induces apoptosis in monotherapy as well as in combination treatment with a known chemotherapeutic drug named Topotecan (TPT) using prostate cancer cells (LNCaP). To determine the intracellular mechanism of action, we analyzed the gene expression profile of C-PC treated cells using human apoptosis RT2 profiler PCR array, which indicated that C-PC was able to regulate both anti- and pro-apoptotic genes significantly. Detailed analysis revealed increases in the levels of Bax, Apaf-1 (pro-apoptotic proteins) along with the activation of the key apoptotic proteases such as caspase-8, caspase-9, and caspase-3. Similarly, analysis of anti-apoptotic proteins demonstrated a decrease in the expression of Bcl-2, Mcl-1, and survivin. Results from the whole-cell incubation studies indicated that C-PC was only binding to the plasma membrane-associated receptor proteins. LNCaP cells treated with C-PC alone and in combination with TPT showed increased expression of the death receptor FAS (also known as FAS or CD95) along with cleaved PARP, confirming its importance. Our study is significant since it is providing greater insight into the apoptotic mechanisms triggered by C-PC as well as emphasizing the involvement of FAS in mediating its effects. Furthermore, our results with combination treatments suggest that-PC could improve the anticancer effects of drugs such as TPT that are currently used for cancer treatments. In addition, use of C-PC in combination can also diminish the side effects resulting from conventional chemotherapeutic agents such as TPT.""","""['Paramjot Kaur', 'Sivanesan Dhandayuthapani', 'Thiagarajan Venkatesan', 'Miroslav Gantor', 'Appu Rathinavelu']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Bioorg Med Chem""","""['Phycocyanin induces apoptosis and enhances the effect of topotecan on prostate cell line LNCaP.', 'Molecular mechanisms in C-Phycocyanin induced apoptosis in human chronic myeloid leukemia cell line-K562.', 'Development of a novel method for the purification of C-phycocyanin pigment from a local cyanobacterial strain Limnothrix sp.

A physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model for PSMA-specific ligands was implemented. Thirteen virtual patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer were analysed. Simulations were performed for different combinations of association rates kon (0.1-0.01 L/nmol/min), dissociation rates koff (0.1-0.0001 min-1), internalization rates λint (0.01-0.0001 min-1) and ligand amounts (1-1000 nmol).

The effect of the investigated parameters on therapy were larger compared to imaging. For imaging, the combination of properties leading to the highest tumour uptake was kon = 0.1 L/nmol/min, koff = 0.01 min-1 for typical ligand amounts (1-10 nmol). For therapy, the higher the internalization rate, the larger was the required ligand amount for optimal tumour-to-kidney ratios. The higher the affinity, the more important was the choice of the optimal ligand amount. PBPK modelling provides insight into the pharmacokinetics of PSMA-specific ligands.

Methods:   All cancer cases (excluding non-melanoma of skin) for the years 2003-2012 were retrieved from the NCRU's database (n = 1,459,851). Age-standardized incidence rates (ASRs) were estimated and the numbers of new cases and incidence rates predicted for 2022 using age-period modeling.  Results:   ASR increased from 2003 to 2012 for most cancers except lip and stomach cancers (in both sexes) and laryngeal and lung cancers (in males). Assuming these trends will continue, lung cancer will remain the most common male cancer in 2022 (ASR 40.5/100,000), followed by prostate cancer (36.8/100,000), colorectal cancer (34.6/100,000), and cancers of the oral cavity and pharynx (18.5/100,000). In females, the order of the four most common cancers will not change in 2022 compared with 2012, with cervical cancer remaining the fourth most common cancer (17.5/100,000). We predict an overall increase of 18 % in the number of cancer cases in Ukraine (relative to 2012) to 179,493 cases in 2022.  Conclusion:   The anticipated increase in the number of cancer patients in Ukraine clearly has knock-on effects on a healthcare system undergoing reforms. Tobacco control appears to be the only functioning aspect of cancer prevention in the country, and there is a need for a broader national cancer control plan. The continued monitoring and evaluation of implemented cancer control measures by the NCRU will help prioritize targets and allocate future resources to cancer services.""","""['Anton Ryzhov', 'Freddie Bray', 'Jacques Ferlay', 'Zoya Fedorenko', 'Liudmyla Goulak', 'Yevgeniy Gorokh', 'Olena Soumkina', 'Yuriy Michailovich', 'Ariana Znaor']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Cancer Epidemiol""","""['Evaluation of data quality at the National Cancer Registry of Ukraine.', 'Italian cancer figures--Report 2015: The burden of rare cancers in Italy.', 'Cancer in Iran 2008 to 2025: Recent incidence trends and short-term predictions of the future burden.', 'Italian cancer figures, report 2012: Cancer in children and adolescents.', 'Cancer incidence and mortality patterns in Europe: Estimates for 40 countries and 25 major cancers in 2018.', 'Cancer Care to Ukrainian War Refugees in Poland.', 'The Effects of the Ukrainian Conflict on Oncological Care: The Latest State of the Art.', 'What challenges does the humanitarian crisis and large number of refugees from Ukraine pose for Polish oncology?', 'Association Between Statins and the Risk of Kidney Cancer Incidence and Mortality Using the Korean National Health Insurance Claims Database.', 'Radiation Oncology in a Humanitarian Emergency: Experience with Ukrainian Refugees at 2 Cancer Centers in Poland and Italy.']"""

However, the molecular mechanisms underlying prostate cancer metastasis are not fully demonstrated. In this study, EMT was induced by interferon-γ (IFN-γ) in PC-3M IE8 cells. High-throughput sequencing was used to screen the differentially expressed circular RNAs (circRNAs) and miRNAs in the cells with or without IFN-γ treatment. EMT-related circRNAs and miRNAs were further identified by quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR). In addition, the relationships among circRNAs, miRNAs, and mRNA were predicted. After cells were treated with IFN-γ, western blot analysis was conducted to detect the expression levels of EMT markers. E-cadherin expression levels were found to be downregulated, and Twist expression levels were found to be upregulated. Our results also found that IFN-γ promoted PC-3M IE8 cell migration and invasion, indicating that IFN-γ could induce EMT in PC-3M IE8 cells. Furthermore, high-throughput sequencing results revealed 827 upregulated and 1279 downregulated circRNAs and 39 upregulated and 2076 downregulated miRNAs in the IFN-γ group compared with the control group. KEGG analysis showed that both differentially expressed circRNAs and differentially expressed miRNAs were enriched in the MAPK signaling pathway related to EMT. Furthermore, the qPCR results revealed that the expression of hsa_circ_0001085, hsa_circ_0004916, hsa_circ_0001165, hsa-miR-196b-5p, and hsa-miR-187-3p in the IFN-γ group was consistent with the sequencing results. hsa_circ_0001165 and hsa_circ_0001085 were used to construct the network of circRNA-miRNA-mRNA. It was found that hsa_circ_0001165 may regulate TNF expression through hsa-miR-187-3p to induce EMT in prostate cancer cells. In addition, hsa_circ_0001085 may indirectly regulate the PI3K-Akt signaling and TGF-β signaling pathways through hsa-miR-196b-5p and the MAPK signaling pathway through has-miR-451a, which played a regulatory role in prostate cancer cells in the EMT induction model.

Most FMs appear as small signal voids in MRI images making them difficult to differentiate from tissue heterogeneities such as calcifications. In this study we use quantitative metrics to objectively evaluate the visibility of FMs in 27 patients and an anthropomorphic phantom with a variety of standard clinical MRI pulse sequences and commercially available FMs. FM visibility was quantified using the local contrast-to-noise-ratio (lCNR), the difference between the 80th and 20th percentile iso-intensity FM volumes (V fall) and the largest iso-intensity volume that can be distinguished from background: apparent-marker-volume (AMV). A larger lCNR and AMV, and smaller V fall represents a more easily identifiable FM. The number of non-marker objects visualized by each pulse sequence was calculated using FM-derived template-matching. The FM-based target-registration-error (TRE) between each MRI and the planning-CT image was calculated. Fiducial marker visibility was rated by two medical physicists with over three years of experience examining MRI-only prostate simulation images. The rater's classification accuracy was quantified using the F 1 score, which is the harmonic mean of the rater's precision and recall. These quantitative metrics and human observer ratings were used to evaluate FM identifiability in images from nine subtypes of T 1-weighted, T 2-weighted and gradient echo (GRE) pulse sequences in a 27-patient study. A phantom study was conducted to quantify the visibility of 8 commercially available FMs. In the patient study, the largest mean lCNR and AMV and, smallest normalized V fall were produced by the 3.0 T multiple-echo GRE pulse sequence (T 1-VIBE, 2° flip angle, 1.23 ms and 2.45 ms echo-times). This pulse sequence produced no false marker detections and TREs less than 2 mm in the left-right, anterior-posterior and cranial-caudal directions, respectively. Human observers rated the 1.23 ms echo-time GRE images with the best average marker visibility score of 100% and an F 1 score of 1. In the phantom study, the Gold-Anchor GA-200X-20-B (deployed in a folded configuration) produced the largest sequence averaged lCNR and AMV measurements at 16.1 and 16.7 mm3, respectively. Using quantitative visibility and distinguishability metrics and human observer ratings, the patient study demonstrated that multiple-echo GRE images produced the best gold FM visibility and distinguishability. The phantom study demonstrated that markers manufactured from platinum or iron-doped gold quantitatively produced superior visibility compared to their pure gold counterparts.""","""['Kamal Singhrao', 'Dan Ruan', 'Jie Fu', 'Yu Gao', 'Geraldine Chee', 'Yingli Yang', 'Christopher King', 'Peng Hu', 'Amar U Kishan', 'John H Lewis']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Phys Med Biol""","""['Visibility of an iron-containing fiducial marker in magnetic resonance imaging for high-precision external beam prostate radiotherapy.', 'A generative adversarial network-based (GAN-based) architecture for automatic fiducial marker detection in prostate MRI-only radiotherapy simulation images.', 'Visibility and artifacts of gold fiducial markers used for image guided radiation therapy of pancreatic cancer on MRI.', 'Fiducial markers visibility and artefacts in prostate cancer radiotherapy multi-modality imaging.', 'Fiducial marker guided prostate radiotherapy: a review.']"""

Recently, long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) and Kruppel-like factor 4 (KLF4) have been reported to participate in the biology of multiple cancers including prostate cancer. Here, this study aimed to explore the possible role of LINC00673 in prostate cancer via KLF4 gene promoter methylation. Microarray-based gene expression profiling of prostate cancer was employed to identify differentially expressed lncRNAs and genes, after which the expression of LINC00673 and KLF4 in prostate cancer tissues was determined using RT-qPCR. Next, the relationship between LINC00673 and KLF4 was evaluated using in silico analysis. Further, the effect of LINC00673 and KLF4 on cell proliferation and drug resistance of transfected cells was examined with gain- and loss-of-function experimentation. It was found that LINC00673 was highly expressed, while KLF4 was poorly expressed in prostate cancer tissues. Additionally, LINC00673 could bind to KLF4 gene promoter region and recruit methyltransferase to the KLF4 gene promoter region. Moreover, LINC00673 silencing was demonstrated to reduce methylation of the KLF4 gene promoter to elevate the expression of KLF4, thus suppressing the proliferation and drug resistance of prostate cancer cells. In summary, LINC00673 silencing could drive demethylation of the KLF4 gene promoter and thus inhibit the proliferation and drug resistance of prostate cancer cells, suggesting that silencing of LINC00673 and elevation of KLF4 could serve as tumour suppressors in prostate cancer.""","""['Zhenming Jiang', 'Yuxi Zhang', 'Xi Chen', 'Pingeng Wu', 'Dong Chen']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""J Cell Mol Med""","""['Long non-coding RNA BZRAP1-AS1 silencing suppresses tumor angiogenesis in hepatocellular carcinoma by mediating THBS1 methylation.', 'lncRNA LINC00673 induces proliferation, metastasis and epithelial-mesenchymal transition in thyroid carcinoma via Kruppel-like factor\xa02.', 'Impairment of IGF2 gene expression in prostate cancer is triggered by epigenetic dysregulation of IGF2-DMR0 and its interaction with KLF4.', 'A review of linc00673 as a novel lncRNA for tumor regulation.', 'Role of noncoding RNA in drug resistance of prostate cancer.', 'KLF4 transcription factor in tumorigenesis.', 'Importance of long non-coding RNAs in the pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment of prostate cancer.', 'Insights into the role of long non-coding RNAs in DNA methylation mediated transcriptional regulation.', 'Genetic Polymorphisms of lncRNA LINC00673 as Predictors of Hepatocellular Carcinoma Progression in an Elderly Population.', 'Long non-coding RNA SNHG3 promotes prostate cancer progression by sponging microRNA-1827.']"""

Breast cancer risk predictions can inform screening and preventative actions. Previous works found that adding inputs to the widely-used Gail model improved its ability to predict breast cancer risk. However, these models used simple statistical architectures and the additional inputs were derived from costly and / or invasive procedures. By contrast, we developed machine learning models that used highly accessible personal health data to predict five-year breast cancer risk. We created machine learning models using only the Gail model inputs and models using both Gail model inputs and additional personal health data relevant to breast cancer risk. For both sets of inputs, six machine learning models were trained and evaluated on the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial data set. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve metric quantified each model's performance. Since this data set has a small percentage of positive breast cancer cases, we also reported sensitivity, specificity, and precision. We used Delong tests (p < 0.05) to compare the testing data set performance of each machine learning model to that of the Breast Cancer Risk Prediction Tool (BCRAT), an implementation of the Gail model. None of the machine learning models with only BCRAT inputs were significantly stronger than the BCRAT. However, the logistic regression, linear discriminant analysis, and neural network models with the broader set of inputs were all significantly stronger than the BCRAT. These results suggest that relative to the BCRAT, additional easy-to-obtain personal health inputs can improve five-year breast cancer risk prediction. Our models could be used as non-invasive and cost-effective risk stratification tools to increase early breast cancer detection and prevention, motivating both immediate actions like screening and long-term preventative measures such as hormone replacement therapy and chemoprevention.""","""['Gigi F Stark', 'Gregory R Hart', 'Bradley J Nartowt', 'Jun Deng']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Machine learning techniques for personalized breast cancer risk prediction: comparison with the BCRAT and BOADICEA models.', 'Prospective validation of the NCI Breast Cancer Risk Assessment Tool (Gail Model) on 40,000 Australian women.', 'Breast cancer risk prediction in women aged 35-50\u2009years: impact of including sex hormone concentrations in the Gail model.', 'Improvement in risk prediction, early detection and prevention of breast cancer in the NHS Breast Screening Programme and family history clinics: a dual cohort study.', 'An Assessment of the Predictive Performance of Current Machine Learning-Based Breast Cancer Risk Prediction Models: Systematic Review.', 'Machine Learning and AI in Cancer Prognosis, Prediction, and Treatment Selection: A Critical Approach.', 'Molecular Characterization and Landscape of Breast cancer Models from a multi-omics Perspective.', 'The innovative model based on artificial intelligence algorithms to predict recurrence risk of patients with postoperative breast cancer.', 'Statistical biopsy: An emerging screening approach for early detection of cancers.', 'Evaluation of machine learning algorithms for the prognosis of breast cancer from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database.']"""

Design, setting, and participants:   A cohort study of 3225 white men was conducted as a secondary analysis of the Reduction by Dutasteride of Prostate Cancer Events (REDUCE) chemoprevention trial, a 4-year, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled multicenter study conducted from March 2003 to April 2009 to evaluate the safety and efficacy of dutasteride in reducing PCa events. Participants were confirmed to be cancer free by prostate biopsy (6-12 cores) within 6 months prior to the study and underwent 10 core biopsies every 2 years per protocol. The dates for performing data analysis were from July 2016 to October 2019.  Interventions:   A well-established, population-standardized GRS was calculated for each participant based on 110 known PCa risk-associated single-nucleotide polymorphisms, which is a relative risk compared with the general population. Men were classified into 3 GRS risk groups based on predetermined cutoff values: low (<0.50), average (0.50-1.49), and high (≥1.50).  Main outcomes and measures:   Prostate cancer diagnosis-free survival among men of different risk groups.  Results:   Among 3225 men (median age, 63 years [interquartile range, 58-67 years]) in the study, 683 (21%) were classified as low risk, 1937 (60%) as average risk, and 605 (19%) as high risk based on GRS alone. In comparison, 2789 (86%) were classified as low or average risk and 436 (14%) as high risk based on FH alone. Men in higher GRS risk groups had a PCa diagnosis-free survival rate that was worse than that of those in the lower GRS risk group (χ2 = 53.3; P < .001 for trend) and in participants with a negative FH of PCa (χ2 = 45.5; P < .001 for trend). Combining GRS and FH further stratified overall genetic risk, indicating that 957 men (30%) were at high genetic risk (either high GRS or positive FH), 1667 men (52%) were at average genetic risk (average GRS and negative FH), and 601 men (19%) were at low genetic risk (low GRS and negative FH). The median PCa diagnosis-free survival was 74 years (95% CI, 73-75 years) for men at high genetic risk, 77 years (95% CI, 75 to >80 years) for men at average genetic risk, and more than 80 years (95% CI, >80 to >80 years) for men at low genetic risk. In contrast, the median PCa diagnosis-free survival was 73 years (95% CI, 71-76 years) for men with a positive FH and 77 years (95% CI, 76-79 years) for men with a negative FH.  Conclusions and relevance:   This study suggests that a GRS is significantly associated with patient age at PCa diagnosis. Combining FH and GRS may better stratify inherited risk than FH alone for developing personalized PCa screening strategies.""","""['Rong Na', 'Craig Labbate', 'Hongjie Yu', 'Zhuqing Shi', 'Richard J Fantus', 'Chi-Hsiung Wang', 'Gerald L Andriole', 'William B Isaacs', 'S Lilly Zheng', 'Brian T Helfand', 'Jianfeng Xu']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""JAMA Netw Open""","""['Adding genetic risk score to family history identifies twice as many high-risk men for prostate cancer: Results from the prostate cancer prevention trial.', 'Population-standardized genetic risk score: the SNP-based method of choice for inherited risk assessment of prostate cancer.', 'Alcohol intake increases high-grade prostate cancer risk among men taking dutasteride in the REDUCE trial.', 'Clinical validity and utility of genetic risk scores in prostate cancer.', 'A comparison of genetic risk score with family history for estimating prostate cancer risk.', 'Relationship between Arachidonate 5-Lipoxygenase-Activating Protein Gene and Peripheral Arterial Disease in Elderly Patients Undergoing General Surgery: A Retrospective Observational Study.', 'Reliability of Ancestry-specific Prostate Cancer Genetic Risk Score in Four Racial and Ethnic Populations.', 'Family History of Prostate and Breast Cancer Integrated with a Polygenic Risk Score Identifies Men at Highest Risk of Dying from Prostate Cancer before Age 75 Years.', 'Polygenic risk for prostate cancer: Decreasing relative risk with age but little impact on absolute risk.', 'Inherited risk assessment and its clinical utility for predicting prostate cancer from diagnostic prostate biopsies.']"""

This study aimed to compare the short-term therapeutic outcomes of robotic-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (RALP) for oligometastatic prostate cancer (OPC) vs. localized PCa using propensity score matching.  Methods:   Totally 508 consecutive patients underwent RALP as a first-line treatment. The patients were divided into two groups according to oligometastatic state: the OPC group (n = 41) or the localized PCa group (n = 467). Oligometastatic disease was defined as the presence of two or fewer suspicious lesions. The association between the oligometastatic state and therapeutic outcomes of RALP was evaluated, including biochemical recurrence (BCR) and overall survival (OS). A Cox proportional hazards model was used to assess the possible risk factors for BCR.  Results:   Totally 41 pairs of patients were matched. The median operative time, the median blood loss, the overall positive surgical margin rate, the median post-operative hospital stays, and the post-operative urinary continence recovery rate between the two groups showed no statistical significance. The 4-year BCR survival rates of the OPC group and localized PCa group were 56.7% and 60.8%, respectively, without a significant difference (P = 0.804). The 5-year OS rates were 96.3% and 100%, respectively (P = 0.326). Additionally, the results of Cox regression showed that oligometastatic state was not an independent risk factor for BCR (P = 0.682).  Conclusions:   Our findings supported the safety and effectiveness of RALP in OPC. Additionally, oligometastatic state and sites did not have an adverse effect on BCR independently.""","""['Huan Chen', 'Min Qu', 'Bi-Jun Lian', 'Hai-Feng Wang', 'Yan Wang', 'Zhen-Yang Dong', 'Feng Zhu', 'Zhen-Kai Shi', 'Ze-Peng Jia', 'Ying-Hao Sun', 'Xu Gao']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Chin Med J (Engl)""","""['Can robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (RALP) be performed very soon after biopsy?', 'Modified Apical Dissection and Lateral Prostatic Fascia Preservation Improves Early Postoperative Functional Recovery in Robotic-assisted Laparoscopic Radical Prostatectomy: Results from a Propensity Score-matched Analysis.', 'Comparing High-Intensity Focal Ultrasound Hemiablation to Robotic Radical Prostatectomy in the Management of Unilateral Prostate Cancer: A Matched-Pair Analysis.', 'Comparison of perioperative, functional, and oncologic outcomes between standard laparoscopic and robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy: a systemic review and meta-analysis.', 'Optimal Treatment for Patients with Oligometastatic Prostate Cancer.']"""

The expression of GHSR is significantly different in normal and prostate cancer (PC) tissues in humans. It is important to find an effective diagnostic method for the diagnosis and prognosis of invasive PC/neuroendocrine prostate cancer (NEPC).  Methods:   GHRL and GHSR mRNA levels were determined by a quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction in PC tissues. The expression of GHRL and GHSR proteins was assessed by Western blot assay and immunohistochemistry. A GHRL polypeptide probe was synthesized by standard solid-phase polypeptide synthesis, and labeled with Alexa Fluor 660. Confocal microscopy was used to capture fluorescence images. Living imaging analysis showed tumor areas of different invasiveness in mice models.  Results:   The levels of GHRL and GHSR copy number amplification and mRNA expression were increased in invasive PC/NEPC, and the protein expression levels of GHRL and GHSR were similarly increased in NEPC. The GHRL polypeptide probe could effectively bind to GHSR. In PC3 cells, it was found that the GHRL probe specifically binds to GHSR on the cell membrane and accumulates in the cells through internalization after binding. Live imaging in mice models showed that there were different signal intensities in tumor areas with different invasiveness.

Therefore, we hypothesised that ADT improves the performance of PSMA-PET imaging in primary staging of prostate cancer. The purpose of the study was to demonstrate the time course effect of ADT on PSMA uptake in different types of metastatic lesions evaluated with 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/MRI.  Methods:   Nine men with treatment-naïve prostate cancer were enrolled to a prospective, registered (NCT03313726) clinical trial. A 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/MRI was performed once before and 3 times post-ADT (degarelix, Firmagon). Change of maximum standardised uptake values (SUVmax) in prostate, lymph nodes, bone metastases, and physiologically PSMA-avid organs were evaluated in a time frame of 1-8 weeks.  Results:   All patients reached castration levels within 10 days, and 50% decrease in prostate-specific antigen (PSA) concentration was observed 14 days post-ADT. A heterogeneous increase in PSMA uptake was observed 3 to 4 weeks post-ADT. This phenomenon was definitively more evident in bone metastases: 13 (57%) of the metastasis, with a mean (range) SUVmax increase of 77% (8-238%). In one patient, already having bone metastases at baseline, three new bone metastases were observed post-ADT. Of lesions with reduced SUVmax, none disappeared.  Conclusions:   Both in patient and region level, increase in PSMA uptake post-ADT is heterogenous and is seen most evidently in bone metastases. Preliminary results on a small cohort of patients suggest the clinical impact of ADT on improving the performance of 68Ga-PSMA PET in staging seems to be minor. However, the optimal imaging time point might be 3 to 4 weeks post-ADT. Since none of the metastases with decreasing SUVmax disappeared, it seems that short-term usage of ADT does not interfere with the interpretation of 68Ga-PSMA PET.

Methods and materials:   The phantom was designed with 3D printed hollow cubes in the centre. These cubes were filled with gel to mimic the prostate gland and two parallel PVC rods were used to mimic bones in the pelvic region. Each cube was filled with gelatine and three unique FMs were positioned with a clinically-relevant spatial distribution. The FMs investigated were; Gold Marker (GM) CIVCO, GM RiverPoint, GM Gold Anchor (GA) line and ball shape, and polymer marker (PM) from CIVCO. The phantom was scanned using several imaging modalities typically used to image prostate cancer patients; MRI, CT, CBCT, planar kV-pair, ExacTrac, 6MV, 2.5MV and integrated EPID imaging. The visibility of the markers and any observed artefacts in the phantom were compared to in-vivo scans of prostate cancer patients with FMs.  Results:   All GMs were visible in volumetric scans, however, they also had the most visible artefacts on CT and CBCT scans, with the magnitude of artefacts increasing with FM size. PM FMs had the least visible artefacts in volumetric scans but they were not visible on portal images and had poor visibility on lateral kV images. The smallest diameter GMs (GA) were the most difficult GMs to identify on lateral kV images.  Conclusion:   The choice between different FMs is also dependent on the adopted IGRT strategy.

Methods:   We retrospectively assessed 26 bone scans from 26 patients with known prostate cancer bone metastases and 13 control patients with benign spinal and pelvic osteoarthritic changes without known neoplastic disease. Quantitative SPECT/CT (xSPECT, Siemens Symbia Intevo, Erlangen, Germany) was performed and standardized uptake values (SUVs) were quantified with measurements of SUVmax and SUVmean (g/mL) in all bone metastases for the prostate cancer group and in spinal and pelvic osteoarthritic changes for the control group. We used receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves to determine the optimum SUVmax cutoff value to distinguish between bone metastases and benign spinal and pelvic lesions.  Results:   In total, 264 prostate cancer bone metastases were analyzed, showing a mean SUVmax and SUVmean of 34.6 ± 24.6 and 20.8 ± 14.7 g/mL, respectively. In 24 spinal and pelvic osteoarthritic lesions, mean SUVmax and SUVmean were 14.2 ± 3.8 and 8.9 ± 2.2 g/mL, respectively. SUVmax and SUVmean were both significantly different between the bone metastases and osteoarthritic groups (p ≤ 0.0001). Using a SUVmax cutoff of 19.5 g/mL for prostate cancer bone metastases in the spine and pelvis, sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values were 87, 92, 99 and 49%, respectively.  Conclusion:   This study showed significant differences in quantitative 99mTc-DPD uptake on bone SPECT/CT between prostate cancer bone metastases and spinal and pelvic osteoarthritic changes, with higher SUVmax and SUVmean in metastases.

Mice represent a validated host, but their use is limited by the elevated experimental costs and low throughput. To overcome these restrictions, zebrafish larvae might represent a valuable alternative. Their small size and transparency allow the tracking of transplanted cells. Therefore, tumor growth and early steps of metastasis, which are difficult to evaluate in mice, can be addressed. In spite of its advantages, the use of this model has been hindered by lack of experimental homogeneity and validation. Considering these facts, the aim of our work was to standardize, automate, and validate a zebrafish larvae xenograft assay with increased translatability and higher drug screening throughput. The ZeOncoTest reliability is based on the optimization of different experimental parameters, such as cell labeling, injection site, automated individual sample image acquisition, and analysis. This workflow implementation finally allows a higher precision and experimental throughput increase, when compared to previous reports. The approach was validated with the breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231, the colorectal cancer cells HCT116, and the prostate cancer cells PC3; and known drugs, respectively RKI-1447, Docetaxel, and Mitoxantrone. The results recapitulate growth and invasion for all tested tumor cells, along with expected efficacy of the compounds.

Here, we noted that DDZ abrogated STAT3 activation (both constitutive as well as inducible) at Tyr705 and Ser727 in MM cells. Additionally, DDZ mitigated the phosphorylation of STAT3 upstream Janus-activated kinases (JAK1/2) and c-Src kinases. Pervanadate (tyrosine phosphatase blocker) exposure altered the DDZ-induced inhibition of STAT3 activation, thus affecting the action of this phytoestrogen on apoptosis. Moreover, DDZ impeded proliferation and augmented the apoptotic effects of bortezomib (Bor) in MM cells.

Recent studies have shown that prostate cancer can originate from undifferentiated, rare, stem cell-like populations within the heterogeneous tumor mass, which play seminal roles in tumor formation, maintenance of tumor homeostasis and initiation of metastases. These cells possess enhanced propensity toward chemoresistance and may serve as a prognostic factor for prostate cancer recurrence. Despite extensive studies, selective targeted therapies against these stem cell-like populations are limited and more detailed experiments are required to develop novel targeted therapeutics. We now show that MDA-9/Syntenin/SDCBP (MDA-9) is a critical regulator of survival, stemness and chemoresistance in prostate cancer stem cells (PCSCs). MDA-9 regulates the expression of multiple stem-regulatory genes and loss of MDA-9 causes a complete collapse of the stem-regulatory network in PCSCs. Loss of MDA-9 also sensitizes PCSCs to multiple chemotherapeutics with different modes of action, such as docetaxel and trichostatin-A, suggesting that MDA-9 may regulate multiple drug resistance. Mechanistically, MDA-9-mediated multiple drug resistance, stemness and survival are regulated in PCSCs through activation of STAT3.

The toxicity studies of N. alba extracts showed no inhibitory effect on wheat seed germination by evaluating the most sensitive physiological parameters (Germination %, Germination index, Vigor index) and using confocal laser scanning microscopy images. The analyzed extracts were found to have high antifungal activity against Candida glabrata with MIC values of 1.717 µg/mL for leaf and 1.935 µg/mL for root. The antitumor activity of the both extracts against A2780/A2780cisR ovarian, LNCaP prostate and MCF-7 breast cancer cells was promising with IC50 values ranging from 23-274 µg/mL for leaf and 18-152 µg/mL for root, and the combination of N. alba extracts with cisplatin showed a synergistic effect (coefficient of drug interaction <1). The antioxidant properties were assessed by β-carotene bleaching, ABTS and FRAP assays and cyclic voltammetry.

In this report, we tested the effectiveness of a dual CXCR4/E-selectin antagonist, GM-I1359, in vitro and in vivo, as a single agent or in combination with docetaxel (DTX). This agent was compared to the single CXCR4 antagonist, CTCE-9908, and E-selectin antagonist, GMI-1271. Here we demonstrate that CXCR4 antagonism reduced growth and enhanced DTX treatment in PCa cell lines as well as restored DTX effectiveness in DTX-resistant cell models. The efficacy of dual antagonist was higher respect to those observed for single CXCR4 antagonism. GM1359 impacted bone marrow colonization and growth in intraventricular and intratibial cell injection models. The anti-proliferative effects of GMI-1359 and DTX correlated with decreased size, osteolysis and serum levels of both mTRAP and type I collagen fragment (CTX) in intra-osseous tumours suggesting that the dual CXCR4/E-selectin antagonist was a docetaxel-sensitizing agent for bone metastatic growth. Single agent CXCR4 (CTCE-9908) and E-selectin (GMI-1271) antagonists resulted in lower sensitizing effects compared to GMI-1359. These data provide a biologic rationale for the use of a dual E-selectin/CXCR4 inhibitor as an adjuvant to taxane-based chemotherapy in men with mCRPC to prevent and reduce bone metastases.""","""['Claudio Festuccia', 'Andrea Mancini', 'Giovanni Luca Gravina', 'Alessandro Colapietro', 'Antonella Vetuschi', 'Simona Pompili', 'Luca Ventura', 'Simona Delle Monache', 'Roberto Iorio', 'Andrea Del Fattore', 'William Fogler', 'John Magnani']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Cells""","""['CXCR4 pharmacogical inhibition reduces bone and soft tissue metastatic burden by affecting tumor growth and tumorigenic potential in prostate cancer preclinical models.', 'Pigment epithelium-derived factor expression prolongs survival and enhances the cytotoxicity of low-dose chemotherapy in castration-refractory prostate cancer.', 'GLIPR1-ΔTM synergizes with docetaxel in cell death and suppresses resistance to docetaxel in prostate cancer cells.', 'Mifepristone Has Limited Activity to Enhance the In Vivo Efficacy of Docetaxel and Enzalutamide Against Bone Metastatic and Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Continuous versus intermittent docetaxel for metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer.', 'CXCL12-CXCR4/CXCR7 Axis in Cancer: from Mechanisms to Clinical Applications.', 'CXCR7 as a novel therapeutic target for advanced prostate cancer.', 'The prospect of tumor microenvironment-modulating therapeutical strategies.', 'Mechanisms of Cell Adhesion Molecules in Endocrine-Related Cancers: A Concise Outlook.', 'Epigenetic modification regulates tumor progression and metastasis through EMT (Review).']"""
