Patients and methods:   We collected malignant and matched non-malignant prostatectomy samples from men with adenocarcinoma involving two or more contiguous areas in only one lobe of the prostate. Tissue samples from both lobes were subjected to digestion and single-cell suspensions were prepared. Epithelial cell adhesion molecule-positive cells from cancerous and contralateral non-malignant (control) samples were isolated using magnetic beads, ensuring uniform populations were obtained for each donor. Unbiased RNA sequencing analysis was used to measure gene expression and for detection of transcribed mutations or splice variants that were over- or under-represented in malignant prostate epithelial cells relative to autologous control prostate epithelial cells.  Results:   From five patient samples we identified 17 genes that were altered in prostate cancer epithelial cells, with 82% of genes being downregulated. Three genes, TDRD1, ANGTL4, and CLDN3, were consistently upregulated in malignant tissue. Malignant cells from three of the five patients showed evidence of upregulated ERG signalling, however, only one of these contained a TMPRSS2-ERG rearrangement. We did not identify mutations, gene rearrangements, or splice variants that were consistent amongst the patients.  Conclusions:   Events occurring early in prostate cancer oncogenesis in these samples were characterized by a predominant downregulation of gene expression along with upregulation of TDRD1, ANGTL4 and CLDN3. No consistent mutations or splice variants were observed, but upregulation of ERG signalling was seen both in the presence and absence of the classic TMPRSS2-ERG rearrangement.""","""['Pavel Sluka', 'Carmel Pezaro', 'Hady Wardan', 'Shomik Sengupta', 'Ian D Davis']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""BJU Int""","""['Retention of Interstitial Genes between TMPRSS2 and ERG Is Associated with Low-Risk Prostate Cancer.', 'Nucleotide resolution analysis of TMPRSS2 and ERG rearrangements in prostate cancer.', 'Significance of the TMPRSS2:ERG gene fusion in prostate cancer.', 'Single-cell analysis of human primary prostate cancer reveals the heterogeneity of tumor-associated epithelial cell states.', 'TMPRSS2:ERG Gene Fusions in Prostate Cancer of West African Men and a Meta-Analysis of Racial Differences.', 'Prostate cancer grading, time to go back to the future.']"""

Methods:   Region of interest was extracted from DWI (peripheral zone) and T2W MRI (transitional zone and anterior fibromuscular stroma) around the center of 112 PCa lesions from 99 patients. Image histogram and texture features, 38 in total, were used together with a k-nearest neighbor classifier to classify lesions into their respective prognostic Grade Group (GG) (proposed by the International Society of Urological Pathology 2014 consensus conference). A semi-exhaustive feature search was performed (1-6 features in each feature set) and validated using threefold stratified cross validation in a one-versus-rest classification setup.  Results:   Classifying PCa lesions into GGs resulted in AUC of 0.87, 0.88, 0.96, 0.98, and 0.91 for GG1, GG2, GG1 + 2, GG3, and GG4 + 5 for the peripheral zone, respectively.

However, biochemical recurrence is observed in approximately 20% of cases, even with negative surgical margins, and some cases require salvage therapy. The elevated expression of low-molecular-weight protein tyrosine phosphatase (LMW-PTP, MW 18 kDa) is associated with a poor prognosis of certain cancers. In this study, we investigated whether the LMW-PTP expression levels could be used as a biomarker of recurrence in prostate cancer with negative surgical margins.  Materials and methods:   The subjects of this retrospective study were 119 patients who underwent total prostatectomy with negative resection margins. LMW-PTP expression was categorized either as a high-expression group or as a low-expression group bye two pathologists. Subsequently, we examined the relationship between LMW-PTP expression levels and clinicopathological factors including biochemical recurrence.  Results:   Evaluation of the immunostained samples by two pathologists was highly reliable, with an Intraclass correlation (ICC) score for two distinct measurements of 0.77 and 0.98, respectively. Seventy-three patients (61.3%) were placed in the LMW-PTP high expression group; and 46 patients (38.7%) were placed in the low expression group. The log-rank test revealed early biochemical recurrence in the high LMW-PTP expression group (p=0.0001). In addition, pathological T stage (p=0.004), lymphatic invasion (p=0.0456), Ki-67 labeling index (p=0.0002), and biochemical recurrence (p<0.0001) were more frequently identified in the LMW-PTP high expression group. Furthermore, multivariate analyses revealed that a high LMW-PTP expression level was an independent prognostic factor for biochemical recurrence (HR=3.14, 95% CI=1.37-8.07, p=0.0057). In addition, Ki-67 labeling indices were significantly higher in the high-expression group compared to the low-expression group (p<0.0001).  Conclusion:   LMW-PTP can be assessed using a single immunostaining protocol in a highly reproducible fashion. Tt may, thus, be applied clinically to establish the required postoperative follow-up period and determine the necessity for salvage therapy in cases of prostate cancer with negative surgical margins. LMW-PTP has the potential to be a highly useful prognostic biomarker and a therapeutic target in conjunction with other factors, such as the Gleason Score, the pathological T stage and the PSA level.""","""['Hirofumi Kurose', 'Kosuke Ueda', 'Reiichiro Kondo', 'Sachiko Ogasawara', 'Hironori Kusano', 'Sakiko Sanada', 'Yoshiki Naito', 'Jun Akiba', 'Tatsuyuki Kakuma', 'Tsukasa Igawa', 'Hirohisa Yano']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Anticancer Res""","""['Elevated Expression of EPHA2 Is Associated With Poor Prognosis After Radical Prostatectomy in Prostate Cancer.', 'Impact of positive surgical margins on prostate-specific antigen failure after radical prostatectomy in adjuvant treatment-naïve patients.', 'The Role of Prostate-specific Antigen Persistence After Radical Prostatectomy for the Prediction of Clinical Progression and Cancer-specific Mortality in Node-positive Prostate Cancer Patients.', 'Use of androgen deprivation and salvage radiation therapy for patients with prostate cancer and biochemical recurrence after prostatectomy.', 'Organ-limited prostate cancer with positive resection margins.

During tumour development, all sFRP (1, 2, 3, 4, and 5) genes are hypermethylated, causing transcriptional silencing. sFRPs have an ability to sensitize tumour cells to chemotherapeutic drugs, enhancing cell death. Reduced Wnt signalling is associated with loss of cancer stem cell (CSC) viability. We investigated the possible involvement of methylation-mediated silencing of the sFRP gene family in CSCs derived from breast, prostate, and ovarian tumour cell lines. Real-time RT-PCR studies indicated that loss or downregulation of sFRP (1-5) expression in tumours is associated with promoter hypermethylation. Additionally, CSCs derived from all tumour cell lines with sFRP (1-5) promotor hypermethylation expressed sFRP (1-5) mRNA after treatment with 5-Azacytidine (5-Aza), especially sFRP4, implying that DNA methylation is the predominant epigenetic mechanism for sFRP (1-5) silencing. Furthermore, post-translational modification (PTM) in total and histone proteins was observed post 5-Aza and sFRP4 treatment. Protein levels of Wnt downstream signalling components (GSK3β, active β-catenin, and phospho β-catenin) and epigenetic factors of histones (acetyl histone H3, and H3K27me3) affecting PTM were analysed. Our findings suggest that downregulation of sFRP4 expression in endocrine-related cancers can be attributed to aberrant promoter hypermethylation in conjugation with histone modification, and indicate the important role of methylation-induced gene silencing of sFRP4 in survival and proliferation of CSCs derived from these cancers.""","""['Abhijeet Deshmukh', 'Frank Arfuso', 'Philip Newsholme', 'Arun Dharmarajan']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Int J Biochem Cell Biol""","""['Change in gene expression profiles of secreted frizzled-related proteins (SFRPs) by sodium butyrate in gastric cancers: induction of promoter demethylation and histone modification causing inhibition of Wnt signaling.', 'SFRP1 repression in prostate cancer is triggered by two different epigenetic mechanisms.', 'Secreted Frizzled-related protein 4 (sFRP4) chemo-sensitizes cancer stem cells derived from human breast, prostate, and ovary tumor cell lines.', 'Secreted frizzled related proteins: Implications in cancers.', 'SFRP, a family of new colorectal tumor suppressor candidate genes.', 'Effect of Secreted Frizzled-Related Protein 5 in Mice with Heart Failure.', 'Mitochondria Dysfunction-Mediated Molecular Subtypes and Gene Prognostic Index for Prostate Cancer Patients Undergoing Radical Prostatectomy or Radiotherapy.', 'Unconventional protein post-translational modifications: the helmsmen in breast cancer.', 'A molecular insight of inflammatory cascades in rheumatoid arthritis and anti-arthritic potential of phytoconstituents.', 'Effects of YAP1 and SFRP2 overexpression on the biological behavior of colorectal cancer cells and their molecular mechanisms.']"""

By contrast, nothing is known on the in vivo proangiogenic effect of these dechlorinated derivatives. Based on in vitro data, the aims of this study were therefore to evaluate the in vivo influence of CLD and three of its dechlorinated metabolites in the control of neovascularization in a mice model of prostate cancer. The proangiogenic effect of CLD and three of its dechlorinated derivatives, CLD-1Cl, CLD-3Cl, and CLD-4Cl, was evaluated on a murine model of human prostate tumor (PC-3) treated, at two exposure levels: 33 μg/kg and 1.7 μg/kg respectively reflecting acute and chronic toxic exposure in human. The results of serum measurements show that, for the same ingested dose, the three metabolite concentrations were significantly lower than that of CLD. Dechlorination of CLD lead therefore to molecules that are biologically absorbed or metabolized, or both, faster than the parent molecule. Prostate tumor growth was lower in the groups treated by the three metabolites compared to the one treated by CLD. The vascularization measured on the tumor sections was inversely proportional to the rate of dechlorination, the treatment with CLD-4Cl showing no difference with control animals treated with only the vehicle oil used for all substances tested. We can therefore conclude that the proangiogenic effect of CLD is significantly decreased following the ISCR-resulting dechlorination. Further investigations are needed to elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which dechlorination of CLD reduces proangiogenic effects in prostate tumor.""","""['Eid Alabed Alibrahim', 'Samuel Legeay', 'Pierre-André Billat', 'Emmanuelle Bichon', 'Ingrid Guiffard', 'Jean-Philippe Antignac', 'Pierre Legras', 'Jérôme Roux', 'Sébastien Bristeau', 'Nicolas Clere', 'Sébastien Faure', 'Christophe Mouvet']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Environ Sci Pollut Res Int""","""['Two dechlorinated chlordecone derivatives formed by in situ chemical reduction are devoid of genotoxicity and mutagenicity and have lower proangiogenic properties compared to the parent compound.', 'Physico-chemical and agronomic results of soil remediation by In Situ Chemical Reduction applied to a chlordecone-contaminated nitisol at plot scale in a French Caribbean banana plantation.', 'Microbial Transformation of Chlordecone and Two Transformation Products Formed During in situ Chemical Reduction.', 'Transport of chlordecone and two of its derivatives through a saturated nitisol column (Martinique, France).', 'Microbial reductive dechlorination of PCBs.', 'Prostate cancer management: long-term beliefs, epidemic developments in the early twenty-first century and 3PM dimensional solutions.']"""

While immunotherapies were successfully tested in small-cell lung cancer, and programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression arises as an essential predictive biomarker, the local immune status in NEPCA is still poorly described.  Patients and methods:   Paraffin-embedded tissue samples of 39 patients (7 adenocarcinomas with neuroendocrine differentiation [ACA NED], 20 small-cell neuroendocrine carcinomas, 2 well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumors of NEPCA, and 10 adenocarcinoma liver metastases) were examined retrospectively by immunohistochemistry of chromogranin A (CGA), CD56, synaptophysin (SYN), CD3, and PD-L1. Laser capture microdissection was used for neuroendocrine hot-spot evaluation for additional real-time reverse transcription-quantitative PCR analysis (PD-L1, CGA, CD56, SYN, GRP, ASCL1, and DLK1).  Results:   PD-L1 immunohistochemistry expression in NEPCA was observed by assay E1L3N in 5 (20.8%) of 24 samples, but not by assay 22c3. Gene expression of PD-L1 could be evaluated in 18 (62%) of 29 samples. Nine (69%) of 13 prostate specimens and 2 (40%) of 5 liver metastases were positive for PD-L1. In ACA NED 4 (80%) of 5 and in small-cell neuroendocrine carcinomas 6 (50%) of 12 specimens were positive for PD-L1. Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes ≥ 10% were observed in 9 (37.5%) of 24 specimens. Low ASCL1 expression was observed in liver metastases.  Conclusion:   These data identify molecular PD-L1 features in NEPCA.

Cell viability was determined by CCK-8 assay. The cell migration and apoptosis were evaluated by wound healing assay and TUNEL staining method respectively. The expressions of ER-related proteins were analyzed by western blot and the CHOP siRNA was used to downregulate the CHOP expression.  Key findings:   The results demonstrated that treatment of A549 and 95-D cells with honokiol significantly reduced cell viability in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Furthermore, honokiol treatment decreased cell migration and enhanced cell apoptosis, which is accompanied by the upregulation of the expressions of ER stress-induced apoptotic signaling molecules such as GRP78, phosphorylated PERK, phosphorylated eIF2α, CHOP, Bcl-2, Bax, and cleaved Caspase 9. Honokiol treatment-induced increase of ER stress-related signaling molecules and apoptotic proteins in A549 and 95-D cells were reversed by CHOP siRNA.

The objective of the current national cohort study was to analyze the correlation between choice and competition on outcomes after cancer surgery using prostate cancer as a case study.  Methods:   The analyses included all men who underwent prostate cancer surgery in the United Kingdom between 2008 and 2011 (n = 12,925). Multilevel logistic regression was used to assess the effect of a radical prostatectomy center being located in a competitive environment (based on the number of centers within a threshold distance) and being a successful competitor (based on the ability to attract patients from other hospitals) on 3 patient-level outcomes: postoperative length of hospital stay >3 days, 30-day emergency readmissions, and 2-year urinary complications.  Results:   With adjustment for patient characteristics, men who underwent surgery in centers located in a stronger competitive environment were less likely to have a 30-day emergency readmission, irrespective of the type or volume of procedures performed at each center (odds ratio, 0.46; 95% confidence interval, 0.36-0.60; P = .005). Men who received treatment at centers that were successful competitors were less likely to have a length of hospital stay >3 days (odds ratio, 0.49; 95% confidence interval, 0.25-0.94; P = .02).  Conclusions:   The current results suggest for the first time that hospital competition improves short-term outcomes after prostate cancer surgery.

Furthermore, there may be heterogeneity in responses, and the optimal treatment for a patient will depend on his clinical and tumor characteristics.  Objectives:   To use a unified statistical approach to compare the association of surgery and radiotherapy with both metastatic clinical failure (CF) and survival in localized prostate cancer and to develop an online calculator for individualized, treatment-specific outcome prediction.  Design, setting, and participants:   Cohort study for statistical analysis and development of individualized predictions using Bayesian multistate models that jointly consider both CF and survival and adjust for confounding factors. This study used data from patients treated at the University of Michigan between January 1, 1996, and July 1, 2013, with detailed information on treatment, patient and tumor characteristics, and outcomes. Primary analyses were performed in 2017 and 2018. Participants were a cohort of 4544 patients with localized prostate cancer undergoing primary treatment.  Exposures:   Radical prostatectomy and external beam radiotherapy.  Main outcomes and measures:   The clinical outcomes were metastatic CF, death after CF, and death from other causes. The adjustment factors were age, prostate gland volume, prostate-specific antigen level, comorbidities, Gleason score, perineural invasion, cT category, race, and treatment year. An online calculator was developed to estimate risks for multiple outcomes for any patient based on 2 treatment choices and on his clinical and tumor characteristics.  Results:   Among 4544 men (mean [SD] age, 61.2 [8.0] years), 3769 underwent radical prostatectomy, 775 received external beam radiotherapy, 157 (3.5%) had CF, 90 (2.0%) died after CF, and 378 (8.3%) died of other causes. Across all patients, there was no significant difference in risk of CF for surgery vs radiotherapy (hazard ratio, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.52-1.23). However, using multistate models, in some cases individualized predictions resulted in different expected outcomes between surgery and radiotherapy for a given patient.  Conclusions and relevance:   In this study, after adjustment for measured confounders, the hazard of CF was similar between treatments on average. However, these data indicate a greater oncologic benefit for some individual patients if treated with surgery and for other patients if treated with radiotherapy. Individualized predictions provide a novel approach to facilitate treatment decision making.""","""['Lauren J Beesley', 'Todd M Morgan', 'Daniel E Spratt', 'Udit Singhal', 'Felix Y Feng', 'Allison Cullen Furgal', 'William C Jackson', 'Stephanie Daignault', 'Jeremy M G Taylor']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""JAMA Netw Open""","""['Radical Prostatectomy, External Beam Radiotherapy, or External Beam Radiotherapy With Brachytherapy Boost and Disease Progression and Mortality in Patients With Gleason Score 9-10 Prostate Cancer.', 'Surgery vs Radiotherapy in the Management of Biopsy Gleason Score 9-10 Prostate Cancer and the Risk of Mortality.', 'Association Between Radiation Therapy, Surgery, or Observation for Localized Prostate Cancer and Patient-Reported Outcomes After 3 Years.', 'Management of localised prostate cancer: watchful waiting, surgery or radiation therapy, depending on the natural course, which is often relatively slow.', 'Prostate-Specific Antigen-Based Screening for Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Evidence Review for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force Internet.', 'Comparing Individualized Survival Predictions From Random Survival Forests and Multistate Models in the Presence of Missing Data: A Case Study of Patients With Oropharyngeal Cancer.', 'Automated data extraction tool (DET) for external applications in radiotherapy.', 'Multistate models for the natural history of cancer progression.', 'Artificial Intelligence-Based Prognostic Model for Urologic Cancers: A SEER-Based Study.', 'High Keratin-7 Expression in Benign Peri-Tumoral Prostatic Glands Is Predictive of Bone Metastasis Onset and Prostate Cancer-Specific Mortality.']"""

Objective:   To assess the association of receipt of palliative care among patients with metastatic cancer with receipt of treatment at minority-serving hospitals (MSHs) vs non-MSHs.  Design, setting, and participants:   This retrospective cohort study used Participant Use Files of the National Cancer Database, a prospectively maintained, hospital-based cancer registry consisting of all patients treated at more than 1500 US hospitals, to collect data from individuals older than 40 years with metastatic prostate, lung, colon, and breast cancer, diagnosed from January 1, 2004, to December 31, 2015. Data were accessed in October 2017, and the analysis was performed in July 2018.  Exposures:   Hospitals in the top decile in terms of the proportion of black and Hispanic patients for each cancer type were defined as MSHs.  Main outcomes and measures:   A multilevel logistic regression model that estimated the odds of palliative care was fit, adjusting for year of diagnosis, sex, race/ethnicity, insurance, income, educational level, and cancer type, with an interaction term between cancer type and MSH status and a hospital-level random intercept to account for unmeasured hospital characteristics.  Results:   A total of 601 680 individuals (mean [SD] age, 67.4 [11.4] years; 95% CI, 67.2-67.6 years; 314 279 [52.2%] male; 475 039 [78.9%] white) were studied. In total, 130 813 patients (21.7%) received palliative care, ranging from 102 019 (25.4%) with lung cancer to 9966 (11.1%) with colon cancer. In total, 16 435 black individuals (20.0%) and 3551 Hispanic individuals (15.9%) received palliative care vs 106 603 non-Hispanic white individuals (22.5%) (P < .001). The MSH patients were less likely than the non-MSH patients to receive palliative care, regardless of race/ethnicity (12 692 [18.0%] vs 118 121 [22.3%]; P = .002). In an adjusted analysis, treatment at an MSH had a statistically significant association with lower odds of receiving palliative care (odds ratio, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.53-0.84).  Conclusions and relevance:   Although the factors associated with minority patients' receipt of palliative care are complex, in this study, treatment at MSHs was associated with significantly lower odds of receiving any palliative care in an adjusted analysis, but black and Hispanic race/ethnicity was not.

However, the therapeutic effect of MSKE on more aggressive androgen-independent prostate cancer remains unknown. This study examined the effects of MSKE treatment in metastatic prostate cancer using complementary PC-3 cells and xenograft model. MSKE significantly inhibited PC-3 human prostate cancer cell tumor growth in vitro and in vivo. The growth-inhibitory effect of MSKE appeared to be through the induction of cell-cycle arrest. This induction was accompanied by a reduction in the protein expression of Hsp40 and cell-cycle regulation proteins, cyclin D1 and NF-kBp65. In addition, MSKE induced p21 expression independent of wild-type p53 induced protein expression. Moreover, we demonstrate that MSKE significantly inhibited cell migration in PC-3 prostate cancer cells. Overall, these results demonstrate that MSKE inhibits prostate tumor growth and migration, and induces cell-cycle arrest by targeting Hsp40 and proteins involved in cell-cycle regulation and proliferation.

The use of DNA-damaging agents has a long history in cancer chemotherapy but is limited by their toxicities. The combination with a safer drug can be a strategy in reducing dosage and toxicity while increasing anticancer activity in CRPC treatment. Phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitors are used to treat erectile dysfunction through the selective inhibition of PDE5 that is responsible for cGMP degradation in the corpus cavernosum. Several studies have reported that PDE5 inhibitors display protective effect against doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity. The combinatory treatment of CRPC with doxorubicin and PDE5 inhibitors has been studied accordingly. The data demonstrated that sildenafil or vardenafil (two structure-related PDE5 inhibitors) but not tadalafil (structure-unrelated to sildenafil) sensitized doxorubicin-induced apoptosis in CRPC cells with deteriorating the down-regulation of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members, including Bcl-xL and Mcl-1, and amplifying caspase activation. Homologous recombination (HR) and non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) DNA repair systems were inhibited in the apoptotic sensitization through detection of nuclear foci formation of Rad51 and DNA end-binding of Ku80. PDE5 knockdown to mimic the exposure to PDE5 inhibitors did not reproduce apoptotic sensitization, suggesting a PDE5-independent mechanism. Not only doxorubicin, sildenafil combined with other inhibitors of topoisomerase II but not topoisomerase I also triggered apoptotic sensitization. In conclusion, the data suggest that sildenafil and vardenafil induce PDE5-independent apoptotic sensitization to doxorubicin (or other topoisomerase II inhibitors) through impairment of both HR and NHEJ repair systems that are evident by a decrease of nuclear Rad51 levels and their foci formation in the nucleus, and an inhibition of Ku80 DNA end-binding capability.

Using zinc-finger nuclease technology or PKCζ shRNA lentiviral particles, and orthotopic mouse xenografts, we show that PKCζ-knockout or knockdown from aggressive prostate cancer (PC3 and PC3U) cells, decreasesd tumor growth and lymphatic metastasis in vivo. Intriguingly, PKCζ-knockout or knockdown impaired the activation of AKT, ERK, and NF-κB signaling in prostate cancer cells, thereby impairing the expression of lymphangiogenic factors and macrophage recruitment, resulting in aberrant lymphangiogenesis. Moreover, PKCζ regulated the expression of hyaluronan synthase enzymes, which is important for hyaluronan-mediated lymphatic drainage and tumor dissemination.

We show that, as an example, we are able to accurately predict the dose of intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) for prostate cancer patients, where the average Dice similarity coefficient is 0.91 when comparing the predicted vs. true isodose volumes between 0% and 100% of the prescription dose. The average value of the absolute differences in [max, mean] dose is found to be under 5% of the prescription dose, specifically for each structure is [1.80%, 1.03%](PTV), [1.94%, 4.22%](Bladder), [1.80%, 0.48%](Body), [3.87%, 1.79%](L Femoral Head), [5.07%, 2.55%](R Femoral Head), and [1.26%, 1.62%](Rectum) of the prescription dose.

Patients and methods:   Within the PLCO (Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovary) trial, patients who were diagnosed with clinically localized prostate cancer and subsequently received treatment with prostatectomy or radiation therapy (with or without hormonal treatment) were included. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were then performed to determine factors affecting overall and prostate cancer-specific survival.

These included 2044 patients treated with prostatectomy and 1909 patients treated with radiation therapy with or without hormonal treatment. In an adjusted multivariate analysis for factors affecting overall survival, prostatectomy was associated with better overall survival compared with radiation therapy (hazard ratio, 0.548; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.440- 681; P < .001). Likewise, in an adjusted multivariate analysis for factors affecting prostate cancer-specific survival, prostatectomy was associated with better prostate cancer-specific survival compared with radiation therapy (hazard ratio, 0.485; 95% CI, 0.286- 0.822; P = .007).

This retrospective population-based cohort study was conducted using 2009⁻2013 data from the Longitudinal Health Insurance Database. This study enrolled patients who were diagnosed with a UTI between 2010 and 2012. A 1:2 propensity score-matched control population without UTI served as the control group. Multivariate analysis with a multiple Cox regression model was applied to analyze the data. A total of 38,084 patients with UTI were included in the study group, and 76,168 participants without UTI were included in the control group. The result showed a higher hazard ratio of any cancer in both sexes with UTI (for males, adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) = 1.32; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.12⁻1.54; for females, aHR = 1.21; 95% CI = 1.08⁻1.35). Patients with UTI had a higher probability of developing new GUC than those without UTI. Moreover, the genital organs, kidney, and urinary bladder of men were significantly more affected than those of women with prior UTI. Furthermore, antibiotic treatment for more than 7 days associated the incidence of bladder cancer in men (7⁻13 days, aHR = 1.23, 95% CI = 0.50⁻3.02; >14 days, aHR = 2.73, CI = 1.32⁻5.64). In conclusion, UTI is significantly related to GUC and may serve as an early sign of GUC, especially in the male genital organs, prostate, kidney, and urinary bladder. During UTI treatment, physicians should cautiously prescribe antibiotics to patients.""","""['Chia-Hung Huang', 'Ying-Hsiang Chou', 'Han-Wei Yeh', 'Jing-Yang Huang', 'Shun-Fa Yang', 'Chao-Bin Yeh']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Int J Environ Res Public Health""","""['Association between vesicoureteral reflux, urinary tract infection and antibiotics exposure in infancy and risk of childhood asthma.', 'Urinary tract infection increases subsequent urinary tract cancer risk: a population-based cohort study.', 'Antibiotic management of urinary tract infection in elderly patients in primary care and its association with bloodstream infections and all cause mortality: population based cohort study.', 'Rational antibiotic therapy of urinary tract infections.', ""Urinary Tract Infection in Parkinson's Disease."", 'Association between trichomoniasis and prostate and bladder diseases: a population-based case-control study.', 'Association between chronic bladder catheterisation and bladder cancer incidence and mortality: a population-based retrospective cohort study in Ontario, Canada.', 'Risk of Mortality and Readmission among Patients with Pelvic Fracture and Urinary Tract Infection: A Population-Based Cohort Study.', 'Prostate cancer management: long-term beliefs, epidemic developments in the early twenty-first century and 3PM dimensional solutions.']"""

Steroid reductases 5α (SRD5As) are key enzymes in androgen biosynthesis. Mutations in the human SRD5A2 are known to cause loss-of-function and severe 46,XY undervirilization. Gain-of-function variants have been suggested in androgen excess syndromes, but have not been found so far. Therefore we searched for gain-of-function mutations in the human SRD5A2 gene which might explain hyperandrogenic disorders such as the polycystic ovary syndrome, premature adrenarche and prostate cancer. We screened databases for candidate variants and characterised them in silico with the help of a novel SRD5A2 model. We selected 9 coding SNPs (A49T, R50A, P106L, P106A, N122A, L167S, R168C, P173S, R227Q) that have not been described in manifesting individuals, and assessed their enzyme kinetic properties in HEK293 cells. SRD5A2 activity was assessed by conversion of testosterone (T), progesterone (Prog) and androstenedione (Δ4A) to their 5α-reduced metabolites. Variants R50A and P173S showed partial activity with substrates T (34% and 28%) and Δ4A (37% and 22%). With substrate Prog variants P106L, P106A, L167S and R168C in addition showed partial activity (15% to 64%). Functional testing of all other variants showed loss-of-function. As predicted in our in silico analysis, all coding SNPs affected enzyme activity, however none of them showed gain-of-function. Thus excess 5α-reductase activity might be rather regulated at the (post)-transcriptional and/or post-translational level. However through this work seven new coding SNPs were characterised which might be of clinical relevance. It is possible that individuals carrying these SNPs show a minor phenotype that is not yet identified.""","""['Efstathios Katharopoulos', 'Kay Sauter', 'Amit V Pandey', 'Christa E Flück']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""J Steroid Biochem Mol Biol""","""['Novel mutations of the SRD5A2 and AR genes in Thai patients with 46, XY disorders of sex development.', 'Mutational analysis of SRD5A2: From gene to functional kinetics in individuals with steroid 5α-reductase 2 deficiency.', 'Molecular diagnosis of 5α-reductase type II deficiency in Brazilian siblings with 46,XY disorder of sex development.', 'The Molecular Basis of 5α-Reductase Type 2 Deficiency.', 'Practical approach to steroid 5alpha-reductase type 2 deficiency.', 'Effects on Steroid 5-Alpha Reductase Gene Expression of Thai Rice Bran Extracts and Molecular Dynamics Study on SRD5A2.', 'Integrative and Analytical Review of the 5-Alpha-Reductase Type 2 Deficiency Worldwide.']"""

We sought to determine whether miR-182, an miRNA with reported oncogenic functions in the prostate, is associated with biochemical recurrence and aggressive disease. Prostate epithelial miR-182 expression was quantified via in situ hybridization of two prostate tissue microarrays and by laser-capture microdissection of prostate epithelium. miR-182 was significantly higher in cancer epithelium than adjacent benign epithelium (P < 0.0001). The ratio of cancer to benign miR-182 expression per patient was inversely associated with recurrence in a multivariate logistic regression model (odds ratio = 0.18; 95% CI, 0.03-0.89; P = 0.044). Correlation of miR-182 with mRNA expression in laser-capture microdissected benign prostate epithelium was used to predict prostatic miR-182 targets. Genes that were negatively correlated with miR-182 were enriched for its predicted targets and for genes previously identified as up-regulated in prostate cancer metastases. miR-182 expression was also negatively correlated with genes previously identified as up-regulated in primary prostate tumors from African American patients, who are at an increased risk of developing aggressive prostate cancer. Taken together, these results suggest that although miR-182 is expressed at higher levels in localized prostate cancer, its levels are lower in aggressive cancers, suggesting a biphasic role for this miRNA that may be exploited for prognostic and/or therapeutic purposes to reduce prostate cancer progression.""","""['Bethany Baumann', 'Andrés M Acosta', 'Zachary Richards', 'Ryan Deaton', 'Anastasiya Sapatynska', 'Adam Murphy', 'Andre Kajdacsy-Balla', 'Peter H Gann', 'Larisa Nonn']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Am J Pathol""","""['Elevated miR-615-3p Expression Predicts Adverse Clinical Outcome and Promotes Proliferation and Migration of Prostate Cancer Cells.', 'Tumor suppressor microRNAs, miR-100 and -125b, are regulated by 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D in primary prostate cells and in patient tissue.', 'Cell-type specific expression of oncogenic and tumor suppressive microRNAs in the human prostate and prostate cancer.', 'Role of microRNAs in the development, prognosis and therapeutic response of patients with prostate cancer.', 'Experimental challenges to modeling prostate cancer heterogeneity.', 'Small Non-Coding RNAs in Human Cancer.', 'The Potential of MicroRNAs as Non-Invasive Prostate Cancer Biomarkers: A Systematic Literature Review Based on a Machine Learning Approach.', 'MiR-223-3p attenuates the migration and invasion of NSCLC cells by regulating NLRP3.', 'Hsa-miR-181a-5p, hsa-miR-182-5p, and hsa-miR-26a-5p as potential biomarkers for BCR-ABL1 among adult chronic myeloid leukemia treated with tyrosine kinase inhibitors at the molecular response.', 'microRNA-based diagnostic and therapeutic applications in cancer medicine.']"""

Objective:   To assess the benefit of ADT plus docetaxel in patients presenting with rising prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels after primary local therapy and high-risk factors but no evidence of metastatic disease.  Design, setting, and participants:   This open-label, phase 3, randomized superiority trial comparing ADT plus docetaxel vs ADT alone enrolled patients from 28 centers in France between June 4, 2003, and September 25, 2007; final follow-up was conducted April 12, 2017, and analysis was performed May 2 to July 31, 2017. Patients had undergone primary local therapy for prostate cancer, were experiencing rising PSA levels, and were considered to be at high risk of metastatic disease. Stratification was by prior local therapy and PSA-level doubling time (≤6 vs >6 months), and intention-to-treat analysis was used.  Interventions:   Patients were randomly assigned to receive ADT (1 year) plus docetaxel, 70 mg/m2 (every 3 weeks [6 cycles]), or ADT alone (1 year).  Main outcomes and measures:   The primary outcome was PSA progression-free survival (PSA-PFS). Secondary end points were PSA response, radiologic PFS, overall survival, safety, and quality of life.  Results:   Overall, 254 patients were randomized (1:1) to the trial; median age, 64 years in the ADT plus docetaxel arm, 66 years in the ADT alone arm. At a median follow-up of 30.0 months, the median PSA-PFS was 20.3 (95% CI, 19.0-21.6) months in the ADT plus docetaxel arm vs 19.3 (95% CI, 18.2-20.8) months in the ADT alone arm (hazard ratio [HR], 0.85; 95% CI, 0.62-1.16; P = .31). At a median follow-up of 10.5 years, there was no significant between-arm difference in radiologic PFS (HR, 1.03; 95% CI, 0.74-1.43; P = .88). Overall survival data were not mature. The most common grade 3 or 4 hematologic toxic effects in the ADT plus docetaxel arm were neutropenia (60 of 125 patients [48.0%]), febrile neutropenia (10 [8.0%]), and thrombocytopenia (4 [3.0%]). There was no significant between-arm difference in overall quality of life.  Conclusions and relevance:   Compared with ADT alone, combined ADT plus docetaxel therapy with curative intent did not significantly improve PSA-PFS in patients with high-risk prostate cancer and rising PSA levels and no evidence of metastatic disease.

However, the segmentation task is challenging due to inhomogeneous intensity distributions, variation in prostate anatomy, among other problems. Manual segmentation can be time-consuming and is subject to inter- and intraobserver variation. We developed an automated deep learning-based method to address this technical challenge.  Methods:   We propose a three-dimensional (3D) fully convolutional networks (FCN) with deep supervision and group dilated convolution to segment the prostate on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In this method, a deeply supervised mechanism was introduced into a 3D FCN to effectively alleviate the common exploding or vanishing gradients problems in training deep models, which forces the update process of the hidden layer filters to favor highly discriminative features. A group dilated convolution which aggregates multiscale contextual information for dense prediction was proposed to enlarge the effective receptive field of convolutional neural networks, which improve the prediction accuracy of prostate boundary. In addition, we introduced a combined loss function including cosine and cross entropy, which measures similarity and dissimilarity between segmented and manual contours, to further improve the segmentation accuracy. Prostate volumes manually segmented by experienced physicians were used as a gold standard against which our segmentation accuracy was measured.  Results:   The proposed method was evaluated on an internal dataset comprising 40 T2-weighted prostate MR volumes. Our method achieved a Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) of 0.86 ± 0.04, a mean surface distance (MSD) of 1.79 ± 0.46 mm, 95% Hausdorff distance (95%HD) of 7.98 ± 2.91 mm, and absolute relative volume difference (aRVD) of 15.65 ± 10.82. A public dataset (PROMISE12) including 50 T2-weighted prostate MR volumes was also employed to evaluate our approach. Our method yielded a DSC of 0.88 ± 0.05, MSD of 1.02 ± 0.35 mm, 95% HD of 9.50 ± 5.11 mm, and aRVD of 8.93 ± 7.56.  Conclusion:   We developed a novel deeply supervised deep learning-based approach with a group dilated convolution to automatically segment the MRI prostate, demonstrated its clinical feasibility, and validated its accuracy against manual segmentation.

Therefore, a systematic method for construction of PRO questionnaires including selection of the appropriate questions is needed. Purpose: The purpose of the present study was to develop and test a method of item selection for a PRO questionnaire to monitor adverse events in oncologic routine treatment of metastatic prostate cancer patients. Patient and methods: Documentation on common symptomatic adverse events for the three drugs was collected from five different sources: 1) FDA product summary information; 2) EMA product summary information; 3) phase 3 Randomized Controlled Trials (RCT) leading to drug approval; 4) audit of the electronic patient files focusing on the oncologist's documentation of adverse events and 5) individual patient interview (n = 16) focusing on adverse events. The Patient Reported Outcome of Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (PRO-CTCAE) was used as PRO item library. Selected symptoms were transformed into corresponding PRO-CTCAE questions. The questionnaire was tested by patients in a pilot test (n = 12). Patients for interviews and pilot testing were included by purposive sampling. Results: A method for constructing a PRO questionnaire was developed, and a questionnaire of 25 PRO-CTCAE symptoms with 46 questions including an open write-in space for additional adverse events was constructed and tested. Conclusion: This study demonstrates a systematic method to select questions on adverse events for a PRO questionnaire in a specific cancer population receiving oncologic treatment. The present study reveals that audit of patient files and patient interviews in our setting only add little to the information on adverse events obtained from FDA, EMA and RCT.

Purpose:   To evaluate modeling of quantitative apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), texture, and shape features using logistic regression (LR) and support vector machine (SVM) models for the diagnosis of transition zone PCa.  Study type:   Retrospective.  Population:   Ninety patients; 44 consecutive TZ PCa were compared with 61 consecutive BPH nodules (26 glandular/35 stromal).  Field strength/sequence:   3 T/T2 -weighted (T2 W) fast spin-echo, diffusion weighted imaging.  Assessment:   A radiologist manually segmented lesions on axial images for quantitative ADC (mean, 10th , 25th -centile-ADC), T2 W-shape (circularity, convexity) and T2 W-texture (kurtosis, skewness, entropy, run-length nonuniformity [RLNU], gray-level nonuniformity [GLNU]) analysis. A second radiologist segmented one-fifth of randomly selected lesions to determine the reproducibility of measurements. The reference standard was histopathology for all lesions.  Statistical tests:   Quantitative features were selected a priori and were compared using univariate and multivariate analysis. LR and SVM models of statistically significant features were constructed and evaluated using receiver operator characteristic (ROC) analysis. Subgroup analysis of TZ PCa vs. only stromal BPH and in lesions measuring <15 mm was performed. Agreement in measurements was assessed using the Dice similarity coefficient (DSC).  Results:   Mean, 25th and 10th -centile ADC, circularity, and texture (entropy, RLNU, GLNU) features differed between groups (P < 0.0001-0.0058); however, at multivariate analysis only circularity and ADC metrics (P < 0.001) remained significant. LR and SVM models were highly accurate for the diagnosis of TZ PCa (sensitivity/specificity/AUC): 93.2%/98.4%/0.989 and 93.2%/96.7%/0.949, respectively, with no significance difference between the LR and SVM models (P = 0.2271). Reproducibility of segmentation was excellent (DSC 0.84 tumors and 0.87 BPH). Subgroup analyses of TZ PCa vs. stromal BPH (AUC = 0.976) and in <15 mm lesions (AUC = 0.990) remained highly accurate.  Data conclusion:   LR and SVM models incorporating previously described quantitative ADC, shape and texture analysis features are highly accurate for the diagnosis of TZ PCa and remained accurate when comparing TZ PCa with stromal BPH and in smaller lesions.

Methods:   Data from the Shared Equal Access Regional Cancer Hospital (SEARCH) cohort were used to study the associations between weight change approximately 1-year post-ADT initiation and metastases, castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), all-cause mortality (ACM), and PC-specific mortality (PCSM) in 357 patients who had undergone RP between 1988 and 2014. We estimated hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) using covariate-adjusted Cox regression models for associations between weight loss, and weight gains of 2.3 kg or more, and PC progression and mortality post-ADT.  Results:   During a median (IQR) follow-up of 81 (46-119) months, 55 men were diagnosed with metastases, 61 with CRPC, 36 died of PC, and 122 died of any cause. In multivariable analysis, weight loss was associated with increases in risks of metastases (HR 3.13; 95% CI 1.40-6.97), PCSM (HR 4.73; 95% CI 1.59-14.0), and ACM (HR 2.16; 95% CI 1.25-3.74) compared with mild weight gains of ≤ 2.2.

The role of FABP5 gene expression is merely unknown.  Methods:   In two cohorts of PCa patients who underwent radical prostatectomy (n = 40 and n = 57) and one cohort of patients treated with palliative transurethral resection of the prostate (pTUR-P; n = 50) FABP5 mRNA expression was analyzed with qRT-PCR. Expression was correlated with clinical parameters. BPH tissue samples served as control. To independently validate findings on FABP5 expression, three microarray and sequencing datasets were reanalyzed (MSKCC 2010 n = 216; TCGA 2015 n = 333; mCRPC, Nature Medicine 2016 n = 114). FABP5 expression was correlated with ERG-fusion status, TCGA subtypes, cancer driver mutations and the expression of druggable downstream pathway components.  Results:   FABP5 was overexpressed in PCa compared to BPH in the cohorts analyzed by qRT-PCR (radical prostatectomy p = 0.003, p = 0.010; pTUR-P p = 0.002). FABP5 expression was independent of T stage, Gleason Score, nodal status and PSA level. FABP5 overexpression was associated with the absence of TMPRSS2:ERG fusion (p < 0.001 in TCGA and MSKCC). Correlation with TCGA subtypes revealed FABP5 overexpression to be associated with SPOP and FOXA1 mutations. FABP5 was positively correlated with potential drug targets located downstream of FABP5 in the PPAR-signaling pathway.  Conclusion:   FABP5 overexpression is frequent in PCa, but seems to be restricted to TMPRESS2:ERG fusion-negative tumors and is associated with SPOP and FOXA1 mutations.

Materials and methods:   The clinical parameters of 106 mCRPC patients treated with abiraterone were retrospectively evaluated. Patients were either oligometastatic (≤5 metastases) at diagnosis or became oligometastatic after the systemic treatment was analyzed. Local RT to the primary tumor and pelvic lymphatics was delivered in 44 patients (41%), and 62 patients (59%) did not have RT to the primary tumor. After propensity match analysis, a total of 92 patients were analyzed.  Resultsn:   Median follow-up time was 14.2 months (range: 2.3-54.9 months). Median overall survival (OS) was higher in patients treated with local RT to the primary tumor than in those treated without local RT with borderline significance (24.1 vs. 21.4 months; p = 0.08). Local RT to the prostate and pelvic lymphatics significantly diminished the local recurrence rate (16 patients, 31% vs. 2 patients, 5%; p = 0.003). In multivariate analysis, the prostate specific antigen (PSA) response ≥50% of the baseline obtained 3 weeks after abiraterone therapy was the only significant prognostic factor for better OS and progression-free survival (PFS).

Methods:   Weekly blood test results were extracted from the charts of patients treated within a phase III study comparing HYPO to CF. In order to compare WBC counts at the same nominal dose in both arms and thus to tease out the effect of fractionation, for each recorded WBC value the corresponding cumulative total dose was extracted as well. WBC counts were binned according to percentiles of the delivered dose and three dose levels were identified at median doses of 16, 34.1 and 52 Gy, respectively. A General Linear Model based on mixed design Analysis Of Variance (ANOVA) was used to test variation of WBC counts between the two treatment arms.  Results:   Out of 168 randomized patients, 140 (83.3%) had at least one observation for each one of the selected dose levels and were included in the analysis. Mean counts were lower in the CF than the HYPO arm at all selected dose levels, reaching a statistically significant difference at dose level #3 (5397/mm3 vs 6038/mm3 for CF and HYPO, respectively, p = 0.004). The GLM model confirms that the impact of dose on WBC counts is significantly lower in the HYPO arm over the CF one (Greenhouse-Geisser test, p = 0.04). Interestingly, while WBC counts tend to drop throughout all dose levels in the CF arm, this is the case only in the earlier part of treatment in the HYPO arm.

Material and methods: This is a cohort study among participants in the Danish prospective Diet, Cancer and Health (DCH) study including 2337 men diagnosed with prostate cancer between 1997 and 2014. Primary outcome was indication of moderate to severe depression, defined as either a first hospital contact for depression or first use of antidepressants. The main indicator of socioeconomic position was education categorized into short (<9 years of education), medium (9-12 years) and long (>12 years). We retrieved information on education, depression and cohabitation status from Danish National Registries. Information on stage, primary treatment, lifestyle and anthropometry was obtained from medical records and questionnaires. Data were analyzed using Cox proportional hazards models adjusted for possible confounders and mediators. Results: The hazard of first depression was 1.86-fold higher (95% CI, 1.36-2.54) in prostate cancer patients with short education compared to those with long education. Adjustment for stage and primary treatment did not change the HRs, while adding comorbidity and lifestyle factors resulted in an HR of 1.65 (95% CI, 1.19-2.29). Men with medium education had a non-statistically significant 1.23-fold higher hazard of depression (95% CI, 0.95-1.59) than men with long education in the fully adjusted model. Educational differences were present in the cumulative incidence of first depression among cancer-free DCH study participants, but the level of first depression was substantially lower in this population than in prostate cancer patients.

Our purpose is to test the hypothesis that p2PSA (Index test) detects prostate cancer relapse (BCR) earlier than the current Reference Standard Test (total prostate-specific antigen [tPSA]) in patients who underwent RP for localized PCa.  Methods:   This is an observational, prospective, cohort, follow-up study in patients subjected to RALP (robotic assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy) for clinically localized PCa from January 2013 to July 2013 at a high-volume Institution (450 average RP/year). A blood sample, for tPSA and p2PSA, was prospectively drawn after 3, 6, and 12 months and then every 6 months during the following two years. The primary outcome is to determine whether or not kinetics in rising of p2PSA significantly anticipates the tPSA kinetics. Exploratory data analysis was used to identify relationship between different variables.  Results:   Over 134 patients 20 BCRs were detected according to tPSA cut-off. Five patients showed a contemporary increase of tPSA and p2PSA, 11 presented a p2PSA increase earlier than tPSA increase (13.9 months ±9.7). In four patients, the increase of PSA was not associated with a p2PSA>0.8 pg/mL. The correlation between tPSA and p2PSA according to Sperman's rho coefficient was statistically significant at 3, 6, 18 and 30 months: 0.416 (P<0.01), 0.255 (P<0.01), 0.359 (P<0.01) and 0.413 (P<0.01) respectively. When subjects were stratified according to stage/grade and margins (positive vs. negative), patients with higher stage and positive surgical margins could be considered the target categories.

Lately, histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) such as suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA, or vorinostat, MK0683) have been emerging as a new class of drugs with promising therapeutic benefits in controlling cancer growth and metastasis. The small molecule RG7388 (idasanutlin, R05503781) is a newly developed inhibitor that is specific for an oncogene-derived protein called MDM2, which is also in clinical trials for the treatment of various types of cancers. These two drugs have shown the ability to induce p21 expression through distinct mechanisms in MCF-7 and LNCaP cells, which are reported to have wild-type TP53. Our understanding of the molecular mechanism whereby SAHA and RG7388 can induce cell cycle arrest and trigger cell death is still evolving. In this study, we performed experiments to measure the cell cycle arrest effects of SAHA and RG7388 using MCF-7 and LNCaP cells.  Materials and methods:   The cytotoxicity, cell cycle arrest, and apoptosis/necroptosis effects of the SAHA and RG7388 treatments were assessed using the Trypan Blue dye exclusion (TBDE) method, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay, fluorescence assay with DEVD-amc substrate, and immunoblotting methods.  Results:   The RG7388 treatment was able to induce cell death by elevating p21WAF1/CIP1 through inhibition of MDM2 in LNCaP, but not in MCF-7 cells, even though there was evidence of p53 elevation. Hence, we suspect that there is some level of uncoupling of p53-mediated transcriptional induction of p21WAF1/CIP1 in MCF-7 cells.  Conclusion:   Our results from MCF-7 and LNCaP cells confirmed that SAHA and RG7388 treatments were able to induce cell death via a combination of cell cycle arrest and cytotoxic mechanisms. We speculate that our findings could lead to the development of newer treatments for breast and prostate cancers with drug combinations including HDACi.""","""['Umamaheswari Natarajan', 'Thiagarajan Venkatesan', 'Vijayaraghavan Radhakrishnan', 'Shila Samuel', 'Periannan Rasappan', 'Appu Rathinavelu']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Medicina (Kaunas)""","""['Differential Mechanisms of Cell Death Induced by HDAC Inhibitor SAHA and MDM2 Inhibitor RG7388 in MCF-7 Cells.', 'The role of p21(waf1/cip1) and p27(Kip1) in HDACi-mediated tumor cell death and cell cycle arrest in the Eμ-myc model of B-cell lymphoma.', 'Co-delivery of p53 and MDM2 inhibitor RG7388 using a hydroxyl terminal PAMAM dendrimer derivative for synergistic cancer therapy.', 'Histone deacetylase inhibitors: signalling towards p21cip1/waf1.', 'MDM2 antagonists as a novel treatment option for acute myeloid leukemia: perspectives on the therapeutic potential of idasanutlin (RG7388).', 'Gain of Function (GOF) Mutant p53 in Cancer-Current Therapeutic Approaches.', 'Chidamide and venetoclax synergistically exert cytotoxicity on multiple myeloma by upregulating BIM expression.', 'Rational design of synthetically tractable HDAC6/HSP90 dual inhibitors to destroy immune-suppressive tumor microenvironment.', 'Transcription Factors as Novel Therapeutic Targets and Drivers of Prostate Cancer Progression.', 'Purshia plicata Triggers and Regulates Proteins Related to Apoptosis in HeLa Cancer Cells.']"""

This phenomenon is termed MET dependence. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) first indicated that the MET-dependent SV40-transformed cancer cells were arrested in the S and G2 phases of the cell cycle when under MR. This is in contrast to a G1-phase accumulation of cells, which occurs only in MET-supplemented medium at very high cell densities and which is similar to the G1 cell-cycle block which occurs in cultures of normal fibroblasts at high density. When the human PC-3 prostate carcinoma cell line was cultured in MET-free, homocysteine-containing (MET-HCY+) medium, there was an extreme increment in DNA content without cell division indicating that the cells were blocked in S phase. Recombinant methioninase (rMETase) treatment of cancer cells also selectively trapped cancer cells in S/G2: The cell cycle phase of the cancer cells was visualized with the fluorescence ubiquitination cell cycle indicator (FUCCI). At the time of rMETase-induced S/G2-phase trap, identified by the cancer cells' green fluorescence by FUCCI imaging, the cancer cells were administered S-phase-dependent chemotherapy drugs, which interact with DNA or block DNA synthesis such as doxorubicin, cisplatin, or 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and which were highly effective in killing the cancer cells. In contrast, treatment of cancer cells with drugs in the presence of MET, only led to the majority of the cancer cell population being blocked in G0/G1 phase, identified by the cancer cells becoming red fluorescent in the FUCCI system.

ASG-5ME, an SLC44A4-targeting antibody carrying monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE), a microtubule-disrupting agent, was investigated in men with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer. Methods The primary objective of this phase I study was to determine maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended phase II dose. Secondary objectives were safety, antitumor activity, pharmacokinetic properties, immunogenicity, and the detection of SLC44A4 on circulating tumor cells. Patients (pts) were treated among 7 dose levels every 21 days. A dose expansion phase enrolled 20 additional pts. at the MTD. Results Twenty-six and 20 pts. were treated in dose escalation and dose expansion cohorts respectively. The MTD was 2.7 mg/kg. Dose-limiting toxicities occurred in 4 pts.: grade 3 fatigue (n = 1); grade 3 abdominal pain, diarrhea and fatigue (n = 1); grade 4 neutropenia and hyponatremia and grade 3 maculopapular rash, constipation and hypoxia (n = 1); grade 3 troponin elevation without cardiac sequelae (n = 1). Fatigue and diarrhea were the most prevalent adverse events (AEs) across all cycles. Two grade 5 AEs occurred in the dose expansion cohort, each after 1 dose: 1 pt. developed grade 3 hyperglycemia, renal insufficiency and leukopenia; 1 pt. developed grade 3 hyperglycemia complicated by bacteremia. Free MMAE levels did not accumulate with repeat dosing. Of evaluable pts., 52% had either stable disease or a partial response. Conclusions Further development of ASG-5ME is not being pursued due to its narrow therapeutic index.

However, the safety of these recommendations is based on non-urological surgical experiences. Our objective was to verify the safety of these recommendations in patients undergoing radical prostatectomy (RP).  Materials and methods:   Patients regularly receiving a DOAC and scheduled for RP at our institution were prospectively assessed. DOAC intake was usually stopped 48 h before surgery without any preoperative bridging therapy. Postoperatively, patients received risk-adapted low-molecular weight heparin (LMWH). On the third day after unremarkable RP, DOAC intake was restarted and the administration of LMWH was stopped. We assessed perioperative outcomes and 30-day morbidity.  Results:   Thirty-two consecutive patients receiving DOAC underwent RP at our institution between 12/2017 and 07/2018. Time of surgery (median, 177 min) and intraoperative blood loss (median, 500 mL) were unremarkable. DOACs were restarted on the third postoperative day in 30 patients (94%). No patient had a significant hemoglobin level reduction after DOAC restart. Overall, 28% of patients experienced complications within 30 days after surgery. Most of which were minor (Clavien ≤ 2), three patients (9%), however, had Clavien ≥ 3 complications.  Conclusion:   Our report is the first to prospectively assess current guideline recommendations regarding DOAC restarting after major urological surgery. RP can safely be performed, if DOACs are correctly paused before surgery. Moreover, in case of an uneventful postoperative clinical course, DOACs can be safely restarted on the third postoperative day.

Methods:   In total, 1075 HRPC patients undergoing definitive radiotherapy (RT) between 1995 and 2010 were retrospectively reviewed. Median follow-up was 62.3 months. Patients received either dose-escalated external beam radiotherapy (n=628, EBRT) or combined-modality radiotherapy (n=447, pelvic RT and low-dose rate brachytherapy boost, CMRT). 82.9% received androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT). A prognostic model stratified patients into predefined groups (good, intermediate, and poor). Kaplan-Meier methods and Cox proportional hazards regressions assessed biochemical failure (BF), distant metastasis (DM), prostate cancer-specific mortality (PCSM) and overall mortality (OM). C-indices analyzed predictive value.  Results:   The model was prognostic; C-indices for BF, DM, PCSM and OM were: 0.62, 0.64, 0.61, and 0.57. On multivariate analysis, CMRT and longer ADT (≥24 mo) were associated with improved BF, DM, and PCSM. Gleason score (GS) 9-10 was the strongest predictor of PCSM. C-indices for BF, DM, PCSM, and OM using a 4-compartment model incorporating GS 9-10 were: 0.62, 0.65, 0.68, and 0.56. In poor-prognosis patients (GS 8-10+additional risk factors), CMRT+LTADT (>12 mo) had 10-year PCSM (3.7%±3.6%), comparing favorably to 25.8%±9.2% with EBRT+LTADT.  Conclusions:   The model applies to high-risk RT patients; GS 9-10 remains a powerful predictor of PCSM. Comparing similar prognosis patients, CMRT is associated with improved disease-specific outcomes relative to EBRT. In poor-prognosis patients, CMRT+LTADT yields superior 10-year PCSM, potentially improving RT treatment personalization for those with HRPC.""","""['Benjamin Foster', 'William Jackson', 'Corey Foster', 'Robert Dess', 'Eyad Abu-Isa', 'Patrick William McLaughlin', 'Gregory Merrick', 'Jason Hearn', 'Daniel Spratt', 'Stanley Liauw', 'Daniel Hamstra']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Am J Clin Oncol""","""['Interval to biochemical failure predicts clinical outcomes in patients with high-risk prostate cancer treated by combined-modality radiation therapy.', 'The addition of low-dose-rate brachytherapy and androgen-deprivation therapy decreases biochemical failure and prostate cancer death compared with dose-escalated external-beam radiation therapy for high-risk prostate cancer.', 'Ten-year survival after High-Dose-Rate Brachytherapy combined with External Beam Radiation Therapy in high-risk prostate cancer: A comparison with the Norwegian SPCG-7 cohort.', 'American Brachytherapy Society Task Group Report: Combination of brachytherapy and external beam radiation for high-risk prostate cancer.', 'Radiation treatment in prostate cancer: covering the waterfront.', 'Does brachytherapy boost improve survival outcomes in Gleason Grade Group 5 patients treated with external beam radiotherapy and androgen deprivation therapy?

Methodology: The data derived from a representative cross-sectional study of patients with advanced cancer. Patients who had been in contact with 1 of 54 hospital departments were invited to fill out a questionnaire on symptoms and problems. Five items asked about sexuality. Ordinal logistic regression was used to identify variables associated with sexual functioning in explorative analyses. Results: A total of 1,447 patients completed the questionnaire and of those, 961 patients (66%) completed the sexuality items. More than half of the patients (60%) had not been sexually active within the previous month, despite a high prevalence of desire for sexual intimacy (62%). More than half of the patients (57%) experienced that their physical condition or treatment had impaired their sex life. Of those, 52% experienced an unmet need for help with sexual problems from the health care system. Older patients were less likely to report sexual problems than younger patients.

Here, using RNA immunoprecipitation-sequencing (RIP-seq), we identified the Polycomb-group histone methyltransferase EZH2 as a p53 mRNA-binding protein. EZH2 bound to an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) in the 5'UTR of p53 mRNA and enhanced p53 protein translation in a methyltransferase-independent manner. EZH2 augmented p53 GOF mutant-mediated cancer growth and metastasis by increasing protein levels of mutant p53. EZH2 overexpression was associated with worsened outcome selectively in patients with p53-mutated cancer. Depletion of EZH2 by antisense oligonucleotides inhibited p53 GOF mutant-mediated cancer growth.

Although patients traditionally relied on physician visits for cancer information, most adults now use the Internet as a primary source of health information.  Objective:   To evaluate whether US adults can accurately estimate survival for hypothetical prostate cancer patients using unrestricted Internet searching and an online nomogram.  Design, setting, and participants:   Adults were recruited at the Minnesota State Fair. Participants were shown a pathology report for a prostatectomy cancer specimen and asked to estimate the patient's 15-yr survival using an unrestricted Internet search. Participants were then asked to re-estimate using a freely available, validated prostate cancer nomogram.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Participants' answers were compared to a ""reference"" estimate and a ""ballpark"" estimate of ±10 percentage points of the ""reference"" value.  Results and limitations:   A total of 129 participants met the inclusion criteria and generated complete responses. Only 12% (95% confidence interval [CI] 7.8-19.2%) were within the ""ballpark"" estimate when using unrestricted Internet searching for overall survival estimates. 23% (95% CI 16.8-31.3%) correctly used the nomogram and 51% (95% CI 42.6-59.6%) estimated within the ""ballpark"" when using the nomogram.  Conclusions:   Use of an unrestricted Internet search often yields inaccurate estimations of life expectancy, while estimations significantly improve with nomogram use. Physicians should educate and guide patients towards credible online health resources, facilitate their effective use, and engage in discussion with patients regarding the utility of this information.  Patient summary:   The general public finds it difficult to estimate prostate cancer survival using unrestricted Internet searches. Most patients would benefit from Internet guidance from their clinicians to better understand prostate cancer pathology reports.""","""['Justin P Campagna', 'Lee Baumgarten', 'Lucas P Labine', 'Isaac Palma', 'Jacob A Albersheim', 'Niranjan Sathianathen', 'Christopher J Weight']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Eur Urol Focus""","""['Evaluating the predictive accuracy and the clinical benefit of a nomogram aimed to predict survival in node-positive prostate cancer patients: External validation on a multi-institutional database.', 'A Novel Nomogram for Survival Prediction of Patients with Spinal Metastasis From Prostate Cancer.', 'The CPC Risk Calculator: A New App to Predict Prostate-specific Antigen Recurrence During Follow-up After Radical Prostatectomy.', 'Optimum Tools for Predicting Clinical Outcomes in Prostate Cancer Patients Undergoing Radical Prostatectomy: A Systematic Review of Prognostic Accuracy and Validity.', 'Predicting Life Expectancy in Men Diagnosed with Prostate Cancer.']"""

We recently proposed effective shading correction methods, using planning CT (pCT) as prior information to estimate low-frequency errors in either the projection domain or image domain. In this work, we further improve the clinical practicality of our previous methods by removing the requirement of prior pCT images. Clinical CBCT images are typically composed of a limited number of tissues. By utilizing the low frequency characteristic of shading distribution, we first generate a 'shading-free' template image by enforcing uniformity on CBCT voxels of the same tissue type via a technique named partitioned tissue classification. Only a small subset of voxels in the template image are used in the correction process to generate sparse samples of shading artifacts. Local filtration, a Fourier transform based algorithm, is employed to efficiently process the sparse errors to compute a full-field distribution of shading artifacts for CBCT correction. We evaluate the method's performance using an anthropomorphic pelvis phantom and 6 pelvis patients. The proposed method improves the image quality of CBCT for both phantom and patients to a level matching that of pCT. On the pelvis phantom, the signal non-uniformity (SNU) is reduced from 12.11% to 3.11% and 8.40% to 2.21% on fat and muscle, respectively. The maximum CT number error is reduced from 70 to 10 HU and 73 to 11 HU on fat and muscle, respectively. On patients, the average SNU is reduced from 9.22% to 1.06% and 11.41% to 1.67% on fat and muscle, respectively. The maximum CT number error is reduced from 95 to 9 HU and 88 to 8 HU on fat and muscle, respectively.

We report 10-year outcomes for patients treated with intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) for localized prostate cancer with 70 Gy in 28 fractions at 2.5 Gy per fraction.  Methods and materials:   The study included 854 consecutive patients with localized prostate cancer treated with moderately hypofractionated IMRT and daily image guidance at a single institution between 1998 and 2012. Patients with a single intermediate risk factor were considered to have favorable intermediate-risk (FIR) disease, and those with multiple intermediate risk factors were considered unfavorable (UIR). Biochemical relapse-free survival, clinical relapse-free survival, and overall survival were analyzed using Kaplan-Meier analysis. Prostate cancer-specific mortality (PCSM) was analyzed using competing risk regression. All grade ≥3 genitourinary (GU) and gastrointestinal (GI) toxicities were recorded using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Event version 4.03, and cumulative incidence rates of GU and GI toxicity were calculated.  Results:   The median follow-up was 11.3 years (maximum, 19 years). For patients with low-risk (LR), FIR, UIR, and high-risk (HR) disease, the 10-year biochemical relapse free survival rates were 88%, 78%, 71%, and 42%, respectively, (P < .0001). The 10-year clinical relapse free survival were 95%, 91%, 85%, and 72% for patients with LR, FIR, UIR, and HR, respectively, (P < .0001). For all patients, the 10-year actuarial overall survival rate was 69% (95% confidence interval, 66%-73%), and the 10-year PCSM was 6.8% (95% confidence interval, 5.1%-8.6%) overall. For patients with LR, FIR, UIR and HR disease, the 10-year PCSM rates were 2%, 5%, 5%, and 15%. Long-term grade ≥3 GU or GI toxicity remained low with 10-year cumulative incidences of 2% and 1%, respectively.  Conclusions:   High-dose moderately hypofractionated IMRT with daily image guidance for localized prostate cancer demonstrates favorable 10-year oncologic outcomes with a low incidence of toxicity.

However, we aimed to evaluate how intraductal carcinoma (not graded) with comedonecrosis should be considered.  Methods and results:   From 52 radical prostatectomy patients, 40 were informative and evaluated with immunohistochemistry for basal cells. Clinical outcome was assessed for biochemical recurrence, metastatic disease and the need for adjuvant therapy. Comedonecrosis was predominantly located in intraductal carcinoma (24, 60%). However, nine (23%) had comedonecrosis within invasive cancer and seven (18%) within both invasive and intraductal carcinoma. Extraprostatic extension rarely showed comedonecrosis (5, 13%), but rather perineural invasion within cribriform glands. Tumours were largely high-stage (15, 38% pT3a and 19, 48% pT3b), with 15 (37%) having positive lymph nodes and four distant metastases. Most cases (25, 63%) had other patterns of Gleason pattern 5 (single cells, solid), although 10 were reclassified as containing no invasive pattern 5. Of these, most were pT3 (eight of 10), but none had positive lymph nodes. Lymph node metastases were more common in patients with invasive cancer containing comedonecrosis (P = 0.02), and the need for androgen deprivation was near significance (P = 0.07), but biochemical recurrence was not significantly different (P = 0.58).  Conclusions:   Prostate cancer with comedonecrosis is often intraductal; however, these tumours are largely high-stage, showing a higher rate of positive lymph nodes with invasive comedonecrosis. Immunohistochemistry may be considered when comedonecrosis may significantly change the tumour grade.

Patients and methods:   The expression of miR-1299 in 35 PCa tissues and para-carcinoma tissues, as well as PCa cell lines (PC-3) and prostatic epithelial cell line (RWPE-1), was detected by quantitative Real Time-Polymerase Chain Reaction (qRT-PCR). Then, we explored the possible targets of miR-1299 by searching online databases. NIMA-related kinase 2 (NEK2) was identified as a direct target gene of miR-1299. Subsequently, qRT-PCR, Western blot (WB), and luciferase reporter gene assay were used to further verify the correlation between miR-1299 and NEK2. To better characterize the role of miR-1299 and NEK2 in PCa, we conducted functional experiments (MTT, flow cytometry, scratch-wound, and transwell assay) by transfecting PC-3 cells with miR-1299 mimics and si-NEK2 in different groups.  Results:   The expression level of miR-1299 in PCa tissues was significantly lower than that of para-carcinoma tissues. Meanwhile, the expression of miR-1299 in PC-3 cells was also significantly downregulated when compared with RWPE-1 cells. Subsequent qRT-PCR, WB, and luciferase reporter gene assay verified that miR-1299 transcriptionally repressed NEK2 by interacting with the essential binding sequence in 3'-UTR. Also, functional experiments demonstrated that decreased expression of NEK2 resulting from miR-1299 up-regulation could remarkably inhibit the proliferation, invasion, and migration of PCa cells.  Conclusions:   Our study indicated that miR-1299 was a novel suppressor in PCa through its negative regulation of NEK2.

Resistance of mCRPC to docetaxel can be associated with elevated levels of soluble clusterin (sCLU) and growth differentiation factor‑15 (GDF‑15). Any strategies aiming to modulate sCLU and/or GDF‑15 in docetaxel‑resistant prostate cancer cells present a therapeutic interest. The present study reports the cytotoxic effect of a nitric oxide donor, glyceryl trinitrate (GTN), on docetaxel‑resistant mCRPC human cell lines and demonstrates that GTN displays greater inhibition of cell viability toward docetaxel‑resistant mCRPC cells than on mCRPC cells. It is also demonstrated that GTN modulates the level of expression of clusterin (CLU) which is dependent of GDF‑15, two markers associated with docetaxel resistance in prostate cancer. The results indicate that GTN represses the level of expression of the cytoprotective isoform of CLU (sCLU) and can increase the level of expression of the cytotoxic isoform (nuclear CLU) in docetaxel resistant cells. Furthermore, it was observed that GTN differentially regulates the level of the precursor form of GDF‑15 between resistant and parental cells, and that recombinant GDF‑15 can modulate the expression of CLU isoforms and counteract GTN‑induced cytotoxicity in resistant cells. A link was established between GDF‑15 and the expression of CLU isoforms.

In our preliminary experiments, it was also found that bortezomib (BZ; PS‑341) that inhibits 26S proteasome activity, acts as a downregulator of both PSMA and AR. In addition to evaluating the effects of BZ on protein expression, the present study evaluated and compared the anticancer effects of BZ on the growth of cells treated with BZ, docetaxel (DOC), or a combination of both. Western blot analysis was used to examine the expression levels of AR and PSMA. The knockdown effect of small interfering RNA (siRNA) and the drugs on the expression of either AR or PSMA was also evaluated. An MTT assay was performed in order to evaluate the inhibitory effects of the drugs on PC cells. The cell cycles were analyzed, and apoptotic cells were detected. The downregulation of AR and PSMA was observed using siRNA specific to AR or PSMA, and the inhibition of PSMA, as well as that of AR severely suppressed the growth of PC cells. The inhibitory effect of BZ alone on PSMA expression was similar to that of both AR‑ and PSMA‑specific siRNA, and this drug also induced the downregulation of AR and PSMA in PC cells. This phenomenon was confirmed even in cells transfected to overexpress PSMA. The apoptosis‑promoting effect of BZ on the cells was similar to that observed with BZ plus DOC, and more potent than that of DOC alone. BZ had the same inhibitory effect on the expression of AR and PSMA as did siRNA specific to AR or PSMA.

The purpose of this work was to characterize the performance of two MLC leaf-fitting algorithms, direct optimization and piecewise optimization, for real-time motion compensation with different plan complexity and tumor trajectories.  Methods:   To test the algorithms, both in silico and phantom experiments were performed. The phantom experiments were performed on a Trilogy Varian linac and a HexaMotion programmable motion platform. High and low modulation VMAT plans for lung and prostate cancer cases were used along with eight patient-measured organ-specific trajectories. For both MLC leaf-fitting algorithms, the plans were run with their corresponding patient trajectories. To compare algorithms, the average exposure errors, i.e., the difference in shape between ideal and fitted MLC leaves by the algorithm, plan complexity and system latency of each experiment were calculated.  Results:   Comparison of exposure errors for the in silico and phantom experiments showed minor differences between the two algorithms. The average exposure errors for in silico experiments with low/high plan complexity were 0.66/0.88 cm2 for direct optimization and 0.66/0.88 cm2 for piecewise optimization, respectively. The average exposure errors for the phantom experiments with low/high plan complexity were 0.73/1.02 cm2 for direct and 0.73/1.02 cm2 for piecewise optimization, respectively. The measured latency for the direct optimization was 226 ± 10 ms and for the piecewise algorithm was 228 ± 10 ms. In silico and phantom exposure errors quantified for each treatment plan demonstrated that the exposure errors from the high plan complexity (0.96 cm2 mean, 2.88 cm2 95% percentile) were all significantly different from the low plan complexity (0.70 cm2 mean, 2.18 cm2 95% percentile) (P < 0.001, two-tailed, Mann-Whitney statistical test).  Conclusions:   The comparison between the two leaf-fitting algorithms demonstrated no significant differences in exposure errors, neither in silico nor with phantom experiments.

The Gleason score is currently the most powerful prognostic predictor of patient outcomes; however, it suffers from problems in reproducibility and consistency due to the high intra-observer and inter-observer variability amongst pathologists. In addition, the Gleason system lacks the granularity to address potentially prognostic architectural features beyond Gleason patterns. We evaluate prostate cancer for architectural subtypes using techniques from topological data analysis applied to prostate cancer glandular architecture. In this work we demonstrate the use of persistent homology to capture architectural features independently of Gleason patterns. Specifically, using persistent homology, we compute topological representations of purely graded prostate cancer histopathology images of Gleason patterns 3,4 and 5, and show that persistent homology is capable of clustering prostate cancer histology into architectural groups through a ranked persistence vector. Our results indicate the ability of persistent homology to cluster prostate cancer histopathology images into unique groups with dominant architectural patterns consistent with the continuum of Gleason patterns. In addition, of particular interest, is the sensitivity of persistent homology to identify specific sub-architectural groups within single Gleason patterns, suggesting that persistent homology could represent a robust quantification method for prostate cancer architecture with higher granularity than the existing semi-quantitative measures. The capability of these topological representations to segregate prostate cancer by architecture makes them an ideal candidate for use as inputs to future machine learning approaches with the intent of augmenting traditional approaches with topological features for improved diagnosis and prognosis.""","""['Peter Lawson', 'Andrew B Sholl', 'J Quincy Brown', 'Brittany Terese Fasy', 'Carola Wenk']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Sci Rep""","""['Machine learning techniques on homological persistence features for prostate cancer diagnosis.', 'Automated gleason grading on prostate biopsy slides by statistical representations of homology profile.', 'Automated deep-learning system for Gleason grading of prostate cancer using biopsies: a diagnostic study.', 'The 2014 International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) Consensus Conference on Gleason Grading of Prostatic Carcinoma: Definition of Grading Patterns and Proposal for a New Grading System.', 'From Gleason to International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) grading of prostate cancer.', 'A universal null-distribution for topological data analysis.', 'The Stria Vascularis in Mice and Humans Is an Early Site of Age-Related Cochlear Degeneration, Macrophage Dysfunction, and Inflammation.', 'Tight basis cycle representatives for persistent homology of large biological data sets.', 'Machine learning techniques on homological persistence features for prostate cancer diagnosis.', 'Spatial Transcriptomic Analysis Reveals Associations between Genes and Cellular Topology in Breast and Prostate Cancers.']"""

A better understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in PCa chemoresistance could improve treatment of patients with PCa. In the present study, using immune histochemical, chemistry, and precipitation assays with cells from individuals with benign or malignant prostate cancer or established PCa cell lines, we found that the oncogenic transcription factor pre-B cell leukemia homeobox-1 (PBX1) promotes PCa cell proliferation and confers to resistance against common anti-cancer drugs such as doxorubicin and cisplatin. We observed that genetic PBX1 knockdown abrogates this resistance, and further experiments revealed that PBX1 stability was modulated by the ubiquitin-proteasomal pathway. To directly probe the impact of this pathway on PBX1 activity, we screened for PBX1-specific deubiquitinases (Dubs) and found that ubiquitin-specific peptidase 9 X-linked (USP9x) interacted with and stabilized the PBX1 protein by attenuating its Lys-48-linked polyubiquitination.

Materials and methods:   Overall, 562 patients undergoing TRUSP-Bx were included in the present study. All patients were administered a single-dose of oral LVFX (500 mg) in the morning and intravenous ISP (400 mg) 60 min before biopsy. All biopsies were performed via TRUSP-Bx with an 18-gauge needle, and 12-core specimens were routinely obtained. Before initiating antibiotic treatment, urine and blood bacterial cultures were tested to determine the causative microorganisms in the patients with acute bacterial prostatitis.  Results:   Acute bacterial prostatitis developed in three (0.53%) participants. The incidence rates of acute bacterial prostatitis in the low- and high-risk groups were 0.79% and 0.46%, respectively. These patients showed clinical symptoms of acute bacterial prostatitis 12-24 h after their biopsy. Escherichia coli (E. coli) was isolated in the urine or bladder cultures of all of patients. All three isolates were determined to be LVFX-resistant E. coli, although they had good sensitivity to aminoglycosides, cephalosporins, and carbapenems. All patients were administered antibiotic treatment (cephalosporin or carbapenem) immediately and were treated successfully with no evidence of further disease progression.

In this study, we investigated the feasibility and plan quality of this method by means of a retrospective observer study.  Methods and materials:   Current planning sessions were recorded to configure a bi-objective optimization model and to assess its applicability to our clinical practice. Optimization software, GOMEA, was then used to automatically generate a large set of plans with different trade-offs in the two objectives for each of 18 patients treated with high-dose-rate prostate brachytherapy. From this set, five plans per patient were selected for comparison to the clinical plan in terms of satisfaction of planning criteria and in a retrospective observer study. Three brachytherapists were asked to evaluate the blinded plans and select the preferred one.  Results:   Recordings demonstrated applicability of the bi-objective optimization model to our clinical practice. For 14/18 patients, GOMEA plans satisfied all planning criteria, compared with 4/18 clinical plans. In the observer study, in 53/54 cases, a GOMEA plan was preferred over the clinical plan. When asked for consensus among observers, this ratio was 17/18 patients. Observers highly appreciated the insight gained from comparing multiple plans with different trade-offs simultaneously.

Definitive treatment with hypofractionated radiotherapy has not been widely reported. We have routinely used standard regimens of hypofractionated radiotherapy for node-positive disease and report our results of toxicity, biochemical control and survival.  Materials and methods:   Medical records of patients diagnosed with prostate cancer between February 2011 and April 2016 with radiologically involved pelvic nodes on magnetic resonance imaging/computed tomography without distant metastases were analysed. All patients were treated with long-term androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) and hypofractionated radiotherapy. Acute and late toxicities were assessed using Radiation Therapy Oncology Group acute and late morbidity scoring criteria. Biochemical control and survival were computed using Kaplan-Meier survival statistics.  Results:   In total, 61 patients were identified with node-positive disease, with a median age of 68 years and a median initial prostate-specific antigen level of 40.1 ng/ml. Most, 50 (81.9%), had T3 disease; 47.6% had Gleason 8-10 disease. All were treated with hypofractionated intensity-modulated radiotherapy, predominantly 60 Gy/20 fractions/4 weeks, with a dose of 44 Gy/20 fractions to the pelvic nodes. Twenty-five patients (41%) who had residual radiologically enlarged nodes after 3-6 months of ADT received nodal boost to the involved nodes, to a dose of 54-60 Gy as simultaneous boost. Incidences of late grade 2 + gastrointestinal and genitourinary toxicities were 13.1 and 18%, respectively, with no grade 4 toxicities. With a median follow-up of 48 months, 15 (24.6%) patients developed biochemical failure, with only four locoregional failures. The 4-year biochemical control rate was 77.5% and overall survival was 91%. Patients who had residual enlarged nodes after initial ADT had worse biochemical control (53.9% versus 93.1% at 4 years, P < 0.001).  Conclusion:   Moderately hypofractionated radiotherapy using an established fractionation schedule with long-term ADT for node-positive prostate cancer patients is feasible and results in excellent biochemical control rates at 4 years, with acceptable late toxicity rates.

Although treatment technical optimization has greatly improved local tumor control, a considerable fraction of patients still experience relapse due to the development of resistance. Radioresistance is a complex and still poorly understood phenomenon involving the deregulation of a variety of signaling pathways as a consequence of several genetic and epigenetic abnormalities. In this context, cumulative evidence supports a functional role of microRNAs in affecting radioresistance, suggesting the modulation of their expression as a novel radiosensitizing approach. Here, we investigated for the first time the ability of miR-205 to enhance the radiation response of PCa models.  Methods:   miR-205 reconstitution by a miRNA mimic in PCa cell lines (DU145 and PC-3) was used to elucidate miR-205 biological role. Radiation response in miRNA-reconstituted and control cells was assessed by clonogenic assay, immunofluorescence-based detection of nuclear γ-H2AX foci and comet assay. RNAi was used to silence the miRNA targets PKCε or ZEB1. In addition, target-protection experiments were carried out using a custom oligonucleotide designed to physically disrupt the pairing between the miR-205 and PKCε. For in vivo experiments, xenografts generated in SCID mice by implanting DU145 cells stably expressing miR-205 were exposed to 5-Gy single dose irradiation using an image-guided animal micro-irradiator.  Results:   miR-205 reconstitution was able to significantly enhance the radiation response of prostate cancer cell lines and xenografts through the impairment of radiation-induced DNA damage repair, as a consequence of PKCε and ZEB1 inhibition. Indeed, phenocopy experiments based on knock-down of either PKCε or ZEB1 reproduced miR-205 radiosensitizing effect, hence confirming a functional role of both targets in the process. At the molecular level, miR-205-induced suppression of PKCε counteracted radioresistance through the impairment of EGFR nuclear translocation and the consequent DNA-PK activation. Consistently, disruption of miR-205-PKCε 3'UTR pairing almost completely abrogated the radiosensitizing effect.  Conclusions:   Our results uncovered the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying the radiosensitizing effect of miR-205. These findings support the clinical interest in developing a novel therapeutic approach based on miR-205 reconstitution to increase PCa response to radiotherapy.""","""['Rihan El Bezawy', 'Stella Tinelli', 'Monica Tortoreto', 'Valentina Doldi', 'Valentina Zuco', 'Marco Folini', 'Claudio Stucchi', 'Tiziana Rancati', 'Riccardo Valdagni', 'Paolo Gandellini', 'Nadia Zaffaroni']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""J Exp Clin Cancer Res""","""['miR-875-5p counteracts epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and enhances radiation response in prostate cancer through repression of the EGFR-ZEB1 axis.', 'MicroRNA-145 Modulates Tumor Sensitivity to Radiation in Prostate Cancer.', 'miR-27b and miR-34a enhance docetaxel sensitivity of prostate cancer cells through inhibiting epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition by targeting ZEB1.', 'Epigenetic interventions increase the radiation sensitivity of cancer cells.', 'MicroRNAs in Prostate Cancer Following Radiotherapy: Towards Predicting Response to Radiation Treatment.', 'Application of nano-radiosensitizers in combination cancer therapy.', 'Exosomal miRNAs-a diagnostic biomarker acting as a guiding light in the diagnosis of prostate cancer.', 'microRNA-205 in prostate cancer: Overview to clinical translation.', 'MiR-106b-5p Attenuates Neuropathic Pain by Regulating the P2X4 Receptor in the Spinal Cord in Mice.', 'RNAi-Based Therapeutics and Novel RNA Bioengineering Technologies.']"""

A panoply of biological processes is involved as the cause of these diseases.

Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia and Lymphoma. Eight protein families were found to have implications for these cancer types. Our results strikingly reveal that some of the proteins with implications in the cancerous cellular states were showing the structural organization disparate from the signature of the family it constitutes. The sequences were further mapped onto respective structures and compared with the entropic profile. The structures reveal that entropic scores were able to reveal the inherent structural bias of these proteins with quantitative precision, otherwise unseen from other analysis. Subsequently, the betweenness centrality scoring of each residue from the structure network models was resorted to explore the changes in dependencies on residue owing to structural disorder.

Notably due to overdiagnosis and overtreatment, various organisations have recently recommended against routine screening, potentially having an impact on incidence, mortality, and surgery rates. Our aim was therefore to examine whether secular trends in the incidence and mortality of prostate cancer, and in prostatectomy rates, have recently changed in Switzerland.  Methods:   We conducted a population-based trend study in Switzerland from 1998 to 2012. Cases of invasive prostate cancer, deaths from prostate cancer, and prostatectomies were analysed. We calculated changes in age-standardised prostate cancer incidence rates, stratified by tumor stage (early, advanced), prostate cancer-specific mortality, and prostatectomy rates.  Results:   The age-standardised incidence rate of prostate cancer increased greatly in men aged 50-69 years (absolute mean annual change +4.6/100,000, 95% CI: +2.9 to +6.2) between 1998 and 2002, and stabilised afterwards. In men aged ≥ 70 years, the incidence decreased slightly between 1998 and 2002, and more substantially since 2003. The incidence of early tumor stages increased between 1998 and 2002 only in men aged 50-69 years, and then stabilised, while the incidence of advanced stages remained stable across both age strata. The rate of prostatectomy increased markedly until 2002, more so in the 50 to 69 age range than among men aged ≥ 70 years; it leveled off after 2002 in both age strata. Trends in surgery were driven by radical prostatectomy. Since 1998, the annual age-standardised mortality rate of prostate cancer slightly declined in men aged 50-69 years (absolute mean annual change -0.1/100,000, 95% CI: -0.2 to -0.1) and ≥ 70 years (absolute mean annual change -0.5/100,000, 95% CI: -0.7 to -0.3).  Conclusions:   The increases in the incidence of early stage prostate cancer and prostatectomy observed in Switzerland among men younger than 70 years have concomitantly leveled off around 2002/2003. Given the decreasing mortality, these trends may reflect recent changes in screening and clinical workup practices, with a possible attenuation of overdiagnosis and overtreatment.""","""['Sabrina Jegerlehner', 'Arnaud Chiolero', 'Drahomir Aujesky', 'Nicolas Rodondi', 'Simon Germann', 'Isabelle Konzelmann', 'Jean-Luc Bulliard;NICER Working Group']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Overdiagnosis and overtreatment of thyroid cancer: A population-based temporal trend study.', 'Changes in prostate cancer incidence and treatment in USA.', 'Urban-rural differences in prostate cancer mortality, radical prostatectomy and prostate-specific antigen testing in Australia.', 'Population-based prostate cancer trends in the United States: patterns of change in the era of prostate-specific antigen.', 'Prostate-Specific Antigen-Based Screening for Prostate Cancer: Evidence Report and Systematic Review for the US Preventive Services Task Force.', 'Predicting the burden of cancer in Switzerland up to 2025.', 'Prostate cancer in young men represents a distinct clinical phenotype: gene expression signature to predict early metastases.', 'Health-related quality of life in long-term prostate cancer survivors after nerve-sparing and non-nerve-sparing radical prostatectomy-Results from the multiregional PROCAS study.', 'The relative risk of second primary cancers in Switzerland: a population-based retrospective cohort study.', 'Pathological upgrading in prostate cancer treated with surgery in the United Kingdom: trends and risk factors from the British Association of Urological Surgeons Radical Prostatectomy Registry.']"""

A voxel-based statistical analysis was applied to generate 3-dimensional dose-volume maps for different urinary symptoms, allowing the identification of corresponding SRSs with statistically significant dose differences between patients with or without toxicity. Each SRS was propagated back to each individual's native space, and dose-volume histograms (DVHs) for the SRSs and the whole bladder were computed. Logistic and Cox regression were used to estimate the SRS's prediction capability compared with the whole bladder.  Results:   A local dose-effect relationship was found in the bladder and the urethra. SRSs were identified for 5 symptoms: acute incontinence in the urethra, acute retention in the bladder trigone, late retention and dysuria in the posterior part of the bladder, and late hematuria in the superior part of the bladder, with significant dose differences between patients with and without toxicity, ranging from 1.2 to 9.3 Gy. The doses to the SRSs were significantly predictive of toxicity, with maximum areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.73 for acute incontinence, 0.62 for acute retention, 0.70 for late retention, 0.81 for late dysuria, and 0.67 for late hematuria. The bladder DVH was predictive only for late retention, dysuria, and hematuria (area under the curve, 0.65-0.72).  Conclusions:   The dose delivered to the urethra and the posterior and superior parts of the bladder was predictive of acute incontinence and retention and of late retention, dysuria, and hematuria. The dose to the whole bladder was moderately predictive.""","""['Eugenia Mylona', 'Oscar Acosta', 'Thibaut Lizee', 'Caroline Lafond', 'Gilles Crehange', 'Nicolas Magné', 'Sophie Chiavassa', 'Stéphane Supiot', 'Juan David Ospina Arango', 'Borris Campillo-Gimenez', 'Joel Castelli', 'Renaud de Crevoisier']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys""","""['Rectal and Urethro-Vesical Subregions for Toxicity Prediction After Prostate Cancer Radiation Therapy: Validation of Voxel-Based Models in an Independent Population.', 'Local dose analysis to predict acute and late urinary toxicities after prostate cancer radiotherapy: Assessment of cohort and method effects.', 'Role of principal component analysis in predicting toxicity in prostate cancer patients treated with hypofractionated intensity-modulated radiation therapy.', 'Current status of intensity-modulated radiation therapy for prostate cancer: History, clinical results and future directions.', 'The response of the urinary bladder, urethra, and ureter to radiation and chemotherapy.', 'Feature Importance Analysis of a Deep Learning Model for Predicting Late Bladder Toxicity Occurrence in Uterine Cervical Cancer Patients.', 'Deep learning-based segmentation of prostatic urethra on computed tomography scans for treatment planning.', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging-Guided vs Computed Tomography-Guided Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy for Prostate Cancer: The MIRAGE Randomized Clinical Trial.', 'Radiation pneumonitis prediction after stereotactic body radiation therapy based on 3D dose distribution: dosiomics and/or deep learning-based radiomics features.', 'Quality assurance for MRI-only radiation therapy: A voxel-wise population-based methodology for image and dose assessment of synthetic CT generation methods.']"""

Surgical castration increases LIMK2 expression in mouse prostates due to increased hypoxia. Similarly, human clinical specimens showed highest LIMK2 levels in CRPC tissues compared to other stages, while minimal LIMK2 was observed in normal prostates. Most notably, inducible knockdown of LIMK2 fully reverses CRPC tumorigenesis in castrated mice, underscoring its potential as a clinical target for CRPC. We also identified TWIST1 as a direct substrate of LIMK2, which uncovered the molecular mechanism of LIMK2-induced malignancy. TWIST1 is strongly associated with CRPC initiation, progression and poor prognosis. LIMK2 increases TWIST1 mRNA levels upon hypoxia; and stabilizes TWIST1 by direct phosphorylation. TWIST1 also stabilizes LIMK2 by inhibiting its ubiquitylation. Phosphorylation-dead TWIST1 acts as dominant negative and fully prevents EMT and tumor formation in vivo, thereby highlighting the significance of LIMK2-TWIST1 signaling axis in CRPC. As LIMK2 null mice are viable, targeting LIMK2 should have minimal collateral toxicity, thereby improving the overall survival of CRPC patients.""","""['Kumar Nikhil', 'Lei Chang', 'Keith Viccaro', 'Max Jacobsen', 'Callista McGuire', 'Shakti R Satapathy', 'Michael Tandiary', 'Meaghan M Broman', 'Gregory Cresswell', 'Yizhou J He', 'George E Sandusky', 'Timothy L Ratliff', 'Dipanjan Chowdhury', 'Kavita Shah']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Cancer Lett""","""['LIMK2: A Multifaceted kinase with pleiotropic roles in human physiology and pathologies.', 'Negative cross talk between LIMK2 and PTEN promotes castration resistant prostate cancer pathogenesis in cells and in vivo.', 'Phosphorylation-dependent regulation of SPOP by LIMK2 promotes castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'LIMK2-NKX3.1 Engagement Promotes Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Androgen receptor-dependent and -independent mechanisms driving prostate cancer progression: Opportunities for therapeutic targeting from multiple angles.', 'LIMK2: A Multifaceted kinase with pleiotropic roles in human physiology and pathologies.', 'LIMK2 promotes melanoma tumor growth and metastasis through G3BP1-ESM1 pathway-mediated apoptosis inhibition.', 'LIM Kinases, LIMK1 and LIMK2, Are Crucial Node Actors of the Cell Fate: Molecular to Pathological Features.', 'Comparative Analysis of Small-Molecule LIMK1/2 Inhibitors: Chemical Synthesis, Biochemistry, and Cellular Activity.', 'Choosing Kinase Inhibitors for Androgen Deprivation Therapy-Resistant Prostate Cancer.']"""

This study examined if this paradigm shift from rest to activity has been consolidated in health care professionals' (HCP') attitude. It was investigated if the two dimensions of attitude (rest and activity) are endorsed empirically within the theory of planned behavior (TPB). Differences between physicians and nurses were examined.  Methods:   Five hundred forty seven physicians and 398 nurses treating breast, prostate, or colorectal cancer patients completed a cross-sectional questionnaire. To assess attitude toward physical activity during cancer treatment, we developed a 15-item scale, which included original statements of HCP. TPB variables were assessed.  Results:   A factor analysis revealed the proposed distinction of attitude into two dimensions. The activity-paradigm was stronger represented in HCP' attitude compared with rest-paradigm (Mactivity-paradigm = 4.1 versus Mrest-paradigm = 2.7, p < 0.001). Additionally, the activity-paradigm had higher exploratory power in explaining intention to recommend physical activity in cancer patients. However, the rest-paradigm was able to explain intention to recommend physical activity over and above activity-paradigm (ΔR2 = 0.05). Nurses had higher scores on the rest-paradigm than physicians.  Conclusions:   The activity-paradigm has already been consolidated in HCP' minds. However, the rest-paradigm is still present in the daily routine of oncology physicians and nurses.

Methods:   A randomised controlled trial was conducted involving 189 heterosexual couples, where the man received a radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer. The trial groups were peer support vs. nurse counselling versus usual care. Primary outcomes were sexual adjustment, unmet sexual supportive care needs, masculine self-esteem, marital satisfaction, and utilisation of erectile aids at 2-, 3-, 4- and 5-year follow-up.  Results:   The effects of the interventions varied across the primary outcomes. Partners in the peer group had higher sexual adjustment than those in the usual care and nurses group at 2 and 3 years (P = 0.002-0.035).

Since vasectomy is a common and effective form of contraception, these implications are significant. Therefore, we sought to test this association in a large observational cohort.  Objective:   To evaluate the potential association between prior vasectomy and the risk of developing prostate cancer.  Materials and methods:   We evaluated the relationship between vasectomy and prostate cancer in the NIH-AARP Diet and Health Study. Of the 111,914 men, prostate cancer was identified in 13,885 men and vasectomies were performed in 48,657. We used multivariate analysis to examine the relationship between prostate cancer and vasectomy. We also performed propensity score-adjusted and propensity score-matched analysis.  Results:   Men utilizing vasectomy were more likely to be ever married, fathers, educated, white, and screened for prostate cancer. During 4,251,863 person-years of follow-up, there was a small association between vasectomy and incident prostate cancer with a hazard ratio of 1.05 (95% CI, 1.01-1.11). However, no significant association was found when looking separately at prostate cancer by grade or stage. Conclusions were similar when using propensity adjustment and matching. Importantly, a significant interaction between vasectomy and PSA screening was identified.  Discussion:   Estimates of the association between vasectomy and prostate cancer are sensitive to analytic method underscoring the tenuous nature of the connection. Given the differences between men who do and do not utilize vasectomy, selection bias appears likely to explain any identified association between vasectomy and prostate cancer.

Patients and methods:   Men who underwent mpMRI within 12 months of RP between January 2013 and August 2016 at three Australian sites were included (Central Coast, NSW, St Vincents Hospital, Melbourne, Vic., and Bendigo Hospital, Vic.). The results of mpMRI were compared with the final RP specimen to analyse the performance of mpMRI for significant prostate cancer detection, index lesion localization, prediction of T3 disease and lymph node metastasis. A comparison between mpMRI cases performed using the technical and reporting specifications of Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) version 1 and version 2 was also performed. Data analysis was performed using spss 24.0.  Results:   A total of 235 cases were included for analysis. mpMRI PI-RADS score ≥3 had a 91% sensitivity and 95% positive predictive value (PPV) for significant prostate cancer at RP. The overall concordance between index lesion location on mpMRI and RP specimen was 75%. The sensitivity for predication of significant prostate cancer was higher in the PI-RADS version 2 cases compared with PI-RADS version 1 (87-99%; P = 0.005).

However, most patients develop resistance and metastasis, and thus new therapeutic approaches are urgently required. Recent studies have identified widespread anti-tumor effects of zinc (Zn) in various tumor cell lines, especially prostate cancer cells. In this study, we examined the effects of Zn as an adjuvant to PTX in prostate cancer cells.  Methods:   PC3 and DU145 cells were treated with different concentrations of Zn and/or PTX. MTT assay was used to detect cell viability. Real-time cell analysis (RTCA) and microscopy were used to observe morphological changes in cells. Western blotting was used to detect the expression of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-related proteins. qPCR (reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction) was used to examine changes in TWIST1 mRNA levels. Cell invasion and migration were detected by scratch and transwell assays. shRNA against TWIST1 was used to knockdown TWIST1. Colony formation assay was used to detect cell proliferation, while Annexin V and propidium iodide (PI) staining was used to detect cell apoptosis.  Results:   Zn and PTX increased proliferation inhibition in a dose- and time-dependent manner in prostate cancer cells, while Zn increased prostate cancer cell chemosensitivity to PTX. Combined Zn and PTX inhibited prostate cancer cell invasion and migration by downregulating the expression of TWIST1. Furthermore, knockdown of TWIST1 increased the sensitivity of prostate cancer cells to PTX. In addition, Zn and PTX reduced cell proliferation and induced apoptosis in prostate cancer cells.  Conclusions:   Our results demonstrated that Zn and PTX combined therapy inhibits EMT by reducing the expression of TWIST1, which reduces the invasion and migration of prostate cancer cells. SiTWIST1 increased the sensitivity of prostate cancer cells to PTX. In addition, with prolonged treatment, Zn and PTX inhibited proliferation and led to prostate cancer cell apoptosis. Therefore, Zn may be a potential adjuvant of PTX in treating prostate cancer and combined treatment may offer a promising therapeutic strategy for prostate cancer.""","""['Ya-Nan Xue', 'Bing-Bing Yu', 'Ya-Nan Liu', 'Rui Guo', 'Jiu-Ling Li', 'Li-Chao Zhang', 'Jing Su', 'Lian-Kun Sun', 'Yang Li']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Periostin Mediates TGF-β-Induced Epithelial Mesenchymal Transition in Prostate Cancer Cells.', 'Thymoquinone inhibits cancer metastasis by downregulating TWIST1 expression to reduce epithelial to mesenchymal transition.', 'A ROS/STAT3/HIF-1α signaling cascade mediates EGF-induced TWIST1 expression and prostate cancer cell invasion.', 'The role of TWIST1 in epithelial-mesenchymal transition and cancers.', 'New insight towards development of paclitaxel and docetaxel resistance in cancer cells: EMT as a novel molecular mechanism and therapeutic possibilities.', 'Development of Novel Paclitaxel-Loaded ZIF-8 Metal-Organic Framework Nanoparticles Modified with Peptide Dimers and an Evaluation of Its Inhibitory Effect against Prostate Cancer Cells.', 'Integrated analysis of single-cell and bulk RNA sequencing identifies a signature based on macrophage marker genes involved in prostate cancer prognosis and treatment responsiveness.', 'Unraveling the Peculiar Features of Mitochondrial Metabolism and Dynamics in Prostate Cancer.', 'LncRNA GAS5 enhances tumor stem cell-like medicated sensitivity of paclitaxel and inhibits epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition by targeting the miR-18a-5p/STK4 pathway in prostate cancer.', 'Augmented EPR effect post IRFA to enhance the therapeutic efficacy of arsenic loaded ZIF-8 nanoparticles on residual HCC progression.']"""

Methods:   We investigated DHX15 expression in castration resistant prostate cancer specimens and the influence of DHX15 on the responsiveness of prostate cancer cells to DHT stimulation. We also explored the role DHX15 played in enzalutamide resistance and the interacting domain in DHX15 with AR. DHX15 expression level in human CRPC specimens and prostate cancer specimens was detected by tissue microarray (TMA) immunostaining analysis. Colony formation assay was performed to determine the proliferation of cells treated with enzalutamide or DHT. siRNAs were used to knockdown DHX15. The interactions between DHX15 and AR were detected using co-immunoprecipitation assay.  Results:   The expression level of DHX15 was upregulated in human CRPC specimens compared with hormone naïve prostate cancer specimens. DHX15 knockdown reduced AR sensitivity to low DHT concentrations in C4-2 cells. Inactivation of DHX15 sensitizes the enzalutamide treatment in C4-2 cells. Deletion mutagenesis indicated that DHX1 5 interacts with AR through its N terminal domain.  Conclusions:   These findings suggest that DHX15 contributes to prostate cancer progression.

Gamma-index analysis, the most commonly used method to evaluate dosimetric accuracy, has low sensitivity to discrepancies that occur outside of this region. The objective of this study was to develop an evaluation method with high sensitivity across dose distributions spanning three orders of magnitude.  Methods:   We generalized the gamma index to include an additional criterion, the absolute absorbed dose difference, specifically for the low-dose region (i.e., D ≤ 5%). We also proposed a method to objectively select the appropriate magnitudes for relative-dose-difference, absolute-dose-difference, and distance-to-agreement criteria. We demonstrated the generalized gamma-index method by first finding the appropriate generalized gamma-index agreement criteria at an interval of specified passing rates. Next, we used the generalized gamma index to evaluate one-, two-, and three-dimensional absorbed dose distributions in a water-box phantom and voxelized patient geometry.  Results:   Generalized gamma-index passing rates for one-, two-, and three-dimensional dose distributions were 55.4%, 44.5%, and 8.9%, respectively. Traditional gamma-index passing rates were 100%, 97.8%, and 96.4%, respectively. These results reveal that the generalized method has adequate sensitivity in all regions (i.e., therapeutic and low dose). Additionally, the algorithmic determination of triplets of agreement criteria revealed that they are strong functions of the specified passing rate.  Conclusions:   The major finding of this work is that the proposed method provides an objective evaluation of the agreement of dose distributions spanning three orders of magnitude. In particular, this generalized method correctly characterized dosimetric agreement in the low-dose region, which was not possible by traditional methods. The proposed algorithmic selection of agreement criteria decreased subjectivity and requirements of user judgment and skill. This method could find utility in a variety of applications including dose-algorithm development and translation.""","""['Lydia J Wilson', 'Wayne D Newhauser', 'Christopher W Schneider']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Quantitative evaluation of 3D dosimetry for stereotactic volumetric-modulated arc delivery using COMPASS.', 'Assessment of Monte Carlo algorithm for compliance with RTOG 0915 dosimetric criteria in peripheral lung cancer patients treated with stereotactic body radiotherapy.', 'Clinical experience with EPID dosimetry for prostate IMRT pre-treatment dose verification.', 'Commissioning of the Mobius3D independent dose verification system for TomoTherapy.', 'Influence of the jaw tracking technique on the dose calculation accuracy of small field VMAT plans.', 'Analytical models for external photon beam radiotherapy out-of-field dose calculation: a scoping review.', 'Systematic Review on Multilevel Analysis of Radiation Effects on Bone Microarchitecture.', 'Dosimetric Validation of a System to Treat Moving Tumors Using Scanned Ion Beams That Are Synchronized With Anatomical Motion.']"""

Previous studies have shown strong associations between CHD1 deletion, prostate specific antigen [PSA] recurrence, and absence of ERG fusion. In this preliminary study we seek to find whether there is an independent correlation between CHD1 status and response to androgen deprivation therapy[ADT].  Materials and methods:   We identified 11 patients with prostate cancer who underwent prostatectomy and received at least 7 months of ADT at our institution. They were divided into undetectable [PSA < 0.2 ng/mL; n = 8] and detectable [PSA > 0.2 ng/mL; n = 3] according to their serum PSA nadir after 7 months of ADT. Tissue microarray was generated from their formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded prostatectomy and involved lymph node tissues. Fluorescence in situ hybridization [FISH] analysis for CHD1 and immunohistochemical stains for PSA, AR, PTEN, ERG and SPINK1 were performed.  Results:   Our results showed heterogeneity of FISH and immunostains expressions in different foci of tumor. Status of CHD1, ERG, PTEN, or SPINK1 did not correlate with one another or with response to ADT.

We report population-wide functional outcomes and HRQOL in men with all stages of prostate cancer and identify implications for health-care delivery.  Methods:   For this population-based study, men in the UK living 18-42 months after diagnosis of prostate cancer were identified through cancer registration data. A postal survey was administered, which contained validated measures to assess functional outcomes (urinary incontinence, urinary irritation and obstruction, bowel, sexual, and vitality and hormonal function), measured with the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite short form (EPIC-26), plus questions about use of interventions for sexual dysfunction) and generic HRQOL (assessed with the 5-level EuroQol five dimensions questionnaire [EQ-5D-5L] measuring mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain or discomfort, and anxiety or depression, plus a rating of self-assessed health). Log-linear and binary logistic regression models were used to compare functional outcomes and HRQOL across diagnostic stages and self-reported treatment groups. Each model included adjustment for age, socioeconomic deprivation, and number of other long-term conditions.  Findings:   35 823 (60·8%) of 58 930 men responded to the survey. Disease stage was known for 30 733 (85·8%) of 35 823 men; 19 599 (63·8%) had stage I or II, 7209 (23·4%) stage III, and 3925 (12·8%) stage IV disease. Mean adjusted EPIC-26 domain scores were high, indicating good function, except for sexual function, for which scores were much lower. Compared with men who did not receive androgen deprivation therapy, more men who received the therapy reported moderate to big problems with hot flushes (30·7% [95% CI 29·8-31·6] vs 5·4% [5·0-5·8]), low energy (29·4% [95% CI 28·6-30·3] vs 14·7% [14·2-15·3]), and weight gain (22·5%, 21·7-23·3) vs 6·9% [6·5-7·3]). Poor sexual function was common (81·0%; 95% CI 80·6-81·5), regardless of stage, and more than half of men (n=18 782 [55·8%]) were not offered any intervention to help with this condition. Overall, self-assessed health was similar in men with stage I-III disease, and although slightly reduced in those with stage IV cancer, 23·5% of men with metastatic disease reported no problems on any EQ-5D dimension.  Interpretation:   Men diagnosed with advanced disease do not report substantially different HRQOL outcomes to those diagnosed with localised disease, although considerable problems with hormonal function and fatigue are reported in men treated with androgen deprivation therapy. Sexual dysfunction is common and most men are not offered helpful intervention or support. Service improvements around sexual rehabilitation and measures to reduce the effects of androgen deprivation therapy are required.

However, it requires the generation of a synthetic CT (SCT) from MRIs for patient setup and dose calculation. In this study, we aim to investigate the accuracy of dose calculation in prostate cancer radiotherapy using SCTs generated from MRIs using our learning-based method. We retrospectively investigated a total of 17 treatment plans from 10 patients, each having both planning CTs (pCT) and MRIs acquired before treatment. The SCT was registered to the pCT for generating SCT-based treatment plans. The original pCT-based plans served as ground truth. Clinically-relevant dose volume histogram (DVH) metrics were extracted from both ground truth and SCT-based plans for comparison and evaluation. Gamma analysis was performed for the comparison of absorbed dose distributions between SCT- and pCT-based plans of each patient. Gamma analysis of dose distribution on pCT and SCT within 1%/1 mm at 10% dose threshold showed greater than 99% pass rate. The average differences in DVH metrics for planning target volumes (PTVs) were less than 1%, and similar metrics for organs at risk (OAR) were not statistically different. The SCT images created from MR images using our proposed machine learning method are accurate for dose calculation in prostate cancer radiation treatment planning. This study also demonstrates the great potential for MRI to completely replace CT scans in the process of simulation and treatment planning. However, MR images are needed to further analyze geometric distortion effects. Digitally reconstructed radiograph (DRR) can be generated within our method, and their accuracy in patient setup needs further analysis.""","""['Ghazal Shafai-Erfani', 'Tonghe Wang', 'Yang Lei', 'Sibo Tian', 'Pretesh Patel', 'Ashesh B Jani', 'Walter J Curran', 'Tian Liu', 'Xiaofeng Yang']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Med Dosim""","""['MRI-based treatment planning for brain stereotactic radiosurgery: Dosimetric validation of a learning-based pseudo-CT generation method.', 'Feasibility of MRI-only treatment planning for proton therapy in brain and prostate cancers: Dose calculation accuracy in substitute CT images.', 'Dosimetric study on learning-based cone-beam CT correction in adaptive radiation therapy.', 'Systematic Review of Synthetic Computed Tomography Generation Methodologies for Use in Magnetic Resonance Imaging-Only Radiation Therapy.', 'Deep learning methods to generate synthetic CT from MRI in radiotherapy: A literature review.', 'Clinical validation of MR imaging time reduction for substitute/synthetic CT generation for prostate MRI-only treatment planning.', 'Machine Learning in Prostate MRI for Prostate Cancer: Current Status and Future Opportunities.', 'MRI classification using semantic random forest with auto-context model.', 'Synthetic CT generation from weakly paired MR images using cycle-consistent GAN for MR-guided radiotherapy.', 'A review of deep learning based methods for medical image multi-organ segmentation.']"""

For example, the Top Scoring Pair (TSP) method seeks to find pairs of genes so that the probability of the reversal of the relative ranking of the expression levels of the genes in the two classes is maximized. The computational cost of finding a q-tuple of genes that scores highest under a given metric is O(Gq), where G is the total number of genes. This cost is often problematic or prohibitive in practice (even for q=2), as the number of genes G is often in the order of tens of thousands.  Methods:   In this paper, we show that this computational cost can be significantly reduced by excluding from consideration genes whose behavior is almost identical in the two classes and therefore their inclusion in any q-tuple is rather non-informative. Our criterion for the exclusion of genes is supported by a statistically robust metric, the Area Under the Curve (AUC) of the corresponding Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve. By filtering out genes whose AUC value is below a user-chosen threshold, as determined by a procedure that we describe in the paper, dramatic reductions in the run times are obtained while maintaining the same classification accuracy.  Results:   We have experimentally verified the gains of this approach on several case studies involving ovarian, colon, leukemia, breast and prostate cancers, and diffuse large b-cell lymphoma.  Conclusions:   The proposed method is not only faster (for example, we observed an average 78.65% reduction over the run time of TSP) while maintaining the same classification accuracy, but it can even result in better classification accuracy due to its inherent ability to avoid the so-called ""pivot"" (non-informative) genes that may intrude in q-tuples chosen otherwise.""","""['Alireza Khamesipour', 'Dimitri Kagaris']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Comput Methods Programs Biomed""","""['AUCTSP: an improved biomarker gene pair class predictor.', 'Tumor classification ranking from microarray data.', 'TSG: a new algorithm for binary and multi-class cancer classification and informative genes selection.', 'Hierarchical gene selection and genetic fuzzy system for cancer microarray data classification.', 'Relative expression analysis for molecular cancer diagnosis and prognosis.', 'Data analysis methods for defining biomarkers from omics data.']"""

Since prednisone is known to induce the cytochrome P450 iso-enzyme CYP3A4, which is the main metabolizing enzyme of docetaxel in the liver, a potential drug-drug interaction may occur. In this prospective randomized pharmacokinetic cross-over study we investigated docetaxel exposure with concomitant prednisone, compared to docetaxel monotherapy in men with metastatic prostate cancer.  Methods:   Patients scheduled to receive at least 6 cycles of docetaxel (75 mg/m2 ) and who gave written informed consent were randomized to receive either the 1st 3 cycles, or the last 3 consecutive cycles with prednisone (twice daily 5 mg). Pharmacokinetic blood sampling was performed during cycle 3 and cycle 6. Primary endpoint was difference in docetaxel exposure, calculated as area under the curve (AUC0-inf ) and analysed by means of a linear mixed model. Given the cross-over design the study was powered on 18 patients to answer the primary, pharmacokinetic, endpoint.  Results:   Eighteen evaluable patients were included in the trial.

Methods:   Sixty-eight patients underwent prostate cancer low-dose-rate (LDR) brachytherapy using radioactive seeds stranded with positive contrast MR-signal seed markers and were scanned using a balanced steady-state free precession pulse sequence with and without an endorectal coil (ERC). A sliding-window CNN algorithm (SeedNet) was developed to scan the prostate images using 3D sub-windows and to identify the implanted radioactive seeds. The algorithm was trained on sub-windows extracted from 18 patient images. Seed detection performance was evaluated by computing precision, recall, F1 -score, false discovery rate, and false-negative rate. Seed localization performance was evaluated by computing the RMS error (RMSE) between the manually identified and algorithm-inferred seed locations. SeedNet was implemented into a clinical software package and evaluated on sub-windows extracted from 40 test patients.  Results:   SeedNet achieved 97.6 ± 2.2% recall and 97.2 ± 1.9% precision for radioactive seed detection and 0.19 ± 0.04 mm RMSE for seed localization in the images acquired with an ERC. Without the ERC, the recall remained high, but the false-positive rate increased; the RMSE of the seed locations increased marginally. The clinical integration of SeedNet slightly increased the run-time, but the overall run-time was still low.

However, the expression patterns and underlying molecular mechanisms of AR in gastric cancer (GC) are not fully understood. This study aimed to detect the expression of AR-Vs in GC and explored their role in metastasis of GC. Here, the AR expression form was identified in GC cell lines and tissues by RT-PCR and qPCR. Transwell assays and experimental lung metastasis animal models were used to assess the function of AR in cell migration and invasion. Downstream targets of AR were screened by bioinformatics, and identified by luciferase reporter assays and electrophoretic mobility shift assays. AR-v12 was identified as the main expression form in GC cell lines and tissues. Different from full length of AR, AR-v12 was localized to the nucleus independent of androgen. Upregulation of AR-v12 in primary GC tissues was significantly associated with metastasis. Overexpression of AR-v12 promoted migration and invasion independent of androgen. Knockdown of AR-v12 inhibited migration and invasion in vitro, as well as metastasis in vivo. Furthermore, AR-v12, serving as a transcription factor, promoted metastasis through regulating the promoter activity of MYLK. In AR-v12 overexpressing cells, knockdown of MYLK inhibited cell migration and invasion, while in AR-v12 knocked-down cells, overexpression of MYLK promoted cell migration and invasion. Collectively, our study demonstrates that AR-v12 is highly expressed in GC tissues and promotes migration and invasion through directly regulating MYLK.

Targeting PCa cells before their progression to mCRPC would greatly improve the outcome. Combination therapy targeting the DNA Damage Response (DDR) has been limited by general toxicity, and a goal of clinical trials is how to target the DDR more specifically. We now show that androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) of LNCaP cells results in increased expression of TLK1B, a key kinase upstream of NEK1 and ATR and mediating the DDR that typically results in a temporary cell cycle arrest of androgen responsive PCa cells. Following DNA damage, addition of the TLK specific inhibitor, thioridazine (THD), impairs ATR and Chk1 activation, establishing the existence of a ADT > TLK1 > NEK1 > ATR > Chk1, DDR pathway, while its abrogation leads to apoptosis. Treatment with THD suppressed the outgrowth of androgen-independent (AI) colonies of LNCaP and TRAMP-C2 cells cultured with bicalutamide. Moreover, THD significantly inhibited the growth of several PCa cells in vitro (including AI lines). Administration of THD or bicalutamide was not effective at inhibiting long-term tumor growth of LNCaP xenografts. In contrast, combination therapy remarkably inhibited tumor growth via bypass of the DDR. Moreover, xenografts of LNCaP cells overexpressing a NEK1-T141A mutant were durably suppressed with bicalutamide. Collectively, these results suggest that targeting the TLK1/NEK1 axis might be a novel therapy for PCa in combination with standard of care (ADT).""","""['Vibha Singh', 'Praveen Kumar Jaiswal', 'Ishita Ghosh', 'Hari K Koul', 'Xiuping Yu', 'Arrigo De Benedetti']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Int J Cancer""","""['Tousled-like kinase 1: a novel factor with multifaceted role in mCRPC progression and development of therapy resistance.', 'The TLK1-Nek1 axis promotes prostate cancer progression.', 'The TLK1/Nek1 axis contributes to mitochondrial integrity and apoptosis prevention via phosphorylation of VDAC1.', 'Identification of the proteome complement of humanTLK1 reveals it binds and phosphorylates NEK1 regulating its activity.', 'Androgen action in the prostate gland.', ""Targeting Prostate Cancer, the 'Tousled Way'."", 'Androgen Deprivation Freezes Hormone-Sensitive Prostate Cancer Cells in a Reversible, Genetically Unstable Quasi-Apoptotic State, Bursting into Full Apoptosis upon Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerase Inhibition.', 'Identification of biological pathways and processes regulated by NEK5 in breast epithelial cells via an integrated proteomic approach.', 'The TLK1-MK5 Axis Regulates Motility, Invasion, and Metastasis of Prostate Cancer Cells.', 'Tousled-like kinase 1: a novel factor with multifaceted role in mCRPC progression and development of therapy resistance.']"""

Here, we present a statistical approach that extracts doubling times from progression-free survival (PFS) plots, which inherently contains information regarding the growth of solid tumors. Twelve cancers were investigated and multiple PFS plots were evaluated for each type. The PFS plot showing fastest tumor growth was deemed to best represent the inherent growth kinetics of the solid tumor, and selected for further analysis. The exponential tumor growth rates were extracted from each PFS plot, along with associated variabilities, which ultimately allowed for the estimation of solid tumor doubling times. The mean simulated doubling times for pancreatic cancer, melanoma, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), renal cell carcinoma, triple negative breast cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, hormone receptor positive (HR+) breast cancer, human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 positive (HER-2+) breast cancer, gastric cancer, glioblastoma multiforme, colorectal cancer, and prostate cancer were 5.06, 3.78, 3.06, 2.67, 2.38, 2.40, 4.31, 4.12, and 3.84 months, respectively. For all cancers, clinically reported doubling times were within the estimated ranges. For all cancers, except HCC, the growth rates were best characterized by a log-normal distribution. For HCC, the gamma distribution best described the data. The statistical approach presented here provides a qualified method for extracting tumor growth rates and doubling times from PFS plots.

Gleason growth patterns are defined by their histological features on 4- to 5-µm cross sections, and little is known about their three-dimensional architecture. Our objective was to characterize the three-dimensional architecture of prostate cancer growth patterns. Intact tissue punches (n = 46) of representative Gleason growth patterns from radical prostatectomy specimens were fluorescently stained with antibodies targeting Keratin 8/18 and Keratin 5 for the detection of luminal and basal epithelial cells, respectively. Punches were optically cleared in benzyl alcohol-benzyl benzoate and imaged using a confocal laser scanning microscope up to a depth of 500 µm. Gleason pattern 3, poorly formed pattern 4, and cords pattern 5 all formed a continuum of interconnecting tubules in which the diameter of the structures and the lumen size decreased with higher grades. In fused pattern 4, the interconnections between the tubules were markedly closer together. In these patterns, all tumor cells were in direct contact with the surrounding stroma. In contrast, cribriform Gleason pattern 4 and solid pattern 5 demonstrated a three-dimensional continuum of contiguous tumor cells, in which the vast majority of cells had no contact with the surrounding stroma. Transitions between cribriform pattern 4 and solid pattern 5 were seen. There was a decrease in the number and size of intercellular lumens from cribriform to solid growth pattern. Glomeruloid pattern 4 formed an intermediate structure consisting of a tubular network with intraluminal epithelial protrusions close to the tubule splitting points.

It is of concern for therapeutic applications of PSMA radioligands, because therapeutic radiation will damage these glands. A better understanding of the uptake mechanism is, therefore, crucial to find solutions to reduce toxicity. The aim of this study was to investigate whether the accumulation of PSMA-targeting radioligands in submandibular glands (SMGs) can be explained with PSMA expression levels using autoradiography (ARG) and immunohistochemistry (IHC). Methods: All patients gave written informed consent for further utility of the biologic material. The SMG of 9 patients, pancreatic tissue of 4 patients, and prostate cancer (PCA) lesions of 9 patients were analyzed. Tissue specimens were analyzed by means of PSMA-IHC (using an anti-PSMA-antibody and an immunoreactivity score system [IRS]) and ARG using 177Lu-PSMA-617 (with quantification of the relative signal intensity compared with a PSMA-positive standard). The SUVmax in salivary glands, pancreas, and PCA tissues were quantified in 60 clinical 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET scans for recurrent disease as well as the 9 primary tumors selected for ARG and IHC. Results: PCA tissue samples revealed a wide range of PSMA staining intensity on IHC (IRS = 70-300) as well as in ARG (1.3%-22% of standard). This variability on PCA tissue could also be observed in 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET (SUVmax, 4.4-16) with a significant correlation between ARG and SUVmax (P < 0.001, R2 = 0.897). On IHC, ARG, and 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET, the pancreatic tissue was negative (IRS = 0, ARG = 0.1% ± 0.05%, SUVmax of 3.1 ± 1.1). The SMG tissue displayed only focal expression of PSMA limited to the intercalated ducts on IHC (IRS = 10-15) and a minimal signal on ARG (1.3% ± 0.9%). In contrast, all SMG showed a high 68Ga-PSMA-11 accumulation on PET scans (SUVmax 23.5 ± 5.2). Conclusion: Our results indicate that the high accumulation of PSMA radioligands in salivary glands does not correspond to high PSMA expression levels determined using ARG and IHC.

To decipher such a puzzle, in the current study, we deciphered the role and mechanism of RPS7 during the progression of PCa.  Material and methods:   In this study, the expression of mRNA was performed by quantitative real-time PCR. The protein level was identified by Western blotting. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was demonstrated the relation between the abnormal expression of RPS7 mRNA and the overall survival. Cell proliferation was assessed by MTT assay and cell counting, meanwhile, cell migration was checked by transwell assay.  Results:   RPS7 is higher expressed in PCa (p < 0.001), and the overexpression of RPS7 is closely associated with poor outcome of PCa patients after radical prostatectomy (p < 0.001). Inhibition the expression of RPS7 with a specific RPS7 siRNA could markedly attenuate prostate tumor growth and migration (p < 0.05). Mechanistic data reveals that inhibition of RPS7 could up-regulate the epithelial protein marker, E-cadherin (p < 0.05), and down-regulate the mesenchymal protein markers, such as N-cadherin and Snail (p < 0.001).

In this work, we present a text mining system that constructs a gene-gene-interaction network for the entire human genome and then performs network analysis to identify disease-related genes. We recognize the interacting genes based on their co-occurrence frequency within the biomedical literature and by employing linear and non-linear rare-event classification models. We analyze the constructed network of genes by using different network centrality measures to decide on the importance of each gene. Specifically, we apply betweenness, closeness, eigenvector, and degree centrality metrics to rank the central genes of the network and to identify possible cancer-related genes.  Results:   We evaluated the top 15 ranked genes for different cancer types (i.e., Prostate, Breast, and Lung Cancer). The average precisions for identifying breast, prostate, and lung cancer genes vary between 80-100%. On a prostate case study, the system predicted an average of 80% prostate-related genes.  Conclusions:   The results show that our system has the potential for improving the prediction accuracy of identifying gene-gene interaction and disease-gene associations.

Sanguinarine (SNG), a quaternary benzophenanthridine alkaloid, has been shown to induce cytotoxicity in various human cancers and suppresses various pro-tumorigenic processes such as invasion, angiogenesis, and metastasis in different cancers. Lack of understanding the anticancer mechanism(s) of SNG has impeded the development of this molecule as a potential anticancer agent. Earlier, we have reported that SNG induces reactive oxygen species (ROS)-dependent ceramide (Cer) generation and Akt dephosphorylation, leading to the induction of apoptosis in human leukemic cells. In the present study, we demonstrate that SNG has potent anti-proliferative activity against prostate cancer cells. Our data suggest that SNG induces Cer generation via inhibiting acid ceramidase and glucosylceramide synthase, two important enzymes involved in Cer metabolism. Furthermore, we demonstrate that SNG induces ROS-depended extracellular signal-regulated kinase1/2 (ERK1/2) phosphorylation, and prostate apoptosis response-4 (Par-4) cleavage, leading to the induction of apoptosis in human prostate cancer cells.

Materials and methods:   Patients treated with iodine-125 BT were retrospectively assessed after at least 5 years of follow-up. Patients who received combination therapy (External beam radiation therapy-EBRT and BT) and salvage BT were not included.  Results:   406 men were included in the study (65.5% low-risk, 30% intermediate-risk, and 4.5% high-risk patients).

Morphology is then assessed by whole-well capturing of z-stack images. Compression of z-stacks creates a single in-focus image from which organoids are measured to quantify a variety of outputs, including circularity, roundness, and area.DNA, RNA, and protein can be collected from organoids recovered from the matrix gel. Cell populations of interest can be assessed by organoid dissociation and flow cytometry. Formalin-fixation-paraffin-embedding (FFPE) followed by sectioning is used for the histological assessment and antibody staining. Whole-mount immunofluorescent staining preserves organoid morphology and facilitates observation of protein localization in organoids in situ.

Therefore, galectin-1 inhibitors might represent novel therapeutic agents for cancer.  Methods:   A new series of heterocyclic imines linked coumarin-thiazole hybrids (6a-6r) was synthesized and evaluated for its cytotoxic potential against a panel of six human cancer cell lines namely, lung (A549), prostate (DU-145), breast (MCF-7 & MDA-MB-231), colon (HCT-15 & HT-29) using MTT assay.

Results:   Among all, compound 6g {3-(2-(2-(pyridin-2-ylmethylene) hydrazineyl) thiazol-4-yl)-2H-chromen-2- one} exhibited promising growth inhibition against HCT-15 colorectal cancer cells with an IC50 value of 1.28 ± 0.14 µM. The characteristic apoptotic morphological features like chromatin condensation, membrane blebbing and apoptotic body formation were clearly observed with compound 6g on HCT-15 cells using DAPI staining studies. Further, annexin V-FITC/PI assay confirmed effective early apoptosis induction by treatment with compound 6g. Loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and enhanced ROS generation were confirmed with JC-1 and DCFDA staining method, respectively by treatment with compound 6g, suggesting a possible mechanism for inducing apoptosis. Moreover, flow cytometric analysis revealed that compound 6g blocked G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle in a dose-dependent manner. Compound 6g effectively reduced the levels of Gal-1 protein in a dose-dependent manner.

Methods:   This analysis used five cross sections from the publicly available National Health and Nutrition Evaluation Survey (NHANES) from 2001 to 2010. A sample of 289 men with a history of prostate cancer was matched to a comparison group of 655 men with elevated prostate-specific antigen (> 4 ng/mL) but no reported diagnosis of prostate cancer. Analyses were stratified by diabetic or pre-diabetes status and treatment including surgery, radiotherapy, or both. Outcomes of interest included several broad macronutrient categories, HbA1c, body mass index, and obesity status. Multivariate regression analyses were conducted to clarify the associations of a prostate cancer diagnosis with these outcomes. Demographic and socioeconomic factors, including age, education, race, income, and marital status, were controlled for in all models.  Results:   The clinical and demographic characteristics were relatively well balanced between the ""at risk"" comparison group and the group of men diagnosed with prostate cancer. Diabetic or pre-diabetic men diagnosed with prostate cancer were more likely to be obese (p < 0.05) and have a higher BMI (p < 0.10). On multivariate analysis, compared to controls, men with prostate cancer treated with surgery and radiation therapy were predicted to have a higher BMI (p < 0.01) and were more likely to be obese (p < 0.05). These findings were largely driven by the diabetic and pre-diabetic sample. Further diabetics and pre-diabetics with prostate cancer treated with both radiation and surgery were predicted to consume an average of 72 and 59 more daily grams of carbohydrates and sugar, respectively, compared to controls (p < 0.05).  Conclusion:   Men with prostate cancer report fewer behaviors and outcomes consistent with optimal glycemic management including a higher BMI, and in diabetics and pre-diabetics, increased carbohydrate sugar consumption. Men with more intense treatment including surgery and radiotherapy appeared to be more likely to be obese and make poorer dietary carbohydrate and sugar choices compared to men without prostate cancer.  Implications for cancer survivors:   Men treated for prostate cancer have, on average, very long survivorship periods and are susceptible to diabetes and its complications.

Currently, there is a need to identify biomarkers to guide optimal sequential treatment in CRPC.  Methods:   This multicenter, retrospective analysis included 303 consecutive patients initially diagnosed with M0 or M1 CRPC between September 2009 and March 2017. Of these, 52 (17.2%) patients received pre-docetaxel ARAT agents and 189 (62.4%) patients received post-docetaxel ARAT agents. The prognostic ability of NLR at CRPC diagnosis regarding radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS) and cancer-specific survival (CSS) were investigated. For the analysis, the NLR level was dichotomized at 2.5, and evaluated according to sequencing strategy.  Results:   Multivariate analysis revealed NLR ≥ 2.5 as an independent predictor of a lower risk for CSS. During the median follow-up of 18.5 months, patients with NLR ≥ 2.5 exhibited significantly lower 1-year rPFS (p = 0.011) and 2-year CSS rates (p = 0.005) compared to patients with NLR < 2.5. Among patients with NLR < 2.5, the post-docetaxel ARAT agent sequencing group exhibited higher 1-year rPFS (p = 0.031) and 2-year CSS (p = 0.026) rates compared to the pre-docetaxel ARAT agent sequencing group. Among patients with NLR ≥ 2.5, rPFS and CSS rates were comparable regardless of ARAT agent sequencing.  Conclusion:   NLR ≥ 2.5 at CRPC diagnosis is associated with a lower risk for CSS.

The aim was to evaluate antitumor activity of Vitamin D-Nanoemulsion (NVD) in colorectal cancer cell lines and HCT116 xenograft model in a comprehensive approach.  Methods:   Two human colorectal cancer cell lines HCT116 and HT29 (gained from College of Pharmacy, King Saud University, KSA were grown. 3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyl tetrazoliumbromide protocol were performed to show the impact of NVD and β-catenin inhibitor (FH535) on the viability of HCT116 and HT29 cell lines. Apoptosis/cell cycle assay was performed. Analysis was done with a FACScan (Becton-Dickinson, NJ). About 10,000 cells per sample were harvested and Histograms of DNA were analyzed with ModiFitLT software (verity Software House, ME, USA). Western blotting and RT-PCR were performed for protein and gene expression respectively in in vitro and in vivo.  Results:   We found that NVD induced cytotoxicity in colorectal cells in a dose-dependent manner and time dependent approach. Further, our data validated that NVD administration of human colorectal cancer HCT116 and HT29 cells resulted in cell growth arrest, alteration in molecules regulating cell cycle operative in the G2 phase of the cell cycle and apoptosis in a dose dependent approach. Further our results concluded that NVD administration decreases expression of β-catenin gene, AKT gene and Survivin gene and protein expression in in vitro and in vivo.

Cells of metastatic origin exhibited lower height than cells derived from the primary tumour. Cell dry mass and CAV1 gene expression followed similar trends as cell stiffness.

The objective of the study was to examine the association between the circulating steroid metabolome with prognostic factors and progression.  Methods:   The prospective PROCURE cohort was recruited from 2007 to 2012, and comprises 1,766 patients with localized prostate cancer who provided blood samples prior to RP. The levels of 15 steroids were measured in plasma using mass spectrometry, and their association with prognostic factors and disease-free survival (DFS) was established with logistic regression and multivariable Cox proportional hazard models.  Results:   The median follow-up time after surgery was 73.2 months. Overall, 524 patients experienced biochemical failure and 75 developed metastatic disease. Testosterone and androsterone levels were higher in low-risk disease. Associations were observed between adrenal precursors and risk of cancer progression. In high-risk patients, a one-unit increment in log-transformed androstenediol (A5diol) and dehydroepiandrosterone-sulfate (DHEA-S) levels were linked to DFS with HR of 1.47 (P = 0.0017; q = 0.026) and 1.24 (P = 0.043; q = 0.323), respectively. Although the number of metastatic events was limited, trends with metastasis-free survival were observed for A5diol (HR = 1.51; P = 0.057) and DHEA-S levels (HR = 1.43; P = 0.054).  Conclusions:   In men with localized prostate cancer, our data suggest that the preoperative steroid metabolome is associated with the risk of recurrence of high-risk disease.  Impact:   The associations of adrenal androgens with progression of localized high-risk disease could help refine hormonal strategies for these patients.""","""['Eric Lévesque', 'Patrick Caron', 'Louis Lacombe', 'Véronique Turcotte', 'David Simonyan', 'Yves Fradet', 'Armen Aprikian', 'Fred Saad', 'Michel Carmel', 'Simone Chevalier', 'Chantal Guillemette']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev""","""['Preoperative Circulating 11-Oxygenated Androgens Are Associated With Metastasis-free Survival in Localized Prostate Cancer.', 'Serum Sex Steroids as Prognostic Biomarkers in Patients Receiving Androgen Deprivation Therapy for Recurrent Prostate Cancer: A Post Hoc Analysis of the PR.7 Trial.', 'Deletions of the androgen-metabolizing UGT2B genes have an effect on circulating steroid levels and biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy in localized prostate cancer.', 'Keyrole of endocrinology in the victory against prostate cancer.', 'Prostate-Specific Antigen-Based Screening for Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Evidence Review for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force Internet.', 'Sex steroid modulation of macrophages within the prostate tumor microenvironment.', 'Diagnostic and prognostic factors in patients with prostate cancer: a systematic review.', 'Steroidomics for the Prevention, Assessment, and Management of Cancers: A Systematic Review and Functional Analysis.', 'ZBTB46, SPDEF, and ETV6: Novel Potential Biomarkers and Therapeutic Targets in Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.']"""

Cancer is the second leading cause of death among the predominantly African American and Hispanic neighborhoods, with BS and BW having higher prostate cancer and colorectal mortality rates than New York City as a whole. There is significant opportunity to design cancer interventions that leverage the accessibility and acceptability of mobile health (mHealth) tools among the BS and BW communities.  Methods:   The Cancer Health Impact Program (CHIP) is a collaborative that was formed for this purpose. Through CHIP, we used a tablet-based, Health Information National Trends (HINTS)-based multimodality survey to collect and analyze social and demographic patterns of prostate cancer and colorectal cancer screening, as well as mHealth access, among BS and BW residents.  Results:   Among 783 participants, 77% reported having a smartphone, 40% reported access to a mobile health application, 17% reported blood stool kit testing, and 26% of men reported PSA test screening. Multivariable logistic regression models results demonstrated that participants who reported owning smartphones, but were unsure whether they had access to a health app, were also significantly more likely to report blood stool kit testing compared with participants without smartphones. In fully adjusted models, access to a health app was not significantly associated with PSA testing. Non-Hispanic white participants were 86% less likely to report blood stool kit testing when compared with non-Hispanic black participants [OR = 0.15; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.02-0.49]. Participants with a prior history of cancer were three times more likely to report blood stool kit testing when compared with those without cancer history (OR = 3.18; 95% CI, 1.55-6.63).  Conclusions:   For blood stool kit testing, significant differences were observed by race/ethnicity, cancer history, age, and smartphone use; for PSA screening, only age was significant in fully adjusted models.

Here, we characterize the functional cross-talk between FOXP3-c-MYC and TSC1-mTOR signaling during tumor progression. Deletion of Tsc1 in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) decreased phosphorylation of c-MYC at threonine 58 (pT58) and increased phosphorylation at serine 62 (pS62), an observation validated in prostate cancer cells. Conversely, inhibition of mTOR increased pT58 but decreased pS62. Loss of both FOXP3 and TSC1 in prostate cancer cells synergistically enhanced c-MYC expression via regulation of c-Myc transcription and protein phosphorylation. This crosstalk between FOXP3 and TSC1 appeared to be mediated by both the mTOR-4EBP1-c-MYC and FOXP3-c-MYC pathways. In mice, Tsc1 and Foxp3 double deletions in the prostate led to prostate carcinomas at an early age; this did not occur in these mice with an added c-Myc deletion. In addition, we observed synergistic antitumor effects of cotreating mice with inhibitors of mTOR and c-MYC in prostate cancer cells and in Foxp3 and Tsc1 double-mutant mice. In human prostate cancer, loss of nuclear FOXP3 is often accompanied by low expression of TSC1. Because loss of FOXP3 transcriptionally induces c-Myc expression and loss of TSC1 activates mTOR signaling, these data suggest cross-talk between FOXP3-c-MYC and TSC1-mTOR signaling that converges on c-MYC to regulate tumor progression. Coadministration of c-MYC and mTOR inhibitors may overcome the resistance to mTOR inhibition commonly observed in prostate cancer cells. SIGNIFICANCE: These results establish the principle of a synergistic action of TSC1 and FOXP3 during prostate cancer progression and provide new therapeutic targets for patients who have prostate cancer with two signaling defects.Graphical Abstract: http://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/canres/79/7/1413/F1.large.jpg.""","""['Lianpin Wu', 'Baozhu Yi', 'Shi Wei', 'Dapeng Rao', 'Youhua He', 'Gurudatta Naik', 'Sejong Bae', 'Xiaoguang M Liu', 'Wei-Hsiung Yang', 'Guru Sonpavde', 'Runhua Liu', 'Lizhong Wang']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Cancer Res""","""['Activation of PP2A and Inhibition of mTOR Synergistically Reduce MYC Signaling and Decrease Tumor Growth in Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma.', ""Tuberous sclerosis complex is required for tumor maintenance in MYC-driven Burkitt's lymphoma."", 'Differential impact of PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling on tumor initiation and progression in animal models of prostate cancer.', 'The ins and outs of MYC regulation by posttranslational mechanisms.', 'FOXP3 as an X-linked tumor suppressor.', 'FOXP3 Isoforms Expression in Cervical Cancer: Evidence about the Cancer-Related Properties of FOXP3Δ2Δ7 in Keratinocytes.', 'The Relationship Between the Tumor Cell Expression of Hypoxic Markers and Survival in Patients With ER-positive Invasive Ductal Breast Cancer.', 'TUBB4A interacts with MYH9 to protect the nucleus during cell migration and promotes prostate cancer via GSK3β/β-catenin signalling.', 'HDAC6/FOXP3/HNF4α axis promotes bile acids induced gastric intestinal metaplasia.', 'Forkhead Box Protein P3 (FOXP3) Represses ATF3 Transcriptional Activity.']"""

Methods:   Data from a single dose study to investigate the effect of leuprorelin in a 6-month depot formulation on T and PSA in prostate cancer patients were analysed using a population pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic modelling approach. The developed model was qualified using external data from 3 studies, in which the effect of different formulations of leuprorelin on T and PSA was evaluated in prostate cancer patients.  Results:   The effect of leuprorelin on the relationship between T and PSA was adequately characterized by the Romero model with minor modifications, combined with a turnover model to describe the delay in response between T and PSA. The data were significantly better described when assuming a minimum PSA level that is independent on the treatment-related reduction in T, as compared to a model with a proportional reduction in PSA and T.  Conclusions:   The model-based analysis suggests that on a population level, reducing T concentrations below 35 ng/dL does not result in a further decrease in PSA levels (>95% of the minimal PSA level is reached).

Here we investigated the effects of PFD on the proliferation of pancreatic cancer cells (PCCs) in vitro.  Method:   Human skin fibroblasts ASF-4-1 cells and human prostate stromal cells (PrSC) were used as fibroblasts. PANC-1, MIA PaCa-2, and BxPC-3 cells were used as human PCCs.

Under these experimental conditions, PFD also suppressed cell proliferation and induced G0/G1 cell cycle arrest in all PCCs. In PFD-treated PCCs, expression of p21 was increased but that of CDK2 was not clearly decreased. Of note, PFD did not induce significant apoptosis among PCCs.

Secondly to investigate the impact of geometric (PTV expansion) and dosimetric (conformity) imperfection of planning process on the PTV margin analysis. Prostate gland of ten patients were scanned with CCT and HDVCT techniques consecutively on a 320 slice volumetric CT scanner with wide field detector of 16 cm. Five radiation oncologists delineated CTV of the prostate. VMAT plans were developed with PTV margin of 4 mm and 6 mm (totaling 200 plans) and target coverage of each plan was evaluated on the target volume in agreement determined by shared voxels with three or more from 5 observers. Dosimetry on 200 VMAT plans showed that PTV margin for inter-observer variability were 6 mm and 4 mm for CCT and HDVCT techniques, respectively. It is about 3 mm smaller than our estimation from the previous study (8.8 mm and 7.3 mm) based on the inter-observer variability. This difference is mainly due to the accuracy of PTV volume expansion and limited dose conformity to guarantee target coverage. PTVs were measured 2 mm larger on average than the assigned margin. Planning iso-dose volume was found to be 2 mm larger than PTV. Regardless these limitations, enhanced image quality of HDVCT reduces PTV margin by 2 mm compared to CCT.

The proposed models are based on the stochastic frontier analysis formalism, a method of economic modeling. They act as a QC tool by predicting before the treatment planning process starts, the dosimetric coverage achievable for a HDR brachytherapy prostate plan. The geometric parameters considered in developing the models were: patient clinical target volume (CTV), organs at risk (OAR) volume, the bidirectional Hausdorff distance between CTV and OARs, and a fourth parameter measuring the catheters degree of non-parallelism within the target volume. Dosimetry parameters of interest are V100 for the CTV, V75 (bladder, rectum) and D10 (urethra). Results show that the built models can provide valuable information on the personalization of the optimization process based on the patient geometric parameters. The impact on the quality plan due to the planner's experience variability and judgment can be reduced by using those models, since the planner will attempt to achieve dosimetric parameters predicted by the models. Furthermore, the models provide information on the better trade-off between the target volume coverage and OARs sparing that can be achieved, regardless of the planner's experience; the latter being achieved by moving each plan at least around their respective frontier for V100, V75 and D10. The shortfall of the dosimetric parameters values computed by the treatment planning system (TPS) from those predicted by the models for a proportion of plans in the dataset reveals that optimized plans from a TPS, even clinically acceptable, are not necessarily the best that could be achieved. These represent 83% of plans in the training set for the target volume coverage (V100), ∼50% for the bladder (V75) and ∼72% for the urethra (D10).""","""['Paul Edimo', 'Angelika Kroshko', 'Luc Beaulieu', 'Louis Archambault']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Phys Med Biol""","""['A novel urethral sparing technique for high-dose-rate prostate brachytherapy after transurethral resection of the prostate.', 'High-dose-rate prostate brachytherapy consistently results in high quality dosimetry.', 'Focal high-dose-rate brachytherapy: a dosimetric comparison of hemigland vs. conventional whole-gland treatment.', 'Dosimetry analyses comparing high-dose-rate brachytherapy, administered as monotherapy for localized prostate cancer, with stereotactic body radiation therapy simulated using CyberKnife.', 'Automating the initial physics chart checking process.']"""

It has yet to be shown whether insurance status across different race has any implications on the stage of disease at the time of diagnosis. This study aimed to investigate whether insurance status was a modifier of the association between race and stage of previously undetected prostate cancer at the time of diagnosis in Florida between 1995 and 2013.  Methods:   Secondary data analysis of a cross-sectional survey using information from the Florida Cancer Data System (n = 224,819). Study participants included black and white males diagnosed with prostate cancer in Florida between 1995 and 2013. The main outcome variable was stage of prostate cancer at diagnosis. The main independent variable was race (black vs white). Adjusted logistic regression models were used to explore the association between race, insurance status and stage at diagnosis. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were calculated.  Results:   Black males were more likely to be diagnosed with late stage prostate cancer (OR 1.31; 95% CI 1.27-1.35). Being uninsured (OR 2.28; 95% CI 2.13-2.45) or having Medicaid (OR 1.84; 95% CI 1.70-1.98) was associated with a diagnosis of late stage cancer. Stratified analysis for health insurance revealed that blacks had an increased risk for late stage cancer if uninsured (OR 1.29; 95% CI 1.07-1.55) and if having Medicare (OR 1.39; 95% CI 1.31-1.48).

Although serious, most of these diagnoses are not terminal. Inherited risk for prostate cancer is associated with aggressive disease and poorer outcomes, indicating a critical need for increased genetic screening to identify disease-causing variants that can pinpoint individuals at increased risk for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.  Objective:   To identify positive (pathogenic, likely pathogenic, and increased risk) germline variants in a large prostate cancer cohort and to evaluate the usefulness of current practice guidelines in recognizing individuals at increased risk for prostate cancer who would benefit from diagnostic genetic testing.  Design, setting, and participants:   Cross-sectional study of data from 3607 men with a personal history of prostate cancer who underwent germline genetic testing between 2013 and 2018 and were unselected for family history, stage of disease, or age at diagnosis. Referral-based testing was performed at a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments/College of American Pathologists-certified diagnostic laboratory. All analysis took place between February 2017 and August 2018.  Main outcomes and measures:   The frequency and distribution of positive germline variants, and the percentage of individuals with prostate cancer who met National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines for germline genetic testing.  Results:   Of 3607 men (mean [SD] age at testing, 67 [9.51] years; mean age at diagnosis, 60 [9.05] years) with a personal diagnosis of prostate cancer who were referred for genetic testing, 620 (17.2%) had positive germline variants, of which only 30.7% were variants in BRCA1/2. Positive variants in HOXB13, a gene associated only with prostate cancer risk, were identified in 30 patients (4.5%). DNA mismatch repair variants with substantial known therapeutic implications were detected in 1.74% of variants in the total population tested. Examination of self-reported family histories indicated that 229 individuals (37%) with positive variants in this cohort would not have been approved for genetic testing using the NCCN genetic/familial breast and ovarian guidelines for patients with prostate cancer.  Conclusions and relevance:   Current NCCN guidelines and Gleason scores cannot reliably stratify patients with prostate cancer for the presence or absence of pathogenic germline variants. Most positive genetic test results identified in this study have important management implications for patients and their families, which underscores the need to revisit current guidelines.""","""['Piper Nicolosi', 'Elisa Ledet', 'Shan Yang', 'Scott Michalski', 'Brandy Freschi', ""Erin O'Leary"", 'Edward D Esplin', 'Robert L Nussbaum', 'Oliver Sartor']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""JAMA Oncol""","""['Germline genetic testing for inherited prostate cancer in practice: Implications for genetic testing, precision therapy, and cascade testing.', 'Intraductal/ductal histology and lymphovascular invasion are associated with germline DNA-repair gene mutations in prostate cancer.', 'Gene-based Confirmatory Germline Testing Following Tumor-only Sequencing of Prostate Cancer.', 'Bringing Prostate Cancer Germline Genetics into Clinical Practice.', 'Germline genetics of prostate cancer.', 'Performance of clinical risk scores and prediction models to identify pathogenic germline variants in patients with advanced prostate cancer.', 'Investigation of Clinically Significant Molecular Aberrations in Patients with Prostate Cancer: Implications for Personalized Treatment, Prognosis and Genetic Testing.', 'Usefulness of BRCA and ctDNA as Prostate Cancer Biomarkers: A Meta-Analysis.', 'ESR2 polymorphisms on prostate cancer risk: A systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Mismatch repair gene germline mutations in patients with prostate cancer.']"""

We assessed the sensitivity of magnetic resonance imaging before salvage robot-assisted radical prostatectomy in these men.  Materials and methods:   A total of 35 men underwent salvage robot-assisted radical prostatectomy after high intensity focused ultrasound partial ablation from 2012 to 2018. We compared clinicopathological characteristics before ultrasound and before salvage prostatectomy after ultrasound to histopathology on salvage prostatectomy. We assessed infield recurrence, out of field disease, positive surgical margins and magnetic resonance imaging sensitivity before salvage robot-assisted radical prostatectomy.  Results:   Before high intensity focused ultrasound 55.9% of men had multifocal disease and 47.1% had Gleason 3 + 3 disease outside the treatment field. Median time to salvage prostatectomy was 16 months (IQR 11-26). Indications for salvage prostatectomy were infield recurrence in 55.8% of cases, out of field recurrence in 20.6%, and infield and out of field recurrence in 23.5%. On salvage prostatectomy histopathology revealed significant cancer, defined as ISUP (International Society of Urological Pathology) 2 or greater, infield in 97.1% of cases, out of field in 81.3%, and infield and out of field in 79.4%. Of the cases 82.4% were adversely reclassified at salvage prostatectomy compared to 67.6% before ultrasound. The positive surgical margin rate was 40.0%. Of the positive margins 84.6% were in the region of previous ultrasound despite wide excision, including pT2 in 28.6%, pT3 in 47.6% and size 3 mm or greater, pT3 or multifocal (ie significant) in 31.4%. After ultrasound the sensitivity of magnetic resonance imaging for infield and out of field recurrence was 81.8% and 60.7%, respectively.  Conclusions:   Salvage robot-assisted radical prostatectomy may confer a higher risk of positive surgical margins, upgrading and up-staging than primary robot-assisted radical prostatectomy.

Multi-echo spin-echo signal decays to a non-zero offset due to imperfect refocusing pulses and Rician noise, causing T2 overestimation by the vendor's 2-parameter algorithm. The accuracy of the T2 estimate is improved, if the non-zero offset is estimated as a third parameter. Three-parameter Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) T2 estimation takes several minutes to calculate, and it is sensitive to initial values. We aimed for a 3-parameter fitting algorithm that was comparably accurate, yet substantially faster.  Methods:   Our approach gains speed by converting the 3-parameter minimisation problem into an empirically unimodal univariate problem, which is quickly minimised using the golden section line search (GS).  Results:   To enable comparison, we propose a novel noise-masking algorithm. For clinical data, the agreement between the GS and the LM fit is excellent, yet the GS algorithm is two orders of magnitude faster. For synthetic data, the accuracy of the GS algorithm is on par with that of the LM fit, and the GS algorithm is significantly faster.

Nevertheless, animal models of bone metastasis using several different tumor inoculation routes have been developed to help study bone metastatic progression, which occurs particularly in late-stage PCa patients. This chapter describes the protocols commonly used to develop models of bone metastatic cancer in mice using different percutaneous injection methods (Intracardiac and Intraosseous).

Methods:   We identified 205 men awaiting radical prostatectomy and assessed their usual dietary intake of carbohydrates using the 110-item Block food frequency questionnaire. We also evaluated carbohydrate intake quality using a score based on the consumption of sugars relative to fiber, fat, and protein. Logistic regression analyzed their associations with the odds of treatment failure, defined as a detectable and rising serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) or receiving androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) within 2 years.  Results:   Sucrose consumption was associated with a higher odds and fiber consumption with a lower odds of ADT after accounting for age, race/ethnicity, body mass index, and tumor characteristics (odds ratio [OR] (95% confidence interval [CI]) 5.68 (1.71, 18.9) for 3rd vs. 1st sucrose tertile and 0.88 (0.81, 0.96) per gram of fiber/day, respectively).

Optimal cutoff values for PSA nadir and TTN on survival were calculated with the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve.

The probe consists of a small ZD2 peptide specific to EDB-FN and a 64Cu-DOTA chelate. The probe was synthesized using standard solid-phase peptide chemistry and chelated to 64Cu prior to imaging. PET images were acquired at 4 and 22 h after intravenously injecting a 200 μCi probe into mice bearing human PC3 and LNCaP tumors, which represent highly aggressive and slow-growing prostate tumors, respectively. At 4 and 22 h postinjection, tumors could be clearly identified in the PET images. A significant higher signal was observed in PC3 tumors than in LNCaP tumors at 22 h (p = 0.01). Probe accumulation was also higher in PC3 tumors at 24 h. These data demonstrated that PET molecular imaging of EDB-FN in the tumor microenvironment of prostate cancer allows efficient differentiation of PC3 and LNCaP tumors in vivo.

CSCs are characterized by features that include self-renewal, pluripotency and tumorigenicity, and are thought to be solely responsible for tumor recurrence and metastasis. A hierarchically organized CSC model is becoming increasingly evident for various types of cancer, including prostate cancer. The CD44 (+), CD133 (+) cell subpopulations were isolated from human prostate tumors which exhibit stem-like properties showing therapeutic-resistance, capacity of self-renewal, and exact recapitulation of the original tumor in vivo. Thus, an important challenge is to find measures to eliminate these cancer stem cells, which will stop tumor growth and prevent disease-recurrence. However, knowledge about molecular features critical for the survival of prostate cancer stem cells (PCSC) is meager. Here we report that inhibition of 5-lipoxygenase (5-Lox) by shRNA or MK591 dramatically kills PCSC by inducing apoptosis, suggesting that 5-Lox plays an essential role in the survival of PCSC. Interestingly, MK591 treatment decreases protein levels and inhibits transcriptional activities of Nanog and c-Myc. Since Nanog and c-Myc play important roles as stemness factors, our findings indicate that the 5-Lox activity plays a causal role in maintaining prostate cancer stemness via regulation of Nanog and c-Myc, and suggest that further exploration of 5-Lox-mediated signaling in PCSC may lead to development of novel, target-based, durable strategies to effectively block development and growth of prostate tumors, and prevent prostate cancer recurrence.""","""['Sivalokanathan Sarveswaran', 'Nadimpalli R S Varma', 'Shravan Morisetty', 'Jagadananda Ghosh']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Oncotarget""","""['Pharmacological and genetic targeting of 5-lipoxygenase interrupts c-Myc oncogenic signaling and kills enzalutamide-resistant prostate cancer cells via apoptosis.', 'Inhibition of 5-lipoxygenase selectively triggers disruption of c-Myc signaling in prostate cancer cells.', 'MK591, a second generation leukotriene biosynthesis inhibitor, prevents invasion and induces apoptosis in the bone-invading C4-2B human prostate cancer cells: implications for the treatment of castration-resistant, bone-metastatic prostate cancer.', 'Resistance to Cell Death and Its Modulation in Cancer Stem Cells.', 'Activation of Matrix Hyaluronan-Mediated CD44 Signaling, Epigenetic Regulation and Chemoresistance in Head and Neck Cancer Stem Cells.', 'Interaction between prostate cancer stem cells and bone microenvironment regulates prostate cancer bone metastasis and treatment resistance.', 'Comparative Pathobiology of Canine and Human Prostate Cancer: State of the Art and Future Directions.', 'Targeting the eicosanoid pathway in hepatocellular carcinoma.', 'Repurposing antidepressant sertraline as a pharmacological drug to target prostate cancer stem cells: dual activation of apoptosis and autophagy signaling by deregulating redox balance.', 'A new treatment for severe pulmonary arterial hypertension based on an old idea: inhibition of 5-lipoxygenase.']"""

Melatonin (MLT) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) have properties to modulate both, but their protective role, mainly at early stages of prostate cancer, remains unclear. In this study, the effects of MLT and DHA, combined or not, on PNT1A cells with regard to mitochondria bioenergetics, ROS production, and proliferation-related pathways were examined. Based on dose response and lipid accumulation assays, DHA at 100 μM and MLT at 1 μM for 48 h were chosen. DHA doubled and MLT reduced (40%) superoxide anion production, but coincubation (DM) did not normalize to control. Hydrogen peroxide production decreased after MLT incubation only (p < 0.01). These alterations affected the area and perimeter of mitochondria, since DHA increased whereas MLT decreased, but such hormone has no effect on coincubation. DHA isolated did not change the oxidative phosphorylation rate (OXPHOS), but decreased (p < 0.001) the mitochondrial bioenergetic reserve capacity (MBRC) which is closely related to cell responsiveness to stress conditions. MLT, regardless of DHA, ameliorated OXPHOS and recovered MBRC after coincubation. All incubations decreased AKT phosphorylation; however, only MLT alone inhibited p-mTOR. MLT increased p-ERK1/2 and, when combined to DHA, increased GSTP1 expression (p < 0.01). DHA did not change the testosterone levels in the medium, whereas MLT alone or coincubated decreased by about 20%; however, any incubation affected AR expression. Moreover, incubation with luzindole revealed that MLT effects were MTR1/2-independent. In conclusion, DHA increased ROS production and impaired mitochondrial function which was probably related to AKT inactivation; MLT improved OXPHOS and decreased ROS which was related to AKT/mTOR dephosphorylation, and when coincubated, the antiproliferative action was related to mitochondrial bioenergetic modulation associated to AKT and ERK1/2 regulation. Together, these findings point to the potential application of DHA and MLT towards the prevention of proliferative prostate diseases.""","""['Guilherme H Tamarindo', 'Daniele L Ribeiro', 'Marina G Gobbo', 'Luiz H A Guerra', 'Paula Rahal', 'Sebastião R Taboga', 'Fernanda R Gadelha', 'Rejane M Góes']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Oxid Med Cell Longev""","""['Docosahexaenoic acid differentially modulates the cell cycle and metabolism- related genes in tumor and pre-malignant prostate cells.', 'The omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid DHA induces simultaneous apoptosis and autophagy via mitochondrial ROS-mediated Akt-mTOR signaling in prostate cancer cells expressing mutant p53.', 'Melatonin as a negative mitogenic hormonal regulator of human prostate epithelial cell growth: potential mechanisms and clinical significance.', 'Melatonin as a Pleiotropic Molecule with Therapeutic Potential for Type 2 Diabetes and Cancer.', 'Melatonin: A Potential Anti-Oxidant Therapeutic Agent for Mitochondrial Dysfunctions and Related Disorders.', 'Melatonin and Prostate Cancer: Anti-tumor Roles and Therapeutic Application.', 'Melatonin Attenuates Mitochondrial Damage in Aristolochic Acid-Induced Acute Kidney Injury.', 'Melatonin in Cancer Treatment: Current Knowledge and Future Opportunities.', 'Role and Therapeutic Potential of Melatonin in Various Type of Cancers.', 'The inhibitory effect of melatonin on human prostate cancer.']"""

We showed that fatty acid uptake was increased in human prostate cancer and that these fatty acids were directed toward biomass production. These changes were mediated, at least partly, by the fatty acid transporter CD36, which was associated with aggressive disease. Deleting Cd36 in the prostate of cancer-susceptible Pten-/- mice reduced fatty acid uptake and the abundance of oncogenic signaling lipids and slowed cancer progression. Moreover, CD36 antibody therapy reduced cancer severity in patient-derived xenografts. We further demonstrated cross-talk between fatty acid uptake and de novo lipogenesis and found that dual targeting of these pathways more potently inhibited proliferation of human cancer-derived organoids compared to the single treatments.

Materials and methods:   We evaluated physician use of orally administered cancer drugs for four cancers: prostate (abiraterone, enzalutamide), renal cell (axitinib, everolimus, pazopanib, sorafenib, sunitinib), lung (afatinib, erlotinib), and chronic myeloid leukemia (CML; dasatinib, imatinib, nilotinib). Separate physician cohorts were defined for each cancer type by prescribing history. The primary exposure was the number of calendar years during 2013-2015 in which a physician received payments from the manufacturer of one of the studied drugs; the outcome was relative prescribing of that drug in 2015, compared with the other drugs for that cancer. We evaluated whether practice setting at a National Cancer Institute (NCI)-designated Comprehensive Cancer Center, receipt of payments for purposes other than education or research (compensation payments), maximum annual dollar value received, and institutional conflict-of-interest policies were associated with the strength of the payment-prescribing association. We used modified Poisson regression to control confounding by other physician characteristics.  Results:   Physicians who received payments for a drug in all 3 years had increased prescribing of that drug (compared with 0 years), for renal cell (relative risk [RR] 1.81, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.58-2.07), CML (RR 1.22, 95% CI 1.08-1.39), and lung (RR 1.69, 95% CI 1.58-1.82), but not prostate (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.93-1.02). Physicians who received compensation payments or >$100 annually had increased prescribing compared with those who did not, but NCI setting and institutional conflict-of-interest policies were not consistently associated with the direction of prescribing change.  Conclusion:   The association between industry payments and cancer drug prescribing was greatest among physicians who received payments consistently (within each calendar year). Receipt of payments for compensation purposes, such as for consulting or travel, and higher dollar value of payments were also associated with increased prescribing.  Implications for practice:   Financial payments from pharmaceutical companies are common among oncologists. It is known from prior work that oncologists tend to prescribe more of the drugs made by companies that have given them money. By combining records of industry gifts with prescribing records, this study identifies the consistency of payments over time, the dollar value of payments, and payments for compensation as factors that may strengthen the association between receiving payments and increased prescribing of that company's drug.""","""['Aaron P Mitchell', 'Aaron N Winn', 'Jennifer L Lund', 'Stacie B Dusetzina']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Oncologist""","""['Distribution and Patterns of Industry-Related Payments to Oncologists in 2014.', 'Association between industry payments and prescribing costly medications: an observational study using open payments and medicare part D data.', 'The lack of a relationship between physician payments from drug manufacturers and Medicare claims for abiraterone and enzalutamide.', ""Interactions between physicians and the pharmaceutical industry generally and sales representatives specifically and their association with physicians' attitudes and prescribing habits: a systematic review."", 'Financial relationships in economic analyses of targeted therapies in oncology.', 'Interactions between Australian cancer physicians and the pharmaceutical industry: a qualitative study.', 'Pharmaceutical payments to Japanese board-certified dermatologists: a 4-year retrospective analysis of personal payments from pharmaceutical companies between 2016 and 2019.', 'Trends in Industry Payments to Physicians in the First 6 Years After Graduate Medical Training.', 'Increasing Financial Payments From Industry to Medical Oncologists in the United States, 2014-2017.', 'Interactions with the pharmaceutical industry and the practice, knowledge and beliefs of medical oncologists and clinical haematologists: a systematic review.']"""

Thus, novel and more accurate molecular biomarkers are required.  Methods:   Using reverse transcription quantitative PCR, we measured the concentrations of 45 preselected microRNAs (miRNAs) in extracellular vesicle-enriched cell-free urine samples from 4 independent patient cohorts from Spain and Denmark, including 758 patients with clinically localized PC, 289 noncancer controls with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), and 233 patients undergoing initial transrectal ultrasound (TRUS)-guided prostate biopsy owing to PC suspicion (101 with benign and 132 with malignant outcome). Diagnostic potential was assessed by ROC and decision curve analysis.  Results:   We identified and successfully validated 8 upregulated and 21 downregulated miRNAs in urine from PC patients. Furthermore, we validated a previously identified 3-miRNA diagnostic ratio model, uCaP (miR-222-3p*miR-24-3p/miR-30c-5p). High uCaP scores were distinctive of PC in urine samples from BPH vs PC patients in 3 independent cohorts [area under the curve (AUC) = 0.84, 0.71, 0.72]. Additionally, uCaP predicted TRUS biopsy results with greater accuracy than PSA (AUC uCaP = 0.644; AUC PSA = 0.527) for patients within the diagnostic gray zone (PSA ≤ 10 ng/mL).  Conclusions:   We successfully validated a urine-based diagnostic 3-miRNA signature for PC (uCaP) in 3 independent patient cohorts from 2 countries.

GSH and associated enzymes are controlled by a transcription factor-nuclear factor-2 related erythroid factor-2 (Nrf2). In cellular milieu, GSH protects the cells essentially against a wide variety of free radicals including reactive oxygen species, lipid hydroperoxides, xenobiotic toxicants, and heavy metals. It has two forms, the reduced form or reduced glutathione (GSH) and oxidized form (GSSG), where two GSH moieties combine by sulfhydryl bonds. Glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and glutathione-s-transferase (GST) essentially perform the detoxification reactions using GSH, converting it into GSSG. Glutathione reductase (GR) operates the salvage pathway by converting GSSG to GSH with the expense of NADPH and restores the cellular GSH pool. Hence, GSH and GSH-dependent enzymes are necessary for maintaining the normal redox balance in the body and help in cell survival under stress conditions. In addition, GST removes various carcinogenic compounds offering a chemopreventive property, whereas the GSH system plays a significant role in regulating the cellular survival by offering redox stability in a variety of cancers including prostate, lung, breast, and colon cancer. Studies have also indicated that GSH inhibitors, such as buthionine sulfoximine, improve the chemo-sensitivity in cancer cells.

This patient group reports a more negative impact of treatment than heterosexual men. Yet, gay men's experiences of post-treatment sexual changes are still little explored. This study aims to determine specific concerns of gay men's post-treatment sexual practices. Methods: A qualitative study design was deployed using semi-structured interviews as data. Participants were purposefully sampled through advertisements and the snowball method. Eleven self-identifying gay men aged 58-81 years and treated for prostate cancer participated in interviews during 2016-2017. The interviews were transcribed, coded and thematically analysed. Results: The analysis highlights sexual changes in relation to the physical body, identity and relations. Problematic physical changes included loss of ejaculate and erectile dysfunction. Some respondents reported continued pleasure from anal stimulation and were uncertain about the role of the prostate. These physical changes prompted reflections on age and (dis)ability. Relationship status also impacted perception of physical changes, with temporary sexual contacts demanding more of the men in terms of erection and ejaculations. Conclusions: Gay prostate cancer survivors' narratives about sexual changes circle around similar bodily changes as heterosexual men's, such as erectile problems and weaker orgasms. The loss of ejaculate was experienced as more debilitating for gay men. Men who had anal sex were concerned about penetration difficulties as well as sensations of anal stimulation. Additional studies are required to better understand the role of the prostate among a diversity of men, regardless of sexuality.""","""['Carina Danemalm Jägervall', 'Jelmer Brüggemann', 'Ericka Johnson']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Scand J Urol""","""[""Re: Gay Men's Experiences of Sexual Changes after Prostate Cancer Treatment-A Qualitative Study in Sweden."", 'Threat of Sexual Disqualification: The Consequences of Erectile Dysfunction and Other Sexual Changes for Gay and Bisexual Men With Prostate Cancer.', 'Impact of Prostate Cancer Treatment on the Sexual Quality of Life for Men-Who-Have-Sex-with-Men.', ""Gay men's experiences with prostate cancer: Implications for future research."", 'A qualitative metasynthesis exploring the impact of prostate cancer and its management on younger, unpartnered and gay men.', 'The ""Okay"" Gay Guys: Developing Hegemonic Sexuality as a Tool to Understand Men\'s Workplace Identities.', 'Sexual health and treatment-related sexual dysfunction in sexual and gender minorities with prostate cancer.', ""LGBTQI cancer patients' quality of life and distress: A comparison by gender, sexuality, age, cancer type and geographical remoteness."", 'Supportive care needs of men with prostate cancer: A systematic review update.', 'A Biopsychosocial Approach to Grief, Depression, and the Role of Emotional Regulation.', 'Health outcomes of sexual and gender minorities after cancer: a systematic review.']"""

The debate is ongoing whether robot-assisted radical prostatectomy can lower this risk compared to open surgery. The objective of the present study was to evaluate post-operative adverse events leading to readmissions, using clinical records to classify these adverse events systematically. Materials and methods: A prospective controlled trial of men who underwent robot-assisted laparoscopic (RALP) or retropubic radical prostatectomy (RRP) at 14 departments of Urology (LAPPRO) between 2008 and 2011. Data on all readmissions within 3 months of surgery were collected from the Patient registry, Swedish Board of Health and Welfare. For each readmission the highest Clavien-Dindo grade was listed. Results: A total of 4003 patients were included in the LAPPRO trial and, after applying exclusion criteria, 3706 patients remained for analyses. The results showed no statistically significant difference in the overall readmission rates (8.1 vs. 7.1%) or readmission due to major complications (Clavien-Dindo ≥3b, 1.7 vs. 1.9%) between RALP and RRP within 90 days after surgery. Patients subjected to lymph-node dissection (LND) had twice the risk for readmission as men not undergoing LND, irrespective RALP or RRP technique. Blood transfusion was significantly more frequent during and within 30 days of RRP surgery (16 vs. 4%). Abdominal symptoms were more common after RALP. Conclusions: There is a substantial risk for hospital readmission after prostate-cancer surgery, regardless of technique; although major complications are rare. Regardless of surgical technique, attention should be focused on specific types of complications.""","""['Anna Wallerstedt Lantz', 'Johan Stranne', 'Stavros I Tyritzis', 'David Bock', 'David Wallin', 'Hanna Nilsson', 'Stefan Carlsson', 'Thordis Thorsteinsdottir', 'Ove Gustafsson', 'Jonas Hugosson', 'Anders Bjartell', 'Peter Wiklund', 'Gunnar Steineck', 'Eva Haglind']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Scand J Urol""","""['Hospital readmissions after limited vs. extended lymph node dissection during open and robot-assisted radical prostatectomy.', 'Health Economic Analysis of Open and Robot-assisted Laparoscopic Surgery for Prostate Cancer Within the Prospective Multicentre LAPPRO Trial.', 'Comparison of 90-day re-admission rates between open retropubic radical prostatectomy (RRP), laparoscopic RP (LRP) and robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy (RALP).', 'Long-term comparative outcome analysis of a robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy with retropubic radical prostatectomy by a single surgeon.', 'Comparison of radical prostatectomy techniques: open, laparoscopic and robotic assisted.', 'Prostate Volume Influence on Postoperative Outcomes for Patients Undergoing RARP: A Monocentric Serial Analysis of 500 Cases.', ""American Society of Anesthesiologists' (ASA) Physical Status System and Risk of Major Clavien-Dindo Complications After Robot-Assisted Radical Prostatectomy at Hospital Discharge: Analysis of 1143 Consecutive Prostate Cancer Patients."", 'American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status system predicts the risk of postoperative Clavien-Dindo complications greater than one at 90\xa0days after robot-assisted radical prostatectomy: final results of a tertiary referral center.', 'Latest Comprehensive Medical Resource Consumption in Robot-Assisted versus Laparoscopic and Traditional Open Radical Prostatectomy: A Nationwide Population-Based Cohort Study.', 'A systematic review and meta-analysis of unplanned hospital visits and re-admissions following radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer.']"""

Patients and methods:   Consecutive patients with PCa treated with primary focal HIFU at two centres by six treating clinicians were assessed. Patients were submitted to either focal ablation or hemi-ablation using HIFU (Sonablate 500). The primary objective of the study was to assess medium-term oncological outcomes, defined as overall survival, freedom from biopsy failure, freedom from any further treatment and freedom from radical treatment after focal HIFU. The secondary objective was to evaluate the changes in pathological features among patients treated with focal HIFU over time. We also assessed the relationship between year of surgery and 5-year retreatment probability.  Results:   A total of 1032 men treated between November 2005 and October 2017 were assessed. The median age was 65 years and median prostate-specific antigen level was 7 ng/mL. The majority of patients had a Gleason score of 3 + 4 or above (80.3%). The median (interquartile range) follow-up was 36 (14-64) months. The overall survival rates at 24, 60 and 96 months were 99%, 97% and 97%, respectively. Freedom from biopsy failure, defined as absence of Gleason 3 + 4 disease, was 84%, 64% and 54% at 24, 60 and 96 months. Freedom from any further treatment was 85%, 59% and 46% at 24, 60 and 96 months, respectively. Approximately 70% of patients who were retreated received a second focal treatment. Freedom from radical treatment was 98%, 91% and 81% at 24, 60 and 96 months. During the study period, we observed an increase in the proportion of patients undergoing focal HIFU with Gleason 3 + 4 disease and with T2 stage disease as defined by multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging. Finally, there was a reduction over time in the proportion of patients undergoing re-treatment within 5 years of first treatment.  Conclusions:   Focal HIFU for PCa is a feasible therapeutic strategy, with acceptable survival and oncological results and a reduction in the 5-year retreatment rates over the last decade.

When studying time-varying exposure to metformin, covariates such as body mass index (BMI) and glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) may act as both confounders and causal pathway variables, and so cannot be handled adequately by standard regression methods. Marginal structural models (MSMs) with inverse probability of treatment weights (IPTW) can correctly adjust for such confounders. Using this approach, the main objective of this study was to estimate the effect of metformin on cancer risk compared with risk in patients with T2DM taking no medication.  Methods:   Patients with incident type 2 diabetes (T2DM) were identified in the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD), a database of electronic health records derived from primary care in the UK. Patients entered the study at diabetes diagnosis or the first point after this when they had valid HbA1c and BMI measurements, and follow-up was split into 1-month intervals. Logistic regression was used to calculate IPTW; then the effect of metformin on all cancers (including and excluding non-melanoma skin cancer) and breast, prostate, lung, colorectal and pancreatic cancers was estimated in the weighted population.  Results:   A total of 55 629 T2DM patients were alive and cancer-free at their study entry; 2530 people had incident cancer during a median follow-up time of 2.9 years [interquartile range (IQR) 1.3-5.4 years]. Using the MSM approach, the hazard ratio (HR) for all cancers, comparing treatment with metformin with no glucose-lowering treatment, was 1.02 (0.88-1.18). Results were robust to a range of sensitivity analyses and remained consistent when estimating the treatment effect by length of exposure. We also found no evidence of a protective effect of metformin on individual cancer outcomes.

This study investigated the association between ADT use and the development of depression, outpatient psychiatric services, inpatient psychiatric services, and suicide in a homogeneous group of men with prostate cancer (PC) treated with definitive radiation therapy (RT) after controlling for multiple sources of selection bias.  Methods:   This was a retrospective, observational cohort study of 39,965 veterans with PC who were treated with definitive RT and were diagnosed by the US Department of Veterans Affairs health care system between January 1, 2001, and October 31, 2015. Exposure was ADT initiation within 1 year of the PC diagnosis. The primary outcome was new development of depression. Secondary outcomes were outpatient psychiatric use, inpatient psychiatric use, and suicide.  Results:   During follow-up, 934 patients were newly diagnosed with depression, 7825 patients used outpatient psychiatric services, 358 patients used inpatient psychiatric services, and 54 patients committed suicide. In the multivariable competing risks regression model, ADT was associated with the development of depression (subdistribution hazard ratio [SHR], 1.50; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.32-1.71; P < .001). ADT was also associated with outpatient psychiatric utilization (SHR, 1.21; 95% CI, 1.16-1.27; P < .001). Finally, ADT was not associated with inpatient psychiatric utilization or suicide.  Conclusions:   An increase in the risk of depression and the use of outpatient psychiatric services was observed in a large cohort of men with PC who received ADT with definitive RT. These results may provide further evidence for the long-term risks of ADT for psychiatric health in the treatment of PC.""","""['Rishi Deka', 'Brent S Rose', 'Alex K Bryant', 'Reith R Sarkar', 'Vinit Nalawade', 'Rana McKay', 'James D Murphy', 'Daniel R Simpson']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Cancer""","""['Androgen deprivation therapy and depression in men with prostate cancer treated with definitive radiation therapy: A psychological perspective.', 'Cardiovascular disease risk and androgen deprivation therapy in patients with localised prostate cancer: a prospective cohort study.', 'Upfront androgen deprivation therapy with salvage radiation may improve biochemical outcomes in prostate cancer patients with post-prostatectomy rising PSA.', 'Androgen deprivation in men with prostate cancer is associated with an increased rate of bone loss.', 'Non-steroidal antiandrogen monotherapy compared with luteinising hormone-releasing hormone agonists or surgical castration monotherapy for advanced prostate cancer.', 'Total androgen blockade.', 'The role of testosterone, the androgen receptor, and hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis in depression in ageing Men.', 'Mental Health in Urologic Oncology.', 'Prostate Cancer and Sleep Disorders: A Systematic Review.', 'Depression, Anxiety, and Patterns of Mental Health Care Among Men With Prostate Cancer Receiving Androgen Deprivation Therapy.', 'Androgen deprivation therapy and acute kidney injury in patients with prostate cancer undergoing definitive radiotherapy.']"""

We assessed the relationship between surgical experience and oncologic outcomes of robot-assisted radical prostatectomy.  Materials and methods:   We analyzed the records of 1,827 patients in whom prostate cancer was treated with robot-assisted radical prostatectomy. Surgical experience was coded as the total number of robotic prostatectomies performed by the surgeon before the patient operation. We evaluated the relationship of prior surgeon experience to the probability of positive margins and biochemical recurrence in regression models adjusting for stage, grade and prostate specific antigen.  Results:   After adjusting for case mix, greater surgeon experience was associated with a lower probability of positive surgical margins (p = 0.035). The risk of positive margins decreased from 16.7% to 9.6% in patients treated by a surgeon with 10 and 250 prior procedures, respectively (risk difference 7.1%, 95% CI 1.7-12.2). In patients with nonorgan confined disease the predicted probability of positive margins was 38.4% in those treated by surgeons with 10 prior operations and 24.9% in those treated by surgeons with 250 prior operations (absolute risk reduction 13.5%, 95% CI -3.4-22.5). The relationship between surgical experience and the risk of biochemical recurrence after surgery was not significant (p = 0.8).  Conclusions:   Specific techniques used by experienced surgeons which are associated with improved margin rates need further research.

However, little is known about its role in the progression of prostate cancer. The aim of the present study was to examine the expression and potential role of KLF4 in prostate cancer. KLF4 and E‑cadherin expression in 60 prostate cancer tissues and 60 benign prostatic hyperplasia tissues was characterized by immunohistochemistry. The levels of KLF4 expression in prostate cancer cells were determined by reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blot analysis. LNCaP cells were transduced with lentivirus to induce KLF4 overexpression. The effects of KLF4 overexpression on proliferation, cell cycle and migration were determined by MTT, flow cytometry, wound healing and Transwell migration assays. KLF4 was identified to be primarily expressed in the cytoplasm of non‑tumor prostate tissues. The percentage of KLF4+ tissues among prostate cancer tissues (16.67%) was significantly lower compared with that of non‑tumor tissues (84.67%; P<0.05). Downregulated KLF4 expression was associated with higher stage, positive lymph node metastasis and higher Gleason scores of prostate cancer (all P<0.05). Induction of KLF4 overexpression significantly inhibited the proliferation, wound healing and migration of LNCaP cells and induced their cell cycle arrest at S phase. Furthermore, E‑cadherin expression was downregulated in prostate cancer tissues and KLF4 overexpression enhanced the levels of E‑cadherin expression in LNCaP cells. In conclusion, downregulated KLF4 expression was associated with aggressiveness of prostate cancer, and KLF4 overexpression inhibited the proliferation, wound healing and migration of prostate cancer cells by inducing cell cycle arrest and E‑cadherin expression.""","""['Neng Zhang', 'Peng Su', 'Xiaoguang Li', 'Jianming Xi', 'Xu Li', 'Luo Xu']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Oncol Rep""","""['Recent Discoveries on the Involvement of Krüppel-Like Factor 4 in the Most Common Cancer Types.', 'Identification of endonuclease domain-containing 1 as a novel tumor suppressor in prostate cancer.', 'Prognostic value and function of KLF4 in prostate cancer: RNAa and vector-mediated overexpression identify KLF4 as an inhibitor of tumor cell growth and migration.', 'miR-375 exhibits a more effective tumor-suppressor function in laryngeal squamous carcinoma cells by regulating KLF4 expression compared with simple co-transfection of miR-375 and miR-206.', 'KLF4, p21 and context-dependent opposing forces in cancer.', 'KLF4 transcription factor in tumorigenesis.', 'Krüppel-like factors in tumors: Key regulators and therapeutic avenues.', 'Muscle and Bone Defects in Metastatic Disease.', 'Recent Discoveries on the Involvement of Krüppel-Like Factor 4 in the Most Common Cancer Types.']"""

Activation of HIF1α under hypoxia condition is able to regulate the expression of glycolysis-related genes, and results in the proliferation and metastasis of cancer cells. However, the mechanism underlying HIF1α activation and glycolysis induction by hypoxia remains unclear. The present study is aimed to test if SENP1 regulates the glycolysis of prostate cancer cells (CaP) by improving stability of HIF1α protein. Methods: We employed qPCR and western blotting assay to analyze expression of HIF1α and SENP1. Glucose uptake assay, lactate production assay, LDH release assay and ATP production assay were utilized to evaluate cell glycolysis. The interaction between SENP1 and HIF1α was verified by co-immunoprecipitation assay. Results: We found that hypoxia condition improves glucose uptake and lactate production to sustain sufficient ATP for cellular activity in prostatic carcinoma cells. The expression of SENP1 mRNA was significantly increased in human prostatic carcinoma cell lines after exposure to hypoxia, accompanied by the up-regulation of HIF1α. Furthermore, forced expression of SENP1 was shown to regulate the glycolysis in prostatic carcinoma cells by stabilizing HIF1α. The up-regulation of SENP1 promotes tumor cell proliferation and tumorgenesis by interacting with HIF1α which was deSUMOylated and sequentially leading to a ""Warburg effect"".

Here we show evidence for the correlation in angiogenesis. First, silencing of each protein by siRNA-mediated knockdown in mouse endothelial MSS31 cells resulted in the inhibition of tube formation. Unexpectedly, the knockdown of MTA1 affected not only its own expression but also the expression of S100A4, whereas silencing of S100A4 did not affect the MTA1 expression. Additionally, non-muscle myosin IIA (NMIIA) phosphorylation, which was partly controlled by S100A4, was found to be upregulated by knockdown of both proteins in MSS31 cells. Moreover, cycloheximide treatment of MSS31 cells revealed that the rate of S100A4 degradation was accelerated by MTA1 knockdown. This finding, together with our observation that cytoplasmic MTA1, but not nuclear MTA1, was colocalized with S100A4, suggested the involvement of MTA1 in S100A4 stability. The direct in vivo angiogenesis assay showed that both protein siRNAs provoked a significant inhibition of new blood vessel formation induced by angiogenic factors, indicating their anti-angiogenic activities. Treatment of human pancreatic tumor (PANC-1) xenograft in mice with mMTA1 siRNA resulted in tumor regression via suppression of angiogenesis in vivo, as also observed in the case of human prostate cancer xenograft treated with mS100A4 siRNA. Taken together, these data led us to conclude that the MTA1-S100A4-NMIIA axis exists in endothelial cells as a novel pathway in promoting tumor vascular formation and could be a target for suppressing tumor growth and metastasis.""","""['Mizuho Ishikawa', 'Mitsuhiko Osaki', 'Makoto Yamagishi', 'Kunishige Onuma', 'Hisao Ito', 'Futoshi Okada', 'Hideya Endo']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Oncogene""","""['MTA1, a metastasis‑associated protein, in endothelial cells is an essential molecule for angiogenesis.', 'Silencing of S100A4, a metastasis-associated protein, in endothelial cells inhibits tumor angiogenesis and growth.', 'Metastasis-Associated 1 (MTA1) Gene Expression Promotes Angiogenesis in Mouse Xenografts from Human Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) Cells.', 'MTA family of proteins in prostate cancer: biology, significance, and therapeutic opportunities.', 'Role of MTA1 in cancer progression and metastasis.', 'Stanniocalcin 1 promotes lung metastasis of breast cancer by enhancing EGFR-ERK-S100A4 signaling.', 'Tumor-Targeting Extracellular Vesicles Loaded with siS100A4 for Suppressing Postoperative Breast Cancer Metastasis.', 'A Simplified and Effective Approach for the Isolation of Small Pluripotent Stem Cells Derived from Human Peripheral Blood.', 'Exosome-transmitted S100A4 induces immunosuppression and non-small cell lung cancer development by activating STAT3.', 'MTA1, a metastasis‑associated protein, in endothelial cells is an essential molecule for angiogenesis.']"""

This diagnostic paradigm, while the standard of care, is time-consuming, shows intraobserver variability, and provides no information about the altered metabolic pathways, which result in altered tissue architecture. Characterization of the molecular composition of prostate cancer and how it changes with respect to the Gleason score (GS) could enable a more objective and faster diagnosis. It may also aid in our understanding of disease onset and progression. In this work, we present mass spectrometry imaging for identification and mapping of lipids and metabolites in prostate tissue from patients with known prostate cancer with GS from 6 to 9. A gradient of changes in the intensity of various lipids was observed, which correlated with increasing GS. Interestingly, these changes were identified in both regions of high tumor cell density, and in regions of tissue that appeared histologically benign, possibly suggestive of precancerous metabolomic changes.

When prostate cancer acquires castration resistance, incurable metastases, primarily in the bone, occur. The aim of this study is to test the applicability of targeting melanoma cell adhesion molecule (MCAM; CD146) with a mAb for the treatment of lytic prostate cancer bone metastasis. We evaluated the effect of targeting MCAM using in vivo preclinical bone metastasis models and an in vitro bone niche coculture system. We utilized FACS, cell proliferation assays, and gene expression profiling to study the phenotype and function of MCAM knockdown in vitro and in vivo. To demonstrate the impact of MCAM targeting and therapeutic applicability, we employed an anti-MCAM mAb in vivo. MCAM is elevated in prostate cancer metastases resistant to androgen ablation. Treatment with DHT showed MCAM upregulation upon castration. We investigated the function of MCAM in a direct coculture model of human prostate cancer cells with human osteoblasts and found that there is a reduced influence of human osteoblasts on human prostate cancer cells in which MCAM has been knocked down. Furthermore, we observed a strongly reduced formation of osteolytic lesions upon bone inoculation of MCAM-depleted human prostate cancer cells in animal model of prostate cancer bone metastasis. This phenotype is supported by RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis. Importantly, in vivo administration of an anti-MCAM human mAb reduced the tumor growth and lytic lesions. These results highlight the functional role for MCAM in the development of lytic bone metastasis and suggest that MCAM is a potential therapeutic target in prostate cancer bone metastasis.

Clinical guidelines for side effect management exist; however, these are not always integrated into routine practice. What remains undocumented and therefore the objective of this study, is to describe patients' willingness to employ established strategies.  Patients and methods:   Study participants were 91 men who had attended an educational program (ie, attend a class plus read a book), designed to prepare patients for managing ADT side effects. Three months later, patients completed the ADT Management Strategies Inventory, to determine use of strategies. Descriptive analyses were conducted.  Results:   At the time of class attendance, the average ADT duration was 133 days. Patient preferences for a variety of strategies for each side effect are presented. Highlights include: a high degree (> 65%) of patients using or willing to use exercise to manage medical risks and physical side effects. Forty percent of patients continued to engage in non-penetrative sexual activities, despite reduced sexual desire and erectile dysfunction.  Conclusions:   When educated about options, patients are willing to use a wide array of ADT management strategies. Consequently, health care providers should ensure that patients know about side effects and how to manage them. Exercise appears to be the single best strategy to encourage, because it is helpful in managing many side effects (eg, weight gain, muscle weakening, fatigue) and reducing medical risks of ADT (eg, cardiovascular disease, type II diabetes, and osteoporosis).

We aimed to establish the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic profile, and antitumour activity of tisotumab vedotin in a mixed population of patients with locally advanced or metastatic (or both) solid tumours known to express tissue factor.  Methods:   InnovaTV 201 is a phase 1-2, open-label, dose-escalation and dose-expansion study done at 21 centres in the USA and Europe. Patients (aged ≥18 years) had relapsed, advanced, or metastatic cancer of the ovary, cervix, endometrium, bladder, prostate, oesophagus, squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck or non-small-cell lung cancer; an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0-1; and had relapsed after or were not eligible to receive the available standard of care. No specific tissue factor expression level was required for inclusion. In the dose-escalation phase, patients were treated with tisotumab vedotin between 0·3 and 2·2 mg/kg intravenously once every 3 weeks in a traditional 3 + 3 design. In the dose-expansion phase, patients were treated at the recommended phase 2 dose. The primary endpoint was the incidence of adverse events, including serious adverse events, infusion-related, treatment-related and those of grade 3 or worse, and study drug-related adverse events, analysed in all patients who received at least one dose of tisotumab vedotin (full analysis population). This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02001623, and is closed to new participants with follow-up ongoing.  Findings:   Between Dec 9, 2013, and May 18, 2015, 27 eligible patients were enrolled to the dose-escalation phase. Dose-limiting toxicities, including grade 3 type 2 diabetes mellitus, mucositis, and neutropenic fever, were seen at the 2·2 mg/kg dose; therefore, 2·0 mg/kg of tisotumab vedotin intravenously once every 3 weeks was established as the recommended phase 2 dose. Between Oct 8, 2015, and April 26, 2018, 147 eligible patients were enrolled to the dose-expansion phase. The most common (in ≥20% of patients) treatment-emergent adverse events of any grade were epistaxis (102 [69%] of 147 patients), fatigue (82 [56%]), nausea (77 [52%]), alopecia (64 [44%]), conjunctivitis (63 [43%]), decreased appetite (53 [36%]), constipation (52 [35%]), diarrhoea (44 [30%]), vomiting (42 [29%]), peripheral neuropathy (33 [22%]), dry eye (32 [22%]), and abdominal pain (30 [20%]). The most common adverse events of grade 3 or worse were fatigue (14 [10%] of 147 patients), anaemia (eight [5%]), abdominal pain (six [4%]), hypokalaemia (six [4%]), conjunctivitis (five [3%]), hyponatraemia (five [3%]), and vomiting (five [3%]). 67 (46%) of 147 patients had a treatment-emergent serious adverse event. 39 (27%) of 147 patients had a treatment-emergent serious adverse event related to the study drug. Infusion-related reactions occurred in 17 (12%) of 147 patients. Across tumour types, the confirmed proportion of patients who achieved an objective response was 15·6% (95% CI 10·2-22·5; 23 of 147 patients). There were nine deaths across all study phases (three in the dose-escalation phase and six in the dose-expansion phase); only one case of pneumonia in the dose-expansion phase was considered possibly related to study treatment.  Interpretations:   Tisotumab vedotin has a manageable safety profile with encouraging preliminary antitumour activity across multiple tumour types in heavily pretreated patients.

Due to the difficulty with obtaining tumor tissue in bony metastases, liquid biopsies are a promising alternative to guide treatment selection. While concurrent tissue next-generation sequencing (tNGS) and liquid biopsy has high concordance, it is unknown whether the genomic landscape of metastatic prostate cancer (mPC) changes over time or treatment. Herein, we hypothesize that the genomic landscape of mPC evolves with new treatments and/or time between tests.  Patients and methods:   Men with mPC from the University of Utah with matched tNGS and liquid biopsy were included. Clinical data was collected retrospectively. Exonic regions from 69 genes covered by both platforms were included for analysis. Paired t tests were used to assess number of genomic alterations (GAs) between testing platforms. Number of alterations was assessed by time and number of treatments between testing by multivariate nonparametric trend tests.  Results:   101 men with mPC were eligible and included. In men with no new treatments and ≤ 1 year between tests, a similar number of GAs were detected in both tests (2.0 vs. 2.2). In contrast, men with ≥ 1 new treatment between tests had significantly more GAs after treatment (5.0 vs. 2.4, p = 0.005). Total number of GAs was correlated with number of new treatments between testing (p = 0.003) and not time between testing (p = 0.76).  Conclusion:   The genomic landscape of mPC evolves with subsequent therapies.

The Prostate Cancer UK Expert Reference Group (ERG) on AS was then convened to discuss and refine the statement.  Results:   Guidelines and protocols for AS varied significantly in terms of risk stratification, criteria for offering AS, and protocols for AS between and within countries. Patients and healthcare professionals identified clinical, emotional and process needs for AS to be effective. Men with prostate cancer wanted more information and psychological support at the time of discussing AS with the treating team and in the first 2 years of AS, and a named healthcare professional to discuss any questions or concerns they had. The ERG agreed 30 consensus statements regarding best practice for AS. Statements were grouped under headings: 'Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria'; 'AS follow-up protocol' and 'When to stop AS'.  Conclusion:   Significant variation currently exists in the practice of AS in the UK and internationally.

Results::   We examined 377 episodes of care, pertaining to 210 patients, that took place within our health system from January 2012 to June 2015. Ninety-six percent of episodes were assigned to clinically meaningful dyads. Excessive expenses were seen in metastatic, castration-resistant dyads containing second-line hormone therapy (ratio of observed to expected expenses [O/E], 2.66), chemotherapy (O/E, 2.09), and radium-223/sipuleucel-T (O/E, 3.01). An OCM update correcting for castration-resistant prostate cancer led to small differences in observed expenses (0% to +2%) but large changes in expected expenses (-17% to -27% for hormone-sensitive dyads and +136% to +141% for castration-resistant dyads). O/E increased up to 38% for hormone-sensitive dyads and decreased up to 58% for castration-resistant dyads. Emergency department and hospital utilization seems to drive cost for castration-resistant dyads but not for hormone-sensitive dyads. In the revised OCM model, overall O/E for all episodes improved by 22%, from 1.48 to 1.15.  Conclusion::   Our experience with OCM highlights the limitations of administrative claims data within this model and illustrates a method of translating these data into clinically meaningful information to improve value.""","""['Ronald D Ennis', 'Anish B Parikh', 'Mark Sanderson', 'Mark Liu', 'Luis Isola']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""J Oncol Pract""","""['Early Findings From the Oncology Care Model Evaluation.', 'Share of Oncology Versus Nononcology Spending in Episodes Defined by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Oncology Care Model.', 'Impact of the Oncology Care Model on Use of Supportive Care Medications During Cancer Treatment.', 'Update on Systemic Prostate Cancer Therapies: Management of Metastatic Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer in the Era of Precision Oncology.', 'Targeting Metastatic Hormone Sensitive Prostate Cancer: Chemohormonal Therapy and New Combinatorial Approaches.', 'Significant financial differences of chemical and surgical androgen deprivation in a contemporary cohort.', 'Identifying and understanding determinants of high healthcare costs for breast cancer: a quantile regression machine learning approach.', 'Associations of multimorbidity and patient-reported experiences of care with conservative management among elderly patients with localized prostate cancer.', 'Evaluation of Practice Patterns Among Oncologists Participating in the Oncology Care Model.', 'Comparison of statistical and machine learning models for healthcare cost data: a simulation study motivated by Oncology Care Model (OCM) data.']"""

The etiology of UI after prostatectomy is multifactorial and can be caused by both urethral sphincter deficiency and bladder dysfunction. To date, there are no comparative studies of the development of UI in patients after either organ-preserving treatment or radical prostatectomy (RP). Considering this fact, our aim was to carry out the comparative assessment of urodynamic changes in these categories of patients.  Materials and methods:   A retrospective study (n=158) was conducted. All patients were divided into three groups, depending on the method of treatment, HIFU (Group 1, n=32), retropubic RP (Group 2, n=46); robot-assisted RP (Group 3, n=80). The mean age was 71.8+/-3.68, 69.5+/-4.63 and 65.8+/-3.4 years in Group 1, 2 and 3, respectively (p<0.01). The average score was ICIQ-SF-14 points. The median follow-up was 2.7 years. In all cases a multi-channel urodynamics study in accordance with ICS standards was performed.  Results:   Detrusor overactivity (DO) was detected in 22 (68.7%), 24 (52.1%) and 64 (80%) patients in Group 1, 2 and 3, respectively (p<0.001). In 14% of patients with DO (18%, 12% and 12% Group 1, 2 and 3, p<0.05), leakage test with stress provocative maneuver was negative. The decrease in the bladder compliancy was revealed in 75.9% of patients, and in 8.8% cases (n=14) it was associated with anatomical changes (12.5%, 8.6% and 7.5% in Group 1, 2 and 3, respectively, p<0.01). The mean maximum detrusor pressure was reduced in all patients. Bladder outlet obstruction was detected in 46.6%, 21.7% and 12.5% cases (p<0.001). There was no significant difference in the level of maximum urethral pressure in all groups, but it was significant in patients with negative breakdown at the threshold of abdominal pressure and DO (p<0.05, k=0.87).  Conclusion:   The high incidence of postoperative bladder dysfunction in patients of the studied groups revealed by us differs from the existing literature data, which dictates the need for a detailed assessment of bladder dysfunction when choosing a tactic for treating UI. In connection with the above, we consider it necessary to conduct further studies with a mandatory pre- and postoperative urodynamic assessment of the lower urinary tract in patients after surgical treatment of prostate cancer without UI.""","""['I A Aboyan', 'V E Aboyan', 'Yu N Orlov', 'S M Pakus', 'D I Pakus']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Urologiia""","""['Urodynamic assessment of bladder and urethral function among men with lower urinary tract symptoms after radical prostatectomy: A comparison between men with and without urinary incontinence.', 'Correlation between symptoms and urodynamic results in patients with urinary incontinence after radical prostatectomy..', 'Lack of association between the ICIQ-SF questionnaire and the urodynamic diagnosis in men with post radical prostatectomy incontinence.', 'The etiology of post-radical prostatectomy incontinence and correlation of symptoms with urodynamic findings.', 'Voiding dysfunction after radical retropubic prostatectomy: more than external urethral sphincter deficiency.']"""

The heterogeneous structure of the tumor mass includes cancer stem cells that are responsible for tumor relapse, treatment resistance, invasion and metastasis. The biology of these cells is still not fully understood; therefore, effective treatments cannot be developed sufficiently. Herein, attenuated total reflection-Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy, combined with unsupervised multivariate analysis, was applied to prostate cancer stem cells (CSCs), non-stem cancer cells (non-CSCs) and normal prostate epithelial cells to elucidate the molecular mechanisms and features of CSCs, which are crucial to improving the target specific therapies. This work revealed the spectral differences in the cellular mechanisms and biochemical structures among three different cell types. Particularly, prostate CSCs exhibit differences in the lipid composition and dynamics when compared to other cell types. CSCs also harbor pronounced differences in their major cellular macromolecules, including differences in the protein amount and content (mainly α-helices), the abundance of nucleic acids (DNA/RNA), altered nucleic acid conformation and carbohydrate composition. Interestingly, macromolecules containing the C[double bond, length as m-dash]O groups and negatively charged molecules having the COO- groups are abundant in prostate CSCs in comparison to prostate non-CSCs and normal prostate cells. Overall, this study demonstrates the potential use of ATR-FTIR spectroscopy as a powerful tool to obtain new insights into the understanding of the CSC features, which may provide new strategies for cancer treatment by selectively targeting the CSCs.""","""['Günnur Güler', 'Ummu Guven', 'Gulperi Oktem']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Analyst""","""['CD133+/CD44+ prostate cancer stem cells exhibit embryo-like behavior patterns.', 'Sonic hedgehog signaling is associated with resistance to zoledronic acid in CD133high/CD44high prostate cancer stem cells.', 'Co-Expression of Putative Cancer Stem Cell Markers CD44 and CD133 in Prostate Carcinomas.', 'Prostate cancer stem cells: from theory to practice.', 'Potential mechanisms of CD133 in cancer stem cells.', 'Palmitate-Induced Cardiac Lipotoxicity Is Relieved by the Redox-Active Motif of SELENOT through Improving Mitochondrial Function and Regulating Metabolic State.', 'ATR-FTIR spectroscopy of plasma supported by multivariate analysis discriminates multiple sclerosis disease.', 'Plasma versus Serum Analysis by FTIR Spectroscopy to Capture the Human Physiological State.', 'Vibrational Biospectroscopy: An Alternative Approach to Endometrial Cancer Diagnosis and Screening.', 'Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) Spectroscopy to Analyse Human Blood over the Last 20 Years: A Review towards Lab-on-a-Chip Devices.']"""

The ability to induce and regulate the pathways that sustain these characteristic hallmarks of lethal cancers in a novel in vitro model would greatly enhance our understanding of cancer progression and treatment resistance. In this work, we present such a model, based simply on applying standard pluripotency/embryonic stem cell media alone. Core pluripotency stem cell master regulators (OCT4, SOX2 and NANOG) along with epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers (Snail, Slug, vimentin and N-cadherin) were induced in human prostate, breast, lung, bladder, colorectal, and renal cancer cells. RNA sequencing revealed pathways activated by pluripotency inducing culture that were shared across all cancers examined. These pathways highlight a potential core mechanism of treatment resistance. With a focus on prostate cancer, the culture-based induction of core pluripotent stem cell regulators was shown to promote survival in castrate conditions-mimicking first line treatment resistance with hormonal therapies. This acquired phenotype was shown to be mediated through the upregulation of iodothyronine deiodinase DIO2, a critical modulator of the thyroid hormone signalling pathway. Subsequent inhibition of DIO2 was shown to supress expression of prostate specific antigen, the cardinal clinical biomarker of prostate cancer progression and highlighted a novel target for clinical translation in this otherwise fatal disease.

Nuclear-cytoplasmic transport of oncogenic factors is mediated by Karyopherin proteins during cell transformation. However, the role of nuclear transporter proteins in PCa progression has not been well defined. Here, we report that the KPNB1, a key member of Karyopherin beta subunits, is highly expressed in advanced prostate cancers. Further study showed that targeting KPNB1 suppressed the proliferation of prostate cancer cells. The knockdown of KPNB1 reduced nuclear translocation of c-Myc, the expression of downstream cell cycle modulators, and phosphorylation of regulator of chromatin condensation 1 (RCC1), a key protein for spindle assembly during mitosis. Meanwhile, CHIP assay demonstrated the binding of c-Myc to KPNB1 promoter region, which indicated a positive feedback regulation of KPNB1 expression mediated by the c-Myc. In addition, NF-κB subunit p50 translocation to nuclei was blocked by KPNB1 inhibition, which led to an increase in apoptosis and a decrease in tumor sphere formation of PCa cells. Furthermore, subcutaneous xenograft tumor models with a stable knockdown of KPNB1 in C42B PCa cells validated that the inhibition of KPNB1 could suppress the growth of prostate tumor in vivo. Moreover, the intravenously administration of importazole, a specific inhibitor for KPNB1, effectively reduced PCa tumor size and weight in mice inoculated with PC3 PCa cells. In summary, our data established the functional link between KPNB1 and PCa prone c-Myc, NF-kB, and cell cycle modulators. More importantly, inhibition of KPNB1 could be a new therapeutic target for PCa treatment.""","""['Jian Yang', 'Yuqi Guo', 'Cuijie Lu', 'Ruohan Zhang', 'Yaoyu Wang', 'Liang Luo', 'Yanli Zhang', 'Catherine H Chu', 'Katherine J Wang', 'Sabrine Obbad', 'Wenbo Yan', 'Xin Li']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Oncogene""","""['Antitumor effects of pharmacological EZH2 inhibition on malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor through the miR-30a and KPNB1 pathway.', 'Karyopherin β1 deletion suppresses tumor growth and metastasis in colorectal cancer (CRC) by reducing MET expression.', 'Targeting KPNB1 overcomes TRAIL resistance by regulating DR5, Mcl-1 and FLIP in glioblastoma cells.', 'KPNB1 Inhibitor Importazole Reduces Ionizing Radiation-Increased Cell Surface PD-L1 Expression by Modulating Expression and Nuclear Import of IRF1.', 'KPNB1-mediated nuclear import is required for motility and inflammatory transcription factor activity in cervical cancer cells.', 'SFPQ promotes the proliferation, migration and invasion of hepatocellular carcinoma cells and is associated with poor prognosis.', 'Therapeutic targeting of CNBP phase separation inhibits ribosome biogenesis and neuroblastoma progression via modulating SWI/SNF complex activity.', 'MicroRNA-130a-3p impedes the progression of papillary thyroid carcinoma through downregulation of KPNB1 by targeting PSME3.', 'A mass spectrometry-based approach for the identification of Kpnβ1 binding partners in cancer cells.', 'Identification of pyroptosis-related lncRNA signature and AC005253.1 as a pyroptosis-related oncogene in prostate cancer.']"""

Interfering with the molecular machinery by which AR drives CaP progression may be an alternative therapeutic strategy but its feasibility remains to be tested. Here, we explore targeting the mechanism by which AR, via RhoA, conveys androgen-responsiveness to serum response factor (SRF), which controls aggressive CaP behavior and is maintained in CR-CaP. Following a siRNA screen and candidate gene approach, RNA-Seq studies confirmed that the RhoA effector Protein Kinase N1 (PKN1) transduces androgen-responsiveness to SRF. Androgen treatment induced SRF-PKN1 interaction, and PKN1 knockdown or overexpression severely impaired or stimulated, respectively, androgen regulation of SRF target genes. PKN1 overexpression occurred during clinical CR-CaP progression, and hastened CaP growth and shortened CR-CaP survival in orthotopic CaP xenografts. PKN1's effects on SRF relied on its kinase domain. The multikinase inhibitor lestaurtinib inhibited PKN1 action and preferentially affected androgen regulation of SRF over direct AR target genes. In a CR-CaP patient-derived xenograft, expression of SRF target genes was maintained while AR target gene expression declined and proliferative gene expression increased. PKN1 inhibition decreased viability of CaP cells before and after ADT. In patient-derived CaP explants, lestaurtinib increased AR target gene expression but did not significantly alter SRF target gene or proliferative gene expression.

Materials and methods:   A total of 382 patients underwent a posttreatment biopsy after external beam radiotherapy for clinically localized prostate cancer. Posttreatment biopsies were classified as positive (prostatic adenocarcinoma without typical radiation induced changes), negative (no evidence of carcinoma) or adenocarcinoma with a severe treatment effect. Median followup in survivors was 9 years. Competing risks regression was used to assess relationships between prognostic predictors and cause specific mortality, distant metastasis and prostate specific antigen failure.  Results:   The prevalence of positive biopsy, treatment effect and negative biopsy was 30%, 22% and 48%, respectively. Androgen deprivation therapy omission and high risk disease were associated with a 2.6 and 1.8-fold increase, respectively, in the odds of positive posttreatment biopsy. The 15-year PSA relapse rate associated with negative, severe treatment effect and positive posttreatment biopsies was 34%, 36% and 79%, respectively (p <0.001). After controlling for known predictors the risk of distant metastasis was 2.6-fold higher in patients with a positive biopsy (p <0.001) and cause specific mortality was twice as high in patients with a positive biopsy compared to those with negative and severe treatment effect biopsy outcomes (HR 2.00, p = 0.022).  Conclusions:   A positive posttreatment biopsy after external beam radiotherapy was associated with a higher risk of distant metastasis and prostate cancer related death. Patients with severe treatment effect classified biopsies have biological characteristics more like patients with a negative biopsy than a positive biopsy. Posttreatment biopsies were more often positive in the setting of external beam radiotherapy alone without androgen deprivation therapy or in the presence of high risk disease.""","""['Michael J Zelefsky', 'Debra A Goldman', 'Victor Reuter', 'Marisa Kollmeier', 'Sean McBride', 'Zhigang Zhang', 'Melissa Varghese', 'Xin Pei', 'Zvi Fuks']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""J Urol""","""['Editorial Comment.', 'Influence of local tumor control on distant metastases and cancer related mortality after external beam radiotherapy for prostate cancer.', 'Impact of Cribriform Pattern and Intraductal Carcinoma on Gleason 7 Prostate Cancer Treated with External Beam Radiotherapy.', 'Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA) Bounce After Dose-Escalated External Beam Radiation Therapy Is an Independent Predictor of PSA Recurrence, Metastasis, and Survival in Prostate Adenocarcinoma Patients.', 'Ten-year disease free survival after transperineal sonography-guided iodine-125 brachytherapy with or without 45-gray external beam irradiation in the treatment of patients with clinically localized, low to high Gleason grade prostate carcinoma.', 'Clinical and biological surveillance after radiotherapy for localized prostate cancer.', 'Has the Landscape of Immunotherapy for Prostate Cancer Changed?

However, no studies have compared enzalutamide without AAT with enzalutamide after AAT with flutamide as treatment for castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). We aimed to compare the efficacies of flutamide and enzalutamide for CRPC.  Methods:   In our hospital, 55 patients were diagnosed with CRPC after CAB therapy and administered flutamide or enzalutamide between May 2014 and December 2017. Patients with flutamide failure were administered enzalutamide. We evaluated the (1) prostate-specific antigen (PSA) best response with initial therapy, (2) PSA progression-free survival with initial therapy (PSA-PFS), (3) PSA best response with enzalutamide therapy, (4) PSA-PFS of enzalutamide therapy, and (5) overall survival (OS).  Results:   As first-line therapy, patients were administered enzalutamide (n = 29) or flutamide (n = 26). In the flutamide group, 18 patients showed disease progression and were administered enzalutamide. PSA best response was statistically higher in the enzalutamide group. PSA-PFS was significantly longer in the enzalutamide group [hazard ratio (HR) 0.42, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.19-0.92, p = 0.024]. However, there was no significant difference in PSA best response with enzalutamide therapy and PSA-PFS between the first- and second-line enzalutamide therapies (HR 0.80, 95% CI 0.33-1.94, p = 0.62). There was no significant difference in OS between enzalutamide and flutamide groups (HR 1.85, 95% CI 0.53-6.42, p = 0.33).

Previous studies have shown that microRNAs are downregulated in prostate cancer. This study aimed to investigate the role of microRNA-205 and microRNA-338-3p and cell apoptosis in prostate carcinoma tissue and the LNCaP human prostate adenocarcinoma cell line by directly targeting the BCL2 gene and Bcl-2 protein expression. MATERIAL AND METHODS Bioinformatics methods predicted the target genes of miR-205 and miR-338-3p, which were validated by a luciferase assay. Immunohistochemistry was used to detect Bcl-2 protein expression in 30 samples of prostate carcinoma tissue and 30 matched samples of normal prostate. The normal prostate epithelial cell line, RWPE-1, and LNCaP human prostate adenocarcinoma cells studied in vitro. BCL2 mRNA expression and Bcl-2 protein expression were determined by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (q-PCR) and Western blot, respectively. Cell apoptosis was measured by flow cytometry using annexin V, fluorescein isothiocyanate, and phycoerythrin (annexin V-FITC/PE). RESULTS TargetScan Human 7.2 predicted that the structures of miR-205 and miR-338-3p had a binding site on the proto-oncogene, BCL2, which was verified by a luciferase assay. The expression of miR-205 and miR-338-3p were significantly downregulated in prostate carcinoma tissues and LNCaP cells when compared with normal controls. BCL2 expression was significantly inhibited by overexpression of miR-205 and miR-338-3p in LNCaP cells.

This study examined (i) the trajectory of FCR from pre-treatment to 12 months later; (ii) dyadic associations of FCR over time; and (iii) whether cancer treatment type predicted later FCR among prostate cancer patients and their spouses. Methods: Sixty-nine patients and 71 spouses of patients with localized prostate cancer completed a FCR measure at baseline (pre-treatment), 6 months and 12 months later (post-treatment). A repeated measures linear mixed model was used to examine FCR trajectories. Actor-partner interdependence models (APIMs) were conducted on the 52 couples with complete data to examine actor and partner effects and treatment type on subsequent FCR. Results: Patients and spouses reported moderate FCR levels over time, though spouses' FCR was significantly higher than patients' FCR (p < .001). FCR declined significantly for both groups over time (p < .001). APIMs demonstrated significant actor effects in baseline to 6 month, and 6-12 month models. Surgery was significantly associated with lower spouse FCR at 6 months, and radiation with lower patient FCR at 12 months. Conclusions: This is the first study to have concurrently examined FCR longitudinally in prostate cancer patients and spouses. Patients' and spouses' FCR declined from pre- to post-treatment, with spouses experiencing greater FCR than patients over time.

Changes in cancer diagnostics and treatment may have changed the gap in survival between affluent and deprived patients and we investigated if the differences in relative survival by income has changed in Danish cancer patients over the past 25 years. Methods: The 1- and 5-year relative survival by income quintile is computed by comparing survival among cancer patients diagnosed 1987-2009 to the survival of a cancer-free matched sample of the background population. The comparison is done within the 15 most common cancers and all cancers combined. The gap in relative survival due to socioeconomic inequality for the period 1987-1991 is compared the period 2005-2009. Results: The relative 5-year survival increased for all 15 cancer sites investigated in the study period. In general, low-income patients diagnosed in 1987-1991 had between 0% and 11% units lower 5-year relative survival compared with high-income patients; however, only four sites (breast, prostate, bladder and head & neck) were statistically different. In patients diagnosed 2005-2009, the gap in 5-year RS was ranging from 2% to 22% units and statistically significantly different for 9 out of 15 sites. The results for 1-year relative survival were similar to the 5-year survival gap. An estimated 22% of all deaths at five years after diagnosis could be avoided had patients in all income groups had same survival as the high-income group. Conclusion: In this nationwide population-based study, we observed that the large improvements in both short- and long-term cancer survival among patients diagnosed 1987-2009. The improvements have been most pronounced for high-income cancer patients, leading to stable or even increasing survival differences between richest and poorest patients. Improving survival among low-income patients would improve survival rates among Danish cancer patients overall and reduce differences in survival when compared to other Western European countries.""","""['Susanne Oksbjerg Dalton', 'Maja Halgren Olsen', 'Christoffer Johansen', 'Jørgen H Olsen', 'Kaae Klaus Andersen']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Acta Oncol""","""['Italian cancer figures--Report 2015: The burden of rare cancers in Italy.', 'Social inequality in incidence of and survival from cancer in a population-based study in Denmark, 1994-2003: Summary of findings.', 'Trends in the overall survival of cancer patients diagnosed 1964-2003 in the Nordic countries followed up to the end of 2006: the importance of case-mix.', 'Occupational cancer in Denmark.

By this approach, we are able to obtain unbiased estimates of risk for a person with at least k-affected relatives, where k can be specified to determine how risk varies with k. We also derive robust variances of the recurrence risk estimate, to account for correlations within families, such as those induced by shared genes or shared environment, without explicitly modeling the factors that cause familial correlations. Furthermore, we illustrate how mixture models can be used to account for a sample composed of low- and high-risk families. Using simulations, we illustrate the properties of the proposed methods.

Methods:   A total of 200 consecutive patients undergoing Robot-assisted radical prostatectomy by a single surgeon were prospectively evaluated using either the valveless trocar (n = 100) or standard trocars (n = 100). Patient demographics, intra-operative parameters, length of stay, presence or absence of postoperative nausea and vomiting, analog pain score at 0-6 hours, 6-12 hours, 12-18 hours, and >24 hours, and 30-day postoperative complications were analyzed.  Results:   There were no significant differences in estimated blood loss, intra-operative urine output, length of stay, or 30-day complication rates between the two groups. While the VTS group had higher Body Mass Index (BMI) (28.45 vs. 27.23; P = 0.049), the operative time was significantly shorter in the VTS group (146 minutes vs. 167 minutes; P < .005).

Material and methods:   Three hundred and thirteen patients who underwent multiparametric MRI (mpMRI) of the prostate and with available corresponding histology (prostatectomy or biopsy) were selected retrospectively for this study. The MRI protocol consisted of multiplanar T2-and diffusion-weighted imaging, DCE and delayed axial T1 images. Images were reviewed independently by two radiologists for LGE assessment and Prostate Imaging - Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) scoring. For each lesion, semi-quantitative analysis of DCE-MRI was performed and the following data were evaluated: time to peak, wash-in rate, wash-out rate, brevity of enhancement, and area under the curve. The presence or absence of LGE in delayed axial T1 images was assessed qualitatively. MRI results were compared to histology. The presence of significant prostate cancer was based both on Epstein criteria (SPC) and Gleason score (GS ≥7).

In TCGA_PCa cohort study, high expression of SAMD5 was a risk factor for patients on post-operative BCR (HR 2.181, 95%CI 1.199-3.966, p = 0.011) and this predictive ability was independent of Gleason score and pathologic T stage (HR 2.018, 95%CI 1.102-3.698, p = 0.023). In another validating cohort study, the statistic trend was similar, and the pooled analysis by combining the two cohort study further confirmed its prognostic effect.  Conclusion:   SAMD5 mRNA was overexpressed in prostate cancer and had powerful prognostic ability on predicting post-operative BCR, independent of Gleason score and pathologic T stage. Its high expression was associated with poor prognosis after RP.""","""['Fei Li', 'Yong Xu', 'Ran-Lu Liu']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Int Urol Nephrol""","""['Preoperative predictive factors and further risk stratification of biochemical recurrence in clinically localized high-risk prostate cancer.', 'Identification a novel set of 6 differential expressed genes in prostate cancer that can potentially predict biochemical recurrence after curative surgery.', 'The Role of Prostate-specific Antigen Persistence After Radical Prostatectomy for the Prediction of Clinical Progression and Cancer-specific Mortality in Node-positive Prostate Cancer Patients.', 'Decreased expression of serine protease inhibitor family G1 (SERPING1) in prostate cancer can help distinguish high-risk prostate cancer and predicts malignant progression.', 'Different predictive values of microvessel density for biochemical recurrence among different PCa populations: A systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Molecular differences in renal cell carcinoma between males and females.', 'Identification of Potential Predictor of Biochemical Recurrence in Prostate Cancer.', 'A novel immune-related gene-based prognostic signature to predict biochemical recurrence in patients with prostate cancer after radical prostatectomy.', 'MicroRNA-384\xa0inhibits nasopharyngeal carcinoma growth and metastasis via binding to Smad5 and suppressing the Wnt/β-catenin axis.', 'Transcriptome Analysis of Ivosidenib-Mediated Inhibitory Functions on Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer.']"""

Methods:   This study retrospectively included a total of 103 consecutive nmCRPC patients consisting of 47 (45.6%) and 56 (54.4%) who received FGA (bicalutamide or flutamide) and ARATA (abiraterone acetate or enzalutamide), respectively, as the first-line agent after the failure of primary androgen deprivation therapy (ADT).  Results:   There were no significant differences in the major clinicopathological parameters and previous therapeutic histories between the FGA and ARATA groups. During the observation period, 31 (66.0%) and 29 (51.8%) discontinued first-line therapy in the FGA and ARATA groups, respectively, and of these, 27 (87.1%) and 23 (79.3%) in the FGA and ARATA groups, respectively, were subsequently treated with approved agents as second-line therapy. The prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response rate in the FGA group was significantly lower than that in the ARATA group. Although no significant difference in overall survival was noted between the FGA and ARATA groups, there were significant differences in the PSA progression-free survival on first-line therapy and metastasis-free survival between the two groups, favoring the ARATA group compared with FGA group.  Conclusions:   Collectively, these findings suggest that among nmCRPC patients who progressed following treatment with the primary ADT, the introduction of ARATA may result in the delay of disease progression compared with FGA.""","""['Hideaki Miyake', 'Yuto Matsushita', 'Hiromitsu Watanabe', 'Keita Tamura', 'Daisuke Motoyama', 'Toshiki Ito', 'Takayuki Sugiyama', 'Atsushi Otsuka']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Int J Clin Oncol""","""['Comparison of Alternative Androgen Receptor-axis-targeted Agent (ARATA) and Docetaxel as Second-line Therapy for Patients With Metastatic Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer With Progression After Initial ARATA in Real-world Clinical Practice in Japan.', 'Impact of prior androgen receptor-axis-targeted agents on the clinical activity of subsequent docetaxel in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer: comparative assessment between abiraterone acetate and enzalutamide.', 'Comparative Assessment of Efficacies Between 2\xa0Alternative Therapeutic Sequences With Novel\xa0Androgen Receptor-Axis-Targeted Agents\xa0in Patients With Chemotherapy-Naïve Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Treating Patients with Metastatic Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer: A Comprehensive Review of Available Therapies.', 'Metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer: targeting the mechanisms of resistance to abiraterone acetate and enzalutamide.', 'Efficacy and safety of apalutamide in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (GENESIS): protocol for a multicentre, open-label, single-arm clinical trial.', 'Dissecting the Hormonal Signaling Landscape in Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Effectiveness of Vintage Hormone Therapy as Alternative Androgen Deprivation Therapy for Non-metastatic Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Predictors of poor response to first-generation anti-androgens as criteria for alternate treatments for patients with non-metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.']"""

Therefore, we investigated the prevalence of healthy behaviors and sex-specific cancer screening among persons living with HIV, by sex and time since HIV diagnosis.  Methods:   We included 517 persons living with HIV from the Florida Cohort. Data were obtained from the baseline and follow-up questionnaires, electronic medical records, and Enhanced HIV/AIDS Reporting System. The prevalence of self-reported, age-appropriate cancer screening (anal, colorectal, prostate, breast, and cervical), and healthy behaviors (sustaining healthy body weight, refraining from smoking and alcohol and engaging in physical activity) was compared by sex and years since HIV diagnosis (≤ 13 vs. > 13 years).  Results:   In the analyses by sex, females were more likely to be obese than males (56.5% vs. 22.2%, p < 0.0001). Distribution of healthy behaviors did not differ by time since diagnosis among males and females. In the analysis of age-appropriate screening among males, 64.8% never had an anal Pap-smear, 36.2% never had a colonoscopy, and 38.9% never had prostate cancer screening. In the analysis of age-appropriate screening among females, 50.0% never had an anal Pap-smear, 46.5% never had a colonoscopy, 7.9% never had a cervical Pap-smear, and 12.7% never had a mammogram. The difference in anal Pap-smear by sex was statistically significant (p < 0.0001). Among males, the age-adjusted prevalence of never having a colonoscopy was higher in those who had HIV for ≤ 13 years (50.8% vs. 30.6%, p = 0.03).

We evaluated the necessity of antibiotic (AB) prophylaxis in TURP due to increasing microbial antibiotic resistance.  Methods:   This is a prospective cohort study of 506 patients. Only patients with a pre-operative catheter/pyuria received AB-prophylaxis. Urine analysis (pre-operative, at discharge, and 3 week post-operative) was performed next to an analysis of the blood culture/irrigation fluid and of the resected prostatic tissue. Statistical analysis was performed using Fisher's exact test.  Results:   67/506 (13.2%) patients received prophylactic antibiotics. 56/67 (83.5%) patients had a pre-operative catheter and 11/67 (16.4%) had pre-operative pyuria in which a fluoroquinolone-resistance (FQ-R) rate of 69.2% in Escherichia coli (EC) was observed.

Radium-223 improves overall survival and delays the onset of symptomatic skeletal events in patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer and bone metastases. We assessed concurrent treatment with abiraterone acetate plus prednisone or prednisolone and radium-223 in such patients.  Methods:   We did a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial at 165 oncology and urology centres in 19 countries. Eligible patients were aged 18 years or older, and had histologically confirmed, progressive, chemotherapy-naive, asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic castration-resistant prostate cancer and bone metastases, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1, life expectancy of at least 6 months, and adequate haematological, renal, and liver function. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) according to a permuted block design (block size 4) via interactive response technology to receive up to six intravenous injections of radium-223 (55 kBq/kg) or matching placebo once every 4 weeks. All patients were also scheduled to receive oral abiraterone acetate 1000 mg once daily plus oral prednisone or prednisolone 5 mg twice daily during and after radium-223 or placebo treatment. The primary endpoint was symptomatic skeletal event-free survival, which was assessed in the intention-to-treat population. Safety analyses were done in all patients who received at least one dose of any study drug. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02043678. Enrolment has been completed, and follow-up is ongoing.  Findings:   Between March 30, 2014, and Aug 12, 2016, 806 patients were randomly assigned to receive radium-223 (n=401) or placebo (n=405) in addition to abiraterone acetate plus prednisone or prednisolone. The study was unblinded prematurely, on Nov 17, 2017, after more fractures and deaths were noted in the radium-223 group than in the placebo group (in an unplanned ad-hoc analysis), but all patients had completed radium-223 or placebo before this date. At the primary analysis (data cutoff Feb 15, 2018), 196 (49%) of 401 patients in radium-223 group had had at least one symptomatic skeletal event or died, compared with 190 (47%) of 405 patients in the placebo group (median follow-up 21·2 months [IQR 17·0-25·8]). Median symptomatic skeletal event-free survival was 22·3 months (95% CI 20·4-24·8) in the radium-223 group and 26·0 months (21·8-28·3) in the placebo group (hazard ratio 1·122 [95% CI 0·917-1·374]; p=0·2636). Fractures (any grade) occurred in 112 (29%) of 392 patients in the radium-223 group and 45 (11%) of 394 patients in the placebo group. The most common grade 3-4 treatment-emergent adverse events were hypertension (43 [11%] patients in the radium-223 group vs 52 [13%] patients in the placebo group), fractures (36 [9%] vs 12 [3%]) and increased alanine aminotransferase concentrations (34 [9%] vs 28 [7%]). Serious treatment-emergent adverse events occurred in 160 (41%) patients in the radium-223 group and 155 (39%) in the placebo group. Treatment-related deaths occurred in two (1%) patients in the radium-223 group (acute myocardial infarction and interstitial lung disease) and one (<1%) in the placebo group (arrhythmia).  Interpretation:   The addition of radium-223 to abiraterone acetate plus prednisone or prednisolone did not improve symptomatic skeletal event-free survival in patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer and bone metastases, and was associated with an increased frequency of bone fractures compared with placebo. Thus, we do not recommend use of this combination.

We compared the survival of maintenance dialysis patients with that for patients with common cancers to enhance the understanding of the burden of end-stage kidney disease.  Study design:   Population-based cohort study.  Setting & participants:   33,500 incident maintenance dialysis patients in Ontario, Canada, and 532,452 incident patients with cancer (women: breast, colorectal, lung, or pancreas; men: prostate, colorectal, lung, or pancreas) from 1997 to 2015 using administrative health care databases.  Exposure:   Incident kidney failure treated with maintenance dialysis versus incident diagnoses of cancer.  Outcome:   All-cause mortality.  Analytical approach:   Kaplan-Meier product limit estimator was used to describe the survival of subgroups of study participants. Extended Cox regression with a Heaviside function was used to compare survival between patients with incident kidney failure treated with maintenance dialysis and individual diagnoses of various incident cancers.  Results:   In men, dialysis had worse unadjusted 5-year survival (50.8%; 95% CI, 50.1%-51.6%) compared with prostate (83.3%; 95% CI, 83.1%-83.5%) and colorectal (56.1%; 95% CI, 55.7%-56.5%) cancer, but better survival than lung (14.0%; 95% CI, 13.7%-14.3%) and pancreas (9.1%; 95% CI, 8.5%-9.7%) cancer. In women, dialysis had worse unadjusted 5-year survival (49.8%; 95% CI, 48.9%-50.7%) compared with breast (82.1%; 95% CI, 81.9%-82.4%) and colorectal (56.8%; 95% CI, 56.3%-57.2%) cancer, but better survival than lung (19.7%; 95% CI, 19.4%-20.1%) and pancreas (9.4%; 95% CI, 8.9%-10.0%) cancer. After adjusting for clinical characteristics, similar results were found except when examining men and women with lung and pancreas cancer, for which dialysis patients had a higher rate of death 4 or more years after diagnosis.

In high-dose-rate brachytherapy, it is important to measure the dose distribution in the low-dose region at a position away from the source in addition to the high-dose range in the proximity of the source. The aim of this study was to investigate the accuracy of a treatment plan designed for prostate cancer in the low-dose range using a normoxic N-vinylpyrrolidone-based polymer gel (VIPET gel) dosimeter containing inorganic salt as a sensitizer (iVIPET). The dose response was evaluated on the basis of the transverse relaxation rate (R2) measured by magnetic resonance scanning. In the verification of the treatment plan, gamma analysis showed that the dose distributions obtained from the polymer gel dosimeter were in good agreement with those calculated by the treatment planning system. The gamma passing rate according to the 2%/2 mm criterion was 97.9%. The iVIPET gel dosimeter provided better accuracy for low doses than the normal VIPET gel dosimeter, demonstrating the potential to be a useful tool for quality assurance of the dose distribution delivered by high-dose-rate brachytherapy.""","""['Yusuke Watanabe', 'Shinya Mizukami', 'Kou Eguchi', 'Takuya Maeyama', 'Shin-Ichiro Hayashi', 'Hiroshi Muraishi', 'Tsuyoshi Terazaki', 'Tsutomu Gomi']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Phys Med""","""['Comparison of 3D dose distributions for HDR 192Ir brachytherapy sources with normoxic polymer gel dosimetry and treatment planning system.', 'Verification of dose distribution in high-dose-rate brachytherapy using a nanoclay-based radio-fluorogenic gel dosimeter.', 'End-to-end delivery quality assurance of computed tomography-based high-dose-rate brachytherapy using a gel dosimeter.', 'Verification of 3D dose distribution using polymer gel dosimeter.', 'Gel dosimetry for the dose verification of intensity modulated radiotherapy treatments.', 'Chemical Overview of Gel Dosimetry Systems: A Comprehensive Review.', 'Verification of dose distribution in high dose-rate brachytherapy for cervical cancer using a normoxic N-vinylpyrrolidone polymer gel dosimeter.', 'Sensitivity enhancement of DHR123 radio-fluorogenic nanoclay gel dosimeter by incorporating surfactants and halogenides.', 'Improved Dose Response of N-(hydroxymethyl)acrylamide Gel Dosimeter with Calcium Chloride for Radiotherapy.', 'Whole Three-Dimensional Dosimetry of Carbon Ion Beams with an MRI-Based Nanocomposite Fricke Gel Dosimeter Using Rapid T1 Mapping Method.']"""

Treatment planning in brachytherapy involves a decision making process for the placement of the sources in order to deliver an effective dose of radiation to cancerous tissue in the prostate while sparing the surrounding healthy tissue. Such a decision making process can be modeled as a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) problem. In this paper, we introduce a novel MILP optimization model framework for interstitial LDR prostate brachytherapy designed to explicitly mimic the qualities of treatment plans produced manually by expert planners.

In an effort to improve activity and synthetic feasibility of our different series of xanthone-based CYP11B1 and CYP11B2 inhibitors, a small series of imidazolylmethylbenzophenone-based compounds, previously reported as CYP19 inhibitors, was also tested on these new targets, in order to explore the role of a more flexible scaffold for the inhibition of CYP11B1 and -B2 isoforms. Compound 3 proved to be very potent and selective towards CYP11B1, and was thus selected for further optimization via appropriate decoration of the scaffold, leading to new potent 4'-substituted derivatives. In this second series, 4 and 8, carrying a methoxy group and a phenyl ring, respectively, proved to be low-nanomolar inhibitors of CYP11B1, despite a slight decrease in selectivity against CYP11B2. Moreover, unlike the benzophenones of the first series, the 4'-substituted derivatives also proved to be selective for CYP11B enzymes, showing very weak inhibition of CYP19 and CYP17.

Methods:   MpMRI was performed in 30 men with PCa prior to treatment, after 10 days and at 6 months. An additional scan at 1 year was available for 18 men. Two radiologists assessed retrospectively the following parameters by planimetry: tumour volume, necrotic volume (early post-treatment scan) and residual fibrosis. Residual tumour/recurrence were defined as a suspicious area within the treatment field scored ≥ 4 on a 1-to-5 scale. Oncological outcome was also assessed.  Results:   The median follow-up of the entire study was 16 months. Six men were undertreated and showed mpMRI recurrence after 6 months. At 1-year, three additional men had recurrence. Overall, four of these 9 men (44%) were retreated. The other five men did not receive any further treatment. Median time to re-treatment was 15 months. Median pre-treatment lesion volume was 0.65 cc, 0.66 cc and 0.43 cc on the different mpMRI sequences (T2-weighted, diffusion-weighted and dynamic contrast enhanced imaging). Median necrotic volume was 10.77 cc. Median overall residual fibrosis volumes were 0.84 cc and 0.95 cc at 6-month and 1-year mpMRI.

This expanding panel of biomarkers was supplemented, basically, with new genomic technologies, which allowed to look impartially at cancer biology. Such efforts gave several notable success stories, quickly moving biomarkers from the laboratory table to clinical practice.

Both products act synergistically by increasing oxidative stress in cancer cells that causes their death. Though it has already been demonstrated that the best prodrugs of this type retain their antitumor activity in vivo, the effects were found to be substantially weaker than those observed in cell cultures. Moreover, the mechanistic studies of these compounds in vivo are missing. For clarification of these important questions, labeling of the prodrugs with radioactive moieties would be necessary. In this paper, we first observed that the representative NAAF-based prodrugs are hydrolyzed in dilute aqueous solutions to the corresponding arylboronic acids. We confirmed that these products are responsible for ROS amplification and anticancer properties of the parent prodrugs. Next, we developed the efficient synthetic protocol for radiolabeling the hydrolyzed NAAF-based prodrugs by [18F]fluoroglucosylation under the conditions of the copper(I)-catalyzed azide-alkyne 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition and used this protocol to prepare one representative hydrolyzed NAAF-based prodrug radiolabeled with 18F. Finally, we studied the stability of the 18F-labeled compound in human serum in vitro and in rat blood in vivo and obtained preliminary data on its biodistribution in vivo in mice carrying pancreatic (AR42J) and prostate (PC3) tumors by applying PET imaging studies.

We have developed a computational systems biology tool, DrugComboExplorer, to identify driver signaling pathways and predict synergistic drug combinations by integrating the knowledge embedded in vast amounts of available pharmacogenomics and omics data.  Results:   This tool generates driver signaling networks by processing DNA sequencing, gene copy number, DNA methylation and RNA-seq data from individual cancer patients using an integrated pipeline of algorithms, including bootstrap aggregating-based Markov random field, weighted co-expression network analysis and supervised regulatory network learning. It uses a systems pharmacology approach to infer the combinatorial drug efficacies and synergy mechanisms through drug functional module-induced regulation of target expression analysis. Application of our tool on diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and prostate cancer demonstrated how synergistic drug combinations can be discovered to inhibit multiple driver signaling pathways. Compared with existing computational approaches, DrugComboExplorer had higher prediction accuracy based on in vitro experimental validation and probability concordance index. These results demonstrate that our network-based drug efficacy screening approach can reliably prioritize synergistic drug combinations for cancer and uncover potential mechanisms of drug synergy, warranting further studies in individual cancer patients to derive personalized treatment plans.

Especially, accurate brightfield-based cell counting methods are needed for cell growth analysis. With deep learning, cells can be detected with high accuracy, but manually annotated training data is required. We propose a method for cell detection that requires annotated training data for one cell line only, and generalizes to other, unseen cell lines.  Results:   Training a deep learning model with one cell line only can provide accurate detections for similar unseen cell lines (domains). However, if the new domain is very dissimilar from training domain, high precision but lower recall is achieved. Generalization capabilities of the model can be improved with training data transformations, but only to a certain degree. To further improve the detection accuracy of unseen domains, we propose iterative unsupervised domain adaptation method. Predictions of unseen cell lines with high precision enable automatic generation of training data, which is used to train the model together with parts of the previously used annotated training data. We used U-Net-based model, and three consecutive focal planes from brightfield image z-stacks. We trained the model initially with PC-3 cell line, and used LNCaP, BT-474 and 22Rv1 cell lines as target domains for domain adaptation. Highest improvement in accuracy was achieved for 22Rv1 cells. F1-score after supervised training was only 0.65, but after unsupervised domain adaptation we achieved a score of 0.84. Mean accuracy for target domains was 0.87, with mean improvement of 16 percent.  Conclusions:   With our method for generalized cell detection, we can train a model that accurately detects different cell lines from brightfield images. A new cell line can be introduced to the model without a single manual annotation, and after iterative domain adaptation the model is ready to detect these cells with high accuracy.""","""['Kaisa Liimatainen', 'Lauri Kananen', 'Leena Latonen', 'Pekka Ruusuvuori']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""BMC Bioinformatics""","""['Generalizing Deep Learning for Medical Image Segmentation to Unseen Domains via Deep Stacked Transformation.', 'Generalized Fixation Invariant Nuclei Detection Through Domain Adaptation Based Deep Learning.', 'Assessing microscope image focus quality with deep learning.', 'RIL-Contour: a Medical Imaging Dataset Annotation Tool for and with Deep Learning.', 'Monocular Depth Estimation Using Deep Learning: A Review.', 'Low-Resource Adversarial Domain Adaptation for Cross-Modality Nucleus Detection.', 'Bidirectional Mapping-Based Domain Adaptation for Nucleus Detection in Cross-Modality Microscopy Images.']"""

Positive surgical margins (cancer cells having spread into surrounding nonresected tissue) occur in as many as 1 in 5 cases and strongly correlate with disease recurrence and the requirement of adjuvant treatment. Margin assessment is currently only performed by pathologists hours to days following surgery and the integration of a real-time surgical readout would benefit current prostatectomy procedures. Raman spectroscopy is a promising technology to assess surgical margins: its in vivo use during radical prostatectomy could help insure the extent of resected prostate and cancerous tissue is maximized. We thus present the design and development of a dual excitation Raman spectroscopy system (680- and 785-nm excitations) integrated to the robotic da Vinci surgical platform for in vivo use.

Understanding when and if specific types of cessation resources are used can help with planning interventions to more effectively decrease smoking among all cancer survivors, but there is a lack of research on smoking cessation modalities used among cancer survivors.  Methods:   Kentucky Cancer Registry data on incident lung, colorectal, pancreatic, breast, ovarian, and prostate cancer cases diagnosed 2007-2011, were linked with health administrative claims data (Medicaid, Medicare, private insurers) to examine the prevalence of smoking and use of smoking cessation aids 1 year prior and 1 year following the cancer diagnosis. TACs included colorectal, pancreatic, and lung cancers; nTAC included breast, ovarian, and prostate cancers.  Results:   There were 10,033 TAC and 13,670 nTAC survivors. Smoking before diagnosis was significantly higher among TAC survivors (p < 0.0001). Among TAC survivors, smoking before diagnosis was significantly higher among persons who: were males (83%), aged 45-64 (83%), of unknown marital status (84%), had very low education (78%), had public insurance (89%), Medicaid (85%) or were uninsured (84%). Smoking cessation counseling and pharmacotherapy were more common among TAC than nTAC survivors (p < 0.01 and p = 0.05, respectively).  Discussion:   While smoking cessation counseling and pharmacotherapy were higher among TAC survivors, reducing smoking among all cancer survivors remains a priority, given cancer survivors are at increased risk for subsequent chronic diseases, including cancer. Tobacco cessation among all cancer survivors (not just those with TAC) can help improve prognosis, quality of life and reduce the risk of further disease. Health care providers can recommend for individual, group and telephone counseling and/or pharmacotherapy recommendations. These could also be included in survivorship care plans.""","""['M Shayne Gallaway', 'Bin Huang', 'Quan Chen', 'Thomas C Tucker', 'Jaclyn K McDowell', 'Eric Durbin', 'Sherri L Stewart', 'Eric Tai']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""J Community Health""","""['Smoking cessation attitudes and practices among cancer survivors - United States, 2015.', 'The impact of psychosocial characteristics in predicting smoking cessation in long-term cancer survivors: A time-to-event analysis.', 'Identifying Smoking Status and Smoking Cessation Using a Data Linkage Between the Kentucky Cancer Registry and Health Claims Data.', 'Smoking Prevalence and Management Among Cancer Survivors\u2029.', 'The Economic Impact of Smoking and of Reducing Smoking Prevalence: Review of Evidence.', 'Cognitive impairment and edentulism among older adults: an observational study using claims data.', 'Pivoting the Provision of Smoking Cessation Education in a Virtual Clinical World: The Princess Margaret Cancer Centre Experience.', 'National assessment of recommendations from healthcare providers for smoking cessation among adults with cancer.', 'The Survival Impact of Second Primary Lung Cancer in Patients With Lung Cancer.', 'Smoking Cessation After Lung Cancer Diagnosis and the Risk of Second Primary Lung Cancer: The Multiethnic Cohort Study.']"""

Optimization of this scaffold led to the synthesis of compound C23 (Ac-[DLeu]LLLRVK-amidinobenzylamide) with a potent in vivo inhibitory effect on the tumor growth. However, further developments of PACE4 inhibitors may require additional improvements to counter their rapid renal clearance and to increase their tumor targeting efficiency.

In this study, we provide the first comprehensive evidence that cytochrome c deficiency in AA primary tumors and cancer cells abrogates apoptosome-mediated caspase activation and contributes to mitochondrial dysfunction, thereby promoting therapeutic resistance and prostate cancer aggressiveness in AA men. In AA prostate cancer cells, decreased nuclear accumulation of nuclear respiration factor 1 (Nrf1) and its subsequent loss of binding to the cytochrome c promoter mediated cytochrome c deficiency. The activation of cellular Myc (c-Myc) and NF-κB or inhibition of AKT prevented nuclear translocation of Nrf1. Genetic and pharmacologic inhibition of c-Myc and NF-κB or activation of AKT promoted Nrf1 binding to cytochrome c promoter, cytochrome c expression, caspase activation, and cell death. The lack of p-Drp1S616 in AA prostate cancer cells contributed to defective cytochrome c release and increased resistance to apoptosis, indicating that restoration of cytochrome c alone may be insufficient to induce effective apoptosis. Cytochrome c deficiency promoted the acquisition of glycolytic phenotypes and mitochondrial dysfunction, whereas cytochrome c restoration via inhibition of c-Myc and NF-κB or activation of AKT attenuated glycolysis in AA prostate cancer cells. Inhibition of c-Myc and NF-κB enhanced the efficacy of docetaxel in tumor xenografts. Therefore, restoring cytochrome c may overcome therapeutic resistance and prostate cancer aggressiveness in AA men. Overall, this study provides the first comprehensive experimental, mechanistic, and clinical evidence for apoptosome and mitochondrial dysfunction in prostate cancer racial disparity.

Active AR signaling is achieved through the nuclear accumulation of AR following ligand binding and through expression of ligand-independent, constitutively active AR splice variants, such as AR-V7, which is the most commonly expressed variant in metastatic CRPC (mCRPC) patients. Most currently approved PC therapies aim to abrogate AR signaling and activity by inhibiting this ligand-mediated nuclear translocation. In a prospective multi-institutional clinical study, we recently showed that taxane based chemotherapy is also capable of impairing AR nuclear localization (ARNL) in circulating tumor cells (CTCs) from CRPC patients, whereas taxane induced decreases in ARNL were associated with response. Thus, quantitative assessment of ARNL in CTCs can be used to monitor therapeutic response in patients and help guide clinical decisions. Here, we describe the development and implementation of quantitative high throughput (QHT) image analysis algorithms to aid in CTC identification and quantitative assessment of percent ARNL (%ARNL). We applied this algorithm to fifteen CRPC patients at the start of taxane chemotherapy, quantified %ARNL in CTCs, and correlated with expression of AR-V7 mRNA (from CTCs enriched via negative, CD45+ depletion of peripheral blood) and with biochemical (prostate specific antigen; PSA) response to taxane chemotherapy. We found that CTCs from AR-V7 positive patients had higher baseline %ARNL compared to CTCs from AR-V7 negative patients, consistent with the constitutive nuclear localization of AR-V7. In addition, lower %ARNL in CTCs at baseline was associated with biochemical response to taxane chemotherapy. High inter- and intra-patient heterogeneity was also observed. As ARNL is required for active AR signaling, the QHT algorithms described herein can provide prognostic and/or predictive value in future clinical studies.""","""['Daniel Worroll', 'Giuseppe Galletti', 'Ada Gjyrezi', 'David M Nanus', 'Scott T Tagawa', 'Paraskevi Giannakakou']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Phys Biol""","""['Androgen Receptor Splice Variant 7 and Efficacy of Taxane Chemotherapy in Patients With Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Association of AR-V7 on Circulating Tumor Cells as a Treatment-Specific Biomarker With Outcomes and Survival in Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Taxane-induced blockade to nuclear accumulation of the androgen receptor predicts clinical responses in metastatic prostate cancer.', 'Androgen Receptor Splice Variant, AR-V7, as a Biomarker of Resistance to Androgen Axis-Targeted Therapies in Advanced Prostate Cancer.', 'CTC-derived AR-V7 detection as a prognostic and predictive biomarker in advanced prostate cancer.', 'What Do We Have to Know about PD-L1 Expression in Prostate Cancer?

Conclusions:   The underlying pathophysiology of adipose tissue growth following the administration of anti-androgen therapy is discussed, with emphasis on both the canonical Wnt/β-catenin pathway as well as in the Wnt-independent pathway involving direct activation of downstream transcription factors from the T-cell factor family by the androgen receptor.

Furthermore, the over-expression of JunD significantly increased proliferation suggesting JunD regulation of genes required for cell cycle progression. Here, employing gene expression profiling, quantitative proteomics, and validation approaches, we demonstrate that JunD KD is associated with distinct gene and protein expression patterns. Comparative integrative analysis by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) identified 1) cell cycle control/regulation as the top canonical pathway whose members exhibited a significant decrease in their expression following JunD KD including PRDX3, PEA15, KIF2C, and CDK2, and 2) JunD dependent genes are associated with cell proliferation, with MYC as the critical downstream regulator.

Objective:   To assess differences in QOL between men with low-risk prostate cancer who are treated with HRT vs CRT.  Design, setting, and participants:   In this phase 3 randomized clinical trial, men with low-risk prostate cancer were enrolled from sites within the National Cancer Institute's National Clinical Trials Network in the United States, Canada, and Switzerland.  Interventions:   Random assignment to CRT (73.8 Gy in 41 fractions over 8.2 weeks) or to HRT (70 Gy in 28 fractions over 5.6 weeks).  Main outcomes and measures:   Quality of life was assessed using the Expanded Prostate Index Composite questionnaire measuring bowel, urinary, sexual, and hormonal domains; the 25-item Hopkins Symptom Checklist measuring anxiety and depression; and the EuroQol-5 Dimension questionnaire measuring global QOL. All data were collected at baseline and 6, 12, 24, and 60 months. Change scores were compared between treatment arms using the Wilcoxon signed rank test. A significance level of .0125 to adjust for multiple comparisons was used for an overall 2-sided type 1 error of .05. Clinical significance was determined for the Expanded Prostate Index Composite change scores by an effect size of 0.5.  Results:   Of 1092 patients analyzable for the primary end point, 962 (mean [SD] age, 66.6 [7.4] years) consented to the QOL component. No statistically significant differences with regard to baseline characteristics nor any of the QOL baseline domains were measured between arms. There were no differences in change score between arms with respect to any of the Expanded Prostate Index Composite questionnaire domain scores except at 12 months when the HRT arm had a larger decline than the CRT arm in the bowel domain (mean score, -7.5 vs -3.7, respectively; P<.001), but it did not reach clinical significance (effect size = 0.29). There were no differences between arms at any time point for the Hopkins Symptom Checklist nor EuroQol-5 Dimension questionnaire.  Conclusions and relevance:   Treatment with HRT is noninferior to CRT in men with low-risk prostate cancer in terms of disease-free survival and, as shown in the present study, in prostate cancer-specific (eg, bowel, bladder, sexual) and general QOL, as well as in anxiety and depression.

Prostate cancer testing is a partially observable process, and planning for testing requires either extrapolation from randomised controlled trials or, more flexibly, modelling of the cancer natural history. An existing US prostate cancer natural history model (Gulati et al, Biostatistics 2010;11:707-719) did not model for differences in survival between Gleason 6 and 7 cancers and predicted too few Gleason 7 cancers for contemporary Sweden. We re-implemented and re-calibrated the US model to Sweden. We extended the model to more finely describe the disease states, their time to biopsy-detectable cancer and prostate cancer survival. We first calibrated the model to the incidence rate ratio observed in the European Randomised Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer (ERSPC) together with age-specific cancer staging observed in the Stockholm PSA (prostate-specific antigen) and Biopsy Register; we then calibrated age-specific survival by disease states under contemporary testing and treatment using the Swedish National Prostate Cancer Register. After calibration, we were able to closely match observed prostate cancer incidence trends in Sweden. Assuming that patients detected at an earlier stage by screening receive a commensurate survival improvement, we find that the calibrated model replicates the observed mortality reduction in a simulation of ERSPC. Using the resulting model, we predicted incidence and mortality following the introduction of regular testing. Compared with a model of the current testing pattern, organised 8 yearly testing for men aged 55-69 years was predicted to reduce prostate cancer incidence by 14% and increase prostate cancer mortality by 2%. The model is open source and suitable for planning for effective prostate cancer screening into the future.""","""['Andreas Karlsson', 'Alexandra Jauhiainen', 'Roman Gulati', 'Martin Eklund', 'Henrik Grönberg', 'Ruth Etzioni', 'Mark Clements']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Prostate-Specific Antigen-Based Screening for Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Evidence Review for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force Internet.', 'Critical role of prostate biopsy mortality in the number of years of life gained and lost within a prostate cancer screening programme.', 'Uptake of prostate-specific antigen testing for early prostate cancer detection in Sweden.', 'Impact of Prostatic-specific Antigen Threshold and Screening Interval in Prostate Cancer Screening Outcomes: Comparing the Swedish and Finnish European Randomised Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer Centres.', 'Screening for prostate cancer with the prostate-specific antigen test: a review of current evidence.', 'Cost-effectiveness of Prostate Cancer Screening Using Magnetic Resonance Imaging or Standard Biopsy Based on the STHLM3-MRI Study.', 'Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Prostate Cancer Screening in the UK: A Decision Model Analysis Based on the CAP Trial.', 'The cost-effectiveness of prostate cancer screening using the Stockholm3 test.', 'Simulation model of disease incidence driven by diagnostic activity.', 'Personalized early detection and prevention of breast cancer: ENVISION consensus statement.']"""

The research on new heterodimeric lutetium-177 (Lu)-radiopharmaceuticals interacting with two different targets on tumor cells is a strategy for improvement of radiotheranostic performance. This study aimed to synthesize and characterize the Lu-DOTA-PSMA(inhibitor)-Lys-bombesin (Lu-DOTA-iPSMA-Lys-BN) heterodimer and to evaluate its potential to target prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) and gastrin-releasing peptide receptor (GRPr) overexpressed in prostate cancer.  Methods:   The heterodimeric conjugate was synthesized and characterized by infrarred, mass, and H-NMR spectroscopies. The ligand was labeled with Lu and the radiochemical purity was assessed by radio-high-performance liquid chromatography. PSMA/GRPr affinity and the heterobivalent effect on cell viability were evaluated in LNCaP and PC3 prostate cancer cell lines. The biodistribution profile (3 and 96 h) was assessed in athymic mice with induced prostate tumors. Using pulmonary LNCaP (PSMA-positive) and PC3 (GRPr-negative) micrometastasis models, the influence of heterobivalency and affinity on tumor uptake was quantified (micro-SPECT/CT).  Results:   Lu-iPSMA-BN (radiochemical purity>98%) showed specific recognition for PSMA and GRPr (IC50=5.62 and 3.49 nmol/l, respectively) with a significant decrease in cell viability (10.15% of cell viability in LNCaP and 40.10% in PC3 at 48 h), as well as high LNCaP and PC3 tumor uptake (5.21 and 3.21% ID/g at 96 h, respectively). Micro-SPECT/CT imaging showed the heterodimer ability to target the tumors (SUVmax of 1.93±0.30 and 1.76±0.10 in LNCaP and PC3, respectively), possibly influenced by the heterobivalent effect.

According to previous researches, the first step to overcome cancer is to identify driver genes which can promote carcinogenesis. However, it is still a big challenge to precisely and efficiently extract the cancer related driver genes because the nature of cancer is heterogeneous and there exists tremendously irrelevant passenger mutations which have no function impact on the cancer's development. In this work, we proposed a novel entropy-based method namely EntroRank to identify driver genes by integrating the subcellular localization information and mutual exclusive of variation frequency into the network. EntroRank can take into full consideration different properties of driver genes. Considering the modularity of driver genes, the mutated genes in the network were first clustered into different subgroups according to their located compartments. After that, the structural entropy of the gene in the subgroup was employed to measure its indispensability. Considering mutual exclusive property between driver genes in the modules, relative entropy was utilized to measure the degree of mutual exclusive between two mutated genes in terms of their variation frequency. We applied our method to three different cancers including lung, prostate, and breast cancer. The results show our method not only detect the well-known important drivers but also prioritiz the rare unknown driver genes. Besides, EntroRank can identify driver genes having mutual exclusive property. Compared with other existing methods, our method achieves a better performance for most of cancer types in terms of Precision, Recall, and Fscore.""","""['Junrong Song', 'Wei Peng', 'Feng Wang']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""IEEE/ACM Trans Comput Biol Bioinform""","""['A random walk-based method to identify driver genes by integrating the subcellular localization and variation frequency into bipartite graph.', 'Detection of Driver Modules with Rarely Mutated Genes in Cancers.', 'Identifying Cancer Specific Driver Modules Using a Network-Based Method.', 'Identifying Epistasis in Cancer Genomes: A Delicate Affair.', 'Co-occurrence and mutual exclusivity: what cross-cancer mutation patterns can tell us.', 'Identifying driver pathways based on a parameter-free model and a partheno-genetic algorithm.', 'Identifying cancer driver genes based on multi-view heterogeneous graph convolutional network and self-attention mechanism.', 'A tensor-based bi-random walks model for protein function prediction.', 'Identifying Cancer Subtypes Using a Residual Graph Convolution Model on a Sample Similarity Network.', 'A Network-Centric Framework for the Evaluation of Mutual Exclusivity Tests on Cancer Drivers.']"""

To monitor progress in reducing these inequalities, every 3 years the American Cancer Society provides the estimated number of new cancer cases and deaths for blacks in the United States and the most recent data on cancer incidence, mortality, survival, screening, and risk factors using data from the National Cancer Institute, the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries, and the National Center for Health Statistics. In 2019, approximately 202,260 new cases of cancer and 73,030 cancer deaths are expected to occur among blacks in the United States. During 2006 through 2015, the overall cancer incidence rate decreased faster in black men than in white men (2.4% vs 1.7% per year), largely due to the more rapid decline in lung cancer. In contrast, the overall cancer incidence rate was stable in black women (compared with a slight increase in white women), reflecting increasing rates for cancers of the breast, uterine corpus, and pancreas juxtaposed with declining trends for cancers of the lung and colorectum. Overall cancer death rates declined faster in blacks than whites among both males (2.6% vs 1.6% per year) and females (1.5% vs 1.3% per year), largely driven by greater declines for cancers of the lung, colorectum, and prostate. Consequently, the excess risk of overall cancer death in blacks compared with whites dropped from 47% in 1990 to 19% in 2016 in men and from 19% in 1990 to 13% in 2016 in women. Moreover, the black-white cancer disparity has been nearly eliminated in men <50 years and women ≥70 years. Twenty-five years of continuous declines in the cancer death rate among black individuals translates to more than 462,000 fewer cancer deaths.

Methods:   A retrospective analysis was performed of 136 men from the placebo arm of the Reduction by Dutasteride of P.C.a Events (R.E.D.U.C.E.) trial who had a baseline prostate biopsy negative for P.C.a, and were later diagnosed with P.C.a on biopsy and underwent radical prostatectomy over the 4-year study period. The association of baseline P.A.

Results:   P.A. was observed in 74 prostate biopsies (54%). P.A. was not associated with baseline characteristics (age, body mass index, prostate-specific antigen level, prostate volume, race, family history of P.C.a, and digital rectal exam), except for chronic inflammation (p = 0.001).

These variables were compared between patients with and without 3yED. 3yED was defined as an IIEF-5 score change to the lower category between baseline, with or without medication. Results: The 3yED rate was 59% (62% maintained an IIEF-5 > 16). On multivariate analysis, prostate D90% (p > .5) and pretreatment characteristics including age (p > .5), pre-implant potency (p > .5), diabetes (p = .08) and high cardiovascular risk rates (p = .1) did not influence the occurrence of 3yED. Only the PB dose especially the D10% > 51 Gy was associated with 3yED (p = .005). Conversely, dose to the crura, IPAs or NVBs did not seem to impact the erectile function. The prostate position, especially the apex location varied significantly between potent and impotent patients and 3yED was significantly associated with close position of the prostate apex to PB (p = .008). Conclusion: The most predictive factor of 3yED was the dose to the PB. This may be explained by variation in individual patients' anatomy and this could allow for the development of better strategies to prevent ED.""","""['Matthieu Chasseray', 'Gurvan Dissaux', 'Vincent Bourbonne', 'Nicolas Boussion', 'Gaelle Goasduff', 'Julien Malloreau', 'Jean-Pierre Malhaire', 'Georges Fournier', 'Valentin Tissot', 'Olivier Pradier', 'Antoine Valeri', 'Ulrike Schick']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Acta Oncol""","""['The importance of radiation doses to the penile bulb vs. crura in the development of postbrachytherapy erectile dysfunction.', 'A comparison of radiation dose to the bulb of the penis in men with and without prostate brachytherapy-induced erectile dysfunction.', 'There is no correlation between erectile dysfunction and dose to penile bulb and neurovascular bundles following real-time low-dose-rate prostate brachytherapy.', 'Erectile dysfunction after radiotherapy for prostate cancer and radiation dose to the penile structures: a critical review.', 'The concept of erectile function preservation (penile rehabilitation) in the patient after brachytherapy for prostate cancer.', 'Impact of age on the Quadrella index assessing oncological and functional results after prostate brachytherapy: A 6-year analysis.', 'Toxicity in patients treated with permanent prostate brachytherapy using intraoperatively built custom-linked seeds versus loose seeds.']"""

Materials and methods:   The study comprised 112 men aged 52 to 84 years with a morphologically verified diagnosis of prostate cancer. All patients underwent pelvic mp-MRI before radical prostatectomy (RPE) no earlier than six weeks after the prostate biopsy. Radical prostatectomy was performed within two weeks after mp-MRI.

Previous studies have shown that priming natural killer (NK) cells isolated from healthy individuals via co-incubation with CTV-1 cells derived from an acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) enhances their cytotoxicity against human DU145 (metastatic) prostate cancer cells, but it remains unknown to what extent NK cells from patients with prostate cancer can be triggered to kill. Herein, we explore the phenotype of peripheral blood NK cells in patients with prostate cancer and compare the capacity of CTV-1 cell-mediated priming and IL-2 stimulation to trigger NK cell-mediated killing of the human PC3 (metastatic) prostate cancer cell line. Methods: The phenotype of resting, primed (co-incubation with CTV-1 cells for 17 h) and IL-2 activated (100 IU/ml IL-2 for 17 h) NK cells isolated from frozen-thawed peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) preparations from patients with benign disease (n = 6) and prostate cancer (n = 18) and their cytotoxicity against PC3 and K562 cells was determined by flow cytometry. Relationship(s) between NK cell phenotypic features and cytotoxic potential were interrogated using Spearman Rank correlation matrices. Results and Conclusions: NK cell priming and IL-2 activation of patient-derived NK cells resulted in similar levels of cytotoxicity, but distinct NK cell phenotypes. Importantly, the capacity of priming and IL-2 stimulation to trigger cytotoxicity was patient-dependent and mutually exclusive, in that NK cells from ~50% of patients preferentially responded to priming whereas NK cells from the remaining patients preferentially responded to cytokine stimulation. In addition to providing more insight into the biology of primed and cytokine-stimulated NK cells, this study supports the use of autologous NK cell-based immunotherapies for the treatment of prostate cancer. However, our findings also indicate that patients will need to be stratified according to their potential responsiveness to individual therapeutic approaches.""","""['Simon P Hood', 'Gemma A Foulds', 'Heather Imrie', 'Stephen Reeder', 'Stéphanie E B McArdle', 'Masood Khan', 'Alan Graham Pockley']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Front Immunol""","""['Tumor- and cytokine-primed human natural killer cells exhibit distinct phenotypic and transcriptional signatures.', 'The cytotoxic potential of interleukin-15-stimulated cytokine-induced killer cells against leukemia cells.', 'UV Light-inactivated HSV-1 Stimulates Natural Killer Cell-induced Killing of Prostate Cancer Cells.', 'Investigation of NK cell function and their modulation in different malignancies.', 'From the ""missing self"" hypothesis to adaptive NK cells: Insights of NK cell-mediated effector functions in immune surveillance.', 'Natural Killer Cell-Derived Extracellular Vesicles as a Promising Immunotherapeutic Strategy for Cancer: A Systematic Review.', 'The effects of acute exercise and inflammation on immune function in early-stage prostate cancer.', 'Natural killer cells: a promising immunotherapy for cancer.', 'Modulation of Host Immune Response during Leishmania infantum Natural Infection: A Whole-Transcriptome Analysis of the Popliteal Lymph Nodes in Dogs.', 'Prostate Cancer Peripheral Blood NK Cells Show Enhanced CD9, CD49a, CXCR4, CXCL8, MMP-9 Production and Secrete Monocyte-Recruiting and Polarizing Factors.']"""

We have analyzed the clinical, radiological, and pathologic factors associated with GG downgrading in final pathology. Downgrading was defined as those patients who downgraded from GG 3, 4, or 5 on biopsy to GG 1 or 2 on final pathology as well as patients who downgraded from GG 2 on biopsy to GG 1 on final pathology. Categorical values were compared with chi-square and Fischer's exact tests. Mann-Whitney U and Kruskal-Wallis were used for analysis of independent variables associated with GG downgrading.  Results:   Ninety-three patients underwent fusion biopsy (FB) and 443 underwent the standard 12 core biopsy. Baseline clinical characteristics were similar between the 2 groups except for race (P = .009). Downgrading was observed in 76 patients (14.1%). Rate of downgrading was higher in the FB group (n = 22, 23.7% vs n = 54, 12.2%, P = .008). In multivariable logistic regression analysis, FB (OR:2.39, P = .004) and maximum percentage of core involvement (OR:1.01, P = .013) were associated with downgrading after robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy. After 1:2 propensity score matching, FB was still associated with an increased rate of downgrading (P = .034). Downgrading had no significant effect on pathologic outcome.

In order to effectively understand progression of a patient-specific tumor, one needs to comprehensively sample tumor DNA at multiple time points, ideally obtained through inexpensive and minimally invasive techniques. Current sequencing technologies make the 'liquid biopsy' possible, which involves sampling a patient's blood or urine and sequencing the circulating cell free DNA (cfDNA). A certain percentage of this DNA originates from the tumor, known as circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA). The ratio of ctDNA may be extremely low in the sample, and the ctDNA may originate from multiple tumors or clones. These factors present unique challenges for applying existing tools and workflows to the analysis of ctDNA, especially in the detection of structural variations which rely on sufficient read coverage to be detectable.  Results:   Here we introduce SViCT , a structural variation (SV) detection tool designed to handle the challenges associated with cfDNA analysis. SViCT can detect breakpoints and sequences of various structural variations including deletions, insertions, inversions, duplications and translocations. SViCT extracts discordant read pairs, one-end anchors and soft-clipped/split reads, assembles them into contigs, and re-maps contig intervals to a reference genome using an efficient k-mer indexing approach. The intervals are then joined using a combination of graph and greedy algorithms to identify specific structural variant signatures. We assessed the performance of SViCT and compared it to state-of-the-art tools using simulated cfDNA datasets with properties matching those of real cfDNA samples. The positive predictive value and sensitivity of our tool was superior to all the tested tools and reasonable performance was maintained down to the lowest dilution of 0.01% tumor DNA in simulated datasets. Additionally, SViCT was able to detect all known SVs in two real cfDNA reference datasets (at 0.6-5% ctDNA) and predict a novel structural variant in a prostate cancer cohort.

To obtain further insight into low-level molecular interactions within these different structural domains, we now introduce graphlet decomposition over a range of proximity thresholds and show that frequency of different subgraph (k = 4 nodes) patterns for machine learning approaches (classification, identification, automatic labeling, etc.) effectively distinguishes caveolae and scaffold blobs.  Results:   Caveolae formation requires both Cav1 and the adaptor protein CAVIN1 (also called PTRF). As a supervised learning approach, we applied a wide-field CAVIN1/PTRF mask to CAVIN1/PTRF-transfected PC3 prostate cancer cells and used the random forest classifier to classify blobs based on graphlet frequency distribution (GFD). GFD of CAVIN1/PTRF-positive (PTRF+) and -negative Cav1 clusters showed poor classification accuracy that was significantly improved by stratifying the PTRF+ clusters by either number of localizations or volume. Low classification accuracy (<50%) of large PTRF+ clusters and caveolae blobs identified by unsupervised learning suggests that their GFD is specific to caveolae. High classification accuracy for small PTRF+ clusters and caveolae blobs argues that CAVIN1/PTRF associates not only with caveolae but also non-caveolar scaffolds. At low proximity thresholds (50-100 nm), the caveolae groups showed reduced frequency of highly connected graphlets and increased frequency of completely disconnected graphlets. GFD analysis of single-molecule localization microscopy Cav1 clusters defines changes in structural organization in caveolae and scaffolds independent of association with CAVIN1/PTRF.

We have demonstrated, for the first time, that variable angle micro ATR-FTIR, which is created via the insertion of circular apertures, is intrinsic at examining embedded components within a prostate tissue specimen. This is done by constructing a 3D model from the stacks of 2D chemical images obtained, each of which represents the spatial distribution of a chosen spectral band assigned to the component of interest at a different probing depth. ATR-FTIR imaging is also shown to have the ability to resolve subcellular components of cells such as organelles. For differentiation of diseased and non-diseased tissues, statistical tests are employed to analyse the spectral datasets obtained. When the second derivative of the spectral datasets was subjected to t-test analysis, the spectral differences between both samples in the fingerprint region are shown to be more significant at a shallow depth of penetration, with the greatest variance at the spectral band of 1235 cm-1 (vasPO2-), depicted by plotting the scores of PCA on its first two PCs.

We quantified the likelihood of quitting drinking in relation to the onset of a variety of health conditions.  Methods:   Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of ceasing alcohol consumption after diagnosis of 28 health conditions and 4 general indicators of health were derived from logistic regression among 97,852 drinkers aged ≥ 45 years between baseline (2006 to 2009) and median 5.3 years of follow-up in the New South Wales 45 and Up Study. Incident health conditions at follow-up were self-reported.  Results:   At follow-up, 9.6% (n = 9,438) of drinkers had ceased drinking. Drinking cessation was significantly associated with 24 of 32 health conditions examined: 15.4% of participants with newly diagnosed diabetes quit drinking (OR for quitting vs. continuing 1.77, 95% CI: 1.60 to 1.96), 16.4% with Parkinson's disease (1.71, 1.35 to 2.17), 17.8% with poor memory (1.68, 1.43 to 1.97), 19.2% with hip fracture (1.64, 1.30 to 2.06), 14.7% with stroke (1.45, 1.27 to 1.66), 12.5% with depression (1.40, 1.26 to 1.55), 15.0% with breast cancer (1.38, 1.18 to 1.61), 12.3% with heart disease (1.34, 1.25 to 1.44), and 13.3% with osteoarthritis (1.22, 1.12 to 1.33).

We investigated the association between education as an indicator for socioeconomic position and cardiovascular events after prostate cancer and if such associations were mediated by differences in lifestyle, cardiovascular risk factors and prostate cancer treatment. Material and methods: We identified 1980 men diagnosed with prostate cancer from 1993 to 2014 among participants in the Danish Diet, Cancer and Health study. Individual level information on education, lifestyle, cardiovascular risk factors and prostate cancer clinical information were obtained from questionnaires, registries and medical records.

Results: Compared to men with long education, we found an increased risk of acute myocardial infarction in men with medium and short education (HR 3.14, 95% CI 1.53-6.47 and HR 2.14, 95% CI 0.82-5.58, respectively).

There were no educational differences in risk for ischemic stroke or heart failure. Conclusions: The risk of acute myocardial infarction was increased in prostate cancer patients with short or medium education compared with long education.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are the most well studied noncoding RNAs in cancers. In the current study, we were interested in defining the function of aspirin in lung cancer treatment and the related noncoding RNAs involved in this process.  Methods:   The function of aspirin in lung cancer growth was evaluated by cell viability and colony formation assays. Screening of miRNAs affected by aspirin was performed through quantitative real-time PCR. Prediction of miR-98 targeting WNT1 was performed using online bioinformatics software and was further confirmed by luciferase reporter gene analysis. The levels of miR-98 and WNT1 were tested through immunoblotting and quantitative real-time PCR analysis in lung cancer cells under aspirin treatment.  Results:   Cell viability was sharply suppressed in lung cancer cells with an increasing dose of aspirin. Aspirin markedly weakened the malignant colony formation ability of lung cancer cells. One out of six tumor suppressor miRNAs could be obviously regulated by aspirin in lung cancer cells. The inhibition of miR-98 on the luciferase activities of wild-type 3' untranslated region vectors of WNT1 was clearly revealed in lung cancer cells. Meanwhile, the inhibitor of miR-98 increased the luciferase activities of wild-type 3' untranslated region vectors of WNT1. After treatment with aspirin the expression of miR-98 was induced and then its target gene, WNT1, was depressed in the cells.

The prostate was contoured independently on each imaging dataset by three clinicians. Interobserver variability was assessed using comparison indices with Monaco ADMIRE (research version 2.0, Elekta AB) and examined for statistical differences between imaging sets. CT and MR images of two test objects were acquired to assess geometric distortion and accuracy of marker positioning. The first was a linear test object comprising straight tubes in three orthogonal directions, the second was a smaller test object with markers suspended in gel.  Results:   Interobserver variability for prostate contouring was lower for both T2W and T2*W compared to CT, this was statistically significant when comparing CT and T2*W images. All markers are visible in T2*W images with 29/30 correctly identified, only 3/30 are visible in T2W images. Assessment of geometric distortion revealed in-plane displacements were under 0.375 mm in MRI, and through plane displacements could not be detected. The signal loss in the MR images is symmetric in relation to the true marker position shown in CT images.

Methods:   Within the National Inpatient Sample (2008-2013), we identified patients with non-metastatic upper tract urothelial carcinoma treated with either minimally invasive nephroureterectomy or open nephroureterectomy. We relied on inverse probability of treatment weighting to reduce the effect of inherent differences between open nephroureterectomy versus minimally invasive nephroureterectomy. Multivariable logistic regression, multivariable Poisson regression models and multivariable linear regression models were used.  Results:   Between 2008 and 2013, we identified 3897 patients treated with either minimally invasive nephroureterectomy (1093 [28%]) or open nephroureterectomy (2804 [72%]). In multivariable logistic regression models, minimally invasive nephroureterectomy resulted in lower rates of overall (odds ratio 0.71, P < 0.001), wound (odds ratio 0.49, P = 0.01), intraoperative (odds ratio 0.55, P = 0.01), miscellaneous surgical (odds ratio 0.64, P = 0.008) and miscellaneous medical complications (odds ratio 0.77, P = 0.002). Furthermore, minimally invasive nephroureterectomy was associated with lower rates of transfusions (odds ratio 0.61, P < 0.001). In multivariable Poisson regression models, minimally invasive nephroureterectomy was associated with shorter length of stay (relative risk 0.88, P < 0.001). Finally, higher total hospital charges ($2500 more per patient) were recorded for minimally invasive nephroureterectomy.

A qualitative study of among Navajo cancer survivors, in which focus groups and individual interviews included questions related to perceptions of cancer causes, prevention, and treatment, allowed us to evaluate several aspects of the cancer experience from the Navajo perspective. An experienced, bilingual facilitator led the discussions using a standardized guide. Discussions were audio-recorded, documented by field notes, translated, as needed, and transcribed. NVivo software was used to summarize major themes according to the PEN-3 and health belief models. Navajo cancer survivors (N = 32) were both males (n = 13) and females (n = 19) that had been previously diagnosed with a variety of cancers: colorectal, breast, ovarian, cervical, esophageal, gall bladder, stomach, prostate, kidney, and hematologic. Many survivors had accurate knowledge of risk factors for cancer. Barriers to screening and clinical care included language, expense, geography, fear, lack of information, skepticism related to Western medicine, and treatment side effects. While some survivors experienced familial support, others were isolated from the family and community due to the perspective of cancer as a contagion. However, resilience, hope, trust in select community organizations, a desire to restore balance, and to support younger generations were positive attributes expressed regarding the treatment and recovery process. These evaluations need to be replicated across a larger cross-section of the Native cancer survivor community.""","""['Jennifer W Bea', ""Hendrik 'Dirk' de Heer"", 'Brian Kinslow', 'Luis Valdez', 'Etta Yazzie', 'Pearl Curley', 'Shelby Dalgai', 'Anna L Schwartz']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""J Cancer Educ""","""['Physical Activity among Navajo Cancer Survivors: A Qualitative Study.', ""American Indian women cancer survivors' coping with depressive symptoms."", 'Cancer Journey for American Indians and Alaska Natives in the Pacific Northwest\u2029.', 'Qualitative evaluation of a community health representative program on patient experiences in Navajo Nation.', 'Native American cancer survivors.', 'Cancer beliefs and screening behaviors: The impact of neighborhood and other social determinants of health.', 'Formative Evaluation and Adaptation of a Navajo Cancer Survivor Physical Activity Intervention to Serve a Broader Native American Cancer Survivor Community.', 'Development of a culturally relevant physical activity intervention for Navajo cancer survivors.']"""

In this study we explored the crosstalk between PCa cells and OCys to determine if it contributes to PCa progression. PCa cells induced OCys to promote PCa proliferation, migration and invasion. A chemokine screen revealed that PCa cell induced OCys to produce growth-derived factor 15 (GDF15). Knockdown of GDF15 in OCys demonstrated that PCa cells conferred the ability on OCys to promote PCa proliferation, migration and invasion through GDF15. Consistent with this finding was the observation that the GDF15 receptor, GFRAL, was expressed on multiple PCa cell lines. Transcription factor array screening of PCa cells exposed to OCys with or without knockdown of GDF15 revealed that GDF15 in OCys promoted early growth response 1 (EGR1) expression in the PCa cells. Knockdown of EGR1 expression in PCa cells revealed it was required for the OCy-derived GDF15-mediated induction of in vitro PCa cell proliferation, migration and invasion. Subcutaneous co-injection of PCa cells and OCys into mice revealed that OCys promoted tumor growth in vivo, which was diminished by knockdown of GDF15 in the OCys. Knockdown of GDF15 in the tibiae diminished growth of PCa cancer cells injected into the tibiae, which was accompanied by decreased tumor cell proliferation and EGR1 expression. These results shed light on a novel mechanism through which PCa cells educate OCys to promote progression of PCa bone metastasis. They also suggest that targeting of GDF15-based and EGR1-based signaling pathways should be further explored for their potential to diminish progression of PCa bone metastasis.""","""['Wenchu Wang', 'Xin Yang', 'Jinlu Dai', 'Yi Lu', 'Jian Zhang', 'Evan T Keller']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Oncogene""","""['Osteocyte Vegf-a contributes to myeloma-associated angiogenesis and is regulated by Fgf23.', 'm6 A modification of lncRNA PCAT6 promotes bone metastasis in prostate cancer through IGF2BP2-mediated IGF1R mRNA stabilization.', 'Transcriptional Regulation of GDF15 by EGR1 Promotes Head and Neck Cancer Progression through a Positive Feedback Loop.', 'Regulation of osteoclastogenesis by osteocytes through growth differentiation factor-15.', 'Growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF15) in cancer cell metastasis: from the cells to the patients.', 'Growth differentiation factor 15 induces cisplatin resistance through upregulation of xCT expression and glutathione synthesis in gastric cancer.', 'The interaction between osteosarcoma and other cells in the bone microenvironment: From mechanism to clinical applications.', 'Osteocytes: New Kids on the Block for Cancer in Bone Therapy.', 'Regulation of the Osteocyte Secretome with Aging and Disease.', 'Animal models of cancer metastasis to the bone.']"""

Holistic needs assessments (HNA) are designed to capture these, but are traditionally paper-based, generic, and only carried out in secondary care despite national initiatives advocating a ""shared care"" approach. We developed an online prostate cancer-specific HNA (sHNA) built into existing IT healthcare infrastructure to provide a platform for service integration. Barriers and facilitators to implementation and use of the sHNA were explored from both the patients and healthcare professionals (HCPs) perspectives.  Methods:   This qualitative study consisted of two phases. Phase 1 used semi-structured interviews to explore HCPs (n = 8) and patients (n = 10) perceptions of the sHNA, prior to implementation. Findings were used to develop an implementation strategy. Phase 2 used semi-structured interviews to explore HCPs (n = 4) and patients (n = 7) experienced barriers and motivators to using the sHNA, 9 to 12 months after implementation. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim and thematically analysed. Themes were mapped to the Theoretical Domains Framework.  Results:   HCPs and patients anticipated many benefits from using the sHNA. Barriers to implementation included: confidence to work in depth with prostate cancer patients, organisational and cultural change, and patient factors. Our implementation strategy addressed these barriers by the provision of disease specific training delivered in part by a clinical nurse specialist; and a peer-led IT supporter. Following implementation HCPs and patients perceived the sHNA as beneficial to their practice and care, respectively. However, some patients experienced barriers in using the sHNA related predominately to symptom perception and time since treatment. HCPs suggested minor software refinements.  Conclusions:   This work supports the importance of identifying barriers and motivators to implementation, and using targeted action via the development of an implementation strategy to address these. Whilst this process should be on-going, undertaking this work at an early stage will help to optimise the implementation of the sHNA for future trials.""","""['Amy L Clarke', 'Julia Roscoe', 'Rebecca Appleton', 'Jeremy Dale', 'Veronica Nanton']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""BMC Health Serv Res""","""['Promoting integrated care in prostate cancer through online prostate cancer-specific holistic needs assessment: a feasibility study in primary care.', 'Attitudes towards, facilitators and barriers to the provision of diabetes self-care support: A qualitative study among healthcare providers in Ghana.', ""A qualitative study of healthcare professionals' experiences of providing maternity care for Muslim women in the UK."", 'New ways of working in mental health services: a qualitative, comparative case study assessing and informing the emergence of new peer worker roles in mental health services in England.', 'Factors that impact on the use of mechanical ventilation weaning protocols in critically ill adults and children: a qualitative evidence-synthesis.', 'A Web-Based Prostate Cancer-Specific Holistic Needs Assessment (CHAT-P): Multimethod Study From Concept to Clinical Practice.', 'Health information technology to support cancer survivorship care planning: A systematic review.', 'Digital and Mobile Technologies to Promote Physical Health Behavior Change and Provide Psychological Support for Patients Undergoing Elective Surgery: Meta-Ethnography and Systematic Review.', 'Experiences of digital communication with automated patient interviews and asynchronous chat in Swedish primary care: a qualitative study.', 'Promoting integrated care in prostate cancer through online prostate cancer-specific holistic needs assessment: a feasibility study in primary care.']"""

Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) has been widely used for the early detection of PCa; however, it is not an ideal biomarker due to its low specificity. Aberrant glycosylation is closely associated with malignant transformation and cancer progression. Recent advances in glycobiology techniques can be applied to the development of novel biomarkers for PCa. We previously identified PCa-associated aberrant glycosylation on PSA, that is, α2,3-linked sialylation as an additional terminal N-glycan on free PSA(S2,3PSA). We then developed a new assay system for the measurement of S2,3PSA utilizing the μTAS method. The area under the curve (AUC) for the detection of PCa with the %S2,3PSA ratio was significantly better than that with total PSA. Another urgent issue in clinical practice for PCa is the over-treatment of patients with a low malignant potential, as aggressive treatment is not necessary. To overcome this problem, it is essential to develop a useful tool for the measurement of the malignant potential. Core2 ,β-1,6-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase-1 (GCNT1, C2GnT) is a key enzyme that forms core 2-branched 0-glycans. Its expression is associated with the progression of several cancers. We established a mouse IgG monoclonal antibody (mAb) against GCNT1 and examined the relationship of GCNT1 expression with the clinicopathological status of PCa. GCNT1- negative patients were associated with significantly better PSA-free survival compared with GCNT1-positive patients. Furthermore, we established new methods for GCNT1 detection using urine samples of PCa patients. Immunoblotting was used to examine post-digital rectal examination (DRE) urine from PCa patients. Over 90% of GCNT1-positive PCa patients with high concentrations of serum PSA showed extracapsular extension in prostatectomy specimens. In conclusion, the clinical application of glycobiology techniques is a promising approach to develop novel biomarkers for PCa.""","""['Chikara Ohyama', 'Tohru Yoneyama', 'Yuki Tobisawa', 'Tomokazu Ishikawa', 'Shingo Hatakeyama', 'Takuya Koie', 'Kazuyuki Mori']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Rinsho Byori""","""['Detection of Core2 β-1,6-N-Acetylglucosaminyltransferase in Post-Digital Rectal Examination Urine Is a Reliable Indicator for Extracapsular Extension of Prostate Cancer.', 'An Automated Micro-Total Immunoassay System for Measuring Cancer-Associated α2,3-linked Sialyl N-Glycan-Carrying Prostate-Specific Antigen May Improve the Accuracy of Prostate Cancer Diagnosis.', 'Measurement of aberrant glycosylation of prostate specific antigen can improve specificity in early detection of prostate cancer.', 'Recent progress and perspectives on prostate cancer biomarkers.', 'Prostate-specific antigen and other serum and urine markers in prostate cancer.']"""

IL-6 is an important positive regulator of AR activity and can stimulate the expression of prostate-specific antigen in a ligand-independent manner.

Three dimensional studies of human lymphocytes in such environments are lacking. We hypothesized that aligned collagenous environment modulates CD8+ T cells motility. We encapsulated activated CD8+ T cells in collagen hydrogels of distinct fiber alignment, a characteristic of tumor microenvironments. We found that human CD8+ T cells move faster and more persistently in aligned collagen fibers compared with nonaligned collagen fibers. Moreover, CD8+ T cells move along the axis of collagen alignment. We showed that myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) inhibition could nullify the effect of aligned collagen on CD8+ T cell motility patterns by decreasing T cell turning in unaligned collagen fiber gels. Finally, as an example of a tertiary lymphoid site, we found that xenograft prostate tumors exhibit highly aligned collagen fibers. We observed CD8+ T cells alongside aligned collagen fibers, and found that they are mostly concentrated in the periphery of tumors. Overall, using an in vitro controlled hydrogel system, we show that collagen fiber organization modulates CD8+ T cells movement via MLCK activation thus providing basis for future studies into relevant therapeutics.""","""['Hawley C Pruitt', 'Daniel Lewis', 'Mark Ciccaglione', 'Sydney Connor', 'Quinton Smith', 'John W Hickey', 'Jonathan P Schneck', 'Sharon Gerecht']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Matrix Biol""","""['Rapid Quantification of 3D Collagen Fiber Alignment and Fiber Intersection Correlations with High Sensitivity.', 'Contact guidance diversity in rotationally aligned collagen matrices.', 'Microtissue size and cell-cell communication modulate cell migration in arrayed 3D collagen gels.', 'Directing fibroblast self-assembly to fabricate highly-aligned, collagen-rich matrices.', 'The memory of a killer T cell: models of CD8(+) T cell differentiation.', 'Microengineering 3D Collagen Matrices with Tumor-Mimetic Gradients in Fiber Alignment.', 'Integrated Multi-omics Analysis of Early Lung Adenocarcinoma Links Tumor Biological Features with Predicted Indolence or Aggressiveness.', 'Association of collagen deep learning classifier with prognosis and chemotherapy benefits in stage II-III colon cancer.', 'Barriers to immune cell infiltration in tumors.', 'Extracellular matrix profiles determine risk and prognosis of the squamous cell carcinoma subtype of non-small cell lung carcinoma.']"""

Hormonal therapy often mitigates PCa progression, but a notable number of cases progress to castration-resistant PCa (CRPC). CRPC retains AR activity and is incurable. Long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) represent an uncharted region of the transcriptome. Several lncRNA have been recently described to mediate oncogenic functions, suggesting that these molecules can be potential therapeutic targets. Here, we identified CRPC-associated lncRNA by analyzing patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) and clinical data. Subsequently, we characterized one of the CRPC-promoting lncRNA, HORAS5, in vitro and in vivo. We demonstrated that HORAS5 is a stable, cytoplasmic lncRNA that promotes CRPC proliferation and survival by maintaining AR activity under androgen-depleted conditions. Most strikingly, knockdown of HORAS5 causes a significant reduction in the expression of AR itself and oncogenic AR targets such as KIAA0101. Elevated expression of HORAS5 is also associated with worse clinical outcomes in patients. Our results from HORAS5 inhibition in in vivo models further confirm that HORAS5 is a viable therapeutic target for CRPC. Thus, we posit that HORAS5 is a novel, targetable mediator of CRPC through its essential role in the maintenance of oncogenic AR activity.

Efforts are continuously undertaken to provide more patient-centered healthcare. The application of point-of-care (POC) systems for laboratory analyses represents a step in this direction. Previous investigations on total PSA measurements using a POC system (concile® Ω100 POC reader) showed good concordance with standard laboratory measurements. For the same POC reader a novel system for fPSA was developed. In the current study, we prospectively evaluated the quality of the POC system for fPSA.  Methods:   Sixty-four patients undergoing PSA measurements in our outpatient clinic between 06/2015 and 09/2015 were enrolled in the study. We measured total PSA (tPSA) and fPSA with a POC reader system (concile® Ω100) and a standard laboratory system (Siemens Immulite 2000®) and compared the respective results using linear regression analyses for PSA, fPSA, and fPSA/tPSA ratio (%fPSA).  Results:   The coefficients of determination (r²) for fPSA and %fPSA were 0.85 (p < 0.001) and 0.82 (p < 0.001) in the subgroup with total PSA between 4 and 10 ng/mL. In the subgroup with tPSA ≤ 4 ng/mL, r² for fPSA concile® was 0.55 (p < 0.001) and 0.10 (p = 0.088) for %fPSA. In the subgroup of tPSA > 10 ng/mL the r² for fPSA and %fPSA was 0.50 (p = 0.022) and 0.50 (p = 0.022), respectively.  Conclusions:   The POC fPSA values correlated well with the laboratory analyses, specifically in the clinically relevant diagnostic range of tPSA 4 - 10 ng/mL. These results complement the tPSA data obtained previously and indicate the reliability of the fPSA method and the resulting %fPSA score.""","""['Inês Anselmo da Costa', 'Jörg Hennenlotter', 'Tilman Todenhöfer', 'Eva Neumann', 'Susanne Deininger', 'Stefan Aufderklamm', 'Jens Bedke', 'Arnulf Stenzl', 'Steffen Rausch']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Clin Lab""","""['Assessment of a new point-of-care system for detection of prostate specific antigen.', 'Percent free PSA as an additional measure in a prostate cancer screen.', 'Comparisons of the various combinations of free, complexed, and total prostate-specific antigen for the detection of prostate cancer.', 'Screening for prostate cancer in 2008 II: the importance of molecular subforms of prostate-specific antigen and tissue kallikreins.', 'Advanced nanoengineered-customized point-of-care tools for prostate-specific antigen.']"""

We show that the two proteins are stimulated to interact in cells during apoptosis. Using peptide array screening and computational methods we mapped the interaction interfaces of both proteins to residues 764-778 of iASPP that bind to a surface groove of NAF-1. A peptide corresponding to the iASPP 764-780 sequence stabilized the NAF-1 cluster, inhibited NAF-1 interaction with iASPP, and inhibited staurosporine-induced apoptosis activation in human breast cancer, as well as in PC-3 prostate cancer cells in which p53 is inactive. The iASPP 764-780 IC50 value for inhibition of cell death in breast cancer cells was 13 ± 1 μM. The level of cell death inhibition by iASPP 764-780 was altered in breast cancer cells expressing different levels and/or variants of NAF-1, indicating that the peptide activity is associated with NAF-1 function. We propose that the interaction between iASPP and NAF-1 is required for apoptosis activation in cancer cells.

Here we analyzed a tissue microarray consisting of normal prostate, benign prostatic hyperplasia, high grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (HGPIN) and primary prostate cancer cases for UXT protein expression. We found that HGPIN and malignant tumors have significantly decreased UXT expression compared to the normal prostate. Loss of UXT expression in primary prostate cancer is positively associated with high Gleason grade and poor relapse-free survival. We engineered prostate-specific Uxt KO mice that developed a hyperplastic phenotype with apparent prostate secretion fluid blockage as well as PIN by 4-6 months. Doubly mutant Uxt KO /Pten KO mice developed a more aggressive PIN phenotype. UXT depletion in prostate cancer cells also increased retroelements expression, including LINE-1 and Alu. Consistent with this finding Uxt KO mice have increased LINE-1 protein levels in the prostate compared to control mice. In addition, cancer cells with UXT depletion have increased retrotransposition activity and accumulated DNA damage.

Purpose:   To compare and evaluate the model fitting uncertainty and error in the model parameter estimation using different DCE-MRI analysis models and to evaluate the ability of the intravascular dispersion parameter to delineate between noncancerous and cancerous prostate tissue in the transition and peripheral zones.  Study type:   Retrospective.  Population:   Fifty-three patients who underwent radical prostatectomy.  Field strength/sequence:   3 T/3D RF-spoiled gradient echo sequence.  Assessment:   The coefficient of variation was used to assess the model fitting uncertainty by adding random noise to the time-concentration curves, and the Akaike information criterion was used to assess the model fitting error. The parametric maps derived from four DCE-MRI analysis models were evaluated by evaluating the delineation between noncancerous tissue and prostate cancer or clinically significant prostate cancer.  Statistical tests:   The receiver operating curve analysis was performed to compare the ability to delineate between noncancerous and prostate cancer tissue in the transition and peripheral zones.  Results:   Both MR dispersion imaging (MRDI) and Weinmann analysis models had the maximum coefficient of variation in different tissue types, while the model fitting uncertainty of modified (m)MRDI was similar to the standard Toft model.

Here, we report a critical role of lncRNA PCAT1 in regulating the PHLPP/FKBP51/IKKα complex and progression of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Using database queries, bioinformatic analyses, as well as RIP and RNA pull-down assays, we discovered and validated that the lncRNA-PCAT1 perturbs the PHLPP/FKBP51/IKKα complex and activates AKT and NF-κB signaling. Expression of lncRNA-PCAT1 is positively linked to CRPC progression. PCAT1 binds directly to FKBP51, displacing PHLPP from the PHLPP/FKBP51/IKKα complex, leading to activation of AKT and NF-κB signaling. Targeting PCAT1 restores PHLPP binding to FKBP1 leading to suppression of AKT signaling. Preclinical study in a mouse model of CRPC suggests therapeutic potential by targeting lncRNA PCAT1 to suppress CRPC progression.

We aimed to evaluate whether docetaxel is active regardless of plasma AR and to perform an exploratory analysis to compare docetaxel with abiraterone/enzalutamide. This multi-institutional study was a pooled analysis of AR status, determined by droplet digital polymerase chain reaction, on pretreatment plasma samples. We evaluated associations between plasma AR and overall/progression-free survival (OS/PFS) and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response rate in 163 docetaxel-treated patients. OS was significantly shorter in case of AR gain (hazard ratio [HR]=1.61, 95% confidence interval [CI]=1.08-2.39, p=0.018), but not PFS (HR=1.04, 95% CI 0.74-1.46, p=0.8) or PSA response (odds ratio=1.14, 95% CI=0.65-1.99, p=0.7). We investigated the interaction between plasma AR and treatment type after incorporating updated data from our prior study of 73 chemotherapy-naïve, abiraterone/enzalutamide-treated patients, with data from 115 first-line docetaxel patients. In an exploratory analysis of mCRPC patients receiving first-line therapies, a significant interaction was observed between plasma AR and docetaxel versus abiraterone/enzalutamide for OS (HR=0.16, 95% CI=0.06-0.46, p<0.001) and PFS (HR=0.31, 95% CI=0.12-0.80, p=0.02). Specifically, we reported a significant difference for OS favoring abiraterone/enzalutamide for AR-normal patients (HR=1.93, 95% CI=1.19-3.12, p=0.008) and a suggestion favoring docetaxel for AR-gained patients (HR=0.53, 95% CI=0.24-1.16, p=0.11). These data suggest that AR-normal patients should receive abiraterone/enzalutamide and AR-gained could benefit from docetaxel. This treatment selection merits prospective evaluation in a randomized trial. PATIENT SUMMARY: We investigated whether plasma androgen receptor (AR) predicted outcome in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) patients treated with docetaxel, and we performed an exploratory analysis in patients treated with docetaxel or AR-directed drugs as first-line mCRPC therapy. We showed that plasma AR normal favored hormonal treatment, whilst plasma AR-gained patients may have had a longer response to docetaxel, suggesting that plasma AR status could be a useful treatment selection biomarker.""","""['Vincenza Conteduca', 'Anuradha Jayaram', 'Nuria Romero-Laorden', 'Daniel Wetterskog', 'Samanta Salvi', 'Giorgia Gurioli', 'Emanuela Scarpi', 'Elena Castro', 'Mercedes Marin-Aguilera', 'Cristian Lolli', 'Giuseppe Schepisi', 'Antonio Maugeri', 'Anna Wingate', 'Alberto Farolfi', 'Valentina Casadio', 'Ana Medina', 'Javier Puente', 'Mª José Méndez Vidal', 'Rafael Morales-Barrera', 'Jose C Villa-Guzmán', 'Susana Hernando', 'Alejo Rodriguez-Vida', 'Aránzazu González-Del-Alba', 'Begoña Mellado', 'Enrique Gonzalez-Billalabeitia', 'David Olmos', 'Gerhardt Attard', 'Ugo De Giorgi']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Eur Urol""","""['Androgen Receptor Splice Variant 7 and Efficacy of Taxane Chemotherapy in Patients With Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Androgen receptor gene status in plasma DNA associates with worse outcome on enzalutamide or abiraterone for castration-resistant prostate cancer: a multi-institution correlative biomarker study.', 'AR-V7 in Peripheral Whole Blood of Patients with Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer: Association with Treatment-specific Outcome Under Abiraterone and Enzalutamide.', 'Treating Patients with Metastatic Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer: A Comprehensive Review of Available Therapies.', 'Efficacy and safety of second-line agents for treatment of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer progressing after docetaxel.

Objectives:   To assess the incidence of metastatic spread in consecutive patients with newly diagnosed cancer, and the potential added value of Ga-PSMA PET/CT to the staging imaging algorithm.  Methods:   Patients with newly diagnosed intermediate- and high-risk prostate cancer were referred for initial staging by Ga-PSMA PET/CT between May 2016 and April 2017. Blood prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels, clinical history, imaging reports and histopathological reports (including Gleason scores) were obtained. Maximal standardized uptake values (SUVmax) were determined for the primary lesions detected within the prostate.  Results:   The study included 137 consecutive patients with intermediate- and high-risk disease who underwent Ga-PSMA PET/CT staging. Of these, 75 had Ga-PSMA uptake in both prostate lobes, 57 had unilateral uptake, and 5 patients had no uptake. SUVmax in the primary tumor correlated significantly with PSA levels. Thirty-five patients had increased uptake compatible with metastatic disease involving lymph nodes, bone, and viscera. Twenty-seven patients had available bone scintigraphy results: 18 (69%) of their 26 bone metastases detected by Ga-PSMA PET/CT were missed on bone scintigraphy.

Methods:   Competing risk survival analyses were used to examine cancer mortality risk in a cohort of 36 441 males aged 35+ years employed in the British rubber industry in 1967, followed up to 2015 (94% mortality). Exposure measurements are based on a population-specific quantitative job-exposure matrix for rubber dust, rubber fumes and N-nitrosamines from the EU-EXASRUB project.  Results:   Exposure (lifetime cumulative (LCE))-response associations were found for N-nitrosomorphiline and all cancers (subdistribution HR (SHR) 1.48, 95% CI 1.39 to 1.57) and cancers of the bladder, stomach, multiple myeloma, oesophagus, prostate and pancreas, as well as for N-nitrosodimethylamine and all cancers (SHR 2.08, 95% CI 1.96 to 2.21) and cancers of the bladder, stomach, leukaemia, multiple myeloma, prostate and liver.

This study reports the initial differences for high dose image guided radiation with or without ADT.  Methods:   From 2012 to 2014, 56 patients were treated with and 60 patients without 6 months of ADT (N = 116) in our phase III randomized trial for intermediate-risk prostate cancer. The primary endpoints of the current analysis are Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC) scores, International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) scores, and bowel or urinary adverse events (AEs, graded using CTCAE v4) with and without ADT. Treatment consisted of 81 Gy in 45 treatments (tx) or 100 Gy Pd-103 implant followed by 45 Gy in 25 tx with or without ADT. Cone-beam fiducial-based guidance was done. Statistical analysis included Fisher's exact test, chi-square test, and ANCOVA.  Results:   Median follow-up for both groups was 2.6 years. Acute or chronic urinary and acute or chronic bowel toxicities were similar with or without ADT (acute urinary: 16 vs 25 G0-1, 39 vs 35 G2 and 1 vs 0 G3, p = 0.17; chronic urinary: 40 vs 45 G1 and 16 vs 15 G2 toxicities, p = 0.68; acute bowel: 56 vs 59 G1 and 0 vs 1 G2 toxicities, p = 0.99; chronic bowel: 56 vs 59 G1 and 0 vs 1 G2 toxicities, p = 0.99).

With the use of ADT, a temporary decline in the EPIC sexual (p = 0.004) and hormonal scores (p = 0.02) were seen for the first 3 to 6 months after the completion of radiation, but the scores recovered by 12 months. Brachytherapy plus external beam radiation was compared to external beam radiation alone; brachytherapy EPIC urinary irritative scores were temporarily lower at 3 months, 76 vs. 84 (p = 0.006), had higher IPSS scores at 3 months, 15 vs 12 (p = 0.01), and had increased acute urinary AEs (p<0.001).

PDA has several architectural patterns, with papillary and cribriform being the most common. The cribriform pattern of acinar carcinoma has shown to be associated with a worse prognosis in terms of disease progression and disease-specific mortality. However, the significance of cribriform pattern in PDA is unknown. In this study, we sought to compare the adverse pathologic features between cribriform-type and non-cribriform-type PDA, and between PDA and acinar carcinoma with Gleason scores 8-10. We identified PDA cases diagnosed between 2008 and 2018 and 428 radical prostatectomy (RP) specimens containing Gleason 8-10 acinar carcinoma. The slides of all PDA cases were reviewed, and pathologic features were recorded. We found that the vast majority of PDA contained admixed acinar carcinoma, with a median percentage of the ductal component of 50% (range 5-100). 29% of PDA was graded as Grade Group 4 and 35.5% as Grade Group 5. At the time of RP, 45.2% of cases presented as pathologic stage T3a and 29% as T3b.

Methods and materials:   Three-dimensional conformal radiation therapy (CRT) and IMRT plans were generated for 10 patients with prostate cancer based on 2 PTV margin protocols (10/8 mm and 6/5 mm) and 2 dose prescriptions (70 Gy and 78 Gy). The normal tissue complication probability (NTCP) for each of the 8 scenarios was calculated using the Lyman-Kutcher-Burman model to estimate the risk of rectal and bladder late toxicity. The conformity and homogeneity indices of PTVs were calculated for each plan.  Results:   The IMRT plans showed superiority in conformity and inferiority in homogeneity over 3-dimensional CRT plans. The rectal NTCPs were increased 3.5 to 4.1 times when the prescribed total dose was changed from 70 Gy to 78 Gy and the dose delivery and the image guided radiation therapy techniques remained unchanged. PTV margin reduction was shown to reduce the value of rectal NTCP significantly. Overall, implementing the IMRT technique alone could reduce the NTCP values only by 2.1% to 7.3% from those of 3-dimensional CRT. The introduction of both IMRT and PTV margin reduction was found to be necessary for rectal NTCP to remain <5% in the dose escalation from 70 to 78 Gy.  Conclusions:   The complementary relationship between the introduction of IMRT and PTV margin reduction was proven.

Methods:   141 prostatectomy specimens from men with localized prostate cancer and known perineural invasion were analyzed. Index tumor blocks were stained for perineural invasion and sympathetic/parasympathetic markers. For 98 patients with complete staining, nerves from up to three hotspot regions of intraprostatic perineural invasion were classified according to autonomic subtype and perineural invasion status. Findings were correlated with prospectively collected clinicopathological data. Biochemical recurrence predictors were tested in univariable and multivariable models.  Results:   Most intra-prostatic nerves contained sympathetic and parasympathetic fibres, irrespective of perineural invasion status.

Objective:   To investigate the impact of persistent PSA at 6wk after RP on long-term oncologic outcomes and to assess patient characteristics associated with persistent PSA.  Design, setting, and participants:   Within a high-volume center database we identified patients who harbored persistent (≥0.1ng/ml) versus undetectable PSA (<0.1ng/ml) at 6wk after RP. Patients with neo- and/or adjuvant androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT) were excluded.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Logistic regression models tested for prediction of persistent PSA. Kaplan-Meier analyses and Cox regression models tested the effect of persistent PSA on metastasis-free survival (MFS), overall survival (OS), and cancer-specific survival (CSS) rates. Propensity score matching (PSM) was performed to test the impact of salvage radiotherapy (SRT) on OS and CSS in patients with persistent PSA.  Results and limitations:   Of 11 604 identified patients, 8.8% (n=1025) harbored persistent PSA. At 15yr after RP, MFS, OS, and CSS were 53.0% versus 93.2% (p<0.001), 64.7% versus 81.2% (p<0.001), and 75.5% versus 96.2% (p<0.001) for persistent versus undetectable PSA, respectively. In multivariable Cox regression models, persistent PSA represented an independent predictor for metastasis (hazard ratio [HR]: 3.59, p<0.001), death (HR: 1.86, p<0.001), and cancer-specific death (HR: 3.15, p<0.001). SRT was associated with improved OS (HR: 0.37, p=0.02) and CSS (HR: 0.12, p<0.01) after 1:1 PSM. Main limitation is missing data on postoperative PSA and duration of salvage ADT.  Conclusions:   Persistent PSA is associated with worse oncologic outcome after RP, namely, metastasis, death, and cancer-specific death. In patients with persistent PSA, SRT resulted in improved OS and CSS.

Methods:   Individuals with negative baseline screening results from the Princess Margaret International Early Lung Cancer Action Program before 2009 underwent low-dose computed tomography rescreening from 2015 to 2018. Individuals were contacted in order of descending risk, as determined by the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial's PLCOM2012 6-year LC risk-prediction model, and then categorized into three risk cohorts according to their baseline risks. The incidence of LC in each risk cohort was determined and compared. Chi-square testing was used for categorical variables and one-way analysis of variance on ranks was used for continuous variables.  Results:   Of the 1261 participants we attempted to re-contact, 359 participants returned for a rescreening scan (mean of 7.6 years between scans). Participants were divided into low (<2%), moderate (≥2% to <3.5%), and high baseline risk (≥3.5%) cohorts. On average, those in the high-risk cohort compared to the moderate- and low-risk cohorts were older (66 years versus 62 and 59 years) and had a greater smoking history (54 pack-years versus 47 and 29 pack-years).

Doxazosin is also being evaluated as a treatment for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and alcoholism, and α1-adrenergic blockers have been linked to neuroprotection in neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Cancer and AD have an inverse relationship in many aspects, with several factors that contribute to apoptosis inhibition and proliferation being increased in cancers but decreased in AD. Neuroblastoma (NB) is a pediatric tumor derived from embryonic neural-crest cells, with an overall cure rate of 40%, despite aggressive treatment. Thus, due to the need of new therapeutic strategies against NB and neurodegenerative disorders and the inverse relationship between these diseases, we investigated whether doxazosin may serve as an antitumor and neuroprotective agent. We analyzed the drug's effects on undifferentiated and retinoic acid-differentiated SH-SY5Y human NB cells and on an in vitro model of organotypic hippocampal cultures exposed to amyloid-β. Doxazosin showed antitumor effect on undifferentiated NB cells by induction of apoptosis, necrosis, cell cycle arrest and decrease of p-EGFRTyr1048 levels. On differentiated cells, doxazosin was less cytotoxic and increased p-EGFRTyr1048, p-AktSer473 and p-GSK-3βSer9 levels. Moreover, the drug was able to protect hippocampal slices from amyloid-β toxicity through prevention of GSK-3β activation and of Tau hyperphosphorylation. Therefore, our results show that doxazosin has antitumor activity against undifferentiated NB and is neuroprotective on an in vitro model of Alzheimer's disease.""","""['Bárbara Paranhos Coelho', 'Mariana Maier Gaelzer', 'Fernanda Dos Santos Petry', 'Juliana Bender Hoppe', 'Vera Maria Treis Trindade', 'Christianne G Salbego', 'Fátima T C R Guma']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Neuroscience""","""[""SLOH, a carbazole-based fluorophore, mitigates neuropathology and behavioral impairment in the triple-transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer's disease."", ""Neuroprotection by association of palmitoylethanolamide with luteolin in experimental Alzheimer's disease models: the control of neuroinflammation."", ""Neuroprotective Effect of SLM, a Novel Carbazole-Based Fluorophore, on SH-SY5Y Cell Model and 3xTg-AD Mouse Model of Alzheimer's Disease."", ""ITH12410/SC058: a new neuroprotective compound with potential in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease."", ""Therapeutic potentials of plant iridoids in Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases: A review."", 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells and Begacestat Mitigate Amyloid-β 25-35-Induced Cognitive Decline in Rat Dams and Hippocampal Deteriorations in Offspring.', 'Bone Marrow-Derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells and γ-Secretase Inhibitor Treatments Suppress Amyloid-β25-35-Induced Cognitive Impairment in Rat Dams and Cortical Degeneration in Offspring.', 'Neurite outgrowth induced by stimulation of angiotensin II AT2 receptors in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells involves c-Src activation.', ""The effect of cerium dioxide nanoparticles on the viability of hippocampal neurons in Alzheimer's disease modeling."", ""Angiotensin II Receptor Blockers Reduce Tau/Aß42 Ratio: A Cerebrospinal Fluid Biomarkers' Case-Control Study.""]"""

Methods and materials:   Patients were treated on a prospective study of single-fraction HDR brachytherapy. All patients had low- or intermediate-risk prostate cancer. Patients with prostate volumes >50 cm3, taking alpha-blockers for urinary symptoms, or with baseline American Urologic Association symptom scores >12 were ineligible. Patients underwent transrectal ultrasound-guided interstitial implant of the prostate followed by single-fraction HDR brachytherapy to a prescription dose of 19 Gy.  Results:   Sixty-eight patients were enrolled with a median follow-up of 3.9 years. Median age was 62 years. Median gland volume at the time of treatment was 35 cm3, 92.6% of patients had T1 disease, 63.2% had a Gleason score of 6, and median pretreatment prostate-specific antigen was 5.0 ng/mL. Chronic grade 2 genitourinary toxicity was 14.7%. No grade 3 urinary toxicity occurred. A single patient experienced grade 2+ rectal toxicity (grade 3 diarrhea) that was transient and resolved with medical management. The 5-year estimated disease-free survival was 77.2% with no significant difference between low- and intermediate-risk patients. A single patient developed distant metastases during the follow-up period. Biopsy-proven local failure at 5 years was 18.8%, occurring at a median interval of 4.0 years posttreatment. No deaths occurred during follow-up.  Conclusions:   With extended follow-up, toxicity rates after single-fraction 19-Gy HDR brachytherapy remain low. Higher-than-expected rates of biochemical and local failure, however, raise concerns regarding the adequacy of this dose. Additional investigation to define the optimal single-fraction HDR brachytherapy dose is warranted, and single-fraction treatment currently should not be offered outside the context of a clinical trial.""","""['Zaid A Siddiqui', 'Gary S Gustafson', 'Hong Ye', 'Alvaro A Martinez', 'Beth Mitchell', 'Evelyn Sebastian', 'Amy Limbacher', 'Daniel J Krauss']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys""","""['Single Fraction High-Dose-Rate Brachytherapy: Too Good to Be True?', 'Favorable Preliminary Outcomes for Men With Low- and Intermediate-risk Prostate Cancer\xa0Treated With 19-Gy Single-fraction High-dose-rate Brachytherapy.', 'MRI-Guided Ultrafocal HDR Brachytherapy for Localized Prostate Cancer: Median 4-Year Results of a feasibility study.', 'Interim report of image-guided conformal high-dose-rate brachytherapy for patients with unfavorable prostate cancer: the William Beaumont phase II dose-escalating trial.', 'Quality of life outcomes after low dose-rate brachytherapy for localized prostate cancer: Current status and future perspectives.', 'High-dose rate brachytherapy as monotherapy in prostate cancer: A systematic review of its safety and efficacy.', 'Safety and efficacy associated with single-fraction high-dose-rate brachytherapy in localized prostate cancer: a\xa0systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Single-fraction high-dose-rate brachytherapy: a scoping review on outcomes and toxicities for all disease sites.', 'Single fraction of HDR brachytherapy for prostate cancer: Results of the SiFEPI phase II prospective trial.', 'Implementation of High-Dose-Rate, CT-Based Prostate Brachytherapy in an Academic Teaching Hospital and Residency Training Program.', 'Assessing the role of external beam radiation therapy in combination with brachytherapy versus brachytherapy alone for unfavorable intermediate-risk prostate cancer.']"""

The in silico docking approach was applied to study the interaction of AER and ENZ with T877A-AR. Through high-performance liquid chromatography, the production of the AER main metabolite Δ4A was studied. AER bound AR in an almost identical manner to that of dihydrotestosterone (DHT). The higher binding energy for AER in T877A-AR could explain the major cytotoxic effect observed in LNCaP cells. The capability of LNCaP cells to synthesize Δ4A could mediate, at least in part, this effect. AER cytotoxicity in LNCaP cells was mainly due to the activation of apoptosis. Further, AER induced modification of AR target gene expression, suggesting a direct effect on AR activity. AER-induced cytotoxicity on PCa cell lines seemed to be mediated by binding with AR.

Our findings also revealed the existence of a CK8+/CK14+ subpopulation in the LNCaP cell line that expresses high levels of both NTSR1 and NTSR3, and displays an enhanced susceptibility to develop neuroendocrine-like phenotypes upon treatment with NTS.

Purpose:   To optimize an acquisition and postprocessing protocol for 3.0 T multipool CEST analysis of prostate data and evaluate the repeatability of the technique.  Study type:   Prospective.  Subjects:   Five healthy volunteers (age range: 24-47 years; median age: 28 years) underwent two sessions (interval range: 7-27 days; median interval: 20 days) and two biopsy-proven prostate cancer patients were evaluated once. Patient 1 (71 years) had a Gleason 3 + 4 transition zone (TZ) tumor and patient 2 (55 years) had a Gleason 4 + 3 peripheral zone (PZ) tumor.  Field strength:   3.0 T. Sequences run: T2 -weighted turbo-spin-echo (TSE); diffusion-weighted imaging; CEST; WASABI (for B0 determination).  Assessment:   Saturation, readout, and fit-model parameters were optimized to maximize in vivo amide and nuclear Overhauser effect (NOE) signals. Repeatability (intrasession and intersession) was evaluated in healthy volunteers. Subsequently, preliminary evaluation of signal differences was made in patients. Regions of interest were drawn by two post-FRCR board-certified readers, both with over 5 years of experience in multiparametric prostate MRI.  Statistical tests:   Repeatability was assessed using Bland-Altman analysis, coefficient of variation (CV), and 95% limits of agreement (LOA). Statistical significance of CEST contrast was calculated using a nonparametric Mann-Whitney U-test.  Results:   The optimized saturation scheme was found to be 60 sinc-Gaussian pulses with 40 msec pulse duration, at 50% duty-cycle with continuous-wave pulse equivalent B1 power (B1CWPE ) of 0.92 μT. The magnetization transfer (MT) contribution to the fit-model was centered at -1.27 ppm.

While these intensified regimens have improved efficacy, they are also associated with increased cost and toxicities. Not all men with mHSPC may be candidates for these intensified regimens, yet there are no clinical models or biomarkers used to optimize treatment selection. Herein, we hypothesized that longer time from prior definitive therapy (DT), either radical prostatectomy, definitive radiotherapy, or both, to onset of metastatic disease is associated with improved survival outcomes in men with newly diagnosed mHSPC.  Methods:   This multicenter retrospective study included men initiating systemic therapy with ADT for new mHSPC. Kaplan-Meier and COX proportional hazard models assessed time to metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) and overall survival (OS) by receipt of prior DT.  Results:   Of the 253 men with new mHSPC, 115 (45%) had received prior DT. In a multivariate analysis, increasing years from DT to the start of ADT was an independent predictor of time to mCRPC (per year: hazard ratio 0.91 95% confidence interval 0.84-0.99, P = 0.020) and improved OS (per year: hazard ratio 0.87, 95% confidence interval 0.74-0.99, P = 0.0025) in patients with new mHSPC, and may assist with risk stratification in these patients at time of mHSPC.

Materials and methods:   This was a population-based cohort study, using data from linked, validated health administrative databases, of all Ontario-based men with a negative first biopsy between January 1994 and October 2014. Patients were followed from time of first biopsy till death, administrative censoring, or end of study period. Cumulative incidence functions were used to calculate the study outcomes' cumulative incidences. Univariable and multivariable regression analyses using Fine and Gray's semiparametric proportional hazards model were used to assess predictors of prostate cancer diagnosis and mortality.  Results:   The study cohort included 95,675 men with a median age of 63.0years. Median follow-up was 8.1years. The 20-year cumulative rates of prostate cancer-specific mortality and diagnosis were 1.8% and 23.7%, respectively. Men ages 70 to 79 and 80 to 84 at initial biopsy had 20-year prostate cancer-specific mortality cumulative rates of 3.2% and 6.4% respectively. The 20-year cumulative rate of receiving radical prostatectomy was 7.6%. Higher socioeconomic status and urban residence were associated with higher diagnosis risks yet lower prostate cancer-specific mortality risks.  Conclusions:   This is the first population-based study assessing long-term cancer outcomes in North American men with a single negative transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy.

Here, we report the results of patient-reported outcomes of this study.  Methods:   In the randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 PROSPER trial, done at 254 study sites worldwide, patients aged 18 years or older with non-metastatic, castration-resistant prostate cancer and a prostate-specific antigen doubling time of up to 10 months were randomly assigned (2:1) via an interactive voice web recognition system to receive oral enzalutamide (160 mg per day) or placebo. Randomisation was stratified by prostate-specific antigen doubling time and baseline use of a bone-targeting agent. The primary endpoint was metastasis-free survival, reported elsewhere. Secondary efficacy endpoints, reported here, were pain progression (assessed by the Brief Pain Inventory Short Form [BPI-SF] questionnaire) and health-related quality of life (assessed with the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire [EORTC QLQ-PR25], the EuroQoL 5-Dimensions 5-Levels health questionnaire visual analogue scale [EQ-5D-FL, EQ-VAS], and the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Prostate [FACT-P] questionnaires). Patients completed questionnaires at baseline, week 17, and every 16 weeks thereafter until treatment discontinuation. We used predefined questionnaire thresholds to identify clinically meaningful changes. Enrolment for PROSPER is complete and follow-up continues. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02003924.  Findings:   Between Nov 26, 2013, and June 28, 2017, 1401 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to receive enzalutamide (n=933) or placebo (n=468). Median follow-up was 18·5 months (IQR 10·7-29·2) in the enzalutamide group and 15·1 months (7·4-25·9) in the placebo group. Patient-reported outcome scores at baseline were similar between groups. Changes in least squares mean from baseline to week 97 favoured enzalutamide versus placebo for FACT-P social and family wellbeing (0·30 [95% CI -0·25 to 0·85] vs -0·64 [-1·51 to 0·24]; difference 0·94 [95% CI 0·02 to 1·85]; p=0·045) and disfavoured enzalutamide versus placebo for EORTC QLQ-PR25 hormonal treatment-related symptoms (1·55 [0·26 to 2·83) vs -1·83 [-3·86 to 0·20]; difference 3·38 [1·24 to 5·51]; p=0·0020); neither of these changes were clinically meaningful. No significant differences were observed between treatments for changes from baseline to week 97 in any other patient-reported outcome score. Time to clinically meaningful pain progression as assessed by BPI-SF pain severity was longer with enzalutamide than with placebo (median 36·83 months, [95% CI 34·69 to not reached [NR] vs NR; hazard ratio [HR] 0·75 [95% CI 0·57 to 0·97]; p=0·028); there was no significant difference for BPI-SF item 3 or pain interference. Time to clinically meaningful symptom worsening was longer with enzalutamide than with placebo for EORTC QLQ-PR25 urinary symptoms (median 36·86 months [95% CI 33·35 to NR] vs 25·86 [18·53 to 29·47]; HR 0·58 [95% CI 0·46 to 0·72]; p<0·0001) and bowel symptoms (33·15 [29·50 to NR] vs 25·89 [18·43 to 29·67]; 0·72 [0·59 to 0·89]; p=0·0018), and clinically meaningful health-related quality of life as assessed by FACT-P total score (22·11 [18·63 to 25·86] vs 18·43 [14·85-19·35]; 0·83 [0·69 to 0·99]; p=0·037), emotional wellbeing (36·73 [33·12 to 38·21] vs 29·47 [22·18 to 33·15]; 0·69 [0·55 to 0·86]; p=0·0008), and prostate cancer subscale (18·43 [14·85 to 18·66] vs 14·69 [11·07 to 16·20]; 0·79 [0·67 to 0·93]; p=0·0042), although there was no significant difference for other FACT-P scores. Time to clinically meaningful deterioration in EORTC QLQ-PR25 hormonal treatment-related symptoms was shorter with enzalutamide than with placebo (median 33·15 months [95% CI 29·60 to NR] vs 36·83 [29·47 to NR]; HR 1·29 [95% CI 1·02 to 1·63]; p=0·035). Time to deterioration of EQ-VAS was significantly longer for enzalutamide than for placebo (median 22·11 months [95% CI 18·46 to 25·66] vs 14·75 [11·07 to 18·17]; HR 0·75 [95% CI 0·63 to 0·90]; p=0·0013).  Interpretation:   Patients with non-metastatic, castration-resistant prostate cancer receiving enzalutamide had longer metastasis-free survival than did those who received placebo, while maintaining low pain levels and prostate cancer symptom burden and high health-related quality of life. Enzalutamide showed a clinical benefit by delaying pain progression, symptom worsening, and decrease in functional status, compared with placebo. These findings suggest that enzalutamide is a treatment option that should be discussed with patients presenting with high-risk, non- metastatic, castration-resistant prostate cancer.

Methods:   A previously developed model for stray radiation of the primary beam was improved and used to calculate the photon dose and photon energy in the out-of-field region for a radiotherapy patient. The dose calculated by the treatment planning system was fused with the model-calculated out-of-field dose, resulting in a whole-body photon dose distribution. The peripheral neutron dose equivalent was calculated using an analytical model from the literature. A daily cone beam CT dose was added to the neutron and photon dose equivalents. The calculated 3D dose distributions were compared to independent measurements conducted with thermoluminescence dosimeters and an anthropomorphic phantom. The dose contributions from the IGRT treatments of three different techniques applied with two nominal X-ray energies were compared using dose equivalent volume histograms (DEVHs).  Results:   The calculated and measured out-of-field whole-body dose equivalents for the IGRT treatments agreed within (9 ± 10) % (mean and type A SD). The neutron dose equivalent was a minor contribution to the total out-of-field dose up to 50 cm from the isocenter. Further from the isocenter, head leakage was dominating inside the patient body, whereas the neutron dose equivalent contribution was important close to the surface. There were small differences between the whole-body DEVHs of the 6 and 15 MV treatments applied with the same technique, although the single scatter contributions showed large differences. Independent of the beam energy, the out-of-field dose of the volumetric-modulated arc therapy (VMAT) treatment was significantly lower than the dynamic intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) treatment.  Conclusion:   The calculated whole-body dose helped to understand the importance of the dose contributions in different areas of the patient. Regarding radiation protection of the patient for IGRT treatments, the choice of beam energy is not important, whereas the treatment technique has a large influence on the out-of-field dose. If the patient is treated with intensity-modulated beams, VMAT should be used instead of dynamic IMRT in terms of radiation protection of the patient. In general, the developed models for photon and neutron dose equivalent calculation can be used for any patient geometry, tumor location, and linear accelerator.""","""['Pascal Hauri', 'Uwe Schneider']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""J Appl Clin Med Phys""","""['In vivo and phantom measurements of the secondary photon and neutron doses for prostate patients undergoing 18 MV IMRT.', 'Constituent components of out-of-field scatter dose for 18-MV intensity modulated radiation therapy versus 3-dimensional conformal radiation therapy: a comparison with 6-MV and implications for carcinogenesis.', 'Out-of-field photon and neutron dose equivalents from step-and-shoot intensity-modulated radiation therapy.', ""Dose to normal tissues outside the radiation therapy patient's treated volume: a review of different radiation therapy techniques."", 'Intensity-modulated radiotherapy: current status and issues of interest.', 'Feasibility and Toxicity of Full-Body Volumetric Modulated Arc Therapy Technique for High-Dose Total Body Irradiation.', 'Analytical models for external photon beam radiotherapy out-of-field dose calculation: a scoping review.', 'Neutron dose from a 6-MV X-ray beam in radiotherapy.', 'Influence of Specific Treatment Parameters on Nontarget and Out-of-Field Doses in a Phantom Model of Prostate SBRT with CyberKnife and TrueBeam.', 'Development of whole-body representation and dose calculation in a commercial treatment planning system.']"""

However, the dynamic nature of VMAT results in a large-scale nonconvex optimization problem. Determining the priority of the tissues and voxels to obtain clinically acceptable treatment plans poses additional challenges for VMAT optimization. The main purpose of this paper is to develop an automatic planning approach integrating dose-volume histogram (DVH) criteria in direct aperture optimization for VMAT, by adjusting the model parameters during the algorithm. The proposed algorithm is based on column generation, an optimization technique that sequentially generates the apertures and optimizes the corresponding intensities. We take the advantage of iterative procedure in this method to modify the weight vector of the penalty function based on the DVH criteria and decrease the use of trial-and-error in the search for clinically acceptable plans. We evaluate the efficiency of the algorithm and treatment quality using a clinical prostate case and a challenging head-and-neck case. In both cases, we generate 15 random initial weight vectors to assess the robustness of the algorithm. In the prostate case, our methodology obtained clinically acceptable plans in all instances with only a 10% increase in the computational time, while simple VMAT optimization found just three acceptable plans. To have an idea with respect to the existing software, we compared the obtained DVH to a commercial software. The quality of the diagrams of the proposed method, especially for the healthy tissues, is significantly better while the computational time is less. In the head-and-neck case, 93.3% of the clinically acceptable plans are obtained while no plan was acceptable in simple VMAT. In sum, the results demonstrate the ability of the proposed optimization algorithm to obtain clinically acceptable plans without human intervention and also its robustness to weight parameters. Moreover, our proposed weight adjustment procedure proves to reduce the symmetry in the solution space and the time required for the post-optimization phase.""","""['Mehdi Mahnam', 'Michel Gendreau', 'Nadia Lahrichi', 'Louis-Martin Rousseau']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Phys Med Biol""","""['A comprehensive formulation for volumetric modulated arc therapy planning.', 'Multi-GPU implementation of a VMAT treatment plan optimization algorithm.', 'Multicriteria optimization informed VMAT planning.', 'Ultrafast treatment plan optimization for volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT).', 'Artificial intelligence applications in intensity modulated radiation treatment planning: an overview.']"""

Different levels of resistance lead to observed heterogeneity in treatment response. The main goal was to evaluate treatment response heterogeneity with a computation model simulating the dynamics of drug-sensitive and drug-resistant cells. Model parameters included proliferation, drug-induced death, transition and proportion of intrinsically resistant cells. The model was benchmarked with imaging metrics extracted from 39 metastatic prostate cancer patients who had 18F-NaF-PET/CT scans performed at baseline and at three cycles into chemotherapy or hormonal therapy. Two initial model assumptions were evaluated: considering only inter-patient heterogeneity and both inter-patient and intra-patient heterogeneity in the proportion of intrinsically resistant cells. The correlation between the median proportion of intrinsically resistant cells and baseline patient-level imaging metrics was assessed with Spearman's rank correlation coefficient. The impact of model parameters on simulated treatment response was evaluated with a sensitivity study. Treatment response after periods of six, nine, and 12 months was predicted with the model. The median predicted range of response for patients treated with both therapies was compared with a Wilcoxon rank sum test. For each patient, the time was calculated when the proportion of disease with a non-favourable response outperformed a favourable response. By taking into account inter-patient and intra-patient heterogeneity in the proportion of intrinsically resistant cells, the model performed significantly better ([Formula: see text]) than by taking into account only inter-patient heterogeneity ([Formula: see text]). The median proportion of intrinsically resistant cells showed a moderate correlation (ρ = 0.55) with mean patient-level uptake, and a low correlation (ρ = 0.36) with the dispersion of mean metastasis-level uptake in a patient. The sensitivity study showed a strong impact of the proportion of intrinsically resistant cells on model behaviour after three cycles of therapy. The difference in the median range of response (MRR) was not significant between cohorts at any time point (p > 0.15). The median time when the proportion of disease with a non-favourable response outperformed the favourable response was eight months, for both cohorts. The model provides an insight into inter-patient and intra-patient heterogeneity in the evolution of treatment resistance.""","""['Maruša Turk', 'Urban Simončič', 'Alison Roth', 'Damijan Valentinuzzi', 'Robert Jeraj']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Phys Med Biol""","""['More advantages in detecting bone and soft tissue metastases from prostate cancer using 18F-PSMA PET/CT.', 'A Prospective Comparison of 18F-Sodium Fluoride PET/CT and PSMA-Targeted 18F-DCFBC PET/CT in Metastatic Prostate Cancer.', 'Quantitative Assessment of Early 18FSodium Fluoride Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography Response to Treatment in Men With Metastatic Prostate Cancer to Bone.', '18F-NaF-PET/CT and 99mTc-MDP Bone Scintigraphy in the Detection of Bone Metastases in Prostate Cancer.', '¹⁸F-NaF PET/CT and ¹¹C-Choline PET/CT for the initial detection of metastatic disease in prostate cancer: overview and potential utilization.']"""

Here, we evaluated the tumorigenic activities of PPIs in vitro, in PCa cell lines and epithelial cells from benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and in vivo, in PCa mice xenografts. PPIs increased survival and proliferation, and inhibited apoptosis in LNCaP cells. These effects were attenuated or absent in androgen-insensitive DU-145 and PC3 cells, respectively. Specifically, omeprazole (OME) promoted cell cycle progression, increased c-Myc expression, ErbB2 activity and PSA secretion. Furthermore, OME induced the phosphorylation of MAPK-ERK1/2, PI3K/Akt and GSK-3β, and blunted the expression and activity of cellular prostatic acid phosphatase. OME also increased survival, proliferation and PSA levels in BPH cells. In vivo, OME promoted tumor growth in mice bearing LNCaP xenografts.

Results:   181 subjects were offered enrollment; 133 agreed to participate. 65 subjects were randomized to the ""Internet- first"" group and 68 subjects to the ""phone-first"" group. Of these, 37 and 26 subjects respectively completed both questionnaire versions (response rate: 44.4%). Test-retest analysis showed significant intraclass correlations in all 5 domains of EPIC-26: urinary incontinence (r = 0.96), urinary irritation (r = 0.85), bowel function (r = 0.61), sexual function (r = 0.94), and hormonal function (r = 0.89). There was no effect of order of questionnaire administration.  Conclusion:   This study demonstrates excellent correlation of responses between Internet-based and phone-based EPIC-26 administration. All domains demonstrated test-retest reliability between modalities, without ordering effect. This validates the use of internet-based EPIC-26 in international registries as part of the International Consortium for Health Outcomes Measurement effort, and may facilitate its use in clinical practice and quality improvement.""","""['David J Einstein', 'Dattatraya Patil', 'Jonathan Chipman', 'Meredith M Regan', 'Kyle Davis', 'Catrina M Crociani', 'Andrew A Wagner', 'Martin G Sanda', 'Peter Chang']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Urology""","""['Cross-cultural adaptation and validation of the French version of the Expanded Prostate cancer Index Composite questionnaire for health-related quality of life in prostate cancer patients.', 'Development and validation of the expanded prostate cancer index composite (EPIC) for comprehensive assessment of health-related quality of life in men with prostate cancer.', 'Development and validation of an abbreviated version of the expanded prostate cancer index composite instrument for measuring health-related quality of life among prostate cancer survivors.', 'Patient-reported outcome (PRO) questionnaires for men who have radical surgery for prostate cancer: a conceptual review of existing instruments.', 'A systematic review of expanded prostate cancer index composite (EPIC) quality of life after surgery or radiation treatment.', 'Robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy: learning curves and outcomes from an Australian perspective.', 'Assessing the Impact of Decision Aid Use on Post Prostatectomy Patient Reported Outcomes.', 'Salvage radiation therapy in prostate cancer: relationship between rectal dose and long-term, self-reported rectal bleeding.']"""

The etiology of this disease and effective therapy for its treatment are yet to be elucidated. We investigated the functions of XLQ® in chronic nonbacterial prostatitis using a complete Freund's adjuvant-induced rat model. Prostates and blood samples were collected for further evaluation after oral gavage with XLQ ® or a vehicle for 4 weeks. The results showed that XLQ ® significantly decreased the prostate index, ameliorated the histopathologic changes, and reduced CD3+ and CD45+ cell infiltration in the prostate stroma. Further study showed that XLQ ® suppressed the expression of proinflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IL-17A, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, and tumor necrosis factor-α. XLQ ® showed a strong antioxidant capacity by enhancing the activities of antioxidative enzymes (e.g., total superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase) and decreasing the level of lipid peroxidation products (malondialdehyde). Moreover, XLQ ® can suppress the activation of nuclear factor-κB and P38-mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathways. In summary, XLQ ® has affirmative effects on chronic prostatitis, which could be attributed to its anti-inflammatory and antioxidative capacities. On the basis of these results, XLQ ® can be developed as an effective and safe therapy for chronic prostatitis.""","""['Feiya Yang', 'Lingquan Meng', 'Panpan Han', 'Dexi Chen', 'Mingshuai Wang', 'Yongguang Jiang', 'Yanqiao Wu', 'Yiling Wu', 'Nianzeng Xing']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""J Cell Physiol""","""['The effect of pirfenidone on rat chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome and its mechanisms.', 'Quercetin protects against chronic prostatitis in rat model through NF-κB and MAPK signaling pathways.', 'Anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effect of modified Bazhengsan in a rat model of chronic bacterial prostatitis.', 'Inflammatory mechanisms and oxidative stress in prostatitis: the possible role of antioxidant therapy.', 'Treatment response to conventional and novel therapies in chronic prostatitis.', 'Relationship between pyroptosis-mediated inflammation and the pathogenesis of prostate disease.', 'Network Pharmacology and Molecular Docking Verify the Mechanism of Qinshi Simiao San in Treating Chronic Prostatitis in the Rat Model.', 'Effect of thermophilic bacterium HB27 manganese superoxide dismutase in a rat model of chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CP/CPPS).', 'Extracellular vesicles released from hiPSC-derived MSCs attenuate chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome in rats by immunoregulation.', 'Single-cell multi-omics analysis presents the landscape of peripheral blood T-cell subsets in human chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome.']"""

We assessed outcomes after sRP in a series of patients with localized PCa and that had received radiation therapy or HIFU as a first-line treatment.  Materials and methods:   Data from nine French referral centers on patients treated with sRP between 2005 and 2017 were collected. Pre- and post-operative data, including oncological and functional outcomes after first treatment and sRP, were analyzed to determine the predictors for biochemical recurrence (BCR) and cancer-specific survival (CSS) after sRP.  Results:   First-line treatments were external beam-radiation therapy (EBRT) for 30 (55%), brachytherapy (BT) for 10 (18%), and high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) for 15 (27%). Median (IQR) PSA at diagnosis was 6.4 (4.9-9.5) ng/mL, median PSA at nadir was 1.9 (0.7-3.0) ng/mL, and median (IQR) to first BCR was 13 (6-20) months. Of the 55 patients, 44 (80%) received robot-assisted salvage radical prostatectomy and 11 (20%) received salvage retropubic radical prostatectomy. Restoration of continence was achieved in 90% of preoperatively continent patients; 24% that had received nerve-sparing (NS) procedures were potent after surgery. Prolonged catheterization due to anastomotic leakage was the most common complication. Age, preoperative clinical stage, NS procedure, and a pathological Gleason score were predictors for BCR.  Conclusions:   sRP was safe, feasible, and effective using either an open or robot-assisted approach, in experienced hands.

Diagnosis of incident cancer may impede management of CAD, thereby increasing the risk of CAD-related complications and associated healthcare expenditures. This study examined the relationship between incident cancer and CAD-related expenditures among elderly Medicare beneficiaries. Patients and Methods: A retrospective longitudinal study was conducted using the SEER-Medicare linked registries and a 5% noncancer random sample of Medicare beneficiaries. Elderly fee-for-service Medicare beneficiaries with preexisting CAD and with incident breast, colorectal, or prostate cancer (N=12,095) or no cancer (N=34,237) were included. CAD-related healthcare expenditures comprised Medicare payments for inpatient, home healthcare, and outpatient services. Expenditures were measured every 120 days during the 1-year preindex and 1-year postindex periods. Adjusted relationship between incident cancer and expenditures was analyzed using the generalized linear mixed models. Results: Overall, CAD-related mean healthcare expenditures in the preindex period accounted for approximately 32.6% to 39.5% of total expenditures among women and 41.5% to 46.8% among men. All incident cancer groups had significantly higher CAD-related expenditures compared with noncancer groups (P<.0001). Men and women with colorectal cancer (CRC) had 166% and 153% higher expenditures, respectively, compared with their noncancer counterparts.

Consequences of cell line mischaracterization include squandered resources and publication retractions.  Methods:   We calculated genetic ancestry proportions for 15 cell lines to assess the accuracy of previous race/ethnicity classification and determine previously unknown estimates. DNA was extracted from cell lines and genotyped for ancestry informative markers representing West African (WA), Native American (NA), and European (EUR) ancestry.  Results:   Of the cell lines tested, all previously classified as White/Caucasian were accurately described with mean EUR ancestry proportions of 97%. Cell lines previously classified as Black/African American were not always accurately described. For instance, the 22Rv1 prostate cancer cell line was recently found to carry mixed genetic ancestry using a much smaller panel of markers. However, our more comprehensive analysis determined the 22Rv1 cell line carries 99% EUR ancestry. Most notably, the E006AA-hT prostate cancer cell line, classified as African American, was found to carry 92% EUR ancestry. We also determined the MDA-MB-468 breast cancer cell line carries 23% NA ancestry, suggesting possible Afro-Hispanic/Latina ancestry.  Conclusions:   Our results suggest predominantly EUR ancestry for the White/Caucasian-designated cell lines, yet high variance in ancestry for the Black/African American-designated cell lines. In addition, we revealed an extreme misclassification of the E006AA-hT cell line.  Impact:   Genetic ancestry estimates offer more sophisticated characterization leading to better contextualization of findings.

However, its biological role in this malignancy has not been clarified yet. In the present study, we performed SFRP5 overexpression experiments to determine its function in prostate cancer cell growth, invasion, tumorigenesis, and docetaxel sensitivity. Our results showed that overexpression of SFRP5 significantly suppressed the proliferation and colony formation of PC-3 and DU-145 cells, compared with vector-transfected control cells. SFRP5 overexpression arrested PC-3 and DU-145 cells at G0/G1 phase and induced apoptosis. Transwell invasion assay revealed that ectopic expression of SFRP5 inhibited the invasion of PC-3 cells. Overexpression of SFRP5 resensitized docetaxel-resistant PC-3 and DU-145 cells to docetaxel, which was coupled with increased apoptosis. Mechanistically, SFRP5 overexpression blocked β-catenin nuclear translocation and transcriptional activity. In vivo studies confirmed that overexpression of SFRP5 significantly suppressed the growth of PC-3 xenograft tumors. SFRP5-transfected xenograft tumors showed a reduction in the percentage of Ki-67-positive proliferating cells and an increase in terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferasebiotin-dUTP nick end labeling-positive cells. These data suggest that SFRP5 overexpression suppresses the aggressive phenotype of prostate cancer cells and overcomes docetaxel resistance through inactivation of β-catenin signaling.

Methods: Between May 2017 and March 2018, 142 consecutive patients with prior negative transrectal biopsy results and persistently elevated prostate-specific antigen (PSA) were divided into the observation group and the control group randomly. The observation group underwent TTMB and the control group underwent transperineal template-guided prostate saturation biopsy (TTSB). Bleeding, infection, urinary function were recorded after prostate biopsy. Erectile function (ED) was measured at baseline, 1 month, 3 months and 6 months after prostate biopsy using the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF-5). Results: A mean of 59 cores (from 33 to 116 cores) were obtained in TTMB, and a mean of 23 cores (from 11 to 44 cores) were obtained in TTSB. The positive rate was 50.0% (30/60) in TTMB, and 32.9% (27/82) in TTSB, and there were significant differences between two groups (P<0.05). The incidence of severe hematuria and urinary retention was 8.3% (5/60) and 11.7% (7/60) respectively in TTMB, while 1.2% (1/60) and 11.7% (7/60) respectively in TTSB. There were significant differences between two groups (P<0.05). But there were no significant differences between two groups in the incidence of mild, moderate and total hematuria, hematospermia, perineal hematoma, infection (P>0.05). Rectal bleeding was not observed. In TTMB group, the IIEF-5 scores at baseline, 1 month, 3 months and 6 months were (19.1±4.5), (17.4±4.8), (18.6±4.5), (19.0±4.0), respectively. In TTSB group, the IIEF-5 scores at baseline, 1 month, 3 months and 6 months were (19.7±4.3), (18.2±4.5), (19.1±4.1), (19.6±4.2), respectively. There were significant differences between baseline and 1 month after prostate biopsy in two groups (P<0.05), but there were no significant differences of IIEF-5 score between the two groups (P>0.05). Conclusions: TTMB can improve the positive rate for patients with prior negative transrectal biopsy results and persistently elevated PSA. TTMB has low complication rates, and most side-effects are self-limited. Compared with TTSB, the incidence of urinary retention and severe hematuria increases, but they can be recovered after clinical intervention.

Through fi ve-trocars transperitoneal access, we perform a longitudinal incision of the bladder wall and prostate capsule. Our technique of RASP is very similar to the standard operative technique described during laparoscopic and robotic removal of adenoma, however, for reconstruction, we propose the Tunnel-Shaped Trigonization (TST). The fi rst step is the advancement of a bladder mucosa fl ap until the posterior part of the prostatic urethra. The second step, a running suture between the advanced mucosa and the prostatic capsule is done bilaterally. At this point, the prostate capsule should be totally isolated from the rest of the urinary tract. Finally, the third step is closing both sides of the capsule and bladder mucosa anteriorly identical to a tunnel conformation. Hiding the prostatic capsule optimizes the patient recovery since hematuria is the most related factor for hospital stay length. This pilot-case has shown satisfactory results without the need for continuous bladder irrigation. The prostate volume in the TRUS was 130 cm3 and the preoperative International Prostate Symptom score was 24. He was discharged at second postoperative day and no late complications were detected. In conclusion, the TST-RASP seems to be a safe and feasible modifi cation of the RASP.

Materials and methods:   This feasibility study included two steps. First we enabled realtime, secure bidirectional data exchange between the mobile app and EHR for 14 data elements, and second we pilot tested the production environment app with 9 primary care patients aged 60-65 years. Our primary usability metric was a net promoter score (NPS), based on users' recommendation of the app to a friend or family member; we also assessed the proportion of users who 1) updated their prostate cancer risk factor information present in the EHR and 2) submitted more than one unique response regarding their preference to have PSA testing.  Results:   The seven web services necessary to read and write data required considerable configuration, but successfully delivered risk factor-specific educational content and recorded patients' values and decision preference directly within the EHR. Seven of the 9 patients (78%) would recommend this app to a friend/family member (NPS = 55.6%), one patient used the app to update risk factor information, and 4/9 (44%) changed their decision preference while using the app.  Conclusions:   It is feasible to implement a decision aid directly into users' standard EHR workflow for limited usability testing.

Scientists have tried to prepare bimodal reporters by combining fluorescent dyes with metal nanomaterials, but their fluorescence was easily quenched by metal nanomaterials through surface energy transfer, making dual colorimetric and fluorometric ICTS very difficult to be achieved. As compared to conventional fluorescent probes, semiconducting polymer dots (Pdots) exhibit extraordinary fluorescence brightness and facile surface functionalization, which are very suitable to be engineered as bimodal signal reporting reagents. Here, we integrated highly fluorescent Pdots with strongly plasmonic Au nanorods to form Pdot-Au hybrid nanocomposites with dual colorimetric and fluorescent readout abilities. We further utilized these nanohybrids in ICTS for qualitatively fast screening (colorimetry) as well as quantitatively accurate determination (fluorometry) of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) within 10 min. By taking advantage of the plasmon-enhanced fluorescence of Pdots on Au nanorods, this immunoassay possesses much better detection sensitivity of 1.07 pg/mL for PSA, which is at least 2 orders of magnitude lower than that of conventional fluorometric ICTS. Moreover, the direct detection of PSA from human whole blood collected without sample pretreatment makes this Pdot-based ICTS platform promising for on-site point-of-care diagnostics.""","""['Pei-Yun You', 'Fang-Chu Li', 'Ming-Ho Liu', 'Yang-Hsiang Chan']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""ACS Appl Mater Interfaces""","""['Bimodal Multiplexed Detection of Tumor Markers in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer with Polymer Dot-Based Immunoassay.', 'Multiplexed Detection of Tumor Markers with Multicolor Polymer Dot-Based Immunochromatography Test Strip.', 'FRET-Created Traffic Light Immunoassay Based on Polymer Dots for PSA Detection.', 'Highly fluorescent semiconducting polymer dots for biology and medicine.', 'Recent Developments in Semiconducting Polymer Dots for Analytical Detection and NIR-II Fluorescence Imaging.', 'Ag NC and Ag NP/PorC Film-Based Surface-Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy-Type Immunoassay for Ultrasensitive Prostate-Specific Antigen Detection.', 'Semiconducting Polymer Dots for Point-of-Care Biosensing and In Vivo Bioimaging: A Concise Review.', 'Plasmonic Modes and Fluorescence Enhancement Coupling Mechanism: A Case with a Nanostructured Grating.', 'Portable Plasmonic Paper-Based Biosensor for Simple and Rapid Indirect Detection of CEACAM5 Biomarker via Metal-Enhanced Fluorescence.', 'Current Advances in Paper-Based Biosensor Technologies for Rapid COVID-19 Diagnosis.']"""

Consequently, there is an urgent need to explore novel molecular mechanisms underlying treatment resistance in ADPC. Although numerous studies have alluded to the role of miR-200a in several cancers, the biological significance of miR-200a in prostate cancer remains unknown. After performing microarray analysis and reanalysis of the publicly available Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center dataset, miR-200a expression was found higher in ADPC tissues and its expression was positively associated with survival of CRPC patients. In vitro studies showed that miR-200a overexpression in CRPC cells markedly suppressed cellular proliferation and facilitated apoptosis.

Prospective data collection was undertaken in 86 consecutive men who underwent robotically assisted transperineal prostate biopsy. All underwent a multi-parametric MRI pre-biopsy with centroid targeting followed by systematic template prostate biopsy. For the purposes of this study, our definition of clinically significant prostate cancer (csPCa) is any Gleason score > 6. Mean (SD) age, median (IQR) PSA, and median (IQR) prostate volume were 64.24 (6.97) years, of 7.79 ng/ml (6.5) and 45.06 cc (28), respectively. Overall, 44 (51.2%) men were diagnosed with csPCa. csPCa was detected in the targeted biopsies alone in 35 (40.1%) men. The addition of the 12-zone template biopsy increased the yield of csPCa for another 9 (10.5%) men. Of these 9 men, the majority (7) harbored primary pattern 3 disease and only 1 was identified to have high-grade disease. Out of these 9 men, 7 of them had the identification of csPCa in the sector, where a target was contained within that zone. Robotic-assisted prostate biopsy in our study has demonstrated a high detection of csPCa when combined with limited near-field sampling. Our study suggests the use of more accurate biopsy schemes such as ring-targeting of lesions to mitigate against systematic and random mathematical errors.

Yet, RCS are understudied. The Reach-out to ENhancE Wellness(RENEW) trial, a home-based, diet and exercise intervention among 641 breast, prostate, and colorectal cancer survivors addressed many of these challenges.  Methods:   We examined whether rural and urban participants differed in their response to the RENEW intervention (e.g., physical functioning, quality-of-life, intakes of fruits and vegetables (F&V) and saturated fat, body mass index(BMI), physical activity, and adverse events).  Results:   Rural versus urban survivors report significantly more favorable mean (SE) changes in physical functioning [- 0.66 (1.47) v - 1.71 (1.00)], physical health [+ 0.14 (0.71) v - 0.74 (0.50)], and fewer adverse events [1.58 (0.08) v 1.64 (0.06)]. Rural versus urban survivors reported smaller increases in F&Vs [+ 1.47 (0.23) v + 1.56(0.16); p = 0.018], and lower percentages achieved goal behavior for endurance exercise and intakes of F&Vs and saturated fat.  Conclusions:   The RENEW intervention reduced declines in physical health and functioning among RCS to a significantly greater extent than for urban cancer survivors. All survivors significantly improved intakes of F&V and saturated fat, and endurance exercise; however, lower percentages of rural versus urban survivors met goal suggesting that more intensive interventions may be needed for RCS.""","""['Marquita S Gray', 'Suzanne E Judd', 'Richard Sloane', 'Denise C Snyder', 'Paige E Miller', 'Wendy Demark-Wahnefried']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Cancer Causes Control""","""['Dietary patterns differ between urban and rural older, long-term survivors of breast, prostate, and colorectal cancer and are associated with body mass index.', 'Effects of home-based diet and exercise on functional outcomes among older, overweight long-term cancer survivors: RENEW: a randomized controlled trial.', 'Reach out to ENhancE Wellness in Older Cancer Survivors (RENEW): design, methods and recruitment challenges of a home-based exercise and diet intervention to improve physical function among long-term survivors of breast, prostate, and colorectal cancer.', 'Interventions for promoting habitual exercise in people living with and beyond cancer.', 'Prostate cancer disparities in South Carolina: early detection, special programs, and descriptive epidemiology.', 'Rural-urban disparities in healthcare factors and long-term health outcomes in individuals with pediatric-onset spinal cord injury.', 'Physical activity and cognitive function: A comparison of rural and urban breast cancer survivors.', 'Results of DUET: A Web-Based Weight Loss Randomized Controlled Feasibility Trial among Cancer Survivors and Their Chosen Partners.', 'Rural-Urban Disparities in Cancer Outcomes: Opportunities for Future Research.', 'Effectiveness of Physical Activity Interventions among Rural Cancer Survivors: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.']"""

Significant advances in cancer treatment and imaging have been reported based on work with a water-soluble bis-sulfonated gallium corrole in both cellular and rodent-based models. We now show that cytotoxicities increase in the order Ga < Fe < Al < Mn < Sb < Au for bis-sulfonated corroles; and, importantly, that they correlate with metallocorrole affinities for very low density lipoprotein (VLDL), the main carrier of lipophilic drugs. As chemotherapeutic potential is predicted to be enhanced by increased lipophilicity, we have developed a novel method for the preparation of cell-penetrating lipophilic metallocorrole/serum-protein nanoparticles (NPs). Cryo-TEM revealed an average core metallocorrole particle size of 32 nm, with protein tendrils extending from the core (conjugate size is ~100 nm). Optical imaging of DU-145 prostate cancer cells treated with corrole NPs (≤100 nM) revealed fast cellular uptake, very slow release, and distribution into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and lysosomes. The physical properties of corrole NPs prepared in combination with transferrin and albumin were alike, but the former were internalized to a greater extent by the transferrin-receptor-rich DU-145 cells.

Results:   16.8% (n=1925) of articles published on US government-funded research were covered in the media. Published journal articles addressed all common cancers. Frequency of journal articles differed substantially across the common cancers, with breast cancer (n=1284), lung cancer (n=630) and prostate cancer (n=586) being the subject of the most journal articles.

For TURP, a single-dose antimicrobial prophylaxis (AP) is recommended to reduce postoperative urinary tract infections. So far, no international recommendations for AP have been established for GL. In a survey-based study in Switzerland, Germany and Austria, urologists reported routinely extending AP primarily for 3 days after both interventions. We therefore aim to determine whether single-dose AP with cotrimoxazole is non-inferior to 3-day AP with cotrimoxazole in patients undergoing TURP or GL of the prostate.  Methods/design:   We will conduct an investigator-initiated, multicentre, randomised controlled trial. We plan to assess the non-inferiority of single-dose AP compared to 3-day AP. The primary outcome is the occurrence of clinically diagnosed symptomatic urinary tract infections which are treated with antimicrobial agents within 30 days after randomisation. The vast majority of collected outcomes will be assessed from routinely collected data. The sample size was estimated to be able to show the non-inferiority of single-dose AP compared to 3-day AP with at least 80% power (1 - β = 0.8) at a significance level of α = 5%, applying a 1:1 randomisation scheme. The non-inferiority margin was determined in order to preserve 70% of the effect of usual care on the primary outcome. For an assumed event rate of 9% in both treatment arms, this resulted in a non-inferiority margin of 4.4% (i.e. 13.4% to 9%). To prove non-inferiority, a total of 1574 patients should be recruited, in order to have 1416 evaluable patients. The study is supported by the Swiss National Science Foundation.  Discussion:   For AP in TURP and GL, there is a large gap between usual clinical practice and evidence-based guidelines. If single-dose AP proves non-inferior to prolonged AP, our study findings may help to reduce the duration of AP in daily routine-potentially reducing the risk of emerging resistance and complications related to AP.

Methods:   A total of 419 treatment fractions were included in this analysis. The shifts required to align the patient for each treatment were performed using 3D matching between cone beam computed tomography scans and the corresponding computed tomography images used for planning. This was compared with the shifts obtained from 2D orthogonal kilovoltage images, matching with the corresponding digitally reconstructed radiographs. Patients did not have fiducials inserted to assist with localization. Interfractional changes in the bladder and rectal volumes were subsequently measured on the cone beam computed tomography images for each fraction and compared to the shift differences between orthogonal kilovoltage and cone beam computed tomography scans. The proportion of treatment fractions with a shift difference exceeding the planning target volume of 7 mm, between orthogonal kilovoltage and cone beam computed tomography scans, was calculated.  Results:   The mean vertical, lateral, and longitudinal shifts resulted from 2D match between orthogonal kilovoltage images and corresponding digitally reconstructed radiographs were 0.353 cm (interquartile range: 0.1-0.5), 0.346 cm (interquartile range: 0.1-0.5), and 0.289 cm (interquartile range: 0.1-0.4), compared to 0.388 cm (interquartile range: 0.1-0.5), 0.342 cm (interquartile range: 0.1-0.5), and 0.291 cm (interquartile range: 0.1-0.4) obtained from 3D match between cone beam computed tomography and planning computed tomography scan, respectively. Our results show a significant difference between the kilovoltage and cone beam computed tomography shifts in the anterior-posterior direction ( P = .01). The proportion of treatment fractions in which the differences in kilovoltage and cone beam computed tomography shifts between exceeded the 7 mm planning target volume margin was 6%, 2%, and 3% in the anterior-posterior, lateral, and superior-inferior directions, respectively.  Conclusion:   We prospectively demonstrated that the daily use of volumetric cone beam computed tomography for treatment localization in post-radical prostatectomy patients demonstrated an increased need for a shift in patient position.

Diphenyltin(IV) compounds exhibited greater potency than either the Schiff bases or the respective dimethyltin(IV) compounds. Mechanistic studies on the action of these compounds against bladder cancer cells revealed that they induced the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). The bladder cancer cells were apoptotic after 24 h post-treatment with the diphenyltin(IV) compounds. The interactions of the organotin(IV) compounds with calf thymus DNA (CT-DNA) were experimentally explored using UV-vis absorption spectroscopy.

However, the clinical application of siRNA-based therapeutics is significantly retarded by the paucity of successful delivery systems. Recently, multifunctional gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) as non-viral delivery carriers have shown promise for transporting chemotherapeutics, proteins/peptides, and genes. In this study, AuNPs capped with polyethylenimine (PEI) and PEGylated anisamide (a ligand known to target the sigma receptor) have been developed to produce a range of positively charged anisamide-targeted PEGylated AuNPs (namely Au-PEI-PEG-AA). The anisamide-targeted AuNPs effectively complexed siRNA via electrostatic interaction, and the resultant complex (Au110-PEI-PEG5000-AA.siRNA) illustrated favourable physicochemical characteristics, including particle size, surface charge, and stability. In vitro, anisamide-targeted AuNPs selectively bound to human prostate cancer PC-3 cells, inducing efficient endosomal escape of siRNA, and effective downregulation of the RelA gene. In vivo, prolonged systemic exposure of siRNA was achieved by anisamide-targeted AuNPs resulting in significant tumour growth suppression in a PC3 xenograft mouse model without an increase in toxicity. In addition, a combination of siRNA-mediated NF-κB knockdown using anisamide-targeted AuNPs with Paclitaxel produced a synergistic therapeutic response, thus providing a promising therapeutic strategy for the treatment of prostate cancer.""","""['Xue Luan', 'Kamil Rahme', 'Zhongcheng Cong', 'Limei Wang', 'Yifang Zou', 'Yan He', 'Hao Yang', 'Justin D Holmes', ""Caitriona M O'Driscoll"", 'Jianfeng Guo']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Eur J Pharm Biopharm""","""['Anisamide-targeted gold nanoparticles for siRNA delivery in prostate cancer - synthesis, physicochemical characterisation and in vitro evaluation.', 'Bioconjugated gold nanoparticles enhance cellular uptake: A proof of concept study for siRNA delivery in prostate cancer cells.', 'Development of anisamide-targeted PEGylated gold nanorods to deliver epirubicin for chemo-photothermal therapy in tumor-bearing mice.', 'Polymer decorated gold nanoparticles in nanomedicine conjugates.', 'Gold nanoparticle‑mediated delivery of paclitaxel and nucleic acids for cancer therapy (Review).', 'Gold Nanoparticles Conjugated with Dendrigraft Poly-L-lysine and Folate-Targeted Poly(ethylene glycol) for siRNA Delivery to Prostate cancer.', 'Functional ligands for improving anticancer drug therapy: current status and applications to drug delivery systems.', 'A targeted siRNA-loaded PDL1-exosome and functional evaluation against lung cancer.', 'A cyclodextrin-based nanoformulation achieves co-delivery of ginsenoside Rg3 and quercetin for chemo-immunotherapy in colorectal cancer.', 'A Review on Drug Delivery System for Tumor Therapy.']"""

A patient-specific 3D-printed mould was used to investigate the effects of fixation on VERDICT parameters and to aid registration to histology. A rich diffusion data set was acquired in each ex vivo prostate before and after fixation. At both time points, data were best described by a two-compartment model: the model assumes that an anisotropic tensor compartment represents the extracellular space and a restricted sphere compartment models the intracellular space. The effect of fixation on model parameters associated with tissue microstructure was small. The patient-specific mould minimized tissue deformations and co-localized slices, so that rigid registration of MRI to histology images allowed region-based comparison with histology. The VERDICT estimate of the intracellular volume fraction corresponded to histological indicators of cellular fraction, including high values in tumour regions. The average sphere radius from VERDICT, representing the average cell size, was relatively uniform across samples.

Material and method:   A number of 119 patients with clinical or biochemical suspicion for prostate cancer (PCa) were included. All patients harbored at least one PIRADS score ≥ 3 lesion and underwent MRI-TRUS fusion guided biopsy, as well as a concurrent systematic biopsy. The biopsy was performed by the same operator, using a rigidregistration software system.  Results:   The mean age of the patients was 62.2 years. The mean pre-biopsy PSA was 9.15 ng/dl. The diagnosis rate of MRI-TRUS fusion guided biopsy was 47% for overall PCa and 29.4% for clinically significant (cs) PCa. A higher PIRADS score was significantly associated with the presence of overall and csPCa. MRI-TRUS fusion guided biopsy had a higher percentage of positive biopsy cores (51% vs 29%), higher likelihood of csPCa (OR 5.36, p=0.008) and upgrading (14.8%) in comparison with systematic biopsy but missed 6.7% csPCa. The contralateral lobe systematic biopsy could have been avoided without losing the PCa diagnosis all patients with PIRADS score 5, both in initial and repeat biopsy setting. Anterior and transitional lesions were more likely to be diagnosed only by targeted cores.  Conclusion:   MRI-TRUS guided prostate biopsy improves the detection of PCa, but systematic biopsy is still essential. In selected cases (PIRADS 5), contralateral lobe systematic biopsy can safely be avoided.

Traditional radiology reports contain non-structured free text and potentially tangled information in narrative language, which can hamper the information transfer and diminish the clarity of the report. Therefore, this study investigates whether newly developed structured reports (SRs) of prostate magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can improve interdisciplinary communication, as compared to non-structured reports (NSRs).  Methods:   50 NSRs and 50 SRs describing a single prostatic lesion were presented to four urologists with expert level experience in prostate cancer surgery or targeted MRI TRUS fusion biopsy. They were subsequently asked to plot the tumor location in a 2-dimensional prostate diagram and to answer a questionnaire focusing on information on clinically relevant key features as well as the perceived structure of the report. A validated scoring system that distinguishes between ""major"" and ""minor"" mistakes was used to evaluate the accuracy of the plotting of the tumor position in the prostate diagram.  Results:   The mean total score for accuracy for SRs was significantly higher than for NSRs (28.46 [range 13.33-30.0] vs. 21.75 [range 0.0-30.0], p < 0.01). The overall rates of major mistakes (54% vs. 10%) and minor mistakes (74% vs. 22%) were significantly higher (p < 0.01) for NSRs than for SRs. The rate of radiologist re-consultations was significantly lower (p < 0.01) for SRs than for NSRs (19% vs. 85%). Furthermore, SRs were rated as significantly superior to NSRs in regard to determining the clinical tumor stage (p < 0.01), the quality of the summary (4.4 vs. 2.5; p < 0.01), and overall satisfaction with the report (4.5 vs. 2.3; p < 0.01), and as more valuable for further clinical decision-making and surgical planning (p < 0.01).  Conclusions:   Structured reporting of prostate MRI has the potential to improve interdisciplinary communication. Through SRs, expert urologists were able to more accurately assess the exact location of single prostate cancer lesions, which can facilitate surgical planning.

Results:   Our study identified 137 CRPC patients, with 126 (92%) patients receiving life-prolonging systemic treatment. The median age was 73 years. The initial management decision was DT in 71 (52%) patients and ET in 66 (48%) patients.

Luciferase assay and Western blot were utilized to explore the underlying mechanism of miR-492 in PCa cells.  Results:   MiR-492 expressed significantly higher in PCa tissues than that in the normal tissues. Its expression level was also over-expressed in PCa cells compared with that in the normal cells. The up-regulation of miR-492 promoted the growth, invasion, and migration of the cells, while down-regulation had the opposite effects. SOCS2 was identified as a potential target for miR-492 in PCa.

Presently, PSA testing is performed in centralized laboratories, which is associated with prolonged time between venipuncture and the PSA value being available. In this prospective study, we present a new and rapid test system for the quantitative determination of PSA levels from finger-stick blood.  Methods:   The Claros1® analyzer is a rapid microfluidics-based point-of-care system for quantitative PSA analysis from 10-µl finger-stick blood that requires only 10 min for testing. Total PSA concentrations by the Claros system in 100 consecutive asymptomatic men (median age 57 years, range 44-81 years) were compared with two commercially available, commonly used PSA assays (Abbott and Elecsys by Roche) performed by a reference laboratory.  Results:   Eighty-six percent of finger-stick blood-borne probes from 100 men were evaluable for PSA testing by the Claros1® analyzer system. In 13/14 cases the expiry date of the microfluid cassettes of the Claros system was exceeded and one blood puncture was performed inadequately. The correlations between the Claros results and OPKO-Abbott and OPKO-Roche assay results were high, with R2 values of 0.982 and 0.985, respectively. The R2 value for the Roche-Abbott correlation was 0.991 with a slope value of 1.160. Prostate cancer was diagnosed in seven cases, with a median PSA of 1.8 ng/ml in the Claros group compared to 1.75 ng/ml and 2.1 ng/ml in the Abbott and Roche groups, respectively.  Conclusion:   The Claros1® PSA assay combines the advantages of rapid, accurate detection with a low required sample volume, allowing the analysis to be performed using finger-stick blood. Provided that further analysis proves the reproducibility of the test, it may help to reduce the number of office visits, thus decreasing costs to the health care system.""","""['Agnieszka Maj-Hes', 'Sabina Sevcenco', 'Tibor Szarvas', 'Gero Kramer']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Adv Ther""","""['Measurement of circulating forms of prostate-specific antigen in whole blood immediately after venipuncture: implications for point-of-care testing.', 'Comparability of serum prostate-specific antigen measurement between the Roche Diagnostics Elecsys 2010 and the Abbott Architect i2000.', 'Prostate-specific antigen assay using whole blood samples spotted on filter paper and its application to mass screening for prostate cancer.', 'Assessment of a new point-of-care system for detection of prostate specific antigen.', 'Prostate cancer and microfluids.']"""

Methods:   We retrospectively reviewed our institutional database for PCa patients who had BCR and subsequently underwent 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT between April 2014 and February 2018. A total of 51 patients who were metastasis-free before PSMA imaging and previously treated with definitive therapy (radical prostatectomy or external beam radiotherapy) for localized disease (pT1c-T3b pN0-1 cM0) were included.  Results:   37 out of 51 patients (72.5%) had positive 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT scans. Age at diagnosis, Gleason score (GS), D'Amico risk status of PCa, initial PSA level before treatment and PSA doubling time were not associated with PSMA positivity. Pre-scan PSA levels of > 0.2 ng/ml and PSA velocity of ≥ 1 ng/ml/year were significantly associated with increased PSMA positivity, whereas history of androgen deprivation therapy showed a trend towards significance. The optimal cutoffs for distinguishing between positive and negative scans were ≥ 0.71 ng/ml for pre-scan PSA and ≥ 1.22 ng/ml/yr for PSA velocity. In multivariable analysis, log pre-scan PSA and pre-scan PSA level > 0.2 ng/ml remained significant predictors for PSMA positivity, whereas the association of PSA velocity and of ADT was lost.  Conclusions:   In BCR of localized PCa following definitive therapy, pre-scan PSA was strongly associated with positive 68Ga-PSMA-11 scan, even at PSA levels ranging from 0.2 to 1.0 ng/ml.

Objectives: In this meta-analysis, we aimed to evaluate the relationship between exposure to Cr(VI) and the mortality and incidence of human cancers. Methods: We performed a search of the literature and extracted the standardized mortality ratios (SMRs), standardized incidence ratios (SIRs), and their corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs), to estimate risk values. Subgroup analyses were conducted by sex, occupation, and types of cancer to identify groups that were at high-risk or predisposed to certain cancers. Results: A total of 47 cohort studies covering the period 1985-2016 were included (37 studies reporting SMRs and 16 studies reporting SIRs). The summary SMR for all studies combined was 1.07 (95% CI: 1.01-1.15). Summary SMRs were higher among chromate production workers, chrome platers, and masons, and especially male workers. In the subgroup analysis, Cr(VI) exposure was related to a higher risk of death owing to lung, larynx, bladder, kidney, testicular, bone, and thyroid cancer. The meta-SIR of all studies combined was 1.06 (95% CI: 1.04-1.09). Summary SIRs were elevated among cement industry workers and tanners. Cr(VI) exposure was related to an elevated risk of respiratory system, buccal cavity, pharynx, prostate, and stomach cancers. Conclusions: Cr(VI) might cause cancers of the respiratory system, buccal cavity and pharynx, prostate, and stomach in humans, and it is related to increased risk of overall mortality owing to lung, larynx, bladder, kidney, testicular, bone, and thyroid cancer.

The incidence of prostate disease is increasing, and some of this increase may be attributable to ancestral exposure to environmental toxicants and epigenetic transgenerational inheritance mechanisms. The goal of the current study was to determine the effects that exposure of gestating female rats to vinclozolin has on the epigenetic transgenerational inheritance of prostate disease, and to characterize by what molecular epigenetic mechanisms this has occurred. Gestating female rats (F0 generation) were exposed to vinclozolin during E8-E14 of gestation. F1 generation offspring were bred to produce the F2 generation, which were bred to produce the transgenerational F3 generation. The transgenerational F3 generation vinclozolin lineage males at 12 months of age had an increased incidence of prostate histopathology and abnormalities compared to the control lineage. Ventral prostate epithelial and stromal cells were isolated from F3 generation 20-day old rats, prior to the onset of pathology, and used to obtain DNA and RNA for analysis. Results indicate that there were transgenerational changes in gene expression, noncoding RNA expression, and DNA methylation in both cell types. Our results suggest that ancestral exposure to vinclozolin at a critical period of gestation induces the epigenetic transgenerational inheritance of prostate stromal and epithelial cell changes in both the epigenome and transcriptome that ultimately lead to prostate disease susceptibility and may serve as a source of the increased incidence of prostate pathology observed in recent years.""","""['Rachel Klukovich', 'Eric Nilsson', 'Ingrid Sadler-Riggleman', 'Daniel Beck', 'Yeming Xie', 'Wei Yan', 'Michael K Skinner']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Sci Rep""","""['Epigenetic transgenerational inheritance of testis pathology and Sertoli cell epimutations: generational origins of male infertility.', 'Environmental toxicant induced epigenetic transgenerational inheritance of ovarian pathology and granulosa cell epigenome and transcriptome alterations: ancestral origins of polycystic ovarian syndrome and primary ovarian insufiency.', 'Vinclozolin induced epigenetic transgenerational inheritance of pathologies and sperm epimutation biomarkers for specific diseases.', 'What is an epigenetic transgenerational phenotype?

Methods: We studied return to work in a population-based sample of 1558 long-term cancer survivors, diagnosed in 1994-2004 with breast, colorectal or prostate cancer before age 60 (mean 50.1). Information regarding employment status and financial difficulties was obtained via mailed questionnaires from patients who were identified by six population-based cancer registries in Germany. Cumulative incidence of return to work was determined by time-to-event analysis with consideration of competing events. Chi2 tests and multiple logistic regression modeling were employed to identify potential sociodemographic and clinical determinants of return to work. Results: Within a mean period since diagnosis of 8.3 years, 63% of all working-age cancer survivors initially returned to their old job and another 7% took up a new job. Seventeen percent were granted a disability pension, 6% were early retired (not cancer-related), 4% became unemployed, and 1% left the job market for other reasons. Resumption of work occurred within the first 2 years after diagnosis in 90% of all returnees. Cancer-related reduction of working hours was reported by 17% among all returnees and 6% quit their job due to cancer within 5 years past return to work. The probability of return to work was strongly related with age at diagnosis, tumor stage, education, and occupational class but did not differ with respect to the tumor site, gender nor marital status.

Patients and methods: Patients with prostate cancer awaiting initiation of A.D.T. were consecutively included from the daily clinic. They were followed every 6 months for 2 years. The study consisted of questionnaires, blood and urine samples and a D.X.A. scan every 6 months and yearly bone scintigraphy.

Patients are ""reclassified"" with higher-risk disease if they show signs of disease progression. However, AS patients who will reclassify cannot be easily identified upfront and suffer morbidities associated with biopsy. Biomarkers derived from noninvasively obtained specimens such as serum or urine samples are promising alternatives to monitor patients with clinically insignificant cancer. Previously, we have characterized and validated a urinary DNA methylation panel and a serum miRNA panel for the prediction of patient reclassification in 2 independent AS cohorts. In this exploratory study, we have investigated cell-free miRNAs in the urinary supernatant combined with urinary DNA methylation markers to form an integrative panel for prediction of AS patient reclassification.  Methods:   Post-DRE urine was collected from 103 CaP patients on active surveillance. Urinary sediment DNA methylation levels of selected genes were previously analyzed using qPCR-based MethyLight assay. Using qRT-PCR, we analyzed the urinary supernatants for relative quantities of 10 miRNAs previously shown to be associated with AS reclassification. Logistic regression and Receiver Operating Characteristics curve analyses were performed to assess the predictive ability of miRNAs and DNA methylation biomarkers.  Results:   We identified a 3-marker panel, consisting of miR-24, miR-30c and CRIP3 methylation, that was significant for prediction of patient reclassification (Odds ratio = 2.166, 95% confidence interval = 1.22-3.847) with a negative predictive value of 90.9%. Our 3-marker panel also demonstrated additive value to PSA for prediction of patient reclassification (c-statistic = 0.717, ROC bootstrapped 1000 iteration P = 0.041).  Conclusion:   A urinary integrated panel of methylation and miRNA markers is a promising approach to identify AS patients at risk for reclassification. Our 3-marker panel, with its high negative predictive value, would be beneficial to identify and preclude AS patients with truly indolent cancer and to personalize monitoring strategies for AS patients.""","""['Fang Zhao', 'Danny Vesprini', 'Richard S C Liu', 'Ekaterina Olkhov-Mitsel', 'Laurence H Klotz', 'Andrew Loblaw', 'Stanley K Liu', 'Bharati Bapat']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Urol Oncol""","""['Urinary DNA Methylation Biomarkers for Noninvasive Prediction of Aggressive Disease in Patients with Prostate Cancer on Active Surveillance.', 'Assessment of Serum microRNA Biomarkers to Predict Reclassification of Prostate Cancer in Patients on Active Surveillance.', 'A urine-based DNA methylation assay, ProCUrE, to identify clinically significant prostate cancer.', 'Novel tools to improve patient selection and monitoring on active surveillance for low-risk prostate cancer: a systematic review.', 'Urinary biomarkers in prostate cancer detection and monitoring progression.', 'Recent Advances in Blood-Based Liquid Biopsy Approaches in Prostate Cancer.', 'Crosstalk between miRNAs and DNA Methylation in Cancer.', 'New Perspectives on the Importance of Cell-Free DNA Biology.', 'Serine and one-carbon metabolisms bring new therapeutic venues in prostate cancer.', 'Investigating Urinary Circular RNA Biomarkers for Improved Detection of Renal Cell Carcinoma.']"""

Objective:   To quantify the frequency of germline DNA repair gene mutations in UK PCa cases and controls, in order to more comprehensively evaluate the contribution of individual genes to overall PCa risk and likelihood of aggressive disease.  Design, setting, and participants:   We sequenced 167 DNA repair and eight PCa candidate genes in a UK-based cohort of 1281 young-onset PCa cases (diagnosed at ≤60yr) and 1160 selected controls.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Gene-level SKAT-O and gene-set adaptive combination of p values (ADA) analyses were performed separately for cases versus controls, and aggressive (Gleason score ≥8, n=201) versus nonaggressive (Gleason score ≤7, n=1048) cases.  Results and limitations:   We identified 233 unique protein truncating variants (PTVs) with minor allele frequency <0.5% in controls in 97 genes. The total proportion of PTV carriers was higher in cases than in controls (15% vs 12%, odds ratio [OR]=1.29, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.01-1.64, p=0.036). Gene-level analyses selected NBN (pSKAT-O=2.4×10-4) for overall risk and XPC (pSKAT-O=1.6×10-4) for aggressive disease, both at candidate-level significance (p<3.1×10-4 and p<3.4×10-4, respectively). Gene-set analysis identified a subset of 20 genes associated with increased PCa risk (OR=3.2, 95% CI 2.1-4.8, pADA=4.1×10-3) and four genes that increased risk of aggressive disease (OR=11.2, 95% CI 4.6-27.7, pADA=5.6×10-3), three of which overlap the predisposition gene set.  Conclusions:   The union of the gene-level and gene-set-level analyses identified 23 unique DNA repair genes associated with PCa predisposition or risk of aggressive disease. These findings will help facilitate the development of a PCa-specific sequencing panel with both predictive and prognostic potential.

Methods and materials:   Thirty-one patients received 45 Gray (Gy) of external beam radiation therapy to the prostate and seminal vesicles, together with a brachytherapy boost via a transperineal prostate implant of I125 (108 Gy). In addition, some patients received 6 months of androgen deprivation therapy depending on physician preference. Biochemical failure was defined using the Phoenix consensus definition of the nadir PSA +2 ng/mL. Toxicity was graded using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.0.  Results:   The biochemical progression-free survival, metastases-free survival, and overall survival at 5 years were 87.1%, 96.3%, and 92%, respectively. The incidence of late grade ≥1 and ≥2 genitourinary (GU) toxicities were 54.8% and 6.5%, respectively. The incidence of late grade 3 GU toxicity was 6.5% with urinary retention occurring in two patients requiring either a bladder neck incision or transurethral resection of the prostate. The incidence of late grade ≥1 and 2 gastrointestinal toxicities were 19.4% and 6.5%, respectively. No patients developed grade 3 gastrointestinal toxicity.  Conclusion:   Our small series has shown a high biochemical progression-free survival consistent with the ASCENDE-RT and NRG Oncology/RTOG0232 LDR-PB boost arms. In addition, the risk of late grade 3 GU toxicity is far lower than that reported by the ASCENDE-RT study but comparable to other LDR-PB boost and LDR alone reports in the literature.

Methods:   105 patients with prostate cancer who underwent Mp-MRI of prostate prior to radical prostatectomy were enrolled in this retrospective study. LCC was determined from T2-weighted images (T2WI), Apparent Diffusion Coefficient (ADC) map, dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) separately by two blinded radiologists. The LCCs in patients with and without EPE were compared with Mann Whitney-U test. The relationship between pathological LCC and the LCC that was measured from each Mp-MRI sequences were calculated by using Spearman test. The ability of all individual Mp-MRI sequences in determining pathological LCC was calculated by drawing receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curves. The diagnostic accuracy of LCC based on each MRI sequences for EPE diagnosis was also calculated with ROC curve analysis.  Results:   The patients with EPE had longer median LCC than patients without EPE for each Mp-MRI sequences and for both readers. In addition, the LCC showed a broader overlapping between patients with and without EPE on ADC map (reader-1, p = 0.01; reader-2, p = 0.01) when compared with T2WI (reader-1, p = 0.002; reader-2, p = 0.001) and DCE-MRI (reader-1, p = 0.001; reader-2, p = 0.001). LCC based on DCE-MRI showed the strongest correlation with pathological LCC. The area under the curve (AUC) based on LCC was higher when using the DCE-MRI (reader-1: 0.874, p = 0.030; reader-2: 0.862, p = 0.02) than when using T2WI and ADC map in predicting pathological LCC for both readers. While the LCC based on ADC map showed poor diagnostic accuracy, LCC based on T2WI and DCE-MRI had fair diagnostic accuracy for EPE diagnosis.  Conclusion:   The contact between prostate tumor and capsule seems to be a useful and objective parameter for evaluating the EPE of prostate cancer with Mp-MRI. More specifically, LCC based on DCE-MRI has highest correlation with pathological LCC and has better ability to predict pathological LCC when compared with other Mp-MRI sequences. However, the performance of LCC based on T2WI and DCE-MRI was similar for EPE diagnosis. It seems measurement of LCC from DCE-MRI and measurement of LCC from T2WI does not show any difference in clinical EPE assessment.""","""['Aslıhan Onay', 'Metin Vural', 'Ayse Armutlu', 'Sevda Ozel Yıldız', 'Murat Can Kiremit', 'Tarık Esen', 'Barıs Bakır']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Eur J Radiol""","""['Extraprostatic extension in prostate cancer: primer for radiologists.', 'Evaluation of MRI for diagnosis of extraprostatic extension in prostate cancer.', 'Length of capsular contact on prostate MRI as a predictor of extracapsular extension: which is the most optimal sequence?', 'Length of capsular contact for diagnosing extraprostatic extension on prostate MRI: Assessment at an optimal threshold.', 'Multiparametric MRI in detection and staging of prostate cancer.', 'The Quantitative Assessment of Using Multiparametric MRI for Prediction of Extraprostatic Extension in Patients Undergoing Radical Prostatectomy: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.', 'The absolute tumor-capsule contact length in the diagnosis of extraprostatic extension of prostate cancer.', 'The Diagnostic Performance of the Length of Tumor Capsular Contact on MRI for Detecting Prostate Cancer Extraprostatic Extension: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.', 'Extraprostatic extension in prostate cancer: primer for radiologists.']"""

Since most precancerous and cancerous tissues show signs of inflammation, chronic bacterial prostatitis has been hypothesized to be a possible etiology. However, establishing a causal relationship between microbial inflammation and PCa requires a comprehensive analysis of the prostate microbiome. The aim of this study was to characterize the microbiome in prostate tissue of PCa patients and investigate its association with tumour clinical characteristics as well as host expression profiles.  Results:   The metagenome and metatranscriptome of tumour and the adjacent benign tissues were assessed in 65 Chinese radical prostatectomy specimens. Escherichia, Propionibacterium, Acinetobacter and Pseudomonas were abundant in both metagenome and metatranscriptome, thus constituting the core of the prostate microbiome. The biodiversity of the microbiomes could not be differentiated between the matched tumour/benign specimens or between the tumour specimens of low and high Gleason Scores. The expression profile of ten Pseudomonas genes was strongly correlated with that of eight host small RNA genes; three of the RNA genes may negatively associate with metastasis. Few viruses could be identified from the prostate microbiomes.  Conclusions:   This is the first study of the human prostate microbiome employing an integrated metagenomics and metatranscriptomics approach. In this Chinese cohort, both metagenome and metatranscriptome analyses showed a non-sterile microenvironment in the prostate of PCa patients, but we did not find links between the microbiome and local progression of PCa. However, the correlated expression of Pseudomonas genes and human small RNA genes may provide tantalizing preliminary evidence that Pseudomonas infection may impede metastasis.""","""['Ye Feng', 'Varune Rohan Ramnarine', 'Robert Bell', 'Stanislav Volik', 'Elai Davicioni', 'Vanessa M Hayes', 'Shancheng Ren', 'Colin C Collins']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""BMC Genomics""","""['Metagenomic analysis reveals a rich bacterial content in high-risk prostate tumors from African men.', 'Microbiota of the prostate tumor environment investigated by whole-transcriptome profiling.', 'Bioinformatics tools for quantitative and functional metagenome and metatranscriptome data analysis in microbes.', 'Integrated metagenomic data analysis demonstrates that a loss of diversity in oral microbiota is associated with periodontitis.', 'High throughput sequencing methods and analysis for microbiome research.', 'Is type III prostatitis also associated with bacterial infection?', 'Bacteria in cancer initiation, promotion and progression.', 'Insights into the Human Microbiome and Its Connections with Prostate Cancer.', 'The human microbiome links to prostate cancer risk and treatment (Review).', 'Investigating the oral microbiome in retrospective and prospective cases of prostate, colon, and breast cancer.']"""

Alteration of both smooth and striate urethral sphincter occurs after RARP. Since the contraction of perineal muscles is involved in the complex mechanism of urinary continence, the uroflow stop test (UST) seems to predict early continence recovery after RARP. The UST was added of perineal surface electromyography (EMG) evaluation to evaluate the latency time (LT) between muscular contraction and the complete stop of urine flow. Our aim was to present UST-EMG as a new tool in the investigation of UI, implying pelvic floor integrity, and to evaluate whether an early return (≤ 3 months) to preoperative LT could be associated with early recovery of UC (≤ 3 months).  Methods:   After prospectively enrolling 137 patients who underwent RARP with a minimum follow-up of 6 months, we identified two groups: Group 1 (93 patients) with early (≤ 3 months) pre-surgical LT recovery and Group 2 (44 patients) with late > 3 months or not able to reach pre-surgical LT recovery.  Results:   Between the two groups, there were significant differences in terms of different surgical technique (nerve-sparing versus non-nerve-sparing) and pads use at 3 and 6 months after RARP (p < 0.05). No differences were recorded neither in postoperative maximum flow-rate, nor in postoperative symptoms score.

Although serum is well known to affect various biological activities in cancer cells, its effect in vasculogenic mimicry (VM) is not yet fully defined. Thus, this study investigated the role of serum in VM in human prostate cancer (PCa) PC-3 cells.  Main methods:   Invasion assay and 3D culture VM tube formation assay are performed. VM-related molecules are checked by western blot and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. Nuclear twist is detected by confocal after twist-FITC/DAPI double staining.  Key findings:   Serum dramatically induced not only invasion but also VM. Serum increased the phosphorylation of erythropoietin-producing hepatocellular A2 (EphA2) without affecting EphA2 expression. Both the protein and mRNA expression levels of vascular endothelial cadherin (VE-cadherin) are up-regulated by serum. Twist expression was increased in the nucleus by serum. Serum activated AKT through phosphorylation, despite the unchanged AKT expression. Serum caused an increase in matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) and laminin subunit 5 gamma-2 (LAMC2) protein expressions. Wortmannin, a phosphoinositide-3-kinase inhibitor, significantly decreased serum-induced invasion and VM.  Significance:   These results demonstrated that serum activates EphA2 and up-regulates twist/VE-cadherin, which in turn activate AKT that up-regulates MMP-2 and LAMC2, thereby inducing the invasion and VM of human PCa PC-3 cells.""","""['Changhwan Yeo', 'Hyo-Jeong Lee', 'Eun-Ok Lee']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Life Sci""","""['Resveratrol suppresses serum-induced vasculogenic mimicry through impairing the EphA2/twist-VE-cadherin/AKT pathway in human prostate cancer PC-3 cells.', 'Sp1 Plays a Key Role in Vasculogenic Mimicry of Human Prostate Cancer Cells.', 'Epigallocatechin-3-Gallate Suppresses Vasculogenic Mimicry through Inhibiting the Twist/VE-Cadherin/AKT Pathway in Human Prostate Cancer PC-3 Cells.', 'Vasculogenic mimicry--potential target for tumor therapy.', 'Vasculogenic mimicry: current status and future prospects.', 'LncRNAs associated with vascular mimicry establish a novel molecular subtype and prognostic model for pancreatic cancer.', 'Resveratrol suppresses serum-induced vasculogenic mimicry through impairing the EphA2/twist-VE-cadherin/AKT pathway in human prostate cancer PC-3 cells.', 'The Biomarker Like the Correlation between Vasculogenic Mimicry, Vascular Endothelial Cadherin, Sex-DeterminingRegion on Y-Box Transcription Factor 17, and Cyclin D1 in Oesophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma.', 'Sp1 Plays a Key Role in Vasculogenic Mimicry of Human Prostate Cancer Cells.', 'ErbB4-mediated regulation of vasculogenic mimicry capability in breast cancer cells.']"""

Therefore, we aim to measure and compare the cancer detection rates between individual radiologists and urologists at a single academic institution.  Methods:   A consecutive sample of patients undergoing magnetic resonance imaging-guided biopsy at a single institution were included for analysis. The detection of any and clinically significant (Gleason score ≥3+4) prostate cancer was compared between radiologists and urologists after adjusting for relevant demographic and clinical characteristics. Analysis was conducted on a perlesion basis and only the results of the targeted cores were considered in the primary analysis.  Results:   Two hundred eighty-one patients with 418 lesions were included in the study. Prostate cancer of any grade was detected in 43.7% (183/418) of targeted lesions. There was no difference in the distribution of Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PIRADS) scores attributed by each radiologist (p = 0.43). The individual radiologist cancer detection rate for both overall and clinically significant cancer was similar across each PIRADS score except for the detection of any cancer in PIRADS 3 lesions (p = 0.03).

Despite careful surgical planning, many NVB preservation techniques are changed intraoperatively from their preoperative plan. Our objective was to identify risk factors predicting intraoperative change in NVB preservation technique during RARP.  Materials and methods:   Prospective data from 578 RARPs performed by a single surgeon between 2010 and 2017 at a tertiary care center. Side-specific NVB preservation technique was planned preoperatively. Surgical techniques were either complete nerve sparing (CNS), or incomplete nerve sparing (INS). Variables included age, tumor grade, prostate volume, number of lifetime biopsies, history of post-biopsy sepsis, and laterality. Variables were modeled in multivariable logistic regressions as potential predictors of deviation in surgical technique. Functional and oncological outcomes were also assessed.  Results:   A total of 46.9% of cases underwent some intraoperative change in NVB preservation from their preoperative plan. A total of 37.7% of 880 prostate sides planned for CNS underwent unplanned INS. Older age, Gleason ≥ 3+4, post-biopsy sepsis, prostate volume, and left-sided dissections were significantly associated with unplanned INS. Number of lifetime biopsies was not a predictor of unplanned INS. Patients with an intraoperative change to INS had poorer potency and continence. Study limitations included the retrospective nature of analysis and lack of pathological assessment of NVB preservation.  Conclusions:   Age, Gleason ≥ 3+4, post-biopsy sepsis, prostate volume, and laterality were significant predictors of unplanned INS during RARP, which should guide patient counseling when discussing risks and functional outcomes. The number of lifetime biopsies did not predict unplanned INS, a valuable finding for patients on active surveillance.

Materials and methods:   We reviewed a single-surgeon experience of 429 systematic transrectal prostate biopsies from 2010-2014. Marking ink was applied to the capsular edge ex vivo following specimen acquisition, and the proximity of cancer to the stained capsular edge was measured. Primary outcome was ECE at RP. Demographics, PSA, DRE findings, Gleason score, core location and involvement, and RP pathology were recorded. Predictors of ECE were identified using multivariable logistic regression. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses were performed to assess the predictive value of variables alone and in combination.  Results:   One hundred and one patients who underwent staining during biopsy received RP (202 hemiprostates). Thirty-three patients (40 hemiprostates) exhibited ECE. There were 343 positive stained biopsy cores. Mean proximity of carcinoma to capsule was 4.7 mm. On univariable analysis, proximity of positive core ≤ 1 mm to capsule was predictive of side-specific ECE (OR 2.86, p = 0.013), though significance was lost in multivariable models. Area under the curve (AUC) for proximity was 0.571 alone and 0.804 in combination with PSA, cT stage, and total biopsy Gleason score.  Conclusion:   Proximity of positive biopsy core to capsular margin may supply additional information in predicting ECE but requires validation in a larger cohort.

Current evidence on comparison between robotic (RARP) and open retropubic prostatectomy (RRP) in terms of the development of symptomatic LCs (SLCs) is conflicting. Moreover, no single-center assessment has illuminated the impact of the anterior vs. posterior approach of RARP on the rate of SLCs yet. We aimed to compare RRP and transperitoneal RARP for the SLC development and associated clinical risk factors.  Methods:   Patients treated with RRP or transperitoneal RARP (both with standard PLND) were included. Univariate comparisons and multivariate logistic regression analysis were utilized to compare the cohorts and define independent predictive variables for the development of SLCs.  Results:   Five hundred and ninety-five consecutive PCa patients underwent RRP and 277 ones RARP (76 anterior and 201 posterior approaches). The incidence of SLCs did not differ between both cohorts. Age and lymph node yield were independent predictors for the development of SLCs after RRP. There was a trend for a longer median time to development of SLCs after RARP as compared to RRP. Median duration of percutaneous drainage tended to be higher after RRP then after RARP. Failure rate of lymphocele drainage was comparable between both techniques.  Conclusions:   RRP and RARP are associated with the same risk for the development of a SLC. Posterior approach does not reduce the SLC formation compared to the anterior technique.

In this study, we developed an Al18F-labeled radiotracer and evaluated its potential for prostate cancer imaging. Methods: Al18F-PSMA-BCH (BCH is Beijing Cancer Hospital) was efficiently prepared manually. The binding affinity to PSMA was evaluated in vitro using the 22Rv1 (PSMA-positive) cell line. Small-animal PET imaging, biodistribution studies of Al18F-PSMA-BCH in mice bearing 22Rv1 and PC-3 (PSMA-negative) xenografted tumors, and a comparison with 68Ga-PSMA-617 in mice bearing LNCaP tumors were performed. PET/CT imaging was performed on 11 newly diagnosed prostate cancer patients at 1 and 2 h after injection. Biodistribution and preliminary efficacy were evaluated, and radiation dosimetry was estimated using OLINDA/EXM 2.0 software. Results: Al18F-PSMA-BCH was prepared within 30 min and was found to bind to PSMA with a dissociation constant of 2.90 ± 0.83 nM. Small-animal PET imaging of Al18F-PSMA-BCH could clearly differentiate 22Rv1 tumors from PC-3 tumors, as confirmed by ex vivo biodistribution data (7.87% ± 2.37% and 0.54% ± 0.22% injected dose/g at 1 h in 22Rv1 and PC-3 tumors, respectively). The uptake of Al18F-PSMA-BCH in 22Rv1 tumors could be substantially blocked by excess ZJ-43, a PSMA inhibitor. High-level accumulation of Al18F-PSMA-BCH was observed in PSMA-expressing organs, with increased uptake at later time points. Thirty-seven tumor lesions were detected in 11 patients, and the SUVmax in 27 lesions increased between 1 and 2 h after injection (10.60 vs. 14.11). The SUVmax in primary lesions in patients with high-risk prostate cancer was higher than that in patients with intermediate-risk prostate cancer. The kidneys received the highest estimated dose, 0.135 mGy/MBq, and the effective dose was 0.016 mGy/MBq. Conclusion: Al18F-PSMA-BCH was conveniently prepared with a reasonable yield within 30 min and showed a promising imaging capability for prostate cancer with reasonable radiation exposure.

In this study, we asked whether activation of AP-1 modifies androgen-responsive gene transcription, and whether androgens effect AP-1-regulated gene transcription. We show that activation of AP-1 via expression of a constitutively active mutant of mitogen-activated/extracellular signal responsive kinase kinase (MEK) kinase-1 did not increase the activity of the androgen-responsive probasin promoter. Likewise, expression of a constitutively active mutant of the transcription factor c-Jun, which is a major constitutent of AP-1, did not increase the activity of the probasin promoter. In contrast, 5α-dihydrotestosterone (DHT) activated both the probasin promoter and the AP-1-regulated collagenase promoter in LNCaP prostate cancer cells. The AP-1 binding site within the collagenase promoter was identified as DHT-responsive element. In line with this, DHT increased the activities of the c-Jun promoter and the tumor necrosis factor alpha promoter, which both contain AP-1 binding sites. The signal transduction pathway coupling DHT stimulation with AP-1 activation required c-Jun, MAP kinases and androgen receptors, but was independent of transient receptor potential melastatin-8 (TRPM8) channels, proposed to function as ionotropic testosterone receptors.

Upfront abiraterone combined with ADT has proved survival benefit. However, its effect on oncological outcome among different ethnicities and in abiraterone treatment remain unclear.  Objective:   To investigate the significance of missense polymorphism in HSD3B1 gene among men treated with primary ADT or abiraterone.  Design, setting, and participants:   This prognostic study included Japanese patients with metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer between June 1993 and July 2005 and with castration-resistant prostate cancer between September 2014 and February 2018. Genome DNA was obtained from patient whole blood samples, and genotyping on HSD3B1 (rs1047303, 1245C) was performed by Sanger sequencing.  Exposures:   Primary ADT for metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer and abiraterone for castration-resistant prostate cancer.  Main outcomes and measures:   The association of genotype in HSD3B1 with clinicopathological parameters and oncological outcome, including prostate-specific antigen response, progression-free survival, treatment failure-free survival, and overall survival was examined.  Results:   Of 203 men, 104 were in the primary ADT cohort (median [interquartile range] age, 72 [67-76] years) and 99 men were in the abiraterone group (median [interquartile range] age, 74 [67-80] years). Most patients carried metastatic lesions in each cohort. Among the cohort of primary ADT, men carrying heterozygous and homozygous variant types in HSD3B1 gene showed higher progression risk (hazard ratio [HR], 2.34; 95% CI, 1.08-4.49; P = .03) but not any-caused death risk (HR, 1.36; 95% CI, 0.52-2.92; P = .50), compared with men carrying homozygous wild type. In contrast, among the abiraterone cohort, men carrying variant type in HSD3B1 gene showed lower progression risk (HR, 0.32; 95% CI, 0.12-0.69; P = .006) and lower all-cause mortality risk (HR, 0.40; 95% CI, 0.13-0.94; P = .04) compared with men carrying homozygous wild type.

Thus, microbiome signature analysis potentially provides clinical diagnosis and outcome predictions. The array data were validated by PCR and targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS). Specific NGS data suggested that certain viral genomic sequences were inserted into the host somatic chromosomes of the prostate cancer samples.

In this study, we used a previously developed microfluidic system to confine single PC-3 cells in microwells using dielectrophoretic forces and perform the impedance measurements. PC-3 cells are treated with 100 μM Enzalutamide drug, and their impedance response is recorded until the cells are totally dead as predicted with viability tests. Four different approaches are used to analyze the impedance spectrum. Equivalent circuit modeling is used to extract the cell electrical properties as a function of time. Principal component analysis (PCA) is used to quantify cellular response to drug as a function of time. Single frequency measurements are conducted to observe how the cells respond over time. Finally, opacity ratio is defined as an additional quantification method. This device is capable of quantitatively measuring drug effects on biological cells and detecting cell death.

In survival analysis, it is often necessary to discriminate between influential and noninfluential markers. It is common to perform univariate screening using Cox scores, which quantify the associations between survival and each of the markers to provide a ranking. Since Cox scores do not account for dependencies between the markers, their use is suboptimal in the presence of highly correlated markers.  Methods:   As an alternative to the Cox score, we propose the correlation-adjusted regression survival (CARS) score for right-censored survival outcomes. By removing the correlations between the markers, the CARS score quantifies the associations between the outcome and the set of ""decorrelated"" marker values. Estimation of the scores is based on inverse probability weighting, which is applied to log-transformed event times. For high-dimensional data, estimation is based on shrinkage techniques.  Results:   The consistency of the CARS score is proven under mild regularity conditions. In simulations with high correlations, survival models based on CARS score rankings achieved higher areas under the precision-recall curve than competing methods. Two example applications on prostate and breast cancer confirmed these results. CARS scores are implemented in the R package carSurv.  Conclusions:   In research applications involving high-dimensional genetic data, the use of CARS scores for marker selection is a favorable alternative to Cox scores even when correlations between covariates are low. Having a straightforward interpretation and low computational requirements, CARS scores are an easy-to-use screening tool in personalized medicine research.""","""['Thomas Welchowski', 'Verena Zuber', 'Matthias Schmid']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Stat Med""","""['Robust estimation of the expected survival probabilities from high-dimensional Cox models with biomarker-by-treatment interactions in randomized clinical trials.', 'Prediction of Overall Survival Among Female Patients With Breast Cancer Using a Prognostic Signature Based on 8 DNA Repair-Related Genes.', 'Predicting censored survival data based on the interactions between meta-dimensional omics data in breast cancer.', 'The value of multigene predictors of clinical outcome in breast cancer: an analysis of the evidence.', 'Comparison of stopped Cox regression with direct methods such as pseudo-values and binomial regression.', 'Dynamic prediction with time-dependent marker in survival analysis using supervised functional principal component analysis.', 'Elastic Correlation Adjusted Regression (ECAR) scores for high dimensional variable importance measuring.', 'Benchmark of filter methods for feature selection in high-dimensional gene expression survival data.', 'Predicting the onset of breast cancer using mammogram imaging data with irregular boundary.']"""

Additionally, nonnuclear or nongenomic activities of the AR have long been described, but understanding of these activities remains elusive. Here, we report that AR is imported into and localizes to mitochondria and has a novel role in regulating multiple mitochondrial processes. Employing complementary experimental approaches of AR knockdown in AR-expressing cells and ectopic AR expression in AR-deficient cells, we demonstrate an inverse relationship between AR expression and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) content and transcription factor A, mitochondrial (TFAM), a regulator of mtDNA content. We show that AR localizes to mitochondria in prostate tissues and cell lines and is imported into mitochondria in vitro We also found that AR contains a 36-amino-acid-long mitochondrial localization sequence (MLS) capable of targeting a passenger protein (GFP) to the mitochondria and that deletion of the MLS abolishes the import of AR into the mitochondria. Ectopic AR expression reduced the expression of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) subunits. Interestingly, AR also controlled translation of mtDNA-encoded genes by regulating expression of multiple nuclear DNA-encoded mitochondrial ribosomal proteins. Consistent with these observations, OXPHOS supercomplexes were destabilized, and OXPHOS enzymatic activities were reduced in AR-expressing cells and restored upon AR knockdown. Moreover, mitochondrial impairment induced AR expression and increased its translocation into mitochondria. We conclude that AR localizes to mitochondria, where it controls multiple mitochondrial functions and mitonuclear communication.

As there is an urgent need for effective CRPC drugs, targeting hnRNP A1 could, therefore, serve a dual purpose of preventing AR-V7 generation as well as reducing c-Myc transcriptional output.

Materials and methods:   We examined our database of consecutive men who received prostate mpMRI prior to biopsy between September 2014 and December 2016 (n = 459). Test performance (eg, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value [PPV] and negative predictive value) were defined with PI-RADS classification 4 or 5 considered test positive and Gleason score ≥7 on biopsy from any targeted core considered outcome positive. Multivariate logistic regression was performed to identify clinical variables that affect test performance.  Results:   No significant differences in test performance were found among individual radiologists. Prior biopsy (odds ratio [OR] 0.10, P = .01), radiologist experience >500 prostate mpMRI (OR 0.18, P = .04), transition zone location (OR 0.10, P = .04), and posterior location (OR 0.04, P = .03) were predictors of diminished sensitivity.

Here we set out to develop a new pathway ""PEOPLE: PatiEnt prOstate samPLes for rEsearch"" to collect high-quality fresh tissue for research use, using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to target areas of tumor and benign tissue.  Methods:   Prostate tissue was sampled following robotic radical prostatectomy, using MRI data to target areas of benign and tumor tissue. Initially, 25 cases were sampled using MRI information from clinical notes. A further 59 cases were sampled using an optimized method that included specific MRI measurements of tumor location along with additional exclusion criteria. All cases were reviewed in batches with detailed clinical and histopathological data recorded. For one subset of samples, DNA was extracted and underwent quality control. Ex vivo culture was carried out using the gelatin sponge method for an additional subset.  Results:   Tumor was successfully fully or partially targeted in 64% of the initial cohort and 70% of the optimized cohort. DNA of high quality and concentration was isolated from 39 tumor samples, and ex vivo culture was successfully carried out in three cases with tissue morphology, proliferation, and apoptosis remaining comparable before and after 72 hours culture.

This multicenter study aimed to prospectively asses its role as a taxane-resistance biomarker in blood and retrospectively in tumors, exploring also the impact of prior abiraterone/enzalutamide (A/E) in patients and in vitro. TMPRSS2-ERG was tested by quantitative reverse-transcription PCR. We included 204 patients (137 blood and 124 tumor samples) treated with taxanes. TMPRSS2-ERG expression was correlated with prostate-specific antigen (PSA)-progression-free survival (PFS), radiological-PFS (RX-PFS), and overall survival (OS). Independent association with survival was evaluated by multivariate Cox modeling. In vitro ERG knockdown and combinatorial and sequential experiments with enzalutamide and docetaxel were performed in VCaP cells. Prior A/E (HR 1.8, 95% CI 1.2-2.8) and blood TMPRSS2-ERG detection (HR 2, 95% CI 1.1-3.7) were independently associated to lower PSA-PFS. In patients without prior A/E, blood and tumor TMPRSS2-ERG independently predicted lower PSA-PFS (HR 3.3, 95% CI 1.4-7.9 and HR 1.8, 95% CI 1.02-3.3, respectively) to taxanes. When prior A/E was administered, TMPRSS2-ERG was not associated with outcome. There was a significant interaction between blood TMPRSS2-ERG and prior A/E related to PSA-PFS (p = 0.032) and RX-PFS (p = 0.009). In vitro stable ERG inhibition did not sensitize VCaP cells to docetaxel. Concomitant enzalutamide and taxanes were synergistic, but prior enzalutamide reduced docetaxel cytotoxicity in VCaP cells. Enzalutamide induced the expression of neuroendocrine markers and reduced that of E-cadherin. We conclude that prior hormone-therapy may influence taxanes response and TMPRSS2-ERG prognostic value.

The purpose of this study is to analyze the long-term outcome.  Methods:   Ninety-two patients with localized prostate cancer treated with HIMRT at Hidaka Hospital between 2007 and 2009 were retrospectively analyzed. HIMRT was delivered using TomoTherapy. The prescription dose was 66 Gy at 95% of the PTV in 22 fractions performed 3 days a week over 7 weeks in all patients. The overall survival rate, biochemical relapse-free rate, and acute and late toxicities were evaluated.  Results:   The median follow-up duration was 78 (range 14-100) months. The median age at the start of the HIMRT was 72 (range 46-84) years. The disease characteristics were as follows: stage T1c, 45; T2a, 20; T2b, 5; T2c, 1; T3a, 13; T3b, 6; T4, 2; Gleason score 6, 13; 7, 44; 8, 20; 9, 15; 10, 0; pretreatment PSA ≤10 ng/mL, 42; 10 to ≤20, 27; and >20, 23.

The overall survival rate, the cause-specific survival rate, and the biochemical relapse-free rate at 5 years was 94.7%, 100% and 98.9%, respectively. Severe acute toxicity (grade 3 or more) was not observed. The late urinary toxicity was 52.2% in grade 0, 28.3% in grade 1, 19.6% in grade 2, and 2.2% in grade 3.

To facilitate this step of ORP, we have developed a simple and reproducible technique and reported our 8-year experience.  Materials and methods:   We used two extra-long DeBakey tissue forceps to approximate the bladder neck to the urethral stump. We found it more beneficial than Babcock clamp especially in obese patients with excess fatty tissue in the pelvic area. In this technique, the surgeon's assistant creates more space for the surgeon's hand by sweeping the fatty tissue away from the anastomotic area and then pushes the reconstructed bladder neck down while the sutures are being tied.  Results:   We analyzed data from 200 patients with prostatic cancer who underwent open radical prostatectomy performed from 2009 to 2017. There were only 2 sutures disrupted during knot tying. In two cases (1%), drain output was more than 30 mL/day on postoperative day 2 and drainage was left in place for a longer duration. With the help of medications, time voiding and dedicated pelvic floor exercise whenever needed,.the goal of full urinary continence (0- 1 pad/day) was achieved in 85%, 94% and 98% of patients immediately after catheter removal, 3 months and 6 months after surgery, respectively. Eight patients (4%) developed urethral stricture.  Conclusion:   The surgical technique has been shown to be an independent predictor of urinary continence. We introduce a new simple modification of vesicourethral anastomosis during RP. Using this technique; in addition to reducing anastomotic disruption rate and increasing knot tying control, postoperative urinary continence after ORP may also be improved.""","""['Abbas Basiri', 'Seyed Hossein Hosseini Sharifi']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Urol J""","""['Urethral-fixation technique improves early urinary continence recovery in patients who undergo retropubic radical prostatectomy.', 'Vesicourethral anastomosis including rhabdosphincter in retropubic radical prostatectomy: Technique and results.', 'Vesicourethral anastomosis during radical retropubic prostatectomy: does the number of sutures matter?', 'Simplified vesico-urethral anastomosis after radical retropubic prostatectomy for cancer.

Until recently, diagnostic and therapeutic efforts have focused exclusively on targeting characteristics of the tumor epithelium, ignoring opportunities to target inflammatory infiltrate and extracellular matrix components. Prostate tumors are rich in tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), which can be either of the cytotoxic M1 or protumorigenic M2 phenotype. We have quantified the proportion of each in seven common human prostate tumor lines grown subcutaneously in athymic nude mice and have imaged macrophage densities in vivo in xenografts derived from these lines.  Procedures:   A panel of seven human prostate cancer xenografts was generated in intact male athymic nude mice reflecting variable expression of the androgen receptor (AR) and prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA). Mice were imaged ex vivo using near-infrared fluorescence (NIRF) imaging for PSMA expression and total macrophage densities to enable direct comparison between the two. Tumors were harvested for sectioning and additional staining to delineate M1 and M2 phenotype along with vascular density.  Results:   Macrophage polarization analysis of sections revealed that all xenografts were > 94% M2 phenotype, and the few M1-polarized macrophages present were confined to the periphery. Xenografts displaying the fastest growth were associated with the highest densities of macrophages while the slowest growing tumors were characterized by focal, tumor-infiltrating macrophage densities.

Methods:   We calculated age, year, sex, and race-adjusted standardized incidence ratios (SIR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for cancer sites in the AHS relative to the general population.

Thus, there is an urgent need to develop more effective treatments beyond hormonal manipulation. We sought to identify activated kinases in mCRPC as therapeutic targets for existing, approved agents, with the goal of identifying candidate drugs for rapid translation into proof of concept Phase II trials in mCRPC.  Methods:   To identify evidence of activation of druggable kinases in these patients, we compared mRNA expression from metastatic biopsies of patients with mCRPC (n = 101) to mRNA expression in localized prostate from TCGA and used this analysis to infer differential kinase activity. In addition, we assessed the differential phosphorylation levels for key MAPK pathway kinases between mCRPC and localized prostate cancers.  Results:   Transcriptomic profiling of 101 patients with mCRPC as compared to patients with localized prostate cancer identified evidence of hyperactive ERK1, and whole genome sequencing revealed frequent amplifications of members of the MAPK pathway in 32% of this cohort. Next, we confirmed elevated levels of phosphorylated ERK1/2 in castration resistant prostate cancer as compared to untreated primary prostate cancer. We observed that the presence of detectable phosphorylated ERK1/2 in the primary tumor is associated with biochemical failure after radical prostatectomy independent of clinicopathologic features. ERK1 is the immediate downstream target of MEK1/2, which is druggable with trametinib, an approved therapeutic for melanoma. Trametinib elicited a profound biochemical and clinical response in a patient who had failed multiple prior treatments for mCRPC.  Conclusions:   We conclude that pharmacologic targeting of the MEK/ERK pathway may be a viable treatment strategy for patients with refractory metastatic prostate cancer.

Results:   Twelve patients (35%) had elevated LDH (≥255 U/l). Their median survival was significantly shorter than that of patients with normal LDH. Due to an interaction with other biomarkers, multivariate Cox regression analysis was performed. The latter showed that serum hemoglobin was the only significant predictor of survival.

Yes-associated protein (YAP) is a major cell mechano-transducer, and we show that UBTD1 is associated with components of the YAP degradation complex. Interestingly, UBTD1 promotes the interaction of YAP with its E3 ubiquitin ligase β-TrCP Consequently, in cancer cells, UBTD1 depletion decreases YAP ubiquitylation and triggers robust ROCK2-dependent YAP activation and downstream signaling.

Methods:   Twenty-five men recently diagnosed with localised prostate cancer completed semi-structured interviews asking about information/decision-making needs before and/or after attending a combined clinic in which they consulted a urologist and a radiation oncologist regarding treatment options. Data was transcribed verbatim and thematically analysed.  Results:   Most men preferred robotic prostatectomy pre-combined clinic and chose it afterwards. The thematic analysis revealed four themes: 1) trust in clinicians and the information they provide is critical for treatment choice, 2) perceived fit between treatment characteristics and personal circumstances, 3) additional considerations: specific side effects, socio-emotional and financial factors, and 4) need for tailored information delivery. Robotic prostatectomy was mistakenly believed to provide a more definitive cure than radiotherapy, which was seen as having a lesser lifestyle impact.  Conclusions:   Treatment choice is largely dependent on clinicians' (mainly urologists') recommendations.

An anthropomorphic head phantom was scanned for verification of noise reduction. Clinical patient image data sets for 5 head/neck patients and 5 prostate patients were qualitatively evaluated.  Results:   Quality assurance phantom study results showed that relative to filtered back-projection-based cone-beam computed tomography, noise was reduced from 28.8 ± 0.3 HU to a range between 18.3 ± 0.2 and 5.9 ± 0.2 HU for Full-Fan Head scans, from 14.4 ± 0.2 HU to a range between 12.8 ± 0.3 and 5.2 ± 0.3 HU for Half-Fan Head scans, and from 6.2 ± 0.1 HU to a range between 3.8 ± 0.1 and 2.0 ± 0.2 HU for Pelvis scans, with the iterative cone-beam computed tomography algorithm. Spatial resolution was marginally improved while results for uniformity and HU constancy were similar.

The patient data study showed that artifacts due to photon starvation and streak artifacts were all reduced, and image noise in specified target regions were reduced to 62% ± 15% for 10 patients.

The purpose of this work is to investigate the feasibility of using a pretrained deep convolutional neural network for similarity measurement in image registration of 3-dimensional transperineal ultrasound prostate images.  Methods:   We propose convolutional neural network-based registration that maximizes a similarity score between 2 identical in size 3-dimensional regions of interest: one encompassing the prostate within a simulation (reference) 3-dimensional ultrasound image and another that sweeps different spatial locations around the expected prostate position within a pretreatment 3-dimensional ultrasound image. The similarity score is calculated by (1) extracting pairs of corresponding 2-dimensional slices (patches) from the regions of interest, (2) providing these pairs as an input to a pretrained convolutional neural network which assigns a similarity score to each pair, and (3) calculating an overall similarity by summing all pairwise scores. The convolutional neural network method was evaluated against ground truth registrations determined by matching implanted fiducial markers visualized in a pretreatment orthogonal pair of x-ray images. The convolutional neural network method was further compared to manual registration and a standard commonly used intensity-based automatic registration approach based on advanced normalized correlation.  Results:   For 83 image pairs from 5 patients, convolutional neural network registration errors were smaller than 5 mm in 81% of the cases. In comparison, manual registration errors were smaller than 5 mm in 61% of the cases and advanced normalized correlation registration errors were smaller than 5 mm only in 25% of the cases.  Conclusion:   Convolutional neural network evaluation against manual registration and an advanced normalized correlation -based registration demonstrated better accuracy and reliability of the convolutional neural network. This suggests that with training on a large data set of transperineal ultrasound prostate images, the convolutional neural network method has potential for robust ultrasound-to-ultrasound registration.""","""['Ning Zhu', 'Mohammad Najafi', 'Bin Han', 'Steven Hancock', 'Dimitre Hristov']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Technol Cancer Res Treat""","""['Incorporating imaging information from deep neural network layers into image guided radiation therapy (IGRT).', 'Label-driven magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) registration using weakly supervised learning for MRI-guided prostate radiotherapy.', 'Fast contour propagation for MR-guided prostate radiotherapy using convolutional neural networks.', 'Clinical evaluation of an MRI-to-ultrasound deformable image registration algorithm for prostate brachytherapy.', 'Multimodal 3D ultrasound and CT in image-guided spinal surgery: public database and new registration algorithms.', 'Artificial intelligence applications in prostate cancer.']"""

Molecular modeling revealed that the compound 4d binds through hydrophobic-hydrophobic interactions with the essential amino acids (LEU: 57, GLY: 58, ILE: 61, and HIS: 96) in the p53-binding cleft, as a standard p53-MDM2 inhibitor (6SJ). The mechanism underlying the anticancer activity of compound 4d was further evaluated, and the study showed that compound 4d inhibited colony formation, cell migration, arrested cancer cell growth at G2/M, and induced apoptosis through intrinsic and extrinsic pathways. Transactivation of p53 was confirmed by flow cytometry, where compound 4d increased the level of activated p53 and induced mRNA levels of cell cycle inhibitor, p21.""","""['Assem Barakat', 'Mohammad Shahidul Islam', 'Hussien Mansur Ghawas', 'Abdullah Mohammed Al-Majid', 'Fardous F El-Senduny', 'Farid A Badria', 'Yaseen A M M Elshaier', 'Hazem A Ghabbour']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Bioorg Chem""","""[""One-pot synthesis of spiro(indoline-3,4'-pyrazolo3,4-bpyridine)-5'-carbonitriles as p53-MDM2 interaction inhibitors."", 'Molecular hybridization design and synthesis of novel spirooxindole-based MDM2 inhibitors endowed with BCL2 signaling attenuation; a step towards the next generation p53 activators.', 'Synthesis of new thiazolo-pyrrolidine-(spirooxindole) tethered to 3-acylindole as anticancer agents.', 'Spiro-oxindoles as a Promising Class of Small Molecule Inhibitors of p53-MDM2 Interaction Useful in Targeted Cancer Therapy.', 'Molecular modeling approaches in the discovery of new drugs for anti-cancer therapy: the investigation of p53-MDM2 interaction and its inhibition by small molecules.', 'Optimized spirooxindole-pyrazole hybrids targeting the p53-MDM2 interplay induce apoptosis and synergize with doxorubicin in A549 cells.', 'Synthesis, Characterization, and Cytotoxicity of New Spirooxindoles Engrafted Furan Structural Motif as a Potential Anticancer Agent.', 'Design, Synthesis and In Vitro Evaluation of Spirooxindole-Based Phenylsulfonyl Moiety as a Candidate Anti-SAR-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV-2 with the Implementation of Combination Studies.', 'Synthesis and Structure Elucidation of Novel Spirooxindole Linked to Ferrocene and Triazole Systems via 3 + 2 Cycloaddition Reaction.', 'Design, Synthesis, Chemical and Biochemical Insights Into Novel Hybrid Spirooxindole-Based p53-MDM2 Inhibitors With Potential Bcl2 Signaling Attenuation.']"""

It consists of doxorubicin (Dox) conjugated to a prostate specific antigen (PSA)-cleavable peptide that can be selectively activated by secreted PSA at the tumor site. However, despite the initial promising results, further clinical testing with Dox-PSA was halted due to toxicity concerns emerging from non-PSA-specific cleavage, following systemic administration. In the present study, we have reported, for the first time, the intracellular activation of Dox-PSA, where Dox nuclear uptake was specific to C4-2B (PSA-expressing) cells, which agreed with the cytotoxicity studies. This finding was confirmed by encapsulating Dox-PSA prodrug into pH-sensitive liposomes to enable prodrug intracellular release, followed by its enzymatic activation. Interestingly, our results demonstrated that Dox-PSA loaded into pH-responsive nanoparticles exhibited cytotoxicity comparable to free prodrug in C4-2B monolayers, with superior activity in tumor spheroids, due to deeper penetration within tumor spheroids. Our approach could open the doors for novel Dox-PSA nanomedicines with higher safety and efficacy to treat advanced and metastatic prostate cancer.""","""['Sara G T Pereira', 'Samo Hudoklin', 'Mateja Erdani Kreft', 'Nina Kostevsek', 'Marc C A Stuart', 'Wafa T Al-Jamal']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Mol Pharm""","""['Correction to ""Intracellular Activation of a Prostate Specific Antigen-Cleavable Doxorubicin Prodrug: A Key Feature Toward Prodrug-Nanomedicine Design"".', 'Encapsulation of doxorubicin prodrug in heat-triggered liposomes overcomes off-target activation for advanced prostate cancer therapy.', 'In vivo activity of a PSA-activated doxorubicin prodrug against PSA-producing human prostate cancer xenografts.', 'The synthesis of a prodrug of doxorubicin designed to provide reduced systemic toxicity and greater target efficacy.', 'Enzymatic activation of a doxorubicin-peptide prodrug by prostate-specific antigen.', 'Targeted prodrug approaches for hormone refractory prostate cancer.', 'Remodelling of the tumour microenvironment by the kallikrein-related peptidases.', 'Novel Selectively Targeted Multifunctional Nanostructured Lipid Carriers for Prostate Cancer Treatment.', 'A Simple and Effective ""Elimination"" Approach for Selective Cancer Therapy to Reveal the Role of H2O2.']"""

It is suggested that this is due to increased clearance of docetaxel in mCRPC patients, resulting in decreased exposure. The aims of this study were to (1) determine if exposure in mCRPC patients is lower vs patients with other solid tumors by conducting a meta-analysis, (2) evaluate the incidence of neutropenia in patients with mCRPC vs other solid tumors in a clinical cohort, and (3) discuss potential clinical consequences. A meta-analysis was conducted of studies which reported areas under the plasma concentration-time curves (AUCs) of docetaxel and variability. In addition, grade 3/4 neutropenia was evaluated using logistic regression in a cohort of patients treated with docetaxel. The meta-analysis included 36 cohorts from 26 trials (n = 1150 patients), and showed that patients with mCRPC had a significantly lower mean AUC vs patients with other solid tumors (fold change [95% confidence interval (CI)]: 1.8 [1.5-2.2]), with corresponding AUCs of 1.82 and 3.30 mg∙h/L, respectively.

To evaluate which factors influence postoperative continence recovery in order to obtain a nomogram to predict the risk of postoperative urinary incontinence (UI).  Patients and methods:   The enrolment phase began in June 2013 and ended in May 2017. Patients were prospectively included in the study with the following inclusion criteria: (i) localised prostate cancer (clinical stages cT1-3, cN0, cM0); (ii) indication for RP; and (iii) preoperative multiparametric prostate magnetic resonance imaging. All patients underwent RARP with the TAR technique done at the end of the demolitive phase. The continence rates were assessed at 24 h, and 1, 4, 12, 24 and 48 weeks after catheter removal. Patients were defined as continent if they answered 'zero pad' or 'one safety pad' per day. A logistic regression model was used to evaluate the potential impact of some pre- and intraoperative factors on postoperative urinary continence recovery. Model discrimination was assessed using an area under (AUC) the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. A nomogram to predict the risk of postoperative UI after RARP with the TAR technique was generated based on the logistic model.  Results:   In all, 1008 patients were enrolled in our study. At 24 h, and 1, 4, 12, 24 and 48 weeks after catheter removal, 621 (61.61%), 594 (58.93%), 803 (79.66%), 912 (90.48%), 950 (94.25%) and 956 (94.84%) patients were continent, respectively. In the logistic regression model, the variables analysed had a higher impact on continence recovery at 4 and 12 weeks. At 4 weeks, the postoperative odds of urinary continence recovery increased with the absence of diabetes [odds ratio (OR) 2.76, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.41-5.41] and D'Amico low vs high risk (OR 2.01, 95% CI 1.01-3.99). At 12 weeks, urinary continence increased with the absence of diabetes (OR 3.01, 95% CI 1.23-7.35), D'Amico low vs high risk (OR 4.04, 95% CI 1.56-10.47), and D'Amico intermediate vs high risk (OR 3.33, 95% CI 1.66-6.70). ROC curves were drawn and an AUC value of 61.9% (95% CI 57.49-66.36) at 4 weeks and 63.8% (95% CI 58.03-69.65) at 12 weeks were computed. Based on these parameters, two nomograms (at 4 and 12 weeks postoperatively) were generated.  Conclusion:   The TAR technique conferred excellent results in the early recovery of urinary continence.

In cultured prostate stem cells, decline in ARSB increased Wnt signaling through effects on Dickkopf Wnt Signaling Pathway Inhibitor (DKK)3. The effects of androgen exposure on ARSB and the impact of decline in ARSB on Wnt signaling in prostate tissue were unknown.  Methods:   Epithelial and stromal tissues from malignant and normal human prostate were obtained by laser capture microdissection. mRNA expression of ARSB, galactose-6-sulfate-sulfatase (GALNS) and Wnt-signaling targets was determined by QPCR. Non-malignant human epithelial and stromal prostate cells were grown in tissue culture, including two-cell layer cultures. ARSB was silenced by specific siRNA, and epithelial cells were treated with stromal spent media following treatment with IWP-2, an inhibitor of Wnt secretion, and by exogenous recombinant human Wnt3A. Promoter methylation was detected using specific DKK3 and ARSB promoter primers. The effects of DHT and of ARSB overexpression on DKK expression were determined. Cell proliferation was assessed by BrdU incorporation.  Results:   Normal stroma showed higher expression of vimentin, ARSB, and Wnt3A than epithelium. Normal epithelium had higher expression of E-cadherin, galactose 6-sulfate-sulfatase (GALNS), and DKK3 than stroma. In malignant epithelium, expression of ARSB and DKK3 declined, and expression of GALNS and Wnt signaling targets increased. In cultured prostate epithelial cells, Wnt-mediated signaling was greatest when ARSB was silenced and cells were exposed to exogenous Wnt3A. Exposure to 5α-dihydrotestosterone (DHT) increased ARSB and DKK3 promoter rmethylation, and effects of DHT on DKK3 expression were reversed when ARSB was overexpressed.

Methods:   Secondary linear regression analyses of data from a dose-escalation study of prostate cancer patients [n = 47; mean ± SEM age: 60 ± 1 y; BMI (in kg/m2): 32 ± 1] consuming 0, 1, or 2 cans of tomato-soy juice/d (163 mL/can; 20.6 mg lycopene 1.2 mg β-carotene/can) for 24 ± 0.7 d before prostatectomy were conducted to explore 11 SNP genotype effects on the change in plasma lycopene and plasma and prostate tissue concentrations of lycopene, β-carotene, phytoene, and phytofluene.  Results:   Two BCO1 SNP genotypes were significant predictors of the change in plasma lycopene, with SNP effects differing in magnitude and direction, depending on the level of juice intake (rs12934922 × diet group P = 0.02; rs6564851 × diet group P = 0.046). Further analyses suggested that plasma β-carotene changes were predicted by BCO1 rs12934922 (P < 0.01), prostate lycopene by trending interaction and main effects of BCO1 SNPs (rs12934922 × diet group P = 0.09; rs12934922 P = 0.02; rs6564851 P = 0.053), and prostate β-carotene by BCO1 SNP interaction and main effects (rs12934922 × diet group P = 0.01; rs12934922 P < 0.01; rs7501331 P = 0.02).  Conclusions:   In conclusion, SNPs in BCO1 and other genes may modulate human plasma and prostate tissue responses to dietary lycopene intake and warrant validation in larger, human controlled feeding intervention and cohort studies.

However, ADT does not prevent the progression of prostate cancer over the long term, and the disease eventually progresses to castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Prior to the development of enzalutamide (ENZ) and abiraterone acetate, docetaxel was the only established treatment with life-prolongation for CRPC. ENZ is a second-generation anti-androgen receptor drug that has contributed to improving the prognosis of CRPC. Several studies have reported factors predicting the efficacy of ENZ; however, there are no confirmed biomarkers. The neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) is an easily calculated biomarker that is associated with the prognosis of several solid malignancies. However, there were few studies investigated NLR for ENZ in patients with mCRPC. We examined the usefulness of the NLR as a predictive tool for ENZ.  Methods:   We retrospectively examined a total of 106 CRPC patients who were treated with ENZ until September 2016 in Yokohama City University Hospital, Yokohama City University Medical Center, and National Cancer Center Hospital East. ENZ was routinely started as a dose of 160 mg per day; the dosage was reduced in some patients due to side effects. Drug holiday for 1-2 weeks or dose reduction to 80-120mg was done and no patients discontinued ENZ treatment due to adverse effects. ENZ was stopped when cancer progression was detected based on PSA elevation, radiographic findings, and deterioration of the patient's performance status. The cut-off NLRs for overall survival (OS) and cancer-specific survival (CSS) were determined based on the receiver-operator curves. Kaplan-Meier curves were used to analyze the factors associated with OS or CSS and a log-rank test was performed. A multivariate analysis was also performed to analyze the factors associated with the prognosis.  Results:   We retrospectively reviewed 106 consecutive CRPC patients who were both treated with ENZ and were able to be counted before ENZ NLR. Cut-off point was 2.14 for both OS and CSS by receiver operator characteristic curve. The patients were then divided into the higher NLR group (≥2.14) and lower NLR group (<2.14). Multivariate analysis showed that NLR and predocetaxel chemotherapy were independent risk factors for both overall and cancer-specific survival.  Conclusions:   The NLR might be a useful biomarker for predicting the prognosis of mCRPC patients who are treated with ENZ.""","""['Yohei Kumano', 'Yoriko Hasegawa', 'Takashi Kawahara', 'Masato Yasui', 'Yasuhide Miyoshi', 'Nobuaki Matsubara', 'Hiroji Uemura']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Biomed Res Int""","""['A high neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio is a poor prognostic factor for castration-resistant prostate cancer patients who undergo abiraterone acetate or enzalutamide treatment.', 'Abiraterone Acetate and Enzalutamide: Similar Efficacy in Treating Post Docetaxel Metastatic Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer: Single Center Experience.', 'Independent association between time to prostate-specific antigen (PSA) nadir and PSA progression-free survival in patients with docetaxel-naïve, metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer receiving abiraterone acetate, but not enzalutamide.', 'Pharmacotherapeutic strategies for castrate-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Enzalutamide after docetaxel and abiraterone acetate treatment in prostate cancer: a pooled analysis of 10 case series.', 'Genomic and Phenotypic Biomarkers for Precision Medicine Guidance in Advanced Prostate Cancer.', 'Predicting postoperative gastric cancer prognosis based on inflammatory factors and machine learning technology.', 'A high monocyte-to-lymphocyte ratio predicts poor prognosis in patients with radical cystectomy for bladder cancer.', 'Pretreatment neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio is a predictive biomarker for EGFR TKI-treated patients with advanced EGFR-mutant Non-small cell lung cancer.', 'Biomarkers for Treatment Response in Advanced Prostate Cancer.']"""

Although the mechanisms of cell kill are similar for all forms of radiation, the in vivo properties of photon and proton beams differ greatly and maybe exploited to optimize clinical outcomes. In particular, proton particles lose energy in a predictable manner as they pass through the body. This property is used clinically to control the depth at which the proton beam is terminated, and to limit radiation dose beyond the target region. This strategy can allow for substantial reductions in radiation dose to normal tissues located just beyond a tumor target. However, the degradation of proton energy in the body remains highly sensitive to tissue density. As a consequence, any changes in tissue density during the course of treatment may significantly alter proton dosimetry. Such changes may occur through alterations in body weight, respiration, or bowel filling/gas, and may result in unfavorable dose deposition. In this manuscript, we provide a detailed method for the delivery of proton therapy using both passive scatter and pencil beam scanning techniques for prostate cancer. Although the described procedure directly pertains to prostate cancer patients, the method may be adapted and applied for the treatment of virtually all solid tumors. Our aim is to equip readers with a better understanding of proton therapy delivery and outcomes in order to facilitate the appropriate integration of this modality during cancer therapy.""","""['Adeel Kaiser', 'John G Eley', 'Nasarachi E Onyeuku', 'Stephanie R Rice', 'Carleen C Wright', 'Nathan E McGovern', 'Megan Sank', 'Mingyao Zhu', 'Zeljko Vujaskovic', 'Charles B Simone nd', 'Arif Hussain']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""J Vis Exp""","""['Inclusion of a variable RBE into proton and photon plan comparison for various fractionation schedules in prostate radiation therapy.', 'Clinical controversies: proton radiation therapy for brain and skull base tumors.', 'Spatially fractionated (GRID) radiation therapy using proton pencil beam scanning (PBS): Feasibility study and clinical implementation.', 'Validation of an in-vivo proton beam range check method in an anthropomorphic pelvic phantom using dose measurements.', 'Protons vs Photons for Brain and Skull Base Tumors.', 'Editorial: Combining multiple non-invasive images and/or biochemical tests to predict prostate cancer aggressiveness.', 'Chromatin and the Cellular Response to Particle Radiation-Induced Oxidative and Clustered DNA Damage.', 'A review of radiation-induced lymphopenia in patients with esophageal cancer: an immunological perspective for radiotherapy.', 'Surgical excision and postoperative radiotherapy for keloids.']"""

However, little is known about their short- and long-term efficacy and whether designing fact boxes to present multiple outcomes with icon arrays would increase their efficacy.  Method:   In study 1, 120 men (30-75 y) completed a lab study. Participants were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 fact box formats on prostate cancer screening: a tabular fact box with numbers, a fact box with numbers and icon array, and a fact box with numbers, separate icon arrays, and text to describe each benefit and harm. Comprehension of information (while materials were present) and short-term knowledge recall were assessed. Study 2 recruited an online sample of 244 German men (40-75 y). Participants were randomly assigned to 1 of the 3 fact box formats or widely distributed health information, and knowledge was assessed at baseline, shortly after presentation, and at 6-mo follow-up, along with comprehension while materials were present.  Results:   In both studies, comprehension and knowledge-recall scores were similar when comparing tabular and icon fact boxes. In the 6-mo follow-up, this positive effect on knowledge recall disappeared. Fact boxes increased knowledge relative to baseline but did not affect decision intentions or perceptions of having complete information to make decisions.  Conclusions:   This study shows that fact boxes with and without icon arrays are equally effective at improving comprehension and knowledge recall over the short-term and are simple formats that can improve on current health information. Specifically, if fact boxes are used at the time or immediately before a decision is made, they promote informed decisions about prostate cancer screening.""","""['Michelle McDowell', 'Gerd Gigerenzer', 'Odette Wegwarth', 'Felix G Rebitschek']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Med Decis Making""","""[""Risk communication in tables versus text: a registered report randomized trial on 'fact boxes'."", 'Understanding the Harms and Benefits of Cancer Screening: A Model of Factors That Shape Informed Decision Making.', 'A Comparative Effectiveness Trial of Alternate Formats for Presenting Benefits and Harms Information for Low-Value Screening Services: A Randomized Clinical Trial.', 'Screening for prostate cancer: the current evidence and guidelines controversy.', 'American Urological Association (AUA) guideline on prostate cancer detection: process and rationale.', ""Effect of different visual presentations on the public's comprehension of prognostic information using acute and chronic condition scenarios: two online randomised controlled trials."", ""Efficacy of Three Numerical Presentation Formats on Lay People's Comprehension and Risk Perception of Fact Boxes-A Randomized Controlled Pilot Study."", 'Investigating the presentation of uncertainty in an icon array: A randomized trial.', 'Educating physicians on strong opioids by descriptive versus simulated-experience formats: a randomized controlled trial.', 'Fact boxes that inform individual decisions may contribute to a more positive evaluation of COVID-19 vaccinations at the population level.']"""

The prevalence of Pca has been decreasing in recent reports. However, no study has reported trends in Pca prevalence or RP rate according to age structural changes. The objective of this study was to investigate trends in Pca prevalence and frequency of RP according to age structural change.  Materials and methods:   We evaluated trends in Pca prevalence and RP rate using National Health Insurance Data from 2005 to 2015. Relationships for Pca prevalence and RP rate with age structural change were also determined. Primary outcomes included trends in Pca prevalence and RP rates according to age groups, comparing those before and after 2011.  Results:   Pca prevalence tended to increase before 2011 and decreased after 2011 in persons in the 60-years age group. RP rate increased pattern before 2011 and decreased after 2011 in age groups of 50s, 60s, and over 70s. Pca prevalence and age structural change showed a significantly positive relationship in all age groups, except for the age group under 40 years. RP rate and age structural change also showed a significantly positive relationship in all age groups.  Conclusion:   Age structural change can affect the decreasing trend in Pca prevalence and RP rate in South Korea.

Objective:   To test the impact of HT duration among patients treated with postprostatectomy RT, stratified by clinical and pathologic characteristics.  Design, setting, and participants:   The study included 1264 patients who received salvage RT (SRT) to the prostatic and seminal vesicle bed at eight referral centers after radical prostatectomy (RP). Patients received SRT for either rising prostate-specific antigen (PSA) or PSA persistence after RP, defined as PSA ≥0.1ng/ml at 1mo after surgery. Administration of concomitant HT was at the discretion of the treating physician.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   The outcome of interest was clinical recurrence (CR) after SRT, as identified by imaging. Multivariable Cox regression analysis was used to test the association between CR and HT duration. We applied an interaction test between HT duration and baseline risk factors to assess the hypothesis that CR-free survival differed by HT duration according to patient profile. Three risk factors were prespecified for evaluation: pT stage ≥pT3b, pathologic Gleason ≥8, and PSA level at SRT >0.5 ng/ml. The relationship between HT duration and CR-free survival rate at 8yr was graphically explored according to the number of risk factors (0 vs 1 vs ≥2).  Results and limitations:   Overall, 1125 men (89%) received SRT for rising PSA and 139 (11%) were treated for PSA persistence. Concomitant HT was administered to 363 patients (29%), with a median HT duration of 9mo. At median follow-up of 93mo after surgery, 182 patients developed CR. The 8-yr CR-free survival was 92%. On multivariable analysis, HT duration was inversely associated with the risk of CR (hazard ratio 0.95; p=0.022). A total of 531 (42%) patients had none of the prespecified risk factors, while 507 (40%) had one and 226 (18%) had two or more risk factors. The association between HT duration and CR was significantly different by risk factors (0 vs 1, p=0.001; 0 vs ≥2, p<0.0001). We observed a significant effect of HT duration for patients with two or more risk factors, for whom HT administration was beneficial when given for up to 36mo. This effect was attenuated among patients with one risk factor, with concomitant HT slightly beneficial when administered for a shorter time (<12mo). Conversely, for patients with no risk factors, the risk of CR remained low and constant regardless of HT duration.  Conclusions:   The oncologic benefit of HT duration among men receiving SRT for increasing PSA after RP depends on their clinical and pathologic characteristics. Our data suggested a significant effect of long-term HT for patients with two or more adverse features. Conversely, short-term HT was sufficient for patients with a single risk factor, whereas patients without any risk factors did not show a significant benefit from concomitant HT.  Patient summary:   We tested the impact of hormonal therapy (HT) duration during radiation therapy after radical prostatectomy. We identified three risk factors and observed a different impact of HT duration by clinical and pathologic characteristics. Patients with more adverse features benefit from long-term concomitant HT. On the contrary, for patients with a single risk factor, short-term HT may be reasonable. Patients without any risk factors did not show a significant benefit from concomitant HT.""","""['Nicola Fossati', 'Daniele Robesti', 'R Jeffrey Karnes', 'Matteo Soligo', 'Stephen A Boorjian', 'Alberto Bossi', 'Gabriele Coraggio', 'Nadia Di Muzio', 'Cesare Cozzarini', 'Barbara Noris Chiorda', 'Giorgio Gandaglia', 'Simone Scarcella', 'Detlef Bartkowiak', 'Dirk Böhmer', 'Shahrokh Shariat', 'Gregor Goldner', 'Antonino Battaglia', 'Steven Joniau', 'Karin Haustermans', 'Gert De Meerleer', 'Valérie Fonteyne', 'Piet Ost', 'Hein Van Poppel', 'Francesco Montorsi', 'Thomas Wiegel', 'Alberto Briganti']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Eur Urol""","""['Androgen Deprivation Therapy with Postprostatectomy Radiotherapy: For Whom and for How Long?', 'Assessing the Optimal Timing for Early Salvage Radiation Therapy in Patients with Prostate-specific Antigen Rise After Radical Prostatectomy.', 'Use of Concomitant Androgen Deprivation Therapy in Patients Treated with Early Salvage Radiotherapy for Biochemical Recurrence After Radical Prostatectomy: Long-term Results from a Large, Multi-institutional Series.', 'Long-term Impact of Adjuvant Versus Early Salvage Radiation Therapy in pT3N0 Prostate Cancer Patients Treated with Radical Prostatectomy: Results from a Multi-institutional Series.', 'Optimizing the Timing of Salvage Postprostatectomy Radiotherapy and the Use of Concurrent Hormonal Therapy for Prostate Cancer.', 'Factors influencing biochemical recurrence in patients who have received salvage radiotherapy after radical prostatectomy: a systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Radiation Therapy After Radical Prostatectomy: What Has Changed Over Time?', 'Using CT-guided stereotactic prostate radiation therapy (CT-SPRT) to assess sustained murine prostate ablation.', 'High-Risk Prostate Cancer: A Very Challenging Disease in the Field of Uro-Oncology.']"""

Interpretation of prostate-specific antigen is both dependent on the method and cut-off. The aim of this study was to examine the effect of method-specific differences and cut-off values in a national external quality assessment scheme (EQAS).  Methods:   The Dutch EQAS for prostate-specific antigen comprised an annual distribution of 12 control materials. The results of two distributions were combined with the corresponding cut-off value. Differences between methods were quantified by simple linear regression based on the all laboratory trimmed mean. To assess the clinical consequence of method-specific differences and cut-off values, a clinical data-set of 1040 patients with an initial prostate-specific antigen measurement and concomitant conclusive prostate biopsy was retrospectively collected. Sensitivity and specificity for prostate cancer were calculated for all EQAS participants individually.  Results:   In the Netherlands, seven different prostate-specific antigen methods are used. Interestingly, 67% of these laboratories apply age-specific cut-off values. Methods showed a maximal relative difference of 26%, which were not reflected in the cut-off values. The largest differences were caused by the type of cut-off, for example in the Roche group the cut-off value differed maximal 217%. Clinically, a fixed prostate-specific antigen cut-off has a higher sensitivity than an age-specific cut-off (mean 89% range 86-93% versus 79% range 63-95%, respectively).  Conclusions:   This study shows that the differences in cut-off values exceed the method-specific differences.

Moreover, I and 4 showed mild cytotoxic effect on prostate cancer cells. Neither compound was cytotoxic towards human dermal papilla cells at 100 μg/mL.

Materials and methods:   In the present study, 154 patients with non-metastatic muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC), prospectively enrolled in the tetramodal bladder-preservation protocol, were analysed. After TURBT and induction CRT, patients showing complete remission were offered consolidative PC with PLND for the achievement of bladder preservation. Pathological response to induction CRT was evaluated using PC specimens. Oncological and functional outcomes after bladder preservation were evaluated using the following endpoints: MIBC-recurrence-free survival (RFS); cancer-specific survival (CSS); overall survival (OS), and cross-sectional assessments of preserved bladder function and quality of life (QoL) including uroflowmetry, bladder diary, International Prostate Symptom Score, Overactive Bladder Symptom Score and the 36-item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36) score.  Results:   The median follow-up period was 48 months. Complete MIBC remission was achieved in 121 patients (79%) after CRT, and 107 patients (69%) completed the tetramodal bladder-preservation protocol comprising consolidative PC with PLND. Pathological examination in these 107 patients revealed residual invasive cancer (≥pT1) that was surgically removed in 11 patients (10%) and lymph node metastases in two patients (2%). The 5-year MIBC-RFS, CSS and OS rates in the 107 patients who completed the protocol were 97%, 93% and 91%, respectively. As for preserved bladder function, the median maximum voided volume, post-void residual urine volume, and nighttime frequency were 350 mL, 25 mL, and two voids, respectively.

Development of fibrosis is typically attributed to signaling through the transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) pathway, but our laboratory has demonstrated that in vitro treatment of human prostatic fibroblasts with the C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 12 (CXCL12) chemokine stimulates myofibroblast phenoconversion and that CXCL12 has the capacity to activate profibrotic pathways in these cells in a TGF-β-independent manner. We have previously reported that feeding mice high-fat diet (HFD) results in obesity, type II diabetes, increased prostatic fibrosis, and urinary voiding dysfunction. The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that in vivo blockade of the CXCL12/CXCR4 axis would inhibit the development of fibrosis-mediated LUTD in HFD-fed mice.  Methods:   Two-month-old male senescence-accelerated mouse prone-6 mice were fed either a HFD or low-fat diet (LFD) for 8 months. Half of each dietary group were given constant access to normal water or water that contained the C-X-C chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR4; CXCL12 receptor) antagonist CXCR4AIII. At the conclusion of the study, mice were weighed, subjected to oral glucose tolerance testing and cystometry, and lower urinary tract tissues collected and assessed for collagen content.  Results:   HFD-fed mice became significantly obese, insulin resistant, and hyperglycemic, consistent with acquisition of metabolic syndrome, compared with LFD-fed mice. Anesthetized cystometry demonstrated that HFD-fed mice experienced significantly longer intercontractile intervals and greater functional bladder capacity than LFD-fed mice. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated high levels of CXCR4 and CXCR7 staining in mouse prostate epithelial and stromal cells. Picrosirius red staining indicated significantly greater periurethral collagen deposition in the prostates of HFD than LFD-fed mice. Treatment with the CXCR4 antagonist CXCR4AIII did not affect acquisition of metabolic syndrome but did reduce both urinary voiding dysfunction and periurethral prostate collagen accumulation.  Conclusions:   This is the first study to report that obesity-induced lower urinary tract fibrosis and voiding dysfunction can be repressed by antagonizing the activity of the CXCR4 chemokine receptor in vivo. These data suggest that targeting the CXCL12/CXCR4 signaling pathway may be a clinical option for the prevention or treatment of human male LUTD.""","""['Jill A Macoska', 'Zunyi Wang', 'Johanna Virta', 'Nicholas Zacharias', 'Dale E Bjorling']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['CXCL12/CXCR4 Axis Activation Mediates Prostate Myofibroblast Phenoconversion through Non-Canonical EGFR/MEK/ERK Signaling.', 'Obesity-induced diabetes and lower urinary tract fibrosis promote urinary voiding dysfunction in a mouse model.', 'Proinflammatory CXCL12-CXCR4/CXCR7 Signaling Axis Drives Myc-Induced Prostate Cancer in Obese Mice.', 'The chemokine receptors CXCR4/CXCR7 and their primary heterodimeric ligands CXCL12 and CXCL12/high mobility group box 1 in pancreatic cancer growth and development: finding flow.', 'Stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1) as a target in liver diseases.', 'Lack of expression of miR-29a/b1 impairs bladder function in male mice.', 'Current research and future directions in non-malignant urologic research - proceedings of the annual CAIRIBU meeting.', 'The IL-4/IL-13 signaling axis promotes prostatic fibrosis.', 'Inhibition of CXCR4 in Spinal Cord and DRG with AMD3100 Attenuates Colon-Bladder Cross-Organ Sensitization.', 'Treatment of Stress Urinary Incontinence with Muscle Stem Cells and Stem Cell Components: Chances, Challenges and Future Prospects.']"""

Increased smooth muscle tone in the hyperplastic prostate may drive urethral obstruction, resulting in bladder outlet obstruction and voiding symptoms. However, efficacy of α1 -blockers is limited, as non-adrenergic mediators including endothelin-1 and thromboxane A2 (TXA2 ) increase prostate smooth muscle tension in parallel to α1 -adrenoceptors. This may maintain urethral obstruction despite therapy with α1 -blockers. Consequently, future treatment options with higher efficacy need to target α1 -adrenergic and non-adrenergic contractions simultaneouly. Recently, several compounds were reported to inhibit adrenergic or neurogenic prostate contractions, however, their effects on non-adrenergic contraction are unknown. Here, we examined effects of inhibitors for Rac-GTPase, Src family kinases (SFKs), and p21-activated kinases (PAKs) on non-adrenergic prostate contractions.  Methods:   Prostate tissues were obtained from radical prostatectomy. Contractions were studied in an organ bath. Viability of cultured stromal cells was assessed by CCK-8 assay.  Results:   Inhibition of α1 -adrenergic contractions by Rac inhibitors EHT1864 (100 μM) and NSC23766 (100 μM), and SFK inhibitors AZM475721 (10 μM) and PP2 (10 μM) was confirmed by inhibition of methoxamine-induced contractions. No effects of the PAK inhibitors FRAX486 (30 μM) and IPA3 (300 μM) on α1 -adrenergic contraction were confirmed by absent effects on methoxamine-inuced contractions. EHT1864 caused inhibition of endothelin-1- and U46619-induced contractions. EHT1864 reduced the viability of stromal cells concentration- and time-dependently. EHT1864 attenuated KCl-induced contractions of prostate strips only slightly, so that toxic effects may not account alone for inhibition of agonist-induced contractions. NSC23766 inhibited U46619-induced contractions, but not endothelin-1-induced contractions. AZM475271 had no effects on endothelin-1- or U46619-induced contractions, while PP2 inhibited U46619- but not endothelin-1-induced contractions. FRAX486 caused inhibition of U46619-induced contractions. IPA3 inhibited U46619-, but not endothelin-1-induced contractions.  Conclusions:   Of all six inhibitors, EHT1864 seems to be most promising from a translational point of view, as it inhibited TXA2 - and endothelin-1-induced besides α1 -adrenergic prostate contractions. This reflects divergent pharmacologic profiles of EHT1864 and NSC23766, although both are Rac-GTPase inhibitors. In vivo, urodynamic effects of EHT1864 and possibly of FRAX486 may exceed those of α1 -blockers.""","""['Qingfeng Yu', 'Christian Gratzke', 'Yiming Wang', 'Xiaolong Wang', 'Bingsheng Li', 'Frank Strittmatter', 'Annika Herlemann', 'Ruixiao Wang', 'Alexander Tamalunas', 'Raphaela Waidelich', 'Christian G Stief', 'Martin Hennenberg']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['P21-Activated Kinase Inhibitors FRAX486 and IPA3: Inhibition of Prostate Stromal Cell Growth and Effects on Smooth Muscle Contraction in the Human Prostate.', 'Non-Adrenergic, Tamsulosin-Insensitive Smooth Muscle Contraction is Sufficient to Replace α1 -Adrenergic Tension in the Human Prostate.', 'Inhibition of human prostate stromal cell growth and smooth muscle contraction by thalidomide: A novel remedy in LUTS?', 'Prostatic α1-adrenoceptors: new concepts of function, regulation, and intracellular signaling.', 'Adrenoceptor pharmacology: urogenital applications.', 'The prostaglandin pathway is activated in patients who fail medical therapy for benign prostatic hyperplasia with lower urinary tract symptoms.', 'Concentration-dependent alpha1-Adrenoceptor Antagonism and Inhibition of Neurogenic Smooth Muscle Contraction by Mirabegron in the Human Prostate.', 'Rac1, A Potential Target for Tumor Therapy.', 'Regulation of smooth muscle contraction by monomeric non-RhoA GTPases.', 'Targeting Rac and Cdc42 GEFs in Metastatic Cancer.']"""

The progression towards resistance is difficult to directly study in heterogeneous ecological environments such as tumors. In this work, we use a micro-fabricated ""evolution accelerator"" environment to create a complex heterogeneous yet controllable in-vitro environment with a spatially-varying drug concentration. With such a structure we observe the rapid emergence of a surprisingly large number of polyploid giant cancer cells (PGCCs) in regions of very high drug concentration, which does not occur in conventional cell culture of uniform concentration. This emergence of PGCCs in a high drug environment is due to migration of diploid epithelial cells from regions of low drug concentration, where they proliferate, to regions of high drug concentration, where they rapidly convert to PGCCs. Such a mechanism can only occur in spatially-varying rather than homogeneous environments. Further, PGCCs exhibit increased expression of the mesenchymal marker ZEB1 in the same high-drug regions where they are formed, suggesting the possible induction of an epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) in these cells. This is consistent with prior work suggesting the PGCC cells are mediators of resistance in response to chemotherapeutic stress. Taken together, this work shows the key role of spatial heterogeneity and the migration of proliferative diploid cells to form PGCCs as a survival strategy for the cancer population, with implications for new therapies.""","""['Ke-Chih Lin', 'Gonzalo Torga', 'Yusha Sun', 'Robert Axelrod', 'Kenneth J Pienta', 'James C Sturm', 'Robert H Austin']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Clin Exp Metastasis""","""['Autophagy modulating therapeutics inhibit ovarian cancer colony generation by polyploid giant cancer cells (PGCCs).', 'EMT-related protein expression in polyploid giant cancer cells and their daughter cells with different passages after triptolide treatment.', 'The stem cell inhibitor salinomycin decreases colony formation potential and tumor-initiating population in docetaxel-sensitive and docetaxel-resistant prostate cancer cells.', 'Epithelial-mesenchymal plasticity of breast cancer stem cells: implications for metastasis and therapeutic resistance.', 'Targeting Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT) to Overcome Drug Resistance in Cancer.', 'Targeting polyploid giant cancer cells potentiates a therapeutic response and overcomes resistance to PARP inhibitors in ovarian cancer.', 'Cells in the polyaneuploid cancer cell (PACC) state have increased metastatic potential.', 'Nuclear morphology predicts cell survival to cisplatin chemotherapy.', 'Computational Biology Helps Understand How Polyploid Giant Cancer Cells Drive Tumor Success.', 'Insights into the role of senescence in tumor dormancy: mechanisms and applications.']"""

In order to identify appropriate ligand analogues for simultaneous inhibition of EGFR and VPAC1, in-silico homology modelling of VPAC1 and its characterization by molecular interaction studies have been undertaken. Homology modelling was performed with the Swiss Model and validation of the predicted 3D structure was carried out using PROCHECK and RAMPAGE. Ramachandran's plot of the predicted structure from this two software revealed that 92% and 94% of the residues were in the most favoured region, respectively. Compounds screened from Naturally Occurring Plant-based Anti-Cancerous Compound-Activity-Target (NPACT) database having strong interactions with EGFR were further checked for ADMET properties.

Fisetin and Genistein with a rotatable bond and lower molecular weight increased their drug-likeness than the others. Therefore, simultaneous inhibition of VPAC1 and EGFR, in turn, might inhibit the progression of breast carcinoma. The results obtained were further substantiated by comparing them with positive and negative controls. Quercetin was used as positive control, and strong binding energy of -7.54 kcal/mol with EGFR is in accordance with experimental evidence. 3-O-cis-p coumaroyl alphitolic acid was used as negative control, where docking was not possible in absence of binding with either EGFR or VIPR1.""","""['Avipsha Sarkar', 'Shampa Sen']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""J Bioenerg Biomembr""","""['A Molecular Dynamics Study of Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide Receptor 1 and the Basis of Its Therapeutic Antagonism.', 'Generation of PEGylated VPAC1-selective antagonists that inhibit proliferation of a lung cancer cell line.', 'The human VPAC1 receptor: identification of the N-terminal ectodomain as a major VIP-binding site by photoaffinity labeling and 3D modeling.', 'VPAC1 receptor binding site: contribution of photoaffinity labeling approach.', 'Class II G protein-coupled receptors for VIP and PACAP: structure, models of activation and pharmacology.', 'Cryo-EM structure of an activated VIP1 receptor-G protein complex revealed by a NanoBiT tethering strategy.', 'A Molecular Dynamics Study of Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide Receptor 1 and the Basis of Its Therapeutic Antagonism.']"""

The GPS (Oncotype Dx Genomic Prostate Score®) assay has been proposed as a predictor of more severe pathology at prostatectomy but its true clinical value is uncertain. We hypothesized that some of the predictive usefulness of this assay relates to its correlation with histopathological features which are apparent but not typically reported on prostate biopsies.  Materials and methods:   In this retrospective, single center cohort we determined an RNA based GPS of prostate biopsies. We retrospectively reviewed the histopathological features of biopsy cores with the score and assessed tumor length, Gleason pattern 4 amount and type, and stromal reaction type. Associations between the GPS and histopathological features were assessed by linear mixed models.  Results:   From May 2013 to August 2015 a GPS was determined in 319 biopsies in a total of 296 patients. Of the types of Gleason pattern 4 the expansile cribriform, simple cribriform, poorly formed and fused patterns were associated with a higher GPS. The expansile cribriform pattern had the strongest association. The glomerulation pattern was associated with a lower GPS and an increasing stromal reaction also positively correlated with the GPS. A model incorporating these pathological features accounted for 36.9% of the variation in the score.  Conclusions:   The stromal reaction and the type of Gleason pattern 4 are histopathological features which are not typically reported for prostate biopsies but they correlate with the GPS.

The discrimination power of the assay to detect high grade prostate cancer (Gleason 7 or greater) was evaluated by ROC analysis and compared to prior results. Clinical performance was further improved by comparison with multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging-ultrasound vs transrectal ultrasound guided biopsies.  Results:   The assay AUC was 0.784 for high grade vs low grade cancer/benign histology, which was superior to the AUCs of total prostate specific antigen and percent free prostate specific antigen. If 1,000 patients were biopsied, the assay would have reduced the number of unnecessary biopsies from 705 to 402 (43%) with only 22 missed high grade cancers, of which 7 would have been Gleason sum 4 + 3 or higher.

Methods:   A sandwich ELISA based on an anti-PSA IgY antibody was developed. We evaluated the ability of the anti-PSA IgY antibody to detect free and complexed PSA at the same molar ratio. The assay was optimized, and its analytical performance was verified by calculating limit of background (LoB), limit of detection (LoD), and limit of quantification (LoQ). We performed correlation and regression analyses between tPSA concentrations measured by our ELISA and those from commercial assays: Cobas 6000 (Roche Diagnostics, Warszawa, Poland) and PSA total ELISA (IBL International, Hamburg, Germany).  Results:   LoB, LoD, and LoQ, were 0.061, 0.083, and 0.100 ng/mL, respectively, and linearity range was 0.100-3.375 ng/mL. tPSA concentrations from our IgY-based ELISA strongly correlated with those from the commercial assays.  Conclusions:   Our IgY-based ELISA is an efficient equivalent to the above commercial assays. The use of IgY as the detecting agent could reduce the risk of false positive results, as well as decrease the overall cost of analysis.""","""['Agnieszka Łupicka-Słowik', 'Renata Grzywa', 'Ewa Leporowska', 'Danuta Procyk', 'Józef Oleksyszyn', 'Marcin Sieńczyk']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Ann Lab Med""","""['Generation and application of polyclonal IgY antibodies specific for full-length and nicked prostate-specific antigen.', 'Development and validation of a quantitative ELISA for the measurement of PSA concentration.', 'Comparison of the clinical validity of free prostate-specific antigen, alpha-1 antichymotrypsin-bound prostate-specific antigen and complexed prostate-specific antigen in prostate cancer diagnosis.', 'Analytical performance of a new one-step quantitative prostate-specific antigen assay, the FREND™ PSA Plus.', 'Use of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) isoforms for the detection of prostate cancer in men with a PSA level of 2-10 ng/ml: systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Kinetic Analysis of Prostate-Specific Antigen Interaction with Monoclonal Antibodies for Development of a Magnetic Immunoassay Based on Nontransparent Fiber Structures.', 'Point-of-care biochemical assays using electrochemical technologies: approaches, applications, and opportunities.', 'IgY technology: Methods for developing and evaluating avian immunoglobulins for the in vitro detection of biomolecules.', 'Label-Free Optical Resonator-Based Biosensors.', 'IgY - turning the page toward passive immunization in COVID-19 infection (Review).']"""

Considering the malignant progression and therapeutic resistance of PCa, further dissection of the underlying mechanisms and exploration of novel therapeutic targets for PCa are urgently needed. The long noncoding RNA HOTTIP has recently been revealed as an oncogenic regulator in different cancers; however, whether HOTTIP is involved in PCa remains poorly understood. Here, we examined the crucial roles of HOTTIP in the proliferation and chemoresistance of PCa.  Methods:   Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) was performed to detect the HOTTIP messenger RNA (mRNA) levels in PCa samples from patients and PCa cells. Then, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT), colony formation, and cell cycle and flow cytometry assays were performed to investigate the proliferation and cisplatin-resistance of PCa cells with silenced HOTTIP compared with a negative control. We applied Western blotting, qRT-PCR and a TOP/FOP assay to explore the relevant mechanisms.  Results:   In this study, we found that the HOTTIP mRNA levels were increased in the PCa patient samples and PCa cell lines compared with the controls. The knockdown of HOTTIP not only inhibited the proliferation of PCa cells but also facilitated cell cycle arrest and chemosensitivity to cisplatin. Furthermore, the qRT-PCR, Western blotting, TOP/FOP assays, MTT assay, and flow cytometry revealed that Wnt/β-catenin signaling was related to the regulation of HOTTIP in cell proliferation, cell cycle arrest, and chemoresistance to cisplatin in PCa.  Conclusion:   Taken together, our findings suggest that HOTTIP may be a potent therapeutic target for PCa, and HOTTIP inhibitors might be regarded as effective strategies for PCa therapy.""","""['Huichuan Jiang', 'Wei Xiong', 'Lingxiao Chen', 'Zhengtong Lv', 'Changzhao Yang', 'Yuan Li']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""J Cell Biochem""","""['Long Noncoding RNA SOX2-OT Knockdown Inhibits Proliferation and Metastasis of Prostate Cancer Cells Through Modulating the miR-452-5p/HMGB3 Axis and Inactivating Wnt/β-Catenin Pathway.', 'Long non-coding RNA HOTTIP promotes prostate cancer cells proliferation and migration by sponging miR-216a-5p.', 'Long noncoding RNA HOTTIP is a significant indicator of ovarian cancer prognosis and enhances cell proliferation and invasion.', 'The HOTTIP (HOXA transcript at the distal tip) lncRNA: Review of oncogenic roles in human.', 'Molecular Regulatory Roles of Long Non-coding RNA HOTTIP: An Overview in Gastrointestinal Cancers.', 'lncRNA PDCD4-AS1 Promotes the Progression of Glioma by Regulating miR-30b-3p/METTL7B Signaling.', 'Molecular Landscape of LncRNAs in Prostate Cancer: A focus on pathways and therapeutic targets for intervention.', 'Targeting autophagy in prostate cancer: preclinical and clinical evidence for therapeutic response.', 'Magnesium-Assisted Cisplatin Inhibits Bladder Cancer Cell Survival by Modulating Wnt/β-Catenin Signaling Pathway.', 'Oncogenic Role of Exosomal Circular and Long Noncoding RNAs in Gastrointestinal Cancers.']"""

However, significant radioresistance of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) cells constitutes a main obstacle in the treatment of this disease. By using bioinformatic data mining methods, LOXL2 was found to be upregulated in both androgen-independent prostate cancer cell lines and radioresistant tumor samples collected from patients with prostate cancer. We speculate that LOXL2 may play an important role in the radioresistance of CRPC cells.  Methods:   The effect of LOXL2 knockdown on the radiosensitivity of androgen-independent prostate cancer cells lines was measured by the clonogenic assay and xenograft tumor experiments under in vitro and in vivo conditions, respectively. In studies on the mechanism, we focused on the EMT phenotype changes and cell apoptosis changes induced by LOXL2 knockdown in DU145 cells. The protein levels of three EMT biomarkers, namely, E-cadherin, vimentin, and N-cadherin, were measured by western blotting and immunohistochemical staining. Cell apoptosis after irradiation was measured by flow cytometry and caspase-3 activity assay. Salvage experiment was also conducted to confirm the possible role of EMT in the radiosensitization effect of LOXL2 knockdown in CRPC cells.  Results:   LOXL2 knockdown in CRPC cells enhanced cellular radiosensitivity under both in vitro and in vivo conditions. A significant reversal of EMT was observed in LOXL2-silenced DU145 cells. Cell apoptosis after irradiation was significantly enhanced by LOXL2 knockdown in DU145 cells. Results from the salvage experiment confirmed the key role of EMT process reversal in the radiosensitization effect of LOXL2 knockdown in DU145 cells.  Conclusions:   LOXL2 plays an important role in the development of cellular radioresistance in CRPC cells. Targeting LOXL2 may be a rational avenue to overcome radioresistance in CRPC cells. A LOXL2-targeting strategy for CRPC treatment warrants detailed investigation in the future.""","""['Peng Xie', 'Hongliang Yu', 'Feijiang Wang', 'Feng Yan', 'Xia He']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Biomed Res Int""","""['Inhibition of LSD1 by Pargyline inhibited process of EMT and delayed progression of prostate cancer in\xa0vivo.', 'PDLIM2 suppression efficiently reduces tumor growth and invasiveness of human castration-resistant prostate cancer-like cells.', 'Epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM) is associated with prostate cancer metastasis and chemo/radioresistance via the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway.', 'Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition Signaling and Prostate Cancer Stem Cells: Emerging Biomarkers and Opportunities for Precision Therapeutics.', 'Epithelial-mesenchymal-transition regulators in prostate cancer: Androgens and beyond.', 'LOXL2 silencing suppresses angiotensin II-induced cardiac hypertrophy through the EMT process and TGF-β1/Smad3/NF-κB pathway.', 'Biological Adaptations of Tumor Cells to Radiation Therapy.', 'PLAC8 gene knockout increases the radio-sensitivity of xenograft tumors in nude mice with nasopharyngeal carcinoma by promoting apoptosis.', 'Extracellular Matrices and Cancer-Associated Fibroblasts: Targets for Cancer Diagnosis and Therapy?', 'Cell Plasticity and Prostate Cancer: The Role of Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition in Tumor Progression, Invasion, Metastasis and Cancer Therapy Resistance.']"""

Materials and methods:   Prostate cancer patients with completed PAP results were identified using the SEER database of the National Cancer Institute. The Mann-Whitney Sum test was utilized to compare the statistical significance for measurement data and ranked data. Data were stratified by ages, races, TNM Classification of Malignant Tumors (TNM), pathological grades, number of tumors, PAP, and survival duration. Multivariable logistic analysis was performed to identify predictors of the presence of invasion and metastases. Cox regression was analyzed for the factors associated with all-cause mortality and prostate cancer-specific mortality. Moreover, survival curve was used to detect the survival months. The unknown data were excluded from these tests.  Results:   In total, there are 5184 PAP+ patients and 3161 PAP- patients involved. The Mann-Whitney Sum test showed that slightly greater tumor size (P = 0.03), elevated lymphatic (P = 0.005) and distant (P < 0.001) metastasis rate, higher pathological grade (P < 0.001), localized tumor number (P < 0.001), and shortened survival months (P < 0.001) were observed in the PAP+ group compared with the PAP- group. In the multivariable logistic regression, invasion and metastasis Hazard Ratio (HR) were elevated significantly (P < 0.001) in the PAP+ individuals. In the survival analysis, PAP- patients experienced the prolonged median survival. In the postsurgical patients, the survival months were still longer in PAP+ patients compared with the negative ones (P < 0.001), though surgery prolonged the survival months of both groups. Survival months stratified by localized, invasion, and metastasis situations were analyzed. In the three stratified subgroups, the survival duration is significantly decreased in the PAP+ individuals in the localized PCa group (P < 0.001) and the metastasis group (P = 0.013).

To further simplify the dosimetry calculations in the clinical setting, to have more control over the particle size and to change the permanent embolization to a temporary one, we developed uniformly-sized, biodegradable 188Re-labeled MS (188Re-MS) as a new and easily imageable TARE agent. Methods: MS made of poly(L-lactic acid) were produced in a flow focusing microchip. The MS were labeled with 188Re using a customized kit. An orthotopic HCC animal model was developed in male Sprague Dawley rats by injecting N1-S1 cells directly into the liver using ultrasound guidance. A suspension of 188Re-MS was administered via hepatic intra-arterial catheterization 2 weeks post-inoculation of the N1-S1 cells. The rats were imaged by SPECT 1, 24, 48, and 72 h post-radioembolization. Results: The spherical 188Re-MS had a diameter of 41.8 ± 6.0 µm (CV = 14.5%). The site and the depth of the injection of N1-S1 cells were controlled by visualization of the liver in sonograms. Single 0.5 g tumors were grown in all rats. 188Re-MS accumulated in the liver with no deposition in the lungs. 188Re decays to stable 188Os by emission of β¯ particles with similar energy to those emitted by 90Y while simultaneously emitting γ photons, which were imaged directly by single photon computed tomography (SPECT). Using Monte Carlo methods, the dose to the tumors was calculated to be 3-6 times larger than to the healthy liver tissue. Conclusions:188Re-MS have the potential to become the next generation of β¯-emitting MS for TARE. Future work revolves around the investigation of the therapeutic potential of 188Re-MS in a large-scale, long-term preclinical study as well as the evaluation of the clinical outcomes of using 188Re-MS with different sizes, from 20 to 50 µm.""","""['José Carlos De La Vega', 'Pedro Luis Esquinas', 'Cristina Rodríguez-Rodríguez', 'Mehrdad Bokharaei', 'Igor Moskalev', 'David Liu', 'Katayoun Saatchi', 'Urs O Häfeli']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Theranostics""","""['Resin Versus Glass Microspheres for 90Y Transarterial Radioembolization: Comparing Survival in Unresectable Hepatocellular Carcinoma Using Pretreatment Partition Model Dosimetry.', 'Radioembolisation for hepatocellular carcinoma.', 'Feasibility of high activity rhenium-188-microsphere in hepatic radioembolization.', 'Clinical impact of (99m)Tc-MAA SPECT/CT-based dosimetry in the radioembolization of liver malignancies with (90)Y-loaded microspheres.', '(90)Y-glass microspheres for hepatic neoplasia.', 'Bench-to-bedside development of multifunctional flexible embolic agents.', 'Microspheres as a Carrier System for Therapeutic Embolization Procedures: Achievements and Advances.', 'Smart nanoparticles and microbeads for interventional embolization therapy of liver cancer: state of the art.', 'CEP192 is a novel prognostic marker and correlates with the immune microenvironment in hepatocellular carcinoma.', 'Radiometal-Labeled Chitosan Microspheres as Transarterial Radioembolization Agents against Hepatocellular Carcinoma.']"""

The mechanisms through which aberrant cellular CXCL1 levels promote specific steps in tumor growth and progression are unknown. Methods: We described the anticancer effects and mechanism of action of HL2401, a monoclonal antibody directed at CXCL1 with in vitro and in vivo data on bladder and prostate cancers. Results: HL2401 inhibited proliferation and invasion of bladder and prostate cells along with disrupting endothelial sprouting in vitro. Furthermore, novel mechanistic investigations revealed that CXCL1 expression stimulated interleukin 6 (IL6) expression and repressed tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 4 (TIMP4). Systemic administration of HL2401 in mice bearing bladder and prostate xenograft tumors retarded tumor growth through the inhibition of cellular proliferation and angiogenesis along with an induction of apoptosis. Our findings reveal a previously undocumented relationship between CXCL1, IL6 and TIMP4 in solid tumor biology. Principal conclusions: Taken together, our results argue that CXCL1 plays an important role in sustaining the growth of bladder and prostate tumors via up-regulation of IL6 and down-regulation of TIMP4.

In some tumour cells, however, strong expression of HSP90 is also observed on the cell membrane and in the extracellular matrix and the affinity of tumoural HSP90 for ATP domain inhibitors was reported to increase over 100-fold compared to that of HSP90 in normal cells. Here, we explore [11C]NMS-E973 as a PET tracer for in vivo visualisation of HSP90 and as a potential tool for in vivo quantification of occupancy of HSP90 inhibitors. Methods: HSP90 expression was biochemically characterized in a panel of established cell lines including the melanoma line B16.F10. B16.F10 melanoma xenograft tumour tissue was compared to non-malignant mouse tissue. NMS-E973 was tested in vitro for HSP90 inhibitory activity in several tumour cell lines. HSP90-specific binding of [11C]NMS-E973 was evaluated in B16.F10 melanoma cells and B16.F10 melanoma, prostate cancer LNCaP and PC3, SKOV-3 xenograft tumour slices and in vivo in a B16.F10 melanoma mouse model. Results: Strong intracellular upregulation and abundant membrane localisation of HSP90 was observed in the different tumour cell lines, in the B16.F10 tumour cell line and in B16.F10 xenograft tumours compared to non-malignant tissue. NMS-E973 showed HSP90-specific inhibition and reduced proliferation of cells. [11C]NMS-E973 showed strong binding to B16.F10 melanoma cells, which was inhibited by 200 µM of PU-H71, a non-structurally related HSP90 inhibitor. HSP90-specific binding was observed by in vitro autoradiography of murine B16.F10 melanoma, LNCaP and PC3 prostate cancer and SKOV-3 ovary carcinoma tissue slices. Further, B16.F10 melanoma-inoculated mice were subjected to a µPET study, where the tracer showed fast and persistent tumour uptake. Pretreatment of B16.F10 melanoma mice with PU-H71 or Ganetespib (50 mg/kg) completely blocked tumour accumulation of [11C]NMS-E973 and confirmed in vivo HSP90 binding specificity.

At this locus is a cluster of genes for six miRs (miR-1204, -1205, -1206, -1207-3p, -1207-5p, and -1208), but their functional role remains elusive.

Heavy chains have also been shown to be biomarkers in plasma cell disorders. An unanswered question is whether these Ig biomarkers are heritable, i.e., influenced by germline factors. CLL is heritable but highly heterogeneous. Heritable biomarkers could elucidate steps of disease pathogenesis that are affected by germline factors, and may help partition heterogeneity and identify genetic pleiotropies across malignancies. Relatives in CLL pedigrees present an opportunity to identify heritable biomarkers. We compared FLCs and heavy chains between relatives in 23 high-risk CLL pedigrees and population controls. Elevated IgM (eIgM) and abnormal FLC (aFLC) ratio was significantly increased in relatives, suggesting that these Ig biomarkers are heritable and could offer risk stratification in pedigree relatives. Within high-risk CLL pedigrees, B-cell lymphoid malignancies were five times more prevalent in close relatives of individuals with eIgM, prostate cancer was three times more prevalent in relatives of individuals with aFLC, and monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis increased surrounding individuals with normal Ig levels. These different clustering patterns suggest Ig biomarkers have the potential to partition genetic heterogeneity in CLL and provide insight into distinct heritable pleiotropies associated with CLL.""","""['Martha J Glenn', 'Michael J Madsen', 'Ethan Davis', 'Cassandra D Garner', 'Karen Curtin', 'Brandt Jones', 'Justin A Williams', 'Michael H Tomasson', 'Nicola J Camp']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Blood Cancer J""","""['Association of elevated serumfree light chains with chronic lymphocytic leukemia and monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis.', 'Host virus and pneumococcus-specific immune responses in high-count monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis and chronic lymphocytic leukemia: implications for disease progression.', 'Evidence of serum immunoglobulin abnormalities up to 9.8 years before diagnosis of chronic lymphocytic leukemia: a prospective study.', 'Monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis: physiological entity or preliminary stage of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia?.', 'What does it mean I have a monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis?: Recent insights and new challenges.', 'Antibodies as biomarkers for cancer risk: a systematic review.', 'Shared genomic segment analysis in a large high-risk chronic lymphocytic leukemia pedigree implicates CXCR4 in inherited risk.', 'Chronic lymphocytic leukemia-like monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis exhibits an increased inflammatory signature that is reduced in early-stage chronic lymphocytic leukemia.']"""

Therefore, the United States Preventive Services Task Force recommends that decisions regarding PSA-based screening of prostate cancer should be made with caution in men ages 55-69 years, and that men ≥70 years should not undergo PSA screening. Here, we investigated the potential of serum miRNAs as an accurate diagnostic method in patients with suspected prostate cancer.  Experimental design:   Serum samples of 809 patients with prostate cancer, 241 negative prostate biopsies, and 500 patients with other cancer types were obtained from the National Cancer Center, Japan. Forty-one healthy control samples were obtained from two other hospitals in Japan. Comprehensive microarray analysis was performed for all samples. Samples were divided into three sets. Candidate miRNAs for prostate cancer detection were identified in the discovery set (n = 123). A diagnostic model was constructed using combinations of candidate miRNAs in the training set (n = 484). The performance of the diagnostic model was evaluated in the validation set (n = 484).  Results:   In the discovery set, 18 candidate miRNAs were identified. A robust diagnostic model was constructed using the combination of two miRNAs (miR-17-3p and miR-1185-2-3p) in the training set. High diagnostic performance with a sensitivity of 90% and a specificity of 90% was achieved in the validation set regardless of the Gleason score and clinical tumor-node-metastasis stage.

In contrast, our current understanding of lipid supply from uptake of exogenous lipids and its regulation by AR is limited, and exogenous lipids may play a much more significant role in prostate cancer and disease progression than previously thought. By applying advanced automated quantitative fluorescence microscopy, we provide the most comprehensive functional analysis of lipid uptake in cancer cells to date and demonstrate that treatment of AR-positive prostate cancer cell lines with androgens results in significantly increased cellular uptake of fatty acids, cholesterol, and low-density lipoprotein particles. Consistent with a direct, regulatory role of AR in this process, androgen-enhanced lipid uptake can be blocked by the AR-antagonist enzalutamide, but is independent of proliferation and cell-cycle progression. This work for the first time comprehensively delineates the lipid transporter landscape in prostate cancer cell lines and patient samples by analysis of transcriptomics and proteomics data, including the plasma membrane proteome. We show that androgen exposure or deprivation regulates the expression of multiple lipid transporters in prostate cancer cell lines and tumor xenografts and that mRNA and protein expression of lipid transporters is enhanced in bone metastatic disease when compared with primary, localized prostate cancer. Our findings provide a strong rationale to investigate lipid uptake as a therapeutic cotarget in the fight against advanced prostate cancer in combination with inhibitors of lipogenesis to delay disease progression and metastasis. IMPLICATIONS: Prostate cancer exhibits metabolic plasticity in acquiring lipids from uptake and lipogenesis at different disease stages, indicating potential therapeutic benefit by cotargeting lipid supply.""","""['Kaylyn D Tousignant', 'Anja Rockstroh', 'Atefeh Taherian Fard', 'Melanie L Lehman', 'Chenwei Wang', 'Stephen J McPherson', 'Lisa K Philp', 'Nenad Bartonicek', 'Marcel E Dinger', 'Colleen C Nelson', 'Martin C Sadowski']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Mol Cancer Res""","""['Upregulation of Scavenger Receptor B1 Is Required for Steroidogenic and Nonsteroidogenic Cholesterol Metabolism in Prostate Cancer.', 'Novel Strategy of Proxalutamide for the Treatment of Prostate Cancer through Coordinated Blockade of Lipogenesis and Androgen Receptor Axis.', 'Endothelin-1 production by prostate cancer cell lines is up-regulated by factors involved in cancer progression and down-regulated by androgens.', 'Androgen action in the prostate gland.', 'Androgens, lipogenesis and prostate cancer.', 'Role of Metabolism and Metabolic Pathways in Prostate Cancer.', 'Targeting lipid metabolism in metastatic prostate cancer.', 'NRF2: A crucial regulator for mitochondrial metabolic shift and prostate cancer progression.', ""Role of Lipids and Lipid Metabolism in Prostate Cancer Progression and the Tumor's Immune Environment."", 'Dual contribution of the mTOR pathway and of the metabolism of amino acids in prostate cancer.']"""

Using in vitro, in vivo, and animal models, we find a direct correlation between miR-644a downregulation and dysregulation of essential cellular processes. MiR-644a downregulated expression of diverse tumor microenvironment drivers including c-Myc, AR coregulators, and antiapoptosis factors Bcl-xl and Bcl2. Moreover, miR-644a modulates epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) by directly targeting EMT-promoting factors ZEB1, cdk6, and Snail. Finally, miR-644a expression suppresses the Warburg effect by direct targeting of c-Myc, Akt, IGF1R, and GAPDH expression. RNA sequencing analysis revealed an analogous downregulation of these factors in animal tumor xenografts. These data demonstrate miR-644a mediated fine-tuning of oncogenesis, stimulating pathways and resultant potentiation of enzalutamide therapy in CRPC patients. SIGNIFICANCE: This study demonstrates that miR-644a therapeutically influences the CRPC tumor microenvironment by suppressing androgen signaling and additional genes involved in metabolism, proliferation, Warburg effect, and EMT, to potentiate the enzalutamide therapy.Graphical Abstract: http://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/canres/79/8/1844/F1.large.jpg.""","""['Jey S Ebron', 'Eswar Shankar', 'Jagjit Singh', 'Kavleen Sikand', 'Crystal M Weyman', 'Sanjay Gupta', 'Daniel J Lindner', 'Xiaoqi Liu', 'Moray J Campbell', 'Girish C Shukla']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Cancer Res""","""['Loss of a Negative Feedback Loop between IRF8 and AR Promotes Prostate Cancer Growth and Enzalutamide Resistance.', 'Orphan nuclear receptor TLX contributes to androgen insensitivity in castration-resistant prostate cancer via its repression of androgen receptor transcription.', 'miR-450a Acts as a Tumor Suppressor in Ovarian Cancer by Regulating Energy Metabolism.', 'The concept and mechanisms of castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Non-Coding RNAs in Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer: Regulation of Androgen Receptor Signaling and Cancer Metabolism.', 'Role of microRNAs in glycolysis in gynecological tumors (Review).', 'Molecular Mechanisms of Noncoding RNA in the Occurrence of Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'LncRNA BCAR4 promotes migration, invasion, and chemo-resistance by inhibiting miR-644a in breast cancer.', 'Systematic Investigation of the Diagnostic and Prognostic Impact of LINC01087 in Human Cancers.', 'A combined signature of glycolysis and immune landscape predicts prognosis and therapeutic response in prostate cancer.']"""
