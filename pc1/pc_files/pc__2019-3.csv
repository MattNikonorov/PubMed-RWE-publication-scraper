In this study, we used whole-body magnetic resonance imaging (WB-MRI) to assess the anatomical distribution of oligo- and polymetastatic disease and the impact of the initial treatment on this distribution in patients.  Materials and methods:   WB-MRI examinations of patients with a rising prostate-specific antigen (PSA) after radical treatment by surgery or/and radiotherapy were analyzed for disease recurrence. The patients were separated into three groups, based on the primary treatment: patients treated by radical prostatectomy without radiotherapy and with/without lymph node dissection (RP), patients treated only by radiotherapy or hormono-radiotherapy (RT) and patients treated with radical prostatectomy and adjuvant or salvage radiotherapy (RP + RT). Patients with ≤ 5 bone or/and node metastases were considered oligometastatic. Regional distributions of bone and lymph nodes metastases were reported using anatomical diagrams. Univariate and multivariable logistic regressions were performed to identify prognostic factors of relapse.  Results:   The primary treatment (RP, RT, RP + RT), Gleason score, PSA at relapse, time between first diagnosis and recurrence did not influence the metastatic status (oligo vs. polymetastatic). Oligometastatic patients showed different distribution of bone metastases compared to the polymetastatic ones and the distribution of the oligometastatic disease was not influenced by the primary treatment.  Conclusions:   In this WB-MRI-based study, there was no evidence that the primary treatment influenced the metastatic status of the patient or the distribution of the oligometastatic disease.""","""['Vassiliki Pasoglou', 'Nicolas Michoux', 'Julien Van Damme', 'Sandy Van Nieuwenhove', 'Marin Halut', 'Perrine Triqueneaux', 'Bertrand Tombal', 'Frédéric E Lecouvet']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""World J Urol""","""['Whole body MRI (WB-MRI) assessment of metastatic spread in prostate cancer: Therapeutic perspectives on targeted management of oligometastatic disease.', 'Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging Is an Independent Predictor of Salvage Radiotherapy Outcomes After Radical Prostatectomy.', 'Combined Whole Body and Multiparametric Prostate Magnetic Resonance Imaging as a 1-Step Approach to the Simultaneous Assessment of Local Recurrence and Metastatic Disease after Radical Prostatectomy.', 'Metastasis-directed therapy of regional and distant recurrences after curative treatment of prostate cancer: a systematic review of the literature.', 'Management of Biochemical Recurrence after Primary Curative Treatment for Prostate Cancer: A Review.', 'Simple immobilization for stereotactic radiotherapy aimed at pelvic metastases.', 'PSMA PET-CT in the Diagnosis and Staging of Prostate Cancer.', 'Whole-Body MRI vs. PET/CT for the Detection of Bone Metastases in Patients With Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.', 'Developments in oligometastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer.']"""

We sought to characterize those patients receiving AUS after cTURP and understand device longevity.  Materials and methods:   We identified patients who underwent cTURP and AUS placement in SEER-Medicare from 2002 to 2014. We analyzed factors affecting device longevity using multivariable Cox proportional hazard models. We performed propensity matching to accurately compare patients receiving AUS after cTURP to those receiving AUS after radical prostatectomy (RP).  Results:   For patients undergoing cTURP, 201 out of 56,957 ultimately underwent AUS placement (< 0.5%). AUS after cTURP incurred a 48.4% rate of reoperation versus 30.9% after RP. Importantly, patients undergoing cTURP were significantly older than those undergoing RP [75 vs. 71 years of age (p < 0.01)]. At 3 years after insertion, 28.2% of patients after RP required reoperation compared to 37.8% of patients post-cTURP (p < 0.01). There were no detectable differences in revision rates for those patients who underwent traditional vs. laser cTURP. Patients with a history of radiation therapy had significantly shorter device survival. Even after propensity matching, patients receiving AUS after cTURP incurred more short-term complications compared to AUS after RP. Differences in device longevity were diminished after propensity match.  Conclusions:   In the SEER-Medicare population, AUS after cTURP remains rare. While there is an increased risk of infectious complications, AUS after cTURP fared similarly to AUS after RP in terms of device longevity. A history of radiation therapy leads to worse outcome for all patients.""","""['Andrew J Cohen', 'William Boysen', 'Kristine Kuchta', 'Sarah Faris', 'Jaclyn Milose']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""World J Urol""","""['Patterns and timing of artificial urinary sphincter failure.', 'Artificial urinary sphincter for urinary incontinence after radical prostatectomy: a historical cohort from 2004 to 2015.', 'Do clinical or urodynamic parameters predict artificial urinary sphincter outcome in post-radical prostatectomy incontinence?', 'Surgery for stress urinary incontinence due to presumed sphincter deficiency after prostate surgery.', 'Two-stage management of severe postprostatectomy bladder neck contracture associated with stress incontinence.', 'Presenting signs and symptoms of artificial urinary sphincter cuff erosion.', 'Artificial Urinary Sphincter Complications: Risk Factors, Workup, and Clinical Approach.']"""

Increasing physical activity, improving diet, supporting psychological well-being and weight loss can improve quality of life in several cancers and may limit relapse. The aim of the randomised controlled trial outlined in this protocol is to examine whether a digital intervention (Renewed), with or without human support, can improve quality of life in cancer survivors. Renewed provides support for increasing physical activity, managing difficult emotions, eating a healthier diet and weight management.  Methods and analysis:   A randomised controlled trial is being conducted comparing usual care, access to Renewed or access to Renewed with brief human support. Cancer survivors who have had colorectal, breast or prostate cancer will be identified and invited through general practice searches and mail-outs. Participants are asked to complete baseline measures immediately after screening and will then be randomised to a study group; this is all completed on the Renewed website. The primary outcome is quality of life measured by the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer QLQ-c30. Secondary outcomes include anxiety and depression, fear of cancer recurrence, general well-being, enablement and items relating to costs for a health economics analysis. Process measures include perceptions of human support, intervention usage and satisfaction, and adherence to behavioural changes. Qualitative process evaluations will be conducted with patients and healthcare staff providing support.  Ethics and dissemination:   The trial has been approved by the NHS Research Ethics Committee (Reference 18/NW/0013). The results of this trial will be published in peer-reviewed journals and through conference presentations.

This could be improved if directly conducted in suspicious cancer spots, preventing the need for biopsy. Lung cancer remains a perfect study-case for such a development, as it is generally detected at advanced stage and is in the need for early diagnosis techniques. To this aim, we have designed a minimally invasive catheter-embedded biosensor. It combines a specific grating structure photo-imprinted in a telecommunication-grade optical fiber and an overlay made of a thin metal coating on which receptors are grafted, yielding plasmonic coupling. Our optrode targets a type of cytokeratins, overexpressed at the surface of cancer cells. It was assayed ex vivo in resected lung tissues collected from a dozen of patients. Biosensing responses were confirmed by immunohistochemistry, conducted on the same samples. In addition to accurate biosensing, our gratings inherently enable force-sensing features, which also allow a fine positioning of the probe in the tissue. Finally, the in vivo navigation of the bronchoscope-embedded sensor was validated into pig lungs. These achievements are a critical milestone towards the development of this micro/nano biosensor as a cost-effective and weakly invasive diagnostic tool for applications in areas of critical access such as brain, liver or prostate.""","""['Médéric Loyez', 'Jean-Charles Larrieu', 'Samia Chevineau', 'Myriam Remmelink', 'Dimitri Leduc', 'Benjamin Bondue', 'Pierre Lambert', 'Jacques Devière', 'Ruddy Wattiez', 'Christophe Caucheteur']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Biosens Bioelectron""","""['Cancer biomarker sensing using packaged plasmonic optical fiber gratings: Towards in vivo diagnosis.', 'Immunosensing with Near-Infrared Plasmonic Optical Fiber Gratings.', 'Cytokeratins Biosensing Using Tilted Fiber Gratings.', 'Fiber Optic Surface Plasmon Resonance-Based Biosensor Technique: Fabrication, Advancement, and Application.', 'Plasmonic Optical Fiber-Grating Immunosensing: A Review.', 'Ultralow Limit Detection of Soluble HER2 Biomarker in Serum with a Fiber-Optic Ball-Tip Resonator Assisted by a Tilted FBG.', 'Spatial-Division Multiplexing Approach for Simultaneous Detection of Fiber-Optic Ball Resonator Sensors: Applications for Refractometers and Biosensors.', 'Cost-Effective Fiber Optic Solutions for Biosensing.', 'Fiber-Optic Distributed Sensing Network for Thermal Mapping of Gold Nanoparticles-Mediated Radiofrequency Ablation.', 'Cladding Mode Fitting-Assisted Automatic Refractive Index Demodulation Optical Fiber Sensor Probe Based on Tilted Fiber Bragg Grating and SPR.']"""

Ga-68 prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) and nano magnetic resonance imaging (nano-MRI) might be noninvasive alternatives for ePLND; however, it remains uncertain whether they are cost-effective.  Objective:   To develop an interactive model to determine the cost-effectiveness of 68Ga PSMA PET/CT and nano-MRI as compared with ePLND for the detection of pelvic LN metastases in patients with intermediate- to high-risk PCa.  Design, setting, and participants:   Decision tree with state transition model for men with intermediate- to high-risk PCa. Input data was derived from systematic literature searches.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and healthcare costs were modelled over lifetime. Sensitivity analyses were used to assess uncertainty.  Results and limitations:   Assuming 100% sensitivity of ePLND, no QALY loss after ePLND, and no treatment improvement due to imaging, the PSMA PET/CT and nano-MRI strategies seem to be less expensive per patient (€3047 and €2738, respectively) and result in loss of QALYs (0.07 and 0.03, respectively) compared with the ePLND strategy. PSMA PET/CT and nano-MRI are both cost saving and more effective when ePLND has a sensitivity of ≤60% and ≤84%, ePLND results in a QALY loss of 0.060 and 0.024 over lifetime, or the imaging techniques reduce recurrences by 26% and 8%, respectively.  Conclusions:   PSMA PET/CT and nano-MRI seem to be cost-effective compared with ePLND since they save cost, but at the possible expense of a small QALY loss. Our interactive model provides insight into the influence of important model parameters on the cost effectiveness of 68Ga PSMA PET/CT and nano-MRI, and the opportunity for updating the cost effectiveness when new evidence becomes available.  Patient summary:   We developed an interactive model that can be used in shared decision making regarding the use of extended pelvic lymph node dissection, 68Ga prostate-specific membrane antigen positron emission tomography/computed tomography, or nano magnetic resonance imaging for lymph node staging in individual patients with intermediate- to high-risk prostate cancer. Owing to remaining uncertainty, we cannot yet give advice about the use of these techniques.""","""['Mirre Scholte', 'Jelle O Barentsz', 'J P Michiel Sedelaar', 'Martin Gotthardt', 'Janneke P C Grutters', 'Maroeska M Rovers']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Eur Urol Focus""","""['Distribution of prostate cancer recurrences on gallium-68 prostate-specific membrane antigen (68 Ga-PSMA) positron-emission/computed tomography after radical prostatectomy with pathological node-positive extended lymph node dissection.', 'Histological comparison between predictive value of preoperative 3-T multiparametric MRI and 68 Ga-PSMA PET/CT scan for pathological outcomes at radical prostatectomy and pelvic lymph node dissection for prostate cancer.', 'More advantages in detecting bone and soft tissue metastases from prostate cancer using 18F-PSMA PET/CT.', 'Can Negative Prostate-specific Membrane Antigen Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography Avoid the Need for Pelvic Lymph Node Dissection in Newly Diagnosed Prostate Cancer Patients?

Methods:   The log-rank test was used to assess the statistical differences between survival curves according to age at diagnosis, risk of disease progression including Gleason score, stage at diagnosis and Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA). A multivariable Cox model was constructed to identify independent prognostic factors for OS.  Results:   A total of 5045 patients were included with a mean age at diagnosis of 68.1±9.0 years [36.0 - 98.0 years].

We hypothesized that regional cancer mortality rates in Taiwan, an ethnically homogeneous society, exhibited no significant variations.  Methods:   We investigated the trends in Taiwan regional cancer mortality between 1992 and 2014. We analyzed regional age-standardized cancer mortality rates for lung, liver, colon, stomach, oral, breast, and prostate cancers using the Taiwan Longitudinal Health Insurance Database and Demographic Database. Furthermore, we applied Joinpoint regression analysis to evaluate the trends across different regions.  Results:   There are clear regional variations in mortality rates for liver, stomach, and oral cancers, but not for lung, colon, breast, and prostate cancers. The regional death rates of oral cancer, especially for eastern Taiwan, not only elevate the fastest (APC = 14.78% per year, P < 0.001) but also show the largest disparities between men and women. Regional death rates for stomach cancer, which declined most rapidly, are converging in both general and gender groups. Liver cancer is the only one with regional variations whose trends do not all go in the same direction. We also demonstrated that northern Taiwan has significant regional advantages with respect to cancer mortality.  Conclusions:   Some but not all cancers in Taiwan show regional disparities.

Reirradiation consisted of a stereotactic treatment delivered by image guided radiation therapy-volumetric modulated arc therapy with flattening filter-free technology in 5 daily fractions.  Results:   Twenty-three patients underwent reirradiation to the prostate, prostatic bed, or prostate and local recurrence. Re-treatment consisted of a median total dose of 25 Gy in 5 fractions. A biochemical response was observed in all cases. Acute toxicity was mainly genitourinary (GU) grade 1 to 2 (n = 13; 56.5%). One patient (4.3%) had grade 3 hematuria. A grade 1 GU late toxicity was registered in 4 patients (17.4%) and grade 3 in 1 patient (4.3%, urethral obstruction). Gastrointestinal toxicity was negligible. Regression analysis showed that only a short elapsed time in months from primary radiation therapy was significantly correlated with acute GU toxicity. After a median follow-up of 33 months (range, 5-58 months), the median biochemical recurrence-free survival was 19 months, and the 2-year biochemical recurrence-free survival (BRFS) was 41.7%. Median local control was 30 months; the 2-year local control rate was 58.1%.  Conclusions:   Reirradiation of patients with prostate cancer who underwent previous radiation therapy is a valuable option that can be safely considered to delay the beginning of hormonal treatment.""","""[""Giuseppe Roberto D'Agostino"", 'Lucia Di Brina', 'Pietro Mancosu', 'Ciro Franzese', 'Cristina Iftode', 'Davide Franceschini', 'Elena Clerici', 'Angelo Tozzi', 'Pierina Navarria', 'Marta Scorsetti']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys""","""['Interim Results of a Prospective Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen-Directed Focal Stereotactic Reirradiation Trial for Locally Recurrent Prostate Cancer.', 'Hyaluronic acid spacer in focal prostate reirradiation: A single centre experience.', 'Reirradiation for isolated local recurrence of prostate cancer: Mono-institutional series of 64 patients treated with salvage stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT).', 'Salvage reirradiation for local prostate cancer recurrence after radiation therapy.

Patients and methods:   Data from 159 men with Gleason Grade Group (GGG) 3 or 4 were considered. All patients had Decipher diagnostic testing with transcript profiles and single-channel array normalisation (SCAN)-normalised expression of coding genes. The relationship between Decipher and TP5 was investigated by linear and binary logistic regressions. A differential transcriptomic analysis between patients with and without TP5 was performed. The prognostic role of these genes on progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) was evaluated using The Cancer Genome Atlas.  Results:   In all, 52/159 (33%) patients had GGG 3-4 with TP5 disease. TP5 was associated with a higher Decipher score (β 0.07, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.02-0.13; P = 0.04) and higher likelihood of falling within the intermediate- or high-risk categories (odds ratio 3.34, 95% CI 1.34-8.35; P = 0.01). Analysis of microarray data revealed an 18-gene signature that was differentially expressed in patients with TP5; 13 genes were over- and five under-expressed in the TP5 cohort. The overexpression of cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor 2B (CDKN2B), polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1), or cell division cycle 20 (CDC20) was associated with worse PFS. The group harbouring overexpression of at least one gene had a 5-year PFS rate of 50% vs 74% in the group without overexpression (P < 0.001).  Conclusions:   Our studies have elucidated unique genomic features of TP5, whilst confirming previous clinical findings that patients harbouring TP5 tend to have worse prognosis.

The aim of this study is to determine pathological variables that can predict differences in response to NHT in PCa.  Methods:   A total of 85 locally high risk PCa patients with matched preoperative needle biopsies and radical prostatectomy (RP) specimens were included. All patients were treated with NHT for at least 3 months. We quantified the response to NHT using a new proposed pathological grading system. The system classified tumors into five groups (grades 0-4) according to the severity of histological response. We then categorized the PCa patients into drug-sensitive (DS) group (Grades 2-4) and drug-resistant (DR) group (Grades 0-1). Two pathologists assessed each pretreated tumors for presence or absence of nine morphological features. The expression of androgen receptor (AR), ERG, and PTEN were evaluated by immunohistochemistry (IHC) as well. Statistical analysis was performed to identify significant associations between differentially histological response to NHT and morphological features as well as molecular aberrations. We evaluated different prediction models using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and area under the ROC curve (AUC) analysis.  Results:   73% (n = 62/85) of tumors in our cohort belonged to DS group, whereas 27% (n = 23/85) of tumors were DR. Univariate logistic analysis suggested four pathological variables, cribriform growth pattern, macronucleoli, ductal adenocarcinoma differentiation, and PTEN loss in needle biopsies were significantly associated with DR effect, all with P-value < 0.05. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that the three parameters as significant predictive factors for predicting DR effect. These were macronucleoli (RR = 4.008, P = 0.002), ductal adenocarcinoma differentiation (RR = 11.659, P = 0.009) and PTEN loss expression (RR = 7.275, P = 0.015). The AUC of three integrated indicators model was 0.781.  Conclusions:   Our study suggested that the presence of tumor cribriform growth pattern, macronucleoli, ductal adenocarcinoma differentiation, and PTEN loss in needle biopsies are of value in predicting tumor response to NHT regimen. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed the performance of combined pathological indicators in predicting DR response was better than that of model based on individual factor alone.""","""['Xueli Wang', 'Mei Qi', 'Jing Zhang', 'Xiubin Sun', 'Hongwei Guo', 'Yu Pang', 'Qian Zhang', 'Xinyi Chen', 'Ruifeng Zhang', 'Zhiyan Liu', 'Long Liu', 'Xiaomeng Hao', 'Bo Han']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Effect of total androgen ablation on pathologic stage and resection limit status of prostate cancer.

Given that evidence remains limited, we evaluated whether intakes of choline and derivative betaine are associated with total and lethal PCa risk and PCa death in men with PCa.  Methods:   We included 6,528 men (24.4% African American) without a cancer diagnosis at baseline (1987-1989) followed through 2012. Dietary intake was assessed using a food frequency questionnaire coupled with a nutrient database. We used Cox proportional hazards regression to estimate hazards ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of total and lethal PCa risk overall and by race.  Results:   Choline intake was not associated with total (n = 811) or lethal (n = 95) PCa risk overall or by race. Betaine intake was inversely associated with lethal (tertile 3 vs 1, HR 0.59, 95% CI 0.35-1.00, p trend = 0.04), but not total PCa risk; patterns for lethal PCa were similar by race. Neither nutrient was associated with PCa death in men with PCa.  Conclusions:   Choline intake was not associated with total or lethal PCa or with PCa death in men with PCa. Betaine intake was inversely associated with lethal, but not total PCa risk or with PCa death in men with PCa. Our results do not support the hypothesis that higher choline intake increases lethal PCa risk, but do suggest that higher betaine intake may be associated with lower lethal PCa risk.

Inclusion criteria were: histologically proven PCa, BCR after primary treatment with curative intent, oligometastatic disease defined as ≤ 3 metastatic lesions. To evaluate the efficacy of the therapy, biochemical response defined as a decrease of > 50% of PSA (PSA50) was measured at 1 and 4 months. Patients were followed up until progression and start of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). BCR-free survival and ADT-free survival were calculated.  Results:   20 patients met the inclusion criteria. Median PSA value: 1.4 ng/ml (IQR, 0.3-2.3 ng/ml).

RR was used for the first half of the treatment sessions. Two plans were created for each patient to compare the effect of RR on rectal doses. PTW-31014 Pinpoint chamber embedded within RR was used for in vivo dosimetry in 6 of 21 patients. The patient tolerance and acute rectal toxicity were surveyed during radiotherapy using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v.4.0.  Results:   Patients tolerated the RR well during 20 fractions with mild degree of anal irritation. Using a RR significantly reduced the rectal wall (RW), anterior RW and posterior RW dose-volume parameters. The average RW Dmean was 29.4 and 43.0 Gy for plans with and without RR, respectively. The mean discrepancy between the measured dose and planned dose was -3.8% (±4.9%). Grade 1 diarrhea, rectal urgency and proctitis occurred in 4, 2 and 3 cases, respectively.

The present study demonstrated that oral administration of 1.0×109 colony-forming units of B. longum 420 induced significantly higher cytotoxicity against TRAMP-C2 cells than intraperitoneal injection of 100 μg of Db126, and the in vivo antitumor activity of B. longum 420 in the TRAMP-C2 tumor model could be augmented by intraperitoneal injections of 250 μg of anti-PD-1 antibody. For the clinical development, we produced the B440 pharmaceutical formulation, which is lyophilized powder of inactivated B. longum 440 displaying the partially modified human WT1 protein. We confirmed that B. longum 440 could induce cellular immunity specific to multiple WT1 epitopes. In a preclinical dosage study, B440 significantly inhibited growth of the TRAMP-C2 tumors compared with that of the control groups (PBS and B. longum not expressing WT1) at all dosages (1, 5, and 10 mg/body of B440). These mouse doses were considered to correspond with practical oral administration doses of 0.2, 1, and 2 g/body for humans.

However, the mechanism(s) by which SULT2B1b alters these properties within prostate cancer cells has not been described. Furthermore, specific advantages of SULT2B1b expression in prostate cancer cells are not understood. In these studies, single-cell mRNA sequencing was conducted to compare the transcriptomes of SULT2B1b knockdown (KD) versus Control KD LNCaP cells. Over 2,000 differentially expressed genes were identified along with alterations in numerous canonical pathways, including the death receptor signaling pathway. The studies herein demonstrate that SULT2B1b KD increases TNFα expression in prostate cancer cells and results in NF-κB activation in a TNF-dependent manner. More importantly, SULT2B1b KD significantly enhances TNF-mediated apoptosis in both TNF-sensitive LNCaP cells and TNF-resistant C4-2 cells. Overexpression of SULT2B1b in LNCaP cells also decreases sensitivity to TNF-mediated cell death, suggesting that SULT2B1b modulates pathways dictating the TNF sensitivity capacity of prostate cancer cells. Probing human prostate cancer patient datasets further supports this work by providing evidence that SULT2B1b expression is inversely correlated with TNF-related genes, including TNF, CD40LG, FADD, and NFKB1. Together, these data provide evidence that SULT2B1b expression in prostate cancer cells enhances resistance to TNF and may provide a growth advantage. In addition, targeting SULT2B1b may induce an enhanced therapeutic response to TNF treatment in advanced prostate cancer.

Objective:   To determine whether PSA screening decreases PCa mortality for up to 16yr and to assess results following adjustment for nonparticipation and the number of screening rounds attended.  Design, setting, and participants:   This multicentre population-based randomised screening trial was conducted in eight European countries. Report includes 182160 men, followed up until 2014 (maximum of 16yr), with a predefined core age group of 162389 men (55-69yr), selected from population registry.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   The outcome was PCa mortality, also assessed with adjustment for nonparticipation and the number of screening rounds attended.  Results and limitations:   The rate ratio of PCa mortality was 0.80 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.72-0.89, p<0.001) at 16yr. The difference in absolute PCa mortality increased from 0.14% at 13yr to 0.18% at 16yr. The number of men needed to be invited for screening to prevent one PCa death was 570 at 16yr compared with 742 at 13yr. The number needed to diagnose was reduced to 18 from 26 at 13yr. Men with PCa detected during the first round had a higher prevalence of PSA >20ng/ml (9.9% compared with 4.1% in the second round, p<0.001) and higher PCa mortality (hazard ratio=1.86, p<0.001) than those detected subsequently.  Conclusions:   Findings corroborate earlier results that PSA screening significantly reduces PCa mortality, showing larger absolute benefit with longer follow-up and a reduction in excess incidence. Repeated screening may be important to reduce PCa mortality on a population level.  Patient summary:   In this report, we looked at the outcomes from prostate cancer in a large European population. We found that repeated screening reduces the risk of dying from prostate cancer.""","""['Jonas Hugosson', 'Monique J Roobol', 'Marianne Månsson', 'Teuvo L J Tammela', 'Marco Zappa', 'Vera Nelen', 'Maciej Kwiatkowski', 'Marcos Lujan', 'Sigrid V Carlsson', 'Kirsi M Talala', 'Hans Lilja', 'Louis J Denis', 'Franz Recker', 'Alvaro Paez', 'Donella Puliti', 'Arnauld Villers', 'Xavier Rebillard', 'Tuomas P Kilpeläinen', 'Ulf H Stenman', 'Rebecka Arnsrud Godtman', 'Karin Stinesen Kollberg', 'Sue M Moss', 'Paula Kujala', 'Kimmo Taari', 'Andreas Huber', 'Theodorus van der Kwast', 'Eveline A Heijnsdijk', 'Chris Bangma', 'Harry J De Koning', 'Fritz H Schröder', 'Anssi Auvinen;ERSPC investigators']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Eur Urol""","""['Solid Science for the Upside but Lack of Solid Science for the Downside-Towards Cutting-edge Prostate-cancer Screening.', 'Re: Jonas Hugosson, Monique J.

Methods:   In this study, MAPT expression was analyzed by immunohistochemistry on a tissue microarray containing 17,747 prostate cancers.  Results:   MAPT was absent in normal prostate epithelial cells but detectable in 1004 (8.2%) of 12,313 interpretable cancers. Its expression was associated with advanced tumor stage, high Gleason grade, positive lymph nodes, and early biochemical recurrence (p < 0.0001 each). For example, MAPT was found in 3.6% of 2072 Gleason ≤3 + 3 cancers but in 14.4% of 704 Gleason ≥4 + 4 cancers. High-level MAPT staining was also linked to TMPRSS2:ERG fusions (p < 0.0001). MAPT staining was seen in 15.2 and 16% of cancers with TMPRSS2:ERG fusion detected by immunohistochemistry and fluorescence in-situ hybridization, but in only 3.5 and 3.9% of cancers without ERG staining or ERG rearrangements. Moreover, an association was found between MAPT expression and PTEN deletions, with 19% MAPT positivity in 948 PTEN deleted cancers but only 7% MAPT positivity in 3895 tumors with normal PTEN copy numbers (p < 0.0001). Multivariate analysis revealed that the prognostic value of MAPT was independent from established parameters. Conventional large section analyses showed intratumoral MAPT heterogeneity in all three analyzed cancers.

We investigated trends in TTI for common solid tumors treated with curative intent, determinants of increased TTI and association with overall survival.  Methods and findings:   We utilized prospective data from the National Cancer Database for newly diagnosed United States patients with early-stage breast, prostate, lung, colorectal, renal and pancreas cancers from 2004-13. TTI was defined as days from diagnosis to first treatment (surgery, systemic or radiation therapy). Negative binomial regression and Cox proportional hazard models were used for analysis. The study population of 3,672,561 patients included breast (N = 1,368,024), prostate (N = 944,246), colorectal (N = 662,094), non-small cell lung (N = 363,863), renal (N = 262,915) and pancreas (N = 71,419) cancers. Median TTI increased from 21 to 29 days (P<0.001). Aside from year of diagnosis, determinants of increased TTI included care at academic center, race, education, prior history of cancer, transfer of facility, comorbidities and age. Increased TTI was associated with worsened survival for stages I and II breast, lung, renal and pancreas cancers, and stage I colorectal cancers, with hazard ratios ranging from 1.005 (95% confidence intervals [CI] 1.002-1.008) to 1.030 (95% CI 1.025-1.035) per week of increased TTI.  Conclusions:   TTI has lengthened significantly and is associated with absolute increased risk of mortality ranging from 1.2-3.2% per week in curative settings such as early-stage breast, lung, renal and pancreas cancers.

This work characterized geometric and dosimetric intra-fractional changes between the prostate, seminal vesicles (SVs), and organs at risk (OARs) in response to bladder filling conditions.  Materials and methods:   T2-weighted and mDixon sequences (3-4 time points/subject, at 1, 1.5 and 3.0 T with totally 34 evaluable time points) were acquired in nine subjects using a fixed bladder filling protocol (bladder void, 20 oz water consumed pre-imaging, 10 oz mid-session). Using mDixon images, Magnetic Resonance for Calculating Attenuation (MR-CAT) synthetic computed tomography (CT) images were generated by classifying voxels as muscle, adipose, spongy, and compact bone and by assignment of bulk Hounsfield Unit values. Organs including the prostate, SVs, bladder, and rectum were delineated on the T2 images at each time point by one physician. The displacement of the prostate and SVs was assessed based on the shift of the center of mass of the delineated organs from the reference state (fullest bladder). Changes in dose plans at different bladder states were assessed based on volumetric modulated arc radiotherapy (VMAT) plans generated for the reference state.  Results:   Bladder volume reduction of 70 ± 14% from the final to initial time point (relative to the final volume) was observed in the subject population. In the empty bladder condition, the dose delivered to 95% of the planning target volume (PTV) (D95%) reduced significantly for all cases (11.53 ± 6.00%) likely due to anterior shifts of prostate/SVs relative to full bladder conditions. D15% to the bladder increased consistently in all subjects (42.27 ± 40.52%). Changes in D15% to the rectum were patient-specific, ranging from -23.93% to 22.28% (-0.76 ± 15.30%).  Conclusions:   Variations in the bladder and rectal volume can significantly dislocate the prostate and OARs, which can negatively impact the dose delivered to these organs. This warrants proper preparation of patients during treatment and imaging sessions, especially when imaging required longer scan times such as MR protocols.""","""['Siamak P Nejad-Davarani', 'Parag Sevak', 'Michael Moncion', 'Kimberly Garbarino', 'Steffen Weiss', 'Joshua Kim', 'Lonni Schultz', 'Mohamed A Elshaikh', 'Steffen Renisch', 'Carri Glide-Hurst']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""J Appl Clin Med Phys""","""['Retrospective study comparing MR-guided radiation therapy (MRgRT) setup strategies for prostate treatment: repositioning vs. replanning.', 'Treatment planning comparison of IMPT, VMAT and 4π radiotherapy for prostate cases.', 'MRI-based IMRT planning for MR-linac: comparison between CT- and MRI-based plans for pancreatic and prostate cancers.', 'Modern Radiation Therapy Planning and Delivery.', 'Imaging for Target Delineation and Treatment Planning in Radiation Oncology: Current and Emerging Techniques.', 'Clinical Practice Evolvement for Post-Operative Prostate Cancer Radiotherapy-Part 1: Consistent Organs at Risk Management with Advanced Image Guidance.', 'Assessment of intrafractional prostate motion and its dosimetric impact in MRI-guided online adaptive radiotherapy with gating.', 'Bowel and Bladder Reproducibility in Image Guided Radiation Therapy for Prostate Cancer: Results of a Patterns of Practice Survey.', 'Automatic localization of the prostatic urethra for image guided radiation therapy.', 'Maintaining consistent bladder filling during external beam radiotherapy for prostate cancer.']"""

Results: A total of 267 cancers occurred in 143 patients (SIR 6.0; 95% confidence interval (CI) 5.3-6.7). The SIR for overall cancer was considerably higher for men (SIR 6.7; 95% CI 5.9-7.5) than for women (1.4; 95% CI 0.6-2.6). Most frequent cancers were non-melanoma skin cancers (basal cell carcinoma 83 cases, squamous cell skin cancer (SCC) 56 cases), followed by Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) (36 cases), lung cancer (17), cancer of prostate (16) and cancer of kidney (12). SIRs were highest for SCC (51.9; 95% CI 39.2-67.4), lip cancer (47.4; 95% CI 19.1-97.7), cancer of tongue (26.3; 95% CI 7.2-67.4), and NHL (25.7; 95% CI 18.0-35.6). For most cancers, SIRs increased steadily by time since transplantation. Cancer mortality was three times higher for heart transplant recipients than for the population (SMR 3.1; 95% CI 2.1-4.1).

Little is known regarding the underlying mechanisms of AZGP1 in prostate cancer (PCa). In the present study, we report that AZGP1 is an androgen-responsive gene, which is involved in AR-induced PCa cell proliferation and metastasis. In clinical specimens, the expression of AZGP1 in PCa tissues is markedly higher than that in adjacent normal tissues. In cultures, expression of AZGP1 is upregulated by the androgen-AR axis at both messenger RNA and protein levels. Furthermore, Chip-Seq assay identifies canonical androgen-responsive elements (AREs) at AZGP1 enhancer; and dual-luciferase reporter assays reveal that the AREs is highly responsive to androgen whereas mutations of the AREs abolish the reporter activity. In addition, AZGP1 promotes G1/S phase transition and cell cycle progress by increasing cyclin D1 levels in PCa cells. Functional studies demonstrate that knocking down endogenous AZGP1 expression in LNCaP and CWR22Rv1 cells largely weaken androgen/AR axis-induced cell migration and invasion. In vivo xenotransplantation tumor experiments also show that AZGP1 involves in androgen/AR axis-mediated PCa cell proliferation.

Depletion of POLR3G selectively triggers proliferative arrest and differentiation of prostate cancer cells, responses not elicited when POLR3GL is depleted. A small molecule pol III inhibitor can cause POLR3G depletion, induce similar differentiation and suppress proliferation and viability of cancer cells. This response involves control of the fate-determining factor NANOG by small RNAs derived from Alu short interspersed nuclear elements.

The levels of AR-FL and AR-V transcripts are often tightly correlated in individual CRPC samples, yet our understanding of how their expression is co-regulated is limited. Here, we report a role of c-Myc in accounting for coordinated AR-FL and AR-V expression. Analysis of gene-expression data from 159 metastatic CRPC samples and 2142 primary prostate tumors showed that the level of c-Myc is positively correlated with that of individual AR isoforms. A striking positive correlation also exists between the activity of the c-Myc pathway and the level of individual AR isoforms, between the level of c-Myc and the activity of the AR pathway, and between the activities of the two pathways. Moreover, the c-Myc signature is highly enriched in tumors expressing high levels of AR, as is the AR signature in c-Myc-high-expressing tumors. Using shRNA knockdown, we confirmed c-Myc regulation of expression and activity of AR-FL and AR-Vs in cell models and a patient-derived xenograft model. Mechanistically, c-Myc promotes the transcription of the AR gene and enhances the stability of the AR-FL and AR-V proteins without altering AR RNA splicing. Importantly, inhibiting c-Myc sensitizes enzalutamide-resistant cells to growth inhibition by enzalutamide. Overall, this study highlights a critical role of c-Myc in regulating the coordinated expression of AR-FL and AR-Vs that is commonly observed in CRPC and suggests the utility of targeting c-Myc as an adjuvant to AR-directed therapy.""","""['Shanshan Bai', 'Subing Cao', 'Lianjin Jin', 'Margaret Kobelski', 'Blake Schouest', 'Xiaojie Wang', 'Nathan Ungerleider', 'Melody Baddoo', 'Wensheng Zhang', 'Eva Corey', 'Robert L Vessella', 'Xuesen Dong', 'Kun Zhang', 'Xianghui Yu', 'Erik K Flemington', 'Yan Dong']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Oncogene""","""['Cotargeting Androgen Receptor Splice Variants and mTOR Signaling Pathway for the Treatment of Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Androgen receptor splice variants activating the full-length receptor in mediating resistance to androgen-directed therapy.', 'Interplay between Cytoplasmic and Nuclear Androgen Receptor Splice Variants Mediates Castration Resistance.', 'Androgen Receptor Rearrangement and Splicing Variants in Resistance to Endocrine Therapies in Prostate Cancer.', 'The link between androgen receptor splice variants and castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'ALAN is a computational approach that interprets genomic findings in the context of tumor ecosystems.', 'Strategies to target the cancer driver MYC in tumor cells.', 'Bone Metastases and Health in Prostate Cancer: From Pathophysiology to Clinical Implications.', 'Quantitative In Vivo Imaging of the Androgen Receptor Axis Reveals Degree of Prostate Cancer Radiotherapy Response.', 'To bind or not to bind: Cistromic reprogramming in prostate cancer.']"""

Using serial single-cell RNA sequencing in an orthotopic mouse prostate cancer model, we find up-regulation of prolactin receptor as cancer cells that have disseminated to the lungs expand into micrometastases. Secretion of the ligand prolactin by adjacent lung stromal cells is induced by tumor cell production of the COX-2 synthetic product prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). PGE2 treatment of fibroblasts activates the orphan nuclear receptor NR4A (Nur77), with prolactin as a major transcriptional target for the NR4A-retinoid X receptor (RXR) heterodimer. Ectopic expression of prolactin receptor in mouse cancer cells enhances micrometastasis, while treatment with the COX-2 inhibitor celecoxib abrogates prolactin secretion by fibroblasts and reduces tumor initiation. Across multiple human cancers, COX-2, prolactin, and prolactin receptor show consistent differential expression in tumor and stromal compartments.

We assessed trends of node-positive prostate cancer in context of extent of lymphadenectomy among men treated surgically for prostate cancer.  Patients and methods:   This was a retrospective study using data from a population-based cancer registry to identify men older than 50 years of age diagnosed with prostate cancer from 2010 to 2015 without distant metastases. We considered extent of node dissection as ordinal (1-4, 5-9, 10-14, 15-19, ≥20) and dichotomous (1-14, ≥15) variables. We fit multivariable models to assess trends in receipt of extended lymphadenectomy and then estimated odds of node-positive cancer on the basis of extent of lymphadenectomy.  Results:   We identified 280,156 men diagnosed from 2010 to 2015; 5355 men (1.9%) had positive lymph nodes. Incidence of positive nodes increased from 6.4 to 8.4 cases per 100,000 men from 2010 to 2015 (standardized rate ratio, 1.31; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.20-1.44). Compared with 2010, prostatectomy patients with high-risk (odds ratio [OR], 1.66; 95% CI, 1.42-1.95) and intermediate-risk tumors (OR, 1.66; 95% CI, 1.47-1.88) were more likely to undergo extended lymphadenectomy in 2015. Among high-risk patients, men with ≥20 nodes removed were 7 times more likely to have positive nodes, versus <5 removed (6.1% for 1-4 vs. 32.4% for ≥20; OR, 7.32; 95% CI, 6.16-8.71). After adjusting for extent of dissection, odds of node-positive disease did not increase between 2010 and 2015 (OR, 1.17; 95% CI, 0.98-1.39) among high-risk patients.

Ectopic expression of mature micro-ribonucleic acids or small-interfering ribonucleic acids were applied to functional assays for cancer cell lines. Genome-wide gene expression and in silico database analyses were carried out to predict micro-ribonucleic acid targets.  Results:   Ectopic expression of miR-199a/b inhibited cancer cell aggressiveness. The gene coding for non-structural maintenance of chromosomes condensin I complex subunit H was directly regulated by miR-199a/b-3p. High expression of condensin I complex subunit H was significantly associated with poor disease-free survival by The Cancer Genome Atlas database analysis (P < 0.0001).

In most currently used planning methods, the uncertainties due to prostate motion are compensated by irradiating a larger treatment volume. However, this could cause underdosage of the treatment volume and overdosage of the organs at risk (OARs). To reduce this problem, in this proof of principle study we developed and evaluated a novel adaptive planning method. The strategy proposed corrects the dose delivered by each beam according to the actual position of the target in order to produce a final dose distribution dosimetrically as similar as possible to the prescribed one.  Material and methods:   Our adaptive planning method was tested on a phantom case and on a clinical case. For the first, a pilot study was performed on an in-silico pelvic phantom. A ""library"" of intensity modulated RT (IMRT) plans corresponding to possible positions of the prostate during a treatment fraction was generated at planning stage. Then a 3D random walk model was used to simulate possible displacements of the prostate during the treatment fraction. At treatment stage, at the end of each beam, based on the current position of the target, the beam from the library of plans, which could reproduce the best approximation of the prescribed dose distribution, was selected and delivered. In the clinical case, the same approach was used on two prostate cancer patients: for the first a tissue deformation was simulated in-silico and for the second a cone beam CT (CBCT) taken during the treatment was used to simulate an intra-fraction change. Then, dosimetric comparisons with the standard treatment plan and, for the second patient, also with an isocenter shift correction, were performed.  Results:   For the phantom case, the plan generated using the adaptive planning method was able to meet all the dosimetric requirements and to correct for a misdosage of 13% of the dose prescription on the prostate. For the first clinical case, the standard planning method caused underdosage of the seminal vesicles, respectively by 5% and 4% of the prescribed dose, when the position changes for the target were correctly taken into account. The proposed adaptive planning method corrected any possible missed target coverage, reducing at the same time the dose on the OARs. For the second clinical case, both with the standard planning strategy and with the isocenter shift correction target coverage was significantly worsened (in particular uniformity) and some organs exceeded some toxicity objectives. While with our approach, the most uniform coverage for the target was produced and systematically the lowest toxicity values for the organs at risk were achieved.  Conclusions:   In our proof of principle study, the adaptive planning method performed better than the standard planning and the isocenter shift methods for prostate EBRT. It improved the coverage of the treatment volumes and lowered the dose to the OARs. This planning method is particularly promising for hypofractionated IMRT treatments in which a higher precision and control on dose deposition are needed. Further studies will be performed to test more extensively the proposed adaptive planning method and to evaluate it at a full clinical level.""","""['Maria Antico', 'Peter Prinsen', 'Francesco Cellini', 'Alice Fracassi', 'Alfonso A Isola', 'David Cobben', 'Davide Fontanarosa']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Dosimetric evaluation of three adaptive strategies for prostate cancer treatment including pelvic lymph nodes irradiation.', 'Evaluation of online/offline image guidance/adaptation approaches for prostate cancer radiation therapy.', 'Towards automated on-line adaptation of 2-Step IMRT plans: QUASIMODO phantom and prostate cancer cases.', 'A review of dose calculation approaches with cone beam CT in photon and proton therapy.', 'Image-guided Adaptive Radiotherapy for Bladder Cancer.', 'Technical feasibility of online adaptive stereotactic treatments in the abdomen on a robotic radiosurgery system.', 'Dosimetric benefits of daily treatment plan adaptation for prostate cancer stereotactic body radiotherapy.', 'Personalized Treatment Planning Automation in Prostate Cancer Radiation Oncology: A Comprehensive Dosimetric Study.', 'Artificial intelligence (AI) and interventional radiotherapy (brachytherapy): state of art and future perspectives.', 'Adipocytes protect fibroblasts from radiation-induced damage by adiponectin secretion.']"""

Methods:   Two series of gallic acid derivatives i.e. esters and amides have been synthesized and characterized by FTIR, NMR and mass spectrometry. The compounds have been tested in vitro for their anticancer activity against wild type human ovarian cancer cell line A2780, prostate cancer cell line PC3 and normal human fibroblast cells 3T3. To completely characterize optimal anticancer activity, a comprehensive model using piecewise recursive Hill model is used to quantitatively assess the in vitro anticancer effect of the tested compounds as a function of concentration and exposure time for periods ranging from 24 to 72 h. A robust artificial intelligence approach i.e. the ""Support Vector Machine (SVM) Learning Algorithm"" is adopted to utilize the data obtained at different temporal values, to identify compounds that trail forecasting algorithm.  Results:   All the synthesized analogues were found biocompatible. Significantly low EC50 values indicated that tested compounds have potent anticancer activity against A2780 cell line in comparison to PC3 cells where only few compounds generated same impact at almost 200 times high dose. On the basis of EC50 values, compounds 7 h, 7 m, 9c, 9b, 7c, 7b and 7 g were identified as the most active anticancer agent against A2780. Three major patterns of drug response heterogeneity were observed for different compounds in the form of multiple Hill graphs and shallow slopes. The anticancer efficiency of the compounds was verified using Machine learning SVM regression learner algorithm. For compounds 7a, 7b, 7e, 7 g, 7o, 7 r, 9b, 9e-9 g higher accuracy was found in predicted and experimentally obtained end point potency in terms of % viability.  Conclusions:   Pharmacodynamics modeling of anticancer potential of the synthesized compounds revealed that drug efficacy and response heterogeneity could be modulated by changing the exposure time to optimize therapeutic impact. Combining experimental results with AI based drug action forecasting, compounds 7b, 7 g, and 9b may be tested further as potent anticancer agent for in vivo studies.

In this study, we performed sensitizing activity analysis of auriculasin (AC) to tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) in RC-58T/h/SA#4 primary prostate cancer cells without significant cytotoxicity in RWPE-1 prostate epithelial cells. Combined treatment with AC and TRAIL at optimal concentrations resulted in tumor-specific apoptotic cell death in RC-58T/h/SA#4 cells, characterized by DNA fragmentation, accumulation of apoptotic cell population, and nuclear condensation. Compared to single treatment with AC or TRAIL, co-treatment with AC and TRAIL significantly increased expression of Bax, cleaved PARP, AIF, endo G, and cytochrome c but decreased expression of phosphorylation of AKT and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), Bcl-2 and caspases-9, -8, -3, and -10. The sensitizing effect of AC to TRAIL was well correlated with inhibition of death receptor 5 (DR5) CHOP, and p53 expression. Moreover, pre-treatment with a chimeric blocking antibody for DR5 effectively reduced AC-TRAIL-induced cell death and apoptosis-related protein expression.

NFATc1, belonging to the NFAT family, is overexpressed in PCa and is correlated with the risk of recurrence after radical prostatectomy. MATERIAL AND METHODS In the present study, the expression of NFATc, c-myc, and PKM2 in PCa cells was regulated by lentiviruses and then detected by real-time PCR and Western blot analysis. Further, proliferation, invasion, and migration assays were performed. The glucose consumption and lactate production were assessed by biochemical detection. RESULTS We found that NFATc1 down-regulation significantly suppressed the proliferation and Warburg effect of PCa cells, concurrent with a decrease of c-myc and PKM2 expression. Likewise, the abilities of migration and invasion were also inhibited in NFATc1-silenced PCa cells. In addition, NFATc1 down-regulation-induced inhibition of cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and Warburg effect were counteracted by up-regulation of c-myc or PKM2. The expression of PKM2 was positively regulated by NFATc1 and c-myc expression. CONCLUSIONS These results indicate that NFATc1 down-regulation can suppress the proliferation, Warburg effect, and migration and invasion abilities of PCa cells, probably by regulating c-myc and PKM2 expression. NFATc1 may be a potential therapeutic target for PCa and could be used as a diagnosis or prognosis indicator of PCa.""","""['Yuanyuan Liu', 'Tao Liang', 'Xinkai Qiu', 'Xuxiao Ye', 'Zuowei Li', 'Binqiang Tian', 'Dongliang Yan']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Med Sci Monit""","""['The role of NFATc1 in prostate cancer progression: cyclosporine A and tacrolimus inhibit cell proliferation, migration, and invasion.', 'NFATc1 promotes prostate tumorigenesis and overcomes PTEN loss-induced senescence.', 'Inhibition of Proliferation, Migration, and Invasion by Knockdown of Pyruvate Kinase-M2 (PKM2) in Ovarian Cancer SKOV3 and OVCAR3 Cells.', 'The Oncogenic Potential of the Centromeric Border Protein FAM84B of the 8q24.21 Gene Desert.', 'Transcriptional regulation of cell invasion: AP-1 regulation of a multigenic invasion programme.', 'Proliferation, apoptosis and invasion of human lung cancer cells are associated with NFATc1.', 'Chronic Alcohol Exposure Promotes Cancer Stemness and Glycolysis in Oral/Oropharyngeal Squamous Cell Carcinoma Cell Lines by Activating NFAT Signaling.', 'Identification and validation of an immune signature associated with EMT and metabolic reprogramming for predicting prognosis and drug response in bladder cancer.', 'Construction of Glycolytic Regulator Gene Signature to Predict the Prognosis and Tumor Immune Cell Infiltration Levels for Prostate Cancer.', 'RNA-binding protein CELF2 inhibits breast cancer cell invasion and angiogenesis by downregulating NFATc1.']"""

Materials and methods:   A total of 21 patients with a mean ± SD prostate specific antigen of 7.4 ± 6.8 ng/ml and biochemical failure after nonoperative prostate cancer treatment underwent fluciclovine (18F) positron emission tomography-computerized tomography (mean 364.1 ± 37.7 MBq) and planning transrectal prostate ultrasound with 3-dimensional image reconstruction. Focal prostatic activity on positron emission tomography was delineated and co-registered with planning ultrasound. During the subsequent biopsy session computer generated 12-core template biopsies were performed and then fluciclovine defined targets were revealed and biopsied. Histological analysis of template and targeted cores were completed.  Results:   Template biopsy was positive for malignancy in 6 of 21 patients (28.6%), including 10 of 124 regions and 11 of 246 cores, vs targeted biopsy in 10 of 21 (47.6%), including 17 of 50 regions and 40 of 125 cores.

Methods:   Monolayer cells prepared from sphere culture of PC-3 cells were characterized for the presence of pluripotency and tumorigenicity. They were then applied to screen a compound library to find compounds that could induce morphology changes of cells. Mechanisms of action of compounds selected from the chemical library that induced the loss of pluripotency of cells were also investigated.  Results:   C5A cells prepared from PC-3 cell-derived sphere culture expressed pluripotency markers such as Oct4, Sox2, and Klf4. C5A cells were highly proliferative. They were invasive in vitro and tumorigenic in vivo. Some dopamine receptor antagonists such as thioridazine caused reduction of pluripotency markers and tumorigenicity. Thioridazine, unlike promazine, inhibited phosphorylation of AMPK in a dose dependent manner. BML-275, an AMPK inhibitor, also induced differentiation of C5A cells as seen with thioridazine whereas A769663, an AMPK activator, blocked its differentiation-inducing ability. Transfection of C5A cells with siRNAs of dopamine receptor subtypes revealed that knockdown of DRD2 or DRD4 induced morphology changes of C5A cells.  Conclusions:   Some dopamine receptor antagonists such as thioridazine can induce differentiation of CSC-like cells by inhibiting phosphorylation of AMPK.

The expression levels of miR‑122 and Rho‑associated protein kinase 2 (ROCK2) in prostate tumor and adjacent healthy tissues of patients, as well as in the serum of prostate carcinoma patients and healthy controls, were detected by reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Receiver operating characteristic curve and survival curve analyses were used to examine the diagnostic and prognostic values of serum miR‑122 for prostate carcinoma. In addition, miR‑122 mimic was transfected into prostate carcinoma cells, and the effects on cell proliferation and ROCK2 expression were explored by Cell Counting Kit‑8 and western blot assays, respectively. It was observed that miR‑122 was downregulated and ROCK2 was upregulated in tumor tissues as compared with their levels in adjacent healthy tissues. miR‑122 level in the serum was also markedly lower in prostate carcinoma patients in comparison with that in healthy controls. Furthermore, a low serum level of miR‑122 was found to effectively distinguish the prostate carcinoma patients from healthy controls and to be an indicator of poor survival.

DGAT1 has been recognized as an anti-obesity target; however, its role in the tumor microenvironment remains unclear. We postulated that, in prostate cancer (PCa) cells, augmented lipogenesis and growth are due to increased DGAT1 expression leading to microtubule-organizing center (MTOC) amplification. Thus, therapeutic targeting of DGAT1 potentially has tumor suppressive activity. We tested whether blocking DGAT1 in PCa cells altered MTOC and lipid signaling. Western blot and immunofluorescence were performed for MTOC and triglyceride mediators. Treatment with a DGAT1 inhibitor was evaluated. We found a stepwise increase in DGAT1 protein levels when comparing normal prostate epithelial cells to PCa cells, LNCaP and PC-3. Lipid droplets, MTOCs, and microtubule-regulating proteins were reduced in tumor cells treated with a DGAT1 inhibitor. Depletion of the non-centrosomal MTOC protein GM130 reduced PCa cell proliferation and migration. Inhibition of DGAT1 reduced tumor growth both in vitro and in vivo, and a negative feedback loop was discovered between DGAT1, PEDF, and GM130.

However, cancer communicators have yet to systematically leverage these naturally occurring interventions on social media as these events are difficult to identify as they are unfolding and little research has analyzed their effect on social media conversations. In this study, we add to the research by analyzing how a celebrity cancer announcement influenced Twitter conversations in terms of the volume of social media messages and the type of content. Over a 9-day period, during which actor Ben Stiller announced that he had been treated for prostate cancer, we collected 1.2 million Twitter messages about cancer. We conducted automated content analyses to identify how often common cancer sites (prostate, breast, colon, or lung) were discussed. Then, we used manual content analysis on a sample of messages to identify cancer continuum content (awareness, prevention, early detection, diagnosis, treatment, survivorship, and end of life). Chi-square analyses were implemented to evaluate changes in cancer site and cancer continuum content before and after the announcement. We found that messages related to prostate cancer increased significantly more than expected for 2 days following Stiller's announcement. However, the number of cancer messages that described other cancer locations either did not increase or did not increase by the same magnitude. In terms of message content, results showed larger than expected increases in diagnosis messages.

While the characteristic histopathological and immunohistochemical features of these lesions have been well established, little is known about their three-dimensional architecture. Our objective was to evaluate the three-dimensional organisation of common prostate epithelial lesions.  Methods and results:   500 μm-thick punches (n = 42) were taken from radical prostatectomy specimens, and stained with antibodies targeting keratin 8-18 and keratin 5 for identification of luminal and basal cells, respectively. Tissue samples were optically cleared in benzyl alcohol:benzyl benzoate and imaged using a confocal laser scanning microscope. The three-dimensional architecture of peripheral and transition zone glands was acinar, composed of interconnecting and blind-ending saccular tubules. In simple atrophy, partial atrophy and post-atrophic hyperplasia, the acinar structure was attenuated with branching blind-ending tubules from parental tubular structures. Three-dimensional imaging revealed a novel variant of prostate atrophy characterised by large Golgi-like atrophic spaces parallel to the prostate surface, which were represented by thin, elongated tubular structures on haematoxylin and eosin (H&E) slides. Conversely, adenosis lacked acinar organisation, so that it closely mimicked low-grade prostate cancer. High-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia displayed prominent papillary intraluminal protrusions but retained an acinar organisation, whereas intraductal carcinoma predominantly consisted of cribriform proliferations with either spheroid, ellipsoid or complex interconnecting lumens.  Conclusions:   While various prostate epithelial lesions might mimic malignancy on H&E slides, their three-dimensional architecture is acinar and clearly different from the tubular structure of prostate cancer, with adenosis as an exception.""","""['Esther I Verhoef', 'Wiggert A van Cappellen', 'Johan A Slotman', 'Gert-Jan Kremers', 'Patricia C Ewing-Graham', 'Adriaan B Houtsmuller', 'Martin E van Royen', 'Geert J L H van Leenders']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Histopathology""","""['Three-dimensional analysis reveals two major architectural subgroups of prostate cancer growth patterns.', 'Postatrophic hyperplasia of the prostate.

In our previous study, we described the radiosynthesis and preliminary evaluation of L-1-[18F]FETrp for PET imaging of breast cancer. The aim of this study was to investigate the in vivo imaging mechanism and further evaluate this radiotracer in more wide range types of cancers including prostate cancer, lung cancer, and glioma.  Procedures:   The mice bearing subcutaneous PC-3 prostate cancer, subcutaneous H2009 and H460 lung cancers, subcutaneous MDA-MB-231, orthotopic A549 lung cancer, and intracranial 73C glioma were employed to evaluate L-1-[18F]FETrp for PET imaging of cancer. The in vivo catabolism of L-1-[18F]FETrp in the tumor was studied by analysis of PC-3 extracts with radio-HPLC.  Results:   Small animal PET/CT imaging of L-1-[18F]FETrp visualized all tumors in these different mouse models with high accumulations of radioactivity in PC-3 (7.5 ± 0.6 % ID/g), H2009 (5.3 ± 0.8 % ID/g), H460 (9.0 ± 1.4 % ID/g), A549 (4.5 ± 0.5 % ID/g), and 73C (4.1 ± 0.7 % ID/g) tumors. The radio-HPLC analysis of PC-3 tumor extracts revealed that about 30 % of L-1-[18F]FETrp was converted into a highly polar radioactive metabolite. The uptake in H460 cancer was about 1.7-fold higher than that in H2009 cancer, which indicated L-1-[18F]FETrp could differentiate these subtypes of lung cancers (H2009 and H460) by imaging quantification. Furthermore, small animal PET/CT imaging in intracranial glioma revealed L-1-[18F]FETrp could pass blood-brain barrier (BBB) and accumulate in glioma with a favorable imaging contrast (tumor-to-brain 2.9).

However, the impact of the zonal origin (anterior or posterior tumor) of the tumor on the diagnosis of EPE is controversial.  Methods:   We retrospectively analyzed the records of 233 consecutive patients who underwent preoperative MRI and radical prostatectomy. We designated their tumors as anterior or posterior, and evaluated the correlation between the TCL measured by MRI and microscopic EPE in the radical prostatectomy specimen. Then, we created the predicted probability curves for EPE versus TCL for anterior and posterior prostate cancer.  Results:   There were 109 patients (47%) with an anterior tumor and 124 patients (53%) with a posterior tumor. Postoperative pathological analysis confirmed pT3 in 18 patients (17%) with an anterior tumor and in 53 patients (43%) with a posterior tumor. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that the zonal origin of the tumor was an independent predictive factor for EPE. We developed separate probability curves of EPE versus TCL for anterior and posterior prostate cancer, which revealed that anterior tumors were less likely to invade the extraprostatic tissues. Among patients whose TCL was 10-20 mm, 9/32 patients (28%) with an anterior tumor had EPE compared with 24/45 patients (53%) with a posterior tumor (p = 0.036). The decision curve of this EPE predictive model had high clinical efficacy.  Conclusions:   Our results indicate that anterior tumors have more favorable pathological characteristics than posterior tumors with the same TCL measured by MRI. We constructed two separate predicted probability curves for EPE after discriminating anterior and posterior tumors, which will be useful for decision making in clinical practice.""","""['Kazuhiro Matsumoto', 'Hirotaka Akita', 'Keiichi Narita', 'Akinori Hashiguchi', 'Kimiharu Takamatsu', 'Toshikazu Takeda', 'Takeo Kosaka', 'Ryuichi Mizuno', 'Eiji Kikuchi', 'Mototsugu Oya', 'Masahiro Jinzaki']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Prostate Cancer Prostatic Dis""","""['Can Extraprostatic Extension Be Predicted by Tumor-Capsule Contact Length in Prostate Cancer?

A relationship of cancer with cold is suspected since Inuit and Alaska Indians that live in even more extreme low temperatures have the higher cancer rates in the world. In this article, possible reasons for this phenomenon are discussed. These explanations are related with: evolutionary adaptation to extreme cold, the genetic background of Nordic people, the experimentally proven fast growth and metastasis of tumors at low temperatures, high concentration of certain air pollutants at cold environments, low levels of serum Vitamin D, overdiagnosis by the medical doctors and high quality of the health system in Nordic countries.

We also evaluated the expression of HO-1, FKBP51, and FKBP52 by Western Blot. Hemin pre-treatment reduced Dex-induced GR activity in PC3 cells. Protein levels of FKBP51, a cytoplasmic GR-binding immunophilin, were significantly increased in Hemin+Dex treated cells, possibly accounting for lower GR activity. We also evaluated these treatments in vivo using PC3 tumors growing as xenografts. We found non-significant differences in tumor growth among treatments.

Athymic nude mice (5⁻7 weeks old, male, Balb c/c nu/nu) with established tumor xenografts were fed a basal diet (AIN-93) with or without 1 µmoles I3C/g for 9 weeks. The effects of dietary I3C on gut microbial composition and microbial species interactions were then examined by 16s rRNA gene-based sequencing and co-occurrence network analysis. I3C supplementation significantly inhibited tumor growth (p < 0.0001) and altered the structure of gut microbiome. The abundance of the phylum Deferribacteres, more specifically, Mucispirillum schaedleri, was significantly increased by dietary I3C. Additionally, I3C consumption also changed gut microbial co-occurrence patterns. One of the network modules in the control group, consisting of seven bacteria in family S-27, was positively correlated with tumor size (p < 0.009). Moreover, dietary I3C disrupted microbial interactions and altered this association between specific microbial network and tumor development.

Years of potential life lost is defined as the difference between a predetermined end-point age and the age at death for a death that occurred prior to that end age, hence the AYPLL is calculated by dividing the total YPLL by the total number of patients died.  Methods:   The surveillance epidemiology and end results (SEER) database was used to identify Pca patients who were CA or AA and who have received radical prostatectomy or radiation therapy. Study duration was divided into four decades; 1973-1982 (D1), 1983-1992 (D2), 1993-2002 (D3), 2003-2012 (D4). Examined regions were; North East (NE), North central (NC), South and West. Tumor grade was classified into; well/moderately differentiated (WD/MD) and poorly/undifferentiated (PD/UD) groups. Differences in AYPLL among CA and AA in each of these variables were compared.  Results:   Overall, compared to CA, AA were diagnosed and died earlier from Pca. AA had higher AYPLL to Pca than CA. In both tumor grade groups, progressive increase in AYPLL among AA compared to CA was noted over the last three decades. In the WD/MD group, except for the South region, the highest recorded difference in AYPLL between AA and CA was in D4. In the PD/UD group, a similar difference in AYPLL between AA and CA was noted in all regions. The difference in AYPLL was higher in the PD/UD group than the WD/MD group.  Conclusions:   Racial disparity between AA and CA existed across the examined regions. It is more pronounced in advanced tumor grades.

Here we report the design and syntheses of a novel class of histidine-containing hexapeptide derivatives (Nap-1 and ID-1) for in situ hydrogelation at the zinc ion-rich prostate tissue. Thanks to the efficient co-ordination between zinc and histidine, both Nap-1 and ID-1 displayed excellent self-assembly capability with a high sensitivity to zinc ions at ∼0.1 equivalency. To foster a prostate-specific drug delivery system (DDS), ID-1 was chosen for further conjugation with bicalutamide (BLT), a clinically used drug for prostate cancer. The as-synthesized ID-1-BLT retained the self-assembly capability with zinc ions, and conferred supramoelcular hydrogels at the prostate site. Interestingly, ID-1-BLT hydrogels demonstrated tunable drug release profiles in a typical tumor microenvironment, with acidic pH and esterase activity regulating the drug release in a dose dependent manner. Consequently, the hydrogel-based DDS demonstrated enhanced potency and selective cytotoxicity against prostate cancer cell DU145 over normal fibroblast cell NIH3T3, plausibly due to differential cellular uptake of drugs as well as the elevated esterase activities in cancer cells.

Results:   A total of 515 803 prescriptions for LHRH analog were dispensed over a 5-year period (2008 to 2012) to 35 089 PCa patients. The mean age (±SD) was 77 years (±9). The %IAD in the cohort was 1.7% whereas the 5-year prevalence (PIAD ) was 4.2%. Only 2.5% of patients on IAD were on IAD for >6 months. Of the physicians (n = 1638) who prescribed hormonal treatment, 24% used IAD at least once. Total expenditures for LHRH analogs were 1.2% of total drug expenditure in this population.  Conclusions:   This study confirms the validity of the method developed to estimate IAD use based on electronic pharmacy dispensation data. Given the large potential clinical and economic benefits that greater use of IAD could provide, future studies are needed to confirm these findings and to identify new strategies to increase the use of IAD.""","""['José A Cordero', 'Gemma Sancho', 'Xavier Bonfill']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Pharmacoepidemiol Drug Saf""","""['Prevalence study of intermittent hormonal therapy of Prostate Cancer patients in Spain.', 'Intermittent androgen deprivation therapy may prolong the duration of androgen dependence of well-differentiated prostate cancer.', 'Potential benefits of intermittent androgen suppression therapy in the treatment of prostate cancer: a systematic review of the literature.', 'Intermittent androgen-deprivation therapy in prostate cancer: a critical review focused on phase 3 trials.', 'Intermittent androgen deprivation in prostate cancer patients: factors predictive of prolonged time off therapy.']"""

Materials and Methods: Overall 98 patients (92 males, 6 females) were included. Patient demographics, operative and postoperative variables, pathological parameters, complications, and functional outcomes were evaluated. Results: Mean age and American Society of Anesthesiologists score and body mass index were 60.9 years, 1.7 and 26 kg/m2, respectively. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy was given to 18 patients. Mean operation time, intraoperative estimated blood loss, and mean lymph node (LN) yield were 8.22 hours, 314.6 mL, and 28.3, respectively. Mean hospitalization time was 13.6 days. There were one perioperative and one postoperative deaths, both due to cardiac arrest on postoperative 21st and 60th days. Drains were removed at a mean of 10 days. Surgical margins were positive in two patients. Postoperative pathological stages were reported as pT0 (n = 21), pTis (n = 7), pT1 (n = 7), pT2a (n = 14), pT2b (n = 14), pT3a (n = 15), pT3b (n = 11), and pT4a (n = 9).

Materials and methods:   This retrospective study included 84 patients who underwent multiparametric prostate MRI at 3 Tesla without endorectal coil. DWIs were acquired at three different b values which included two lower b values (b = 50,900 s/mm2) and one higher b value (aHBV at 2000 s/mm2). The acquired data were postprocessed to generate two different types of trace-weighted images-using conventional magnitude-averaging and complex-averaging. Using lower b values (b = 50,900 s/mm2) from both conventional and complex-averaged image sets, cHBV images (b = 2000 s/mm2) and ADC maps were derived. All image sets were reviewed by two radiologists in different reading sessions to assess image quality and PIRADS. The diagnostic accuracy of different image sets for the detection of prostate lesions was performed by correlating PIRADS and Gleason scores.  Results:   Complex-averaging did not impact ADC values of the prostate lesions compared to magnitude-averaging (P = 0.08). Complex-averaging improved image quality of acquired high b value and calculated high b value images (P < 0.0001). Complex-averaging also improved the level of confidence (LOC) of the acquired high b value for both readers (P < 0.0001, P < 0.05), but only for reader A in calculated high b value (P < 0.0001). The image quality of calculated high b value images was not significantly different than acquired high b value images. The dataset combining complex-averaging and calculated high b value provided the highest diagnostic accuracy (but not statistically significant) for detection of the significant prostate lesion compared to the magnitude-averaged acquired high b value (79.55% vs. 72.73%; P = 0.317). The mean acquisition time for b = 2000 s/mm2 sequence (aHBV) was 6 min 30 s (± 1 min 16 s) out of a total of 28 min 31 s (± 4 min 26 s) for the entire mp-MRI protocol (approximately 25% of total scan time).  Conclusion:   Complex-averaging provides better image quality and level of confidence without significant impact on ADC values and diagnostic accuracy for detection of the significant prostate lesions . The calculated high b value images are also comparable to (and can substitute) the acquired high b value images which can help in reducing the imaging time.""","""['Hamed Kordbacheh', 'Ravi Teja Seethamraju', 'Elisabeth Weiland', 'Berthold Kiefer', 'Marcel Dominik Nickel', 'Thitinan Chulroek', 'Martina Cecconi', 'Vinit Baliyan', 'Mukesh G Harisinghani']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Abdom Radiol (NY)""","""['Diffusion-weighted imaging of the prostate: Comparison of b1000 and b2000 image sets for index lesion detection.', 'Multiparametric MRI in detection and staging of prostate cancer.', 'Evaluation of Diffusion Kurtosis Imaging Versus Standard Diffusion Imaging for Detection and Grading of Peripheral Zone Prostate Cancer.', 'What is the optimal b value in diffusion-weighted MR imaging to depict prostate cancer at 3T?', 'Prostate MRI: Is Endorectal Coil Necessary?-A Review.', 'Enhanced Image Processing Using Complex Averaging in Diffusion-Weighted Imaging of the Prostate: The Impact on Image Quality and Lesion Detectability.', 'Automated deep-learning system in the assessment of MRI-visible prostate cancer: comparison of advanced zoomed diffusion-weighted imaging and conventional technique.', 'Comparison of Computed Diffusion-Weighted Imaging b2000 and Acquired Diffusion-Weighted Imaging b2000 for Detection of Prostate Cancer.', 'Prostate MRI quality: a critical review of the last 5 years and the role of the PI-QUAL score.']"""

FGFR2 is also present in the nucleus, which raises a question on a new role of FGFR2 in regulating gene expression. Hypoxia-inducible factors 1 and 2 (HIF-1 and HIF-2) are nuclear proteins that transactivate many genes essential for cancer survival and metastasis under hypoxic conditions. Here, we investigated if nuclear FGFR2 modulates the HIF-driven hypoxic response. Using the TCGA database, we found that FGFR2 downregulation is associated with poor prognosis in prostate cancer. A gene-set enrichment analysis showed that metastasis- and hypoxia-related genes are associated with a low expression of FGFR2 in prostate cancer. Thus, we tested the possibility that FGFR2 negatively regulates the hypoxia-triggered metastasis of prostate cancer. FGFR2 controls migration and invasion of prostate cancer cells under hypoxia by inhibiting the HIF-driven gene expression. FGFR2 and HIF proteins co-localize and associate in the nucleus under hypoxia. FGFR2 interacts with the transactivation domain of HIF-1α and blocks the recruitment of coactivator p300, resulting in repression of HIF target genes.

Despite their importance, few compounds based on the Mefloquine nucleus have been synthesized and evaluated against TB.  Materials and methods:   For the synthesis of all the compounds based on the Mefloquine nucleus we used a synthetic route which utilized the key derivative 4-methoxy-2,8-bis(trifluoromethyl)quinoline 2 as starting material. The compounds 3 (a-c), 4 (a-b) were synthesized after one step by reaction of 2 with appropriate amines substituted. The chloro derivatives 5 and 6 were obtained from compounds 4b and 4a by treatment with SOCl2 in CH2Cl2 at reflux in 75 and 80% yield, respectively. The analogue 6 was converted to 7 after treatment with ethanolamine under heating at 90oC in 64% yield and to the azido derivative 8 in 56% after reaction with sodium azide in MeOH at reflux for 2 h. The analogue 9 was obtained after reaction of 5 with ethanolamine at 90oC for 1 h in 90% yield. All the new compounds were identified by detailed spectral data, including 1H NMR, 13C NMR and high resolution mass spectra. All the compound were evaluated for their in vitro antibacterial activity against sensitive Mycobacterium tuberculosis ATCC 27294, using the microplate Alamar Blue assay (MABA). The more active compounds 3c, 7, and 9 were also evaluated against resistant strain SR 2571/0215 (resistant to Rifampicin and Isoniazid) by above method. All compounds were tested against three cancer cell lines: SF-295 (glioblastoma), HCT-116 (colon) and PC-3 (prostate) using the MTT assay.  Results:   All the planned ten compounds were synthetically obtained in good global yield, displaying activity against sensitive Mycobacterium tuberculosis in vitro, with exception of one, with MIC values between 37.2 and 154.8 µM. The compounds 3c (37.2 µM), 7 (68.1 µM) and 9 (65.6 µM) showed the highest activity in this series with MIC values similar when compare to the standard Mefloquine (30 - 60 µM), being 3c the most potent. The more active compounds 3c, 7, and 9 were also evaluated against resistant strain, displaying MIC of 37.2, 136.2 and 65.6 µM, respectively. All compounds were tested against three cancer cell lines and showed low cytotoxicity.  Conclusion:   All synthesized compounds, with the exception of 5, exhibited activity against the Mtb. Compound 3c was the most potent against resistant and sensitive Mtb in this series, with MIC value of 37.2 µM. All compounds showed low cytotoxicity.

This study evaluated direct costs of treating urinary problems after PCa treatments and determined predictors of long-term costs for urinary problems. Data from the Cancer of Prostate Strategic Urologic Research Endeavor registry was analyzed for this study. Annual treatment costs for urinary problems for up to 14 years were compared among different primary PCa treatments, which included radical prostatectomy, external beam radiation therapy, brachytherapy, and watchful waiting. A multivariate generalized estimating equation (GEE) model with bootstrapping was estimated to identify the predictors associated with treatment costs for urinary problems. A total of 3,062 eligible patients were identified with a mean age of 65 years at diagnosis. Mean annual treatment cost for urinary problems across all patients with PCa was $118/patient. Those greater than 74 years old had the highest cost ($238/patient). Mean annual cost for urinary problems among only those with urinary problems was $432.

This entails speaking with a provider to discuss the potential advantages, disadvantages, and uncertainties about the PSA screening test. The purpose of this study was to examine (a) the reported level of being informed about the PSA test by race and (b) the association between the receipt of the PSA test and participants reporting that they were informed about the test. U.S. adult males (ages 40-74 years) were identified from the 2015 Behavioral Risk Factors Surveillance System (BRFSS; n = 3,877). Chi-square analysis assessed bivariate differences among men who received different levels of PSA screening information. Binomial logistic regression models assessed the relationship of race/ethnicity and the receipt of the PSA test on being informed about the PSA test. Over half (54.3%) of the sample had a PSA test and most (72.0%) reported that they did not receive information about both the advantages and disadvantages (being informed) of the PSA test. Black men (40.3%) were significantly most likely to report being informed ( p < .001), and 61.3% reported receipt of a recommendation from their provider ( p < .001). White men (63.1%) were significantly more likely to report receiving the PSA test. Findings indicate that more men reported receiving the PSA test than men who reported being informed about it.

Therefore, GRPr is a possible theragnostic target. An interesting antagonist GRPr-ligand is RM2 or BAY86-7548. This study examines the accuracy of positron emission tomography (PET) with [68Ga]Ga-RM2 for diagnostic imaging of primary PCa (pPCa) compared to histopathology in patients undergoing radical prostatectomy (RP).  Methods:   [68Ga]Ga-RM2-PET examinations were performed in 15 patients before RP. All prostate specimens were histopathologically examined based on predefined spatial octants. Each prostate volume on PET was subdivided into octants, which were correlated to histopathology and evaluated according to presence of tumor by two experienced examiners. Additionally, PET data was evaluated by volume of interest (VOI) analyses in terms of maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) and normalized SUVmax relative to background activity (rSUVmax). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves for SUVmax and rSUVmax were calculated.  Results:   At least one focus of increased [68Ga]Ga-RM2 uptake corresponding to a tumor manifestation on histology was found in 14 of 15 patients (93%). Spatial concordance of visual PET readings with histopathology was very variable. Intraindividual agreement reached from ≤2 octants in three, 3-5 octants in six to ≥6 octants in six patients, resulting in a relatively low correlation of visual PET readings with histopathology (accuracy = 0.63; p = 0.0018). Lesion-based analysis found a sensitivity of 69% and a positive predictive value of 73%. Concordantly, the octant-based ROC curves for SUVmax and rSUVmax indicated a relatively low diagnostic performance (area under the curve of 0.59 and 0.61, respectively).  Conclusions:   [68Ga]Ga-RM2-PET shows only a relatively low diagnostic accuracy for pPCa compared to histopathology on an octant basis, which may be explained to some extent by methodological weaknesses. Further studies need to explore, whether the observed high interindividual variability of agreement between [68Ga]Ga-RM2-PET and histopathology can be explained by different tumor biologies or other coincident prostatic pathologies.""","""['Thomas F Fassbender', 'Florian Schiller', 'Michael Mix', 'Helmut R Maecke', 'Selina Kiefer', 'Vanessa Drendel', 'Philipp T Meyer', 'Cordula A Jilg']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Nucl Med Biol""","""['Value of 68Ga-labeled bombesin antagonist (RM2) in the detection of primary prostate cancer comparing with 18Ffluoromethylcholine PET-CT and multiparametric MRI-a phase I/II study.', 'Prospective Study of the Radiolabeled GRPR Antagonist BAY86-7548 for Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography Imaging of Newly Diagnosed Prostate Cancer.', 'Diagnosis of recurrent prostate cancer with PET/CT imaging using the gastrin-releasing peptide receptor antagonist 68Ga-RM2: Preliminary results in patients with negative or inconclusive 18FFluoroethylcholine-PET/CT.', 'More advantages in detecting bone and soft tissue metastases from prostate cancer using 18F-PSMA PET/CT.', 'PET Imaging Using Gallium-68 (68Ga) RM2.', 'A prospective comparative study of 68GaGa-RM26 and 68GaGa-PSMA-617 PET/CT imaging in suspicious prostate cancer.', 'Value of 68Ga-labeled bombesin antagonist (RM2) in the detection of primary prostate cancer comparing with 18Ffluoromethylcholine PET-CT and multiparametric MRI-a phase I/II study.', 'Potential Targets Other Than PSMA for Prostate Cancer Theranostics: A Systematic Review.', 'More Than Meets the Eye: Scientific Rationale behind Molecular Imaging and Therapeutic Targeting of Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen (PSMA) in Metastatic Prostate Cancer and Beyond.', 'New Frontiers in Molecular Imaging Using Peptide-Based Radiopharmaceuticals for Prostate Cancer.']"""

Methods and materials:   Between 1993 and 1998, 301 patients with biopsy-proven clinical stage T1b-T3 prostate adenocarcinoma, any prostate-specific antigen level, and any Gleason score were randomized to 70 Gy in 35 fractions versus 78 Gy in 39 fractions of photon radiation therapy using a 4-field box technique without hormone deprivation therapy. The primary outcome was powered to detect a 15% difference in biochemical or clinical failure. Secondary outcomes included survival, prostate cancer mortality, biochemical failure, local failure, nodal failure, distant failure, and secondary malignancy rates.  Results:   With a median follow-up of 14.3 years, the cumulative incidence of 15-year biochemical or clinical failure was 18.9% versus 12.0% in the 70 Gy versus 78 Gy arms, respectively (subhazard ratio [sHR], 0.61; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.38-0.98; Fine-Gray P = .042). The 15-year cumulative incidence of distant metastasis was 3.4% versus 1.1%, respectively (sHR, 0.33; 95% CI, 0.13-0.82; Fine-Gray P = .018). The 15-year cumulative incidence of prostate cancer-specific mortality was 6.2% versus 3.2%, respectively, (sHR, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.27-0.98; Fine-Gray P = .045). There were no differences in overall survival (HR, 1.10; 95% CI, 0.84-1.45; log rank P = .469) or other-cause survival (sHR, 1.33; 95% CI, 0.99-1.79; Fine-Gray P = .061). Salvage therapy was more common in the 70 Gy arm, at 38.7% versus 21.9% in the 78 Gy arm (P = .002). There was a 2.3% secondary solid malignancy rate (1 bladder, 6 rectal) within the radiation treatment field, which was not significantly different between treatment arms.  Conclusions:   Dose escalation by 8 Gy (78 Gy vs 70 Gy) provided a sustained improvement in biochemical and clinical failure, which translated into lower salvage rates and improved prostate cancer-specific mortality, but not overall survival.

The proposed method relies on an undersampled multi-shot DW turbo-STEAM sequence with rotated radial trajectories and a multi-step inverse reconstruction with denoised multi-shot phase maps. The total acquisition time was below 6 min for a resolution of 1.4 × 1.4 × 3.5 mm3 and six directions at b = 600 s mm-2 . Studies of eight healthy subjects and two patients with prostate cancer were performed at 3 T employing an 18-channel body-array coil and elements of the spine coil. The method was compared with conventional DW echo-planar imaging (EPI) of the prostate. The results confirm that DW STEAM MRI avoids geometric distortions and false image intensities, which were present for both single-shot EPI (ssEPI) and readout-segmented EPI, particularly near the intestinal wall of the prostate. Quantitative accuracy of the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) was validated with use of a numerical phantom providing ground truth. ADC values in the central prostate gland of healthy subjects were consistent with those measured using ssEPI and with literature data. Preliminary results for patients with prostate cancer revealed a correct anatomical localization of lesions with respect to T2 -weighted MRI in both mean DW STEAM images and ADC maps. In summary, DW STEAM MRI of the prostate offers clinically relevant advantages for the diagnosis of prostate cancer compared with state-of-the-art EPI-based approaches.

Materials and methods:   A total of 436 men underwent transperineal prostate mapping biopsy at 2 institutions. Biopsy density was calculated as the ratio of the total number of specimens retrieved (mean 59.4) to prostate volume (mean 44.9 cc). Associations of biopsy density with prostate specific antigen, prostate specific antigen density, cancer diagnosis and the Gleason score were tested by ANOVA and the chi-square test. Regression analysis was done to determine factors associated with a positive transperineal prostate mapping biopsy and Gleason score 7 or higher cancer.  Results:   Transperineal prostate mapping biopsy was positive in 299 of 436 men (68.6%). The mean number of positive cores was 7.1 (range 1 to 41) and mean biopsy density was 1.46 (range 0.39 to 3.67). The mean number of cores in positive vs negative transperineal prostate mapping biopsies was 1.61 vs 1.14 (p <0.001). Biopsy density cut points of 0.5 or less, greater than 0.5 to 1.0, greater than 1.0 to 1.5 and greater than 1.5 were associated with positive biopsy in 25%, 37.4%, 70.7% and 84.9% of patients (p <0.001). Dichotomizing biopsy density to 1.5 or less vs greater than 1.5 resulted in a positive biopsy rate of 56.4% vs 84.9% (OR 1.5, 95% CI 1.3-1.7, p <0.001). More Gleason score 6 cancers were diagnosed with higher biopsy density (94 of 158 or 59.5% vs 62 of 141 or 44.9%, p = 0.007). However, the number of positive cores with Gleason score 6 was greater in men with higher biopsy density at 4.9 vs 3.6 (p = 0.036). Prostate specific antigen (p = 0.053) and biopsy density (p = 0.012) were significant on regression analysis for positive transperineal prostate mapping biopsy and Gleason score 7+ disease.

Materials and methods:   Beginning in October 2016 transperineal prostate biopsy was performed using local anesthesia in all patients undergoing prostate biopsy. Data on prebiopsy characteristics and results, including the cancer detection rate, complications and patient tolerability scores, were collected retrospectively from patient records.  Results:   The cancer detection rate of transperineal prostate biopsy was 49.8% (641 of 1,287 patients). Clinically significant prostate cancer was detected in 385 patients and 62 (9.7%) had exclusively anterior zone pathology findings. Urinary retention developed in 20 patients (1.6%) following transperineal prostate biopsy, requiring temporary catheterization. In 4 patients (0.3%) lower urinary tract symptoms were suggestive of infection but only 1 had a positive urine culture. The only hospital admission was for a patient with persistent hypotension after biopsy. Patients tolerated transperineal prostate biopsy reasonably well and generally reported only mild levels of discomfort on a pain visual analogue scale. Infiltration of the anesthesia was rated more painful than the biopsy.  Conclusions:   Transperineal prostate biopsy with the patient under local anesthesia is a feasible alternative to transrectal biopsy in the detection of prostate cancer. Transperineal prostate biopsy has an acceptable cancer detection rate with additional detection of anterior zone cancers. It is a safer alternative in patients due to the low risk of complications, in particular urosepsis, and it is well tolerated.

However, mp-MRI for PCa diagnosis is currently limited by the qualitative or semi-quantitative interpretation criteria, leading to inter-reader variability and a suboptimal ability to assess lesion aggressiveness. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are a powerful method to automatically learn the discriminative features for various tasks, including cancer detection. We propose a novel multi-class CNN, FocalNet, to jointly detect PCa lesions and predict their aggressiveness using Gleason score (GS). FocalNet characterizes lesion aggressiveness and fully utilizes distinctive knowledge from mp-MRI. We collected a prostate mp-MRI dataset from 417 patients who underwent 3T mp-MRI exams prior to robotic-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy. FocalNet was trained and evaluated in this large study cohort with fivefold cross validation. In the free-response receiver operating characteristics (FROC) analysis for lesion detection, FocalNet achieved 89.7% and 87.9% sensitivity for index lesions and clinically significant lesions at one false positive per patient, respectively. For the GS classification, evaluated by the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis, FocalNet received the area under the curve of 0.81 and 0.79 for the classifications of clinically significant PCa (GS ≥ 3 + 4) and PCa with GS ≥ 4 + 3, respectively. With the comparison to the prospective performance of radiologists using the current diagnostic guideline, FocalNet demonstrated comparable detection sensitivity for index lesions and clinically significant lesions, only 3.4% and 1.5% lower than highly experienced radiologists without statistical significance.""","""['Ruiming Cao', 'Amirhossein Mohammadian Bajgiran', 'Sohrab Afshari Mirak', 'Sepideh Shakeri', 'Xinran Zhong', 'Dieter Enzmann', 'Steven Raman', 'Kyunghyun Sung']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""IEEE Trans Med Imaging""","""['Multiparametric MRI in detection and staging of prostate cancer.', 'Performance of Deep Learning and Genitourinary Radiologists in Detection of Prostate Cancer Using 3-T Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging.', 'ProstAttention-Net: A deep attention model for prostate cancer segmentation by aggressiveness in MRI scans.', 'Co-trained convolutional neural networks for automated detection of prostate cancer in multi-parametric MRI.', 'The role of radiomics in prostate cancer radiotherapy.', 'Anatomically guided self-adapting deep neural network for clinically significant prostate cancer detection on bi-parametric MRI: a multi-center study.', 'Tumor Area Highlighting Using T2WI, ADC Map, and DWI Sequence Fusion on bpMRI Images for Better Prostate Cancer Diagnosis.', 'Joint Cancer Segmentation and PI-RADS Classification on Multiparametric MRI Using MiniSegCaps Network.', 'The added value of AI-based computer-aided diagnosis in classification of cancer at prostate MRI.', 'Automated deep-learning system in the assessment of MRI-visible prostate cancer: comparison of advanced zoomed diffusion-weighted imaging and conventional technique.']"""

Due to limited follow-up time, clinical trials rarely report this measure, whereas they often report hazard ratios comparing treatment groups.  Aim:   We aimed to explore the empirical relationship between gain in mean survival time and the hazard ratio for cancer patients.  Methods:   We included all patients in Norway diagnosed from 1965 through 2004 with late-stage cancer at the point of diagnosis and with one of the following cancers: stomach, colon, rectal, pancreas, lung and trachea, kidney excluding renal pelvis, and metastasized breast and prostate. Patients were followed until emigration, death, or June 30, 2016, whichever came first. Observed mean survival times and hazard ratios were obtained in subcohorts defined by patients' sex, age, cancer type, and time period of diagnosis, which had nearly complete follow-up. Based on theoretical considerations, we fitted a linear relationship between observed differences in mean survival and logarithmic hazard ratios. For validation, we estimated differences in mean survival from hazard ratios of bootstrap samples with artificially induced censoring and compared with fitting a Weibull distribution.  Results:   The relationship between differences in mean survival time and corresponding logarithmic hazard ratios was linear for each of the included cancers. The predicted differences in mean survival of the empirical approach generally had smaller bias than the Weibull approach.  Conclusion:   For cancer diagnoses with poor prognosis, differences in mean survival times could be predicted from corresponding hazard ratios. This hazard ratio-based approach outperforms or is similar to fitting Weibull models to data with incomplete follow-up, while making fewer assumptions.""","""['Eeva-Liisa Røssell Johansen', 'Mette Lise Lousdal', 'Mette Vinther Skriver', 'Michael Væth', 'Ivar Sønbø Kristiansen', 'Henrik Støvring']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Med Decis Making""","""['Predicting Mean Survival Time from Reported Median Survival Time for Cancer Patients.', 'Predicting difference in mean survival time from cause-specific hazard ratios for women diagnosed with breast cancer.', 'Italian cancer figures--Report 2015: The burden of rare cancers in Italy.', 'A rapid and systematic review of the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of topotecan for ovarian cancer.', 'Hormonal therapies for early breast cancer: systematic review and economic evaluation.', 'Elderly Patients with Nondistant Metastatic Pancreatic Head Adenocarcinoma Cannot Benefit from More Radical Surgery.', 'Novel Risk Modeling Approach of Atrial Fibrillation With Restricted Mean Survival Times: Application in the Framingham Heart Study Community-Based Cohort.']"""

In the present study, we documented that doxorubicin (Dox) or cisplatin-induced prostate cancer (PCa) chemoresistance is predominantly mediated by the induction of ABCG4 in androgen-independent PCa cells. Treatment of DU-145 or PC-3 cells with Dox significantly enhanced the expression of ABCG4 that resulted in the efflux of intracellular Dox. However, incubation of cells with ABCG4 short hairpin RNA resulted in a significant accumulation of Dox and sensitized cells to Dox-induced cytotoxicity. Interestingly, simvastatin synergistically potentiated Dox-induced cytotoxicity by inhibiting ABCG4 in DU-145 and DU-145 Doxres cells. Mechanistically, ABCG4 expression was regulated redox-dependently by intracellular glutathione (GSH) levels. Treatment of cells with N-acetylcysteine or simvastatin restored Dox-induced depletion of GSH levels that in turn inhibited ABCG4 levels. In addition, a reduction in GSH levels by Dox caused a nuclear factor-κB dependent enhancement of c-Myc expression, which led to cAMP-regulatory element-binding protein (CREB) activation. Furthermore, chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that Dox-induced CREB activation transcriptionally upregulates ABCG4 expression. These results were further confirmed in an in vivo PCa xenograft mice model. Combination of simvastatin and Dox significantly regressed the tumor growth and size with no noticeable Dox-induced cardiotoxic side effects. Intriguingly, DU-145 cells with stably depleted ABCG4 levels not only significantly delayed the development of the tumor but also greatly sensitized the tumor to a low dose of Dox that resulted in complete tumor regression. Collectively, this data reinforces a novel function of ABCG4 in Dox-mediated chemoresistance, and as a potential therapeutic target in drug-induced PCa chemoresistance.""","""['Sreevidya Mallappa', 'Praveen K Neeli', 'Santosh Karnewar', 'Srigiridhar Kotamraju']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Mol Carcinog""","""['siRNAs targeting multidrug transporter genes sensitise breast tumour to doxorubicin in a syngeneic mouse model.', 'Sildenafil (Viagra) sensitizes prostate cancer cells to doxorubicin-mediated apoptosis through CD95.', 'Nelfinavir targets multiple drug resistance mechanisms to increase the efficacy of doxorubicin in MCF-7/Dox breast cancer cells.', 'The related miRNAs involved in doxorubicin resistance or sensitivity of various cancers: an update.', 'Long non-coding RNAs in the doxorubicin resistance of cancer cells.', 'Study on mechanism of elemene reversing tumor multidrug resistance based on luminescence pharmacokinetics in tumor cells in vitro and in vivo.', 'A Screening Study for the Development of Simvastatin-Doxorubicin Liposomes, a Co-Formulation with Future Perspectives in Colon Cancer Therapy.', 'Statin as a Potential Chemotherapeutic Agent: Current Updates as a Monotherapy, Combination Therapy, and Treatment for Anti-Cancer Drug Resistance.', 'Modulation of STAT3 Signaling, Cell Redox Defenses and Cell Cycle Checkpoints by β-Caryophyllene in Cholangiocarcinoma Cells: Possible Mechanisms Accounting for Doxorubicin Chemosensitization and Chemoprevention.', 'A novel metadherinΔ7 splice variant enhances triple negative breast cancer aggressiveness by modulating mitochondrial function via NFĸB-SIRT3 axis.']"""

As acetylation and deacetylation regulate β-catenin stability, we searched for histone acetyltransferases (HATs) or histone deacetylases (HDACs) affecting δ-catenin acetylation status and protein levels. We showed that p300/CBP-associated factor (PCAF) directly bound to and acetylated δ-catenin, whereas several class I and class II HDACs reversed this effect. Unlike β-catenin, δ-catenin was downregulated by PCAF-mediated acetylation and upregulated by HDAC-mediated deacetylation. The HDAC inhibitor trichostatin A attenuated HDAC1-mediated δ-catenin upregulation, whereas HAT or autophagy inhibitors, but not proteasome inhibitors, abolished PCAF-mediated δ-catenin downregulation. The results suggested that PCAF-mediated δ-catenin acetylation promotes its autophagic degradation in an Atg5/LC3-dependent manner. Deletions or point mutations identified several lysine residues in different δ-catenin domains involved in PCAF-mediated δ-catenin downregulation. PCAF overexpression in prostate cancer cells markedly reduced δ-catenin levels and suppressed cell growth and motility. PCAF-mediated δ-catenin downregulation inhibited E-cadherin processing and decreased the nuclear distribution of β-catenin, resulting in the suppression of β-catenin/LEF-1-mediated downstream effectors.

Antiandrogens effectively inactivate the AR, but subsequent AR reactivation progresses the disease to castrate-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Constitutively active AR splice variants (AR-V) that function unchallenged by current AR-targeted therapies are key drivers of CRPC. Currently, very little is known about the regulation of AR-Vs at the chromatin level. Here, we show that the pioneer factor GATA2 is a critical regulator of AR-Vs. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the GATA2 cistrome in CRPC shares considerable overlap with bromodomain and extraterminal (BET) proteins and is codependent for DNA binding. GATA2 activity is compromised by BET inhibitors, which attenuates the pioneering role of GATA2 in CRPC. In all, this study indicates that GATA2 is a critical regulator of AR-V-mediated transactivation and is sensitive to BET inhibitors, signifying these agents may be efficacious in patients with CRPC which overexpress GATA2.

Material and methods:   A retrospective study of 205 patients with at least one negative PB. 144 (70.2%) patients underwent a prior mpMRI and 61 (29.8%) patients did not. Nodule classification was carried out according PI-RADS version 2. Peripheral zone (PZ) grouped pZa, pZpl and pZpm areas, transition zone (TZ) Tza, Tzp and Cz areas, and anterior zone (AZ) AS areas. COG-TB was conducted in patients with previous mpMRI (144); while in the remaining 61 (29.8%) patients a ClTB of PZ and TZ was performed. Statistical analysis was performed using Chi square and T-student tests for qualitative and quantitative variables, respectively. Multivariate analysis was carried out in order to identify predictive variables of prostate cancer.  Results:   Median patient age was 68 (IQR 62-72) years, median PSA was 8.3 (IQR 6.2-11.7) ng/ml and median previous biopsies was 1 (IQR 1-2). Digital rectal examinations (DRE) findings were normal in 169 (82.4%) patients and suspicious in 36 (17.6%) patients (cT2a-b in 34 patients and cT2c in 2). Median prostate volume was 48 (IQR 38-65) cc. Statistically significant differences in PSAD between both groups were found (P=.03). Transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) showed hypoechoic nodules in 8 (13.1%) ClTB patients and in 62 (43.1%) COG-TB patients (P=.0001). The median number of biopsy cylinders per set of prostate biopsies was 10 (IQR 10-10) in ClTB group and 11 (IQR 9-13) in COG-TB group (P=.75). Cancer was diagnosed in 74 (36.1%) patients: of them, 10 (16.4%) were ClTB patients and 64 (44.4%) COG-TB (P=.0001). Tumors classification was as follow: ISUP-1: 34 (45.9%), ISUP-2: 21 (28.4%), ISUP-3: 9 (12.2%), ISUP-4: 7 (9.5%) and ISUP-5: 3 (4.1%). No significant statistical differences were found (P=.89). The median number of biopsy cylinders impaired per set of prostate biopsies was 1 (IQR 1-5) in ClTB group and 2 (IQR 1-4) in COG-TB group (P=.93). Regarding independent predictive variables for prostate cancer the results were: age (OR=12.05; P=.049), suspicious DRE (OR=2.64; P=.04), hypoechoic nodule (OR=2.20; P=.03) and mpMRI +COG-TB sequence (OR=3.49; P=.003).

However, unlike for the other Ephedra species, there have been no reports on the antioxidant and cytotoxic effects of this plant. The present study aims to explore the potential applications of E. chilensis extract as a cytotoxic agent against in vitro cancer cell lines and to explore the relationship between this extract and antioxidant activity.  Methods:   Total anthraquinone, flavonoid, and phenolic contents, as well as antioxidant activity (DPPH, FRAP, and TRAP assays) and cytotoxic effect on several cancer cell lines (MCF-7, PC-3, DU-145, and HT-29) were measured for the hexane, dichloromethane and ethanol extracts of E. chilensis. In addition, several correlations among the phytochemical content, antioxidant activity, and cytotoxic effect were evaluated. Finally, GC-MS analyses of the most active extracts were carried out to identify their major components and to relate these components to the cytotoxic effect.  Results:   Antioxidant activity was found in the EtOH extracts of Ephedra, and the results were correlated with the phenolic content. For the cytotoxic activity, the non-polar extracts of E. chilensis had the highest antiproliferative effect for the MCF-7 and PC-3 cancer lines; the extract was shown to be up to three times more selective than doxorubicin. However, the cytotoxic effect was not correlated with the antioxidant activity. Lastly, the GC-MS analysis showed a high concentration of saturated fatty acids (mainly n-hexadecanoic acid) and terpenoids (mainly 4-(hydroxy-ethyl)-γ-butanolactone).  Conclusion:   The cytotoxic activity and selectivity of the non-polar extracts of E. chilensis for the MCF-7 and PC-3 cell lines could be related to the terpenic compounds and fatty acids of the extracts or to the synergistic effect of all of the compounds in the extracts. These non-polar extracts can be used for the development of new drugs against breast and prostate cancer.""","""['Marco Mellado', 'Mauricio Soto', 'Alejandro Madrid', 'Iván Montenegro', 'Carlos Jara-Gutiérrez', 'Joan Villena', 'Enrique Werner', 'Patricio Godoy', 'Luis F Aguilar']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""BMC Complement Altern Med""","""['In vitro investigation of cytotoxic and antioxidative activities of Ardisia crispa against breast cancer cell lines, MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231.', 'In vitro anticancer, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant potentials of Ephedra aphylla.', 'Phytochemical Characterization and Evaluation of the Antimicrobial, Antiproliferative and Pro-Apoptotic Potential of Ephedra alata Decne.

Importantly, clinical evidence also proposed that HMGB1 is particularly increased in metastatic prostate cancer patients. Besides, a growing number of studies highlighted that HMGB1 could be a successful therapeutic target for prostate cancer patients. Glycyrrhizin is a novel pharmacological inhibitor of HMGB1 that may repress prostate cancer metastasis. This research was aimed to investigate the effect of glycyrrhizin on inhibition of HMGB1-induced epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a key step of tumor metastasis, in prostate cancer cells. In this study, HMGB1 knock-downed DU145 prostate cancer cells were used. Silencing the HMGB1 gene expression triggered a change of cell morphology to a more epithelial-like shape, which was accompanied by a reduction of Cdc42/GSK-3β/Snail and induction of E-cadherin levels estimated by immunoblotting. Furthermore, HMGB1 facilitated cell migration and invasion via downstream signaling, whereas HMGB1 targeting by 10 mM ethyl pyruvate effectively inhibited EMT characteristics. Interestingly, cell migration capacity induced by HMGB1 in DU145 cells was abolished in a dose-dependent effect of 25-200 μM glycyrrhizin treatment. In conclusion, glycyrrhizin successfully inhibited HMGB1-induced EMT phenomenon, which suggested that glycyrrhizin may serves as a therapeutic agent for metastatic prostate cancer.""","""['Heng-Yu Chang', 'Sheng-Yi Chen', 'Chi-Hao Wu', 'Chi-Cheng Lu', 'Gow-Chin Yen']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""J Agric Food Chem""","""['HMGB1-Induced p62 Overexpression Promotes Snail-Mediated Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition in Glioblastoma Cells via the Degradation of GSK-3β.', 'High mobility group box 1 promotes the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in prostate cancer PC3 cells via the RAGE/NF-κB signaling pathway.', 'Down-regulation of E-cadherin enhances prostate cancer chemoresistance via Notch signaling.', 'Role of epithelial mesenchymal transition in prostate tumorigenesis.', ""High-mobility group box 1 in Parkinson's disease: from pathogenesis to therapeutic approaches."", 'Anti-Cancer Potential of Phytochemicals: The Regulation of the Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition.', 'Research on the interaction of astragaloside IV and calycosin in Astragalus membranaceus with HMGB1.', 'Effects of Glycyrrhizin (GL) Supplementation on Survival, Growth Performance, Expression of Feeding-Related Genes, Activities of Digestive Enzymes, Antioxidant Capacity, and Expression of Inflammatory Factors in Large Yellow Croaker (Larimichthys crocea) Larvae.', 'Glycyrrhizic Acid Inhibits Core Fucosylation Modification Modulated EMT and Attenuates Bleomycin-Induced Pulmonary Fibrosis.', '4-Acetylantroquinonol B enhances cell death and inhibits autophagy by downregulating the PI3K/Akt/MDR1 pathway in gemcitabine-resistant pancreatic cancer cells.']"""

We screened surgical and biopsy specimens from 45 patients with PCa against a panel of sexually transmitted infection-related organisms using polymerase chain reaction and examined the severity of intraprostatic inflammation by pathologic examination. Among tested organisms, the rate of Mycoplasma genitalium (Mg) infection was significantly different between the prostate cancer cohort and benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH) cohort (P = 0.03). Mg infection in the surgical specimens was associated with younger patients. The rate of extensive disease (pT2c⁻3b) was higher in Mg-positive patients than in Mg-negative patients (P = 0.027). No significant correlation was observed between Mg infection status and the grade of intraprostatic inflammation. The detection sensitivity of biopsy specimens was 61% for Mg and 60% for human papillomavirus (HPV)18, indicating possible clinical application of this material.

Objective:   To assess the association between postdiagnosis use of low-dose aspirin and prostate cancer mortality.  Design:   Nationwide cohort study.  Setting:   Denmark.  Patients:   Men with incident prostate adenocarcinoma between 2000 and 2011.  Measurements:   Nationwide registry data on tumor characteristics, drug use, primary prostate cancer therapy, comorbidity, and socioeconomic parameters. Postdiagnosis use of low-dose aspirin (75 to 150 mg) was defined as 2 or more prescriptions filled within 1 year after prostate cancer diagnosis. Follow-up started 1 year after prostate cancer diagnosis. In secondary analyses, low-dose aspirin use was assessed within exposure periods of 5 or 7.5 years after prostate cancer diagnosis.  Results:   Of 29 136 patients (median age, 70 years), 7633 died of prostate cancer and 5575 died of other causes during a median follow-up of 4.9 years (interquartile range, 3.1 to 7.2 years), through 2015. Postdiagnosis low-dose aspirin use was associated with adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) of 0.95 (95% CI, 0.89 to 1.01) for prostate cancer-specific mortality and 1.12 (CI, 1.05 to 1.20) for other-cause mortality. The secondary analyses showed that prostate cancer mortality was slightly reduced with low-dose aspirin use after the 5-year (HR, 0.91 [CI, 0.83 to 1.01]) and 7.5-year (HR, 0.84 [CI, 0.72 to 0.97]) postdiagnosis exposure periods, notably among patients filling prescriptions for a large quantity of low-dose aspirin tablets during the 7.5-year period.  Limitations:   Data on over-the-counter aspirin use were unavailable. Some residual confounding was possible as a result of incomplete data on some prognostic factors.  Conclusion:   The study did not support an overall effect of postdiagnosis low-dose aspirin use on prostate cancer mortality. However, results for extended exposure periods suggest that low-dose aspirin use might be inversely associated with prostate cancer mortality after 5 years from cancer diagnosis.

Projecting the future burden of cancer in Canada is essential for health planning and evaluation. We aimed to estimate the future incidence of cancer in Canada to 2042.  Methods:   Age-sex-region-specific cancer incidence data were obtained for the years 1983-2012 and cancer incidence was projected from 2013 to 2042 for the top five cancer sites. The modelling algorithm combined a mixture of cancer projection methods to select the best-fitted model. When the chosen model produced by the modelling algorithm resulted in estimates that were not consistent with expert opinion, an alternate model was selected that took into consideration historical changes in policy, screening and lifestyle behaviours. Incidence projections were made for Canada and its provinces.  Results:   Lung cancer incidence is estimated to rise to 14,866 cases in men and 19,162 in women in 2042. Colorectal cancer incidence is estimated to rise to 28,146 in men and 21,102 in women. Cases of bladder cancer are projected to rise to 10,708 and 3,364 in men and women, respectively. Breast cancer incidence is predicted to rise to 40,712 and prostate cancer incidence is projected to rise to 92,949.

Unfortunately, aggressive tumors could rapidly develop into a castration resistant state. It is therefore essential to look for new molecules that are more effective, affecting not only the androgen signaling and with minimum undesirable effects. Natural products are an interesting source of new therapeutics, especially for cancer therapy as 70% of them have botanical origin. Based on an ethnobotany screening, we evaluated the effects of ethanolic extract of propolis (EEP) from Algeria on LNCaP cells. Results pointed out that EEP reduces the survival of LNCaP cells with an IC50 of 0.04 mg/ml, induces the apoptosis and blocks the cell cycle at G0/G1 phase. Interestingly, EEP decreased the accumulation of AR suggesting some anti-androgen activity. Indeed, secreted amount of the androgen target protein PSA was decreased when LNCaP cells were incubated with EEP, starting after 4 h of treatment. This anti-androgen activity was also shown on the androgen target genes Fkbp5 and Sgk1. Finally, the capacity of EEP to block AR functioning was demonstrated in transient transfections with human AR and the reporter gene ARE-tk-Luc. Propolis antagonizes the induction of the luciferase activity induced by the natural androgen DHT (10-8M) or the synthetic AR agonist R1881 (10-7M). Altogether, these results highlight the potential pharmacological effects of EEP in future treatments of prostate cancer.""","""['Nada Zabaiou', 'Allan Fouache', 'Amalia Trousson', 'Julio Buñay-Noboa', 'Geoffroy Marceau', 'Vincent Sapin', 'Amar Zellagui', 'Silvère Baron', 'Mesbah Lahouel', 'Jean-Marc A Lobaccaro']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""J Steroid Biochem Mol Biol""","""['Anticancer Activity of Propolis and Its Compounds.', 'Switch from antagonist to agonist of the androgen receptor bicalutamide is associated with prostate tumour progression in a new model system.', 'Ethanolic extract of Brazilian green propolis sensitizes prostate cancer cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis.', 'Comparison of prostate cancer cell lines for androgen receptor-mediated reporter gene assays.', 'Effects of propolis and its bioactive components on breast cancer cell pathways and the molecular mechanisms involved.', 'Molecular Basis of Prostate Cancer and Natural Products as Potential Chemotherapeutic and Chemopreventive Agents.', 'Anticancer Activity of Propolis and Its Compounds.', 'Chinese Propolis Suppressed Pancreatic Cancer Panc-1 Cells Proliferation and Migration via Hippo-YAP Pathway.', 'Modulation of Apoptosis by Plant Polysaccharides for Exerting Anti-Cancer Effects: A Review.', 'Pharmacological Modulation of Steroid Activity in Hormone-Dependent Breast and Prostate Cancers: Effect of Some Plant Extract Derivatives.']"""

Current cancer and noncancer survival models use a limited number of predefined variables, which could restrict their predictive capability. We explored a technique to create more comprehensive survival prediction models using insurance claims data from a large administrative data set. These data contain substantial information about medical diagnoses and procedures, and thus may provide a broader reflection of each patient's health.  Methods:   We identified 57,011 Medicare beneficiaries with localized prostate cancer diagnosed between 2004 and 2009. We constructed separate cancer survival and noncancer survival prediction models using a training data set and assessed performance on a test data set. Potential model inputs included clinical and demographic covariates, and 8,971 distinct insurance claim codes describing comorbid diseases, procedures, surgeries, and diagnostic tests. We used a least absolute shrinkage and selection operator technique to identify predictive variables in the final survival models. Each model's predictive capacity was compared with existing survival models with a metric of explained randomness (ρ2) ranging from 0 to 1, with 1 indicating an ideal prediction.  Results:   Our noncancer survival model included 143 covariates and had improved survival prediction (ρ2 = 0.60) compared with the Charlson comorbidity index (ρ2 = 0.26) and Elixhauser comorbidity index (ρ2 = 0.26). Our cancer-specific survival model included nine covariates, and had similar survival predictions (ρ2 = 0.71) to the Memorial Sloan Kettering prediction model (ρ2 = 0.68).  Conclusion:   Survival prediction models using high-dimensional variable selection techniques applied to claims data show promise, particularly with noncancer survival prediction.

Nomogram predictions are more precise and reproducible than clinician's estimations. The most accurate nomogram addressing 10-year life expectancy in PCa patients has not been externally validated to date. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate the performance of this nomogram in a contemporary external cohort.  Patients and methods:   For this, we enrolled all consecutive patients, who underwent radical prostatectomy at a single institution between 2005 and 2007. Age at surgery and Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) were assessed. PCa-related deaths and patients under 55 years were excluded as indicated by the nomogram. The prediction of 10-year life expectancy was calculated according to the nomogram and compared to actual survival data. Calibration and discrimination were assessed using calibration plots.  Results:   Overall, 1597 patients were evaluated, with a median age of 64 years (range 55-78 years) at surgery and a median follow-up of 134.4 months (range 0.1-161.7 months). Median CCI was 0 (range 0-10). At 10 years, 134 patients (8.4%) had died of other causes than PCa. The nomogram showed moderate discrimination capacities on receiver-operator characteristic analysis (c-index: 0.64). On calibration curves, the nomogram underestimated the actual life expectancy.  Conclusion:   The performance accuracy of this prediction model was moderate and underestimated 10-year life expectancy of contemporary PCa patients.

The long-term development of the disease increases the difficulty in separating prevalent from incident prostate cancer. The purpose of this validation study was to assess the accuracy of a claims algorithm to identify incident prostate cancer among men in commercial and Medicare Advantage US health plans.  Methods:   We identified prostate cancer in claims as a prostate cancer diagnosis within 28 days after a prostate biopsy and compared case ascertainment in the claims with the gold standard results from the Georgia Comprehensive Cancer Registry (GCCR).  Results:   We identified 74,008 men from a large health plan claims database for possible linkage with GCCR. Among the 382 prostate cancer cases identified in claims, 312 were also identified in the GCCR (positive predictive value [PPV] = 82%). Of the registry cases, 91% (95% confidence interval = 88, 94) were correctly identified in claims. Claims and registry diagnosis dates of prostate cancer matched exactly in 254/312 (81%) cases. Nearly half of the false-positive cases also had claims for prostate cancer treatment. Thirteen (43%) false-negative cases were classified as noncases by virtue of having a biopsy and diagnosis >28 days apart as required by the algorithm. Compared to matches, false-negative cases were older men with less aggressive prostate cancer.  Conclusions:   Our algorithm demonstrated a PPV of 82% with 92% sensitivity in ascertaining incident PC.

This method incorporates large volumes of visceral adipose, potentially resulting in misleading estimates of radiation dose to the SB. We evaluated the relative volume of adipose within the peritoneal space and applied this as a correction factor to standard bowel bag dosimetric measures, hypothesizing that corrected SB measures would better correlate with acute toxicity.  Methods:   Eighteen consecutive patients receiving pelvic radiation for gynaecologic cancers over a 1-year period at an academic medical centre were included. Bowel function was assessed with the Expanded Prostate Index Composite (EPIC) questionnaire. Bowel bags were contoured on simulation computed tomography (CT) scans. Adipose was auto-contoured using previously published Hounsfield Unit criteria and used to create an adipose correction factor (ACF). The ACF was applied to V45 cc and V40% volumes to create adipose corrected measures (AC-V45 cc and AC-V40%). Correlations between EPIC scores and dosimetric measures were assessed using Spearman coefficients.  Results:   V45 cc and V40% did not correlate with overall EPIC bowel domain score; however, AC-V40% did show a significant correlation (P = 0.02). Correlations of V45 cc and V40% with the bowel bother subdomain of EPIC were both significantly improved by applying the ACF (P = 0.02 for AC-V45 cc; P < 0.01 for AC-V40%).

The CSC populations were isolated and purified based on CD44+ -α2β1high surface markers in PCa cell lines LNCaP, C4-2B, 22Rv1, PC3, and DU145, and then subjected to prostasphere formation assays in the absence or presence of GSE or B2G2. Results indicated that at lower doses (<15 μg) , the GSE procyanidin mix produced activity in unsorted prostate cancer antigen (PCA) cells, but not in sorted; however, multiple treatments with low dose GSE over a course of time inhibited sphere formation by sorted PCA CSCs. Importantly, B2G2 demonstrated significant potential to target both unsorted and sorted CSCs at lower doses. As formation of spheroids, under specific in vitro conditions, is a measure of stemness, these results indicated the potential of both GSE and B2G2 to target the self-renewal of CSC in PCa cell lines, though B2G2 was more potent in its efficacy. Subsequent mechanistic studies revealed that both GSE procyanidins and B2G2 strongly decreased the constitutive as well as Jagged1 (Notch1 ligand)-induced activated Notch1 pathway.

Methods:   A secondary analysis of interviews from existing studies that explored symptom appraisal in patients who had sought help for potential symptoms of cancer. Transcripts from n = 50 in-depth interviews with patients referred with symptoms suspicious of cancer (pancreas, colorectal, oral, lung, melanoma, breast, and prostate) were re-analysed using a deductive thematic approach underpinned by the heuristics outlined in the Common Sense Model of Illness Self-regulation as set within the Model of Pathways to Treatment.  Results:   The most dominant heuristic in patient reports was the Rate of change rule (ie, symptoms that are worsening, increasing, or have a sudden onset [rather than improving, stable or decreasing in number] are more likely to indicate illness). There was also support for the Duration rule, Pattern rule, Chronology rule, Severity (of interference) rule, Age-illness rule, Novelty rule, Similarity rule, Location rule, and Optimistic bias rule. There was a lack of evidence for the Prevalence and Stress-illness rules.  Conclusions:   People do appear to use heuristics to guide their appraisal of symptoms and their perceived need for healthcare. Heuristics may be an important aspect underlying symptom misinterpretation, thus making them key targets for interventions. For instance, campaigns could tackle cognitive biases rather than focusing on specific symptom awareness.

Using cell-based transactivation assays, we demonstrate that darolutamide, its diastereomers and its main metabolite keto-darolutamide are strong, competitive antagonists for AR wild type, and also for several mutants identified in prostate cancer patients for which other AR antagonists show reduced antagonism or even agonism. Darolutamide, its two diastereomers and main metabolite are also strong antagonists in assays measuring AR N/C interaction and homodimerization. Molecular modeling suggests that the flexibility of darolutamide allows accommodation in the W742C/L mutated AR ligand-binding pocket while for enzalutamide the loss of the important hydrophobic interaction with W742 leads to reduced AR interaction. This correlates with an antagonistic pattern profile of coregulator recruitment for darolutamide. In vitro efficacy studies performed with androgen-dependent prostate cancer cell lines show that darolutamide strongly reduces cell viability and potently inhibits spheroid formation. Also, a marked down-regulation of androgen target genes paralleled by decreased AR binding to gene regulatory regions is seen. In vivo studies reveal that oral dosing of darolutamide markedly reduces growth of the LAPC-4 cell line-derived xenograft and of the KuCaP-1 patient-derived xenograft.

Although LSD1 and c-Myc are both strongly expressed in human cancers, the mechanisms by which their activities are coordinated remain unclear. We herein demonstrated that LSD1 is a direct target gene of c-Myc. The knockdown of c-Myc decreased the expression of LSD1 in several cancer cell lines. We identified two non-canonical E-boxes in the proximal promoter region of the LSD1 gene. A chromatin immunoprecipitation assay showed that c-Myc bound to these E-boxes in the LSD1 promoter. Importantly, LSD1 mRNA expression correlated with c-Myc expression in human acute myeloid leukemia (AML), glioblastoma, stomach adenocarcinoma, and prostate adenocarcinoma.

Materials and methods:   In 2017, we surveyed 915 RO and 940 URO about AS for low-risk PCa in the United States. Survey items queried respondents about their attitudes toward AS and recommendations of AS for low-risk PCa. Pearson chi-square and multivariable logistic regression identified clinical and physician factors related toward AS for low-risk PCa.  Results:   Overall, the response rate was 37.3% (n = 691) and was similar for RO and URO (35.7% vs. 38.7%; P = .18). RO were less likely to consider AS effective for low-risk PCa (86.5% vs. 92.0%; P = .04) and more likely to rate higher patient anxiety on AS (49.5% vs. 29.5%; P < .001) than URO. Recommendations of AS varied modestly on the basis of age, prostate-specific antigen (PSA), and number of cores positive for Gleason 3 + 3 PCa.

Understanding treatment patterns and associated utilization and costs may help inform stakeholders and guide decision making.  Objective:   To describe treatment patterns and health care costs in prostate cancer (PC) patients with bone metastases treated with agents approved by the FDA for mCRPC.  Methods:   2 large integrated claims databases (MarketScan and PharMetrics) were used to identify males aged ≥ 18 years who were diagnosed and treated for PC (ICD-9-CM code 185.xx or 233.4) with bone metastases (ICD-9-CM code 198.5) from June 2013 to September 2014. Patients were required to be continuously enrolled for ≥ 6 months before and after initiation of treatment with abiraterone, cabazitaxel, docetaxel, enzalutamide, mitoxantrone, radium-223, sipuleucel-T, or other chemotherapy. Study endpoints included lines of therapy, health care resource utilization per patient per month (PPPM), PPPM costs, and mortality rate. Descriptive analysis was completed for the study sample, and survival function was calculated via Kaplan-Meier estimates.  Results:   There were 953 patients meeting all inclusion criteria in the MarketScan database and 565 patients in the PharMetrics database. The median follow-up time was 18 months (interquartile range [IQR] = 14-23) for MarketScan and 14 months (IQR = 11-18) for PharMetrics. Mean age (SD) was 71 (± 10.7) and 66 (± 9.3) years, respectively. Before mCRPC treatment initiation, patients received palliative radiation therapy and bone antiresorptive therapy. For MarketScan and PharMetrics, respectively, 14.0% and 18.2% of patients received radiation therapy, 36.1% and 40.0% received denosumab; 16.5% and 16.8% received zoledronic acid; and 0.2% and 0.8% received pamidronate. Across both databases, abiraterone was the most commonly received bone metastasis treatment agent across all lines of therapy, except fourth line. Radium-223, cabazitaxel, and mitoxantrone were the least utilized therapies. The median cost PPPM during the post-index period was $10,916 (IQR=$5,334-$13,457) in MarketScan and $10,292 (IQR = $7,245-$14,699) in PharMetrics. The cost PPPM during the 6-month pre-index period was $2,643 (IQR = $850-$4,357) in MarketScan and $2,742 (IQR = $1,484-$4,730) in PharMetrics.  Conclusions:   Patients were treated mainly with abiraterone across most lines of care, with radium-223, cabazitaxel, and mitoxantrone as the least utilized therapies. Median costs PPPM increased by approximately $8,900 after initiation of FDA-approved agents for mCRPC, with the largest increase in cost stemming from oral medications.

Recently, leukemia inhibitory factor receptor (LIFR) has been found to play roles in multiple types of cancer. However, the roles of LIFR in the progression of PCa remain to be revealed. In this study, we found that LIFR plays an oncogenic role in PCa. The phosphorylation of LIFR at S1044 contributes to subsequent activation of the AKT pathway, inducing the expression of a series of proliferation and metastatic genes. Additionally, LIFR-S1044 is phosphorylated by ERK2 but not ERK1. The signal intensity of pLIFR-S1044 and pAKT S473 in PCa tissue displays a tight positive correlation.

We investigated the survival impact of prostatic urethral involvement in non-muscle-invasive patients who are not upstaged at cystectomy.  Methods:   From 2000 to 2016, 177 male patients underwent cystectomy for high-risk non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer and remained pT1, pTis, or pTa, and N0 on final pathology; 63 (35.6%) patients had prostatic urethral involvement and 114 (64.4%) did not. Prostatic involvement was non-invasive (Ta or Tis) in 56 (88.9%) patients and superficially invasive (T1) in 7 (11.1%) patients. No patient had stromal invasion. Log-rank and Cox regression analyses were used to evaluate survival.  Results:   Compared to patients without prostatic urethral involvement, patients with involvement were more likely to have received intravesical therapy (84.6% vs. 64.4%, p < 0.01), have multifocal tumor (90.8% vs. 51.7%, p < 0.01), and have positive urethral margins (7.7% vs. 0%, p < 0.01) and ureteral margins (18.5% vs. 5.1%, p < 0.01). Log-rank comparison showed inferior recurrence-free, cancer-specific, and overall survival in patients with prostatic involvement (p = 0.01, p = 0.03, p < 0.01). Patients with prostatic urethral involvement were more likely to experience recurrence in the urinary tract (p < 0.01). On Cox regression, prostatic urethral involvement was an independent predictor of overall mortality (HR = 2.08, p < 0.01).  Conclusions:   Prostatic urethral involvement is associated with inferior survival in patients who undergo cystectomy for non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer and remain pT1, pTis, or pTa on final pathology.

Studies have suggested that SPINK1 expression is associated with more aggressive disease. However, the size, follow-up, and racial diversity of prior patient cohorts have limited our understanding of SPINK1 expression in AA men. The objective was to determine the associations between SPINK1 subtype, race, and oncologic outcomes after radical prostatectomy (RP).  Methods:   A total of 186 AA and 206 EA men who underwent RP were matched according to pathologic grade. We examined SPINK1 status by immunohistochemistry on tissue microarrays using a genetically validated assay. Cox proportional hazard analyses assessed the association of SPINK1 status with oncologic outcomes in race-specific multivariate models. A second objective was to determine the correlation between CD3/CD8 T cell densities with SPINK1 status and race, using immunostaining and automated image analysis.  Results:   SPINK1-positive subtype was present in 25% (45/186) of AA and 15% (30/206) of EA men (p = 0.013). There were no differences in pathologic grade, pathologic stage, biochemical recurrence (BCR)-free survival, or metastasis-free survival between SPINK1-positive and SPINK1-negative tumors in the overall cohort or by race. In multivariate analyses, SPINK1 expression was not associated with BCR (AA: HR 0.99, 95% CI 0.56-1.75, p = 0.976; EA: HR 0.88, 95% CI 0.43-1.77, p = 0.720) or metastasis (AA: HR 0.79, 95% CI 0.25-2.49, p = 0.691; EA: HR 1.55, 95% CI 0.58-4.11, p = 0.381) in either AA or EA men. There were no significant differences in surrounding CD3/CD8 lymphocyte densities between SPINK1-positive and SPINK1-negative tumors in either race.  Conclusions:   SPINK1-positive subtype is more prevalent in AA than EA men with PCa.

In addition, LAMB3 is involved in the invasive and metastatic abilities of some types of cancer, including colon, pancreas, lung, cervix, stomach, and prostate cancer, but the role and mechanism of LAMB3 in PDAC have not been previously determined. Herein, we tentatively investigated the role of LAMB3 in the malignant biological behavior of PDAC. In this study, we demonstrated that LAMB3 is upregulated in PDAC. Inhibition of LAMB3 abrogated the tumorigenic outcomes of PI3K/Akt signaling pathway activation, including those involving cell cycle arrest, cell apoptosis, proliferation, invasion and migration in vitro, and tumor growth and liver metastasis in vivo.

However, PRLT has side effects on the salivary glands that limit the safety of the treatment. The current study aimed to show the effect of external cooling with ice packs on 177Lu-PSMA-617 uptake by the parotid glands (PGs). Methods: The study included 19 patients (mean age, 72.9 y) with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer who had been referred for the first time for 177Lu-PSMA-617 treatment and underwent pretreatment 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT. Before the initiation of PRLT, the SUVmax and SUVmean of the right and left PGs were measured on 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT. Frozen ice packs were then affixed over the right PG of each patient for approximately 5 h; 1 h after they were affixed, PRLT was administered. At 4 h after PRLT, head-and-neck SPECT/CT was performed, and at both 4 and 24 h after PRLT, whole-body planar scintigraphy was performed. Regions and volumes of interest were applied for the right and left PGs, and the counts and volumes were determined. Results: Before PRLT, 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT showed no significant difference in SUVmax or SUVmean between the right and left PGs (P > 0.05). At 4 and 24 h after PRLT, planar imaging showed no significant difference in counts between the cooled and noncooled PGs (P > 0.05). Furthermore, at 4 h after PRLT, SPECT/CT showed no significant difference in counts or volumes between the cooled and noncooled PGs (P > 0.05).

Methods: Sixteen patients (aged 53-78 y; mean age, 64.7 ± 6.5 y) with a single functioning kidney received PRLT with 177Lu-PSMA-617 between March 2015 and October 2018. All parameters of renal function (serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, and electrolytes) were prospectively documented in a structured database and analyzed before each PRLT cycle and in follow-up. Renal function was further quantified by measuring tubular extraction rate (TER) using 99mTc-mercaptoacetyltriglycine renal scintigraphy. Treatment-related adverse events were graded according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 5.0. Kaplan-Meier analysis was performed to obtain the progression-free survival and overall survival. Results: The median administered activity was 22.1 GBq (range, 15.4-33.8 GBq). The calculated absorbed radiation dose to the kidney per cycle was 5.3 ± 2.1 Gy (0.81 ± 0.32 Gy/GBq). Renal function was already impaired at baseline in 43.7% of patients, including CTCAE grade 1 renal impairment in 25.0% and CTCAE grade 2 in 18.8%. Grade 1 and 2 renal impairment, respectively, were present in 37.5% and 6.3% of the patients after the first PRLT cycle and in 31.3% and 12.5% after the second cycle. No CTCAE grade 3 or 4 nephrotoxicity was observed during or after treatment. There was no significant change in either TER or the ratio of TER to lower-limit TER after the last cycle of treatment (P > 0.05). The median PFS was 8.1 mo based on both the criteria of the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer and RECIST. The median overall survival has yet to be reached with a median follow-up time of 19.3 mo (range, 5.8-45.3 mo). Conclusion: In patients with a single functioning kidney, 177Lu-PSMA-617 PRLT is feasible, seems to be effective, and is well tolerated, without any signs of acute or subacute nephrotoxicity during a mean follow-up of nearly 2 y (and up to 45.3 mo).

BCR might be explained by target miss. Improved diagnostic accuracy provided by PET could potentially circumvent this therapeutic gap. Therefore, we evaluated consecutive 68Ga-prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) PET/CT, 11C-choline PET/CT, and standard CT imaging in the same patient with regard to TNM-stage migration and accordingly adapted curative radiotherapy options including ablative treatment of oligometastases (n ≤ 5). The cost efficacy of PET- versus CT-based treatment was also calculated. Methods: The prospective register database (064/2013BO1) was retrospectively searched for patients fulfilling the following 3 inclusion criteria: BCR after radical prostatectomy (pT2-pT4 pN0-pN1 cM0, postoperative radiotherapy allowed); 11C-choline PET/CT, 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT, and diagnostic CT performed within 24 h; and available clinical data. Ten treatment routines were defined according to current practice. Furthermore, intention-to-treat and treatment-related costs depending on the shift of TNM stage after imaging were analyzed. Eighty-three patients were eligible (median prostate-specific antigen level, 1.9 ng/mL). Results: Both PET examinations led to concordant results in 72% of patients, whereas the concordance of TNM staging between 68Ga-PSMA PET and diagnostic CT was only 36%. Incorrect staging would lead to ""wrong"" treatment and therefore to additional costs. A 68Ga-PSMA PET study would be cost-effective if additional costs do not exceed €3,844 ($4,312) (vs. CT). The number needed to image was 2 (for CT) and 4 (for 11C-choline PET) to avoid 1 incorrect treatment. In addition, 68Ga-PSMA PET staging enabled new curative options in half the patients with previous radiotherapy who otherwise receive palliative androgen deprivation therapy. Conclusion:68Ga-PSMA PET/CT is cost-effective in all patients with regard to avoidance of incorrect treatment. It enabled new curative options for patients with previous radiotherapy who are usually treated palliatively. Therefore, 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT staging should become standard for BCR after surgery with or without radiotherapy.""","""['Johannes Schwenck', 'Susann-Cathrin Olthof', 'Christina Pfannenberg', 'Gerald Reischl', 'Daniel Wegener', 'Jolanta Marzec', 'Jens Bedke', 'Arnulf Stenzl', 'Konstantin Nikolaou', 'Christian la Fougère', 'Daniel Zips', 'Arndt-Christian Müller']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""J Nucl Med""","""['68Ga-PSMA-PET/CT-directed IGRT/SBRT for oligometastases of recurrent prostate cancer after initial surgery.', 'More advantages in detecting bone and soft tissue metastases from prostate cancer using 18F-PSMA PET/CT.', '68Ga-Labeled Prostate-specific Membrane Antigen Ligand Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography for Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.', 'Use of gallium-68 prostate-specific membrane antigen positron-emission tomography for detecting lymph node metastases in primary and recurrent prostate cancer and location of recurrence after radical prostatectomy: an overview of the current literature.', 'Bridging the Imaging Gap: PSMA PET/CT Has a High Impact on Treatment Planning in Prostate Cancer Patients with Biochemical Recurrence-A Narrative Review of the Literature.', 'Combining PSA and PET features to select candidates for salvage lymph node dissection in recurrent prostate cancer.', 'Dose-Escalated Salvage Radiotherapy for Macroscopic Local Recurrence of Prostate Cancer in the Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen Positron Emission Tomography Era.', 'Cost-effectiveness of the implementation of 68GaGa-PSMA-11 PET/CT at initial prostate cancer staging.', 'Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen (PSMA) Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography (PET/CT) for the Primary Staging of Prostate Cancer in Australia.', 'Feasibility and Optimal Time Point of 68GaGallium-labeled Prostate-specific Membrane Antigen Ligand Positron Emission Tomography Imaging in Patients Undergoing Cytoreductive Surgery After Systemic Therapy for Primary Oligometastatic Prostate Cancer: Implications for Patient Selection and Extent of Surgery.']"""

The objective of this study was to assess simplified methods for quantifying 18F-FDHT uptake in mCRPC patients and to assess effects of tumor perfusion on these 18F-FDHT uptake metrics. Methods: Seventeen mCRPC patients were included in this prospective observational multicenter study. Test and retest 30-min dynamic 18F-FDHT PET/CT scans with venous blood sampling were performed in 14 patients. In addition, arterial blood sampling and dynamic 15O-H2O scans were obtained in a subset of 6 patients. Several simplified methods were assessed: Patlak plots; SUV normalized to body weight (SUVBW), lean body mass (SUVLBM), whole blood (SUVWB), parent plasma activity concentration (SUVPP), area under the parent plasma curve (SUVAUC,PP), and area under the whole-blood input curve (SUVAUC,WB); and SUVBW corrected for sex hormone-binding globulin levels (SUVSHBG). Results were correlated with parameters derived from full pharmacokinetic 18F-FDHT and 15O-H2O. Finally, the repeatability of individual quantitative uptake metrics was assessed. Results: Eighty-seven 18F-FDHT-avid lesions were evaluated. 18F-FDHT uptake was best described by an irreversible 2-tissue-compartment model. Replacing the continuous metabolite-corrected arterial plasma input function with an image-derived input function in combination with venous sample data provided similar Ki results (R2 = 0.98). Patlak Ki and SUVAUC,PP showed an excellent correlation (R2 > 0.9). SUVBW showed a moderate correlation to Ki (R2 = 0.70, presumably due to fast 18F-FDHT metabolism. When calculating SUVSHBG, correlation to Ki improved (R2 = 0.88). The repeatability of full kinetic modeling parameters was inferior to that of simplified methods (repeatability coefficients > 36% vs. < 28%, respectively). 18F-FDHT uptake showed minimal blood flow dependency. Conclusion:18F-FDHT kinetics in mCRPC patients are best described by an irreversible 2-tissue-compartment model with blood volume parameter. SUVAUC,PP showed a near-perfect correlation with the irreversible 2-tissue-compartment model analysis and can be used for accurate quantification of 18F-FDHT uptake in whole-body PET/CT scans.

Research has not demonstrated that non-statin lipid-lowering medications (NSLLMs) provide a similar benefit, which would support a cholesterol-based mechanism. We sought to rigorously test the hypothesis that cholesterol-lowering drugs affect PC incidence and severity.  Methods:   A retrospective cohort study was conducted by abstracting prescription and health service records for 249,986 Saskatchewan men aged ≥40 years between January 1, 1990 and December 31, 2014 and comparing first-time statin and NSLLM users with age-matched non-users and glaucoma medication (GM) users for PC incidence, metastases at diagnosis and PC mortality using Cox proportional hazards regression.  Results:   In comparing statin users to non-users, a weak association was detected with increased PC incidence (hazard ratio [HR] 1.07, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.02-1.12) that disappeared when compared with GM users. Substantial protective associations were observed between statin use and metastatic PC and PC mortality (HRs 0.69, 95% CI: 0.61-0.79 and 0.73, 95% CI: 0.66-0.81, respectively), which were stronger when compared with GM use (HRs 0.52, 95% CI: 0.40-0.68 and 0.51, 95% CI: 0.41-0.63, respectively). Similar associations were found for NSLLM versus GM for metastatic PC (HR 0.57, 95% CI: 0.41-0.79) and PC mortality (HR 0.66, 95% CI: 0.51-0.85).

Methods:   The data of 1846 male patients between 45 and 75 years of age was evaluated. The patients were subdivided into groups according to age, blood prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels prostate volume (PV), digital rectal examination (DRE) findings, and pathology results. The tumour detection rates in the 12-quadrant biopsies were compared with PV, PSA levels, and DRE results of the grouped patients.  Results:   The tumour detection rate decreased with increasing PV in patients 45-75 years of age and with a PSA level ≤ 14.5. No decrease was detected in patients 45-60 years of age or those aged 61-75 years with a PSA ≤ 6.99 and suspicious DRE findings. A decrease in the tumour detection rate with increasing PV was observed in the other three subgroups of patients in this age group, who had a PSA ≤ 6.99, and normal DRE findings but a PV ≤ 40, PV 41-80, or PV ≥ 81.  Conclusions:   Even though there is no statistically significant relationship between PV and the prostate cancer detection rate in patients 45-60 years of age, the cancer detection rate decreased with increasing PV in three of the four subgroups of patients between the ages of 61 and 75 years.

Methods:   Using nationwide Medicare claims from 2011 to 2014, we identified radiation episodes for bone metastasis from prostate, lung, and breast cancer. Details regarding fractionation, radiation therapy (RT) modality, and sociodemographic characteristics were abstracted from claims. Time trends in use of 10 or fewer RT fractions per episode were evaluated using the Cochran-Armitage test. Total cost per episode was calculated from a payer's perspective and reported in 2017 dollars; time trends in cost were assessed using linear regression. Generalized linear models identified predictors of treatment with 10 or fewer fractions.  Results:   Of 51,533 episodes identified, 46,326 used 2D/3D RT, 3,199 used intensity-modulated RT, and 2,008 used stereotactic body RT. The proportion of 2D/3D RT episodes using 10 or fewer fractions increased from 65.5% to 79.7% ( Ptrend < .001), and mean total cost per episode decreased from $6,742 to $6,067 ( Ptrend < .001). Use of single-fraction radiation increased modestly for 2D/3D treatment (6.5% to 8.1%; Ptrend < .001). Predictors of 10 or fewer fractions included treatment in recent years, advanced age (≥ 85 years), and higher comorbidity score. Variation was noted based on geographic region and primary cancer.  Conclusion:   During a period with quality initiatives launched by the American Society for Radiation Oncology, American Board of Internal Medicine, and National Quality Forum, use of 10 or fewer fractions for bone metastasis increased by 14.2%, but single-fraction regimens increased by only 1.6%, highlighting opportunities for quality improvement.""","""['Jennifer K Logan', 'Jing Jiang', 'Ya-Chen Tina Shih', 'Xiudong Lei', 'Ying Xu', 'Karen E Hoffman', 'Sharon H Giordano', 'Benjamin D Smith']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""J Oncol Pract""","""['Trends in Radiation Therapy for Bone Metastases, 2015 to 2017: Choosing Wisely in the Era of Complex Radiation.', 'Trends in Radiation Fractionation for Bone Metastases: A Contemporary Nationwide Analysis.', 'Choosing Wisely at the End of Life: Use of Shorter Courses of Palliative Radiation Therapy for Bone Metastasis.', 'Meta-analysis of dose-fractionation radiotherapy trials for the palliation of painful bone metastases.', 'Intensity-modulated radiotherapy for the treatment of prostate cancer: a systematic review and economic evaluation.', 'Factors Affecting Survival and Local Control in Patients with Bone Metastases Treated with Radiotherapy.', 'Prostate cancer induced bone pain: pathobiology, current treatments and pain responses from recent clinical trials.', 'Trends in Radiation Oncology Treatment Fractionation at a Single Academic Center, 2010 to 2020.', 'Reduction of oesophageal toxicity with VMAT dose-sparing radiotherapy in thoracic metastatic spinal cord compression: A feasibility study.', 'Evaluation of Patient-Reported Outcome Differences by Radiotherapy Techniques for Bone Metastases in A Population-Based Healthcare System.']"""

Solubility is a key factor controlling dissolution, and it is recognized that, within the intestinal tract, this is influenced by the luminal fluid pH, amphiphile content, and composition. Various simulated intestinal fluid recipes have been introduced to mimic this behavior and studied using a range of different experimental techniques. In this article, we have measured equilibrium solubility utilizing a novel four component mixture design (4CMD) with biorelevant amphiphiles (bile salt, phospholipid, oleate, and monoglyceride) within a matrix of three pH values (5, 6, and 7) and total amphiphile concentrations (11.7, 30.6, and 77.5 mM) to provide a topographical and statistical overview. Three poorly soluble drugs representing acidic (indomethacin), basic (carvedilol), and neutral (fenofibrate) categories have been studied. The macroscopic solubility behavior agrees with literature and exhibits an overall increasing solubility from low pH and total amphiphile concentration to high pH and total amphiphile concentration. Within the matrix, all three drugs display different topographies, which can be related to the statistical effect levels of the individual amphiphiles or amphiphile interactions on solubility. The study also identifies previously unreported three and four way factor interactions notably between bile salt, phospholipid, pH, and total amphiphile concentration. In addition, the results also reveal that solubility variability is linked to the number of amphiphiles and the respective ratios in the measurement fluid, with the minimum variation present in systems containing all four amphiphiles. The individual 4CMD experiments within the matrix can be linked to provide a possible intestinal solubility window for each drug that could be applied in PBPK modeling systems. Overall the approach provides a novel overview of intestinal solubility topography along with greater detail on the impact of the various factors studied; however, each matrix requires 351 individual solubility measurements. Further studies will be required to refine the experimental protocol in order the maximize information garnered while minimizing the number of measurements required.""","""['Claire Dunn', 'Jeremy Perrier', 'Ibrahim Khadra', 'Clive G Wilson', 'Gavin W Halbert']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Mol Pharm""","""['Influence of Physiological Gastrointestinal Surfactant Ratio on the Equilibrium Solubility of BCS Class II Drugs Investigated Using a Four Component Mixture Design.', 'Statistical investigation of simulated fed intestinal media composition on the equilibrium solubility of oral drugs.', 'Small scale design of experiment investigation of equilibrium solubility in simulated fasted and fed intestinal fluid.', 'A review of drug solubility in human intestinal fluids: implications for the prediction of oral absorption.', 'Composition and physicochemical properties of fasted-state human duodenal and jejunal fluid: a critical evaluation of the available data.', 'Integration of Biorelevant Pediatric Dissolution Methodology into PBPK Modeling to Predict In Vivo Performance and Bioequivalence of Generic Drugs in Pediatric Populations: a Carbamazepine Case Study.', 'Fasted intestinal solubility limits and distributions applied to the biopharmaceutics and developability classification systems.', 'Impact of Simulated Intestinal Fluids on Dissolution, Solution Chemistry, and Membrane Transport of Amorphous Multidrug Formulations.', 'Supersaturation and Solubilization upon In Vitro Digestion of Fenofibrate Type I Lipid Formulations: Effect of Droplet Size, Surfactant Concentration and Lipid Type.', 'Small scale in vitro method to determine a bioequivalent equilibrium solubility range for fasted human intestinal fluid.']"""

Dyskerin encoded by the DKC1 gene is associated with the formation of certain small RNAs and the telomerase activity. Inherited mutations in DKC1 inactivate the dyskerin and causes dyskeratosis congenital, which is characterized by skin defects, hematopoiesis failure, and increased susceptibility to cancer. DKC1 reportedly up-regulates in several human cancers, including renal cell carcinoma and prostate cancer. Dyskerin is deregulated in B-chronic lymphocytic leukemia and breast carcinomas, but its expression and function in glioma have hardly been investigated. Hence, we were prompted to collect tissue samples and implement cell experiments. Our study reveals that DKC1 expression is significantly increased in the pathological tissues of glioma compared with that in normal tissues. The increased staining of DKC1 is related to the World Health Organization stages of tumors. DKC1 knockdown also significantly inhibits glioma cell growth by altering the expression of cell cycle-relative molecules to arrest at the G1 phase. In the transwell chamber, DKC1 knockdown glioma cells exhibit low motility. Consistent with classic oncogenic pathways, N-cadherin, HIF-1α, and MMP2 expression levels are lower compared with those of the control group. Therefore, DKC1 up-regulation in gliomas is common and necessary for extensive tumor growth. The phenotype of glioma cell lines after DKC1 down-regulation suggests its use as a valuable clinical treatment strategy.""","""['Fa-An Miao#', 'Kun Chu#', 'Hai-Rong Chen#', 'Meng Zhang', 'Pei-Cong Shi', 'Jin Bai', 'Yong-Ping You']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Invest New Drugs""","""['Author Correction: Increased DKC1 expression in glioma and its significance in tumor cell proliferation, migration and invasion.', 'DKC1 overexpression associated with prostate cancer progression.', 'DKC1 serves as a potential prognostic biomarker for human clear cell renal cell carcinoma and promotes its proliferation, migration and invasion via the NF‑κB pathway.', 'BRG1 expression is increased in human glioma and controls glioma cell proliferation, migration and invasion in vitro.', 'Severity of X-linked dyskeratosis congenita (DKCX) cellular defects is not directly related to dyskerin (DKC1) activity in ribosomal RNA biogenesis or mRNA translation.', 'Dyskeratosis congenita.', 'miRNA326-5p Targets DKC1 Gene to Regulate Apoptosis-Related Proteins and Intervene in the Development of Neuroblastoma.', ""Decoding the 'Fifth' Nucleotide: Impact of RNA Pseudouridylation on Gene Expression and Human Disease."", 'Novel sights on therapeutic, prognostic, and diagnostics aspects of non-coding RNAs in glioblastoma multiforme.', 'The importance of pseudouridylation: human disorders related to the fifth nucleoside.', 'Understanding the Epitranscriptome for Avant-Garde Brain Tumour Diagnostics.']"""

Methods:   This single-center, retrospective study included 72 nonconsecutive men with prostate cancer who underwent MRI before radical prostatectomy performed between April 2014 and August 2017 and whose MRI registered lesions were microdissected from radical prostatectomy specimens and then profiled using Decipher (89 lesions; 23 MRI invisible [PI-RADS v2 scores ≤ 2] and 66 MRI visible [PI-RADS v2 scores ≥ 3]). Linear regression analysis was used to assess clinicopathologic and MRI predictors of Decipher results; correlation coefficients (r) were used to quantify these associations. AUC was used to determine whether PI-RADS v2 could accurately distinguish between low-risk (Decipher score < 0.45) and intermediate-/high-risk (Decipher score ≥ 0.45) lesions.  Results:   MRI-visible lesions had higher Decipher scores than MRI-invisible lesions (mean difference 0.22; 95% CI 0.13, 0.32; p < 0.0001); most MRI-invisible lesions (82.6%) were low risk. PI-RADS v2 had moderate correlation with Decipher (r = 0.54) and had higher accuracy (AUC 0.863) than prostate cancer grade groups (AUC 0.780) in peripheral zone lesions (95% CI for difference 0.01, 0.15; p = 0.018).  Conclusions:   MRI phenotypes of prostate cancer are positively correlated with Decipher risk groups. Although PI-RADS v2 can accurately distinguish between lesions classified by Decipher as low or intermediate/high risk, some lesions classified as intermediate/high risk by Decipher are invisible on MRI.

In prostate cancer, specifically, the anti-tumor activity of BET bromodomain inhibition has been principally linked to suppression of androgen receptor (AR) function. MYC is a well-described BRD4 target gene in multiple cancer types, and prior work demonstrates that MYC plays an important role in promoting prostate cancer cell survival. Importantly, several BET bromodomain clinical trials are ongoing, including in prostate cancer. However, there is limited information about pharmacodynamic markers of response or mediators of de novo resistance. Using a panel of prostate cancer cell lines, we demonstrated that MYC suppression-rather than AR suppression-is a key determinant of BET bromodomain inhibitor sensitivity. Importantly, we determined that BRD4 was dispensable for MYC expression in the most resistant cell lines and that MYC RNAi + BET bromodomain inhibition led to additive anti-tumor activity in the most resistant cell lines. Our findings demonstrate that MYC suppression is an important pharmacodynamic marker of BET bromodomain inhibitor response and suggest that targeting MYC may be a promising therapeutic strategy to overcome de novo BET bromodomain inhibitor resistance in prostate cancer.""","""['Daniel J Coleman', 'Lina Gao', 'Jacob Schwartzman', 'James E Korkola', 'David Sampson', 'Daniel S Derrick', 'Joshua Urrutia', 'Ariel Balter', 'Julja Burchard', 'Carly J King', 'Kami E Chiotti', 'Laura M Heiser', 'Joshi J Alumkal']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Sci Rep""","""['BET bromodomain inhibition blocks the function of a critical AR-independent master regulator network in lethal prostate cancer.', 'BET bromodomain inhibitors--a novel epigenetic approach in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Androgen receptor promotes ligand-independent prostate cancer progression through c-Myc upregulation.', 'DUB3 Promotes BET Inhibitor Resistance and Cancer Progression by Deubiquitinating BRD4.', 'BET inhibitors in metastatic prostate cancer: therapeutic implications and rational drug combinations.', 'Integrated high-throughput analysis identifies super enhancers in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'BET Bromodomain Inhibitors: Novel Design Strategies and Therapeutic Applications.', 'Simultaneous administration of EZH2 and BET inhibitors inhibits proliferation and clonogenic ability of metastatic prostate cancer cells.', 'Neuropilin-2 regulates androgen-receptor transcriptional activity in advanced prostate cancer.', 'Transcription Factors as Novel Therapeutic Targets and Drivers of Prostate Cancer Progression.']"""

Objectives:   To determine if atherosclerosis of penile arteries plays a role in erectile dysfunction (ED), this study analyzed NaF images in prostate cancer patients.  Methods:   NaF positron emission tomography-computed tomography bone scans were evaluated in 437 prostate cancer patients (age 66.6 ± 8.7 years). Their urologic histories were reviewed for prevalent ED (diagnosed before the scan date) or incident ED (no ED at first scan, but developed during 1-year follow-up); patients with no ED (neither before the scan nor during follow-up) were included as a control group. A semicircular region of interest was set on the dorsal one-half of the penis (to avoid residual excreted activity in the urethra) on 5 contiguous slices at the base of the penis on positron emission tomography-computed tomography coronal reconstructions, and the average standardized uptake value (SUVmax) was described as NaF uptake.  Results:   Of 437 patients, 336 (76.9%) had prevalent ED, 60 incident ED (13.7%), and 41 had no ED (9.4%). SUVmax in patients with prevalent (median 1.88; interquartile range [IQR]: 1.67 to 2.16) or incident (median 1.86; IQR: 1.72 to 2.08) ED was significantly higher than no ED (median 1.42; IQR: 1.25 to 1.54) patients (p < 0.001). After adjustment for other risk factors, the odds ratio of prevalent or incident ED was 25.2 (95% confidence interval: 9.5 to 67.0) for every 0.5-U increment in SUVmax with receptor operating characteristic area of 0.91 (95% confidence interval: 0.88 to 0.94).

Patients were selected on the basis of prior pelvic radiotherapy (n = 16; 12 for previous PCa), or contra indication/refusal of surgery or radiotherapy. Complications, local progression-free survival (LPFS) and overall survival (OS) were retrospectively investigated.  Results:   Eighteen [60%] patients reported procedure-related complications: 5/18 [28%] needed surgical/interventional treatments and 13 [72%] conservative or pharmacological treatment.

Our goal was to build on evidence contributing to improving outcomes in prostate cancer care. Semi-structured interviews were designed to elicit explanation and meaning. 15 men (10 metropolitan, 5 regional) not diagnosed with prostate cancer were recruited through widely-distributed flyers in medical and community settings. Interviews were recorded and transcribed; transcripts were analysed thematically. Five main themes were identified, four of which were prompted by the questions: Addressing prostate health, Experiences with and expectations of GPs, Differences in care between regional and metropolitan areas, and Achieving early diagnosis. The fifth theme arose spontaneously: Australian masculinity. Men identified as problematic the limited availability of GPs in regional areas, the lack of consistency in approaches to prostate cancer detection, and men's reluctance to seek medical care.

However, existing progressive sampling based volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) algorithm is ineffective for DLMLC, requiring more arcs to achieve dosimetry comparable to VMAT plans with higher resolution single-layer MLC (SLMLC). In this study, we develop a novel single-arc VMAT optimization framework to take advantage of the unique DLMLC characteristics fully. Direct aperture optimization (DAO) for single-arc DLMLC VMAT was formulated as a least square dose fidelity objective, along with an anisotropic total variation term to regulate the fluence smoothness and a single segment term for forming simple apertures. The DAO was solved through alternating optimization approach. The DLMLC deliverability constraint and the MLC leaf speed constraint were formulated as the optimization constraints and solved using a graph optimization algorithm. Feasibility of the proposed framework was tested on a brain, a lung, and a prostate cancer patient. The framework was further adapted for a simultaneous integrated boost (SIB) case. The single-arc DLMLC-10 mm (leaf width) plan was compared against single-arc SLMLC VMAT plans including SLMLC-5mm, SLMLC-10mm, and SLMLC with 10 mm leaf width and 5 mm leaf step size (SLMLC-10mm-5mm). Compared with the SLMLC-10mm plan and the SLMLC-10mm-5mm plan, with the same target coverage, the DLMLC-10 mm plan reduced R50 by 30.7% and 10.0%, the average max OAR dose by 5.79% and 3.7% of the prescription dose, and the average mean OAR dose by 4.18% and 2.1% of the prescription dose, respectively. The plan quality is comparable to that of the SLMLC-5mm plan. The novel single-arc VMAT optimization framework for DLMLC utilizes two MLC layers to improve the effective modulation resolution and afford more sophisticated modulation. Consequently, DLMLC VMAT achieves superior dosimetry to SLMLC VMAT with the same leaf width.""","""['Qihui Lyu', 'Ryan Neph', 'Victoria Y Yu', 'Dan Ruan', 'Ke Sheng']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Phys Med Biol""","""['ROAD: ROtational direct Aperture optimization with a Decoupled ring-collimator for FLASH radiotherapy.', 'VMAT optimization with dynamic collimator rotation.', 'A comprehensive formulation for volumetric modulated arc therapy planning.', 'A novel optimization framework for VMAT with dynamic gantry couch rotation.', 'Texture analysis on the fluence map to evaluate the degree of modulation for volumetric modulated arc therapy.', 'Investigation of Halcyon multi-leaf collimator model in Eclipse treatment planning system: A focus on the VMAT dose calculation with the Acuros XB algorithm.', 'ROAD: ROtational direct Aperture optimization with a Decoupled ring-collimator for FLASH radiotherapy.', 'Many-isocenter optimization for robotic radiotherapy.']"""

Methods:   Multiple overlapped slices are acquired and Fourier transformed in the slice-select direction. The slice profile is incorporated into a Tikhonov-regularized reconstruction. Through-plane resolution is tested in a resolution phantom. An anthropomorphic prostate phantom is used to study the SNR, and results are compared with theoretical prediction.

Results:   The modulation transfer function (MTF) plots of the resolution phantom show good modulation at frequency 0.5 lp/mm, demonstrating 1 mm through-plane resolution restoration. The SNR measurements experimentally match the theoretically predicted values. The radiological evaluation shows that the proposed method is superior to the reference method for five criteria of sharpness but inferior with respect to artifacts.  Conclusions:   In conjunction with overlapped slices a k Z -space-based reconstruction approach can be used to improve through-plane resolution in multislice T2SE MRI. 1 mm resolution is demonstrated from 3.2 mm thick slices.

Objectives:   To provide an overview and investigate the temporal pattern of hospitalizations for medically verified incident somatic disease in adult survivors compared with cancer-free comparison people, taking into consideration pretreatment comorbidity and the socioeconomic position of the participants.  Design, setting, and participants:   In this nationwide, population-based cohort-cohort study, 458 646 survivors of the 12 most frequent first primary cancers listed in the Danish Cancer Registry between January 1, 1997, and December 31, 2014, and 2 121 567 matched cancer-free comparison people were identified from the Danish Central Population Registry. Hospitalizations for somatic diseases after cancer diagnosis or study entry were identified from the National Patient Register and stratified according to the 11 main diagnostic groups in the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision. A cohort of cancer survivors was formed for each combination of cancer type and diagnostic group, with a corresponding group of cancer-free people, resulting in 132 unique cohorts. Data analysis was performed from September 1, 2017, to January 15, 2018.  Main outcomes and measures:   Risk of hospitalization and the temporal pattern of incidence were analyzed in Cox proportional hazards regression models. Cumulative incidence proportions were calculated by the pseudo-observation method.  Results:   A total of 2 580 213 people were investigated, of whom 458 646 were cancer survivors (mean [SD] age, 69 [11.6] years; 230 793 [50.3%] male and 227 853 [49.7%] female) and 2 121 567 were comparison people (mean [SD] age, 69 [11.5] years; 1 054 465 [49.7%] male and 1 067 102 [50.3%] female). More cancer survivors vs comparison people had comorbid conditions at the time of cancer diagnosis or study entry (Charlson Comorbidity Index ≥1: 19% vs 13%). Overall, the risk of hospitalizations for somatic diseases was significantly higher for cancer survivors in almost all diagnostic groups (eg, diseases in the nervous system among breast cancer survivors: hazard ratio, 1.20; 95% CI, 1.17-1.22; diseases in the respiratory system in lung cancer survivors: hazard ratio, 5.85; 95% CI, 5.63-6.07; and diseases in blood and blood-forming organs in prostate cancer survivors: hazard ratio, 2.60; 95% CI, 2.50-2.71).  Conclusions and relevance:   The findings suggest that adult survivors of the 12 most common cancers are at significantly higher risk for a broad range of somatic diseases that require hospitalization compared with matched cancer-free comparison people. The results of this study suggest the importance of close, targeted monitoring for new somatic disease during follow-up care of cancer survivors.""","""['Trille Kristina Kjaer', 'Elisabeth Anne Wreford Andersen', 'Jeanette Falck Winther', 'Pernille Envold Bidstrup', 'Michael Borre', 'Henrik Møller', 'Signe Benzon Larsen', 'Christoffer Johansen', 'Susanne Oksbjerg Dalton']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""JAMA Oncol""","""['Affiliation Added.', 'Health burden in cancer survivors: below the tip of the iceberg.', 'Long-term Risk of Hospitalization for Somatic Diseases in Survivors of Adolescent or Young Adult Cancer.', 'Endocrine Late Effects in Survivors of Cancer in Adolescence and Young Adulthood: A Danish Population-Based Cohort Study.', 'Psychiatric disorders in childhood cancer survivors in Denmark, Finland, and Sweden: a register-based cohort study from the SALiCCS research programme.', 'Parenthood among men diagnosed with cancer in childhood and early adulthood: trends over time in a Danish national cohort.', 'Mortality and morbidity in patients with osteogenesis imperfecta in Denmark.', 'Educational differences in healthcare use among survivors after breast, prostate, lung, and colon cancer - a SEQUEL cohort study.', 'Home-built environment interventions and inflammation biomarkers: a systematic review and meta-analysis protocol.', 'Increased morbidity evaluated on hospital contacts and prescriptions among 100,834 Danish breast cancer survivors.', 'Chronic comorbid conditions among adult cancer survivors in the United States: Results from the National Health Interview Survey, 2002-2018.', ""The Interplay between Housing Environmental Attributes and Design Exposures and Psychoneuroimmunology Profile-An Exploratory Review and Analysis Paper in the Cancer Survivors' Mental Health Morbidity Context.""]"""

Despite this risk, many cancer survivors continue to smoke cigarettes. This article describes the relationship between smoking behavior and demographic and clinical factors in cancer survivors.  Methods:   Multinomial logistic regression of cross-sectional data from the Health Information National Trends Survey was conducted using combined data from years 2003, 2005, 2007, 2011, 2012, 2013, and 2014. Independent variables included age, cancer history, race, education level, marital status, insurance status, and data year; the dependent variable was smoking status (current vs. former or never).  Results:   Cancer survivors were less likely to be current smokers but more likely to be former smokers than those with no history of cancer. Cancer survivors that currently smoked were more likely to have lower education levels, be divorced, separated, or single, or not have health insurance. Older cancer survivors, Hispanic, and non-Hispanic black survivors were less likely to smoke. Among cancer subgroups, prostate cancer survivors had the lowest rate (8.8%) of current smoking from 2011 to 2014, and cervical cancer survivors had the highest rate (31.1%).  Conclusions:   Although those with no history of cancer had higher rates of current smoking, many subgroups of cancer survivors continued to smoke at higher rates than average cancer survivors. Cancer survivors that were younger, had lower education levels, were any marital status other than married or widowed, were uninsured, or survived cervical cancer were more likely to be smokers than other survivors.  Implications:   It is important to understand which types of cancer survivors are at high risk of continued smoking to better inform tobacco dependence treatment interventions among those at high risk of cancer reoccurrence. Our findings suggest targeted tobacco dependence treatment efforts among cancer survivors should focus on survivors of cervical cancer and survivors that are young, unmarried, uninsured, or have lower education levels.""","""['Christine M Swoboda', 'Daniel M Walker', 'Timothy R Huerta']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Nicotine Tob Res""","""['Correlates of smoking status in cancer survivors.', 'Smoking cessation attitudes and practices among cancer survivors - United States, 2015.', 'Use of Electronic Cigarettes Among Cancer Survivors in the U.S.', 'Prevalence and correlates of smoking and cessation-related behavior among survivors of ten cancers: findings from a nationwide survey nine years after diagnosis.', 'Tobacco use and cessation for cancer survivors: an overview for clinicians.', 'Enhancing long-term smoking abstinence among individuals with a history of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia or cervical cancer (Project ACCESS): protocol for a randomized clinical trial.', 'Provision of smoking cessation support for patients following a diagnosis of cancer in Ireland.', 'Supporting Smokers in Difficult Settings: Suggestions for Better Education and Counseling in Cancer Centers in Jordan.', 'The impact of hyperbaric oxygen therapy on late irradiation injury in oral microcirculation.', 'Affordable Care Act Medicaid expansion and access to primary-care based smoking cessation assistance among cancer survivors: an observational cohort study.']"""

Serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) is at present the most commonly used biomarker for PCa screening, as well as a reliable marker of disease recurrence after initial treatment. Bone metastases (BM) are present in advanced stages of the disease. Imaging of BM is important not only for localization and characterization, but also to evaluate their size and number, as well as to follow-up the disease during and after therapy. Bone metastases formation is triggered by cancer initiating cells in the bone marrow and is facilitated by the release of several growth factors. Although BM from PCa are very heterogenic, the majority of them are described as ""osteoblastic"", while pure ""osteolytic"" metastases are very rare. The PSA levels, along with other parameters, may determine the risk of having BM. A classification report, which is currently in use, divides patients into three categories according to the risk of having BM: low risk (PSA<10ng/mL, clinical stage T1-T2a, Gleason Score ≤6), intermediate risk (PSA 10.1-20ng/mL, clinical stage T2b-T2c, Gleason Score=7) and high risk (PSA>20ng/mL, clinical stage T3a or higher, or Gleason Score ≥8). Even though PSA remains the only biomarker of this disease in clinical practice, it is not always analogue with the severity of the disease and should be evaluated along with the clinical and diagnostic imaging findings. Detection of BM is not always easy, as there may be unexpected sites and occult metastases. The clinical importance of revealing BM in patients with PCa is to determine the overall survival of the patients and their quality of life, as BM may lead to high morbidity and mortality. There are many options of treating BM, such as chemotherapy, immunotherapy, external beam radiotherapy, bone modifying agents and recently prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) targeted therapies. Another potential therapy is radioguided surgery, in patients with occult and/or focally recurrent PCa. Such a single occult metastasis causing very high levels of PSA has been presented using technetium-99m (99m Tc) labeled PSMA imaging. Diagnosis and staging of PCa mostly relies on the morphology of imaging, using computerized tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography/CT (PET/CT) using fluorine-18-fluorodeoxyglucose (18 F-FDG). The radiopharmaceuticals used in Nuclear Medicine for BM in PCa are: a) those that target lesions, such as 99m Tc-phosphonates, 18 F-sodium fluoride (18 F-NaF) and b) those that target the cancer cells, such as 18 F or carbon-11 (11 C)-choline, 18 F-FDG and 18 F or gallium-68 (68 Ga)-PSMA. Bone scan with 99mTc-phosphonates is widely used for the evaluation of bone metabolism in patients with PCa. It is a low cost, widely available radiopharmaceutical having the advantage of a whole body evaluation. Planar and single photon emission tomography (SPET) may also be applied. The sensitivity of the whole body scan (WBS) ranges from 75%-95%, while the specificity is lower, ranging from 60%-75% due to false positive findings in benign conditions (arthritis, inflammation etc) who also have increased bone metabolism. Sensitivity and specificity however, perform better (96% and 94% respectively) when SPET and SPET/CT techniques are applied. Of course, bone marrow metastases cannot be detected in a WBS. The PSA marker is used to predict the pre-test probability of BM and in case of a bone scan several retrospective analyses showed that PSA levels <20ng/mL can exclude with high probability a positive WBS, with a high negative predictive value (almost 99%). The European Association of Urology (EAU) guidelines state that a bone scan can be omitted in patients with PSA levels <20ng/mL and with a Gleason Score ≤7. Imaging with 18 F-NaF PET/CT is characterized by high and rapid bone uptake, minimal serum protein binding and rapid blood clearance which lead to a fast and high target to background ratio with a short acquisition time (30 minutes). Sensitivity and specificity for the detection of BM in high risk PCa patients is almost 100%. The main advantages provided by 18 F-NaF PET/CT are the better imaging quality along with a whole body acquisition and the fusion technique. Fluorine-18-choline and 11 C-choline PET/CT came to practice lately, reflecting the cell membrane metabolism. Choline is an essential component of phospholipids and is trapped in the cells after a phosphorylation by a choline kinase. The sensitivity and specificity of 18 F-choline PET/CT for detecting BM in patients with PCa is reported to be 79% and 97% respectively. However, the performance of choline PET/CT seems to be dependent of the levels of the PSA, in cases of biochemical recurrence and reaches about 75%% in those PCa patients with PSA levels >3ng/mL, with a poor performance when the PSA level is low. Fluorine-18-FDG is the most commonly used radiotracer in PET/CT, however has a little value in staging and restaging of PCa. Because of its low sensitivity 18 F-FDG is trapped in cancer cells through the activation of the glycolytic pathways and in case of BM is an index of increased glucose metabolism in PCa cells rather than in bone lesion per se. Osteolytic lesions show more increased metabolic activity than the osteoblastic lesions and are better revealed with 18F-FDG. Therefore, 18 F-FDG PET/CT is suggested to be performed only in selected patients with PCa, those with most aggressive tumors and high Gleason score. Fluorine-18-PSMA PET/CT The need of a more sensitive and specific agent has been evident. Prostate specific monoclonal antibody (PSMA) is a folate hydrolase cell surface glycoprotein. It is mainly expressed in four tissues of the body, including prostate epithelium, the proximal tubules of the kidney, the jejunal brush border of the small intestine and ganglia of the nervous system. So consequently may in some cases be expressed in cancers other than PCa and also in benign processes. It is localized in the cytoplasm and the apical side of the prostate epithelium that lines prostatic ducts. In case of malignant transformation, PSMA is transferred from the cytoplasm to the luminal surface of the prostatic ducts and thus becomes membrane bound. It has a unique three-parts structure, an external portion, a transmembrane portion and an internal-cytoplasmatic portion. Prostate specific monoclonal antibody is also upregulated and thus overexpressed in most PCa, but weakly expressed in normal prostatic tissue. Imaging by PSMA PET/CT has been shown to detect sites of disease recurrence at lower PSA levels than conventional imaging. The PSMA overexpression is even present when the cell becomes castrate-resistant and that is the reason why it is the most favorable target for PET imaging. Prostate cancer expresses 100 to 1000 times more PSMA than normal tissue and is increasing even more in higher grade tumors as well as in increased castrate resistance. Therefore, PSMA represents an excellent target for both diagnostic imaging and endoradiotherapy of PCa. For diagnostic purposes PSMA ligands, mainly small-molecule inhibitors, are most commonly labeled either with 68 Ga or 18 F. The 18 F-PSMA-1007 (((3S,10S,14S)-1-(4-(((S)-4-carboxy-2-((S)-4-carboxy-2-(6-18 F-fluoronicotinamido) butanamido) methyl phenyl)-3- (naphthalen-2-ylmethyl)-1,4,12-trioxo-2,5,11,13-tetraazahexadecane- 10,14,16-tricarboxylic acid)) seems to be more favorable among other 18 F-PSMA ligands candidate compounds because it demonstrates high labeling yields, better tumor uptake and non-urinary background clearance. On the contrary, 68 Ga-PSMA is rapidly excreted via the urinary tract resulting in intense accumulation in the bladder, thus, obscuring the prostate. Compared to 68 Ga, 18 F has many advantages such as it is produced in larger amounts, it has a longer half life and a higher physical spatial resolution. The short half-life of 68 Ga relative to 18 F (68 vs. 110 min) makes 68 Ga-PSMA inconvenient for longer transport, so that it is almost mandatory to use local gallium generators, which have a higher cost and lower yields at the end of their first half-life. Each generator provides only one or two elutions per day and it requires separate syntheses at different times of the day in a local radiopharmacy. Furthermore, the resolution of 68 Ga-labeled tracers is physically limited because of positron range effects. In contrast, 18 F labels avoid these intrinsic difficulties and can be produced at high yields in central cyclotrons. Fluorine-18-PSMA-1007 has been recently used by us in the Nuclear Medicine Department of ""Evangelismos"" general hospital of Athens and our experience so far showed favorable results, with high image resolution acquisitions and lesions which showed PSMA avidity. Fluorine-18-PSMA-1007 PET/CT imaging was carried out with a dual phase protocol, consisting of two separate scans. One (early scan) at 60min post injection starting from the diaphragm to the middle of the thighs and the late scan at 180min from the dome of the skull to the knee joints. Patients were asked to urine before the examination. Images were acquired with a scan time of 3min per bed position on a General Electric PET/CT system and the image reconstruction was performed by the standard software method provided by the manufacturer. A low dose CT scan, without a contrast agent, was performed before the PET scan in order to be used for the attenuation correction. Administered activities were calculated based on the department's protocols with a suggested injected activity of 4MBq/kg. Any areas of focally increased radiotracer uptake, at both the early and late PET scans, were considered as abnormal, despite the presence or absence of morphological changes of the CT scan. The normal distribution of the radiotracer was taken under consideration, which includes mainly the liver and the gallbladder, as it has hepatobiliary clearance rather than renal, the spleen, the pancreas, the submandibular, sublingual, lacrimal and parotid glands, the kidneys, the urinary bladder and the small intestine. The maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) was calculated for each lesion. A typical case of a 78 years man with PCa having PSA 7,3ng/mL and also having Paget's disease was tested by the above procedure for initial staging. The 18 F-PSMA-1007 PET/CT imaging revealed diffusely increased radiotracer uptake in the bones of the pelvis with a SUVmax 9. The CT imaging of the pelvis was consistent with Paget's disease, with diffuse mixed osteosclerotic and osteolytic lesions, accompanied with bone expansion. The primary PCa was also revealed with focally increased radiotracer uptake in the left prostatic lobe with a SUVmax 19, as well as a second small focus of pathologically increased PSMA uptake in the right prostatic lobe with a SUVmax 23. Another patient 79 years old, with PCa was studied with 18 F-choline PET/CT which showed diffuse bone metastasis in the pelvis. He had PSA level, 412ng/mL. The 18 F-PSMA-1007 PET/CT imaging showed multiple foci of increased radiotracer uptake throughout the whole skeleton, including the skull, both humerus and femoral bones with indicative SUVmax 26. Computed tomography showed rather similar BM. There were also lymph nodes metastases at the left internal mammary chain as well as the left inguinal areas, with a SUVmax 25. The first case indicated that 18 F-PSMA PET/CT could easily differentiate PCa BM from Paget's disease, however benign conditions such as Paget's disease may also show PSMA uptake and the second case that 18 F-PSMA PET/CT scan was more sensitive than the 18 F-choline PET/CT scan, with high quality images. According to other authors the SUVmax value of BM in PCa was 16.57±23.59 using the 18 F-PSMA PET/CT scan. This imaging modality in accordance to other authors is better than 68 Ga-labelled PSMA-ligands and can better differentiate BM from healing fractures. Very recently a novel PET radiopharmaceutical has been approved both in USA and Europe: 18 F-fluciclovine (trans-1-amino-3-[18 F] fluoro-cyclobutane carboxylic acid). Fluorine-18-fluciclovine is a synthetic amino acid that is transported by multiple sodium-dependent and sodium-independent channels found to be upregulated in PCa cells. The main indication of use includes the detection and localization of PCa recurrence in patients with a rising PSA following prior therapy. The main advantages of 18 F-fluciclovine are the low urinary excretion, which allows for better evaluation of prostate bed and the low uptake in inflammatory cells (e.g. macrophages). There are no studies in the literature comparing 18 F-PSMA to 18 F-fluciclovine, however two studies comparing 18 F-fluciclovine to 68 Ga-PSMA, showed better performance for 68 Ga-PSMA in PCa patients with biochemical recurrence. So, 18 F-PSMA-1007 PET/CT imaging seems to be very promising in staging and restaging patients with PCa, especially when biochemical relapse is under consideration. Although it seems to perform better than other imaging modalities like bone scan, 18 F-FDG PET/CT or 18 F-choline PET/CT, its high cost and low availability must be considered. Further large studies need to be conducted in order to evaluate the accuracy and the predictive values of this method, emphasizing on bone metastases.""","""['Nikoletta K Pianou', 'Petros Z Stavrou', 'Evangelia Vlontzou', 'Phivi Rondogianni', 'Demetrios N Exarhos', 'Ioannis E Datseris']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Hell J Nucl Med""","""['Intraindividual Comparison of 18F-PSMA-1007 and 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT in the Prospective Evaluation of Patients with Newly Diagnosed Prostate Carcinoma: A Pilot Study.', '68Ga-Labeled Prostate-specific Membrane Antigen Ligand Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography for Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.', 'Comparison of 68GaGa-PSMA-11 PET/CT with 18FNaF PET/CT in the evaluation of bone metastases in metastatic prostate cancer patients prior to radionuclide therapy.', 'New Clinical Indications for (18)F/(11)C-choline, New Tracers for Positron Emission Tomography and a Promising Hybrid Device for Prostate Cancer Staging: A Systematic Review of the Literature.', '18F-NaF-PET/CT and 99mTc-MDP Bone Scintigraphy in the Detection of Bone Metastases in Prostate Cancer.', 'Radiomics‑Clinical model based on 99mTc-MDP SPECT/CT for distinguishing between bone metastasis and benign bone disease in tumor patients.', 'The Impact of PSMA PET/CT on Modern Prostate Cancer Management and Decision Making-The Urological Perspective.', 'Recurrent Facial Paralysis-an Unusual Initial Presentation of Temporal Bone Metastasis in Case of Advanced Prostate Malignancy.', 'Recurrent Prostate Cancer Diagnostics with 18F-PSMA-1007 PET/CT: A Systematic Review of the Current State.', 'Efficacy, Safety, and Challenges of CAR T-Cells in the Treatment of Solid Tumors.']"""

There is a paucity of information regarding the learning curve for fusion biopsies. We aim to study the amount of experience needed to be both accurate and time-efficient in this procedure.  Methods:   We prospectively collected data on all MRI-US fusion biopsies performed from April 2014 to August 2017. We used two parameters to define the learning curve. Process Measurement (efficiency) was measured by time from the beginning of anesthesia to end of procedure. Outcome Measurement (accuracy) was measured by cancer detection rate for PI-RAD 3 lesions. The end of the learning curve was defined graphically and mathematically. We performed a separate analysis for transrectal and transperineal biopsies.  Results:   We completed 779 fusion biopsies (523 transrectal, 256 transperineal). Patients median age was 66 years (IQR 61-70) and median PSA 6.95 ng/ml (IQR 4.2-10.6). Prostate cancer was diagnosed in 385 (49%). Process Measurement-Procedure time decreased from 45 min in the first transrectal fusion biopsy to 15 min after 109 biopsies and remained stable (p < 0.0001). Time decreased from 55 min in the first transperineal biopsy to 18 min after 124 biopsies (p < 0.0001). Outcome Measurement-In transrectal fusion-biopsies detection rate for PI-RADS 3 lesions increased from 35 to 50% after 104 biopsies. In transperineal fusion-biopsies, detection rate increased from 40 to 55% after 119 cases for PI-RADS 3 lesions.

We demonstrate that mda-7/IL-24, administered through a replication incompetent type 5 adenovirus (Ad.mda-7) or with His-MDA-7/IL-24 protein, down-regulates DICER, a critical regulator in miRNA processing. This effect is specific for mature miR-221, as it does not affect Pri-miR-221 expression, and the DICER protein, as no changes occur in other miRNA processing cofactors, including DROSHA, PASHA, or Argonaute. DICER is unchanged by Ad.mda-7/IL-24 in normal immortal prostate cells, whereas Ad.mda-7 down-regulates DICER in multiple cancer cells including glioblastoma multiforme and prostate, breast, lung, and liver carcinoma cells. MDA-7/IL-24 protein down-regulates DICER expression through canonical IL-20/IL-22 receptors. Gain- and loss-of-function studies confirm that overexpression of DICER rescues deregulation of miRNAs by mda-7/IL-24, partially rescuing cancer cells from mda-7/IL-24-mediated cell death. Stable overexpression of DICER in cancer cells impedes Ad.mda-7 or His-MDA-7/IL-24 inhibition of cell growth, colony formation, PARP cleavage, and apoptosis. In addition, stable overexpression of DICER renders cancer cells more resistant to Ad.mda-7 inhibition of primary and secondary tumor growth. MDA-7/IL-24-mediated regulation of DICER is reactive oxygen species-dependent and mediated by melanogenesis-associated transcription factor.

Although the NIR fluorescently labeled glucose analog glucosamine (cypate-glucosamine) has applications in preclinical imaging, the transport pathways and fate of this probe in tissues remain unaddressed. Here, we have synthesized and characterized cypate and cypate-glucosamine conjugate (cy-2-glu), and investigated the probable transport pathways of these probes in vitro and in vivo. We compared uptake of the probes in the presence and absence of excess d-glucose, ""saturated cypate"" and palmitic acid in two normal-cancer cell line pairs: lung cancer (A549)-normal (MRC9) and prostate cancer (DU145)-normal (BPH). Breast cancer (MDA-MB-231) and liver cancer (HepG2) cell lines were also examined. Results support use of the glucose transport pathway by cy-2-glu and fatty acid transport pathway by cypate. Mass spectrometry data on the in vitro extracts revealed deamidation of cy-2-glu in prostate and liver cells, suggesting release of glucosamine. In vivo biodistribution studies in mice engrafted with breast tumors showed a distinct accumulation of cy-2-glu in liver and tumors, and to a lesser extent in kidneys and spleen. A negligible accumulation of cypate alone in tumors was observed. Analysis of urine extracts revealed renal excretion of the cy-2-glu probe in the form of free cypate, indicating deamidation of cy-2-glu in tissues. Thus, investigation of the metabolic pathways used by NIR probes such as cy-2-glu advances their use in the detection and monitoring of tumor progression in preclinical animal studies.""","""['Mona Doshi', 'Daniel A Nierenberg', 'Orielyz Flores-Fernandez', 'Pragney Deme', 'Edilu Becerra', 'Annette R Khaled', 'Sampath Parthasarathy']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Mol Pharmacol""","""['Glucosamine-linked near-infrared fluorescent probes for imaging of solid tumor xenografts.', 'Comparison of near-infrared fluorescent deoxyglucose probes with different dyes for tumor diagnosis in vivo.', 'cypate-d: -(+)-glucosamine (cyp-GlcN), and d: -(+)-glucosamine-cypate-d: -(+)-glucosamine (cyp-2GlcN).', 'Fast clearing RGD-based near-infrared fluorescent probes for in vivo tumor diagnosis.', 'Advances and perspectives in near-infrared fluorescent organic probes for surgical oncology.', 'Potential of Photodynamic Therapy Based on Sugar-Conjugated Photosensitizers.']"""

Patients and methods:   This study included 437 consecutive mCSPC patients whose primary androgen deprivation therapy was judged to have failed. Prognostic outcomes in these patients were investigated by dividing them into the following 4 groups of 82, 104, 133 and 118 patients with TTCR 0-6, 6.1-12, 12.1-18 and ≥18.1 months, respectively.  Results:   The mean value of TTCR in the 437 patients was 18.7 months. Of several baseline parameters, significant differences among the 4 groups were noted in the performance status, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) level and Gleason score, all of which favored longer TTCR groups. Furthermore, despite the lack of a significant difference in time from the development of castration-resistant disease to death among the 4 groups, there was a significant difference in overall survival (OS) from diagnosis among these groups, showing prolonged OS proportional to TTCR. Univariate analysis identified the age, PSA level, LDH level, ALP level, Gleason score, visceral metastasis and TTCR as significant predictors of OS, of which only age, ALP level and TTCR were shown to be independently associated with OS on multivariate analysis.

Methods:   A case-cohort study within the Melbourne Collaborative Cohort Study included 547 colorectal, 634 breast, and 824 prostate cancers, and a sex-stratified random sample of participants (n = 2,996). Concentration of 25(OH)D in baseline-dried blood spots was measured using LC-MS/MS.

Previous epidemiologic evidence on the potential link is conflicting. This study aimed to assess whether an association between finasteride use and male breast cancer exists after accounting for potential confounders.  Methods:   The source population consisted of all men (≥35 years) from Denmark (1995-2014), Finland (1997-2013), and Sweden (2005-2014). Cases with incident male breast cancer were identified in the cancer registries and matched with 50 density-sampled, age, and country-matched male population controls per case. Exposure information on finasteride use was derived from the prescription registries. Potential confounders were identified using the directed acyclic graph methodology and measured by use of information from nation-wide registries.  Results:   The study population comprised 1,005 male breast cancer cases and 43,058 controls. Confounder-adjusted odds of finasteride exposure were not statistically significantly increased [OR, 1.09; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.77-1.54] in breast cancer cases relative to controls.

Methods:   The expression of PKD, mast cells and microvessel density were examined by IHC. The clinical significance was determined by statistical analyses. The biological function of PKD and the underlying mechanisms were investigated using in vitro and in vivo models.  Results:   PKD2/3 contributed to MCs recruitment and tumor angiogenesis in the prostate cancer microenvironment. Clinical data showed that increased activation of PKD at Ser744/748 in prostate cancer was correlated with mast cell infiltration and microvascular density. PKD2/3 silencing of prostate cancer cells markedly decreased MCs migration and tube formation of HUVEC cells. Moreover, PKD2/3 depletion not only reduced SCF, CCL5 and CCL11 expression in prostate cancer cells but also inhibited angiogenic factors in MCs. Conversely, exogenous SCF, CCL5 and CCL11 reversed the effect on MCs migration inhibited by PKD2/3 silencing. Mechanistically, PKD2/3 interacted with Erk1/2 and activated Erk1/2 or NF-κB signaling pathway, leading to AP-1 or NF-κB binding to the promoter of scf, ccl5 and ccl11. Finally, PKD-specific inhibitor significantly reduced tumor volume and tumor growth in mice bearing RM-1 prostate cancer cells, which was attributed to attenuation of mast cell recruitment and tumor angiogenesis.  Conclusions:   These results demonstrate a novel PKDs function that contributes to tumor angiogenesis and progression through mast cells recruitment in prostate cancer microenvironment.""","""['Wanfu Xu', 'Jiabi Qian', 'Fangyin Zeng', 'Songyu Li', 'Wenjing Guo', 'Liping Chen', 'Guihuan Li', 'Zhishuai Zhang', 'Qiming Jane Wang', 'Fan Deng']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""J Exp Clin Cancer Res""","""['PKD2 and PKD3 promote prostate cancer cell invasion by modulating NF-κB- and HDAC1-mediated expression and activation of uPA.', 'CCL5-dependent mast cell infiltration into the tumor microenvironment in clear cell renal cell carcinoma patients.', 'Hyperactivated FRS2α-mediated signaling in prostate cancer cells promotes tumor angiogenesis and predicts poor clinical outcome of patients.', 'Mast cells and angiogenesis in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.', 'Possible biological and translational significance of mast cells density in colorectal cancer.', 'Vitronectin Destroyed Intestinal Epithelial Cell Differentiation through Activation of PDE4-Mediated Ferroptosis in Inflammatory Bowel Disease.', 'Inhibition of DAMP actions in the tumoral microenvironment using lactoferrin-glycyrrhizin conjugate for glioblastoma therapy.', 'Potential role for protein kinase D inhibitors in prostate cancer.', 'Impact of Immune Cells in the Tumor Microenvironment of Prostate Cancer Metastasis.', 'Protein Kinase D3 (PKD3) Requires Hsp90 for Stability and Promotion of Prostate Cancer Cell Migration.']"""

Methods: A retrospective analysis of 309 patients (aging (65±6) years) who were experienced laparoscopic radical prostatectomy from January 2010 to December 2016 at the Department of Urology, First Affiliated Hospital of Fujian Medical University. According to the relationship between prostate apex and membrane urethra at the mid-sagittal plane of preoperative MRI, all patients were classified into 4 categories. There were 31 patients for type 1, apex covering both anterior and posterior aspects of membranous urethra, 139 patients for type 2, apex covering anterior side of membranous urethra, 63 patients for type 3, apex covering posterior aspect of membranous urethra, 76 patients for type 4, apex not covering membranous urethra. PAM and BCR after operation were compared between this four groups respectively. The χ(2) test was used to compare PAM among the 4 types. Logistic regression analysis were undertaken to analyze the factors affecting PAM. Cox's proportional hazards regression model was undertaken to identify the variables influencing BCR. Results: There was no significant difference in the 4 groups concerning age, body mass index, prostate volume, preoperative prostate-specific antigen (PSA) value, postoperative Gleason score and pathological stage (P>0.05).The median follow-up time was 32 months (ranged from 12 to 60 months).The data showed that the apical type 3 patients has the highest PAM. There was statistical difference among the 4 groups in PAM (χ(2)=15.592, P=0.001).

Hypericum perforatum (H. Perforatum) extract (HPE) administration provides remarkable decrease of PCa development. H. perforatum contains 7 conserved miRNAs (Hyp-miR-156a, Hyp-miR-156b, Hyp-miR-166, Hyp-miR-390, Hyp-miR-394, Hyp-miR-396 and Hyp-miR-414) with different targets. In this study, we aimed to investigate cross-kingdom gene regulation via miRNAs of H. perforatum flower dietetically absorbed in manner of an in silico approach to define potential biomarkers for PCa. psRNATarget database was used to find human genes targeted by 7 pre-defined H. perforatum miRNAs. We defined the mostly affected gene families from these miRNAs as ZNF, TMEM, SLC and FAM gene families. GeneMANIA database was used to define the most affected genes (TMEM41B and SLC4A7) from these 7 miRNAs. cBioPortal database was used to define alteration frequencies of TMEM41B and SLC4A7 on different types of PCa and to measure the mutual interaction potency and significance of co-occurence in PCa. This analysis showed that neuroendocrine prostate cancer (NEPC) had the highest total mutation frequency (22%) of TMEM41B and SLC4A7 genes. Also, TMEM41B and SLC4A7 genes had an average 2.1% pathway change potential among all different types of PCa. Moreover, TMEM41B and SLC4A7 gene pair was found significantly co-occurrent in PCa (p < 0.001). Finally, via GEPIA database, we used Spearman correlation analysis to measure the correlation degree of TMEM41B and SLC4A7 genes in PCa and found their significant correlation with PCa (p = 1.2 × 10-12, R = 0.28). All in all, it was proved in silico and supported with previously known clinical data that SLC4A7 and TMEM41B potentially have a significant and critical tumor suppressive role for PCa, and show this effect combinatorily working together.

Methods:   This work involved prostate only patients, planned with 79.2 Gy in 44 fractions to the planning target volume (PTV). Femoral heads, bladder, and rectum were considered organs at risk. This study was performed in two parts. For each of the 25 patients in Part 1, two single-energy single-arc plans, a 6 MV-SA plan and a 15 MV-SA plan, and a third MEPA plan involving composite of 6-MV anterior-posterior partial arcs and a 15-MV lateral partial arc weighted 1:2 were created. The dosimetric difference between MEPA(6/15 MV 1:2 weighted) and 6 MV-SA plans, and MEPA(6/15 MV 1:2 weighted) and 15 MV-SA plans were measured. In the Part 2 of this study, a second MEPAs plan (6 MV anterior-posterior arcs and 15 MV lateral arcs weighted 1:1), (MEPA 6/15 MV 1:1 weighted), was generated for 15 patients and compared only with two single-energy partial arcs plans, a 6 and a 15 MV-PA, to investigate the influence of the energy only. Dosimetric parameters of each structure, total monitor-units (MUs), homogeneity index (HI), and conformity number (CN) were analyzed.  Results:   In Part 1, no statistically significant differences were observed for mean dose to PTV and CN for MEPAs (6/15 MV 1:2 weighted) vs 6 and 15 MV-SA. MEPAs (6/15 MV 1:2 weighted) increased HI compared to 6 and 15 MV-SA (P < 0.0005; P < 0.0005). MEPAs (6/15 MV 1:2 weighted) produced significantly lower mean doses to rectum, bladder, and MUs/fraction, but higher mean doses to femoral heads, compared to 6 MV-SA (P < 0.0005) and 15 MV-SA (P < 0.0005). The results of Part 2 of this study showed that, in comparison to 6 and 15 MV-PA, MEPAs (6/15 MV 1:1 weighted) plans significantly improved CNs (P < 0.0005; P < 0.0005) and produced significantly lower mean doses to the rectum and bladder (P < 0.0005; P < 0.0005). While mean doses to the PTV and femoral heads of MEPAs (6/15 MV 1:1 weighted) plans were statistically comparable to 6 MV-PA (P > 0.05), MEPAs (6/15 MV 1:1 weighted) increased mean doses to left (P = 0.04) and right (P = 0.04) femoral heads compared to 15 MV-PA. MEPAs (6/15 MV 1:1 weighted) resulted in significantly lower total MUs compared to 6 MV-PA (P < 0.0005) and 15 MV-PA (P = 0.04).  Conclusion:   The study for prostate radiotherapy demonstrated that a choice of MEPAs for VMAT has the potential to minimize doses to OARs and improve dose conformity to PTV, at the expense of a moderate increase in mean dose to the femoral heads.""","""['Shadab Momin', 'James L Gräfe', 'Rao F Khan']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""J Appl Clin Med Phys""","""['Dosimetric study of uniform scanning proton therapy planning for prostate cancer patients with a metal hip prosthesis, and comparison with volumetric-modulated arc therapy.', 'Treatment planning comparison of IMPT, VMAT and 4π radiotherapy for prostate cases.', 'Feasibility of the partial-single arc technique in RapidArc planning for prostate cancer treatment.', 'Volumetric-modulated arc therapy for the treatment of a large planning target volume in thoracic esophageal cancer.', 'Robust optimization in lung treatment plans accounting for geometric uncertainty.', 'Does radiation therapy need more than two photon energies from Linac?']"""

The coordination of molecular cascades, including cell proliferation and apoptosis, are fundamental to this process. The intrinsic apoptosis pathway appears to be important in the early phases of ductal cavitation and luminisation; however, the role of the extrinsic apoptosis pathway has still to be determined. Questions remain as to whether the latter mechanism participates in the maintenance of the ductal lumen; therefore, the present study investigated the expression of proteins Prostate apoptosis response-4 (Par-4), Fas cell surface death receptor (Fas), Fas ligand (FasL), pleckstrin homology-like domain family A member 1 (PHLDA1), caspase-3, B-cell CLL/lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2), survivin, Ki-67, mucin 1 (MUC1), and secreted protein acidic and cysteine-rich (SPARC) during distinct phases of human SG development (50 specimens). This strategy aimed to draw an immunomorphological map of the proteins involved in apoptosis, cell proliferation, and tissue maturation during the SG branching morphogenesis process. Par-4 was positive at all stages except the pre-acinar phase. Fas and FasL were expressed in few cells. PHLDA1 was expressed in all phases but not in the terminal bud. Bcl-2 expression was mainly negative (expressed in few cells). Survivin showed a cytoplasmic expression pattern in the early phases of development, which changed to a predominantly nuclear expression during development into more differentiated structures. Ki-67 was expressed mainly at the pseudoglandular stage. MUC1 was positive in the pseudoglandular stage with a cytoplasmic pattern in regions of early luminal opening. Immunostaining for SPARC and caspase-3 was negative.

However, existing prognostic models are inadequate-often using treatment outcomes rather than survival, stratifying by broad heterogeneous groups and using heavily treated cohorts. To address this unmet need, we developed an individualised prognostic model that contextualises PCa-specific mortality (PCSM) against other cause mortality, and estimates the impact of treatment on survival.  Methods and findings:   Using records from the United Kingdom National Cancer Registration and Analysis Service (NCRAS), data were collated for 10,089 men diagnosed with nonmetastatic PCa between 2000 and 2010 in Eastern England. Median follow-up was 9.8 years with 3,829 deaths (1,202 PCa specific). Totals of 19.8%, 14.1%, 34.6%, and 31.5% of men underwent conservative management, prostatectomy, radiotherapy (RT), and androgen deprivation monotherapy, respectively. A total of 2,546 men diagnosed in Singapore over a similar time period represented an external validation cohort. Data were randomly split 70:30 into model development and validation cohorts. Fifteen-year PCSM and non-PCa mortality (NPCM) were explored using separate multivariable Cox models within a competing risks framework. Fractional polynomials (FPs) were utilised to fit continuous variables and baseline hazards. Model accuracy was assessed by discrimination and calibration using the Harrell C-index and chi-squared goodness of fit, respectively, within both validation cohorts. A multivariable model estimating individualised 10- and 15-year survival outcomes was constructed combining age, prostate-specific antigen (PSA), histological grade, biopsy core involvement, stage, and primary treatment, which were each independent prognostic factors for PCSM, and age and comorbidity, which were prognostic for NPCM. The model demonstrated good discrimination, with a C-index of 0.84 (95% CI: 0.82-0.86) and 0.84 (95% CI: 0.80-0.87) for 15-year PCSM in the UK and Singapore validation cohorts, respectively, comparing favourably to international risk-stratification criteria. Discrimination was maintained for overall mortality, with C-index 0.77 (95% CI: 0.75-0.78) and 0.76 (95% CI: 0.73-0.78). The model was well calibrated with no significant difference between predicted and observed PCa-specific (p = 0.19) or overall deaths (p = 0.43) in the UK cohort. Key study limitations were a relatively small external validation cohort, an inability to account for delayed changes to treatment beyond 12 months, and an absence of tumour-stage subclassifications.  Conclusions:   'PREDICT Prostate' is an individualised multivariable PCa prognostic model built from baseline diagnostic information and the first to our knowledge that models potential treatment benefits on overall survival.

For the intervention group, mean scores at 24 months improved by 0.44 (SE, 0.06; P < .001) from baseline. This improvement was 0.5 standard deviation, which was clinically significant. The proportion reporting satisfaction with decision and no regret increased over time and was higher for the intervention group, compared with the usual care group at 24 months (P < .05). Among low-risk patients, a higher proportion of the intervention group was receiving active surveillance, compared with the usual care group (P < .001).  Conclusion:   Our patient-centered PreProCare intervention improved satisfaction with care, satisfaction with decision, reduced regrets, and aligned treatment choice with risk category. The majority of our participants had a high income, with implications for generalizability. Additional studies can evaluate the effectiveness of PreProCare as a mechanism for improving clinical and patient-reported outcomes in different settings.""","""['Ravishankar Jayadevappa', 'Sumedha Chhatre', 'Joseph J Gallo', 'Marsha Wittink', 'Knashawn H Morales', 'David I Lee', 'Thomas J Guzzo', 'Neha Vapiwala', 'Yu-Ning Wong', 'Diane K Newman', 'Keith Van Arsdalen', 'S Bruce Malkowicz', 'J Sanford Schwartz', 'Alan J Wein']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""J Clin Oncol""","""['Prostate cancer tool may help patients to decide on treatment.', 'Reply to A.

We sought to characterize the content of conversations on Twitter about kidney cancer and the participants engaged in these dialogues.  Methods:   This qualitative study analyzed the content of 2,097 tweets that contained the key words kidney cancer from August 1 to 22, 2017. Tweets were categorized by content domain of conversations related to kidney cancer on Twitter and user types of participants in these dialogues.  Results:   Among the 2,097 kidney cancer-related tweets analyzed, 858 (41.4%) were authored by individuals, 865 (41.2%) by organizations, and 364 (17.4%) by media sites. The most common content discussed was support (29.3%) and treatment (26.5%). Among the 2,097 tweets, 825 were unique tweets, and 1,272 were retweets. The most common unique tweets were about clinical trials (23.9%), most often authored by media sites. The most common retweets were about treatment (38.5%), most often authored by organizations.  Conclusion:   Twitter dialogues about kidney cancer are most commonly related to support and treatment.

The aim of the present study was to investigate the prognostic value of CXCL4L1 in PCa. In total, 213 PCa patients treated with radical prostatectomy were enrolled and peripheral blood samples of all patients were collected. Expression of serum CXCL4L1 in patients with different tumor stages and grades were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The Kaplan-Meier method was applied to estimate the progression to castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), metastasis, biochemical recurrence (BCR)-free survival, and overall survival (OS). Prognostic factors for BCR-free survival and OS were determined by univariate and multivariate analyses using the Cox proportional hazards regression model. The expression of CXCL4L1 was significantly lower in PCa patients with advanced pathological tumor stage, high-grade Gleason score, and metastasis. Moreover, downregulation of CXCL4L1 not only strongly correlated with aggressive clinicopathological features, but also predicted tumor progression and unfavorable outcomes. Finally, multivariate Cox regression analyses identified CXCL4L1 as an independent prognostic factor for both BCR-free survival (hazard ratio [HR]: 2.03, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.26-3.27; P = 0.004) and OS (HR: 2.26, 95% CI: 1.07-4.79; P = 0.033).

Rapid biochemical recurrence (BCR) is considered as a sign for clinical recurrence metastasis and PCa-specific mortality. Hence, the aim of the present study was to identify a lncRNA signature that can predict BCR of PCa accurately. Bioinformatics analysis, Kaplan-Meier analyses, Cox regression analyses, and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) were performed in a publicly available database with 499 PCa tissues and 52 matched normal tissues. A signature was identified. All these lncRNAs were differentially expressed between tumor and normal tissues and differentially expressed between high Gleason score and low Gleason score tissues. Furthermore, we developed a seven lncRNAs signature that can predict PCa BCR. Patients classified into low-risk group showed better BCR survival significantly than the patients in the high-risk group (hazard ratio = 0.32, 95% CI: 0.20-0.52, concordance index = 0.63). The area under the curve was 0.68 for BCR. The signature also had good discrimination for BCR in men with Gleason 7 PCa. In conclusion, our results suggest that the seven lncRNAs signature is a new biomarker of BCR and high risk in PCa. In addition, the individual lncRNA warrants further study to uncover the associated mechanisms of PCa progression and the signature could be used to design direct clinical trials for adjuvant therapy.""","""['Ning Shao', 'Yao Zhu', 'Fang-Ning Wan', 'Ding-Wei Ye']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Asian J Androl""","""['A potential panel of four-long noncoding RNA signature in prostate cancer predicts biochemical recurrence-free survival and disease-free survival.', 'Six-long non-coding RNA signature predicts recurrence-free survival in hepatocellular carcinoma.', 'A novel seven-lncRNA signature for prognosis prediction in hepatocellular carcinoma.', 'Clinical prospects of long noncoding RNAs as novel biomarkers and therapeutic targets in prostate cancer.', 'The evolution of long noncoding RNA acceptance in prostate cancer initiation, progression, and its clinical utility in disease management.', 'A Five Glutamine-Associated Signature Predicts Prognosis of Prostate Cancer and Links Glutamine Metabolism with Tumor Microenvironment.', 'The Development of a Gleason Score-Related Gene Signature for Predicting the Prognosis of Prostate Cancer.', 'Mutator-Derived lncRNA Landscape: A Novel Insight Into the Genomic Instability of Prostate Cancer.', 'LncRNA ubiquitin-binding protein domain protein 10 antisense RNA 1 inhibits colon adenocarcinoma progression via the miR-515-5p/slit guidance ligand 3 axis.', 'Should androgen deprivation therapy and other systemic treatments be used in men with prostate cancer and a rising PSA post-local treatments?']"""

When LAPC4 cells engineered to express miR-34a were injected into mice, we did not observe changes in tumor growth or CD44 expression; however, unexpectedly miR-34a expression was lost in vivo. In the original study, LAPC4 cells expressing miR-34a had a statistically significant reduction in tumor regeneration and reduced CD44 expression compared to control (Figure 4A and Supplemental Figures 4A,B and 5C; Liu et al., 2011). Furthermore, when we tested if miR-34a regulated CD44 through binding sites in the 3'UTR we did not find a statistically significant difference, whereas the original study reported miR-34a decreased CD44 expression that was partially abrogated by mutation of the binding sites in the CD44 3'UTR (Figure 4D; Liu et al., 2011).

Our early detection efforts led to the identification of elevated levels of antiapoptotic protein, c-FLIP and its upstream regulatory factors such as androgen receptor (AR), recepteur d'origine nantais (RON), a receptor tyrosine kinase in human prostate tumors. The primary objective of this study was to explore whether these markers play a role in racial disparities using immunohistochemistry in prostatectomy samples from a cohort of AA, Hispanic Whites (HWs), and non-Hispanic Whites (NHWs). Bivariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses were used to identify a statistical association between molecular markers, possible correlation with risk factors including race, obesity, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and disease aggressiveness. Further, changes in the levels and expression of these molecular markers were also evaluated using human PCa cell lines. We found significantly elevated levels of RON ( P = 0.0082), AR ( P = 0.0001), c-FLIP ( P = 0.0071) in AAs compared with HWs or NHWs. Furthermore, a higher proportion of HW and NHWs had a high Gleason score (>6) but not PSA as compared to AAs ( P = 0.032). In summary, our findings suggest that PSA was important in predicting aggressive disease for the cohort overall; however, high levels of RON may play a role in predisposing AA men to develop aggressive disease. Future research is needed using large datasets to confirm these findings and to explore whether all or any of these markers could aid in race-specific stratification of patients for treatment.""","""['Roble G Bedolla', 'Dimpy P Shah', 'Shih-Bo Huang', 'Robert L Reddick', 'Rita Ghosh', 'Addanki P Kumar']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Mol Carcinog""","""[""Recepteur d'origine nantais (RON), more than a kinase: Role in castrate-resistant prostate cancer."", 'Racial disparities in lymph node dissection at radical prostatectomy: A Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results database analysis.', 'Understanding PSA and its derivatives in prediction of tumor volume: Addressing health disparities in prostate cancer risk stratification.', 'Enhanced expression of SOS1 is detected in prostate cancer epithelial cells from African-American men.', 'RON, a tyrosine kinase receptor involved in tumor progression and metastasis.', 'SIRT1 inhibition-induced senescence as a strategy to prevent prostate cancer progression.', 'Evidence for 2-Methoxyestradiol-Mediated Inhibition of Receptor Tyrosine Kinase RON in the Management of Prostate Cancer.', 'Zonal regulation of collagen-type proteins and posttranslational modifications in prostatic benign and cancer tissues by imaging mass spectrometry.', 'Targeting RON receptor tyrosine kinase for treatment of advanced solid cancers: antibody-drug conjugates as lead drug candidates for clinical trials.']"""

Digital rectal examination, transrectal ultrasonography and serum prostate specific antigen represents a diagnostic triad for the detection of prostatic carcinoma. About 50 years ago, Dr. Donald Gleason created a grading system for prostate cancer based on its histologic patterns. Currently, this system maintains its validity with various changes. New updates were made in 2005 and 2014 by the International Society of Urological Pathology. The goal of biopsies is to determine the Gleason score and prognosis in prostatectomy material. The aim of this study was to determine the concordance of the Gleason score, tumor volume and tumor laterality between prostate needle biopsy and prostatectomy materials.  Material and method:   The study was performed with 112 patients who had biopsy and prostatectomy materials. The Gleason grades of the tumors have been evaluated with the new grading system. Tumor volumes were calculated by the number of positive blocks while tumor laterality was evaluated as unilateral or bilateral. Statistical analysis was performed on the obtained data.  Results:   Gleason score, tumor volume and tumor laterality discordance between needle biopsy and prostatectomy materials was found to be statistically significant. However, the concordance increased as the Gleason score and tumor volume increased.  Conclusion:   Digital examination, serum prostate specific antigen value and needle biopsy together are very sensitive for a prostate adenocarcinoma diagnosis.

In this study, YAP1 expression was upregulated in the whole cell lysates and cytoplasmic/nuclear extracts of AR negative (PC3) compared to AR positive (LNCaP) prostate cancer cell lines and primary prostate epithelial cells (PrePEC). pYAP1 expression elevated in LNCaP compared to PC3 and PrePEC in whole cell lysates and cytoplasmic extracts. The treatment of LNCaP and PC3 with YAP1-targeting siRNA oligonucleotides (YAP1 siRNA) significantly reduced their proliferation in vitro. Furthermore, treatment with YAP1 siRNA diminished the clonogenicity, anchorage-independent growth on soft agar, migration and invasion of PC3 cells. Co-IP/WB experiments revealed that YAP1 and AR formed a complex and ChIP/PCR results confirmed that YAP1 was bound to androgen response elements (ARE) core region of the prostate specific antigen (PSA) promoter. The loss of function experiments in LNCaP and PC3 revealed that YAP1 regulates proliferation, colony formation as well as anchorage-independent growth and potentially plays an important role in migration and invasion. Finally, analysis of publicly available data sets indicated that LNCaP had no YAP1 copy number alteration whereas PC3 had gain of YAP1 which was also reflected as an increase in the mRNA level. Moreover, YAP1 copy number gain and elevated YAP1 mRNA expression were detected in clinical samples analyzed in publicly available data sets.

However, there is a lack of data on surgical MDT in visceral/skeletal oligometastatic prostate cancer (PCa). We aimed to assess the role of surgical excision of visceral and skeletal PCa recurrence.  Methods:   Seventeen PCa patients experienced metachronous visceral or skeletal oligometastatic recurrence following maximal local treatment. Oligometastatic recurrence was defined as 1-3 lesions, detected with the best imaging technique available at the time of diagnosis. All patients underwent metastasectomy and were followed for a median of 43 months. Postoperative complications were graded using the Clavien-Dindo classification of surgical complications. Kaplan-Meier plots were used to assess overall survival.  Results:   Fourteen patients (82%) had visceral lesions, two had bone lesions (12%), and one had an abdominal wall metastasis (6%). Four patients (24%) were under active ADT at the time of metastasectomy. PSA decreased after metastasectomy in 16 (94%) patients. Ten (77%) of the 13 ADT-naïve patients had a PSA decrease of ≥ 50%. Following metastasectomy, 16 (94.1%) patients developed metastatic recurrence of which 11 (64.7%) were again oligometastatic, amenable for repeated MDT. The median time to metastatic recurrence was 14 months (range 6.4-40). We observed 8% Clavien-Dindo grade 3-4 complications in 21 procedures.  Conclusions:   In this report, we analyzed the outcomes of surgical excision of visceral and skeletal PCa recurrence following primary treatment.

Results:   Eighty-six patients for a total of 117 lesions were treated with SBRT. The median follow-up was 30.7 months (range 4-91 months). The median new metastasis-free survival after SBRT was 12.3 months (95% CI 5.5-19.1 months). One- and two-year distant progression-free survival was 52.3% and 33.7%, respectively. Twenty-six out of 86 patients underwent a second course of SBRT due to further oligoprogressive disease: This resulted in a median systemic treatment-free survival of 21.8 months (95% CI 17.8-25.8 months). One-year systemic treatment-free survival was 72.1%.  Conclusion:   SBRT appears to be a promising approach in oligoprogressive castration-resistant prostate cancer.

Background:   While radiotherapy is the first line of treatment for prostate cancer, androgen blockade therapies are demonstrating significant survival benefit as monotherapies. As androgen blockade can cause cell death by apoptosis, it is likely that androgen blockade will potentiate the cytotoxic activities of radiotherapy.  Materials and methods:   Here, we tested the potential synergistic effects of these two treatments over two human metastatic prostate cancer cells by real-time cell analysis (RTCA), androgen-sensitive LNCaP cells (Lymph Node Carcinoma of the Prostate) and androgen-independent PC-3. Both cell lines were highly resistant to high doses of radiotherapy.  Results:   A pre-treatment of LNCaP cells with IC50 concentrations of enzalutamide significantly sensitized them to radiotherapy through enhanced apoptosis. In contrast, enzalutamide resistant PC-3 cells were not sensitized to radiotherapy by androgen blockade.

Here, we explored the role of histone demethylase NO66 in the pathogenesis of PCa and bone metastasis-related skeletal lesions. Tissue and cDNA microarrays of PCa were analyzed for NO66 mRNA and protein levels. We examined the effects of gain and loss of NO66 function on cell viability, colony formation, migration, invasion, and tumor-induced skeletal lesions in femoral bone. RNAseq and ChIPseq were performed to elucidate NO66-target genes in PCa. We report that NO66 levels were upregulated in advanced primary prostate tumors compared to normal tissue or tumors with low Gleason scores. Forced expression of NO66 promoted cell survival and invasion of PCa cells; whereas, knockdown of NO66 resulted in decreased cell survival and increased sensitivity to docetaxel. NO66-overexpressing PC3 cells implanted into the femoral bone of male SCID mice caused massive bone loss and stimulation of mouse osteoclast-promoting genes, including Dickkopf1, Cathepsin K, Nf-kβ,; and Calcr, suggesting a role for NO66 in tumor growth in bone and osteoclast activity. Combined RNAseq and ChIP-seq revealed that NO66 activates the survival gene MCL1, the invasion-associated genes IGFBP5 and MMP3, the pro-oncogenic genes CTNNB1 and CCND1, and the epigenetic modifier gene KMT2A in androgen-independent PCa.

Here, we demonstrated a significant reduction of ADI1, either in protein or mRNA level, in HCC tissues. Additionally, higher ADI1 levels were associated with favorable postoperative recurrence-free survival in HCC patients. By altering ADI1 expression in HCC cells, a negative correlation between ADI1 and cell proliferation was observed. Cell-based and xenograft experiments were performed by using cells overexpressing ADI1 mutants carrying mutations at the metal-binding sites (E94A and H133A, respectively), which selectively disrupted differential catalytic steps, resulting in staying or leaving the MTA cycle. The results showed that the growth suppression effect was mediated by accelerating the MTA cycle. A cDNA microarray analysis followed by verification experiments identified that caveolin-1 (CAV1), a growth-promoting protein in HCC, was markedly decreased upon ADI1 overexpression. Suppression of CAV1 expression was mediated by an increase of S-adenosylmethionine (SAMe) level. The methylation status of CAV1 promoter was significantly altered upon ADI1 overexpression. Finally, a genome-wide methylation analysis revealed that ADI1 overexpression altered promoter methylation profiles in a set of cancer-related genes, including CAV1 and genes encoding antisense non-coding RNAs, long non-coding RNAs, and microRNAs, resulting in significant changes of their expression levels. In conclusion, ADI1 expression promoted MTA cycle to increase SAMe levels, which altered genome-wide promoter methylation profiles, resulting in altered gene expression and HCC growth suppression.""","""['Yu-De Chu', 'Hsin-Yu Lai', 'Li-Mei Pai', 'Ya-Hui Huang', 'Yang-Hsiang Lin', 'Kung-Hao Liang', 'Chau-Ting Yeh']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Cell Death Dis""","""[""Down-regulation of methylthioadenosine phosphorylase (MTAP) induces progression of hepatocellular carcinoma via accumulation of 5'-deoxy-5'-methylthioadenosine (MTA)."", 'MicroRNA-301b-3p contributes to tumour growth of human hepatocellular carcinoma by repressing vestigial like family member 4.', 'Long noncoding RNA GIHCG promotes hepatocellular carcinoma progression through epigenetically regulating miR-200b/a/429.', 'Pleiotropic effects of methionine adenosyltransferases deregulation as determinants of liver cancer progression and prognosis.', 'Specific molecular signatures of non-tumor liver tissue may predict a risk of hepatocarcinogenesis.', 'WWOX-rs13338697 genotype predicts therapeutic efficacy of ADI-PEG 20 for patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma.', 'GALNT14-mediated O-glycosylation on PHB2 serine-161 enhances cell growth, migration and drug resistance by activating IGF1R cascade in hepatoma cells.', 'Metabolomic Analysis Points to Bioactive Lipid Species and Acireductone Dioxygenase 1 (ADI1) as Potential Therapeutic Targets in Poor Prognosis Endometrial Cancer.', 'Serine and one-carbon metabolisms bring new therapeutic venues in prostate cancer.', 'COX5B-Mediated Bioenergetic Alterations Modulate Cell Growth and Anticancer Drug Susceptibility by Orchestrating Claudin-2 Expression in Colorectal Cancers.']"""

Design:   Modelling and validation of the lifetime risk method using publicly available population data.  Setting:   Opportunistic screening for prostate cancer in the Australian population.  Participants:   Australian male population (1982-2012).  Interventions:   Prostate-specific antigen testing for prostate cancer screening.  Primary and secondary outcome measures:   Primary: lifetime risk of overdiagnosis in 2012 (excess lifetime cancer risk adjusted for changing competing mortality); Secondary: lifetime risk of prostate cancer diagnosis (unadjusted and adjusted for competing mortality); Excess lifetime risk of prostate cancer diagnosis (for all years subsequent to 1982).  Results:   The lifetime risk of being diagnosed with prostate cancer increased from 6.1% in 1982 (1 in 17) to 19.6% in 2012 (1 in 5). Using 2012 competing mortality rates, the lifetime risk in 1982 was 11.5% (95% CI 11.0% to 12.0%). The excess lifetime risk of prostate cancer in 2012 (adjusted for changing competing mortality) was 8.2% (95% CI 7.6% to 8.7%) (1 in 13). This corresponds to 41% of prostate cancers being overdiagnosed.  Conclusions:   Our estimated rate of overdiagnosis is in agreement with estimates using other methods. This method may be used without the need to adjust for lead times. If annual (cross-sectional) data are used, then it may give valid estimates of overdiagnosis once screening has been established long enough for the benefits from the early detection of non-overdiagnosed cancer at a younger age to be realised in older age groups.""","""['Thanya Pathirana', 'Andrew Hayen', 'Jenny Doust', 'Paul Glasziou', 'Katy Bell']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""BMJ Open""","""['Estimating the magnitude of cancer overdiagnosis in Australia.', 'Opportunistic testing versus organized prostate-specific antigen screening: outcome after 18 years in the Göteborg randomized population-based prostate cancer screening trial.', 'Empirical estimates of prostate cancer overdiagnosis by age and prostate-specific antigen.', 'Prostate-Specific Antigen-Based Screening for Prostate Cancer: Evidence Report and Systematic Review for the US Preventive Services Task Force.', 'Overdiagnosis and overtreatment of prostate cancer.', 'Assessing overdiagnosis of fecal immunological test screening for colorectal cancer with a digital twin approach.', 'Diagnostic activity impacts lifetime risk of prostate cancer diagnosis more strongly than life expectancy.', 'Including Information on Overdiagnosis in Shared Decision Making: A Review of Prostate Cancer Screening Decision Aids.', 'How Much Information Do Icelandic Men Receive on Pros and Cons of Prostate-Specific Antigen Testing Prior to Undergoing Testing?', 'The utility of magnetic resonance imaging in prostate cancer diagnosis in the Australian setting.']"""

Some short tandem repeat sequences, distributed throughout the human genome, can play a role as cis-regulatory elements of the genes. Distributions of tandem long (≥10) and short (<10) A-T repeats in the genome are different depending on gene functions. Long repeats are more commonly found in housekeeping genes and may regulate genes in harmonious fashion. Mononucleotide A-repeats around transcription start sites interact with Argonaute proteins (AGOs) to regulate gene expression. miRNA-bound AGO alterations in cancer have been reported; consequently, these changes would affect genes containing mononucleotide A- and T-repeats. Here, we showed an unprecedented hallmark of gene regulation in cancer. We evaluated the gene expression profiles reported in the Gene Expression Omnibus and found a high density of 13-27 A-T repeats in the up-regulated genes in malignancies derived from the bladder, cervix, head and neck, ovary, vulva, breast, colon, liver, lung, prostate, kidney, thyroid, adrenal gland, bone, blood cells, muscle and brain. Transfection of cell-penetrating protein tag AGO1 containing poly uracils (CPP-AGO1-polyUs) to the lung cancer cell lines altered gene regulation depending on the presence of long A-T repeats. CPP-AGO1-polyUs limited cell proliferation and the ability of a cancer cell to grow into a colony in lung cancer cell lines. In conclusion, long A-T repeats up-regulated many genes in cancer that can be targeted by AGO1 to change the expression of many genes and limited cancer growth.""","""['Piyapat Pin-On', 'Chatchawit Aporntewan', 'Jirattha Siriluksana', 'Narumol Bhummaphan', 'Pithi Chanvorachote', 'Apiwat Mutirangura']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Gene""","""['Targeting multiple genes containing long mononucleotide A-T repeats in lung cancer stem cells.', 'Upstream mononucleotide A-repeats play a cis-regulatory role in mammals through the DICER1 and Ago proteins.', 'Nuclear role for human Argonaute-1 as an estrogen-dependent transcription coactivator.', 'Regulation of microRNA-1 (miR-1) expression in human cancer.', 'Seeking the truth behind the myth: Argonaute tales from ""nuclearland"".', 'Circ_0000052/miR-382-3p axis induces PD-L1 expression and regulates cell proliferation and immune evasion in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.', 'Mononucleotide A-repeats may Play a Regulatory Role in Endothermic Housekeeping Genes.', 'Circulating miR-17 as a promising diagnostic biomarker for lung adenocarcinoma: evidence from the Gene Expression Omnibus.', 'Targeting multiple genes containing long mononucleotide A-T repeats in lung cancer stem cells.', 'Argonaute Proteins Take Center Stage in Cancers.']"""

Low, medium, and high BL was recorded in 31.4vs. 45.7vs. 22.9% for ORP and in 39.8vs. 45.2vs.15.0% for RALP. MLRM predicting potency revealed that high BL was an independent predictor for erectile dysfunction: Odds ratios (OR) were 0.50 (P = 0.03) and 0.52 (P = 0.04) for ORP and RALP, respectively. MRLM predicting continence in ORP revealed that high BL was an independent predictor for 7-days and mid-term: ORs were 0.80 (P = 0.04) and 0.66 (P = 0.002). Moreover, high BL was an independent predictor for 7-days continence in RALP: OR were 0.68 (P = 0.009).  Conclusion:   CaP patients who sustain higher BL during RP showed worse functional outcomes. High BL during ORP or RALP represented an independent predictor of erectile dysfunction and incontinence after surgery. However, the effect of high BL on the continence was temporarily and not present at 1 year after surgery in ORP and after 3 months in RALP.""","""['Felix Preisser', 'Raisa S Pompe', 'Georg Salomon', 'Clemens Rosenbaum', 'Markus Graefen', 'Hartwig Huland', 'Pierre I Karakiewicz', 'Derya Tilki']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Urol Oncol""","""['Quality of Life After Open Radical Prostatectomy Compared with Robot-assisted Radical Prostatectomy.', 'Functional and Oncologic Outcomes Between Open and Robotic Radical Prostatectomy at 24-month Follow-up in the Swedish LAPPRO Trial.', 'Radical prostatectomy: initial experience with robot-assisted laparoscopic procedures at a large university hospital.', 'Comparison of retropubic, laparoscopic and robotic radical prostatectomy: who is the winner?', 'Robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy.', 'Predictors of urinary function recovery after laparoscopic and robot-assisted radical prostatectomy.', 'Influence of operative time and blood loss on surgical margins and functional outcomes for laparoscopic versus robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy: a prospective analysis.', 'Surgical techniques to improve continence recovery after robot-assisted radical prostatectomy.', 'The Effect of Adverse Patient Characteristics on Perioperative Outcomes in Open and Robot-Assisted Radical Prostatectomy.']"""

Further, patient satisfaction is a determinant of healthcare organizations' institutional performance. The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between patient satisfaction with care and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) among Medicare recipients with common cancers types (breast, prostate, or lung cancer).  Methods:   Cross-sectional analysis of survey data from 637 Medicare beneficiaries (≥65 years) with breast (n = 304), lung (n = 158), or prostate cancer (n = 175) in twelve hospitals in the Southeastern United States. Participants responded eighteen satisfaction questions across five domains. HRQoL was measured with the Physical Component Summary (PCS) and Mental Component Summary (MCS) scores of the SF-12.v2 instrument.  Results:   SF-12 scores were positively associated with satisfaction domain scores. The magnitude of these associations was small with covariate-adjusted effect sizes r ranging from 0.05 to 0.12. Satisfaction scores were highest within the Quality of Care domain and lowest within the Patient Engagement domain.  Conclusions:   Patient satisfaction domains had only modest association with HRQoL, indicating that these constructs should not be assumed to correlate. Satisfaction domains, including how patients access care, coordinate care, and engage within the healthcare system, were identified as potential areas for improvement. Patient satisfaction assessment across age groups may inform oncology care providers on ways in which their patients perceive the quality of care received, which ultimately affect healthcare organizations' accreditation, ranking, and reimbursement.""","""['Andres Azuero', 'Courtney P Williams', 'Maria Pisu', 'Stacey A Ingram', 'Kelly M Kenzik', 'Grant R Williams', 'Gabrielle B Rocque']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""J Geriatr Oncol""","""['Re: An Examination of the Relationship between Patient Satisfaction with Healthcare and Quality of Life in a Geriatric Population with Cancer in the Southeastern United States.', 'Hospital differences in patient satisfaction with care for breast, colorectal, lung and prostate cancers.', 'Assessing quality of life in an ambulatory medicare population.', 'Association of falls with health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in older cancer survivors: A population based study.', 'Health-related quality of life among elderly breast cancer patients treated with adjuvant endocrine therapy: a U.S Medicare population-based study.', 'Exercise interventions on health-related quality of life for people with cancer during active treatment.', 'Correlation between Quality of Life under Treatment and Current Life Satisfaction among Cancer Survivors Aged 75 Years and Older Receiving Outpatient Chemotherapy in Ishikawa Prefecture, Japan.', 'Factors contributing to satisfaction with care in cancer outpatients.']"""

Objective:   To compare QOL of patients pursuing SBRT and EBRT versus AS.  Design, setting, and participants:   A population-based cohort of 680 men with newly diagnosed localized prostate cancer was prospectively enrolled from 2011 to 2013.  Intervention:   SBRT, EBRT without androgen deprivation therapy, or AS.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   QOL was prospectively assessed before treatment (baseline), and at 3, 12, and 24mo after treatment using the validated Prostate Cancer Symptom Indices, which contain four domains: sexual dysfunction, urinary obstruction/irritation, urinary incontinence, and bowel problems. Propensity weighting via logistic regression models was used to balance baseline characteristics, and the mean QOL scores of EBRT and SBRT patients were compared against AS patients as the control group.  Results and limitations:   Compared with AS patients, EBRT patients had worse urinary obstructive/irritative symptoms and sexual dysfunction at 3mo, and worse bowel symptoms at 3 and 24mo. SBRT patients had similar scores as AS patients in all domains and across all time points; however, due to small sample size, worse sexual function and urinary incontinence in SBRT patients cannot be ruled out. Further research is needed to assess long-term outcomes.  Conclusions:   In a nonrandomized cohort of men with localized prostate cancer, SBRT appeared to result in favorable QOL results through 2yr of follow-up, but worse sexual function and urinary incontinence compared with AS cannot be ruled out completely. Larger studies with longer follow-up are needed to confirm these findings.

Abiraterone effectively target adrenal and tumor androgen production in castration-resistant PC (CRPC). However, abiraterone-resistant CRPC is now common challenge in clinic via multiple mechanisms.  Methods:   In this study, human CRPC cell line PC3 and androgen-sensitive cells LNCaP were used. The authors investigated the role of autophagy during the therapy of abiraterone in CRPC by analysis of transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Western blot and immunofluorescence assay. Cell cycle and apoptosis using flow cytometry analysis.  Results:   The analysis of TEM showed more autophagic vesicles (AVs) in PC3 cell line than that in LNCaP cell line and indicated the high basic cellular autophagy in CRPC cell line PC3, which was confirmed by the upregulation of autophagy-related protein LC3, Atg5, and Beclin1. Interestingly, the treatment of abiraterone reduced the level of autophagic vesicles in two cell lines and inhibited the expressions of autophagic markers LC3, Atg5 and Beclin1 in parallel with decreased cell vitality and induced G2/M arrest in PC3 cell line and LNCaP cell line. Moreover, the addition of the autophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine to the treatment of abiraterone inhibited the formation of AVs with downregulated autophagic markers, and inhibition of autophagy promoted the efficiency of cytotoxicity of abiraterone with further impaired cell vitality and G2/M arrest.

The modern bioanalytical techniques can study the adverse therapeutic effects of drugs by comparing isotopically labeled internal standards.

Recent studies on prostate cancer provide strong evidence that epigenetic mechanisms are major players in the regulation of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and their binding partner tissue inhibitor of MMPs (TIMPs) involved in prostate cancer progression. Here we demonstrate that GTP/EGCG mediate epigenetic reactivation of TIMP-3 that plays a key role in suppressing invasiveness and cancer progression. Treatment of human prostate cancer DUPRO and LNCaP cells with 10 µg/mL GTP and 20 µM EGCG induced TIMP-3 mRNA and protein expression. This transcriptional activation of TIMP-3 was associated with the decrease in the expression of both enhancers of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) and its catalytic product trimethylation of histone H3 at lysine 27 (H3K27me3) repressive marks at the TIMP-3 promoter with an accompanying increase in histone H3K9/18 acetylation. In addition, GTP/EGCG treatment significantly reduced class I histone deacetylase (HDAC) activity/expression and EZH2 and H3K27me3 levels in prostate cancer cells. EGCG/GTP exposure also reduced MMP-2/MMP-9 gelatinolytic activity and abrogated invasion and migration capabilities in these cells. Silencing of EZH2 and class I HDACs strikingly increased the expression of TIMP-3 independent of DNA methylation. Furthermore, clinical trials performed on patients undergoing prostatectomy consuming 800 mg EGCG (Polyphenon E) up to 6 weeks and grade-matched controls demonstrate an increase in plasma TIMP-3 levels. A marked reduction in class I HDACs activity/expression and EZH2 and H3K27me3 levels were noted in GTP-supplemented prostate tissue. Our findings highlight that TIMP-3 induction, as a key epigenetic event modulated by green tea in restoring the MMP:TIMP balance suppresses prostate cancer progression.""","""['Gauri Deb', 'Eswar Shankar', 'Vijay S Thakur', 'Lee E Ponsky', 'Donald R Bodner', 'Pingfu Fu', 'Sanjay Gupta']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Mol Carcinog""","""['Epigenetic induction of tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase-3 by green tea polyphenols in breast cancer cells.', 'Green tea polyphenols increase p53 transcriptional activity and acetylation by suppressing class I histone deacetylases.', 'The role of EZH2 in the regulation of the activity of matrix metalloproteinases in prostate cancer cells.', 'Molecular targets for green tea in prostate cancer prevention.', 'Epigenetic Changes Induced by Green Tea Catechins a re Associated with Prostate Cancer.', 'Epigallocatechin-3-Gallate Therapeutic Potential in Cancer: Mechanism of Action and Clinical Implications.', 'Recent progress in DNA methyltransferase inhibitors as anticancer agents.', 'Green Tea in Reproductive Cancers: Could Treatment Be as Simple?', 'The Involvement of Natural Polyphenols in Molecular Mechanisms Inducing Apoptosis in Tumor Cells: A Promising Adjuvant in Cancer Therapy.', 'Polyphenon E Effects on Gene Expression in PC-3 Prostate Cancer Cells.']"""

For clinical screening and diagnosis of abnormally invasive placenta (AIP), a life-threatening obstetric condition, qualitative and quantitative analysis of ultrasonic patterns correlated to placental lesions such as placental lacunae (PL) is challenging and time-consuming to perform even for experienced sonographers. There is a need for automated placental lesion localization that does not rely on expensive human annotations such as detailed manual segmentation of anatomical structures. In this paper, we investigate PL localization in 2D placental ultrasound images. First, we demonstrate the effectiveness of generating confidence maps from weak dot annotations in localizing PL as an alternative to expensive manual segmentation. Then we propose a layer aggregation structure based on iterative deep aggregation (IDA) for PL localization. Models with this structure were evaluated with 10-fold cross-validations on an AIP database (containing 3,440 images with 9,618 labelled PL from 23 AIP and 11 non-AIP participants). Experimental results demonstrate that the model with the proposed structure yielded the highest mean average precision (mAP=35.7%), surpassing all other baseline models (32.6%, 32.2%, 29.7%). We argue that features from shallower stages can contribute to PL localization more effectively using the proposed structure. To our knowledge, this is the first successful application of machine learning to placental lesion analysis and has the potential to be adapted for other clinical scenarios in breast, liver, and prostate cancer imaging.""","""['Huan Qi', 'Sally Collins', 'J Alison Noble']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Med Image Comput Comput Assist Interv""","""['Weakly Supervised Learning of Placental Ultrasound Images with Residual Networks.', 'Diagnostic accuracy of first-trimester ultrasound in detecting abnormally invasive placenta in high-risk women with placenta previa.', 'Automatic staging of placental maturity based on dense descriptor.', 'First-trimester detection of abnormally invasive placenta in high-risk women: systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Diagnostic accuracy of ultrasound in detecting the severity of abnormally invasive placentation: a systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Applications of Advanced Ultrasound Technology in Obstetrics.', 'Spatially Aware Dense-LinkNet Based Regression Improves Fluorescent Cell Detection in Adaptive Optics Ophthalmic Images.']"""

Each center used a site-specific method to measure the individual AIF from each data set and submitted the results to the managing center. These AIFs, their reference tissue-adjusted variants, and a literature population-averaged AIF, were used by the managing center to perform SSM PK analysis to estimate Ktrans (volume transfer rate constant), ve (extravascular, extracellular volume fraction), kep (efflux rate constant), and τi (mean intracellular water lifetime). All other variables, including the definition of the tumor region of interest and precontrast T1 values, were kept the same to evaluate parameter variations caused by variations in only the AIF. Considerable PK parameter variations were observed with within-subject coefficient of variation (wCV) values of 0.58, 0.27, 0.42, and 0.24 for Ktrans, ve, kep, and τi, respectively, using the unadjusted AIFs. Use of the reference tissue-adjusted AIFs reduced variations in Ktrans and ve (wCV = 0.50 and 0.10, respectively), but had smaller effects on kep and τi (wCV = 0.39 and 0.22, respectively). kep is less sensitive to AIF variation than Ktrans, suggesting it may be a more robust imaging biomarker of prostate microvasculature. With low sensitivity to AIF uncertainty, the SSM-unique τi parameter may have advantages over the conventional PK parameters in a longitudinal study.""","""['Wei Huang', 'Yiyi Chen', 'Andriy Fedorov', 'Xia Li', 'Guido H Jajamovich', 'Dariya I Malyarenko', 'Madhava P Aryal', 'Peter S LaViolette', 'Matthew J Oborski', ""Finbarr O'Sullivan"", 'Richard G Abramson', 'Kourosh Jafari-Khouzani', 'Aneela Afzal', 'Alina Tudorica', 'Brendan Moloney', 'Sandeep N Gupta', 'Cecilia Besa', 'Jayashree Kalpathy-Cramer', 'James M Mountz', 'Charles M Laymon', 'Mark Muzi', 'Paul E Kinahan', 'Kathleen Schmainda', 'Yue Cao', 'Thomas L Chenevert', 'Bachir Taouli', 'Thomas E Yankeelov', 'Fiona Fennessy', 'Xin Li']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Tomography""","""['The Impact of Arterial Input Function Determination Variations on Prostate Dynamic Contrast-Enhanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging Pharmacokinetic Modeling: A Multicenter Data Analysis Challenge.', 'A comparison of two methods for estimating DCE-MRI parameters via individual and cohort based AIFs in prostate cancer: a step towards practical implementation.', 'Repeatability of arterial input functions and kinetic parameters in muscle obtained by dynamic contrast enhanced MR imaging of the head and neck.', 'Relative sensitivities of DCE-MRI pharmacokinetic parameters to arterial input function (AIF) scaling.', 'Assessment of repeatability and treatment response in early phase clinical trials using DCE-MRI: comparison of parametric analysis using MR- and CT-derived arterial input functions.', 'Implementation and evaluation of a dynamic contrast enhanced mr perfusion protocol for glioblastoma using a 0.35T mri-Linac system.', 'Semi-quantitative and quantitative dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) MRI parameters as prostate cancer imaging biomarkers for biologically targeted radiation therapy.', 'Maximum Entropy Technique and Regularization Functional for Determining the Pharmacokinetic Parameters in DCE-MRI.', 'Modified Maximum Entropy Method and Estimating the AIF via DCE-MRI Data Analysis.', 'Intrasession Reliability of Arterial Spin-Labeled MRI-Measured Noncontrast Perfusion in Glioblastoma at 3 T.']"""

Loss of PTEN is an important event in prostate carcinogenesis. Metabolic reprogramming induced by PTEN loss fuels malignant growth and proliferation of prostate cancer cells. Targeted metabolomics analysis was used to investigate the effects of PTEN loss on intracellular metabolic pathways in prostate cancer cells. DU-145 cells were transfected with PTEN siRNAs (siRNA-1 and siRNA-2) for 48 h, and endogenous PTEN expression was monitored by western blotting. Changes in intracellular metabolites were determined by liquid chromatography-tandem mass chromatography (LC-MS/MS) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Most intracellular metabolites involved in glycolysis and glutaminolysis were increased in PTEN knockdown prostate cancer cells. In addition, most intracellular metabolites involved in fatty acid de novo synthesis, fatty acid beta oxidation and branched chain amino acid catabolism were also increased in PTEN knockdown prostate cancer cells. These results revealed that PTEN loss induced the metabolic reprogramming of prostate cancer cells and promoted the malignant proliferation of prostate cancer cells. The present metabolomics analysis indicates that tumor suppressor gene PTEN mutation or deletion can induce metabolic reprogramming in prostate cancer cells and tumorigenesis by altering the metabolic flux of glycolysis, glutaminolysis, fatty acid metabolism and branched chain amino acid catabolism pathways.

Low Zn levels as well as overexpression of metalothioneins were implicated in the development and progression of various cancers including the prostate. Nonetheless, wider elemental profiles that relate cancer and normal phenotypes with regards to metal homeostasis were not well elucidated in the literature. Moreover, laboratory animals are currently used as accepted models for studying cancer but the level of their representation of actual cancer tissues was not clear. This study is attempting to assess the relevance of animal models currently in use, as surrogates for cancer and establish their relationship to actual normal and cancer tissues from humans. The major focus of this study was to investigate the differential relationship of metal concentrations and profiles in cancer and normal tissues from cadavers of humans and their comparison to established animal models representing organ cancers. The working hypothesis was that elemental/metal concentrations and profiles seen in post mortem will show significant differences between normal and cancer-derived tissues as well as between various tissue types in humans, rats, and dogs. This study also establishes critical elemental/metal profiles that may be relevant in providing correlations with the development of three major cancers. Normal human and tumor tissues of cadaverous lung, breast, and liver used in this study were obtained from US Biomax Company and relevant animal models (Sprague-dawley and Brown Norwegian rats as well as dogs; were obtained from Jackson Laboratories and the Mississippi State Veterinary Laboratory in Pearl, MS), to analyze for elements and test the hypothesis. Tissue samples were prepared using standardized digestion procedures necessary for use with the Inductively Coupled Plasma-Atomic Emission mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS) to determine the concentrations and profiles of 21 elements including Ag, Al, As, Ba, Ca, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mg, Mn, Na, Ni, Pb, Sb, Se, Sr, Tl, V, and Zn. Our data supports the notion that metal/elemental homeostasis is essential for normal tissue function and that elemental variations in content, distributions, and ranking are tissue specific as well as carcinoma and species-specific. Analysis of data showed significant variations in elemental content and distribution profiles/ranking between animal models and actual human tissues consistent with the hypothesis. It is concluded that elemental homeostasis is essential for normal tissue function and that shifts in their distribution and content are essential in determining the use of animal models as surrogates for studying cancer. These results are promising and warrant further studies to confirm the relevance of animal models in relation to their use as pre-clinical tools for examining targeted cancer therapeutics.""","""['Ibrahim O Farah', 'Zikri Arslan', 'Michelle Tucci', 'Hamed Benghuzzi', 'Joseph A Cameron']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Biomed Sci Instrum""","""['Significance of differential metal loads in normal versus cancerous cadaver tissues - biomed 2010.', 'Imaging of metals, metalloids, and non-metals by laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) in biological tissues.', 'Searching the most appropriate sample pretreatment for the elemental analysis of wines by inductively coupled plasma-based techniques.', 'Discrimination of Free-Range and Caged Eggs by Chemometrics Analysis of the Elemental Profiles of Eggshell.', 'The Metallome of Lung Cancer and its Potential Use as Biomarker.']"""

We aimed to describe the incidence, prevalence, and predictors of late patient-reported rectal bleeding after Cs-131 brachytherapy.  Methods and materials:   We reviewed a prospectively collected database of 620 men treated with Cs-131 prostate brachytherapy. Of 620 patients, 390 (62.9%) received brachytherapy as monotherapy; the remainder received combination therapy with external beam radiation therapy (EBRT). Patients were administered Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite questionnaires preoperatively and postoperatively at each follow-up visit. The primary outcome was late rectal bleeding, defined as rectal bleeding reported at the 6-month follow-up or later. Clinically significant rectal bleeding was defined as occurring more than ""rarely,"" and clinically significant bother from rectal bleeding was defined as considering bleeding more than a ""very small problem."" Univariate and multivariate Cox regression were performed to identify factors predictive for rectal bleeding.  Results:   With a median follow-up time of 48 months, the cumulative incidence of clinically significant late rectal bleeding was 12.4%, with 15.2% reporting clinically significant bother from bleeding. At the time of last follow-up, the prevalence of clinically significant rectal bleeding and bother were 4.0% and 4.7%, respectively. On univariate analysis, acute clinically significant rectal bleeding, defined as occurring within the first 6 months (P = .001) and combination therapy with EBRT (P = .001) predicted for clinically significant late rectal bleeding.

We hypothesized that urinary volatile organic compounds (VOCs) may be the source of that odor and could be used to develop urinary VOC PCa diagnosis models.  Patients and methods:   Urine samples from 55 and 53 biopsy proven PCa-positive and -negative patients respectively were initially obtained for diagnostic model development. Urinary metabolites were analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. A PCa diagnosis model was developed and validated using innovative statistical machine-learning techniques. A second set of samples (53 PCa-positive and 22 PCa-negative patients) were used to evaluate the previously developed PCa diagnosis model.  Results:   The analysis resulted in 254 and 282 VOCs for their significant association (P < .05) with either PCa-positive or -negative samples respectively. Regularized logistic regression analysis and the Firth method were then applied to predict PCa prevalence, resulting in a final model that contains 11 VOCs. Under cross-validation, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) for the final model was 0.92 (sensitivity, 0.96; specificity, 0.80). Further evaluation of the developed model using a testing cohort yielded an AUC of 0.86. As a comparison, the PSA-based diagnosis model only rendered an AUC of 0.54.

Material and methods:   All patients diagnosed with prostate cancer between 2005 and 2015 in the Netherlands were identified from the nationwide population-based Netherlands Cancer Registry (NCR). Patient and tumour characteristics, as well as applied treatments, were described by age groups and prognostic risk groups. Relative survival rates were determined, including multivariable relative survival regression analyses. Additionally, to assess if age was associated with receiving curative treatment, a multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed.  Results:   In total, 48% of all patients were 70 years of age or older. Older patients had a higher prostate specific antigen (PSA) level, a higher Gleason score, as well as a higher disease stage at diagnosis. The 10-year relative survival decreased with increasing age, and after adjustment for disease stage, Gleason score, PSA level, and comorbidities, older patients had a worse survival rate. Older patients with intermediate- or high-risk disease appeared to be treated less often with curative intent compared with younger patients after adjustment for tumour stage, Gleason score, PSA level, and comorbidities. Older patients with intermediate/high risk prostate cancer treated with curative intent showed a 10-year relative survival rate similar to younger patients.  Conclusion:   The survival of older patients was worse than younger patients. This might be due to suboptimal treatment, as older patients were less often treated with curative intent. Although the increased risk of treatment complications should be considered, age alone should not be a decisive factor when offering a treatment.""","""['Robin W M Vernooij', 'Inge van Oort', 'Theo M de Reijke', 'Katja K H Aben']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""J Geriatr Oncol""","""['Management of localised prostate cancer: watchful waiting, surgery or radiation therapy, depending on the natural course, which is often relatively slow.', 'Factors associated with initial treatment and survival for clinically localized prostate cancer: results from the CDC-NPCR Patterns of Care Study (PoC1).', 'Population-Based Assessment of Determining Treatments for Prostate Cancer.', 'Long-term Impact of Adjuvant Versus Early Salvage Radiation Therapy in pT3N0 Prostate Cancer Patients Treated with Radical Prostatectomy: Results from a Multi-institutional Series.', 'Contemporary grading for prostate cancer: implications for patient care.', 'Role of multidisciplinary team meetings in implementation of chemohormonal therapy in metastatic prostate cancer in daily practice.', 'The Latest Data Specifically Focused on Long-Term Oncologic Prognostication for Very Old Adults with Acute Vulnerable Localized Prostate Cancer: A Nationwide Cohort Study.', 'Long-Term Medical Resource Consumption of Radical Prostatectomy vs. Intensity-Modulated Radiotherapy for Old Patients With Prostate Cancer: A Nationwide Population-Based Cohort Study.', 'Symptom burden profiles in men with advanced prostate cancer undergoing androgen deprivation therapy.', 'Patterns of Care and Outcomes for Non-Metastatic Prostate Cancer in the United States: Results of the CancerMPact® Survey 2018.']"""

This study compared the impact of intimacy-enhancing therapy (IET), a general health and wellness intervention (GHW), and usual care (UC) on the psychological and relationship functioning of localized prostate cancer patients and their partners. Relationship length, relationship satisfaction, and patient masculinity were evaluated as moderators.  Design:   This study was a randomized clinical trial with three study arms and four assessment time points.  Methods:   A total of 237 patients and partners were randomly assigned to receive IET, GHW, or UC. Participants completed measures of psychological functioning and relationship satisfaction at baseline, 5 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months post-baseline. Primary outcomes were psychological adjustment, depression, cancer-specific distress, cancer concerns, and relationship satisfaction.  Results:   Spouses in IET showed greater increases in relationship satisfaction than spouses in GHW and UC between the baseline and 5-week follow-up. Among patients in longer relationships, significant increases in psychological adjustment were found in both treatments compared to UC. Among spouses in longer relationships, psychological adjustment increased in both IET and UC but declined in GHW.  Conclusions:   Intimacy-enhancing therapy did not show an impact on general or cancer-specific distress, but did show an early impact on relationship satisfaction among spouses. IET was superior to UC for patients in longer relationships. It will be important for researchers to understand which couple-focused interventions benefits both patients and spouses and to identify characteristics of patients, partners, and couples who may not benefit from psychological treatments. Statement of contribution What is already known on this subject? Men diagnosed with localized prostate cancer report lower health-related quality of life and both patients and spouses report elevated distress. Relationship communication plays a role in couples' psychological adaptation to prostate cancer. Couple-focused interventions have illustrated an impact on relationship communication. There are no studies comparing different couple-focused interventions. What does this study add? Intimacy-enhancing therapy was not superior to no treatment or a comparison treatment for the broad range of psychological and relationship outcomes. Intimacy-enhancing therapy was superior to no treatment for patients in longer-term relationship. The general health and wellness intervention was not beneficial for men in shorter relationships and for men who did not endorse traditional masculine norms.""","""['Sharon L Manne', 'Deborah A Kashy', 'Talia Zaider', 'David Kissane', 'David Lee', 'Isaac Y Kim', 'Carolyn J Heckman', 'Frank J Penedo', 'Evangelynn Murphy', 'Shannon Myers Virtue']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Br J Health Psychol""","""['Relationship intimacy processes during treatment for couple-focused interventions for prostate cancer patients and their spouses.', 'Intimacy-enhancing psychological intervention for men diagnosed with prostate cancer and their partners: a pilot study.', 'Communication and intimacy-enhancing interventions for men diagnosed with prostate cancer and their partners.', 'Holding back, intimacy, and psychological and relationship outcomes among couples coping with prostate cancer.', 'Dyadic coping and relationship functioning in couples coping with cancer: a systematic review.', 'Non-pharmacological interventions to manage psychological distress in patients living with cancer: a systematic review.', 'Effects of marital self-disclosure on marital relationship and psychological outcome for cancer patients: a systematic review.', ""Couple-Based Communication Interventions for Cancer Patient-Spousal Caregiver Dyads' Psychosocial Adaptation to Cancer: A Systematic Review."", 'Relationship intimacy processes during treatment for couple-focused interventions for prostate cancer patients and their spouses.', ""Cancer Caregivers' Prognostic and End-of-Life Communication Needs and Experiences and their Impact.""]"""

Patients with breast and prostate cancer are often treated with hormone-altering drugs that result in low BMD. These patients may have incidental osteoblastic metastases of the spine that may be detected on screening DEXA studies. The aim of this pilot study is to assess whether random forest classifiers or support vector machines can identify patients with incidental osteoblastic metastases of the spine from screening DEXA studies and to evaluate which technique is better.  Methods:   We retrospectively reviewed the DEXA studies from 200 patients (155 normal control patients and 45 patients with osteoblastic metastases of one or more lumbar vertebral bodies from L1 to L4). The dataset was split into training (80%) and validation (20%) datasets. The optimal random forest (RF) and support vector machine (SVM) classifiers were obtained. Receiver-operator-characteristic curves were compared with DeLong's test.  Results:   The sensitivity, specificity, accuracy and area under the curve (AUC) of the optimal RF classifier were 77.8%, 100.0%, 98.0% and 0.889, respectively, in the validation dataset. The sensitivity, specificity, accuracy and AUC of the optimal SVM classifier were 33.3%, 96.8%, 82.5% and 0.651 in the validation dataset. The RF classifier was significantly better than the SVM classifier (P = 0.008). Only 7 of the 45 patients with osteoblastic metastases (15.6%) were prospectively identified by the radiologist interpreting the study.

Specifically, the catechol estrogen-3,4-quinones can react with DNA to produce a large amount of specific depurinating estrogen-DNA adducts, formed at the N-3 of Ade and N-7 of Gua. Loss of these adducts leaves apurinic sites in the DNA, which can generate subsequent cancer-initiating mutations. Unbalanced estrogen metabolism yields excessive catechol estrogen-3,4-quinones, increasing formation of the depurinating estrogen-DNA adducts and the risk of initiating cancer. Evidence for this mechanism of cancer initiation comes from studies in vitro, in cell culture, in animal models and in human subjects. High levels of estrogen-DNA adducts have been observed in women with breast, ovarian or thyroid cancer, and in men with prostate cancer or non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Observation of high levels of depurinating estrogen-DNA adducts in high risk women before the presence of breast cancer indicates that adduct formation is a critical factor in breast cancer initiation. Two dietary supplements, N-acetylcysteine and resveratrol, complement each other in reducing formation of catechol estrogen-3,4-quinones and inhibiting formation of estrogen-DNA adducts in cultured human and mouse breast epithelial cells. They also inhibit malignant transformation of these epithelial cells. In addition, formation of adducts was reduced in women who followed a Healthy Breast Protocol that includes N-acetylcysteine and resveratrol. Blocking initiation of cancer prevents promotion, progression and development of the disease. These results suggest that reducing formation of depurinating estrogen-DNA adducts can reduce the risk of developing a variety of types of human cancer.""","""['Ercole L Cavalieri', 'Eleanor G Rogan']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""J Rare Dis Res Treat""","""[""Critical depurinating DNA adducts: Estrogen adducts in the etiology and prevention of cancer and dopamine adducts in the etiology and prevention of Parkinson's disease."", ""The molecular etiology and prevention of estrogen-initiated cancers: Ockham's Razor: Pluralitas non est ponenda sine necessitate.

Methods:   215 patients underwent SWE in six identical planes before biopsy guided with transrectal ultrasonography. The Young's modulus of the entire prostate gland was defined as the mean of the results in these planes. The measurements were compared with the pathological results, the prostate specific antigen (PSA), and the Gleason score (GS) after biopsy.  Results:   The Young's modulus of elasticity, including the maximum Young's modulus (Emax), the mean Young's modulus (Emean), and the minimum Young's modulus (Emin), were significantly higher in malignant lesions than those in benign lesions (all p < 0.05). The optimal cut-off values for PCa were 128.48 kPa, 62.27 kPa, and 20.03 kPa, respectively. The sensitivities were 77.88%, 81.42%, and 60.18%, respectively, and the specificities were 85.33%, 74.51 and 63.73 %, respectively.

Mutations in hZIP4 cause the disease acrodermatitis enteropathica. Dysfunction in the regulation of hZIP4 has also been indicated in solid tissue cancers, including pancreatic and prostate cancer. Although structural studies of the extracellular domain and computational modeling of the membrane domain suggest hZIP4 exists as a dimer, the oligomerization status of hZIP4 in the plasma membrane of mammalian cells has not been directly quantified in vivo. Here, the oligomeric state of hZIP4 expressed in HEK293 cells was quantified using fluorescence correlation spectroscopy. hZIP4 was tagged with eGFP, and by comparing brightness values (ε) of monomer and tandem eGFP constructs to that of an hZIP4/eGFP, we show that hZIP4 is a dimer. Determining that hZIP4 is a dimer is an important step toward understanding the function and processing of the protein, which can provide more insight into how diseases affected by hZIP4 occur and can be managed.""","""['Meghan E Ahern', 'Elizabeth M Bafaro', 'Ann Cowan', 'Robert E Dempski']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Biochemistry""","""['The transmembrane domains mediate oligomerization of the human ZIP4 transporter in vivo.', 'Zinc transporter mutations linked to acrodermatitis enteropathica disrupt function and cause mistrafficking.', 'Computation and Functional Studies Provide a Model for the Structure of the Zinc Transporter hZIP4.', 'Genetic causes and gene–nutrient interactions in mammalian zinc deficiencies: acrodermatitis enteropathica and transient neonatal zinc deficiency as examples.', 'The SLC39 family of metal ion transporters.', 'Structural mechanism of intracellular autoregulation of zinc uptake in ZIP transporters.', 'Structural insights into the elevator-type transport mechanism of a bacterial ZIP metal transporter.', 'Heterologous Expression of Full-Length and Truncated Human ZIP4 Zinc Transporter in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.', 'Zinc transporters and their functional integration in mammalian cells.', 'Transcription factors and transporters in zinc homeostasis: lessons learned from fungi.']"""

We proposed and validated a novel, paradigm-shifting hypothesis that this region is associated with a set of microRNA genes-miR-3622, miR-3622b, miR-383-that are lost in PCa and play important mechanistic roles in PCa progression and metastasis. Extending our hypothesis, in this study, we evaluated the role of a microRNA gene located in chromosome 8p-miR-4288-by employing clinical samples and cell lines. Our data suggests that (i) miR-4288 is widely downregulated in primary prostate tumors and cell lines; (ii) miR-4288 expression is lost in metastatic castration-resistant PCa; (ii) miR-4288 downregulation is race-related PCa alteration that is prevalent in Caucasian patients and not in African Americans; (iii) in Caucasians, miR-4288 was found to be associated with increasing tumor grade and high serum prostate-specific antigen, suggesting that miR-4288 downregulation/loss may be associated with tumor progression specifically in Caucasians; (iv) miR-4288 possess significant potential as a molecular biomarker to predict aggressiveness/metastasis; and (v) miR-4288 is anti-proliferative, is anti-invasive and inhibits epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition; and (vi) miR-4288 directly represses expression of metastasis/invasion-associated genes MMP16 and ROCK1. Thus, the present study demonstrates a tumor suppressor role for a novel miRNA located with a frequently lost region in PCa, strengthening our hypothesis that this locus is causally related to PCa disease progression via loss of microRNA genes.

In this study, we utilized PCa tissue specimens, cell lines and xenograft models to determine whether CUL4B contributes to PCa progression and metastasis. Here, we show that CUL4B expression highly correlates with the aggressiveness of PCa. CUL4B expression promotes proliferation, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, and metastatic potential of PCa cells, whereas CUL4B knockdown inhibits. Mechanically, CUL4B positively regulates SOX4, a key regulator in PCa, through epigenetic silencing of miR-204. In turn, SOX4 upregulates CUL4B expression through transcriptional activation, thereby fulfilling a positive feedback loop. Clinically, CUL4B+/SOX4+ defines a subset of PCa patients with poor prognosis. Bioinformatics analysis further reveals that Wnt/ß-catenin activation signature is enriched in CUL4B+/SOX4+ patient subgroup. Intriguingly, Wnt inhibitors significantly attenuates oncogenic capacities of CUL4B in vitro and in vivo.

Study outcomes were any type and site-specific cancer incidence rates on the basis of International Classification of Diseases-10 codes over a median follow-up of 5 years. To explore the possibility of detection bias and reverse causation, we divided the follow-up time into different time periods (≤12 and >12 months) and estimated risks for each of these intervals.  Results:   In total, 64,319 cases of cancer (affecting 9% of participants) were detected throughout 3,338,226 person-years. The relationship between eGFR and cancer incidence was U shaped.

Lower eGFR strata were significantly associated with higher risk of skin, urogenital, prostate, and hematologic cancers. Any cancer risk as well as skin (nonmelanoma) and urogenital cancer risks were significantly elevated throughout follow-up time, but they were higher in the first 12 months postregistration. Associations with hematologic and prostate cancers abrogated after the first 12 months of observation, suggesting the presence of detection bias and/or reverse causation.

Switching radiometal from 68Ga to 111In impaired tumor targeting in mice, but coinjection of the neprilysin (NEP)-inhibitor phosphoramidon (PA) stabilized 111In-SB3 in circulation and remarkably increased tumor uptake. We herein report on the biological profile of 111In-SB4: 111In-[dAla11]SB3. Methods: The biological responses of 111In-SB3/SB4 were compared in PC-3 cells and animal models. Results: Gly11/dAla11-replacement deteriorated GRPR-affinity (SB4 IC50: 10.7 ± 0.9 nM vs. SB3 IC50: 4.6 ± 0.3 nM) and uptake in PC-3 cells (111In-SB4: 1.3 ± 0.4% vs. 111In-SB3 16.2 ± 0.8% at 1 h). 111In-SB4 was more stable than 111In-SB3, but PA-coinjection stabilized both radiotracers in peripheral mice blood. Unmodified 111In-SB3 showed higher uptake in PC-3 xenografts (8.8 ± 3.0%ID/g) vs. 111In-SB4 (3.1 ± 1.1%ID/g) at 4 h pi. PA-coinjection improved tumor uptake, with 111In-SB3 still showing superior tumor targeting (38.3 ± 7.9%ID/g vs. 7.4 ± 0.3%ID/g for 111In-SB4). Conclusions: Replacement of Gly11 by dAla11 improved in vivo stability, however, at the cost of GRPR-affinity and cell uptake, eventually translating into inferior tumor uptake of 111In-SB4 vs. unmodified 111In-SB3. On the other hand, in-situ NEP-inhibition turned out to be a more efficient and direct strategy to optimize the in vivo profile of 111In-SB3, and potentially other peptide radiotracers.""","""['Emmanouil Lymperis', 'Aikaterini Kaloudi', 'Panagiotis Kanellopoulos', 'Marion de Jong', 'Eric P Krenning', 'Berthold A Nock', 'Theodosia Maina']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Molecules""","""['Radiometal-Dependent Biological Profile of the Radiolabeled Gastrin-Releasing Peptide Receptor Antagonist SB3 in Cancer Theranostics: Metabolic and Biodistribution Patterns Defined by Neprilysin.', 'Amide-to-triazole switch vs. in vivo NEP-inhibition approaches to promote radiopeptide targeting of GRPR-positive tumors.', 'Preclinical and first clinical experience with the gastrin-releasing peptide receptor-antagonist ⁶⁸GaSB3 and PET/CT.', 'In Vivo Stabilized SB3, an Attractive GRPR Antagonist, for Pre- and Intra-Operative Imaging for Prostate Cancer.', 'Comparative evaluation of the new GRPR-antagonist 111 In-SB9 and 111 In-AMBA in prostate cancer models: Implications of in vivo stability.', 'Preclinical Characterization of a Stabilized Gastrin-Releasing Peptide Receptor Antagonist for Targeted Cancer Theranostics.', 'Metal-Based Radiopharmaceuticals in Inorganic Chemistry.', 'Targeting the Gastrin-Releasing Peptide Receptor (GRP-R) in Cancer Therapy: Development of Bombesin-Based Peptide-Drug Conjugates.', 'Radiolabeled Bombesin Analogs.', '99mTcTc-DB15 in GRPR-Targeted Tumor Imaging with SPECT: From Preclinical Evaluation to the First Clinical Outcomes.']"""

We previously reported that the radiation response of human prostate tumours is critically regulated by CAV1 expression in stromal fibroblasts and that loss of stromal CAV1 expression in advanced tumour stages may contribute to tumour radiotherapy resistance. Here we investigated whether fibroblast secreted anti-apoptotic proteins could induce radiation resistance of prostate cancer cells in a CAV1-dependent manner and identified TRIAP1 (TP53 Regulated Inhibitor of Apoptosis 1) as a resistance-promoting CAV1-dependent factor. TRIAP1 expression and secretion was significantly higher in CAV1-deficient fibroblasts and secreted TRIAP1 was able to induce radiation resistance of PC3 and LNCaP prostate cancer cells in vitro, as well as of PC3 prostate xenografts derived from co-implantation of PC3 cells with TRIAP1-expressing fibroblasts in vivo. Immunohistochemical analyses of irradiated PC3 xenograft tumours, as well as of human prostate tissue specimen, confirmed that the characteristic alterations in stromal-epithelial CAV1 expression were accompanied by increased TRIAP1 levels after radiation in xenograft tumours and within advanced prostate cancer tissues, potentially mediating resistance to radiation treatment. In conclusion, we have determined the role of CAV1 alterations potentially induced by the CAV1-deficient, and more reactive, stroma in radio sensitivity of prostate carcinoma at a molecular level. We suggest that blocking TRIAP1 activity and thus avoiding drug resistance may offer a promising drug development strategy for inhibiting resistance-promoting CAV1-dependent signals.""","""['Julia Ketteler', 'Andrej Panic', 'Henning Reis', 'Alina Wittka', 'Patrick Maier', 'Carsten Herskind', 'Ernesto Yagüe', 'Verena Jendrossek', 'Diana Klein']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""J Clin Med""","""['Stromal Fibroblasts Counteract the Caveolin-1-Dependent Radiation Response of LNCaP Prostate Carcinoma Cells.', 'Progression-related loss of stromal Caveolin 1 levels fosters the growth of human PC3 xenografts and mediates radiation resistance.', 'Caveolin-1 regulates the ASMase/ceramide-mediated radiation response of endothelial cells in the context of tumor-stroma interactions.', 'Caveolin-1, cancer and therapy resistance.', 'Caveolin-1: a multifaceted driver of breast cancer progression and its application in clinical treatment.', 'Targeting the p53 signaling pathway in cancers: Molecular mechanisms and clinical studies.', 'Protein Levels of Anti-Apoptotic Mcl-1 and the Deubiquitinase USP9x Are Cooperatively Upregulated during Prostate Cancer Progression and Limit Response of Prostate Cancer Cells to Radiotherapy.', 'Cancer-associated fibroblast-derived gene signatures predict radiotherapeutic survival in prostate cancer patients.', 'Caveolae-Associated Molecules, Tumor Stroma, and Cancer Drug Resistance: Current Findings and Future Perspectives.', 'Stromal Fibroblasts Counteract the Caveolin-1-Dependent Radiation Response of LNCaP Prostate Carcinoma Cells.']"""

However, the clinical significance and biological role of miR-218-5p in bone metastasis of PCa remain unclear.  Materials and methods:   miR-218-5p expression was evaluated in 38 bone metastatic and 115 non-bone metastatic PCa tissues and serum samples. Clinical correlation of miR-218-5p expression with clinicopathological characteristics was analyzed. The biological roles of miR-218-5p in bone metastasis of PCa were investigated in vitro by invasion and migration assays. Bioinformatics analysis, real-time polymerase chain reaction, western blot, and luciferase reporter assay were applied to discern and examine the relationship between miR-218-5p and its potential targets.  Results:   miR-218-5p expression was reduced in bone metastatic PCa tissue and serum samples, which positively correlated with poor clinicopathological characteristics and bone metastasis-free survival in PCa patients. Upregulating miR-218-5p repressed PCa cell invasion and migration. Furthermore, miR-218-5p inhibited NF-κB signaling via simultaneously targeting TRAF1, TRAF2, and TRAF5, which suppressed the invasion and migration abilities of PCa cells.

To minimize the impact of this error on treatment, a tolerance value of a 1-mm mechanical isocenter shift is commonly accepted for intensity-modulated radiation therapy quality assurance (QA). However, this tolerance value has not been firmly established for volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) treatments. The purpose of this study is therefore to evaluate the impact of gantry and MLC carriage sag on VMAT clinical performance.  Methods:   A published dataset of Elekta and Varian sag measurements served as a starting point for the investigation. Typical sag profiles were chosen and modeled as continuous isocenter deviations in three dimensions. The data were then incorporated into existing Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine protocol, extended for radiotherapy plans via a ""beam-splitting"" algorithm. Three treatment sites were investigated in parallel: head and neck, prostate, and prostate with surrounding lymph nodes. Monte Carlo-simulated dose distributions were obtained for varying magnifications of the modeled sag. The resulting dose distributions, including that for no error, were compared qualitatively and quantitatively, against multiple metrics.  Results:   The dose-volume histograms (DVHs) for all plans exhibited a decrease in planning target volume (PTV) dose uniformity with increasing sag magnification, whereas dose to organs at risk exhibited no coherent trend. The prostate plan was shown to be the most vulnerable to mechanical sag across all considered metrics. However, all plans with peak isocenter deviation less than 1 mm were well within typical cutoff points for each metric.

Methods:   This was a prospective, randomized controlled clinical trial. Sixty-four patients with prostate cancer undergoing RARP were randomized to receive warmed and humidified CO2 insufflation with HumiGard device, plus hot air warming blanket (treatment group, H + WB), or standard CO2 insufflation, plus hot air warming blanket (control group, WB). Body core temperature (BCT), plasma levels of IL-6 and TNF-α, pain scores, and intraoperative parameters were recorded. The data were analyzed according to the Bayesian paradigm.  Results:   Intraoperative BCT increased in both groups during surgery, with a statistically significant difference favoring group H + WB, ending at 0.2°C higher on average than group WB. No difference across groups was shown for cytokine levels. Blood gas parameters were not affected by warmed CO2 insufflation. No statistical differences were noted for pain scores and the other intra- and postoperative parameters.  Conclusions:   During RARP, warm and humidified CO2 insufflation with the HumiGard device was more effective than the standard CO2 insufflation in maintaining the patient's heat homeostasis, even if the difference was minimal.

In our study, it was shown that the expression levels of PCAT19 was increased in laryngeal tumor tissues and associated with decreased overall survival. Using laryngeal cancer cells lines HEp-2 and AMC-HN-8, it was demonstrated that knockdown of PCAT19 decreased the cell proliferation, increased the mitochondrial respiration, and inhibited the glycolysis. In detail, it showed that the PDK4 expression and PDHE1α phosphorylation levels were decreased upon the PCAT19 knockdown. Further studies indicated that miR-182 functioned as the bridge between PCAT19 and PDK4, which could also regulate the cellular metabolism thus affecting the cell proliferation. Furthermore, it was shown that the PCAT19/miR-182/PDK4 axis existed and regulated cell proliferation by modulating glycolysis and mitochondrial respiration. Finally, we showed that the PCAT19 knockdown decreased the tumor growth in vivo, possibly through regulating the miR-182/PDK4 axis.

Results:   At a median follow-up of 52 months, 89 pts were alive, while 16 were dead. Total RT dose to macroscopic lesions was > 70 Gy in 58 pts, 66-70 Gy in 43, and < 66 Gy in 4 pts. In 72 pts, target volume encompassed only the prostatic bed with sequential boost to macroscopic site; 33 pts received prophylactic pelvic RT. Ten-year overall survival was 76.1%, while distant metastasis-free survival was 73.3%. No grade 4-5 toxicities were found.  Conclusions:   SRT ± ADT for macroscopic relapse showed a favorable oncological outcome supporting its important role in this scenario.

TRIM24 is also up-regulated from localized prostate cancer to metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Because of the high relevance of TRIM24 for cancer development and the universal expression of PSMA in CPRC, we investigated the efficacy of human monoclonal PSMA antibody (PSMAb)-based platform for the targeted TRIM24 siRNA delivery and its therapeutic efficacy in CRPC in vivo and in vitro. Methods: The therapeutic complexes were constructed by conjugating PSMAb and sulfo-SMCC-protamine, and encapsulating TRIM24 siRNA. Flow cytometry, immunofluorescence, and fluorescence imaging were performed to detect the receptor-binding, internalization, and targeted delivery of PSMAb-sulfo-SMCC-protamine (PSP)-FAM-siRNA complex (PSPS) in vitro and in vivo. CCK-8, plate-colony formation, apoptosis, cell cycle, and Transwell assays were performed to evaluate the therapeutic potential of the PSP-TRIM24 siRNA complex in vitro, whereas the in vivo therapeutic efficacy was monitored by small animal imaging, radiography, and micro CT. Results: We confirmed that PSP could efficiently protect siRNA from enzymatic digestion, enable targeted delivery of siRNA, and internalize and release siRNA into PSMA-positive (PSMA+) prostate cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. Silencing TRIM24 expression by the PSP-TRIM24 siRNA complex could dramatically suppress proliferation, colony-formation, and invasion of PSMA+ CRPC cells in vitro, and inhibit tumor growth of PSMA+ CRPC xenografts and bone loss in PSMA+ CRPC bone metastasis model without obvious toxicity at therapeutic doses in vivo.

ZFP91 mRNA expression was examined using Cancer Survey cDNA sets. Utilized cDNA samples represented 15 human organs and 17 cancer types. ZFP91 mRNA expression was the highest in the testes and lymph nodes. It was downregulated in testis cancer, lymphoma and thyroid cancer, and upregulated in prostate cancer. Among the analyzed cancer types, ZFP91 expression was markedly elevated in sarcomas and melanoma. On a protein level, a large-scale reverse phase protein array was employed providing samples from 11 organ types and from cancers derived from these organs. ZFP91 protein expression was revealed to be generally stable across the tested samples and was only moderately elevated in breast, ovarian and pancreatic cancers.

Of particular importance to prostate cancer is the ability to determine the aggressiveness of a primary tumour, which allows for effective management of patient care. In this work, we propose using gene vectors called tumour-activatable minicircles which deliver an exogenously encoded reporter gene into cancer cells, forcing them to produce a unique and sensitive biomarker. These minicircles express a blood reporter protein called secreted embryonic alkaline phosphatase mediated by the tumour-specific survivin promoter, which exhibits activity graded to prostate cancer aggressiveness. Together, these components underlie a detection system where levels of blood reporter are indicative of not only the presence, but also the metastatic potential of a tumour. Our goal was to assess the ability of tumour-activatable minicircles to detect and characterise primary prostate lesions. Our minicircles produced reporter levels related to survivin expression across a range of prostate cancer cell lines. When survivin-driven minicircles were administered intratumourally into mice, reporter levels in blood samples were significantly higher (p < 0.05) in mice carrying prostate tumours of high versus low-aggressiveness.

The vitamin D-regulated enzyme sterol-27-hydroxylase (CYP27A1) converts cholesterol to 27-hydroxycholesterol, potentially lowering intracellular cholesterol levels. We hypothesized that low CYP27A1 expression is associated with high cholesterol synthesis, low vitamin D signaling, and higher risk of lethal prostate cancer.  Methods:   In 404 patients from the prospective prostate cancer cohorts within the Health Professionals Follow-up Study (HPFS) and the Physicians' Health Study (PHS), we assessed intratumoral CYP27A1 expression and proxies of cholesterol synthesis using transcriptome profiling, prediagnostic plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D; n = 132], and intratumoral vitamin D receptor protein expression (VDR; n = 300). Patients were followed for metastases and prostate cancer mortality (lethal cancer; median follow-up, 15.3 years).  Results: CYP27A1 expression was lower in tumors with higher Gleason grade and higher expression of cholesterol synthesis enzymes, including the second rate-limiting enzyme, SQLE. We did not detect consistent associations between CYP27A1 and 25(OH)D, VDR, or CYP24A1 mRNA expression. Lower CYP27A1 was associated with higher risk of lethal cancer in both cohorts, independent of SQLE [adjusted OR for lowest vs. highest quartile of CYP27A1, 2.64; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.24-5.62]. This association was attenuated when additionally adjusting for Gleason grade (OR, 1.76; 95% CI, 0.75-4.17).

Here, all eight hypermethylated candidates showed high sensitivity (75⁻94%) and specificity (84⁻100%) for PCa. Furthermore, DOCK2, GRASP, HIF3A and PKFP hypermethylation was significantly associated with biochemical recurrence (BCR) after radical prostatectomy (RP; 197 patients), independent of the routine clinicopathological variables. DOCK2 is the most promising single candidate marker (hazard ratio (HR) (95% confidence interval (CI)): 1.96 (1.24⁻3.10), adjusted p = 0.016; multivariate cox regression). Further validation studies are warranted and should investigate the potential value of these hypermethylation candidate markers for blood-based testing also.""","""['Marianne T Bjerre', 'Siri H Strand', 'Maibritt Nørgaard', 'Helle Kristensen', 'Anne Ki Rasmussen', 'Martin Mørck Mortensen', 'Jacob Fredsøe', 'Peter Mouritzen', 'Benedicte Ulhøi', 'Torben Ørntoft', 'Michael Borre', 'Karina D Sørensen']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Int J Mol Sci""","""['RHCG and TCAF1 promoter hypermethylation predicts biochemical recurrence in prostate cancer patients treated by radical prostatectomy.', 'Epigenetic silencing of MEIS2 in prostate cancer recurrence.', 'Epigenetic Analysis of Circulating Tumor DNA in Localized and Metastatic Prostate Cancer: Evaluation of Clinical Biomarker Potential.', 'The epigenetics of prostate cancer diagnosis and prognosis: update on clinical applications.', 'DNA methylation changes in prostate cancer: current developments and future clinical implementation.', 'FBXO30 functions as a tumor suppressor and an E3 ubiquitin ligase for hZIP1‑mediated HIF‑1α degradation in renal cell carcinoma.', 'Expression analysis of HIF-3α as a potent prognostic biomarker in various types of human cancers: a case of meta-analysis.', 'Construction of cuproptosis-related lncRNAs/mRNAs model and prognostic prediction of hepatocellular carcinoma.', 'DNA Methylation Changes in Autologous Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant Patients.', 'Insights from DOCK2 in cell function and pathophysiology.']"""

Recently, γ-T3 was found to target cancer stem cells (CSCs), leading to suppression of tumour formation and chemosensitisation. Despite its promising anti-cancer potential, the exact mechanisms responsible for the effects of γ-T3 are still largely unknown. Here, we report the identification of Ang-1 (Angiopoietin-1)/Tie-2 as a novel γ-T3 downstream target. In prostate cancer cells, γ-T3 treatment leads to the suppression of Ang-1 at both the mRNA transcript and protein levels. Supplementing the cells with Ang-1 was found to protect them against the anti-CSC effect of γ-T3. Intriguingly, inactivation of Tie-2, a member receptor that mediates the effect of Ang-1, was found to significantly enhance the cytotoxic effect of γ-T3 through activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and subsequent interruption of autophagy. Our results highlighted the therapeutic potential of using γ-T3 in combination with a Tie-2 inhibitor to treat advanced prostate cancer.""","""['Kai Dun Tang', 'Ji Liu', 'Pamela J Russell', 'Judith A Clements', 'Ming-Tat Ling']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Int J Mol Sci""","""['Gamma-tocotrienol as an effective agent in targeting prostate cancer stem cell-like population.', 'Gamma-tocotrienol suppresses prostate cancer cell proliferation and invasion through multiple-signalling pathways.', 'Beta-Tocotrienol Exhibits More Cytotoxic Effects than Gamma-Tocotrienol on Breast Cancer Cells by Promoting Apoptosis via a P53-Independent PI3-Kinase Dependent Pathway.', 'Activation of autophagy and AMPK by gamma-tocotrienol suppresses the adipogenesis in human adipose derived stem cells.', 'Tie-1: A potential target for anti-angiogenesis therapy.', 'Tocotrienol-rich fraction reduces retinal inflammation and angiogenesis in rats with streptozotocin-induced diabetes.', 'Necroptosis Induced by Delta-Tocotrienol Overcomes Docetaxel Chemoresistance in Prostate Cancer Cells.', 'Recent advance of herbal medicines in cancer- a molecular approach.', 'Vitamin E Intake and Risk of Prostate Cancer: A Meta-Analysis.', 'Transcriptomic Analysis of the Anticancer Effects of Annatto Tocotrienol, Delta-Tocotrienol and Gamma-Tocotrienol on Chondrosarcoma Cells.']"""

The aim of this study was to explore factors related to self-rated health and life satisfaction for patients treated for prostate cancer, and to compare the results of these generic quality-of-life measures to the prostate cancer-specific quality-of-life measure (UCLA Prostate Cancer Index), which focuses on physical functioning.  Material and methods:   This cross-sectional survey was carried out among 183 men who underwent radical prostatectomy in 2012-2015 at a university hospital in Finland and were seen 1 year postsurgery. Approval from an ethics committee and written consents from participants were received. A questionnaire was used to evaluate patients' perceived quality of life. Logistic regression model, Spearman's correlation, Kruskal-Wallis test and Mann-Whitney U-test were used to analyse factors related to quality of life.  Results:   Of the 183 men in the study, 63% rated their health status as good, and 70% were satisfied with their lives after prostatectomy. Older age and better urinary function were the only factors that explained both better self-rated health and better satisfaction with life. The patients seemed not to interpret problems with sexual function as health-related problems. In our sample, sexual dysfunction was relatively severe, but patients considered them to be less harmful than urinary or bowel symptoms. Interestingly, 24% of the men with low sexual function did not find that dysfunction bothersome.  Conclusions:   Objectively measured physical functioning is not necessarily in line with patients' experienced satisfaction with life and their self-ratings of health. More longitudinal and qualitative research is needed about the meanings that patients attach to physical treatment side effects and the extent to which they can adapt to them over time. With a bigger sample and longer follow-up time, it would be possible to identify men who particularly benefited from pretreatment counselling.""","""['Anna-Maija Talvitie', 'Hanna Ojala', 'Teuvo Tammela', 'Anna-Maija Koivisto', 'Ilkka Pietilä']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Scand J Caring Sci""","""['Quality of Life, Psychological Functioning, and Treatment Satisfaction of Men Who Have Undergone Penile Prosthesis Surgery Following Robot-Assisted Radical Prostatectomy.', 'Health-related quality of life and satisfaction with care among older men treated for prostate cancer with either radical prostatectomy or external beam radiation therapy.', 'Quality of life and satisfaction with information after radical prostatectomy, radical external beam radiotherapy and postoperative radiotherapy: a long-term follow-up study.', 'Patient-reported outcome (PRO) questionnaires for men who have radical surgery for prostate cancer: a conceptual review of existing instruments.', 'The effect of androgen deprivation therapy on health-related quality of life in men with prostate cancer.', 'Efficacy, Use, and Acceptability of a Web-Based Self-management Intervention Designed to Maximize Sexual Well-being in Men Living With Prostate Cancer: Single-Arm Experimental Study.', 'Quality of life in urologic cancer patients: importance of and satisfaction with specific quality of life domains.', 'The Tablet-Based, Engagement, Assessment, Support, and Sign-Posting (EASSi) Tool for Facilitating and Structuring Sexual Well-Being Conversations in Routine Prostate Cancer Care: Mixed-Methods Study.']"""

Given that previous reports suggested that circulating tumor cell (CTC) AR-V7 detection is a poor prognostic indicator for the clinical efficacy of secondary hormone therapies, we conducted a prospective multicenter validation study.  Patients and methods:   PROPHECY ( ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02269982) is a multicenter, prospective-blinded study of men with high-risk mCRPC starting abiraterone acetate or enzalutamide treatment. The primary objective was to validate the prognostic significance of baseline CTC AR-V7 on the basis of radiographic or clinical progression free-survival (PFS) by using the Johns Hopkins University modified-AdnaTest CTC AR-V7 mRNA assay and the Epic Sciences CTC nuclear-specific AR-V7 protein assay. Overall survival (OS) and prostate-specific antigen responses were secondary end points.  Results:   We enrolled 118 men with mCRPC who were starting abiraterone or enzalutamide treatment. AR-V7 detection by both the Johns Hopkins and Epic AR-V7 assays was independently associated with shorter PFS (hazard ratio, 1.9 [95% CI, 1.1 to 3.3; P = .032] and 2.4 [95% CI, 1.1 to 5.1; P = .020], respectively) and OS (hazard ratio, 4.2 [95% CI, 2.1 to 8.5] and 3.5 [95% CI, 1.6 to 8.1], respectively) after adjusting for CTC number and clinical prognostic factors. Men with AR-V7-positive mCRPC had fewer confirmed prostate-specific antigen responses (0% to 11%) or soft tissue responses (0% to 6%). The observed percentage agreement between the two AR-V7 assays was 82%.  Conclusion:   Detection of AR-V7 in CTCs by two blood-based assays is independently associated with shorter PFS and OS with abiraterone or enzalutamide, and such men with mCRPC should be offered alternative treatments.""","""['Andrew J Armstrong', 'Susan Halabi', 'Jun Luo', 'David M Nanus', 'Paraskevi Giannakakou', 'Russell Z Szmulewitz', 'Daniel C Danila', 'Patrick Healy', 'Monika Anand', 'Colin J Rothwell', 'Julia Rasmussen', 'Blair Thornburg', 'William R Berry', 'Rhonda S Wilder', 'Changxue Lu', 'Yan Chen', 'John L Silberstein', 'Gabor Kemeny', 'Giuseppe Galletti', 'Jason A Somarelli', 'Santosh Gupta', 'Simon G Gregory', 'Howard I Scher', 'Ryan Dittamore', 'Scott T Tagawa', 'Emmanuel S Antonarakis', 'Daniel J George']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""J Clin Oncol""","""['Reply to L.

However, next generation sequencing (NGS) of cell-free DNA (cfDNA) may not be appropriate for all patients with advanced prostate cancer (PC).  Methods:   Blood was obtained from advanced PC patients for plasma-based sequencing. UW-OncoPlex, a ∼2 Mb multi-gene NGS panel performed in the CLIA/CAP environment, was optimized for detecting cfDNA mutations. Tumor tissue and germline samples were sequenced for comparative analyses. Multivariate logistic regression was performed to determine the clinical characteristic associated with the successful detection of somatic cfDNA alterations (ie detection of at least one clearly somatic PC mutation).  Results:   Plasma for cfDNA sequencing was obtained from 93 PC patients along with tumor tissue (N = 67) and germline (N = 93) controls. We included data from 76 patients (72 prostate adenocarcinoma; 4 variant histology PC) in the analysis. Somatic DNA aberrations were detected in 34 cfDNA samples from patients with prostate adenocarcinoma. High PSA level, high tumor volume, and castration-resistance were significantly associated with successful detection of somatic cfDNA alterations. Among samples with somatic mutations detected, the cfDNA assay detected 93/102 (91%) alterations found in tumor tissue, yielding a clustering-corrected sensitivity of 92% (95% confidence interval 88-97%). All germline pathogenic variants present in lymphocyte DNA were also detected in cfDNA (N = 12). Somatic mutations from cfDNA were detected in 30/33 (93%) instances when PSA was >10 ng/mL.

We reviewed preoperative demographics, stricture etiology, previous management and patient outcomes.  Results:   We identified 13 patients from April 2013 to June 2017. Median age at surgery was 54 years. The stricture etiology was lichen sclerosus in 6 of 13 patients (46%), idiopathic in 2 (15%), hypospadias in 1 (7%), prior gender confirming surgery in 3 (23%) and rectourethral fistula after radiation for prostate cancer in 1 (7%). Prior procedures included failed urethroplasty with a buccal mucosa graft in 9 of 13 patients (69%), direct vision internal urethrotomy in 2 (15%) and none in 2 (15%). Median stricture length was 13 cm. Stricture location in the 9 cisgender patients was panurethral in 5 (56%), bulbopendulous in 2 (22%) and bulbar in 2 (22%). It was located at the junction of the fixed urethra extending into the neophallus in all 3 patients (100%) who underwent prior gender confirming surgery. Mean rectal mucosa graft length for urethroplasty was 10.6 cm (range 3 to 16). Repair types included dorsal or ventral onlay, or 2-stage repair. Stricture recurred at a median followup of 13.5 months in 2 of 13 patients (15%). Postoperative complications included glans dehiscence, urethrocutaneous fistula and compartment syndrome in 1 patient each (7%). No rectal or bowel related complications were reported.

The aim of the present study was to compare two cohorts of patients treated with moderate hypofractionation (MHRT) or stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT).  Methods:   We included patients treated between 2010 and 2015. Inclusion criteria were: adenocarcinoma of the prostate; class risks low or intermediate; WHO performance status 0-2. We evaluated rectal, gastrointestinal toxicity and genitourinary. Measures of outcome were biochemical disease-free survival and overall survival. Propensity score was used to approximate the balance in covariates.  Results:   209 patients were included, treated with MHRT (n = 109) or SBRT (n = 100). Median follow-up time was 37.4 months. Rates of biochemical disease-free survival at 1- and 3 years were 100 and 95%, respectively. There was no significant difference between the two groups (p = 0.868). Rates of overall survival at 1- and 3 years were 100 and 97.1%, respectively with no differences between the two groups (p = 0.312). After propensity scoring matching, no differences were observed in terms of acute and late rectal and gastrointestinal toxicity. While mild genitourinary side-effects were more common in SBRT group (45.5% vs 19.5 %), Grade 2 and 3 toxicity was increased after MHRT (11.7% vs 2.6 %; p = 0.029).  Conclusions:   Moderate hypofractionation and SBRT are two effective and safe options for the treatment of low- and intermediate-risk prostate cancer. The analysis showed no difference in terms of disease's control and survival but increased moderate and severe toxicity after MHRT.  Advances in knowledge:   Moderate hypofractionation and SBRT are comparable in terms of efficacy while moderate and severe toxicity is more common in the first one.""","""['Ciro Franzese', ""Giuseppe D'agostino"", 'Lucia Di Brina', 'Pierina Navarria', 'Fiorenza De Rose', 'Tiziana Comito', 'Davide Franceschini', 'Pietro Mancosu', 'Stefano Tomatis', 'Marta Scorsetti']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Br J Radiol""","""['Hypofractionated versus conventionally fractionated radiotherapy for patients with prostate cancer (HYPRO): acute toxicity results from a randomised non-inferiority phase 3 trial.', 'Moderately HRT vs. CRT for localized prostate cancer using image-guided VMAT with SIB: evaluation of acute and late toxicities.', 'Intensity-modulated fractionated radiotherapy versus stereotactic body radiotherapy for prostate cancer (PACE-B): acute toxicity findings from an international, randomised, open-label, phase 3, non-inferiority trial.', 'Rectal/urinary toxicity after hypofractionated vs conventional radiotherapy in low/intermediate risk localized prostate cancer: systematic review and meta analysis.', 'Rectal/urinary toxicity after hypofractionated vs. conventional radiotherapy in high risk prostate cancer: systematic review and meta analysis.', 'Linac-based versus MR-guided SBRT for localized prostate cancer: a comparative evaluation of acute tolerability.', 'Phase II study of stereotactic body radiotherapy with hydrogel spacer for prostate cancer: acute toxicity and propensity score-matched comparison.']"""

Phospholipase Cε (PLCε), an oncogene, has been found to be involved in the carcinogenesis, tumor proliferation and migration of several types of cancer. The effects, however, of PLCε on CRPC remains unclear. In the present study, the expression of PLCε and glioma‑associated homolog (Gli)‑1/Gli‑2 in benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), PCa and CRPC tissues and cells was investigated, and the correlations between PLCε and Gli‑1/Gli‑2 in CRPC tissues and cell lines were further explored. In addition, the effect of PLCε on cell proliferation and invasion was assessed in CRPC cell lines, and the sensitivity of EN‑R and 22RV1 cells to enzalutamide following the downregulation of PLCε expression was determined using lentivirus‑mediated shPLCε and/or treatment with specific Gli inhibitor GANT61. It was found that the PLCε expression was excessively upregulated in the majority of CRPC tissues, and PLCε positivity was linked to poor progression‑free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in patients with PCa. Furthermore, PLCε knockdown significantly suppressed CRPC cell proliferation and invasion. Of note, it was found that PLCε knockdown increased the sensitivity of CRPC cells to enzalutamide in vitro by suppressing androgen receptor (AR) activities via the non‑canonical Hedgehog/Gli‑2 and p‑STAT3 signaling pathways. PLCε knockdown was shown to increase the sensitivity of CRPC cell xenografts to enzalutamide in vivo. Finally, the combination of PLCε knockdown with GANT61 significantly sensitized CRPC cells to enzalutamide. Collectively, the results of the present study suggest that PLCε is a potential therapeutic target for CRPC.""","""['Wei Sun', 'Luo Li', 'Zhongbo Du', 'Zhen Quan', 'Mengjuan Yuan', 'Honglin Cheng', 'Yingying Gao', 'Chunli Luo', 'Xiaohou Wu']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Oncol Rep""","""['Corrigendum Combination of phospholipase Cε knockdown with GANT61 sensitizes castration‑resistant prostate cancer cells to enzalutamide by suppressing the androgen receptor signaling pathway.', 'PLCε knockdown enhances the radiosensitivity of castration‑resistant prostate cancer via the AR/PARP1/DNA‑PKcs axis.', 'Gli2 mediates the development of castration‑resistant prostate cancer.', 'Histone acetyltransferase 1 upregulates androgen receptor expression to modulate CRPC cell resistance to enzalutamide.', 'Targeting persistent androgen receptor signaling in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Enzalutamide: targeting the androgen signalling pathway in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Antiandrogen-Equipped Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors Selectively Inhibit Androgen Receptor (AR) and AR-Splice Variant (AR-SV) in Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer (CRPC).', 'Anti-Cancer Stem-Cell-Targeted Therapies in Prostate Cancer.', 'Resveratrol inhibits TRAF6/PTCH/SMO signal and regulates prostate cancer progression.', 'GANT61 exerts anticancer cell and anticancer stem cell capacity in colorectal cancer by blocking the Wnt/β‑catenin and Notch signalling pathways.', 'Metformin mitigates PLCε gene expression and modulates the Notch1/Hes and androgen receptor signaling pathways in castration-resistant prostate cancer xenograft models.']"""

In the present study, the role of ERβ in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)‑induced inflammation and association with NF‑κB activity were investigated in PC‑3 and DU145 prostate cancer cell lines. Cells were treated with LPS to induce inflammation, and ELISA was performed to determine the expression levels of inflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor‑α (TNF‑α), monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP‑1), interleukin (IL)‑1β and IL‑6. MTT and Transwell assays, and Annexin V/propidium iodide staining were conducted to measure cell viability, apoptosis and migration, respectively. Protein expression was determined via western blot analysis. LPS‑induced inflammation resulted in elevated expression levels of TNF‑α, IL‑1β, MCP‑1 and IL‑6 compared with controls. ERβ overexpression significantly inhibited the LPS‑induced production of TNF‑α, IL‑1β, MCP‑1 and IL‑6. In addition, the results indicated that ERβ suppressed viability and migration, and induced apoptosis in prostate cancer cells, which was further demonstrated by altered expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen, B‑cell lymphoma 2‑associated X protein, caspase‑3, E‑cadherin and matrix metalloproteinase‑2. These effects were reversed by treatment with the ERβ antagonist PHTPP or ERβ‑specific short interfering RNA. ERβ overexpression reduced the expression levels of p65 and phosphorylated NF‑κB inhibitor α (IκBα), but not total IκBα expression in LPS‑treated cells. In conclusion, ERβ suppressed the viability and migration of the PC‑3 and DU145 prostate cancer cell lines and induced apoptosis.

The mRNA and protein expression levels of epithelial (E)‑cadherin, vimentin, α‑smooth muscle actin (α‑SMA), cyclin D1 and MYC proto‑oncogene protein (c‑Myc) were analyzed by RT‑qPCR and western blot analysis. In the present study, the mRNA and protein levels of URG11 were markedly upregulated in Pca cell lines compared with those in the normal prostate epithelial cell line. With functional experiments, the cell viability, migration and invasion of Pca cells were markedly promoted by URG11 overexpression. The cell cycle was effectively induced by URG11 and apoptosis was inhibited by the overexpression of URG11. Concomitantly, the epithelial marker E‑cadherin was downregulated, and the mesenchymal markers vimentin and α‑SMA were upregulated following URG11 overexpression. By contrast, genetic knockout of URG11 elicited the opposite effects. The present study also identified that the downstream effector genes of the Wnt/β‑catenin signal pathway, cyclin D1 and c‑Myc, were increased following the overexpression of endogenous URG11, which are known to regulate cell proliferation. In addition, the Wnt/β‑catenin inhibitor FH535 ameliorated the promotive effects of URG11 on LNCaP cells viability, migration and invasion, and the Wnt/β‑catenin agonist LiCl reversed the inhibitory effects of siURG11 in LNCaP cells on cell viability, migration and invasion.

Methods:   Using the national population-based French cross-sectional study Vie après le cancer 2, we included 1984 patients with early breast (61.1%), prostate (21.5%), and colorectal (17.4%) cancer. Severe fatigue at 2 years postdiagnosis was defined by a score ≥40 in the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer quality of life questionnaire (EORTC QLQ C30) fatigue subscale. PA was defined as (a) self-reported PA before diagnosis (active/inactive) and (b) change in PA since diagnosis (increased/maintained exposure vs decreased exposure/remaining inactive). Multivariate regression examined associations of severe fatigue with PA, adjusting for baseline clinical and treatment variables.  Results:   Median age was 52 years. 51.5% of patients experienced severe fatigue 2 years post-diagnosis. 87.7% reported to be physically active before cancer diagnosis; 53.3% of patients either decreased PA or remained inactive at 2 years postdiagnosis. At 2 years postdiagnosis, severe fatigue was associated with a change in PA since diagnosis: patients with decreasing PA/remaining inactive from pre- to postdiagnosis had a higher risk of severe fatigue vs those with increasing/maintaining PA (adjusted odds ratio [95% confidence interval] 2.32 [1.85-2.90]).

Robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (RALRP) using the da Vinci surgical robot has become the gold-standard treatment for organ-confined prostate cancer. To improve intraoperative visualization of anatomical structures, many groups have developed techniques integrating transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) into the surgical workflow. TRUS, however, is intrusive and does not provide real-time volumetric imaging.  Methods:   We propose a proof-of-concept system offering an alternative noninvasive transperineal view of the prostate and surrounding structures using 3D ultrasound (US), allowing for full-volume imaging in any anatomical plane desired. The system aims to automatically track da Vinci surgical instruments and display a real-time US image registered to preoperative MRI. We evaluate the approach using a custom prostate phantom, an iU22 (Philips Healthcare, Bothell, WA) US machine with an xMATRIX X6-1 transducer, and a custom probe fixture. A novel registration method between the da Vinci kinematic frame and 3D US is presented. To evaluate the entire registration pipeline, we use a previously developed MRI to US deformable registration algorithm.  Results:   Our US calibration technique yielded a registration error of 0.84 mm, compared to 1.76 mm with existing methods. We evaluated overall system error with a prostate phantom, achieving a target registration error of 2.55 mm.  Conclusion:   Transperineal imaging using 3D US is a promising approach for image guidance during RALRP. Preliminary results suggest this system is comparable to existing guidance systems using TRUS.

Currently, the exact role of the TSPX CAD in transcriptional regulation of downstream genes is still uncertain. Using different variants of TSPX, we showed that overexpression of either TSPX, that harbors a CAD, or a CAD-truncated variant (TSPX[∆C]) drastically retarded cell proliferation in a prostate cancer cell line LNCaP, but cell death was induced only by overexpression of TSPX.

Materials and methods:   Human PCa samples and their matched normal adjacent tissues were obtained from 26 patients to assess the expression of circHIPK3 and its relationship with PCa prognosis. A series of in vitro and in vivo functional experiments were carried out to elucidate the role of circHIPK3 in PCa progression and its underlying molecular mechanisms.  Results:   In this study, we found that circHIPK3 was overexpressed in PCa tissues and that higher circHIPK3 expression was associated with tumor stage. Moreover, circHIPK3 knockdown markedly inhibited the proliferation, migration, and invasion of PCa cells in vitro and impaired tumor growth in vivo.

Downregulation of E-cadherin is a hallmark of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and correlates with poor prognosis in multiple carcinomas. Conversely, upregulation of E-cadherin is prognostic for improved survival in sarcomas. Yet, despite the prognostic benefit of E-cadherin expression in sarcoma, the mechanistic significance of E-cadherin in sarcomas remains poorly understood. Here, by combining mathematical models with wet-bench experiments, we identify the core regulatory networks mediated by E-cadherin in sarcomas, and decipher their functional consequences. Unlike carcinomas, E-cadherin overexpression in sarcomas does not induce a mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition (MET). However, E-cadherin acts to reduce both anchorage-independent growth and spheroid formation of sarcoma cells. Ectopic E-cadherin expression acts to downregulate phosphorylated CREB1 (p-CREB) and the transcription factor, TBX2, to inhibit anchorage-independent growth. RNAi-mediated knockdown of TBX2 phenocopies the effect of E-cadherin on CREB levels and restores sensitivity to anchorage-independent growth in sarcoma cells. Beyond its signaling role, E-cadherin expression in sarcoma cells can also strengthen cell-cell adhesion and restricts spheroid growth through mechanical action. Together, our results demonstrate that E-cadherin inhibits sarcoma aggressiveness by preventing anchorage-independent growth. IMPLICATIONS: We highlight how E-cadherin can restrict aggressive behavior in sarcomas through both biochemical signaling and biomechanical effects.""","""['Mohit Kumar Jolly#', 'Kathryn E Ware#', 'Shengnan Xu', 'Shivee Gilja', 'Samantha Shetler', 'Yanjun Yang', 'Xueyang Wang', 'R Garland Austin', 'Daniella Runyambo', 'Alexander J Hish', 'Suzanne Bartholf DeWitt', 'Jason T George', 'R Timothy Kreulen', 'Mary-Keara Boss', 'Alexander L Lazarides', 'David L Kerr', 'Drew G Gerber', 'Dharshan Sivaraj', 'Andrew J Armstrong', 'Mark W Dewhirst', 'William C Eward', 'Herbert Levine', 'Jason A Somarelli']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Mol Cancer Res""","""['Cadherin profiling for therapeutic interventions in Epithelial Mesenchymal Transition (EMT) and tumorigenesis.', 'The Anoikis Effector Bit1 Inhibits EMT through Attenuation of TLE1-Mediated Repression of E-Cadherin in Lung Cancer Cells.', 'A Ca2+-ATPase Regulates E-cadherin Biogenesis and Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition in Breast Cancer Cells.', 'CHIP functions as an oncogene by promoting colorectal cancer metastasis via activation of MAPK and AKT signaling and suppression of E-cadherin.', 'A central role for cadherin signaling in cancer.', 'Role of Nudt2 in Anchorage-Independent Growth and Cell Migration of Human Melanoma.', 'Semaphorin 3F induces colorectal cancer cell chemosensitivity by promoting P27 nuclear export.', 'Mapping phenotypic heterogeneity in melanoma onto the epithelial-hybrid-mesenchymal axis.', 'Novel Targeted Therapeutic Strategies for Ewing Sarcoma.', 'Tumor and Peripheral Immune Status in Soft Tissue Sarcoma: Implications for Immunotherapy.']"""

This study aimed to test the hypothesis that patients with prostate cancer with intermediate- or high-risk disease undergoing extreme dose escalation with a brachytherapy boost are less likely to receive ADT.  Methods and materials:   Data from the National Cancer Database were extracted for men aged 40-90 years diagnosed with node-negative, non-metastatic prostate cancer from 2004 to 2015. Only patients with intermediate- or high-risk disease who were treated with definitive radiotherapy were included. The association and patterns of care between dose escalated radiotherapy and ADT receipt were assessed using multivariable logistic regression.  Results:   Patients with unfavorable intermediate- and high-risk prostate cancer were significantly less likely to receive ADT if they underwent dose escalation with a combination of EBRT and brachytherapy (odds ratio 0.67, p < 0.0001). Over time, this decrease in ADT utilization has widened for patients with unfavorable intermediate-risk disease. There was no difference in ADT utilization when comparing patients treated with non-dose-escalated EBRT to those treated with dose-escalated EBRT (without brachytherapy).  Conclusion:   In this large national database, patients with unfavorable intermediate- and high-risk prostate cancer were significantly less likely to receive guideline-indicated ADT if they underwent extreme dose escalation with combined radiation modalities. As we await prospective data guiding the utility of ADT with dose escalated radiation, these findings suggest potential underutilization of ADT in patients at higher risk of advanced disease.""","""['Jahan J Mohiuddin', 'Vivek Narayan', 'Sriram Venigalla', 'Neha Vapiwala']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Brachytherapy""","""['Evaluation of the effectiveness of adding androgen deprivation to modern dose-escalated radiotherapy for men with favorable intermediate-risk prostate cancer.', 'Factors associated with the omission of androgen deprivation therapy in radiation-managed high-risk prostate cancer.', 'Survival outcomes of radiotherapy with or without androgen-deprivation therapy for patients with intermediate-risk prostate cancer using the National Cancer Data Base.', 'American Brachytherapy Society Task Group Report: Use of androgen deprivation therapy with prostate brachytherapy-A systematic literature review.', 'American Brachytherapy Society Task Group Report: Combination of brachytherapy and external beam radiation for high-risk prostate cancer.', 'Assessing the toxicity after moderately hypofractionated prostate and whole pelvis radiotherapy compared to conventional fractionation.', 'Suboptimal use of hormonal therapy among German men with localized high-risk prostate Cancer during 2005 to 2015: analysis of registry data.', 'Addition of Androgen-Deprivation Therapy or Brachytherapy Boost to External Beam Radiotherapy for Localized Prostate Cancer: A Network Meta-Analysis of Randomized Trials.', 'Combined Modality Therapies for High-Risk Prostate Cancer: Narrative Review of Current Understanding and New Directions.']"""

The aims of the present study were to: (1) compare the level of fatigue and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) of cancer survivors admitted to a one-week inpatient educational program (IEP) to the general population (NORMS), (2) examine changes in fatigue, HRQOL and physical activity after the IEP and (3) examine the proportions of survivors for female and male separately with clinically relevant improvement (>10% of maximum scale). Methods: Cancer survivors ≥18 years, diagnosed with breast-, prostate- or gastrointestinal cancer within the last 10 years, about to attend a one-week IEP were invited to an observational study with a pre-post design. The IEP included lectures, group discussions and physical activity. The participants completed a questionnaire on the arrival day (T0) and three months after the stay (T1). Fatigue was assessed by the Fatigue Questionnaire and HRQOL by Short Form-36. Results: Compared to NORMS, both female and male participants had significantly higher mean levels of fatigue and poorer HRQOL at T0 and T1. From T0 to T1, among all participants physical fatigue was reduced from 12.6 (SD 3.9) to 11.8 (SD 3.8; p < .001), mental fatigue from 6.3 (SD 2.2) to 6.0 (SD 2.2; p = .044) and total fatigue from 19.0 (SD 5.3) to 17.8 (SD 5.4; p = .001). Among female participants, 30% experienced clinically relevant improvement in physical fatigue, 28% in total fatigue and 36% in general health. Of male participants, 31% displayed a clinically relevant improvement in role limitations physical.

It is also impractical to generate all possible treatment plans based on available radiotherapy techniques and select the best option for a specific patient. Automatic dose prediction will be very helpful in these situations, while there were a few studies of three-dimensional (3D) dose prediction for patients who received radiotherapy. The purpose of this work was to develop a novel atlas-based method to predict 3D dose prediction and to evaluate its performance. Previously treated nineteen left-sided post-mastectomy breast cancer patients and sixteen prostate cancer patients were included in this study. One patient was arbitrarily chosen as the reference for each type of cancer and all the remaining patients' computed tomography (CT) images and contours were aligned to it using deformable image registration (DIR). Deformable vector field (DVF) for each patient i (DVF i-ref) was used to deform the original 3D dose matrix of that patient. CT scan of a test patient was also registered with the same reference patient using DIR and both direct DVF (DVFtest-ref) and inverse DVF ([Formula: see text]) were derived. Similarity of atlas patients to the test patient was determined based on the similarity of DVFtest-ref to atlas DVFs (DVF i-ref) and appropriate weighting factors were calculated. Patients' doses in the atlas were deformed again using [Formula: see text] to transform them from the reference patient's coordinates to the test patient's coordinates and the final 3D dose distribution for the test patient was predicted by summing the weighted individual 3D dose distributions. Performance of our method was evaluated and the results revealed that the proposed method was able to predict the 3D dose distributions accurately. The mean dose difference between clinical and predicted 3D dose distributions were 0.9 ± 1.1 Gy and 1.9 ± 1.2 Gy for breast and prostate plans. The proposed dose prediction method can be used to improve planning quality and facilitate plan comparisons.""","""['S A Yoganathan', 'Rui Zhang']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Phys Med Biol""","""['Radiotherapy dose distribution prediction for breast cancer using deformable image registration.', 'MR image-based synthetic CT for IMRT prostate treatment planning and CBCT image-guided localization.', 'Investigating the generalisation of an atlas-based synthetic-CT algorithm to another centre and MR scanner for prostate MR-only radiotherapy.', 'Use of deformed intensity distributions for on-line modification of image-guided IMRT to account for interfractional anatomic changes.', 'Assessing cumulative dose distributions in combined radiotherapy for cervical cancer using deformable image registration with pre-imaging preparations.', 'Accuracy Improvement Method Based on Characteristic Database Classification for IMRT Dose Prediction in Cervical Cancer: Scientifically Training Data Selection.', 'Sharp loss: a new loss function for radiotherapy dose prediction based on fully convolutional networks.', 'Deep learning method for prediction of patient-specific dose distribution in breast cancer.', 'Radiotherapy dose distribution prediction for breast cancer using deformable image registration.']"""

Patients with multiple cancers are not easy to manage and it is difficult to find the appropriate approach and resources to use with them. We focused our attention on how to choose the correct strategy to face 2 different neoplasms and control the adverse reactions related to the corresponding treatments.  Patient concerns:   We present a case of a 71-year-old man who came to us complaining about an abnormal difficulty in urinating associated with an interrupted flow and excessive urination at night. Clinical examination detected multiple enlarged superior and inferior diaphragmatic lymph nodes.  Diagnosis:   Prostate biopsy revealed an acinar adenocarcinoma (Gleason 4+3, Grade group 3). Clinical staging by bone scan was negative but computed tomography scan (CT) detected multiple enlarged superior and inferior diaphragmatic, and inguinal lymph nodes. This type of lymph node involvement pattern is unusual for an acinar adenocarcinoma prostate cancer therefore we suspected the simultaneous presence of a lymphatic neoplasm. Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography scan. The exam showed one of the left inguinal lymph nodes had the highest standardized uptake value (13.0) so a biopsy was taken. The sample analysis confirmed the diagnosis of a follicular non-Hodgkin lymphoma of Grade 3a.  Interventions:   We used a multidisciplinary clinical approach based on Rituximab+CHOP administered every 21 days. Simultaneously, the patient underwent androgen deprivation therapy with triptorelin monthly and bicalutamide administered just during the first month of treatment. When we obtained a complete response for the lymphoma, the patient continued the therapy with Rituximab once every 2 months for the next 2 years. Then we added volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) radiotherapy with simultaneous integrated boost (SIB) to androgen deprivation therapy for the duration of 1 month.  Outcomes:   After 1 year and 6 months since the conclusion of therapy for prostate cancer and Follicular lymphoma, patient's conditions are good and he is in complete remission for both diseases. Gut toxicity is reduced with a mean number of 2 to 3 discharges daily and an increased body weight.  Lessons:   The presence of diffuse lymphadenopathy and urinary symptoms in the same patients must induce the suspect of 2 contemporary cancer diseases. Parallel treatments of follicular lymphoma and prostate cancer should consider the increased risk of severe adverse effects related to the treatment and their management. We describe our therapeutic strategy to highlight the importance to balance benefits and disadvantages to get the best possible response and maintain a good quality of life in this complex setting.""","""['Angelo Pirozzi', 'Giacomo Cartenì', 'Sarah Scagliarini', 'Mario Fusco', 'Ferdinando Riccardi']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Medicine (Baltimore)""","""[""Successful treatment of concomitant metastatic prostate cancer and B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma with R-EPOCH chemotherapy regimen and antiandrogen therapy."", 'Synchronous papillary thyroid cancer and non-Hodgkin lymphoma: Case report.', ""False-positive FDG-PET findings due to bone metastasis from prostate cancer in staging of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma."", ""Rituximab: a review of its use in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukaemia."", 'Bilateral primary renal lymphoma in a pediatric patient: staging and response evaluation with ¹⁸F-FDG PET/CT.', 'Phosphodiesterase SMPDL3B Gene Expression as Independent Outcome Prediction Marker in Localized Prostate Cancer.']"""

Methods: Eighty-eight patients with localized PCA treated between 2013 and 2017 with either definitive PBT (31) or IMRT (57) were matched using propensity score matching on PCA risk group, transurethral resection of the prostate, prostate volume, diabetes mellitus and administration of anticoagulants resulting in 29 matched pairs. Early and late genitourinary (GU) and gastrointestinal (GI) toxicities according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) and QoL based on EORTC-QLQ-C30/PR25 questionnaires were collected prospectively until 12 months after radiotherapy (RT). Associations between toxicities and dose-volume parameters in corresponding organs at risk (OARs) were modeled by logistic regression. Results: There were no significant differences in GI and GU toxicities between both treatment groups except for late urinary urgency, which was significantly lower after PBT (IMRT: 25.0%, PBT: 0%, p = .047). Late GU toxicities and obstruction grade ≥2 were significantly associated with the relative volume of the anterior bladder wall receiving 70 Gy and the entire bladder receiving 60 Gy, respectively. The majority of patients in both groups reported high functioning and low symptom scores for the QoL questionnaires before and after RT. No or little changes were observed for most items between baseline and 3 or 12 months after RT, respectively. Global health status increased more at 12 months after IMRT (p = .040) compared to PBT, while the change of constipation was significantly better at 3 months after PBT compared to IMRT (p = .034). Conclusions: Overall, IMRT and PBT were well tolerated. Despite the superiority of PBT in early constipation and IMRT in late global health status compared to baseline, overall QoL and the risks of early and late GU and GI toxicities were similar for conventionally fractionated IMRT and PBT.""","""['Almut Dutz', 'Linda Agolli', 'Michael Baumann', 'Esther G C Troost', 'Mechthild Krause', 'Tobias Hölscher', 'Steffen Löck']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Acta Oncol""","""['Correction.', 'A case-matched study of toxicity outcomes after proton therapy and intensity-modulated radiation therapy for prostate cancer.', 'Comparative toxicity and dosimetric profile of whole-pelvis versus prostate bed-only intensity-modulated radiation therapy after prostatectomy.', 'Comparative toxicity outcomes of proton-beam therapy versus intensity-modulated radiotherapy for prostate cancer in the postoperative setting.', 'Late toxicity rates following definitive radiotherapy for prostate cancer.', 'Research progress on mechanism and dosimetry of brainstem injury induced by intensity-modulated radiotherapy, proton therapy, and heavy ion radiotherapy.', 'Long-Term Medical Resource Consumption of Radical Prostatectomy vs. Intensity-Modulated Radiotherapy for Old Patients With Prostate Cancer: A Nationwide Population-Based Cohort Study.', 'Editorial: Multifaceted Approaches Combining Low or High LET Radiation and Pharmacological Interventions in Cancer and Radioprotection: From Bench to Bedside.', 'Measuring Radiation Toxicity Using Circulating Cell-Free DNA in Prostate Cancer Patients.', 'Dose-volume histogram parameters and patient-reported EPIC-Bowel domain in prostate cancer proton therapy.', 'Androgen Deprivation Therapy Combined With Particle Therapy for Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Review.']"""

DAXX has a potent pro-survival effect by enhancing cell growth in PCa via suppression of autophagy. Here, we depicted a network governed by DAXX and SPOP by which the autophagy pathway is suppressed through the ubiquitination and modulation of key cellular signaling pathways mediators including LAMP2 and RARRES1.  Materials and methods:   Through network-based bioinformatics approaches, the expression levels of DAXX, RARRES1, LAMP2, and SPOP genes was assessed in 50 PCa tissues and 50 normal adjacent from the same sample as well as 50 benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) tissues by quantitative RT-PCR. The normal adjacent tissues were taken from regions more than 5mm away from the bulk of those tumor tissues with clearly distinct margins. RNA extraction, cDNA synthesis and Real-time Quantitative RT-PCR were done for assessment of gene expression. To evaluate the primary gene network centered on autophagy pathway, according to the Query-dependent weighting algorithm, these two networks were integrated with Cytoscape 3.4 software.  Results:   We found that in PCa tissues the DAXX expression level was significantly increased (P < 0.001) and the expressions of SPOP, RARRES1, and LAMP2 were significantly down-regulated, when compared to both control groups including normal adjacent and BPH tissues. Moreover, significant correlations were observed between expression levels of all four genes. Additionally, ROC curve analysis revealed that LAMP2 had the most sensitivity and specificity.

Materials and methods:   From March 2010 to June 2013, 52 patients suspected with prostate cancer based on laboratory or clinical test results and underwent prostate biopsy in our hospital were enrolled into this study. The age of these patients ranged between 45-82 years, with an average age of 67.2 ± 6.8 years. All patients underwent transrectal real-time ultrasound elastography (TRTE) before biopsy. A total of 63 prostate nodules were detected, and the 11 elastic characteristic quantities of these nodules were quantitatively analyzed via tissue diffusion quantitative analysis. The results of ultrasonography were compared with the results of operation and pathology.  Result:   Among these 11 characteristic quantities, which include the mean (MEAN) and standard deviation (SD), blue area ratio (AREA%), complexity (COMP), kurtosis (KURT), skewness (SKEW), contrast (CONT), equality (ENT), entropy (IDM), consistency (ASM) and correlation (CORR), except for COMP and CORR, the differences in other nine characteristic quantities between benign and malignant prostatic nodules were statistically significant (P<0.05).

Materials and methods:   The study cohort comprised 179 consecutive patients who underwent laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (LRP: n = 98) and robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP: n = 81) at Wakayama Medical University between July 2010 and May 2014. The length of MU was measured by preoperative MRI. The amount of resected rhabdosphincter and the length of resected MU were assessed in hematoxylin and eosin sections at the apical margin of prostate specimens. Patient-reported urinary continence status was determined at 3, 6, 12 and 24 months postoperatively, with urinary continence considered as 0-1 pads/day. Kaplan-Meier analysis and the log-rank test were used to compare time to urinary continence recovery. Multivariate Cox regression analyses were performed to determine the predictors of urinary continence.  Results:   RARP vs LRP (p = 0.02) and shorter length of resected MU (p = 0.01) showed significantly better postoperative continence recovery by log-rank test. Nerve-sparing, preoperative length of MU, and amount of resected rhabdosphincter did not significantly correlate with continence recovery. Only the length of resected MU was the independent factor for predicting postoperative urinary continence by multivariate Cox regression analysis (hazard ratio 0.84, p = 0.01).  Conclusion:   These results demonstrated that the length of resected MU measured by specimen was an independent predictor of urinary incontinence after radical prostatectomy.

The aim of this study was to investigate prognostic factors and to develop a risk stratification model for survival in patients with advanced prostate cancer undergoing endocrine therapy.  Materials and methods:   This study included 197 patients with stage IV prostate cancer who were treated with endocrine therapy as primary treatment at Tokyo Medical University, Tokyo, Japan, between January 1999 and November 2012. Prognostic values including baseline clinical laboratory values before endocrine therapy for stage IV prostate cancer were examined. Patients (n = 30) who were not followed or for whom data were unavailable or who were treated with radiotherapy were excluded from the study. Excluding these patients, we retrospectively analyzed 167 patients who were treated with endocrine therapy as the primary treatment. Disease-specific survival (DSS) was evaluated using the Kaplan-Meier method, and prognostic factors were identified using the Cox proportional hazard model analysis.  Results:   In univariate analyses, patients with a performance status (PS) ? 2, platelet count ? 3.0× 105 µ/L, prostate specific antigen (PSA) > 50 ng/mL, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) > 350 U/L, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) > 240 IU/L, and Gleason score (GS) ? 8, hemoglobin (Hb) < 12 g/dL, extent of disease (EOD) ? 3 and poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma showed significantly lower DSS than their respective counterparts. Neutrophil-to-Lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) and white blood cell (WBC) count were not significantly associated with DSS. In a multivariate Cox proportional hazard model, PS and platelet count were independent prognostic factors. Based on the hazard rate (HR) calculated by the following formula: HR = exp (0.82 × PS + 1.38 × platelet count) patients were stratified into 3 risk groups. The differences in DSS rates among the 3 groups were statistically significant.

Methods:   In this study, AuNRs capped with hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB), poly(acrylic acid) (PAA), and PEGylated anisamide (a ligand known to target the sigma receptor) have been developed to produce a range of negatively charged anisamide-targeted PEGylated AuNRs (namely Au-CTAB-PAA-PEG-AA) for the combination of PTT and chemotherapy (termed as chemo-photothermal therapy [CPTT]). Epirubicin (EPI, an anthracycline drug) was efficiently loaded onto the surface of Au800-CTAB-PAA-PEG-AA via the electrostatic interaction forming Au800-CTAB-PAA-PEG-AA.EPI complex.  Results:   The resultant complex demonstrated pH-dependent drug release, facilitated nucleus trafficking of EPI, and induced antiproliferative effects in human prostate cancer PC-3 cells.

The transcription factor zinc finger E-box-binding homeobox 1 (ZEB1), a key EMT activator, has recently been related to docetaxel resistance, the main chemotherapeutic used in advanced prostate cancer treatment. The mechanisms involved in this protective effect are still unclear. In a previous work, we demonstrated that ZEB1 expression induced an EMT-like phenotype in prostate cancer cell lines. In this work, we used prostate cancer cell lines 22Rv1 and DU145 to study the effect of ZEB1 modulation on docetaxel resistance and its possible mechanisms. The results showed that ZEB1 overexpression conferred to 22Rv1 cell resistance to docetaxel while its silencing made DU145 cells more sensitive to it. Analysis of resistance markers showed no presence of ATP-binding cassette subfamily B member 1 (MDR1) and no changes in breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) or ATP-binding cassette subfamily C member 10 (MRP7). However, a correlation between ZEB1, multidrug resistance-associated protein 1 (MRP1), and ATP-binding cassette subfamily C member 4 (MRP4) expression was observed. MRP4 inhibition, using MK571, resensitized cells with ZEB1 overexpression to docetaxel treatment. In addition, modulation of ZEB1 and subsequent change in MRP4 expression correlated with a lower apoptotic response to docetaxel, characterized by lower B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl2), high BCL2-associated X protein (Bax), and high active caspase 3 expression. The response to docetaxel in our model seems to be mediated mainly by activation of the apoptotic death program. Our results showed that modulation of MRP4 could be a mediator of ZEB1-related resistance to docetaxel in prostate cancer, making it a possible marker for chemotherapy response in patients who do not express MDR1.""","""['Octavio Orellana-Serradell', 'Daniela Herrera', 'Enrique A Castellón', 'Héctor R Contreras']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Asian J Androl""","""['The role of epithelial-mesenchymal transition drivers ZEB1 and ZEB2 in mediating docetaxel-resistant prostate cancer.', 'The transcription factor ZEB1 promotes an aggressive phenotype in prostate cancer cell lines.', 'Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition mediates docetaxel resistance and high risk of relapse in prostate cancer.', 'Role of ZEB Family Members in Proliferation, Metastasis, and Chemoresistance of Prostate Cancer Cells: Revealing Signaling Networks.', 'The Transcription Factors Zeb1 and Snail Induce Cell Malignancy and Cancer Stem Cell Phenotype in Prostate Cells, Increasing Androgen Synthesis Capacity and Therapy Resistance.', 'Biochanin A inhibits lung adenocarcinoma progression by targeting ZEB1.', 'Post-Translational Modification of ZEB Family Members in Cancer Progression.', 'Cancer Stemness/Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition Axis Influences Metastasis and Castration Resistance in Prostate Cancer: Potential Therapeutic Target.', 'SPARC Induces E-Cadherin Repression and Enhances Cell Migration through Integrin αvβ3 and the Transcription Factor ZEB1 in Prostate Cancer Cells.', 'NUCB2: roles in physiology and pathology.']"""

This study was designed to analyze the contribution of single-nucleotide polymorphisms of the CDH1 (-160C/A) and Exo1 (K589E) to prostate cancer susceptibility in Bangladeshi population. The study included 100 prostate cancer cases and age-matched 100 healthy controls. Polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis was used to determine the genetic polymorphisms. A significant association was found between CDH1 -160C/A (rs16260) and Exo1 (rs1047840, K589E) polymorphisms and prostate cancer risk. In case of CDH1 -160C/A polymorphism, the frequencies of the three genotypes C/C,C/A, and A/A were 45%, 48%, and 7% in cases and 63%, 32%, and 5% in controls, respectively.

Recent prospective trials have explored addition of chemotherapy to ADT. We retrospectively examined overall survival in metastatic prostate cancer patients treated with ADT, chemotherapy plus ADT (C + ADT), or observation from 2004 to 2010 using National Cancer Database data.  Methods:   Using the National Cancer Database, 21,977 patients with metastatic prostate cancer diagnosed from 2004 to 2010 were identified. Multivariate logistic regression, Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and Cox proportional hazards regression modeling were implemented, with overall survival as the primary endpoint.  Results:   Five-year overall survival was 13.6% in patients aged ≥ 75 years vs. 30.1% (age 65-74) and 34.5% (age 18-64). Subgroup analysis of age-based cohorts (<65 and ≥65 years) showed poor overall survival for C + ADT vs. ADT alone, both in younger (HR 1.35, 95% CI 1.21-1.50; p < 0.0001) as well as older (HR 1.21, 95% CI 1.08-1.34; p = 0.0006) populations. Younger patients had no significant difference in overall survival for observation vs. ADT (HR 0.99, 95% CI 0.92-1.08; p = 0.9121). Besides age, other factors impacting overall survival included race, rural/urban settings, comorbidity score, income, PSA and radiation.  Discussion:   Younger patients had no significant difference in overall survival between observation or ADT. This implies a group of younger patients in whom ADT does not confer any overall survival benefit. Future clinical trials with genetic and biologic markers are needed to delineate which subgroups would not benefit from C + ADT or ADT alone.

Objectives:   The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of urinary bladder hypertrophy and overactive bladder (OAB) on UI in patients after RP.  Material and methods:   Seventy patients were enrolled in the study and were divided into 2 groups: patients with bladder outlet obstruction (BOO) but without OAB (group I; n = 20) and patients with BOO and OAB (group II; n = 50). Before the RP procedure, all patients were administered IPSS and OAB symptom questionnaires and ultrasonography and uroflowmetry were performed. The follow-up visits were scheduled for 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after the operation to evaluate postoperative continence.  Results:   The results show that patients with BOO and concurrent OAB experienced urinary bladder hypertrophy. Patients with OAB presented a normal desire to void with less urinary bladder capacity. The coexistence of OAB before RP resulted in more extensive UI, as measured with the ICIQ-UI-SF scores and postoperative daily pad usage. A gradual improvement in urinary continence was observed. Urinary incontinence was significantly less severe in successive check-ups (3, 6, 9, and 12 months after RP). Urgency was responsible for 1-15% or 16-29% of episodes of urinary leakage in 20% and 16% of cases, respectively.

S, with nearly 30,000 deaths per year. A key problem is the difficulty in distinguishing, after biopsy, between significant cancers that should be treated immediately and clinically insignificant tumors that should be monitored by active surveillance. Prostate cancer has been over-treated; a recent European randomized screening trial shows overtreatment rates of 40%. Overtreatment of insignificant tumors reduces quality of life, while delayed treatment of significant cancers increases the incidence of metastatic disease and death. We develop a decision analysis approach based on simulation and probability modeling. For a given prostate volume and number of biopsy needles, our rule is to treat if total length of cancer in needle cores exceeds c, the cutoff value, with active surveillance otherwise, provided pathology is favorable. We determine the optimal cutoff value, c*. There are two misclassification costs: treating a minimal tumor and not treating a small or medium tumor (large tumors were never misclassified in our simulations). Bayes' Theorem is used to predict the probabilities of minimal, small, medium, and large cancers given the total length of cancer found in biopsy cores. A 20 needle biopsy in conjunction with our new decision analysis approach significantly reduces the expected loss associated with a patient in our target population about to undergo a biopsy. Longer needles reduce expected loss. Increasing the number of biopsy cores from the current norm of 10-12 to about 20, in conjunction with our new decision model, should substantially improve the ability to distinguish minimal from significant prostate cancer by minimizing the expected loss from over-treating minimal tumors and delaying treatment of significant cancers.""","""['Arthur J Swersey', 'John Colberg', 'Ronald Evans', 'Michael W Kattan', 'Johannes Ledolter', 'Rodney Parker']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Health Care Manag Sci""","""['Probability modeling of the number of positive cores in a prostate cancer biopsy session, with applications.', 'Geometric systematic prostate biopsy.', 'Does cumulative prostate cancer length (CCL) in prostate biopsies improve prediction of clinically insignificant cancer at radical prostatectomy in patients eligible for active surveillance?', 'Nonpalpable stage T1c prostate cancer: prediction of insignificant disease using free/total prostate specific antigen levels and needle biopsy findings.', 'Prostate-Specific Antigen-Based Screening for Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Evidence Review for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force Internet.', 'Diagnostic Policies Optimization for Chronic Diseases Based on POMDP Model.']"""

Because histone-dependent activation is unique to PARP-1, non-NAD-like PARP-1 inhibitors have the potential to bypass the off-target effects of classical NAD-dependent PARP-1 inhibitors, such as olaparib, veliparib, and rucaparib. Furthermore, our recently published studies demonstrate that, compared to NAD-like PARP-1 inhibitors that are used clinically, the non-NAD-like PARP-1 inhibitor 5F02 exhibited superior antitumor activity in cell and animal models of human prostate cancer (PC). In this study, we further evaluated the antitumor activity of 5F02 and several of its novel analogues against PC cells. In contrast to NAD-like PARP-1 inhibitors, non-NAD-like PARP-1 inhibitors demonstrated efficacy against androgen-dependent and -independent routes of androgen receptor signaling activation. Our experiments reveal that methylation of the quaternary ammonium salt and the presence of esters were critical for the antitumor activity of 5F02 against PC cells. In addition, we examined the role of a related regulatory protein of PARP-1, called Poly(ADP-ribose) glycohydrolase (PARG), in prostate carcinogenesis. Our study reveals that PARG expression is severely disrupted in PC cells, which is associated with decreased integrity and localization of Cajal bodies (CB).

Then the results of meta-analyses were verified in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database by Student's t-test and Paired t-test. The candidate genes of miR-375 were predicted by four platforms.

Results:   The overall meta-analysis showed the expression of miR-375 was significantly up-regulated in PC groups compared with non-cancerous group (SMD; 0.71; 95% CI: 0.38-1.04).

The results of TCGA database verified the expression of miR-375 in PC tissues was obviously higher than that in adjacent non-cancerous tissues. Moreover, GO and KEGG analysis revealed that the latent target genes were mainly involved in protein binding function and ubiquitin mediated proteolysis. PPI analysis identified JAK2, EHMT1 and QKI as the hub genes (highly connected genes with high degree in PPI).  Conclusions:   MiR-375 was up-regulated in PC tissues.

This suggests that they may regulate epithelial cell survival and growth. The Sca-1+CD90-/low myofibroblast-like cells highly express genes associated with the extracellular matrix and cytokine-mediated signaling pathways, indicating a role in tissue repair and immune responses. The Sca-1+CD90-/low cells significantly suppress the capacity of the basal cells for bipotent differentiation in the prostate organoid assay. Collectively, we identify the surface markers enabling physical separation of stromal subpopulations and generate the gene expression profiles implying their cellular functions.""","""['Oh-Joon Kwon', 'Yiqun Zhang', 'Yumei Li', 'Xing Wei', 'Li Zhang', 'Rui Chen', 'Chad J Creighton', 'Li Xin']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""iScience""","""['Single-cell atlas of epithelial and stromal cell heterogeneity by lobe and strain in the mouse prostate.', 'Stem Cell Antigen-1 Identifies a Distinct Androgen-Independent Murine Prostatic Luminal Cell Lineage with Bipotent Potential.', 'Differential Inductive Signaling of CD90 Prostate Cancer-Associated Fibroblasts Compared to Normal Tissue Stromal Mesenchyme Cells.', 'Functional genomics of stromal cells in chronic inflammatory diseases.', 'Heterogeneity and plasticity in healthy and atherosclerotic vasculature explored by single-cell sequencing.', 'Androgen-regulated stromal complement component 7 (C7) suppresses prostate cancer growth.', 'Distinct mesenchymal cell states mediate prostate cancer progression.', 'Identification of cancer-associated fibroblasts subtypes in prostate cancer.', 'Interpretable and context-free deconvolution of multi-scale whole transcriptomic data with UniCell deconvolve.', 'Steroid hormone imbalance drives macrophage infiltration and Spp1/osteopontin+ foam cell differentiation in the prostate.']"""

Predicting the cancer incidence in an ageing population can help to anticipate future resource needs, evaluate primary prevention strategies, and inform further research studies.  Materials and methods:   Annual cancer cases and population data from 1988 to 2013 were collected from Shanghai Cancer Registry. A Bayesian age-period-cohort model was applied to project the future cancer incidence with demographical changes from 2014 to 2025.  Results:   From 1988 through 2013, the urban population aged < 65 years decreased by 19.5%, while the population aged ≥ 65 years increased by 58.4%. In the same period, cancer cases increased by 66.0% (from 8315 to 13,806) and 88.6% (from 7448 to 14,048) in these two populations, respectively. From 2014-2025, the population size is expected to decrease by an additional 29.6% in people aged < 65 years, while it will increase by an additional 68.3% in people aged ≥ 65 years. Correspondingly, the model predicts an 87.5% and 143.4% increase in cancer cases for these two populations, respectively. The most pronounced increase was found in thyroid cancer in both sexes, followed by prostate, kidney, and colon cancer in men. In women, lung, kidney, and cervical cancer in women was expected to increase.  Conclusions:   The number of cancer cases in urban Shanghai, especially in older people, is expected to significantly increase in the next decade.

Conventional biopsy protocols are based on standard 12-core transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) biopsy.  Objective:   To assess the value of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)/TRUS fusion biopsy over 4-yr follow-up in men on AS for low-risk PC.  Design, setting, and participants:   Between 2010 and 2018, a total of 273 men were included. Of them, 157 men with initial 12-core TRUS biopsy and 116 with initial MRI/TRUS fusion biopsy were followed by systematic and targeted transperineal MRI/TRUS fusion biopsies based on Prostate Cancer Research International Active Surveillance criteria. MRI from follow-up MRI/TRUS fusion biopsy was assessed using the Prostate Cancer Radiological Estimation of Change in Sequential Evaluation (PRECISE) scoring system.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   AS-disqualification rates for patients on AS initially diagnosed by either 12-core TRUS biopsy or by MRI/TRUS fusion biopsy were compared using Kaplan-Meier estimates, log-rank tests, and regression analyses. We also analyzed the influence of negative primary MRI and PRECISE scoring to predict AS disqualification using Kaplan-Meier estimates, log-rank tests, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis.  Results and limitations:   Of men diagnosed by 12-core TRUS biopsy, 59% were disqualified from AS based on the results of subsequent MRI/TRUS fusion biopsy. In the initial MRI fusion biopsy cohort, upgrading occurred significantly less frequently (19%, p<0.001). ROC curve analyses demonstrated good discrimination for the PRECISE score with an area under the curve of 0.83. No men with a PRECISE score of 1 or 2 (demonstrating absence or downgrading of lesions in follow-up MRI) were disqualified from AS. In our cohort, a negative baseline MRI scan was not a predictor of nondisqualification from AS. Limitations include transperineal approach and extended systematic biopsies used with MRI/TRUS fusion biopsy, which may not be representative of other centers.  Conclusions:   MRI/TRUS fusion biopsies allow a reliable risk classification for patients who are candidates for AS. The application of the PRECISE scoring system demonstrated good discrimination.  Patient summary:   In this study, we investigated the value of multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and MRI/transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) fusion biopsies for the assessment of active surveillance (AS) reliability using the Prostate Cancer Radiological Estimation of Change in Sequential Evaluation criteria. Standard TRUS biopsies lead to significant underestimation of prostate cancer. In contrast, MRI/TRUS fusion biopsies allowed for a more reliable risk classification.

Objective:   To evaluate an extensive repeat transrectal biopsy with anterior sampling in men starting on active surveillance.  Design, setting, and participants:   Randomised multicentre trial. From 2012 to 2016, 340 Swedish men, aged 40-75yr, with recently diagnosed low-volume Gleason grade group 1 prostate cancer were included.  Intervention:   Either an extensive transrectal biopsy with anterior sampling (median 19 cores) or a standard transrectal biopsy (median 12 cores).  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Primary outcome measure: Gleason grade group ≥2 cancer.  Secondary outcomes:   Cancer in anteriorly directed biopsy cores and postbiopsy infection. Nonparametric statistical tests were applied.  Results and limitations:   Gleason grade group ≥2 cancer was detected in 16% of 156 men who had an extensive biopsy and in 10% of 164 men who had a standard biopsy, a 5.7% difference (95% confidence interval [CI]-0.2% to 13%, p=0.09). There was a strong linear association between prostate-specific antigen (PSA) density and cancer in the anteriorly directed biopsy cores. The odds ratios for cancer in the anteriorly directed cores were for any cancer 2.2 (95% CI 1.3-3.9, p=0.004) and for Gleason grade group ≥2 cancer 2.3 (95% CI 1.2-4.4, p=0.015) per 0.1-ng/ml/cm3 increments. Postbiopsy infections were equally common in the two groups. A limitation is that magnetic resonance imaging was not used.  Conclusions:   The trial did not support general use of the extensive transrectal repeat biopsy template, but cancer in the anteriorly directed cores was common, particularly in men with high PSA density. The higher the PSA density, the stronger the reason to include anterior sampling at a systematic repeat biopsy.

Objective:   To compare relapse-free survival (RFS) in patients with HRPCa, treated primarily with radiotherapy (RT)+hormone therapy (HT) versus radical prostatectomy (RP) and salvage RT (sRT)±HT when biochemical recurrence (BCR) appears.  Material and methods:   Retrospective analysis of 226 patients with HRPCa (1996-2008), treated primarily with RT+HT (n=137) or RP (n=89). The Kaplan-Meier method has been used to evaluate survival and the log-rank test has been used to evaluate the contrast between the different categories of the variables. Multivariate analysis has been performed using Cox regression to determine variables with an impact on RFS with statistical significance (P<0.05).  Results:   The median follow-up of the series was 111 (IQR 85-137.5) months. After RT+HT, 32 (23.4%) patients relapsed, and after RP (P=0.0001), 41 (46.1%) cases. When comparing the primary treatments, the RFS at 5 and 10 years was higher after RT+HT versus RP in monotherapy (P=0.001). The primary treatment with RT+HT reduced the risk of BCR when compared to the RP (HR=0.41, P=0.002). The estimation of the RFS at 5 and 10 years after RP+sRT±HT was 89.7 and 87.1%, while after primary RT+HT was 91.6 and 71.1%, respectively (P=0.01). The only factor that behaved as an independent predictor of RFS was the multimodal treatment with RP+sRT±HT when BCR showed up (HR=2.39, P=0.01).  Conclusion:   In HRPCa, multimodal treatment with RP+sRT±HT if BCR, significantly improves RFS with respect to treatment with RT+HT.""","""['J Caño-Velasco', 'F Herranz-Amo', 'G Barbas-Bernardos', 'L Polanco-Pujol', 'F Verdú-Tartajo', 'E Lledó-García', 'C Hernández-Fernández']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Actas Urol Esp (Engl Ed)""","""['Survival analysis of patients with prostate cancer and unfavorable risk factors treated with radical prostatectomy and salvage radiotherapy after biochemical recurrence and persistence.', 'Use of Concomitant Androgen Deprivation Therapy in Patients Treated with Early Salvage Radiotherapy for Biochemical Recurrence After Radical Prostatectomy: Long-term Results from a Large, Multi-institutional Series.', 'Impact of Early Salvage Androgen Deprivation Therapy in Localized Prostate Cancer after Radical Prostatectomy: A Propensity Score Matched Analysis.', 'Use of androgen deprivation and salvage radiation therapy for patients with prostate cancer and biochemical recurrence after prostatectomy.', 'The timing of salvage radiotherapy after radical prostatectomy: a systematic review.', 'Characterizing Surgical and Radiotherapy Outcomes in Non-metastatic High-Risk Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.']"""

Data from animal studies suggest that for androgens to cause prostate cancer, they must be aromatized to estrogen and act in concert with estrogen metabolites. We tested the hypothesis that androgen-receptor and estrogen receptor-mediated effects of androgen and estrogen are necessary, as well as genotoxicity of estrogen metabolites. NBL rats were treated with androgenic and estrogenic compounds for 16-75 weeks through slow-release silastic implants or pellets. Testosterone alone induced cancer in the prostate of 37% of rats. 5α-Dihydrotestosterone, which cannot be converted to estradiol or testosterone, did not cause a significant prostate cancer incidence (4%). Addition of estradiol to 5α-dihydrotestosterone treatment did not markedly enhance prostate cancer incidence (14%), unlike adding estradiol to testosterone treatment which induced a 100% tumor incidence. Testosterone plus estradiol treatment induced a DNA adduct detectable by 32P-postlabeling, oxidative DNA damage (8-hydroxyguanosine), and lipid peroxidation at the site within the prostate where this treatment causes cancers, preceding later cancer formation. The non-estrogenic 4-hydroxy metabolite of estradiol, when combined with testosterone, induced prostatic dysplasia within 16 weeks and, after long-term treatment, a very low incidence of prostate cancer (21%). When an estrogen that cannot be hydroxylated (2-fluoroestradiol) was added to this combined treatment with testosterone and 4-hydroxyestradiol, dysplasia frequency after 16 weeks was doubled. These results strongly support the hypothesis, but additional definitive studies are needed which may identify new targets to interfere with these mechanisms that are clinically feasible in humans.""","""['Nur Ozten', 'Katherine Vega', 'Joachim Liehr', 'Xi Huang', 'Lori Horton', 'Ercole L Cavalieri', 'Eleanor G Rogan', 'Maarten C Bosland']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Horm Cancer""","""['Hormonal and genotoxic estrogen-androgen carcinogenesis in the NBL rat prostate: A role for aromatase.', 'Induction of a DNA adduct detectable by 32P-postlabeling in the dorsolateral prostate of NBL/Cr rats treated with estradiol-17 beta and testosterone.', 'Sex steroids and prostate carcinogenesis: integrated, multifactorial working hypothesis.', 'A perspective on the role of estrogen in hormone-induced prostate carcinogenesis.', 'Estrogen and prostate cancer: an eclipsed truth in an androgen-dominated scenario.', 'Tadalafil and Steroid Hormones Interactions in Adipose, Bone and Prostate Tissues: Focus on Translational Perspectives.', 'Selective estrogen receptor modulators contribute to prostate cancer treatment by regulating the tumor immune microenvironment.', 'Serine and one-carbon metabolisms bring new therapeutic venues in prostate cancer.', 'Recent advances in cancer immunotherapy.', 'Effects of Black Raspberries and Their Constituents on Rat Prostate Carcinogenesis and Human Prostate Cancer Cell Growth In Vitro.']"""

Some debate this policy by quoting the potential risk of mesh lying close to the vesicourethral anastomosis leading to infections and adhesions. The current study was initiated to elucidate the feasibility and outcomes of simultaneous inguinal herniorrhaphy (IHR) during RALP.  Methods:   Historic analysis of prospectively maintained data of 1224 RALP patients, as per inclusion criteria, between 2012 and 2017 was done, among whom 143 patients had a concurrent IHR using 3DmaxTM polypropylene monofilament mesh. Patients were then compared for demographics, peri-operative features, and outcomes.  Results:   The mean age and AUA score were significantly different (p < 0.002, p < 0.01 respectively) between patients undergoing only RALP and RALP with IHR. BMI was not significantly different. One hundred forty-three patients (11.6%) underwent IHR at 155 hernial sites, 12 sites being bilateral. One hundred and one sites (65.2%) were diagnosed intraoperatively. The mean console time was 67.4 ± 11.5 min for RALP which increased by 6.9 ± 10.7 min in unilateral and by 10.7 ± 8.6 min in bilateral IHR. There were no mesh-associated or Clavien Dindo class II-V complications. Mean follow-up was 36 ± 1.4 months with no recurrences.

Our purpose was to compare the frequency and intensity of FD and its associations with symptom distress and quality of life (QOL) in these patients in France and the U.S.  Materials and methods:   In this secondary analysis of two cross-sectional studies, we assessed data on 292 patients who received cancer care at a public hospital or a comprehensive cancer center in France (143 patients) or the U.S. (149 patients). Outpatients and hospitalized patients over 18 years of age with advanced lung or breast or colorectal or prostate cancer were included. Diagnosed cognitive disorder was considered a noninclusion criterion. Advanced cancer included relapse or metastasis or locally advanced cancer or at least a second-line chemotherapy regimen. Patients self-rated FD and assessed symptoms, psychosocial distress, and QOL on validated questionnaires.  Results:   The average patient age was 59 years, and 144 (49%) were female. FD and high intensity were reported more frequently in U.S. patients than in French (respectively 129 [88%] vs. 74 [52%], p < .001; 100 [98%] vs. 48 [34%], p < .001,). QOL was rated higher by the U.S. patients than by the French (69 [SD, 18] vs. 63 [SD, 18], p = .003). French patients had more psychological symptoms such as anxiety (8 [SD, 4] vs. 6 [SD, 5], p = .008). Associations were found between FD and U.S. residence, FD and single status (0.907, p = .023), and FD and metastasis (1.538, p = .036). In contrast, negative associations were found between FD and older age (-0.052, p = .003) and FD and France residence (-3.376, p = .001).  Conclusion:   Regardless of health care system, FD is frequent in patients with advanced cancer. U.S. patients were more likely to have FD than French patients but reported better QOL. Further research should focus on factors contributing to FD and opportunities for remediation.  Implications for practice:   Suffering is experienced in any component of the lives of patients with a life-threatening illness. Financial distress (FD) is one of the least explored cancer-related symptoms, and there are limited studies describing its impact on this frail population. This study highlights the high frequency and severity of FD in patients with advanced cancer in the U.S. and France as well as its impact on their physical and emotional symptoms and their quality of life in these different health care systems. It is necessary for all health care providers to explore and evaluate the presence of FD in patients living with life-threatening illnesses.""","""['Cécile Barbaret', 'Marvin O Delgado-Guay', 'Stéphane Sanchez', 'Christelle Brosse', 'Murielle Ruer', 'Wadih Rhondali', 'Léa Monsarrat', 'Patrick Michaud', 'Anne Marie Schott', 'Eduardo Bruera', 'Marilène Filbet']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Oncologist""","""['Financial Distress and Its Associations With Physical and Emotional Symptoms and Quality of Life Among Advanced Cancer Patients.', 'Financial distress in patients with advanced cancer.', 'The relationship between household income and patient-reported symptom distress and quality of life in children with advanced cancer: A report from the PediQUEST study.', 'Psychosocial interventions for men with prostate cancer.', 'Distress and Quality of Life Among Patients with Advanced Genitourinary Cancers.', 'Financial distress and its associated burden in couples coping with an advanced cancer.', 'Assessment of Financial Toxicity Among Patients With Advanced Lung Cancer in Western China.', 'Distress and Spiritual Well-Being in Brazilian Patients Initiating Chemotherapy during the COVID-19 Pandemic-A Cross-Sectional Study.', 'Patient-Reported Financial Distress in Cancer: A Systematic Review of Risk Factors in Universal Healthcare Systems.', 'Racial and ethnic disparities in post-traumatic stress and illness coherence in breast cancer survivors with comorbid diabetes.']"""

Methods: We developed a universal dual-modality linker (DML) that facilitates site-specific conjugation to a cysteine residue-bearing antibody fragment, introduction of a commercially available fluorescent dye (via an amine-reactive prosthetic group), and rapid and efficient radiolabeling via click chemistry with 18F-labeled trans-cyclooctene (18F-TCO). To generate a dual-modality antibody fragment-based imaging agent, the DML was labeled with the far-red dye sulfonate cyanine 5 (sCy5), site-specifically conjugated to the C-terminal cysteine of the anti-prostate stem cell antigen (PSCA) cys-diabody A2, and subsequently radiolabeled by click chemistry with 18F-TCO. The new imaging probe was evaluated in a human PSCA-positive prostate cancer xenograft model by sequential immuno-PET and optical imaging. Uptake in target tissues was confirmed by ex vivo biodistribution. Results: We successfully synthesized a DML for conjugation of a fluorescent dye and 18F. The anti-PSCA cys-diabody A2 was site-specifically conjugated with either DML or sCy5 and radiolabeled via click chemistry with 18F-TCO. Immuno-PET imaging confirmed in vivo antigen-specific targeting of prostate cancer xenografts as early as 1 h after injection. Rapid renal clearance of the 50-kDa antibody fragment enables same-day imaging. Optical imaging showed antigen-specific fluorescent signal in PSCA-positive xenografts and high contrast to surrounding tissue and PSCA-negative xenografts. Conclusion: The DML enables site-specific conjugation away from the antigen-binding site of antibody fragments, with a controlled linker-to-protein ratio, and combines signaling moieties for 2 imaging systems into 1 molecule.

Here we report the complication rate and toxicity of the implantation procedure in a large cohort of patients who have either received a gel- or balloon-type spacer.  Methods:   In total, 403 patients received rectal spacing, 264 with balloon, 139 with gel. Allocation was non-randomized. Two hundred seventy-six patients were treated with normofractionated regimen, the remaining 125 patients in moderate hypofractionation. Spacer related acute and late rectal toxicity was prospectively assessed by endoscopy using a mucosa scoring system (Vienna Rectoscopy Score) as well as CTCAE V.4. For the balloon subgroup, position and rotation of balloon spacers were additionally correlated to incidence and grade of rectal reactions in a post-hoc analysis of post-implant planning MRIs.  Results:   Overall rectal toxicity was very low with average VRS scores of 0.06 at the day after implantation, 0.10 at the end of RT, 0.31 at 6 months and 0.42 at 12 months follow up. Acute Grade 3 toxicity (rectum perforation and urethral damage) directly related to the implantation procedure occurred in 1.49% (n = 6) and was seen exclusively in patients who had received the spacer balloon. Analysis of post implant MR imaging did not identify abnormal or mal-rotated positions of this spacer to be a predictive factors for the occurrence of spacer related G3 toxicities.

Methods:   The registry collects all new cancer cases, details of the individual affected, tumor site and follow-up. World-standardized incidence and mortality rates were calculated, by tumor site and sex for solid tumors from the MCR database for the study period 2001-2015.  Results:   Over the period 2001-2015, a total of 22,801 new cases were diagnosed; 13,863 in men (60.8%) and 8938 in women (39.2%). In 2011-2015, 1631 new cases were diagnosed per year. Age-standardized (to the world population) incidence rates for all cancers, were 289.8 per 100,000 men and 171.0 per 100,000 women. Breast, colon-rectum and stomach were the most common cancer sites in women. Prostate, colon-rectum and stomach were the main sites in men.

This metabolic shift by Cuc D was correlated with decreased expression of GLUT1 by its direct binding as suggested by its proficient molecular docking (binding energy -8.5 kcal/mol). Cuc D treatment also altered the expression of key oncogenic proteins and miR-132 that are known to be involved in glucose metabolism. Cuc D (0.1 to 1 µM) treatment inhibited tumorigenic and metastatic potential of human PrCa cells via inducing apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in G2/M phase.

The results revealed that MG-63 cells contained low levels of miR-363, and that overexpression of miR-363 in MG-63 cells significantly inhibited the vitality, proliferation, and colony formation ability of the cells, but promoted their apoptosis and G1/S arrest by regulating proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and caspase-3 expression. Additionally, miR-363 impaired the migration and invasion of MG-63 cells by regulating the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) phenotype. Notably, a bioinformatics analysis and luciferase reporter assay indicated that PDZD2 was a direct target of miR-363. miR-363 overexpression reduced PDZD2 protein levels and knockdown of PDZD2 suppressed the colony formation, migration and invasion of MG-63 cells, but promoted their apoptosis by regulating expression of PCNA, caspase-3, and the EMT phenotype.

No antibiotics were prescribed after TRUS-Bx.  Results:   The 120 were assigned in the treatment group using povidone-iodine suppository and 130 were assigned in the control group. There was no significant difference of clinicopathologic features including age, prostate-specific antigen and cancer detection rate in both groups (P > .05). No infectious and non-infectious complications were reported in both groups. Povidone-iodine suppository-related side effects were not reported. No significant differences in international prostate symptom score, sexual health inventory for men score, and European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life questionnaire scores were found between the 2 groups (P > .05). No changes in each questionnaire scores between before and after TRUS-Bx were observed.  Conclusions:   Despite satisfying the predefined sample size, we could not prove the hypothesis that the use of povidone-iodine suppositories after TRUS-Bx would reduce infectious complications. A large-scale, multicenter, prospective study is needed to fully evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of povidone-iodine suppository prior to TRUS-Bx.""","""['Hoyoung Ryu', 'Sang Hun Song', 'Sang Eun Lee', 'Kyoung-Ho Song', 'Sangchul Lee']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Medicine (Baltimore)""","""['Transrectal povidone-iodine efficiency in reducing infections occurring after transrectal ultrasound guided biopsy of the prostate.', 'Povidone-iodine rectal cleansing and targeted antimicrobial prophylaxis using rectal swab cultures in men undergoing transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy are associated with reduced incidence of postoperative infectious complications.', 'Effect of intrarectal povidone-iodine in the incidence of infectious complications after transrectal prostatic biopsy.', 'Guidelines for Transrectal Ultrasonography-Guided Prostate Biopsy: Korean Society of Urogenital Radiology Consensus Statement for Patient Preparation, Standard Technique, and Biopsy-Related Pain Management.', 'Multiparametric MRI in detection and staging of prostate cancer.', 'Minimizing transrectal prostate biopsy-related infections; A prospective randomized trial of povidone-iodine intrarectal cleaning versus formalin needle disinfection.', 'A novel method for pain control: infiltration free local anesthesia technique (INFLATE) for transrectal prostatic biopsy using transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS).']"""

The computational results indicated that the alchemical method can accurately predict the binding affinities, while the end-point methods give relatively unreliable predictions. Decomposing the free energy difference into enthalpic and entropic components with MBAR reweighting enabled us to investigate the detailed thermodynamic parameters with which the entropy-enthalpy compensation in this protein-ligand binding case is identified.

Ranolazine is a clinically used VGSC inhibitor/anti-anginal drug, which has been shown previously to inhibit breast cancer metastasis in vivo.  Methods:   Using the Dunning model of rat PCa, the effect of ranolazine applied systemically (by gavage) was tested on the development of primary tumours and metastases following subcutaneous inoculation of Mat-LyLu cells into Copenhagen rats. In addition, human prostate tissue microarrays were used to determine VGSC protein expression in cancerous versus non-cancerous tissue. Several public databases were searched to compare Nav1.7/ SCN9A expression levels in 'normal' vs. PCa tissues.  Results:   Ranolazine (2.5 and 5 µM) decreased the number of lung metastases by up to 63%. In contrast, primary tumourigenesis was not affected. Ranolazine also reduced the percentage of cells in the metastases expressing Nav1.7, the main VGSC subtype expressed in PCa, but the expression level was higher. In prostate tissue microarrays, VGSC protein expression was significantly higher in cancerous versus non-cancerous tissue. There was no correlation between the VGSC expression and either prostate-specific antigen or Gleason score. In public databases, little information could be found on Nav1.7 protein expression in PCa. In addition, the database information on Nav1.7 mRNA (SCN9A) expression levels did not correlate with previously reported upregulation in PCa cells and tissues.  Conclusions:   The main conclusions were (i) ranolazine inhibited metastasis and (ii) it was a subpopulation of cells with particularly high levels of Nav1.7 protein that reached the metastatic sites. These data extend earlier studies and suggest that Nav1.7 expression could serve as a functional biomarker of metastatic PCa and that VGSC blockers may be useful as anti-metastatic agents.""","""['Ilknur Bugan', 'Selma Kucuk', 'Zeynep Karagoz', 'Scott P Fraser', 'Handan Kaya', 'Andrew Dodson', 'Christopher S Foster', 'Seyhan Altun', 'Mustafa B A Djamgoz']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Prostate Cancer Prostatic Dis""","""['Nerve growth factor enhances voltage-gated Na+ channel activity and Transwell migration in Mat-LyLu rat prostate cancer cell line.', 'Riluzole: Anti-invasive effects on rat prostate cancer cells under normoxic and hypoxic conditions.', 'Voltage-gated sodium channel activity promotes prostate cancer metastasis in vivo.', 'Molecular pharmacology of voltage-gated sodium channel expression in metastatic disease: clinical potential of neonatal Nav1.5 in breast cancer.', 'The Functional Role of Voltage-Gated Sodium Channel Nav1.5 in Metastatic Breast Cancer.', 'Potassium Channels, Glucose Metabolism and Glycosylation in Cancer Cells.', 'Targeting lipid metabolism in metastatic prostate cancer.', 'Sodium channel-inhibiting drugs and cancer-specific survival: a population-based study of electronic primary care data.', 'Anti-invasive effects of minoxidil on human breast cancer cells: combination with ranolazine.', 'Ranolazine: An Old Drug with Emerging Potential; Lessons from Pre-Clinical and Clinical Investigations for Possible Repositioning.']"""

Most humans have a GPRC6A variant that contains a recently evolved KGKY insertion/deletion in the third intracellular loop (ICL3) (designated as GPRC6AICL3_KGKY) that replaces the ancestral KGRKLP sequence (GPRC6AICL3_RKLP) present in all other species. In vitro assays purport that human GPRC6AICL3_KGKY is retained intracellularly and lacks function. These findings contrast with ligand-dependent activation and coupling to mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling of endogenous human GPRC6AICL3_KGKY in PC-3 cells. To understand these discrepant results, we expressed mouse (mGPRC6AICL3_KGRKLP), human (hGPRC6AICL3_KGKY), and humanized mouse (mGPRC6AICL3_KGKY) GPRC6A into human embryonic kidney 293 cells. Our results demonstrate that mGPRC6AICL3_KGRKLP acts as a classic G protein-coupled receptor, which is expressed at the cell membrane and internalizes in response to ligand activation by testosterone. In contrast, hGPRC6AICL3_KGKY and humanized mouse mGPRC6AICL3_KGKY are retained intracellularly in ligand naive cells, yet exhibit β-arrestin-dependent signaling responses, mitogen-activated protein kinase [i.e., extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)], and p70S6 kinase phosphorylation in response to testosterone, indicating that hGPRC6AICL3_KGKY is functional. Indeed, testosterone stimulates time- and dose-dependent activation of ERK, protein kinase B, and mTORC1 signaling in wild-type PC-3 cells that express endogenous GPRC6AICL3_KGKY In addition, testosterone stimulates GPRC6A-dependent cell proliferation in wild-type PC-3 cells and inhibits autophagy by activating mTORC1 effectors eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E binding protein 1 and Unc-51 like autophagy activating kinase 1. Testosterone activation of GPRC6A has the obligate requirement for calcium in the incubation media. In contrast, in GPRC6A-deficient cells, the effect of testosterone to activate downstream signaling is abolished, indicating that human GPRC6A is required for mediating the effects of testosterone on cell proliferation and autophagy.""","""['Ruisong Ye', 'Min Pi', 'Mohammed M Nooh', 'Suleiman W Bahout', 'L Darryl Quarles']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Mol Pharmacol""","""['CRISPR/Cas9 targeting of GPRC6A suppresses prostate cancer tumorigenesis in a human xenograft model.', 'DRD3 (dopamine receptor D3) but not DRD2 activates autophagy through MTORC1 inhibition preserving protein synthesis.', 'Humanized GPRC6AKGKY is a gain-of-function polymorphism in mice.', 'Explaining Divergent Observations Regarding Osteocalcin/GPRC6A Endocrine Signaling.', 'GPRC6A: Jack of all metabolism (or master of none).', 'Diverse role of androgen action in human breast cancer.', ""NLRP3 Inflammasome's Activation in Acute and Chronic Brain Diseases-An Update on Pathogenetic Mechanisms and Therapeutic Perspectives with Respect to Other Inflammasomes."", 'Identification of actionable targets for breast cancer intervention using a diversity outbred mouse model.', ""'Toxic Masculinity': What Is Known about the Role of Androgen Receptors in Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma."", 'Nuclear and Membrane Receptors for Sex Steroids Are Involved in the Regulation of Delta/Serrate/LAG-2 Proteins in Rodent Sertoli Cells.']"""

Specific inhibition of the enzyme helps prevent immune reactivation of the glucuronide- carcinogens, thus protecting the intestine from ROS (Reactive Oxidative Species) mediatedcarcinogenesis.  Objectives:   Advancement in In-silico based techniques has provided a broad range of studies to carry out the drug design and development process smoothly using SwissADME and BOILED-Egg tools.  Methods:   In our designed case study, we used SwissADME and BOILED-Egg predictive computational tools to estimate the physicochemical, human pharmacokinetics, drug-likeness, medicinal chemistry properties and membrane permeability characteristics of our recently In-vitro evaluated novel β-Glucuronidase inhibitors.  Results:   Out of the eleven screened potent inhibitors, compound (8) exhibited excellent bioavailability radar against the six molecular descriptors, good (ADME) Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism and Excretion along with P-glycoprotein, CYP450 isozymes and membranes permeability profile. On the basis of these factual observations, it is to be predicted that compound (8) can achieve in-vivo experimental clearance efficiently, Therefore, in the future, it can be a drug in the market to treat various disorders associated with the overexpression of β-Glucuronidase enzyme such as various types of cancer, particularly hormone-dependent cancer such as (breast, prostate, and colon cancer). Moreover, other compounds (1-7, & 9-11), have also shown good predictive pharmacokinetics, medicinal chemistry, BBB and HIA membranes permeability profiles with slight lead optimization to obtain improved results.  Conclusion:   In consequence, in-silico based studies are considered to provide robustness for a rational drug design and development approach to avoid the possibility of failures of drug candidates in the later stages of drug development phases.

Methods: A total of 50 patients with histologically confirmed as prostate cancer were examined from May 2015 to May 2016 in the Second Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University using DWI performed at 3.0 T with an extended b-value range from 0 to 2 000 s/mm(2). Data were post-processed by whole tumor histogram analysis,the ROI was manually drown in DWI (b=1 000 s/mm(2)) step by step along the outline of cancer, and quantitative analysis were performed respectively by mono-exponential, bi-exponential and diffusion kurtosis models for quantification of apparent diffusion coefficients (ADCs), diffusivity D, pseudo-diffusivity D(*), perfusion fraction f, diffusion coefficients by non-Gaussian distribution (D(k)) and kurtosis coefficient (K).Then the histogram analysis was performed to get the mean, median, 25th percentile, 75th percentile, skewness and kurtosis. The correlation between histogram analysis results of these quantitative parameters and Gleason score of prostate cancer were evaluated by Spearman correlation coefficient. The diagnostic performance of histogram analysis results of each quantitative parameters in identifying low (Gleason score≤6) and high (Gleason score>6) grade prostate cancer was performed by comparing the area under the ROC curve and the curve values. Results: The values of ADC, D and D(k) (mean, median, 25th, 75th) were negatively correlated with Gleason score of prostate cancer (r value was -0.388--0.624, P<0.05). The values of D (skewness and kurtosis) had a certain correlation with Gleason score of prostate cancer (r value were 0.413 and 0.402, P<0.05). The histogram analysis results of D(*) and f had no statistically significant correlation with Gleason score of prostate cancer (P>0.05). The values of K (mean, median, 25th, kurtosis) were positively correlated with Gleason score of prostate cancer (r value was 0.423-0.699,P<0.05). The diagnostic efficiency of histogram analysis results of these quantitative parameter values in identifying low and high grade prostate cancer showed that the ADC (median), D (25th), D(k) (mean) and K (25th) had a larger area under the curve, and were 0.844, 0.873, 0.815, and 0.919 respectively, the differences of area under the curve between any two of these parameters above were not statistically significant (all P>0.05). Conclusions: The quantitative parameters of three diffusion models (ADC, D, D(k), K) in DWI are all related to the Gleason score of prostate cancer, but in the differential diagnosis of low and high grade prostate cancer, the diagnostic efficacy of mono-exponential model is sufficient.

Patients with urolithiasis, prostate cancer, bladder cancer, gross hematuria, previous bladder radiation therapy, or urinary tract surgery were excluded. Parameters of intravesical prostatic protrusion (IPP), serum prostatic specific antigen (PSA), total prostate volume (PV), age, body mass index (BMI), hypertension (HTN), diabetes mellitus (DM), coronary artery disease (CAD), and serum creatinine (Cr) were compared between the hydronephrosis and non-hydronephrosis groups.  Results:   There were significant differences in IPP (p < 0.001) and Serum Cr (p < 0.001) between the hydronephrosis and non-hydronephrosis groups. For IPP, the cut-off values of the highest risk of hydronephrosis was 1.95 cm. There were no significant differences in age, BMI, DM, HTN, CAD, total PV, and PSA between the two groups. IPP was not correlated with total PV (p = 0.423). Most of the patients with hydronephrosis had renal function improvement after TURP.  Conclusion:   IPP was a significant risk factor for hydronephrosis in BPH patients. If the patients' IPP exceeded 1.95 cm, they had a higher risk of having hydronephrosis when AUR occurred. Hydronephrosis is a risk factor for renal insufficiency, and Serum Cr levels decreased significantly in the patients of our study.""","""['Chin-Heng Lu', 'Howard H H Wu', 'Tzu-Ping Lin', 'Yi-Hsiu Huang', 'Hsiao-Jen Chung', 'Junne-Yih Kuo', 'William J Huang', 'Shing-Hwa Lu', 'Yen-Hwa Chang', 'Alex T L Lin']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""J Chin Med Assoc""","""['Clinical impact of the intravesical prostatic protrusion: a review by the LUTS committee of the French Urological Association.', 'Correlation of serum prostate specific antigen, the volume and the intravesical prostatic protrusion for diagnosing bladder outlet obstruction in patients with benign prostate hyperplasia.', 'Is intravesical prostatic protrusion associated with more complications in benign prostatic hyperplasia patients?', 'Intravesical Prostatic Protrusion as a Predicting Factor for the Adverse Clinical Outcome in Patients With Symptomatic Benign Prostatic Enlargement Treated With Dutasteride.', 'Randomised evaluation of alternative electrosurgical modalities to treat bladder outflow obstruction in men with benign prostatic hyperplasia.', 'Construction of lncRNA- and circRNA-associated ceRNA networks in the prostatic urethra of rats after simulating transurethral laser prostatectomy (TULP).', 'Effects of Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract on the Hormones, Serum Biochemicals, and Hematological Parameters in Dogs with Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia.']"""

Loss of ERG expression is associated with diseases including atherosclerosis. ERG's homeostatic function is lineage-specific, because aberrant ERG expression in cancer is oncogenic. The molecular basis for ERG lineage-specific activity is unknown. Transcriptional regulation of lineage specificity is linked to enhancer clusters (super-enhancers).  Objective:   To investigate whether ERG regulates endothelial-specific gene expression via super-enhancers.  Methods and results:   Chromatin immunoprecipitation with high-throughput sequencing in human umbilical vein endothelial cells showed that ERG binds 93% of super-enhancers ranked according to H3K27ac, a mark of active chromatin. These were associated with endothelial genes such as DLL4 (Delta-like protein 4), CLDN5 (claudin-5), VWF (von Willebrand factor), and CDH5 (VE-cadherin). Comparison between human umbilical vein endothelial cell and prostate cancer TMPRSS2 (transmembrane protease, serine-2):ERG fusion-positive human prostate epithelial cancer cell line (VCaP) cells revealed distinctive lineage-specific transcriptome and super-enhancer profiles. At a subset of endothelial super-enhancers (including DLL4 and CLDN5), loss of ERG results in significant reduction in gene expression which correlates with decreased enrichment of H3K27ac and MED (Mediator complex subunit)-1, and reduced recruitment of acetyltransferase p300. At these super-enhancers, co-occupancy of GATA2 (GATA-binding protein 2) and AP-1 (activator protein 1) is significantly lower compared with super-enhancers that remained constant following ERG inhibition. These data suggest distinct mechanisms of super-enhancer regulation in endothelial cells and highlight the unique role of ERG in controlling a core subset of super-enhancers. Most disease-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms from genome-wide association studies lie within noncoding regions and perturb transcription factor recognition sequences in relevant cell types. Analysis of genome-wide association studies data shows significant enrichment of risk variants for cardiovascular disease and other diseases, at ERG endothelial enhancers and super-enhancers.  Conclusions:   The transcription factor ERG promotes endothelial homeostasis via regulation of lineage-specific enhancers and super-enhancers. Enrichment of cardiovascular disease-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms at ERG super-enhancers suggests that ERG-dependent transcription modulates disease risk.""","""['Viktoria Kalna', 'Youwen Yang', 'Claire R Peghaire', 'Karen Frudd', 'Rebecca Hannah', 'Aarti V Shah', 'Lourdes Osuna Almagro', 'Joseph J Boyle', 'Berthold Göttgens', 'Jorge Ferrer', 'Anna M Randi', 'Graeme M Birdsey']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Circ Res""","""['Dynamic regulation of VEGF-inducible genes by an ERK/ERG/p300 transcriptional network.', 'Genomic Characterization of Endothelial Enhancers Reveals a Multifunctional Role for NR2F2 in Regulation of Arteriovenous Gene Expression.', 'Binding of TMPRSS2-ERG to BAF Chromatin Remodeling Complexes Mediates Prostate Oncogenesis.', 'Regulation of endothelial homeostasis, vascular development and angiogenesis by the transcription factor ERG.', 'The progress of TMPRSS2-ETS gene fusions and their mechanism in prostate cancer.', 'Temporal transcriptome features identify early skeletal commitment during human epiphysis development at single-cell resolution.', 'Cytokine-Mediated Degradation of the Transcription Factor ERG Impacts the Pulmonary Vascular Response to Systemic Inflammatory Challenge.', 'SOX17 Enhancer Variants Disrupt Transcription Factor Binding And Enhancer Inactivity Drives Pulmonary Hypertension.', 'Integrative analysis of a novel super-enhancer-associated lncRNA prognostic signature and identifying LINC00945 in aggravating glioma progression.', 'Genetic association analysis of 77,539 genomes reveals rare disease etiologies.']"""

Long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) GAS5 has been identified to mediate cell proliferation in prostate cancer, although its role in CNP is still unclear. Human prostate epithelial cell line RWPE-1 was induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to mimic CNP model in vitro. Real-time PCR was performed to determine the expression of GAS5 and COX-2, while western blotting was used to evaluate the protein expression of COX-2. The interaction between GAS5 and COX-2 was determined using RNA pull-down and RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP). Cell proliferation was determined using MTT assay. The expression of GAS5 was decreased, while COX-2 was increased in prostatitis tissues and in LPS-induced RWPE-1 cells. The overexpression of GAS5 suppressed the protein level of COX-2, and inhibited cell proliferation of LPS-induced RWPE-1 cells and HPECs, which was rescued by the co-transfection with pcDNA-GAS5 and pcDNA-COX-2. GAS5 was confirmed to promote the ubiquitination of COX-2, and the in vivo GAS5-overexpressed CNP rat model decreased the motor scores, the volume of prostate tissues, the average number of inflammatory cells, prostatic proliferation, and COX-2 expression.

However, to date, there has been no characterization of urology's contribution to the robotic field, and there is a lack of bibliometric literature to guide future investigation. We conducted this bibliometric analysis to characterize the distributions and characteristics of robotic surgery research in the urologic field, with subanalysis of the top 100 articles. Materials and Methods: The Web of Science Core Collection of the ISI Web of Science was searched and analyzed to determine distributions and characteristics of robotic urologic surgery research. The top 100 articles were categorized by urologic subfield and organ of pathology, with a level of evidence rating system applied (adapted from the Centre of Evidence-Based Medicine). Results: The total number of articles retrieved was 1294 from 1999 to 2018. The number of articles published in the last decade has increased by 845.75%, with 153 articles published in the preceding decade. The United States leads countries in publication with 699 (54.02%) articles across the field, and 71 within the top 100 articles. The Journal of Endourology published most articles (n = 292, 22.57%) within the field, while European Urology published most (n = 36) within the top 100 articles. Top 100 articles where generally associated with cancer (n = 76), with prostate cancer dominating literature (n = 38). The most common level of evidence for top 100 articles was that of a level 3 study (n = 31). Conclusions: This analysis of research activity has the potential to guide future robotic surgery research trends in the field of urology.

One such technique is light-sheet microscopy, which enables rapid 3D imaging. Our pathology-engineering collaboration has resulted in an open-top light-sheet (OTLS) microscope that is specifically tailored to the needs of pathology practice.  Objective.—:   To present an image atlas of OTLS images of prostate core needle biopsies.  Design.—:   Core needle biopsies (N = 9) were obtained from fresh radical prostatectomy specimens. Each biopsy was fixed in formalin, dehydrated in ethanol, stained with TO-PRO3 and eosin, optically cleared, and imaged using OTLS microscopy. The biopsies were then processed, paraffin embedded, and sectioned. Hematoxylin-eosin and immunohistochemical staining for cytokeratin 5 and cytokeratin 8 was performed.  Results.—:   Benign and neoplastic histologic structures showed high fidelity between OTLS and traditional light microscopy. OTLS microscopy had no discernible effect on hematoxylin-eosin or immunohistochemical staining in this pilot study. The 3D histology information obtained using OTLS microscopy enabled new structural insights, including the observation of cribriform and well-formed gland morphologies within the same contiguous glandular structures, as well as the continuity of poorly formed glands with well-formed glands.  Conclusions.—:   Three-dimensional OTLS microscopy images have a similar appearance to traditional hematoxylin-eosin histology images, with the added benefit of useful 3D structural information. Further studies are needed to continue to document the OTLS appearance of a wide range of tissues and to better understand 3D histologic structures.""","""['Nicholas P Reder', 'Adam K Glaser', 'Erin F McCarty', 'Ye Chen', 'Lawrence D True', 'Jonathan T C Liu']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Arch Pathol Lab Med""","""['A Guide to Perform 3D Histology of Biological Tissues with Fluorescence Microscopy.', 'Nondestructive 3D Pathology Image Atlas of Barrett Esophagus With Open-Top Light-Sheet Microscopy.', 'Comparing histologic evaluation of prostate tissue using nonlinear microscopy and paraffin H&E: a pilot study.', 'P504S immunohistochemical detection in 405 prostatic specimens including 376 18-gauge needle biopsies.', 'The hematoxylin and eosin stain in anatomic pathology-An often-neglected focus of quality assurance in the laboratory.', 'A Guide to Perform 3D Histology of Biological Tissues with Fluorescence Microscopy.', 'Comprehensive Surface Histology of Fresh Resection Margins With Rapid Open-Top Light-Sheet (OTLS) Microscopy.', 'Artificial Intelligence for Clinical Diagnosis and Treatment of Prostate Cancer.', 'Ablating Lgr5-expressing prostatic stromal cells activates the ERK-mediated mechanosensory signaling and disrupts prostate tissue homeostasis.', 'Deconvolution microscopy: A platform for rapid on-site evaluation of fine needle aspiration specimens that enables recovery of the sample.']"""

However, postoperative urinary incontinence still persists and has a significant impact on quality of life. We report the superior results of the detrusorrhaphy technique during RARP that helps achieve early continence. Our prospective study involved 95 consecutive patients who underwent RARP between March 2015 and May 2017; fifty patients underwent RARP using the new detrusorrhaphy technique (group 1) and 45 underwent standard RARP (group 2). The postoperative oncological and functional outcomes were compared between the two groups. The postoperative continence was assessed at 0 day, 1 week, 4 weeks, 8-12 weeks, and 6 months after catheter removal. Continence was defined as the use of no pad over a 24 h period. Mean operative time in groups 1 and 2 were 250 and 220 min, respectively. Intraoperative complications were not encountered in any patient. The continence rates after catheter removal in groups 1 and 2 were 68% and 0% at 0 day, 78% and 17.8% at 1 week, 86% and 64.4% at 4 weeks, 92% and 73.3% at 8-12 weeks, and 100% and 91.1% at 6 months, respectively. In the multivariate analysis, the nerve sparing technique, D'Amico risk groups, and prostate volume were involved in the early recovery of urinary continence. The detrusorrhaphy technique is simple, safe, and feasible, which helped achieve earlier continence. It showed significantly better outcomes than those achieved with the standard RARP technique in terms of urinary incontinence.

Although expressed at lower levels than in CRPC tissues, SLCO-encoded transporters may also play a role in response of primary prostate cancer (PCa) to ADT and biochemical recurrence.  Methods:   We systematically explored expression of the 11 human SLCO genes in a large sample of untreated and ADT-treated normal prostate (NP) and primary PCa tissues, including tumors treated with neoadjuvant abiraterone.  Results:   Transporters with the most recognized role in steroid uptake in PCa, including SLCO2B1 (DHEAS) and 1B3 (testosterone), were consistently detected in primary PCa. SLCO1B3 was nearly 5-fold higher in PCa vs NP with no difference in Gleason 3 vs 4 and no change with ADT. SLCO2B1 was detected at 3-fold lower levels in PCa than NP but was nearly 7-fold higher in Gleason 4 vs Gleason 3 and increased 3-fold following ADT (p < 0.05 for all).  Conclusions:   We observed clear differences in SLCO expression in PCa vs NP samples, in Gleason 4 vs Gleason 3 tumors, and in ADT-treated vs untreated tissues. These findings are hypothesis generating due to small sample size, but suggest that baseline and ADT-induced changes in PCa OATP expression may influence steroid uptake and response to ADT, as well as uptake and response to drugs such as abiraterone and docetaxel which are also subject to OATP-mediated transport and are now being routinely combined with ADT in the metastatic castration sensitive setting.""","""['Mazen Alsinnawi#', 'Ailin Zhang#', 'Daniella Bianchi-Frias', 'John Burns', 'Eunpi Cho', 'Xiaotun Zhang', 'Adam Sowalsky', 'Huihui Ye', 'April E Slee', 'Lawrence True', 'Christopher Porter', 'Mary-Ellen Taplin', 'Steven Balk', 'Peter S Nelson', 'R Bruce Montgomery', 'Elahe A Mostaghel']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Prostate Cancer Prostatic Dis""","""['EAU guidelines on prostate cancer.

Methods and materials:   This is a prospective, multicenter clinical trial of PSMA-HBED PET/CT imaging in patients with early biochemical relapse of prostate carcinoma (median prostate-specific antigen [PSA], 2.55 ng/mL) after definitive prostatectomy (152 patients) or radiation therapy (86 patients) with either no lesions or oligometastatic disease on abdominopelvic CT and bone scan (BS). PSMA-HBED PET/CT scan was performed within 8 weeks of restaging imaging, and all sites of abnormal PSMA-HBED binding determined as probable or definite for prostate carcinoma were included in the analysis. PSMA positivity was assessed for correlation with Gleason Score, PSA level, and PSA doubling time.  Results:   Two hundred thirty-eight patients underwent PSMA-HBED PET/CT imaging. In 199 patients with no lesions on restaging CT and BS, 148 patients (74%) demonstrated PSMA-positive lesions, with 113 patients (57%) being oligometastatic. In 39 patients with oligometastatic lesions on restaging CT and BS, 19 patients (49%) were confirmed as oligometastatic on PSMA PET/CT and 16 patients (41%) were upstaged to polymetastatic. The 4 remaining patients (10%) with sites of possible metastatic disease were not confirmed as having prostate carcinoma. Combining the overall group, there were 183 patients (77%) with PSMA-HBED-positive lesions (682 lesions), suggesting prostate carcinoma, of whom 132 patients (55%) were oligometastatic. In the oligometastatic group, PSMA positivity was limited to the pelvis in 65% of patients, involving either the prostate or nodes (American Joint Committee on Cancer stage N1). This study found a positive correlation between PSMA-HBED positivity and PSA levels; no other factors were statistically significant.  Conclusions:   For patients with biochemical relapse with BS and CT demonstrating either no disease or low-volume disease, there is a high overall prevalence of PSMA PET/CT-positive disease.

We have evaluated a DNN-based algorithm for automatic segmentation of the prostate gland on a large cohort of patient images.  Methods and materials:   Planning-CT data sets for 1114 patients with prostate cancer were retrospectively selected and divided into 2 groups. Group A contained 1104 data sets, with 1 physician-generated prostate gland contour for each data set. Among these image sets, 771 were used for training, 193 for validation, and 140 for testing. Group B contained 10 data sets, each including prostate contours delineated by 5 independent physicians and a consensus contour generated using the STAPLE method in the CERR software package. All images were resampled to a spatial resolution of 1 × 1 × 1.5 mm. A region (128 × 128 × 64 voxels) containing the prostate was selected to train a DNN. The best-performing model on the validation data sets was used to segment the prostate on all testing images. Results were compared between DNN and physician-generated contours using the Dice similarity coefficient, Hausdorff distances, regional contour distances, and center-of-mass distances.  Results:   The mean Dice similarity coefficients between DNN-based prostate segmentation and physician-generated contours for test data in Group A, Group B, and Group B-consensus were 0.85 ± 0.06 (range, 0.65-0.93), 0.85 ± 0.04 (range, 0.80-0.91), and 0.88 ± 0.03 (range, 0.82-0.92), respectively. The Hausdorff distance was 7.0 ± 3.5 mm, 7.3 ± 2.0 mm, and 6.3 ± 2.0 mm for Group A, Group B, and Group B-consensus, respectively. The mean center-of-mass distances for all 3 data set groups were within 5 mm.  Conclusions:   A DNN-based algorithm was used to automatically segment the prostate for a large cohort of patients with prostate cancer. DNN-based prostate segmentations were compared to the consensus contour for a smaller group of patients; the agreement between DNN segmentations and consensus contour was similar to the agreement reported in a previous study. Clinical use of DNNs is promising, but further investigation is warranted.""","""['Chang Liu', 'Stephen J Gardner', 'Ning Wen', 'Mohamed A Elshaikh', 'Farzan Siddiqui', 'Benjamin Movsas', 'Indrin J Chetty']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys""","""['Automated contour propagation of the prostate from pCT to CBCT images via deep unsupervised learning.', 'Contouring variability of human- and deformable-generated contours in radiotherapy for prostate cancer.', 'Fully automatic segmentation on prostate MR images based on cascaded fully convolution network.', 'Clinical evaluation of an MRI-to-ultrasound deformable image registration algorithm for prostate brachytherapy.', 'Investigation and benchmarking of U-Nets on prostate segmentation tasks.', 'Artificial intelligence applications in prostate cancer.', 'External validation of a convolutional neural network for the automatic segmentation of intraprostatic tumor lesions on 68Ga-PSMA PET images.', ""Clinical Validation of Siemens' Syngo.via Automatic Contouring System."", 'Research on Segmentation Technology in Lung Cancer Radiotherapy Based on Deep Learning.', 'Extrathyroidal Extension Prediction of Papillary Thyroid Cancer With Computed Tomography Based Radiomics Nomogram: A Multicenter Study.']"""

It has been reported that TMEPAI functions to suppress TGF-β and androgen signaling but here, we report a novel function of TMEPAI in Wnt signaling suppression. First, we show that TMEPAI significantly inhibits TCF/LEF transcriptional activity stimulated by Wnt3A, LiCl, and β-catenin. Mechanistically, TMEPAI overexpression prevented β-catenin accumulation in the nucleus and TMEPAI knockout in triple negative breast cancer cell lines promoted β-catenin stability and nuclear accumulation together with increased mRNA levels of Wnt target genes AXIN2 and c-MYC. The presence of TGF-β type I receptor kinase inhibitor did not affect the enhanced mRNA expression of AXIN2 in TMEPAI knockout cells.

Methods::   The present study is a real-life study on patients with primary and prior negative prostate biopsies with suspicious PCa. A total of 130 men with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) value >2.5 ng/dL and/or abnormal digital rectal examination (DRE) were included in the study and subjected to mpMRI.

However, there is no extensive study on the antitumor effect of sea cucumber extract on prostate cancer (PCa). TBL-12 is a new sea cucumber extract. In this study, we investigated the in vivo anti-PCa effect of TBL-12 and its in vitro effects on the proliferation, apoptosis, migration, and invasion of the human PCa cell lines LNCaP, 22RV1, PC-3, and DU145, and evaluated its possible mechanisms.  Methods:   Cell proliferation was analyzed by cell counting kit-8 and colony formation assays. Scratch migration assay and transwell invasiveness assay were used to observe TBL-12 effect on the migration and invasion of PCa cells. Matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP-2) and MMP-9 expression and enzymatic activity was determined by Western blot analysis, quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction, and gelatin zymography. Apoptosis level was detected by flow cytometry analysis. Western blot analysis was used to analyze p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and apoptosis pathways. Angiogenic array analysis was used to explore autocrine and paracrine growth factors in PCa cell lines. Xenograft tumor model was built to observe the in vivo anticancer effect.  Results:   TBL-12 could significantly inhibit tumor growth in xenograft PCa mice in vivo, and dramatically inhibit the proliferation, colony formation, migration, and invasiveness of PCa cells in vitro (P < 0.05 and P < 0.001). The expression and enzyme activity of MMP-2 and MMP-9 were significantly suppressed by TBL-12 ( P < 0.01), and decreased phosphorylation level of p38 in PCa cells was detected ( P < 0.001). Furthermore, TBL-12 could reinforce the MMP-2/MMP-9 inhibitory effect of SB203580, a specific inhibitor of the p38 MAPK pathway ( P < 0.05). Besides, TBL-12 could induce the apoptosis of PCa cells by activating caspase-9, caspase-7, and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase and suppressing survivin, and inhibit the secretion of angiogenin, angiopoietin-2, and vascular endothelial growth factor in PCa cells.  Conclusions:   Sea cucumber extract TBL-12 could suppress the proliferation and metastasis of human PCa cells by inhibiting MMP-2 and MMP-9 via blocking the p38 MAPK pathway, inducing apoptosis through intrinsic caspase apoptosis pathway and inhibiting the secretion of angiogenic factors.

The aim of the study was to investigate the diagnostic value of the AroCell TK 210 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) together with free PSA, [-2]proPSA, and Prostate Health Index (PHI) in differentiating PCa from benign urological conditions.  Methods:   Serum samples from 140 patients with PSA values in the range between 2 and 10 µg/L were collected at the Ljubljana University Medical Centre and the Maribor University Medical Centre. Thymidine kinase (TK1) protein levels were determined using the AroCell TK 210 ELISA and PSA-related parameters analysed with commercial assays.  Results:   Serum TK1 protein, total and free PSA, proPSA, PSA density (PSAD), and PHI levels in patients with confirmed PCa were significantly higher than in patients with benign urological conditions (P < 0.05). Overall, the AroCell TK 210 ELISA results showed a significant correlation with PHI ( r = 0.25, P = 0.0031). Receiver-operating characteristic curve analyses were used to compare the area under the curve (AUC) of TK 210 ELISA, PHI, and PSA density. For PHI, the AUC was 0.73, comparable to those of TK 210 ELISA (0.67) and PSAD (0.66), with no significant differences in pairwise comparisons (PHI vs TK 210 ELISA P = 0.32, PHI vs PSAD P = 0.24, and TK 210 ELISA vs PSAD P = 0.95). The AUC for the combination of TK1 plus PSAD was significantly higher than those for the individual PSA-related biomarkers and marginally PHI, while the AUC for the combination of TK1 plus PHI was significantly higher than those for the individual PSA-related biomarkers except for PHI and marginally for PSAD. Total PSA concentration was the only marker, that was significantly higher in patients with an increasing Gleason grade.

However, data has largely been reported in populations with more proinflammatory dietary patterns, whereas there is high diversity in dietary pattern worldwide. The aim of this study was to assess the association between DII scores and the risk for PCa in Vietnam.  Methods:   A case-control study of 652 participants (244 incident PCa patients, 64-75 y of age, and 408 controls, frequency matched for age) was conducted in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, from 2013 to 2015. Habitual diet was ascertained using a validated food frequency questionnaire (FFQ), whereas other factors, including demographic and lifestyle characteristics, were assessed via face-to-face interviews. The daily intake of pro- and anti-inflammatory nutrients for each participant was calculated from the FFQ and used to estimate individuals' energy-adjusted DII (E-DII) scores. Multivariate-adjusted odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated using unconditional logistic regression models.  Results:   Comparing the middle and highest versus lowest tertile of DII scores, there was an increased risk for overall PCa. The OR and associated 95% CI was 2.63 (1.61-4.37) and 3.35 (2.06-5.53), respectively (Ptrend < 0.01). Similar results were found for low-moderate and high-grade PCa. The respective ORs (95% CI) were 3.34 (1.66-7.13) and 5.29 (2.69-11.18), Ptrend < 0.001, and 2.51 (1.40-4.63) and 2.57 (1.43-4.73), Ptrend 0.006.

The common structural characteristics, of the members of the rhodopsin family of GPCRs, have been employed for the construction of a homology model for GnRHR. Structural information from the human β2-adrenergic receptor, as well as rhodopsins have been used in order to create a theoretical model for GnRHR.

The optimal way to manage the hydrogel and rectal structures for plan optimization is therefore of interest. In 13 patients, computerized tomography (CT) scans were taken pre- and post-SpaceOAR© implant. A prescription of 60 Gy in 20 fractions was planned on both scans. Six treatment plans were produced per anonymized dataset using either a structure of rectum plus the hydrogel, termed composite rectum wall (CRW), or rectal wall (RW) as an inverse optimization structure and intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) or volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) as a treatment technique. Dose-volume histogram metrics were compared between plans to determine which optimization structure and treatment technique offered the maximum rectal dose sparing. RW structures offered a statistically significant decrease in rectal dose over CRW structures, whereas the treatment technique (IMRT vs VMAT) did not significantly affect the rectal dose.

Methods:   Studies to assess the antitumour activity and toxicity were performed in a metastatic prostate (PC3) mice model using ICP-MS, nuclear microscopy, elemental analysis and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM).  Results:   TM85 showed low systemic toxicity but no significant tumour reduction, when administered at tolerated dose (20mg/kg) over 10 days. Ru was mainly retained in the liver and less in kidneys, with low accumulation in tumour. Increased bilirubin levels, anomalous Ca and Fe concentrations in liver and mitochondria alterations were indicative of liver injury. The hepatotoxicity observed was less severe than that of cisplatin and no nephrotoxicity was found.  Conclusion:   Under the experimental conditions of this study, TM85 is less toxic than cisplatin, induces similar tumour reduction and avoids the formation of metastatic foci.

For both low- and high-risk disease, Kaplan-Meier analysis for OS in the postmatching cohort did not show any difference in OS between patients treated within clinical trial setting versus patients treated within SEER database (p = 0.176; p = 0.097; respectively). Likewise in multivariate Cox regression analysis, treatment context (clinical trial vs SEER) does not affect OS for either low- or high-risk disease (p = 0.470; p = 0.412; respectively).  Conclusion:   After accounting for possible confounders in baseline characteristics, there was no conclusive evidence of a survival difference between localized prostate cancer patients treated with external beam radiotherapy within routine, real-world settings compared with patients treated within clinical trials.""","""['Omar Abdel-Rahman']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Future Oncol""","""['The need for androgen deprivation therapy in patients with intermediate-risk prostate cancer treated with dose-escalated external beam radiation therapy.', 'Perineural invasion is associated with increased relapse after external beam radiotherapy for men with low-risk prostate cancer and may be a marker for occult, high-grade cancer.', 'Brachytherapy Boost Utilization and Survival in Unfavorable-risk Prostate Cancer.', 'The impact of age at the time of radiotherapy for localized prostate cancer on the development of second primary malignancies.', 'Radiotherapy for prostate cancer: the changing scene.']"""

The aim is to balance the need for the atlas set to represent anatomical diversity with the need to minimize resources required to create a high quality atlas set (such as multiobserver delineation), while retaining access to additional information available for the PA image set.  Methods:   Preprocessing was performed for image standardization, followed by image registration. Clustering was used to select the subset that provided the best coverage of a target dataset as measured by postregistration image intensity similarities. Tests for clustering robustness were performed including repeated clustering runs using different starting seeds and clustering repeatedly using 90% of the target dataset chosen randomly. Comparisons of coverage of a target set (comprising 711 pelvic CT images) were made for atlas sets of five images (chosen from a PA set of 39 pelvic CT and MR images) (a) at random (averaged over 50 random atlas selections), (b) based solely on image similarities within the PA set (representing prospective atlas development), (c) based on similarities within the PA set and between the PA and target dataset (representing retrospective atlas development). Comparisons were also made to coverage provided by the entire PA set of 39 images.  Results:   Exemplar selection was highly robust with exemplar selection results being unaffected by choice of starting seed with very occasional change to one of the exemplar choices when the target set was reduced. Coverage of the target set, as measured by best normalized cross-correlation similarity of target images to any exemplar image, provided by five well-selected atlas images (mean = 0.6497) was more similar to coverage provided by the entire PA set (mean = 0.6658) than randomly chosen atlas subsets (mean = 0.5977). This was true both of the mean values and the shape of the distributions. Retrospective selection of atlases (mean = 0.6497) provided a very small improvement over prospective atlas selection (mean = 0.6431). All differences were significant (P < 1.0E-10).  Conclusions:   Selection of a small representative image set from one dataset can be utilized to develop an atlas set for either retrospective or prospective autosegmentation of a different target dataset. The coverage provided by such a judiciously selected subset has the potential to facilitate propagation of numerous retrospectively defined structures, utilizing additional information available with multimodal imaging in the atlas set, without the need to create large atlas image sets.""","""['Angel Kennedy', 'Jason Dowling', 'Peter B Greer', 'Lois Holloway', 'Michael G Jameson', 'Dale Roach', 'Soumya Ghose', 'David Rivest-Hénault', 'Marco Marcello', 'Martin A Ebert']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Multiatlas-based segmentation with preregistration atlas selection.', 'MR and CT data with multiobserver delineations of organs in the pelvic area-Part of the Gold Atlas project.', 'Comparative study of algorithms for synthetic CT generation from MRI: Consequences for MRI-guided radiation planning in the pelvic region.', 'The effect of morphometric atlas selection on multi-atlas-based automatic brachial plexus segmentation.', 'Semiautomatic robust regression clustering of international trade data.', 'Complex Bone Tumors of the Trunk-The Role of 3D Printing and Navigation in Tumor Orthopedics: A Case Series and Review of the Literature.', 'Increased Dose to Organs in Urinary Tract Associates With Measures of Genitourinary Toxicity in Pooled Voxel-Based Analysis of 3 Randomized Phase III Trials.']"""

Methods:   The local institutional ethics committee approved this retrospective analysis of 301 consecutive PCa patients. Patients were classified as low- or intermediate/high-risk based on clinical parameters and underwent pre-surgical multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging. A PI-RADS v2 assessment category and ESUR EPE score were assigned for each lesion by two readers working in consensus. Histopathologic analysis of the whole-mount radical prostatectomy specimen was the reference standard. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to evaluate the association of PI-RADS v2 assessment category with final histology ≥pT3a PCa.  Results:   For a PI-RADS v2 assessment category threshold of 3, the overall performance for ruling out (sensitivity, negative predictive value, negative likelihood ratio) ≥pT3a PCa was 99%/98%/0.04 and was similar in both the low-risk (96%/97%/0.12; N = 137) and the intermediate/high-risk groups (100%/100%/0.0; N = 164). In univariate analysis, all clinical and tumor characteristics except age were significantly associated with ≥pT3a PCa. In multivariate analysis, PI-RADS v2 assessment categories ≤ 3 had a protective effect relative to categories 4 and 5. The inclusion of ESUR EPE score improved the AUC of ≥pT3a PCa prediction (from 0.73 to 0.86, p = 0.04 in the overall cohort). The impact of PI-RADS v2 assessment category is reflected in a nomogram derived on the basis of our cohort.  Conclusions:   In our cohort, low PI-RADS v2 assessment categories of 3 or less confidently ruled out the presence of ≥pT3a PCa irrespective of clinical risk group.  Key points:   • Our analysis of 301 mp-MRI and RARP specimens showed that the addition of PI-RADS v2 assessment categories to clinical parameters improves the exclusion of ≥pT3a (extraprostatic) prostate cancer. • PI-RADS v2 assessment categories of 1 to 3 are useful for excluding ≥pT3a prostate cancer with a NPV of 98%; such patients can be considered as candidates for less invasive approaches. • The ability to exclude ≥pT3a prostate cancer may improve confidence in choosing nerve-sparing surgery or in avoiding pelvic nodal dissections, and similarly for patients undergoing radiotherapy, in adopting short-course adjuvant hormonal therapy or foregoing prophylactic nodal irradiation.""","""['Sarah Alessi', 'Paola Pricolo', 'Paul Summers', 'Marco Femia', 'Elena Tagliabue', 'Giuseppe Renne', 'Roberto Bianchi', 'Gennaro Musi', 'Ottavio De Cobelli', 'Barbara Alicja Jereczek-Fossa', 'Massimo Bellomi', 'Giuseppe Petralia']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Eur Radiol""","""['PI-RADS v2 and periprostatic fat measured on multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging can predict upgrading in radical prostatectomy pathology amongst patients with biopsy Gleason score 3\u2009+\u20093 prostate cancer.', 'Effect of observation size and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) value in PI-RADS v2.1 assessment category 4 and 5 observations compared to adverse pathological outcomes.', 'Prostate Cancer: The European Society of Urogenital Radiology Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System Criteria for Predicting Extraprostatic Extension by Using 3-T Multiparametric MR Imaging.', 'Extraprostatic extension in prostate cancer: primer for radiologists.', 'A meta-analysis of use of Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System Version 2 (PI-RADS V2) with multiparametric MR imaging for the detection of prostate cancer.', 'Imaging features of the PI-RADS for predicting extraprostatic extension of prostate cancer: systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Negative mpMRI Rules Out Extra-Prostatic Extension in Prostate Cancer before Robot-Assisted Radical Prostatectomy.', 'Selection of patients for nerve sparing surgery in robot-assisted radical prostatectomy.', 'External validation of a magnetic resonance imaging-based algorithm for prediction of side-specific extracapsular extension in prostate cancer.', 'Assessing Extraprostatic Extension with Multiparametric MRI of the Prostate: Mehralivand Extraprostatic Extension Grade or Extraprostatic Extension Likert Scale?']"""

Results:   C-DWIs demonstrated higher rating than a-DWIs for overall image quality despite worsened ghosting. In patients with a biopsy, similar detection rate was observed while conspicuity was better with c-DWI (p < 0.001).

PI-RADS ≥ 4 lesions were assessed for ECE on 2D T2W images using a 5-point Likert scale (1 = no ECE, 5 = definite ECE) and the length of tumour prostatic capsular contact. A second read using 3D T2W images and reformats evaluated ECE and the maximal 3D capsular contact length and surface.  Results:   One hundred six lesions were identified at MRI. ECE was confirmed by histology in 54% (57/106) of lesions and 64% (48/75) of patients. Sensitivity and specificity for 3D T2 reads were 75.4% versus 64.9% (p = 0.058), respectively, and 83.7% versus 85.7% (p = 0.705) for 2D T2 reads, respectively. 3D T2W reads showed significantly higher mean subjective Likert scores of 3.7 ± 1.4 versus 3.3 ± 1.4 (p = 0.001) in ECE-positive lesions and lower mean Likert score of 1.5 ± 1 versus 1.6 ± 0.9 (p = 0.27) in ECE-negative lesions compared with 2D T2W reads. 3D contact significantly increased sensitivity from 59.6 to 73.7% (p = 0.03), whilst maintaining the same specificity of 87.8% (p = 1).

The objective was to explore the relationships between surgeons' self-assessed satisfaction with performed radical prostatectomies and intraoperative factors such as technical difficulties and intraoperative complications as reported by the surgeon subsequent to the operation.  Methods:   We utilized prospectively collected data from the controlled LAPPRO trial where 4003 patients with prostate cancer underwent open (ORP) or robot-assisted laparoscopic (RALP) radical prostatectomy. Patients were included from fourteen centers in Sweden during 2008-2011. Surgeon satisfaction was assessed by questionnaires at the end of each operation. Intraoperative factors included time for the surgical procedure as well as difficulties and complications in various steps of the operation. To model surgeon satisfaction, a mixed effect logistic regression was used. Results were presented as odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI).  Results:   The surgeons were satisfied in 2905 (81%) and dissatisfied in 702 (19%) of the surgical procedures.

Our aims were to assess malignancy risk in a cohort of Australian RA patients relative to the Australian population and to compare cancer risk for patients exposed to TNFi therapy versus a biologic-naïve group.  Methods:   Demographic data for RA participants enrolled in the Australian Rheumatology Association Database (ARAD) before 31 Dec 2012 were matched to national cancer records in May 2016 (linkage complete to 2012). Standardised incidence ratios (SIRs) were used to compare malignancy incidence in TNFi-exposed and biologic-naïve ARAD participants with the Australian general population using site-, age- and sex-specific rates by calendar year. Malignancy incidence in TNFi-exposed participants and biologic-naïve RA patients, were compared using rate ratios (RRs), adjusted for age, sex, smoking, methotrexate use and prior malignancy.  Results:   There were 107 malignancies reported after 10,120 person-years in the TNFi-exposed group (N = 2451) and 49 malignancies after 2232 person-years in the biologic-naïve group (N = 574). Compared with the general population, biologic-naïve RA patients showed an increased risk for overall malignancy (SIR 1.52 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.16, 2.02) prostate cancer (SIR 2.10, 95% CI 1.18, 4.12). The risk of lung cancer was increased for both biologic naïve and TNFi-exposed patients compared with the general population (SIR 2.69 (95% CI 1.43 to 5.68) and SIR 1.69 (95% CI 1.05 to 2.90) respectively). For the TNFi-exposed patients there was an increased risk of lymphoid cancers (SIR 1.82, 95% CI 1.12, 3.18). There were no differences between the exposure groups in the risk of cancer for any of the specific sites examined.  Conclusions:   Overall malignancy incidence was elevated for biologic-naïve RA patients but not for those exposed to TNFi. TNFi exposure did not increase malignancy risk beyond that experienced by biologic-naïve patients. Lung cancer risk was increased for both TNFi-treated and biologic-naïve RA patients compared with the general population suggesting that RA status or RA treatments other than TNFi may be responsible in some way.""","""['Margaret P Staples', 'Lyn March', 'Catherine Hill', 'Marissa Lassere', 'Rachelle Buchbinder']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""BMC Rheumatol""","""['Malignancy risk in Australian rheumatoid arthritis patients treated with anti-tumour necrosis factor therapy: analysis of the Australian Rheumatology Association Database (ARAD) prospective cohort study.', 'The risk of acute coronary syndrome in rheumatoid arthritis in relation to tumour necrosis factor inhibitors and the risk in the general population: a national cohort study.', 'Risk of solid cancer in patients exposed to anti-tumour necrosis factor therapy: results from the British Society for Rheumatology Biologics Register for Rheumatoid Arthritis.', 'Incidence of malignancy in adult patients with rheumatoid arthritis: a meta-analysis.', 'Biologics or tofacitinib for people with rheumatoid arthritis naive to methotrexate: a systematic review and network meta-analysis.', 'Diseases of the musculoskeletal system and connective tissue and risk of breast cancer: Mendelian randomization study in European and East Asian populations.', 'The genetic liability to rheumatoid arthritis may decrease hepatocellular carcinoma risk in East Asian population: a Mendelian randomization study.', 'Management of inflammatory rheumatic diseases during and after malignancies.', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor Inhibitors and the Risk of Cancer among Older Americans with Rheumatoid Arthritis.', 'Prevalence of Cancer in Rheumatoid Arthritis: Epidemiological Study Based on the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES).']"""

Results:   Although biopsy Gleason score (GS) was lower in younger patients (P = 0.033), distribution of pathologic GS was similar between the two groups (13.3% vs. 13.9% for GS ≥ 8, P = 0.191). There was no significant difference in pathologic T stage between the < 50- and ≥ 50-year-old groups (69.3% vs. 68.0% in T2 and 30.7% vs. 32.0% in ≥ T3, P = 0.203). The positive surgical margin rates were similar between the two groups (20.0% vs. 27.6%, P = 0.178). BCR-free survival rates were also similar (P = 0.644) between the two groups, after propensity matching.  Conclusion:   Contrary to prior reports, younger PCa patients did not have more favourable pathologic features on RP specimen and showed similar BCR rates compared to older men. These findings should be considered when making treatment decisions for young Korean patients with PCa.""","""['Mun Su Chung', 'Myungsun Shim', 'Jin Seon Cho', 'Woojin Bang', 'Sun Il Kim', 'Sung Yong Cho', 'Koon Ho Rha', 'Sung Joon Hong', 'Kyo Chul Koo', 'Kwang Suk Lee', 'Byung Ha Chung', 'Seung Hwan Lee']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""J Korean Med Sci""","""['Patients aged more than 70 had higher risk of locally advanced prostate cancers and biochemical recurrence in Korea.', 'Tertiary Gleason pattern in radical prostatectomy specimens is associated with worse outcomes than the next higher Gleason score group in localized prostate cancer.', 'Radical prostatectomy represents an effective treatment in patients with specimen-confined high pathological Gleason score prostate cancer.', 'Outcomes of men aged ≤50 years treated with radical prostatectomy: a retrospective analysis.', 'Long-term cancer control outcomes in patients with clinically high-risk prostate cancer treated with robot-assisted radical prostatectomy: results from a multi-institutional study of 1100 patients.', 'Clinicopathological characteristics of localized prostate cancer in younger men aged\xa0≤\xa050\xa0years treated with radical prostatectomy in the PSA era: A systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Multi-Features Classification of Prostate Carcinoma Observed in Histological Sections: Analysis of Wavelet-Based Texture and Colour Features.']"""

In non-neoplastic immune cells, upregulated Wnt/β-catenin is, however, associated with either immunosuppression or immunostimulation. Therefore, it is difficult to predict the therapeutic impact inhibitors of Wnt/β-catenin signaling will have when combined with cancer immunotherapy. Here, we evaluated the benefit(s) of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling inhibitor XAV939 in the in vitro elimination of LNCaP prostate cancer cells when cocultured with lymphocytes from patients with localized biochemically recurrent prostate cancer (BRPCa). We found that 5 µM XAV939 inhibited β-catenin translocation to the nucleus in LNCaP cells and CD4+ BRPCa lymphocytes without affecting their proliferation and viability. Preconditioning BRPCa lymphocytes with 5 µM XAV939 accelerated the elimination of LNCaP cells during the coculturing. However, during subsequent re-coculturing with fresh LNCaP cells, BRPCa lymphocytes were no longer able to eliminate LNCaP cells unless coculturing and re-coculturing were performed in the presence of 5 µM XAV939. Comparable results were obtained for PC-3 prostate cancer cells.

Carbon ion radiotherapy has a theoretically lower risk of inducing secondary malignancies than photon radiotherapy, but this risk has not been investigated in practice because of the low number of facilities offering such therapy worldwide and the limited data on long-term follow-up because the therapy has only been available since 1994. We aimed to analyse the risk of subsequent primary cancers after treatment with carbon ion radiotherapy in patients with localised prostate cancer and to compare it with that after photon radiotherapy or surgery in this setting.  Methods:   In this retrospective cohort study, we reviewed records of patients who received carbon ion radiotherapy for prostate cancer between June 27, 1995, and July 10, 2012, at the National Institute of Radiological Sciences (NIRS) in Japan. We also retrieved the records of patients diagnosed and treated for prostate cancer between Jan 1, 1994, and Dec 31, 2012, from the Osaka Cancer Registry. Eligible patients had histologically confirmed localised prostate cancer and a minimum follow-up of at least 3 months; no age restrictions were applied. We excluded patients with metastasis, node-positive disease, or locally invasive (T4 stage) prostate cancer, those with previous or synchronous malignancies, and those who received previous radiotherapy or chemotherapy. We did a multivariable analysis to estimate predictors of subsequent cancers after carbon ion radiotherapy treatment. We also used propensity score inverse probability weighting to retrospectively compare the incidence of subsequent cancers in patients with localised prostate cancer treated with carbon beams, photon radiotherapy, or surgery.  Findings:   Of 1580 patients who received carbon radiotherapy for prostate cancer at the NIRS, 1455 (92%) patients met the eligibility criteria. Of 38 594 patients with prostate cancer identified in the Osaka registry, 1983 (5%) patients treated with photon radiotherapy and 5948 (15%) treated with surgery were included. Median follow-up durations were 7·9 years (IQR 5·9-10·0) for patients who received carbon ion radiotherapy (after limiting the database to 10-year maximum follow-up), 5·7 years (4·5-6·4) for patients who received photon radiotherapy, and 6·0 years (5·0-8·6) for those who received surgery. 234 subsequent primary cancers were diagnosed in the carbon ion radiotherapy cohort; some patients developed several tumours. On multivariable analysis, age (p=0·0021 for 71-75 years vs ≤60 years; p=0·012 for >75 years vs ≤60 years) and smoking (p=0·0005) were associated with a higher risk of subsequent primary cancers in patients treated with carbon ion radiotherapy. In the propensity score-weighted analyses, carbon ion radiotherapy was associated with a lower risk of subsequent primary cancers than photon radiotherapy (hazard ratio [HR] 0·81 [95% CI 0·66-0·99]; p=0·038) or surgery (HR 0·80 [0·68-0·95]; p=0·0088), whereas photon radiotherapy was associated with a higher risk of subsequent primary cancers than surgery (HR 1·18 [1·02-1·36]; p=0·029).  Interpretation:   Our analysis suggests that patients with localised prostate cancer treated with carbon ion radiotherapy appear to have a lower risk of subsequent primary cancers than those treated with photon radiotherapy. Although prospective evaluation with longer follow-up is warranted to support these results, our data supports a wider adoption of carbon ion radiotherapy for patients with expected long-term overall survival or those with poor outcomes after receiving conventional treatments.

However, the molecular targets of FKB in prostate cancer cells remain unknown.  Methods:   An in vitro NEDD8 Initiation Conjugation Assay was used to evaluate the neddylation inhibitory activity of FKB. Molecular docking and a cellular thermal shift assay were performed to assess the direct interaction between FKB and the NEDD8 activating enzyme (NAE) complex. Protein neddylation, ubiqutination, stability and expression in cells were assessed with immunoprecipitation and Western blotting methods using specific antibodies. Deletion and site specific mutants and siRNAs were used to evaluate deep mechanisms by which FKB induces Skp2 degradation. Cell growth inhibition and apoptosis induction were measured by MTT, ELISA and Western blotting methods.  Results:   FKB inhibits NEDD8 conjugations to both Cullin1 and Ubc12 in prostate cancer cell lines and Ubc12 neddylation in an in vitro assay. Molecular docking study and a cellular thermal shift assay reveal that FKB interacts with the regulatory subunit (i.e. APP-BP1) of the NAE. In addition, FKB causes Skp2 degradation in an ubiquitin and proteasome dependent manner. Overexpression of dominant-negative cullin1 (1-452), K720R mutant (the neddylation site) Cullin1 or the F-box deleted Skp2 that losses its binding to the Skp1/Cullin1 complex causes the resistance to FKB-induced Skp2 degradation, whereas siRNA knock-down of Cdh1, a known E3 ligase of Skp2 for targeted degradation, didn't attenuate the effect of FKB on Skp2 degradation. These results suggest that degradation of Skp2 by FKB is involved in a functional Cullin1. Furthermore, proteasome inhibitors Bortezomib and MG132 transcriptionally down-regulate the expression of Skp2, and their combinations with FKB result in enhanced inhibitory effects on the growth of prostate cancer cell lines via synergistic down-regulation of Skp2 and up-regulation of p27/Kip1 and p21/WAF1 protein expression. FKB also selectively inhibits the growth of RB deficient cells with high expression of Skp2.  Conclusion:   These findings provide a rationale for further investigating combination of FKB and Bortezomib for treatment of RB deficient, castration-resistant prostate cancer.""","""['Xuesen Li', 'Victor Pham', 'Matthew Tippin', 'Dongjun Fu', 'Raymond Rendon', 'Liankun Song', 'Edward Uchio', 'Bang H Hoang', 'Xiaolin Zi']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Cell Commun Signal""","""['Flavokawain A induces deNEDDylation and Skp2 degradation leading to inhibition of tumorigenesis and cancer progression in the TRAMP transgenic mouse model.', 'Gartanin is a novel NEDDylation inhibitor for induction of Skp2 degradation, FBXW2 expression, and autophagy.', 'Regulation of neddylation and deneddylation of cullin1 in SCFSkp2 ubiquitin ligase by F-box protein and substrate.', 'Targeting the neddylation pathway in cells as a potential therapeutic approach for diseases.', 'Targeting DCN1-UBC12 Protein-Protein Interaction for Regulation of Neddylation Pathway.', 'Targeting NEDD8-activating enzyme for cancer therapy: developments, clinical trials, challenges and future research directions.', 'Flavokawain A is a natural inhibitor of PRMT5 in bladder cancer.', 'Flavokawain A Reduces Tumor-Initiating Properties and Stemness of Prostate Cancer.', 'Flavokawain B Weakens Gastric Cancer Progression via the TGF-β1/SMAD4 Pathway and Attenuates M2 Macrophage Polarization.', 'Biological Activity, Hepatotoxicity, and Structure-Activity Relationship of Kavalactones and Flavokavins, the Two Main Bioactive Components in Kava (Piper methysticum).']"""

Patients and methods:   A retrospective analysis of 56 patients with biopsy Gleason score 6 PCa who underwent prebiopsy mp-MRI and radical prostatectomy (RP) between November 2013 and March 2018 was conducted. Two radiologists performed PI-RADS v2 score evaluation and different fat measurements on mp-MRI. The associations amongst clinical information, PI-RADS v2 score, different fat parameters and pathologic findings were analyzed. A nomogram predicting upgrading was established based on the results of logistic regression analysis.  Results:   A total of 38 (67.9%) patients were upgraded to Gleason ≥7 disease on RP specimens. Prostate-specific antigen density (PSAD) (p < .001), positive core (p < .001), single-core positivity (p = .039), PI-RADS score (p < .001), front PPF area (p = .007) and front-to-total ratio (the ratio of front PPF area to total contour area) (p < .001) were risk factors for upgrading.

This may contribute to the lower levels of aggressive prostate cancer (PCa) observed in patients with high serum vitamin D. The small noncoding RNA (ncRNA) landscape includes many other RNA species that remain uncharacterized in prostate epithelium and their potential regulation by vitamin D is unknown.  Methods:   Laser capture microdissection (LCM) followed by small-RNA sequencing was used to identify ncRNAs in the prostate epithelium of tissues from a vitamin D-supplementation trial. VDR chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing was performed to identify vitamin D genomic targets in primary prostate epithelial cells.  Results:   Isolation of epithelium by LCM increased sample homogeneity and captured more diversity in ncRNA species compared with publicly available small-RNA sequencing data from benign whole prostate. An abundance of PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) was detected in normal prostate epithelium. The obligate binding partners of piRNAs, PIWI-like (PIWIL) proteins, were also detected in prostate epithelium. High prostatic vitamin D levels were associated with increased expression of piRNAs. VDR binding sites were located near several ncRNA biogenesis genes and genes regulating translation and differentiation.  Conclusions:   Benign prostate epithelium expresses both piRNA and PIWIL proteins, suggesting that these small ncRNA may serve an unknown function in the prostate.

Results:   The nuclear expression levels of tSTAT3, pSTAT3727 , and pSTAT3705 in the epithelial cells of benign glands were significantly higher than in the cancerous glands.

Early detection of PCa is essential for clinical decision making, and reducing metastasis and mortality rates. The current approach for PCa diagnosis is histopathologic analysis of core biopsies taken under transrectal ultrasound guidance (TRUS-guided). Both TRUS-guided systematic biopsy and MR-TRUS-guided fusion biopsy have limitations in accurately identifying PCa, intraoperatively. There is a need to augment this process by visualizing highly probable areas of PCa. Temporal enhanced ultrasound (TeUS) has emerged as a promising modality for PCa detection. Prior work focused on supervised classification of PCa verified by gold standard pathology. Pathology labels are noisy, and data from an entire core have a single label even when significantly heterogeneous. Additionally, supervised methods are limited by data from cores with known pathology, and a significant portion of prostate data is discarded without being used. We provide an end-to-end unsupervised solution to map PCa distribution from TeUS data using an innovative representation learning method, deep neural maps. TeUS data are transformed to a topologically arranged hyper-lattice, where similar samples are closer together in the lattice. Therefore, similar regions of malignant and benign tissue in the prostate are clustered together. Our proposed method increases the number of training samples by several orders of magnitude. Data from biopsy cores with known labels are used to associate the clusters with PCa.

Methods:   The expression of CDC20, CD44, β-catenin were examined in prostate cancer specimens by immunohistochemistry assay, the role of CDC20 on the stem-like properties of prostate CSCs was accessed by real-time quantitive PCR, spheroid formation, in vitro and in vivo limiting dilution assay.  Finding:   CDC20 was associated with malignant progression of prostate cancer, the patients with both high expression CDC20 and CD44 or β-catenin were associated with more aggressive clinicopathological features and poor prognosis.

Of note, expression of those MMPs was directly correlated with SST5TMD4 in several cancer-derived cell lines (ie neuroendocrine tumors and prostate, breast, and liver cancers). Moreover, incubation with SST5TMD4-derived peptides enhanced malignancy features in all cancer cell types tested (ie proliferation, migration, etc.) and blunted the antiproliferative response to somatostatin in QGP-1 cells, acting probably through PI3K/AKT and/or MEK/ERK signaling pathways and the modulation of key cancer-associated genes (eg MMPs, MKI67, ACTR2/3, CD24/44).

All had histological confirmation of PC recurrence, with metastatic disease excluded using pelvic magnetic resonance imaging, a bone scan, and/or positron emission tomography/computed tomography. Progression-free survival was 74%, 48%, and 36% at 12, 24, and 36mo after surgery, respectively. The 12-mo continence rate was 83%. There were no intraoperative complications and no major postoperative complications. On multivariable analysis, only infield recurrence (hazard ratio [HR] 3.77, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.11-12.85; p=0.03) and pT3b stage (HR 5.0, 95% CI 1.53-16.39; p=0.008) were independent predictors of recurrence. This study represents the largest series of salvage surgery after FT and shows that this approach is safe with no increase in toxicity when compared to primary RALP. Men identified as having infield recurrence after FT appear to have phenotypically aggressive disease and should be counselled regarding the potential need for a multimodal therapeutic approach. PATIENT SUMMARY: Robotic surgery after focal therapy for prostate cancer is safe and achieves postoperative continence results similar to those for robotic radical prostatectomy in treatment-naïve patients. However, if the cancer recurrence is within the previously treated field, the oncological prognosis seems to be worse.""","""['Lorenzo Marconi', 'Thomas Stonier', 'Rafael Tourinho-Barbosa', 'Caroline Moore', 'Hashim U Ahmed', 'Xavier Cathelineau', 'Mark Emberton', 'Rafael Sanchez-Salas', 'Paul Cathcart']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Eur Urol""","""['Will Favourable Functional Results with Salvage Robot-assisted Laparoscopic Radical Prostatectomy Increase the Uptake of Primary Focal Therapy for Localised Prostate Cancer?', 'Re: Lorenzo Marconi, Thomas Stonier, Rafael Tourinho-Barbosa, et al.

At the present time, several drugs and molecular diagnostic tools conjugated with selective PSMA ligands are actively evaluated in different preclinical and clinical trials. In the current work, we discuss design, synthesis and a preliminary biological evaluation of PSMA-specific small-molecule carrier equipped by Doxorubicin (Dox). We have introduced an unstable azo-linker between Dox and the carrier hence the designed compound does release the active substance inside cancer cells thereby providing a relatively high Dox concentration in nuclei and a relevant cytotoxic effect. In contrast, we have also synthesized a similar conjugate with a stable amide linker and it did not release the drug at all. This compound was predominantly accumulated in cytoplasm and did not cause cell death. Preliminary in vivo evaluation has showed good efficiency for the degradable conjugate against PC3-PIP(PSMA+)-containing xenograft mine. Thus, we have demonstrated that the conjugate can be used as a template to design novel analogues with improved targeting, anticancer activity and lower rate of potential side effects. 3D molecular docking study has also been performed to elucidate the underlying mechanism of binding and to further optimization of the linker area for improving the target affinity.""","""['Yan A Ivanenkov', 'Alexey E Machulkin', 'Anastasia S Garanina', 'Dmitry A Skvortsov', 'Anastasia A Uspenskaya', 'Ekaterina V Deyneka', 'Alexander V Trofimenko', 'Elena K Beloglazkina', 'Nikolay V Zyk', 'Victor E Koteliansky', 'Dmitry S Bezrukov', 'Anastasia V Aladinskaya', 'Nataliya S Vorobyeva', 'Maria M Puchinina', 'Grigory K Riabykh', 'Alina A Sofronova', 'Alexander S Malyshev', 'Alexander G Majouga']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Bioorg Med Chem Lett""","""[""Corrigendum to 'Synthesis and biological evaluation of Doxorubicin-containing conjugate targeting PSMA' Bioor.

Here, we aimed to develop a novel multimarker model for prediction of biochemical recurrence (BCR) after curatively intended radical prostatectomy (RP), based on minimally invasive sampling of blood and urine. We initially measured the levels of 45 selected miRNAs by RT-qPCR in exosome enriched cell-free urine samples collected prior to RP from 215 PC patients (Cohort 1, training). We trained a novel logistic regression model (pCaP), comprising five urine miRNAs (miR-151a-5p, miR-204-5p, miR-222-3p, miR-23b-3p and miR-331-3p) and serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA), which significantly predicted time to BCR in Cohort 1 (univariate Cox regression analysis: HR = 3.12, p < 0.001). Next, using the same exact numeric cutoff for dichotomization as trained in Cohort 1, we tested and successfully validated the prognostic potential of pCaP in two additional cohorts, including 199 (Cohort 2, HR = 2.24, p = 0.002) and 205 (Cohort 3, HR = 2.15, p = 0.004) RP patients, respectively. pCaP remained a significant predictor of BCR, also after adjustment for pathological T-stage, surgical margin status and Gleason grade group (p < 0.05 in multivariate Cox regression analysis: HR = 2.72, 1.94 and 1.83 for Cohorts 1, 2 and 3, respectively). Additionally, pCaP scores correlated positively with the established clinical risk stratification nomogram CAPRA in all three PC cohorts (Pearson's rho: 0.45, 0.39 and 0.44). Together, our results suggest that the minimally invasive pCaP model could potentially be used in the future to improve PC risk stratification and to guide more personalized treatment decisions.

However, development and validation of methods for focal therapy planning are still lagging.  Purpose:   To evaluate the diagnostic accuracy on lesion, region-of-interest (ROI), and voxel level of IMPROD biparametric prostate MRI (bpMRI) for PCa detection in men with a clinical suspicion of PCa who subsequently underwent radical prostatectomy.  Study type:   Prospective single-institution clinical trial (NCT01864135).  Population:   Sixty-four men who underwent radical prostatectomy after IMPROD bpMRI performed in prebiopsy settings.  Field strength/sequence:   IMPROD bpMRI consisted of T2 -weighted imaging (T2 w) and three separate diffusion-weighted imaging acquisitions with an average acquisition time of 15 minutes.  Assessment:   The diagnostic accuracy of prospectively reported manual cancer delineations and regions increased with 3D dilation were evaluated on the voxel level (volume of 1.17 mm3 , 1 mm3 , 125 mm3 ) as well as the 36 ROI level. Only PCa lesions with a diameter ≥ 5 mm or any Gleason Grade 4 were analyzed. All data and protocols are freely available at: http://petiv.utu.fi/improd STATISTICAL TESTS: Sensitivity, specificity, accuracy.  Results:   In total, 99 PCa lesions were identified. Forty (40%, 40/99) had a Gleason score (GS) of >3 + 4. Twenty-eight PCa lesions (28%, 28/99) were missed by IMPROD bpMRI, three (7.5%, 3/40) with GS >3 + 4. 3D dilation of manual cancer delineations in all directions by ~10-12 mm (corresponding to the Hausdorff distance) was needed to achieve sensitivity approaching 100% on a voxel level.  Data conclusion:   IMPROD bpMRI had a high sensitivity on lesion level for PCa with GS >3 + 4. Increasing 3D lesion delineations by ~10-12 mm (corresponding to the Hausdorff distance) was needed to achieve high sensitivity on the voxel level.

Thus, we evaluated the incidence and biological behavior of subsequent BCa and related survival in patients who underwent radiation therapy for prostate cancer (PCa).  Methods:   A total of 530,581 patients in the surveillance, epidemiology, and end results database with localized PCa between 1988 and 2013 were identified. PCa treatments included radical prostatectomy (RP), external beam radiotherapy (EBRT), radioactive implants (RI), and combined EBRT and RI (EBRI). A multivariable competing risk analysis based on a proportional sub distribution hazards model was used to determine the impact of different radiotherapy modalities on BCa incidence and specific mortality.  Results:   Incidence of BCa was significantly high in patients treated with EBRT, RI, and EBRI vs. RP [sub distribution hazard ratio (SHR) 1.41, P < 0.001; SHR 1.58, P < 0.001; SHR 1.56, P < 0.001, respectively].

Methods:   We used statistics derived from the Niigata Cancer Center CVD Study (2015) as well as population estimates from the National Cancer Center's Cancer Registry and Statistics survey of 2017 for convenience. We simply multiplied the projected number of cancer patients through the year 2039 by the CVD prevalence in 2015, with patients classified by sex, age, and cancer type to estimate the number of cancer patients with CVD.  Results:   The total number of Japanese cancer patients with CVD was 253,000 in 2015 and is predicted to increase rapidly by 30,000 in 2020 and peak at 313,000 in 2030-2034.

The immunohistochemical staining and Western blot analysis revealed significant overexpression of PSMA in tumor and low expression in salivary gland and kidney. Conclusion: A decrease in the MA level of the injected 18F-PSMA-1007 solution resulted in decreased uptake in tumor and, to a greater degree, in normal salivary gland. Thus, there is a possibility of minimizing the adverse effects in salivary gland by setting an appropriate MA level in PSMA-targeting therapy.""","""['Fumihiko Soeda', 'Tadashi Watabe', 'Sadahiro Naka', 'Yuwei Liu', 'Genki Horitsugi', 'Oliver C Neels', 'Klaus Kopka', 'Mitsuaki Tatsumi', 'Eku Shimosegawa', 'Frederik L Giesel', 'Jun Hatazawa']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""J Nucl Med""","""['More advantages in detecting bone and soft tissue metastases from prostate cancer using 18F-PSMA PET/CT.', 'Biochemical Recurrence of Prostate Cancer: Initial Results with 18FPSMA-1007 PET/CT.', 'Direct in vivo comparison of 18FPSMA-1007 with 68GaGa-PSMA-11 and 18FAlF-PSMA-11 in mice bearing PSMA-expressing xenografts.', 'Diagnostic performance of 18F-PSMA-1007 PET/CT in patients with biochemical recurrent prostate cancer.', 'Intraindividual Comparison of 18F-PSMA-1007 with Renally Excreted PSMA Ligands for PSMA PET Imaging in Patients with Relapsed Prostate Cancer.', 'The preclinical study of 177Lu-DOTA-LTVSPWY as a potential therapeutic agent against HER2 overexpressed cancer.', 'Preclinical Evaluation of a Companion Diagnostic Radiopharmaceutical, 18FPSMA-1007, in a Subcutaneous Prostate Cancer Xenograft Mouse Model.', 'Targeted α-therapy using astatine (211At)-labeled PSMA1, 5, and 6: a preclinical evaluation as a novel compound.', 'Preclinical comparative study of 18FAlF-PSMA-11 and 18FPSMA-1007 in varying PSMA expressing tumors.', ""Sublingual Atropine Administration as a Tool to Decrease Salivary Glands' PSMA-Ligand Uptake: A Preclinical Proof of Concept Study Using 68GaGa-PSMA-11.""]"""

Methods: The current analysis was performed as part of a prospective, multicenter trial on 18F-FCH or 68Ga-PSMA PET, mpMR, and wbMR. Eligible men had an elevated level of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) (>0.2 ng/mL) and high-risk features (Gleason score > 7, PSA doubling time < 10 mo, or PSA > 1.0 ng/mL) with negative or equivocal conventional imaging results. PET was interpreted with mpMR and wbMR in consensus by 2 radiologists and compared with prospective interpretation of PET or MRI alone. Performance measures of each modality (PET, MRI, and PET/mpMR-wbMR) were compared for each radiotracer and each individual patient (for 18F-FCH, or 68Ga-PSMA for patients who had 68Ga-PSMA PET) and to a composite reference standard. Results: There were 86 patients with PET (18F-FCH [n = 76] and/or 68Ga-PSMA [n = 26]) who had mpMR and wbMR. Local tumor recurrence was detected in 20 of 76 (26.3%) on 18F-FCH PET/mpMR, versus 11 of 76 (14.5%) on 18F-FCH PET (P = 0.039), and in 11 of 26 (42.3%) on 68Ga-PSMA PET/mpMR, versus 6 of 26 (23.1%) on 68Ga-PSMA PET (P = 0.074). Per patient, PET/mpMR was more often positive for local tumor recurrence than PET (P = 0.039) or mpMR (P = 0.019). There were 20 of 86 patients (23.3%) with regional nodal metastases on both PET/wbMR and PET (P = 1.0) but only 12 of 86 (14%) on wbMR (P = 0.061). Similarly, there were more nonregional metastases detected on PET/wbMR than on PET (P = 0.683) or wbMR (P = 0.074), but these differences did not reach significance. Compared with the composite reference standard for the detection of disease beyond the prostatic fossa, PET/wbMR, PET, and wbMR had sensitivity of 50%, 50%, and 8.3%, respectively, and specificity of 97.1%, 97.1%, and 94.1%, respectively. Conclusion: Interpretation of PET/mpMR resulted in a higher detection rate for local tumor recurrence in the prostatic bed in men with biochemical failure after radical prostatectomy. However, the addition of wbMR to 18F-FCH or 68Ga-PSMA PET did not improve detection of regional or distant metastases.""","""['Ur Metser', 'Sue Chua', 'Bao Ho', 'Shonit Punwani', 'Edward Johnston', 'Frederic Pouliot', 'Noam Tau', 'Asmaa Hawsawy', 'Reut Anconina', 'Glenn Bauman', 'Rodney J Hicks', 'Andrew Weickhardt', 'Ian D Davis', 'Greg Pond', 'Andrew M Scott', 'Nina Tunariu', 'Harbir Sidhu', 'Louise Emmett']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""J Nucl Med""","""['Prospective, Multisite, International Comparison of 18F-Fluoromethylcholine PET/CT, Multiparametric MRI, and 68Ga-HBED-CC PSMA-11 PET/CT in Men with High-Risk Features and Biochemical Failure After Radical Prostatectomy: Clinical Performance and Patient Outcomes.', 'More advantages in detecting bone and soft tissue metastases from prostate cancer using 18F-PSMA PET/CT.', 'Prospective comparison of whole-body MRI and 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT for the detection of biochemical recurrence of prostate cancer after radical prostatectomy.', 'Use of gallium-68 prostate-specific membrane antigen positron-emission tomography for detecting lymph node metastases in primary and recurrent prostate cancer and location of recurrence after radical prostatectomy: an overview of the current literature.', 'Current status of theranostics in prostate cancer.', 'Up-to-Date Imaging and Diagnostic Techniques for Prostate Cancer: A Literature Review.', 'Influence of molecular imaging on patient selection for treatment intensification prior to salvage radiation therapy for prostate cancer: a post hoc analysis of the PROPS trial.', 'Defining Prostatic Vascular Pedicle Recurrence and the Anatomy of Local Recurrence of Prostate Cancer on Prostate-specific Membrane Antigen Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography.', 'Predictors of 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT Positivity in Patients with Biochemical Recurrence of Prostate Cancer After Local Therapy.', 'F-18 fluorocholine positron emission tomography- computed tomography in initial staging and recurrence evaluation of prostate carcinoma: A prospective comparative study with diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging and whole-body skeletal scintigraphy.']"""

Application of rectal and bowel constraints may reduce risks of side-effects. We evaluated associations between intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) dose-volume data and long-term gastrointestinal toxicity.  Materials and methods:   Data from a single-centre dose-escalation trial of PLN-IMRT were analysed, including conventionally fractionated (CFRT) and hypofractionated (HFRT) radiotherapy schedules. Associations between volumes of rectum and bowel receiving specified doses and clinician- and patient-reported toxicity outcomes were investigated independently. A metric, δ median (δM), was defined as the difference in the medians of a volume between groups with and without toxicity at a specified dose and was used to test for statistically significant differences.  Results:   Constraints were respected in most patients and, when exceeded, led to higher rates of gastrointestinal toxicity. Biologically relevant associations between rectum dose-points and toxicity were more numerous with both mild and moderate toxicity thresholds, but statistical significance was limited after correction for false discovery rate. Rectal V50Gy (CFRT) associated with grade 2+ bleeding; bowel V43Gy and V47 (HFRT/4 days/week schedule) associated with patient-reported loose stools and diarrhoea, respectively. Further investigation showed that CFRT patients with rectal bleeding had a mean rectal V50Gy above the treatment planning constraint.  Conclusions:   When dose-volume parameters are kept below tight constraints, toxicity is low. Residual dosimetry loses much of its predictive power for gastrointestinal toxicity in the setting of PLN-IMRT for prostate cancer. We have benchmarked dose-volume constraints for safely delivering PLN-IMRT using CFRT or HFRT.""","""['M R Ferreira', 'K Thomas', 'L Truelove', 'A Khan', 'C Parker', 'D P Dearnaley', 'S Gulliford']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Clin Oncol (R Coll Radiol)""","""['Intensity-modulated radiotherapy allows escalation of the radiation dose to the pelvic lymph nodes in patients with locally advanced prostate cancer: preliminary results of a phase I dose escalation study.', 'Different rectal toxicity tolerance with and without simultaneous conventionally-fractionated pelvic lymph node treatment in patients receiving hypofractionated prostate radiotherapy.', 'Intensity modulated radiotherapy for high risk prostate cancer based on sentinel node SPECT imaging for target volume definition.', 'Dose-volume analysis of predictors for chronic rectal toxicity after treatment of prostate cancer with adaptive image-guided radiotherapy.', 'Interventions to reduce acute and late adverse gastrointestinal effects of pelvic radiotherapy for primary pelvic cancers.', 'Heuristic estimation of the α/β ratio for a cohort of Mexican patients with prostate cancer treated with external radiotherapy techniques.', 'Effect of patient thickness on acute gastrointestinal toxicities following radiotherapy for prostate cancer.']"""

Despite the identification of this subclass of prostate cancers, no personalized therapeutic strategies have achieved clinical implementation. Kinases are attractive therapeutic targets as signaling networks are commonly perturbed in cancers. The impact of elevated ERG expression on kinase signaling networks in prostate cancer has not been investigated. Resolution of this issue may identify novel therapeutic approaches for ERG-positive prostate cancers. In this study, we used quantitative mass spectrometry-based kinomic profiling to identify ERG-mediated changes to cellular signaling networks. We identified 76 kinases that were differentially expressed and/or phosphorylated in DU145 cells engineered to express ERG. In particular, the Traf2 and Nck-interacting kinase (TNIK) was markedly upregulated and phosphorylated on multiple sites upon ERG overexpression. Importantly, TNIK has not previously been implicated in prostate cancer. To validate the clinical relevance of these findings, we characterized expression of TNIK and TNIK phosphorylated at serine 764 (pS764) in a localized prostate cancer patient cohort and showed that nuclear enrichment of TNIK (pS764) was significantly positively correlated with ERG expression. Moreover, TNIK protein levels were dependent upon ERG expression in VCaP cells and primary cells established from a prostate cancer patient-derived xenograft. Furthermore, reduction of TNIK expression and activity by silencing TNIK expression or using the TNIK inhibitor NCB-0846 reduced cell viability, colony formation and anchorage independent growth. Therefore, TNIK represents a novel and actionable therapeutic target for ERG-positive prostate cancers that could be exploited to develop new treatments for these patients.""","""['Rachel S Lee', 'Luxi Zhang', 'Adeline Berger', 'Mitchell G Lawrence', 'Jiangning Song', 'Birunthi Niranjan', 'Rebecca G Davies', 'Natalie L Lister', 'Shahneen K Sandhu', 'Mark A Rubin', 'Gail P Risbridger', 'Renea A Taylor', 'David S Rickman', 'Lisa G Horvath', 'Roger J Daly']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Neoplasia""","""['Significance of the TMPRSS2:ERG gene fusion in prostate cancer.', 'A novel aminothiazole KY-05009 with potential to inhibit Traf2- and Nck-interacting kinase (TNIK) attenuates TGF-β1-mediated epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in human lung adenocarcinoma A549 cells.', 'ERG is a critical regulator of Wnt/LEF1 signaling in prostate cancer.', 'Emergence of TNIK inhibitors in cancer therapeutics.', 'Targeting the Wnt signaling pathway in colorectal cancer.', 'Expression analysis of TRAF2‑ and NCK‑interacting protein kinase (TNIK) and phosphorylated TNIK in papillary thyroid carcinoma.', 'Advancements in Oncoproteomics Technologies: Treading toward Translation into Clinical Practice.', 'SARS-CoV-2 replication in airway epithelia requires motile cilia and microvillar reprogramming.', 'Computational study on new natural compound inhibitors of Traf2 and Nck-interacting kinase (TNIK).', 'Signaling pathways and targeted therapies in lung squamous cell carcinoma: mechanisms and clinical trials.']"""

Data elements included in the import template were drawn from existing International Consortium for Health Outcome Measurement variables and refined to ensure accurate benchmarking as well as feasibility in data completeness. The data set was organized in accordance with the prostate cancer care trajectory. Key considerations in developing the data transfer platform included import file format, process of input validation, and technical provisions.

The goal of this study is to present the results of the first fifty-five patients submitted to Anterograde Anatomic Radical Retropubic Prostatectomy technique (R2PA2), without adding complexity or cost.  Materials and methods:   Fifty-five eligible men with localized prostate cancer underwent R2PA2 from January, 2016 to December, 2017. The technique was previously described (2): the main surgical steps were anterograde dissection, ligation of the dorsal vascular complex without dividing, preservation of the bladder neck, nerve sparing, preservation of Denonvilliers' fascia and confection of the running suture anastomosis. All patients were operated on by second-year residents.  Results:   All procedures were completed as planned, but one converted to retrograde prostatectomy (mean duration, 163.40 minutes; hospital stay, 4 days with 4.20 days of drainage; indwelling vesical catheterization of 9.80 days). Positive surgical margin was found in six T2 staging patient (10.90%) and five T3 (9.10%). Biochemical PSA recurrence occurred in three patients (5.50%). Twenty-four (43.60%) were continent immediately after indwelling catheter removal, seventeen (30.90%) did not wear a pad at one postoperative month while eighteen (30%) used only one safety pad. Five minor complications occurred.  Conclusion:   We were able to perform R2PA2 allowing men who do not have access to this new technology to be operated on with the same technique used in robotic surgery. This method was reproducible by low-volume prostate cancer surgeons; help inexperienced surgeons to develop skills valuable to future training with robotic techniques.

Current evidence suggests limited diagnostic value of the 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT in PSA-levels ≤0.3ng/mL. Experimental data have demonstrated na increase in PSMA-expression in PCa metastases by androgen deprivation in vitro. The aim of the current study was to investigate a possible enhancing effect of PSMA with low-dose androgen deprivation in patients with BCR and low PSA-levels.  Materials and methods:   Five patients with PCa and BCR, following radical prostatectomy, underwent 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT. A consecutive 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT was performed 6 to 11 days after injection of 80mg of Degarelix (Firmagon®). We recorded PSA and testosterone serum-levels and changes of PSMA-uptake in 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT images.  Results:   Median PSA prior 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT was 0.27ng/mL. All patients had a decrease in testosterone serum levels from median 2.95μg/l to 0.16μg/l following Degarelix injection. We observed an increase in the standardized uptake value (SUV) in PSMA-positive lymphogenous and osseous lesions in two patients following androgen deprivation. In another two patients, no PSMA positive signals were detected in either the fi rst or the second scan.  Conclusion:   Our preliminary results of this feasibility assessment indicate a possible enhancing effect of PSMA-imaging induced by low-dose ADT. Despite several limitations and the small number of patients, this could be a new approach to improve staging by 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT in PCa patients with BCR after primary therapy. Further prospective studies with larger number of patients are needed to validate our findings.""","""['Conrad Leitsmann', 'Paul Thelen', 'Marianne Schmid', 'Johannes Meller', 'Carsten-Oliver Sahlmann', 'Birgit Meller', 'Lutz Trojan', 'Arne Strauss']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Int Braz J Urol""","""['More advantages in detecting bone and soft tissue metastases from prostate cancer using 18F-PSMA PET/CT.', '68Ga-labelled PSMA ligand HBED-CC PET/CT imaging in patients with recurrent prostate cancer.', '68Ga-PSMA PET/CT in Patients with Rising Prostatic-Specific Antigen After Definitive Treatment of Prostate Cancer: Detection Efficacy and Diagnostic accuracy.', 'The role of 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT scan in biochemical recurrence after primary treatment for prostate cancer: a systematic review of the literature.', 'PET/CT With 68Ga-PSMA in Prostate Cancer: Radiopharmaceutical Background and Clinical Implications.', 'Bipolar Androgen Therapy: When Excess Fuel Extinguishes the Fire.', 'The Role of PSMA PET/CT in the Primary Diagnosis and Follow-Up of Prostate Cancer-A Practical Clinical Review.', 'PET-CT in Clinical Adult Oncology-IV.

To further reveal the mechanism of CPA contributing to prostate cancer, we conducted analysis on gene expression profile of E-GEOD-42913 to identify attractor modules by integrating systemic module inference with attract method.  Methods:   First, case and control protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks were inferred based on Spearman correlation coefficient; then clique merging algorithm was performed to explore modules in the reweighted PPI network, and these modules were compared with each other so as to select similar modules; in the following, attractor modules were identified via attract method; finally, pathway enrichment analysis of genes in attractor modules was carried out.  Results:   A total of 11,535 genes were gained. A novel PPI network with 4698 nodes (20,541 interactions) was established via mapping the genes of the gene expression profile onto the original PPIs. Then, 1635 and 1487 interactions (P < 0.05) were selected to construct the destination network for CPA group and control group, respectively. Moreover, under the threshold value of overlap -threshold value of each two modules ≥ 0.5, 42 and 56 modules were separately determined for CPA group and control group. Twenty-six pairs of similar modules ([J (Sn, Tm)] ≥0.7) were gained. In the following, an attractor module which contained six nodes (15 interactions) (P < 0.05) was identified. Finally, two pathways with terms of DNA replication (P = 0.000137) and nucleotide excision repair (P = 0.024) were identified, and RFC4, POLE2 enriched in both of the pathways.

This study was undertaken to analyze the frequency, clinical presentation, and the histopathological spectrum of the various male urogenital tumors diagnosed over a period of 3 years in a tertiary care institute.  Materials and methods:   Three-year data were collected from the histopathology laboratory, which included all the cases of male urogenital tumors which were diagnosed histopathologically between November 2012 and October 2015.  Results:   A total of 10,297 surgical specimens of male patients were received in 3 years, of which 1749 were tumors of various organs in males. Of 1749 surgical specimens, 455 were genitourinary tumors. Frequency of urogenital tumors in males was 13.05%. Malignant tumors comprised the majority (99.53%). The age of the patients ranged from 19 to 98 years. The maximum number of patients was in the 5th-7th decade and the mean age of presentation was 64 years. Urinary bladder was the most common site for urogenital tumors (61.09%), with urothelial carcinoma being the most common histological type. Prostatic adenocarcinoma, renal cell carcinoma, and penile squamous cell carcinoma accounted for a significant number of cases. Testicular tumors were the least common and included predominantly mixed germ cell tumors.

There is a lack of consensus for the selection criteria for bone scan in low-risk patients. Western guidelines do not recommend use of bone scan in asymptomatic patients and in low prostate-specific antigen (PSA) values. We try to correlate the PSA value with bone metastases through bone scan in the Indian population.  Materials and methods:   A total of 68 histologically newly diagnosed prostate cancer subjected to bone scan were retrospectively analyzed. The patients were stratified into four groups according to their PSA level: The first group of patients had PSA level ranging from 0 to 10 ng/ml (n = 4), the second group had PSA level ranging from 10.1 to 20 ng/ml (n = 13), the third group had PSA levels 20.1-100 ng/ml (n = 23), and the fourth group has PSA >100 (n = 28).  Results:   The incidence of osseous metastases proven by bone scan was found to be zero (0 out of 4) for PSA level 0-10 ng/ml; 38.46% (5 out of 13) for PSA level 10.1-20, 60.87% (14 out of 23) for PSA level 20.1-100 ng/ml, and 100% for PSA >100 (P < 0.005) (95% confidence interval 1.01-1.1). For cut-off value of PSA ≤10 ng/ml, sensitivity and specificity were 100% and 19.05%, respectively, with positive predictive value of 73.44%.  Conclusion:   The correlation between PSA value and presence of metastases confirms the usefulness of bone scan scintigraphy in prostate cancer staging.

Recently, some of the TPSs incorporated biological-based cost function for IMRT optimization. Most of the previous studies compared IMRT plans optimized using biological-based and DV-based cost functions in two different TPSs. Hence, the purpose of the study is to compare equivalent uniform dose (EUD)-based and DV-based IMRT plans generated using the same TPS.  Materials and methods:   Twenty patients with prostate cancer were retrospectively selected for this study. For each patient, two IMRT plans were generated using EUD-based cost function (EUD_TP) and DV-based cost (DV_Treatment Plan (TP)), respectively. The generated IMRT plans were evaluated using both physical and biological dose evaluation indices.  Results:   Biological-based plans ended up with a highly inhomogeneous target dose when compared to DV-based plans. For serial organs, Dnear-max or D2%(Gy) of EUD-based plans showed significant difference with DV-based plans (P = 0.003). For both rectum and bladder, there was a significant difference in mean dose and D30%(Gy) dose between EUD-based plans and DV-based plans.

However, Pca patients have an increased risk of femoral head damages including fractures after radiotherapy. The mechanisms of these complications are unknown and time of manifestations is too long; however, they may be predicted by early imaging. The main purpose of this study was to assess the early changes in femoral heads in Pca patients treated with intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) using multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) radiomic feature analysis.  Materials and methods:   Thirty Pca patients treated with IMRT were included in the study. All patients underwent two mpMRI pre- and postradiotherapy. Thirty-four robust radiomic features were extracted from T1, T2, and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) obtained from diffusion-weighted images. Wilcoxon signed-rank test was performed to assess the significance of the change in the mean T1, T2, and ADC radiomic features postradiotherapy relative to preradiotherapy values. The percentage change values were normalized based on the natural logarithm base ten. Features were also ranked based on their median changes.  Results:   Sixty femoral heads were analyzed. All radiomic features have undergone changes. Significant postradiotherapy radiomic feature changes were observed in 20 and 5 T1- and T2-weighted radiomic features, respectively (P < 0.05). ADC features did not vary significantly postradiotherapy. The mean radiation dose received by femoral heads was 40 Gy. No fractures were observed within the follow-up time. Different features were found as high ranked among T1, T2, and ADC images.  Conclusion:   Early structural change analysis using radiomic features may contribute to predict postradiotherapy fracture in Pca patients.

In this study, we demonstrate that high-fat diets (HFDs) promoted pathological transformation mediated by the synergy of Src and androgen receptor in vivo. Additionally, a diet high in saturated fat significantly enhanced proliferation of Src-mediated xenograft tumors in comparison with a diet high in unsaturated fat. The saturated fatty acid palmitate, a major constituent in a HFD, significantly upregulated the biosynthesis of palmitoyl-CoA in cancer cells in vitro and in xenograft tumors in vivo. The exogenous palmitate enhanced Src-dependent mitochondrial β-oxidation. Additionally, it elevated the amount of C16-ceramide and total saturated ceramides, increased the level of Src kinase localized in the cell membrane, and Src-mediated downstream signaling, such as the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase and focal adhesion kinase.

Follow-up analysis found that patients who progressed to castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) have a lower frequency of ERG protein expression at initial biopsies compared to androgen deprivation therapy (ADT)-sensitive cases (14.1% vs 23.5%, P = 0.042), but Kaplan-Meier curve showed that ERG protein expression was not an independent prognostic marker. Of all the 106 ERG-positive cases, eight cases (7.5%) exhibited heterogeneous expression of ERG protein, in which ERG was only positive in tumors with Gleason pattern 3, but negative in Gleason pattern 4. The FISH analysis was consistent with IHC in six of these cases. In the other two cases, ERG rearrangement was detected in tumors with both Gleason pattern 3 and 4 by FISH, despite the negative protein expression in Gleason pattern 4. In case 1, a repeated biopsy was performed when the disease progressed to CRPC, and no ERG-positive cells were identified neither by IHC nor FISH.  Conclusion:   This was by far the largest series of ERG expression and heterogeneity analysis in Chinese PCa. The ERG rearrangement seemed to be frequently expressed in patients with relatively younger age and lower Gleason score and infrequently expressed in PCa with the IDC-P. PCa with positive ERG were less frequently to progress to CRPC, but there was no prognostic significance of ERG expression. In heterogeneous cases, ERG protein was detectable only in tumors with Gleason pattern 3 but not in pattern 4. Tumor cells with positive ERG expression/rearrangement seemed easily response to ADT.""","""['Ling Nie', 'Xiuyi Pan', 'Mengni Zhang', 'Xiaoxue Yin', 'Jing Gong', 'Xueqin Chen', 'Miao Xu', 'Qiao Zhou', 'Ni Chen']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['The prognostic and predictive value of TMPRSS2-ERG gene fusion and ERG protein expression in prostate cancer biopsies.', 'Prognostic Significance of ERG Gene Rearrangement and Protein Expression in Prostate Cancer.', 'Characterizing the molecular features of ERG-positive tumors in primary and castration resistant prostate cancer.', 'Relative 8q gain predicts disease-specific survival irrespective of the TMPRSS2-ERG fusion status in diagnostic biopsies of prostate cancer.', 'TMPRSS2:ERG Gene Fusions in Prostate Cancer of West African Men and a Meta-Analysis of Racial Differences.', 'High Homogeneity of Mesothelin Expression in Primary and Metastatic Ovarian Cancer.', 'The Role of AMACR, CD10, TMPRSS2-ERG, and p27 Protein Expression Among Different Gleason Grades of Prostatic Adenocarcinoma on Needle Biopsy.', 'Intraductal Carcinoma of the Prostate as a Cause of Prostate Cancer Metastasis: A Molecular Portrait.', 'Epidemiology and genomics of prostate cancer in Asian men.', 'Immunohistochemical expression of Cyclin D1 among Sudanese patients diagnosed with benign and malignant prostatic lesions.']"""

Methods:   To study the role of IL-1β expression in prostate inflammation, we examined IL1B expression in human prostatic proliferative inflammatory atrophy (PIA) lesions and developed a tetracycline-regulated human IL1B transgene in the mouse prostate.  Results:   Here, we demonstrate that IL1B expression is a common finding in human PIA lesions, which harbored focal IL1B expression in epithelial and stromal compartments. Human IL1B expression in the mouse prostate elicited acute and chronic inflammation. Penetrance and expressivity were variable and tunable by altering transgene dosage and the presence of an exogenous inducible marker antigen (green fluorescent protein). Inflammation was characterized by infiltration of CD4+ T cells, demonstrating an adaptive immune response. Chronic inflammation persisted after doxycycline (Dox) withdrawal. Reactive epithelia increased expression of downstream cytokines, and altered glandular architecture was observed upon sustained induction of IL1B. Immunohistochemical analyses revealed a higher proliferative index and decreased Nkx3.1 expression in inflamed mouse prostates.

On the other hand, acetyl CoA carboxylase 1 (ACC1), the rate limiting enzyme of lipogenesis is also abundantly expressed in cancer cells, to satisfy the demand for the fatty acids (FAs) needed for rapid cell proliferation. We found Pin1 expression levels to correlate positively with ACC1 levels in human prostate cancers, and we focused on the relationship between Pin1 and ACC1. Notably, it was demonstrated that Pin1 associates with ACC1 but not with acetyl CoA carboxylase 2 (ACC2) in the overexpression system as well as endogenously in the prostate cancer cell line DU145. This association is mediated by the WW domain in the Pin1 and C-terminal domains of ACC1. Interestingly, Pin1 deficiency or treatment with Pin1 siRNA or the inhibitor juglone markedly reduced ACC1 protein expression without affecting its mRNA level, while Pin1 overexpression increased the ACC1 protein level. In addition, chloroquine treatment restored the levels of ACC1 protein reduced by Pin1 siRNA treatment, indicating that Pin1 suppressed ACC1 degradation through the lysosomal pathway. In brief, we have concluded that Pin1 leads to the stabilization of and increases in ACC1.

The long non-coding RNA Prostate cancer-associated transcript-1 (PCAT-1) has been reported to play important roles in multiple human cancers. However, the role of PCAT-1 in OC has never been investigated. The purpose of this study was to investigate the expression and roles of PCAT-1 in OC.  Material and methods:   Expression of PCAT-1 and miR-129-5p in OC tissues and cell lines was determined by qRT-PCR. Cell proliferation and apoptosis were analyzed by MTT assay and flow cytometry, respectively. The interaction between PCAT-1 and miR-129-5p was demonstrated by luciferase reporter assay.  Results:   PCAT-1 is significantly upregulated in OC tissues and cell lines (p < 0.05). Overexpression of PCAT-1 promotes proliferation of OC cells and inhibits their apoptosis (p < 0.05). In addition, miR-129-5p is markedly downregulated in OC and its level is inversely correlated with PCAT-1 expression in OC tumor tissues (p < 0.05). miR-129-5p inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis in OC cell lines (p < 0.05). Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that miR-129-5p is directly targeted by PCAT-1 and miR-129-5p overexpression can effectively attenuate the effects of PCAT-1 on the proliferation and apoptosis of OC cells.

Methods:   The mRNA expression levels of miR-9-5p and StarD13 were determined in several prostate cancer cell lines. We chose DU145 and PC-3 cells for further research. The CCK8 assay was used to measure the cell viability. The cell invasion and wound-healing assays were respectively applied to evaluate invasion and migration. The expression of E-cadherin (E-cad), N-cadherin (N-cad) and vimentin were measured via western blot. DU145 and PC-3 cells overexpressing StarD13 were generated to investigate the variation in proliferation, invasion and migration. A luciferase reporter assay was used to identify the target of miR-9-5p.  Results:   Our results show that miR-9-5p was highly expressed and StarD13 was suppressed in prostate cancer cells. MiR-9-5p inhibition repressed the cells' viability, invasion and migration. It also increased the expression of E-cad and decreased that of N-cad and vimentin. StarD13 overexpression gave the same results as silencing of miR-9-5p: suppression of cell proliferation, invasion and migration. The bioinformatics analysis predicted StarD13 as a target gene of miR-9-5p. Quantitative RT-PCR, western blot analysis and the dual-luciferase reporter assay were employed to confirm the prediction.  Conclusion:   Our results show that miR-9-5p plays a powerful role in the growth, invasion, migration and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of prostate cancer cells by regulating StarD13.

However, eventually, the development of toxic side effects and resistance limits the therapeutic benefit being the major concern in the treatment of prostate cancer. Combination therapies in many cases, enhance drug efficacy and delay the appearance of undesired effects, representing an important option for the treatment of castration-resistant prostate cancer. In this study, we tested the efficacy of the combination of docetaxel and capsaicin, the pungent ingredient of hot chili peppers, on prostate cancer cells proliferation.  Methods:   Prostate cancer LNCaP and PC3 cell lines were used in this study. Levels of total and phosphorylated forms of Akt, mTOR, S6, LKB1, AMPK and ACC were determined by Western blot. AMPK, LKB1 and Akt knock down was performed by siRNA. PTEN was overexpressed by transient transfection with plasmids. Xenograft prostate tumors were induced in nude mice and treatments (docetaxel and capsaicin) were administered intraperitoneally. Statistical analyses were performed with GraphPad software. Combination index was calculated with Compusyn software.  Results:   Docetaxel and capsaicin synergistically inhibited the growth of LNCaP and PC3 cells, with a combination index lower than 1 for most of the combinations tested. Co-treatment with docetaxel and capsaicin notably decreased Akt and its downstream targets mTOR and S6 phosphorylation. Overexpression of PTEN phosphatase abrogated the synergistic antiproliferative effect of docetaxel and capsaicin. The combined treatment also increased the phosphorylation of AMP-activated kinase (AMPK) and the phosphorylation of its substrate ACC. In addition, pharmacological inhibition of AMPK with dorsomorphin (compound C) as well as knock down by siRNA of AMPK or its upstream kinase LKB1, abolished the synergy of docetaxel and capsaicin. Mechanistically, we showed that the synergistic anti-proliferative effect may be attributed to two independent effects: Inhibition of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway by one side, and AMPK activation by the other. In vivo experiments confirmed the synergistic effects of docetaxel and capsaicin in reducing the tumor growth of PC3 cells.

Prostate cancer is indeed the second most common cancer in men. Surgical technics have evolved from open surgery to robot-assisted surgery with a reduction of postoperative complications. Such technical improvements associated with modern anesthesia allow outpatient surgery in various types of procedures.  Material and methods:   After approval of the IRB, this observational prospective and monocentric study was performed in the urology unit at Rennes University Hospital between December 2015 and October 2017. All patients scheduled for RARP performed by one experienced surgeon were consecutively included. The possibility of discharge was evaluated using the Post Anesthesia Discharge Scoring System (PADSS) score until patients had a score of 9 or higher allowing their discharge. Risk factors of delayed discharge were secondarily assessed RESULTS: Ninety-seven patients scheduled for RARP performed by one experienced surgeon were consecutively included. Only 1 patient had a PADSS score ≥ 9 the day of the surgery (day 0). Seventy-four percent of the patients achieved discharge criteria 1 day after surgery whereas, 33% and 66% of the population was effectively discharged on day 2 and day 3, respectively. Patients with a PADSS score ≥ 9 at day 1 experienced significantly less postoperative nausea and vomiting than patients with a PADSS score ≥ 9 at day 2 or 3 (7% vs 28%, P = .01).  Conclusion:   Outpatient RARP was not feasible in most patients. However, routine discharge at day 1 seems conceivable.

Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) is the marker for prostate cancer puncture screening. The aim of our study was to investigate the association between MetS and its components with PSA levels. Data were obtained from 482 943 healthy men who underwent routine health check-ups from January 2010 to December 2017. We used linear regression analysis to evaluate the effects of MetS and its components on PSA levels. To explore the cumulative effect of MetS components, analysis of variance trend analysis was carried out. The PSA levels in the group with MetS were significantly lower than those without MetS (P = 0.001). In the multivariate regression model, age (P < 0.001) and hypertension (P < 0.001) were correlated positively with PSA levels; nevertheless, obesity (P < 0.001), hypertriglyceridemia (P < 0.001), hyperglycemia (P < 0.001), and low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level (P < 0.001) had a negative correlation. In addition, after adjustment for age, increasing sums of positive MetS components were associated with a linear decrease in PSA levels (P<0.001). In conclusion, MetS, obesity, hypertriglyceridemia, hyperglycemia, and low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels are associated with decreased PSA levels. For patients with PSA levels at the critical value of prostate puncture, the effect of these diseases in reducing PSA levels should be taken into account.""","""['Xiaoshuai Gao', 'Ting Bao', 'Hanwei Yang', 'Yali Lei', 'Xianwen Jiang', 'Yan Huang', 'Wenxia Huang', 'Huairong Tang']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Eur J Cancer Prev""","""['Reply to: Comment to: The association of metabolic syndrome and its components with serum prostate-specific antigen levels.', 'Actual lowering effect of metabolic syndrome on serum prostate-specific antigen levels is partly concealed by enlarged prostate: results from a large-scale population-based study.', 'Metabolic syndrome-like components and prostate cancer risk: results from the Reduction by Dutasteride of Prostate Cancer Events (REDUCE) study.', 'Metabolic syndrome and low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol are associated with adverse pathological features in patients with prostate cancer treated by radical prostatectomy.', 'Prostate kallikrein markers in diagnosis, risk stratification and prognosis.', 'Association between components of metabolic syndrome and periodontitis: a systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Association of TyG index with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) in American men: results from NHANES, 2003-2010.', 'Clinical factors affecting prostate-specific antigen levels in prostate cancer patients undergoing radical prostatectomy: a retrospective study.']"""

Methods:   We retrospectively investigated a total of 17 patients with mp-MRI and CT images acquired pre-treatment and treated by HDR prostate brachytherapy. 21 dominant intraprostatic lesions (DILs) were contoured on mp-MRI and propagated to CT images using a deformable image registration method. A boost plan was created for each patient and optimized on the original needle pattern. In addition, separate plans were generated using a virtually implanted needle around the DIL to mimic mp-MRI guided needle placement. DIL dose coverage and organ-at-rick (OAR) sparing were compared with original plan results. Tumor control probability (TCP) was estimated to further evaluate the clinical impact on the boost plans.  Results:   Overall, optimized boost plans significantly escalated dose to DILs while meeting OAR constraints. The addition of mp-MRI guided virtual needles facilitate increased coverage of DIL volumes, achieving a V150 > 90% in 85 % of DILs compared with 57 % of boost plan without an additional needle. Compared with original plan, TCP models estimated improvement in DIL control by 28 % for patients with external-beam treatment and by 8 % for monotherapy patients.  Conclusion:   With MR/CT registration, the proposed mp-MRI guided DIL boost in CT-based HDR brachytherapy is feasible without violating OAR constraints, and indicates significant clinical benefit in improving TCP of DIL. It may represent a strategy to personalize treatment delivery and improve tumor control.

Methods and materials:   Nineteen patients received concurrent SBRT to the prostate and PLNs on a phase II clinical trial. The translational and rotation shifts required for rigid registration to bony anatomy and changes in bladder and rectal anatomy were compared between patients with > 90% and < 90% coverage of the nodal clinical target volume (CTVN ) as drawn on fractional kilovoltage cone-beam CTs. Stepwise multivariable regression models evaluated relationships between these anatomical parameters and the change in V100%CTVN.  Results:   The average V100%CTVN per patient was 92.4 % (IQR, 90.2 - 96.4 %). For five patients (26.3%), the average was 85.0 % (IQR, 82.4-88.3 %). The left-right and superior-inferior translational shifts, sagittal rotational shift, and change in bladder volume were significantly different ( p < 0.05 for all via Student's t-test).

Conclusion:   While simultaneous SBRT to the prostate and PLNs based on rigid registration to IPMs provides adequate PLN coverage in most instances, overall coverage may be lower than anticipated if anatomy is unstable. Careful evaluation of bladder filling on kV-CBCT before treatment may be the most practical method for estimating accuracy prior to treatment.

The objective of this substudy was to evaluate intrafraction motion using cine MRI and assess the dosimetric impact of using a rectal displacement device (RDD).  Methods:   The initial 10 patients recruited underwent planning CT and MRI, with and without a RDD. Cine MRI images were captured using an interleaved T2 HASTE sequence in sagittal and axial planes with a temporal resolution of 5.2 s acquired over 4.3 min. Points of interest (POIs) were defined and a validated tracking algorithm measured displacement of these points over the 4.3 min in the anteroposterior, superior-inferior and left-right directions. Plans were generated with and without a RDD to examine the impact on dosimetry.  Results:   There was an overall trend for increasing displacement in all directions as time progressed when no RDD was in situ . points of interest remained comparatively stable with the RDD. In the sagittal plane, the RDD resulted in statistically significant improvement in the range of anteroposterior displacement for the rectal wall, anterior prostate, prostate apex and base. Dosimetrically, the use of a RDD significantly reduced rectal V16, V14 and Dmax, as well as the percentage of posterior rectal wall receiving 8.5 Gy.  Conclusion:   The RDD used in stereotactic prostate radiotherapy leads to reduced intrafraction motion of the prostate and rectum, with increasing improvement with time.

Methods: Total 121 cases of biopsy proven prostatic acinar adenocarcinoma were selected from records of pathology department archives from January 2013 till December 2017. Hematoxylin and eosin stained slides and paraffin blocks were retrieved and new sections were cut where necessary. Slides of all cases were reviewed by two senior histopathologists and pathologic characteristics like Gleason score, WHO grade, tumor quantification, perineural and lymphovascular invasion were evaluated. Androgen receptor immunohistochemistry was applied on all cases. Results: Low AR expression was noted in 53 cases (43.8%) while high AR expression was seen in 68 cases (56.2%). Significant association of AR expression was noted with total Gleason score, WHO grade and percentage of tissue involvement (tumor quantification). Univariate binary logistic regression showed patients with low Gleason scores (scores 6,7 or 8) and low WHO grade (grade 1, 2 or 3) were less likely to express high AR expression in comparison to high Gleason score (score 9) and high WHO grade group (grade 5) respectively. Similarly, cases with low tissue involvement by carcinoma (<50%) were less likely to show high AR expression in comparison to cases with >50% tissue involvement by carcinoma. Conclusion: Significant association of AR expression was noted with total Gleason score, WHO grade and percentage of tissue involvement (tumor quantification) which are among the most important markers of tumor progression; therefore we suggest that AR expression should be performed in patients with prostatic adenocarcinoma for prognostic stratification of the patients.""","""['Atif Ali Hashmi', 'Ghazala Mudassir', 'Muhammad Irfan', 'Zubaida Fida Hussain', 'Shumaila Kanwal Hashmi', 'Huda Asif', 'Laila Nisar', 'Maheen Naeem', 'Naveen Faridi']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Asian Pac J Cancer Prev""","""['ERG oncoprotein expression in prostatic acinar adenocarcinoma; clinicopathologic significance.', 'Aberrant expression of CARM1, a transcriptional coactivator of androgen receptor, in the development of prostate carcinoma and androgen-independent status.', 'Role of androgen receptor in prostatic neoplasia versus hyperplasia.', 'Contemporary Gleason Grading of Prostatic Carcinoma: An Update With Discussion on Practical Issues to Implement the 2014 International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) Consensus Conference on Gleason Grading of Prostatic Carcinoma.', 'The prognostic role of ERG immunopositivity in prostatic acinar adenocarcinoma: a study including 454 cases and review of the literature.']"""

This hostile microenvironment imposes strong selective pressures on tumor cells, leading eventually to the survival and expansion of aggressive subclones that condition further tumor evolution. To model features of this microenvironment in vitro, a diffusional barrier can be introduced in the form of a coverslip placed on top of cells, a method termed coverslip hypoxia. Using a variant of this method, with larger volume between coverslip and cells and with oxygen diffusion occurring only through a small hole in the center of the coverslip, we have visualized alterations in LNCaP tumor cells as a function of their distance to the oxygen source at the center. We observed remarkable morphological changes in LNCaP cells as the distance from the center increases, with cells becoming highly spread, displaying dynamic membrane protrusions and occasionally adopting a migratory phenotype. Concomitantly, cells farther from the center displayed marked increases in the hypoxia marker hypoxyprobe, whereas extracellular pH decreased in the same direction. Cells with altered morphology displayed prominent increases in fibrillar actin, as well as swollen mitochondria with distorted cristae and accumulation of neutral lipid-containing intracellular vesicles. These results show that an in vitro microenvironment that models diffusional barriers encountered by tumors in situ can have profound effects on tumor cells. The coverslip hypoxia variant we describe can be used to characterize in vitro the response of tumor cells to environmental conditions that play crucial roles in early tumor development.""","""['Miguel Arocena', 'Mercedes Landeira', 'Andrés Di Paolo', 'Alejandro Silva', 'José Sotelo-Silveira', 'Ariel Fernández', 'Julia Alonso']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""J Cell Physiol""","""['Hypoxia, acidification and oxidative stress in cells cultured at large distances from an oxygen source.', 'Coverslip hypoxia: a novel method for studying cardiac myocyte hypoxia and ischemia in vitro.', 'Imaging of oxygen gradients in monolayer cultured cells using green fluorescent protein.', 'Metabolic microenvironment of tumor cells: a key factor in malignant progression.', 'A role for hypoxia and hypoxia-inducible transcription factors in tumor physiology.', 'Hypoxia, acidification and oxidative stress in cells cultured at large distances from an oxygen source.', 'Computational multifocus fluorescence microscopy for three-dimensional visualization of multicellular tumor spheroids.']"""

The present study reported that the novel lncRNA small nucleolar RNA host gene 6 (SNHG6) is overexpressed in PCa compared with that in normal prostate tissues. In The Cancer Genome Atlas and Taylor datasets, high expression of SNHG6 in PCa tissues was identified to be significantly associated with shorter disease-free survival. In order to reveal the potential mechanisms of the role of SNHG6 in PCa, SNHG6-associated protein-protein interaction networks were constructed. Bioinformatics analysis revealed that these SNHG6-interacting genes were associated with translation, nuclear-transcribed mRNA catabolic process, ribosomal RNA processing and mRNA splicing.

While AdPC and t-NEPC share similar genomes, they possess distinct transcriptomes, suggesting that RNA splicing and epigenetic mechanisms may regulate t-NEPC development.  Objective:   To characterize the role of alternative RNA splicing of the histone demethylase BHC80 during t-NEPC progression.  Design, setting, and participants:   The expression of BHC80 splice variants (BHC80-1 and BHC80-2) were compared between AdPC and t-NEPC patient tumors. Regulatory mechanisms of RNA splicing of the BHC80 gene were studied, and the signal pathways mediated by BHC80 splice variants were investigated in t-NEPC cell and xenograft models.  Results:   Global transcriptome analyses identified that the BHC80-2 variant is highly expressed in t-NEPC. Compared with the known histone demethylation activities of the BHC80 gene, we discovered a novel nonepigenetic action of BHC80-2, whereby BHC80-2 is localized in the cytoplasm to trigger the MyD88-p38-TTP pathway, which results in increased RNA stability of multiple tumor-promoting cytokines. While BHC80-2 does not induce neuroendocrine differentiation of cancer cells, it stimulates cell proliferation and tumor progression independent of androgen receptor signaling. Blockade of BHC80-2-regulated MyD88 signaling suppresses growth of several t-NEPC cell spheroid and xenograft models.  Conclusions:   Gain of function of BHC80-2 through alternative RNA splicing activates immune responses of cancer cells to promote t-NEPC development.  Patient summary:   The main obstacle to develop effective therapies for patients with t-NEPC is the lack of understanding on how t-NEPC is developed. Our study not only identifies a previously unknown BHC80-2-MyD88 signaling pathway that plays an important role during t-NEPC development, but also provides a proof of principle that targeting this signal pathway may offer an avenue to treat t-NEPC.""","""['Yinan Li', 'Ning Xie', 'Ruiqi Chen', 'Ahn R Lee', 'Jessica Lovnicki', 'Emma A Morrison', 'Ladan Fazli', 'Qingfu Zhang', 'Catherine A Musselman', 'Yuzhuo Wang', 'Jiaoti Huang', 'Martin E Gleave', 'Colin Collins', 'Xuesen Dong']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Eur Urol""","""['The Role of Splicing Regulators in the Emergence of Treatment-induced Neuroendocrine Prostate Cancer: The Next Generation of Drug Targets?', 'SRRM4 Drives Neuroendocrine Transdifferentiation of Prostate Adenocarcinoma Under Androgen Receptor Pathway Inhibition.', 'Alternative RNA splicing of the MEAF6 gene facilitates neuroendocrine prostate cancer progression.', 'Alternative RNA splicing of the GIT1 gene is associated with neuroendocrine prostate cancer.', 'Molecular events in neuroendocrine prostate cancer development.', 'The role of epigenetics and long noncoding RNA MIAT in neuroendocrine prostate cancer.', 'Discovery of Novel Lin28 Inhibitors to Suppress Cancer Cell Stemness.', 'Specific classification and new therapeutic targets for neuroendocrine prostate cancer: A patient-based, diagnostic study.', 'Anti-Androgen Receptor Therapies in Prostate Cancer: A Brief Update and Perspective.', 'Alternative Splicing, Epigenetic Modifications and Cancer: A Dangerous Triangle, or a Hopeful One?', 'Screening Gene Expression-Related Alternative Splicing Event Signature for Colon Cancer Prognostic Prediction.']"""

PBCR data is useful in the planning and implementation of cancer prevention and control strategies. Ghana's plan for control of non-communicable diseases recognises the need for good quality data to facilitate the attainment of set goals.  Methods:   We reviewed data from the Kumasi Cancer Registry for the year 2015. Data collected included clinical and demographic information, laboratory reports and source of case information. Data was entered into the Canreg-5 software. Data was initially analysed using Canreg-5 to estimate the incidence and age standardised rates (ASR) for various tumours. Data was also exported to Microsoft Excel for further analysis using Epi Info version 7.1.4. Microsoft Excel was used to generate charts and graphs. Aggregated data for the years 2013 and 2014 were also analysed for trends in cancer incidence and ASR.  Results:   A total of 736 cancer cases were recorded among the residents of Kumasi for the year 2015. Females accounted for 62.4% of all cases. The overall incidence of cancer in Kumasi for 2015 was 46.1 per 100,000. The mean age of all cases was 51.3 years (with a range of 1 to 99 years). The incidence among female residents was estimated at 54.1 per 100,000 compared with 37.1 per 100,000 in males. Among females, breast and cervical cancers recorded the highest incidences of 16.1 per 100,000 and 13.7 per 100,000 respectively. Among males, prostate cancer had the highest incidence of 10.5 per 100,000. Breast, cervical and liver cancers were the commonest in both sexes accounting for 19.7, 14.7 and 11.4% of cases respectively.  Conclusion:   There has been significant improvement in data quality and coverage since the inception of our PBCR in 2012. PBCRs are feasible; therefore there is the need for more such registries to improve data on cancers in Ghana. Consistent with other evidence, we found breast cancer as the commonest female cancer in Ghana.""","""['Yaw Ampem Amoako', 'Baffour Awuah', 'Rita Larsen-Reindorf', 'Fred Kwame Awittor', 'Gloria Kyem', 'Kwame Ofori-Boadu', 'Ernest Osei-Bonsu', 'Dennis Odai Laryea']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""BMC Cancer""","""['Cancer incidence in Ghana, 2012: evidence from a population-based cancer registry.', 'Italian cancer figures--Report 2015: The burden of rare cancers in Italy.', 'Establishing effective registration systems in resource-limited settings: cancer registration in Kumasi, Ghana.', 'Establishing a Cancer Registry in a Resource-Constrained Region: Process Experience From Ghana.', 'Childhood cancer incidence in India: a review of population-based cancer registries.', 'Household treatment cost of breast cancer and cost coping strategies from a tertiary facility in Ghana.', 'Breast cancer screening pathways in Ghana: applying an exploratory single case study methodology with cross-case analysis.', ""Ghana's preparedness to exploit the medicinal value of industrial hemp."", 'Describing and Modeling the Burden of Hospitalization of Patients With Neoplasms in Ghana Using Routine Health Data for 2012-2017.', 'Optimization of a protocol for the evaluation of antibody responses to human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination in low-resource settings.']"""

Here we investigate whether Gleason pattern 5 is a predictor for biochemical recurrence. Methods: This retrospective study included 168 patients who underwent laparoscopic radical prostatectomy from 2006 to 2015. The relationship between biochemical recurrence after laparoscopic radical prostatectomy and the presence of Gleason pattern 5, even as a tertiary pattern, was investigated. Biochemical recurrence was defined when the prostate-specific antigen level rose to >0.2 ng/ml after having decreased to <0.1 ng/ml following laparoscopic radical prostatectomy. Biochemical recurrence-free survival was estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method. Multivariate analysis was performed using a Cox proportional hazards regression model. Results: The median age was 66 years, median initial prostate-specific antigen level was 6.9 ng/ml, and median follow-up period was 47.3 months. Biochemical recurrence was recognized in 27 patients (16.1%) after laparoscopic radical prostatectomy, and 5-year biochemical recurrence-free survival was 78.6%. Gleason pattern 5 was noted in 5 patients as the primary pattern, in 10 as the secondary pattern, and in 5 as the tertiary pattern. According to multivariate analysis, presence of Gleason pattern 5 (HR = 4.75, p=0.001) and positive surgical margin (HR = 4.66, p=0.001) were independent predictive factors for biochemical recurrence-free survival.

Adequate tissue representation is crucial for the clinical utility of multigene panel sequencing of core needle biopsies. The aim of this study was to evaluate the genomic heterogeneity in multifocal prostate cancer and to analyze how representative preoperative biopsies are of spatially separated tumor foci.  Methods:   We analyzed at least 2 tumor foci and 1 to 3 preoperative biopsy cores from 11 patients. Diagnostic biopsies, as well as fresh frozen and formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded samples, from major tumor foci of radical prostatectomy specimens were macrodissected for the enrichment of tumor tissue. DNA was extracted and sequenced. We analyzed structural alterations, mutations, and copy number variations and compared the genomic profiles of tumor foci with those of preoperative biopsies.  Results:   Alterations were rarely shared between foci, indicating a high degree of genomic heterogeneity. In 8 of 11 men at least 1 tumor focus was represented by the biopsies defined as harboring at least 1 common clonal somatic event. In only one case, somatic alterations from two spatially separate tumors were identified in the biopsies. Of the mutations and structural variants detected in fresh frozen or formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded prostatectomy material, only an average of 19% (range 0-44) and 55% (range 0-100), respectively, were found in preoperative biopsies where a common somatic origin was established.  Conclusions:   Multifocal prostate cancer is a somatically heterogeneous disease in which systematic needle biopsies do not provide sufficient molecular representation of the somatic alterations detected in spatially distinct tumor areas.

Many cases of advanced prostate cancer have evidence of bone metastasis. Accurate EOBD quantification could help predict the response to radium-223-dichloride therapy. Current EOBD score is simple to use but does not consider size, intensity or localisation of lesion BSI might be more suitable for stratification of bone metastases.  Patients and methods:   Bone scans (n=20) preceding radium-223-dichloride treatment for prostate cancer were assessed retrospectively using automated BSI software (EXINI) and by assessing maximum counts per lesion. Results were then compared to total alkaline phosphatase (ALP) as a measure of biochemical response to therapy using linear regressions and to their EOBD scores using box plot analysis.  Results:   Moderate correlation was found between ALP response and maximum lesion intensity (R=0.41) and BSI (R=0.46). Strong correlation (R=0.71) was found between baseline ALP and BSI and between lesion number and BSI (R=0.60).

However, few studies have examined its therapeutic potential in prostate cancer (PC), a most common and highly aggressive malignancy among male population. We used both LNCaP, and PC3 and PC3-AR (androgen receptor) cells as the model system and assessed the effects of nimotuzumab on epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in vitro and in vivo. The EMT makers were detected by immunohistochemistry, qRT-PCR and Western blot. MTT, wound healing assay, and transwell assay were used to measure cell viability, migration, and invasion, respectively. For mechanistic understanding, we evaluated the significance of Akt/Y-box binding protein-1 (YB-1)/AR axis in nimotuzumab-induced EMT by overexpressing AR, activating Akt using SC79, and/or downregulating YB-1 using siRNA. Nimotuzumab suppressed the xenograft growth from both LNCaP and PC3 cells in vivo, which was associated with reduced EMT. Consistently, nimotuzumab inhibited proliferation, cell-cycle progression, EMT, and migration/invasion, but stimulated apoptosis of both LNCaP and PC3-AR cells in vitro. On the molecular level, nimotuzumab inactivated Akt and YB-1 and reduced the expression of AR. Boosting AR expression in LNCaP and PC3-AR cells antagonized the action of nimotuzumab, at least partially restored EMT, and enhanced the migration/invasion. We also found that Akt was essential for controlling YB-1 activation, and both critical for regulating the levels of AR and EMT-related biomarkers. In this study, we presented our novel findings that by targeting the Akt/YB-1/AR axis, nimotuzumab significantly inhibited EMT of PC cells. Considering that EMT is a critical mechanism contributing to the metastatic spread of cancer cells, nimotuzumab may become a promising therapy for alleviating the malignant progression of PC. © 2019 IUBMB Life, 1-14, 2019.""","""['Sheng Hu', 'Yi-Xing Duan', 'Qiang Zhou', 'Yong Wang', 'Qiang Lu']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""IUBMB Life""","""['YB-1 expression promotes epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in prostate cancer that is inhibited by a small molecule fisetin.', 'Y-box binding protein 1 (YB-1) promotes gefitinib resistance in lung adenocarcinoma cells by activating AKT signaling and epithelial-mesenchymal transition through targeting major vault protein (MVP).', 'Androgen receptor as a regulator of ZEB2 expression and its implications in epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in prostate cancer.', 'Androgens as therapy for androgen receptor-positive castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Clonal Evolution and Epithelial Plasticity in the Emergence of AR-Independent Prostate Carcinoma.', 'Telmisartan anti-cancer activities mechanism through targeting N-cadherin by mimicking ADH-1 function.', 'The roles of Y-box-binding protein (YB)-1 and C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 14 (CXCL14) in the progression of prostate cancer via extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling.', 'Gene amplification of YB-1 in castration-resistant prostate cancer in association with aberrant androgen receptor expression.']"""

Novel non-invasive methods are still required for differentiation of non-aggressive from aggressive tumors. Recently, changes in prostate-specific antigen glycosylation pattern, such as core-fucosylation, have been described in prostate cancer. The objective of this study was to evaluate whether the core-fucosylation determinant of serum prostate-specific antigen may serve as refined marker for differentiation between benign prostate hyperplasia and prostate cancer or identification of aggressive prostate cancer. A previously developed liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry-based strategy was used for multiplex analysis of core-fucosylated prostate-specific antigen (fuc-PSA) and total prostate-specific antigen levels in sera from 50 benign prostate hyperplasia and 100 prostate cancer patients of different aggressiveness (Gleason scores, 5-10) covering the critical gray area (2-10 ng/mL). For identification of aggressive prostate cancer, the ratio of fuc-PSA to total prostate-specific antigen (%-fuc-PSA) yielded a 5%-8% increase in the area under the curve (0.60) compared to the currently used total prostate-specific antigen (area under the curve = 0.52) and %-free prostate-specific antigen (area under the curve = 0.55) tests. However, our data showed that aggressive prostate cancer (Gleason score > 6) and non-aggressive prostate cancer (Gleason score ≤ 6) could not significantly (p-value = 0.08) be differentiated by usage of %-fuc-PSA. In addition, both non-standardized fuc-PSA and standardized %-fuc-PSA had no diagnostic value for differentiation of benign prostate hyperplasia from prostate cancer. The %-fuc-PSA serum levels could not improve the differentiation of non-aggressive and aggressive prostate cancer compared to conventional diagnostic prostate cancer markers. Still, it is unclear whether these limitations come from the biomarker, the used patient cohort, or the imprecision of the applied method itself. Therefore, %-fuc-PSA should be further investigated, especially by more precise methods whether it could be clinically used in prostate cancer diagnosis.""","""['Robert Lang', 'Vinzent Rolny', 'Andreas Leinenbach', 'Johann Karl', 'Magdalena Swiatek-de Lange', 'Uwe Kobold', 'Mark Schrader', 'Hans Krause', 'Markus Mueller', 'Michael Vogeser']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Tumour Biol""","""['Decreased fucosylated PSA as a urinary marker for high Gleason score prostate cancer.', 'High serum dihydrotestosterone examined by ultrasensitive LC-MS/MS as a predictor of benign prostatic hyperplasia or Gleason score 6 cancer in men with prostate-specific antigen levels of 3-10\xa0ng/mL.', 'An endoglycosidase-assisted LC-MS/MS-based strategy for the analysis of site-specific core-fucosylation of low-concentrated glycoproteins in human serum using prostate-specific antigen (PSA) as example.', 'Tumor markers.

Some tRFs and tiRNAs promote cell proliferation and cell cycle progression by regulating the expression of oncogenes. Other tRFs and tiRNAs inhibit cancer progression. Mechanism studies have shown that tRFs and tiRNAs may bind to RNA binding proteins such as Y-box binding protein 1 (YBX1) and prevent transcription, inactivate initiation factor eIF4G/A, promote translation of ribosomal proteins, or activate aurora kinase A, the regulator of mitosis. Therefore, tRFs and tiRNAs regulate the occurrence and development of cancers, including lung cancer, colorectal cancer, prostate cancer, breast cancer, ovarian cancer, B cell lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, etc. This article reviews the classification of tRFs and tiRNAs, their biological functions in the occurrence of cancers, and their relationships with some common cancers.

Objective:   To test the impact of implementing the intraoperative frozen section technique (IFST) during NVBP on the frequency of NVB procedures and its effect on positive surgical margins (PSMs).  Design, setting, and participants:   We relied on an institutional tertiary-care center database to identify patients who underwent RP (January 2014-October 2018). Until October 2017, decision for NVBP was taken based on preoperative magnetic resonance imaging, clinical characteristics, and nomograms, without the IFST. After November 2017, all patients received bilateral NVBP with the IFST, to check for a PSM in the area of the NVB. If a PSM occurred, a secondary resection of the respective NVB was performed.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   PSM and NVB procedures were assessed. Subgroup analyses focused on pathologic tumor stages.  Results and limitations:   Overall, 346 patients were identified. Of these patients, 54.9% (n=190) versus 45.1% (n=156) underwent RP without versus with the IFST. By using the IFST during NVBP, the PSM decreased from 29.5% to 15.4% (p=0.003) in the entire cohort (14.6% vs 8.6% in pT2; 47.1% vs 29.4% in pT3). Conversely, NVBP increased from 55.3% to 95.5% (p<0.001) in the entire cohort (68.9% vs 99.0% in pT2; 39.1% vs 88.2% in pT3). In multivariable logistic regressions, IFST use was an independent predictor of PSMs (odds ratio [OR]: 0.54, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.30-0.98; p=0.047) and NVBP (OR: 5.60, 95% CI: 3.10-10.51; p<0.001) after controlling for patient and tumor characteristics.  Conclusions:   Implementation of the IFST during NVBP resulted in more frequent NVBP and was associated with a lower PSM, compared with RP without the IFST. Therefore, the IFST should be performed, if available.

Most of PSA in blood circulation is protein-bound, and only a small fraction is present as free PSA. In general, the serum total PSA levels are <4ng/mL in healthy controls and significantly increased in certain prostate cancer patients. Currently, <0.25 in the ratio of free PSA to total PSA (F/T value) is used as an indicator of prostate cancer. The mRNA of PSA is mainly expressed in prostate, and its protein product is a protease present in seminal plasma for the liquefaction of seminal coagulum in normal physiology. The F/T value as a prostate cancer biomarker has been questioned for its benefit over harm caused by its high false-positive rate of diagnosis. Furthermore, the molecular basis of how PSA is getting into blood circulation from seminal plasma is largely unknown. In current study, a total of 24,692 clinical lab test results of serum F/T values from healthy controls and patients with 34 different types of diseases including different types of cancers and nonneoplasm illnesses during the past 5 years were collected and analyzed statistically. Our data showed that even though the prostate cancer patients had the lowest median serum F/T values, both significantly increased and decreased serum F/T values were associated with different types of human diseases, such as acute cerebral infarction, coronary heart disease, uremia, and nephrotic syndrome.

Materials and methods: We collected data from the Cancer Registry of Norway on all patients with PC as first cancer diagnosis, from 1997 to 2014. Standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) for SC were calculated by comparing our cohort to the standard male population. Subdistribution hazard ratios were estimated in treatment groups, using patients treated with radical prostatectomy (RP) as reference. Results: We analyzed 24,592 radically treated PC patients. The median follow-up was 7.75 and 6.25 years in the external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) and RP-groups, respectively. SIR for SC was indifferent from the reference population in 24,592 radically treated patients, higher following EBRT, SIR 1.12 (1.07-1.17), and lower following RP, SIR 0.93 (0.87-0.99). EBRT treated patients had higher rectal and urinary bladder cancer incidences, SIR 1.38 (1.16-1.64) and 1.49 (1.31-1.69), respectively. The EBRT patients and the patients treated with radiation after RP (RT after RP) had 38 and 27% higher risk of any SC. We found higher risk of bladder cancer for all treatment groups as compared to RP patients. Only EBRT treated patients showed higher risk of rectal and lung cancer. Discussion/conclusions: In our study, we found that PC patients treated with EBRT had an increased incidence of SC compared to the general population. Patients treated with EBRT and RT after RP were found to have increased risk of SCs, using RP patients as reference. The risks of rectal and urinary bladder cancer in patients receiving EBRT were higher compared to both the general population and to patients treated with radical prostatectomy. The risk of SC should be taken into account when discussing treatment for patients and designing follow-up.""","""['Bjørg Y Aksnessæther', 'Jo-Åsmund Lund', 'Tor Åge Myklebust', 'Olbjørn H Klepp', 'Eva Skovlund', 'Solveig Roth Hoff', 'Arne Solberg']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Acta Oncol""","""['External Beam Radiotherapy Increases the Risk of Bladder Cancer When Compared with Radical Prostatectomy in Patients Affected by Prostate Cancer: A Population-based Analysis.', 'Incidence of second malignancies in prostate cancer patients treated with low-dose-rate brachytherapy and radical prostatectomy.', 'Secondary cancers after intensity-modulated radiotherapy, brachytherapy and radical prostatectomy for the treatment of prostate cancer: incidence and cause-specific survival outcomes according to the initial treatment intervention.', 'Localized intermediate- to high-risk prostate cancer.', 'Secondary Cancers After Radiation Therapy for Primary Prostate or Rectal Cancer.', 'Cellular Damage in the Target and Out-Of-Field Peripheral Organs during VMAT SBRT Prostate Radiotherapy: An In Vitro Phantom-Based Study.', 'Impact of Advanced Radiotherapy on Second Primary Cancer Risk in Prostate Cancer Survivors: A Nationwide Cohort Study.', 'All-Cause Mortality Risk in National Prostate Cancer Cohort: An Impact of Population-Based Prostate Cancer Screening.', 'Racial differences in the risk of second primary bladder cancer following radiation therapy among localized prostate cancer patients.', ""A scoping review of core outcome sets and their 'mapping' onto real-world data using prostate cancer as a case study.""]"""

However, the collaborative regulatory mechanisms of androgen and Notch signaling during prostate development, growth, and regeneration are largely unknown. Hairy and Enhancer of Split 1 (Hes1) is a transcriptional regulator of Notch signaling pathways, and its expression is responsive to Notch signaling. Hes1-expressing cells have been shown to possess the regenerative capability to repopulate a variety of adult tissues. In this study, we developed new mouse models to directly assess the role of the androgen receptor in prostatic Hes1-expressing cells. Selective deletion of AR expression in embryonic Hes1-expressing cells impeded early prostate development both in vivo and in tissue xenograft experiments. Prepubescent deletion of AR expression in Hes1-expressing cells resulted in prostate glands containing abnormalities in cell morphology and gland architecture. A population of castration-resistant Hes1-expressing cells was revealed in the adult prostate, with the ability to repopulate prostate epithelium following androgen supplementation. Deletion of AR in Hes1-expressing cells diminishes their regenerative ability.

Dosimetrists, radiation oncologists or medical physicists sometimes are required to visually assess the dosimetric impact of body contour changes and make a judgment call on whether further re-assessment of the plan is needed. However, an intuitive judgment cannot always be made in a timely manner due to the complexity of VMAT plans as well as the complicated forms of body contour changes. This study evaluated the dosimetric effect of body contour changes for prostate and H&N patients to help with clinical decision-making. By analyzing the one-dimensional spatial dose profiles from the original body and the body with different body contour deformations, rules of thumb for dose percentage change and isodose line shift due to body contour changes were ascertained. Moreover, based on dose distribution comparison using three-dimensional gamma analysis, the response of the clinical prostate and H&N VMAT plans to body contour changes was assessed. Within center specific dose deviation tolerances, prostate patients who had less than 2 cm single side body contour change or less than 1 cm uniform body contour change were unlikely to need plan re-assessment; H&N VMAT plans with less than 1 cm uniform body contour change or less than 1 cm shoulder superior-inferior positional change were also unlikely to trigger further evaluation. Dose percentage change and isodose line shift were considered independently from the problem of volume changes in this study, but clinically, both aspects must be considered.""","""['Lingyue Sun', 'Charles Kirkby', 'Wendy Smith']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""J Appl Clin Med Phys""","""['Defining the Optimal Time of Adaptive Replanning in Prostate Cancer Patients with Weight Change during Volumetric Arc Radiotherapy: A Dosimetric and Mathematical Analysis Using the Gamma Index.', 'Analysis of direct clinical consequences of MLC positional errors in volumetric-modulated arc therapy using 3D dosimetry system.', 'The effect of body contouring on the dose distribution delivered with volumetric-modulated arc therapy technique.', 'Texture analysis on the fluence map to evaluate the degree of modulation for volumetric modulated arc therapy.', 'Roles of Deformable Image Registration in adaptive RT: From contour propagation to dose monitoring.', 'The application of gradient dose segmented analysis of in-vivo EPID images for patients undergoing VMAT in a resource-constrained environment.', 'Novel methodology to quantify dehydration in head and neck cancer radiotherapy using DIXON MRI.', 'Dosimetric comparison of library of plans and online MRI-guided radiotherapy of cervical cancer in the presence of intrafraction anatomical changes.']"""

Patients and methods:   We identified 10 790 consecutive treated patients within our prospective database (2008-2016) who underwent either ORP (7007 patients) or RARP (3783). All procedures were performed by seven highly trained surgeons performing both surgical approaches regularly. Oncological (48-month biochemical recurrence [BCR] rate), functional (urinary continence, erectile function), and surgical outcomes (rate of nerve-sparing [NS] procedures, lymph node yield, surgical margin [SM] status, length of hospital stay [LOS], operation time, blood loss, transfusion rate, time to catheter removal) were assessed. Kaplan-Meier, multivariable Cox and logistic regression models were used to test for BCR and functional outcome differences.  Results:   No statistically significant difference regarding oncological outcome distinguished between ORP vs RARP. For functional outcomes, the 1-week continence rates were higher in the ORP group (25.8% vs 21.8%, P < 0.001). At 3 months, no statistically significant differences were observed. At 12 months, continence rates were modestly higher in the RARP group (90.3% vs 88.8%, P = 0.01). This effect was no longer observed after stratification for age-groups. The 12-month potency rates were similar in ORP vs RARP (80.3% vs 83.6%, P = 0.33). For surgical outcomes, there was no significant difference in the rates of NS procedures, lymph node yield, SM status, and LOS. Conversely, operation time was shorter in ORP, and blood loss, transfusion rates and time to catheter removal were significantly lower in RARP.  Conclusions:   Both surgical approaches, performed in a high-volume centre by the same surgeons, achieve excellent, comparable oncological and functional outcomes. However, a modest advantage for RARP for surgical outcomes was observed, most likely attributable to its minimally invasive nature, and better teaching capabilities. Consequently, more than the surgical approach itself, the well-trained surgeon remains the most important factor to achieve satisfactory outcomes.""","""['Alexander Haese', 'Sophie Knipper', 'Hendrik Isbarn', 'Hans Heinzer', 'Derya Tilki', 'Georg Salomon', 'Uwe Michl', 'Thomas Steuber', 'Lars Budäus', 'Tobias Maurer', 'Pierre Tennstedt', 'Hartwig Huland', 'Markus Graefen']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""BJU Int""","""['Re: A Comparative Study of Robot-assisted and Open Radical Prostatectomy in 10 790 Men Treated by Highly Trained Surgeons for Both Procedures.', 'Retzius-sparing robot-assisted radical prostatectomy versus open retropubic radical prostatectomy: a prospective comparative study with 19-month follow-up.', 'Comparison of oncological and health-related quality of life outcomes between open and robot-assisted radical prostatectomy for localised\xa0prostate cancer - findings from the population-based Victorian Prostate Cancer Registry.', 'Patterns-of-care and health economic analysis of robot-assisted radical prostatectomy in the Australian public health system.', 'Laparoscopic and robotic-assisted versus open radical prostatectomy for the treatment of localised prostate cancer.', 'Robot-Assisted Radical Prostatectomy Is More Beneficial for Prostate Cancer Patients: A System Review and Meta-Analysis.', 'Erectile Dysfunction in Pelvic Cancer Survivors and Current Management Options.', 'Diabetes mellitus lowers the chance of short-term urinary continence recovery in prostate cancer patients undergoing radical prostatectomy.', 'Full functional-length urethral sphincter- and neurovascular bundle preservation improves long-term continence rates after robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy.', 'Robot-assisted radical prostatectomy in the treatment of patients with clinically high-risk localized and locally advanced prostate cancer: single surgeons functional and oncologic outcomes.', 'Urethral Sphincter Length but Not Prostatic Apex Shape in Preoperative MRI Is Associated with Mid-Term Continence Rates after Radical Prostatectomy.']"""

This study examined cancer patients' perceptions of the communication with their cancer specialists and explored its impact on the care they received and the financial burden they experienced.  Methods:   Semi-structured telephone interviews were conducted with 20 rural and 20 outer metropolitan Western Australians diagnosed with breast, lung, prostate or colorectal cancer. Thematic analysis using a phenomenological approach was undertaken to derive key themes regarding the communication experiences of the participants.  Results:   Four main themes emerged: information context, communication about treatment options and treatment providers, communication about costs of treatment and impact of communication on continuity of care. The quality of the communication experienced by participants was variable and in many cases sub-optimal. This affected their ability to undertake well-informed decisions regarding treatment and providers and led to substantial out-of-pocket expenses for several participants. Whilst participants differed in their information needs and expectations, most participants trusted clinicians' treatment recommendations.  Conclusions:   Our results raise concerns about the quality of communication cancer patients receive during treatment and the repercussions for their treatment decisions and out-of-pocket expenses. Clear treatment and cost communication could empower patients in choosing treatment and providers.

We propose that p53 gene therapy and chemotherapy, when combined, will provide superior tumor cell killing for the treatment of prostate carcinoma. To this end, we have developed the AdRGD-PGp53 vector which offers autoregulated expression of p53, resulting in enhanced tumor cell killing in vitro and in vivo. Here, we combined AdRGD-PGp53 along with the chemotherapy drugs used in the clinical treatment of prostate carcinoma, mitoxantrone, docetaxel, or cabazitaxel. Our results indicate that all drugs increase phosphorylation of p53, leading to improved induction of p53 targets. In vitro experiments reveal that AdRGD-PGp53 sensitizes prostate cancer cells to each of the drugs tested, conferring increased levels of cell death. In a xenograft mouse model of in situ gene therapy, AdRGD-PGp53 treatment, when combined with cabazitaxel, drastically reduced tumor progression and increased survival rates to 100%. Strikingly, we used a sub-therapeutic dose of cabazitaxel thus avoiding leukopenia, yet still showed potent anti-tumor effects when combined with AdRGD-PGp53 in this mouse model.

Patients who had not switched to chemotherapy were censored at the last follow-up date (median of 36 mo; range, 12-108 mo). Cox regression analyses were performed to examine the association between PET/CT measurements: sum of SUVmax, maximum SUVmax, and average SUVmax for up to 10 of the most active lesions and THTF. Survival probabilities were based on the Kaplan-Meier method. Results: 43 patients had hormonal treatment failure, and 8 died without documented treatment failure. Median THTF was 26.5 mo (95% confidence interval [CI], 15.5-46.6 mo). The THTF-free probability at 5 y was 35% ± 6%.

Loss of the tumor suppressor PTEN, a frequent event in prostate cancer, leads to PTK6 activation at the plasma membrane and its oncogenic signaling. The small molecule inhibitor vemurafenib, also known as PLX4032, and its tool analog PLX4720 were designed to inhibit constitutively active BRAF V600E, yet they also have potent effects against PTK6. Vemurafenib is used in the treatment of metastatic melanoma, but its efficacy in prostate cancer has not been assessed. When activated at the plasma membrane, PTK6 promotes signaling through FAK, EGFR, and ERK1/2, and we show this can be blocked by vemurafenib. In addition, PTK6-mediated cell growth, migration, and invasion are inhibited upon vemurafenib administration. Using a flank xenograft model, vemurafenib treatment reduced tumor burden. Using saturation transfer difference NMR and molecular docking, we demonstrate that vemurafenib binds in the active site of PTK6, inhibiting its activation.

Methods and materials:   Disease status was evaluated by systematic biopsies and 3T multiparametric MRI. The brachytherapy implant procedure under fused transrectal ultrasound/MRI guidance was followed by a 1.5 T MRI for contour adjustments and catheter position verification. A single dose of 19 Gy was delivered to the tumor with a margin of 5 mm. Genitourinary (GU) toxicity, gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity, and erectile dysfunction (ED) were graded with the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.0. QoL was measured with RAND-36, European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer QLQ-C30 and PR25. International Prostate Symptom Scores and International Index of Erectile Function scores were obtained. Prostate-specific antigen level was monitored, with biochemical recurrence defined as nadir + 2 ng/mL (Phoenix).  Results:   Thirty patients with National Comprehensive Cancer Network low- (13%) to intermediate-risk (87%) prostate cancer were treated between May 2013 and April 2016. Median follow-up was 4 years. Median age was 71 years (interquartile range, 68-73) and median initial prostate-specific antigen level was 7.3 ng/mL (5.2-8.1). Maximum Gleason score was 4 + 3 = 7 (in 2 patients).

However, the immunotherapeutic effect of prostate cancer is unsatisfactory. We found that the expression of TRIB1 was significantly correlated with the infiltration of CD163+ macrophages in prostate cancer. This study focused on the effects of TRIB1 on macrophage polarization in the immune microenvironment of prostate cancer. RNA sequencing analysis demonstrated that TRIB1 has significant effects on the regulation of the nuclear factor (NF)-κB signaling pathway and downstream cytokines. Flow cytometry and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay were used to examine THP-1 cells cultured in conditioned medium from prostate cancer cells overexpressing TRIB1 and showed that overexpression of TRIB1 promoted the secretion of CXCL2 and interleukin (IL)8 by PC3 cells, which increased the secretion of IL12 by THP-1 cells as well as the expression of CD163 on THP-1 cells. IKB-zeta, regulated by TRIB1, was expressed in PC3 cells but was barely detectable in DU145 cells. The reductions in CXCL2 and IL8 by the inhibition of TRIB1 were rescued by the deletion of IKB-zeta.

Methods:   A retrospective cohort of 211 patients that had at least 1 suspected MR lesion, Prostate Imaging-Reporting and Data System ≥3, and subsequent biopsy (2015-2017). Clinical characteristics and prognostic biomarkers were evaluated as predictors of prostate cancer detection by type of biopsy guidance (fused vs nonfused).  Results:   One-hundred twenty-one patients had nonfused and 90 had fused biopsies. PHI and PHID had greater area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC) in predicting positive biopsies than prostate-specific antigen or PSAD for both nonfused and fused biopsy. PHI 0.78 (95% CI 0.67-0.88) and PHID 0.82 (95% CI 0.73-0.91) had the greatest AUC for predicting biopsy results for nonfused and fused biopsies, respectively. Multiple-variable models did not improve model fit compared to single variables. Based on Youden's index, a cut-off value of 45.9 for PHI in nonfused and 0.64 for PHID in fused biopsies would reduce the number of negative biopsies by 77.3% and 63.4%, respectively, but the percentage of missed clinically significant cancer biopsies would be 19% and 12%, respectively.

DDX3, an RNA helicase, has widespread functions in RNA regulation, in both the nucleus and cytoplasm. Although DDX3 has been implicated as a prognostic marker for many cancers, including primary CaP, its expression, localization, and function in metastatic CaP have not been investigated. Analysis of metadata and cell line models found increased DDX3 expression in metastatic versus primary CaP and benign prostate. Quantification of DDX3 expression in 320 human prostate samples, representing different stages of CaP progression, revealed an increase in epithelial whole cell, cytoplasmic, and nuclear DDX3 in primary CaP compared with benign prostate. In metastatic tissues, cytoplasmic DDX3 remained highly expressed, whereas nuclear DDX3 significantly decreased compared with primary CaP, suggesting a potential role for cytoplasmic DDX3 in metastatic CaP. Genetic and pharmacologic loss of function for DDX3 in metastatic CaP produced a significant decrease in cell viability, proliferation, and motility but did not affect apoptosis. The data suggest that cytoplasmic DDX3 is highly expressed in metastatic CaP and that inhibition of DDX3 affects metastatic growth by decreasing proliferation and motility. These findings introduce a novel role for cytoplasmic DDX3 in CaP progression and provide a foundation for clinically targeting DDX3 in metastatic CaP.""","""['Jordan E Vellky', 'Emily A Ricke', 'Wei Huang', 'William A Ricke']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Am J Pathol""","""['The prognostic effect of DDX3 upregulation in distant breast cancer metastases.', 'DDX3 Represses Stemness by Epigenetically Modulating Tumor-suppressive miRNAs in Hepatocellular Carcinoma.', 'DDX3, a DEAD box RNA helicase, is deregulated in hepatitis virus-associated hepatocellular carcinoma and is involved in cell growth control.', 'DDX3, a potential target for cancer treatment.', 'A double-edged function of DDX3, as an oncogene or tumor suppressor, in cancer progression (Review).', 'DEAD-box RNA helicases with special reference to p68: Unwinding their biology, versatility, and therapeutic opportunity in cancer.', 'Toxicoproteomics of Mono(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate and Perfluorooctanesulfonic Acid in Models of Prostatic Diseases.', 'The role of long non-coding RNA HCG18 in cancer.', 'DEAD-Box RNA Helicases DDX3X and DDX5 as Oncogenes or Oncosuppressors: A Network Perspective.', 'DDX3 acts as a tumor suppressor in colorectal cancer as loss of DDX3 in advanced cancer promotes tumor progression by activating the MAPK pathway.']"""

Electrochemical pretreatment and measurement of the gold-coated magnetic probes allows highly sensitive, precise, and robust system for quantification of target analytes. Using MESIA, the concentration of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) in 10 μl of human serum is determined within 5 min. The limit of detection is 0.085 ng/mL, and the average coefficient of variance is 8.85% for five different PSA concentrations ranging from 0 to 25 ng/mL. This method shows good precision and reproducibility (<10%) and high correlation with cobas e 801 (r = 0.997) for clinical patient samples.

Genes covered by recurrent CNAs were submitted to enrichment and cross-validation analysis. In addition, the expression levels of TP53, MDM2 and ZBTB4 were evaluated in an independent set of cases by qPCR. PC cases presented genomic complexity, while PIA samples had a small number of CNAs. Recurrent losses covering well-known tumor suppressor genes, such as ATM, BRCA1, CDH1, MEN1 and TP53, were found in PC. The in silico functional analysis showed several cancer-related genes associated with canonical pathways and interaction networks previously described in human PC. The MDM2, TP53, and ZBTB4 copy number alterations were translated into altered expression levels.

Treatment of this patient population, e.g. by (chemical) castration, is primarily focused on depletion of tumor-stimulating androgens, with testosterone being the major androgenic hormone.

Anti-hormonal drugs abiraterone acetate and enzalutamide are commonly used to treat patients with this disease as both drugs reduce tumor growth and increase time to tumor progression. To evaluate the pharmacodynamic effects of anti-hormonal drugs in this patient population, we developed an LC-MS/MS method for the quantification of testosterone, dihydrotestosterone, androstenedione, cortisol and prednisone in human plasma. The validated assay ranges from 10-10,000 pg/mL for testosterone and androstenedione, 100-10,000 pg/mL for dihydrotestosterone, 50-5000 pg/mL for cortisol and 500-50,000 pg/mL for prednisone.

We hypothesized that intervention-group participants would have more confident symptom self-management and reduced symptom burden.  Methods:   A total of 556 prostate cancer survivors who, more than 1 year after treatment, were experiencing symptom burden were recruited from April 2015 to February 2017 across four Veterans Affairs sites. Participants were randomly assigned to intervention (n = 278) or usual care (n = 278) groups. We compared differences in the primary (symptom burden according to Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite-26 [EPIC], confidence in self-management) and secondary outcomes between groups using intent-to-treat analyses. We compared domain-specific changes in symptom burden from baseline to 5 and 12 months among the intervention group according to the primary symptom focus area (urinary, bowel, sexual, general) of participants.  Results:   Most of the prostate cancer survivors in this study were married (54.3%), were white (69.2%), were retired (62.4%), and underwent radiation therapy (56.7% v 46.2% who underwent surgery), and the mean age was 67 years. There were no baseline differences in urinary, bowel, sexual, or hormonal domain EPIC scores across groups. We observed higher EPIC scores in the intervention arm in all domain areas at 5 months, though differences were not statistically significant. No differences were found in secondary outcomes; however, coping appraisal was higher (2.8 v 2.6; P = .02) in intervention-arm patients at 5 months. In subgroup analyses, intervention participants reported improvement from baseline at 5 and 12 months in their symptom focus area domains.

Through its unique covalent-binding with β-tubulin, zampanolide exhibits cytotoxic potency towards multi-drug resistant cancer cells that is superior to paclitaxel. However, the limited availability of zampanolide impedes its further in vivo evaluation as a viable drug candidate. Zampanolide is envisioned to become more drug-like if its chemically fragile side chain can be stabilized; hence, this project aims to develop mimics of zampanolide with a stable side chain using straightforward synthetic methods. To this end, twelve novel zampanolide mimics (51-62) with conjugated and planar side chains have been synthesized via a 24-step sequence for each mimic from commercially available 2-butyn-1-ol as starting material. A Horner-Wadsworth-Emmons reaction incorporates the α,β-unsaturated ketone side chain and also closes the core macrocycle. WST-1 cell proliferation assays in three docetaxel-sensitive and two docetaxel-resistant human prostate cancer cell models confirm that a suitably designed side chain can serve as a bioisostere for the N-acyl hemiaminal side chain in zampanolide. Mimic 52 with a 17R chiral center was identified as the optimal candidate with IC50 values of 0.29-0.46 μM against both docetaxel-sensitive (PC-3 and DU145) and docetaxel-resistant prostate cancer cell lines (PC-3/DTX and DU145/DTX). Zampanolide mimic 52 exhibited equivalent antiproliferative potency towards both docetaxel-sensitive and docetaxel-resistant cell lines, with relative resistance in the range of 0.9-1.6.""","""['Guanglin Chen', 'Manee Patanapongpibul', 'Ziran Jiang', 'Qiang Zhang', 'Shilong Zheng', 'Guangdi Wang', 'James D White', 'Qiao-Hong Chen']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Org Biomol Chem""","""['An amide mimic of desTHPdactylolide: Total synthesis and antiproliferative evaluation.', 'New Zampanolide Mimics: Design, Synthesis, and Antiproliferative Evaluation.', 'Optimized synthesis and antiproliferative activity of desTHPdactylolides.', 'Zampanolide and dactylolide: cytotoxic tubulin-assembly agents and promising anticancer leads.', 'Discovery and Development of Macrolides as Anticancer Agents.', 'In Vivo Evaluation of (-)-Zampanolide Demonstrates Potent and Persistent Antitumor Efficacy When Targeted to the Tumor Site.', 'An amide mimic of desTHPdactylolide: Total synthesis and antiproliferative evaluation.', 'New Zampanolide Mimics: Design, Synthesis, and Antiproliferative Evaluation.']"""

In spite of a largely wild-type nuclear genome, CCPAP tumors exhibit severe depletion of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and RNA and high levels of oxidative stress, reflecting a shift away from respiratory metabolism. Moreover, CCPAP tumors exhibit a distinct metabolic phenotype uniquely characterized by accumulation of the sugar alcohol sorbitol. Immunohistochemical staining of primary CCPAP tumor specimens recapitulates both the depletion of mtDNA-encoded proteins and a lipid-depleted metabolic phenotype, suggesting that the cytoplasmic clarity in CCPAP is primarily related to the presence of glycogen.

Here we show that the combination of I-CBP112 and A-485 can synergize to inhibit prostate cancer cell proliferation. We find that the combination confers a dramatic reduction in p300 chromatin occupancy compared to the individual effects of blocking either domain alone. Accompanying this loss of p300 on chromatin, combination treatment leads to the reduction of specific mRNAs including androgen-dependent and pro-oncogenic prostate genes such as KLK3 (PSA) and c-Myc. Consistent with p300 directly affecting gene expression, mRNAs that are significantly reduced by combination treatment also exhibit a strong reduction in p300 chromatin occupancy at their gene promoters. The relatively few mRNAs that are up-regulated upon combination treatment show no correlation with p300 occupancy.

We developed risk calculators based on 635 men who underwent initial prostate biopsy. Then, we validated the performance of prostate-specific antigen (PSA), phi, and the risk calculators in an additional observational cohort of 1045 men. We observed that the phi-based risk calculators (risk calculators 2 and 4) outperformed the PSA-based risk calculator for predicting PCa and high-grade PCa in the training cohort. In the validation study, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) for risk calculators 2 and 4 reached 0.91 and 0.92, respectively, for predicting PCa and high-grade PCa, respectively; the AUC values were better than those for risk calculator 1 (PSA-based model with an AUC of 0.81 and 0.82, respectively) (all P < 0.001). Such superiority was also observed in the stratified population with PSA ranging from 2.0 ng ml-1to 10.0 ng ml-1. Decision curves confirmed that a considerable proportion of unnecessary biopsies could be avoided while applying phi-based risk calculators.

We developed an optimized biopsy tissue culture protocol in combination with [1,6-13 C2 ]glucose labeling and quantitative high-resolution NMR to measure glycolysis and tricarboxcylic acid (TCA) cycle activity in freshly acquired living human prostate biopsies.  Methods:   We acquired 34 MRI-ultrasound fusion-guided prostate biopsies in vials on ice from 22 previously untreated patients. Within 15 min, biopsies were transferred to rotary tissue culture in 37°C prostate medium containing [1,6-13 C2 ]glucose. Following 24 h of culture, tissue lactate and glutamate pool sizes and fractional enrichments were quantified using quantitative 1 H high resolution magic angle spinning Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill (CPMG) spectroscopy at 1°C with and without 13 C decoupling. Lactate effluxed from the biopsy tissue was quantified in the culture medium using quantitative solution-state high-resolution NMR.  Results:   Lactate concentration in low-grade cancer (1.15 ± 0.78 nmol/mg) and benign (0.74 ± 0.15 nmol/mg) biopsies agreed with prior published measurements of snap-frozen biopsies. There was substantial fractional enrichment of [3-13 C]lactate (≈70%) and [4-13 C]glutamate (≈24%) in both low-grade cancer and benign biopsies. Although a significant difference in tissue [3-13 C]lactate fractional enrichment was not observed, lactate efflux was significantly higher (P < 0.05) in low-grade cancer biopsies (0.55 ± 0.14 nmol/min/mg) versus benign biopsies (0.31 ± 0.04 nmol/min/mg).

Previous studies have confirmed that emodin has inhibitory effects on various solid tumors, such as osteosarcoma, liver cancer, prostate cancer and glioma. This study aimed to investigate the effects and mechanisms of emodin-induced necroptosis in the glioma cell line U251 by targeting the TNF-α/RIP1/RIP3 signaling pathway. We found that emodin could significantly inhibit U251 cell proliferation, and the viability of U251 cells treated with emodin was reduced in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Flow cytometry assays and Hoechst-PI staining assays showed that emodin induced apoptosis and necroptosis. Real-time PCR and western blot analysis showed that emodin upregulated the levels of TNF-α, RIP1, RIP3 and MLKL. Furthermore, the RIP1 inhibitor Nec-1 and the RIP3 inhibitor GSK872 attenuated the killing effect of emodin on U251 cells. In addition, emodin could increase the levels of TNF-α, RIP1, RIP3 and MLKL in vivo. The results demonstrate that emodin could induce necroptosis in glioma possibly through the activation of the TNF-α/RIP1/RIP3 axis.

No significant relationship was found between erectile dysfunction and prostate-specific antigen level, prostate volume, and the pathology result (P = 0.320, 0.509, and 0.131). The mean questionnaire score 1 month before and after the biopsy was 23 and 18, respectively; it demonstrated a significant difference (P < 0.001). The same score was 17 and 14.5 three and six months after biopsy. The mean score 1 m before and 3 m after biopsy also revealed a significant difference (P < 0.001).  Conclusion:   Transrectal ultrasound-guided needle biopsy of the prostate causes progressive erectile dysfunction in these patients.

For 11 prostate patients, we simulated treatment plan delivery using the patients' daily anatomy as observed in the planning CT and 7-9 control CT scans, including the detected PG profiles resulting from the 5%, 10%, and 20% most intense proton pencil beams. For each patient, we determined the changes in dosimetric parameters for the high- and low-dose PTVs between the simulations performed using the planning CT scan and the different control CT scans and correlated these to changes in the PG emission profiles. Changes in coverage of the high- and low-dose PTV correlated most strongly with the median and mean absolute PG emission profile shifts of the 5% most intense pencil beams, respectively. With a mean Pearson correlation coefficient of -0.76 (SD: 0.17) for the high-dose PTV and of -0.60 (SD: 0.51) for the low-dose PTV.

However, the mechanisms underlying the oncogenesis of PCa and CRPC remain elusive. Lysine-specific histone demethylase 5C (KDM5C) is an important member of lysine demethylase family and has recently been found highly expressed in multiple cancer types. In this study, we reported that KDM5C was highly expressed in PCa and CRPC specimens, and the high expression promoted CRPC cell proliferation through repressing phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) gene epigenetically. Moreover, KDM5C was transcriptionally upregulated by bromodomain-containing protein 4 (BRD4), and knockdown KDM5C sensitized the therapeutic effects of CRPC cells to the bromodomain and extraterminal (BET) inhibitor. Taken together, our study uncovers that the BRD4-KDM5C-PTEN may be a new oncogenic pathway in CRPC development, and KDM5C is a critical protein and could be an ideal target for CRPC treatment in this oncogenic pathway.""","""['Zhe Hong', 'Gang Wu', 'Zhen-Dong Xiang', 'Cheng-Dang Xu', 'Sheng-Song Huang', 'Chao Li', 'Lei Shi', 'Deng-Long Wu']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Biomed Pharmacother""","""['c-MYC drives histone demethylase PHF8 during neuroendocrine differentiation and in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'BET bromodomain-mediated interaction between ERG and BRD4 promotes prostate cancer cell invasion.', 'Patient-derived Hormone-naive Prostate Cancer Xenograft Models Reveal Growth Factor Receptor Bound Protein 10 as an Androgen Receptor-repressed Gene Driving the Development of Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Molecular and cellular events linking variants in the histone demethylase KDM5C to the intellectual disability disorder Claes-Jensen syndrome.', 'New approaches to targeting epigenetic regulation in prostate cancer.', 'The KDM5B and KDM1A lysine demethylases cooperate in regulating androgen receptor expression and signalling in prostate cancer.', 'Targeting epigenetic regulators to overcome drug resistance in cancers.', 'Exploring anti-androgen therapies in hormone dependent prostate cancer and new therapeutic routes for castration resistant prostate cancer.', 'Diverse Functions of KDM5 in Cancer: Transcriptional Repressor or Activator?', 'Lysine demethylase 5A promotes prostate adenocarcinoma progression by suppressing microRNA-330-3p expression and activating the COPB2/PI3K/AKT axis in an ETS1-dependent manner.']"""

Objective:   To assess 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET accuracy in a prospective multicenter trial.  Design, setting, and participants:   In this single-arm prospective trial conducted at University of California, San Francisco and University of California, Los Angeles, 635 patients with biochemically recurrent prostate cancer after prostatectomy (n = 262, 41%), radiation therapy (n = 169, 27%), or both (n = 204, 32%) underwent 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET. Presence of prostate cancer was recorded by 3 blinded readers on a per-patient and per-region base. Lesions were validated by histopathologic analysis and a composite reference standard.  Main outcomes and measures:   Endpoints were positive predictive value (PPV), detection rate, interreader reproducibility, and safety.  Results:   A total of 635 men were enrolled with a median age of 69 years (range, 44-95 years). On a per-patient basis, PPV was 0.84 (95% CI, 0.75-0.90) by histopathologic validation (primary endpoint, n = 87) and 0.92 (95% CI, 0.88-0.95) by the composite reference standard (n = 217). 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET localized recurrent prostate cancer in 475 of 635 (75%) patients; detection rates significantly increased with prostate-specific antigen (PSA): 38% for <0.5 ng/mL (n = 136), 57% for 0.5 to <1.0 ng/mL (n = 79), 84% for 1.0 to <2.0 ng/mL (n = 89), 86% for 2.0 to <5.0 ng/mL (n = 158), and 97% for ≥5.0 ng/mL (n = 173, P < .001). Interreader reproducibility was substantial (Fleiss κ, 0.65-0.78). There were no serious adverse events associated with 68Ga-PSMA-11 administration.

Mobius3D calculates three-dimensional (3D) patient dose using reference beam data and a collapsed cone convolution algorithm and analyzes dose-volume histogram automatically. There are currently no published data on commissioning and determining tolerance levels of Mobius3D for TomoTherapy. To verify the calculation accuracy and adjust the parameters of this system, we compared the measured dose using an ion chamber and film in a phantom with the dose calculated using Mobius3D for nine helical intensity-modulated radiation therapy plans, each with three nominal field widths. We also compared 126 treatment plans used in our institution to treat prostate, head-and-neck, and esophagus tumors based on dose calculations by treatment planning system for given dose indices and 3D gamma passing rates with those produced by Mobius3D. On the basis of these results, we showed that the action and tolerance levels at the average dose for the planning target volume (PTV) at each treatment site are at μ ± 2σ and μ ± 3σ, respectively. After adjusting parameters, the dose difference ratio on average was -0.2 ± 0.6% using ion chamber and gamma passing rate with the criteria of 3% and 3 mm on average was 98.8 ± 1.4% using film. We also established action and tolerance levels for the PTV at the prostate, head-and-neck, esophagus, and for the organ at risk at all treatment sites. Mobius3D calculations thus provide an accurate secondary dose verification system that can be commissioned easily and immediately after installation. Before clinical use, the Mobius3D system needs to be commissioned using the treatment plans for patients treated in each institution to determine the calculational accuracy and establish tolerances for each treatment site and dose index.""","""['Takumi Kodama', 'Yoshihiro Saito', 'Shogo Hatanaka', 'Masatsugu Hariu', 'Munefumi Shimbo', 'Takeo Takahashi']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""J Appl Clin Med Phys""","""['Clinical implementation of Dosimetry Check™ for TomoTherapy® delivery quality assurance.', 'Dose verification of an IMRT treatment planning system with the BEAM EGS4-based Monte Carlo code.', 'Independent absorbed-dose calculation using the Monte Carlo algorithm in volumetric modulated arc therapy.', 'Phantomless patient-specific TomoTherapy QA via delivery performance monitoring and a secondary Monte Carlo dose calculation.', 'Assessment of Monte Carlo algorithm for compliance with RTOG 0915 dosimetric criteria in peripheral lung cancer patients treated with stereotactic body radiotherapy.', 'Validation of a secondary dose check tool against Monte Carlo and analytical clinical dose calculation algorithms in VMAT.', 'Characteristics and limitations of a secondary dose check software for VMAT plan calculation.']"""

Key findings:   There is a reduction in cellular viability in R compared to C at all evaluated times, and an increased cell viability in G when compared to R; cell viability was similar in C and G in all times studied. The migration assay demonstrated a significant decrease in migration potential of tumour cells in R compared to C and G.

The study included 2,143 OTRs with cancer, and 946,089 nontransplanted cancer patients diagnosed 1992-2013. Hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated using Cox regression models adjusted for age, sex and calendar year. Median follow-up was 3.1 (range 0-22) years. Overall, OTRs diagnosed with any cancer had a 35% higher rate of cancer death compared to nontransplanted cancer patients (HR: 1.35, 95% CI: 1.24-1.47). Specifically, higher rates of cancer-specific death were observed among OTRs diagnosed with Hodgkin lymphoma (HR: 15.0, 95% CI: 5.56-40.6), high-grade non-Hodgkin lymphoma (HR: 2.68, 95% CI: 1.90-3.77), malignant melanoma (HR: 2.80, 95% CI: 1.74-4.52) and urothelial (HR: 2.56, 95% CI: 1.65-3.97), breast (HR: 2.12, 95% CI: 1.38-3.25), head/neck (HR: 1.55, 95% CI: 1.02-2.36) and colorectal (HR: 1.42, 95% CI: 1.07-1.88) cancer. The worse outcomes were not explained by differences in distribution of cancer stage or histologic subtypes. For other common cancer forms such as prostate, lung and kidney cancer, the prognosis was similar to that in nontransplanted cancer patients.

We attempted to develop a new comorbidity assessment tool based on individual comorbid conditions and/or BCa manifestations for specific prediction of perioperative mortality after RC.  Methods:   We relied on 7076 T1-T4 nonmetastatic BCa patients treated with RC between 2000 and 2009 in the SEER-Medicare linked database. Within the development cohort (n = 6076), simulated annealing (SA) was used to identify (1) individual comorbid conditions, (2) individual BCa manifestations, and (3) the combination of both, that satisfy the criteria of maximal accuracy and parsimony for prediction of 90-day mortality after RC, after adjusting for several confounders.

Patients were assessed if they had a febrile urinary tract infection (FUTI). The incidence of FUTI was compared among groups. Subgroup analysis was performed between patients at high and low risk of infection in each group. There were 15 cases developed FUTI: 7 (5%), 6 (4.3%), and 2 (1.4%), respectively, in groups A, B, and C. Of the 15 patients who developed FUTI, Escherichia coli was detected in blood culture in two cases. Urine culture results were all negative. FUTI patients (73.3% (11/15)) had at least one high risk factor. Subgroup analysis showed that the incidence of FUTI in group A was significantly higher than that in group C among high-risk patients. There was no statistical difference between group A and group B among both high- and low-risk patients. A single 500-mg dose of levofloxacin without enema represents excellent prophylaxis for transrectal prostate biopsy in Chinese patients at low risk of infection.

Statistical models based on gamma distribution can describe diffusion signal decay curves of prostate cancer. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the ability of parameters obtained with the gamma model in differentiating prostate cancers with different Gleason score values.  Methods:   This study included 155 patients with prostate cancer who underwent multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging prior to prostate biopsy (127 patients) or radical prostatectomy (28 patients) between January 2015 and June 2017; 159 foci of prostate cancer were included in our study.

We here describe another case of this disorder that was clinically typical based on prior reports as it showed hypercortisolemia and severe hypokalemia with multiple metastasis. However, our current case of prostate SCC causing EAS is the first to display negative immunostaining for ACTH despite detectable POMC mRNA expression in the primary lesion. ACTH immunonegativity is thought to be associated with a more aggressive disease course and a poorer prognosis although there are few studies of the underlying mechanisms. We explored two possibilities for this finding in our current patient: aberrant POMC processing prevented immunodetection with an anti-ACTH antibody; and the ACTH content per cell was below the threshold for immunodetection due to its rapid secretion or low synthesis. The aberrant processing theory was thought to be less likely because of immunonegative findings even using anti-POMC/ACTH antibodies. As the plasma ACTH levels in our patient were comparable with those reported for previous immunopositive prostate EAS cases, we speculated that the depletion of ACTH may be caused not only by rapid secretion but also by low production levels as a sign of de-differentiation. De-differentiation may therefore explain the mechanism underlying the negative correlation between immunoreactivity for ACTH in EAS and disease aggressiveness.

BRD inhibitors have shown promise for treatment of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC), and have been shown to function even in the context of resistance to next-generation AR-targeted therapies such as enzalutamide and abiraterone. Their clinical translation, however, has been limited by off-target effects, toxicity, and rapid resistance.  Experimental design:   We have developed a series of molecules that target BET bromodomain proteins through their proteasomal degradation, improving efficacy and specificity of standard inhibitors. We tested their efficacy by utilizing prostate cancer cell lines and patient-derived xenografts, as well as several techniques including RNA-sequencing, mass spectroscopic proteomics, and lipidomics.  Results:   BET degraders function in vitro and in vivo to suppress prostate cancer growth. These drugs preferentially affect AR-positive prostate cancer cells (22Rv1, LNCaP, VCaP) over AR-negative cells (PC3 and DU145), and proteomic and genomic mechanistic studies confirm disruption of oncogenic AR and MYC signaling at lower concentrations than BET inhibitors. We also identified increases in polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) and thioredoxin-interacting protein (TXNIP) as potential pharmacodynamics biomarkers for targeting BET proteins.

The performance of the radiomics features, PSA level and Gleason Score were explored with the respect to the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve. Multivariable logistic regression analysis starting with the following clinical risk factors (PSA level, Gleason Score and age) and imaging biomarkers were applied to develop diagnostic model for BM in PCa.  Results:   The texture features, which consisted of 15 selected features, were significantly associated with BM (P < 0.01). The combined MRI features derived from T2-w and DCE T1-w showed better prognostic performance (AUC = 0.898) than features derived from single sequence (T2WI AUC = 0.875, DCE T1-w AUC = 0.870) and Gleason Score (AUC = 0.731) for pre-treatment prediction of BM in PCa.

The tumor-suppressive TET enzymes, which are involved in DNA demethylation, are decreased in prostate cancer (PCa); in particular, TET2 is specifically targeted by androgen-dependent mechanisms of repression in PCa and may play a central role in carcinogenesis. Thus, the identification of key genes targeted by TET2 dysregulation may provide further insight into cancer biology.  Results:   Using a CRISPR/Cas9-derived TET2-knockout prostate cell line, and through whole-transcriptome and whole-methylome sequencing, we identified seven candidate genes-ASB2, ETNK2, MEIS2, NRG1, NTN1, NUDT10, and SRPX-exhibiting reduced expression and increased promoter methylation, a pattern characteristic of tumor suppressors. Decreased expression of these genes significantly discriminates between recurrent and non-recurrent prostate tumors from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) cohort (n = 423), and ASB2, NUDT10, and SRPX were significantly correlated with lower recurrence-free survival in patients by Kaplan-Meier analysis. ASB2, MEIS2, and SRPX also showed significantly lower expression in high-risk Gleason score 8 tumors as compared to low or intermediate risk tumors, suggesting that these genes may be particularly useful as indicators of PCa progression. Furthermore, methylation array probes in the TCGA dataset, which were proximal to the highly conserved, differentially methylated sites identified in our TET2-knockout cells, were able to significantly distinguish between matched prostate tumor and normal prostate tissues (n = 50 pairs). Except ASB2, all genes exhibited significantly increased methylation at these probes, and methylation status of at least one probe for each of these genes showed association with measures of PCa progression such as recurrence, stage, or Gleason score. Since ASB2 did not have any probes within the TET2-knockout differentially methylated region, we validated ASB2 methylation in an independent series of matched tumor-normal samples (n = 19) by methylation-specific qPCR, which revealed concordant and significant increases in promoter methylation within the TET2-knockout site.  Conclusions:   Our study identifies seven genes governed by TET2 loss in PCa which exhibit an association between their methylation and expression status and measures of PCa progression. As differential methylation profiles and TET2 expression are associated with advanced PCa, further investigation of these specialized TET2 targets may provide important insights into patterns of carcinogenic gene dysregulation.""","""['Shivani Kamdar', 'Ruth Isserlin', 'Theodorus Van der Kwast', 'Alexandre R Zlotta', 'Gary D Bader', 'Neil E Fleshner', 'Bharati Bapat']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Clin Epigenetics""","""['GBX2 Methylation Is a Novel Prognostic Biomarker and Improves Prediction of Biochemical Recurrence Among Patients with Prostate Cancer Negative for Intraductal Carcinoma and Cribriform Architecture.', 'TET2 repression by androgen hormone regulates global hydroxymethylation status and prostate cancer progression.', 'Random forest-based modelling to detect biomarkers for prostate cancer progression.', 'Dysregulation of TET2 in hematologic malignancies.', 'Enriching gene expression profiles will help personalize prostate cancer management for African-Americans: A perspective.', 'Comprehensive analysis the diagnosis, malignant progression and immune infiltrate of ANXA6 in prostate cancer.', 'Recent advances in understanding DNA methylation of prostate cancer.', 'Metabolic genes, a potential predictor of prognosis and immunogenicity of clear cell renal cell carcinoma.', 'ETNK2 Low-Expression Predicts Poor Prognosis in Renal Cell Carcinoma with Immunosuppressive Tumor Microenvironment.', 'M7G-related molecular subtypes can predict the prognosis and correlate with immunotherapy and chemotherapy responses in bladder cancer patients.']"""

The paradigm represents continuous rural-urban transition as discrete groups, which results in a loss of ordering information and landscape continuum, and thus may contribute to mixed findings in the literature. Few studies have examined the validity of using rural-urban codes as continuous variables in the same analysis. Methods: We geocoded cancer cases in north central Florida between 2005 and 2010 collected by Florida Cancer Data System. Using a linear hierarchical model, we regressed the occurrence of late stage cancer (including breast, colorectal, hematological, lung, and prostate cancer) on the rural-urban codes as continuous variables. To validate, the results were compared to those from using a truly continuous rurality data of the same study region. Results: In term of associations with late-stage cancer risk, the regression analysis showed that the use of rural-urban codes as continuous variables produces consistent outcomes with those from the truly continuous rurality for all types of cancer. Particularly, the rural-urban codes at the census tract level yield the closest estimation and are recommended to use when the continuous rurality data is not available. Conclusions: Methodologically, it is valid to treat rural-urban codes directly as continuous variables in cancer studies, in addition to converting them into categories. This proposed continuous-variable method offers researchers more flexibility in their choice of analytic methods and preserves the information in the ordering. It can better inform how cancer risk varies, degree by degree, over a finer spectrum of rural-urban landscape.""","""['Lusine Yaghjyan', 'Christopher R Cogle', 'Guangran Deng', 'Jue Yang', 'Pauline Jackson', 'Nancy Hardt', 'Jaclyn Hall', 'Liang Mao']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Int J Environ Res Public Health""","""['Mapping rural-urban disparities in late-stage cancer with high-resolution rurality index and GWR.', 'Impact of rurality on maternal and infant health indicators and outcomes in Maine.', 'Rurality, Stage-Stratified Use of Treatment Modalities, and Survival of Non-small Cell Lung Cancer.', 'Measuring rurality in health services research: a scoping review.', 'Prostate cancer incidence and mortality in rural men--a systematic review of the literature.', 'Disparities in cancer incidence by rurality in California.', 'Urban and rural differences in new onset type 2 diabetes: Comparisons across national and regional samples in the diabetes LEAD network.', 'Cancer disparities in the context of rurality: risk factors and screening across various U.S. rural classification codes.', 'Categorizing community type for epidemiologic evaluation of community factors and chronic disease across the United States.', 'Integrated Behavioral Health Implementation Patterns in Primary Care Using the Cross-Model Framework: A Latent Class Analysis.']"""

Methods:   A nested case-control study was conducted using the Clalit Health Services database. We formed a population-based cohort of patients who were prescribed their first antihypertensive agent between 2000 and 2014. For each newly diagnosed PCa case in the cohort, 10 controls were matched by age, calendar year of cohort entry, and duration of follow-up. Multivariate conditional logistic regression analyses were used to evaluate the odds ratios (ORs) of PCa among CCB users compared with users of other antihypertensive drugs.  Results:   We identified 4346 patients with newly diagnosed PCa during the median follow-up of 5.3 years. The exposure to CCBs was associated with a slight increase in risk for PCa (OR 1.10, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.02-1.18) when compared with non-CCB antihypertensive drugs. In secondary analyses, evidence was found of a duration-response relationship, with the association for PCa increasing by 27% for every 10-year increment of CCB use (OR 1.27, 95% CI 1.04-1.56).

However, a paucity of publications has looked into its actual efficacy and safety. The aim of our study was to evaluate its ex vivo and in vivo efficiency and to compare its results with other devices presented in the literature.  Patients and methods:   We conducted a prospective pilot study on patients who underwent holmium laser enucleation of the prostate (HoLEP) from 2017 to 2018 using the Top-Down technique. Enucleated adenomas were morcellated using the DrillCutTM morcellator. We collected both preoperative and operative data. Operative data included the enucleated adenoma weight and operative time. Various morcellator parameters were collected including morcellation time and efficiency. We recorded the encountered complications and device malfunction. Ex vivo characteristics were evaluated in terms of morcellation speed and aspiration power.  Results:   Sixty consecutive patients with a median age of 72.8 years were included. The enucleated adenoma was retrieved in 12.5 min (4-58). The median resected prostatic weight was 90 g (44-242). The DrillCutTM efficiency was calculated as 6.46 g/min (2.7-15). Only one patient had a simple bladder mucosal injury. Device malfunction was encountered in 4 patients (6.6%) due to blockage of the morcellator blades. The ex vivo aspiration speed was 52 s/L, while the morcellation power was 14 g/2 min.  Conclusion:   Our results showed that the DrillCut morcellator was effective and safe in managing our patients post-HoLEP. The DrillCutTM has better ex vivo morcellation power but modest aspiration speed in comparison to other morcellators.""","""['Amr Hodhod', 'Fabiola Oquendo', 'Hani Nour', 'Ryan Kelly', 'Walid Shahrour', 'Ahmed Kotb', 'Owen Prowse', 'Hazem Elmansy']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Urol Int""","""['Holmium Laser Enucleation of the Prostate After Prostatic Urethral Lift Surgery: Feasibility and Technical Considerations from a Multi-Institutional Case Series.', 'Morcellation Efficiency in Holmium Laser Enucleation of the Prostate: Oscillating Morcellator Outperforms Reciprocating Morcellator With no Apparent Learning Curve.', 'Ex Vivo Comparison of Efficiency, Safety, and Surgeon Satisfaction in Four Commercial Morcellators.', 'Morcellation After Endoscopic Enucleation of the Prostate: Efficiency and Safety of Currently Available Devices.', 'Current status of holmium laser enucleation of the prostate.']"""

Short term treatment of US men with prostate cancer (PCa) with genistein decreases MMP-2 in prostate tissue. MEK4 regulates MMP-2 expression, drives PCa metastasis, and genistein inhibits MEK4, decreases MMP-2 expression and dietary dosing inhibits human PCa metastasis in mice. This study examines short- versus long-term treatment effects of genistein in humans and in vitro.  Methods and findings:   US men with localized PCa were treated on a phase II trial with genistein (N = 14) versus not (N = 14) for one month prior to radical prostatectomy. Prostate epithelial cells were removed from fresh frozen tissue by laser capture microdissection, and the expression of 12,000 genes profiled. Genistein significantly altered the expression of four genes, three had established links to cancer cell motility and metastasis. Of these three, one was a non-coding transcript, and the other two were BASP1 and HCF2. Genistein increased BASP1 expression in humans, and its engineered over expression and knockdown demonstrated that it suppressed cell invasion in all six human prostate cell lines examined. Genistein decreased HCF2 expression in humans, and it was shown to increase cell invasion in all cell lines examined. The expression of MMP-2, MEK4 and BASP1 was then measured in formalin fixed prostate tissue from N = 38 Chinese men living in China and N = 41 US men living in the US, both cohorts with localized PCa. MMP-2 was 52% higher in Chinese compared to US tissue (P < 0.0001), MEK4 was 48% lower (P < 0.0001), and BASP1 was unaltered. Treatment of PC3 human PCa cells in vitro for up to 8 weeks demonstrated that short term genistein treatment decreased MMP-2, while long term treatment increased it, both changes being significant (P<0.05) compared to untreated control cells. Long term genistein-treated cells retained their responsiveness to genistein's anti-motility effect.  Conclusions:   Genistein inhibits pathways in human prostate that drive transformation to a lethal high motility phenotype. Long term treatment induces compensatory changes in biomarkers of efficacy. The current strategy of using such biomarkers after short term intervention as go/no-go determinants in early phase chemoprevention trials should be carefully examined.""","""['Hu Zhang', 'Ryan Gordon', 'Wenqi Li', 'Ximing Yang', 'Abhinandan Pattanayak', 'Graham Fowler', 'Limin Zhang', 'William J Catalona', 'Yongzeng Ding', 'Li Xu', 'Xiaoke Huang', 'Borko Jovanovic', 'David L Kelly', 'Haowen Jiang', 'Raymond Bergan']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['MEK4 function, genistein treatment, and invasion of human prostate cancer cells.', 'Dietary genistein inhibits metastasis of human prostate cancer in mice.', 'The effects of short-term genistein intervention on prostate biomarker expression in patients with localised prostate cancer before radical prostatectomy.', 'Genistein inhibits human prostate cancer cell detachment, invasion, and metastasis.', 'Prostate cancer: the need for biomarkers and new therapeutic targets.', 'MKK4 Inhibitors-Recent Development Status and Therapeutic Potential.', 'Unravelling the Role of Kinases That Underpin Androgen Signalling in Prostate Cancer.', 'Prostate cancer: Therapeutic prospect with herbal medicine.', 'Genistein: An Integrative Overview of Its Mode of Action, Pharmacological Properties, and Health Benefits.', 'Genistein as a regulator of signaling pathways and microRNAs in different types of cancers.']"""

We retrospectively investigated the association of muscle mass with survival after radical prostatectomy in patients with prostate cancer.  Materials and methods:   We reviewed the records of 2,042 patients who underwent radical prostatectomy of prostate cancer between 1998 and 2013. Muscle mass was evaluated by measuring the psoas muscle index on preoperative computerized tomography images.  Results:   In the lowest, second, third and highest psoas muscle index quartiles the 10-year distant metastasis-free survival rate was 72.5%, 83.8%, 92.3% and 93.7% (p <0.001), the 10-year cancer specific survival rate was 85.7%, 92.1%, 96.8% and 97.6%, and the 10-year overall survival rate was 74.5%, 79.6%, 89.8% and 90.6%, respectively (each p <0.001). The psoas muscle index positively correlated with the body mass index, serum concentrations of IGFBP-3 and bioavailable testosterone, and inversely correlated with patient age, the serum SHBG concentration and the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio. On multivariable analysis the psoas muscle index was independently associated with increased risks of biochemical recurrence, distant metastasis, and cancer specific and overall death.  Conclusions:   Low muscle mass may be associated with increased risks of recurrence and mortality in patients who undergo radical prostatectomy of prostate cancer regardless of the body mass index.

The endogenous PYCR1 expressions in NSCLC cell lines 95C and H1299 were knocked down by lentiviral-mediated delivery of short hairpin RNA (shRNA). Then the effects of PYCR1 on the migration and invasion of NSCLC cells were studied by wound healing assay and transwell assay. Results: PYCR1 mRNA expression was significantly higher in NSCLC specimens than that in normal lung tissues. Depletion of PYCR1 in NSCLC cell significantly repressed the cell migration and invasion. Moreover, depletion of PYCR1 influenced the expression of epithelial-mesenchymal transition molecules E-cadherin, Vimentin, N-cadherin, and Snail1.

We used MTT assay, flow cytometry and western blotting to investigate its molecular mechanisms with focus on reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. Our results showed that glycitein had significant cytotoxic effects on human gastric cancer cells. Glycitein markedly decreased mitochondrial transmembrane potential (ΔΨm) and increased AGS cells mitochondrial-related apoptosis, and caused G0/G1 cell cycle arrest by regulating cycle-related protein. Mechanistically, accompanying ROS, glycitein can activate mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and inhibited the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) and nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-κB) signaling pathways. Furthermore, the MAPK signaling pathway regulated the expression levels of STAT3 and NF-κB upon treatment with MAPK inhibitor and N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC).

Patients and methods:   Quantitative Real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was performed to detect the level of lncRNA ROR in 42 pairs of PCa tissues and adjacent normal tissues, and the correlation between ROR level and PCa pathological parameters was also evaluated. Besides, ROR expression in PCa cells was further verified by qRT-PCR, and ROR knockdown model was constructed using lentivirus in PCa cell lines including PC-3 and Lncap. Cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8), transwell invasion and cell scratch assay were used to analyze the effect of ROR on the biological function of PCa cells and explore its underlying mechanism.  Results:   QRT-PCR results demonstrated that ROR levels in PCa tissues were notably higher than that in normal ones, and the difference was statistically significant. Compared with patients with lowly-expressed ROR, patients with high ROR level had relatively more advanced tumor stage, higher incidence of lymph node or distant metastasis. Similarly, compared with negative control group, the cell proliferation, invasion and metastasis ability of the ROR knockdown group was significantly decreased. In addition, qRT-PCR results indicated that the expression of Akt, the key protein in the Akt signaling pathway, was significantly reduced in si-ROR cell lines. Furthermore, rescue experiment revealed that there was a mutual regulation between ROR and Akt.  Conclusions:   LncRNA ROR expression is strikingly increased in PCa tissues or cells, and is considerably associated with PCa stage, lymph node and distant metastasis.

LncRNA prostate cancer-associated transcript 6 (PCAT6) has been reported to act as an oncogene in several tumors. However, its expression and function in cervical cancer (CC) have not been investigated. In this study, we aim to reveal the functions of PCAT6 and the underlying mechanisms in CC.  Patients and methods:   We evaluated the expression levels of PCAT6 in CC tissues and cell lines using real-time PCR. The clinical data were interpreted by chi-square test, Kaplan-Meier survival analyses, univariate analysis, and multivariate analysis. The effect of PCAT6 on CC proliferation and metastasis was investigated by CCK-8 assay, EdU incorporation assay and transwell assay. The cell apoptosis was detected by apoptosis flow detection. RT-PCR and Western blotting were used to detect the expression levels of β-catenin, cyclin D1 and c-myc.  Results:   We found that PCAT6 expression was significantly up-regulated in human CC tissues and cell lines compared with their normal counterparts, and its high levels were associated with advanced FIGO stage, depth of cervical invasion and positively lymph node metastasis. Survival assays indicated that high PCAT6 expression had a negative influence on overall survival and disease-free survival. Moreover, multivariate analysis identified high PCAT6 expression as an unfavorable prognostic biomarker for CC patients. Functionally, knockdown of PCAT6 significantly suppressed CC cells proliferation, migration and invasion, and promoted apoptosis. Mechanistic investigation showed PCAT6 activates Wnt/β-catenin signaling in CC cell lines by promoting the expression of β-catenin, cyclin D1 and c-myc.

The correlation between TUG1 expression and clinical indexes of PCa patients was analyzed. TUG1 expression in PCa cells and human normal prostate cells was determined by qRT-PCR as well. Overexpression or knockdown of TUG1 was achieved by liposomal transfection. Subsequently, the regulatory effects of TUG1 on the proliferative and migratory capacities of DU145 cells were accessed by Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay, colony formation assay and transwell assay, respectively. An online software was used to predict whether RLIM could be regulated by TUG1, which was further verified by qRT-PCR. After RLIM knockdown in DU145 cells, the proliferative and migratory capacities were also determined. Finally, Western blot was conducted to determine relative protein expressions in the TGF-β1/Smad pathway after altering TUG1 expression in DU145 cells.  Results:   TUG1 was highly expressed in serum samples of PCa patients when compared with healthy subjects and BPH patients. Besides, TUG1 expression in PCa patients with Gleason ≥ 7 was significantly higher than those with Gleason < 7. Meanwhile, TUG1 expression in PCa patients was remarkably higher than that of BPH patients at the PSA grey zone (4-10 ng/mg). ROC curves indicated that TUG1 might be a crucial hallmark to distinguish PCa patients from BPH patients and healthy subjects. The overexpression of TUG1 markedly promoted the proliferative and migratory capacities of DU145 cells. However, knockdown of TUG1 obtained the opposite results. QRT-PCR confirmed that TUG1 was positively correlated with RLIM at the mRNA level. RLIM knockdown significantly inhibited the proliferative and migratory capacities of DU145 cells. Furthermore, knockdown of TUG1 in DU145 cells markedly down-regulated TGF-β1 and p-Smad2, whereas up-regulated p-Smad7.

Uncertainty about the 'best time' to refer has been highlighted as contributing to care variation. Previous work has identified clear disease-specific transition points in the cancer illness which heralded subsequent poor prognosis (less than 6 months) and which, we contest, represent times when palliative care should be routinely introduced as a standardised approach, if not already in place, to maximise patient and carer benefit. This protocol details a trial that will test the feasibility of a novel standardised outpatient model of early palliative care [Standardised Early Palliative Care (STEP Care)] for advanced cancer patients and their family carers, with referrals occurring at the defined disease-specific evidence-based transition points.The aims of this study are to (1) determine the feasibility of conducting a definitive phase 3 randomised trial, which evaluates effectiveness of STEP Care (compared to usual best practice cancer care) for patients with advanced breast or prostate cancer or high grade glioma; (2) examine preliminary efficacy of STEP Care on patient/family caregiver outcomes, including quality of life, mood, symptoms, illness understanding and overall survival; (3) document the impact of STEP Care on quality of end-of-life care; and (4) evaluate the timing of palliative care introduction according to patients, families and health care professionals.  Methods:   Phase 2, multicenter, open-label, parallel-arm, randomised controlled trial (RCT) of STEP Care plus standard best practice cancer care versus standard best practice cancer care alone.  Discussion:   The research will test the feasibility of standardised palliative care introduction based on illness transitions and provide guidance on subsequent development of phase 3 studies of integration. This will directly address the current uncertainty about palliative care timing.

To date, the mechanistic, functional, and clinical significance of FDPS in cancer remains unexplored. We evaluated the FDPS expression and its cancer-associated phenotypes using in vitro and in vivo methods in PTEN-deficient and sufficient human and mouse PCa cells and tumors. Interestingly, FDPS overexpression synergizes with PTEN deficiency in PTEN conditionally knockout mice (P < 0.05) and expressed significantly higher in human (P < 0.001) PCa tissues, cell lines, and murine tumoroids compared to respective controls. In silico analysis revealed that FDPS is associated with increasing Gleason score, PTEN functionally deficient status, and poor survival of PCa. Ectopic overexpression of FDPS promotes oncogenic phenotypes such as colony formation (P < 0.01) and proliferation (P < 0.01) through activation of AKT and ERK signaling by prenylating Rho A, Rho G, and CDC42 small GTPases. Of interest, knockdown of FDPS in PCa cells exhibits decreased colony growth and proliferation (P < 0.001) by modulating AKT and ERK pathways. Further, genetic and pharmacological inhibition of PI3K but not AKT reduced FDPS expression. Pharmacological targeting of FDPS by zoledronic acid (ZOL), which is already in clinics, exhibit reduced growth and clonogenicity of human and murine PCa cells (P < 0.01) and 3D tumoroids (P < 0.02) by disrupting AKT and ERK signaling through direct interference of small GTPases protein prenylation.

Fresh or formalin fixed specimens were stained in 2.5 min with fluorescent nuclear and stromal dyes. Nonlinear microscopy images of unsectioned tissues were generated by nonlinear (two-photon) excitation of the fluorophores, where fluorescence is only emitted from tissue at the microscope focus, avoiding the need for physical sectioning. The images were displayed in real time using a color scale similar to H&E, then tissues were processed for standard paraffin embedded H&E histology. Seventy nonlinear microscopy and corresponding paraffin H&E images of fresh and fixed prostate specimens (15 cancer, 55 benign) from 24 patients were read by genitourinary pathologists to assess if nonlinear microscopy could achieve an equivalent evaluation to paraffin embedded H&E histology. Differences between nonlinear microscopy images and paraffin H&E slides, including cytoplasmic color and stromal density, were observed, however nonlinear microscopy images could be interpreted with minimal training. Nonlinear microscopy enabled visualization of benign, atrophic and hyperplastic glands and stroma, ejaculatory ducts, vasculature and inflammatory changes. Nonlinear microscopy enabled identification of typical and variants of adenocarcinoma, as well as Gleason patterns. Perineural invasion and extraprostatic extension could also be assessed. Nonlinear microscopy images closely resemble paraffin H&E slides and enable rapid assessment of normal prostate architecture, benign conditions, and carcinoma in freshly excised and fixed specimens.

Transcriptome analysis revealed that LXN overexpression had no direct effects on gene expression but had significant indirect effects on important genes involved in both retinoid metabolism and IFN-associated inflammatory responses.

SNPs are known to play an important role in developing prostate cancer. The impact of PVT1 and its neighborhood genes (CASC11 and MYC) on prostate cancer risk are getting more attention recently. The interactions among these three genes associated with prostate cancer risk are understudied, especially for AA men. The objective of this study is to investigate SNP-SNP interactions in the CASC11-MYC-PVT1 region associated with prostate cancer risk in AA men.  Methods:   We evaluated 205 SNPs using the 2,253 prostate cancer patients and 2,423 controls and applied multiphase (discovery-validation) design. In addition to SNP individual effects, SNP-SNP interactions were evaluated using the SNP Interaction Pattern Identifier, which assesses 45 patterns.  Results:   Three SNPs (rs9642880, rs16902359, and rs12680047) and 79 SNP-SNP pairs were significantly associated with prostate cancer risk. These two SNPs (rs16902359 and rs9642880) in CASC11 interacted frequently with other SNPs with 56 and 9 pairs, respectively. We identified the novel interaction of CASC11-PVT1, which is the most common gene interaction (70%) in the top 79 pairs. Several top SNP interactions have a moderate to large effect size (OR, 0.27-0.68) and have a higher prediction power to prostate cancer risk than SNP individual effects.  Conclusions:   Novel SNP-SNP interactions in the CASC11-MYC-PVT1 region have a larger impact than SNP individual effects on prostate cancer risk in AA men.  Impact:   This gene-gene interaction between CASC11 and PVT1 can provide valuable information to reveal potential biological mechanisms of prostate cancer development.""","""['Hui-Yi Lin', 'Catherine Y Callan', 'Zhide Fang', 'Heng-Yuan Tung', 'Jong Y Park']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev""","""['Prostate cancer risk associated loci in African Americans.', 'Genetic polymorphism and prostate cancer aggressiveness: a case-only study of 1,536 GWAS and candidate SNPs in African-Americans and European-Americans.', 'Contribution of lncRNA CASC8, CASC11, and PVT1 Genetic Variants to the Susceptibility of Coronary Heart Disease.', 'Prostate Cancer in African American Men: The Effect of Androgens and microRNAs on Epidermal Growth Factor Signaling.', 'Health inequity drives disease biology to create disparities in prostate cancer outcomes.', 'Regulation mechanism and pathogenic role of lncRNA plasmacytoma variant translocation 1 (PVT1) in human diseases.', 'N6‑methyladenosine‑induced long non‑coding RNA PVT1 regulates the miR‑27b‑3p/BLM axis to promote prostate cancer progression.', 'Critical roles of the lncRNA CASC11 in tumor progression and cancer metastasis: The biomarker and therapeutic target potential.', '8q24.21 Locus: A Paradigm to Link Non-Coding RNAs, Genome Polymorphisms and Cancer.', 'Genomic and Functional Regulation of TRIB1 Contributes to Prostate Cancer Pathogenesis.']"""

Methods:   We performed a retrospective analysis of 6471 men, 50-75 years old with prostate-specific antigen between 2.5 and 10 ng/ml and prior negative biopsy who were enrolled in the Reduction by Dutasteride of PCa Events trial and underwent a 2-year repeat biopsy. The association between baseline BCH and risk of PCa, BPH/LUTS and clinical prostatitis measured at baseline were evaluated with logistic regression in uni/multivariable analysis, controlling for baseline patient characteristics.  Results:   Among 6471 men enrolled, 84 (1.3%) had BCH in the baseline prostate biopsy. BCH was associated less chronic inflammation and more prostate atrophy (P < 0.05) and was unrelated to baseline patient characteristics. In both uni/multivariable analyses, BCH was not associated with PCa in repeat biopsy (univariable odds ratio [OR] = 0.98, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.53-1.82, P > 0.05; multivariable OR=1.15, 95% CI = 0.61-2.16, P > 0.05), BPH/LUTS (univariable OR = 1.13, 95% CI = 0.71-1.81, P > 0.05; multivariable OR = 1.20, 95% CI = 0.74-1.94, P > 0.05), or clinical prostatitis (univariable OR = 0.56, 95% CI = 0.18-1.81, P > 0.05; multivariable OR = 0.57, 95% CI = 0.18-1.83, P > 0.05).

Methods: This retrospective study identified a group of patients with newly-developed mCRPC from 2012 to 2016 to extract information from their medical and billing records in two tertiary care hospitals. Descriptive statistical methods were used to summarize patient clinical characteristics, treatment pattern, and monthly medical costs. Conventional regression analyses explored the predictors for the utilization of chemotherapy and monthly medical costs. Results: Seventy-eight identified mCRPC patients were characterized with a high proportion of stage IV tumors at diagnosis of prostate cancer (75.0%) and high prevalence of bone metastasis (91.0%). Sixty-six percent of the identified patients only received one treatment episode. Among the patients receiving the first treatment episode, hormone therapy, chemotherapy, and best supportive care (BSC) accounted for 75.7%, 21.4%, and 2.9%, respectively; the previous orchiectomy was significantly associated with chemotherapy (odds ratio = 5.325, p = 0.034); and chemotherapy was associated with comparable drug costs and higher non-drug costs (coefficient = 0.657, p = 0.056) when compared to hormone therapy after the adjustment of patient characteristics. Conclusions: Chinese mCRPC patients were characterized with delayed diagnosis of prostate cancer and high prevalence of bone metastasis. The treatment options for mCRPC were limited in Chinese patients as the conventional hormone therapy was still heavily used after the development of mCRPC. The medical costs associated with mCRPC were mainly driven by chemotherapy in Chinese patients.""","""['Zhaoxin Qian', 'Yinhuai Wang', 'Zhengyan Tang', 'Da Ren', 'Zhao Wang', 'Wendong Chen', 'Zhihong Li']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""J Med Econ""","""['Anticancer Activity and Tolerance of Treatments Received Beyond Progression in Men Treated Upfront with Androgen Deprivation Therapy With or Without Docetaxel for Metastatic Castration-naïve Prostate Cancer in the GETUG-AFU 15 Phase 3 Trial.', 'Optimal sequencing of docetaxel and abiraterone in men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Abiraterone acetate plus prednisone for the Management of Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer (mCRPC) without prior use of chemotherapy: report from a large, international, real-world retrospective cohort study.', 'Docetaxel Activity in the Era of Life-prolonging Hormonal Therapies for Metastatic Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Navigating Treatment of Metastatic Castration- Resistant Prostate Cancer: Nursing Perspectives.', 'The cost impact of disease progression to metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer.', 'Radium-223 in Asian patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer with symptomatic bone metastases: A single-arm phase 3 study.', 'Health Care Utilization and Costs of Patients With Prostate Cancer in China Based on National Health Insurance Database From 2015 to 2017.']"""
