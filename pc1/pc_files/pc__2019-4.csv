Therefore, the present study assessed assumptions about subjective causes of cancer and examines their relationships with social factors and perceived stigmatization.  Methods:   In a bicentric study, 858 patients with breast, colon, prostate or lung cancer were given standardized questionnaires. Of these, n=815 were included in the analyses. Causal attributions were assessed using a set of 17 items including main causes of cancer. Stigmatization was assessed with the Social Impact Scale (SIS-D). The data are evaluated uni-and multivariable.  Results:   The mean age is 60 years, 54% are male. The majority of the patients (95%) state multiple causes of their disease. Environment is considered to be the most important influencing factor (M=3.0) by all cancer sites. The lowest influence is attributed to guilt/god's punishment (M=1.1). Causal attributions which are due to the lifestyle factors showed no higher correlations with stigmatizing attitudes than external attributions (r=0.07-0.38). Psychosocial factors (Beta=- 0.051 bis -0.086), smoking (Beta=- 0.087) and guilt/god's punishment (Beta=- 0.023) have been stated lowest in patients with high income. The lower the education of the patient the higher rated is the influence of contagion (Beta=- 0.019).  Conclusion:   Actual cancer risks are only partially taken into account as disease causes (e. g. nutrition), while others are underestimated (e. g. alcohol). Future cancer education interventions should focus on low-educated patients.""","""['Julia Roick', 'Peter Esser', 'Beate Hornemann', 'Anja Mehnert', 'Jochen Ernst']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Psychother Psychosom Med Psychol""","""['Perceived stigmatization and its impact on quality of life - results from a large register-based study including breast, colon, prostate and lung cancer patients.', 'Stigmatization in Employed Patients with Breast, Intestinal, Prostate and Lung Cancer.', '""Why me?"" - women\'s use of spiritual causal attributions in making sense of breast cancer.', 'What causes breast cancer?

Among them, orally administrative, cancer-selective, and side effect-free photosensitizers (PSs) that can be activated by tissue-penetrative near-infrared (NIR) lights are strongly demanded. We discovered such a PS from scratch by focusing on a twist-assisted spin-orbit charge transfer intersystem crossing (ISC) mechanism in a biphenyl derivative, which was demonstrated by thorough photophysical studies. The unique ISC mechanism enables the PS to be small and slim so as to pass through glucose transporters and exert a PDT effect selectively on a cancer cell line. The smallness will allow for oral administration and fast clearance, which have been agenda of approved PSs with larger molecular weights.

Growing evidence suggests that deregulation of miRNA expression levels underlies chemo‑resistance. To investigate whether miRNA‑302a (miR‑302a) is involved in mediating chemo‑resistance to paclitaxel in prostate cancer, a series of in vitro analyses were performed in paclitaxel‑resistant prostate cancer PC‑3PR cells and non‑resistant prostate cancer PC‑3 cells. It was demonstrated that the expression of miR‑302a was upregulated in PC‑3PR cells. Notably, ectopic expression of miR‑302a also increased resistance to paclitaxel in wild‑type PC‑3 cells. By contrast, silencing of miR‑302a in PC‑3PR cells sensitized the cells to paclitaxel. Gene and protein expression analyses suggested that the miR‑302a target gene breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) may mediate chemo‑resistance to paclitaxel in PC‑3PR cells. In conclusion, the data suggested that elevated miR‑302a levels, in part, mediate sensitivity to paclitaxel in prostate cancer through the aberrant regulation of its downstream targets, AOF2, BCRP and permeability glycoprotein 1. These data have implications for the development of novel therapeutics in prostate cancer that may improve sensitivity to chemotherapeutics.""","""['Yuqi Wu', 'Li Hu', 'Zizhen Qin', 'Xiangwei Wang']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Mol Med Rep""","""['Long non-coding RNA FTH1P3 activates paclitaxel resistance in breast cancer through miR-206/ABCB1.', 'MicroRNA-34a Attenuates Paclitaxel Resistance in Prostate Cancer Cells via Direct Suppression of JAG1/Notch1 Axis.', 'ETS1 promotes chemoresistance and invasion of paclitaxel-resistant, hormone-refractory PC3 prostate cancer cells by up-regulating MDR1 and MMP9 expression.', 'MicroRNA‑302a inhibits cell proliferation and invasion, and induces cell apoptosis in hepatocellular carcinoma by directly targeting VEGFA.', 'An update on expression and function of P-gp/ABCB1 and BCRP/ABCG2 in the placenta and fetus.', 'miRNA-877-5p inhibits malignant progression of prostate cancer by directly targeting SSFA2.', 'Long non-coding RNA CRNDE regulates the growth and migration of prostate cancer cells by targeting microRNA-146a-5p.']"""

The aim of current study is to investigate the role of lncRNA-urothelial carcinoma associated 1 (UCA1) in the progression of PCa. We evaluated the expression levels of UCA1 in a total of 16 benign prostatic hyperplasia tissues (BPH) and 40 PCa tissues, as well as PCa cells. The functional regulatory effects of UCA1 were investigated using a series of cell function approaches. Our data showed that UCA1 is frequently overexpressed in PCa tissues compared with BPH tissues (P<0.01). Moreover, the higher expression of UCA1 was observed in patients with Gleason score ≥8 (P<0.05). In consistent, we found the expression levels of UCA1 was higher in the PCa cell lines PC-3, LnCaP, and DU-145 than in the normal prostate epithelial cell line RWPE-1 (P<0.01). Functionally, we found knockdown of UCA1 in PC-3 significantly suppressed cell growth and invasion of PC-3, while overexpression of UCA1 in DU-145 cells promote cell growth and invasion. Mechanistically, UCA1 overexpression permitted activation of CXCR4 oncogenes through inhibition of miR-204 activity, as evidenced by the positive association of these two genes with UCA1 levels and inverse correlation with miR-204 expression in PCa tissues. Luciferase activity assay further confirmed the targetting relationship between UCA1 and miR-204, CXCR4, and miR-204.

The androgen receptor (AR) antagonist enzalutamide is a Food and Drug Administration-approved drug for treatment of patients with late-stage prostate cancer and is currently under clinical study for early-stage prostate cancer treatment. After a short positive response period, tumors will develop drug resistance. In this study using RNA-Seq and bioinformatics analyses, we observed that NOTCH signaling is a deregulated pathway in enzalutamide-resistant cells. NOTCH2 and c-MYC gene expression positively correlated with AR expression in samples from patient with hormone refractory disease in which AR expression levels correspond to those typically observed in enzalutamide resistance. Cleaved NOTCH1, HES1 (Hes family BHLH transcription factor 1), and c-MYC protein expression levels are elevated in two enzalutamide-resistant cell lines, MR49F and C4-2R, indicating NOTCH signaling activation. Moreover, inhibition of the overexpressed ADAM metallopeptidase domain 10 (ADAM10) in the resistant cells induces an exclusive reduction in cleaved NOTCH1 expression. Furthermore, exposure of enzalutamide-resistant cells to both PF-03084014 and enzalutamide increased cell death, decreased colony formation ability, and resensitized cells to enzalutamide. Knockdown of NOTCH1 in C4-2R increased enzalutamide sensitivity by decreasing cell proliferation and increasing cleaved PARP expression. In a 22RV1 xenograft model, PF-03084014 and enzalutamide decreased tumor growth through reducing cell proliferation and increasing apoptosis. These results indicate that NOTCH1 signaling may contribute to enzalutamide resistance in prostate cancer, and inhibition of NOTCH signaling can resensitize resistant cells to enzalutamide.""","""['Elia Farah', 'Chaohao Li', 'Lijun Cheng', 'Yifan Kong', 'Nadia A Lanman', 'Pete Pascuzzi', 'Gabrielle Renee Lorenz', 'Yanquan Zhang', 'Nihal Ahmad', 'Lang Li', 'Tim Ratliff', 'Xiaoqi Liu']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""J Biol Chem""","""['Targeting CPT1B as a potential therapeutic strategy in castration-resistant and enzalutamide-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Moving Towards Precision Urologic Oncology: Targeting Enzalutamide-resistant Prostate Cancer and Mutated Forms of the Androgen Receptor Using the Novel Inhibitor Darolutamide (ODM-201).', 'HepaCAM inhibits the malignant behavior of castration-resistant prostate cancer cells by downregulating Notch signaling and PF-3084014 (a γ-secretase inhibitor) partly reverses the resistance of refractory prostate cancer to docetaxel and enzalutamide in vitro.', 'Moving Breast Cancer Therapy up a Notch.', 'Enzalutamide: a new agent for the prostate cancer treatment armamentarium.', 'Cucurbitacin-B instigates intrinsic apoptosis and modulates Notch signaling in androgen-dependent prostate cancer LNCaP cells.', 'The Molecular Biology of Prostate Cancer Stem Cells: From the Past to the Future.', 'A kinome-wide CRISPR screen identifies CK1α as a target to overcome enzalutamide resistance of prostate cancer.', 'In vitro effects of gamma-secretase inhibition in HPV-positive and HPV-negative head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.', 'Exploration of the Use of Natural Compounds in Combination with Chemotherapy Drugs for Tumor Treatment.']"""

However, the extent to which mpMRI has been implemented in active surveillance has not been established.  Methods:   Using Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results registry data linked to Medicare claims data, we identified men with localized prostate cancer diagnosed between 2008 and 2013 and managed with active surveillance. We classified men into 2 treatment groups: active surveillance without mpMRI and active surveillance with mpMRI. We then fit a multivariable logistic regression models to examine changing mpMRI utilization over time, and factors associated with the receipt of mpMRI.  Results:   We identified 9467 men on active surveillance. Of these, 8178 (86%) did not receive mpMRI and 1289 (14%) received mpMRI. The likelihood of receiving mpMRI over the entire study period increased by 3.7% (P = .004). On multivariable logistic regression, patients who were younger, white, had lower comorbidity burden, lived in the northeast and west, had higher incomes and lived in more urban areas had greater odds of receiving mpMRI (all P < .05).  Conclusion:   From 2008 to 2013, use of mpMRI in active surveillance increased gradually but significantly. Receipt of mpMRI among men on surveillance for prostate cancer varied significantly across demographic, geographic, and socioeconomic strata. Going forward, studies should investigate causes for this variation and define ideal strategies for equitable, cost-effective dissemination of mpMRI technology.""","""['Mina M Fam', 'Jonathan G Yabes', 'Liam C Macleod', 'Jathin Bandari', 'Robert M Turner nd', 'Samia H Lopa', 'Alessandro Furlan', 'Christopher P Filson', 'Benjamin J Davies', 'Bruce L Jacobs']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Urology""","""['Editorial Comment.', 'Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging Is Associated with Increased Medicare Spending in Prostate Cancer Active Surveillance.', 'Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging Alone is Insufficient to Detect Grade Reclassification in Active Surveillance for Prostate Cancer.', 'Utility of multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging in the risk stratification of men with Grade Group 1 prostate cancer on active surveillance.', 'The role of multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging in the selection and follow-up of patients undergoing active surveillance for prostate cancer.

The Vascular, Extracellular, and Restricted Diffusion for Cytometry in Tumors (VERDICT) model estimates three distinct signal components and associates them to (a) intracellular water, (b) water in the extracellular extravascular space, and (c) water in the microvasculature. Purpose To evaluate the repeatability, image quality, and diagnostic utility of intracellular volume fraction (FIC) maps obtained with VERDICT prostate MRI and to compare those maps with apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps for Gleason grade differentiation. Materials and Methods Seventy men (median age, 62.2 years; range, 49.5-82.0 years) suspected of having prostate cancer or undergoing active surveillance were recruited to a prospective study between April 2016 and October 2017. All men underwent multiparametric prostate and VERDICT MRI. Forty-two of the 70 men (median age, 67.7 years; range, 50.0-82.0 years) underwent two VERDICT MRI acquisitions to assess repeatability of FIC measurements obtained with VERDICT MRI. Repeatability was measured with use of intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs). The image quality of FIC and ADC maps was independently evaluated by two board-certified radiologists. Forty-two men (median age, 64.8 years; range, 49.5-79.6 years) underwent targeted biopsy, which enabled comparison of FIC and ADC metrics in the differentiation between Gleason grades. Results VERDICT MRI FIC demonstrated ICCs of 0.87-0.95. There was no significant difference between image quality of ADC and FIC maps (score, 3.1 vs 3.3, respectively; P = .90). FIC was higher in lesions with a Gleason grade of at least 3+4 compared with benign and/or Gleason grade 3+3 lesions (mean, 0.49 ± 0.17 vs 0.31 ± 0.12, respectively; P = .002). The difference in ADC between these groups did not reach statistical significance (mean, 1.42 vs 1.16 × 10-3 mm2/sec; P = .26). Conclusion Fractional intracellular volume demonstrates high repeatability and image quality and enables better differentiation of a Gleason 4 component cancer from benign and/or Gleason 3+3 histology than apparent diffusion coefficient.

Then, GO enrichment analysis was performed to identify the significant functions and pathways of overlapping modules in the Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) database. More than 75% of these overlapping genes were found to be consistent with the findings of previous studies. In the three diseases, we found that Sarcoglycan delta (SGCD) and Rho family GTPase 3 (RND3) were the overlapping genes and identified negative regulation of apoptotic process and negative regulation of transcription from RNA polymerase II promoter RNA as the two overlapping biological functions. CML and PCa were the most closely related, with 34 overlapping genes, five overlapping modules, 27 overlapping biological functions, and nine overlapping pathways. There were 13 overlapping genes, one overlapping modules, four overlapping biological functions and one overlapping pathway (FoxO signaling pathway) were found in T2DM and CML.And T2DM and PCa were the least related pair in our study, with only six overlapping genes, five overlapping modules, and one overlapping biological function. SGCD and RND3 were the main gene-to-gene relationship among T2DM, CML, and PCa; apoptosis, development, and transcription from RNA polymerase II promote processes were the main functional connections among T2DM, CML, and PCa by network enrichment analysis. There is a ""scalene"" relationship among T2DM, CML, and PCa at gene, pathway, biological process, and module levels: CML and PCa were the most closely related, the second were T2DM and PCa, and T2DM and PCa were the least related pair in our study.

In our previous study, we revealed that miR-204 overexpression could sensitize CRC cell to 5-FU treatment through targeting HMGA2/PI3K signaling pathway; however, miR-204 expression in CRC tissues is abnormally downregulated. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) dysregulation has been reported in human diseases, including cancer. Also, lncRNA can regulate cancer cell proliferation, invasion, migration, as well as chemoresistance. LncRNA prostate cancer-associated transcript 6 (PCAT6) acts as an oncogene in many cancers; herein, PCAT6 expression was abnormally upregulated in CRC tissues and cell lines, suggesting its potential role in CRC. Further, we assessed the specific function and mechanism of PCAT6 in CRC. Furthermore, we revealed that PCAT6 knockdown attenuated CRC chemoresistance to 5-FU through miR-204/HMGA2/PI3K; miR-204 inhibition could partially reverse the effect of PCAT6 knockdown. Taken together, we demonstrate that the abnormal PCAT6 overexpression inhibits miR-204 expression in CRC, thereby promoting HMGA2/PI3K signaling activity, ultimately enhancing the chemoresistance of CRC cells to 5-FU; PCAT6 represents a promising target for dealing with CRC chemoresistance.""","""['Haijun Wu', 'Qiongyan Zou', 'Hong He', 'Yu Liang', 'Mingjun Lei', 'Qin Zhou', 'Dan Fan', 'Liangfang Shen']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Cancer Med""","""['Upregulation of microRNA-135b and microRNA-182 promotes chemoresistance of colorectal cancer by targeting ST6GALNAC2 via PI3K/AKT pathway.', 'The lncRNA CRNDE promotes colorectal cancer cell proliferation and chemoresistance via miR-181a-5p-mediated regulation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling.', 'The long non-coding RNA ENST00000547547 reduces 5-fluorouracil resistance of colorectal cancer cells via competitive binding to microRNA-31.', 'A review on the role of PCAT6 lncRNA in tumorigenesis.', 'The emerging role of noncoding RNAs in colorectal cancer chemoresistance.', 'Identification of non-coding RNA related prognosis biomarkers based on ceRNA network in thyroid cancer.', 'Aberrant HMGA2 Expression Sustains Genome Instability That Promotes Metastasis and Therapeutic Resistance in Colorectal Cancer.', 'Regulatory Roles of Noncoding RNAs in the Progression of Gastrointestinal Cancers and Health Disparities.', 'Molecular Landscape of LncRNAs in Prostate Cancer: A focus on pathways and therapeutic targets for intervention.', 'Construction and validation of four-metabolism related-long non-coding RNAs as potential signature in prognosis of colon cancer.']"""

In the present study, we examined changes in proliferation, colony formation, and migration after phloretin treatment in human prostate cancer cells PC3 and DU145. We measured reactive oxygen species (ROS) and gene expression. Phloretin increased ROS and suppressed cell proliferation, migration, and colony formation in both cell lines. Additionally, phloretin treatment increased oxidative stress, as demonstrated through lower antioxidant enzymes (catalase, SOD2, Gpx1, Gpx3). In addition, their regulator CISD2 decreased in expression. We also found that increased ROS significantly downregulated multiple components of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway (β-catenin, TCF4, FoxA2, c-Myc) and Twist1. Thus, anticancer activity of phloretin against human prostate cancer cells occurs through generating ROS to influence Wnt/β-catenin signaling. The results of this study suggest that phloretin has a therapeutic effect on prostate cancer in vitro, inhibiting the proliferation and migration of cancer cell lines PC3 and DU145.

Logistic regressions were used for functional outcome. Urinary continence (UC) was defined as the use of 0 or 1 safety pad/day and potency as an IIEF-5 score of ≥ 18.  Results:   Compared to their older counterparts, patients ≤ 45 years had more favorable tumor characteristics. Of all patients aged ≤ 45 years, 89% underwent bilateral and 9.3% unilateral nerve-sparing procedure. Five year BCR-free survival and MFS were 80.2% and 98.7% for patients ≤ 45 years, 72.8% and 95.0% for patients > 45 and ≤ 65 years and 70.5% and 94.9% for patients > 65 years. For the same groups, 1-year UC-rates were 97.4%, 89.4%, and 84.7% while 1.3%, 8.2%, and 11.6% used 1-2 pads/24 h. At 1-year, 75.6%, 58.6%, and 45.3% of preoperatively potent patients who underwent bilateral nerve-sparing were considered potent. Younger age was an independent predictor of favorable functional outcome also in multivariable analysis.  Conclusions:   Patients aged ≤ 45 years had more favorable tumor characteristics and oncological outcomes. Moreover, younger patients should be counseled about the excellent postoperative continence and potency rates.""","""['Derya Tilki', 'Valentin Maurer', 'Raisa S Pompe', 'Felix K Chun', 'Felix Preisser', 'Alexander Haese', 'Markus Graefen', 'Hartwig Huland', 'Philipp Mandel']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""World J Urol""","""['Long-term evaluation of survival, continence and potency (SCP) outcomes after robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP).', 'Functional and oncological outcomes of patients aged <50 years treated with radical prostatectomy for localised prostate cancer in a European population.', 'Introducing a new, simple scoring system to evaluate oncological and functional outcome after radical prostatectomy.', 'A Critical Analysis of the Current Knowledge of Surgical Anatomy of the Prostate Related to Optimisation of Cancer Control and Preservation of Continence and Erection in Candidates for Radical Prostatectomy: An Update.', 'Systematic review of methods for reporting combined outcomes after radical prostatectomy and proposal of a novel system: the survival, continence, and potency (SCP) classification.', 'The Effect of Adverse Patient Characteristics on Perioperative Outcomes in Open and Robot-Assisted Radical Prostatectomy.', 'Clinicopathological characteristics of localized prostate cancer in younger men aged\xa0≤\xa050\xa0years treated with radical prostatectomy in the PSA era: A systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Very Early Continence After Radical Prostatectomy and Its Influencing Factors.']"""

The inhibitory effect of N-myc downstream-regulated gene 2 (NDRG2) on the invasiveness properties of PCa cells has been demonstrated previously. However, its underlying mechanisms have not yet been investigated. The present study aimed to investigate the effects of NDRG2 overexpression on the expression of genes involved in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) including E-cadherin (E-CAD), α- and β-catenins, Slug and Snail, transforming growth factor (TGF)-α and -β, and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF).  Methods:   In the present in vitro study, LNCaP cells were divided into three groups, namely NDRG2 group (transfected with PSES-pAdenoVator-PSA-NDRG2-IRES-GFP plasmid), mock group (transfected with mock plasmid), and control group (without transfection). The effect of NDRG2 overexpression on the migration and invasion of LNCaP cells were investigated using the transwell assay. Real-time PCR was used for the evaluation of gene expression. For the statistical analyses, one-way ANOVA, student t test or Mann-Whitney U test were applied using the SPSS software (version 15.0). P values <0.05 were considered statistically significant.  Results:   The results demonstrated that the overexpression of NDRG2 reduced the invasion and migration of LNCaP cells compared to the control and mock groups (P<0.001). A decreased expression of TGF-β (P=0.002), VEGF (P=0.014), Slug (P=0.005), and Snail (P=0.012); and an increased expression of E-CAD (P=0.009) were observed following NDRG2 overexpression in LNCaP cells.

Here, we describe a self-assembled, compact (~30 nm) and biocompatible ribonucleoprotein-octamer nanoparticle that achieves endosomal destabilization and targeted delivery. The protein octamer consists of a poly(ethylene glycol) scaffold, a sterically masked endosomolytic peptide and a double-stranded RNA-binding domain, providing a discrete number of siRNA loading sites and a high siRNA payload (>30 wt%), and offering flexibility in both siRNA and targeting-ligand selection.

However patients with hip prostheses have been excluded from all MR-only research to date and assumed to require dedicated sCT algorithms. This study aimed to investigate the dosimetric accuracy of applying a commercial sCT algorithm, based on an atlas of patients without hip prostheses, to patients with prostheses.  Materials and methods:   18 patients with unilateral hip prostheses received MR and CT scans in the radiotherapy position. sCTs were generated from the MR using a commercial algorithm. The clinical Volumetric Modulated Arc Therapy (VMAT) plan, consisting of partial arcs which avoided the prosthesis, was recalculated using the sCT and the dose distribution compared.  Results:   The mean isocentre dose difference was ΔD = (-0.4 ± 0.2)% (mean ± standard error of the mean (sem), range - 1.9%, 1.1%) and the mean differences in Planning Target Volume, bladder and rectum mean doses were ≤0.3%. The 3D global gamma pass rate with dose difference 1% and distance to agreement 1 mm within the body was ΓBody1/1 = (95.0 ± 0.5)% (sem) and within the 50% isodose volume, which excluded the prosthesis, was Γ50%1/1 = (98.5 ± 0.4)% (sem). The pass rate within the PTV was ΓPTV2/2 ≥ 99.7% for all patients, although for PTVs close (≤3.5 cm) to the prosthesis ΓPTV1/1 < 85% for three patients. The sCT did not accurately represent the prosthesis with a mean difference in radiological isocentre depth near the prosthesis of ΔdOutsideRad = (15.8 ± 2.6) mm (sem). However inside the treatment plan arc the difference was ΔdInsideRad = (-1.8 ± 0.5) mm (sem).  Conclusions:   Using a commercial prostate sCT algorithm for patients with unilateral hip prostheses is dosimetrically accurate (<0.5%) as long as the routine prosthesis-avoidance treatment planning approach is used and the PTV is >3.5 cm from the prosthesis.

Herein, we analyzed the efficacy and therapeutic potential of our developed histone lysine demethylase 1 (LSD1) inhibitor, NCL1, in castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). The CRPC cell lines 22Rv1, PC3, and PCai1CS were treated with NCL1, and LSD1 expression and cell viability were assessed. The epigenetic effects and mechanisms of NCL1 were also evaluated. CRPC cells showed strong LSD1 expression, and cell viability was decreased by NCL1 in a dose-dependent manner. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis indicated that NCL1 induced histone H3 lysine 9 dimethylation accumulation at promoters of P21. As shown by Western blot and flow cytometry analyses, NCL1 also dose-dependently induced caspase-dependent apoptosis. The stimulation of autophagy was observed in NCL1-treated 22Rv1 cells by transmission electron microscopy and LysoTracker analysis. Furthermore, WST-8 assay revealed that the anti-tumor effect of NCL1 was reinforced when autophagy was inhibited by chloroquine in 22Rv1 cells. Combination index analysis revealed that a concurrent use of these drugs had a synergistic effect. In ex vivo analysis, castrated nude mice were injected subcutaneously with PCai1 cells and intraperitoneally with NCL1. Tumor volume was found to be reduced with no adverse effects in NCL1-treated mice compared with controls. Finally, immunohistochemical analysis using consecutive human specimens in pre- and post-androgen deprivation therapy demonstrated that LSD1 expression levels in CRPC, including neuroendocrine differentiation cases, were very high, and identical to levels observed in previously examined prostate biopsy specimens.

As little to no biochemical markers for prostate tissue exist, we explored the possibilities of tissue N-glycosylation and near-infrared spectroscopy (NIR) in PCa diagnosis.  Methods:   Tissue specimens from 100 patients (benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH), n = 50; and PCa, n = 50) were obtained. The fresh-frozen tissue was dispersed and a tissue N-glycosylation profile was determined. Consequently, the formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded slides were analyzed using NIR spectroscopy. A comparison was made between the benign and malignant tissue, and between the various Gleason scores.  Results:   A difference was observed for the tissue of N-glycosylation between the benign and malignant tissue. These differences were located in the fycosylation ratios and the total amount of bi- and tetra-antennary structures (all p < 0.0001). These differences were also present between various Gleason scores. In addition, the NIR spectra revealed changes between the benign and malignant tissue in several regions. Moreover, spectral ranges of 1055⁻1065 nm and 1450⁻1460 nm were significantly different between the Gleason scores (p = 0.0042 and p = 0.0195).  Conclusions:   We have demonstrated biochemical changes in the N-glycan profile of prostate tissue, which allows for the distinction between malignant and benign tissue, as well as between various Gleason scores. These changes can be correlated to the changes observed in the NIR spectra.

Although radiosensitization mechanisms are known to be mediated through androgen receptor activity, this project aims to uncover the detailed DNA damage repair factors influenced by enzalutamide using multiple models of androgen-sensitive (LNCaP) and castration-resistant human prostate cancer (22Rv1 and DU145). Enzalutamide is able to radiosensitize both androgen-dependent and androgen-independent human prostate cancer models in cell culture and xenografts in mice, as well as a treatment-resistant patient-derived xenograft. The enzalutamide-mediated mechanism of radiosensitization includes delay of DNA repair through temporal prolongation of the repair factor complexes and halting the cell cycle, which results in decreased colony survival.

The recent definition of TTC as the time at which the probability of belonging to the cured group reaches 95% was used for the first time.  Methods:   The data stem from the common database of French cancer registries including 335,358 solid tumours diagnosed between 1995 and 2009 at 27 sites. P and TTC were estimated through a flexible parametric net survival cure model for each cancer site, sex, and age at diagnosis with acceptable assumption of cure (excess mortality rate ≤0.05).  Results:   TTC was ≤5 years and P was >80% for skin melanoma and thyroid and testis cancers. It was 0 for testis cancer in men <55 and for thyroid cancer in men <45 and women <65. TTC was between 5 and 10 years for all digestive cancers except small intestine and all gynaecologic cancers except breast. It was ≥10 years in prostate, breast, and urinary tract. The range of P according to age and sex was 37-79% for urinary tract 72-88% for prostate and breast, 4-16% for pancreatic and 47-62% for colorectal cancer.  Conclusion:   Time-to-cure was estimated for the first time from a large national database and individual probabilities of cure.

The purpose of this study is to investigate the impact of direct MRI-guided biopsy of the prostate on clinical management in practice. MATERIALS AND METHODS. We retrospectively identified 127 patients with unknown (n = 98) or untreated prostate cancer with a Gleason score of 6 (n = 29) who underwent direct MRI-guided biopsy of the prostate at our institution between August 2013 and January 2018, after initial multiparametric endorectal MRI examination revealed one or more Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS or PI-RADSv2) category 4 or 5 target lesion. All available medical and imaging records were reviewed to determine pertinent clinical details, biopsy findings, and postbiopsy management. RESULTS. The mean patient age was 68 years (interquartile range, 63-73 years). Findings from MRI-guided biopsy were positive for 93 of 127 patients (73%), with prostate cancer of Gleason score of 7 or higher diagnosed in 84 of these 93 patients (90%). When stratified by clinical scenario, the rate of positive biopsy findings was 66% (57/86) for patients who had negative findings from one or more prior transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsies, 83% (10/12) for biopsy-naive patients, and 90% (26/29) for patients undergoing active surveillance. Overall, 90 of 127 patients (71%) received a new (n = 67) or upgraded (n = 23) diagnosis of prostate cancer, and 57 of these 90 patients (63%) proceeded to receive treatment with prostatectomy, radiation, or androgen deprivation therapy. CONCLUSION. The results of this study suggest that direct MRI-guided biopsy is associated with high rates of significant prostate cancer detection and subsequent definitive treatment across common clinical scenarios and should be considered an important supplementary diagnostic tool in the appropriate setting.""","""['Nicholas P Meermeier', 'Bryan R Foster', 'Jen-Jane Liu', 'Christopher L Amling', 'Fergus V Coakley']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""AJR Am J Roentgenol""","""['Prospective Evaluation of the Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System Version 2 for Prostate Cancer Detection.', 'PI-RADS Version 2 Category on 3 Tesla Multiparametric Prostate Magnetic Resonance Imaging Predicts Oncologic Outcomes in Gleason 3 + 4 Prostate Cancer on Biopsy.', 'Retrospective comparison of direct in-bore magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-guided biopsy and fusion-guided biopsy in patients with MRI lesions which are likely or highly likely to be clinically significant prostate cancer.', 'Prostate Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Magnetic Resonance Imaging Targeted Biopsy in Patients with a Prior Negative Biopsy: A Consensus Statement by AUA and SAR.', 'Targeted prostate biopsy and MR-guided therapy for prostate cancer.', 'Robotic-assisted transrectal MRI-guided biopsy.

Materials and methods:   We reviewed all Genomic Prostate Score results acquired during a 3-year period. Changes in patient NCCN® (National Comprehensive Cancer Network®) risk group, including very low, low, intermediate or high risk, and ultimate management decisions were recorded.  Results:   Genomic Prostate Score risk stratification was performed in 134 men. According to the NCCN Guidelines®, 31 of the 134 men (23.1%) were at very low risk, 45 (33.6%) were at low risk and 58 (43.3%) were at intermediate risk. After adding the score the risk group changed in 32 of 134 patients (23.9%). The risk group did not change in the 31 men at very low risk. However, in the low risk group the risk changed in 19 of the 45 men (42.2%), including in 15 to very low and in 4 to intermediate risk. Also, in the intermediate risk group the risk changed in 13 of the 58 men (22.4%), including to low in 12 and to high risk in 1. Nine of the 15 men (60%) in whom risk changed from low to very low elected active surveillance. Nine of the 12 patients (75%) at intermediate risk in whom risk changed to low risk elected active surveillance, 2 (16.7%) elected definitive therapy and in 1 (8.3%) the choice was unknown. Of the 45 men at intermediate risk in whom risk was unchanged 28 (62.2%) elected definitive therapy, 12 (26.0%) elected active surveillance and in 5 (11.1%) the choice was unknown. Of the 4 men upgraded from low to intermediate risk after adding the genomic prostate score 2 elected definitive therapy and 2 chose active surveillance.  Conclusions:   The Genomic Prostate Score has limited clinical usefulness in patients at very low risk since the NCCN risk group did not change.

Among PBMCs, natural killer (NK) cells appear to be a major cell type involved in this killing and UV-HSV-1 appears to directly and potently stimulate NK cell expression of CD69, degranulation, cytokine production, and migration to IL-8 in PC3 conditioned medium. We also found that UV-HSV-1 stimulates glycolysis in PBMCs and NK cells, and that 2-deoxyglucose and the protein kinase C inhibitor, Go6976, and the NFκB inhibitor, Bay 11-7082, all abrogate UV-HSV-1 activated killing of PC3 cells by PBMCs and NK cells. Using neutralizing anti-Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) we found that UV-HSV-1, like HSV-1, activates NK cells via TLR2. Taken together, these results are consistent with Toll-like receptor 2 ligands on UV-HSV-1 stimulating TLR2 on NK cells to activate protein kinase C, leading to enhanced glycolysis and NFκB activation, both of which play a critical role in this anti-PrCA innate immune response. Importantly, UV-HSV-1 synergizes with IL-15 to increase the cytolytic activity of PBMCs against PC3 cells and there was considerable donor-to-donor variation in killing ability. These results support the preclinical development of UV-HSV-1 as an adjuvant, in combination with IL-15, for cell infusions of healthy, preselected NK cells to treat PrCA.""","""['Ismael Samudio', 'Elyse Hofs', 'Brandon Cho', 'Michael Li', 'Kayla Bolduc', 'Luke Bu', 'Guoyu Liu', 'Vivian Lam', 'Paul Rennie', 'William Jia', 'Ingrid Elisia', 'Gerald Krystal']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""J Immunother""","""['UV-inactivated HSV-1 potently activates NK cell killing of leukemic cells.', 'Phenotype and Function of Activated Natural Killer Cells From Patients With Prostate Cancer: Patient-Dependent Responses to Priming and IL-2 Activation.', 'Both plasmacytoid dendritic cells and monocytes stimulate natural killer cells early during human herpes simplex virus type 1 infections.', 'NK cell tumor therapy modulated by UV-inactivated oncolytic herpes simplex virus type 2 and checkpoint inhibitors.', 'Revisiting Cryptocyanine Dye, NK-4, as an Old and New Drug: Review and Future Perspectives.', 'Natural Killer Cells and Anti-Cancer Therapies: Reciprocal Effects on Immune Function and Therapeutic Response.', 'Induction of Durable Antitumor Response by a Novel Oncolytic Herpesvirus Expressing Multiple Immunomodulatory Transgenes.', 'Oncolytic virotherapy in hepato-bilio-pancreatic cancer: The key to breaking the log jam?']"""

Methods:   Recurrent episodes of hematospermia were the onset symptom in all patients, and in 25% of patients it was combined with fever. All patients reported PSA value elevation and the digital rectal examination (DRE) revealed an increase of the gland size and of its consistency in all cases. In all patients, the hematospermia was treated with the oral administration of two tablets of pollen extract in a single (1 g) dose daily for 30 days.  Results:   Sixteen patients were observed between 2008 and 2016, referring hematospermia, progressive lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS), and serum PSA level increase. To exclude the prostate cancer presence all patients were submitted to transperineal TRUS guided biopsy. In all the patients complete resolution of hematospermia was achieved treatment with pollen extract. All patients were subsequently treated for LUTS (alpha-adrenergic blockers), but none reported any significant improvement of symptoms. Basing on these pieces of evidence, after 90 days of alpha-blockers therapy, all patients underwent bipolar TURP.

Recently, we reported MMP20 expression and interaction with dentin sialophosphoprotein (DSPP), a member of the Small Integrin Binding Ligand N-linked Glycoproteins (SIBLINGs), in human oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) and dysplastic oral premalignant lesions (OPLs), suggesting a role for MMP20-DSPP interaction in oral carcinogenesis.  Methods:   This study aimed to survey the expression of MMP20 and its cognate DSPP partner in the breast, colon, prostate, thyroid, and cervical neoplasms. Using commercially available tissue microarrays (TMAs) and cell lines, we performed immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence, proximity ligation assay, and western blot experiments to determine the expressions of MMP20 and DSPP in the breast, colon, prostate, thyroid, cervical neoplasms, and their normal counterparts.  Results:   Significantly high expression levels of MMP20 and DSPP were observed in the malignant breast, colon, prostate, thyroid, and cervical neoplasms compared with their benign and normal counterparts. Furthermore, MMP20 levels increased with advanced stages of colon and thyroid cancers. DSPP expression increased significantly with tumor stage in all cancers examined.  Conclusions:   The co-localization and potential MMP20-DSPP interaction previously reported in oral cancers are present in other cancers. These results suggest MMP20-DSPP pairing as a potential marker of disease activity in some epithelial cancers with diagnostic and prognostic implications.""","""['Jaya Aseervatham', 'Saxena Geetu', 'Charles C Anunobi', 'Komal Koli', 'Kalu U E Ogbureke']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Cancer Med""","""['Matrix Metalloproteinase 20 Co-expression With Dentin Sialophosphoprotein in Human and Monkey Kidneys.', 'Matrix metalloproteinase 20-dentin sialophosphoprotein interaction in oral cancer.', 'Expression of Matrix Metalloproteinase (MMP)-20 and Potential Interaction with Dentin Sialophosphoprotein (DSPP) in Human Major Salivary Glands.', 'Dentin sialophosphoprotein and dentin matrix protein-1: Two highly phosphorylated proteins in mineralized tissues.', 'Post-translational modifications of sibling proteins and their roles in osteogenesis and dentinogenesis.', 'Unusual Suspects: Bone and Cartilage ECM Proteins as Carcinoma Facilitators.', 'Development and validation of a novel immune-related prognostic signature in lung squamous cell carcinoma patients.', 'The prevalence of germline pathogenic variants in Estonian colorectal cancer patients: results from routine clinical setting 2016-2021.', 'Effects of DSPP Gene Mutations on Periodontal Tissues.', 'Deciphering the genetic alterations in matrix metallo-proteinase gene family and its putative association with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.']"""

We found that CTBP1/MeS regulated expression of genes relevant to cell adhesion and PCa progression, such as cadherins, integrins, connexins, and miRNAs in PC3 xenografts. CTBP1 diminished PCa cell adhesion, membrane attachment to substrate and increased filopodia number by modulating gene expression to favor a mesenchymal phenotype. NSG mice fed with HFD and inoculated with CTBP1-depleted PC3 cells, showed a decreased number and size of lung metastases compared to control.

Since prostate cancer is slow-growing, active surveillance for low-risk cancer has been increasingly supported by various guidelines. Most prostate cancers reactivate telomerase to circumvent the replicative senescence caused by the end replication problem; therefore, telomerase inhibition is potentially useful for the suppression of prostate cancer progression during this active surveillance or for the prevention of cancer recurrence after conventional therapies. In this study, we demonstrated that the perylene derivatives, PM2 and PIPER, could suppress human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) expression and telomerase activity in the short-term treatment of androgen-dependent prostate cancer cell line LNCaP and the androgen-independent prostate cancer cell line PC3 prostate cancer cells. Long-term treatment with subcytotoxic doses of these compounds in both prostate cancer cells showed telomere shortening and a significant increase in senescent cells. Although the acute cytotoxicity of PM2 was about 30 times higher than that of PIPER in both prostate cancer cells, the cellular uptake of both compounds was comparable as determined by flow cytometry and fluorescent microscopy.""","""['Navakoon Kaewtunjai', 'Ratasark Summart', 'Ariyaphong Wongnoppavich', 'Bannakij Lojanapiwat', 'T Randall Lee', 'Wirote Tuntiwechapikul']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Biol Pharm Bull""","""['Telomere shortening and cell senescence induced by perylene derivatives in A549 human lung cancer cells.', 'Pharmacodynamics of telomerase inhibition and telomere shortening by noncytotoxic suramin.', 'Epigallocatechin-3-gallate induces telomere shortening and clastogenic damage in glioblastoma cells.', 'Telomerase inhibition as cancer therapy.', 'Stilbene Compounds Inhibit Tumor Growth by the Induction of Cellular Senescence and the Inhibition of Telomerase Activity.', 'Artemisia argyi exhibits anti-aging effects through decreasing the senescence in aging stem cells.', 'Hydrosoluble Perylene Monoimide-Based Telomerase Inhibitors with Diminished Cytotoxicity.', 'Superiority of an Asymmetric Perylene Diimide in Terms of Hydrosolubility, G-Quadruplex Binding, Cellular Uptake, and Telomerase Inhibition in Prostate Cancer Cells.']"""

Although extensively evaluated in radical prostatectomy (RP) specimens, its significance in prostate biopsy (PB) specimens is understudied.  Objective:   To analyze the clinicopathologic characteristics and treatment outcomes for patients with nonmetastatic PC with EPE on diagnostic PB.  Design, setting, and participants:   We identified all patients at Princess Margaret Cancer Center with EPE on their diagnostic PB between 2005 and 2016. All patients underwent definitive curative-intent treatment with either RP or radiotherapy (RT) with or without androgen deprivation therapy (ADT).  Outcome measurements and statistical analyses:   Clinicopathologic variables were compared using a χ2 or Kruskal-Wallis test; log-rank analyses were applied for outcomes comparison. Primary and secondary endpoints were 5-yr biochemical recurrence (BCR) and the occurrence of metastasis or cancer-specific death, respectively.  Results and limitations:   A total of 127 patients with reported EPE in their PB were identified. One-third of patients underwent RP (n=43) and two-thirds received RT (n=84). Baseline prognostic variables (prostate-specific antigen, clinical T stage, biopsy pathologic grade group, and proportion of cores involved with PC) were similar between the treatment groups. More than two-thirds of RT patients received concomitant ADT (median duration 36 mo, interquartile range 24-36), while 39.5% of RP patients received postoperative radiotherapy±ADT. Of the RP patients, 95.3% had ≥pT3a disease and 27.9% had pN1 disease. Median follow-up after RP and RT was similar (43.7 vs 45.8 mo; p=0.516). The 5-yr BCR and metastasis rates in the RP versus RT groups were 25.6% versus 11.9% (p=0.09) and 7% versus 11.9% (p=0.386), respectively. Only one patient died from metastatic PC (RT group). Limitations include the single-center and retrospective design with a moderate sample size and relatively short follow-up.  Conclusions:   EPE on PB is an infrequent finding that is strongly associated with high-risk clinicopathologic prognostic features that accurately predict EPE in RP specimens. Despite entailing aggressive disease characteristics, EPE on PB should not preclude patients from receiving definitive radical local therapy.  Patient summary:   Extraprostatic extension on prostate biopsies is an uncommon finding, but is strongly correlated to additional aggressive disease features. This finding accurately predicts the presence of extraprostatic extension on the final prostate specimen after surgery. Despite the associated high-risk features, finding extraprostatic extension in prostate biopsies should not preclude patients from undergoing curative-intent radical local therapy.""","""['Hanan Goldberg', 'Abu-Hijlih Ramiz', 'Rachel Glicksman', 'Noelia S Salgado', 'Thenappan Chandrasekar', 'Zachary Klaassen', 'Christopher J D Wallis', 'Ali Hosni', 'Fabio Ynoe Moraes', 'Sangeet Ghai', 'Girish S Kulkarni', 'Robert J Hamilton', 'Nathan Perlis', 'Ants Toi', 'Peter Chung', 'Andrew Evans', 'Theo van der Kwast', 'Antonio Finelli', 'Neil Fleshner', 'Alejandro Berlin']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Eur Urol Oncol""","""['The relationship between the extent of extraprostatic extension and survival following radical prostatectomy.', 'Combined Clinical Parameters and Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging for the Prediction of Extraprostatic Disease-A Risk Model for Patient-tailored Risk Stratification When Planning Radical Prostatectomy.', 'Use of Concomitant Androgen Deprivation Therapy in Patients Treated with Early Salvage Radiotherapy for Biochemical Recurrence After Radical Prostatectomy: Long-term Results from a Large, Multi-institutional Series.', 'Extraprostatic extension in prostate cancer: primer for radiologists.', 'Prostate-Specific Antigen-Based Screening for Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Evidence Review for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force Internet.', 'Target prostate biopsies: How best to report in synoptic format?']"""

The optimal use of additional treatments for PCa with seminal vesicle invasion (pT3b) after RALP remains ill explored.  Objective:   To evaluate the management of pT3b PCa after RALP in current clinical practice.  Design, setting, and participants:   As part of the prospective Belgian RALP Consortium project (October 2009-March 2016), 796 patients with pT3b disease were evaluated.  Intervention:   Robot-assisted radical prostatectomy.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Population and perioperative characteristics were described to assess surgical outcome. Multivariable regression analyses were used to identify independent predictors of lymph node invasion (pN1), positive surgical margins (R+), postoperative morbidity, and additional treatments.  Results and limitations:   In this prospective population-based registry, 85% of patients with clinical high-risk locally advanced PCa received pelvic lymph node dissection (PLND). Early postoperative complications (0-30 d) were observed in 68 patients (8.5%). During oncologic follow-up (median 12 mo), 63% of pN1 patients and 56% of R+ patients received additional therapy. Performing PLND (necessary for assessing pN1 status) was a specific predictor for androgen deprivation therapy only, whereas R+ and younger age were independent predictors for radiotherapy only. Limitations include the nonstandardized policy on additional treatments among hospitals.  Conclusions:   In current practice, RALP is performed with acceptable morbidity for PCa with seminal vesicle invasion and the use of postoperative additional treatments is influenced by different patient, tumor, and surgical variables. Despite the recommendations, 15-21% of patients do not receive adequate pelvic lymph node staging and adjuvant therapy is given in 38% of patients. Full and correct staging of the real disease extent remains important in the management of these patients.

It has been proposed that these tests should be used in a sequential manner to optimise risk stratification.  Objective:   To characterise the genomic, epigenomic, and transcriptomic features of mpMRI-visible and -nonvisible PCa in clinically localised disease.  Design, setting, and participants:   Multicore analysis of fresh prostate tissue sampled immediately after radical prostatectomy was performed for intermediate- to high-risk PCa.  Intervention:   Low-pass whole-genome, exome, methylation, and transcriptome profiling of patient tissue cores taken from microscopically benign and cancerous areas in the same prostate. Circulating free and germline DNA was assessed from the blood of five patients.  Outcome measurement and statistical analysis:   Correlations between preoperative mpMRI and genomic characteristics of tumour and benign prostate samples were assessed. Gene profiles for individual tumour cores were correlated with existing genomic classifiers currently used for prognostication.  Results and limitations:   A total of 43 prostate cores (22 tumour and 21 benign) were profiled from six whole prostate glands. Of the 22 tumour cores, 16 were tumours visible and six were tumours nonvisible on mpMRI. Intratumour genomic, epigenomic, and transcriptomic heterogeneity was found within mpMRI-visible lesions. This could potentially lead to misclassification of patients using signatures based on copy number or RNA expression. Moreover, three of the six cores obtained from mpMRI-nonvisible tumours harboured one or more genetic alterations commonly observed in metastatic castration-resistant PCa. No circulating free DNA alterations were found. Limitations include the small cohort size and lack of follow-up.  Conclusions:   Our study supports the continued use of systematic prostate sampling in addition to mpMRI, as avoidance of systematic biopsies in patients with negative mpMRI may mean that clinically significant tumours harbouring genetic alterations commonly seen in metastatic PCa are missed. Furthermore, there is inconsistency in individual genomics when genomic classifiers are applied.  Patient summary:   Our study shows that tumour heterogeneity within prostate tumours visible on multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) can lead to misclassification of patients if only one core is used for genomic analysis. In addition, some cancers that were missed by mpMRI had genomic aberrations that are commonly seen in advanced metastatic prostate cancer. Avoiding biopsies in mpMRI-negative cases may mean that such potentially lethal cancers are missed.""","""['Marina A Parry', 'Shambhavi Srivastava', 'Adnan Ali', 'Alessio Cannistraci', 'Jenny Antonello', 'João Diogo Barros-Silva', 'Valentina Ubertini', 'Vijay Ramani', 'Maurice Lau', 'Jonathan Shanks', 'Daisuke Nonaka', 'Pedro Oliveira', 'Thomas Hambrock', 'Hui Sun Leong', 'Nathalie Dhomen', 'Crispin Miller', 'Ged Brady', 'Caroline Dive', 'Noel W Clarke', 'Richard Marais', 'Esther Baena']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Eur Urol Oncol""","""['Detection of Gleason 6 prostate cancer in patients with clinically significant prostate cancer on multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging.', 'Outcomes of Serial Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Subsequent Biopsy in Men with Low-risk Prostate Cancer Managed with Active Surveillance.', 'Detection and localisation of primary prostate cancer using 68 gallium prostate-specific membrane antigen positron emission tomography/computed tomography compared with multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging and radical prostatectomy specimen pathology.', 'Can Clinically Significant Prostate Cancer Be Detected with Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging?

Methods:   A Phase III, open-label, multicenter study design for patients with prostate cancer, with patient inclusion assessed by the investigative site as patient's appropriate for androgen deprivation therapy. Patients received 2 separate intramuscular injections of leuprolide acetate 22.5-mg depot for a 3-month depot interval of therapeutic effect. Plasma testosterone concentrations were determined throughout the study. The primary efficacy analysis was the percentage of patients who achieve and maintain castrate testosterone levels (≤50 ng/mL) from days 28-168. Secondary end points included luteinizing hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone, prostate-specific antigen, and safety assessments. A pharmacokinetic study was also conducted in a subset of 30 patients.  Findings:   All 163 patients enrolled in the study received at least 1 dose of study drug; 162 of them were fully evaluable and 151 completed the study. Castrate levels of testosterone were achieved and maintained from days 28-168 in 96.8% (95% CI, 92.5%-98.7%) of patients. Five patients presented with sporadic testosterone levels >50 ng/dL. By day 28, of the 161 patients, 150 (99.4%) had achieved castrate levels, and 127 (78.9%) had achieved testosterone concentrations ≤20 ng/dL. At study end, 149 of 151 patients (98.7%) patients achieved castrate testosterone levels, with 142 of 151 (94.0%) having testosterone levels ≤20 ng/dL. At study end, mean luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone concentrations had decreased from baseline to below the lower limit of quantitation and below baseline levels, respectively, whereas mean serum prostate-specific antigen was reduced by 94.7% from baseline. Most patients (>96%) had no change in their World Health Organization/Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group score, whereby 84.0% of patients had a baseline score of 0. Bone pain, urinary pain, and urinary symptoms were infrequent and remained so throughout the study. After administration, leuprolide concentrations increased rapidly. The peak was followed by a decline up to day 28, maintaining sustained drug levels until the following dose on day 84. The most common related treatment-emergent adverse events, detected in >5% of patients, were hot flushes, fatigue, and injection site pain reported by 77.3%, 9.8%, and 9.2% of patients, respectively.

Most common marker segmentation methods require prior knowledge of marker properties to construct a template. If marker properties are not known, an additional learning period is required to build the template which exposes the patient to an additional imaging dose. This work investigates a deep learning-based fiducial marker classifier for use in real-time IGART that requires no prior patient-specific data or additional learning periods. The proposed tracking system uses convolutional neural network (CNN) models to segment cylindrical and arbitrarily shaped fiducial markers.  Methods:   The tracking system uses a tracking window approach to perform sliding window classification of each implanted marker. Three cylindrical marker training datasets were generated from phantom kilovoltage (kV) and patient intrafraction images with increasing levels of megavoltage (MV) scatter. The cylindrical shaped marker CNNs were validated on unseen kV fluoroscopic images from 12 fractions of 10 prostate cancer patients with implanted gold fiducials. For the training and validation of the arbitrarily shaped marker CNNs, cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) projection images from ten fractions of seven lung cancer patients with implanted coiled markers were used. The arbitrarily shaped marker CNNs were trained using three patients and the other four unseen patients were used for validation. The effects of full training using a compact CNN (four layers with learnable weights) and transfer learning using a pretrained CNN (AlexNet, eight layers with learnable weights) were analyzed. Each CNN was evaluated using a Precision-Recall curve (PRC), the area under the PRC plot (AUC), and by the calculation of sensitivity and specificity. The tracking system was assessed using the validation data and the accuracy was quantified by calculating the mean error, root-mean-square error (RMSE) and the 1st and 99th percentiles of the error.  Results:   The fully trained CNN on the dataset with moderate noise levels had a sensitivity of 99.00% and specificity of 98.92%. Transfer learning of AlexNet resulted in a sensitivity and specificity of 99.42% and 98.13%, respectively, for the same datasets. For the arbitrarily shaped marker CNNs, the sensitivity was 98.58% and specificity was 98.97% for the fully trained CNN. The transfer learning CNN had a sensitivity and specificity of 98.49% and 99.56%, respectively. The CNNs were successfully incorporated into a multiple object tracking system for both cylindrical and arbitrarily shaped markers. The cylindrical shaped marker tracking had a mean RMSE of 1.6 ± 0.2 pixels and 1.3 ± 0.4 pixels in the x- and y-directions, respectively. The arbitrarily shaped marker tracking had a mean RMSE of 3.0 ± 0.5 pixels and 2.2 ± 0.4 pixels in the x- and y-directions, respectively.  Conclusion:   With deep learning CNNs, high classification performances on unseen patient images were achieved for both cylindrical and arbitrarily shaped markers. Furthermore, the application of CNN models to intrafraction monitoring was demonstrated using a simple tracking system. The results demonstrate that CNN models can be used to track markers without prior knowledge of the marker properties or an additional learning period.""","""['Adam Mylonas', 'Paul J Keall', 'Jeremy T Booth', 'Chun-Chien Shieh', 'Thomas Eade', 'Per Rugaard Poulsen', 'Doan Trang Nguyen']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Deep learning enables MV-based real-time image guided radiation therapy for prostate cancer patients.', 'Evaluation of deep learning based implanted fiducial markers tracking in pancreatic cancer patients.', 'Automatic tracking of arbitrarily shaped implanted markers in kilovoltage projection images: a feasibility study.', 'Automatic Segmentation of Multiple Organs on 3D CT Images by Using Deep Learning Approaches.', '3D Deep Learning on Medical Images: A Review.', 'Automatic prediction model for online diaphragm motion tracking based on optical surface monitoring by machine learning.', 'Using Artificial Intelligence for Optimization of the Processes and Resource Utilization in Radiotherapy.', 'Management of Motion and Anatomical Variations in Charged Particle Therapy: Past, Present, and Into the Future.', 'Artificial intelligence for assisting cancer diagnosis and treatment in the era of precision medicine.', 'Automatic Detection and Tracking of Marker Seeds Implanted in Prostate Cancer Patients using a Deep Learning Algorithm.']"""

Methods:   We retrospectively studied patients whose pre-operative 1.5T mpMRI had shown a visible tumour and who subsequently underwent radical prostatectomy (RP). Guided by tumour location from the histopathology report, we drew a region of interest around the dominant visible lesion on a single axial slice on the T2, Apparent Diffusion Coefficient (ADC) map and early arterial phase post-contrast T1 image. We then performed TA with a filtration-histogram software (TexRAD -Feedback Medical Ltd, Cambridge, UK). We correlated GS and D'Amico risk with texture using the Spearman's rank correlation test.  Results:   We had 26 RP patients with an MR-visible tumour. Mean of positive pixels (MPP) on ADC showed a significant negative correlation with GS at coarse texture scales. MPP showed a significant negative correlation with GS without filtration and with medium filtration. MRI contrast texture without filtration showed a significant, negative correlation with D'Amico score. MR T2 texture showed a significant, negative correlation with the D'Amico risk, particularly at textures without filtration, medium texture scales and coarse texture scales.  Conclusion:   ADC map mpMRI TA correlated negatively with GS, and T2 and post-contrast images with the D'Amico risk score. These associations may allow for better assessment of disease prognosis and a non-invasive method of follow-up for patients on surveillance.

Here, we took advantage of in vitro and ex vivo bone cell and organ cultures to study the effects of PTN on the ability of prostate cancer cells and their derived factors to regulate bone cell activity and osteolysis. PTN inhibited the in vitro growth of a panel of human, mouse and rat prostate cancer cells in a concentration-dependent manner with a varying degree of potency. In prostate cancer cell-osteoclast co-cultures, the rat Mat-Ly-Lu, but not human PC3 or mouse RM1-BT, enhanced RANKL stimulated osteoclast formation and PTN reduced these effects without affecting prostate cancer cell viability. In the absence of cancer cells, PTN reduced the support of Mat-Ly-Lu conditioned medium for the adhesion and spreading of osteoclast precursors, and survival of mature osteoclasts. Pre-exposure of osteoblasts to PTN prior to the addition of conditioned medium from Mat-Ly-Lu cells suppressed their ability to support the formation of osteoclasts by inhibition of RANKL/OPG ratio. PTN enhanced the ability of Mat-Ly-Lu derived factors to increase calvarial osteoblast differentiation and growth. Ex vivo, PTN enhanced bone volume in calvaria organ-Mat-Ly-Lu cell co-culture, without affecting Mat-Ly-Lu viability or apoptosis. Mechanistic studies in osteoclasts and osteoblasts confirmed that PTN inhibit NFκB activation related to derived factors from Mat-Ly-Lu cells. Collectively, these findings suggest that pharmacological inhibition of the skeletal NFκB signalling pathway reduces prostate cancer related osteolysis, but further studies in the therapeutic implications of NFκB inhibition in cells of the osteoblastic lineage are needed.""","""['Silvia Marino', 'Ryan T Bishop', 'Giovana Carrasco', 'John G Logan', 'Boya Li', 'Aymen I Idris']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Calcif Tissue Int""","""['Pharmacological evidence for the bone-autonomous contribution of the NFκB/β-catenin axis to breast cancer related osteolysis.', 'Pharmacological Inhibition of the Skeletal IKKβ Reduces Breast Cancer-Induced Osteolysis.', 'Bone Cell-autonomous Contribution of Type 2 Cannabinoid Receptor to Breast Cancer-induced Osteolysis.', 'The role of osteoclastic activity in prostate cancer skeletal metastases.', 'Prostate cancer bone metastases promote both osteolytic and osteoblastic activity.', 'The therapeutic effect and mechanism of parthenolide in skeletal disease, cancers, and cytokine storm.', 'The roles of osteoprotegerin in cancer, far beyond a bone player.', 'The Emerging Potential of Parthenolide Nanoformulations in Tumor Therapy.', 'Parthenolide leads to proteomic differences in thyroid cancer cells and promotes apoptosis.', 'NOD-like receptor X1, tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6 and NF-κB are associated with clinicopathological characteristics in gastric cancer.']"""

Design:   Prospective cohort.  Setting:   All PSA tested men in Stockholm, Sweden, between 2003 and 2015.

Results:   Men with PSA ≤1 ng/mL had low risk of GS ≥7 prostate cancer irrespective of testing interval; <3% had a PSA >3 at the next testing occasion, and of the 663 men biopsied after the next PSA test only 32 (5%) had GS ≥7 cancer.

In this paper, we propose a novel automatic segmentation framework using fully convolutional networks with boundary sensitive representation to address this challenging problem. Our novel segmentation framework contains three modules. First, an organ localization model is designed to focus on the candidate segmentation region of each organ for better performance. Then, a boundary sensitive representation model based on multi-task learning is proposed to represent the semantic boundary information in a more robust and accurate manner. Finally, a multi-label cross-entropy loss function combining boundary sensitive representation is introduced to train a fully convolutional network for the organ segmentation. The proposed method is evaluated on a large and diverse planning CT dataset with 313 images from 313 prostate cancer patients.

Overall, we link a cancer cell-specific GPCR with the nuclear AR and show that targeting PSGR can provide us a new target to combat PCa better.""","""['Hongjun Xie', 'Tianjie Liu', 'Jiaqi Chen', 'Zhao Yang', 'Shan Xu', 'Yizeng Fan', 'Jin Zeng', 'Yule Chen', 'Zhenkun Ma', 'Yang Gao', 'Dalin He', 'Lei Li']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Cancer Lett""","""['Activation of an olfactory receptor inhibits proliferation of prostate cancer cells.', 'Quantitative phosphoproteomics reveals the protein tyrosine kinase Pyk2 as a central effector of olfactory receptor signaling in prostate cancer cells.', 'Neuroendocrine prostate cancer (NEPCa) increased the neighboring PCa chemoresistance via altering the PTHrP/p38/Hsp27/androgen receptor (AR)/p21 signals.', 'Prostate-Specific G-Protein Coupled Receptor, an Emerging Biomarker Regulating Inflammation and Prostate Cancer Invasion.', 'Stromal androgen receptor roles in the development of normal prostate, benign prostate hyperplasia, and prostate cancer.', 'The Metabolomic Profile of the Essential Oil from Zanthoxylum caribaeum (syn. chiloperone) Growing in Guadeloupe FWI using GC × GC-TOFMS.', 'MAPK8IP2 is a potential prognostic biomarker and promote tumor progression in prostate cancer.', 'The olfactory receptor OR51E2 activates ERK1/2 through the Golgi-localized Gβγ-PI3Kγ-ARF1 pathway in prostate cancer cells.', 'Carotenoids and Apocarotenoids in Planta: Their Role in Plant Development, Contribution to the Flavour and Aroma of Fruits and Flowers, and Their Nutraceutical Benefits.', 'Burmannic Acid Inhibits Proliferation and Induces Oxidative Stress Response of Oral Cancer Cells.']"""

We compared outcomes of AS eligible patients undergoing RP immediately after diagnosis with those doing so after delay or disease progression on AS.  Methods:   Between 2000 and 2014, 961 patients were AS eligible as per EAU criteria. RP within 6 months of diagnosis (IRP) or beyond (DRP), RP without AS (DRPa) and AS patients progressing to RP (DRPb) were compared. Baseline PSA, clinical and biopsy characteristics were noted. Oncological outcomes included adverse pathology in RP specimen and biochemical recurrence (BCR). Matched pair analysis was done between DRPb and GS7 patients undergoing immediate RP (GS7IRP).  Results:   IRP, DRP, DRPa and DRPb had 820 (85%), 141 (15%), 118 (12.24%) and 23 (2.7%) patients respectively. IRP, DRPa and DRPb underwent RP at a median of 3, 9 and 19 months after diagnosis respectively. Baseline characteristics were comparable. DRP vs. IRP had earlier median time (31 vs. 43 months; p<.001) and higher rate of progression to BCR (7.6 vs. 3.9%;p=.045). DRPb showed higher BCR (19 vs. 5%;p=.021) with earlier median time to BCR, compared to IRP and DRPa (p=.038). There was no difference in adverse pathology and BCR rates, but time to BCR was significantly lesser in DRPb (49 vs. 6 months;p<.001), compared to GS7IRP.  Conclusions:   Patients progressing on AS had worst oncological outcomes. RP for GS7 progression and matched pair of GS7 patients had similar outcomes. Worse oncological outcomes in AS progressors cannot be explained by a mere delay in RP.""","""['A Mallya', 'V Senguttuvan-Karthikeyan', 'A Sivaraman', 'E Barret', 'M Galiano', 'N Cathala', 'A Mombet', 'D Prapotnich', 'R Sanchez-Salas', 'X Cathelineau']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Actas Urol Esp (Engl Ed)""","""['Immediate versus delayed radical prostatectomy: updated outcomes following active surveillance of prostate cancer.', 'Pathological, oncologic and functional outcomes of radical prostatectomy following active surveillance.', 'Long-term cancer control outcomes in patients with biochemical recurrence and the impact of time from radical prostatectomy to biochemical recurrence.', 'Outcomes of Grade Group 2 and 3 Prostate Cancer on Initial Versus Confirmatory Biopsy: Implications for Active Surveillance.', 'Effects of Delayed Radical Prostatectomy and Active Surveillance on Localised Prostate Cancer-A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.']"""

Objective:   To quantify the contribution of treatment differences to the observed PC mortality reduction between the screening arm (SA) and the control arm (CA).  Design, setting, and participants:   A total of 14 136 men with PC (SA: 7310; CA: 6826) in the core age group (55-69yr) at 16yr of follow-up.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   The outcomes measurements were observed and estimated numbers of PC deaths by treatment allocation in the SA and CA, respectively. Primary treatment allocation was modeled using multinomial logistic regression adjusting for center, age, year, prostate-specific antigen, grade group, and tumor-node-metastasis stage. For each treatment, logistic regression models were fitted for risk of PC death, separately for the SA and CA, and using the same covariates as for the treatment allocation model. Treatment probabilities were multiplied by estimated PC death risks for each treatment based on one arm, and then summed and compared with the observed number of deaths.  Results and limitations:   The difference between the observed and estimated treatment distributions (hormonal therapy, radical prostatectomy, radiotherapy, and active surveillance/watchful waiting) in the two arms ranged from -3.3% to 3.3%. These figures, which represent the part of the treatment differences between arms that cannot be explained by clinicopathological differences, are small compared with the observed differences between arms that ranged between 7.2% and 10.1%. The difference between the observed and estimated numbers of PC deaths among men with PC was 0.05% (95% confidence interval [CI] -0.1%, 0.2%) when applying the CA model to the SA, had the two groups received identical primary treatment, given their clinical characteristics. When instead applying the SA model to the CA, the difference was, as expected, very similar-0.01% (95% CI -0.3%, 0.2%). Consistency of the results of the models demonstrates the robustness of the modeling approach. As the observed difference between trial arms was 4.2%, our findings suggest that differential treatment explains only a trivial proportion of the main findings of ERSPC. A limitation of the study is that only data on primary treatment were available.  Conclusions:   Use of prostate-specific antigen remains the predominant explanation for the reduction in PC mortality seen in the ERSPC trial and is not attributable to differential treatment between trial arms.  Patient summary:   This study shows that prostate cancer deaths in the European screening trial (European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer) were prevented because men were diagnosed and treated earlier through prostate-specific antigen screening, and not because of different, or better, treatment in the screening arm compared with the control arm.""","""['Sigrid V Carlsson', 'Marianne Månsson', 'Sue Moss', 'Maciej Kwiatkowski', 'Franz Recker', 'Teuvo L J Tammela', 'Chris Bangma', 'Monique J Roobol', 'Anssi Auvinen', 'Jonas Hugosson']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Eur Urol""","""['Prostate cancer mortality in the Finnish randomized screening trial.', 'Prostate-specific antigen screening trials and prostate cancer deaths: the androgen deprivation connection.', 'The effect of study arm on prostate cancer treatment in the large screening trial ERSPC.', 'Prostate-Specific Antigen-Based Screening for Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Evidence Review for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force Internet.', 'Prostate-Specific Antigen-Based Screening for Prostate Cancer: Evidence Report and Systematic Review for the US Preventive Services Task Force.', 'The Patient Journey from Randomization to Detection of Prostate Cancer and Death: Results from ERSPC Rotterdam.', 'Intervention-related Deaths in the European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer.']"""

Several recent studies have identified genomic alterations in mCRPC, but the clinical implications of these genomic alterations have not been fully elucidated.  Objective:   To use whole-genome sequencing (WGS) to assess the association between key driver gene alterations and overall survival (OS), and to use whole-transcriptome RNA sequencing to identify genomic drivers of enzalutamide resistance.  Design, setting, and participants:   We performed survival analyses and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) on WGS and RNA sequencing results for a cohort of 101 mCRPC patients.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   OS was the clinical endpoint for all univariate and multivariable survival analyses. Candidate drivers of enzalutamide resistance were identified in an unbiased manner, and mutations of the top candidate were further assessed for enrichment among enzalutamide-resistant patients using Fisher's exact test.  Results and limitations:   Harboring two DNA alterations in RB1 was independently predictive of poor OS (median 14.1 vs 42.0mo; p=0.007) for men with mCRPC. GSEA identified the Wnt/β-catenin pathway as the top differentially modulated pathway among enzalutamide-resistant patients. Furthermore, β-catenin mutations were exclusive to enzalutamide-resistant patients (p=0.01) and independently predictive of poor OS (median 13.6 vs 41.7mo; p=0.025).  Conclusions:   The presence of two RB1 DNA alterations identified in our WGS analysis was independently associated with poor OS among men with mCRPC. The Wnt/β-catenin pathway plays an important role in enzalutamide resistance, with differential pathway expression and enrichment of β-catenin mutations in enzalutamide-resistant patients. Moreover, β-catenin mutations were predictive of poor OS in our cohort.  Patient summary:   We observed a correlation between genomic findings for biopsy samples from metastases from men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) and clinical outcomes.

Method:   Monte Carlo simulations of source positions representing three separate real-time TRUS based HDR pBT treatments were performed using the Geant4 toolkit. For each source position, an Ir-192 source was simulated inside a voxelized patient geometry. Dose deposited from each source position to the MP900 diodes was used to perform source tracking, and the MP900 calculated position compared to known source positions from the treatment plan. Thresholding techniques were implemented to improve source tracking accuracy with the TRUS probe present.  Results:   The average three-dimensional source position reconstruction discrepancy was 11.9 ± 2.4 mm and 1.5 ± 0.3 mm with and without the TRUS probe, respectively. Thresholding techniques improved the source position reconstruction discrepancy in the presence of the TRUS probe to 1.8 ± 0.4 mm.  Conclusion:   Inclusion of the TRUS probe inside the patient negatively affects source tracking accuracy when using the MP900 diode array for HDR pBT verification. Modification of the source tracking algorithm using thresholding techniques improves source tracking in the presence of the TRUS probe, achieving similar accuracy as when the TRUS probe is not present.

Methods:   Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) were trained to segment 49 bones using manual segmentations from 100 CT scans. After training, the CNN-based segmentation method was tested on 46 patients with prostate cancer, who had undergone 18F-choline-PET/CT and 18F-NaF PET/CT less than three weeks apart. Bone volumes were calculated from the segmentations. The network's performance was compared with manual segmentations of five bones made by an experienced physician. Accuracy of the spatial overlap between automated CNN-based and manual segmentations of these five bones was assessed using the Sørensen-Dice index (SDI). Reproducibility was evaluated applying the Bland-Altman method.  Results:   The median (SD) volumes of the five selected bones were by CNN and manual segmentation: Th7 41 (3.8) and 36 (5.1), L3 76 (13) and 75 (9.2), sacrum 284 (40) and 283 (26), 7th rib 33 (3.9) and 31 (4.8), sternum 80 (11) and 72 (9.2), respectively. Median SDIs were 0.86 (Th7), 0.85 (L3), 0.88 (sacrum), 0.84 (7th rib) and 0.83 (sternum).

Results:   Major barriers to medical help seeking were highlighted as lack of knowledge and awareness of the prostate gland and symptoms of PCa, the digital rectal exam (DRE), prostate-specific antigen (PSA), cultural and religious beliefs, and hegemonic masculinity norms and nonreporting of bodily changes to GPs. Fear of DRE, distrust in providers, and misinterpretation of bodily changes as related to ageing and diabetes mellitus also contributed to delays towards seeking medical help.

The study is a retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data. We excluded cases who were under androgen deprivation or had prior treatments. The population included negative cases (control group) and PSM subjects (study groups). The logistic regression model assessed the independent association of factors with the risk of PSM. From January 2013 to December 2017, 732 patients underwent RARP. Extended pelvic lymph node dissection was performed in 342 cases (46.7%). Overall, 192 cases (26.3%) had PSM. Independent factors associated with the risk of focal PSM were body mass index (odds ratio, OR = 0.936; p = 0.021), percentage of biopsy-positive cores (BPC; OR = 1.012; p = 0.004), pathological extracapsular extension (OR = 2.702; p < 0.0001), seminal vesicle invasion (OR = 2.889; p < 0.0001) and high-volume surgeon (OR = 0.607; p = 0.006). In high-volume centers, features related to host, tumor biology and surgeon are independent factors associated with the risk of PSM after RARP, which are decreased by the high-volume surgeon. The inverse association between BMI and PSM risk needs further clinical research.

The neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) has been proposed as easily assessable markers of systemic inflammation and has been shown to represent a prognostic marker in prostate cancer in previous studies.  Methods:   Data from 668 patients with localized prostate cancer treated with prostatectomy (open and robot assisted) in Singapore General Hospital from 1998 to 2014 were analyzed. Correlation between NLR and histopathological status was analyzed. Association between NLR and distant metastases-free survival (MFS), cancer-specific survival (CSS), overall survival (OS), and biochemical disease-free survival (BDFS) was assessed.  Results:   NLR was not significantly correlated with histopathological status, including Gleason score (≤ 6 versus 7 versus ≥ 8, p = 0.159), lymph node metastasis (negative versus positive, p = 0.159), or surgical margin status (negative versus positive, p = 0.494). NLR was categorized into two groups (< median and ≥ median, median = 2.09) and NLR ≥ 2.09 was not a prognostic factor for decreased MFS (p = 0.609), CSS (p = 0.302), OS (p = 0.722) and BDFS (p = 0.589). No difference was observed for NLR even in high-risk subgroup patients compared to the rest (p = 0.058).

Therefore, we aimed to investigate the expression and localization of Skp2 in clinical samples from patients with PCa, the association of Skp2 with EMT status, and the role of Skp2 in prostate CSC. We found that nuclear expression of Skp2 was increased in patients with PCa compared to those with benign hyperplasia, and correlated with high Gleason score in PCa patients. Increased Skp2 expression was observed in PCa cell lines with mesenchymal and CSC-like phenotype compared to their epithelial counterparts. Conversely, the CSC-like phenotype was diminished in cells in which SKP2 expression was silenced. Furthermore, we observed that Skp2 downregulation led to the decrease in subpopulation of CD44+CD24- cancer stem-like cells.

The TR-HS integrates high-speed imaging and computer vision to automatically detect and track single cells suspended in a fluid and enables cell classification based on their mechanical properties. We demonstrate the discrimination of healthy and cancerous prostate cell lines based on the whole-cell, time-resolved mechanical response to a hydrodynamic load. Additionally, we implement a finite element method (FEM) model to characterise the forces responsible for the cell deformation in our device.

Preclinical studies demonstrated that high-dose pantoprazole can prevent or delay resistance to docetaxel via the inhibition of autophagy in several solid tumor xenografts.  Materials and methods:   Men with chemotherapy-naive mCRPC with a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) >10 ng/mL were eligible for enrolment. Men received intravenous pantoprazole (240 mg) prior to docetaxel (75 mg/m2) every 21 days, with continuous prednisone 5 mg twice daily. Primary endpoint was a confirmed ≥50% decline of PSA. The trial used a Simon's two-stage design.  Results:   Between November 2012 and March 2015, 21 men with a median age of 70 years (range, 58-81) were treated (median, 6 cycles; range, 2-11). Men had received prior systemic therapies (median, 1; range, 0-3), and 14 had received abiraterone and/or enzalutamide. PSA response rate was 52% (11/21), which did not meet the prespecified criterion (≥13/21 responders) to proceed to stage 2 of the study. At interim analysis with a median follow-up of 17 months, 18 (86%) men were deceased (15 castration-resistant prostate cancer, 2 unknown, 1 radiation complication). Of the men with RECIST measurable disease, the radiographic partial response rate was 31% (4/13). The estimated median overall survival was 15.7 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 9.3-19.6) and median PFS was 5.3 months (95% CI, 2.6-12.9). There were no toxic deaths, and all adverse events were attributed to docetaxel.  Conclusion:   The combination of docetaxel and pantoprazole was tolerable, but the resultant clinical activity was not sufficient to meet the ambitious predefined target to warrant further testing.  Implications for practice:   To date, no docetaxel combination regimen has reported superior efficacy over docetaxel alone in men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). The PANDORA trial has demonstrated that the combination of high dose pantoprazole with docetaxel is tolerable, but the clinical activity was not sufficient to warrant further testing.

Transcriptome analysis of multiple prostate cancer models identified CXCR7, an atypical chemokine receptor, as one of the most upregulated genes in enzalutamide-resistant cells. AR directly repressed CXCR7 by binding to an enhancer 110 kb downstream of the gene and expression was restored upon androgen deprivation. We demonstrate that CXCR7 is a critical regulator of prostate cancer sensitivity to enzalutamide and is required for CRPC growth in vitro and in vivo. Elevated CXCR7 activated MAPK/ERK signaling through ligand-independent, but β-arrestin 2-dependent mechanisms. Examination of patient specimens showed that CXCR7 and pERK levels increased significantly from localized prostate cancer to CRPC and further upon enzalutamide resistance. Preclinical studies revealed remarkable efficacies of MAPK/ERK inhibitors in suppressing enzalutamide-resistant prostate cancer. Overall, these results indicate that CXCR7 may serve as a biomarker of resistant disease in patients with prostate cancer and that disruption of CXCR7 signaling may be an effective strategy to overcome resistance.

Methods:   A 27-item cross-sectional survey was developed with input from a multidisciplinary team and distributed electronically to Genitourinary (GU) CROs via LimeSurvey. Survey contents included: demographics, treatment choice based on components of GA, and how GA tools are used in clinic. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze multiple-choice data, with Open-ended question being coded and analyzed for emerging themes.  Results:   154 GU CRO's were contacted, 44 responded (29%). Active surveillance was the choice of therapy in older low risk prostate cancer patients regardless of factors used in a GA assessment (97%). Results in intermediate and high-risk older prostate cancer patients were more heterogenous. Functional status and comorbidities were the most important factor in the decision-making-process (94%, 91%). Sixty-six percent of CROs did not use any GA tools; yet 77% felt comfortable to very comfortable treating older patients. Eighty-eight percent felt there were some to very few guidelines in helping them to treat older patients. Barriers to using GA included lack of knowledge, time, support, and resources.  Conclusions:   GAs are not commonly utilized by CROs. Majority of CROs felt comfortable treating older patients with prostate cancer, regardless of guidelines/evidence in this population.

While cancer diagnoses themselves are very stressful for patients and families, little is known about the health status, functional limitations, and social resources of older patients before they face a new cancer diagnosis.  Materials and methods:   Using the National Health and Aging Trends Study (NHATS), a national survey of older Medicare beneficiaries linked to Medicare claims data, we examined the health characteristics, functional limitations and social and financial resources of older adults before a new diagnosis of lung, breast, prostate or colorectal cancer and how these factors vary by race/ethnicity.  Results:   We identified 274 community-dwelling older adults with incident cancer diagnoses: lung (30.6%), breast (20.3%), prostate (30.8%), and colorectal (18.3%) representing 1,202,920 older Medicare beneficiaries. The sample was 81% Non-Hispanic White, 10% Non-Hispanic Black, and 9% Hispanic/Other. Before diagnosis, patients had an average of three comorbidities and 29% of patients reported poor/fair health.

Successful inverse planning of radiotherapeutic treatment depends on the tweaking of many parameters; a tool was thus needed to explore these parameters more exhaustively without significantly increasing planning time. The software that we used was based on an open-source library that mimics human interaction with Microsoft Windows applications. We developed a simple Autoflow software routine that analyzes and optimizes calculated plans by considering the relative impact of different cost functions and modifying constraints accordingly. It was also designed to change segmentation parameters to fit more complex treatments. The toolkit is publicly available for download at https://bitbucket.org/hgugmradiofisica/pymonaco/src/master/. A study of prostate cancer cases was conducted to compare automatically created plans with previously treated cases. The toolkit fully automated the radiotherapy planning procedure, allowing the TPS to calculate or optimize plans during nonworking hours. In the prostate study, the use of this tool reduced the dose to organs at risk with a negligible decrease in target coverage. This tool enables the efficient use of the TPS, allowing research and clinical applications to coexist without conflict. It provides consistency and efficiency throughout the treatment planning process, which may be of great value to clinics with few resources.

However, the clinical significance and molecular mechanisms of EZH2 controlling gastric cancer cell proliferation and invasion are not well documented. In this study, immunohistochemical analysis was conducted to investigate the EZH2 expression in gastric cancer. We found that EZH2 levels were increased in gastric cancer tissues compared with adjacent normal tissues. Moreover, patients with high levels of EZH2 expression had a relatively poor prognosis. Furthermore, knockdown of EZH2 expression by siRNA could impair cell proliferation and invasion both in vitro and vivo.

National guidelines in several countries recommend routine screening for emotional distress in patients with cancer, but in many clinics, this is not implemented. By inventing screening methods that are time-efficient, such as digitalized and automatized screenings with short instruments, we can alleviate the burden on patients and staff.  Objective:   The aim of this study was to compare Web-based versions of the ultrashort electronic Visual Analogue Scale (eVAS) anxiety and eVAS depression and the short Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) with Web-based versions of the longer Montgomery Åsberg Depression Rating Scale-Self-report (MADRS-S) and the State Trait Anxiety Inventory- State (STAI-S) with regard to their ability to identify symptoms of anxiety and depression in patients with cancer.  Methods:   Data were obtained from a consecutive sample of patients with newly diagnosed (<6 months) breast, prostate, or colorectal cancer or with recurrence of colorectal cancer (N=558). The patients were recruited at 4 hospitals in Sweden between April 2013 and September 2015, as part of an intervention study administered via the internet. All questionnaires were completed on the Web at the baseline assessment in the intervention study.  Results:   The ultrashort and short Web-based-delivered eVAS anxiety, eVAS depression and HADS were found to have an excellent ability to discriminate between persons with and without clinical levels of symptoms of anxiety and depression compared with recommended cutoffs of the longer instruments MADRS-S and STAI-S (area under the curve: 0.88-0.94). Cutoffs of >6 on HADS anxiety and >7 hundredths (hs) on eVAS anxiety identified patients with anxiety symptoms with high accuracy. For HADS depression, at a cutoff of >5 and eVAS depression at a cutoff of >7 hs, the accuracy was very high likewise.  Conclusions:   The use of the short and ultrashort tools, eVAS and HADS, may be a suitable initial method of Web-based screening in busy clinical settings. However, there are still a proportion of patients who lack access to the internet or the ability to use it.

Prostate cancer grading is an important basis for evaluation of invasion. The purpose of this article was to use dynamic enhanced scan magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to quantitatively investigate the relationship between tumor oxygenation value and prostate cancer pathological Gleason score. MATERIAL AND METHODS A total of 312 prostate cancer patients diagnosed by needle biopsy who received MRI dynamic enhanced scan were enrolled in this study. Multiparameter oxygen concentration image based on MRI was applied to test pO2 in tumors. Multiple spin resonance image relaxation time edit sequence and weak field diffusion model were used to estimate oxygen saturation level and pO2. hematoxylin and eosin staining and Gleason score were used to determine biological behavior and prognosis. RESULTS According to the Gleason score system, there were 28 cases with a score of 10, 112 cases with a score of 9, 56 cases with a score of 8, and 116 cases with a score lower than 7. The enrolled patients were divided into groups: 116 cases into the middle-to-well differentiation group (Gleason score ≤7) and 196 cases into the poorly differentiation group (Gleason score at 8 to 10). Prostate cancer tumor oxygenation value was positively correlated with Gleason score (r=0.349, P<0.05) or PSA (r=0.432, P<0.05). Tumor oxygenation value in Gleason ≤7 group was obviously different from that in the group with Gleason score between 9 and 10 (P<0.05).

However, implementation of recommended team-based cancer care has lagged, and determinants of quality care across primary and specialty care remain unclear. Guided by the theoretical domains framework (TDF), we explored multidisciplinary determinants of quality survivorship care in an integrated delivery system.  Methods:   We conducted semistructured interviews with primary (4) and specialty (7) care providers across 6 Veterans Health Administration clinic sites. Using template analysis, we coded interview transcripts into the TDF, mapping statements to specific constructs within each domain. We assessed whether each construct was perceived a barrier or facilitator, examining results for both primary care providers (PCPs) and prostate cancer specialists.  Results:   Cancer specialists and PCPs identified 2 primary TDF domains impacting their prostate cancer survivorship care: Knowledge and Environmental context and resources. Both groups noted knowledge (about survivorship care) and procedural knowledge (about how to deliver survivorship care) as positive determinants or facilitators, whereas resources/material resources (to deliver survivorship care) was noted as a negative determinant or barrier to care. Additional domains more commonly referenced by cancer specialists included Social/professional role and identity and Goals, while PCPs reported the domain Beliefs about capabilities as relevant.  Conclusions:   We used the TDF to identify several behavioral domains acting as determinants of high-quality, team-based prostate cancer survivorship care.

In this study, we investigated the prevalence of breakthrough cancer pain (BTcP) in patients undergoing 3D pelvic radiotherapy and who had proctalgia.  Methods:   This observational, multicenter, cross-sectional epidemiological study was performed in 13 Spanish hospitals. Data were obtained on the presence and characteristics of BTcP, demographics, common comorbidities, and treatments prescribed to the patients.  Results:   The prevalence of BTcP in patients undergoing pelvic 3D external radiotherapy with proctalgia (N = 105) was 48.6% (95% CI 39.0-58.1%). BTcP was further characterized in 59 patients. The mean (± SD) intensity of the BTcP episodes was 7.45 ± 1.47 in a visual analog scale. We found several statistically significant associations between the descriptive variables of BTcP with demographic and clinical variables associated with the tumor or the patient, such as an increased number of BTcP episodes per day depending on the presence or absence of diabetes (p = 0.001, Chi-square) or time to the onset of pain relief depending on the location of the tumor (p = 0.019, Chi-square). Fentanyl was the drug of choice in BTcP episodes for 95% of the patients.  Conclusions:   This study demonstrated a high prevalence of BTcP prevalence in cancer patients undergoing pelvic 3D radiotherapy and with proctalgia. Although the variables determining the onset of BTcP are still unclear, our results could help in the design of future clinical studies addressing the treatment of BTcP in these patients.""","""['V T Ferrero', 'M M Oset', 'J P Masferrer', 'E H Pardo', 'E J Sorolla', 'S C Largo;PrevaDIOR Study Group']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Clin Transl Oncol""","""['Effectiveness of fentanyl pectin nasal citrate in controlling episodes of breakthrough cancer pain triggered by routine radiotherapy procedures.', 'A Korean Nationwide Survey for Breakthrough Cancer Pain in an Inpatient Setting.', 'Breakthrough pain in patients with head & neck cancer.

GSK3β has a unique specificity, with its primed substrates binding to the primed phosphate binding site, which is critical for the catalytic activity of GSK3β. An L343R mutation located at the C-lobe of GSK3β, remote from the catalytic site, causes kinase inactivation. However, the detailed mechanism of this remains unclear. Here, microsecond molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and network analysis were performed to elucidate the allosteric inactivation of GSK3β triggered by the L343R mutation. Large-scale MD simulations of wild-type and the L343R mutant revealed that the L343R mutation caused disruption of the chemical environment near the mutation site, which propagated remotely to affect the conformational dynamics of the activation loop (A-loop). The resulting conformational rearrangement of the A-loop in the L343R mutant disrupted the primed phosphate binding site, thereby abrogating the catalytic activity of GSK3β. Furthermore, network analysis identified the allosteric pathway from R343 to the primed phosphate binding site in the L343R mutant. Collectively, the results of this study provide a mechanistic explanation of how the L343R mutation allosterically affects the functional activity of GSK3β, which contributes to our understanding of GSK3β biology.""","""['Jun Li', 'Qiang Fu', 'Yang Liang', 'Biao Cheng', 'Xiaolong Li']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""J Mol Model""","""['Structural basis for the complete loss of GSK3beta catalytic activity due to R96 mutation investigated by molecular dynamics study.', 'The structural basis of the autoinhibition mechanism of glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β): molecular modeling and molecular dynamics simulation studies.', 'Molecular modeling and molecular dynamics simulation studies of the GSK3β/ATP/substrate complex: understanding the unique P+4 primed phosphorylation specificity for GSK3β substrates.', 'Identifying Potential Ligand Binding Sites on Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 Using Atomistic Cosolvent Simulations.', 'Protein Allostery and Conformational Dynamics.', 'Application Fields, Positions, and Bioinformatic Mining of Non-active Sites: A Mini-Review.']"""

However, due to severe artifacts, the CBCTs are primarily used for verifying patient setup only so far. We have developed a learning-based image quality improvement method which could provide CBCTs with image quality comparable to planning CTs (pCTs). The accuracy of dose calculations based on these CBCTs is unknown. In this study, we aim to investigate the dosimetric accuracy of our corrected CBCT (CCBCT) in brain stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) and pelvic radiotherapy.  Materials and methods:   We retrospectively investigated a total of 32 treatment plans from 22 patients, each of whom with both original treatment pCTs and CBCTs acquired during treatment setup. The CCBCT and original CBCT (OCBCT) were registered to the pCT for generating CCBCT-based and OCBCT-based treatment plans. The original pCT-based plans served as ground truth. Clinically-relevant dose volume histogram (DVH) metrics were extracted from the ground truth, OCBCT-based and CCBCT-based plans for comparison. Gamma analysis was also performed to compare the absorbed dose distributions between the pCT-based and OCBCT/CCBCT-based plans of each patient.  Results:   CCBCTs demonstrated better image contrast and more accurate HU ranges when compared side-by-side with OCBCTs. For pelvic radiotherapy plans, the mean dose error in DVH metrics for planning target volume (PTV), bladder and rectum was significantly reduced, from 1% to 0.3%, after CBCT correction. The gamma analysis showed the average pass rate increased from 94.5% before correction to 99.0% after correction. For brain SRS treatment plans, both original and corrected CBCT images were accurate enough for dose calculation, though CCBCT featured higher image quality.  Conclusion:   CCBCTs can provide a level of dose accuracy comparable to traditional pCTs for brain and prostate radiotherapy planning and the correction method proposed here can be useful in CBCT-guided adaptive radiotherapy.""","""['Tonghe Wang', 'Yang Lei', 'Nivedh Manohar', 'Sibo Tian', 'Ashesh B Jani', 'Hui-Kuo Shu', 'Kristin Higgins', 'Anees Dhabaan', 'Pretesh Patel', 'Xiangyang Tang', 'Tian Liu', 'Walter J Curran', 'Xiaofeng Yang']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Med Dosim""","""['MRI-based treatment planning for brain stereotactic radiosurgery: Dosimetric validation of a learning-based pseudo-CT generation method.', 'Dose evaluation of MRI-based synthetic CT generated using a machine learning method for prostate cancer radiotherapy.', ""Correction for 'artificial' electron disequilibrium due to cone-beam CT density errors: implications for on-line adaptive stereotactic body radiation therapy of lung."", 'A review of dose calculation approaches with cone beam CT in photon and proton therapy.', 'Deep learning methods for enhancing cone-beam CT image quality toward adaptive radiation therapy: A systematic review.', 'Evaluation of Dose Calculation Based on Cone-Beam CT Using Different Measuring Correction Methods for Head and Neck Cancer Patients.', 'Deep learning-based thoracic CBCT correction with histogram matching.', 'A Deep Unsupervised Learning Model for Artifact Correction of Pelvis Cone-Beam CT.', 'Knowledge-based radiation treatment planning: A data-driven method survey.', 'A review of deep learning based methods for medical image multi-organ segmentation.']"""

The tracking or localization involves simulation of the MRI artifact in combination with a template matching algorithm. Simulations of the MRI artifacts induced by an HDR brachytherapy source and a titanium needle were implemented for four types of sequences: spoiled gradient echo, spin echo, balanced steady-state free precession (bSSFP) and bSSFP with spectral attenuated inversion recovery (SPAIR) fat suppression. A phantom study was conducted in which mentioned sequences (in 2D) as well as the volumetric MRI sequences of the current clinical scan protocol were applied to obtain the induced MRI artifacts for an HDR source and a titanium needle. Localization of the objects was performed by a phase correlation based template matching algorithm. The simulated images demonstrated high correspondences with the acquired MR images, and allowed localization of the objects. A comparison between the object positions obtained for all applied MRI sequences showed deviations (from the average position) of 0.2-0.3 mm, proving that all MRI sequences were suitable for localization of the objects, irrespective of their 2D or volumetric nature. This study demonstrated that the MRI artifact induced by an HDR source or a titanium needle could be simulated for the four investigated types of MRI sequences (spoiled gradient echo, spin echo, bSSFP and bSSFP-SPAIR), valuable for real-time object localization in clinical practice. This leads to more flexibility in the choice of MRI sequences for guidance of HDR brachytherapy, as they are suitable for both object localization and anatomy visualization.""","""['Ellis Beld', 'Marinus A Moerland', 'Jochem R N van der Voort van Zyp', 'Max A Viergever', 'Jan J W Lagendijk', 'Peter R Seevinck']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Phys Med Biol""","""['Visualization of gold fiducial markers in the prostate using phase-cycled bSSFP imaging for MRI-only radiotherapy.', 'MR-based source localization for MR-guided HDR brachytherapy.', 'Development and Testing of a Magnetic Resonance (MR) Conditional Afterloader for Source Tracking in Magnetic Resonance Imaging-Guided High-Dose-Rate (HDR) Brachytherapy.', 'Clinical evaluation of an MRI-to-ultrasound deformable image registration algorithm for prostate brachytherapy.', 'Use of three-dimensional radiation therapy planning tools and intraoperative ultrasound to evaluate high dose rate prostate brachytherapy implants.', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging Artifact Elimination in the Diagnosis of Female Pelvic Abscess under Phase Correction Algorithm.']"""

Morphologic and immunophenotypic overlap with high-grade neuroendocrine carcinoma was seen in half of the bladder tumors, which included 4 rhabdomyosarcomas and 2 sarcomatoid rhabdomyosarcomas. RNA sequencing confirmed expression of neuroendocrine markers in these cases (2 rhabdomyosarcomas and 2 sarcomatoid rhabdomyosarcomas). Differential neuroendocrine differentiation was highlighted by ASCL1 protein expression only in high-grade neuroendocrine carcinoma. Moreover, both a pure alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma and sarcomatoid rhabdomyosarcoma of the urinary bladder demonstrated a fusion involving PPP1R12A. In summary, adult rhabdomyosarcomas of the urinary bladder are molecularly distinct from high-grade neuroendocrine carcinomas based on specific patterns of expression of myogenic and epithelial to mesenchymal transition-related transcription factors as well as the presence of a novel PPP1R12A fusion which is seen in a subset of cases.""","""['Sounak Gupta', 'Carlos P Sosa', 'Farhad Kosari', 'Andrew Folpe', 'Kaustubh N Bhinge', 'Lin Yang', 'Alireza Agahi', 'Sarah H Johnson', 'Igor Frank', 'Stephen A Boorjian', 'Donna E Hansel', 'Hikmat A Al-Ahmadie', 'Victor E Reuter', 'George Vasmatzis', 'Rafael E Jimenez', 'Loren Herrera-Hernandez', 'John C Cheville']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Hum Pathol""","""['Rhabdomyosarcoma of the urinary bladder in adults: predilection for alveolar morphology with anaplasia and significant morphologic overlap with small cell carcinoma.', 'Aberrant expression of epithelial and neuroendocrine markers in alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma: a potentially serious diagnostic pitfall.', 'Adult urinary bladder tumors with rhabdomyosarcomatous differentiation: clinical, pathological and immunohistochemical studies.', 'Non-urothelial tumors of the urinary tract.', '""Pure"" primary large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma of the urinary bladder: case report, literature review and diagnostic criteria.', 'Introducing Fluorescence-Guided Surgery for Pediatric Ewing, Osteo-, and Rhabdomyosarcomas: A Literature Review.']"""

For quantitative analyses of H2S-releasing characteristics of the various donors, we evaluated four parameters, maximum concentration of H2S at the steady state (Cmax), the time required to reach half of Cmax (t1/2), maximum releasing rate of H2S (Rmax), and time at H2S (tr-max). The results showed that the H2S-releasing kinetics of each H2S donor were dependent on the type of assay solution. In particular, the addition of GSH to DATS in GM released the fastest and highest amounts of H2S among the four H2S donors in the following order: DATS > DADS > Na2S ~ NaHS. The H2S-releasing characteristics of the H2S donors were well-matched with cell viability results of human prostate cancer PC-3 cells.

Patients and methods:   In this multicentre phase III trial, patients were randomly assigned to ADT alone or ADT+EBRT. Leuprorelin 11.25 mg was administered for 3 years. The whole pelvis was treated at a dose of 46 Gy and the prostate with a boost from 20 to 28 Gy. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS). Secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS), disease-specific survival (DSS), locoregional PFS (LRPFS), metastasis-free survival (MFS), biochemical PFS (BPFS), and tolerance.  Results:   With a median follow-up of 7.3 years, 263 patients were included.

Standard infection control measures are required to prevent the onset of infection but, under some circumstances, antimicrobial prophylaxis is necessary. We have developed a family of innovative metallo-antibiotics of general formula [Cu(N,N)(CipA)Cl] where N,N represents a phenanthrene ligand and CipA stands for a derivative of the clinically used fluoroquinolone antibiotic ciprofloxacin. The X-ray crystal structure of one member from this family, [Cu(phen)(CipA)Cl] (where phen is 1,10-phenanthroline), is also reported. These complexes combine into one drug entity a Cu-N,N-framework with DNA binding and DNA oxidant properties and an antibiotic derivative with known anti-proliferative and anti-microbial activities. The complexes were all found to exhibit excellent DNA recognition with binding affinity of lead agents in the order of ∼107 M(bp)-1. Biophysical studies involving calf thymus DNA indicate the complexes intercalate or semi-intercalate DNA via the minor groove. All complexes exhibited excellent nuclease activity with DNA strand scission being mediated predominantly via superoxide and hydroxyl radicals. The complexes were found to have promising anti-proliferative effects against a human breast adenocarcinoma cell line (MCF-7) and a human prostate carcinoma cell line (DU145) with low micromolar and, in some cases, nanomolar cytotoxicities observed. Selective targeting of Gram positive bacteria was also identified by this complex class with one lead compound having an order of magnitude greater potency against Methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) as compared to the CipA ligand.

Materials and methods:   Fifty patients with biopsy-proven prostate cancer from 5 institutions underwent a standardized preoperative mpMRI protocol. Based on the evaluation of whole-mount histopathology sections, regions of interest were placed on axial T2-weighed MRI scans in cancer and noncancer peripheral zone (PZ) and transition zone (TZ) tissue. Regions of interest were transferred to functional parameter maps, and quantitative parameters were extracted. Across-center variations in noncancer tissues, differences between tissues, and the relation to cancer grade groups were assessed using linear mixed-effects models and receiver operating characteristic analyses.  Results:   Variations in quantitative parameters were low across institutes (mean [maximum] proportion of total variance in PZ and TZ, 4% [14%] and 8% [46%], respectively). Cancer and noncancer tissues were best separated using the diffusion-weighted imaging-derived apparent diffusion coefficient, both in PZ and TZ (mean [95% confidence interval] areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUCs]; 0.93 [0.89-0.96] and 0.86 [0.75-0.94]), followed by MR spectroscopic imaging and dynamic contrast-enhanced-derived parameters. Parameters from all imaging methods correlated significantly with tumor grade group in PZ tumors. In discriminating GG1 PZ tumors from higher GGs, the highest AUC was obtained with apparent diffusion coefficient (0.74 [0.57-0.90], P < 0.001).

Methods:   The feasibility of using CBCT images obtained using a Siemens Arcadis Orbic 3D mobile C-arm was evaluated. A retrospective clinical study was undertaken of six participants undergoing HDR prostate brachytherapy. Plans generated using images from a Toshiba Aquilion One LB CT were compared with those generated using CBCT images. After rigid spatial registration, the plans were compared based on various parameters such as dose-volume histograms, overlap quantities and metrics, and dose constraints.  Results:   Provided they were within the limited field of view, the brachytherapy catheters and fiducial markers were clearly visible in the CBCT images and thus, localisable and identifiable in the treatment planning process. The Siemens CBCT underestimated CT numbers leading to poorer tissue contrast which exacerbated the difficulties in delineation of the target tumour and the surrounding organs at risk. Between CT- and CBCT-based plans, the mean difference of CTV-D90 was 1.58 Gy, CTV-V100 was 12.13%, rectum-V80 was 0.06% and urethra-V120 was -0.70%.  Conclusion:   It was not feasible to solely utilise the Siemens Arcadis Orbic 3D for HDR prostate brachytherapy treatment planning due to suboptimal organ delineation.

We compared the initial cancer treatment and cancer-specific mortality of SEER-Medicare patients with locoregional high-grade (nonmetastatic) prostate cancer with and without preexisting SMI.  Methods:   We identified SEER-Medicare patients who were 67 years of age or older diagnosed between 2006 and 2013 with locoregional high-grade (nonmetastatic) prostate cancer. Preexisting SMI was identified by claims indicative of bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and other psychotic disorder, during the 2 years before cancer diagnosis. We used multivariable binary logistic regression to examine associations between SMI and receipt of surgery or radiation concurrent with hormone therapy (definitive initial treatment) within 1 year after cancer diagnosis. We used Kaplan-Meier survival curves, as well as Cox proportional hazards and competing risk models to evaluate unadjusted and adjusted associations between SMI and 5-year cancer-specific survival.  Results:   Among 49 985 patients with locoregional high-grade (nonmetastatic) prostate cancer, 523 (1.1%) had SMI and 49 462 (98.9%) had no SMI.

In addition, gain-of-function and loss-of-function studies showed that overexpression of SNHG12 promoted, while downregulation suppressed the proliferation, invasion, and migration of PCa cells in vitro. Knockdown of SNHG12 also repressed PCa xenograft tumor growth in vivo. Further in-depth mechanistic studies showed that SNHG12 might serve as a competing endogenous RNA for miR-195 in PCa cells, and miR-195 expression level was negatively associated with the expression of SNHG12 in PCa tissues. Finally, we found that the activity of Wnt/β-catenin signaling is enhanced by SNHG12 overexpression and rescued by co-transfection with miR-195 mimics in PCa cells.

G. Don (C. roseus) is a well-known medicinal plant for its source of alkaloids solely found in the leaves. Other parts including the root are usually discarded after the alkaloid extraction. This study sought to investigate phytochemical profiles, antioxidant, antimicrobial and cytotoxic properties of the C. roseus root extract (RE) and its two sub-fractions including saponin-enriched (SE) and aqueous (AQ) fractions. The results showed that the RE was a rich source of saponins (1744.44 mg ESE/g) and phenolics (51.27 mg GAE/g), which comprised of gallic acid (25.74 mg/g), apigenin (1.45 mg/g) and kaempferol (1.58 mg/g). The SE fraction was enriched with 31% of saponins and 63% of phenolics higher than those of the RE; whereas the concentrations of saponins and phenolics of the AQ fraction were lower than those of the RE by 40% and 74%, respectively. The content of gallic acid in the SE fraction was 1.4-fold and 1.5-fold higher than those of the RE or AQ fraction, respectively. The SE fraction demonstrated potent antioxidant capacity, which was significantly higher than the RE or AQ fraction, and also exhibited strong anti-proliferative activity against 11 cancer cell lines including A2780 (ovarian), H460 (lung), A431 (skin), MIA PaCa-2 (pancreas), Du145 (prostate), HT29 (colon), MCF-7 (breast), BE2-C (neuroblastoma), SJ-G2, U87 and SMA (glioblastoma) with low GI50 values (≤ 2.00 µg/mL). The SE fraction was also shown to effectively inhibit the growth of both bacteria (Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes and Staphylococccus lugdunensis) and fungi (Candida albicans and Aspergillus niger).

A human tissue microarray containing samples from 71 patients with PCa and seven healthy donors was employed for immunohistochemistry (IHC). The clinicopathological characteristics and prognostic value of MBTD1 were investigated using a dataset of 499 patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). IHC illustrated that the levels of MBTD1 protein were enhanced and markedly associated with aggressive clinical stage and advanced tumor invasion, distant metastasis and lymph node metastasis in patients with PCa. In the TCGA data set, the level of MBTD1 was found to positively correlate with the prostate-specific antigen level, Gleason score and distant metastasis. The multivariate analysis of Cox regression revealed that the levels of MBTD1 may act as an independent prognostic factor for low non-biochemical, recurrence-free survival.

In combination with chemotherapeutic drugs, MET reduces the dosage of chemotherapeutic drugs required and enhances anticancer efficacy. In the present study, the combination of MET and paclitaxel (PTX) in three human prostate cancer (PCa) cell lines (22RV1, PC-3 and LNCaP) was evaluated to investigate the effects on proliferation and apoptosis of PCa cells. The present study explored whether their effects were associated with reactive oxygen species (ROS). An MTT assay and microscopy were used to study the effect of MET + PTX on cell growth. Half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) values were obtained for MET (12.281±1.089 mM for 22RV1, 2.248±0.352 mM for PC-3 cells and 3.610±0.577 mM for LNCaP cells) and PTX (13.170±1.12 nM for PC-3 cells) at 48 h. Since the survival rate of 22RV1 and LNCaP cells did not decrease linearly with increasing PTX concentration, it is difficult to estimate accurate IC50; therefore, only IC50 values for PTX in PC-3 cells were given. When treating the cells with 5 mM MET, the IC50 of PTX decreased to 5.423±0.734 nM for PC-3 cells. Annexin V and propidium iodide staining was used to investigate apoptosis by flow cytometry. The apoptotic mechanisms of MET + PTX in PCa were investigated by detecting the expression of apoptosis-related proteins, activities of caspase-3/7, intracellular ROS accumulation, mitochondrial membrane potential, and intracellular levels of adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP). MET + PTX induced PCa apoptosis and ROS accumulation, and decreased mitochondrial membrane potential and intracellular levels of ATP. Taken together, these results indicated that MET + PTX suppressed PCa cell proliferation in a dose- and time-dependent manner. In addition, MET + PTX induced apoptosis by increasing ROS levels, reducing mitochondrial membrane potential, and activating mitochondrial-dependent apoptotic pathways.""","""['Yuwan Zhao', 'Xin Zeng', 'Huancheng Tang', 'Dongcai Ye', 'Jianjun Liu']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Oncol Lett""","""['Paclitaxel Induces the Apoptosis of Prostate Cancer Cells via ROS-Mediated HIF-1α Expression.', 'Glaucarubinone sensitizes KB cells to paclitaxel by inhibiting ABC transporters via ROS-dependent and p53-mediated activation of apoptotic signaling pathways.', 'Zinc promotes prostate cancer cell chemosensitivity to paclitaxel by inhibiting epithelial-mesenchymal transition and inducing apoptosis.', 'Synergistic Effect of Graphene Oxide Coated Nanotised Apigenin with Paclitaxel (GO-NA/PTX): A ROS Dependent Mitochondrial Mediated Apoptosis in Ovarian Cancer.', 'Blockade of paclitaxel-induced thymidine phosphorylase expression can accelerate apoptosis in human prostate cancer cells.', 'Cysteine depletion sensitizes prostate cancer cells to agents that enhance DNA damage and to immune checkpoint inhibition.', 'Paclitaxel Induces the Apoptosis of Prostate Cancer Cells via ROS-Mediated HIF-1α Expression.', 'Metformin regulates multiple signaling pathways within castration-resistant human prostate cancer cells.', 'Mechanisms of cancer cell death induction by paclitaxel: an updated review.', 'Metformin and Cancer Hallmarks: Molecular Mechanisms in Thyroid, Prostate and Head and Neck Cancer Models.']"""

This study assessed the direct economic burden that out-of-pocket (OOP) payments cause and explored how they and financial difficulties are associated with HRQoL. Methods: This is a cross-sectional registry and survey study of 1978 cancer patients having either prostate (630), breast (840) or colorectal cancer (508) treated in Finland. The patients were divided into five groups according to the stage of their disease: primary treatment, rehabilitation, remission, metastatic disease and palliative care. The cost data and OOP payments were retrieved from primary and secondary healthcare registries, the Social Insurance Institution of Finland, and a patient questionnaire. HRQoL was measured by 15D, EQ-5D-3L and by EORTC-QLQ-C30. Financial difficulties were evaluated based on patients' self-assessment in the EORTC-QLQ-C30 four-level question about financial difficulties. A path analysis was used to explore the relationship between clinical and demographic factors, HRQoL, OOP payments and financial difficulties. Results: The highest OOP payments were caused by outpatient medication. Total costs and OOP payments were highest in the palliative care group in which the OOP payments consisted mostly of outpatient medication and public sector specialist care. Private sector health care was an important item of OOP payments in the early stages of cancer. Financial difficulties increased together with OOP payments. HRQoL deteriorated the more a person had financial difficulties. In the path analysis, financial difficulties had a major negative direct and total effect on the HRQoL. Factors that attenuated financial difficulties were age, cohabiting and higher education and factors that increased them were OOP payments, total costs of healthcare use, and unemployment. Conclusions: High OOP payments are related to financial difficulties, which have a negative effect on HRQoL. Outpatient medication was a major driver of OOP payments. Among palliative patients, the economic burden was highest and associated with impaired HRQoL.""","""['Jyri-Pekka Koskinen', 'Niilo Färkkilä', 'Harri Sintonen', 'Tiina Saarto', 'Kimmo Taari', 'Risto P Roine']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Acta Oncol""","""['Health-related quality of life in colorectal cancer.', 'Health-related quality of life among breast, prostate, and colorectal cancer patients with end-stage disease.', 'Health-related quality of life in different states of breast cancer - comparing different instruments.', 'Patient out-of-pocket spending in cranial neurosurgery: single-institution analysis of 6569 consecutive cases and literature review.', 'Does cost sharing do more harm or more good? - a systematic literature review.', 'Evaluation of the Predictors of the Quality of Life in the Postpartum Period: A Cross-Sectional Study.', 'Out-of-pocket costs sustained in the last 12\xa0months by cancer patients: an Italian survey-based study on individual expenses between 2017 and 2018.', 'The Cost of Breast Cancer Surgery - Is the Money Spent Reflected on Health-related Quality of Life?', 'Financial toxicity in cancer patients treated with radiotherapy in Germany-a\xa0cross-sectional study.', 'Patient-Reported Financial Distress in Cancer: A Systematic Review of Risk Factors in Universal Healthcare Systems.']"""

We showed that Cat L and CUX1 were highly expressed in TNBC patient tissue/cell lines, as compared to ER-positive samples, using cBioportal data and western blot/zymography analyses. Additionally, luciferase reporter and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays showed that CUX1 directly bound to estrogen receptor-alpha (ER-α) promoter in MDA-MB-468, a representative TNBC cell line, and that CUX1 siRNA could restore ER-α transcription and protein expression. Furthermore, Snail and CUX1 expression in various TNBC cell lines was inhibited by muscadine grape skin extract (MSKE, a natural grape product rich in anthocyanins) or Cat L inhibitor (Z-FY-CHO) leading to decreased cell invasion and migration. MSKE decreased cell viability and increased expression of apoptotic markers in MDA-MB-468 cells, with no effect on non-tumorigenic MCF10A cells.

Identification of specific GP features may aid diagnosis. We aimed to evaluate the multiparametric MRI (mpMRI) features of GP.  Methods:   We retrospectively reviewed 16 patients from a cohort undergoing mpMRI and transperineal sector-guided prostate biopsies between July 2012 and May 2017. Images were analysed for lesion location, shape, size, extracapsular extension, signal intensity (SI), apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values, dynamic contrast enhancement (DCE) pattern and PI-RADS (Prostate Imaging - Reporting and Data System) v2 score.  Results:   Histology revealed 13 cases of nonspecific GP and 3 cases of xanthogranulomatous prostatitis. GP lesions were diffuse involving > 50% of the prostate ( n = 13) or nodular ( n = 3). Signal intensity on T 2 weighted imaging was low and high on diffusion-weighted imaging. ADC values were low (mean 702 ± 79 × 10-6 mm/s2 ). Five patients had DCE imaging with all cases 'positive' as per PI-RADS scoring, with two cases displaying further ring enhancement consistent with abscess formation. Overall PI-RADS score for all cases was 5, indicating high suspicion of prostate cancer.  Conclusion:   GP is difficult to differentiate from prostate cancer, but typically gives diffuse changes involving > 50% of the gland on mpMRI, with extracapsular extension and rim-enhancing areas. It should be considered a differential diagnosis in patients with recent urinary tract infection (UTI) or prior Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) treatment.

Even though novel treatment modalities have been developed, it still a lifethreatening disease. Therefore novel compounds are needed to improve the overall survival.  Methods:   In our study, it was aimed to evaluate the anti-cancer activity of newly synthesized Platinum (II) [Pt(II)] complex on DU145, LNCaP and PC-3 prostate cancer cell lines. The cytotoxic activity of Pt(II) complex was tested by SRB and ATP cell viability assays. To detect the mode of cell death; fluorescent staining, flow cytometry and western blot analyses were performed.  Results:   The Pt(II) complex treatment resulted in a decrease in cell viability and increasing levels of apoptotic markers (pyknotic nuclei, annexin-V, caspase 3/7 activity) and a decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential in a dose dependent manner. Among cell types, tested PC-3 cells were found to be more sensitive to Pt(II) complex, demonstrating elevation of DNA damage in this cell line. In addition, Pt(II) complex induced Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) stress by triggering ROS generation. More importantly, pre-treatment with NAC alleviated Pt(II) complex-mediated ER stress and cell death in PC-3.

In this study, we aimed to reveal functional lncRNAs and identify prognosis-related RNAs in PCa by analyzing data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). To achieve this, an lncRNA-mRNA coexpression network was constructed by weighted correlation network analysis. Additionally, a subnetwork was extracted from this weighted correlation network, and seven lncRNAs were identified as core nodes. Further Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed that three lncRNAs (LINC00683, LINC00857, and FENDRR) were significantly downregulated in PCa samples, and there was a strong positive correlation with patient survival. Importantly, LINC00683 has not been fully reported as related with PCa. Additionally, gene set enrichment analysis indicated that LINC00683 might be involved in cancer-related pathways such as the Wnt pathway.

However, the acquisition of androgen ablation therapy resistance remains a challenge. Recently, androgen receptor splicing variants lacking the ligand-binding domain have been reported to play a critical role in the acquisition of androgen ablation therapy resistance. In the present study, we revealed that the messenger RNA expression and the protein levels of an androgen receptor variant 7 (AR-V7) were higher in prostate cancer tissue samples and in the AR-positive prostate cancer cell line, VCaP. In contrast, microRNA (miR)-30c-1-3p/miR-103a-2-5p expression was significantly downregulated in tumor tissues and cells. miR-30c-1-3p/miR-103a-2-5p overexpression could inhibit AR-V7 expression, suppress VCaP cell growth, and inhibit AR-V7 downstream factor expression by directly targeting the 3'-untranslated region of AR-V7. Under enzalutamide (Enza) treatment, the effects of AR-V7 overexpression were the opposite of those of miR-103a-2-5p/miR-30c-1-3p overexpression; more importantly, the effects of miR-103a-2-5p/miR-30c-1-3p overexpression could be significantly reversed by AR-V7 overexpression under Enza.

The profiles of 111 In-SB9 and 111 In-AMBA were directly compared in PC-3 cells and tumor-bearing mice. SB9 and AMBA displayed high GRPR affinities. 111 In-AMBA strongly internalized in PC-3 cells, while 111 In-SB9 remained bound on the cell surface showing a typical GRPR-radioantagonist profile. 111 In-SB9 was more stable than 111 In-AMBA, but coinjection of the neprilysin (NEP) inhibitor phosphoramidon (PA) stabilized both in vivo. The radioligands displayed high tumor uptake (20.23 ± 3.41 %ID/g and 18.53 ± 1.54 %ID/g, respectively, at 4 hours pi), but 111 In-SB9 washed faster from background. PA coinjection led to significant increase of tumor uptake, combined with better clearance for 111 In-SB9.

So, we studied the effects of DDR1 inhibition on EMT as well as induction of cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis in prostate cancer cell lines. DDR1 expression was evaluated using reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction and western blot analysis. The EMT-associated protein expression was determined using the western blot analysis and immunocytochemistry following treatment with various concentrations of DDR1 inhibitor. The activation of DDR1 and also downstream-signaling molecules Pyk2 and MKK7 were determined using western blot analysis. Cell survival and proliferation after DDR1 inhibition were evaluated using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazole-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide, bromodeoxyuridine, and colony formation assays. Flow cytometry analysis was used to determine the effects of DDR1 inhibition on cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis using annexin V/propidium iodide-based flow cytometry. Results showed that the protein expression of N-cadherin and vimentin were decreased whereas protein expression of E-cadherin was increased after DDR1 inhibition. Results of our western blot analysis indicated that DDR1 inhibitor effectively downregulated P-DDR1, P-Pyk2, and P-MKK7 levels. This result also showed that DDR1 inhibition decreased cell survival and proliferation, induced G1 cell-cycle arrest, induced apoptosis by an increase in the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio and depletion of the mitochondrial membrane potential, and also by reactive oxygen species creation in prostate cancer cells. These data show that DDR1 inhibition can result in the EMT prevention via inhibition of Pyk2 and MKK7 signaling pathway and induces cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis in prostate cancer cell lines.

Recreational physical activity performed over the lifetime showed no association with prostate cancer risk. Weight training performed from early adulthood onwards showed a non-significant but consistent inverse association with prostate cancer risk. There was no strong evidence that physical activity was differentially associated with the risks of low-grade and medium-to-high grade prostate cancers.  Conclusions:   A high level of vigorous recreational physical activity in early adulthood may be required to reduce the risk of prostate cancer.""","""['Elizabeth Sorial', 'Si Si', 'Lin Fritschi', 'Ellie Darcey', 'Justine E Leavy', 'Jennifer Girschik', 'Gina L Ambrosini', 'Terry Boyle']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Cancer Causes Control""","""['Case-control study of lifetime total physical activity and prostate cancer risk.', 'Recreational physical activity and risk of prostate cancer in a large cohort of U.S. men.', 'Case-control study of lifetime occupational and recreational physical activity and risks of colon and rectal cancer.', 'Moderate-vigorous recreational physical activity and breast cancer risk, stratified by menopause status: a systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Does physical activity reduce the risk of prostate cancer?

Materials and methods:   One hundred and seventy-three men (mean age, 68 ± 7.7 years; range 46-84 years) with newly diagnosed, untreated PC were enrolled in this prospective study between January 2017 and August 2018. All patients underwent a 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT examination. For each patient, we determined the disease stage, the Gleason score, and the maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) for primary prostatic tumor and extraprostatic metastases. The diagnostic sensitivity and interobserver agreement of 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT for diagnosis and staging of PC were established by histopathology as the reference standard.  Results: 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT examinations were interpreted as positive for PC in 166 of 173 patients (101 patients had primary prostatic tumor only, two patients had extraprostatic metastases only and 63 patients had combined lesions). The sensitivity of 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT examination in the diagnosis of PC was 96%. 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT produced a significant change of stage in 28.6% patients with an upstage in 17.9% patients and a downstage in 10.7% patients. The interobserver agreements were almost good to perfect (k = 0.63-0.89) for visual image interpretation, SUVmax measurement, and tumor staging.

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common type of liver cancer. miR-1-3p plays important roles in cancer, including prostate, bladder, lung cancer, and colorectal carcinoma. The function of miR-1-3p in HCC remains poorly understood.  Methods:   qRT-PCR was performed to detect the miR-1-3p expression in HCC cell lines (HCCLM3, Hep3B, Bel-7404, SMMC-7721) and the normal human hepatic cell line (LO2). HCCLM3 and Bel-7404 cells were transfected with miR-1-3p mimic or scramble control followed by water-soluble tetrazolium salt (WST-1) assay. Western bolt analysis was performed to determine the protein levels. TargetScan7.1 (http://www.targetscan.org/vert_71/) was used to predict the potential targets of miR-1-3p. SRY (sex determining region Y)-box 9 (SOX9), which has been previously shown to play an important role in HCC, was found to be a target of miR-1-3p. Luciferase reporter assay was used to explore the targeting of miR-1-3p on SOX9. For in vivo tumorigenesis assay, HCCLM3 cells with stable overexpression of miR-1-3p or control plasmid were injected subcutaneously into the flank of the SCID mice and animals were monitored for tumor growth.  Results:   miR-1-3p was significantly downregulated in HCC cell lines (HCCLM3, Hep3B, Bel-7404, and SMMC-7721) compared to normal human hepatic cell line (LO2). Overexpression of miR-1-3p significantly inhibited the proliferation and induced apoptosis in HCCLM3 and Bel-7474 cells. SOX9 was a direct target of miR-1-3p in HCC cells. Inhibition of SOX9 significantly inhibited the proliferation of HCCLM3 and Bel-7474 cells. In vivo, overexpression of miR-1-3p decreased tumor volume in a xenograft model.  Conclusion:   These results highlight the role of miR-1-3p in HCC. Overexpression of miR-1-3P inhibited the proliferation of HCC at least partly due to the regulation of SOX9. miR-1-3p may be a promising therapeutic candidate for HCC.""","""['Hao Zhang', 'Zhenya Zhang', 'Lili Gao', 'Zhengdong Qiao', 'Minghua Yu', 'Bo Yu', 'Tao Yang']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Onco Targets Ther""","""['miR-1307-3p promotes tumor growth and metastasis of hepatocellular carcinoma by repressing DAB2 interacting protein.', 'LINC00052/miR-101-3p axis inhibits cell proliferation and metastasis by targeting SOX9 in hepatocellular carcinoma.', 'MiR-331-3p Inhibition of the Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) Bel-7402 Cell Line by Down-Regulation of E2F1.', 'miR-138 suppresses cell proliferation and invasion by inhibiting SOX9 in hepatocellular carcinoma.', 'MiR-128-3p suppresses tumor proliferation and metastasis via targeting CDC6 in hepatocellular carcinoma cells.', 'Coinfection of Dermal Fibroblasts by Human Cytomegalovirus and Human Herpesvirus 6 Can Boost the Expression of Fibrosis-Associated MicroRNAs.', 'Network-based approach for targeting human kinases commonly associated with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and cancer.', 'Thymoquinone Suppresses Angiogenesis in DEN-Induced Hepatocellular Carcinoma by Targeting miR-1-3p.', 'MicroRNA-dependent suppression of biological pacemaker activity induced by TBX18.', 'Comprehensive bioinformatics analysis to identify a novel cuproptosis-related prognostic signature and its ceRNA regulatory axis and candidate traditional Chinese medicine active ingredients in lung adenocarcinoma.']"""

We sought to investigate regulatory mechanisms that result in increased therapeutic resistance, which is associated with neuroendocrine differentiation of prostate cancer and linked to dysregulation of the androgen-responsive pathway.  Experimental design:   The underlying intracellular mechanism that sustains the oncogenic network involved in neuroendocrine differentiation and therapeutic resistance of prostate cancer was evaluated to investigate and identify effectors. Multiple sets of samples with prostate adenocarcinomas and CRPC were assessed via IHC and other assays.  Results:   We demonstrated that leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) was induced by androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) and was upregulated by ZBTB46 in prostate cancer to promote CRPC and neuroendocrine differentiation. LIF was found to be induced in patients with prostate cancer after ADT and was associated with enriched nuclear ZBTB46 staining in high-grade prostate tumors. In prostate cancer cells, high ZBTB46 output was responsible for the activation of LIF-STAT3 signaling and neuroendocrine-like features. The abundance of LIF was mediated by ADT-induced ZBTB46 through a physical interaction with the regulatory sequence of LIF. Analysis of serum from patients showed that cases of higher tumor grade and metastatic prostate cancer exhibited higher LIF titers.

Methods:   Study subjects included men with initial PSA between 4.0 and 10.0 ng/ml that have undergone 12-core TRUS-guided prostate biopsy between 2009 and 2016. The prostate cancer detection rate was calculated, while potential factors associated with detection were investigated via univariable and multivariable analysis.  Results:   A total of 617 men from a multi-ethnic background encompassing Chinese (63.5%), Malay (23.1%) and Indian (13.3%) were studied. The overall cancer detection rate was 14.3% (88/617), which included cancers detected at biopsy 1 (first biopsy), biopsy 2 (second biopsy with previous negative biopsy) and biopsy ≥ 3 (third or more biopsies with prior negative biopsies). Indian men displayed higher detection rate (23.2%) and increased risk of prostate cancer development (OR 1.85, 95% CI 1.03-3.32, p < 0.05), compared to their Malay (9.8%) and Chinese (14.0%) counterparts. Multivariable analysis revealed that ethnicity and PSA density (PSAD) are independent factors associated with overall prostate cancer detection rate. A unit increase of PSAD reflected an increase in PSA after controlling for prostate volume.  Conclusion:   Prostate cancer detection in Malaysia is comparatively lower.

Materials and methods:   The magnetic susceptibilities for gold fiducial markers and brachytherapy seeds differ in magnitude and also in their signs, resulting in B0-field inhomogeneity patterns with opposite main lobes. A pulse sequence used to localize brachytherapy seeds with positive contrast, centre-out radial sampling with off-resonance reception (co-RASOR), was used to reconstruct images with a range of off-resonant frequency offsets. The proposed method utilizes two frequency filters to selectively reconstruct maximum intensity projections through band-pass regions where each seed has its maximal localized hyperintensity. Seeds were simulated and then placed in gel and tissue phantoms to validate the technique using orthogonal 2D slices with seeds both parallel and perpendicular to the B0-field.  Results:   Dual-plane 2D co-RASOR sequences were reconstructed off-resonance with applied frequency filters to create two projections displaying each seed, which were then colour-coded to negative and positive frequencies. Phantom validation showed that each seed contains its maximal CNR in opposing frequency regions as predicted. Local maxima can also appear in both negative and positive frequency regions. The relative difference between the signal of each seed and these local maxima ranged from 1.19 to 3.73, and an image threshold was determined in all cases. Tissue validation showed the technique differentiates seeds correctly and is limited by the hyperintensity patterns observed in the co-RASOR method.

Our own experience at calibrating BLI readout with tumor weight/volume in human prostate cancer xenograft models in haired, SCID-NSG mice through intraprostatic (orthotopic) and subcutaneous (SC) inoculations revealed either nonexistent or poor correlation (coefficient of determination, R 2 = ~0.01-0.3). The present work examined several technical and biological factors to improve BLI utility.  Methods:   After ruling out promoter-luciferase (luc) specificity and luc gene loss in the cell inoculum with LNCaP-AR-luc cells expressing an androgen receptor (AR) and tagged with AR-responsive probasin promoter-luc gene, we evaluated different routes of d-luciferin administration, imaging time during the day, charge-coupled device camera image acquisition settings, and hair removal methods to improve the imaging protocol. For most imaging sessions, BLI was carried out within the same day of tumor volume measurement. After necropsy, histological and immunohistochemical (IHC) analyses were performed on the tumors to evaluate necrosis and expression of luciferase and AR, respectively.  Results:   Injection of d-luciferin by SC route, robust image-capture setting (30 000 counts and autoexposure), imaging in the morning and thorough hair removal resulted in a substantial improvement of R2 to ~0.6. Histological analyses confirmed the lack of BLI signal in necrotic tumor masses consistent with luciferase-mediated light emission only in oxygenated adenosine triphosphate-producing viable cells. IHC staining detected heterogeneous expression of luciferase tracking generally with AR expression in nonnecrotic tumor tissues.  Conclusions:   Our body of work highlighted a framework to validate imaging protocols to ensure the acquisition of interpretable BLI data as an indicator of xenograft tumor burden.

We investigated whether circulating miRNAs in plasma could be used as diagnostic biomarkers for more aggressive prostate cancer at prostate biopsy.  Methods:   Men, aged 40 years and above, newly diagnosed with prostate cancer were categorized into two risk groups, low-grade (Gleason score, 6 or 7 [3 + 4] and serum prostate-specific antigen [PSA], <20 ng/mL) and high-grade (Gleason score, ≥7 (4 + 3) and serum PSA, ≥20 ng/mL) prostate cancers. The limma R package was used to compare the expression of miRNAs in plasma between the two risk groups, adjusting for age.  Results:   There were 66 men, aged 46-86 years, included: 40 men with low-grade and 26 men with high-grade prostate cancers. There were lower expressions of miR-28, miR-100, miR-942, and miR-28-3p, and higher expressions of miR-708, miR-1298, miR-886-3p, miR-374, miR-376c, miR-202, miR-128a, and miR-185 in high-grade compared to low-grade prostate cancer cases at biopsy, after adjusting for age (P < 0.05). These differences were no longer statistically significant after adjusting the P values for multiple comparisons.

Because checkpoint kinases (CHEKs) are known to play a role in progression through the G1 phase, we downregulated CHEK1, which did not overcome the G1 arrest induced by PrKD1. Using in vitro phosphorylation and Western blot assays, we showed that PrKD1 phosphorylates all CDC25 isoforms (known substrates of CHEK kinases), independent from CHEK kinases, suggesting that direct phosphorylation of CDC25 by PrKD1 may be an alternate mechanism of G1 arrest.

We evaluated the risk of prostate specific antigen recurrence in a large cohort of men who underwent radical prostatectomy after initial active surveillance.  Materials and methods:   The study included men who underwent radical prostatectomy after a period of active surveillance. At diagnosis the men had GG (Gleason Grade Group) 1 or 2, clinical T2 or less and low or intermediate risk disease. They were stratified by a composite variable of GG and the volume of high grade cores at diagnosis. Pathological characteristics and recurrence after radical prostatectomy were evaluated.  Results:   Of 1,916 men enrolled in active surveillance between 1994 and 2017, 448 (23.4%) underwent deferred radical prostatectomy. Median time to radical prostatectomy was 27 months (IQR 15.5-46.5). At diagnosis 388 men (86.6%) had GG1 disease, 31 (6.9%) had GG2 disease with 1 high grade core and 29 (6.5%) had GG2 disease with 2 or more high grade cores. GG2 with 2 or more high grade cores at diagnosis was associated with an increased risk of recurrence compared to GG1 disease (HR 3.29, 95% CI 1.49-7.26, p <0.01). GG2 disease with 1 high grade core did not significantly differ from GG1.  Conclusions:   Our results support the careful use of active surveillance in men with GG2 and 1 high grade core at diagnosis.

Methods:   Analysis of Australian Cancer Incidence and Mortality data published in 2017 by the AIHW. Age-standardised rates (ASR) for 1982 to 2014/2015. Piecewise linear regression was used to assess temporal trends. For the purposes of comparison, data were also extracted for all cancers with greater burdens of disease (lung, colorectal, breast, prostate, pancreatic, and brain cancers and melanoma of the skin).  Results:   Since 1982, the average annual percentage change (AAPC) for ASR incidence of liver cancer was 4.858% (95%CI 4.558-5.563). This marked a 306% increase from 1.822/100,000 persons (95%CI 1.586-2.058) in 1982 to 7.396/100,000 persons (95%CI 7.069-7.723) in 2014. AAPC for ASR mortality was 3.013% (95%CI 2.448-3.521): an increase of 184% from 2.323/100,000 persons (95%CI 2.052-2.594) in 1982 to 6.593/100,000 (95%CI 6.290-6.896) in 2015.

In comparison to the other selected cancers, higher AAPC for both incidence and mortality of liver cancer were observed.  Conclusion:   Incidence and mortality associated with liver cancer have increased substantially in the past three decades, in contrast to the improved outcomes observed for many other cancers.

Based on the backward selection, four variables were included in the final multivariable regression model, including the percentage of positive cores in preoperative biopsy, clinical stage, free prostate specific antigen (fPSA)/total PSA (tPSA), and age. A nomogram was developed using these four variables. The concordance index (C-index) of the nomogram was 0.722 in the development cohort and 0.700 in the bootstrap validations. The bias-corrected calibration plot showed a limited departure from the ideal line with a mean absolute error of 2.0%. In decision curve analyses, the nomogram showed net benefits in the range from 0.2 to 0.7.

Methods:   Eight clinical plans of varying complexity were optimized with the highest allowed MF on the Accuracy Precision treatment planning system. Using a central limit theorem argument a range of reduced MFs were then determined from the first two moments of the LOT distribution. A step down approach was used to calculate the reduced-MF plans and plan comparison tools available on the Precision treatment planning system were used to evaluate dose differences with the reference plan.  Results:   A reduced-MF plan that balanced delivery time and dosimetric quality was found from the set of five MFs determined from the LOT distribution of the reference plan. The reduced-MF plan showed good agreement with the reference plan (target and critical organ dose-volume region of interest dose differences were within 1% and 2% of prescription dose, respectively).  Discussion:   Plan evaluation and acceptance criteria can vary depending on individual clinical expectations and dosimetric quality trade-offs. With the scheme presented in this paper a planner should be able to efficiently generate a high-quality plan with efficient delivery time without knowing a good MF beforehand.  Conclusion:   A methodology for deriving a reduced MF from the LOT distribution of a high MF treatment plan using the central limit theorem has been presented. A scheme for finding a reduced MF from a set of MFs that results in a plan balanced in both dosimetric quality and treatment delivery efficiency has also been presented.""","""['Robert Boyd', 'Kyoungkeun Jeong', 'Wolfgang A Tomé']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""J Appl Clin Med Phys""","""['Treatment plan comparison between helical tomotherapy and MLC-based IMRT using radiobiological measures.', 'Evaluation of MLC leaf positioning accuracy for static and dynamic IMRT treatments using DAVID in vivo dosimetric system.', 'Incorporating geometric ray tracing to generate initial conditions for intensity modulated arc therapy optimization.', 'What is plan quality in radiotherapy?

Methods:   High-risk-locally advanced prostate cancer patients without distant metastases before radical prostatectomy (RP) were included. Adjuvant high-dose intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) with concurrent docetaxel and long-term androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT) were started after 3-6 months from RP. ADT was maintained for two years. Acute and late toxicity were evaluated with the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (v. 3.0). Biochemical and clinical recurrence-free survival were explored by using the Kaplan-Meier method.  Results:   Overall 42 patients were included. Acute genitourinary toxicity was observed with Grade I, II, and III in four (9.5%), two (4.8%), and one (2.3%) patients, respectively. Acute gastrointestinal toxicity was reported to be of Grade I and II in 12 (29.3%) and three (7.2%) patients, respectively. In these patients, concomitant genito-urinary and gastrointestinal toxicity occurred in three (7.2%) cases. A residual GU Grade I toxicity was present only in one patient. Toxicity due to CHT was found in four (9.5%) patients. Complete continence after RP and IMRT was achieved in 32 patients (76.2%). After a median follow-up of 3.4 years, BCR and clinical recurrence were observed in 16.7% and 9.5% of patients, respectively. A 5-year biochemical and clinical recurrence-free survival rate were 70.7% and 84.0%, respectively. Five-year overall survival was 93.6%.

The authors' group recently reported on the important role of centromere protein F (CENPF), a protein associated with the centromere-kinetochore complex and chromosomal segregation during mitosis, in PC MRI visibility. This study focuses on discerning the role of CENPF in metabolic perturbation in human PC3 cells. A series of bioinformatics analyses shows that CENPF is one gene that is strongly associated with aggressive PC and that its expression is positively correlated with metastasis. By identifying and reconstructing the CENPF network, additional associations with lipid regulation are found. Further untargeted metabolomics analysis using gas chromatography-time-of-flight-mass spectrometry reveals that silencing of CENPF alters the global metabolic profiles of PC cells and inhibits cell proliferation, which suggests that CENPF may be a critical regulator of PC metabolism.

Purpose:   To compare the accuracy of clinical models, mpMRI, and mpMRI plus clinical models in predicting stage ≥pT3 of PCa.  Study type:   Prospective monocentric cohort study.  Population:   Seventy-three patients who underwent radical prostatectomy between 2016-2018.  Field strength/sequence:   3.0T using turbo spin echo (TSE) imaging, single-shot echoplanar diffusion-weighted imaging, and T1 -weighted high-resolution-isotropic-volume-examination (THRIVE) contrast-enhanced imaging.  Assessment:   We calculated the probability of extraprostatic extension (EPE) using the PT and MSKCC, as well as the CAPRA score. Three readers with 2-8 years of experience in mpMRI independently staged PCa on imaging.  Statistical tests:   Receiver operating characteristics analysis and logistic regression analysis to investigate the per-patient accuracy of mpMRI vs. clinical models vs. mpMRI plus clinical models in predicting stage ≥pT3. The alpha level was 0.05.  Results:   Median probability for EPE and MSKCCn was 27.3% and 47.0%, respectively. Median CAPRA score was 3. Stage ≥pT3 occurred in 32.9% of patients. Areas under the curve (AUCs) were 0.62 for PT, 0.62 for MSKCCn, 0.64 for CAPRA, and 0.73-0.75 for mpMRI (readers 1-3) (P > 0.05 for all comparisons). Compared with mpMRI, the combination of mpMRI with PT or MSKCCn provided lower AUCs (P > 0.05 for all the readers), while the combination with CAPRA provided significantly higher (P < 0.05) AUCs in the case of readers 1 and 3. On multivariable analysis, mpMRI by reader 1 was the only independent predictor of stage ≥pT3 (odds ratio 7.40). DATA CONCLUSION: mpMRI was more accurate than clinical models and mpMRI plus clinical models in predicting stage ≥pT3, except for the combination of mpMRI and CAPRA in two out of three readers.

However, the post‑transcriptional control regulation of BLM gene expression is not fully understood and limits the application of drugs targeting BLM for carcinoma therapy in the future. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) inhibit gene expression through interaction with the 3' untranslated region (3'‑UTR) of mRNA at the post‑transcriptional stage. Therefore, the current study screened for miRNAs that regulate BLM gene expression, with software predicting that miRNA (miR)‑27b‑3p, miR‑607, miR‑361‑3p, miR‑628‑5p and miR‑338‑3p. BLM gene expression levels in the PC3 prostate cancer cell line and RWPE‑2 normal prostate epithelium cell line were detected by reverse transcription‑quantitative PCR. Additionally, BLM mRNA levels were following miRNA overexpression for 24 and 48 h. For further miRNA filtration and validation, a dual‑luciferase reporter system and western blot analysis were performed, which demonstrated that miR‑27b‑3p and miR‑607 reduce BLM gene expression by directly targeting the BLM mRNA 3'‑UTR. A Box‑Behnken design experiment suggested that miR‑27b‑3p and miR‑607 have synergetic mutual effects on BLM gene expression. Finally, the suppressive effect of miR‑27b‑3p and miR‑607 on PC3 cell proliferation, colony formation, migration and invasion indicated the benefit of studying BLM as a drug target in cancer.

The aim of this study was to perform a planning feasibility analysis of a 3-level dose prescription with Simultaneous Integrated Boost (SIB) on the dominant intraprostatic lesion (DIL) and with S_OARs sparing.  Material and methods:   Twelve patients with clinically localized intermediate risk prostate cancer were included. The prostate, seminal vescicles, and DIL Clinical Target Volumes were delineated on rigid fused MRI-CT simulation images using mp-MRI as a separate guide. A 5 mm margin was added to define the PTVs. Penile bulb (PB), corpora cavernosa (CC), internal pudendal arteries (IPAs) and neurovascular bundles were contoured as S_OARs. The following doses were prescribed in 25 fractions: 56.25 Gy to PTVsv, 67.50 Gy to PTVp, and 75 Gy to PTVdil. Standard plans (SD-VMAT) were created to fulfil targets coverage and Quantec constraints for conventional OARs (SD_OARs: rectum, bladder, and femoral heads). For each patient, a new ""sexual-sparing"" plan (SS-VMAT) was created adding new objectives for S_OARs with priority to minimize mean doses to IPAs, CC, and PB.

A new European Association of Urology BCR risk stratification (low and high risk) has been proposed. To validate these risk groups, we retrospectively analyzed data for 1125 post-radical prostatectomy (RP) BCR patients (surgery between 1992 and 2006). Univariable Kaplan-Meier plots and multivariable Cox regression models with time-dependent covariates were used to test the independent predictor status of the risk grouping on metastatic progression (MP) and prostate cancer-specific mortality (PCSM). The 5-yr MP-free and PCSM-free survival rates were significantly higher among patients with low BCR risk compared to their high-risk counterparts. In multivariable analyses, the BCR risk grouping reached independent predictor status for MP (hazard ratio [HR] 3.46; p<0.001) and PCSM (HR 5.12; p<0.001). Salvage radiation therapy, especially when delivered at prostate-specific antigen <0.5ng/ml, was highly protective. Our findings corroborate the validity of this novel BCR risk grouping, which is easily applicable in daily practice and could be valuable in decision-making for salvage therapy and clinical trials.

Materials and methods:   PAE was attempted in 159 patients. Procedural details, pre/post-PAE symptom scores, and pre/post-PAE magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data were recorded. Statistical analysis was performed to determine clinical outcomes and factors predicting clinical success.  Results:   Technical success was achieved in 156 patients. In patients with LUTS, the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) improved from a mean of 22 at baseline to 9.5 at 6-months post-PAE, then to 10.7, 10, 11.3, and 11 at 1, 2, 3, and 4 years. The quality of life (QoL) score improved from 4.6 at baseline to 2, 2.2, 2.4, 3.1, and 2.5 at the same time points. The International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF-5) scores remained stable. There was no significant difference in IPSS between bilateral or unilateral embolisation to 2 years, or between BPH alone or BPH with biopsy-proven prostate cancer to 3 years post-PAE. Percentage improvement in IPSS at 1 year correlated with percentage reduction in prostate volume on first post-PAE MRI. Percentage improvement in IPSS at 3 years correlated with initial IPSS. PAE facilitated urinary catheter removal in 13/24 patients in retention. PAE controlled bleeding in 12/12 patients with RHOPA.

Analysis was conducted using the longitudinal survey data from the Bettering the Care and Evaluation of Health (BEACH) study. Consultations where prostate cancer was managed, but not classified as a new problem or associated with palliative care, were included. GPs provided physical activity recommendations at 2.0% (n = 58/2882) of prostate cancer survivorship management contacts. The physical activity management provided was physical activity counselling on 39 occasions and a physical activity referral on 19 occasions. All physical activity referrals were made to physiotherapy. After controlling for potential confounding factors, results showed that younger GPs used physical activity management at four-fold the rate of older GPs, and that GPs in major cities used physical activity management at twice the rate of rural GPs. No patient characteristics influenced physical activity management. Australian GPs rarely incorporate physical activity management as part of their management of prostate cancer.

More recently, the detailed pathway for approval from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) in the UK has been simplified. To explore how these changes have impacted on systemic anti-cancer therapy tumour site-specific prescribing and workload activities, we have reviewed the prescribing records for 2014-2018 in a UK cancer network.  Methods:   Information about the numbers of new systemic anti-cancer therapy drugs and NICE approvals were obtained from print editions of the British National Formulary (BNF) and the NICE website. Data on the numbers of new chemotherapy courses and individual treatment-related attendances were obtained from the cancer network Chemocare electronic prescribing system.  Results:   During the five-year study period, there were 49 new systemic anti-cancer therapy drugs for all tumour types, and a total of 65 NICE technology approvals for solid tumour indications. Overall numbers of treatment courses increased by 40.7% and total treatment-related visits by 80.6%. There was a wide variation across tumour types with the highest number of increased visits seen for melanoma (349.3%) and prostate cancer (242.3%), but in contrast, no appreciable increases were seen for lower gastrointestinal cancers or small cell lung cancer.  Conclusion:   The study confirms the major impact of the arrival of new drug technology and positive NICE appraisals on increasing systemic anti-cancer therapy prescribing and chemotherapy unit activity.

Methods:   Herein, we have performed a systematic fine-scale analysis of methylation at 14 CpGs located in the 5'-region of consensus LINE-1, in bladder, colon, prostate, and gastric tumor tissues using a global degenerate approach.  Results:   Our results reveal variable methylation levels between different CpGs, as well as some tissue-specific differences. Trends toward hypomethylation were observed in all tumors types to certain degrees, showing statistically significance in bladder and prostate tumors. Our data points toward the presence of unique LINE-1 DNA methylation patterns for each tumor type and tissue, indicating that not the same CpGs will be informative for testing in all tumor types.

Here, we provide evidence that FASN is a substrate of SPOP and that interaction of these proteins induces FASN ubiquitination and proteasome-dependent degradation. We showed that SPOP mutants commonly found in PCa cannot bind to FASN. Moreover, a decrease in SPOP levels upregulated FASN expression and triggered lipid accumulation in PCa cells. These results demonstrate that FASN is a crucial mediator of SPOP-induced inhibition of PCa cell growth.

Materials and methods:   Patients (n = 60) with confirmed PCa underwent preoperative 3T MRI. T2-weighted, multi-echo T2-weighted, diffusion weighted and dynamic contrast enhanced images (DCE) were obtained prior to undergoing prostatectomy. PCa and BPH (cystic, glandular or stromal) were identified in the transition zone and matched with MRI. Quantitative mpMRI metrics: T2, ADC and DCE-MRI parameters using an empirical mathematical model were measured.  Results:   ADC values were significantly lower (p < 0.001) in PCa compared to all BPH types and can differentiate between PCa and BPH with high accuracy (AUC = 0.87, p < 0.001). T2 values were significantly lower (p < 0.001) in PCa compared to cystic BPH only, while glandular (p = 0.27) and stromal BPH (p = 0.99) showed no significant difference from PCa. BPH mimics PCa in the transition zone on DCE-MRI evidenced by no significant difference between them. mpMRI values of glandular (ADC = 1.31 ± 0.22 µm2/ms, T2 = 115.7 ± 37.3 ms) and cystic BPH (ADC = 1.92 ± 0.43 µm2/ms, T2 = 242.8 ± 117.9 ms) are significantly different. There was no significant difference in ADC (p = 0.72) and T2 (p = 0.46) between glandular and stromal BPH.  Conclusions:   Multiparametric MRI and specifically quantitative ADC values can be used for differentiating PCa and BPH, improving PCa diagnosis in the transition zone. However, DCE-MRI metrics are not effective in distinguishing PCa and BPH. Glandular BPH are not hyperintense on ADC and T2 as previously thought and have similar quantitative mpMRI measurements to stromal BPH.

Underlying triggers for PMR are not well understood, but there have been reports of cases presenting prior to the diagnosis of prostate cancer, with one case of PMR presenting following prostatectomy. This report is of a case of PMR that presented following robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy for high-grade prostate cancer and includes a discussion of the possible associations. CASE REPORT A 61-year-old man underwent a robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy for high-grade prostate adenocarcinoma, Gleason grade 4+4=8. The surgical procedure and the patient's postoperative recovery were uneventful, and he was discharged from hospital on the day after surgery. Approximately two weeks later, he developed bilateral symptoms of pain in the groin, thigh, and shoulder girdle. His erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) (30 mm/h) and C-reactive protein (CRP) (16.2 mg/L) levels were raised. A diagnosis of PMR was made and treatment with tapered dosing of methylprednisolone resulted in a 90% improvement in symptoms after four weeks. CONCLUSIONS A case of PMR following robotic-assisted prostatectomy for high-grade prostate carcinoma is presented.

Methods: Mice bearing flank tumors (representative of lung, pancreatic, prostate, liver, skin, and lymphoid cancers) were injected intravenously with 9.25 MBq of 86Y-NM600 and imaged longitudinally over 4-5 d using small-animal PET/CT. Percentage injected activity per gram (%IA/g) for each volume of interest was measured at each time point for the organs of interest. Mice were euthanized after the final time point, and the tumor and organs of interest were counted with an automatic γ-counter. Absorbed doses delivered by 90Y-NM600 per injected activity (Gy/MBq) were estimated. Mice bearing B78 flank tumors were injected with a prescription of 90Y-NM600 that delivered 2.5 Gy of absorbed tumor dose and was compared with an equivalent absorbed dose delivered via external-beam radiotherapy using tumor volume as a measure of response. Histology and complete blood counts were analyzed in naïve C57BL/6 mice that were injected with 9.25 MBq of 90Y-NM600 at 5, 10, and 28 d after injection. Results: PET imaging showed consistent tumor accumulation and retention across all tumor models investigated, with little off-target retention of NM600 except in the liver, as is characteristic of hepatobiliary metabolism. The tumor uptake was highest in the pancreatic and lymphoid cancer models, reaching peak concentrations of 9.34 ± 2.66 %IA/g (n = 3) and 9.10 ± 0.13 %IA/g (n = 3), respectively, at approximately 40-48 h after injection. These corresponded to tumor dose estimates of 2.72 ± 0.33 Gy/MBq and 2.67 ± 0.32 Gy/MBq, respectively. In the toxicity study, there were no visible signs of acute toxicity by histology, and perturbation of hematologic parameters was transient when observed, returning to pretherapy levels after 28 d. Conclusion: NM600 is a theranostic agent with a unique ability to selectively target a variety of cancer types, presenting a unique opportunity for PET image-guided targeted radionuclide therapy and combination with immunotherapies.""","""['Joseph J Grudzinski', 'Reinier Hernandez', 'Ian Marsh', 'Ravi B Patel', 'Eduardo Aluicio-Sarduy', 'Jon Engle', 'Zachary Morris', 'Bryan Bednarz', 'Jamey Weichert']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""J Nucl Med""","""['177Lu-NM600 Targeted Radionuclide Therapy Extends Survival in Syngeneic Murine Models of Triple-Negative Breast Cancer.', ""90Y-NM600 targeted radionuclide therapy induces immunologic memory in syngeneic models of T-cell Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma."", 'Pharmacokinetics and Biodistribution of (86)Y-Trastuzumab for (90)Y dosimetry in an ovarian carcinoma model: correlative MicroPET and MRI.', 'Preclinical evaluation of 86Y-labeled inhibitors of prostate-specific membrane antigen for dosimetry estimates.', 'Automated processing of solid target 86Y using enriched SrO powder.', 'Effect of Polar Head Group Modifications on the Tumor Retention of Phospholipid Ether Analogs: Role of the Quaternary Nitrogen.', 'Radiation to all macroscopic sites of tumor permits greater systemic antitumor response to in situ vaccination.', 'Next-Generation Cancer Magnetic Resonance Imaging With Tumor-Targeted Alkylphosphocholine Metal Analogs.', 'Antitumor efficacy of 90Y-NM600 targeted radionuclide therapy and PD-1 blockade is limited by regulatory T cells in murine prostate tumors.', 'Safety and feasibility of an in situ vaccination and immunomodulatory targeted radionuclide combination immuno-radiotherapy approach in a comparative (companion dog) setting.']"""

Methods: Twenty-one patients (prostate-specific antigen level, 7.4 ± 6.8 ng/mL) with biochemical recurrence after nonprostatectomy local therapy (radiotherapy and cryotherapy) underwent dual-time-point 18F-fluciclovine (364.1 ± 37.7 MBq) PET/CT from pelvis to diaphragm. Prostatic uptake over background was delineated and coregistered to a prostate-biopsy-planning ultrasound. Transrectal biopsies of 18F-fluciclovine-defined targets were completed using a 3-dimensional visualization and navigation platform. Histologic analyses of lesions were completed. Lesion characteristics including SUVmax, target-to-background ratio (TBR), uptake pattern, and subjective reader's suspicion level were compared between true-positive (malignant) and false-positive (benign) lesions. Univariate analysis was used to determine the association between PET and histologic findings. Receiver-operating-characteristic curves were plotted to determine discriminatory cutoffs for TBR. Statistical significance was set at a P value of less than 0.05. Results: Fifty lesions were identified in 21 patients on PET. Seventeen of 50 (34.0%) targeted lesions in 10 of 21 patients were positive for malignancy. True-positive lesions had a significantly higher SUVmax (6.62 ± 1.70 vs. 4.92 ± 1.27), marrow TBR (2.57 ± 0.81 vs. 1.69 ± 0.51), and blood-pool TBR (4.10 ± 1.17 vs. 2.99 ± 1.01) than false-positive lesions at the early time point (P < 0.01) and remained significant at the delayed time point, except for blood-pool TBR. Focal uptake (odds ratio, 12.07; 95% confidence interval, 2.98-48.80; P < 0.01) and subjective highest suspicion level (odds ratio, 10.91; 95% confidence interval, 1.19-99.69; P = 0.03) correlated with true positivity. Using the receiver-operating-characteristic curve, optimal cutoffs for marrow TBR were 1.9 (area under the curve, 0.82) and 1.8 (area under the curve, 0.85) at early and delayed imaging, respectively. With these cutoffs, 15 of 17 malignant lesions were identified at both time points; however, fewer false-positive lesions were detected at the delayed time point (5/33) than at the early time point (11/33). Conclusion: True positivity of 18F-fluciclovine-targeted prostate biopsy in non-prostatectomy-treated patients correlates with focal uptake, TBR (blood pool and marrow), and subjective highest suspicion level. A marrow TBR of 1.9 at the early time point and 1.8 at the delayed time point had optimal discriminating capabilities.

FAP is overexpressed by cancer-associated fibroblasts of several tumor entities. Here, we quantify the tumor uptake on 68Ga-FAPI PET/CT of various primary and metastatic tumors to identify the most promising indications for future application. Methods:68Ga-FAPI PET/CT scans were requested by various referring physicians according to individual clinical indications that were considered insufficiently covered by 18F-FDG PET/CT or other imaging modalities. All PET/CT was performed 1 h after injection of 122-312 MBq of 68Ga-FAPI-04. We retrospectively identified 80 patients with histopathologically proven primary tumors or metastases or radiologically unequivocal metastatic lesions of histologically proven primary tumors. Tumor uptake was quantified by SUVmax and SUVmean (60% isocontour). Results: Eighty patients with 28 different tumor entities (54 primary tumors and 229 metastases) were evaluated. The highest average SUVmax (>12) was found in sarcoma, esophageal, breast, cholangiocarcinoma, and lung cancer. The lowest 68Ga-FAPI uptake (average SUVmax < 6) was observed in pheochromocytoma, renal cell, differentiated thyroid, adenoid cystic, and gastric cancer. The average SUVmax of hepatocellular, colorectal, head-neck, ovarian, pancreatic, and prostate cancer was intermediate (SUV 6-12). SUV varied across and within all tumor entities. Because of low background in muscle and blood pool (SUVmax < 2), the tumor-to-background contrast ratios were more than 3-fold in the intermediate and more than 6-fold in the high-intensity uptake group. Conclusion: Several highly prevalent cancers presented with remarkably high uptake and image contrast on 68Ga-FAPI PET/CT. The high and rather selective tumor uptake may open up new applications for noninvasive tumor characterization, staging examinations, or radioligand therapy.""","""['Clemens Kratochwil', 'Paul Flechsig', 'Thomas Lindner', 'Labidi Abderrahim', 'Annette Altmann', 'Walter Mier', 'Sebastian Adeberg', 'Hendrik Rathke', 'Manuel Röhrich', 'Hauke Winter', 'Peter K Plinkert', 'Frederik Marme', 'Matthias Lang', 'Hans-Ulrich Kauczor', 'Dirk Jäger', 'Jürgen Debus', 'Uwe Haberkorn', 'Frederik L Giesel']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""J Nucl Med""","""['68Ga FAPI PET/CT: Tracer Uptake in 28 Different Kinds of Cancer.', '68Ga-FAPI PET/CT: Biodistribution and Preliminary Dosimetry Estimate of 2 DOTA-Containing FAP-Targeting Agents in Patients with Various Cancers.', '68Ga-FAPI-PET/CT in patients with various gynecological malignancies.', 'Fibroblast-Activation Protein PET and Histopathology in a Single-Center Database of 324 Patients and 21 Tumor Entities.', 'Head-to-head intra-individual comparison of biodistribution and tumor uptake of 68Ga-FAPI and 18F-FDG PET/CT in cancer patients.', 'Fibroblast Activation Protein Inhibitor PET/CT: A Promising Molecular Imaging Tool.', 'Feasibility of acquisitions using total-body PET/CT with a half-dose 68GaGa-FAPI-04 activity in oncology patients.', 'The role of cancer-associated fibroblasts in breast cancer metastasis.', '68GaGa-DOTA-FAPI-04 PET/CT depicts metastases from medullary thyroid cancer that 68GaGa-DOTATOC\xa0PET/CT\xa0missed.', 'Fibroblast Activation Protein-Targeted Photodynamic Therapy of Cancer-Associated Fibroblasts in Murine Models for Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma.', 'Advances in PET/CT Imaging for Breast Cancer.']"""

Tumor cell heterogeneity and sensitivity to microenvironment signals, such as hypoxia or extracellular calcium concentration, are difficult to reproduce. Here, we developed and characterized an ex vivo tissue culture model preserving these properties. Prostate tissue slices from 26 patients were maintained ex vivo under optimized culture conditions. The expression of markers associated with proliferation, androgen-receptor signaling, and hypoxia was assessed by immunostaining. A macroscope was used to achieve real-time calcium fluorescence optical imaging. Tissue morphology was maintained successfully without necrosis for 5 days. Compared with native tumors and tissue cultured with androgens, androgen deprivation in the medium led to decreased expression of both androgen receptor and its target gene products, prostate specific antigen (PSA) and ETS-related gene (ERG). Ex vivo cultured slices also were sensitive to hypoxia because carbonic anhydrase IX and zinc finger E-box binding homeobox 1 (Zeb1) protein levels increased in 1% oxygen. Exposure of slices to supraphysiological extracellular Ca2+ concentration induced a robust and rapid Ca2+ entry, with a greater response in tumor compared with nontumor tissue. This ex vivo model reproduces the morphologic and functional characteristics of human prostate cancer, including sensitivity to androgen deprivation and induced response to hypoxia and extracellular Ca2+. It therefore could become an attractive tool for drug response prediction studies.""","""['Sandy Figiel', 'Côme Pasqualin', 'Fanny Bery', 'Veronique Maupoil', 'Christophe Vandier', 'Marie Potier-Cartereau', 'Isabelle Domingo', 'Roseline Guibon', 'Franck Bruyere', 'Karine Maheo', 'Gaelle Fromont']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Am J Pathol""","""['Carbonic anhydrase IX is a marker of hypoxia and correlates with higher Gleason scores and ISUP grading in prostate cancer.', 'Hypoxia Promotes Prostate Cancer Aggressiveness by Upregulating EMT-Activator Zeb1 and SK3 Channel Expression.', 'Prostate cancer cells and exosomes in acidic condition show increased carbonic anhydrase IX expression and activity.', 'Hypoxia-induced carbonic anhydrase IX as a target for cancer therapy: from biology to clinical use.', 'Prognostic value of biochemical response to neoadjuvant androgen deprivation before external beam radiotherapy for prostate cancer: A systematic review of the literature.', 'Culture of vibrating microtome tissue slices as a 3D model in biomedical research.', 'Calcium signalling pathways in prostate cancer initiation and progression.', 'Experimental in vitro, ex\xa0vivo and in vivo models in prostate cancer research.', 'Recent advances in organotypic tissue slice cultures for anticancer drug development.', 'Harnessing the Utility of Ex Vivo Patient Prostate Tissue Slice Cultures.']"""

Materials and methods:   Fifty prostate cancer patients who had undergone a single TURP, had a good baseline urinary function, and had been subsequently treated with SBRT were chosen from a prospectively maintained database. These were propensity score matched to a similar non-TURP cohort treated during the same period. Matching was done for diabetes mellitus and volume of radiation therapy. Acute GU and late GU toxicity were scored using the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) criteria. Stricture and incontinence were scored using Common Terminology for Common Adverse Events version 4.0.  Results:   Median follow-up for the entire cohort was 26 months (non-TURP vs TURP, 30 months vs 22 months, P = .34). The median duration between TURP and start of SBRT was 10 months. There was no significant difference between non-TURP versus TURP cohort in terms of RTOG acute GU toxicities grade ≥2 (8% vs 6%, P = .45), RTOG late GU toxicities grade ≥2 (8% vs 12%, P = .10), stricture rates (4% vs 6%, P = .64), and incontinence rates (0% vs 4%, P = .15). The median duration of time to late toxicity was 16 months vs 10 months (P = .12) in non-TURP and TURP cohort, respectively.  Conclusions:   Although modestly increased as compared with non-TURP patients, GU toxicities remains low with SBRT in post-TURP patients.

The use of nano-materials for cancer phototherapy (solid tumor ablation) can cause cell necrosis and apoptosis. However, photothermal effects using the same material can differ among tumor cell types, and the molecular mechanisms underlying these differences are not clear. We used polydopamine (PDA)-coated branched Au-Ag nanoparticles (Au-Ag@PDA NPs) for the photothermal treatment of two prostate cancer cell lines. The therapeutic effect was evaluated by CCK8, flow cytometry, and expression analyses of related genes by western blotting. Photothermal therapy resulted in oxidative stress in prostate cancer cells and activated the mitochondrial-related apoptosis pathway, increasing the Bax expression. In addition, we observed a greater photothermal treatment effect on the androgen-dependent cells LNCaP than the androgen-independent cells DU145. Pretreatment with an inhibitor of the NF-κB signaling pathway (BAY 11-7082) enhanced the expression of BAX in the DU145 cells and increased the sensitivity of the cells to the heat treatment of Au-Ag@PDA NPs both in vitro and in vivo.

Our previous studies showed that immunohistochemical testing for Ki-67 improved prediction of prostate cancer death in a previous cohort of conservatively treated clinically localized prostate cancer. However there is a need for validation of usage with whole biopsy sections rather than tissue micro-arrays for use in routine diagnostics. Prostate cancer biopsy cases were identified in the UK, between 1990 and 2003, treated conservatively. Tumor extent and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) serum measurements were available. Biopsy cases were centrally reviewed by three uropathologists and Gleason conformed to contemporary ISUP 2014 criteria. Follow-up was through cancer registries up until 2012. Deaths were divided into those from prostate cancer and those from other causes. The percentage of Ki-67 in tumor cells was evaluated by immunohistochemistry on whole biopsy sections and was available for 756 patients. This percentage was used in analysis of cancer specific survival using a Cox proportional hazards model. In univariate analysis, the interquartile hazard ratio (HR) (95% confidence intervals) for continuous Ki-67 was 1.68 (1.49, 1.89), χ12 = 47.975, P < 0.001. In grade groups 1 and 2, continuous Ki-67 was a statistically significant predictor of time to death from prostate cancer, HR (95% CI) = 1.97 (1.34, 2.88), χ12 = 9.017, p = 0.003. In multivariate analysis, continuous Ki-67 added significant predictive information to that provided by grade groups, extent of disease and serum PSA, HR (95% CI) = 1.34 (1.16, 1.54), Δχ12 = 13.703, P < 0.001. We now advocate the introduction of Ki-67 as a viable and practicable prognostic biomarker in clinical practice.

However, its utility in black populations known to have benign ethnic neutropenia is unknown. We evaluated the prognostic value of NLR in Nigerian men with CRPC in terms of OS.  Materials and methods:   We retrospectively analysed 58 patients with castration resistant prostate cancer who received androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) and docetaxel chemotherapy at our institution. Baseline NLR was calculated from available complete blood counts. NLR cut-off point value was determined based on receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curves for mortality. A multivariate analysis was performed to investigate the association between NLR and OS.  Results:   Based on the ROC curves, the NLR (AUC 0.85, 95% CI 0.74-0.97, P = 0.0001) cut-off point was determined to be 1.8. This cut-off point has a sensitivity of 92% and specificity of 70%. Median OS was 20 months (95% CI 14-27 months); the median OS in patients with NLR <1.8 and those with NLR of ≥1.8 was 40 months and 12 months respectively.

For patients with breast, ovarian, or prostate cancers, overall survival is associated with increased sensitivity to platinum chemotherapy due to loss-of-function mutations in DNA repair genes. The goal of this project was to evaluate, in patients with malignant mesothelioma, the relationship between inherited loss-of-function mutations in DNA repair and other tumor suppressor genes and overall survival following platinum chemotherapy. Patients with histologically confirmed malignant mesothelioma were evaluated for inherited mutations in tumor suppressor genes. Survival was evaluated with respect to genotype and site of mesothelioma. Among 385 patients treated with platinum chemotherapy, median overall survival was significantly longer for patients with loss-of-function mutations in any of the targeted genes compared with patients with no such mutation (P = 0.0006). The effect of genotype was highly significant for patients with pleural mesothelioma (median survival 7.9 y versus 2.4 y, P = 0.0012), but not for patients with peritoneal mesothelioma (median survival 8.2 y versus 5.4 y, P = 0.47). Effect of patient genotype on overall survival, measured at 3 y, remained independently significant after adjusting for gender and age at diagnosis, two other known prognostic factors. Patients with pleural mesothelioma with inherited mutations in DNA repair and other tumor suppressor genes appear to particularly benefit from platinum chemotherapy compared with patients without inherited mutations.

L-securinine (2.5, 5, and 10 μM) treatment for 24, 48 and 72 h displayed strong growth inhibitory effect on DU145 cells in a concentration and time-dependent fashion but has less toxicity toward normal androgen-dependent LNCaP cells. Hoechst 332582 staining of DU145 cells and Annexin V-FITC/ PI dual-labeling followed by flow cytometry assay identified that this growth inhibition by L-securinine would be due to the induction of apoptosis. Moreover Transwell assay revealed that L-securinine significantly inhibited the cell migration/invasion ability of DU145 cells. Furthermore, results of western blotting showed that the involvement of mitochondrial apoptotic pathway in the L-securinine-induced apoptosis of DU145 cell, as evidenced by an increase in the protein expression of Bax, cleaved caspase-9, cleaved caspase-3, cytosolic cytochrome c, and cleaved PARP, together with a unchanged cleaved caspase-8 and decreased Bcl-2 protein expression. Also, L-securinine-induced antimetastatic activity in DU145 cells was associated with decreased protein expression of MMP-2 and MMP-9 and concurrent reduction of VEGF. In addition, further studies revealed that L-securinine may inhibit the protein expression of AGTR1, p-MEK1/2, p-ERK1/2, p-STAT3, PAX2, and p-PAX2, while the expression of ERK1/2, MEK1/2, and STAT3 protein retains intact.

There is sparse data on the value of complete versus partial sampling and numbers of inclusions in studies are small and retrospective. We present the results of a prospective non-inferiority study to examine if partial sampling is inferior to complete sampling in terms of pathology outcomes and clinical relevance.  Methods:   564 robot-assisted prostatectomy (RARP) specimens with prospective registration and analysis were collected over a 2-year period. All patients underwent RARP between January 2014 and February 2016 in our hospital after a diagnosis of clinically localised prostate cancer. For each patient, tumour stage and surgical margin status was recorded after partial and after complete sampling. Upstaging from pT2 to pT3a and upgrading from a negative-to-positive surgical margin was analysed.  Results:   In 12 of 564 patients (2.1%), complete sampling yielded new information. In eight patients (1.4%), the surgical margin converted to positive after complete sampling. Upstaging from initial pT2 tumour in partial sampling to pT3a tumour after complete sampling was documented in five patients (0.9%). In the follow-up period (mean 35 months), a biochemical recurrence occurred in one patient.  Conclusions:   Complete sampling provides new information in only 2.1% of cases, compared with partial sampling. We conclude that the additional information gained by complete sampling in terms of stage and surgical margin detection is statistically insignificant compared with partial sampling.

Due to the development of castration-resistance, traditional first-line androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) became powerlessness. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a well characterized therapeutic target to treat colorectal carcinoma and non-small cell lung cancer. Increasing studies have unraveled the significance of EGFR and its downstream signaling in the progression of castration-resistant PCa.  Method:   MTS, colony formation and Edu staining assays were used to analyze the cell proliferation of PCa cells. Flow cytometry was used to analyze PCa cell cycle distribution and cell apoptosis. Western blot was used to measure the expression of key proteins associated with cell cycle progression, apoptosis and EGFR signaling pathways. Transfection of exogenous small interfering RNA (siRNA) or plasmid was used to intervene specific gene expression. Nude mouse model was employed to test the in vivo effect of Spautin-1.  Results:   The current study reveals that Spautin-1, a known inhibitor of ubiquitin-specific peptidase 10 (USP10) and USP13, inhibits EGFR phosphorylation and the activation of its downstream signaling. Inhibition of EGFR signaling induced by Spautin-1 leads to cell cycle arrest and apoptosis of PCa in a USP10/USP13 independent manner. The application of Spautin-1 reduces the expression of glucose transporter 1 (Glut1) and dramatically induces cell death under glucose deprivation condition. In vivo experiments show a potent anti-tumor effect of Spautin-1 alone and in combination with Enzalutamide.  Conclusion:   This study demonstrates the therapeutic potential of EGFR signaling inhibition by the use of Spautin-1 for PCa treatment.""","""['Yuning Liao', 'Zhiqiang Guo', 'Xiaohong Xia', 'Yuan Liu', 'Chuyi Huang', 'Lili Jiang', 'Xuejun Wang', 'Jinbao Liu', 'Hongbiao Huang']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""J Exp Clin Cancer Res""","""['Potent USP10/13 antagonist spautin-1 suppresses melanoma growth via ROS-mediated DNA damage and exhibits synergy with cisplatin.', 'Traditional Chinese Medicine CFF-1 induced cell growth inhibition, autophagy, and apoptosis via inhibiting EGFR-related pathways in prostate cancer.', 'Structure-Activity Relationship (SAR) Study of Spautin-1 to Entail the Discovery of Novel NEK4 Inhibitors.', 'Prostate cancer: the need for biomarkers and new therapeutic targets.', 'Current mouse and cell models in prostate cancer research.', 'Nuclear transport maintenance of USP22-AR by Importin-7 promotes breast cancer progression.', 'Synthesis of Novel 2-(Cyclopentylamino)thiazol-4(5H)-one Derivatives with Potential Anticancer, Antioxidant, and 11β-HSD Inhibitory Activities.', 'Antiandrogen-Equipped Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors Selectively Inhibit Androgen Receptor (AR) and AR-Splice Variant (AR-SV) in Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer (CRPC).', 'Ubiquitin specific peptidases and prostate cancer.', 'Protein degradation: expanding the toolbox to restrain cancer drug resistance.']"""

Therapeutic advancement in prostate cancer has not been able to reduce the mortality burden of prostate cancer, which warrants further research. FRG1 which affects angiogenesis and cell migration in Xenopus, can be a potential player in tumorigenesis. In this study, we investigated the role of FRG1 in prostate cancer progression.  Methods:   Immunohistochemistry was performed to determine FRG1 expression in patient samples. FRG1 expression perturbation was done to investigate the effect of FRG1 on cell proliferation, migration and invasion, in DU145, PC3 and LNCaP cells. To understand the mechanism, we checked expression of various cytokines and MMPs by q-RT PCR, signaling molecules by western blot, in FRG1 perturbation sets. Results were validated by use of pharmacological inhibitor and activator and, western blot.  Results:   In prostate cancer tissue, FRG1 levels were significantly reduced, compared to the uninvolved counterpart. FRG1 expression showed variable effect on PC3 and DU145 cell proliferation. FRG1 levels consistently affected cell migration and invasion, in both DU145 and PC3 cells. Ectopic expression of FRG1 led to significant reduction in cell migration and invasion in both DU145 and PC3 cells, reverse trends were observed with FRG1 knockdown. In androgen receptor positive cell line LNCaP, FRG1 doesn't affect any of the cell properties. FRG1 knockdown led to significantly enhanced expression of GM-CSF, MMP1, PDGFA and CXCL1, in PC3 cells and, in DU145, it led to higher expression of GM-CSF, MMP1 and PLGF. Interestingly, FRG1 knockdown in both the cell lines led to activation of p38 MAPK. Pharmacological activation of p38 MAPK led to increase in the expression of GM-CSF and PLGF in DU145 whereas in PC3 it led to enhanced expression of GM-CSF, MMP1 and CXCL1. On the other hand, inhibition of p38 MAPK led to reduction in the expression of above mentioned cytokines.  Conclusion:   FRG1 expression is reduced in prostate adenocarcinoma tissue. FRG1 expression affects migration and invasion in AR negative prostate cancer cells through known MMPs and cytokines, which may be mediated primarily via p38 MAPK activation.""","""['Ankit Tiwari', 'Bratati Mukherjee', 'Md Khurshidul Hassan', 'Niharika Pattanaik', 'Archita Mohanty Jaiswal', 'Manjusha Dixit']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""BMC Cancer""","""['Increased FSHD region gene1 expression reduces in vitro cell migration, invasion, and angiogenesis, ex vivo supported by reduced expression in tumors.', 'TGF-β Effects on Prostate Cancer Cell Migration and Invasion Require FosB.', 'Inhibition of cortactin and SIRT1 expression attenuates migration and invasion of prostate cancer DU145 cells.', 'Overexpression of HepaCAM inhibits cell viability and motility through suppressing nucleus translocation of androgen receptor and ERK signaling in prostate cancer.', 'Androgen receptor and prostate cancer invasion.', 'Neoadjuvant therapy with camrelizumab plus gemcitabine and cisplatin for patients with muscle-invasive bladder cancer: A multi-center, single-arm, phase 2 study.', 'Reduced FRG1 expression promotes angiogenesis via activation of the FGF2-mediated ERK/AKT pathway.', 'MAPK8IP2 is a potential prognostic biomarker and promote tumor progression in prostate cancer.', 'Reduced expression of FRG1 facilitates breast cancer progression via GM-CSF/MEK-ERK axis by abating FRG1 mediated transcriptional repression of GM-CSF.', 'DNA topoisomerase II alpha promotes the metastatic characteristics of glioma cells by transcriptionally activating β-catenin.']"""

The synthesized compounds G1⁻G13 were evaluated in vitro for their cytotoxicity against PC-3 cells using the MTT assay, and molecular docking studies were performed. Results showed that most tested compounds exhibited improved antitumor efficacy compared with INH. Moreover, conjugates G10 and G11 showed potent anticancer activity with IC50 values (0.85 and 0.4 μM respectively) comparable to that of doxorubicin (DOX). This may be attributable to the preferential accumulation of these conjugates in tumor cells. G10, G11, and G12 also demonstrated moderate MAOA inhibitory activities. This result and the results of molecular docking studies were consistent with their cytotoxicity activities. Taken together, these data suggest that a combination of the MAOA inhibitor INH with tumor-targeting heptamethine cyanine dyes may prove to be a highly promising tool for the treatment of advanced prostate cancer.""","""['Xiao-Guang Yang', 'Yan-Hua Mou', 'Yong-Jun Wang', 'Jian Wang', 'Yan-Yu Li', 'Rui-Heng Kong', 'Meng Ding', 'Dun Wang', 'Chun Guo']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Molecules""","""['Mitochondria-targeted prostate cancer therapy using a near-infrared fluorescence dye-monoamine oxidase A inhibitor conjugate.', 'Application of novel pH sensitive isoniazid-heptamethine carbocyanine dye conjugates against prostate cancer cells.', 'Repurposing antitubercular agent isoniazid for treatment of prostate cancer.', 'Monoamine oxidase A (MAOA): A promising target for prostate cancer therapy.', 'Monoamine oxidase A: An emerging therapeutic target in prostate cancer.', 'Design, Synthesis, and Biological Evaluation of Novel MAO-A Inhibitors Targeting Lung Cancer.', 'Monoamine Oxidase (MAO) as a Potential Target for Anticancer Drug Design and Development.', 'Monoamine Oxidase A is a Major Mediator of Mitochondrial Homeostasis and Glycolysis in Gastric Cancer Progression.', 'Potential monoamine oxidase A inhibitor suppressing paclitaxel-resistant non-small cell lung cancer metastasis and growth.', 'Bioinspired Heterocyclic Partnership in a Cyanine-Type Acidichromic Chromophore.']"""

Specialised palliative home care (German acronym 'SAPV') enables patients with complex symptoms and intensive care needs to receive home care until death. In the German Federal State of Hesse, the first SAPV teams were set up in 2009. Against this background, the aim of this study was (i) to investigate the utilization of SAPV and specialised inpatient palliative care in the last year of life of cancer patients, (ii) to detect the medical professions prescribing SAPV and (iii) to analyse the place of death and the hospitalization rate in the last 91 days of life.  Methods:   A retrospective secondary data analysis was conducted. Routine data from the statutory health insurance company AOK Hesse in Germany for 2009-2014 were analysed using descriptive statistical methods. The study population comprised breast, prostate, and colorectal cancer patients who died in the year of observation (2010-2014) and who were fully insured 360 days before death.  Results:   Depending on the year of observation, 492-545 breast, 546-625 prostate, and 709-752 colorectal cancer patients were included in the study. The analysis showed an increase of cancer patients receiving palliative care from 2010 to 2014. A higher proportion of breast, prostate, and colorectal cancer patients received SAPV as compared to services from palliative care units or inpatient hospices. All in all, over 90% of the SAPV prescriptions were issued by family doctors. The hospitalization rate of cancer patients in the last 91 days of life as well as the share of those dying in hospital decreased between 2010 and 2014.  Conclusion:   The results must be assessed in the context of the implementation of SAPV in the state of Hesse. The increase of SAPV services and the reduction of hospitalizations at the end of life indicate a successful introduction of SAPV in the state of Hesse.""","""['Katja Blaschke', 'Kerstin Hermes-Moll', 'Veronika Lappe', 'Peter Ihle', 'Walter Baumann', 'Ingrid Schubert']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Gesundheitswesen""","""['End-of-life care in a rural small-town region in Lower Saxony: a retrospective cross-sectional analysis based on routinely collected general practice data.', 'Study protocol for a multi-methods study: SAVOIR - evaluation of specialized outpatient palliative care (SAPV) in Germany: outcomes, interactions, regional differences.', 'Specialised palliative home care (SAPV) in an urban setting--a first year experience.', 'Patient-reported outcomes and quality of care in specialized palliative home care: a nationwide, prospective longitudinal cohort trial.', 'Palliative home care for patients with advanced haematological malignancies-a multicenter survey.', 'Quality of care in the last year of life: adaptation and validation of the German ""Views of Informal Carers\' Evaluation of Services - Last Year of Life - Cologne"".']"""

In this study, we demonstrated that CXCR6-CXCL16 axis promotes DTX resistance and acts as a counter-defense mechanism. After CXCR6 activation, cell death in response to DTX was inhibited, and blocking of CXCR6 potentiated DTX cytotoxicity. Moreover, in response to DTX, PCa cells expressed higher CXCR6, CXCL16, and ADAM-10. Furthermore, ADAM-10-mediated release of CXCL16 hyper-activated CXCR6 signaling in response to DTX. Activation of CXCR6 resulted in increased GSK-3β, NF-κB, ERK1/2 phosphorylation, and survivin expression, which reduce DTX response. Finally, treatment of PCa cells with anti-CXCR6 monoclonal antibody synergistically or additively induced cell death with ∼1.5-4.5 fold reduction in the effective concentration of DTX.

Methods:   Data from patients with prostate cancer who underwent SRT for biochemical recurrence between 2005 and 2012 in two academic institutions were retrospectively reviewed. Patients treated with WPRT in one hospital were compared with patients treated with PBRT in the other. Propensity scoring was performed to balance the characteristics of the different treatment groups, and bRFS was compared.  Results:   Data from a total of 191 patients were included in the analysis (WPRT, n = 108; PBRT, n = 83). The median follow-up period was 66 months. Prior to matching, patients who received WPRT had higher pathologic Gleason scores as well as a higher incidence of pre-SRT PSA levels >0.5 ng/mL and lower rates of concurrent androgen-deprivation therapy. Propensity score matching balanced these characteristics and generated a cohort comprising 56 patients from each group. In the matched cohort, the 5 year bRFS of the WPRT group was significantly higher than that of the PBRT group (65.9 vs. 42.2%, p = 0.017). Multivariate analysis revealed that WPRT was an independent prognostic factor for bRFS (hazard ratio: 0.45, 95% confidence interval: 0.26-0.75, p = 0.002). This benefit of WPRT on bRFS was maintained in subgroup analyses, especially in patients with preoperative PSA level ≤20 ng/mL or pre-SRT PSA level ≥0.4 ng/mL.  Conclusions:   These data suggest that, following radical prostatectomy, elective WPRT during SRT may improve bRFS compared with PBRT in selected patients. Patients with preoperative PSA level ≤20 ng/mL or pre-SRT PSA level ≥0.4 ng/mL represent a potential subgroup who benefit most from receiving WPRT.

To know their relationship with established classical markers (Preoperative serum prostate specific antigen, pathological tumor stage, clinical tumor stage, Gleason score, perineural invasion, node involvement, positive surgical margins, biochemical progression, and survival) and their importance in the prognosis of biochemical progression, Spearman test, survival analysis, Log-rang test, Kaplan-Meier curves, univariate and multivariate Cox proportional Hazard regression analyses were performed. Spearman analysis showed that there was at least one correlation between TGF-β, TGFBRI, PI3K, pAKT-Thr, p-mTOR, NF-kBp50, and classical markers. Cox multivariate analysis between the prognostic variables (pathological tumor stage, Gleason score, and node involvement) and inmunohistochemical parameters confirmed TGFBR1 and PI3K as a prognostic and independent marker of biochemical progression in prostate cancer.

Therefore, targeting metabolism may provide an effective strategy for identifying promising drug targets for cancer treatment. In prostate cancer, cells undergo metabolic transformation from zinc-accumulating, citrate-producing cells to citrate-oxidizing malignant cells with lower zinc levels and higher mitochondrial aconitase (ACO2) activity. ACO2 is a Krebs cycle enzyme that converts citrate to isocitrate and is sensitive to reactive oxygen species (ROS)-mediated damage. In this study, we found that the expression of ACO2 is positively correlated with the malignancy of prostate cancer. Both zinc and p53 can lead to an increase in ROS. ACO2 can be a target for remodeling metabolism by sensing changes in the ROS levels of prostate cancer.

Targeted drug-loaded nano-carriers with antibodies for receptors that are overexpressed on tumor cells are promising strategies for decreasing toxicity to normal tissues and enhancing the efficacy of chemotherapies in cancer treatment.

The targeted liposomes had a mean particle size of 134 nm, and the drug encapsulation efficiency of both Sim and DOX were greater than 80%. We discovered that the drug combination led to the strong inhibition of PCa both in vitro and in vivo, with inhibitory rates of tumor volumes corresponding to 80.36% and 68.77% of Herceptin-coated liposomes and non-targeted liposomes, respectively.

Dorsolateral prostate from 20 week transgenic adenocarcinoma of the mouse prostate (TRAMP) mice, which spontaneously develops prostate cancer and recapitulates human disease and age-matched non-transgenic littermates were utilized for microarray analysis. Mouse genome network and pathway analyses were mapped to the human genome using the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) database for annotation, visualization, and integrated discovery. In total, 136 differentially expressed genes, including 32 downregulated genes and 104 upregulated genes were identified in the dorsolateral prostate of TRAMP, compared to non-transgenic mice. A subset of differentially expressed genes were validated by qRT-PCR. Alignment with human genome database identified 18 different classes of proteins, among these, 36% were connected to the nucleic acid binding, including ribosomal proteins, which play important role in protein synthesis-the most enriched pathway in the development of prostate cancer. Furthermore, the results suggest deregulation of signaling molecules (9%) and enzyme modulators (8%) affect various pathways. An imbalance in other protein classes, including transporter proteins (7%), hydrolases (6%), oxidoreductases, and cytoskeleton proteins (5%), contribute to cancer progression. Our study evaluated the underlying pathways and its connection to human prostate cancer, which may further help assess the risk of disease development and progression and identify potential targets for therapeutic intervention.""","""['Shiv Verma', 'Sanjeev Shukla', 'Mitali Pandey', 'Gregory T MacLennan', 'Sanjay Gupta']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Front Genet""","""['Gene expression profile of mouse prostate tumors reveals dysregulations in major biological processes and identifies potential murine targets for preclinical development of human prostate cancer therapy.', 'Constitutive activation of P I3 K-Akt and NF-kappaB during prostate cancer progression in autochthonous transgenic mouse model.', 'miR-93-5p may be an important oncogene in prostate cancer by bioinformatics analysis.', 'Murine six-transmembrane epithelial antigen of the prostate, prostate stem cell antigen, and prostate-specific membrane antigen: prostate-specific cell-surface antigens highly expressed in prostate cancer of transgenic adenocarcinoma mouse prostate mice.', 'Transgenic Adenocarcinoma of the Mouse Prostate (TRAMP) model: A good alternative to study PCa progression and chemoprevention approaches.', 'Mitochondrial Alterations in Prostate Cancer: Roles in Pathobiology and Racial Disparities.', 'Prostate cancer resistance leads to a global deregulation of translation factors and unconventional translation.', 'The Multifaceted Role of Aldehyde Dehydrogenases in Prostate Cancer Stem Cells.', 'Androgen Deprivation Induces Transcriptional Reprogramming in Prostate Cancer Cells to Develop Stem Cell-Like Characteristics.', 'Recapitulation of prostate tissue cell type-specific transcriptomes by an in vivo primary prostate tissue xenograft model.']"""

Under in vitro tumor co-culture conditions, the expression of full length and the truncated form of the NKG2D receptor in γδ T cells was significantly downregulated. Furthermore, using a newly established flow cytometry-based method to analyze histone acetylation (H3K9ac) in γδ T cells, we showed constitutive H3K9aclow and inducible H3K9achigh expression in Vδ2 T cells. The detailed analysis of H3K9aclow Vδ2 T cells revealed a significant reversion of TEMRA to TEM phenotype during in vitro co-culture with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma cells.

They are well-recognized therapy targets and their inhibition was shown to induce tumor volume reduction and chemosensitization in multiple cancer models. Oncogenic signaling is extremely complex and often cross-regulated. Designing molecular therapies and their combinations requires rational approaches to avoid redundant targeting or developing resistance. In this study, we have performed RNA transcriptome microarray analysis of two breast and two prostate metastatic cancer cell lines treated with siRNAs targeting SK1 or SK2. In prostate cancer cell lines SK1 knockdown (KD) has significantly changed expression of several genes including downregulation of NSUN2, G3BP2 and upregulation of ETS1. SK2 KD also affected expression of multiple genes including downregulation of CAPZA1 NSUN3 and ADPGK and upregulation of VDAC1, IBTK, ETS1, and MKNK2. Similarly, in breast cancer cells SK1 KD led to downregulation of NSUN2, NFATC3, CDK2, and G3BP2 and upregulation of GTF2B, TTC17, and RAB23. SK2 KD in breast cancer cells has decreased expression of ITGAV and CAPZA1 and increased expression of GTF2B and ST13. Gene-set enrichment analysis of known biochemical pathways showed that in prostate and breast cell lines SKs KD have altered multiple pathways. SK1 KD altered chromatin assembly, regulation of G1/S transition and mitosis, Wnt and MAP kinase signaling and cell motility. SK2 KD altered RAS protein signal transduction, regulation of MAP kinase and serine/threonine kinase activity, cell motility, small GTPase mediated signal transduction and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling. Through genome-wide microarray analysis, we have identified important molecular pathways affected by SK1 and SK2 KD. It appears that while KD of both genes leads to a decrease in individual pro-tumorigenic genes, there is a universal cellular response resulting in upregulation of several known pro-survival and pro-tumorigenic pathways such as MAPK, RAS, and PI3K, which may mediate cancer resistance to anti-SKs therapies. Our data point out to the potential advantage of certain molecular therapy combinations in targeting prostate and breast cancer. Further signaling studies are required to confirm the individual involvement of identified pathways.""","""['Heba Alshaker', 'Qi Wang', 'Daniel Brewer', 'Dmitri Pchejetski']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Front Pharmacol""","""['Sphingosine Kinase 1 in Breast Cancer-A New Molecular Marker and a Therapy Target.', 'Characterization of isoenzyme-selective inhibitors of human sphingosine kinases.', 'Ablation of sphingosine kinase-2 inhibits tumor cell proliferation and migration.', 'Proteasomal degradation of sphingosine kinase 1 and inhibition of dihydroceramide desaturase by the sphingosine kinase inhibitors, SKi or ABC294640, induces growth arrest in androgen-independent LNCaP-AI prostate cancer cells.', 'Role of sphingosine 1-phosphate receptors, sphingosine kinases and sphingosine in cancer and inflammation.', 'Loss of TTC17 promotes breast cancer metastasis through RAP1/CDC42 signaling and sensitizes it to rapamycin and paclitaxel.', 'Emerging Roles of Ceramides in Breast Cancer Biology and Therapy.', '5-methylcytosine RNA methyltransferases and their potential roles in cancer.', 'Sphingosine Kinase 1 Signaling in Breast Cancer: A Potential Target to Tackle Breast Cancer Stem Cells.', 'Advances in mRNA 5-methylcytosine modifications: Detection, effectors, biological functions, and clinical relevance.']"""

Numerous prostatic, nonprostatic lesions, and normal structures can be very similar to adenocarcinoma. A pathologist's awareness of the benign mimics is important for the diagnosis of PC.  Aim:   The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence, clinical, and histopathological features of PC, and its common mimics, and to study the criteria for their distinction from PC.  Materials and methods:   A prospective study of histopathological features of radical prostatectomy and transurethral resection of the prostate specimens, sent to the department of pathology in a medical college, for a period of 2 years was done. A brief clinical history followed by a clinical examination, including per-rectal findings and serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels, was noted.  Results:   After excluding all the cases of benign hyperplasia of prostate without any associated findings, 50 cases of operated surgical specimens of prostate were studied. PC was the most frequent diagnosis in 28 patients of 50 cases (56.0%). Basal cell hyperplasia formed the predominant mimic (26.0%), followed by prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (8%), prostate atrophy (4%), clear-cell cribriform hyperplasia(4%),, and one case of atypical adenomatous hyperplasia (2%). Serum PSA was >4 ng/mL in all the cases of PC. In three of the mimics, PSA was >4 ng/mL and in the rest it was <4 ng/mL. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was not applied in our study.  Conclusion:   Biopsy still remains a gold standard for diagnosis of PC and its mimics. All the lesions in the above study were diagnosed on routine hematoxylin and eosin staining. IHC is useful especially for lesions in the grey zone but not in routine histopathological study and should not be used as a screening test but should be applied in specific selected cases only.""","""['Qury S Mahapatra', 'Pranati Mohanty', 'Annu Nanda', 'Lity Mohanty']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Indian J Pathol Microbiol""","""['Followup interval prostate biopsy 3 years after diagnosis of high grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia is associated with high likelihood of prostate cancer, independent of change in prostate specific antigen levels.', 'Glycoprotein A-80 in the human prostate: immunolocalization in prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia, carcinoma, radiation failure, and after neoadjuvant hormonal therapy.', 'Distinguishing atrophy and high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia from prostatic adenocarcinoma with and without previous adjuvant hormone therapy with the aid of cytokeratin 5/6.', 'Immunohistochemistry in diagnostic surgical pathology of the prostate.', 'Prostate pathology: histologic and molecular perspectives.']"""

Settings and design:   It is a prospective study where 74 consecutive cases of urothelial carcinoma along with 10 cases each of prostatic adenocarcinoma (PC) and conventional clear cell renal cell carcinoma were included between August 2016 and January 2017.  Methods and materials:   All the cases were histopathologically evaluated and immunohistochemically stained for GATA binding protein 3. Only nuclear positivity was considered as positive. Immunoreactivity score for GATA expression was calculated based on the staining intensity as well as percentage.  Statistical analysis used:   The statistical analysis was done using Statistical Package for Social Sciences Version 15.0 statistical analysis software. P value of <0.05 was considered statistically significance.  Results:   GATA3 expressions were seen in 77% of the cases of urothelial carcinoma, whereas none of the clear cell renal cell carcinoma and prostatic adenocarcinoma cases was GATA3 positive. GATA3 expression significantly correlated with histological grade and muscle invasion with a weaker or negative expression in high-grade muscle invasive tumor as compared to low-grade and noninvasive neoplasm. Significantly weaker expression of GATA3 was found in cases with severe nuclear pleomorphism, mitosis >10/10 hpf, presence of necrosis, and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes. No significant change in the status of GATA3 expression was seen in follow-up cases between initial Transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT) and post-recurrence TURBT or radical cystectomy specimens.  Conclusions:   GATA3 as a sensitive and specific marker for urothelial carcinoma can be effectively used to exclude other genitourinary malignancies, PC, and renal cell carcinoma, at metastatic site. This marker can also be effectively used in predicting the probable grade and invasion in biopsy material with poor morphological characteristics, thereby helping in appropriate management in such cases.""","""['Harshita Agarwal', 'Suresh Babu', 'Chanchal Rana', 'Madhu Kumar', 'Atin Singhai', 'Shiv Narayan Shankhwar', 'Vishwajeet Singh', 'Rahul Janak Sinha']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Indian J Pathol Microbiol""","""['GATA3 immunohistochemistry in urothelial carcinoma of the upper urinary tract as a urothelial marker and a prognosticator.', 'GATA3 expression loss is linked to stage progression but is unrelated to prognosis in muscle-invasive urothelial carcinoma of the bladder.', 'Placental S100 (S100P) and GATA3: markers for transitional epithelium and urothelial carcinoma discovered by complementary DNA microarray.', 'Clear cell urothelial carcinoma of the urinary bladder: a case report and review of the literature.', 'Value of GATA3 immunostaining in tumor diagnosis: a review.', 'GATA3 Predicts the Tumor Microenvironment Phenotypes and Molecular Subtypes for Bladder Carcinoma.', 'Squamous cell and urothelial carcinomas in an ileal neobladder.', 'Molecular Markers in Urinary Bladder Cancer: Applications for Diagnosis, Prognosis and Therapy.', 'Diagnostic Relevance of GATA 3 Expression in Urinary Bladder Carcinoma of Divergent Differentiation and Other Histological Variants.', 'Association Between Estrogen Receptors and GATA3 in Bladder Cancer: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Their Clinicopathological Significance.']"""

Methods: A total of 50 patients who underwent prostate multiparametric MRI (mpMRI) with suspicious peripheral nodules were retrospectively enrolled, and all patients were biopsy-proven histologically. Two radiologists analyzed the position and category of peripheral zone lesions based on PI-RADS V2. Then 12 ADC quantitative parameters were calculated regarding each lesion on the ADC map by post-processing software. The lesions were divided into malignant group and benign group according to histopathological findings. The ADC quantitative parameters between groups were compared, and stepwise logistic regression analysis was used to build a discriminative model. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and decision curve analysis (DCA) were performed to evaluate the diagnostic power and clinical benefit. Results: Twenty-eight peripheral zone prostate malignant lesions and 25 benign lesions were obtained finally. The area under the ROC curve, sensitivity and specificity to differentiate peripheral zone prostate malignant from benign lesions were as follows: 0.803, 60.71%, 92.00% (PI-RADS V2 score), 0.857, 89.29%, 76.00% (ADC model), and 0.891, 71.43%, 92.00% (combined model), respectively.

Meanwhile, flutamide is a non-steroidal oral anti-androgen that was commonly used before the approval of bicalutamide. The objective of the OCUU-CRPC study is to compare the efficacy and safety between second-line hormonal therapy of enzalutamide and flutamide as alternative anti-androgen therapy (AAT) after combined androgen blockade (CAB) therapy that included bicalutamide in patients with CRPC.  Methods:   A total of 100 patients with CRPC with or without distant metastases after disease progression who received CAB therapy with bicalutamide were randomly assigned at a 1:1 ratio according to distant metastases to the enzalutamide (160 mg/day, 4 × 40 mg capsules once daily) and flutamide (375 mg/day; 3 × 125 mg tablets thrice daily) groups. The primary endpoint for the drug efficacy is the response rate of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) (i.e., the ratio of patients whose PSA declined by ≥50% from baseline) at 3 months. Meanwhile, the secondary endpoints are PSA progression rate at 3 and 6 months, PSA response rate at 6 months, change in quality of life, PSA progression-free survival, and safety. The patient registration started in January 2015 and will end in March 2018, and the follow-up period is 6 months after the last patient registration. The main result will be reported in March 2019.  Discussion:   In the OCUU-CRPC study, we compare the efficacy and safety of enzalutamide or alternative AAT with flutamide in participants with CRPC who were previously treated with a CAB therapy with bicalutamide. The expected results of this study will be that enzalutamide is superior to flutamide in terms of PSA response. A longer time to disease progression with enzalutamide over flutamide may translate to better overall survival. However, flutamide may be more accessible for patients owing to its lower cost than enzalutamide.

EXCELS is a randomized controlled trial to test the efficacy of patient-level self-management educational strategies on adherence to preventative health service use and cancer survivorship follow-up guidelines.  Methods:   The EXCELS trial compares four conditions: (1) EXCELS-website (e.g., a mobile-optimized technology platform); (2) EXCELS-health coaching; (3) EXCELS-website and health coaching; and (4) a print booklet. Approximately 480 breast, colorectal, and prostate survivors will be recruited through the New Jersey Primary Care Research Network (NJPCRN) and New Jersey State Cancer Registry (NJSCR). Eligible survivors (diagnosed stages 1-3) must have completed active treatment, access to a phone and a computer, smartphone or tablet with internet access, and be able to speak and read English.

It has been reported that α-Solanine exhibits anti-cancer activity and enhances the chemo- and radio-sensitivity in several human cancers, whereas the role of α-Solanine on radiosensitivity to PCa remains to be uncovered yet. We found α-Solanine decreased cell viability in human PCa cells rather than normal prostate epithelial cells in vitro. Functional experiments showed that cell viability and colonies formation were declined & apoptosis rate and DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) marker γ-H2AX expressions were elevated by α-Solanine in PCa cells treated with X-ray irradiation, compared with X-ray irradiation treatment only. GAS5 was down-regulated & miR-18a was up-regulated in PCa cells, which was reversed in the presence of α-Solanine. Effects of ectopic GAS5 on inhibiting cell viability and survival & promoting apoptosis and DNA damage were reversed by miR-18a overexpression in PCa cells.

This study intends to facilitate this process by proposing a patient-specific inverse planning algorithm for HDR prostate brachytherapy: GPU-based multi-criteria optimization (gMCO). Two GPU-based optimization engines including simulated annealing (gSA) and a quasi-Newton optimizer (gL-BFGS) were implemented to compute multiple plans in parallel. After evaluating the equivalence and the computation performance of these two optimization engines, one preferred optimization engine was selected for the gMCO algorithm. Five hundred sixty-two previously treated prostate HDR cases were divided into validation set (100) and test set (462). In the validation set, the number of Pareto optimal plans to achieve the best plan quality was determined for the gMCO algorithm. In the test set, gMCO plans were compared with the physician-approved clinical plans. Our results indicated that the optimization process is equivalent between gL-BFGS and gSA, and that the computational performance of gL-BFGS is up to 67 times faster than gSA. Over 462 cases, the number of clinically valid plans was 428 (92.6%) for clinical plans and 461 (99.8%) for gMCO plans. The number of valid plans with target [Formula: see text] coverage greater than 95% was 288 (62.3%) for clinical plans and 414 (89.6%) for gMCO plans. The mean planning time was 9.4 s for the gMCO algorithm to generate 1000 Pareto optimal plans. In conclusion, gL-BFGS is able to compute thousands of SA equivalent treatment plans within a short time frame. Powered by gL-BFGS, an ultra-fast and robust multi-criteria optimization algorithm was implemented for HDR prostate brachytherapy. Plan pools with various trade-offs can be created with this algorithm. A large-scale comparison against physician approved clinical plans showed that treatment plan quality could be improved and planning time could be significantly reduced with the proposed gMCO algorithm.""","""['Cédric Bélanger', 'Songye Cui', 'Yunzhi Ma', 'Philippe Després', 'J Adam M Cunha', 'Luc Beaulieu']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Phys Med Biol""","""['Evaluating the impact of real-time multicriteria optimizers integrated with interactive plan navigation tools for HDR brachytherapy.', 'Inter-observer evaluation of a GPU-based multicriteria optimization algorithm combined with plan navigation tools for HDR brachytherapy.', 'Catheters and dose optimization using a modified CVT algorithm and multi-criteria optimization in prostate HDR brachytherapy.', 'Optimization in treatment planning of high dose-rate brachytherapy - Review and analysis of mathematical models.', 'Emerging technologies in brachytherapy.', 'TrDosePred: A deep learning dose prediction algorithm based on transformers for head and neck cancer radiotherapy.', 'Commissioning of GPU-based multi-criteria optimizer combined with plan navigation tools for high-dose-rate brachytherapy.', 'Monte Carlo simulation of the effect of magnetic fields on brachytherapy dose distributions in lung tissue material.', 'Bi-objective optimization of catheter positions for high-dose-rate prostate brachytherapy.']"""

Inappropriate amounts of androgens have a severe adverse effect on men. Excessive androgen may contribute to accelerate prostatic hypertrophy, even prostate cancer, while the absence of androgen may result in reduced muscle mass and strength, decreased bone mass, low energy, diminished sexual function and an increased risk of osteoporosis and fracture. In these cases, androgen receptor modulators are important to maintain the normal biological function of AR. So androgen receptor modulators are necessary for human being to improve their happy life index. To explore the relationships between molecular structures and corresponding binding abilities to aid the new AR modulator design, multiple linear regressions (MLR) are employed to analyze a series of hydantoin analogues, which can bind to androgen receptor acting as AR modulators.

Fatigue after other prostate cancer (PCa) treatments is known to impact on patient-reported quality of life. The aim of this study was to characterise fatigue, physical activity levels and cardiovascular status post-RARP.  Methods:   Between October 2016 and March 2017, men post-RARP or on androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) were invited into the study. Participants were asked to complete the Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI) and Stage of Change and Scottish Physical Activity Questionnaires (SPAQ) over a 2-week period. Outcome measures were patient-reported fatigue, physical activity levels and the 10-year risk of cardiovascular disease (Q-Risk). Data were analysed in SPSS.  Results:   96/117 (82%) men approached consented to participate; of these, 62/96 (65%) returned complete questionnaire data (RARP n = 42, ADT n = 20). All men reported fatigue with 9/42 (21%) post-RARP reporting clinically significant fatigue. Physical activity did not correlate with fatigue. On average, both groups were overweight (BMI 27.0 ± 3.9 kg/m2 and 27.8 ± 12.3 kg/m2 for RARP and ADT, respectively) and the post-RARP group had an 18.1% ± 7.4% Q-Risk2 score.  Conclusions:   A proportion of men is at increased risk of cardiovascular disease within 10 years post-RARP and have substantial levels of fatigue; therefore, clinicians should consider including these factors when counselling patients about RARP.

Prostate carcinogenesis is driven by the accumulation of genetic and epigenetic aberrations, which regulate cancer cell transition between a stem- and nonstem-cell state and accelerate tumor evolution. Elevated expression of enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) histone methyltransferase, a core member of the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), results in cancer progression through histone methylation-driven tumor cells dedifferentiation. Previous studies demonstrated that tumor suppressor breast cancer 1 (BRCA1) is a negative regulator of PRC2-dependent H3K27 methylation. Our recent studies revealed that inhibition of EZH2-mediated histone methylation radiosensitizes prostate cancer stem cells (CSCs) population. However, the link between BRCA1 and EZH2 in regulation of prostate CSCs remains elusive. Present study demonstrated that BRCA1 and EZH2 are coregulated in patients' tumors and PCa cell lines, and cooperate in regulation of CSC phenotype and properties. Knockdown of BRCA1 expression significantly increases the number and the size of tumor spheres. Inhibition of BRCA1 and EZH2 expression leads to an increase of aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH)-positive cell population that is, at least partially, attributed to the upregulation of ALDH1A3 protein. Treatment with a global histone methylation inhibitor 3-Deazaneplanocin A abrogates this regulation, downregulates BRCA1 and EZH2 expression and has an inhibitory effect on the tumorigenic properties of radioresistant PCa cells in vivo. We found that EZH2/BRCA1 signaling mechanisms play an important role in the maintenance of prostate CSC properties and may be a promising target for tumor treatment.""","""['Ielizaveta Gorodetska', 'Vasyl Lukiyanchuk', 'Claudia Peitzsch', 'Iryna Kozeretska', 'Anna Dubrovska']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Int J Cancer""","""['BRCA1 is a negative modulator of the PRC2 complex.', 'MUC1-C activates EZH2 expression and function in human cancer cells.', 'Resveratrol modulates epigenetic regulators of promoter histone methylation and acetylation that restores BRCA1, p53, p21CIP1 in human breast cancer cell lines.', 'Mutations and deletions of PRC2 in prostate cancer.', 'Structural assembly of Polycomb group protein and Insight of EZH2 in cancer progression: A review.', 'Lineage plasticity and treatment resistance in prostate cancer: the intersection of genetics, epigenetics, and evolution.', 'Neural induction drives body axis formation during embryogenesis, but a neural induction-like process drives tumorigenesis in postnatal animals.', 'Identification of cervical cancer stem cells using single-cell transcriptomes of normal cervix, cervical premalignant lesions, and cervical cancer.', 'State-of-the-art therapeutic strategies for targeting cancer stem cells in prostate cancer.', 'Novel insights into histone lysine methyltransferases in cancer therapy: From epigenetic regulation to selective drugs.']"""

Among these, seven mutations were novel, including four BRCA1 mutations (c.123_124delCAinsAT, c.5093_5096delCTAA, c.5396-2A>G, and c.2054delinsGAAGAGTAACAAGTAAGAAGAGTAACAAGAAG), and three BRCA2 mutations (c.304A>T, c.7552_7553insT, and c.9548_9549insA). The BRCA1/2 variants were identified in 14% (8/57) of the patients with triple-negative breast cancer and in 6.3% (10/159) of the patients with non-triple-negative breast cancer. There was no significant difference between the two groups (p = 0.07). A higher frequency for BRCA1 mutations was observed in patients with triple-negative breast cancer than in those with non-triple-negative breast cancer (12.3% vs. 2.5%, p = 0.004). The frequencies of the BRCA2 mutations were not significantly different between patients with triple-negative breast cancer and those with non-triple-negative breast cancer (1.8% vs. 3.8%, p = 0.46).  Conclusion:   We found that patients with triple-negative breast cancer had a higher frequency of BRCA1 mutations than those with non-triple-negative breast cancer. In this study, no significant associations between the BRCA1/2 mutation status and age, family history of breast cancer, ovarian cancer, pancreatic cancer and prostate cancer, number of primary lesions, tumor size, or lymph node metastasis were observed.""","""['Xiaozhen Wang', 'Haimeng Liu', 'Amina Maimaitiaili', 'Gang Zhao', 'Sijie Li', 'Zheng Lv', 'Di Wu', 'Aiping Shi', 'Xin Guan', 'Hongyao Jia', 'Menghan Li', 'Dong Song', 'Lihua Kang', 'Bing Han', 'Tong Fu', 'Ming Yang', 'Zhu Zhu', 'Ye Du', 'Yanqiu Song', 'Jinghui Hong', 'Zhimin Fan']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Mol Genet Genomic Med""","""['The prevalence of BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations among young Mexican women with triple-negative breast cancer.', 'Evaluation of BRCA1/2 mutational status among German and Austrian women with triple-negative breast cancer.', 'Molecular characterization and clinical interpretation of BRCA1/BRCA2 variants in families from Murcia (south-eastern Spain) with hereditary breast and ovarian cancer: clinical-pathological features in BRCA carriers and non-carriers.', 'Variants of uncertain clinical significance in hereditary breast and ovarian cancer genes: best practices in functional analysis for clinical annotation.', 'Non-surgical prevention strategies in women with hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndromes.', 'A comparison of Chinese multicenter breast cancer database and SEER database.', 'Frequency of mutations in BRCA genes and other candidate genes in high-risk probands or probands with breast or ovarian cancer in the Czech Republic.', 'The Emerging Role of Major Regulatory RNAs in Cancer Control.']"""

We hypothesize that GRS is a valid tool for risk assessment of most common cancers.  Methods:   Utilizing genotype and phenotype data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE), we tested 11 cancer-specific GRSs (bladder, breast, colorectal, glioma, lung, melanoma, ovarian, pancreatic, prostate, renal, and thyroid cancer) for association with the respective cancer type. Cancer-specific GRSs were calculated, for the first time in these cohorts, based on previously published risk-associated SNPs using the Caucasian subjects in these two cohorts.  Results:   Mean cancer-specific GRS in the population controls of eMERGE approximated the expected value of 1.00 (between 0.98 and 1.02) for all 11 types of cancer. Mean cancer-specific GRS was consistently higher in respective cancer patients than controls for all 11 types of cancer (P < 0.05). When subjects were categorized into low-, average-, and high-risk groups based on cancer-specific GRS (<0.5, 0.5-1.5, and >1.5, respectively), significant dose-response associations of higher cancer-specific GRS with higher OR of respective type of cancer were found for nine types of cancer (P-trend < 0.05). More than 64% subjects in the population controls of eMERGE can be classified as high risk for at least one type of these cancers.  Conclusion:   Validity of GRS for predicting cancer risk is demonstrated for most types of cancer.

B12 IgG was further evaluated as a near-infrared (NIR) optical imaging probe in R1-EnzRFAP and parental xenograft models. High tumor uptake and retention of the NIR probe was observed in the R1-EnzRFAP xenografts, and endogenous expression of murine stromal origin FAP was detected in the parental xenografts.

While prostatitis-characterized by pain and voiding symptoms, no clear etiology, and functional and quality of life impairments-co-occurs with other urinary conditions, the degree of shared overlapping etiologic processes among them remains unclear. We examined the contribution of genetic and environmental factors to these conditions and the etiology of their associations at the level of genetic and environmental influences.  Methods:   4380 monozygotic and dizygotic male twin pairs from the Vietnam Era Twin Registry reported lifetime physician-diagnosed prostatitis (combined acute and chronic), bladder problems, enlarged prostate/BPH, and CaP. Multivariate biometrical modeling estimated the magnitude of genetic and environmental influences for each condition, as well as their genetic and environmental covariance. The common pathway model tested the assumption that covariation among these urinary conditions is determined by a single latent factor.  Results:   Overall prevalence of prostatitis was 2.7%. Heritability estimates ranged from 19% for bladder problems to 42% for CaP. Significant shared environmental influences were present for CaP (12%), enlarged prostate/BPH (10%) but were smaller than genetic influences. A reduced one factor common pathway model provided the best fit, suggesting that covariation among the conditions is determined by a shared latent factor.  Conclusion:   We identified a common, genetically-influenced factor that accounts for much of the comorbidity among these 4 disease conditions.

IRE has been shown to have preserving properties towards vessels and nerves and the extracellular matrix. This makes IRE an ideal candidate to treat prostate cancer (PCa) where other treatment modalities frequently unselectively destroy surrounding structures inducing severe side effects like incontinence or impotence. We report the retrospective assessment of 471 IRE treatments in 429 patients of all grades and stages of PCa with 6-year maximum follow-up time.  Material and findings:   The patient cohort consisted of low (25), intermediate (88) and high-risk cancers (312). All had multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging, and 199 men had additional 3D-mapping biopsy for diagnostic work-up prior to IRE. Patients were treated either focally (123), sub-whole-gland (154), whole-gland (134) or for recurrent disease (63) after previous radical prostatectomy, radiation therapy, etc. Adverse effects were mild (19.7%), moderate (3.7%) and severe (1.4%), never life-threatening. Urinary continence was preserved in all cases. IRE-induced erectile dysfunction persisted in 3% of the evaluated cases 12 months post treatment. Mean transient IIEF-5-Score reduction was 33% within 12-month post IRE follow-up and 15% after 12 months. Recurrences within the follow-up period occurred in 10% of the treated men, 23 in or adjacent to the treatment field and 18 outside the treatment field (residuals). Including residuals for worst case analysis, Kaplan Maier estimation on recurrence rate at 5 years resulted in 5.6% (CI95: 1.8-16.93) for Gleason 6, 14.6% (CI95: 8.8-23.7) for Gleason 7 and 39.5% (CI95: 23.5-61.4) for Gleason 8-10.  Conclusion:   The results indicate comparable efficacy of IRE to standard radical prostatectomy in terms of 5-year recurrence rates and better preservation of urogenital function, proving the safety and suitability of IRE for PCa treatment. The data also shows that IRE, besides focal therapy of early PCa, can also be used for whole-gland ablations, in patients with recurrent PCa, and as a problem-solver for local tumor control in T4-cancers not amenable to surgery and radiation therapy anymore.""","""['E Guenther', 'N Klein', 'S Zapf', 'S Weil', 'C Schlosser', 'B Rubinsky', 'M K Stehling']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Focal irreversible electroporation for prostate cancer: functional outcomes and short-term oncological control.', 'Focal vs extended ablation in localized prostate cancer with irreversible electroporation; a multi-center randomized controlled trial.', 'Outcomes of salvage radical prostatectomy after initial irreversible electroporation treatment for recurrent prostate cancer.', 'Irreversible Electroporation for the Ablation of Prostate Cancer.', 'Irreversible electroporation (IRE): a narrative review of the development of IRE from the laboratory to a prostate cancer treatment.', 'Pulsed Electric Fields in Oncology: A Snapshot of Current Clinical Practices and Research Directions from the 4th World Congress of Electroporation.', 'Focal Irreversible Electroporation for Localized Prostate Cancer - Oncological and Safety Outcomes Using mpMRI and Transperineal Biopsy Follow-Up.', 'Engineering the Tumor Immune Microenvironment through Minimally Invasive Interventions.', 'Liver tissue remodeling following ablation with irreversible electroporation in a porcine model.', 'Electroporation and Immunotherapy-Unleashing the Abscopal Effect.']"""

Materials and methods:   One hundred four PZ lesions in 85 patients who underwent magnetic resonance imaging were retrospectively analyzed with apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) mapping, MRF, and targeted biopsy (cognitive or in-gantry). A radiologist blinded to pathology drew regions of interest on targeted lesions and visually normal peripheral zone on MRF and ADC maps. Mean T1, T2, and ADC were analyzed using linear mixed models. Generalized estimating equations logistic regression analyses were used to evaluate T1 and T2 relaxometry combined with ADC in differentiating pathologic groups.  Results:   Targeted biopsy revealed 63 cancers (low-grade cancer/Gleason score 6 = 10, clinically significant cancer/Gleason score ≥7 = 53), 15 prostatitis, and 26 negative biopsies. Prostate cancer T1, T2, and ADC (mean ± SD, 1660 ± 270 milliseconds, 56 ± 20 milliseconds, 0.70 × 10 ± 0.24 × 10 mm/s) were significantly lower than prostatitis (mean ± SD, 1730 ± 350 milliseconds, 77 ± 36 milliseconds, 1.00 × 10 ± 0.30 × 10 mm/s) and negative biopsies (mean ± SD, 1810 ± 250 milliseconds, 71 ± 37 milliseconds, 1.00 × 10 ± 0.33 × 10 mm/s). For cancer versus prostatitis, ADC was sensitive and T2 specific with comparable area under curve (AUC; (AUCT2 = 0.71, AUCADC = 0.79, difference between AUCs not significant P = 0.37). T1 + ADC (AUCT1 + ADC = 0.83) provided the best separation between cancer and negative biopsies. Low-grade cancer T2 and ADC (mean ± SD, 75 ± 29 milliseconds, 0.96 × 10 ± 0.34 × 10 mm/s) were significantly higher than clinically significant cancers (mean ± SD, 52 ± 16 milliseconds, 0.65 ± 0.18 × 10 mm/s), and T2 + ADC (AUCT2 + ADC = 0.91) provided the best separation.

Methods:   This was an analysis of the first 30 consecutive patients who underwent Lu-PSMA therapy. Biochemical response was defined as prostate-specific antigen decrease of 50% or greater. Clinical toxicity was based on standardized physician's report, and biochemical and hematological toxicity was graded according to the Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) criteria. Clinical response was objectified in terms of severity of pain and usage of analgesics after separate treatment cycles.  Results:   Thirty patients with advanced PCa received therapy cycles with 6 GBq Lu-PSMA (median, 4; range, 1-6). After the first cycle, usage of analgesics decreased in 45% of the patients. During treatment, maximum prostate-specific antigen decrease was 50% or greater and 90% or greater in 57% and 24% of the patients, respectively. Despite CTCAE grades III and IV anemia occurring in 2 patients (7%), all other newly originated biochemical toxicity was limited to maximum CTCAE grades I and II. Grade II xerostomia occurred in 17% of the patients. During a median follow-up length of 13.7 months (range, 9.8-32.3 months), median overall survival from start of the first therapy cycle was 11.3 months (range, 1.4-32.3 months).  Conclusions:   These results confirm the favorable safety and efficacy profile of Lu-PSMA, even up to 6 treatment cycles. Therefore, Lu-PSMA seems a promising therapeutic strategy for metastatic castration-resistant PCa patients.

Double positive (DP) CD4+CD8+ T cells remain understudied, although they were already described in human cancers, with conflicting data regarding their role. Here, we quantified and phenotypically/functionally characterized DP T cells in blood from urological cancer patients. We analyzed blood leukocytes of 24 healthy donors (HD) and 114 patients with urological cancers, including bladder (n = 54), prostate (n = 31), and kidney (n = 29) cancer patients using 10-color flow cytometry. As compared to HD, levels of circulating DP T cells were elevated in all urological cancer patients, which could be attributed to increased frequencies of both CD4highCD8low and CD4+CD8high DP T-cell subsets. Of note, most CD4highCD8low DP T cells show a CD8αα phenotype, whereas CD4+CD8high cells express both CD8α and CD8β subunits. Functional properties were investigated using ex-vivo generated DP T-cell clones. DP T cells from patients were skewed toward an effector memory phenotype, along with enhanced Th2 cytokine production. Interestingly, both CD8αα and CD8αβ DP T cells were able to trigger Th2 polarization of naïve CD4 T cells, while restraining Th1 induction.

In this study, a significantly higher expression level of integrin β3 was observed in aggressive prostate cancer (PCa) cells; PC3, that lack the expression of PDEF, was confirmed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and the immunoblot analysis. Dual immunofluorescence studies have confirmed the lower expression of PDEF and higher expression level of integrin β3 in PCa cells compared with non-tumorigenic prostate epithelial RWPE-1 cells. Then, it was attempted to identify integrin β3-mediated downstream signaling pathways that modulate actin cytoskeleton remodeling in PCa cells. Inhibition of PDEF by RNA interference (PDEFKD ) in DU145 cells confirmed by transcript and western blot analysis, exhibited significantly higher expression level of integrin β3 and its downstream signaling molecules talin and paxillin, associated with promoting migration and invasion of cells. Given the involvement of integrin-mediated invasion of cells, PDEFKD DU145 cells were treated with Echistatin, a potent integrin β3-specific antagonist and found that the cells significantly reduced the transcript and protein expression levels of talin and paxillin; and reduced the invasion of cells.

Because there are few therapeutic interventions for men on active surveillance for prostate cancer to reduce the risk of cancer progression, dietary approaches are an appealing option for patients.  Objective:   We evaluated whether consumption of a glucoraphanin-rich broccoli soup for 1 y leads to changes in gene expression in prostate tissue of men with localized prostate cancer.  Methods:   Forty-nine men on active surveillance completed a 3-arm parallel randomized double-blinded intervention study for 12 mo and underwent transperineal template biopsy procedures and dietary assessment at the start and end of the study. Patients received a weekly 300 mL portion of soup made from a standard broccoli (control) or from 1 of 2 experimental broccoli genotypes with enhanced concentrations of glucoraphanin, delivering 3 and 7 times that of the control, respectively. Gene expression in tissues from each patient obtained before and after the dietary intervention was quantified by RNA sequencing followed by gene set enrichment analyses.  Results:   In the control arm, there were several hundred changes in gene expression in nonneoplastic tissue during the 12 mo. These were associated with an increase in expression of potentially oncogenic pathways including inflammation processes and epithelial-mesenchymal transition. Changes in gene expression and associated oncogenic pathways were attenuated in men on the glucoraphanin-rich broccoli soup in a dose-dependent manner. Although the study was not powered to assess clinical progression, an inverse association between consumption of cruciferous vegetables and cancer progression was observed.

Overall, subjects had held 19 462 paid jobs lasting ≥1 year, including 3655 short-term jobs. Using information from interviews and from the Canadian Classification and Dictionary of Occupations, we characterized short-term jobs and compared them to jobs held ≥2 years.  Results:   Short-term jobs represented <4% of subjects' work years on average. Forty-five per cent of subjects had at least one short-term job; of these, 49% had one, 24% had two, and 27% had at least three. Half of all short-term jobs had been held before the age of 24. Short-term jobs entailed more often exposure to fumes, odours, dust, and/or poor ventilation than longer jobs (17 versus 13%), as well as outdoor work (10 versus 5%) and heavy physical activity (16 versus 12%).  Conclusions:   Short-term jobs occurred often in early careers and more frequently entailed potentially hazardous exposures than longer-held jobs. However, as they represented a small proportion of work years, excluding them should have a marginal impact on lifetime exposure assessment.""","""['Marie-Élise Parent', 'Hugues Richard', 'Jean-François Sauvé']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Ann Work Expo Health""","""['What Should We Do with Short-Term Jobs in Studies of Chronic Diseases?', 'Systematically extracting metal- and solvent-related occupational information from free-text responses to lifetime occupational history questionnaires.', 'Retrospective Assessment of Occupational Exposures for the GENEVA Study of ALS among Military Veterans.', 'Do Women and Men Have the Same Patterns of Multiple Occupational Carcinogenic Exposures?

This study aims to detect the role of lncRNA small nucleolar RNA host gene 15 (SNHG15) in human prostate cancer. Using qRT-PCR analysis, we identified the upregulation of SNHG15 in PCa cell lines. Loss-of function assays were conducted to determine the regulatory effect of SNHG15 on PCa cell proliferation, migration and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). According to the results of functional assays, we found that knockdown of SNHG15 impaired cell viability, suppressed cell proliferation, inhibited cell migration and invasion, reversed EMT progress. All these findings revealed the oncogenic function of SNHG15 in PCa. Mechanism investigation revealed that SNHG15 was located in the cytoplasm of PCa cells and acted as a molecular sponge of microRNA-338-3p (miR-338-3p). Moreover, FKBP prolyl isomerase 1A (FKBP1A) was a target of miR-338-3p. This investigation demonstrated that SNHG15 may serve as a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) to regulate miR-338-3p and FKBP1A.

Microultrasound (mUS) is a novel technology capable of providing high-resolution images of the prostate.  Objective:   To test the feasibility of high-resolution mUS in patients diagnosed with BC and its ability to differentiate between non-muscle-invasive BC (NMIBC) and muscle-invasive BC (MIBC).  Design, setting, and participants:   This is an observational prospective study performed in 23 patients with a diagnosis of primary BC scheduled for an endoscopic treatment.  Surgical procedure:   Micro-US was performed before transurethral resection of bladder tumor using the ExactVu system with an EV29L 29-MHz side-fire transducer (Exact Imaging, Markham, Canada).  Measurements:   The endpoints were to test the feasibility, describe the normal bladder wall anatomy, identify the lesions, and compare the mUS findings with the histopathological results.  Results and limitations:   Micro-US was accurate in differentiating the three layers of the bladder wall in all cases. Bladder cancers were clearly identified as heterogeneous structures protruding from the normal bladder wall. In 14 cases the lesions appeared confined to the lamina propria, and in all cases NMIBC was confirmed by the final pathological report. In the other patients, the lesions seemed to extend into the muscular layer, but MIBC was confirmed in five out of seven cases (71.4%) from the pathologist. The small sample size was the main limitation of the current study.  Conclusions:   Our findings showed that mUS is able to differentiate the bladder wall layers and identify the bladder cancer stage. Further studies with a larger population and imaging correlation with MRI are warranted before its introduction in clinical practice.

However, the mechanisms by which BPA contributes to carcinogenesis are unclear. This study aims to clarify its toxic effects on mitotic cells and investigate the molecular mechanism. In vitro effects of BPA on mitotic progression were examined by performing experiments on HeLa cells. Proteins involved in mitotic processes were detected by Western blot, live cell imaging, and immunofluorescence staining. The results showed that BPA increased chromosomal instability by perturbing mitotic processes such as bipolar spindle formation and spindle microtubule attachment to the kinetochore. BPA prolonged mitotic progression by disturbing spindle attachment and concomitant activating spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC). Mechanistically, BPA interfered proper localization of HURP to the proximal ends of spindle microtubules, Kif2a to the minus ends of spindle microtubules, and TPX2 on the mitotic spindle. This mislocalization of microtubule associated proteins (MAPs) is postulated to lead to spindle attachment failure. Furthermore, BPA caused multipolar spindle by inducing centriole overduplication and premature disengagement. Although BPA acts as an estrogen receptor (ER) agonist, mitotic defects caused by BPA occurred in an ER-independent manner.

In addition, the combination of UA with Tam or Enz remarkably induced more cell cycle arrest at the G0/G1 phase and apoptosis than only drug-treated cells (P < 0.01). Consequently, our findings suggest that the combination of UA with Tam or Enz may be a potential therapeutic approach for the treatment of BC and PC and further studies are required to exploit the potential mechanisms of synergistic effects.""","""['Gamze Guney Eskiler', 'Isil Ezgi Eryilmaz', 'Beste Yurdacan', 'Unal Egeli', 'Gulsah Cecener', 'Berrin Tunca']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""J Biochem Mol Toxicol""","""['In vitro cytotoxic and antiproliferative effects of usnic acid on hormone-dependent breast and prostate cancer cells.', 'Genistein sensitizes inhibitory effect of tamoxifen on the growth of estrogen receptor-positive and HER2-overexpressing human breast cancer cells.', 'Hesperidin, piperine and bee venom synergistically potentiate the anticancer effect of tamoxifen against breast cancer cells.', 'Tumor growth inhibition, apoptosis, and Bcl-2 down-regulation of MCF-7ras tumors by sodium phenylacetate and tamoxifen combination.', 'Novel combination therapy against metastatic and androgen-independent prostate cancer by using gefitinib, tamoxifen and etoposide.', 'Evaluation of Usnea barbata (L.)

Methods:   Consecutive men with post-RARP LUTS, who were referred for specialist evaluation and urodynamics between December 2012 and October 2017, were evaluated. Men were invited to complete the International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire on Male Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms Long Form (ICIQ-MLUTS) pre-operatively and at 6, 12 and 18 months post-RARP.  Results:   In total 64/860 (7.4%) men post-RARP were referred for specialist evaluation. There was a significant increase in total ICIQ-MLUTS and bother scores at 6, 12 and 18 months compared with the baseline in these men (P < 0.001 and P < 0.05, respectively). Urodynamics identified 41/64 (64%) had urodynamic stress incontinence (USI) only, 2/64 (3%) had detrusor overactivity (DO) only and 11/64 (17%) had a combination of USI and DO. Of those referred to a continence specialist 29/64 (45%) underwent a continence procedure.  Conclusions:   Patients with bothersome LUTS post-RARP have higher baseline ICIQ-MLUTs scores and significant worsening of total scores at all time points compared with the baseline. Routine use of PROMs may identify patients at risk of bothersome symptoms after RARP and prompt earlier referral for further management of their LUTS. Urodynamic evaluation revealed that the most common finding was pure stress incontinence but the range of urodynamic diagnoses highlights the need to perform urodynamics before making treatment decisions for men with LUTS post-RARP.""","""['Kenneth R MacKenzie', 'James Davis', 'Christopher Harding', 'Jonathan J Aning']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Neurourol Urodyn""","""['Detailed analysis of patient-reported lower urinary tract symptoms and effect on quality of life after robotic radical prostatectomy.', 'Longitudinal change of comprehensive lower urinary tract symptoms and various types of urinary incontinence during robot-assisted radical prostatectomy.', 'Clinical and Patient-reported Outcome Measures in Men Referred for Consideration of Surgery to Treat Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms: Baseline Results and Diagnostic Findings of the Urodynamics for Prostate Surgery Trial; Randomised Evaluation of Assessment Methods (UPSTREAM).', 'Systematic review and meta-analysis of studies reporting urinary continence recovery after robot-assisted radical prostatectomy.', 'Invasive urodynamic studies for the management of lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) in men with voiding dysfunction.', 'Preoperative exercise interventions to optimize continence outcomes following radical prostatectomy.', 'Lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) before and after robotic-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy: does improvement of LUTS mitigate worsened incontinence after robotic prostatectomy?']"""

We investigated if similar clinically relevant subgroups can be identified simply by the combination of two immunohistochemistry markers: one for tumor cell differentiation (prostate specific antigen, PSA) and one for proliferation (Ki67). This was analyzed in men with prostate cancer diagnosed at transurethral resection of the prostate 1975-1991 (n = 331) where the majority was managed by watchful waiting. Ki67 and PSA immunoreactivity was related to outcome and to tumor characteristics previously associated with prognosis. Increased Ki67 and decreased PSA were associated with poor outcome, and they provided independent prognostic information from Gleason score. A combinatory score for PSA and Ki67 immunoreactivity was produced using the median PSA and Ki67 levels as cut-off (for Ki67 the upper quartile was also evaluated) for differentiation into subgroups. Patients with PSA low/Ki67 high tumors showed higher Gleason score, more advanced tumor stage, and higher risk of prostate cancer death compared to other patients. Their tumor epithelial cells were often ERG positive and expressed higher levels of ErbB2, phosphorylated epidermal growth factor receptor (pEGF-R) and protein kinase B (pAkt), and their tumor stroma showed a reactive response with type 2 macrophage infiltration, high density of blood vessels and hyaluronic acid, and with reduced levels of caveolin-1, androgen receptors, and mast cells. In contrast, men with PSA high/Ki67 low tumors were characterized by low Gleason score, and the most favorable outcome amongst PSA/Ki67-defined subgroups. Men with PSA low/Ki67 low tumors showed clinical and tumor characteristics intermediate of the two groups above.

The IMPACT registry trial demonstrated a 4.1 month survival benefit, but not a consistent PSA response or improvement in progression-free survival. Based upon several factors, including this lack of objective treatment response, sipuleucel-T has been under-utilized in this patient population, despite current NCCN recommendations.  Methods:   In order to explore if delayed treatment response occurs in a subset of patients, we performed a single institutional retrospective analysis of mCRPC patients treated with sipuleucel-T and ongoing ADT alone. Within that group, we then identified a subset of sipuleucel-T-treated men with long-term disease control and no additional interventions. To independently confirm this finding, we evaluated a total of 336 patients from 4 large urology group practices treated with sipuleucel-T between 2010 and 2014 and identified 44 patients who met the same criteria and demonstrated evidence of PSA stabilization post sipuleucel-T treatment.

Methods:   We prospectively recruited incident PC cases (n = 254) and controls (n = 328) at the Durham Veteran Affairs, from 2007 to 2018. From a self-completed 61-item Food Frequency Questionnaire, we calculated dietary inflammatory index (DII®) scores with and without supplements. We examined the association between DII scores with and without supplements and overall PC risk using logistic regression and risk of low-grade PC (grade group 1) and high-grade PC (grade group 2-5) with multinomial logistic regression.  Results:   Cases were more likely to be Black (58 vs. 42%), had higher PSA (6.4 vs. 0.8 ng/ml), lower BMI (29.1 vs. 30.6 kg/m2) and were older (64 vs. 62 years) versus controls (all p < 0.01). Both black controls and cases had higher DII scores with and without supplements, though the DII scores with supplements in controls was not significant. On multivariable analysis, there were no associations between DII with or without supplements and overall PC risk (p-trend = 0.14, p-trend = 0.09, respectively) or low-grade PC (p-trend = 0.72, p-trend = 0.47, respectively). Higher DII scores with (p-trend = 0.04) and without supplements (p = 0.08) were associated with high-grade PC, though the association for DII without supplements was not significant.  Conclusions:   A pro-inflammatory diet was more common among Black men and associated with high-grade PC in our case-control study.

Methods:   Using the 20% Medicare sample, total charges for 1 year following an initial diagnosis of prostate cancer were abstracted from Medicare claims. Prostate cancer expenditures were calculated by subtracting total charges from the year prior to diagnosis. Propensity score weighting was used to balance baseline characteristics of men treated in ACOs and non-ACOs, and between treatment modalities (radiation, prostatectomy, and expectant management). A propensity score weighted regression model was then used to estimate mean expenditures for men with prostate cancer treated in ACOs and non ACOs and to test the association between ACO status and costs.  Results:   We identified 3297 men treated in ACOs for localized prostate cancer versus 24,088 in the non-ACO cohort. The weighted total charges for each treatment modality were $32,358 (radiation), $27,662 (prostatectomy), and $11,134 (expectant management). In our propensity score weighted regression model, the association between charges and ACO status was not significant, nor was the interaction between treatment type and costs. This was true both overall, and in a stratified analysis by treatment type.  Conclusions:   There was no significant difference in Medicare spending on prostate cancer care based on provider ACO affiliation, regardless of treatment type. Although the effects of ACOs on clinical care are complex, this study adds to a growing body of evidence suggesting that ACOs fail to achieve significantly lower charges in certain clinical settings.""","""['Alexander P Cole', 'Anna Krasnova', 'Ashwin Ramaswamy', 'David F Friedlander', 'Sean A Fletcher', 'Maxine Sun', 'Toni K Choueiri', 'Joel S Weissman', 'Adam S Kibel', 'Quoc-Dien Trinh']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Prostate Cancer Prostatic Dis""","""['Savings or Selection?

ZFHX3 is integral to proper functions of ESR1 (i.e., estrogen receptor alpha (ERα)), which belongs to the same family of proteins as ESR2, but is hardly expressed in prostate epithelial cells. It is not clear how ZFHX3 suppresses prostatic tumorigenesis. In this study, we investigated whether ZFHX3 and ERβ functionally interact with each other in the suppression of prostatic tumorigenesis. In two androgen receptor (AR)-positive prostate cancer cell lines, C4-2B and LNCaP, we first validated ERβ's tumor suppressor activity indicated by the inhibition of cell proliferation and repression of MYC expression. We found that loss of ZFHX3 increased cell proliferation and MYC expression, and downregulation of MYC was necessary for ZFHX3 to inhibit cell proliferation in the same cell lines. Importantly, loss of ZFHX3 prevented ERβ from suppressing cell proliferation and repressing MYC transcription. Biochemically, ERβ and ZFHX3 physically interacted with each other and they both occupied the same region of the common MYC promoter, even though ZFHX3 also bound to another region of the MYC promoter. Higher levels of ZFHX3 and ERβ in human prostate cancer tissue samples correlated with better patient survival. These findings establish MYC repression as a mechanism for ZFHX3's tumor suppressor activity and ZFHX3 as an indispensable factor for ERβ's tumor suppressor activity in prostate cancer cells. Our data also suggest that intact ZFHX3 function is required for using ERβ-selective agonists to effectively treat prostate cancer.""","""['Qingxia Hu', 'Baotong Zhang', 'Rui Chen', 'Changying Fu', 'Jun A', 'Xing Fu', 'Juan Li', 'Liya Fu', 'Zhiqian Zhang', 'Jin-Tang Dong']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Oncogenesis""","""['AR imposes different effects on ZFHX3 transcription depending on androgen status in prostate cancer cells.', 'Additive Effect of Zfhx3/Atbf1 and Pten Deletion on Mouse Prostatic Tumorigenesis.', 'ZFHX3 Promotes the Proliferation and Tumor Growth of ER-Positive Breast Cancer Cells Likely by Enhancing Stem-Like Features and MYC and TBX3 Transcription.', 'The role of Eralpha and ERbeta in the prostate: insights from genetic models and isoform-selective ligands.', 'Estrogen and prostate cancer: an eclipsed truth in an androgen-dominated scenario.', 'WFDC3 inhibits tumor metastasis by promoting the ERβ-mediated transcriptional repression of TGFBR1 in colorectal cancer.', 'To be, or not to be: the dilemma of immunotherapy for non-small cell lung cancer harboring various driver mutations.', 'Genomic, epigenomic, and transcriptomic signatures of prostate cancer between African American and European American patients.', 'ATBF1 is a potential diagnostic marker of histological grade and functions via WNT5A in breast cancer.', 'A six-gene prognostic signature for both adult and pediatric acute myeloid leukemia identified with machine learning.']"""

We evaluated the safety, sensitivity, and impact on patient management of 18F-DCFPyL in the setting of biochemical recurrence of prostate cancer. Methods: Subjects with prostate cancer and biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy or curative-intent radiotherapy were included in this prospective study. The subjects underwent 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT imaging. The localization and number of lesions were recorded. The uptake characteristics of the 5 most active lesions were measured. A pre- and posttest questionnaire was sent to treating physicians to assess the impact on management. Results: One hundred thirty subjects were evaluated. 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT localized recurrent prostate cancer in 60% of cases with a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level of ≥0.4 to <0.5, 78% with a level of ≥0.5 to <1.0, 72% with a level of ≥1.0 to <2.0, and 92% with a level of ≥2.0. Many subjects had few lesions (1 lesion in 40.8%, 2 in 8.5%, and 3 in 4.6%). The number of lesions was significantly related to PSA by ANOVA, but there was a large overlap in the PSA values for number of lesion categories. Total lesion uptake was also significantly related to PSA level. A change in treatment intent occurred in 65.5% of subjects, disease stage changed in 65.5%, and management plans changed in 87.3%.

The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of unrenormalized absolute SC on 68Ga-PSMA PET quantification in PET/MRI of the prostate in 100 patients. Methods: The PET data of 100 patients were reconstructed twice using standard SC and improved unrenormalized SC. The visual presence of the halo artifact was rated in each PET data reconstruction using 5 grades (0, no halo artifact; 4, severe halo artifact). The number of visible lesions in the pelvis was recorded. SUVmean and SUVmax were measured in the lesions, in the bladder, in the gluteus maximus, and within the halo margin. Furthermore, the signal-to-noise-ratio and image noise were measured in all PET data. Relative differences between standard and unrenormalized SC were calculated. Results: With standard SC, the average grade in the presence of the halo artifact was 2 (moderate halo artifact), whereas for unrenormalized SC, the average grade was 0.9 (slight halo artifact). The same number of congruent lesions (n = 74) was detected for both PET data reconstructions. Relative changes in PET signal-to-noise-ratio and image noise were not statistically significant (P > 0.05). The mean (±SD) increase in SUVmean using unrenormalized SC was 23.0% ± 9.2% in the gluteus maximus, 7.1% ± 4.5% in the bladder, 325.4% ± 748.5% in the halo margin, and 12.4% ± 16.8% in all 74 detected lesions.

However, cancer abutting or focally extending beyond the prostate capsule increases the risk of a positive surgical margin.  Objective:   To evaluate the accuracy of our new three-dimensional (3D) elastic augmented-reality (AR) system in identifying capsular involvement (CI) location of PCa during the NS phase of robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP). Secondarily, the accuracy of this technology was compared with two-dimensional (2D)-based cognitive procedures.  Design, setting, and participants:   A prospective study, enrolling 40 patients with PCa undergoing RARP at our center, from May to October 2018.  Surgical procedure:   Patients underwent 3D AR RARP or, in case of unavailability of this technology, 2D cognitive RARP. In all patients, total anatomical reconstruction was used.  Measurements:   Clinical data were collected. In order to compare the two groups, nonparametric Mann-Whitney and chi-square tests were performed. A metallic clip was placed at the level of suspicious CI on the basis of images given by the 3D AR or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) report. The pathological analysis evaluated the presence of tumor at the level of the clip.  Results and limitations:   Twenty patients were enrolled in each group. Focusing on the 3D AR group at macroscopic evaluation, the metallic clip was placed at the tumor and capsular bulging in all cases. At microscopic assessment, cancer presence was confirmed in the suspicious area in 95.4% of the cases. Moreover, CI was correctly identified in 100.0% of the cases, thanks to the 3D image overlap. These results were compared with the 2D MRI cognitive group, showing, at microscopic analysis, statistically significant superiority of the 3D AR group in CI detection during the NS phase (100% vs 47.0%; p<0.05). The main limitation of this technique is that the segmentation and overlapping of the images are performed manually.  Conclusions:   Our findings suggest that, with the introduction of the elastic 3D virtual models, prostate deformation is correctly simulated during surgery and lesion location is correctly identified, even in dynamic reality with a subsequent potential reduction of positive surgical margin rate and, in the meantime, maximization of functional outcomes.

However, the feasibility of brachytherapy for renal transplant recipients (RTRs) is still uncertain.  Materials and methods:   Between August 2007 and March 2018, all patients who had undergone low-dose-rate (LDR) brachytherapy or high-dose-rate (HDR) brachytherapy for clinically localized CaP at our institution were retrospectively identified (n = 394). Of these patients, 3 had a history of renal transplantation. We reviewed all available clinical data retrospectively.  Results:   All of the RTRs received ABO-incompatible renal grafts from their spouses and had stable renal graft function before the diagnosis of CaP. The median age at diagnosis of CaP was 65 years (range, 60-67 years). The median time between transplantation and brachytherapy was 7 years (range, 4-10 years). In all of the patients, clinical stage was cT1cN0M0. Two patients received 125I LDR-brachytherapy (dose, 145 Gy) and 1 patient was treated by 192Ir HDR brachytherapy (dose, 19 Gy in 2 fractions) combined with external beam radiation therapy of 39 Gy in 13 fractions. The median follow-up period after brachytherapy was 44 months (range, 34-50 months). During the follow-up period, none of the patients developed disease progression including biochemical recurrence or clinically significant adverse events associated with radiation therapy.

Loss of the PTEN tumor suppressor gene is observed in 20% to 30% of prostate cancers (PCa) when first detected and the rate increases with PCa progression and advanced disease. Recent findings implicate a role for PTEN in cellular type I interferon response and immunosuppression in PCa. However, the way that PTEN inactivation alters antitumor immune response in PCa is poorly understood.  Materials and methods:   To investigate the changes associated with PTEN loss and an immunosuppressive TME in PCa, we used CIBERSORT to estimate the relative abundance of 22 immune-cell types from 741 primary and 96 metastatic tumors. Our in silico findings were then validated by immunohistochemical analysis of immune cells and IDO1 and PDL1 checkpoint proteins in a cohort of 94 radical prostatectomy specimens.  Results:   FoxP3+ T regulatory cells (Tregs) were significantly increased in PTEN-deficient PCa in all three public domain cohorts. Loss of PTEN in bone metastases was associated with lower CD8+ T-cell abundance, but in liver metastasis, FoxP3+ Tregs were present at higher levels. PTEN-deficient lymph node metastasis had a distinct profile, with high levels of CD8+ T cells. Moreover, we found that metastatic PCa presents higher abundance of FoxP3+ Treg when compared to primary lesions. Since PTEN-deficient tumors are likely to be immunosuppressed as a consequence of increased FoxP3+ Tregs, we then evaluated the localization and expression of IDO1, PDL1 immune checkpoints, and the corresponding density of FoxP3+ Treg and CD8+ T cells using our validation cohort (n = 94). We found that IDO1 protein expression and FoxP3+ Treg density were higher in neoplastic glands compared with benign adjacent tissue. Moreover, higher densities of FoxP3+ Treg cells in both stromal (P = 0.04) and tumor (P = 0.006) compartments were observed in PTEN-deficient tumors compared to tumors that retained PTEN activity. Similarly, IDO1 protein expression was significantly increased in the tumor glands of PTEN-deficient PCa (P < 0.0001). Spearman correlation analysis showed that IDO1 expression was significantly associated with FoxP3+ Treg and CD8+ T-cell density (P < 0.01).  Conclusions:   Our findings imply that PTEN deficiency is linked to an immunosuppressive state in PCa with distinct changes in the frequency of immune cell types in tumors from different metastatic sites. Our data suggest that determining PTEN status may also help guide the selection of patients for future immunotherapy trials in localized and metastatic PCa.""","""['Thiago Vidotto', 'Fabiano P Saggioro', 'Tamara Jamaspishvili', 'Deise L Chesca', 'Clarissa G Picanço de Albuquerque', 'Rodolfo B Reis', 'Charles H Graham', 'David M Berman', 'D Robert Siemens', 'Jeremy A Squire', 'Madhuri Koti']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['PD-L1 and IDO1 expression and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes in osteosarcoma patients: comparative study of primary and metastatic lesions.', 'CD4/CD8\xa0+\xa0T cells, DC subsets, Foxp3, and IDO expression are predictive indictors of gastric cancer prognosis.', 'A high CD8 to FOXP3 ratio in the tumor stroma and expression of PTEN in tumor cells are associated with improved\xa0survival in non-metastatic triple-negative breast carcinoma.', 'FoxP3+ T regulatory cells in cancer: Prognostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets.', 'Expression of costimulatory and inhibitory receptors in FoxP3+ regulatory T cells within the tumor microenvironment: Implications for combination immunotherapy approaches.', 'Synthetic lethal approaches to target cancers with loss of PTEN function.', 'Epigenetic modulation and prostate cancer: Paving the way for NK cell anti-tumor immunity.', 'Pan-cancer genomic analysis shows hemizygous PTEN loss tumors are associated with immune evasion and poor outcome.', 'Association of self-identified race and genetic ancestry with the immunogenomic landscape of primary prostate cancer.', 'A Novel Four Mitochondrial Respiration-Related Signature for Predicting Biochemical Recurrence of Prostate Cancer.']"""

There is a paucity of in vivo models reflecting specific aspects of BPH pathogenesis. Our aim was to investigate the nonobese diabetic (NOD) mouse as a potential model for subsequent intervention studies.  Materials and methods:   We used the NOD mouse, a model of autoimmune inflammation leading to type 1 diabetes to examine the effects of systemic inflammation and diabetes on the prostate. We assessed changes in prostatic histology, infiltrating leukocytes, and gene expression associated with aging and diabetic status.  Results:   Both stromal expansion and epithelial hyperplasia were observed in the prostates. Regardless of diabetic status, the degree of prostatic hyperplasia varied. Local inflammation was associated with a more severe prostatic phenotype in both diabetic and nondiabetic mice. Testicular atrophy was noted in diabetic mice, but prostate glands showed persistent focal cell proliferation. In addition, a prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN)-like phenotype was seen in several diabetic animals with an associated increase in c-Myc and MMP-2 expression. To examine changes in gene and cytokine expression we performed microarray and cytokine array analysis comparing the prostates of diabetic and nondiabetic animals. Microarray analysis revealed several differentially expressed genes including CCL3, CCL12, and TNFS10. Cytokine array analysis revealed increased expression of cytokines and proteases such as LDLR, IL28 A/B, and MMP-2 in diabetic mice.  Conclusion:   Overall, NOD mice provide a model to examine the effects of hyperglycemia and chronic inflammation on the prostate, demonstrating relevance to some of the mechanisms present underlying BPH and potentially the initiation of prostate cancer.""","""['LaTayia M Aaron-Brooks', 'Takeshi Sasaki', 'Renee E Vickman', 'Lin Wei', 'Omar E Franco', 'Yuan Ji', 'Susan E Crawford', 'Simon W Hayward']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Proliferation of Prostate Stromal Cell Induced by Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia Epithelial Cell Stimulated With Trichomonas vaginalis via Crosstalk With Mast Cell.', 'Malignant lesions in the ventral prostate of alloxan-induced diabetic rats.', 'Focal degeneration of basal cells and the resultant auto-immunoreactions: a novel mechanism for prostate tumor progression and invasion.', 'Could inflammation be a key component in the progression of benign prostatic hyperplasia?', 'Is benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) an immune inflammatory disease?', 'Comparison of the predictive value of anthropometric indicators for the risk of benign prostatic hyperplasia in southern China.', 'TNF is a potential therapeutic target to suppress prostatic inflammation and hyperplasia in autoimmune disease.', 'Construction of Potential Gene Expression and Regulation Networks in Prostate Cancer Using Bioinformatics Tools.', 'Is COVID-19 a risk factor for progression of benign prostatic hyperplasia and exacerbation of its related symptoms?: a systematic review.', 'Increased Expressions of Matrix Metalloproteinases (MMPs) in Prostate Cancer Tissues of Men with Type 2 Diabetes.']"""

A compilation of recommendations from radiation oncologists who were in Puerto Rico during the disaster, and from a panel of American Society for Radiation Oncology (ASTRO) cancer experts was created.  Methods and materials:   Radiation oncologists throughout Puerto Rico collaborated and improvised to continue treating patients in the immediate aftermath of the storm and as routine clinical operations were restored gradually. Empirical lessons from the experience of radiation therapy administration in this profoundly altered context of limited resources, impaired communication, and inadequate transportation were organized into a recommended template, applicable to any radiation oncology practice. ASTRO disease-site experts provided evidence-guidelines for mitigating the impact of a 2- to 3-week interruption in radiation therapy.  Results:   Practical measures to mitigate the medical impact of a disaster are summarized within the framework of ""Prepare, Communicate, Operate, Compensate."" Specific measures include the development of an emergency operations plan tailored to specific circumstances, prospective coordination with other radiation oncology clinics before a disaster, ongoing communications with emergency management organizations, and routine practice of alternate methods to disseminate information among providers and patients.  Conclusions:   These recommendations serve as a starting point to assist any radiation oncology practice in becoming more resiliently prepared for a local or regional disruption from any cause.

In the present study, we established multiple castration-resistant xenograft models from JDCaP mice to investigate the biological features of CRPC.  Methods:   Tissue from JDCaP mice was transplanted into male and female nude mice, and after serial passaging, castration-resistant sublines (JDCaP-CR2M and JDCaP-CR4M in male mice, JDCaP-CR2F and JDCaP-CR4F in female mice) were established.

Results:   All JDCaP-CR sublines showed continuous growth following the administration of bicalutamide, although the effects of testosterone varied among sublines. Parental JDCaP and JDCaP-CR2M, JDCaP-CR4M, and JDCaP-CR4F sublines expressed AR-v7, whereas JDCaP-CR2F exhibited elevated AR-v567es expression resulting from genomic deletion, which was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Moreover, we confirmed AR-v7 expression in the tumor of the original patient after androgen-deprivation therapy.  Conclusions:   Each JDCaP-CR subline showed different AR-v-expression patterns, with JDCaP-CR2F expressing AR-v567es due to genomic deletion.

This study aimed to describe how real-world clinical practice was changed with the public funding of novel hormonal agents (abiraterone and enzalutamide) in Quebec.  Methods:   We conducted a retrospective cohort study in two McGill University hospitals. Hospital-based cancer registries were used to select mCRPC patients in medical oncology departments from January 2010 to June 2014. Two groups according to mCRPC diagnosis year were built, with 2012 chosen as the cut-off year, corresponding to the year abiraterone was approved for public reimbursement in second-line in Quebec. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to estimate time to first docetaxel prescription since mCRPC diagnosis before and after 2012. Cox regression was used to identify predictive factors of docetaxel and novel hormonal agent use.  Results:   In our cohort, 308 patients diagnosed with mCRPC were selected with 162 patients in the pre-2012 group and 146 patients in the post-2012 group. The median age at mCRPC was 74.0 years old. At 12 months from diagnosis, 69% of patients received a prescription for docetaxel in the pre-2012 group comparatively to 53% in the post-2012 group. Factors that decreased the likelihood of docetaxel utilization were: age older than 80 at mCRPC diagnosis (HR: 0.5; 95%CI: 0.3-0.7), mCRPC diagnosis after 2012 (HR: 0.6; 95%CI: 0.4-0.8), and asymptomatic disease at mCRPC diagnosis (HR: 0.5; 95%CI: 0.3-0.7).

Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been suggested to involve in multiple biological process under physiological and pathological conditions, including osteogenic differentiation. In the present study, we performed comprehensive lncRNA profiling by lncRNA microarray analysis and identified prostate cancer-associated ncRNA transcript-1 (lncPCAT1) was gradually increased in PDLSCs during consecutive osteogenic induction, and it could further positively regulate the osteogenic differentiation both in vitro and in vivo, whereas lncPCAT1 inhibition led to suppressed osteogenic differentiation. Thereafter, we inferred a predicted interaction between lncPCAT1 and miR-106a-5p and then confirmed the direct binding sites of miR-106a-5p on lncPCAT1. Although miR-106a-5p upregulation led to decreased osteogenic differentiation, lncPCAT1 overexpression could reverse its suppression, indicating that lncPCAT1 act as a competing endogenous RNA for miR-106a-5p. Moreover, lncPCAT1 could sponge miR-106a-5p to upregulate miR-106a-5p-targeted gene BMP2, which was a crucial gene involved in osteogenic differentiation. Interestingly, we found that E2F5, another target of miR-106a-5p, could bind to the promoter of lncPCAT1 and then form a feed-forward regulatory network targeting BMP2.

It was found out that protein encoded by LASS2/TMSG1 could interact with the c subunit of vacuolar-ATPase (ATP6V0C). In this study, we explored the effect of LASS2/TMSG1 and its mutants on proliferation, migration and invasion of human prostate cancer cells and its molecular mechanism.  Methods:   We constructed four LASS2/TMSG1 mutants and stably transfected the variants to human prostate cancer cell line PC-3M-1E8 cell with high metastatic potential. The stable transfectants were identified by qPCR and Western blot through analyzing the expression of LASS2/TMSG1 and ATP6V0C, the cell biology functions of LASS2/TMSG1 and its four mutants were studied using growth curve,MTT assay, soft agar colony formation assay, wound migration assay, Matrigel invasion study and flow cytometry. Furthermore, immunofluorescence was used to analysis the interaction of LASS2/ TMSG1 mutants and ATP6V0C.  Results:   LASS2/TMSG1 mRNA and protein in LASS2/TMSG1 group and Mut1-Mut4 groups were higher than that in Vector group; Western blot showed that ATP6V0C protein in LASS2/TMSG1 wild group was lower than that in Vector group, but ATP6V0C protein in LASS2/TMSG1 S248A group was obviously higher than that in Vector group. MTT test and growth curve assay showed growth ability in LASS2/TMSG1 S248A group was increasing compared with other groups from day 5. Soft Agar colony formation experiment showed anchor independent growth ability in LASS2/TMSG1 S248A group was higher than those in the other groups (P<0.05), Cell migrations (from 35.3%±3.2% to 70.3%±3%) in LASS2/TMSG1 S248A group was increasing compared with LASS2/TMSG1 wild group (P<0.01), and more cells passed through Matrigel in LASS2/TMSG1 S248A group compared with LASS2/TMSG1 wild group (from 50±3.2 to 203±6.5, P<0.01), the apoptosis rate in LASS2/TMSG1 S248A group was obviously higher than that in LASS2/TMSG1 wild group (from 7% to 15.1%, P<0.05), and the G0/G1 ratio in LASS2/TMSG1 S248A group was obviously higher than that in LASS2/TMSG1 wild group (from 51.0% to 85.4%).

Methods:   This is a retrospective cohort study evaluating 635 men managed with active surveillance from 2005 to 2015 at a large, academic medical center. The primary endpoints of analyses are disease reclassification (i.e., change in volume or grade of cancer on subsequent biopsies after diagnosis), progression to definitive therapy with curative intent (i.e., surgery or radiotherapy), and surveillance failure-defined as the development of either biochemical failure after definitive therapy, metastases, or prostate cancer-specific mortality-among statin and non-statin users. Secondary analyses were performed to assess the effect of statin use on outcomes among men who progressed to definitive treatment.  Results:   Three hundred fifty-six (56.1%) patients in the cohort were on statin therapy at the initiation of surveillance. The median age was 66.7 and 63.3 years among statin and non-statin users, respectively. On univariate analysis, there were no differences in the rates of disease reclassification, progression to definitive treatment, and surveillance failure between the statin and non-statin users in the cohort (all p > 0.05). There was no difference in the rate of biochemical failure among men who progressed to definitive therapy when stratified by statin use (p = 0.89). Pathologic data were available for 105 men who progressed to radical prostatectomy while on surveillance at our institution. Duration of statin use (months) was inversely correlated with adverse pathology for radical prostatectomy on both univariate (OR: 0.99; 95% CI 0.98, 0.99; p = 0.03) and multivariate analysis (OR: 0.98; 95% CI 0.97, 0.99; p = 0.02).  Conclusion:   Statin use was not associated with any clinical benefit with regard to disease reclassification, progression to definitive treatment, or surveillance failure among men selecting active surveillance at our institution. There was a 2% decrease in the odds of adverse pathology for each month of statin use among the men who progressed to radical prostatectomy while on active surveillance, but it is unclear at this time if this association has any durable impact on surveillance outcomes among men with favorable risk prostate cancer.""","""['Yaw A Nyame', 'Lamont Wilkins', 'Daniel J Greene', 'Vishnu Ganesan', 'Charles Dai', 'Nima Almassi', 'Andrew J Stephenson', 'Michael Gong', 'Ryan Berglund', 'Eric A Klein']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Prostate Cancer Prostatic Dis""","""['The Long-Term Risks of Metastases in Men on Active Surveillance for Early Stage Prostate Cancer.', 'Impact of Biopsy Compliance on Outcomes for Patients on Active Surveillance for Prostate Cancer.', 'The Clinical Significance of Multiple Negative Surveillance Prostate Biopsies for Men on Active Surveillance-Does Cancer Vanish or Simply Hide?', 'Low-risk Prostate Cancer: Identification, Management, and Outcomes.', 'Management of localised prostate cancer: watchful waiting, surgery or radiation therapy, depending on the natural course, which is often relatively slow.', 'Evidence on Statins, Omega-3, and Prostate Cancer: A Narrative Review.']"""

Herein, we demonstrate that BET bromodomain inhibition blocks growth of a diverse set of CRPC cell models, including those that are AR-independent or in which c-Myc is not suppressed. To identify transcriptional regulators whose suppression accounts for these effects, we treated multiple CRPC cell lines with the BET bromodomain inhibitor JQ1 and then performed RNA-sequencing followed by Master Regulator computational analysis.

We hypothesize that overexpression of DNA repair genes may also drive poorer outcomes in prostate cancer. The ribonucleotide reductase small subunit M2 (RRM2) is essential for DNA synthesis and DNA repair by producing dNTPs. It is frequently overexpressed in cancers, but very little is known about its function in prostate cancer.  Experimental design:   The oncogenic activity of RRM2 in prostate cancer cells was assessed by inhibiting or overexpressing RRM2. The molecular mechanisms of RRM2 function were determined. The clinical significance of RRM2 overexpression was evaluated in 11 prostate cancer clinical cohorts. The efficacy of an RRM2 inhibitor (COH29) was assessed in vitro and in vivo. Finally, the mechanism underlying the transcriptional activation of RRM2 in prostate cancer tissue and cells was determined.  Results:   Knockdown of RRM2 inhibited its oncogenic function, whereas overexpression of RRM2 promoted epithelial mesenchymal transition in prostate cancer cells. The prognostic value of RRM2 RNA levels in prostate cancer was confirmed in 11 clinical cohorts. Integrating the transcriptomic and phosphoproteomic changes induced by RRM2 unraveled multiple oncogenic pathways downstream of RRM2. Targeting RRM2 with COH29 showed excellent efficacy. Thirteen putative RRM2-targeting transcription factors were bioinformatically identified, and FOXM1 was validated to transcriptionally activate RRM2 in prostate cancer.  Conclusions:   We propose that increased expression of RRM2 is a mechanism driving poor patient outcomes in prostate cancer and that its inhibition may be of significant therapeutic value.""","""['Ying Z Mazzu', 'Joshua Armenia', 'Goutam Chakraborty', 'Yuki Yoshikawa', ""Si'Ana A Coggins"", 'Subhiksha Nandakumar', 'Travis A Gerke', 'Mark M Pomerantz', 'Xintao Qiu', 'Huiyong Zhao', 'Mohammad Atiq', 'Nabeela Khan', 'Kazumasa Komura', 'Gwo-Shu Mary Lee', 'Samson W Fine', 'Connor Bell', ""Edward O'Connor"", 'Henry W Long', 'Matthew L Freedman', 'Baek Kim', 'Philip W Kantoff']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Clin Cancer Res""","""['Ribonucleotide reductase small subunit M2 is a master driver of aggressive prostate cancer.', 'DSCAM-AS1 promotes tumor growth of breast cancer by reducing miR-204-5p and up-regulating RRM2.', 'A MYBL2 complex for RRM2 transactivation and the synthetic effect of MYBL2 knockdown with WEE1 inhibition against colorectal cancer.', 'Inhibiting RRM2 to enhance the anticancer activity of chemotherapy.', 'Cancer Fighting SiRNA-RRM2 Loaded Nanorobots.', 'Computed tomography radiomics signature via machine learning predicts RRM2 and overall survival in hepatocellular carcinoma.', 'Diosmetin suppresses the progression of ESCC by CDK2/Rb/E2F2/RRM2 pathway and synergies with cisplatin.', 'C11orf54 promotes DNA repair via blocking CMA-mediated degradation of HIF1A.', 'Non-thermal plasma-treated melatonin inhibits the biological activity of HCC cells by increasing intracellular ROS levels and reducing RRM2 expression.', 'RRM2 as a novel prognostic and therapeutic target of NF1-associated MPNST.']"""

There is an urgent need to develop novel therapeutic agents to overcome chemoresistance and improve the overall survival of patients. We have designed a novel microtubule destabilizer (2-(4-hydroxy-1H-indol-3-yl)-1H-imidazol-4-yl)(3,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl)methanone (QW-296) and combined it with a newly synthesized hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway inhibitor 2-chloro-N 1-[4-chloro-3-(2-pyridinyl)phenyl]-N 4,N 4- bis(2-pyridinylmethyl)-1,4-benzenedicarboxamide (MDB5) to treat taxane-resistant (TXR) prostate cancer. The combination of QW-296 and MDB5 exhibited stronger anticancer activity toward DU145-TXR and PC3-TXR cells and suppressed tumor colony formation when compared with single-drug treatment. Because these drugs are hydrophobic, we synthesized the mPEG-p(TMC-MBC) [methoxy-poly(ethylene glycol)-block-poly(trimethylene carbonate-co-2-methyl-2-benzoxycarbonyl-propylene carbonate)] copolymer, which could self-assemble into micelles with loading capacities of 8.13% ± 0.75% and 9.12% ± 0.69% for QW-296 and MDB5, respectively. Further, these micelles provided controlled the respective drug release of 58% and 42% release of QW-296 and MDB5 within 24 hours when dialyzed against PBS (pH 7.4). We established an orthotopic prostate tumor in nude mice using stably luciferase expressing PC3-TXR cells. There was maximum tumor growth inhibition in the group treated with the combination therapy of QW-296 and MDB5 in micelles compared with their monotherapies or combination therapy formulated in cosolvent. The overall findings suggest that combination therapy with QW-296 and MDB5 has great clinical potential to treat TXR prostate cancer, and copolymer mPEG-p(TMC-MBC) could serve as an effective delivery vehicle to boost therapeutic efficacy in vivo.""","""['Ruinan Yang', 'Hao Chen', 'Dawei Guo', 'Yuxiang Dong', 'Duane D Miller', 'Wei Li', 'Ram I Mahato']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""J Pharmacol Exp Ther""","""['The use of micelles to deliver potential hedgehog pathway inhibitor for the treatment of liver fibrosis.', 'Design, Synthesis and Biological Evaluation of novel Hedgehog Inhibitors for treating Pancreatic Cancer.', 'Micellar Delivery of miR-34a Modulator Rubone and Paclitaxel in Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Exploitation of the Androgen Receptor to Overcome Taxane Resistance in Advanced Prostate Cancer.', 'Taxane- and epothilone-based chemotherapy: from molecule cargo cytoskeletal logistics to management of castration-resistant prostate carcinoma.', 'Resveratrol inhibits TRAF6/PTCH/SMO signal and regulates prostate cancer progression.', 'Advances in the Current Understanding of the Mechanisms Governing the Acquisition of Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Design, Synthesis, and Biological Evaluation of Stable Colchicine-Binding Site Tubulin Inhibitors 6-Aryl-2-benzoyl-pyridines as Potential Anticancer Agents.', 'Nanoformulation design and therapeutic potential of a novel tubulin inhibitor in pancreatic cancer.', 'Identification of Potential Key Genes and Pathways in Enzalutamide-Resistant Prostate Cancer Cell Lines: A Bioinformatics Analysis with Data from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) Database.']"""

Materials and methods:   The core lower urinary tract symptom score (CLSS) and the International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire (ICIQ)-Short Form (SF) questionnaires were administered to 607 consecutive, treatment-naïve men receiving RARP before and after surgery. The time course of comprehensive LUTS and various types of urinary incontinence, including stress-, urgency-, and urinary incontinence with no obvious reason, were evaluated. Continence recovery rates were compared for the different types of incontinence using Cox hazard regression analysis.  Results:   After surgery, stress urinary incontinence (SUI) was reported most frequently (32% of cases) as the chief complaint with the most impact on daily life, as assessed by the CLSS questionnaire, followed by urgency urinary incontinence (UUI; 27% of cases). The rates of continence recovery differed among the different types of urinary incontinence, such as after urinating, when dressed, when asleep, when physically active or exercising, when coughing or sneezing, before reaching the toilet, and for no obvious reason.

Data on androgens are discordant. We studied the link between baseline sex steroid levels (total 17β -estradiol [17βE2], total testosterone [tT], calculated bioavailable 17βE2 [bio-17βE2], and apparent free testosterone concentration [AFTC]) and bone microarchitecture deterioration assessed prospectively in a 820 older men followed for 8 years. Bone microarchitecture was assessed by HR-pQCT at baseline, then after 4 and 8 years. At both the skeletal sites, the bone microarchitecture deterioration rate did not correlate with serum levels of tT and 17βE2. At the distal radius, cortical area (Ct.Ar) decreased more rapidly in the lowest versus the highest AFTC quartile. At the distal tibia, cortical thickness (Ct.Th) decreased and trabecular area (Tb.Ar) increased more rapidly in the highest versus the lowest AFTC quartile. At the tibia, bone mineral content (BMC), total volumetric bone mineral density (Tt.vBMD), Ct.Th, and Ct.Ar decreased, whereas Tb.Ar increased faster in the lowest versus the highest bio-17βE2 quartile. In men who had both AFTC and bio-17βE2 in the lowest quartile (high-risk group), distal radius cortical vBMD (Ct.vBMD) decreased more rapidly compared with men who had both hormones in the three upper quartiles (reference group). At the distal tibia, Tt.vBMD, Ct.Th, Ct.Ar, and Ct.vBMD decreased, whereas Tb.Ar increased more rapidly in the high-risk group versus the reference group. In men receiving androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) for prostate cancer, BMC, Tt.vBMD, Ct.Th, Ct.Ar, and Ct.vBMD decreased, whereas Tb.Ar increased more rapidly than in men not receiving ADT at both the skeletal sites. Thus, in older men followed up prospectively, low levels of bio-17βE2, and to a smaller extent AFTC, are associated with accelerated cortical bone deterioration.

Screening recommendations have changed substantially over the last 25 years. Since 2011 (United States) and 2014 (Canada), taskforce guidelines have recommended against screening using the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test in low-risk men of all ages. This work reports on trends in prostate cancer incidence, mortality, and stage at diagnosis in Canada from 1992 to 2015.  Data and methods:   Prostate cancer incidence, mortality, and stage at diagnosis were retrieved from Statistics Canada's Canadian Cancer Registry and Canadian Vital Statistics - Death Database. Joinpoint analysis was used to examine trends over time.  Results:   The age-standardized incidence rate (ASIR) of prostate cancer peaked in 1993 and 2001, and declined thereafter. From 2011 to 2015, the ASIR declined by 9.3% per year. The age-standardized mortality rate (ASMR) decreased continuously from 1992 to 2015, but fell most rapidly (2.9% per year) after 2001. Data from two provinces show that, from 2005 to 2015, the rate of Stage I and Stage II cancers decreased by 3.2% per year, while the rate of Stage III and Stage IV cancers remained relatively stable.  Discussion:   Incidence of prostate cancer has declined substantially in recent years. Most of the decline seems to be in localized cases (Stage I and Stage II). Changes in incidence have mirrored changes to PSA screening recommendations.

In this study, we consider the improvement of incorporating texture features (TFs) from T2-weighted (T2w) multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) relative to mpMRI alone to predict HG and LG disease. Material and methods: In vivo mpMRI was acquired from 30 patients prior to radical prostatectomy. Sequences included T2w imaging, DWI and dynamic contrast enhanced (DCE) MRI. In vivo mpMRI data were co-registered with 'ground truth' histology. Tumours were delineated on the histology with Gleason scores (GSs) and classed as HG if GS ≥ 4 + 3, or LG if GS ≤ 3 + 4. Texture features based on three statistical families, namely the grey-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM), grey-level run length matrix (GLRLM) and the grey-level size zone matrix (GLSZM), were computed from T2w images. Logistic regression models were trained using different feature subsets to classify each lesion as either HG or LG. To avoid overfitting, fivefold cross validation was applied on feature selection, model training and performance evaluation. Performance of all models generated was evaluated using the area under the curve (AUC) method. Results: Consistent with previous studies, ADC was found to discriminate between HG and LG with an AUC of 0.76. Of the three statistical TF families, GLCM (plus select mpMRI features including ADC) scored the highest AUC (0.84) with GLRLM plus mpMRI similarly performing well (AUC = 0.82). When all TFs were considered in combination, an AUC of 0.91 (95% confidence interval 0.87-0.95) was achieved. Conclusions: Incorporating T2w TFs significantly improved model performance for classifying prostate tumour aggressiveness.

However, the mechanism of Jagged1's involvement in platinum-resistant ovarian cancer has not been thoroughly elucidated to date. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the roles of Jagged1 in the platinum resistance of ovarian cancer and its possible mechanisms. Compared with a platinum responsive group of ovarian epithelial cell carcinomas, we found the positive staining intensity of Notch1, Notch2, Jagged1, STAT3 and Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) proteins were lower in a platinum-resistant group. The DDP-resistant ovarian cancer cell line (C13K) had a higher IC50 of DDP than its parental cell line (OV2008) (P < 0.05) and acquired an EMT phenotype and invasive characteristics. Inhibiting or knockdown of Jagged1 expression could not only reduce its capacity of migration and invasion but also reverse EMT and down-regulate the expression of serine 727-phosphorylated STAT3 (pS727) at the protein level but not total STAT3 or tyrosine 705-phosphorylated STAT3 (pY705) in C13K cells. Furthermore, it was found that crosstalk between the Jagged1/Notch and JAK/STAT3 signalling pathways were involved in Jagged1-promoting EMT in C13K cells. Experiments in vivo showed a reduced micrometastatic tumour burden in the lung, liver and spleen of mice implanted with C13K cells with knocked-down Jagged1 compared with mice implanted with control cells. All of these results demonstrate that Jagged1 can crosstalk with the JAK/STAT3 pathway, and they all cooperate to promote the aberrant occurrence of EMT, further reinforcing the abilities of invasion and migration of platinum-resistant ovarian cancer in vivo and in vitro.""","""['Jiang Yang', 'Hui Xing', 'Danhua Lu', 'Jun Wang', 'Bingshu Li', 'Jianming Tang', 'Fengqin Gu', 'Li Hong']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""J Cell Mol Med""","""['NANOG regulates epithelial-mesenchymal transition and chemoresistance through activation of the STAT3 pathway in epithelial ovarian cancer.', 'MicroRNA-302 represses epithelial-mesenchymal transition and cisplatin resistance by regulating ATAD2 in ovarian carcinoma.', 'SMAD3 inducing the transcription of \u2009STYK1 to promote the EMT process and improve the tolerance of ovarian carcinoma cells to paclitaxel.', 'Ovarian Cancer-Insights into Platinum Resistance and Overcoming It.', 'New approaches for targeting platinum-resistant ovarian cancer.', 'APEX1 predicts poor prognosis of gallbladder cancer and affects biological properties of CD133+ GBC-SD cells via upregulating Jagged1.', 'Mesenchymal stem cells in the treatment of spinal cord injury: Mechanisms, current advances and future challenges.', 'Immunotargeting of Cancer Stem Cells.', 'Exploring prognostic indicators in the pathological images of ovarian cancer based on a deep survival network.', 'Notch signaling in female cancers: a multifaceted node to overcome drug resistance.']"""

Log-rank test and multivariate Cox regression analysis adjusted for covariates were used to evaluate associations with the risk of biochemical recurrence (BCR) after RP. In the discovery set, four SNPs in CDH2 were marginally associated with BCR. Among these, CDH2 rs643555C > T was found to be associated with BCR in the replication set. Patients with rs643555TT genotype had a significantly shorter BCR-free survival compared with those with CC/CT genotypes in the combined analysis (adjusted hazard ratio 1.78, 95% confidence interval 1.19-2.67, P = 0.005). Additional analyses revealed that rs643555T was associated with higher expression of CDH2, and upregulated CDH2 was correlated with tumor aggressiveness and shortened BCR-free survival.

However, IDC-P rarely occurs as an isolated finding at radical prostatectomy or with concurrent low-grade (Grade Group 1) invasive carcinoma. We hypothesized that isolated IDC-P (iIDC-P) in these unusual cases may represent a distinct in situ lesion and molecularly profiled 15 cases. iIDC-P was characterized by copy number alteration (CNA) profiling and targeted next generation sequencing in cases with sufficient tissue (n = 7). Immunohistochemistry for PTEN and ERG was performed on the total cohort (n = 15), where areas of iIDC-P and associated invasive disease were evaluated separately (n = 9). By copy number profiling, iIDC-P alterations were similar to those previously described in high-grade invasive PCa (PTEN, RB1, and CHD1 loss; MYC gain). However, in four cases, targeted sequencing revealed a striking number of activating oncogenic driver mutations in MAPK and PI3K pathway genes, which are extraordinarily rare in conventional PCa. In addition, pathogenic mutations in DNA repair genes were found in two cases of iIDC-P (BRCA2, CHEK2, CDK12) and other known PCa-associated mutations (FOXA1, SPOP) in two cases. Overall, ERG was expressed in 7% (1/15) of the iIDC-P lesions and PTEN was lost in 53% (8/15). Discordance for ERG or PTEN status between IDC-P and the low-grade PCa was observed in five of nine cases, with intact PTEN in the invasive tumor and PTEN loss in IDC-P in four. Despite a CNA profile similar to conventional PCa, iIDC-P is enriched with potentially targetable oncogenic driver mutations in MAPK/PI3K genes. Based on PTEN and ERG status, iIDC-P is not likely a precursor to the associated low-grade invasive PCa, but represents a molecularly unique in situ tumor of unclear clinical significance. © 2019 Pathological Society of Great Britain and Ireland.

Midkine (MK) is overexpressed in PCa, as well as in tumor-initiating cells termed cancer stem cells (CSCs). Apigenin is a dietary flavone with considerable anti-tumor activities. In this study, we explored the possible therapeutic use of MK silencing, apigenin treatment, and a combination of both on human PCa and prostate cancer stem cells (PCSCs). CD44+CD133+ PC3 and CD44+ LNCaP CSCs were isolated from their parent cell lines. Both MK knockdown and apigenin treatment resulted in loss of cell viability in PCSCs, and these effects were significantly elevated when apigenin was applied with MK silencing. Combined treatment of CD44+CD133+ PC3 cells with apigenin and MK siRNA was also more effective in inducing apoptotic and non-apoptotic cell death when compared with individual applications. Treatment of CD44+ LNCaP cells with apigenin significantly decreased viability, although the combination treatment did not markedly alter the individual therapy. Molecular events underlying cell cycle arrest and inhibition of the survival, proliferation, and migration of CD44+CD133+ PC3 cells were found to be associated with upregulated p21, p27, Bax, Bid, caspase-3, and caspase-8 expression, as well as downregulated p-p38, p-ERK, NF-κB, and PARP. In addition, the combination of apigenin treatment and MK silencing showed better outcomes on the anticancer efficacy of docetaxel in CD44+CD133+ PC3 cells.

For example, PET imaging with the low photon statistics is closely related to active efforts to significantly reduce radiation exposure from radiopharmaceuticals. We investigated two examples of low-count PET imaging: (a) imaging [90Y]microsphere radioembolization that suffers the very small positron emission fraction of Y-90's decay processes, and (b) cancer imaging with [68Ga]citrate with uptake time of 3-4 half-lives, necessary for visualizing tumors. In particular, we investigated a type of penalized likelihood reconstruction algorithm, block sequential regularized expectation maximization (BSREM), for improving both image quality and quantitative accuracy of these low-count PET imaging cases.  Procedures:   The NEMA/IEC Body phantom filled with aqueous solution of Y-90 or Ga-68 was scanned to mimic the low-count scenarios of corresponding patient data acquisitions on a time-of-flight (TOF) PET/magnetic resonance imaging system. Contrast recovery, background variation, and signal-to-noise ratio were evaluated in different sets of count densities using both conventional TOF ordered subset expectation (TOF-OSEM) and TOF-BSREM algorithms. The regularization parameter, beta, in BSREM that controls the tradeoff between image noise and resolution was evaluated to find a value for improved confidence in image interpretation. Visual quality assessment of the images obtained from patients administered with [68Ga]citrate (n = 6) was performed. We also made preliminary visual image quality assessment for one patient with [90Y]microspheres. In Y-90 imaging, the effect of 511-keV energy window selection for minimizing the number of random events was also evaluated.  Results:   Quantitatively, phantom images reconstructed with TOF-BSREM showed improved contrast recovery, background variation, and signal-to-noise ratio values over images reconstructed with TOF-OSEM. Both phantom and patient studies of delayed imaging of [68Ga]citrate show that TOF-BSREM with beta = 500 gives the best tradeoff between image noise and image resolution based on visual assessment by the readers. The NEMA-IQ phantom study with [90Y]microspheres shows that the narrow energy window (460-562 keV) recovers activity concentrations in small spheres better than the regular energy window (425-650 keV) with the beta value of 2000 using the TOF-BSREM algorithm.

In this study, six commercial anti-PTEN mAb have been validated and characterized for sensitivity and specificity by IHC and FISH, using a set of prostate and urothelial bladder tumor specimens, and by immunoblot, using PTEN positive and PTEN negative human cell lines. Immunoblot precise epitope mapping, performed using recombinant PTEN variants and mutations, revealed that all mAb recognized linear epitopes of 6-11 amino acid length at the PTEN C-terminus. Tumor-associated or disease-associated mutations at the PTEN C-terminus did not affect subcellular localization or PIP3 phosphatase activity of PTEN in cells, although resulted in specific loss of reactivity for some mAb. Furthermore, specific mimicking-phosphorylation mutations at the PTEN C-terminal region also abolished binding of specific mAb.

The exploration of how MPSSS affects the functions of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) will provide a new perspective for understanding the antitumor effects of MPSSS. In the present study, prostate CAFs were selected as target cells to study whether MPSSS affected cell proliferation and function. The results showed that MPSSS did not directly inhibit the growth of prostate CAFs but interfered with CAF-mediated T cell inhibition and affected the immunosuppressive function of prostate CAFs. Mechanistic studies were further performed and showed that MPSSS activated key node proteins in the NF-κB pathway that were dependent on MyD88, and a TLR4 inhibitor blocked the changes in these proteins and the effect of MPSSS. We hypothesize that MPSSS can activate the MyD88-dependent TLR4-NF-κB signaling pathway to change the function of CAFs. In conclusion, these results demonstrate that MPSSS can not only effectively inhibit the growth of prostate cancer as we previously reported but also alter the function of prostate CAFs by activating the TLR4-NF-κB pathway, providing a new strategy for the comprehensive treatment of tumors.""","""['Yuwei Xu', 'Jing Ma', 'Qilin Zheng', 'Yuanyuan Wang', 'Minghua Hu', 'Fangli Ma', 'Zhihai Qin', 'Ningjing Lei', 'Ning Tao']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Biosci Rep""","""['Proteomics reveals the function reverse of MPSSS-treated prostate cancer-associated fibroblasts to suppress PC-3 cell viability via the FoxO pathway.', 'Polysaccharide from Lentinus edodes inhibits the immunosuppressive function of myeloid-derived suppressor cells.', 'A polysaccharide from Dictyophora indusiata inhibits the immunosuppressive function of cancer-associated fibroblasts.', 'Emerging Nano Drug Delivery Systems Targeting Cancer-Associated Fibroblasts for Improved Antitumor Effect and Tumor Drug Penetration.', 'The Dark Side of Fibroblasts: Cancer-Associated Fibroblasts as Mediators of Immunosuppression in the Tumor Microenvironment.', 'The Effect of Novel Selenopolysaccharide Isolated from Lentinula edodes Mycelium on Human T Lymphocytes Activation, Proliferation, and Cytokines Synthesis.', 'Ligustilide Inhibits Tumor Angiogenesis by Downregulating VEGFA Secretion from Cancer-Associated Fibroblasts in Prostate Cancer via TLR4.', 'Identification of Cancer-Associated Fibroblast Subtype of Triple-Negative Breast Cancer.', 'Proteomic Research on the Antitumor Properties of Medicinal Mushrooms.', 'Signaling pathways in cancer-associated fibroblasts and targeted therapy for cancer.']"""

In many of these tumors, the cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) pathway is activated. Previous studies have shown that PKA can synergize with low levels of androgen to enhance androgen signaling and consequent cell proliferation, leading to castration-resistant prostate cancer. However, the mechanism by which PKA causes AR stimulation in the presence of low/no androgen is not established yet. Here, using immunofluorescence immunoblotting assays, co-immunoprecipitation, siRNA-mediated gene silencing, and reporter gene assays, we demonstrate that PKA activation is necessary for the phosphorylation of heat shock protein (HSP90) that binds to unliganded AR in the cytoplasm, restricting its entry into the nucleus. We also found that PKA-mediated phosphorylation of the Thr89 residue in HSP90 releases AR from HSP90, enabling AR binding to HSP27 and its migration into the nucleus. Substitution of the Thr89 in HSP90 prevented its phosphorylation by PKA and significantly reduced AR transactivation and cellular proliferation. We further observed that the transcription of AR target genes, such as prostate-specific antigen (PSA), is also lowered in the HSP90 Thr89 variant. These results suggest that using a small-molecule inhibitor against the HSP90 Thr89 residue in conjunction with existing androgen-ablative therapy may be more effective than androgen-ablative therapy alone in the treatment of prostate cancer patients.""","""['Manisha Dagar', 'Julie Pratibha Singh', 'Gunjan Dagar', 'Rakesh K Tyagi', 'Gargi Bagchi']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""J Biol Chem""","""['Keys to unlock androgen receptor translocation.', 'Capillarisin blocks prostate-specific antigen expression on activation of androgen receptor in prostate carcinoma cells.', 'Downregulation of androgen receptors by NaAsO2 via inhibition of AKT-NF-κB and HSP90 in castration resistant prostate cancer.', 'The role of protein kinase A pathway and cAMP responsive element-binding protein in androgen receptor-mediated transcription at the prostate-specific antigen locus.', 'Androgen receptors in hormone-dependent and castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Targeting the androgen receptor pathway in prostate cancer.', 'Mutations F352A and Y528A in human HSP90α reduce fibronectin association and fibrillogenesis in cell-derived matrices.', 'Multiomics approach to profiling Sertoli cell maturation during development of the spermatogonial stem cell niche.', 'The CAPRA&PDE4D5/7/9 Prognostic Model Is Significantly Associated with Adverse Post-Surgical Pathology Outcomes.', 'Interplay of Developmental Hippo-Notch Signaling Pathways with the DNA Damage Response in Prostate Cancer.', 'Targeting Protein Kinases and Epigenetic Control as Combinatorial Therapy Options for Advanced Prostate Cancer Treatment.']"""

Prior investigations have focused on monotherapy, but many clinical cancer treatments combine two or more drugs. Optimizing the evolutionary dynamics in multidrug therapy is challenging because of the complex cellular interactions and the large parameter space of potential variations in drugs, doses, and treatment schedules. However, multidrug therapy also represents an opportunity to further improve outcomes using evolution-based strategies.  Experimental design:   We examine evolution-based strategies for two-drug therapy and identify an approach that divides the treatment drugs into primary and secondary roles. The primary drug has the greatest efficacy and/or lowest toxicity. The secondary drug is applied solely to reduce the resistant population to the primary drug.  Results:   Simulations from the mathematical model demonstrate that the primary-secondary approach increases time to progression (TTP) compared with conventional strategies in which drugs are administered without regard to evolutionary dynamics. We apply our model to an ongoing adaptive therapy clinical trial of evolution-based administration of abiraterone to treat metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer. Model simulations, parameterized with data from individual patients who progressed, demonstrate that strategic application of docetaxel during abiraterone therapy would have significantly increased their TTP.  Conclusions:   Mathematical models can integrate evolutionary dynamics into multidrug cancer clinical trials. This has the potential to improve outcomes and to develop clinical trials in which these mathematical models are also used to estimate the mechanism(s) of treatment failure and explore alternative strategies to improve outcomes in future trials.""","""['Jeffrey B West', 'Mina N Dinh', 'Joel S Brown', 'Jingsong Zhang', 'Alexander R Anderson', 'Robert A Gatenby']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Clin Cancer Res""","""['An adaptive approach to therapy.', 'Evolution-based mathematical models significantly prolong response to abiraterone in metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer and identify strategies to further improve outcomes.', 'Olaparib combined with abiraterone in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer: a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 2 trial.', 'Real world evidence: Abiraterone use post-docetaxel in metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Systemic therapy in men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer: a systematic review.', 'Targeting Metastatic Hormone Sensitive Prostate Cancer: Chemohormonal Therapy and New Combinatorial Approaches.', 'Evolution-Informed Strategies for Combating Drug Resistance in Cancer.', 'A survey of open questions in adaptive therapy: Bridging mathematics and clinical translation.', 'Abiraterone-Docetaxel scheduling for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer based on evolutionary dynamics.', 'Patient-specific forecasting of postradiotherapy prostate-specific antigen kinetics enables early prediction of biochemical relapse.', 'A Phase 1b Adaptive Androgen Deprivation Therapy Trial in Metastatic Castration Sensitive Prostate Cancer.']"""

However, detection of the most prominent variant, AR-V7, on its own, is not sufficiently accurate for prediction of response. Thus, simultaneous detection of other variants might improve prediction. AR-V567es has been shown to be expressed in late stages of prostate cancer. Yet, there have been discrepant results regarding incidence of AR-V567es. We therefore aimed to perform a comprehensive comparison of different detection approaches for AR-V567es mRNA.  Experimental design:   We compared a custom-made, probe-based PCR assay with 6 published AR-V567es detection PCR assays in distinct samples, that is, cancer cell lines, LuCaP xenografts, primary and metastatic tumor samples, and circulating tumor cells (CTC).  Results:   Using distinct approaches, we concordantly detected expression of AR-V567es in only three of 45 samples (LuCaP xenografts 86.2 and 136s2 as well as one CTC sample). We observed varying results in all other samples. Specificity analysis displayed nonspecific binding of 5 previously published PCR assays to AR full-length mRNA in the absence of AR-V567es.  Conclusions:   Validation of biomarker detection approaches is one of the most critical steps before transfer into clinical application. By performing comparative analysis of different detection approaches, we revealed eminent variability among previously described systems. Furthermore, we demonstrate an overestimation of AR-V567es in prostate cancer, presumably due to nonspecific detection of AR-FL mRNA. Therefore, any correlation between AR-V567es expression and clinical responses is highly doubtful and does not reflect the biological nature of the disease.""","""['Christof Bernemann', 'Verena Humberg', 'Barbara Thielen', 'Julie Steinestel', 'Xin Chen', 'Stefan Duensing', 'Andres J Schrader', 'Martin Boegemann']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Clin Cancer Res""","""['Clinical Significance of AR-V567es in Prostate Cancer-Letter.', 'Clinical Significance of AR-V567es in Prostate Cancer-Response.', 'Expression of AR-V7 and ARv567es in Circulating Tumor Cells Correlates with Outcomes to Taxane Therapy in Men with Metastatic Prostate Cancer Treated in TAXYNERGY.', 'Upregulation of potential regulatory signaling molecules correlate with androgen receptor splice variants AR-V7 and AR-V567es in prostate cancer metastasis.', 'Differential expression of androgen receptor variants in hormone-sensitive prostate cancer xenografts, castration-resistant sublines, and patient specimens according to the treatment sequence.', 'CTC-derived AR-V7 detection as a prognostic and predictive biomarker in advanced prostate cancer.', 'ARV-7: A biomarker for the treatment of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Co-expression and clinical utility of AR-FL and AR splice variants AR-V3, AR-V7 and AR-V9 in prostate cancer.', 'AR Structural Variants and Prostate Cancer.', 'The Prognostic Value of Liquid Biopsies for Benefit of Salvage Radiotherapy in Relapsed Oligometastatic Prostate Cancer.', 'Comparison of circulating tumor cells and AR-V7 as clinical biomarker in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer patients.', 'Differential Expression of the Androgen Receptor, Splice Variants and Relaxin 2 in Renal Cancer.']"""

Few studies have investigated it in Gleason grade group (GG) 5 prostate cancer (PCa), known to have a high risk of nodal metastases.  Objective:   To assess the impact of WPRT on patients with GG 5 PCa treated with external-beam radiotherapy (EBRT) or EBRT with a brachytherapy boost (EBRT+BT).  Design, setting, and participants:   We identified 1170 patients with biopsy-proven GG 5 PCa from 11 centers in the United States and one in Norway treated between 2000 and 2013 (734 with EBRT and 436 with EBRT+BT).  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Biochemical recurrence-free survival (bRFS), distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS), and prostate cancer-specific survival (PCSS) were compared using Cox proportional hazards models with propensity score adjustment.  Results and limitations:   A total of 299 EBRT patients (41%) and 320 EBRT+BT patients (73%) received WPRT. The adjusted 5-yr bRFS rates with WPRT in the EBRT and EBRT+BT groups were 66% and 88%, respectively. Without WPRT, these rates for the EBRT and EBRT+BT groups were 58% and 78%, respectively. The median follow-up was 5.6yr. WPRT was associated with improved bRFS among patients treated with EBRT+BT (hazard ratio [HR] 0.5, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.2-0.9, p=0.02), but no evidence for improvement was found in those treated with EBRT (HR 0.8, 95% CI 0.6-1.2, p=0.4). WPRT was not significantly associated with improved DMFS or PCSS in the EBRT group (HR 1.1, 95% CI 0.7-1.7, p=0.8 for DMFS and HR 0.7, 95% CI 0.4-1.1, p=0.1 for PCSS), or in the EBRT+BT group (HR 0.6, 95% CI 0.3-1.4, p=0.2 for DMFS and HR 0.5 95% CI 0.2-1.2, p=0.1 for PCSS).  Conclusions:   WPRT was not associated with improved PCSS or DMFS in patients with GG 5 PCa who received either EBRT or EBRT+BT. However, WPRT was associated with a significant improvement in bRFS among patients receiving EBRT+BT. Strategies to optimize WPRT, potentially with the use of advanced imaging techniques to identify occult nodal disease, are warranted.  Patient summary:   When men with a high Gleason grade prostate cancer receive radiation with external radiation and brachytherapy, the addition of radiation to the pelvis results in a longer duration of prostate-specific antigen control. However, we did not find a difference in their survival from prostate cancer or in their survival without metastatic disease. We also did not find a benefit for radiation to the pelvis in men who received radiation without brachytherapy.""","""['Kiri A Sandler', 'Ryan R Cook', 'Jay P Ciezki', 'Ashley E Ross', 'Mark M Pomerantz', 'Paul L Nguyen', 'Talha Shaikh', 'Phuoc T Tran', 'Richard G Stock', 'Gregory S Merrick', 'David Jeffrey Demanes', 'Daniel E Spratt', 'Eyad I Abu-Isa', 'Trude B Wedde', 'Wolfgang Lilleby', 'Daniel J Krauss', 'Grace K Shaw', 'Ridwan Alam', 'Chandana A Reddy', 'Daniel Y Song', 'Eric A Klein', 'Andrew J Stephenson', 'Jeffrey J Tosoian', 'John V Hegde', 'Sun Mi Yoo', 'Ryan Fiano', ""Anthony V D'Amico"", 'Nicholas G Nickols', 'William J Aronson', 'Ahmad Sadeghi', 'Stephen C Greco', 'Curtiland Deville Jr', 'Todd McNutt', 'Theodore L DeWeese', 'Robert E Reiter', 'Jonathan W Said', 'Michael L Steinberg', 'Eric M Horwitz', 'Patrick A Kupelian', 'Christopher R King', 'Amar U Kishan']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Eur Urol""","""['Randomized Trials and the Goldilocks Problem.', 'Is pelvic prophylactic radiotherapy in prostate cancer just right?', 'Ten-year survival after High-Dose-Rate Brachytherapy combined with External Beam Radiation Therapy in high-risk prostate cancer: A comparison with the Norwegian SPCG-7 cohort.', 'Radical Prostatectomy, External Beam Radiotherapy, or External Beam Radiotherapy With Brachytherapy Boost and Disease Progression and Mortality in Patients With Gleason Score 9-10 Prostate Cancer.', 'External Beam Radiation Therapy (EBRT) and High-Dose-Rate (HDR) Brachytherapy for Intermediate and High-Risk Prostate Cancer: The Impact of EBRT Volume.', 'Local Failure Events in Prostate Cancer Treated with Radiotherapy: A Pooled Analysis of 18 Randomized Trials from the Meta-analysis of Randomized Trials in Cancer of the Prostate Consortium (LEVIATHAN).', 'Permanent interstitial low-dose-rate brachytherapy for patients with localised prostate cancer: a systematic review of randomised and nonrandomised controlled clinical trials.', 'Early results of PRO-EPI: PROspective multicenter observational study on elective pelvic nodes irradiation in patients with intermediate/high/very high-risk non-metastatic prostate cancer submitted to radical, adjuvant, or salvage radiotherapy with or without concomitant androgen deprivation therapy.', 'Overview of the current role of stereotactic body radiotherapy in the treatment of unfavorable intermediate- and high-risk prostate cancer.', 'Development of a Radiomic-Based Model Predicting Lymph Node Involvement in Prostate Cancer Patients.', 'SABR for High-Risk Prostate Cancer: A Prospective Multilevel MRI-Based Dose Escalation Trial.', 'Salvage therapy for prostate cancer after radical prostatectomy.']"""

The SmartBX™ system (UC-care, Israel) provides a prostate biopsy core preembedding method. The aim of this study was to compare cancer detection rates between the 3D TRUS-guidance and preembedding method with conventional 2D GS TRUS-guidance among patients undergoing prostate biopsies.  Methods:   We retrospectively analyzed the records of all patients who underwent prostate biopsies for PCa detection at our institution from 2007 to 2016. The cohort was divided into a 2D GS TRUS-guidance cohort (from 2007 to 2013, n = 1149) and a 3D GS TRUS-guidance with preembedding cohort (from 2013 to 2016, n = 469). Effect of 3D GS TRUS-guidance with preembedding on detection rate of PCa and clinically significant PCa (Gleason score ≥ 7 or > 2 biopsy cores with a Gleason score 6) was compared to 2D GS TRUS-guidance using regression models.  Results:   Detection rate of PCa and clinically significant PCa was 39.0 and 24.9% in the 3D GS TRUS cohort compared to 33.5 and 19.0% in the 2D GS TRUS cohort, respectively. On multivariate regression analysis the use of 3D GS TRUS-guidance with preembedding was associated with a significant increase in detection rate of PCa (aOR = 1.33; 95% CI: 1.03-1.72) and clinically significant PCa (aOR = 1.47; 95% CI: 1.09-1.98).

The aim of the present study is to investigate its effects on proliferation inhibition, apoptosis-inducing and cell-cycle arrest activity using a prostate cancer PC-3 cell line. The proliferation inhibition was evaluated by MTT assay, apoptosis was detected by Annexin V/propidium iodide (PI) staining and Hoechst 33258 staining, cell cycle distributions were measured by flow cytometry, and western blot analysis was used to determine specific cellular apoptotic protein expressions of Bcl-2, Bax, caspase-3 and cleaved-caspase-3. According to the results of this study, peperomin E exhibited significant anti-proliferation activity on PC-3 cell lines in vitro in a dose-dependent manner. Peperomin E treatments lead to marked morphological changes. Apoptotic cell count and cell-cycle distribution at G2/M phase significantly increased with increasing concentrations of peperomin E. The down-regulated expression level of Bcl-2 and up-regulated expression level of Bax and cleaved-caspase-3 compared with the controls were also observed after peperomin E treatment. These data suggest that peperomin E exhibited proliferation inhabitation, apoptosis-inducing and cell-cycle arrest activity on PC-3 cell lines.

Purpose:   To compare geometric distortion on prostate MRI between standard DWI and a geometric distortion correction method for DWI described as static distortion correction DWI (SDC DWI).  Study type:   Retrospective case study.  Population:   Thirty patients (ages 31-81 years) undergoing prostate MRI.  Sequence:   Geometric distortions from echo planar imaging were corrected with the SDC DWI protocol, which first acquires a B0 -field map to estimate geometric distortions.  Assessment:   Contours of the prostate were placed on axial T2 -weighted imaging (T2 WI) as an anatomic standard. Pixel shifts and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values were compared between prostate contours applied to the SDC DWI and standard DWI sequences. Detailed characterization of the impact of SDC DWI was performed in three representative patients.  Statistical tests:   One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) test, Spearman correlation test, and Bland-Altman plots were calculated.  Results:   There was significantly greater overlap of the SDC DWI prostate region of interest (ROI) with T2 WI than standard DWI with T2 WI (10.56 cm2 ± 3.14, P < 0.05). R2 of ADC values from standard DWI vs. SDC DWI in the 30 patients ranged from 0.02-0.94 (mean 0.60). A patient without susceptibility artifact demonstrated minimal pixel shift ranging from 0.6-1.3 mm and high correlation of ADC values (R2 = 0.89) between SDC DWI and standard DWI. A patient with rectal gas showed greater pixel shift (range: -2.5 to -0.5 mm) and less ADC value correlation (R2 = 0.69). A patient with a pelvic phlebolith adjacent to the prostate showed an even greater pixel shift (range: 10-16 mm) and decreased ADC correlation (R2 = 0.21).

This study aimed to conduct an economic evaluation of the impact of adopting this commercially-available test in the Hong Kong public health service to determine whether further research is justified. A cost-consequence analysis was undertaken comparing the current diagnostic pathway with a proposed diagnostic pathway using the Prostate Health Index. Data for the model was taken from a prospective cohort study recruited at a single-institution and micro-costing studies. Using a cut off PHI score of 35 to avoid biopsy would cost HK$3,000 and save HK$7,988 per patient in biopsy costs and HK$511 from a reduction in biopsy-related adverse events. The net cost impact of the change was estimated to be HK$5,500 under base case assumptions. At the base case sensitivity and specificity for all grades of cancer (61.3% and 77.5% respectively) all grade cancer could be missed in 4.22% of the population and high grade cancer in 0.53%. The introduction of the prostate health index into the diagnostic pathway for prostate cancer in Hong Kong has the potential to reduce biopsies, biopsy costs and biopsy-related adverse events.

Materials and methods: This study compared two cohorts in survival outcomes, matched on the year of diagnosis and age. In both groups there was a curative intention to treat localized high-risk prostate cancer (one or more of Gleason score 8-10, PSA 20-50 or stage T3), diagnosed between 1995-2010, follow-up at the end of 2014. Triple treatment group: 153 patients treated primarily with radical prostatectomy with neoadjuvant endocrine treatment, and a majority with adjuvant radiotherapy. Standard radiotherapy group: 702 patients with a treatment of either external radiotherapy or high dose brachytherapy combined with external beam therapy, both modalities in combination with neoadjuvant endocrine therapy. Results: The prostate-cancer-specific mortality was 10% for the triple treatment group and 15% for the standard radiotherapy group during the period, HR = 2.01 (1.17-3.43), p = 0.011. The corresponding overall mortality was 26% vs 29%, HR = 1.54 (1.09-2.17), p = 0.015. High Gleason score was the dominating risk factor for early death due to the disease. Clinical T-stage was not an independent risk factor for death in this population. Conclusion: Adding surgery in a multimodal treatment model in high-risk prostate cancer showed significantly better survival outcome compared with the current standard of radiotherapy. Surgery in this group is, therefore, compelling and that also includes a clinical T3-stage of the disease.

We used 1185 patients with NSCLC in the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer Screening Trial and 984 patients with NSCLC in the Harvard Lung Cancer Susceptibility Study as the discovery and validation datasets, respectively. We selected 6788 SNPs in 71 genes in the TNF/TNFR signaling pathway and extracted their genotyping data from the PLCO genowide-association study (GWAS) dataset. We performed Cox proportional hazards regression analysis to evaluate associations between the identified SNPs and survival and validated the significant SNPs, which were further analyzed for their functional relevance. We found that genotypes of two validated SNPs, IKBKAP rs4978754 CT + TT and TNFRSF1B rs677844 TC + CC, as well as their combined genotypes predicted a better overall survival (P = 0.004, 0.002 and <0.001, respectively). These two validated SNPs were predicted by the RegulomeDB score to be potentially functional. In addition, IKBKAP mRNA expression levels were significantly higher, while TNFRSF1B mRNA expression levels were significantly lower in lung cancer tissues than in adjacent normal tissues (P < 0.001). The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)-based expression quantitative trait loci analysis showed that IKBKAP rs4978754 and TNFRSF1B rs677844 genotypes were significantly associated with their corresponding mRNA expression levels in lung cancer tissues in a recessive model (P = 0.035 and 0.045, respectively).

The magnitude of the contribution of period and/or cohort in a model for trends may be assessed by the percentage of deviance explained and the relative contributions of cohort (C) and period (P) individually, known as the C-P score. The method is illustrated using Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results data (1975-2014) on lung and bronchial cancer mortality in females and prostate and colorectal cancer incidence in males. Smoothed age-period and age-cohort rates provide a useful first step in studies of etiology and the impact of disease control without imposing a restrictive model. We found that, in this data set, cohort predominates for female lung and bronchial cancer and period predominates for male prostate cancer.

However, biparametric MRI (bpMRI) has emerged as a simpler, more rapid MRI approach (fewer scan sequences, no intravenous contrast-media) to reduce costs and facilitate a more widespread clinical implementation. It is unknown how bpMRI and risk models perform conjointly. Therefore, the objective was to develop a predictive model for significant prostate cancer (sPCa) in biopsy-naive men based on bpMRI findings and clinical parameters.  Methods:   Eight hundred and seventy-six biopsy-naive men with clinical suspicion of prostate cancer (prostate-specific antigen, <50 ng/mL; tumour stage, <T3) underwent pre-biopsy prostate bpMRI (T2-weighted and diffusion-weighted) followed by 10-core standard biopsies (all men) and MRI-transrectal ultrasound fusion targeted biopsies of bpMRI-suspicious lesions (suspicion score, ≥3). Prediction models based on bpMRI scores and clinical parameters (age, tumour stage, prostate-specific-antigen [PSA] level, prostatevolume, and PSAdensity) were created to detect sPCa (any biopsy-core with Gleason grade-group, ≥2) and compared by analysing the areas under the curves and decision curves.  Results:   Overall, sPCa was detected in 350/876 men (40%) with median (inter-quartile range) age and PSA level of 65 years (60-70) and 7.3 ng/mL (5.5-10.6), respectively. The model defined by bpMRI scores, age, tumour stage, and PSAdensity had the highest discriminatory power (area under the curve, 0.89), showed good calibration on internal bootstrap validation, and resulted in the greatest net benefit on decision curve analysis. Applying a biopsy risk threshold of 20% meant that 42% of men could avoid a biopsy, 50% fewer insignificant cancers were diagnosed, and only 7% of significant cancers (grade-group, ≥2) were missed.  Conclusions:   A predictive model based on bpMRI scores and clinical parameters significantly improved risk stratification for sPCa in biopsy-naïve men and could be used for clinical decision-making and counselling men prior to prostate biopsies.""","""['Lars Boesen', 'Frederik B Thomsen', 'Nis Nørgaard', 'Vibeke Løgager', 'Ingegerd Balslev', 'Rasmus Bisbjerg', 'Henrik S Thomsen', 'Henrik Jakobsen']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Prostate Cancer Prostatic Dis""","""['Prebiopsy Biparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging Combined with Prostate-specific Antigen Density in Detecting and Ruling out Gleason 7-10 Prostate Cancer in Biopsy-naïve Men.', 'Assessment of the Diagnostic Accuracy of Biparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging for Prostate Cancer in Biopsy-Naive Men: The Biparametric MRI for Detection of Prostate Cancer (BIDOC) Study.', 'Prebiopsy IMPROD Biparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging Combined with Prostate-Specific Antigen Density in the Diagnosis of Prostate Cancer: An External Validation Study.', 'Magnetic resonance imaging-transrectal ultrasound image fusion guidance of prostate biopsies: current status, challenges and future perspectives.', 'Multivariate risk prediction tools including MRI for individualized biopsy decision in prostate cancer diagnosis: current status and future directions.', 'The Prostate Health Index and multi-parametric MRI improve diagnostic accuracy of detecting prostate cancer in Asian populations.', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging-Based Predictive Models for Clinically Significant Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Review.', 'Diagnostic Accuracy of Predictive Models in Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.', 'Comparative Analysis of PSA Density and an MRI-Based Predictive Model to Improve the Selection of Candidates for Prostate Biopsy.', 'The value of magnetic resonance imaging and ultrasonography (MRI/US)-fusion biopsy in clinically significant prostate cancer detection in patients with biopsy-naïve men according to PSA levels: A\xa0propensity score matching analysis.']"""

As much as 70% of men over 70 will develop BPH. Few studies have been conducted to discover the genetic determinants of BPH risk. Understanding the biological basis for this condition may provide necessary insight for development of novel pharmaceutical therapies or risk prediction. We have evaluated SNP-based heritability of BPH in two cohorts and conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of BPH risk using 2,656 cases and 7,763 controls identified from the Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) network. SNP-based heritability estimates suggest that roughly 60% of the phenotypic variation in BPH is accounted for by genetic factors. We used logistic regression to model BPH risk as a function of principal components of ancestry, age, and imputed genotype data, with meta-analysis performed using METAL. The top result was on chromosome 22 in SYN3 at rs2710383 (p-value = 4.6 × 10-7; Odds Ratio = 0.69, 95% confidence interval = 0.55-0.83). Other suggestive signals were near genes GLGC, UNCA13, SORCS1 and between BTBD3 and SPTLC3. We also evaluated genetically-predicted gene expression in prostate tissue. The most significant result was with increasing predicted expression of ETV4 (chr17; p-value = 0.0015). Overexpression of this gene has been associated with poor prognosis in prostate cancer. In conclusion, although there were no genome-wide significant variants identified for BPH susceptibility, we present evidence supporting the heritability of this phenotype, have identified suggestive signals, and evaluated the association between BPH and genetically-predicted gene expression in prostate.""","""['Jacklyn N Hellwege', 'Sarah Stallings', 'Eric S Torstenson', 'Robert Carroll', 'Kenneth M Borthwick', 'Murray H Brilliant', 'David Crosslin', 'Adam Gordon', 'George Hripcsak', 'Gail P Jarvik', 'James G Linneman', 'Parimala Devi', 'Peggy L Peissig', 'Patrick A M Sleiman', 'Hakon Hakonarson', 'Marylyn D Ritchie', 'Shefali Setia Verma', 'Ning Shang', 'Josh C Denny', 'Dan M Roden', 'Digna R Velez Edwards', 'Todd L Edwards']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Sci Rep""","""['A genetic variant near GATA3 implicated in inherited susceptibility and etiology of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS).', 'Genome-wide association study identifies a role for the progesterone receptor in benign prostatic hyperplasia risk.', 'Prevalence and heritability of benign prostatic hyperplasia and LUTS in men aged 40 years or older in Zhengzhou rural areas.', 'CYP17 polymorphisms in relation to risks of prostate cancer and benign prostatic hyperplasia: a population-based study in China.', 'Genetic association between PSA-158G/A polymorphism and the susceptibility of benign prostatic hyperplasia: a meta-analysis.', 'Genetically supported causality between benign prostate hyperplasia and urinary bladder neoplasms: A mendelian randomization study.', 'Xanthoceras sorbifolium Bunge flower extract inhibits benign prostatic hyperplasia in rats.', 'TNF is a potential therapeutic target to suppress prostatic inflammation and hyperplasia in autoimmune disease.', 'Lessons learned from the eMERGE Network: balancing genomics in discovery and practice.', 'E26 transformation-specific variant 4 as a tumor promotor in human cancers through specific molecular mechanisms.']"""

Escape from initial courses of treatment can involve reactivation of embryonic developmental stages, with the formation of polynuclear giant cancer cells (PGCCs). This strategy of dedifferentiation can insulate cancer cells from a variety of treatments and allows a residual subpopulation to reestablish tumors after treatment. Using radiation or docetaxel chemotherapy, we generated PGCCs from prostate cancer cells. Here, we show that expression of acid ceramidase (ASAH1), an enzyme in the sphingolipid pathway linked to therapy resistance and poor outcomes, is elevated in PGCCs. Targeting ASAH1 with shRNA or treatment with the ASAH1 inhibitor, LCL-521, did not impair the formation of PGCCs, but prevented the formation of PGCC progeny that arise through an asymmetric cell division called neosis. Similar results were obtained in lung cancer cells that had been exposed to radiation or cisplatin chemotherapy as stressors. In summary, our data suggest that endoreplication occurs independent of ASAH1 while neosis is ASAH1-dependent in both prostate and lung cancer cells. Because ASAH1 knockout is embryonic lethal but not deleterious to adult animals, targeting this enzyme has the potential to be highly specific to cells undergoing the dedifferentiation process to escape cancer treatments. Pharmacological inhibition of ASAH1 is a potentially powerful strategy to eliminate cells that could otherwise serve as seed populations for recurrence.""","""['Shai White-Gilbertson', 'Ping Lu', 'James S Norris', 'Christina Voelkel-Johnson']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""J Lipid Res""","""['Tamoxifen is a candidate first-in-class inhibitor of acid ceramidase that reduces amitotic division in polyploid giant cancer cells-Unrecognized players in tumorigenesis.', 'Expression of Ceramide Synthase 6 Transcriptionally Activates Acid Ceramidase in a c-Jun N-terminal Kinase (JNK)-dependent Manner.', 'Acid Ceramidase Depletion Impairs Neuronal Survival and Induces Morphological Defects in Neurites Associated with Altered Gene Transcription and Sphingolipid Content.', 'Acid Ceramidase: A Novel Therapeutic Target in Cancer.', 'Acid ceramidase upregulation in prostate cancer: role in tumor development and implications for therapy.', 'Cells in the polyaneuploid cancer cell (PACC) state have increased metastatic potential.', 'Inhibitory effect of Porphyromonas gingivalis-derived phosphoethanolamine dihydroceramide on acid ceramidase expression in oral squamous cells.', 'Polyploid giant cancer cells are dependent on cholesterol for progeny formation through amitotic division.', 'Sphingolipids and Lymphomas: A Double-Edged Sword.', 'CD44+ and CD133+ Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Cells Exhibit DNA Damage Response Pathways and Dormant Polyploid Giant Cancer Cell Enrichment Relating to Their p53 Status.']"""

The functional roles of cholesterol in prostate cancer metastasis are not fully understood. Here, we found that cholesterol induces the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) through extracellular-regulated protein kinases 1/2 pathway activation, which is mediated by EGFR and adipocyte plasma membrane-associated protein (APMAP) accumulation in cholesterol-induced lipid rafts. Mechanistically, APMAP increases the interaction with EGFR substrate 15-related protein (EPS15R) to inhibit the endocytosis of EGFR by cholesterol, thus promoting cholesterol-induced EMT. Both the mRNA and protein levels of APMAP are upregulated in clinical prostate cancer samples. Together, these findings shed light onto an APMAP/EPS15R/EGFR axis that mediates cholesterol-induced EMT of prostate cancer cells. SIGNIFICANCE: This study delineates the molecular mechanisms by which cholesterol increases prostate cancer progression and demonstrates that the binding of cholesterol-induced APMAP with EPS15R inhibits EGFR internalization and activates ERK1/2 to promote EMT.

A single-blinded, two-armed, randomised controlled trial""","""Introduction:   A potential link exists between prostate cancer (PCa) disease and treatment and increased inflammatory levels from gut dysbiosis. This study aims to examine if exercise favourably alters gut microbiota in men receiving androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) for PCa. Specifically, this study will explore whether: (1) exercise improves the composition of gut microbiota and increases the abundance of bacteria associated with health promotion and (2) whether gut health correlates with favourable inflammatory status, bowel function, continence and nausea among patients participating in the exercise intervention.  Methods and analysis:   A single-blinded, two-armed, randomised controlled trial will explore the influence of a 3-month exercise programme (3 days/week) for men with high-risk localised PCa receiving ADT. Sixty patients will be randomly assigned to either exercise intervention or usual care. The primary endpoint (gut health and function assessed via feacal samples) and secondary endpoints (self-reported quality of life via standardised questionnaires, blood biomarkers, body composition and physical fitness) will be measured at baseline and following the intervention. A variety of statistical methods will be used to understand the covariance between microbial diversity and metabolomics profile across time and intervention. An intention-to-treat approach will be utilised for the analyses with multiple imputations followed by a secondary sensitivity analysis to ensure data robustness using a complete cases approach.  Ethics and dissemination:   Ethics approval was obtained from the Human Research Ethics Committee of Edith Cowan University (ID: 19827 NEWTON). Findings will be reported in peer-reviewed publications and scientific conferences in addition to working with national support groups to translate findings for the broader community. If exercise is shown to result in favourable changes in gut microbial diversity, composition and metabolic profile, and reduce gastrointestinal complications in PCa patients receiving ADT, this study will form the basis of a future phase III trial.

However, its role in B-cell malignancies has not been elucidated. To describe the role of Par-4 in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) pathogenesis, we developed a B-cell-specific human Par-4-overexpressing mouse model of CLL using the TCL1 leukemia model. While Par-4 transgenic mice did not display any obvious defects in B-cell development or function, disease burden as evidenced by abundance of CD19+CD5+ B cells in the peripheral blood was significantly reduced in Par-4 × TCL1 mice compared with TCL1 littermates. This conferred a survival advantage on the Par-4-overexpressing mice. In addition, a B-cell-specific knockout model displayed the opposite effect, where lack of Par-4 expression resulted in accelerated disease progression and abbreviated survival in the TCL1 model. Histological and flow cytometry-based analysis of spleen and bone marrow upon euthanasia revealed comparable levels of malignant B-cell infiltration in Par-4 × TCL1 and TCL1 individuals, indicating delayed but pathologically normal disease progression in Par-4 × TCL1 mice. In vivo analysis of splenic B-cell proliferation by 5-ethynyl-2-deoxyuridine incorporation indicated >50% decreased expansion of CD19+CD5+ cells in Par-4 × TCL1 mice compared with TCL1 littermates. Moreover, reduced nuclear p65 levels were observed in Par-4 × TCL1 splenic B cells compared with TCL1, suggesting suppressed NF-κB signaling.

Here, we present long-term survival outcomes and safety of abiraterone acetate plus prednisone and ADT from the final analysis of the LATITUDE study.  Methods:   This is a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, phase 3 trial done at 235 sites in 34 countries. Eligible patients (men aged ≥18 years) had newly diagnosed, histologically or cytologically confirmed prostate cancer with metastases, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0-2, and at least two of the three high-risk prognostic factors (Gleason score of ≥8, presence of three or more lesions on bone scan, or presence of measurable visceral metastasis except lymph node metastasis). Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive abiraterone acetate (1000 mg) once daily orally plus prednisone (5 mg) once daily orally and ADT (abiraterone acetate plus prednisone group) or matching placebos plus ADT (placebo group); each treatment cycle was 28 days. Randomisation was done by a centralised interactive web response system in a country-by-country scheme using permuted block randomisation, stratified by presence of visceral disease and ECOG performance status. The coprimary endpoint of overall survival was assessed in the intention-to-treat population. This study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01715285 and is complete.  Findings:   Between Feb 12, 2013, and Dec 11, 2014, 1209 patients were screened, of whom ten were ineligible because of study site violations. 1199 patients were randomly assigned to either the abiraterone acetate plus prednisone group (n=597) or placebo group (n=602). After the results of the first interim analysis (cutoff date Oct 31, 2016), the study was unmasked to patients and investigators, and patients in the placebo group were allowed to cross over to receive abiraterone acetate and prednisone plus ADT treatment as per a protocol amendment (Feb 15, 2017) in an open-label extension phase of the study (up to 18 months from the protocol amendment). This final analysis (data cutoff Aug 15, 2018) was done after a median follow-up of 51·8 months (IQR 47·2-57·0) and 618 deaths (275 [46%] of 597 in the abiraterone acetate plus prednisone group and 343 [57%] of 602 in the placebo group). Overall survival was significantly longer in the abiraterone acetate plus prednisone group (median 53·3 months [95% CI 48·2-not reached]) than in the placebo group (36·5 months [33·5-40·0]), with a hazard ratio of 0·66 (95% CI 0·56-0·78; p<0·0001). The most common grade 3-4 adverse events were hypertension (125 [21%] in the abiraterone acetate plus prednisone group vs 60 [10%] in the placebo group vs three [4%] in the 72 patients who crossed over from placebo to abiraterone acetate plus prednisone) and hypokalaemia (70 [12%] vs ten [2%] vs two [3%]). Serious adverse events of any grade occurred in 192 (32%) of 597 patients in the abiraterone acetate plus prednisone group, 151 (25%) of 602 in the placebo group, and four (6%) of 72 in the crossover group. The most common treatment-related serious adverse event was hypokalaemia (four [1%] patients in the abiraterone acetate plus prednisone group and none in the other groups). Treatment-related deaths occurred in three (<1%) patients each in the abiraterone acetate plus prednisone group (gastric ulcer perforation, sudden death, and cerebrovascular accident) and the placebo group (sudden death, cerebrovascular accident, and pneumonia), with none in the crossover group.

To facilitate their intraoperative detection during salvage surgery, we recently introduced PSMA-targeted radioguided surgery (RGS).  Objective:   To describe the outcome of a large cohort of patients treated with PSMA-targeted RGS and to establish prognostic factors.  Design, setting, and participants:   A total of 121 consecutive patients with recurrent PC as defined by PSMA-ligand PET (median PSA: 1.13ng/ml) underwent PSMA-targeted RGS.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   The frequency of a complete biochemical response (cBR; PSA <0.2ng/ml) without additional treatment and the duration of biochemical recurrence-free survival (bRFS, time from PSMA-targeted RGS with PSA <0.2ng/ml without further treatment) were evaluated and correlated with preoperatively available clinical variables.  Results and limitations:   In almost all patients (120/121, 99%) metastatic tissue could be removed. A cBR was achieved in 77 patients (66%). The chance of cBR was highest in patients with both low preoperative PSA and a single lesion (38/45: 84%). Median bRFS was 6.4mo in the whole patient cohort and 19.8mo for patients with cBR. Significantly longer median bRFS was observed in patients with a low preoperative PSA value (p=0.004, hazard ratio 1.48, 95% confidence interval 1.13-1.93) and with a single lesion in preoperative PSMA-ligand PET (14.0 vs 2.5mo, p=0.002).  Conclusions:   PSMA-targeted RGS leads to a remarkable interval of bRFS in a subset of patients. The frequency of cBR and the duration of bRFS were highest in patients with a low preoperative PSA value and a single lesion on PSMA-ligand PET.

GNMT serves multiple roles which include a methyl group transfer enzyme and a liver tumor suppressor. Benzo(a)pyrene (BaP), a family member of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH), is a known environmental carcinogen found in coal tar, tobacco smoke, barbecued food and incomplete combustion of auto fuel. BaP recruits cytochrome P450 to transform itself into benzo(a)pyrene-7,8-diol-9,10-epoxide (B(a)PDE), which covalently interacts with DNA causing tumorigenesis. BaP can be detoxified through GNMT and induces GNMT translocation into the cellular nucleus. GNMT translocation is accompanied by phosphorylation, but the role of phosphorylation in GNMT remains to be explored. Using liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry, this study identified serine 9 of GNMT as the phosphorylation site upon BaP treatment. When serine 9 was mutated and lost the capability to be phosphorylated, the occurrence of BaP-induced GNMT nuclear translocation was dramatically decreased. Also, this mutant from of GNMT lost the ability of phosphorylation and increased cytochrome P450 1A1 (Cyp1a) expression upon BaP treatment. In addition, protein kinase C (PKC) and c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) may be required for such phosphorylation. Further characterization of phosphorylated GNMT for its link to BaP may bring new insights into chemical detoxification.""","""['Ming-Hui Yang', 'Chen-Chung Liao', 'Jung-Hsien Hung', 'Xiu-Ting Lai', 'Chia-Hung Yen', 'Yi-Ming Arthur Chen']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""J Food Drug Anal""","""['Glycine N-methyltransferase tumor susceptibility gene in the benzo(a)pyrene-detoxification pathway.', 'Benzoapyrene effects on glycine N-methyltransferase mRNA expression and enzyme activity in Fundulus heteroclitus embryos.', 'Benzoapyrene and glycine N-methyltransferse interactions: gene expression profiles of the liver detoxification pathway.', 'Tumor suppressor gene glycine N-methyltransferase and its potential in liver disorders and hepatocellular carcinoma.', 'The multi-functional roles of GNMT in toxicology and cancer.', 'Targeting protein palmitoylation decreases palmitate‑induced sphere formation of human liver cancer cells.', 'Loss of Glycine N-Methyltransferase Associates with Angiopoietin-Like Protein 8 Expression in High Fat-Diet-Fed Mice.']"""

Elucidation of molecular mechanisms contributing to disease progression is crucial for more accurate prognostication and effective treatments. R-Spondin 3 (RSPO3) is a protein previously implicated in the progression of colorectal and lung cancers. However, a role for RSPO3 in prostate cancer prognosis and behaviour has not been explored.  Methods:   We compare the relative levels of RSPO3 expression between normal prostate tissue and prostate cancer in two independent patient cohorts (Taylor and GSE70768-Cambridge). We also examine the association of biochemical relapse with RSPO3 levels in these cohorts. For elucidation of the biological effect of RSPO3, we use siRNA technology to reduce the levels of RSPO3 in established prostate cancer cell lines, and perform in vitro proliferation, invasion, western blotting for EMT markers and clonogenic survival assays for radiation resistance. Furthermore, we show consequences of RSPO3 knockdown in an established chick chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) assay model of metastasis.  Results:   RSPO3 levels are lower in prostate cancer than normal prostate, with a tendency for further loss in metastatic disease. Patients with lower RSPO3 expression have lower rates of biochemical relapse-free survival. SiRNA-mediated loss of RSPO3 results in no change to clonogenic survival and a lower proliferative rate, but increased invasiveness in vitro with induction of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers. Consistent with these results, lower RSPO3 expression translates to greater metastatic capacity in the CAM assay. Together, our preclinical findings identify a role of RSPO3 downregulation in prostate cancer invasiveness, and provide a potential explanation for how RSPO3 functions as a positive prognostic marker in prostate cancer.""","""['Aruz Mesci', 'Fabrice Lucien', 'Xiaoyong Huang', 'Eric H Wang', 'David Shin', 'Michelle Meringer', 'Christianne Hoey', 'Jessica Ray', 'Paul C Boutros', 'Hon S Leong', 'Stanley K Liu']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""J Transl Med""","""['RSPO3 is a marker candidate for predicting tumor aggressiveness in ovarian cancer.', 'RSPO3 promotes the aggressiveness of bladder cancer via Wnt/β-catenin and Hedgehog signaling pathways.', 'TRIP13 is a predictor for poor prognosis and regulates cell proliferation, migration and invasion in prostate cancer.', 'Epithelial-mesenchymal transition in prostate cancer: an overview.', 'MicroRNAs and epithelial-mesenchymal transition in prostate cancer.', 'IL1R1+ cancer-associated fibroblasts drive tumor development and immunosuppression in colorectal cancer.', 'Integration of multiomics data shows down regulation of mismatch repair and tubulin pathways in triple-negative chemotherapy-resistant breast tumors.', 'Identification and construction of a 13-gene risk model for prognosis prediction in hepatocellular carcinoma patients.', 'Exploring the Wnt Pathway as a Therapeutic Target for Prostate Cancer.', 'A Review of Prostate Organogenesis and a Role for iPSC-Derived Prostate Organoids to Study Prostate Development and Disease.']"""

They participated in a focus group, which took place on the premises of the charity and was audio-recorded. The recording was transcribed and the data were analysed employing thematic analysis.Results: Three overarching themes were developed: Discharge - misconceptions and uncertainties; Survivorship - challenges and ways of coping; Black men and PCa: real and potential discrimination. Participants expressed concerns regarding the lack of information and clarity about what discharge meant, the quality of follow-up care, especially the levels of specialist knowledge among GPs, and the impact of side-effects, particularly erectile dysfunction (ED). Participants linked ED with stereotypes of Black male sexuality, particularly in relation to difficulties of expressing their emotions and psychological distress. African-Caribbean men face particular challenges in dealing with the side-effects of treatment for PCa, which are linked to socially-constructed ideas of masculinity.Conclusion: There needs to be a greater focus in primary care on understanding these issues and providing individualised culturally-sensitive care.

A prominent driver of health-related decision-making is emotion, yet little work has examined the impact emotions may have on decisional regret. The goal of this study was to explore experiences, perceptions, and emotions of prostate cancer survivors in relation to their diagnostic and treatment decision-making processes, prostate cancer treatment, and outcomes. Additionally, we sought to identify factors that might explain differences in prostate cancer outcomes between African and European Americans.  Design:   This mixed-methods study utilized a convergent parallel design, in which quantitative and qualitative data were collected simultaneously and then integrated to more robustly explain relationships between variables. Survivors were eligible for the study if they had been previously diagnosed with localized prostate cancer and were no more than six months post-treatment. The study was guided by the Risk as Feelings Model, which predicts the relationship between emotion and cognition in high-risk decision-making.  Results:   No men experienced decisional regret following treatment, even if they experienced side effects. While all men reported being surprised about their prostate cancer diagnosis, strong negative emotions were more common among men under 65. Family support and spirituality appeared to mitigate negative emotions. Perceived authenticity of provider communication was the most influential mediator in men's decision-making and positive perceptions of their outcomes.  Conclusions:   To mitigate the impact emotional responses have on decision-making and post-treatment regret, providers should explore alternate therapies (e.g. counseling for men diagnosed with prostate cancer at a young age) and include family members in prostate cancer treatment discussions. Most importantly, providers should be aware of the importance of quality communication on men's cognitive and emotional processes and their perceptions of treatment outcomes.""","""['Otis L Owens', 'Robin M Estrada', 'Kim Johnson', 'Micheal Cogdell', 'Daniel B Fried', 'Lucy Gansauer', 'Simon Kim']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Ethn Health""","""['Race, Decisional Regret and Prostate Cancer Beliefs: Identifying Targets to Reduce Racial Disparities in Prostate Cancer.', 'Treatment decisional regret among men with prostate cancer: Racial differences and influential factors in the North Carolina Health Access and Prostate Cancer Treatment Project (HCaP-NC).', 'Spirituality is associated with less treatment regret in men with localized prostate cancer.', 'Examining the effectiveness and implementation of patient treatment decision-aid tools for men with localised prostate cancer: A systematic review.', 'Why do patients regret their prostate cancer treatment?

Identifying cell factors that predict metastatic potential could guide both prognosis and treatment.  Methods:   We used Cell-SELEX to screen an RNA aptamer library for differential binding to prostate cancer cell lines with high vs. low metastatic potential. Mass spectroscopy, immunoblot, and immunohistochemistry were used to identify and validate aptamer targets. Aptamer properties were tested in vitro, in xenograft models, and in clinical biopsies. Gene expression datasets were queried for target associations in cancer.  Results:   We identified a novel aptamer (Apt63) that binds to the beta subunit of F1Fo ATP synthase (ATP5B), present on the plasma membrane of certain normal and cancer cells. Apt63 bound to plasma membranes of multiple aggressive breast and prostate cell lines, but not to normal breast and prostate epithelial cells, and weakly or not at all to non-metastasizing cancer cells; binding led to rapid cell death. A single intravenous injection of Apt63 induced rapid, tumor cell-selective binding and cytotoxicity in MDA-MB-231 xenograft tumors, associated with endonuclease G nuclear translocation and DNA fragmentation. Apt63 was not toxic to non-transformed epithelial cells in vitro or adjacent normal tissue in vivo. In breast cancer tissue arrays, plasma membrane staining with Apt63 correlated with tumor stage (p < 0.0001, n = 416) and was independent of other cancer markers. Across multiple datasets, ATP5B expression was significantly increased relative to normal tissue, and negatively correlated with metastasis-free (p = 0.0063, 0.00039, respectively) and overall (p = 0.050, 0.0198) survival.  Conclusion:   Ecto-ATP5B binding by Apt63 may disrupt an essential survival mechanism in a subset of tumors with high metastatic potential, and defines a novel category of cancers with potential vulnerability to ATP5B-targeted therapy. Apt63 is a unique tool for elucidating the function of surface ATP synthase, and potentially for predicting and treating metastatic breast and prostate cancer.""","""['S Speransky', 'P Serafini', 'J Caroli', 'S Bicciato', 'M E Lippman', 'N H Bishopric']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Breast Cancer Res Treat""","""['Ectopic expression of the ATP synthase β subunit on the membrane of PC-3M cells supports its potential role in prostate cancer metastasis.', 'ATP synthase ecto-α-subunit: a novel therapeutic target for breast cancer.', 'In vitro selection of aptamer S1 against MCF-7 human breast cancer cells.', 'Aptamer selection and applications for breast cancer diagnostics and therapy.', 'Advances of aptamer-based clinical applications for the diagnosis and therapy of cancer.', 'Targeted delivery of RNAi to cancer cells using RNA-ligand displaying exosome.', 'Current Methods for Identifying Plasma Membrane Proteins as Cancer Biomarkers.', 'Spatial and temporal dynamics of ATP synthase from mitochondria toward the cell surface.', 'Aptamer-Based Tumor-Targeted Diagnosis and Drug Delivery.', 'The SKBR3 cell-membrane proteome reveals telltales of aberrant cancer cell proliferation and targets for precision medicine applications.']"""

Cell physiology and homeostasis is regulated by microRNAs in diverse microenvironment. In this investigation we have identified conserved miR-193a target sites within the 3'-UTR of MLL1 gene transcript. Utilizing wild type and mutated 3'-UTR constructs and luciferase reporter assays we have clearly demonstrated that miR-193a directly targets the 3'-UTR region of the MLL1 mRNA. Ectopic expression of miR-193a modulated global H3K4 mono-, di- and tri-methylation levels and affects the expression of CAV1, a gene which is specifically modulated by H3K4me3. To determine the implications of this in vitro finding in aberrant physiological conditions we analyzed prostate cancer tissue samples. In this context miR-193a RNA was undetectable and MLL1 was highly expressed with concomitantly high levels of H3K4me, H3K4me2, and H3K4me3 enrichment in the promoters of MLL1 responsive genes. Finally, we showed that prolonged ectopic expression of miR-193a inhibits growth and cell migration, and induces apoptosis. Thus, while our study unveils amplitude of the epigenome, including miRnome it establishes that; (i) miR-193a directly target MLL1 mRNA, (ii) miR-193a impair MLL1 protein production, (iii) miR-193a reduces the overall methylation marks of the genome.""","""['Dipta Sengupta', 'Moonmoon Deb', 'Swayamsiddha Kar', 'Sabnam Parbin', 'Nibedita Pradhan', 'Samir Kumar Patra']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Gene""","""['DNA methylation and not H3K4 trimethylation dictates the expression status of miR-152 gene which inhibits migration of breast cancer cells via DNMT1/CDH1 loop.', 'Reprogramming of the Epigenome by MLL1 Links Early-Life Environmental Exposures to Prostate Cancer Risk.', 'Involvement of aberrantly activated HOTAIR/EZH2/miR-193a feedback loop in progression of prostate cancer.', 'MLL1/WDR5 complex in leukemogenesis and epigenetic regulation.', 'Mixed-Lineage Leukemia Fusions and Chromatin in Leukemia.', 'A microRNA signature for clinical outcomes of pediatric ALL patients treated with TPOG protocols.', 'Histone Methyltransferase MLL1 Mediates Oxidative Stress and Apoptosis upon Deoxynivalenol Exposure in the Intestinal Porcine Epithelial Cells.', 'Histone Modifications and Non-Coding RNAs: Mutual Epigenetic Regulation and Role in Pathogenesis.', 'Mixed Lineage Leukemia 1 Promoted Neuron Apoptosis in Ischemic Penumbra via Regulating ASK-1/TNF-α Complex.', 'Restoration of miR-193a expression is tumor-suppressive in MYC amplified Group 3 medulloblastoma.']"""

We hypothesized that a survival benefit might be associated with the use of NU in that setting and tested this hypothesis within a large population-based cohort.  Patients and methods:   Within the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database (2004-2014), we identified 1174 patients with mUTUC. Kaplan-Meier plots, as well as multivariable Cox regression models (MCRMs), relying on inverse probability after treatment weighting and landmark analyses, were used to test the effect of NU versus no surgical treatment on cancer-specific mortality (CSM) in patients with mUTUC.  Results:   Of 1174 patients with mUTUC, 449 (38%) underwent NU. The rate of NU decreased over time from 47.1% to 34.6% (estimated annual percentage change, -4%; P = .006]. In MCRMs, NU achieved independent predictor status for lower CSM (hazard ratio [HR], 0.55; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.46-0.66; P < .001). In MCRMs stratified according to chemotherapy, NU also achieved independent predictor status for lower CSM, both in patients who received (n = 597; 50.9%) (HR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.53-0.87; P = .002) or did not receive (n = 574; 49%) (HR, 0.44; 95% CI, 0.33-0.58; P < .001) chemotherapy.

To investigate which clinical and radiological characteristics influence the clinician to biopsy a PI-RADS 3 lesion.  Materials and methods:   mpMRI PI-RADS 3 lesions scored by 1 out of 3 highly specialized radiologists in a single high-volume center during the period March 2015 to August 2017 were investigated. This score was based on T2 weighted and diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) sequences. Clinical characteristics of all patients with PI-RADS 3 lesions were collected from medical records. Radiological characteristics were collected from radiology reports. Some radiological characteristics such as apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) in a region of interest at the tumor site and ADC at a site contralateral to the tumor site were calculated on DWI sequences. Cox regression analysis was performed to identify which characteristics could predict csPCa in PI-RADS 3 lesions and which characteristics could influence the behavior of a clinician whether or not to biopsy a PI-RADS 3 lesion.  Results:   csPCa could be detected in 31 out of 131 patients with PI-RADS 3 lesions (22.9%). A lower median prostate volume (p = 0.015) and a lower ratio of ADC of the tumor on ADC of the contralateral prostate (ADCT/ADCCLP) (p < 0.001) significantly predisposed for csPCa in multivariate logistic regression. For peripheral zone lesions, a diagnostic model with biopsy of only those PI-RADS 3 lesions with a prostate volume <44 cc and a ratio of ADCT/ADCCLP < 70% showed a sensitivity for detection of csPCa of 59% with a specificity of 88%.

For transition zone lesions, previous negative biopsies (p = 0.044) predisposed for csPCa.  Conclusion:   Prostate volume and the ratio of ADC tumor on ADC of the contralateral prostate have the potential to predict csPCa in PI-RADS 3 lesions with a sensitivity of 59% and specificity of 88%.

Radiomics features were extracted from peripheral zone (PZ), transition zone (TZ), and lesion areas segmented on images obtained by T2-weighted imaging (T2WI), diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), and its derivative apparent-diffusion coefficient (ADC) imaging. The individual prediction model, built using the clinical data and biparametric MRI features (Bp signature), was prepared using data of 232 patients and validated using data of 99 patients. The predictive performance was calculated and demonstrated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, calibration curves, and decision curves.  Results:   The Bp signature, based on the six selected radiomics features of bp-MRI, showed better discrimination in the validation cohort (area under the curve [AUC], 0.92) than on each subcategory images (AUC, 0.81 on T2WI; AUC, 0.77 on DWI; AUC, 0.89 on ADC). The differential diagnostic efficiency was poorer with the clinical model (AUC, 0.73), built using the selected independent clinical risk factors with statistical significance (P < 0.05), than with the Bp signature. Discrimination efficiency improved when including the Bp signature and clinical factors [i.e., the individual prediction model (AUC, 0.93)].

We observed substantially high amounts of STAMBPL1 proteins in androgen-independent prostate cancer PC3 and DU145 cell lines. STAMBPL1 RNAi depletion triggered caspase-3/-7-dependent apoptosis in PC3 and DU145 cells. STAMBPL1 knockdown-induced apoptosis was accompanied by accumulation of cellular ROS and a decrease in endogenous caspase inhibitor XIAP protein content. Treatment cells with antioxidant NAC delayed STAMBPL1 silencing-induced apoptosis, whereas ectopic expression of XIAP almost completely abrogated apoptosis. We further elucidated that STAMBPL1 knockdown diverted XIAP protein to lysosomal degradation pathway.

MHC class I polypeptide related sequence A (MICA) is an innate immunity protein involved in tumor immunoevasion. Due to a lack of reports of race-specific expression of MICA in PCa, we evaluated MICA expression in patients' tumors and in cell lines from a racially diverse origin. Immunohistochemistry was done on a tissue microarray (TMA) with antibodies against MICA. Tumor MICA mRNA was assessed by data mining using Oncomine and PROGeneV2. Surface MICA and release rate of soluble (s) MICA was evaluated in PCa cell lines originally derived from African American (MDA-PCa-2b) or Caucasian (LNCaP and DU-145) PCa patients. Prostate tumor tissue had a 1.7-fold higher MICA expression relative to normal tissue (p < .0001). MICA immunoreactivity in PCa tissue from AAM was 24% lower (p = .002) compared to CAM. Survival analysis revealed a marginal association of low MICA with poor overall survival (OS) (p = .058). By data mining analysis, a 2.9-fold higher level of MICA mRNA was evidenced in tumor compared to normal tissue (p < .0001). Tumors from AAM had 24% lower levels of MICA mRNA compared to tumors from CAM (p = .038), and poor prognosis was found for patients with lower MICA mRNA (p = .028). By flow cytometry analysis, cell fraction positive for surface MICA was of 3% in MDA-PCa-2b cells, 54% in DU-145 cells, and 67% in LNCaP cells (p < .0001). sMICA was detected in DU-145 and LNCaP cells, but was not detected in MDA-PCa-2b cells. Both LNCaP and DU-145 cells were sensitive to cytolysis mediated by Natural killer (NK) cells. MDA-PCa-2b cells, however were between 1.3-fold at 10:1 Effector:Target (E:T) ratio (p < .0001) and 2-fold at 50:1 E:T ratio (p < .0001) more resistant to NK-mediated cytolysis relative to cells from Caucasian origin.

We compared the predictive abilities of TRUS vs MRI relative to intraoperative TRUS (iTRUS) to assess the role of mpMRI in brachytherapy preplanning.  Materials and methods:   Retrospective analysis was performed on 32 patients who underwent iTRUS-guided prostate LDR brachytherapy as either mono- or combination therapy. 56.3% had pTRUS-only volume studies and 43.7% had both 3T-mpMRI and pTRUS preplanning. MRI was used for preplanning and its image fusion with iTRUS was also used for intraoperative guidance of seed placement. Differences in gland volume, seed number, and activity and procedure time were examined, as well as the identification of lesions suspicious for tumor foci. Pearson correlation coefficient and Fisher's Z test were used to estimate associations between continuous measures.  Results:   There was good correlation of planning volumes between iTRUS and either pTRUS or MRI (r = 0.89, r = 0.77), not impacted by the addition of hormonal therapy (P = 0.65, P = 0.33). Both consistently predicted intraoperative seed number (r = 0.87, r = 0.86). MRI/TRUS fusion did not significantly increase surgical or anesthesia time (P = 0.10, P = 0.46). mpMRI revealed suspicious focal lesions in 11 of 14 cases not visible on pTRUS, that when correlated with histopathology, were incorporated into the plan.  Conclusions:   Relative to pTRUS, MRI yielded reliable preplanning measures, supporting the role of MRI-only LDR treatment planning. mpMRI carries numerous diagnostic, staging and preplanning advantages that facilitate better patient selection and delivery of novel dose escalation and targeted therapy, with no additional surgical or anesthesia time. Prospective studies assessing its impact on treatment planning and delivery can serve to establish mpMRI as the standard of care in LDR prostate brachytherapy planning.""","""['Elisha T Fredman', 'Bryan J Traughber', 'Andrew Gross', 'Tarun Podder', 'Valdir Colussi', 'Robert Vinkler', 'Mitchell Machtay', 'Rodney J Ellis']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""J Appl Clin Med Phys""","""['Dosimetric evaluation of MRI-to-ultrasound automated image registration algorithms for prostate brachytherapy.', 'Intraoperative planning and evaluation of permanent prostate brachytherapy: report of the American Brachytherapy Society.', 'MRI-based preplanning in low-dose-rate prostate brachytherapy.', 'Clinical evaluation of an MRI-to-ultrasound deformable image registration algorithm for prostate brachytherapy.', 'Use of three-dimensional radiation therapy planning tools and intraoperative ultrasound to evaluate high dose rate prostate brachytherapy implants.', 'Case Report: Role of an Iodinated Rectal Hydrogel Spacer, SpaceOAR Vue™, in the Context of Low-Dose-Rate Prostate Brachytherapy, for Enhanced Post-Operative Contouring to Aid in Accurate Implant Evaluation and Dosimetry.', 'Detection of individual prostate cancer via multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging in own material - initial experience.']"""

Nevertheless, retrospective strategy and possibility of extra-prostatic extension overshadowed the accurateness of the aforementioned cut-off value. To define a more precise PSA nadir value, we estimated serum PSA after cystoprostatectomy in cases with bladder urothelial cancer and no evidence of prostate cancer.  Materials and methods:   Study population consists of 52 subsequent patients who underwent radical cystoprostatectomy for muscle-invasive bladder cancer between December 2010 and December 2013. Patients with prostate adenocarcinoma and/or high grade prostate intraepithelial neoplasia were excluded from enrollment. Other exclusion criteria were prostate involvement with urothelial carcinoma, neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Between all cases, 41 were enrolled for study. Serum PSA level was measured using immunochemiluminescence method among 6 months to 3 years after operation in study participants.  Results:   Forty-one patients with mean age of 66.4 ± 8.9 were assessed in this study. Average serum PSA level after radical cysto-prostatectomy was .037 ± .031 ng/mL (from .002 to .1). Serum PSA level was not impressed with type of diversion or interval between operation and PSA measurement. Average serum PSA level in this study was meaningfully lesser than .2 ng/mL which is contemplated as PSA nadir value after RP.  Conclusion:   Serum PSA level of 0.2 ng/mL as the definition for biochemical recurrence after RP may delay salvage treatment.

Patients and methods:   From April 2013 to December 2017, 304 men with elevated prostate-specific antigen levels (< 20 ng/mL) or abnormal digital rectal examination and positive MRI findings underwent transrecta ultrasound and MRI-targeted transperineal 4-core with 14-core systematic biopsy. MRI findings were prospectively collected and evaluated using Prostate Imaging-Reporting and Data System version 2 (PI-RADS), and scores ≥3 were considered positive. SC was defined as Gleason score ≥3 + 4 or maximum cancer length ≥5 mm. We evaluated the diagnostic performance of TgB and SyB to detect SC and characterized men who could avoid SyB without missing SC.  Results:   Detection rates of any cancer and SC for TgB/SyB/their combination were 59%/63%/68% and 51%/52%/61%, respectively. TgB alone missed 14% (29/207) of any cancer and 16% (29/184) of SC detected using TgB with SyB. In uni- and multivariable analyses, PI-RADS scores of 3 to 4 were independent predictors for missing SC using TgB alone. When restricted to 81 men with PI-RADS scores of 5 (27%), SC was missed using TgB alone only in 3 (4.6% vs. 22% for the remaining 223 men; P = .007).

However, the mechanisms underlying SMURF2 inactivation in human malignancies remain elusive, as SMURF2 is rarely found mutated or deleted in cancers. We hypothesized that SMURF2 might have a distinct molecular biodistribution in cancer versus normal cells and tissues. The expression and localization of SMURF2 were analyzed in 666 human normal and cancer tissues, with primary focus on prostate and breast tumors. These investigations were accompanied by SMURF2 gene expression analyses, subcellular fractionation and biochemical studies, including SMURF2's interactome analysis. We found that while in normal cells and tissues SMURF2 has a predominantly nuclear localization, in prostate and aggressive breast carcinomas SMURF2 shows a significantly increased cytoplasmic sequestration, associated with the disease progression. Mechanistic studies showed that the nuclear export machinery was not involved in cytoplasmic accumulation of SMURF2, while uncovered that its stability is markedly increased in the cytoplasmic compartment. Subsequent interactome analyses pointed to 14-3-3s as SMURF2 interactors, which could potentially affect its localization. These findings link the distorted expression of SMURF2 to human carcinogenesis and suggest the alterations in SMURF2 localization as a potential mechanism obliterating its tumor suppressor activities.""","""['Andrea Emanuelli', 'Dhanoop Manikoth Ayyathan', 'Praveen Koganti', 'Pooja Anil Shah', 'Liat Apel-Sarid', 'Biagio Paolini', 'Rajesh Detroja', 'Milana Frenkel-Morgenstern', 'Michael Blank']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Cancers (Basel)""","""['The Emerging Role of E3 Ubiquitin Ligase SMURF2 in the Regulation of Transcriptional Co-Repressor KAP1 in Untransformed and Cancer Cells and Tissues.', 'SMURF2 prevents detrimental changes to chromatin, protecting human dermal fibroblasts from chromosomal instability and tumorigenesis.', 'Suppression of human tumor cell proliferation by Smurf2-induced senescence.', 'The Post-translational Modifications of Smurf2 in TGF-β Signaling.', 'Involvement of the multiple tumor suppressor genes and 12-lipoxygenase in human prostate cancer.

Two hundred participants will be randomized to either the PALS intervention, a 6-month structured diet and exercise program adapted from the Diabetes Prevention Program followed by 6 months of maintenance, or control (general diet and physical activity guidelines delivered in a single session). The PALS intervention involves one-on-one instruction with a registered dietitian and exercise physiologist to achieve the study goal of loss of 7% of baseline weight. Participation is coordinated so that the 6-month time point coincides with the participants' standard-of-care AS prostate biopsy. Primary outcomes will evaluate the intervention effects on circulating and tissue markers of glucose and insulin regulation, health-related quality of life and pathologic upgrading on follow-up prostate biopsies. Additional analyses will determine whether changes in weight and glucose regulation can be sustained for 6 months after the end of instruction.

Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) boost can potentially mimic high-dose-rate boost and could be a viable alternative. Here we report the long-term outcomes of a phase 1 dose-escalation trial of single-fraction SBRT boost.  Methods and materials:   Patients had intermediate-risk PCa and were accrued to 3 different SBRT single-fraction dose-level cohorts (10 Gy, 12.5 Gy, and 15 Gy). All received supplemental radiation therapy afterwards (37.5 Gy in 15 fractions). Three gold fiducials were implanted for image guidance. Patients were simulated and treated with a foley catheter and intrarectal balloon. A T2 magnetic resonance imaging scan was used for contouring, and a cine magnetic resonance imaging scan was used to calculate patient-specific internal target volume margins. Toxicity and quality-of-life data were collected using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v3.0 and the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite.  Results:   30 patients were accrued, 10 in each cohort. Median follow-up was 72 months. 60% had unfavorable intermediate-risk PCa. Two patients in the 15 Gy cohort developed late grade ≥3 gastrointestinal and genitourinary toxicity, with 1 patient suffering from a grade-4 rectal fistula after a rectal ulcer was biopsied repeatedly. Two patients had biochemical failure. Median PSA nadir was 0.4 ng/mL with 10 Gy, 0.09 ng/mL with 12.5 Gy and 0.07 ng/mL with 15 Gy. Median PSA at 4 years as well as proportion achieving a nadir <0.2 ng/mL improved significantly with higher doses. There was no significant change in quality of life from baseline in any of the domains, and the minimal clinically important change was not statistically different between the 3 cohorts.

Hence, this network meta-analysis was aimed to provide a hierarchy of different therapeutic regimens for mPCa.  Methods:   Relevant studies were retrieved comprehensively by searching the online databases of PubMed, EMBASE and Web of Science, published before July 1st, 2018. With the help of R-3.4.0 software and ""gemtc-0.8.2"" package, network meta-analysis was performed by random-effect model within a Bayesian framework.

Results:   A total of 55,363 cases from 17 studies were ultimately involved in this study. Ten different therapeutic regimens and three clinical endpoints were finally assessed. As illustrated by our results, local therapy (such as radical prostatectomy or radiation therapy) could provide a relatively more favorable survival rate than systematic therapies (no local therapy, androgen deprivation therapy or androgen deprivation therapy + chemotherapy).

However, the upstream events responsible for defective autophagy are yet to be delineated. The present study suggests that chronic Cd exposure induces endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress that triggers the phosphorylation of stress transducers [protein kinase R-like ER Kinase- (PERK), eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2-alpha- (eIF2-α) and Activating Transcription Factor 4 -(ATF-4)], resulting in defective autophagy that protects Cd-exposed RWPE-1 cells. On the other hand, inhibition of the ATF4 stress inducer by siRNA blocked the Cd-induced defective autophagy in transforming cells. While dissecting the upstream activators of ER stress, we found that increased expression of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is responsible for ER stress in Cd-exposed RWPE-1 cells. Overexpression of antioxidants (SOD1/SOD2) mitigates Cd-induced ROS that results in inhibition of ER stress and autophagy in prostate epithelial cells.

Our aim was to analyze long-term bPFS of brachytherapy treated patients.  Materials and methods:   Retrospective analysis of 1457 patients with low and intermediate risk prostate cancer treated with brachytherapy alone (1255) or combined with EBRT (202). Six-months ADT was administrated for all EBRT combined patients and for prostate volume downsizing when >55 cc (328). Failure was by the Phoenix definition. Kaplan-Meier analysis and multivariate Cox regression estimated and compared 10-yr and 15-yr rates of bPFS.  Results:   Median follow-up was 6.1 yr. Ten and 15-yr bPFS rates of the entire cohort were 93.2% and 89.2%, respectively. On multivariate analysis, PSA density (PSAD), ADT and clinical stage were significantly associated with failure. The most powerful independent factor was PSAD with a HR of 3.5 (95% CI, 1.7-7.4) for PSAD above 0.15. No significant difference was found between low and intermediate risks patients regardless of treatment regimen. However, comparison of two intermediate risk groups, Gleason score (GS) 7, PSA<20 ng/ml versus GS≤6 and PSA = 10-20 ng/ml, revealed 10- and 15-yr bPFS rates of 94.2% and 94.2% compared to 88.2% and 79.9%, (P = 0.022), respectively. ADT improved bPFS rates in low risk patients. The ten and 15-yr bPFS rates were 97.6% and 94.6% compared to 92.3% and 88.2%, (P = 0.020), respectively.  Conclusions:   Our retrospective large scale study suggests that brachytherapy provides excellent long-term bPFS rates in low and intermediate risk disease. Combination of brachytherapy with EBRT yields favorable outcomes in GS 7 intermediate risk patients and short-term ADT has a positive effect on outcomes in low risk patients. Further prospective studies are warranted to discriminate the role of adding either EBRT and/or ADT to brachytherapy protocols.""","""['Haim Matzkin', 'Juza Chen', 'Rubi Agai', 'Tomer Ziv-Baran', 'Nicola J Mabjeesh']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['American Brachytherapy Society Task Group Report: Use of androgen deprivation therapy with prostate brachytherapy-A systematic literature review.', 'Do androgen deprivation and the biologically equivalent dose matter in low-dose-rate brachytherapy for intermediate-risk prostate cancer?', 'The need for androgen deprivation therapy in patients with intermediate-risk prostate cancer treated with dose-escalated external beam radiation therapy.', 'High-risk prostate cancer with Gleason score 8-10 and PSA level ≤15 ng/mL treated with permanent interstitial brachytherapy.', 'Comparative analysis of prostate-specific antigen free survival outcomes for patients with low, intermediate and high risk prostate cancer treatment by radical therapy.

Androgen deprivation therapy has been widely used to inhibit PCa growth but eventually fails in many patients. Androgen receptor and its downstream molecules like microRNAs could be promising therapeutic targets. We aimed to investigate the involvement of miR-21 in PCa tumorigenesis. We found that miR-21 was an unfavorable factor and correlated positively with tumor grade in PCa patients from TCGA database. MiR-21 was more highly expressed in androgen-independent PCa cells than in androgen-dependent PCa cells. Overexpression of miR-21 promoted androgen-dependent and -independent PCa cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and resistance to apoptosis. Furthermore, increased miR-21 expression promoted mouse xenograft growth. We identified nine genes differentially expressed in PCa tumors and normal tissue which could be potential targets of miR-21 by bioinformatic analyses. We demonstrate that miR-21 directly targeted KLF5 and inhibited KLF5 mRNA and protein levels in PCa. STRING and functional enrichment analysis results suggest that GSK3B might be regulated by KLF5. Our findings demonstrate that miR-21 promotes the tumorigenesis of PCa cells by directly targeting KLF5. These biological effects are mediated through upregulation of GSK3B and activation of the AKT signaling pathway.""","""['Chen Guan', 'Lingling Zhang', 'Sixuan Wang', 'Luye Long', 'Huaibin Zhou', 'Shihan Qian', 'Mengni Ma', 'Fumao Bai', 'Qing H Meng', 'Jianxin Lyu']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Cancer Biol Ther""","""['circCRKL suppresses the progression of prostate cancer cells by regulating the miR-141/KLF5 axis.', 'The miR-218/GAB2 axis regulates proliferation, invasion and EMT via the PI3K/AKT/GSK-3β pathway in prostate cancer.', 'Oncogenic microRNA-4534 regulates PTEN pathway in prostate cancer.', 'Mechanism of Anti-Cancer Activity of Curcumin on Androgen-Dependent and Androgen-Independent Prostate Cancer.', 'The transcriptional regulation of miR-21, its multiple transcripts, and their implication in prostate cancer.', 'miRNA-21 as High Potential Prostate Cancer Biomarker in Prostate Cancer Patients in Indonesia.', 'Molecular Mechanisms of Noncoding RNA in the Occurrence of Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Metal-organic frameworks-based biosensor for microRNA detection in prostate cancer cell lines.', 'MicroRNA-21 is immunosuppressive and pro-metastatic via separate mechanisms.', 'The clinical significance of circulating miR-21, miR-142, miR-143, and miR-146a in patients with prostate cancer.']"""

In this paper, we describe a novel methodology to segment prostate whole gland (WG), central gland (CG), and peripheral zone (PZ), where PZ + CG = WG, from T2W and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) map prostate MR images.  Methods:   We designed two similar models each made up of two U-Nets to delineate the WG, CG, and PZ from T2W and ADC map MR images, separately. The U-Net, which is a modified version of a fully convolutional neural network, includes contracting and expanding paths with convolutional, pooling, and upsampling layers. Pooling and upsampling layers help to capture and localize image features with a high spatial consistency. We used a dataset consisting of 225 patients (combining 153 and 72 patients with and without clinically significant prostate cancer) imaged with multiparametric MRI at 3 Tesla.  Results and conclusion:   Our proposed model for prostate zonal segmentation from T2W was trained and tested using 1154 and 1587 slices of 100 and 125 patients, respectively. Median of Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) on test dataset for prostate WG, CG, and PZ were 95.33 ± 7.77%, 93.75 ± 8.91%, and 86.78 ± 3.72%, respectively. Designed model for regional prostate delineation from ADC map images was trained and validated using 812 and 917 slices from 100 and 125 patients. This model yielded a median DSC of 92.09 ± 8.89%, 89.89 ± 10.69%, and 86.1 ± 9.56% for prostate WG, CG, and PZ on test samples, respectively. Further investigation indicated that the proposed algorithm reported high DSC for prostate WG segmentation from both T2W and ADC map MR images irrespective of WG size. In addition, segmentation accuracy in terms of DSC does not significantly vary among patients with or without significant tumors.  Significance:   We describe a method for automated prostate zonal segmentation using T2W and ADC map MR images independent of prostate size and the presence or absence of tumor. Our results are important in terms of clinical perspective as fully automated methods for ADC map images, which are considered as one of the most important sequences for prostate cancer detection in the PZ and CG, have not been reported previously.""","""['Fatemeh Zabihollahy', 'Nicola Schieda', 'Satheesh Krishna Jeyaraj', 'Eranga Ukwatta']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Dual optimization based prostate zonal segmentation in 3D MR images.', 'Fully automated detection of prostate transition zone tumors on T2-weighted and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) map MR images using U-Net ensemble.', 'Fully automated localization of prostate peripheral zone tumors on apparent diffusion coefficient map MR images using an ensemble learning method.', 'Diffusion-weighted MR of the brain: methodology and clinical application.', 'Investigation and benchmarking of U-Nets on prostate segmentation tasks.', 'Development and clinical utility analysis of a prostate zonal segmentation model on T2-weighted imaging: a multicenter study.', 'Automatic segmentation of prostate zonal anatomy on MRI: a systematic review of the literature.', 'A review of artificial intelligence in prostate cancer detection on imaging.', 'CAT-Net: A Cross-Slice Attention Transformer Model for Prostate Zonal Segmentation in MRI.', 'Segmentation of the prostate, its zones, anterior fibromuscular stroma, and urethra on the MRIs and multimodality image fusion using U-Net model.']"""

However, the clinical significance and the biological roles of USP9X in prostate cancer remain unexplored. In the present study, an investigation into the expression and clinical significance of USP9X in prostate cancer revealed that USP9X expression was downregulated in prostate cancer tissues compared with that in healthy tissues. In addition, decreased USP9X expression was associated with a higher Gleason score and local invasion. Depletion of USP9X in prostate cancer LNCaP and PC‑3 cells by small interfering RNA promoted cell invasion and migration. Furthermore, USP9X depletion upregulated matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9) and the phosphorylation of dynamin‑related protein 1 (DRP1). Notably, a significant increase in phosphorylated extracellular signal‑regulated kinase (ERK), an upstream activator of MMP9 and DRP1, was observed. To investigate whether ERK activation was able to increase MMP9 protein levels and induce DRP1 phosphorylation, an ERK inhibitor was used, demonstrating that ERK‑mediated MMP9 production and change in mitochondrial function was critical for the biological function of USP9X in prostate cancer cells. In conclusion, the present study demonstrated that USP9X is downregulated in prostate cancer and functions as an inhibitor of tumor cell invasion, possibly through the regulation of the ERK signaling pathway.""","""['Jinsong Zhang', 'Jiansong Wang', 'Ting Luan', 'Yigang Zuo', 'Jian Chen', 'Heng Zhang', 'Zhenni Ye', 'Haifeng Wang', 'Bing Hai']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Oncol Rep""","""['Dysregulation of INF2-mediated mitochondrial fission in SPOP-mutated prostate cancer.', 'SIRT4 inhibits malignancy progression of NSCLCs, through mitochondrial dynamics mediated by the ERK-Drp1 pathway.', 'Deubiquitinase ubiquitin-specific protease 9X regulates the stability and function of E3 ubiquitin ligase ring finger protein 115 in breast cancer cells.', 'HMGB1 promotes ERK-mediated mitochondrial Drp1 phosphorylation for chemoresistance through RAGE in colorectal cancer.', 'Hydrogen sulfide inhibits mitochondrial fission in neuroblastoma N2a cells through the Drp1/ERK1/2 signaling pathway.', 'Ubiquitin specific peptidases and prostate cancer.', 'Mitochondria, mitophagy, and the role of deubiquitinases as novel therapeutic targets in liver pathology.', 'Deubiquitinases in Cancers: Aspects of Proliferation, Metastasis, and Apoptosis.', 'Deubiquitination in prostate cancer progression: role of USP22.', 'Crosstalk between Drp1 phosphorylation sites during mitochondrial remodeling and their impact on metabolic adaptation.']"""

However, sipuleucel-T may not be available to some patients because of logistics, cost, and practice structure.  Objective:   To identify factors associated with the adoption of sipuleucel-T across the United States.  Design, setting, and participants:   In this retrospective cohort study, patients with prostate cancer who received therapy for mCRPC (docetaxel, abiraterone acetate, enzalutamide, cabazitaxel, radium 223, or sipuleucel-T) from January 1, 2010, through June 30, 2016, were identified in a large claims database of commercially insured patients. Patients who received sipuleucel-T were compared with patients who received any of the other treatments for mCRPC but did not receive sipuleucel-T. Data were analyzed from May 3, 2018, to February 24, 2019.  Exposures:   Sipuleucel-T treatment.  Main outcomes and measures:   Patterns of treatment that involved the use of sipuleucel-T were elucidated, and binomial logistic regression was conducted to determine patient and physician factors that were associated with the use of sipuleucel-T and whether patients received sipuleucel-T in isolation or concurrently with other therapies.  Results:   Among 7272 patients who received a treatment for mCRPC, 730 (10.0%) received sipuleucel-T. Mean (SD) age of patients in the entire cohort was 73.2 (9.2) years; 6739 (92.7%) were non-Hispanic and 975 (13.4%) were black. In multivariable analysis, patients who were Hispanic (odds ratio [OR], 0.57; 95% CI, 0.38-0.86) or lived in the Pacific region (OR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.45-0.97) had lower odds of receiving sipuleucel-T than patients who were not Hispanic or who lived in the South Atlantic region. Patients with higher incomes had greater odds of receiving sipuleucel-T than patients with incomes of less than $50 000 (OR, 1.29 [95% CI, 1.04-1.61] for $50 000-$99 000; OR, 1.43 [95% CI, 1.10-1.85] for >$99 000). Patients treated by a urologist had greater odds of receiving sipuleucel-T than patients not treated by a urologist (OR, 8.89; 95% CI, 7.10-11.11). Sixty-seven patients received concurrent therapies with sipuleucel-T, most commonly abiraterone or enzalutamide, but no factors were independently associated with patients receiving sipuleucel-T concurrent with other therapies for mCRPC.  Conclusions and relevance:   In this study, 1 of 10 patients with prostate cancer who were treated for mCRPC received sipuleucel-T, with several variables associated with its use.

Methods:   The study population consisted of 3576 consecutive patients who underwent laparoscopic radical prostatectomy and 2619 men treated with robotic radical prostatectomy in the past 15 years at Institute Mutualiste Montsouris, Paris, France. Biochemical recurrence was defined as serum prostate-specific antigen ≥0.2 ng/dL. Univariable and multivariable survival analyses were carried out to identify the prognostic factors for overall free-of-biochemical recurrence probability and conditional survival with respect to the years from surgery without recurrence. A detailed nomogram for the static and dynamic prognosis of biochemical recurrence was developed and internally validated.  Results:   The median follow-up period was 8.49 years (interquartile range 4.01-12.97), and 1148 (19%) patients experienced biochemical recurrence. Significant variables associated with biochemical recurrence in the multivariable model included preoperative prostate-specific antigen, positive surgical margins, extracapsular extension, pathological Gleason ≥4 + 3 and laparoscopic surgery (all P < 0.001). Conditional survival probability decreased with increasing time without biochemical recurrence from surgery. When stratified by prognosis factors, the 5- and 10-year conditional survival improved in all cases, especially in men with worse prognosis factors. The concordance index of the nomogram was 0.705.  Conclusions:   Conditional survival provides relevant information on how prognosis evolves over time. The risk of recurrence decreases with increasing number of years without disease.

Quantification of PSMA radiotracer uptake is desired as it enables reliable interpretation of PET images, use of PSMA uptake as an imaging biomarker for tumor characterization, and evaluation of treatment effects. The aim of this study was to perform a full pharmacokinetic analysis of 2-(3-(1-carboxy-5-[(6-18F-fluoro-pyridine-3-carbonyl)-amino]-pentyl)-ureido)-pentanedioic acid (18F-DCFPyL), a second-generation 18F-labeled PSMA ligand. On the basis of the pharmacokinetic analysis (reference method), simplified methods for quantification of 18F-DCFPyL uptake were validated. Methods: Eight patients with metastasized PCa were included. Dynamic PET acquisitions were performed at 0-60 and 90-120 min after injection of a median dose of 313 MBq of 18F-DCFPyL (range, 292-314 MBq). Continuous and manual arterial blood sampling provided calibrated plasma tracer input functions. Time-activity curves were derived for each PCa metastasis, and 18F-DCFPyL kinetics were described using standard plasma input tissue-compartment models. Simplified methods for quantification of 18F-DCFPyL uptake (SUVs; tumor-to-blood ratios [TBRs]) were correlated with kinetic parameter estimates obtained from full pharmacokinetic analysis. Results: In total, 46 metastases were evaluated. A reversible 2-tissue-compartment model was preferred for 18F-DCFPyL kinetics in 59% of the metastases. The observed k4 was small, however, resulting in nearly irreversible kinetics during the course of the PET study. Hence, k4 was fixated (0.015) and net influx rate, Ki, was preferred as the reference kinetic parameter. Whole-blood TBR provided an excellent correlation with Ki from full kinetic analysis (R2 = 0.97). This TBR could be simplified further by replacing the blood samples with an image-based, single measurement of blood activity in the ascending aorta (image-based TBR, R2 = 0.96). SUV correlated poorly with Ki (R2 = 0.47 and R2 = 0.60 for SUV normalized to body weight and lean body mass, respectively), most likely because of deviant blood activity concentrations (i.e., tumor tracer input) in patients with higher tumor volumes. Conclusion:18F-DCFPyL kinetics in PCa metastases are best described by a reversible 2-tissue-compartment model. Image-based TBRs were validated as a simplified method to quantify 18F-DCFPyL uptake and might be applied to clinical, whole-body PET scans.

Methods:   Prior to RARP, men received 6 months of enzalutamide and goserelin. mpMRI consisting of T2 weighted, b = 2,000 diffusion weighted imaging, apparent diffusion coefficient mapping, and dynamic contrast enhancement sequences was acquired before and after neoadjuvant therapy. Custom MRI-based prostate molds were printed to directly compare mpMRI findings to H&E whole-mount pathology as part of a phase II clinical trial (NCT02430480).  Results:   Twenty men underwent imaging and RARP after a regimen of AA-ADT. Positive predictive values for post-AA-ADT mpMRI diagnosis of extraprostatic extension, seminal vesicle invasion, organ-confined disease, and biopsy-confirmed PCa lesions were 71%, 80%, 80%, and 85%, respectively. Post-treatment mpMRI correctly staged disease in 15/20 (75%) cases with 17/20 (85%) correctly identified as organ-confined or not.

We assessed the dosimetric error due to inaccurate HU estimation in volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) planning.  Methods:   Based on the VMIs at 50 keV (VMI50keV), 77 keV (VMI77keV) and single-energy CT (SECT) image for a phantom with different sizes, lookup tables (LUTL and LUTS) were created. Using an anthropomorphic phantom (head and spine regions), VMAT plans were generated based on VMI50keV, VMI77keV and SECT using the corresponding LUTL, and then, the doses were re-calculated using LUTS. For clinical cases, 30 VMAT plans (prostate, brain, and spine cases) were generated based on VMI50keV and VMI77keV.  Results:   In the anthropomorphic phantom study, the difference in the dosimetric parameters for planning target volume (PTV) in the VMAT plan based on the VMI77keV was smallest (within 0.1 Gy) among three types of treatment planning approach. In clinical cases, in general, the differences of the 3-dimensional gamma passing rate and dosimetric parameters in the treatment plans based on the VMI50keV were larger than those in the VMI77keV. Especially for brain cases, the difference for PTV was more prominent when AXB was used (the maximum difference was 0.5 Gy) than AAA.  Conclusions:   The dosimetric error due to the inaccurate HU estimation was larger in the VMIs at low energy levels.

Methods:   In vivo dosimetry was performed during 20 HDR prostate cancer treatments using a point detector based on a radio-luminescence crystal (Al2O3:C) coupled to a fiber-optic cable. The dose rate was recorded at either 10 Hz or 20 Hz during the treatments. The ""time of transit"" when the source moved between two dwell positions was identified using the difference in count rate between two measurements. The dwell times were then determined by subtracting two adjacent times of transit. The measured dwell times were matched with the planned dwell times and categorised into two groups: Dwell times matching a single dwell position (identified) and dwell times matching the sum of multiple dwell positions (unidentified). Deviations between measured and planned dwell times were calculated for the identified dwell positions.  Results:   A total of 3518 dwell positions were analysed. The amount of identified dwell positions were 82%, which increased to 89% if the short dwell times (<1 s) were omitted in the analysis. The largest deviation was -0.4 s seen for a single dwell position, and in 97.1% of the cases, the deviations were <0.15 s.  Conclusion:   The dwell times in BT are well controlled by the afterloader. It is shown that IVD facilitates the detection of dwell time offsets that could have a clinical impact.""","""['J G Johansen', 'G Kertzscher', 'E B Jørgensen', 'S Rylander', 'L Bentzen', 'S B Hokland', 'C S Søndergaard', 'A K M With', 'S Buus', 'K Tanderup']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Phys Med""","""['Accuracy of an in vivo dosimetry-based source tracking method for afterloading brachytherapy - A phantom study.', 'Time-resolved in\xa0vivo dosimetry for source tracking in brachytherapy.', 'Characterization of a miniaturized scintillator detector for time-resolved treatment monitoring in HDR-brachytherapy.', 'High dose rate brachytherapy in the treatment of prostate cancer.', 'In vivo dosimetry in brachytherapy.', 'In Vivo Verification of Treatment Source Dwell Times in Brachytherapy of Postoperative Endometrial Carcinoma: A Feasibility Study.', 'In vivo dosimetry in brachytherapy: Requirements and future directions for research, development, and clinical practice.', 'Advances on inorganic scintillator-based optic fiber dosimeters.']"""

There is growing evidence of socioeconomic disparities in health outcomes among children with CKD. Patient navigators are trained non-medical personnel who assist patients with chronic conditions journey through the continuum of care and transit across different care settings. They help vulnerable and underserved populations to better understand their diagnosis, treatment options, and available resources, guide them through complex medical systems, and help them to overcome barriers to health care access. Given the complexity and chronicity of the disease process and concerns that current models of care may not adequately support the provision of high-level care in children with CKD from socioeconomically disadvantaged backgrounds, a patient navigator program may improve the provision of care and overall health of children with CKD.  Methods:   The NAV-KIDS2 trial is a multi-centre, staggered entry, waitlisted randomised controlled trial assessing the health benefits and costs of a patient navigator program in children with CKD (stages 3-5, on dialysis, and with kidney transplants), who are of low socioeconomic backgrounds. Across 5 sites, 210 patients aged from 3 to 17 years will be randomised to immediate receipt of a patient navigator intervention for 24 weeks or waitlisting with standard care until receipt of a patient navigator at 24 weeks. The primary outcome is child self-rated health (SRH) 6-months after completion of the intervention. Other outcomes include utility-based quality of life, caregiver SRH, satisfaction with healthcare, progression of kidney dysfunction, other biomarkers, missed school days, hospitalisations and mortality. The trial also includes an economic evaluation and process evaluation, which will assess the cost-effectiveness, fidelity and barriers and enablers of implementing a patient navigator program in this setting.  Discussion:   This study will provide clear evidence on the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a new intervention aiming to improve overall health and well-being for children with CKD from socioeconomically disadvantaged backgrounds, through a high quality, well-powered clinical trial.

These proteins included the nuclear exportin proteins XPO1 (also known as CRM1), the EV-associated PDCD6IP (also known as ALIX), and the previously published fatty acid synthase FASN. In this study, we investigated differences in expression of XPO1 and PDCD6IP on well-characterized prostate cancer cohorts using mass spectrometry and tissue microarray (TMA) immunohistochemistry to determine their diagnostic and prognostic value.  Methods:   Protein fractions from 67 tissue samples (n = 33 normal adjacent prostate [NAP] and n = 34 PCa) were analyzed by mass spectrometry (nano-LC-MS-MS). Label-free quantification of EVs was performed to identify differentially expressed proteins between PCa and NAP. Prognostic evaluation of the candidate markers was performed with a TMA, containing 481 radical prostatectomy samples. Samples were stained for the candidate markers and correlated with patient information and clinicopathological outcome.  Results:   XPO1 was higher expressed in PCa compared to NAP in the MS data analysis (P > 0.0001). PDCD6IP was not significantly higher expressed (P = 0.0501).

The tumor immune microenvironment and secreted cytokines play a substantial role in development of resistance to chemotherapy. Our previous study has demonstrated that CD4+ T cells in prostate tumor microenvironment contribute to PCa progression; meanwhile, we found increased CD4+ T-cell infiltration in tumor area after Doc treatment; however, their effects on PCa chemosensitivity remain unclear. Here, we aim to explore the role and mechanisms of CD4+ T cells in PCa chemotherapy sensitivity.  Methods:   CD4+ T-cell infiltration in Doc-treated paraffin-embedded specimens from transurethral resection of prostate, radical prostatectomy, or bone metastasis was detected by immunohistochemistry. The castration-resistant PCa cell lines-C4-2 and CWR22RV1, and CD4+ T-cell lines-HH and Molt-3 were used in the coculture system. After coculture with the lymphocytes, PCa cell chemosensitivity was detected by cell counting kit-8, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick-end labeling assays, and Western blot analysis. Various cell cytokines were determined by cytokine arrays and reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction. The recombinant human C-C motif chemokine ligand 5 (CCL5) was added to PCa cells for further confirming its effects and anti-CCL5 antibody was used for neutralization. S3I-201, a signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) inhibitor, was added to the coculture system to detect STAT3 role in chemosensitivity. Tumor xenografts in nude mice were used for confirming effects of CD4+ T cells in vivo study.  Results:   We found more infiltrated CD4+ T cells in human PCa lesions than in the adjacent noncancerous tissues after Doc treatment. In vitro cell line study confirmed that CD4+ T cells increase the PCa Doc resistance. Quantative polymerase chain reaction and cytokine arrays indicated that after coculture with PCa, CD4+ T cells could secrete large amounts of CCL5. Moreover, CCL5 stimulation enhanced PCa resistance to Doc, and anti-CCL5 antibody could partly reverse this process. We found that CD4+ T cells could activate P-STAT3 signaling via secreting CCL5 and adding a STAT3 inhibitor can reverse the chemoresistance. In vivo mouse model with xenografted 22RV1 cells and CD4+ T cells also confirmed the in vitro results.  Conclusions:   Together, our results indicate that infiltrating CD4+ T cells could promote PCa chemotherapy resistance via modulation of the CCL5/STAT3 signaling pathway.""","""['Peng Xiang', 'Song Jin', 'Yang Yang', 'Jindong Sheng', 'Qun He', 'Yi Song', 'Wei Yu', 'Shuai Hu', 'Jie Jin']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Acetyl-11-keto-β-boswellic acid suppresses docetaxel-resistant prostate cancer cells in vitro and in vivo by blocking Akt and Stat3 signaling, thus suppressing chemoresistant stem cell-like properties.', 'Cancer-cell-secreted CXCL11 promoted CD8+ T cells infiltration through docetaxel-induced-release of HMGB1 in NSCLC.', 'Gastric cancer cells exploit CD4+ cell-derived CCL5 for their growth and prevention of CD8+ cell-involved tumor elimination.', 'Research Trends and Regulation of CCL5 in Prostate Cancer.', 'STAT3 signaling in prostate cancer progression and therapy resistance: An oncogenic pathway with diverse functions.', 'In vitro models of breast cancer bone metastasis: analyzing drug resistance through the lens of the microenvironment.', 'Impact of Immune Cells in the Tumor Microenvironment of Prostate Cancer Metastasis.', 'A Novel Four Mitochondrial Respiration-Related Signature for Predicting Biochemical Recurrence of Prostate Cancer.', 'Cuproptosis-related gene FDX1 expression correlates with the prognosis and tumor immune microenvironment in clear cell renal cell carcinoma.', 'FECH Expression Correlates with the Prognosis and Tumor Immune Microenvironment in Clear Cell Renal Cell Carcinoma.']"""

In this study, we tested if substrates for de novo steroidogenesis accumulating during CYP17A1 inhibition may drive cell growth in relevant preclinical models.  Methods:   PCa cell lines and their respective CRPC sublines were used to model CRPC in vitro. Precursor steroids pregnenolone (Preg) and progesterone (Prog) served as substrate for de novo steroid synthesis. TAK700 (orteronel), abiraterone, and small interfering RNA (siRNA) against CYP17A1 were used to block CYP17A1 enzyme activity. The antiandrogen RD162 was used to assess androgen receptor (AR) involvement. Cell growth was measured by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay. AR-target gene expression was quantified by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Nuclear import studies using cells with green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged AR were performed to assess the potential of precursor steroids to directly activate AR.  Results:   Preg and Prog stimulated cell proliferation and AR target gene expression in VCaP, DuCaP, LNCaP, and their respective CRPC sublines. The antiandrogen RD162, but not CYP17A1 inhibition with TAK700, abiraterone or siRNA, was able to block Preg- and Prog-induced proliferation. In contrast to TAK700, abiraterone also affected dihydrotestosterone-induced cell growth, indicating direct AR binding. Furthermore, Prog-induced AR translocation was not affected by treatment with TAK700 or abiraterone, while it was effectively blocked by the AR antagonist enzalutamide, further demonstrating the direct AR activation by Prog.  Conclusion:   Activation of the AR by clinically relevant levels of Preg and Prog accumulating in abiraterone-treated patients may act as a driver for CRPC.

Sensitive detection and specific capture methods are essential for exosomes analysis. Herein, a dual functional platform composed of superparamagnetic conjunctions and molecular beacons (SMC-MB) is reported. The SMC-MB platform is designed based on aptamer immunoaffinity with ultrasensitive detection efficiency and reversible isolation capacity, which, respectively, profit from nonenzymatic amplification methods and magnetic separation along with restriction cleavage. It is noteworthy that exosomes quantification was exactly amplified and transformed into single strand DNA detection. Correlated measurements evidence that the limit of detection of SMC-MB is as low as ∼100 particles/μL in urine, and a linear relationship meets between the logarithmic concentration of exosomes and fluorescence intensity of the molecular beacon. Furthermore, employing prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA) aptamer, the platform adapted to detect and capture PMSA-positive exosomes from urine samples provides excellent diagnostic efficiency for prostate cancer (PCa). The expression of typical biomarkers of PCa, i.e., PSA and PCA3 mRNA, is significantly higher in PSMA-positive exosomes. Altogether, the platform and strategy described in this paper are promising in urinary exosomes analysis and prostate cancer detection.""","""['Ping Li', 'Xiyuan Yu', 'Wujuan Han', 'Ying Kong', 'Weiyang Bao', 'Jiaqi Zhang', 'Wancun Zhang', 'Yueqing Gu']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""ACS Sens""","""['Prostate cancer biomarker profiles in urinary sediments and exosomes.', 'Tumor-Derived Exosomal Long Noncoding RNAs as Promising Diagnostic Biomarkers for Prostate Cancer.', 'Rapid and specific detection nanoplatform of serum exosomes for prostate cancer diagnosis.', 'Urinary biomarkers of prostate cancer.', 'Prostate Cancer Detection and Prognosis: From Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) to Exosomal Biomarkers.', 'Diagnosis of Prostate Cancer through the Multi-Ligand Binding of Prostate-Derived Extracellular Vesicles and miRNA Analysis.', 'Room-Temperature Self-Healing Conductive Elastomers for Modular Assembly as a Microfluidic Electrochemical Biosensing Platform for the Detection of Colorectal Cancer Exosomes.', 'Nucleic acid and nanomaterial-assisted signal-amplified strategies in fluorescent analysis of circulating tumor cells and small extracellular vesicles.', 'Urine-derived exosomal PSMA is a promising diagnostic biomarker for the detection of prostate cancer on initial biopsy.', 'Small extracellular vesicles as a multicomponent biomarker platform in urinary tract carcinomas.']"""

Objective:   To compare cholesterol metabolism on individual paired normal and tumour prostate tissues obtained from patients with PCa.  Design, setting, and participants:   Between 2008 and 2012, normal and tumour paired tissue samples were collected from radical prostatectomy specimens from a cohort of 69 patients treated for localised PCa.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Tumour and normal tissues were subjected to gene analysis, sterol measurement, and immunohistochemistry. The Wilcoxon paired test and Spearman test were applied for comparison and correlation analyses, respectively. Principal component analysis was also carried out to investigate relationships between quantitative variables.  Results and limitations:   Overall, cholesterol concentrations were not significantly different between tissue pairs. However, tumour samples were significantly associated with downregulated de novo cholesterol synthesis, but exhibited 54.7% overexpression of SCARB1 that could increase high-density lipoprotein uptake in PCa. Tumour tissues showed different trafficking of available cholesterol, with significantly lower ACAT1, and an altered efflux via APOE. Furthermore, cholesterol metabolism in tumour tissues was characterised by higher accumulation of 7α-hydroxycholesterol (OHC), 7βOHC, and 7-ketosterol, and a lower level of 27OHC.  Conclusions:   Focusing on individually paired prostate tissues, our results highlighted several differences between normal and tumour samples linked to a metabolic shift in cholesterol flux. PCa samples exhibited a specific tissue signature characterised by higher SCARB1 expression, higher accumulation of OHC species, and clear downregulation of de novo cholesterol synthesis.  Patient summary:   Comparing normal and tumour tissues from the same prostates, our study identified a set of alterations in prostate cancer samples in terms of their use of cholesterol. These included higher cholesterol uptake, accumulation of oxidised cholesterol derivatives, and autonomous cellular production of cholesterol.

Thus, we performed a national survey of radiation oncologists (ROs) and urologists (UROs) to elicit attitudes and AS recommendations for intermediate-risk PCa.  Objective:   To determine whether AS for PCa is becoming readily accepted by PCa specialists in the USA.  Design, setting, and participants:   From January to July 2017, we conducted a national survey of 915 ROs and 940 UROs on perceptions of AS and its use among patients with intermediate-risk PCa.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Perceived effectiveness and comfort with AS and recommendation of AS from case presentations represented the primary outcomes. Pearson chi-square and multivariable logistic regression analyses were used to identify physician characteristics associated with primary outcomes.  Results and limitations:   Overall, the response rate was 37.3% (n=692) and was similar for ROs and UROs (35.7% vs 38.7%; p=0.18). For intermediate-risk PCa, both UROs and ROs expressed limited favorable views that AS is effective (39.8% vs 33.0%; p=0.06) and felt comfortable recommending it (37.6% vs 25.9%; p=0.001). From clinical scenarios, both specialties infrequently recommended AS for a healthy patient diagnosed with intermediate-risk PCa. For a healthy 55-yr-old patient with PSA of 8ng/ml and Gleason 3+4 PCa, few ROs and UROs recommended AS (2.8% vs 4.3%; adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 0.42; p=0.12). AS was more likely to be recommended equally by ROs and UROs for a healthy 75-yr-old with the same clinicopathologic characteristics (29.0% vs 35.4%; AOR 0.68; p=0.09). Limitations include a modest response rate for our survey.  Conclusions:   Our national survey revealed that many ROs and UROs do not believe that AS is effective or feel comfortable recommending it or selecting it as an option for younger patients with intermediate-risk PCa.  Patient summary:   We performed a national survey of radiation oncologists and urologists to assess attitudes regarding active surveillance (AS) and its use among patients with intermediate-risk prostate cancer. Our study demonstrates that radiation oncologists and urologists are not yet comfortable with recommending AS and rarely endorse its use for younger patients.""","""['Simon P Kim', 'Nilay D Shah', 'Neal J Meropol', 'Jon C Tilburt', 'Paul L Nguyen', 'James B Yu', 'Robert Abouassaly', 'Albert Kim', 'Cary P Gross']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Eur Urol Oncol""","""['A National Survey of Radiation Oncologists and Urologists on Perceived Attitudes and Recommendations of Active Surveillance for Low-Risk Prostate Cancer.', 'Perceptions of Prostate MRI and Fusion Biopsy of Radiation Oncologists and Urologists for Patients Diagnosed with Prostate Cancer: Results from a National Survey.', 'Perceptions of Barriers Towards Active Surveillance for Low-Risk Prostate Cancer: Results From a National Survey of Radiation Oncologists and Urologists.', 'The role of androgen ablation in patients with biochemical or local failure after definitive radiation therapy: a survey of practice patterns of urologists and radiation oncologists in the United States.', 'Variability in Outcomes for Patients with Intermediate-risk Prostate Cancer (Gleason Score 7, International Society of Urological Pathology Gleason Group 2-3) and Implications for Risk Stratification: A Systematic Review.', 'Active Surveillance in Prostate Cancer: Role of Available Biomarkers in Daily Practice.']"""

Objective:   To evaluate positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) using the radiolabeled GRPR antagonist probe BAY86-7548 (68Ga-RM2) for localization of newly diagnosed PCa in comparison with multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI), histopathology, and immunohistochemistry (IHC).  Design, setting, and participants:   This was a prospective study of 16 men with biopsy-proven PCa (2 low, 8 intermediate, and 6 high risk). 68Ga-RM2 PET/CT was performed within 4 wk after mpMRI and within 2 wk before radical prostatectomy and extended bilateral pelvic lymph node dissection.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   The presence of cancer was evaluated by blinded specialists using a 5-point Likert scale, with lesions scoring 4 or 5 considered positive, on 68Ga-RM2 PET/CT, mpMRI, and 68Ga-RM2 PET/CT-mpMRI fused images for each of 12 anatomic areas of the prostate. Whole-mount, step-section pathology served as the reference standard. Expression of GRPR and prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) was analyzed via IHC of tumor paraffin sections.  Results and limitations:   Of 192 areas analyzed, 128 contained cancer. The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of 68Ga-RM2 PET/CT imaging and mpMRI did not differ significantly; fusing the images maximized the sensitivity and accuracy (85.2% and 83.9%, respectively) and averaged the specificity (81.3%). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.76 for PET visual analysis, 0.72 for PET quantitative analysis, 0.76 for mpMRI, and 0.85 for combined PET/CT and mpMRI analysis. 68Ga-RM2 uptake did not correlate with Gleason score. IHC analysis revealed weaker staining for GRPR than for PSMA, and the expression of these markers was not correlated (r=0.3882). The major limitation is the small sample size.  Conclusions: 68Ga-RM2 PET/CT is promising for detection and localization of primary PCa, and complements mpMRI. GRPR expression appears to be independent from PSMA expression, suggesting that GRPR- and PSMA-targeted PET imaging may be complementary.

However, learning curves for attaining accuracy may limit the generalizability of published outcomes.  Objective:   To delineate and quantify the learning curve for FBx by assessing the targeted biopsy accuracy and pathological quality of systematic biopsy over time.  Design, setting, and participants:   We carried out a retrospective analysis of 173 consecutive men who underwent Artemis FBx with computer-template systematic sampling between July 2015 and May 2017.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   The accuracy of targeted biopsy was determined by calculating the distance between planned and actual core trajectories stored on Artemis. Systematic sampling proficiency was assessed via pathological analysis of fibromuscular tissue in all cores and then comparing pathology elements from individual cores from men in the first and last tertiles. Polynomial linear regression models, change-point analysis, and piecewise linear regression were used to quantify the learning curve.  Results and limitation:   A significant improvement in targeted biopsy accuracy occurred up to 98 cases (p<0.01). There was a significant decrease in fibromuscular tissue in the systematic biopsy cores up to 84 cases (p<0.01) and an improvement in pathological quality when comparing systematic cores from the first and third tertiles. Use of a different fusion platform may limit the generalizability of our results.  Conclusions:   There is a significant learning curve for targeted and systemic biopsy using the Artemis platform. Improvements in accuracy of targeted biopsy and better sampling for systematic biopsy can be achieved with greater experience.  Patient summary:   We define the learning curve for magnetic resonance imaging/ultrasound-guided fusion biopsy (FBx) using targeted biopsy accuracy and systematic core sampling quality as measures. Our findings underscore the importance of overcoming learning curves inherent to FBx to minimize patient discomfort and biopsy risk and improve the quality of care for accurate risk stratification, active surveillance, and treatment selection.""","""['Khushabu Kasabwala', 'Neal Patel', 'Eliza Cricco-Lizza', 'Adrian A Shimpi', 'Stanley Weng', 'Rose M Buchmann', 'Samaneh Motanagh', 'Yiyuan Wu', 'Samprit Banerjee', 'Francesca Khani', 'Daniel J Margolis', 'Brian D Robinson', 'Jim C Hu']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Eur Urol Oncol""","""['The Role of Systematic and Targeted Biopsies in Light of Overlap on Magnetic Resonance Imaging Ultrasound Fusion Biopsy.', 'Optimizing the Number of Cores Targeted During Prostate Magnetic Resonance Imaging Fusion Target Biopsy.', 'The Institutional Learning Curve of Magnetic Resonance Imaging-Ultrasound Fusion Targeted Prostate Biopsy: Temporal Improvements in Cancer Detection in 4 Years.', 'Prostate Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Magnetic Resonance Imaging Targeted Biopsy in Patients with a Prior Negative Biopsy: A Consensus Statement by AUA and SAR.', 'Magnetic resonance imaging-transrectal ultrasound fusion image-guided prostate biopsy: Current status of the cancer detection and the prospects of tailor-made medicine of the prostate cancer.', 'Role of targeted biopsy, perilesional biopsy, and random biopsy in prostate cancer diagnosis by mpMRI/transrectal ultrasonography fusion biopsy.', 'Learning Curve of Transperineal MRI/US Fusion Prostate Biopsy: 4-Year Experience.', 'Systematic or targeted fusion-guided biopsy.', 'Extracapsular extension of transitional zone prostate cancer miss-detected by multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging.', 'Adverse Pathology after Radical Prostatectomy of Patients Eligible for Active Surveillance-A Summary 7 Years after Introducing mpMRI-Guided Biopsy in a Real-World Setting.']"""

Objective:   To investigate the association between regular aspirin use and lethal PC.  Design, setting, and participants:   Participants were aged 40-75 yr at baseline in 1986 and have been followed with biennial questionnaires. The risk analysis includes 49 409 men. The survival analysis includes 5980 PC patients without metastatic disease at diagnosis.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   We used Cox proportional hazards regression to examine the association between current, past, or never regular aspirin use (≥2 d/wk) in relation to lethal (metastatic or fatal) PC. We also examined years of use among current users and years since stopping among past users. In the risk analysis, aspirin was updated throughout follow-up. In the survival analysis, aspirin use after diagnosis was assessed.  Results and limitations:   Some 29% of participants used aspirin regularly at baseline, which increased to 60% by 2010. In the risk analysis, 804 men were diagnosed with lethal PC. Current regular aspirin was associated with a lower risk of lethal prostate cancer (hazard ratio [HR] 0.80, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.66-0.96) compared to never users. In the survival analysis, 451 of the men diagnosed with nonmetastatic PC later developed lethal disease. Current postdiagnostic aspirin was associated with a lower risk of lethal PC (HR 0.80, 95% CI 0.64-1.00) and overall mortality (HR 0.79, 95% CI 0.69-0.90). When restricted to highly screened men, the risk analysis associations were stronger and survival analysis associations remained statistically significant. Reverse causation and residual confounding remain concerns, as demonstrated by the attenuated results in sensitivity analyses.  Conclusions:   Regular aspirin use was associated with a lower risk of lethal PC. Postdiagnostic use was associated with better survival after diagnosis.

The lack of data about the toxicity profiles of lesion-targeting therapies, however, has made it difficult to compare treatment modalities. The aim of the present study was to evaluate comprehensively the incidence, severity, and timing of onset of complications for PCa patients undergoing focal high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) and focal cryosurgical ablation of the prostate (CSAP). Materials and Methods: A total of 336 patients were included who underwent focal HIFU or focal CSAP as a primary treatment for PCa between January 2009 and December 2017. Mean follow-up was 11 months (standard deviation: 3.0). All complications were captured and graded according to severity, and classified by timing of onset. Univariate and multivariate analysis was performed to identify predictors of the most common side effects. Results: There were 98 complications in 79/210 patients (38%) undergoing focal HIFU and 34 complications in 27/126 patients (21%) undergoing focal CSAP. In terms of severity, 95% of the complications of focal HIFU and 91% of the complications of focal CSAP were minor. Most complications presented in the early postoperative period. On multivariate analysis, subtotal HIFU was associated with acute urinary retention (AUR), while a smaller prostate size and longer catheterization time with dysuria. In CSAP patients, longer catheterization time was associated with AUR and urethral sloughing. The main limitation is the nonrandomized and retrospective nature.

Few studies have assessed the effects of treatment on GBM's sexual behavior. For an online survey, 193 gay and bisexual men with prostate cancer were recruited from the North American's largest online cancer support group. Sexual functioning was measured using the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC) and a tailored Gay Sexual Functioning Inventory (GSFI). GBM have worse EPIC urinary and hormonal function and worse hormonal bother, but better sexual function and bother scores than published norms. In the GSFI, two-thirds of participants described their sexual functioning, post-treatment, as fair to poor. Only 22% reported erections sufficient for insertive anal sex. For receptive anal sex, one-third met criteria for anodyspareunia. Over half reported urination problems during sex or at orgasm. Erectile difficulties were common, severe, and a reason cited for not using condoms. Three men HIV seroconverted post-prostate cancer treatment. Differences in function and bother scores were observed by type of treatment, age, race/ethnicity, sexual orientation, but not relationship status. Sexual functioning significantly predicted long-term mental and physical health. GBM scored significantly worse on mental health and better on physical health than published norms. Sexual recovery after prostate cancer treatment is problematic for most GBM. Research to develop more effective sexual recovery, tailored to the needs of GBM treated for prostate cancer, is needed.

We have investigated ETV1, ETV4, and ETV5 overexpression, with or without PTEN loss, and their association with grade group (GG), pathological stage, focality, and PSA recurrence in PrCa. ETS gene expression was analyzed by qPCR in 104 cases. ETV1 and PTEN immunohistochemistry was assessed in TMA sections from 194 additional cases (PSMAR-Biobank, Barcelona, Spain). ETS mRNA overexpression was found in 23.1%, being ETV1 the most frequently overexpressed (18.3%). ETV1 protein overexpression was detected in 30.4% cases (moderate in 19.6%, strong in 10.8%). PTEN protein expression loss was detected in 36.1% cases and was not associated with ETV1. Strong-moderate ETV1 protein overexpression reaches its highest values in GG3-4, whereas its negativity was significantly more common in GG1 tumors (p = 0.034). ETV1-overexpressing tumors were more often unifocal (p = 0.0007) and high stage (p = 0.032). PTEN loss was less common in GG1 (p = 0.012) and showed a trend to be less frequent in pT2 (p = 0.062) tumors. Strong ETV1 immunostaining (histoscore > 177) was associated with shorter time to PSA recurrence in the univariate (p = 0.002) and in the multivariate analysis (p = 0.018). Moreover, when strong ETV1 overexpression was not combined with PTEN loss, its association with PSA recurrence was even stronger (p = 0.0004). In conclusion, non-ERG ETS overexpression, particularly ETV1 overexpression, has a non-negligible role in PrCa. Strong ETV1 protein expression has a negative impact on prostate cancer outcome that seems to be independent of PTEN status.""","""['Laura Segalés', 'Nuria Juanpere', 'Marta Lorenzo', 'Raquel Albero-González', 'Lluís Fumadó', 'Lluís Cecchini', 'Joaquim Bellmunt', 'Josep Lloreta-Trull', 'Silvia Hernández-Llodrà']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Virchows Arch""","""['Function and regulation of the PEA3 subfamily of ETS transcription factors in cancer.', 'Immunohistochemical expression of mismatch repair proteins (MSH2, MSH6, MLH1, and PMS2) in prostate cancer: correlation with grade groups (WHO 2016) and ERG and PTEN status.', 'Specific and redundant activities of ETV1 and ETV4 in prostate cancer aggressiveness revealed by co-overexpression cellular contexts.', 'Clonal evaluation of early onset prostate cancer by expression profiling of ERG, SPINK1, ETV1, and ETV4 on whole-mount radical prostatectomy tissue.', 'The utility of ETV1, ETV4 and ETV5 RNA in-situ hybridization in the diagnosis of CIC-DUX sarcomas.', 'HGF-mediated elevation of ETV1 facilitates hepatocellular carcinoma metastasis through upregulating PTK2 and c-MET.', 'Biological and prognostic value of ETV5 in high-grade serous ovarian cancer.', 'Function and regulation of the PEA3 subfamily of ETS transcription factors in cancer.']"""

This is an individual case-report which only looks at one concrete fixing system with an adhesive plate (StatLock®).In an internet search on 12/2017 the usual care-recommendation refers mainly to a document of Charité - Universitätsmedizin Berlin (04/2014). It is recommended to change the adhesive plate and the plaster every seven days. Also irrigations during the change of the adhesive plate and after each use of the PICC line are recommended. This procedure also includes the take off and new fixation of the adhesive plate as well as the disinfection and cleaning of the skin and the fixation of the plaster.This case report looked at a 65 years old masculine, cachectic, palliative patient with a metastasizing prostate cancer in a weak condition. He was able to move within his residential area. He had no cognitive or psychological impairment.The installation of the PICC line on the left upper arm was done in 04/2017. When the patient came to our mobile palliative team one of the lines was used for pain therapy with a PCA-pump. The second line was irrigated with 10 ml NaCl by his wife daily.At the beginning the adhesive plate was changed every 14 days. Because of skin irritations and pain during the change of the bandage the patient decided at the 10.8.2017 to do no more further changes of the adhesive plate.The adhesive plate was controlled through the transparent plaster and the transparent plaster was changed for the first time on the 20.10.2017 without removing the adhesive plate. The change of the adhesive plate itself was done on the 13.12.2017 without any complications.In this described case there were no complications even after more than 4 months (20 weeks) although there was no change of the adhesive plate during this time.It is suggested to individualize the interval of the change of the adhesive plate for palliative patient even more. Larger studies could give more detailed guidelines for an extend change interval. Thereby the comfort and the safety of the patient should be more important than the economic aspects (less effort and smaller costs because of the extended intervals of change).""","""['Günter Polt', 'Ingrid Bruchmann']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Wien Med Wochenschr""","""['Central venous Access device SeCurement And Dressing Effectiveness for peripherally inserted central catheters in adult acute hospital patients (CASCADE): a pilot randomised controlled trial.', 'Peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs) in cancer patients under chemotherapy: A prospective study on the incidence of complications and overall failures.', 'Association between delivery methods for red blood cell transfusion and the risk of venous thromboembolism: a longitudinal study.', 'Nurse style of central vein!

The efficacy of two different oncolytic herpes simplex viruses (oHSVs) (G47Δ and MG18L) in PCSCs was tested alone and in combination with radiation; chemotherapy; and inhibitors of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), Wnt, and NOTCH in vitro; and, G47Δ was tested with the PI3K inhibitor BKM120 in a PCSC-derived tumor model in vivo. PCSCs were more tumorigenic than serum-cultured parental cells. Human and murine PCSCs were sensitive to oHSV and BKM120 killing in vitro, while the combination was synergistic. oHSV combined with radiation, docetaxel, Wnt, or NOTCH inhibitors was not. In athymic mice bearing DU145 PCSC-derived tumors, the combination of intra-tumoral G47Δ and systemic BKM120 induced complete regression of tumors in 2 of 7 animals, and it exhibited superior anti-tumor activity compared to either monotherapy alone, with no detectable toxicity. oHSV synergizes with BKM120 in killing PCSCs in vitro, and the combination markedly inhibits tumor growth, even inducing regression in vivo.""","""['Lei Wang', 'Jianfang Ning', 'Hiroaki Wakimoto', 'Shulin Wu', 'Chin-Lee Wu', 'Melissa R Humphrey', 'Samuel D Rabkin', 'Robert L Martuza']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Mol Ther Oncolytics""","""['A novel oncolytic herpes simplex virus that synergizes with phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt pathway inhibitors to target glioblastoma stem cells.', 'Blockade of transforming growth factor-β signaling enhances oncolytic herpes simplex virus efficacy in patient-derived recurrent glioblastoma models.', 'Oncolytic herpes simplex virus vector g47delta in combination with androgen ablation for the treatment of human prostate adenocarcinoma.', 'Oncolytic virus therapy using genetically engineered herpes simplex viruses.', 'Current status of clinical trials assessing oncolytic virus therapy for urological cancers.', 'Development and application of oncolytic viruses as the nemesis of tumor cells.', 'Oncolytic virotherapy: basic principles, recent advances and future directions.', 'Anti-Cancer Stem-Cell-Targeted Therapies in Prostate Cancer.', 'Oxidative stress-triggered Wnt signaling perturbation characterizes the tipping point of lung adeno-to-squamous transdifferentiation.', 'Targeting PI3K/Akt signaling in prostate cancer therapy.']"""

OBI-3424 has entered clinical testing for hepatocellular carcinoma and castrate-resistant prostate cancer, and it represents a potentially novel treatment for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).  Experimental design:   We assessed AKR1C3 expression by RNA-Seq and immunoblotting, and evaluated the in vitro cytotoxicity of OBI-3424. We investigated the pharmacokinetics of OBI-3424 in mice and nonhuman primates, and assessed the in vivo efficacy of OBI-3424 against a large panel of patient-derived xenografts (PDX).  Results:   AKR1C3 mRNA expression was significantly higher in primary T-lineage ALL (T-ALL; n = 264) than B-lineage ALL (B-ALL; n = 1,740; P < 0.0001), and OBI-3424 exerted potent cytotoxicity against T-ALL cell lines and PDXs. In vivo, OBI-3424 significantly prolonged the event-free survival (EFS) of nine of nine ALL PDXs by 17.1-77.8 days (treated/control values 2.5-14.0), and disease regression was observed in eight of nine PDXs. A significant reduction (P < 0.0001) in bone marrow infiltration at day 28 was observed in four of six evaluable T-ALL PDXs. The importance of AKR1C3 in the in vivo response to OBI-3424 was verified using a B-ALL PDX that had been lentivirally transduced to stably overexpress AKR1C3. OBI-3424 combined with nelarabine resulted in prolongation of mouse EFS compared with each single agent alone in two T-ALL PDXs.

Three gold fiducials were implanted for image guidance. The clinical target volume (CTV) included the prostate only, and the planning target volume (PTV) was a 3 mm expansion enabled through the use of a rectal immobilization device. The dose prescribed was 26 Gy in 2 weekly fractions (EQD2 110 Gy1.4). The primary endpoint was quality of life using EPIC, and minimal clinically important change (MCIC) was defined as an EPIC QOL decrease >0.5 SD.  Results:   30 patients were accrued with a median follow-up of 49.3 months. 10% had low-risk, 33% had favourable intermediate-risk and 57% had unfavourable intermediate-risk PCa.

The purpose of this study is to define dose-volume predictors for late gastrointestinal and genitourinary (GI and GU) toxicities after HRT in the multi-center NRG Oncology/RTOG 0415 low-risk prostate cancer trial (N = 521).  Material/methods:   Treatment in the studied HRT arm was delivered as 70 Gy at 2.5 Gy/fraction with 3D-CRT/IMRT (N = 108/413). At a median follow-up of 5.9 years, the crude late ≥Grade 2 GI and GU toxicities were 19% and 29%, respectively. For modeling, the complete HRT cohort was randomly split into training and validation (70% and 30%; preserved toxicity rates). Within training, dose-response modeling was based on dose-volume cut-points (EQD2Gy; bladder/rectum: α/β = 6 Gy/3Gy), age, acute ≥Grade 2 toxicity, and treatment technique using univariate and multivariate logistic regression on bootstrapping (UVA and MVA). Candidate predictors were determined at p ≤ 0.05, and the selected MVA models were explored on validation where model generalizability was judged if the area under the receiver-operating curve in validation (AUCvalidation) was within AUCtraining ± SD with p ≤ 0.05, and with an Hosmer-Lemeshow p-value (pHL) > 0.05.  Results:   Three candidate predictors were suggested for late GI toxicity: the minimum dose to the hottest 5% rectal volume (D5%[Gy]), the absolute rectal volume <35 Gy, and acute GI toxicity (AUC = 0.59-0.63; p = 0.02-0.04). The two generalizable MVA models, i.e., D5%[Gy] with or without acute GI toxicity (AUCvalidation = 0.64, 0.65; p = 0.01, 0.03; pHL = 0.45-0.56), suggest that reducing late GI toxicity from 20% to 10% would require reducing D5%[Gy] from ≤65 Gy to ≤62 Gy (logistic function argument: 17+(0.24D5%[Gy])). Acute GU toxicity showed only a trend to predict late GU toxicity (AUCtraining = 0.57; p = 0.07).  Conclusion:   Late GI toxicity, following moderate HRT for low-risk prostate cancer, increases with higher doses to small rectal volumes. This work provides quantitative evidence that limiting small rectal dose 'hotspots' in clinical practice of such HRT regimens is likely to further reduce the associated rates of GI toxicity.""","""['Maria Thor', 'Joseph O Deasy', 'Rebecca Paulus', 'W Robert Lee', 'Mahul B Amin', 'Deborah W Bruner', 'Daniel A Low', 'Amit B Shah', 'Shawn C Malone', 'Jeff M Michalski', 'Ian S Dayes', 'Samantha A Seaward', 'Elizabeth M Gore', 'Michele Albert', 'Thomas M Pisansky', 'Sergio L Faria', 'Yuhchyau Chen', 'Bridget F Koontz', 'Gregory P Swanson', 'Stephanie L Pugh', 'Howard M Sandler']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Radiother Oncol""","""['Preliminary toxicity analysis of 3-dimensional conformal radiation therapy versus intensity modulated radiation therapy on the high-dose arm of the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group 0126 prostate cancer trial.', 'Role of principal component analysis in predicting toxicity in prostate cancer patients treated with hypofractionated intensity-modulated radiation therapy.', 'Acute and late complications after radiotherapy for prostate cancer: results of a multicenter randomized trial comparing 68 Gy to 78 Gy.', 'Intensity-modulated radiotherapy as primary treatment for prostate cancer: acute toxicity in 114 patients.', 'Genitourinary and gastrointestinal toxicity among patients with localized prostate cancer treated with conventional versus moderately hypofractionated radiation therapy: systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Dose-Volume Histogram Parameters and Quality of Life in Patients with Prostate Cancer Treated with Surgery and High-Dose Volumetric-Intensity-Modulated Arc Therapy to the Prostate Bed.', 'Radiation technique and outcomes following moderately hypofractionated treatment of low risk prostate cancer: a secondary analysis of RTOG 0415.', 'Comparative efficacy and safety of neoadjuvant radiotherapy for patients with borderline resectable, and locally advanced pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma: a systematic review and network meta-analysis protocol.', 'Role of CDK4/6 inhibitors in patients with hormone receptor (HR)-positive, human epidermal receptor-2 negative (HER-2) metastatic breast cancer study protocol for a systematic review, network meta-analysis and cost-effectiveness analysis.', 'Simulation study using the spots deletion technique in spot scanning proton beam therapy for prostate cancers.']"""

Results:   Median follow-up for the cohort was 5.2 (Inter Quartile Range: 2.9-6.6) years. Median baseline PSA was 7.3 (5.3-9.8) ng/mL. 234 (56.9%) patients had T1 and 177 (43.1%) had T2 disease. Median APP4 was 2.00 (0.75-7.50)%. 38 (9.3%) patients experienced BF. The optimal cutpoint of APP4 for BF was >3.3% with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.66. 17 (4.1%) received ADT-BF. The ADT-BF cutpoint was >6.6% with an AUC of 0.72. Eight (2.0%) developed MD. The MD cutpoint was >17.5% with an AUC of 0.86. Using APP4 >3.3 vs ≤ 3.3, log-transformed baseline PSA ln(PSA) (HR 2.5, 1.1-6.1; p = 0.037) and APP4 (HR 2.3, 1.1-4.7; p = 0.031) predicted for BF. Using APP4 >6.6 vs ≤ 6.6, ln(PSA) (HR 4.2, 1.4-12.4; p = 0.010) and APP4 (HR 3.7, 1.4-10.0; p = 0.009) were predictive of ADT-BF. APP4 >17.5 vs ≤ 17.5 alone was predictive of MD (HR 25.7, 4.9-135.3; p < 0.001).  Conclusion:   APP4 cutpoints of >3.3%, >6.6% and >17.5% were strongly associated with increased risk of BF, ADT-BF and developing MD respectively.

Materials and methods:   Between January 2012 and May 2017, 210 patients were included in a prospective protocol. Treatment consisted in HDR-BT (15 Gy single fraction) plus 3DCRT (37.5 Gy/15 fractions). Univariate and multivariate logistic regressions were used to analyse the impact of variables on late toxicity.  Results:   Median age was 71 (56-82), 12.4% of patients had low, 44.3% intermediate and 41% high-risk prostate cancer. Median prostate volume was 28.4 cc.

Interfraction translational IGRT is now standard, and intrafraction motion management is becoming accessible. Some platforms can report both translational and rotational movements in real time. This study aims to quantify the dosimetric impact of observed intrafraction rotation of the prostate measured using monitoring software.  Materials and methods:   A dose grid resampling algorithm was used to model the dosimetric impact of prostate rotations for 20 patients on a SBRT prostate clinical trial. Translations were corrected before and during treatment, but rotations were not. Real time rotation data were acquired using KIM and a cumulative histogram analysis performed. Prostate volumes were rotated by the range of observed angles and used to calculate DVH data.  Results:   The pitch axis had a higher range of observed rotations resulting in only 7 patients spending at least 90% of the beam on time across all fractions within rotation angles resulting in PTV D95% ≥36 Gy in this axis. The yaw and roll axes saw 17 and 15 patients respectively achieving this criterion. All but one of 20 patients exceeded CTV D98% ≥36 Gy for all observed rotation angles.  Conclusions:   Current CTV-PTV margins do not result in compromised CTV dose coverage due to inter and intrafraction prostate rotations in the absence of other uncertainties. Reduced PTV dosing is due to the extremely conformal treatment delivery but is unlikely to be clinically deleterious. Prostate standard IGRT should continue to focus on correcting any observed translational movements.

Materials and methods:   The phantom study evaluated accuracy in presence of known translations and rotations. Then intra-fraction motions were analyzed for 10 prostate cancer patients implanted with the EM-T 8 days before the simulation CT (171 sessions). The percent time in which the differences between the systems were 1-5 mm were scored for each direction.  Results:   Experiments on phantom confirmed no interference between the systems and showed deviations of less than 0.5 mm when translations were applied progressively. In presence of rotations (5-15°), both systems displayed systematic shifts up to 6.9 and 3.8 mm for the TP-US and the EM-T, respectively. Absolute mean differences between displacements observed on patients with EM-T and TP-US were ≤0.55 mm in all directions except for one patient (≤1.77 mm). With an exception for this patient, a strong correlation was found in left-right direction: differences >2 mm were monitored less than 0.22% of the time (mean acquisition time:164 minutes) and never exceeded 5 s. Maximum differences were observed in supero-inferior direction with differences >2 mm monitored more than 6.5% of the time for 3 patients. Large prostate rotations, the presence of gas and EM-T location in the prostate may explain important differences.

The aim of this work is to validate the methods incorporated in PRIMO to evaluate the deviations introduced in the dose distributions by errors in the positioning of the leaves of the multileaf collimator recorded in the dynalog files during patient treatment.  Methods:   The reconstruction of treatment plans from Varian's dynalog files was implemented in the PRIMO system. Dose distributions were estimated for volumetric-modulated arc therapy clinical cases of prostate and head&neck using the PRIMO fast Monte Carlo engine DPM. Accuracy of the implemented reconstruction methods was evaluated by comparing dose distributions obtained from the simulations of the plans imported from the treatment planning system with those obtained from the simulations of the plans reconstructed from the expected leaves positions recorded in the dynalog files. The impact on the dose of errors in the positions of the leaves was evaluated by comparing dose distributions estimated for plans reconstructed from expected leaves positions with dose distributions estimated from actual leaves positions. Gamma pass rate (GPR), a hereby introduced quantity named percentage of agreement (PA) and the percentage of voxels with a given systematic difference (α/Δ) were the quantities used for the comparisons. Errors were introduced in leaves positions in order to study the sensitivity of these quantities.  Results:   A good agreement of the dose distributions obtained from the plan imported from the TPS and from the plan reconstructed from expected leaves positions was obtained. Not a significantly better agreement was obtained for an imported plan with an increased number of control points such as to approximately match the number of records in the dynalogs. When introduced errors were predominantly in one direction, the methods employed in this work were sensitive to dynalogs with root-mean-square errors (RMS) ≥0.2 mm. Nevertheless, when errors were in both directions, only RMS >1.2 mm produced detectable deviations in the dose. The PA and the α/Δ showed more sensitive to errors in the leaves positions than the GPR.  Conclusions:   Methods to verify the accuracy of the radiotherapy treatment from the information recorded in the Varian's dynalog files were implemented and verified in this work for the PRIMO system. Tolerance limits could be established based on the values of PA and α/Δ.

In this study, we further assess the anti-metastatic properties of mifepristone, by studying whether cytostatic doses of the drug can inhibit the migration and invasion of various cancer cell lines using a double fluorescence cytochemical labeling approach.  Methods:   Cell lines representing cancers of the ovary (SKOV-3), breast (MDA-MB-231), glia (U87MG), or prostate (LNCaP) were treated with cytostatic concentrations of mifepristone. Wound healing and Boyden chamber assays were utilized to study cellular migration. To study cellular invasion, the Boyden chamber assay was prepared by adding a layer of extracellular matrix over the polycarbonate membrane. We enhanced the assays with the addition of double fluorescence cytochemical staining for fibrillar actin (F-actin) and DNA to observe the patterns of cytoskeletal distribution and nuclear positioning while cells migrate and invade.  Results:   When exposed to cytostatic concentrations of mifepristone, all cancer cells lines demonstrated a decrease in both migration and invasion capacities measured using standard approaches.

This paper reports an evaluation of a service improvement initiative for the follow-up care of prostate cancer patients based on remote monitoring and supported self-management.  Methods:   This multi-centred, historically controlled study compared patient reported outcomes of men experiencing the new Programme with men experiencing a traditional clinic appointment model of follow-up care, who were recruited in the period immediately prior to the introduction of the Programme. Data were collected by self-completed questionnaires, with follow up measurement at four and eight months post-baseline. The primary outcome was men's unmet survivorship needs, measured by the Cancer Survivors' Unmet Needs Survey. Secondary outcomes included cancer specific quality of life, psychological wellbeing and satisfaction with care. The analysis was intention to treat. Regression analyses were conducted for outcomes at each time point separately, controlling for pre-defined clinical and demographic variables. All outcome analyses are presented in the paper. Costs were compared between the two groups.  Results:   Six hundred and twenty-seven men (61%) were consented to take part in the study (293 in the Programme and 334 in the comparator group.) Regarding the primary measure of unmet survivorship needs, 25 of 26 comparisons favoured the Programme, of which 4 were statistically significant. For the secondary measures of activation for self-management, quality of life, psychological well-being and lifestyle, 20 of 32 comparisons favoured the Programme and 3 were statistically significant. There were 22 items on the satisfaction with care questionnaire and 13 were statistically significant. Per participant costs (British pounds, 2015) in the 8 month follow up period were slightly lower in the programme than in the comparator group (£289 versus £327). The Programme was acceptable to patients.  Conclusion:   The Programme is shown to be broadly comparable to traditional follow-up care in all respects, adding to evidence of the viability of such models.""","""['Jane Frankland', 'Hazel Brodie', 'Deborah Cooke', 'Claire Foster', 'Rebecca Foster', 'Heather Gage', 'Jake Jordan', 'Ines Mesa-Eguiagaray', 'Ruth Pickering', 'Alison Richardson']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""BMC Cancer""","""['Follow-up care after treatment for prostate cancer: protocol for an evaluation of a nurse-led supported self-management and remote surveillance programme.', 'Symptoms, unmet needs, psychological well-being and health status in survivors of prostate cancer: implications for redesigning follow-up.', 'Long-term unmet supportive care needs of prostate cancer survivors: 15-year follow-up from the NSW Prostate Cancer Care and Outcomes Study.', 'How does active surveillance for prostate cancer affect quality of life?

Given an increased incidence of rectal cancer in younger people and improved survival for rectal cancer patients who received radiation therapy, the potential risk of secondary prostate cancer needs to be further investigated. Materials and Methods: Male patients (n = 11,367) newly diagnosed rectal cancer and who underwent abdominoperineal resection (APR) or low anterior resection (LAR) from 1 January, 1998 to 31 December, 2010 were identified from Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database. The incidence and relative risk of secondary prostate cancer in study patients with (n = 1586) and without (n = 9781) radiotherapy within one year after rectal cancer diagnosis were compared using a competing-risks analysis. Results: Rectal cancer patients with radiotherapy were at a significantly decreased risk of developing prostate cancer, with a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.41 (95% confidence interval = 0.20⁻0.83) after adjustment for age. Analysis of the risk estimated for various follow-up lengths suggested that a decreasing HR was seen through the period followed-up and that there was a trend of decreasing prostate cancer risk with time after radiotherapy.

However, our understanding of the effect of these therapies on the immune system in mCRPC patients remains limited. Here, we examined how abiraterone and enzalutamide treatment affects levels of soluble immune mediators in plasma and in circulating immune cells of 44 mCRPC patients. We found that the baseline levels of cytokines fibroblast growth factor (FGF), granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), interleukin 10 (IL-10), and IL-6 were significantly lower in ADT-sensitive compared to de novo resistant patients. In addition, resistant patients showed significantly lower T cell frequencies. When comparing the levels of cytokines over the course of treatment, we observed that the levels of proinflammatory mediators, such as interferon-γ (IFN-γ), IL-5, macrophage inflammatory protein 1 alpha (MIP-1α), and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα), were significantly increased in the ADT-sensitive patients. At the same time, the abiraterone/enzalutamide therapy did not reduce the percentage of tolerogenic myeloid cell populations, such as polymorphonuclear myeloid-derived suppressor cells, which retained unaltered expression of programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) and B7-H3.

Prostate cancer represents the most common cancer diagnosed in men, and each phase of tumor progression displays specific cellular conditions: inflammation is predominant in tumor's early stage, whereas oxidative stress is typical of clinically advanced PCa. The aim of this research is to assess the correspondence between the stimulus-specificity of STAT3 PTMs and definite STAT3-mediated transcriptional programs, in order to identify new suitable pharmacological targets for PCa treatment. Experiments were performed on less-aggressive LNCaP and more aggressive DU-145 cell lines, simulating inflammatory and oxidative-stress conditions. Cellular studies confirmed pY705-STAT3 as common denominator of all STAT3-mediated signaling. In addition, acK685-STAT3 was found in response to IL-6, whereas glutC328/542-STAT3 and pS727-STAT3 occurred upon tert-butyl hydroperoxyde (tBHP) treatment. Obtained results also provided evidence of an interplay between STAT3 PTMs and specific protein interactors such as P300 and APE1/Ref-1.

Basigin is proteolytically shed from the cell surface and high concentrations of soluble basigin in the blood dictates poor prognosis in cancer patients. A positive correlation between basigin and a disintegrin and metalloproteinase (ADAM)-12 in serum from prostate cancer patients has been reported. Yet, the functional relevance of this correlation is unknown. Here, we show that ADAM12 interacts with basigin and cleaves it in the juxtamembrane region. Specifically, overexpression of ADAM12 increases ectodomain shedding of an alkaline phosphatase-tagged basigin reporter protein from the cell surface. Moreover, CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockout of ADAM12 in human HeLa carcinoma cells results in reduced shedding of the basigin reporter, which can be rescued by ADAM12 re-expression. We detected endogenous basigin fragments, corresponding to the expected size of the ADAM12-generated ectodomain, in conditioned media from ADAM12 expressing cancer cell-lines, as well as serum samples from a healthy pregnant donor and five bladder cancer patients, known to contain high ADAM12 levels. Supporting the cancer relevance of our findings, we identified several cancer-associated mutations in the basigin membrane proximal region. Subsequent in vitro expression showed that some of these mutants are more prone to ADAM12-mediated shedding and that the shed ectodomain can enhance gelatin degradation by cancer cells. In conclusion, we identified ADAM12 as a novel basigin sheddase with a potential implication in cancer.""","""['Reidar Albrechtsen', 'Nicolai J Wewer Albrechtsen', 'Sebastian Gnosa', 'Jeanette Schwarz', 'Lars Dyrskjøt', 'Marie Kveiborg']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Int J Mol Sci""","""['EMMPRIN and ADAM12 in prostate cancer: preliminary results of a prospective study.', 'ADAM12 is expressed in the tumour vasculature and mediates ectodomain shedding of several membrane-anchored endothelial proteins.', 'Metalloprotease-disintegrin ADAM12 actively promotes the stem cell-like phenotype in claudin-low breast cancer.', 'From putative brain tumor marker to high cognitive abilities: Emerging roles of a disintegrin and metalloprotease (ADAM) 12 in the brain.', ""Structural insights on druggable hotspots in CD147: A bull's eye view."", 'Role of CD147 in the development and diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma.', 'The prominent role of the S100A8/S100A9-CD147 axis in the progression of penile cancer.', 'Soluble CD147 (BSG) as a Prognostic Marker in Multiple Myeloma.', 'Novel long non-coding RNA CYB561-5 promotes aerobic glycolysis and tumorigenesis by interacting with basigin in non-small cell lung cancer.', 'BSG (CD147) Serum Level and Genetic Variants Are Associated with Overall Survival in Acute Myeloid Leukaemia.']"""

Several models of this transdifferentiation provide insight into its molecular pathogenesis and have highlighted the placental gene PEG10 for further study. Using our unique model of enzalutamide resistance (ENZR) and NE differentiation, we studied PEG10/AR interplay in enzalutamide treatment-resistant cell lines 42DENZR and 42FENZR compared to LNCaP and castration-resistant 16DCRPC cells. ENZR cell lines with positive terminal NE marker status also displayed higher baseline expression of PEG10 compared to LNCaP and 16DCRPC. Antagonism of AR activity increased PEG10 expression followed by an increase in terminal NE markers. Conversely, stimulating AR activity via androgen supplementation reversed PEG10 and NE marker expression in a time and dose-dependent manner. These results were supported by human data showing that PEG10 expression is highest in NEPC and that AR-dependent gene, PSA, is negatively correlated with PEG10 in adenocarcinoma. Further, ChIP assay confirmed binding of activated AR to the PEG10 enhancer, decreasing PEG10 expression. While PEG10 did not drive NEPC, its knockdown reduced NE markers in our cell lines. Moreover, PEG10 knockdown in vitro- and in vivo-attenuated tumor growth. Overall, these observations indicate that PEG10 is an AR-repressed gene which modulates NE markers in ENZR cells and targeting PEG10 in advanced prostate cancer with NE features is a rational and viable option.""","""['Soojin Kim', 'Daksh Thaper', 'Samir Bidnur', 'Paul Toren', 'Shusuke Akamatsu', 'Jennifer L Bishop', 'Colin Colins', 'Sepideh Vahid', 'Amina Zoubeidi']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""J Mol Endocrinol""","""['Preclinical Study using Malat1 Small Interfering RNA or Androgen Receptor Splicing Variant 7 Degradation Enhancer ASC-J9® to Suppress Enzalutamide-resistant Prostate Cancer Progression.', 'Combined N-terminal androgen receptor and autophagy inhibition increases the antitumor effect in enzalutamide sensitive and enzalutamide resistant prostate cancer cells.', 'The Master Neural Transcription Factor BRN2 Is an Androgen Receptor-Suppressed Driver of Neuroendocrine Differentiation in Prostate Cancer.', 'Prostate cancer: AR aberrations and resistance to abiraterone or enzalutamide.', 'Molecular model for neuroendocrine prostate cancer progression.', 'UBQLN2 restrains the domesticated retrotransposon PEG10 to maintain neuronal health in ALS.', 'PredictiveNetwork: predictive gene network estimation with application to gastric cancer drug response-predictive network analysis.', 'Drug-Induced Epigenomic Plasticity Reprograms Circadian Rhythm Regulation to Drive Prostate Cancer toward Androgen Independence.', 'Aggressive variants of prostate cancer: underlying mechanisms of neuroendocrine transdifferentiation.', 'Regulation of Neuroendocrine-like Differentiation in Prostate Cancer by Non-Coding RNAs.']"""

Currently, one of the most investigated agents for cancer targeting is hyaluronic acid (HA), since its receptor, CD44, is overexpressed in many cancers. However, most of the studies on CD44/HA interaction have been so far performed in cell-free or genetically modified systems, thus leaving some uncertainty regarding which cell-related factors influence HA binding and internalization (collectively called ""uptake"") into CD44-expressing cells. To address this, the expression of CD44 (both standard and variants, designated CD44s and CD44v, respectively) was evaluated in human dermal fibroblasts (HDFs) and a large panel of cancer cell lines, including breast, prostate, head and neck, pancreatic, ovarian, colorectal, thyroid, and endometrial cancers. Results showed that CD44 isoform profiles and expression levels vary across the cancer cell lines and HDF and are not consistent within the cell origin. Using composite information of CD44 expression, HA binding, and internalization, we found that the expression of CD44v can negatively influence the uptake of HA, and, instead, when cells primarily expressed CD44s, a positive correlation was observed between expression and uptake. In other words, CD44shigh cells bound and internalized more HA compared to CD44slow cells. Moreover, CD44shigh HDFs were less efficient in uptaking HA compared to CD44shigh cancer cells. The experiments described here are the first step toward understanding the interplay between CD44 expression, its functionality, and the underlying mechanism(s) for HA uptake. The results show that factors other than the amount of CD44 receptor can play a role in the interaction with HA, and this represents an important advance with respect to the design of HA-based carriers and the selection of tumors to treat according to their CD44 expression profile.""","""['Alice Spadea', 'Julio Manuel Rios de la Rosa', 'Annalisa Tirella', 'Marianne B Ashford', 'Kaye J Williams', 'Ian J Stratford', 'Nicola Tirelli', 'Manal Mehibel']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Mol Pharm""","""['Binding and Internalization in Receptor-Targeted Carriers: The Complex Role of CD44 in the Uptake of Hyaluronic Acid-Based Nanoparticles (siRNA Delivery).', 'CD44s Assembles Hyaluronan Coat on Filopodia and Extracellular Vesicles and Induces Tumorigenicity of MKN74 Gastric Carcinoma Cells.', 'Cellular uptake and internalization of hyaluronan-based doxorubicin and cisplatin conjugates.', 'CD44: structure, function, and association with the malignant process.', 'Anticancer therapeutics: targeting macromolecules and nanocarriers to hyaluronan or CD44, a hyaluronan receptor.', 'Molecular basis of PIP2-dependent conformational switching of phosphorylated CD44 in binding FERM.', 'Role of Hyaluronic Acid in Selected Malignant Neoplasms in Women.', 'Targeted Lymphoma Therapy Using a Gold Nanoframework-Based Drug Delivery System.', 'Hyaluronic Acid-Modified Cisplatin-Encapsulated Poly(Lactic-co-Glycolic Acid) Magnetic Nanoparticles for Dual-Targeted NIR-Responsive Chemo-Photothermal Combination Cancer Therapy.', ""Activated Leukocyte Cell Adhesion Molecule (ALCAM), a Potential 'Seed' and 'Soil' Receptor in the Peritoneal Metastasis of Gastrointestinal Cancers.""]"""

Preoperative information including age, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level, body mass index (BMI), International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) and QoL score was collected, with IPSS and QoL score compared between baseline (preoperatively) and 12 months post-surgery.  Results:   Of the 1917 patients who underwent RARP, 1470 with complete data were included in the analysis.

The post-RARP mean IPSS in the present study was lower than those reported in the existing post-radiotherapy literature, especially in patients with moderate to severe baseline LUTS (IPSSs ≥ 8).  Conclusions:   At 12 months post RARP, most patients reported improved overall LUTS and QoL, with the greatest benefit seen in those patients with a high pre-RARP IPSS.

Patients and methods:   All patients treated with curative intent with EBRT for PCa at a major cancer centre between 2000 and 2007 were included in this study. The outcome measures of time to biochemical failure (BF), metastasis, PCa-specific mortality and overall survival (OS) were analysed in those taking metformin vs those not, using competing risk and Cox regression models. To determine metformin's effect on HIF1α expression and survival in vitro, PC3 cells with high basal HIF1α levels were subjected to increasing doses of metformin after H2 O2 -induced oxidative stress.  Results:   A total of 2055 eligible cases, including 113 who were on metformin, were identified, with a median follow-up of 95.7 months. There were no differences in age, initial prostate-specific antigen level, Gleason score, T-stage, D'Amico risk class or duration of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) between patients who were or were not on metformin. Treatment with metformin did not result in any apparent improvement in time to BF, time to metastasis detection or OS, but there was a 1.5-fold increase in PCa-specific deaths (P = 0.045) in patients on metformin and ADT when adjusted for cancer risk and comorbidities. When comparing patients on high-dose metformin (>1 g/d) with those on low-dose metformin (≤1 g), there was no difference in either time to metastases or time to BF. In vitro metformin at a high concentration of 100 μM did not reduce HIF1α expression, nor did metformin affect the PC3 cell survival when exposed to oxidative stress (H2 O2 ).  Conclusions:   No association was found between the use of metformin and time to metastasis detection, time to BF or OS in patients undergoing radiation therapy with or without ADT for PCa.

Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) is selectively overexpressed on advanced, castration-resistant tumors. Lutetium-177-labeled anti-PSMA monoclonal antibody J591 (177 Lu-J591) targets prostate cancer with efficacy and dose-response/toxicity data when delivered as a single dose. Dose fractionation may allow higher doses to be administered safely.  Method:   Men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer refractory to or refusing standard treatment options with normal neutrophil and platelet counts were enrolled in initial phase 1b dose-escalation cohorts followed by phase 2a cohorts treated at recommended phase 2 doses (RP2Ds) comprising 2 fractionated doses of 177 Lu-J591 2 weeks apart. 177 Lu-J591 imaging was performed after treatment, but no selection for PSMA expression was performed before enrollment. Phase 2 patients had circulating tumor cell (CTC) counts assessed before and after treatment.  Results:   Forty-nine men received fractionated doses of 177 Lu-J591 ranging from 20 to 45 mCi/m2 ×2 two weeks apart. The dose-limiting toxicity in phase 1 was neutropenia. The RP2Ds were 40 mCi/m2 and 45 mCi/m2 ×2. At the highest RP2D (45 mCi/m2 ×2), 35.3% of patients had reversible grade 4 neutropenia, and 58.8% of patients had thrombocytopenia. This dose showed a greater decrease in prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels and longer survival (87.5% with any PSA decrease, 58.8% with >30% decrease, 29.4% with >50% decrease; median survival, 42.3 months [95% confidence interval, 19.9-64.7]). Fourteen of 17 (82%) patients with detectable CTCs experienced a decrease in CTC count. Overall, 79.6% of patients had positive PSMA imaging; those with less intense PSMA imaging tended to have poorer responses.

When present in needle biopsy (NBX) without IDC-P, the clinical significance is not known.  Methods and results:   Sixty-two NBX cases were diagnosed as AIP over 7 years with estimated incidence of 1%. AIP was characterised by loose cribriform architecture (90%) or non-cribriform architecture exhibiting significant nuclear atypia that fell short of IDC-P. Fifty patients had concomitant PCa (20% grade group (GG) 1, 48% GG2, 14% GG3, 8% GG4 and 10% GG 5), and 12 had AIP alone. Of 40 patients who were candidates for no therapy (AIP alone) or active surveillance (AIP with GG1 or GG2 PCa without cribriform pattern 4), 20 had subsequent follow-up pathology [seven NBXs and 13 radical prostatectomy (RP)]. Of the 12 AIP only patients, six had a subsequent biopsy diagnosis of: benign prostate (two), IDC-P with PCa (one) and PCa (three).

Methods:   Differentially expressed lncRNA LINC00304 was identified using a publicly available gene expression data set (GSE38241) and quantitative polymerase chain reaction validation. The Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analysis were used to predict the molecular function of LINC00304. A lncRNA microarray, bioinformatic analysis, and chromatin immunoprecipitation assay were carried out to verify the upstream androgen receptor (AR) signaling pathway. Subsequently, the function of LINC00304 was observed by a series of in vitro assays.  Results:   We observed higher expression of LINC00304 in PCa cells and samples compared with normal prostate cells and tissues. Functional analysis of LINC00304 showed it was related to regulating cell cycle process, cellular developmental process, and focal adhesion. Further, we identified androgen-inhibited lncRNA, LINC00304 as a direct target of AR. A series of functional studies revealed that overexpression of LINC00304 could significantly promote cell proliferation and cell cycle progression in PCa cells. We also find that LINC00304 can significantly promote CCNA1 expression in PCa cells.

For each tumor area, correlations with histopathological results were defined for tumor localization, extraprostatic extension (EPE) of the tumor, invasion of seminal vesicle (SVI) and bladder neck invasion (BNI). In patients with regional lymph node (LN) dissection, histopathological results were also correlated with imaging modalities.  Results:   Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and accuracy for detection of EPE and SVI were higher for mp-MRI than Ga-68 PSMA-11 PET/CT. On the other hand Ga-68 PSMA-11 PET/CT had significant successful results for detection of LN metastases when compared with mp-MRI. But for BNI detection both modalities had same insufficient results. Ga-68 PSMA-11 PET/CT had strong results for appropriate tumor localization in the gland.

A panel of BCa cell lines show that two invasive lines, UM-UC-3 and 253J-BV, both express these transcription factors but UM-UC-3 produces more SHH ligand and is less responsive in viability to pathway stimulation by recombinant human SHH or smoothened agonist, and less responsive to inhibitors including the smoothened inhibitors cyclopamine and SANT-1. In contrast, 253J-BV was highly responsive to these manipulations. We utilized a GLI1 and GLI2 antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) to bypass pathway mechanics and target the transcription factors directly. UM-UC-3 decreased in viability due to both ASOs but 253J-BV was only affected by GLI2 ASO.

However, our understanding of the global changes of protein complexes within PCa tissue specimens remains very limited, although it has been well recognized that protein complexes carry out essentially all major processes in living organisms and that their deregulation drives the pathogenesis and progression of various diseases.  Methods:   By coupling tandem mass tagging-synchronous precursor selection-mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry with differential expression and co-regulation analyses, the present study compared the differences between protein complexes in normal prostate, low-grade PCa, and high-grade PCa tissue specimens.  Results:   Globally, a large downregulated putative protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was detected in both low-grade and high-grade PCa, yet a large upregulated putative PPI network was only detected in high-grade but not low-grade PCa, compared with normal controls. To identify specific protein complexes that are deregulated in PCa, quantified proteins were mapped to protein complexes in CORUM (v3.0), a high-quality collection of 4274 experimentally verified mammalian protein complexes. Differential expression and gene ontology (GO) enrichment analyses suggested that 13 integrin complexes involved in cell adhesion were significantly downregulated in both low- and high-grade PCa compared with normal prostate, and that four Prothymosin alpha (ProTα) complexes were significantly upregulated in high-grade PCa compared with normal prostate. Moreover, differential co-regulation and GO enrichment analyses indicated that the assembly levels of six protein complexes involved in RNA splicing were significantly increased in low-grade PCa, and those of four subcomplexes of mitochondrial complex I were significantly increased in high-grade PCa, compared with normal prostate.  Conclusions:   In summary, to the best of our knowledge, the study represents the first large-scale and quantitative, albeit indirect, comparison of individual protein complexes in human PCa tissue specimens.

We sought to develop a transcriptomic signature for detecting biallelic RB1 loss (RBS) that could be used to assess the clinical implications of RB1 loss on a pan-cancer scale.  Experimental design:   We utilized data from the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (N = 995) to develop the first pan-cancer transcriptomic signature for predicting biallelic RB1 loss (RBS). Model accuracy was validated using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Pan-Cancer dataset (N = 11,007). RBS was then used to assess the clinical relevance of biallelic RB1 loss in TCGA Pan-Cancer and in an additional metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) cohort.  Results:   RBS outperformed the leading existing signature for detecting RB1 biallelic loss across all cancer types in TCGA Pan-Cancer (AUC, 0.89 vs. 0.66). High RBS (RB1 biallelic loss) was associated with promoter hypermethylation (P = 0.008) and gene body hypomethylation (P = 0.002), suggesting RBS could detect epigenetic gene silencing. TCGA Pan-Cancer clinical analyses revealed that high RBS was associated with short progression-free (P < 0.00001), overall (P = 0.0004), and disease-specific (P < 0.00001) survival. On multivariable analyses, high RBS was predictive of shorter progression-free survival in TCGA Pan-Cancer (P = 0.03) and of shorter overall survival in mCRPC (P = 0.004) independently of the number of DNA alterations in RB1.  Conclusions:   Our study provides the first validated tool to assess RB1 biallelic loss across cancer types based on gene expression. RBS can be useful for analyzing datasets with or without DNA-sequencing results to investigate the emerging prognostic and treatment implications of Rb-pathway disruption.See related commentary by Choudhury and Beltran, p. 4199.""","""['William S Chen#', 'Mohammed Alshalalfa#', 'Shuang G Zhao', 'Yang Liu', 'Brandon A Mahal', 'David A Quigley', 'Ting Wei', 'Elai Davicioni', 'Timothy R Rebbeck', 'Philip W Kantoff', 'Christopher A Maher', 'Karen E Knudsen', 'Eric J Small', 'Paul L Nguyen#', 'Felix Y Feng#']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Clin Cancer Res""","""['Retinoblastoma Loss in Cancer: Casting a Wider Net.', 'Transcriptomic and Clinical Characterization of Neuropeptide Y Expression in Localized and Metastatic Prostate Cancer: Identification of Novel Prostate Cancer Subtype with Clinical Implications.', 'Significance of BRCA2 and RB1 Co-loss in Aggressive Prostate Cancer Progression.', 'A radiomics approach to assess tumour-infiltrating CD8 cells and response to anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 immunotherapy: an imaging biomarker, retrospective multicohort study.', 'Prognostic signature associated with radioresistance in head and neck cancer via transcriptomic and bioinformatic analyses.', 'A gene expression signature of retinoblastoma loss-of-function is a predictive biomarker of resistance to palbociclib in breast cancer cell lines and is prognostic in patients with ER positive early breast cancer.', 'Increased mRNA expression of CDKN2A is a transcriptomic marker of clinically aggressive meningiomas.', 'Significance of RB Loss in Unlocking Phenotypic Plasticity in Advanced Cancers.', 'RB1-deficient prostate tumor growth and metastasis are vulnerable to ferroptosis induction via the E2F/ACSL4 axis.', 'Atypical responses to neoadjuvant chemotherapy combined with accelerated partial breast tumor-directed radiotherapy: two cases and considerations for future clinical trials.', 'Retinoblastoma Expression and Targeting by CDK4/6 Inhibitors in Small Cell Lung Cancer.']"""

The major reason for this gap in knowledge is that this disease is relatively uncommon (except in Asians), making it difficult to assemble an adequate study sample. In this study we conducted a genome-wide association study on the largest, to date, set of European-descent never-smokers with lung cancer.  Methods:   We conducted a two-phase (discovery and replication) genome-wide association study in never-smokers of European descent. We further augmented the sample by performing a meta-analysis with never-smokers from the recent OncoArray study, which resulted in a total of 3636 cases and 6295 controls. We also compare our findings with those in smokers with lung cancer.  Results:   We detected three genome-wide statistically significant single nucleotide polymorphisms rs31490 (odds ratio [OR]: 0.769, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.722-0.820; p value 5.31 × 10-16), rs380286 (OR: 0.770, 95% CI: 0.723-0.820; p value 4.32 × 10-16), and rs4975616 (OR: 0.778, 95% CI: 0.730-0.829; p value 1.04 × 10-14). All three mapped to Chromosome 5 CLPTM1L-TERT region, previously shown to be associated with lung cancer risk in smokers and in never-smoker Asian women, and risk of other cancers including breast, ovarian, colorectal, and prostate.  Conclusions:   We found that genetic susceptibility to lung cancer in never-smokers is associated to genetic variants with pan-cancer risk effects. The comparison with smokers shows that top variants previously shown to be associated with lung cancer risk only confer risk in the presence of tobacco exposure, underscoring the importance of gene-environment interactions in the etiology of this disease.""","""['Rayjean J Hung', 'Margaret R Spitz', 'Richard S Houlston', 'Ann G Schwartz', 'John K Field', 'Jun Ying', 'Yafang Li', 'Younghun Han', 'Xuemei Ji', 'Wei Chen', 'Xifeng Wu', 'Ivan P Gorlov', 'Jie Na', 'Mariza de Andrade', 'Geoffrey Liu', 'Yonathan Brhane', 'Nancy Diao', 'Angela Wenzlaff', 'Michael P A Davies', 'Triantafillos Liloglou', 'Maria Timofeeva', 'Thomas Muley', 'Hedy Rennert', 'Walid Saliba', 'Bríd M Ryan', 'Elise Bowman', 'Juan-Miguel Barros-Dios', 'Mónica Pérez-Ríos', 'Hal Morgenstern', 'Shanbeh Zienolddiny', 'Vidar Skaug', 'Donatella Ugolini', 'Stefano Bonassi', 'Erik H F M van der Heijden', 'Adonina Tardon', 'Stig E Bojesen', 'Maria Teresa Landi', 'Mattias Johansson', 'Heike Bickeböller', 'Susanne Arnold', 'Loic Le Marchand', 'Olle Melander', 'Angeline Andrew', 'Kjell Grankvist', 'Neil Caporaso', 'M Dawn Teare', 'Matthew B Schabath', 'Melinda C Aldrich', 'Lambertus A Kiemeney', 'H-Erich Wichmann', 'Philip Lazarus', 'Jose Mayordomo', 'Monica Neri', 'Aage Haugen', 'Zuo-Feng Zhang', 'Alberto Ruano-Raviña', 'Hermann Brenner', 'Curtis C Harris', 'Irene Orlow', 'Gadi Rennert', 'Angela Risch', 'Paul Brennan', 'David C Christiani', 'Christopher I Amos', 'Ping Yang', 'Olga Y Gorlova']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""J Thorac Oncol""","""['Role of 5p15.33 (TERT-CLPTM1L), 6p21.33 and 15q25.1 (CHRNA5-CHRNA3) variation and lung cancer risk in never-smokers.', 'Novel genetic variants in the chromosome 5p15.33 region associate with lung cancer risk.', 'Fine mapping of chromosome 5p15.33 identifies novel lung cancer susceptibility loci in Han Chinese.', 'Systematic Review of Genetic Variation in Chromosome 5p15.33 and Telomere Length as Predictive and Prognostic Biomarkers for Lung Cancer.', 'Telomerase reverse transcriptase locus polymorphisms and cancer risk: a field synopsis and meta-analysis.', 'Genome-wide association study of lung adenocarcinoma in East Asia and comparison with a European population.', 'Global burden of cancers attributable to tobacco smoking, 1990-2019: an ecological study.', 'Cross-ancestry genome-wide meta-analysis of 61,047 cases and 947,237 controls identifies new susceptibility loci contributing to lung cancer.', 'Functional studies of lung cancer GWAS beyond association.', 'Deciphering associations between three RNA splicing-related genetic variants and lung cancer risk.']"""

H4pypa is very functionally versatile and biologically stable. Compared to the conventional chelators (e.g., DOTA, DTPA), H4pypa has outstanding affinities for both 111In (EC, t1/2 ≈ 2.8 days) and 177Lu (β-,γ, t1/2 ≈ 6.64 days). Its radiolabeled complexes were achieved at >98% radiochemical yield, RT within 10 min, at a ligand concentration as low as 10-6 M, with excellent stability in human serum over at least 5-7 days (<1% transchelation). The thermodynamic stabilities of the [M(pypa)]- complexes (M3+ = In3+, Lu3+, La3+) were dependent on the ionic radii, where the smaller In3+ has the highest pM value (30.5), followed by Lu3+ (22.6) and La3+ (19.9). All pM values are remarkably higher than those with DOTA, DTPA, H4octapa, H4octox, and H4neunpa. Moreover, the facile and versatile bifunctionalization enabled by the p-OH group in the central pyridyl bridge of the pypa scaffold (compound 14) allows incorporation of a variety of linkers for bioconjugation through easy nucleophilic substitution. In this work, an alkyl linker was selected to couple H4pypa to a PSMA-targeting pharmacophore, proving that the bioconjugation sacrifices neither the tumor-targeting nor the chelation properties.

RWPE-1 cells are immortalized, non-tumorigenic, human prostate epithelia that become malignantly transformed into the CAsE-PE line after continuous in vitro exposure to 5μM arsenite over a period of months. For insight into in vitro arsenite transformation, we performed RNA-seq for differential gene expression and targeted sequencing of KRAS. We report >7,000 differentially expressed transcripts in CAsE-PE cells compared to RWPE-1 cells at >2-fold change, q<0.05 by RNA-seq. Notably, KRAS expression was highly elevated in CAsE-PE cells, with pathway analysis supporting increased cell proliferation, cell motility, survival and cancer pathways. Targeted DNA sequencing of KRAS revealed a mutant specific allelic imbalance, 'MASI', frequently found in primary clinical tumors. We found high expression of a mutated KRAS transcript carrying oncogenic mutations at codons 12 and 59 and many silent mutations, accompanied by lower expression of a wild-type allele. Parallel cultures of RWPE-1 cells retained a wild-type KRAS genotype. Copy number analysis and sequencing showed amplification of the mutant KRAS allele. KRAS is expressed as two splice variants, KRAS4a and KRAS4b, where variant 4b is more prevalent in normal cells compared to greater levels of variant 4a seen in tumor cells. 454 Roche sequencing measured KRAS variants in each cell type. We found KRAS4a as the predominant transcript variant in CAsE-PE cells compared to KRAS4b, the variant expressed primarily in RWPE-1 cells and in normal prostate, early passage, primary epithelial cells. Overall, gene expression data were consistent with KRAS-driven proliferation pathways found in spontaneous tumors and malignantly transformed cell lines. Arsenite is recognized as an important environmental carcinogen, but it is not a direct mutagen.

Metabolomic profiling of radiation-treated PCa patients is particularly important to reveal their new metabolomic status, and evaluate the radiation effects. In addition, bioinformatics-integrated metabolomics-based approaches for disease profiling and assessment of therapy could help develop precision biomarkers in a context of PCa. We report mass spectrometry-based untargeted (global) serum metabolomics findings from patients with PCa (n = 55) before and after treatment with stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT), and intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) with SBRT, and using parsimony phylogenetic analysis. Importantly, the radiation-treated serum metabolome of patients represented a unique robust cluster on a cladogram that was distinct from the pre-RT metabolome. The altered radiation responsive serum metabolome was defined by predominant aberrations in the metabolic pathways of nitrogen, pyrimidine, purine, porphyrin, alanine, aspartate, glutamate, and glycerophospholipid. Our findings collectively suggest that global metabolomics integrated with parsimony phylogenetics offer a unique and robust systems biology analytical platform for powerful unbiased determination of radiotherapy (RT)-associated biosignatures in patients with PCa. These new observations call for future translational research for evaluation of metabolomic biomarkers in PCa prognosis specifically, and response to radiation treatment broadly.

Using DU145 and PC3 cell lines as models of prostate cancer, we investigated whether IL-27 and IFN-γ affect TLR3-mediated cell death. Our results demonstrate that when IL-27 or IFN-γ is added with polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid [poly(I:C)], type I IFN (IFN-I) expression increases concurrently with cell death. IL-27 and IFN-γ enhanced TLR3 expression, suggesting a mechanism for sensitization to cell death. Further, PC3 cells were more sensitive to IL-27/poly(I:C)-induced cell death compared with DU145 cells. This correlated with higher production of IFN-β and inducible protein-10 versus IL-6 in response to treatment of PC3 cells compared with DU145.

Episode based reimbursement is an increasingly relevant value based payment model of surgical care. We sought to quantify the impact of modifiable cost inputs on institutional financial margins in an episode based payment model for prostate cancer surgery.  Materials and methods:   A total of 157 consecutive patients underwent robotic radical prostatectomy in 2016 at a tertiary academic medical center. We compiled comprehensive episode costs and reimbursements from the most recent urology consultation for prostate cancer through 90 days postoperatively and benchmarked the episode price as a fixed reimbursement to the median reimbursement of the cohort. We identified 2 sources of modifiable costs with undefined empirical value, including preoperative prostate magnetic resonance imaging and perioperative functional recovery counseling visits, and then calculated the impact on financial margins (reimbursement minus cost) under an episode based payment.  Results:   Although they comprised a small proportion of the total episode costs, varying the use of preoperative magnetic resonance imaging (33% vs 100% of cases) and functional recovery counseling visits (1 visit in 66% and 2 in 100%) reduced average expected episode financial margins up to 22.6% relative to the margin maximizing scenario in which no patient received these services.  Conclusions:   Modifiable cost inputs have a substantial impact on potential operating margins for prostate cancer surgery under an episode based payment model. High cost health systems must develop the capability to analyze individual cost inputs and quantify the contribution to quality to inform value improvement efforts for multiple service lines.""","""['David C Johnson', 'Eric Kwok', 'Christine Ahn', 'Artem Pashchinskiy', 'Aaron A Laviana', 'Vishnukamal Golla', 'J Thomas Rosenthal', 'Fernanda Bravo', 'Mark S Litwin', 'Christopher S Saigal']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""J Urol""","""['da Vinci and Open Radical Prostatectomy: Comparison of Clinical Outcomes and Analysis of Insurance Costs.', 'Identifying Drivers of Episode Cost Variation With Radical Prostatectomy.', 'Modeling financial outcomes and quantifying risk in episode-based payment models.', 'Robotic Surgical System for Radical Prostatectomy: A Health Technology Assessment.', 'Cost of New Technologies in Prostate Cancer Treatment: Systematic Review of Costs and Cost Effectiveness of Robotic-assisted Laparoscopic Prostatectomy, Intensity-modulated Radiotherapy, and Proton Beam Therapy.']"""

We sought to externally validate the PCCI (Prostate Cancer Comorbidity Index) to predict long-term mortality in men with prostate cancer and make it operational using claims data.  Materials and methods:   We performed an observational study of 181,009 men with prostate cancer in the Veterans Affairs Health System who were diagnosed from 2000 to 2013. Overall mortality across the PCCI scores was analyzed using Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazards analysis. Discrimination and calibration were measured using the C-index and the mean prediction error, respectively.  Results:   Among men with a PCCI score of 0, 1-2, 3-4, 5-6, 7-9 and 10 or greater the 10-year overall mortality rate was 15%, 26%, 36%, 41%, 52% and 69%, respectively. Multivariable Cox analysis showed an increasing hazard of mortality with higher PCCI scores, including 1.22 (95% CI 1.18-1.27), 1.69 (95% CI 1.61-1.76), 2.08 (95% CI 2.00-2.17), 2.88 (95% CI 2.76-3.00) and 4.50 (95% CI 4.32-4.69) for a score of 1 to 2, 3 to 4, 5 to 6, 7 to 9 and 10 or greater, respectively. The C-index to predict overall mortality was 0.773. The mean absolute error to predict 10-year overall mortality was 0.032. Of the men with clinically localized disease, Gleason 6 or less with less than 10-year life expectancy and Gleason 7 or less with life expectancy less than 5 years as defined by the PCCI 3,999 of 12,185 (33%) and 1,038 of 3,930 (26%), respectively, underwent definitive local treatment.  Conclusions:   The PCCI is a claims based, externally validated tool to predict mortality in men with prostate cancer.

In non-small cell lung cancer, miR-370 is a tumor suppressor with decreased expression. In prostate cancer, it is an oncogene with overexpression. Although upregulation of miR-370 was correlated with poor prognosis of breast cancer, the exact function of miR-370 is largely unclear. The roles of miR-370 in breast cancer are investigated, and its downstream targets are identified. miR-370 expression was detected by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction in breast cancer cells. Cell growth curve and colony formation were monitored on overexpressing or knocking down miR-370. We further identified the target of miR-370 and the role of the target in tumorigenesis by using western blot, luciferase assay, and the xenograft mouse model. miR-370 is increased in breast cancer cells. Its overexpression promotes cell growth, whereas the knockdown of miR-370 suppresses cell growth. WNK2 is a downstream target of miR-370. Manipulation of WNK2 expression affects miR-370-mediated cell proliferation and tumor growth. Our data suggest that miR-370 acts as an oncogene by downregulating WNK2 in breast cancer, providing a molecular basis for clinical application of miR-370 as a potential biomarker.""","""['Li Huang', 'Xiangyu Liu']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""DNA Cell Biol""","""['microRNA-324-3p suppresses the aggressive ovarian cancer by targeting WNK2/RAS pathway.', 'MiR-410 Acts as a Tumor Suppressor in Estrogen Receptor-Positive Breast Cancer Cells by Directly Targeting ERLIN2 via the ERS Pathway.', 'miR-135b, upregulated in breast cancer, promotes cell growth and disrupts the cell cycle by regulating LATS2.', 'MicroRNA-9 and breast cancer.', 'MicroRNA-21: from cancer to cardiovascular disease.', 'Breast Cancer: Circular RNAs Mediating Efficacy in Preclinical In Vivo Models.', 'An update regarding the role of WNK kinases in cancer.', 'Lipid Metabolism and Cancer.', 'microRNA-324-3p suppresses the aggressive ovarian cancer by targeting WNK2/RAS pathway.', 'Targeting CD82/KAI1 for Precision Therapeutics in Surmounting Metastatic Potential in Breast Cancer.']"""

They are biocompatible and are currently used in vivo as contrast agents for a variety of medical imaging modalities, including ultrasound, computed tomography, photoacoustic and 19F-magnetic resonance imaging. PFC nanodroplets can also carry molecular and nanoparticulate drugs and be activated in situ by ultrasound or light for targeted therapy. Recently, there has been renewed interest in using PFC nanodroplets for hypoxic tumor reoxygenation towards radiosensitization based on the high oxygen solubility of PFCs. Previous studies showed that tumor oxygenation using PFC agents only occurs in combination with enhanced oxygen breathing. However, recent studies suggest that PFC agents that accumulate in solid tumors can contribute to radiosensitization, presumably due to tumor reoxygenation without enhanced oxygen breathing. In this study, we quantify the impact of oxygenation due to PFC nanodroplet accumulation in tumors alone in comparison with other reoxygenation methodologies, in particular, carbogen breathing. Methods: Lipid-stabilized, PFC (i.e., perfluorooctyl bromide, CF3(CF2)7Br, PFOB) nanoscale droplets were synthesized and evaluated in xenograft prostate (DU145) tumors in male mice. Biodistribution assessment of the nanodroplets was achieved using a fluorescent lipophilic indocarbocyanine dye label (i.e., DiI dye) on the lipid shell in combination with fluorescence imaging in mice (n≥3 per group). Hypoxia reduction in tumors was measured using PET imaging and a known hypoxia radiotracer, [18F]FAZA (n≥ 3 per group). Results: Lipid-stabilized nanoscale PFOB emulsions (mean diameter of ~250 nm), accumulated in the xenograft prostate tumors in mice 24 hours post-injection. In vivo PET imaging with [18F]FAZA showed that the accumulation of the PFOB nanodroplets in the tumor tissues alone significantly reduced tumor hypoxia, without enhanced oxygen (i.e., carbogen) breathing. This reoxygenation effect was found to be comparable with carbogen breathing alone. Conclusion: Accumulation of nanoscale PFOB agents in solid tumors alone successfully reoxygenated hypoxic tumors to levels comparable with carbogen breathing alone, an established tumor oxygenation method. This study confirms that PFC agents can be used to reoxygenate hypoxic tumors in addition to their current applications as multifunctional theranostic agents.""","""['Yun Xiang', 'Nicholas Bernards', 'Bryan Hoang', 'Jinzi Zheng', 'Naomi Matsuura']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Nanotheranostics""","""['18F-Labeled perfluorocarbon droplets for positron emission tomography imaging.', 'Overcoming hypoxia-induced chemoresistance to cisplatin through tumor oxygenation monitored by optical imaging.', 'Effect of carbogen on tumor oxygenation: combined fluorine-19 and proton MRI measurements.', 'Functional ultrasound-triggered phase-shift perfluorocarbon nanodroplets for cancer therapy.', 'Improvement of tumor oxygenation by mild hyperthermia.', 'Towards an In Vitro 3D Model for Photosynthetic Cancer Treatment: A Study of Microalgae and Tumor Cell Interactions.', 'Perfluorocarbon nanodroplet size, acoustic vaporization, and inertial cavitation affected by lipid shell composition in vitro.', 'Recent Strategies to Address Hypoxic Tumor Environments in Photodynamic Therapy.', 'Perfluorocarbon Nanodroplets as Potential Nanocarriers for Brain Delivery Assisted by Focused Ultrasound-Mediated Blood-Brain Barrier Disruption.', 'Laser activatable perfluorocarbon bubbles for imaging and therapy through enhanced absorption from coupled silica coated gold nanoparticles.']"""

A significant overlap of genes and biological processes between both diseases has also been reported.  Methods:   Here, for the first time, we compared the gene expression profiles of ASD frontal cortex tissues and 22 cancer types obtained by differential expression meta-analysis and report gene, pathway, and drug set-based overlaps between them.  Results:   Four cancer types (brain, thyroid, kidney, and pancreatic cancers) presented a significant overlap in gene expression deregulations in the same direction as ASD whereas two cancer types (lung and prostate cancers) showed differential expression profiles significantly deregulated in the opposite direction from ASD. Functional enrichment and LINCS L1000 based drug set enrichment analyses revealed the implication of several biological processes and pathways that were affected jointly in both diseases, including impairments of the immune system, and impairments in oxidative phosphorylation and ATP synthesis among others. Our data also suggest that brain and kidney cancer have patterns of transcriptomic dysregulation in the PI3K/AKT/MTOR axis that are similar to those found in ASD.  Conclusions:   Comparisons of ASD and cancer differential gene expression meta-analysis results suggest that brain, kidney, thyroid, and pancreatic cancers are candidates for direct comorbid associations with ASD. On the other hand, lung and prostate cancers are candidates for inverse comorbid associations with ASD. Joint perturbations in a set of specific biological processes underlie these associations which include several pathways previously implicated in both cancer and ASD encompassing immune system alterations, impairments of energy metabolism, cell cycle, and signaling through PI3K and G protein-coupled receptors among others.

A key mechanism of treatment resistance in advanced PC is the generation of alternatively spliced forms of the AR termed AR variants (AR-Vs) that are refractory to targeted agents and drive tumour progression. Our understanding of how AR-Vs function is limited due to difficulties in distinguishing their discriminate activities from full-length AR (FL-AR). Here we report the development of a novel CRISPR-derived cell line which is a derivative of CWR22Rv1 cells, called CWR22Rv1-AR-EK, that has lost expression of FL-AR, but retains all endogenous AR-Vs. From this, we show that AR-Vs act unhindered by loss of FL-AR to drive cell growth and expression of androgenic genes. Global transcriptomics demonstrate that AR-Vs drive expression of a cohort of DNA damage response genes and depletion of AR-Vs sensitises cells to ionising radiation. Moreover, we demonstrate that AR-Vs interact with PARP1 and PARP2 and are dependent upon their catalytic function for transcriptional activation. Importantly, PARP blockade compromises expression of AR-V-target genes and reduces growth of CRPC cell lines suggesting a synthetic lethality relationship between AR-Vs and PARP, advocating the use of PARP inhibitors in AR-V positive PC.""","""['Evangelia Kounatidou', 'Sirintra Nakjang', 'Stuart R C McCracken', 'Scott M Dehm', 'Craig N Robson', 'Dominic Jones', 'Luke Gaughan']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Nucleic Acids Res""","""['Examining the Effect of PARP-1 Inhibitors on Transcriptional Activity of Androgen Receptor in Prostate Cancer Cells.', 'Context dependent regulatory patterns of the androgen receptor and androgen receptor target genes.', 'Targeting the MYCN-PARP-DNA Damage Response Pathway in Neuroendocrine Prostate Cancer.', 'PARP Inhibitors in Prostate Cancer—The Preclinical Rationale and Current Clinical Development.', 'Androgen receptor-dependent and -independent mechanisms driving prostate cancer progression: Opportunities for therapeutic targeting from multiple angles.', 'Lineage plasticity and treatment resistance in prostate cancer: the intersection of genetics, epigenetics, and evolution.', 'The CDK7 inhibitor CT7001 (Samuraciclib) targets proliferation pathways to inhibit advanced prostate cancer.', 'A kinome-wide CRISPR screen identifies CK1α as a target to overcome enzalutamide resistance of prostate cancer.', 'Harnessing transcriptionally driven chromosomal instability adaptation to target therapy-refractory lethal prostate cancer.', 'Androgen receptor-dependent regulation of metabolism in high grade bladder cancer cells.']"""

SPOP binding triggers their proteasomal degradation. In both endometrial and prostate cancers, SPOP mutations occur in the MATH domain, but with opposed influence on drug susceptibility. In prostate cancer, SPOP mutations presumably cause increased BET levels, decreasing BET inhibitor drug susceptibility. As opposed, in endometrial cancer, decreased BET levels concomitant with higher BET inhibitor drug susceptibility were observed. Here, we present the to our knowledge first co-crystal structure of SPOP and a bromodomain containing protein (BRD3). Our structural and biophysical data confirm the suggested loss-of-function in prostate cancer-associated SPOP mutants and provide mechanistic explanation. As opposed to previous literature, our data on endometrial cancer-associated SPOP mutants do not show altered binding behavior compared to wild-type SPOP, indicating a more complex regulatory mechanism. SPOP mutation screening may thus be considered a valuable personalized medicine tool for effective antitumor therapy.""","""['Michael Sebastian Ostertag', 'Wiebke Hutwelker', 'Oliver Plettenburg', 'Michael Sattler', 'Grzegorz Maria Popowicz']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""J Mol Biol""","""['Opposing effects of cancer-type-specific SPOP mutants on BET protein degradation and sensitivity to BET inhibitors.', 'Prostate cancer-associated SPOP mutations confer resistance to BET inhibitors through stabilization of BRD4.', 'Intrinsic BET inhibitor resistance in SPOP-mutated prostate cancer is mediated by BET protein stabilization and AKT-mTORC1 activation.', 'The emerging role of speckle-type POZ protein (SPOP) in cancer development.', 'The Roles of SPOP in DNA Damage Response and DNA Replication.', 'Cul3 substrate adaptor SPOP targets Nup153 for degradation.', '3D structural human interactome reveals proteome-wide perturbations by disease mutations.', 'BET Bromodomain Inhibitors: Novel Design Strategies and Therapeutic Applications.', 'Interrogating bromodomain inhibitor resistance in KMT2A-rearranged leukemia through combinatorial CRISPR screens.', 'Higher-order SPOP assembly reveals a basis for cancer mutant dysregulation.']"""

Design:   Retrospective cohort study.  Setting:   Texas, United States.  Participants:   Cancer survivors (5 years or more postcancer diagnosis) diagnosed from 1995 to 2008 and who were also Medicare Parts A, B, and D beneficiaries.  Measurements:   We used Medicare Part D event data to calculate the proportion of cancer survivors with a prolonged opioid prescription (90-day or more supply of opioids/year). Adjusted odds ratios were calculated to identify predictors of prolonged opioid prescribing. All analyses were repeated with a subcohort of opioid-naïve cancer survivors.  Results:   The rate of prolonged opioid therapy for cancer patients diagnosed in 2008 was 7.1% prior to cancer diagnosis; it rose to 9.8% within a year of cancer treatments, and to 13.3% at 5 years postdiagnosis. The rate at the sixth year varied by cancer sites: 19.4% in lung cancer and 9.6% in prostate cancer. Among opioid-naïve survivors, the rate increased from 1.4% to 7.1%, from 5 to 18 years postcancer diagnosis. Cancer survivors diagnosed in 2004 to 2008 had higher rates of opioid prescribing compared to those diagnosed in 1995 to 1998 and 1999 to 2003. Years since diagnosis, a later year of diagnosis, female sex, urban location, lung cancer diagnosis, disability as reason for Medicare entitlement, Medicaid eligibility, one or more comorbidity, and history of depression or drug abuse were predictors of prolonged opioid therapy. Among opioid-naïve cancer survivors, diagnosis in 2004 to 2008 was the strongest predictor, while a history of drug abuse was the strongest predictor for all the survivors.  Conclusion:   The rates of prolonged opioid prescribing for older cancer survivors remained high at 5 or more years after cancer diagnosis. Our findings have potential to inform the development of clinical guidelines and public policy to ensure safer and more effective pain treatment in older cancer survivors.

Rho-associated protein kinase (ROCK) has previously been shown to be upregulated in prostate cancer, but its biological role remains poorly understood. This study aimed to investigate the role of ROCK in the proliferation and migration of PC-3 and DU145 prostate cancer cells and to identify the possible targets involved by knockdown of ROCK1 and ROCK2 RNA expression. MATERIAL AND METHODS An RNA interference (RNAi) assay was performed to silence the expression of ROCK1 and ROCK2 in the PC-3 and DU145 human prostate cancer cell lines. Cells were also treated with a specific ROCK inhibitor, Y27632. A cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) assay was used to determine the proliferation rate of prostate cancer cells, and cell migration and invasion assays were performed. Western blot and polymerase chain reaction were used to measure protein and RNA expression levels. RESULTS In PC-3 and DU145 prostate cancer cells, knockdown of ROCK1 and ROCK2 reduced cell migration and invasion. ROCK1 and ROCK2 regulated cell proliferation in PC-3 and DU145 prostate cancer cells. Protein levels of phosphorylated LIM kinase 1 (p-LIMK1) and matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) were reduced in ROCK1 and ROCK2 siRNA transfected cells.

To ensure the generalizability of assay results we optimized and validated the clinical model for men with serum prostate specific antigen less than 10 ng/ml who were undergoing initial prostate biopsy.  Materials and methods:   Urine samples were collected from 1,955 men from The Netherlands, France and Germany prior to an initial prostate biopsy and study subjects were divided into training and validation cohorts. Urinary HOXC6 and DLX1 mRNA levels were quantified and RNA results were then combined with other risk factors in a clinical model optimized to detect ISUP (International Society of Urological Pathology) Grade Group 2 or greater prostate cancer in men with prostate specific antigen less than 10 ng/ml. Results in the validation cohort were compared with the PCPTRC (Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial Risk Calculator), version 2.0.  Results:   The optimal clinical model included urinary HOXC6 and DLX1 mRNA levels, patient age, digital rectal examination and prostate specific antigen density (serum prostate specific antigen/prostate volume). In the 715 validation cohort subjects with prostate specific antigen less than 10 ng/ml the AUC was 0.82 with 89% sensitivity, 53% specificity and 95% negative predictive value. The PCPTRC AUC was 0.70. The full validation cohort of 916 men including all prostate specific antigen levels yielded an AUC of 0.85 with 93% sensitivity, 47% specificity and 95% negative predictive value.

We sought to determine whether the GPS was associated with an increased risk of adverse pathology findings in men enrolled on active surveillance who later underwent radical prostatectomy.  Materials and methods:   We identified all patients on active surveillance at University of California-San Francisco who had Gleason score 3 + 3 or low volume (33% or fewer positive cores) Gleason score 3 + 4 prostate cancer, GPS testing at diagnostic or confirmatory biopsy, clinical stage T1/T2, prostate specific antigen less than 20 and a clinical CAPRA (Cancer of the Prostate Risk Assessment) score less than 6. The primary outcome was adverse pathology, defined as Gleason score 4 + 3 or greater, stage pT3a or greater, or pN1. The secondary outcome was biochemical recurrence, defined as 2 consecutive prostate specific antigen measurements greater than 0.05 ng/ml following radical prostatectomy.  Results:   Of the 215 men 179 (83%) were at low risk and 36 (17%) were at intermediate risk by CAPRA scoring. The median GPS was 26.4 (IQR 18.8-34.6). On multivariate analysis a higher GPS was associated with an increased risk of adverse pathology at delayed radical prostatectomy (HR/5 units 1.16, 95% CI 1.06-1.26, p <0.01). A higher GPS was also associated with an increased risk of biochemical recurrence (HR/5 units 1.10, 95% CI 1.00-1.21, p=0.04).

We examine (1) whether alcohol intake among men at risk of prostate cancer is associated with diagnosis of lethal prostate cancer and (2) whether intake among men with nonmetastatic prostate cancer is associated with metastasis or death.  Methods:   This prospective cohort study uses the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study (1986 to 2012). Our analysis of alcohol intake among men at risk of prostate cancer included 47,568 cancer-free men. Our analysis of alcohol intake among men with prostate cancer was restricted to 5,182 men diagnosed with nonmetastatic prostate cancer during follow-up. We examine the association of total alcohol, red and white wine, beer, and liquor with lethal prostate cancer and death. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression estimated hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs.  Results:   Alcohol drinkers had a lower risk of lethal prostate cancer (any v none: HR, 0.84 [95% CI, 0.71 to 0.99]) without a dose-response relationship. Total alcohol intake among patients with prostate cancer was not associated with progression to lethal prostate cancer (any v none: HR, 0.99 [95% CI, 0.57 to 1.72]), whereas moderate red wine intake was associated with a lower risk (any v none: HR, 0.50 [95% CI, 0.29 to 0.86]; P trend = .05). Compared with none, 15 to 30 g/d of total alcohol after prostate cancer diagnosis was associated with a lower risk of death (HR, 0.71 [95% CI, 0.50 to 1.00]), as was red wine (any v none: HR, 0.74 [95% CI, 0.57 to 0.97]; P trend = .007).  Conclusion:   Cancer-free men who consumed alcohol had a slightly lower risk of lethal prostate cancer compared with abstainers. Among men with prostate cancer, red wine was associated with a lower risk of progression to lethal disease.

Thus, the aim of this study was to enhance the utility of the grade group system by integrating the presence of IDC-P.  Methods:   This study was a retrospective evaluation of 1019 patients with prostate cancer who underwent radical prostatectomy between 2005 and 2013 without neoadjuvant or adjuvant therapy. The data on age, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level at diagnosis, pathological T stage (pT), presence of Gleason pattern 5 (GP5), presence of IDC-P, and surgical margin status were analyzed to predict PSA recurrence after prostatectomy.  Results:   The median patient age was 67 (range, 45-80) years and the median initial PSA level was 6.8 (range, 0.4-82) ng/mL. The median follow-up period was 82 (range, 0.7-148) months. IDC-P was detected in 157 patients (15.4%). Among these patients, the increase in the positive rate of IDC-P correlated with tumor upgrading. The grade groups (GGs) were as follows: GG1 without IDC-P, 16.0% (n = 163); GG2 without IDC-P, 46.1% (n = 470); GG3 without IDC-P, 15.7% (n = 160); GG4 without IDC-P, 2.6% (n = 27); GG5 without IDC-P, 4.1% (n = 42); any GG with IDC-P, 15.4% [n = 157; GG 2 (n = 29); GG3 (n = 60); GG4 (n = 13); GG5 (n = 55)]. Any grade Group with IDC-P showed significantly worse prognosis than any other group without IDC-P (P < 0.0001). In a multivariate analysis, integration of the IDC-P into the Grade Groups, the PSA level at diagnosis, and the surgical margin status were significant prognostic predictors (P < 0.0001, < 0.0001 and < 0.0001, respectively).

We prospectively evaluated the ability of pTURP to achieve tumor control in patients with mPCa. Patients and Methods: A prospective study of patients with mPCa from 2011 to 2018 was conducted. The patients were divided into two groups: a pTURP + androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) group and an ADT group. Castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC)-free survival and cancer-specific survival (CSS) were analyzed as research endpoints between the groups using a Kaplan-Meier estimator. Results: A total of 188 patients with mPCa were enrolled in the study from our center, of which 110 patients were in the pTURP + ADT group, and 78 patients were in the ADT group. The basic clinical characteristics were comparable between the groups. There were no reoperations or severe complications in the pTURP + ADT group. The median follow-up was 29 months. The median CRPC-free survival was significantly increased when the 7-month prostate-specific antigen (PSA) was <4 ng/mL (34 vs 6, p < 0.01) and bone metastasis was ≤5 (25 vs 10, p < 0.01) but not in the pTURP + ADT group (16 vs 12, p = 0.267). The 3-year CSS was higher in the pTURP + ADT group than that in the ADT group (95.9% vs 64.9%, p = 0.004), as well as when the 7-month PSA was <4 ng/mL compared to ≥4 ng/mL (90.7% vs 36.6%, p < 0.01) and when bone metastasis was ≤5 compared to >5 (82.2% vs 63.2%, p < 0.01). In subgroup analysis, pTURP + ADT could significantly improve patients' CSS when PSA ≥65 ng/mL, Gleason Score (GS) ≥8, and bone metastasis ≤5. Conclusions: We used our center-based cancer database to analyze survival in patients with mPCa undergoing pTURP.

However, during surgical procedures, it is not always possible to identify malignant tissues by visual inspection. Among the possible consequences, there is the formation of positive surgical margins, often associated with recurrence. In this work, the gastrin-releasing peptide receptor (GRPR), overexpressed in the prostatic carcinoma and not in healthy tissues or in benign hyperplasia (BPH), is proposed as target molecule to design a novel near-infrared fluorescent (NIRF) probe for image-guided prostatectomy.  Procedures:   The NIRF dye Sulfo-Cy5.5 was conjugated to a Bombesin-like peptide (BBN), targeting GRPR. The final product, called BBN-Cy5.5, was characterized and tested in vitro on PC-3, DU145, and LnCAP cell lines, using unconjugated Sulfo-Cy5.5 as control. In vivo biodistribution studies were performed by optical imaging in PC-3 tumor-bearing and healthy mice. Finally, simulation of the surgical protocol was carried out.  Results:   BBN-Cy5.5 showed high water solubility and a good relative quantum yield. The ability of the probe to recognize the GRPR, highly expressed in PC-3 cells, was tested both in vitro and in vivo, where a significant tumor accumulation was achieved 24 h post-injection. Furthermore, a distinguishable fluorescent signal was visible in mice bearing PCa, when the surgery was simulated. By contrast, low signal was found in healthy or BPH-affected mice.  Conclusions:   This work proposes a new NIRF probe ideal to target GRPR, biomarker of PCa. The promising data obtained suggest that the dye could allow the real-time intraoperative visualization of prostate cancer.""","""['Amerigo Pagoto', 'Francesca Garello', 'Giada Maria Marini', 'Martina Tripepi', 'Francesca Arena', 'Paola Bardini', 'Rachele Stefania', 'Stefania Lanzardo', 'Giovanni Valbusa', 'Francesco Porpiglia', 'Matteo Manfredi', 'Silvio Aime', 'Enzo Terreno']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Mol Imaging Biol""","""['Synthesis and biological evaluation of copper-64 radiolabeled DUPA-6-Ahx-(NODAGA)-5-Ava-BBN(7-14)NH2, a novel bivalent targeting vector having affinity for two distinct biomarkers (GRPr/PSMA) of prostate cancer.', 'Near-infrared fluorescence imaging of gastrin releasing peptide receptor targeting in prostate cancer lymph node metastases.', 'First-in-human study of PET and optical dual-modality image-guided surgery in glioblastoma using 68Ga-IRDye800CW-BBN.', 'Prostate Cancer Theranostics Targeting Gastrin-Releasing Peptide Receptors.', 'Peptide receptor imaging of prostate cancer with radiolabelled bombesin analogues.', 'Pre- and Intraoperative Visualization of GRPR-Expressing Solid Tumors: Preclinical Profiling of Novel Dual-Modality Probes for Nuclear and Fluorescence Imaging.', 'A Novel PSMA-Targeted Probe for NIRF-Guided Surgery and Photodynamic Therapy: Synthesis and Preclinical Validation.', 'Red Upconverter Nanocrystals Functionalized with Verteporfin for Photodynamic Therapy Triggered by Upconversion.', 'Assessment and Comparison of Three Dimensional Exoscopes for Near-Infrared Fluorescence-Guided Surgery Using Second-Window Indocyanine-Green.', 'Towards Complete Tumor Resection: Novel Dual-Modality Probes for Improved Image-Guided Surgery of GRPR-Expressing Prostate Cancer.']"""

Methods:   The study retrospectively enrolled 49 PCa patients who had undergone preoperative multiparametric MRI (mpMRI) and 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT, and who had Gleason pattern (GP) 4 and absence of GP 5 on radical prostatectomy specimens. Lesions with GP 4 were outlined and stratified according to their cribriform status. Volumes of interest were drawn on matched mpMRI and PET images, and parameters including average apparent diffusion coefficient (ADCmean), tenth percentile ADC (ADC10%) and maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) were derived. The Mann-Whitney U test was used for continuous variables and the chi-squared test for categorical variables. Receiver operating characteristic analysis was used to compare imaging parameters in identifying cribriform morphology. The associations between cribriform-positive PCa and imaging variables were evaluated in a univariate analysis using a logistic regression model.  Results:   A total of 62 lesions were identified in 49 patients with GP 4. Of these lesions, 37 (59.7%) in 34 patients (69.4%) showed cribriform morphology. ADCmean and ADC10% were similar between cribriform-positive and non-cribriform groups (P > 0.05), while SUVmax was significantly different (median SUVmax 18.3 vs. 9.4 per patient, P = 0.003, 18.2 vs. 7.2 per lesion, P < 0.001), yielding sensitivities and specificities of 76% and 86% in a per-patient analysis, and 77% and 88% in a per-lesion analysis, respectively. Further, PSMA was significantly overexpressed in cribriform-positive PCa (P = 0.003). SUVmax was a significant predictor of cribriform morphology in PCa (odds ratio 8.61, 95% confidence interval 4.96-25.27, per patient; odds ratio 11.93, 95% confidence interval 6.49-33.74, per lesion; both P < 0.001).

We assessed the course of these conditions in patients receiving abiraterone in clinical practice and compared outcomes with those in clinical trials.  Materials and methods:   Medical records of patients with mCRPC who started abiraterone at an academic institution between 2012 and 2015 were reviewed for emergency department (ED) visits, hospitalizations, and the development and/or worsening of key comorbid conditions while on abiraterone. Patient characteristics and adverse events were compared with those from clinical trials.  Results:   In a cohort of 174 patients, 28% experienced either the development or worsening of a comorbid disease; 8% required an ED visit or hospitalization owing to known adverse effects of abiraterone. Increasing age (odds ratio [OR], 1.08; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.01-1.17), higher prostate-specific antigen at initiation of treatment (OR, 1.68; 95% CI, 1.18-2.47), preexisting uncontrolled hypertension (OR, 7.61; 95% CI, 1.22-38.70), congestive heart failure (OR, 7.61; 95% CI, 1.22-38.70), and cardiac arrhythmias (OR, 4.73; 95% CI, 1.39-15.12) were associated with increased odds of an ED visit or hospitalization owing to known adverse effects of abiraterone. The rate of discontinuation (6%) was similar to 1 phase III trial that demonstrated the drug's efficacy in chemotherapy-naive patients.

Our previous studies showed that salinomycin inhibited cell growth and targeted CSCs in prostate cancer. However, the precise target of salinomycin action is unclear.  Methods:   In this work, we analyzed and identified differentially expressed genes (DEGs) after treatment with or without salinomycin using a gene expression microarray in vitro (PC-3 cells) and in vivo (NOD/SCID mice xenograft model generated from implanted PC-3 cells). Western blotting and immunohistochemical staining were used to analyze the expression of ATP2A3 and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress biomarkers. Flow cytometry was used to analyze the cell cycle, apoptosis and intracellular Ca2+ concentration.  Results:   A significantly upregulated gene, ATPase sarcoplasmatic/endoplasmatic reticulum Ca2+ transporting 3 (ATP2A3), was successfully identified. In subsequent studies, we found that ATP2A3 overexpression could trigger ER stress and exert anti-cancer effects in PC-3 and DU145 cells. ATP2A3 was slightly expressed, but the ER stress biomarkers showed strong staining in prostate cancer tissues. We also found that salinomycin could trigger ER stress, which might be related to ATP2A3-mediated Ca2+ release in PC-3 cells. Furthermore, we found that salinomycin-triggered ER stress could promote apoptosis and thus exert anti-cancer effects in prostate cancer cells.  Conclusion:   This study demonstrates that ATP2A3 might be one of the potential targets for salinomycin, which can inhibit Ca2+ release and trigger ER stress to exert anti-cancer effects.""","""['Yunsheng Zhang', 'Fang Li', 'Luogen Liu', 'Hongtao Jiang', 'Hua Hu', 'Xiaobo Du', 'Xin Ge', 'Jingsong Cao', 'Yi Wang']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""BMC Cancer""","""['Corosolic acid, a natural triterpenoid, induces ER stress-dependent apoptosis in human castration resistant prostate cancer cells via activation of IRE-1/JNK, PERK/CHOP and TRIB3.', 'Salinomycin induces endoplasmic reticulum stress‑mediated autophagy and apoptosis through generation of reactive oxygen species in human glioma U87MG cells.', 'Salinomycin Exerts Anticancer Effects on PC-3 Cells and PC-3-Derived Cancer Stem Cells In Vitro and In Vivo.', 'Anticancer Activity of Polyether Ionophore-Salinomycin.', 'Anticancer Mechanisms of Salinomycin in Breast Cancer and Its Clinical Applications.', 'A risk score model based on endoplasmic reticulum stress related genes for predicting prognostic value of osteosarcoma.', 'Establishment of a 7-gene prognostic signature based on oxidative stress genes for predicting chemotherapy resistance in pancreatic cancer.', 'Molecular mechanism and diagnostic marker investigation of endoplasmic reticulum stress on periodontitis.', 'A novel defined risk signature of endoplasmic reticulum stress-related genes for predicting the prognosis and immune infiltration status of ovarian cancer.', 'The endoplasmic reticulum stress response in prostate cancer.']"""

Ninety-one subjects (Group 1: >69 years; Group 2: ≤69) histopathologically diagnosed with PCa were tested. Total CHOL, triglycerides (TG), high-density lipoprotein (HDL), low density lipoprotein (LDL), and very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) were assessed from blood taken before the entire course of radiotherapy (RT) and in 3-month intervals after the treatment was completed, for up to 4 years (range: palliative and radical). In all the subjects, the CHOL decreased over time after RT ( p = .0445) with a simultaneous increase of prostate specific antigen (PSA) concentration ( p = .0366). A faster decrease of HDL was observed with a higher concentration of PSA ( p = .0053) and Gleason score ( p = .0304). In all the subjects, the HDL decreased after RT ( p = .0159) but in the older palliative group the HDL decrease progressed more slowly ( p = .0141).

It is currently recognised that a constant RBE of 1.1 is not consistent with radiobiological experiment and may lead to sub-optimal exploitation of the benefits of proton therapy. To overcome this problem, several RBE models have been developed, and in most of these models, there is a dependence of RBE on dose-averaged linear energy transfer (LET), [Formula: see text]. In this work, we show that the [Formula: see text] estimation in these models during the data-fitting (or parameter estimation) phase could be subjected to a huge uncertainty due to not taking into account cellular materials during simulation, and this uncertainty can propagate down to the resulting RBE models. The dosimetric impact of this [Formula: see text] uncertainty is then evaluated on a simple clinical spread out Bragg peak (SOBP) and a prostate example. Our simulation shows that [Formula: see text] uncertainty due to the use of water as cellular material is non-negligible under low [Formula: see text] and low dose (2 Gy), and can be neglected otherwise. Thus, this study indicates that further dose and range margins may be required for low [Formula: see text] target under low dose.

However, developing such automatic solutions remains very challenging due to the missing/ambiguous boundary and inhomogeneous intensity distribution of the prostate in TRUS, as well as the large variability in prostate shapes. This paper develops a novel 3D deep neural network equipped with attention modules for better prostate segmentation in TRUS by fully exploiting the complementary information encoded in different layers of the convolutional neural network (CNN). Our attention module utilizes the attention mechanism to selectively leverage the multi-level features integrated from different layers to refine the features at each individual layer, suppressing the non-prostate noise at shallow layers of the CNN and increasing more prostate details into features at deep layers. Experimental results on challenging 3D TRUS volumes show that our method attains satisfactory segmentation performance. The proposed attention mechanism is a general strategy to aggregate multi-level deep features and has the potential to be used for other medical image segmentation tasks.

LuPSMA is considered as an experimental treatment not yet used in routine practice. Here, we report our experience following the introduction of LuPSMA therapy at our institution.  Methods:   Referred mCRPC patients were assessed for treatment suitability including Gallium-68-PSMA PET/CT and blood tests. Suitable patients underwent up to four cycles of LuPSMA treatment. Response to treatment was assessed by changes in serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels. Toxicity was assessed by recording of adverse events.  Results:   In an 18 month period, 50 patients underwent 132 cycles of LuPSMA therapy. Patients underwent a median of three cycles each (range: 1-4) and the mean administered amount of activity per cycle was 5.9 GBq (range: 3.5-8.2 GBq). PSA decline could be calculated for 49 patients, with a best PSA decline of ≥ 50% observed in 22 patients (44.9%). Adverse events were reported across 45 of 132 LuPSMA cycles. Most adverse events were grade I (42/45) and the remaining three events were grade II.  Conclusion:   Initial experience at our site supports the use of LuPSMA as an emerging safe and effective treatment for mCRPC. Since introducing LuPSMA therapy at our institution, 44.9% of patients have experienced a decline in PSA level ≥ 50% with low or minimal toxicity. This is an important finding as these patients had previously exhausted all available treatment options. Overall, we have found patients and their primary care doctors have eagerly accepted LuPSMA as another line of defence against mCRPC.""","""['Rhiannon McBean', ""Brooke O'Kane"", 'Rex Parsons', 'David Wong']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""J Med Imaging Radiat Oncol""","""['177Lu-PSMA-617 radionuclide treatment in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (LuPSMA trial): a single-centre, single-arm, phase 2 study.', 'Outcome of 177 Lu-PSMA Radionuclide Treatment in Advanced Prostate Cancer and Its Association With Clinical Parameters : A Single-Center Experience.', '177LuLu-PSMA-617 versus cabazitaxel in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (TheraP): a randomised, open-label, phase 2 trial.', 'Prostate-specific membrane antigen-targeted endoradiotherapy in metastatic prostate cancer.', 'Lutetium-177-labelled anti-prostate-specific membrane antigen antibody and ligands for the treatment of metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Joint EANM/SNMMI procedure guideline for the use of 177Lu-labeled PSMA-targeted radioligand-therapy (177Lu-PSMA-RLT).', '177Lu-PSMA Therapy for Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer: A Mini-Review of State-of-the-Art.', 'A Review of 177Lutetium-PSMA and 225Actinium-PSMA as Emerging Theranostic Agents in Prostate Cancer.', 'Clinical Applications of PSMA PET Examination in Patients with Prostate Cancer.', '177 Lu-PSMA radioligand therapy effectiveness in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer: An updated systematic review and meta-analysis.']"""

The objective of this study was to assess the effect of a cancer diagnosis on the risk of suicide, accounting for prediagnosis psychiatric care utilization.  Methods:   All adult residents of Ontario, Canada who were diagnosed with cancer (1 of prostate, breast, colorectal, melanoma, lung, bladder, endometrial, thyroid, kidney, or oral cancer) between 1997 and 2014 were identified. Noncancer controls were matched 4:1 based on sociodemographics, including a psychiatric utilization gradient (PUG) score (with 0 indicating none; 1, outpatient; 2, emergency department; and 3, hospital admission). A marginal, cause-specific hazard model was used to assess the effect of cancer on the risk of suicidal death.  Results:   Among 676,470 patients with cancer and 2,152,682 matched noncancer controls, there were 8.2 and 11.4 suicides per 1000 person-years of follow-up, respectively. Patients with cancer had an overall higher risk of suicidal death compared with matched patients without cancer (hazard ratio, 1.34; 95% CI, 1.22-1.48). This effect was pronounced in the first 50 months after cancer diagnosis (hazard ratio, 1.60; 95% CI, 1.42-1.81); patients with cancer did not demonstrate an increased risk thereafter. Among individuals with a PUG score 0 or 1, those with cancer were significantly more likely to die of suicide compared with controls. There was no difference in suicide risk between patients with cancer and controls for those who had a PUG score of 2 or 3.  Conclusions:   A cancer diagnosis is associated with increased risk of death from suicide compared with the general population even after accounting for precancer diagnosis psychiatric care utilization. The specific factors underlying the observed associations remain to be elucidated.""","""['Zachary Klaassen', 'Christopher J D Wallis', 'Thenappan Chandrasekar', 'Hanan Goldberg', 'Rashid K Sayyid', 'Stephen B Williams', 'Kelvin A Moses', 'Martha K Terris', 'Robert K Nam', 'David Urbach', 'Peter C Austin', 'Paul Kurdyak', 'Girish S Kulkarni']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Cancer""","""['The impact of psychiatric utilisation prior to cancer diagnosis on survival of solid organ malignancies.', 'Migraine headache and risk of self-harm and suicide: A population-based study in Ontario, Canada.', 'Short-term Suicide Risk After Psychiatric Hospital Discharge.', 'Prevention of suicide and attempted suicide in Denmark.

In this proof-of-concept study, we established a human PCa cell line from a prostatectomy surgical specimen without the need for retroviral transduction. In a previous report, we characterized the stromal cells derived from PCa specimens. Here, we characterized the epithelial cells isolated from the same tumors. Compared to the ease of establishing prostate stromal cell lines, prostatic epithelial cell lines are challenging. From three matched pairs of normal and tumor tissues, we established one new PCa cell line, HPE-15. We confirmed the origin of HPE-15 cells by short tandem repeat microsatellite polymorphism analysis. HPE-15 cells are androgen-insensitive and express marginal androgen receptor, prostate-specific antigen and prostate-specific membrane antigen proteins. HPE-15 expresses luminal epithelial markers of E-cadherin and cytokeratin 18, basal cell markers of cytokeratin 5 and p63 and neuroendocrine marker of chromogranin A. Interestingly, HPE-15 Cells exhibited no tumorigenicity in different strains of immune-deficient mice but can become tumorigenic through interaction with aggressive cancer cell types.

Methods: In total, 701 patients with prostate cancer who underwent 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT were evaluated retrospectively. All patients underwent additional lower-limb imaging. Images were reanalyzed by experienced nuclear medicine physicians, and metastatic sites were documented. The prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level and Gleason score were also compared with 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT findings. Results: In 601 patients (85.7%), at least 1 tumoral lesion was observed on 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT. The number of patients with bone metastasis in 2 forms was 278 patients (39.6%); 108 (15.4%) were oligometastatic (<4 metastases) and 170 (24.2%) were multimetastatic (≥4 metastases). In lower-limb imaging, bone metastasis was detected in 61 patients (8.7%), the specific locations of which were as follows: middle-distal femur (n = 54), tibia (n = 19), fibula (n = 24), and calcaneus (n = 1). Lower-limb metastasis was detected mostly in symptom-positive patients (70.1%) but in only 4% of the symptom-negative group. All patients with lower-extremity metastasis also had multiple bone metastases shown on limited whole-body 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT. The median PSA level was significantly higher in multimetastatic patients with lower-limb metastasis than in those without lower-limb metastasis (P < 0.001, Mann-Whitney U test), but no statistical differences was found in terms of Gleason score (χ2 = 0.042, P = 0.837). According to receiver-operating-characteristic analysis, PSA has a good predictive value for detecting lower-limb metastasis, with 76.6% sensitivity and 72% specificity (using a reference cutoff PSA level of 24 ng/mL [area under the curve, 0.81; 95% confidence interval, 0.74-0.87]).

Studies have shown their association with prostate cancer (PCa) risk through single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), known as miRSNPs. In a European cohort, 22 PCa risk-associated miRSNPs have been identified. The most significant miRSNP in the 3' UTR of Kallikrein-related peptidase 3 (KLK3) created a binding site for miR-3162-5p. Here we investigated the miR-3162-5p-KLK interaction and the clinical implication of miR-3162-5p in PCa.  Methods:   We tested the role of miR-3162-5p in PCa etiology using IncuCyte live-cell imaging and anchorage-independent growth assays. The effect of miR-3162-5p on KLK and androgen receptor (AR) expression was measured by RT-quantitative (q)PCR and target pulldown assays. KLK3 proteolytic activity was determined by DELFIA® immunoassay. Mass spectrometry identified pathways affected by miR-3162-5p. miR-3162-5p expression was measured in clinical samples using RT-qPCR.  Results:   miR-3162-5p affected proliferation, migration, and colony formation of LNCaP cells by regulating the expression of KLK2-4 and AR by direct targeting. KLK3 protein expression was regulated by miR-3162-5p consistent with lower KLK3 proteolytic activity observed in LNCaP-conditioned media. KLK/AR pulldown and mass spectrometry analysis showed a potential role of miR-3162-5p in metabolic pathways via KLK/AR and additional targets. Increased miR-3162-5p expression was observed in prostate tumor tissues with higher Gleason grade.  Conclusions:   Our study provides an insight into possible involvement of miR-3162-5p in PCa etiology by targeting KLKs and AR.

The aim of our project was to test the impact of adjuvant radiotherapy (ART) in patients with localized to locally advanced prostate cancer (PC) and IDC-P.  Materials and methods:   We performed a retrospective study of men with pT2-T3 PC treated by radical prostatectomy (RP) with or without ART, from two centres (1993-2015). Exclusion criteria were the use of another type of treatment prior to biochemical recurrence (BCR), and detectable prostate- specific antigen (PSA) following RP or ART. Primary outcome was BCR (2 consecutive PSA ≥ 0.2 ng/ml). Patients were grouped by treatment (RPonly/RP + ART), IDC-P status, and presence of high-risk features (HRF: Grade Groups 4-5, positive margins, pT3 stage).  Results:   We reviewed 293 RP specimens (median follow-up 99 months, 69 BCR). Forty-eight patients (16.4%) were treated by RP + ART. Multivariate Cox regression for BCR indicated that IDC-P had the strongest impact (hazard ratio [HR] = 2.39, 95% confidence interval [CI]:1.44-3.97), while ART reduced the risk of BCR (HR = 0.38, 95%CI: 0.17-0.85). Other HRF were all significant except for pT3b stage. IDC-P[+] patients who did not receive ART had the worst BCR-free survival (log-rank P = 0.023).

The effect of graphene oxide-green platinum nanoparticles (GO-PtNPs) on human prostate cancer cells (LNCaP) is unclear. Therefore, this study aimed to synthesize a nanocomposite of GO-PtNPs and evaluate their effect on prostate cancer cells. Herein, we synthesized GO-PtNPs using vanillin and characterized GO-PtNPs. GO-PtNP cytotoxicity in LNCaP cells was demonstrated by measuring cell viability and proliferation. Both decreased in a dose-dependent manner compared to that by GO or PtNPs alone. GO-PtNP cytotoxicity was confirmed by increased lactate dehydrogenase release and membrane integrity loss. Oxidative stress induced by GO-PtNPs increased malondialdehyde, nitric oxide, and protein carbonyl contents. The effective reactive oxygen species generation impaired the cellular redox balance and eventually impaired mitochondria by decreasing the membrane potential and ATP level. The cytotoxicity to LNCaP cells was correlated with increased expression of proapoptotic genes (p53, p21, Bax, Bak, caspase 9, and caspase 3) and decreased levels of antiapoptotic genes (Bcl2 and Bcl-xl). Activation of the key regulators p53 and p21 inhibited the cyclin-dependent kinases Cdk2 and Cdk4, suggesting that p53 and p21 activation in GO-PtNP-treated cells caused genotoxic stress and apoptosis. The increased expression of genes involved in cell cycle arrest and DNA damage and repair, and increased levels of 8-oxo-deoxyguanosine and 8-oxoguanine suggested that GO-PtNPs potentially induce oxidative damage to DNA. Thus, GO-PtNPs are both cytotoxic and genotoxic. LNCaP cells appear to be more susceptible to GO-PtNPs than to GO or PtNPs. Therefore, GO-PtNPs have potential as an alternate and effective cancer therapeutic agent. Finally, this work shows that the combination of graphene oxide with platinum nanoparticles opens new perspectives in cancer therapy. However further detailed mechanistic studies are required to elucidate the molecular mechanism of GO-PtNPs induced cytotoxicity in prostate cancer.""","""['Sangiliyandi Gurunathan', 'Muniyandi Jeyaraj', 'Min-Hee Kang', 'Jin-Hoi Kim']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Polymers (Basel)""","""['Anisotropic Platinum Nanoparticle-Induced Cytotoxicity, Apoptosis, Inflammatory Response, and Transcriptomic and Molecular Pathways in Human Acute Monocytic Leukemia Cells.', 'Anticancer Properties of Platinum Nanoparticles and Retinoic Acid: Combination Therapy for the Treatment of Human Neuroblastoma Cancer.', 'The Effects of Apigenin-Biosynthesized Ultra-Small Platinum Nanoparticles on the Human Monocytic THP-1 Cell Line.', 'A systematic review of p53 regulation of oxidative stress in skeletal muscle.', 'Platinum Nanoparticles in Biomedicine: Preparation, Anti-Cancer Activity, and Drug Delivery Vehicles.', 'Role of green synthesized platinum nanoparticles in cytotoxicity, oxidative stress, and apoptosis of human colon cancer cells (HCT-116).', 'Graphene Oxide Enhances Biogenesis and Release of Exosomes in Human Ovarian Cancer Cells.', 'Synthesis of Water-Dispersed Sulfobetaine Methacrylate-Iron Oxide Nanoparticle-Coated Graphene Composite by Free Radical Polymerization.', 'Functionalized Platinum Nanoparticles with Biomedical Applications.', 'Magnetic Graphene-Based Nanosheets with Pluronic F127-Chitosan Biopolymers Encapsulated α-Mangosteen Drugs for Breast Cancer Cells Therapy.']"""

The aim of this study was to investigate whether a change in the localisation of receptors out of caveolae and onto the cell membrane increased cell proliferation invitro, and to determine whether this is related to changes in the cell signalling pathways. Normal human prostate epithelial cells (PrEC) and androgen-independent (PC3) cancer cells were cultured with 10nM dihydrotestosterone (DHT). The effects of oxytocin (OT) and gonadal steroids on proliferation were assessed using the MTS assay. Androgen receptor (AR) and oxytocin receptor (OTR) expression was identified by immunofluorescence and quantified by western blot. OTR and lipid raft staining was determined using Pearson's correlation coefficient. Protein-protein interactions were detected and the cell signalling pathways identified. Treatment with OT did not affect the proliferation of PrEC. In PC3 cells, OT or androgen alone increased cell proliferation, but together had no effect. In normal cells, OTR localised to the membrane and AR localised to the nucleus, whereas in malignant cells both OTR and AR were identified in the cell membrane. Colocalisation of OTR and AR increased following treatment with androgens. Significantly fewer OTR/AR protein-protein interactions were seen in PrEC. With OT treatment, several cell signalling pathways were activated.

In the current study, the authors tested the association between hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) and long-term PC outcomes among diabetic men undergoing radical prostatectomy (RP).  Methods:   The authors retrospectively reviewed data regarding men undergoing RP from 2000 to 2017 at 8 Veterans Affairs hospitals. Diabetic patients were identified using International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) codes (250.x) or by an HbA1c value >6.5% at any time before RP. Cox models tested the association between HbA1c and biochemical disease recurrence (BCR), castration-resistant PC (CRPC), metastases, PC-specific mortality, and all-cause mortality. The model for BCR was adjusted for multiple variables. Due to limited events, models for long-term outcomes were adjusted for biopsy grade and prostate-specific antigen only.  Results:   A total of 1409 men comprised the study population. Of these, 699 patients (50%) had an HbA1c value <6.5%, 631 (45%) had an HbA1c value of 6.5% to 7.9%, and 79 (6%) had an HbA1c value ≥8.0%. Men with an HbA1c value ≥8.0% were younger (P < .001) and more likely to be black (P = .013). The median follow-up after RP was 6.8 years (interquartile range, 3.7-10.6 years). On multivariable analysis, HbA1c was not found to be associated with BCR. However, a higher HbA1c value was associated with metastasis (hazard ratio [HR], 1.21; 95% CI, 1.02-1.44 [P = .031]) and CRPC (HR, 1.27; 95% CI, 1.03-1.56 [P = .023]). Although not statistically significant, there were trends between higher HbA1c and risk of PC-specific mortality (HR, 1.24; 95% CI, 0.99-1.56 [P = .067]) and all-cause mortality (HR, 1.09; 95% CI, 0.99-1.19 [P = .058]).

In this report, a dual targeting PET agent was developed to partially address the tumor heterogeneity issue. The heterodimer F-BCN-PSMA-NT was designed to target PSMA and neurotensin receptor1 (NTR1), both of which have demonstrated great potential in prostate cancer management. The heterodimer was synthesized through the conjugation of Glu-urea-lys(Ahx) (PSMA targeting motif) and NT20.3 (NTR1 targeting motif) to a symmetric trifunctional linker, bearing an azide group for further modification. Radio-labeling was performed using strain promoted azide-alkyne click reaction with high yield. Cell based assays suggested that F-BCN-PSMA-NT has comparable or only slightly reduced binding affinity with the corresponding monomers. Small animal PET clearly demonstrated that the heterodimer probe has prominent uptake not only in NTR1 positive/PSMA negative PC-3 tumors (1.4 ± 0.3%ID/g), but also in the PSMA positive/NTR1 negative LnCap tumors (1.3 ± 0.2%ID/g). The tracer showed comparable tumor to background ratio with each monomer. In summary, prostate cancer is a heterogeneous disease in need of improved diagnostics and treatments. The PSMA-NT heterodimer represents a new class of molecules that can be used to target two distinct antigens related to prostate cancer. In addition to the imaging applications demonstrated in this study, the agent also holds great potential on the treatment of heterogeneous prostate cancer.""","""['Xiaofen Ma', 'Mengzhe Wang', 'Hui Wang', 'Tao Zhang', 'Zhanhong Wu', 'Mariia V Sutton', 'Vladimir V Popik', 'Guihua Jiang', 'Zibo Li']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Bioconjug Chem""","""['Preclinical evaluation of a bispecific low-molecular heterodimer targeting both PSMA and GRPR for improved PET imaging and therapy of prostate cancer.', 'Preclinical Evaluation and Pilot Clinical Study of Al18F-PSMA-BCH for Prostate Cancer PET Imaging.', 'Synthesis and pre-clinical evaluation of a new class of high-affinity 18F-labeled PSMA ligands for detection of prostate cancer by PET imaging.', 'Current use of PSMA-PET in prostate cancer management.', 'Current application and future perspectives of prostate specific membrane antigen PET imaging in prostate cancer.', 'Theranostics of Primary Prostate Cancer: Beyond PSMA and GRP-R.', 'Clinical advancement of precision theranostics in prostate cancer.', 'Synthesis and Preclinical Evaluation of Three Novel 68Ga-Labeled Bispecific PSMA/FAP-Targeting Tracers for Prostate Cancer Imaging.', 'Image-guided selection of Gd@C-dots as sensitizers to improve radiotherapy of non-small cell lung cancer.', 'Ditelluride-Bridged PEG-PCL Copolymer as Folic Acid-Targeted and Redox-Responsive Nanoparticles for Enhanced Cancer Therapy.']"""

Even in a small subpopulation, CSCs may have an influence on tumor control probability, represented by cell killing after irradiation. However, the relationship between the percentage content of CSCs and the cell survival dose-response curve has not yet been quantitatively clarified. In this study, we developed a cell-killing model for two cell populations (CSCs and progeny cells) to predict the surviving fractions, and compared it with the conventional linear-quadratic (LQ) model. Three prostate cancer cell lines (DU145, PC3 and LNCaP) were exposed to X-rays at doses ranging from 0 to 10 Gy. After the irradiation, we performed clonogenic survival assays to generate the cell survival curves, and carried out flow-cytometric analyses to estimate the percentage content of CSCs for each cell line. The cell survival curves for DU145 cells and PC3 cells seemed not to follow the conventional LQ model in the high dose range (>8 Gy). However, the outputs of the developed model agreed better with the experimental cell survival curves than those of the LQ model. The percentage content of CSCs predicted by the developed model was almost coincident with the measured percentage content for both DU145 cells and PC3 cells. The experiments and model analyses indicate that a small subpopulation of radioresistant CSCs has lower radiosensitivity in the high-dose range, which may lessen the clinical outcome for patients with prostate cancer after high-dose radiation therapy.""","""['Ryo Saga', 'Yusuke Matsuya', 'Rei Takahashi', 'Kazuki Hasegawa', 'Hiroyuki Date', 'Yoichiro Hosokawa']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""J Radiat Res""","""['Incorporating cancer stem cells in radiation therapy treatment response modeling and the implication in glioblastoma multiforme treatment resistance.', 'Radiosensitivity of Prostate Cancer Cell Lines for Irradiation from Beta Particle-emitting Radionuclide ¹⁷⁷Lu Compared to Alpha Particles and Gamma Rays.', 'Radioresistance of the breast tumor is highly correlated to its level of cancer stem cell and its clinical implication for breast irradiation.', 'Radiosensitivity of human cell lines to small doses.

Prostate cancer has traditionally been diagnosed via transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) biopsy. Though considered the gold standard, TRUS is unable to visualize most prostate cancer lesions and therefore requires sampling of the entire prostate. This biopsy method often undergrades prostate cancer and fails to detect up to 35% of cancers on initial biopsy. Prostate MRI has been shown to have excellent sensitivity in the detection of cancerous lesions, and advancements in MRI technology during the last decade have led to the development of targeted biopsy. In targeted biopsy, a software platform overlays MRI data onto live TRUS images to create a fused MRI/US three-dimensional model of the prostate. Regions suspicious for malignancy on MRI are contoured by a radiologist, uploaded into the fusion system, and then displayed within the live MRI/US fused model. The urologist is then able to directly biopsy these targets. When compared to conventional TRUS biopsy, MRI/US fusion technology has been demonstrated to improve the detection of clinically significant cancer while reducing insignificant cancer detection. This technology, therefore, has the potential to diagnose prostate cancer primarily in men who would benefit from treatment.""","""['Rajiv Jayadevan', 'Steve Zhou', 'Alan M Priester', 'Merdie Delfin', 'Leonard S Marks']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""J Vis Exp""","""['An initial negative round of targeted biopsies in men with highly suspicious multiparametric magnetic resonance findings does not exclude clinically significant prostate cancer-Preliminary experience.', 'Magnetic resonance imaging-targeted, 3D transrectal ultrasound-guided fusion biopsy for prostate cancer: Quantifying the impact of needle delivery error on diagnosis.', 'Real-time MRI/US fusion-guided biopsy improves detection rates of prostate cancer in pre-biopsied patients.', 'Magnetic resonance imaging-targeted biopsy may enhance the diagnostic accuracy of significant prostate cancer detection compared to standard transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsy: a systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'MRI/TRUS fusion software-based targeted biopsy: the new standard of care?', 'A Pilot Study of\xa018F-DCFPyL PET/CT or PET/MRI and Ultrasound Fusion Targeted Prostate Biopsy for Intra-Prostatic PET-Positive Lesions.', 'A Quality Control System for Automated Prostate Segmentation on T2-Weighted MRI.', 'Prostate Cancer Detection Rate of Freehand versus 3-Dimensional Template Mapping Biopsy Using a Magnetic Resonance Imaging-Ultrasound Fusion Device in Biopsy Naïve Men.']"""

Such data may assist in active surveillance decisions.  Methods and results:   Men with clinically localised prostate cancer diagnosed by needle biopsy from 1990 to 2003 were included. The endpoint was prostate cancer death. Clinical variables included Gleason score (GS), prostate-specific antigen level, age, clinical stage, and disease extent. Deaths were divided into those from prostate cancer and those from other causes, according to World Health Organization criteria. Nine hundred and eighty-eight biopsy cases were centrally reviewed according to criteria agreed at the Chicago International Society of Urological Pathology conference in 2014. Cores were given individual GSs and Grade Groups (GGs), and a percentage of each grade was given for each core. Both the worst percentage of HG disease seen in a biopsy series and overall percentage of HG disease were calculated. The overall percentage of HG disease was highly significant, with a hazard ratio of 4.45 for the interquartile range (95% confidence interval 3.30-6.01, P < 2.2 × 10-16 ), and was similar to the percentage of HG disease seen in the worst core. In multivariate analysis, both were highly significant. GG2 cases with ≤5% Gleason pattern 4 showed similar survival to GG1 cases.  Conclusions:   These data validate the use of percentage of HG disease to predict prostate cancer death. As both worst and overall percentage of HG disease are powerful predictors of outcome, either could be chosen to provide prognostic information.""","""['Daniel M Berney', 'Luis Beltran', 'Holly Sandu', 'Geraldine Soosay', 'Henrik Møller', 'Peter Scardino', 'Jacqueline Murphy', 'Amar Ahmad', 'Jack Cuzick;Transatlantic Prostate Group']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Histopathology""","""['Validation of a contemporary prostate cancer grading system using prostate cancer death as outcome.', 'Contemporary Gleason Grading of Prostatic Carcinoma: An Update With Discussion on Practical Issues to Implement the 2014 International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) Consensus Conference on Gleason Grading of Prostatic Carcinoma.', 'Improving the Rotterdam European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer Risk Calculator for Initial Prostate Biopsy by Incorporating the 2014 International Society of Urological Pathology Gleason Grading and Cribriform growth.', 'Prognostic importance of Gleason 7 disease among patients treated with external beam radiation therapy for prostate cancer: results of a detailed biopsy core analysis.', 'The impact of the 2005 international society of urological pathology consensus conference on standard Gleason grading of prostatic carcinoma in needle biopsies.', 'Measuring cancer burden in prostatic needle core biopsies: simplified assessments outperform complex measurements in assessing outcome: evidence to assist pathologist efficiency and minimize datasets.', 'AI Model for Prostate Biopsies Predicts Cancer Survival.', 'Prognostic Utility of the Gleason Grading System Revisions and Histopathological Factors Beyond Gleason Grade.', 'PROSTATE-SPECIFIC ANTIGEN (PSA) VALUES IN PATIENTS WITH LOW- AND HIGH-RISK PROSTATIC ADENOCARCINOMA.', 'Prostate cancer grading, time to go back to the future.']"""

Orthotopic implantation is considered as an ideal xenograft model for CaP study, and noninvasive measurement of tumor volume changes is important for monitoring responses to anticancer therapies. In this study, the T2-weighted fast spin echo sequence magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed on a CaP orthotopic non-obese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficiency (NOD/SCID) mouse model weekly for 6 weeks post PC-3 CaP cell inoculation, and the fat signal was suppressed using a chemical shift-selective pulse. Subsequently, the MRI data were imported into the image processing software Avizo Standard and stacked into three-dimensional (3D) volumes. Our results demonstrate that MRI, combined with 3D reconstruction, is a feasible and sensitive method to assess tumor growth in a PC-3 orthotopic CaP mouse model and this established monitoring approach is promising for longitudinal observation of CaP xenograft development after anticancer therapy in vivo.

Background:   Radioactive gold nanoparticles are emerging as promising agents for cancer therapy and are being investigated to treat prostate cancer in animals. In order to use them as a new therapeutic modality to treat human prostate cancer, accurate radiation dosimetry simulations are required to estimate the energy deposition in the tumor and surrounding tissue and to establish the course of therapy for the patient.  Materials and methods:   A simple geometrical model of a human prostate was used, and the dose deposited by 198AuNPs or 199AuNPs to the tumor within the prostate as well as to the healthy tissue surrounding the prostate was calculated using the MCNP code. Water and A-150 TEP phantoms were used to simulate the soft and tumor tissues.  Results:   The results showed that the dose due to 198AuNPs or 199AuNPs, which are distributed homogenously in the tumor, had a maximal value in the tumor region and then rapidly decreased toward the prostate-tumor interface and surrounding organs. However, the dose deposited by 198Au is significantly higher than the dose deposited by 199Au in the tumor region as well as normal tissues.

Moreover, SPARC induces the expression of EMT regulatory transcription factors Snail family transcriptional repressor 1 (Snail), Snail family transcriptional repressor 2 (Slug), and zinc finger E-box binding homeobox 1 (Zeb1).

However, the impact of mpMRI on AS-related healthcare spending has not been established.  Objective:   To characterize the impact of mpMRI on AS-related Medicare expenditures.  Design, setting, and participants:   Using Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-Medicare files, we identified men ≥66 yr old with localized prostate cancer diagnosed during 2008-2013.  Outcome measures and statistical analysis:   With a validated algorithm, we classified men into AS with and without mpMRI groups. We then determined Medicare spending on AS in each group using inflation-adjusted, price-standardized Medicare payments for AS-related procedures (ie, prostate-specific antigen [PSA] tests, prostate biopsies, biopsy complications, and mpMRI). Multivariable median regression compared Medicare spending on AS for men who received mpMRI and those who did not.  Results and limitations:   We identified 9081 men on AS with a median follow-up of 45 mo (interquartile range 29-64 mo). Thirteen percent (N = 1225) received mpMRI. On multivariable median regression, receipt of mpMRI was associated with an additional $447 (95% confidence interval $409-487) in Medicare spending per year. We observed greater frequency of AS-related procedures and higher spending for identical procedures (eg, PSA or prostate biopsy) in the mpMRI group than in the non-mpMRI group (all p < 0.001).  Conclusions:   Among Medicare beneficiaries on AS, mpMRI is associated with additional annual Medicare spending. Future studies are needed to determine optimal use of mpMRI during AS to maximize value.  Patient summary:   Prostate magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) helps physicians determine which prostate cancers are aggressive and which can be monitored safely. We studied whether using MRI during prostate cancer monitoring (also called active surveillance) resulted in increased healthcare spending. There was a modest increase in spending, but this may be worthwhile if the use of MRI allows physicians to monitor prostate cancer more accurately.""","""['Liam C Macleod', 'Jonathan G Yabes', 'Mina M Fam', 'Jathin Bandari', 'Michelle Yu', 'Avinash Maganty', 'Alessandro Furlan', 'Christopher P Filson', 'Benjamin J Davies', 'Bruce L Jacobs']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Eur Urol Focus""","""['Increasing Utilization of Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging in Prostate Cancer Active Surveillance.', 'Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging Alone is Insufficient to Detect Grade Reclassification in Active Surveillance for Prostate Cancer.', 'Utility of multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging in the risk stratification of men with Grade Group 1 prostate cancer on active surveillance.', 'Prostate Indeterminate Lesions on Magnetic Resonance Imaging-Biopsy Versus Surveillance: A Literature Review.', 'The role of multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging in the selection and follow-up of patients undergoing active surveillance for prostate cancer.

An estimated 4.3 million new cancer cases and 2.9 million new cancer deaths occurred in China in 2018. Compared to the USA and UK, China has lower cancer incidence but a 30% and 40% higher cancer mortality than the UK and USA, among which 36.4% of the cancer-related deaths were from the digestive tract cancers (stomach, liver, and esophagus cancer) and have relatively poorer prognoses. In comparison, the digestive cancer deaths only took up ≤ 5% of the total cancer deaths in either USA or UK. Other reasons for the higher mortality in China may be the low rate of early-stage cancers at diagnosis and non-uniformed clinical cancer treatment strategies performed by different regions. China is undergoing the cancer transition stage where the cancer spectrum is changing from developing country to developed country, with a rapidly increase cancer burden of colorectal, prostate, female breast cancers in addition to a high occurrence of infection-related and digestive cancers. The incidence of westernized lifestyle-related cancers in China (i.e. colorectal cancer, prostate, bladder cancer) has risen but the incidence of the digestive cancers has decreased from 2000 to 2011. An estimated 40% of the risk factors can be attributed to environmental and lifestyle factors either in China or other developed countries. Tobacco smoking is the single most important carcinogenic risk factor in China, contributing to ~ 24.5% of cancers in males. Chronic infection is another important preventable cancer contributor which is responsible for ~ 17% of cancers. Comprehensive prevention and control strategies in China should include effective tobacco-control policy, recommendations for healthier lifestyles, along with enlarging the coverage of effective screening, educating, and vaccination programs to better sensitize greater awareness control to the general public.""","""['Rui-Mei Feng', 'Yi-Nan Zong', 'Su-Mei Cao', 'Rui-Hua Xu']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Cancer Commun (Lond)""","""['Cancer incidence, mortality, and burden in China: a time-trend analysis and comparison with the United States and United Kingdom based on the global epidemiological data released in 2020.', 'Global cancer statistics, 2012.', 'Cancer statistics in China and United States, 2022: profiles, trends, and determinants.', 'Epidemiology of cancer in the United States.', 'The Changing Global Burden of Cancer: Transitions in Human Development and Implications for Cancer Prevention and Control.', 'A bioinformatics approach to identify a disulfidptosis-related gene signature for prognostic implication in colon adenocarcinoma.', 'The disparities in prognostic prediction and annualized hazard function in different molecular subtypes between young Chinese and White American women with breast cancer.', 'Comparison of Magnetic Resonance Imaging-Based Radiomics Features with Nomogram for Prediction of Prostate Cancer Invasion.', 'Efficacy and safety of Xian-Lian-Jie-Du optimization decoction as an adjuvant treatment for prevention of recurrence in patients with stage IIIB/IIIC colon cancer: study protocol for a multicentre, randomized controlled trial.', 'From Bench to Bedside: What Do We Know about Imidazothiazole Derivatives So Far?']"""

We hypothesize that 3 elements of urologist practice structure may influence spending for prostate cancer care: urologist participation within a multispecialty group (MSG), practice size among single specialty urology groups, and intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) ownership.  Materials and methods:   We used a 20% sample of fee-for-service Medicare beneficiaries to identify men newly diagnosed with prostate cancer between 2011 and 2014. We identified each man's urologist and used data from the Healthcare Relational Spheres provider files to identify practice type, size, and IMRT ownership for each urologist. We then fit generalized linear mixed models to estimate the association between these practice features and Medicare payments in the year after diagnosis. All models were adjusted for patient and healthcare market characteristics.  Results:   We identified 35,929 men with newly diagnosed prostate cancer who were treated by 6381 urologists. Medicare payments for men with newly diagnosed prostate cancer were significantly lower in MSGs ($19,181 v. $22,366 large single specialty group, P < 0.001) and significantly higher among practices with IMRT ownership ($23,801 v. $20,162 for non-owners, P < 0.001). These differences persisted in sensitivity analyses including only men treated with radiotherapy and examining only prostate cancer-related claims.  Conclusion:   Urologist practice structure is associated with payments for prostate cancer care.

Often, these regulatory roles are a direct by-product of their close sequence homology to protein-coding genes. Novel pseudogene-gene (PGG) functional associations can be identified through the integration of biomedical data, such as sequence homology, functional pathways, gene expression, pseudogene expression, and microRNA expression. However, not all of the information has been integrated, and almost all previous pseudogene studies relied on 1:1 pseudogene-parent gene relationships without leveraging other homologous genes/pseudogenes.  Results:   We produce PGG families that expand beyond the current 1:1 paradigm. First, we construct expansive PGG databases by (i) CUDAlign graphics processing unit (GPU) accelerated local alignment of all pseudogenes to gene families (totaling 1.6 billion individual local alignments and >40,000 GPU hours) and (ii) BLAST-based assignment of pseudogenes to gene families. Second, we create an open-source web application (PseudoFuN [Pseudogene Functional Networks]) to search for integrative functional relationships of sequence homology, microRNA expression, gene expression, pseudogene expression, and gene ontology. We produce four ""flavors"" of CUDAlign-based databases (>462,000,000 PGG pairwise alignments and 133,770 PGG families) that can be queried and downloaded using PseudoFuN. These databases are consistent with previous 1:1 PGG annotation and also are much more powerful including millions of de novo PGG associations. For example, we find multiple known (e.g., miR-20a-PTEN-PTENP1) and novel (e.g., miR-375-SOX15-PPP4R1L) microRNA-gene-pseudogene associations in prostate cancer. PseudoFuN provides a ""one stop shop"" for identifying and visualizing thousands of potential regulatory relationships related to pseudogenes in The Cancer Genome Atlas cancers.  Conclusions:   Thousands of new PGG associations can be explored in the context of microRNA-gene-pseudogene co-expression and differential expression with a simple-to-use online tool by bioinformaticians and oncologists alike.""","""['Travis S Johnson', 'Sihong Li', 'Eric Franz', 'Zhi Huang', 'Shuyu Dan Li', 'Moray J Campbell', 'Kun Huang', 'Yan Zhang']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Gigascience""","""['Network analysis of pseudogene-gene relationships: from pseudogene evolution to their functional potentials.', 'Pseudogene-gene functional networks are prognostic of patient survival in breast cancer.', 'GENCODE pseudogenes.', 'Pseudogene-expressed RNAs: a new frontier in cancers.', 'Computational Methods for Pseudogene Annotation Based on Sequence Homology.', 'ceRNAs in Cancer: Mechanism and Functions in a Comprehensive Regulatory Network.', 'Epigenetic Silencing of SOX15 Is Controlled by miRNAs rather than Methylation in Papillary Thyroid Cancer.', 'Identification of a 15-pseudogene based prognostic signature for predicting survival and antitumor immune response in breast cancer.', 'Pseudo2GO: A Graph-Based Deep Learning Method for Pseudogene Function Prediction by Borrowing Information From Coding Genes.', 'Acidic leucine-rich nuclear phosphoprotein-32A expression contributes to adverse outcome in acute myeloid leukemia.']"""

Methods:   We analyzed data from a network of case-control studies conducted in Italy between 1991 and 2014. The studies included cancers of the oral cavity (n = 509), pharynx (n = 436), nasopharynx (n = 198), larynx (n = 459), esophagus (n = 304), stomach (n = 230), colon (n = 1225), rectum (n = 728), liver (n = 184), pancreas (n = 326), breast (n = 2569), endometrium (n = 454), ovary (n = 1031), prostate (n = 1294), kidney (n = 767), and bladder (n = 690). Controls were 13 563 patients hospitalized for acute, non-neoplastic conditions. Dietary inflammatory index (DII) scores were computed based on 31 food parameters assessed using a reproducible and validated food frequency questionnaire. Odds ratios were estimated through logistic regression models adjusting for recognized confounding factors.  Results:   The DII increased with age, with lower scores among men than women, in individuals located in northern rather than in central or southern Italy, and in controls more than in cancer cases. After adjustment for cancer-specific potential confounders, an increasing DII score was directly associated with cancer risk for all considered cancer sites, except for liver and endometrium. Although the DII level varied across age groups, no heterogeneity in cancer risk emerged for any of the considered cancer sites.  Conclusions:   In the Italian population, DII scores were higher in elderly than in middle-aged individuals. Although not directly affecting cancer risk, this finding may have important implications for the older population because elevated DII scores, indicating a proinflammatory diet, also have been associated with frailty.""","""['Giulia Accardi', 'Nitin Shivappa', 'Matteo Di Maso', 'James R Hébert', 'Lucia Fratino', 'Maurizio Montella', 'Carlo La Vecchia', 'Calogero Caruso', 'Diego Serraino', 'Massimo Libra', 'Jerry Polesel']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Nutrition""","""['Dietary inflammatory index and ovarian cancer risk in a large Italian case-control study.', 'Dietary inflammatory index is positively associated with serum high-sensitivity C-reactive protein in a Korean adult population.', 'Dietary Inflammatory Index and Risk of Bladder Cancer in a Large Italian Case-control Study.', 'Meta-analysis of the association between dietary inflammatory index (DII) and cancer outcomes.', 'Index-Based Dietary Patterns and the Risk of Prostate Cancer.', 'Diets, Dietary Patterns, Single Foods and Pancreatic Cancer Risk: An Umbrella Review of Meta-Analyses.', 'Association of Dietary Inflammatory Index (DII) and Depressive Disorders.', 'A proinflammatory diet is associated with increased odds of frailty after 12-year follow-up in a cohort of adults.', 'Dietary inflammatory index and odds of breast cancer: A case-control study.', 'Change in dietary inflammatory index score is associated with control of long-term rheumatoid arthritis disease activity in a Japanese cohort: the TOMORROW study.']"""

In the case of the devastating childhood bone cancer osteosarcoma, PEDF has direct anticancer activity per se, and protects against the toxicity of doxorubicin in the heart, small intestine and testes. PEDF demonstrated anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effects against human prostate and breast cancer cells, tumors which are known to metastasize to bone as the preferred secondary site. Caspase-2 was activated in both tumor cell types by PEDF. In models of prostate and breast cancer in bone, PEDF significantly reduced tumor volumes.

Using immunohistochemistry, DCLK1 expression was examined in a well-defined tissue microarray series of 472 bladder cancer tissues.

Our findings showed strong, moderate, and weak DCLK1 expression in 123 (26.1%), 230 (48.7%), and 119 (25.2%) of the bladder cancer specimens, respectively. Higher expression of DCLK1 was significantly associated with increase in histological grade (P ≤ .001), pT stage (P = .014), lamina propria (P = .006), and lamina propria/muscularis (L/M) involvement (P = .014). On multivariate analysis, pT stage (P < .001), histological grade (P = .021), and lamina propria involvement (P = .001) were independent prognostic factors in DCLK1 expression. Moreover, the expression of DCLK1 was found to be an independent marker of poor prognosis for disease- specific survival (DSS) (P = .048) in bladder carcinomas.

Nutlin3a inhibits the degradation of the P53 protein, triggers P53-mediated apoptosis in cancer cells and enhances the effectiveness of chemotherapeutics. However, its low aqueous solubility is the major disadvantage when it comes to in vivo administration. In order to facilitate an aqueous formulation of Nutlin3a and to enhance its apoptotic activity on cancer cells, Nutlin3a was encapsulated in solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) prepared by Ouzo method. Physicochemical characterization was performed and activity of apoptosis induction on wild-type P53 expressing LNCaP prostate cancer cell line was evaluated. Nutlin3a-loaded cationic solid lipid nanoparticles were found to stabilize functional P53 at protein level. In addition, induction rate of apoptosis by nanoparticles was higher than Nutlin3a solution in DMSO, proving this nanoparticle formulation is a promising candidate for increasing the efficiency of Nutlin3a for P53(+) cancer cases.

Recent studies show that microRNAs (miRs) are involved in the anticancer activities of bufalin, while long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are known to interact with miRNAs to regulate various biological functions. In this paper, we investigated the possible network related to the antimetastatic effect of bufalin in prostate cancer (PCa) cells. We demonstrated that bufalin (0.05-10 µM) dose-dependently suppressed the proliferation of prostate cancer DU145 and PC3 cells with IC50 values of 0.89 and 1.28 µM, respectively. Furthermore, bufalin treatment significantly suppressed the cell migration and invasion. To explore the role of lncRNAs in the antimetastatic activity of bufalin, we used an lncRNA microarray and found that HOX transcript antisense RNA (HOTAIR) was the most markedly downregulated lncRNA in bufalin-treated PCa cells. Overexpression of HOTAIR counteracted the suppressing effects of bufalin on DU145 and PC3 cells. We then predicted and verified that HOTAIR upregulated FGFR1 expression by sponging miR-520b in PCa cells. In 40 patients with PCa bone metastasis, we used in situ hybridization or immunohistochemical assay to assess the HOTAIR and FGFR1 expression, which revealed that both HOTAIR and FGFR1 expression were significantly higher in bone metastasis tissues than in the primary PCa tissues. In addition, the level of serum HOTAIR was positively associated with the levels of serum bone metabolic markers (CTx, OST, B-ALP and PINP) and may serve as a reasonable biomarker for PCa bone metastasis. Taken together, this is the first study revealing that HOTAIR promotes PCa bone metastasis, and bufalin may be a promising candidate for the treatment of this disease.""","""['Jian-Jun Zhang#', 'Xiao-Hui Zhou#', 'Yan Zhou', 'Yong-Gang Wang', 'Bin-Zhi Qian', 'Ai-Na He', 'Zan Shen', 'Hai-Yan Hu', 'Yang Yao']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Acta Pharmacol Sin""","""['Genistein inhibits prostate cancer cell growth by targeting miR-34a and oncogenic HOTAIR.', 'Involvement of aberrantly activated HOTAIR/EZH2/miR-193a feedback loop in progression of prostate cancer.', 'Long non-‑coding RNA SNHG16 functions as a tumor activator by sponging miR‑373‑3p to regulate the TGF‑β‑R2/SMAD pathway in prostate cancer.', 'Bufalin for an innovative therapeutic approach against cancer.', 'HOTAIR beyond repression: In protein degradation, inflammation, DNA damage response, and cell signaling.', 'Bufalin targeting BFAR inhibits the occurrence and metastasis of gastric cancer through PI3K/AKT/mTOR signal pathway.', 'Bufalin suppresses esophageal squamous cell carcinoma progression by activating the PIAS3/STAT3 signaling pathway.', 'Long non-coding RNAs in bone metastasis: progresses and perspectives as potential diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers.', 'Toad venom-derived bufadienolides and their therapeutic application in prostate cancers: Current status and future directions.', 'Cancer-associated fibroblasts promote malignant phenotypes of prostate cancer cells via autophagy : Cancer-associated fibroblasts promote prostate cancer development.']"""

Materials and methods:   From January 2016 to December 2018, 256 men with a PI-RADS (Prostate Imaging-Reporting and Data System) score 3 (80 cases) or 4 (176 cases) and negative repeat transperineal saturation biopsy plus TPBx, underwent a new TPBx (four cores) for the persistent clinical suspicion of cancer. The accuracy of mpMRI ADC (apparent diffusion coefficient) values in the diagnosis of csPCa were evaluated.  Results:   Overall detection rate of csPCa was equal to 10.1% (26/256 cases): 2.5% (2/80) versus 13.6% (24/176) had a PI-RADS score equal to 3 versus 4, respectively.

Many PSMA analog radiotracers for PET/CT prostate cancer staging have been developed, such as 68Ga-PSMA-11. This radiotracer has achieved good results in multiple clinical trials, but because of the superior imaging characteristics of 18F-fluoride, 18F-PSMA-11 was developed. The aim of this study was to evaluate the administration safety and radiation dosimetry of 18F-PSMA-11. Methods: Six patients (aged 62-68 y; mean, 66 ± 2 y) with suspected prostate cancer recurrence after previous treatment were administered 2 MBq of 18F-PSMA-11 per kilogram of body weight and then underwent low-dose PET/CT imaging at 0, 20, 50, 90, and 300 min after injection. To evaluate the safety of administration, vital parameters were monitored. To assess toxicity, full blood count and biochemical parameters were determined. According to the latest International Commission on Radiological Protection recommendations, radiation dosimetry analysis was performed using IDAC-Dose 2.1. For blood activity measurement, small samples of venous blood were collected at various time points after injection. The unbound 18F-fluoride fraction was determined in plasma at 20, 50, and 90 min after administration to evaluate the defluorination rate of 18F-PSMA-11. Results: After injection, 18F-PSMA-11 cleared rapidly from the blood. At 5 h after injection, 29.0% ± 5.9% of the activity was excreted in urine. The free 18F fraction in plasma increased from 9.7% ± 1.0% 20 min after injection to 22.2% ± 1.5% 90 min after injection. The highest tracer uptake was observed in kidneys, bladder, spleen, and liver. No study drug-related adverse events were observed. The calculated mean effective dose was 12.8 ± 0.6 μSv/MBq. Conclusion:18F-PSMA-11 can be safely administered and results in a mean effective dose of 12.8 ± 0.6 μSv/MBq. Therefore, the total radiation dose is lower than for other PSMA PET agents and in the same range as 18F-DCFPyL.""","""['Sarah Piron', 'Kathia De Man', 'Nick Van Laeken', ""Yves D'Asseler"", 'Klaus Bacher', 'Ken Kersemans', 'Piet Ost', 'Karel Decaestecker', 'Pieter Deseyne', 'Valérie Fonteyne', 'Nicolaas Lumen', 'Eric Achten', 'Boudewijn Brans', 'Filip De Vos']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""J Nucl Med""","""['More advantages in detecting bone and soft tissue metastases from prostate cancer using 18F-PSMA PET/CT.', 'Quantitative and Qualitative Analyses of Biodistribution and PET Image Quality of a Novel Radiohybrid PSMA, 18F-rhPSMA-7, in Patients with Prostate Cancer.', '68GaGa-P16-093 as a PSMA-Targeted PET Radiopharmaceutical for Detection of Cancer: Initial Evaluation and Comparison with 68GaGa-PSMA-11 in Prostate Cancer Patients Presenting with Biochemical Recurrence.', '18FDCFPyL PET/CT for Imaging of Prostate Cancer.', 'The Effects on Technologist Occupational Exposure in PET/CT Departments When Working with Students at Various Levels of Supervision.', 'Next-generation PET/CT imaging in meningioma-first clinical experiences using the novel SSTR-targeting peptide 18FSiTATE.', 'Recurrent Prostate Cancer Diagnostics with 18F-PSMA-1007 PET/CT: A Systematic Review of the Current State.', 'Preclinical comparative study of 18FAlF-PSMA-11 and 18FPSMA-1007 in varying PSMA expressing tumors.', 'The future of PSMA PET and WB MRI as next-generation imaging tools in prostate cancer.', 'Radiolabeled PSMA Inhibitors.']"""

Patients with aggressive disease typically undergo hormone deprivation therapy. Although treatment is initially very successful, these men commonly progress to lethal, castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) in 2 to 3 years. Standard therapies for CRPC include second-generation antiandrogens, which prolong patient lifespan by only several months. It is imperative to advance our understanding of the mechanisms leading to resistance to identify new therapies for aggressive prostate cancer. This study identifies Notch1 as a therapeutic target in prostate cancer. Loss of NOTCH1 in aggressive prostate cancer cells decreases proliferation, invasion, and tumorsphere formation. Therapeutic inhibition of Notch1 activity with gamma secretase inhibitors RO4929097 or DAPT in prostate cancer cells further results in decreased proliferative abilities. Loss of NOTCH1 and treatment of immunocompromised mice bearing prostate cancer xenografts with RO4929097 display significantly impaired tumor growth. Loss of NOTCH1 additionally decreased metastatic potential of prostate cancer cells in invasion assays in vitro as well as in vivo experiments. Moreover, treatment with gamma secretase inhibitors or NOTCH1 gene deletion synergized with antiandrogen therapies, enzalutamide or abiraterone, to decrease the growth of prostate cancer cells. Combination of gamma secretase inhibitors with abiraterone significantly inhibited cell migration and invasion, while combination with enzalutamide reversed enzalutamide-induced migration and invasion. These collective findings suggest loss of NOTCH1 delays growth of CRPC and inhibits metastasis, and inhibition of Notch1 activation in conjunction with second-generation antiandrogen therapies could delay growth and progression of prostate cancer.""","""['Meghan A Rice', 'En-Chi Hsu', 'Merve Aslan', 'Ali Ghoochani', 'Austin Su', 'Tanya Stoyanova']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Mol Cancer Ther""","""['Antiandrogen abiraterone and docetaxel treatments affect Notch1, Jagged1 and Hes1 expressions in metastatic prostate cancer cells.', 'Activation of Notch1 synergizes with multiple pathways in promoting castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Systematic Evaluation for the Influences of the SOX17/Notch Receptor Family Members on Reversing Enzalutamide Resistance in Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer Cells.', 'Second-Generation Antiandrogens: From Discovery to Standard of Care in Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Exploitation of the Androgen Receptor to Overcome Taxane Resistance in Advanced Prostate Cancer.', 'Strategies to Re-Sensitize Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer to Antiandrogen Therapy.', 'Anti-Cancer Stem-Cell-Targeted Therapies in Prostate Cancer.', 'Identification of NLE1/CDK1 axis as key regulator in the development and progression of non-small cell lung cancer.', 'Interplay of Developmental Hippo-Notch Signaling Pathways with the DNA Damage Response in Prostate Cancer.', 'From Therapy Resistance to Targeted Therapies in Prostate Cancer.']"""

Two tissue-limited models showed that prostate vitamin D receptor (VDR) loss increased prostate carcinogenesis. In another study, we fed diets with three vitamin D3 levels (inadequate = 25 IU/kg diet, adequate for bone health = 150 IU/kg, or high = 1,000 IU/kg) and two calcium levels (adequate for bone health = 0.5% and high = 1.5%). Dietary vitamin D caused a dose-dependent increase in serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels and a reduction in the percentage of mice with adenocarcinoma but did not improve bone mass. In contrast, high calcium suppressed serum 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D levels and improved bone mass but increased the incidence of adenocarcinoma. Analysis of the VDR cistrome in RWPE1 prostate epithelial cells revealed vitamin D-mediated regulation of multiple cancer-relevant pathways. Our data support the hypothesis that the loss of vitamin D signaling accelerates the early stages of prostate carcinogenesis, and our results suggest that different dietary requirements may be needed to support prostate health or maximize bone mass. SIGNIFICANCE: This work shows that disrupting vitamin D signaling through diet or genetic deletion increases early prostate carcinogenesis through multiple pathways.

Introduction of deep-learning approach would improve prostate segmentation.  Objective:   To exploit deep learning to perform automatic, real-time prostate (zone) segmentation on TRUS images from different scanners.  Design, setting, and participants:   Three datasets with TRUS images were collected at different institutions, using an iU22 (Philips Healthcare, Bothell, WA, USA), a Pro Focus 2202a (BK Medical), and an Aixplorer (SuperSonic Imagine, Aix-en-Provence, France) ultrasound scanner. The datasets contained 436 images from 181 men.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Manual delineations from an expert panel were used as ground truth. The (zonal) segmentation performance was evaluated in terms of the pixel-wise accuracy, Jaccard index, and Hausdorff distance.  Results and limitations:   The developed deep-learning approach was demonstrated to significantly improve prostate segmentation compared with a conventional automated technique, reaching median accuracy of 98% (95% confidence interval 95-99%), a Jaccard index of 0.93 (0.80-0.96), and a Hausdorff distance of 3.0 (1.3-8.7) mm. Zonal segmentation yielded pixel-wise accuracy of 97% (95-99%) and 98% (96-99%) for the peripheral and transition zones, respectively. Supervised domain adaptation resulted in retainment of high performance when applied to images from different ultrasound scanners (p > 0.05). Moreover, the algorithm's assessment of its own segmentation performance showed a strong correlation with the actual segmentation performance (Pearson's correlation 0.72, p < 0.001), indicating that possible incorrect segmentations can be identified swiftly.  Conclusions:   Fusion-guided prostate biopsies, targeting suspicious lesions on MRI using TRUS are increasingly performed. The requirement for (semi)manual prostate delineation places a substantial burden on clinicians. Deep learning provides a means for fast and accurate (zonal) prostate segmentation of TRUS images that translates to different scanners.  Patient summary:   Artificial intelligence for automatic delineation of the prostate on ultrasound was shown to be reliable and applicable to different scanners. This method can, for example, be applied to speed up, and possibly improve, guided prostate biopsies using magnetic resonance imaging-transrectal ultrasound fusion.""","""['Ruud J G van Sloun', 'Rogier R Wildeboer', 'Christophe K Mannaerts', 'Arnoud W Postema', 'Maudy Gayet', 'Harrie P Beerlage', 'Georg Salomon', 'Hessel Wijkstra', 'Massimo Mischi']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Eur Urol Focus""","""['Automatic prostate segmentation using deep learning on clinically diverse 3D transrectal ultrasound images.', 'Label-driven magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) registration using weakly supervised learning for MRI-guided prostate radiotherapy.', 'Standardized Magnetic Resonance Imaging Reporting Using the Prostate Cancer Radiological Estimation of Change in Sequential Evaluation Criteria and Magnetic Resonance Imaging/Transrectal Ultrasound Fusion with Transperineal Saturation Biopsy to Select Men on Active Surveillance.', 'Magnetic resonance imaging-targeted biopsy may enhance the diagnostic accuracy of significant prostate cancer detection compared to standard transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsy: a systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging/Ultrasound Fusion-guided Transperineal Versus Magnetic Resonance Imaging/Ultrasound Fusion-guided Transrectal Prostate Biopsy-A Systematic Review.', 'Research progress on deep learning in magnetic resonance imaging-based diagnosis and treatment of prostate cancer: a review on the current status and perspectives.', 'Artificial Intelligence for Clinical Diagnosis and Treatment of Prostate Cancer.', 'A review of artificial intelligence in prostate cancer detection on imaging.', 'Domain generalization for prostate segmentation in transrectal ultrasound images: A multi-center study.', 'Role of Deep Learning in Prostate Cancer Management: Past, Present and Future Based on a Comprehensive Literature Review.']"""

Therefore, the effects of juniper on p53 and Akt signaling was examined further in A549 lung, 22RV1 and DU145 prostate, and HepG2 liver cancer cells using Western blot, confocal microscopy, and MTT analysis. We found that juniper simultaneously decreased cell viability, activated the p53 pathway, and inactivated the PI3K/Akt pathway. The p53 activation was associated with increased nuclear p53 level. Akt was dephosphorylated, and its inactivation was associated with increased levels of PHLPP1 and PHLPP2 phosphatases. Parallel increases of PARP suggest that JE decreased cell viability by activating cell death. In adtion, JE potentiated the effects of gemcitabine and 5-fluorouracil anticancer drugs.
