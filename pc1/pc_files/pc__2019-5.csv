Methods:   We performed a single-center analysis of 180 men with PCa, undergoing clinical staging by digital rectal examination (DRE) as well as MRI before their robot-assisted radical prostatectomy. Patients were stratified according to the EAU guidelines into 4 well-defined risk categories, based on their clinical T-stage assessed by either DRE or MRI. Descriptive statistics of categorical variables are shown as frequencies and proportions. Differences between both scenarios (DRE- vs MRI-staged) were analyzed using a paired-samples sign test.  Results:   Use of MRI information instead of DRE information leads to significant upstaging of clinical T-stage (33%) and EAU risk grouping (31%). When comparing these results with the pathologic T-stage, MRI showed a higher sensitivity than DRE to detect nonorgan-confined PCa (59% vs 41%; P <.01). In contrast, the specificity of MRI was lower than DRE (69% vs 95%; P <.01). Incorporation of MRI-based instead of DRE-based staging in the treatment decision process would alter the surgical treatment strategy in 49/180 patients (27%).  Conclusion:   The incorporation of MRI information substantially affects the treatment choice in PCa patients as compared to using the current available EAU guidelines based on DRE information. More specifically, treatment intensification would be recommended in 1 out of 4 patients.""","""['Cédric Draulans', 'Wouter Everaerts', 'Sofie Isebaert', 'Thomas Gevaert', 'Raymond Oyen', 'Steven Joniau', 'Evelyne Lerut', 'Liesbeth De Wever', 'Birgit Weynand', 'Els Vanhoutte', 'Gert De Meerleer', 'Karin Haustermans']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Urology""","""['Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging Should Be Preferred Over Digital Rectal Examination for Prostate Cancer Local Staging and Disease Risk Classification.', 'The impact of local staging of prostate cancer determined on MRI or DRE at time of radical prostatectomy on progression-free survival: A Will Rogers phenomenon.', 'Multiparametric MRI in detection and staging of prostate cancer.', 'More advantages in detecting bone and soft tissue metastases from prostate cancer using 18F-PSMA PET/CT.', 'EAU guidelines on prostate cancer.', ""The association of the type and number of D'Amico high-risk criteria with rates of pathologically non-organ-confined prostate cancer."", 'How To Manage T3b Prostate Cancer in the Contemporary Era: Referee Position.', 'How To Manage T3b Prostate Cancer in the Contemporary Era: The Benefits of Surgery.', 'Impact of prebiopsy MRI on prostate cancer staging: Results from the Norwegian Prostate Cancer Registry.', 'Assessing the impact of MRI based diagnostics on pre-treatment disease classification and prognostic model performance in men diagnosed with new prostate cancer from an unscreened population.']"""

Additionally, Prostate tumor-overexpressed gene 1 protein (PTOV1) was included due to its potential relevance in laryngeal cancer. Moreover, as cancer resistance might involve autophagy in some circumstances, we studied the intrinsic drug resistance capacity of primary tumor cultures derived from 13 laryngeal cancer biopsies and their expression levels of LC3, ATG5, p62 and PTOV1. Overall, our results suggest that (i) cytoplasmic p62 and PTOV1 can be considered prognostic markers in laryngeal cancer, (ii) the acquisition of resistance seems to be related to PTOV1 and autophagy-related protein overexpression, (iii) by increasing autophagy, PTOV1 might contribute to resistance in this model and (iv) the expression of autophagy-related proteins could classify a subgroup of laryngeal cancer patients who will benefit from a therapy based upon autophagy inhibition.

Although oncologic control is highest with salvage prostatectomy, the procedure is associated with substantial morbidity.  Objective:   To identify factors associated with successful salvage cryoablation for radiorecurrent prostate cancer.  Design:   We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of patients who underwent salvage cryoablation at our institution between 2005 and 2015. All patients had biopsy-proven local recurrence after radiotherapy. Patients with seminal vesicle invasion or metastases were excluded. Complete follow-up was obtained for all patients.  Main outcome measures:   Primary study endpoint was biochemical progression-free survival based on the Phoenix criteria.  Results:   Seventy-five patients underwent salvage cryotherapy. Mean patient age was 69.3 years. The overall biochemical salvage rate was 50.7% at a median follow-up of 3.9 years. The following factors were independently associated with successful cryotherapy: Precryotherapy Gleason score of 3 + 3 or 3 + 4, low precryotherapy prostate-specific antigen (PSA), low precryotherapy PSA density, longer time to PSA nadir after radiotherapy, and low postcryotherapy PSA nadir. A postcryotherapy PSA nadir of 0.5 ng/mL or less was associated with a biochemical progression-free survival of 79.7% at 3 years and 64.7% at 5 years, whereas a postcryotherapy PSA nadir above 0.5 was associated with a biochemical progression-free survival of 5.6% at 3 years and 0% at 5 years (p < 0.0001).  Conclusion:   Approximately 50% of the patients achieved biochemical salvage with cryoablation at 5 years.

Methods:   The authors compared stage of disease at the time of presentation and mortality after diagnosis between 14,453 PLWH and 6,368,126 HIV-uninfected patients diagnosed with cancers of the oral cavity, stomach, colorectum, anus, liver, pancreas, lung, female breast, cervix, prostate, bladder, kidney, and thyroid and melanoma using data from the National Cancer Data Base (2004-2014). Polytomous logistic regression and Cox proportional hazards regression were used to evaluate the association between HIV, cancer stage, and stage-adjusted mortality after diagnosis, respectively. Regression models accounted for the type of health facility at which cancer treatment was administered and the type of individual health insurance.  Results:   HIV-infected patients with cancer were found to be more likely to be uninsured (HIV-infected: 5.0% vs HIV-uninfected: 3.3%; P < .0001) and were less likely to have private health insurance (25.4% vs 44.7%; P < .0001). Compared with those not infected with HIV, the odds of being diagnosed at an advanced stage of disease were significantly elevated in PLWH for melanoma and cancers of the oral cavity, liver, female breast, prostate, and thyroid (odds ratio for stage IV vs stage I range, 1.24-2.06). PLWH who were diagnosed with stage I to stage III disease experienced elevated mortality after diagnosis across 13 of the 14 cancer sites evaluated, with hazard ratios ranging from 1.20 (95% CI, 1.14-1.26) for lung cancer to 1.85 (95% CI, 1.68-2.04), 1.85 (95% CI, 1.51-2.27), and 2.93 (95% CI, 2.08-4.13), respectively, for cancers of the female breast, cervix, and thyroid.

It is detected in prostatic tissue of benign prostatic hyperplasia, prostatitis, and prostate cancer (PCa) and has been suggested to cause chronic prostatitis. Moreover, up to 20% of all cancers worldwide are associated with chronic inflammation. Here, we investigated whether inflammatory mediators produced by normal human prostate epithelial cells (RWPE-1) stimulated with Tv could promote growth and invasiveness of PCa cells.  Methods:   Conditioned medium of RWPE-1 cells was prepared by stimulating them with Tv (trichomonad-conditioned medium [TCM]) and without Tv (conditioned medium [CM]). Promotion of PCa cells (PC3, DU145, and LNCaP) was assessed by wound healing, proliferation, and invasion assays.  Results:   We observed that the production of interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, CCL2, CXCL8, prostaglandin-E2 (PGE2 ), and COX2 by RWPE-1 cells was increased by stimulating them with Tv. When PCa cells were incubated with TCM, their proliferation, invasion, and migration increased. Moreover, they showed increased epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-related markers by a reduction in epithelial markers and an increase in mesenchymal markers. In vivo, xenograft tumor tissues injected with TCM also showed increased expression of cyclin D1 and proliferating cell nuclear antigen, as well as induction of EMT. Receptors and signal molecules of PCa cells increased in response to exposure to TCM, and blocking receptors (CXCR1, CXCR2, C-C chemokine receptor 2, glycoprotein 130, EP2, and EP4) reduced the proliferation of PCa cells with decreased production of cytokines (CCL2, IL-6, and CXCL8) and PGE2 , and expression of NF-κB and Snail1.  Conclusions:   Our results suggest that Tv infection may be one of the factors creating the supportive microenvironment to promote proliferation and invasiveness of PCa cells.""","""['Ik-Hwan Han', 'Jung-Hyun Kim', 'Ki-Seok Jang', 'Jae-Sook Ryu']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Inflammatory response to Trichomonas vaginalis in the pathogenesis of prostatitis and benign prostatic hyperplasia.', 'IL-6 produced by prostate epithelial cells stimulated with Trichomonas vaginalis\xa0promotes proliferation of prostate cancer cells by inducing M2 polarization of THP-1-derived macrophages.', 'Inflammatory Responses in a Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia Epithelial Cell Line (BPH-1) Infected with Trichomonas vaginalis.', 'Signalling pathways associated with IL-6 production and epithelial-mesenchymal transition induction in prostate epithelial cells stimulated with Trichomonas vaginalis.', 'The inflammatory microenvironment and microbiome in prostate cancer development.', 'HSPB1 facilitates chemoresistance through inhibiting ferroptotic cancer cell death and regulating NF-κB signaling pathway in breast cancer.', 'Inflammatory response to Trichomonas vaginalis in the pathogenesis of prostatitis and benign prostatic hyperplasia.', 'Infinity war: Trichomonas vaginalis and interactions with host immune response.', 'The correlation between Trichomonas vaginalis infection and reproductive system cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Point-of-Care Diagnostic for Trichomonas vaginalis, the Most Prevalent, Non-Viral Sexually Transmitted Infection.']"""

The reason for this may be rooted in biological differences in the cancer between the two groups; however, there may be some inherent disparities within the efficacy of the screening modalities. In this study, we aim to evaluate the negative predictive value (NPV) of multi-parametric MRI (mpMRI) between AA compared to CAUs.  Methods:   All mpMRI between January 2014 and June 2017 were evaluated. The MRIs were read by dedicated genitourinary radiologists. Subsequently, the readings were correlated to final pathology after the patients underwent radical prostatectomy. The NPV and negative likelihood ratios (-LR) of mpMRI were evaluated in AAs versus CAUs based on four cutoffs (≥ Grade I, ≥ Grade II, ≥ Grade III and ≥ Grade IV).  Results:   The mpMRI was almost equally as effective between AAs and CAUs in excluding Grade III (NPV = 89 and 94, respectively), and Grade IV or above (NPV = 96 and 98, respectively) PCa; however, the NPV of mpMRI was significantly lower for Grade I (NPV = 32 and 52, respectively) and Grade II (NPV = 50 and 79, respectively) PCa.

Methods:   We retrospectively evaluated the medical records of 122 male cancer patients who were referred to our urology department between 2014 and 2016 for voiding problems. They underwent colorectal surgery within 3 months; we estimated the correlations of the TPV measurements made using CT, MRI, and TRUS. A total of 122 TRUS, 88 MRI, and 34 CT images were reviewed repeatedly, twice by 2 independent urologists within 1 month after the initial evaluation. The correlations were statistically evaluated using a Bland-Altman plot and Spearman and Pearson correlation analyses.  Results:   Overall median age was 70.5 years and the median TPV, as measured using TRUS, CT, and MRI, was 33.2, 43.4, and 30.1 mL, respectively. There was a good correlation in TPV measured with CT (coefficient >0.7) and MRI (>0.8). There was not a good correlation between TRUS and preoperative and postoperative CT/MRI; preoperative CT/MRI had a higher correlation (>0.7) than postoperative CT/MRI (>0.8). When stratified by prostate volume, preoperative CT (>0.58-0.59) correlated better for <30 mL and preoperative MRI (0.70-0.75) correlated better for ≥30 mL.

In our previous study, we have obtained a PSMA-specific single-chain variable fragment (scFv), named gy1, from a large yeast display naïve human scFv library. In this study, we reconstructed the PSMA scFv into a fully human antibody (named PSMAb) and evaluated its characterization both in vitro and in vivo We showed that PSMAb can specifically bind with and internalize into PSMA+ cells. The binding affinity of PSMAb is measured to be at nanomolar level, and PSMAb has very good thermostability. In vivo study showed that near IR dye-labeled PSMAb can specifically localize at PSMA+ tumors, and the application of PSMAb in vivo significantly inhibited the growth of PSMA+ tumors, but not PSMA- tumors. At the studied doses, no obvious toxicity was observed when applied in vivo, as shown by the relative normal liver and kidney function and normal structure of important organs, shown by hematoxylin and eosin staining. In addition, PSMAb may inhibit tumor growth through antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity and complement-dependent cytotoxicity mechanisms.

Alpha-2-macroglobulin (α2M) is the primary proteinase inhibitor and is abundant in vertebrate plasma. Previous studies have shown that α2M levels were down regulated in prostate cancer. Our results of functional assay shows 50% decrease in the antiproteolytic potential ofα2Mupon its interaction with dutasteride. Fluorescence quenching revealed that dutasteride binds with α2M via static mechanism, resulting in the formation of dutasteride-α2M complex. Synchronous fluorescence studies suggest alteration in the microenvironment around tryptophan residues. Changes in the UV-visible spectra hints at formation of complex between the drug and protein. Secondary structural perturbations in α2M are confirmed by circular dichroism studies. Molecular docking discloses the involvement of hydrogen bonding during the interaction process and suggests the site of interaction of dutasteride on α2M monomer as Asn173, Lys171, Asp1178, Lys1236, His1182, Lys1177, Ser1180 and Lys1240.Isothermal titration calorimetry affirms the binding process to be spontaneous and exothermic.

Yet, the national trends of MRI at the time of prostate biopsy and its ability to increase the detection of PCa in a biopsy-naïve population remain unknown.  Objective:   To elucidate the contemporary trends of MRI and prostate biopsy, and whether it improved PCa diagnosis among privately insured patients.  Design, setting, and participants:   This was a retrospective cohort study of a large private health insurance database in the USA-the OptumLabs Data Warehouse. We identified all men ≥40 yr of age who underwent index prostate biopsies from 2010 through 2016.  Intervention:   MRI-prostate at the time of index biopsy.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Utilization of the MRI at the time of biopsy and incident PCa diagnosis constituted the primary outcomes. We enumerated unadjusted and age-specific annual rates of MRI over time to elucidate trends using regression models (trend analysis). Bivariate and multivariable regression analyses identified patient characteristics associated with MRI-prostate, and the association between the use of MRI and PCa diagnosis.  Results and limitations:   Overall, 119 202 men underwent index prostate biopsies. Unadjusted annual rates of MRI at the time of biopsy significantly increased from 7 per 1000 biopsies in 2010 to 83 per 1000 biopsies in 2016 (p < 0.001 for trend). Age-specific rates increased across all age groups (40-49, 50-59, 60-65, 66-74, and 75+ yr; all p < 0.001). On multivariable analysis, black patients had a lower likelihood of MRI compared with white patients (odds ratio [OR]: 0.6; p < 0.01). MRI at the time of biopsy was not associated with a higher likelihood of incident PCa compared with traditional systematic biopsy (OR: 1.0; p = 0.7). The retrospective design and the inability to detect clinically significant PCa (Gleason 7+) constitute the limitations of this study.  Conclusions:   While the use of MRI at the time of biopsy rose markedly, it was not associated with a higher detection rate of PCa. Further research is needed to address effective dissemination of MRI and targeted biopsies, and racial disparities.

Methods:   We designed the nickel-based isolation (NBI) to rapidly isolate EVs and combined it with newly-designed amplified luminescent proximity homogeneous assay or digital PCR to detect biomarkers of clinical utility.  Findings:   From plasma of 46 healthy donors, we systematically recovered small EV (~250 nm of mean diameter; ~3 × 1010/ml) and large EV (~560 nm of mean diameter; ~5 × 108/ml) lineages ranging from 50 to 700 nm, which displayed hematopoietic/endothelial cell markers that were also used in spike-in experiments using EVs from tumor cell lines. In retrospective studies, we detected picomolar concentrations of prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) in fractions of EVs isolated from the plasma of prostate cancer patients, discriminating them from control subjects. Directly from oil-encapsulated EVs for digital PCR, we identified somatic BRAF and KRAS mutations circulating in the plasma of metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC) patients, matching 100% of concordance with tissue diagnostics. Importantly, with higher sensitivity and specificity compared with immuno-isolated EVs, we revealed additional somatic alterations in 7% of wild-type CRC cases that were subsequently validated by further inspections in the matched tissue biopsies.  Interpretation:   We propose NBI-combined approaches as simple, fast, and robust strategies to probe the tumor heterogeneity and contribute to the development of EV-based liquid biopsy studies.

Patients with other malignancies were identified using medical records and self-administrated questionnaires. Cox regression and Kaplan Meier analysis of a propensity score-matched patient cohort were performed to examine biochemical recurrence-free survival, metastasis-free survival, overall survival and prostate cancer-specific survival. Competing risk analysis was used to estimate other-cause mortality, other cancer-specific mortality, and prostate cancer-specific mortality. Statistical analysis was performed using R.  Results:   Of all patients, 6.4% were diagnosed with other malignancy prior to radical prostatectomy. Patients with tumor history were older (median: 66 years vs. 64 years., P< 0,001) and showed a higher tumor volume (median: 4.0 ml vs. 3.6 ml, P = 0.02) than patients without. The risk of biochemical recurrence and metastasis development after radical prostatectomy was similar.

We sought to determine the number and location of cores needed to adequately detect clinically significant prostate cancer (PCa). We identified patients undergoing MRI-US fusion prostate biopsy at our institution for known history or clinical suspicion of PCa. Multiparametric MRI studies were reviewed using Likert and Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) v2 schema. Multiple targeted cores were taken from each ROI followed by 12-core systematic biopsy. In a distinct cohort of patients, lesions were targeted using a predetermined five-core template. We estimated cancers detected through sampling of five or fewer cores, assessed by core number and core location. We identified 744 patients with 581 lesions with PCa. Seventy-seven percent (279/361) of Gleason (G) ≥3+4 tumors and 72% (137/189) of G >3+4 tumors were detected on two-core sampling. Relative to all targeted cores, a two-core approach missed 16% of clinically significant cancers at first biopsy, 27% in prior negative, and 32% in active surveillance patients. Detection of G ≥3+4 cancers did not differ by core location. Sampling of two cores of ROIs misses nearly one-quarter of clinically significant PCa detected on additional sampling. PATIENT SUMMARY: We aimed to understand how the number of cores obtained from a suspicious area during prostate magnetic resonance imaging-ultrasound fusion biopsy affects cancer detection.

The objective was to evaluate the prevalence and predictors of an AS approach in black men (BM) diagnosed with LRPC after inclusion of AS in LRPC consensus guidelines.  Materials and methods:   BM and white men (WM) diagnosed with LRPC (prostate-specific antigen ≤10 ng/mL, Gleason score [GS] ≤6, clinical stage T1-T2a) between 2010 and 2013 were identified from the National Cancer Database. Logistic regression models were used to assess the likelihood of AS over time and to examine associations between sociodemographic characteristics (SDCs) and the receipt of AS. A subanalysis was performed to assess the likelihood of GS upgrading on prostatectomy specimens for cases that received definitive treatment with radical prostatectomy.  Results:   Overall, 9% of BM (N=15,242) with LRPC were managed with AS. The likelihood of BM undergoing AS increased from 2010 and for all subsequent years of the study period (P<0.001). Uninsured BM were twice as likely as those with private insurance to undergo AS (odds ratio [OR]=1.97; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.51-2.58; P<0.001). BM were less likely than WM (N=86,655) to receive AS (OR=0.82; 95% CI, 0.77-0.87; P<0.001). However, on multivariate analysis adjusted for SDCs, there was no significant difference in AS utilization between the 2 race groups. Nearly half of BM (47.5%) treated with radical prostatectomy had a postprostatectomy GS≥7, and BM were 17% more likely to experience postprostatectomy upgrading to GS≥7 when compared with WM (OR=1.17; 95% CI, 1.08-1.26; P<0.001).  Conclusions:   The utilization of AS for BM with LRPC seems to be increasing, is influenced by SDCs, and may not differ from AS utilization among WM. Careful consideration of prostate biopsy technique and sampling as well as SDCs at time of treatment planning may be necessary to ensure adequate evaluation of prostatic disease and appropriate disease management for BM with LRPC.""","""['Nicolette Taku', 'Vivek Narayan', 'Xingmei Wang', 'Neha Vapiwala']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Am J Clin Oncol""","""['African American Race is Not Associated with Risk of Reclassification during Active Surveillance: Results from the Canary Prostate Cancer Active Surveillance Study.', 'Risk of Pathological Upgrading and Up Staging among Men with Low Risk Prostate Cancer Varies by Race: Results from the National Cancer Database.', 'African-American men with low-risk prostate cancer treated with radical prostatectomy in an equal-access health care system: implications for active surveillance.', 'Is active surveillance a suitable option for African American men with prostate cancer?

Doubling time of GIST is about 3.9 months for high-risk GIST, and the treatment paradigm for GIST has required the integration of surgery and molecular therapy.  Patient concerns:   A 70-year-old man with postoperative history of prostate cancer experienced fast-growing malignant jejunal GIST with multiple peritoneal metastases within 1 year.  Diagnoses:   Enhanced computed tomography (CT) detected a neoplasm of small intestine with multiple peritoneal nodules and postoperative pathology confirmed GIST.  Interventions:   Oral imatinib after surgery, at 400 mg per day, was used for 4 years.  Outcomes:   The patient remains well, and the peritoneal nodules located in front of the rectum disappeared gradually.  Lessons:   Physicians should be aware of possibility of GIST in patients with prostate cancer and can perform abdominal examination in these patients. For postoperative patients with prostate cancer, an yearly or half-yearly abdominal and pelvic cavity examination can be performed.

Although extensive research exists regarding barriers to enrollment in oncology clinical trials, there are limited studies evaluating processes to optimize patient education, oral anticancer therapy administration, and adherence for patients enrolled in clinical trials. In this study, we assess the feasibility of a video-based, personalized webpage for patients enrolled in genitourinary oncology clinical trials involving 1 or more oral anticancer therapy.  Objective:   The primary objective of this trial was to assess the differences in the number of patient-initiated violations in the intervention arm compared with a control arm over 4 treatment cycles. Secondary objectives included patient satisfaction, frequently asked questions by patients on the intervention arm, patient-initiated calls to study team members, and patient-reported stress levels.  Methods:   Eligible patients enrolling on a therapeutic clinical trial for a genitourinary malignancy were randomized 2:1 to the intervention arm or control arm. Patients randomized to the intervention arm received access to a video-based, personalized webpage, which included videos of patients' own clinic encounters with their providers, instructional videos on medication administration and side effects, and electronic versions of educational documents.  Results:   A total of 99 patients were enrolled (89 were evaluable; 66 completed 4 cycles). In total, 71% (40/56) of patients in the intervention arm had 1 or more patient-initiated violation compared with 70% (23/33) in the control arm. There was no difference in the total number of violations across 4 cycles between the 2 arms (estimate=-0.0939, 95% CI-0.6295 to 0.4418, P value=.73). Median baseline satisfaction scores for the intervention and control arms were 72 and 73, respectively, indicating high levels of patient satisfaction in both arms. Median baseline patient-reported stress levels were 10 and 13 for the intervention and control arms, respectively, indicating low stress levels in both arms at baseline.  Conclusions:   This study is among the first to evaluate a video-based, personalized webpage that provides patients with educational videos and video recordings of clinical trial appointments. Despite not meeting the primary endpoint of reduced patient-initiated violations, this study demonstrates the feasibility of a video-based, personalized webpage in clinical trials. Future research assessing this tool might be better suited for realms outside of clinical trials and might consider the use of an endpoint that assesses patient-reported outcomes directly.

The ELAC2 gene codes for the mitochondrial RNase Z, responsible for endonucleolytic cleavage of the 3' ends of mitochondrial pre-tRNAs. Here, we report the identification of 16 novel ELAC2 variants in individuals presenting with mitochondrial respiratory chain deficiency, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), and lactic acidosis. We provide evidence for the pathogenicity of the novel missense variants by studying the RNase Z activity in an in vitro system. We also modeled the residues affected by a missense mutation in solved RNase Z structures, providing insight into enzyme structure and function. Finally, we show that primary fibroblasts from the affected individuals have elevated levels of unprocessed mitochondrial RNA precursors.

We hypothesized that PCa cell-bone interactions would promote paracrine signaling. A panel of PCa cell lines were cocultured with hydroxyapatite ([HA]; inorganic component of bone) of different densities. Conditioned media (CM) was collected and analyzed for calcium levels and effect on paracrine signaling, cell migration, and viability in vitro and in vivo. Our results showed that calcium levels were elevated in CM from cancer cell-bone cocultures, compared to media or cancer cells alone, and this could be antagonized by ethylene glycol-bis(2-aminoethyl ether)N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid (EGTA), a calcium chelator, or knockdown of Snail protein. We also observed increased signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) phosphorylation and paracrine cell proliferation and migration in LNCaP cells incubated with CM from various cell lines; this phosphorylation and cell migration could be antagonized by Snail knockdown or various inhibitors including EGTA, STAT3 inhibitor (WP1066) or cathepsin L inhibitor (Z-FY-CHO). In vivo, higher HA bone density increased tumorigenicity and migration of tumor cells to HA implant.

The confounding effects of inflammation on the utility of PSA kinetics to predict prostate cancer may be partially mitigated by anti-inflammatory drug use. We investigated the influence of anti-inflammatory drug use on the association of PSA kinetics with prostate cancer risk.  Methods:   We studied 488 prostate cancer case-control pairs (290 white, 198 African American (AA)) nested in a retrospective cohort of men with a benign prostate biopsy. A series of multivariable models estimated prostate cancer risk associated with PSA velocity (PSAV) at different levels of anti-inflammatory drug use while adjusting for the presence of both clinical and histologic prostatitis.  Results:   In men with one, two, or three or more courses of anti-inflammatory drug use, for each ng/mL/year increase in PSAV, prostate cancer risk increased 1.21-fold, 1.83-fold, and 1.97-fold, respectively ( P < 0.0001). In controls with histologic prostatitis, anti-inflammatory drug use was associated with a significantly lower PSAV ( P < 0.0001). This association was not observed in men with histologic prostatitis who were subsequently diagnosed with prostate cancer. A positive interaction between anti-inflammatory drug use and PSAV-associated prostate cancer risk was only observed in AA men, as well as a strong positive association between any anti-inflammatory drug use and clinical prostatitis ( P = 0.004).

Therefore, there is a need for more specific and sensitive biomarkers to improve diagnostic accuracy and to predict prostate cancer (PCa) progression. Assessing the expression levels of specific microRNAs (miRNAs) in patients with PCa may be helpful in detecting cancer and predicting the cancer prognosis and its evolution, and may serve as markers to decide the treatment. We examined the expression levels of five miRNAs (let-7c, miR-21, miR-145, miR-185, and miR-221) on patients with low-risk PCa who had been eligible for active surveillance but underwent radical prostatectomy. We investigated the correlation between the relative expression of miRNAs and clinicopathologic parameters to evaluate their clinical significance.  Materials and methods:   Total RNA was isolated from the tumor and the corresponding non-neoplastic prostate tissue of 45 patients who underwent radical prostatectomy. Quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction was used to measure the levels of let-7c, miR-21, miR-145, miR-185, miR-221, and RNU6B expression, using TaqMan MicroRNA Assays. miRNA expression was examined in low-risk PCa, and miRNAs' association with Gleason upgraded (GU) and biochemical recurrent (BR) patients was evaluated.  Results:   We observed that miR-21 and miR-182 were overexpressed; conversely, let-7c, miR-145, and miR-221 were underexpressed in patients with low-risk PCa. GU patients (n = 16) and non-upgraded patients (n = 28) were compared. miR-145 was downregulated significantly in the GU group (P = 0.03). Similarly, miR-221 was downregulated significantly in patients with BR (n = 14) compared with non-recurrent patients (n = 30) (P = 0.04). Receiver operator characteristics (ROC) curve analysis revealed that miR-221 levels were significantly associated with BR in patients with a cut-off <-1.666, a value at which sensitivity was 70% and specificity 71% (area under curve [AUC] = 0.705, P = 0.030).

Little is known on biopsy undersampling of cribriform architecture. Our aim was to determine the extent of cribriform architecture undersampling and to find predictive factors for identifying false cribriform-negative cases.  Methods and results:   We reviewed 186 matched prostate biopsies and radical prostatectomy specimens. Of 97 biopsy grade group 2 (Gleason score 3 + 4 = 7) patients, 22 (23%) had true cribriform-negative (TN), 39 (40%) false-negative (FN) and 36 (37%) true-positive (TP) biopsies. Patients with FN biopsies had higher, although not statistically significant (P = 0.06), median PSA levels than patients with TP biopsies (12 versus 8 ng/ml). A PI-RADS 5 lesion was present in nine of 16 (54%) FN and three of 11 (27%) TN biopsies (P = 0.05). Positive biopsy rate (P = 0.47), percentage Gleason pattern 4 (P = 0.55) and glomeruloid architecture (P = 1.0) were not different. Logistic regression identified PSA as an independent predictor (odds ratio = 3.5; 95% confidence interval = 1.2-9.4, P = 0.02) for cribriform architecture on radical prostatectomy, but not PI-RADS score. The FN rate for large cribriform architecture at radical prostatectomy was 27%, which was lower than for any cribriform architecture (P = 0.01). During follow-up (median 27 months), biochemical recurrence-free survival of patients with TP biopsies was significantly shorter than that of those with FN biopsies (P = 0.03).  Conclusion:   In conclusion, 40% of grade group 2 prostate cancer biopsies were FN for cribriform architecture.

Here, we tissue-engineered and validated an in vitro microtissue model of osteoblastic bone metastases, and used it to study the effects of androgen deprivation in this microenvironment. The model was established by culturing primary human osteoprogenitor cells on melt electrowritten polymer scaffolds, leading to a mineralized osteoblast-derived microtissue containing, in a 3D setting, viable osteoblastic cells, osteocytic cells, and appropriate expression of osteoblast/osteocyte-derived mRNA and proteins, and mineral content. Direct co-culture of androgen receptor-dependent/independent cell lines (LNCaP, C4-2B, and PC3) led cancer cells to display functional and molecular features as observed in vivo. Co-cultured cancer cells showed increased affinity to the microtissues, as a function of their bone metastatic potential. Co-cultures led to alkaline phosphatase and collagen-I upregulation and sclerostin downregulation, consistent with the clinical marker profile of osteoblastic bone metastases. LNCaP showed a significant adaptive response under androgen deprivation in the microtissues, with the notable appearance of neuroendocrine transdifferentiation features and increased expression of related markers (dopa decarboxylase, enolase 2). Androgen deprivation affected the biology of the metastatic microenvironment with stronger upregulation of androgen receptor, alkaline phosphatase, and dopa decarboxylase, as seen in the transition towards resistance.

To systematically identify microRNAs (miRs) modulating AR activity in lethal disease, hormone-responsive and -resistant PC cells expressing a luciferase-based AR reporter were transfected with a miR inhibitor library; 78 inhibitors significantly altered AR activity. Upon validation, miR-346, miR-361-3p and miR-197 inhibitors markedly reduced AR transcriptional activity, mRNA and protein levels, increased apoptosis, reduced proliferation, repressed EMT, and inhibited PC migration and invasion, demonstrating additive effects with AR inhibition. Corresponding miRs increased AR activity through a novel and anti-dogmatic mechanism of direct association with AR 6.9 kb 3'UTR and transcript stabilisation. In addition, miR-346 and miR-361-3p modulation altered levels of constitutively active AR variants, and inhibited variant-driven PC cell proliferation, so may contribute to persistent AR signalling in CRPC in the absence of circulating androgens. Pathway analysis of AGO-PAR-CLIP-identified miR targets revealed roles in DNA replication and repair, cell cycle, signal transduction and immune function. Silencing these targets, including tumour suppressors ARHGDIA and TAGLN2, phenocopied miR effects, demonstrating physiological relevance.

Implications for hemiablation patient selection""","""Background:   Hemiablation is a less morbid treatment alternative for appropriately selected patients with unilateral prostate cancer (PCa). However, to the authors' knowledge, traditional diagnostic techniques inadequately identify appropriate candidates. In the current study, the authors quantified the accuracy for identifying hemiablation candidates using contemporary diagnostic techniques, including multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) and MRI-fusion with complete systematic template biopsy.  Methods:   A retrospective analysis of patients undergoing MRI and MRI-fusion prostate biopsy, including full systematic template biopsy, prior to radical prostatectomy in a single tertiary academic institution between June 2010 and February 2018 was performed. Hemiablation candidates had unilateral intermediate-risk PCa (Gleason score [GS] of 3+4 or 4+3, clinical T classification ≤T2, and prostate-specific antigen level <20 ng/dL) on MRI-fusion biopsy and 2) no contralateral highly or very highly suspicious Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System version 2 (PI-RADSv2) MRI lesions. Hemiablation candidates were inappropriately selected if pathologists identified contralateral GS ≥3+4 or high-risk ipsilateral PCa on prostatectomy. The authors tested a range of hemiablation inclusion criteria and performed multivariable analysis of preoperative predictors of undetected contralateral disease.  Results:   Of 665 patients, 92 met primary hemiablation criteria. Of these 92 patients, 44 (48%) were incorrectly identified due to ipsilateral GS ≥3+4 tumors crossing the midline (21 patients), undetected distinct contralateral GS ≥3+4 tumors (20 patients), and/or ipsilateral high-risk PCa (3 patients) on prostatectomy. The rate of undetected contralateral disease ranged from 41% to 48% depending on inclusion criteria. On multivariable analysis, men with anterior index tumors were found to be 2.4 times more likely to harbor undetected contralateral GS ≥3+4 PCa compared with men with posterior lesions (P < .05).

Methods:   Data regarding 4073 men (1344 African American men; 33%) who were treated with RP were categorized based on the 5-tiered GrGp system. Logistic regression was used to test the association between biopsy GrGp and PSA nadir (<0.1 ng/mL) after RP as well as adverse pathological features among all patients and stratified by race.  Results:   Those patients with a higher biopsy GrGp were found to have lower odds of achieving a PSA nadir <0.1 ng/mL after RP on unadjusted and multivariable analysis (both P < .001). On unadjusted and multivariable analysis, higher GrGp was associated with increased odds of each of the adverse pathological features, namely, GrGp ≥3, extraprostatic extension, seminal vesicle invasion, positive surgical resection margin, and positive lymph nodes (all P < .001). Race had no significant interaction with biopsy GrGp in the prediction of PSA nadir after RP (P = .91) or any adverse pathological features (all P > .06) except positive lymph nodes. When the models were stratified by race, the associations between preoperative biopsy GrGp and having a PSA nadir <0.1 ng/mL, high-grade final pathology, or other adverse histopathologic features were similar in both races except as noted for positive lymph nodes.  Conclusions:   Higher preoperative biopsy GrGp is associated with increased odds of adverse histopathological findings as well as lower odds of a PSA nadir <0.1 ng/mL after RP. These associations are largely independent of race, suggesting that GrGp is an accurate tool for risk stratification in both black and white men.""","""['Alireza Aminsharifi', 'Ariel Schulman', 'Lauren E Howard', 'Kae Jack Tay', 'Christopher L Amling', 'William J Aronson', 'Matthew R Cooperberg', 'Christopher J Kane', 'Martha K Terris', 'Stephen J Freedland', 'Thomas J Polascik']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Cancer""","""['Predictors of adverse pathologic features after radical prostatectomy in low-risk prostate cancer.', 'Race as an outcome predictor after radical prostatectomy: results from the Shared Equal Access Regional Cancer Hospital (SEARCH) database.', 'Multivariate analysis of race and adverse pathologic findings after radical prostatectomy.', 'Race is not an independent predictor of biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy in an equal access medical center.', 'The 2019 Genitourinary Pathology Society (GUPS) White Paper on Contemporary Grading of Prostate Cancer.', 'Clinicopathological Significances of Positive Surgical Resection Margin after Radical Prostatectomy for Prostatic Cancers: A Meta-Analysis.', 'Evaluating Incidence, Location, and Predictors of Positive Surgical Margin Among Chinese Men Undergoing Robot-Assisted Radical Prostatectomy.', 'Diagnostic performance of a nomogram incorporating cribriform morphology for the prediction of adverse pathology in prostate cancer at radical prostatectomy.']"""

Aim:   To gain consensus on the patient assessment skills required by pharmacist independent prescribers prescribing systemic anti-cancer therapy for genitourinary cancer (prostate and renal) and lung cancer across National Health Service Scotland.  Method:   Two phases were performed to generate patient assessment skill consensus. Initially, the Nominal Group Technique was performed within a local cancer network by discussion and participant ranking within genitourinary and lung cancer multi-disciplinary teams. Where consensus was achieved, patient assessment skills were carried forward to try to achieve national (National Health Service Scotland) consensus using a two-round Delphi questionnaire.  Results:   Of the 27 patient assessment skills, consensus was gained for 21 and 23 patient assessment skills in the genitourinary and lung Nominal Group Technique groups, respectively. Within the genitourinary and lung national groups, 13/21 and 18/23 patient assessment skills were agreed as required for a pharmacist independent prescriber to prescribe systemic anti-cancer therapy in genitourinary and lung cancer, respectively. Eight common patient assessment skills were identified as core skills. Reasons for not reaching consensus included pharmacist independent prescriber competence, knowledge, skills and the roles and responsibilities of pharmacist independent prescribers within the multi-disciplinary team.

This approach is effective but associated with genitourinary and rectal side effects. Focal therapy of prostate cancer has been proposed as an alternative. The aim of this study was to determine the oncologic and functional outcomes of focal high intensity focused ultrasound therapy of prostate cancer.  Materials and methods:   In this single center, prospective study 75 men were treated between April 2014 and April 2018. Multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging and transperineal template saturation prostate biopsy were performed to localize prostate cancer, followed by focal ablation with high intensity focused ultrasound. The study primary end point was the detection of clinically significant prostate cancer, defined as Gleason score 7 or greater, at 6-month followup transperineal template saturation prostate biopsy. Genitourinary side effects were of secondary interest.  Results:   Median patient age was 67 years (IQR 60-71) and median prostate specific antigen was 5.87 ng/ml (IQR 4.65-7.44). There were 5 low risk (6.7%) and 70 intermediate risk (93.3%) cancers. Clinically significant prostate cancer was detected in 41% of the men (95% CI 30.3-53.0) who underwent biopsy at 6 months and the median number of sampled cores was 44 (IQR 36-44). Prostate specific antigen (OR 1.17, IQR 0.49-2.85, p=0.71) and multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (14.3% sensitivity, IQR 6.7-31.5) performed poorly to predict positive biopsies. Pad-free continence and erection sufficient for penetration were preserved in 63 of 64 (98.4%) and 31 of 45 patients (68.9%), respectively.

Methods:   We used spheroids cultured in serum-free culture medium to obtain liver cancer stem cells. Flow cytometric analysis was performed to investigate percentage of CD133+ cells in liver cancer cells. Real-time polymerase chain reaction and western blot were used to assess gene expression in cell lines. Transwell and wound healing assays were performed to indicate cell migration of HCC.  Results:   Secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine was upregulated in spheres formation in HCC cells. Overexpression of SPARC enhanced the ability to form tumor spheres and increased CD133 and Oct4 expressions. Besides, SPARC promoted the migration and epithelial-mesenchymal transition in HCC cells. Importantly, SPARC overexpression stimulated the formation of subcutaneous tumors in nude mice.

Depending on the superfamily member, Parp enzymes can mono- or poly-ADP-ribosylate a protein substrate. Parp superfamily members confer regulation to a variety of biological processes that include cell signaling, DNA repair, transcription, and stress responses. Here, we describe biochemical methods for detection of ADP-ribose conjugated to the androgen receptor (AR) using the archaeal macrodomain, AF1521, from Archaeoglobus fulgidus. The utility of AF1521 is based on its highly selective recognition of ADP-ribose conjugated to protein. AF1521 immobilized on beads can be used to enrich for ADP-ribosylated proteins, which in our application results in recovery of ADP-ribosylated AR from prostate cancer cell extracts. We engineered tandem AF1521 macrodomains and found this improves the recovery of ADP-ribosylated AR under native conditions, and it enabled development of an assay for detection of ADP-ribosylation on blots.

Research is lacking on the role of AREG in invasive breast cancer and the co-expression with androgen receptor (AR) status.  Materials and methods:   The present study investigated the prognostic role of AREG in invasive breast cancer cases (N = 298) and the co-expression with the AR status as analysed by immunohistochemistry (IHC).  Results:   The samples were divided into groups according to AREG expression levels: low/no expression (AREGlow/no) and high expression (AREGhigh). As shown by cytoplasmic immunostaining, 46.0% (137/298) of invasive breast cancers were AREGhigh, and 54.0% (161/298) of cases were AREGlow/no. Co-expression of the AR and AREG accounted for 62.4% (186/298) of cases. A Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed that AREGhigh and AR+/AREGhigh decreased patients' overall survival (OS) (P = 0.002 and P = 0.006, respectively) and disease-free survival (DFS) (P < 0.001 and P < 0.001, respectively). In Cox models, AR+/AREGhigh remained an independent prognostic indicator of OS and DFS in invasive breast cancer (hazard ratio [HR], 0.591, 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.407-0.859, P = 0.006; HR, 0.449, 95% CI, 0.236-0.853, P = 0.014, respectively). AREGhigh remained an independent prognostic indicator of OS and DFS in estrogen receptor (ER)-negative tumours (P < 0.05).  Conclusions:   This study suggested that AREG and the AR were co-expressed in invasive breast cancer.

A novel algorithm is proposed for generation of MLC segments to deliver an FMO plan with step-and-shoot IMRT while minimising quality loss. All beams are considered simultaneously while generating MLC segments for reproducing the 3D FMO dose distribution. Segment generation is only steered by the 3D FMO dose distribution, i.e. underlying FMO fluence profiles are not considered. The algorithm features prioritised generation of segments, focusing on accurate reproduction of clinical objectives with the highest priorities. The performance of the segmentation algorithm was evaluated for 20 prostate patients, 15 head-and-neck patients, and 12 liver patients. FMO dose distributions were generated by automated multi-criteria treatment planning (Pareto-optimal plans) and subsequently segmented using the proposed method. Various segmentation strategies were investigated regarding prioritisation of objectives and limitation of the number of segments. Segmented plans were dosimetrically similar to FMO plans and for all patients a clinically acceptable segmented plan could be generated. Substantial differences between FMO and segmented fluence profiles were observed. Avoidance of the usual reconstruction of 2D FMO fluence profiles for segment generation, and instead simultaneously generating segments for all beams to directly reproduce the 3D FMO dose distribution is a likely explanation for the obtained results. For the strategies of limiting the number of segments large reductions in number of segments were observed with minimal impact on plan quality.""","""['B W K Schipaanboord', 'S Breedveld', 'L Rossi', 'M Keijzer', 'B Heijmen']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Phys Med Biol""","""['Fully automated treatment planning for MLC-based robotic radiotherapy.', 'Accurate 3D-dose-based generation of MLC segments for robotic radiotherapy.', 'Dose domain regularization of MLC leaf patterns for highly complex IMRT plans.', 'Pre-segmented 2-Step IMRT with subsequent direct machine parameter optimisation - a planning study.', 'Segmentation of IMRT plans for radical lung radiotherapy delivery with the step-and-shoot technique.', 'Fully automated treatment planning for MLC-based robotic radiotherapy.', 'Reducing the Risk of Secondary Lung Cancer in Treatment Planning of Accelerated Partial Breast Irradiation.', 'Automatic configuration of the reference point method for fully automated multi-objective treatment planning applied to oropharyngeal cancer.']"""

Our in vitro assays in transiently transfected HEK293 cells, however, show that 11αOHP4 is a potent inhibitor of 11βHSD2 and while this steroid does not serve as a substrate for the enzyme, the aforementioned C11-oxy steroids are indeed substrates for both 11βHSD isozymes. 11βOHP4 is metabolised by 11βHSD2 yielding 11-ketoprogesterone with 11βHSD1 catalysing the reverse reaction, similar to the reduction of the other C11-oxy steroids. In the same model system, novel 11αOHP4 metabolites were detected in its conversion by steroid-5α-reductase (SRD5A) types 1 and 2 yielding 11α-hydroxydihydroprogesterone and its conversion by cytochrome P450 17A1 (CYP17A1) yielding the hydroxylase product, 11α,17α-dihydroxyprogesterone, and the 17,20 lyase product, 11α-hydroxyandrostenedione. We also detected both 11αOHP4 and 11βOHP4 in prostate cancer tissue- ∼23 and ∼32 ng/g respectively with 11KP4 levels >300 ng/g. In vitro assays in PC3 and LNCaP prostate cancer cell models, showed that the metabolism of 11αOHP4 and 11βOHP4 was comparable. In LNCaP cells expressing CYP17A1, 11αOHP4 and 11βOHP4 were metabolised with negligible substrate, 4%, remaining after 48 h, while the steroid substrate 11β,17α-dihydroxyprogesterone (21dF) was metabolised to C11-keto C19 steroids yielding 11-ketotestosterone. Despite the fact that 11αOHP4 is not metabolised by 11βHSD2, it is a substrate for SRD5A and CYP17A1, yielding C11α-hydroxy C19 steroids as well as the C11α-hydroxy derivative of 21dF-the latter associated with clinical conditions characterised by androgen excess. With our data showing that 11αOHP4 is present at high levels in prostate cancer tissue, the steroid may serve as a precursor to unique C11α-hydroxy C19 steroids.

Objective:   To estimate average direct health care costs in the year following cancer diagnosis among cancer patients receiving psychotropic polypharmacy compared with those without psychotropic polypharmacy, using a multivariable analysis framework.  Methods:   A retrospective cross-sectional study was conducted among patients aged 18 years and older diagnosed with the most commonly occurring cancers (breast, prostate, lung, and colorectal) in the United States during 2011-2012 using the deidentified Optum Clinformatics Data Mart commercial claims database. Psychotropic polypharmacy was defined as concurrent use of 2 or more psychotropic medications for at least 90 days. Direct health care costs in the year following cancer diagnosis were estimated as total medical payments made by the health plans and were derived from claims files. A generalized linear regression model with log-link function and gamma distribution was used to model average direct health care costs, controlling for baseline patient demographic and clinical covariates.  Results:   Average annual direct health care costs for cancer patients with psychotropic polypharmacy ($53,497; SD $72,590) were higher than those without psychotropic polypharmacy ($38,255; SD $59,844), with an unadjusted average cost difference of $15,242 (P < 0.0001). In the adjusted regression model, the average difference in costs shrunk to $5,888 but remained notable. When examined by type of cancer, average direct health care costs for all cancer patients with psychotropic polypharmacy were significantly higher than those for patients without psychotropic polypharmacy, except for colorectal cancer patients.  Conclusions:   Overall health care costs were higher among cancer patients with psychotropic polypharmacy compared with those without psychotropic polypharmacy. Our findings support the need for future research to better understand the benefits and risks of psychotropic polypharmacy, given its potential to cause adverse health outcomes and avoidable health care utilization and costs for this vulnerable patient population.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS. One hundred fifty patients underwent 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT or PET/MRI, and the images were interpreted by two blinded board-certified radiologists. Each reader evaluated for the presence or absence of PSMA-positive disease within the prostate bed, pelvic lymph nodes, bones, and soft tissues (extrapelvic lymph nodes and visceral structures). The presence or absence of disease was confirmed by histopathologic analysis if available. For patients who did not have pathologic analysis, a composite of imaging and clinical follow-up was used as the reference standard. RESULTS. The median prostate-specific antigen level was 2.1 ng/mL. Forty-three patients had pathologic correlation, and for 29 patients a composite of imaging and follow-up was used to determine the presence or absence of disease. With substantial to almost perfect interreader reliability by region (κ = 0.78-0.87), 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET had high sensitivity per region (up to 100%) and per patient (up to 89.8%). It also had high positive predictive value per region (up to 100%) and per patient (up to 91.5%). Sensitivity was highest for bone metastases and lowest for soft-tissue metastases.

Quantitative mpMRI metrics-apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), T2, and dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) signal enhancement rate (α)-were calculated on a voxel-by-voxel basis for the whole prostate and coregistered. A normalized risk value (0-100) for each mpMRI parameter was obtained, with high risk values associated with low T2 and ADC and high signal enhancement rate. The final risk score was calculated as a weighted sum of the risk scores (ADC, 40%; T2, 40%; DCE, 20%). Data from five patients were used as training set to find the threshold for predicting PCa. In the other 25 patients, any region with a minimum of 30 con-joint voxels (≈ 4.8 mm2) with final risk score above the threshold was considered positive for cancer.

Patients and methods:   Three hundred and forty two patients with suspected prostate cancer were evaluated with mpMR and prostate biopsy. Agreement between imaging findings and histopathological findings was assessed using the Kappa index. The accuracy of mpMR in relation to biopsy was assessed by calculations of sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV).  Results:   A total of 342 biopsies were performed. In 201 (61.4%), mpMR had a negative result for cancer, which was confirmed on biopsy in 182 (53%) of the cases, 17 (4.9%) presented non-clinically significant cancer and only 2 (0.5%) clinically significant cancer. 131 (38.3%) patients had a positive biopsy. Clinically significant cancer corresponded to 83 (34.2%), of which 81 (97.5%) had a positive result in mpMR. Considering only the clinically significant cancers the mpMR had a sensitivity of 97.6%, specificity of 76.8%, PPV 57.4% and VPN of 99%.

Good or bad notice?""","""Purpose:   To evaluate the trend of use of Prostate Specifi c Antigen (PSA) for screening of prostate cancer (PC) among Brazilian doctors, from the beginning of its regular availability in clinical laboratories.  Material and methods:   A serial cross-sectional study was performed using data obtained from a large database between 1997 and 2016. The general PSA screening trend during this period, adjusted for the total number of exams performed in men, was analyzed. Time-series analysis was performed through observation of the general regression curve using the generalized least squares method, and the impact of the recommendations was assessed with autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models.  Results:   During the period studied 2,521,383 PSA determinations were done. The age of the participants ranged from 21 to 111 years, with an average of 56.7 ± 22.7 years. The relative number of PSA tests/100.000 exams in males showed a constant reduction since 2001, and this trend was more evident in the group aged 55-69 years. Although statistically signifi cant, the impact of reduced PSA screening after the 2012 USPSTF publication was clinically irrelevant.  Conclusions:   Our results indicated a continuous reduction in the use of PSA screening over time, regardless of the publication of recommendations or clinical guidelines. The fact that this trend was more pronounced among those with a greater benefi t potential (55-69 years), relative to groups with a greater damage potential due to overdiagnosis and overtreatment (aged >74 years and < 40 years), is a matter of concern.

To date, transurethral resection remains a controversial treatment for non-functional PUB. This study aimed to identify the clinical features, pathological characteristics, prognosis, and safe/effective treatment of non-functional PUB using transurethral resection of the bladder tumor (TURBT).  Materials and methods:   The clinical records, radiological data, pathological characteristics and follow-up times were retrospectively reviewed in 10 patients with clinically and pathologically proven non-functional PUB in our hospital from January 2008 to November 2016. All patients underwent TURBT treatment.  Results:   The incidence of non-functional PUB in patients with bladder cancer was 0.17%. The mean age at diagnosis was 44.5 ± 13.6 years (range, 29-70 years), and the patient population had a female: male ratio of 3: 2. No patients had excess catecholamine (CA) whilst four patients had painless hematuria. All neoplasms were completely resected via TURBT. The majority of samples were positive for immunohistochemical markers including chromogranin A (CgA) and Synaptophysin (Syn), but were negative for cytokeratins (CKs). Only a single recurrence was observed from the mean follow-up period of 36.4 ± 24.8 months.  Conclusion:   Complete TURBT is a safe and effi cient treatment that serves both diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. Histopathological and immunohistochemistry examinations are mandatory for diagnostic confi rmation.

Odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were utilized to investigate the relationship between three AXIN2 variants (rs2240308 C/T, rs1133683 C/T, and rs4791171 A/G) and overall cancer susceptibility. In silico tools were undertaken to investigate the correlation of AXIN2 expression with cancer risk and survival time. Furthermore, we explored the serum expression of AXIN2 by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. A total of 4167 cancer patients and 3515 control subjects were evaluated. The overall results demonstrated that there was no major association of these polymorphisms on cancer risk. However, stratified analysis by cancer type showed evidence that rs2240308 C/T polymorphism had a lower risk in lung cancer (OR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.63-0.92; Pheterogeneity = 0.865) and prostate cancer (OR, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.35-0.84; Pheterogeneity = 0.088) by heterozygote comparison. Similar results were indicated in Asian descendants and population-based studies. In silico analysis showed evidence that AXIN2 expressions in lung cancer and prostate cancer were lower than that in normal counterpart. High expression of AXIN2 may have longer overall survival time than low expression group for lung cancer participants. In addition, individuals who were CC/TC carriers had a higher serum expression level than TT carriers. In conclusion, this pooled analysis suggested that AXIN2 rs2240308 C/T variant may decrease both lung and prostate cancer susceptibility, particularly in Asian descendants and population-based studies.

Methods: In order to determine the cytotoxic and apoptotic effects of the combination of NOB and SOR, WST-1, Annexin V, and cell cycle analysis were performed. The potential molecular mechanism of apoptotic cell death was assessed by Bax, Bcl-2, CCDN1, Rb1, and CDKN1A gene expression and acridine orange (AO) and DAPI staining. Results: Our results indicated that NOB and SOR combination had a significant inhibitory effect on the viability of PC-3 cells with less toxicity on HUVEC cells than SOR alone (P < 0.01). NOB and SOR combination significantly caused much more apoptotic cell death and cell cycle arrest at G0/G1 phase by up-regulation of Bax, Rb1, and CDKN1A levels in PC-3 cells (P < 0.01). Therefore, strong synergistic effects between NOB and SOR were analyzed (CI < 1).

Methods:   We propose two benchmarks for assessing the narrow-sense validity of GRS. The baseline benchmark requires that the mean GRS value in a general population approximates 1.0. The calibration benchmark assesses the agreement between observed risks and estimated risks (GRS values). We assessed benchmark performance for three prostate cancer (PCa) GRS tests, derived from three SNP panels with increasing stringency of selection criteria, in a PCa chemoprevention trial where 714 of 3225 men were diagnosed with PCa during the 4-year follow-up.  Results:   GRS from Panels 1, 2, and 3 were all statistically associated with PCa risk; P = 5.58 × 10-3 , P = 1 × 10-3 , and P = 1.5 × 10-13 , respectively (broad-sense validity). For narrow-sense validity, the mean GRS value among men without PCa was 1.33, 1.09, and 0.98 for Panels 1, 2, and 3, respectively (baseline benchmark). For assessing the calibration benchmark, observed risks were calculated for seven groups of men with GRS values <0.3, 0.3-0.79, 0.8-1.19, 1.2-1.49, 1.5-1.99, 2-2.99, and ≥3. The calibration slope (higher is better) was 0.15, 0.12, and 0.60, and the bias score (lower is better) between the observed risks and GRS values was 0.08, 0.08, and 0.02 for Panels 1, 2, and 3, respectively.

To date, no systemic therapy given prior to surgery has been shown to improve outcomes. The phosphatidilinositol 3-kinase/AKT/mTOR pathway is commonly dysregulated in men with prostate cancer. We sought to determine the clinical efficacy and safety of the mTOR/TORC1 inhibitor everolimus in men with high-risk prostate cancer undergoing radical prostatectomy. Methods This is a randomized phase II study of everolimus at two different doses (5 and 10 mg daily) given orally for 8 weeks before radical prostatectomy in men with high-risk prostate cancer. The primary endpoint was the pathologic response (histologic P0, margin status, extraprostatic extension) and surgical outcomes. Secondary endpoints included changes in serum PSA level and treatment effects on levels of expression of mTOR, p4EBP1, pS6 and pAKT. Results Seventeen patients were enrolled: nine at 10 mg dose and eight at 5 mg dose. No pathologic complete responses were observed and the majority of patients (88%) had an increase in their PSA values leading to this study being terminated early due to lack of clinical efficacy. Treatment-related adverse events were similar to those previously reported with the use of everolimus in other solid tumors and no additional surgical complications were observed. A significant decrease in the expression of p4EBP1 was noted in prostatectomy samples following treatment.

Their use in clinical settings, however, has been limited owing to lack of simple and robust isolation methods. To rectify this problem, a centrifugal device for automatic, fast, and efficient isolation of EVs from whole-blood, called Exodisc-B is presented in this paper. Methods: The device comprises a built-in chamber to facilitate plasma separation and two nanoporous filters-one for removing larger particles and the other for enriching EVs. The performance of the device in comparison to ultracentrifugation (UC) was evaluated by analyzing the yield, purity, protein and RNA content of the isolated EVs. Additionally, the EV protein marker expressions were measured by ELISA and statistically analyzed to differentiate prostate cancer patients from healthy donors. Results: Compared with the UC technique, the proposed device is capable of isolating at least an order of magnitude higher number of EVs with about 30-fold higher mRNA count within 40 min. Sandwich ELISA of EV-specific membrane proteins-CD9-CD81-confirmed that Exodisc-B can isolate EVs from a volume of whole blood as low as 30 µL with a capture efficiency exceeding 75%. The device also facilitates temporal monitoring of tumor progression within live mouse xenograft models over a period of 13 weeks while using minimal volumes of weekly collected blood samples. Further, in ELISA analyses of multiple cancer-related proteins, such as prostate-specific antigen (PSA), prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA), epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM), epidermal growth factor receptor 1 (EGFR1), and heat shock protein 90 (HSP90), extracted from EVs isolated from human plasma, 43 patients were differentiated from 30 healthy donors.

Yet, it commonly includes misclassified causes of death. Since the NDI is frequently relied upon in studies that evaluate outcomes following radical prostatectomy (RP) for prostate cancer (PC), we evaluated its validity by referencing mortality data from the Shared Equal Access Regional Cancer Hospital (SEARCH) database which is a prospectively managed database of 5009 Veterans who underwent a RP at eight Veterans Affairs medical centers between 1982 and 2016.  Methods:   We compared vital status, cause of death and date of death from the SEARCH database with the NDI.  Results:   A total of 1312 men in SEARCH were deceased, yet the NDI reported 17% (219) of those men as still alive. Among the 1093 men who had concordant vital status in both SEARCH and NDI, the date of death was an exact match within one day, a week, or 31 days in 94%, 97%, 99%, and 100%, respectively. Of those men coded as dying from prostate cancer in the SEARCH database (n = 105), 12% were coded as having died from non-PC causes in the NDI. Meanwhile, among patients coded by the NDI as having died of PC (n = 139), 34% were coded in SEARCH as having died of non-PC causes.  Conclusions:   These findings demonstrate that the NDI provides accurate dates of death, but frequently misclassifies whether a death was due to prostate cancer. Studies that rely upon death certificates, as captured in the NDI, may be unreliable to report prostate cancer-specific mortality rates after prostatectomy.""","""['Drew Moghanaki', 'Lauren E Howard', 'Amanda De Hoedt', 'William J Aronson', 'Christopher J Kane', 'Christopher L Amling', 'Matthew R Cooperberg', 'Martha K Terris', 'Stephen J Freedland']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Prostate Cancer Prostatic Dis""","""['Impact of prior local therapy on overall survival in men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer: Results from Shared Equal Access Regional Cancer Hospital.', 'Obesity and prostate cancer-specific mortality after radical prostatectomy: results from the Shared Equal Access Regional Cancer Hospital (SEARCH) database.', 'Radical prostatectomy versus deferred treatment for localised prostate cancer.', 'New Prostate Cancer Grading System Predicts Long-term Survival Following Surgery for Gleason Score 8-10 Prostate Cancer.', 'Laparoscopic and robotic-assisted versus open radical prostatectomy for the treatment of localised prostate cancer.', 'Impact of race/ethnicity and language preferences on pediatric ALL survival outcomes.', 'Risk of Prostate Cancer in US Veterans With Rheumatoid Arthritis.', 'Trends in Cardiometabolic and Cancer Multimorbidity Prevalence and Its Risk With All-Cause and Cause-Specific Mortality in U.S. Adults: Prospective Cohort Study.', 'Diabetes and Prostate Cancer Outcomes in Obese and Nonobese Men After Radical Prostatectomy.', 'Retrospective cohort study evaluating clinical, biochemical and pharmacological prognostic factors for prostate cancer progression using primary care data.']"""

It has also been altered in cancers such as glioblastoma, breast carcinoma, and prostate cancer making it an emerging therapeutic target. Among the human HtrAs, HtrA4 is the least characterized protease pertaining to both structure and its functions. Although the members of human HtrA family share a significant structural and functional conservation, subtle structural changes have been associated with certain distinct functional requirements. Therefore, intricate dissection of HtrA4 structural and functional properties becomes imperative to understand its role in various biological and pathophysiological processes. Here, using inter-disciplinary approaches including in silico, biochemical and biophysical studies, we have done a domain-wise dissection of HtrA4 to delineate the roles of the domains in regulating oligomerization, stability, protease activity, and specificity. Our findings distinctly demonstrate the importance of the N-terminal region in oligomerization, stability and hence the formation of a functional enzyme. In silico structural comparison of HtrA4 with other human HtrAs, enzymology studies and cleavage assays with X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP) show overall structural conservation and allosteric mode of protease activation, which suggest functional redundancy within this protease family. However, significantly lower protease activity as compared with HtrA2 indicates an additional mode of regulation of the protease activity in the cellular milieu.

Although genetic variants in sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) were reported to be correlated with serum testosterone level, the association with serum testosterone during ADT remains unclear. Therefore, this study investigated the impact of a missense polymorphism in the SHBG gene among men treated with primary ADT for metastatic prostate cancer.  Patients and methods:   This study included 104 Japanese men with metastatic prostate cancer. The association of SHBG gene polymorphism (rs6259, D356N) with clinicopathologic parameters including serum testosterone levels during ADT, as well as prognosis, including progression-free survival and overall survival, was examined.  Results:   The serum testosterone levels during ADT were comparable between men carrying the homozygous wild-type (GG) and heterozygous/homozygous variant (GA/AA) in the SHBG gene. When adjusted for age, Gleason score, initial prostate-specific antigen, and clinical T-stage, the heterozygous/homozygous variant (GA/AA) in the SHBG gene was associated with a higher risk of progression (hazard ratio, 2.20; 95% confidence interval, 1.10-4.18; P = .027) and any-cause death (hazard ratio, 3.21; 95% confidence interval, 1.31-7.35; P = .012).

However, studies rarely report comparisons with CTC counts and biopsy AR-V7 protein expression.  Objective:   To determine the reproducibility of AdnaTest CTC AR-V7 testing, and associations with clinical characteristics, CellSearch CTC counts, tumour biopsy AR-V7 protein expression and overall survival (OS).  Design, setting, and participants:   CTC AR-V7 status was determined for 227 peripheral blood samples, from 181 mCRPC patients with CTC counts (202 samples; 136 patients) and matched mCRPC biopsies (65 samples; 58 patients).  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   CTC AR-V7 status was associated with clinical characteristics, CTC counts, and tissue biopsy AR-V7 protein expression. The association of CTC AR-V7 status and other baseline variables with OS was determined.  Results and limitations:   Of the samples, 35% were CTC+/AR-V7+. CTC+/AR-V7+ samples had higher CellSearch CTC counts (median CTC; interquartile range [IQR]: 60, 19-184 vs 9, 2-64; Mann-Whitney test p<0.001) and biopsy AR-V7 protein expression (median H-score, IQR: 100, 63-148 vs 15, 0-113; Mann-Whitney test p=0.004) than CTC+/AR-V7- samples. However, both CTC- (63%) and CTC+/AR-V7- (62%) patients had detectable AR-V7 protein in contemporaneous biopsies. After accounting for baseline characteristics, there was shorter OS in CTC+/AR-V7+ patients than in CTC- patients (hazard ratio [HR] 2.13; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.23-3.71; p=0.02); surprisingly, there was no evidence that CTC+/AR-V7+ patients had worse OS than CTC+/AR-V7- patients (HR 1.26; 95% CI 0.73-2.17; p=0.4). A limitation of this study was the heterogeneity of treatment received.  Conclusions:   Studies reporting the prognostic relevance of CTC AR-V7 status must account for CTC counts. Discordant CTC AR-V7 results and AR-V7 protein expression in matched, same-patient biopsies are reported.

This study aims to quantify the variation in daily rectal dose-volume histograms (DVHs) from the treatment plan and to discuss the potential clinical significance of this variation.  Materials and methods:   Daily cone beam computed tomography scans of nine patients treated with definitive prostate intensity-modulated radiation therapy were collected. The daily dose distribution to the rectum was calculated retrospectively. The variation between the planned and on-treatment rectal DVHs was determined using Friedman tests with post hoc analysis and Wilcoxon matched-pairs tests. The on-treatment DVHs were compared with dose-volume constraints (DVCs) to assess the potential clinical significance of this variation using Wilcoxon signed-rank tests.  Results:   Significant variation (P < .05) was observed between the planned and on-treatment DVHs. The DVCs for the volume receiving 50 Gy (V50), V60, and V65 were adhered to. The mean V70 and V75 values were above the DVC; however, this variation was not statistically significant.

Multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) combined with MRI-guided biopsies may aid in defining tumour-dense regions before radiation therapy. Deformable registration techniques may be used to map these tumour regions onto the radiotherapy planning MRI. Radiation therapy delivery techniques such as volumetric modulated arc therapy and high-dose-rate brachytherapy may allow for highly conformal dose escalation, and when coupled with image-guided radiation delivery (ie, cone beam computed technology and fiducial markers), may allow high-precision dose-escalated treatment.  Methods:   Eligible prostate cancer patients were enrolled on a prospective trial of tumour dose escalation. Two strategies were investigated: (1) an integrated boost to external beam radiation for a total tumour dose of 95 Gy in 38 fractions or (2) a focal high-dose-rate boost of 10 Gy before 76 Gy in 38 fractions external beam radiation. Patients underwent MRI-guided biopsy with fiducial marker placement before therapy. mpMRI was acquired and used in conjunction with a non-endorectal coil T2 MRI and computed technology simulation images to define the gross tumour volume via a deformable registration approach for intraprostatic tumour dose escalation.  Results:   A case example for each dose escalation strategy illustrates the tumour-targeted approach using MRI guidance.

We hypothesized that the therapeutic pressure of abiraterone is resulting in more clinically aggressive disease at progression, characterized by increased visceral metastases. Our objective was to determine whether abiraterone increased the risk of development of visceral metastases at the time of progression compared with placebo in a randomized phase III trial.  Methods:   We performed a post hoc analysis of the COU-AA-302 trial of abiraterone plus prednisone vs placebo plus prednisone in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. The primary outcome was the development of visceral metastases. The cumulative incidences of visceral metastases were calculated by the Kaplan-Meier method and compared using log-rank testing. Multivariable Cox regression analysis assessed for the independent association of abiraterone with the development of visceral metastases.  Results:   Eighty-four of 1088 patients developed visceral metastases during study. Log-rank testing and Cox regression showed no difference in time to visceral metastases between groups (HR 1.01 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.65-1.56]; P = .97). Abiraterone treatment was not associated with the development of visceral metastases in multivariable analysis (HR 0.89 [95% CI, 0.57-1.40]; P = .62).

The association of 5-ARIs with detection of prostate cancer in a PSA-screened population remains unclear.  Objective:   To test the hypothesis that prediagnostic 5-ARI use is associated with a delayed diagnosis, more advanced disease at diagnosis, and higher risk of prostate cancer-specific mortality and all-cause mortality than use of other or no PSA-decreasing drugs.  Design, setting, and participants:   This population-based cohort study linked the Veterans Affairs Informatics and Computing Infrastructure with the National Death Index to obtain patient records for 80 875 men with American Joint Committee on Cancer stage I-IV prostate cancer diagnosed from January 1, 2001, to December 31, 2015. Patients were followed up until death or December 31, 2017. Data analysis was performed from March 2018 to May 2018.  Exposures:   Prediagnostic 5-ARI use.  Main outcomes and measures:   The primary outcome was prostate cancer-specific mortality (PCSM). Secondary outcomes included time from first elevated PSA (defined as PSA≥4 ng/mL) to diagnostic prostate biopsy, cancer grade and stage at time of diagnosis, and all-cause mortality (ACM). Prostate-specific antigen levels for 5-ARI users were adjusted by doubling the value, consistent with previous clinical trials.  Results:   Median (interquartile range [IQR]) age at diagnosis was 66 (61-72) years; median [IQR] follow-up was 5.90 (3.50-8.80) years. Median time from first adjusted elevated PSA to diagnosis was significantly greater for 5-ARI users than 5-ARI nonusers (3.60 [95% CI, 1.79-6.09] years vs 1.40 [95% CI, 0.38-3.27] years; P < .001) among patients with known prostate biopsy date. Median adjusted PSA at time of biopsy was significantly higher for 5-ARI users than 5-ARI non-users (13.5 ng/mL vs 6.4 ng/mL; P < .001). Patients treated with 5-ARI were more likely to have Gleason grade 8 or higher (25.2% vs 17.0%; P < .001), clinical stage T3 or higher (4.7% vs 2.9%; P < .001), node-positive (3.0% vs 1.7%; P < .001), and metastatic (6.7% vs 2.9%; P < .001) disease than 5-ARI nonusers. In a multivariable regression, patients who took 5-ARI had higher prostate cancer-specific (subdistribution hazard ratio [SHR], 1.39; 95% CI, 1.27-1.52; P < .001) and all-cause (HR, 1.10; 95% CI, 1.05-1.15; P < .001) mortality.  Conclusions and relevance:   Results of this study demonstrate that prediagnostic use of 5-ARIs was associated with delayed diagnosis and worse cancer-specific outcomes in men with prostate cancer. These data highlight a continued need to raise awareness of 5-ARI-induced PSA suppression, establish clear guidelines for early prostate cancer detection, and motivate systems-based practices to facilitate optimal care for men who use 5-ARIs.""","""['Reith R Sarkar', 'J Kellog Parsons', 'Alex K Bryant', 'Stephen T Ryan', 'Andrew K Kader', 'Rana R McKay', ""Anthony V D'Amico"", 'Paul L Nguyen', 'Benjamin J Hulley', 'John P Einck', 'Arno J Mundt', 'Christopher J Kane', 'James D Murphy', 'Brent S Rose']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""JAMA Intern Med""","""['Re: Association of Treatment with 5α-Reductase inhibitors with Time to Diagnosis and Mortality in Prostate Cancer.', 'Re: Association of Treatment with 5α-Reductase Inhibitors with Time to Diagnosis and Mortality in Prostate Cancer.', 'Re: Association of Treatment with 5α-Reductase Inhibitors with Time to Diagnosis and Mortality in Prostate Cancer.', 'Re: Association of Treatment with 5α-Reductase Inhibitors with Time to Diagnosis and Mortality in Prostate Cancer.', 'Benefits of Targeted Use of 5α-Reductase Inhibitors in Patients With Prostate Cancer.', '5α-Reductase Inhibitor Use in Patients With Prostate Cancer.', '5α-Reductase Inhibitor Use in Patients With Prostate Cancer.', '5α-Reductase Inhibitor Use in Patients With Prostate Cancer-Reply.', 'Benefits of Targeted Use of 5α-Reductase Inhibitors in Patients With Prostate Cancer-Reply.', 'Association of 5α-Reductase Inhibitors With Prostate Cancer Mortality.', 'Effect of treatment with 5-α reductase inhibitors on progression in monitored men with favourable-risk prostate cancer.', '5α-Reductase Inhibitors and the Risk of Cancer-Related Mortality in Men With Prostate Cancer.', 'Use of 5alpha-reductase inhibitors for prostate cancer chemoprevention: American Society of Clinical Oncology/American Urological Association 2008 Clinical Practice Guideline.', 'Use of 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors for prostate cancer chemoprevention: American Society of Clinical Oncology/American Urological Association 2008 Clinical Practice Guideline.', 'Association of 5α-Reductase Inhibitor Prescription With Bladder Cancer Progression in Males in South Korea.', 'Association Between 5α-Reductase Inhibitors and Prostate Cancer Mortality: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.', 'The Impact of Lifestyle on Prostate Cancer: A Road to the Discovery of New Biomarkers.', 'Risk of Prostate Cancer in US Veterans With Rheumatoid Arthritis.', 'Rates of False-Negative Screening in Prostate Specific Antigen Secondary to 5-Alpha Reductase Inhibitor Usage: A Quality-Improvement Initiative.']"""

Although the Ral pathway has been implicated in prostate cancer (PCa) development and progression, the significance of RalGAP in PCa has been largely unknown. We examined RalGAPα2 expression using immunohistochemistry on two independent tissue microarray sets. Both datasets demonstrated that the expression of RalGAPα2 was significantly downregulated in PCa tissues compared to adjacent benign prostatic epithelia. Silencing of RalGAPα2 by short hairpin RNA enhanced migration and invasion abilities of benign and malignant prostate epithelial cell lines without affecting cell proliferation. Exogenous expression of wild-type RalGAP, but not the GTPase-activating protein activity-deficient mutant of RalGAP, suppressed migration and invasion of multiple PCa cell lines and was phenocopied by pharmacological inhibition of RalA/B. Loss of Ralgapa2 promoted local microscopic invasion of prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia without affecting tumor growth in a Pten-deficient mouse model for prostate tumorigenesis.

These bone metastases can greatly decrease a patient's quality of life, pose a financial burden, and even result in death. In recent years, tumor cell-secreted microvesicles have been identified and proposed to be a key factor in cell interaction. However, the impact of cancer-derived exosomes on bone cells remains unclear. Herein, we isolated exosomes from prostate cancer cell line PC-3 and investigated their effects on human osteoclast differentiation by tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) staining. The potential mechanism was evaluated by qRT-PCR, western blotting, and microRNA transfection experiments. The results showed that PC-3-derived exosomes dramatically inhibited osteoclast differentiation. Marker genes of mature osteoclasts, including CTSK, NFATc1, ACP5, and miR-214, were all downregulated in the presence of PC-3 exosomes. Furthermore, transfection experiments showed that miR-214 downregulation severely impaired osteoclast differentiation, whereas overexpression of miR-214 promoted differentiation. Furthermore, we demonstrated that PC-3-derived exosomes block the NF-κB signaling pathway. Our study suggested that PC-3-derived exosomes inhibit osteoclast differentiation by downregulating miR-214 and blocking the NF-κB signaling pathway.

Different from other nuclear receptors that bind to the co-regulator LxxLL motif in coregulator peptide interaction, the AR Ligand Binding Domain (LBD) prefers to bind to the FxxLF motif. BUD31, a novel co-regulator with FxxLF motif, has been demonstrated to suppress wild-type and mutated AR-mediated prostate cancer growth.  Methods:   To find out the interaction mechanisms of BUD31 with WT/T877A/W741L AR complex, molecular dynamics simulations were employed to study the complex BUD31 and WT/mutant ARs.

Methods:   Retrospective analysis of publicly accessible Medicare claims data was performed for the period 2001-2016 and included patients undergoing radical prostatectomy with or without pelvic lymphadenectomy relative to total and PCa-specific populations among men aged 45-84 years. Proportion of cases performed robotically was considered.  Results:   Total procedures performed increased from 2001, peaked in 2009 and subsequently decreased until 2016. Since 2009, the age-specific rate of surgery in men aged 75-84 increased by 2.3-fold, whereas the rates for men aged 55-64 and 45-54 reduced by 44% and 55%, respectively. Rates of concurrent pelvic lymphadenectomy fell until 2009 with subsequent stabilization (ratio 1.05-1.14) through to 2016. Significant regional practice patterns were observed, as was an increasing trend toward a robotic-assisted laparoscopic approach, comprising more than 80% of radical prostatectomies in 2016.

We aimed to investigate the hospital-level contribution to overtreatment in the United States.  Methods:   Using the National Cancer Database we identified two nonoverlapping cohorts: (1) men with a life expectancy <10 years harbouring low or intermediate risk PCa (2) men with life expectancy ≥10 years with low-risk PCa. Multivariable mixed models with patient characteristics as fixed and hospital-level intercept as random effect were used to assess the hospital-level risk-adjusted probability of definitive treatment in both groups. Pearson's correlation coefficient was calculated to investigate the correlation between the hospitals probabilities of treating patients of both cohorts.  Results:   We found 33,431 men with a life expectancy <10 years and 122,514 men with a life expectancy ≥10 years and low-risk PCa. In the latter, the probability of treatment ranged from 29.0% in the bottom to 90.0% in the top decile and from 35.0% to 88.0% for men with a life expectancy <10 years. Age and race were independent predictors of low-value treatment in both cohorts. The correlation between 1,225 hospitals treating men of both cohorts was strong (Pearson's r = 0.66, P < 0.001).  Conclusion:   There is wide hospital-level variability in low-value treatment of men with limited life expectancies and low-risk PCa.

However, the small field sizes associated with this method are a possible source of dosimetrical uncertainties. The IAEA has published detector-specific field output correction factors for static fields of the TomoTherapy in the TRS483. This work investigates the average subfield size of helical TomoTherapy plans.  Material and methods:   A new parameter for helical TomoTherapy was defined - the fluence-weighted average subfield size. The subfield sizes were extracted from the leaf-opening time sinograms in the RT-plan files for 30 clinical prostate and head and neck plans and were put in relation to Delat4 Phantom+ measurement results. Additionally the influence of planning parameters on the subfield size was studied by varying the modulation factor, number of iterations and pitch in the dose optimization and calculation for three different clinical indications H&N, prostate and rectum cancer. Selected plans were dosimetrically verified by Delta4 measurements to examine the reliability in dependence of the average subfield size. Furthermore, the impact of the planning parameters on a) the dose distribution, with regard to the planning target volume and regions at risks, and b) machine characteristics such as delivery time, actual modulation factor and leaf-opening times were evaluated.  Results:   The average equivalent square subfield lengths (s¯eq) of the two investigated indications did not differ significantly - prostate plans: 2.75±0.14cm and H&N plans: 2.70±0.16cm, both with a jaw width of 2.5cm. No correlation between field size and measured dose deviation was detected. The number of iterations and the modulation factor have a considerable influence on the average subfield size. The higher the planned modulation factor and the more iterations are used during optimization, the smaller is the subfield size. In our pilot study plans were calculated with field sizes s¯eq between 4.2cm and 1.7cm, with a jaw width of 2.5cm. Again, the measurement results of Delta4 showed no significant deviation from the doses calculated by the TomoTherapy planning system for the whole range of subfield sizes, and no significant correlation between field sizes and dose deviations was found. As expected, the clinical dose distribution improved with increasing modulation factor and an increasing number of iterations. The compromise between an improved dose distribution and smaller s¯eq was shown.  Conclusion:   In this work, a method was presented to determine the average subfield size for helical TomoTherapy plans. The response of the Delta4 did not show any dependence on field size in the range of the field sizes covered by the studied plans. The influence of the subfield sizes on other dosimetry systems remains to be investigated.""","""['Simon Howitz', 'Tilo Wiezorek', 'Andrea Wittig', 'Hilke Vorwerk', 'Klemens Zink']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Z Med Phys""","""['Independent calculation of dose distributions for helical tomotherapy using a conventional treatment planning system.', 'Treatment plan comparison between helical tomotherapy and MLC-based IMRT using radiobiological measures.', 'Helical tomotherapy with dynamic running-start-stop delivery compared to conventional tomotherapy delivery.', 'Investigation of pitch and jaw width to decrease delivery time of helical tomotherapy treatments for head and neck cancer.', 'Dosimetric effects of rotational output variation and x-ray target degradation on helical tomotherapy plans.']"""

Methods:   The Japan-Multinational Trial Organization Pca10-01 phase II trial was a multicenter, prospective single-arm, phase II trial both in non-metastatic and metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer patients that was organized by The Japan-Multinational Trial Organization. Patients received 75 mg/m2 of docetaxel (every 21 days) and 0.5 mg of dexamethasone orally twice a day continuing throughout the treatment period.

HIPO implemented in Oncentra© Prostate treatment planning system, is used for three-dimensional (3D)-ultrasound-based intraoperative treatment planning in high dose rate brachytherapy. HIPO utilizes a hybrid iterative process to determine the most appropriate placement of a given number of catheters to fulfil predefined dose-volume constraints. The main goals of the current investigation were to identify a way of improving the performance of HIPO inverse planning; accelerating the HIPO, and to evaluate the effect of the two CVT-based initialization methods on the dose distribution in the sub-region of prostate that is not accessible by catheters, when trying to avoid perforation of urethra.  Methods:   We implemented the CVT algorithm to generate initial catheter configurations before the initialization of the HIPO algorithm. We introduced the CCVT algorithm to improve the dose distribution to the sub-volume of prostate within the bounding box of the urethra contours including its upper vertical extension (U-P). For the evaluation, we considered a total of 15 3D ultrasound-based HDRBT prostate implants. Execution time and treatment plan quality were evaluated based on the dose-volume histograms of prostate (PTV), its sub-volume U-P, and organs at risk (OARs). Furthermore, the conformity index COIN, the homogeneity index HI and the complication-free tumor control probability (P+ ) were used for our treatment plan comparisons. Finally, the plans with the recommended HIPO execution mode were compared to the clinically used intraoperative pre-plans.  Results:   The plan quality achieved with CCVT-based HIPO initialization was superior to the default HIPO initialization method. Focusing on the U-P sub-region of the prostate, the CCVT method resulted in a significant improvement of all dosimetric indices compared to the default HIPO, when both were executed in the adaptive mode. For that recommended HIPO execution mode, and for U-P, CCVT demonstrated in general higher dosimetric indices than CVT. Additionally, the execution time of CCVT initialized HIPO was lower compared to both alternative initialization methods. This is also valid for the values of the aggregate objective function with the differences to the default initialization method being highly significant. Paired non-parametric statistical tests (Wilcoxon signed-rank) showed a significant improvement of dose-volume indices, COIN and P+ for the plans generated by the CCVT-based catheter configuration initialization in HIPO compared to the default HIPO initialization process. Furthermore, in ten out of 15 cases, the CCVT-based HIPO plans fulfilled all the clinical dose-volume constraints in a single trial without any need for further catheter position adaption.  Conclusion:   HIPO with CCVT-based initialization demonstrates better performance regarding the aggregate objective function and convergence when compared to the CVT-based and default catheter configuration initialization methods. This improved performance of HIPO inverse planning is clearly not at the cost of the dosimetric and radiobiologically evaluated plan quality. We recommend the use of the CCVT method for HIPO initialization especially in the adaptive planning mode.""","""['Ilias Sachpazidis', 'Jürgen Hense', 'Panayiotis Mavroidis', 'Mark Gainey', 'Dimos Baltas']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Comparison of dose and catheter optimization algorithms in prostate high-dose-rate brachytherapy.', 'Adaptation of the CVT algorithm for catheter optimization in high dose rate brachytherapy.', 'Comparison of IPSA and HIPO inverse planning optimization algorithms for prostate HDR brachytherapy.', 'Use of three-dimensional radiation therapy planning tools and intraoperative ultrasound to evaluate high dose rate prostate brachytherapy implants.', 'Three-dimensional conformal brachytherapy for prostate cancer.', 'Influence of Urethra Sparing on Tumor Control Probability and Normal Tissue Complication Probability in Focal Dose Escalated Hypofractionated Radiotherapy: A Planning Study Based on Histopathology Reference.', 'Comparison of liver exposure in CT-guided high-dose rate (HDR) interstitial brachytherapy versus SBRT in hepatocellular carcinoma.']"""

While lung cancer driver mutations were not detected in transformed clones, more than 300 genes that showed reduced expression associated with promoter methylation in transformed clones or predictive for methylation in malignant tumors were identified. These studies support reduced DNA repair capacity as a key factor in the initiation and clonal expansion of pre-neoplastic cells and double-strand break DNA damage as causal for epigenetic mediated silencing of many lung cancer-associated genes.

While the interplay between these steroid hormones has been established, the interaction between steroid hormone receptors in prostatic disease remains unstudied. The goal of this study was to objectively determine the incidence, stage specificity, and tissue/cell type specificity of AR and ERα expression, both independently and simultaneously, during the progression of PRCA. Using multiplexed immunohistochemistry and multispectral imaging analysis, AR, ERα, and smooth muscle α-actin expression was detected and quantitated in benign prostate tissue (BPT), high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (HGPIN), PRCA, and metastasis (MET) from patient specimens (n=340). Epithelial AR expression was significantly increased in HGPIN, PRCA, and MET compared with BPT, whereas ERα expression in epithelial and stromal cells was highest in HGPIN. With analysis of AR and ERα coexpression, we identified a unique population of double-positive (AR+/ERα+) cells that increased in HGPIN specimens in both the stroma and the epithelium. Double-negative (AR-/ERα-) cells significantly decreased across PRCA progression, from 65% in BPT to 30% in MET.

Objective:   To investigate the accuracy of in-bore MRI-guided biopsy of Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) 4 and 5 index lesions alone in biopsy-naive patients undergoing radical prostatectomy (RP).  Design, setting, and participants:   A total of 170 patients underwent MRI-guided in-bore biopsy for PI-RADS 4 and 5 index lesions alone between 2013 and 2018, of whom 136 patients were diagnosed with PCa. Fifty-two patients without prior biopsy who underwent RP were included in this study. MP-MRI findings, biopsy results, and whole-mount step-section specimen evaluation were retrospectively analyzed.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Continuous variables were reported as mean (standard deviation) or median (range). Differences in parametric variables were calculated by Student t test.  Results and limitations:   Overall International Society of Urological Pathology grade group (GG) up- and downgrading rates were 23.0% and 7.6% per patient and 24.5% and 6.5% per focus, respectively. Ten of 12 biopsy-detected GG 1 foci were upgraded in the final pathology. In 30 patients, a total of 43 different tumor foci were identified outside the sampled index lesion. Average biopsied and nonbiopsied tumor volumes were found to be 2.02 and 0.45 cm³, respectively (p < 0.001). The index lesion was the largest focus of tumor in all patients' final histopathological examination; upgrading was identified in only one nonbiopsied focus in a single patient. Limitations include retrospective design and nonstandard indications of in-bore MRI biopsy.  Conclusions:   In-bore MRI-guided biopsy of PI-RADS 4-5 index lesions alone in biopsy-naive patients is a safe and accurate diagnostic modality allowing appropriate patient selection for individualized treatment.

Unlike most interdigitated electrode biosensors, biorecognition happens in between the interdigitated electrodes, which enhances the sensitivity and limit of detection of the sensor. Using the Faradaic mode electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) technique to quantify the PSA antigen, the developed sensing platform demonstrates a logarithmic detection of PSA ranging from 0.5 ng/ml to 5000 ng/ml, an estimated LOD down to 0.51 ng/ml in the serum, and a good sensor's reproducibility. The sensor's detection range covers the clinical threshold value at 4 ng/ml and the crucial diagnosis 'grey zone' of 4-10 ng/ml of PSA in serum for an accurate cancer diagnosis. The selectivity test revealed an excellent discrimination of other competing proteins, with a recorded detection signals at 5 ng/ml PSA as high as 7-fold increase versus the human serum albumin (HSA) and 8-fold increase versus the human glandular kallikrein 2 (hK2). The stability test showed an acceptable stability of the aptasensor recorded at six (6) days before the detection signal started degrading below 10% of the peak detection value. The developed sensing scheme is proven to exhibit a great potential as a portable prostate cancer biosensor, also as a universal platform for bio-molecular sensing with the versatility to implement nanoparticles and other surface chemistry for various applications.""","""['Conlathan Ibau', 'M K Md Arshad', 'Subash C B Gopinath', 'M Nuzaihan M N', 'M F M Fathil', 'Pedro Estrela']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Biosens Bioelectron""","""['Immunosensing prostate-specific antigen: Faradaic vs non-Faradaic electrochemical impedance spectroscopy analysis on interdigitated microelectrode device.', 'Electrochemical bioassay development for ultrasensitive aptasensing of prostate specific antigen.', 'Electrochemical Detection of C-Reactive Protein in Human Serum Based on Self-Assembled Monolayer-Modified Interdigitated Wave-Shaped Electrode.', 'Interdigitated array microelectrodes based impedance biosensors for detection of bacterial cells.', 'A novel classification of prostate specific antigen (PSA) biosensors based on transducing elements.', 'Recent advances in optical aptasensors for biomarkers in early diagnosis and prognosis monitoring of hepatocellular carcinoma.', 'Framing of Poly(arylene-ethynylene) around Carbon Nanotubes and Iodine Doping for the Electrochemical Detection of Dopamine.', 'Gold Nanoparticles-MWCNT Based Aptasensor for Early Diagnosis of Prostate Cancer.', 'Nano-Theranostics for the Sensing, Imaging and Therapy of Prostate Cancers.', 'Advanced nanoengineered-customized point-of-care tools for prostate-specific antigen.']"""

Here bicalutamide is caged by the Ru(II) center through the nitrile group, and three photoactive Ru(II) complexes were designed and synthesized. Docking study showed that the ruthenium(II) fragments can effectively block the binding of complexes 1-3 with AR (androgen receptor) owing to the large steric structures, thus bicalutamide in complexes 1-3 could not interact with AR-LBD (ligand binding domain). Once irradiation with blue light (465nm), complexes 1-3 can release bicalutamide and anticancer Ru(II) fragments, which possesses dual-action of AR binding and DNA interaction simultaneously. In vitro cytotoxicity study on these complexes further confirmed that complexes 1-3 exhibited considerable cytotoxicity upon irradiation with blue light. Significantly, complex 3 could be activated at 660nm, which greatly increases the scope of complex 3 to treat deeper within tissue. Theoretical calculations showed that the lowest singlet excitation energy of complex 3 is lower than those of complexes 1-2, which explains the experimental results well.

Materials and methods:   We analyzed the setup accuracy for 17 consecutive prostate cancer patients with three implanted FMs who underwent hypofractionated IMRT. The 3DOF-ST-based setup using cone-beam computed tomography (CT) was performed after a six DOF-bony structure (BS)-based setup using an ExacTrac x-ray system. The 3DOF-FM-based matching using the ExacTrac x-ray system was done during the BS- and ST-based setups. We determined the mean absolute differences and the correlation between the FM- and ST-based translational shifts relative to the BS-based setup position. The rotational mean shifts detected by the ExacTrac x-ray system were also evaluated.  Results:   The mean differences in the anterior-posterior (AP), superior-inferior (SI), and left-right (LR) dimensions were 0.69, 0.0, and 0.30 mm, respectively.

Docetaxel impairs microtubules, has androgen receptor (AR) inhibitory effects and is used in both the castration resistant and sensitive settings, where androgen dynamics may impact outcome. The present analysis evaluates the association of decline in serum androgen levels (Testosterone (T), Androstenedione (A) and DHEA in docetaxel-treated mCRPC patients with OS.  Methods:   Data from 1050 men treated on CALGB 90401 with docetaxel, prednisone and either bevacizumab or placebo were evaluated. Eligibility required progressive mCRPC and no prior chemotherapy. Pre-treatment, 6 week and progression serum assays for T, A and DHEA were performed via tandem Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Changes in T, A and DHEA levels from baseline to 6 weeks were calculated as the ratio of 6-week over baseline. The proportional hazards model was used to assess the prognostic significance of changes in T, A, and DHEA from baseline to 6 weeks in predicting OS adjusting for known prognostic factors.  Results:   Median baseline values for T, A, and, DHEA were 1.0, 13.5, and 8.1 ng/dL respectively while 6 week levels were 0.64, 7.0, and 6.8 ng/dL respectively. Median OS for low testosterone decline is 20.9 months vs 26.3 months for high testosterone decline. In multivariable analysis including known prognostic variables, change in testosterone levels was independently associated with greater OS; the hazard ratio for death with each unit increase in the 6-week/baseline ratio is 1.02 (95% CI = 1.01-1.03, p = 0.001). Decline in A and DHEA were not significant predictors of OS. In multivariable analysis change in the serum changes did not predict PFS however the ratio of T at 6-weeks over baseline was prognostic of ≥50% decline in PSA with an odds ratio of 0.93 (95% CI = 0.85-0.98, p-value = 0.039).

We evaluated the ability of PET/CT with 89Zr-DFO-MSTP2109A, an antibody that recognizes STEAP1, to detect lesions in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). Methods: Nineteen mCRPC patients were prospectively imaged using approximately 185 MBq/10 mg of 89Zr-DFO-MSTP2109A. 89Zr-DFO-MSTP2109A PET/CT images obtained 4-7 d after injection were compared with bone and CT scans. Uptake in lesions was measured. Fifteen patients were treated with an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) based on MSTP2109A; ADC treatment-related data were correlated with tumor uptake by PET imaging. Bone or soft-tissue biopsy samples were evaluated. Results: No significant toxicity occurred. Excellent uptake was observed in bone and soft-tissue disease. Median SUVmax was 20.6 in bone and 16.8 in soft tissue. Sixteen of 17 lesions biopsied were positive on 89Zr-DFO-MSTP2109A, and all sites were histologically positive (1 on repeat biopsy). Bayesian analysis resulted in a best estimate of 86% of histologically positive lesions being true-positive on imaging (95% confidence interval, 75%-100%). There was no correlation between SUVmax tumor uptake and STEAP1 immunohistochemistry, survival after ADC treatment, number of ADC treatment cycles, or change in prostate-specific antigen level. Conclusion:89Zr-DFO-MSTP2109A is well tolerated and shows localization in mCRPC sites in bone and soft tissue.

Aldol condensation of DHT with acetaldehyde afforded a 2-ethylidene derivative regio- and stereo-selectively, which was reacted with different arylhydrazines in the presence of iodine via microwave-assisted oxidative cyclization reactions. The 17-keto analogs of steroidal pyrazoles were also synthesized by simple oxidation in order to enlarge the compound library available for pharmacological studies and to obtain structure-activity relationship. The antiproliferative activities of the structurally related heteroaromatic compounds were tested in vitro on human cervical and breast adenocarcinoma cell lines (HeLa, MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231) and on two androgen-independent malignant prostate carcinoma cell lines (PC-3 and DU 145). Based on primary cytotoxicity screens and IC50 assessment, a structure-function relationship was identified, as derivatives carrying a hydroxyl group on C-17 exhibit stronger activity compared to the 17-one counterparts. Cancer cell selectivity of the derivatives was also determined using non-cancerous MRC-5 cells. Furthermore, the proapoptotic effects of some selected derivatives were verified on androgen therapy refractive p53-deficient PC-3 cells.

Personnel were instructed to manually adjust the fused images after automatic bony registration matching disease-specific criteria. The Pearson correlation matrix was applied to the summed vector lengths of the personnel's overall translations in all three disease sites. The results were compared with a chosen benchmark personnel and were analyzed for significance in correlation. Finally, the overall translations compared with the automatic bony registration were analyzed for any trends in the data. In each disease site, the average correlation from all personnel compared to a benchmark registering prostate, bladder, and head and neck patients were 0.94, 0.94, and 0.64, respectively. Then, analysis of the interuser overall translations illustrated that each disease site had its own trends with regard to interfraction image fusion corrections. Finally, the mean translational variations were assessed over all personnel for each disease site in X (lateral), Y (longitudinal), and Z (vertical) directional planes.

The detection rate of localized PrC has been dramatically enhanced by screening and the development of visualization methods. There are currently several techniques for focal treatment available, among which the most interesting in our opinion is high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU). Currently, HIFU hemiablation of PrC is not an established treatment, although evidence of its effectiveness and safety is growing. We have been performing HIFU hemiablation since 2013 and here report our results to add to the evidence on the effectiveness of the technique. Between October 2013 and December 2016, we performed HIFU hemiablation of the prostate for a total of 35 patients with confirmed PrC stage <cT2a at our urology clinic and retrospectively examined duration of ablation, pre- and postoperative prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels, prostate volume, erectile function, and dysuria. The mean duration of ablation was 22 min (10-35). The mean postoperative hospital stay was 4 days. None of the patients experienced serious complications. Postoperative PSA tests showed the greatest decrease after 3 months to 2.4 ng/mL on average (p < 0.001). The pathological focus seen on MRI before the procedure in each case was absent after 3 months. Control biopsy after 12 months revealed residual cancer in the contralateral lobe in 4 patients. The findings obtained during follow-up and from control biopsies indicate that the treatment was highly efficacious with a low rate of nonserious postoperative complications. HIFU hemiablation proved to be a reliable therapeutic modality for localized PrC and was associated with a low rate of complications and comparable risk of recurrence. Despite the fact that this method of treatment is currently experimental, the results of this case series and other studies indicate its feasibility and safety.""","""['Peter V Glybochko', 'Alexander V Amosov', 'German E Krupinov', 'Nikolay V Petrovskii', 'Ilya S Lumpov']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Oncology""","""['A prospective clinical trial of HIFU hemiablation for clinically localized prostate cancer.', 'Focal High-intensity Focused Ultrasound Targeted Hemiablation for Unilateral Prostate Cancer: A Prospective Evaluation of Oncologic and Functional Outcomes.', 'Comparing High-Intensity Focal Ultrasound Hemiablation to Robotic Radical Prostatectomy in the Management of Unilateral Prostate Cancer: A Matched-Pair Analysis.', 'High-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) for definitive treatment of prostate cancer.', 'Focal Treatment for Unilateral Prostate Cancer Using High-Intensity Focal Ultrasound: A Comprehensive Study of Pooled Data.', 'Focal prostate cancer therapy in the era of multiparametric MRI: a review of options and outcomes.', 'High-Intensity Focused Ultrasound: A Review of Mechanisms and Clinical Applications.']"""

We aimed to identify key factors associated with social distress following PCa.  Methods:   The Life After Prostate Cancer Diagnosis study is a UK national cross-sectional survey of men 18-42 months post diagnosis of PCa. Men (n = 58 930) were invited to participate by their diagnosing cancer centre including 82% of English NHS Trusts (n = 111) and 100% of all Health Boards in Northern Ireland (n = 5), Scotland (n = 14) and Wales (n = 6). Social distress was measured using the Social Difficulties Inventory (SDI-21), 16 item Social Distress scale with men assigned to 'socially distressed'/'not socially distressed' groups, according to published guidelines. Clinical and sociodemographic variables were collected from self-report and cancer registries.  Results:   Response rate 60.8% (n = 35 823) of whom 97% (n = 29 351) completed the Social Distress scale (mean age = 71.2; SD = 7.88). The proportion of 'socially distressed' men was 9.4%.

Recursive partitioning demonstrated that age over 73 and 5 or more positive cores were factors associated with the greatest reclassification risk.  Conclusion:   In our cohort, both advancing age and additional positive cores were associated with increased odds of reclassification to GG2+ on confirmatory biopsy.

Design:   A national population-based descriptive study using Medicare data extracted by the Department of Health (formerly the Department of Health and Ageing).  Setting:   Australia.  Participants:   All men, with a Medicare-reimbursed prostate-specific antigen test conducted in Australia between 2002 and 2017, were included. We focused on ""screening and case finding"" tests (Medicare Benefits Schedule item number 66655) from 1 April 2005 to 31 December 2009, to describe testing differences in subgroups. Groups were categorised into State and Territory, socio-economic status and region of residence. A negative binomial regression model was fitted to measure the incidence rate ratios of those who had a screening prostate-specific antigen test by group.  Main outcome measures:   Age-standardised testing rates and incidence rate ratios.  Results:   Between 2002 and 2017, 11 588 775 screening prostate-specific antigen tests were reimbursed by the Department of Human Services. During 2005-2009, 52% of all Australian men, aged 40 years and over, had a screening test. The incidence rate ratios differed by State and Territory. Men aged 40 years and over, living in very remote areas, were 43% less likely to have had a screening test than residents of major cities. Prostate-specific antigen testing rates fell in all age groups between 2007 and 2009 and 2017.  Conclusions:   The prostate-specific antigen testing behaviour differs between community groups in Australia. Men were less likely to have had a screening prostate-specific antigen test the farther they lived from the major cities.

We have employed D3F3 as a suitable drug carrier that is conjugated with DOX. Since the concentration of zinc ions necessary for triggering gelation falls into the physiological range present in prostate tissue, while other cationic ions fail to trigger at physiological concentrations, the peptide-based drug delivery system (DDS) is injectable and would achieve prostate tissue-specific self-assembly in situ. The D3F3 hydrogels exhibited an optimal gelation time, satisfactory mechanical strength (can be enhanced after incorporation of DOX) as well as excellent thixotropic properties. The DDS reserved some DOX in the prostate 24 h after the injection, making local sustained release possible. In addition, the peptide materials demonstrated no cytotoxicity against normal fibroblast cells and no damage was observed to the prostate tissue of rats. The drug release followed a non-Fickian diffusion model, with no burst release observed. Importantly, the DOX-hydrogel system exhibited good anti-cancer efficacy when incubated with prostate cancer cells DU-145. Therefore, this study lays the groundwork for the future design of tissue-specific DDSs that are triggered by cationic ions (e.g. zinc ions), and the platform could be further developed to incorporate other potent drugs utilized in the field of prostate cancer therapy, thereby increasing their potency and reducing their side effects.""","""['Mingtao Tao', 'Jing Liu', 'Suyun He', 'Keming Xu', 'Wenying Zhong']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Soft Matter""","""['The conjugates of forky peptides and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) self-assemble into supramolecular hydrogels for prostate cancer-specific drug delivery.', 'Zinc-ion-mediated self-assembly of forky peptides for prostate cancer-specific drug delivery.', 'In situ hydrogelation of bicalutamide-peptide conjugates at prostate tissue for smart drug release based on pH and enzymatic activity.', 'Glyoxylic Hydrazone Linkage-Based PEG Hydrogels for Covalent Entrapment and Controlled Delivery of Doxorubicin.', 'Injectable chitosan hydrogels for localised cancer therapy.', 'Recent Developments in Ion-Sensitive Systems for Pharmaceutical Applications.', 'Hydrogels as Drug Delivery Systems: A Review of Current Characterization and Evaluation Techniques.', 'Electrostatic interactions regulate the release of small molecules from supramolecular hydrogels.']"""

Conclusions:   The application of a prostate cancer risk calculator in candidates for first biopsy allows optimization of the test, although it loses effectiveness in patients with previous negative PB.""","""['Jorge Aranda-Lozano', 'Rocío Sierra-Labarta', 'Álvaro de Pablo-Cárdenas', 'Daniel Sánchez-Zalabardo']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Arch Esp Urol""","""['A Preliminary Study of the Ability of the 4Kscore test, the Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial-Risk Calculator and the European Research Screening Prostate-Risk Calculator for Predicting High-Grade Prostate Cancer.', 'Prostate cancer detection rate at repeat saturation biopsy: PCPT risk calculator versus PCA3 score versus case-finding protocol.', 'First prostate biopsy vs rebiopsy: Analysis of our series..', 'Prostate-Specific Antigen-Based Screening for Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Evidence Review for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force Internet.', ""'Prostate Cancer Risk Calculator' mobile applications (Apps): a systematic review and scoring using the validated user version of the Mobile Application Rating Scale (uMARS).""]"""

Recently, there has been a rise in incidence of infections after TRUSp and quinolone-resistant bacteria. The most commonly used prophylaxis is ciprofloxacin (CFLX). Objective: To document the incidence and risk factors of post-TRUSp infections and investigate the microbial resistance patterns for the patients presenting with a serious infection after TRUSp. Materials and methods: Data were collected, including age, comorbidity, previous TRUSp, number of biopsies, previously received antibiotics, time between TRUSp and hospitalization, results of microbiological cultivations, antibiotic prophylaxis, and development of infection for all patients at The University Hospital of Southern Denmark, Esbjerg who underwent TRUSp from November 2014 to November 2016. Results: In total, 590 patients were included and 37 (6.1%) patients were hospitalized with symptoms of infection. Of those 37 patients, 21 (56,8%) patients had positive microbiology (blood and/or urine), 18 (48.6%) patients were infected with E. coli and 11 (29.7%) patients had CFLX-resistant E. coli. If patients had previously received antibiotics, they had a significantly higher risk of developing infection after TRUSp (p = 0.01). Conclusion: Patients who have been exposed to antibiotics before TRUSp are at higher risk of developing serious infections as a complication to TRUSp.

We also aimed to compare Gleason scores, used drugs (LHRH analogs and antiandrogens), PSA levels with SUVmax values, and detection rates.  Method:   This retrospective study included 107 patients who underwent radical prostatectomy and who underwent (68Ga)PSMA I&T PET/CT imaging between January 2015 and December 2018 for the early detection of recurrence. The PSA values, Gleason scores, treatments, lesions detected on (68Ga)PSMA I&T, and SUVmax values were recorded for all patients.  Results:   Patients with a median PSA level of 1.22 ng/mL were divided into seven groups according to the PSA values. The lowest lesion detection rate was found to be 7/16 patients (43.8%) when the PSA was < 0.2 ng/ml, and the highest lesion detection rate was found to be 33/33 patients (100%) when the PSA was > 3.5 ng/ml. There was a positive correlation between PSA level and ppSUVmax (per patient SUVmax) value of the patients with lesions (p < 0.001 and r = 0.49). As the Gleason score increased, the lesion detection rates also increased and there was a significant correlation between these values (p < 0.001 and r = 0.360). A positive correlation was determined between the Gleason scores and ppSUVmax values in patients with lesions (p = 0.007 and r = 0.302). A statistically significant correlation was found between bicalutamide use and lesion detection on (68Ga)PSMA I&T (p < 0.001). A similar relationship was also determined in patients undergoing maximal androgen blockade (MAB) (p = 0.003). Patients determined with lesions on (68Ga)PSMA I&T and who were administered luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonists were found to have statistically significantly higher ppSUVmax values than those who were not administered LHRH agonists (p < 0.001). In binary logistic regression test, when PSA levels and Gleason scores were selected as continuous variables, both PSA levels and Gleason scores were demonstrated as significant covariates (p = 0.006 and p = 0.022) for lesion detection; by contrast, bicalutamide and MAB were not found as significant factors.  Conclusion:   In the present study, (68Ga)PSMA I&T was found to be quite successful in determining lesions in the biochemical recurrence, which is consistent with the findings of other I&T studies and studies conducted with different PSMA ligands.

We showed by noninvasive in vivo immuno-PET/CT imaging that NJB2 detects primary tumors and metastatic sites with excellent specificity in multiple models of breast cancer, including human and mouse triple-negative breast cancer, and in melanoma. We also imaged mice with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) in which NJB2 was able to detect not only PDAC tumors but also early pancreatic lesions called pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasias, which are challenging to detect by any current imaging modalities, with excellent clarity and signal-to-noise ratios that outperformed conventional 2-fluorodeoxyglucose PET/CT imaging. NJB2 also detected pulmonary fibrosis in a bleomycin-induced fibrosis model.

However, if IDH1 and other IDH isoforms are associated with prostate cancer progression, as well as the regulatory factors controlling their expression and activity, remain mostly unknown. Using publicly available datasets, we showed that prostate cancer harbors the highest IDH1 expression across the human cancer spectrum and that IDH1 expression is altered during prostate cancer progression. We showed that the androgen receptor (AR), a key oncogene in prostate cancer, controls multiple IDH isoforms in both in vitro and in vivo models, predominantly positively regulating IDH1. Chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments confirmed the recruitment of AR at several regulatory regions of IDH1 and enzymatic assays demonstrated that AR significantly induces IDH activity. Genetic blockade of IDH1 significantly impaired prostate cancer cell proliferation, consistent with IDH1 having a key function in these cancer cells. Importantly, knockdown of IDH1 blocked the AR-mediated induction in IDH activity, indicating that AR promotes a mitochondrial to cytoplasmic reprogramming of IDH activity. Overall, our study demonstrates that IDH1 expression is associated with prostate cancer progression, that AR signaling integrates one of the first transcriptional mechanisms shown to regulate IDH1, and that AR reprograms prostate cancer cell metabolism by selectively inducing extra-mitochondrial IDH activity. IMPLICATIONS: The discovery that AR reprograms IDH activity highlights a novel metabolic reprogramming necessary for prostate cancer growth and suggests targeting IDH activity as a new therapeutic approach for prostate cancer treatment.""","""['Kevin Gonthier', 'Raghavendra Tejo Karthik Poluri', 'Cindy Weidmann', 'Maude Tadros', 'Étienne Audet-Walsh']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Mol Cancer Res""","""['SREBF1 Activity Is Regulated by an AR/mTOR Nuclear Axis in Prostate Cancer.', 'Isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 sustains a hybrid cytoplasmic-mitochondrial tricarboxylic acid cycle that can be targeted for therapeutic purposes in prostate cancer.', 'Molecular alterations of isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 and 2 (IDH1 and IDH2) metabolic genes and additional genetic mutations in newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia patients.', 'Metabolic consequences of oncogenic IDH mutations.', 'The cancer driver genes IDH1/2, JARID1C/ KDM5C, and UTX/ KDM6A: crosstalk between histone demethylation and hypoxic reprogramming in cancer metabolism.', 'Mitochondrial Alterations in Prostate Cancer: Roles in Pathobiology and Racial Disparities.', 'Preclinical models of prostate cancer - modelling androgen dependency and castration resistance in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo.', 'Metabolic changes during prostate cancer development and progression.', 'Dual contribution of the mTOR pathway and of the metabolism of amino acids in prostate cancer.', 'A FACS-Free Purification Method to Study Estrogen Signaling, Organoid Formation, and Metabolic Reprogramming in Mammary Epithelial Cells.']"""

We also investigated the effect of CIT silencing on epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and Hippo-Yap signaling pathway in the cells using Western blotting.  Results:   CIT expression was significantly elevated in PCa tissues from TCGA cohort (P < 0.05). MSKCC dataset analysis showed that an elevated expression of CIT was significantly correlated with N stage (P=0.001), distant metastasis (P < 0.001), Gleason score (P=0.010) and PSA (P=0.004). In cultured PC-3 cells, knockdown of CIT significantly inhibited cell proliferation, migration and invasion, reversed the EMT phenotype and decreased the expression and activity of YAP.

The intravesical migration of clips is a rare surgical complication of RALP. From March2013 to July 2018, 320 patients underwent RALP at our hospital. Migration of a Hem-o-Lok clip into the urinary bladder occurred in 4 of the 320 patients (1.3%). We analyzed these 4 patients in terms of subjective symptoms, intra- and post-operative findings, site of the migrated clip, and its treatment. The mean duration from RALP to the diagnosis was 13.8 months (2-26 months). The main symptoms due to migrated clips were : narrowed urinary stream, perineal pain, gross hematuria, and painful urination. In all cases, the size of the migrated clip was medium-large, and the events developed on the side contralateral to the first assistant. The clips were transurethrally removed using a Holmium-laser in 2 patients, and spontaneous excretion was observed in 1. The remaining patient has been asymptomatic and is being conservatively observed. In order to prevent the migration of clips used during RALP, the size of the clips and direction of the clip tail may be important. The first assistant should place the clips carefully, especially on the contralateral side.""","""['Yusuke Iemura', 'Yoriaki Kagebayashi', 'Shinji Fukui', 'Yoshiaki Matsumura', 'Yoshihiro Tatsumi', 'Shoji Samma']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Hinyokika Kiyo""","""['Incidental detection of asymptomatic migration of Hem-o-lok clip into the bladder after laparoscopic radical prostatectomy.', 'Bladder neck contractures related to the use of Hem-o-lok clips in robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy.', 'Hem-o-lok clip: a neglected cause of severe bladder neck contracture and consequent urinary incontinence after robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy.', 'Bladder Neck Contracture with Hem-o-Lok Clips Migration after Robotic-Assisted Radical Prostatectomy: A Case Report and Literature Review.', 'Intravesical Hemostatic Clip Migration After Robotic Prostatectomy: Case Series and Review of the Literature.', 'Late-onset Hem-o-Lok® migration into the bladder after robot-assisted radical prostatectomy.']"""

The Bundesverband Prostatakrebs Selbsthilfe e. V. (BPS) operates the largest German-language internet forum for prostate cancer patients.  Materials and methods:   Several aspects of the BPS Forum were examined: content analysis, language use and interaction, influence on treatment decisions, comparison with conventional face-to-face support groups, and use by relatives and friends.  Results:   The online support group is dominated by a tentative style of communication with reserved language features. In addition to the exchange of information, emotional support seems to be very welcome to many users and represents an essential part of the exchange. The use of the internet forum leads to a change in the initial treatment decision in 29 % of patients. In comparison with the general population, rates of patients with anxiety and depression were two to three times as high among the users. Compared with the patients themselves, family members in particular had higher values for anxiety and depression and described a higher rate of metastatic diseases in the patients known to them. Users of the online support group were younger, had a higher educational level and a higher income than participants in conventional face-to-face support groups.  Conclusions:   Online support groups are rated positively by their users and contribute to the acquisition of information and emotional support. They probably have a significant influence on the primary treatment decision and thus actively shape the reality of care for prostate cancer patients.""","""['Johannes Huber', 'Christian Thomas', 'Philipp Karschuck', 'Tanja Muck', 'Philipp Maatz', 'Paul Enders', 'Imad Maatouk', 'Andreas Ihrig']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Aktuelle Urol""","""['Online support groups for localized prostate cancer: qualitative analysis of decision making.', 'Face-to-face vs. online peer support groups for prostate cancer: A cross-sectional comparison study.', 'Online support groups offer low-threshold backing for family and friends of patients with prostate cancer.', 'Self-help and consultation via Internet.

The aim of this study was to investigate the value of mpMRI combined with prostate specific antigen density (PSAD) in the decision making related to the biopsy.  Methods:   mpMRI and mpMRI/transrectal ultrasound fusion targeted biopsies with subsequent systematic biopsies were performed in 397 patients (223 biopsy-naïve and 174 with a previous biopsy). Detection rates of (CSPC) and insignificant PC were stratified using the PIRADS score, and the number of avoidable biopsies and missed (CSPC) were plotted against PSAD values of 0.1-0.5 ng/mL2.  Results:   PIRADS <3 and PSAD <0.2 ng/mL2 were the safest criteria for not performing a biopsy. When applied to the biopsy-naïve group, 21.5% (48/223) of the biopsies could have been avoided and 3.7% (3/82) of CSPC would have been missed.

The rate of total metastatic disease was defined as metastases found either at diagnosis or through progression divided by person-years (PYs) of follow-up for all men in the trial.

Recently, we showed in men that obesity-related periprostatic white adipose tissue (WAT) inflammation, characterized by macrophages surrounding dead or dying adipocytes forming crown-like structures, was associated with high-grade PC. Possibly, interventions that suppress periprostatic WAT inflammation will improve outcomes for men with PC. Here, we tested the hypothesis that supplemental 17β-estradiol (E2) could decrease periprostatic WAT inflammation in obese male mice. Mice were fed a high-fat diet to induce periprostatic WAT inflammation before being treated with supplemental E2. E2 supplementation suppressed caloric intake, induced weight loss, decreased periprostatic WAT inflammation and downregulated the expression of genes linked to inflammation including Cd68, Mcp1 and Tnf. Similar to the effects of E2 supplementation, treatment with diethylstilbestrol, a synthetic estrogen, also suppressed caloric intake and reduced periprostatic WAT inflammation. To determine whether the observed effects of supplemental estrogen could be reproduced by caloric restriction (CR) alone, obese mice were put on a 30% CR diet. Like estrogen treatment, CR was effective in reducing body weight, periprostatic WAT inflammation and the expression of pro-inflammatory genes. Transcriptomic analyses of periprostatic fat showed that obesity was associated with enrichment in inflammatory response pathways, which were normalized by both supplemental E2 and CR. Taken together, these findings strengthen the rationale for future efforts to determine whether either CR or supplemental estrogen will decrease periprostatic WAT inflammation and thereby improve outcomes for men with PC.""","""['Priya Bhardwaj', 'Takahiro Ikeda', 'Xi Kathy Zhou', 'Hanhan Wang', 'Xi Emily Zheng', 'Dilip D Giri', 'Olivier Elemento', 'Akanksha Verma', 'Miki Miyazawa', 'Sushmita Mukherjee', 'Domenick J Falcone', 'Nils K Wendel', 'Douglas S Scherr', 'Andrew J Dannenberg']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Carcinogenesis""","""['Pioglitazone Inhibits Periprostatic White Adipose Tissue Inflammation in Obese Mice.', 'Periprostatic adipose inflammation is associated with high-grade prostate cancer.', 'Estrogen Protects against Obesity-Induced Mammary Gland Inflammation in Mice.', 'The ""Big Bang"" in obese fat: Events initiating obesity-induced adipose tissue inflammation.', 'Recent advances in the relationship between obesity, inflammation, and insulin resistance.', 'Periprostatic adipose tissue (PPAT) supernatant from obese mice releases anticontractile substances and increases human prostate epithelial cell proliferation: the role of nitric oxide and adenosine.', 'Mechanisms of obesity- and diabetes mellitus-related pancreatic carcinogenesis: a comprehensive and systematic review.', 'Thromboinflammatory Processes at the Nexus of Metabolic Dysfunction and Prostate Cancer: The Emerging Role of Periprostatic Adipose Tissue.', 'The Role of Persistent Organic Pollutants in Obesity: A Review of Laboratory and Epidemiological Studies.', 'S100A8 expression in oviduct mucosal epithelial cells is regulated by estrogen and affects mucosal immune homeostasis.']"""

Here we show that Wnt signal activation in mammalian cells activates intracellular mobilization of connexin 43 (Cx43), which belongs to a gap junction protein family, a new target protein in response to extracellular Wnt signal activation. Transmission electron microscopy showed that the nuclear localization of Cx43 was increased by 8- to 10-fold in Wnt5A- and 9B-treated cells compared with controls; this Wnt-induced increase was negated in the cells where Cx43 and β-catenin were knocked down using shRNA. There was a significant (P < 0.001) and concomitant depletion of the cell membrane and cytosolic signal of Cx43 in Wnt-treated cells with an increase in the nuclear signal for Cx43; this was more obvious in cells where β-catenin was knocked down using shRNA. Conversely, Cx43 knockdown resulted in increased β-catenin in the nucleus in the absence of Wnt activation. Coimmunoprecipitation of Cx43 and β-catenin proteins with a casein kinase (CKIδ) antibody showed that Cx43 interacts with β-catenin and may form part of the so-called destruction complex.

Recent research suggests that US cancer mortality can still be lowered considerably by applying known interventions broadly and equitably. The ACS Board of Directors, therefore, commissioned ACS researchers to determine challenge goals for reductions in cancer mortality by 2035. A statistical model was used to estimate the average annual percent decline in overall cancer death rates among the US general population and among college-educated Americans during the most recent period. Then, the average annual percent decline in the overall cancer death rates of college graduates was applied to the death rates in the general population to project future rates in the United States beginning in 2020. If overall cancer death rates from 2020 through 2035 nationally decline at the pace of those of college graduates, then death rates in 2035 in the United States will drop by 38.3% from the 2015 level and by 54.4% from the 1990 level. On the basis of these results, the ACS 2035 challenge goal was set as a 40% reduction from the 2015 level. Achieving this goal could lead to approximately 1.3 million fewer cancer deaths than would have occurred from 2020 through 2035 and 122,500 fewer cancer deaths in 2035 alone. The results also show that reducing the prevalence of risk factors and achieving optimal adherence to evidence-based screening guidelines by 2025 could lead to a 33.5% reduction in the overall cancer death rate by 2035, attaining 85% of the challenge goal.""","""['Jiemin Ma', 'Ahmedin Jemal', 'Stacey A Fedewa', 'Farhad Islami', 'J Leonard Lichtenfeld', 'Richard C Wender', 'Kevin J Cullen', 'Otis W Brawley']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""CA Cancer J Clin""","""['The American Cancer Society challenge goal to reduce US cancer mortality by 50% between 1990 and 2015: Results and reflections.', 'The American Cancer Society challenge goals.

Nevertheless, in spite of its frequent upregulation in cancer, the mechanism(s) underlying its expression are largely unknown. Herein, bioinformatics analyses identified the promoter region of the Sam68 gene (KHDRBS1) and the proto-oncogenic transcription factor c-MYC as a key regulator of Sam68 expression. Upregulation of Sam68 and c-MYC correlate in PCa patients. c-MYC directly binds to and activates the Sam68 promoter. Furthermore, c-MYC affects productive splicing of the nascent Sam68 transcript by modulating the transcriptional elongation rate within the gene. Importantly, c-MYC-dependent expression of Sam68 is under the tight control of external cues, such as androgens and/or mitogens. These findings uncover an unexpected coordination of transcription and splicing of Sam68 by c-MYC, which may represent a key step in PCa tumorigenesis.""","""['Cinzia Caggiano', 'Marco Pieraccioli', 'Valentina Panzeri', 'Claudio Sette', 'Pamela Bielli']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Nucleic Acids Res""","""['The transcriptional co-activator SND1 is a novel regulator of alternative splicing in prostate cancer cells.', 'Alternative splicing of the cyclin D1 proto-oncogene is regulated by the RNA-binding protein Sam68.', 'SAM68 promotes tumorigenesis in lung adenocarcinoma by regulating metabolic conversion via PKM alternative splicing.', 'The RNA-binding protein Sam68 is a multifunctional player in human cancer.', 'RNA splicing and splicing regulator changes in prostate cancer pathology.', 'The RNA-binding proteins hnRNP H and F regulate splicing of a MYC-dependent HRAS exon in prostate cancer cells.', 'Identification of ZDHHC1 as a Pyroptosis Inducer and Potential Target in the Establishment of Pyroptosis-Related Signature in Localized Prostate Cancer.', 'Prognostic value of PNN in prostate cancer and its correlation with therapeutic significance.', 'The transcriptional terminator XRN2 and the RNA-binding protein Sam68 link alternative polyadenylation to cell cycle progression in prostate cancer.', ""The androgen receptor couples promoter recruitment of RNA processing factors to regulation of alternative polyadenylation at the 3' end of transcripts.""]"""

Prostate cancer is among the types of cancer with high mortality in men. There are a few numbers of studies investigating the effects of boric acid on prostate cancer cells. The objective of the present study was to assess the effects of boric acid at concentrations higher than that can be achieved in blood by dietary intake on DU-145 human prostate cancer cells for 24 h. Firstly, we determined the cytotoxic activity of boric acid (0 to 12.5 mM) on DU-145 human prostate cancer cells by using 3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol, 2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) and defined the IC50 concentration of boric acid. Then, by employing the doses found in MTT, the levels of antioxidant-oxidant molecules and apoptotic proteins were measured and morphological changes were evaluated. We have concluded that boric acid caused oxidative stress, inhibition of cell growth, apoptosis, and morphological alterations in a concentration-dependent manner in DU-145 cells. Furthermore, treatments with increasing boric acid concentrations decreased the antioxidant levels in cells. We actually revealed that boric acid, known as an antioxidant, may prevent cell proliferation by acting as an oxidant in certain doses. Although the high IC50 concentration of boric acid is perceived to be negative, we think it provides important background for subsequent studies.""","""['Ceyhan Hacioglu', 'Fatih Kar', 'Sedat Kacar', 'Varol Sahinturk', 'Gungor Kanbak']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Biol Trace Elem Res""","""['Betaine suppresses cell proliferation by increasing oxidative stress-mediated apoptosis and inflammation in DU-145 human prostate cancer cell line.', 'Concentration-Dependent Effects of Zinc Sulfate on DU-145 Human Prostate Cancer Cell Line: Oxidative, Apoptotic, Inflammatory, and Morphological Analyzes.', 'Boric acid inhibits human prostate cancer cell proliferation.', 'Polymers Based on Phenyl Boric Acid in Tumor-Targeted Therapy.', 'Boric Acid, a Lewis Acid With Unique and Unusual Properties: Formulation Implications.', 'Organoboronic acids/esters as effective drug and prodrug candidates in cancer treatments: challenge and hope.', 'Toll-like receptors and nuclear factor kappa B signaling pathway involvement in hepatorenal oxidative damage induced by some food preservatives in rats.', 'Nonylphenol Exposure-Induced Oocyte Quality Deterioration Could be Reversed by Boric Acid Supplementation in Rats.', 'Identification of SLITRK6 as a Novel Biomarker in hepatocellular carcinoma by comprehensive bioinformatic analysis.', 'Borax Pentahydrate and Disodium Pentaborate Decahydrate Are Candidates as Anti-leukemic Drug Components by Inducing Apoptosis and Changing Bax/Bcl-2 Ratio in HL-60 Cell Line.']"""

Study objectives were to determine whether receiving an information booklet about PCa treatment options prior to receiving biopsy results was acceptable to patients, and if receiving this information influenced levels of anxiety, depression, distress, and treatment decisional conflict.  Methods:   Between June 2016 and September 2017, a randomised block design was used to allocate patients from an Australian urology practice into the intervention or control group. Patients in the intervention group were provided with written information about treatment options for localised PCa prior to their biopsy. Outcome measures including the Distress Thermometer, Generalised Anxiety Disorder-7, Patient Health Questionnaire-9, and Decisional Conflict Scale were completed pre-biopsy and 2-3 weeks post-biopsy. Ninety-eight patients referred for an initial prostate biopsy for an elevated PSA test or suspicious digital rectal exam participated in the study (response rate = 78%).  Results:   Multimodal repeated-measures analyses showed no significant differences between control and intervention groups in changes in distress, anxiety, or depression from pre- to post-biopsy, and in decisional conflict post-diagnosis (all p > .05). Thirty-five (87%) patients believed that the resource made it easier to understand subsequent explanation of treatment options, and 51 patients (98%) who received the intervention preferred to be given information at that time.  Conclusions:   Providing patients with information about treatment options prior to biopsy did not impact on changes in psychological distress and decisional conflict post-biopsy.

We assessed hazard ratios (HRs) of incident acute myocardial infarction (MI), ischaemic stroke (IS) and heart failure (HF) among 1546 men diagnosed with PCa treated with first-line active surveillance, watchful waiting, intended curative or palliative treatment compared with PCa-free men during 18 years of follow-up.  Results:   Men who received first-line palliative treatment had higher rates of IS and HF with adjusted HRs of 2.09 (95% CI 1.49-2.93) and 2.05 (95% CI 1.43-2.94), respectively, compared with PCa-free men. The risks were increased from start of treatment. We did not find the same relation for men in any other treatment group. No differences between men treated for PCa and cancer-free controls were observed for MI after adjustment for lifestyle, anthropometry, and cardiovascular risk factors.

Transcript expression of the high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol receptor scavenger receptor B1 (SR-B1) is elevated in primary prostate cancer. Hypothesizing that SR-B1 expression may help facilitate malignant transformation, we document increased SR-B1 protein and transcript expression in prostate cancer relative to normal prostate epithelium that persists in lethal castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) metastasis. As intratumoral steroid synthesis from the precursor cholesterol can drive androgen receptor (AR) pathway activity in CRPC, we screened androgenic benign and cancer cell lines for sensitivity to SR-B1 antagonism. Benign cells were insensitive to SR-B1 antagonism, and cancer line sensitivity inversely correlated with expression levels of full-length and splice variant AR. In androgen-responsive CRPC cell model C4-2, SR-B1 antagonism suppressed cholesterol uptake, de novo steroidogenesis, and AR activity. SR-B1 antagonism also suppressed growth and viability and induced endoplasmic reticulum stress and autophagy. The inability of exogenous steroids to reverse these effects indicates that AR pathway activation is insufficient to overcome cytotoxic stress caused by a decrease in the availability of cholesterol. Furthermore, SR-B1 antagonism decreased cholesterol uptake, growth, and viability of the AR-null CRPC cell model PC-3, and the small-molecule SR-B1 antagonist block lipid transport-1 decreased xenograft growth rate despite poor pharmacologic properties. Overall, our findings show that SR-B1 is upregulated in primary and castration-resistant disease and is essential for cholesterol uptake needed to drive both steroidogenic and nonsteroidogenic biogenic pathways, thus implicating SR-B1 as a novel and potentially actionable target in CRPC. SIGNIFICANCE: These findings highlight SR-B1 as a potential target in primary and castration-resistant prostate cancer that is essential for cholesterol uptake needed to drive steroidogenic and nonsteroidogenic biogenic pathways.""","""['Jacob A Gordon', 'Jake W Noble', 'Ankur Midha', 'Fatemeh Derakhshan', 'Gang Wang', 'Hans H Adomat', 'Emma S Tomlinson Guns', 'Yen-Yi Lin', 'Shancheng Ren', 'Collin C Collins', 'Peter S Nelson', 'Colm Morrissey', 'Kishor M Wasan', 'Michael E Cox']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Cancer Res""","""['Reactivation of androgen receptor-regulated lipid biosynthesis drives the progression of castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Alterations in cholesterol regulation contribute to the production of intratumoral androgens during progression to castration-resistant prostate cancer in a mouse xenograft model.', 'Osteoblasts promote castration-resistant prostate cancer by altering intratumoral steroidogenesis.', 'Androgen receptor-dependent and -independent mechanisms driving prostate cancer progression: Opportunities for therapeutic targeting from multiple angles.', 'Androgen receptors in hormone-dependent and castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'New insights into lipid metabolism and prostate cancer (Review).', 'Integrated Whole-Exome and Transcriptome Sequencing Indicated Dysregulation of Cholesterol Metabolism in Eyelid Sebaceous Gland Carcinoma.', 'HDL Functions-Current Status and Future Perspectives.', 'Molecular Characterization of Cancer Associated Fibroblasts in Prostate Cancer.', 'Rhenium(I) conjugates as tools for tracking cholesterol in cells.']"""

Mechanistically, PGC1α inhibits the expression of c-MYC and ornithine decarboxylase 1 (ODC1), the rate-limiting enzyme for polyamine synthesis. Analysis of in vivo metastases and clinical data from patients with prostate cancer support the proposition that the PGC1α/c-MYC/ODC1 axis regulates polyamine biosynthesis and prostate cancer aggressiveness.

Methods and materials:   Digital autoradiographs of QA seed orders and sterile preloaded needles were acquired. Regions of interest of each preloaded seed were determined through an iterative scanning process identifying changes from background levels to radioactivity exposure. Average exposure values through the center of each region of interest were fitted with a Gaussian curve and Full Width at Half Maximums (FWHMs) were calculated. The two-dimensional exposure-scaled FWHM (Exp2D) measurements for the QA seed orders were plotted against measured AKS values and related using a linear curve fit that was adjusted using the third-party assay average AKS and applied as a calibration curve to convert Exp2D to AKS.  Results:   Estimated seed AKS was found to have a strong dependence on position within the holding tray because of imager positioning inconsistencies. Calculated seed AKS for patient-specific seed orders using the curve scaling factor varied from the nominal order AKS by 1.1 ± 0.9% and from the third-party assay measurements by 0.0 ± 0.4%.

This disease is characterized by uncontrolled growth and proliferation of abnormal cells with a high probability to develop metastasis. Recently, it was demonstrated that perezone, a sesquiterpene quinone, is capable to induce cell death in leukemia (K562), prostate (PC-3), colorectal (HCT-15) and lung (SKLU-1) cancer cell lines; however, its mechanism of action is unknown. Therefore, in this study, in vitro and computational studies were performed to determine the mechanism of action of perezone. Firstly, changes in K562 cell viability, as well as changes in the redox status of the cell in response to treatment with several concentrations of perezone were analyzed. The type of cell death induced, and the modification of the cell cycle were determined. In addition, MD simulations and docking studies were performed to investigate the interaction of perezone with seven regulators of the apoptotic process. Finally, the ability of perezone to inhibit PARP-1 was evaluated by in vitro studies. K562 cells treated with perezone exhibited decreased viability and more oxidized status, being this effect concentration-dependent. In addition, the increase of G0/G1 phase of cell cycle and apoptosis were observed. According to the performed computational studies conducted, perezone showed the highest affinity to PARP-1 enzyme being this complex the most stable due to the presence of a small and deep cavity in the active site, which allows perezone to fit deeply by forming hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions, which drive this interaction. The activity of perezone as PARP-1 inhibitor was corroborated with an IC50 = 181.5 μM. The pro-apoptotic action of perezone may be related to PARP-1 inhibition and changes in the redox state of the cell. The obtained results allowed to understand the biological effect of perezone and, consequently, these could be employed to develop novel PARP-1 inhibitors.""","""['Maricarmen Hernández-Rodríguez', 'Pablo I Mendoza Sánchez', 'Martha Edith Macias Perez', 'Erika Rosales Cruz', 'Elvia Mera Jiménez', 'María Inés Nicolás Vázquez', 'René Miranda Ruvalcaba']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Arch Biochem Biophys""","""['In Vitro and Computational Studies of Perezone and Perezone Angelate as Potential Anti-Glioblastoma Multiforme Agents.', 'In\xa0vitro and computational studies of natural products related to perezone as anti-neoplastic agents.', 'Development of novel synthesized phthalazinone-based PARP-1 inhibitors with apoptosis inducing mechanism in lung cancer.', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerase (PARP) and PARP Inhibitors: Mechanisms of Action and Role in Cardiovascular Disorders.', 'An Update on Poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase-1 (PARP-1) Inhibitors: Opportunities and Challenges in Cancer Therapy.', 'In Vitro and Computational Studies of Perezone and Perezone Angelate as Potential Anti-Glioblastoma Multiforme Agents.', 'A Timeline of Perezone, the First Isolated Secondary Metabolite in the New World, Covering the Period from 1852 to 2020.']"""

We applied the CPG model to a UK and a Swedish prostate cancer cohort to test differences in prostate cancer mortality (PCM) in men managed conservatively or by upfront treatment in CPG2 and 3 (which subdivides the intermediate-risk classification) vs CPG1 (low-risk). We then applied the CPG model to a contemporary UK AS cohort, which was optimally characterised at baseline for disease burden, to identify predictors of true prognostic progression. Results were re-tested in an external AS cohort from Spain.  Results:   In a UK cohort (n = 3659) the 10-year PCM was 2.3% in CPG1, 1.5%/3.5% in treated/untreated CPG2, and 1.9%/8.6% in treated/untreated CPG3. In the Swedish cohort (n = 27 942) the10-year PCM was 1.0% in CPG1, 2.2%/2.7% in treated/untreated CPG2, and 6.1%/12.5% in treated/untreated CPG3. We then tested using progression to CPG3 as a hard endpoint in a modern AS cohort (n = 133). During follow-up (median 3.5 years) only 6% (eight of 133) progressed to CPG3. Predictors of progression were a PSA density ≥0.15 ng/mL/mL and CPG2 at diagnosis. Progression occurred in 1%, 8% and 21% of men with neither factor, only one, or both, respectively.

However, there is a need to apply radiomics to the preoperative prediction of extracapsular extension (ECE).  Purpose:   To develop and validate a radiomics signature to preoperatively predict the probability of ECE for patients with PCa, compared with the radiologists' interpretations.  Study type:   Retrospective.  Population:   In total, 210 patients with pathology-confirmed ECE status (101 positive, 109 negative) were enrolled.  Field strength/sequence:   T2 -weighted imaging (T2 WI), diffusion-weighted imaging, and dynamic contrast-enhanced imaging were performed on two 3.0T MR scanners.  Assessment:   A radiomics signature was constructed to predict the probability of ECE prior to radical prostatectomy (RP). In all, 17 stable radiomics features of 1619 extracted features based on T2 WI were selected. The same images were also evaluated by three radiologists. The predictive performance of the radiomics signature was validated and compared with radiologists' interpretations.  Statistical tests:   A radiomics signature was developed by a least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression algorithm. Samples enrolled were randomly divided into two groups (143 for training and 67 for validation). Discrimination, calibration, and clinical usefulness were validated by analysis of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, calibration curve, and the decision curve, respectively. The predictive performance was then compared with visual assessments of three radiologists.  Results:   The radiomics signature yielded an AUC of 0.902 and 0.883 in the training and validation cohort, respectively, and outperformed the visual assessment (AUC: 0.600-0.697) in the validation cohort. Pairwise comparisons demonstrated that the radiomics signature was more sensitive than the radiologists (75.00% vs. 46.88%-50.00%, all P < 0.05), but obtained comparable specificities (91.43% vs. (88.57%-94.29%); P ranged from 0.64-1.00).  Data conclusion:   A radiomics signature was developed and validated that outperformed the radiologists' visual assessments in predicting ECE status.

LUTS and urinary retention are common in men with prostate cancer (PCa). The purpose of this study was to estimate the efficacy and safety of palliative PAE on LUTS or urinary retention in men with advanced PCa.  Materials and methods:   This prospective, single-center trial was conducted from March 2017 to November 2018. The trial protocol was registered online (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03104907). Only men with advanced PCa suffering from LUTS or urinary retention were included. The primary outcome was the ability to void without a catheter and International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) in non-catheter-dependent patients. The paired t test was used to analyze changes from baseline with 95% confidence intervals (CI). A p value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.  Results:   Seventeen patients were assessed for eligibility, and 15 patients with a mean age of 73.8 years were enrolled. Four men did not complete follow-up: cancer-related death (n = 2), lost to follow-up (n = 1), and unsuccessful embolization due to severe atherosclerosis (n = 1). Bilateral embolization was achieved in ten cases, and urinary retention resolved in one of six patients. LUTS improved in the remaining (n = 5) patients by a mean 12.2-point reduction in IPSS (95% CI - 23.53; - 0.87). According to the CIRSE classification, two grade 1 and two grade 3 complications occurred.

We characterized H4K12 recognition by solving the crystal structure of human C21orf127-TRMT112, hereafter termed 'lysine methyltransferase 9' (KMT9), in complex with S-adenosyl-homocysteine and H4K12me1 peptide. Additional analyses revealed enrichment for KMT9 and H4K12me1 at the promoters of numerous genes encoding cell cycle regulators and control of cell cycle progression by KMT9. Importantly, KMT9 depletion severely affects the proliferation of androgen receptor-dependent, as well as that of castration- and enzalutamide-resistant prostate cancer cells and xenograft tumors. Our data link H4K12 methylation with KMT9-dependent regulation of androgen-independent prostate tumor cell proliferation, thereby providing a promising paradigm for the treatment of castration-resistant prostate cancer.""","""['Eric Metzger', 'Sheng Wang', 'Sylvia Urban', 'Dominica Willmann', 'Andreas Schmidt', 'Anne Offermann', 'Anita Allen', 'Manuela Sum', 'Nadine Obier', 'Félicie Cottard', 'Svenja Ulferts', 'Bogdan-Tiberius Preca', 'Bianca Hermann', 'Jochen Maurer', 'Holger Greschik', 'Veit Hornung', 'Oliver Einsle', 'Sven Perner', 'Axel Imhof', 'Manfred Jung', 'Roland Schüle']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Nat Struct Mol Biol""","""['KMT9 Controls Stemness and Growth of Colorectal Cancer.', 'The Common Partner of Several Methyltransferases TRMT112 Regulates the Expression of N6AMT1 Isoforms in Mammalian Cells.', 'Structural insight into HEMK2-TRMT112-mediated glutamine methylation.', 'Alterations in histone H4 lysine 20 methylation: implications for cancer detection and prevention.', 'Protein lysine methylation by seven-β-strand methyltransferases.', 'Human seven-β-strand (METTL) methyltransferases\xa0-\xa0conquering the universe of protein lysine methylation.', 'H4-methylation regulators mediated epitranscriptome patterns and tumor microenvironment infiltration characterization in hepatocellular carcinoma.', 'Overexpression of KMT9α Is Associated with Aggressive Basal-like Muscle-Invasive Bladder Cancer.', 'Transcriptome profiling of histone writers/erasers enzymes across spermatogenesis, mature sperm and pre-cleavage embryo: Implications in paternal epigenome transitions and inheritance mechanisms.', 'Experimental in vitro, ex\xa0vivo and in vivo models in prostate cancer research.']"""

The histopathological examination of post-surgical prostate specimens and manual annotation of PCa not only allow for detailed assessment of disease characteristics and extent, but also supply the ground truth for developing of computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems for PCa detection before definitive treatment. As manual cancer annotation is tedious and subjective, there have been a number of publications describing methods for automating the procedure via the analysis of digitized whole-slide images (WSIs). However, these studies have focused only on the analysis of WSIs stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E), even though there is additional information that could be obtained from immunohistochemical (IHC) staining. In this work, we propose a framework for automating the annotation of PCa that is based on automated colorimetric analysis of both H&E and IHC WSIs stained with a triple-antibody cocktail against high-molecular weight cytokeratin (HMWCK), p63, and α-methylacyl CoA racemase (AMACR). The analysis outputs were then used to train a regression model to estimate the distribution of cancerous epithelium within slides. The approach yielded an AUC of 0.951, sensitivity of 87.1%, and specificity of 90.7% as compared to slide-level annotations, and generalized well to cancers of all grades.""","""['Ethan Leng', 'Jonathan C Henriksen', 'Anthony E Rizzardi', 'Jin Jin', 'Jung Who Nam', 'Benjamin M Brassuer', 'Andrew D Johnson', 'Nicholas P Reder', 'Joseph S Koopmeiners', 'Stephen C Schmechel', 'Gregory J Metzger']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Sci Rep""","""['Virtual microscopy in prostate histopathology: simultaneous viewing of biopsies stained sequentially with hematoxylin and eosin, and alpha-methylacyl-coenzyme A racemase/p63 immunohistochemistry.', 'Immunohistochemical antibody cocktail staining (p63/HMWCK/AMACR) of ductal adenocarcinoma and Gleason pattern 4 cribriform and noncribriform acinar adenocarcinomas of the prostate.', 'Alpha-methylacyl-CoA racemase: a variably sensitive immunohistochemical marker for the diagnosis of small prostate cancer foci on needle biopsy.', 'Immunohistochemical pitfalls in prostate pathology.', 'Application of alpha-methylacyl coenzyme A racemase immunohistochemistry in the diagnosis of prostate cancer: a review.', 'Radiomics-Based Machine Learning Models for Predicting P504s/P63 Immunohistochemical Expression: A Noninvasive Diagnostic Tool for Prostate Cancer.']"""

Thus, we investigated the role of IL-7 in tumor invasiveness using metastatic prostate cancer PC-3 cell line derivatives, and assessed the potential of IL-7 as a clinical target using a Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor and an IL-7-blocking antibody. We found that IL-7 stimulated wound-healing migration and invasion of PC-3 cells, increased phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 5, Akt, and extracellular signal-regulated kinase. On the other hand, a JAK inhibitor and an IL-7-blocking antibody decreased the invasiveness of PC-3 cells. IL-7 increased tumor sphere formation and expression of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers. Importantly, lentiviral delivery of IL-7Rα to PC-3 cells significantly increased bone metastasis in an experimental murine metastasis model compared to controls. The gene expression profile of human prostate cancer cells from The Cancer Genome Atlas revealed that EMT pathways are strongly associated with prostate cancers that highly express both IL-7 and IL-7Rα.

Resolving intercellular signaling pathways between CAF and prostate tumor epithelium may offer novel opportunities for research translation. To this end, the proteome and phosphoproteome of four pairs of patient-matched CAF and NPF were characterized to identify discriminating proteomic signatures. Samples were analyzed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) with a hyper reaction monitoring data-independent acquisition (HRM-DIA) workflow. Proteins that exhibited a significant increase in CAF versus NPF were enriched for the functional categories ""cell adhesion"" and the ""extracellular matrix."" The CAF phosphoproteome exhibited enhanced phosphorylation of proteins associated with the ""spliceosome"" and ""actin binding."" STRING analysis of the CAF proteome revealed a prominent interaction hub associated with collagen synthesis, modification, and signaling. It contained multiple collagens, including the fibrillar types COL1A1/2 and COL5A1; the receptor tyrosine kinase discoidin domain-containing receptor 2 (DDR2), a receptor for fibrillar collagens; and lysyl oxidase-like 2 (LOXL2), an enzyme that promotes collagen crosslinking. Increased activity and/or expression of LOXL2 and DDR2 in CAF were confirmed by enzymatic assays and Western blotting analyses. Pharmacological inhibition of CAF-derived LOXL2 perturbed extracellular matrix (ECM) organization and decreased CAF migration in a wound healing assay. Further, it significantly impaired the motility of co-cultured RWPE-2 prostate tumor epithelial cells. These results indicate that CAF-derived LOXL2 is an important mediator of intercellular communication within the prostate tumor microenvironment and is a potential therapeutic target.""","""['Elizabeth V Nguyen', 'Brooke A Pereira', 'Mitchell G Lawrence', 'Xiuquan Ma', 'Richard J Rebello', 'Howard Chan', 'Birunthi Niranjan', 'Yunjian Wu', 'Stuart Ellem', 'Xiaoqing Guan', 'Jianmin Wu', 'Joanna N Skhinas', 'Thomas R Cox', 'Gail P Risbridger', 'Renea A Taylor', 'Natalie L Lister', 'Roger J Daly']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Mol Cell Proteomics""","""['Interaction between prostate cancer cells and prostate fibroblasts promotes accumulation and proteolytic processing of basement membrane proteins.', 'Novel mechanism for OSM-promoted extracellular matrix remodeling in breast cancer: LOXL2 upregulation and subsequent ECM alignment.', 'Tumor-secreted LOXL2 activates fibroblasts through FAK signaling.', 'LOXL2 in cancer: regulation, downstream effectors and novel roles.', 'Role of miRNAs in cell signaling of cancer associated fibroblasts.', 'Cancer-associated fibroblasts: from basic science to anticancer therapy.', 'The Interplay between T Cells and Cancer: The Basis of Immunotherapy.', 'The Extracellular Matrix: Its Composition, Function, Remodeling, and Role in Tumorigenesis.', 'Identification of the novel therapeutic targets and biomarkers associated of prostate cancer with cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs).', 'Extracellular matrix remodeling in tumor progression and immune escape: from mechanisms to treatments.']"""

This study estimates the association between limiting care due to cost and HRQOL in a diverse population of cancer survivors and tests whether limiting care mediates the association between financial hardship and HRQOL.  Methods:   We used data from 988 participants (579 African American, 409 white) in the Detroit Research on Cancer Survivors (ROCS) pilot, a hospital-based cohort of breast, colorectal, lung, and prostate cancer survivors. We assessed associations between financial hardship, limiting care, and HRQOL [measured by the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General (FACT-G)] using linear regression and mediation analysis controlling for demographic, socioeconomic, and cancer-related variables.  Results:   FACT-G scores were 4.2 [95% confidence interval (CI), 2.0-6.4] points lower among survivors who reported financial hardship compared with those who did not in adjusted models. Limiting care due to cost was associated with a -7.8 (95% CI, -5.1 to -10.5) point difference in FACT-G scores. Limiting care due to cost explained 40.5% (95% CI, 25.5%-92.7%) of the association between financial hardship and HRQOL overall, and 50.5% (95% CI, 29.1%-188.1%) of the association for African American survivors.  Conclusions:   Financial hardship and limiting care due to cost are both associated with lower HRQOL among diverse cancer survivors, and this association is partially explained by limiting care due to cost.

Prostatectomy is the most common treatment. Morbidity from prostatectomy is high-80% of men experience urinary incontinence which negatively impacts the quality of life. Postsurgical pelvic floor muscle training is commonly prescribed but recent systematic reviews found no evidence of efficacy. We propose a new treatment that commences preoperatively and targets functional training of specific pelvic floor muscles that contribute to urinary continence. Assessment and biofeedback using transperineal ultrasound imaging assists in training. This will be compared against conventional training (maximal pelvic floor muscle contraction assessed by digital rectal examination) and no training. Embedded physiological studies will allow the investigation of moderation and mediation of the treatment effect on the outcomes.  Methods and analysis:   This randomised clinical trial will include 363 men scheduled to undergo radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer. Participants will be randomised into urethral training, conventional training and no training groups. Clinical data will be collected at baseline (1-2 weeks presurgery) and postsurgery after catheter removal, weekly to 3 months (primary endpoint) and monthly to 12 months. Outcomes include 24-hour pad weight test (primary), incontinence, quality of life and cost-effectiveness data. Neuromuscular control measures of pelvic floor muscles will be measured at baseline, postsurgery, 6 weeks, 3 and 12 months. Study assessors and statisticians will be blinded to the group allocation.

Design, setting, and participants:   A cross-sectional postal survey of prostate cancer survivors diagnosed 18-42mo previously.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Urinary, bowel, and sexual problems and vitality were patient reported using the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC-26) questionnaire. General health was also self-assessed. Regional variations were identified using multivariable log-linear regression.  Results and limitations:   A total of 35823 men responded, 60.8% of those invited. Self-assessed health was significantly lower than the UK average in Wales and Scotland. Respondents reported more urinary incontinence in Scotland, more urinary irritation/obstruction in Scotland and Northern Ireland (NI), poorer bowel function in Scotland and NI, worse sexual function in Scotland, and reduced vitality/hormonal function in Scotland, Wales, and NI. Self-assessed health was poorer than the English average in South Yorkshire and North-East and Cumbria, with more urinary incontinence in North-East and Cumbria and Peninsula, greater sexual problems in West Midlands, and poorer vitality in North-East and Cumbria and West Midlands. Limitations include difficulty identifying clinically significant differences and limited information on pretreatment conditions.  Conclusions:   Despite adjustment for treatment, and clinical and sociodemographic factors, quality of survival among prostate cancer survivors varied by area of residence. Adoption of best practice from areas performing well could support enhanced survival quality in poorer performing areas, particularly with regard to bowel problems and vitality, where clinically relevant differences were reported.

The aim of our study is to identify the possible predictive factors of AWS at diagnosis.  Materials and methods:   We performed a retrospective study of 70 patients treated with AA at the Institut Català d'Oncologia - L'Hospitalet between 2015 and 2017.  Results:   11 patients presented AWS. The mean age at diagnosis was 65.73 years and the mean age of presentation was 74.18 years. Patients were in the ninth treatment cycle. The median PSA was: 30.5ng/ml at diagnosis, 33.24ng/ml in the AWS, and 15.78ng/ml before starting another treatment. The median follow-up period after AWS was 8.2 months. The predictive factors of AWS would be: high PSA (p=.002), ISUP≥4 (p=.002) and stage IV at diagnosis (p<.001). Patients with a T stage present high risk, but without statistical significance. An AUC of 0.84 was obtained, with a 95% CI between 0.77 and 0.92 (p<.001).  Conclusions:   The incidence of AWS is not negligible, describing prolonged responses after AA withdrawal, including the possibility of increased overall survival.

To date, two DNMT inhibitors (DNMTi), 5-azacytidine (5-AZA) and 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (DAC), are approved for the treatment of myelodysplastic syndromes and acute myeloid leukemia. Nevertheless, they are chemically instable and quite toxic for healthy cells; thus, the discovery of novel DNMTi is urgent.  Results:   Here, we report the identification of a new quinoline-based molecule, MC3353, as a non-nucleoside inhibitor and downregulator of DNMT. This compound was able, in promoter demethylating assays, to induce enhanced green fluorescence protein (EGFP) gene expression in HCT116 cells and transcription in a cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter-driven luciferase reporter system in KG-1 cells. Moreover, MC3353 displayed a strong antiproliferative activity when tested on HCT116 colon cancer cells after 48 h of treatment at 0.5 μM. At higher doses, this compound provided a cytotoxic effect in double DNMT knockout HCT116 cells. MC3353 was also screened on a different panel of cancer cells (KG-1 and U-937 acute myeloid leukemia, RAJI Burkitt's lymphoma, PC-3 prostate cancer, and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer), where it arrested cell proliferation and reduced viability after 48 h of treatment with IC50 values ranging from 0.3 to 0.9 μM. Compared to healthy cell models, MC3353 induced apoptosis (e.g., U-937 and KG-1 cells) or necrosis (e.g., RAJI cells) at lower concentrations. Importantly, together with the main DNMT3A enzyme inhibition, MC3353 was also able to downregulate the DNMT3A protein level in selected HCT116 and PC-3 cell lines. Additionally, this compound provided impairment of the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) by inducing E-cadherin while reducing matrix metalloproteinase (MMP2) mRNA and protein levels in PC-3 and HCT116 cells. Last, tested on a panel of primary osteosarcoma cell lines, MC3353 markedly inhibited cell growth with low single-digit micromolar IC50 ranging from 1.1 to 2.4 μM. Interestingly, in Saos-2 osteosarcoma cells, MC3353 induced both expression of genes and mineralized the matrix as evidence of osteosarcoma to osteoblast differentiation.  Conclusions:   The present work describes MC3353 as a novel DNMTi displaying a stronger in cell demethylating ability than both 5-AZA and DAC, providing re-activation of the silenced ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase L1 (UCHL1) gene. MC3353 displayed dose- and time-dependent antiproliferative activity in several cancer cell types, inducing cell death and affecting EMT through E-cadherin and MMP2 modulation. In addition, this compound proved efficacy even in primary osteosarcoma cell models, through the modulation of genes involved in osteoblast differentiation.""","""['Clemens Zwergel#', 'Michael Schnekenburger#', 'Federica Sarno', 'Cecilia Battistelli', 'Maria Cristina Manara', 'Giulia Stazi', 'Roberta Mazzone', 'Rossella Fioravanti', 'Christina Gros', 'Frédéric Ausseil', 'Cristina Florean', 'Angela Nebbioso', 'Raffaele Strippoli', 'Toshikazu Ushijima', 'Katia Scotlandi', 'Marco Tripodi', 'Paola B Arimondo', 'Lucia Altucci', 'Marc Diederich', 'Antonello Mai', 'Sergio Valente']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Clin Epigenetics""","""['Correction: Identification of a novel quinoline-based DNA demethylating compound highly potent in cancer cells.', 'Selective non-nucleoside inhibitors of human DNA methyltransferases active in cancer including in cancer stem cells.', 'Disulfiram and its novel derivative sensitize prostate cancer cells to the growth regulatory mechanisms of the cell by re-expressing the epigenetically repressed tumor suppressor-estrogen receptor β.', 'Design, synthesis and biological evaluation of 4-amino-N- (4-aminophenyl)benzamide analogues of quinoline-based SGI-1027 as inhibitors of DNA methylation.', 'DNA Methyltransferase Inhibitors and their Therapeutic Potential.', 'DNA Methyltransferases Inhibitors from Natural Sources.', 'GSK-3484862 targets DNMT1 for degradation in cells.', 'Lupus nephritis: The regulatory interplay between epigenetic and MicroRNAs.', 'Correction: Identification of a novel quinoline-based DNA demethylating compound highly potent in cancer cells.', 'DNA Methyltransferases: From Evolution to Clinical Applications.', 'Structural characterization of dicyanopyridine containing DNMT1-selective, non-nucleoside inhibitors.']"""

In this study we sought to access whether there is, for urinary incontinence, any discrepancy between medical reports and the perception of patients.  Methods:   We performed a retrospective analysis of medical records of 337 patients subjected to radical retropubic prostatectomy (RRP) between 2005 and 2010. Sociodemographic variables were collected, as well as continence status over the course of treatment. Next, we contacted patients by phone to determine continence status at present and at time of their last appointment, as well as to apply ICIQ - SF questionnaire. Poisson regression model with robust variance was used to estimate the factors associated with discrepancy, using the stepwise backward strategy. Software used was Stata® (StataCorp, LC) version 11.0.  Results:   There is discrepancy between medical reports and patients' perceptions in 42.2% of cases. This discrepancy was found in 56% of elderly patients and 52% of men with low schooling, with statistical significance in these groups (p = 0.069 and 0.0001, respectively), whereas in multivariate regression analysis the discrepancy rate was significantly higher in black men (discrepancy rate of 52.6%) with low schooling (p = 0.004 and 0.043, respectively).

It has been demonstrated that GA is more mutagenic than AA. It has been shown that the proliferation rate of some cancer cells are increased by treatment with GA; however, the exact genes that are induced by GA in most cancer cells are not clear. In the present study, we demonstrated that GA promotes the growth of prostate cancer cells through induced protein expression of the cell cycle regulator. In addition, we also found that GA promoted the migratory ability of prostate cancer cells through induced epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-associated protein expression. In order to understand the potential prognostic relevance of GA-mediated regulators of the cell cycle and EMT, we present a three-gene signature to evaluate the prognosis of prostate cancer patients. Further investigations suggested that the three-gene signature (CDK4, TWIST1 and SNAI2) predicted the chances of survival better than any of the three genes alone for the first time. In conclusion, we suggested that the three-gene signature model can act as marker of GA exposure.

The pulses are delivered through minimally invasive needle electrodes inserted into the target tissue and lead to cell death through the creation of nanoscale membrane defects. IRE has been shown to be safe and effective when performed on tumors in the brain, liver, kidneys, pancreas, and prostate that are located near critical blood vessels and nerves. Accurate treatment planning and prediction of the ablation volume require a priori knowledge of the tissue-specific electric field threshold for cell death. This study addresses the challenge of defining an electric field threshold for human prostate cancer tissue. Three-dimensional reconstructions of the ablation volumes were created from one week post-treatment magnetic resonance imaging (MRIs) of ten patients who completed a clinical trial. The ablation volumes were incorporated into a finite element modeling software that was used to simulate patient-specific treatments, and the electric field threshold was calculated by matching the ablation volume to the field contour encompassing the equivalent volume. Solutions were obtained for static tissue electrical properties and dynamic properties that accounted for electroporation. According to the dynamic model, the electric field threshold was 506 ± 66 V/cm. Additionally, a potentially strong correlation (r = -0.624) was discovered between the electric field threshold and pre-treatment prostate-specific antigen levels, which needs to be validated in higher enrollment studies. Taken together, these findings can be used to guide the development of future IRE protocols.""","""['Sabrina Campelo', 'Massimo Valerio', 'Hashim U Ahmed', 'Yipeng Hu', 'Sara L Arena', 'Robert E Neal nd', 'Mark Emberton', 'Christopher B Arena']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""APL Bioeng""","""['Numerical simulation modeling of the irreversible electroporation treatment zone for focal therapy of prostate cancer, correlation with whole-mount pathology and T2-weighted MRI sequences.', 'In vivo characterization and numerical simulation of prostate properties for non-thermal irreversible electroporation ablation.', 'In vivo irreversible electroporation kidney ablation: experimentally correlated numerical models.', 'Irreversible electroporation: state of the art.', 'Introduction to Irreversible Electroporation--Principles and Techniques.', 'Determination of lethal electric field threshold for pulsed field ablation in ex vivo perfused porcine and human hearts.', 'Effects of different applied voltages of irreversible electroporation on prostate cancer in a mouse model.', 'A Comparative Modeling Study of Thermal Mitigation Strategies in Irreversible Electroporation Treatments.', 'Electromagnetically Stimuli-Responsive Nanoparticles-Based Systems for Biomedical Applications: Recent Advances and Future Perspectives.', 'Numerical simulation modeling of the irreversible electroporation treatment zone for focal therapy of prostate cancer, correlation with whole-mount pathology and T2-weighted MRI sequences.']"""

Methods:   Retrospective analyses of prospectively collected long-term data from a monocentric cohort of 350 men with D'Amico high-risk prostate cancer undergone robot-assisted radical prostatectomy at a single institution between 2005 and 2016.

Results:   Median age in the age group ≥ 70 years was 73 years compared with 62 years in the < 70 year age group. Distribution of men receiving adjuvant and salvage radiotherapy/hormonal therapy was similar in both age groups. Urinary continence recovery rate at 12, 24, and 36 months after surgery of men aged ≥ 70 years was 66, 79 and 83%, respectively, and statistically similar to that of men < 70 years: 71, 81, and 85% (log-rank test p = 0.24).

When comparing the incidence and mortality rates of PC, the Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results data of 2005-2014 show that Appalachian Kentucky had a lower incidence (113/100 000 v 137/100 000) but a higher mortality rate (23.8% v 21.8%) when compared to non-Appalachian Kentucky. The aim of this study was to further characterize the survival disparities of PC between Appalachian and non-Appalachian Kentucky.  Methods:   All stages of PC patients diagnosed between 2007 and 2011 were collected through the Kentucky Cancer Registry. Baseline characteristics and survival outcomes were compared between Appalachian Kentucky and non-Appalachian Kentucky, using Pearson χ2 and Cox regression analyses in this population-based analysis.  Results:   Of 12 871 patients studied, 3482 (26.8%) were from Appalachian Kentucky whereas 8489 (73.2%) were from non-Appalachian Kentucky. Caucasians predominated in both groups. Most Appalachian Kentucky patients were aged 65-74 years. Appalachian Kentucky patients had a higher Gleason score, higher prostate specific antigen (PSA), more aggressive histologic grade, more distant disease, higher comorbidity score, lower education, and higher poverty compared to patients from non-Appalachian Kentucky. There was a 5-year survival difference between Appalachian Kentucky and non-Appalachian Kentucky in unadjusted analysis (p<0.001) that disappeared after adjusting with Cox regression analysis (p=0.4). However, worsened survival was still seen with higher Gleason score, higher PSA, distant stage disease, higher Charlson comorbidity index, and very low high school education (p<0.001).  Conclusion:   In this population-based analysis, this study shows a significant difference in PC survival between Appalachian and non-Appalachian Kentucky.

To do this, multiwalled carbon nanotube (MWCNT)/L-histidine functionalized reduced graphene oxide (His-rGO) was demonstrated as a bifunctional nanoplatform for covalently attaching thionine redox indicator and anti-PSA antibody (Ab). The MWCNT enhanced electrical conductivity and facilitated the electron transfer between thionine and the glassy carbon electrode. While, the presence of anti-PSA antibody blocked the electron transfer of thionine and decreased redox signals. The principle response of proposed immunosensor was based on the selective interaction of PSA with thionine-NH2-GO-COOH-Ab. This selective interaction led to further decrease of response current of attached electrochemical probe. The liner calibration curve for tumor marker determination was 10 fg mL-1-20 ng mL-1 (R2 = 0.996). Under optimized conditions, the immunosensor was able to selectively detect PSA with a limit of detection (LOD) of 2.8 fg mL-1 at 3σ. The relative standard deviations (RSDs) for single-electrode repeatability and electrode-to-electrode reproducibility were less than 2.9% and 5.7% (n = 5), respectively. Furthermore, the as-proposed immunosensor showed excellent performance in detection of PSA in the human serum and saliva samples, which implies that the current strategy has a promising feature for the clinical assessment of tumor marker status in patients with prostate cancer.""","""['Leila Farzin', 'Sodeh Sadjadi', 'Mojtaba Shamsipur', 'Shahab Sheibani']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""J Pharm Biomed Anal""","""['Highly sensitive immunosensing of prostate-specific antigen based on ionic liquid-carbon nanotubes modified electrode: application as cancer biomarker for prostate biopsies.', 'Ultrasensitive electrochemical immunosensor for PSA biomarker detection in prostate cancer cells using gold nanoparticles/PAMAM dendrimer loaded with enzyme linked aptamer as integrated triple signal amplification strategy.', 'An electrochemical immunosensor for the prostate specific antigen based on the use of reduced graphene oxide decorated with gold nanoparticles.', 'Nanomaterial based aptasensing of prostate specific antigen (PSA): Recent progress and challenges in efficient diagnosis of prostate cancer using biomedicine.', 'Nanomaterial-based biosensors for detection of prostate specific antigen.', 'Microwave-Assisted Functionalization of Multi-Walled Carbon Nanotubes for Biosensor and Drug Delivery Applications.', 'Recent Advances in Electrochemical Immunosensors with Nanomaterial Assistance for Signal Amplification.', 'Multiwalled Carbon Nanotubes as Nanomaterial Tool in the Management of Prostate Cancer: A Possible Nanoformulation Approach.', 'Cancer Targeting and Diagnosis: Recent Trends with Carbon Nanotubes.', 'Properties and Applications of Graphene and Its Derivatives in Biosensors for Cancer Detection: A Comprehensive Review.']"""

Objective:   To determine if 1, 25-dihydroxy vitamin D3 [1,25(OH)2 D] plasma levels in AA and EA prostate cancer patients alter the risk of having aggressive prostate cancer.  Design:   Research subjects from the North Carolina-Louisiana Prostate Cancer Project (AA n = 435 and EA n = 532) were included.

Methods:   Gene expression levels after exposure to tobacco smoke condensate (TSC) were evaluated by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and Western blot analysis in prostate cancer cells. Cellular sensitivities to enzalutamide and docetaxel after TSC exposure were evaluated using a prostate cancer cell proliferation assay. Prognosis was compared between current smokers and nonsmokers when treated with AR-axis-targeting (ARAT) agent enzalutamide and docetaxel.  Results:   Expression of AR variants as well as prostate-specific antigen was augmented after TSC exposure, which occurred after Akt phosphorylation.

We optimized the bombesin-derived GRPR-antagonist PEG2 -RM26 for labeling with 177 Lu and further determined the effect of treatment with 177 Lu-labeled peptide alone or in combination with the anti-HER2 antibody trastuzumab in a murine model. The PEG2 -RM26 analog was coupled to NOTA, NODAGA, DOTA and DOTAGA chelators. The peptide-chelator conjugates were labeled with 177 Lu and characterized in vitro and in vivo. A preclinical therapeutic study was performed in PC-3 xenografted mice.

Therapy with 177 Lu-DOTAGA-PEG2 -RM26 induced a significant inhibition of tumor growth. The median survival for control groups was significantly shorter than for treated groups (Group C 66 days, Group E 74 days). Trastuzumab together with radionuclide therapy significantly improved survival. No treatment-related toxicity was observed. In conclusion, based on in vitro and in vivo characterization of the four 177 Lu-labeled PEG2 -RM26 analogs, we concluded that 177 Lu-DOTAGA-PEG2 -RM26 was the most promising analog for TRT.

Among the factors contributing to genomic instability are non-B DNA structures with stem-loops and quadruplexes being the most prevalent. We aimed at investigating the impact of specifically these two classes of non-B DNA structures on cancer breakpoint hotspots using machine learning approach.  Methods:   We developed procedure for machine learning model building and evaluation as the considered data are extremely imbalanced and it was required to get a reliable estimate of the prediction power. We built logistic regression models predicting cancer breakpoint hotspots based on the densities of stem-loops and quadruplexes, jointly and separately. We also tested Random Forest models varying different resampling schemes (leave-one-out cross validation, train-test split, 3-fold cross-validation) and class balancing techniques (oversampling, stratification, synthetic minority oversampling).  Results:   We performed analysis of 487,425 breakpoints from 2234 samples covering 10 cancer types available from the International Cancer Genome Consortium. We showed that distribution of breakpoint hotspots in different types of cancer are not correlated, confirming the heterogeneous nature of cancer. It appeared that stem-loop-based model best explains the blood, brain, liver, and prostate cancer breakpoint hotspot profiles while quadruplex-based model has higher performance for the bone, breast, ovary, pancreatic, and skin cancer. For the overall cancer profile and uterus cancer the joint model shows the highest performance. For particular datasets the constructed models reach high predictive power using just one predictor, and in the majority of the cases, the model built on both predictors does not increase the model performance.  Conclusion:   Despite the heterogeneity in breakpoint hotspots' distribution across different cancer types, our results demonstrate an association between cancer breakpoint hotspots and stem-loops and quadruplexes. Approximately for half of the cancer types stem-loops are the most influential factors while for the others these are quadruplexes. This fact reflects the differences in regulatory potential of stem-loops and quadruplexes at the tissue-specific level, which yet to be discovered at the genome-wide scale. The performed analysis demonstrates that influence of stem-loops and quadruplexes on breakpoint hotspots formation is tissue-specific.""","""['Kseniia Cheloshkina', 'Maria Poptsova']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""BMC Cancer""","""['Comprehensive analysis of cancer breakpoints reveals signatures of genetic and epigenetic contribution to cancer genome rearrangements.', 'Randomness in Cancer Breakpoint Prediction.', 'R-loops and regulatory changes in chronologically ageing fission yeast cells drive non-random patterns of genome rearrangements.', 'G-quadruplexes and their regulatory roles in biology.', 'The DNA secondary structures at telomeres and genome instability.', 'Dynamic alternative DNA structures in biology and disease.', 'Single-molecule imaging reveals replication fork coupled formation of G-quadruplex structures hinders local replication stress signaling.', 'Comprehensive analysis of cancer breakpoints reveals signatures of genetic and epigenetic contribution to cancer genome rearrangements.', 'KRAS-retroviral fusion transcripts and gene amplification in arsenic-transformed, human prostate CAsE-PE cancer cells.', ""A 'light-up' intercalator displacement assay for detection of triplex DNA stabilizers.""]"""

In addition, AOS could activate the Hippo/YAP pathway and block the recruitment of both the coactivator YAP and c-Jun. Furthermore, YAP interacted with the transcription factor c-Jun and regulated the transcriptional activity of the downstream target ST6Gal-1 gene.

STAT6 is associated with cancer cell proliferation, an increased malignancy and poor prognosis. Thus, techniques aimed at reducing or blocking STAT6 expression may be useful in treating STAT6high cancers. Among these cancers, colorectal and breast cancers represent two of the most common worldwide and their incidence is increasing every year. In 2018, colorectal and breast cancers represented 10.2% and 11.6% of all new cases of cancer diagnosed, respectively. In this study, four proprietary STAT6 specific small interfering RNA (siRNA) sequences were tested in vitro using the human colon adenocarcinoma cell line, HT-29, and the breast/duct carcinoma cell line, ZR-75-1. Decreases in STAT6 mRNA and protein levels were analysed to confirm the transfection was successful and STAT6 knockdown effects were measured by analysing cell proliferation and apoptosis. Results showed that 100nM siRNA concentration was the most effective and, although all individual sequences were capable of significantly inhibiting cell proliferation, STAT6 siRNA sequences 1 and 4 had the largest effects. STAT6 silencing also significantly induced apoptotic events. In conclusion, these results demonstrate that STAT6 siRNA sequences are capable of inhibiting proliferation of and inducing apoptosis of HT-29 colorectal cancer cells and ZR-75-1 breast cancer cells, halving the number of cancer cells in a short period of time. These experiments will be repeated in other STAT6high cancers in vitro, and animal studies in immunocompromised mice have been planned using xenografts of STAT6-expressing human colorectal and breast cancer cells. The STAT6 siRNA sequences therefore represent a potential treatment for STAT6high colorectal and breast cancers and a wide variety of other STAT6-expressing cancers.""","""['Carmen Salguero-Aranda', 'Daniel Sancho-Mensat', 'Beatriz Canals-Lorente', 'Sabena Sultan', 'Ajan Reginald', 'Lee Chapman']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Expression of Concern: STAT6 knockdown using multiple siRNA sequences inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis of human colorectal and breast cancer cell lines.', 'Signal transducer and activator of transcription-6 (STAT6) is a constitutively expressed survival factor in human prostate cancer.', 'Inhibition of STAT6/Anoctamin-1 Activation Suppresses Proliferation and Invasion of Gastric Cancer Cells.', 'Impact of STAT6 signaling pathway blockade on apoptosis of human colon cancer cells.', 'Long non-coding RNA RP11-468E2.5 curtails colorectal cancer cell proliferation and stimulates apoptosis via the JAK/STAT signaling pathway by targeting STAT5 and STAT6.', 'Small interfering RNA against transcription factor STAT6 inhibits allergic airway inflammation and hyperreactivity in mice.', 'Inhibition of STAT6 with Antisense Oligonucleotides Enhances the Systemic Antitumor Effects of Radiotherapy and Anti-PD-1 in Metastatic Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer.', 'siRNA and targeted delivery systems in breast cancer therapy.', 'SOX21-AS1 activated by STAT6 promotes pancreatic cancer progression via up-regulation of SOX21.', 'Small Interfering RNA in Colorectal Cancer Liver Metastasis Therapy.', 'PSOWNNs-CNN: A Computational Radiology for Breast Cancer Diagnosis Improvement Based on Image Processing Using Machine Learning Methods.']"""

However, recent reports of robotic salvage radical prostatectomy have demonstrated improved results. In this study we assessed salvage radical prostatectomy functional outcomes and complications when comparing robotic and open approaches.  Materials and methods:   We retrospectively collected data on salvage radical prostatectomy for recurrent prostate cancer after local nonsurgical treatment at 18 tertiary referral centers from 2000 to 2016. The Clavien-Dindo classification was applied to classify complications. Complications and functional outcomes were evaluated by univariable and multivariable analysis.  Results:   We included 395 salvage radical prostatectomies, of which 186 were open and 209 were robotic. Robotic salvage radical prostatectomy yielded lower blood loss and a shorter hospital stay (each p <0.0001). No significant difference emerged in the incidence of major and overall complications (10.1%, p=0.16, and 34.9%, p=0.67), including an overall low risk of rectal injury and fistula (1.58% and 2.02%, respectively). However, anastomotic stricture was more frequent for open salvage radical prostatectomy (16.57% vs 7.66%, p <0.01). Overall 24.6% of patients had had severe incontinence, defined as 3 or more pads per day, for 12 or 6 months. On multivariable analysis robotic salvage radical prostatectomy was an independent predictor of continence preservation (OR 0.411, 95% CI 0.232-0.727, p=0.022). Limitations include the retrospective nature of the study and the absence of a standardized surgical technique.  Conclusions:   In this contemporary series to our knowledge salvage radical prostatectomy showed a low risk of major complications and better functional outcomes than previously reported. Robotic salvage radical prostatectomy may reduce anastomotic stricture, blood loss and hospital stay, and improve continence outcomes.""","""['Paolo Gontero', 'Giancarlo Marra', 'Paolo Alessio', 'Claudia Filippini', 'Marco Oderda', 'Fernando Munoz', 'Estefania Linares', 'Rafael Sanchez-Salas', 'Ben Challacombe', 'Prokar Dasgupta', 'Sanchia Goonewardene', 'Rick Popert', 'Declan Cahill', 'David Gillatt', 'Raj Persad', 'Juan Palou', 'Steven Joniau', 'Thierry Piechaud', 'Alessandro Morlacco', 'Sharma Vidit', 'Morgan Rouprêt', 'Alexandre De La Taille', 'Simone Albisinni', 'Giorgio Gandaglia', 'Alexander Mottrie', 'Shreyas Joshi', 'Gabriel Fiscus', 'Andre Berger', 'Monish Aron', 'Henk Van Der Poel', 'Derya Tilki', 'Nathan Lawrentschuk', 'Declan G Murphy', 'Gordon Leung', 'John Davis', 'Robert Jeffrey Karnes;Collaborators']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""J Urol""","""['Comparative Outcomes of Salvage Retzius-Sparing versus Standard Robotic Prostatectomy: An International, Multi-Surgeon Series.', 'Robotic-assisted laparoscopic versus open salvage radical prostatectomy following radiotherapy.', 'Laparoscopic and robotic-assisted versus open radical prostatectomy for the treatment of localised prostate cancer.', 'Is the Toxicity of Salvage Prostatectomy Related to the Primary Prostate Cancer Therapy Received?', 'Comparison of perioperative, functional, and oncologic outcomes between standard laparoscopic and robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy: a systemic review and meta-analysis.', 'The Role of Salvage Radical Prostatectomy in Patients with Radiation-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Incidence of Rectal Injury After Radical Prostatectomy: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.', 'Linac-based stereotactic salvage reirradiation for intraprostatic prostate cancer recurrence: toxicity and outcomes.', 'Salvage Retzius-Sparing Radical Prostatectomy: A Review of Complications, Functional Outcomes, and Oncologic Outcomes.', 'Metastatic neuroendocrine carcinoma of right adrenal gland successfully treated with laparoscopic adrenalectomy after multimodal therapy.']"""

Materials and methods:   We queried ClinicalTrials.gov and the ISRCTN (International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial Number) Registry for closed phase III and IV trials focused on prostate, colorectal, kidney, bladder, testicular, breast and lung cancer. Identified trials were cross-verified with appropriate published data sources. Comparative accrual sufficiency and rates of race/ethnicity reporting were calculated. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to determine factors associated with accrual status and race/ethnicity reporting.  Results:   A total of 326 trials were identified based on our prespecified criteria, of which 63% reported sufficient accrual by time of closure and 58% reported data by race/ethnicity. Nonurological trials were significantly more likely to mention race data than urological trials (OR 3.25, 95% CI 1.24-8.55, p = 0.02). Industry sponsored trials were more likely to meet accrual targets than government funded projects (OR 5.44, 95% CI 1.64-18.20, p = 0.001). Although funding source did not influence race reporting, the reported recruitment of participants of African ethnicity was lower in industry sponsored trials (11.49% vs 3.18%, p <0.01). Two-thirds of the studies did not report baseline characteristics by African American race/ethnicity.  Conclusions:   Insufficient accrual and inadequate race/ethnicity reporting are prevalent issues, limiting interpretation of the results of clinical trials of major solid organ malignancies.

The self-assembling coat protein nanostructure offers various opportunities to modify the internal and external surfaces separately. After loading the internal cavity of the particles with the fluorescent dye Cy5.5 and paramagnetic Gd(III) complexes, we modified the outer surface by PEGylation and conjugation with targeting peptides. Using this combined approach, we were able to monitor a human prostate tumor model for up to 10 days by near-infrared fluorescence and magnetic resonance imaging, with up to 6% of the injection dose remaining.

Accurate segmentation of the prostate is key to biopsy needle placement, brachytherapy treatment planning, and motion management. Manual segmentation during these interventions is time-consuming and subject to inter- and intraobserver variation. To address these drawbacks, we aimed to develop a deep learning-based method which integrates deep supervision into a three-dimensional (3D) patch-based V-Net for prostate segmentation.  Methods and materials:   We developed a multidirectional deep-learning-based method to automatically segment the prostate for ultrasound-guided radiation therapy. A 3D supervision mechanism is integrated into the V-Net stages to deal with the optimization difficulties when training a deep network with limited training data. We combine a binary cross-entropy (BCE) loss and a batch-based Dice loss into the stage-wise hybrid loss function for a deep supervision training. During the segmentation stage, the patches are extracted from the newly acquired ultrasound image as the input of the well-trained network and the well-trained network adaptively labels the prostate tissue. The final segmented prostate volume is reconstructed using patch fusion and further refined through a contour refinement processing.  Results:   Forty-four patients' TRUS images were used to test our segmentation method. Our segmentation results were compared with the manually segmented contours (ground truth). The mean prostate volume Dice similarity coefficient (DSC), Hausdorff distance (HD), mean surface distance (MSD), and residual mean surface distance (RMSD) were 0.92 ± 0.03, 3.94 ± 1.55, 0.60 ± 0.23, and 0.90 ± 0.38 mm, respectively.  Conclusion:   We developed a novel deeply supervised deep learning-based approach with reliable contour refinement to automatically segment the TRUS prostate, demonstrated its clinical feasibility, and validated its accuracy compared to manual segmentation. The proposed technique could be a useful tool for diagnostic and therapeutic applications in prostate cancer.""","""['Yang Lei', 'Sibo Tian', 'Xiuxiu He', 'Tonghe Wang', 'Bo Wang', 'Pretesh Patel', 'Ashesh B Jani', 'Hui Mao', 'Walter J Curran', 'Tian Liu', 'Xiaofeng Yang']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Automatic prostate segmentation using deep learning on clinically diverse 3D transrectal ultrasound images.', 'Deeply supervised 3D fully convolutional networks with group dilated convolution for automatic MRI prostate segmentation.', 'Automated left ventricular myocardium segmentation using 3D deeply supervised attention U-net for coronary computed tomography angiography; CT myocardium segmentation.', 'All answers are in the images: A review of deep learning for cerebrovascular segmentation.', 'Tongue Contour Tracking and Segmentation in Lingual Ultrasound for Speech Recognition: A Review.', 'Artificial intelligence applications in prostate cancer.', 'A Robust and Explainable Structure-Based Algorithm for Detecting the Organ Boundary From Ultrasound Multi-Datasets.', 'Ultrasound Prostate Segmentation Using Adaptive Selection Principal Curve and Smooth Mathematical Model.', 'A review of artificial intelligence in prostate cancer detection on imaging.', 'Domain generalization for prostate segmentation in transrectal ultrasound images: A multi-center study.']"""

The aim of this study was to compare surgical outcomes in patients with rectal cancer with or without a history of prostate cancer.  Methods:   Patients who had surgery for rectal cancer with (PC group) or without (no-PC group) previous curative treatment for prostate cancer were enrolled between January 2001 and December 2015. Comparisons between the two groups were performed by multivariable Cox analysis, and after propensity score matching in a 3 : 1 ratio for demographic and tumour characteristics, and surgical and oncological outcomes.  Results:   A total of 944 patients with rectal cancer were enrolled, of whom 10·8 per cent had a history of prostate cancer. After matching, 83 patients who had received treatment for prostate cancer were compared with 249 who had not. The PC and no-PC groups were similar regarding patient characteristics. Extended total mesorectal excision, conversion to open surgery, transfusion and tumour perforation were more frequent in the PC group than in the no-PC group. Major surgical morbidity (28 versus 17·2 per cent; P = 0·036), anastomotic leakage (25 versus 13·7 per cent; P = 0·019) and permanent stoma (41 versus 12·4 per cent; P < 0·001) occurred more frequently in the PC group. Local recurrence was increased significantly in the PC group (17 versus 8·0 per cent; P = 0·019), and resulted in a significant decrease in disease-free and overall survival.

Materials and methods:   The data of the first 22 patients that were biopsied under robotic assistance were analyzed. Interventional planning relied on T2-weighted (T2w) turbo spin-echo (TSE) images (axial and sagittal) with a high-b-value diffusion-weighted acquisition added in selected cases. Alignment of the needle guide was controlled with a short balanced SSFP sequence in two oblique planes along the MR-visible sheath. Signals were acquired with a combination of elements from a 30-channel body and a 32-channel spine coil. Biopsy samples were taken with a fully automatic 18-G biopsy gun with a length of 150 or 175 mm.  Results:   Mean age was 66.6 years and average PSA level was 11.5 ng/ml. Fourteen out of 22 patients (63%) had received prior biopsies under transrectal ultrasound guidance. Diagnostic MRI reports (before biopsy) involved 17 cases with a single suspicious finding (four PI-RADS 3, one PI-RADS 3-4, eight PI-RADS 4 and nine PI-RADS 5 cases). The median effective procedure time was 33.9 (range 25.0-55.9) min for 16 cases with one CSR and 63.4 (52.7-81.8) min for 5 cases with two CSRs. The biopsy with three CSRs took 74.0 min. Histopathologic examination revealed prostate cancer in 14 of 22 cases.  Conclusion:   MR-targeted, transrectal biopsy of the prostate could be reliably performed with a robotic manipulator at a field strength of 1.5 T.

Methods and materials:   Thirty-five patients underwent AFT (12 were treated with primary BT, 7 with a combined primary treatment of external beam radiotherapy + BT, 16 with salvage BT). The isodose used for primary BT was 14400 cGy, 11,000 cGy after 4600 cGy of external beam radiotherapy in the combined group, and 14400 cGy for the salvage group. Patients underwent a CT scan at 1, 3, and 6 months to measure the distance between the rectum and the prostate.  Results:   An average of 32.7 cc (20-40) of fat was transferred successfully in 100% of cases. The mean distance to the rectum at the level of the base, middle, and apex at 1 and 6 months were 11.2, 9.7, and 7.6 mm; 8.3, 8.1, and 5.9 mm, respectively. No rectal toxicity or major complications were reported.  Conclusions:   The use of fat as an IRS seems to be a valid alternative to reduce rectal toxicity after BT, achieving equivalent distances to synthetic IRS. It is feasible, safe, and the loss of distance at 6 months is small. Cost is lower than other alternatives.""","""['Marcelo Borghi', 'Ezequiel Becher', 'Marcelo Bou', 'Luis Montes de Oca', 'Juan Fernandez Long', 'Luisa Rafailovici', 'Luisa Filomia', 'Edgardo F Becher']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Brachytherapy""","""['Placement of an absorbable rectal hydrogel spacer in patients undergoing low-dose-rate brachytherapy with palladium-103.', 'Polyethylene glycol hydrogel rectal spacer implantation in patients with prostate cancer undergoing combination high-dose-rate brachytherapy and external beam radiotherapy.', 'Transperineal injection of hyaluronic acid in anterior perirectal fat to decrease rectal toxicity from radiation delivered with intensity modulated brachytherapy or EBRT for prostate cancer patients.', 'High-dose-rate brachytherapy for prostate cancer in a previously radiated patient with polyethylene glycol hydrogel spacing to reduce rectal dose: case report and review of the literature.', 'Prostate-rectum spacers: optimization of prostate cancer irradiation.', 'Treating the primary in low burden metastatic prostate cancer: Where do we stand?']"""

Primary cancers responsible for penile metastases usually occur in prostate and rectum and are often associated with disseminated malignancy and poor prognosis.  Case description:   A 66-year-old man was diagnosed with adenocarcinoma of the tail of the pancreas after the onset of thrombosis of the dorsal vein of the penis; pubis ultrasound and total body computed tomography scan were negative for metastases at other sites. The patient was submitted to distal pancreatectomy with splenectomy for a pT3 N1 G4 pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. Three weeks after discharge, the patient returned to the outpatient clinic complaining of a painful permanent turgidity of the penis shaft. Ultrasound revealed a complete replacement of the cavernosal bodies by multiple nodular masses and a penile biopsy confirmed metastases from the primary pancreatic cancer. The patient started chemotherapy with NAB-paclitaxel and gemcitabine, with excellent control of symptoms. However, the disease progressed to bone and liver and the patient died 9 months after surgery.  Conclusions:   Penile localization is an extremely rare event and a standard of care has not been elaborated. Treatments are palliative and mainly aimed at pain relief and can comprise chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and surgery. Identification of venous thrombosis as an early sign of involvement could potentially offer patients an earlier diagnosis and a better treatment option.""","""['Matteo Virdis', 'Cristiana Bonifacio', 'Tatiana Brambilla', 'Giovanni Capretti', 'Pasquale De Nittis', 'Fara Uccelli', 'Alessandro Zerbi']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Tumori""","""['Penile metastases of rectal adenocarcinoma.', 'Penile metastasis in rectal cancer with pathologic complete response after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy: The first case report and literature review.', 'Penile metastasis of rectal carcinoma.

Patients were divided into two groups according to PSA level as 2.5-10 ng/mL (Group 1) and 10.01-20 ng/mL (Group 2). Diagnostic efficacy of thiol, disulphide and PSA levels were measured by ROC analysis.  Results:   A total of 76 patients were included in the study. There were 49 patients in group 1 and 27 patients in group 2. There was no significant difference between two groups in terms of PSA density and prostate size. In Group 1, area under curve (AUC) was higher in PSA than other parameters with statistically significant difference (p<.05). In group 2, AUC of native and total thiol was higher than PSA but there was no statistically significant difference for AUC in parameters.

The members of this series were prepared from acylbenzoquinones and phenylamines, in moderate to good yields (47-74%), through a procedure involving a sequence of two in situ regioselective oxidative amination reactions. The cyclic voltammograms of the aminoquinones exhibit two one-electron reduction waves to the corresponding radical-anion and dianion, and two quasi-reversible oxidation peaks. The first and second half-wave potential values (E1/2) of the members of the series were sensitive to the push-pull electronic effects of the substituents around the benzoquinone nucleus. The in vitro cytotoxic activities of the 3-acyl-2,5-bis(phenylamino)-1,4-benzoquinones against human cancer cells (bladder and prostate) and non-tumor human embryonic kidney cells were measured using the MTT colorimetric method. The substitution of both aniline groups, by either methoxy (electron donating effect) or fluorine (electron withdrawal effect), decreased the cytotoxicity in the aminoquinones. Among the members of the unsubstituted phenylamino series, two of the 18 compounds showed interesting anti-cancer activities.

Materials and methods:   A total of 7,989 CaPSURE participants completed questionnaires between 1996 and 2016 on the use of nearly 70 complementary and alternative medicine types. Participants were defined as users if they indicated that they had ever used complementary and alternative medicines. To evaluate trends among 7,696 patients with newly diagnosed prostate cancer we considered complementary and alternative medicine use within 24 months of diagnosis and calculated the percent change in complementary and alternative medicine use between groups defined by the year of diagnosis.  Results:   Of patients with prostate cancer 56% reported complementary and alternative medicine use on at least 1 questionnaire. Multivitamin and omega-3 fatty acid use was common at 40% and 24% of patients, respectively. Compared to nonusers greater proportions of complementary and alternative medicine users were college educated, had a higher household income and lived in the West and Midwest. Median prostate specific antigen at diagnosis was 5.8 (IQR 4.4-8.4) and 6.2 ng/ml (IQR 4.7-10.1) among users and nonusers, respectively (p <0.01). Between those diagnosed in 1996 to 2000 and 2011 to 2016, complementary and alternative medicine use increased 128% from 24% to 54%. When comparing participants diagnosed in 2006 to 2010 with those diagnosed in 2011 to 2016, a 108% increase was seen in supplemental vitamin D use and a -48% decrease was seen in supplemental vitamin E use.  Conclusions:   Many patients with prostate cancer reported complementary and alternative medicine use. Multivitamins and omega-3 fatty acids were commonly ingested and vitamin D use increased dramatically from 2006 to 2010 compared to 2011 to 2016.

However, there are no well-established preventable risk factors for prostate cancer, which warrants the need for further investigation into occupational factors to strengthen existing evidence. This study uses occupation and prostate cancer information from a large surveillance cohort in Ontario that linked workers' compensation claim data to administrative health databases.  Methods:   Occupations were examined using the Occupational Disease Surveillance System (ODSS). ODSS included 1 231 177 male workers for the 1983 to 2015 period, whose records were linked to the Ontario Cancer Registry (OCR) in order to identify and follow up on prostate cancer diagnoses. Cox proportional hazard models were used to calculate age-adjusted hazard ratios and 95% CI to estimate the risk of prostate cancer by occupation group.  Results:   A total of 34 997 prostate cancer cases were diagnosed among workers in ODSS. Overall, elevated prostate cancer risk was observed for men employed in management/ administration (HR 2.17, 95% CI = 1.98-2.38), teaching (HR 1.99, 95% CI = 1.79-2.21), transportation (HR 1.20, 95% CI = 1.16-1.24), construction (HR 1.09, 95% CI = 1.06-1.12), firefighting (HR 1.62, 95% CI = 1.47-1.78), and police work (HR 1.20, 95% CI = 1.10-1.32). Inconsistent findings were observed for clerical and farming occupations.  Conclusion:   Associations observed in white collar, construction, transportation, and protective services occupations were consistent with previous Canadian studies. Findings emphasize the need to assess job-specific exposures, sedentary behaviour, psychological stress, and shift work. Understanding specific occupational risk factors can lead to better understanding of prostate cancer etiology and improve prevention strategies.""","""['Jeavana Sritharan', 'Jill S MacLeod', 'Christopher B McLeod', 'Alice Peter', 'Paul A Demers']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Health Promot Chronic Dis Prev Can""","""['Incidence of acute myocardial infarction in the workforce: Findings from the Occupational Disease Surveillance System.', 'Breast cancer risk by occupation and industry in women and men: Results from the Occupational Disease Surveillance System (ODSS).', 'Incidence of mesothelioma and asbestosis by occupation in a diverse workforce.', 'A review of occupational disease surveillance systems in Modernet countries.', 'Occupation and thyroid cancer.', 'Cancer and Potential Prevention with Lifestyle among Career Firefighters: A Narrative Review.', 'Cancer risk among firefighters and police in the Ontario workforce.', 'Occupation and prostate Cancer risk: results from the epidemiological study of prostate cancer (EPICAP).', 'Cancer Incidence in World Trade Center Rescue and Recovery Workers: 14 Years of Follow-Up.', 'GSTP1 rs1138272 Polymorphism Affects Prostate Cancer Risk.']"""

It is measured using different self-report instruments that are not directly comparable, thereby making clinical trials, clinical performance measurement, and comparative effectiveness research challenging when anxiety is the outcome of interest. The objective of the current study was to enable a common reporting metric of anxiety so that scores on commonly used anxiety measures could be converted into Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) scores for ease of application, interpretation, and comparability.  Methods:   Using an internet health panel, a total of 806 men with clinically localized prostate cancer completed items from the National Institutes of Health PROMIS Anxiety Short Form (version 7a) and the 18-item Memorial Anxiety Scale for Prostate Cancer (MAX-PC). A common metric was created using analyses based on item response theory, producing score crosswalk tables. The linking relationships were evaluated by resampling small subsets and estimating confidence intervals for the differences between the observed and linked PROMIS scores.  Results:   Results of factor analysis and item response theory model fit supported the hypothesis that both scales measure essentially the same concept. Therefore, crosswalk tables appear to be justified and increasingly robust with increasing sample sizes.

Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analysis were used to investigate the function and pathways of DEGs. Subnetwork was further analyzed using BioNet. A total of 93 DEGs were identified. KEGG analysis showed downregulated TF genes (ID1 and ID3) were enriched in transforming growth factor-β pathway, whereas upregulated genes were involved in pathways associated with immune system, environmental sensing, and metabolism. GO analysis showed that downregulated genes were primarily enriched in cell cycle-related biological functions and upregulated DEGs were related to immune response, exogenous genetic material response, and viral response. Centromere protein F (CENPF) was identified as the central node of the regulatory subnetwork. In the PCAT1 knockdown LNCaP cells, the CENPF, ID1, and ID3 were obviously decreased based on the RT-PCR (quantitative real-time reverse transcription PCR) analysis.

The interaction of PD-L1 with its receptor PD-1 is considered an 'immune checkpoint' for possible cancer therapy. DU145 cells treated with the Dnmt3aC-1C plasmid showed significantly reduced expression of PD-L1 as compared to Dnmt3aC or Dnmt1C alone.

However, the clinical value of TLR-9 and MMP-13 co-expression in the pathophysiology of the prostate is unknown. In the study, we evaluated the expression levels and clinical significance of the TLR-9 and MMP-13 in a series of prostate tissues. One hundred and eighty prostate tissues including prostate cancer (PCa) (n = 137), high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (HPIN) (n = 18) and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) (n = 25) were immunostained for the TLR-9 and MMP-13 markers. Subsequently, the correlation between the TLR-9 and MMP-13 staining scores and clinicopathological parameters was obtained. Higher expressions of TLR-9 and MMP-13 were found in PCa and high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia compared to benign prostatic hyperplasia tissues. Among PCa samples, a positive relationship was revealed between the MMP-13 expression and Gleason score (P < 0.001). There was a significant correlation between TLR-9 expression and regional lymph node involvement (P = 0.04). The expression patterns of TLR-9 and MMP-13 markers demonstrated a reciprocal significant correlation between the two markers in the same series of prostate samples (P < 0.001). Furthermore, the Gleason score of TLR-9high /MMP-13high and TLR-9low /MMP-13low phenotypes showed a significant difference (P = 0.002). Higher expressions of TLR-9 and MMP-13 can confer aggressive behaviour to PCa.

In contrast, African American men present with more advanced disease, yet their tumors are less likely to acquire TMPRSS2-ERG. Data for Africa is scarce.  Methods:   RNA was made available for genomic analyses from 181 prostate tissue biopsy cores from Black South African men, 94 with and 87 without pathological evidence for prostate cancer. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction was used to screen for the TMPRSS2-ERG fusion, while transcript junction coordinates and isoform frequencies, including novel gene fusions, were determined using targeted RNA sequencing.  Results:   Here we report a frequency of 13% for TMPRSS2-ERG in tumors from Black South Africans. Present in 12/94 positive versus 1/87 cancer negative prostate tissue cores, this suggests a 92.62% predictivity for a positive cancer diagnosis (P = 0.0031). At a frequency of almost half that reported for African Americans and roughly a quarter of that reported for men of European ancestry, acquisition of TMPRSS2-ERG appears to be inversely associated with aggressive prostate cancer. Further support was provided by linking the presence of TMPRSS2-ERG to low-grade disease in younger patients (P = 0.0466), with higher expressing distal ERG fusion junction coordinates.

Materials and methods:   Two patients with prostate cancer underwent each two percutaneous in vivo needle-based OCT measurements before transperineal template mapping biopsy. The OCT probe was introduced via a needle and positioned under ultrasound guidance. To test the safety, adverse events were recorded during and after the procedure. To test the feasibility, OCT and US images were studied during and after the procedure. Corresponding regions for OCT and biopsy were determined. A uropathologist evaluated and annotated the histopathology. Three experts assessed all the corresponding OCT images. The OCT and biopsy conclusions for the corresponding regions were compared.  Results:   No adverse events during and following the, in total four, in vivo needle-based OCT measurements were reported. The OCT measurements showed images of prostatic tissue with a penetration depth of ~1.5 mm. The histological-proven tissue types, which were also found in the overlapping OCT images, were benign glands, stroma, glandular atrophy, and adenocarcinoma (Gleason pattern 3).  Conclusions:   Clinical in vivo needle-based OCT of the prostate is feasible with no adverse events during measurements. OCT images displayed detailed prostatic tissue with a imaging depth up to ~1.5 mm. We could co-register four histological-proven tissue types with OCT images.

SPOP, FOXA1, and IDH1 mutations are other three main oncogenic driver subclasses in non-ETS-fusion PrCa. ERG protein levels seem to be increased in SPOP-mutated cases, and different studies reported that SPOP mutations and ERG fusions are mutually exclusive. The aim of this study has been to analyze the alterations in non-ETS-oncogenic drivers in PrCa.  Methods:   SPOP, FOXA1, and IDH mutations were investigated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and Sanger direct sequencing. ERG, SPOP, and TMPRSS2-ERG messenger RNA expression was assessed by quantitative real-time PCR from complementary DNA, and the presence of the fusion was also analyzed by nonquantitative PCR. The clinical pathological features were retrieved from the charts of the 111 patients included in the study (MARBiobanc, Barcelona, Spain).  Results:   Loss of SPOP expression (25.2%) was associated with ERG overexpression (P = 0.0036). SPOP mutations were found in 5.4% cases, all with wild-type (wt) ERG (P = 0.007). FOXA1 mutations were found in 8.2% cases, most of them ERG wt (P = 0.06). No IDH1 mutations were found. SPOP or FOXA1 mutations were found in 1.7% of ERG-rearranged, and 34.2% of non-ERG-rearranged cases (P < 0.0001). SPOP or FOXA1 alterations (mutations or expression loss) were significantly more common in GG5, while isolated ERG overexpression was more common in GG1 tumors (P = 0.042). SPOP-or FOXA1-mutated cases were associated with a shorter time to prostate-specific antigen (PSA) recurrence in the univariate (P = 0.0009), and with the PSA recurrence risk in the multivariate (P = 0.023) analysis.  Conclusions:   In conclusion, SPOP and FOXA1 mutations may have prognostic value in ERG wt tumors.

There is evidence from observational and intervention studies that milk and dairy products intake is associated with higher IGF-1 concentrations, but results were not always consistent. The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between dairy intake and circulating IGF-1 concentrations in participants of the Second Bavarian Food Consumption Survey, thereby providing data for a German population for the first time.  Methods:   In this cross-sectional study of 526 men and women aged 18-80 years, in contrast to most previous investigations, dietary intake was assessed with a more detailed instrument than food frequency questionnaires (FFQs), i.e., by three 24-h dietary recalls conducted on random days close in time to the blood collection. Circulating IGF-1 concentrations were measured in blood samples. Multivariable linear regression models were used to examine the association of dairy intake with IGF-1 concentrations.  Results:   Each 400 g increment in daily dairy intake was associated with 16.8 µg/L (95% CI 6.9, 26.7) higher IGF-1 concentrations. Each 200 g increment in milk per day was associated with 10.0 µg/L (95% CI 4.2, 15.8) higher IGF-1. In contrast, we observed no association between cheese or yogurt intake and IGF-1 concentrations.

This study was designed to investigate the potential of Ribosomal Protein L22-like1 (RPL22L1) and Ribosomal Protein S21 (RPS21) as diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for PCa. First, RPL22L1 and RPS21 were screened as the key molecular of PCa by bioinformatics analysis. Subsequently, the prostate tissue samples were stained for antibodies against RPL22L1 and RPS21. The unbiased signal quantification was performed by ImageJ software, and the results showed that the expression of RPL22L1 and RPS21 exhibited significant differences between the PCa tissues and the normal prostate tissues. Receiver-operating characteristics (ROC) curves were prepared, and then the area under the curve (AUC) values of RPL22L1 and RPS21 were calculated as 0.798 and 0.768, and the likelihood ratio (LR) values of RPL22L1 and RPS21 were calculated as 2.86 and 2.53. These data implied that the over-expression of RPL22L1 and RPS21 is associated with the presence of PCa. The further analysis suggested that the expression of RPL22L1 and RPS21 were significantly higher in high Gleason grade than they were in low Gleason grade. In addition, in vitro studies were undertaken to evaluate the roles of RPL22L1 and RPS21 in PCa. The results revealed that these genes promote PCa cell proliferation, migration and invasion, and inhibit PCa cell apoptosis. Taken together, these data showed that RPL22L1 and RPS21 exhibited higher expression in human prostate cancer tissue, and involved in PCa cell proliferation and invasion.

It is found that the dispersed AuNPs rather than the aggregated ones can quench effectively the fluorescence of Tb-MOFs, and the quenching process presumably involves the mechanism of inner filter effect (IFE), dynamic quenching effect (DQE), and fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET). The different affinities of aptamer and aptamer-target complex toward AuNPs are employed to modulate the fluorescence signal change of Tb-MOFs. As the proof of concept, prostate-specific antigen (PSA), an efficient tumor indicator for prostate cancer, is selected as the target. At first, the PSA aptamer can protect AuNPs against salt-induced aggregation, leading to the fluorescence of Tb-MOFs quenching. Subsequently, upon PSA introduction, the rigid aptamer-PSA complex is formed and cannot stabilize AuNPs in high salt conditions, so the AuNPs aggregate significantly and the fluorescence of Tb-MOFs is restored. The linear range of PSA is achieved from 1 to 100 ng/mL with a detection limit of 0.36 ng/mL. Finally, this method has been validated to be sensitive and specific for PSA in human urine samples.

However, consumption of dairy is decreasing and moving away from the advised level in many countries and the potential benefits of milk and dairy products for health have come under question. This, in spite that numerous studies report health benefits associated with dairy consumption. The present supplement aims to assess and summarize scientific evidence regarding the impact of dairy intake on health and all-cause mortality, and on the prevention of diverse chronic diseases, mainly from meta-analyses of observational studies and randomized controlled trials (RCTs). There seem to positive associations between moderate maternal milk intake during pregnancy and infant birth weight, length and bone mineral content during childhood. Moreover, consumption of dairy products in older subjects may reduce the risk of frailty and decrease the risk for sarcopenia. The highest consumption of dairy products did not show a clear association with total osteoporotic fracture and hip fracture risk; however, a diminished risk of vertebral fracture was found. Analysis of the differences between high and low dairy consumption and for dose-response found no association between dairy product consumption and risk of all-cause mortality. Total and low-fat dairy consumption is associated with a reduced risk of developing metabolic syndrome and current evidence supports that consumption of dairy does not adversely affect the risk of cardiovascular outcomes and may even have a subtle protective effect. Moreover, evidence has been provided of an inverse association between the consumption of dairy products and ischemic heart disease and myocardial infarction. Also, the evidence suggests that dairy consumption, particularly low-fat dairy and yogurt is associated with a lower risk of type 2 diabetes. Likewise, moderate compared with medium consumption of dairy is associated lower risk for colorectal and bladder cancer and has no association with prostate cancer. Finally, consumption of milk or dairy products did not show a proinflammatory effect on healthy subjects, overweight/obese individuals, or individuals with other metabolic abnormalities, and fortification of dairy products with phytosterols and ω-3 fatty acids seems to be a good approach to improve cardiometabolic risk biomarkers. In conclusion, the systematic reviews and meta-analyses of the present supplement support adequate milk consumption at various stages of life and in the prevention/control of various noncommunicable chronic diseases.""","""['Ángel Gil', 'Rosa M Ortega']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Adv Nutr""","""['Role of Functional Fortified Dairy Products in Cardiometabolic Health: A Systematic Review and Meta-analyses of Randomized Clinical Trials.', 'Nutritional value of dairy products and recommended daily consumption.', 'Milk and Dairy Product Consumption and Cardiovascular Diseases: An Overview of Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses.', 'Effect of Milk and Other Dairy Products on the Risk of Frailty, Sarcopenia, and Cognitive Performance Decline in the Elderly: A Systematic Review.', 'Folic acid supplementation and malaria susceptibility and severity among people taking antifolate antimalarial drugs in endemic areas.', 'Dairy products intake and the risk of postpartum depression among mothers: A pilot study.', 'The Beneficial Effects of Soybean Proteins and Peptides on Chronic Diseases.', 'Shaping the Physicochemical, Functional, Microbiological and Sensory Properties of Yoghurts Using Plant Additives.', 'Taste Responses and Ingestive Behaviors to Ingredients of Fermented Milk in Mice.', 'Effect of Social Beliefs on Consumption of Dairy Products and Its Predicting Factors Based on the Transtheoretical Model: A Population-Based Study.']"""

The only previous prospective study found a 2% reduced prostate cancer risk per unit increase in MSP.

Patients and methods:   A nested case-control study was conducted with the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) with 1871 cases and 1871 matched controls. Conditional logistic regression analysis was used to investigate the association of pre-diagnostic circulating MSP with risk of incident prostate cancer overall and by tumour subtype. EPIC-derived estimates were combined with published data to calculate an MR estimate using two-sample inverse-variance method.  Results:   Plasma MSP concentrations were inversely associated with prostate cancer risk after adjusting for total prostate-specific antigen concentration [odds ratio (OR) highest versus lowest fourth of MSP = 0.65, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.51-0.84, Ptrend = 0.001]. No heterogeneity in this association was observed by tumour stage or histological grade. Plasma MSP concentrations were 66% lower in rs10993994 TT compared with CC homozygotes (per allele difference in MSP: 6.09 ng/ml, 95% CI 5.56-6.61, r2=0.42).

Limitations include lack of complete tumour subtype information and more complete information on the biological function of MSP.

Material and methods:   Forty patients received a (68Ga)-PSMA PET/CT for biochemical failure. Following the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) guidelines, the pelvic clinical target volume has been contoured. Bone metastases were considered as outside the clinical target volume. Two subgroups of patients were defined, patients having relapse: (1) inside, or (2) outside the clinical target volume.  Results:   Globally, eight patients out of 32 presented with a positive lymph node failure inside the clinical target volume according to RTOG guidelines (25%), 22 patients had nodal relapses outside this clinical target volume (68.75%) and in two patients nodal relapses occurred both inside and outside of the clinical target volume (6.25%).

High IQGAP3/BMP4 and IQGAP3/FAM107A ratios in urinary cell-free DNA (ucfDNA) are a diagnostic biomarker for bladder cancer. We aimed to investigate whether the levels of these biomarkers in ucfDNA can be used to monitor disease recurrence or progression in patients with NMIBC.  Patients and methods:   A total of 103 patients with NMIBC (pTa-pT1) were enrolled. The IQGAP3/BMP4 and IQGAP3/FAM107A ratios in ucfDNA were measured by real-time PCR, and the results were compared with clinical outcome by Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox regression analyses.  Results:   Overall, 55 patients (53.4%) experienced recurrence and 29 (28.2%) experienced disease progression during a median follow-up of 42.7 months (range, 6.1-172.2 months). Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed that NMIBC patients with a high IQGAP3/BMP4 ratio had worse recurrence-free survival and progression-free survival (PFS) (P = .001 and < .001, respectively), and those with a high IQGAP3/FAM107A ratio had worse PFS (P = .006). Multivariate Cox regression analysis revealed that the IQGAP3/BMP4 ratio was independently associated with recurrence-free survival (hazard ratio, 2.462; P = .003) and PFS (hazard ratio = 3.871; P = .004), whereas the IQGAP3/FAM107A ratio was not an independent factor for PFS (P = .079).

With the advent of high-throughput sequencing technology, a huge amount of genomic data generates at every second which offer many valuable cancer information and meanwhile throw a big challenge to those investigators. As the major characteristic of cancer is heterogeneity and most of alterations are supposed to be useless passenger mutations that make no contribution to the cancer progress. Hence, how to dig out driver genes that have effect on a selective growth advantage in tumor cells from those tremendously and noisily data is still an urgent task.  Results:   Considering previous network-based method ignoring some important biological properties of driver genes and the low reliability of gene interactive network, we proposed a random walk method named as Subdyquency that integrates the information of subcellular localization, variation frequency and its interaction with other dysregulated genes to improve the prediction accuracy of driver genes. We applied our model to three different cancers: lung, prostate and breast cancer. The results show our model can not only identify the well-known important driver genes but also prioritize the rare unknown driver genes. Besides, compared with other existing methods, our method can improve the precision, recall and fscore to a higher level for most of cancer types.  Conclusions:   The final results imply that driver genes are those prone to have higher variation frequency and impact more dysregulated genes in the common significant compartment.

Methods:   The records of 3210 consecutive men with prostate cancer who underwent radical prostatectomy between January 1998 and June 2013 were retrospectively reviewed. Patients with BCR were divided into three groups based on quartiles of time to BCR, namely an early group (first quartile), an intermediate group (second and third quartiles) and late group (fourth quartile).  Results:   817 (25.5%) patients experienced BCR at a median of 24.9 months after surgery. The 8-year rate of distant metastasis-free survival (64.3% vs. 41.3%, p = 0.002) and cancer-specific survival (86.6% vs. 63.4%, p < 0.001) was higher in the salvage radiotherapy (SRT) group than the androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) group in patients with early BCR, whereas those rates (91.3% vs. 87.9%, p = 0.607 and 100.0% vs. 93.1%, p = 0.144, respectively) were similar in patients with late BCR. In the intermediate BCR group, the impact of SRT over ADT on 8-year cancer-specific survival was modest (91.9% vs. 82.3%, p = 0.057) and was limited to patients with pT2 or pT3a disease.  Conclusions:   SRT may decrease the risk of distant metastasis and cancer-specific mortality in patients with early BCR. However, a survival benefit for those with late BCR was not apparent. For patients with intermediate BCR, SRT was associated with a cancer-specific survival benefit in patients with pT2 or pT3a disease.

Here we assessed mLST8 loss in a panel of normal and cancer cells and observed little to no impact on assembly or activity of mTORC1. However, mLST8 loss blocked mTOR association with mTORC2 cofactors RICTOR and SIN1, thus abrogating mTORC2 activity. Similarly, a single pair of mutations on mLST8 with a corresponding mutation on mTOR interfered with mTORC2 assembly and activity without affecting mTORC1. We also discovered a direct interaction between mLST8 and the NH2-terminal domain of the mTORC2 cofactor SIN1. In PTEN-null prostate cancer xenografts, mLST8 mutations disrupting the mTOR interaction motif inhibited AKT S473 phosphorylation and decreased tumor cell proliferation and tumor growth in vivo. Together, these data suggest that the scaffolding function of mLST8 is critical for assembly and activity of mTORC2, but not mTORC1, an observation that could enable therapeutic mTORC2-selective inhibition as a therapeutic strategy. SIGNIFICANCE: These findings show that mLST8 functions as a scaffold to maintain mTORC2 integrity and kinase activity, unveiling a new avenue for development of mTORC2-specific inhibitors.""","""['Yoonha Hwang#', 'Laura C Kim#', 'Wenqiang Song', 'Deanna N Edwards', 'Rebecca S Cook', 'Jin Chen']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Cancer Res""","""['Dynamic modelling of the PI3K/MTOR signalling network uncovers biphasic dependence of mTORC1 activity on the mTORC2 subunit SIN1.', 'Discrete signaling mechanisms of mTORC1 and mTORC2: Connected yet apart in cellular and molecular aspects.', 'Diverse signaling mechanisms of mTOR complexes: mTORC1 and mTORC2 in forming a formidable relationship.', 'TRAF2 and OTUD7B govern a ubiquitin-dependent switch that regulates mTORC2 signalling.', 'Ablation in mice of the mTORC components raptor, rictor, or mLST8 reveals that mTORC2 is required for signaling to Akt-FOXO and PKCalpha, but not S6K1.', 'Dock7 regulates AKT and mTOR/S6K activity required for the transformed phenotypes and survival of cancer cells.', 'GOLPH3 protein controls organ growth by interacting with TOR signaling proteins in Drosophila.', 'New mechanistic insights into the RAS-SIN1 interaction at the membrane.', 'mTOR: A Potential New Target in Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease.', 'Macrophage Polarization and Reprogramming in Acute Inflammation: A Redox Perspective.']"""

However, compared with other tumor types, extensive aneuploidy is relatively rare in prostate cancer. Thus, whether numerical chromosome aberrations dictate disease progression in prostate cancer patients is not known. Here, we report the development of a method based on whole-transcriptome profiling that allowed us to identify chromosome-arm gains and losses in 333 primary prostate tumors. In two independent cohorts (n = 404) followed prospectively for metastases and prostate cancer-specific death for a median of 15 years, increasing extent of tumor aneuploidy as predicted from the tumor transcriptome was strongly associated with higher risk of lethal disease. The 23% of patients whose tumors had five or more predicted chromosome-arm alterations had 5.3 times higher odds of lethal cancer (95% confidence interval, 2.2 to 13.1) than those with the same Gleason score and no predicted aneuploidy. Aneuploidy was associated with lethality even among men with high-risk Gleason score 8-to-10 tumors.

It blocks androgen binding to the AR, AR nuclear translocation, and AR-mediated DNA binding. Unfortunately, a considerable proportion of tumors eventually develop resistance during the treatment. The molecular mechanisms underlying enzalutamide resistance are not completely understood. Enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2), the catalytic subunit of polycomb repressor complex 2, has been proposed as a prognostic marker for prostate cancer (PCa). With the goal to test whether EZH2 also plays a critical role in acquisition of enzalutamide resistance in CRPC, here we examined whether EZH2 inhibition/depletion enhances the efficacy of enzalutamide in enzalutamide-resistant PCa cells. We show that combining the EZH2 inhibitor GSK126 with enzalutamide synergistically inhibits cell proliferation and colony formation and promotes apoptosis in enzalutamide-resistant PCa cells. EZH2 depletion also overcomes enzalutamide resistance in both cultured cells and xenograft tumors. Mechanistically, we found that EZH2 directly binds to the promoter of prostate-specific antigen and inhibits its expression in enzalutamide-resistant PCa cells. In agreement, bioinformatics analysis of clinical RNA sequencing data involving GSEA indicated a strong correlation between AR and EZH2 gene expression during PCa progression. Our study provides critical insights into the mechanisms underlying enzalutamide resistance, which may offer new approaches to enhance the efficacy of enzalutamide in CRPC.""","""['Yunfeng Bai', 'Zhuangzhuang Zhang', 'Lijun Cheng', 'Ruixin Wang', 'Xiaoliang Chen', 'Yifan Kong', 'Feng Feng', 'Nihal Ahmad', 'Lang Li', 'Xiaoqi Liu']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""J Biol Chem""","""['Inhibition of noncanonical Wnt pathway overcomes enzalutamide resistance in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Dual targeting of EZH2 and androgen receptor as a novel therapy for castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Niclosamide inhibits androgen receptor variants expression and overcomes enzalutamide resistance in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Understanding the mechanisms of androgen deprivation resistance in prostate cancer at the molecular level.', 'Enzalutamide, an oral androgen receptor inhibitor for treatment of castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'A synthetic lethal screen for Snail-induced enzalutamide resistance identifies JAK/STAT signaling as a therapeutic vulnerability in prostate cancer.', 'Simultaneous administration of EZH2 and BET inhibitors inhibits proliferation and clonogenic ability of metastatic prostate cancer cells.', 'Exploring anti-androgen therapies in hormone dependent prostate cancer and new therapeutic routes for castration resistant prostate cancer.', 'Histone lysine methylation patterns in prostate cancer microenvironment infiltration: Integrated bioinformatic analysis and histological validation.', 'EZH2 Inhibition and Cisplatin as a Combination Anticancer Therapy: An Overview of Preclinical Studies.']"""

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is used for this purpose; however, radiation therapy-induced changes complicate image interpretation, and guidelines are lacking on the assessment and delineation of recurrent PCa. A tumor probability (TP) model was trained and independently tested using multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mp-MRI) of patients with radio-recurrent PCa. The resulting probability maps were used to derive target regions for radiation therapy treatment planning.  Methods and materials:   Two cohorts of patients with radio-recurrent PCa were used in this study. All patients underwent mp-MRI (T2 weighted, diffusion-weighted imaging, and dynamic contrast enhanced). A logistic regression model was trained using imaging features from 21 patients with biopsy-proven recurrence who qualified for salvage treatment. The test cohort consisted of 17 patients treated with salvage prostatectomy. The model was tested against histopathology-derived tumor delineations. The voxel-wise TP maps were clustered using k-means to generate a gross tumor volume (GTV) contour for voxel-level comparisons with manual tumor delineations performed by 2 radiologists and with histopathology-validated contours. Later, k-means was used with 3 clusters to define a clinical target volume (CTV), high-risk CTV, and GTV, with increasing tumor risk.  Results:   In the test cohort, the model obtained a median (range) area under the curve of 0.77 (0.41-0.99) for the whole prostate. The GTV delineation resulted in a median sensitivity of 0.31 (0-0.87) and specificity of 0.97 (0.84-1.0) with no significant differences between model and manual delineations. The 3-level clustering GTV and high-risk CTV delineations had median sensitivities of 0.17 (0-0.59) and 0.49 (0-0.97) and specificities of 0.98 (0.84-1.00) and 0.94 (0.84-0.99), respectively.  Conclusions:   The TP model had a good performance in predicting voxel-wise presence of recurrent tumor. Model-derived tumor risk levels achieved sensitivity and specificity similar to manual delineations in localizing recurrent tumor.

We reported previously that androgen receptor (AR) antagonist induces telomere DNA damage in androgen-sensitive LNCaP prostate cancer cells; this triggers a DNA damage response (DDR) at telomeres that includes activation of ATM, and blocking ATM activation prevents telomere DNA repair and leads to cell death. Remarkably, AR antagonist induces telomere DNA damage and triggers ATM activation at telomeres also in 22Rv1 castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) cells that are not growth inhibited by AR antagonist. Treatment with AR antagonist enzalutamide (ENZ) or ATM inhibitor (ATMi) by itself had no effect on growth in vitro or in vivo, but combined treatment with ENZ plus ATMi significantly inhibited cell survival in vitro and tumor growth in vivo. By inducing telomere DNA damage and activating a telomere DDR, an opportunity to inhibit DNA repair and promote cell death was created, even in CRPC cells. 22Rv1 cells express both full-length AR and AR splice variant AR-V7, but full-length AR was found to be the predominant form of AR associated with telomeres and required for telomere stability. Although 22Rv1 growth of untreated 22Rv1 cells appears to be driven by AR-V7, it is, ironically, expression of full-length AR that makes them sensitive to growth inhibition by combined treatment with ENZ plus ATMi. Notably, this combined treatment approach to induce telomere DNA damage and inhibit the DDR was effective in inducing cell death also in other CRPC cell lines (LNCaP/AR and C4-2B). Thus, the use of ENZ in combination with a DDR inhibitor, such as ATMi, may be effective in prolonging disease-free survival of patients with AR-positive metastatic CRPC, even those that co-express AR splice variant.""","""['Vidyavathi Reddy', 'Asm Iskander', 'Clara Hwang', 'George Divine', 'Mani Menon', 'Evelyn R Barrack', 'G Prem-Veer Reddy', 'Sahn-Ho Kim']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Generation 2.5 antisense oligonucleotides targeting the androgen receptor and its splice variants suppress enzalutamide-resistant prostate cancer cell growth.', 'Multimodal actions of the phytochemical sulforaphane suppress both AR and AR-V7 in 22Rv1 cells: Advocating a potent pharmaceutical combination against castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Preclinical Study using Malat1 Small Interfering RNA or Androgen Receptor Splicing Variant 7 Degradation Enhancer ASC-J9® to Suppress Enzalutamide-resistant Prostate Cancer Progression.', 'Androgen receptor targeting drugs in castration-resistant prostate cancer and mechanisms of resistance.', 'Androgen receptors in hormone-dependent and castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Saracatinib synergizes with enzalutamide to downregulate AR activity in CRPC.', 'Androgen Receptor Upregulates Mucosa-Associated Lymphoid Tissue 1 to Induce NF-κB Activity via Androgen-Dependent and -Independent Pathways in Prostate Carcinoma Cells.', 'Idarubicin combats abiraterone and enzalutamide resistance in prostate cells via targeting XPA protein.', 'Oxidative stress and redox signaling in CRPC progression: therapeutic potential of clinically-tested Nrf2-activators.', 'Targeting DNA Damage Response in Prostate and Breast Cancer.']"""

Therefore, it is essential for orthopaedic surgeons to understand the differences in care required by this growing subpopulation. Although the current research suggests that good outcomes can be predicted when appropriately optimized patients with cancer undergo lower extremity total joint arthroplasty, similar studies for TSA are lacking. The primary study question was to examine whether a history of cancer was associated with an increased rate of venous thromboembolism (VTE) after TSA. Secondarily, we sought to examine any association between a history of prostate and breast cancer and surgical or medical complications after TSA.  Methods:   Using a national insurance database, male patients with a history of prostate cancer and female patients with a history of breast cancer undergoing anatomic TSA for primary osteoarthritis were identified and compared with control subjects matched 3:1 based on age, sex, diabetes mellitus, and tobacco use. Patients with a history of VTE and patients who underwent reverse TSA or hemiarthroplasty were excluded.  Results:   Female patients with a history of breast cancer and male patients with a history of prostate cancer undergoing TSA had significantly higher incidences of acute VTE (including deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism) compared with matched control subjects (female patients: odds ratio, 1.41; 95% confidence interval, 1.10 to 1.81; P = 0.024 and male patients: odds ratio, 1.37; 95% confidence interval, 1.05 to 1.79; P = 0.023). No significant differences were noted in the incidences of any other complications assessed.  Conclusion:   Although a personal history of these malignancies does represent a statistically significant risk factor for acute VTE after anatomic TSA, the overall VTE rate remains modest and acceptable. The rates of other surgical and medical complications are not significantly increased in patients with a history of these cancers after TSA compared with control subjects.""","""['Dennis Q Chen', 'Samuel R Montgomery Jr', 'Jourdan M Cancienne', 'Brian C Werner']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""J Am Acad Orthop Surg""","""['Is Hepatitis C Infection Associated With a Higher Risk of Complications After Total Shoulder Arthroplasty?', 'Trends in Venous Thromboembolism After Shoulder Arthroplasty in the United States: Analysis Following the 2009 American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons Clinical Practical Guidelines.', 'Venous Thromboembolism After Total Shoulder Arthroplasty: A Database Study of 31,918 Cases.', 'Venous Thromboembolism After Shoulder Arthoplasty and Arthroscopy.', 'Venous thromboembolism after shoulder arthroplasty: a systematic review.', 'Intraoperative and early postoperative complications of reverse shoulder arthroplasty: A current concepts review.', 'Incidence and Related Factors for Low-Extremity Deep Vein Thrombosis in Breast Cancer Patients Who Underwent Surgical Resection: What Do We Know and What Should We Care.']"""

Twenty patients receiving passive scattered proton therapy (PSPT) and fifteen patients receiving intensity modulated proton therapy (IMPT) were compared to twenty patients treated with 7-field intensity modulated photon therapy (IMRT). For proton beam therapy (PBT), the RBE was estimated using two different RBE models. Tumor control probabilities (TCP) and normal tissue complication probabilities (NTCP) were assessed. For one of the RBE models, dosimetric indices assuming a low α/β were ~10%-11% larger compared to using a fixed RBE. A different model resulted in 1%-3% lower values independent of α/β. Comparing PBT with IMRT revealed a negligible difference in TCP for a fixed RBE. Applying a variable RBE revealed an increase in TCP by 6% for PBT compared to IMRT for one model but a decrease of 2% for the other. Variable RBE values in PSPT resulted in an increase in NTCP for rectum from 7% to 11% for a fixed RBE with one model but a decrease to 6% for another. For IMPT, NTCP increased from 5% to 9% for a fixed RBE for one model but decreased to 3% using the other. The NTCP for bladder increased for PSPT for both models, from 11% to 19% and 14%, respectively. For IMPT, the NTCP increased from 12% to 17% using one model but decreased to 11% with the other. In radiation therapy for prostate cancer, disregarding variable RBE may lead to either underestimation or overestimation of the expected TCP and NTCP, depending on the RBE model and α/β.

Recently machine learning techniques have been proposed for IMRT dose prediction based on patient's contour information from planning CT. In these existing prediction models geometric/anatomic features were learned for building the dose prediction models and few features that characterize the dosimetric properties of the patients were utilized. In this study we propose a method to incorporate the dosimetric features in the construction of a more reliable dose prediction model based on the deep convolutional neural network (CNN). In addition to the contour information, the dose distribution from a PTV-only plan (i.e. the plan with the best PTV coverage by sacrificing the OARs sparing) is also employed as the model input to build a deep learning based dose prediction model. A database of 60 volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) plans for the prostate cancer patients was used for training. The trained prediction model was then tested on a cohort of ten cases. Dose difference maps, DVHs, dosimetric endpoints and statistical analysis of the sum of absolute residuals (SARs) were used to evaluate the proposed method. Our results showed that the mean SARs for the PTV, bladder and rectum using our method were 0.007 ± 0.003, 0.035 ± 0.032 and 0.067 ± 0.037 respectively, lower than the SARs obtained with the contours-based method, indicating the potential of the proposed approach in accurately predicting dose distribution.""","""['Ming Ma', 'Nataliya Kovalchuk', 'Mark K Buyyounouski', 'Lei Xing', 'Yong Yang']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Phys Med Biol""","""['Dosimetric features-driven machine learning model for DVH prediction in VMAT treatment planning.', 'Attention-aware 3D U-Net convolutional neural network for knowledge-based planning 3D dose distribution prediction of head-and-neck cancer.', 'Dose distribution prediction in isodose feature-preserving voxelization domain using deep convolutional neural network.', 'Evaluation of dose-volume histogram prediction for organ-at risk and planning target volume based on machine learning.', 'Knowledge-based radiation treatment planning: A data-driven method survey.', 'Combining distance and anatomical information for deep-learning based dose distribution predictions for nasopharyngeal cancer radiotherapy planning.', 'A Survey on Deep Learning for Precision Oncology.', 'Accuracy Improvement Method Based on Characteristic Database Classification for IMRT Dose Prediction in Cervical Cancer: Scientifically Training Data Selection.', 'The feasibility study on the generalization of deep learning dose prediction model for volumetric modulated arc therapy of cervical cancer.', 'Dose Prediction Using a Three-Dimensional Convolutional Neural Network for Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma With Tomotherapy.']"""

Docetaxel is an antimicrotubule cytotoxic agent that improves survival in mCRPC. We investigated whether combining these potentially cross-sensitising agents to dually target tumour and bone would be safe and effective.  Patients and methods:   Phase 1 was a dose escalation study to define a recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of docetaxel and radium-223. In phase 2a, patients were randomised 2:1 to the recommended combination regimen or docetaxel at a dose of 75 mg/m2 every 3 weeks (q3w). Patients with bone-predominant mCRPC were eligible. End-points were safety, efficacy and treatment-related changes in serum and imaging biomarkers.  Results:   Twenty patients were enrolled in phase 1; 53 patients were randomised in phase 2a: 36 to combination treatment and 17 to docetaxel alone. The RP2D for the combination was radium-223 55 kBq/kg every six weeks × 5 doses, plus docetaxel 60 mg/m2 q3w × 10 doses. Febrile neutropenia was dose limiting. A higher rate of febrile neutropenia was seen in the docetaxel monotherapy arm (15% vs 0%); the safety profile of the treatment groups was otherwise similar. The combination arm had more durable suppression of prostate-specific antigen (median time to progression, 6.6 vs 4.8 months, respectively), alkaline phosphatase (9 vs 7 months) and osteoblastic bone deposition markers.  Conclusions:   Radium-223 in combination with docetaxel at the RP2D was well tolerated.

Prostate cancer has been shown to have a higher tissue sodium concentration (TSC) than normal tissue. Sodium (23 Na) and 13 C nuclei have a frequency difference of only 1.66 MHz at 3T, potentially enabling 23 Na imaging with a 13 C-tuned coil and maximizing the metabolic information obtained from a single study.  Purpose:   To compare TSC measurements from a 13 C-tuned endorectal coil to those quantified with a dedicated 23 Na-tuned coil.  Study type:   Prospective.  Population:   Eight patients with biopsy-proven, intermediate/high risk prostate cancer imaged prior to prostatectomy.  Sequence:   3T MRI with separate dual-tuned 1 H/23 Na and 1 H/13 C endorectal receive coils to quantify TSC.  Assessment:   Regions-of-interest for TSC quantification were defined for normal peripheral zone (PZ), normal transition zone (TZ), and tumor, with reference to histopathology maps.  Statistical tests:   Two-sided Wilcoxon rank sum with additional measures of correlation, coefficient of variation, and Bland-Altman plots to assess for between-test differences.  Results:   Mean TSC for normal PZ and TZ were 39.2 and 33.9 mM, respectively, with the 23 Na coil and 40.1 and 36.3 mM, respectively, with the 13 C coil (P = 0.22 and P = 0.11 for the intercoil comparison, respectively). For tumor tissue, there was no statistical difference between the overall mean tumor TSC measured with the 23 Na coil (41.8 mM) and with the 13 C coil (46.6 mM; P = 0.38). Bland-Altman plots showed good repeatability for tumor TSC measurements between coils, with a reproducibility coefficient of 9 mM; the coefficient of variation between the coils was 12%. The Pearson correlation coefficient for TSC between coils for all measurements was r = 0.71 (r2 = 0.51), indicating a strong positive linear relationship. The mean TSC within PZ tumors was significantly higher compared with normal PZ for both the 23 Na coil (45.4 mM; P = 0.02) and the 13 C coil (49.4 mM; P = 0.002).

Methods:   AA administered daily for ≥4 weeks concurrently with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) for mCRPC were included. Pharmacokinetic evaluation was performed at two consecutive visits at least 4 weeks apart. Plasma samples were collected 24 h after last dose of AA to obtain drug trough level (DTL) of two active metabolites, abiraterone and D4A.  Results:   39 plasma samples were obtained from 22 patients, with 17 patients had repeat DTL measurement. Considerable inter-patient variability in DTL was seen, with initial DTL for abiraterone ranging between 1.5 and 25.4 ng/ml (CV 61%) and for D4A between 0.2 and 2.5 ng/ml (CV 61%). Intra-patient variability in DTL for abiraterone varied between 0.85 and 336% and for D4A between 1.14 and 199%. There was no increase in AA exposure with use of dexamethasone (n = 5; DTL 13.9) compared with prednisone (n = 17; DTL 11.0 p = 0.5), dosing in fasted state (n = 13, DTL 12.1) compared to dosing in fed state (n = 9; DTL 11.1, p = 0.8), or chemotherapy-exposed (n = 10; DTL 8.9) compared to chemotherapy naïve (n = 12; DTL 14.0, p = 0.1).  Conclusions:   Our cohort demonstrated high inter- and intra-patient variability in both abiraterone and D4A with fixed dosing of AA, with no effect from choice of corticosteroids, prior use of chemotherapy, or dosing in fasting state.

This study presented the pathological response and oncological outcomes of male patients with cT4a urothelial bladder cancer managed with preoperative chemotherapy followed by radical cystectomy. Materials and methods: Data were collected retrospectively from male patients with cT4a urothelial bladder cancer, who underwent radical cystectomy with or without preoperative chemotherapy. Patient characteristics and pathological response were compared. The Kaplan-Meier method and multivariable Cox regression were used to analyze recurrence-free survival and overall survival. Results: From 1989 to 2016, 90 male patients with primary cT4a urothelial bladder cancer underwent radical cystectomy at the institution, 55 (61%) did not have preoperative chemotherapy and 35 (39%) had preoperative chemotherapy. The preoperative chemotherapy group had more lymphovascular invasion on primary transurethral resection of bladder tumor (31.4% vs 18.2%, p = .2) and more clinically positive nodal disease (31.4% vs 10.9%, p = .09). At radical cystectomy, the preoperative chemotherapy group had more tumor down staging (60% vs 29.1%, p = .005), less lymphovascular invasion (40% vs 54.5%, p = .05) and less positive nodal disease (25.7% vs 45.5%, p = .006). Hydronephrosis, lymphovascular invasion and age >70 were associated with worse recurrence-free survival and overall survival (p < .05). Tumor down-staging was associated with improved recurrence-free survival and overall survival (p = .003, p = .03, respectively). Preoperative chemotherapy alone was not associated with improved oncologic outcomes. Conclusions: Preoperative chemotherapy is associated with cT4a bladder cancer down-staging, decreased lymphovascular invasion and decreased positive nodal disease.

Peimine (PM) is a bioactive substance isolated from Fritillaria. Previous studies have shown that PM could inhibit the occurrence of a variety of cancers. However, the roles of PM in PC and its related mechanism have not been elucidated. Calcium (Ca2+ ) is an important intracellular messenger involved in a variety of cell processes. In this study, we found that the appropriate doses of PM (2.5, 5, and 10 μM) significantly inhibited the growth of PC cells (DU-145, LNCap, and PC-3), but has no significant effect on normal prostate cells (RWPE-1). In addition, PM treatment inhibited the invasion and migration of PC-3 cells and blocked the epithelial-mesenchymal transition process. These effects were exhibited a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, the current results also showed that PM treatment significantly increased the Ca2+ concentration, the increased Ca2+ promoted the phosphorylation of Ca2+ /calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), further inhibited the growth and invasion of PC-3 cells, and induced its apoptosis. Ca2+ chelator BAPTA-AM (1 μM) could counteract the increase of intracellular Ca2+ concentration. Similarly, JNK pathway inhibitor SP600125 (10 μM) also inhibited cell growth and invasion and induced apoptosis. In addition, experiments in nude mice showed that PM inhibited tumor formation through Ca2+ /CaMKII/JNK signaling pathway.

In addition, to identify the function of AFAP1-AS1 on prostate cancer in vitro, cell proliferation, transwell assay, and Matrigel assay were conducted. Furthermore, by performing qRT-PCR and Western blot assay, the underlying mechanism was explored.  Results:   The expression level of AFAP1-AS1 was significantly higher in prostate cancer samples than that in corresponding ones. Additionally, the cell proliferation, migration, and invasion capacities were inhibited after AFAP1-AS1 was knocked down in prostate cancer cells. Moreover, the mRNA and protein expressions of RBM5 were upregulated after AFAP1-AS1 was knocked down. Furthermore, the RBM5 expression level was negatively related to AFAP1-AS1 expression level in prostate cancer samples.

The expression of early growth response 3 (EGR3) was determined to be elevated in human PC tissues; however, the possible effects and underlying mechanism of miR‑335 on PC remains unknown. In the present study, miR‑335 mimics and miR‑335 inhibitors were respectively transfected into DU145 cells. Stable silencing of EGR3 was observed in DU145 cells following transfection with small interfering RNA. We also used Cell Counting Kit‑8 and in vitro angiogenesis assays to determine the viability and revascularization potential of DU145 cells. The expression levels of EGR and caspase‑3 activity were analyzed by immunohistochemistry and immunocytochemistry, respectively. We predicted the target of miR‑335 by bioinformatics analysis and a dual‑luciferase reporter gene assay. Western blot and quantitative real‑time polymerase chain reaction analyses were performed to determine the protein and mRNA expression of molecules. miR‑335 expression was downregulated in PC tissues and cell lines. Overexpression of miR‑335 significantly reduced the viability and the formation of regenerative tubes of DU145 cells, and inhibited the expression of inflammatory factors. EGR3 was proposed as a possible target of miR‑335, and was negatively regulated by miR‑335. Silencing EGR3 suppressed the viability and angiogenesis of DU145 cells, and reduced the activity of caspase‑3 and inflammatory factor expression. miR‑335 inhibition along with EGR3 silencing EGR3 inhibited the cell proliferation. Furthermore, miR‑335 inhibited the formation of a PC solid tumor xenograft in vivo. Thus, miR‑335 may exert an antitumor effect on DU145 cells by regulating the expression of EGR3.

Thus, the present study aimed to identify miRNAs closely related with metadherin (MTDH) and to determine their roles in PCa. For this purpose, the expression levels of MTDH in PCa tissues and cell lines were examined by RT‑qPCR, immunohistochemistry and western blot analysis. By cell transfection, MTDH was either overexpressed in the normal prostate epithelial cell lines or silenced in tumor cell lines to determine cell viability, invasion and migration. Bioinformatics analysis, RT‑qPCR, western blot analysis, dual‑luciferase reporter assay and MTT assay were performed to identify direct the target of MTDH and to examine tumor cell viability. Rescue experiments using the PC‑3 and LNCaP cells were carried out by MTT assay, scratch wound assay, Transwell assay, RT‑qPCR and western blot analysis. Experiments were also conducted using 46 PCa human cancer and adjacent tissues, as wells as on 501 cases of PCa from the TCGA database. It was confirmed that the overexpression of MTDH was associated with a poor prognosis of patients. The overexpression of MTDH was found to promote the viability, invasion and migration of PCa cells. miR‑145‑5p and miR‑145‑3p identified from 16 miRNAs were found to be closely related to PCa and to be the targets of MTDH. Both these miRNAs were found to significantly suppress the growth and metastasis of PCa cells by negatively regulating the expression of MTDH. On the whole, the findings of this study demonstrate that MTDH functions as an oncogene in PCa and the inhibition of MTDH by miR‑145‑5p or miR‑145‑3p suppressed the growth and metastasis of PCa cells.

Thus, the aim of the present study was to determine whether Cav‑1 can be used as a key molecule for the prevention and treatment of CRPC, and to explore its mechanism of action in CRPC. For this purpose, tissue and serum samples from patients with primary prostate cancer and CRPC were analyzed using immunohistochemistry and enzyme‑linked immunosorbent assay, which revealed that Cav‑1 was overexpressed in CRPC. Furthermore, Kaplan‑Meier survival analysis and univariate Cox proportional hazards regression analysis demonstrated that Cav‑1 expression in tumors was an independent risk factor for the occurrence of CRPC and was associated with a shorter recurrence‑free survival time in patients with CRPC. Receiver operating characteristic curves suggested that serum Cav‑1 could be used as a diagnostic biomarker for CRPC (area under the curve, 0.876) using a cut‑off value of 0.68 ng/ml (with a sensitivity of 82.1% and specificity of 80%). In addition, it was determined that Cav‑1 induced the invasion and migration of CRPC cells by the activation of the H‑Ras/phosphoinositide‑specific phospholipase Cε signaling cascade in the cell membrane caveolae. Importantly, simvastatin was able to augment the anticancer effects of androgen receptor antagonists by downregulating the expression of Cav‑1.

Variable testosterone (T) recovery profiles after ADT cessation have been cited.  Aim:   To evaluate T recovery after cessation of ADT.  Methods:   We reviewed our institutional prospectively maintained database of patients with prostate cancer who received ADT. Serum early morning total T (TT) levels, collected at baseline and periodically after ADT cessation, were analyzed. Patient age, baseline T level, duration of ADT, and presence of diabetes and sleep apnea were selected as potential predictors of T recovery. 3 metrics of T recovery after 24 months of ADT cessation were analyzed: return to non-castrate level (TT > 50 ng/dL), return to normal (T > 300 ng/dL), and return back to baseline level (BTB). Multivariable time-to-event analysis (Cox proportional hazards), χ2 test, logistic regression model, and Kaplan-Meier curve were performed to define impact of the above predictors on time and chance of T recovery.  Main outcome measures:   Time and chance of T recovery to non-castrate level (TT > 50 ng/dL), return to normal (T > 300 ng/dL), and return BTB.  Results:   307 men with a mean age of 65 ± 8 years were included. Mean duration of ADT was 17 ± 25 months, and median follow-up was 31 ± 35 months. Mean TT values were 379 ng/dL at baseline and 321 ng/dL at >24 months. At 24 months after cessation of ADT, 8% of men remained at castrate level, 76% returned to TT >300 ng/dL, and 51% had returned BTB. Lower baseline T levels (TT < 400 ng/dL) and ADT duration >6 months were associated with a lower likelihood of recovery to normal TT at 24 months. Age >65 years and receiving ADT for >6 months were significantly associated with a slower T recovery.  Clinical implications:   T recovery after ADT is not certain and may take longer than expected. Considering the range of side effects of low T, we believe that these findings must be discussed with patients before initiating such therapies.  Strengths & limitations:   Our strengths consisted of a relatively large database, long follow-up, and clinically meaningful endpoints. Limitations included the retrospective design of the study.  Conclusion:   T recovery rates after ADT cessation vary according to patient age, ADT duration, and baseline T levels. Approximately one-quarter of patients failed to normalize their TT level, and one-tenth of men remained at castrate levels 24 months after ADT cessation. Nascimento B, Miranda EP, Jenkins LC, et al.

Patients and methods:   Baseline data were obtained from 153 patients with CRPC treated with ARATs. Patients were stratified according to the upper limit of the normal RDW range, measured within 1 month before starting treatment. Relationships between RDW levels and the best prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response, PSA progression-free survival, and overall survival were examined.  Results:   Forty-nine patients were treated with abiraterone acetate in combination with corticosteroid and 104 with enzalutamide. The median RDW was 13.7% (interquartile range, 13.0-14.9). High RDW was significantly associated with prior use of docetaxel (P < .001), presence of lymph node metastasis (P = .031), presence of visceral metastasis (P = .001), and low hemoglobin (P < .001), low albumin (P = .016), and high C-reactive protein levels (P = .02). In a multiple linear regression model, there was a statistically significant negative association between RDW levels and the best PSA response (P = .046). In addition, multivariate Cox regression analyses showed that high RDW was an independent predictor of both shorter PSA progression-free survival (hazard ratio = 1.84; 95% confidence interval, 1.04-3.27; P = .037) and overall survival (hazard ratio = 2.62; 95% confidence interval, 1.15-5.98; P = .022), showing statistical significance.

Patients and methods:   Within the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database (2004-2015), we identified patients with histologically confirmed prostate adenocarcinoma who harbored either DC (n = 581) or acinar adenocarcinoma (n = 489,296). Kaplan-Meier and 4:1 propensity score-matched multivariable Cox regression models adjusted for clinical and pathologic parameters were used to test for CSM differences. Three separate analyses were performed on all patients with nonmetastatic disease, patients with nonmetastatic patients treated with radical prostatectomy only, and patients with metastatic disease.  Results:   DC was identified in 502 (0.10%) of 469,946 patients with nonmetastatic disease and 79 (0.39%) of 19,931 patients with metastatic disease. In patients with nonmetastatic disease, 253 (50.4%) DC patients underwent radical prostatectomy, 61 (12.2%) DC patients received external-beam radiotherapy, and 188 (37.4%) received other treatment modalities.

BMI1 overexpression downregulates the expression of tumor suppressor genes, such as p16Ink4a and PTEN. BMI1 expression is upregulated in cancer stem cells (CSCs). Therefore, inhibitors of BMI1 expression have potential as therapeutic agents for cancer. This study aimed to identify BMI1 promoter inhibitors from actinomycetes. Using a recently constructed BMI1 promoter assay, we isolated three known compounds, elaiophylin (1), 2-methylelaiophylin (2), and nocardamin (3), from Streptomyces sp. IFM-11958 that inhibited BMI1 promoter activity with IC50 values of 30 nM, 447 nM, 22 µM, respectively. Elaiophylin (1) was the most potent. Western blot and PCR analyses revealed that elaiophylin (1) inhibited BMI1 expression at the mRNA level in human prostate cancer cells (DU145). Elaiophylin (1) also inhibited the sphere-forming activity of human hepatocellular carcinoma cells (Huh7), indicating that elaiophylin (1) suppresses the self-renewal capacity of CSCs.

Herein, we show that syntaphilin (SNPH), a molecule originally identified as a negative regulator of mitochondrial dynamics in neurons, is abundantly expressed in prostate cancer. SNPH distribution in prostate cancer is spatially biphasic, with high expression at the invasive front, correlating with increased proliferative rates, as determined by Ki-67 labeling, and reduced levels in the central tumor bulk, which are further decreased in patients with distant metastases. Higher levels of SNPH are observed with increasing Gleason grade. Prostate tumors predominantly express a novel, extraneuronal isoform of SNPH that accumulates in mitochondria and maintains oxidative metabolism and tumor cell proliferation. These data suggest that SNPH is a novel marker of high Gleason grade prostate cancer, differentially expressed at the invasive front compared with the central tumor bulk, and is potentially down-regulated in metastatic disease. This biphasic pattern of expression may reflect a dual function of SNPH in controlling the balance between cell proliferation and invasion in tumors.""","""['Michael J Hwang', 'Kelly G Bryant', 'Jae H Seo', 'Qin Liu', 'Peter A Humphrey', 'Mary Ann C Melnick', 'Dario C Altieri', 'Marie E Robert']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Am J Pathol""","""['Syntaphilin controls a mitochondrial rheostat for proliferation-motility decisions in cancer.', 'Syntaphilin Ubiquitination Regulates Mitochondrial Dynamics and Tumor Cell Movements.', 'SPINK1 expression in relation to PTEN and ERG in matched primary and lymph node metastatic prostate cancer: Implications for biomarker development.', 'Biomarker discovery in urogenital cancer.', 'Teneurins: Role in Cancer and Potential Role as Diagnostic Biomarkers and Targets for Therapy.', 'm6A Methylation Regulators Are Predictive Biomarkers for Tumour Metastasis in Prostate Cancer.', 'Miro proteins and their role in mitochondrial transfer in cancer and beyond.']"""

Recently, randomized controlled trials have examined the benefit of apalutamide and enzalutamide in these patients. We sought to perform an indirect treatment comparison using a network meta-analysis approach to compare the relative efficacy and toxicity of these two agents. The primary outcome of this analysis was metastasis-free survival (MFS) while secondary outcomes were time to prostate-specific antigen progression, overall survival, and adverse events. The Bucher technique for indirect comparison was used to compare apalutamide and enzalutamide using the common placebo comparator. We found no evidence of a significant difference in MFS (hazard ratio 1.04, 95% confidence interval 0.78-1.37) between enzalutamide and apalutamide. Similarly, there were no differences for any of the secondary outcomes. While indirect comparisons cannot supplant direct comparative data, this analysis suggests that apalutamide and enzalutamide are similarly effective in delaying metastases for patients with nmCRPC. PATIENT SUMMARY: Historically, there have been few treatment options for prostate cancer patients receiving androgen deprivation therapy who have rising prostate-specific antigen levels without obvious recurrence of cancer. Recent randomized controlled trials demonstrated that treatment with enzalutamide and apalutamide delayed the development of metastatic cancer. This study demonstrates through an indirect comparison that both medications are likely to have similar efficacy and side-effect profiles.""","""['Christopher J D Wallis', 'Thenappan Chandrasekar', 'Hanan Goldberg', 'Laurence Klotz', 'Neil Fleshner', 'Raj Satkunasivam', 'Zachary Klaassen']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Eur Urol Oncol""","""['Matching-adjusted indirect treatment comparison of the efficacy of enzalutamide versus apalutamide for the treatment of nonmetastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Matching-Adjusted Indirect Comparison of the Efficacy of Apalutamide and Enzalutamide with ADT in the Treatment of Non-Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Efficacy of enzalutamide and apalutamide in the treatment of non-metastasic castration-resistant prostate cancer: Indirect comparison.', 'Management of Nonmetastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer: Recent Advances and Future Direction.', 'Comparative efficacy of second-generation androgen receptor inhibitors for treating prostate cancer: A systematic review and network meta-analysis.', 'SOX8 Knockdown Overcomes Enzalutamide Resistance in Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer by Inhibiting the Notch Signaling Pathway.', 'Matching-adjusted indirect treatment comparison of the efficacy of enzalutamide versus apalutamide for the treatment of nonmetastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Protein degradation technology: a strategic\xa0paradigm\xa0shift in drug discovery.', 'Overall survival and adverse events after treatment with darolutamide vs. apalutamide vs. enzalutamide for high-risk non-metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer: a systematic review and network meta-analysis.', 'Treatment and trials in non-metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.']"""

However, less is known about the outcomes for off-protocol selected PCa patients who opt for AS.  Objective:   To compare AS outcomes for higher-risk patients and very low-risk patients in a large cohort of patients diagnosed with PCa.  Design, setting, and participants:   Patients diagnosed with PCa between 2008 and 2015 with clinical stage ≥T1c and managed with AS at six large teaching hospitals.  Intervention:   AS included regular prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing (every 3-6 mo) and a confirmatory biopsy 1 yr after diagnosis and every 3 yr thereafter.  Outcomes measurements and statistical analysis:   Using the inclusion criteria of the PRIAS study, outcomes for PRIAS-eligible patients (ie, cT1c-T2, Gleason sum score ≤6, ≤2 positive biopsy cores, PSA ≤10 ng/ml, and PSA density <0.2 ng/ml/ml) were compared to outcomes for PRIAS-ineligible patients. Unfavourable outcomes following deferred surgery, biochemical recurrence, and risk of metastasis were calculated using univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses. Time to tumour progression was established using survival analysis.  Results and limitations:   Of the 1000 patients included and managed with AS, almost half of the patients (49%) had higher-risk disease characteristics than the PRIAS inclusion criteria. PRIAS-ineligible patients discontinued AS because of tumour progression significantly earlier than PRIAS-eligible patients (hazard ratio [HR] 1.74, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.44-2.11); they also had a higher risk of positive surgical margins (odds ratio [OR] 2.15, 95% CI 1.11-4.17) and unfavourable pathological findings (OR 3.20, 95% CI 1.61-6.35) following deferred radical prostatectomy. PSA density ≥0.2 ng/ml/ml was the most important individual predictor and, in addition to a higher risk of tumour progression and unfavourable surgical outcomes, was also associated with a significantly higher risk of biochemical progression following deferred radical prostatectomy (OR 3.26, 95% CI 1.23-8.64). In the overall population, PSA density ≥0.2 ng/ml/ml was also associated with a higher risk of metastasis (HR 2.71, 95% CI 1.23-5.96).  Conclusions:   In this cohort, approximately half of the patients did not meet the inclusion criteria of the PRIAS study. These patients had a two- to threefold higher risk of disease progression and unfavourable outcomes following deferred prostatectomy. PSA density is an important individual predictor of unfavourable outcomes and should be taken into account when selecting patients for AS.  Patient summary:   A large proportion of patients with prostate cancer on active surveillance are not in the lowest risk group. These patients have a higher risk of experiencing tumour progression to a stage requiring curative intervention. They also have worse disease prognosis compared to patients on active surveillance in the lowest risk group.""","""['Timo F W Soeterik', 'Harm H E van Melick', 'Lea M Dijksman', 'Douwe H Biesma', 'J Alfred Witjes', 'Jean-Paul A van Basten']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Eur Urol Oncol""","""['Follow-up in Active Surveillance for Prostate Cancer: Strict Protocol Adherence Remains Important for PRIAS-ineligible Patients.', 'Pathological and biochemical outcomes after radical prostatectomy in men with low-risk prostate cancer meeting the Prostate Cancer International: Active Surveillance criteria.', 'Outcomes of initially expectantly managed patients with low or intermediate risk screen-detected localized prostate cancer.', 'Management of localised prostate cancer: watchful waiting, surgery or radiation therapy, depending on the natural course, which is often relatively slow.', 'An evidence review of active surveillance in men with localized prostate cancer.', 'Value of machine learning-based transrectal multimodal ultrasound combined with PSA-related indicators in the diagnosis of clinically significant prostate cancer.', 'Active surveillance in renal transplant patients with prostate cancer: a multicentre analysis.', 'Knowledge, attitudes, and practices of active surveillance in prostate cancer among urologists: a real-life survey from Brazil.', 'Localised prostate cancer: radical prostatectomy or deferred treatment strategy.']"""

Objective:   To test treatment rate differences between AA and Caucasian patients with clinically localized PCa, with and without adjustment for other-cause mortality (OCM).  Design, setting, and participants:   Within the Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) database (2004-2014), we identified 260 309 (94.0%) Caucasian and 15 534 (6.0%) AA patients with PCa.  Intervention:   Radical prostatectomy (RP), external beam radiotherapy (EBRT), brachytherapy (BT), combination of BT and EBRT (BT+EBRT), or nonlocal treatment (NLT).  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   We used multivariable logistic regression to assess treatment rates according to race, with or without adjustment for OCM risk according to D'Amico risk classification. OCM was defined using a multivariable Cox regression model, developed using a 50% random sample and validated using the remaining 50%.  Results and limitations:   Before OCM adjustment, AA patients were less likely to receive RP regardless of D'Amico risk (odds ratio [OR] 0.54 for low risk [LR], 0.45 for intermediate risk [IR], and 0.43 for high risk [HR]) and were less likely to receive BT if D'Amico intermediate risk (OR 0.84) or high risk (OR 0.89). After OCM risk adjustment, AA men were still less likely to receive BT (OR 0.53 for LR, 0.32 for IR, 0.22 for HR) and EBRT (OR 0.74 for LR, 0.69 for IR, 0.83 for HR), but were no longer less likely to receive RP (OR 2.58 for LR, 3.07 for IR, 2.67 for HR) regardless of their D'Amico risk classification. The Cox model of OCM risk was 74.9% accurate in the validation cohort.  Conclusions:   For AA men, rates of treatment for localized PCa depend on OCM risk.

Current EAU guidelines reserve the use of multiparametric MRI to target or guide any repeat biopsy (mpMRI-Bx). It remains uncertain if TRUS-Bx is effective as a first strategy in terms of costs, diagnostic performance, time to diagnosis, and triage for individualised therapy.  Objective:   To determine the diagnostic and treatment costs and the effectiveness of pathways incorporating mpMRI-Bx compared to TRUS-Bx in men at high risk of PCa.  Design, setting, and participants:   A cost and time analysis was performed using data from a randomised single-centre study of 1140 patients (prostate-specific antigen >4ng/ml) divided into two groups: 570 patients underwent an initial TRUS-Bx and 570 underwent 3-T mpMRI-Bx.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Budget analyses were used to compare the diagnostic strategies using reimbursement data from the Italian National Health Security system. Analyses of reimbursable diagnostic and treatment costs were undertaken separately. Histologic outcomes, pathway diagnostic accuracy, therapy choices, and time to diagnosis were compared.  Results and limitations:   The cumulative diagnosis costs were 14.6% greater for the mpMRI-Bx pathway than for the TRUS strategy, and 5.2-6.0% higher for therapy. Diagnostic costs were €228 946 for mpMRI-Bx and €199 750 for TRUS-Bx, and the corresponding therapy costs were €1 912 000 and €1 802 800. The mpMRI-Bx strategy was highly effective in excluding clinically significant disease (Gleason ≥7; sensitivity and negative predictive value both 100%, 95% confidence interval 98-100%). The time to diagnosis was significantly shorter for the mpMRI-Bx (median 4.0 mo interquartile range [IQR] 3-6) than for the TRUS-Bx strategy (median 6 mo, IQR 4-12; p<0.001). Limitations include the lack of data on costs associated with treatment-related complications and follow-up data.  Conclusions:   The mpMRI-Bx strategy is effective for diagnosing patients with a clinical suspicion of PCa and provides more accurate diagnosis, with combined diagnosis and therapy costs only moderately higher than for the standard strategy.  Patient summary:   It is a matter of debate whether a diagnostic pathway that incorporates multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as the first-line test before performing any type of biopsy in men suspected of having prostate cancer (PCa) is cost-effective.

Objective:   To evaluate pain, discomfort and other non-infectious complications in PCa patients undergoing either systematic 12-core transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsy (SBx) or FBx and patient willingness to undergo rebiopsy.  Design, setting, and participants:   A prospective trial of 262 male patients, 203 of whom underwent transrectal SBx and 59 FBx at Helsinki University Hospital in 2015-2016. Patients completed two questionnaires immediately after and at 30 d after biopsy.  Outcome measurements and statistical analyses:   Patients reported pain and discomfort on a numeric rating scale (NRS; 0-10) immediately after biopsy. At 30 d, discomfort was measured on a scale ranging from 1 (no inconvenience) to 4 (maximal inconvenience). Other symptoms were reported dichotomously (yes/no) in both questionnaires. Mann-Whitney U, Pearson's χ2, and logistic regression tests were used.  Results and limitations:   For the SBx and FBx groups the median number of cores per patient was 12 and three, respectively. At 30 d, a higher proportion of patients in the SBx group had experienced pain than in the FBx group (70/203 [34%] vs 12/59 [20%]; p=0.043), whereas there was no difference in the median discomfort scores. Hematuria was less common in the FBx group (26/59 [44%] vs 140/203 [69%]; p<0.001). Patients willing to undergo rebiopsy immediately post-biopsy reported lower median NRS (3.0 [interquartile range 2.0-5.0] vs 5.0 [4.3-6.0]; p<0.001) and discomfort scores (4.0 [2.0-6.0] vs 7.0 [5.0-8.0]; p<0.001) than those unwilling. At 30 d, less discomfort (2.0 [interquartile range 1.0-2.0] vs 2.0 [2.0-3.0]; p=0.008) and fever (6/195 [3.1%] vs 6/28 [22%]; p=0.001) were experienced by patients willing to undergo rebiopsy. The nonrandomized design was a limitation.  Conclusions:   FBx is associated with less pain and hematuria than SBx during the 30-d interval after biopsy.  Patient summary:   Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-targeted prostate biopsy is associated with less pain, discomfort, and blood in the urine compared to the standard ultrasound-guided procedure. Performing MRI-targeted procedures may reduce biopsy-related complications and promote adherence to recommended repeat biopsy for patients on active surveillance for prostate cancer.""","""['Juho T Eineluoto', 'Petrus Järvinen', 'Tuomas Kilpeläinen', 'Kanerva Lahdensuo', 'Inari Kalalahti', 'Kevin Sandeman', 'Tuomas Mirtti', 'Antti Rannikko']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Eur Urol Oncol""","""['The prostate cancer prevention trial risk calculator 2.0 performs equally for standard biopsy and MRI/US fusion-guided biopsy.', 'Fusion prostate biopsy outperforms 12-core systematic prostate biopsy in patients with prior negative systematic biopsy: A multi-institutional analysis.', 'Assessment of Discomfort and Pain in Patients Undergoing Fusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging-guided vs TRUS-guided Prostate Biopsy.', 'Techniques and Outcomes of MRI-TRUS Fusion Prostate Biopsy.', 'Prostate Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Magnetic Resonance Imaging Targeted Biopsy in Patients with a Prior Negative Biopsy: A Consensus Statement by AUA and SAR.', 'Assessing the need for systematic biopsies in addition to targeted biopsies according to the characteristics of the index lesion at mpMRI.

Patients and methods:   The study included 124 men who underwent mpMRI prior to radical prostatectomy at our centre. Preoperative mpMRI, prostatectomy histology and clinical follow-up details were reviewed retrospectively. The diagnostic value of mpMRI was evaluated on the basis of the detection rate. Secondly, the prognostic significance of CA/IDC among grade group (GG)2 cancers with regard to biochemical recurrence (BCR)-free survival was assessed using Kaplan-Meier analysis, with the log rank test and Fisher's exact test.  Results:   Pathological examination of radical prostatectomy specimens identified CA/IDC in 89 of 124 cases (71%) and mpMRI identified 86/95 of tumours including any CA/IDC with a sensitivity of 90.5% (95% confidence interval 82.8-95.6%). When localization of the lesions was compared, there was an association between the highest Prostate Imaging-Reporting and Data System classification and the highest pathological grade in 106 of the 124 cases (85.5%). In patients with GG2 lesions, BCR occurred in 11 of 31 (35.5%) with CA/IDC and two of 21 (9.5%) without CA/IDC (P = 0.034).

Poly(adenosine diphosphate [ADP]-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors have recently been found to be remarkably toxic to cells with defects in homologous recombination, particularly cells with BRCA-mutated backgrounds. Therefore, this preliminary study was designed to evaluate whether PTEN expression status could have an impact on the sensitivity of invasive Pca cells to the PARP inhibitor, AZD2461.  Methods:   MTT viability test, Annexin V‐FITC/propidium iodide double staining, and caspase3 activity assay were used to evaluate the apoptosis and relative expression of PTEN and VEGF in PC-3 and DU145 cell lines using real-time PCR.  Results:   MTT results showed that the inhibitory effects of AZD2461 were higher in PC-3 than DU145 cells (with IC50 of 36.48 and 59.03 µM at 48 hours of treatment, respectively). Flow cytometric analysis also showed the same results. When exposed to 40 µM of AZD2461, PC-3 (38.8%) and DU145 (28%) cells underwent apoptosis (p < 0.05). Treatment of cells by AZD2461 also caused a significant increase in apoptosis through caspase3 activation in both cell lines. VEGF mRNA levels in PC-3 cells significantly decreased compared to adjusted untreated cells (p < 0.05) in all measured times while displaying different alteration patterns in DU145 cells (p < 0.05).

Here we report on our experience with a series of 73 castration-resistant prostate carcinoma patients treated with 225Ac-PSMA-617, identifying variables predictive for overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) after 225Ac-PSMA-617 treatment. Methods:225Ac-PSMA-617 was administered to patients who had metastatic castration-resistant prostate carcinoma and who had exhausted available therapy options for their disease. Full blood count, glomerular filtration rate, and liver function test were obtained at baseline and on follow-up for evaluation of toxicity. 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT was obtained at baseline, before every treatment cycle, and on follow-up for selection of patients for treatment, to determine the activity of the treatment agent to be administered, and for response assessment. Serial prostate-specific antigen (PSA) was obtained for PSA response assessment. Results: Seventy-three men (mean age, 69 y; range, 45-85 y) with metastatic castration-resistant prostate carcinoma were treated with 210 cycles of 225Ac-PSMA-617. In 70% of patients, a PSA decline of greater than or equal to 50% was obtained; 82% of patients had any PSA decline. In 29% of patients, all lesions on 68Ga-PSMA PET resolved in response to treatment. During follow-up, 23 patients experienced disease progression, whereas 13 patients died from their disease. The estimated median PFS and OS were 15.2 mo (95% CI, 13.1-17.4) and 18 mo (95% CI, 16.2-19.9), respectively. In univariate analyses, factors such as baseline PSA, any PSA decline, PSA decline of greater than or equal to 50%, prior chemotherapy, prior radiation therapy, and baseline hemoglobin level were associated with longer PFS and OS (all Ps < 0.05). In multivariate analyses, there was a negative association between prior 177Lu-PSMA therapy and PFS, and a positive association between PSA decline of greater or equal to 50% and PFS. Only a PSA decline of greater than or equal to 50% remained significantly associated with OS on multivariate analyses. Xerostomia was seen in 85% of patients but was not severe enough to warrant discontinuing treatment. Anemia was seen in 27 patients; no patients had grade IV bone marrow toxicity. Renal failure of grade III or IV was seen in 5 patients with baseline renal impairment. Conclusion: In this study, a PSA decline of greater than or equal to 50% after treatment with 225Ac-PSMA-617 was proven by multivariate analyses to be significantly associated with OS and PFS.

Few population-based studies have examined the impact of particular visceral metastatic sites on MPC survival outcomes. We investigated this using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database.  Materials and methods:   We analyzed the overall survival (OS) and prostate cancer mortality (PCM) risk of 12,180 patients, from SEER 18 registries, diagnosed with MPC from 2010 to 2014. We identified those with metastatic disease in bone, brain, liver, and lung. Kaplan-Meier analyses, competing risks regression, and Cox proportional hazards models were used to assess the impact of visceral metastatic disease sites on OS and PCM.  Results:   Most patients were coded as having metastatic disease in the bone without disease in the brain, liver, or lung (bone group, n = 10,620; 87% of total). On Cox multivariable regression analysis, patients with lung metastases, with or without bone metastases, did not differ significantly from patients in the bone group with respect to OS (hazard ratio, 0.82; 95% confidence interval, 0.63-1.06; P = .13 and hazard ratio, 1.12; 95% confidence interval, 0.98-1.28; P = .10, respectively). These patients also did not differ from the bone group with respect to PCM incidence on competing risks regression analysis.  Conclusions:   This study suggests that patients with MPC confined to bone and/or lung may have improved survival relative to those with MPC affecting other visceral sites. Although it was anticipated that patients with bone metastases would represent a favorable subgroup, the favorable outcomes in patents with lung metastases (with or without bone metastases) was unexpected. These findings may inform future therapeutic investigations to improve the prognosis of patients with MPC.""","""['Justin Budnik', 'Jaipreet Suri', 'James E Bates', 'Kevin C Bylund', 'Michael T Milano']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Clin Genitourin Cancer""","""['The prognosis of different distant metastases pattern in prostate cancer: A population based retrospective study.', 'The risk and prognostic factors for brain metastases in esophageal cancer patients: an analysis of the SEER database.', 'Metastatic patterns and survival outcomes in patients with stage IV colon cancer: A population-based analysis.', 'Improvement of survival and prospect of cure in patients with metastatic breast cancer.', 'Epidemiology of brain metastases and leptomeningeal disease.', 'An Interesting Case of Prostate Cancer Presenting With Colonic Metastasis.', 'Identification and Validation of the Prognostic Impact of Metastatic Prostate Cancer Phenotypes.', 'Development and validation of a nomogram to predict survival in patients with metastatic testicular germ cell tumors.', 'Narrative review of urinary glycan biomarkers in prostate cancer.', 'Evolving Natural History of Metastatic Prostate Cancer.']"""

We investigate the feasibility of a universal set of objectives and constraints for VMAT plans in different anatomical sites and the impact of involving the Physician in the navigation of the generated Pareto plans. We randomly selected 20 prostate only, 14 whole pelvis, 10 advanced lung, 15 pancreas, and 7 head and neck plans planned with a VMAT technique. Using the clinically delivered isocenter and beam set-up, we retrospectively generated MCO plans with a universal set of constraints and objectives for each anatomical site. The MCO plan scores were compared with clinical plans or an independent plan generated with DMPO. For prostate only plans the TCP values for the clinical and MCO plans were similar and the rectum NTCP values and overall P+ were slightly better for the MCO plans. For whole pelvis, the resulting MCO plans were comparable in all the dosimetric measures to the clinical plans. For lung, the MCO dosimetric comparison also yielded comparable plans but when evaluating individual patients, there were 5 patients for which MCO plans had a clear advantage in reducing dose to lung and/or esophagus while improving/maintaining target coverage, 4 patients with comparable plans and 1 patient where MCO was worse. Allowing the physician to navigate independently produced a different selection of dosimetric trade-offs. Comparable MCO plans were also obtained for pancreas and head and neck.

This targeted, α-particle-emitting therapy has demonstrated significant survival benefit accompanied by a favorable safety profile. Nevertheless, recent evidence suggests that its combined use with abiraterone and prednisone/prednisolone may be associated with increased risk of death and fractures. While the precise pathophysiologic mechanisms of these events are not yet clear, collecting evidence from more clinical trials and translational studies is necessary. The aim of our present study is to assess whether accessible sources of patient outcome data can help gain additional clinical insights to radium-223 dichloride's safety profile. Materials and Methods: We performed a retrospective analysis of cases extracted from the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System and characterized side effect occurrence by using reporting ratios. Results: A total of ~1500 prostate cancer patients treated with radium-223 dichloride was identified, and side effects reported with the use of radium-223 dichloride alone or in combination with other therapeutic agents were extracted. Our analysis demonstrates that radium-223 dichloride may often come with hematological-related reactions, and that, when administered together with other drugs, its safety profile may differ. Conclusions: While more prospective studies are needed to fully characterize the toxicological profile of radium-223 dichloride, the present work constitutes perhaps the first effort to examine its safety when administered alone and in combination with other agents based on computational evidence from public real-world post marketing data.""","""['Theodoros G Soldatos', 'Ioannis Iakovou', 'Christos Sachpekidis']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Medicina (Kaunas)""","""['Radium Ra 223 dichloride in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Radium-223 dichloride: a review of its use in patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer with symptomatic bone metastases.', 'Radium 223 dichloride for prostate cancer treatment.', 'Radium-223 dichloride: a novel treatment option for castration-resistant prostate cancer patients with symptomatic bone metastases.', 'Radium-223 dichloride for the treatment of bone metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer: an evaluation of its safety.', 'Bone Health Management in the Continuum of Prostate Cancer Disease.', 'Application of a patient-centered reverse translational systems-based approach to understand mechanisms of an adverse drug reaction of immune checkpoint inhibitors.', 'Advancing drug safety science by integrating molecular knowledge with post-marketing adverse event reports.', 'A case study of a patient-centered reverse translational systems-based approach to understand adverse event profiles in drug development.', 'Public Adverse Event Data Insights into the Safety of Pembrolizumab in Melanoma Patients.']"""

This drug inhibits 5α-reductase type 2, which is why finasteride affects androgen homeostasis, since testosterone (T) cannot be reduced to dihydrotestosterone (DHT). As studies on sex-related renal injuries suggest a high probability of androgen-induced renal dysfunction, the aim of this study was to determine the potential harmful effects of finasteride on the kidneys of rats. The study was performed on sexually mature male Wistar rats given finasteride. Histological sections of the kidneys were used for immunohistochemical visualization of the androgen receptor (AR), junctional proteins (occluding (Occ); E-cad, N-cad, E-/N-cadherin; β-cat, β-catenin; connexin 43 (Cx43)), proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), IL-6, and lymphocyte markers (CD3 for T cell, CD19 for B cell). The TUNEL method was used for cell apoptosis identification, and picro sirius red staining was used to assess collagen fibers thickness. The levels of T, DHT and estradiol (E2) were determined in blood serum. It was shown that finasteride treatment affected steroid hormone homeostasis, altered the expression of AR and intracellular junction proteins, changed the ratio between cell apoptosis and proliferation, and caused lymphocyte infiltration and an increase of IL-6. The thickening of collagen fibers was observed as tubular fibrosis and glomerulosclerosis. Summarizing, finasteride-induced hormonal imbalance impaired the morphology (i.e., dysplastic glomeruli, swollen proximal convoluted tubules) and physiology (changed level of detected proteins/markers expression) of the kidneys. Therefore, it is suggested that patients with renal dysfunction or following renal transplantation, with androgen or antiandrogen supplementation, should be under special control and covered by extended diagnostics, because the adverse negative effect of DHT deficiency on the progression of kidney disease cannot be ignored.""","""['Mirza Saim Baig', 'Agnieszka Kolasa-Wołosiuk', 'Anna Pilutin', 'Krzysztof Safranow', 'Irena Baranowska-Bosiacka', 'Joanna Kabat-Koperska', 'Barbara Wiszniewska']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Int J Environ Res Public Health""","""['Dihydrotestosterone and the concept of 5alpha-reductase inhibition in human benign prostatic hyperplasia.', 'Inhibition of 5alpha-reductase in rat prostate reveals differential regulation of androgen-response gene expression by testosterone and dihydrotestosterone.', 'Dihydrotestosterone and the concept of 5alpha-reductase inhibition in human benign prostatic hyperplasia.', 'Comparison of the pharmacological effects of a novel selective androgen receptor modulator, the 5alpha-reductase inhibitor finasteride, and the antiandrogen hydroxyflutamide in intact rats: new approach for benign prostate hyperplasia.', 'Differential effect of finasteride on the tissue androgen concentrations in benign prostatic hyperplasia.', 'Transcutaneous application of ultrasound enhances the effects of finasteride in a murine model of androgenic alopecia.', 'Inhibitory Effect of Astaxanthin on Testosterone-Induced Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia in Rats.', 'Does treatment with dutasteride or finasteride has impact on renal morphology?

When CB is performed with fine needle aspiration (FNA), the CB may be interpreted by a cytopathologist or gastrointestinal pathologist.  Objective:   This study compares interpretation of liver mass biopsy between cytopathologist and gastrointestinal pathologist in the era of subspecialty practice.  Design:   349 liver mass lesions with FNA and CB performed during a 5-year period were retrieved. All cases were initially interpreted by a cytopathologist and retrospectively reviewed by a gastrointestinal pathologist.  Results:   The overall agreement was 95.1% (332/349 cases). There was agreement on 57/65 non-neoplastic cases (87.7%) with 8 (12.3%) discordant cases including 4 steatosis (steatohepatitis missed in 3 cases, 1 re-interpreted as focal nodular hyperplasia [FNH]); 3 inflammation (1 necrotizing granulomatous inflammation, 1 massive necrosis instead of fibrosing cholestatic hepatitis, and 1 hepatocellular carcinoma [HCC] was missed); and 1 initially deemed normal re-interpreted as FNH. There was agreement on 275/284 neoplastic cases (96.8%), with 9 (3.2%) discordant cases including: 2 initially interpreted as HCC (1 metastatic adrenal cortical carcinoma, 1 cholangiocarcinoma); 3 adenocarcinomas (2 further defined as prostatic primary, 1 well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumor [WDNET]); 2 metastatic carcinomas (1 tumor-induced fibrosis instead of cirrhosis, 1 LCNEC re-interpreted as WDNET); 1 poorly differentiated carcinoma (re-interpreted as LCNEC); and 1 sarcomatoid carcinoma (re-interpreted as leiomyosarcoma).

LNCaP human prostate cancer cells express only GHR. A soluble fragment of IGF-1 receptor (IGF-1R) extracellular domain (sol IGF-1R) interacts with GHR and blocks GH signaling. We now explore sol IGF-1R's specificity for inhibiting GH signaling via GHR vs. PRLR and test GHR and PRLR extracellular domain inhibition determinants. Although T47D human breast cancer cells express GHR and PRLR, GH signaling is largely PRLR-mediated. In T47D, sol IGF-1R inhibited neither GH- nor PRL-induced STAT5 activation. However, sol IGF-1R inhibited GH-induced STAT5 activation in T47D-shPRLR cells, which harbor reduced PRLR. In MIN6 mouse β-cells, bovine GH (bGH) activates mouse GHR, not PRLR, while human GH activates mouse GHR and PRLR. In MIN6, sol IGF-1R inhibited bGH-induced STAT5 activation, but partially inhibited human GH-induced STAT5 activation. These findings suggest sol IGF-1R's inhibition is GHR-specific. Using a cellular reconstitution system, we compared effects of sol IGF-1R on signaling through GHR, PRLR, or chimeras in which extracellular subdomains 2 (S2) of the receptors were swapped. Sol IGF-1R inhibited GH-induced STAT5 activation in GHR-expressing, not PRLR-expressing cells, consistent with GHR specificity of sol IGF-1R. Interestingly, we found that GHR S2 (which harbors the GHR-GHR dimer interface) was required, but not sufficient for sol IGF-1R inhibition of GHR signaling. These results suggest sol IGF-1R specifically inhibits GH-induced GHR-mediated signaling, possibly through interaction with GHR S1 and S2 domains. Our findings have implications for GH antagonist development.""","""['Yue Zhang', 'Sajina Gc', 'Sweta B Patel', 'Ying Liu', 'Andrew J Paterson', 'John C Kappes', 'Jing Jiang', 'Stuart J Frank']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Mol Cell Endocrinol""","""['Human GH receptor-IGF-1 receptor interaction: implications for GH signaling.', 'The role of prolactin receptor in GH signaling in breast cancer cells.', 'Growth hormone signaling in human T47D breast cancer cells: potential role for a growth hormone receptor-prolactin receptor complex.', 'The role of prolactin and growth hormone in breast cancer.', 'Growth hormone (GH) binding and effects of GH analogs in transgenic mice.', 'Chemotherapy of Capecitabine plus Temozolomide for Refractory Pituitary Adenoma after Tumor Resection and Its Impact on Serum Prolactin, IGF-1, and Growth Hormone.', 'Second-Generation Jak2 Inhibitors for Advanced Prostate Cancer: Are We Ready for Clinical Development?', 'Dual Characters of GH-IGF1 Signaling Pathways in Radiotherapy and Post-radiotherapy Repair of Cancers.', 'Classical and novel GH receptor signaling pathways.', 'Growth hormone receptor promotes breast cancer progression via the BRAF/MEK/ERK signaling pathway.']"""

A useful cell model for analysis of the molecular mechanism of PCa progression is required for developing targeted therapies toward CR PCa. In this study, we established a PCa cell progressive model in three separate cell lines, of which androgen-independent (AI) cells were derived from respective androgen-sensitive (AS) cells. Those AI PCa cells obtain the biochemical properties of the clinical CR phenotype, including AR and PSA expression as well as enhanced proliferation and tumorigenicity under androgen-deprived conditions. Thus, those AI cells recapitulate CR PCa and exhibit increased oxidant species levels as well as enhanced signaling of proliferation and survival pathways. H2O2 treatment directly enhanced AS cell growth and migration, which was counteracted by antioxidant N-acetyl cysteine (NAC). We further identified p66Shc protein enhances the production of oxidant species which contributes to phenotypic and cell signaling alterations from AS to AI PCa cells. H2O2-treated LNCaP-AS cells had a similar signaling profile to that of LNCaP-AI or p66Shc subclone cells. Conversely, the oxidant species-driven alterations of LNCaP-AI and p66Shc subclone cell signaling is mitigated by p66Shc knockdown. Moreover, LNCaP-AI cells and p66Shc subclones, but not LNCaP-AS cells, develop xenograft tumors with metastatic nodules, correlating with p66Shc protein levels.

Objective:   To examine the rates of NDSM and DSM among patients with surgically treated nmRPS.  Design, setting and participants:   We used the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) database (2004-2014) to obtain data for patients with surgically treated nonmetastatic RPS.  Outcome measurements and statistical analyses:   The 5-yr DSM and NDSM rates were generated via competing risks regression (CRR) methodologies. Multivariable CRR models were used to test the effects of age, histologic subtype, grade, size, and radiotherapy (RT) status on NDSM and DSM.  Results and limitations:   Overall, 231 (26.8%) and 57 patients (6.7%) died from DSM and NDSM, respectively. Following stratification according to age, histologic subtype, grade, size, and RT status, the proportion of patients who succumbed to NDSM was higher for patients with age above the median, liposarcoma histologic subtype, low grade, and tumor size ≥17cm. DSM rates were also higher among patients with age above the median, leiomyosarcoma histologic subtype, high grade, and tumor size ≥17cm. Multivariable CRR models revealed that age above the median was associated with higher NDSM (hazard ratio [HR]1.7, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.1-2.7; p=0.019). Conversely, leiomyosarcoma (HR 1.9, 95% CI 1.4-2.6; p<0.0001), sarcoma not otherwise specified (HR 2.4, 95% CI 1.5-3.8; p<0.0001) and other RPS (HR 2, 95% CI 1.2-3.4; p=0.01) histologic subtypes, high grade (HR 3, 95% CI 2.3-4; p<0.0001), and tumor size above the median (HR 1.4, 95% CI 1.1-3.8; p=0.012) were associated with higher DSM. This is a retrospective study and misclassification bias may be present because of the reliability of the distinction between DSM and NDSM.  Conclusions:   The impact of NDSM in surgically treated nmRPS is not trivial, particularly among patients with favorable characteristics such as liposarcoma histologic subtype and low-grade tumors.  Patient summary:   Mortality from causes not related to the specific disease is important in patients with retroperitoneal sarcoma (RPS) treated surgically. In particular, patients with good tumor characteristics, namely liposarcoma histologic subtype and low grade, most often do not die from their cancer but succumb to causes other than RPS. Unfortunately, tumor characteristics and radiotherapy administration shed relatively little light on predicting mortality from causes other than cancer in patients with surgically treated RPS. Our report compares the risk of dying from RPS with that of dying from other causes according to the type of surgically treated sarcoma.""","""['Sebastiano Nazzani', 'Felix Preisser', 'Marco Bandini', 'Michele Marchioni', 'Zhe Tian', 'Denis Soulières', 'Emanuele Montanari', 'Dario Ratti', 'Pietro Acquati', 'Alberto Briganti', 'Shahrokh F Shariat', 'Firas Abdollah', 'Luca Carmignani', 'Pierre I Karakiewicz']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Eur Urol Oncol""","""['A contemporary analysis of radiotherapy effect in surgically treated retroperitoneal sarcoma.', 'The Benefit of Adjuvant Radiotherapy in High-grade Nonmetastatic Retroperitoneal Soft Tissue Sarcoma: A SEER Analysis.', 'Effect of intraoperative radiotherapy in the treatment of retroperitoneal sarcoma.', 'Contemporary reappraisal of the efficacy of adjuvant chemotherapy in resected retroperitoneal sarcoma: Evidence from a nationwide clinical oncology database and review of the literature.', 'Neoadjuvant radiotherapy for retroperitoneal sarcoma: A systematic review.', 'A competing risk-based nomogram to predict cancer-specific survival in patients with retroperitoneal leiomyosarcoma.', 'The prognostic factors of primary colorectal sarcoma and the clinical outcomes of negative lymph node dissection.']"""

Design, setting, and participants:   Within the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results database (2004-2014) we identified 12 939 patients newly diagnosed with mPCa.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   We used LOWESS to plot the annual trends for age, PSA (<50, 50-98, and >98ng/ml), clinical T stage (T1, T2, and T3-4), biopsy Gleason score ([GS] ≤6, 7, and 8-10), and M1a, M1b, and M1c substages. Multivariable logistic regression was used to test the effect of more contemporary year of diagnosis (YOD; 2014) on PSA, cT stage, GS, and M substage distributions. Multivariable linear regression was used to test the effect of more contemporary YOD on patient age.  Results and limitations:   Between 2004 and 2014, the age-adjusted incidence of newly diagnosed mPCa increased from 1.9 to 2.4 cases per 100 000 population (odds ratio [OR] 1.30, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.18-1.44; p<0.0001).

Design, setting, and participants:   A retrospective multi-institutional study included 547 consecutive men with lymph node-negative PC receiving SRT from 1985 to 2013. The median follow-up after SRT was 8.4 yr. Intervention All men received SRT with three-dimensional or intensity-modulated RT.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   BCR was defined as a rise in prostate-specific antigen (PSA) ≥0.2ng/ml above the PSA nadir followed by a sequentially equal or higher value. Additional outcomes included distant metastasis (DM), PC-specific mortality (PCSM), and overall mortality (OM). Cox proportional hazards models, a landmark analysis, and comparison of c-indices were used. Cumulative incidence curves were estimated from a Fine and Gray regression model.  Results and limitations:   The estimated 10-yr cumulative incidence of BCR was 60%. Of the 274 men experiencing BCR, 149 (54%) had BCR within 18 mo of SRT.

Conclusions:   A strikingly large proportion of men experience early BCR following SRT and are at higher risk of DM and PCSM. Novel predictive biomarkers are needed to identify men harboring micrometastatic disease to avoid potentially futile local therapies or allow for intensification of systemic therapies.

Results:   In Kaplan Meier analyses, patients in the CCLO high-risk group experienced significantly shorter event-free survival for all outcomes (PBD, GU, and adverse RP findings; all p<0.002). In multivariable Cox regression analysis, patients in the CCLO high-risk group had a significantly higher risk of experiencing PBD (hazard ratio [HR] 12.15, 95% confidence interval [CI] 6.18-23.9; p<0.001), GU (HR 6.01, 95% CI 2.16-16.8; p=0.002), and adverse RP findings (HR 9.144, 95% CI 2.27-36.9; p=0.006). In receiver operating characteristic analyses, the area under the curve for CCLO outperformed the number of cancer-positive Bxs in confirmatory Bx in predicting PBD (0.734 vs 0.682), GU (0.655 vs 0.576) and adverse RP findings (0.662 vs 0.561) and the added value was supported by decision curve analysis.  Conclusions:   CCLO is distinct from the number of positive Bx cores. Higher CCLO predicts AS outcomes and may aid in selection of patients for AS.  Patient summary:   For patients on active surveillance for prostate cancer, the cumulative number of cancer-positive locations in diagnostic and confirmatory biopsies is a predictor of active surveillance outcomes.""","""['Andrew M Erickson', 'Stefano Luzzago', 'Axel Semjonow', 'Hanna Vasarainen', 'Teemu D Laajala', 'Gennaro Musi', 'Ottavio de Cobelli', 'Tuomas Mirtti', 'Antti Rannikko']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Eur Urol Oncol""","""['Impact of Tumor Regional Involvement on Active Surveillance Outcomes: Validation of the Cumulative Cancer Location Metric in a US Population.', 'PTEN Loss but Not ERG Expression in Diagnostic Biopsies Is Associated with Increased Risk of Progression and Adverse Surgical Findings in Men with Prostate Cancer on Active Surveillance.', 'Effects of Initial Gleason Grade on Outcomes during Active Surveillance for Prostate Cancer.', 'Multiparametric MRI in detection and staging of prostate cancer.', 'Outcomes of Grade Group 2 and 3 Prostate Cancer on Initial Versus Confirmatory Biopsy: Implications for Active Surveillance.', 'A novel predictor of clinical progression in patients on active surveillance for prostate cancer.']"""

Objective:   To determine the utility of concurrent systematic biopsy with ROI biopsy in detecting clinically significant prostate cancer (CSPC).  Design, setting, and participants:   Retrospective study of 240 men who underwent FBx with the Artemis platform. Software captured biopsy distribution maps. Biopsy distribution maps were reviewed to determine which systematic cores overlapped with the ROI. Histopathology for overlapping systematic cores were reclassified as ROI cores.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Detection of CSPC on true systematic biopsy was the outcome measured. Multivariable logistic regression was used to determine if age, prostate-specific antigen, prostate volume, prior biopsy status, and Prostate Imaging-Reporting and Data System categorization were associated with CSPC detection and Gleason grade upgrading on systematic biopsy.  Results and limitations:   The median number of systematic cores overlapping with ROIs was 2 (interquartile range 1-2). After accounting for overlap, 14 men (5.8%) had a higher Gleason grade on systematic biopsy. Of these, seven (2.9%) were upgraded from benign and three (1.3%) from clinically insignificant cancer on systematic biopsy. In adjusted analysis, prior negative biopsy (odds ratio [OR] 0.46, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.21-0.99; p=0.046) was associated with absence of CSPC on systematic biopsy, while age (OR 1.11, 95% CI 1.02-1.21; p=0.015) was associated with upgrading. Limitations include the retrospective data and the use of a single biopsy platform.  Conclusions:   Detection of CSPC on systematic biopsy that might influence clinical decision-making is uncommon in men undergoing FBx. In men with a prior negative biopsy, a target-only FBx strategy could be considered because of the low yield on systematic biopsy.  Patient summary:   We found that random prostate sampling adds little diagnostic value in men who are undergoing a targeted biopsy of suspicious lesions found on imaging, especially for men who have had a prior negative biopsy.""","""['Neal Patel', 'Eliza Cricco-Lizza', 'Khushabhu Kasabwala', 'Chris Xu', 'Brian D Robinson', 'Francesca Khani', 'Yi Wang', 'Daniel Margolis', 'Jim C Hu']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Eur Urol Oncol""","""[""Corrigendum to 'The Role of Systematic and Targeted Biopsies in Light of Overlap on Magnetic Resonance Imaging Ultrasound Fusion Biopsy' European Urology Oncology 1 (2018) 263-267."", 'Optimizing the Number of Cores Targeted During Prostate Magnetic Resonance Imaging Fusion Target Biopsy.', 'A Multicentre Analysis of the Detection of Clinically Significant Prostate Cancer Following Transperineal Image-fusion Targeted and Nontargeted Systematic Prostate Biopsy in Men at Risk.', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging-Ultrasound Fusion Biopsy During Prostate Cancer Active Surveillance.', 'Prostate Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Magnetic Resonance Imaging Targeted Biopsy in Patients with a Prior Negative Biopsy: A Consensus Statement by AUA and SAR.', 'Detection of Clinically Significant Prostate Cancer Using Magnetic Resonance Imaging-Ultrasound Fusion Targeted Biopsy: A Systematic Review.', 'Partial-gland Cryoablation Outcomes for Localized Prostate Cancer in Patients with Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)-visible and MRI-invisible Lesions.', 'Intensive sampling of the umbra and penumbra improves clinically significant prostate cancer detection and reduces risk of grade group upgrading at radical prostatectomy.', 'Race and prostate imaging: implications for targeted biopsy and image-based prostate cancer interventions.', 'Value of systematic sampling in an mp-MRI targeted prostate biopsy strategy.', 'The primacy of multiparametric MRI in men with suspected prostate cancer.']"""

Objective:   We examined in-hospital mortality (IHM) rates according to the presence, absence, and location of metastatic disease in a similar highly select cohort of BCa patients treated with radical cystectomy (RC).  Design, setting, and participants:   We used data for 25 004 BCa patients included in the National Inpatients Sample (NIS) database between 1998 and 2013.  Intervention:   Radical cystectomy.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   We tested postoperative IHM rates according to the presence of metastases and the location of metastatic disease (exclusive nodal vs distant metastases). Multivariable logistic regression analyses were adjusted for age, gender, race, comorbidities, length of hospitalization, hospital location, teaching status, hospital surgical volume, and bed size.  Results and limitations:   Among 25 004 BCa patients treated with RC, 3830 (14.4%) had nonregional lymph node metastases (NRNM), 693 (2.8%) had distant metastases (DM), and 19 965 (79.8%) had nonmetastatic disease. Virtually all patients with metastatic BCa had a single metastatic focus (n=4020; 93.7%). In multivariable logistic regression analyses, DM (odds ratio [OR] 2.31, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.57-3.28; p<0.001) but not NRNM (OR 0.88, 95% CI 0.66-1.15; p=0.4) was associated with higher risk of IHM. The absence of information on preoperative chemotherapy and the retrospective study design may limit our findings.  Conclusions:   The risk of IHM for highly select individuals with NRNM treated with RC is similar to that for patients with nonmetastatic BCa. Conversely, patients with DM are at higher risk of IHM compared to patients with NRNM.

Objective:   To determine if the trend for NOC and pT3-4 PCa is also evident among contemporary North American patients.  Design, setting, and participants:   Within the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database (2010-2014), we identified 58 558 patients with clinically localized PCa treated with RP. Only patients with clinical stage T1-2 and biopsy Gleason grade group (GGG) 1-3 PCa were included.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Annual trend analyses and multivariable logistic regression models focused on the rate of NOC PCa, the rate of primary pathologic Gleason ≥4 PCa, and the rate of either NOC PCa and/or primary pathologic Gleason ≥4 PCa. Adjustment was made for clinical tumor characteristics (prostatic specific antigen [PSA], clinical stage, and biopsy GGG).  Results and limitations:   The rate of NOC PCa increased during the study period (18.7% vs 24.2%; p=0.002) and remained significant after adjustment (16.9% vs 22.3%; p=0.001) Similarly, the rate of pathologic primary Gleason ≥4 PCa increased during the study period (16.8% vs 23.0%, p=0.001) and remained significant after multivariable adjustment (10.8% vs 14.2%; p=0.002). Moreover, virtually the same findings were recorded when both endpoints were combined. Our results were confirmed in multivariable logistic regression analyses in which year of diagnosis was modeled as a continuous variable or a categorical variable or when a cubic spline approach was used.  Conclusions:   Rates of NOC PCa and primary Gleason ≥4 PCa increased over time among contemporary North American patients treated with RP. This finding may be related to better acceptance of active surveillance and watchful waiting by North American patients.

Prior studies have primarily evaluated the variability in prediction of biochemical recurrence.  Objective:   To examine the impact of different definitions on mortality after radical prostatectomy (RP).  Design, setting, and participants:   Retrospective study of 6477 men with clinically localized disease undergoing RP at Barnes-Jewish Hospital (St. Louis, MO, USA) and Cleveland Clinic (Cleveland, OH, USA) between 1995 and 2007.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Seven pretreatment definitions of high-risk PC (prostate-specific antigen [PSA] ≥20ng/ml, biopsy Gleason score 8-10, clinical stage ≥T2c, cT3, D'Amico definition, National Comprehensive Cancer Network definition, Kattan nomogram) were evaluated. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to generate unadjusted survival estimates. Multivariable Cox proportional hazard regression models (controlling for age) were used to estimate the hazard ratio (HR) for PC-specific mortality (PCSM) and overall mortality (OM) in the high-risk group compared to men with lower risk not meeting that definition.  Results and limitations:   6477 men were treated with RP from 1995 to 2007 and were followed for a median of 67 mo. Depending on the definition, patients with high-risk PC comprised between 0.7% (when using cT3 as the criterion) and 8.2% (when using the D'Amico criterion) of the population. The 10-yr PC survival estimates varied from 89.7% (PSA ≥20ng/ml) to 69.7% (cT3) and overall survival ranged from 83.4% to 58.1%. On multivariable analysis, all high-risk definitions were associated with a higher risk of PCSM compared to lower risk (HR ranging from 4.38 for PSA ≥20ng/ml to 19.97 for cT3; all p<0.001). All definitions of high risk except for preoperative PSA ≥20ng/ml were associated with a higher risk of OM (HR 1.72 for D'Amico to 3.31 for cT3; all p<0.01).  Conclusions:   Heterogeneity in outcomes existed, depending on the pretreatment definition of high-risk PC. Clinical stage T3 and Gleason score 8-10 were most strongly associated with PCSM and OM.  Patient summary:   There is variability in prostate cancer outcomes after surgery, depending on the definition of pretreatment high-risk disease used.

Objective:   To evaluate the effect of ADT on quality of life (QoL), patients' experience of clinical check-ups, and differences in cancer information as explanatory factors.  Design, setting, and participants:   A study-specific questionnaire was sent to all men randomized in the SPCG-4 trial to radical prostatectomy (RP) or watchful waiting (WW) still alive (400/695) and a control group of 281 men.  Intervention:   ADT.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Self-assessed QoL, worry at clinical check-ups, and amount of information received. Estimated relative risks with associated 95% confidence intervals (CI) for risk comparisons between groups using a log-binomial regression.  Results and limitations:   The SPCG-4 men had median follow-up of 12.2 yr and median age of 77.0 yr; 26% in the RP group and 40% in the WW group received ADT treatment. High QoL for men without ADT was 36% for the RP group, 44% for the WW group, and 45% for the control group. High QoL for men with ADT was 30% for the RP group and 20% for the WW group. Among men with ADT, those in the WW group received significantly less information about the disease than men in the RP group. Receiving no or little information about prostate cancer was reported by 17% of patients in the RP group and 39% in the WW group among men receiving ADT (relative risk 0.44, 95% CI 0.22-0.89). At clinical check-ups, men treated with ADT had significantly higher levels of worry, regardless of study group, than men without ADT. Limitations include the lack of longitudinal data and a low number of men receiving ADT in the RP group.  Conclusions:   Men on WW without ADT reported high QoL comparable to that for men without prostate cancer. ADT treatment in the WW group was associated with the lowest scores for all psychological parameters, and these men reported that they were least informed about prostate cancer and its consequences.

Objective:   To assess quality of life and in-field recurrence following focal laser ablation (FLA).  Design, setting, and participants:   Of 34 men participating in a prospective outcomes study following FLA, 32 underwent prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at 6 mo and 2 yr. All underwent assessment of urinary and sexual function at 1 yr.  Intervention:   FLA and MRI-targeted biopsy of the ablation zone.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   The American Urological Association Symptom Score and the Sexual Health Inventory for Men at baseline and 12 mo were compared using a two-sided Wilcoxon signed-rank test with a significance level of p=0.05. The percentage of positive and negative in-field biopsies was calculated for suspicious and nonsuspicious post-ablation MRI scans.  Results and limitations:   FLA was associated with no adverse impact on urinary or sexual function. For men with suspicious MRI (MRI+) findings, in-field disease recurrence of intermediate and low risk disease was detected in 75% and 25% of cases, respectively. For men with nonsuspicious MRI (MRI-) findings, in-field disease recurrence of intermediate- and low-risk disease was detected in 22.4% and 50% of cases, respectively. The change in PSA from baseline did not discriminate cases with MRI- findings with and without cancer at 2 yr.  Conclusions:   MRI reliably identifies in-field recurrence of only intermediate-risk prostate cancer at 2 yr after FLA. A biopsy of the ablation zone must be performed for MRI+ findings. The decision to perform an ablation-zone biopsy for men with MRI- scans should be influenced by whether detection of low-risk disease would influence management.

The best way of performing targeted biopsies and the effect of operator expertise have still to be defined.  Objective:   To compare the rate of detection of clinically significant prostate cancer (csPCa) of different mpMRI targeted approaches and to assess the role of operator expertise in the detection of csPCa.  Design, setting, and participants:   We included 244 consecutive patients who underwent both 12-core transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) biopsy and mpMRI targeted biopsy with either a cognitive biopsy (CB) or fusion biopsy (FB) approach during the same session between 2013 and 2016 at a single tertiary referral centre.  Intervention:   All men underwent 1.5-T mpMRI with an endorectal coil. All biopsies were performed by three operators as their first cases of targeted biopsy. Lesions with a Prostate Imaging Recording and Data System (PI-RADS) v.2 score of ≥3 detected at mpMRI were targeted. OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: csPCa was defined as disease with a Gleason score at biopsy of ≥7. Operator expertise was coded as the progressive number of targeted biopsies performed by each physician. Multivariable logistic regression analyses (MVA) were used to assess the association between the targeted biopsy technique (FB vs CB) and operator expertise for detection of csPCa. Covariates consisted of prostate-specific antigen, prostate volume, PI-RADS v.2 (3 vs >3), number of targeted cores per MRI lesion, and digital rectal examination (negative vs positive). The same analyses were performed for patients undergoing FB only after accounting for the FB approach (transrectal vs transperineal). A lowess smoothing weighted function was used to graphically assess the effect of operator expertise on the probability of detecting csPCa, after accounting for all confounders.  Results and limitations:   Overall, 157 patients (64%) underwent FB and 87 (36%) underwent CB. The overall csPCa detection rate was 58% for FB and 45% for CB (p=0.07). A significantly higher rate of csPCa detection in targeted samples was observed for FB compared to CB (57% vs 36%; p=0.002). On MVA, FB and operator expertise were significantly associated with a higher probability of csPCa detection in targeted samples (odds ratio [OR] 2.4 and 1.7, respectively; both p≤0.03). When the same analyses were repeated for patients undergoing FB, operator expertise remained an independent predictor of csPCa detection (OR 1.9; p=0.004). An increase in the probability of detecting csPCa with the number of procedures performed was observed after accounting for all confounders.  Conclusions:   We demonstrated that FB had higher detection rate than CB for csPCa. Moreover, operator expertise was significantly associated with higher detection rates for csPCa.  Patient summary:   When different targeted biopsy techniques were compared, fusion biopsy provided a higher detection rate compared to cognitive biopsy for clinically significant prostate cancer (csPCa).

Risk-based patient selection could help to selectively identify men with significant prostate cancer (PCa) and thus reduce unnecessary mpMRI and biopsies.  Objectives:   To compare PCa detection rates for mpMRI TBx with SBx and to determine the rate of potentially avoided mpMRI and biopsies through risk-based selection using the Rotterdam Prostate Cancer Risk Calculator (RPCRC).  Design, setting, and participants:   Two-hundred consecutive biopsy-naïve men in two centres underwent mpMRI scanning, 12-core SBx, and subsequent MRI-TRUS TBx in the case of suspicious lesion(s) (Prostate Imaging-Reporting and Data System v.2 score ≥3).  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   We measured the detection rate for high-grade (Gleason score ≥ 3+4) PCa for TBx and SBx. We carried out a retrospective stratification according to RPCRC biopsy advice to determine the rate of mpMRI and biopsies that could potentially be avoided by RPCRC-based patient selection in relation to the rate of high-grade PCa missed.  Results and limitations:   TBx yielded high-grade PCa in 51 men (26%) and low-grade PCa in 14 men (7%), while SBx yielded high-grade PCa in 63 men (32%) and low-grade PCa in 41 men (21%). Four out of 73 men (5%) with negative RPCRC advice and 63 out of 127 men (50%) with positive advice had high-grade PCa. Upfront RPCRC-based patient selection for mpMRI and TBx would have avoided 73 out of 200 (37%) mpMRI scans, missing two out of 51 (4%) high-grade PCas. Limitations include the RPCRC definition of high- and low-grade PCa and different mpMRI techniques.  Conclusions:   mpMRI with TBx detected PCa with high Gleason score and avoided biopsy in low-grade PCa, but failed to detect all high-grade PCa when compared to SBx among biopsy-naïve men. Risk-based patient selection using the RPCRC can avoid one-third of mpMRI scans and SBx in biopsy-naïve men.  Patient summary:   Men with a suspicion of prostate cancer are increasingly undergoing a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan. Although promising, MRI-targeted biopsy is not accurate enough to safely replace systematic prostate biopsy for now.

However, the effect of primary and secondary androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) on PSMA PET uptake has not been described.  Objective:   To prospectively evaluate changes in 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET uptake on initiation of androgen receptor (AR)-targeted therapy.  Design, setting, and participants:   Prospective single-institution study of patients with metastatic castration-sensitive (n=4) and castration-resistant prostate cancer (n=4) starting treatment with ADT and enzalutamide, respectively, who underwent serial 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET imaging before and after treatment initiation.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   The percentage change in 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET uptake from baseline was descriptively reported and graphically represented.  Results and limitations:   Early increases in PSMA PET tracer uptake in at least one metastatic lesion were observed in six out of seven patients who achieved subsequent prostate-specific antigen declines of >50% from baseline. Overall, 22 of 45 metastatic lesions (49%) exhibited early increases in PSMA uptake that were indicative of a flare effect rather than disease progression. Considerable intra- and interpatient heterogeneity was observed in the temporal pattern of PSMA uptake on treatment initiation. Study limitations include the sample size, the variable timing for scan acquisition, and limited long-term follow up.  Conclusions:   Tumor flare in PSMA PET tracer uptake in the absence of disease progression is variably observed on initiation of AR-targeted treatment. Further studies are needed to delineate the factors controlling PSMA expression to optimize the diagnostic yield.  Patient summary:   Flares of increased prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) tracer uptake on positron emission tomography scans are variably observed following initiation of hormone therapy for prostate cancer and do not necessarily represent disease progression. There was considerable variability in PSMA expression between patients, and further studies are needed to understand the factors controlling PSMA expression.""","""['Rahul Aggarwal', 'Xiao Wei', 'Won Kim', 'Eric J Small', 'Charles J Ryan', 'Peter Carroll', 'Matthew Cooperberg', 'Michael J Evans', 'Thomas Hope']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Eur Urol Oncol""","""['Evaluation of PSMA expression changes on PET/CT before and after initiation of novel antiandrogen drugs (enzalutamide or abiraterone) in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer patients.', 'Rapid Modulation of PSMA Expression by Androgen Deprivation: Serial 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET in Men with Hormone-Sensitive and Castrate-Resistant Prostate Cancer Commencing Androgen Blockade.', 'Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen Ligand Positron Emission Tomography in Men with Nonmetastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen (PSMA)-Targeted PET Imaging of Prostate Cancer: An Update on Important Pitfalls.', 'Current application and future perspectives of prostate specific membrane antigen PET imaging in prostate cancer.', 'Novel radionuclide therapy combinations in prostate cancer.', 'Bipolar Androgen Therapy: When Excess Fuel Extinguishes the Fire.', 'The significance of metabolic response to neoadjuvant androgen deprivation therapy detected with 68GaGa-PSMA-11-PET/CT in high-risk prostate cancer patients treated with definitive radiotherapy.', 'Quantitative assessment of PSMA PET response to therapy in castration-sensitive prostate cancer using an automated imaging platform for disease identification and measurement.', 'Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen Expression on PET/CT in Patients with Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer: A Retrospective Observational Study.']"""

The role of radical prostatectomy (RP) in this setting is unclear.  Objective:   To evaluate the oncological and functional outcomes of men with mPCA who underwent cytoreductive RP (CRP).  Design, setting, and participants:   Retrospective, multi-institutional study of 113 patients with biopsy-proven mPCA who fulfilled the following selection criteria: (1) completely resectable PCA; (2) osseous metastases; (3) absence of gross retroperitoneal lymph node metastases; (4) absence of bulky pelvic lymph node metastases >3cm; (5) no or minimal visceral metastases; (6) Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0-1; and (7) written informed consent.  Intervention:   CRP with extended pelvic lymphadenectomy. Eighty patients (70.8%) received neoadjuvant ADT and 91 (86.5%) adjuvant ADT and/or radiation therapy.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Cancer-specific survival, overall survival (OS), biochemical relapse-free survival (BRFS), and clinical relapse-free survival (CRFS) were evaluated using descriptive statistical analyses, the Kaplan-Meier method, and univariate and multivariate analyses. Treatment-associated complications were analysed according to the Clavien-Dindo classification.  Results and limitations:   The mean patient age was 61 yr (range 42-69). The mean follow-up was 53.6 mo (range 13-96, median 45.7). The 3-yr and 5-yr OS was 99 (87.6%) and 90 (79.6%), respectively, and the mean CRFS was 72.3 mo. Preoperative prostate-specific antigen (PSA)<1.0ng/ml and PSA below the median of 8.0ng/ml were significantly associated with BRFS (p<0.0004). Pathohistology revealed viable PCA in all cases: 16 (14.2%) had pT4a, 21 (18.6%) had pT2a-c, and 76 (67.3%) had pT3a/b PCA. Positive lymph nodes were identified in 61.6% and positive surgical margins in 36.8% of the patients. Eleven men (9.7%) experienced Clavien Dindo grade IIIa-b complications. Low-volume disease, neoadjuvant ADT, and preoperative PSA were significantly associated with a lower risk of surgery-related complications (p<0.05). No, mild (1-2 pads/d), and severe incontinence (>2 pads/d) was observed in 68.1%, 17.7%, and 14.1%, respectively. Limitations of the study are the retrospective nature and potential patient selection bias.  Conclusions:   CRP results in 5-yr OS of 80%, a low rate of significant complications, and good functional outcome in well-selected patients. CRP might be an individualised treatment option in the multimodal management of mPCA.  Patient summary:   We assessed oncological and functional outcomes associated with cytoreductive radical prostatectomy (CRP) in select men with prostate cancer and osseous metastases. We found that CRP might be associated with long overall and relapse-free survival in well-selected patients.

Objective:   To investigate OSC and factors associated with OSC among men with low-risk PC.  Design, setting, and participants:   Men registered in the National Prostate Cancer Register of Sweden as diagnosed in 2008 with low-risk PC at the age of ≤70 yr who had undergone radical prostatectomy (RP), radiotherapy (RT), or started on active surveillance (AS) were invited in 2015 to participate in this nationwide population-based survey (n=1720).  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   OSC data were analysed using ordinal logistic regression. Odds ratios (ORs) were calculated for comparisons between the highest and lowest possible response categories.  Results and limitations:   A total of 1288 men (74.9%) responded. High OSC was reported by 958 (74.4%). Factors associated with high OSC were high participation in decision-making (OR 4.18, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.61-6.69), receiving more information (OR 11.1, 95% CI 7.97-15.6), high-quality information (OR 7.85, 95% CI 5.46-11.3), access to a nurse navigator (OR 1.80, 95% CI 1.44-2.26), and better functional outcomes (defined as 25 points higher on the EPIC-26 questionnaire; OR 1.34, 95% CI 1.21-1.48). OSC was not affected by whether a doctor or specialist nurse conducted follow-up (OR 0.84, 95% CI 0.66-1.07). These findings were similar across treatment groups. Men who had undergone RP or RT reported high OSC more often than men on AS (78.2% vs 84.0% vs 72.6%), high participation in decision-making (70.5% vs 64.5% vs 49.2%), and having received more information (40.5% vs 45.8% vs 28.6%), and were less likely to believe they would die from PC (3.8% vs 3.9% vs 8.0%). Limitations include the nonrandomised retrospective design and potential recall bias.  Conclusions:   Information and participation in decision-making, as well as access to a nurse navigator, are key factors for OSC, regardless of treatment. Men on AS need more information about their treatment and need to participate more in decision-making. OSC was as high among men who had nurse-led follow-up as among men who had doctor-led follow-up.  Patient summary:   Information about how men with low-risk prostate cancer experience their medical care is limited. In this nationwide population-based study we found that information and participation in decision-making as well as access to a nurse navigator are key factors for satisfaction regardless of treatment.

Given the growing interest in targeted biopsy and focal therapy, improving our knowledge on the relationship between mpMRI parameters and the ability to predict csPCa multifocality is mandatory.  Objective:   To assess whether the Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) score for the index lesion (IL) may predict multifocal csPCa undetected by mpMRI.  Design, setting, and participants:   The study included 343 patients who underwent mpMRI of the prostate with subsequent biopsy between 2014 and 2017 at a single tertiary care referral centre.  Intervention:   Lesions with a PI-RADS v.2 score ≥2 detected at mpMRI (IL) were targeted with a fusion biopsy (Bx) approach (mpMRI-Bx). Moreover, each patient underwent a random extended transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsy (TRUS-Bx) during the same session. OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: csPCa outside the IL was defined as disease detected at TRUS-Bx with a Gleason score (GS)≥3+4 and equal to or greater than the GS for the IL. The extent of csPCa detected in target and random cores was reported and stratified according to the GS and PI-RADS score for the IL. The probability of diagnosing csPCa outside the IL according to the PI-RADS score was also assessed in multivariable logistic regression analyses (MVA) after accounting for confounders.  Results and limitations:   The detection rate for csPCa outside the IL was 30%. The detection rate for csPCa at TRUS-Bx was 8% for PI-RADS 2, 15% for PI-RADS 3, 36% for PI-RADS 4, and 58% for PI-RADS 5 lesions (p=0.03). Overall, the median length of csPCa found at TRUS-Bx and thus missed at mpMRI was 2.6mm. However, the length significantly increased with PI-RADS score for the IL, and was 1.8, 2.3, 2.8, and 3.8mm for PI-RADS 2, 3, 4, and 5 lesions, respectively (p=0.03). On MVA, PI-RADS 4 (odds ratio [OR] 7.6; p=0.008) and PI-RADS 5 scores (OR 17.3; p<0.001) were independent predictors of the presence of csPCa outside the IL. The study is limited by its retrospective design.  Conclusions:   Overall, the accuracy of mpMRI in identifying multifocal csPCa is poor, missing low-volume csPCa in approximately 30% of patients. Moreover, the rate and the extent of csPCa undetected by mpMRI significantly increased with the PI-RADS score for the IL, which can thus be considered a proxy for tumour multifocality.  Patient summary:   The accuracy of multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging in identifying prostate cancer multifocality is poor. False negative findings were highly related to the PI-RADS score of the index lesion. These findings raise concerns about the indication for targeting the index lesion only when considering prostate biopsy and focal approaches.""","""['Armando Stabile', ""Paolo Dell'Oglio"", 'Francesco De Cobelli', 'Antonio Esposito', 'Giorgio Gandaglia', 'Nicola Fossati', 'Giorgio Brembilla', 'Giulia Cristel', 'Gianpiero Cardone', ""Federico Deho'"", 'Andrea Losa', 'Nazareno Suardi', 'Franco Gaboardi', 'Alessandro Del Maschio', 'Francesco Montorsi', 'Alberto Briganti']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Eur Urol Oncol""","""['Not All Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging-targeted Biopsies Are Equal: The Impact of the Type of Approach and Operator Expertise on the Detection of Clinically Significant Prostate Cancer.', 'Comparison of Cancer Detection Rates Between TRUS-Guided Biopsy and MRI-Targeted Biopsy According to PSA Level in Biopsy-Naive Patients: A Propensity Score Matching Analysis.', 'There Is No Way to Avoid Systematic Prostate Biopsies in Addition to Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging Targeted Biopsies.', 'Multiparametric MRI in detection and staging of prostate cancer.', 'Positive Predictive Value of Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System Version 2 for the Detection of Clinically Significant Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.', 'Can a prostate biopsy be safely deferred on PI-RADS 1,2 or 3 lesions seen on pre-biopsy mp-MRI?', 'CT texture analysis and node-RADS CT score of mediastinal lymph nodes - diagnostic performance in lung cancer patients.', 'Assessing the need for systematic biopsies in addition to targeted biopsies according to the characteristics of the index lesion at mpMRI.

To date, cancer screening patterns by smoking status, a major cancer risk factor, are unknown.  Objective:   To assess cancer screening patterns among individuals who never smoked (never smokers), formerly smoked (former smokers), and currently smoke (current smokers) in the United States.  Design, setting, and participants:   This cross-sectional study assessed data from the National Health Interview Survey years 2010, 2013, and 2015. Adult participants (aged ≥18 years) who had never reported a cancer diagnosis were included in the analysis. Data were analyzed from August 1, 2018, through February 1, 2019.  Exposures:   Receipt of cancer screening, including colonoscopy, mammography, prostate-specific antigen testing, and Papanicolaou test per the US Preventive Services Task Force guidelines.  Main outcomes and measures:   Multivariable logistic regression defined adjusted odds ratios (AORs) and 95% CIs for undergoing cancer screening by smoking status. Among participants who received a specific screening test, AORs and 95% CIs of receiving the test within guideline-recommended intervals were also assessed.  Results:   Among 83 176 participants (45 851 [55.1%] women; mean [SD] age, 47 [18] years), 51 014 (61.3%) were never smokers; 17 235 (20.7%), former smokers; and 14 927 (17.9%), current smokers. Compared with never smokers, current smokers were less likely to ever have received a colonoscopy (43.8% vs 57.7%; AOR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.68-0.82; P < .001), mammogram (88.8% vs 93.3%; AOR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.57-0.87; P = .001), or prostate-specific antigen test (46.1% vs 60.8%; AOR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.64-0.90; P = .001). Among those who had ever received a specific screening test, current smokers were less likely to have undergone colonoscopy (92.1% vs 95.1%; AOR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.59-0.96; P = .02), mammography (62.4% vs 79.4%; AOR, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.45-0.60; P < .001), or Papanicolaou test (80.9% vs 90.8%; AOR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.56-0.67; P < .001) within the recommended time frame compared with never smokers. Former smokers were more likely than never smokers to undergo any of the screening studies evaluated, with the exception of prostate-specific antigen screening (colonoscopy, 65.2% vs 57.7%; AOR, 1.20; 95% CI, 1.12-1.30; P < .001; mammography, 95.7% vs 93.3%; AOR, 1.35; 95% CI, 1.07-1.70; P = .01; Papanicolaou test, 97.6% vs 91.4%; AOR, 2.51; 95% CI, 1.93-3.26; P < .001).

Global data mask the social and health disparities that influence cancer incidence and survival. Inequality in exposure to carcinogens, education, access to quality diagnostic services, and affordable treatments all affect the probability of survival. Worryingly, despite the fact that many cancers could be prevented by stronger public health actions and many others could be largely cured by better access to diagnostics and affordable treatments, the international community has yet to make a substantial move to tackle this challenge. In prostate cancer, studies show that there are geographic and racial/ethnic distribution differences as well as a number of other variables, including environmental factors, limited access to standard cancer treatments, reduced probability to be included in trials, and the financial burden of cancer treatments. Financial burden for the patients can result in poor adherence, increased debt, and poor long-term outcomes.

Global notch inhibition of multiple Notch family members using γ-secretase inhibitors has shown efficacy in suppressing PCa growth in murine models. However, global Notch inhibition is associated with marked toxicity due to the widespread function of many different Notch family members in normal cell physiology. Accordingly, in the current study, we explored if specific inhibition of Notch1 would effectively inhibit PCa growth in a murine model. The androgen-dependent VCaP and androgen-independent DU145 cell lines were injected subcutaneously into mice. The mice were treated with either control antibody 1B7.11, anti-Notch1 antibody (OMP-A2G1), docetaxel or the combination of OMP-A2G1 and docetaxel. Tumor growth was measured using calipers. At the end of the study, tumors were assessed for proliferative response, apoptotic response, Notch target gene expression, and DNA damage response (DDR) expression. OMP-A2G1 alone inhibited tumor growth of both PCa cell lines to a greater extent than docetaxel alone. There was no additive or synergistic effect of OMP-A2G1 and docetaxel. The primary toxicity was weight loss that was controlled with dietary supplementation. Proliferation and apoptosis were affected differentially in the two cell lines. OMP-A2G1 increased expression of the DDR gene GADD45α in VCaP cells but downregulated GADD45α in Du145 cells. Taken together, these data show that Notch1 inhibition decreases PCa xenograft growth but does so through different mechanisms in the androgen-dependent VCaP cell line vs the androgen-independent DU145 cell line.

Materials and methods:   Data from a prospectively maintained, single-institution database were analyzed for patients who underwent mpMRI prior to RP (2007-2016). Index tumor was defined as a T2-visible lesion with the longest diameter. Adverse pathologic outcomes were extraprostatic extension (EPE), lymph node invasion (LNI), seminal vesicle invasion (SVI), and positive margins (PM). Logistic and Cox proportional hazard regression were used to assess associations with adverse pathology and biochemical recurrence (BCR), respectively.  Results:   Of the 455 patients included, EPE, LNI, SVI and PM were present in 23.5%, 6.2%, 5.5% and 15.7% patients, respectively. Patients with adverse pathologic outcomes had larger median ITV.

In our collected specimens, however, LITAF showed low expression in glioma tissues compared to that in the normal brain tissue. Proliferation and apoptosis of glioma cells were not affected by knockdown or overexpression of LITAF in glioma U251, U373, and U87 cells, but LITAF was able to enhance the radiosensitivity of glioma cells. Furthermore, we found that LITAF enhanced radiosensitivity via FoxO1 and its specific downstream targets BIM, TRAIL, and FASLG.

Materials and methods:   A total of 131 males with suspected prostate cancer were recruited to undergo fusion biopsy with the Artemis prostate fusion biopsy device (Eigen, Grass Valley, CA, USA). All patients underwent standard 12-core systematic biopsies in addition to biopsies targeted at the mpMRI-identified abnormal regions. Yield from the standard cores was compared with that from the targeted cores. Gleason scores of 4+3 or higher were considered significant.  Results:   The mean age of the patients was 63.54±7.96 years and the mean prostate-specific antigen value was 9.75±5.35 ng/mL. A total of 36 patients had cancer, of which 3 (8.3%) were detected only on standard cores and 3 (8.3%) only on targeted cores. Of the clinically significant cancers (n=30), targeted biopsy detected a higher number (28/30, 93.3%) than standard biopsy (21/30, 70.0%). A total of 6 of 8 cancers (75.0%) that were insignificant on standard biopsy were upgraded to significant cancer on targeted cores.  Conclusions:   Eight percent of cancers were detected only on MRI-TRUS fusion-targeted biopsies, whereas the method upgraded more than two-thirds of insignificant cancers to significant cancers. Fusion biopsies thus provide incremental information over standard TRUS biopsies in the diagnosis of significant prostate cancer in populations with a low incidence of prostate cancer.""","""['Rohit Kaushal', 'Chandan J Das', 'Prabhjot Singh', 'Prem Nath Dogra', 'Rajeev Kumar']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Investig Clin Urol""","""['Transperineal Versus Transrectal MRI/TRUS Fusion Targeted Biopsy: Detection Rate of Clinically Significant Prostate Cancer.', 'Critical evaluation of magnetic resonance imaging targeted, transrectal ultrasound guided transperineal fusion biopsy for detection of prostate cancer.', 'Accuracy of Transperineal Targeted Prostate Biopsies, Visual Estimation and Image Fusion in Men Needing Repeat Biopsy in the PICTURE Trial.', 'Magnetic resonance imaging-transrectal ultrasound image fusion guidance of prostate biopsies: current status, challenges and future perspectives.', 'Magnetic resonance imaging-transrectal ultrasound fusion image-guided prostate biopsy: Current status of the cancer detection and the prospects of tailor-made medicine of the prostate cancer.', 'MRI/Transrectal Ultrasound Fusion-Guided Targeted Biopsy and Transrectal Ultrasound-Guided Systematic Biopsy for Diagnosis of Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.', 'Changing trends in robot-assisted radical prostatectomy: Inverse stage migration-A retrospective analysis.', 'Diagnostic accuracy of magnetic resonance imaging targeted biopsy techniques compared to transrectal ultrasound guided biopsy of the prostate: a systematic review and meta-analysis.']"""

Materials and methods:   Between 2009 and 2016, 13 MCRNLMP and 17 MCRCC cases were selected. Tumor tissues from 5 MCRNLMP and 16 MCRCC cases were subjected to gene sequencing to detect mutations among 88 genes selected from a kidney cancer gene panel after quality control.

The aim of this study was to assess the accuracy of the CAPRA-S score for predicting biochemical progression at 5 and 10 years in our cohort of patients after radical prostatectomy.  Patients and methods:   Between June 2004 and December 2015, radical prostatectomy was performed as the main treatment option for patients with localized prostate cancer. Patients who had received adjuvant or neoadjuvant treatment were excluded from this study. Biochemical progression after radical prostatectomy was considered in patients by prostate-specific antigen (PSA) > 0.1 ng/mL after surgery (biochemical persistence) and by at least 2 determinations of PSA > 0.2 ng/mL in those patients with initial undetectable postoperative PSA any time during their follow-up (biochemical failure). Cox proportional hazard model and Kaplan-Meier analysis were used for the statistical analysis.  Results:   Of 531 patients who underwent radical prostatectomy, 479 met the inclusion criteria. Mean follow-up was 85 months (min-max, 13-153 months).

Here we simulate the dose coverage of intraprostatic lesions (IPL) by simultaneous integrated boosts (SIB). For this purpose, we use a large sample of actual intrafraction motion data.  Methods:   Fifty-three h of intra-fraction motion of the prostate were recorded in real-time by 4D ultrasound (4DUS) during 720 fractions in 28 patients. We simulate spherical IPLs with 3, 5, and 7 mm radius and matching spherical SIBs with 0, 2, and 5 mm safety margins. The volumetric overlap between IPLs and SIBs is calculated. Dose volume histograms (DVH) are estimated by Monte Carlo simulation.  Results:   On average, the distance of the prostate was 1.3 mm from its initial position over all fractions and patients. Average volumetric overlap was 73, 82, and 87% of IPL volume in case of 3, 5, and 7 mm IPLs and SIBs without safety margins. These improved to 95% or more in case of 2 mm safety margins and 98% or more in case of 5 mm safety margins. DVHs showed that 80% of the IPL volume received 60, 72, and 79% of maximum dose in case of 3, 5, and 7 mm IPLs and SIBs without safety margins. These improved to 94% or more given moderately sized safety margins of 2 mm.  Conclusions:   On average over all fractions and patients, the dose coverage would have been acceptable even for small target volumes such as IPLs of radius 3 to 7 mm and narrow fields. Moderate safety margins of 2 mm could have ensured a delivery of 90% or more of the SIB dose to the IPL. In this case, SIB volume would have been considerably larger than IPL volume, but still considerably smaller than the overall PTV of the prostate.""","""['Hendrik Ballhausen', 'Minglun Li', 'Michael Reiner', 'Claus Belka']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Radiat Oncol""","""['DMLC tracking and gating can improve dose coverage for prostate VMAT.', 'Potential benefits of dosimetric VMAT tracking verified with 3D film measurements.', 'Dosimetric consequences of intrafraction prostate motion.', 'Impact of intrafraction prostate motion on clinical target coverage in proton therapy: A simulation study of dosimetric differences in two delivery techniques.', 'Clinical to planning target volume margins in prostate cancer radiotherapy.', 'The ProMotion LMU dataset (2022 edition), prostate intra-fraction motion recorded by transperineal ultrasound.', 'Dosimetric Uncertainties in Dominant Intraprostatic Lesion Simultaneous Boost Using Intensity Modulated Proton Therapy.', 'The ProMotion LMU dataset, prostate intra-fraction motion recorded by transperineal ultrasound.']"""

However, long-term outcomes are unknown. This study investigated the long-term efficacy and cost-effectiveness of bCBT compared with care as usual (CAU).  Methods:   Eighty-eight cancer survivors with high FCR (Cancer Worry Scale ≥14) were randomly assigned to bCBT (n = 45) or CAU (n = 43). Data were collected at baseline and at three, nine and fifteen months from baseline and analysed by modified intention-to-treat. Efficacy was investigated with linear mixed-effects models. Cost-effectiveness was investigated from a societal perspective by comparing costs with quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs).  Results:   Participants who received bCBT reported significantly lower FCR compared with CAU (mean difference of - 1.787 [95% CI -3.251 to - 0.323, p = 0.017] at 15 months follow-up), and proportionally greater self-rated and clinically significant improvement at each follow-up measurement. Total QALYs were non-significantly different between conditions when adjusted for utility score baseline differences (0.984 compared to 0.957, p = 0.385), while total costs were €631 lower (95% CI -1737 to 2794, p = 0.587). Intervention costs of bCBT were €466. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio amounted to an additional €2049 per QALY gained, with a 62% probability that bCBT is cost-effective at a willingness to pay (WTP) threshold of €20,000 per QALY. Results were confirmed in sensitivity analyses.  Conclusions:   bCBT for cancer survivors with FCR is clinically and statistically more effective than CAU on the long-term. In addition, bCBT is a relatively inexpensive intervention with similar costs and QALYs as CAU.

The latter methods rely on the assumption that mortality due to other causes than cancer is the same as the expected mortality in the general population with same demographic characteristics derived from population life tables. This assumption may not hold in clinical trials where patients are likely to be quite different from the general population due to some criteria for patient selection.  Methods:   In this work, we propose and assess the performance of a new flexible population-based model to estimate long-term net survival in clinical trials and that allows for cause-of-death misclassification and for effects of selection. Comparisons were made with cause-specific and other population-based methods in a simulation study and in an application to prostate cancer clinical trial data.  Results:   In estimating net survival, cause-specific methods seemed to introduce important biases associated with the degree of misclassification of cancer deaths. The usual population-based method provides also biased estimates, depending on the strength of the selection effect. Compared to these methods, the new model was able to provide more accurate estimates of net survival in long-term clinical trials.

Nigella sativa essential oil is unstable, volatile, and insoluble in water and these problems confine its usage in developing new medicines.  Objective:   This study focuses on developing a chitosan-based nanocarrier for the encapsulation of Nigella Sativa essential oil. By using Quality by design outline, the quality target product outline, critical quality attributes and critical material attributes were defined by knowledge and risk-based procedures.  Methods:   According to defined critical material attributes, Optimization software (Statgraphics XVII) was used to study the effect of the processing parameters. The processing parameters identified and fixed first with a ""One factor at a time"" approach. Various physicochemical characterization techniques were performed.  Results:   As a result, the ratio of chitosan to benzoic acid (2:1) along with the stirring rate (4000 rpm) produced minimum-sized particles (341 nm) with good stability.

Our study examined how risk for prostate cancer is perceived and experienced by patients undergoing active surveillance with their clinicians, how risk is communicated in clinical consultations, and the implications for treatment and care.  Method:   Participants were nine patients and three clinicians from a university hospital urology clinic. A staged, qualitative, multi-method data collection approach was undertaken, comprising: observations of consultations; patient and clinician interviews; and patient surveys. The three data sets were analysed separately using thematic analysis and then integrated to give a comprehensive view of patient and clinician views.  Results:   Thirty data points (eight patient surveys; 10 observations of consultations between patients and clinicians; 10 patient interviews; and two clinician interviews) combined to create a detailed picture of how patients perceived and appraised risk, in three themes of ""Making sense of risk"", ""Talking about risk"" and ""Responding to risk"".  Conclusion:   Effective risk communication needs to be finely tuned and timed to individual patient's priorities and information requirements. A structured information exchange process that identifies patients' priorities, and details key moments in risk assessment, so that complexities of risk are discussed in ways that are meaningful to patients, may benefit patient care.

The effect of these options on survival in the general population is currently unknown.  Methods:   Cancers for which 2 or more new treatment options have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration during the years 2009 through 2011 for the treatment of advanced disease were identified, including adenocarcinoma of the lung, melanoma, breast cancer, prostate cancer, and renal cell carcinoma. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to compare overall survival for these conditions in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database for the periods 2007 to 2008, 2009 to 2010, and 2011 to 2012. Hazard ratios derived from adjusted, shared frailty models for cancer-specific survival were calculated as well for the years of diagnosis (2007-2008, 2009-2010, and 2011-2012).  Results:   Two-year survival increased for patients with advanced-stage lung adenocarcinoma (+3.0 percentage points), melanoma (+3.4 percentage points), and breast cancer (+2.7 percentage points). When only patients aged 15 to 64 years were included, 2-year survival for those with melanoma increased by +6.7 percentage points. No change in survival was observed for renal cell carcinoma. Decreases in the hazard ratio for cancer-specific mortality were observed during the period 2011 to 2012 compared with 2007 to 2008 for lung adenocarcinoma, melanoma, and breast cancer.  Conclusions:   Small increases in 2-year survival were observed between the periods 2007 to 2008 and 2011 to 2012 for lung adenocarcinoma, melanoma, and prostate cancer. Cancer-specific mortality decreased for each of these cancers among patients who were diagnosed between the periods 2007 to 2008 and 2011 to 2013.

By RNAseq, we uncovered transcriptional heterogeneity among BPH cases, where a 65-gene BPH stromal signature correlated with symptom severity. Stromal signaling molecules BMP5 and CXCL13 were enriched in BPH while estrogen regulated pathways were depleted. Notably, BMP5 addition to cultured prostatic myofibroblasts altered their expression profile towards a BPH profile that included the BPH stromal signature. RNAseq also suggested an altered cellular milieu in BPH, which we verified by immunohistochemistry and single-cell RNAseq. In particular, BPH tissues exhibited enrichment of myofibroblast subsets, whilst depletion of neuroendocrine cells and an estrogen receptor (ESR1)-positive fibroblast cell type residing near epithelium. By whole-exome sequencing, we uncovered somatic single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) in BPH, of uncertain pathogenic significance but indicative of clonal cell expansions.

Given the number of new therapies targeting metastatic and castrate-resistant disease, we sought to describe recent treatment patterns by race for de novo AJCC stage IV prostate cancer.  Methods:   We used Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) data linked to Medicare files to identify men aged 66 and older diagnosed in 2004-2014 with advanced prostate cancer, and examined patterns of treatment among all patients and stratified by race/ethnicity.  Results:   There were 8828 eligible patients identified, and non-Hispanic black (NHB) patients were more likely to go without treatment (P < 0.001) compared to non-Hispanic white (NHW) patients, even after accounting for early mortality and TNM stage. The frequency of nearly all forms of treatment was lower among NHB with the exception of orchiectomy, which was significantly higher (10.1% vs 6.1%, P < 0.001), and the use of the progesterone Megace among Medicare Part D enrollees (24.6% vs 15.0%, P < 0.001).  Conclusions:   Results from this study of elderly Medicare patients presenting with advanced stage prostate cancer suggest that NHB men are less likely to pursue aggressive treatment options.

These cells then infiltrate and reside in the tumour, and can generate new adrenergic neurons. Selective genetic depletion of DCX+ cells inhibits the early phases of tumour development in our mouse models of prostate cancer, whereas transplantation of DCX+ neural progenitors promotes tumour growth and metastasis. In humans, the density of DCX+ neural progenitors is strongly associated with the aggressiveness and recurrence of prostate adenocarcinoma.

Methods:   Capillary electrophoresis/mass spectrometry has been employed to identify urinary peptides that may accurately detect significant prostate cancer. Urine samples from 823 patients with PSA (<15 ng/ml) were collected prior to biopsy. A case-control comparison was performed in a training set of 543 patients (nSig = 98; nnon-Sig = 445) and a validation set of 280 patients (nSig = 48, nnon-Sig = 232). Totally, 19 significant peptides were subsequently combined by a support vector machine algorithm.  Results:   Independent validation of the 19-biomarker model in 280 patients resulted in a 90% sensitivity and 59% specificity, with an AUC of 0.81, outperforming PSA (AUC = 0.58) and the ERSPC-3/4 risk calculator (AUC = 0.69) in the validation set.

Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) is a prototypic oncolytic virus (OV) that induces cancer cell death through activation of the apoptotic pathway, although intrinsic resistance to oncolysis is found in some cell lines and many primary tumors, as a consequence of residual innate immunity to the virus. In the effort to improve OV therapeutic efficacy, we previously demonstrated that different agents, including histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDIs), functioned as reversible chemical switches to dampen the innate antiviral response and improve the susceptibility of resistant cancer cells to VSV infection. In the present study, we demonstrated that the NAD+-dependent histone deacetylase SIRT1 (silent mating type information regulation 2 homolog 1) plays a key role in the permissivity of prostate cancer PC-3 cells to VSVΔM51 replication and oncolysis. HDI-mediated enhancement of VSVΔM51 infection and cancer cell killing directly correlated with a decrease of SIRT1 expression. Furthermore, pharmacological inhibition as well as silencing of SIRT1 by small interfering RNA (siRNA) was sufficient to sensitize PC-3 cells to VSVΔM51 infection, resulting in augmentation of virus replication and spread. Mechanistically, HDIs such as suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA; Vorinostat) and resminostat upregulated the microRNA miR-34a that regulated the level of SIRT1. Taken together, our findings identify SIRT1 as a viral restriction factor that limits VSVΔM51 infection and oncolysis in prostate cancer cells.IMPORTANCE The use of nonpathogenic viruses to target and kill cancer cells is a promising strategy in cancer therapy. However, many types of human cancer are resistant to the oncolytic (cancer-killing) effects of virotherapy. In this study, we identify a host cellular protein, SIRT1, that contributes to the sensitivity of prostate cancer cells to infection by a prototypical oncolytic virus. Knockout of SIRT1 activity increases the sensitivity of prostate cancer cells to virus-mediated killing. At the molecular level, SIRT1 is controlled by a small microRNA termed miR-34a. Altogether, SIRT1 and/or miR-34a levels may serve as predictors of response to oncolytic-virus therapy.""","""['Michela Muscolini', 'Luciano Castiello', 'Enrico Palermo', 'Alessandra Zevini', 'Matteo Ferrari', 'David Olagnier', 'John Hiscott']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""J Virol""","""['Histone deacetylase inhibitors potentiate vesicular stomatitis virus oncolysis in prostate cancer cells by modulating NF-κB-dependent autophagy.', 'Chemical targeting of the innate antiviral response by histone deacetylase inhibitors renders refractory cancers sensitive to viral oncolysis.', 'Changes in Susceptibility to Oncolytic Vesicular Stomatitis Virus during Progression of Prostate Cancer.', 'Vesicular stomatitis virus as a flexible platform for oncolytic virotherapy against cancer.', 'Oncolytic viruses and histone deacetylase inhibitors--a multi-pronged strategy to target tumor cells.', 'The role of viruses in cancer development versus cancer therapy: An oncological perspective.', 'Cellular resistance to an oncolytic virus is driven by chronic activation of innate immunity.', 'Improving cancer immunotherapy by rationally combining oncolytic virus with modulators targeting key signaling pathways.', ""Virtual Screening in the Identification of Sirtuins' Activity Modulators."", 'Nanocarrier drug resistant tumor interactions: novel approaches to fight drug resistance in cancer.']"""

Using RapidCaP, a genetically engineered mouse model of Pten/Trp53 mutant metastatic prostate cancer, we found that complete loss of Phlpp2 paradoxically blocks prostate tumor growth and disease progression. Surprisingly, we find that Phlpp2 is essential for supporting Myc, a key driver of lethal prostate cancer. Phlpp2 dephosphorylates threonine-58 of Myc, which renders it a limiting positive regulator of Myc stability.

Materials and methods:   A total of 26 castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) patients with bone metastases, treated with Ra-223 at our hospital were evaluated. This study aimed to observe adverse events (AEs) and changes in serum markers, and Bone Scan Index (BSI). Additionally, the relationship between these values and OS was investigated.  Results:   The observed AEs mainly included fatigue and nausea. Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and bone-type alkaline phosphatase (BAP) levels decreased following the treatment; however, those of PSA and 1-CTP tended to increase, regardless of Ra-223 administration. Overall survival (OS) was significantly improved in cases with a baseline BSI value of <2 compared with those with a baseline BSI value of ≥2.

Although EMT is a complex process, recently, it has been reported that CD146 overexpression in prostate cancer cells is sufficient to induce mesenchymal phenotype. The following study aimed to investigate whether the expression of CD146 is altered by an epigenetic modifier in prostate cancer cells, in vitro.  Materials and methods:   Three human prostate cancer cell lines were treated with 5-aza-2-deoxycytidine; the expression of CD146 and EMT-related factors was analyzed by RT-PCR and western Blot. The methylation status of the CD146 promoter area was assessed using bisulfite sequencing.  Results:   Our data showed that, the expression of CD146 was evidently increased in all three studied cell lines in response to a demethylating agent, both at the mRNA and protein level, suggesting epigenetic regulation of the analyzed gene. However, there was no methylation in the studied CpG island in CD146 gene promoter. Moreover, the demethylating agent induced the expression of EMT-related transcription factors (SNAI1, SNAI2, TWIST1 and ZEB1), the pattern of which differed among the cell lines, as well as alterations in cell morphology; altogether accounting for the mesenchymal phenotype.  Conclusion:   The demethylating agent 5-aza-2-deoxycytidine triggers the expression of CD146 in prostate cancer cells independently on the methylation status of the analyzed CpG island fragment in CD146 gene promoter. Moreover, demethylation treatment induces a mesenchymal profile in prostate cancer cells.""","""['Paulina Dudzik', 'Sonia E Trojan', 'Barbara Ostrowska', 'Grzegorz Zemanek', 'Joanna Dulińska-Litewka', 'Piotr Laidler', 'Kinga A Kocemba-Pilarczyk']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Anticancer Res""","""['Aberrant promoter methylation may be responsible for the control of CD146 (MCAM) gene expression during breast cancer progression.', 'Epigenetic regulation of the KAI1 metastasis suppressor gene in human prostate cancer cell lines.', 'Promoter CpG-Site Methylation of the KAI1 Metastasis Suppressor Gene Contributes to Its Epigenetic Repression in Prostate Cancer.', 'Knowledge of epigenetic influence for prostate cancer therapy.', 'Abnormal DNA methylation, epigenetics, and prostate cancer.', 'Pre-Clinical Evaluation of the Hypomethylating Agent Decitabine for the Treatment of T-Cell Lymphoblastic Lymphoma.', 'LRWD1 expression is regulated through DNA methylation in human testicular embryonal carcinoma cells.', 'Reactivation of oncogenes involved in G1/S transcription and apoptosis pathways by low dose decitabine promotes HT29 human colon cancer cell growth in vitro.']"""

Screening in asymptomatic men (aged 55-69yr) using prostate-specific antigen (PSA) is associated with a migration toward lower staged disease and a reduction in cancer-specific mortality. By 20yr after testing, around 100 men need to be screened to prevent one PCa death. While this ratio is smaller than for breast and colon cancer, the long natural history of PCa means many men die from other causes. As such, the nonselective use of PSA testing and radical treatments can lead to overdiagnosis and overtreatment. The European Association of Urology (EAU) supports measures to encourage appropriate PCa detection through PSA testing, while reducing overdiagnosis and overtreatment. These goals may be achieved using personalized risk-stratified approaches. For diagnosis, the greatest benefit from early detection is likely to come in men assessed using baseline PSA levels at the age of 45yr to individualize screening intervals. Multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging as well as risk calculators based on family history, ethnicity, digital rectal examination, and prostate volume should be considered to triage the need for biopsy, thus reducing the risk of overdiagnosis. For treatment, the EAU advocates balancing patient's life expectancy and cancer's mortality risk when deciding an approach. Active surveillance is encouraged in well-informed patients with low-risk and some intermediate-risk cancers, as it decreases the risks of overtreatment without compromising oncological outcomes. Conversely, the EAU advocates radical treatment in suitable men with more aggressive PCa. Multimodal treatment should be considered in locally advanced or high-grade cancers. PATIENT SUMMARY: Implementation of prostate-specific antigen (PSA)-based screening should be considered at a population level. Men at risk of prostate cancer should have a baseline PSA blood test (eg, at 45yr). The level of this test, combined with family history, ethnicity, and other factors, can be used to determine subsequent follow-up. Magnetic resonance imaging scans and novel biomarkers should be used to determine which men need biopsy and how any cancers should be treated.""","""['Giorgio Gandaglia', 'Peter Albers', 'Per-Anders Abrahamsson', 'Alberto Briganti', 'James W F Catto', 'Christopher R Chapple', 'Francesco Montorsi', 'Nicolas Mottet', 'Monique J Roobol', 'Jens Sønksen', 'Manfred Wirth', 'Hendrik van Poppel']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Eur Urol""","""['Re: Giorgio Gandaglia G, Peter Albers, Per-Anders Abrahamsson, et al.

Tools for stratifying patients who may have NOC disease are limited.  Objective:   To determine an association of a genomic subtyping classifier (GSC) with pathological upstaging in multi-institutional cohort of patients with cT1-T2 UC treated with RC.  Design, setting, and participants:   Precystectomy transurethral specimens from 206 patients with high-grade, cT1-T2, N0M0 UC, who underwent RC without neoadjuvant chemotherapy, underwent GSC testing.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Uni- and multivariable logistic regression analyses evaluated GSC for upstaging, defined as pT3/T4 and/or pTanyN1-3 disease at RC.  Results and limitations:   Pathological upstaging occurred in 23% of cT1 and 57% of cT2 cases. Lower rates of upstaging to NOC was seen for luminal versus nonluminal tumors (34% vs 51%, p=0.02). The differences in upstaging were confined to T stage, with no difference in node positivity for luminal versus nonluminal patients (cT1: 13% for both [p>0.9], cT2: 15% and 23% [p=0.6], respectively). Fewer patients with luminal tumors were upstaged to ≥pT3Nany compared with nonluminal tumors (Mantel-Haenszel p=0.002; cT1: 13% vs 30%, cT2: 34% vs 58%). On multivariable logistic regression analysis, nonluminal patients were more likely to be upstaged to ≥pT3 at RC (p<0.001). Limitations include retrospective design and sample size.  Conclusions:   Molecular subtyping of clinically localized UC demonstrated that luminal tumors have lower rates of upstaging to non-organ-confined disease compared with nonluminal tumors. If validated, these data can help inform which patients may need multimodal therapy.  Patient summary:   Determining whether bladder cancer has spread beyond the bladder is challenging at diagnosis. In this paper, genomics helped identify patients who were more likely to have aggressive disease that has spread outside the bladder. These patients may benefit from chemotherapy prior to surgery.""","""['Yair Lotan', 'Stephen A Boorjian', 'Jingbin Zhang', 'Trinity J Bivalacqua', 'Sima P Porten', 'Thomas Wheeler', 'Seth P Lerner', 'Ryan Hutchinson', 'Franto Francis', 'Elai Davicioni', 'Robert S Svatek', 'Chun-Liang Chen', 'Peter C Black', 'Ewan A Gibb']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Eur Urol""","""['Limited Upstaging in Luminal Subtype Tumors: Ready for Clinical Practice?', 'Bladder cancer under staging: still unavoidable?', 'Urological Oncology: Bladder, Penis and Urethral Cancer, and Basic Principles of Oncology.', 'A Genomic Classifier for Predicting Clinically Aggressive Luminal Bladder Tumors with Higher Rates of Pathological Up Staging.', 'Upstaging of urothelial cancer at the time of radical cystectomy: factors associated with upstaging and its effect on outcome.', 'The Impact of Lymphovascular Invasion on Risk of Upstaging and Lymph Node Metastasis at the Time of Radical Cystectomy.', 'Oncologic Outcomes of cT1 and cT2 Micropapillary Variant Compared with cT1 and cT2 Conventional Urothelial Carcinoma Treated with Radical Cystectomy.', 'Immunohistochemistry subtyping of urothelial carcinoma is feasible in the daily practice.', 'Predictive Biomarkers of Response to Neoadjuvant Therapy in Muscle Invasive Bladder Cancer.', 'Precision Medicine in Bladder Cancer: Present Challenges and Future Directions.', 'Diagnostic accuracy of cystoscopic biopsy for tumour grade in outpatients with urothelial carcinoma of the bladder and the risk factors of upgrading.', 'KLRF1, a novel marker of CD56bright NK cells, predicts improved survival for patients with locally advanced bladder cancer.', 'Neoadjuvant Treatment in Muscle-Invasive Bladder Cancer: From the Beginning to the Latest Developments.']"""

We investigated differences in normal-organ biodistribution and uptake variability between the two most commonly PSMA tracers in clinical use, 68Ga-PSMA-11 and 18F-DCFPyL.  Methods:   This retrospective analysis included 34 patients with low tumor burden referred for PET/CT imaging with 68Ga-PSMA-11 and subsequently 18F-DCFPyL. Images were acquired with 4 cross-calibrated PET/CT systems. Volumes of interest were placed on major salivary and lacrimal glands, liver, spleen, duodenum, kidneys, bladder, blood-pool and muscle. Normal-organ biodistribution of both tracers was then quantified as SUVpeak and compared using paired tests, linear regression and Bland-Altman analysis. Between-patient variability was also assessed. Clinical and protocol variables were investigated for possible interference.  Results:   For both tracers the highest uptake was found in the kidneys and bladder and low background activity was noted across all scans. In the quantitative analysis there was significantly higher uptake of 68Ga-PSMA-11 in the kidneys, spleen and major salivary glands (p < 0.001), while the liver exhibited slightly higher 18F-DCFPyL uptake (p = 0.001, mean bias 0.79 ± 1.30). The lowest solid-organ uptake variability was found in the liver (COV 21.9% for 68Ga-PSMA-11, 22.5% for 18F-DCFPyL). There was a weak correlation between 18F-DCFPyL uptake time and liver SUVpeak (r = 0.488, p = 0.003) and, accordingly, patients scanned at later time-points had a larger mean bias between the two tracers' liver uptake values (0.05 vs 1.46, p = 0.001).  Conclusion:   Normal tissue biodistribution patterns of 68Ga-PSMA-11 and 18F-DCFPyL were similar, despite subtle differences in quantitative values.

Methods:   This retrospective study analyzed 1275 RPs performed between January 1992 and December 2013 in two university centers in Marseille (France). The inclusion criteria were: follow-up > 24 months, undetectable postoperative prostate-specific antigen (PSA), no seminal vesicle (SV) invasion, no lymph node invasion confirmed by surgery (pN0) or imaging (pNx), and no neoadjuvant or adjuvant treatment. BR was defined by PSA level ≥ 0.2 ng/mL on two successive samples. We included 189 patients, divided into two groups: - Focal PSM (fPSM): single PSM (sPSM) ≤3 mm; - Extensive PSM (ePSM): sPSM with linear length > 3 mm or several margins regardless of the length.  Results:   The median follow-up was 101 months (18-283) and the median age was 63 years (46-76). BR occurred in only 12.1% (14/115) of cases involving fPSM and in 54.1% (40/74) of cases involving ePSM. In the multivariate model, ePSM patients were significantly associated with increased BR compared to fPSM (hazard ratio [HR] = 6.11; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 3.25-11.49). The ePSM significantly decreased BR-free survival (p < 0.001) for every patient and every subgroup (pT2, pT3a, pG ≤6, and pG ≥7). The median BR time following RP was significantly shorter for ePSM patients than fPSM (57.2 vs. 89.2 months p < 0.001).  Conclusion:   With a median 8-year follow-up, ePSM was strongly associated with BR compared to fPSM. Therefore, it seems legitimate to monitor patients with fPSM.

It is difficult to thorough cure due to drug resistance and the high possibility of metastasis. SM934 is a novel water-soluble artemisinin analog, and has been reported to have a promising therapeutic effect on multiple autoimmune diseases. In this study, SM934 was combined with Testosterone, which is related to prostate cancer, and the reaction product was SM934-Testosterone. We aimed to explore whether SM934, Testosterone and SM934-Testosterone could inhibit tumorigenesis and metastasis of breast cancer cells. Moreover, the mechanism also remains to be clarified. The results of our study showed that among the three compounds, only SM934-Testosterone treatment could lead to the suppression of cell proliferation and metastasis with IC50 = 30.66 ± 2.13 μM at 24 h in MDA-MB-231 and IC50 = 31.11 ± 1.79 μM at 24 h in SK-BR-3, where apoptosis was induced. But SM934-Testosterone showed little effects on breast cancer in vivo due to its poor water-solubility. Furthermore, computational target prediction and experimental validation demonstrated that Cathepsin K was the target of SM934-Testosterone. SM934-Testosterone inhibited the expression of Cathepsin K in breast cancer cells.

Bioactive molecules from diets are promising to cure cancer by modulating epigenetic marks and changing immune response. These compounds specifically target the activity of DNMTs and HDACs to cure various human cancers. In view of this, we investigated the anticancer and epigenetic regulatory activities of an edible-plant Paederia foetida. The efficacy of methanolic extract of P. foetida leaves (MEPL) was tested for the modulation of epigenetic factors in gene silencing, i.e. DNMT and HDAC and expression pattern of certain tumor-suppressor genes. After treatment of prostate cancer cells (PC-3 and DU-145) with MEPL, lupeol and β-sitosterol; induction of apoptosis, decrease in cellular-viability and inhibition of cellular-migration were noticed. Simultaneously there was inhibition of DNMT1, HDACs and pro-inflammatory, IL-6, IL1-β, TNF-α and anti-inflammatory, IL-10 genes in cancer and THP1 cell lines. The DNMT1 protein content, enzyme activity and Bcl2 expression decreased significantly; however, expression of E-cadherin (CDH1) and pro-apoptotic gene Bax increased significantly after the treatment of cells with drugs.

We sought to quantify these competing risks using the probability that the cancer was over diagnosed, ie would not have been clinically diagnosed (diagnosed without screening) during the remaining lifetime of the patient.  Materials and methods:   Using an established model of prostate cancer screening and clinical diagnosis we simulated screen detected cases and determined whether a modeled clinical diagnosis would occur before noncancer death. Time of noncancer death was based on comorbidity adjusted population lifetables. Logistic regression models were fitted to the simulated data and used to estimate over diagnosis probabilities given patient age, prostate specific antigen level, Gleason sum and comorbidity category. An online calculator was developed to communicate over diagnosis estimates. Face validity and ease of use were assessed by surveying 32 clinical experts.  Results:   Estimated probabilities of over diagnosis ranged from 4% to 78% across clinicopathological variables and comorbidity status. When ignoring comorbidity, the estimated probability of over diagnosis in a 70-year-old man with prostate specific antigen 9.4 ng/ml and Gleason 6 was 34%. With severe comorbidities the estimate increased to 51%. Such a personalization may help inform the choice between active surveillance and definitive treatment. Based on responses from 20 of 32 experts we modified the explanation of over diagnosis for the online calculator and the input method for comorbid conditions.  Conclusions:   The probability of over diagnosis is strongly influenced by comorbidity status in addition to age. Personalized estimates incorporating comorbidity may contribute to shared decision making between patients and providers regarding personalized treatment selection.""","""['Roman Gulati', 'Sarah P Psutka', 'Ruth Etzioni']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""J Urol""","""['Editorial Comment.', 'Re: Personalized Risks of Over Diagnosis for Screen Detected Prostate Cancer Incorporating Patient Comorbidities: Estimation and CommunicationR.

The ProtecT (Prostate Testing for Cancer and Treatment) trial demonstrated no difference in survival in patients randomized to active surveillance, external beam radiotherapy or radical prostatectomy. We compared cost-effectiveness among the arms of ProtecT.  Materials and methods:   Using a Markov model we compared the cost-effectiveness of active surveillance, radical prostatectomy and external beam radiotherapy based on ProtecT outcomes, specifically 6-year quality of life data and 10-year oncologic data. Costs were based on 2017 Medicare reimbursement while utility values were assigned using the literature. Univariable and multivariable sensitivity analyses were performed.  Results:   Six years after randomization the mean costs per patient were $12,143 for active surveillance, $17,781 for radical prostatectomy and $29,238 for external beam radiotherapy. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio relative to active surveillance was $127,752/QALY for radical prostatectomy and $381,894/QALY for external beam radiotherapy. Ten years after randomization radical prostatectomy ($5,627/QALY) and external beam radiotherapy ($78,291/QALY) were more cost-effective than active surveillance. The model was sensitive to the metastasis rate on active surveillance with a threshold of 2.4% at 10 years, below which active surveillance was more cost-effective than radical prostatectomy. On multivariable sensitivity analysis at 10 years using a willingness to pay threshold of $100,000/QALY the most cost-effective strategy was radical prostatectomy in 45% of model microsimulations, external beam radiotherapy in 30% and active surveillance in 25%.  Conclusions:   Although active surveillance represents a cost-effective strategy to manage localized prostate cancer during the initial several years after diagnosis, the relative cost-effectiveness of treatment emerges with extended followup.""","""['Vidit Sharma#', 'Kevin M Wymer#', 'Bijan J Borah', 'Daniel A Barocas', 'R Houston Thompson', 'R Jeffrey Karnes', 'Stephen A Boorjian']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""J Urol""","""['Editorial Comment.', 'Active surveillance vs. treatment for low-risk prostate cancer: a cost comparison.', 'Modelling the lifetime cost-effectiveness of radical prostatectomy, radiotherapy and active monitoring for men with clinically localised prostate cancer from median 10-year outcomes in the ProtecT randomised trial.', 'Economic evaluation of treatments for patients with localized prostate cancer in Europe: a systematic review.', 'Cost of New Technologies in Prostate Cancer Treatment: Systematic Review of Costs and Cost Effectiveness of Robotic-assisted Laparoscopic Prostatectomy, Intensity-modulated Radiotherapy, and Proton Beam Therapy.', 'Maximizing resources in the local treatment of prostate cancer: A summary of cost-effectiveness studies.', 'Socioeconomic determinants are associated with the utilization and outcomes of active surveillance or watchful waiting in favorable-risk prostate cancer.', 'Listening to the Patient Voice Adds Value to Cancer Clinical Trials.', 'Economic Evaluation of Urine-Based or Magnetic Resonance Imaging Reflex Tests in Men With Intermediate Prostate-Specific Antigen Levels in the United States.', 'Active Surveillance Strategies for Low-Grade Prostate Cancer: Comparative Benefits and Cost-effectiveness.', 'Measuring Quality of Life Following Robot-Assisted Radical Prostatectomy.']"""

We began routinely offering same day discharge from the hospital after robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy. We evaluated the success rate, safety and cost implications in what is to our knowledge the only large series of same day discharge to date.  Materials and methods:   Beginning in September 2016 all patients were given the option of same day discharge without it being mandated. After allowing 3 months to solidify the protocol we evaluated our prospective database for the next 500 patients.  Results:   Of the 500 consecutive men who underwent robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy performed by 1 surgeon in 18 months 246 (49.2%) were discharged home the day of surgery and all of the remaining 254 were discharged the next day for a mean 0.51-day length of stay. Mean patient age was 62 years (range 42 to 81) and mean body mass index was 29.7 kg/m2 (range 20 to 53). Of the patients 34 (6.8%) had a Clavien-Dindo grade I-III complication within 90 days but there were no grade IV-V complications. Only 5 patients (1%) required an emergency department visit and only 8 (1.6%) required readmission. Only 1 of the patients who elected same day discharge was rehospitalized and only 1 presented to the emergency department. The estimated charge for an overnight stay at our institution is $2,109. The approximate reduction in charges was $518,814 during 18 months ($345,876 per year) with no increased cost due to emergency department visits or hospital readmissions compared with that of overnight patients. In the most recent 100 patients the rate of same day discharge improved to 65%.  Conclusions:   Same day discharge following robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy can be safely routinely offered with no increase in readmissions or emergency visits.

Methods:   A three-dimensional (3D) Convolutional Neural Network was trained for automatic bladder segmentation of the computed tomography (CT) scans. The automatic bladder segmentation alongside the computed tomography (CT) scan is jointly optimized to add explicit knowledge about the underlying anatomy to the registration algorithm. We included three datasets from different institutes and CT manufacturers. The first was used for training and testing the ConvNet, where the second and the third were used for evaluation of the proposed pipeline. The system performance was quantified geometrically using the dice similarity coefficient (DSC), the mean surface distance (MSD), and the 95% Hausdorff distance (HD). The propagated contours were validated clinically through generating the associated IMPT plans and compare it with the IMPT plans based on the manual delineations. Propagated contours were considered clinically acceptable if their treatment plans met the dosimetric coverage constraints on the manual contours.  Results:   The bladder segmentation network achieved a DSC of 88% and 82% on the test datasets. The proposed registration pipeline achieved a MSD of 1.29 ± 0.39, 1.48 ± 1.16, and 1.49 ± 0.44 mm for the prostate, seminal vesicles, and lymph nodes, respectively, on the second dataset and a MSD of 2.31 ± 1.92 and 1.76 ± 1.39 mm for the prostate and seminal vesicles on the third dataset. The automatically propagated contours met the dose coverage constraints in 86%, 91%, and 99% of the cases for the prostate, seminal vesicles, and lymph nodes, respectively. A Conservative Success Rate (CSR) of 80% was obtained, compared to 65% when only using intensity-based registration.  Conclusion:   The proposed registration pipeline obtained highly promising results for generating treatment plans adapted to the daily anatomy. With 80% of the automatically generated treatment plans directly usable without manual correction, a substantial improvement in system robustness was reached compared to a previous approach. The proposed method therefore facilitates more precise proton therapy of prostate cancer, potentially leading to fewer treatment-related adverse side effects.""","""['Mohamed S Elmahdy', 'Thyrza Jagt', 'Roel Th Zinkstok', 'Yuchuan Qiao', 'Rahil Shahzad', 'Hessam Sokooti', 'Sahar Yousefi', 'Luca Incrocci', 'C A M Marijnen', 'Mischa Hoogeman', 'Marius Staring']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Evaluation of an Open Source Registration Package for Automatic Contour Propagation in Online Adaptive Intensity-Modulated Proton Therapy of Prostate Cancer.', 'Evaluation of a commercial DIR platform for contour propagation in prostate cancer patients treated with IMRT/VMAT.', 'Fast contour propagation for MR-guided prostate radiotherapy using convolutional neural networks.', 'Automatic Segmentation of Multiple Organs on 3D CT Images by Using Deep Learning Approaches.', 'A deep learning-based approach to automatic proximal femur segmentation in quantitative CT images.', 'An Unsupervised Learning-Based Regional Deformable Model for Automated Multi-Organ Contour Propagation.', 'Integrating Structure Propagation Uncertainties in the Optimization of Online Adaptive Proton Therapy Plans.', 'Patient specific deep learning based segmentation for magnetic resonance guided prostate radiotherapy.', 'A Survey on Deep Learning for Precision Oncology.', 'Deep Learning for Per-Fraction Automatic Segmentation of Gross Tumor Volume (GTV) and Organs at Risk (OARs) in Adaptive Radiotherapy of Cervical Cancer.']"""

With a new near-infrared time-resolved spectroscopy device, the tNIRS-1, we can measure the absolute value of the cerebral hemoglobin concentration and hence calculate CBV and cerebral oxygen saturation (rSO2). Using this device, we evaluated the time course of CBV during surgery and also evaluated the changes in rSO2 simultaneously. Materials and Methods: We performed a prospective observational study of 21 patients scheduled for RARP. We evaluated CBV and rSO2 by using the tNIRS-1 at 10 time points during surgery. Results: The CBV was 2.92 ± 0.38 mL ·100 g-1 after the end of anesthetic preparation. It significantly increased to 3.05 ± 0.44 mL ·100 g-1 after the head-down tilt and was around 3.1 mL ·100 g-1 until 120 minutes after the head-down tilt. However, just before the return to the horizontal position, it decreased to 2.93 ± 0.46 mL ·100 g-1 and then decreased more after the return to the horizontal position. Changes in rSO2 over time were within only 3%, and no significant differences from the control value were observed. Conclusions: The increase in CBV was <10% despite the steep head-down tilt and pneumoperitoneum, and it was compensated for at around the end of surgery.

Cullin 4B (CUL4B) is a member of the ubiquitin E3 ligase family and overexpressed in several solid malignancies including PCa. CUL4B has been suggested to be an oncogene through epigenetic repression of tumor suppressors. However, the link between CUL4B expression and cancer stem-like phenotype remains unclear.  Methods:   Western blot analysis, sphere formation, and colony formation assays were used to examine the effect of CUL4B on cancer stem-like traits in PCa cells. Mechanically, bioinformatic analysis was utilized to evaluate whether BMI1 was a target of CUL4B. Moreover, real-time polymerase chain reaction, chromatin immunoprecipitation, and luciferase reporter assays were performed to identify microRNAs regulated by CUL4B. Finally, Western blot assay was used to validate the regulation of CUL4B, miR200b, and miR200c (miR200b/c) on the stem-like characteristics of PCa cells.  Results:   CUL4B promotes PCa pluripotency-associated markers expression, sphere formation, and anchorage-independent growth ability in vitro. Mechanically, CUL4B upregulates BMI1 expression via epigenetically repressing miR200b/c expression. In addition, miR200b/c could partially reverse CUL4B-induced BMI1 and pluripotency-associated marker expression.

Recent studies in a European cohort showed that expression of p16 is correlated with expression of the TMPRSS2/ERG (T/E) fusion protein. The T/E fusion is significantly less common in PCas in African American (AA) men. Thus, it would be predicted that p16 expression should be less common in PCas in AA men. We, therefore, sought to compare the expression of p16 in benign prostate and PCas from AA and European American (EA) men.  Methods:   Immunohistochemistry for p16 and ERG was performed on tissue microarrays constructed from radical prostatectomies performed on AA and EA veterans. Staining was scored and the scores compared with demographic, clinical and pathological parameters. Percent of West African ancestry in the AA cohort was assessed using ancestry informative markers.  Results:   Contrary to our predictions, p16 expression was similar in the cancers in the AA and EA cohorts. Consistent with prior reports, expression of p16 was quite low in benign prostate tissues from EA patients but surprisingly was significantly higher in benign tissues from AA patients. Expression of p16 was significantly associated with a family history of PCa in AA men. In addition, p16 was associated with ERG expression in AA PCa.  Conclusions:   While overall expression of p16 is similar in PCas from the two racial groups, the expression of p16 in benign tissues from a subset of AA men and the stronger correlation with ERG expression implies that there are different mechanisms for p16 overexpression in PCas from the two racial groups.""","""['Myra Wong', 'Yaeli Bierman', 'Curtis Pettaway', 'Rick Kittles', 'Martha Mims', 'Jeffrey Jones', 'Michael Ittmann']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Prevalence and Prognostic Significance of PTEN Loss in African-American and European-American Men Undergoing Radical Prostatectomy.', 'SPINK1 expression is enriched in African American prostate cancer but is not associated with altered immune infiltration or oncologic outcomes post-prostatectomy.', 'TMPRSS2-ERG gene fusion prevalence and class are significantly different in prostate cancer of Caucasian, African-American and Japanese patients.', 'TMPRSS2:ERG Gene Fusions in Prostate Cancer of West African Men and a Meta-Analysis of Racial Differences.', 'Genomic, epigenomic, and transcriptomic signatures of prostate cancer between African American and European American patients.', 'Ancestry: How researchers use it and what they mean by it.', 'The Prostate Cancer Androgen Receptor Cistrome in African American Men Associates with Upregulation of Lipid Metabolism and Immune Response.', 'Immunohistochemical expression of Cyclin D1 among Sudanese patients diagnosed with benign and malignant prostatic lesions.', 'Targeting the TMPRSS2/ERG fusion mRNA using liposomal nanovectors enhances docetaxel treatment in prostate cancer.']"""

The goal of this study was to determine if somatic alteration detected by PTEN immunohistochemical loss of expression is associated with specific histologic features.  Methods:   Two hundred sixty prostate core needle biopsies with PCa were assessed for PTEN loss using an analytically validated immunohistochemical assay. Blinded to PTEN status, each tumor was assessed for the Grade Group (GG) and the presence or absence of nine epithelial features. Presence of stromogenic PCa was also assessed and defined as grade 3 reactive tumor stroma as previously described: the presence of carcinoma associated stromal response with epithelial to stroma ratio of greater than 50% reactive stroma.  Results:   Eight-eight (34%) cases exhibited PTEN loss while 172 (66%) had intact PTEN. PTEN loss was significantly (P < 0.05) associated with increasing GG, poorly formed glands (74% of total cases with loss vs 49% of intact), and three well-validated unfavorable pathological features: intraductal carcinoma of the prostate (IDC-P) (69% of total cases with loss vs 12% of intact), cribriform Gleason pattern 4 (38% of total cases with loss vs 10% of intact) and stromogenic PCa (23% of total cases with loss vs 6% of intact). IDC-P had the highest relative risk (4.993, 95% confidence interval, 3.451-7.223, P < 0.001) for PTEN loss. At least one of these three unfavorable pathological features were present in 67% of PCa exhibiting PTEN loss, while only 11% of PCa exhibited PTEN loss when none of these three unfavorable pathological features were present.

The cells expressed Panx1 at the mRNA level, and released ATP in a manner that could be reduced by treatment with the Panx1 inhibitors carbenoxolone and mefloquine and the Panx1 substrate SR101. However, no significant effects of these compounds upon the uptake or hydrolysis of exogenously applied AEA was seen. Uptake by T84 cells of the other main endocannabinoid 2-arachidonoylglycerol and the AEA homologue palmitoylethanolamide was similarly not affected by carbenoxolone or mefloquine. Total release of tritium from [3H]AEA-prelabelled T84 cells over 10 min was increased, rather than inhibited by carbenoxolone and mefloquine. Finally, AEA uptake by PC3 prostate cancer and SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells, which express functional Panx1 channels, was not inhibited by carbenoxolone.

In prostate cancer cells, AR adaptations that arise in response to ADT are not singular, but diverse, and include gene amplification, mutation, and even complete loss of receptor expression. Collectively, each of these AR adaptations contributes to a complex, heterogeneous, ADT-resistant tumor. Here, we examined prostate cancer cell lines that model common castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) subtypes, each with different AR composition, and focused on novel regulators of tumor progression, the Bromodomain and Extraterminal (BET) family of proteins. We found that BRD4 regulates cell migration across all models of CRPC, regardless of aggressiveness and AR status, whereas BRD2 and BRD3 only regulate migration and invasion in less aggressive models that retain AR expression or signaling. BRD4, a coregulator of gene transcription, controls migration and invasion through transcription of AHNAK, a large scaffolding protein linked to promotion of metastasis in a diverse set of cancers. Furthermore, treatment of CRPC cell lines with low doses of MZ1, a small-molecule, BRD4-selective degrader, inhibits metastatic potential. Overall, these results reveal a novel BRD4-AHNAK pathway that may be targetable to treat metastatic CRPC (mCRPC). IMPLICATIONS: BRD4 functions as the dominant regulator of CRPC cell migration and invasion through direct transcriptional regulation of AHNAK, which together offer a novel targetable pathway to treat metastatic CRPC.Visual Overview: http://mcr.aacrjournals.org/content/molcanres/17/8/1627/F1.large.jpg.""","""['Jordan S Shafran', 'Guillaume P Andrieu', 'Balázs Györffy', 'Gerald V Denis']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Mol Cancer Res""","""['BRD4 regulates key transcription factors that drive epithelial-mesenchymal transition in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Targeting the BRD4-HOXB13 Coregulated Transcriptional Networks with Bromodomain-Kinase Inhibitors to Suppress Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Targeting Bromodomain and Extra-Terminal (BET) Family Proteins in Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer (CRPC).', 'Androgen receptor-dependent and -independent mechanisms driving prostate cancer progression: Opportunities for therapeutic targeting from multiple angles.', 'ZBTB46, SPDEF, and ETV6: Novel Potential Biomarkers and Therapeutic Targets in Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Integrated high-throughput analysis identifies super enhancers in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'BET inhibitor trotabresib in heavily pretreated patients with solid tumors and diffuse large B-cell lymphomas.', 'Role of transcription factors and chromatin modifiers in driving lineage reprogramming in treatment-induced neuroendocrine prostate cancer.', 'Novel plasma exosome biomarkers for prostate cancer progression in co-morbid metabolic disease.', 'Trotabresib, an oral potent bromodomain and extraterminal inhibitor, in patients with high-grade gliomas: A phase I, ""window-of-opportunity"" study.']"""

Methods and materials:   Sixty-one patients were treated with a single 15-Gy MRI-guided high-dose-rate brachytherapy followed by external beam radiotherapy as part of a prospective Phase II trial. The BN was delineated in retrospect on T2-weighted images. AUT and uHRQoL data were collected prospectively using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.0 and the expanded prostate index composite. A minimally important difference (MID) was defined as a deterioration of uHRQoL scores at 3 months ≥ 0.5 standard deviation of baseline score. Linear and logistic regression models were used.  Results:   The median BN volume was 0.6 cc. The median BN and urethral maximum dose (BNDmax and UDmax) were 22 Gy and 20 Gy, respectively. BNDmax was significantly associated with UDmax (p = 0.03). AUT Grade 2 + was observed in 32% of patients. Among those, 4 patients had an acute urinary retention (AUR). No Grade 4 + toxicity was reported. At 3 months, 47% of patients reported an MID in urinary uHRQoL. None of the dosimetric parameters including BNDmax was associated with acute Grade 2 + urinary toxicity or MID. However, 3 of 4 patients with AUR had a BNDmax in the highest quartile; >175% of prescription dose.

In addition, it examines the effect of source-decay-induced BED variation for patients treated at different time points in a source exchange cycle.  Materials and methods:   Current fractionation schemes are based on simplified-form BED = nd(1 + d/(α/β)), which assumes that intrafraction repair, interfraction repair, and repopulation are negligible. We took accepted radiobiological parameters of Tk, Tp, and α from the recommendations of the AAPM TG-137, and recalculated the full-form BED. Fraction times were normalized to require 15 min for 20 Gy at 10 Ci. Calculations were carried out for both α/β = 1.5 and 3 Gy.  Results:   After accounting for intrafraction repair, interfraction repair, and/or repopulation, full-form BED calculations showed significant values, as compared with simplified-form BED. For 1-fraction 20 Gy fractionation, the full-form BED was only 64-82% of the simplified-form BED. Dose protraction effects were milder for smaller prescriptions (6 Gy/Fx), where full form was 87-94%. With regard to source decay, BED varied >20% for patients treated at the beginning and the end of a source exchange cycle for 20 Gy single-fraction prescription.  Conclusions:   Repair and repopulation can be significant in monotherapy high-dose-rate for prostate cancer. As fractionation schemes are established, the simplified BED calculation may not be appropriate. Investigators should consider evaluating BED as a range rather than a discrete value when presenting results unless source activity is explicitly incorporated as well.""","""['Christopher J Tien', 'David J Carlson', 'Ravinder Nath', 'Zhe Jay Chen']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Brachytherapy""","""['Clinical implications of incomplete repair parameters for rat spinal cord: the feasibility of large doses per fraction in PDR and HDR brachytherapy.', 'Acute genitourinary toxicity after high-dose-rate (HDR) brachytherapy combined with hypofractionated external-beam radiation therapy for localized prostate cancer: correlation between the urethral dose in HDR brachytherapy and the severity of acute genitourinary toxicity.', 'The optimal fraction size in high-dose-rate brachytherapy: dependency on tissue repair kinetics and low-dose rate.', 'The emerging role of high-dose-rate (HDR) brachytherapy as monotherapy for prostate cancer.', 'What is the ideal radiotherapy dose to treat prostate cancer?

Given the lack of randomized evidence, large comparative studies may be useful in guiding clinical decision-making.  Methods:   We queried the National Cancer Database for patients with unfavorable intermediate-risk prostate cancer, as defined by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network. We compared overall survival between patients treated with radical prostatectomy (RP), external beam radiation therapy (EBRT), brachytherapy, and EBRT plus brachytherapy (EBRT+BT) using Cox proportional hazards models and propensity score matching.  Results:   A total of 10,439 patients were analyzed. There was no statistically significant difference in overall survival between RP and EBRT+BT (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.24; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.58-2.65). RP was associated with higher survival when compared to EBRT (HR = 2.30, 95% CI 1.70-3.20) and brachytherapy (HR = 2.90, 95% CI 1.40-6.20).

In recent years, lineage-specific transcription factors have been associated with a variety of cancers. One such transcription factor possibly regulating cancer is RUNX2, the master gene of early and late osteogenesis. In thyroid and prostate cancer, it has been reported that RUNX2 regulates expression of genes important in tumor cell migration and invasion. In this study, we report on RUNX2/ p57 overexpression in 16 patients with primary non-small cell lung cancer and/or metastatic lung cancer associated with H3K27Ac at P1 gene promoter region. In some patients, H3K4Me3 enrichment was also detected, in addition to WDR5, MLL2, MLL4, and UTX enzyme recruitment, members of the COMPASS-LIKE complex. Moreover, transforming growth factor-β induced RUNX2/ p57 overexpression and specific RUNX2 knockdown supported a role for RUNX2 in epithelial mesenchymal transition, which was demonstrated through loss of function assays in adenocarcinoma A549 lung cancer cell line. Furthermore, RUNX2 increased expression of epithelial mesenchymal transition genes VIMENTIN, TWIST1, and SNAIL1, which reflected increased migratory capacity in lung adenocarcinoma cells.""","""['Angélica María Herreño', 'Andrea Carolina Ramírez', 'Viviana Paola Chaparro', 'María José Fernandez', 'Alejandra Cañas', 'Carlos Fabian Morantes', 'Olga María Moreno', 'Ricardo Elias Brugés', 'Juan Andrés Mejía', 'Fernando José Bustos', 'Martín Montecino', 'Adriana P Rojas']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Tumour Biol""","""['ERRATUM to Role of RUNX2 transcription factor in epithelial mesenchymal transition in non-small cell lung cancer: Epigenetic control of the RUNX2 P1 promoter.', 'Knockdown of Nemo‑like kinase promotes metastasis in non‑small‑cell lung cancer.', 'Mll-COMPASS complexes mediate H3K4me3 enrichment and transcription of the osteoblast master gene Runx2/p57 in osteoblasts.', 'Downregulation of the TGFβ Pseudoreceptor BAMBI in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Enhances TGFβ Signaling and Invasion.', 'Epithelial Mesenchymal Transition in Aggressive Lung Cancers.', 'RUNX2 in mammary gland development and breast cancer.', 'Identification of the Transcriptional Regulatory Role of RUNX2 by Network Analysis in Lung Cancer Cells.', 'Regulatory Role of the RUNX2 Transcription Factor in Lung Cancer Apoptosis.', 'Suppression of Calcium Entry Modulates the Expression of TRβ1 and Runx2 in Thyroid Cancer Cells, Two Transcription Factors That Regulate Invasion, Proliferation and Thyroid-Specific Protein Levels.', 'RUNX Proteins as Epigenetic Modulators in Cancer.', 'Variant Enrichment Analysis to Explore Pathways Disruption in a Necropsy Series of Asbestos-Exposed Shipyard Workers.']"""

There is a growing scientific evidence for a protective role of G6PD deficiency against carcinogenesis. In this retrospective analysis, we tested the hypothesis that G6PD deficiency may reduce the risk of developing cancer in a tissue-specific manner. Material and methods: The study was conducted using data from 11,708 subjects undergoing gastrointestinal endoscopic procedures between 2002 and 2018 and tested for G6PD status in a teaching hospital of Northern Sardinia, Italy. Results: A 40% reduction of risk for cancer of endodermal origin was observed among G6PD-deficient patients compared with subjects with normal enzyme activity (relative risk (RR) 0.61, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.47-0.80) in both genders, confirmed by multivariable generalized linear regression after adjusting for age, sex, smoking habits, body mass index, diabetes and socio-economic status. The 'protective' effect of G6PD deficiency was larger for gastric cancer (RR 0.41, 95% CI 0.18-0.99), hepatocellular carcinoma (RR 0.48, 95% CI 0.26-0.92) and colorectal cancer (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.53-0.98), while a non-significant risk was observed for breast, prostate, lung, hematopoietic and metastases (primary site unknown). Conclusions: Our results suggest a reduced susceptibility to develop cancers, mostly of endodermal origin (stomach, colon and liver), but not of ectodermal/mesodermal origin, in carriers of G6PD deficiency. The effects of G6PD deficiency on carcinogenesis need further studies to better understand how cancer cells originating from different germ layers use pentose phosphate pathway to proliferate.""","""['Giovanni Mario Pes', 'Alessandra Errigo', 'Sara Soro', 'Nunzio Pio Longo', 'Maria Pina Dore']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Acta Oncol""","""['Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency and risk of colorectal cancer in Northern Sardinia: A retrospective observational study.', 'Is Glucose-6-Phosphate Dehydrogenase Deficiency a Risk Factor for Autoimmune Thyroid Disease?

We demonstrated the ability of 1 × 10-10 M NP to induce proliferation of LNCaP, S-phase progression, increase of ERα expression and its translocation from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. Moreover, we observed an up-regulation of key target genes involved in cell cycle and inflammation process. Particularly, after NP treatment, IL-8 and IL-1β mRNA levels are increased more than 50% indicating a major NP involvement in inflammation processes than E2.

This synergistic PTT/PDT/CT platform consists of three components: i) the Pluronic-polyethylenimine assembling into micelles to encapsulate drugs and providing reduction sites for gold cage formation through a ""green"" method, ii) the gold cage with surface plasmon resonance peak at near-infrared (NIR) region in a broad window qualifying the PTT/PDT potentiality, iii) a chemotherapeutic agent paclitaxel (PTX) arresting the tumor cell cycle. As demonstrated, the system has remarkable performance on controlling drug release, blocking TRPV6 cation channel, enhancing cell cycle arrest, elevating temperature and generating ROS, thus improving cellular toxicity along with apoptosis, enhancing tumor targeting, and achieving the therapy to ARPC with low toxicity on liver function and minimal side effects to normal organs. Notably, both PTT and PDT effect are generated under single irradiation situation because of the broad absorbance window, along with limited skin damages.

Methods and materials:   Six hundred thirty-six patients treated with SBRT for low- to intermediate-risk prostate cancer from 2009 to 2014 were included. Changes in testosterone and in sexual and hormonal domain scores on the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite-26 (EPIC) questionnaire over a 24-month period were evaluated via a 1-sided t test. EPIC score changes were evaluated in comparison with a distribution-based minimal clinically important difference threshold, wherein changes of greater than one half or greater than one third of the standard deviation in each domain were considered as medium-sized or small-sized effects, respectively.  Results:   Median and mean percent changes in testosterone at the 3- to 6-month, 7- to 12-month, 13- to 18-month, and 19- to 24-month time periods were -13.41% and -4.49% (P = .02); -12.23% and -2.77% (P = .13); -11.20% and -0.29% (P = .47); -5.00% and + 1.20% (P = .65). When analyzed after dividing the cohort into 3 groups based on baseline testosterone values using tertiles, testosterone tended to increase in patients in the first group and decrease in patients in the third group. Overall, the decline in EPIC hormonal domain scores never exceeded the threshold for a small-sized effect, though the decline in EPIC sexual domain scores did pass this threshold at the 19- to 24-month time period (mean 10.90 point decline). This decline was not present when groups were examined individually.  Conclusions:   In this large cohort of prospectively followed patients, there was a transient decline in testosterone shortly after SBRT that normalized by 24 months posttreatment. There was no significant change in EPIC hormonal domain scores. A significant decline in EPIC sexual domain scores, consistent with a small-sized clinically detectable difference, manifested between 19 and 24 months of follow-up. These results are consistent with testosterone decline patterns and sexual function changes seen after other forms of photon-based radiation therapy.""","""['Ye Yuan', 'Nima Aghdam', 'Christopher R King', 'Donald B Fuller', 'Julius Weng', 'Fang-I Chu', 'George Mardirossian', 'Ankur Patel', 'Nicholas G Nickols', 'Patrick A Kupelian', 'Michael L Steinberg', 'Sean P Collins', 'Amar U Kishan']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys""","""['Potency preservation following stereotactic body radiation therapy for prostate cancer.', 'Predictors of multidomain decline in health-related quality of life after stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) for prostate cancer.', 'Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy for Prostate Cancer: What is the Appropriate Patient-Reported Outcome for Clinical Trial Design?', 'Patient-reported outcomes following stereotactic body radiation therapy for clinically localized prostate cancer.', 'A systematic review of expanded prostate cancer index composite (EPIC) quality of life after surgery or radiation treatment.', 'Prostate cancer radiotherapy and incidental testicular irradiation: Impact on gonadal function.', 'The Long-Term Effect of Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy for Prostate Cancer on Testosterone Levels.', 'Proton therapy for prostate cancer: current state and future perspectives.', 'Changes in sexual function and serum testosterone levels in patients with prostate cancer after image-guided proton therapy.', 'Self-Reported Burden in Elderly Patients With Localized Prostate Cancer Treated With Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy (SBRT).']"""

Thus, development of new drugs for the treatment of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) is urgently needed. In this study, 25 novel derivatives of tanshinone IIA as potential androgen receptor (AR) suppression reagents for the treatment of CRPC have been synthesized. The inhibition on DHT-mediated AR transactivation and cell viability assay were performed to test the synthesized compounds. The results showed that among 25 new compounds, seven methoxy-substituted tanshinone IIA derivatives showed significant inhibition effect on DHT-mediated AR transactivation. In particular, TAN-24 that contains three methoxy groups showed the strongest inhibition effect on DHT-mediated AR transactivation. In addition, TAN-24 also suppressed DHT-AR transactivation more effectively than those of tanshinoneIIA and enzalutamide. In cytotoxicity against human prostate cancer cell lines assay, TAN-24 exhibited the most potent in vitro cytotoxicity against LNCaP and CWR22Rv1 cells, with IC50 values 20- and 19-times lower than those of tanshinone IIA and comparable to enzalutamide.

However, little is known about their potential overuse at the end of life. Cancer therapy use at the end of life has been considered an indicator of overtreatment. The study objective was to describe CRPC drug use in the last month of life of CRPC patients in Quebec.  Patients and methods:   Using administrative databases from the province of Quebec in Canada, we identified patients who received medical or surgical castration treatment, received one or more CRPC drugs (chemotherapy, abiraterone, or bone-targeted therapy), and died between 2001 and 2013. CRPC drug use in the last month of life was the primary outcome.  Results:   The cohort consisted of 1,148 patients with CRPC. A total of 316 men (27.5%) received a CRPC drug in the last month of life. For those who received chemotherapy, abiraterone, and bone-targeted therapy, 10.2%, 27.8%, and 31.8% received them in the last month of life, respectively. In multivariable analyses, age older than 75 years (odds ratio [OR], 0.75; 95% CI, 0.57 to 0.99), and prostate cancer diagnosis received less than 24 months earlier (OR, 0.43; 95% CI, 0.26 to 0.72) were associated with less CRPC drug use.

Whereas [225Ac]Ac-prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA)-617 alpha therapy showed no difference relative to the blood sample taken before treatment, beta therapy with [177Lu]Lu-PSMA-617 3 h post-injection revealed a small but significant increase in DNA strand breaks. In blood of patients who underwent positron emission tomography (PET) with either [18F]2-fluor-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) or [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11, an increase of DNA migration determined by the comet assay was not found when analysed at different time points (2-70 min) after intravenous tracer injection. Human whole blood was incubated with the targeted clinically relevant therapeutic radiopharmaceuticals [225Ac]Ac-PSMA-617, [177Lu]Lu-PSMA-617 and [90Y]Y-DOTA(0)-Phe(1)-Tyr(3)-octreotide (DOTA-TOC) at different activity concentrations (kBq/ml) for 5 days and then analysed by the comet assay. DNA damage increased with higher concentrations of all radiolabeled compounds tested. [177Lu]Lu-PSMA-617 caused higher blood cell radiotoxicity than equal activity concentrations of [90Y]Y-DOTA-TOC. Likewise, whole human blood was exposed to the positron emitters [18F]FDG and [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 in vitro for 24 h with activity concentrations ranging between 5 and 40 MBq/ml. The same activity concentration dependent elevated DNA migration was observed for both compounds although decay energies are different.

We aimed to establish clinically relevant biomarkers in African American men by studying ETS dependent gene expression patterns to identified race specific genes predictive of outcomes.  Materials and methods:   Two multicenter cohorts of a total of 1,427 men were used for the discovery and validation (635 and 792 men, respectively) of race specific predictive biomarkers. We used false discovery rate adjusted q values to identify race and ETS dependent genes which were differentially expressed in African American men who experienced biochemical recurrence within 5 years. Principal component modeling along with survival analysis was done to assess the accuracy of the gene panel in predicting recurrence.  Results:   We identified 3,047 genes which were differentially expressed based on ETS status. Of these genes 362 were differentially expressed in a race specific manner (false discovery rate 0.025 or less). A total of 81 genes were race specific and over expressed in African American men who experienced biochemical recurrence. The final gene panel included APOD, BCL6, EMP1, MYADM, SRGN and TIMP3. These genes were associated with 5-year biochemical recurrence (HR 1.97, 95% CI 1.27-3.06, p = 0.002) and they improved the predictive accuracy of clinicopathological variables only in African American men (60-month time dependent AUC 0.72).

However, many cancer survivors live with undiagnosed and untreated depression. Prostate cancer survivors may be particularly vulnerable, but little is known about their access to depression care. The goal of this study was to describe patterns and predictors of clinical diagnosis and treatment of depression in prostate cancer survivors.  Methods:   Generalized estimating equations were used to evaluate indicators of self-reported clinical diagnosis and treatment depression as a function of individual-level characteristics within a longitudinal dataset. The data were from a population-based cohort of North Carolinian prostate cancer survivors who were enrolled from 2004 to 2007 on the North Carolina-Louisiana Prostate Cancer Project (N = 1,031), and prospectively followed annually from 2008 to 2011 on the Health Care Access and Prostate Cancer Treatment in North Carolina (N = 805).  Results:   The average rate of self-reported clinical diagnosis of depression was 44% (95% CI: 39%-49%), which declined from 60% to 40% between prostate cancer diagnosis and 5-7 years later. Factors associated with lower odds of self-reported clinical diagnosis of depression include African-American race, employment, age at enrollment, low education, infrequent primary care visits, and living with a prostate cancer diagnosis for more than 2 years. The average rate of self-reported depression treatment was 62% (95% CI: 55%-69%). Factors associated with lower odds of self-reported depression treatment included employment and living with a prostate cancer diagnosis for 2 or more years.

The human positive cofactor 4 (PC4) is a transcriptional cofactor, and plays a potential role in cancer development. However, the significance and mechanism of PC4 in AIPC progression are unclear. By analyzing the clinical data, we find that PC4 is overexpressed in prostate cancer and closely correlated with the progression, metastasis and prognosis of patients. Additionally, PC4 is significantly upregulated in AIPC cells compared with ADPC cells, implying its importance in the development and progression of AIPC. Then, in vivo and in vitro studies reveal that loss of PC4 inhibits cell growth by suppressing c-Myc/P21 pathway and inducing cell cycle arrest at G1/S phase transition in AIPC. PC4 knockdown also attenuates EMT-mediated metastasis in AIPC. Moreover, for the first time, we find that PC4 exerts its oncogenic functions by promoting the expression of HIF-1α and activating β-catenin signaling. Therefore, our findings determine the signatures and molecular mechanisms of PC4 in AIPC, and indicate that PC4 might be a promising therapeutic target for AIPC.""","""['Peng Luo', 'Qingzhi Jiang', 'Qiang Fang', 'Yawei Wang', 'Ziwen Wang', 'Jing Yang', 'Xu Tan', 'Weibing Li', 'Chunmeng Shi']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Am J Cancer Res""","""['Transcriptional positive cofactor 4 promotes breast cancer proliferation and metastasis through c-Myc mediated Warburg effect.', 'Human Positive Coactivator 4 Affects the Progression and Prognosis of Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma via the mTOR/P70s6k Signaling Pathway.', 'Exosomal LINC01213 Plays a Role in the Transition of Androgen-Dependent Prostate Cancer Cells into Androgen-Independent Manners.', 'Implications of Bcl-2 and its interplay with other molecules and signaling pathways in prostate cancer progression.', 'Current opinions on the treatment of androgen-independent prostate cancer.', 'Distinct roles for the RNA-binding protein Staufen1 in prostate cancer.', 'PC4 serves as a negative regulator of skin wound healing in mice.', 'Silencing of ELK3 Induces S-M Phase Arrest and Apoptosis and Upregulates SERPINE1 Expression Reducing Migration in Prostate Cancer Cells.']"""

Results showed that crude hexane extract of C. speciosus (CHECS) inhibited proliferation, clonogenic and metastatic potential of PC-3 cells. It induced apoptosis in PC-3 cells associated with generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), reduction of GSH and permeabilization of mitochondrial and lysosomal membranes, induction of caspase-9/-3 activity and PARP-1 cleavage, DNA damage and an increase in ratio of Bax/Bcl-2 proteins.

In Africa, breast and prostate cancer in females and males, respectively, are the worst globally. However, biomarkers for their early detection and prognosis are not well developed. This study sought to investigate circulating cell-free DNA (ccfDNA) integrity and its potential utility as diagnostic and/or prognostic biomarker. Circulating cell-free DNA (ccfDNA) is degraded DNA fragments released into the blood plasma. In healthy individuals, the source of ccfDNA is solely apoptosis, producing evenly sized shorter DNA fragments. In cancer patients, however, necrosis produces uneven longer cell-free DNA fragments in addition to the shorter fragments originating from apoptosis. DNA integrity, expressed as the ratio of longer fragments to total DNA, may be clinically useful for the detection of breast and prostate cancer progression.  Methods:   Sixty-four (64) females, consisting of 32 breast cancer patients and 32 controls, and 61 males (31 prostate cancer patients and 30 controls) were included in the study.

Methods:   EZH2 expression was investigated using immunohistochemistry in diagnostic prostate biopsies of 113 prostate cancer patients treated with radiotherapy with curative intent. Associations between EZH2 expression in malignant and benign tissue in prostate biopsy cores and outcomes were investigated using univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses. LNCaP and PC3 cell radiosensitivity was investigated using colony formation and γH2AX assays following UNC1999 chemical probe-mediated EZH2 inhibition.  Results:   While there was no significant association between EZH2 expression and biochemical recurrence following radiotherapy, univariate analysis revealed that prostate cancer cytoplasmic and total EZH2 expression were significantly associated with metastasis development postradiotherapy (P = 0.034 and P = 0.003, respectively). On multivariate analysis, the prostate cancer total EZH2 expression score remained statistically significant (P = 0.003), while cytoplasmic EZH2 expression did not reach statistical significance (P = 0.053). No association was observed between normal adjacent prostate EZH2 expression and biochemical recurrence or metastasis. LNCaP and PC3 cell treatment with UNC1999 reduced histone H3 lysine 27 tri-methylation levels. Irradiation of LNCaP or PC3 cells with a single 2 Gy fraction with UNC1999-mediated EZH2 inhibition resulted in a statistically significant, though modest, reduction in cell colony number for both cell lines. Increased γH2AX foci were observed 24 hours after ionizing irradiation in LNCaP cells, but not in PC3, following UNC1999-mediated EZH2 inhibition vs controls.

Thus, we selected interleukin-8 (IL-8) as the bridge between inflammation and cancer cell oxidative stress-induced death and aimed to confirm its connection with mTOR and Glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta (GSK-3β).  Methods:   We overexpressed GSK-3β and observed its effect on reactive oxygen species (ROS) and oxidative stress-induced cell death. IL-8 was then upregulated or downregulated to determine its impact on preventing cell damage due to GSK-3β-induced oxidative stress. In addition, we overexpressed or knocked down mTOR to confirm its role in this process. Real-time PCR, Western blotting, transcription, Cell Counting Kit 8 (CCK-8), and flow cytometry analyses were performed in addition to the use of other techniques.  Results:   IL-8 promotes prostate cancer cell proliferation and decreases apoptosis, whereas GSK-3β activates the caspase-3 signaling pathway by increasing ROS and thereby induces oxidative stress-mediated cell death. In addition, mTOR can also decrease activation of the caspase-3 signaling pathway by inhibiting GSK-3 and thus decreasing ROS production. Moreover, the inhibitory effect of IL-8 on GSK-3β occurs through the regulation of mTOR.  Conclusion:   The results of this study highlight the importance of GSK-3β, which increases the production of ROS and thereby induces oxidative stress in tumor cells, whereas IL-8 and mTOR attenuate oxidative stress to protect prostate cancer cells through inhibition of GSK-3β.""","""['Yi Sun', 'Jian-Zhong Ai', 'Xi Jin', 'Liang-Ren Liu', 'Tian-Hai Lin', 'Hang Xu', 'Qiang Wei', 'Lu Yang']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['IL-8 protects prostate cancer cells from GSK-3β-induced oxidative stress by activating the mTOR signaling pathway.', 'Lithium promotes the production of reactive oxygen species via GSK-3β/TSC2/TOR signaling in the gill of zebrafish (Danio rerio).', 'Lithium chloride suppresses colorectal cancer cell survival and proliferation through ROS/GSK-3β/NF-κB signaling pathway.', 'GSK-3β at the crossroads in the signalling of heart preconditioning: implication of mTOR and Wnt pathways.', 'Substance P promotes the recovery of oxidative stress-damaged retinal pigmented epithelial cells by modulating Akt/GSK-3β signaling.', 'Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3β: A True Foe in Pancreatic Cancer.', 'Exploring the mTOR Signalling Pathway and Its Inhibitory Scope in Cancer.', 'Construction of Oxidative Stress-Related Genes Risk Model Predicts the Prognosis of Uterine Corpus Endometrial Cancer Patients.', 'Effects of Para-Toluenesulfonamide on Canine Melanoma Xenotransplants in a BALB/c Nude Mouse Model.', 'The Risk Model Based on the Three Oxidative Stress-Related Genes Evaluates the Prognosis of LAC Patients.', 'The paradoxical roles of miR-4295 in human cancer: Implications in pathogenesis and personalized medicine.']"""

Identifying predictive and/or prognostic biomarkers in the context of this rapidly expanding therapeutic armamentarium remains a pressing and unmet clinical need.  Objective:   To develop a prognostic whole-blood gene signature for mCRPC patients.  Design, setting, and participants:   As part of an ongoing prospective, multicentre biomarker research study (Australian Prostate Biomarker Alliance), we enrolled 115 mCRPC patients commencing chemotherapy (n = 34) or androgen receptor (AR) pathway inhibitors therapy (n = 81) and obtained pretreatment whole-blood samples in PAXgene RNA tubes. Gene expression was assessed using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Gene transcripts correlating with overall survival (OS) at p < 0.10 in univariate Cox regression models were incorporated into a multigene signature. Kaplan-Meier survival estimates and multivariate analyses were used to assess association with clinical outcomes. Prognostic strength of the signature was estimated using a concordance probability estimate (CPE).  Results and limitations:   Based on univariate analysis for OS, the following genes were incorporated into a multigene signature: AR splice variant 7 (AR-V7), and three androgen-regulated genes: GRHL2, HOXB13, and FOXA1. The number of positive transcripts clearly stratified survival outcomes (median OS: not reached vs 24.8 mo vs 16.2 mo for 0, 1, and ≥2 transcripts, respectively; p = 0.0052). Notably, this multigene signature retained prognostic significance on multivariable analysis (hazard ratio, 2.1; 95% confidence interval, 1.1-4.0; p = 0.019). Moreover, CPE for this model was 0.78, indicating strong discriminative capacity. Limitations include short follow-up time.  Conclusions:   Our data demonstrate the prognostic utility of a novel whole-blood AR-based signature in mCRPC patients commencing contemporary systemic therapies. Our pragmatic assay requires minimal processing, can be performed in most hospital laboratories, and could represent a key prognostic tool for risk stratification in mCRPC.

Our data revealed that Alternol treatment moderately increased mitochondrial superoxide formation rate, but it was significantly lower than the total ROS positive cell population. Pre-treatment with mitochondria-specific anti-oxidant MitoQ, NOX or NOS specific inhibitors had no protective effect on Alternol-induced ROS accumulation and cell death. However, XDH/XO inhibition by specific small chemical inhibitors or gene silencing reduced total ROS levels and protected cells from apoptosis induced by Alternol. Further analysis revealed that Alternol treatment significantly enhanced XDH oxidative activity and induced a strong protein oxidation-related damage in malignant but not benign cells. Interestingly, benign cells exerted a strong spike in anti-oxidant SOD and catalase activities compared to malignant cells after Alternol treatment.

Grades of CC-EMGs including NVB-triggered CC-EMG before prostate removal were associated with baseline five-item International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF-5) score (grades 0-1, 4.6±2.7; grade 2, 13.2±6.8; grades 3-4, 16.6±5.9; p=0.003). Furthermore, grades of CC-EMGs including NVB-triggered CC-EMG after prostate removal were significantly associated with potency recovery (grade 0, 12.5%; grade 1, 0%; grade 2, 33.3%; grades 3-4, 100% at 12 mo; p=0.005) and postoperative IIEF-5 scores at all evaluation time points (grades 0-1, 2.6±2.8; grade 2, 4.3±5.8; grades 3-4, 15.7±11.0 at 12 mo; p=0.003).  Conclusions:   We successfully established the protocol for safe intraoperative cavernous nerve monitoring and mapping using CC-EMG during RARP. Its grades were well correlated with erectile function.  Patient summary:   In this first-in-human feasibility study, we successfully established the protocol for safe intraoperative cavernous nerve monitoring and mapping method during robot-assisted radical prostatectomy. The results were significantly associated with erectile function. Evaluation of clinical efficacy to preserve potency seems worthy of further optimization and investigation in confirmatory clinical trials.""","""['Won Hoon Song', 'Ju Hyun Park', 'Bum Sik Tae', 'Sung-Min Kim', 'Min Hur', 'Jeong-Hwa Seo', 'Ja Hyeon Ku', 'Cheol Kwak', 'Hyeon Hoe Kim', 'Keewon Kim', 'Chang Wook Jeong']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Eur Urol""","""['Is this the ultimate solution to fight erectile dysfunction post radical prostatectomy?', 'Retrograde Release of the Neurovascular Bundle with Preservation of Dorsal Venous Complex During Robot-assisted Radical Prostatectomy: Optimizing Functional Outcomes.', 'A prediction model relating the extent of intraoperative fascia preservation to erectile dysfunction after nerve-sparing robot-assisted radical prostatectomy.', 'Nerve-sparing in salvage robot-assisted prostatectomy: surgical technique, oncological and functional outcomes at a single high-volume institution.', 'Comprehensive approach for preserving cavernous nerves and erectile function after radical prostatectomy in the era of robotic surgery.', 'Current status of various neurovascular bundle-sparing techniques in robot-assisted radical prostatectomy.', 'Infrared neural stimulation markedly enhances nerve functionality assessment during nerve monitoring.', 'Intraoperative Neurophysiology Monitoring for Spinal Dysraphism.', 'Is this the ultimate solution to fight erectile dysfunction post radical prostatectomy?']"""

Methods:   Within the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database (2004-2015), we identified PC patients who were either married (n = 326,664) or unmarried (n = 106,533). Temporal trends, cumulative incidence plots, as well as multivariable competing risks regression analyses focused on (1) the overall population, (2) D'Amico low-risk N0M0 PC, (3) D'Amico intermediate-risk N0M0 PC, (4) D'Amico high-risk N0M0 PC, (5) N1M0 PC, and (6) M1 PC patients.

Methods:   We conducted a retrospective analysis of 115 patients with CRPC treated with either abiraterone (n = 43) or enzalutamide (n = 72). A serum testosterone level was measured at time of starting of abiraterone or enzalutamide. We determined whether serum testosterone influenced the outcomes of androgen receptor (AR)-targeted therapy.  Results:   In the very-low testosterone group (<5 ng/dl), the rate of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response was significantly higher among patients treated with abiraterone compared to enzalutamide (62 vs. 32%, respectively; P = 0.033), with no difference in the low testosterone group (5-<50 ng/dl) (93 vs. 81%, respectively; P = 0.429). During the median follow-up of 26 months, PSA progression-free survival was significantly longer in the low testosterone group than in the very-low testosterone group (12.2 vs. 4.5 months, P<0.001). In the very-low testosterone group, enzalutamide use (HR 3.07, 95% CI 1.36-6.94; P = 0.007), primary androgen deprivation therapy <12 months (HR 2.50, 95% CI 1.23-5.08; P = 0.011) and bone metastases (HR 2.60, 95% CI 1.20-5.64; P = 0.015) were significantly associated with PSA progression.  Conclusion:   Patients with a serum testosterone level ≥5 ng/dl were more likely to receive therapeutic benefits from AR-targeted therapy compared to those with serum testosterone levels <5 ng/dl.

A total of 20 prostate patients were selected retrospectively and divided into 2 groups of VMAT plans using prescriptions of 60 Gy/20 fx and 79 Gy/38 fx. Inverse treatment planning optimized by the PO and PRO algorithm based on the dual-arc technique was carried out by the Eclipse treatment planning system. The maximum dose, minimum dose, mean dose, dose-volume points, and dose-volume indices of the targets and organs at risk (OAR) were calculated from the plans. In addition, radiobiological parameters such as tumor control probability (TCP), normal tissue complication probability (NTCP), and equivalent uniform dose (EUD) of the targets and OAR were determined based on their dose-volume histograms (DVHs). A paired Student's t-test was carried out to compare the difference between mean dose-volume points, radiobiological parameters, and dose-volume indices. Two-tailed p < 0.05 was defined as having statistical difference. For prostate VMAT plans optimized by the PO algorithm, equal or slightly larger mean dose and TCP of the PTV (1% for 60 Gy/20 fx and 0.2% for 78 Gy/39 fx) were found by comparing to the PRO. These were followed by finding the slightly larger conformity index (CI; 0.927 vs 0.895 and 0.910 vs 0.904), larger or equal homogeneity index (HI; 0.054 vs 0.052 and 0.058 vs 0.058), and smaller gradient index (GI; 1.366 vs 2.288 and 1.585 vs 1.742) of the PTV using plans optimized by the PO vs PRO using prescriptions of 60 Gy/20 fx and 78 Gy/39 fx. For the OAR, we found that the mean doses, NTCPs, and EUDs of the rectum, bladder, and femur were slightly larger for plans optimized by the PO algorithm compared to the PRO, though both optimization algorithms satisfied all the dose-volume criteria and objectives in the inverse planning. Both the PO and PRO algorithm can generate prostate VMAT plans fulfilling the required dose-volume criteria. It is concluded that plans optimized by the PO algorithm can produce prostate plan with very similar quality compared to PRO.""","""['James C L Chow', 'Runqing Jiang', 'Lu Xu']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Med Dosim""","""[]"""

Numerous advantages have been reported of adding non-coplanar beams to the treatment plan. The aim of this study was to compare current state-of-the-art VMAT and CyberKnife treatment plans to that of a novel linac design developed at Stanford which utilizes a static conical beam arrangement that allows the inclusion of a full ring diagnostic CT with shared isocenter with the treatment beams. Four clinical cases, prostate, lung, head/neck, and pediatric brain, were selected and treatment plans were generated with 45° or 60° (to the longitudinal axis of the patient) conical beam IMRT and compared with co-planar 90° VMAT plans. Double cone, with beams entering from both superior and inferior directions, and single cone geometries were evaluated. Plans were optimized in RayStation using an in-house developed script to minimize operator bias between the different techniques. Non-coplanar CyberKnife IMRT plans for the pediatric and prostate case were optimized separately in MultiPlan and compared to conical geometry plans. In the prostate case, increased mean dose to the rectum (2.3-3.7 Gy) and bladder (9.5-14.5 Gy) but decreased dose to the femoral heads (femurs) (7.1-10 Gy) were found with the conical arrangement compared to 90° VMAT. Only minor dosimetric differences were found in the lung case, while selective sparing of organs at risk was found with 45° or 60° conical arrangement in the pediatric brain and head/neck cases. For the prostate case, a reduction in mean doses to the bladder and rectum of 6% (2 Gy) and 18% (5.2 Gy), respectively, was found when comparing the CyberKnife to the 60° conical plan, in favor of the CyberKnife plan, but with an increase in integral dose and reduced conformity. An increase in integral dose and reduced conformity was also found for the pediatric brain case when comparing CyberKnife and 60° conical plan. Minor benefits were found with double cone compared to single cone geometry. Comparable treatment plan quality could be achieved between conical beam arrangement and 90° (coplanar) VMAT and CyberKnife (non-coplanar) IMRT, demonstrating the promise of this novel beam geometry.

The present study is towards understanding interaction between biological, lifestyle and genetic impacts of AKR1C3 and their influence on clinical factors in a prostate cancer (PC) cohort from New Zealand (NZ).  Method:   Characteristics of 516 PC patients were collected from the Auckland Regional Urology Facility, NZ. These men were genotyped for the AKR1C3 rs12529 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP). The leukocyte AKR1C3 activity was measured in a sub-cohort. Variability of leukocyte AKR1C3 activity between biological, lifestyle and clinical features as well as correlation between biological and clinical features were assessed with and without genetic stratification.  Results:   The leukocyte AKR1C3 activity was associated with age at diagnosis (0.51 vs 0.34 μM coumberol units for >69y vs ≤69y, P = 0.03); and with anatomic stage/prognostic grouping among the AKR1C3 rs12529 CC genotype carriers (0.50 vs 28 μM coumberol units among low- and high-risk groups respectively, P = 0.02).

Liver X receptors (LXRs) are nuclear receptors and important regulators of intracellular cholesterol and lipid homeostasis. Moreover, they have regulatory roles in both cancer and immune response. Indeed, they can regulate inflammation and innate and acquired immunity. Furthermore, LXR activation directly acts in cancer cells (e.g., prostate, breast, melanoma, colon cancer, hepatocarcinoma, glioblastoma, and MM) that show an accumulation of cholesterol and alteration of LXR-mediated metabolic pathways. Here, we investigated the role of LXR and cholesterol on the expression of the NK cell-activating ligands major histocompatibility complex class I chain-related molecule A and B (MICA and MICB) in MM cells. The results shown in this work indicate that MM cells are responsive to LXR activation, which induces changes in the intracellular cholesterol content. These changes correlate with an enhanced expression of MICA and MICB in human MM cell lines and in primary malignant plasma cells, 2 ligands of the NK group 2D receptor (NKG2D)/CD314 activating receptor expressed in cytotoxic lymphocytes, rendering MM cells more sensitive to recognition, degranulation, and killing by NK cells. Mechanistically, we observed that LXR activation regulates MICA and MICB expression at different levels: MICA at the transcriptional level, enhancing mica promoter activity, and MICB by inhibiting its degradation in lysosomes. The present study provides evidence that activation of LXR, by enhancing NKG2D ligand expression, can promote NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity and suggests a novel immune-mediated mechanism involving modulation of intracellular cholesterol levels in cancer cells.-Bilotta, M.

To address these limitations, the present work reports the engineering of circular bivalent aptamer-drug conjugates (cb-ApDCs). The cb-ApDCs exhibit high stability, specific recognition, excellent cellular uptake, and esterase-triggered release. Furthermore, the drug ratios in cb-ApDCs can be tuned for an enhanced synergistic effect without the need for complex chemistry. Therefore, cb-ApDCs provide a promising platform for the development of DCCT strategies for different drug combinations and ratios.""","""['Fang Zhou', 'Peng Wang', 'Yongbo Peng', 'Pengge Zhang', 'Qin Huang', 'Weidi Sun', 'Nongyue He', 'Ting Fu', 'Zilong Zhao', 'Xiaohong Fang', 'Weihong Tan']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Angew Chem Int Ed Engl""","""['Polymeric Engineering of Aptamer-Drug Conjugates for Targeted Cancer Therapy.', 'A basic insight into aptamer-drug conjugates (ApDCs).', 'Automated modular synthesis of aptamer-drug conjugates for targeted drug delivery.', 'Aptamer-Drug Conjugates.', 'Programmable Repurposing of Existing Drugs as Pharmaceutical Elements for the Construction of Aptamer-Drug Conjugates.', 'Recent progress of aptamer‒drug conjugates in cancer therapy.', 'A versatile strategy for convenient circular bivalent functional nucleic acids construction.', 'Robust Covalent Aptamer Strategy Enables Sensitive Detection and Enhanced Inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 Proteins.', 'Construction of nanocarriers based on nucleic acids and their applications in nanobiology delivery systems.', 'Calixarene-modified albumin for stoichiometric delivery of multiple drugs in combination-chemotherapy.']"""

Using GLMnet, we trained a novel multimarker model (miMe) comprising nine miRNAs and three methylation markers that predicted postoperative biochemical recurrence (BCR) independently of the established clinicopathological CAPRA-S nomogram in Cox multivariate regression analysis in Cohort 1 (HR [95% CI]: 1.53 [1.26-1.84], p < 0.001).

Molecular mechanisms of their selective activity against cancer cells are still underexplored. In this work, the impact of ITC on DNA replication and damage was compared between PC-3 prostate cancer cells and HDFa normal fibroblasts as well as PNT2 prostate epithelial cells.  Methods:   Cells were treated with sulforaphane or phenethyl isothiocyanate. [3H]thymidine incorporation and the level of histone γH2A.X were estimated as indicators of DNA replication and double-strand breaks (DSB), respectively. Levels of HDAC3, CtIP, and p-RPA were investigated by immunoblotting. Comet assay was performed to visualize DNA damage.  Results:   ITCs inhibited DNA replication in all tested cell lines, and this activity was independent of reactive oxygen species of mitochondrial origin. It was followed by DSB which were more pronounced in cancer than noncancerous cells. This difference was independent of HDAC activity which was decreased in both cell lines when treated with ITCs. On the other hand, it correlated with faster removal of DSB, and thus, transient activation of repair proteins in normal cells, while in PC-3 prostate cancer, cell DNA repair was significantly less effective.  Conclusion:   DNA damage induced by ITCs is a consequence of the block in DNA replication which is observed in both, cancer and normal cells. Selective antiproliferative activity of ITCs towards cancer cells results from less efficient DNA repair in cancer cells relative to normal cells.""","""['Aleksandra Hać', 'Joanna Brokowska', 'Estera Rintz', 'Michał Bartkowski', 'Grzegorz Węgrzyn', 'Anna Herman-Antosiewicz']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Eur J Nutr""","""['HDAC turnover, CtIP acetylation and dysregulated DNA damage signaling in colon cancer cells treated with sulforaphane and related dietary isothiocyanates.', 'Heterocyclic Analogs of Sulforaphane Trigger DNA Damage and Impede DNA Repair in Colon Cancer Cells: Interplay of HATs and HDACs.', 'The role of protein binding in induction of apoptosis by phenethyl isothiocyanate and sulforaphane in human non-small lung cancer cells.', 'Advances in Research of Antitumor Mechanisms of Isothiocyanates.', 'Anti-Carcinogenic Glucosinolates in Cruciferous Vegetables and Their Antagonistic Effects on Prevention of Cancers.', 'Reviewing the Prospective Pharmacological Potential of Isothiocyanates in Fight against Female-Specific Cancers.', 'Sulforaphane and Its Protective Role in Prostate Cancer: A Mechanistic Approach.', 'Sonicated Extract from the Aril of Momordica Cochinchinensis Inhibits Cell Proliferation and Migration in Aggressive Prostate Cancer Cells.', 'Glucosinolates and Omega-3 Fatty Acids from Mustard Seeds: Phytochemistry and Pharmacology.', 'Cruciferous Vegetables and Their Bioactive Metabolites: from Prevention to Novel Therapies of Colorectal Cancer.']"""

Outcomes:   Reported experience of screening, diagnosis and treatment decision making, and its impact on psychosocial well-being, life and personal circumstances.  Results:   Men's accounts revealed profound consequences of both prostate cancer diagnosis and resisting medical advice for treatment, with effects on their psychological well-being, family, employment circumstances, identity and life choices. Some of these men were tested for prostate-specific antigen without their knowledge or informed consent. The men felt uninformed about their management options and unsupported through treatment decision making. This often led them to develop a sense of disillusionment and distrust towards the medical profession and conventional medicine.

Methods:   A total of 357 patients who underwent prostate biopsy between January 2014 and December 2017 were included in this study. All patients had 3.0 T multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and complete laboratory examinations. PI-RADS v2 was used to assess the imaging. PSA, PSA density (PSAD), the free/total PSA ratio (f/t PSA) and the Gleason score (GS) were classified into four-tiered levels, and optimal weights were pursued on these managed levels to build a PCa accumulating model. A receiver operating characteristic curve was generated.  Results:   In all, 174 patients (48.7%) had benign prostatic hyperplasia, and 183 (51.3%) had PCa, among whom 149 (81.4%, 149/183) had clinically significant PCa.

Prostate cancer stem cells (PCSCs) are likely the responsible cell types for cancer initiation, clinical treatment failure, tumor relapse, and metastasis. Estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) is mainly expressed in the basal layer cells of the normal prostate gland and has key roles in coordinating stem cells to control prostate organ development. Here, we investigated the roles of the estrogen-ERα signaling pathway in regulating PCSCs.  Methods:   Correlation of CD49f and ERα/NOTCH1 was analyzed in human clinical datasets and tissue samples. Flow cytometry was used to sort CD49fHi and CD49fLow cells. EZH2 recruitment by ERα and facilitation of ERα binding to the NOTCH1 promoter was validated by Co-IP and ChIP. Primary tumor growth, tumor metastasis and sensitivity to 17β-estradiol (E2) inhibitor (tamoxifen) were evaluated in castrated mice.  Results:   ERα expression was significantly higher in CD49fHi prostate cancer basal stem-like cells (PCBSLCs), which showed basal and EMT features with susceptibility to E2 treatment. ERα-induced estrogen effects were suggested to drive the NOTCH1 signaling pathway activity via binding to the NOTCH1 promoter. Moreover, EZH2 was recruited by ERα and acted as a cofactor to assist ERα-induced estrogen effects in regulating NOTCH1 in PCa. In vivo, E2 promoted tumor formation and metastasis, which were inhibited by tamoxifen.  Conclusions:   Our results implicated CD49f+/ERα + prostate cancer cells associated with basal stem-like and EMT features, named EMT-PCBSLCs, in heightened potential for promoting metastasis. NOTCH1 was regulated by E2 in CD49fHi EMT-PCBSLCs.

Despite being clinically similar, some tumours are more likely to recur after surgery compared to others. Distinguishing those that need adjuvant or salvage radiotherapy will improve patient outcomes. The goal of this study was to identify circulating microRNA that could independently predict prostate cancer patient risk stratification after radical prostatectomy.  Methods:   Seventy-eight prostate cancer patients were recruited at the Odette Cancer Centre in Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre. All patients had previously undergone radical prostatectomy. Blood samples were collected simultaneously for PSA testing and miRNA analysis using NanoString nCounter technology. Of the 78 samples, 75 had acceptable miRNA quantity and quality. Patients were stratified into high- and low-risk categories based on Gleason score, pathological T stage, surgical margin status, and diagnostic PSA: patients with Gleason ≥ 8; pT3a and positive margin; pT3b and any margin; or diagnostic PSA > 20 µg/mL were classified as high-risk (n = 44) and all other patients were classified as low-risk (n = 31).  Results:   Using our patient dataset, we identified a four-miRNA signature (miR-17, miR-20a, miR-20b, miR-106a) that can distinguish high- and low-risk patients, in addition to their pathological tumour stage. High expression of these miRNAs is associated with shorter time to biochemical recurrence in the TCGA dataset. These miRNAs confer an aggressive phenotype upon overexpression in vitro.

TKIs are known to cause dimerization of EGFR without altering its expression level. Given the fact that EGFR possesses kinase-independent pro-survival function, the role of TKI-inactivated EGFR in cancer cell survival needs to be addressed. In this study, using wt-EGFR-expressing cancer cells A549 (lung), DU145 (prostate), PC3 (prostate), and MDA-MB-231 (breast), we characterized the TKI-induced dimerization status of EGFR and determined the dependency of cells on kinase-inactivated EGFR for survival. We report that TKI-induced EGFR dimerization is dependent on palmitoylation and independent of its kinase activity, and that mutations of the cysteine residues known to be critical for EGFR's palmitoylation abolished TKI-induced EGFR dimerization. Furthermore, TKI-induced EGFR dimerization is persistent in TKI-resistant cells, and inhibition of palmitoylation by 2-bromopalmitate, or targeted reduction of the kinase-inactivated EGFR by siRNA or by an EGFR-downregulating peptide, are lethal to TKI-resistant cancer cells.

Megalin expression is reduced in diseases associated with fibrosis, including diabetic nephropathy, hepatic fibrosis and cholelithiasis, as well as in some breast and prostate cancers. One of the hallmarks of these conditions is the presence of the cytokine transforming growth factor beta (TGF-ß). Although TGF-ß has been implicated in the reduction of megalin levels, the molecular mechanism underlying this regulation is not well understood. Here, we show that treatment of two epithelial cell lines (from kidney and gallbladder) with TGF-ß1 is associated with decreased megalin mRNA and protein levels, and that these effects are reversed by inhibiting the TGF-ß1 type I receptor (TGF-ßRI). Based on in silico analyses, the two SMAD-binding elements (SBEs) in the megalin promoter are located at positions -57 and -605. Site-directed mutagenesis of the SBEs and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) experiments revealed that SMAD2/3 transcription factors interact with SBEs. Both the presence of SMAD2/3 and intact SBEs were associated with repression of the megalin promoter, in the absence as well in the presence of TGF-ß1. Also, reduced megalin expression and promoter activation triggered by high concentration of albumin are dependent on the expression of SMAD2/3. Interestingly, the histone deacetylase inhibitor Trichostatin A (TSA), which induces megalin expression, reduced the effects of TGF-ß1 on megalin mRNA levels. These data show the significance of TGF-ß and the SMAD2/3 signalling pathway in the regulation of megalin and explain the decreased megalin levels observed under conditions in which TGF-ß is upregulated, including fibrosis-associated diseases and cancer.""","""['Felipe Cabezas', 'Pamela Farfán', 'María-Paz Marzolo']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['The transforming growth factor-beta/SMAD signaling pathway is present and functional in human mesangial cells.', 'Chromatin immunoprecipitation on microarray analysis of Smad2/3 binding sites reveals roles of ETS1 and TFAP2A in transforming growth factor beta signaling.', 'TGF-β induces miR-30d down-regulation and podocyte injury through Smad2/3 and HDAC3-associated transcriptional repression.', 'A tale of two proteins: differential roles and regulation of Smad2 and Smad3 in TGF-beta signaling.', 'Smad2 linker region phosphorylation is an autonomous cell signalling pathway: Implications for multiple disease pathologies.', ""LRP2 and DOCK8 Are Potential Antigens for mRNA Vaccine Development in Immunologically 'Cold' KIRC Tumours."", 'Participation of OCRL1, and APPL1, in the expression, proteolysis, phosphorylation and endosomal trafficking of megalin: Implications for Lowe Syndrome.', 'Andrographolide Inhibits Corneal Fibroblast to Myofibroblast Differentiation In Vitro.', 'Functional characterization of nutraceuticals using spectral clustering: Centrality of caveolae-mediated endocytosis for management of nitric oxide and vitamin D deficiencies and atherosclerosis.', 'The Upregulation of Caffeic Acid Phenethyl Ester on Growth Differentiation Factor 15 Inhibits Transforming Growth Factor β/Smad Signaling in Bladder Carcinoma Cells.']"""

Genetic reporters are needed to localize the molecular events inside these cells in patients. Specifically, a nonimmunogenic genetic reporter is urgently needed as current reporters are immunogenic due to derivation from nonhuman sources. Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) is potentially nonimmunogenic due to its natural, low-level expression in select tissues (self-MHC display). PSMA overexpression on human prostate adenocarcinoma is also visible with excellent contrast. We exploit these properties in a transduced, two-component, Human-Derived, Genetic, Positron-emitting, and Fluorescent (HD-GPF) reporter system. Mechanistically analogous to the luciferase and luciferin reporter, PSMA is genetically encoded into non-PSMA expressing 8505C cells and tracked with ACUPA-Cy3-BF3, a single, systemically injected small molecule that delivers positron emitting fluoride (18F) and a fluorophore (Cy3) to report on cells expressing PSMA. PSMA-lentivirus transduced tissues become visible by Cy3 fluorescence, [18F]-positron emission tomography (PET), and γ-scintillated biodistribution. HD-GPF fluorescence is visible at subcellular resolution, while a reduced PET background is achieved in vivo, due to rapid ACUPA-Cy3-BF3 renal excretion. Co-transduction with luciferase and GFP show specific advantages over popular genetic reporters in advanced murine models including, a ""mosaic"" model of solid-tumor intratumoral heterogeneity and a survival model for observing postsurgical recurrence. We report an advanced genetic reporter that tracks genetically modified cells in entire animals and with subcellular resolution with PET and fluorescence, respectively.

Objective:   To quantify the association of black race with long-term survival outcomes after controlling for known prognostic variables and access to care among men with prostate cancer.  Design, setting, and participants:   This multiple-cohort study included updated individual patient-level data of men with clinical T1-4N0-1M0 prostate cancer from the following 3 cohorts: Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER [n = 296 273]); 5 equal-access regional medical centers within the Veterans Affairs health system (VA [n = 3972]); and 4 pooled National Cancer Institute-sponsored Radiation Therapy Oncology Group phase 3 randomized clinical trials (RCTs [n = 5854]). Data were collected in the 3 cohorts from January 1, 1992, through December 31, 2013, and analyzed from April 27, 2017, through April 13, 2019.  Exposures:   In the VA and RCT cohorts, all patients received surgery and radiotherapy, respectively, with curative intent. In SEER, radical treatment, hormone therapy, or conservative management were received.  Main outcomes and measures:   Prostate cancer-specific mortality (PCSM). Secondary measures included other-cause mortality (OCM). To adjust for demographic-, cancer-, and treatment-related baseline differences, inverse probability weighting (IPW) was performed.  Results:   Among the 306 100 participants included in the analysis (mean [SD] age, 64.9 [8.9] years), black men constituted 52 840 patients (17.8%) in the SEER cohort, 1513 (38.1%) in the VA cohort, and 1129 (19.3%) in the RCT cohort. Black race was associated with an increased age-adjusted PCSM hazard (subdistribution hazard ratio [sHR], 1.30; 95% CI, 1.23-1.37; P < .001) within the SEER cohort. After IPW adjustment, black race was associated with a 0.5% (95% CI, 0.2%-0.9%) increase in PCSM at 10 years after diagnosis (sHR, 1.09; 95% CI, 1.04-1.15; P < .001), with no significant difference for high-risk men (sHR, 1.04; 95% CI, 0.97-1.12; P = .29). No significant differences in PCSM were found in the VA IPW cohort (sHR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.56-1.30; P = .46), and black men had a significantly lower hazard in the RCT IPW cohort (sHR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.66-0.99; P = .04).

ROS concentrations increased at 5 h post-treatment, and MTP decreased in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, decreased protein expression of Bcl-2 and increased expression of PARP-1 was observed. Furthermore, corchorusoside C increased both the activity and protein levels of caspases 3 and 7.

The BCL-2 decrease could increase the sensitivity of radiotherapy to tumors. Thus, we supposed to have an ""enhanced firepower"" effect by combining overexpressed NES1 gene therapy and 131I radiation therapy uptake by overexpressed hNIS protein. We found a weak endogenous expression of hNIS protein in PC3 cells and demonstrated that the low expression of hNIS protein in PC3 cells might be the reason for the low iodine uptake. By overexpressing hNIS in PC3, the radioactive iodine uptake ability was significantly increased. Results of in vitro and in vivo tumor proliferation experiments and 18F-fluorothymidine (18F-FLT) micro-positron emission tomography/computed tomography (micro-PET/CT) imaging showed that the combined NES1 gene therapy and 131I radiation therapy mediated by overexpressed hNIS protein had the best tumor proliferative inhibition effect.

However, the short half-life of 11C decay limited further clinical development of [11C]Met. Synthetic amino acid analog anti-1-amino-3-[18F]fluoro-cyclobutyl-1-carboxylic acid ([18F]FCABC) was developed and FDA-approved for PET imaging of recurrent prostate cancer. This study investigated ""repurposed"" [18F]FACBC for PET imaging of primary liver cancer such as hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in comparison with [11C]Met.  Methods:   [11C]Met was synthesized in the lab, and [18F]FACBC was purchased from a commercial outlet. A clinically relevant animal model of spontaneously developed HCC in the woodchucks was used for PET imaging. Bioinformatics analysis was performed for the expression of amino acid transporters responsible for radiotracer uptake and validated by PCR. Dynamic PET scans of [11C]Met and [18F]FACBC were acquired within 1 week. Standardized uptake value (SUV) was calculated for regions of interest (ROIs) defined over HCC and a liver background region. H&E staining and immunohistochemical (IHC) staining were performed with harvested tissues post-imaging.  Results:   Higher expression of ACST2 and LAT1 was found in HCC than in the surrounding liver tissues. PCR validated this differential expression. [11C]Met and [18F]FACBC displayed some differences in their uptake and retention in HCC. Both peaked in HCC with an SUV of 3.5 after 10 min post-injection. Met maintained a plateaued contrast uptake in HCC to that in the liver while [18F]FCABC declined in HCC and liver after peak uptake. The pathological assessment revealed the liver tumor as moderately differentiated similar to the human HCC and proliferative.  Conclusion:   Both [18F]FACBC and [11C]Met showed uptake in HCC through the use of a clinically relevant animal model of woodchuck HCC. The uptake and retention of [18F]FACBC and [11C]Met depend on their metabolism and also rely on the distribution of their principal amino acid transporters.""","""['Olga Sergeeva', 'Yifan Zhang', 'Jonathan D Kenyon', 'Galen A Miller-Atkins', 'Chunying Wu', 'Renuka Iyer', 'Sandra Sexton', 'Patrick Wojtylak', 'Amad Awadallah', 'Wei Xin', 'E Ricky Chan', ""James K O'Donnel"", 'Zhenghong Lee']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""EJNMMI Res""","""['Comparative evaluation of transport mechanisms of trans-1-amino-3-¹⁸Ffluorocyclobutanecarboxylic acid and L-methyl-¹¹Cmethionine in human glioma cell lines.', 'Putative transport mechanism and intracellular fate of trans-1-amino-3-18F-fluorocyclobutanecarboxylic acid in human prostate cancer.', 'In vitro characterization of uptake mechanism of L-methyl-(3)H-methionine in hepatocellular carcinoma.', '8-123IIodo-L-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-7-hydroxyisoquinoline-3-carboxylic acid.', 'syn-1-Amino-3-18Ffluorocyclobutane-1-carboxylic acid.', 'Immune checkpoint inhibition: a future guided by radiology.', 'Application of the woodchuck animal model for the treatment of hepatitis B virus-induced liver cancer.']"""

It is, however, highly controversial whether vasectomy, a common sterilization procedure for men, influences prostate cancer risk.  Methods:   We established a cohort of all Danish men (born between 1937 and 1996) and linked information on vasectomy, doctor visits, socioeconomic factors, and cancer from nationwide registries using unique personal identification numbers. Incidence risk ratios for prostate cancer by time since vasectomy and age at vasectomy during the follow-up were estimated using log-linear Poisson regression.  Results:   Overall, 26 238 cases of prostate cancer occurred among 2 150 162 Danish men during 53.4 million person-years of follow-up. Overall, vasectomized men had an increased risk of prostate cancer compared with nonvasectomized men (relative risk = 1.15, 95% confidence interval = 1.10 to 1.20). The increased risk of prostate cancer following vasectomy persisted for at least 30 years after the procedure and was observed regardless of age at vasectomy and cancer stage at diagnosis. Adjustment for the number of visits to the doctor and socioeconomic factors did not explain the association.  Conclusions:   Vasectomy is associated with a statistically significantly increased long-term risk of prostate cancer.

Herein, the in vivo effects of 20 and 50 nm sized AuNps on experimentally induced benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) was examined. Materials and methods: Adult male rats were divided into four groups (n=6-8 each). A negative control group and three groups were injected daily with testosterone (3 mg/kg/subcutaneously) to induce BPH. Animals receiving testosterone were randomized to untreated BPH group and two BPH groups which were treated intraperitoneally with 20 and 50 nm AuNps (5 mg/kg/daily) in addition to testosterone. After three weeks, histopathological changes and serum levels of testosterone and dihydrotestosterone (DHT) were analyzed. In addition, the prostate tissue levels of transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1), vascular endothelial growth factor-a (VEGF-A) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) were measured using ELISA. Results: There were significant increases in the prostate weight/body weight ratio, serum testosterone and DHT and in the prostate tissue content of TGF-β1, IL-6 and VEGF-A in the untreated BPH group. histological examination showed morphological abnormalities with more proliferation in the glandular epithelial and stromal area and with abundant epithelial papillary folds in the BPH group. Simultaneous administration of 50 nm AuNps with testosterone tended to increase the prostate weight/body weight ratio and increase the tissue level of IL-6 in compared to the BPH group. Conversely, treatment with 20 nm AuNps significantly reduced the elevated tissue content of TGF-β1, IL-6, and VEGF-A. Histopathological examination also showed that 20 nm but not the 50 nm AuNps administration ameliorates testosterone-induced prostatic hyperplasia. Conclusions: In experimentally induced BPH, AuNps can inhibit the progression of BPH in a size-dependent manner. while 20 nm AuNps ameliorate BPH by its inhibitory effects on the prostatic cell proliferation, inflammation and angiogenesis, the 50 nm AuNps could potentially exacerbate the development of BPH in rats, mainly through enhancing the inflammatory process.""","""['Bahaa Al-Trad', 'Alaa Aljabali', 'Mazhar Al Zoubi', 'Malek Shehab', 'Sahar Omari']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Int J Nanomedicine""","""['Inhibitory Effect of Thymoquinone on Testosterone-Induced Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia in Wistar Rats.', 'Quisqualis indica Improves Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia by Regulating Prostate Cell Proliferation and Apoptosis.', 'Bawu decoction () ameliorates benign prostatic hyperplasia in rats.', 'Etiology and disease process of benign prostatic hyperplasia.', 'Paying the price for standing tall: Fluid mechanics of prostate pathology.', 'Synthesis and Characterization of ZnO Nanoparticles Derived from Biomass (Sisymbrium Irio) and Assessment of Potential Anticancer Activity.', 'Self-Therapeutic Nanomaterials: Applications in Biology and Medicine.', 'Current Strategies and Potential Prospects for Nanoparticle-Mediated Treatment of Diabetic Nephropathy.', 'Molecular and cellular effects of gold nanoparticles treatment in experimental diabetic myopathy.', 'Nano-embedded medical devices and delivery systems in interventional radiology.']"""

Therefore, there is a need to develop effective therapeutics to treat CRPC, especially drug-resistant CRPC. Although various nanoparticles have been developed for drug or gene delivery and control release, approaches to reproducibly formulate the optimal treatment with nanoparticles that could effectively target CRPC and bone metastasis remain suboptimal. Recently, codelivery of a chemotherapeutic agent and a small interfering RNA (siRNA) has become a promising strategy for the treatment of drug-resistant prostate cancer. Methods: In a previous study, we prepared a novel RGD-PEG-DSPE/CaP nanoparticle as an effective and biocompatible drug and gene delivery system. In this study, we further modify the nanoparticle to obtain the LCP-RGD nanoparticle, which contains a calcium phosphate (CaP) core, dioleoyl phosphatidic acid (DOPA) and RGD modified poly(ethylene glycol)-conjugated distearoyl phosphatidylethanolamine (RGD-PEG-DSPE). This drug delivery system was used for codelivery of GRP78 siRNA and docetaxel (DTXL) for the treatment of the PC-3 CRPC. Results: The nanoparticles contain the CaP core, which can effectively compress the negatively charged siRNA, while the DOPA and RGD-PEG-DSPE component can effectively carry DTXL. The arginine-glycine-aspartic acid (RGD) segment can target the prostate cancer site, as the cancer site is neovascularized. This novel nanoparticle has good stability, excellent biocompatibility, high drug and siRNA loading capacity, and an in vitro sustainable release profile. Conclusion: Codelivery of DTXL and GRP78 siRNA has enhanced in vitro and in vivo anti-prostate cancer effects which are much greater than using free DTXL and free GRP78 siRNA together. Our study also indicated that codelivery of DTXL and GRP78 siRNA have an in vitro and in vivo combinational anti-prostate cancer effect and also could effectively sensitize the cell-killing effect of DTXL; this method may be especially suitable for drug-resistant CRPC treatment.""","""['Xiangyu Zhang', 'Zelai He', 'Longquan Xiang', 'Liang Li', 'Haiyan Zhang', 'Fanzhong Lin', 'Hongying Cao']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Drug Des Devel Ther""","""['Aptamer-Conjugated Multifunctional Polymeric Nanoparticles as Cancer-Targeted, MRI-Ultrasensitive Drug Delivery Systems for Treatment of Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Docetaxel loaded oleic acid-coated hydroxyapatite nanoparticles enhance the docetaxel-induced apoptosis through activation of caspase-2 in androgen independent prostate cancer cells.', 'Lipid-polymer hybrid nanoparticles as a new generation therapeutic delivery platform: a review.', 'NPRL2 promotes docetaxel chemoresistance in castration resistant prostate cancer cells by regulating autophagy through the mTOR pathway.', 'Emerging targets to monitor and overcome docetaxel resistance in castration resistant prostate cancer (review).', 'Efficient Delivery of P3H4 siRNA and Chlorin e6 by cRGDfK-Installed Polyarginine Nanoparticles for Tumor-Targeting Therapy of Bladder Cancer.', 'The endoplasmic reticulum stress response in prostate cancer.', 'Functionalized nanoparticles targeting biomarkers for prostate cancer imaging and therapy.', 'An Overview of siRNA Delivery Strategies for Urological Cancers.', 'Bone-targeted nanoplatform enables efficient modulation of bone tumor microenvironment for prostate cancer bone metastasis treatment.']"""

The first-in-human trial of ONC201 previously established a recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of 625 mg once every three weeks. Here, we report the results of a phase I study that evaluated the safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), and pharmacodynamics (PD) of weekly ONC201.  Methods:   Patients ≥ 18 years old with an advanced solid tumor refractory to standard treatment were enrolled. Dose escalation proceeded with a 3 + 3 design from 375 mg to 625 mg of ONC201. One cycle, also the dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) window, was 21 days. The primary endpoint was to determine the RP2D of weekly ONC201, which was confirmed in an 11-patient dose expansion cohort.  Results:   Twenty patients were enrolled: three at 375 mg and 17 at 625 mg of ONC201. The RP2D was defined as 625 mg with no DLT, treatment discontinuation, or dose modifications due to drug-related toxicity. PK profiles were consistent with every-three-week dosing and similar between the first and fourth dose. Serum prolactin and caspase-cleaved cytokeratin-18 induction were detected, along with intratumoral integrated stress response activation and infiltration of granzyme B+ Natural Killer cells. Induction of immune cytokines and effectors was higher in patients who received ONC201 once weekly versus once every three weeks. Stable disease of > 6 months was observed in several prostate and endometrial cancer patients.  Conclusions:   Weekly, oral ONC201 is well-tolerated and results in enhanced immunostimulatory activity that warrants further investigation.

The use of radio-labeled STEAP1-targeting antibodies with positron emission tomography (PET) may allow for detection of sites of metastatic prostate cancer and may refine patient selection for antigen-directed therapies. This was a prospective study in seven patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer who had at least one archival biopsy that was STEAP1-positive by immunohistochemistry. Patients received intravenous injections of ∼185 MBq and 10 mg of [89Zr]Zr-DFO-MSTP2109A, a humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody directed against STEAP1. PET/CT images, blood samples, and whole-body counts were monitored longitudinally in six patients. Here, we report on safety, biodistribution, pharmacokinetics, dose estimates to normal tissues, and initial tumor targeting for this group of patients. There was no significant acute or subacute toxicity. Favorable biodistribution and enhanced lesion uptake (in both bone and soft tissue) were observed on imaging using a mass of 10 mg of DFO-MSTP2109A. The best lesion discrimination was seen at the latest imaging time, a median of 6 days postadministration. Pharmacokinetics showed a median serum T1/2 β of 198 h, volume of central compartment of 3.54 L (similar to plasma volume), and clearance of 19.7 mL/h.

Tumor cells in the mass of the neoplasm are in continuous exchange with cells of the stromal microenvironment, through the production of soluble molecules, among which chemokines play prominent roles. CXCL14 is a chemokine with a pro-tumor role in breast and prostate carcinoma, where it is secreted by cancer associated fibroblasts, and contributes to tumor growth and invasion. We previously observed that CXCL14 expression is higher in GBM tissues than in healthy white matter. Here, we study the effects of exogenously supplemented CXCL14 on key tumorigenic properties of human GBM cell lines. We show that CXCL14 enhances the migration ability and the proliferation of U87MG and LN229 GBM cell lines. None of these effects was affected by the use of AMD3100, an inhibitor of CXCR4 receptor, suggesting that the observed CXCL14 effects are not mediated by this receptor. We also provide evidence that CXCL14 enhances the sphere-forming ability of glioblastoma stem cells, considered the initiating cells, and is responsible for tumor onset, growth and recurrence. In support of our in vitro results, we present data from several GBM expression datasets, demonstrating that CXCL14 expression is inversely correlated with overall survival, that it is enriched at the leading edge of the tumors and in infiltrating tumor areas, and it characterizes mesenchymal and NON G-CIMP tumors, known to have a particularly bad prognosis. Overall, our results point to CXCL14 as a protumorigenic chemokine in GBM.""","""['Barbara Fazi', 'Carla Proserpio', 'Silvia Galardi', 'Francesca Annesi', 'Mattia Cola', 'Annunziato Mangiola', 'Alessandro Michienzi', 'Silvia Anna Ciafrè']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Int J Mol Sci""","""['Hypoxia-induced CXC chemokine ligand 14 expression drives protumorigenic effects through activation of insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor signaling in glioblastoma.', 'Expression and clinical significance of CXC chemokines in the glioblastoma microenvironment.', 'Expression of CXCL14 and its anticancer role in breast cancer.', 'Chemokine CXCL14; a double-edged sword in cancer development.', 'The multifarious roles of the chemokine CXCL14 in cancer progression and immune responses.', 'Re-convolving the compositional landscape of primary and recurrent glioblastoma reveals prognostic and targetable tissue states.', 'Hypoxia-induced CXC chemokine ligand 14 expression drives protumorigenic effects through activation of insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor signaling in glioblastoma.', 'Systematic Analysis of Chemokines Reveals CCL18 is a Prognostic Biomarker in Glioblastoma.', 'CXCL14 facilitates the growth and metastasis of ovarian carcinoma cells via activation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway.', 'Breaking Bad: Autophagy Tweaks the Interplay Between Glioma and the Tumor Immune Microenvironment.']"""

To deliver high-quality patient treatment, prostate cancer clinicians and researchers require a user-friendly system that offers an easy and efficient way to obtain relevant and accurate information about patients from a robust and expanding database.  Methods:   PROSPeCT was designed and implemented to make it easy for users to query the prostate cancer patient database by creating, saving, and reusing simple and complex definitions.

Method:   Three-dimensional fiducial tracking was performed during VMAT by pairing short-arc (3°) MV digital tomosynthesis (DTS) images to triggered kV images. To evaluate MLC_MODIFIER efficacy, two cohorts of patients were considered. For first 12 patients, plans were manually edited to expose one fiducial marker. Next for 15 patients, plans were modified using MLC_MODIFIER script. MLC_MODIFIER evaluated MLC apertures at appropriate angles for marker visibility. Angles subtended by control points were compressed and low-dose ""imaging"" control points were inserted and exposed one marker with 1 cm margin. Patient's images were retrospectively reviewed to determine rate of MV registration failures. Failure categories were poor DTS image quality, MLC blockage of fiducials, or unknown reasons. Dosimetric differences in rectum, bladder, and urethra D1 cc, PTV maximum dose, and PTV dose homogeneity (PTV HI) were evaluated. Statistical significance was evaluated using Fisher's exact and Student's t test.  Result:   Overall MV registration failures, failures due to poor image quality, MLC blockage, and unknown reasons were 33% versus 8.9% (P < 0.0001), 8% versus 6.4% (P < 0.05), 13.6% versus 0.1% (P < 0.0001), and 7.6% versus 2.4% (P < 0.0001) for manually edited and MLC_MODIFIER plans, respectively. PTV maximum and HI increased on average from unmodified plans by 2.1% and 0.3% (P < 0.004) and 22.0% and 3.3% (P < 0.004) for manually edited and MLC_MODIFIED plans, respectively. Changes in bladder, rectum, and urethra D1CC were similar for each method and less than 0.7%.

In recent years, PSMA was also found to be expressed in tumor-associated vasculature in many nonprostatic solid tumors. However, the expression pattern of PSMA in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is not well studied.  Methods:   In this study, we examined PSMA expression in 103 HCC tissues using immunohistochemical staining and analyzed the association between PSMA expression and other clinicopathological features and prognosis.  Results:   Among the 103 cases, 27 cases (26%) showed PSMA expression in more than 50% of tumor-associated vasculature, 49 cases (48%) showed PSMA expression in less than 50% of vasculature, and 27 cases (26%) did not have detectable PSMA expression. Vascular PSMA expression was associated with several clinicopathological features, such as tumor stage, tumor differentiation, lymph node metastasis, and Ki-67 index. Furthermore, high vascular PSMA expression was also associated with poor prognosis in patients with HCC. Univariate and multivariate analyses showed that high vascular PSMA expression can be used as an independent prognostic marker for HCC.

We investigate the associations between cancer-related symptoms, health-related quality of life (HRQL), and poor psychological outcomes in men whose treatment for PCa involved ADT.  Methods:   A cross-sectional postal questionnaire was administered to UK men 18-42 months post diagnosis of PCa. Men completed items on functional outcomes using the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC-26), EuroQol-5D (EQ-5D), and the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Fatigue subscale. Psychological outcomes (mental well-being and psychological distress) were assessed using the Short Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-being Scale (SWEMWBS) and the Kessler 6-item scale (K6), respectively. Associations between explanatory variables and psychological outcomes were assessed using stepped logistic regression.  Results:   13,097 men treated with ADT completed a questionnaire. A minority of men reported poor mental well-being (15.5%) or severe psychological distress (6.6%). After controlling for sociodemographic and clinical variables, reporting clinically significant fatigue was strongly associated with severe psychological distress (OR 9.92; 95% CI 7.63 to 12.89) and poor well-being (OR 3.86; 95% CI 3.38 to 4.42). All cancer-related symptoms and HRQL variables were associated with both psychological outcomes.  Conclusions:   While the majority of men treated with ADT did not report poor psychological outcomes, a small proportion reported severe problems. Clinically significant fatigue was demonstrated as a possible indicator of poor outcomes.

PSMA-targeted endoradiotherapies are also being increasingly utilized and for these applications, the radiopharmaceutical distribution in normal organs is particularly important because it may limit the dose that can be delivered to tumors. In this study, we measured both interpatient and intrapatient variability of [18F]DCFPyL uptake in the most relevant normal organs.  Procedures:   Baseline and 6-month follow-up PSMA-targeted [18F]DCFPyL PET/computed tomography (CT) scans from 39 patients with PCa were reviewed. Volumes of interest were manually drawn using the best visual approximation of the organ edge for both lacrimal glands, all four major salivary glands, the liver, the spleen, and both kidneys for all patients. The average SUVmean, the COVs, and intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) across scans were calculated. Bland-Altman analyses were performed for all organs to derive repeatability coefficients (RCs).  Results:   The liver demonstrated the lowest interpatient variability (13.0 and 16.6 % at baseline and follow-up, respectively), while the spleen demonstrated the largest interpatient variability (44.6 and 51.0 % at baseline and follow-up, respectively). The lowest intrapatient variability was found in the spleen (ICC 0.86) while the highest intrapatient variability was in the kidneys (ICCs 0.40-0.50). Bland-Altman analyses showed 95 % repeatability coefficients for mean uptake > 40 % for multiple organs and were highest for the lacrimal glands, kidneys, and spleen.  Conclusions:   Normal organs demonstrate significant variability in uptake of the PSMA-targeted radiotracer [18F]DCFPyL. Depending on the organ, different contributions of interpatient and intrapatient factors affect the intrinsic variability. The RCs also vary significantly among the different organs were highest for the lacrimal glands, kidneys, and spleen.

Cell Counting Kit-8 assay was applied to analyze cell proliferation and Gemcitabine sensitivity. Cell apoptosis was detected using Annexin V-FITC/PI double-stained flow cytometry. The expression of ABCC1 protein was examined using Western blotting.  Results:   Firstly, the expression of GHET1 was up-regulated in BC, its high expression was relevant to high grade and muscle invasion of BC patients. Secondly, high expression of GHET1 was related to low Gemcitabine sensitivity of BC patients, and GHET1 was highly expressed in Gemcitabine-resistant BC cell lines. Thirdly, knockdown of GHET1 decreased the IC50 of Gemcitabine in Gemcitabine-resistant BC cell lines and advanced the Gemcitabine-induced cytotoxicity; GHET1 promoted Gemcitabine resistance in BC. Finally, knockdown of GHET1 also inhibited the expression of ABCC1 protein in Gemcitabine-resistant BC cells.

The aim of the present study was to screen prognosis‑associated long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) and construct a risk score system for the disease. The RNA‑sequencing data of patients with HCC (including 100 HCC samples and 26 normal samples) were extracted from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. In addition, GSE55092, GSE19665 and GSE10186 datasets were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus database. Combined with weighted gene co‑expression network analysis, the identification and functional annotation of stable modules was performed. Using the MetaDE package, the consensus differentially expressed RNAs (DE‑RNAs) were analyzed. To construct a risk score system, prognosis‑associated lncRNAs and the optimal lncRNA combination were separately analyzed by survival and penalized packages. Finally, pathway enrichment analysis for the nodes in an lncRNA‑mRNA network was conducted via Gene Set Enrichment Analysis. A total of four stable modules and 3,051 consensus DE‑RNAs were identified. The stable modules were significantly associated with the histological grades of HCC, tumor, node and metastasis stage, pathological stage, recurrence and exposure to radiation therapy. A 9‑lncRNA optimal combination [DiGeorge syndrome critical region gene 9, glucosidase, β, acid 3 (GBA3), HLA complex group 4, N‑acetyltransferase 8B, neighbor of breast cancer 1 gene 2, prostate androgen‑regulated transcript 1, ret finger protein like 1 antisense RNA 1, solute carrier family 22 member 18 antisense and T‑cell leukemia/lymphoma 6] was selected from the 14 prognosis‑associated lncRNAs, and was further supported by the validation dataset, GSE10186. The lncRNA‑mRNA co‑expression network revealed lncRNA GBA3 as a positive regulator of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase 2, an important enzyme in the metabolic pathway of gluconeogenesis. A risk score system was established based on the optimal 9 lncRNAs, which may be valuable for predicting the prognosis of patients with HBV‑positive HCC and improving understanding of mechanisms associated with the pathogenesis of this disease.

Immunohistochemical analyses of EZH2 was performed in tumor tissue samples from PCa and benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH). The human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) promoter was chosen to transcriptionally control EZH2 gene expression to obtain adenoviral replication (Ad‑hTERT‑EZH2shRNA) in human PCa cell lines. The inhibitory effect of Ad‑hTERT‑EZH2shRNA on EZH2 expression was evaluated by reverse transcription‑-quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blot analyses. Cell Counting Kit‑8 assays were used to examine the effects of the Ad‑hTERT‑EZH2shRNA on cell proliferation. Transwell Matrigel invasion assays were used to detected cell invasion. Immunohistochemistry showed that EZH2 staining was stronger in castration‑resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) samples, compared with androgen‑dependent prostate cancer (ADPC) samples, and was absent in BPH. Furthermore, EZH2 expression knockdown suppressed PCa cell proliferation and invasion. In addition, it was found that Ad‑hTERT‑EZH2shRNA selectively replicated and significantly reduced the expression of EZH2 in PCa cells lines. The growth ability and invasion of DU145 and PC3 cells in vitro was effectively inhibited by Ad‑hTERT‑EZH2shRNA. Silencing the expression of EZH2 led to decreased expression of CCND1 and Ki67 and increased expression of E‑cadherin, as determined by western blot analysis. Thus, it was shown that CRAds armed with EZH2 shRNA exhibited significant antitumor effects in human PCa cells.

Subsequently, it was ascertained whether DNA methylation plays a role in the expression of these genes in prostate cancer cells. Hypermethylation of APC, DKK3, GPX3, GSTP1, MGMT, PTGS2, RASSF1, TIMP2 and TNFRSF10D resulted in downregulation of their expression in prostate cancer cell lines as compared to WT fibroblasts.

Biopsy to radical prostatectomy (RP) specimen upgrading/downgrading is well described, and is often the rationale for costly imaging or genomic studies. We present simple, no-cost analyses of clinical parameters to predict which GS 6 and GS 8 patients will change to GS 7 at prostatectomy. From May 2006 to December 2012, 1590 patients underwent robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP). After exclusions, we identified a GS 6 cohort of 374 patients and a GS 8 cohort of 91 patients. During this era, >1000 additional patients were enrolled in an active surveillance (AS) program. For GS 6, 265 (70.9%) of 374 patients were upgraded, and the cohort included 183 (48.9%) patients eligible for AS by the Prostate Cancer Research International Active Surveillance Study (PRIAS) standards, of which 57.9% were upgraded. PB features that predicted a >90% chance of upgrading included ≥ 7 cores positive, maximum foci length ≥ 8 mm in any core, and total tumor involvement ≥ 30%.

The 32 involved patients with localized prostate cancer underwent LRP between July 2017 and October 2018. All of the patients received DVC pretightening technique. A laparoscopic intestinal clamp was used to narrow and strain DVC. The needle passage was limited between the bone and clamp. The ligation time, DVC-related blood loss, and continence data were recorded. The ligation of DVC in 32 patients was performed with DVC pretightening technique. Every suture was completed with one attempt. The mean ligation time was 2.7 ± 1.0 min. The DVC-related blood loss was 2.0 ± 1.3 ml. The 3-month continence rate was 81.3% (26/32). Positive margin rate was 9.4% (3/32). In conclusion, the DVC pretightening technique simplified the ligation of DVC during LRP. It is a safe and reliable technique.

High levels of neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and platelet to lymphocyte ration (PLR) are parameters of systemic inflammation which have been identified to be associated with poor prognosis in PCa. Bone is one of the most common sites of metastasis from prostate cancer; however, there are few studies concerning the correlation of NLR, PLR, and bone metastases in PCa. The aim of this study was to evaluate the performance of neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) or platelet to lymphocyte (PLR) in diagnosis of bone metastasis of prostate cancer (PCa).  Methods:   Data of 74 PCa patients without metastases, 51 PCa patients with bone metastases, and 43 patients with benign prostatic hypertrophy (BPH) were retrospectively reviewed. The difference of patients' clinical and laboratory characteristics of the three groups was comparatively studied. ROC analysis was used to evaluate the benefit of adding NLR or PLR to prostate specific antigen (PSA) in prediction of bone metastases. Depending on this cutoff value, patients were divided into high-NLR or low-NLR group, high-PLR or low-PLR group.  Results:   There were significant differences in NLR and PLR between groups with bone metastases and without bone metastases (p = 0.044; p = 0.030), while there was no significant difference between NLR and PLR of the patients with localized prostate cancer and BPH (p = 0.462; p = 0.102). NLR and PLR were correlated with PSA level in the patients with prostate cancer (p = 0.006, r = 0.247; p = 0.025, r = 0.200). The distribution of PSA showed significant differences between the high-NLR and low-NLR group, as well as between the high-PLR and low-PLR group. By applying the ROC curve method, the AUC values of PSA with NLR or PLR were 0.725 and 0.838 (0.763 - 0.913), respectively. Although PSA + PLR had the largest area, there was no statistical significance between PSA + PLR and PSA (p = 0.6992).

Hence, to determine the expression pattern and function of LINC00662 in PCa.  Patients and methods:   LINC00662 expression was first detected in PCa cell lines and tissue samples by qRT-PCR. Based on follow-up data, correlations of LINC00662 expression and clinicopathological features, including overall survival, in PCa patients were evaluated. Cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and apoptosis were detected by CCK-8 assay, colony-forming assay, Wound-healing assay, transwell assay, and flow cytometry, respectively. Additionally, LINC00662-specific miRNA was further confirmed using the dual-luciferase reporter assay and RT-PCR.  Results:   LINC00662 was significantly upregulated in PCa tissues and cell lines compared with adjacent normal tissue and a normal prostate epithelial cell line. Higher expression of LINC00662 was positively associated with distant metastasis and shorter overall survival. In addition, multivariate analysis revealed that tissue LINC00662 expression was confirmed to be an independent prognostic factor for PCa. Furthermore, LINC00662 silencing inhibited the proliferation, migration, and invasion of PC-3 and LNCaP cells, and promoted apoptosis in vitro. Bioinformatics methods and luciferase reporter assay revealed the close link within miR-34a and 3'-untranslated region (UTR) of LINC00662 and further confirmed that LINC00662 could function as a sponge of miR-34a in PCa cells.

Many studies exploring the relationship between the LEP rs7799039 (G2548A) polymorphism and cancer risk have observed controversial results. To extensively evaluate this potential association, we conducted this meta-analysis. Methods: All eligible studies published up to August 2018 on the relationship between the LEP rs7799039 G>A polymorphism and cancer risk were obtained by searching PubMed, EMBASE, and the China Biology Medicine databases. The association of LEP rs7799039 G>A polymorphism with cancer risk was evaluated by crude ORs together with their 95% CI's. Results: Thirty-one case-control studies involving 25,799 subjects were included for meta-analysis. We identify a significant correlation with an overall cancer risk when these eligible case-control studies were pooled for analysis: for AA vs GG: an OR = 1.22, 95% CI = 1.01-1.48, P = 0.042 and for AA/GA vs GG: an OR = 1.16, 95% CI = 1.02-1.33, P = 0.026. A significant association was also detected in Asians, prostate cancer, other cancers, and hematopoietic malignancy subgroups. Sensitivity analysis was conducted by deleting an individual study in turn and calculation of the pooled ORs and CIs of the remainders. The results of sensitivity analyses indicated that no eligible study influenced the pooled ORs and CIs materially. Begg's and Egger's tests revealed that there was no evidence of publication bias.

In this work, we investigated the effect of MCD-mediated actin depolymerization on various cellular phenotypes including traction force, cell stiffness, focal adhesions, and intracellular drug accumulation. In addition to a reduction in the contractile cellular traction, MCD acutely inhibits the maturation of focal adhesions. Alteration of contractile forces and focal adhesions affects the trypsin-mediated detachment kinetics of cells. Moreover, MCD-mediated actin depolymerization increases the intracellular accumulation of microtubule-targeting agents (MTAs) by ~50% with respect to the untreated cells. As MCD treatment enhances the intracellular concentration of drugs, we hypothesized that the MCD-sensitized cancer cells could be effectively killed by low doses of MTAs. Our results in cervical, breast, hepatocellular, prostate cancer and multidrug-resistant breast cancer cells confirmed the above hypothesis. Further, the combined use of MCD and MTAs synergistically inhibits the proliferation of tumor cells. These results indicate the potential use of MCD in combination with MTAs for cancer chemotherapy and suggest that targeting both actin and microtubules simultaneously may be useful for cancer therapy.

This phase I/II trial evaluated onalespib in combination with abiraterone acetate (AA) and either prednisone or prednisolone (P) in men with CRPC progressing on AA/P.  Patients and methods:   Patients with progressing CRPC were randomly assigned to receive 1 of 2 regimens of onalespib combined with AA/P.

Primary endpoints were response rate and safety. Secondary endpoints included evaluation of androgen receptor (AR) depletion in circulating tumor cells (CTC) and in fresh tumor tissue biopsies.  Results:   Forty-eight patients were treated with onalespib in combination with AA/P. The most common ≥grade 3 toxicities related to onalespib included diarrhea (21%) and fatigue (13%). Diarrhea was dose limiting at 260 and 160 mg/m2 for regimens 1 and 2, respectively. Transient decreases in CTC counts and AR expression in CTC were observed in both regimens. HSP72 was significantly upregulated following onalespib treatment, but only a modest decrease in AR and GR was shown in paired pre- and posttreatment tumor biopsy samples.

Objective:   To identify modifiable dosimetric and clinical risk factors impacting QOL and late toxicity following PPRT.  Design, setting, and participants:   A prospective cohort study of consecutive men with prostate cancer who received PPRT between 2007 and 2015 at a single academic institution.  Intervention:   Patients were prospectively evaluated using the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC-26) QOL instrument. Radiation Therapy Oncology Group/Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events toxicity grades were assigned at every follow-up visit. Treatment was delivered to the prostate bed (median 68Gy)±pelvic lymphatics (65%, median 50.4Gy) with daily image guidance. Androgen deprivation therapy was concomitantly administered to 132 (66%) men for a median of 4mo.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Changes were deemed relevant if they exceeded the minimally clinically important difference (MCID), as calculated by a distribution-based method. Generalized estimating equation models and Cox regression were used for QOL and late toxicity univariate and multivariable analysis.  Results and limitations:   Overall, 199 men were identified with a median follow-up of 33mo. Overall urinary function (UF), bowel function (BF), sexual function (SF), and urinary irritation/obstruction (UI/UO) scores were never lower than the MCID. Between 8% and 18% of men experienced a small multidomain (1× MCID) decline, and 0-8% experienced a moderate multidomain decline (2× MCID) at a given time point up to 84mo after PPRT. The rates of freedom from grade 2 or higher (Gr2+) genitourinary (GU) and gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity were 94% and 95%, respectively, at 4yr. Factors associated with worse QOL or toxicity included longer time to PPRT (UC and UF), higher BMI (UF, BF, and late GI toxicity), older age (BF, SF, and late GU toxicity); hormone therapy (SF), total dose (late GI toxicity), tobacco history (BF), and higher bladder V70Gy (UC, UF, and late GU toxicity).  Conclusions:   Long-term QOL and late toxicity are favorable following postprostatectomy radiation therapy. Identifiable clinical and dosimetric risk factors may guide decision making to optimize urinary, sexual, and bowel function.  Patient summary:   The following study provides a detailed report of favorable patient-reported quality of life and late side-effect profiles of radiation therapy following surgery for localized prostate cancer. Our findings provide patients guidance on what symptoms to expect if they are planning to undergo radiation therapy in this setting. It also allows physicians to counsel patients appropriately, and modify certain clinical and radiation-related risk factors to optimize quality of life.""","""['Adil S Akthar', 'Chuanhong Liao', 'Scott E Eggener', 'Stanley L Liauw']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Eur Urol""","""['Dosimetric and clinical factors predicting quality of life after post prostatectomy radiation therapy: useful tool or not?', 'Improved toxicity profile following high-dose postprostatectomy salvage radiation therapy with intensity-modulated radiation therapy.', 'Quality-of-Life Outcomes and Toxicity Profile Among Patients With Localized Prostate Cancer After Radical Prostatectomy Treated With Stereotactic Body Radiation: The SCIMITAR Multicenter Phase 2 Trial.', 'Comparative toxicity and dosimetric profile of whole-pelvis versus prostate bed-only intensity-modulated radiation therapy after prostatectomy.', 'Quality of life after radiotherapy for prostate cancer.', 'Functional Quality-of-Life Outcomes Reported by Men Treated for Localized Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Literature Review.', 'The Longitudinal Course of Prospectively Recorded Patient-reported Outcomes in Prostate Cancer Patients Treated with Surgery and Salvage Radiotherapy.', 'Application of a genetic signature of late GU toxicity in SCIMITAR, a Post-op SBRT trial.', 'A Phase 1 Trial of Highly Conformal, Hypofractionated Postprostatectomy Radiation Therapy.', 'Comparison Between Dose-Escalated Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy and 3-Dimensional Conformal Radiation Therapy for Salvage Radiation Therapy After Prostatectomy.', 'Radiation-induced haemorrhagic cystitis after prostate cancer radiotherapy: factors associated to hospitalization and treatment strategies.']"""

Being a transmembrane protein acting as a glutamate carboxypeptidase enzyme, PSMA is highly expressed in prostate cancer cells. PSMA can also be labeled with 64Cu, offering a longer half-life and different resolution imaging. Several studies documented bio-distribution and pitfalls of 68Ga-PSMA as well as of 64Cu- PSMA. No data are reported on differences between these two variants of PSMA. Our aim was to evaluate physiological distribution of these two tracers and to analyze false positive cases.  Methods:   We examined tracer bio-distribution in prostate cancer patients with negative 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT (n=20) and negative 64Ga-PSMA PET/CT (n=10). A diagnostic pitfall for each tracer was documented.  Result:   Bio-distribution of both tracers was similar, with some differences due to renal excretion of 68Ga- PSMA and biliary excretion of 64Cu-PSMA. 68Ga-PSMA uptake was observed in sarcoidosis while 64Cu- PSMA uptake was recorded in pneumonitis.  Discussion:   Both tracers may present similar bio-distribution in the human body, with similar uptake in exocrine glands and high intestinal uptake. Similarly to other tracers, false positive cases cannot be excluded in clinical practice.  Conclusion:   The knowledge of difference in bio-distribution between two tracers may help in interpretation of PET data. Diagnostic pitfalls can be documented, due to the possibility of PSMA uptake in inflammation. Our results are preliminary to future studies comparing diagnostic accuracies of 68Ga-PSMA and 64Cu-PSMA.""","""['Ferdinando Calabria', 'Robert Pichler', 'Mario Leporace', 'Johannes Wolfsgruber', 'Pierluigi Coscarelli', 'Andreas Dunzinger', 'Orazio Schillaci', 'Giuseppe Lucio Cascini', 'Antonio Bagnato']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Curr Radiopharm""","""['More advantages in detecting bone and soft tissue metastases from prostate cancer using 18F-PSMA PET/CT.', 'Normal distribution pattern and physiological variants of 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT imaging.', '68Ga-labeled PSMA-11\xa0(68Ga-isoPROtrace-11) synthesized with ready to use kit: normal biodistribution and uptake characteristics of tumour lesions.', 'The role of 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT scan in biochemical recurrence after primary treatment for prostate cancer: a systematic review of the literature.', 'PET/CT With 68Ga-PSMA in Prostate Cancer: Radiopharmaceutical Background and Clinical Implications.', 'Head-to-head comparison of 68GaGa-PSMA-11 and 18FFDG PET/CT in multiple myeloma.', 'PSMA Theranostics: Review of the Current Status of PSMA-Targeted Imaging and Radioligand Therapy.']"""

The decision to undertake prostate biopsy is usually based on prostate specific antigen (PSA) level and digital rectal examination (DRE). A risk-based strategy may reduce the numbers of unnecessary prostate biopsies.  Methods:   Retrospective statistical analysis of data from 195 men undergoing their initial prostate biopsy from 1.1.2015 to 31.12.2015 based on elevated PSA ≥ 4.0 ng/ml and/or abnormal DRE were included. Subsequent risk stratification using the European Randomized study of Screening for Prostate Cancer calculator (ERSPC) was used with the intent to calculate the accuracy of ERSPC with the aim to avoid unnecessary (negative) prostate biopsies.  Results:   The specific values of sensitivity and specificity in this cohort were 94.34 % and 24.72 %. In direct comparison of PSA and ERSPC calculator, the differences between sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value and false omission rate as negative were statistically insignificant, but the positive predictive value was on the edge of statistical significance (p = 0.054), slightly in favor for ERSPC calculator.  Conclusion:   PSA still remains the single most predictive factor for identifying men with an increased risk of prostate cancer to be detected on prostate biopsy, but using other risk factors included in ERSPC can considerably reduce the numbers of unnecessary biopsies on initial screening (Tab. 4, Fig. 2, Ref. 23).""","""['J Breza', 'F Subin', 'M Bernadic', 'M Tomas', 'D Pindak']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Bratisl Lek Listy""","""['Prediction of Prostate Cancer: External Validation of the ERSPC Risk Calculator in a Contemporary Dutch Clinical Cohort.', 'Prostate-Specific Antigen-Based Screening for Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Evidence Review for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force Internet.', 'Combined Clinical Parameters and Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging for Advanced Risk Modeling of Prostate Cancer-Patient-tailored Risk Stratification Can Reduce Unnecessary Biopsies.', 'Positive predictive value of prostate biopsy indicated by prostate-specific-antigen-based prostate cancer screening: trends over time in a European randomized trial*.', 'PSA-based screening for prostate cancer.

Here, we describe a fast specimen retrieval technique for RALP to obtain high-quality tissue specimen with minimal warm ischemia time for next-generation biobanking. Here, we show that using fast retrieval technique, short warm ischemia times can be achieved while not increasing the surgical time. Patients undergoing RALP with written informed consent participated in Helsinki Urological Bank study. Previously operated RALP patients and those, who were not willing to participate in the study, served as a control group. The study consisted of 1685 patients, 684 in fast retrieval and 1001 in control group. We developed a novel fast retrieval technique in which fascia is opened for camera port according to the prostate size and a running suture is placed and tightened against the camera port in the beginning of the operation. Immediately after prostate is freed from attachments, suture is loosened and the prostate is extirpated inside the endoscopic bag through the camera port fascial opening, then the fascial suture is again tightened against the camera port and the RALP procedure is completed. The mean warm ischemia times in fast retrieval group were 20 min 18 s and 22 min 30 s, respectively, in patients without and with lymphadenectomy. The mean console and surgery times with and without lymphadenectomy were similar in both groups. There were no technique-related complications associated with Fast Retrieval procedure. Tissue integrity test results for the RNA and DNA quality showed good quality for the specimen. Fast retrieval technique can easily and safely be utilized to maximize usefulness of RALP tissue specimen in downstream biobank applications.""","""['Anssi Petas', 'Andrew Erickson', 'Henrikki Santti', 'Mika Matikainen', 'Tuomas Mirtti', 'Antti Rannikko']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""J Robot Surg""","""['Integrity of prostatic tissue for molecular analysis after robotic-assisted laparoscopic and open prostatectomy.', 'Biobanking of derivatives from radical retropubic and robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy tissues as part of the prostate cancer biorepository network.', 'Biobanking after robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy: a quality assessment of providing prostate tissue for RNA studies.', 'Comparison of retropubic, laparoscopic and robotic radical prostatectomy: who is the winner?', 'Robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy.', 'Comprehensive data analysis of genomics, epigenomics, and transcriptomics to identify specific biomolecular markers for prostate adenocarcinoma.']"""

However, its prognostic value and association with other biomarkers have not been fully explored. We assessed the combined value of TFF3 and PTEN in two cohorts: one is managed surgically for localized PCa and the second is managed non-surgically by androgen deprivation therapy for advanced disease.  Design:   228 radical prostatectomies (RP) and 318 transurethral resection of prostate (TURP) samples were assessed by immunohistochemistry (IHC) for TFF3 and by IHC and fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) for PTEN. Results of biomarkers expression were correlated with various pathological and clinical outcome parameters including biochemical recurrence (BCR) in the RP cohort and cancer-specific mortality (PCSM) and overall survival (OS) in the TURP cohort.  Results:   TFF3 expression was detected in 131/226 (57.9%) RP samples and 148/318 (46.5%) of TURP cases. In general, TFF3 positivity was less frequently observed with advanced Gleason Groups. TFF3 expression was also assessed in relation to PTEN expression. Only 15-16% of TFF3-expressed cases were present in association with complete loss of PTEN expression in the TURP and localized cohorts, respectively. Loss of TFF3 expression was not related to BCR after RP, but was prognostic in the non-surgical cohort and associated with decrease OS and PCSM (HR 2.31, CI: 1.67-3.18, p < 0.0001) and (HR 3.99, CI: 2.43-6.56; p < 0.0001), respectively. Adjusting for Gleason score, combined loss of TFF3/PTEN was most associated with OS (HR 2.33, CI: 1.49-3.62; p < 0.0001) and PCSM (HR = 3.44, CI: 1.75-6.78, p < 0.0001).  Conclusion:   The study documents for the first time significant association for combined status of TFF3 expression and PTEN loss in OS and PCSM in patients not managed by surgical intervention.

Results:   pT0 was identified in 358 (0.2%) out of 160,532 clinically localized RP patients.

In a subset of patients with available number of biopsy cores, pT0 was identified in 34 (33.3%) patients with ≥2 positive biopsy cores. Age, race, marital status, hospital region, population density, PSA, as well as number of biopsy cores did not discriminate between pT0 and non-pT0 cases.

Magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) play an important role in this field acting as a valuable tool in the biomarker immunocapture and detection. In this work, Co0.25Zn0.75Fe2O4 (CoZnFeONPs) nanoparticles were synthesized and applied as enzyme mimics of peroxidase-like catalysis in a disposable enzyme-free microfluidic immunoarray device (μID). The catalytic activity of CoZnFeONPs was evaluated by hydrogen peroxide detection using cyclic voltammetry and the apparent Michaelis-Menten constant was estimated by Lineweaver-Burk equation showing good Km values. In μID, the immunosensors were assembled with monoclonal antibody against CYFRA 21-1 covalently immobilized on graphene oxide previously deposited on the screen-printed carbon-based electrodes. Under optimized conditions, the method presented a good linear response for CYFRA 21-1 in the range of 3.9-1000 fg mL-1 achieving an ultralow limit of detection (LOD) of 0.19 fg mL-1. For comparison, Fe3O4 nanoparticles (FeONPs) was also synthetized and presented results slight inferior to that obtained with CoZnFeONPs. The methods developed using both MNPs exhibited countless advantages when compared with the immunosensors developed for CYFRA-21-1, previously reported in the literature. The methods were successful applied for the detection of CYFRA 21-1 in real serum samples of healthy and prostate cancer patients and showed good correlation with results obtained with the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).

To date, no study exists investigating the relationship between liver tumor burden and clinical laboratory markers.  Materials and methods:   Metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) patients with radiographic evidence of liver metastases were selected for this study. Volumetric measurements of liver metastases were ascertained for all available patients. Prostate specific antigen (PSA), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), albumin (ALB), total bilirubin and hemoglobin (HGB) levels were then assessed to coincide with the scan dates. Univariate and multivariate mixed-model regression analysis were performed to evaluate the relationship between laboratory markers and liver lesion volume. Data sets with non-normal distribution were logarithmically transformed. Akaike information criteria (AIC) was used to identify the most reliable multivariate model.  Results:   In our heavily pretreated liver-metastatic patient population, univariate analysis demonstrated a statistically significant positive correlation between PSA (p = 0.0002), ALP (p = 0.0305), AST (p < 0.0001), ALT (p = 0.0049), and LDH (p = 0.0019) and liver lesion volume. Additionally, ALB (p = 0.0006) and HGB (p = 0.0103) had statistically significant negative correlation. Multivariate analysis identified AST and hemoglobin assessments as the best predictors of increasing liver lesion burden. Preliminary data on circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) mutational and amplification findings are also reported.  Conclusions:   Analysis identified AST and hemoglobin as optimal predictors of liver lesion volume. These patients have a heavy burden of ctDNA abnormalities. Further studies with a larger patient population are needed to verify these results. Micro Abstract: This study investigates the association between liver lesion burden and clinical laboratory markers in castrate-resistant prostate cancer patients with hepatic metastases. Our univariate analysis identified multiple laboratory markers as significant indicators of worsening hepatic disease.

This system consists of two l-carnitine acyltransferases (CPT1 and CPT2) and the carnitine acylcarnitine translocase. In mammals, two CPT1 homologs (CPT1A and CPT1B) were previously described. By using positional cloning gene approaches, RT-PCR, and next-generation sequencing (NGS), we sought to identify novel human genes that might be involved in fatty acid metabolism. Thus, we discovered a third CPT1 homolog (CATL1/CPT1C), transcribed into two major protein-coding transcripts. This gene on chromosome 19q13.33 encodes a protein participating in the control of whole-body glucose homeostasis and is predominantly expressed in the central nervous system. Steroid hormones affect CPT1C mRNA expression in human prostate and breast cancer cell lines. Although the major involvement of CPT1C in fatty acid catabolism makes it a crucial gene for cellular homeostasis, its precise role in oxidative stress needs further investigation.

Methods:   The initial PSA test of men aged 50 years and younger, taken from January 2008 to December 2018 in two medical centers, was retrospectively analyzed. Cases with prostate cancer were excluded. The distributions of initial PSA and PSA velocity, and the correlations between these two values were estimated. Kaplan-Meier and log-rank test were used to estimate significant difference on the risk of PSA≥2.5 ng/mL after initial PSA measurement, stratified by median initial PSA (0.6 ng/mL).  Results:   A total of 9461 men with non-prostate cancer were included in this study. The median initial PSA value was 0.7 ng/mL. A total of 853 men had their PSA measured two times or more and the median PSA velocity was 0.026 ng·mL-1·yr-1.

To extract nutrient patterns, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) based on the 35 nutrient items were applied. Varimax rotation was used for improving interpretation and minimizing correlation between the factors. Logistic regression was used to determine the odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) of prostate cancer by higher scores on the nutrient patterns.

For each plan, the doses calculated with the MC approach at four three-dimensional reference points were compared to the corresponding Eclipse calculations, as well as calculations performed using the clinical software package, MUCheck. Each MC arc simulation of 107 particles required 13-25 min of total time, including processing and calculation. The average discrepancies in calculated dose values between the MC method and Eclipse were 2.03% (compared to 3.43% for MUCheck) for prostate cases, 2.45% (3.22% for MUCheck) for head and neck cases, 1.7% (5.51% for MUCheck) for brain cases, and 2.84% (5.64% for MUCheck) for miscellaneous cases. Of 276 comparisons, 201 showed greater agreement between the treatment planning system and MC vs MUCheck. The largest discrepancies between MC and MUCheck were found in regions of high dose gradients and heterogeneous densities.

Co-culture assays reveal enhanced TNT formation between stressed and unstressed PCa cells as well as from stressed PCa to osteoblasts. Stress-induced chaperones clusterin and YB-1 localize within TNTs, are transported bi-directionally via TNTs and facilitate TNT formation in PI3K/AKT and Eps8-dependent manner. AR variants, induced by AR antagonism to mediate resistance to AR pathway inhibition, also enhance TNT production and rescue loss of clusterin- or YB-1-repressed TNT formation.

The correlation between bounce with PSA response at 4 years (nadir PSA < 0.4 ng/ml) and biochemical failure-free survival (BFFS) was also explored.  Materials and methods:   The study included four treatment groups: 35 Gy/five fractions once per week (QW) (TG-1; n = 84); 40 Gy/five fractions QW (TG-2; n = 100); 40 Gy/five fractions every other day (TG-3; n = 73); and 26 Gy/two fractions QW (TG-4; n = 30). PSA bounce was defined as a rise in PSA by 0.2 ng/ml (nadir + 0.2) or 2 ng/ml (nadir + 2.0) above nadir followed by a decrease back to nadir. Patients with fewer than three follow-up PSA tests were excluded from the pooled analysis.  Results:   In total, 287 patients were included, with a median follow-up of 5.0 years. The pooled 5-year cumulative incidence of bounce by nadir + 2.0 was 8%. The 2-year cumulative incidences of PSA bounce by nadir + 0.2 were 28.9, 21, 19.6 and 16.7% (P = 0.12) and by nadir + 2.0 were 7.2, 8, 2.7 and 6.7% (P = 0.32) for TG-1 to TG-4, respectively. Multivariable analysis revealed that for nadir + 2.0, pre-treatment PSA (odds ratio 0.49; 95% confidence interval 0.26-0.97) correlated with PSA bounce. Although PSA bounce by nadir + 0.2 (odds ratio 0.10; 95% confidence interval 0.04-0.24) and nadir + 2.0 (odds ratio 0.29; 95% confidence interval 0.09-0.93) was associated with a lower probability of PSA response at 4 years, there was no association between bounce by nadir + 0.2 (hazard ratio 0.36; 95% confidence interval 0.08-1.74) or nadir + 2 (hazard ratio 1.77; 95% confidence interval 0.28-11.07) with BFFS.  Conclusion:   The incidence of PSA bounce was independent of time-dose-fraction schedule for prostate SBRT. One in 13 patients experienced a bounce high enough to be misinterpreted as biochemical failure, and clinicians should avoid early salvage interventions in these patients.

We sought to determine how often DCE is used in PI-RADS v2 scoring.  Materials and methods:   We retrospectively reviewed data from 388 patients who underwent prostate magnetic resonance imaging and subsequent biopsy from January 2016 through December 2017. In accordance with PI-RADS v2, DCE was deemed necessary if a peripheral-zone lesion had a diffusion-weighted imaging score of 3, or if a transition-zone lesion had a T2 score of 3 and diffusion-weighted imaging experienced technical failure. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis assessed the accuracy of prostate-specific antigen density (PSAD) at different threshold values for differentiating lesions that would be equivocal with noncontrast technique. Accuracy of PSAD was compared to DCE using McNemar's test.  Results:   Sixty-nine lesions in 62 patients (16%) required DCE for PI-RADS scoring. Biopsy of 10 (14%) of these lesions showed clinically significant cancer (Gleason score ≥7). In the subgroup of patients with equivocal lesions, those with clinically significant cancer had significantly higher PSADs than those with clinically insignificant lesions (means of 0.18 and 0.13 ng/mL/mL, respectively; P= 0.038). In this subgroup, there was no statistical difference in accuracy in determining clinically significant cancer between a PSAD threshold value of 0.13 and DCE (P= 0.25).  Conclusions:   Only 16% of our patients needed DCE to generate the PI-RADS version 2 score, raising the possibility of limiting the initial screening prostate MRI to a noncontrast exam.

The current study aims to explore the anticancer effect of a treatment combining AR antagonist enzalutamide with USP14 inhibition on breast cancer cells.  Methods:   The combining effects of enzalutamide and USP14 inhibition on breast cancer cell proliferation and apoptosis and associated cell signaling were evaluated in vitro and in vivo.  Results:   USP14 inhibition via administration of IU1 or USP14-specific siRNA/shRNA enhanced cell growth inhibition and apoptosis induction by enzalutamide in breast cancer cell lines in vitro and in vivo. Additionally, the combination of enzalutamide with USP14 inhibition/knockdown induced significant downregulation of AR proteins and suppression of AR-related signaling pathways, including Wnt/β-catenin and PI3K/AKT pathways. Moreover, AKT inhibition via MK2206 increased the antiproliferative and proapoptotic effects of enzalutamide+IU1 combined treatment.

The purpose of this article is to provide summary descriptive data.  Methods:   An international, prospective cohort study recruited cancer patients in 26 hospitals in eight countries between April 2014 and March 2017. Target recruitment was 5300 patients. Eligible patients had breast, prostate or lung cancer and planned potentially curable radiotherapy. Radiotherapy was prescribed according to local regimens, but centres used standardised data collection forms. Pre-treatment blood samples were collected. Patients were followed for a minimum of 12 (lung) or 24 (breast/prostate) months and summary descriptive statistics were generated.  Results:   The study recruited 2069 breast (99% of target), 1808 prostate (86%) and 561 lung (51%) cancer patients. The centralised, accessible database includes: physician- (47,025 forms) and patient- (54,901) reported outcomes; 11,563 breast photos; 17,107 DICOMs and 12,684 DVHs. Imputed genotype data are available for 4223 patients with European ancestry (1948 breast, 1728 prostate, 547 lung). Radiation-induced lymphocyte apoptosis (RILA) assay data are available for 1319 patients. DNA (n = 4409) and PAXgene tubes (n = 3039) are stored in the centralised biobank. Example prevalences of 2-year (1-year for lung) grade ≥2 CTCAE toxicities are 13% atrophy (breast), 3% rectal bleeding (prostate) and 27% dyspnoea (lung).  Conclusion:   The comprehensive centralised database and linked biobank is a valuable resource for the radiotherapy community for validating predictive models and biomarkers.  Patient summary:   Up to half of cancer patients undergo radiation therapy and irradiation of surrounding healthy tissue is unavoidable. Damage to healthy tissue can affect short- and long-term quality-of-life. Not all patients are equally sensitive to radiation ""damage"" but it is not possible at the moment to identify those who are. REQUITE was established with the aim of trying to understand more about how we could predict radiation sensitivity. The purpose of this paper is to provide an overview and summary of the data and material available. In the REQUITE study 4400 breast, prostate and lung cancer patients filled out questionnaires and donated blood. A large amount of data was collected in the same way. With all these data and samples a database and biobank were created that showed it is possible to collect this kind of information in a standardised way across countries. In the future, our database and linked biobank will be a resource for research and validation of clinical predictors and models of radiation sensitivity.

We retrospectively measured LDN-PSA, total PSA (tPSA), and free PSA/tPSA (F/T PSA) values in 718 men who underwent a Pbx in 3 academic urology clinics in Japan and Canada (Pbx cohort) and in 174 PC patients who subsequently underwent radical prostatectomy in Australia (preop-PSA cohort). The assays were evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC) and decision curve analyses to discriminate CSPC. In the Pbx cohort, LDN-PSAD (AUC 0.860) provided significantly better clinical performance for discriminating CSPC compared with LDN-PSA (AUC 0.827, P = 0.0024), PSAD (AUC 0.809, P < 0.0001), tPSA (AUC 0.712, P < 0.0001), and F/T PSA (AUC 0.661, P < 0.0001).

Body mass index (BMI), lipid profile (total cholesterol [CHOL], triglycerides [TG], high-density lipoprotein [HDL], very-low-density lipoprotein [VLDL], low-density lipoprotein [LDL] and Castelli's risk index I [CR I] [TC/HDL]), oxidised LDL, apolipoprotein E, ceramide and PSA were determined. Mean ages for BPH, PCa and control were 69 ± 13, 67 ± 10 and 53 ± 7 years respectively. Most parameters apart from BMI and HDL were significantly different compared to the control group. oxLDL for BPH versus control, PCa versus control and BPH versus PCa was significant (p < 0.001, p = 0.02 and p < 0.001 respectively). Ceramide showed significant group differences. Between BPH and PCa, total cholesterol, LDL and Apo E were significantly different (p = 0.00, p = 0.01 and p = 0.03 respectively). Apo E could potentially be a discriminating biomarker. Receiver operating characteristic curves for TPSA, Apo E and oxLDL demonstrated sensitivity of 69.44 and specificity of 88.24 for oxLDL, hence more discriminatory.""","""['George Awuku Asare', 'Emmanunella Owusu-Boateng', 'Bernice Asiedu', 'Brodrick Yeboah Amoah', 'Eric Essendoh', 'Rabin Yitzhak Otoo']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Andrologia""","""['Diagnostic value of lipids, total antioxidants, and trace metals in benign prostate hyperplasia and prostate cancer.', 'Determination of alpha1-antichymotrypsin-PSA complex in serum does not improve the differentiation between benign prostatic hyperplasia and prostate cancer compared with total PSA and percent free PSA.', 'In prostatism patients the ratio of human glandular kallikrein to free PSA improves the discrimination between prostate cancer and benign hyperplasia within the diagnostic ""gray zone"" of total PSA 4 to 10 ng/mL.', 'EAU Guidelines on the Assessment of Non-neurogenic Male Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms including Benign Prostatic Obstruction.', 'Is COVID-19 a risk factor for progression of benign prostatic hyperplasia and exacerbation of its related symptoms?: a systematic review.', 'The tangled web of dyslipidemia and cancer: Is there any association?', 'Relationship between serum indirect bilirubin and prostate volume in patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia: a cross-sectional study.', 'Prostate Cancer-Focus on Cholesterol.', 'The Role of ApoE Expression and Variability of Its Glycosylation in Human Reproductive Health in the Light of Current Information.', 'Based on biomedical index data: Risk prediction model for prostate cancer.']"""

Materials and methods:   Within the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) database (1988-2015), we identified patients with localized PCa as an only or first primary cancer, who underwent BT or RP. Cumulative incidence plots and multivariable competing-risks regression (CRR) models were used. Sensitivity analyses focused on patients' age and year of diagnosis intervals and tested the effect of an unmeasured confounder.  Results:   Of 318 058 patients with localized prostate cancer (PCa), 55 566 (18.4%) underwent BT. After propensity score-matching, 20-year secondary BCa incidence was 6.0% in patients who had undergone BT vs 2.4% in those who had undergone RP (P < 0.001) and the respective 20-year secondary RCa incidence was 1.1% vs 0.5% (P < 0.001). In multivariable CRR models, BT predicted higher secondary BCa (hazard ratio [HR] 1.58; P < 0.001) and RCa rates (HR 1.59; P < 0.001) vs RP. Sensitivity analyses replicated the same results after stratification according to age and showed HRs of decreasing magnitude for historical, intermediate and contemporary years of diagnosis. An unmeasured confounder with an HR of 2 would render the effect of BT statistically insignificant if it affected patients in the RP group with a ratio of 2 relative to those in the BT group. Finally, temporal trends showed a decrease of secondary 5-year BCa and RCa rates.> CONCLUSIONS: Brachytherapy predominantly increases the risk of secondary BCa and, to a lesser extent, that of RCa.

Our objective was to describe our experience with fusion targeted prostate biopsy and assess whether it could obviate the need for concomitant standard 12-core template prostate biopsy.  Materials and methods:   We retrospectively reviewed our prospectively collected database of patients who underwent fusion transrectal ultrasound guided prostate biopsy. All images and lesions were graded according to the Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System, version 2. All patients underwent targeted biopsy followed by standard 12-core double sextant biopsy within the same session. Clinically significant prostate cancer was defined as Grade Group 2 or greater prostate cancer.  Results:   A total of 506 patients were included in analysis. Indications were elevated prostate specific antigen with a previous negative prostate biopsy in 46% of cases, prostate cancer on active surveillance in 35%, elevated prostate specific antigen without a prior prostate biopsy in 15% and an isolated abnormal digital rectal examination in 3%. For standard vs fusion prostate biopsy the overall cancer detection rate was 57.7% vs 54.0% (p=0.12) and the clinically significant prostate cancer detection rate was 24.7% vs 30.8% (p=0.001). Of the 185 patients diagnosed with clinically significant prostate cancer 29 (16%) would have been missed if only targeted fusion prostate biopsy had been performed.  Conclusions:   Fusion targeted prostate biopsy is associated with a higher detection rate of clinically significant prostate cancer compared to standard double sextant biopsy.

Prostate cancer offers a case study to examine how older men's masculinities are disrupted by chronic illness experience. Qualitative interviews with 29 men, recruited from two prostate cancer support groups, explored prostate cancer and post-treatment experiences. Men's experiences are examined by drawing on the works of Steve Robertson and Kathy Charmaz for understanding masculinities in relation to health and illness. Aspects of chronic illness experience are identified in men's accounts, particularly concerns with loss of moral status resulting from ongoing and potentially stigmatising treatment side effects. Four forms of moral positioning are identified that align with Steve Robertson's empirically derived model theorising the relationship between health and hegemonic masculinity. These findings facilitate discussion of the interaction between chronic illness experience, morality and masculinities, providing insight into how older men maintain their masculinity in the wake of illness.""","""['Richard Green']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Health (London)""","""[""Men, masculinities and diabetes: 'doing gender' in Italian men's narratives of chronic illness."", 'Moving beyond the prostate: benefits in broadening the scope of research on men and cancer.', '""Talk about it:"" changing masculinities and mental health in rural places?', ""Men's Views on Depression: A Systematic Review and Metasynthesis of Qualitative Research."", ""Men's Experiences of Mental Illness Stigma Across the Lifespan: A Scoping Review."", 'The impact of testicular cancer and its treatment on masculinity: A systematic review.', 'Supportive care needs of men with prostate cancer: A systematic review update.', 'Body image, self-esteem, and sense of masculinity in patients with prostate cancer: a qualitative meta-synthesis.']"""

The EDRE was condensed on the Ti3C2-TAT (Ti3C2-TAT@EDRE) by electrostatic interaction.

Consequently, fluorescence analysis of lncRNA PCA3 at low-picomolar concentrations in vitro as well as sensitive live cell imaging of lncRNA PCA3 in the nucleus of androgen receptor-positive LNCaP prostate cancer cells were achieved, providing a versatile strategy for the monitoring of nucleic acid biomarkers in the nucleus of living cells.""","""['Song Wang', 'Wenlu Song', 'Shaohua Wei', 'Shu Zeng', 'Sihui Yang', 'Chunyang Lei', 'Yan Huang', 'Zhou Nie', 'Shouzhuo Yao']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Anal Chem""","""['Correction to Functional Titanium Carbide MXenes-Loaded Entropy-Driven RNA Explorer for Long Noncoding RNA PCA3 Imaging in Live Cells.', 'Chimeric DNA-Functionalized Titanium Carbide MXenes for Simultaneous Mapping of Dual Cancer Biomarkers in Living Cells.', 'Correction to Functional Titanium Carbide MXenes-Loaded Entropy-Driven RNA Explorer for Long Noncoding RNA PCA3 Imaging in Live Cells.', 'PRUNE2 is a human prostate cancer suppressor regulated by the intronic long noncoding RNA PCA3.', 'A review on the role of PCA3 lncRNA in carcinogenesis with an especial focus on prostate cancer.', 'Long non-coding RNA: A newly deciphered ""code"" in prostate cancer.', 'MiRNAs and lncRNAs in NK cell biology and NK/T-cell lymphoma.', 'A turn-on-type fluorescence resonance energy transfer aptasensor for vibrio detection using aptamer-modified polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane-perovskite quantum dots/Ti3C2 MXenes composite probes.', 'Integrating CRISPR-Cas12a with a DNA circuit as a generic sensing platform for amplified detection of microRNA.']"""

Methods:   We used data from 994 participants (411 white, 583 African American) in a hospital-based cohort study of survivors diagnosed with breast, colorectal, lung, or prostate cancer since January 1, 2013. Financial hardship included decreased income, borrowing money, cancer-related debt, and accessing assets to pay for cancer care. Limiting care included skipping doses of prescribed medication, refusing treatment, or not seeing a doctor when needed due to cost. Logistic regression models controlled for sociodemographic factors.  Results:   More African American than white survivors reported financial hardship (50.3% vs. 41.0%, p = 0.005) and limiting care (20.0% vs. 14.2%, p = 0.019). More white than African American survivors reported utilizing assets (9.3% vs. 4.8%, p = 0.006), while more African American survivors reported cancer-related debt (30.5% vs. 18.5%, p < 0.001). Survivors who experienced financial hardship were 4.4 (95% CI: 2.9, 6.6) times as likely to limit care as those who did not. Borrowing money, cancer-related debt, and decreased income were each independently associated with limiting care, while accessing assets was not.  Conclusions:   The prevalence of some forms of financial hardship differed by race, and these were differentially associated with limiting care due to cost.

Methods:   In the HALFMOON technique, the CTV consisted of skin, subcutaneous tissues, and pectoralis major muscle, excluding the implant, chest wall muscles, and rib plane. The HALFMOON plans were compared with conventionally contoured CTV plans, in which the whole implant, chest wall muscles, and ribs plane were included in the CTV, in a ratio 1:3. All patients underwent hypofractionated treatment of 40.05 Gy/15 fractions, using helical Tomotherapy®.  Results:   Eighteen patients undergoing HALFMOON technique were compared to 54 subjects treated with conventionally contoured CTV plans. No difference was found in the planning target volume coverage between the two groups. Conversely, a statistically relevant dose reduction in HALFMOON patients was observed for ipsilateral lung (D15%, p < 0.0001; D20%, p < 0.0001; D35%, p = 0.003), contralateral lung (D20%, p = 0.048), contralateral breast (D15%, p = 0.031; D20%, p = 0.047), and stomach (Dmean, p = 0.011). Regarding the implant, V90% and D50% decreased by 46% and 8%, respectively, in the HALFMOON plans (p < 0.0001).

Serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and free PSA (fPSA) were measured preoperatively. Diagnostic value and accuracy was determined for MRI alone and MRI + SWE using the receiver operator characteristic curve (ROC) analysis.  Results:   MRI misdiagnosed 17.9% (21/117) clinically significant prostate cancers, including 15 lesions in the peripheral zone and 6 in the central zone. Both qualitative and quantitative SWE could help detect 66.7% (10/15) significant prostate cancers with false-negative MRI, but there was no association with the Gleason score (p > 0.05).

Methods: Data of 582 de novo mPCa patients between January 2011 and December 2017 diagnosed at Departments of Urology, West China Hospital, Sichuan University were retrospectively analyzed. The age was (70±8) years (range: 45 to 89 years). IDC-P was identified from 12-core prostate biopsy. The prognostic role of IDC-P was assessed by Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox regression. Subgroup analysis was conducted by the forest plot. The endpoints were castration-resistant prostate cancer free survival (CFS) and overall survival (OS). Results: In total, 177/582 (30.4%) patients harbored IDC-P. Patients with IDC-P had poorer CFS and OS than those without IDC-P (mCFS: 12.1 months vs. 16.9 months, P=0.000; mOS: 39.7 months vs. not reached, P=0.000). Multivariate Cox regression analysis indicated that, the existence of IDC-P was an independent prognosticator of both CFS (HR=1.40, 95% CI: 1.10 to 1.79, P=0.006) and OS (HR=1.51, 95% CI: 1.02 to 2.25, P=0.041). Subanalysis indicated that, in most subgroups, IDC-P was an adverse prognosticator of both CFS and OS. Even in subgroups with adverse clinicopathological features, e.g. Gleason score 9 to 10 (CFS: HR=1.467, P=0.007; OS: HR=1.807, P=0.013), baseline prostate specific antigen≥50 μg/L (CFS: HR=1.616, P=0.000; OS: HR=1.749, P=0.006), anemia (CFS: HR=1.653, P=0.036; OS: HR=2.100, P=0.038), alkaline phosphatase≥160 U/L (CFS: HR=1.326, P=0.038; OS: HR=1.725, P=0.010) or abnormal lactate dehydrogenase level (CFS: HR=1.614, P=0.001; OS: HR=1.900, P=0.003), IDC-P was still closely associated with shorter CFS and OS. Conclusions: The presence of IDC-P was closely related to poor survival outcomes for patients with mPCa. IDC-P was an adverse prognosticator in most subgroup patients.

Methods: From March 2015 to August 2017, 55 patients with high-volume metastatic hormone sensitive prostate cancer were enrolled at Department of Urology, Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center receiving chemotherapy combined with androgen-deprivation therapy. The age was 65(8) years (M(Q(R))) (range: 46 to 79 years). Patients were enrolled in the study for continuous androgen-deprivation therapy (medical or surgical castration), combined with docetaxel 75 mg/m(2) intravenous injection on the first day, repeated every 21 days (6 cycles). Endpoints included overall survival, progression-free survival of prostate cancer, prostate specific antigen (PSA) response rate, and adverse events.

However, the long-term effect of citrate treatment has not been investigated yet. Here, we address this question in PC3 cells, a prostate-cancer-derived cell line. Acute administration of high levels of extracellular citrate impaired cell adhesion and inhibited the proliferation of PC3 cells, but surviving cells adapted to grow in the chronic presence of 20 mM citrate. Citrate-resistant PC3 cells are significantly less glycolytic than control cells. Moreover, they overexpress short-form, citrate-insensitive phosphofructokinase 1 (PFK1) together with full-length PFK1. In addition, they show traits of mesenchymal-epithelial transition: an increase in E-cadherin and a decrease in vimentin. In comparison with PC3 cells, citrate-resistant cells display morphological changes that involve both microtubule and microfilament organization. This was accompanied by changes in homeostasis and the organization of intracellular organelles. Thus, the mitochondrial network appears fragmented, the Golgi complex is scattered, and the lysosomal compartment is enlarged. Interestingly, citrate-resistant cells produce less total ROS but accumulate more mitochondrial ROS than control cells. Consistently, in citrate-resistant cells, the autophagic pathway is upregulated, possibly sustaining their survival. In conclusion, chronic administration of citrate might select resistant cells, which could jeopardize the benefits of citrate anticancer treatment.""","""['Carmen Caiazza', ""Massimo D'Agostino"", 'Fabiana Passaro', 'Deriggio Faicchia', 'Massimo Mallardo', 'Simona Paladino', 'Giovanna Maria Pierantoni', 'Donatella Tramontano']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Int J Mol Sci""","""['The bifunctional autophagic flux by 2-deoxyglucose to control survival or growth of prostate cancer cells.', 'Down-regulation of E-cadherin enhances prostate cancer chemoresistance via Notch signaling.', 'A gonadotropin-releasing hormone-II antagonist induces autophagy of prostate cancer cells.', 'Inactivated Sendai Virus Induces ROS-dependent Apoptosis and Autophagy in Human Prostate Cancer Cells.', 'Novel role of zinc in the regulation of prostate citrate metabolism and its implications in prostate cancer.', 'The Lack of STING Impairs the MHC-I Dependent Antigen Presentation and JAK/STAT Signaling in Murine Macrophages.', 'Citric Acid as a Potential Prostate Cancer Biomarker Determined in Various Biological Samples.', 'Metabolites Profiling of Melanoma Interstitial Fluids Reveals Uridine Diphosphate as Potent Immune Modulator Capable of Limiting Tumor Growth.', 'Uncovering the Metabolic and Stress Responses of Human Embryonic Stem Cells to FTH1 Gene Silencing.', 'PD-L1 Expression Fluctuates Concurrently with Cyclin D in Glioblastoma Cells.']"""

However, research into the impact of ADT on body image is limited. Exercise can help patients to counterbalance some side-effects, potentially improving body image too. However, adherence to exercise recommendations is low. Therefore, we explored body image after ADT and attitudes towards exercise.  Methods:   Twenty two semi-structured interviews were conducted with PCa patients receiving ADT (Mage = 67.9 years old, SD = 9.99).  Results:   Participants expressed appearance dissatisfaction focusing on body feminization. Participants exercised to counterbalance ADT side-effects and improve mood. Exercise also helped them to re-establish a sense of control over their body and experience a sense of achievement. However, some men described being worried that their appearance and physical performance would be judged by others, so they often exercised alone or gave up exercise. Time management and fatigue were also identified as exercise barriers.  Conclusion:   These findings highlight the need to further investigate body image concerns and exercise barriers in PCa patients undergoing ADT.

We evaluated the recent transformation of EOL chemotherapy and targeted therapy practices nationally.  Methods:   In patients older than 65 years of age who died as a result of breast (n = 19,887), lung (n = 79,613), colorectal (n = 29,844), or prostate (n = 17,910) cancer between 2007 and 2013, we evaluated the guideline-benchmarked measure of chemotherapy use within 14 days of EOL in SEER-Medicare. Comparison outcomes were nonbenchmarked measures of chemotherapy and targeted therapy across time points within 6 months of EOL. Cochran-Armitage test was used to evaluate temporal trends. Multilevel logistic models and intraclass correlation coefficient was used to evaluate variation in EOL chemotherapy use at the physician level.  Results:   From 2007 to 2013, chemotherapy within 14 days of EOL declined from 6.7% to 4.9% of patients (Ptrend < .001; ∆ = -1.8%). Similar declines occurred for chemotherapy within 1 month (Ptrend < .001; ∆ = -1.8%) and 2 months (Ptrend < .001; ∆ = -1.3%) of EOL. In contrast, chemotherapy within 4 to 6 months of EOL rose (Ptrend ≤ .04; ∆ = 0.7% to 1.7%), and 43.0% of all patients received chemotherapy within 6 months of EOL. Frequency of targeted therapy use across all time points within 6 months of EOL was stable to marginally rising from 2007 to 2013 (Ptrend = .09 to .82; ∆ = -0.2% to 1.8%); overall, 1.2% received targeted therapy within 14 days and 3.6% within 1 month of EOL. By 2013, 13.2% of patients received any targeted therapy within 6 months of EOL. In a multilevel model, 5.19% (intraclass correlation coefficient) of variation in 14-day EOL chemotherapy was attributed to the physician level.

This was a descriptive observational study based on the nominal bank of the Brazilian Mortality Information System for the period from January 1st, 2000, to December 31st, 2012. The study analyzed the distribution death frequencies by sex and age. Standardized mortality ratio (SMR) was calculated taking Goiânia (Goiás State), Acre State, and the North Region of Brazil as the references. A total of 81 deaths were identified, the majority in men (59.3%) and in individuals over 70 years of age. The five main sites in men were stomach, liver, colon and rectum, leukemia, and prostate. The five main sites in women were uterine cervix, stomach, liver, leukemia, and uterus. In indigenous men there was an excess of deaths from stomach cancer compared to the populations of Goiânia (SMR = 2.72; 2.58-2.87), Acre State (SMR = 2.05; 1.94-2.16) and North region (SMR = 3.10; 2.93-3.27). The same was observed for deaths from hepatic cell carcinomas referenced against Goiânia (SMR = 3.89; 3.66-4.14), Acre State (SMR = 1.79; 1.68-1.91), and the North of Brazil (SMR = 4.04; 3.77-4.30). Among indigenous women, there was an excess of cervical cancer in comparison to Goiânia (SMR = 4.67; 4.41-4.93), Acre State (SMR = 2.12; 2.00-2.24), and the North (SMR = 2.60; 2.45-2.75). The estimates show that preventable neoplasms such as cervical cancer and those linked to underdevelopment, such as stomach and liver cancer, account for 49.4% of deaths among indigenous peoples. Compared to the reference population, mortality from liver, stomach, and colorectal cancer and leukemias was more than twice as high in indigenous men; among indigenous women, cervical, stomach, and liver cancer and leukemias were 30% higher.""","""['Maria Fernanda de Sousa Oliveira Borges', 'Sergio Koifman', 'Rosalina Jorge Koifman', 'Ilce Ferreira da Silva']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Cad Saude Publica""","""['Cancer incidence in indigenous populations of Western Amazon, Brazil.', 'Analysis of the mortality trend in the indigenous population of Brazil, 2000-2016.', 'Screening methodology application to evaluate cancer mortality in selected cities in the State of Minas Gerais, Brazil.', 'Social, demographic, and health policies history of indigenous peoples from the state of Acre, Brazil.', 'The Epidemiology of Stomach Cancer.']"""

Procedures:   Fifty patients who had been imaged with [18F]DCFPyL positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) were retrospectively included in this study. Forty of 50 (80 %) demonstrated radiotracer uptake on [18F]DCFPyL PET/CT compatible with sites of PCa. Volumes of interests (VOIs) were set on normal organs (lacrimal glands, parotid glands, submandibular glands, liver, spleen, and kidneys) and on tumor lesions. Mean standardized uptake values corrected to lean body mass (SULmean) and mean standardized uptake values corrected to body weight (SUVmean) for normal organs were assessed. For the entire tumor burden, SULmean/max, SUVmean, tumor volume (TV), and the total activity in the VOI were obtained using tumor segmentation. A Spearman's rank correlation coefficient was used to investigate correlations between normal organ uptake and tumor burden.  Results:   There was no significant correlation between TV with the vast majority of the investigated organs (lacrimal glands, parotid glands, submandibular glands, spleen, and liver). Only the kidney showed significant correlation: With an isocontour threshold at 50 %, left kidney uptake parameters correlated significantly with TV (SUVmean, ρ = - 0.214 and SULmean, ρ = - 0.176, p < 0.05, respectively).  Conclusions:   Only a minimal sink effect with high tumor burden in patients imaged with [18F]DCFPyL was observed.

Materials and methods:   Perioperative data from 375 consecutive patients who underwent endoscopic enucleation of the prostate (EEP) for benign prostatic obstruction between July 2013 and December 2018 were retrospectively reviewed. Patients were stratified into three groups according to the preoperative PSA level: low-PSA (< 4 ng/mL), intermediate-PSA (4 ≤ PSA < 10 ng/mL) and high-PSA (≥ 10 ng/mL). Men in each group were propensity score matched by age, 5α-reductase inhibitor (5-ARI) use, prostate volume and mpMRI. The TZ-PCa incidence rate was retrospectively compared by preoperative PSA level in a propensity score model including all predetermined variables.  Results:   Age, prostate volume, 5-ARI use were similar between patient groups. The median PSA levels in the low-, intermediate- and high-PSA groups were 3 [2.3; 3.4], 6.6 [5.3; 8.1] and 12.7 [11; 16.7] ng/mL, respectively. The median prostate volume was > 100 grams in all groups (108, 105 and 120 cc, respectively). The T1a-Gleason 6 incidental TZ-PCa rate was statistically comparable between the three groups (3.4, 5.1 and 8.6% in the low-, intermediate- and high-PSA groups, respectively). The detection rate of clinically significant TZ-PCa was low for preoperative PSA levels > 4 ng/mL (1.7%); with no difference between the intermediate- and high-PSA groups.  Conclusion:   In men with large glands, the clinically significant incidental TZ-PCa detection rate was similar regardless of the preoperative PSA level stratum.

We therefore aimed to tailor radiation treatment to the risk status by using three different hypofractionated radiation regimen differing in applied dose, use of rectum spacer, inclusion of pelvic lymph nodes (pLN) and use of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). Here we report on acute toxicity, quality of life (QOL) and oncologic outcome at a median follow-up of 12 months.  Methods:   A total of 221 consecutive PCA patients received hypofractionated intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT). Low-risk (LR) patients were planned to receive 60 Gy in 20 fractions (EQD2α/β1.5 = 77.1 Gy), intermediate-risk (IR) patients 63 Gy in 21 fractions (EQD2α/β1.5 = 81 Gy), and high-risk (HR) patients 67.5 Gy in 25 fractions (EQD2α/β1.5 = 81 Gy) to the prostate and 50 Gy in 25 fractions to the pLN. Acute rectal toxicity was assessed by endoscopy. In addition, toxicity was scored using CTC-AE 4.0 and IPSS score, while QOL was assessed using QLQ-PR25 questionnaires.  Results:   Acute CTC reactions were slightly higher in the HR regimen but reverted to baseline at 3 months. GI G2 toxicity was 4%, 0% and 12% for the LR, IR and HR regimen. Compared to IR patients, the increase in toxicity in HR patients was statistically significant (p = 0.002) and mainly caused by a higher incidence of diarrhea presumably due to pelvic EBRT. QOL scores of all domains were worse for the HR regimen (not significant).  Conclusion:   Risk-adapted moderate hypofractionation is associated with low GI/GU toxicity. Given the higher rate of pelvic metastases in HR patients, slightly higher transient acute reactions should be outweighed by possible oncological benefits.""","""['Andreas Schörghofer', 'Michael Groher', 'Josef Karner', 'Andrea Kopp', 'Gerhard Kametriser', 'Thomas Kunit', 'Josef Holzinger', 'Felix Sedlmayer', 'Frank Wolf']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Strahlenther Onkol""","""['Acute toxicity in high-risk prostate cancer patients treated with androgen suppression and hypofractionated intensity-modulated radiotherapy.', 'Ten-Year Outcomes of Moderately Hypofractionated (70\xa0Gy in 28 fractions) Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy for Localized Prostate Cancer.', 'Ultra-hypofractionated versus conventionally fractionated radiotherapy for prostate cancer (HYPO-RT-PC): patient-reported quality-of-life outcomes of a randomised, controlled, non-inferiority, phase 3 trial.', 'Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy for High-Risk Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Review.', 'Moderate Hypofractionated Radiotherapy for Localized Prostate Cancer: The Triumph of Radiobiology.', 'Patterns of care for prostate cancer radiotherapy-results from a\xa0survey among German-speaking radiation oncologists.', 'Treatment of low-risk prostate cancer: a\xa0retrospective study with 477\xa0patients comparing external beam radiotherapy and I-125 seeds brachytherapy in terms of biochemical control and late side effects.', 'Moderately HRT vs. CRT for localized prostate cancer using image-guided VMAT with SIB: evaluation of acute and late toxicities.']"""

Results:   We identified that overexpression of BTF3 in PCa tissues and BTF3 expression highly correlates to stem-like traits. Cancer stem-like characteristics in PCa including self-renewal and metastatic potential were impaired by BTF3 loss and promoted by BTF3 overexpression. Mechanistically, BTF3 could stabilize BMI1, which is a crucial regulator of prostate stem cell self-renewal. More importantly, our data revealed that BTF3 is highly predictive of poor prognosis and may help in risk stratification of PCa patients.

These trial designs allow both (1) seamless addition of new research comparisons and (2) early stopping of accrual to individual comparisons that do not show sufficient activity. FOCUS4 (colorectal cancer) and STAMPEDE (prostate cancer), run from the Medical Research Council Clinical Trials Unit (CTU) at UCL, are two leading UK examples of clinical trials implementing adaptive platform protocol designs. To date, STAMPEDE has added five new research comparisons, closed two research comparisons following pre-planned interim analysis (lack of benefit), adapted the control arm following results from STAMPEDE and other relevant trials, and completed recruitment to six research comparisons. FOCUS4 has closed one research comparison following pre-planned interim analysis (lack of benefit) and added one new research comparison, with a number of further comparisons in the pipeline. We share our experiences from the operational aspects of running these adaptive trials, focusing on data management.  Methods:   We held discussion groups with STAMPEDE and FOCUS4 CTU data management staff to identify data management challenges specific to adaptive platform protocols. We collated data on a number of case report form (CRF) changes, database amendments and database growth since each trial began.  Discussion:   We found similar adaptive protocol-specific challenges in both trials. Adding comparisons to and removing them from open trials provides extra layers of complexity to CRF and database development. At the start of an adaptive trial, CRFs and databases must be designed to be flexible and scalable in order to cope with the continuous changes, ensuring future data requirements are considered where possible. When adding or stopping a comparison, the challenge is to incorporate new data requirements while ensuring data collection within ongoing comparisons is unaffected. Some changes may apply to all comparisons; others may be comparison-specific or applicable only to patients recruited during a specific time period. We discuss the advantages and disadvantages of the different approaches to CRF and database design we implemented in these trials, particularly in relation to use and maintenance of generic versus comparison-specific CRFs and databases. The work required to add or remove a comparison, including the development and testing of changes, updating of documentation, and training of sites, must be undertaken alongside data management of ongoing comparisons. Adequate resource is required for these competing data management tasks, especially in trials with long follow-up. A plan is needed for regular and pre-analysis data cleaning for multiple comparisons that could recruit at different rates and periods of time. Data-cleaning activities may need to be split and prioritised, especially if analyses for different comparisons overlap in time.  Conclusions:   Adaptive trials offer an efficient model to run randomised controlled trials, but setting up and conducting the data management activities in these trials can be operationally challenging. Trialists and funders must plan for scalability in data collection and the resource required to cope with additional competing data management tasks.""","""['Dominic Hague', 'Stephen Townsend', 'Lindsey Masters', 'Mary Rauchenberger', 'Nadine Van Looy', 'Carlos Diaz-Montana', 'Melissa Gannon', 'Nicholas James', 'Tim Maughan', 'Mahesh K B Parmar', 'Louise Brown', 'Matthew R Sydes;STAMPEDE and FOCUS investigators']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Trials""","""['This is a platform alteration: a trial management perspective on the operational aspects of adaptive and platform and umbrella protocols.', 'Flexible trial design in practice - stopping arms for lack-of-benefit and adding research arms mid-trial in STAMPEDE: a multi-arm multi-stage randomized controlled trial.', 'Molecular selection of therapy in metastatic colorectal cancer: the FOCUS4 molecularly stratified RCT Internet.', 'Adding new experimental arms to randomised clinical trials: Impact on error rates.', 'Comparison of multi-arm multi-stage design and adaptive randomization in platform clinical trials.', 'Using the AR-V7 biomarker to determine treatment in metastatic castrate resistant prostate cancer, a feasibility randomised control trial, conclusions from the VARIANT trial version 2; peer review: 2 approved.', 'Online error rate control for platform trials.', 'Practical guidance for running late-phase platform protocols for clinical trials: lessons from experienced UK clinical trials units.', 'Practical guidance for planning resources required to support publicly-funded adaptive clinical trials.', 'Economic Evaluation of Cost and Time Required for a Platform Trial vs Conventional Trials.']"""

Radiotherapy represents one major treatment option in different therapeutic settings. As patients increasingly rely on internet-based medical information, we examined the quality of information on radiotherapy and prostate cancer in websites used by laypersons.  Methods:   An Internet search from a patients` perspective was carried out using different search engines (Google, Yahoo and Bing, search terms: ""prostate cancer"" and ""radiotherapy""). The quality of search results was analyzed with regard to the DISCERN score, HON code certification, the JAMA criteria and the ALEXA traffic rank.  Results:   In general, websites were of good quality. The highest quality was found for websites operated by charity organizations. No significant differences in results obtained via the above-mentioned tools were seen for the examined search engines, but Google revealed the most stable search results in terms of temporal changes.  Conclusion:   Patients with prostate cancer can sufficiently inform themselves on general treatment options including radiotherapy on websites directed at laypersons. However, no simple strategy could identify high quality websites in general.

Metformin (MET), a drug widely used for type 2 diabetes, has recently gained interest for treating several cancers. Recent studies indicated that the anti-proliferative effects of metformin in cancer cells are highly dependent on glucose concentration. The present work was directed to determine whether use of a specific inhibitor of HO-1 activity, alone or in combination with metformin, affected metastatic prostate cancer cell viability under different concentrations of glucose. MTT assay and the xCELLigence system were used to evaluate cell viability and cell proliferation in DU145 human prostate cancer cells. Cell apoptosis and reactive oxygen species were analyzed by flow cytometry. The activity of HO-1 was inhibited using a selective imidazole-based inhibitor; genes associated with antioxidant systems and cell death were evaluated by qRT-PCR. Our study demonstrates that metformin suppressed prostate cancer growth in vitro and increased oxidative stress. Disrupting the antioxidant HO-1 activity, especially under low glucose concentration, could be an attractive approach to potentiate metformin antineoplastic effects and could provide a biochemical basis for developing HO-1-targeting drugs against solid tumors.""","""['Marco Raffaele', 'Valeria Pittalà', 'Veronica Zingales', 'Ignazio Barbagallo', 'Loredana Salerno', 'Giovanni Li Volti', 'Giuseppe Romeo', 'Giuseppe Carota', 'Valeria Sorrenti', 'Luca Vanella']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Int J Mol Sci""","""['Metformin Sensitizes Non-small Cell Lung Cancer Cells to an Epigallocatechin-3-Gallate (EGCG) Treatment by Suppressing the Nrf2/HO-1 Signaling Pathway.', 'Combined inhibition of Hsp90 and heme oxygenase-1 induces apoptosis and endoplasmic reticulum stress in melanoma.', 'Cross-talk between two antioxidants, thioredoxin reductase and heme oxygenase-1, and therapeutic implications for multiple myeloma.', 'Heme oxygenase-1 enhances autophagy in podocytes as a protective mechanism against high glucose-induced apoptosis.', 'Heme oxygenase-1: A new druggable target in the management of chronic and acute myeloid leukemia.', 'Evaluation of the Antioxidant and Antiangiogenic Activity of a Pomegranate Extract in BPH-1 Prostate Epithelial Cells.', 'Pharmacological Significance of Heme Oxygenase 1 in Prostate Cancer.', 'Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus CA15 (DSM 33960) as a Candidate Probiotic Strain for Human Health.', 'Comparative Proteomics Analysis Reveals the Reversal Effect of Cryptotanshinone on Gefitinib-Resistant Cells in Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor-Mutant Lung Cancer.', 'Metformin and Cancer Hallmarks: Molecular Mechanisms in Thyroid, Prostate and Head and Neck Cancer Models.']"""

Abiraterone and enzalutamide are oral therapies approved for the treatment of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, a disease most commonly treated by medical oncologists.  Methods:   Using the Medicare Part D Public Use Files from 2013 to 2016, we identified total abiraterone and enzalutamide prescriptions 2013-2016 and urologists who prescribed moderate to high volumes of these drugs. We then characterized the urologist practices of those urologists according to practice context (eg, single-specialty group) using data from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, and the geographic distribution of those providers.  Results:   We found abiraterone prescriptions increased from 71,423 in 2013 to a peak of 100,371 in 2015 and enzalutamide prescriptions continued to increase from 29,572 in 2013 to 100,980 in 2016. Prescriptions by urologists increased between 2013 and 2016 while prescriptions by other specialties plateaued. The number of moderate-high prescribing urologists increased from 98 (abiraterone) and 22 (enzalutamide) in 2013, to 301 (abiraterone) and 671 (enzalutamide) by 2016 with 1063 unique urologists prescribing moderate-high volumes of either drug between 2013 and 2016. Among urologists who prescribe androgen deprivation therapy, 5% were moderate-high prescribers of abiraterone and 12% of enzalutamide in 2016. The majority of moderate-high prescribing urologists were in single-specialty groups (70%).

Ligand-targeted drugs (LTDs) are a promising class of targeted anticancer agents. The hydrophilicity of the targeting ligands in LTDs limits its nonselective passive tissue distribution and toxicity to healthy cells. In addition, the small size of LTDs allows for better tumor penetration, especially in the case of solid tumors. However, the short circulation half-life of LTDs, due to their hydrophilicity and small size, remains a significant challenge for achieving their full therapeutic potential. Therefore, extending the circulation half-life of targeted chemotherapeutic agents while maintaining their hydrophilicity and small size will represent a significant advance toward effective and safe cancer treatment. Here, we present a new approach for enhancing the safety and efficacy of targeted chemotherapeutic agents. By endowing hydrophobic chemotherapeutic agents with a targeting moiety and a hydrophilic small molecule that binds reversibly to the serum protein transthyretin, we generated small hydrophilic drug conjugates that displayed enhanced circulation half-life in rodents and selectivity to cancer cells. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of a successful approach that maintains the small size and hydrophilicity of targeted anticancer agents containing hydrophobic payloads while at the same time extending their circulation half-life.

Methods:   We conducted a pharmacodynamic study (NCT02204943) of radium-223 in men with bone mCRPC. Prior to and three and six months after radium-223 treatment initiation, we collected CTCs and metastatic biopsies for phenotypic characterization and CTC genomic analysis. The primary objective was to describe the impact of radium-223 on the prevalence of CTC B-ALP over time. We measured radium-223 decay products in tumor and surrounding normal bone during treatment. We validated genomic findings in a separate independent study of men with bone metastatic mCRPC (n = 45) and publicly accessible data of metastatic CRPC tissues.  Results:   We enrolled 20 men with symptomatic bone predominant mCRPC and treated with radium-223. We observed greater radium-223 radioactivity levels in metastatic bone tumor containing biopsies compared with adjacent normal bone. We found evidence of persistent Cellsearch CTCs and B-ALP (+) CTCs in the majority of men over time during radium-223 therapy despite serum B-ALP normalization. We identified genomic gains in osteoblast mimicry genes including gains of ALPL, osteopontin, SPARC, OB-cadherin and loss of RUNX2, and validated genomic alterations or increased expression at the DNA and RNA level in an independent cohort of 45 men with bone-metastatic CRPC and in 150 metastatic biopsies from men with mCRPC.

To better understand the genetic and biological regulatory mechanisms of prostate cancer, we conducted a meta-analysis of three major pathways i.e. androgen receptor (AR), mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) and Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase (MAPK) on prostate cancer. Meta-analysis has been performed for the gene expression data for the human species that are exposed to prostate cancer. Twelve datasets comprising AR, mTOR, and MAPK pathways were taken for analysis, out of which thirteen potential biomarkers were identified through meta-analysis. These findings were compiled based upon the quantitative data analysis by using different tools. Also, various interconnections were found amongst the pathways in study.

The Da Vinci (Intuitive Surgical, Sunnyvale, CA) system was first introduced in Brazil in 2008, with a fast growing number of surgeries performed each year.  Objective:   Our primary endpoint is to analyze possible predictors of functional outcomes, related to patient and tumor features. As secondary endpoint, describe functional outcomes (urinary continence and sexual potency) from RARP performed in the Sírio-Libanês Hospital (SLH), a private institution, in São Paulo, from April 2008 to December 2015.  Materials and method:   Data from 104 consecutive patients operated by two surgeons from the SLH (MA and SA) between 2008 and 2015, with a minimum 12 months follow-up, were collected. Patient features (age, body mass index - BMI, PSA, date of surgery and sexual function), tumor features (tumor stage, Gleason and surgical margins) and followup data (time to reach urinary continence and sexual potency) were the variables collected at 1, 3, 6 and 12 month and every 6 months thereafter. Continence was defined as the use of no pad on medical interview and sexual potency defined as the capability for vaginal penetration with or without fosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors.

Individual variation in patient anatomy is a key contributor. This study aimed to create a model to determine the probability of rectum and/or bladder doses exceeding planning goals based on individual patient anatomy prior to planning.  Methods:   The IMRT/VMAT PPRT plans from 200 men were randomly and evenly allocated into the Training Cohort and the Validation Cohort. Univariate and multivariate analysis of the Training Cohort identified variables which impacted bladder and rectal doses. Significant variables were included in a Classification and Regression Tree (CART) analysis. The resultant algorithm was then applied to the Validation Cohort.  Results:   On multivariate analysis, prescription dose; bladder and rectal volume; lymph node treatment; and percentage of bladder and rectal overlap with the PTV were significant variables. Following CART analysis, the overlap volume (OV) for both rectum (rectum overlap > 20%) and bladder (bladder overlap > 20%) were the key drivers of meeting planning goals. Treatment of pelvic lymph nodes was included as the secondary driving factor for bladder (but not rectal) dose. On application to the Validation Cohort, CART analysis predicted 95% and 87% of patients who would meet bladder and rectal planning goals respectively.  Conclusions:   A simple algorithm was developed to predict plan quality by using the OV of the bladder and rectum with the PTV. This algorithm may be used a priori to assess the planning process in the context of variable anatomy, and to optimise planning quality and efficiency.""","""['Natalie Collier', 'Andrew Kneebone', 'George Hruby', 'Philip McCloud', 'Jeremy Booth', 'Thomas Eade']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""J Med Imaging Radiat Oncol""","""['Using individual patient anatomy to predict protocol compliance for prostate intensity-modulated radiotherapy.', 'Relationship between pelvic organ-at-risk dose and clinical target volume in postprostatectomy patients receiving intensity-modulated radiotherapy.', 'An improved distance-to-dose correlation for predicting bladder and rectum dose-volumes in knowledge-based VMAT planning for prostate cancer.', 'Treatment planning comparison of IMPT, VMAT and 4π radiotherapy for prostate cases.', 'Automated Radiotherapy Treatment Planning.', 'Dose Prediction Models Based on Geometric and Plan Optimization Parameter for Adjuvant Radiotherapy Planning Design in Cervical Cancer Radiotherapy.']"""

Our registration proceeded sequentially, i.e. global registration including affine and piece-wise affine transformation followed by local registration. As a local registration, Laplacian-based and finite element method-based registration was implemented in Algorithm A and B, respectively. Algorithm C was for global registration alone. The template models for the prostate, seminal vesicles, rectum and bladder were constructed from the first 20 patients, and then three different registrations were performed on these organs for the remaining 200 patients, to assess registration accuracy. The 75th percentile Hausdorff distance was <1 mm in Algorithm A; it was >1 mm in Algorithm B, except for the prostate; and 3.9 mm for the prostate and >7.8 mm for other organs in Algorithm C. The median computation time to complete registration was <101, 30 and 16 s in Algorithms A, B and C, respectively.

However, positive labelling for TTF-1 can occur in tumors from other sites, and this can result in misdiagnosis if only a limited panel of antibodies is used.

We also analyzed the expression of TTF-1 in a tissue microarray of 112 prostatic adenocarcinomas. The association of TTF-1 expression with clinicopathologic parameters and patient survival was analyzed. Six of 104 (5.7%) primary colorectal carcinomas expressed TTF-1 with SPT24 and SP141 clones, whereas only 2 (2%) of these tumors labeled positive for TTF-1 with clone 8G7G3/1. A significant association of TTF-1 expression with younger age at diagnosis (P=0.001) was found, but not with stage, or survival. The SP141 clone also labelled 24/165 (14.5%) of 165 CRC with known MSI status. There was an association with younger age (P<0.001), but not with MSI status or survival. TTF-1 expression was found in 39/112 (34%) prostate adenocarcinomas with 6/112 (5.3%) labelling with clone 8G7G3/1, 26/112 (23%) with clone SP141, and 31/112 (28%) with clone SPT24. TTF-1 expression appeared to be associated with extracapsular extension (P=0.022) and with higher stage (P=0.039). Here too TTF-1 expression was not associated with survival. The mRNA expression of TTF-1 in these tumors was confirmed by RTPCR, indicating that this is not false-positive labelling.

Transperineal in-bore MRI-guided prostate biopsy (tpMRgBx) is a targeted biopsy technique that was shown to be safe, efficient, and accurate. Our goal was to develop an open source software platform to support evaluation, refinement, and translation of this biopsy approach.  Methods:   We developed SliceTracker, a 3D Slicer extension to support tpMRgBx. We followed modular design of the implementation to enable customization of the interface and interchange of image segmentation and registration components to assess their effect on the processing time, precision, and accuracy of the biopsy needle placement. The platform and supporting documentation were developed to enable the use of software by an operator with minimal technical training to facilitate translation. Retrospective evaluation studied registration accuracy, effect of the prostate segmentation approach, and re-identification time of biopsy targets. Prospective evaluation focused on the total procedure time and biopsy targeting error (BTE).  Results:   Evaluation utilized data from 73 retrospective and ten prospective tpMRgBx cases. Mean landmark registration error for retrospective evaluation was 1.88 ± 2.63 mm, and was not sensitive to the approach used for prostate gland segmentation. Prospectively, we observed target re-identification time of 4.60 ± 2.40 min and BTE of 2.40 ± 0.98 mm.

This study investigated if miR-26a and PTEN dysregulation played a role in proliferation and apoptosis of PC-3 cells. Materials and Methods: PC tumor tissues were collected along with benign prostate hyperplasia samples. Expression of miR-26a and PTEN was detected. The targeted relationship between miR-26a and PTEN was analyzed by dual-luciferase reporter gene assay. In vitro-cultured PC-3 cells were treated with miR-26a inhibitor and/or pIRES2-PTEN. Flow cytometry was employed to detect cell apoptosis, cycle, and Ki-67 expression. Expression of miR-26a and PTEN was analyzed. Western blot was employed to detect protein levels of p-AKT, p-FoxO3a, and p27Kip1. Results: PC tissues had elevated miR-26a expression and lower PTEN expression compared with benign hyperplasia. miR-26a targeted and inhibited PTEN expression. Transfection of miR-26a inhibitor and/or overexpression of PTEN significantly decreased phosphorylation activity of AKT and FoxO3a, enhanced p27Kip1 expression, cell apoptosis, weakened proliferation ability, and arrested cell cycle at G0/G1 phase.

Here, we investigated the role of PKM2 in regulating autophagy and its associated pathways in prostate cancer cells.  Methods:   Immunohistochemistry was performed to compare the expression level of PKM2 in prostate cancer patients and normal human, whereas expression of PKM2 in several cell lines was also examined by using western blot. PKM2 expression was silenced using various small interfering RNAs (siRNAs). Cell viability was examined using IncuCyte ZOOM™ live cell imaging system. Western blotting and immunofluorescence were performed to investigate the PKM2 knockdown on other cellular signaling molecules. Acridine orange and Monodansylcadaverine staining was performed to check effect of PKM2 knockdown on autophagy induction. High performance thin layer chromatography was carried out to quantify the level of different cellular metabolites (pyruvate and lactate). Colony formation assay was performed to determine the ability of a cells to form large colonies.  Results:   PKM2 was highly expressed in prostate cancer patients as compared to normal human. PKM2 siRNA-transfected prostate cancer cells showed significantly reduced viability. Acridine orange, Monodansylcadaverine staining and western blotting analysis showed that PKM2 downregulation markedly increased autophagic cell death. Results of western blotting analysis showed that PKM2 knockdown affected protein kinase B/mechanistic target of rapamycin 1 pathway, which consequently downregulated the expression of glycolytic enzymes lactate dehydrogenase A and glucose transporter 1. Knockdown of PKM2 also reduced the colony formation ability of human prostate cancer cell DU145.

Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACis) disrupt cytoplasmic AR chaperone heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) via HDAC6 inhibition, leading to AR degradation and growth suppression of prostate cancer (PCa) cells. However, current HDACis are not effective in clinical trials treating CRPC.  Methods:   We designed hybrid molecules containing partial chemical scaffolds of AR antagonist enzalutamide (Enz) and HDACi suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) as new anti-PCa agents. We previously demonstrated that Enz-HDACi hybrid drug 2-75 targets both AR and Hsp90, which inhibits the growth of Enz-resistant C4-2 cells. In the current study, we further investigate the molecular and cellular actions of 2-75 and test its anti-PCa effects in vivo.  Results:   Compared with Enz, 2-75 had greater AR antagonistic effects by decreasing the stability, transcriptional activity, and nuclear translocation of intracellular AR. In addition to inhibition of full-length AR (FL AR), 2-75 downregulated the AR-V7 variant in multiple PCa cell lines. Mechanistic studies indicated that the AR affinity of 2-75 retains the drug in the cytoplasm of AR + PCa cells and further directs 2-75 to the AR-associated protein complex, which permits localized effects on AR-associated Hsp90. Further, unlike pan-HDACi SAHA, the cytoplasm-retaining property allows 2-75 to significantly inhibit cytoplasmic HDAC6 with limited impact on nuclear HDACs. These selective cytoplasmic actions of 2-75 overcome the unfavorable resistance and toxicity properties associated with classical AR antagonists, HDACis, and Hsp90 inhibitors. Finally, 2-75 showed greater antitumor activities than Enz in vivo on SQ xenografts derived from LNCaP cells.

Despite extensive studies of its phenotypic and genetic properties in Western populations, its molecular basis is not clear in Chinese patients. To determine critical molecular characteristics and explore correlations between genomic markers and clinical parameters in Chinese populations, we applied an integrative genetic/transcriptomic assay that combines targeted next-generation sequencing and quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) on samples from 46 Chinese patients with PCa. Lysine (K)-specific methyltransferase 2D (KMT2D), zinc finger homeobox 3 (ZFHX3), A-kinase anchoring protein 9 (AKAP9), and GLI family zinc finger 1 (GLI1) were frequently mutated in our cohort. Moreover, a clinicopathological analysis showed that RB transcriptional corepressor 1 (RB1) deletion was common in patients with a high risk of disease progression. Remarkably, four genomic events, MYC proto-oncogene (MYC) amplification, RB1 deletion, APC regulator of WNT signaling pathway (APC) mutation or deletion, and cyclin-dependent kinase 12 (CDK12) mutation, were correlated with poor disease-free survival. In addition, a close link between KMT2D expression and the androgen receptor (AR) signaling pathway was observed both in our cohort and in The Cancer Genome Atlas Prostate Adenocarcinoma (TCGA-PRAD) data.

Materials and methods:   Addressing aim (i), the neuro-regenerative potential, organotypic cultures derived from primary sympathetic ganglia were cultured on CS-Me over 3 days and neurite extension and axonal sprouting were evaluated. Addressing aim (ii), effects of CS on cancer cells, different human prostate cancer cell lines (PC3, DU-145, LN-Cap) were seeded on CS-coated plates or cultured in the presence of CS-Me dissolution products. Addressing aims (iii) and (iv), functional recovery of peripheral nerve fibres and tissue reaction with the biomaterial, CS-Me and CS nerve guides were used to repair a median nerve injury in the rat. Functional recovery was evaluated during the post-recovery time by the behavioural grasping test.  Results:   CS-Me significantly stimulated axon elongation from autonomic ganglia in comparison to control conditions in organotypic three-dimensional cultures. CS coating, as well as the dissolution products of CS-Me, led to a significantly lower proliferation rate of prostate cancer cell lines in vitro. Tissue reaction towards CS-Me and standard CS nerve guides was similar in the rat median nerve model, as was the outcome of nerve fibre regeneration and functional recovery.  Conclusion:   The results of this study provide the first experimental evidence in support of the clinical safety of CS-Me and of their postulated effectiveness for improving functional recovery after RP. The presented results are coherent in demonstrating that acutely axotomised autonomic neurones show increased neurite outgrowth on CS-Me substrate, whilst the same substrate reduces prostate cancer cell line proliferation in vitro.

Additionally, we used gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA), Gene Ontology (GO) analysis, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis and a protein-protein interaction network to demonstrate that miR-3607 affects the DDR pathway. Luciferase reporter and apoptosis assays confirmed that DNA damage inducible 1 homolog 2 (DDI2) is the functional target of miR-3607.

Methods: 161Tb was used for the radiolabeling of PSMA-617 at high specific activities up to 100 MBq/nmol. 161Tb-PSMA-617 was tested in vitro and in tumor-bearing mice to confirm equal properties, as previously determined for 177Lu-PSMA-617. The effects of 161Tb-PSMA-617 and 177Lu-PSMA-617 on cell viability (MTT assay) and survival (clonogenic assay) were compared in vitro using PSMA-positive PC-3 PIP tumor cells. 161Tb-PSMA-617 was further investigated in therapy studies using PC-3 PIP tumor-bearing mice.  Results: 161Tb-PSMA-617 and 177Lu-PSMA-617 displayed equal in-vitro properties and tissue distribution profiles in tumor-bearing mice. The viability and survival of PC-3 PIP tumor cells were more reduced when exposed to 161Tb-PSMA-617 as compared to the effect obtained with the same activities of 177Lu-PSMA-617 over the whole investigated concentration range. Treatment of mice with 161Tb-PSMA-617 (5.0 MBq/mouse and 10 MBq/mouse, respectively) resulted in an activity-dependent increase of the median survival (36 vs 65 days) compared to untreated control animals (19 days). Therapy studies to compare the effects of 161Tb-PSMA-617 and 177Lu-PSMA-617 indicated the anticipated superiority of 161Tb over 177Lu.  Conclusion: 161Tb-PSMA-617 showed superior in-vitro and in-vivo results as compared to 177Lu-PSMA-617, confirming theoretical dose calculations that indicate an additive therapeutic effect of conversion and Auger electrons in the case of 161Tb.

Thematic analysis of interviews was undertaken, informed by a previously developed theory of adjustment to cancer.  Results:   A total of 3986 (23.8%) respondents were on AS/WW. Overall, psychological outcomes were similar or better in men on AS/WW compared with those receiving AT (SWEMWBS: Poor well-being; 12.3% AS/WW vs 13.9% AT, adjusted OR = 0.86, 95% CI, 0.76-0.97; K6: severe psychological distress; 4.6% vs 5.4%, adjusted OR = 0.90, 95% CI, 0.74-1.08). Interviews indicated that most men on AS/WW had adjusted positively. Men with poorer well-being were less able to accept, reframe positively and normalise their diagnosis, described receiving insufficient information and support, and reported a lack of confidence in their health care professionals.  Conclusions:   Most men on AS/WW cope well psychologically. Men making treatment decisions should be given this information. Psychological health should be assessed to determine suitability for AS/WW, and at monitoring appointments. A clear action plan and support from health care professionals is important.""","""['Lauren Matheson', 'Sarah Wilding', 'Richard Wagland', 'Johana Nayoan', 'Carol Rivas', 'Amy Downing', 'Penny Wright', 'Jo Brett', 'Therese Kearney', 'William Cross', 'Adam Glaser', 'Anna Gavin', 'Eila Watson']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Psychooncology""","""['Long-term Psychological and Quality-of-life Effects of Active Surveillance and Watchful Waiting After Diagnosis of Low-risk Localised Prostate Cancer.', 'Cancer-related symptoms, mental well-being, and psychological distress in men diagnosed with prostate cancer treated with androgen deprivation therapy.', 'Patient perspective on watchful waiting/active surveillance for localized prostate cancer.', 'Radical prostatectomy versus watchful waiting for prostate cancer.', 'Patient reported factors influencing the decision-making process of men with localised prostate cancer when considering Active Surveillance-A systematic review and thematic synthesis.', 'Examining anxiety and depression in haematology cancer patients in ongoing treatment and under watchful waiting: A systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Supportive care needs of men with prostate cancer: A systematic review update.', 'Strategies adopted by men to deal with uncertainty and anxiety when following an active surveillance/monitoring protocol for localised prostate cancer and implications for care: a longitudinal qualitative study embedded within the ProtecT trial.', 'Why men with a low-risk prostate cancer select and stay on active surveillance: A qualitative study.']"""

However, beside artemisinin, less is known about the possible bioactive ingredients of Artemisia annua and respective herbal preparations. We hypothesized that, in addition to artemisinin, Artemisia annua preparations might contain multiple ingredients with potential anticancer activity.  Methods:   MDA-MB-231 triple negative human breast cancer (TNBC) cells along with other treatment resistant, metastatic cancer cell lines were used to investigate in vitro and in vivo the anticancer efficacy of an Artemisia annua extract marketed as a herbal preparation, which contained no detectable artemisinin (limit of detection = 0.2 ng/mg). The extract was characterized by HPLC-DAD and the most abundant compounds were identified by 1H- and 13C NMR spectroscopy and quantified by UHPLC-MS/MS. Cell viability and various apoptotic parameters were quantified by flow cytometry. In vitro data were validated in two in vivo cancer models, the chick chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) assay and in orthotopic breast cancer xenografts in nude mice.  Results:   The Artemisia annua extract, the activity of which could be enhanced by acetonitrile maceration, inhibited the viability of breast (MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7), pancreas (MIA PaCa-2), prostate (PC-3), non-small cell lung cancer (A459) cells, whereas normal mammary epithelial cells, lymphocytes, and PBMC were relatively resistant to extract treatment. Likewise, the extract's most abundant ingredients, chrysosplenol D, arteannuin B, and casticin, but not arteannuic acid or 6,7-dimethoxycoumarin, inhibited the viability of MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. The extract induced accumulation of multinucleated cancer cells within 24 h of treatment, increased the number of cells in the S and G2/M phases of the cell cycle, followed by loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, caspase 3 activation, and formation of an apoptotic hypodiploid cell population. Further, the extract inhibited cancer cell proliferation, decreased tumor growth, and induced apoptosis in vivo in TNBC MDA-MB-231 xenografts grown on CAM as well as in nude mice.  Conclusion:   An extract of an artemisinin-deficient Artemisia annua herbal preparation exhibits potent anticancer activity against triple negative human breast cancer.

Methods:   Total population of Iran in 2014 was 76,639,000. The INPCR covered 30 out of 31 provinces (98% of total population). It registered only cases diagnosed with malignant new primary tumors. The main sources for data collection included pathology center, hospitals as well as death registries. Quality assessment and analysis of data were performed by CanReg-5 software. Age standardized incidence rates (ASR) (per 100,000) were reported at national and subnational levels.  Results:   Overall, 112,131 new cancer cases were registered in INPCR in 2014, of which 60,469 (53.9%) were male. The diagnosis of cancer was made by microscopic confirmation in 76,568 cases (68.28%). The ASRs of all cancers were 177.44 and 141.18 in male and female, respectively. Cancers of the stomach (ASR = 21.24), prostate (18.41) and colorectum (16.57) were the most common cancers in men and the top three cancers in women were malignancies of breast (34.53), colorectum (11.86) and stomach (9.44). The ASR of cervix uteri cancer in women was 1.78. Our findings suggested high incidence of cancers of the esophagus, stomach and lung in North/ North West of Iran.  Conclusion:   Our results showed that Iran is a medium-risk area for incidence of cancers. We found differences in the most common cancers in Iran comparing to those reported for the World.

Purpose:   To evaluate the efficacy of in vivo 3D 1 H MR spectroscopic imaging (3D 1 H MRSI) with a semi-localized adiabatic selective refocusing (sLASER) sequence and gradient-modulated offset-independent adiabatic (GOIA) pulses for detection of central gland prostate cancer. Additionally four risk models were developed to differentiate 1) normal vs. cancer, 2) low- vs. high-risk cancer, 3) low- vs. intermediate-risk cancer, and 4) intermediate- vs. high-risk cancer voxels.  Study type:   Prospective.  Subjects:   Thirty-six patients with biopsy-proven central gland prostate cancer.  Field strength/sequence:   3T MRI / 3D 1 H MRSI using GOIA-sLASER.  Assessment:   Cancer and normal regions of interest (ROIs) were selected by an experienced radiologist and 1 H MRSI voxels were placed within the ROIs to calculate seven metabolite signal ratios. Voxels were split into two subsets, 80% for model training and 20% for testing.  Statistical tests:   Four support vector machine (SVM) models were built using the training dataset. The accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity for each model were calculated for the testing dataset.  Results:   High-quality MR spectra were obtained for the whole central gland of the prostate. The normal vs. cancer diagnostic model achieved the highest predictive performance with an accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of 96.2%, 95.8%, and 93.1%, respectively. The accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of the low- vs. high-risk cancer and low- vs. intermediate-risk cancer models were 82.5%, 89.2%, 70.2%, and 73.0%, 84.7%, 60.8%, respectively. The intermediate- vs. high-risk cancer model yielded an accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity lower than 55%.  Data conclusion:   The GOIA-sLASER sequence with an external phased-array coil allows for fast assessment of central gland prostate cancer. The classification offers a promising diagnostic tool for discriminating normal vs. cancer, low- vs. high-risk cancer, and low- vs. intermediate-risk cancer.

Patients and methods: Patients with prostate cancer (PCa) who underwent [68Ga]-PSMA-11 PET/CT followed by radical prostatectomy and pelvic lymph node dissection were prospectively enrolled (n=20). Coregistered histopathological gross tumor volume (GTV-Histo) in the prostate served as reference. 133 RF were derived from GTV-Histo and from manually created segmentations of the intraprostatic tumor volume (GTV-Exp). Spearman´s correlation coefficients (ρ) were assessed between RF derived from the different GTVs. We additionally analyzed the differences in RF values for PCa and non-PCa tissues. Furthermore, areas under receiver-operating characteristics curves (AUC) were calculated and uni- and multivariate analyses were performed to evaluate the RF based discrimination of GS 7 and ≥8 disease and of patients with nodal spread (pN1) and non-nodal spread (pN0) in surgical specimen. The results found in the latter analyses were validated by a retrospective cohort of 40 patients. Results: Most RF from GTV-Exp showed strong correlations with RF from GTV-Histo (86% with ρ>0.7). 81% and 76% of RF from GTV-Exp and GTV-Histo significantly discriminated between PCa and non-PCa tissue. The texture feature QSZHGE discriminated between GS 7 and ≥8 considering GTV-Histo (AUC=0.93) and GTV-Exp (prospective cohort: AUC=0.91 / validation cohort: AUC=0.84). QSZHGE also discriminated between pN1 and pN0 disease considering GTV-Histo (AUC=0.85) and GTV-Exp (prospective cohort: AUC=0.87 / validation cohort: AUC=0.85). In uni- and multivariate analyses including patients of both cohorts QSZHGE was a statistically significant (p<0.01) predictor for PCa patients with GS ≥8 tumors and pN1 status. Conclusion: RF derived from PSMA PET discriminated between PCa and non-PCa tissue within the prostate. Additionally, the texture feature QSZHGE discriminated between GS 7 and GS ≥8 tumors and between patients with pN1 and pN0 disease.

Targeting BRD4 by genetic knockdown or chemical inhibitors blocked mitochondrial fission and caused CSC exhaustion and loss of tumorigenic capability. Depletion of CSCs occurred in multiple prostate cancer models, indicating a common vulnerability and dependency on mitochondrial dynamics. These effects depended on rewiring of the BRD4-driven transcription and repression of mitochondrial fission factor (Mff). Knockdown of Mff reproduced the effects of BRD4 inhibition, whereas ectopic Mff expression rescued prostate CSCs from exhaustion.

An Analysis of the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results Database""","""Aims:   To characterise the presenting features of those who ultimately die from prostate cancer (PCa).  Materials and methods:   The study population consisted of patients in the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) Program database diagnosed with PCa between 1990 and 2015. Patients were assigned to the following clinical risk groups: low-risk localised (LRL), intermediate-risk localised (IRL), high-risk localised (HRL), node-positive and metastatic (M1). Before 2004, in the absence of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and Gleason score data, patients with cT1-T2aN0M0 and low-grade PCa were classified as LRL, those with cT3-4N0M0 or high-grade PCa were classified as HRL and all others with N0M0 disease were classified as IRL. The primary aim was to describe the risk group distribution of those who ultimately died from PCa compared with those who were diagnosed with PCa over the study period. A secondary aim was to estimate PCa-specific survival (PCSS) and evaluate the association of risk group with PCSS.  Results:   Among a total of 811 487 patients who were diagnosed with PCa, data sufficient for risk group determination were present in 635 733 patients. The median follow-up was 83 months. The overall risk group distribution at diagnosis was as follows: LRL 10.5%, IRL 49.7%, HRL 34.8%, node-positive 1.5% and M1 3.5%. The risk group distribution of those who died from PCa was 3.9%, 29.4%, 40.9%, 3.2% and 22.8%, respectively. Compared with LRL PCa, the adjusted hazard ratio (95% confidence interval) for PCSS was 1.40 (1.33-1.46) in IRL, 3.76 (3.60-3.93) in HRL, 11.87 (11.14-12.65) in node-positive and 37.12 (35.43-38.88) in M1.  Conclusions:   In this large contemporary cohort, patients with M1, node-positive and HRL disease accounted for two-thirds of all deaths from PCa. De novo metastatic PCa was associated with an approximately 40-fold increased risk of death from PCa compared with LRL PCa. Efforts to improve PCSS will therefore depend largely on improvements in therapy in those with M1, node-positive and HRL disease.""","""['S Roy', 'S C Morgan']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Clin Oncol (R Coll Radiol)""","""['Trends in incidence and 5-year mortality in men with newly diagnosed, metastatic prostate cancer-A population-based analysis of 2 national cohorts.', 'Competing risk of the specific mortality among Asian-American patients with prostate cancer: a surveillance, epidemiology, and end results analysis.', 'More advantages in detecting bone and soft tissue metastases from prostate cancer using 18F-PSMA PET/CT.', 'Outcomes of initially expectantly managed patients with low or intermediate risk screen-detected localized prostate cancer.', 'Increase in the Annual Rate of Newly Diagnosed Metastatic Prostate Cancer: A Contemporary Analysis of the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results Database.', 'Integrating CT-based radiomic model with clinical features improves long-term prognostication in high-risk prostate cancer.', 'A Prospective Study of Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy (SBRT) with Concomitant Whole-Pelvic Radiotherapy (WPRT) for High-Risk Localized Prostate Cancer Patients Using 1.5 Tesla Magnetic Resonance Guidance: The Preliminary Clinical Outcome.', 'Abiraterone acetate and prednisolone with or without enzalutamide for high-risk non-metastatic prostate cancer: a meta-analysis of primary results from two randomised controlled phase 3 trials of the STAMPEDE platform protocol.', 'A Review on the Current Treatment Paradigm in High-Risk Prostate Cancer.', 'Subtotal surgical therapy for localized prostate cancer: a single-center precision prostatectomy experience in 25 patients, and SEER-registry data analysis.']"""

However, the specific functions of miR-107 in prostate cancer and its relevant mechanisms are still unknown. The aim of this research was to investigate the cellular functions of miR-107 in PCa and reveal the relevant mechanisms. MicroRNA tailing quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) was adopted to measure the expression of miR-107 in PCa cell line DU145 and PC3, as well as in normal prostate cell line RWPE-1. The miR-107 expression pattern in PCa tissues and paired peritumoral tissues were determined by Chromogenic In Situ Hybridization (CISH). Cell viability, colony formation, flow cytometry cell cycle and apoptosis, wound healing and Transwell migration assays were performed to study the miR-107 functions in PCa cells. Further, qRT-PCR, western blot analysis and dual-luciferase reporter assays were conducted to verify the target of miR-107 in PCa. Results demonstrated that miR-107 was downregulated in PCa cells and tissues in comparison with normal prostate cells and peritumoral tissues, and the over-expression of miR-107 suppressed proliferation and induced G1/S arrest of PCa cells but had no effects on apoptosis or cell motility of PCa cells. MiR-107 was found to target cyclin E1 (CCNE1) in PCa cells by directly binding to its 3'-UTR. In conclusion, miR-107 could be a potential tumor suppressor in PCa, and the restoration of miR-107 might provide a new therapeutic option for PCa.""","""['X Zhang', 'K Jin', 'J D Luo', 'B Liu', 'L P Xie']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Neoplasma""","""['miR-326 functions as a tumor suppressor in human prostatic carcinoma by targeting Mucin1.', 'MiR-15a is underexpressed and inhibits the cell cycle by targeting CCNE1 in breast cancer.', 'MicroRNA-487a-3p functions as a new tumor suppressor in prostate cancer by targeting CCND1.', 'microRNA-802 inhibits epithelial-mesenchymal transition through targeting flotillin-2 in human prostate cancer.', ""Nonconserved miR-608 suppresses prostate cancer progression through RAC2/PAK4/LIMK1 and BCL2L1/caspase-3 pathways by targeting the 3'-UTRs of RAC2/BCL2L1 and the coding region of PAK4."", 'FBXL16 Promotes Endometrial Progesterone Resistance via PP2AB55α /Cyclin D1 Axis in Ishikawa.', 'Elevated serum CEA is associated with liver metastasis and distinctive circulating tumor DNA alterations in patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Dysregulation of the miRNome unveils a crosstalk between obesity and prostate cancer: miR-107 asa personalized diagnostic and therapeutic tool.', 'Crosstalk between Long Non Coding RNAs, microRNAs and DNA Damage Repair in Prostate Cancer: New Therapeutic Opportunities?', ""CircSLC7A6 promotes the progression of Wilms' tumor via microRNA-107/ ABL proto-oncogene 2 axis.""]"""

Previously, we found that: (1) fragmentation of the Golgi complex correlates with the progression of PCa; (2) ethanol (EtOH) induces Golgi disorganization, which, in turn, alters intra-Golgi localization of some Golgi proteins. Also, progression of the prostate tumor is associated with activation of N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase-V (MGAT5)-mediated N-glycosylation of pro-metastatic proteins, including matriptase and integrins, followed by their enhanced retention at the cell surface. Here, using high-resolution microscopy, we found that alcohol effect on Golgi in low passage androgen-responsive LNCaP cells mimic the fragmented Golgi phenotype of androgen-refractory high passage LNCaP and PC-3 cells. Next, we detected that transition to androgen unresponsiveness is accompanied by downregulation of N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase-III (MGAT3), the enzyme that competes with MGAT5 for anti-metastatic N-glycan branching. Moreover, in low passage LNCaP cells, alcohol-induced Golgi fragmentation induced translocation of MGAT3 from the Golgi to the cytoplasm, while intra-Golgi localization of MGAT5 appeared unaffected. Then, the relationship between Golgi morphology, MGAT3 intracellular position, and clinicopathologic features was assessed in human PCa patient specimens with and without a history of alcohol dependence. We revealed that within the same clinical stage, the level of Golgi disorganization and the cytoplasmic shift of MGAT3 was more prominent in patients consuming alcohol. In vitro studies suggest that EtOH-induced downregulation of MGAT3 correlates with activation of MGAT5-mediated glycosylation and overexpression of both matriptase and integrins. In sum, we provide a novel insight into the alcohol-mediated tumor promotion.""","""['A V Kubyshkin', 'I I Fomochkina', 'A M Petrosyan']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Krim Z Eksp Klin Med""","""['The non-canonical mechanism of ER stress-mediated progression of prostate cancer.', 'Targeting the ATF6-mediated ER stress response and autophagy blocks integrin-driven prostate cancer progression.', 'The Role of Alcohol-Induced Golgi Fragmentation for Androgen Receptor Signaling in Prostate Cancer.', 'Glycans and cancer: role of N-glycans in cancer biomarker, progression and metastasis, and therapeutics.', 'Glycoprotein glycosylation and cancer progression.', 'Construction of long non-coding RNA- and microRNA-mediated competing endogenous RNA networks in alcohol-related esophageal cancer.', 'Alcohol and Prostate Cancer: Time to Draw Conclusions.', 'The non-canonical mechanism of ER stress-mediated progression of prostate cancer.', 'Alcohol-Induced Liver Injury: Down-regulation and Redistribution of Rab3D Results in Atypical Protein Trafficking.', 'Unlocking Golgi: Why Does Morphology Matter?']"""
