Previous studies proposed methods that are site-specific techniques as research tools with limited availability and typically require manual intervention, not completely ready to use in the clinical environment. The purpose of this study was to develop a fully automatic computational method to correct noise bias in ADC quantification and perform a preliminary evaluation in the clinical prostate diffusion weighted imaging (DWI). Using a pseudo replica approach for the noise map calculation as well as a direct mapping and a stepwise Chebychev polynomial modelling approach for the ADC fitting, a fully automatic noise-bias-compensated ADC calculation method was proposed and implemented both on the scanner and offline. The proposed method was validated in a computer simulation and a standardized diffusion phantom with ground-truth values. Two in vivo studies were performed to evaluate the proposed method in the clinical environment. The first in vivo study performed acquisitions using a clinically routine prostate DWI protocol on 29 subjects to evaluate the consistency between simulated and empirical results. In the second in vivo study, prostate ADC values of 14 subjects were compared between data acquired with external coils only and reconstructed with the proposed method vs. acquired with external combined with endorectal coils and reconstructed with the conventional method. In statistical analyses, p < 0.05 was regarded as significantly different. In the computer simulation, the proposed method showed smaller error percentage than the other methods and was significantly different (p < 2.2 × 10-16). With low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), the conventional method underestimated ADC values compared to the ground truth values of the diffusion phantom, while the results of the proposed method were more consistent with the ground truth values. Statistical analyses showed no significant differences between measured and simulated results in the first in vivo study (p = 0.5618). Data from the second in vivo study showed that agreement between ADC measured with external coils only and combined coils was improved for the proposed method (mean bias: 0.04 × 10-3 mm2/s, 95% confidence interval (CI) = [-0.01, 0.09] × 10-3 mm2/s, p = 0.187), compared to the conventional method (mean bias: -0.12 × 10-3 mm2/s, 95% CI = [-0.17, -0.06] × 10-3 mm2/s, p < 0.0001). The proposed method compensates noise bias in low-SNR diffusion-weighted acquisitions and results show improved ADC quantification accuracy in the prostate. This method may be suitable for both clinical imaging and research utilizing ADC quantification.""","""['Xiaodong Zhong', 'Brian M Dale', 'Marcel D Nickel', 'Stephan A R Kannengiesser', 'Berthold Kiefer', 'Mustafa Bashir']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""J Magn Reson""","""['Noise-Compensated, Bias-Corrected Diffusion Weighted Endorectal Magnetic Resonance Imaging via a Stochastically Fully-Connected Joint Conditional Random Field Model.', 'Small Field-of-view single-shot EPI-DWI of the prostate: Evaluation of spatially-tailored two-dimensional radiofrequency excitation pulses.', 'Diffusion-weighted MRI of the prostate at 3.0 T: comparison of endorectal coil (ERC) MRI and phased-array coil (PAC) MRI-The impact of SNR on ADC measurement.', 'Apparent diffusion coefficient-dependent voxelwise computed diffusion-weighted imaging: An approach for improving SNR and reducing T2 shine-through effects.', 'Diffusion and quantification of diffusion of prostate cancer.']"""

However, metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC), a letal form of prostate cancer, is still incurable. Here we tested two naphthalenediimide derivatives, previously reported as multitarget agents, on a couple of relevant mCRPC cell models (DU145 and PC-3). We showed that these compounds interfere with the RAS/MEK/ERK and PI3K/AKT pathways. Interestingly, both these two biological processes depend upon Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) activation. By means of biological and analytical tools we showed that our compounds are efficient inducers of the structural transition of the EGFR promoter towards a G-quadruplex conformation, ultimately leading to a reduction of the receptor production. The overall result is an interesting cytotoxic profile for these two derivatives. Thanks to their activity at different steps, these compounds can open the way to novel therapeutic approaches for mCRPC that could contribute to escape resistance to selective treatments.""","""['Marta Recagni', 'Maria Laura Greco', 'Andrea Milelli', 'Anna Minarini', 'Nadia Zaffaroni', 'Marco Folini', 'Claudia Sissi']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Eur J Med Chem""","""['Disentangling the Structure-Activity Relationships of Naphthalene Diimides as Anticancer G-Quadruplex-Targeting Drugs.', 'Design, synthesis, biophysical and biological studies of trisubstituted naphthalimides as G-quadruplex ligands.', 'Statin derivatives as therapeutic agents for castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Interaction of G-quadruplexes with nonintercalating duplex-DNA minor groove binding ligands.', 'A Novel Use of Olaparib for the Treatment of Metastatic Castration-Recurrent Prostate Cancer.', 'Synthesis and biological evaluation of 3-nitro-4-chromanone derivatives as potential antiproliferative agents for castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Structured Waters Mediate Small Molecule Binding to G-Quadruplex Nucleic Acids.', 'On the Road to Fight Cancer: The Potential of G-quadruplex Ligands as Novel Therapeutic Agents.', 'Synthesis and Spectroscopic Investigation of a Hexaaza Lanthanum(III) Macrocycle with a Hybrid-Type G4 DNA Stabilizing Effect.', 'Synthesis, telomerase inhibitory and anticancer activity of new 2-phenyl-4H-chromone derivatives containing 1,3,4-oxadiazole moiety.']"""

Objective:   To characterize the age disparities among trial enrollees on randomized clinical trials (RCTs) of common cancers in clinical oncology and identify factors associated with wider age imbalances.  Data sources:   Phase 3 clinical oncology RCTs were identified through ClinicalTrials.gov.  Study selection:   Multiarm RCTs assessing a therapeutic intervention for patients with breast, prostate, colorectal, or lung cancer (the 4 most common cancer disease sites) were included.  Data extraction and synthesis:   Trial data were extracted from ClinicalTrials.gov. Trial screening and parameter identification were independently performed by 2 individuals. Data were analyzed in 2018.  Main outcomes and measures:   The difference in median age (DMA) between the trial participant median age and the population-based disease-site-specific median age was determined for each trial.  Results:   Three hundred two trials met inclusion criteria. The trials collectively enrolled 262 354 participants; 249 trials (82.5%) were industry-funded. For all trials, the trial median age of trial participants was a mean of 6.49 years younger than the population median age (95% CI, -7.17 to -5.81 years; P < .001). Age disparities were heightened among industry-funded trials compared with non-industry-funded trials (mean DMA, -6.84 vs -4.72 years; P = .002). Enrollment criteria restrictions based on performance status or age cutoffs were associated with age disparities; however, industry-funded trials were not more likely to use these enrollment restrictions than non-industry-funded trials. Age disparities were also larger among trials that evaluated a targeted systemic therapy and among lung cancer trials. Linear regression modeling revealed a widening gap between trial and population median ages over time at a rate of -0.19 years annually (95% CI, -0.37 to -0.01 years; P = .04).  Conclusions and relevance:   Age disparities between trial participants and the incident disease population are pervasive across trials and appear to be increasing over time. Industry sponsorship of trials is associated with heightened age imbalances among trial participants. With an increasing role of industry funding among cancer trials, efforts to understand and address age disparities are necessary to ensure generalizability of trial results as well as equity in trial access.""","""['Ethan B Ludmir', 'Walker Mainwaring', 'Timothy A Lin', 'Austin B Miller', 'Amit Jethanandani', 'Andres F Espinoza', 'Jacob J Mandel', 'Steven H Lin', 'Benjamin D Smith', 'Grace L Smith', 'Noam A VanderWalde', 'Bruce D Minsky', 'Albert C Koong', 'Thomas E Stinchcombe', 'Reshma Jagsi', 'Daniel R Gomez', 'Charles R Thomas Jr', 'C David Fuller']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""JAMA Oncol""","""['Association of Industry and Academic Sponsorship With Negative Phase 3 Oncology Trials and Reported Outcomes on Participant Survival: A Pooled Analysis.', 'Differences in Funding Sources of Phase III Oncology Clinical Trials by Treatment Modality and Cancer Type.', 'Decreasing incidence of upper age restriction enrollment criteria among cancer clinical trials.', 'The project data sphere initiative: accelerating cancer research by sharing data.', 'Screening for Cervical Cancer With High-Risk Human Papillomavirus Testing: A Systematic Evidence Review for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force Internet.', ""The PRO-RCC study: a long-term PROspective Renal Cell Carcinoma cohort in the Netherlands, providing an infrastructure for 'Trial within Cohorts' study designs."", 'Editorial: Head and neck cancer in the elderly.', 'Temporal changes in characteristics and external validity of randomized controlled trials in older people from 2012 to 2019.', 'Geriatric Radiation Oncology: What We Know and What Can We Do Better?', 'Real-world Outcomes Associated With Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerase Inhibitor Monotherapy Maintenance in Patients With Primary Advanced Ovarian Cancer.']"""

Methods and findings:   The aim was to validate a previously developed unique MRI acquisition and reporting protocol, IMPROD biparametric MRI (bpMRI) (NCT01864135), in men with a clinical suspicion of PCa in a multi-institutional trial (NCT02241122). IMPROD bpMRI has average acquisition time of 15 minutes (no endorectal coil, no intravenous contrast use) and consists of T2-weighted imaging and 3 separate diffusion-weighed imaging acquisitions. Between February 1, 2015, and March 31, 2017, 364 men with a clinical suspicion of PCa were enrolled at 4 institutions in Finland. Men with an equivocal to high suspicion (IMPROD bpMRI Likert score 3-5) of PCa had 2 TBs of up to 2 lesions followed by a systematic biopsy (SB). Men with a low to very low suspicion (IMPROD bpMRI Likert score 1-2) had only SB. All data and protocols are freely available. The primary outcome of the trial was diagnostic accuracy-including overall accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value (NPV), and positive predictive value-of IMPROD bpMRI for clinically significant PCa (SPCa), which was defined as a Gleason score ≥ 3 + 4 (Gleason grade group 2 or higher). In total, 338 (338/364, 93%) prospectively enrolled men completed the trial. The accuracy and NPV of IMPROD bpMRI for SPCa were 70% (113/161) and 95% (71/75) (95% CI 87%-98%), respectively. Restricting the biopsy to men with equivocal to highly suspicious IMPROD bpMRI findings would have resulted in a 22% (75/338) reduction in the number of men undergoing biopsy while missing 4 (3%, 4/146) men with SPCa. The main limitation is uncertainty about the true PCa prevalence in the study cohort, since some of the men may have PCa despite having negative biopsy findings.  Conclusions:   IMPROD bpMRI demonstrated a high NPV for SPCa in men with a clinical suspicion of PCa in this prospective multi-institutional clinical trial.

A well-established radiation dosing schedule (38Gy in 4 fractions) has shown excellent long-term efficacy in high-dose-rate (HDR) brachytherapy.  Objective:   To report 5-yr efficacy, toxicity, and quality-of-life (QOL) outcomes of a novel 4-d SBRT regimen.  Design, setting, and participants:   This was a single-arm prospective phase 2 trial involving 259 patients with low- or intermediate-risk PC treated at 18 US centers from December 2007 to February 2012. The median follow-up was 5yr (interquartile range 37-85mo).  Intervention:   SBRT with 38Gy in four fractions; radiation plans mimicked HDR brachytherapy dosimetry.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   We measured freedom from biochemical recurrence (BCR) and assessed toxicities using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v3.0 and QOL using the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite.  Results and limitations:   The 5-yr BCR-free rates were 100% and 88.5% for patients with low- and intermediate-risk PC, respectively. The cumulative 5-yr grade 2, 3, and 4 toxicity rates were 12.4%, 1.9%, and 0.4% for urinary, and 3.4%, 0%, and 0% for gastrointestinal toxicities, respectively. The median baseline prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level of 5.12ng/ml decreased to 0.1ng/ml by ≥42mo. QOL scores decreased at 1mo but returned to baseline by 6mo, with a later decline (≥24mo) in the urinary continence domain (pad use was 2% at baseline and 10% at 5yr), and lower sexual potency over time. Comparative outcomes versus other types of radiotherapy are difficult because the trial was not randomized.  Conclusions:   This regimen yields a high rate of BCR-free survival, with a very low median PSA nadir suggesting prostate ablation. For properly selected patients with low- or intermediate-risk PC who choose SBRT, this treatment regimen is effective.  Patient summary:   This potent four-treatment stereotactic body radiotherapy regimen appears to be effective for patients with early prostate cancer.""","""['Donald B Fuller', 'Aaron D Falchook', 'Tami Crabtree', 'Brent L Kane', 'Clinton A Medbery', 'Kelly Underhill', 'James R Gray', 'Anuj Peddada', 'Ronald C Chen']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Eur Urol Oncol""","""['Early Tolerance and Tumor Control Outcomes with High-dose Ultrahypofractionated Radiation Therapy for Prostate Cancer.', 'Salvage prostate re-irradiation using high-dose-rate brachytherapy or focal stereotactic body radiotherapy for local recurrence after definitive radiation therapy.', 'Outcomes of a Dose-Escalated Stereotactic Body Radiation Phase 1 Trial for Patients With Low- and Intermediate-Risk Prostate Cancer.', 'Comparison of outcomes and toxicities among radiation therapy treatment options for prostate cancer.', 'Salvage reirradiation for local prostate cancer recurrence after radiation therapy.

Objective:   To assess whether stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) provides a potential for cure in a selected group of patients with oligometastatic PCa in the PSMA-PET era.  Design, setting, and participants:   This was a prospective, single-centre study of patients with oligometastatic PCa undergoing SBRT from November 2014 to July 2016. We included patients with relapsed PCa receiving SBRT with PSMA-PET-confirmed oligometastases (n=1-3) confined to lymph nodes (LNs) or bone without androgen deprivation therapy. SBRT schedules included 20Gy/1# or 24Gy/2# to bone metastases, and 50Gy/5# or 30Gy/3# to LNs.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   The primary endpoint was biochemical failure (BF) defined as a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level of nadir + 0.2 ng/ml following SBRT.  Results and limitations:   Fifty-seven patients were eligible, of whom 50 (88%) had undergone radical prostatectomy. The median time from definitive treatment to SBRT was 5.6 yr. A total of 73 lesions were treated: 44 patients had one metastasis, while 13 had two or three. Thirty-seven patients (65%) had LN-only disease, while 18 (31%) had bone-only metastasis. Median follow up was 16 mo. The median biochemical disease-free survival (bDFS) for the cohort was 11 mo, with 31.9% bDFS at 15 mo. All patients with BF (n=43) underwent a repeat PSMA-PET scan, which revealed no in-field failures. Median bDFS was not affected by prostate-specific antigen (PSA) at diagnosis, Gleason score, time from diagnosis to SBRT, site (bone vs LN), PSA doubling time before SBRT, or number of metastases. Failures were somewhat less common in patients with low PSA before SBRT. Toxicity was rare: no patients developed grade ≥2 late toxicity.  Conclusions:   SBRT delivered very high rates of local control with minimal toxicity. However, distant recurrences occurred in most patients by 15 mo and did not appear to be predicted by known prognostic factors.  Patient summary:   In this report, we looked at outcomes after the use of stereotactic body radiotherapy for patients with prostate cancer spread to one to three lymph nodes or bones as detected by positron emission tomography scans. We demonstrated high rates of control of the treated lesions with low toxicity, but by 15 mo more than two-thirds of patients had developed recurrent cancer outside the treated area.""","""['Andrew Kneebone', 'George Hruby', 'Hannah Ainsworth', 'Keelan Byrne', 'Chris Brown', 'Linxin Guo', 'Alexander Guminski', 'Thomas Eade']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Eur Urol Oncol""","""['Stereotactic Radiotherapy for Lesions Detected via 68Ga-Prostate-specific Membrane Antigen and 18F-Fluorodexyglucose Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography in Patients with Nonmetastatic Prostate Cancer with Early Prostate-specific Antigen Progression on Androgen Deprivation Therapy: A Prospective Single-center Study.', 'Single-fraction prostate-specific membrane antigen positron emission tomography- and multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging-guided stereotactic body radiotherapy for prostate cancer local recurrences.', 'Prostate-specific membrane antigen-positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PSMA-PET/CT)-guided stereotactic ablative body radiotherapy for oligometastatic prostate cancer: a single-institution experience and review of the published literature.', '68Ga-PSMA-PET/CT-directed IGRT/SBRT for oligometastases of recurrent prostate cancer after initial surgery.', 'Management of positive lymph nodes following radical prostatectomy.', 'Long-term outcomes of SBRT for PSMA PET detected oligometastatic prostate cancer.', 'The diagnosis and treatment of castrate-sensitive oligometastatic prostate cancer: A review.', 'Management of Patients with Recurrent and Metachronous Oligometastatic Prostate Cancer in the Era of PSMA PET.', 'Oligometastatic Prostate Cancer: Current Status and Future Challenges.', ""A critical review on oligometastatic disease: a radiation oncologist's perspective.""]"""

Current evidence is limited owing to relatively small cohorts from select, tertiary referral centers.  Objective:   To evaluate the incidence of and potential risk factors for RI during radical RP at a population level in the USA.  Design, settings, and participants:   Using the National Inpatient Sample database (2003-2012), we identified patients with prostate cancer who underwent RP. Survey-weighted cohorts were created based on the diagnosis and repair of RI during initial hospitalization. Data included demographics, hospital characteristics, surgical details, complications, and perioperative outcomes. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify risk factors for RI.  Results and limitations:   Of 614 294 men who underwent RP, there were 2900 (0.5%) RIs, with a 26% decline from 2003-2006 to 2009-2012 (p<0.01). Patients with RI were slightly older (62.0 vs 61.2 yr; p<0.01) and more commonly of African ancestry (0.8% vs 0.4% Caucasians; p<0.01). RI was more common among patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), metastatic disease, and low body mass index (BMI; p<0.05). The RI incidence was higher for open (0.6%) compared to laparoscopic (0.4%) and robotic RP (0.2%; p<0.01). RI was more common at rural (0.8% vs 0.5% urban), nonteaching (0.6% vs 0.4% teaching), and low-volume hospitals (0.6% vs 0.3% high-volume; p<0.01). Complication rates (28% vs 11%; p<0.01) and length of stay (4.8 vs 2.3 d; p<0.01) were greater in the RI group. Multivariable analysis identified African ancestry, BPH, and metastatic cancer as predictors of RI, while robotic approach, high-volume hospital, and obesity reduced the risk (p<0.05).  Conclusions:   RI during RP is a rare complication, but is more common among men with African ancestry and for procedures carried out using an open surgical technique or in low-volume hospitals, and among those with low BMI, BPH, or metastatic disease.

Design, setting, and participants:   A Markov cohort model for men with low-risk prostate cancer was developed to assess the three strategies. Input data were derived from meta-analysis, other published literature, and national cost reports. A health care perspective was used for a European setting.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Health care costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were modeled over a lifetime horizon. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to address uncertainty in model parameters.  Results and limitations:   In the base case analysis, expected mean costs per man screened were €5150 for TRUSGB, €5994 for mpMRI without biopsy, and €4848 for mpMRI with biopsy. Corresponding QALYs were higher for mpMRI with biopsy compared to TRUSGB (18.67 vs 18.66) and lower for mpMRI without biopsy compared to TRUSGB (18.27 vs 18.66). Owing to lower costs and higher effects, the mpMRI with biopsy strategy was cost-effective compared to the TRUSGB strategy.  Conclusions:   mpMRI with MR-TRUSGB appears to be the most cost-effective AS strategy for men with low-risk prostate cancer.  Patient summary:   We compared costs and quality of life for the standard active surveillance (AS) program for men diagnosed with low-risk prostate cancer to a monitoring program comprising multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) with and without biopsies. Our results suggest that an AS strategy using mpMRI with biopsy improves quality of life and costs decrease. An AS strategy using mpMRI without biopsy was not beneficial compared to the standard program.""","""['Sejal Patel', 'Jan J Rongen', 'Jurgen J Fütterer', 'Artem Boltyenkov', 'Maroeska M Rovers']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Eur Urol Oncol""","""['Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging Cost-effectiveness in Active Surveillance: More a Belief than Evidence.', 'Cost-effectiveness of magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and MR-guided targeted biopsy versus systematic transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsy in diagnosing prostate cancer: a modelling study from a health care perspective.', 'Head-to-head Comparison of Transrectal Ultrasound-guided Prostate Biopsy Versus Multiparametric Prostate Resonance Imaging with Subsequent Magnetic Resonance-guided Biopsy in Biopsy-naïve Men with Elevated Prostate-specific Antigen: A Large Prospective Multicenter Clinical Study.', 'Optimising the Diagnosis of Prostate Cancer in the Era of Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging: A Cost-effectiveness Analysis Based on the Prostate MR Imaging Study (PROMIS).', 'The diagnostic accuracy and cost-effectiveness of magnetic resonance spectroscopy and enhanced magnetic resonance imaging techniques in aiding the localisation of prostate abnormalities for biopsy: a systematic review and economic evaluation.', 'Prostate Indeterminate Lesions on Magnetic Resonance Imaging-Biopsy Versus Surveillance: A Literature Review.', 'The Economic Burden of Localized Prostate Cancer and Insights Derived from Cost-Effectiveness Studies of the Different Treatments.', 'Cost-Effectiveness Analysis and Microsimulation of Serial Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging in Active Surveillance of Localized Prostate Cancer.', 'Role of MRI-Based Functional Imaging in Improving the Therapeutic Index of Radiotherapy in Cancer Treatment.', 'The role of magnetic resonance imaging in active surveillance of prostate cancer.', 'Active Surveillance Strategies for Low-Grade Prostate Cancer: Comparative Benefits and Cost-effectiveness.']"""

Objective:   To evaluate outcomes among mCRPC patients treated with docetaxel (DOC), cabazitaxel (CABA), and a novel androgen receptor-targeted agent (ART; abiraterone acetate or enzalutamide) according to three different sequences.  Design, setting, and participants:   Data from 669 consecutive mCRPC patients were retrospectively collected between November 2012 and October 2016.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   The primary endpoint was the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response (decrease ≥50% from baseline) to each therapy. Secondary endpoints included best clinical benefit, time to PSA progression, radiological progression-free survival (rPFS), overall survival (OS), and toxicity.  Results and limitations:   A total of 158 patients received DOC→CABA→ART (group 1), 456 received DOC→ART→CABA (group 2), and 55 received ART→DOC→CABA (group 3). At baseline, PSA progression only and Gleason <8 were more common in group 3. PSA response on DOC was lower in group 3 than in other groups (p=0.02) and PSA response on CABA was higher in the second than in the third line (p=0.001). In Group 3, rPFS on ART (6.6 mo) and DOC (9.2 mo) was also shorter than in the other groups. OS calculated from the first life-extending therapy reached 34.8, 35.8, and 28.9 mo in groups 1, 2 and 3, respectively (p=0.007). Toxicity was comparable between the arms. The main limitations of the trial are its retrospective design and the low number of patients in group 3.  Conclusions:   In this retrospective trial, sequencing of DOC, CABA, and one ART, was associated with median OS of up to 35.8 mo. CABA seemed to retain its activity regardless of treatment sequence. DOC activity after ART appeared to be reduced, but the data are insufficient to conclude that cross-resistance occurs.

To date there has been no formal assessment of whether funding docetaxel in this setting represents an appropriate use of UK National Health Service (NHS) resources.  Objective:   To assess whether administering docetaxel to men with PC starting long-term hormone therapy is cost-effective in a UK setting.  Design, setting, and participants:   We modelled health outcomes and costs in the UK NHS using data collected within the STAMPEDE trial, which enrolled men with high-risk, locally advanced metastatic or recurrent PC starting first-line hormone therapy.  Intervention:   SOC was hormone therapy for ≥2 yr and radiotherapy in some patients. Docetaxel (75mg/m2) was administered alongside SOC for six three-weekly cycles.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   The model generated lifetime predictions of costs, changes in survival duration, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs).  Results and limitations:   The model predicted that docetaxel would extend survival (discounted quality-adjusted survival) by 0.89 yr (0.51) for metastatic PC and 0.78 yr (0.39) for nonmetastatic PC, and would be cost-effective in metastatic PC (ICER £5514/QALY vs SOC) and nonmetastatic PC (higher QALYs, lower costs vs SOC). Docetaxel remained cost-effective in nonmetastatic PC when the assumption of no survival advantage was modelled.  Conclusions:   Docetaxel is cost-effective among patients with nonmetastatic and metastatic PC in a UK setting. Clinicians should consider whether the evidence is now sufficiently compelling to support docetaxel use in patients with nonmetastatic PC, as the opportunity to offer docetaxel at hormone therapy initiation will be missed for some patients by the time more mature survival data are available.

Objective:   To report on the use of four-point peritoneal flap fixation (4PPFF) during RP to reduce lymphocele occurrence following PLND.  Design, setting, and participants:   Between April 2010 and May 2017, 1358 patients underwent RP with concomitant bilateral ePLND. From this cohort, 193 patients who had undergone PNLD with 4PPFF were matched in a 1:1 ratio with respect to age, body mass index, initial PSA, and number of lymph nodes removed to patients who had undergone PLND without 4PPFF.  Intervention:   4PPFF was performed by suturing the cut end of the ventral parietal peritoneum at four points (to the anterior and lateral pelvic side wall on both sides) following PLND so that the peritoneal surface was exposed to the iliac vessels and obturator fossa.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   All patients underwent ultrasound on postoperative days 6, 28, and 90 to test for the presence of lymphocele. For univariate analysis, a χ2 test and analysis of variance were applied, as appropriate. Statistical significance was set at p<0.05, and all p values reported were two-sided.  Results and limitations:   There were no significant differences between the two groups with respect to intraoperative blood loss, positive surgical margin rate, Gleason score, clinical stage, and number of positive cores. Asymptomatic lymphocele was observed in four patients (2.07%) in the 4PPFF group compared to 16 patients (8.3%) without 4PPFF (p=0.0058). Similarly, a significant difference in the incidence of symptomatic lymphocele was observed: two patients (1.03%) in the 4PPFF group versus nine patients (4.6%) without 4PPFF (p=0.0322). There were no differences in other complication rates between the two groups. The limitations of the study are its retrospective and nonrandomised nature, with postoperative follow-up based on ultrasound imaging rather than computed tomography because of ethical considerations, which could have caused observer bias.  Conclusions:   4PPFF is a safe and effective procedure in preventing lymphocele occurrence in patients undergoing RP with PLND. The increase in exposure of the PLND raw area to the peritoneal surface following this procedure may aid in increased absorption of accumulating lymph fluid. Further prospective randomised multicentre studies are warranted to confirm our observations.  Patient summary:   We report on the use of a surgical technique to decrease the collection of lymphatic fluid in the abdominal cavity following lymph node removal during radical removal of the prostate gland in patients with prostate cancer. Patients undergoing this procedure had significantly better outcomes when compared to patients operated on in the conventional approach.""","""['Jens-Uwe Stolzenburg', 'Vinodh K A Arthanareeswaran', 'Anja Dietel', 'Toni Franz', 'Evangelos Liatsikos', 'Iason Kyriazis', 'Roman Ganzer', 'Krassimir Yaney', 'Hoang Minh Do']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Eur Urol Oncol""","""['Effect of Peritoneal Fixation (PerFix) on Lymphocele Formation in Robot-assisted Radical Prostatectomy with Pelvic Lymphadenectomy: Results of a Randomized Prospective Trial.', 'Reduction in incidence of lymphocele following extraperitoneal radical prostatectomy and pelvic lymph node dissection by bilateral peritoneal fenestration.', 'Novel Technique Prevents Lymphoceles After Transperitoneal Robotic-assisted Pelvic Lymph Node Dissection: Peritoneal Flap Interposition.', 'Pelvic lymph node dissection during robot-assisted radical prostatectomy: efficacy, limitations, and complications-a systematic review of the literature.', 'Impact of Pelvic Lymph Node Dissection and Its Extent on Perioperative Morbidity in Patients Undergoing Radical Prostatectomy for Prostate Cancer: A Comprehensive Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.', 'High BMI and Surgical Time Are Significant Predictors of Lymphocele after Robot-Assisted Radical Prostatectomy.', 'Different lymph node dissection ranges during radical prostatectomy for patients with prostate cancer: a systematic review and network meta-analysis.', 'Risk factors for lymphorrhea and lymphocele after radical prostatectomy: a retrospective case-control study.', 'A Peritoneal Purse-String Suture Prevents Symptomatic Lymphoceles in Retzius-Sparing Robot-Assisted Radical Prostatectomy.', 'Bilateral Peritoneal Flaps Reduce Incidence and Complications of Lymphoceles after Robotic Radical Prostatectomy with Pelvic Lymph Node Dissection-Results of the Prospective Randomized Multicenter Trial ProLy.']"""

Objective:   To characterize the incremental value of additional MRI-ultrasound (US) fusion targeted biopsy cores in defining the optimal number when planning biopsy and to predict men who might benefit from more than two targeted cores.  Design, setting, and participants:   This was a retrospective cohort study of MRI-US fusion targeted biopsies between 2015 and 2017.  Intervention:   MRI-US fusion targeted biopsy in which four biopsy cores were directed to each MRI-targeted ROI.  Outcomes measurements and statistical analysis:   The MRI-targeted cores representing the first highest Gleason core (FHGC) and first clinically significant cancer core (FCSC; GS≥3+4) were evaluated. We analyzed the frequency of FHGC and FCSC among cores 1-4 and created a logistic regression model to predict FHGC >2. The number of unnecessary cores avoided and the number of malignancies missed for each Gleason grade were calculated via clinical utility analysis. The level of agreement between biopsy and prostatectomy Gleason scores was evaluated using Cohen's κ.  Results and limitations:   A total of 479 patients underwent fusion targeted biopsy with four individual cores, with 615 ROIs biopsied. Among those, FHGC was core 1 in 477 (76.8%), core 2 in 69 (11.6%), core 3 in 48 (7.6%), and core 4 in 24 men (4.0%) with any cancer. Among men with clinically significant cancer, FCSC was core 1 in 191 (77.8%), core 2 in 26 (11.1%), core 3 in 17 (6.2%), and core 4 in 11 samples (4.9%). In comparison to men with a Prostate Imaging-Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) score of 5, patients were significantly less likely to have FHGS >2 if they had PI-RADS 4 (odds ratio [OR] 0.287; p=0.006), PI-RADS 3 (OR 0.284; p=0.006), or PI-RADS 2 (OR 0.343; p=0.015). Study limitations include a single-institution experience and the retrospective nature.  Conclusions:   Cores 1-2 represented FHGC 88.4% and FCSC 88.9% of the time. A PI-RADS score of 5 independently predicted FHGC >2. Although the majority of cancers in our study were appropriately characterized in the first two biopsy cores, there remains a proportion of men who would benefit from additional cores.

Objective:   To validate models predicting LNI in Dutch PCa patients.  Design, setting, and participants:   Sixteen prediction models were validated using a patient cohort of 1001 men who underwent ePLND. Patient characteristics included serum prostate specific antigen (PSA), cT stage, primary and secondary Gleason scores, number of biopsy cores taken, and number of positive biopsy cores.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Model performance was assessed using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Calibration plots were used to visualize over- or underestimation by the models.  Results and limitations:   LNI was identified in 276 patients (28%). Patients with LNI had higher PSA, higher primary Gleason pattern, higher Gleason score, higher number of nodes harvested, higher number of positive biopsy cores, and higher cT stage compared to patients without LNI. Predictions generated by the 2012 Briganti nomogram (AUC 0.76) and the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) web calculator (AUC 0.75) were the most accurate. Calibration had a decisive role in selecting the most accurate models because of overlapping confidence intervals for the AUCs. Underestimation of LNI probability in patients had a predicted probability of <20%. The omission of model updating was a limitation of the study.  Conclusions:   Models predicting LNI in PCa patients were externally validated in a Dutch patient cohort.

Objective:   to evaluate the effects of initial Gleason grade 3+3 or 3+4 on clinical outcomes during AS.  Design, setting, and participants:   We retrospectively reviewed outcomes for men on AS between 1990 and 2016 with Gleason 3+3 or 3+4 who had two or more biopsies.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   We evaluated associations of diagnostic grade with reclassification (upgrade ≥ 3+4), treatment, metastasis, adverse surgical pathology, and biochemical recurrence (BCR) after deferred radical prostatectomy (RP), with a sensitivity analysis for the amount of pattern 4 disease.  Results and limitations:   Of 1243 men, 1119 (90%) had Gleason 3+3 and 124 (10%) 3+4 on initial biopsy. The 5-yr unadjusted reclassification-free survival was 49% regardless of grade, while patients with Gleason 3+4 had lower treatment-free survival (49% vs 64%; p<0.01). On multivariate Cox analysis, grade was associated with lower risk of reclassification (hazard ratio [HR] 0.66, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.46-0.95) and higher risk of treatment (HR 1.37, 95% CI 1.01-1.85). After RP, patients starting with Gleason 3+4 had lower unadjusted 2-yr BCR-free survival (69% vs 93%; p=0.01) and a higher risk of recurrence (HR 3.67, 95% CI 1.30-10.36). Grade was not associated with metastasis (<1% at 5 yr) or adverse pathology. In sensitivity analyses, a single high-grade core was associated with lower risk of reclassification and multiple high-grade cores were associated with a higher risk of treatment. The number of high-grade cores was not independently associated with BCR. Limitations include selection bias, a limited number of intermediate-risk patients, and length of follow-up.

Objective:   To test first postoperative uPSA for prediction of outcome in patients with adverse pathology after RP.  Design, setting, and participants:   Patients with extraprostatic extension and/or a positive margin who did not receive immediate adjuvant therapy.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   First uPSA was measured at 3 mo after RP. The study endpoints were biochemical relapse (BCR), defined as PSA ≥0.2ng/ml, bone metastasis-free survival (BMFS), prostate cancer-specific survival (PCSS), overall survival (OS), and salvage radiation therapy (SRT) success. Outcome results were compared using the Kaplan-Meier method and multivariate analysis (MVA).  Results and limitations:   The cohort consisted of 269 RP patients from 1991-2015 with median follow-up of 77 mo. Sensitivity analysis identified first postoperative uPSA of ≥0.03ng/ml as the optimal threshold for predicting BCR. First postoperative uPSA ≥0.03 versus <0.03ng/ml was associated with worse 5-yr BCR (86%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 71-93% vs 39%, 95% CI 25-51%; p<0.00001), 10-yr BMFS (75%, 95% CI 62-92% vs 95%, 95% CI 88-100%; p=0.0001), 10-yr PCSS (84%, 95% CI 73-96% vs 100%, 95% CI 100-100%; p=0.005), and 10-yr OS (81%, 95% CI 70-93% vs 98%, 95% CI 94-100%; p=0.009). On MVA, first postoperative uPSA ≥0.03ng/ml was an independent predictor of BCR (hazard ratio [HR] 9.4, 95% CI 5.8-15.4; p<0.00001) and the only predictor for BMFS (HR 9.7, 95% CI 2.1-44.6; p=0.0034), PCSS (HR 13.5, 95% CI 1.7-107.9; p=0.014), and OS (HR 5.0, 95% CI 1.4-18.3; p=0.014). Following SRT, first postoperative uPSA ≥0.03ng/ml independently predicted worse BMFS (HR 5.9, 95% CI 1.3-26.9; p=0.021), PCSS (HR 6.9, 95% CI 0.9-55.8; p=0.07), and OS (4.5, 95% CI 1.0-20.1; p=0.057). Limitations include the retrospective design and potential selection bias.  Conclusions:   First postoperative uPSA ≥0.03ng/ml independently predicts BCR, BMFS, PCSS, and OS better than traditional risk factors. SRT alone may be insufficient for patients with high-risk disease when first postoperative uPSA is ≥0.03ng/ml.  Patient summary:   When the first postprostatectomy ultrasensitive prostate-specific antigen level is ≥0.03ng/ml, patients are at higher risk of recurrent and occult prostate cancer.

In 2015, we reported on 12-mo follow-up from the LAPPRO trial showing a moderate advantage of RALP regarding erectile dysfunction. No significant differences were seen for urinary incontinence or surgical margin status.  Objective:   To present patient-reported functional outcomes and recurrent and residual disease at 24-mo follow-up from the prospective multicenter LAPPRO trial.  Design, setting, and participants:   A total of 4003 patients with clinically localized prostate cancer were recruited from 14 Swedish centers, seven performing RALP and seven RRP.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Data were only analyzed for patients operated on by surgeons with >100 prior RPs. Adjusted odds ratios (AORs) were calculated using logistic regression, with adjustment for differences in patient mix.  Results and limitations:   At 24 mo, there was a significant difference in erectile dysfunction in favor of RALP (68% vs 74%; AOR 0.72, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.57-0.91; p=0.006). No significant difference was observed for incontinence (19% vs 16%; AOR 1.29, 95% CI 1.00-1.67; p=0.053) or recurrent or residual disease (13% vs 13%; AOR 0.79, 95% CI 0.59-1.07; p=0.13). We did not adjust for individual surgeon volume and experience, which is a potential limitation.  Conclusions:   Extended follow-up corroborated our previous report at 12 mo of a persistent RALP benefit regarding potency.  Patient summary:   LAPPRO is a Swedish trial comparing two different prostate cancer surgical techniques (robotic compared to open).

It is not known whether adding enzalutamide to testosterone suppression, with or without early docetaxel, will improve survival in men with metastatic, hormone-sensitive prostate cancer.  Methods:   In this open-label, randomized, phase 3 trial, we assigned patients to receive testosterone suppression plus either open-label enzalutamide or a standard nonsteroidal antiandrogen therapy (standard-care group). The primary end point was overall survival. Secondary end points included progression-free survival as determined by the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level, clinical progression-free survival, and adverse events.  Results:   A total of 1125 men underwent randomization; the median follow-up was 34 months. There were 102 deaths in the enzalutamide group and 143 deaths in the standard-care group (hazard ratio, 0.67; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.52 to 0.86; P = 0.002). Kaplan-Meier estimates of overall survival at 3 years were 80% (based on 94 events) in the enzalutamide group and 72% (based on 130 events) in the standard-care group. Better results with enzalutamide were also seen in PSA progression-free survival (174 and 333 events, respectively; hazard ratio, 0.39; P<0.001) and in clinical progression-free survival (167 and 320 events, respectively; hazard ratio, 0.40; P<0.001). Treatment discontinuation due to adverse events was more frequent in the enzalutamide group than in the standard-care group (33 events and 14 events, respectively). Fatigue was more common in the enzalutamide group; seizures occurred in 7 patients in the enzalutamide group (1%) and in no patients in the standard-care group.  Conclusions:   Enzalutamide was associated with significantly longer progression-free and overall survival than standard care in men with metastatic, hormone-sensitive prostate cancer receiving testosterone suppression. The enzalutamide group had a higher incidence of seizures and other toxic effects, especially among those treated with early docetaxel.

Understanding the expression patterns of L1 loci at the individual level will lend to the understanding of the biology of this mutagenic element. This autonomous element makes up a significant portion of the human genome with over 500,000 copies, though 99% are truncated and defective. However, their abundance and dominant number of defective copies make it challenging to identify authentically expressed L1s from L1-related sequences expressed as part of other genes. It is also challenging to identify which specific L1 locus is expressed due to the repetitive nature of the elements. Overcoming these challenges, we present an RNA-Seq bioinformatic approach to identify L1 expression at the locus specific level. In summary, we collect cytoplasmic RNA, select for polyadenylated transcripts, and utilize strand-specific RNA-Seq analyses to uniquely map reads to L1 loci in the human reference genome. We visually curate each L1 locus with uniquely mapped reads to confirm transcription from its own promoter and adjust mapped transcript reads to account for mappability of each individual L1 locus. This approach was applied to a prostate tumor cell line, DU145, to demonstrate the ability of this protocol to detect expression from a small number of the full-length L1 elements.""","""['Tiffany Kaul', 'Maria E Morales', 'Emily Smither', 'Melody Baddoo', 'Victoria P Belancio', 'Prescott Deininger']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""J Vis Exp""","""['A comprehensive approach to expression of L1 loci.', 'Truncated ORF1 proteins can suppress LINE-1 retrotransposition in trans.', 'Sequencing, identification and mapping of primed L1 elements (SIMPLE) reveals significant variation in full length L1 elements between individuals.', 'Utility of next-generation RNA-sequencing in identifying chimeric transcription involving human endogenous retroviruses.', 'The Human Long Interspersed Element-1 Retrotransposon: An Emerging Biomarker of Neoplasia.', 'A novel role of TRIM28 B box domain in L1 retrotransposition and ORF2p-mediated cDNA synthesis.', 'SCIFER: approach for analysis of LINE-1 mRNA expression in single cells at a single locus resolution.', 'Locus specific reduction of L1 expression in the cortices of individuals with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.', 'Analysis of epigenetic features characteristic of L1 loci expressed in human cells.', 'Organ-, sex-\xa0and age-dependent patterns of endogenous L1 mRNA expression at a single locus resolution.']"""

In practice, Raman dyes (RDs) encoded core-shell SERS nanotags instead of conventional gold colloids used in the colorimetric assay are employed in the sensing membrane of SERS based VFAs for multiplex protein detection.

However, the development of all these types of cancer in a patient without immunodeficiency is very rare. Incidence of urological malignancies increase with aging.

To clarify the molecular events involved in the effect of α-casein on proliferation and progression of PC3 cells, we examined cell proliferation assay, quantitative real-time PCR, Western blotting, and immunohistochemical and immunofluorescence staining. α-casein promoted PC3 cell proliferation and survival under serum-free conditions by increasing the expression of E2F1 and its target gene PCNA. α-casein also protected PC3 cells from serum-starved autophagic cell death by activating the PI3K/Akt pathway through activation of mTORC1, up-regulation of p70S6K, and down-regulation of LC3 autophagosome formation.

Methods:   A total of 390(292 non-TB/98 TB) IRCC-VT Consortium patients who received no preoperative embolization/IVC filter were included. Stepwise linear/logistic regression analyses were performed to determine significant multivariable predictors of intraoperative estimated blood loss(IEBL), number blood transfusions received, and overall/major PC development within 30days following surgery. Propensity to receive the TB approach was controlled.  Results:   The TB approach was clearly superior in limiting IEBL, blood transfusions, and PC development, even after controlling for other significant prognosticators/propensity score(P < .000001 in each case). Median IEBL for non-TB/TB approaches was 1000 cc/300 cc and 1500 cc/500 cc for tumor thrombus Level II-III patients, respectively, with no notable differences for Level IV patients(2000 cc each).

However, devising a method to prevent disease progression is crucial. Carbon anhydrase 9 (CA9) plays a vital role in cell adhesion and intercellular communication correlated to tumor metastasis. Our study explored the impact of CA9 genetic polymorphism on the clinicopathological features and prognosis of CaP.  Materials and methods:   In total, 579 patients with CaP who underwent robot-assisted radical prostatectomy were enrolled, 270 of whom had an initial prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level ≤10 ng/ml and 309 had initial one >10 ng/ml. Three single-nucleotide polymorphisms of CA9 gene were examined using real-time polymerase chain reaction assay.  Results:   After adjusting the confounding factors, participants carrying at least one G allele at CA9 rs3829078 had a 2.241-fold change in PSA compared with the wild-type carrier (AA), leading to an initial PSA level of ≤10 ng/ml. Furthermore, patients with CaP with an initial PSA level ≤10 ng/ml who carried at least one G allele at CA9 rs3829078 had a 4.532-fold and 3.484-fold risk of lymph node metastasis and lymphovascular invasion, respectively. Moreover, The Cancer Genome Atlas database showed that the CA9 mRNA expression significantly increased N1 disease risk and worsened overall survival trends.

Overall and clinically significant cancer detection rate (CDR) of Koelis™ fusion biopsies were assessed, comparing target and systematic biopsies. Secondary endpoint was the identification of predictors of PCa detection.  Results:   The CDR of targeted biopsies only was 48% for all cancers and 33% for csPCa. The performance of additional, systematic prostate sampling improved the CDR of 15% for all cancers and of 12% for csPCa.

We report that in response to pro-metastatic cues (androgen and TGF-β) BRG1 expression was up-regulated along with Elvol3 in prostate cancer cells. BRG1 over-expression potentiated whereas BRG1 knockdown attenuated prostate cancer cell migration and invasion. Coincidently, Elovl3 was up-regulated following BRG1 over-expression and down-regulated after BRG1 knockdown in prostate cancer cells. Further analysis revealed that BRG1 interacted with and was recruited by retinoic acid receptor-related orphan receptor (RORγ) to the Elovl3 promoter to activate transcription. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) profiling demonstrated that BRG1 interacted with histone acetyltransferase p300 to activate Elovl3 transcription. Depletion of p300 by siRNA or inhibition of p300 by curcumin attenuated Elovl3 trans-activation in prostate cancer cells. Together, our data identify a novel epigenetic pathway that links Elovl3 transcription to prostate cancer cell migration and invasion.""","""['Yuyu Yang', 'Li Liu', 'Min Li', 'Xian Cheng', 'Mingming Fang', 'Qingqi Zeng', 'Yong Xu']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Biochim Biophys Acta Gene Regul Mech""","""['Brahma related gene 1 (BRG1) regulates breast cancer cell migration and invasion by activating MUC1 transcription.', 'The chromatin remodeling protein BRG1 regulates APAP-induced liver injury by modulating CYP3A11 transcription in hepatocyte.', 'Brahma-related gene 1 (Brg1) epigenetically regulates CAM activation during hypoxic pulmonary hypertension.', 'Involvement of the chromatin-remodeling factor BRG1/SMARCA4 in human cancer.', 'The BRG1 transcriptional coregulator.', 'MiR-199a-5p-Regulated SMARCA4 Promotes Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma Tumorigenesis.', 'Targeting Chromatin-Remodeling Factors in Cancer Cells: Promising Molecules in Cancer Therapy.', 'Epigenetic modification regulates tumor progression and metastasis through EMT (Review).', 'Lipid Metabolism and Epigenetics Crosstalk in Prostate Cancer.', 'Targeting of noncoding RNAs encoded by a novel MYC enhancers inhibits the proliferation of human hepatic carcinoma cells in vitro.']"""

Hitherto that date, surgical or chemical castration is the standard treatment to PCa. Nevertheless, there are still many patients with initial treatment progress to metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). There are many effective chemotherapeutic drugs for mCRPC, but the tumors will be resistant to these chemotherapeutic drugs, which is an urgent problem to be solved. Specifically, tumor therapy resistance driven by the pathologically active host stroma has gradually becoming the spotlight of oncotherapy in recent years. The exosome-derived miR-27a plays an important role in PCa cell chemoresistance. However, the functions of miR-27a on PCa developing chemoresistance remain unknown. In the present study, we aimed to construct potential regulatory networks of exosomal miR-27a in PCa chemoresistance. The expression of miR-27a was significantly increased by treatment with cisplatin, doxorubicin (DOX) and docetaxel in PCa tissues. We next co-cultured PCa cells (PC3 cells) with primary prostate fibroblasts (PSC27 cells) to explore the mechanisms of tumor therapy resistance. Further studies delineate that exosome-derived miR-27a produced by PSC-27 cells improved chemoresistance by restraining the expression of P53 gene.

However, the inevitable presence of intra- and inter-observer variabilities is challenging in this context. Additionally, pre-contrast T1-time correction is a prerequisite to gain quantitative DCE parameters in the first place. The current study investigated the effect of individualized T1-time correction on intra- and inter-reader variability for quantitative DCE-parameters in prostatic lesions.  Methods:   In this IRB-approved retrospective study, two experienced radiologists assessed DCE parameters using individually measured (A) and fixed (B) T1-times twice with a time difference of three weeks. The dataset consisted of 35 MRI-guided biopsy-proven prostate cancer lesions. Limits of agreement (LoA) and coefficients of variability (CoV) were calculated to assess intra- and inter-reader variabilities of the parameters.  Results:   With exception of kep, for all DCE parameters both intra- and inter-reader CoV were smaller in B compared to A. Absolute kep values were largely insensitive to T1-time correction induced bias. The mean intra-reader CoVs [5%, 95% percentile] (over all four DCE parameters and both readers) were 6.7% [0.5%, 15.1%] in A and 3.9% [0.2%, 11.0%] in B. The inter-reader CoVs were 9.0% [0.6%, 25.8%] (A) and 7.0% [0.3%, 25.4%] (B).  Conclusions:   T1-time correction has a significant influence on the intra- and inter-reader variability. By applying individually measured T1-time correction, both intra- and inter-observer variability were found to increase.

Material and methods:   MRI data of 40 patients with positive transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsy were analyzed retrospectively by two blinded readers (5 and 4 years' experience) with PI-RADS v1 and v2 for cancer-suspicious lesions. Prior to radical prostatectomy, patients had undergone IRB-approved mpMRI at 3 T according to PI-RADS recommendations: T2-weighted (T2w), diffusion-weighted (DWI) and dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) imaging. The reference standard was provided by whole-mount sections of the prostatectomy specimens. Versions v1 and v2 were compared with respect to sensitivity and positive predictive value (PPV) per lesion. Subgroups stratified by tumor location (peripheral vs. transition zone) and aggressiveness (high vs. low grade) were also analyzed. We also evaluated the concordance of the dominant MRI sequence in v2 (DWI or T2w) and the highest individual score under v1. Interobserver agreement for PI-RADS v1 and v2 was assessed by Cohen's kappa statistics.  Results:   Reader 1 (R1) described 66 and Reader 2 (R2) 72 MRI lesions. The average Gleason score of 58 PCa lesions was 6.5 (range: 6 = 3 + 3 to 8 = 4 + 4), most of them (65.5%) located in the peripheral zone. PI-RADS v2 showed a trend towards lower sensitivities, but differences were not significant for both readers: R1 72.4% (v1) vs. 63.8% (v2) (P = 0.426) and R2 77.6% (v1) vs. 69.0% (v2) (P = 0.402). The trends were more pronounced in the transition zone and for low-grade cancers but remained insignificant (p-values from 0.313 to 0.691). Likewise, the apparent PPV differences, overall as well as in each zone, were not significant. Agreement between high-score v1 and dominant v2 sequence was 48% for R1 and 53% for R2. Cohen's κ of PCa detection for two readers was 0.48 for both v1 and v2.  Conclusion:   Our findings indicate that the simplified, zone-specific approach of PI-RADS v2 (2015) for MRI assessment of prostate cancer may not necessarily be better than the original v1 criteria (2012). In specific cases, a strict interpretation of v2 criteria may even lead to false-negative findings. Therefore, the current PI-RADS criteria should be reconsidered, despite the low statistical evidence here.""","""['Alexander Schaudinn', 'Josephin Gawlitza', 'Simone Mucha', 'Nicolas Linder', 'Toni Franz', 'Lars-Christian Horn', 'Thomas Kahn', 'Harald Busse']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Eur J Radiol""","""['Interreader agreement of PI-RADS v. 2 in assessing prostate cancer with multiparametric MRI: A study using whole-mount histology as the standard of reference.', 'Head-to-head comparison of PI-RADS v2 and PI-RADS v1.', 'Assessment of PI-RADS v2 for the Detection of Prostate Cancer.', 'Prostate imaging reporting and data system version 2 (PI-RADS v2): a pictorial review.', 'Multiparametric MRI in detection and staging of prostate cancer.', 'The RADS-Panacea or Pain?', 'Structured reporting in radiologic education - Potential of different PI-RADS versions in prostate MRI controlled by in-bore MR-guided biopsies.', 'Equivocal PI-RADS Three Lesions on Prostate Magnetic Resonance Imaging: Risk Stratification Strategies to Avoid MRI-Targeted Biopsies.', 'Factors Influencing Variability in the Performance of Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging in Detecting Clinically Significant Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Literature Review.', 'How to implement magnetic resonance imaging before prostate biopsy in clinical practice: nomograms for saving biopsies.']"""

Among various parameters, lesion maximum diameter and volume are currently considered of value to increase diagnostic accuracy. Quantitative radiomics allows for the extraction of more advanced shape features. Our aim was to assess which shape features derived from MRI index lesions correlate with csPCa presence.  Materials and methods:   We retrospectively enrolled 75 consecutive subjects, who underwent mpMRI on a 3 T scanner, divided based on MRI index lesion Gleason Score in a csPCa group (GS > 3 + 4, n = 41) and a non-csPCa one (n = 34). Ten shape features were extracted both from axial T2-weighted and ADC maps images, after lesion tridimensional segmentation. Univariable and multivariable logistic analysis were used to evaluate the relationship between shape features and csPCa. Diagnostic performance was assessed measuring the area under the curve of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. Diagnostic accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity were determined using the best cut-off on each ROC. A P value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.  Results:   Univariable analysis demonstrated that almost every shape feature was statistically significant between csPCa e non-csPCa groups. However, multivariable analysis revealed that the parameter defined as surface area to volume ratio (SAVR), especially when extracted from ADC maps is the strongest independent predictor of csPCa among tested shape features.

Methods:   26 consecutive patients with histologically confirmed urothelial carcinoma who received clinically indicated venous- and excretory phase abdominal CT scans were included retrospectively. Attenuation, image noise as well as signal- and contrast-to-noise-ratio (SNR, CNR) in venous and excretory phase CT and excretory phase VMI from 40 to 70 keV were obtained from ROI-based measurements in the following regions: urothelial carcinoma, liver, pancreas, renal cortex, subcutaneous fat, renal vein/artery, portal vein, urinary bladder wall, lymph nodes, prostate/uterus. Subjective vessel contrast and delineation of primary tumor manifestations and distant metastases were rated on 5-point Likert scales.  Results:   In comparison to venous phase CT, attenuation and SNR in excretory phase VMI40keV were higher (p < 0.001), except for liver parenchyma, where they were comparable (p = 0.07 and p = 0.17, respectively). Regarding image noise, no significant difference was found between venous phase CT and excretory phase VMI40keV (p-range: 0.08-1.00), except for liver, portal vein and renal artery, where it was lower in VMI40keV (p < 0.05). CNR of urothelial carcinoma to circumjacent bladder wall was significantly higher in excretory phase VMI40keV compared to venous phase CT. Subjective vessel contrast and delineation of primary tumor and distant metastases received equivalent or higher Likert scores in excretory phase VMI40keV than in venous phase CT.  Conclusion:   This feasibility study indicates that in the assessment of urothelial carcinoma, virtual monoenergetic excretory phase images at 40 keV acquired with spectral DECT could be feasible to maintain subjective and objective image quality as provided by conventional venous phase images.

Methods:   During the first phase five patients enrolled for prostate SBRT were planned by multiple physicists according to common protocol. The prescription dose was 35 Gy in 5 fractions. Dosimetric parameters, modulation index (MIt), plan parameters, and planner experience level (EL) were statistically analyzed. During the second phase median DVHs from all centers were shared and physicists replanned one patient of the five, aiming at inter-planner harmonization and further OARs sparing. Data were summarized by Spearman-correlogram (p < 0.05) and boxplots. The Kruskal-Wallis test was used to compare the re-plans to the original plans.  Results:   Seventy-eight SBRT plans from 13 centers were evaluated. EL correlated with modulation of plan parameters and reduction of OARs doses, such as volume receiving 28 Gy of rectum (rectum-V28Gy), rectum-V32Gy, and bladder-V30Gy. The re-plans showed significant reduced variability in rectum-V28Gy and increased PTV dose homogeneity. No significant difference in plan complexity metrics and plan parameters between plans and re-plans were obtained.

The choice of an optimal total dose value and fractionation regimen for a particular patient can be carried out using the integral radiobiological criteria, namely tumour control probability (TCP) and normal tissue complication probability (NTCP). In this study, we have investigated the dependence of simulated TCP/NTCP values on total dose in the range of 30-40 Gy delivered in 4 or 5 fractions for patients with low-risk prostate cancer in order to find the optimal total dose value and fractionation regimen.  Methods:   The anatomic data (DICOM CT images) of 12 patients with low-risk prostate cancer, who were treated at Tomsk Regional Oncology Centre, were used for the calculation. Dosimetric treatment plans for all patients were simulated using VMAT with 2 arcs in the Monaco treatment planning system v5.10 (Elekta Instrument AB, Stockholm) with a total dose equal to 36.25 Gy. The dosimetric plans were rescaled in the dose range of 30-40 Gy. The TCP and NTCP values were calculated based on differential dose volume histograms using the Niemierko model for both TCP and NTCP, and the Källman-s model for NTCP calculations. The TCP calculation was carried out using the uncertainty of well-known tumour radiobiological parameters values, including α/β value. NTCP was calculated for an anterior rectal wall, which was the most irradiated organ at risk due to its close contact with the planning target volume.  Results:   The TCP and NTCP calculations for VMAT of the prostate cancer have shown that the optimal total dose ranges were equal to 32-34 Gy delivered in 4 fractions or 35-38 Gy delivered in 5 fractions. At doses lower than the optimal ones, the TCP values were lower than 95%, while TCP uncertainties were significant (as low as 80%). This fact might bring unexpectedly poor treatment results. At doses higher than optimal ones, the probability of toxicity to the anterior rectal wall became significant.  Conclusion:   The optimization of radiation therapy regimen based on TCP/NTCP criteria could help to determine an optimal total dose and a number of fractions for a particular patient depending on patient-specific anatomic features and planned dose distribution.""","""['E S Sukhikh', 'L G Sukhikh', 'A V Taletsky', 'A V Vertinsky', 'P V Izhevsky', 'I N Sheino']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Phys Med""","""['Inverse and forward optimization of one- and two-dimensional intensity-modulated radiation therapy-based treatment of concave-shaped planning target volumes: the case of prostate cancer.', 'Radiobiological impact of dose calculation algorithms on biologically optimized IMRT lung stereotactic body radiation therapy plans.', 'Dose-volume and radiobiological dependence on the calculation grid size in prostate VMAT planning.', 'Hypofractionation in prostate cancer: radiobiological basis and clinical appliance.', 'Is the alpha/beta value for prostate tumours low enough to be safely used in clinical trials?', 'A radiobiological comparison of hypo-fractionation versus conventional fractionation for breast cancer 3D-conformal radiation therapy.', 'Individualized Fraction Regimen of SBRT Patients With Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Based on Uncomplicated and Cancer-Free Control Probability.', 'Effect of setup error in the single-isocenter technique on stereotactic radiosurgery for multiple brain metastases.']"""

We estimated odds ratios (OR) of reporting a negative experience of overall cancer care by tumour stage and diagnostic route (crude and adjusted for patient characteristic and cancer site variables) and examined their interactions with cancer site.  Results:   After adjustment, the likelihood of reporting a negative experience was highest for emergency presenters and lowest for screening-detected patients with breast, colon, and rectal cancers (OR versus two-week-wait 1.51, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.24-1.83; 0.88, 95% CI 0.75-1.03, respectively).

The aims of this paper were to describe patterns in waiting time and their association with patient characteristics for colorectal, lung, breast and prostate cancers.  Methods:   National, population-based data from 2007 to 2016 were used. A multivariable quantile regression examined the association between treatment period, age, stage, sex, place of residence, and median waiting times.  Results:   Reduction in median waiting times for radiotherapy among colorectal, lung and prostate cancer patients ranged from 14 to 50 days. Median waiting time for surgery remained approximately 21 days for both colorectal and breast cancers, while it decreased by 7 and 36 days for lung and prostate cancers, respectively. The proportion of lung and prostate cancer patients with metastatic disease at the time of diagnosis decreased, while the proportion of colorectal patients with localised disease and patients with stage I breast cancer increased (p < 0.001). After adjusting for case-mix, a patient's place of residence was significantly associated with waiting time for treatment (p < 0.001), however, differences in waiting time to treatment decreased over the study period.  Conclusions:   Between 2007 and 2016, Norway experienced improved stage distributions and consistently decreasing waiting times for treatment.

However, it is not known whether these pesticide antiandrogens also interfere with rapid (often described as nongenomic, nonclassical) androgen actions mediated by membrane androgen receptors (mARs). We recently discovered that ZIP9, a member of the zinc transporter ZIP (SLC39A) family, is a specific, high-affinity mAR that mediates rapid testosterone-dependent signaling, zinc influx, and apoptosis in breast and prostate cancer cell lines. Possible disruption by prochloraz, vinclozolin, and M2 of androgen actions through this mAR was investigated in vitro in PC-3 prostate cancer cells (nAR-) over expressing human ZIP9 (PC3-ZIP9 cells). Single-point competitive binding assays showed 1 μM and 10 μM concentrations of all three pesticides displaced specific [3H]-testosterone binding to PC3-ZIP9 cell membranes with binding affinities <10% that of testosterone. The pesticides also exerted antiandrogen actions through ZIP9. Co-treatments with 100 nM prochloraz, vinclozolin and M2 blocked or attenuated the 20 nM testosterone-induced increases in apoptosis, intracellular free zinc levels, and expression of the proapoptotic gene, Bax. Prochloraz also attenuated testosterone activation of MAPkinase. The finding that prochloraz, vinclozolin and M2 are effective competitors of [3H]-testosterone binding to ZIP9 and block testosterone actions mediated through ZIP9 in vitro at nanomolar concentrations suggests that androgen functions mediated by ZIP9 are also susceptible to disruption by pesticide antiandrogens with potential adverse effects on human health.""","""['Peter Thomas', 'Jing Dong']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Steroids""","""['(-)-Epicatechin acts as a potent agonist of the membrane androgen receptor, ZIP9 (SLC39A9), to promote apoptosis of breast and prostate cancer cells.', 'Membrane androgen receptor characteristics of human ZIP9 (SLC39A) zinc transporter in prostate cancer cells: Androgen-specific activation and involvement of an inhibitory G protein in zinc and MAP kinase signaling.', 'Identification and characterization of membrane androgen receptors in the ZIP9 zinc transporter subfamily: II.

This study evaluated the efficacy of early initiation of salvage-ADT (S-ADT) based on predetermined timing among patients with unfavorable PCa treated with high-dose intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT).  Materials and methods:   High-risk (HR) and very-high-risk (VHR) PCa patients treated with IMRT at our institution between September 2000 and December 2010 were analyzed retrospectively. Treatment consisted of high-dose IMRT (78 Gy/39 fractions) combined with 6 months of neoadjuvant-ADT (NA-ADT). S-ADT was initiated when prostate-specific antigen levels exceeded 4.0 ng/mL.  Results:   In total, 268 (184 HR and 84 VHR) patients were analyzed. The median follow-up period was 114.4 months. The 10-year overall survival (OS), PCa-specific survival (PCSS), biochemical failure (BF), and clinical failure (CF) rates were 82.8%, 97.1%, 27.3%, and 12.8% among the HR PCa patients and 79.4%, 87.9%, 56.2%, and 26.7% among the VHR PCa patients (p = 0.839, = 0.0377, < 0.001, and < 0.001), respectively. The 10-year cumulative incidence rates of urinary and rectal (grades 2-3) toxicities were 22.6% and 5.8%, respectively. No grade 4 or higher toxicities were observed.  Conclusion:   High-dose IMRT combined with short-term NA-ADT resulted in long-term disease-free status, with acceptable morbidity among approximately three-fourths of the HR PCa patients and nearly half of the VHR PCa patients. Moreover, excellent survival outcomes were achieved by the early S-ADT initiation.

Lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a major compound of Gram-negative bacteria, with stimulatory activities in some cancer types, but has not been fully studied in PCa. In this study, we examined the effect of LPS on the invasion of PCa cells. Interestingly, LPS can enhance the invasiveness of PCa, but had no significant effect on PCa cell viability. Using protease inhibitor screening and biochemical analyses, matriptase, a member of the membrane-anchored serine protease family, is found to play a key role in LPS-induced PCa cell invasion. Mechanistically, Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4, LPS receptor)-sphingosine kinase 1 (SphK1) signaling underlies LPS-induced matriptase activation and PCa cell invasion. Specifically, LPS induced the S225 phosphorylation of SphK1 and the translocation of SphK1 to plasma membrane, leading to the production of sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P), ERK1/2 and matriptase activation via S1P receptor 4 (S1PR4). This phenomenon is further validated using the patient-derived explant (PDE) model. Indeed, there is a significant correlation among the elevated SphK1 levels, the Gleason grades of PCa specimens, and the poor survival of PCa patients. Taken together, this study demonstrates a potential impact of LPS on PCa progression.

Background:   Inhibition of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) signaling abrogates tumor-induced angiogenesis to constrain tumor growth, and can be exploited therapeutically by using cediranib, an oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor of VEGF receptor signaling. Our preliminary phase I trial data showed that adding cediranib to docetaxel plus prednisone (DP) was safe and feasible, with early evidence for efficacy in patients with metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC).  Methods:   This multicenter phase II trial assessed whether adding cediranib to DP improves efficacy of DP in patients with mCRPC.

Monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL) is an enzyme of the endocannabinoid system, and is responsible for the degradation of the most abundant endocannabinoid in bone, 2-arachidonoyl glycerol (2AG).  Methods:   The effects of the verified MAGL inhibitor on bone remodelling were assessed in healthy mice and in mouse models of bone disease caused by prostate and breast cancers and osteosarcoma.  Findings:   JZL184 reduced osteolytic bone metastasis in mouse models of breast and prostate cancers, and inhibited skeletal tumour growth, metastasis and the formation of ectopic bone in models of osteosarcoma. Additionally, JZL184 suppressed cachexia and prolonged survival in mice injected with metastatic osteosarcoma and osteotropic cancer cells. Functional and histological analysis revealed that the osteoprotective action of JZL184 in cancer models is predominately due to inhibition of tumour growth and metastasis. In the absence of cancer, however, exposure to JZL184 exerts a paradoxical reduction of bone volume via an effect that is mediated by both Cnr1 and Cnr2 cannabinoid receptors.  Interpretation:   MAGL inhibitors such as JZL184, or its novel analogues, may be of value in the treatment of bone disease caused by primary bone cancer and bone metastasis, however, activation of the skeletal endocannabinoid system may limit their usefulness as osteoprotective agents.""","""['Silvia Marino', 'Daniëlle de Ridder', 'Ryan T Bishop', 'Nathalie Renema', 'Marco Ponzetti', 'Antonia Sophocleous', 'Mattia Capulli', 'Abdullah Aljeffery', 'Giovana Carrasco', 'Marianela Dalghi Gens', 'Asim Khogeer', 'Stuart H Ralston', 'Jürg Gertsch', 'Francois Lamoureux', 'Dominique Heymann', 'Nadia Rucci', 'Aymen I Idris']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""EBioMedicine""","""['JZL184, A Monoacylglycerol Lipase Inhibitor, Induces Bone Loss in a Multiple Myeloma Model of Immunocompetent Mice.', 'The Monoacylglycerol Lipase Inhibitor JZL184 Inhibits Lung Cancer Cell Invasion and Metastasis via the CB1 Cannabinoid Receptor.', 'Neuroprotective Effect of JZL184 in MPP(+)-Treated SH-SY5Y Cells Through CB2 Receptors.', 'Monocyte Chemoattractant Protein-1 (MCP-1/CCL2) Drives Activation of Bone Remodelling and Skeletal Metastasis.', 'Osteosarcoma and Metastasis Associated Bone Degradation-A Tale of Osteoclast and Malignant Cell Cooperativity.', 'Inhibition of Monoacylglycerol Lipase Decreases Angiogenic Features of Endothelial Cells via Release of Tissue Inhibitor of Metalloproteinase-1 from Lung Cancer Cells.', 'Animal models of cancer metastasis to the bone.', 'The Metabolic Landscape of Breast Cancer and Its Therapeutic Implications.', 'Inhibiting degradation of 2-arachidonoylglycerol as a therapeutic strategy for neurodegenerative diseases.', 'Dysregulated ceramides metabolism by fatty acid 2-hydroxylase exposes a metabolic vulnerability to target cancer metastasis.']"""

Indeed, MRI offers superior soft tissue contrast compared to computerized tomography (CT) and therefore could provide a better delineation of target volumes and organs at risk than CT for radiotherapy. Furthermore, an MRI-only radiotherapy workflow would suppress registration errors inherent to the registration of MRI with CT. However, the estimation of the electronic density of tissues using MRI images is still a challenging issue. The purpose of this work was to design and evaluate a pseudo-CT generation method for prostate cancer treatments.  Materials and methods:   A pseudo-CT was generated for ten prostate cancer patients using an elastic deformation based method. For each patient, dose delivered to the patient was calculated using both the planning CT and the pseudo-CT. Dose differences between CT and pseudo-CT were investigated.  Results:   Mean dose relative difference in the planning target volume is 0.9% on average and ranges from 0.1% to 1.7%. In organs at risks, this value is 1.8%, 0.8%, 0.8% and 1% on average in the rectum, the right and left femoral heads, and the bladder respectively.  Conclusion:   The dose calculated using the pseudo-CT is very close to the dose calculated using the CT for both organs at risk and PTV. These results confirm that pseudo-CT images generated using the proposed method could be used to calculate radiotherapy treatment doses on MRI images.""","""['L Vanquin', 'C Boydev', 'J Korhonen', 'E Rault', 'F Crop', 'T Lacornerie', 'A Wagner', 'J Laffarguette', 'D Pasquier', 'N Reynaert']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Cancer Radiother""","""['An atlas-based electron density mapping method for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-alone treatment planning and adaptive MRI-based prostate radiation therapy.', 'Changes in target volumes definition by using MRI for prostate bed radiotherapy planning--preliminary results.', 'Magnetic resonance only workflow and validation of dose calculations for radiotherapy of prostate cancer.', 'Positron emission tomography for radiation treatment planning.', 'News in magnetic resonance imaging use for radiation oncology.', 'Using a Further Planning MRI after Neoadjuvant Androgen Deprivation Therapy Significantly Reduces the Radiation Exposure of Organs at Risk in External Beam Radiotherapy of Prostate Cancer.']"""

This approach reduced over-detection of low-grade cancer while increasing detection of clinically significant cancer (CSC). Still, important questions remain regarding the reproducibility of these findings outside of a clinical trial and quantifying missed CSC diagnoses using this approach. To address these issues, we retrospectively applied the PRECISION strategy in men who each underwent prebiopsy mpMRI followed by systematic and targeted biopsy.  Methods and materials:   Clinical, imaging, and pathology data were prospectively collected from 358 biopsy naïve men and 202 men with previous negative biopsies. To apply the PRECISION approach, a retrospective analysis was done comparing the cancer yield from 2 diagnostic strategies: (1) mpMRI followed by targeted biopsy alone for men with Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System ≥ 3 lesions and (2) systematic biopsy alone for all men. Primary outcomes were biopsies avoided and the proportion of CSC cancer (Grade Group 2-5) and non-CSC (Grade Group 1).  Results:   In biopsy naïve patients, the mpMRI diagnostic strategy would have avoided 19% of biopsies while detecting 2.5% more CSC (P= 0.480) and 12% less non-CSC (P< 0.001). Thirteen percent (n= 9) of men with normal mpMRI had CSC on systematic biopsy. For previous negative biopsy patients, the mpMRI diagnostic strategy avoided 21% of biopsies, while detecting 1.5% more CSC (P= 0.737) and 13% less non-CSC (P< 0.001). Seven percent (n= 3) of men with normal mpMRI had CSC on systematic biopsy.  Conclusions:   Our results provide external validation of the PRECISION finding that mpMRI followed by targeted biopsy of suspicious lesions reduces biopsies and over-diagnosis of low-grade cancer. Unlike PRECISION, we did not find increased diagnosis of CSC. This was true in both biopsy naïve and previously negative biopsy cohorts. We have incorporated this information into shared decision making, which has led some men to choose to avoid biopsy. However, we continue to recommend targeted and systematic biopsy in men with abnormal MRI.""","""['Nancy N Wang', 'Nikola C Teslovich', 'Richard E Fan', 'Pejman Ghanouni', 'John T Leppert', 'James D Brooks', 'Sarir Ahmadi', 'Geoffrey A Sonn']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Urol Oncol""","""['Prostate Cancer Risk Assessment in Biopsy-naïve Patients: The Rotterdam Prostate Cancer Risk Calculator in Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging-Transrectal Ultrasound (TRUS) Fusion Biopsy and Systematic TRUS Biopsy.', 'Cancer detection rate of prebiopsy MRI with subsequent systematic and targeted biopsy are superior to non-targeting systematic biopsy without MRI in biopsy naïve patients: a retrospective cohort study.', 'Clinical use of the SelectMDx urinary-biomarker test with or without mpMRI in prostate cancer diagnosis: a prospective, multicenter study in biopsy-naïve men.', 'Magnetic resonance imaging in prostate cancer detection and management: a systematic review.', 'Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging in the Diagnosis of Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Review.', 'Transrectal Ultrasound in Prostate Cancer: Current Utilization, Integration with mpMRI, HIFU and Other Emerging Applications.']"""

Using an endorectal balloon (ERB) may help to reduce the dose to the internal pudendal arteries (IPA) by pushing the prostate forward. We tested this hypothesis and evaluated the limits of IPA dose optimization in prostate cancer patients simulated with and without ERB.  Materials and methods:   Twelve patients with localized disease were simulated both with and without ERB. IPA were delineated on every CT after MRI registration. Planning target volumes (PTV) were planned to receive 36.25 Gy in 5 fractions with a VMAT technique. Twenty-four initial plans were generated using a knowledge-based planning software without any specific constraints for IPA. Additional stepwise optimization was performed until stabilization of the IPA dose or trespassing of PTV homogeneity limits.  Results:   Without optimization, the median mean IPA dose (Dmean) was lower with ERB than without (10.5 vs. 12.8 Gy, p = 0.023). After optimization, the IPA Dmean dropped significantly (from 11.1 to 4.8 Gy) without impairing the PTV dose homogeneity and the organs at risk dose constraints. The comparison of the best-optimized plans with and without ERB showed an optimal sparing of IPA using ERB (28% mean dose reduction, p = 0.006; median Dmean of 4.1 Gy vs. 5.7 Gy with and without ERB, respectively).  Conclusion:   IPA dose sparing is feasible without compromising dose prescription and constraints. ERB significantly reduced the dose on IPA compared to plans generated without ERB. As no specific constraints are available for vessel-sparing SBRT, optimal IPA dose reduction should be recommended to maximize EF preservation.""","""['Maud Jaccard', 'Giorgio Lamanna', 'Angèle Dubouloz', 'Michel Rouzaud', 'Raymond Miralbell', 'Thomas Zilli']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Phys Med""","""['Urethra-sparing stereotactic body radiotherapy for prostate cancer: how much can the rectal wall dose be reduced with or without an endorectal balloon?', 'Dominant intraprostatic lesion boosting in sexual-sparing radiotherapy of prostate cancer: A planning feasibility study.', 'Dosimetric and deformation effects of image-guided interventions during stereotactic body radiation therapy of the prostate using an endorectal balloon.', 'Penile bulb sparing in prostate cancer radiotherapy : Dose analysis of an in-house MRI system to improve contouring.', 'Robust optimization in lung treatment plans accounting for geometric uncertainty.', 'Assessing Inter-Fraction Changes in The Size and Position of The Penile Bulb During Daily MR-Guided Radiation Therapy to The Prostate Bed: Do We Need to Adjust How We Plan Radiation in The Post-Radical Prostatectomy Setting to Reduce Risk of Erectile Dysfunction?', 'Dosimetric feasibility of neurovascular bundle-sparing stereotactic body radiotherapy with periprostatic hydrogel spacer for localized prostate cancer to preserve erectile function.']"""

Early changes in prostate-specific antigen while on abiraterone in patients with metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer potentially have financial and health implications for patients. Limited data is available on early prostate-specific antigen change and subsequent survival given phase III trials did not measure prostate-specific antigen changes before 12 weeks.  Methods:   A single-center retrospective study was performed. Metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer patients treated with abiraterone (without prior enzalutamide) at Tulane Cancer Center were reviewed with a focus on early prostate-specific antigen decline and relationship to overall survival.  Results:   A total of 110 patients were analyzed for prostate-specific antigen response of ≥ 30 and > 50% at 4, 8, and 12 weeks. A prostate-specific antigen response of either > 30% or > 50% at 4, 8, or 12 weeks was associated with improved overall survival at all time points except > 50% decline at 8 weeks. Multivariate analysis indicated, for all time points, that early prostate-specific antigen declines were predictive of overall survival. The neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio and docetaxel pretreatment also were predictive in many, but not all, of the multivariate analyses.  Conclusions:   A > 30% or > 50% prostate-specific antigen decline at 4, 8, or 12 weeks provides important information regarding subsequent overall survival for patients with metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer. While these data require validation with a large, multi-institutional trial, they can provide physicians with information regarding prognosis and the timing of expected outcomes.

Despite superior soft tissue contrast in MRI, one of the challenges towards MRI-only workflows is that the process often requires some sort of 'MR-invisible' metal-based devices. In this study, the feasibility of quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) for visualization of some MR-invisible radiation therapy devices was studied. Our recently proposed QSM-based algorithm for brachytherapy seed visualization was modified and the feasibility of the optimized algorithm for visualization of different devices including: brachytherapy seeds, plastic interstitial needles, CT-markers and obturators, and different types of fiducial markers in agar, prostate and meat phantoms were studied. All phantoms were scanned using 3T MR scanner with a 3D multi-echo gradient recalled echo (ME-GRE) pulse sequence. The QSM results in all phantoms were compared to CT images for spatial accuracy of the QSM. The applied post-processing algorithm was found to be insensitive to the seeds' type; also, presence of nearby calcifications had no effect on seed visualization. QSM successfully generated positive contrast for both types of investigated fiducial markers with high spatial accuracy compared to CT. Interstitial needles containing both aluminum-based CT-maker and titanium-based obturators were accurately depicted on the QSM. The proposed QSM-based technique relies on the standard MR pulse sequences and visualize the conventional MR-invisible metallic devices with CT-like positive contrast solely through post-processing. Upon in vivo validation of the technique, QSM may have the potential to replace CT for an MR-only guided radiation therapy.""","""['Reyhaneh Nosrati', 'Moti Paudel', 'Ananth Ravi', 'Ana Pejovic-Milic', 'Gerard Morton', 'Greg J Stanisz']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Phys Med Biol""","""['Feasibility of an MRI-only workflow for postimplant dosimetry of low-dose-rate prostate brachytherapy: Transition from phantoms to patients.', 'MRI-based automated detection of implanted low dose rate (LDR) brachytherapy seeds using quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) and unsupervised machine learning (ML).', 'Postimplant Dosimetry of Permanent Prostate Brachytherapy: Comparison of MRI-Only and CT-MRI Fusion-Based Workflows.', 'Clinical quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM): Biometal imaging and its emerging roles in patient care.', 'Role of Prostate MR Imaging in Radiation Oncology.', 'Delineation of prostatic calcification using quantitative susceptibility mapping: Spatial accuracy for magnetic resonance-only radiotherapy planning.']"""

We show that CDK9 inhibition induces acute metabolic stress in prostate cancer cells. This is manifested by a drastic down-regulation of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, ATP depletion and induction of a rapid and sustained phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), the key sensor of cellular energy homeostasis. We used metabolomics to demonstrate that inhibition of CDK9 leads to accumulation of acyl-carnitines, metabolic intermediates in fatty acid oxidation (FAO).

Subsequently, Fe3O4 NPs anchored on the probes were transformed into a photothermal agent, Prussian blue NPs, which converted biological signal into heat via the near-infrared laser irradiation, and thus sensitive quantitative detection of PSA was realized by using a thermometer with a lower detection limit of 0.31 ng/mL. Meanwhile, Prussian blue NPs displayed multiply colors by mixing with potassium ferricyanide, and rapid qualitative detection by naked eyes was realized. The two sets of data mutually validate each other, which greatly improved the accuracy and reliability of PSA detection. More strikingly, graphene oxide as the enrichment carrier of Fe3O4 NPs significantly enhanced the accumulation of Prussian blue NPs in situ, and thus the signal amplification was effectively accomplished. Besides, the sensing strategy avoided the use of enzyme and simplified analysis process. Such a cost-effective and sensitive dual-readout visual protocol opens up new perspectives for personalized diagnosis and on-site detection.""","""['Yunyun Wei', 'Danni Wang', 'Yingzhi Zhang', 'Jinhong Sui', 'Zhangrun Xu']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Biosens Bioelectron""","""['Reduced graphene oxide/BiFeO3 nanohybrids-based signal-on photoelectrochemical sensing system for prostate-specific antigen detection coupling with magnetic microfluidic device.', 'A concentration-dependent multicolor conversion strategy for ultrasensitive colorimetric immunoassay with the naked eye.', 'A colorimetric and photothermal dual-mode biosensing platform based on nanozyme-functionalized flower-like DNA structures for tumor-derived exosome detection.', 'Graphene oxide@gold nanorods-based multiple-assisted electrochemiluminescence signal amplification strategy for sensitive detection of prostate specific antigen.', 'Noble Metal Nanoparticle-Based Multicolor Immunoassays: An Approach toward Visual Quantification of the Analytes with the Naked Eye.', 'Multifunctional carbon nanomaterials for diagnostic applications in infectious diseases and tumors.', 'Aptamer-based biosensors and application in tumor theranostics.', 'A sensitive photothermometric biosensor based on redox reaction-controlled nanoprobe conversion from Prussian blue to Prussian white.', 'Recent Advances in Aptamer Sensors.', 'A novel immunosensor for the monitoring of PSA using binding of biotinylated antibody to the prostate specific antigen based on nano-ink modified flexible paper substrate: efficient method for diagnosis of cancer using biosensing technology.']"""

Methods:   From the Cancer of the Prostate Strategic Urologic Research Endeavor registry (1990-2017), 2209 men with adverse features (pT3N0M0 disease and/or positive surgical margins), and 108 men with positive lymph nodes (pN1) at RP were identified. Temporal trends were evaluated, and predictors of adjuvant therapy were assessed with multivariate logistic regression. Kaplan-Meier analysis and competing risks regression were used to test cumulative incidence and risk of all-cause and prostate cancer-specific mortality.  Results:   Of 2209 men with adverse features and pN0 disease, 89 (4.0%), 82 (3.7%), and 30 (1.4%) received adjuvant external beam radiation therapy (ERBT) alone, androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) alone, or combined EBRT and ADT, respectively. Of 108 men with pN1 disease, 54 (50%) received ADT with or without EBRT. Adjuvant treatment for patients with adverse features decreased from 13.3% (1990-1994) to 6% or less (2005-2017, Ptrend <.001). Patients with margin positive pT3a (odds ratio 4.13; 95% confidence interval 2.21-7.73; P<.01) and margin positive pT3b disease (odds ratio 7.09; 95% confidence interval 3.66-1.73; P<.01) had greater odds of receiving adjuvant therapy compared to patients with margin negative pT3a disease. Adverse feature type was associated with prostate cancer-specific mortality in univariate analysis (log-rank P <.01), but not in competing risks regression (P= .06).  Conclusion:   Adjuvant therapy declined for men with adverse features at RP.

Whether the addition of apalutamide to androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT) would prolong radiographic progression-free survival and overall survival as compared with placebo plus ADT among patients with metastatic, castration-sensitive prostate cancer has not been determined.  Methods:   In this double-blind, phase 3 trial, we randomly assigned patients with metastatic, castration-sensitive prostate cancer to receive apalutamide (240 mg per day) or placebo, added to ADT. Previous treatment for localized disease and previous docetaxel therapy were allowed. The primary end points were radiographic progression-free survival and overall survival.  Results:   A total of 525 patients were assigned to receive apalutamide plus ADT and 527 to receive placebo plus ADT. The median age was 68 years. A total of 16.4% of the patients had undergone prostatectomy or received radiotherapy for localized disease, and 10.7% had received previous docetaxel therapy; 62.7% had high-volume disease, and 37.3% had low-volume disease. At the first interim analysis, with a median of 22.7 months of follow-up, the percentage of patients with radiographic progression-free survival at 24 months was 68.2% in the apalutamide group and 47.5% in the placebo group (hazard ratio for radiographic progression or death, 0.48; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.39 to 0.60; P<0.001). Overall survival at 24 months was also greater with apalutamide than with placebo (82.4% in the apalutamide group vs. 73.5% in the placebo group; hazard ratio for death, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.51 to 0.89; P = 0.005). The frequency of grade 3 or 4 adverse events was 42.2% in the apalutamide group and 40.8% in the placebo group; rash was more common in the apalutamide group.  Conclusions:   In this trial involving patients with metastatic, castration-sensitive prostate cancer, overall survival and radiographic progression-free survival were significantly longer with the addition of apalutamide to ADT than with placebo plus ADT, and the side-effect profile did not differ substantially between the two groups.

In the current study, the authors sought to characterize AS use and early mortality outcomes for patients with intermediate-risk PCa in the United States.  Methods:   The novel Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Active Surveillance/Watchful Waiting database identified 52,940 men diagnosed with National Comprehensive Cancer Network intermediate-risk PCa (cT2b-c, Gleason score of 7, or a prostate-specific antigen level of 10-20 ng/mL) and actively managed (AS, radiotherapy, or radical prostatectomy) from 2010 through 2015. The Cuzick test assessed AS time trends, and logistic multivariable regression characterized features associated with AS. Fine-Gray and Cox modeling determined PCa-specific mortality (PCSM) and overall survival, respectively.  Results:   The rate of AS increased from 3.7% in 2010 to 7.3% in 2015, and from 7.2% to 11.7% among men aged ≥70 years. Among men with favorable and unfavorable intermediate-risk disease, the use of AS increased from 7.2% to 14.9% and from 2.2% to 3.8%, respectively (all P value for trend, <.001). The mean age of those patients managed with AS decreased from 69.9 years to 67.9 years (P = .0004). Factors found to be associated with AS included favorable risk disease; black race; higher socioeconomic status; older age; and diagnosis in the West, Northwest, or Midwest regions of the United States. The 5-year PCSM rate was comparable to AS versus treatment among patients with low-risk and favorable intermediate-risk disease, but was worse with AS among those with unfavorable intermediate-risk disease (PCSM, 1.3% vs 0.5%; adjusted hazard ratio, 2.48 [95% CI, 1.11-5.50; P = .026]) and intermediate-risk disease overall (PCSM, 1.1% vs 0.4%; adjusted hazard ratio, 2.34 [95% CI, 1.25-4.37; P = .008]).

OGT modifies intra-cellular proteins via single sugar conjugation (O-GlcNAcylation) to alter their activity. We recently discovered the first fast-acting OGT inhibitor OSMI-2. Here, we probe the stability and function of the chromatin O-GlcNAc and identify transcription factors that coordinate with OGT to promote proliferation of prostate cancer cells. Methods: Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) coupled to sequencing (seq), formaldehyde-assisted isolation of regulatory elements, RNA-seq and reverse-phase protein arrays (RPPA) were used to study the importance of OGT for chromatin structure and transcription. Mass spectrometry, western blot, RT-qPCR, cell cycle analysis and viability assays were used to establish the role of OGT for MYC-related processes. Prostate cancer patient data profiled for both mRNA and protein levels were used to validate findings. Results: We show for the first time that OGT inhibition leads to a rapid loss of O-GlcNAc chromatin mark. O-GlcNAc ChIP-seq regions overlap with super-enhancers (SE) and MYC binding sites. OGT inhibition leads to down-regulation of SE-dependent genes. We establish the first O-GlcNAc chromatin consensus motif, which we use as a bait for mass spectrometry. By combining the proteomic data from oligonucleotide enrichment with O-GlcNAc and MYC ChIP-mass spectrometry, we identify host cell factor 1 (HCF-1) as an interaction partner of MYC. Inhibition of OGT disrupts this interaction and compromises MYC's ability to confer androgen-independent proliferation to prostate cancer cells. We show that OGT is required for MYC-mediated stabilization of mitotic proteins, including Cyclin B1, and/or the increased translation of their coding transcripts. This implies that increased expression of mRNA is not always required to achieve increased protein expression and confer aggressive phenotype. Indeed, high expression of Cyclin B1 protein has strong predictive value in prostate cancer patients (p=0.000014) while mRNA does not. Conclusions: OGT promotes SE-dependent gene expression. OGT activity is required for the interaction between MYC and HCF-1 and expression of MYC-regulated mitotic proteins. These features render OGT essential for the androgen-independent, MYC-driven proliferation of prostate cancer cells. Androgen-independency is the major mechanism of prostate cancer progression, and our study identifies OGT as an essential mediator in this process.""","""['Harri M Itkonen', 'Alfonso Urbanucci', 'Sara Es Martin', 'Aziz Khan', 'Anthony Mathelier', 'Bernd Thiede', 'Suzanne Walker', 'Ian G Mills']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Theranostics""","""['O-GlcNAc transferase integrates metabolic pathways to regulate the stability of c-MYC in human prostate cancer cells.', 'mTOR/MYC Axis Regulates O-GlcNAc Transferase Expression and O-GlcNAcylation in Breast Cancer.', 'O-GlcNAc transferase couples MRE11 to transcriptionally active chromatin to suppress DNA damage.', 'The Biochemistry of O-GlcNAc Transferase: Which Functions Make It Essential in Mammalian Cells?', 'A critical perspective of the diverse roles of O-GlcNAc transferase in chromatin.', 'GATA2 co-opts TGFβ1/SMAD4 oncogenic signaling and inherited variants at 6q22 to modulate prostate cancer progression.', 'Upregulation of HCFC1 expression promoted hepatocellular carcinoma progression through inhibiting cell cycle arrest and correlated with immune infiltration.', 'Cancer-associated fibroblast-secreted glucosamine alters the androgen biosynthesis program in prostate cancer via HSD3B1 upregulation.', 'OGT and FLAD1 Genes Had Significant Prognostic Roles in Progressive Pathogenesis in Prostate Cancer.', 'Advancements in Oncoproteomics Technologies: Treading toward Translation into Clinical Practice.']"""

In a majority of these recurrent tumors, the androgen axis is reactivated in the form of increased androgen receptor (AR) expression. Targeting proteins that are expressed as a down-stream effect of AR activity is a promising rationale for management of this disease. The humanized IgG1 antibody hu11B6 internalizes into prostate and prostate cancer (PCa) cells by binding to the catalytic cleft of human kallikrein 2 (hK2), a prostate specific enzyme governed by the AR-pathway. In a previous study, hu11B6 conjugated with Actinium-225 (225Ac), a high linear energy transfer (LET) radionuclide, was shown to generate an AR-upregulation driven feed-forward mechanism that is believed to enhance therapeutic efficacy. We assessed the efficacy of hu11B6 labeled with a low LET beta-emitter, Lutetium-177 (177Lu) and investigated whether similar tumor killing and AR-enhancement is produced. Moreover, single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging of 177Lu is quantitatively accurate and can be used to perform treatment planning. [177Lu]hu11B6 therefore has significant potential as a theranostic agent. Materials and Methods: Subcutaneous PCa xenografts (LNCaP s.c.) were grown in male mice. Biokinetics at 4-336 h post injection and uptake as a function of the amount of hu11B6 injected at 72 h were studied. Over a 30 to 120-day treatment period the therapeutic efficacy of different activities of [177Lu]hu11B6 were assessed by volumetric tumor measurements, blood cell counts, molecular analysis of the tumor as well as SPECT/CT imaging. Organ specific mean absorbed doses were calculated, using a MIRD-scheme, based on biokinetic data and rodent specific S-factors from a modified MOBY phantom. Tumor tissues of treated xenografts were immunohistochemically (IHC) stained for Ki-67 (proliferation) and AR, SA-β-gal activity (senescence) and analyzed by digital autoradiography (DAR). Results: Organ-to-blood and tumor-to-blood ratios were independent of hu11B6 specific activity except for the highest amount of antibody (150 µg). Tumor accumulation of [177Lu]hu11B6 peaked at 168 h with a specific uptake of 29 ± 9.1 percent injected activity per gram (%IA/g) and low accumulation in normal organs except in the submandibular gland (15 ± 4.5 %IA/g), attributed to a cross-reaction with mice kallikreins in this organ, was seen. However, SPECT imaging with therapeutic amounts of [177Lu]hu11B6 revealed no peak in tumor accumulation at 7 d, probably due to cellular retention of 177Lu and decreasing tumor volumes. For [177Lu]hu11B6 treated mice, tumor decrements of up to 4/5 of the initial tumor volume and reversible myelotoxicity with a nadir at 12 d were observed after a single injection. Tumor volume reduction correlated with injected activity and the absorbed dose. IHC revealed retained expression of AR throughout treatment and that Ki-67 staining reached a nadir at 9-14 d which coincided with high SA- β-gal activity (14 d). Quantification of nuclei staining showed that Ki-67 expression correlated negatively with activity uptake. AR expression levels in cells surviving therapy compared to previous timepoints and to controls at 30 d were significantly increased (p = 0.017). Conclusions: This study shows that hu11B6 labeled with the low LET beta-emitting radionuclide 177Lu can deliver therapeutic absorbed doses to prostate cancer xenografts with transient hematological side-effects. The tumor response correlated with the absorbed dose both on a macro and a small scale dosimetric level. Analysis of AR staining showed that AR protein levels increased late in the study suggesting a therapeutic mechanism, a feed forward mechanism coupled to AR driven response to DNA damage or clonal lineage selection, similar to that reported in high LET alpha-particle therapy using 225Ac labeled hu11B6, however emerging at a later timepoint.""","""['Oskar Vilhelmsson Timmermand', 'Jörgen Elgqvist', 'Kai A Beattie', 'Anders Örbom', 'Erik Larsson', 'Sophie E Eriksson', 'Daniel L J Thorek', 'Bradley J Beattie', 'Thuy A Tran', 'David Ulmert', 'Sven-Erik Strand']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Theranostics""","""['Genetic signature of prostate cancer mouse models resistant to optimized hK2 targeted α-particle therapy.', 'Panitumumab Modified with Metal-Chelating Polymers (MCP) Complexed to 111In and 177Lu-An EGFR-Targeted Theranostic for Pancreatic Cancer.', 'Towards Personalized Treatment of Prostate Cancer: PSMA I&T, a Promising Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen-Targeted Theranostic Agent.', 'Prostate-specific membrane antigen theranostics: therapy with lutetium-177.', 'Antibodies targeting Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen positive prostate cancer: from diagnostic imaging to theranostics.', 'PSMA-Targeted Nanotheranostics for Imaging and Radiotherapy of Prostate Cancer.', 'A Review on Tumor Control Probability (TCP) and Preclinical Dosimetry in Targeted Radionuclide Therapy (TRT).', 'Hematological Toxicity in Mice after High Activity Injections of 177Lu-PSMA-617.', 'A review of advances in the last decade on targeted cancer therapy using 177Lu: focusing on 177Lu produced by the direct neutron activation route.', 'Intraperitoneal Pretargeted Radioimmunotherapy for Colorectal Peritoneal Carcinomatosis.']"""

The aim of the study is to prospectively analyze QoL after RALP according to the validated European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire prostate cancer-specific module (EORTC-QLQ-PR25) and C30 and explore risk factors for the deterioration of QoL after surgery. A total of 584 patients undergoing RALP were prospectively enrolled. QoL was assessed with the validated EORTC-QLQ-PR25 and C30. Differences across QoL items were assessed via Wilcoxon rank-sum test and associations between risk factors and QoL scores were tested via univariate and multivariate linear regression analyses. All items of the PR25 questionnaire showed a significant deterioration at 1 month after RALP and began to normalize 3 months after surgery. At 24 months follow-up, urinary, bowel, and sexual activity scores were not significantly different from preoperative scores, while incontinence aid, treatment-related symptoms, and sexual functioning remained significantly worse. Preoperative sexual activity was more important in determining 3-month sexual outcomes than preoperative 5-item version of the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF-5) or nerve-sparing approach. An overall return to preoperative QoL was registered at 3 months after RALP in global and physical QoL, and most important, global, physical, social, and role-functioning QoL scores were improved at 12 and 24 months compared to preoperative scores.

Patients and methods:   Clinical phase II studies (2003-2015) included 50 consecutive patients with post-brachytherapy local recurrence treated by S-HIFU. S-HIFU was performed with post-external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) parameters and, since 2008, with specific post-brachytherapy parameters. Treatments were whole-gland ablation and, since 2009, hemi-ablation in cases of unilateral prostate cancer. The primary objective was to assess oncological outcomes: treatment failure-free survival, progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), cancer-specific survival (CSS), and metastasis-free survival (MFS) rates. The secondary objective was to evaluate adverse events, continence, and erectile function. Kaplan-Meier analysis estimated oncological outcomes.  Results:   In all, 13 patients were treated with post-EBRT parameters, 37 with post-brachytherapy parameters, 35 with whole-gland treatment, and 15 with hemi-ablation. The median follow-up was 4.6 years. After S-HIFU, the median prostate-specific antigen level was 0.3 ng/mL. At 6 years, treatment failure-free survival, PFS, OS, CSS, and MFS rates were 41%, 45%, 93%, 98%, and 80%, respectively. Post-brachytherapy compared with post-EBRT parameters reduced Grade 2-3 incontinence (34% vs 62%, P = 0.015). Incontinence, bladder outlet obstruction and Grade ≥III complications were significantly reduced with hemi-ablation compared with whole-gland treatment (14% vs 54%, P < 0.001; 13% vs 46%, P = 0.03; 13% vs 63%, P = 0.001; respectively). Before S-HIFU, 25 patients had a five-item version of the International Index of Erectile Function score of ≥17, which was maintained in 48% at 12 months.  Conclusion:   S-HIFU for locally recurrent prostate cancer after LDR brachytherapy is associated with favourable survival rates at a price of significant morbidity.

Alpha-emitter 223Radium is associated with a clear survival benefit and significant bone pain palliation in CRPC patients with symptomatic bone metastases. The aim of this study was to evaluate the association between pain relief and psychological distress during the time course of therapy in patients treated with 223Radium.  Methods:   A total of 63 patients with mCRPC undergoing 223Radium treatment in our Nuclear Medicine Unit, carefully instructed on the possibility of improving the pain and increasing the survival by the treatment, were retrospectively evaluated. Pain response during treatment was assessed with the Brief Pain Inventory Numeric Rating Scale. Psychological distress was evaluated through the analysis of specific items from EORTC QoL questionnaires C30 and BM22, submitted to patients at baseline and after each 223Radium cycle.  Results:   Pain intensity showed a significant decrease after first 223Radium administration (-1.03 points, p = 0.0032), with a subsequent stability through the course of treatment (-1.30 points, p = <0.001). Psychological status did not show significant variations during 223Radium treatment, and no association was found between psychological status and pain relief in our population.  Conclusions:   In our experience, bone pain palliation provided by 223Radium do not correlate with an improved psychological status in patients with advanced PC.

Methods:   Ground truth arterial input function (AIF), tumor, and healthy tissue contrast agent concentration-time curves (CTCs) were established within the phantom and repeatedly measured on a 3T MRI scanner with varying temporal resolution (Tres = 1.22-30.6 s). Ground truth CTCs, Ktrans , ve , and kep values were directly compared to measured values as a function of Tres , with and without the application of voxel-wise flip-angle corrections applied to the data and PK modeling performed using linear and nonlinear forms of the standard Tofts model.  Results:   Measurement of the AIF was strongly affected by the Tres used (AIF curve-shape feature errors: 3%-222% for Tres : 1.22-30.6 s), which directly translated to errors in the derived Ktrans , ve , and kep values of 1%-24%, 2%-5%, and 1%-26% respectively across this Tres range (flip-angle correction applied). Further appreciable improvements in accuracy and precision arising from the use of flip angle corrections and nonlinear least squares fitting were quantified and used to identify optimal acquisition and analysis methodologies for which measurement errors could be constrained below threshold levels.  Conclusion:   This quantitative study provides insight into how errors in AIF measurement propagate to errors in PK parameter outputs. Absolute quantification of the accuracy and precision of MR-measured CTCs, and resultant PK parameter values, allowed for an optimal temporal resolution to be defined commensurate with maintaining Ktrans , ve , and kep measurement errors below 5% and 10% levels.

Earlier reports has shown that Brb not only augments the efficacy of antineoplastic chemotherapy and radiotherapy, but it also exhibits direct anti-mitotic, and pro-apoptotic activities, plus significant anti-angiogenic and anti-metastatic activities in a variety of solid tumors. Notwithstanding its low systemic toxicity, a few pharmaceutical limitations severely hamper the application of Brb in cancer therapy (namely, very slight aqueous solubility and exceedingly low membrane permeability; combined with poor systemic pharmacokinetic, PK, profile).Lipid-based nanocarriers, amphiphilic mixed micelles (Mic) composed of polymeric phospholipid conjugates and PEG-succinate ester of tocopherol were investigated as promising strategy, to improve Brb delivery into tumors. Following physicochemical characterization of micellar Brb, in vitro release studies in simulated physiological media were performed, combined with PK-simulation and in vitro assays of cytotoxicity and direct apoptosis induction in different human prostate cancer cell lines (PC3 and LNPaC).Optimized stealth PEG-PE/TPGS-mixed micelles achieved efficient solubilization of Brb to potentially improve its systemic PK profiles (>30-fold).

Older Adults' Cancer Screening Intentions and Recalled Discussions with Physicians About Stopping""","""Background:   National guidelines recommend against cancer screening for older individuals with less than a 10-year life expectancy, but it is unknown if this population desires ongoing screening.  Objective:   To determine (1) if older individuals with < 10-year life expectancy have future intentions for cancer screening, (2) if they recall a doctor previously suggesting that screening is no longer needed, and (3) individual characteristics associated with intentions to seek screening.  Design:   National Social life Health and Aging Project (2015-2016), a nationally representative, cross-sectional survey.  Participants:   Community-dwelling adults 55-97 years old (n = 3816).  Main measures:   Self-reported: (1) mammography and PSA testing within the last 2 years, (2) future intentions to be screened, and (3) discussion with a doctor that screening is no longer needed. Ten-year life expectancy was estimated using the Lee prognostic index. Multivariate logistic regression analysis examined intentions to pursue future screening, adjusting for sociodemographic and health covariates.  Key results:   Among women 75-84 with < 10-year life expectancy, 59% intend on future mammography and 81% recall no conversation with a doctor that mammography may no longer be necessary. Among men 75-84 with < 10-year life expectancy, 54% intend on future PSA screening and 77% recall no discussions that PSA screening may be unnecessary. In adjusted analyses, those reporting recent cancer screening or no recollection that screening may not be necessary were more likely to want future mammography or PSA screening (p < 0.001).  Conclusion:   Over 75% of older individuals with limited life expectancy intend to continue cancer screening, and less than 25% recall discussing with physicians the need for these tests. In addition to public health and education efforts, these results suggest that older adults' recollection of being told by physicians that screening is not necessary may be a modifiable risk factor for reducing overscreening in older adults with limited life expectancy.""","""['Ashwin A Kotwal', 'Louise C Walter', 'Sei J Lee', 'William Dale']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""J Gen Intern Med""","""['How Do Older Adults Consider Age, Life Expectancy, Quality of Life, and Physician Recommendations When Making Cancer Screening Decisions?

Materials and methods:   We extracted data from the World Health Organization mortality database for 24 cancer sites, 36 European countries and the European Union (EU) as a whole over the 1990-2017 period. We computed age-standardized death rates per 100 000 person-years, and we carried out a joinpoint regression analysis of mortality trends from all cancers and selected major neoplasms. The estimated annual percent change (APC) for each identified linear segment, and the weighted average APC (AAPC) over the entire study period were provided as summary measures of the changes in rates over the time period.  Results:   In 2015, the age-standardized mortality rates from all cancers in the EU were 137.5 deaths per 100 000 in men and 85.7 in women. Eastern European countries showed the highest rates with values over 150 deaths per 100 000 in men and over 100 deaths per 100 000 in women. Mortality from all cancers in the EU declined annually by 1.5% in men since 2006 and by 0.8% in women since 2007. Most cancer sites showed decreasing trends, with steady declines over the whole period for cancers of stomach, intestines, lung in men, breast and prostate. Unfavourable mortality trends persisted for cancers of liver, lung in women, pancreas, besides skin and kidney in men.  Conclusions:   The downward trends in total cancer mortality in Europe still continue over the last decade. However, the trends were less favourable in most eastern European countries.

Objective:   To determine whether changes in serial mpMRI can predict pathological upgrade among men with grade group (GG) 1 PCa managed with AS.  Design, setting, and participants:   Retrospective analysis of men with GG1 on AS with at least two consecutive mpMRI examinations during 2012-2018 who underwent mpMRI/ultrasound fusion or systematic biopsies.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Progression on serial mpMRI was evaluated as a predictor of pathological upgrading to GG≥2 on a follow-up biopsy using clinical, pathological, and imaging factors in binary logistic regression. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and accuracy were determined.  Results and limitations:   Of 122 patients, 29 men (23.8%) experienced pathological upgrade on the follow-up biopsy. Progression on mpMRI was not associated with pathological upgrade. The sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV of mpMRI progression for predicting pathological upgrade were 41.3%, 54.8%, 22.2%, and 75%, respectively. Age (odds ratio [OR] 1.17, p=0.006), Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) score on initial mpMRI (4-5 vs ≤3, OR 7.48, p=0.01), number of positive systematic cores (OR 1.84, p=0.03), number of positive targeted cores (OR 0.44, p=0.04), and maximum percent of targeted core tumor involvement (OR 1.04, p=0.01) were significantly associated with pathological upgrade.  Conclusions:   We did not observe an association between mpMRI progression and pathological upgrade; however, a PI-RADS score of 4-5 on initial mpMRI was predictive of subsequent pathological progression. The continued use of systematic and fusion biopsies appears necessary due to risks of reclassification over time.  Patient summary:   Progression on serial multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging during active surveillance (AS) is not associated with progression on the follow-up biopsy. Both systematic and fusion biopsies are necessary to sufficiently capture progression during AS.""","""['Walter Hsiang', 'Kamyar Ghabili', 'Jamil S Syed', 'Justin Holder', 'Kevin A Nguyen', 'Alfredo Suarez-Sarmiento', 'Steffen Huber', 'Michael S Leapman', 'Preston C Sprenkle']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Eur Urol Focus""","""['Multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging facilitates reclassification during active surveillance for prostate cancer.', 'Diagnostic Accuracy and Prognostic Value of Serial Prostate Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging in Men on Active Surveillance for Prostate Cancer.', 'The Use of Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging for Follow-up of Patients Included in Active Surveillance Protocol.

Thus, there is a need for long-term predictions of disease trajectories to inform patients and healthcare professionals on the long-term outcomes and provide information on the need of future health care. Here, we propose a state transition model to describe and predict disease trajectories up to 25 years after diagnosis in men with prostate cancer (PCa), as a proof of principle.  Methods:   States, state transitions, and transition probabilities were identified and estimated in Prostate Cancer data Base of Sweden (PCBaSeTraject), using nationwide population-based data from 118,743 men diagnosed with PCa. A state transition model in discrete time steps (i.e., 4 weeks) was developed and applied to capture all possible transitions (PCBaSeSim). Transition probabilities were estimated for changes in both treatment and comorbidity. These models combined yielded parameter estimates to run an individual-level simulation based on the state-transition model to obtain prediction estimates. Predicted estimates were then compared to real world data in PCBaSeTraject.  Results:   PCBaSeSim estimates for the cumulative incidence of first and second transitions, death from PCa and death from other causes were compared to observed transitions in PCBaSeTraject. A good agreement was found between simulated and observed estimates.

This fact prompted questions about the lineage relationship between differentiated, more treatable prostate adenocarcinoma and poorly differentiated, less treatable non-adenocarcinoma including small cell carcinoma, and the molecular mechanism underlying prostate cancer differentiation.  Methods:   Newly available non-adenocarcinoma/small cell carcinoma PDX LuCaP lines were analyzed for expression of stem cell transcription factors (scTF) LIN28A, NANOG, POU5F1, SOX2, which are responsible for reprogramming or de-differentiation. cDNA of these genes were cloned from small cell carcinoma LuCaP 145.1 into expression vectors to determine if they could function in reprogramming.  Results:   Expression of scTF was detected in small cell carcinoma LuCaP 93, 145.1, 145.2, and non-adenocarcinoma LuCaP 173.1, 173.2A. Transfection of scTF from LuCaP 145.1 altered the gene expression of prostate non-small cell carcinoma cells, as well as fibroblasts. The resultant cells grew in stem-like colonies. Of note was a 10-fold lower expression of B2M in the transfected cells. Low B2M was also characteristic of LuCaP 145.1. Conversely, B2M was increased when stem cells were induced to differentiate.  Conclusions:   This work suggested a pathway in the emergence of non-adenocarcinoma/small cell carcinoma from adenocarcinoma through activation of scTF genes that produced cancer de-differentiation.""","""['Adelle D Kanan', 'Eva Corey', 'Ricardo Z N Vêncio', 'Arjun Ishwar', 'Alvin Y Liu']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""BMC Cancer""","""['The opposing action of stromal cell proenkephalin and stem cell transcription factors in prostate cancer differentiation.', 'Conversion of Prostate Adenocarcinoma to Small Cell Carcinoma-Like by Reprogramming.', 'Molecular characterization of prostatic small-cell neuroendocrine carcinoma.', 'Crosstalks between Raf-kinase inhibitor protein and cancer stem cell transcription factors (Oct4, KLF4, Sox2, Nanog).', 'Sox2/Oct4: A delicately balanced partnership in pluripotent stem cells and embryogenesis.', 'The opposing action of stromal cell proenkephalin and stem cell transcription factors in prostate cancer differentiation.', 'The heterogeneity of prostate cancers lacking AR activity will require diverse treatment approaches.']"""

Citrus peel extracts (CPEs) contain compounds that can potentially impair tumour growth; however the mechanism of action and effects on cell cycle regulation remain unclear. In this study, the capacity of an ethyl acetate : hexane extract (CPE/hexane) and water extract (CPE/water) to modulate the cell cycle re-entry of quiescent (PC-3 and LNCaP) prostate cancer cells was tested in an in vitro culture system. Cell cycle analysis showed that the quiescent PC-3 and LNCaP cancer cells in the presence of CPE/water were impaired in their ability to enter the S phase where only 2-3% reduction of G0/G1 cells was noted compared to 12-18% reduction of control cells. In contrast, the CPE/hexane did not show any cell cycle inhibition activity in both cell lines. A low DNA synthesis rate and weak apoptosis were observed in quiescent cancer cells treated with CPEs. Hesperidin and narirutin, the predominant flavonoids found in citrus fruits, were not responsible for the observed biological activity, implicating alternative bioactive compounds. Notably, citric acid was identified as one of the compounds present in CPEs that acts as a cell cycle re-entry inhibitor. Citric acid exhibited a higher cell toxicity effect on PC-3 prostate cancer cells than non-cancerous RWPE-1 prostate cells, suggesting specific benefits for cancer treatment.

Identification of factors that promote the expression of ectopic bone genes-process known as osteomimicry-leading to tumor progression is crucial to prevent and treat metastatic prostate cancer and prolong life expectancy for patients. Here, we identify the extracelular matrix protein mindin in the secretome of prostate adenocarcinoma cells and show that mindin overexpression in human and mouse TRAMP-C1-induced prostate tumors correlates with upregulated levels of bone-related genes in the tumorigenic prostate tissues. Moreover, mindin silencing decreased osteomimicry in adenocarcinoma cells and in the prostate tumor mice model, as well as reduced tumor cell proliferation, migration and adhesion to bone cells. Inhibition of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK 1/2) phosphorylation decreased the proliferative, migratory and pro-adhesion actions of mindin on prostate tumor cells. In addition, conditioned media obtained by crosstalk stimulation of either osteocytes or osteoblasts with the secretome of TRAMP-C1 cells promoted osteomimicry in prostate tumor cells; an effect inhibited by mindin silencing of TRAMP-C1 cells. In vivo, tibiae of primary tumor-bearing mice overexpressed the pro-angiogenic and pro-metastattic factor vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2) in a mindin-dependent manner. Our findings indicate that mindin is a novel regulator of osteomimicry in prostate tumors and potentially mediates tumor-bone cell crosstalk, suggesting its promising role as a target to inhibit bone metastases.""","""['Juan A Ardura', 'Irene Gutiérrez-Rojas', 'Luis Álvarez-Carrión', 'M Rosario Rodríguez-Ramos', 'José M Pozuelo', 'Verónica Alonso']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Carcinogenesis""","""['MINDIN Exerts Protumorigenic Actions on Primary Prostate Tumors via Downregulation of the Scaffold Protein NHERF-1.', 'MINDIN secretion by prostate tumors induces premetastatic changes in bone via β-catenin.', 'The extracellular matrix protein mindin attenuates colon cancer progression by blocking angiogenesis via Egr-1-mediated regulation.', 'Emerging Players in Prostate Cancer-Bone Niche Communication.', 'Osteomimetic properties of prostate cancer cells: a hypothesis supporting the predilection of prostate cancer metastasis and growth in the bone environment.', 'Prostate Cancer: Pathophysiology, Pathology and Therapy.', 'The multifaceted roles of the chemokines CCL2 and CXCL12 in osteophilic metastatic cancers.', 'Downregulation of Snail by DUSP1 Impairs Cell Migration and Invasion through the Inactivation of JNK and ERK and Is Useful as a Predictive Factor in the Prognosis of Prostate Cancer.', 'MINDIN Exerts Protumorigenic Actions on Primary Prostate Tumors via Downregulation of the Scaffold Protein NHERF-1.']"""

The UPR aims at restoring ER homeostasis; if the ER stress cannot be resolved, apoptosis is triggered. However, the mechanisms responsible for regulating the balance between cell life and death decisions that occur after exposure to ER stress remain unclear. Protein kinase D1 (PKD1) has been reported to initiate protective signaling against oxidative stress or ischemia, two conditions that impinge on the induction of ER stress. In addition, the high levels of expression of PKD1, observed in highly proliferative cancers and tumors with poor prognosis, contribute to enhanced resistance to chemotherapy. In this study, we show that the ER stress inducers tunicamycin and thapsigargin lead to the activation of PKD1 in human prostate cancer PC-3 cells and in hepatoma HepG2 cells through a PKCδ-dependent mechanism. Moreover, our data indicate that PKD1 is required for the stabilization of inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1) and the subsequent regulation of its activity. PKD1 activation contributes to the phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase 1, resulting in decreased IRE1-mediated c-Jun N-terminal kinase activation.

Associations between allergies and asthma and cancer risk remain unclear, and it is unknown whether associations vary by race/ethnicity.  Methods:   We evaluated these associations in the Southern Community Cohort Study. At baseline (2002-2009), 64,170 participants were queried on history of allergies and asthma; participants were followed through 2011, during which time 3,628 incident, invasive cancers were identified, including 667 lung cancers, 539 breast cancers, and 529 prostate cancers. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to estimate multivariable-adjusted HRs and 95% confidence intervals (CI).  Results:   Neither allergies nor asthma was associated with risk of developing invasive cancer overall. Asthma was associated with increased lung cancer risk (HR, 1.25; 95% CI, 1.00-1.57), with no variation by race/ethnicity (P interaction = 0.84). Conversely, history of allergies was associated with decreased lung cancer risk (HR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.65-1.00), with an inverse association observed among non-Hispanic whites (HR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.45-0.94) but not non-Hispanic blacks (HR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.73-1.25; P interaction = 0.10). No statistically significant associations were observed for risk of breast or prostate cancers, overall or by race/ethnicity.  Conclusions:   No associations were observed for risk of overall cancer, breast cancer, or prostate cancer. While asthma was associated with increased lung cancer risk, history of allergies was associated with decreased risk, an association driven by an inverse association among non-Hispanic whites.

Objective:   To compare the diagnostic performance of monoplanar (""fast"" biparametric MRI [bp-MRI]) and triplanar noncontrast bp-MRI with that of the current contrast-enhanced multiparametric MRI (mp-MRI) in the detection of high-grade PCa in biopsy-naïve men.  Design, setting, and participants:   A prospective, multireader, head-to-head study included 626 biopsy-naïve men, between February 2015 and February 2018.  Intervention:   Men underwent prebiopsy contrast-enhanced mp-MRI. Prior to biopsy, two blinded expert readers subsequently assessed ""fast"" bp-MRI, bp-MRI, and mp-MRI. Thereafter, systematic transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsies (SBs) were performed. Men with suspicious mp-MRI (Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System 3-5 lesions) also underwent MR-in-bore biopsy (MRGB).  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Primary outcome was the diagnostic performance of each protocol for the detection of high-grade PCa. Secondary outcomes included the difference in biopsy avoidance, detection of low-grade PCa, acquisition times, decision curve analyses, inter-reader agreement, and direct costs. Results from combined MRGB and SB were used as the reference standard. High-grade PCa was defined as grade ≥2.  Results and limitations:   Sensitivity for high-grade PCa for all protocols was 95% (180/190; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 91-97%). Specificity was 65% (285/436; 95% CI: 61-70%) for ""fast"" bp-MRI and 69% (299/436; 95% CI: 64-73%) for bp-MRI and mp-MRI. With fast bp-MRI, 0.96% (6/626) more low-grade PCa was detected. Biopsy could be avoided in 47% for the fast bp-MRI and in 49% for the bp-MRI and mp-MRI protocols. Fast bp-MRI and bp-MRI can be performed in 8 and 13min, respectively, instead of 16min at lower direct costs. Inter-reader agreement was 90% for fast bp-MRI protocol and 93% for bp-MRI protocol. A main limitation is the generalizability of these results in less experienced centers.  Conclusions:   Short MRI protocols can improve prostate MRI accessibility at a lower direct cost. For fast bp-MRI, this is at the cost of ∼2% more biopsies and ∼1% more overdetection of low-grade PCa. In order to implement this technique in nonexpert, low-volume, lower-field-strength scanners, further prospective studies have to be performed.  Patient summary:   We compared the value of three different magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) protocols for the detection of prostate cancer in men with elevated prostate-specific antigen levels. Our results show that, when used in expert centers, shorter MRI protocols do not compromise the detection of harmful disease. This increases MRI capacity at lower direct costs.""","""['Marloes van der Leest', 'Bas Israël', 'Erik Bastiaan Cornel', 'Patrik Zámecnik', 'Ivo G Schoots', 'Hans van der Lelij', 'Anwar R Padhani', 'Maroeska Rovers', 'Inge van Oort', 'Michiel Sedelaar', 'Christina Hulsbergen-van de Kaa', 'Gerjon Hannink', 'Jeroen Veltman', 'Jelle Barentsz']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Eur Urol""","""[""Let's Keep It at One Step at a Time: Why Biparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging Is Not the Priority Today."", ""Reply to Jochen Walz.

We investigated the role of multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging of the prostate (mpMRI) as a tool to exclude incidental prostate cancer (iPCa) and to compare mpMRI alone with a contextual transrectal ultrasound guided biopsy (TRUS-GB).  Methods:   Retrospective multicentric evaluation of 244 patients underwent to HoLEP with a suspicion of prostate cancer (PCa) due to raised PSA and/or abnormal digital rectal examination (DRE) and a negative mpMRI (PI-RADS score <3), was performed. Of these, 118 patients had only a negative mpMRI (MRI group) while 126 had a negative mpMRI and a contextual preoperative negative TRUS-GB (MRI + TRUS-GB group). Comparison between the two groups, univariate and multivariate analysis were conducted in order to identify any predictive factors of iPCa.  Results:   Median age, PSA, prostate volume and PSA density were 64.0 years (IQR: 58.0-69.0), 6.10 ng/mL (IQR: 4.76-9.65), 86.0 cc (IQR: 65.0-115.0), 50.0 cc (IQR: 37.5-80.0) and 0.08 ng/mL/cc (IQR: 0.06-0.10), respectively. In surgical specimen, iPCa was detected in 21 cases (8.8%). No statistically differences between MRI and MRI + TRUS-GB group were found in terms of iPCa (7.6% and 8.5%, respectively), pathological T stage and ISUP Grade Group.

In other cases, prior to diagnostics there may already be a suspicion that there will be no feasible oncologic treatment options. From the perspective of advance care planning and symptomatic treatment, it can nonetheless still be useful to confirm the presence of a malignancy through imaging diagnostics.

The abnormally expressed special AT-rich sequence binding protein 1 (SATB1), a nuclear matrix attachment region binding protein, in various tumors, promotes the growth and metastasis of tumor cells by regulating gene expression. In this paper, a CTC detection system for prostate cancer (PCa) was developed on the basis of epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM)-targeted immunomagnetic separation and CK-FITC and SATB-1-APC immunofluorescence assay, and the recovery rate of tumor cells in PBS and simulated whole blood by this system was detected. Subsequently, we isolated, identified, and counted SATB-1 ositive CTCs in the peripheral blood and urine samples of 60 tumor-bearing nude mice, 5 healthy volunteers and 13 PCa patients. Combined with the clinicopathological factors, the clinical value of the system was analyzed, and the possibility of SATB-1-positive CTCs in the diagnosis of PCa was evaluated. The results showed that the CTC sorting and identification system for prostate cancer constructed in this study had a recovery rate of more than 85% for CTC in PBS, urine and blood simulation samples. The expression level of SATB-1 was different in different PCa cell lines, which was relatively high in the highly invasive PCa DU-145 cell line. The expression of SATB-1 in CTCs in the blood samples of PCa patients with different clinical characteristics and in the urine samples of a few PCa patients with bone metastases were different, and the detection sensitivity of peripheral blood was higher than that of urine. This study has important clinical reference value for the early diagnosis of PCa and the evaluation of bone metastasis based on the CTC counting and the SATB-1 expression in CTCs.""","""['Chengsong Cao', 'Qun Wang', 'Qing Li', 'Qingqing Zhao', 'Jun Qi Wang', 'Yong Liu']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""J Biomed Nanotechnol""","""['Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition leads to disease-stage differences in circulating tumor cell detection and metastasis in pre-clinical models of prostate cancer.', 'Optimization and Evaluation of a Novel Size Based Circulating Tumor Cell Isolation System.', 'Analogous detection of circulating tumor cells using the AccuCyte® -CyteFinder® system and ISET system in patients with locally advanced and metastatic prostate cancer.', 'Circulating tumor cells in the diagnosis and treatment of early and advanced prostate cancer.', 'Current and future role of circulating tumor cells in patients with epithelial ovarian cancer.', 'Epigenetic Mechanisms beyond Tumour-Stroma Crosstalk.', 'The Percentage of Free PSA and Urinary Markers Distinguish Prostate Cancer from Benign Hyperplasia and Contribute to a More Accurate Indication for Prostate Biopsy.']"""

The objective of the current study is to evaluate the potential of iodine-124-labeled IPAG ([124I]IPAG) to image S1R-overexpressing tumors.  Procedures:   [124I]IPAG was synthesized from a tributyltin precursor dissolved in ethanol using chloramine-T as oxidant. Purity was analyzed using HPLC. In vitro and in vivo studies were performed using the breast cancer cell line MCF-7. Competitive inhibition studies were performed using haloperidol and cold IPAG. Tumors were established in athymic nude mice by injecting 107 cells subcutaneously. Mice were imaged on micro-positron emission tomography (PET) at 4, 24, 48, 72, and 144 h post i.v. injection. Biodistribution studies were performed at same time points. In vivo tracer dilution studies were performed using excess of IPAG and haloperidol. The efficacy of [124I]IPAG to image tumors was evaluated in LNCaP tumor-bearing mice as well.  Results:   [124I]IPAG was synthesized in quantitative yield and in vitro studies indicated that [124I]IPAG binding was specific to S1R. PET imaging studies in MCF7 tumor-bearing mice reveal that [124I]IPAG accumulates in tumor and is preferentially retained while clearing from non-target organs. The tumor to background increases with time, and tumors could be clearly visualized starting from 24 h post administration. Similar results were obtained in mice bearing LNCaP tumors. In vivo tracer dilution studies showed that the uptake of [124I]IPAG could be competitively inhibited by excess of IPAG and haloperidol.  Conclusions:   [124I]IPAG was synthesized successfully in high yields, and in vitro and in vivo studies demonstrate specificity of [124I]IPAG. [124I]IPAG shows specific accumulation in tumors with increasing tumor to background ratio at later time points and therefore has high potential for imaging S1R-overexpressing cancers.""","""['Kishore K Gangangari', 'András Váradi', 'Susruta Majumdar', 'Steven M Larson', 'Gavril W Pasternak', 'NagaVara Kishore Pillarsetty']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Mol Imaging Biol""","""['Synthesis, in vitro binding, and tissue distribution of radioiodinated 2-125IN-(N-benzylpiperidin-4-yl)-2-iodo benzamide, 2-125IBP: a potential sigma receptor marker for human prostate tumors.', 'Radioiodination and preclinical evaluation of 4-benzyl-1-(3-125I-iodobenzylsulfonyl)piperidine as a breast tumor imaging tracer in mouse.', 'Evaluation of 18F-IAM6067 as a sigma-1 receptor PET tracer for neurodegeneration in vivo in rodents and in human tissue.', 'Development of molecular probes for imaging sigma-2 receptors in vitro and in vivo.', 'Advances with the discovery and development of novel sigma 1 receptor antagonists for the management of pain.', 'Development of tumor-targeting aza-vesamicol derivatives with high affinity for sigma receptors for cancer theranostics.', 'Rapid detection of SARS-CoV-2 using a radiolabeled antibody.', 'In vitro and in vivo sigma 1 receptor imaging studies in different disease states.', 'Preclinical Advances in Theranostics for the Different Molecular Subtypes of Breast Cancer.', 'Small-Molecule Modulators of Sigma1 and Sigma2/TMEM97 in the Context of Cancer: Foundational Concepts and Emerging Themes.']"""

Voltage gated K+ (KV) channel in the plasma membrane contributes to wide range of cellular processes including cancer progression. Therefore, modulation of KV channel is being considered as a novel potential target for cancer therapy. The whole cell patch clamp technique was used to record the modulatory effect of chrysin, naringenin, caffeic acid, gallic acid, and zingerone on delayed rectifier potassium current (IK) in human prostate cancer cells LNCaP and PC-3. Among the tested compounds, zingerone blocked IK in a concentration-dependent manner in LNCaP cells and estimated the IC50 value of 141 μM and Emax was 81.3%. Further analysis of KV channel activation kinetics showed that zingerone induces a positive shift in the activation curve in LNCaP cells, whereas the inhibitory effect of gallic acid on IK was significantly less potent than the inhibition caused by zingerone. However, chrysin, naringenin, and caffeic acid did not modulate the KV channel conductance in LNCaP or PC-3 cells. Our findings confirmed that not all the tested phytochemicals to be effective modulators of IK and suggested that IK inhibitory effect of zingerone and gallic acid may be responsible for their anticancer effects in prostate cancer cells.""","""['Kiran George', 'Nisha Susan Thomas', 'Raman Malathi']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""J Membr Biol""","""['Piperine blocks voltage gated K+ current and inhibits proliferation in androgen sensitive and insensitive human prostate cancer cell lines.', 'Potential of piperine in modulation of voltage-gated K+ current and its influences on cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in human prostate cancer cells.', ""4,4'-Diisothiocyanatostilbene-2,2'-disulfonate modulates voltage-gated K+ current and influences cell cycle arrest in androgen sensitive and insensitive human prostate cancer cell lines."", 'The Ca2+-activated K+ channel of intermediate conductance:a possible target for immune suppression.', 'Gallic Acid: A Dietary Polyphenol that Exhibits Anti-neoplastic Activities by Modulating Multiple Oncogenic Targets.', 'Zingerone Modulates Neuronal Voltage-Gated Na+ and L-Type Ca2+ Currents.', 'Zingerone Targets Status Epilepticus by Blocking Hippocampal Neurodegeneration via Regulation of Redox Imbalance, Inflammation and Apoptosis.']"""

Objective:   We sought to define the transcriptomic and clinical implications of neuropeptide Y (NPY) expression in prostate cancer progression.  Design, setting, and participants:   Genome-wide expression profiling of three localized prostate cancer (total n=18818) and five metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC; total n=495) cohorts was used to characterize NPY expression. All men underwent radical prostatectomy (RP) for localized prostate cancer.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Patients were grouped into those with low NPY and high NPY based on NPY expression. Associations between these groups and histological, genomic, and clinical outcomes including progression-free survival (PFS) and metastases-free survival (MFS) were examined. Combining ERG-fusion status with NPY expression, four groups were defined (lowNPY/ERG+, lowNPY/ERG-, highNPY/ERG+, and highNPY/ERG-). Cox proportional hazards modeled the time to distant metastasis after RP. Genomic risk scores for metastasis were calculated for prospective samples, based on a 22-gene signature.  Results and limitations:   Across cancers, NPY showed the highest expression in prostate cancer in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) PAN-Cancer cohort (n=9483, p<0.0001). In 17967 prospective samples, low NPY expression was associated with aggressive grade group 5 disease and a higher genomic risk (p<0.0001). In the retrospective (n=355) and TCGA (n=497) cohorts, low NPY was associated with shorter MFS and PFS, respectively (p=0.001 for both). In mCRPC cohorts, low NPY was associated with neuroendocrine development (p<0.01). NPY was highly correlated to ERG; thus, we defined four groups based on NPY expression and ERG fusion. The lowNPY/ERG+ subtype was associated with the highest genomic risk for metastasis (p<0.0001) and the highest rate of metastasis compared with all other subtypes (hazard ratio [HR]: 2.2 [1.22-4.03], p=0.008), while the highNPY/ERG- subtype was associated with the lowest genomic risk for metastasis (p<0.0001) and the lowest rate of metastasis (HR: 0.53 [0.35-0.81], p=0.003).  Conclusions:   Low NPY expression is associated with adverse genomic features and clinical correlates and outcomes. The lowNPY/ERG+ subtype was associated with the highest risk of developing metastasis. Prognostic subgrouping and tailored treatments by NPY expression and ERG fusion status warrant further study.

Prevalence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is raising in BB due to their advancing age and prolonged HCV infection. We evaluated inpatient hospitalization and mortality in BB associated with HCC.  Materials and methods:   It is a retrospective cohort study utilizing the Healthcare Utilization Project-National Inpatient Sample (HCUP-NIS) database. From 2003 to 2012, top five primary cancer related hospitalization and mortality among BB were studied.  Results:   Among 48,733 hospitalizations related to HCC in HCUP-NIS database from 2003 to 2012, BB accounted for 49.6% (24,210) whereas non-BB 50.4% (24,523). Within BB cohort, the top five cancers with the highest proportion of hospitalizations were HCC (46%), prostate (43%), kidney (41%), pancreas (33%), and bladder (21%). From 2003 to 2012, the proportion of HCC related hospitalizations represented by BB almost doubled (33.5 to 57.8%) whereas there was one-third reduction (66.4 to 42.1%) among non-BB. Similarly, HCC-related inpatient mortality in BB decreased by 28% (6.1 to 2.7 per 100,000 hospitalization) but it remained unchanged in non-BB (11.1 to 10.6). HCC accounted for 2nd highest mortality (4960 total deaths) among hospitalized BB behind pancreatic cancer. HCC related to HCV was disproportionately higher in BB compared to non-BB (50.6% vs. 19%; P<0.001).  Conclusion:   HCC ranks number one among the top five cancers with highest proportion of inpatient burden.

At baseline and 5 time-points after radiotherapy, we assessed patients' QOL using the 26-item edition of the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index-Composite (EPIC-26) Chinese version. Logistic regression was performed to identify clinical factors associated with acute genitourinary (GU) toxicity and relative QOL.  Results:   By the end of CIRT, urinary irritation/obstruction temporarily declined (- 7.92 ± 1.76, p < .001). For urinary incontinence, bowel and sexual QOL, the scores remained stable at 2-year follow-up. The occurrences of acute Grade 1 and 2 GU toxicity were 20.3 and 10.9%, respectively, and of late Grade 1 and 2 GU toxicity were 3.1 and 1.6%, respectively. No acute or late gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity occurred. Transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) was a risk factor that predicted a decline in urinary related QOL, and age made a difference to bowel-related QOL. For sexual QOL, castration status was a remarkable risk factor. An international prostate symptom score (IPSS) ≥8 increased the risk of Grade 1-2 acute GU toxicity 5.3-fold.  Conclusion:   Patients with prostate cancer had favorable QOL after CIRT. IPSS ≥8 was a risk factor to acute GU toxicity, and TURP predicted a decline in urinary QOL.

Together with environmental contributions, genetics is a significant risk factor for high-risk prostate cancer, defined by a pathological Gleason score ≥ 8.  Methods:   Using genotype array data merged with ancestry informative reference data, we investigate the contribution of African ancestral fractions to high-risk prostate cancer. Our study includes 152 South African men of African (Black) or African-admixed (Coloured) ancestries, in which 40% showed high-risk prostate cancer.  Results:   Genetic fractions were determined for averaging an equal African to non-African genetic ancestral contribution in the Coloured; we found African ancestry to be linked to high-risk prostate cancer (P-value = 0.0477). Adjusting for age, the associated African ancestral fraction was driven by a significant KhoeSan over Bantu contribution, defined by Gleason score ≥ 8 (P-value = 0.02329) or prostate specific antigen levels ≥20 ng/ml (P-value = 0.03713). Additionally, we observed the mean overall KhoeSan contribution to be increased in Black patients with high-risk (11.8%) over low-risk (10.9%) disease. Linking for the first time KhoeSan ancestry to a common modern disease, namely high-risk prostate cancer, we tested in this small study the validity of using KhoeSan ancestry as a surrogate for identifying potential high-risk prostate cancer risk loci. As such, we identified four loci within chromosomal regions 2p11.2, 3p14, 8q23 and 22q13.2 (P-value = all age-adjusted < 0.01), two of which have previously been associated with high-risk prostate cancer.  Conclusions:   Our study suggests that ancient KhoeSan ancestry may be linked to common modern diseases, specifically those of late onset and therefore unlikely to have undergone exclusive selective pressure. As such we show within a uniquely admixed South African population a link between KhoeSan ancestry and high-risk prostate cancer, which may explain the 2-fold increase in presentation in Black South Africans compared with African Americans.""","""['Desiree C Petersen', 'Weerachai Jaratlerdsiri', 'Abraham van Wyk', 'Eva K F Chan', 'Pedro Fernandez', 'Ruth J Lyons', 'Shingai B A Mutambirw', 'Andre van der Merwe', 'Philip A Venter', 'William Bates', 'M S Riana Bornman', 'Vanessa M Hayes']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""BMC Med Genomics""","""['Complex patterns of genomic admixture within southern Africa.', 'Genetic heritage of the Baphuthi highlights an over-ethnicized notion of ""Bushman"" in the Maloti-Drakensberg, southern Africa.', 'Complex Ancient Genetic Structure and Cultural Transitions in Southern African Populations.', 'Overview of prostate cancer in indigenous black Africans and blacks of African ancestry in diaspora 1935-2007.', 'Population structure and infectious disease risk in southern Africa.', 'Whole-exome Sequencing of Nigerian Prostate Tumors from the Prostate Cancer Transatlantic Consortium (CaPTC) Reveals DNA Repair Genes Associated with African Ancestry.', 'Review of prostate cancer genomic studies in Africa.', 'Race and prostate cancer: genomic landscape.', 'Prostate Cancer Genomics Research Disparities in Africa: Advancing Knowledge in Resource Constrained Settings.', 'Psychosocial Stress, Glucocorticoid Signaling, and Prostate Cancer Health Disparities in African American Men.']"""

Methods:   From November 2014 to March 2018, preoperative TT and PSA were measured in 601 consecutive patients who were not under androgen deprivation and undergoing surgery for PCA. Patients were classified into low (ISUP 1; reference group), intermediate (ISUP 2/3), and high (ISUP 4/5) tumor grade groups.

This study compared the toxicity of intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) to the prostate and the pelvic lymph nodes (PPLN-IMRT) with prostate-only IMRT (PO-IMRT).  Materials and methods:   Patients with high-risk localized or locally advanced prostate cancer treated with IMRT in the English National Health Service between 2010 and 2013 were identified by using data from the Cancer Registry, the National Radiotherapy Dataset, and Hospital Episode Statistics, an administrative database of all hospital admissions. Follow-up was available up to December 31, 2015. Validated indicators were used to identify patients with severe toxicity according to the presence of both a procedure code and diagnostic code in patient Hospital Episode Statistics records. A competing risks regression analysis, with adjustment for patient and tumor characteristics, estimated subdistribution hazard ratios (sHRs) by comparing GI and genitourinary (GU) complications for PPLN-IMRT versus PO-IMRT.  Results:   Three-year cumulative incidence in the PPLN-IMRT (n = 780) and PO-IMRT (n = 3,065) groups was 14% for both groups for GI toxicity, and 9% and 8% for GU toxicity, respectively. Patients receiving PPLN-IMRT and PO-IMRT had similar levels of severe GI (adjusted sHR, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.80 to 1.24; P = .97) and GU (adjusted sHR, 1.10; 95% CI, 0.83 to 1.46; P = .50) toxicity rates.  Conclusion:   Including PLNs in radiation fields for high-risk or locally advanced prostate cancer is not associated with increased GI or GU toxicity at 3 years. Additional follow-up is required to answer questions about its impact on late GU toxicity. Results from ongoing trials will provide insight into the anticancer effectiveness of PLN irradiation.""","""['Matthew G Parry', 'Arunan Sujenthiran', 'Thomas E Cowling', 'Julie Nossiter', 'Paul Cathcart', 'Noel W Clarke', 'Heather Payne', 'Jan van der Meulen', 'Ajay Aggarwal']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""J Clin Oncol""","""['Toxicity of pelvic nodal radiation for localized prostate cancer.', 'Treatment-related toxicity using prostate bed versus prostate bed and pelvic lymph node radiation therapy following radical prostatectomy: A national population-based study.', 'National Population-Based Study Comparing Treatment-Related Toxicity in Men Who Received Intensity Modulated Versus 3-Dimensional Conformal Radical Radiation Therapy for Prostate Cancer.', 'Toxicity of Pelvic Lymph Node Irradiation With Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy for High-Risk and Locally Advanced Prostate Cancer: A National Population-Based Study Using Patient-Reported Outcomes.', 'Toxicity and Patient-Reported Outcomes of a Phase 2 Randomized Trial of Prostate and Pelvic Lymph Node Versus Prostate only Radiotherapy in Advanced Localised Prostate Cancer (PIVOTAL).', 'Intensity-modulated radiotherapy for the treatment of prostate cancer: a systematic review and economic evaluation.', 'Treatment-related toxicity using prostate bed versus prostate bed and pelvic lymph node radiation therapy following radical prostatectomy: A national population-based study.', 'The cost of elective nodal coverage in prostate cancer: Late quality of life outcomes and dosimetric analysis with 0, 45 or 54\xa0Gy to the pelvis.', 'Comparison of Estimated Late Toxicities between IMPT and IMRT Based on Multivariable NTCP Models for High-Risk Prostate Cancers Treated with Pelvic Nodal Radiation.', 'Implementation of patient-reported outcome measures into health care for men with localized prostate cancer.', 'Germline variants disrupting microRNAs predict long-term genitourinary toxicity after prostate cancer radiation.']"""

The widespread introduction into the clinical practice of test for prostate specific antigen (PSA) led to an increase in the number of prostate biopsies performed. At the same time, a decrease in the threshold of age-specific PSA standards has resulted in an increase in the number of unnecessary biopsies. In this regard, a need has arisen for new prostate cancer biomarkers. PCA3 is a non-coding mRNA that is exclusively expressed by prostate cells. Currently, three generations of test diagnostic systems based on the quantitative analysis of the PCA3 mRNA in the urine or its cell sediment has already developed, and they differ in the type of material studied and the method for estimating the amount of PCA3 mRNA. Clinical studies of the developed test systems have shown that a high level of PCA3 expression in the patients urine correlates with the probability of detecting prostate cancer. PCA3 test has higher positive and negative predictive values than previously used PSA test. These data are repeatedly confirmed by studies conducted in different clinics. Thus, the introduction of the method of quantitative determination of PCA3 in clinical practice can significantly improve the efficiency of diagnosis of prostate cancer and reduce the number of unnecessary biopsies.""","""['A N Toropovsky', 'A G Nikitin', 'O N Pavlova', 'D A Viktorov']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Urologiia""","""['The diagnostic value of PCA3 gene-based analysis of urine sediments after digital rectal examination for prostate cancer in a Chinese population.', 'Progensa™ PCA3 test for prostate cancer.', 'Multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging of the prostate can improve the predictive value of the urinary prostate cancer antigen 3 test in patients with elevated prostate-specific antigen levels and a previous negative biopsy.', 'The novel prostate cancer antigen 3 (PCA3) biomarker.', 'Contemporary role of prostate cancer antigen 3 in the management of prostate cancer.']"""

The overall aim of this study was therefore to explore molecular variability in PC bone metastases of potential importance for therapy. Specifically, genome-wide expression profiles of bone metastases from untreated patients (n = 12) and patients treated with androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT, n = 60) were analyzed in relation to patient outcome and to morphological characteristics in metastases and paired primary tumors. Principal component analysis and unsupervised classification were used to identify sample clusters based on mRNA profiles. Clusters were characterized by gene set enrichment analysis and related to histological and clinical parameters using univariate and multivariate statistics. Selected proteins were analyzed by immunohistochemistry in metastases and matched primary tumors (n = 52) and in transurethral resected prostate (TUR-P) tissue of a separate cohort (n = 59). Three molecular subtypes of bone metastases (MetA-C) characterized by differences in gene expression pattern, morphology, and clinical behavior were identified. MetA (71% of the cases) showed increased expression of androgen receptor-regulated genes, including prostate-specific antigen (PSA), and glandular structures indicating a luminal cell phenotype. MetB (17%) showed expression profiles related to cell cycle activity and DNA damage, and a pronounced cellular atypia. MetC (12%) exhibited enriched stroma-epithelial cell interactions. MetB patients had the lowest serum PSA levels and the poorest prognosis after ADT. Combined analysis of PSA and Ki67 immunoreactivity (proliferation) in bone metastases, paired primary tumors, and TUR-P samples was able to differentiate MetA-like (high PSA, low Ki67) from MetB-like (low PSA, high Ki67) tumors and demonstrate their different prognosis. In conclusion, bone metastases from PC patients are separated based on gene expression profiles into molecular subtypes with different morphology, biology, and clinical outcome.

In 2014, the BRFSS began offering a module to capture transgender and gender nonconforming identity. Although the BRFSS provides much needed data on the this population, these respondents are vulnerable to misclassification of sex assigned at birth.  Methods:   We applied quantitative bias analysis to explore the magnitude and direction of the systematic bias present as a result of this misclassification. We use multivariate Poisson regression with robust standard errors to estimate the association between gender and four sex-specific outcomes: prostate-specific antigen testing, Pap testing, hysterectomy, and pregnancy. We applied single and multiple imputation methods, and probabilistic adjustments to explore bias present in these estimates.  Results:   Combined BRFSS data from 2014, 2015, and 2016 included 1078 transgender women, 701 transgender men, and 450 gender nonconforming individuals. Sex assigned at birth was misclassified among 29.6% of transgender women and 30.2% of transgender men. Transgender and gender nonconforming individuals excluded due to sex-based skip patterns are demographically distinct from those who were asked reproductive health questions, suggesting that there is noteworthy selection bias present in the data. Estimates for gender nonconforming respondents are vulnerable to small degrees of bias, while estimates for cancer screenings among transgender women and men are more robust to moderate degrees of bias.  Conclusion:   Our results demonstrate that the BRFSS methodology introduces substantial uncertainty into reproductive health measures, which could bias population-based estimates. These findings emphasize the importance of implementing validated sex and gender questions in health surveillance surveys.

Results Thirty men were included (median age, 65.5 years); mean PSA level was 8.65 ng/mL and mean tumor size was 13.5 mm. One grade III adverse event (urethral stricture) was recorded. The proportion of men with erection sufficient for penetration was 83.3% (25 of 30) at baseline and 79.3% (23 of 29; P > .99) at 12 months. Leak-free and pad-free continence rate was 90% (27 of 30) at baseline and 86.2% (25 of 29; P > .99) at 12 months. Urogenital function remained stable at 12 months according to changes in the modified International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire Male Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms, or ICIQ-MLUTS, and the International Index of Erectile Function, or IIEF-5, questionnaires (P = .58 and P = .07, respectively). PSA level decreased from a baseline median value of 8.65 ng/mL (interquartile range, 5-11.4 ng/mL) to 2.35 ng/mL (interquartile range, 1-3.4 ng/mL) at 12 months (P < .001). At 6 months, 28 of 30 participants underwent posttreatment biopsy. The rate of in-field treatment failure was 17.9% (five of 28) as determined with multiparametric prostate MRI and targeted biopsies at 6 months. Conclusion After a median follow-up of 20 months, focal irreversible electroporation of localized prostate cancer was associated with low urogenital toxicity and promising oncologic outcomes. © RSNA, 2019 Online supplemental material is available for this article.""","""['Federico Collettini', 'Judith Enders', 'Carsten Stephan', 'Thomas Fischer', 'Alexander D J Baur', 'Tobias Penzkofer', 'Jonas Busch', 'Bernd Hamm', 'Bernhard Gebauer']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Radiology""","""['Nanoknife Electroporation Ablation Trial: A Prospective Development Study Investigating Focal Irreversible Electroporation for Localized Prostate Cancer.', 'Focal Therapy for Prostate Cancer with In-Bore MR-guided Focused Ultrasound: Two-Year Follow-up of a Phase I Trial-Complications and Functional Outcomes.', 'Feasibility and safety of focal irreversible electroporation as salvage treatment for localized radio-recurrent prostate cancer.', 'Irreversible electroporation (IRE): a narrative review of the development of IRE from the laboratory to a prostate cancer treatment.', 'Irreversible Electroporation for the Ablation of Prostate Cancer.', 'Pulsed Electric Fields in Oncology: A Snapshot of Current Clinical Practices and Research Directions from the 4th World Congress of Electroporation.', 'Irreversible electroporation for prostate cancer using PSMA PET-CT.', 'Image-guided stent-directed irreversible electroporation for circumferential ablation in the rat esophagus.', 'Boosting the Immune Response-Combining Local and Immune Therapy for Prostate Cancer Treatment.', 'The Safety and Efficacy of Nanosecond Pulsed Electric Field in Patients With Hepatocellular Carcinoma: A Prospective Phase 1 Clinical Study Protocol.']"""

Methods:   We measured the longitudinal stability of 673 miRNAs by collecting serial urine samples from 10 patients with localized prostate cancer. We then measured temporally stable miRNAs in an independent training cohort (n = 99) and created a biomarker predictive of Gleason grade using machine-learning techniques. Finally, we validated this biomarker in an independent validation cohort (n = 40).  Results:   We found that each individual has a specific urine miRNA fingerprint. These fingerprints are temporally stable and associated with specific biological functions. We identified seven miRNAs that were stable over time within individual patients and integrated them with machine-learning techniques to create a novel biomarker for prostate cancer that overcomes interindividual variability. Our urine biomarker robustly identified high-risk patients and achieved similar accuracy as tissue-based prognostic markers (area under the receiver operating characteristic = 0.72, 95% confidence interval = 0.69 to 0.76 in the training cohort, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.74, 95% confidence interval = 0.55 to 0.92 in the validation cohort).

Methods:   In total, 216 patients from May 2018 to November 2018 were randomly assigned to the experimental group and the control group at a ratio of 1:1. The experimental group received a periprostatic nerve block combined with subcutaneous perineal anaesthesia and intrarectal lidocaine gel. The control group received total intravenous anaesthesia. A visual analogue scale (VAS) score (0-10) was used to evaluate pain at different stages. The operative time, duration of hospitalisation, intraoperative vital signs, perioperative complications and clinicopathological features were recorded.  Results:   The overall detection rate of prostate cancer was 40.74%, and the median Gleason score was 8 for all patients diagnosed with prostate cancer. No significant differences in terms of detection rates, Gleason scores and ISUP/WHO Grade Groups were found between the two groups (P > 0.05). The experimental group had no pain or just met the criteria for mild pain during the biopsy, which was significantly alleviated after the biopsy, and had a shorter operation time compared with that of the control group (P < 0.05). Compared with the control group, the experimental group had more stable haemodynamics and respiratory status and fewer surgical complications (P < 0.05).

Desorption electrospray ionization coupled to mass spectrometry imaging (DESI-MSI) has been proposed as a potential adjunct to diagnostic surgical pathology, particularly for prostate cancer. However, due to low resolution sampling, small numbers of mass spectra, and little validation, published studies have yet to test whether this method is sufficiently robust to merit clinical translation. We used over 900 spatially resolved DESI-MSI spectra to establish an accurate, high-resolution metabolic profile of prostate cancer. We identified 25 differentially abundant metabolites, with cancer tissue showing increased fatty acids (FAs) and phospholipids, along with utilization of the Krebs cycle, and benign tissue showing increased levels of lyso-phosphatidylethanolamine (PE). Additionally, we identified, for the first time, two lyso-PEs with abundance that decreased with cancer grade and two phosphatidylcholines (PChs) with increased abundance with increasing cancer grade. Importantly, we developed and internally validated a multivariate metabolomic classifier for prostate cancer using 534 spatial regions of interest (ROIs) in the training cohort and 430 ROIs in the test cohort. With excellent statistical power, the training cohort achieved a balanced accuracy of 97% and validation on testing data set demonstrated 85% balanced accuracy. Given the validated accuracy of this classifier and the correlation of differentially abundant metabolites with established patterns of prostate cancer cell metabolism, we conclude that DESI-MSI is an effective tool for characterizing prostate cancer metabolism with the potential for clinical translation.""","""['Nicole Morse', 'Tamara Jamaspishvili', 'David Simon', 'Palak G Patel', 'Kevin Yi Mi Ren', 'Jenny Wang', 'Richard Oleschuk', 'Martin Kaufmann', 'Robert J Gooding', 'David M Berman']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Lab Invest""","""['Prostate cancer diagnosis and characterization with mass spectrometry imaging.', 'Diagnosis of prostate cancer by desorption electrospray ionization mass spectrometric imaging of small metabolites and lipids.', 'Spatially resolved metabolic phenotyping of breast cancer by desorption electrospray ionization mass spectrometry.', 'Differentiation of prostate cancer from normal tissue in radical prostatectomy specimens by desorption electrospray ionization and touch spray ionization mass spectrometry.', 'Translational Metabolomics of Head Injury: Exploring Dysfunctional Cerebral Metabolism with Ex Vivo NMR Spectroscopy-Based Metabolite Quantification.', 'Metabolically Active Zones Involving Fatty Acid Elongation Delineated by DESI-MSI Correlate with Pathological and Prognostic Features of Colorectal Cancer.', 'Alteration of Lipid Metabolism in Prostate Cancer: Multifaceted Oncologic Implications.', 'Multiplatform Metabolomics Studies of Human Cancers With NMR and Mass Spectrometry Imaging.', 'Unravelling Prostate Cancer Heterogeneity Using Spatial Approaches to Lipidomics and Transcriptomics.', 'Personalized Medicine for Prostate Cancer: Is Targeting Metabolism a Reality?']"""

Accordingly, transgenic mice that prostate-specifically overexpress ETV1 develop prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia. However, progression to the adenocarcinoma stage is stifled in these mice, suggesting that inhibitory pathways possibly preclude ETV1 from exerting its full oncogenic potential. Here we provide evidence that TGF-β/SMAD signaling represents such an inhibitory pathway. First, we discovered that ETV1 forms complexes with SMAD4. Second, SMAD2, SMAD3 and SMAD4 overexpression impaired ETV1's ability to stimulate gene transcription. Third, TGF-β1 inhibited ETV1-induced invasion by benign RWPE-1 prostate cells. Fourth, increased expression of SMAD3 and SMAD4 was observable in prostates of ETV1 transgenic mice. Conversely, we found that ETV1 may enhance TGF-β signaling in PC3 prostate cancer cells, revealing a different facet of the ETV1/TGF-β interplay. Altogether, these data provide more insights into the regulation and action of ETV1 and additionally suggest that TGF-β/SMAD signaling exerts its tumor suppressive activity, at least in part, by curtailing the oncogenic potential of ETV1 in prostatic lesions.""","""['Sangphil Oh', 'Sook Shin', 'Hoogeun Song', 'Joseph P Grande', 'Ralf Janknecht']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Sci Rep""","""['Induction of prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia and modulation of androgen receptor by ETS variant 1/ETS-related protein 81.', 'Interaction of the Androgen Receptor, ETV1, and PTEN Pathways in Mouse Prostate Varies with Pathological Stage and Predicts Cancer Progression.', '14-3-3 proteins modulate the ETS transcription factor ETV1 in prostate cancer.', 'Central role of dysregulation of TGF-β/Smad in CKD progression and potential targets of its treatment.', 'TGF-beta/Smad in prostate cancer: an update.', 'Promotion of colorectal cancer by transcription factor BHLHE40 involves upregulation of ADAM19 and KLF7.', 'Structural variation and eQTL analysis in two experimental populations of chickens divergently selected for feather-pecking behavior.', 'Sumoylation of transcription factor ETV1 modulates its oncogenic potential in prostate cancer.', 'Cooperation between ETS transcription factor ETV1 and histone demethylase JMJD1A in colorectal cancer.', 'Multivalent and Bidirectional Binding of Transcriptional Transactivation Domains to the MED25 Coactivator.']"""

Methods:   Data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), 2001-2010, were used. Males ages ≥40 years without a prostate cancer diagnosis and who had serum PSA, liver enzymes, albumin, and platelet counts measured as part of NHANES protocol were included. Liver fibrosis was measured using three scores: aspartate aminotransferase to platelet ratio index (APRI), fibrosis 4 index (FIB-4), and NAFLD fibrosis score (NFS). We assessed overall and race/ethnicity-stratified geometric mean PSA by fibrosis score using predictive margins by linear regression, and the association of abnormal fibrosis scores (APRI > 1, FIB-4 > 2.67, NFS > 0.676) and elevated PSA (>4 ng/mL) by logistic regression.

The biomolecules present in RR-AuNP and its topographical structure were detected using FTIR, SAED and AFM analysis. MTT assay was performed to detect the IC50 dose of RR-AuNP and its apoptotic effect was assessed by detecting the caspases activation, ROS generation. The anticancer effect of RR-AuNP was confirmed by DAPI staining, TUNEL assay and its molecular mechanism were confirmed by assessing the apoptotic signalling molecules protein expression. Our results illustrate that RR-AuNP showed a strong absorption peak at 550 nm and the RRAuNP were polydispersed nanospheres with size of 130 nm.

They express genes maintaining hematopoietic stem cell (HMC) niche identity and, transplanted in immunocompromised mice, organize the hematopoietic microenvironment (HME) generating humanized bone/BM ossicles. To create a mouse model of hematogenous metastasis of human prostate cancer (PC) cells to human bone/BM, we injected PC cells in the blood circulatory system of Severe Combined Immunodeficiency (SCID)/beige mice bearing heterotopic ossicles. Results indicate that PC cells could efficiently home to mice-implanted extraskeletal BM ossicles, but were not able to colonize mice skeletal segments. In humanized bone/BM ossicles, early foci of PC cells occupied a perisinusoidal position, in close contact with perivascular stromal cells. These findings demonstrate the importance of the SSC compartment in recreating a suitable environment to metastatic PC cells. Our data support the hypothesis that BM SSCs committed to a pericyte fate can specify for homing niches of PC cells, suggesting an involvement of specific interactions with subendothelial stromal cells in extravasation of circulating metastatic PC cells to BM.""","""['Alessia Funari', 'Maurizio Alimandi', 'Luca Pierelli', 'Valentina Pino', 'Stefano Gentileschi', 'Benedetto Sacchetti']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Cancers (Basel)""","""['Self-renewing osteoprogenitors in bone marrow sinusoids can organize a hematopoietic microenvironment.', 'Mesenchymal stem cells regulate melanoma cancer cells extravasation to bone and liver at their perivascular niche.', 'Concise Review: Conceptualizing Paralogous Stem-Cell Niches and Unfolding Bone Marrow Progenitor Cell Identities.', 'Human-derived osteoblast-like cells and pericyte-like cells induce distinct metastatic phenotypes in primary breast cancer cells.', 'Pericytes, integral components of adult hematopoietic stem cell niches.', 'Gangliosides and Their Role in Multilineage Differentiation of Mesenchymal Stem Cells.', 'Stem Cell-Induced Cell Motility: A Removable Obstacle on the Way to Safe Therapies?', 'The Breast Tumor Microenvironment: A Key Player in Metastatic Spread.', 'Low-frequency electromagnetic fields combined with tissue engineering techniques accelerate intervertebral fusion.', 'Ras and Wnt Interaction Contribute in Prostate Cancer Bone Metastasis.']"""

Full length Par-4 has been shown to be predominantly intrinsically disordered in vitro under neutral conditions. As part of the apoptotic process, cellular Par-4 is cleaved at D131 by caspase-3, which generates a 24 kDa C-terminal activated fragment (cl-Par-4) that enters the nucleus and inhibits pro-survival genes, thereby preventing cancer cell proliferation. Here, the structure of cl-Par-4 was investigated using CD spectroscopy, dynamic light scattering, intrinsic tyrosine fluorescence, and size exclusion chromatography with mutli-angle light scattering. Biophysical characterization shows that cl-Par-4 aggregates and is disordered at low ionic strength. However, with increasing ionic strength, cl-Par-4 becomes progressively more helical and less aggregated, ultimately forming largely ordered tetramers at high NaCl concentration. These results, together with previous results showing induced folding at acidic pH, suggest that the in vivo structure and self-association state of cl-Par-4 may be strongly dependent upon cellular environment.""","""['Andrea M Clark', 'Komala Ponniah', 'Meghan S Warden', 'Emily M Raitt', 'Benjamin G Smith', 'Steven M Pascal']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""FEBS J""","""['Structural Analysis of the cl-Par-4 Tumor Suppressor as a Function of Ionic Environment.', 'pH-Induced Folding of the Caspase-Cleaved Par-4 Tumor Suppressor: Evidence of Structure Outside of the Coiled Coil Domain.', 'Prostate apoptosis response 4 (Par-4), a novel substrate of caspase-3 during apoptosis activation.', 'Cancer-selective apoptosis by tumor suppressor par-4.', 'Pro-apoptosis and selective anticancer activities of prostate apoptosis response protein 4: research progress and prospects.', 'Enhancing the Conformational Stability of the cl-Par-4 Tumor Suppressor via Site-Directed Mutagenesis.', 'Structural Analysis of the cl-Par-4 Tumor Suppressor as a Function of Ionic Environment.']"""

The correlation of the pattern of nodal metastases with patient outcome has yet to be explored.  Methods and results:   Lymph node-positive prostatectomies were retrospectively reviewed. The presence of cribriform carcinoma (CC), intraductal carcinoma (IDC) and ISUP grade (G) were documented. The largest nodal metastasis was assessed for the morphological patterns present. G was assigned to the metastasis based on percentage morphological patterns present. Statistical analysis used spss to assess disease-specific survival (DSS), disease-free survival (DFS) and distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS). One hundred and ten cases were identified: G5 (n = 52), G4 (n = 8), G3 (n = 34), G2 (n = 10) and no G (n = 6; treatment effect). IDC or CC was present in 103 (94%) specimens. More than one positive node correlated with worse DFS [P = 0.012, hazard ratio (HR) = 1.951, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.142-3.331] and DMFS (P = 0.009, HR = 2.647, 95% CI = 1.239-5.651).

ETs are polyphenols that are metabolized in the gut microbiota to urolithin A (UA). p53 is a tumor suppressor that lost its activity through MDM2 activation in about half cancers. The purpose of this study was to investigate the influence of UA on the p53-MDM2 interaction pathway in prostate cancer cell lines.  Methods:   Three human prostate cancer cell lines were used that harbor different p53 genotypes; LNCaP (p53+/+), 22RV1(p53-/+) and PC3 (p53-/-). Cell viability was determined by CellTiter-Glo Luminescent assay. Apoptosis was confirmed by measuring annexin V by flow cytometry. The expression of p53, its target proteins, and apoptotic markers were measured by western blotting. Real-time qPCR was used to measure the gene expression of p21, a main target gene of p53. Co-immunoprecipitation-immunoblotting was used to assess the inhibition of interactions between p53 and MDM2 and to assess the effect of UA on MDM2-mediated p53 polyubiquitination.  Results:   We found UA inhibited CaP cells' viability and induced apoptosis. For 22RV1 and LNCaP, we found UA increased p53 protein expression and its main target protein, p21, and MDM2, forming an autoregulatory feedback loop. In addition, UA increased the p53 proapoptotic proteins PUMA and NOXA. Moreover, UA inhibited the interaction between p53 and MDM2 and inhibited MDM2-mediated p53 polyubiquitination. UA downregulated MDM2 and XIAP protein expression in PC3 cells and upregulated p21 and p14ARF in a p53-independent manner.

Rarely, meningiomas may involve the middle ear and mastoid, resulting from contiguous spread of adjacent intracranial tumor, or extremely rarely, as an isolated primary tumor, which is frequently misdiagnosed and unrecognized, resulting in inappropriate clinical management.  Case report:   Herein we report such a case of an 80-year-old man with history of multiple cancer who presented with ear pain, vertigo and hearing loss. Audiometry demonstrated bilateral sensorineural hearing loss. Contrast-enhanced temporal bone computed tomography revealed a soft-tissue mass in the right epitympanum without bone erosion or any intracranial involvement. Radiological and operative findings were suspicious for cholesteatoma. Histological examination showed an epithelial neoplasm arranged in nests and whorls with intranuclear inclusions. No psammoma bodies, mitotic figures, or tumor necrosis were identified. The tumor cells were positive for epithelial membrane antigen, vimentin, progesterone receptor and CD56; and negative for synaptophysin, chromogranin, pancytokeratin (AE1/AE3), cytokeratin 7, prostate-specific antigen, inhibin, S100, P63, and P40. Ki67 highlighted about 2% of the tumor cells. Based on the morphological features and immunohistochemical profile, the tumor was diagnosed as primary extracranial meningioma of the mastoid, meningothelial subtype, World Health Organization grade 1.

Methods:   Patients aged ≥18 years with bone metastasis from BC or PC or with MM between 2004 and 2015 were included. SRE was defined as pathologic fracture, spinal cord compression, radiation, or surgery to bone. Patients were followed-up from the initial diagnosis of bone metastasis (for those with BC or PC) or MM until SRE occurrence. To estimate multiple SREs, we applied a 21-day time window to ensure that subsequent SREs occurred independently from the previous event. We calculated the incidence and 95% confidence intervals (CIs), stratified according to the previous SRE history.  Results:   Our cohort included 53,231 patients, including 23,811 with BC, 19,170 with PC, and 10,250 with MM. The incidence of multiple SREs in the 21-day time window was 1.03 (95% CI = 1.01-1.05) in patients with previous SRE history and 0.19 (95% CI = 0.19-0.20) in those without.

Since 15-lipoxygenase (15-LOX) metabolites reduced growth of breast, colon, prostate, lung and leukemia cancer cells in 2D cell culture, we were intrigued by the direct comparison of 15-LOX metabolite efficacy in 2D and 3D culture including a stroma equivalent. Herein, we studied the effects of 15-LOX metabolites 13-HpOTrE, 13-HpODE, and 15-HpETE on cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma cells. All metabolites reduced the viability of cancer cells in 2D culture below 10% at 100 µM of each substance. 13-HpOTrE, being the most active agent with respect to cytotoxicity and apoptosis was selected for further experiments. Other than with the 2D culture, we did not obverse cell death, neither from lactate dehydrogenase release, nor from morphology when applying 13-HpOTrE onto the surface of the 3D tumor constructs for one week. Next, we investigated the protein expression of peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma, for which the ligand is 13-HpOTrE, and Bcl-2 protein, an apoptosis regulator, but did not find any change following 13-HpOTrE administration. However, 13-HpOTrE treatment reduced the release of interleukin-6, bringing it closer to the level of tumor-free constructs. In conclusion, 13-HpOTrE reduces viability of skin cancer cells in 2D cultures only but modulates inflammatory cytokine levels in the corresponding 3D tumor constructs, too. These studies highlight the need for screening of anticancer drugs employing 3D tumors and including tumor microenvironment in the screening process to increase the low success rate of clinical trials in oncology.""","""['Christopher Wolff', 'Christian Zoschke', 'Suresh Kumar Kalangi', 'Pallu Reddanna', 'Monika Schäfer-Korting']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Eur J Pharm Biopharm""","""['The 15-lipoxygenase-1 product 13-S-hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid down-regulates PPAR-delta to induce apoptosis in colorectal cancer cells.', 'Effect of 15-lipoxygenase metabolites, 15-(S)-HPETE and 15-(S)-HETE on chronic myelogenous leukemia cell line K-562: reactive oxygen species (ROS) mediate caspase-dependent apoptosis.', 'Tumor-associated down-regulation of 15-lipoxygenase-1 is reversed by celecoxib in colorectal cancer.', 'The two faces of the 15-lipoxygenase in atherosclerosis.', '5-lipoxygenase antagonist therapy: a new approach towards targeted cancer chemotherapy.', 'Ferroptosis Involvement in Glioblastoma Treatment.', 'Identifying prognostic signatures in the microenvironment of prostate cancer.', 'Involvement of parathyroid hormone-related peptide in the aggressive phenotype of colorectal cancer cells.', 'Targeting Lipid Peroxidation for Cancer Treatment.', 'How Qualification of 3D Disease Models Cuts the Gordian Knot in Preclinical Drug Development.']"""

Wnt-pathway activation may accelerate prostate cancer androgen-independent growth and mediate antiandrogen resistance. Since 10-20% of advanced prostate cancers harbor Wnt-activating mutations, we aimed to characterize the clinical features and response to novel antiandrogens in such patients.  Objective:   To determine whether men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) who harbor Wnt-pathway mutations have poorer responses to first-line novel hormonal therapies: abiraterone/enzalutamide.  Design, setting, and participants:   Patients with mCRPC who received first-line abiraterone or enzalutamide were retrospectively evaluated. Using tumor DNA analyses, we queried for activating mutations in CTNNB1 or inactivating mutations in APC or RNF43, all of which are predicted to stimulate Wnt signaling. Presence or absence of at least one Wnt-activating alteration was correlated with clinical-pathologic characteristics and treatment outcomes.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Time to prostate-specific antigen (PSA) progression, overall survival (OS), and PSA response were measured. Cox regression models were used to test associations between Wnt status and clinical-pathologic outcomes; Kaplan-Meier and log-rank analyses were used to compare time-to-event endpoints.  Results and limitations:   Of 137 patients evaluated, 11% (n=15) had tumor DNA analysis showing at least one Wnt-stimulating alteration. Patients with Wnt-activating mutations had numerically fewer T3/T4 tumors than Wnt wild-type patients (31% vs 51%), but were otherwise generally balanced. Median time to PSA progression on first-line abiraterone/enzalutamide was shorter in Wnt-activated patients (6.5 vs 9.6mo, hazard ratio [HR] 2.34, p=0.003), as was OS (23.6 vs 27.7mo, HR 2.28, p=0.01). PSA responses were numerically worse in Wnt-activated patients (53% vs 75%, p=0.12). Presence of Wnt-activating alterations (adjusted HR [aHR] 2.33, p=0.007) and use of previous chemotherapy (aHR 1.83, p=0.004) were both independently associated with increased hazard of progression.  Conclusions:   Patients with somatic Wnt-pathway activating mutations have worse outcomes to first-line abiraterone/enzalutamide than Wnt wild-type patients. Our data suggest that additional genomically informed therapies are needed for this relevant subset of mCRPC patients.  Patient summary:   In this report, we retrospectively examined outcomes of metastatic prostate cancer patients with or without Wnt-pathway mutations who received abiraterone or enzalutamide for the first time, in order to examine whether these mutations affect the prognosis. Our study suggested that patients who have Wnt-pathway activating mutations derived less benefit from abiraterone and enzalutamide when compared to patients without these mutations. We conclude that Wnt-pathway mutations might decrease the effectiveness of abiraterone and enzalutamide, and we propose that the Wnt pathway might be a good therapeutic target for these patients, in order to potentially reverse or prolong resistance to abiraterone and enzalutamide in men with Wnt mutations.""","""['Pedro Isaacsson Velho', 'Wei Fu', 'Hao Wang', 'Nooshin Mirkheshti', 'Fahad Qazi', 'Fabiola A S Lima', 'Farah Shaukat', 'Michael A Carducci', 'Samuel R Denmeade', 'Channing J Paller', 'Mark C Markowski', 'Catherine H Marshall', 'Mario A Eisenberger', 'Emmanuel S Antonarakis']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Eur Urol""","""['Characterizing the Wnt Pathway in Advanced Prostate Cancer: When, Why, and How.', 'Re: Wnt-pathway Activating Mutations Are Associated with Resistance to First-line Abiraterone and Enzalutamide in Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'AR-V7 in Peripheral Whole Blood of Patients with Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer: Association with Treatment-specific Outcome Under Abiraterone and Enzalutamide.', 'Germline DNA-repair Gene Mutations and Outcomes in Men with Metastatic Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer Receiving First-line Abiraterone and Enzalutamide.', 'Androgen Receptor Splice Variant 7 and Efficacy of Taxane Chemotherapy in Patients With Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Germline DNA-repair Gene Mutations and Efficacy of Abiraterone or Enzalutamide in Patients with Metastatic Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Understanding and overcoming the mechanisms of primary and acquired resistance to abiraterone and enzalutamide in castration resistant prostate cancer.', 'Glucocorticoid Receptor and β-Catenin Interact in Prostate Cancer Cells and Their Co-Inhibition Attenuates Tumorsphere Formation, Stemness, and Docetaxel Resistance.', 'HOXB3 drives WNT-activation associated progression in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'BHLHE22 drives the immunosuppressive bone tumor microenvironment and associated bone metastasis in prostate cancer.', 'Integrative molecular analyses define correlates of high B7-H3 expression in metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Comprehensive analysis of TP53 and SPOP mutations and their impact on survival in metastatic prostate cancer.']"""

Androgen biosynthesis inhibition in the preoperative setting may improve outcomes. In this single-centre randomised trial, we looked at therapy outcomes of preoperative treatment with abiraterone acetate+prednisone (AAP)+luteinising hormone-releasing hormone agonist (LHRHa) or LHRHa alone followed by radical prostatectomy in 65 men. We did not see a significant difference of organ-confined carcinoma (p=0.27). However, tumour volume measures were significantly lower for AAP+LHRHa treatment (p≤0.001). Of note, lower tumour epithelium volume correlated with improved biochemical recurrence-free survival at ≥4-yr follow-up (p=0.0014). Tumours pretreated with AAP+LHRHa had lower proliferation and androgen signalling expression than LHRHa. On multivariate analysis, glucocorticoid receptor (GR) overexpression correlated with persistent tumours in AAP+LHRHa (p=0.018). The presence of nuclear androgen receptor splice variant (nARV7) correlated with persistent tumours in both arms. No new safety signals were observed. This is the first study investigating the role of preoperative AAP+LHRHa versus LHRHa alone in LHRPC. We report significant cytoreduction by tumour volume measures inversely correlating with biochemical relapse. Validation of these proposed tumour volume measures is planned. A potential role of GR in resistance to androgen biosynthesis inhibition warrants further study.

However, its involvement in prostate cancer (PCa) remains unknown. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the clinical significance of HMGCS2 expression and its functions in PCa.  Methods:   Expression levels of HMGCS2 mRNA and protein were detected by quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (qPCR), Western blot and immunohistochemistry, respectively. Associations of HMGCS2 expression with various clinicopathological features and patients' prognosis of PCa were statistically evaluated. Roles of HMGCS2 dysregulation in cell proliferation, invasion and migration of PCa cell lines were also determined.  Results:   HMGCS2 protein expression was significantly reduced in PCa tissues compared to adjacent benign prostate tissues at protein levels (P < 0.05). Clinically, low HMGCS2 mRNA expression was dramatically associated with high Gleason score (GS) and pathological grade, as well as the presence of distant metastasis of PCa patients. In addition, PCa patients with low HMGCS2 mRNA expression more frequently had shorter disease-free survival and biochemical recurrence-free survival (all P < 0.05). HMGCS2 expression was identified as an independent factor to predict both disease-free and biochemical recurrence-free survivals of PCa patients. Moreover, loss-of-function experiments demonstrated that HMGCS2 knockdown-expression promotes cell proliferation, colony formation, invasion and migration of PCa cells in vitro and lower the apoptotic rate of PCa cells in vitro.  Conclusions:   Our data indicate that HMGCS2 may be capable of predicting the risk of biochemical recurrence in PCa patients after radical prostatectomy and functions as a tumor suppressor in PCa cancer, implying its related pathway potential as a drug candidate in anti-PCa therapy.""","""['Song Wan', 'Ming Xi', 'Hai-Bo Zhao', 'Wei Hua', 'Yuan-Ling Liu', 'Yu-Lin Zhou', 'Yang-Jia Zhuo', 'Ze-Zhen Liu', 'Zhi-Duan Cai', 'Yue-Ping Wan', 'Wei-De Zhong']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Pathol Res Pract""","""['Down-regulation of protein kinase, DNA-activated, catalytic polypeptide attenuates tumor progression and is an independent prognostic predictor of survival in prostate cancer.', 'Decreased Expression of MYPT1 Contributes to Tumor Angiogenesis and Poor Patient Prognosis in Human Prostate Cancer.', 'ARRDC3 Inhibits the Progression of Human Prostate Cancer Through ARRDC3-ITGβ4 Pathway.', 'Involvement of the multiple tumor suppressor genes and 12-lipoxygenase in human prostate cancer.

The agreement between planning and delivery of low-dose radiation therapy (LD-RT) was assessed with direct comparison to expected doses and tabulated total body irradiation (TBI) calculations. Studies over the past decades indicate that LD-RT has strong potential to be an effective treatment modality for cancer patients with minimal toxicities. This physics-based study aims to provide sufficient conclusions required for prospective clinical studies involving HB irradiation regimes. Specifically, this study may provide reassurance of MU calculation in the Pinnacle system for an upcoming trial regarding nontargeted LD-RT for recurrent prostate cancer.  Methods:   Water phantom: A plan was created in Pinnacle to deliver 100 cGy to a water phantom with an ion chamber mount. A percent depth dose was obtained. Electrometer readings were recorded with each irradiation of 400 MUs at varying ion chamber depths at extended distance. A percent depth dose was created from tabulated data. Anthropomorphic phantom: A parallel opposed pair plan was created in Pinnacle to deliver 150 cGy over 10 fractions to the umbilicus of the phantom at 4 m extended source-to-surface distance. The MUs required to deliver 150 cGy, as per Pinnacle were delivered to the phantom using 6 MV photons. Thermoluminescent dosimeters (TLD), used to measure exposure using light-emitting crystals, were placed along six reference locations (lung, mid-T-spine, abdomen, mid-pelvis, thigh, and mid-abdomen) on the phantom. TLD measurements were then compared with the Pinnacle-derived ROI mean doses. For experiment 2, TBI calculation factors were used to determine the required MUs to deliver 150 cGy to the prescription (Rx) point. The calculated MUs were delivered, and TLD readings were recorded to compare the level of agreement of using TBI calculations for HB treatments.  Results:   Water phantom: Pinnacle did not accurately estimate dmax at extended distance; however, it did accurately estimate the dose past dmax. Anthropomorphic phantom: A 10% variation to expected dose was deemed significant. Both Pinnacle and TBI calculations were accurate methods of planning HB LD-RT treatment, with insignificant difference. Pinnacle's overall average variation across ROIs was borderline significant at 12.1%.  Conclusion:   At extended source-to-surface distance, Pinnacle inaccurately estimated the entrance dose and dmax. Anthropomorphic phantom studies indicated borderline significant variation, as per the implemented 10% limit. TBI calculations presented similar conclusions. For purposes of HB LD-RT, a borderline 10% variation will have insignificant impact to the patient's ability to tolerate treatment.

Methods:   Ethical clearance was granted to enroll 33 patients into this study who were treated with intensity-modulated radiation therapy for prostate cancer. All patients underwent two magnetic resonance imagings before and after radiation therapy (RT). A total of 274 radiomic features were extracted from MR-T2W-weighted images.

In this study, a novel ultrasensitive FTO graphene nanosheets based electrode was used as a working probe to analyze the interaction between urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA) and monoclonal uPAR antibody (Ab). Graphene nanosheets (GNS) exhibited high conductivity, thereby increasing the sensitivity of the immunochemical assay. GNS were coupled with uPAR-Ab via carbodiimide activation chemistry with 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide (EDC)/N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) as a heterobifunctional crosslinker. The confirmation of immobilization events was done by biophysical methods such as UV-Vis spectroscopy, fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM), differential pulse (DPV), and cyclic voltammetry (CV). The immobilization conditions were optimized in accordance with the best sensor response. Under optimum conditions, the proposed sensor displayed wide linear detection range (1 fM to 1 μM) with a detection limit of 4.8 fM in standard.

Sulfonamide derivatives have shown biological activities against many human diseases, including cancer. CID-6033590, a sulfonylhydrazide compound, screened from PubChem database by molecular docking with p38αMAPK, was evaluated for anti-cancerous activities. CID-6033590 induced toxicity in both DU145 and PC-3 cells in a concentration and time-dependent manner with an IC50 value of 60 μM and 66 μM, respectively. Sub-cytotoxic concentrations of the compound significantly induced S-phase cell cycle arrest, inhibited cyclinA/CDK2 complex and blocked cell proliferation. Further, CID-6033590 downregulated phosphorylation of p38MAPK (P-p38) as well as its downstream targets, Activating transcription factor 2 (ATF-2) and Heat shock protein 27 (Hsp27). The compound increased ROS and decreased mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψm), downregulated Bcl-2 and survivin and cleaved poly ADP ribose polymerase (PARP) and caspase-3, indicating the induction of apoptosis.

Methods and materials:   Male Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to 25 Gy of 220-kV prostate-confined x-rays. Animals were randomized to receive sham radiation therapy (RT), RT alone, RT with daily BIO 300 at 2 experimental dosing regimens, or RT with daily genistein. Erectile response was evaluated over time. Penile shaft tissue was harvested for histologic analyses. Murine xenograft studies using prostate cancer cell lines determined the effects of BIO 300 dosing on RT efficacy.  Results:   Prostate-confined RT significantly decreased apomorphine-induced erectile response (P < .05 vs sham RT). Erection frequency in animals receiving prophylactic treatment with BIO 300 starting 3 days before RT was similar to sham controls after RT. Treatment with synthetic genistein did not mitigate loss in erectile frequency. At week 14, post-RT treatment with BIO 300 resulted in significantly higher quality of erectile function compared with both the RT arm and the RT arm receiving genistein starting 3 days before irradiation (P < .05). In hormone-sensitive and insensitive prostate tumor-bearing mice, BIO 300 administration did not negatively affect radiation-induced tumor growth delay.  Conclusions:   BIO 300 prevents radiation-induced ED, measured by erection frequency, erectile function, and erection quality, when administered 3 days before RT and continued daily for up to 14 weeks. Data also suggest that BIO 300 administered starting 2 hours after RT mitigates radiation-induced ED.

Methods:   We retrospectively included 91 consecutive patients who underwent prostate multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mp-MRI) and histopathological evaluation. Mp-MRI images were reported by the PI-RADSv2 scoring system and patients were divided into groups considering the likelihood of CSPCa. ADC value and ratio were obtained. Findings were correlated with histopathological data.  Results:   CSPCa was found in 41.8% of cases (n = 38). PI-RADSv2 score 3-5 yielded a sensitivity of 97.4% (95% confidence intervals 86.5-99.5), a specificity of 50.9% (37.9-63.9), and AUC of 0.74 (0.67-0.81) to predict CSPCa.

Methods and materials:   Treatment planning source positioning errors were simulated for 20 patient plans in the brachytherapy treatment planning system by manually adjusting the dwell position coordinates within selected catheters without plan reoptimization. The change in dose-volume histogram (DVH) indices was calculated as a function of the source positioning error. The magnitude of the change in the DVH indices was then used to derive appropriate in vivo source tracking error thresholds.  Results:   Source positioning error thresholds to prevent potentially significant changes in prostate (target) DVH metrics ranged from 2 to 5 mm, dependent on the direction of the source positioning error, as well as the relative weight of the dwell position within the plan, and its position relative to the patient anatomy. Source positioning error thresholds to prevent potentially clinically significant changes in organ at risk DVH metrics were found to be complex and patient-dependent.  Conclusions:   In vivo source tracking error thresholds for transrectal ultrasound-based real-time high-dose-rate prostate brachytherapy were investigated via the simulation of treatment planning source positioning errors.

Methods: Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and western blot analyses were used to detect the expression of serum FGF9 at mRNA and protein level in 90 PCa patients, 48 prostatic benign diseases (PBD) patients and 30 normal individuals. The association between FGF9 and clinicopathological features was determined by Chi-square test. Receiver-operator characteristic (ROC) was established to evaluate the diagnostic performance of FGF9 and PSA. Results: Serum FGF9 expression was significantly elevated in PCa patients (p < .001) and was obviously decreased after surgery (p < .001).

To develop this biosensing tool, triangular gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) were synthesized using Tween-20 as a nonionic surfactant and then, conjugated with PSA capture antibody (Ab1-AuNPs). When exposed to Ab1-AuNPs, PSA antigens were found to be successfully captured by nanosystem (PSA)-Ab1-AuNPs. Next, (PSA)-Ab1-AuNPs were incubated with second PSA antibody (2)-decorated magnetite (Fe3O4-Ab2) and separated by an external magnetic force to leave Ab1-AuNPs in the supernatant solution to be directly analyzed using UV-Vis spectroscopy. It was found that the absorption intensity was directly proportional to the PSA concentration. As a result, the linear range for PSA detection was found to be 0.01-20 ng mL-1 with a detection limit of 0.009 ng mL-1. Because of significant stability of the prepared Ab1-AuNPs and excellent selectivity to the PSA antigen, this simple and sensitive sensing system is proposed to be potentially effective in the fast and real-time analysis of clinical samples from prostate cancer patients.

This multidrug resistance (MDR) phenomenon results in failed therapies and poor patient prognoses. A common cause of MDR is over-expression of the P-glycoprotein (ABCB1/P-gp) transporter. We report here on an MDR modulator that is a small molecule inhibitor of P-glycoprotein, but is not a pump substrate for P-gp and we show for the first time that extended exposure of an MDR prostate cancer cell line to the inhibitor following treatment with chemotherapeutics and inhibitor resulted in trapping of the chemotherapeutics within the cancerous cells. This trapping led to decreased cell viability, survival, and motility, and increased indicators of apoptosis in the cancerous cells. In contrast, extended exposure of non-Pgp-overexpressing cells to the inhibitor during and after similar chemotherapy treatments did not lead to decreased cell viability and survival, indicating that toxicity of the chemotherapeutic was not increased by the inhibitor.

In addition, LARP4B was identified as a target gene of miR‑106b by bioinformatics prediction analysis and a dual luciferase reporter gene assay. Furthermore, MTT, wound healing and Transwell assays were performed to evaluate PCa cell viability, and migration and invasive abilities. The data revealed that inhibition of miR‑106b significantly suppressed the viability, migration and invasion of PCa cells. In addition, inhibition of miR‑106b significantly suppressed the mRNA and protein expression of cancer‑related genes, including matrix metalloproteinase‑2, cluster of differentiation 44 and Ki‑67, and increased that of the tumor suppressor, mothers against decapentaplegic homolog 2.

Standardised questionnaires that assessed family communication, family coping and psychological distress were used.  Results:   The results indicate that the relationships among variables of interests varied by the depression, anxiety and somatisation subscales of psychological distress. For example, depression was negatively associated with family communication, while somatisation was negatively associated with reframing coping. Mediating effects of family communication and family coping were observed only for the somatisation and depression subscales.  Conclusion:   Findings suggest that spouses of cancer survivors may experience different psychological distress symptoms in the survivorship period according to how well the family communicates and how it copes when facing a crisis situation.

However, placement of the robot is critical because it is radio-opaque and might severely influence the achievable dose distribution.  Methods:   We propose two heuristic optimization strategies for automatic placement of an ultrasound robot around a patient. Considering a kinematically redundant robot arm, we compare a generic approach based on stochastic search and a more problem-specific segmentwise construction approach. The former allows for multiple elbow configurations while the latter is deterministic. Additionally, we study different objective functions guiding the search. Our evaluation is based on data for ten actual prostate cancer cases and we compare the resulting plan quality for both methods to manually chosen robot configurations previously proposed.  Results:   The mean improvements in the treatment planning objective value with respect to the best manually selected robot position and a single elbow configuration range from 8.2 to 32.8% and 8.5 to 15.5% for segmentwise construction and stochastic search, respectively. Considering three different elbow configurations, the stochastic search results in better objective values in 80% of the cases, with 30% being significantly better. The optimization strategies are robust with respect to beam sampling and transducer orientation and using previous optimization results as starting point for stochastic search typically results in better solutions compared to random starting points.  Conclusion:   We propose a robust and generic optimization scheme, which can be used to optimize the robot placement for robotic ultrasound guidance in radiation therapy.

CatK is predominantly secreted by osteoclasts and specifically degrades collagen I leading to bone destruction. PCa and breast cancer preferentially metastasize to the bone. Importantly, CatK expression level is greater in PCa bone metastatic sites compared to primary tumor and normal prostate tissues. However, the underlying mechanism of CatK during PCa metastases into the bone remains to be elucidated. We investigated the functional role of CatK during the PCa establishment and growth process in the murine bone.  Methods:   CatK mRNA expression was validated by RT-PCR, protein expression by immunoblotting in PCa LNCaP, C4-2B, and PC3 cells as well as in PCa tissues. Its protein production was measured using ELISA assay. The effect of both knockdowns via siRNA and CatK inhibitor was compared in regard to PCa cell invasion. We further studied the dose-dependent CatK inhibitor effect on conditioned media-induced bone resorption. In setting up an animal model, C4-2B cells were injected into the tibiae of SCID mice. The animals treated with either vehicle or CatK inhibitor for 8 weeks at the time of tumor cell injection (tumor establishment model; protocol I) or 4 weeks after tumor cell injection (tumor progression model; protocol II) were applied to histological and histomorphometric analyses.  Results:   We confirmed CatK expression in PCa LNCaP, C4-2B, and PC3 cells as well as in PCa tissues. Furthermore, we observed the inhibitory effects of a selective CatK inhibitor on PCa cell invasion. The CatK inhibitor dose-dependently inhibited PCa-conditioned media-induced bone resorption. Upon injection of C4-2B cells into the tibiae of SCID mice, the selective CatK inhibitor significantly prevented the tumor establishment in protocol I, and reduced the tumor growth in bone in protocol II. It also decreased serum PSA levels in both animal models. The inhibitory effects of the CatK inhibitor were enhanced in combination with zoledronic acid (ZA).  Conclusion:   The selective CatK inhibitor may prevent the establishment and progression of PCa in bone, thus making it a novel therapeutic approach for advanced PCa.""","""['Weiping Liang', 'Fuhao Wang', 'Qiuyan Chen', 'Jinlu Dai', 'June Escara-Wilke', 'Evan T Keller', 'Johann Zimmermann', 'Ni Hong', 'Yi Lu', 'Jian Zhang']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""J Cancer Res Clin Oncol""","""['Efficacy of a cathepsin K inhibitor in a preclinical model for prevention and treatment of breast cancer bone metastasis.', 'A cathepsin K inhibitor reduces breast cancer induced osteolysis and skeletal tumor burden.', 'RNA interference targeting PSCA suppresses primary tumor growth and metastasis formation of human prostate cancer xenografts in SCID mice.', 'Complexity of cancer protease biology: Cathepsin K expression and function in cancer progression.', 'Pharmacological inhibition of cathepsin K: A promising novel approach for postmenopausal osteoporosis therapy.', 'Cathepsin K in Pathological Conditions and New Therapeutic and Diagnostic Perspectives.', 'Cathepsin a upregulation in glioma: A potential therapeutic target associated with immune infiltration.', 'Expression and clinical significance of Cathepsin K and MMPs in invasive non-functioning pituitary adenomas.', 'Cathepsin K: A Versatile Potential Biomarker and Therapeutic Target for Various Cancers.', 'Inflammatory endothelium-targeted and cathepsin responsive nanoparticles are effective against atherosclerosis.']"""

Barriers to widespread use are: (1) delayed or limited access to genetic counseling; (2) no insurance coverage; (3) lack of effective workflows; (4) insufficient educational materials; and (5) time and space constraints in busy clinics. The primary limitation was the <50% (19 of 43) response from PCCTC sites and no coverage of nonacademic cancer treatment facilities.

A long follow-up series""","""Introduction:   The world population is ageing, and life expectancy is increasing. This situation will have a great impact on the management of patients with prostate cancer, especially in those of low risk, susceptible to a conservative management under active surveillance (AS). Regarding these patients' profile, it is necessary to answer the following questions: ¿for how long to continue with the AS scheme?, ¿which tests will be required?, ¿is it possible to carry out a transition to observation with oncological safety? The objective of this work is to analyse those patients with prostatic cancer who have been in AS with 75 years of age or more and assess the safety of the observation in an AS series with a long follow-up.  Material and methods:   We analysed our prospective cohort of AS patients between the years 1999 and 2018,including those who had been in follow-up with 75 years or more. They were offered treatment with curative intent when there were progression criteria and transition to observation under the urologist's decision. Some intermediate risk patients were included in the analysis. Comorbidity changes were analysed with the Charlson comorbidity index at entry and exit of AS. The progression and mortality of the patients were studied according to the management they received.  Results:   From 347 AS patients, 90 patients fulfilled the afore mentioned criteria and 15 (16.7%) were intermediate risk. The median follow-up was 6.4 years and 73 (81.1%) had low comorbidity (Charlson<2).There were 40 (44.4%) patients who left AS, 17 (18.9%) of them went to observationand the rest, 21 (23.3%), received curative treatment. There was a significant difference in comorbidity, measured by the Charlson index, at entry and exit of AS (P<.05) among patients receiving active treatment and the ones submitted to observation.No case of cancer-specific death or progression was observed in the observation group.  Conclusion:   The transition from an active surveillance management to observation of prostate cancer elderly patients, as well as the decision to carry out a treatment with curative intent, seems controversial. In our series, this transition in patients older than 75 years does not increase the oncological risk.""","""['G Fernández-Conejo', 'E de la Peña', 'V Hernández', 'E Pérez-Fernández', 'C Llorente']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Actas Urol Esp (Engl Ed)""","""['Quantifying the Transition from Active Surveillance to Watchful Waiting Among Men with Very Low-risk Prostate Cancer.', 'Health-related quality of life in active surveillance and radical prostatectomy for low-risk prostate cancer: a prospective observational study (HAROW - Hormonal therapy, Active Surveillance, Radiation, Operation, Watchful Waiting).', 'Active surveillance in low-risk prostate cancer.

In the first step, 3,3'-dithiodipropionic acid di(N-hydroxysuccinimide ester) (DSP) was self-assembled on a gold screen printed electrode (SPE). Then, the target proteins were attached covalently to the DSP-SPE. The imprinted cocktail polymer ((MIP(PSA, Myo)-SPE)) was synthesized at the SPE surface using acrylamide as monomer, N,N'-methylenebisacrylamide as a crosslinker, and PSA and Myo as the templates, respectively. The MIP-SPE was specific for the impedimetric sensing of PSA and Myo. After that, a nanocomposite (NCP) was synthesized based on the decorated magnetite nanoparticles with multi-walled carbon nanotube, graphene oxide and specific antibody for PSA (Ab). Then, NCP incubated with (MIP(PSA, Myo)-SPE. The modified electrodes and synthesized nanoparticles were characterized using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, dynamic light scattering, surface plasmon resonance and scanning electron microscopy. The limits of detections were found to be 5.4 pg mL-1 and 0.83 ng mL-1 with the linear dynamic ranges of 0.01-100 and 1-20000 ng mL-1 for PSA and Myo, respectively. The ability of proposed biosensor to detect PSA and Myo simultaneously with high sensitivity and specificity offers a powerful opportunity for the new generation of biosensors.

Systematic investigation of potential prognostic and diagnostic biomarkers""","""Background:   The identification of appropriate biomarkers is essential to support important clinical decisions in patients with prostate cancer. The aim of our study was a systematic bioinformatical analysis of the mRNA expression of all genes available for the prostate adenocarcinoma cohort of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), regarding their potential prognostic and diagnostic role.  Methods:   The study cohort comprises 499 patients (TCGA prostate cancer cohort). mRNA expression data were available for approx. 20,000 genes. The bioinformatical statistical pipeline addressed gene expression differences in tumor vs. benign prostate tissue (including gene set enrichment analysis, GSEA) in samples from tumors with different aggressivenesses (Gleason score), as well as prognostic values in multistep survival analyses.  Results:   Among all genes analyzed, 1754 were significantly downregulated and 1553 genes were significantly upregulated in tumor tissue. In GSEA, 16 of 30 top enriched biological processes were alterations of epigenetic regulation at different levels. Significant correlation with Gleason Score was evident for 8724 genes (range of Pearson r-values 0.09-0.43; all p < 0.05). In univariate Cox regression analyses, mRNA expression of 3571 genes showed statistically significant association with biochemical recurrence-free survival with a range of hazard ratios 0.3-3.8 (p-value 7.4e- 07 to 0.05). Among these, 571 genes were independently associated with biochemical recurrence in multivariate analysis. Access to the full database including results is provided as supplement.  Conclusions:   In our systematic analysis we found a big number of genes of potential diagnostic and prognostic value, many of which have not been studied in prostate cancer to date.

The aim of this cross-sectional study was to investigate the effects of ADT in men with PCa on BMD, bone structure, estimates of whole bone strength and cortical bone distribution. A total of 70 ADT-treated men, 52 PCa controls and 70 healthy controls had DXA lumbar spine and proximal femur aBMD and pQCT distal (4%) and proximal (66%) tibia and radius cortical and trabecular volumetric BMD (vBMD), bone structure, strength and cortical bone distribution assessed.

ADT-treated men had 7.2-7.8% lower lumbar spine aBMD than PCa (P = 0.037) and healthy controls (P = 0.010), with a trend for a lower total hip aBMD in the ADT-treated men (P = 0.07). At the distal tibia, total bone area was 6.2-7.3% greater in ADT-treated men than both controls (P < 0.01), but total vBMD was 8.4-8.7% lower in ADT-treated men than both controls (P < 0.01). Moreover, bone strength index (BSI) was 10.8% lower relative to healthy controls only (P < 0.05).

We hypothesized that insulin, which is elevated in obesity-driven insulin resistance, would increase tumor glucose oxidation in obesity-associated tumors. To test this hypothesis, we applied and validated a stable isotope method to measure the ratio of pyruvate dehydrogenase flux to citrate synthase flux (VPDH/VCS, i.e. the percent of total mitochondrial oxidation fueled by glucose) in tumor cells. Using this method, we found that three tumor cell lines associated with obesity (colon cancer [MC38], breast cancer [4T1], and prostate cancer [TRAMP-C3] cells) increase VPDH/VCS in response to physiologic concentrations of insulin. In contrast, three tumor cell lines that are not associated with obesity (melanoma [YUMM1.7], B cell lymphoma [BCL1 clone 5B1b], and small cell lung cancer [NCI-H69] cells) exhibited no oxidative response to insulin. The observed increase in glucose oxidation in response to insulin correlated with a dose-dependent increase in cell division in obesity-associated tumor cell lines when grown in insulin, whereas no alteration in cell division was seen in tumor types not associated with obesity. These data reveal that a shift in substrate preference in the setting of physiologic insulin may comprise a metabolic signature of obesity-associated tumors that differs from that of those not associated with obesity.""","""['Aviva Rabin-Court', 'Marcos R Rodrigues', 'Xian-Man Zhang', 'Rachel J Perry']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Effect of aging on muscle mitochondrial substrate utilization in humans.', 'Dissociation of Muscle Insulin Resistance from Alterations in Mitochondrial Substrate Preference.', 'Metabolism and insulin signaling in common metabolic disorders and inherited insulin resistance.', 'Differential sensitivity to beta-cell secretagogues in cultured rat pancreatic islets exposed to human interleukin-1 beta.', 'Obesity and colorectal cancer: epidemiology, mechanisms and candidate genes.', 'The Impact of Bariatric Surgery on the Incidence of Colorectal Cancer in Patients with Obesity-a Systematic Review and Meta-analysis of Registry Data.', 'Immunometabolism at the crossroads of obesity and cancer-a Keystone Symposia report.', 'Obesity: a perfect storm for carcinogenesis.', 'Systemic Ablation of Camkk2 Impairs Metastatic Colonization and Improves Insulin Sensitivity in TRAMP Mice: Evidence for Cancer Cell-Extrinsic CAMKK2 Functions in Prostate Cancer.', 'Consensus molecular subtype differences linking colon adenocarcinoma and obesity revealed by a cohort transcriptomic analysis.']"""

Limited data suggest that GnRH (gonadotropin-releasing hormone) antagonist may be associated with a lower risk of cardiovascular disease than GnRH agonist.  Materials and methods:   We performed a phase II, randomized, open label study in men with prostate cancer and preexisting cardiovascular disease who were randomized to receive GnRH agonists or antagonists for 1 year. The primary outcome was endothelial function measured by the EndoPAT 2000 device (Itamar Medical, Caesarea, Israel). The predefined secondary outcome was a new cardiovascular event. Patients were followed for the development of cardiovascular disease, defined as death, myocardial infarction, a cerebrovascular event, percutaneous angioplasty with coronary stent insertion or hospitalizations due to cardiac events.  Results:   A total of 80 patients were enrolled in study, including 41 and 39 who received GnRH antagonist and agonist, respectively. Patients in each arm had similar baseline characteristics. We did not detect a difference in the primary end point (endothelial function) between the groups (mean ± SD reactive hyperemia index 2.07 ± 0.15 vs 1.92 ± 0.11, p=0.42). However, during the trial period a new cardiovascular event (the secondary end point) developed in 15 patients. Of cases new major cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events developed in 9, including death in 2, myocardial infarction in 1, a cerebrovascular event in 2 and percutaneous angioplasty with coronary stent insertion in 4. Of the patients 20% randomized to GnRH agonist experienced a major cardiovascular and cerebrovascular event compared to 3% of those on GnRH antagonist (p=0.013). The absolute risk reduction in major cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events at 12 months using GnRH antagonist was 18.1% (95% CI 4.6-31.2, p=0.032).  Conclusions:   To our knowledge this is the first prospective study to test cardiovascular outcomes among patients with prostate cancer who received androgen deprivation therapy. No differences in the primary end point were noted between the study arms. However, the secondary end point revealed that patients treated with GnRH agonist experienced significantly more major cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events than those treated with GnRH antagonist.

Materials and methods:   Transition zone biopsy tissues from men who did or did not experience clinical progression on placebo, doxazosin, finasteride or combination therapy were assessed for collagen content and architectural changes using picrosirius red birefringence and CT-FIRE (Curvelet Transform-Fiber Extraction) analysis. Correlations were made with annotated demographic and clinical data. Statistical analyses were done with the Pearson correlation coefficient, ANOVA and the t-test.  Results:   High levels of wavy, aligned prostate transition zone collagen significantly correlated with an increased risk of clinical progression among MTOPS trial participants treated with doxazosin plus finasteride, particularly those with a high body mass index.  Conclusions:   Fibrotic changes in the prostate transition zone are associated with an increased risk of clinical progression in men treated with doxazosin plus finasteride. Antifibrotic therapeutics might provide a new treatment approach in men with lower urinary tract dysfunction who do not respond to current medical treatment approaches.""","""['Jill A Macoska#', 'Kristen S Uchtmann#', 'Glen E Leverson', 'Kevin T McVary', 'William A Ricke']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""J Urol""","""['Editorial Comment.', 'Change in sexual function in men with lower urinary tract symptoms/benign prostatic hyperplasia associated with long-term treatment with doxazosin, finasteride and combined therapy.', 'Three-Year Treatment Outcomes of Water Vapor Thermal Therapy Compared to Doxazosin, Finasteride and Combination Drug Therapy in Men with Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia: Cohort Data from the MTOPS Trial.', 'Is Sexual Function Better Preserved After Water Vapor Thermal Therapy or Medical Therapy for Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms due to Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia?', 'Monotherapy versus combination drug therapy for the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia.', 'Finasteride for benign prostatic hyperplasia.', 'Steroid hormone imbalance drives macrophage infiltration and Spp1/osteopontin+ foam cell differentiation in the prostate.', 'Current research and future directions in non-malignant urologic research - proceedings of the annual CAIRIBU meeting.', 'Male Lower Urinary Tract Dysfunction: An Underrepresented Endpoint in Toxicology Research.', 'A retrospective review of canine benign prostatic hyperplasia with and without prostatitis.', 'Osteopontin Deficiency Ameliorates Prostatic Fibrosis and Inflammation.']"""

Microarray analysis was conducted to determine differentially expressed lncRNAs and mRNAs. Gene Set Enrichment analysis was implemented for verification of dys-regulated signaling pathways between DU-145 cells and doxorubicin-resistant prostate cancer DU-145 cells. Relative expression of lncRNA LOXL1-AS1 in doxorubicin-resistant prostate cancer DU-145 cells was analyzed by qRT-PCR. CCK-8 assay and flow cytometry analysis were employed to detect cell proliferation and apoptosis, respectively. Cell migration was performed by transwell assay. Furthermore, targeted relationships between lncRNA LOXL1-AS1 and miR-let-7a-5p, as well as miR-let-7a-5p and EGFR were predicted using bioinformatics analysis and validated by dual-luciferase reporter gene assay. Besides, tumor xenograft assay was utilized for verification of the roles of LOXL1-AS1 in PCa progression in vivo. Microarray analysis showed that lncRNA LOXL1-AS1 and EGFR were both downregulated, while miR-let-7a-5p was upregulated in doxorubicin-resistant prostate cancer DU-145 cells. MiR-let-7a-5p could target both lncRNA LOXL1-AS1 and EGFR to affect PCa progression. Upregulation of lncRNA LOXL1-AS1 promoted cell proliferation and migration, while suppressed cell apoptosis. Besides, it was further confirmed that EGFR was downregulated in drug-resistant PCa cells and negatively correlated with miR-let-7a-5p. Tumor xenograft assay verified that silence of lncRNA LOXL1-AS1 inhibited the tumor growth in vivo in DU-145 cells. Our results demonstrated that the lncRNALOXL1-AS1/miR-let-7a-5p/EGFR axis significantly affected proliferation, migration, and apoptosis of drug-resistant DU-145 Cells, which may provide us with a potential treatment strategy for drug-resistant PCa patients. © 2019 IUBMB Life, 2019.""","""['Tianliang Bai', 'Yabin Liu', 'Binghui Li']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""IUBMB Life""","""['Long noncoding RNA MALAT1 enhances the docetaxel resistance of prostate cancer cells via miR-145-5p-mediated regulation of AKAP12.', 'LncRNA LOXL1-AS1 facilitates the tumorigenesis and stemness of gastric carcinoma via regulation of miR-708-5p/USF1 pathway.', 'LncRNA RHPN1-AS1 inhibition induces autophagy and apoptosis in prostate cancer cells via the miR-7-5p/EGFR/PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway.', 'A Review on the Role of Non-Coding RNAs in the Pathogenesis of Myasthenia Gravis.', 'A review on the role of PCAT6 lncRNA in tumorigenesis.', 'lncRNA PDCD4-AS1 Promotes the Progression of Glioma by Regulating miR-30b-3p/METTL7B Signaling.', 'The effect of ciprofloxacin on doxorubicin cytotoxic activity in the acquired resistance to doxorubicin in DU145 prostate carcinoma cells.', 'Molecular Landscape of LncRNAs in Prostate Cancer: A focus on pathways and therapeutic targets for intervention.', 'Effect and Mechanism of lncRNA CERS6-AS1 on the Biological Behavior of Prostate Cancer Cell.', 'The promising role of new molecular biomarkers in prostate cancer: from coding and non-coding genes to artificial intelligence approaches.']"""

Objective:   To determine the cancer detection rate (CDR) of targeting MRI-visible lesions vs systematic prostate sampling in the diagnosis of clinically significant prostate cancer in men who were biopsy naive.  Design, setting, and participants:   This paired cohort trial, known as the Prospective Assessment of Image Registration in the Diagnosis of Prostate Cancer (PAIREDCAP) study, was conducted in an academic medical center from January 2015 to April 2018. Men undergoing first-time prostate biopsy were enrolled. Paired-cohort participants were a consecutive series of men with MRI-visible lesions (defined by a Prostate Imaging Reporting & Data System version 2 score ≥ 3), who each underwent 3 biopsy methods at the same sitting: first, a systematic biopsy; second, an MRI-lesion biopsy targeted by cognitive fusion; and third, an MRI-lesion targeted by software fusion. Another consecutive series of men without MRI-visible lesions underwent systematic biopsies to help determine the false-negative rate of MRI during the trial period.  Main outcomes and measures:   The primary end point was the detection rate of clinically significant prostate cancer (Gleason grade group ≥2) overall and by each biopsy method separately. The secondary end points were the effects of the Prostate Imaging Reporting & Data System version 2 grade, prostate-specific antigen density, and prostate volume on the primary end point. Tertiary end points were the false-negative rate of MRI and concordance of biopsy-method results by location of detected cancers within the prostate.  Results:   A total of 300 men participated; 248 had MRI-visible lesions (mean [SD] age, 65.5 [7.7] years; 197 were white [79.4%]), and 52 were control participants (mean [SD] age, 63.6 [5.9] years; 39 were white [75%]). The overall CDR was 70% in the paired cohort group, achieved by combining systematic and targeted biopsy results. The CDR by systematic sampling was 15% in the group without MRI-visible lesions. In the paired-cohort group, CDRs varied from 47% (116 of 248 men) when using cognitive fusion biopsy alone, to approximately 60% when using systematic biopsy (149 of 248 men) or either fusion method alone (154 of 248 men), to 70% (174 of 248 men) when combining systematic and targeted biopsy. Discordance of tumor locations suggests that the different biopsy methods detect different tumors. Thus, combining targeting and systematic sampling provide greatest sensitivity for detection of clinically significant prostate cancer. For all biopsy methods, the Prostate Imaging Reporting & Data System version 2 grade and prostate-specific antigen density were directly associated with CDRs, and prostate volume was inversely associated.  Conclusions and relevance:   An MRI-visible lesion in men undergoing first-time prostate biopsy identifies those with a heightened risk of clinically significant prostate cancer. Combining targeted and systematic biopsy offers the best chances of detecting the cancer.""","""['Fuad F Elkhoury', 'Ely R Felker', 'Lorna Kwan', 'Anthony E Sisk', 'Merdie Delfin', 'Shyam Natarajan', 'Leonard S Marks']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""JAMA Surg""","""['Closing the Loop on the Role of Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging-Targeted Prostate Biopsy.', 'Re: Comparison of Targeted vs Systematic Prostate Biopsy in Men Who are Biopsy Naive: The Prospective Assessment of Image Registration in the Diagnosis of Prostate Cancer (PAIREDCAP) Study.', 'The SmartTarget Biopsy Trial: A Prospective, Within-person Randomised, Blinded Trial Comparing the Accuracy of Visual-registration and Magnetic Resonance Imaging/Ultrasound Image-fusion Targeted Biopsies for Prostate Cancer Risk Stratification.', 'Comparison of Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging-Targeted Biopsy With Systematic Transrectal Ultrasonography Biopsy for Biopsy-Naive Men at Risk for Prostate Cancer: A Phase 3 Randomized Clinical Trial.', 'Prostate cancer screening using a combination of risk-prediction, MRI, and targeted prostate biopsies (STHLM3-MRI): a prospective, population-based, randomised, open-label, non-inferiority trial.', 'Detection of Clinically Significant Prostate Cancer Using Magnetic Resonance Imaging-Ultrasound Fusion Targeted Biopsy: A Systematic Review.', 'The value of magnetic resonance imaging and ultrasonography (MRI/US)-fusion biopsy platforms in prostate cancer detection: a systematic review.', 'A Systematic Review of the Current Status of Magnetic Resonance-Ultrasound Images Fusion Software Platforms for Transperineal Prostate Biopsies.', 'Intensive sampling of the umbra and penumbra improves clinically significant prostate cancer detection and reduces risk of grade group upgrading at radical prostatectomy.', 'Is it necessary for all patients with suspicious lesions undergo systematic biopsy in the era of MRI-TRUS fusion targeted biopsy?', 'False-positive magnetic resonance imaging prostate cancer correlates and clinical implications.', 'A Review of Modern Imaging Landscape for Prostate Cancer: A Comprehensive Clinical Guide.']"""

The aim of this study was to evaluate autologous fibrin glue as an additional treatment option to reduce the volume of lymphatic drainage and prevent lymphocele development. Materials and Methods: A total of 75 patients undergoing transperitoneal RARP with ePLND between January and July 2018 were enrolled in this study. Thirty-five patients who received autologous fibrin glue enrolled to study group, another 40 patients who did not receive to control group. Autologous fibrin glue was applied over the PLND areas. Age, body mass index (BMI), pathologic stages, and number of removed lymph nodes (LNs) were compared. The main endpoint was to compare postoperative lymphatic drainage volume and lymphocele formation rate between groups. Results: There was not statistically significant difference between the groups with respect to age, BMI, Gleason score, T-stage, and number of removed LNs. Autologous fibrin glue resulted in 50% (110 mL vs 210 mL; p = 0.037) and 75% reduction of postoperative drainage volume (70 mL vs 270 mL; p = < 0.0001) in study group than control group at postoperative 2nd and 3rd days, respectively. The total drainage volume was also 50% reduced in study group (277 mL vs 577 mL; p = 0.004).

Results:   Of a total of 103 respondents, 18 men (17%) had a personal history of CaP, and 31 (30%) had undergone prostate biopsy. The median risk threshold to proceed with prostate biopsy was 25% (interquartile range 10-50%). Risk thresholds did not vary by race, education, or employment.

Methods:   A retrospective analysis of prospectively acquired data was performed at a single center between 2012 and 2015. Inclusion criteria were (i) 3-T mp-MRI compliant with international guidelines, (ii) Likert ≥ 3/5 lesion, (iii) transperineal template ± targeted index lesion biopsy confirming cancer ≥ Gleason 3 + 3. Index lesions from 164 men were analyzed (119 PZ, 45 TZ). Quantitative MRI and clinical features were used and zone-specific machine learning classifiers were constructed. Models were validated using a fivefold cross-validation and a temporally separated patient cohort. Classifier performance was compared against the opinion of three board-certified radiologists.  Results:   The best PZ classifier trained with prostate-specific antigen density, apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), and maximum enhancement (ME) on DCE-MRI obtained a ROC area under the curve (AUC) of 0.83 following fivefold cross-validation. Diagnostic sensitivity at 50% threshold of specificity was higher for the best PZ model (0.93) when compared with the mean sensitivity of the three radiologists (0.72). The best TZ model used ADC and ME to obtain an AUC of 0.75 following fivefold cross-validation. This achieved higher diagnostic sensitivity at 50% threshold of specificity (0.88) than the mean sensitivity of the three radiologists (0.82).  Conclusions:   Machine learning classifiers predict Gleason pattern 4 in prostate tumors better than radiologists.

In this randomized clinical trial, we aimed to compare the two methods of ADT in terms of quality of life (QOL).  Methods:   Eighty patients who underwent primary ADT for newly diagnosed prostate cancer were randomly assigned to CAB group (Group 1) and LHRH agonist monotherapy group (Group 2). Leuprolide and anti-androgen (bicalutamide 50 mg) were used to minimize the confounding effects caused by medication. QOL was evaluated at baseline, 3 months and 6 months post-ADT using validated EORTC QLQ-C30, PR25, and depression questionnaires. A difference of > 10 points in the EORTC domain scores was defined as 'clinically significant'.  Results:   In the baseline characteristics, there was no significant difference between the two groups. At 3 months after ADT, Group 1 had significantly lower pain scores than Group 2 (p = 0.004), while Group 1 had significantly poorer diarrhea symptom score than Group 2, without clinical significance (p = 0.047). No significant differences were observed in the C30, PR25 domains, and the depression score at 3 months. At 6 months, the QOL scores of all the groups were similar.  Conclusions:   There was no difference in the patient's QOL, except that CAB group was associated with significantly better pain relief than LHRH agonist monotherapy at 3 months following ADT, which was not sustained thereafter.

Since the CD44 level increase was most significant in radioresistant PCa cells compared with parental cells among CSC markers tested, we isolated the CD44+ population from LNCaP/LNCaPR18 and C4-2/C4-2R26 cell sets via the immunomagnetic separation method and used them as CSC sources. We detected lower AR level, but higher glucocorticoid receptor (GR) level in CD44+ CSCs than CD44- non-CSCs. Higher GR level in CD44+ CSCs than CD44- cells was also detected when cells were isolated from mouse tumor tissues of LNCaPR18 cell and C4-2R26 cell-derived human xenografts and grown in culture. We then found blocking the GR signaling by adding the anti-GR agent mifepristone into the cell culture inhibited the CD44+ CSC growth while the addition of the anti-AR agent enzalutamide enhanced the CSC growth. In xenograft mouse studies in which tumors were developed from the injection of CD44+ CSCs of LNCaPR18 or C4-2R26 cell lines, retarded tumor growth in mifepristone-injected mice was observed compared with vehicle-treated mice. We next discovered the GR regulation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. We further found that the serum/glucocorticoid regulated kinase 1 (SGK1) is the GR downstream molecule that mediates Wnt/β-catenin signaling activation. Therefore, inhibition of either SGK1 or Wnt/β-catenin signaling impaired the in vitro CD44+ CSC growth. From these results, we suggest that blocking GR signaling or its downstream SGK1-Wnt/β-catenin signaling axis may suppress the radiation-induced CSC increase in PCa. KEY MESSAGES: Higher CSC population exists in radioresistant PCa cells than parental cells. Higher GR levels (and lower AR level) in CD44+ CSCs than CD44- non-CSCs. Use of anti-GR agent blocked the growth of CD44+ CSCs in in vitro/in vivo tests. GR downstream SGK1-Wnt/β-catenin signaling axis mediates the CSC increase. Targeting this signaling axis may enhance the radiotherapy efficacy in treating PCa.""","""['Feng Chen#', 'Xiaodong Chen#', 'Yu Ren', 'Guobin Weng', 'Peter C Keng', 'Yuhchyau Chen', 'Soo Ok Lee']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""J Mol Med (Berl)""","""['Retraction Note: Radiation-induced glucocorticoid receptor promotes CD44\u2009+\u2009prostate cancer stem cell growth through activation of SGK1-Wnt/β-catenin signaling.', 'Glucocorticoid receptor upregulation increases radioresistance and triggers androgen independence of prostate cancer.', 'Glucocorticoid receptor activity contributes to resistance to androgen-targeted therapy in prostate cancer.', 'Gamma-Secretase Inhibitor IX (GSI) Impairs Concomitant Activation of Notch and Wnt-Beta-Catenin Pathways in CD44+ Gastric Cancer Stem Cells.', 'Cellular and Molecular Biology of Cancer Stem Cells of Hepatocellular Carcinoma.', ""Self-Renewal and Pluripotency in Osteosarcoma Stem Cells' Chemoresistance: Notch, Hedgehog, and Wnt/β-Catenin Interplay with Embryonic Markers."", 'Cancer Stem Cell Markers for Urinary Carcinoma.', 'Multiomics Differences in Lung Squamous Cell Carcinoma Patients with High Radiosensitivity Index Compared with Those with Low Radiosensitivity Index.', 'SGK1 in Human Cancer: Emerging Roles and Mechanisms.', 'The Antiasthma Medication Ciclesonide Suppresses Breast Cancer Stem Cells through Inhibition of the Glucocorticoid Receptor Signaling-Dependent YAP Pathway.', 'Synergistic antitumor interaction of valproic acid and simvastatin sensitizes prostate cancer to docetaxel by targeting CSCs compartment via YAP inhibition.']"""

However, RR is poorly understood in the prognosis of radiotherapy. Although radiotherapy is important in the treatment of prostate cancer (PCa), acquisition of RR has been reported in PCa with an increased number of cancer stem cells (CSCs), neuroendocrine differentiation (NED) and epithelial-mesenchymal transition. However, to the best of our knowledge, the mechanism underlying RR acquisition during fractionated irradiation remains unclear. In the present study, human PCa cell lines were subjected to fractionated irradiation according to a fixed schedule as follows: Irradiation (IR)1, 2 Gy/day with a total of 20 Gy; IR2, 4 Gy/day with a total of 20 Gy; and IR3, 4 Gy/day with a total of 56 Gy. The expression of cluster of differentiation (CD)44, a CSC marker, was identified to be increased by fractionated irradiation, particularly in DU145 cells. The expression levels of CD133 and CD138 were increased compared with those in parental cells following a single irradiation or multiple irradiations; however, the expression levels decreased with subsequent irradiation. RR was evidently acquired by exposure to 56 Gy radiation, which resulted in increased expression of the NED markers CD133 and CD138, and increased mRNA expression levels of the pluripotency-associated genes octamer-binding transcription factor 4 and Nanog homeobox. These data indicate that radiation-induced CSCs emerge due to the exposure of cells to fractionated irradiation. In addition, the consequent increase in the expression of NED markers is possibly induced by the increased expression of pluripotency-associated genes. Therefore, it can be suggested that cancer cells acquire RR due to increased expression of pluripotency-associated genes following exposure to fractionated irradiation.""","""['Kosho Murata', 'Ryo Saga', 'Satoru Monzen', 'Echi Tsuruga', 'Kazuki Hasegawa', 'Yoichiro Hosokawa']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Oncol Lett""","""['Effector genes altered in MCF-7 human breast cancer cells after exposure to fractionated ionizing radiation.', 'Acquired radioresistance in EMT6 mouse mammary carcinoma cell line is mediated by CTLA-4 and PD-1 through JAK/STAT/PI3K pathway.', 'Single-cell RNA-seq of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma cell line with fractionated irradiation reveals radioresistant gene expression patterns.', 'Neuroendocrine differentiation in prostate cancer: a mechanism of radioresistance and treatment failure.', 'Clinically relevant radioresistant cell line: a simple model to understand cancer radioresistance.', 'Prostate Cancer Scoring Index for Risk of Progression of Radioresistant Disease.', 'DNA‑PKcs phosphorylation specific inhibitor, NU7441, enhances the radiosensitivity of clinically relevant radioresistant oral squamous cell carcinoma cells.', 'Radioresistance Mechanisms in Prostate Cancer Cell Lines Surviving Ultra-Hypo-Fractionated EBRT: Implications and Possible Clinical Applications.', 'Prostate Cancer Stem Cells: The Role of CD133.', 'Tumor radioresistance caused by radiation-induced changes of stem-like cell content and sub-lethal damage repair capability.']"""

Previously, it was demonstrated that IL-35 expression is significantly increased in a wide range of tumor tissues, promoting angiogenesis and inhibiting the anti-tumor immune response. In the present study, the IL-35 protein expression levels were measured in the plasma and tumor tissue of patients with prostate cancer (PCA), and its role was determined in the occurrence and progression of PCA. Plasma IL-35 expression levels were measured using ELISA, and the associations of plasma IL-35 and clinicopathological parameters were analyzed. Receiver operating characteristic curves were plotted to analyze the role of IL-35 as a clinical biomarker for the diagnosis of PCA. Survival curve analysis demonstrated a significant decrease in the survival time in months in patients with PCA and increased expression levels of IL-35 compared with the participants with relatively lower IL-35 protein expression levels. IL-35 expression was detected using immunohistochemical staining of a human PCA tissue microarray. Plasma IL-35 expression levels in the patients with PCA were significantly increased compared with the patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia and the healthy controls. An increase in the plasma concentration of IL-35 was associated with progression of PCA stage and an increase in the Gleason score. Significant differences in AUCs for IL-35 and prostate-specific antigen were observed with regard to the presence of lymph node and distant metastases in patients with PCA. The expression levels of Epstein-barr virus-induced gene 3 (EBI3) and IL-12A (p35; the subunits which together form IL-35) were significantly increased in the tumor tissue compared with the adjacent normal tissue. An association was identified between the Gleason score and the expression of EBI3 and p35. Therefore, increased expression of IL-35 in the plasma and tumor tissues may contribute to the progression and metastasis of PCA, and IL-35 may serve as a novel prognostic biomarker or therapeutic target for the treatment of PCA.""","""['Jialin Zhu', 'Xueling Yang', 'Yan Wang', 'Haonan Zhang', 'Zhi Guo']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Oncol Lett""","""['More advantages in detecting bone and soft tissue metastases from prostate cancer using 18F-PSMA PET/CT.', 'Interleukin-35 as a predictor of prostate cancer in patients undergoing initial prostate biopsy.', 'Increased Paxillin expression in prostate cancer is associated with advanced pathological features, lymph node metastases and biochemical recurrence.', 'The association of CXCR4 expression with clinicopathological significance and potential drug target in prostate cancer: a meta-analysis and literature review.', 'Role of Interleukin-1 family in bone metastasis of prostate cancer.', 'The Molecular Role of IL-35 in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer.', 'Tumor promoting roles of IL-10, TGF-β, IL-4, and IL-35: Its implications in cancer immunotherapy.', 'Engineered exosomes delivering specific tumor-suppressive RNAi attenuate oral cancer progression.', 'IL-12 Family Cytokines in Cancer and Immunotherapy.', 'Regulatory B cells in cancer.']"""

Intervention:   Community pharmacy teams were trained to deliver a health assessment including fitness, strength and anthropometric measures. A computer algorithm generated a personalised lifestyle prescription for a home-based programme accompanied by supporting resources. The health assessment was repeated 12 weeks later and support phone calls were provided at weeks 1 and 6.  Participants:   116 men who completed treatment for prostate cancer.  Outcome measures:   The feasibility and acceptability of the intervention and the delivery model were assessed by evaluating study processes (rate of participant recruitment, consent, retention and adverse events), by analysing delivery data and semi-structured interviews with participants and by focus groups with pharmacy teams. Physical activity (measured with accelerometry at baseline, 3 and 6 months) and patient reported outcomes (activation, dietary intake and quality of life) were evaluated. Change in physical activity was used to inform the sample size calculations for a future trial.  Results:   Out of 403 invited men, 172 (43%) responded and 116 (29%) participated. Of these, 99 (85%) completed the intervention and 88 (76%) completed the 6-month follow-up (attrition 24%). Certain components of the intervention were feasible and acceptable (eg, community pharmacy delivery), while others were more challenging (eg, fitness assessment) and will be refined for future studies. By 3 months, moderate to vigorous physical activity increased on average by 34 min (95% CI 6 to 62, p=0.018), but this was not sustained over 6 months.

Automated Bone Scan Index (aBSI) based on artificial intelligence has been proposed as an imaging biomarker for the quantification of skeletal metastases from bone scintigraphy.  Objective:   To investigate how an increase in aBSI during treatment may predict clinical outcome in a randomised controlled clinical trial including patients with high-risk prostate cancer.  Design, setting, and participants:   We retrospectively selected all patients from the Zometa European Study (ZEUS)/SPCG11 study with image data of sufficient quality to allow for aBSI assessment at baseline and at 48-mo follow-up. Data on aBSI were obtained using EXINIboneBSI software, blinded for clinical data and randomisation of zoledronic acid treatment. Data on age, overall survival (OS), and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) at baseline and upon follow-up were available from the study database.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Association between clinical parameters and aBSI increase during treatment was evaluated using Cox proportional-hazards regression models, Kaplan-Meier estimates, and log-rank test. Discrimination between prognostic variables was assessed using the concordance index (C-index).  Results and limitations:   In this cohort, 176 patients with bone metastases and a change in aBSI from baseline to follow-up of ≤0.3 had a significantly longer median survival time than patients with an aBSI change of >0.3 (p<0.0001). The increase in aBSI was significantly associated with OS (p<0.01 and C-index=0.65), while age and PSA change were not.  Conclusions:   The aBSI used as an objective imaging biomarker predicted outcome in prostate cancer patients in the ZEUS/SPCG11 study. An analysis of the change in aBSI from baseline to 48-mo follow-up represents a valuable tool for prognostication and monitoring of prostate cancer patients with bone metastases.  Patient summary:   The increase in the burden of skeletal metastases, as measured by the automated Bone Scan Index (aBSI), during treatment was associated with overall survival in patients from the Zometa European Study/SPCG11 study.

Methods: 68Ga-PSMA-PET/CT scans of PC patients available in our database were evaluated retrospectively for liver metastases. Metastases were identified using 68Ga-PSMA-PET, CT, MRI and follow-up scans. Different parameters including, maximum standardized uptake values (SUVmax) of the healthy liver and liver metastases were assessed by two- and three-dimensional regions of interest (2D/3D ROI).  Results:   One hundred three liver metastases in 18 of 739 PC patients were identified. In total, 80 PSMA-positive (77.7%) and 23 PSMA-negative (22.3%) metastases were identified. The mean SUVmax of PSMA-positive liver metastases was significantly higher than that of the normal liver tissue in both 2D and 3D ROI (p ≤ 0.05). The mean SUVmax of PSMA-positive metastases was 9.84 ± 4.94 in 2D ROI and 10.27 ± 5.28 in 3D ROI; the mean SUVmax of PSMA-negative metastases was 3.25 ± 1.81 in 2D ROI and 3.40 ± 1.78 in 3D ROI, and significantly lower than that of the normal liver tissue (p ≤ 0.05). A significant (p ≤ 0.05) correlation between SUVmax in PSMA-positive liver metastases and both size (ρSpearman = 0.57) of metastases and PSA serum level (ρSpearman = 0.60) was found.  Conclusions:   In 68Ga-PSMA-PET, the majority of liver metastases highly overexpress PSMA and is therefore directly detectable.

Here, we describe a rare case of a patient with mCRPC who was treated with CBZ chemotherapy and showed a durable radiological response and a complete biochemical response.  Case presentation:   A 43-year-old man with prostate cancer and metastasis of the pubic bone underwent neoadjuvant androgen deprivation and docetaxel therapy, followed by laparoscopic prostatectomy, extended lymphadenectomy, and metastatectomy in 2014. Pathological examination revealed residual adenocarcinoma in the prostate and pubic bone (pathological T stage 3b, positive surgical margin). Following the operation, he received adjuvant radiation therapy (66 Gy) to the pelvic floor. His serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level decreased to < 0.01 ng/mL but gradually increased following docetaxel chemotherapy. Imaging findings indicated five tiny nodules in the bilateral lungs. Biopsy specimens are difficult to obtain and might not reflect the precise extent of the disease owing to heterogeneity in patients with CRPC. Thus, we performed liquid biopsy to isolate circulating tumor cells (CTCs), and overall 156 CTCs were detected per 7.5 mL. Almost all CTCs were androgen receptor-negative in the nucleus. We diagnosed the five nodules as lung metastases from docetaxel-resistant CRPC with few AR-signaling-dependent cancer cells. The patient was initiated on CBZ chemotherapy (25 mg/m2) according to the standard protocol in August 2016, instead of using a second-generation AR-targeting agent. After 2 cycles of CBZ chemotherapy, PSA level decreased to < 0.01 ng/mL and the lung metastases completely disappeared, with a reduced CTC count of < 5. To date, the patient has been receiving intermittent CBZ chemotherapy.  Conclusions:   We presented a rare case of a patient with mCRPC who was successfully treated with early CBZ chemotherapy.

The aim of this study was to compare three innovative technologies for CTC enumeration in 131 high-risk patients with PCa, before and after radiotherapy, combined with androgen deprivation. The CTC number was tested using the FDA-cleared CellSearch® system, the dual fluoro-EPISPOT assay that only detects functional CTCs, and the in vivo CellCollector® technology. The highest percentage of CTC-positive patients was detected with the CellCollector® (48%) and dual fluoro-EPISPOT (42%) assays, while the CellSearch® system presented the lowest rate (14%). Although the concordance among methods was only 23%, the cumulative positivity rate was 79%. A matched-pair analysis of the samples before, and after, treatment suggested a trend toward a decrease in CTC count after treatment with all methods. CTC tended to be positivity correlated with age for the fluoro-EPISPOT assay and with PSA level from the data of three assays. Combining different CTC assays improved CTC detection rates in patients with non-metastatic high-risk PCa before and after treatment.

DU-145 and PC-3 cell lines were treated with lycopene content from different tomato-based food products (500-5000 μg/mL) for 96 h. The data showed a decrease in cell viability in both DU-145 and PC-3 cells after treatment with all lycopene extracts from tomato-based food products. Analysis of cell cycle revealed a decrease in the percentage of prostate cancer cells in G0/G1 and G2/M phases after 96 h of treatment when using lycopene content from tomato paste and tomato extract. However, lycopene extracted from tomato sauce and ketchup promoted a decrease in the percentage of cells in G0/G1 phase and an increase in S and G2/M phases after 96 h of treatment. Lycopene content from all of those tomato-based food products also increased apoptosis in both prostate cancer cell lines.

Resveratrol (Res) as a phytochemical in grapes and red wine has diverse biological effects such as anti-inflammation, anti-oxidation and anti-cancer. CXCR4 as a chemokine receptor has been found to be upregulated in cancer metastasis and has been used as a prognostic marker in various types of cancer, including leukemia, breast cancer, and prostate cancer. In this study, we focused on the role of DHT in the induction of prostate cancer progression by affecting the AR and CXCR4 pathway. Also, we investigated the inhibition effect of resveratrol on DHT-induced prostate cancer metastasis. In cell viability assay, DHT increased the cell viability of LNCaP prostate cancer cells, on the other hand, Res and its combination with bicalutamide (BCT) as an AR-antagonist or AMD3100 as a CXCR4 inhibitor significantly reduced the cell viability promoted by DHT. Trans-well migration assay and wound healing assay represented the similar results with cell viability assay. According to the results of TUNEL assay, the apoptotic activity was induced by treatment of Res. As results of western blot analysis, the expression of AR, CXCR4, p-PI3K, and p-AKT and the downstream genes related with cell cycle progression and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) were decreased and the expression of the apoptosis-related genes was increased by treatment of Res and its combination with BCT or AMD3100.

When the murine macrophage cell line (RAW 264.7), human monocyte cell line (THP-1), and human peripheral blood monocytes were cultured with androgen-resistant CaP cell lines, DHT increased cytotoxicity of macrophages in a concentration-dependent manner. Further studies revealed that DHT induced M1 polarization and increased the expression levels of TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) in macrophages and that this effect was abrogated when TRAIL was neutralized with a blocking antibody or small interfering RNA. Subsequent experiments demonstrated that induction of TRAIL expression was regulated by direct binding of androgen receptor to the TRAIL promoter region. Finally, an in vivo mouse study demonstrated that castration enhanced the growth of an androgen-resistant murine CaP tumor and that this protumorigenic effect of castration was blocked when macrophages were removed with clodronate liposomes.

Despite evidence of immune clearance in mouse models, it is not known how senescent cells (SnCs) persist and accumulate with age or in tumors in individuals. Here, we identify cooperative mechanisms that orchestrate the immunoevasion and persistence of normal and cancer human SnCs through extracellular targeting of natural killer receptor signaling. Damaged SnCs avoid immune recognition through MMPs-dependent shedding of NKG2D-ligands reinforced via paracrine suppression of NKG2D receptor-mediated immunosurveillance. These coordinated immunoediting processes are evident in residual, drug-resistant tumors from cohorts of >700 prostate and breast cancer patients treated with senescence-inducing genotoxic chemotherapies. Unlike in mice, these reversible senescence-subversion mechanisms are independent of p53/p16 and exacerbated in oncogenic RAS-induced senescence. Critically, the p16INK4A tumor suppressor can disengage the senescence growth arrest from the damage-associated immune senescence program, which is manifest in benign nevi lesions where indolent SnCs accumulate over time and preserve a non-pro-inflammatory tissue microenvironment maintaining NKG2D-mediated immunosurveillance.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the association between ADT and cerebral infarction in patients with prostate cancer (PC) using big data.  Materials and methods:   Using information from the National Health Insurance Service database representative of the entire Korean adult PC population (n = 206 735), data regarding ADT and cerebral infarction between 2009 and 2016 were analyzed. Adjusted hazard ratios for cerebral infarction associated with ADT were estimated using propensity score-matched Cox proportional hazards models and Kaplan-Meier survival analyses.  Results:   The final cohort comprised 36 146 individuals with PC, including 24 069 men (66.6%) who underwent ADT. During the mean follow-up of 4.1 years, 2792 patients were newly diagnosed with cerebral infarction. In the unmatched cohort, there was a significant difference in the annual incidence of cerebral infarction between the ADT and non-ADT groups (22.8 vs 14.6 per 1000 person-years, respectively). However, there was no significant difference between the ADT and non-ADT groups in the matched cohort (14.9 vs 14.6 per 1000 person-years). The adjusted hazard ratio for cerebral infarction for PC patients who underwent ADT was 1.045 (95% CI 0.943-1.159; P = 0.401) compared with those who did not undergo ADT. In addition, the cumulative duration of ADT was also not associated with an increased risk for cerebral infarction. However, older age, hypertension, diabetes, myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, peripheral vascular disease, renal disease, dementia, and atrial fibrillation were revealed to be factors contributing to cerebral infarction.

However, it remains challenging under the current imaging techniques due to the heterogeneous nature of PCa and the suboptimal sensitivity of the techniques themselves. Herein, a novel genetic amplified nanoparticle tumor-homing strategy to enhance the MRI accuracy of ultrasmall PCa lesions is reported. This strategy could specifically drive TfR expressions in PCa under PCa-specific DD3 promoter, and thus remarkably increase Tf-USPIONs concentrations in a highly accurate manner while minimizing their non-specific off-target effects on normal tissues. Consequently, this strategy can pinpoint an ultrasmall PCa lesion, which is otherwise blurred in the current MRI, and thereby addresses the unmet key need in MRI imaging for focal therapy. With this proof-of-concept experiment, the synergistic gene-nano strategy holds great promise to boost the MRI effects of a wide variety of commonly used nanoscale and molecular probes that are otherwise limited. In addition, such a strategy may also be translated and applied to MR-specific imaging of other types of cancers by using their respective tumor-specific promoters.""","""['Yang Zhao', 'Jing Peng', 'Jinyi Yang', 'Enlong Zhang', 'Ling Huang', 'Hong Yang', 'Eugenia Kakadiaris', 'Jingjin Li', 'Bin Yan', 'Zhiqun Shang', 'Ning Jiang', 'Xuening Zhang', 'Gang Han', 'Yuanjie Niu']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Adv Mater""","""['More advantages in detecting bone and soft tissue metastases from prostate cancer using 18F-PSMA PET/CT.', 'Biocompatible Peptide-Coated Ultrasmall Superparamagnetic Iron Oxide Nanoparticles for In Vivo Contrast-Enhanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging.', 'Ligand-mediated endocytosis of nanoparticles in neural stem cells: implications for cellular magnetic resonance imaging.', 'Multiparametric MRI in detection and staging of prostate cancer.', 'An update on prostate biopsy in the era of magnetic resonance imaging.', 'Ferroptosis landscape in prostate cancer from molecular and metabolic perspective.', 'Enhancer RNA promotes resistance to radiotherapy in bone-metastatic prostate cancer by m6A modification.', 'Multifunctional Protein Hybrid Nanoplatform for Synergetic Photodynamic-Chemotherapy of Malignant Carcinoma by Homologous Targeting Combined with Oxygen Transport.', 'Long non-coding RNA NEAT1 promotes bone metastasis of prostate cancer through N6-methyladenosine.']"""

Patients and methods:   A total of 122 RCP cases resected between 2002 and 2012 at our center were included for study. Survival of BCa patient was compared using the Kaplan-Meier method and the log-rank test. Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to analyze the impact of iPCa on the 5-year overall mortality of BCa patients after RCP.  Results:   Among the 122 BCa cases that underwent RCP, 38 cases (31.1%) had iPCa, in which, 17 cases (44.7%) were identified as clinically significant iPCa (csPCa). BCa patients with iPCa were older (71 vs 64 years, p = 0.004) and had higher preoperative PSA level (3.1 ng/mL vs 1.4 ng/mL, p = 0.017) when compared to those without iPCa. Cases with iPCa showed a more favorable 5-year OS than cases without iPCa, although this difference did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.219). When excluding the higher risk cases with Gleason score (GS) ≥ 4 + 3 and/or preoperative PSA > 10 ng/mL, BCa patients with iPCa showed a significantly longer OS than cases without iPCa on univariate analysis (p = 0.044), but not on multivariate analysis (p = 0.125).  Conclusion:   Our results demonstrated that the frequent findings of low-risk iPCa in BCa patients could indicate the potential possibility of shared pathogenesis pathways between iPCa and BCa.

To achieve this, an accurate identification of tumor boundaries during surgery is critical, but intra-operative tumor visualization remains challenging. Fluorescence imaging is a promising method to improve tumor detection and delineate tumor boundaries during surgery, but the lack of stable, long-circulating, clinically-translatable fluorescent probes that can identify tumors with high signal-to-noise ratios and low background fluorescence signals have prevented its widespread application. Methods: We screened the optical properties of several fluorescent dyes before and after nanoprobe encapsulation, and then identified nanoprobes with quenched fluorescence that were re-activated upon dye release. The physical and biological properties of these nanoprobes leading to fluorescence activation were investigated in vitro. Further, the cancer imaging properties of both free dyes and nanoprobe-encapsulated dyes were compared in vivo. Results: A novel fluorescent nanoprobe was prepared by combining two FDA-approved agents commonly used in the clinic: Feraheme (FH) and indocyanine green (ICG). The resulting FH-entrapped ICG nanoprobe [FH(ICG)] displayed quenched fluorescence compared to other nanoprobes, and this quenched fluorescence was re-activated in acidic tumor microenvironment conditions (pH 6.8) and upon uptake into cancer cells. Finally, in vivo studies in a prostate cancer mouse model demonstrated that FH(ICG) treatments enhance long-term fluorescence signals in tumors compared to ICG treatments, allowing for fluorescence-guided tumor identification using clinically relevant fluorescence cameras. Conclusions: FH(ICG) nanoprobes were identified as fluorescent nanoprobes with beneficial fluorescence activation properties compared to other FH-entrapped dyes. The activatable nature of this nanoprobe allows for a low background fluorescence signal and high signal-to-noise ratio within a long-circulating nanoagent, which allows for long-term fluorescence signals from tumors that enabled their fluorescence-guided detection. This activatable nanoprobe offers tremendous potential as a clinically translatable image-guided cancer therapy modality that can be prepared in a clinical setting.""","""['Derek Reichel', 'Manisha Tripathi', 'Pramod Butte', 'Rola Saouaf', 'J Manuel Perez']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Nanotheranostics""","""['The second window ICG technique demonstrates a broad plateau period for near infrared fluorescence tumor contrast in glioblastoma.', 'PET/NIR-II fluorescence imaging and image-guided surgery of glioblastoma using a folate receptor α-targeted dual-modal nanoprobe.', 'Hyaluronic acid formulation of near infrared fluorophores optimizes surgical imaging in a prostate tumor xenograft.', 'Activatable Alexa Fluor680-conjugated panitumumab and indocyanine green-conjugated trastuzumab cocktail.', 'Identification and usage of fluorescent probes as nanoparticle contrast agents in detecting cancer.', 'The application of indocyanine green in guiding prostate cancer treatment.', 'IR820 functionalized melanin nanoplates for dual-modal imaging and photothermal tumor eradication.', 'Multiplexed imaging in oncology.', 'Tumor microenvironment triggered biodegradation of inorganic nanoparticles for enhanced tumor theranostics.', 'A Translational Porcine Model for Human Cell-Based Therapies in the Treatment of Posttraumatic Osteoarthritis After Anterior Cruciate Ligament Injury.']"""

Nitroxoline has been found to have effective anticancer properties in several cancer types. We investigated the efficacy of a combination therapy involving nitroxoline and PD-1 blockade in a prostate cancer mouse model. In our in vitro analysis, we found that nitroxoline inhibited the viability and proliferation of the mouse prostate cancer cell line RM9-Luc-PSA. Additionally, nitroxoline downregulated the expressions of phospho-PI3 kinase, phospho-Akt (Thr308), phospho-Akt (Ser473), phospho-GSK-3β, Bcl-2, and Bcl-xL. Nitroxoline also downregulated programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression levels in prostate cancer cell line and tumor tissue. In our murine prostate cancer orthotopic model, nitroxoline plus PD-1 blockade synergistically suppressed tumor growth when compared with nitroxoline or PD-1 blockade alone, leading to reductions in tumor weight, bioluminescence tumor signals, and serum prostate-specific antigen levels. Furthermore, fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis showed that the combination strategy significantly enhanced antitumor immunity by increasing CD44+CD62L+CD8+ memory T cell numbers and reducing myeloid-derived suppressor cell numbers in peripheral blood.

In this study, we compared metabolic pathways between isogenic human androgen-dependent and castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) patient-derived xenograft models, and found consistent activation of the γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) shunt in CRPC. This difference was the result of phosphorylation and activation of glutamate decarboxylase 65 (GAD65), which synthesizes GABA from glutamate by decarboxylation. Mechanistic investigation showed that GABA binds to and retains the androgen receptor (AR) in the nucleus by facilitating AR association with the nuclear zinc finger protein ZNHIT3. GAD65 knockdown decreased the growth of multiple established CRPC xenografts and markedly delayed the time to emergence of castration resistance. These data encourage exploring GAD65 as a therapeutic target for CRPC.

Patients and methods:   Within the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database (1988-2015) we identified 11,206 stage I testicular seminoma patients.

After propensity score (PS) matching, cumulative incidence plots and multivariable competing risks regression models (MCRRMs) tested for CSM and OCM.  Results:   Of all 11,206 patients, 4434 (40%), 918 (8%), and 5854 (52%), respectively, underwent surveillance, CHT, or RT after initial orchiectomy. Surveillance (EAPC: 7.5%; P < .001) and CHT (EAPC: 13.5%; P < .001) rates increased over time, whereas RT rates decreased (EAPC: -3.8%; P < .001). After PS matching, in MCRRMs surveillance was an independent predictor of CSM, relative to AT (hazard ratio [HR], 2.59; P = .04). Conversely, surveillance versus AT did not affect OCM (HR, 1.52; P = .051). All other analyses that focused on CSM and OCM, namely surveillance versus RT, surveillance versus CHT, and RT versus CHT resulted in nonsignificant differences (all P > .5).

Apigenin (API) is a dietary flavonoid which exerts an antimetastatic effect in various cancer types. Sparc/osteonectin, cwcv, and kazal-like domains proteoglycan 1 (SPOCK1) is a crucial modulator of tumor growth and metastasis in cancers. However, the role and underlying regulatory mechanisms of SPOCK1 in the API-mediated antimetastatic effects of PCa remain unclear.  Methods:   MTS, colony formation, wound-healing, and transwell assays were conducted to evaluate the effects of API on PCa cell proliferative, migratory, and invasive potentials. In vivo orthotopic bioluminescent xenograft model were employed to determine antitumor activity of API. PCa cells were transfected with either Snail-, Slug-, SPOCK1-overexpressing vector, or small hairpin (sh)SPOCK1 to determine the invasive abilities and expression levels of SPOCK1 and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) biomarkers in response to API treatment. Immunohistochemical (IHC) assays were carried out to evaluate the expression level of SPOCK1 in PCa xenografts and a PCa tissue array. Associations of SPOCK1 expression with clinicopathological features and prognoses of patients with PCa were analyzed by GEO or TCGA RNA-sequencing data.  Results:   API significantly suppressed in vitro PCa cell proliferation, migration, and invasion and inhibited in vivo PCa tumor growth and metastasis. Moreover, survival times of animals were also prolonged after API treatment. Mechanistic studies revealed that API treatment resulted in downregulation of SPOCK1, which was accompanied by reduced expressions of mesenchymal markers and subsequent attenuation of invasive abilities of PCa cells. Overexpression of SPOCK1 in PCa xenografts resulted in significant promotion of tumor progression and relieved the anticancer activities induced by API, whereas knockdown of SPOCK1 had opposite effects. In clinical, SPOCK1 levels were higher in tumor tissues compared to non-tumor tissues, which was also significantly correlated with shorter disease-free survival in PCa patients.  Conclusions:   Levels of SPOCK1 increase with the progression of human PCa which suggests that SPOCK1 may act as a prognostic marker or therapeutic target for patients with PCa.

Spatial attention gates (AGs) were incorporated into a novel 3D cascaded CNN framework to prioritize relevant anatomy and suppress redundancies within the network. Due to the complexity and size of the network, incremental channel boosting was used to decrease memory usage and facilitate model convergence. Deep supervision was used to encourage semantically meaningful deep features and mitigate local minima traps during training. The accuracy of DAB-CNN is compared to seven architectures: a variation of U-Net (UNet), attention-enabled U-Net (A-UNet), boosted U-Net (B-UNet), deeply-supervised U-Net (D-UNet), U-Net with ResNeXt blocks (ResNeXt), life-long learning segmentation CNN (LL-CNN), and deeply supervised attention-enabled U-Net (DA-UNet). The accuracy of each method was assessed based on Dice score compared to manually delineated contours as the gold standard. One hundred and twenty patients who had definitive prostate radiotherapy were used in this study. Training, validation, and testing followed Kaggle competition rules, with 80 patients used for training, 20 patients used for internal validation, and 20 test patients used to report final accuracies. Comparator p -values indicate that DAB-CNN achieved significantly superior Dice scores than all alternative algorithms for the prostate, rectum, and penile bulb.

Our primary outcome was functional status as measured by activities of daily living. Secondary outcomes included physical component summary and mental component summary scores, which are both calculated from the Short Form 36 (SF-36) and the Veterans RAND 12-item health survey (VR-12) questionnaires. We included patients who completed 2 surveys and performed propensity score analyses to match patients 1:5 with noncancer controls. We used generalized linear mixed effects models, accounting for clustering due to insurance plan.  Results:   We identified 408 patients of whom 143 (35%) underwent conservative management, 59 (14%) underwent surgery, and 206 (51%) underwent radiation. Among conservative management and radiation patients, changes in functional status mirrored that of their noncancer controls (all P > .05). Among surgery patients, changes in activities of daily living scores were not significant, but physical component summary (mean difference = 4.5, P < .001) and mental component summary (mean difference = 3.3, P = .01) scores declined slightly more than for their noncancer peers.

Our study is to investigate predictors for treatment outcomes of lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS), nocturia, and the urinary specific quality of life (uQoL) in PCa patients one year following treatment.  Methods:   A prospective study of 131 consecutive patients was conducted with outcome measurements before treatment, at 3 months, 6 months, and one year following therapy. We utilized the International Prostate Symptom Score questionnaire to collect data. Generalized estimating equations were performed to identify predictors for major outcomes of LUTS, nocturia, and uQoL.  Results:   LUTS increased slightly over time, but nocturia and uQoL were improved from baseline to 12 months. Results of the interaction analysis indicated that patients with TNM stage 3 compared with those with stage 2 had a reduction in LUTS from diagnosis to 6 months. Patients who received surgery or radiation compared to hormone therapy had worse nocturia from diagnosis to 6 months compared to those of patients who received hormone therapy. Higher body mass index (BMI) decreased the uQoL from diagnosis to 3 months, and higher prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level deteriorated the uQoL from diagnosis to 12 months.  Conclusion:   TNM stage and BMI affected the LUTS. Patients undergone a prostatectomy or radiation therapy showed more frequency of nocturia, BMI and PSA were also risk factors for nocturia. Moreover, patients' age, BMI, and PSA affected uQoL. In such patients, we recommend close monitoring of patients' specific characteristics such as TNM stage, BMI, and PSA for a better quality of life.""","""['Saint Shiou-Sheng Chen', 'Tse-Chou Cheng', 'Li-Pin Chiu', 'Li-Yun Tasi', 'Sheng-Shiung Huang', 'Shiow-Luan Tsay']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""J Chin Med Assoc""","""['Impact of Androgen Deprivation Therapy on Volume Reduction and Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms in Patients with Prostate Cancer.', 'Improved lower urinary tract symptoms after robot-assisted radical prostatectomy: implications for survivorship, treatment selection and patient counselling.', 'EAU Guidelines on the Assessment of Non-neurogenic Male Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms including Benign Prostatic Obstruction.', 'Natural history of lower urinary tract symptoms in Japanese men from a 15-year longitudinal community-based study.', 'Management of localised prostate cancer: watchful waiting, surgery or radiation therapy, depending on the natural course, which is often relatively slow.', 'Association between overweight, obesity, and quality of life of patients receiving an anticancer treatment for prostate cancer: a systematic literature review.', 'Predictors for lower urinary tract symptoms in patients underwent radical prostatectomy: implications for postoperative nursing care.', 'Decreased biochemical progression in patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer using a novel mefenamic acid anti-inflammatory therapy: A randomized controlled trial.']"""

The purpose of this study was to assess prostate multiparametric MRI (mpMRI) before and after intervention by a director of prostate imaging. MATERIALS AND METHODS. Images from prostate mpMRI examinations at four peripheral institutions (five 1.5-T systems) were studied. DICOM headers were analyzed for T2-weighted, DWI, and dynamic contrast-enhanced technical specifications. Reports were retrieved, and a blinded radiologist compared them with those from the regional academic referral center (3-T system) and Prostate Imaging and Data Reporting System version 2 (PI-RADSv2) technical specifications. Data were reevaluated after intervention by a director of prostate imaging. Comparisons were performed by chi-square analysis. RESULTS. Except for having insufficient DWI spatial resolution, the referral center fully complied with PI-RADSv2. For peripheral systems, compliance with PI-RADSv2 technical specifications improved from baseline to after intervention. For T2-weighted imaging, compliance with spatial resolution increased from 40% (two of five MRI systems) to 100% (all five systems) (p = 0.038). For DWI, spatial resolution compliance increased from 20% to 100%. For modified DWI, spatial resolution compliance to improve image quality at 1.5 T (matrix, 100 × 100; FOV, 28 × 28 cm; slice thickness, 4 mm) increased from 60% (b value ≥ 1400 s/mm2) to 100% (p = 0.114). For dynamic contrast-enhanced imaging, spatial resolution compliance increased from 60% to 100% (p = 0.114), temporal resolution compliance increased from 20% (≤ 10 seconds) to 100% (p = 0.10), and acquisition time compliance increased from 60% (≥ 2 minutes) to 100% (p = 0.114). Only one of the four peripheral centers provided PI-RADSv2 scores, but all of them did after the intervention (p = 0.028). CONCLUSION.

Despite an impressive initial clinical response, the majority of patients eventually develop resistance to DOC. In tumor metabolism, where tumors preferentially utilize anaerobic metabolism, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) serves an important role. LDH controls the conversion of pyruvate to lactate, with LDH‑A, one of the predominant isoforms of LDH, controlling this metabolic process. In the present study, the role of LDH‑A in drug resistance of human prostate cancer (PC) was examined by analyzing 4 PC cell lines, including castration‑providing strains PC3, DU145, LNCaP and LN‑CSS (which is a hormone refractory cell line established from LNCaP). Sodium oxamate (SO) was used as a specific LDH‑A inhibitor. Changes in the expression level of LDH‑A were analyzed by western blotting. Cell growth and survival were evaluated with a WST‑1 assay. Cell cycle progression and apoptotic inducibility were evaluated by flow cytometry using propidium iodide and Annexin V staining. LDH expression was strongly associated with DOC sensitivity in PC cells. SO inhibited growth of PC cells, which was considered to be caused by the inhibition of LDH‑A expression. Synergistic cytotoxicity was observed by combining DOC and SO in LN‑CSS cells, but not in LNCaP cells. This combination treatment induced additive cytotoxic effects in PC‑3 and DU145 cells, caused cell cycle arrest in G2‑M phase and increased the number of cells in the sub‑G1 phase of cell cycle in LN‑CSS cells. SO promoted DOC induced apoptosis in LN‑CSS cells, which was partially caused by the inhibition of DOC‑induced increase in LDH‑A expression. The results strongly indicated that LDH‑A serves an important role in DOC resistance in advanced PC cells and inhibition of LDH‑A expression promotes susceptibility to DOC, particularly in CRPC cells. The present study may provide valuable information for developing targeted therapies for CRPC in the future.""","""['Hiroyuki Muramatsu', 'Makoto Sumitomo', 'Shingo Morinaga', 'Keishi Kajikawa', 'Ikuo Kobayashi', 'Genya Nishikawa', 'Yoshiharu Kato', 'Masahito Watanabe', 'Kenji Zennami', 'Kent Kanao', 'Kogenta Nakamura', 'Susumu Suzuki', 'Kazuhiro Yoshikawa']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Oncol Rep""","""['Cdc20/p55 mediates the resistance to docetaxel in castration-resistant prostate cancer in a Bim-dependent manner.', 'Effect of docetaxel on the regulation of proliferation and apoptosis of human prostate cancer cells.', 'The Effects and Mechanism of YK-4-279 in Combination with Docetaxel on Prostate Cancer.', 'Oxamate targeting aggressive cancers with special emphasis to brain tumors.', 'Exploitation of the Androgen Receptor to Overcome Taxane Resistance in Advanced Prostate Cancer.', 'Lactate as Key Metabolite in Prostate Cancer Progression: What Are the Clinical Implications?', 'Adrenomedullin induces cisplatin chemoresistance in ovarian cancer through reprogramming of glucose metabolism.', ""New horizons in modulating the radio-sensitivity of head and neck cancer - 100 years after Warburg' effect discovery."", 'Inhibition of O-GlcNAc transferase sensitizes prostate cancer cells to docetaxel.', 'Druggable Metabolic Vulnerabilities Are Exposed and Masked during Progression to Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer.']"""

Results:   The odds of detecting a GG2+ cancer was significantly higher for an upgraded 4 (peripheral zone (PZ): OR 5.06, 95%CI 2.04-12.54, p < 0.001, transitional zone (TZ): OR 3.08, 95%CI 1.04-9.08, p = 0.042) and true 4 (PZ: OR 5.82, 95%CI 3.10-10.94, p < 0.0001, TZ: OR 2.43, 95%CI 1.14-5.18, p = 0.022) lesions compared to PI-RADS 3 lesions. Additionally, we found no difference in the odds of detecting a GG2+ prostate cancer between a true PI-RADS 4 (OR 1.15, 95%CI 0.49-2.71 p = 0.746) and upgraded 4 (referent) in the PZ. Similar non-significance was noted between true 4 (OR 0.79, 95%CI 0.26-2.38 p = 0.674) and upgraded 4 lesions in the TZ for detection of GG2+ cancers.  Conclusions:   Upgraded PI-RADS 4 and true 4 targets have a higher odds of detecting GG1+ and GG2+ compared to PI-RADS 3 in the PZ and TZ.

The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in invasive breast and prostate tumors stroma were, respectively, identified. Then common stromal genes (B_P.DEGs) were further screened. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed and Gene Ontology analysis was performed. Besides, gene-chemical interactions were mapped in Comparative Toxicogenomics Database to screen the chemicals related to feature genes. The results showed that, in total, 16 B_P.DEGs were identified. Thereinto, only seven B_P.DEGs were mapped into PPI, and only four functional modules (adenylate cyclase activating polypeptide 1 (pituitary) receptor type I (ADCYAP1R1) module, aspartoacylase (ASPA) module, glutathione S-transferase mu 5 (GSTM5) module, and periplakin (PPL) module) were involved in important biological processes associated with cancer progression. In addition, the chemicals, such as dihydrotestosterone, apocarotenal, testosterone, and progesterone, were screened for the roles of feature genes in the progression of breast and prostate cancer.

Blood was collected at baseline and after two cycles of cabazitaxel from 118 mCRPC patients starting cabazitaxel in a prospective phase II trial. CellSearch-enriched CTCs were enumerated and in parallel characterized for the presence of the AR-Vs by reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Correlations with CTC and prostate-specific antigen response to cabazitaxel as well as associations with overall survival (OS) were investigated. All AR-Vs were frequently present and co-expressed at frequencies of 31-48% at baseline and at 19-40% after two cycles of cabazitaxel. No specific directions of change in the measured variants were detected between the start of treatment and after two cycles of cabazitaxel. No associations between the presence of AR-V3 and AR-V7 and outcome to cabazitaxel were observed. While a reduction in CTCs to < 5 CTCs during treatment (CTC5-response) was less often observed in patients with AR-V9-positive CTCs at baseline (P = 0.004), the CTC5-adjusted detection of AR-V1 after two cycles of cabazitaxel was an independent prognostic factor for OS [HR 2.4 (95% CI 1.1-5.1, P = 0.03)].

Nuclear localization of YBX1 has been observed in various cancer types and it's overexpression has been linked to adverse clinical outcome and poor therapy response, but no diagnostic or therapeutic correlation has been established so far. This study aimed to identify differentially expressed novel genes among the interactors of YBX1 in different cancer types. Analysis of RNA-Seq data for colorectal, lung, prostate and stomach adenocarcinoma identified 39 unique genes, which are differentially expressed in the four adenocarcinoma types. Gene-enrichment analysis for the differentially expressed genes from individual adenocarcinoma with focus on unique genes resulted in a total of 57 gene sets specific to each adenocarcinoma. Gene ontology for commonly expressed genes suggested the pathways and possible mechanisms through which they affect each adenocarcinoma type considered in the study. Gene regulatory network constructed for the common genes and network topology was analyzed for the central nodes. Here 12 genes were found to play important roles in the network formation; among them, two genes FOXM1 and TOP2A were found to be in central network formation, which makes them a common target for therapeutics.

With appropriate choice of oncological treatment and appropriate surgical management, patients may recover their physical function and maintain the previous level of quality of life. Available surgical techniques include intrame-dullary nailing, stabilisation with plates and screws and the use of modular prostheses.  Aim of the study:   to retrospectively assess the techniques and outcomes of surgical treatment of long bone metastases at the Oncology Orthopaedics Department of the Speciality Hospital in Brzozów, present the possibilities of surgical management and benefits of the chosen method and tentatively choose the most effective approach for restoring function.  Material and methods:   Between 2013 and 2017, a total of 82 patients were treated for long bone metastases at the Depart-ment of Oncological Orthopaedics. The most common cancers causing bone metastases were breast cancer (37%), myeloma (16%), lung cancer (8%), kidney (15%), prostate (8%), thyroid 4%, colon 1%, uterus 1%, with other sites accounting for 10%. Pathological fractures were diagnosed in 68 patients. Before the surgical treatment, the patients' quality of life was assessed using the Karnofsky scale, Bollen prognostic scale, severity of pain in a VAS scale, and MSTS performance scale. Metastasis morpho-logy was evaluated with conventional radiographs, CT and PET-CT. Types of surgery comprised intramedullary nailing, the use of plates and screws and the placement of modular prostheses. Patients were divided into three groups with regard to the stabi-li-sation systems used and another three related to tumour location (humerus, femur or tibia).  Results:   Post-operatively, there was a reduction of pain in the VAS scale. Function (MSTS) was best in patients treated with minimally invasive methods and modular prostheses (p &lt;0.05). An improvement in quality of life in the Karnofsky scale was also noted. The complication rate was 7% and was related to wound healing and thromboembolic complications.  Conclusions:   1. Patients with long-bone cancer metastases with pathological fractures or risk of fracture require surgical management. 2. Nailing or modular prosthesis produced the best functional result at 6 weeks post-operatively. 3. All methods of surgical treatment reduced pain and improved the quality of life.""","""['Piotr Szczerba', 'Grzegorz Guzik', 'Andrzej Bohatyrewicz', 'Daniel Kotrych']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Ortop Traumatol Rehabil""","""['Treatment of pathologic fractures of the proximal femur.', 'Oncological and functional results after surgical treatment of bone metastases at the proximal femur.', 'Early Improvement in Pain and Functional Outcome but Not Quality of Life After Surgery for Metastatic Long Bone Disease.', 'Surgical Approach to Bone Metastases.', 'Evaluation and treatment of metastases to the humerus.', 'Clinical efficacy of customized modular prosthesis in the treatment of femoral shaft metastases.', 'Trends in Diagnosis and Surgical Treatment of Bone Metastases among Orthopedic Surgeons.', 'En bloc resection and intercalary prosthesis implantation for the treatment of humeral diaphyseal bone metastases.']"""

Microsimulation models have been extensively used in the field of cancer modeling. However, there is substantial uncertainty regarding estimates from these models, for example, overdiagnosis in prostate cancer. This is usually not thoroughly examined due to the high computational effort required. Objective. To quantify uncertainty in model outcomes due to uncertainty in model parameters, using a computationally efficient emulator (Gaussian process regression) instead of the model. Methods. We use a microsimulation model of prostate cancer (microsimulation screening analysis [MISCAN]) to simulate individual life histories. We analyze the effect of parametric uncertainty on overdiagnosis with probabilistic sensitivity analyses (ProbSAs). To minimize the number of MISCAN runs needed for ProbSAs, we emulate MISCAN, using data pairs of parameter values and outcomes to fit a Gaussian process regression model. We evaluate to what extent the emulator accurately reproduces MISCAN by computing its prediction error. Results. Using an emulator instead of MISCAN, we may reduce the computation time necessary to run a ProbSA by more than 85%. The average relative prediction error of the emulator for overdiagnosis equaled 1.7%. We predicted that 42% of screen-detected men are overdiagnosed, with an associated empirical confidence interval between 38% and 48%. Sensitivity analyses show that the accuracy of the emulator is sensitive to which model parameters are included in the training runs. Conclusions. For a computationally expensive simulation model with a large number of parameters, we show it is possible to conduct a ProbSA, within a reasonable computation time, by using a Gaussian process regression emulator instead of the original simulation model.""","""['Tiago M de Carvalho', 'Eveline A M Heijnsdijk', 'Luc Coffeng', 'Harry J de Koning']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Med Decis Making""","""['Corrigendum to ""Evaluating Parameter Uncertainty in a Simulation Model of Cancer Using Emulators"".', 'Emulator-based Bayesian calibration of the CISNET colorectal cancer models.', 'A comparison of statistical emulation methodologies for multi-wave calibration of environmental models.', 'Novel statistical emulator construction for volcanic ash transport model Ash3d with physically motivated measures.', 'Digital Breast Tomosynthesis with Hologic 3D Mammography Selenia Dimensions System for Use in Breast Cancer Screening: A Single Technology Assessment Internet.', 'Calibrating Parameters for Microsimulation Disease Models: A Review and Comparison of Different Goodness-of-Fit Criteria.', 'Development and Validation of a Discrete Event Simulation Model to Evaluate the Cardiovascular Impact of Population Policies for Obesity.', 'BayCANN: Streamlining Bayesian Calibration With Artificial Neural Network Metamodeling.', 'Introduction to Metamodeling for Reducing Computational Burden of Advanced Analyses with Health Economic Models: A Structured Overview of Metamodeling Methods in a 6-Step Application Process.']"""

Methods:   This was a prospective study of 1832 men in the Age, Gene/Environment Susceptibility-Reykjavik study. From 2002 to 2006, participants underwent baseline computed tomography imaging of fat deposition, bioelectric impedance analysis, and measurement of body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference. Men were followed through linkage with nationwide cancer registries for the incidence of total (n = 172), high-grade (Gleason grade ≥8; n = 43), advanced (≥cT3b/N1/M1 at diagnosis or fatal prostate cancer over follow-up; n = 41), and fatal prostate cancer (n = 31) through 2015. Cox regression was used to evaluate the association between adiposity measures and prostate cancer outcomes.  Results:   Among all men, visceral fat (hazard ratio [HR], 1.31 per 1-standard deviation [SD] increase; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.00-1.72) and thigh subcutaneous fat (HR, 1.37 per 1-SD increase; 95% CI, 1.00-1.88) were associated with risk of advanced and fatal disease, respectively. Among men who were leaner based on BMI, visceral fat was associated with both advanced and fatal disease. BMI and waist circumference were associated with a higher risk of advanced and fatal disease. No adiposity measures were associated with total or high-grade disease.

In response, the Alberta Provincial Genitourinary Tumour Team and Cancer Control Alberta have developed self-management guidelines to aid patients with prostate cancer during this transition. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness and impact of the new provincial self-management guidelines in facilitating transition from active curative external beam radiation treatment to primary community care.  Methods:   This prospective study used convenience sampling to recruit 18 patients with prostate cancer from two major cancer centers in Alberta: Calgary and Edmonton. Participants were given the self-management guidelines within their final week of external beam radiation treatment and a follow-up phone questionnaire 4 weeks later. Participants answered standardized questions regarding the self-management document based on the themes of timeliness, patient-centeredness, safety, effectiveness, and comprehensiveness.  Results and discussion:   A thematic analysis of the results suggested that the majority of patients were satisfied with the document in all domains, but some expressed concern with the clarity of the document. They suggested improvements such as adding a side effect timeline, adding an appendix or symptom index, further simplifying the language, and coordinating delivery of the guidelines with an in-person education session.  Conclusion:   Overall, our findings supported the effectiveness of the guidelines in providing self-management information.

Objective:   To determine the pre- and postoperative prognostic value of CTC enumeration in patients undergoing CRP.  Design, setting, and participants:   Thirty-three patients with HNoMPC from the prospective, single-arm ProMPT trial who underwent CRP between 2014 and 2015 at the Martini-Klinik were evaluated. Follow-up visits for all patients were conducted every 6 mo up to 36 mo after CRP and included serial detection of CTCs in 7.5 ml blood samples using the CellSearch system.  Intervention:   CRP.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   CTC enumerations before and after CRP, and their prognostic value on metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer-free survival and overall survival (OS) were analyzed using Kaplan-Meier plots and univariable Cox-regression analysis.  Results and limitations:   Sixteen patients (48.5%) had positive CTCs prior to CRP. A CTC count of ≥2 before or 6 mo after CRP was a prognostic factor for worse oncologic outcome. Compared with other biomarkers (prostate-specific antigen, lactate dehydrogenase, and bone-specific alkaline phosphatase), the prognostic value of CTCs was highest using Harrell's C for OS (0.69), while the highest C-index could be achieved for a combination of conventional markers and CTC count (0.74). After progression to metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, CTC enumeration of ≥5 was prognostic for OS. The main limitation is the small sample size.  Conclusions:   CTC enumeration contributes to prognostic information, which might help select HNoMPC patients who might benefit most from CRP.  Patient summary:   In this report, we looked at the value of circulating tumor cell (CTC) determination in patients undergoing radical prostatectomy for oligometastatic prostate cancer. We could show that the number of CTCs was a prognostic factor at all analyzed time points and was more closely associated with prognosis than other biomarkers commonly used in daily clinical practice.""","""['Philipp C Mandel', 'Hartwig Huland', 'Anne Tiebel', 'Alexander Haese', 'Georg Salomon', 'Lars Budäus', 'Derya Tilki', 'Felix Chun', 'Hans Heinzer', 'Markus Graefen', 'Klaus Pantel', 'Sabine Riethdorf', 'Thomas Steuber']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Eur Urol Focus""","""['Clinical Significance of Mesenchymal Circulating Tumor Cells in Patients With Oligometastatic Hormone-Sensitive Prostate Cancer Who Underwent Cytoreductive Radical Prostatectomy.', 'Limited prognostic value of preoperative circulating tumor cells for early biochemical recurrence in patients with localized prostate cancer.', 'Combination of circulating tumor cell enumeration and tumor marker detection in predicting prognosis and treatment effect in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'The cytoreductive prostatectomy in metastatic prostate cancer: what the individual trials are hoping to answer.', 'Cytoreductive radical prostatectomy: who benefits from the surgical approach?', 'Perioperative change of circulating tumor cells in cytoreductive radical prostatectomy for oligometastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer: the preliminary safety evidence from long-term oncologic outcomes.', 'Detection and Molecular Characterization of Circulating Tumour Cells: Challenges for the Clinical Setting.', 'Engineering the MoS2 /MXene Heterostructure for Precise and Noninvasive Diagnosis of Prostate Cancer with Clinical Specimens.', 'An Updated Systematic and Comprehensive Review of Cytoreductive Prostatectomy for Metastatic Prostate Cancer.', 'A Systematic Review of Circulating Tumor Cells Clinical Application in Prostate Cancer Diagnosis.']"""

Recently, TRIM24 has been identified to promote androgen receptor signaling and to correlate with an aggressive prostate cancer phenotype. Based on these data, we proofed TRIM24 as a prognostic biomarker for risk stratification.  Materials and methods:   We performed TRIM24 immunohistochemistry on 2 independent cohorts including a total of 806 primary tumors, 26 locally advanced/recurrent tumors, 30 lymph node metastases, 30 distant metastases, and 129 benign prostatic samples from 497 patients as well as on 246 prostate needle biopsies. Expression data were correlated with clinic-pathological data including biochemical recurrence-free survival (bRFS) as endpoint.  Results:   Benign samples show no or low TRIM24 expression in 94%, while tumor tissues demonstrate significant higher levels. Strongest expression is observed in advanced and metastatic tumors. In multivariate analyses, TRIM24 up-regulation on radical prostatectomy specimens correlates with shorter bRFS independent of other prognostic parameters. 5-(10-) year bRFS rates for TRIM24 negative, low, medium and high expressing tumors are 93.1(93.1)%, 75.4(68.5)%, 54.9(47.5)% and 43.1(32.3)%, respectively. Of interest, tumors diagnosed as indolent disease, TRIM24 expression stratifies patients into specific risk groups. Increased TRIM24 expression associates with higher grade group, positive nodal status and extraprostatic tumor growth. TRIM24 assessment on prostate needle biopsies taken prior to treatment decision at time of initial diagnosis significantly correlates with recurrence after surgery.  Conclusion:   Using 2 large independent radical prostatectomy specimen cohorts, we found that TRIM24 expression predicts patients' risk to develop disease recurrence with high accuracy and independent from other established biomarkers. Further, this is the first study exploring TRIM24 expression on prostate needle biopsies which represents the clinically relevant tissue type on which biomarkers guide treatment decisions. Thus, we strongly suggest introducing TRIM24 evaluation in prostate needle biopsies in clinical routine as an inexpensive and simple immunohistochemical test.""","""['Anne Offermann', 'Doris Roth', 'Marie Christine Hupe', 'Silke Hohensteiner', 'Finn Becker', 'Vincent Joerg', 'Jessica Carlsson', 'Christiane Kuempers', 'Julika Ribbat-Idel', 'Lars Tharun', 'Verena Sailer', 'Jutta Kirfel', 'Maria Svensson', 'Ove Andren', 'Verena Lubczyk', 'Rainer Kuefer', 'Axel S Merseburger', 'Sven Perner']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Urol Oncol""","""['Increased mediator complex subunit CDK19 expression associates with aggressive prostate cancer.', 'MUC1 is upregulated in advanced prostate cancer and is an independent prognostic factor.', 'Expression of Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen (PSMA) on Biopsies Is an Independent Risk Stratifier of Prostate Cancer Patients at Time of Initial Diagnosis.', 'Angiogenesis, p53, bcl-2 and Ki-67 in the progression of prostate cancer after radical prostatectomy.', 'The prognostic and predictive value of TMPRSS2-ERG gene fusion and ERG protein expression in prostate cancer biopsies.', 'Genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 screen analyzed by SLIDER identifies network of repressor complexes that regulate TRIM24.', 'Circ-CREBBP inhibits sperm apoptosis via the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway by sponging miR-10384 and miR-143-3p.', 'Identification of bromodomain-containing proteins prognostic value and expression significance based on a genomic landscape analysis of ovarian serous cystadenocarcinoma.', 'TRIM24 Expression as an Independent Biomarker for Prognosis and Tumor Recurrence in HNSCC.', 'TRIM Proteins in Colorectal Cancer: TRIM8 as a Promising Therapeutic Target in Chemo Resistance.']"""

The combination (MET+SIM) inhibits tumor growth and metastasis in prostate cancer cells which possess similar molecular alterations to many early endometrial cancers. We tested the hypothesis that the anti-proliferative effects of MET+SIM in endometrial cancer cells would be greater than the effects of each agent alone.  Methods:   RL95-2, HEC1B, and Ishikawa endometrial cancer cell lines were treated with MET and/or SIM. Growth inhibition was measured by MTS cell proliferation assays. Apoptosis was evaluated by caspase-3, Annexin V, and TUNEL assays and by apoptosis markers (BAX, Bcl-2, Bim) using western blot. Bim was silenced using Bim siRNA to confirm this apoptotic pathway. Treatment effects on the mTOR pathway were investigated by western blot using antibodies to phosphorylated (phospho)-AMPK and phospho-S6.  Results:   MET+SIM synergistically inhibited growth in all three cell lines. The combination induced apoptosis as measured by TUNEL, Annexin V, and caspase-3 assays. Bim siRNA transfection abrogated this effect-silencing Bim in MET+SIM-treated RL95-2 cells rescued cell viability in MTS assays and reduced caspase-3 activity compared with control siRNA-transfected cells. Combination treatment upregulated phosphorylated AMPK and downregulated downstream phosphorylated S6, suggesting mTOR inhibition as a mechanism for these anti-proliferative effects.  Conclusions:   MET+SIM treatment synergistically inhibits endometrial cancer cell viability. This may be mediated by apoptosis and mTOR pathway inhibition.

In this study overweight or obese men treated for prostate cancer were randomised to a self-help diet and activity intervention with telephone-based dietitian support or a wait-list mini-intervention group. The intervention group had an initial group meeting, a supporting letter from their urological consultant, three telephone dietitian consultations at 4-week intervals, a pedometer and access to web-based diet and physical activity resources.

Methods:   Using Calypso trajectories from 54 patients with prostate cancer at 2 institutions, we simulated 5-field intensity-modulated radiation therapy and dual-arc volumetric-modulated arc therapy with periodic imaging at various frequencies and with continuous adaptive imaging, respectively. With manual/automatic correction, we assumed there was a 30/1 second delay after imaging to determine and apply couch shift. For adaptive imaging, real-time ""dose-free"" cine-MV images during beam delivery are used in conjunction with online-updated motion pattern information to estimate 3D displacement. Simultaneous MV-kV imaging is only used to confirm the estimated overthreshold motion and calculate couch shift, hence very low additional patient dose from kV imaging.  Results:   Without intrafraction intervention, the prostates could on average have moved out of a 3-mm margin for ∼20% of the beam-on time after setup imaging in current clinical situation. If the time interval from the setup imaging to beam-on can be reduced to only 30 seconds, the mean over-3 mm percentage can be reduced to ∼7%. For intensity-modulated radiation therapy simulation, with manual correction, 110 and 70 seconds imaging periods both reduced the mean over-3 mm time to ∼4%. Automatic correction could give another 1% to 2% improvement. However, with either manual or automatic correction, the maximum patient-specific over-3 mm time was still relatively high (from 6.4% to 12.6%) and those patients are actually clinically most important. In contrast, adaptive imaging with automatic intervention significantly reduced the mean percentage to 0.6% and the maximum to 2.7% and averagely only ∼1 kV image and ∼1 couch shift were needed per fraction. The results of volumetric-modulated arc therapy simulation show a similar trend to that of intensity-modulated radiation therapy.

A Plan Comparison Between Pinnacle Auto-Planning and Eclipse knowledge-Based RapidPlan Following a Prostate-Bed Plan Competition""","""Purpose:   Pinnacle Auto-Planning and Eclipse RapidPlan are 2 major commercial automated planning engines that are fundamentally different: Auto-Planning mimics real planners in the iterative optimization, while RapidPlan generates static dose objectives from estimations predicted based on a prior knowledge base. This study objectively compared their performances on intensity-modulated radiotherapy planning for prostate fossa and lymphatics adopting the plan quality metric used in the 2011 American Association of Medical Dosimetrists Plan Challenge.  Methods:   All plans used an identical intensity-modulated radiotherapy beam setup and a simultaneous integrated boost prescription (68 Gy/56 Gy to prostate fossa/lymphatics). Auto-Planning was used to retrospectively plan on 20 patients, which were subsequently employed as the library to build an RapidPlan model. To compare the 2 engines' performances, a test set including 10 patients and the Plan Challenge patient was planned by both Auto-Planning (master) and RapidPlan (student) without manual intervention except for a common dose normalization and evaluated using the plan quality metric that included 14 quantitative submetrics ranging over target coverage, spillage, and organ at risk doses. Plan quality metric scores were compared between the Auto-Planning and RapidPlan plans using the Mann-Whitney U test.  Results:   There was no significant difference between the overall performance of the 2 engines on the 11 test cases ( P = .509). Among the 14 submetrics, Auto-Planning and RapidPlan showed no significant difference on most submetrics except for 2. On the Plan Challenge case, Auto-Planning scored 129.9 and RapidPlan scored 130.3 out of 150, as compared with the average score of 116.9 ± 16.4 (range: 58.2-142.5) among the 125 Plan Challenge participants.  Conclusion:   Using an innovative study design, an objective comparison has been conducted between 2 major commercial automated inverse planning engines. The 2 engines performed comparably with each other and both yielded plans at par with average human planners. Using a constant-performing planner (Auto-Planning) to train and to compare, RapidPlan was found to yield plans no better than but as good as its library plans.""","""['April Smith', 'Andrew Granatowicz', 'Cole Stoltenberg', 'Shuo Wang', 'Xiaoying Liang', 'Charles A Enke', 'Andrew O Wahl', 'Sumin Zhou', 'Dandan Zheng']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Technol Cancer Res Treat""","""['Is it possible for knowledge-based planning to improve intensity modulated radiation therapy plan quality for planners with different planning experiences in left-sided breast cancer patients?', 'Clinical validation and benchmarking of knowledge-based IMRT and VMAT treatment planning in pelvic anatomy.', 'Fully automated searching for the optimal VMAT jaw settings based on Eclipse Scripting Application Programming Interface (ESAPI) and RapidPlan knowledge-based planning.', 'Barriers and facilitators to clinical implementation of radiotherapy treatment planning automation: A survey study of medical dosimetrists.', 'Artificial Intelligence in Radiotherapy Treatment Planning: Present and Future.', 'Feasibility and dosimetric evaluation of single- and multi-isocentre stereotactic body radiation therapy for multiple liver metastases.', 'Artificial Intelligence in Radiation Therapy.', 'Assessment of efficacy in automated plan generation for Varian Ethos intelligent optimization engine.', 'Knowledge-based radiation treatment planning: A data-driven method survey.', 'Evaluation of a generalized knowledge-based planning performance for VMAT irradiation of breast and locoregional lymph nodes-Internal mammary and/or supraclavicular regions.']"""

Our objective was to evaluate the treatment outcome of progressive site-directed therapy (PSDT) for oligoprogressive CRPC (OP-CRPC).  Methods and materials:   This study cohort consisted of 101 patients with CRPC who underwent whole-body diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging between 2014 and 2018, when a new line of anticancer therapy was being considered. For OP-CRPC, PSDT with radiation therapy and unchanged continuation of systemic therapy were recommended.  Results:   Thirty-eight patients received a diagnosis of OP-CRPC, and 23 (61%) underwent PSDT at a median prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level of 7.8 ng/mL. The regional radiation therapy targets were the prostate/pelvic lymph nodes (n = 7), bone (n = 15), or both (n = 1). A decrease in PSA levels of at least 50% in response to PSDT (50% PSA decline) was observed in 16 cases (70%); the median time to PSA progression was 8.7 months. Intrapelvic localization of progressive lesions was a significant predictor of time to PSA progression (hazard ratio, 6.6; P = .007) as well as volumes of abnormal signal intensity on whole-body diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (hazard ratio, 0.5; P = .045). A 50% PSA decline was achieved in 16 of the 18 patients with intrapelvic OP-CRPC (89%) and in none of the 5 patients with non-intrapelvic OP-CRPC (P < .001). Intrapelvic OP-CRPC had a significantly longer time to PSA progression than non-intrapelvic OP-CRPC (10.1 vs 4.8 months, P = .0014).

However, the therapeutic efficacy of glycolysis inhibitors is limited due to their inability to elicit cell death. Hexokinase 2 (HK2), via its mitochondrial localization, functions as a central nexus integrating glycolysis activation and apoptosis resilience. Here we identify that K63-linked ubiquitination by HectH9 regulates the mitochondrial localization and function of HK2. Through stable isotope tracer approach and functional metabolic analyses, we show that HectH9 deficiency impedes tumor glucose metabolism and growth by HK2 inhibition. The HectH9/HK2 pathway regulates cancer stem cell (CSC) expansion and CSC-associated chemoresistance.

However, most tumors progress to castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) within 18-24 months. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the mechanisms through which PCa acquires drug resistance after long-term treatment with AR antagonists. MATERIAL AND METHODS Online database analysis and bioinformatics analysis were performed to identify signaling activated during anti-androgen treatment. MTT assay was used to detect cell viability. RT-qPCR was performed to examine the mRNA expression of the indicated genes. Colony formation assay was performed to observe cell proliferation. Transwell assay was conducted to demonstrate invasive ability. Protein levels were determined by Western blot analysis and immunofluorescence assays. RESULTS An online database search and bioinformatics analysis indicated that bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)-6/SMAD signaling was activated in enzalutamide-resistant LNCaP cells. Furthermore, this signaling interaction was experimentally verified in bicalutamide- and enzalutamide-resistant LNCaP cells, which may be regulated by phospholipase C (PLC)ε and induced cell proliferation and invasion. Of note, a positive correlation was observed between PLCε and BMP-6 in CRPC tissue samples, which may promote bone metastasis and suggests a poor prognosis. CONCLUSIONS The present results suggest that targeting of PLCε/BMP-6/SMAD signaling may increase the sensitivity of CRPC to AR antagonists and inhibit tumor progression.""","""['Mengjuan Yuan', 'Yingying Gao', 'Luo Li', 'Wei Sun', 'Honglin Cheng', 'Ting Li', 'Lingfang Niu', 'Zhongbo Du', 'Zhen Quan', 'Chunli Luo', 'Xiaohou Wu']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Med Sci Monit""","""['Combination of phospholipase Cε knockdown with GANT61 sensitizes castration‑resistant prostate cancer cells to enzalutamide by suppressing the androgen receptor signaling pathway.', 'IAP Antagonists Enhance Apoptotic Response to Enzalutamide in Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer Cells via Autocrine TNF-α Signaling.', 'Study on the influence of metformin on castration-resistant prostate cancer PC-3 cell line biological behavior by its inhibition on PLCε gene-mediated Notch1/Hes and androgen receptor signaling pathway.', 'Exploitation of the Androgen Receptor to Overcome Taxane Resistance in Advanced Prostate Cancer.', 'Androgen receptor targeting drugs in castration-resistant prostate cancer and mechanisms of resistance.', 'Mechanisms of Resistance to Second-Generation Antiandrogen Therapy for Prostate Cancer: Actual Knowledge and Perspectives.', 'Atorvastatin Enhances Effects of Radiotherapy on Prostate Cancer Cells and Xenograft Tumor Mice Through Triggering Interaction Between Bcl-2 and MSH2.']"""

The purpose of the present study is to clarify the mechanism of the less than dose-proportional nonlinear pharmacokinetics of TAK-448 after subcutaneous administration to rats. The plasma pharmacokinetics of TAK-448 and radiolabeled TAK-448 ([14C]TAK-448) were examined after subcutaneous and intravenous administrations to rats. [14C]TAK-448 was also subcutaneously injected together with protease inhibitors. The effects of the protease inhibitors on the in vitro metabolism of [14C]TAK-448 were investigated using rat skin homogenates. In a dose-ascending study, less than dose-proportional nonlinear pharmacokinetics were observed after subcutaneous administration with limited absorption of TAK-448 at the highest dose level contrary to the linear pharmacokinetics following intravenous dosing, indicating enhancement of subcutaneous metabolism with dose escalation. The systemic absorption of unchanged TAK-448 recovered when protease inhibitors were subcutaneously coadministered, suggested the involvement of subcutaneous proteases in the first-pass metabolism. An in vitro metabolism study suggests that serine protease could be responsible for the subcutaneous metabolism of TAK-448. Dose-dependent enhancement of first-pass metabolism appears to contribute to the less than dose-proportional nonlinear pharmacokinetics of TAK-448 after subcutaneous administrations to rats.""","""['Yuu Moriya', 'Akifumi Kogame', 'Yoshihiko Tagawa', 'Akio Morohashi', 'Takahiro Kondo', 'Satoru Asahi', 'Leslie Z Benet']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Drug Metab Dispos""","""['Investigation of disposition for TAK-448, a synthetic peptide of kisspeptin analog, in rats and dogs using the radiolabeled TAK-448 suitable for pharmacokinetic study.', 'Pharmacologic profiles of investigational kisspeptin/metastin analogues, TAK-448 and TAK-683, in adult male rats in comparison to the GnRH analogue leuprolide.', 'Evaluation of pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics and efficacy of one-month depots of TAK-448 and TAK-683, investigational kisspeptin analogs, in male rats and an androgen-dependent prostate cancer model.', 'Sustained exposure to the investigational Kisspeptin analog, TAK-448, down-regulates testosterone into the castration range in healthy males and in patients with prostate cancer: results from two phase 1 studies.', ""Clinical pharmacokinetics of 2'-deoxy-2'-methylidenecytidine (DMDC), a deoxycytidine analogue antineoplastic agent.""]"""

We aimed to assess if preoperative mpMRI lesion score, a variable routinely available for men undergoing pre-biopsy MRI, improves the performance of commonly used preoperative predictive models for PCa recurrence.  Patients and methods:   We analyzed data from 372 patients with PCa treated with radical prostatectomy in 2012 to 2017 and assessed with pre-biopsy mpMRI within 6 months prior to surgery. Suspicious areas for cancer were scored on a standardized 5-point scale. Cox regression was used to assess the association between mpMRI score and the risk of postoperative biochemical recurrence. Two different models were tested accounting for factors included in the Kattan nomogram and in the D'Amico risk-classification.  Results:   Overall, 53% and 30% of patients were found with a lesion scored 4 or 5 at pre-biopsy mpMRI, respectively. Risk varied widely by mpMRI (29% 2-year risk of biochemical recurrence for a score of 5 vs. 5% for a score of 1-2), and mpMRI score was associated with large hazard ratios after adjusting for stage, grade, and prostate-specific antigen: 1.66, 1.96, and 2.71 for scores 3, 4, and 5, respectively. However, 95% confidence intervals were very wide (0.19-14.20, 0.26-14.65, and 0.36-20.55, respectively) and included 1.  Conclusions:   Our data did not show that preoperative models, commonly used to assess PCa risk, were improved after including the pre-biopsy mpMRI score.

High-resolution micro-ultrasound (micro-US) is a real-time US-based imaging modality that allows real-time targeted prostate biopsies using the Prostate Risk Identification Using Micro-Ultrasound risk identification protocol. We compared the diagnostic accuracy of micro-US targeted biopsies (index test) and MRI/US fusion targeted biopsies (reference standard test) in detecting clinically significant prostate cancer (csPC), defined as Gleason ≥7 disease, in a prospectively collected cohort of 104 patients with suspected PC defined according to prostate-specific antigen, digital rectal examination, and the presence of at least one Prostate Imaging-Reporting and Data System ≥3 lesion at mpMRI. PC was diagnosed in 56 patients (54%) and csPC in 35 (34%). Micro-US sensitivity for csPC detection was 94%, with 33/35 csPC cases correctly identified. The negative predictive value was 90%, while the positive predictive value was 40% and the specificity was 28%. Of the 61 targeted zones concordant between micro-US and mpMRI, 24 were csPC. Discordant targeted lesions led to csPC discovery by micro-US in three cases and mpMRI in four cases. Both techniques missed one case for which csPC was diagnosed by systematic biopsies only. PATIENT SUMMARY: According to the results of our preliminary trial, micro-ultrasound may provide additional information regarding the presence or absence of clinically significant prostate cancer (PC) in patients with suspected PC. Further studies are warranted to investigate how this new imaging modality can best be leveraged within the PC diagnostic pathway.""","""['Giovanni Lughezzani', 'Alberto Saita', 'Massimo Lazzeri', 'Marco Paciotti', 'Davide Maffei', 'Giuliana Lista', 'Rodolfo Hurle', 'Nicolò Maria Buffi', 'Giorgio Guazzoni', 'Paolo Casale']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Eur Urol Oncol""","""['Do cancer detection rates differ between transperineal and transrectal micro-ultrasound mpMRI-fusion-targeted prostate biopsies?

However, it is unclear whether simple biparametric (bp) MRI, which reduces scan sequences, time, and cost, may be an equally effective noninvasive tool for detecting and ruling out sPCa and avoiding biopsies in biopsy-naïve men.  Objective:   To assess the diagnostic accuracy, predictive values, and best biopsy strategy combining bpMRI and PSAd in detecting and ruling out sPCa (Gleason score ≥7).  Design, setting, and participants:   Assessment of 808 biopsy-naïve men with clinical suspicion of localised PCa (prostate-specific antigen <20ng/ml, rectal examination <cT3), prospectively enrolled between November 2015 and June 2017.  Intervention:   All men underwent upfront bpMRI (T2- and diffusion-weighted imaging) followed by standard and targeted biopsies of any suspicious bpMRI findings.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Various bpMRI scores and PSAd thresholds were assessed using sPCa detection rates, predictive values, and proportion of biopsies avoided. Net benefits and decision curve analyses were compared. Combined biopsies from all men were used for reference.  Results and limitations:   Significant prostate cancers were detected in 283/808 (35%) men with median age and PSA (interquartile range) of 65 yr (60-70) and 6.9ng/ml (5.4-9.5), respectively. PSAd significantly influenced the predictive values of bpMRI in detecting and ruling out sPCa. The best strategy was restricting biopsies to men with highly suspicious bpMRI findings (score ≥4) or PSAd ≥0.15ng/ml/cc. This reduced the number of men requiring biopsies by 41% (329/808) and overdiagnosis of insignificant cancers by 45% (79/177), while missing only 5% (17/329) of men with sPCa. Study limitations included single-centre analysis and combined biopsies as the reference standard.  Conclusions:   Combination of bpMRI with PSAd improves diagnostic accuracy and predictive values for sPCa detection in biopsy-naïve men. Restricting biopsies to men with highly suspicious bpMRI findings (score ≥4) or PSAd ≥0.15ng/ml/cc was the best biopsy strategy in our patient cohort, effectively balancing risks and benefits. Studies are needed to validate our findings in other patient populations.

Objective:   To identify somatic genomic aberrations associated with adverse outcome as AS protocol exclusion indicators.  Design, setting and participants:   Whole-exome sequencing profiles were generated for Gleason score (GS)=3+3 biopsies obtained from 54 PCa patients enrolled in two AS protocols. Patients were selected as representative of a nonindolent population, consisting of 27 patients who dropped out from AS due to upgrading (ie, finding of GS>3+3 at a follow-up biopsy) within 2 yr, and a potentially indolent population, consisting of 27 patients in AS for ≥4 yr without any evidence of reclassification.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   The genomic alteration landscape of core biopsies was analyzed using an integrated computational pipeline and correlated with patient reclassification due to upgrading.  Results and limitations:   Of all the GS=3+3 biopsies of the study cohort, 34% showed clear evidence of somatic copy number aberrations along the genome. Of these, 39% came from the potentially indolent and 61% from the nonindolent population. Single-nucleotide variants demonstrated low allelic fractions and included a common F133C mutation in the SPOP gene. The minimally altered genomic landscape of the study cohort presented a distinct set of monoallelic deletions, including on 8p, 13q, 16q, and 21q, and rare amplifications of 8q, which were observed in both AS patient populations. Concerning lesions typically associated with adverse outcome, PTEN deletions and MYC amplification, though observed in a small number of cases, were detected exclusively or preferentially, respectively, in nonindolent patients. Such molecular findings were confirmed by immunohistochemistry on the same tissue blocks. The small sample size and the retrospective nature of the analysis represent the main study limitations.  Conclusions:   Genomic features enriched in aggressive tumors can be detected in GS=3+3 core biopsies of AS patients.

Up to 70% of PCa patients are IDC/C-negative, but it is estimated that 20% of these cases still experience BCR. Thus, biomarkers for better detection of aggressive disease in IDC/C-negative patients are required.  Objective:   To investigate tumor-specific methylation of the transcription factor GBX2 as a novel prognosticator and predictor of BCR in PCa patients stratified by histopathologic features including IDC/C.  Design, setting, and participants:   Using genome-wide methylome profiling, we identified higher GBX2 methylation in grade group (GG) 4 tumors compared to GG1 (discovery cohort). The prognostic nature of GBX2 methylation was validated in silico using The Cancer Genome Atlas data (n=478) and a quantitative methylation assay for radical prostatectomy samples (n=254). Regulation of GBX2 methylation was investigated in prostate cells using methyl-CpG-binding domain sequencing and methylation analysis in functional knockouts of TET2, a key epigenetic player in prostate carcinogenesis.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   The association of GBX2 methylation with Gleason score (GS), pathologic stage (pT), IDC/C, and BCR was analyzed using Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney tests. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were used to predict BCR.  Results:   GBX2 methylation was associated with GS (p<0.05), pT (p<0.01), and BCR (p<0.05). GBX2 methylation (p=0.004), GS (p<0.001), pT (p=0.012), and prostate-specific antigen (p=0.005) were independent predictors of BCR. Among IDC/C-negative patients, GBX2 methylation improved prediction of BCR (p=0.002). Loss of TET2 in prostate cells resulted in greater GBX2 methylation.  Conclusions:   We identified GBX2 methylation as a novel prognostic factor in PCa and an independent predictor of BCR. We demonstrated the additive value of GBX2 methylation in predicting BCR among IDC/C-negative patients and elucidated a novel TET2-mediated upstream epigenetic regulatory mechanism of GBX2.  Patient summary:   We identified GBX2 methylation as a promising prognostic biomarker that could improve the identification of prostate cancer patients at higher risk of biochemical recurrence.""","""['Renu Jeyapala', 'Andrea J Savio', 'Ekaterina Olkhov-Mitsel', 'Shivani Kamdar', 'Fang Zhao', 'Carmelle Cuizon', 'Richard S C Liu', 'Alex Zlotta', 'Neil Fleshner', 'Theodorus van der Kwast', 'Bharati Bapat']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Eur Urol Oncol""","""['Combining CAPRA-S With Tumor IDC/C Features Improves the Prognostication of Biochemical Recurrence in Prostate Cancer Patients.', ""The influence of the presence of intraductal carcinoma of the prostate on the grade group system's prognostic performance."", 'Heterogeneous clinicopathological features of intraductal carcinoma of the prostate: a comparison between ""precursor-like"" and ""regular type"" lesions.', 'Intraductal Carcinoma of the Prostate without High-Grade Invasive Adenocarcinoma: Report of Two Cases and Review of the Literature.', 'Intraductal Carcinoma of the Prostate: Pathogenesis and Molecular Perspectives.', 'A DNA methylation-associated nomogram predicts the overall survival of osteosarcoma.', 'Genome-wide methylation sequencing identifies progression-related epigenetic drivers in myelodysplastic syndromes.', 'Advances in Prognostic Methylation Biomarkers for Prostate Cancer.', 'Somatic HOXB13 Expression Correlates with Metastatic Progression in Men with Localized Prostate Cancer Following Radical Prostatectomy.', 'Data-driven translational prostate cancer research: from biomarker discovery to clinical decision.']"""

However, the relevance of plasma AR status in the context of cabazitaxel therapy is unknown.  Patients and methods:   Between September 2011 and January 2018, pretherapy plasma samples were collected from 155 patients treated with second- or third-line cabazitaxel at standard or reduced dose in different biomarker protocols. Droplet digital polymerase chain reaction was used to identify plasma AR gain and normal samples. The primary objective was to evaluate associations of plasma AR status with treatment outcome. In an exploratory analysis, a comparison between plasma AR and treatment type was investigated by incorporating updated data from our prior study of 85 post-docetaxel patients receiving abiraterone or enzalutamide.  Results:   We observed a shorter median overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) in AR-gained compared to AR-normal patients (OS 10.5 versus 14.1 months, hazard ratio (HR) = 1.44, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.98-2.13, P = 0.064 and PFS 4.0 versus 5.0 months, HR = 1.47, 95% CI 1.05-2.07, P = 0.024). In patients with mCRPC receiving second-line therapies, a significant treatment interaction was observed between plasma AR and cabazitaxel versus AR-directed therapies for OS (P = 0.041) but not PFS (P = 0.244).

This focus is correlated with in vitro 3D tumor models ability to mimic the multicellular compact structure and spatial architecture of human solid tumors. However, these microphysiological systems generally lack the pre-existence of tumor-ECM, a critical aspect that can affect the overall therapeutic performance and the decision of advancing candidate drugs to later stages of the pipeline. Aiming to face this drawback and mimic tumors-ECM, herein we rapidly fabricated in-air hyaluronan-methacrylate (HA-MA) and gelatin-methacrylate (GelMA) photocrosslinkable 3D spheroid microgels by using superhydrophobic surfaces. These platforms were used for establishing heterotypic 3D co-culture models of prostate cancer cells (PC-3) and human osteoblasts (hOB) to mimic prostate cancer-to-bone metastasis cellular heterogeneity and the tumor-ECM microenvironment. 3D microgel microtumors morphology, size and cell number were easily controlled via digital droplet generation on polystyrene superhydrophobic surfaces and under solvent-free conditions when compared to microfluidics or electrospray. Co-culture 3D microgels formed by 2.5%HA-MA-5%GelMA and 5%HA-MA-5%GelMA ratios showed the highest calcium deposition after 14 days of culture, evidencing osteoblasts viability and the establishment of functional mineralization in the 3D hydrogel matrix. Cisplatin cytotoxicity evaluation showed that 3D microgels are more resistant to platin chemotherapeutics than single or co-culture 3D multicellular spheroid counterparts. Overall, our findings indicate that solvent-free, in-air produced 3D microgel microenvironments are cost-effective and robust tumor mimicking platforms for in vitro high-throughput screening of therapeutics targeted to prostate-to-bone metastasis microenvironments. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: The generation of robust microphysiological systems that recapitulate the complexity of the metastatic prostate-to-bone tumor microenvironment is crucial for pre-clinical evaluation of new therapeutics that can eradicate these secondary tumors. In this study, we employed superhydrophobic (SH) surfaces to rapidly fabricate photocrosslinkable hyaluronan-methacrylate/gelatin-methacrylate 3D spheroid microgels for prostate cancer cells and human osteoblasts co-culture models that simultaneously mimic the cellular and ECM tumor components. The use of SH platforms overcomes the issues of standard in-liquid microgel production technologies by providing a robust control over 3D microgels size/morphology and cell-cell co-encapsulation numbers, while avoiding the use of oil-based microgel droplets generation. Overall, SH surfaces allowed a solvent-free, cost-effective, reproducible and adaptable fabrication of heterotypic 3D spherical microgels for high throughput drug screening.""","""['Jéssica Antunes', 'Vítor M Gaspar', 'Luís Ferreira', 'Maria Monteiro', 'Rui Henrique', 'Carmen Jerónimo', 'João F Mano']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Acta Biomater""","""['Hydrogel 3D in vitro tumor models for screening cell aggregation mediated drug response.', 'Stratified 3D Microtumors as Organotypic Testing Platforms for Screening Pancreatic Cancer Therapies.', 'Design of spherically structured 3D in vitro tumor models -Advances and prospects.', 'Bioinstructive microparticles for self-assembly of mesenchymal stem Cell-3D tumor spheroids.', 'The production of 3D tumor spheroids for cancer drug discovery.', 'Heterotypic tumor spheroids: a platform for nanomedicine evaluation.', 'Recent advances in defined hydrogels in organoid research.', 'Bioprinting of hydrogel beads to engineer pancreatic tumor-stroma microtissues for drug screening.', 'Tissue-Engineered Injectable Gelatin-Methacryloyl Hydrogel-Based Adjunctive Therapy for Intervertebral Disc Degeneration.', 'Towards a New 3Rs Era in the construction of 3D cell culture models simulating tumor microenvironment.']"""

Although large randomized trials have reported the efficacy of photon-based hypofractionated therapy, hypofractionated proton therapy (HFPT) has not been extensively studied. This study was performed to determine the clinical and patient-reported outcomes for patients with PC treated with HFPT.  Methods and materials:   Between 2010 and 2017, 184 men were enrolled on a trial of 70 Gy in 28 fractions of HFPT for low- to intermediate-risk PC. Acute and late toxicity was evaluated using National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.0. Patient-reported outcomes were measured by International Prostate Symptom Score, International Index of Erectile Function Questionnaire, and Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite scores.  Results:   Median follow-up was 49.2 months. Enrolled patients had low-risk (n = 18), favorable intermediate-risk (n = 78), and unfavorable intermediate-risk (n = 88) PC. Four-year rates of biochemical-clinical failure-free survival were 93.5% (95% confidence interval, 89%-98%), 94.4% (89%-100%), 92.5% (86%-100%), and 93.8% (88%-100%) in the overall group and the low-risk, favorable intermediate-risk, and unfavorable intermediate-risk cohorts, respectively (log-rank P > .4). The incidence of acute grade 2 or higher gastrointestinal (GI) and urologic toxicities were 3.8% and 12.5%, respectively. The 4-year incidence of late grade 2 or higher urologic and GI toxicity was 7.6% (4%-13%) and 13.6% (9%-20%), respectively. One late grade 3 GI toxicity was reported. All late toxicities were transient. Patient-reported International Prostate Symptom, International Index of Erectile Function, and Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite scores had no significant long-term changes after completion of HFPT (Supplementary Table 1, available at https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijrobp.2019.05.069).

The proportion of patients not requiring treatment escalation 2 years following SBRT was 51.7% (95% CI: 44.1-59.3%). The median length of treatment escalation-free survival over the entire follow-up period was 27.1 months (95% CI; 21.8-29.4 months).

Objective:   We aimed to evaluate the impact of an mHealth reminder and education program on appointment cancellation rates, communication frequency, and patient satisfaction.  Methods:   We developed a text message (SMS, short message service)-based program with seven reminders containing links to Web-based content and surveys sent over an 18-day period (14 days before through 3 days after prostate biopsy). Messages contained educational content, reminders, and readiness questionnaires. Demographic information, appointment cancellations or change data, and patient/provider communication events were collected for 6 months before and after launching the intervention. Patient satisfaction was evaluated in the postintervention cohort.  Results:   The preintervention (n=473) and postintervention (n=359) cohorts were composed of men of similar median age and racial/ethnic distribution living a similar distance from clinic. The postintervention cohort had significantly fewer canceled or rescheduled appointments (33.8% vs 21.2%, P<.001) and fewer same-day cancellations (3.8% vs 0.5%, P<.001). There was a significant increase in preprocedural telephone calls (0.6 vs 0.8 calls per patient, P=.02) in the postintervention cohort, but not a detectable change in postprocedural calls. The mean satisfaction with the program was 4.5 out of 5 (SD 0.9).  Conclusions:   An mHealth periprocedural outreach program significantly lowered appointment cancellation and rescheduling and was associated with high patient satisfaction scores with a slight increase in preprocedural telephone calls.

During recent years, the associations of circRNA with disease have caused more and more researchers to pay attention and to analyze their correlation mechanisms. However, experimental methods for determining the associations of circRNA with a particular disease are still expensive, difficult, and time consuming. Moreover, the available databases related to circRNA-disease correlations have only recently been updated, and only a few computational methods are constructed to predict potential circRNA-disease correlations. Taking into account the limitations of experimental studies, we develop a novel computational method, named IBNPKATZ, for predicting potential circRNA-disease associations, which integrates the bipartite network projection algorithm and KATZ measure. This model is based on the known circRNA-disease associations, combining circRNA similarity and disease similarity. Specifically, the circRNA similarity is derived from the average of the semantic similarity and the Gaussian interaction profile (GIP) kernel similarity of circRNA. Similarly, disease similarity is the mean of the semantic similarity and the GIP kernel similarity of disease. Furthermore, it is semi-supervised and does not require negative samples. Finally, IBNPKATZ achieves reliable AUC of 0.9352 in the leave-one-out cross validation, and case studies show that the circRNA-disease correlations predicted by our method can be successfully demonstrated by relevant experiments. The IBNPKATZ is expected to be a useful biomedical research tool for predicting potential circRNA-disease associations.""","""['Qi Zhao', 'Yingjuan Yang', 'Guofei Ren', 'Erxia Ge', 'Chunlong Fan']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""IEEE Trans Nanobioscience""","""['GCNCDA: A new method for predicting circRNA-disease associations based on Graph Convolutional Network Algorithm.', 'PWCDA: Path Weighted Method for Predicting circRNA-Disease Associations.', 'Integrating random walk with restart and k-Nearest Neighbor to identify novel circRNA-disease association.', 'Circular RNAs and complex diseases: from experimental results to computational models.', 'Integration of Bioinformatic Predictions and Experimental Data to Identify circRNA-miRNA Associations.', 'Analysis and verification of the circRNA regulatory network RNO_CIRCpedia_ 4214/RNO-miR-667-5p/Msr1 axis as a potential ceRNA promoting macrophage M2-like polarization in spinal cord injury.', 'Screening potential lncRNA biomarkers for breast cancer and colorectal cancer combining random walk and logistic matrix factorization.', 'MSPCD: predicting circRNA-disease associations via integrating multi-source data and hierarchical neural network.', 'Prioritizing potential circRNA biomarkers for bladder cancer and bladder urothelial cancer based on an ensemble model.', 'circGPA: circRNA functional annotation based on probability-generating functions.']"""

More recently, exosome proteomics dissected protein cargo in the lumen and at the surface of EVs, and unexpectedly indicated that RNA- and DNA-binding proteins might also be present on vesicular surfaces. Here, we analyse MS-based proteomic data on urinary exosomes from cancer patients, and discuss the potential of urinary exosome-derived biomarkers in cancer.""","""['Leyla Ayse Erozenci', 'Franziska Böttger', 'Irene V Bijnsdorp', 'Connie R Jimenez']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""FEBS Lett""","""['Urinary extracellular microvesicles: isolation methods and prospects for urinary proteome.', 'Proteomic Analysis of Exosomes for Discovery of Protein Biomarkers for Prostate and Bladder Cancer.', 'Identifying Urinary and Serum Exosome Biomarkers for Radiation Exposure Using a Data Dependent Acquisition and SWATH-MS Combined Workflow.', 'Human Plasma Extracellular Vesicle Isolation and Proteomic Characterization for the Optimization of Liquid Biopsy in Multiple Myeloma.', 'Emerging MS-based platforms for the characterization of tumor-derived exosomes isolated from human biofluids: challenges and promises of MudPIT.', 'Liquid Biopsy at the Frontier of Kidney Diseases: Application of Exosomes in Diagnostics and Therapeutics.', 'Urinary exosome proteomic profiling defines stage-specific rapid progression of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease and tolvaptan efficacy.', 'Importance and implications of exosomes in nephrology and urology.', 'The Role of Genomics and Proteomics in Lung Cancer Early Detection and Treatment.', 'Alpha-2-macroglobulin as a novel diagnostic biomarker for human bladder cancer in urinary extracellular vesicles.']"""

Here we show that the mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC), a critical metabolic conduit linking cytosolic and mitochondrial metabolism, is transcriptionally regulated by AR. Experimental MPC inhibition restricts proliferation and metabolic outputs of the citric acid cycle (TCA) including lipogenesis and oxidative phosphorylation in AR-driven PCa models. Mechanistically, metabolic disruption resulting from MPC inhibition activates the eIF2α/ATF4 integrated stress response (ISR). ISR signaling prevents cell cycle progression while coordinating salvage efforts, chiefly enhanced glutamine assimilation into the TCA, to regain metabolic homeostasis. We confirm that MPC function is operant in PCa tumors in-vivo using isotopomeric metabolic flux analysis. In turn, we apply a clinically viable small molecule targeting the MPC, MSDC0160, to pre-clinical PCa models and find that MPC inhibition suppresses tumor growth in hormone-responsive and castrate-resistant conditions.

A total of 95 circRNAs and 830 mRNAs were screened to be significantly differentially expressed in PCa tissues by microarrays. Co-expression and competitive endogenous RNA (ceRNA) network were constructed to reveal the potential regulatory mechanisms of circRNAs. Three circRNAs, hsa_circ_0001206, hsa_circ_0001633, and hsa_circ_0009061 were validated to be down-regulated in PCa by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) and hsa_circ_0001206 as well as hsa_circ_0009061 was significantly associated with clinical features of PCa patients. Meanwhile, Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves showed their good diagnostic value as biomarkers for PCa. The down-regulation of hsa_circ_001206 was partly because of the regulation of DExH-Box Helicase 9 (DHX9). Moreover, overexpression of hsa_circ_0001206 inhibited PCa cell proliferation, migration, and invasion in vitro and prevented tumor growth in vivo. Dual-luciferase reporter assays showed hsa_circ_0001206 could directly bind to miR-1285-5p. The expression of Smad4, a well-known suppressive gene in PCa, can be increased by overexpression of hsa_circ_0001206 and this effect could be partly reversed by co-transfection of miR-1285-5p mimic.

The resulting BEZ-NPs displayed a regularly spherical form with an appropriate diameter at 76.0 ± 3.6 nm.

PHBHHx NPs presented significantly improved cellular uptake in human prostate cancer cell line PC3, thereby enhancing the antiproliferation ability and kinase inhibitory activity of BEZ in vitro. More importantly, the in vivo real-time imaging demonstrated the adequate tumor targeting and accumulation capability of PHBHHx NPs. The remarkably delayed tumor growth, increased tumor necrosis, and reduced tumor proliferation in PC3 tumor xenograft mice further confirmed the antitumor efficacies of BEZ-loaded PHBHHx NPs.

We performed a quantitative analysis on two tractographic parameters, fractional anisotropy (FA) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and computed the ratio between the lesion quadrant and its contralateral (L/H ratio). We compared L/H ratios of patients with and without ECE; ROC analyses were performed to determinate ECE cut-off values of tractographic parameters.

We found that GLS was significantly up-regulated in PCa tissues and cell lines. High expression of GLS was significantly associated with Gleason score (P=0.001) and Tumor stage (P=0.015). Functionally, we silenced GLS in PCa cell lines and revealed that GLS knockdown largely blunted the proliferation of DU145 and PC-3 cells. Mechanistically, we demonstrated that knockdown of GLS induced apoptosis and cell cycle arrest. Moreover, we observed that the expressions of Bax were increased while the levels of cyclinD1 and Bcl-2 were decreased after knockdown of GLS in PCa cells.

Aim:   To survey the prevalence of low sexual desire in a population-based sample of 45-year-old German men and to evaluate associations with a broad set of factors.  Methods:   Data were collected between April 2014-April 2016 within the German Male Sex-Study. Participants were asked to fill out questionnaires about 6 sociodemographic, 5 lifestyle, and 8 psychosocial factors, as well as 6 comorbidities and 4 factors of sexual behavior. Simple and multiple logistic regressions were used to assess potential explanatory factors.  Main outcome measures:   We found a notable prevalence of low sexual desire in middle-aged men and detected associations with various factors.  Results:   12,646 men were included in the analysis, and prevalence of low sexual desire was 4.7%. In the multiple logistic regression with backward elimination, 8 of 29 factors were left in the final model. Men having ≥2 children, higher frequency of solo-masturbation, perceived importance of sexuality, and higher sexual self-esteem were less likely to have low sexual desire. Premature ejaculation, erectile dysfunction, and lower urinary tract symptoms were associated with low sexual desire.  Clinical implications:   Low sexual desire is common in middle-aged men, and associating factors that can potentially be modified should be considered during assessment and treatment of sexual desire disorders.  Strengths & limitations:   The strength of our study is the large, population-based sample of middle-aged men and the broad set of assessed factors. However, because of being part of a prostate cancer screening trial, a recruiting bias is arguable.  Conclusion:   Our study revealed that low sexual desire among 45-year-old men is a common sexual dysfunction, with a prevalence of nearly 5% and might be affected by various factors, including sociodemographic and lifestyle factors, as well as comorbidities and sexual behavior.

However, head-to-head studies comparing oncologic outcomes and survival between these 2 treatment strategies are warranted. The objective of this study was to compare the use of prostate cancer treatments and PCa death in men managed on AS and men who underwent immediate RP.  Patients and methods:   This was an observational study including 647 men on AS and 647 men treated with RP propensity score matched. We examined the 10-year cumulative incidence of salvage radiotherapy, hormonal therapy, castration-resistant PCa, and PCa death.  Results:   The 10-year curative treatment-free survival for men on AS was 61% (95% confidence interval [CI], 57%-65%). No differences in use of salvage radiotherapy (AS, 2.7%; 95% CI, 1.4%-4.1% vs. RP 5.4%; 95% CI, 3.4%-7.3%), hormonal therapy (AS, 6.9%; 95% CI, 4.4%-9.4% vs. RP, 4.1%; 95% CI, 2.5%-5.6%), developing castration-resistant PCa (AS, 1.7%; 95% CI, 0.5%-2.9% vs. RP, 2.0%; 95% CI, 0.7%-3.4%), or cumulative PCa mortality (AS, 0.4%; 95% CI, 0%-1.0% vs. RP, 0.5%; 95% CI, 0%-1.5%) were observed between the treatment strategies. The main limitation was the non-random allocation to treatment strategy.  Conclusion:   In this observational study on men with favorable-risk localized PCa, we found similar PCa mortality at 10 years between men on AS and men who underwent immediate RP.

Its overexpression promoted proliferation of the prostate cancer cell line, LNCaP, as determined by MTT, colony formation and soft agar growth assays. Consistently, knockdown of miR-3648 inhibited LNCaP proliferation. The tumor suppressor, adenomatous polyposis coli 2 (APC2), which negatively regulates the Wnt/β-catenin pathway, was the target of miR-3648. The results of the luciferase reporter assay suggested that miR-3648 binds directly to the 3'UTR of APC2. The Wnt/β-catenin pathway promotes G1/S transition. We evaluated whether miR-3648 regulated the expression of key regulatory proteins involved in G1/S transition, and found that miR-3648 promoted cyclin D1 and cyclin E1 expression while inhibiting p21 expression. This suggested that miR-3648 promoted LNCaP proliferation by targeting APC2, which in turn activates the Wnt/β-catenin pathway to produce the observed effects on cyclin D1, cyclin E1 and p21 expression.

This is followed by two additional months of placebo/enzalutamide.  Discussion:   The SALV-ENZA trial is the first phase II placebo-controlled double-blinded randomized study to test SRT in combination with a next generation androgen receptor antagonist in men with high-risk recurrent prostate cancer after radical prostatectomy. The primary hypothesis of this study is that clinical outcomes will be improved by the addition of enzalutamide compared to standard-of-care SRT alone and pave the path for phase III evaluation of this combination.

However, the design of precision medicine tests for unmet clinical needs from this information in the small cohorts available for test discovery remains a challenging task. Obtaining reliable performance assessments at the earliest stages of test development can also be problematic. We describe a novel approach to classifier development designed to create clinically useful tests together with reliable estimates of their performance. The method incorporates elements of traditional and modern machine learning to facilitate the use of cohorts where the number of samples is less than the number of measured patient attributes. It is based on a hierarchy of classification and information abstraction and combines boosting, bagging, and strong dropout regularization.  Results:   We apply this dropout-regularized combination approach to two clinical problems in oncology using mRNA expression and associated clinical data and compare performance with other methods of classifier generation, including Random Forest. Performance of the new method is similar to or better than the Random Forest in the two classification tasks used for comparison. The dropout-regularized combination method also generates an effective classifier in a classification task with a known confounding variable. Most importantly, it provides a reliable estimate of test performance from a relatively small development set of samples.  Conclusions:   The flexible dropout-regularized combination approach is able to produce tests tailored to particular clinical questions and mitigate known confounding effects. It allows the design of molecular diagnostic tests addressing particular clinical questions together with reliable assessment of whether test performance is likely to be fit-for-purpose in independent validation at the earliest stages of development.""","""['Joanna Roder', 'Carlos Oliveira', 'Lelia Net', 'Maxim Tsypin', 'Benjamin Linstid', 'Heinrich Roder']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""BMC Bioinformatics""","""['NCC-AUC: an AUC optimization method to identify multi-biomarker panel for cancer prognosis from genomic and clinical data.', 'A Machine Learning Ensemble Classifier for Early Prediction of Diabetic Retinopathy.', 'A transfer learning approach via procrustes analysis and mean shift for cancer drug sensitivity prediction.', 'Translational Metabolomics of Head Injury: Exploring Dysfunctional Cerebral Metabolism with Ex Vivo NMR Spectroscopy-Based Metabolite Quantification.', 'Patient Similarity Networks for Precision Medicine.', 'Semi-Quantitative MALDI Measurements of Blood-Based Samples for Molecular Diagnostics.', 'Predicting prognosis in COVID-19 patients using machine learning and readily available clinical data.', 'Explaining multivariate molecular diagnostic tests via Shapley values.', 'Detection of Hepatocellular Carcinoma in a High-Risk Population by a Mass Spectrometry-Based Test.', 'Robust Distance Measures for kNN Classification of Cancer Data.']"""

V. (http://www.prostata-ca.net) and contains data on pre-, peri- and postoperative parameters of radical prostatectomy documented since January 2005. With its user-friendly interface and its integrated benchmarking tool, the main goal of Onkonet was to outline and improve the surgical care of prostate cancer patients in Germany. This study aimed to analyse all Onkonet data documented from the beginning of the project until June 2018. We focused on the completeness and plausibility of data to investigate and define the possibilities and limits of further analyses.  Patients and methods:   All patients who underwent radical prostatectomy in one of the urological clinics participating in this project until June 2018 were included in this retrospective study. The completeness of all documented patient data was analysed using Excel 2013. The statistical analysis was descriptive.  Results:   A total of 21 474 patients were documented in Onkonet. 58,6 % (12 591) of them had a complete dataset including date of birth, date of surgery, dates of hospitalisation and discharge, initial PSA value, Gleason score of the biopsy, clinical T stage, pathological T stage, pathological Gleason score, as well as information on the surgical technique. Mean completeness of pre-operative parameters was 26,8 %, of hospitalisation parameters 64,5 %, and of pathological parameters 58,1 %. Amongst these, the documentation of the pathological T stage was complete in 80,1 %, documentation of N stage in 78,8 %, of M stage in 74,8 %, of pathological Gleason Score in 78,7 %, and of R1 status in 78,7 %. Completeness of follow-up data was 8,1 %, with PSA data being available in 27,2 %, continence data in 23,0 %, and potency data in 13,9 %.  Conclusions:   Comprising 21 474 documented patients and over 200 parameters, Onkonet is one of the most comprehensive clinical registers for the documentation of prostate cancer patients in Germany.

The increase in the biosensor's impedance after sample incubation was indicative of lectin recognition and complex formation between PNA and glycoproteins containing T antigen. When using asialofetuin as model glycoprotein, a minimum amount of 100 ng of glycoprotein could be detected, generating an increase in impedance of 7.2%. Albumin did not cause interference in the detection of T-carrying glycoproteins up to a concentration of 0.01 mg ml-1. The biosensor was used to evaluate the T-antigen expression in serum samples and was able to discriminate between control samples (of individuals without cancer) and case samples from patients with diverse types of carcinomas (skin, colon, breast, prostate, stomach, kidney, lung, liver and rectum) in which an increase in the expression of T antigen is well-known. The same samples were analyzed with a Vicia villosa agglutinin biosensor that has specificity for the cancer-associated Tn antigen, to compare the expression of both antigens in the diverse carcinomas. The results were different for both biosensors, confirming that the use of different lectins allows to monitor different antigen expression. Furthermore, combining different lectins, glycosylation profiles for each carcinoma type can be obtained. This work demonstrates the feasibility of employing PNA to selectively recognize the T epitope in glycoproteins and the proposed biosensor could be used for high-throughput, label-free profiling of the cancer-associated T antigen in serum samples.""","""['María G H Rangel', 'M Luísa S Silva']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Biosens Bioelectron""","""['Construction and validation of a Sambucus nigra biosensor for cancer-associated STn antigen.', 'Peanut (Arachis hypogaea) lectin recognizes alpha-linked galactose, but not N-acetyl lactosamine in N-linked oligosaccharide terminals.', 'Differential reactivities of the Arachis hypogaea (peanut) and Vicia villosa B4 lectins with human ovarian carcinoma cells, grown either in vitro or in vivo xenograft model.', 'The pathogenetic importance of peanut lectin binding sites in infectious, toxic and neoplastic processes.', 'Plant Lectins Targeting O-Glycans at the Cell Surface as Tools for Cancer Diagnosis, Prognosis and Therapy.', 'On Demand Biosensors for Early Diagnosis of Cancer and Immune Checkpoints Blockade Therapy Monitoring from Liquid Biopsy.', 'A Quest for New Cancer Diagnosis, Prognosis and Prediction Biomarkers and Their Use in Biosensors Development.']"""

The pivotal roles that miRNA expression plays, make them ideal candidates for detection of cancer progression as well as cancer metastasis. Especially for breast, lung and prostate cancer which are originated from soft tissues and prone to metastasis. Thus, the aim of this study is to evaluate the expression level of miR-145-3p which is a shared potential biomarker identified by meta-analysis of breast, prostate and lung cancer data sets. Six different data sets representative of three different cancer types were analyzed. These data sets are pooled together to have a master metamiRNA list while getting rid of the platform differentiations between them. As a result, 24 common differentially expressed miRNAs are determined in which miR-145-3p has the topmost rank. To mimic in vivo cancer microenvironment, hypoxia and serum deprivation were used to induce metastasis in breast (MCF-7, MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-453), prostate (PC3, LNCaP, DU145), lung (A549, NCIH82,) cancer cell lines and noncancerous cell lines of the coresponding tissues (MCF10A, RWPE-1, MRC-5). miR-145-3p expression levels were determined by qRT-PCR. It has been shown that it is down regulated by the induction of metastasis in cancer cell lines while it is up regulated in normal cell lines to suppress the tumor formation. As a conclusion, as representing the same results in three different cancer cell types, miR-145-3p will be a promising biomarker to follow up its expression to detect cancer metastasis.""","""['Gizem Örs Kumoğlu', 'Mert Döşkaya', 'Sultan Gulce Iz']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Gene""","""['MicroRNA-455-3p promotes invasion and migration in triple negative breast cancer by targeting tumor suppressor EI24.', 'MicroRNA-494-3p targets CXCR4 to suppress the proliferation, invasion, and migration of prostate cancer.', 'Differential expression profiles of microRNAs as potential biomarkers for the early diagnosis of lung cancer.', 'The potential of microRNAs as human prostate cancer biomarkers: A meta-analysis of related studies.', 'Functional Role of microRNA-23b-3p in Cancer Biology.', 'MiR-21 Is Induced by Hypoxia and Down-Regulates RHOB in Prostate Cancer.', 'CASC11 promotes aggressiveness of prostate cancer cells through miR-145/IGF1R axis.', 'miRNA Expression Profiles in Luminal A Breast Cancer-Implications in Biology, Prognosis, and Prediction of Response to Hormonal Treatment.', 'Circulating exosomal microRNAs as novel potential detection biomarkers in pancreatic cancer.']"""

Inefficient autophagy in nutrient-deprived cancer cells would be beneficial for cancer therapy making its modulation valuable as a therapeutic strategy for cancer treatment, especially in combination with chemotherapy. Dipyridamole (DIP) is a vasodilator and antithrombotic drug. Its major effects involve the block of nucleoside uptake and phosphodiestesase inhibition, leading to increased levels of intracellular cAMP. Here we report that DIP increases autophagic markers due to autophagic flux blockage, resembling autophagosome maturation and/or closure impairment. Treatment with DIP results in an increased number of autophagosomes and autolysosomes and impairs degradation of SQSTM1/p62. As blockage of autophagic flux decreases the recycling of cellular components, DIP reduced the intracellular ATP levels in cancer cells. Autophagic flux blockage was neither through inhibition of lysosome function nor blockage of nucleoside uptake, but could be prevented by treatment with a PKA inhibitor, suggesting that autophagic flux failure mediated by DIP results from increased intracellular levels of cAMP. Treatment with DIP presented antiproliferative effects in vitro alone and in combination with chemotherapy drugs. Collectively, these data demonstrate that DIP can impair autophagic degradation, by preventing the normal autophagosome maturation, and might be useful in combination anticancer therapy.""","""['Marcos P Thomé', 'Luiza C Pereira', 'Giovana R Onzi', 'Francieli Rohden', 'Mariana Ilha', 'Fátima T Guma', 'Márcia R Wink', 'Guido Lenz']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Exp Cell Res""","""['Autophagic flux disruption contributes to Ganoderma lucidum polysaccharide-induced apoptosis in human colorectal cancer cells via MAPK/ERK activation.', 'Impaired autophagic flux is associated with the severity of trauma and the role of A2AR in brain cells after traumatic brain injury.', 'Autophagic flux determines cell death and survival in response to Apo2L/TRAIL (dulanermin).', 'Evolution of tools and methods for monitoring autophagic flux in mammalian cells.', 'Targeting cancer cells through autophagy for anticancer therapy.', 'Dipyridamole enhances the anti-cancer ability of aspirin against colorectal cancer by inducing apoptosis in an unfolded protein response-dependent manner.', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress Contributed to Dipyridamole-Induced Impaired Autophagic Flux and Glioma Apoptosis.', 'Thymoquinone Suppresses the Proliferation, Migration and Invasiveness through Regulating ROS, Autophagic Flux and miR-877-5p in Human Bladder Carcinoma Cells.', 'Export of RNA-derived modified nucleosides by equilibrative nucleoside transporters defines the magnitude of autophagy response and Zika virus replication.', 'Exosomal HMGB1 Promoted Cancer Malignancy.']"""

We aimed to investigate the associations between PSA and age and the risk of ISUP 1 and ISUP ≥ 2 prostate cancer, respectively.  Methods:   We included 6 083 men aged 50-69 biopsied with a total of 72 996 individual biopsy cores from the prospective and population based Stockholm3 diagnostic study. We computed the risk of ISUP 1 and ISUP ≥ 2 prostate cancer and their respective associations with PSA and age. Since lower Gleason grades often are masked by higher grades in the overall Gleason score, we compared associations both for overall Gleason score and for Gleason on individual biopsy cores.  Results:   ISUP 1 prostate cancer was not significantly associated with PSA at diagnosis: odds ratios ranged from 0.82 (95%CI: 0.68-1.00) for PSA 3-4 ng/mL, 0.96 (95%CI: 0.79-1.16) for PSA 4-6 ng/mL, 0.95 (95%CI: 0.75-1.21) for PSA 6-10 ng/mL, and 0.92 (95%CI: 0.58-1.45) for PSA 10-15 ng/mL compared with PSA 2-3 ng/mL. Age was not significantly associated with risk of ISUP 1 cancer. This contrasts to the strong relationship between ISUP ≥ 2 prostate cancer and its respective associations with PSA and age.

Knowledge embedding models have been found to have value in detecting knowledge-based correlations among entities, but little effort has been made to apply them to networks of biochemical entities. This is because such networks tend to be unbalanced and sparse, and knowledge embedding models do not work well on them. However, to some extent, the shortcomings of knowledge embedding models can be compensated for if they are used in association with graph embedding. In this paper, we combine knowledge embedding and graph embedding to represent biochemical entities and their relations as dense and low-dimensional vectors. We build a cascade learning framework which incorporates semantic features from the knowledge embedding model, and graph features from the graph embedding model, to score the probability of linking. The proposed method performs noticeably better than the models with which it is compared. It predicted links and entities with an accuracy of 93%, and its average hits@10 score has an average of 8.6% absolute improvement compared with original knowledge embedding model, 1.1% to 9.7% absolute improvement compared with other knowledge and graph embedding algorithm. In addition, we designed a meta-path algorithm to detect path relations in the biomedical network. Case studies further verify the value of the proposed model in finding potential relationships between diseases, drugs, genes, treatments, etc. Amongst the findings of the proposed model are the suggestion that VDR (vitamin D receptor) may be linked to prostate cancer. This is backed by evidence from medical databases and published research, supporting the suggestion that our proposed model could be of value to biomedical researchers.""","""['Xiaomin Liang', 'Daifeng Li', 'Min Song', 'Andrew Madden', 'Ying Ding', 'Yi Bu']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Exploiting semantic patterns over biomedical knowledge graphs for predicting treatment and causative relations.', 'edge2vec: Representation learning using edge semantics for biomedical knowledge discovery.', 'A Method to Learn Embedding of a Probabilistic Medical Knowledge Graph: Algorithm Development.', 'Path-based knowledge reasoning with textual semantic information for medical knowledge graph completion.', 'Biological applications of knowledge graph embedding models.', 'From language models to large-scale food and biomedical knowledge graphs.', 'A novel multiple kernel fuzzy topic modeling technique for biomedical data.', 'Understanding Drug Repurposing From the Perspective of Biomedical Entities and Their Evolution: Bibliographic Research Using Aspirin.']"""

This study reports the impact of landmark trials and updated recommendations on the incidence rate of prostate cancer screening by Swiss general practitioners.  Methods:   We performed a retrospective analysis of primary care data, separated in 3 time periods based on dates of publications of important prostate-specific antigen screening recommendations. 1: 2010-mid 2012 including 2 updates; 2: mid 2012-mid 2014 including a Smarter Medicine recommendation; 3: mid-2014-mid-2017 maintenance period. Period 2 including the Smarter Medicine recommendation was defined as reference period. We further assessed the influence of patient's age and the number of prostate-specific-antigen (PSA) tests, by the patient and within each time period, on the mean PSA concentration. Uni- and multivariable analyses were used as needed.  Results:   36,800 men aged 55 to 75 years were included. 14.6% had ≥ 2 chronic conditions, 11.7% had ≥ 1 prostate-specific antigen test, (mean 2.60 ng/ml [SD 12.3]). 113,921 patient-years were covered. Data derived from 221 general practitioners, 33.5% of GP were women, mean age was 49.4 years (SD 10.0), 67.9% used prostate-specific antigen testing. Adjusted incidence rate-ratio (95%-CI) dropped significantly over time periods: Reference Period 2: incidence rate-ratio 1.00; Period 1: incidence rate-ratio 1.74 (1.59-1.90); Period 3: incidence rate-ratio 0.61 (0.56-0.67). A higher number of chronic conditions and a patient age between 60-69 years were significantly associated with higher screening rate. Increasing numbers of PSA testing per patient, as well as increasing age, were independently and significantly associated with an increase in the PSA value.  Conclusion:   Swiss general practitioners adapted screening behavior as early as evidence of a limited health benefit evolved, while using a risk-adapted approach whenever performing multiple testing. Updated recommendations might have helped to maintain this decrease. Further recommendations and campaigns should aimed at older patients with multimorbidity, to sustain a further decline in prostate-specific antigen screening practices.""","""['Stefan Zechmann', 'Stefania Di Gangi', 'Vladimir Kaplan', 'Rahel Meier', 'Thomas Rosemann', 'Fabio Valeri', 'Oliver Senn;FIRE Study Group']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['PSA screening, prostate biopsy, and treatment of prostate cancer in the years surrounding the USPSTF recommendation against prostate cancer screening.', 'Changes in Prostate-Specific Antigen Testing Relative to the Revised US Preventive Services Task Force Recommendation on Prostate Cancer Screening.', 'Prostate cancer screening using prostate-specific antigen: The views of general and laboratory physicians.', 'Early detection of prostate cancer: European Association of Urology recommendation.', 'Screening for prostate cancer with the prostate-specific antigen test: a review of current evidence.', 'Variation of colorectal, breast and prostate cancer screening activity in Switzerland: Influence of insurance, policy and guidelines.']"""

Recent advances in genomics and next-generation sequencing heralded the discovery of biomarkers such as the androgen receptor gene (AR) splice events, the TMPRSS2:EGR gene fusion, long noncoding RNA MALAT-1 and SCHLAP1 for PCa prognosis. Still, the question of why some patients experience recurrence, whereas others do not introduce marked uncertainty for both patients and physicians. We report here the whole exome sequencing of 30 recurrent and 44 nonrecurrent PCa patients.

This study was aimed on evaluating the cytotoxicity activities of Asparagus laricinus Burch. and Senecio asperulus DC. Main methods: In vitro cytotoxicity screening was carried out using fluorescent cellular stains on human prostate cancer (PC3), human breast cancer (MCF-7) and the non-cancerous African green monkey kidney (Vero) cell lines. The cells were imaged with the ImageXpress Micro XLS Widefield fluorescent Microscope, and the acquired images were analysed using the MetaXpress software and the Multi-Wavelength cell scoring application module. Melphalan was used as a positive control in all experiments.  Key findings: Asparagus laricinus methanol and Senecio asperulus DC. dichloromethane extracts exhibited cytotoxicity activity against breast cancer cells with IC50 values of 97.6 μg/mL and 69.15 μg/mL, respectively. Cell cycle analysis suggested that Asparagus laricinus methanol extract induced cell death selectively through apoptosis observed from Annexin V-FITC and PI stain. Cell cycle analysis also showed that Senecio asperulus DC. dichloromethane extracts induced breast cancer cells death through cell arrest at the synthesis phase and G2 phase. Senecio asperulus DC. dichloromethane extracts further showed cytotoxicity activity against prostate cancer cells with IC50 values of 69.25 μg/mL due to cell arrest at the G2 and early mitotic (G2/M) phase.  Significance:   We, therefore, propose that the methanol extract of Asparagus laricinus is a suitable aspirant for future breast cancer chemotherapeutic drug, due to its selective cytotoxicity on cancer cells and not on non-cancerous cells.""","""['P H Mfengwana', 'S S Mashele', 'I T Manduna']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Heliyon""","""['Crude Methanol Extract of Rosin Gum Exhibits Specific Cytotoxicity against Human Breast Cancer Cells via Apoptosis Induction.', 'The selective cytotoxicity elicited by phytochemical extract from Senecio graveolens (Asteraceae) on breast cancer cells is enhanced by hypoxia.', 'Biological Activity, Apoptotic Induction and Cell Cycle Arrest of New Hydrazonoyl Halides Derivatives.', 'Evaluation of the cytotoxicity, cell-cycle arrest, and apoptotic induction by Euphorbia hirta in MCF-7 breast cancer cells.', 'Induction of cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in caspase-3 deficient MCF-7 cells by Dillenia suffruticosa root extract via multiple signalling pathways.', 'In Vitro Cytotoxic Activity of African Plants: A Review.', 'Combining Network Pharmacology and Experimental Validation to Study the Action and Mechanism of Water extract of Asparagus Against Colorectal Cancer.', 'Anticancer Activity of Aqueous Extracts from Asparagus officinalis L.

However, their clinical use is commonly limited by instability and low tissue distribution. EGCG and CU combined treatment can improve the efficacy with synergistic effects. To improve the synergistic effect and overcome the limitations of low tissue distribution, we applied a dual cancer-targeted nanoparticle system to co-deliver EGCG and CU. Nanoparticles were composed of hyaluronic acid, fucoidan, and poly(ethylene glycol)-gelatin to encapsulate EGCG and CU. Furthermore, a dual targeting system was established with hyaluronic acid and fucoidan, which were used as agents for targeting CD44 on prostate cancer cells and P-selectin in tumor vasculature, respectively. Their effect and efficacy were investigated in prostate cancer cells and a orthotopic prostate tumor model. The EGCG/CU-loaded nanoparticles bound to prostate cancer cells, which were uptaken more into cells, leading to a better anticancer efficiency compared to the EGCG/CU combination solution. In addition, the releases of EGCG and CU were regulated by their pH value that avoided the premature release. In mice, treatment of the cancer-targeted EGCG/CU-loaded nanoparticles significantly attenuated the orthotopic tumor growth without inducing organ injuries. Overall, the dual-targeted nanoparticle system for the co-delivery of EGCG and CU greatly improved its synergistic effect in cancer therapy, indicating its great potential in developing treatments for prostate cancer therapy.""","""['Pei-Yi Chu', 'Shih-Chang Tsai', 'Han-Yu Ko', 'Chia-Che Wu', 'Yu-Hsin Lin']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""ACS Appl Mater Interfaces""","""['Correction to Codelivery of Natural Compounds with a Dual-Targeted Nanoparticle Delivery System for Improving Synergistic Therapy in an Orthotopic Tumor Model.', 'Multifunctional nanoparticles for targeting the tumor microenvironment to improve synergistic drug combinations and cancer treatment effects.', 'The Development of Hyaluronan/Fucoidan-Based Nanoparticles as Macrophages Targeting an Epigallocatechin-3-Gallate Delivery System.', 'Synergistic effect of curcumin on epigallocatechin gallate-induced anticancer action in PC3 prostate cancer cells.', 'Targeting cancer with nano-bullets: curcumin, EGCG, resveratrol and quercetin on flying carpets.', 'Effects of the Green Tea Polyphenol Epigallocatechin-3-Gallate on Glioma: A Critical Evaluation of the Literature.', 'A hybrid nanopharmaceutical for specific-amplifying oxidative stress to initiate a cascade of catalytic therapy for pancreatic cancer.', 'Reports of Plant-Derived Nanoparticles for Prostate Cancer Therapy.', 'A comprehensive review of nano-delivery system for tea polyphenols: Construction, applications, and challenges.', 'Nano-Sized Fucoidan Interpolyelectrolyte Complexes: Recent Advances in Design and Prospects for Biomedical Applications.', 'Nano-drug co-delivery system of natural active ingredients and chemotherapy drugs for cancer treatment: a review.']"""

However, most of the current existing studies focus on the prediction of disease-related miRNAs or lncRNAs, and to our knowledge, until now, there are few literature studies reported to pay attention to the study of impact of miRNA-lncRNA pairs on diseases, although more and more studies have shown that both lncRNAs and miRNAs play important roles in cell proliferation and differentiation during the recent years. The identification of disease-related genes provides great insight into the underlying pathogenesis of diseases at a system level. In this study, a novel model called PADLMHOOI was proposed to predict potential associations between diseases and lncRNA-miRNA pairs based on the higher-order orthogonal iteration, and in order to evaluate its prediction performance, the global and local LOOCV were implemented, respectively, and simulation results demonstrated that PADLMHOOI could achieve reliable AUCs of 0.9545 and 0.8874 in global and local LOOCV separately.

Methods:   RT-qPCR was used to detect miR-129-5p expression in tumor tissues and adjacent normal tissues from patients with prostate cancer. The cell proliferation assay and colony forming assay were used to study the role of miR-129-5p in mediating prostate cancer cell growth. Bioinformatic analysis and dual luciferase assay were performed to predict and confirm ETV1 as a target gene of miR-129-5p.  Results:   We found that miR-129-5p levels were decreased significantly in human prostate cancer tissues compared with matched normal tissues from patients with prostate cancer. Overexpression of miR-129-5p suppressed prostate cancer cell growth while antagonist of miR-129-5p promoted cell proliferation in immortal prostate cell line RWPE-1. In addition, elevation of miR-129-5p decreased ETV1 expression in prostate cancer cells while downregulation of miR-129-5p increased ETV1 expression in RWPE-1. Mechanistically, ETV1 is confirmed a direct target of miR-129-5p in prostate cancer cells. Through repression of ETV1 expression, miR-129-5p could inactivate YAP signaling in prostate cancer cells. In addition, overexpression of ETV1 attenuated miR-129-5p induced cell proliferation in prostate cancer cells. Correlation analysis further revealed that there was a negative correlation between miR-129-5p levels and ETV1 mRNA levels in tumor tissues from patients with prostate cancer.

Materials and methods:   Retrospective analysis of patients who underwent radical prostatectomy preceded by staging multiparametric MRI of the prostate was performed. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to choose independent predictors of ECE. Continuous variables were transformed to categorical ones by choosing threshold values using spline knots or testing thresholds used in previously described models. Internal validation of the rule was carried out as well as validation of other algorithms on our group was performed.  Results:   In the analyzed period of time, 88 out of 164 patients who underwent radical prostatectomy met inclusion criteria. ECE was evidenced at radical prostatectomy in 41 patients (46.6%) and in 53 lobes (30.1%). In the multivariate analysis PSA, total percentage of cancerous tissue in cores (%PCa) and maximum tumour diameter (MTD) of Likert 3-5 lesions on MRI were independent predictors of ECE. The following rule for predicting side-specific ECE was proposed: %PCa ≥ 15% OR MTD ≥ 15 mm OR PSA ≥ 20 ng/mL. Internal validation of the algorithm revealed safe lower confidence limits for sensitivity and NPV, proving that model offers accurate risk grouping that can be safely used in decision-making.

Methods:   In the outpatient setting of a single tertiary-care institution, prophylactic antibiotic use and rate of infectious complications were compared before and after implementation by nursing of a standardized algorithm to select antibiotic prophylaxis (derived from the recommendations of the AUA white paper). The 584 patients in cohort A (January 2011-January 2012) received antimicrobial prophylaxis at the discretion of the treating physician; 654 patients in cohort B (January 2014-January 2015) received standardized risk-adapted antibiotic prophylaxis. Data on antibiotics administered and infectious complications were analyzed.  Results:   Fluoroquinolone was the most common prophylactic regimen in both cohorts. In cohort A, 73% of men received a single-drug regimen, although 19 different regimens were utilized with duration of 72 h. In cohort B, 97% received 1 of 4 standardized single-drug antibiotic regimens for duration of 24 h. Infectious complications occurred in 19 men (3.3%) in cohort A, and in 18 men (2.8%) in cohort B (difference - 0.5%; one-sided 95% CI 1.1%).

Twenty consecutive, newly- diagnosed prostate cancer patients were prospectively enrolled and underwent 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT, anatomical MRI or contrast-enhanced CT, and DW-MRI prior to laparoscopic, template-based, extended lymph node dissection. Histopathological findings served as the reference test.  Results:   Histopathology showed LNM in 13 of 20 patients (19 high-risk, 1 intermediate risk). Five patients had metastasis-suspected lymph nodes on 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT. Patient-based analysis showed that the sensitivity and specificity for detecting LNM were 39% and 100% with 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT, 8% and 100% with MRI/CT, and 36% and 83% with DW-MRI, respectively. The positive and negative predictive values were 100% and 49% with 68Ga-PSMA PET/C, 100% and 37% with MRI/CT, and 80% and 42% with DW-MRI. Of 573 dissected lymph nodes, 33 were LNM from 26 regions. True-positive LNM on 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT was 9-11 mm in diameter, whereas false-negative LNM had a median diameter of 4 mm, with only 3 of 30 lymph nodes being larger than 10 mm. LNM were positive for PSMA by immunostaining.  Conclusions:   The sensitivity of 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT was notably better than that of MRI/CT and comparable to that of DW-MRI.

Using HEK-blue cells transfected with the innate immunity receptor complex, we show that both ECRG437-63 and ECRG4133-148 enter cells by interaction with the TLR4 immune complex but neither stimulate NFkB.

MYB-NFIB gene rearrangement occurs in 30-86% of salivary gland adenoid cystic carcinomas. We sought to further characterize MYB gene rearrangement in prostatic basal cell carcinoma and correlate MYB-NFIB fusion status with other clinicopathologic characteristics. To this end, FISH analysis for MYB-NFIB gene fusion using fusion probes was performed on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue sections from prostatic basal cell carcinoma (n = 30), florid basal cell hyperplasia (n = 18), and basal cell adenoma (n = 4). Fourteen of 30 (47%) cases of basal cell carcinoma were positive for MYB-NFIB gene fusion FISH, and no cases of benign basal cell proliferations were positive (p < 0.05). FISH-positive patients (mean age = 63 years, range: 35-81) tended to be younger than FISH-negative patients (mean age = 70 years, range: 55-93). Most FISH-positive cases demonstrated adenoid cystic carcinoma-like morphology (57%), and most FISH-negative cases demonstrated nonadenoid cystic carcinoma-like morphology (93%); one case (FISH-positive) demonstrated areas with both adenoid cystic carcinoma-like and nonadenoid cystic carcinoma-like morphology. FISH-positive cases more frequently demonstrated perineural invasion (50% vs. 14%, p < 0.05) compared to FISH-negative cases. Conversely, tall basal cells (i.e., neoplastic cells at least two times taller than wide) were more frequent in FISH-negative cases than FISH-positive cases (93% vs. 36%, p < 0.05). Approximately, 50% of prostatic basal cell carcinoma harbor MYB-NFIB gene fusion.

Mechanism dissection revealed that Enz could promote the lncRNA-p21 transcription via altering the androgen receptor (AR) binding to different androgen-response-elements, which switch the EZH2 function from histone-methyltransferase to non-histone methyltransferase, consequently methylating the STAT3 to promote the NED. Preclinical studies using the PDX mouse model proved that EZH2 inhibitor could block the Enz-induced NED.

Potency and urinary continence are improved when the neurovascular bundles (NVBs) are spared during a nerve spare (NS) RALP. There is reluctance, however, to perform NS RALP when there are concerns that the cancer extends beyond the capsule of the prostate into the NVB, as NS RALP in this instance increases the risk of a positive surgical margin (PSM). The NeuroSAFE technique involves intraoperative fresh-frozen section analysis of the posterolateral aspect of the prostate margin to assess whether cancer extends beyond the capsule. There is evidence from large observational studies that functional outcomes can be improved and PSM rates reduced when the NeuroSAFE technique is used during RALP. To date, however, there has been no randomised controlled trial (RCT) to substantiate this finding. The NeuroSAFE PROOF feasibility study is designed to assess whether it is feasible to randomise men to NeuroSAFE RALP versus a control arm of 'standard of practice' RALP.  Methods:   NeuroSAFE PROOF feasibility study will be a multicentre, single-blinded RCT with patients randomised 1:1 to either NeuroSAFE RALP (intervention) or standard RALP (control). Treatment allocation will occur after trial entry and consent. The primary outcome will be assessed as the successful accrual of 50 men at three sites over 15 months. Secondary outcomes will be used to aid subsequent power calculations for the definitive full-scale RCT and will include rates of NS; PSM; biochemical recurrence; adjuvant treatments; and patient-reported functional outcomes on potency, continence and quality of life.  Ethics and dissemination:   NeuroSAFE PROOF has ethical approval (Regional Ethics Committee reference 17/LO/1978).

Since the transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) and Wnt signals induce EMT in various epithelial cell types, we examined whether and how the CD82/KAI1 metastasis suppressor affects the TGF-β and Wnt signal-dependent EMT in human prostate cancer cells.  Methods:   The invasiveness of cancer cells was evaluated by examining their ability to pass through the basement membrane matrigel. The subcellular localizations of Smad4 and β-catenin proteins were respectively examined by confocal microscopy following immunofluorescence antibody staining and immunoblotting analysis following subcellular fractionation. The transcriptional activities of the TGF-β1 -responsive TRE and Wnt-responsive Tcf/Lef promoters were determined by a luciferase reporter assay following transfection of the recombinant reporter vector into the cell.  Results:   TGF-β1 and Wnt3a treatments of human prostate cancer cells without CD82 expression resulted in not only increased invasiveness but also EMT involving the development of motile structures, downregulation of E-cadherin, and upregulation of the mesenchymal proteins. However, in the cells with high levels of CD82, the TGF-β1 and Wnt3a stimulations neither elevated invasiveness nor induced EMT. Furthermore, the TGF-β1 signaling events occurring in the CD82-deficient cells, such as phosphorylation of Smad2, nuclear translocation of Smad4, and transactivation of the TRE promoter, did not take place in the high CD82-expressing cells. Further, high CD82 expression interfered with the Wnt signal-dependent alterations in the phosphorylation pattern of glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK-3β) in prostate cancer cells, which allowed GSK-3β to continue phosphorylating β-catenin, thereby attenuating the Wnt signaling effects on the nuclear translocation of β-catenin and subsequent transactivation of the Tcf/Lef promoter.  Conclusions:   The results of the present study suggest that CD82/KAI1 functions in suppressing TGF-β1 - and Wnt-induced EMT in prostate cancer cells by inhibiting the TGF-β1 /Smad and Wnt/β-catenin pathways. Therefore, loss or decrease of CD82 expression is likely to render prostate cancer cells prone to respond to the TGF-β1 and Wnt signals with EMT, resulting in the development of a motile and invasive mesenchymal phenotype related to the initiation of the metastatic cascade.""","""['Moon-Sung Lee', 'Jaeseob Lee', 'Young-Myeong Kim', 'Hansoo Lee']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['The metastasis suppressor CD82/KAI1 inhibits fibronectin adhesion-induced epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in prostate cancer cells by repressing the associated integrin signaling.', 'Synergistic effects of CD44 and TGF-β1 through AKT/GSK-3β/β-catenin signaling during epithelial-mesenchymal transition in liver cancer cells.', 'Resveratrol suppresses epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in colorectal cancer through TGF-β1/Smads signaling pathway mediated Snail/E-cadherin expression.', 'Aberrant Activation Mechanism of TGF-β Signaling in Epithelial-mesenchymal Transition.', 'KAI1/CD82, a tumor metastasis suppressor.', 'Recombinant human KAI1/CD82 attenuates M1 macrophage polarization on LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 cells via blocking TLR4/JNK/NF-κB signal pathway.', 'CD82 attenuates TGF-β1-mediated epithelial-mesenchymal transition by blocking smad-dependent signaling in ARPE-19 cells.', 'Tspan9 Induces EMT and Promotes Osteosarcoma Metastasis via Activating FAK-Ras-ERK1/2 Pathway.', 'Infection by High-Risk Human Papillomaviruses, Epithelial-to-Mesenchymal Transition and Squamous Pre-Malignant or Malignant Lesions of the Uterine Cervix: A Series of Chained Events?', 'Role of Tetraspanins in Hepatocellular Carcinoma.']"""

Triptonide has been reported to have a strong inhibition activity in cancers through screening of Chinese herbal medicine. This study aims to investigate the effects of triptonide on anti-PCa activity and its mechanisms.  Methods:   Three human advanced PCa cell lines PC3, DU145, and LNCap, and a human normal prostate epithelial cell line RWPE were treated with a range (0, 1.25, 2.5, 5, 10, 20, 40, 80, 160, and 320 nM) of triptonide concentrations for 72 hours respectively. Then, cell viability was assessed by cell counting kit-8. PCa cells were treated with different doses (0-20 nM) of triptonide for 72 hours. Cell cycle and apoptosis were assessed by flow cytometry assays. Nude mice bearing human PCa xenografts were intraperitoneally injected daily with either triptonide (10 mg/kg/d) or phosphate-buffered saline as a control for 35 days. RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) was performed by an Illumina Hiseq Sequencing platform and confirmed by a real-time polymerase chain reaction. Gene Ontology, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analysis, and ingenuity pathway analysis were used to analyze RNA-seq results.  Results:   Triptonide effectively inhibits the proliferation of human PCa cells PC3, DU145, and LNCap in vitro with their IC50 values as 11.961, 10.259, and 12.012 nM, respectively. Triptonide (10 mg/kg) potently inhibits the growth of PCa cell xenografts in vivo at an inhibition rate of over 97.95%. Treatment with triptonide (5 nM) significantly promotes cell apoptosis and retaining cell-cycle arrest in the G2/M phase.

Our laboratory has previously shown that SULT2B1b inhibition modulates androgen receptor signaling and induces apoptosis in prostate cancer cells. However, the functions of SULT2B1b in the prostate remain poorly understood.  Methods:   We characterized the expression pattern of SULT2B1b in human benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH) as well as prostate cancer to determine the relationship between SULT2B1b and prostate diseases, using immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence staining, immunoblot, and real-time polymerase chain reaction.  Results:   SULT2B1b was strongly detected in the prostate epithelium but was absent in the stroma. Significantly lower SULT2B1b was found in primary cancer cells compared with adjacent normal epithelial cells. SULT2B1b further decreased in metastatic cancer cells. Most interestingly, we found, for the first time, that SULT2B1b was much more concentrated in the luminal layer than in the basal layer in both normal prostate and BPH samples. The stronger presence of SULT2B1b in luminal epithelial cells was confirmed by costaining with luminal and basal markers and in sorted paired luminal and basal cells. SULT2B1b expression was induced with prostate organoid differentiation.  Conclusions:   SULT2B1b inversely correlates with prostate cancer status, with the highest level in the normal epithelium and lowest in the advanced metastatic prostate cancer. Furthermore, SULT2B1b is mostly located within the luminal layer of the prostate epithelium, suggesting that it may be implicated in luminal differentiation.""","""['Jiang Yang', 'Meaghan M Broman', 'Paula O Cooper', 'Nadia A Lanman', 'Douglas W Strand', 'Colm Morrissey', 'Timothy L Ratliff']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Cholesterol Sulfonation Enzyme, SULT2B1b, Modulates AR and Cell Growth Properties in Prostate Cancer.', 'Expression of c-kit and kit-ligand in benign and malignant prostatic tissues.', 'Inhibition of SULT2B1b expression alters effects of 3beta-hydroxysteroids on cell proliferation and steroid hormone receptor expression in human LNCaP prostate cancer cells.', 'Differentiation pathways and histogenetic aspects of normal and abnormal prostatic growth: a stem cell model.', 'The role of the androgen receptor in the development of prostatic hyperplasia and prostate cancer.', 'The utility of 3D models to study cholesterol in cancer: Insights and future perspectives.', '27-Hydroxycholesterol promotes metastasis by SULT2A1-dependent alteration in hepatocellular carcinoma.']"""

As these models are challenging to establish from prostate cancer specimens, the ability to preserve them through cryopreservation has several advantages for ongoing research. Despite this, there is still uncertainty about the ability to cryopreserve PDXs of prostate cancer. This study compared three different cryopreservation protocols to identify a method that can be used to reproducibly cryopreserve a diverse cohort of prostate cancer PDX models.  Methods:   One serially transplantable prostate cancer PDX from the Melbourne Urological Research Alliance cohort was used to compare three cryopreservation protocols: slow freezing in fetal calf serum (FCS) with 10% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), FCS with 10% DMSO supplemented with the Rho-associated kinase (ROCK) inhibitor Y-27632 and vitrification. The efficiency of the slow freezing protocols was then assessed in 17 additional prostate cancer PDXs. Following cryopreservation, PDXs were re-established in host mice that were either intact and supplemented with testosterone or castrated. Graft take rate, tumor growth, histological features, and transcriptome profiles before and after cryopreservation were compared.  Results:   Slow freezing maintained the viability and histological features of prostate cancer PDXs, and the addition of a ROCK inhibitor increased their growth following cryopreservation. Using the slow freezing method, we re-established 100% of PDXs grown in either testosterone-supplemented or castrated host mice. Importantly, the long-term tumor growth rate and transcriptome profile were maintained following cryopreservation.  Conclusion:   This study has identified a protocol to reliably cryopreserve and re-establish a diverse cohort of serially transplantable PDXs of prostate cancer. This study has the potential to significantly improve the practicality of maintaining PDX models. Cryopreservation may also increase the accessibility of these important resources and provide new opportunities for preclinical studies on a broader spectrum of prostate tumors.""","""['Laura H Porter', 'Mitchell G Lawrence', 'Hong Wang', 'Ashlee K Clark', 'Andrew Bakshi', 'Daisuke Obinata', 'David Goode', 'Melissa Papargiris', 'Mural', 'David Clouston', 'Andrew Ryan', 'Sam Norden', 'Eva Corey', 'Peter S Nelson', 'John T Isaacs', 'Jeremy Grummet', 'John Kourambas', 'Shahneen Sandhu', 'Declan G Murphy', 'David Pook', 'Mark Frydenberg', 'Renea A Taylor', 'Gail P Risbridger']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['The future of patient-derived xenografts in prostate cancer research.', 'Movember GAP1 PDX project: An international collection of serially transplantable prostate cancer patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models.', 'Establishment of primary patient-derived xenografts of palliative TURP specimens to study castrate-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Biobanking of patient and patient-derived xenograft ovarian tumour tissue: efficient preservation with low and high fetal calf serum based methods.', 'Prostate cancer xenografts and hormone induced prostate carcinogenesis.', 'The future of patient-derived xenografts in prostate cancer research.', 'Breaking down walls in prostate cancer with the MURAL collection of patient-derived xenografts.', 'The MURAL collection of prostate cancer patient-derived xenografts enables discovery through preclinical models of uro-oncology.', 'High-Throughput Imaging Assay for Drug Screening of 3D Prostate Cancer Organoids.', 'PDX: Moving Beyond Drug Screening to Versatile Models for Research Discovery.']"""

However, the role of POH1 in prostate cancer (PCa) remains unclear.  Methods:   We performed RNA interference against the JAMM members in PC3 cells and analyzed cell proliferation. POH1 knockdown was established to evaluate the effects of POH1 on cell growth in vitro and in vivo. RNA-sequencing was utilized to explore the molecular details underlying the biological function of POH1 in PCa. The expression of POH1 in PCa tissues was detected by immunohistochemistry. The POH1 inhibitor capzimin was evaluated to explore whether pharmacologically inhibiting POH1 significantly affected PCa cell proliferation alone or enhanced the inhibitory efficacy of docetaxel and androgen deprivation.  Results:   Functional analyses identified POH1 as a JAMM deubiquitinase that is required for PCa proliferation. Importantly, expression of POH1 was higher in human PCa tissues (PCas) than that in normal prostate tissues, and a positive correlation was detected between elevated POH1 expression and higher pathological grades in PCas. In vivo experiments further demonstrated that depleting POH1 significantly suppressed the growth of PCa cell xenografts. POH1 deficiency profoundly inhibited the expression of a set of genes involving the cell cycle and caused G0/G1 phase arrest. Furthermore, the POH1 inhibitor capzimin phenotypically recapitulated the effects of POH1 knockdown and improved the efficacy of docetaxel and androgen deprivation in PCa cells.  Conclusions:   POH1 was overexpressed in PCas and was correlated with pathological grades in human PCas. Inhibiting POH1 by gene silencing or pharmacological inhibition with capzimin suppressed PCa cell growth. Exploring the inhibition of POH1 in combination with other drugs may provide a strategy to benefit patients with PCa.""","""['Wandong Yu', 'Junhong Li', 'Qiang Wang', 'Boshi Wang', 'Li Zhang', 'Yun Liu', 'Ming Tang', 'Guiqing Xu', 'Zhaojuan Yang', 'Xilong Wang', 'Jun Zhang', 'Yongzhong Liu', 'Guowei Shi']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['POH1/Rpn11/PSMD14: a journey from basic research in fission yeast to a prognostic marker and a druggable target in cancer cells.', 'Combination treatment of docetaxel with caffeic acid phenethyl ester suppresses the survival and the proliferation of docetaxel-resistant prostate cancer cells via induction of apoptosis and metabolism interference.', 'Anti-cancer efficacy of SREBP inhibitor, alone or in combination with docetaxel, in prostate cancer harboring p53 mutations.', 'POH1 Knockdown Induces Cancer Cell Apoptosis via p53 and Bim.', 'Oxidative stress and androgen receptor signaling in the development and progression of castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'PSMD8 can serve as potential biomarker and therapeutic target of the PSMD family in ovarian cancer: based on bioinformatics analysis and in vitro validation.', 'Deubiquitinases in Cancers: Aspects of Proliferation, Metastasis, and Apoptosis.', 'The prognostic role of PSMD14 in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.', 'POH1/Rpn11/PSMD14: a journey from basic research in fission yeast to a prognostic marker and a druggable target in cancer cells.', 'Identification of PSMD14 as a potential novel prognosis biomarker and therapeutic target for osteosarcoma.']"""

Since PSA is expressed exclusively by prostatic luminal epithelial cells, PSA in the BPH stroma suggests increased tissue permeability and the compromise of epithelial barrier integrity. E-cadherin, an important adherens junction component and tight junction regulator, is known to exhibit downregulation in BPH. These observations suggest that the prostate epithelial barrier is disrupted in BPH and E-cadherin downregulation may increase epithelial barrier permeability.  Methods:   The ultra-structure of cellular junctions in BPH specimens was observed using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and E-cadherin immunostaining analysis was performed on BPH and normal adjacent specimens from BPH patients. In vitro cell line studies using benign prostatic epithelial cell lines were performed to determine the impact of small interfering RNA knockdown of E-cadherin on transepithelial electrical resistance and diffusion of fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-dextran in transwell assays.  Results:   The number of kiss points in tight junctions was reduced in BPH epithelial cells as compared with the normal adjacent prostate. Immunostaining confirmed E-cadherin downregulation and revealed a discontinuous E-cadherin staining pattern in BPH specimens. E-cadherin knockdown increased monolayer permeability and disrupted tight junction formation without affecting cell density.  Conclusions:   Our results indicate that tight junctions are compromised in BPH and loss of E-cadherin is potentially an important underlying mechanism, suggesting targeting E-cadherin loss could be a potential approach to prevent or treat BPH.""","""['Feng Li', 'Laura E Pascal', 'Donna B Stolz', 'Ke Wang', 'Yibin Zhou', 'Wei Chen', 'Yadong Xu', 'Yule Chen', 'Rajiv Dhir', 'Anil V Parwani', 'Joel B Nelson', 'Donald B DeFranco', 'Naoki Yoshimura', 'Goundappa K Balasubramani', 'Jeffrey R Gingrich', 'Jodi K Maranchie', 'Bruce L Jacobs', 'Benjamin J Davies', 'Ronald L Hrebinko', 'Joel D Bigley', 'Dawn McBride', 'Peng Guo', 'Dalin He', 'Zhou Wang']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Transforming growth factor beta 1 impairs benign prostatic luminal epithelial cell monolayer barrier function.', 'Tight junction protein claudin-1 is downregulated by TGF-β1 via MEK signaling in benign prostatic epithelial cells.', 'Proteomic analysis of patient tissue reveals PSA protein in the stroma of benign prostatic hyperplasia.', 'Transcriptional mechanisms coordinating tight junction assembly during epithelial differentiation.', 'The tight junction and the epithelial barrier in coeliac disease.', 'Simvastatin Improves Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia: Role of Peroxisome-Proliferator-Activated Receptor-γ and Classic WNT/β-Catenin Pathway.', 'The Emerging Role of Cell Adhesion Molecules on Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia.', 'Changes in the Expression and Functional Activities of C-X-C Motif Chemokine Ligand 13 (CXCL13) in Hyperplastic Prostate.', 'Applications of Vertebrate Models in Studying Prostatitis and Inflammation-Associated Prostatic Diseases.', 'Application of Proteogenomics to Urine Analysis towards the Identification of Novel Biomarkers of Prostate Cancer: An Exploratory Study.']"""

Human immune system-engrafted models are used in immuno-oncology (IO) studies for subcutaneous cancer cell or patient-derived xenograft implantations that mimic primary tumor growth. Novel efficacy models for IO compounds on bone metastases need to be established. The study was performed using CIEA NOG (NOG) mice engrafted with human CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells (huNOG) and age-matched immunodeficient NOG mice. Bone phenotyping was performed to evaluate baseline differences. BT-474 human breast cancer cells were inoculated into the tibia bone marrow, and cancer-induced bone changes were monitored by X-ray imaging. Bone content and volume were analyzed by dual X-ray absorptiometry and microcomputed tomography. Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and the expression of immune checkpoint markers were analyzed by immunohistochemistry. Bone phenotyping showed no differences in bone architecture or volume of the healthy bones in huNOG and NOG mice, but the bone marrow fat was absent in huNOG mice. Fibrotic areas were observed in the bone marrow of some huNOG mice. BT-474 tumors induced osteoblastic bone growth. Bone lesions appeared earlier and were larger, and bone mineral density was higher in huNOG mice. huNOG mice had a high number of human CD3-, CD4-, and CD8-positive T cells and CD20-positive B cells in immune-related organs. A low number of TILs and PD-1-positive cells and low PD-L1 expression were observed in the BT-474 tumors at the endpoint. This study reports characterization of the first breast cancer bone growth model in huNOG mice. BT-474 tumors represent a ""cold"" tumor with a low number of TILs.

In order to design new therapeutic interventions for PC, an understanding of the molecular events underlying PC tumorigenesis is required. Bloom syndrome protein (BLM) is a RecQ-like helicase, which helps maintain genetic stability. BLM dysfunction has been implicated in tumor development, most recently during PC tumorigenesis. However, the molecular basis for BLM-induced PC progression remains poorly characterized. In this study, we investigated whether BLM modulates the phosphorylation of an array of prooncogenic signaling pathways to promote PC progression.  Methods:   We analyzed differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) using iTRAQ technology. Site-directed knockout of BLM in PC-3 prostate cancer cells was performed using CRISPR/Cas9-mediated homologous recombination gene editing to confirm the effects of BLM on DEPs. PathScan® Antibody Array Kits were used to analyze the phosphorylation of nodal proteins in PC tissue. Immunohistochemistry and automated western blot (WES) analyses were used to validate these findings.  Results:   We found that silencing BLM in PC-3 cells significantly reduced their proliferative capacity. In addition, BLM downregulation significantly reduced levels of phosphorylated protein kinase B (AKT (Ser473)) and proline-rich AKT substrate of 40 kDa (PRAS40 (Thr246)), and this was accompanied by enhanced ROS (reactive oxygen species) levels. In addition, we found that AKT and PRAS40 inhibition reduced BLM, increased ROS levels, and induced PC cell apoptosis.  Conclusions:   We demonstrated that BLM activates AKT and PRAS40 to promote PC cell proliferation and survival. We further propose that ROS act in concert with BLM to facilitate PC oncogenesis, potentially via further enhancing AKT signaling and downregulating PTEN expression. Importantly, inhibiting the BLM-AKT-PRAS40 axis induced PC cell apoptosis. Thus, we highlight new avenues for novel anti-PC treatments.""","""['Kun Chen', 'Houqiang Xu', 'Jiafu Zhao']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Oxid Med Cell Longev""","""[""Bloom helicase explicitly unwinds 3'-tailed G4DNA structure in prostate cancer cells."", 'Sin1 promotes proliferation and invasion of prostate cancer cells by modulating mTORC2-AKT and AR signaling cascades.', 'Functional Role of mTORC2 versus Integrin-Linked Kinase in Mediating Ser473-Akt Phosphorylation in PTEN-Negative Prostate and Breast Cancer Cell Lines.', 'Proline-rich AKT substrate of 40-kDa (PRAS40) in the pathophysiology of cancer.', 'Proline-rich Akt substrate of 40kDa (PRAS40): a novel downstream target of PI3k/Akt signaling pathway.', 'Identification of key enzalutamide-resistance-related genes in castration-resistant prostate cancer and verification of RAD51 functions.', 'BLM promotes malignancy in PCa by inducing KRAS expression and RhoA suppression via its interaction with HDGF and activation of MAPK/ERK pathway.', ""Discovery of a Novel Bloom's Syndrome Protein (BLM) Inhibitor Suppressing Growth and Metastasis of Prostate Cancer."", 'Downregulation of BLM RecQ helicase inhibits proliferation, promotes the apoptosis and enhances the sensitivity of bladder cancer cells to cisplatin.', 'RecQ Helicase Somatic Alterations in Cancer.']"""

This study aims to evaluate the potential diagnostic and prognostic values of TUG1 in PCa.  Patients and methods:   Plasma level of TUG1 in 70 PCa patients and 70 healthy controls was determined using the quantitative Real Time-Polymerase Chain Reaction (qRT-PCR). Correlation between plasma level of TUG1 with PSA level, Gleason grading and TNM stage of PCa patients was analyzed. The potential diagnostic value of TUG1 in PCa was explored by introducing the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. The survival analysis of PCa patients undergoing radical prostatectomy was conducted using the Kaplan-Meier method and the log-rank test. Finally, the regulatory effects of TUG1 on in vitro proliferative and migratory abilities of PCa cells were examined by the cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) and the transwell assay, respectively.  Results:   QRT-PCR data revealed a higher plasma level of TUG1 in PCa patients than in those of healthy controls. In particular, PCa patients with stage III+IV had a higher level of TUG1 relative to those with stage I+II. Moreover, the TUG1 level was higher in PCa patients with a higher PSA level (≥ 10 ng/mL), Gleason grading (≥ 7) or TNM stage (N1, M1). There was no significant correlation between the plasma level of TUG1 and the age of PCa patients. The ROC and Kaplan-Meier curves indicated the diagnostic and prognostic values of TUG1 in PCa.

Whether transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) has negative postoperative effects on oncological outcomes remains controversial. The primary aim of our retrospective study was to determine whether a history of TURP could affect the postoperative BCR rate. We retrospectively reviewed patients with prostate cancer (PCa) who had undergone RP between January 2009 and October 2017. Clinical data on age, prostate volume, serum prostate-specific antigen levels (PSA), biopsy Gleason score (GS), metastasis stage (TNM), D'Amico classification, and American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) classification were collected. Statistical analyses including Cox proportional hazard models and sensitivity analyses which included propensity score matching, were performed, and the inverse-probability-of-treatment-weighted estimator and standardized mortality ratio-weighted estimator were determined. We included 1083 patients, of which 118 had a history of TURP. Before matching, the non-TURP group differed from the TURP group with respect to GS (P= 0.047), prostate volume (mean: 45.19 vs 36.00 ml, P < 0.001), and PSA level (mean: 29.41 vs 15.11 ng ml-1, P= 0.001).

Antibody-based positron emission tomography (immuno-PET) as a cancer-specific imaging modality could improve diagnosis of primary disease, aid the detection of metastases to regional lymph nodes as well as to distant sites (e.g., bone), and monitor response to therapy.  Procedure:   In search for a more physiologically relevant disease model, a human prostate stem cell antigen knock-in (hPSCA KI) mouse model was generated. The use of a syngeneic prostate cancer cell line transduced to express human PSCA (RM-9-hPSCA) enabled the evaluation of anti-PSCA immuno-PET in immunocompetent mice and in the context of normal tissue expression of PSCA. Two PSCA-specific humanized antibody fragments, A11 minibody and A2 cys-diabody, were radiolabeled with positron emitters iodine-124 and zirconium-89, respectively ([124I]A11 Mb and [89Zr]A2cDb), and used for immuno-PET in wild-type, hPSCA KI and tumor-bearing mice.  Results:   The hPSCA KI mice express PSCA at low levels in the normal prostate, bladder and stomach, reproducing the expression pattern seen in humans. [124I]A11 Mb immuno-PET detected increased levels of PSCA expression in the stomach, and because I-124 is non-residualizing, very little activity was seen in organs of clearance (liver, kidney, spleen). However, due to the longer half-life of the 80 kDa protein, blood activity (and thus urine activity) at 20 h postinjection remains high. The smaller 50 kDa [89Zr]A2cDb cleared faster, resulting in lower blood and background activity, despite the use of a residualizing radiometal. Importantly, [89Zr]A2cDb immuno-PET showed antigen-specific targeting of PSCA-expressing tumors and minimal nonspecific uptake in PSCA-negative controls.  Conclusion:   Tracer biodistribution was not significantly impacted by normal tissue expression of PSCA. [89Zr]A2cDb immuno-PET yielded high tumor-to-blood ratio at early time points. Rapid renal clearance of the 50 kDa tracer resulted in an unobstructed view of the pelvic region at 20 h postinjection that would allow the detection of cancer in the prostate.""","""['Kirstin A Zettlitz', 'Wen-Ting K Tsai', 'Scott M Knowles', 'Felix B Salazar', 'Naoko Kobayashi', 'Robert E Reiter', 'Anna M Wu']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Mol Imaging Biol""","""['Dual-Modality Immuno-PET and Near-Infrared Fluorescence Imaging of Pancreatic Cancer Using an Anti-Prostate Stem Cell Antigen Cys-Diabody.', 'Evaluation of 131II- and 177LuLu-DTPA-A11 Minibody for Radioimmunotherapy in a Preclinical Model of PSCA-Expressing Prostate Cancer.', 'Quantitative immunoPET of prostate cancer xenografts with 89Zr- and 124I-labeled anti-PSCA A11 minibody.', 'Prostate stem cell antigen: a Jekyll and Hyde molecule?', '124I-Labeled anti-prostate stem cell antigen affinity-matured A11 minibody.', 'ImmunoPET: Antibody-Based PET Imaging in Solid Tumors.', 'Radiochemical Approaches to Imaging Bacterial Infections: Intracellular versus Extracellular Targets.']"""

ERG rearrangements and PTEN loss are concomitant events in PrCa. The aim of this study has been to analyze the immunohistochemical (IHC) expression of MSH2, MSH6, MLH1, PMS2, ERG, and PTEN and their potential association with the grade group (GG) grading system (WHO 2016) and PSA recurrence in a series of 200 PrCa (PSMAR-Biobank, Barcelona, Spain). MSH2, MLH1, PMS2, and PTEN losses were documented in 8%, 5%, 2%, and 36.5%, respectively. ERG expression was found in 48%. MSH6 showed an increase of expression with respect to basal levels in 42.1% of the cases. A statistical association between MSH6 overexpression and GG5 was found (p = 0.0281). ERG-wild-type cases were associated with single MSH2 loss (p = 0.024), and MSH2 and/or MLH1 loss (p = 0.019). The percentage of cases with PTEN loss was 20.5% (8/39) in GG1, 37.6% (53/141) of clustered GG2 to 4, and 60% (12/20) of GG5 (chi-square test, p = 0.01). Thus, PTEN expression loss was statistically more frequent in the upper-grade tumors. PMS2 loss was an infrequent event, but it was statistically associated with shorter time to PSA recurrence (p = 0.011). These results suggest the existence of an alternative non-ERG pathway associated with MSH2 or MLH1 expression loss. MSH6 overexpression could be a marker of aggressiveness in PrCa. The IHC assessment of DNA MMR proteins, ERG and PTEN, could identify different altered PrCa pathways, which could aid patient stratification.""","""['Raquel Albero-González', 'Silvia Hernández-Llodrà', 'Nuria Juanpere', 'Marta Lorenzo', 'Adrià Lloret', 'Laura Segalés', 'Xavier Duran', 'Lluís Fumadó', 'Lluís Cecchini', 'Josep Lloreta-Trull']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Virchows Arch""","""['Up-regulation of mismatch repair genes MSH6, PMS2 and MLH1 parallels development of genetic instability and is linked to tumor aggressiveness and early PSA recurrence in prostate cancer.', 'Loss of DNA mismatch repair proteins in prostate cancer.', 'Concurrent TMPRSS2-ERG and SLC45A3-ERG rearrangements plus PTEN loss are not found in low grade prostate cancer and define an aggressive tumor subset.', 'Hereditary Predisposition to Prostate Cancer: From Genetics to Clinical Implications.', 'Pathology-based Biomarkers Useful for Clinical Decisions in Melanoma.', 'Recent Research Advances in Double-Strand Break and Mismatch Repair Defects in Prostate Cancer and Potential Clinical Applications.', 'Correlations of PTEN and ERG Immunoexpression in Prostate Carcinoma and Lesions Related to Its Natural History: Clinical Perspectives.', 'An Evaluation of the Immunohistochemical Expression of Mismatch Repair Proteins (MSH2, MSH6, MLH1, and PMS2) in Prostate Adenocarcinoma.', 'Clinicopathological Significance of Exosomal Proteins CD9 and CD63 and DNA Mismatch Repair Proteins in Prostate Adenocarcinoma and Benign Hyperplasia.', 'Genetic Analysis Reveals the Prognostic Significance of the DNA Mismatch Repair Gene MSH2 in Advanced Prostate Cancer.']"""

Methods:   All anticoagulant use during 1995-2015 was analyzed among 75,336 men in the Finnish Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer. Men with prevalent cancer were excluded. Multivariable Cox regression was performed to compare risk of death from any cancer and disease-specific death from 9 specific cancer types between (1) anticoagulant users overall and (2) warfarin users compared to anticoagulant non-users and (3) warfarin or (4) low-molecular-weight heparins (LMWH) compared to users of other anticoagulants. Medication use was analyzed as time-dependent variable to minimize immortal time bias. 1-, 2- and 3-year lag-time analyses were performed.  Results:   During a median follow-up of 17.2 years, a total of 27,233 men died of whom 8033 with cancer as the primary cause of death. In total, 32,628 men (43%) used anticoagulants.

So the PSA screening test is very important due to the high occurrence of prostate cancer in men. In this work, a label-free fluorescent method was developed based on terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) and G-quadruplex-thioflavin T complex for detecting PSA. In the absence of PSA, the PSA aptamer can be used as the primer for TdT extension reactions, resulting in the formation of G-quadruplexes and generation of strong fluorescent signals. After the addition of PSA, the PSA-aptamer complex prevented the TdT extension reaction due to steric hindrance, thus resulting in a poor fluorescent signal. The assay showed a wide linear range (0.1 to 80 pg/mL) and a detection limit of 0.086 pg/mL (S/N = 3). It also has good specificity for PSA determination and gives satisfactory results when applied to biological samples. Conceivably, its merits such as good selectivity and high sensitivity indicate that the proposed method has a promising application potential in the clinical diagnosis and treatment of prostate cancer.

The modeling data were output as STL format, and the prostate models were simultaneously displayed on an android tablet during the operation to help achieving cognitive navigation.  Results:   Based on original U-net architecture, we established a modified U-net from a 201-case MR imaging training set. The network performance was tested and compared with human segmentations and other segmentation networks by using one certain testing data set. Auto segmentation of multi-structures (such as prostate, prostate tumors, seminal vesicles, rectus, neurovascular bundles and dorsal venous complex) were successfully achieved.

Hence, we investigated mechanisms of lapatinib resistance to determine whether alternate ErbB inhibitors can succeed.  Methods:   The CWR22 human tumour xenograft and its CRPC subline 22Rv1 and sera from lapatinib-treated CRPC patients from a previously reported Phase II trial were used to study lapatinib resistance. Mechanistic studies were conducted in LNCaP, C4-2 and 22Rv1 cell lines.  Results:   Lapatinib increased intratumoral HER2 protein, which encouraged resistance to this treatment in mouse models. Sera from CRPC patients following lapatinib treatment demonstrated increased HER2 levels. Investigation of the mechanism of lapatinib-induced HER2 increase revealed that lapatinib promotes HER2 protein stability, leading to membrane localisation, EGFR/HER2 heterodimerisation and signalling, elevating cell viability. Knockdown of HER2 and ErbB3, but not EGFR, sensitised CRPC cells to lapatinib. At equimolar concentrations, the recently FDA-approved pan-ErbB inhibitor dacomitinib decreased HER2 protein stability, prevented ErbB membrane localisation (despite continued membrane integrity) and EGFR/HER2 heterodimerisation, thereby decreasing downstream signalling and increasing apoptosis.

Upregulation of FOXP4-AS1 was further validated in 64 PCa tissues and predicted poor prognosis in patients with PCa.

Furthermore, FOXP4-AS1 was located in the cytoplasm of PCa cell lines and positively regulated FOXP4. LncRNAs can exert their functions by cooperating with their nearby genes.

While the DNA repair mechanisms responsible for cancer cell survival following DNA damaging treatments are becoming better understood, less is known about the role of the epigenome in this process. Using prostate cancer cell lines with differing sensitivities to radiation treatment, we analysed the DNA methylation profiles prior to and following a single dose of radiotherapy (RT) using the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip platform. DSB formation and repair, in the absence and presence of the DNA hypomethylating agent, 5-azacytidine (5-AzaC), were also investigated using γH2A.X immunofluorescence staining. Here we demonstrate that DNA methylation is generally stable following a single dose of RT; however, a small number of CpG sites are stably altered up to 14 d following exposure. While the radioresistant and radiosensitive cells displayed distinct basal DNA methylation profiles, their susceptibility to DNA damage appeared similar demonstrating that basal DNA methylation has a limited influence on DSB induction at the regions examined. Recovery from DSB induction was also similar between these cells. Treatment with 5-AzaC did not sensitize resistant cells to DNA damage, but rather delayed recruitment of phosphorylated BRCA1 (S1423) and repair of DSBs. These results highlight that stable epigenetic changes are possible following a single dose of RT and may have significant clinical implications for cancer treatment involving recurrent or fractionated dosing regimens.""","""['Laura P Sutton', 'Sarah A Jeffreys', 'Jessica L Phillips', 'Phillippa C Taberlay', 'Adele F Holloway', 'Mark Ambrose', 'Ji-Hoon E Joo', 'Arabella Young', 'Rachael Berry', 'Marketa Skala', 'Kate H Brettingham-Moore']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Epigenetics""","""['Genome-wide DNA methylation modified by soy phytoestrogens: role for epigenetic therapeutics in prostate cancer?', 'TGF-β induces global changes in DNA methylation during the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in ovarian cancer cells.', 'Zerumbone Regulates DNA Repair Responding to Ionizing Radiation and Enhances Radiosensitivity of Human Prostatic Cancer Cells.', 'Epigenetic DNA methylation in radiation biology: on the field or on the sidelines?', 'BRCA1 role in the mitigation of radiotoxicity and chromosomal instability through repair of clustered DNA lesions.', 'Lineage plasticity and treatment resistance in prostate cancer: the intersection of genetics, epigenetics, and evolution.', 'Multiomics analysis of adaptation to repeated DNA damage in prostate cancer cells.', 'Inflammation and DNA damage: cause, effect or both.', 'Integrated Bioinformatic Analysis of DNA Methylation and Immune Infiltration in Endometrial Cancer.', 'From Omics to Multi-Omics Approaches for In-Depth Analysis of the Molecular Mechanisms of Prostate Cancer.']"""

At the 5' end, exons 1 and 2 are spliced alternatively to exon 3, giving different leader/signal sequences. It is shown in this study that in human an additional exon (designated exon 0) is present, upstream of exon 1. This can be spliced directly to exon 3 or, less frequently, into exon 1. Exon 0 is utilized in liver, in about 24% of IGF-I transcripts, to a minor extent in prostate and endometrium (<1% of transcripts), but not in any of 29 other normal human tissues examined. The exon 0 sequence includes an in-frame ATG/AUG, potentially providing a translation start point giving an IGF-I precursor with a very long signal peptide. However, this ATG is very close to the 5' end, and may not be included in all transcripts; an in-frame ATG in exon 3 could provide an alternative start point. Utilization of exon 0 was detected in other apes, and to a small extent in Old World monkeys, but not in New World monkeys, prosimians or various non-primate mammals.

Methods:   Information on more than half a million cancer patients aged 15-74 years collected by population-based Italian cancer registries and mixture cure models were used to estimate the life expectancy of fatal tumors (LEFT), proportions of patients with similar death rates of the general population (cure fraction), and time to reach 5-year conditional relative survival (CRS) >90% or 95% (time to cure).  Results:   Between 1990 and 2000, the median LEFT increased >1 year for breast (from 8.1 to 9.4 years) and prostate cancers (from 5.2 to 7.4 years). Median LEFT in 1990 was >5 years for testicular cancers (5.8) and Hodgkin lymphoma (6.3) below 45 years of age. In both sexes, it was ≤0.5 years for pancreatic cancers and NHL in 1990 and in 2000. The cure fraction showed a 10% increase between 1990 and 2000. It was 95% for thyroid cancer in women, 94% for testis, 75% for prostate, 67% for breast cancers, and <20% for liver, lung, and pancreatic cancers. Time to 5-year CRS >95% was <10 years for testis, thyroid, colon cancers, and melanoma. For breast and prostate cancers, the 5-year CRS >90% was reached in <10 years but a small excess remained for >15 years.

Stroma plays an important role during prostate cancer progression and undergoes histological and transcriptional changes associated with disease. However, identification and validation of stromal markers is limited by a lack of datasets with defined stromal/tumour ratio. We have developed a prostate-selective signature to estimate the stromal content in cancer samples of mixed cellular composition. We identified stromal-specific markers from transcriptomic datasets of developmental prostate mesenchyme and prostate cancer stroma. These were experimentally validated in cell lines, datasets of known stromal content, and by immunohistochemistry in tissue samples to verify stromal-specific expression. Linear models based upon six transcripts were able to infer the stromal content and estimate stromal composition in mixed tissues. The best model had a coefficient of determination R2 of 0.67. Application of our stromal content estimation model in various prostate cancer datasets led to improved performance of stromal predictive signatures for disease progression and metastasis. The stromal content of prostate tumours varies considerably; consequently, deconvolution of stromal proportion may yield better results than tumour cell deconvolution. We suggest that adjusting expression data for cell composition will improve stromal signature performance and lead to better prognosis and stratification of men with prostate cancer. © 2019 The Authors.

Methods:   Thirty patients underwent SBRT treatment to the prostate and PLN from 2014 to 2016. Each patient received either 800cGy × 5 or 500cGy × 5 to the prostate and 500cGy × 5 to the PLN. A 5 mm clinical target volume (CTV)-to-planning target volume (PTV) margin around the PLN was used for planning. Two registrations with planning computed tomography (PCT) for each of the daily cone beam CTs (CBCTs) were performed: a rigid registration to fiducials and to the bony anatomy. The average translational difference between fiducial and bony match as well as percentage of fractions with differences > 5mm were calculated. Changes in bladder and rectal volume as well as center-of-mass (COM) position from simulation parameters, and their correlation with translational difference were also evaluated. The dosimetric impact of the translational differences was calculated by shifting the plan isocenter.  Results:   The average translational difference between fiducial and bony match was 0.06 ± 0.82, 2.1 ± 4.1, -2.8 ± 4.3, and 5.5 ± 4.2 mm for lateral, vertical, longitudinal, and vector directions. The average change in bladder and rectal volume from simulation was -67.2 ± 163.04 cc (-12 ± 52%) and -1.6 ± 18.75 (-2 ± 30%) cc. The average change in COM of bladder from the simulation position was 0.34 ± 2.49, 4.4 ± 8.1, and -3.9 ± 7.5 mm along the LR, AP, and SI directions. The corresponding COM change for the rectum was 0.17 ± 1.9, 1.34 ± 3.5, and -0.6 ± 5.2 mm.  Conclusions:   The 5 mm margin covered ~75% of fractions receiving PLN irradiation with SBRT, daily CBCT and fiducial-guided setup. The dosimetric impact on PLN coverage was significant in 19% of fractions or 25% of patients. A larger translational shift was due to variation in rectal volume and changes in COM position of the bladder and rectum. A consistent bladder positioning and/or rectum filling compared with presimulation volume were essential for adequate coverage of PLN in a hypofractionated treatment regime.""","""['Neelam Tyagi', 'Elizabeth Hipp', 'Michelle Cloutier', 'Tomer Charas', 'Sandra Fontenla', 'James Mechalakos', 'Margie Hunt', 'Michael Zelefsky']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""J Appl Clin Med Phys""","""['Pelvic nodal dosing with registration to the prostate: implications for high-risk prostate cancer patients receiving stereotactic body radiation therapy.', 'Analyses of the factors influencing the accuracy of three-dimensional ultrasound in comparison with cone-beam CT in image-guided radiotherapy for prostate cancer with or without pelvic lymph node irradiation.', 'PTV margin analysis for prostate patients treated with initial pelvic nodal IMRT and prostate proton boost.', 'The influence of the bowel and bladder preparation protocol for radiotherapy of prostate cancer using kilo-voltage cone beam CT: Our experience.', 'Image-Guided Radiotherapy for Pelvic Cancers: A Review of Current Evidence and Clinical Utilisation.', 'Maintaining consistent bladder filling during external beam radiotherapy for prostate cancer.']"""

However, the regulatory mechanism of DACT-2 expression and its biological role in human prostate cancer (PCa) remains elusive. Here, we investigated the expression and an epigenetic change of DACT-2 in prostate cancer, and determined if these findings were correlated with clinicopathologic characteristics of PCa. Methods: The expression profile of DACT-2 of was detected by qRT-PCR, Western blotting, and immunohistochemistry in four prostate cell lines (RWPE-1, LNCaP, PC-3 and DU145), 56 cases of frozen prostate tissues (forty-seven primary prostate carcinomas, nine paired noncancerous and cancerous prostate tissues) and a tissue microarray sets including 100 paraffin-embedded prostate samples (3 normal tissues, 2 cases of adjacent tissues and 95 cases of cancer). Subsequently, the regulatory mechanism of DACT-2 down-regulation was investigated through methylation-specific PCR (MSP) and bisulfite sequencing (BSP). The role of DACT-2 in prostate cancer cell migration and invasion was respectively examined by wound healing and transwell assay. After 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine treatment of prostate cancer cells, qRT-PCR was used to detect whether the expression of DACT-2 gene mRNA in the cells recovered. Results: Immunohistochemical results shown that the DACT-2 protein was strongly (3+) expressed in the cytoplasm of all 5 noncancerous tissues and 12.7% (12/95) prostate cancer (PCa) tissues. Whereas 68.4% (65/95) PCa samples and 18.9% (18/95) PCa tissues respectively displayed weakly (1+) expressed and moderately (2+) expressed. In addition, DACT-2 expression was negatively associated with Gleason score in tumor specimens (p=0.029). What's more, down-regulation and promoter methylation of DACT-2 were observed in 68.1% (32/47) frozen PCa tissues and all three prostate cancer cell lines. And, the expression of DACT-2 mRNA was restored by the treatment of demethylated drug 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine in all prostate cancer lines. Prostate cancer cells invasion and migration were significantly suppressed by ectopic expression of DACT-2 in vitro.

The stabilization of rG4 structures formed within the pre-miRNA stem-loop regions using small ligands is an attractive anticancer strategy. Particularly, miRNA-149 is upregulated in a variety of cancers such as prostate cancer and is therefore a potential target for drug development. The results show that ligands C8 and PhenDC3 interact with the rG4 structure via stacking interactions with the end G-quartets. Ligands [16]phenN2, [32]phen2N4 and pyridostatin on the other hand bind the loops/groove interface of the rG4 being H-bonding and electrostatic interactions the driving force of the interaction. The C8 precursor, C8-NH2, emphasizes the structural nuances of the rG4 short loops as the lack of a large terminal aromatic moiety produced a mixed stacking-groove binding mode. Overall, this study may help the design of specific ligands for pre-miRNA rG4 towards anticancer therapeutics development.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

This study aimed to evaluate the association between survival and gait function prior to, immediately after and 6 weeks following radiotherapy for MSCC in PCa patients.Patient sample: All PCa patients admitted with MSCC at Rigshospitalet, Denmark from January 1, 2010 to December 31, 2011 were included. Patients were followed until death to analyze gait function as a prognostic factor.Methods: Of the 76 included patients, four patients underwent surgical decompression followed by radiotherapy and 72 patients received only radiotherapy. Gait was evaluated prior to radiotherapy, immediately after radiotherapy and at 6 weeks follow-up.Results: Before radiotherapy, 88% had normal gait function and 12% had complete loss of gait function. Corresponding percentages after radiotherapy were 72% and 28%, respectively. Median overall survival following MSCC was 4.9 months (95% CI = 3.6-6.2) with a 3-, 6-, and 12-months survival probability of 64%, 42%, and 21%, respectively. Multivariate analyses demonstrated that patients without gait function after radiotherapy had a 2.6-2.8-fold increased risk of dying compared to men with gait function. Patients with more than two vertebrae involved had a 2.3-3.4-fold increased risk of dying when compared to patients with 1-2 vertebral metastases.Conclusions: PCa patients with MSCC have a poor prognosis. Most likely reflecting differences in tumor burden, preserved gait function following radiotherapy is associated with better prognosis.

However, the effect of bifenthrin on cytosolic-free Ca2+ level ([Ca2+]i) and cytotoxicity in human prostate cancer cells is unclear. This study examined whether bifenthrin altered Ca2+ homeostasis and cell viability in PC3 human prostate cancer cells. [Ca2+]i in suspended cells were measured using the fluorescent Ca2+-sensitive dye fura-2. Cell viability was examined by 4-[3-[4-lodophenyl]-2-4(4-nitrophenyl)-2H-5-tetrazolio-1,3-benzene disulfonate] water soluble tetrazolium-1 assay. Bifenthrin (100-400 μM) concentration-dependently induced [Ca2+]i rises. Ca2+ removal reduced the signal by approximately 30%. In Ca2+-free medium, treatment with the endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ pump inhibitor 2,5-di-tert-butylhydroquinone (BHQ) abolished bifenthrin-evoked [Ca2+]i rises. Conversely, treatment with bifenthrin abolished BHQ-evoked [Ca2+]i rises. Inhibition of phospholipase C (PLC) with U73122 significantly inhibited bifenthrin-induced [Ca2+]i rises. Mn2+ has been shown to enter cells through similar mechanisms as Ca2+ but quenches fura-2 fluorescence at all excitation wavelengths. Bifenthrin (400 μM)-induced Mn2+ influx implicates that Ca2+ entry occurred. Bifenthrin-induced Ca2+ entry was inhibited by 30% by protein kinase C (PKC) activator (phorbol 12-myristate 13 acetate) and inhibitor (GF109203X) and three inhibitors of store-operated Ca2+ channels: nifedipine, econazole, and SKF96365. Bifenthrin at 175-275 μM decreased cell viability, which was not reversed by pretreatment with the Ca2+ chelator 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy) ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetra acetic acid-acetoxymethyl ester. Together, in PC3 cells, bifenthrin-induced [Ca2+]i rises by evoking PLC-dependent Ca2+ release from the endoplasmic reticulum and Ca2+ entry via PKC-sensitive store-operated Ca2+ entry.

Objective:   We hypothesised that the diagnostic performance of MRI for csPCa varies according to patient's age. To address this, we assessed the variation in the csPCa detection rate of MRI targeted biopsy (MRI-TBx) versus systematic random biopsy (SBx) across different patient ages.  Design, setting, and participants:   We retrospectively identified 930 patients who underwent prostate MRI and subsequent biopsy at two referral centres between 2013 and 2018. The Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) was used for MRI reporting.  Intervention:   A lesion with a PI-RADS score of ≥3 detected at MRI received an MRI-TBx in addition to an SBx during the same session.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   The outcome of our study was the relationship between age and csPCa detection rate at MRI-TBx and SBx, respectively. Clinically significant prostate cancer (PCa) was defined as the presence of PCa with Gleason score ≥3+4. Multivariable logistic regression analyses (MVAs) predicting csPCa detection were assessed for both MRI-TBx and SBx. Covariates were age, prostate-specific antigen density, PI-RADS score, previous biopsy status, digital rectal examination, and the number of targeted and systematic cores. The hypothesis that MRI accuracy in detecting csPCa differed by age was finally tested with a nonparametric loess analysis.  Results and limitations:   The overall rate of csPCa was 54% (n=506). Overall, 325 (35%) and 461 (50%) patients had csPCa at SBx and MRI-TBx, respectively. The median numbers of SBx and MRI-TBx cores were 12 (interquartile range [IQR]: 10-13) and 5 (IQR: 4-7), respectively. At MVA, age at biopsy was an independent predictor of csPCa at MRI-TBx only (odds ratio: 1.05), after accounting for confounders. In men aged less than roughly 50yr, SBx had a higher probability of detecting csPCa relative to MRI-TBx (25% vs 16% at 40yr). Conversely, in patients aged >50yr, the probability of csPCa was higher in MRI-TBx than in SBx, reaching the highest difference for very elderly patients (48% vs 68% at 80yr). The main limitations were the retrospective design and the small number of young patients.  Conclusions:   In this study, we reported the performance of MRI and MRI-TBx in detecting csPCa changes according to patients' age.  Patient summary:   In young patients, the performance of a systematic random biopsy in detecting clinically significant prostate cancer (csPCa) is higher relative to magnetic resonance imaging targeted biopsy (MRI-TBx), reflecting the lower accuracy of MRI in younger men. Conversely, in older patients, MRI-TBx showed a clinical benefit with a higher csPCa detection rate compared with SBx, suggesting an increase of MRI accuracy with the increase of age.""","""['Armando Stabile', ""Paolo Dell'Oglio"", 'Matteo Soligo', 'Francesco De Cobelli', 'Giorgio Gandaglia', 'Nicola Fossati', 'Antonio Esposito', 'Giorgio Brembilla', 'R Jeffrey Karnes', 'Francesco Montorsi', 'Alberto Briganti']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Eur Urol Oncol""","""['Prostate cancer detection rate in men undergoing transperineal template-guided saturation and targeted prostate biopsy.', 'A clinical available decision support scheme for optimizing prostate biopsy based on mpMRI.', 'Does previous prostate surgery affect multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging accuracy in detecting clinically significant prostate cancer?

Because of its function on angiogenesis and overexpression in the prostate cancer, methionine aminopeptidase-2 (MetAP-2) has been a potential target for novel drug design recently.  Objective:   A novel series of Flurbiprofen derivatives N-(substituted)-2-(2-(2-fluoro-[1,1'- biphenyl]-4-il)propanoyl)hydrazinocarbothioamide (3a-c), 4-substituted-3-(1-(2-fluoro-[1,1'-biphenyl]- 4-yl)ethyl)-1H-1,2,4-triazole-5(4H)-thione (4a-d), 3-(substitutedthio)-4-(substituted-phenyl)- 5-(1-(2-fluoro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-4-yl)ethyl)-4H-1,2,4-triazole (5a-y) were synthesized. The purpose of the research was to evaluate these derivatives against MetAP-2 in vitro and in silico to obtain novel specific and effective anticancer agents against prostate cancer.  Methods:   The chemical structures and purities of the compounds were defined by spectral methods (1H-NMR, 13C-NMR, HR-MS and FT-IR) and elemental analysis. Anticancer activities of the compounds were evaluated in vitro by using MTS method against PC-3 and DU-143 (androgenindependent human prostate cancer cell lines) and LNCaP (androgen-sensitive human prostate adenocarcinoma) prostate cancer cell lines. Cisplatin was used as a positive sensitivity reference standard.  Results:   Compounds 5b and 5u; 3c, 5b and 5y; 4d and 5o showed the most potent biological activity against PC3 cancer cell line (IC50= 27.1 μM, and 5.12 μM, respectively), DU-145 cancer cell line (IC50= 11.55 μM, 6.9 μM and 9.54 μM, respectively) and LNCaP cancer cell line (IC50= 11.45 μM and 26.91 μM, respectively). Some compounds were evaluated for their apoptotic caspases protein expression (EGFR/PI3K/AKT pathway) by Western blot analysis in androgen independent- PC3 cells. BAX, caspase 9, caspsase 3 and anti-apoptotic BcL-2 mRNA levels of some compounds were also investigated. In addition, molecular modeling studies of the compounds on MetAP-2 enzyme active site were evaluated in order to get insight into binding mode and energy.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the relationship of testosterone and CgA to grades and stages of prostate cancer, particularly whether low-serum testosterone and high-serum CgA are associated with more aggressive grades, and higher pathological stages of the disease.  Methods:   This perspective study included 121 men (Caucasian only) presenting with -newly-diagnosed, untreated prostate cancer. All the patients underwent radical prostatectomy.  Results:   We subdivided the sample into two homogeneous groups, Group A with Gleason score ≤7 (3+4), and Group B with Gleason score ≥7 (4+3). Low testosterone (< 3 ng/ml) was most common among the members of Group B 80 % versus 12.6 % of Group A (p = 0.001). At the same time, elevated CgA (> 80 ng/ml) was present for a rate of 72 % in Group B, 28.1% in the Group A ( p = 0.001).

Intermittent androgen suppression (IAS) is the method which stops and resumes hormone therapy repeatedly. The efficacy of IAS differs depending on patients; both the cases have been reported where the relapse of cancer happened and did not happen, for the patients who had undergone IAS. For the patients who cannot avoid the relapse of cancer by IAS, we should delay the relapse of cancer as later as possible. Here we compared some practical methods of determining when to stop and restart hormone therapy for IAS using an existing mathematical model of prostate cancer. The method we suggest is to determine the ratio of on-treatment period and off-treatment period sparsely for each cycle, namely the ""sparse search."" We also compared the performance of the sparse search with the exhaustive search and the model predictive control. We found that the sparse search can find a good treatment schedule without failure, and the computational cost is not so high compared to the exhaustive method. In addition, we focus on the model predictive control (MPC) method which has been applied to the scheduling of IAS in some existing studies. The MPC is computationary efficient, although it does not always find an optimal schedule in the numerical experiments here. We believe that the MPC method might be also promising because of its reasonable computational costs and its possibility of expanding of the model.""","""['Ayako Nakanishi', 'Yoshito Hirata']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""J Theor Biol""","""['Model predictive control for optimally scheduling intermittent androgen suppression of prostate cancer.', 'Mathematical modeling of continuous and intermittent androgen suppression for the treatment of advanced prostate cancer.', 'A new protocol for intermittent androgen suppression therapy of prostate cancer with unstable saddle-point dynamics.', 'Mathematically modelling and controlling prostate cancer under intermittent hormone therapy.', 'Intermittent androgen suppression for prostate cancer.', 'High Accuracy Indicators of Androgen Suppression Therapy Failure for Prostate Cancer-A Modeling Study.', 'Modeling the synergistic properties of drugs in hormonal treatment for prostate cancer.']"""

Indeed, in the latter context, CCN3 has been shown to sequester the androgen receptor (AR) and suppress AR signaling. In the present study, we demonstrate that CCN3 functions as a bone-metastatic mediator, which is dependent on its C-terminal domain for this function. Analysis of tissue microarrays comprising >1500 primary PC patient radical prostatectomy specimens reveals that CCN3 expression correlates with aggressive disease and is negatively correlated with the expression of prostate-specific antigen, a marker of AR signaling.

Moreover, there is significant variation in the methods and constructs used to create area-level indices.  Methods:   In this study, we introduced a psychometrically-induced, reproducible approach to develop area-level HSS and SES indices. We assessed the utility of these indices in detecting the effects of area-level characteristics on prostate, breast, and lung cancer incidence and stage at diagnosis in the US. The information on county-level SES and HSS characteristics were extracted from US Census, County Business Patterns data and Area Health Resource Files. The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database was used to identify individuals diagnosed with cancer from 2010 to 2012. SES and HSS indices were developed and linked to 3-year age-adjusted cancer incidence rates. SES and HSS indices empirically summarized the level of employment, education, poverty and income, and the availability of health care facilities and health professionals within counties.  Results:   SES and HSS models demonstrated good fit (TLI = 0.98 and 0.96, respectively) and internal consistency (alpha = 0.85 and 0.95, respectively). Increasing SES and HSS were associated with increasing prostate and breast cancer and decreasing lung cancer incidence rates. The results varied by stage at diagnosis and race.

We aimed to elucidate the function of miR-193b and identify its critical targets in prostate cancer. We observed an inverse correlation between miR-193b level and methylation of its promoter in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) cohort. Overexpression of miR-193b in prostate cancer cell lines inhibited invasion and induced apoptosis. We found that a majority of the top 150 genes downregulated when miR-193b was overexpressed in liposarcoma are overexpressed in metastatic prostate cancer and that 41 miR-193b target genes overlapped with the 86 genes in the aggressive prostate cancer subtype 1 (PCS1) signature. Overexpression of miR-193b led to the inhibition of the majority of the 41 genes in prostate cancer cell lines. High expression of the 41 genes was correlated with recurrence of prostate cancer. Knockdown of miR-193b targets FOXM1 and RRM2 in prostate cancer cells phenocopied overexpression of miR-193b. Dual treatment with DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) and histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors decreased miR-193b promoter methylation and restored inhibition of FOXM1 and RRM2.

Studies of these biomarkers typically provide information about diagnostic performance but not about overdiagnosis and lives saved, the primary drivers of associated harm and benefit.  Methods:   We projected overdiagnoses and lives saved using an established microsimulation model of PCa incidence and mortality with screening and treatment efficacy based on randomized trials. We used this framework to evaluate four urinary reflex biomarkers (measured in 1112 men presenting for prostate biopsy at 10 US academic or community clinics) and two hypothetical ideal biomarkers (with 100% sensitivity or specificity for any or for high-grade PCa) at one-time screening tests at ages 55 and 65 years.  Results:   Compared with biopsying all men with elevated PSA, reflex testing reduced overdiagnoses (range across ages and biomarkers = 8.8-60.6%) but also reduced lives saved (by 7.3-64.9%), producing similar overdiagnoses per life saved. The ideal biomarker for high-grade disease improved this ratio (by 35.2% at age 55 years and 42.0% at age 65 years). Results were similar under continued screening for men not diagnosed at age 55 years, but the ideal biomarker for high-grade disease produced smaller incremental improvement.  Conclusions:   Modeling is a useful tool for projecting the implications of using reflex biomarkers for long-term PCa outcomes. Under simplified conditions, reflex testing with urinary biomarkers is expected to reduce overdiagnoses but also produce commensurate reductions in lives saved.

It has the potential for growth and later cause metastasis. After radical prostatectomy, the detection of circulating prostate cells (CPCs) and bone marrow micro-metastasis could represent different types of MRD. We proposed to determine the biochemical failure free survival rates, the time to biochemical failure after 10 years of follow-up and the presence of CPCs and micro-metastasis in patients treated with RP for pathologically organ confined prostate cancer.  Methods and patients:   One month after RP monotherapy for prostate cancer, blood and bone marrow samples were taken to detect CPCs and micro-metastasis. Men were classified as: group A (CPC negative and micro-metastasis negative), group B (CPC negative and micro-metastasis positive), group C (CPC positive and micro-metastasis negative), and group D (CPC positive and micro-metastasis positive). All subjects were followed with serial total PSA levels, recording the time at which failure occurred defined as a serum PSA > 0.2ng/ ml on two separate occasions. After ten years of follow- up for each group Kaplan-Meier survival curves were determined and using an adjusted flexible parametric model (FP), the Restricted Mean Survival Times for groups A, B, C and D were calculated. RESULTS: 191 men participated, 10-year biochemical failure survival rates were; group A (N=114) with a Kaplan-Meier of 98.7%; group B (N=39) 65.1%; group C (N=12) 10.4% and in group D (N=28) 12.8%. The Restricted Mean Survival Times (years) were group A: 9.95; group B: 9.45, group C: 5.11 and group D: 6.18 (p-value <0.001 between groups: A versus C, Aversus D, B versus C and B versus D). Frequency and time to failure was dependent on the type of MRD, those men CPC positive had a significantly higher failure rate and early failure. Those men only micro-metastasis positive had lower failure rate and late failure when compared with men negative for MRD.  Conclusions:   CPC positive men have a more aggressive disease with increased early failure; those men who are only positive for micro-metastasis are at risk for late or delayed failure. These two forms of measuring MRD represent different stages in the disease progression and may be used to guide clinical treatment decisions before increases in PSA levels.""","""['Nigel P Murray', 'Sócrates Aedo', 'Cynthia Fuentealba', 'Eduardo Reyes', 'Simona Minzer', 'Aníbal Salazar']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Arch Esp Urol""","""['Circulating prostate cells and bone marrow micro-metastasis and not treatment modality determine the risk and time to biochemical failure in low risk prostate cancer..', 'Minimum Residual Disease in Patients Post Radical Prostatectomy for Prostate Cancer: Theoretical Considerations, Clinical Implications and Treatment Outcome.', 'Subtypes of minimal residual disease, association with Gleason score, risk and time to biochemical failure in pT2 prostate cancer treated with radical prostatectomy.', 'Prostate specific antigen only progression of prostate cancer.', 'The presence of secondary circulating prostate tumour cells determines the risk of biochemical relapse for patients with low- and intermediate-risk prostate cancer who are treated only with external radiotherapy.']"""

RESULTS: A total of 1156 new cases of PC were analyzed with a mean age of 68.2 years and a mean PSA of 8.40 ng/ml. The Gleason score (GS) showed 538 (46.2%), 418 (35.9 %) and 200 (17.1%) patients for GS ≤ 6, 7 and ≥ 8 respectively. 91% of patients (1053 patients) are diagnosed at a localized stage. 56 (4.8%) patients received treatment with active surveillance/ watchful waiting, 423 (36.6%) radical prostatectomy (PR), 348 (30.1%) radiotherapy (RT), 98 (8.4%) brachytherapy (BT) and 170 (14.7%) hormone therapy (HT) respectively.  Conclusions:   Differed strategies still accounted for a small percentage of treatments. PR and RT/BT were of choice in patients with localized stages of the disease and younger than 70 years. More advanced stages and older patients were treated with HT mainly. Age is postulated as the main factor involved in therapeutic decision making.""","""['Álvaro Julio Virseda-Rodríguez', 'Sara Marcos Asensio', 'Juan Jesús Núñez-Otero', 'Fructuoso García', 'Alejandro Sanz', 'Emilio Gutiérrez', 'José María Serrano', 'Sebastián Valverde', 'Carlos Polo', 'José Heriberto Amón-Sesmero', 'Verónica Rodríguez', 'Ramón Cortiñas', 'Jesús Calleja', 'Miguel Adriazola', 'Lucía Gala', 'Raul Bermúdez', 'Ignacio Moya', 'Ryszard Szczesniewski', 'Miguel Ángel López-Aramburu', 'Francisco Gómez-Veiga']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Arch Esp Urol""","""['Management of localised prostate cancer: watchful waiting, surgery or radiation therapy, depending on the natural course, which is often relatively slow.', 'Adverse Disease Features in Gleason Score 3 + 4 ""Favorable Intermediate-Risk"" Prostate Cancer: Implications for Active Surveillance.', 'The Prostate Cancer Intervention Versus Observation Trial: VA/NCI/AHRQ Cooperative Studies Program #407 (PIVOT): design and baseline results of a randomized controlled trial comparing radical prostatectomy with watchful waiting for men with clinically localized prostate cancer.', 'Limitations in Predicting Organ Confined Prostate Cancer in Patients with Gleason Pattern 4 on Biopsy: Implications for Active Surveillance.', 'An evidence review of active surveillance in men with localized prostate cancer.']"""

In this study, we hypothesized that WTC dust, which contained carcinogens and tumor-promoting agents, could facilitate prostate cancer development by inducing DNA damage, promoting cell proliferation, and causing chronic inflammation. We compared expression of immunologic and inflammatory genes using a NanoString assay on archived prostate tumors from WTC Health Program (WTCHP) patients and non-WTC patients with prostate cancer. Furthermore, to assess immediate and delayed responses of prostate tissue to acute WTC dust exposure via intratracheal inhalation, we performed RNA-seq on the prostate of normal rats that were exposed to moderate to high doses of WTC dust. WTC prostate cancer cases showed significant upregulation of genes involved in DNA damage and G2-M arrest. Cell-type enrichment analysis showed that Th17 cells, a subset of proinflammatory Th cells, were specifically upregulated in WTC patients. In rats exposed to WTC dust, we observed upregulation of gene transcripts of cell types involved in both adaptive immune response (dendritic cells and B cells) and inflammatory response (Th17 cells) in the prostate. Unexpectedly, genes in the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway were also significantly upregulated 30 days after acute dust exposure. Our results suggest that respiratory exposure to WTC dust can induce inflammatory and immune responses in prostate tissue. IMPLICATIONS: WTC-related prostate cancer displayed a distinct gene expression pattern that could be the result of exposure to specific carcinogens.

Methods:   We used SEER data for patients diagnosed in 2000 to 2013, followed-up through December 31, 2014. For RS, we used new life tables accounting for geography and socio-economic status. For CSS, we used the SEER cause of death algorithm for attributing cancer-specific death. Estimates were compared by site, age, stage, race, and time since diagnosis.  Results:   Differences between 5-year RS and CSS were generally small. RS was always higher in screen-detectable cancers, for example, female breast (89.2% vs. 87.8%) and prostate (98.5% vs. 93.7%) cancers; differences increased with age or time since diagnosis. CSS was usually higher in the remaining cancer sites, particularly those related to specific risk factors, for example, cervix (70.9% vs. 68.3%) and liver (20.7% vs. 17.1%) cancers. For most cancer sites, the gap between estimates was smaller with more advanced stage.Conclusion: RS is the preferred approach to report cancer survival from registry data because cause of death may be inaccurate, particularly for older patients and long-term survivors as comorbidities increase challenges in determining cause of death. However, CSS proved to be more reliable in patients diagnosed with localized disease or cancers related to specific risk factors as general population life tables may not capture other causes of mortality.

This study investigated whether the distribution of metastases across anatomic regions is prognostic of progression-free survival.  Patients and methods:   Fifty-four mCRPC patients with osseous metastases received baseline NaF PET/CT. Patients received chemotherapy (n = 16) or androgen receptor pathway inhibitors (n = 38). Semiautomated analysis using Quantitative Total Bone Imaging software extracted imaging metrics for the whole, axial, and appendicular skeleton as well as 11 skeletal regions. Five PET metrics were extracted for each region: number of lesions (NL), standardized maximum uptake value (SUVmax), average uptake (SUVmean), sum of uptake (SUVtotal), and diseased fraction of the skeleton (volume fraction). Progression included that discovered by clinical, biochemical, or radiographic means. Univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression analyses were performed between imaging metrics and progression-free survival, and were assessed according to their hazard ratios (HR) and concordance (C)-indices.  Results:   The strongest univariate models of progression-free survival were pelvic NL and SUVmax with HR = 1.80 (NL: false discovery rate adjusted P = .001, SUVmax: adjusted P = .001). Three other region-specific metrics (axial NL: HR = 1.59, adjusted P = .02, axial SUVmax: HR = 1.61, adjusted P = .02, and skull SUVmax: HR = 1.58, adjusted P = .04) were found to be stronger prognosticators relative to their whole-body counterparts. Multivariate model including region-specific metrics (C-index = 0.727) outperformed that of whole-body metrics (C-index = 0.705). The best performance was obtained when region-specific and whole-body metrics were included (C-index = 0.742).

Androgen Receptor (AR) signaling plays the central role in progression of Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer (CRPC), therefore understanding the mechanisms of AR activation in the milieu of low androgen is critical to discover novel approach to treat CRPC.  Methods:   Firstly, we explore the CRPC associated lncRNAs by transcriptome microarray. The expression and clinical features of lnc-LBCS are analyzed in three independent large-scale cohorts. The functional role and mechanism of lnc-LBCS are further investigated by gain and loss of function assays in vitro.  Results:   The expression of Lnc-LBCS was lower in CRPC cells lines and tissues. LBCS downregulation was correlated with higher Gleason Score, T stage and poor prognosis of PCa patients. LBCS overexpression decreases, whereas LBCS knockdown increases, the traits of castration resistance in prostate cancer cells under androgen ablated or AR blocked condition. Moreover, knockdown of LBCS was sufficient to activate AR signaling in the absence of androgen by elevating the translation of AR protein. Mechanistically, LBCS interacted directly with hnRNPK to suppress AR translation efficiency by forming complex with hnRNPK and AR mRNA.  Conclusions:   Lnc-LBCS functions as a novel AR translational regulator that suppresses castration resistance of prostate cancer by interacting with hnRNPK. This sheds a new insight into the regulation of CRPC by lncRNA mediated AR activation and LBCS-hnRNPK-AR axis provides a promising approach to the treatment of CRPC.""","""['Peng Gu', 'Xu Chen', 'Ruihui Xie', 'Weibin Xie', 'Li Huang', 'Wen Dong', 'Jinli Han', 'Xiaodong Liu', 'Jihong Shen', 'Jian Huang', 'Tianxin Lin']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Mol Cancer""","""['Long Noncoding RNA LBCS Inhibits Self-Renewal and Chemoresistance of Bladder Cancer Stem Cells through Epigenetic Silencing of SOX2.', 'Orphan nuclear receptor TLX contributes to androgen insensitivity in castration-resistant prostate cancer via its repression of androgen receptor transcription.', 'lncRNA HOXD-AS1 Regulates Proliferation and Chemo-Resistance of Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer via Recruiting WDR5.', 'Androgen receptor: what we know and what we expect in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'The concept and mechanisms of castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'The mechanisms and diagnostic potential of lncRNAs, miRNAs, and their related signaling pathways in cervical cancer.', 'Molecular Mechanisms of Noncoding RNA in the Occurrence of Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'ELK1-mediated YTHDF1 drives prostate cancer progression by facilitating the translation of Polo-like kinase 1 in an m6A dependent manner.', 'Identification and validation of a tyrosine metabolism-related prognostic prediction model and characterization of the tumor microenvironment infiltration in hepatocellular carcinoma.', 'A New Long Noncoding RNA, MAHAT, Inhibits Replication of Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome Virus by Recruiting DDX6 To Bind to ZNF34 and Promote an Innate Immune Response.']"""

In this work, we proposed a transfer learning-based deep learning approach, for classification of prostate lesions in multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging images.  Methods:   Magnetic resonance imaging images were preprocessed to remove bias artifact and normalize the data. Two state-of-the-art deep convolutional neural network models, InceptionV3 and VGG-16, were pretrained on ImageNet data set and retuned on the multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging data set. As lesion appearances differ by the prostate zone that it resides in, separate models were trained. Ensembling was performed on each prostate zone to improve area under the curve. In addition, the predictions from lesions on each prostate zone were scaled separately to increase the area under the curve for all lesions combined.  Results:   The models were tuned to produce the highest area under the curve on validation data set. When it was applied to the unseen test data set, the transferred InceptionV3 model achieved an area under the curve of 0.81 and the transferred VGG-16 model achieved an area under the curve of 0.83. This was the third best score among the 72 methods from 33 participating groups in ProstateX competition.

In this study, we present a compact solution allowing estimation of physiological parameters K trans and v e from ultrafast DCE acquisitions, without fitting DCE-MRI data to the standard Tofts pharmacokinetic model. Since the standard Tofts model can be simplified to the Patlak model at early times when contrast efflux from the extravascular extracellular space back to plasma is negligible, K trans can be solved explicitly for a specific time. Further, v e can be estimated directly from the late steady-state signal using the derivative form of Tofts model. Ultrafast DCE-MRI data were acquired from 18 prostate cancer patients on a Philips Achieva 3T-TX scanner. Regions-of-interest (ROIs) for prostate cancer, normal tissue, gluteal muscle, and iliac artery were manually traced. The contrast media concentration as function of time was calculated over each ROI using gradient echo signal equation with pre-contrast tissue T1 values, and using the 'reference tissue' model with a linear approximation. There was strong correlation (r = 0.88-0.91, p < 0.0001) between K trans extracted from the Tofts model and K trans estimated from the compact solution for prostate cancer and normal tissue. Additionally, there was moderate correlation (r = 0.65-0.73, p < 0.0001) between extracted versus estimated v e. Bland-Altman analysis showed moderate to good agreement between physiological parameters extracted from the Tofts model and those estimated from the compact solution with absolute bias less than 0.20 min-1 and 0.10 for K trans and v e, respectively. The compact solution may decrease systematic errors and error propagation, and could increase the efficiency of clinical workflow.

Study design:   Trends were estimated using joinpoint regression, and the net age, period, and cohort effects were estimated by an age-period-cohort (APC) model with an intrinsic estimator (IE) algorithm.  Methods:   Age-specific mortality rates of prostate cancer (1990-2017) were collected from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2017 study, and the average annual percent change (AAPC) and relative risks (RRs) analyzed by joinpoint regression and APC model.  Results:   Age-standardized rates significantly rose by 2.75% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.6, 2.9) for incidence but declined by 0.26% (95% CI: -0.4, -0.2) for mortality from 1990 to 2017. The joinpoint regression analysis showed that incidence rates significantly rose in all age groups, but mortality rates decreased in these age groups over the past three decades. In addition, compared to the younger age groups (15-19, 20-24, 25-29, 30-34, 35-39 and 40-44 age group), the older age groups (50-54, 55-59, 60-64 and 75-79 age group) showed more substantial increases in incidence and slighter declines in mortality. The age effect on incidence and mortality showed sharp increasing trends from 40 to 79 years, and period effect showed both of them continuously increased with advancing period, but cohort effect showed substantial decreasing trends from 1917-1921 to 2002-2006 birth cohort.  Conclusions:   Age effect on incidence and mortality presented an increasing trend in older people, and period effect showed increasing trends. The incidence rate of prostate cancer is increasing at an alarming rate in all age groups, which may adversely impact the mortality rates. Mortality began to increase since 2005; thus, timely intervention should be conducted, especially for earlier birth cohorts at high risk.""","""['X Liu', 'C Yu', 'Y Bi', 'Z J Zhang']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Public Health""","""['Trends in the Incidence and Mortality of Diabetes in China from 1990 to 2017: A Joinpoint and Age-Period-Cohort Analysis.', 'Long-Term Trends of Liver Cancer Incidence and Mortality in China 1990-2017: A Joinpoint and Age-Period-Cohort Analysis.', 'Different trends in colorectal cancer mortality between age groups in China: an age-period-cohort and joinpoint analysis.', 'Patterns and trends in prostate cancer incidence, survival, prevalence and mortality.

In an attempt to knockout of Lcn2 expression by CRISPR/Cas 9 technology in a highly aggressive and invasive prostate cancer cell line and to evaluate the combination therapy with cisplatin (CDDP), this study was conducted.  Main methods:   Control CRISPR/Cas9 plasmid and homology-directed repair plasmid or validated human Lcn2 CRISPR/Cas9 KO plasmids were co-transfected into PC3 cells using fugene HD transfection reagent. The stable cells were selected in the presence of puromycin. Correspondingly, knock out of Lcn2 was evaluated by RT-PCR, ELISA, and immunocytochemistry. PC3-Scr (control) and Lcn2-KO (PC3 cells in which lcn2 has been knocked out) were treated with or without cisplatin (CDDP). Cell proliferative ability was measured by WST-1 and colony-formation assays. Apoptosis was evaluated by DAPI staining, in situ cell death detection (TUNEL) assay, and cell death detection ELISA plus methods. The migration capabilities were studied by wound healing/scratch and transwell assays.  Key findings:   Lcn2 knock out in a highly aggressive and invasive cancer cell like PC3 decreased cell proliferation and increased the sensitivity of CDDP. Conspicuously, loss of Lcn2 expression effectively enhanced CDDP-induced apoptosis in PC3 cells. Lcn2 knock out by CRISPR/Cas9 technology decreased the cell migration capacity of PC3 cells as well.

Patients and methods:   We assessed post-SRT PSA progression-free survival (PFS) in 555 patients with prostate cancer. The entire cohort was compared with a risk-adjusted subgroup of 112 patient pairs with matching pre-RP PSA level (±10 ng/mL), Gleason score (≤6 vs 7 vs ≥8), and pre-SRT PSA level (±0.5 ng/mL).  Results:   The median follow-up was 6.1 years. After RP, PSA was undetectable in 422 and persistent in 133 patients. PSA persistence and a pre-SRT PSA level of ≥0.5 ng/mL reduced Kaplan-Meier rates of PFS significantly. In multivariate analysis of the entire cohort and after risk adjustment, the pre-SRT PSA level but not post-RP PSA persistence was a significant parameter. In the matched cohort's subgroup with early SRT at a PSA level of <0.5 ng/mL, a trend towards a worse outcome with post-RP PSA persistence was observed. Delayed SRT with a PSA level ≥0.5 ng/mL led to a PFS of <30%, irrespective of the post-RP PSA level.  Conclusion:   In patients with N0 prostate cancer with post-RP PSA persistence, early SRT at a PSA level <0.5 ng/mL seems to be less effective than in recurrent patients with post-RP undetectable PSA. They might benefit from intensified therapy, but larger case numbers are required to substantiate this conclusion.

Even when MR images are acquired for treatment planning, the standard clinical practice currently also requires a CT for dose calculation and x-ray-based patient positioning. This increases workloads, introduces uncertainty due to the required inter-modality image registrations, and involves unnecessary irradiation. While it would be beneficial to use exclusively MR images, a method needs to be employed to estimate a synthetic CT (sCT) for generating electron density maps and patient positioning reference images. We investigated 2D and 3D convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to generate a male pelvic sCT using a T1-weighted MR image and compare their performance.  Methods:   A retrospective study was performed using CTs and T1-weighted MR images of 20 prostate cancer patients. CTs were deformably registered to MR images to create CT-MR pairs for training networks. The proposed 2D CNN, which contained 27 convolutional layers, was modified from the state-of-the-art 2D CNN to save computational memory and prepare for building the 3D CNN. The proposed 2D and 3D models were trained from scratch to map intensities of T1-weighted MR images to CT Hounsfield Unit (HU) values. Each sCT was generated in a fivefold cross-validation framework and compared with the corresponding deformed CT (dCT) using voxel-wise mean absolute error (MAE). The sCT geometric accuracy was evaluated by comparing bone regions, defined by thresholding at 150 HU in the dCTs and the sCTs, using dice similarity coefficient (DSC), recall, and precision. To evaluate sCT patient positioning accuracy, bone regions in dCTs and sCTs were rigidly registered to the corresponding cone-beam CTs. The resulting paired Euler transformation vectors were compared by calculating translation vector distances and absolute differences of Euler angles. Statistical tests were performed to evaluate the differences among the proposed models and Han's model.  Results:   Generating a pelvic sCT required approximately 5.5 s using the proposed models. The average MAEs within the body contour were 40.5 ± 5.4 HU (mean ± SD) and 37.6 ± 5.1 HU for the 2D and 3D CNNs, respectively. The average DSC, recall, and precision for the bone region (thresholding the CT at 150 HU) were 0.81 ± 0.04, 0.85 ± 0.04, and 0.77 ± 0.09 for the 2D CNN, and 0.82 ± 0.04, 0.84 ± 0.04, and 0.80 ± 0.08 for the 3D CNN, respectively. For both models, mean translation vector distances are less than 0.6 mm with mean absolute differences of Euler angles less than 0.5°.  Conclusions:   The 2D and 3D CNNs generated accurate pelvic sCTs for the 20 patients using T1-weighted MR images. Statistical tests indicated that the proposed 3D model was able to generate sCTs with smaller MAE and higher bone region precision compared to 2D models. Results of patient alignment tests suggested that sCTs generated by the proposed CNNs can provide accurate patient positioning. The accuracy of the dose calculation using generated sCTs will be tested and compared for the proposed models in the future.""","""['Jie Fu', 'Yingli Yang', 'Kamal Singhrao', 'Dan Ruan', 'Fang-I Chu', 'Daniel A Low', 'John H Lewis']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Dosimetric evaluation of synthetic CT for head and neck radiotherapy generated by a patch-based three-dimensional convolutional neural network.', 'MR-based synthetic CT generation using a deep convolutional neural network method.', 'Patch-based generative adversarial neural network models for head and neck MR-only planning.', 'Automatic Segmentation of Multiple Organs on 3D CT Images by Using Deep Learning Approaches.', 'Deep learning methods to generate synthetic CT from MRI in radiotherapy: A literature review.', 'Research progress on deep learning in magnetic resonance imaging-based diagnosis and treatment of prostate cancer: a review on the current status and perspectives.', 'Artificial intelligence applications in prostate cancer.', 'Enhancing Disease Classification in Abdominal CT Scans through RGB Superposition Methods and 2D Convolutional Neural Networks: A Study of Appendicitis and Diverticulitis.', 'Deep Learning in MRI-guided Radiation Therapy: A Systematic Review.', 'Synthetic cranial MRI from 3D optical surface scans using deep learning for radiation therapy treatment planning.']"""

A texture analysis was performed on the metastatic lesions showing PSMA expression and completely responded sclerotic lesions without PSMA expression through CT images. Textural features were compared in two groups. Thus, the distinction of metastasis/completely responded lesions and the most effective parameters in this issue were determined by using various methods [decision tree, discriminant analysis, support vector machine (SVM), k-nearest neighbor (KNN), ensemble classifier] in machine learning.  Results:   In 28 of the 35 texture analysis findings, there was a statistically significant difference between the two groups.

In this study, we developed an efficient colorimetric bioassay based on switchable linkers (SLs) for the detection of prostate-specific antigen (PSA), which is one of the most widely used protein biomarkers for the diagnosis of prostate and breast cancers. SLs can cross-link gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) to generate large-scale aggregates and thereby induce precipitation to achieve visual signal amplification. In addition, when SLs are occupied by target proteins (referred to as 'switch-off'), highly sensitive detection is enabled.

Nevertheless, there are few qualitative studies exploring ""how"" pharmacist-patient communication occurs and none targets patients with cancer.  Objective:   To describe the perceptions of outpatients with prostate cancer regarding the communication process during clinical pharmacy service in a community pharmacy.  Methods:   A qualitative study was performed from semistructured interviews with 10 patients. These interviews were audiotape-recorded and transcribed comprehensively, and the data were analyzed using content analysis. The validation of the categories and registration units was made by 2 independent authors and reviewed by a third author.  Results:   Three categories were established from the content analysis (general perceptions of the pharmacist-patient communication, potentialities of effective communication, and points for improvement). Communication is a complex process and involves, in addition to information exchange, the sharing of thoughts, desires, and fears. Our findings hold that effective communication skills by pharmacist can help patients validate their concerns, develop a trusting patient-pharmacist relationship, address drug therapy problems, and lead to better health outcomes.  Conclusion:   Pharmacist-patient communication is an important strategy for humanized practice. This allows the pharmacist to see beyond an individual with health problems to a human being with particularized needs.""","""['Aline Scarabelin', 'Aline Santana Dosea', 'Patricia Melo Aguiar', 'Sílvia Storpirtis']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""J Patient Exp""","""['A meta-narrative review of recorded patient-pharmacist interactions: exploring biomedical or patient-centered communication?', 'Exploring successful community pharmacist-physician collaborative working relationships using mixed methods.', ""The impact of patients' perceptions of the listening skills of the pharmacist on their willingness to re-use Home Medicines Reviews: a structural equation model."", ""Exploring pharmacy service users' support for and willingness to use community pharmacist prescribing services."", 'Factors influencing patient participation in medication counseling at the community pharmacy: A systematic review.', 'Patient satisfaction impact indicators from a psychosocial perspective.']"""

In the initial stages, prostate cancer is often treated using hormone therapy, including bicalutamide. Despite the initial effectiveness of this therapy, the tumor eventually acquires resistance, resulting in recurrence of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Dysregulation of microRNA (miRNA) function is one of the putative underlying mechanisms of hormone therapy resistance. Reports have shown that miRNAs act as tumor suppressors in patients with prostate cancer, but the role of these molecules in bicalutamide resistance in prostate cancer cell lines remains unclear. We performed lentiviral miRNA library screening to identify novel miRNAs that modulate the response of human prostate cancer LNCaP cells to the antiandrogen bicalutamide. We found that the tumor suppressor miRNA miR-137 silenced signaling in a spectrum of human cancers and selectively targeted tripartite motif-containing 24 (TRIM24) to suppress tumor proliferation. Silencing of TRIM24 recapitulated the effect of miR-137 on cell proliferation, whereas overexpression of TRIM24 reversed this effect. Real-time reverse transcription PCR analysis revealed a reciprocal relationship between miR-137 and TRIM24 in prostate cancer cell lines and tissues. Mechanistic studies indicated that methyl CpG-binding protein 2 (MeCP2) and DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) cooperate to promote methylation of the miR-137 promoter and the consequent decreased transcription, leading to enhanced TRIM24 expression and glutamine metabolism. These findings describe a novel mechanism that affects TRIM24 deregulation in human cancers and provide a molecular link between miR-137, TRIM24, and tumor proliferation in CRPC.""","""['Yonghui Guan', 'Xiaoyue Guan', 'Hengqing An', 'Azhati Baihetiya', 'Wenguang Wang', 'Weimin Shao', 'Haiou Yang', 'Yujie Wang']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Am J Transl Res""","""['MicroRNA Library-Based Functional Screening Identified Androgen-Sensitive miR-216a as a Player in Bicalutamide Resistance in Prostate Cancer.', 'Linc00963 Promote Cell Proliferation and Tumor Growth in Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer by Modulating miR-655/TRIM24 Axis.', 'Regulation of TRIM24 by miR-511 modulates cell proliferation in gastric cancer.', 'Epigenetic silencing of microRNA-137 enhances ASCT2 expression and tumor glutamine metabolism.', 'MicroRNA-27a-5p regulation by promoter methylation and MYC signaling in prostate carcinogenesis.', 'Effect and Mechanism of lncRNA-PCMF1/hsa-miR-137/Twist1 Axis Involved in\xa0the EMT\xa0Regulation of Prostate Cancer Cells.', 'Exploration of the Potential Transcriptional Regulatory Mechanisms of DNA Methyltransferases and MBD Genes in Petunia Anther Development and Multi-Stress Responses.', 'Clinical Effects of Jiawei Danggui Beimu Kushen Pills in the Treatment of Prostate Cancer and Their Influence on the Expression of Serum Prostate Specific Antigen.', 'lncRNA DSCR8 mediates miR-137/Cdc42 to regulate gastric cancer cell proliferation, invasion, and cell cycle as a competitive endogenous RNA.', 'Suppression of ANT2 by miR-137 Inhibits Prostate Tumorigenesis.']"""

Down-regulation of the pro-apoptotic tumour suppressor protein prostate apoptosis response-4 (PAR-4) is required for breast cancer recurrence and resistance to chemotherapy. Recent advances in the analysis of apoptotic signalling networks have uncovered an important role for activation of caspase-8 following DNA damage by genotoxic drugs. DNA damage induces depletion of IAP proteins and causes caspase-8 activation by promoting the formation of a cytosolic cell death complex. We demonstrate that loss of PAR-4 in triple negative breast cancer cell lines (TNBC) mediates resistance to DNA damage-induced apoptosis and prevents activation of caspase-8. Moreover, loss of PAR-4 prevents DNA damage-induced cIAP1 depletion. PAR-4 functions downstream of caspase-8 by cleavage-induced nuclear translocation of the C-terminal part and we demonstrate that nuclear translocation of the C-terminal PAR-4 fragment leads to depletion of cIAP1 and subsequent caspase-8 activation. Specifically targeting cIAP1 with RNAi or Smac mimetics (LCL161) overcomes chemo-resistance induced by loss of PAR-4 and restores caspase-8 activation. Our data identify cIAP1 as important downstream mediator of PAR-4 and we provide evidence that combining Smac mimetics and genotoxic drugs creates vulnerability for synthetic lethality in TNBC cells lacking PAR-4.""","""['Haihong Guo', 'Fabian Treude', 'Oliver H Krämer', 'Bernhard Lüscher', 'Jörg Hartkamp']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Sci Rep""","""['LCL161 increases paclitaxel-induced apoptosis by degrading cIAP1 and cIAP2 in NSCLC.', 'LCL161, a SMAC-mimetic, Preferentially Radiosensitizes Human Papillomavirus-negative Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma.', 'PPARγ Ligand-induced Annexin A1 Expression Determines Chemotherapy Response via Deubiquitination of Death Domain Kinase RIP in Triple-negative Breast Cancers.', 'Mechanisms of apoptosis by the tumor suppressor Par-4.', 'Taking aim with IAP antagonists at triple-negative breast cancer: a moving target no more?', 'Anticancer genes (NOXA, PAR-4, TRAIL) are de-regulated in breast cancer patients and can be targeted by using a ribosomal inactivating plant protein (riproximin).', 'Three Members of Transmembrane-4-Superfamily, TM4SF1, TM4SF4, and TM4SF5, as Emerging Anticancer Molecular Targets against Cancer Phenotypes and Chemoresistance.', 'Curcumin Sensitizes 4T1 Murine Breast Cancer Cells to Cisplatin Through PAR4 Secretion.', 'Expression profiling of anticancer genes in colorectal cancer patients and their in vitro induction by riproximin, a ribosomal inactivating plant protein.', 'UACA locus is associated with breast cancer chemoresistance and survival.']"""

Using Type II Diabetes (T2D) as a test case, we develop measures and methods to characterize the functional overlap of SNPs associated with the same disease across populations.  Results:   We introduce the notion of an Overlap Matrix as a general means of characterizing the functional overlap between different SNP sets at different genomic and functional granularities. Using SNP-to-gene mapping, functional annotation databases, and functional association networks, we assess the degree of functional overlap across nine populations from Asian and European ethnic origins. We further assess the generalizability of the method by applying it to a dataset for another complex disease - Prostate Cancer. Our results show that more overlap is captured as more functional data is incorporated as we go through the pipeline, starting from SNPs and ending at network overlap analyses. We hypothesize that these observed differences in the functional mechanisms of T2D across populations can also explain the common use of different prescription drugs in different populations. We show that this hypothesis is concordant with the literature on the functional mechanisms of prescription drugs.  Conclusion:   Our results show that although the etiology of a complex disease can be associated with distinct processes that are affected in different populations, network-based annotations can capture more functional overlap across populations.

Better predictive biomarkers could allow for earlier detection of biochemical recurrence and change surveillance and adjuvant treatment paradigms. Circulating tumor cells are thought to represent the earliest form of metastases. However, their role as biomarkers in men with high risk, localized prostate cancer is not well defined.  Materials and methods:   Two to 5 months after prostatectomy we obtained blood samples from 37 patients with high risk, localized prostate cancer, defined as stage T3a or higher, Gleason score 8 or greater, or prostate specific antigen 20 ng/ml or greater. Circulating tumor cells were enumerated using a commercial platform. Matched tumor and single circulating tumor cell sequencing was performed.  Results:   Circulating tumor cells were detected in 30 of 37 samples (81.1%) with a median of 2.4 circulating tumor cells per ml (range 0 to 22.9). Patients with detectable circulating tumor cells showed a trend toward shorter recurrence time (p=0.12). All patients with biochemical recurrence had detectable circulating tumor cells. Androgen receptor over expression was detected in 7 of 37 patients (18.9%). Patients with biochemical recurrence had more circulating tumor cell copy number aberrations (p=0.027). Matched tumor tissue and single circulating tumor cell sequencing revealed heterogeneity.  Conclusions:   We noted a high incidence of circulating tumor cell detection after radical prostatectomy and shorter time to biochemical recurrence in men with a higher circulating tumor cell burden and more circulating tumor cell copy number aberrations. Genomic alterations consistent with established copy number aberrations in prostate cancer were detectable in circulating tumor cells but often discordant with cells analyzed in bulk from primary lesions.

However, the relationship between domain scores and functional outcomes remains unclear, leading to potential confusion about expectations after treatment. For instance, does a sexual function domain score of 80 mean that a patient can achieve erection sufficient for intercourse? Consequently we sought to determine the relationship between the domain score and the response to obtaining the best possible outcome for each question.  Materials and methods:   Using data from the CEASAR (Comparative Effectiveness Analysis of Surgery and Radiation) study, a multicenter, prospective study of men diagnosed with localized prostate cancer, we analyzed 11,464 EPIC-26 questionnaires from a total of 2,563 men at baseline through 60 months of followup who were treated with robotic prostatectomy, radiotherapy or active surveillance. We dichotomized every item into its best possible outcome and assessed the percent of men at each domain score who achieved the best result.  Results:   For every EPIC-26 item the frequency of the best possible outcome was reported by domain score category. For example, a score of 80 to 100 on sexual function corresponded to 97% of men reporting erections sufficient for intercourse while at a score of 40 to 60 only 28% reported adequate erections. Also, at a score of 80 to 100 on the urinary incontinence domain 93% of men reported rarely or never leaking vs 6% at a score of 61 to 80.

MATERIALS AND METHODS. The cohort of this retrospective study included 218 men with 240 unilateral PCa lesions assessed by both 3-T multiparametric MRI and whole-mount histopathologic analysis. ROIs were placed on individual lesions verified by WM histopathologic analysis, to calculate the mean ADC (ADCtumor_mean) and lowest ADC within each lesion (ADCtumor_min), and within non-tumor-containing regions of the same tumor zone but on the contralateral side (ADCbenign), to calculate the background ADC. The ADCratio_mean (the ADCtumor_mean divided by the ADCbenign) was calculated. The performance of individual ADCtumor and ADCratio_mean values in discriminating PCa with a GS of 3 + 3 from PCa with a GS of 3 + 4 or greater was assessed using the AUC value. RESULTS. The ADCratio_mean had a higher AUC value for discriminating PCa lesions with a GS of 3 + 3 from those with a GS of 3 + 4 or greater (the AUC value increased from 0.70 using the ADCtumor_mean and 0.67 using the ADCtumor_min [the minimum ADC of the PCa lesion] to 0.80 for the ADCratio_mean and 0.72 for the ADCratio_min [the ADCtumor_min divided by the ADCbenign]; p = 0.043).

When analyzed on the basis of endorectal coil use, the ADCratio_mean performed nonsignificantly better in both the endorectal coil and non-endorectal coil subcohorts, although it performed better in the former.

The purpose of this study is to show the performance and evaluate the factors influencing the positivity rate (PR) of commercially produced 18F-fluciclovine PET/CT in the detection of recurrent prostate cancer in clinical practice. MATERIALS AND METHODS. We performed a retrospective cohort study of 152 men who had suspected biochemical recurrence of prostate cancer after receiving initial treatment and underwent fluciclovine PET/CT. PRs were calculated for whole-body, prostate and prostate bed, and extraprostatic locations. The influence of different factors, such as the absolute prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level, PSA kinetics, the Gleason score, and Gleason grade groups, on the PR was evaluated. RESULTS. The overall PR was 81% (123/152) for the whole body, 61% (92/152) for the prostate and prostate bed, and 55% (83/152) for extraprostatic locations. There was a linear increase in the PR with an increasing PSA level (p < 0.001). For the whole body, the PR for PSA levels of less than 1 ng/mL, 1 to less than 2 ng/mL, 2 to less than 5 ng/mL, and 5 or more ng/mL were 58% (32/55), 87% (13/15), 100% (39/39), and 92% (35/38), respectively. No statistically significant linear trend was found between the PR and the PSA level doubling time (p > 0.05). In addition, no statistically significant linear trend was found between the PR and increasing Gleason grade group. However, for every 1-unit increase in a patient's Gleason score, the odds of a positive finding in the extraprostatic location increased by 49% (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION. Commercially produced fluciclovine PET/CT has a high PR for detection of prostate cancer recurrence and is positively correlated with increasing PSA levels.

The purpose of this study was to identify the sensitivity of contrast-enhanced CT in detecting high-grade prostate adenocarcinoma. MATERIALS AND METHODS. A retrospective analysis included 100 patients with prostate cancer proven by biopsy between January 2010 and December 2017 who underwent staging CT of the abdomen and pelvis within 3 months of diagnosis. The control subjects were 100 randomly selected aged-matched male outpatients with no known history of malignancy who underwent contrast-enhanced CT of the abdomen and pelvis in the same time period as the patients with cancer. Two readers, blinded to both groups, independently assessed the likelihood of prostate cancer on the basis of the CT finding of focal abnormally increased peripheral enhancement in the prostate. Binary classification of sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) was used to assess the diagnostic utility of CT versus the reference standard of transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsy.

However, this phenomenon is poorly understood among high risk (1 in 4) Black African (BA)/Black Caribbean (BC) men and their partners, as they are currently under-represented in global research on CaP survivorship. This study explored the psychosocial experiences of BA/BC men with CaP and their partners in the United Kingdom as they lived through the side effects of CaP treatment within their own sociocultural and marital contexts.  Methods:   Using constructivist grounded theory methodology, interviews and focus groups were conducted with eligible men (n = 25), partners (n = 11), and health care professionals (HCPs) (n = 11) recruited in England. Data were iteratively analysed using constant comparison following the key stages of initial, focused, and theoretical coding until saturation was achieved.  Results:   Data analysis culminated in the development of a substantive theory ""man in the driving seat,"" which describes the experiences of BA/BC men with CaP and their partners within their context. Culturally informed gender roles and identities influenced how men and partners responded and coped with the side effects of CaP treatment. There was a hierarchy of power within the BA/BC relationship, in which men were dominantly positioned as leaders, whilst partners mostly operated from a supportive but ""accepting"" position.  Conclusion:   Inclusive and culturally sensitive individual and couple-focused psychosocial support, which is devoid of stereotyping and recognises the experiences of both BA/BC men and their partners is recommended.""","""['Olufikayo Bamidele', 'Helen McGarvey', 'Briege M Lagan', 'Kader Parahoo', 'Frank Chinegwundoh Mbe', 'Eilís McCaughan']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Psychooncology""","""['""…It might not have occurred to my husband that this woman, his wife who is taking care of him has some emotional needs as well…"": the unheard voices of partners of Black African and Black Caribbean men with prostate cancer.', 'A constructivist grounded theory study on decision-making for treatment choice among Black African and Black Caribbean prostate cancer survivors.', 'Adjustment strategies amongst black African and black Caribbean men following treatment for prostate cancer: Findings from the Life After Prostate Cancer Diagnosis (LAPCD) study.', 'Life after prostate cancer: A systematic literature review and thematic synthesis of the post-treatment experiences of Black African and Black Caribbean men.', 'Perceptions of prostate cancer in Black African and Black Caribbean men: a systematic review of the literature.', 'A meta-ethnography investigating relational influences on mental health and cancer-related health care interventions for racially minoritised people in the UK.', 'How chronic conditions are understood, experienced and managed within African communities in Europe, North America and Australia: A synthesis of qualitative studies.']"""

Activator of G-protein signaling 3 (AGS3/G-protein signaling modulator 1) was shown to be overexpressed in prostate adenocarcinoma relative to the prostate gland. In this study, we investigated the correlation between AGS3 overexpression and PCa malignancy. Immunoblotting analysis and real-time quantitative-PCR showed increase in AGS3 expression in the metastatic cell lines LNCaP (~3-fold), MDA PCa 2b (~2-fold), DU 145 (~2-fold) and TRAMP-C1 (~20-fold) but not in PC3 (~1-fold), relative to control RWPE-1. Overexpression of AGS3 in PC3, LNCaP and MDA PCa 2b enhanced tumor growth. AGS3 contains seven tetratricopeptide repeats (TPR) and four G-protein regulatory (GPR) motifs. Overexpression of the TPR or the GPR motifs in PC3 cells had no effect in tumor growth. Depletion of AGS3 in the TRAMP-C1 cells (TRAMP-C1-AGS3-/-) decreased cell proliferation and delayed wound healing and tumor growth in both C57BL/6 (~3-fold) and nude mice xenografts, relative to control TRAMP-C1 cells. TRAMP-C1-AGS3-/- tumors also exhibited a marked increase (~5-fold) in both extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2 and P38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activation, which correlated with a significant increase (~3-fold) in androgen receptor (AR) expression, relative to TRAMP-C1 xenografts. Interestingly, overexpression of AGS3 in TRAMP-C1-AGS3-/- cells inhibited ERK activation and AR overexpression as compared with control TRAMP-C1 cells. Taken together, the data indicate that the effect of AGS3 in prostate cancer development and progression is probably mediated via a MAPK/AR-dependent pathway.""","""['Timothy O Adekoya', 'Nikia Smith', 'Temilade Aladeniyi', 'Joe B Blumer', 'Xiaoxin L Chen', 'Ricardo M Richardson']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Carcinogenesis""","""['Host versus cell-dependent effects of β-arrestin 1 expression in prostate tumorigenesis.', 'Nintedanib antiangiogenic inhibitor effectiveness in delaying adenocarcinoma progression in Transgenic Adenocarcinoma of the Mouse Prostate (TRAMP).', 'Dissociation between androgen responsiveness for malignant growth vs. expression of prostate specific differentiation markers PSA, hK2, and PSMA in human prostate cancer models.', 'P21 and P27 promote tumorigenesis and progression via cell cycle acceleration in seminal vesicles of TRAMP mice.', 'Activators of G-protein signaling 3: a drug addiction molecular gateway.', 'Deciphering a cell death-associated signature for predicting prognosis and response to immunotherapy in lung squamous cell carcinoma.', 'Identifying GPSM Family Members as Potential Biomarkers in Breast Cancer: A Comprehensive Bioinformatics Analysis.', 'Knockdown of GPSM1 Inhibits the Proliferation and Promotes the Apoptosis of B-Cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Cells by Suppressing the ADCY6-RAPGEF3-JNK Signaling Pathway.', 'Host versus cell-dependent effects of β-arrestin 1 expression in prostate tumorigenesis.', 'Intersection of two key signal integrators in the cell: activator of G-protein signaling 3 and dishevelled-2.']"""

The aims of this investigation were to describe three novel methods used to measure the displacement of i) the vesico-urethral junction (VUJ), proximal membranous urethra (PMU) and anorectal junction (ARJ) and ii) the VUJ angle of displacement in men following radical prostatectomy and determine their intra- and interrater reliability.  Methods:   Retrospective comparative measurement of twenty pre- and postoperative MRI scans was undertaken by one observer on two separate occasions and on one occasion by another observer. Three standardized midsagittal pelvimetry reference lines were used to describe three X, Y axis measurement systems. The displacement (mm) of the VUJ, PMU and ARJ, and the angle of displacement (degrees) of the VUJ was measured for each of the three methods. Interrater reliability of VUJ, PMU and ARJ displacement and the VUJ angle of displacement measurements was assessed using a two-way mixed-effects agreement intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Test-retest (intrarater) reliability was calculated using a two-way random effects consistency ICC with 95% CI for all displacement measures of the VUJ, PMU and ARJ for one observer between two days.  Results:   The pubococcygeal line (PCL) axis measurement system demonstrated good to excellent intrarater and interrater reliability (ICC 95% interval lower bound > 0.75) for the VUJ and PMU displacement and the VUJ angle of displacement measurements. Other measurement systems were less reliable and more variable.  Conclusions:   In this sample of 20 Korean patients with median prostate volume 27.5 mL and maximum volume 70 mL, the measurement methodology using the PCL consistently demonstrated good to excellent reliability and the lowest variability for the measurement of the displacement of the VUJ and PMU and the VUJ angle of displacement. The PCL methodology is recommended as the method of choice.

However, pelvic CT leads to additional imaging dose and requires significant resources to acquire and process both CT and MRI. In this study, we propose an automatic postimplant dosimetry approach that retains MRI for soft-tissue contouring, but eliminates the need for CT and reduces imaging dose while overcoming the inconsistent appearance of seeds on MRI with three projection x rays acquired using a mobile C-arm.  Methods:   Implanted seeds are reconstructed using x rays by solving a combinatorial optimization problem and deformably registered to MRI. Candidate seeds are located in MR images using local hypointensity identification. X ray-based seeds are registered to these candidate seeds in three steps: (a) rigid registration using a stochastic evolutionary optimizer, (b) affine registration using an iterative closest point optimizer, and (c) deformable registration using a local feature point search and nonrigid coherent point drift. The algorithm was evaluated using 20 PPB patients with x rays acquired immediately postimplant and T2-weighted MR images acquired the next day at 1.5 T with mean 0.8 × 0.8 × 3.0 mm 3 voxel dimensions. Target registration error (TRE) was computed based on the distance from algorithm results to manually identified seed locations using coregistered CT acquired the same day as the MRI. Dosimetric accuracy was determined by comparing prostate D90 determined using the algorithm and the ground truth CT-based seed locations.  Results:   The mean ± standard deviation TREs across 20 patients including 1774 seeds were 2.23 ± 0.52 mm (rigid), 1.99 ± 0.49 mm (rigid + affine), and 1.76 ± 0.43 mm (rigid + affine + deformable). The corresponding mean ± standard deviation D90 errors were 5.8 ± 4.8%, 3.4 ± 3.4%, and 2.3 ± 1.9%, respectively. The mean computation time of the registration algorithm was 6.1 s.

The secondary purpose was to determine the impact of volumetric parameter responses to overall survival.  Methods:   PSMA tumor volumes (PSMA-TV) and tumor lesion PSMA expressions (TL-PSMA) were calculated with a semi-automatic program on Ga-68 PSMA I&T PET/CT images that were obtained before and after Lu-177 PSMA I&T therapies with 19 patients. The median overall survival was compared with PSMA-TV, TL-PSMA, SUVmax, PSA, and alteration in PERCIST criteria.  Results:   PSMA-TV values were decreased in 12 patients (63%), and TL-PSMA values were decreased in 15 patients (79%) following the therapy. The SUVmax and the PSA values were also decreased in 14 (74%) and 10 (53%) patients, respectively. The complete remission (CR) was observed in two patients (10%). The partial response (PR) and progressive disease were observed in 6 (32%) and 11 (58%) patients, respectively, according to PRECIST criteria. The survival rates were statistically significant in patients with a decrease in PSMA-TV and TL-PSMA values than patients without any decrease (p 0.001, p < 0.001, respectively).

Methods:   We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 3,579 men treated for localized (stage 1-2) prostate cancer with radical prostatectomy at a single institution between 1994 and 2004. Marital status (not married vs. married) and marital history (never married, divorced, widowed vs. married) at the time of prostatectomy were examined in relation to (1) all-cause mortality and (2) prostate cancer-specific mortality using Cox proportional hazards regression.  Results:   Not being married (vs. married) at the time of radical prostatectomy was associated with an increased risk of all-cause mortality [Hazard Ratio (HR) 1.42; 95% Confidence Interval (CI) 1.10, 1.85]. Similarly, in analyses of marital history, never-married men were at highest risk of all-cause mortality (HR 1.77, 95% CI 1.19, 2.63). Unmarried status (vs. married) was also associated with an increased risk of prostate cancer-specific mortality (HR 1.97; 95% CI 1.01, 3.83).  Conclusions:   Unmarried men with prostate cancer were at greater risk for death after radical prostatectomy. Among married men with prostate cancer, marriage likely serves as a multi-faceted proxy for many protective factors including social support. Future studies should explore the mechanisms underlying these findings to inform the development of novel prostate cancer survival interventions for unmarried men and those with low social support.""","""['Saira Khan#', 'Kenneth G Nepple#', 'Adam S Kibel', 'Gurdarshan Sandhu', 'Dorina Kallogjeri', 'Seth Strope', 'Robert Grubb rd', 'Kathleen Y Wolin', 'Siobhan Sutcliffe']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Cancer Causes Control""","""['The effect of marital status on stage and survival of prostate cancer patients treated with radical prostatectomy: a population-based study.', 'Assessment of Modifiable Factors for the Association of Marital Status With Cancer-Specific Survival.', 'Marital status and prostate cancer outcomes.', 'Marital status and survival in cancer patients: A systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'The protective effect of marriage for survival: a review and update.', 'Marital status is an independent prognostic factor for cervical adenocarcinoma: A population-based study.', 'Marital status and perceived stress in men with advanced prostate cancer: A randomized-controlled trial of cognitive behavioral stress management.', ""Undergoing radical treatment for prostate cancer and its impact on wellbeing: A qualitative study exploring men's experiences."", 'Marital status as an independent prognostic factor for patients of malignant pleural mesothelioma.', 'A model established using marital status and other factors from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database for early stage gastric cancer.']"""

To overcome this limitation, we investigated the demographic and clinical characteristics of patients with pathogenic variants.  Methods:   We sequenced eight genes associated with hereditary PCa in 7636 unselected Japanese patients with PCa and 12 366 male, cancer-free control individuals. We assigned clinical significance for all 1456 variants using the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics guidelines and ClinVar. We compared the frequency of carriers bearing pathogenic variants between cases and control participants with calculated PCa risk in each gene and documented the demographic and clinical characteristics of patients bearing pathogenic variants. All statistical tests were two-sided.  Results:   We identified 136 pathogenic variants, and 2.9% of patients and 0.8% of control individuals had a pathogenic variant. Association with PCa risk was statistically significant for variants in BRCA2 (P < .001, odds ratio [OR] = 5.65, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 3.55 to 9.32), HOXB13 (P < .001, OR = 4.73, 95% CI = 2.84 to 8.19), and ATM (P < .001, OR = 2.86, 95% CI = 1.63 to 5.15). We detected recurrent new pathogenic variants such as p.Gly132Glu of HOXB13. Patients with pathogenic variants were 2.0 years younger at diagnosis and more often had smoking and alcohol drinking histories as well as family histories of breast, pancreatic, lung, and liver cancers.

In the current study, Raman mapping of the whole cell area was undertaken to ensure a more comprehensive understanding of the changes induced by X-ray radiation. On the basis of the collected Raman spectral maps, PLSR models were constructed to elucidate the time-dependent evolution of chemical changes induced in cells by irradiation, and the performance of PLSR models based on whole cell averages as compared to those based on average Raman spectra of cytoplasm and nuclear region. On the other hand, prediction of X-ray doses for individual cellular components showed that cytoplasmic and nuclear regions should be analysed separately.

The first was a polymorphism (rs2294008) in prostate stem cell antigen (PSCA), and the other was a polymorphism (rs4072037) in mucin 1 (MUC1). DNA methylation is associated with gastric cancer and Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori)-induced gastritis, while hypermethylation of promoter CpG island (CGI) is a common characteristic of enlarged-fold gastritis induced by H. pylori, a risk factor of diffuse-type gastric cancer. We evaluated the association between PSCA and MUC1 polymorphisms with H. pylori--related promoter CGI methylation in the nonneoplastic gastric mucosa. PSCA rs2294008 C/T and MUC1 rs4072037 A/G polymorphisms were genotyped in 410 cancer-free subjects in relation to promoter CGI methylation status of three candidate genes, of which the methylation status is associated with H. pylori infection (IGF2, MYOD1, and SLC16A12). Methylation levels of all three genes were significantly higher in subjects with PSCA rs2294008 T/T compared with the PSCA rs2294008 C/C (all P < 0.05). Such associations were more enhanced in H. pylori-positive subjects (all P < 0.01). The multivariate analysis demonstrated that PSCA C/T [OR, 2.37; 95% CI (confidence interval), 1.06-5.29; P = 0.035] and T/T genotypes (OR, 3.2; 95% CI, 1.41-7.25; P = 0.005) were significantly associated with methylation-high gastric mucosa as independent factors. MUC1 rs4072037 A/G polymorphism was not associated with methylation status of all three genes.

NKX3.1 is a growth suppressor, mediator of apoptosis, inducer of antioxidants, and enhancer of DNA repair. PTEN is a ubiquitous tumor suppressor that is often decreased in prostate cancer during tumor progression. Steady-state turnover of NKX3.1 is mediated by DYRK1B phosphorylation at NKX3.1 serine 185 that leads to polyubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. In this study, we show PTEN is an NKX3.1 phosphatase that protects NKX3.1 from degradation. PTEN specifically opposed phosphorylation at NKX3.1(S185) and prolonged NKX3.1 half-life. PTEN and NKX3.1 interacted primarily in the nucleus as loss of PTEN nuclear localization abrogated its ability to bind to and protect NKX3.1 from degradation. The effect of PTEN on NKX3.1 was mediated via rapid enzyme-substrate interaction. An effect of PTEN on Nkx3.1 gene transcription was seen in vitro, but not in vivo. In gene-targeted mice, Nkx3.1 expression significantly diminished shortly after loss of Pten expression in the prostate. Nkx3.1 loss primarily increased prostate epithelial cell proliferation in vivo. In these mice, Nkx3.1 mRNA was not affected by Pten expression. Thus, the prostate cancer suppressors PTEN and NKX3.1 interact and loss of PTEN is responsible, at least in part, for progressive loss of NKX3.1 that occurs during tumor progression.

Men with complete information about family history of prostate cancer in an FDR were included. The effect of family history on prostate cancer incidence and mortality was assessed in a multivariate Cox regression model. Likewise, the effect of the number of FDRs with prostate cancer and the effect of youngest diagnosis age of an FDR with prostate cancer were assessed.  Results:   A total of 74,781 participants were included in the current analysis, including 5281 participants with family history of prostate cancer in an FDR and 69,500 participants without family history of prostate cancer in an FDR. Among participants without family history of prostate cancer in an FDR, a total of 7450 patients (10.5%) were subsequently diagnosed with prostate cancer; whereas among patients with family history of prostate cancer in an FDR, a total of 889 patients (16.5%) were subsequently diagnosed with prostate cancer. In an adjusted multivariate Cox regression model, family history of prostate cancer was associated with a higher probability of prostate cancer diagnosis (hazard ratio [HR], 1.590; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.482-1.705; P < .001).

Patients and methods:   The records of 108 patients treated with salvage prostate cryoablation for biopsy-proven local recurrence after primary cryotherapy were retrospectively reviewed. Oncological outcome was defined by the rate of biochemical recurrence (BCR) after salvage ablation using Phoenix criteria.  Results:   Whole-gland (n = 91; 84.3%) or focal (n = 17; 15.7%) salvage cryoablation after failed primary cryosurgery were used.

Two-year and 5-year BCR rates after salvage therapy were 28.2% and 48.3%, respectively. In univariate analysis, a higher Gleason score, D'Amico risk category (P < .0001) as well as prostate-specific antigen density >0.15 ng/mL/cc (P = .02) before second cryotherapy were significantly associated with the risk of BCR. In multivariable analysis, the only significant factor associated with risk of BCR after the second ablation was a higher presalvage D'Amico risk category (P = .008).

However, its role in prostate cancer (PCa) is largely unknown. In this study, we described the PBRM1 transcriptional levels and the protein expression/localization in tissues of PCa patients and in prostatic cell lines. Increased PBRM1 mRNA levels were found in PCa samples, when compared to benign disease, and were correlated with higher Gleason score. We also verified that only the nuclear localization of PBRM1 protein is correlated with a more aggressive disease and high Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA) levels in tissue microarrays. Intriguing expression patterns of mRNA and protein were identified in the cell lines.

DNA methylation alterations are not restricted to the immediate peritumor environment, but spatially widespread in the adjacent and distant histologically normal prostate tissues. In the current study, we utilized high-throughput methylation arrays to identify epigenetic changes in the urine from men with and without cancer.  Design, setting, and participants:   DNA urine samples were enriched for methylated fragments using MBD methyl-binding antibodies and applied to high density CytoScanHD arrays. Significant loci were validated using quantitative pyrosequencing and binary logistic regression modeling applied to urine sample analyses in a training (n = 83) and validation approach (n = 84). Methylation alterations in prostate tissues using pyrosequencing at the PLA2G16 locus were examined in 38 histologically normal specimens from men with (TA, n = 26) and without (NTA, n = 12) cancer and correlated to gene expression.  Results:   Methylation microarrays identified 3,986 loci showing significantly altered methylation in the urine samples from patients with PC compared to those without (TA vs NTA; p<0.01). These loci were then compared against subjects with their prostates removed to exclude non-prostate cell markers yielding 196 significant regions. Multiple CpGs adjacent to PLA2G16 CpG island showed increased methylation in TA compared to NTA (p<0.01) in a large validation study of urine samples. The predictive accuracy of PLA2G16 methylation at CG2 showed the highest predictive value at 0.8 (odds ratio, 1.37; 95% confidence interval, 1.16-1.62; p<0.001). Using a probability cutoff of 0.065, the sensitivity and specificity of the multivariate model was 92% and 35%. When histologically normal prostate tissues/biopsies from patients with PC (TA) were compared to subjects without cancer, significant hypermethylation of PLA2G16 was noted (odds ratio, 1.35; 95% confidence interval, 1.07-1.71; p = 0.01).  Conclusion:   PLA2G16 methylation defines an extensive field defect in histologically normal prostate tissue associated with PC.

We sought to define regions at risk for residual disease as well as the accuracy of prostate specific membrane antigen ligand positron emission tomography in patients with prostate specific antigen persistence.  Materials and methods:   At 6 participating centers a total of 191 patients who underwent 68Ga-prostate specific membrane antigen-11 positron emission tomography/computerized tomography or positron emission tomography/magnetic resonance imaging for persistently elevated postoperative prostate specific antigen (0.1 ng/ml or greater) were retrospectively included in study. The detection rate and the positive predictive value were determined. In 33 patients with additional prostate specific membrane antigen ligand positron emission tomography before prostatectomy we also determined the rate of positron emission tomography based persistence and recurrence.  Results:   Prostate specific membrane antigen ligand positron emission tomography localized prostate cancer in 130 of 191 patients (68%) with prostate specific antigen persistence at a median prostate specific antigen of 1.1 ng/ml. The detection rate significantly increased with prostate specific antigen (p <0.001). Regarding prostate specific membrane antigen positron emission tomography/computerized tomography only 61 of 173 patients (35%) had disease confined to the pelvis while 57 of 173 (33%) had distant lesions. The most frequently affected nodal regions were the obturator in 42% and the presacral/mesorectal region in 40%. In 15 of the 33 patients (45%) with prostate specific membrane antigen ligand positron emission tomography before and after surgery at least 1 lesion was detected at baseline (positron emission tomography persistence), 8 (24%) had new lesions (positron emission tomography recurrence) and 10 (30%) had negative positron emission tomography findings. The positive predictive value of prostate specific membrane antigen ligand positron emission tomography was 91%. Systemic therapy initiation was significantly associated with distant lesions on prostate specific membrane antigen ligand positron emission tomography.

However, low PSMA surface expression in certain patients is a limitation for PSMA-based technologies. We have previously shown that high doses of dutasteride, a 5α-reductase inhibitor generally used for the treatment of benign prostatic enlargement, increase the PSMA expression in vitro. We now further analyzed the concentration- and time-dependent effects of dutasteride in LNCaP cells.  Methods:   Androgen receptor (AR) expressing prostate cancer cells (LNCaP) were treated for 7 to 14 days with vehicle control (0.1% dimethyl sulfoxide) or different concentrations of dutasteride (0.25 , 0.5 , 1 , and 5 μM). In addition to cell proliferation, PSMA surface expression was assessed using flow cytometry (FACS) and immunocytochemistry. Total PSMA and AR expression was analyzed by capillary western immunoassay (WES). In addition, tumor cell uptake and internalization assays of 177 Lu-PSMA-617 were performed.  Results:   Dutasteride treatment resulted in a significant upregulation of PSMA surface expression compared to vehicle control after 7 days in all tested concentrations. After 14 days a further, concentration-dependent increase of PSMA surface expression was detectable. Total PSMA protein expression significantly increased after treatment of cells with high concentrations of dutasteride using 5 μM for 7 or 14 days. However, when lower concentrations were used total PSMA expression was not significantly altered compared to vehicle control. Further testing revealed a dose-dependent increase in uptake and internalization of 177Lu -PSMA-617 after 7 and 14 days. Though, a significantly increased uptake was only observed using a 5 μM dutasteride concentration for 7 days as well as 1 and 5 μM for 14 days.  Conclusion:   Our investigations revealed a concentration- and time-dependent effect of dutasteride on PSMA expression and uptake of 177Lu -PSMA-617 in LNCaP cells. A short-term treatment of patients with high doses of dutasteride might increase the detection rate of PSMA-based imaging and increase the effect of 177Lu -PSMA-617 therapy via upregulation of PSMA expression.""","""['Benedikt Kranzbühler', 'Souzan Salemi', 'Christoph A Umbricht', 'Luisa M Deberle', 'Cristina Müller', 'Irene A Burger', 'Thomas Hermanns', 'Tullio Sulser', 'Daniel Eberli']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Impact of short-term Dutasteride treatment on prostate-specific membrane antigen expression in a mouse xenograft model.', 'Pharmacological upregulation of prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) expression in prostate cancer cells.', '68Ga- and 177Lu-Labeled PSMA I&T: Optimization of a PSMA-Targeted Theranostic Concept and First Proof-of-Concept Human Studies.', 'Prostate-specific membrane antigen theranostics: therapy with lutetium-177.', 'Lutetium 177 PSMA radionuclide therapy for men with prostate cancer: a review of the current literature and discussion of practical aspects of therapy.', 'Pharmacological Optimization of PSMA-Based Radioligand Therapy.', 'Impact of short-term Dutasteride treatment on prostate-specific membrane antigen expression in a mouse xenograft model.', 'Antihormone treatment differentially regulates PSA secretion, PSMA expression and 68Ga-PSMA uptake in LNCaP cells.']"""

To date, no studies have validated the Patient-Reported Outcome Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Sexual Interest and Satisfaction single item measures in patients with prostate cancer, nor have studies examined how these measures relate to erectile function. In addition, data are lacking with regard to the clinical responsiveness of these measures to treatment. We sought to validate and examine the clinical utility of these measures in men after radical prostatectomy.  Patients and methods:   We identified men who underwent a robotic radical prostatectomy from May 2014 to January 2016 in the Michigan Urological Surgery Improvement Collaborative. A single item from the PROMIS Global Satisfaction With Sex Life subdomain and a single item from the PROMIS Interest in Sexual Activity subdomain were administered. Erectile function was also assessed. Differences between baseline and 24-month T-scores for both PROMIS interest and satisfaction were examined. Multilevel models were constructed to examine change over time.  Results:   A total of 1,604 patients were included in the analysis. Convergent and discriminant validity of the PROMIS measures was supported. The mean PROMIS interest T-score decreased significantly from baseline to 3 months (P = .001) and significantly increased from 3 months to 24 months in this cohort, with 24-month scores exceeding baseline scores (P < .001). The mean PROMIS satisfaction T-score declined from baseline to 3 months and increased from 3 months to 24 months (P < .002).  Conclusion:   PROMIS Global Satisfaction With Sex Life and Interest in Sexual Activity single-item measures are fundamental measures in prostate cancer survivorship. Patients are interested in sex despite functional losses and can salvage satisfaction, thereby giving insight into attainable patient-centered survivorship goals for sexual recovery after radical prostatectomy.""","""['Nnenaya Q Agochukwu', 'Daniela Wittmann', 'Nicholas R Boileau', 'Rodney L Dunn', 'James E Montie', 'Tae Kim', 'David C Miller', 'James Peabody', 'Noelle E Carlozzi;Michigan Urological Surgery Improvement Collaborative']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""J Clin Oncol""","""['Validation of Patient-Reported Outcomes: A Low Bar.', 'Psychometric Evaluation of PROMIS Sexual Function and Satisfaction Measures in a Longitudinal Population-Based Cohort of Men With Localized Prostate Cancer.', 'Quality of Life, Psychological Functioning, and Treatment Satisfaction of Men Who Have Undergone Penile Prosthesis Surgery Following Robot-Assisted Radical Prostatectomy.', 'Patient- and Surgeon-Level Variation in Patient-Reported Sexual Function Outcomes Following Radical Prostatectomy Over 2 Years: Results From a Statewide Surgical Improvement Collaborative.', 'Predictors of Patient and Partner Satisfaction Following Radical Prostatectomy.', 'Perioperative Educational Interventions and Contemporary Sexual Function Outcomes of Radical Prostatectomy.', 'Patient-reported outcomes for people with diabetes: what and how to measure?

Objective:   To evaluate whether sarcopenia predicts survival in patients with lung, breast, prostate, or multiple myeloma spinal metastases.  Methods:   Psoas muscle measurements in patients with spinal metastasis were taken from computed tomography scans at 2 time points: at first episode of stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) and from the most recent scan available. Overall survival and hazard ratios were calculated with multivariate cox proportional hazards regression analyses.  Results:   In 417 patients with spinal metastases, 40% had lung cancer, 27% breast, 21% prostate, and 11% myeloma. Overall survival was not associated with age, sex, ethnicity, levels treated, or SBRT volume. Multivariate analysis showed patients in the lowest psoas tertile had shorter survival (222 d, 95% CI = 185-323 d) as compared to the largest tertile (579 d, 95% CI = 405-815 d), (HR1.54, P = .005). Median psoas size as a cutoff value was also strongly predictive for survival (HR1.48, P = .002). Survival was independent of tumor histology. The psoas/vertebral body ratio was also successful in predicting overall survival independent of tumor histology and gender (HR1.52, P < .01). Kaplan-Meier survival curves visually represent survival (P = .0005).  Conclusion:   In patients with spine metastases, psoas muscle size as a hallmark of frailty/sarcopenia is an objective, simple, and effective way to identify patients who are at risk for shorter survival, regardless of tumor histology. This information can be used to help with surgical decision making in patients with advanced cancer, as patients with small psoas sizes are at higher risk of death.""","""['Hesham Mostafa Zakaria', 'Jeremy T Llaniguez', 'Edvin Telemi', 'Matthew Chuang', 'Mohamed Abouelleil', 'Brandon Wilkinson', 'Ankush Chandra', 'David Boyce-Fappiano', 'Erinma Elibe', 'Lonni Schultz', 'Farzan Siddiqui', 'Brent Griffith', 'Steven N Kalkanis', 'Ian Yu Lee', 'Victor Chang']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Neurosurgery""","""['Application of morphometrics as a predictor for survival in female patients with breast cancer spinal metastasis: a retrospective cohort study.', 'Application of morphometric analysis to patients with lung cancer metastasis to the spine: a clinical study.', 'Sarcopenia as a Prognostic Factor for 90-Day and Overall Mortality in Patients Undergoing Spine Surgery for Metastatic Tumors: A Multicenter Retrospective Cohort Study.', 'Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy for Spinal Metastases in the Postoperative Setting: A Secondary Analysis of Mature Phase 1-2 Trials.', 'Reirradiation spine stereotactic body radiation therapy for spinal metastases: systematic review.', 'Two Older Hematological Malignancy Patients for Whom Nutrition Rehabilitation Was Effective Against Global Leadership Initiative on Malnutrition-Defined Malnutrition and Sarcopenia.', 'Comparison of Frailty Criteria, Cognitive Function, Depressive and Insomnia Symptoms in Men with Localized and Advanced Prostate Cancer under Androgen Deprivation Therapy.', 'Analysis of Frailty Syndrome in Men with Metastatic Prostate Cancer: A Scoping Review.', 'Sarcopenia in Patients With Spinal Metastasis: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Retrospective Cohort Studies.', 'Prognostic Impact of Sarcopenia in Patients with Metastatic Hormone-Sensitive Prostate Cancer.']"""

Androgen receptor antagonists are the main therapeutic strategy of PCa, which can block the binding of androgen to androgen receptors. However, the long-term treatment of marketed anti-androgens in patients can inevitably cause drug resistance problem. The research of searching for new drugs with novel skeleton is always on the way. Recently, a series of 3-phenylpyrazole derivatives were reported to antagonize the function of AR, but their efficiencies are not good enough and need to be improved. In this work, comparative molecular field analysis and comparative molecular similarity indices analysis methods were employed to study the structure activity relationships of these derivatives. Two different methods were used to obtain the optimal molecular conformation alignments, one is based on atomic alignment and the other is based on molecular docking. The final result shows that both these two strategies can obtain satisfactory results and the atomic alignment performs a little better than docking. The models illustrate the key structural features highly related with the androgenic bioactivity and provide valuable suggestions for the design of new androgen receptor antagonists in future.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

Although we have previously found KMT2D serves as an oncogene that promotes tumor growth and metastasis in prostate cancer (PCa), the functions and mechanisms of KMT2D are complicated and most remain undefined. Here, the function of KMT2D regarding DNA damage in PCa and the underlying mechanisms of KMT2D in epigenetic regulation were explored in a series of studies. Knockdown of KMT2D sensitized cells to DNA damage through the disturbance of antioxidative gene expression and increased levels of intracellular reactive oxygen species, which led to cell apoptosis and senescence. The loss of KMT2D reduced the abundance of enhancer activity markers H3K4me1 and H3K27ac, which blocked the DNA binding of FOXO3, a critical mediator of the cellular response to oxidative stress, and suppressed antioxidative gene transcription. Moreover, KMT2D deletion in PCa cells also increased their sensitivity to genotoxic anticancer drugs and a PARP inhibitor, which suggested that lower levels of KMT2D may mediate the response of PCa to particular treatments. These findings further highlighted the important role of KMT2D in PCa progression and suggested that targeting KMT2D might be therapeutically beneficial for advanced PCa treatment.""","""['Shidong Lv', 'Haoran Wen', 'Xiongwei Shan', 'Jianhua Li', 'Yaobin Wu', 'Xinpei Yu', 'Wenhua Huang', 'Qiang Wei']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Epigenetics""","""['Correction.', 'Histone methyltransferase KMT2D sustains prostate carcinogenesis and metastasis via epigenetically activating LIFR and KLF4.', 'Histone methyltransferase KMT2D promotes prostate cancer progression through paracrine IL-6 signaling.', 'Small molecule inhibitors of the prostate cancer target KMT2D.', 'Histone H3 lysine 4 methyltransferase KMT2D.', 'Gene methylation in gastric cancer.', 'Lineage plasticity and treatment resistance in prostate cancer: the intersection of genetics, epigenetics, and evolution.', '""PRRX1-rearranged mesenchymal tumors"": expanding the immunohistochemical profile and molecular spectrum of a recently described entity with the proposed revision of nomenclature.', 'PLK-1 Interacting Checkpoint Helicase, PICH, Mediates Cellular Oxidative Stress Response.', 'Integrated analysis reveals FOXA1 and Ku70/Ku80 as targets of ivermectin in prostate cancer.', 'Comprehensive Pan-Cancer Analysis of Senescence With Cancer Prognosis and Immunotherapy.']"""

It is unclear whether this is due to systemic cholesterol-lowering or direct local growth inhibition in the prostate. It is also unclear whether statins can access the prostate; lipophilic statins could, in theory, pass lipid-enriched cell membranes by passive diffusion. However, statin concentrations in the human prostate have not been measured before.  Methods:   The study population was based on a randomized clinical trial where 158 men with prostate cancer were randomized to use 80 mg atorvastatin (ATV) or placebo daily for a median of 27 days before radical prostatectomy. ATV and atorvastatin lactone (ATV-Lactone) concentrations in the plasma and in the prostate were measured with mass spectrometry in men randomized to the ATV arm. Linear trends between intraprostatic concentration and plasma concentration, body mass index, age, and duration of intervention were examined. The relative tissue concentrations of ATV and ATV-Lactone were calculated in prostatic tissue and plasma to evaluate drug homeostasis. Subgroup analyses were stratified by tumor and population characteristics.  Results:   The analysis involved a total of 55 men. When limited to men whose tissue concentrations of ATV was measurable (n = 28, 50%), median ATV concentration was 212% higher in the tissue (median concentration 17.6 ng/g) compared to the plasma (median concentration 3.6 ng/mL). Also, ATV-L concentration was 590% higher in the tissue as compared to the plasma concentration. No statistically significant linear trends between the plasma and tissue concentrations were observed. When comparing the relative concentration of atorvastatin lactone over ATV, the concentrations were in balance in the plasma, In the prostate, however, the relative concentration of atorvastatin lactone was 57% lower compared to ATV (P = .009 for the difference between prostate tissue and plasma). No effect modification by tumor or population characteristics was observed.  Conclusions:   Measurable ATV concentrations in the prostate support ATV's ability to access the prostate from the circulation. ATV may accumulate in the prostate as intraprostatic concentrations are elevated compared to the plasma concentration.""","""['Emma Knuuttila', 'Jarno Riikonen', 'Heimo Syvälä', 'Seppo Auriola', 'Teemu J Murtola']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Atorvastatin Versus Placebo for Prostate Cancer Before Radical Prostatectomy-A Randomized, Double-blind, Placebo-controlled Clinical Trial.', 'Circulatory and prostatic tissue lipidomic profiles shifts after high-dose atorvastatin use in men with prostate cancer.', 'Simultaneous analysis of the total plasma concentration of atorvastatin and its five metabolites and the unbound plasma concentration of atorvastatin: Application in a clinical pharmacokinetic study of single oral dose.', 'Lipid Screening in Childhood and Adolescence for Detection of Familial Hypercholesterolemia: A Systematic Evidence Review for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force Internet.', 'Clinical pharmacokinetics of atorvastatin.', 'Computational pharmacogenomic screen identifies drugs that potentiate the anti-breast cancer activity of statins.', ""Role of Lipids and Lipid Metabolism in Prostate Cancer Progression and the Tumor's Immune Environment."", 'Effects of high rosuvastatin doses on hepatocyte mitochondria of hypercholesterolemic mice.', 'Statin as a Potential Chemotherapeutic Agent: Current Updates as a Monotherapy, Combination Therapy, and Treatment for Anti-Cancer Drug Resistance.', 'Statins and Prostate Cancer: Bias, Precision Medicine, or Population Health?']"""

In this study, we investigated the enrichment pattern of GWAS signals for breast and prostate cancer in genomic functional regions located in normal tissue and cancer cell lines. We quantified the overall enrichment of SNPs with breast and prostate cancer association p values < 1 × 10-8 across regulatory categories. We then obtained annotations for DNaseI hypersensitive sites (DHS), typical enhancers, and super enhancers across multiple tissue types, to assess if significant GWAS signals were selectively enriched in annotations found in disease-related tissue. Finally, we quantified the enrichment of breast and prostate cancer SNP heritability in regulatory regions, and compared the enrichment pattern of SNP heritability with GWAS signals. DHS, typical enhancers, and super enhancers identified in the breast cancer cell line MCF-7 were observed with the highest enrichment of genome-wide significant variants for breast cancer. For prostate cancer, GWAS signals were mostly enriched in DHS and typical enhancers identified in the prostate cancer cell line LNCaP. With progressively stringent GWAS p value thresholds, an increasing trend of enrichment was observed for both diseases in DHS, typical enhancers, and super enhancers located in disease-related tissue. Results from heritability enrichment analysis supported the selective enrichment pattern of functional genomic regions in disease-related cell lines for both breast and prostate cancer.

Alternatively, fluorine-18 (18F)-labelled PSMA tracers are available, such as 18F-DCFPyL, which offer enhanced image quality and therefore potentially increased detection of small metastases. In this study we evaluate the lesion detection efficacy of 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT in patients with BCR and determine the detection efficacy as a function of their PSA value.  Methods:   A total of 248 consecutive patients were evaluated and underwent scanning with 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT for BCR between November 2016 and 2018 in two hospitals in the Netherlands. Patients were examined after radical prostatectomy (52%), external-beam radiation therapy (42%) or brachytherapy (6%). Imaging was performed 120 min after injection of a median dose of 311 MBq 18F-DCFPyL.  Results:   In 214 out of 248 PET/CT scans (86.3%), at least one lesion suggestive of cancer recurrence was detected ('positive scan'). Scan positivity increased with higher PSA values: 17/29 scans (59%) with PSA values <0.5 ng/ml; 20/29 (69%) with PSA 0.5 to <1.0 ng/ml; 35/41 (85%) with PSA 1.0 to <2.0 ng/ml; 69/73 (95%) with PSA 2.0 to <5.0 ng/ml; and 73/76 (96%) with PSA ≥5.0 ng/ml. Interestingly, suspicious lesions outside the prostatic fossa were detected in 39-50% of patients with PSA <1.0 ng/ml after radical prostatectomy (i.e. candidates for salvage radiotherapy).  Conclusion: 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT offers early detection of lesions in patients with BCR, even at PSA levels <0.5 ng/ml.

We wanted to compare both types of radiotherapy after prostatectomy in terms of oncological and functional results.  Methods:   We included 173 patients treated at a single center between January 2005 and December 2008. All patients were treated with the same radiotherapy protocol (3D conformal radiotherapy accelerator 6 mV, 66 GY). AR was defined as radiotherapy initiated in a patient with a PSA level <0.2 ng/mL after prostatectomy otherwise it was defined as SR. No patients received neoadjuvant therapy prior to prostatectomy (whether hormone therapy or chemotherapy). Patients in the SR group had a PSA level ≥0.2 ng/mL during the treatment in accordance with the Phoenix criteria. The lymph nodes were irradiated if the patient had no lymph node dissection and if the risk of nodal involvement was >10%. Both groups were compared in terms of biological progression-free, metastasis-free, and overall survival (OS) using log-rank tests. Moreover, acute and late urinary and gastrointestinal toxicity were also compared.  Results:   One hundred and fifty-seven patients underwent an open retropubic prostatectomy whereas 16 underwent a laparoscopy (6 subperitoneal and 10 transperitoneal). Eighty-six patients had AR with a median time of 6.7 months after surgery and 87 had SR with a median time of 21.4 months after surgery. Median follow-up was 6.7 years. Metastasis-free survival (MFS) was better in the AR than in the SR group (p = 0.01, 6-year MFS 95 and 89%, respectively). OS was also better in the AR than in the SR group (p = 0.02, 6-year OS 100 vs. 95%, respectively). AR was associated with better survival with no biochemical recurrence (85 vs. 63%, p < 0.00001). There was no significant difference between groups for acute or late urinary or gastrointestinal toxicity.  Conclusion:   Our study suggests that patients treated by AR have better results in terms of OS, disease-specific survival, survival without metastatic recurrence, and survival without biochemical recurrence compared with SR.

Therefore, we conducted a nationwide population-based cohort study to assess the overall cancer risk and risk for specific cancers in patients with PD in Korea.  Methods:   Using data from the Korean National Health Insurance Database, we analysed 52,009 patients diagnosed with PD between 2010 and 2015 and 260,045 individuals without PD. Patients previously diagnosed with cancer were excluded. The age- and sex-matched cohorts were followed up until 2016 for cancer development. Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to evaluate the relationship between PD and cancer.  Results:   Patients with PD had a lower overall cancer risk (hazard ratio [HR], 0.78; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.74-0.82) after adjustment for multiple covariates during 2,022,852.6 person-years of follow-up.

We examined whether RITI can be induced in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) following proton radiotherapy.  Methods:   Pre- and post-radiotherapy plasma samples from 26 patients with nonmetastatic NSCLC who received radiotherapy between 2010 and 2012 were evaluated by western blotting for IgG and IgM bands to assess RITI response to tumor antigens from lung cancer cell lines. Statistical analysis was used to evaluate any correlation among IgG or IgM and clinical outcomes.  Results:   Twenty-one patients received proton therapy at 2 GyRBE/fraction (n = 17) or 6-12 Gy/fraction (n = 4); five received photon therapy at 2-2.5 GyRBE/fraction. Compared with the pretreatment baseline, new IgG or IgM binding was detected in 27% and 50% of patients, respectively. New IgG bands were detected in the 25-37 kD, 50-75 kD, and 75-100 kD ranges. New IgM bands were detected in the 20-25 kD, 25-37 kD, 37-50 kD, 50-75 kD, and 75-100 kD ranges. There was no difference in IgG and/or IgM RITI response in patients treated with photons versus protons, or in patients who received SBRT compared to standard fractionation (P > 0.05). There was no difference in overall survival, metastasis-free survival, or local control based on IgG and/or IgM RITI response (P > 0.05).

Despite improvements in outcomes from next generation androgen receptor (AR)-axis inhibitors, CRPC remains incurable. Therapeutic strategies to target AR antagonist resistance are urgently needed to improve outcomes for men with this lethal form of prostate cancer.  Methods:   Apoptosis and BCL2 family signaling were characterized in cell line models of CRPC. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and Western blot analysis were used to determine BCL2 expression levels. Drug sensitivity was determined by proliferation, survival and apoptosis analysis. Protein-protein interactions were evaluated by coimmunoprecipitation followed by Western blot detection.  Results:   In the present study, we identify antiapoptotic BCL2 protein signaling as a mechanism of resistance to AR antagonist enzalutamide. In CRPC cell line models, we found that BCL-xL and MCL-1 proteins block apoptosis through binding and sequestering proapoptotic proteins BIM and BAX, resulting in cell survival in response to enzalutamide. Treatment with BH3-mimetics targeting BCL-xL or MCL-1 disrupts these interactions and activates apoptosis, sensitizing CRPC cells to enzalutamide. Importantly, we demonstrate that PI3K/Akt signaling is activated in response to enzalutamide and mediates apoptosis evasion through inactivation of BAD, a BH3-only protein that activates proapoptotic signlaing through inhbition of BCL-xL. Inhibition of Akt activates BAD, resulting in increased apoptosis and sensitivity to enzalutamide, demonstrating an alternative therapeutic strategy to target drug resistance.  Conclusions:   These results demonstrate that CRPC cells employ multiple mechanisms to mediate apoptosis evasion through BCL2 signaling, suggesting this pathway is critical for survival. This study provides a strong preclinical rationale for developing therapeutic strategies to target antiapoptotic BCL2 signaling in combination with AR antagonists to improve treatment options for patients with advanced prostate cancer.""","""['Amanda B Pilling', 'Clara Hwang']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['IAP Antagonists Enhance Apoptotic Response to Enzalutamide in Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer Cells via Autocrine TNF-α Signaling.', 'Targeting CPT1B as a potential therapeutic strategy in castration-resistant and enzalutamide-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Combined AKT and MEK Pathway Blockade in Pre-Clinical Models of Enzalutamide-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Enzalutamide as a second generation antiandrogen for treatment of advanced prostate cancer.', 'Understanding the mechanisms of androgen deprivation resistance in prostate cancer at the molecular level.', 'Identification of key enzalutamide-resistance-related genes in castration-resistant prostate cancer and verification of RAD51 functions.', 'Alveolar cell fate selection and lifelong maintenance of AT2 cells by FGF signaling.', 'Integrated network pharmacology and experimental analysis unveil multi-targeted effect of 18α- glycyrrhetinic acid against non-small cell lung cancer.', 'Enzalutamide Induces Apoptotic Insults to Human Drug-Resistant and -Sensitive Glioblastoma Cells via an Intrinsic Bax-Mitochondrion-Cytochrome C Caspase Cascade Activation Pathway.', 'Novel AR/AR-V7 and Mnk1/2 Degrader, VNPP433-3β: Molecular Mechanisms of Action and Efficacy in AR-Overexpressing Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer In Vitro and In Vivo Models.']"""

The socioecological model posits that individual health status is produced by the interaction of individual biology and their surrounding physical, social, and cultural environment. Despite evidence of the need to consider such hierarchical influences, little is known about the impact of area-level factors on cancer-related outcomes, including illness intrusiveness. Data from 993 breast, colorectal, and prostate cancer survivors within the first year of completing treatment were analyzed. Individual-level data for the Illness Intrusiveness Ratings Scale were linked to census tract-level data to characterize neighborhood conditions. Logistic regression modeled the association between individual-level variables, neighborhood-level racial composition, and the interaction between individual and area-level race on illness intrusiveness. A significant number of survivors (232, 23.4%) reported relatively high illness intrusiveness (score >28). The model including the interaction between area- and individual-level race exhibited significantly improved model fit (p < .05). The final model showed that racial minorities living in areas with a higher percentage of racial minorities had higher odds of greater illness intrusion when compared to Whites living in areas with a low percentage of racial minorities (adjusted odds ratio: 1.65, confidence interval: 1.01, 2.68). Results suggest that area-level factors can have profound effects on survivors' processing of their past cancer experience.

Objective:   We assessed whether positron emission tomography/computed tomography with gallium-68-labeled prostate-specific membrane antigen (68Ga-PSMA PET/CT) can be used to predict relapse after vascular-targeted photodynamic therapy (VTP).  Design, setting, and participants:   A total of 1×106 LNCaP cells were grafted subcutaneously in the flanks of 6-8-wk-old SCID mice. Of 24 mice with measurable tumors 6 wk after tumor implantation, 20 were treated with VTP (150mW/cm2) to ablate the tumors. Blood prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels were assessed, and ⁶⁸Ga-PSMA PET/CT images were performed 1 d before VTP and 1 and 4 wk after.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Local tumor relapse was evaluated by histology, and tumors were analyzed by prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) and PSA immunohistochemistry. T tests and Kruskal-Wallis tests were used to determine significance.  Results and limitations:   Four weeks after VTP, 11 (65%) mice had complete responses and six (35%) had tumor relapses confirmed by histology (hematoxylin and eosin, and PSMA immunohistochemistry). All mice with local relapse had positive 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT findings 4 wk after VTP; all complete responders did not. One week after VTP, the relapse detection sensitivity of 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT was 75%, whereas the sensitivity of PSA was only 33%. Compared with controls, relapsed tumors had a three-fold reduction in the number of cells with strong PSA staining by immunohistochemistry (1.5% vs 4.5%; p=0.01).  Conclusions:   In a preclinical prostate cancer model, we show that 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT can identify and predict relapse earlier than blood PSA level.

A Meta-analysis""","""Background:   Results from large randomized controlled trials combining docetaxel, abiraterone, celecoxib, or bisphosphonates with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) in hormone-sensitive prostate cancer have emerged. However, in our knowledge, few data are available in patients older than 70 years. Therefore, we undertook a meta-analysis of all published phase III studies.  Materials and methods:   We performed a PubMed search using the keywords: ""hormone sensitive prostate cancer,"" ""phase III studies,"" ""docetaxel,"" ""abiraterone,"" ""celecoxib,"" and ""bisphosphonates."" We also screened American Society of Clinical Oncology and European Society for Medical Oncology proceedings. Combination therapies were compared with ADT alone. The efficacy outcomes were overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS). Hazard ratios (HRs) with their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were collected from the studies and pooled. A hazard ratio of less than 1.00 favored the combination group.  Results:   This meta-analysis included 8 studies: 3 assessed docetaxel (CHAARTED, STAMPEDE arm E and C), 2 others assessed abiraterone (LATITUDE and STAMPEDE arm G); 2 others assessed celecoxib (STAMPEDE arm D and F), and the last one assessed zoledronic acid alone (STAMPEDE arm B). Our meta-analysis included 2264 patients (86% with metastases). Concerning age, we chose a cutoff of 70 years, corresponding to the available data for each study. The performance index was 0 to 1 for about 90% of patients. Overall, in patients > 70 years old, the addition of docetaxel statistically improved PFS (HR, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.42-0.61) but not OS (HR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.69-1.07). The addition of abiraterone to ADT also statistically improved PFS (HR, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.37-0.64) but not OS (HR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.67-1.08), as well as the addition of celecoxib (HR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.53-0.85 and HR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.73-1.25, respectively). The addition of zoledronic acid did not improve PFS or OS (HR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.61-1.00 and HR, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.71-1.38, respectively).  Conclusions:   The addition of docetaxel, abiraterone, or celecoxib to ADT significantly increased PFS in older men with hormone-sensitive advanced prostate cancer.

Methods and materials:   During the years 1999-2008, 241 patients with PCa who underwent LDR-BT with I125 and were followed up in Kuopio University Hospital were included to this analysis. The incidence of late severe (Grade 3) urinary toxicity and the long-term efficacy results were analyzed.  Results:   All D'Amico risk groups were represented, as 58.9%, 35.3%, and 5.8% of the patients were classified as low-, intermediate-, and high-risk patients, respectively. With a median followup of 11.4 years after implantation, the incidence of severe urinary toxicity increased throughout the followup period. The risk of Grade 3 urinary toxicity was highest among patients with higher Gleason scores (p = 0.016) and higher initial urine residual volumes (p = 0.017) and the cumulative incidence of severe urinary toxicity was 10.0%.

Recent reports from studies comparing moderately hypofractionated and conventionally fractionated radiotherapy support the clinical use of moderate hypofractionation. To date, there are no published randomised studies on ultra-hypofractionated radiotherapy. Here, we report the outcomes of the Scandinavian HYPO-RT-PC phase 3 trial with the aim to show non-inferiority of ultra-hypofractionation compared with conventional fractionation.  Methods:   In this open-label, randomised, phase 3 non-inferiority trial done in 12 centres in Sweden and Denmark, we recruited men up to 75 years of age with intermediate-to-high-risk prostate cancer and a WHO performance status between 0 and 2. Patients were randomly assigned to ultra-hypofractionation (42·7 Gy in seven fractions, 3 days per week for 2·5 weeks) or conventional fractionated radiotherapy (78·0 Gy in 39 fractions, 5 days per week for 8 weeks). No androgen deprivation therapy was allowed. The primary endpoint was time to biochemical or clinical failure, analysed in the per-protocol population. The prespecified non-inferiority margin was 4% at 5 years, corresponding to a critical hazard ratio (HR) limit of 1·338. Physician-recorded toxicity was measured according to the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) morbidity scale and patient-reported outcome measurements with the Prostate Cancer Symptom Scale (PCSS) questionnaire. This trial is registered with the ISRCTN registry, number ISRCTN45905321.  Findings:   Between July 1, 2005, and Nov 4, 2015, 1200 patients were randomly assigned to conventional fractionation (n=602) or ultra-hypofractionation (n=598), of whom 1180 (591 conventional fractionation and 589 ultra-hypofractionation) constituted the per-protocol population. 1054 (89%) participants were intermediate risk and 126 (11%) were high risk. Median follow-up time was 5·0 years (IQR 3·1-7·0). The estimated failure-free survival at 5 years was 84% (95% CI 80-87) in both treatment groups, with an adjusted HR of 1·002 (95% CI 0·758-1·325; log-rank p=0·99). There was weak evidence of an increased frequency of acute physician-reported RTOG grade 2 or worse urinary toxicity in the ultra-hypofractionation group at end of radiotherapy (158 [28%] of 569 patients vs 132 [23%] of 578 patients; p=0·057). There were no significant differences in grade 2 or worse urinary or bowel late toxicity between the two treatment groups at any point after radiotherapy, except for an increase in urinary toxicity in the ultra-hypofractionation group compared to the conventional fractionation group at 1-year follow-up (32 [6%] of 528 patients vs 13 [2%] of 529 patients; (p=0·0037). We observed no differences between groups in frequencies at 5 years of RTOG grade 2 or worse urinary toxicity (11 [5%] of 243 patients for the ultra-hypofractionation group vs 12 [5%] of 249 for the conventional fractionation group; p=1·00) and bowel toxicity (three [1%] of 244 patients vs nine [4%] of 249 patients; p=0·14). Patient-reported outcomes revealed significantly higher levels of acute urinary and bowel symptoms in the ultra-hypofractionation group compared with the conventional fractionation group but no significant increases in late symptoms were found, except for increased urinary symptoms at 1-year follow-up, consistent with the physician-evaluated toxicity.  Interpretation:   Ultra-hypofractionated radiotherapy is non-inferior to conventionally fractionated radiotherapy for intermediate-to-high risk prostate cancer regarding failure-free survival. Early side-effects are more pronounced with ultra-hypofractionation compared with conventional fractionation whereas late toxicity is similar in both treatment groups. The results support the use of ultra-hypofractionation for radiotherapy of prostate cancer.

Supraphysiological testosterone (SPT)-based therapy produces clinical responses with improved quality of life in a subset of patients. Currently, no information defines a durable response to SPT.  Objective:   To identify key molecular phenotypes underlying SPT response to improve patient selection and guide combination treatment to achieve a durable response.  Design, setting, and participants:   A patient-derived xenograft (PDX) preclinical trial was performed with 13 CRPC PDXs to identify molecular features associated with SPT response. Comprehensive intratumoral androgen, tumor growth, and integrated transcriptomic and protein analyses were performed in three PDXs resistant to the newer androgen receptor (AR) pathway inhibitor enzalutamide (ENZ) to define SPT response and resistance.  Intervention:   Testosterone cypionate.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   SPT efficacy was evaluated by PDX growth, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) change, and survival. Intratumoral androgens were analyzed using mass spectrometry. Global transcriptome analysis was performed using RNA sequencing, and confirmed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry. Log-rank and Mann-Whitney tests were used for survival and molecular analyses, respectively.  Results and limitations:   A durable SPT responder was identified, presenting robust repressions of ARv7 and E2F transcriptional outputs, and a DNA damage response (DDR) transcriptomic program that were altogether restored upon SPT resistance in the transient responder. ENZ rechallenge of SPT-relapsed PDXs resulted in PSA decreases but tumor progression.  Conclusions:   SPT produces a durable response in AR-pathway inhibitor ENZ CRPC that is associated with sustained suppression of ARv7 and E2F transcriptional outputs, and the DDR transcriptome, highlighting the potential of combination treatments that maintain suppression of these programs to drive a durable response to SPT.  Patient summary:   Patients with ENZ-resistant prostate cancer have very limited treatment options. Supraphysiological testosterone presents a prominent option for improved quality of life and a potential durable response in patients with sustained suppression on ARv7/E2F transcriptional outputs and DNA repair program.""","""['Hung-Ming Lam', 'Holly M Nguyen', 'Mark P Labrecque', 'Lisha G Brown', 'Ilsa M Coleman', 'Roman Gulati', 'Bryce Lakely', 'Daniel Sondheim', 'Payel Chatterjee', 'Brett T Marck', 'Alvin M Matsumoto', 'Elahe A Mostaghel', 'Michael T Schweizer', 'Peter S Nelson', 'Eva Corey']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Eur Urol""","""['Mechanisms of high-dose testosterone.', 'Supraphysiologic Testosterone Solutions for Enzalutamide-resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Serial bipolar androgen therapy (sBAT) using cyclic supraphysiologic testosterone (STP) to treat metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC).', 'Re: Hung-Ming Lam, Holly M.

This study investigated whether chronic inflammatory diseases (CID) or anti-inflammatory medication use (AIM) were associated with prostate cancer risk.  Methods:   Fifty-five thousand nine hundred thirty-seven cases (all prostate cancer, 2007-2012) and 279,618 age-matched controls were selected from the Prostate Cancer Database Sweden. CIDs and AIMs was determined from national patient and drug registers. Associations were investigated using conditional logistic regression, including for disease/drug subtypes and exposure length/dose.  Results:   Men with a history of any CID had slightly increased risk of any prostate cancer diagnosis (OR: 1.08; 95%CI: 1.04-1.12) but not 'unfavourable' (high-risk or advanced) prostate cancer. Generally, risk of prostate cancer was highest for shorter exposure times. However, a positive association was observed for asthma > 5 years before prostate cancer diagnosis (OR: 1.21; 95%CI: 1.05-1.40). Risk of prostate cancer was increased with prior use of any AIMs (OR: 1.26; 95%CI: 1.24-1.29). A positive trend with increasing cumulative dose was only observed for inhaled glucocorticoids (p < 0.011).  Conclusion:   Detection bias most likely explains the elevated risk of prostate cancer with prior history of CIDs or use of AIMs, given the higher risk immediately after first CID event and lack of dose response. However, findings for length of time with asthma and dose of inhaled glucocorticoids suggest that asthma may increase risk of prostate cancer through other pathways.""","""['Kerri Beckmann', 'Beth Russell', 'Debra Josephs', 'Hans Garmo', 'Christel Haggstrom', 'Lars Holmberg', 'Pär Stattin', 'Mieke Van Hemelrijck', 'Jan Adolfsson']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""BMC Cancer""","""['Low-dose aspirin or other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug use and prostate cancer risk: a nationwide study.', 'Vasectomy and prostate cancer: a case-control study in India.', 'Increased inflammatory potential of diet is associated with increased odds of prostate cancer in Argentinian men.', 'Special considerations in pediatric asthma.', 'Nongenomic effects of glucocorticoids, an important mechanism of inhaled glucocorticoids action in asthma.', 'Risk of prostate cancer in patients with inflammatory bowel disease: a nationwide cohort study in South Korea.', 'Effect of Lactobacillus fermentum ZS40 on the NF-κB signaling pathway in an azomethane-dextran sulfate sodium-induced colon cancer mouse model.', 'Myeloid-Derived Suppressor Cells as Key Players and Promising Therapy Targets in Prostate Cancer.', 'The Value of Real-World Data in Understanding Prostate Cancer Risk and Improving Clinical Care: Examples from Swedish Registries.', 'Exploring the Nutraceutical Potential of Dried Pepper Capsicum annuum L. on Market from Altino in Abruzzo Region.']"""

Results from a National Survey Using a Discrete Choice Experiment""","""Background. Older adults with limited life expectancy frequently receive cancer screening, although on average, harms outweigh benefits. We examined the influence of life expectancy on older adults' cancer screening decisions relative to three other factors. Methods. Adults aged 65+ years (N = 1272) were recruited from a national online survey panel. Using a discrete choice experiment, we systematically varied a hypothetical patient's life expectancy, age, quality of life, and physician's recommendation and asked whether the participant would choose screening. Participants were randomized to questions about colonoscopy or prostate-specific antigen/mammography screenings. Logistic regression produced preference weights that quantified the relative influence of the 4 factors on screening decisions. Results. 879 older adults completed the survey, 660 of whom varied their screening choices in response to the 4 factors we tested. The age of the hypothetical patient had the largest influence on choosing screening: the effect of age being 65 versus 85 years had a preference weight of 2.44 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.22, 2.65). Life expectancy (10 versus 1 year) had the second largest influence (preference weight: 1.64, CI: 1.41, 1.87). Physician recommendation (screen versus do not screen) and quality of life (good versus poor) were less influential, with preference weights of 0.90 (CI: 0.72, 1.08) and 0.68 (CI: 0.52, 0.83), respectively. Conclusions. While clinical practice guidelines increasingly use life expectancy in addition to age to guide screening decisions, we find that age is the most influential factor, independent of life expectancy, quality of life, and physician recommendation, in older adults' cancer screening choices. Strategies to reduce overscreening should consider the importance patients give to continuing screening at younger ages, even when life expectancy is limited.""","""['Ellen M Janssen', 'Craig E Pollack', 'Cynthia Boyd', 'John F P Bridges', 'Qian-Li Xue', 'Antonio C Wolff', 'Nancy L Schoenborn']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Med Decis Making""","""[""Patient-Reported Factors Associated With Older Adults' Cancer Screening Decision-making: A Systematic Review."", ""Older Adults' Views and Communication Preferences About Cancer Screening Cessation."", 'Different Types of Patient Health Information Associated With Physician Decision-making Regarding Cancer Screening Cessation for Older Adults.', 'Screening mammography in older women: a review.', ""A systematic review of factors influencing older adults' decision to accept or decline cancer treatment."", 'Physical Activity Preferences of People Living with Brain Injury: Formative Qualitative Research to Develop a Discrete Choice Experiment.', 'Association of Life Expectancy With Surveillance Colonoscopy Findings and Follow-up Recommendations in Older Adults.', 'Factors Associated With Declining Lung Cancer Screening After Discussion With a Physician in a Cohort of US Veterans.', 'Cost-Effectiveness of Screening Mammography Beyond Age 75 Years : A Cost-Effectiveness Analysis.', ""Patient-Reported Factors Associated With Older Adults' Cancer Screening Decision-making: A Systematic Review.""]"""

Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) are a critical step in the metastatic cascade and a good tool to study this process. We isolated CTCs from a syngeneic mouse model of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and a human xenograft mouse model of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). From these models, novel primary tumor and CTC cell lines were established. CTCs exhibited greater migration than primary tumor-derived cells, as well as epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), as observed from decreased E-cadherin and increased SLUG and fibronectin expression. Additionally, when fibronectin was knocked down in CTCs, integrin B1 and SLUG were decreased, indicating regulation of these molecules by fibronectin. Investigation of cell surface molecules and secreted cytokines conferring immunomodulatory advantage to CTCs revealed decreased major histocompatibility complex class I (MHCI) expression and decreased endostatin, C-X-C motif chemokine 5 (CXCL5), and proliferin secretion by CTCs. Taken together, these findings indicate that CTCs exhibit distinct characteristics from primary tumor-derived cells.

Objectives:   To compare the upgrading rates of International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) grades and tumor laterality in patients that underwent standard 12-core transrectal ultrasound-guided standard prostate biopsy (SPB) versus multiparametric magnetic resonance-guided fusion prostate biopsy (FPB) for PCa.  Methods:   This retrospective study included 152 patients that underwent prostate biopsy and RP in our clinic. The patients were divided into 2 groups: Group A (n = 90) included patients that underwent SPB and Group B (n = 62) included patients that underwent FPB (targeted biopsy + standard biopsy). Upgrading of ISUP grades, tumor laterality, and upgrading of tumor laterality were compared between the 2 groups. Upgrading of tumor laterality defined as detection of tumor at both lobes in RP pathology while it was at unilateral lobe in biopsy pathology.  Results:   ISUP grade 1 was the most common histopathology in both groups. The ISUP upgrading rate on final pathology was significantly lower in the FPB group compared to the SPB group (22.7 vs. 37.7%; p < 0.048). Similarly, the upgrading rate of tumor laterality was lower in the FPB group compared to the SPB group (37.7 vs. 9.7%; p < 0.001).

ENTPD5 supports cancer growth by promoting the import of UDP-glucose, a metabolite used for protein glycosylation and hence proper glycoprotein folding, into the ER by providing the counter molecule, UMP, to the ER antiporter. Despite its cancer-supporting function, no small molecule inhibitors of ENTPD5 are commercially available, and few studies have been performed in tissue culture to understand the effects of chemical inhibition of ENTPD5. We performed a high-throughput screen (HTS) of 21,120 compounds to identify small molecule inhibitors of ENPTD5 activity. Two hits were identified, and we performed a structure activity relationship (SAR) screen around these hits. Further validation of these probes were done in an orthogonal assay and then assayed in cell culture to assess their effect on prostate cancer cell lines. Notably, treatment with the novel ENTPD5 inhibitor reduced the amount of glycoprotein produced in treated cells, consistent with the hypothesis that ENTPD5 is important for glycoprotein folding. This work serves as an important step in designing new molecular probes for ENTPD5 as well as further probing the utility of targeting ENTPD5 to combat cancer cell proliferation.""","""['Matthew A Durst', 'Kiira Ratia', 'Arnon Lavie']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['ENTPD5-mediated modulation of ATP results in altered metabolism and decreased survival in gliomablastoma multiforme.', 'Mutant p53 promotes tumor progression and metastasis by the endoplasmic reticulum UDPase ENTPD5.', 'The ER UDPase ENTPD5 promotes protein N-glycosylation, the Warburg effect, and proliferation in the PTEN pathway.', 'New agents for prostate cancer.', 'Rapid identification and validation of novel targeted approaches for Glioblastoma: A combined ex vivo-in vivo pharmaco-omic model.', 'Knockdown of ENTPD5 inhibits tumor metastasis and growth via regulating the GRP78/p-eIF-2α/CHOP pathway in serous ovarian cancer.', 'ENTPD5: identification of splicing variants and their impact on cancer survival.', 'ENTPD5 gene is highly expressed in epithelial ovarian cancer: analysis based on Oncomine database and bioinformatics.', 'Whole-genome sequencing analysis of the cardiometabolic proteome.']"""

Here, we propose a rational design of a ternary nanoassembly (SAP) composed of nonionic amphiphilic β-cyclodextrins (amphiphilic CD) incorporating pheophorbide (Pheo) as a phototherapeutic and an adamantanyl-folic acid conjugate (Ada-FA) to target tumor cells overexpressing α-folate receptor (FR-α(+)). Dynamic light scattering and ζ-potential pointed out the presence of nanoassemblies bearing a negative surface charge (ζ = -51 mV). Morphology of SAP was investigated by atomic force microscopy and microphotoluminescence, indicating the presence of highly emissive near-spherical assemblies of about 280 nm in size. Complementary spectroscopic techniques such as ROESY-NMR, UV/vis and steady-state fluorescence revealed that the folic acid protrudes out of amphiphilic CD rims, prone for recognition with FR-α. Pheo was strongly loaded in the nanoassembly mostly in monomeric form, thus generating singlet oxygen (1O2) and consequentely showing phototherapeutic action. SAP remained stable until 2 weeks in aqueous solutions. Stability studies in biologically relevant media pointed out the ability of SAP to interact with serum proteins by means of the oligoethylenglycole fringe, without destabilization. Release experiments demonstrated the sustained release of Pheo from SAP in environments mimiking physiological conditions (∼20% within 1 week), plausibly suggesting low Pheo leaking and high integrity of the assembly within 24 h, time spent on average to reach the target sites. Cellular uptake of SAP was confirmed by confocal microscopy, pointing out that SAP was internalized into the tumoral cells expressing FR-α more efficiently than SP. SAP showed improved phototoxicity in human breast MCF-7 cancer cells FR-α(+) (IC50 = 270 nM) with respect to human prostate carcinoma PC3 cells (IC50 = 700 nM) that express a low level of that receptor (FR-α(-)). Finally, an improved phototoxicity in FR-α(+) MCF-7 cells (IC50 = 270 nM) was assessed after treatment with SAP vs SP (IC50 = 600 nM) which was designed without Ada-FA as a targeting unit.""","""['Roberto Zagami', 'Valentina Rapozzi', 'Anna Piperno', 'Angela Scala', 'Claudia Triolo', 'Mariachiara Trapani', 'Luigi E Xodo', 'Luigi Monsù Scolaro', 'Antonino Mazzaglia']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Biomacromolecules""","""['Gefitinib loaded folate decorated bovine serum albumin conjugated carboxymethyl-beta-cyclodextrin nanoparticles enhance drug delivery and attenuate autophagy in folate receptor-positive cancer cells.', 'Characterization and evaluation of a folic acid receptor-targeted cyclodextrin complex as an anticancer drug delivery system.', 'Folate-modified poly(2-ethyl-2-oxazoline) as hydrophilic corona in polymeric micelles for enhanced intracellular doxorubicin delivery.', 'Folate appended cyclodextrins for drug, DNA, and siRNA delivery.', 'Amphiphilic Cyclodextrin Derivatives for Targeted Drug Delivery to Tumors.', 'Amphiphilic Cyclodextrin Nanoparticles as Delivery System for Idebenone: A Preformulation Study.', 'Antimicrobial and Antibiofilm Photodynamic Action of Photosensitizing Nanoassemblies Based on Sulfobutylether-β-Cyclodextrin.', 'BioMOF-Based Anti-Cancer Drug Delivery Systems.', 'Cyclodextrin nanoparticles for diagnosis and potential cancer therapy: A systematic review.', 'Nanomedicine in Hepatocellular Carcinoma: A New Frontier in Targeted Cancer Treatment.']"""

In our study, we analyzed the relationship of OLFM4 expression with clinicopathological features and with CpG site methylation in the OLFM4 gene promoter region in human primary prostate adenocarcinoma. OLFM4 protein expression was significantly reduced in prostate cancer tissue compared to adjacent normal tissue and was further significantly reduced in more advanced cancers. Bioinformatic studies with clinical datasets revealed that primary prostate adenocarcinoma patients with reduced OLFM4 mRNA expression exhibited higher Gleason scores and higher preoperative serum prostate-specific antigen levels, as well as lower recurrence-free survival. Three of the eight CpG sites in the OLFM4 gene promoter region were hypermethylated in cancerous prostate cells compared to adjacent normal cells, and reduced methylation of eight CpG sites was associated with increased OLFM4 mRNA expression in RWPE1 and PC-3 cells. Furthermore, knockdown of OLFM4 gene expression was associated with enhanced epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-marker expression in RWPE immortalized normal prostate cells. In contrast, restoration of OLFM4 expression in PC-3 and DU145 prostate cancer cells lacking OLFM4 significantly inhibited both EMT-marker expression and tumor cell growth in in vitro and in vivo models, indicating that OLFM4 may play a tumor-suppressor role in inhibiting the EMT program, as well as tumor initiation and growth, in prostate cells. Taken together, these findings suggest that OLFM4 plays an important tumor-suppressor role in prostate cancer progression and might be useful as a novel candidate biomarker for prostate cancer.""","""['Hongzhen Li', 'Christine Kim', 'Wenli Liu', 'Jianqiong Zhu', 'Kay Chin', 'Jaime Rodriguez-Canales', 'Griffin P Rodgers']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Int J Cancer""","""['Deletion of the olfactomedin 4 gene is associated with progression of human prostate cancer.', 'Olfactomedin 4 deficiency promotes prostate neoplastic progression and is associated with upregulation of the hedgehog-signaling pathway.', 'Oestrogen receptor-mediated expression of Olfactomedin 4 regulates the progression of endometrial adenocarcinoma.', 'Olfactomedin 4, a\xa0novel marker for the differentiation and progression of gastrointestinal cancers.', 'Olfactomedin-4 in digestive diseases: A mini-review.', 'Characterization of olfactomedin 4+ cells in prostate and urethral-tube epithelium during murine postnatal development and in adult mice.', 'Characterisation of cell lines derived from prostate cancer patients with localised disease.', 'Genome-Wide Association Study Adjusted for Occupational and Environmental Factors for Bladder Cancer Susceptibility.', 'Olfactomedin 4 mediation of prostate stem/progenitor-like cell proliferation and differentiation via MYC.']"""

MRL treatment workflows (WF) include online plan adaptation based on daily MR images (MRI). This study reports initial clinical experiences after five months of use in terms of patient compliance, cases, WF timings, and dosimetric accuracy. Method and materials: Two different WF were used dependent on the clinical situation of the day; Adapt To Position WF (ATP) where the reference plan position is adjusted rigidly to match the position of the targets and the OARs, and Adapt To Shape WF (ATS), where a new plan is created to match the anatomy of the day, using deformable image registration. Both WFs included three 3D MRI scans for plan adaptation, verification before beam on, and validation during IMRT delivery. Patient compliance and WF timings were recorded. Accuracy in dose delivery was assessed using a cylindrical diode phantom. Results: Nineteen patients have completed their treatment receiving a total of 176 fractions. Cases vary from prostate treatments (60Gy/20F) to SBRT treatments of lymph nodes (45 Gy/3F) and castration by ovarian irradiation (15 Gy/3F). The median session time (patient in to patient out) for 127 ATPs was 26 (21-78) min, four fractions lasted more than 45 min due to additional plan adaptation. For the 49 ATSs a median time of 12 (1-24) min was used for contouring resulting in a total median session time of 42 (29-91) min. Three SBRT fractions lasted more than an hour. The time on the MRL couch was well tolerated by the patients. The median gamma pass rate (2 mm,2% global max) for the adapted plans was 99.2 (93.4-100)%, showing good agreement between planned and delivered dose.

Thus, the objective of this study was to determine whether the use of ADT is associated with an increased risk of RA in men with prostate cancer.  Patients and methods:   We conducted a population-based cohort study using the United Kingdom Clinical Practice Research Datalink. The cohort included all men, at least 40 years of age, newly diagnosed with prostate cancer between 1 January 1988 and 31 March 2014, with follow-up until 30 September 2014. Exposure to ADT was treated as a time-varying variable and lagged by 1 year to account for diagnostic delays and latency. Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of RA, comparing use of ADT with non-use. Secondary analyses were conducted to assess whether the association varied according to ADT type and cumulative duration of use. Finally, we conducted several sensitivity analyses to assess the robustness of our findings.  Results:   The cohort included 32,302 men followed for a median of 3.3 years. During follow-up, 63 patients were newly diagnosed with RA, generating an incidence rate of 46.5/100,000 person-years. Compared with non-use, the use of ADT was not associated with an increased risk of RA (HR 0.84, 95% CI 0.49-1.45). In secondary analyses, the association did not vary according to ADT type or with cumulative duration of use (p trend = 0.53). The results remained consistent in sensitivity analyses.

There are limited quality of life data evaluating the difference between androgen deprivation therapy and non-androgen deprivation therapy. Objective To evaluate the HRQoL among prostate cancer patients with androgen deprivation therapy and non-androgen deprivation therapy in an Asian population. Setting The study was conducted at the urology outpatient department in a medical center and a regional hospital in southern Taiwan. Methods We collected the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30 (EORTC QLQ-C30) and Quality of Life Questionnaire-Prostate (QLQ-PR25) among prostate cancer patients with and without androgen deprivation therapy from December 2017 to June 2018. The androgen deprivation therapy subjects in this study were using goserelin, leuprolide, degarelix, bicalutamide, enzalutamide, cyproterone, and abiraterone. The non-androgen deprivation therapy subjects were only receiving radiation therapy or radical prostatectomy. To investigate the determinants of HRQoL between androgen deprivation therapy and non-androgen deprivation therapy, multiple linear regression was used. Main outcomes measures The scores of EORTC QLQ-C30 and QLQ-PR25. Results In total, 182 subjects participated in the study of which 116 (63.74%) were in androgen deprivation therapy user group with a mean age (± SD, standard deviation) of 75.94 years (± 8.31), and 66 (36.26%) subjects were in non-androgen deprivation therapy user group with a mean age of 70.6 years (± 7.1). androgen deprivation therapy users' quality of life was significantly lower than non-androgen deprivation therapy users (72.1 ± 19.3 vs. 77.8 ± 16.6, p = 0.0493). Conclusions The quality of life of patients with all-stages prostate cancer differs significantly between androgen deprivation therapy users and non-androgen deprivation therapy users. The HRQoL for androgen deprivation therapy users is worse than for the non-androgen deprivation therapy users.

Methods:   We used electronic medical records for a cohort of men diagnosed with prostate cancer (PC) who attended a PC-related appointment at the Vancouver Prostate Centre, January 2013-December 2016. We used multivariate logistic regression to quantify the effect of diagnostic treatment and sociodemographic characteristic PCSC program registration and subsequent attendance. We produced Kaplan-Meier estimators to assess the probability of program attendance over the disease trajectory for those who registered.  Results:   Almost 15% of the men who registered for the program did not end up using any services. An additional 23% attended only one session/clinical appointment. Surgical and radiation treatments increased the odds and intensity of participation. Long travel distance decreased the odds of registering and participating. Low income decreased the odds of registration but not subsequent participation.  Conclusions:   While the use of supportive care services can help address the detrimental effects of prostate cancer diagnosis and treatment, one in six men who register for supportive care do not end up using any. Offering these services at no cost and alongside treatment appears to be insufficient to ensuring access for all patients.

Most patients diagnosed with advanced prostate cancer can be treated with the main treatment: androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). The androgen receptor (AR) signaling axis plays a pivotal role in the progression of prostate cancer. However, most patients can ultimately progress to the castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) stage within 2 years. At this stage, drugs targeting the AR signaling axis, including enzalutamide and abiraterone acetate, cannot prevent the progression of prostate cancer, thus predicting a poor prognosis. The molecular mechanism lies in the aberrant AR reactivation, which exhibits an adaptive response to ADT, such as the presence of AR splice variants. Thus, CRPC treatment remains a challenge. Purpose: In addition to the AR axis, a mechanism leading to this progression should be determined. The present study mainly compared palmitoylated proteins between androgen-treated LNCaP cells and non-treated LNCaP cells by palmitoylome profiling, to illustrate the changes at proteomic levels. Materials and methods: To screen the androgen-induced palmitoylated proteins, we conducted proteomic experiments using clickable palmitate probe (Alk-C16) between three individual pairs of androgen-treated and non-treated LNCaP cells. Results: We identified 4351 unique peptides corresponding to 835 proteins, among them a number of these identified proteins were palmitoylated proteins, particularly eIF3L. Androgen treatment significantly increased the palmitoylation level of eIF3L, an individual subunit of eIF3. As an initiation factor, eIF3L plays a pivotal role in the translation of mRNAs encoding growth-promoting proteins by enhancing translation rates, thus controlling cell proliferation. Conclusion: In this study, we demonstrated that the regulation of eIF3L palmitoylation may provide new directions for the therapy of prostate cancer. Moreover, the increased level of androgen-induced eIF3L may be used as a biomarker for the diagnosis of early-stage prostate cancer.""","""['Luwei Cui', 'Ming Liu', 'Shicong Lai', 'Huimin Hou', 'Tongxiang Diao', 'Dalei Zhang', 'Miao Wang', 'Yaoguang Zhang', 'Jianye Wang']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Onco Targets Ther""","""['Palmitoylome profiling indicates that androgens regulate the palmitoylation of α‑tubulin in prostate cancer‑derived LNCaP cells and supernatants.', 'Palmitoylome profiling indicates that androgens promote the palmitoylation of metabolism-related proteins in prostate cancer-derived LNCaP cells.', 'Androgen receptors in hormone-dependent and castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Role of the Androgen-Androgen Receptor Axis in the Treatment Resistance of Advanced Prostate Cancer: From Androgen-Dependent to Castration Resistant and Further.', 'Androgen receptor-dependent and -independent mechanisms driving prostate cancer progression: Opportunities for therapeutic targeting from multiple angles.', 'Advancements in Oncoproteomics Technologies: Treading toward Translation into Clinical Practice.', 'Quantification of Protein Palmitoylation by Cysteine-SILAC.', 'Protein palmitoylation in cancer: molecular functions and therapeutic potential.', 'Functions and mechanisms of N6‑methyladenosine in prostate cancer (Review).', 'Prostate Cancer Progression: as a Matter of Fats.']"""

We compared KLF4 null cells with cells transduced with a DOX-inducible KLF4 expression system, and find KLF4 function inhibits PC3 growth in monolayer and soft agar cultures. Furthermore, KLF4 null cells proliferate rapidly, forming large, invasive, and osteolytic tumors when injected into mouse femurs, whereas KLF4 re-expression immediately after their intra-femoral inoculation blocks tumor development and preserves a normal bone architecture. KLF4 re-expression in established KLF4 null bone tumors inhibits their osteolytic effects, preventing bone fractures and inducing an osteogenic response with new bone formation. In addition to these profound biological changes, KLF4 also induces a transcriptional shift from an osteolytic program in KLF4 null cells to an osteogenic program.

A potential strategy for reducing the cost, study time, and contrast-associated risks associated with MP-MRI is elimination of the dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) sequence, relying instead on biparametric MRI (BP-MRI). BP-MRI has been shown to have a diagnostic accuracy and cancer detection rate that are equivalent to those of MP-MRI.  Methods:   We modeled the potential cost of BP-MRI compared to MP-MRI to determine what cost savings would occur if DCE was eliminated from these studies.

Patients and methods:   All patients undergoing RP from 2006 to 2014 with an admitting or principal diagnosis of prostate cancer were identified. All 40,533 cases were separated into volume groups stratified by hospital and physician quartiles with a goal of maintaining consistent numbers between the 4 volume groups. Patient-level data included race, ethnicity, Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI), median income by zip code, and source of payment. Hospital-level data included hospital location, teaching status, health service area, and facility number. Continuous and categorical variables were compared between cohorts using the Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon test and Pearson χ2 tests, respectively. Multivariate regression analysis was conducted to assess predictors of access to very high-volume facilities and physician groups as well as predictors of receiving a minimally invasive RP.  Results:   Of 40,533 total cases, 9602 (24%) were conducted at low-volume hospitals, 9208 (22%) were conducted at medium-volume hospitals, 8478 (21%) were conducted at high-volume hospitals, and 13,245 (33%) were conducted at very high-volume hospitals. Negative predictors of receiving care from a very high-volume physician include increased CCI, Asian race, black race, unknown race, Medicaid status, age 65 to 79 years, and age 80 to 130 years (P < .001). Negative predictors of receiving care from a very high-volume facility include Asian race, black race, unknown race, Medicaid status, and self-payment status (P < .001).

However, whether they should be combined with repeated SBs remains unclear.  Objective:   To evaluate the value of repeated SBs in addition to TBs in patients with a prior negative SB and a persistent suspicion of prostate cancer (PCa).  Design, setting, and participants:   A prospective study as part of a multicenter randomized controlled trial conducted between 2014 and 2017, including 665 men with a prior negative SB and a persistent suspicion of PCa (suspicious digital rectal examination and/or prostate-specific antigen >4.0ng/ml).  Intervention:   All patients underwent 3T mpMRI according to Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) v2. Patients with PI-RADS ≥3 were randomized 1:1:1 for three TB techniques: MRI-TRUS fusion TB (FUS-TB), cognitive registration fusion TB (COG-TB), or in-bore MRI TB. FUS-TB and COG-TB were combined with repeated SBs.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Clinically significant prostate cancer (csPCa) was defined as Gleason ≥3+4. Differences in detection rates of csPCa, clinically insignificant PCa (cisPCa), and overall PCa between TBs (FUS-TB and COG-TB) and repeated SBs were compared using McNemar's test.  Results and limitations:   In the 152 patients who underwent both TB and SB, PCa was detected by TB in 47% and by SB in 32% (p<0.001, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 6.0-22%). TB detected significantly more csPCa than SB (32% vs 16%; p<0.001, 95% CI: 11-25%). Clinically significant PCa was missed by TB in 1.3% (2/152). Combining SB and TB resulted in detection rate differences of 6.0% for PCa, 5.0% for cisPCa, and 1.0% for csPCa compared with TB alone.  Conclusions:   In case of a persistent suspicion of PCa following a negative SB, TB detected significantly more csPCa cases than SB. The additional value of SB was limited, and only 1.3% of csPCa would have been missed when SB had been omitted.

Therapeutic adenoviral vectors or oncolytic adenoviruses offer the possibility of a competent, nontoxic therapeutic alternative for prostate cancer. However, free viral particles must be delivered locally, an approach that does not address metastatic disease, and they display poor tumor penetration. To fully exploit the potential of these vectors, we must develop methods that improve intratumoral dissemination and allow for systemic delivery. This study establishes a proof-of-principle rationale for a novel human mesenchymal stem (stromal) cell-based approach to improving vector delivery to tumors.  Methods/results:   We have generated mesenchymal stem cell-derived packaging cells for adenoviruses (E1-modified mesenchymal stem cells) by modifying human mesenchymal stem cells with the adenovirus (type C) E1A/B genes needed for viral replication. Using cell-based assays, we have demonstrated that two adenoviral vectors, replication-defective adenovirus expressing p14 and p53 or conditionally replicating oncolytic adenovirus, packaged by E1A/B-modified mesenchymal stem cells, suppress the growth of prostate cancer cells in culture. Using subcutaneous xenograft models for human prostate cancer in mice, we have shown that E1A/B-modified mesenchymal stem cells display tumor tropism in tumor-bearing nude mice, that E1A/B-modified mesenchymal stem cells disseminate well within tumors, and that replication-defective adenovirus expressing p14 and p53 or conditionally replicating oncolytic adenovirus-loaded E1-modified mesenchymal stem cells suppresses tumor growth in mice.

Dysregulation of microRNAs (miRNAs), small non-coding RNA molecules with gene expression regulatory function, has been reported in all types of epithelial and haematological cancers. In particular, miR-221-5p alterations have been reported in PCa.  Methods:   miRNA expression data was retrieved from a comprehensive publicly available dataset of 218 PCa patients (GSE21036) and miR-221-5p expression levels were analysed. The functional role of miR-221-5p was characterised in androgen- dependent and androgen- independent PCa cell line models (C4-2 and PC-3M-Pro4 cells) by miR-221-5p overexpression and knock-down experiments. The metastatic potential of highly aggressive PC-3M-Pro4 cells overexpressing miR-221-5p was determined by studying extravasation in a zebrafish model. Finally, the effect of miR-221-5p overexpression on the growth of PC-3M-Pro4luc2 cells in vivo was studied by orthotopic implantation in male Balb/cByJ nude mice and assessment of tumor growth.  Results:   Analysis of microRNA expression dataset for human primary and metastatic PCa samples and control normal adjacent benign prostate revealed miR-221-5p to be significantly downregulated in PCa compared to normal prostate tissue and in metastasis compared to primary PCa. Our in vitro data suggest that miR-221-5p overexpression reduced PCa cell proliferation and colony formation. Furthermore, miR-221-5p overexpression dramatically reduced migration of PCa cells, which was associated with differential expression of selected EMT markers. The functional changes of miR-221-5p overexpression were reversible by the loss of miR-221-5p levels, indicating that the tumor suppressive effects were specific to miR-221-5p. Additionally, miR-221-5p overexpression significantly reduced PC-3M-Pro4 cell extravasation and metastasis formation in a zebrafish model and decreased tumor burden in an orthotopic mouse model of PCa.

General practitioners have assumed a growing role in the cancer patient disease trajectory because of their roles as coordinators and the consistent health provider. However, general practitioners are challenged in providing support for cancer patients both during treatment and in the survivorship phase. General practitioners reported barriers are lack of timely and relevant communication from the oncologist and limited knowledge to guidelines, as well as lack of trust from patients. Therefore, the current study will examine whether a shared video-based consultation between the cancer patient, general practitioner and oncologist can ease general' challenges and thereby enhance the patient-centeredness for the cancer patients and their perception of intersectoral cooperation and continuity.  Methods:   The study is designed as a pragmatic randomised controlled trial for patients starting chemotherapy at the Department of Oncology, Lillebaelt Hospital, Denmark who are listed with a general practitioner in the Region of Southern Denmark. We intend to include 278 adults diagnosed with colorectal, breast, lung, gynecologic or prostate cancer. The intervention group will receive the ""Partnership intervention"" which consists of one or more video-consultations between the cancer patient, general practitioner and oncologist. The consultations are estimated to last between 10 and 20 min. The specific aims of the consultation are, summary of the patient trajectory, sharing of knowledge regarding comorbidity, psychosocial resources and needs, physical well-being, medicine, anxiety and depression symptoms, spouses, workability and late complication and side-effects to the cancer treatment.

While the identification of genes playing a specific role in each cancer type brings invaluable insights for gene therapy research by targeting disease-specific cell functions not accounted so far, identifying a common gene signature to breast and prostate cancers could unravel new targets to tackle shared hormone-dependent disease features, like bone relapse. This would potentially allow the development of new targeted therapies directed to genes regulating both cancer types, with a consequent positive impact in cancer management and health economics.  Results:   We address the challenge of extracting gene signatures from transcriptomic data of prostate adenocarcinoma (PRAD) and breast invasive carcinoma (BRCA) samples, particularly estrogen positive (ER+), and androgen positive (AR+) triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), using sparse logistic regression. The introduction of gene network information based on the distances between BRCA and PRAD correlation matrices is investigated, through the proposed twin networks recovery (twiner) penalty, as a strategy to ensure similarly correlated gene features in two diseases to be less penalized during the feature selection procedure.  Conclusions:   Our analysis led to the identification of genes that show a similar correlation pattern in BRCA and PRAD transcriptomic data, and are selected as key players in the classification of breast and prostate samples into ER+ BRCA/AR+ TNBC/PRAD tumor and normal tissues, and also associated with survival time distributions. The results obtained are supported by the literature and are expected to unveil the similarities between the diseases, disclose common disease biomarkers, and help in the definition of new strategies for more effective therapies.""","""['Marta B Lopes', 'Sandra Casimiro', 'Susana Vinga']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""BMC Bioinformatics""","""['Comprehensive transcriptome analysis identifies novel molecular subtypes and subtype-specific RNAs of triple-negative breast cancer.', 'Exploring novel targets of basal-like breast carcinoma by comparative gene profiling and mechanism analysis.', 'The presence and impact of estrogen metabolism on the biology of triple-negative breast cancer.', 'Role of the androgen receptor in triple-negative breast cancer.', 'A targetable androgen receptor-positive breast cancer subtype hidden among the triple-negative cancers.', 'Identification of biomarkers predictive of metastasis development in early-stage colorectal cancer using network-based regularization.', 'Kidney Cancer Biomarker Selection Using Regularized Survival Models.', 'Coupling sparse Cox models with clustering of longitudinal transcriptomics data for trauma prognosis.', 'The Role of Network Science in Glioblastoma.', 'TCox: Correlation-Based Regularization Applied to Colorectal Cancer Survival Data.']"""

This failure invariably leads to castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) and the development of the neuroendocrine (NE) phenotype. The molecular basis for PCa progression remains unclear. Previously, we and others have demonstrated that the sex-determining region Y-box 4 (SOX4) gene, a critical developmental transcription factor, is overexpressed and associated with poor prognosis in PCa patients. In this study, we show that SOX4 expression is associated with PCa progression and the development of the NE phenotype in androgen deprivation conditions. High-throughput microRNA profiling and bioinformatics analyses suggest that SOX4 may target the miR-17-92 cluster. SOX4 transcriptionally upregulates miR-17-92 cluster expression in PCa cells. SOX4-induced PCa cell proliferation, migration, and invasion are also mediated by miR-17-92 cluster members. Furthermore, RB1 is a target gene of miR-17-92 cluster. We found that SOX4 downregulates RB1 protein expression by upregulating the miR-17-92 expression. In addition, SOX4-knockdown restrains NE phenotype and PCa cell proliferation. Clinically, the overexpression of miR-17-92 members is shown to be positively correlated with SOX4 expression in PCa patients, whereas RB1 expression is negatively correlated with SOX4 expression in patients with the aggressive PCa phenotype. Collectively, we propose a novel model of a SOX4/miR-17-92/RB1 axis that may exist to promote PCa progression.""","""['Hui Liu', 'Zhen Wu', 'Haibin Zhou', 'Wenjie Cai', 'Xinjun Li', 'Jing Hu', 'Lin Gao', 'Tingting Feng', 'Lin Wang', 'Xijia Peng', 'Mei Qi', 'Long Liu', 'Bo Han']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Neoplasia""","""['Estrogen induces androgen-repressed SOX4 expression to promote progression of prostate cancer cells.', 'MicroRNA-132/212 Upregulation Inhibits TGF-β-Mediated Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition of Prostate Cancer Cells by Targeting SOX4.', 'miR-30a inhibits androgen-independent growth of prostate cancer via targeting MYBL2, FOXD1, and SOX4.', 'SOX4: Epigenetic regulation and role in tumorigenesis.', 'RB1: a prototype tumor suppressor and an enigma.', 'Plasmatic MicroRNAs and Treatment Outcomes of Patients with Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer: A Hospital-Based Cohort Study and In Silico Analysis.', 'Temozolomide protects against the progression of glioblastoma via SOX4 downregulation by inhibiting the LINC00470-mediated transcription factor EGR2.', 'Novel biomarkers predict prognosis and drug-induced neuroendocrine differentiation in patients with prostate cancer.', 'Focus on the tumor microenvironment: A seedbed for neuroendocrine prostate cancer.', 'Overexpression of CDCA8 Predicts Poor Prognosis and Promotes Tumor Cell Growth in Prostate Cancer.']"""

Methods:   Bi-objective treatment planning is done using a state-of-the-art multiobjective evolutionary algorithm, which produces a large number of potential treatment plans with different trade-offs between coverage of the target volumes and sparing organs at risk. A graphics processing unit (GPU) is used for large-scale parallelization of dose calculations and the calculation of the dose-volume (DV) indices of potential treatment plans. Moreover, the objectives of the previously used bi-objective optimization model are modified to produce better results.  Results:   We applied the GPU-accelerated bi-objective treatment planning method to a set of 18 patients, resulting in a set containing a few hundred potential treatment plans with different trade-offs for each of these patients. Due to accelerations introduced in this article, results previously achieved after 1 hour are now achieved within 30 seconds of optimization. We found plans satisfying the clinical protocol for 15 of 18 patients, whereas this was the case for only 4 of 18 clinical plans. Higher quality treatment plans are obtained when the accuracy of DV index calculation is increased using more dose calculation points, requiring still no more than 3 minutes of optimization for 100 000 points.  Conclusions:   Large sets of high-quality treatment plans that trade-off coverage and sparing are now achievable within 30 seconds, due to the GPU-acceleration of a previously introduced bi-objective treatment planning method for prostate HDR brachytherapy. Higher quality plans can be achieved when optimizing for 3 minutes, which we still consider to be clinically acceptable.

While a goal of these changes is to decrease over diagnosis and treatment, little is known about the downstream effects on PCa risk distribution at the time of diagnosis. To better understand these effects, we used a national cohort of men to investigate temporal trends in PCa risk profile at diagnosis.  Methods:   Using the National Cancer Database, we identified men diagnosed with biopsy-confirmed clinically localized prostate adenocarcinoma (T1-4N0M0) from 2004 to 2014. We assessed temporal trends in proportional distribution of National Comprehensive Cancer Network risk groups as well as their sub-components (PSA, Gleason score, clinical T stage). We also evaluated trends in these sub-components among men with intermediate- and high-risk disease as well as those with metastatic disease.  Results:   In our cohort of 755,567 men diagnosed between 2004 and 2014, there was a decrease in the proportion of men diagnosed with low-risk PCa (38.32 to 27.23%, p < 0.001) and a consequent increase in the proportion of localized intermediate-risk (40.49 to 46.72%, p < 0.001) and high-risk diagnoses (21.19 to 26.05%, p < 0.001). This was primarily driven by an increased proportion of Gleason 7 and Gleason 8-10 cancer, respectively. The number of men presenting with metastatic disease consistently increased from 3251 (2.88%) in 2004 to 6886 (7.19%) in 2014 (p < 0.001).  Conclusions:   The proportion of localized intermediate/high risk and metastatic PCa has substantially increased over the past decade, while the proportion of low-risk disease has decreased. This shift has been primarily driven by increased diagnosis of high-grade disease.

This is unlikely due to lack of estrogens alone. We proposed that it is the negative influence of androgens on the growth of ER(+) breast cancer. We investigated the influence of Formestane and Exemestane and of their major androgenic metabolites 4-hydroxytestosterone and 17-hydroexemestane on the proliferation of MCF-7 cells and ZR-75-1 cells. Inhibitory effects could be prevented by antiandrogens and siRNA. Activation of the AR in MCF-7 and U2-OS cells was tested by reporter gene assays. In vivo androgenicity was evaluated using the Hershberger assay. Influence on the cell cycle was demonstrated by flow-cytometry. Influence of androgens on the activity of CCND1 was demonstrated by Chip-qPCR. Antitumor activity was determined by topical treatment of DMBA tumors. We found that breast cancer cells can metabolize Formestane and Exemestane to androgenic compounds which inhibit proliferation. This can be explained by hindering the accessibility of CCND1 by histone modification. Androgenic metabolites can abolish the growth of DMBA-tumors and prevent the appearance of new tumors. The lack of cross-resistance between steroidal and nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitors is due to inhibitory effects of androgenic steroidal metabolites on the production of cyclin D1. These sterols not only inhibit proliferation of cancer cells but can also stop the growth of DMBA cancers upon direct absorption into the tumor.

We examined the relation of Mediterranean diet (MD) adherence with risks of prostate and bladder cancer in the Netherlands Cohort Study (NLCS).  Methods:   Data were available for 58,279 men and 62,573 women, who completed a baseline questionnaire on diet and other cancer risk factors. Multiple MD scores, including the alternate Mediterranean diet score without alcohol (aMEDr), were calculated to assess MD adherence. After 20.3 years of follow-up, 3,868 prostate cancer cases (advanced: 1,256) and 1,884 bladder cancer cases could be included in multivariable Cox proportional hazards analyses.  Results:   aMEDr was not associated with advanced prostate cancer risk [hazard ratio (HR)per 2-point increment (95% confidence interval, 95% CI) = 1.06 (0.96-1.17)]. In contrast, higher aMEDr values were associated with a significantly increased risk of nonadvanced prostate cancer (P trend = 0.04).

Absolute scores based on the World Cancer Research Fund/American Institute for Cancer Research (WCRF/AICR) dietary recommendations were not associated with prostate or bladder cancer risk.  Conclusions:   MD adherence, measured by aMEDr or other MD scores, was not associated with decreased risks of advanced prostate cancer and bladder cancer in the NLCS. Higher levels of care-seeking behavior, screening attendance, and prostate cancer awareness in higher educated men with healthier lifestyles could potentially explain the positive associations observed for nonadvanced prostate cancer risk.

Objective:   To (1) describe uptake and surveillance intensity of real-world use of AS and compare with national guidelines, and (2) describe transitions from conservative to curative treatment by different indications of disease progression.  Design, setting, and participants:   A population-based cohort study of men diagnosed with low-risk prostate cancer, in Stockholm County, Sweden, during 2008-2017. Follow-up was up to 10yr, with a median of 3.5yr.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Poisson regression was used to estimate incidence rate ratios of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing and biopsies. Cox regression was used to estimate hazard ratios of starting curative treatment.  Results and limitations:   A total of 6021 men with low-risk prostate cancer were included in the analysis; 3116 (52%) had AS recorded as the intended primary management (AS cohort). During 1, 2, and 3yr after diagnosis, the frequencies of at least one PSA test were 90%, 92%, and 88%, respectively, and those of postdiagnostic surveillance biopsies were 42%, 19% and 18%, respectively. During surveillance, 13% of men in the AS cohort were upgraded on rebiopsy, with Gleason upgrading being the strongest factor for starting curative treatment. One limitation is the generalizability to other populations because of differences between surveillance protocols and clinical settings.  Conclusions:   Our results show that AS is underutilized and that monitoring differs from current guidelines.

Methods:   Reimbursement records for 874,924 patients diagnosed between 2002 and 2014 with primary PCa according to the International Classification of Disease (ICD) 10th revision code C61 were accessed. To assess direct medical costs for patients newly diagnosed after 2005, data from 68,596 patients managed between January 2005 and 31 December 2014 were evaluated.  Results:   From 2005 to 2014, the total number of PCa patients showed a 2.6-fold increase. Surgery and androgen deprivation therapy were the most common first-line treatment, alone or within the context of combined therapy. Surgery as a monotherapy was performed in 23.5% of patients in 2005, and in 39.4% of patients in 2014. From 2008, the rate of robot-assisted RP rose sharply, showing a similar rate to open RP in 2014. Average total treatment costs in the 12 months post-diagnosis were around 10 million Korean won. Average annual treatment costs thereafter were around 5 million Korean won. Out-of-pocket expenditure was highest in the first year post-diagnosis, and ranged from 12 to 17% thereafter.

Chemically two groups of BPs are recognized, non-nitrogen-containing and nitrogen-containing BPs. Non-nitrogen-containing BPs incorporate into the energy pathways of the osteoclast, resulting in disrupted cellular energy metabolism leading to cytotoxic effects and osteoclast apoptosis. Nitrogen-containing BPs primarily inhibit cholesterol biosynthesis resulting in the disruption of intracellular signaling, and other cellular processes in the osteoclast. BODY: BPs also exert a wide range of physiologic activities beyond merely the inhibition of bone resorption. Indeed, the breadth of reported activities include inhibition of cancer cell metastases, proliferation and apoptosis in vitro. In addition, the inhibition of angiogenesis, matrix metalloproteinase activity, altered cytokine and growth factor expression, and reductions in pain have been reported. In humans, clinical BP use has transformed the treatment of both post-menopausal osteoporosis and metastatic breast and prostate cancer. However, BP use has also resulted in significant adverse events including acute-phase reactions, esophagitis, gastritis, and an association with very infrequent atypical femoral fractures (AFF) and osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ).  Conclusion:   Despite the well-characterized health benefits of BP use in humans, little is known regarding the effects of BPs in the horse. In the equine setting, only non-nitrogen-containing BPs are FDA-approved primarily for the treatment of navicular syndrome. The focus here is to discuss the current understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of BPs in equine veterinary medicine and highlight the future utility of these potentially highly beneficial drugs.""","""['Alexis Mitchell', 'Ashlee E Watts', 'Frank H Ebetino', 'Larry J Suva']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""BMC Vet Res""","""['Bisphosphonates in veterinary medicine: The new horizon for use.', 'Revival of nitrogen-containing bisphosphonate-induced inhibition of osteoclastogenesis and osteoclast function by water-soluble microfibrous borate glass.', 'Bisphosphonates: the first 40 years.', 'ATRAID regulates the action of nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates on bone.', 'Nitrogen-containing bisphosphonate mechanism of action.', 'Is the Use of Bisphosphonates Putting Horses at Risk?

The survey includes PA levels before and after prostate cancer diagnosis, exercise barriers, and preferences.Results: Moderate- to vigorous-intensity PA levels were significantly lower after cancer diagnosis (vigorous PA:41.9 ± 123.1 min/week vs. 4.6 ± 29.8 min/week, p < 0.001; moderate PA: 159.9 ± 240.0 min/week vs. 56.8 ± 129.7 min/week, p < .001) compared to their PA level before cancer diagnosis. Perceived exercise barriers were distinctly different according to participants' age and time since surgery. The two most prevalent exercise barriers among prostate cancer survivors <65 years were lack of time (28.6%) and poor health (26.5%), whereas the exercise barriers for prostate cancer survivors aged ≥65 years were lack of exercise facilities (21.4%) and lack of exercise information (17.9%). Furthermore, within 6 months after surgery, prostate cancer survivors perceived poor health (29.5%) and pain at the surgery site (29.5%) to be the two most prevalent exercise barriers. 6 months after surgery, prostate cancer survivors perceived lack of time (21.3%) and poor health (14.8%) to be the two most prevalent exercise barriers. Walking, pelvic floor and Kegel exercises were three most preferred exercises among prostate cancer survivors in our study, which uniquely differ according to time since surgery.Conclusion: This study showed significant reduction in PA levels among prostate cancer survivors and their perceived exercise barriers were distinct according to their age and time since surgery.

We hypothesized that PXDN promotes prostate cancer progression via regulation of metabolic and oxidative stress pathways. We analyzed PXDN expression in prostate tissue by immunohistochemistry and found increased PXDN expression with prostate cancer progression as compared to normal tissue or cells. PXDN knockdown followed by proteomic analysis revealed an increase in oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction and gluconeogenesis pathways. Additionally, Liquid Chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS)-based metabolomics confirmed that PXDN knockdown induced global reprogramming associated with increased oxidative stress and decreased nucleotide biosynthesis. We further demonstrated that PXDN knockdown led to an increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) associated with decreased cell viability and increased apoptosis. Finally, PXDN knockdown decreased colony formation on soft agar. Overall, the data suggest that PXDN promotes progression of prostate cancer by regulating the metabolome, more specifically, by inhibiting oxidative stress leading to decreased apoptosis.

Study design:   This is a cross-sectional analysis using The Irish Longitudinal Study on Ageing (TILDA).  Methods:   The analysis included 6902 people aged 50 years and older who completed an in-house interview as part of TILDA. The interview collects information on a range of demographic, socio-economic, health and health service usage variables including the uptake of cancer screening services. An eligibility variable was created using information on public healthcare entitlement and PHI status. The association between eligibility and the uptake of two cancer screening services-mammogram and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test-was examined using weighted multivariate logistic regression analysis.  Results:   The uptake of a mammogram and PSA testing was significantly higher in those with PHI. This relationship held after controlling for a range of confounders including health and socio-economic status.  Conclusions:   More research is required to identify the reasons for the higher uptake of cancer screening services among those with PHI, given that insurance does not confer any advantages in accessing these services. It is possible that the higher uptake is explained by differential access to secondary care services between those with and without PHI.

Methods and materials:   The study population consisted of 506 patients with prostate cancer collected from a clinically annotated database. After applying exclusion criteria, 342 patients were included in the final analysis. CT-based radiomics features were extracted from planning CT scans for prostate gland-only structure, and machine learning was used to train models for Gleason score (GS) and risk group (RG) classifications. Repeated cross-validation was used. The discriminatory performance of the developed models was assessed using receiver operating characteristic area under the curve (AUC) analysis.  Results:   Classifiers using CT-based radiomics features distinguished between GS ≤ 6 versus GS ≥ 7 with AUC = 0.90 and GS 7(3 + 4) versus GS 7(4 + 3) with AUC = 0.98. Developed classifiers also showed excellent performance in distinguishing low versus high RG (AUC = 0.96) and low versus intermediate RG (AUC = 1.00), but poorer performance was observed for GS 7 versus GS > 7 (AUC = 0.69). An overall modest performance was observed for validation on holdout data sets with the highest AUC of 0.75 for classifiers of low versus high RG and an AUC of 0.70 for GS 7 versus GS > 7.  Conclusions:   Our results show that radiomics features from routinely acquired planning CT scans could provide insights into prostate cancer aggressiveness in a noninvasive manner. Assessing models on training data sets, the classifiers were especially accurate in discerning high-risk from low-risk patients and in classifying GS 7 versus GS > 7 and GS 7(3 + 4) versus G7(4 + 3); however, classifiers were less adept at distinguishing high RG versus intermediate RG.

Dog BC resembles human muscle-invasive BC in histopathological characteristics and gene expression profiles, and could be an important research model for this disease. Cancer patient-derived organoid culture can recapitulate organ structures and maintains the gene expression profiles of original tumor tissues. In a previous study, we generated dog prostate cancer organoids using urine samples, however dog BC organoids had never been produced. Therefore we aimed to generate dog BC organoids using urine samples and check their histopathological characteristics, drug sensitivity, and gene expression profiles. Organoids from individual BC dogs were successfully generated, expressed urothelial cell markers (CK7, CK20, and UPK3A) and exhibited tumorigenesis in vivo. In a cell viability assay, the response to combined treatment with a range of anticancer drugs (cisplatin, vinblastine, gemcitabine or piroxicam) was markedly different in each BC organoid. In RNA-sequencing analysis, expression levels of basal cell markers (CK5 and DSG3) and several novel genes (MMP28, CTSE, CNN3, TFPI2, COL17A1, and AGPAT4) were upregulated in BC organoids compared with normal bladder tissues or two-dimensional (2D) BC cell lines. These established dog BC organoids might be a useful tool, not only to determine suitable chemotherapy for BC diseased dogs but also to identify novel biomarkers in human muscle-invasive BC. In the present study, for the 1st time, dog BC organoids were generated and several specifically upregulated organoid genes were identified.

C16 augmented invadopodia activity of DU145 cells, and stimulated expression Tks4, Tks5, cortactin, and membrane-type matrix metalloproteinase 1. Reactive oxygen species generation is also related to invadopodia formation. This prompted us to address whether C16 would induce reactive oxygen species generation in DU145 cells. Quantitative fluorescence and flow cytometry showed that the peptide C16 increased reactive oxygen species in DU145 cells.

Patients and methods:   In a prospective study, 65 consecutive patients who developed BCR after RP underwent SLND after PSMA-11 PET/CT(MRI) between 2014 and 2018. Extended SLND up to the inferior mesenteric artery was performed in all patients. Regional and template-based correlations between the presence of LN metastases on histopathology and whole-body PSMA-11 PET/CT(MRI) results were evaluated. The diagnostic accuracy of PSMA-11 PET/CT(MRI) was also evaluated in relation to PSA level at the time of SLND.  Results:   The median age of the patients at the time of SLND was 65 years (IQR 63-69 years) and the median PSA level was 1.4 ng/ml (IQR 0.8-2.9 ng/ml). Before SLND, 50 patients (77%) had additional therapy after RP (26.2% androgen-deprivation therapy and 50.8% radiotherapy). The median number of LNs removed on SLND was 40 (IQR 33-48) and the median number of positive nodes was 4 (IQR 2-6). LN metastases were seen in 13.8% of resected LNs (317 of 2,292). LNs positive on PSMA-11 PET/CT(MRI) had a median diameter of 7.2 mm (IQR 5.3-9 mm). Metastatic LNs in regions negative on PSMA-11 PET had a median diameter of 3.4 mm (IQR 2.1-5.4 mm). In a regional analysis, the sensitivity of PSMA-11 PET/CT(MRI) ranged from 72% to 100%, and the specificity from 96% to 100%. Region-specific positive and negative predictive values ranged from 95% to 100% and 93% to 100%, respectively.  Conclusion:   PSMA-11 PET/CT(MRI) has a very good performance for the identification of LN metastases in patients with BCR after RP. The high diagnostic accuracy in the regional and subregional analyses demonstrates the potential of this approach to enable a region-directed instead of a complete bilateral therapeutic intervention.

The membrane-bound matrix metalloproteinase MT1-MMP (MMP14) is internalized by endocytosis and recycled in endosomal compartments. It is largely unknown how endosomal sorting and recycling of MT1-MMP are controlled. Here, we show that the endosomal protein WDFY2 controls the recycling of MT1-MMP. WDFY2 localizes to endosomal tubules by binding to membranes enriched in phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PtdIns3P). We identify the v-SNARE VAMP3 as an interaction partner of WDFY2. WDFY2 knockout causes a strong redistribution of VAMP3 into small vesicles near the plasma membrane. This is accompanied by increased, VAMP3-dependent secretion of MT1-MMP, enhanced degradation of extracellular matrix, and increased cell invasion. WDFY2 is frequently lost in metastatic cancers, most predominantly in ovarian and prostate cancer. We propose that WDFY2 acts as a tumor suppressor by serving as a gatekeeper for VAMP3 recycling.""","""['Marte Sneeggen', 'Nina Marie Pedersen', 'Coen Campsteijn', 'Ellen Margrethe Haugsten', 'Harald Stenmark', 'Kay Oliver Schink']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Nat Commun""","""['VAMP3, syntaxin-13 and SNAP23 are involved in secretion of matrix metalloproteinases, degradation of the extracellular matrix and cell invasion.', 'DLC3 suppresses MT1-MMP-dependent matrix degradation by controlling RhoB and actin remodeling at endosomal membranes.', 'Tumor suppression by control of matrix metalloproteinase recycling.', 'Matrix invasion by tumour cells: a focus on MT1-MMP trafficking to invadopodia.', 'MT1-MMP and MMP-7 in invasion and metastasis of human cancers.', 'Cytoplasmic Tail of MT1-MMP: A Hub of MT1-MMP Regulation and Function.', 'Integrating intracellular nanovesicles into integrin trafficking pathways and beyond.', 'Endocytic trafficking of GAS6-AXL complexes is associated with sustained AKT activation.', 'Study on the Expression Profile of Autophagy-Related Genes in Colon Adenocarcinoma.', 'The core autophagy protein ATG9A controls dynamics of cell protrusions and directed migration.']"""

We developed prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA)-targeted low-molecular-weight agents for 212Pb-based TRT of patients with prostate cancer (PC) by evaluating the matching γ-emitting surrogate, 203Pb. Methods: Five rationally designed low-molecular-weight ligands (L1-L5) were synthesized using the lysine-urea-glutamate scaffold, and PSMA inhibition constants were determined. Tissue biodistribution and SPECT/CT imaging of 203Pb-L1-203Pb-L5 were performed on mice bearing PSMA(+) PC3 PIP and PSMA(-) PC3 flu flank xenografts. The absorbed radiation dose of the corresponding 212Pb-labeled analogs was determined using the biodistribution data. Antitumor efficacy of 212Pb-L2 was evaluated in PSMA(+) PC3 PIP and PSMA(-) PC3 flu tumor models and in the PSMA(+) luciferase-expressing micrometastatic model. 212Pb-L2 was also evaluated for dose-escalated, long-term toxicity. Results: All new ligands were obtained in high yield and purity. PSMA inhibitory activities ranged from 0.10 to 17 nM. 203Pb-L1-203Pb-L5 were synthesized in high radiochemical yield and specific activity. Whole-body clearance of 203Pb-L1-203Pb-L5 was fast. The absorbed dose coefficients (mGy/kBq) of the tumor and kidneys were highest for 203Pb-L5 (31.0, 15.2) and lowest for 203Pb-L2 (8.0, 4.2). The tumor-to-kidney absorbed dose ratio was higher for 203Pb-L3 (3.2) and 203Pb-L4 (3.6) than for the other agents, but with lower tumor-to-blood ratios. PSMA(+) tumor lesions were visualized through SPECT/CT as early as 0.5 h after injection. A proof-of-concept therapy study with a single administration of 212Pb-L2 demonstrated dose-dependent inhibition of tumor growth in the PSMA(+) flank tumor model. 212Pb-L2 also demonstrated an increased survival benefit in the micrometastatic model compared with 177Lu-PSMA-617.

The purpose of this retrospective study was to evaluate the frequency of non-tumor-related uptake and the detection efficacy comparing 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT and 18F-PSMA-1007 PET/CT in recurrent prostate cancer (PC) patients. Methods: The study included 102 patients with biochemically recurrent PC after radical prostatectomy undergoing 18F-PSMA-1007 PET/CT imaging. On the basis of various clinical variables, patients with corresponding 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT scans were matched. All PET/CT scans (n = 204) were reviewed by 1 nuclear medicine physician. First, all PET-positive lesions were noted. Then, lesions suspected of being recurrent PC were differentiated from lesions attributed to a benign origin on the basis of known pitfalls and information from CT. For each region, the SUVmax of the lesion with the highest PSMA-ligand uptake was noted. Detection rates were determined, and SUVmax was compared separately for 68Ga-PSMA-11 and 18F-PSMA-1007. Results: In total, 18F-PSMA-1007 PET and 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET revealed 369 and 178 PSMA-ligand-positive lesions, respectively. 18F-PSMA-1007 PET revealed approximately 5 times more lesions attributed to a benign origin than did 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET (245 vs. 52 lesions, respectively). The benign lesions most frequently observed were ganglia, unspecific lymph node, and bone lesions, at a rate of 43%, 31%, and 24% for 18F-PSMA-1007 PET and 29%, 42%, and 27% for 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET, respectively. The SUVmax of lesions attributed to a benign origin was significantly higher (P < 0.0001) for 18F-PSMA-1007 PET. Further, a similar number of lesions was attributed to recurrent PC (124/369 for 18F-PSMA-1007 PET and 126/178 for 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET). Conclusion: The number of lesions with increased PSMA-ligand uptake attributed to a benign origin is considerably higher for 18F-PSMA-1007 PET than for 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET.

Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are emerging as critical regulatory elements of many cellular biological processes, and may serve as therapeutic targets for combating PCa progression. Here, we have discovered in a high-throughput RNAi screen a novel lncRNA in PCa, and assessed the oncogenic effects of this lncRNA.  Methods:   Rapid amplification of cDNA ends and sequencing was utilized to identify a previously unannotated lncRNA lying within exon six and the 3'UTR of the lymphocyte-specific protein tyrosine kinase (LCK) gene. The levels of HULLK in the presence or absence of hormone and/or enzalutamide or coregulator inhibitors were measured by quantitative PCR (qPCR). The determination of HULLK transcription and localization were characterized by strand-specific qPCR and cellular fractionation followed by qPCR, respectively. The correlation between HULLK expression and prostate cancer Gleason score was analyzed by droplet digital PCR. CyQuant assays were conducted to evaluate the effects of knocking down HULLK with shRNAs or overexpressing HULLK on cell growth.  Results:   In this study, a previously unannotated lncRNA lying within exon six and 3'UTR of the LCK gene was dramatically upregulated by androgen in a dose-dependent manner, and the anti-androgen enzalutamide completely blocked this hormone-induced increase. Therefore, we labeled this lncRNA ""HULLK"" for Hormone-Upregulated lncRNA within LCK. Binding sites for two AR coregulators p300 and Brd4 reside near the HULLK transcriptional start site (TSS), and inhibitors of these coregulators downregulated HULLK. HULLK is transcribed from the sense strand of DNA, and predominantly localizes to the cytoplasm. HULLK transcripts are not only expressed in prostate cancer cell lines, but also prostate cancer patient tissue. Remarkably, there was a significant positive correlation between HULLK expression and high-grade PCa in multiple cohorts. shRNAs targeting HULLK significantly decreased PCa cell growth. Moreover, cells overexpressing HULLK were hypersensitive to androgen stimulation.  Conclusions:   HULLK is a novel lncRNA situated within the LCK gene that may serve as an oncogene in PCa. Our data enhances our understanding of lncRNA biology and may assist in the development of additional biomarkers or more effective therapeutic targets for advanced PCa.""","""['Huy Q Ta', 'Hilary Whitworth', 'Yi Yin', 'Mark Conaway', 'Henry F Frierson Jr', 'Moray J Campbell', 'Ganesh V Raj', 'Daniel Gioeli']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Mol Cancer""","""['The long non-coding RNA PCAL7 promotes prostate cancer by strengthening androgen receptor signaling.', 'Novel lncRNA LINC00844 Regulates Prostate Cancer Cell Migration and Invasion through AR Signaling.', 'A novel androgen-reduced prostate-specific lncRNA, PSLNR, inhibits prostate-cancer progression in part by regulating the p53-dependent pathway.', 'Clinical prospects of long noncoding RNAs as novel biomarkers and therapeutic targets in prostate cancer.', 'Long noncoding RNA in prostate, bladder, and kidney cancer.', 'Roles of lncRNAs Mediating Wnt/β-Catenin Signaling in HCC.', 'Long non-coding RNA RP11-283G6.5 confines breast cancer development through modulating miR-188-3p/TMED3/Wnt/β-catenin signalling.', 'LNC00115 Mediates Cisplatin Resistance by Regulating the miR-7/ERK Signalling Pathway in Ovarian Cancer.', 'Long non-coding RNA ADAMTS9-AS1 suppresses colorectal cancer by inhibiting the Wnt/β-catenin signalling pathway and is a potential diagnostic biomarker.', 'LncRNA HOXA-AS2 promotes the progression of prostate cancer via targeting miR-509-3p/PBX3 axis.']"""

Here, key variables were investigated that influence siRNA loading into porous silicon nanoparticles. The effect of modifying the surface of porous silicon nanoparticles with various amino-functional molecules as well as the effects of salt and chaotropic agents in facilitating siRNA loading was examined. Maximum siRNA loading of 413 μg/(mg of porous silicon nanoparticles) was found when the nanoparticles were modified by a fourth generation polyamidoamine dendrimer.

With the use of hypofractionated schemes in prostate cancer, urethral sparing is essential; however, visualization of the prostatic urethra can be challenging because of the presence of benign prostatic hyperplasia as well as respiratory motion artifacts. The goal of this study was to compare the utility of 2 motion-insensitive, T2-weighted MRI pulse sequences for urethra visualization in the setting of MRI-based simulation.  Methods and materials:   Twenty-two patients undergoing MRI simulation without Foley catheters were imaged on a 3 Tesla MRI scanner between October 2018 and January 2019. Sagittal multislice data were acquired using (1) MultiVane XD radial sampling with parallel imaging acceleration (MVXD) and (2) single-shot fast-spin-echo (SSFSE) sequences with acquisition times of 2 to 3 minutes per sequence. For each examination, 2 genitourinary radiologists scored prostatic urethra visibility on a 1-to-5 scale and rated the signal-to-noise ratio and the presence of artifacts in each series.  Results:   Urethral visibility was scored higher in the MVXD series than in the SSFSE series in 18 of 22 cases (Reader 1) and 17 of 22 cases (Reader 2). The differences in scores between MVXD and SSFSE were statistically significant for both readers (P < .0001 for both, paired Student's t-test) and interobserver agreement was high (Cohen's kappa = 0.67). Both readers found the signal-to-noise ratio of the MVXD sequence to be superior in all cases. The MVXD sequence was found to generate more artifacts than the SSFSE sequence, but these tended to appear in the periphery and did not affect the ability to visualize the urethra.

Results:   The expression level of hnRNPM is gradually reduced in BPH, ADENO, and NEPC tissues and it is less expressed in more aggressive PCa cell lines. Overexpression of hnRNPM can significantly reduce Twist1 expression, which inhibits the migration and invasion of PCa cells in vitro. In PCa cells, overexpression of YY1 can promote epithelial-mesenchymal transition by reducing hnRNPM expression. Furthermore, this effect caused by overexpression of YY1 can be partially attenuated by simultaneous overexpression of hnRNPM.  Conclusions:   Our study demonstrates that hnRNPM negatively regulated PCa cell migration and invasion, and its expression can be transcriptionally inhibited by YY1. We speculated that hnRNPM may be a biomarker to assist in judging the aggressiveness of PCa.""","""['Tong Yang', 'Zesheng An', 'Changwen Zhang', 'Zhen Wang', 'Xiaoming Wang', 'Yan Liu', 'E Du', 'Ranlu Liu', 'Zhihong Zhang', 'Yong Xu']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['MicroRNA-132/212 Upregulation Inhibits TGF-β-Mediated Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition of Prostate Cancer Cells by Targeting SOX4.', 'Metastatic prostate cancer-associated P62 inhibits autophagy flux and promotes epithelial to mesenchymal transition by sustaining the level of HDAC6.', 'CRTAC1 (Cartilage acidic protein 1) inhibits cell proliferation, migration, invasion and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process in bladder cancer by downregulating Yin Yang 1 (YY1) to inactivate the TGF-β pathway.', 'Yin Yang 1: a multifaceted protein beyond a transcription factor.', 'Role of YY1 in the pathogenesis of prostate cancer and correlation with bioinformatic data sets of gene expression.', 'Targeting Transcription Factor YY1 for Cancer Treatment: Current Strategies and Future Directions.', 'Downregulation of HNRNPM inhibits cell proliferation and migration of hepatocellular carcinoma through MAPK/AKT signaling pathway.', 'SILAC kinase screen identifies potential MASTL substrates.', 'Protein signatures to distinguish aggressive from indolent prostate cancer.', 'YY1-mediated reticulocalbin-2 upregulation promotes the hepatocellular carcinoma progression via activating MYC signaling.']"""

Materials and methods:   We retrospectively collected data from mCRPC treated with abiraterone acetate and enzalutamide. Serum testosterone levels were collected at baseline, at 3 months since the start of therapy and at disease progression. A cohort of cases treated with docetaxel was also used to evaluate the impact of testosterone levels.  Results:   Patients treated with abiraterone with AR copy number aberrations and basal testosterone levels below 0.09 nmol/L had worse progression-free survival (PFS) compared to patients with no AR copy number abnormalities (8.5 vs 2.9 months, P = 0.005). No relevant differences were observed in the enzalutamide group with a PFS of 3.9 months (no AR gain) vs 2.7 months ( AR gain, P = 0.004) for patients with below 0.09 nmol/L testosterone levels. Similar results are obtained for univariate analysis for overall survival (OS). The negative prognostic role of AR copy number gain in OS for both treatment groups (25.5 vs 10.6 months, P = 0.0002 for abiraterone and 14.1 vs 8.3 months, P = 0.031 for enzalutamide) was confirmed, and it was recognized the negative prognostic impact of testosteronemia below 0.09 only for patients treated with enzalutamide (8.8 vs 42.8 months, P = 0.016). On multivariate analysis for patients treated with abiraterone, low testosterone levels below 0.09 and plasma AR gain were significantly associated with worse PFS and OS. These data are confirmed in the enzalutamide group for PFS.  Conclusions:   Testosterone levels and the AR copy number alterations were considered as independent prognostic factors. The results of this study show that serum testosteronemia associated with changes in copy number of AR gene could represent a noninvasive biomarker useful to identify a subgroup of patients with worse prognosis that can benefit less from second-generation antiandrogen therapies in the mCRPC setting.""","""['Cristian Lolli', 'Delia De Lisi', 'Vincenza Conteduca', 'Giorgia Gurioli', 'Emanuela Scarpi', 'Giuseppe Schepisi', 'Giorgia Ravaglia', 'Cecilia Menna', 'Alberto Farolfi', 'Amelia Altavilla', 'Salvatore Luca Burgio', 'Giuseppe Tonini', 'Daniele Santini', 'Ugo De Giorgi']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Androgen receptor gene status in plasma DNA associates with worse outcome on enzalutamide or abiraterone for castration-resistant prostate cancer: a multi-institution correlative biomarker study.', 'Plasma Androgen Receptor and Docetaxel for Metastatic Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'AR-V7 in Peripheral Whole Blood of Patients with Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer: Association with Treatment-specific Outcome Under Abiraterone and Enzalutamide.', 'Understanding and overcoming the mechanisms of primary and acquired resistance to abiraterone and enzalutamide in castration resistant prostate cancer.', 'Prostate cancer: AR aberrations and resistance to abiraterone or enzalutamide.', 'Prognostic role of docetaxel-induced suppression of free testosterone serum levels in metastatic prostate cancer patients.', 'A Prospective Study of the Relationship Between Clinical Outcomes After Enzalutamide and Serum Androgen Levels Measured via Liquid Chromatography-tandem Mass Spectrometry in Patients with Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Utility of Circulating Tumor DNA for Detection and Monitoring of Endometrial Cancer Recurrence and Progression.', 'Prognostic value of testosterone for the castration-resistant prostate cancer patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'How do we define ""castration"" in men on androgen deprivation therapy?']"""

Interestingly, PC1 regulates many signalling pathways including Jak/STAT, mTOR, Wnt, AP-1 and calcineurin-NFAT which are also used by cancer cells for sending signals that will allow them to acquire and maintain malignant phenotypes. Nevertheless, the molecular relationship between polycystins and cancer is unknown. In this study, we investigated the role of PC1 in cancer biology using glioblastoma (GOS3), prostate (PC3), breast (MCF7), lung (A549) and colorectal (HT29) cancer cell lines. Our in vitro results propose that PC1 promotes cell migration in GOS3 cells and suppresses cell migration in A549 cells. In addition, PC1 enhances cell proliferation in GOS3 cells but inhibits it in MCF7, A549 and HT29 cells. We also found that PC1 up-regulates mTOR signalling and down-regulates Jak signalling in GOS3 cells, while it up-regulates mTOR signalling in PC3 and HT29 cells. Together, our study suggests that PC1 modulates cell proliferation and migration and interacts with mTOR and Jak signalling pathways in different cancer cell lines.

The objective of this study was to define rates of conservative management for LRPC and associated short-term outcomes in young versus older men in the United States.  Methods:   The nonpublic Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Prostate with Active Surveillance/Watchful Waiting (AS/WW) Database identified 50,302 men who were diagnosed with LRPC from 2010 through 2015. AS/WW rates in the United States were stratified by age (≤55 vs ≥56 years). Prostate cancer-specific mortality and overall mortality were defined by initial management type (AS/WW vs definitive treatment [referent]) and age.  Results:   AS/WW utilization increased from 8.61% (2010) to 34.56% (2015) among men aged ≤55 years (P for trend <0.001) and from 15.99% to 43.81% among men aged ≥56 years (P for trend <.001). Among patients who had ≤2 positive biopsy cores, AS/WW rates increased from 12.90% to 48.78% for men aged ≤55 years and from 21.85% to 58.01% for men aged ≥56 years. Among patients who had ≥3 positive biopsy cores, AS/WW rates increased from 3.89% to 22.45% for men aged ≤55 years and from 10.05% to 28.49% for men aged ≥56 years (all P for trend <.001). Five-year prostate cancer-specific mortality rates were <0.30% across age and initial management type subgroups.  Conclusions:   AS/WW rates quadrupled for patients aged ≤55 years from 2010 to 2015, with favorable short-term outcomes. These findings demonstrate the short-term safety and increasing acceptance of AS/WW for both younger and older patients. However, there are still higher absolute rates of AS/WW in older patients (P < .001), suggesting some national ambivalence toward AS/WW in younger patients.""","""['Amandeep R Mahal', 'Santino Butler', 'Idalid Franco', 'Vinayak Muralidhar', 'Dalia Larios', 'Luke R G Pike', 'Shuang G Zhao', 'Nina N Sanford', 'Robert T Dess', 'Felix Y Feng', ""Anthony V D'Amico"", 'Daniel E Spratt', 'James B Yu', 'Paul L Nguyen', 'Timothy R Rebbeck', 'Brandon A Mahal']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Cancer""","""['Increasing the use of active surveillance for prostate cancer in younger men.', 'Active Surveillance Versus Watchful Waiting for Localized Prostate Cancer: A Model to Inform Decisions.', 'Temporarily deferred therapy (watchful waiting) for men younger than 70 years and with low-risk localized prostate cancer in the prostate-specific antigen era.', 'Time trends and characteristics of men choosing watchful waiting for initial treatment of localized prostate cancer: results from CaPSURE.', 'Active surveillance in men with localized prostate cancer: a systematic review.', 'Prostate-Specific Antigen-Based Screening for Prostate Cancer: Evidence Report and Systematic Review for the US Preventive Services Task Force.', 'Socioeconomic determinants are associated with the utilization and outcomes of active surveillance or watchful waiting in favorable-risk prostate cancer.', 'The impact of age on prostate cancer progression and quality of life in active surveillance patients.', 'Trends in treatments for prostate cancer in the United States, 2010-2015.', 'GPS Assay Association With Long-Term Cancer Outcomes: Twenty-Year Risk of Distant Metastasis and Prostate Cancer-Specific Mortality.', 'Prostate cancer in young men represents a distinct clinical phenotype: gene expression signature to predict early metastases.']"""

Acyl-biotinyl exchange (ABE), a widely used method for the enrichment of S-acylated proteins, has the potential of capturing the entire S-acylproteome in any type of biological sample. Here, we showed that current ABE methods suffer from a high background arising from the coisolation of non-S-acylated proteins. The background can be substantially reduced by an additional blockage of residual free cysteine residues with 2,2'-dithiodipyridine prior to the biotin-HPDP reaction. Coupling the low-background ABE (LB-ABE) method with label-free proteomics, 2 895 high-confidence candidate S-acylated proteins (including 1 591 known S-acylated proteins) were identified from human prostate cancer LNCaP cells, representing so-far the largest S-acylproteome data set identified in a single study. Immunoblotting analysis confirmed the S-acylation of five known and five novel prostate cancer-related S-acylated proteins in LNCaP cells and suggested that their S-acylation levels were about 0.6-1.8%. In summary, the LB-ABE method largely eliminates the coisolation of non-S-acylated proteins and enables deep S-acylproteomic analysis.

Pain scores were measured on a visual analog scale, the operating room time (ORT) was recorded for each biopsy and correlations between the parameters were analysed.  Results:   Pain scores for IB-GB were slightly lower in group B compared with group A (2.0 ± 1.9; 2.4 ± 1.7; p = 0.02). In group A, significantly more targeted biopsy cores were acquired (group B: 5.2 ± 1.1; group A: 5.6 ± 0.8; p < 0.01). ORT was comparable and not significantly different in both groups. There was only a weak correlation between pain scores and ORT in group B (rS = 0.22; p = 0.01), but no correlation between pain scores and the number of biopsy cores or the prostate volume.  Conclusions:   Pain levels are generally low for MRI-guided in-bore biopsy using either PPNB or intrarectal instillation of lidocaine gel. A statistically significant, slightly lower pain score was documented for PPNB and might be preferred when the focus is analgesia. On the other hand, due to the minor difference and easier administration, intrarectal gel instillation seems to be a reasonable practice for standard analgesia for MRI-guided in-bore biopsy.  Key points:   • Pain levels were low for MRI-guided in-bore biopsy using either PPNB or intrarectal instillation of lidocaine gel as analgesic method. • PPNB prior to IB-GB resulted in a slightly lower pain score but required a higher effort. • Intrarectal gel anaesthesia seems to be a reasonable practice for standard analgesia for IB-GB in an outpatient setting.""","""['M Quentin', 'C Arsov', 'T Ullrich', 'B Valentin', 'A Hiester', 'D Blondin', 'P Albers', 'G Antoch', 'L Schimmöller']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Eur Radiol""","""['Comparison of patient comfort between MR-guided in-bore and MRI/ultrasound fusion-guided prostate biopsies within a prospective randomized trial.', 'Combined perianal-intrarectal (PI) lidocaine-prilocaine (LP) cream and lidocaine-ketorolac gel provide better pain relief than combined PI LP cream and periprostatic nerve block during transrectal prostate biopsy.', 'Periprostatic nerve block alone versus combined with perineal pudendal nerve block or intrarectal local anesthesia during transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy: A prospective randomized controlled trial.', 'Addition of intrarectal local analgesia to periprostatic nerve block improves pain control for transrectal ultrasonography-guided prostate biopsy: a systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'A meta-analysis of local anesthesia for transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsy of the prostate.']"""

However, its underlying mechanism requires further elucidation. Methods: A lentiviral expression vector for miR-145-5p was constructed and used to establish a stable cell line (LNCaP) expressing miR-145-5p. The cells were cultured normally and divided into the control group (control), negative control group (negative control), and test group (miR-145-5p). Inhibition of proliferation was measured by a WST-8 assay. The early apoptosis rate of cells was detected by flow cytometry. Clone formation ability was detected by a clone formation inhibition test. Cell invasion and migration capacity was detected by a Transwell assay. The relative expression levels of proteins were detected by western blotting. We constructed a nude mouse model of prostate cancer to observe the effect of miR-145-5p on the growth of transplanted tumors. TargetScan bioinformatics software was used to predict target genes regulated by miR-14-5p. ChIPBase was used to predict transcription factors with binding sites in the upstream promoter region of miR-145-5p. Quantitative reverse transcription PCR was used to detect the relative expression level of genes. A bifluorescence-reporter gene vector was constructed to confirm the regulation of target genes by miR-145-5p. We used 5' rapid amplification of cDNA ends to confirm the transcription start site of miR-145-5p.Chromatin immunoprecipitation technology was used to detect the effect of transcription factors binding to miR-145-5p. Results: The overexpression of miR-145-5p not only inhibited the proliferation, invasion, and migration of LNCaP cells but also promoted their early apoptosis. After overexpressing miR-145-5p, the expression of small ubiquitin-like modifier protein-specific protease 1 (SENP1), and caudal-related homeobox 2 (CDX2) protein was decreased in LNCaP cells. The transcription factor CDX2 bound to the miR-145-5p promoter region and inhibited its transcription. The transcription start site of miR-145-5p was located at a guanine residue 1,408 bp upstream of the stem-loop sequence. Upon overexpression, miR-145-5p could bind to the 3'-untranslated region of SENP1 to inhibit its translation. Conclusion: These results suggested that CDX2 inhibits the expression of miR-145-5p, thereby relieving the inhibitory effect of miR-145-5p on the translation of SENP1 and affecting the invasion and migration of prostate cancer cells.""","""['Jin-Hua He', 'Ze-Ping Han', 'Mao-Xian Zou', 'Meng-Ling He', 'Yu-Guang Li', 'Lei Zheng']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Front Oncol""","""['Corrigendum: CDX2/mir-145-5p/SENP1 Pathways Affect LNCaP Cells Invasion and Migration.', 'Retraction: CDX2/mir-145-5p/SENP1 Pathways Affect LNCaP Cells Invasion and Migration.', 'The CircRNA-ACAP2/Hsa-miR-21-5p/ Tiam1 Regulatory Feedback Circuit Affects the Proliferation, Migration, and Invasion of Colon Cancer SW480 Cells.', 'CDX2 inhibits pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell proliferation via promoting tumor suppressor miR-615-5p.', 'UBE2C, Directly Targeted by miR-548e-5p, Increases the Cellular Growth and Invasive Abilities of Cancer Cells Interacting with the EMT Marker Protein Zinc Finger E-box Binding Homeobox 1/2 in NSCLC.', 'Negative regulation of CDK6 expression by microRNA-126-5p and its influence on the proliferation and invasion of esophageal cancer cells.', 'MiR-873-5p: A Potential Molecular Marker for Cancer Diagnosis and Prognosis.', 'SNHG1/miR-145-5p/KLF5 Axis Participates in Regulating the Proliferation and Migration of Oral Squamous Cell Cancer.', 'Epi-miRNAs: Regulators of the Histone Modification Machinery in Human Cancer.', 'Effect of the circCDR1as/miR-641/XIAP regulatory axis on the proliferation and invasion of the prostate cancer PC-3 cell line.', 'Plasma Exosome-Derived Sentrin SUMO-Specific Protease 1: A Prognostic Biomarker in Patients With Osteosarcoma.', 'The miR-203a Regulatory Network Affects the Proliferation of Chronic Myeloid Leukemia K562 Cells.']"""

Materials and methods:   This retrospective single-center study enrolled two cohorts of 206 and 310 patients in AS. The latter group was submitted to mpMRI and targeted biopsies at recruitment. Kaplan-meier curves quantified progression-free survival (PFS) and Bioptic-PFS (B-PFS: no upgrading or >3 positive cores) in the two cohorts. Cox-regression analyses tested independent predictors of PFS and B-PFS. In patients submitted to radical prostatectomy (RP) after AS, significant cancer (csPCa) was defined as: GS ≥ 4 + 3 and/or pT ≥ 3a and/or pN+ . Logistic-regression analyses predicted csPCa at RP.  Results and limitations:   Median time follow-up and median time of persistence in AS were 46 (24-70) and 36 (23-58) months, respectively. Patients submitted to mpMRI at AS begin, showed greater PFS at 1- (98% vs. 91%), 3- (80% vs. 57%), and 5-years (70% vs. 35%) follow-up, respectively (all p < 0.01). At Cox-regression analysis only confirmatory mpMRI± targeted biopsy (HR: 0.3; 95% CI 0.2-0.5; p < 0.01) at AS begin was an independent predictor of PFS.

Patients submitted to confirmatory mpMRI experienced greater 1-(98% vs. 93%), 3-(90% vs. 75%), and 5-years (83% vs. 56%) B-PFS, respectively (all p < 0.01). At Cox-regression analysis, mpMRI±-targeted biopsy at AS begin was associated with B-PFS (HR: 0.3; 95% CI 0.2-0.6; p < 0.01). No differences were recorded in csPCa rates between the two groups (22% vs. 28%; p = 0.47). Limitations of the study are the single-center retrospective nature and the absence of long-term follow-up.

A retrospective cohort of 2301 eligible patients attending our institution from 2004 to 2015 was reviewed. Patients were divided into two groups based on age at surgery (>70 years [n = 610] vs 70 years [n = 1691]) and four groups by year of surgery. Over the study period, the proportion of patients aged >70 years gradually increased up to 30.0%, and the rate of robot-assisted RP and neurovascular bundle (NVB) saving increased continually to 80.0% and 67.4% of older patients, respectively. Although the rate of recovery of UC within 12 months (3 months) in patients aged >70 years was lower than that in those aged ≤ 70 years (81.5% [52.6%] vs 88.6% [60.9%], respectively; both P < 0.001), the gap between age groups in the rate of recovery within 12 months narrowed from the second quarter of the study period. Among younger patients, age, robot-assisted RP, prostate volume, membranous urethral length (MUL), and NVB saving were predictors of recovery of UC within 3 or 12 months. In contrast, only age and MUL were predictors of recovery of UC within 3 and 12 months in patients aged >70 years.

In this study, we investigated if seminal plasma proteins could increase diagnostic specificity of detecting primary prostate cancer and discriminate between high- and low-grade cancers. To select 147 most promising biomarker candidates, we combined proteins identified through five independent experimental or data mining approaches: tissue transcriptomics, seminal plasma proteomics, cell line secretomics, tissue specificity, and androgen regulation. A rigorous biomarker development pipeline based on selected reaction monitoring assays was designed to evaluate the most promising candidates. As a result, we qualified 76, and verified 19 proteins in seminal plasma of 67 negative biopsy and 152 prostate cancer patients. Verification revealed a prostate-specific, secreted and androgen-regulated protein-glutamine gamma-glutamyltransferase 4 (TGM4), which predicted prostate cancer on biopsy and outperformed age and serum Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA). A machine-learning approach for data analysis provided improved multi-marker combinations for diagnosis and prognosis. In the independent verification set measured by an in-house immunoassay, TGM4 protein was upregulated 3.7-fold (p = 0.006) and revealed AUC = 0.66 for detecting prostate cancer on biopsy for patients with serum PSA ≥4 ng/ml and age ≥50. Very low levels of TGM4 (120 pg/ml) were detected in blood serum. Collectively, our study demonstrated rigorous evaluation of one of the remaining and not well-explored prostate-specific proteins within the medium-abundance proteome of seminal plasma.

Such knowledge of the comorbidities and treatment of LE may assist in diagnostic decisions and health care planning.  Methods:   To determine the proportion of LE patients with various LE-associated comorbidities as well as the rate of associated treatment, deidentified Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act-compliant commercial administrative claims from the Blue Health Intelligence (BHI) research database (165 million Blue Cross Blue Shield members) were queried. We analyzed a BHI study sample of 26,902 patients with LE who had been enrolled with continuous medical benefits for 12 months before and after the index date for the complete years 2012 through 2016. Patients were first identified by comorbidity and then grouped into those receiving no treatment for LE and those receiving any treatment for LE. Any treatment was defined as receiving manual lymphatic drainage, physical therapy, compression garments, or a pneumatic compression device. The purpose of this study was to determine the proportion of LE patients comorbid with various known LE-associated conditions and the treatment rates of LE patients with each comorbidity.  Results:   Among the 84,579,269 BHI patients enrolled during the study window, 81,366 patients were identified with LE. From this LE group, our study focused on the 26,902 patients who were enrolled with continuous medical and pharmacy benefits for 12 months before and after the index date. Among these 26,902 LE patients, breast cancer was the most frequent comorbidity with LE (32.1%), and these patients almost universally received any treatment (94.2%); other cancer types, such as melanoma (2.1%) and prostate cancer (0.7%), were less frequent and received any treatment less often, 75% and 82% of the time, respectively. Venous leg ulcer was the most common non-cancer-linked comorbidity for LE (9.6%), but only 81.7% of venous leg ulcer patients received any treatment for LE.  Conclusions:   To our knowledge, this is the largest study to date detailing the comorbidities associated with LE and LE treatment rates within each. Our findings suggest that a sizable proportion of cancer-related LE patients do not receive appropriate treatment. Furthermore, this study highlights the role of advanced venous disease as an LE comorbidity that is frequently untreated and its associated gap in treatment.""","""['Andrew Son', ""Thomas F O'Donnell Jr"", 'Jessica Izhakoff', 'Julia A Gaebler', 'Timothy Niecko', 'Mark A Iafrati']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""J Vasc Surg Venous Lymphat Disord""","""['Phlebolymphedema is the ultimate comorbidity/outcome of lymphedema.', 'Correlation of disease comorbidity with prescribed treatment among insured U.S. lymphedema patients.', 'Health and economic benefits of advanced pneumatic compression devices in patients with phlebolymphedema.', 'US budget impact of increased payer adoption of the Flexitouch advanced pneumatic compression device in lymphedema patients with advanced chronic venous insufficiency and multiple infections.', 'Manual lymphatic drainage for lymphedema following breast cancer treatment.', 'Approaches to the application and removal of compression therapy: A literature review.', 'Practice points for lymphoedema care in low- and middle- income countries developed by nominal group technique.', 'The Prevalence of Lower Limb and Genital Lymphedema after Prostate Cancer Treatment: A Systematic Review.', 'Exploring disease interrelationships in patients with lymphatic disorders: A single center retrospective experience.', 'Improving care for cancer-related and other forms of lymphoedema in low- and middle-income countries: a qualitative study.', 'The American Venous Forum, American Vein and Lymphatic Society and the Society for Vascular Medicine expert opinion consensus on lymphedema diagnosis and treatment.']"""

Materials and methods:   Archived preoperative transrectal ultrasound images from 100 patients receiving low-dose-rate prostate brachytherapy were used to characterize the prostatic urethra, contoured on ultrasound using aerated gel. Consensus contours, defined using majority vote, described commonalities in cross-sectional shape across patients. Potential simplified surrogates were defined and evaluated against the true urethra. The best performing surrogate, a circle of varying size (CS) was retrospectively contoured on 85 high-dose-rate prostate brachytherapy treatment plans. Dose to this recommended surrogate was compared with urethral doses estimated by the standard 6 mm circle surrogate.  Results:   Clear variation in urethral cross-sectional shape was observed along its length and between patients. The standard circle surrogate had low predictive sensitivity (61.1%) compared with true urethra because of underrepresentation of the verumontanum midgland. The CS best represented the true urethra across all validation metrics (dice: 0.73, precision: 67.0%, sensitivity: 83.2%, conformity: 0.78). Retrospective evaluation of planned doses using the CS surrogate resulted in significant differences in all reported urethral dose parameters compared with the standard circle, with the exception of D100%. The urethral dose limit (115%) was exceeded in 40% of patients for the CS surrogate.  Conclusions:   The proposed CS surrogate, consisting of circles of varying diameter, is simple yet better represents the true urethra compared with the standard 6 mm circle. Higher urethral doses were predicted using CS, and the improved accuracy of CS may offer increased predictive power for urethral toxicity, a subject of future work.""","""['Heather Halperin', 'Michelle Hilts', 'Juanita Crook', 'Deidre Batchelar', 'Steven Tisseverasinghe', 'Audrey Tetreault-LaFlamme', 'Francois Bachand']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Brachytherapy""","""['A novel urethral sparing technique for high-dose-rate prostate brachytherapy after transurethral resection of the prostate.', 'The importance of urethra visualization for preplanned permanent prostate implants.', 'Differences in urethral dosimetry between CT and MR imaging in multichannel vaginal cylinder brachytherapy.', 'Simple diagrammatic method to delineate male urethra in prostate cancer radiotherapy: an MRI based approach.', 'Permanent implant prostate cancer brachytherapy: 2013 state-of-the art.', 'The urethral position may shift due to urethral catheter placement in the treatment planning for prostate radiation therapy.']"""

Methods:   The Liverpool Lung Project (LLP) and the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial (PLCO) were 2 models used to calculate risk of developing lung cancer. Risk was calculated as a function of age for developing lung cancer within the next 5 to 10 years.  Results:   PLCO estimated a peak risk of 16.20% at age 75 for 30-pack-year smokers with a first-degree relative with lung cancer. LLP estimated a peak risk of 7.3% over the next 5 years at age 79 for men with 30-pack-year and a first-degree relative with early-onset lung cancer (<60 years). Female never smokers with cumulative variables other than smoking had a peak risk of 3.40% for age 74 to 75 years. In contrast, women with only 30-pack-year smoking history and no other variable had a peak risk of 2.20% at age 74 to 75 years.

Methods:   The 45 and Up cohort (n ≈267,000) was linked to NSW Cancer Register (NSWCR), Emergency Department Data Collection (EDDC) and Medical Benefits Schedule (MBS) data using probabilistic record linkage. First-ever malignant cancers diagnosed after enrolment in the 45 and Up study comprised the study cases. Where possible, five controls were randomly selected per case from the 45 and Up cohort, matched by sex and year of birth. Controls comprised those with no cancer recorded on the NSWCR. For each month in the year preceding and following the cancer diagnosis, general practitioner, specialist and specified hospital ED service use was compared between cases and controls using proportions, means, and odds ratios derived from conditional logistic regression.  Results:   Compared to controls, cases of all cancers combined had a significantly higher likelihood of GP and specialist consultation in the year leading up to diagnosis. This was most pronounced in the 3-4 months leading up diagnosis for all cancers, similarly for lung cancer (GPs and specialists) and melanoma (GPs), and colorectal cancer (specialists). Likelihood of a GP consultation remained significantly higher in cases than controls in the 12 months following diagnosis. During most of the year preceding cancer diagnosis, the likelihood of specified ED presentations was also significantly higher in cases than controls for all cancers, and most pronounced in the 2-3 months before diagnosis. Excepting melanoma, the likelihood of specified ED presentations remained significantly elevated for most of the year following diagnosis for all cancers combined and for the selected cancers.  Conclusions:   People with cancer experience a higher use of primary and secondary healthcare services in the year preceding and following diagnosis, with GPs continuing to play a significant role post diagnosis. The higher likelihood of pre-diagnosis GP consultations among cancer cases requires further investigation, including whether signals might be derived to alert GPs to possibilities for earlier cancer detection.""","""['Stephen Morrell', 'Jane Young', 'David Roder']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""BMC Health Serv Res""","""['Identifying incident colorectal and lung cancer cases in health service utilisation databases in Australia: a validation study.', 'Self-selection in a population-based cohort study: impact on health service use and survival for bowel and lung cancer assessed using data linkage.', 'Impact Evaluation of a System-Wide Chronic Disease Management Program on Health Service Utilisation: A Propensity-Matched Cohort Study.', 'Screening for Skin Cancer in Adults: An Updated Systematic Evidence Review for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force Internet.', 'Diagnosis of cancer as an emergency: a critical review of current evidence.', 'Healthcare use in the year preceding a diagnosis of pancreatic cancer: a register-based cohort study in Denmark.', 'Contacts to general practice in the 12 months preceding a diagnosis of an abdominal cancer: a national register-based cohort study.', 'Effect of prior malignancy on the prognosis of gastric cancer and somatic mutation.', 'Does changing healthcare use signal opportunities for earlier detection of cancer?

In this study, we have induced EMT of in vitro prostate (PCa) and breast cancer (BCa) cell lines by treatment of transforming growth factor β 1 (TGFβ1), a pleiotropic cytokine with transition-regulating activities. We found that the TGFβ1-treated, post-EMT cells exhibited up to a 45% reduction in binding affinity to antibodies against EpCAM (aEpCAM). To overcome this limitation, we designed our capture platform that integrates a unique combination of biomimetic cell rolling, dendrimer-mediated multivalent binding, and antibody cocktails of aEpCAM/aEGFR/aHER-2. Our capture surfaces resulted in up to 98% capture efficiency of post-EMT cells from mixtures of TGFβ1-treated and untreated cancer cells spiked in culture media and human blood.

Here, we explore how the generation of a novel freehand fluorescence (fhFluo) imaging approach complements freehand SPECT (fhSPECT) in a hybrid setup. Near-infrared optical tracking was used to register the position and the orientation of a hybrid opto-nuclear detection probe while recording its readings. Dedicated look-up table models were used for 3D reconstruction. In phantom and excised tissue settings (i.e., flat-surface human skin explants), fhSPECT and fhFluo were investigated for image resolution and in-tissue signal penetration. Finally, the combined potential of these freehand technologies was evaluated on prostate and lymph node specimens of prostate cancer patients receiving prostatectomy and sentinel lymph node dissection (tracers: indocyanine green (ICG) +99m Tc-nanocolloid or ICG-99mTc-nanocolloid). After hardware and software integration, the hybrid setup created 3D nuclear and fluorescence tomography scans. The imaging resolution of fhFluo (1 mm) was superior to that of fhSPECT (6 mm). Fluorescence modalities were confined to a maximum depth of 0.5 cm, while nuclear modalities were usable at all evaluated depths (<2 cm). Both fhSPECT and fhFluo enabled augmented- and virtual-reality navigation toward segmented image hotspots, including relative hotspot quantification with an accuracy of 3.9% and 4.1%. Imaging in surgical specimens confirmed these trends (fhSPECT: in-depth detectability, low resolution, and fhFluo: superior resolution, superficial detectability). Overall, when radioactive and fluorescent tracer signatures are used, fhFluo has complementary value to fhSPECT. Combined the freehand technologies render a unique hybrid imaging and navigation modality.""","""['Matthias N van Oosterom', 'Philippa Meershoek', 'Mick M Welling', 'Francisco Pinto', 'Philipp Matthies', 'Herve Simon', 'Thomas Wendler', 'Nassir Navab', 'Cornelis J H van de Velde', 'Henk G van der Poel', 'Fijs W B van Leeuwen']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""IEEE Trans Med Imaging""","""['Advancing intraoperative magnetic tracing using 3D freehand magnetic particle imaging.', 'Multispectral Fluorescence Imaging During Robot-assisted Laparoscopic Sentinel Node Biopsy: A First Step Towards a Fluorescence-based Anatomic Roadmap.', 'Can Intraoperative Fluorescence Imaging Identify All Lesions While the Road Map Created by Preoperative Nuclear Imaging Is Masked?', '3D scintigraphic imaging and navigation in radioguided surgery: freehand SPECT technology and its clinical applications.', 'The GOSTT concept and hybrid mixed/virtual/augmented reality environment radioguided surgery.', 'Quantitative tumor depth determination using dual wavelength excitation fluorescence.', 'The application of indocyanine green in guiding prostate cancer treatment.', 'The current status and future prospects for molecular imaging-guided precision surgery.', 'Correntropy-induced metric with Laplacian kernel for robust fluorescence molecular tomography.', 'Advancing intraoperative magnetic tracing using 3D freehand magnetic particle imaging.']"""

Summary answer:   We identified a core group of 113 long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) and 20 novel genes dynamically and syntenically transcribed during spermatogenesis.  What is known already:   Spermatogenesis is a complex differentiation process driven by a tightly regulated and highly specific gene expression program. Recently, several studies in various species have established that a large proportion of known lncRNAs are preferentially expressed during meiosis and spermiogenesis in a testis-specific manner.  Study design, size, duration:   To further investigate lncRNA expression in human spermatogenesis, we carried out a cross-species RNA profiling study using isolated testicular cells.  Participants/materials, setting, methods:   Human testes were obtained from post-mortem donors (N = 8, 51 years old on average) or from prostate cancer patients with no hormonal treatment (N = 9, 80 years old on average) and only patients with full spermatogenesis were used to prepare enriched populations of spermatocytes, spermatids, Leydig cells, peritubular cells and Sertoli cells. To minimize potential biases linked to inter-patient variations, RNAs from two or three donors were pooled prior to RNA-sequencing (paired-end, strand-specific). Resulting reads were mapped to the human genome, allowing for assembly and quantification of corresponding transcripts.  Main results and the role of chance:   Our RNA-sequencing analysis of pools of isolated human testicular cells enabled us to reconstruct over 25 000 transcripts. Among them we identified thousands of lncRNAs, as well as many previously unidentified genes (novel unannotated transcripts) that share many properties of lncRNAs. Of note is that although noncoding genes showed much lower synteny than protein-coding ones, a significant fraction of syntenic lncRNAs displayed conserved expression during spermatogenesis.  Large scale data:   Raw data files (fastq) and a searchable table (.xlss) containing information on genomic features and expression data for all refined transcripts have been submitted to the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus under accession number GSE74896.  Limitations, reasons for caution:   Isolation procedures may alter the physiological state of testicular cells, especially for somatic cells, leading to substantial changes at the transcriptome level. We therefore cross-validated our findings with three previously published transcriptomic analyses of human spermatogenesis. Despite the use of stringent filtration criteria, i.e. expression cut-off of at least three fragments per kilobase of exon model per million reads mapped, fold-change of at least three and false discovery rate adjusted P-values of less than <1%, the possibility of assembly artifacts and false-positive transcripts cannot be fully ruled out.  Wider implications of the findings:   For the first time, this study has led to the identification of a large number of conserved germline-associated lncRNAs that are potentially important for spermatogenesis and sexual reproduction. In addition to further substantiating the basis of the human testicular physiology, our study provides new candidate genes for male infertility of genetic origin. This is likely to be relevant for identifying interesting diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers and also potential novel therapeutic targets for male contraception.

Materials and methods:   Included in study were 478 consecutive patients with prebiopsy positive multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging and a greater than 10-core systematic biopsy combined with fusion targeted biopsy who underwent radical prostatectomy. The primary end point was the grade group concordance between biopsy and radical prostatectomy pathology according to the biopsy technique. Clinical and biological factors associated with the performance of systematic biopsy were analyzed.  Results:   Adding systematic biopsy to targeted biopsy modified the d'Amico risk classification toward more intermediate and high risk in 7.8% of cases, mainly from low to intermediate risk with low risk prostate cancer on targeted biopsy in 44.3%. This reclassification was significantly higher in patients with lower prostate specific antigen and with prostate specific antigen density less than 0.20 ng/ml/gm (11.7% vs 2.4%, p <0.001). The concordance rate between biopsy pathology and radical prostatectomy pathology significantly differed between targeted biopsy and targeted biopsy plus systematic biopsy (45.2% and 51.7%, respectively). The upgrading rate in radical prostatectomy specimens decreased by 22% when systematic biopsy was added to targeted biopsy. Patients in whom systematic biopsy did not modify grading were more likely to have pT3-4 and/or pN1 disease on final pathology (56.9% vs 38.3%, p=0.007).  Conclusions:   Grading concordance between biopsy pathology and radical prostatectomy pathology was improved by adding systematic biopsy in all patient subgroups. Patients with prostate specific antigen density less than 0.20 ng/ml/gm benefited the most from this combined biopsy strategy. Systematic biopsy reclassified a nonnegligible number of cases toward a higher risk category, mainly the low risk cases.

Advances in precision medicine have shifted the research focus toward underlying genetic differences. However, nonbiological factors may have a large role in these observed disparities. Therefore, we sought to measure the relative importance of race compared to health care and social factors on prostate cancer specific mortality.  Materials and methods:   Using the SEER (Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results) database we identified 514,878 men diagnosed with prostate cancer at age 40 years or greater between 2004 and 2012. We also selected a subset of black and white men matched by age, stage and birth year. We stratified patients by age 40 to 54, 55 to 69 and 70 years or older and disease stage, resulting in 18 groups. By applying random forest methods with variable importance measures we analyzed 15 variables and interactions across 4 categories of factors (tumor characteristics, race, and health care and social factors) and the relative importance for prostate cancer specific mortality.  Results:   Tumor characteristics at diagnosis were the most important factors for prostate cancer mortality. Across all groups race was less than 5% as important as tumor characteristics and only more important than health care and social factors in 2 of the 18 groups. Although race had a significant impact, health care and social factors known to be associated with racial disparities had greater or similarly important effects across all ages and stages.  Conclusions:   Eradicating disparities in prostate cancer survival will require a multipronged approach, including advances in precision medicine.

We determined the diagnostic performance of B-mode, shear wave elastography and contrast enhanced ultrasound with quantification software as well as the combination, multiparametric ultrasound, for clinically significant prostate cancer localization using radical prostatectomy histopathology as the reference standard.  Materials and methods:   From May 2017 to July 2017, 50 men with biopsy proven prostate cancer underwent multiparametric ultrasound before radical prostatectomy at 1 center. Three readers independently evaluated 12 anatomical regions of interest for the likelihood of clinically significant prostate cancer on a 5-point Likert scale for all separate ultrasound modalities and multiparametric ultrasound. A logistic linear mixed model was used to estimate diagnostic performance for the localization of clinically significant prostate cancer (any tumor with Gleason score 3 + 4 = 7 or greater, tumor volume 0.5 ml or greater, extraprostatic extension or stage pN1) using a Likert score of 3 or greater and 4 or greater as the threshold. To detect the index lesion the readers selected the 2 most suspicious regions of interest.  Results:   A total of 48 men were included in the final analysis. The region of interest specific sensitivity of multiparametric ultrasound (Likert 3 or greater) for clinically significant prostate cancer was 74% (95% CI 67-80) compared to 55% (95% CI 47-63), 55% (95% CI 47-63) and 59% (95% CI 51-67) for B-mode, shear wave elastography and contrast enhanced ultrasound, respectively. Multiparametric ultrasound sensitivity was significantly higher for Likert thresholds and all different clinically significant prostate cancer definitions (all p <0.05). Multiparametric ultrasound improved the detection of index lesion prostate cancer.

As photon-upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) can be detected without optical background interference, they are excellent labels for so-called single-molecule upconversion-linked immunosorbent assays (ULISAs). We have introduced a UCNP label design based on streptavidin-PEG-neridronate and a two-step detection scheme involving a biotinylated antibody that efficiently reduces nonspecific binding on microtiter plates. In a microtiter plate immunoassay, individual sandwich immune complexes of the cancer marker prostate-specific antigen (PSA) are detected and counted by wide-field epiluminescence microscopy (digital readout). The digital detection is 16× more sensitive than the respective analogue readout and thus expands the limit of detection to the sub-femtomolar concentration range (LOD: 23 fg mL-1, 800 aM). The single molecule ULISA shows excellent correlation with an electrochemiluminescence reference method. Although the analogue readout can routinely measure PSA concentrations in human serum samples, very low concentrations have to be monitored after radical prostatectomy.

These priorities are critical for prostate cancer survivors because men rarely seek mental health care. However, little is known about the epidemiology of depression in this patient population. The goal of this study was to describe the prevalence and predictors of probable depression in prostate cancer survivors.  Methods:   The data were from a population-based cohort of North Carolinian prostate cancer survivors who were enrolled from 2004 to 2007 in the North Carolina-Louisiana Prostate Cancer Project (n = 1031) and were prospectively followed annually from 2008 to 2011 in the Health Care Access and Prostate Cancer Treatment in North Carolina study (n = 805). Generalized estimating equations were used to evaluate an indicator of probable depression (Short Form 12 mental composite score ≤48.9; measured at enrollment and during the annual follow-up) as a function of individual-level characteristics within the longitudinal data set.  Results:   The prevalence of probable depression fell from 38% in the year of the cancer diagnosis to 20% 6 to 7 years later. Risk factors for probable depression throughout the study were African American race, unemployment, low annual income, younger age, recency of cancer diagnosis, past depression, comorbidities, treatment decisional regret, and nonadherence to exercise recommendations.

In total, 15 patients with biopsy-confirmed localized prostate cancers were recruited. Cardiac MRI (CMRI) and ultrafast DCE-MRI were acquired on a Philips 3 T Ingenia scanner. The AIF was measured at iliac arties following injection of a low-dose (0.015 mmol/kg) gadolinium (Gd) contrast media. The cardiac output (CO) from CMRI (COCMRI) was calculated from the difference in ventricular volume at diastole and systole measured on the short axis of heart. The CO from DCE-MRI (CODCE) was also calculated from the AIF and dose of the contrast media used. A correlation test and Bland-Altman plot were used to compare COCMRI and CODCE. The average (±standard deviation [SD]) area under the curve measured directly from local AIF was 0.219 ± 0.07 mM·min. The average (±SD) COCMRI and CODCE were 6.52 ± 1.47 L/min and 6.88 ± 1.64 L/min, respectively. There was a strong positive correlation (r = 0.82, P < .01) and good agreement between COCMRI and CODCE.

To improve the outcome after surgical resection of the tumor, the theranostic multimodal anti-PSMA targeting agent 111In-DTPA-D2B-IRDye700DX was developed and characterized for both pre- and intra-operative tumor localization and eradication of (residual) tumor tissue by PSMA-targeted photodynamic therapy (tPDT), which is a highly selective cancer treatment based on targeting molecules conjugated to photosensitizers that can induce cell destruction upon exposure to near-infrared (NIR) light. Methods: The anti-PSMA monoclonal antibody D2B was conjugated with IRDye700DX and DTPA and subsequently radiolabeled with 111In. To determine the optimal dose and time point for tPDT, BALB/c nude mice with PSMA-expressing (PSMA+) s.c. LS174T-PSMA xenografts received the conjugate (24-240 µg/mouse) intravenously (8 MBq/mouse) followed by µSPECT/CT, near-infrared fluorescence imaging, and ex vivo biodistribution at 24, 48, 72 and 168 h p.i. Tumor growth of LS174T-PSMA xenografts and overall survival of mice treated with 1-3 times of NIR light irradiation (50, 100, 150 J/cm2) 24 h after injection of 80 µg of DTPA-D2B-IRDye700DX was compared to control conditions. Results: Highest specific tumor uptake was observed at conjugate doses of 80 µg/mouse. Biodistribution revealed no significant difference in tumor uptake in mice at 24, 48, 72 and 168 h p.i. PSMA+ tumors were clearly visualized with both µSPECT/CT and NIR fluorescence imaging. Overall survival in mice treated with 80 µg of DTPA-D2B-IRDye700DX and 1x 150 J/cm2 of NIR light at 24 h p.i. was significantly improved compared to the control group receiving neither conjugate nor NIR light (73 days vs. 16 days, respectively, p=0.0453). Treatment with 3x 150 J/cm2 resulted in significantly prolonged survival compared to treatment with 3x 100 J/cm2 (p = 0.0067) and 3x 50 J/cm2 (p = 0.0338). Principal conclusions:111In-DTPA-D2B-IRDye700DX can be used for pre- and intra-operative detection of PSMA+ tumors with radionuclide and NIR fluorescence imaging and PSMA-targeted PDT.

PLK1 is aberrantly expressed in many types of tumor cells and increased levels of PLK1 are closely related to tumorigenesis and poor clinical outcomes. Therefore, PLK1 is accepted as one of the potential targets for the discovery of novel anticancer agents. The objective of this study was to assess the cytotoxic effects of a novel PLK1 inhibitor, RO3280, against MCF-7, human breast cancer cells; HepG2, human hepatocellular carcinoma cells; and PC3, human prostate cancer cells, as well as non-cancerous L929 fibroblast cells.  Methods:   Antiproliferative activity of RO3280 was examined using the XTT assay. Flow cytometry assay was performed to evaluate cell cycle distribution, apoptosis, multicaspase activity, mitochondrial membrane potential, and DNA damage response. Apoptosis with fluorescence imaging studies was also examined.  Results:   According to the results of XTT assay, although RO3280 displayed potent cytotoxicity in all treated cancer cells, the most sensitive cell line was identified as MCF-7 cells that were selected for further studies. The compound induced a cell cycle arrest in MCF-7 cells at G2/M phase and significantly induced apoptosis, multicaspase activity, DNA damage response, and decreased mitochondrial membrane potential of MCF-7 cells.

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common cancers globally. We aim to determine the uptake rate, barriers and predictors of CRC screening among cancer survivors. Methods: Within a public hospital in Singapore, 150 non-CRC survivors were enrolled. Questionnaire on knowledge, screening behaviour, motivators and barriers towards CRC screening was administered. Results: Majority were survivors of breast (69.3%), prostate (7.3%), endometrial (4%) and ovarian (4%) cancers. More than half had high knowledge scores for CRC symptoms, screening tests and risk factors. About a third had received physician’s recommendation on CRC screening. Approximately half had undergone screening. The most common barriers to CRC screening were lack of symptoms and physician’s recommendation.

Reduced renal function is associated with an increased risk of cancer, but the cancer incidence and sites in dialysis patients compared with those of the general population require further investigation. We investigated the incidences of various cancers in dialysis patients in Korea and used national health insurance data to identify cancers that should be screened in dialysis clinics.  Methods:   We accessed the Korean National Health Insurance Database and excerpted data using the International Classification of Disease codes for dialysis and malignancies. We included all patients who commenced dialysis between 2004 and 2013 and selected the same number of controls via propensity score matching.  Results:   A total of 48,315 dialysis patients and controls were evaluated; of these, 2,504 (5.2%) dialysis patients and 2,201 (4.6%) controls developed cancer. The overall cancer risk was 1.54-fold higher in dialysis patients than in controls (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.71; 95% confidence interval, 1.61-1.81). The cancer incidence rate (incidence rate ratio [IRR], 3.27) was especially high in younger dialysis patients (aged 0-29 years). The most common malignancy of end-stage renal disease patients and controls was colorectal cancer. The major primary cancer sites in dialysis patients were liver and stomach, followed by the lung, kidney, and urinary tract. Kidney cancer exhibited the highest IRR (6.75), followed by upper urinary tract (4.00) and skin cancer (3.38). The rates of prostate cancer (0.54) and oropharyngeal cancer (0.72) were lower than those in the general population.

Methods:   PCa patients were recruited at diagnosis prior to treatment decision-making and completed questionnaires assessing anxiety (State-Trait Anxiety Inventory short form [STAI-6] and Memorial Anxiety Scale for Prostate Cancer [MAX-PC]) and depression symptoms (Centre for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale [CES-D]) at four timepoints for 9 months. Non-cancer controls were recruited via university staff lists and community groups. Results were analyzed using analysis of variance.  Results:   Fifty-four PCa (AS n = 11, AT n = 43) and 53 non-cancer participants were recruited. The main effect of time or treatment group were not statistically significant for CES-D scores (P > .05). The main effect of treatment on STAI-6 scores was significant (F2,73 = 4.678, .012) with AS patients reporting highest STAI-6 scores (T1 M = 36.56; T2 M = 36.89, T3 M = 38.46; T4 M = 38.89).

The aim of the present study was to explore patient experience of participating in a nutrition intervention in a randomised controlled trial, with a focus on facilitators and barriers to adherence.  Methods:   Semistructured interviews were conducted with 15 men with prostate cancer recruited from a randomised controlled trial on a nutrition intervention during radiotherapy. Interviews were analysed with content analysis with an inductive approach.  Results:   The informants were motivated to make dietary changes to avoid bowel symptoms. Social support, a feeling of contributing to the greater good, prior knowledge, dietary information and a small need for behaviour change facilitated adherence. Feeling limited, wanting to decide for themselves, the timing of the intervention, unmet expectations of dietary advice and loss of motivation, were described as barriers for adherence.  Conclusions:   Future nutrition intervention trials may benefit from involving significant others to a greater degree, as well as offering pre-set recipes and strategies to manage social events, and more sessions with the dietitian for patients in need of more support.

The relationships between SSEA-4 expression in cancer cells or the presence of SSEA-4-positive tumor-infiltrating immune cells (TICs) and clinicopathological parameters were analyzed. SSEA-4 expression in cancer cells was significantly associated with Gleason score, local progression, and lymph node and distant metastasis.

In contrast, combination of high SSEA-4 expression in cancer cells and the presence of SSEA-4-positive TICs was an independent predictor for pT3 and BCR in multivariate analysis.

FOXA1 is frequently mutated in hormone-receptor-driven prostate, breast, bladder and salivary-gland tumours3-8. However, it is unclear how FOXA1 alterations affect the development of cancer, and FOXA1 has previously been ascribed both tumour-suppressive9-11 and oncogenic12-14 roles. Here we assemble an aggregate cohort of 1,546 prostate cancers and show that FOXA1 alterations fall into three structural classes that diverge in clinical incidence and genetic co-alteration profiles, with a collective prevalence of 35%. Class-1 activating mutations originate in early prostate cancer without alterations in ETS or SPOP, selectively recur within the wing-2 region of the DNA-binding forkhead domain, enable enhanced chromatin mobility and binding frequency, and strongly transactivate a luminal androgen-receptor program of prostate oncogenesis. By contrast, class-2 activating mutations are acquired in metastatic prostate cancers, truncate the C-terminal domain of FOXA1, enable dominant chromatin binding by increasing DNA affinity and-through TLE3 inactivation-promote metastasis driven by the WNT pathway. Finally, class-3 genomic rearrangements are enriched in metastatic prostate cancers, consist of duplications and translocations within the FOXA1 locus, and structurally reposition a conserved regulatory element-herein denoted FOXA1 mastermind (FOXMIND)-to drive overexpression of FOXA1 or other oncogenes. Our study reaffirms the central role of FOXA1 in mediating oncogenesis driven by the androgen receptor, and provides mechanistic insights into how the classes of FOXA1 alteration promote the initiation and/or metastatic progression of prostate cancer. These results have direct implications for understanding the pathobiology of other hormone-receptor-driven cancers and rationalize the co-targeting of FOXA1 activity in therapeutic strategies.""","""['Abhijit Parolia#', 'Marcin Cieslik#', 'Shih-Chun Chu', 'Lanbo Xiao', 'Takahiro Ouchi', 'Yuping Zhang', 'Xiaoju Wang', 'Pankaj Vats', 'Xuhong Cao', 'Sethuramasundaram Pitchiaya', 'Fengyun Su', 'Rui Wang', 'Felix Y Feng', 'Yi-Mi Wu', 'Robert J Lonigro', 'Dan R Robinson', 'Arul M Chinnaiyan']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Nature""","""['The Sly Oncogene: FOXA1 Mutations in Prostate Cancer.', 'Re: Distinct Structural Classes of Activating FOXA1 Alterations in Advanced Prostate Cancer.', 'Pioneer of prostate cancer: past, present and the future of FOXA1.', 'FOXA1 mutations alter pioneering activity, differentiation and prostate cancer phenotypes.', 'Androgen receptor-independent function of FoxA1 in prostate cancer metastasis.', 'Chromatin binding of FOXA1 is promoted by LSD1-mediated demethylation in prostate cancer.', 'FOXA1: a transcription factor with parallel functions in development and cancer.', 'Cellular specificity of androgen receptor, coregulators, and pioneer factors in prostate cancer.', 'Regulatory genes in the androgen production, uptake and conversion (APUC) pathway in advanced prostate cancer.', 'FOXA1-induced LINC00621 promotes lung adenocarcinoma progression via activating the TGF-β signaling pathway.', 'TRAF4-mediated nonproteolytic ubiquitination of androgen receptor promotes castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Epigenomic mapping identifies an enhancer repertoire that regulates cell identity in bladder cancer through distinct transcription factor networks.']"""

Here, by annotating the landscape of FOXA1 mutations from 3,086 human prostate cancers, we define two hotspots in the forkhead domain: Wing2 (around 50% of all mutations) and the highly conserved DNA-contact residue R219 (around 5% of all mutations). Wing2 mutations are detected in adenocarcinomas at all stages, whereas R219 mutations are enriched in metastatic tumours with neuroendocrine histology. Interrogation of the biological properties of wild-type FOXA1 and fourteen FOXA1 mutants reveals gain of function in mouse prostate organoid proliferation assays. Twelve of these mutants, as well as wild-type FOXA1, promoted an exaggerated pro-luminal differentiation program, whereas two different R219 mutants blocked luminal differentiation and activated a mesenchymal and neuroendocrine transcriptional program. Assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing (ATAC-seq) of wild-type FOXA1 and representative Wing2 and R219 mutants revealed marked, mutant-specific changes in open chromatin at thousands of genomic loci and exposed sites of FOXA1 binding and associated increases in gene expression. Of note, ATAC-seq peaks in cells expressing R219 mutants lacked the canonical core FOXA1-binding motifs (GTAAAC/T) but were enriched for a related, non-canonical motif (GTAAAG/A), which was preferentially activated by R219-mutant FOXA1 in reporter assays.

Methods:   The pooled analysis included 1,062 patients from four institutions (Martini Clinic, Durham VA Medical Center, Intermountain Healthcare, Ochsner Clinic) treated definitively for localized prostate cancer by either radical prostatectomy or radiotherapy (brachytherapy or external beam radiotherapy ± hormone therapy). The CCP score was determined using the RNA expression of 46 genes from archival formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded biopsy tissue. The CCR score was calculated using a predefined linear combination of the CCP score and the Cancer of the Prostate Risk Assessment (CAPRA) score. The scores were evaluated for association with 10-year risk of metastatic disease following definitive therapy after adjusting for other clinical variables.  Results:   The CCP score was strongly associated with 10-year risk of metastatic disease in multivariable analysis [Hazard Ratio per unit score = 2.21; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.64, 2.98; p = 1.9 × 10-6] after adjusting for CAPRA, treatment type, and cohort.

This AR activity occurs through a variety of mechanisms, including up-regulation of AR coactivators such as VAV3 and expression of constitutively active AR variants such as the clinically relevant AR-V7. AR-V7 lacks a ligand-binding domain and is linked to poor prognosis. We previously showed that VAV3 enhances AR-V7 activity to drive CRPC progression. Gene expression profiling after depletion of either VAV3 or AR-V7 in CRPC cells revealed arginine vasopressin receptor 1a (AVPR1A) as the most commonly down-regulated gene, indicating that this G protein-coupled receptor may be critical for CRPC. Analysis of publicly available human PC datasets showed that AVPR1A has a higher copy number and increased amounts of mRNA in advanced PC. Depletion of AVPR1A in CRPC cells resulted in decreased cell proliferation and reduced cyclin A. In contrast, androgen-dependent PC, AR-negative PC, or nontumorigenic prostate epithelial cells, which have undetectable AVPR1A mRNA, were minimally affected by AVPR1A depletion. Ectopic expression of AVPR1A in androgen-dependent PC cells conferred castration resistance in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, treatment of CRPC cells with the AVPR1A ligand, arginine vasopressin (AVP), activated ERK and CREB, known promoters of PC progression. A clinically safe and selective AVPR1A antagonist, relcovaptan, prevented CRPC emergence and decreased CRPC orthotopic and bone metastatic growth in mouse models. Based on these preclinical findings, repurposing AVPR1A antagonists is a promising therapeutic approach for CRPC.""","""['Ning Zhao', 'Stephanie O Peacock', 'Chen Hao Lo', 'Laine M Heidman', 'Meghan A Rice', 'Cale D Fahrenholtz', 'Ann M Greene', 'Fiorella Magani', 'Valeria A Copello', 'Maria Julia Martinez', 'Yushan Zhang', 'Yehia Daaka', 'Conor C Lynch', 'Kerry L Burnstein']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Sci Transl Med""","""['AVPR1A: a target in CRPC?', 'Commentary: Arginine vasopressin receptor 1a is a therapeutic target for castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Exploiting Dependence of Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer on the Arginine Vasopressin Signaling Axis by Repurposing Vaptans.', 'Targeting AR Variant-Coactivator Interactions to Exploit Prostate Cancer Vulnerabilities.', 'Vav3 enhances androgen receptor splice variant activity and is critical for castration-resistant prostate cancer growth and survival.', 'Androgen receptor-dependent and -independent mechanisms driving prostate cancer progression: Opportunities for therapeutic targeting from multiple angles.', 'Androgen receptor targeting drugs in castration-resistant prostate cancer and mechanisms of resistance.', 'Effect of remdesivir post-exposure prophylaxis and treatment on pathogenesis of measles in rhesus macaques.', 'The circadian clock in the piriform cortex intrinsically tunes daily changes of odor-evoked neural activity.', 'Hyponatremia and Cancer: From Bedside to Benchside.', 'Harnessing transcriptionally driven chromosomal instability adaptation to target therapy-refractory lethal prostate cancer.', 'Androgen Receptor Signaling Inhibition in Advanced Castration Resistance Prostate Cancer: What Is Expected for the Near Future?']"""

The aim of this study was to identify new biomarkers using mutated peptides for the prognosis and prediction of advanced PCa, based on proteogenomics.  Materials and methods:   The tryptic peptides were analyzed by tandem mass tag-based quantitative proteomics. Proteogenomics were used to identify mutant peptides as novel biomarkers in advanced PCa.  Results:   Using a human database, increased levels of INTS7 and decreased levels of SH3BGRL were found to be associated with the aggressiveness of PCa. Using proteogenomics and a cancer mutation database, 70 mutant peptides were identified in PCa cell lines. Using parallel reaction monitoring, the expression of seven mutant peptides was found to be altered in tumors, amongst which CAPN2 D22E was the most significantly up-regulated mutant peptide in PCa tissues.  Conclusion:   Altered mutant peptides present in PCa tissue could be used as new biomarkers in advanced PCa.""","""['Oh Kwang Kwon', 'Yun-Sok Ha', 'Jun Nyung Lee', 'Sunjoo Kim', 'Hyesuk Lee', 'So Young Chun', 'Tae Gyun Kwon', 'Sangkyu Lee']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Cancer Genomics Proteomics""","""['Comparative Secretome Profiling and Mutant Protein Identification in Metastatic Prostate Cancer Cells by Quantitative Mass Spectrometry-based Proteomics.', 'Mutant Proteogenomics.', 'Identification of Novel Prognosis and Prediction Markers in Advanced Prostate Cancer Tissues Based on Quantitative Proteomics.', 'The Proteome of Primary Prostate Cancer.', 'Current Challenges and Implications of Proteogenomic Approaches in Prostate Cancer.', 'Prognostic implication of heterogeneity and trajectory progression induced by enzalutamide in prostate cancer.', 'Prostate cancer in omics era.', 'From Omics to Multi-Omics Approaches for In-Depth Analysis of the Molecular Mechanisms of Prostate Cancer.', 'Application of Proteogenomics to Urine Analysis towards the Identification of Novel Biomarkers of Prostate Cancer: An Exploratory Study.', 'Improving the detection of aggressive prostate cancer using immunohistochemical staining of protein marker panels.']"""

Also, analyses of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in VDR revealed ethnicity-associated polymorphisms. The aim of this study was to identify VDR SNPs in African American men with and without prostate cancer.  Materials and methods:   The entire VDR gene was screened for germline mutations in a case-control study by denaturing high performance liquid chromatography and DNA sequencing. Logistic regression was used to estimate the association of SNPs, age, family history, and Gleason score with prostate cancer risk.  Results:   Six SNPs in the non-coding regions, and one SNP in the coding region, were detected. SNP 1 (c.278-69G>A) and SNP 4 (c.907+75C>T) have not been previously reported. SNP 4 had a significant protective effect (β=-0.6, p<0.05); whereas, SNP 7 (rs7975232) showed an increase association with prostate cancer risk and high Gleason score (β=0.32, p<0.05). SNP 4, SNP 7 and age were better predictors of prostate cancer risk than family history with a high degree of sensitivity (74.7%) and specificity (92.4%).

PSMA-expression in ganglia has been regarded as an important pitfall in prostate carcinoma-PET diagnostics but has not found any practical use for diagnosis or therapy.  Methods:   We explored this phenomenon and demonstrated the applicability of peripheral ganglia in healthy rats as surrogates for small PSMA positive lesions for the preclinical evaluation of diagnostic PCa PET probes. Healthy rats were measured with PET/CT using the tracers [18F]DCFPyL, [Al18F]PSMA-11 and [68Ga]PSMA-11. Sections of ganglia were stained with an anti-PSMA antibody. [18F]DCFPyL uptake in ganglia was compared to that in LNCaP tumor xenografts in mice.  Results:   Whereas [18F]DCFPyL and [68Ga]PSMA-11 were stable in vivo and accumulated in peripheral ganglia, [Al18F]PSMA-11 suffered from fast in vivo deflourination resulting in high bone uptake. Ganglionic PSMA expression was confirmed by immunohistochemistry. [18F]DCFPyL uptake and signal-to-noise ratio in the superior cervical ganglion was not significantly different from LNCaP xenografts.  Conclusions:   Our results demonstrated the non-inferiority of the novel model compared to conventionally used tumor xenografts in immune compromised rodents with regard to reproducibility and stability of the PSMA signal. Furthermore, the model involves less expense and efforts while it is permanently available and avoids tumor-growth associated animal morbidity and distress. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first tumor-free model suitable for the in vivo evaluation of tumor imaging agents.""","""['Heike Endepols', 'Agnieszka Morgenroth', 'Boris D Zlatopolskiy', 'Philipp Krapf', 'Johannes Zischler', 'Raphael Richarz', 'Sergio Muñoz Vásquez', 'Bernd Neumaier', 'Felix M Mottaghy']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""BMC Cancer""","""['Patterns of uptake of prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA)-targeted 18F-DCFPyL in peripheral ganglia.', '2-(3-{1-Carboxy-5-(6-18Ffluoro-pyridine-3-carbonyl)-amino-pentyl}-ureido)-pentanedioic acid, 18FDCFPyL, a PSMA-based PET imaging agent for prostate cancer.', 'Prospective Comparison of PET Imaging with PSMA-Targeted 18F-DCFPyL Versus Na18F for Bone Lesion Detection in Patients with Metastatic Prostate Cancer.', 'Gallium-68 Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen PET Imaging.', 'Recent advancements in 18F-labeled PSMA targeting PET radiopharmaceuticals.', 'High uptake of 68Ga-PSMA and 18F-DCFPyL in the peritumoral area of rat gliomas due to activated astrocytes.', 'Targeting of prostate-specific membrane antigen for radio-ligand therapy of triple-negative breast cancer.']"""
