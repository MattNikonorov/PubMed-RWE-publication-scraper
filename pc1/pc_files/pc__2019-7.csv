Methods: The expression of FOXR2 in clinical samples of prostate cancer were detected by Quantitative Real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) and Western blotting. The CCK8 proliferation kit and the Annexin V-FITC apoptosis kit, flow cytometry were used to detect the proliferation and apoptosis of prostate cancer cells with or without the FOXR2 knockdown. Combined with the results of microRNA chip, we predicted the related miR-152 and detected the relationship between miR-152 and FOXR2 by luciferase reporter gene assay. The correlation between HOTAIR and miR-152 is clearly defined by software prediction and qRT-PCR. Results: FOXR2 had a relatively high expression in the prostate cancer tissue.The mRNA expression of FOXR2 is 4.9 times that of adjacent tissues, and the protein level was also significantly up-regulated. In the PC3 cell line, the specific knock-down of FOXR2 inhibits the proliferation of cells and promotes cell apoptosis. According to the microRNA chip results and luciferase reporter gene assay, we found miR-152 could regulate the expression of FOXR2; and FOXR2 3 'UTR had two miR-152 binding sites, all of which could control the expression of FOXR2. The results of LNCediting and qRT-PCR suggest that HOTAIR is negatively correlated with the expression of miR-152, and is involved in the regulation of miR-152 expression in prostate cancer. Conclusion: FOXR2 up-regulation can promote the proliferation and inhibit the apoptosis of prostate cancer cells because that HOTAIR restrains the expression of miR-152.""","""['W B Xu', 'J Q Hou', 'J K Chang', 'S Li', 'G C Liu', 'S Q Cao']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Zhonghua Yi Xue Za Zhi""","""['Involvement of aberrantly activated HOTAIR/EZH2/miR-193a feedback loop in progression of prostate cancer.', 'miR-202 Suppresses Cell Proliferation by Targeting FOXR2 in Endometrial Adenocarcinoma.', 'Long non-coding RNA Hotair promotes gastric cancer progression via miR-217-GPC5 axis.', 'MicroR-545 mediates colorectal cancer cells proliferation through up-regulating epidermal growth factor receptor expression in HOTAIR long non-coding RNA dependent.', 'HOTAIR inhibits the proliferation of glioblastoma cells by targeting miR-219.', 'Propofol enhanced the cell sensitivity to paclitaxel (PTX) in prostatic cancer (PC) through modulation of HOTAIR.', 'Functional Interaction among lncRNA HOTAIR and MicroRNAs in Cancer and Other Human Diseases.', 'SNHG29 regulates miR-223-3p/CTNND1 axis to promote glioblastoma progression via Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway.']"""

Methods:   We retrospectively analyzed 99 patients on AS and 60 patients with previous negative TRUS-Bx, which is a total of 159 patients who underwent TTMB from May 2017 to January 2019. Cancer location was analyzed with focus on the anterior and apex lesions of the prostate after TTMB. Multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging was performed before TTMB. Cancer location after TTMB in 138 patients, excluding 21 patients who were not eligible for analysis (4 patients on AS and 17 patients with previous negative TRUS-Bx) was compared with Prostate Imaging-Reporting and Data System version 2 (PI-RADSTM v2) score. Factors that may affect detecting cancer after TTMB with previous negative TRUS-Bx was analyzed using a logistic regression model.  Results:   In AS patients, 29 patients (29.3%) exhibited an upgrade in Gleason score (GS) after TTMB. Among them, 22 patients (75.9%) showed at the anterior or apex lesions. In patients with previous negative TRUS-Bx, 18 patients (30.0%) were diagnosed with prostate cancer. Among them, 13 patients (72.2%) exhibited cancer at the anterior or apex lesion. Among the 25 AS patients with PI-RADSTM score 1-2, 5 patients (20.0%) showed an upgrade in GS. Among the 26 patients with previous negative TRUS-Bx and PI-RADSTM score 1-2, 6 patients (23.1%) had cancer. In multivariate regression model, prostate volume (OR 0.951) was identified as the predictor for a positive biopsy result after TTMB with previous negative TRUS-Bx.  Conclusions:   TTMB is efficient for patients on AS in the detection of upgraded cancer located in anterior or apex or those with previous negative TRUS-Bx in the detection of anterior or apex cancer. In PI-RADSTM score 1-2, a substantial proportion of patients after experienced upgrade in GS on AS patients or cancer detection on previous negative TRUS-Bx.

The clinical need for such large dosimeters follows from the increased use of extended-field radiation therapy (EFRT). E.g. for prostate cancer EFRT is currently used in the first prospective trial investigating the benefit of adding elective irradiation of the para-aortic lymph nodes in pN1 prostate cancer. The full extent of these EFRT dose distributions is not covered by the well-established standard sized radiochromic film or 2D detector arrays. Here we investigate an OSL calibration methodology, that tackles BaFBr-based OSL's inherent energy dependence by a class solution specific calibration. 10 EFRT treatment plans used in the PART trial were investigated. One plan was used to build a class solution specific bilinear calibration model, that distinguishes between in-field and penumbra dose contributions. The effect of this calibration was evaluated with respect to a standard linear calibration, using standard IMRT patterns, the nine remaining patient plans, and to smaller prostate treatment plans. A single OSL-dosimeter could be reused for all measurements. The dosimeter captured the full extent of the dose distributions (maximum EFRT field size = 33.5 cm). The bilinear correction reduced the residual dose differences from above 10% to an average of 0.7% (max 3.6%) in comparison with a Monte Carlo simulation. Consequently global gamma agreement scores (3%-3 mm) of 95.5% ± 2.7% were reached. A more strict local evaluation resulted in an average gamma-agreement score of 93.3% ± 3.2%. The BaFBr-based OSL film, with reduced Z eff requires a class-solution specific correction. The current work shows that such a correction can be as simple as a bilinear residual dose correction driven by the measured signal. As far as we know this is the first 2D dosimeter combining reusability, a sub-mm resolution, and a size covering the typical EFRT treatment plans.""","""['Robin De Roover', 'Charlien Berghen', 'Gert De Meerleer', 'Tom Depuydt', 'Wouter Crijns']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Phys Med Biol""","""['A reusable OSL-film for 2D radiotherapy dosimetry.', 'Optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) of carbon-doped aluminum oxide (Al2O3:C) for film dosimetry in radiotherapy.', 'Calibration and time fading characterization of a new optically stimulated luminescence film dosimeter.', 'Development and characterization of a three-dimensional radiochromic film stack dosimeter for megavoltage photon beam dosimetry.', 'Characterization of Al2O3 optically stimulated luminescence films for 2D dosimetry using a 6 MV photon beam.']"""

In this study, we examined the mechanism of action of miR-139-5p, one of the downregulated miRNAs identified in the panel.  Methods:   Using a cohort of 585 patients treated with radical prostatectomy, we examined the prognostic significance of miR-139 (dichotomized around the median) using the Kaplan-Meier method and Cox proportional hazard models. We validated these results using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data. We created cell lines that overexpressed miR-139 to confirm its targets as well as examine pathways through which miR-139 may function using cell-based assays.  Results:   Low miR-139 expression was significantly associated with a variety of prognostic factors in prostate cancer, including Gleason score, pathologic stage, margin positivity, and lymph node status. MiR-139 expression was associated with prognosis: the cumulative incidence of biochemical recurrence and metastasis were significantly lower among patients with high miR-139 expression (P = .0004 and .038, respectively). Validation in the TCGA data set showed a significant association between dichotomized miR-139 expression and biochemical recurrence (odds ratio, 0.52; 95% confidence interval, 0.33-0.82). Overexpression of miR-139 in prostate cancer cells led to a significant reduction in cell proliferation and migration compared with control cells, with cells arrested in G2 of cell cycle. IGF1R and AXL were identified as potential targets of miR-139 based on multiple miRNA-binding sites in 3'-untranslated regions of both the genes and their association with prostate cancer growth pathways. Luciferase assays verified AXL and IGF1R as direct targets of miR-139. Furthermore, immunoblotting of prostate cancer cells demonstrated IGF1R and AXL protein expression were inhibited by miR-139 treatment, which was reversed by the addition of miR-139 antagomir. Examination of the molecular mechanism of growth inhibition by miR-139 revealed the downregulation of activated AKT and cyclin D1, with upregulation of the CDK inhibitor p21.  Conclusions:   miR-139 is associated with improved prognosis in patients with localized prostate cancer, which may be mediated through downregulation of IGF1R and/or AXL and associated signaling pathway components.""","""['Robert K Nam', 'Tania Benatar', 'Christopher J D Wallis', 'Elizabeth Kobylecky', 'Yutaka Amemiya', 'Christopher Sherman', 'Arun Seth']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Identification of the receptor tyrosine kinase AXL in breast cancer as a target for the human miR-34a microRNA.', 'MiR-301a regulates E-cadherin expression and is predictive of prostate cancer recurrence.', 'miR-196a-mediated downregulation of p27kip1 protein promotes prostate cancer proliferation and relates to biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy.', 'Axl receptor tyrosine kinase is up-regulated in metformin resistant prostate cancer cells.', 'Targeting AXL in mesothelioma: From functional characterization to clinical implication.', 'Tumor suppressive role of microRNA-139-5p in bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells-derived extracellular vesicles in bladder cancer through regulation of the KIF3A/p21 axis.', 'Targeting Protein Kinases and Epigenetic Control as Combinatorial Therapy Options for Advanced Prostate Cancer Treatment.', 'The Role of Non-Coding RNAs in Autophagy During Carcinogenesis.', 'MiR-5195-3p functions as a tumor suppressor in prostate cancer via targeting CCNL1.', 'MicroRNA‑195‑5p is associated with cell proliferation, migration and invasion in prostate cancer and targets MIB1.']"""

The pathological upgrading after radical prostatectomy (RP) were investigated in patients who were eligible for AS in the present study.  Methods:   Between August 2006 and July 2017, 627 patients underwent RP in our institution. One hundred and thirty-six patients who were eligible for AS at the time of RP were included in this study. The previously defined AS criteria Gleason 3 + 3=6 adenocarcinoma at maximum two biopsy cores, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) < 10 ng/mL and clinical T stage ≤ 2a were used in the study. The demographics, clinical, and histopathological outcomes were retrospectively compared between two groups, which were divided in accordance with the upgrading status at final pathology as Group 1 (n = 67, upgrading) and Group 2 (n = 69, nonupgrading).  Results:   Gleason upgrading (GU) was found in 67 (49.3%) patients, and 17 patients (12.5%) were upstaged to pT3a. The upgrading to Gleason 3 + 4 was reported in 38.7% of patients, however, 7.4%, and 3.7% of the patients were upgraded to Gleason 4 + 3, and Gleason 4 + 4, respectively. The 10.3% of the patients had extraprostatic involvement, and the rate (19.4% vs 1.4%, P = .002) was significantly higher in Group 1.

Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) reportedly play crucial roles in human cancer progression in many studies. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying PCa progression remain unclear.  Materials and methods:   We investigated the lncRNA transcriptome using publicly available RNA-sequencing data to identify prostate-specific lncRNAs. Then, the chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay identified lncRNA with a direct binding to androgen receptor (AR), hereafter denoted as PSLNR. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis and Western blot analysis were performed to detect the expression of p53 signaling-related genes after overexpression PSLNR. The effects of overexpression of PSLNR on cell proliferation, cell cycle, and cell apoptosis were assessed by using CCK-8 and flow cytometric analysis. We then detected the expression of PSLNR in tissues.  Result:   We reported a novel androgen-reduced prostate-specific lncRNA, PSLNR, that inhibited PCa progression via the p53-dependent pathway. By analyzing the NOCODE data set, we reported that PSLNR was specifically expressed in the prostate, suggesting the potential of PSLNR as a biomarker for PCa treatment. The AR pathway was also confirmed to be an upstream regulation signaling pathway of PSLNR by transcriptionally regulating its expression in androgen-dependent PCa cells. PSLNR also significantly inhibited PCa proliferation by inducing cell apoptosis in a p53-dependent manner. Thus, PSLNR may be a candidate diagnosis and therapeutic target for PCa.

The objective of our study was to analyze the feasibility and potential role of robotic-assisted transrectal MRI-guided biopsy for the diagnosis of prostate cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS. A total of 57 patients (mean age, 67 ± 6 [SD] years; age range, 57-83 years; mean prostate-specific antigen level, 10.7 ± 6.1 ng/mL) with a single prostatic lesion visible on biparametric MRI (T2-weighted and DW images) underwent robotic-assisted MRI-guided transrectal biopsy. The procedure was analyzed in terms of technical success, defined by an accurate alignment of the needle guide with the lesion; occupation time of the MRI room; number of cores; cancer detection rate (CDR); and complications. RESULTS. The biparametric MRI score was 3, 4, and 5 in 11 (19%), 30 (53%), and 16 (28%) of the 57 patients, respectively. Twenty-three lesions (23/57, 40%) originated in the peripheral zone and 34 (34/57, 60%) in the transition zone. Software-based adjustments of the robot allowed the needle guide to be aligned with the target in all lesions. The number of cores was one, two, three, and four in one (2%), 36 (63%), 18 (32%), and three (5%) patients, respectively. Obtaining more than two cores had no incremental value in determining the Gleason score or the maximum cancer core length (MCCL). The overall CDR for any cancer was 67% (38/57). It was 95% (36/38) for tumors with Gleason grade of more than 3 or MCCL greater than 3 mm and 53% (20/38) for tumors with Gleason score greater than 6. No complications were observed. The median occupation time of the MRI room was 37.8 ± 9.7 minutes (range, 32-74 minutes). CONCLUSION. Robotic-assisted MRI-guided biopsy yields 100% technical success rate with a short MRI room occupation time and high CDRs using one or two cores.""","""['Matthias Barral', 'Arnaud Lefevre', 'Philippe Camparo', 'Martijn Hoogenboom', 'Thibaut Pierre', 'Philippe Soyer', 'François Cornud']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""AJR Am J Roentgenol""","""['Robotic-assisted transrectal MRI-guided biopsy.

Materials and methods:   A stably transfected cell line, in which filamin A expression was suppressed by RNA interference, was first established. Then, the effects of the suppression of filamin A gene expression on the biological characteristics of human PCa LNCaP cells were observed through cell morphology, in vitro cell growth curve, soft agar cloning assay, and scratch test.  Results:   A cell line model with a low expression of filamin A was successfully constructed on the basis of LNCaP cells. The morphology of cells transfected with plasmid pSilencer-filamin A was the following: Cells were loosely arranged, had less connection with each other, had fewer tentacles, and presented a fibrous look. The growth rate of LNCap cells was faster than cells transfected with plasmid pSilencer-filamin A (P<0.05). The clones of LNCap cells in the soft agar cloning assay was significantly fewer than that of cells stably transfected with plasmid pSilencer-filamin A (P<0.05). Cells stably transfected with plasmid pSilencer-filamin A presented with a stronger healing and migration ability compared to LNCap cells (healing rate was 32.2% and 12.1%, respectively; P<0.05).

Materials and Methods::   All men with clinical indications for image-guided biopsy undergo 3-Tesla multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) first. Lesions identified on mpMRI are graded using the Prostate Imaging-Reporting and Data System version 2.0 (PI-RADS v2) grading system. At the time of biopsy, real-time 3-dimensional (3D) transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) imaging is acquired and elastically fused with the mpMRI. Both targeted biopsies of MRI-derived suspicious lesions (PI-RADS 3-5) and systematic 12-core biopsies are performed. Patients without suspicious lesion on mpMRI undergo 3D TRUS-guided biopsy in standard templated fashion. In men placed on active surveillance (AS), prior positive sites are revisited using the trajectory and tracking functions of the fusion biopsy software.  Results::   The advantages of MRI/TRUS fusion biopsy for prostate cancer diagnosis and surveillance are numerous. The 3D model created by elastic fusion of real-time TRUS imaging to mpMRI provides excellent visualization of prostate anatomy. Suspicious lesions on mpMRI can be accurately targeted, increasing detection of clinically significant prostate cancer. Biopsy trajectory visualization provides spatial localization of the trajectory of the cores within the prostate. Systematic biopsies are also taken in addition to targeted cores to minimize the effect of the mpMRI-invisible lesion. Prior positive biopsy sites can be tracked in men on AS.

Objective:   To analyze the association between ADT exposure and diagnosis of Alzheimer disease or dementia among elderly men with prostate cancer.  Design, setting, and participants:   This retrospective cohort study used data from the National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-Medicare linked database. Participants were 154 089 elderly men newly diagnosed with prostate cancer between 1996 and 2003. The analyses were conducted between November 1, 2018, and December 31, 2018.  Exposure:   Androgen deprivation therapy.  Main outcomes and measures:   Patients receiving ADT within 2 years of prostate cancer diagnosis were identified. Survival analysis was used to determine the association between ADT exposure and diagnosis of Alzheimer disease or dementia in the follow-up period. Propensity score and instrumental variable approaches were used to minimize measured and unmeasured selection bias. The association by dose of ADT was also examined.  Results:   Of the 295 733 men diagnosed with prostate cancer between 1996 and 2003, 154 089 met the study criteria.

Understanding the factors influencing AR-mediated gene expression provides new opportunities for therapeutic intervention. Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerase (PARP) is a family of enzymes, which posttranslationally modify a range of proteins and regulate many different cellular processes. PARP-1 and PARP-2 are two well-characterized PARP members, whose catalytic activity is induced by DNA-strand breaks and responsible for multiple DNA damage repair pathways. PARP inhibitors are promising therapeutic agents that show synthetic lethality against many types of cancer (including PCa) with homologous recombination (HR) DNA-repair deficiency. Here, we show that, beyond DNA damage repair function, PARP-2, but not PARP-1, is a critical component in AR transcriptional machinery through interacting with the pioneer factor FOXA1 and facilitating AR recruitment to genome-wide prostate-specific enhancer regions. Analyses of PARP-2 expression at both mRNA and protein levels show significantly higher expression of PARP-2 in primary PCa tumors than in benign prostate tissues, and even more so in castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) tumors. Selective targeting of PARP-2 by genetic or pharmacological means blocks interaction between PARP-2 and FOXA1, which in turn attenuates AR-mediated gene expression and inhibits AR-positive PCa growth. Next-generation antiandrogens act through inhibiting androgen synthesis (abiraterone) or blocking ligand binding (enzalutamide). Selective targeting of PARP-2, however, may provide an alternative therapeutic approach for AR inhibition by disruption of FOXA1 function, which may be beneficial to patients, irrespective of their DNA-repair deficiency status.""","""['Bin Gui', 'Fu Gui', 'Tomoaki Takai', 'Chao Feng', 'Xiao Bai', 'Ladan Fazli', 'Xuesen Dong', 'Shuai Liu', 'Xiaofeng Zhang', 'Wei Zhang', 'Adam S Kibel', 'Li Jia']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A""","""['Re: Selective Targeting of PARP-2 Inhibits Androgen Receptor Signaling and Prostate Cancer Growth through Disruption of FOXA1 Function.', 'Androgen receptor inhibitor-induced ""BRCAness"" and PARP inhibition are synthetically lethal for castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Targeting poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase and the c-Myb-regulated DNA damage response pathway in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Dual roles of PARP-1 promote cancer growth and progression.', 'Olaparib for the treatment of metastatic prostate cancer.', 'Shaping Chromatin States in Prostate Cancer by Pioneer Transcription Factors.', 'PARP2 promotes inflammation in psoriasis by modulating estradiol biosynthesis in keratinocytes.', 'NAD+ metabolism-based immunoregulation and therapeutic potential.', 'Use of PARP inhibitors in prostate cancer: from specific to broader application.', 'CRISPR screens reveal genetic determinants of PARP inhibitor sensitivity and resistance in prostate cancer.', 'Androgen Receptor Splice Variants Contribute to the Upregulation of DNA Repair in Prostate Cancer.']"""

DNA-PK is deregulated in selected cancer types and is strongly associated with poor outcome. The underlying mechanisms by which DNA-PK promotes aggressive tumor phenotypes are not well understood. Here, unbiased molecular investigation in clinically relevant tumor models reveals novel functions of DNA-PK in cancer.Experimental Design: DNA-PK function was modulated using both genetic and pharmacologic methods in a series of in vitro models, in vivo xenografts, and patient-derived explants (PDE), and the impact on the downstream signaling and cellular cancer phenotypes was discerned. Data obtained were used to develop novel strategies for combinatorial targeting of DNA-PK and hormone signaling pathways.  Results:   Key findings reveal that (i) DNA-PK regulates tumor cell proliferation; (ii) pharmacologic targeting of DNA-PK suppresses tumor growth both in vitro, in vivo, and ex vivo; (iii) DNA-PK transcriptionally regulates the known DNA-PK-mediated functions as well as novel cancer-related pathways that promote tumor growth; (iv) dual targeting of DNA-PK/TOR kinase (TORK) transcriptionally upregulates androgen signaling, which can be mitigated using the androgen receptor (AR) antagonist enzalutamide; (v) cotargeting AR and DNA-PK/TORK leads to the expansion of antitumor effects, uncovering the modulation of novel, highly relevant protumorigenic cancer pathways; and (viii) cotargeting DNA-PK/TORK and AR has cooperative growth inhibitory effects in vitro and in vivo.

The main objective of this study was to elucidate the role of miR-130b as a contributor to prostate cancer health disparity in AA patients. We also determined whether miR-130b is a prognostic biomarker and a new therapeutic candidate for AA prostate cancer. A comprehensive approach of using cell lines, tissue samples, and the TCGA database was employed. We performed a series of functional assays such as cell proliferation, migration, invasion, RT2-PCR array, qRT-PCR, cell cycle, luciferase reporter, immunoblot, and IHC. Various statistical approaches such as Kaplan-Meier, uni-, and multivariate analyses were utilized to determine the clinical significance of miR-130b. Our results showed that elevated levels of miR-130b correlated with race disparity and PSA levels/failure and acted as an independent prognostic biomarker for AA patients. Two tumor suppressor genes, CDKN1B and FHIT, were validated as direct functional targets of miR-130b. We also found race-specific cell-cycle pathway activation in AA patients with prostate cancer. Functionally, miR-130b inhibition reduced cell proliferation, colony formation, migration/invasion, and induced cell-cycle arrest. Inhibition of miR-130b modulated critical prostate cancer-related biological pathways in AA compared with EA prostate cancer patients. In conclusion, attenuation of miR-130b expression has tumor suppressor effects in AA prostate cancer. miR-130b is a significant contributor to prostate cancer racial disparity as its overexpression is a risk factor for poor prognosis in AA patients with prostate cancer.

Here we report on the cloning of a novel splice variant of FGFR3 that is preferentially expressed in African American (AA) prostate cancer. This novel variant (FGFR3-S) omits exon 14, comprising 123 nucleotides that encode the activation loop in the intracellular split kinase domain. Ectopic overexpression of FGFR3-S in European American (EA) prostate cancer cell lines (PC-3 and LNCaP) led to enhanced receptor autophosphorylation and increased activation of the downstream signaling effectors AKT, STAT3, and ribosomal S6 compared with FGFR3-L (retains exon 14). The increased oncogenic signaling imparted by FGFR3-S was associated with a substantial gain in proliferative and antiapoptotic activities, as well as a modest but significant gain in cell motility. Moreover, the FGFR3-S-conferred proliferative and motility gains were highly resistant to the pan-FGFR small-molecule inhibitor dovitinib and the antiapoptotic gain was insensitive to the cytotoxic drug docetaxel, which stands in marked contrast with dovitinib- and docetaxel-sensitive FGFR3-L. In an in vivo xenograft model, mice injected with PC-3 cells overexpressing FGFR3-S exhibited significantly increased tumor growth and resistance to dovitinib treatment compared with cells overexpressing FGFR3-L. In agreement with our in vitro and in vivo findings, a high FGFR3-S/FGFR3-L expression ratio in prostate cancer specimens was associated with poor patient prognosis.

The relationship between prostate volume and GS upgrading should be defined, aiming to reduce upgrading rates in patients with low risk groups who are eligible for active surveillance (AS) or minimally invasive treatment, by varying biopsy cores, or lengths of cores according to prostate volumes. In this regard, the aim of our study was to establish the relationship between prostate volume and GS upgrading.  Materials and methods:   We retrospectively analyzed the medical records of 78 patients, who were appropriate for AS between 2011-2016 at our hospital. Inclusion criteria were patient age under 65 years, PSA level under 10 ng/ml, GS (3 + 3) or (3 + 4), and 3 or less positive cores, clinical stages ≤ T2. GS increase in radical prostatectomy specimen was considered as 'upgrading' and in addition, score reported by biopsy as 3 + 4 but in surgical specimen as 4 + 3 were also considered as 'upgrading'. The effect of prostate volume on Gleason grade upgrading was examined by calculating upgrading rates separately for patients with prostate volume 30 ml or less, those with 30 to 60 ml, and those over 60 ml.  Results:   As a result of the analysis of the data, upgrading was seen in 35 (44.8%) of 78 patients included in the study. In the cohort mean prostate volume was 49.8 (± 26.3) ml. Twenty-two patients (28.2%) had prostate volume 30 ml or less, 34 (43.6%) 30 to 60 ml, and 22 (28.2%) 60 ml or more. The patients were divided into two groups as those with and without GS upgrading. Between the groups prostate volume and prostate volume range (0-30/31-60/> 60) were not significantly different (p value > 0.05).  Conclusions:   Gleason grade upgrading causes patients to be classified in a lower risk group than they actually are, and may lead to inappropriate treatment. This condition has a direct effect on the decision of active surveillance. Therefore, it is important to define the factors that can predict GS upgrading in active surveillance appropriate patients. In this study, we found that prostate volume has no significant effect on upgrading in active surveillance appropriate patients.""","""['Emre Çamur', 'Alper Coşkun', 'Ӧvünç Kavukoğlu', 'Utku Can', 'Önder Kara', 'Arzu Develi Çamur', 'Kemal Sarıca', 'Kamil Fehmi Narter']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Arch Ital Urol Androl""","""['Pathological upgrading in prostate cancer patients eligible for active surveillance: Does prostate-specific antigen density matter?', 'Population based study of predictors of adverse pathology among candidates for active surveillance with Gleason 6 prostate cancer.', 'A biopsy-integrated algorithm for determining Gleason 6 upgrading risk stratifies risk of active surveillance failure in prostate cancer.', 'Active surveillance in prostate cancer.', 'Active surveillance: patient selection.', 'CRMP4 CpG Hypermethylation Predicts Upgrading to Gleason Score ≥ 8 in Prostate Cancer.']"""

We and others have identified an association between the nuclear localization of NF-κB p65 and biochemical recurrence (BCR) in PC in small and/or single-centre cohorts of patients.  Methods and findings:   In this study, we accessed 2 different multi-centre tissue microarrays (TMAs) representing cohorts of patients (Test-TMA and Validation-TMA series) of the Canadian Prostate Cancer Biomarker Network (CPCBN) to validate the association between p65 nuclear frequency and PC outcomes. Immunohistochemical staining of p65 was performed on the Test-TMA and Validation-TMA series, which include PC tissues from patients treated by first-line radical prostatectomy (n = 250 and n = 1,262, respectively). Two independent observers evaluated the p65 nuclear frequency in digital images of cancer tissue and benign adjacent gland tissue. Kaplan-Meier curves coupled with a log-rank test and univariate and multivariate Cox regression models were used for statistical analyses of continuous values and dichotomized data (cutoff of 3%). Multivariate analysis of the Validation-TMA cohort showed that p65 nuclear frequency in cancer cells was an independent predictor of BCR using continuous (hazard ratio [HR] 1.02 [95% CI 1.00-1.03], p = 0.004) and dichotomized data (HR 1.33 [95% CI 1.09-1.62], p = 0.005). Using a cutoff of 3%, we found that this biomarker was also associated with the development of bone metastases (HR 1.82 [95% CI 1.05-3.16], p = 0.033) and PC-specific mortality (HR 2.63 [95% CI 1.30-5.31], p = 0.004), independent of clinical parameters.

Patients, subjects and methods:   The pelvic dimensions of 78 RARP patients were measured on preoperative magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography by three radiologists. Surgeon automated performance metrics (APMs [instrument motion tracking and system events data, i.e., camera movement, third-arm swap, energy use]) were obtained by a systems data recorder (Intuitive Surgical, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) during RARP. Two analyses were performed: Analysis 1, examined effects of patient characteristics, pelvic dimensions and prior surgeon RARP caseload on APMs using linear regression; Analysis 2, the effects of patient body habitus, bony pelvic measurement, and surgeon experience on short- and long-term outcomes were analysed by multivariable regression.  Results:   Analysis 1 showed that while surgeon experience affected the greatest number of APMs (P < 0.044), the patient's body mass index, bony pelvic dimensions, and prostate size also affected APMs during each surgical step (P < 0.043, P < 0.046, P < 0.034, respectively). Analysis 2 showed that RARP duration was significantly affected by pelvic depth (β = 13.7, P = 0.039) and prostate volume (β = 0.5, P = 0.024). A wider and shallower pelvis was less likely to result in a positive margin (odds ratio 0.25, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.09-0.72). On multivariate analysis, urinary continence recovery was associated with surgeon's prior RARP experience (hazard ratio [HR] 2.38, 95% CI 1.18-4.81; P = 0.015), but not on pelvic dimensions (HR 1.44, 95% CI 0.95-2.17).

Clinical data are directly extracted from the structured documentation in the electronic medical record (EMR).Materials and methods: The urological department at IH treats about 200 patients with robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP) annually. All consenting patients registered with the procedure code for RARP are included in TECLA. Clinical data are obtained automatically from the EMR, by structured forms. Patient-reported outcome and experience measures (PROMs and PREMs) are filled in by the patients on an iPad or a smartphone.Results: The basic construct of TECLA is presented. From August 2017 to June 2018, 200 men were treated with RARP, of which 182 (91%) provided consent for inclusion in the register. Of these, 97% completed the PROM survey before treatment and 91% at 3 months follow-up. PREMs were completed by 78%. All clinical variables for the hospital stay and for the 6-week follow-up were more than 95% complete.Conclusion: This entirely electronic surgical quality register is easy to use, both for patients and clinicians, and has a high capture rate.

For patients with metastatic prostate cancer, noninvasive serial measurements of bloodborne cells may provide a means to tailor therapeutic decisions based on an individual patient's response. Here, we used a high-sensitivity profiling approach to monitor CTCs in patients with metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) undergoing treatment with abiraterone and enzalutamide, two drugs used to treat advanced prostate cancer. The capture and profiling approach uses antibody-functionalized magnetic nanoparticles to sort cells according to protein expression levels. CTCs are tagged with magnetic nanoparticles conjugated to an antibody specific for the epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM) and sorted into four zones of a microfluidic device based on EpCAM expression levels. Our approach was compared to the FDA-cleared CellSearch method, and we demonstrate significantly higher capture efficiency of low-EpCAM cells compared to the commercial method. The nanoparticle-based approach detected CTCs from 86% of patients at baseline, compared to CellSearch which only detected CTCs from 60% of patients. Patients were stratified as prostate specific antigen (PSA) progressive versus responsive based on clinically acceptable definitions, and it was observed that patients with a limited response to therapy had elevated levels of androgen receptor variant 7 (ARV7) and the mesenchymal marker, N-cadherin, expressed on their CTCs. In addition, these CTCs exhibited lower EpCAM expression. The results highlight features of CTCs associated with disease progression on abiraterone or enzalutamide, including mesenchymal phenotypes and increased expression levels of ARV7. The use of a high-sensitivity method to capture and profile CTCs provides more informative data concerning the phenotypic properties of these cells as patients undergo treatment relative to an FDA-cleared method.""","""['Brenda J Green', 'Vivian Nguyen', 'Eshetu Atenafu', 'Phillip Weeber', 'Bill T V Duong', 'Punithan Thiagalingam', 'Mahmoud Labib', 'Reza M Mohamadi', 'Aaron R Hansen', 'Anthony M Joshua', 'Shana O Kelley']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Anal Chem""","""['Circulating tumor cells and survival in abiraterone- and enzalutamide-treated patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Synaptophysin expression on circulating tumor cells in patients with castration resistant prostate cancer undergoing treatment with abiraterone acetate or enzalutamide.', 'Identification of mechanisms of resistance to treatment with abiraterone acetate or enzalutamide in patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC).', 'Using circulating tumor cells to inform on prostate cancer biology and clinical utility.', 'Circulating tumour cells: the evolving concept and the inadequacy of their enrichment by EpCAM-based methodology for basic and clinical cancer research.', 'SAIF: Label-Free Separation of Circulating Tumor Cells Using a Self-Amplified Inertial Focusing Microfluidic Chip.', 'Unraveling Cancer Metastatic Cascade Using Microfluidics-based Technologies.', 'Integrated microfluidic single-cell immunoblotting chip enables high-throughput isolation, enrichment and direct protein analysis of circulating tumor cells.', 'Mesenchymal Characteristics and Predictive Biomarkers on Circulating Tumor Cells for Therapeutic Strategy.', 'A liquid biopsy for detecting circulating mesothelial precursor cells: A new biomarker for diagnosis and prognosis in mesothelioma.']"""

This warrants further exploration of related molecular targets for patient screening, detection of metastatic disease, and treatment/treatment monitoring. Recent studies have indicated that neurotensin receptors (NTSRs) and their ligand neurotensin (NTS) critically affect the progression of prostate cancers. In this study, we evaluated the expression of neurotensin receptor1 (NTSR1) in patient tissues and performed NTSR1 PET imaging in a prostate cancer animal model.  Methods:   The NTSR1 expression was evaluated in 97 cases of prostate cancer and 100 cases of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) of clinical patients by immunohistochemistry staining. The expression profile of PSMA and GRPR was also performed for comparison. The mRNA expression of NTSR1 in LnCap and PC-3 cells was measured by PCR. NTSR1 PET, and biodistribution studies were performed in PC-3 xenografts using 18F-DEG-VS-NT.  Results:   NTSR1 showed high or moderate expression in 91.8% of prostate cancer tissue, compared with PSMA (86.7%) and GRPR (65.3%). All examined PSMA-negative tissues showed positive NTSR1 expression, suggesting the potential complementary role of NTSR1 targeted imaging or therapy. Only 8% of BPH shows strong or moderate expression of NTSR1, which is significantly lower than that in prostate cancer (91.8%). PCR results indicated LNCap (an androgen-dependent prostate cancer cell) showed negative NTSR1 expression while PC-3 demonstrated positive expression (an androgen-independent prostate cancer cell), which correlated well with previously reported western blot results. In a preclinical animal model, NTSR1 targeted PET probe 18F-DEG-VS-NT demonstrated prominent tumor accumulation and low background.  Conclusion:   We have demonstrated that NTSR1 is a promising molecular marker for prostate cancer based on patient tissue staining. The NTSR targeted probe 18F-DEG-VS-NT demonstrated high tumor to background contrast in animal models, which could be valuable in selecting patients for therapies targeting NTSR1 as well as monitoring therapeutic efficacy during treatment accordingly.""","""['Tingting He#', 'Mengzhe Wang#', 'Hui Wang', 'Hongpei Tan', 'Yongxiang Tang', 'Eric Smith', 'Zhanhong Wu', 'Weihua Liao', 'Shuo Hu', 'Zibo Li']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Eur J Nucl Med Mol Imaging""","""['68Ga-DOTA-NT-20.3 Neurotensin Receptor 1 PET Imaging as a Surrogate for Neuroendocrine Differentiation of Prostate Cancer.', 'A comparative study of peptide-based imaging agents 68GaGa-PSMA-11, 68GaGa-AMBA, 68GaGa-NODAGA-RGD and 68GaGa-DOTA-NT-20.3 in preclinical prostate tumour models.', 'Prostate cancer targeting motifs: expression of αν β3, neurotensin receptor 1, prostate specific membrane antigen, and prostate stem cell antigen in human prostate cancer cell lines and xenografts.', 'The potential use of the neurotensin high affinity receptor 1 as a biomarker for cancer progression and as a component of personalized medicine in selective cancers.', 'Phylogenetic history, pharmacological features, and signal transduction of neurotensin receptors in vertebrates.', 'Theranostics of Primary Prostate Cancer: Beyond PSMA and GRP-R.', 'Construction of a Redox-Related Prognostic Model with Predictive Value in Survival and Therapeutic Response for Patients with Lung Adenocarcinoma.', '68Ga-DOTA-NT-20.3 Neurotensin Receptor 1 PET Imaging as a Surrogate for Neuroendocrine Differentiation of Prostate Cancer.', 'Regulation of Neuroendocrine-like Differentiation in Prostate Cancer by Non-Coding RNAs.', 'Expression of neurotensin receptor-1 (NTS1) in primary breast tumors, cellular distribution, and association with clinical and biological factors.']"""

Data from the Southern Community Cohort Study were used to evaluate associations between SE adversity and perceived stress in relation to prostate cancer risk, overall and by race/ethnicity and grade. Between 2002 and 2009, 26,741 men completed a questionnaire, from which an 8-item SE adversity composite was created (covering socioeconomic status, residential environment, and social support/buffers). Two items from the Perceived Stress Scale were assessed. With follow-up through 2011, 527 prostate cancer cases were diagnosed. In multivariable models, each one-unit increase in the SE adversity composite was associated with increased prostate cancer risk among non-Hispanic white (NHW) men (HR 1.23; 95% CI 1.02-1.48) and reduced risk among NHB men (HR 0.89; 95% CI 0.82-0.95) (p interaction: 0.001).

Methods:   Fifty patients who underwent two 3-T MR examinations of the prostate were included in this IRB-approved retrospective uncontrolled, unrandomized study. All received two scans (mean time interval, 20.5 months) including T1-weighted DCE-MR imaging, one with 0.5 M gadoterate meglumine and one with 1.0 M gadobutrol. Equimolar doses of gadolinium (0.1 mmol/kg body weight) were administered with identical injection speed (2 mL/s), resulting in differing gadolinium delivery rate. An identical region of interest (ROItz) within a BPH-node was identified on both scans. The area under the time-enhancement curve of each ROItz from 0 to 180 s post contrast arrival and pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated. Relative enhancement and signal-to-noise (SNR) and contrast-to-noise (CNR) ratios in the delayed phase at about 180 s were compared between both agents.  Results:   There was a significantly larger area under the time-enhancement curve (5.53 vs 4.97 p = 0.0007) and higher relative enhancement of BPH nodules (2.23 vs 1.96 p < 0.0001) with gadobutrol compared with gadoterate meglumine. There were no significant differences in SNR (44.55 vs 37.63 p = 0.12), CNR (31.22 vs 26.39 p = 0.18), and pharmacokinetic parameters Ktrans (0.31 vs 0.32 p = 0.86), Ve (1.36 vs 0.98 p = 0.13), and Kep (0.34 vs 0.36 p = 0.12).  Conclusions:   At equimolar doses, increased gadolinium delivery over time using gadobutrol provides higher relative enhancement parameters in BPH nodules compared with gadoterate meglumine, but does not translate into improved SNR or CNR.  Key points:   • At equal injection rate and equimolar total dose, gadobutrol compared with gadoterate meglumine provides a significantly greater relative enhancement in DCE-MR imaging of BPH over the first 180 s. • There are no significant differences in SNRs, CNRs, and pharmacokinetic parameters between the two GBCAs.""","""['Chau Hung Lee', 'Balamurugan Vellayappan', 'Matthias Taupitz', 'Bernd Hamm', 'Patrick Asbach']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Eur Radiol""","""['Dynamic and static magnetic resonance angiography of the supra-aortic vessels at 3.0 T: intraindividual comparison of gadobutrol, gadobenate dimeglumine, and gadoterate meglumine at equimolar dose.', 'Comparative evaluation of lesion enhancement using 1 M gadobutrol vs. 2 conventional gadolinium chelates, all at a dose of 0.1 mmol/kg, in a rat brain tumor model at 3 T.', 'Comparison of Dynamic Contrast-Enhancement Parameters between Gadobutrol and Gadoterate Meglumine in Posttreatment Glioma: A Prospective Intraindividual Study.', 'High-relaxivity contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance neuroimaging: a review.', 'Gadobutrol: a review of its use for contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging in adults and children.', 'Dynamic Contrast Enhanced Study in Multiparametric Examination of the Prostate-Can We Make Better Use of It?']"""

Thermal ablation might activate tumor-specific T cells by raising the presentation of tumor-specific antigens and hindering tumor negative immune regulation. Our aim was to assess T cell infiltrate pre- and post-cryoablation in a prospective observational study.  Methods:   A total of 240 sextant prostate biopsies cores (12 cores/patient) were collected from 10 unilateral prostate cancer patients (T1c, PSA density < 0.15 ng/dL, Gleason grade group 1, ≤ 2 cancer biopsy cores, and < 50% cancer core involvement) at diagnosis and 12 months after hemi-cryoablation. Cancer-positive (Diag+) and cancer-negative (Diag-) lobes at diagnosis and the same areas 12 months after hemi-cryoablation (Cryo+ and Cryo-, respectively) were explored by immunohistochemistry for infiltrating CD4+ and CD8+ T cells (in 45 random fields per prostate lobe, 400× magnification). The quantitative analysis of cells/mm2 and CD4+/CD8+ ratio were performed and compared among Diag+, Diag-, Cryo+, and Cryo- using ImageJ software.  Results:   There was a significant increase in tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T cells/mm2 in the Cryo+ tissue (mean, SD 0.31, 0.30) compared to Diag+ (0.18, 0.15), p = 0.015; confirmed in prostate acini (hot spots), p = 0.029, in which infiltrating CD4+/CD8+ T cells' ratio decreased after hemi-cryoablation, p = 0.006.

Here, we investigated the impact of modulated radiation fields on radio-sensitivity and cell recovery during dose delivery. We generated experimental survival data after single-dose, split-dose and fractionated irradiation in normal human skin fibroblast cells (AGO1522) and human prostate cancer cells (DU145). The dose was delivered to either 50% of the area of a T25 flask containing the cells (half-field) or 100% of the flask (uniform-field). We also modelled the impact of dose-rate effects and intercellular signalling on cell-killing. Applying the model to the survival data, it is found that (i) in-field cell survival under half-field exposure is higher than uniform-field exposure for the same delivered dose; (ii) the importance of sub-lethal damage repair (SLDR) in AGO1522 cells is reduced under half-field exposure; (iii) the yield of initial DNA lesions measured with half-field exposure is smaller than that with uniform-field exposure. These results suggest that increased cell survival under half-field exposure is predominantly attributed not to rescue effects (increased SLDR) but protective effects (reduced induction of initial DNA lesions). In support of these protective effects, the reduced DNA damage leads to modulation of cell-cycle dynamics, i.e., less G1 arrest 6 h after irradiation. These findings provide a new understanding of the impact of dose-rate effects and protective effects measured after modulated field irradiation.""","""['Yusuke Matsuya', 'Stephen J McMahon', 'Mihaela Ghita', 'Yuji Yoshii', 'Tatsuhiko Sato', 'Hiroyuki Date', 'Kevin M Prise']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Sci Rep""","""['Modelling oxygen effects on the in- and out-of-field radiosensitivity of cells exposed to intensity-modulated radiation fields.', 'Out-of-field cell survival following exposure to intensity-modulated radiation fields.', 'A computational model of cellular response to modulated radiation fields.', 'The ESTRO Breur lecture.

The premise of radiomics is that quantitative image-based features can serve as biomarkers for detecting and characterizing disease. For such biomarkers to be useful, repeatability is a basic requirement, meaning its value must remain stable between two scans, if the conditions remain stable. We investigated repeatability of radiomics features under various preprocessing and extraction configurations including various image normalization schemes, different image pre-filtering, and different bin widths for image discretization. Although we found many radiomics features and preprocessing combinations with high repeatability (Intraclass Correlation Coefficient > 0.85), our results indicate that overall the repeatability is highly sensitive to the processing parameters. Neither image normalization, using a variety of approaches, nor the use of pre-filtering options resulted in consistent improvements in repeatability. We urge caution when interpreting radiomics features and advise paying close attention to the processing configuration details of reported results.

Aberrant Wnt3a signals promotes cancer progression through accumulation of β-Catenin. Here we investigated a potential role for TRAF6 in Wnt signaling.  Methods:   TRAF6 expression was silenced by siRNA in human prostate cancer (PC3U) and human colorectal SW480 cells and by CRISPR/Cas9 in zebrafish. Several biochemical methods and analyses of mutant phenotype in zebrafish were used to analyse the function of TRAF6 in Wnt signaling.  Findings:   Wnt3a-treatment promoted binding of TRAF6 to the Wnt co-receptors LRP5/LRP6 in PC3U and LNCaP cells in vitro. TRAF6 positively regulated mRNA expression of β-Catenin and subsequent activation of Wnt target genes in PC3U cells. Wnt3a-induced invasion of PC3U and SW480 cells were significantly reduced when TRAF6 was silenced by siRNA. Database analysis revealed a correlation between TRAF6 mRNA and Wnt target genes in patients with prostate cancer, and high expression of LRP5, TRAF6 and c-Myc correlated with poor prognosis. By using CRISPR/Cas9 to silence TRAF6 in zebrafish, we confirm TRAF6 as a key molecule in Wnt3a signaling for expression of Wnt target genes.  Interpretation:   We identify TRAF6 as an important component in Wnt3a signaling to promote activation of Wnt target genes, a finding important for understanding mechanisms driving prostate cancer progression.

We evaluated the tumor tissue expression of downstream mTOR targets in patients with intermediate- and high-risk (IR/HR) PCa and their ability to predict outcome after radical prostatectomy (RP).  Patients and methods:   Immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis using antibodies against PTEN, mTOR, p-mTOR, pAKT, pS6, and Ki-67 was performed on a tissue microarray constructed from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded RP specimens. The marker expression was analyzed to determine their predictability for biochemical recurrence (BCR).  Results:   Tumor tissue from 217 patients (86 IR/131 HR) was analyzed. The most frequent markers were p-mTOR, which was expressed in most cases (85%), whereas PTEN and pS6 were detected in 53% and 40% of the cases, respectively. Overexpression of PTEN (P = .02) and pS6 (P < .001) was associated with HR features. With a median follow up of 13.5 years, 39% (77/196) of patients developed BCR after RP, more frequently (31%) in patients with HR disease (P < .001). Overexpression of pS6 (P = .036), Ki67% (P = .024), and lack of expression of mTOR (P = .021) were associated with BCR. The 5- and 10-year survival rate was 81% and 66%, respectively.

Thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) has been reported to be related to prostate cancer. Nonetheless, the association between prostate cancer and MN and TMA has not been well established.  Case report:   A 73-year-old man presented with nephritic syndrome 40 days after implantation of iodine-125 seed for stage II T2N0M0 prostatic carcinoma. The prostatic-specific antigen (PSA) was normalized, and the tumor disappeared after the initial brachytherapy. The circulating autoantibody to phospholipase A2 receptor (PLA2R) and thrombospondin type 1 domain containing 7A (THSD7A) was undetectable. Kidney biopsy revealed MN and TMA in glomerulus. Staining of PLA2R, THSD7A, prostate-specific membrane antigen, and prostate acid phosphatase in glomeruli were all negative. The diagnosis of MN and TMA was made, and a combination of steroid therapy and tacrolimus was prescribed. Two weeks after immunosuppressive treatment with prednisone 30 mg/d and tacrolimus 2 mg/d, the patient achieved partial remission in terms of proteinuria.

However, the use of PL is limited in the clinic because of its hydrophobic nature. In this study, chitosan- and fucoidan-based nanoparticles were prepared for the effective intracellular delivery of PL into cancer cells. Chitosan and fucoidan formed nanoparticles by ionic gelation. The chitosan- and fucoidan-based nanoparticles (CS-F NPs) effectively encapsulated PL, and increased its water solubility and bioavailability. CS-F NPs showed very low cytotoxicity in human prostate cancer cells, demonstrating its high potential for in vivo applications. The PL-loaded chitosan-fucoidan nanoparticles (PL-CS-F NPs) efficiently killed human prostate cancer cells via PL-induced intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation.

To determine the effectiveness of these ligands, the internalised fraction over time is derived from cell studies. Parameters, such as the ligand concentration and the number of cells, are experiment-specific and therefore a comparison between ligands is difficult. A more objective approach that allows better comparison is desirable. Therefore, the aim of this work was to develop a compartmental model that fully describes all relevant pharmacokinetic interactions of PSMA-specific ligands with prostate cancer cells.  Methods:   Internalisation studies were performed using the lymph node carcinoma of the prostate cell line LNCaP C4-2 and the prostatic carcinoma cell line PC-3. A new protocol was established for the determination of the PSMA-binding specificity by surface plasmon resonance (SPR). The experimental data in combination with parameters from literature were used for the modelling approach.  Results:   A compartmental model which includes the relevant physiological mechanisms was developed. The basic model structure and some parameters originate from the literature. The PSMA-specific association and dissociation rates of Ga-PSMA-11 were measured using surface plasmon resonance technology. The ligand-induced internalisation and PSMA synthesis rates were estimated by fitting the developed model to experimental data obtained using LNCaP C4-2 cells. For all [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 concentrations and including four various incubation times, the ligand-induced internalisation was determined to be (3.6 ± 0.1) % min-1.  Conclusions:   The presented approach is a prerequisite for better estimation and thus comparison of important ligand-cell interaction parameters, by combining SPR measurements, cell experiments and mathematical modelling.

Higher neuroticism was linked to higher odds of colorectal screening, and conscientiousness moderated the link between neuroticism and cervical screening. These associations were significant in models that accounted for demographic and socioeconomic factors. The effect sizes were in the range of a 10-20% higher likelihood of cancer screening for 1 SD difference in personality. The present findings suggest that conscientiousness and extraversion were related to preventive cancer screenings, whereas neuroticism, openness and agreeableness were largely unrelated to the likelihood of such screenings. If these results are further replicated, health policy makers may consider personality traits when planning and implementing screening recommendations to improve preventive medicine.""","""['Damaris Aschwanden', 'Mary A Gerend', 'Martina Luchetti', 'Yannick Stephan', 'Angelina R Sutin', 'Antonio Terracciano']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Prev Med""","""['An Economic Perspective on Personality Traits and Alcohol Misuse: Evidence from the Health and Retirement Study.', 'Five-factor model personality traits and grip strength: Meta-analysis of seven studies.', 'Personality and the use of cancer screenings.

We also sought to propose new age-specific PSA reference ranges to improve the diagnosis and prognosis of PC.  Methods:   In order to address our objectives, a PSA statistical analysis of 16,305 Puerto Rican men (from 2004-2012) with proven PC was carried out.  Results:   For all Puerto Rican PC patients, PSA statistical central measures and variability were determined. For instance, the mean, median, mode, index of dispersion (ID), and interquartile range (IQR) had the values 16.9 ng/mL, 7.2 ng/mL, 4.5 ng/mL, 3.1 ng/mL, and 11.3 ng/mL, respectively. The ID values suggest significant PSA data variability, and the IQR values show that the PSA data are over-dispersed. We found the median age specific PSA reference ranges and confidence interval (CI) for all Puerto Rican men with proven PC. Also, we obtained the median PSA level and CI of Puerto Rican men with proven PC in 2 ranges (0<PSA<4 ng/mL) and (4 ng/mL<PSA<98 ng/mL).

A subset of castration resistant prostate cancers become androgen receptor (AR) signaling-independent and develop neuroendocrine prostate cancer (NEPC) features through lineage plasticity. These NEPC tumors, associated with aggressive disease and poor prognosis, are driven, in part, by aberrant expression of N-Myc, through mechanisms that remain unclear. Integrative analysis of the N-Myc transcriptome, cistrome and interactome using in vivo, in vitro and ex vivo models (including patient-derived organoids) identified a lineage switch towards a neural identity associated with epigenetic reprogramming. N-Myc and known AR-co-factors (e.g., FOXA1 and HOXB13) overlapped, independently of AR, at genomic loci implicated in neural lineage specification. Moreover, histone marks specifically associated with lineage-defining genes were reprogrammed by N-Myc. We also demonstrated that the N-Myc-induced molecular program accurately classifies our cohort of patients with advanced prostate cancer. Finally, we revealed the potential for EZH2 inhibition to reverse the N-Myc-induced suppression of epithelial lineage genes. Altogether, our data provide insights on how N-Myc regulates lineage plasticity and epigenetic reprogramming associated with lineage-specification. The N-Myc signature we defined could also help predict the evolution of prostate cancer and thus better guide the choice of future therapeutic strategies.""","""['Adeline Berger', 'Nicholas J Brady', 'Rohan Bareja', 'Brian Robinson', 'Vincenza Conteduca', 'Michael A Augello', 'Loredana Puca', 'Adnan Ahmed', 'Etienne Dardenne', 'Xiaodong Lu', 'Inah Hwang', 'Alyssa M Bagadion', 'Andrea Sboner', 'Olivier Elemento', 'Jihye Paik', 'Jindan Yu', 'Christopher E Barbieri', 'Noah Dephoure', 'Himisha Beltran', 'David S Rickman']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""J Clin Invest""","""['N-Myc a key gene promoting a worst prostate cancer progression.', 'N-Myc-mediated epigenetic reprogramming in advanced prostate cancer: personalized medicine and quality of biological samples.', 'N-Myc Induces an EZH2-Mediated Transcriptional Program Driving Neuroendocrine Prostate Cancer.', 'MUC1-C regulates lineage plasticity driving progression to neuroendocrine prostate cancer.', 'Temporal evolution of cellular heterogeneity during the progression to advanced AR-negative prostate cancer.', 'The Role of Epigenetic Change in Therapy-Induced Neuroendocrine Prostate Cancer Lineage Plasticity.', 'Epigenetic modulations and lineage plasticity in advanced prostate cancer.', 'The Identification of CELSR3 and Other Potential Cell Surface Targets in Neuroendocrine Prostate Cancer.', 'Lineage plasticity and treatment resistance in prostate cancer: the intersection of genetics, epigenetics, and evolution.', ""Targeting Prostate Cancer, the 'Tousled Way'."", 'Distinct mesenchymal cell states mediate prostate cancer progression.', 'Inhibitors of the Oncogenic PA2G4-MYCN Protein-Protein Interface.']"""

To interfere with this newly discovered FABP5-related signalling pathway, we have produced a highly efficient recombinant FABP5 inhibitor, named dmrFABP5. Treatment with dmrFABP5 significantly supressed the proliferation, migration, invasion and colony formation of the highly malignant prostate cancer cells PC3-M in vitro. To test dmrFABP5's suppressive effect in CRPC, the human PC3-M cells were implanted orthotopically into the prostate gland of immunosuppressed mice to produce tumours. These mice were then treated with dmrFABP5 and produced a highly significant reduction of 100% in metastatic rate and a highly significant reduction of 13-fold in the average size of primary tumours. Immunocytochemial staining showed that the staining intensity of dmrFABP5 treated tumours was reduced by 67%. When tested in vitro, dmrFABP5 suppressed the cancer cells by blocking fatty acid stimulation of PPARγ, and thereby prevented it activating down-stream cancer-promoting or inhibiting cancer-suppressing genes.

Subject and methods:   The estimates of the incidence and mortality of prostate cancer for 87 countries were obtained from the Global Burden of Disease 2016 study for the period 1990 to 2016. The human development level of a country was measured using its human development index (HDI): a summary indicator of health, education, and income. The association between the burden of prostate cancer and the human development index (HDI) was measured using pairwise correlation and bivariate regression. Mortality-to-incidence ratio (MIR) was employed as a proxy for the survival rate of prostate cancer.  Results:   Globally, 1.4 million new cases of prostate cancer arose in 2016 claiming 380,916 lives which more than doubled from 579,457 incident cases and 191,687 deaths in 1990. In 2016, the age-standardised incidence rate (ASIR) was the highest in very high-HDI countries led by Australia with ASIR of 174.1/100,000 and showed a strong positive association with HDI (r = 0.66); the age-standardised mortality rate (ASMR), however, was higher in low-HDI countries led by Zimbabwe with ASMR of 78.2/100,000 in 2016. Global MIR decreased from 0.33 in 1990 to 0.26 in 2016. Mortality-to-incidence ratio (MIR) exhibited a negative gradient (r = - 0.91) with human development index with tenfold variation globally with seven countries recording MIR in excess of 1 with the USA recording the minimum MIR of 0.10.  Conclusion:   The high mortality and lower survival rates in less-developed countries demand all-inclusive solutions ranging from cost-effective early screening and detection to cost-effective cancer treatment. In tackling the rising burden of prostate cancer predictive, preventive and personalised medicine (PPPM) can play a useful role through prevention strategies, predicting PCa more precisely and accurately using a multiomic approach and risk-stratifying patients to provide personalised medicine.""","""['Rajesh Sharma']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""EPMA J""","""['Mapping Cancer in Africa: A Comprehensive and Comparable Characterization of 34 Cancer Types Using Estimates From GLOBOCAN 2020.', 'An examination of colorectal cancer burden by socioeconomic status: evidence from GLOBOCAN 2018.', 'Oral Cancer Incidence, Mortality, and Mortality-to-Incidence Ratio Are Associated with Human Development Index in China, 1990-2019.', 'Prostate cancer management: long-term beliefs, epidemic developments in the early twenty-first century and 3PM dimensional solutions.', 'Tuberculosis.', 'Prostate Cancer: From Molecular Imaging to Immunological and Target Therapies.', 'The Economic Burden of Localized Prostate Cancer and Insights Derived from Cost-Effectiveness Studies of the Different Treatments.', 'Gastric cancer incidence, mortality and burden in adolescents and young adults: a time-trend analysis and comparison among China, South Korea, Japan and the USA.', 'Mapping Cancer in Africa: A Comprehensive and Comparable Characterization of 34 Cancer Types Using Estimates From GLOBOCAN 2020.', 'The Effectiveness of Pelvic Floor Muscle Training in Men after Radical Prostatectomy Measured with the Insert Test.']"""

Herein, ultrathin manganese dioxide (MnO2) nanosheets with broad near-infrared (NIR) absorption and pH-dependent degradation properties were prepared. After being modified with polyethylene glycol-cyclic arginine-glycineaspartic acid tripeptide (PEG-cRGD), the MnO2 nanosheets were then used as photothermal agent and nanocarrier to encapsulate chlorin e6 (Ce6) for targeted photothermal (PTT) and photodynamic (PDT) of cancer. As expected, the MnO2-PEG-cRGD nanosheets show high Ce6 loading capacity (351 mg/g), superb photothermal conversion performance (37.2%) and excellent colloidal stability. These nanosheets also exhibit pH-dependent and NIR-induced Ce6 release. Furthermore, the MnO2 nanosheets can be degraded by reacting with hydrogen peroxide in the acidic microenvironment, which are able to elevate the oxygen concentration in situ and thus reverses the tumor hypoxia. Thanks to these favorable properties and the cRGD-mediated tumor-targeted ability, the fabricated MnO2-PEG-cRGD/Ce6 nanocomposites can be effectively up taken by alpha-v beta-3 (αvβ3) integrin over-expressed prostatic carcinoma PC3 cells and achieve favorable therapeutic outcomes under a single 660 nm NIR laser, which is also verified by in vitro studies.

High‑throughput RNA sequencing and bioinformatics analysis of samples from six pairs of patients treated with or without acupuncture and moxibustion were conducted. The reliability of high‑throughput RNA sequencing was validated using reverse transcription‑quantitative PCR. The most significant circRNA functions and pathways were selected by gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analyses. A circRNA‑miR‑mRNA interaction network was constructed to determine the connection between circRNAs, microRNAs (miRs), and mRNAs. High‑throughput RNA sequencing identified 2,653 circRNAs. A total of 86 circRNAs was differentially expressed, of which 57 were upregulated and 29 were downregulated, between the acupuncture and moxibustion group and the control group. In the GO analysis, the identified BP terms were chromatin modification, positive regulation of transcription from RNA polymerase II promoter involved in unfolded protein response, oxidative DNA demethylation, regulation of transcription from RNA polymerase II promoter in response to hypoxia, and regulation of smooth muscle cell differentiation. The identified CC terms were nucleoplasm, nucleolus, nucleus, histone acetyltransferase complex, and annulate lamellae. The identified MF terms were methylcytosine dioxygenase activity, chromatin binding, zinc ion binding, histone binding, and protein binding. In the KEGG pathway analysis, the identified pathways were protein processing in endoplasmic reticulum, degradation of aromatic compounds, shigellosis, mTOR signaling pathway, bacterial invasion of epithelial cells, and prostate cancer.

To reduce the risk, it is important to delete the cancer stem-like cells. Furthermore, to induce differentiation of cancer stem-like cells is critical to abrogate stemness of the cells. Therefore, we tried to investigate a possibility on the establishment of a new effective therapy to eradicate the cancer stem-like cells via the induction of differentiation in this study. Prostate cancer stem-like cells from an androgen-dependent prostate cancer cell line (LNCaP cell) had severe resistance against an anti-androgen therapeutic agent. We selected Bowman-Birk inhibitor (BBI) from soybeans reported as a chemopreventive agent in prostate cancer to differentiate the caner stem-like cells and α-tocopheryl succinate (TOS) known as a mitocan to induce effectively cytotoxic effect against the cancer stem-like cells. In fact, only TOS treatment had cytotoxic effect against the cancer stem-like cells, but the addition of BBI treatment to the cells treated with TOS reinforced TOS-mediated cytotoxicity in the cancer stem-like cells. This reinforcement coincided with the combination-enhanced apoptosis in the stem-like cells. Also, we confirmed caspase9-caspase3 cascade mainly contributed to the enhancement of the cytotoxicity in the stem-like cells caused by the combination, indicating that the reinforcement of BBI on TOS-mediated apoptosis via mitochondria related to the enhancing cytotoxic effect of the combination on the prostate cancer stem-like cells. Overall, it seems that the combination is an effective new approach to reduce the reoccurrence of prostate cancer targeting prostate cancer stem cells.""","""['Saki Kaneko', 'Takumi Yamazaki', 'Kakeru Kohno', 'Ayami Sato', 'Kazunori Kato', 'Tomohiro Yano']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""J Nutr Sci Vitaminol (Tokyo)""","""['Induction of apoptosis in the LNCaP human prostate carcinoma cell line and prostate adenocarcinomas of SV40T antigen transgenic rats by the Bowman-Birk inhibitor.', 'Effects of the Bowman-Birk inhibitor on growth, invasion, and clonogenic survival of human prostate epithelial cells and prostate cancer cells.', 'Effects of the Bowman-Birk protease inhibitor on survival of fibroblasts and cancer cells exposed to radiation and cis-platinum.', 'The role of alpha tocopheryl succinate (α-TOS) as a potential anticancer agent.', 'Biological significance of polymorphism in legume protease inhibitors from the Bowman-Birk family.', 'Bowman-Birk Inhibitors: Insights into Family of Multifunctional Proteins and Peptides with Potential Therapeutical Applications.']"""

Furthermore, we aimed to evaluate if follow-up by MRI has an incremental value compared to the standard care by prostate-specific antigen (PSA) serum level measurement.  Materials and methods:   Fifty-five men (mean age: 70±5 [SD] years; range: 60-79 years) with biopsy-proven PCa underwent MRI examination before radiotherapy, and at 3 and 12 months after radiotherapy. Pharmacokinetic analysis post-processing platform with dedicated software (Tissue 4D) was used to generate colorized parametric maps of enhancing tumors. The volume transfer constant (Ktrans), reflux constant (Kep), and initial area under curve (iAUC) were calculated from the tumors. Tumor apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) value was measured on the ADC map. The patients were allocated into three radiotherapy groups: 17 conventional (39×2Gy), 16 moderate (20×3Gy) and 22 extreme hypofractionated (5×7.25Gy) regimen.  Results:   Sixty lesions were detected in the prostates of the 55 patients. Follow-up MRI showed decreases in tumor size and degree of enhancement. Ktrans, Kep, and iAUC all decreased at 3 months (P<0.001, respectively) and decreased further at 12 months (P<0.001, respectively). ADC increased at 3 months (P<0.001) and increased further at 12 months (P<0.001). There were no significant differences in the percentage changes of the measured MP-MRI parameters of the tumors from baseline to 12 months between the conventional, moderate and extreme hypofractionated regimen groups.

Patients and methods:   Using the Shared Equal Access Regional Cancer Hospital database, we identified men after radical prostatectomy with PSA > 0.2 ng/mL and without cancer involvement of lymph nodes who underwent SRT alone. SRT failure was defined as post-SRT PSA nadir + 0.2 ng/mL or receipt of post-SRT hormone therapy. Men were stratified by pre-SRT PSA (0.2-0.49, 0.5-0.99, and ≥ 1.0 ng/mL). Multivariable Cox models were used to test the association between pre-SRT PSA and SRT failure, stratified by PGG.  Results:   A total of 358 men met the inclusion criteria and comprised our study cohort. Median post-SRT follow-up was 78 months. A total of 174 men (49%) had pre-SRT PSA 0.2-0.49 ng/mL, 97 (27%) PSA 0.5-0.99 ng/mL, and 87 (24%) PSA ≥ 1.0 ng/mL. On multivariable analysis among men with PGG 1-2, pre-SRT PSA 0.2-0.49 ng/mL had similar outcomes as PSA 0.5-0.99 ng/mL; those with PSA ≥ 1.0 ng/mL had higher recurrence risks (hazard ratio = 2.78, P < .001).

Methods:   In the current study, a population-based cohort of 835 men with newly diagnosed prostate cancer from 2011 through 2013 was recruited throughout North Carolina in collaboration with the Rapid Case Ascertainment system of the North Carolina Central Cancer Registry. All men were enrolled prior to treatment and followed prospectively using the validated Prostate Cancer Symptom Indices (PCSI) instrument. This analysis compares the sexual dysfunction scores of the PCSI among patients who received external-beam RT (EBRT), EBRT with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), brachytherapy, nerve-sparing radical prostatectomy (RP), and non-nerve-sparing RP. Propensity scores were used to balance patient characteristics across groups, and multiple imputation was used for missing data.  Results:   EBRT and brachytherapy resulted in similar PCSI scores through 24 months. Compared with those receiving EBRT, patients treated with EBRT with ADT and RP with or without nerve sparing were found to have worse PCSI scores at all posttreatment time points. Preservation of useful sexual function at 24 months was associated with treatment type, baseline score, and age. Predicted preservation rates were 14.1% to 70.7% for EBRT, 8.4% to 52.3% for EBRT with ADT, 4.7% to 45.3% for nerve-sparing RP, and 4.8% to 34.5% for non-nerve-sparing RP.  Conclusions:   The findings of the current study indicate that RT alone results in the best preservation of sexual function, and brachytherapy provides similar outcomes. RT with ADT and nerve-sparing RP yielded similar outcomes, whereas patients treated with non-nerve-sparing RP experienced the worst sexual function. These results help patients to make decisions among the specific types of surgery and RT they face based on each individual's diagnosis.""","""['Brandon T Mullins', 'Ramsankar Basak', 'James R Broughman', 'Ronald C Chen']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Cancer""","""['Association Between Choice of Radical Prostatectomy, External Beam Radiotherapy, Brachytherapy, or Active Surveillance and Patient-Reported Quality of Life Among Men With Localized Prostate Cancer.', 'Patient-Reported Outcomes Through 5 Years for Active Surveillance, Surgery, Brachytherapy, or External Beam Radiation With or Without Androgen Deprivation Therapy for Localized Prostate Cancer.', 'Association Between Radiation Therapy, Surgery, or Observation for Localized Prostate Cancer and Patient-Reported Outcomes After 3 Years.', 'A systematic review of randomised controlled trials of radiotherapy for localised prostate cancer.', 'Quality of Life Outcomes after Primary Treatment for Clinically Localised Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Review.', 'Effect of Brachytherapy vs. External Beam Radiotherapy on Sexual Function in Patients With Clinically Localized Prostate Cancer: A Meta-Analysis.', 'Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Health Status, Chronic Conditions, and Behavioral Risk Factors Among Prostate Cancer Survivors, United States, 2015.', 'Erectile dysfunction and cancer: current perspective.', 'Development of Prostate Cancer Organoid Culture Models in Basic Medicine and Translational Research.']"""

The synthesized nanoparticles were crystalline, quasi-spherical in shape and their average size ranged from 65.0 to 86.7 nm. In our radical scavenging assays, the nanoparticles have revealed a strong antioxidant activity with respective standard ascorbic acid. The nanoparticles also exhibited a wide bactericidal action on pathogens namely Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Shigella flexneri and Escherichia coli. At 75 μg/ml concentration, the nanoparticles showed the highest inhibition against S. aureus (16.2 ± 0.45 mm), the lowest zone of inhibition was seen against K. pneumoniae (12.3 ± 0.50 mm) and moderate inhibition on other strains. Further, its cytotoxicity was seen as effective against DU145 and PC3 cells.

Methods and materials:   Patients received 79.29 Gy (n = 78; R1/detectable tumors) or 71.43 Gy (n = 56; R0/undetectable tumors) equivalent dose in 2-Gy fractions (EQD-2). Out of 134 patients, 51 had received additional WPRT with 44 Gy. Decision regret was reported using a 5-item instrument (best/worst scores: 0-100); European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer QLQ-C30 and QLQ-PR25 questionnaires were used for HRQOL evaluation.  Results:   At a median follow-up of 53 months, 134 valid questionnaires were returned. Most patients had locally advanced, node-positive (T3-4/N0 = 54.5%; N1 = 17.2%) or high-risk tumors (27.6%). Mean DR surgery was 17.61 and not associated with positive margins, salvage strategy, or radiation therapy regimen. Mean DR radiation therapy was 18.64 and better in patients who had PBRT compared with WPRT (P = .034; 24.39 vs. 15.24). Patient-reported bowel and urinary symptoms were worse after WPRT compared with PBRT (both P < .05); general HRQOL was numerically but not significantly better after PBRT without WPRT (P = .055). Subset analyses identified increased bowel and urinary symptom scores after WPRT irrespective of higher or lower dose cohorts (all P < .05).  Conclusions:   WPRT was associated with increased symptom burden and decision regret compared with PBRT. It is uncertain if the results can be extrapolated to lower-dose (<70 Gy) regimens.

Both epididymal tissue and blood samples were collected during surgery, and the drug concentrations were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography. All concentration-time data were analyzed with a three-compartment model with first-order absorption and elimination processes to simulate AZM concentrations in serum and epididymal tissue.  Results:   A total of 10 patients were enrolled in the current study. For the observed values, the ratio of the epididymal concentration to the serum concentration was 5.13 ± 3.71 (mean ± standard deviation). For the simulated values, the maximum concentrations were 0.64 μg/mL at 2.42 h in serum and 1.96 μg/g at 4.10 h in epididymal tissue. The 24-h concentrations were 0.239 μg/mL in serum and 0.795 μg/g in epididymal tissue.  Conclusions:   The penetration of oral AZM into human epididymal tissue was examined to assess the potential application of AZM for the treatment of acute epididymitis. Based on the previous reports mentioning drug-susceptibility of C. trachomatis, multiple doses of oral AZM 1 g would be recommended for epididymitis based on the site-specific PK/PD.""","""['Takuya Sadahira', 'Koichiro Wada', 'Kazuro Ikawa', 'Norifumi Morikawa', 'Masao Mitsui', 'Motoo Araki', 'Masachika Fujiyoshi', 'Ayano Ishii', 'Masami Watanabe', 'Toyohiko Watanabe', 'Yasutomo Nasu']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""J Infect Chemother""","""['Clinical pharmacokinetics of oral levofloxacin and sitafloxacin in\xa0epididymal tissue.', 'Pharmacokinetics of a single 1g dose of azithromycin in rectal tissue in men.', 'Clinical pharmacokinetics and gastrointestinal tolerability of a novel extended-release microsphere formulation of azithromycin.', '¿Azitromicina como tratamiento contra Chlamydia trachomatis?.', 'Azithromycin.

One out of eight men will be stricken with this disease during the course of his life. It is noteworthy that, at initial diagnoses 80-90% of cancers are androgen dependent. Hence, the androgen receptor is a viable biological target to be considered for drug targeting. We have developed a new generation of testosterone-Pt(II) hybrids for site-specific treatment of hormone-dependent prostate cancer. The hybrid molecules are made from testosterone using an eight-step reaction sequence with about 7% overall yield. They are linked with a stronger tether chain between the testosterone moiety and the Pt(II) moiety in comparison to our first generation hybrids. The new hybrids were tested on hormone-dependent and -independent prostate cancer cell lines. The hybrid 3a presents the best antiproliferative activity and was selective on hormone-dependent prostate cancer with IC50 of 2.2 μM on LNCaP (AR+) in comparison to 13.3 μM on PC3 (AR-) and 8.8 μM on DU145 (AR-) prostate cancer cells. On the same cell lines, CDDP displayed IC50 of 2.1 μM, 0.5 μM and 1.0 μM, respectively. Remarkably, hybrid 3a was inactive on both colon carcinoma (HT-29) and normal human adult keratinocyte cells (HaCat) with an IC50 of >25 μM. This is not the case for CDDP showing IC50 of 1.3 μM and 5.1 μM on HT-29 and HaCat cells, respectively. The potential for selective activity on androgen-receptor positive prostate cancer cells is confirmed with hybrid 3a giving new hope for an efficient and less toxic platinum-based treatment of prostate cancer patients.""","""['Vincent Ouellette', 'Marie-France Côté', 'René C Gaudreault', 'Heidar-Ali Tajmir-Riahi', 'Gervais Bérubé']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Eur J Med Chem""","""['New platinum(II) complexes conjugated at position 7α of 17β-acetyl-testosterone as new combi-molecules against prostate cancer: design, synthesis, structure-activity relationships and biological evaluation.', 'Theranostic Pt(IV) Conjugate with Target Selectivity for Androgen Receptor.', 'Synthesis and preliminary in vitro biological evaluation of 7α-testosterone-chlorambucil hybrid designed for the treatment of prostate cancer.', 'Anticancer platinum(II) complexes bearing N-heterocycle rings.', 'Metal-based drugs.']"""

The CA scaffolds are a 3D culture platform that supports PCa growth and phenotypic expression with adjustable scaffold stiffness to mimic stages of metastatic progression.

However, their molecular mechanisms are still unclear. In this study, we examined the effects of these drugs in chemoresistant rectal cancer cell lines. We found that SW837 and SW1463 rectal cancer cells were more resistant to ionizing radiation and 5-fluorouracil than HCT116 and LS513 colon cancer cells. In addition, metformin and phenformin increased the sensitivity of these cell lines by inhibiting cell proliferation, suppressing clonogenic ability and increasing apoptotic cell death in rectal cancer cells. Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 and transforming growth factor-β/Smad signaling pathways were more activated in rectal cancer cells, and inhibition of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 expression using an inhibitor or siRNA sensitized rectal cancer cells to chemoresistant by inhibition of the expression of antiapoptotic proteins, such as X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis, survivin and cellular inhibitor of apoptosis protein 1. Moreover, metformin and phenformin inhibited cell migration and invasion by suppression of transforming growth factor β receptor 2-mediated Snail and Twist expression in rectal cancer cells.

Thirty-three hospitals implemented one out of the three DAs in routine care. Implementation rates for each DA were calculated per hospital. After deciding about PCa treatment, patients (n = 1033) completed a survey on pre-formulated barriers and facilitators to use a DA. Overall DA implementation was 40%. For each DA alike, implementation within hospitals varied from incidental (< 10% of eligible patients receiving a DA) to high rates of implementation (> 80%).

Importantly, miR-214 overexpression in prostate cancer cells induced apoptosis, inhibiting cell proliferation and colony forming ability. miR-214 expression in prostate cancer cells also inhibited cell migration and 3D spheroid invasion. Mechanistically, miR-214 inhibited prostate cancer cell proliferation by targeting protein tyrosine kinase 6 (PTK6). Restoration of PTK6 expression attenuated the inhibitory effect of miR-214 on cell proliferation.

TPD52 expression increases lipid storage in mouse 3T3 fibroblasts, and co-distributes with the Golgi marker GM130 and lipid droplets (LDs). We examined the effects of Brefeldin A (BFA), a fungal metabolite known to disrupt the Golgi structure, in TPD52-expressing 3T3 cells, and in human AU565 and HMC-1-8 breast cancer cells that endogenously express TPD52. Five-hour BFA treatment reduced median LD numbers, but increased LD sizes. TPD52 knockdown decreased both LD sizes and numbers, and blunted BFA's effects on LD numbers. Following BFA treatment for 1-3 hours, TPD52 co-localised with the trans-Golgi network protein syntaxin 6, but after 5 hours BFA treatment, TPD52 showed increased co-localisation with LDs, which was disrupted by microtubule depolymerising agent nocodazole. BFA treatment also increased perilipin (PLIN) family protein PLIN3 but reduced PLIN2 detection at LDs in TPD52-expressing 3T3 cells, with PLIN3 recruitment to LDs preceding that of TPD52. An N-terminally deleted HA-TPD52 mutant (residues 40-184) almost exclusively targeted to LDs in both vehicle and BFA treated cells.

HCS prevalence among diverse probands seeking genetic evaluation with PCa family history (FHx) has not been reported and has implications for cascade genetic testing.  Objective:   To evaluate the rates of HCSs among probands reporting PCa FHx and germline mutations among probands.  Design, setting, and participants:   A prospective genetic testing database queried for individuals with PCa FHx. Pedigrees analyzed for three HCSs: hereditary breast and ovarian cancer (HBOC), hereditary PCa, and Lynch syndrome.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Associations between HCS overall, and with plausible link to PCA FHx and race evaluated using Fisher's exact test. Germline mutation rates described among probands with a suspicion of an HCS connected with PCa FHx.  Results and limitations:   A total of 345 probands reported PCa FHx: 53 African American (AA) and 292 Caucasian (Wh). Overall, 220 probands (63.8%) met the criteria for at least one HCS with a potential link to PCa FHx (75.5% AA; 61.6% Wh). HBOC linked to PCa FHx was identified in a higher percentage of AA than Wh probands (90.2% vs 74.6%, p=0.04). Among probands who underwent genetic testing with any HCS potentially linked to PCa FHx (n=169), 19.5% had germline mutations identified; five AA probands had germline mutations (all in BRCA1/2), while 28 Wh probands had mutations in a spectrum of genes.  Conclusions:   A significant percentage of AA probands with PCa FHx meet the criteria for HCSs, with HBOC identified at the highest rate. Although limited in sample size, our findings implicate BRCA mutations in AA families with HCSs linked with PCa, underscoring the need for greater enrollment of AA participants in genetic studies.

Aim:   To test a novel psychological intervention based on Acceptance and Commitment Therapy for erectile dysfunction (ACT-ED) to help men utilize penile injections.  Methods:   This pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) recruited men who were beginning a standard care (SC) structured penile rehabilitation program following radical prostatectomy. The SC program instructed patients to use penile injections 2 to 3 times per week. Participants were randomized to SC+ACT-ED or SC+enhanced monitoring (EM). Over 4 months, patients in the SC+ACT-ED group received SC plus 4 ACT sessions and 3 ACT phone calls; those in the EM group received SC plus 7 phone calls from an experienced sexual medicine nurse practitioner. Participants were assessed at study entry and at 4 and 8 months. For this pilot study, the goal was to determine initial efficacy (ie, effect sizes, where d = 0.2 is small, d = 0.5 is medium, and d = 0.8 is large).  Main outcome measure:   Primary outcomes were feasibility and use of penile injections. Secondary outcomes were ED treatment satisfaction (ie, Erectile Dysfunction Inventory of Treatment Satisfaction, or EDITS), sexual Self-Esteem and Relationship (SEAR) quality, sexual bother (SB), and prostate cancer treatment regret.  Results:   The 53 participants were randomized (ACT, n = 26; EM, n = 27). The study acceptance rate was 61%. At 4 months, the ACT-ED group utilized more penile injections per week (1.7) compared to the EM group (0.9) (d = 1.25; P = .001) and was more adherent to penile rehabilitation compared to the EM group (ACT, 44%; EM, 10%; relative risk [RR], 4.4; P = .02). These gains were maintained at 8 months for injections per week (ACT, 1.2; EM, 0.7; d = 1.08; P = .03) and approached significance for adherence (ACT, 18%; EM, 0%; P = .10). At 4 months, ACT-ED, compared to EM, reported moderate effects for greater satisfaction with ED treatment (d = 0.41; P = .22), greater sexual self-esteem (d = 0.54; P = .07) and sexual confidence (d = 0.48; P = .07), lower sexual bother (d = 0.43; P = .17), and lower prostate cancer treatment regret (d = 0.74; P = .02). At 8 months, moderate effects in favor of ACT-ED were maintained for greater sexual self-esteem (d = 0.40; P = .19) and less treatment regret (d = 0.47; P = .16).  Clinical implications:   ACT concepts may help men utilize penile injections and cope with the effects of ED.  Strengths and limitations:   Strengths include use of an innovative intervention utilizing ACT concepts and pilot RCT. Limitations include the pilot nature of the study (eg, small samples size, lack of statistical power).  Conclusion:   ACT-ED is feasible and significantly increases the use of penile injections.

Objective:   To develop and evaluate an educational intervention in terms of adherence to AS among men with low- to intermediate-risk PC.  Design, setting, and participants:   We first carried out focus group discussions with men who had remained on and dropped out of AS to inform an intervention to increase adherence to AS. A total of 255 consecutive men who had selected AS were then recruited to either standard care (written information and access to a nurse specialist) or standard care and the intervention.  Intervention:   An educational seminar was designed by patients and clinicians including information on imaging, biopsy techniques, understanding pathology, large AS cohorts - mortality and morbidity risk and diet and lifestyle advice.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   The proportion of men dropping out of AS for reasons other than disease progression was assessed at 1 and 5yr after AS selection using multivariate logistic regression.  Results and limitations:   Common themes influencing decision-making by men on AS were identified: (1) clinical consistency; (2) information; and (3) lifestyle advice. Addition of an educational seminar led to significantly fewer men dropping out of AS: at 1 and 5yr the dropout rate was 25% and 42%, respectively, in the standard care group, compared to 11% and 22% (p=0.001) in the intervention group. In the intervention group, 18 men failed to attend the seminar.  Conclusions:   The AS dropout rate was halved following a single educational seminar delivered to groups of men with intermediate- or low-risk PC, even at 5yr.

Objective:   To explore the role of novel potential ICEs based on clinical follow-up to predict long-term survival in patients with high-risk prostate cancer.  Design, setting, and participants:   Overall, 3507 patients treated at 12 tertiary referral centers between 1988 and 2016 were evaluated.  Intervention:   Radical prostatectomy (RP) with extended pelvic lymph node dissection.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   The impact of biochemical recurrence (BCR) and clinical recurrence (CR) within 1, 3, 5, and 7yr after surgery on the risk of OS was evaluated in multivariable Cox regression analyses. In patients with BCR, the impact of progression to CR within 6mo and 1, 3, and 5yr on long-term OS was investigated. Discrimination was assessed using Harrell's c index.  Results and limitations:   Median follow-up for survivors was 76mo. The 5- and 10-yr OS and cancer-specific survival rates were 94% and 81% versus 98% and 95%, respectively. On a time-varying multivariable analysis, BCR (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.02; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.00, 1.04) and CR (HR: 1.05; 95% CI: 1.03-1.07) emerged as predictors of OS (p<0.001). The development of CR within 5yr after surgery was the most informative ICE for predicting OS (c index: 0.74). In patients with BCR, progression to CR within 12mo represented the most informative predictor for the subsequent risk of dying from all causes. Patients who developed BCR within 5yr after RP and progressed to CR within 12mo had a 10-yr OS rate of 47%. These results require prospective validation.  Conclusions:   When predicting long-term survival in surgically treated high-risk patients, progression to CR within 5yr of RP confers the highest discrimination with respect to other landmark points. In men experiencing BCR, progression to CR within the subsequent 12mo achieved the highest discrimination. Further studies are needed to validate our findings.

We and others have previously reported M2-TAM infiltration in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC).  Objective:   To determine whether the extent of M2-TAM infiltration correlates with PC aggressiveness.  Design, setting, and participants:   Normal prostate tissue, localized PC, and mCRPC samples from 192 patients were retrospectively analyzed.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   We analytically validated an immunohistochemistry assay for detection of the human mannose receptor (CD206) to assess M2 macrophage involvement.  Results and limitations:   Multiplex immunofluorescent staining showed that a small fraction of CD206 staining co-localized with the endothelial cells of lymphatic vessels, while the vast majority of staining occurred in CD68-positive macrophages. The area fraction of staining for CD206-positive macrophages increased in a stepwise fashion from normal (ie, no inflammation) prostate tissue, to primary untreated carcinomas, to hormone-naïve regional lymph node metastases, to mCRPC. Complementary studies using flow cytometry confirmed CD206-positive M2-TAM infiltration. Limitations include the small number of rapid autopsy samples and the lack of neuroendocrine PC samples.  Conclusions:   Our results revealed a progressive increase in CD206-positive macrophages from normal prostate to mCRPC. Given the immunosuppressive nature of macrophages and the lack of clinical success of immunotherapy for PC patients, our results provide a rationale for therapeutic targeting of macrophages in the PC microenvironment as a potential method to augment immunotherapeutic responses.

Interaction and cooperation of ERG and SP1 may be instrumental in sustaining the tumorigenic and metastatic phenotype and could represent a potential vulnerability in ERG fusion-positive tumors.  Objective:   To test the activity of EC-8042, a compound able to block SP1, in cellular and mouse models of ERG-positive prostate cancer.  Design, setting, and participants:   We evaluated the activity of EC-8042 in cell cultures and ERG/PTEN transgenic/knockout mice that provide reliable models for testing novel therapeutics in this specific disease context. Using a new protocol to generate tumor spheroids from ERG/PTEN mice, we also examined the effects of EC-8042 on tumor-propagating stem-like cancer cells with high self-renewal and tumorigenic capabilities.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   The efficacy of EC-8042 was determined by measuring the proliferative capacity and target gene expression in cell cultures, invasive and metastatic capabilities in chick chorioallantoic membrane assays, and tumor development in mice. Significance was determined using statistical test.  Results and limitations:   EC-8042 blocked transcription of ERG-regulated genes and reverted the invasive and metastatic phenotype of VCaP cells. EC-8042 blocked the expansion of stem-like tumor cells in tumor spheroids from VCaP cells and mouse-derived tumors. In ERG/PTEN mice, systemic treatment with EC-8042 inhibited ERG-regulated gene transcription, tumor progression, and tumor-propagating stem-like tumor cells.  Conclusions:   Our data support clinical testing of EC-8042 for the treatment of ERG-positive prostate cancer in precision medicine approaches.  Patient summary:   In this study, EC-8042, a novel compound with a favorable pharmacological and toxicological profile, exhibited relevant activity in cell cultures and in vivo in a genetically engineered mouse model that closely recapitulates the features of clinically aggressive ERG-positive prostate cancer.

Objective:   To compare clinically significant prostate cancer (csPCa) detection rate with magnetic resonance imaging-transrectal ultrasound (MRI-TRUS) fusion versus in-bore biopsy in men with abnormal multiparametric MRI (mpMRI).  Design, setting, and participants:   This single-center, retrospective analysis of prospectively generated data included all men with abnormal mpMRI and fusion or in-bore biopsy between May 2017 and April 2018. Grade group (GG) 2-5 cancers were considered csPCa.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Detection of csPCa was adjusted according to patient- and lesion-related characteristics using propensity score weighting. Secondary endpoints included the detection of clinically insignificant tumors and the rate of GG upgrade from biopsy to prostatectomy specimen. Analyses were performed at patient and lesion levels.  Results and limitations:   A total of 103 and 300 men were included in the in-bore and fusion cohorts, respectively. On a per-patient basis, in-bore biopsies detected a higher proportion of csPCa (61%, 63/103) than fusion plus systematic biopsies (47%, 141/300; adjusted odds ratio [OR]: 2.1, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.6-2.8, p<0.0001). In-bore biopsies also detected fewer (11%, 11/103) clinically insignificant cancers than fusion biopsies (18%, 53/300; OR: 0.5, 95% CI: 0.3-0.8, p=0.001).

A disulfide cyclic peptide ligand [CTVRTSADC] 1 has been previously found to target extra domain B of fibronectin (EDB-FN) in the extracellular matrix that can differentiate aggressive PCa from benign prostatic hyperplasia. We synthesized and optimized the stability of ligand 1 by amide cyclization to obtain [KTVRTSADE] 8 using Fmoc/tBu solid-phase chemistry. Optimized targeting ligand 8 was found to be stable in phosphate buffered saline (PBS, pH 6.5, 7.0, and 7.5) and under redox conditions, with a half-life longer than 8 h. Confocal microscopy studies demonstrated increased binding of ligand 8 to EDB-FN compared to ligand 1. Therefore, we hypothesized that the EDB-FN targeted peptides (1 and 8) conjugated with an anticancer drug via a hydrolyzable linker would provide selective cytotoxicity to the cancer cells. To test our hypothesis, we selected both the normal prostate cell line, RWPE-1, and the cancerous prostate cell lines, PC3, DU-145, LNCaP, and C4-2, to evaluate the anticancer activity of synthesized peptide-drug conjugates. Docetaxel (Doce) and doxorubicin (Dox) were used as anticancer drugs. Dox conjugate 13 containing disulfide linkage showed comparable cytotoxicity versus Dox after 72 h incubation in all the cancer cell lines, whereas it was found to be less cytotoxic on RWPE-1, suggesting that it can act as a Dox prodrug. Doce conjugate 14 was found to be less cytotoxic in all the cell lines as compared to drug alone.""","""['Shang Eun Park', 'Kiumars Shamloo', 'Timothy A Kristedja', 'Shaban Darwish', 'Marco Bisoffi', 'Keykavous Parang', 'Rakesh Kumar Tiwari']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Int J Mol Sci""","""['EDB Fibronectin Specific Peptide for Prostate Cancer Targeting.', 'Synthesis and Assessment of Peptide Gd-DOTA Conjugates Targeting Extradomain B Fibronectin for Magnetic Resonance Molecular Imaging of Prostate Cancer.', 'Synthesis and antiproliferative activities of doxorubicin thiol conjugates and doxorubicin-SS-cyclic peptide.', 'Targeted cancer therapy: conferring specificity to cytotoxic drugs.', 'Peptide-Drug Conjugates with Different Linkers for Cancer Therapy.', 'The Synthesis of Conjugated Peptides Containing Triazole and Quinolone-3-Carboxamide Moieties Designed as Anticancer Agents.', 'Noninvasive assessment and therapeutic monitoring of drug-resistant colorectal cancer by MR molecular imaging of extradomain-B fibronectin.', 'Peptides for Health Benefits 2019.']"""

Multiple disciplinary team (MDT) mechanism may propose an appropriate treatment plan for patients and can effectively improve patient prognosis and survival, reduce patient diagnosis and treatment waiting time, and greatly improve patient satisfaction.  Patient concerns:   Here, we presented a case of a 77-year-old man with a persistently elevated serum level of prostate-specific antigen (PSA), who had a history of radical prostatectomy (RP) and of 9 years endocrine therapy.  Diagnoses:   Castration-resistant prostate cancer and locally recurrent prostate cancer.  Interventions:   Androgen-deprivation therapy was first utilized 2 months after RP, due to the consideration of BCR on May 5, 2007. And during the next 9 years, he was treated with different endocrine agents but failed to maintain serum levels of PSA stable. Finally, the MDT suggested patient to perform salvage radiation therapy (SRT). Under MDT mechanism, we avoid secondary surgery, so as to reduce the patients' mental suffering and cost of patient care.  Outcomes:   EPIC26 scale assessment revealed leak-free urine, good urine control, no defecation abnormalities or blood in the stool, no breast tenderness and breast enlargement significantly improved. The patient now has no adjuvant therapy, including endocrine therapy. The patient achieved good prognosis through local RT.  Lessons:   Pelvic SRT for patients with locally recurrent PCa may restore the same radical effect as RP.

We sought to use a multiplex gene expression platform to interrogate CTCs and identify potential markers of resistance to abiraterone and enzalutamide. 37 patients with mCRPC initiating treatment with enzalutamide (n = 16) or abiraterone (n = 21) were prospectively enrolled for CTC collection and gene expression analysis using a panel of 89 prostate cancer-related genes. Gene expression from CTCs was correlated with PSA response and radioclinical progression-free survival (PFS) using Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analyses. Twenty patients (54%) had detectable CTCs. At a median follow-up of 11.3 months, increased expression of the following genes was significantly associated with shorter PSA PFS and radioclinical PFS: AR, AR-V7, PSA, PSCA, TSPAN8, NKX3.1, and WNT5B. Additionally, high SPINK1 expression was associated with increased PFS. A predictive model including all eight genes gave an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.84 for PSA PFS and 0.86 for radioclinical PFS. In comparison, the AR-V7 only model resulted in AUC values of 0.65 and 0.64.These data demonstrate that clinically relevant information regarding gene expression can be obtained from whole blood using a CTC-based approach.

This is particularly true in establishing expectations regarding PSA nadir (nPSA) and PSA bounces, which can be disconcerting. As increasingly more patients are being treated with stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) for low- and intermediate-risk PCa, it is imperative to understand the PSA response to SBRT.  Methods and materials:   PSA data from 5 institutions were retrospectively analyzed for patients with localized PCa treated definitively with SBRT alone from 2004 to 2016. Patients received 35 to 40 Gy in 5 fractions, per institutional standards. Patients who had less than 12 months of PSA data or received androgen deprivation therapy were excluded from this study. Linear and logistic multivariable analysis were performed to identify predictors of nPSA, bounce, and biochemical recurrence, and joint latent class models were developed to identify significant predictors of time to biochemical failure.  Results:   A total of 1062 patients were included in this study. Median follow-up was 66 months (interquartile range [IQR], 36.4-89.9 months). Biochemical failure per the Phoenix criteria occurred in 4% of patients. Median nPSA was 0.2 ng/mL, median time to nPSA was 40 months, 84% of patients had an nPSA ≤0.5 ng/mL, and 54% of patients had an nPSA ≤0.2 ng/mL. On multivariable analysis, nPSA was a significant predictor of biochemical failure. Benign PSA bounce was noted in 26% of patients. The median magnitude of PSA bounce was 0.52 ng/mL (IQR, 0.3-1.0 ng/mL). Median time to PSA bounce was 18.1 months (IQR, 12.0-31.1 months). On multivariable analysis, age and radiation dose were significantly associated with a lower incidence of bounce. Joint latent class models modeling found that nPSA and radiation dose were significantly associated with longer time to biochemical failure.  Conclusions:   In this multi-institutional cohort of patients with long-term follow-up, we found that SBRT led to low nPSAs. In turn, lower nPSAs are associated with reduced incidence of, and longer time to, biochemical failure. Benign PSA bounces occurred in a quarter of patients, as late as several years after treatment. Further studies are needed to directly compare the PSA response of patients who receive SBRT versus other treatment modalities.""","""['Naomi Y Jiang', 'Audrey T Dang', 'Ye Yuan', 'Fang-I Chu', 'David Shabsovich', 'Christopher R King', 'Sean P Collins', 'Nima Aghdam', 'Simeng Suy', 'Constantine A Mantz', 'Leszek Miszczyk', 'Aleksandra Napieralska', 'Agnieszka Namysl-Kaletka', 'Hilary Bagshaw', 'Nicolas Prionas', 'Mark K Buyyounouski', 'William C Jackson', 'Daniel E Spratt', 'Nicholas G Nickols', 'Michael L Steinberg', 'Patrick A Kupelian', 'Amar U Kishan']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys""","""['Prostate-specific antigen kinetics and biochemical control following stereotactic body radiation therapy, high dose rate brachytherapy, and low dose rate brachytherapy: A multi-institutional analysis of 3502 patients.', 'Early and multiple PSA bounces can occur following high-dose prostate stereotactic body radiation therapy: Subset analysis of a phase 1/2 trial.', 'Refining the definition of biochemical failure in the era of stereotactic body radiation therapy for prostate cancer: The Phoenix definition and beyond.', 'Stereotactic radiotherapy for prostate cancer: A review and future directions.', 'Polysaccharide-based nanocomposites for biomedical applications: a critical review.', 'Robotic stereotactic body radiotherapy for localized prostate cancer: final analysis of the German HYPOSTAT trial.', 'Early Prostate-Specific Antigen Kinetics for Low- and Intermediate-Risk Prostate Cancer Treated With Definitive Radiation Therapy.', 'Management of Isolated Local Failures Following Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy for Low to Intermediate Risk Prostate Cancer.', 'Prostate-specific antigen dynamics after neoadjuvant androgen-deprivation therapy and carbon ion radiotherapy for prostate cancer.', 'Dose-response with stereotactic body radiotherapy for prostate cancer: A multi-institutional analysis of prostate-specific antigen kinetics and biochemical control.']"""

Methods:   Sixty-seven prostate cancer tissue specimens and 20 benign prostatic hyperplasia specimens were used to investigate the correlation between SARI expression and clinicopathologic parameters. Immunohistochemistry was used to detect the SARI and E-cadherin protein expression in the prostate cancer and benign prostatic hyperplasia specimens, and their correlation was established. Quantitative PCR (qPCR) was used to determine the SARI mRNA expression in a normal prostate cell line (RWPE-1) and prostate cancer cell lines (LNCaP and PC3). Western blotting was used to detect the SARI protein expression in the RWPE-1, LNCaP, and PC3 cell lines.  Results:   SARI protein expression did not correlate with the prostate cancer patients' age or serum Prostate-Specific Antigen value but did show a correlation with the tumor stage of prostate cancer and Gleason score. SARI and E-cadherin expression in the prostate cancer tissue was significantly lower than in the benign prostatic hyperplasia specimens, suggesting a positive correlation between the SARI and E-cadherin expression. SARI mRNA and protein were highly expressed in RWPE-1, the normal prostate cell line, but SARI mRNA and protein expression were reduced in the prostate cancer cell lines, LNCaP and PC3.

The enzyme exerts multiple cytoprotective functions associated with the promotion of angiogenesis and counteraction of the detrimental effects of cellular stress which are crucial for the survival of both normal and tumor cells. Accordingly, in many tumor types, high expression of HO-1 correlates with poor prognosis and resistance to treatment, i.e. chemotherapy, suggesting inhibition of HO-1 as a possible antitumor approach. At the same time, the lack of selective and well-profiled inhibitors of HO-1 determines the unmet need for new modulators of this enzyme, with the potential to be used in either adjuvant therapy or as the stand-alone targeted therapeutics. In the current study, we provided novel inhibitors of HO-1 and validated the effect of pharmacological inhibition of HO activity by the imidazole-based inhibitor (SLV-11199) in human pancreatic (PANC-1) and prostate (DU-145) cancer cell lines. We demonstrated potent inhibition of HO activity in vitro and showed associated anticancer effectiveness of SLV-11199. Treatment with the tested compound led to decreased cancer cell viability and clonogenic potential. It has also sensitized the cancer cells to chemotherapy. In PANC-1 cells, diminished HO activity resulted in down-regulation of pro-angiogenic factors like IL-8. Mechanistic investigations revealed that the treatment with SLV-11199 decreased cell migration and inhibited MMP-1 and MMP-9 expression. Moreover, it affected mesenchymal phenotype by regulating key modulators of the epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) signalling axis. Finally, F-actin cytoskeleton and focal contacts were destabilized by the reported compound. Overall, the current study suggests a possible relevance of the tested novel inhibitor of HO activity as a potential anticancer compound.

In our study, we identified G Protein-Coupled Receptor Class C Group 5 Member A (GPRC5A) as a candidate therapeutic molecule using integrative gene expression analyses of registered data sets for prostate cancer cell lines. Kaplan-Meier analysis of TCGA data sets revealed that patients who have high GPRC5A expression had significantly shorter overall survival. PC3 prostate cancer cells with CRISPR/Cas9-mediated GPRC5A knockout exhibited significantly reduced cell proliferation both in vitro and in vivo. RNA-seq revealed that GPRC5A KO PC3 cells had dysregulated expression of cell cycle-related genes, leading to cell cycle arrest at the G2/M phase. Furthermore, the registered gene expression profile data set showed that the expression level of GPRC5A in original lesions of prostate cancer patients with bone metastasis was higher than that without bone metastasis. In fact, GPRC5A KO PC3 cells failed to establish bone metastasis in xenograft mice models. In addition, our clinical study revealed that GPRC5A expression levels in prostate cancer patient samples were significantly correlated with bone metastasis as well as the patient's Gleason score (GS). Combined assessment with the immunoreactivity of GPRC5A and GS displayed higher specificity for predicting the occurrence of bone metastasis.

Our objective was to quantify the prevalence and variation of low-value PSA screening across the Veterans Health Administration (VA), which has instituted programs to reduce low-value care.  Design:   Retrospective cohort.  Setting:   VA administrative data, 2014 to 2015.  Participants:   National random sample (N = 214 480) of male veterans, aged 75 years or older.  Measurements:   We defined PSA screening in men aged 75 years or older without a history of prostate cancer as low value, per established definitions in Medicare. We calculated screening rates overall and by VA Medical Center (VAMC), adjusting for patient and VAMC-level factors. We characterized variation across VAMCs using the adjusted median odds ratio (OR) and compared the adjusted OR of screening between VAMCs in different deciles of low-value screening rates. In separate sensitivity analyses, we assessed screening in veterans at greatest risk of 1-year mortality and among veterans after excluding those who underwent prostatectomy, had a prior PSA elevation, or had a clinical indication for testing.  Results:   Overall, 37 867 (17.7%) of veterans underwent low-value PSA screening (VAMC range = 3.3%-38.2%). The adjusted median OR was 1.88, meaning the median odds of screening would increase by 88% were a veteran to transfer his care to a VAMC with higher screening rates. Veterans at VAMCs in the top decile had an adjusted OR of 12.9 (95% confidence interval = 11.0-15.2) compared to those veterans in the lowest decile. Among veterans with the greatest mortality risk (n = 23 377), 3496 (15.0%) underwent screening (VAMC range = 1.7%-46.3%). After excluding veterans with a prior prostatectomy, PSA elevation, or a potential clinical indication, 31 556 (14.7%) underwent screening (VAMC range = 2.0%-49.9%).  Conclusions:   In a national cohort of older veterans, more than one in six received low-value PSA screening, with greater than 10-fold variation across VAMCs and high rates of screening among those with the greatest mortality risk.

Additional in vivo measurements showed a maximum temperature increase at the SAR hotspot of 0.7°C over 6 min on 31 P at 1.9 W transmit (Tx) power, indicating safe maximum power levels. When transmitting with the external 1 H body array at 40W for 2:30 min, the temperature increase around the ERC was < 0.3°C. Up to 3.5 cm into the prostate the 1 H microstrip of the ERC provided higher SNR than the 8CH. The total coil combination allowed acquisition of an mpMRI protocol and the assessment of 31 P and 1 H metabolites of the prostate in all test subjects.  Conclusion:   We developed a setup with a 31 P transceiver and 1 H Rx endorectal coil in combination with an 8-channel transceiver external body array coil and demonstrated its safety and feasibility for obtaining multiparametric imaging and 1 H and 31 P MRSI at 7T in patients with prostate cancer within one MR examination.""","""['Bart W J Philips', 'Mark J van Uden', 'Stefan H G Rietsch', 'Stephan Orzada', 'Tom W J Scheenen']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Development and evaluation of a multichannel endorectal RF coil for prostate MRI at 7T in combination with an external surface array.', 'Clinical comparison between a currently available single-loop and an investigational dual-channel endorectal receive coil for prostate magnetic resonance imaging: a feasibility study at 1.5 and 3 T.', 'An 8-channel transceiver 7-channel receive RF coil setup for high SNR ultrahigh-field MRI of the shoulder at 7T.', 'A systematic review on multiparametric MR imaging in prostate cancer detection.', 'Doctor, a patient is on the phone asking about the endorectal coil!', 'New insights into lipid metabolism and prostate cancer (Review).', 'Radiofrequency antenna concepts for human cardiac MR at 14.0\xa0T.', 'Multinuclear MRI in Drug Discovery.', 'Ultra-high-field MR in Prostate cancer: Feasibility and Potential.', 'Developments in proton MR spectroscopic imaging of prostate cancer.']"""

The association of post-treatment prostate-specific antigen (PSA) decline with clinical outcomes may provide important prognostic information.  Objective:   To evaluate associations between the magnitude of PSA decline from baseline to month 3 and clinical outcomes among enzalutamide recipients.  Design, setting, and participants:   This was a post hoc retrospective analysis of PREVAIL, an international, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 study. Men with mCRPC and no prior chemotherapy from the enzalutamide arm were included (n=872). Patients were grouped by confirmed maximal PSA decline from baseline to month 3 of treatment (n=795 evaluable).  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Primary outcomes were overall survival and radiographic progression-free survival. Secondary outcomes included PSA progression-free survival, radiographic response, and degradation of Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Prostate score, which were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method.  Results and limitations:   Following 3mo of enzalutamide treatment, 88% (701/795), 80% (639/795), and 39% (307/795) of patients had postbaseline confirmed maximal PSA declines of ≥30%, ≥50%, and ≥90%, respectively, whereas 12% (94/795) had no confirmed maximal PSA decline or a decline of <30%. Greater degrees of PSA decline within the first 3mo of enzalutamide treatment were increasingly associated with longer overall survival, time to PSA and radiographic progression, higher objective soft-tissue responses, and longer time to quality-of-life deterioration than no PSA decline or declines of <30% from baseline. PSA flares (rise followed by fall) after enzalutamide treatment were rare (<1%).  Conclusions:   The magnitude of PSA decline after 3mo of enzalutamide therapy was strongly associated with better clinical and patient-reported outcomes. This updated prognostic information is of clinical value to this patient population and their health care providers.  Patient summary:   We report that decreases in PSA levels are closely linked to better health and survival after 3mo of enzalutamide treatment in men with metastatic prostate cancer.

In this study, the cytotoxic potential of GGE was assessed in PC-3 cells, when it is administrated alone or in combination with Adriamycin. PC-3 cells were treated with GGE and/or ADR, and the inhibition of cell proliferation was evaluated by the MTT assay. Cell cycle alterations and apoptosis rate were measured through flow cytometry. Expression levels of autophagy-related genes were evaluated with specific ELISA kits, Western blotting, and real-time PCR, while NMR spectrometry was used to identify the implication of specific metabolites.

Yet, the cost-effectiveness of these treatment options has not been fully compared under Hong Kong's setting. This cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) serves as the first study in Hong Kong to compare the economic value of these two combinations ADT + AA vs. ADT + D.  Methods:   A deterministic Markov model is used to project cost-effectiveness of each treatment until death. Survival curves for progression/death were extracted and digitized from the five RCTs (CHAARTED, LATITUDE, two STAMPEDE (2016/2017), and GETUG-AFU15). Clinically significant adverse events (AEs) were modeled; utility values were obtained from the literature. Primary outcomes were the quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). We used the societal perspective from Hong Kong and considered three times of local gross domestic product per capita (GDPpc) as the willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold (i.e., US$138,649). We estimated the break-even cost of AA in case ADT + AA is not a cost-effective strategy under this WTP threshold. While considering the standard AA dosage (1000 mg) as the main analysis, we also examined the potential impact of the low-dose AA (250 mg) strategy.  Results:   Integrating simulations with probabilistic sensitivity analysis, ADT + D returns 0.79 (median; 95% credible interval 0.56-0.97) QALY with an ICER of US$14,397/QALY ($7824-22,632) compared to ADT-alone. A head-to-head comparison indicates that ADT + AA further gains 0.79 (0.45-1.17) QALY but with an ICER of $361,439/QALY ($260,615-599,683) when compared to ADT + D. Considering three times of GDPpc as WTP threshold, ADT + D is more cost-effective in all simulations; while ADT + AA is more cost-effective than ADT + D only if the cost of AA is reduced by at least 63%. The low-dose AA (250 mg) strategy is potentially cost-effective when it generates equivalent efficacy as the standard dosage (1000 mg).  Conclusions:   ADT + D is therefore shown to be a more cost-effective strategy than ADT + AA in metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer patients in developed economies. Addition of AA substantially improved QALY compared to D but at a significant cost.""","""['Chi Leung Chiang#', 'Tsz Him So#', 'Tai Chung Lam', 'Horace C W Choi']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Prostate Cancer Prostatic Dis""","""['Cost-Effectiveness of Systemic Treatments for Metastatic Castration-Sensitive Prostate Cancer: An Economic Evaluation Based on Network Meta-Analysis.', 'Cost-effectiveness of abiraterone versus docetaxel in the treatment of metastatic hormone naïve prostate cancer.', 'Clinical Outcomes of First-line Abiraterone Acetate or Enzalutamide for Metastatic Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer After Androgen Deprivation Therapy\xa0+ Docetaxel or ADT Alone for Metastatic Hormone-sensitive Prostate Cancer.', 'Abiraterone Acetate for the Treatment of Chemotherapy-Naïve Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer: An Evidence Review Group Perspective of an NICE Single Technology Appraisal.', 'Abiraterone acetate/androgen deprivation therapy combination versus docetaxel/androgen deprivation therapy combination in advanced hormone-sensitive prostate cancer: a network meta-analysis on safety and efficacy.', 'Survival modelling and cost-effectiveness analysis of treatments for newly diagnosed metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer.', 'A cost-utility analysis of apalutamide for metastatic castrationsensitive prostate cancer.', 'Systemic therapies for metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer: network meta-analysis.', 'Cost-Effectiveness of Anti-Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Therapy Versus Bevacizumab in KRAS Wild-Type (WT), Pan-RAS WT, and Pan-RAS WT Left-Sided Metastatic Colorectal Cancer.', 'Cost-effectiveness of Pembrolizumab as a Second-Line Therapy for Hepatocellular Carcinoma.']"""

To identify HOXB13 transcriptional targets in metastatic PCs, we performed integrative bioinformatics analysis of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the proximity of the human prostate tumor-specific AR binding sites. Unsupervised Principal Component Analysis (PCA) led to a focused core HOXB13 target gene-set referred to as HOTPAM9 (HOXB13 Targets separating Primary And Metastatic PCs). HOTPAM9 comprised 7 mitotic kinase genes overexpressed in metastatic PCs, TRPM8, and the heat shock protein HSPB8, whose levels were significantly lower in metastatic PCs compared to the primary disease. The expression of a two-gene set, CIT and HSPB8 with an overall balanced accuracy of 98.8% and a threshold value of 0.2347, was sufficient to classify metastasis. HSPB8 mRNA expression was significantly increased following HOXB13 depletion in multiple metastatic CRPC models.

Transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) is known to induce epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and abundance of TGF-β in the bone matrix is one of the important growth factors contributing to bone metastasis. TGF-β is reported as a key mediator of bone metastasis, but the underlying mechanism has not been elucidated. It was found in our study that Interferon-inducible Transmembrane Protein 3 (IFITM3) played a key role in the regulation of malignant tumor cell proliferation, invasion, and bone migration by binding to Smad4, thus activating the TGF-β-Smads Signaling Pathway. Lentivirus-mediated short hairpin RNA (shRNA) knockdown of IFITM3 inhibited cell proliferation and colony formation, induced apoptosis and inhibited migration by reversing EMT and downregulating the expression of metastasis-related molecules including FGFs and PTHrP. Microarray analysis showed that IFITM3 knockdown could alter the MAPK pathway associated with TGF-β-Smads signaling. By knocking down and overexpressing IFITM3, we demonstrated that IFITM3 expression level had an effect on MAPK pathway activation, and this change was more pronounced upon exogenous TGF-β stimulation.

However, the detailed biological functions, underlying mechanisms and clinical relevance of PCAT1 in ESCC remain unclear. Here, we confirmed that PCAT1 was highly expressed in ESCC tissues and cell lines. Knockdown of PCAT1 inhibited the growth of ESCC cells, whereas overexpression of PCAT1 showed the opposite effect both in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, knockdown of PCAT1 arrested the cell cycle at G2/M phase, reduced the expression of cyclin B1 and CDC2, and caused cells to be more sensitive to paclitaxel. Furthermore, PCAT1 could bind to miR-326, a tumour suppressor in diverse human cancers. Rescue experiments revealed that enforced expression of miR-326 attenuated the promotive effect of PCAT1 on ESCC cell growth. In addition, we discovered that PCAT1 was present in ESCC cell-derived exosomes, was higher in the serum of ESCC patients than those of healthy volunteer donors, and promoted cell growth through exosomes.

In the health sciences literature, the Decisional Conflict Scale is widely used to measure decisional conflict, yet limited research has described the psychometric properties of the Decisional Conflict Scale subscales and of the low literacy version of the scale. The purpose of this secondary data analysis was therefore to examine properties of the original (DCS-12) and low literacy (LL DCS-10) Decisional Conflict Scales using Classical Measurement Theory and Item Response Theory.  Methods:   Data from two multi-site trials of men with prostate cancer were used to analyze the DCS-12, LL DCS-10, and an aggregated DCS-12 dataset in which five response options were aggregated into three. Internal consistency was estimated with Cronbach's alphas. Subscale correlations were evaluated with Pearson's correlation coefficient. Item difficulty, item discrimination, and test information were evaluated using Graded Response Modeling (GRM). The likelihood ratio test guided model selection.  Results:   Cronbach's alphas for the total scales and three of four subscales were ≥ 0.85. Alphas ranged from 0.34-0.57 for the support subscales. Subscale correlations ranged from 0.42-0.71 (P < 0.001). Items on the DCS-12 exhibited the widest range of difficulty. Two items on the support subscale had low to moderate discrimination and contributed little information. Only the DCS-12 was informative across the full range of decisional conflict values.  Conclusions:   Lack of precision in the support subscale raises concerns about subscale validity. The DCS-12 is most capable of discriminating between respondents with high and low decisional conflict.

This study, conducted in the Illawarra Shoalhaven Local Health District (ISLHD), Australia, quantifies how much we can spare carbapenem use.  Methods:   A retrospective audit of patients who underwent TRUS prostate biopsy and were admitted post-operatively with proven bacteraemia between January 2007 and April 2016.  Results:   Of 2719 TRUS procedures, 50 (1.84%) cases had bacteraemia. The most common isolate was Escherichia coli in 44 of 50 (88%) of which six of 50 (12%) were extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing. Sixteen different empirical antimicrobial regimens were used, to which 42 of 50 (84%) of isolates were susceptible. Eight (16%) isolates were resistant to the chosen empiric combination, with five switched over to appropriate treatment once antimicrobial sensitivity results became available. Empirical carbapenem was utilized in 12 of 50 (24%) patients with only two of the ESBL isolates covered. A further 10 of 50 patients received carbapenems during their admission. Carbapenems could have been avoided in 18 of 22 (82%). A total of 86% of organisms (n = 43) were susceptible to the combination of amoxicillin-clavulanate and gentamicin.

We sought to determine whether subclassification of high-risk prostate cancer based on clinical factors correlates with genomic markers of risk.  Methods and materials:   We identified 3220 patients with NCCN unfavorable intermediate-risk (n = 2000) or high-risk (n = 1220) prostate cancer from a prospective multi-institutional registry cohort. We defined the following subclassification of high-risk prostate cancer based on previously published data: favorable high risk (cT1c, Gleason 6, and PSA >20 ng/mL or cT1c, Gleason 4 + 4 = 8, PSA <10 ng/mL); very high risk (cT3b-T4 or primary Gleason pattern 5); and standard high risk (all others with cT3a, Gleason score ≥8, or PSA >20 ng/mL). We used a set of 33 previously developed genomic classifiers, including Decipher, to determine whether high-risk genomic features correlate with clinical subclasses of high-risk prostate cancer.  Results:   Among those with favorable high-risk, standard high-risk, and very high-risk prostate cancer, 50.4%, 64.2%, and 81.6% had a high-risk Decipher score, respectively (P < .001). Among 32 other genomic signatures, 29 had a similar trend of increasing risk scores across the 3 subclasses of high-risk disease (P < .05 after correction for multiple hypothesis testing). Patients in the 3 subclasses of high-risk disease had a median of 4, 6, and 13 high-risk signatures, respectively. In comparison, among those with unfavorable intermediate-risk prostate cancer, 38.2% had a high-risk Decipher score, and the median number of high-risk signatures was 3.  Conclusions:   Although NCCN guidelines currently use a 2-tiered system for high-risk prostate cancer, genomic markers of risk correlate with the clinically validated subclassification of high-risk prostate cancer into favorable high-risk, standard high-risk, and very high-risk disease, further confirming the prognostic utility of this 3-tiered stratification.""","""['Vinayak Muralidhar', 'Jingbin Zhang', 'Qiqi Wang', 'Brandon A Mahal', 'Santino S Butler', 'Daniel E Spratt', 'Elai Davicioni', 'Oliver Sartor', 'Felix Y Feng', 'Kent W Mouw', 'Paul L Nguyen']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys""","""['Unification of favourable intermediate-, unfavourable intermediate-, and very high-risk stratification criteria for prostate cancer.', 'Validation of a subclassification for high-risk prostate cancer in a prospective cohort.', 'A genomic classifier improves prediction of metastatic disease within 5 years after surgery in node-negative high-risk prostate cancer patients managed by radical prostatectomy without adjuvant therapy.', 'Hidden clues in prostate cancer - Lessons learned from clinical and pre-clinical approaches on diagnosis and risk stratification.', 'Does true Gleason pattern 3 merit its cancer descriptor?', 'Population-Based Comparison of Different Risk Stratification Systems Among Prostate Cancer Patients.']"""

The prostanoid thromboxane (TX)A2 is a pro-inflammatory mediator implicated in several prostatic diseases, including PCa. TXA2 signals through the TPα and TPβ isoforms of the T Prostanoid receptor (TP) which exhibit several functional differences and transcriptionally regulated by distinct promoters Prm1 and Prm3, respectively, within the TBXA2R gene. This study examined the expression of TPα and TPβ in inflammatory infiltrates within human prostate tissue. Strikingly, TPβ expression was detected in 94% of infiltrates, including in B- and T-lymphocytes and macrophages. In contrast, TPα was more variably expressed and, where present, expression was mainly confined to macrophages. To gain molecular insight into these findings, expression of TPα and TPβ was evaluated as a function of monocyte-to-macrophage differentiation in THP-1 cells. Expression of both TPα and TPβ was upregulated following phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA)-induced differentiation of monocytic THP-1 to their macrophage lineage. Furthermore, FOXP1, an essential transcriptional regulator down-regulated during monocyte-to-macrophage differentiation, was identified as a key trans-acting factor regulating TPβ expression through Prm3 in THP-1 cells. Knockdown of FOXP1 increased TPβ, but not TPα, expression in THP-1 cells, while genetic reporter and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analyses established that FOXP1 exerts its repressive effect on TPβ through binding to four cis-elements within Prm3. Collectively, FOXP1 functions as a transcriptional repressor of TPβ in monocytes. This repression is lifted in differentiated macrophages, allowing for upregulation of TPβ expression and possibly accounting for the prominent expression of TPβ in prostate tissue-resident macrophages.""","""['Eamon P Mulvaney', ""Áine G O'Sullivan"", 'Sarah B Eivers', 'Helen M Reid', 'B Therese Kinsella']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Exp Mol Pathol""","""['Regulated expression of the TPβ isoform of the human T prostanoid receptor by the tumour suppressors FOXP1 and NKX3.1: Implications for the role of thromboxane in prostate cancer.', 'Expression of the TPα and TPβ isoforms of the thromboxane prostanoid receptor (TP) in prostate cancer: clinical significance and diagnostic potential.', ""Transcriptional regulation of the human thromboxane A2 receptor gene by Wilms' tumor (WT)1 and hypermethylated in cancer (HIC) 1 in prostate and breast cancers."", 'Transcriptional Regulation of the Human Thromboxane A2 Receptor Gene by Wilms’ Tumour (WT)1.', 'Regulation of the MIR155 host gene in physiological and pathological processes.', 'G9a promotes inflammation in Streptococcus pneumoniae induced pneumonia mice by stimulating M1 macrophage polarization and H3K9me2 methylation in FOXP1 promoter region.', 'Prostaglandin Pathways: Opportunities for Cancer Prevention and Therapy.']"""

Aim of our study was to comprehensively characterize the protein expression of CDK19 and its paralog CDK8 in PCa. We performed immunohistochemistry (IHC) for CDK19/CDK8 on a large cohort including needle biopsies from 202 patients, 799 primary tumor foci of radical prostatectomy specimens from 415 patients, 120 locally advanced tumor foci obtained by palliative transurethral resection, 140 lymph node metastases, 67 distant metastases and 82 benigns.

Nuclear CDK19 and CDK8 expression increases during progression showing the highest intensity in metastatic and castration-resistant tumors. High CDK19 expression on primary tumors correlates with DFS independently from Gleason grade and PSA.

Strategies based on nanosized metallodrugs combine the structural diversity and non-classical modes of action of metal complexes with the selectivity arising from the unique interaction of nanoparticles with biological membranes. A new family of water-soluble copper(ii) carbosilane metallodendrimers was synthesized and characterized as a nanotechnological alternative to current therapies. The interactions occurring over time between the dendrimers, at different generations (G0 to G2) and with different Cu(ii) counter-ions (nitrate vs. chloride), and cell-membrane models (cethyl-trimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) micelles and lecithin liposomes) were investigated using a computer-aided analysis of the electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra. The EPR analysis provided structural and dynamical information on the systems indicating that the increase in generation and the change of the Cu(ii) contra-ion - from nitrate to chloride - produce an increased relative amount and strength of interaction of the dendrimer with the model membranes. Interestingly, the stabilization effect produced a lower toxicity towards cancer cells. The cytotoxic effect of Cu(ii) metallodendrimers was verified by an in vitro screening in a selection of tumor cell lines, revealing the impact of multivalency on the effectivity and selectivity of the metallodrugs. As a proof-of-concept, first-generation dendrimer G1-Cu(ONO2)2 was selected for in-depth in vitro and in vivo antitumor evaluation towards resistant prostate cancer.

Moreover, initiating, let alone maintaining exercise programs with cancer survivors continues to have limited success. The aim of this trial is to evaluate the influence of peer support on moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA) and various markers of health 12 months following a brief supervised exercise intervention in cancer survivors.  Methods:   Men and women previously diagnosed with histologically-confirmed breast, colorectal or prostate cancer (n = 226), who are >1-month post-treatment, will be invited to participate in this trial. Once enrolled, participants will complete 4 weeks (12 sessions) of supervised high intensity interval training (HIIT). On completion of the supervised phase, both groups will be provided with written recommendations and verbally encouraged to achieve three HIIT sessions per week, or equivalent exercise that meets the exercise oncology guidelines. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive 12 months of peer support, or no peer support (control). Primary and secondary outcomes will be assessed at baseline, after the 4-week supervised HIIT phase and at 3-, 6- and 12-months. Primary outcomes will include accelerometry-derived MVPA and prescribed HIIT session adherence; whilst secondary outcomes will include cardiorespiratory fitness ([Formula: see text]), body composition, quality of life and select cytokines, myokines and inflammatory markers. Random effects mixed modelling will be used to compare mean changes in outcomes between groups at each time point. A group x time interaction will be used to formally test for differences between groups (alpha =0.05); utilising intention-to-treat analyses.  Discussion:   If successful, peer support may be proposed, adopted and implemented as a strategy to encourage cancer survivors to maintain exercise beyond the duration of a short-term, supervised intervention. A peer support-exercise model has the long-term potential to reduce comorbidities, improve physical and mental wellbeing, and significantly reduce the burden of disease in cancer survivors.

The probasin (Pb)-PRL transgenic mouse models this mechanism by overexpressing PRL specifically in the prostate epithelium leading to strong STAT5 activation in luminal cells. These mice exhibit hypertrophic prostates harboring various pre-neoplastic lesions that aggravate with age and accumulation of castration-resistant stem/progenitor cells. As STAT5 signaling is largely predominant over other classical PRL-triggered pathways in Pb-PRL prostates, we reasoned that Pb-Cre recombinase-driven genetic deletion of a floxed Stat5a/b locus should prevent prostate tumorigenesis in so-called Pb-PRLSTAT5 mice. Anterior and dorsal prostate lobes displayed the highest Stat5a/b deletion efficiency with no overt compensatory activation of other PRLR signaling cascade at 6 months of age; hence the development of tumor hallmarks was markedly reduced. Stat5a/b deletion also reversed the accumulation of stem/progenitor cells, indicating that STAT5 signaling regulates prostate epithelial cell hierarchy. Interestingly, ERK1/2 and AKT, but not STAT3 and androgen signaling, emerged as escape mechanisms leading to delayed tumor development in aged Pb-PRLSTAT5 mice. Unexpectedly, we found that Pb-PRL prostates spontaneously exhibited age-dependent decline of STAT5 signaling, also to the benefit of AKT and ERK1/2 signaling. As a consequence, both Pb-PRL and Pb-PRLSTAT5 mice ultimately displayed similar pathological prostate phenotypes at 18 months of age.

HepaRG originates from a liver tumor obtained from a patient with hepatocarcinoma and hepatitis C while SJCRH30 originates from a rhabdomyosarcoma patient tumor. In comparison to the revised Cambridge Reference Sequence, HepaRG and SJCRH30 mtDNA each contain 14 nucleotide variations. In addition to an insertion of a cytosine at position 315 (315insC), the mtDNA sequences from both cell types share six common polymorphisms. Heteroplasmic variants were identified in both cell types and included the identification of the 315insC mtDNA variant at 42 and 75% heteroplasmy in HepaRG and SJCRH30, respectively. Additionally, a novel heteroplasmic G13633A substitution in the HepaRG ND5 gene was detected at 33%. Previously reported cancer-associated mtDNA variants T195C and T16519C were identified in SJCRH30, both at homoplasmy (100%), while HepaRG mtDNA harbors a known prostate cancer-associated T6253C substitution at near homoplasmy, 95%. Based on our sequencing analysis, HepaRG mtDNA is predicted to lie within haplogroup branch H15a1 while SJCRH30 mtDNA is predicted to localize to H27c. The catalog of polymorphisms and heteroplasmy reported here should prove useful for future investigations of mtDNA maintenance in HepaRG and SJCRH30 cell lines.""","""['Matthew J Young', 'Anitha D Jayaprakash', 'Carolyn K J Young']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Int J Mol Sci""","""['Whole mitochondrial DNA variations in hippocampal surgical specimens and blood samples with high-throughput sequencing: a case of mesial temporal lobe epilepsy with hippocampal sclerosis.', 'Detection of mitochondrial DNA variants at low level heteroplasmy in pediatric CNS and extra-CNS solid tumors with three different enrichment methods.', 'Evaluating heteroplasmic variations of the mitochondrial genome from whole genome sequencing data.', 'Recent Advances in Detecting Mitochondrial DNA Heteroplasmic Variations.', 'Mitochondrial DNA heteroplasmy in the emerging field of massively parallel sequencing.', 'Identification of Somatic Mitochondrial DNA Mutations, Heteroplasmy, and Increased Levels of Catenanes in Tumor Specimens Obtained from Three Endometrial Cancer Patients.', ""The antiretroviral 2',3'-dideoxycytidine causes mitochondrial dysfunction in proliferating and differentiated HepaRG human cell cultures."", 'mtDNA and Mitochondrial Stress Signaling in Human Diseases: A Special Issue.']"""

Doxorubicin (DXR) is a widely used chemotherapeutical yet with severe side effects. The goal of the present study was to assess the pharmacologic effect of SEE and its bioactive components silibinin and silychristine when administrated alone or in combination with DXR in the human prostate cancer cells (PC-3). PC-3 cells were treated with SEE, silibinin (silybins A and B), silychristine, alone, and in combination with DXR, and cell proliferation was assessed by the MTT assay. Cell cycle, apoptosis, and autophagy rate were assessed by flow cytometry. Expression levels of autophagy-related genes were quantified by qRT-PCR, ELISA and western blot while transmission electron microscopy was performed to reveal autophagic structures. Finally, NMR spectrometry was used to identify specific metabolites related to autophagy. SEE inhibited PC-3 cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner while the co-treatment (DXR-SEE) revealed an additive cytotoxic effect. Cell cycle, apoptosis, and autophagy variations were observed in addition to altered expression levels of autophagy related genes (LC3, p62, NBR1, Beclin1, ULK1, AMBRA1), while several modifications in autophagic structures were identified after DXR-SEE co-treatment. Furthermore, treated cells showed a different metabolic profile, with significant alterations in autophagy-related metabolites such as branched-chain amino acids. In conclusion, the DXR-SEE co-treatment provokes perturbations in the autophagic mechanism of prostate cancer cells (PC-3) compared to DXR treatment alone, causing an excessive cell death. These findings propose the putative use of SEE as an adjuvant cytotoxic agent.""","""['Katerina Gioti', 'Anastasia Papachristodoulou', 'Dimitra Benaki', 'Sophia Havaki', 'Apostolos Beloukas', 'Argyro Vontzalidou', 'Nektarios Aligiannis', 'Alexios-Leandros Skaltsounis', 'Emmanuel Mikros', 'Roxane Tenta']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Planta Med""","""['Silibinin strongly synergizes human prostate carcinoma DU145 cells to doxorubicin-induced growth Inhibition, G2-M arrest, and apoptosis.', 'Milk thistle and prostate cancer: differential effects of pure flavonolignans from Silybum marianum on antiproliferative end points in human prostate carcinoma cells.', 'Glycyrrhiza glabra-Enhanced Extract and Adriamycin Antiproliferative Effect on PC-3 Prostate Cancer Cells.', 'New therapeutic potentials of milk thistle (Silybum marianum).', 'Safety and toxicity of silymarin, the major constituent of milk thistle extract: An updated review.', 'Assessment of the Nutraceutical Effects of Oleuropein and the Cytotoxic Effects of Adriamycin, When Administered Alone and in Combination, in MG-63 Human Osteosarcoma Cells.', 'The Impact of Icariside II on Human Prostate Cancer Cell Proliferation, Mobility, and Autophagy via PI3K-AKT-mTOR Signaling Pathway.', 'Silymarin and Cancer: A Dual Strategy in Both in Chemoprevention and Chemosensitivity.', 'Silibinin Augments the Antifibrotic Effect of Valsartan Through Inactivation of TGF-β1 Signaling in Kidney.']"""

Patients and methods:   A total of 56 consecutive patients with International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) grade 2-3 PCa after radical prostatectomy, who underwent both mpMRI and PSMA-PET CT (hereafter PSMA-PET) preoperatively, were enrolled in this study. The accuracy of PSMA-PET, mpMRI alone, and the two procedures in combination was analysed for identifying ISUP grades 1-3 within a 12-segment model. The accuracy of a combined predictive model (PSMA-PET and mpMRI) was determined. Receiver-operating characteristic curve analysis to determine the optimal standardized uptake value (SUVmax ) for PSMA-PET in discriminating between ISUP grades 1 and ≥2 was performed.  Results:   On a per-patient basis, the sensitivities for PSMA-PET and mpMRI in identifying ISUP grades 2-3 PCa were 100% and 97%, respectively.

The advent of robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP) has allowed technical advances in preservation and reconstruction of the anatomical structures. Despite the robotic approach, the discordant oncological and functional results between different series did not permit final conclusions.  Methods:   In our Department, starting from June 2013, we performed a total anatomical reconstruction (TAR) technique during robot-assisted RP for early recovery of urinary continence. We have retrospectively reviewed all the patients who underwent RARP with TAR procedure with a previous history of prostate surgery for BPH from June 2013 to April 2017 at our Department with a minimum follow-up period of 12 months. All the procedures considered were performed by a single surgeon (F.P.). Preoperative, intraoperative events, complications and functional and oncological results have all been collected. We found 40 patients with previous BPH surgery with adequate preoperative information and postoperative follow-up.  Results:   RARP was performed successfully in all patients without need for open conversion. No major intraoperative complications were encountered. In no cases blood transfusion was needed. All the complications recorded are Clavien grade I (20%). Continence rate at one, four, 12, 24, and 52 weeks from catheter removal was 77.5%, 82.5%, 90%, 92.5%, and 95%, respectively.

Little is known about potential long-term effects of carboplatin. We, therefore, examined late sequelae of this drug in seminoma patients.  Patients and methods:   We retrospectively identified 451 patients with CS1 testicular seminoma treated between 1994 and 2014, of whom 243 underwent carboplatin therapy [median follow-up (F/U) 96 months], 81 received radiotherapy (median F/U 142 months), and 127 underwent surveillance (median F/U 40 months). Satisfaction regarding management, as well as the following events during F/U, were analysed by questionnaire: subsequent malignant neoplasms (SMNs), cardiovascular events, arterial hypertension, peptic ulcer, tinnitus, peripheral neuropathy, hypogonadism, and infertility. The relative frequencies of the events were analysed using descriptive statistics. The frequency of observed SMNs was compared with the expected number.  Results:   Patients receiving carboplatin tolerated the treatment less well (71.2%) than those under surveillance (81.9%). After carboplatin, 12 SMNs (5.0%) were noted vis-a-vis 5.0 expected. There were three cases of prostatic cancer and 3 melanomas among the SMNs. Half of these SMNs occurred early after treatment. Among the other health events, only reported hypogonadism (13.2%) appeared to be marginally increased in frequency.  Conclusions:   This study found a 2.4-fold higher than expected rate of SMN-and a slightly increased rate of hypogonadism-in the long-term period following carboplatin treatment. Although further studies are needed to confirm these preliminary findings, these results are probably informative for clinicians caring for seminoma patients.""","""['Christian Guido Ruf', 'Stefan Borck', 'Petra Anheuser', 'Cord Matthies', 'Tim Nestler', 'Henrik Zecha', 'Hendrik Isbarn', 'Klaus-Peter Dieckmann']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""J Cancer Res Clin Oncol""","""['Re: Adjuvant Carboplatin Therapy in Patients with Clinical Stage 1 Testicular Seminoma: Is Long-Term Morbidity Increased?', 'Combination carboplatin and radiotherapy in the management of stage II testicular seminoma: comparison with radiotherapy treatment alone.', 'Management of clinical stage I testicular pure seminoma.

Methods:   This population-based cohort study used Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results - Medicare data. Eligible patients were men aged 66 or older and diagnosed with high-risk prostate cancer between 1996 and 2003. Outcomes evaluated were 10-year overall mortality and prostate cancer-specific mortality, complications, health service use, and cost. We used Cox regression, Poisson regression, and Generalized Linear Model (GLM) log-link models to assess the outcomes.  Main findings:   The 10-year overall mortality of EBRT + ADT was comparable to that of the RP group (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.09, confidence interval [CI] = 0.72-1.66). The EBRT + BT ± ADT group had overall survival advantage compared to RP (HR = 0.47, CI = 0.31-0.73). Compared to the RP group, EBRT + ADT group had higher 10-year prostate cancer-specific mortality (HR = 2.19, CI = 1.92-5.21). Both EBRT + ADT and EBRT + BT ± ADT were associated with higher 10-year cost (odds ratio = 1.72, CI = 1.35-2.20; and odds ratio = 1.63, CI = 1.29-2.04), compared to RP group. Complications and health service use varied across 3 treatment groups and across phases of care.  Principal conclusions:   Our results also demonstrate long-term overall survival benefits for EBRT + BT ± ADT, and greater bowel and bladder side effects over a decade, compared to RP. The RP group had advantage for long-term prostate-cancer specific mortality, compared to EBRT + ADT group. Thus, RP can provide superior cancer control with clear cost advantage for older men with high-risk disease. In terms of value proposition, our results support RP as preferred treatment option, compared to EBRT + ADT and EBRT + BT ± ADT for high-risk prostate cancer patients.""","""['Ravishankar Jayadevappa', 'David I Lee', 'Sumedha Chhatre', 'Thomas J Guzzo', 'Stanley B Malkowicz']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Urol Oncol""","""['Radiation therapy compared to radical prostatectomy as first-line definitive therapy for patients with high-risk localised prostate cancer: An updated systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Comparison of Multimodal Therapies and Outcomes Among Patients With High-Risk Prostate Cancer With Adverse Clinicopathologic Features.', 'Radical Prostatectomy, External Beam Radiotherapy, or External Beam Radiotherapy With Brachytherapy Boost and Disease Progression and Mortality in Patients With Gleason Score 9-10 Prostate Cancer.', 'Survival after radiotherapy vs. radical prostatectomy for unfavorable intermediate-risk prostate cancer.', 'A systematic review of randomised controlled trials of radiotherapy for localised prostate cancer.', ""Recognizing the emergency department's role in oncologic care: a review of the literature on unplanned acute care."", 'Radiation therapy compared to radical prostatectomy as first-line definitive therapy for patients with high-risk localised prostate cancer: An updated systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Metastatic progression following multimodal therapy for unfavorable-risk prostate cancer.', 'Neoadjuvant Therapy in High-Risk Prostate Cancer.', 'The efficacy and safety of radical prostatectomy and radiotherapy in high-risk prostate cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis.']"""

Our goal was to evaluate the clinical role of SPARC (secreted protein acidic and cysteine rich, osteonectin), cwcv, and kazal-like domains' proteoglycan 1 (SPOCK1) in PCa. SPOCK1 expression was studied through the immunohistochemical staining of specimens from 71 patients with PCa. The correlation between SPOCK1 expression and clinicopathological features was quantitatively analyzed. We used Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox proportional hazard models to analyze the prognostic value. Of 71 PCa patients, high SPOCK1 expression was more likely to be seen in those with an advanced stage (p = 0.018) of the disease and an advanced tumor (T) value (p = 0.014). Patients in Gleason grade groups 3 and 4 had significantly higher SPOCK1 expression (p = 0.044 and 0.003, respectively) compared to those of Gleason grade group 1. However, this trend was not observed in patients in Gleason grade group 5. For the survival analysis, although it was not statistically significant, patients with a high SPOCK1 expression had a shorter median overall survival (6.2 years) compared to those with low expression (7.8 years). High SPOCK1 expression may be related to advanced clinicopathological features and possibly a poor prognosis.

Methods:   T2w, DWI (12 b values, 0-2000 s/mm2), and T2 data sets of 62 patients with histologically confirmed PCa were acquired at 3T using surface array coils. The DWI data sets were post-processed using monoexponential and kurtosis models, while T2w was standardized to a common scale. Local statistics and 8 different radiomics/texture descriptors were utilized at different configurations to extract a total of 7105 unique per-tumor features. Regularized logistic regression with implicit feature selection and leave pair out cross validation was used to discriminate tumors with 3+3 vs >3+3 GS.  Results:   In total, 100 PCa lesions were analysed, of those 20 and 80 had GS of 3+3 and >3+3, respectively. The best model performance was obtained by selecting the top 1% features of T2w, ADCm and K with ROC AUC of 0.88 (95% CI of 0.82-0.95). Features from T2 mapping provided little added value. The most useful texture features were based on the gray-level co-occurrence matrix, Gabor transform, and Zernike moments.

Beyond the established Ga-PSMA, a novel promising PET tracer in PCa imaging is F-fluciclovine. For evaluating the advantages and disadvantages and the comparability, we conducted a prospective head-to-head comparison on F-fluciclovine and Ga-PSMA-11 in patients with biochemical recurrence of PCa.  Methods:   58 patients with biochemical recurrence of PCa after definitive primary therapy were included. Both scans were performed within a time window of mean 9.4 days. All scans were visually analyzed independently on a patient-, region- and lesion-based analysis. All the examinations were performed in the same medical department using identical scanners at any time.  Results:   The overall detection rate for PCa recurrence was 79.3% in F-fluciclovine and 82.8% in Ga-PSMA-11 (P = 0.64). Local recurrence was detected in 37.9% on F-fluciclovine and in 27.6% on Ga-PSMA-11 (P = 0.03). Local pelvic lymph node recurrence was detected on F-fluciclovine versus Ga-PSMA-11 in 46.6% versus 50%, in extrapelvic lymph node metastases in 41.4% versus 51.7% and in bone metastases in 25.9% versus 36.2%.

Methods:   The clinical data of 191 prostate cancer patients treated with definitive intensity-modulated RT were retrospectively analyzed. All patients were initially staged with thoracoabdominal CT and bone scintigraphy, and the second staging was performed using Ga-PSMA-PET/CT. Both stages were evaluated for the decision making of RT and any change in RT target volumes.  Results:   After staging with Ga-PSMA-PET/CT, 26 patients (13.6%) had risk group changes, 16 patients (8.4%) had an increase in risk group, and 10 patients (5.2%) had a decrease in risk group. Down-staging occurred in 22 patients (11.5%), and upstaging was observed in 30 patients (15.7%). A total of 26 patients (13.6%) had nodal stage changes. After the Ga-PSMA-PET/CT scans, the number of metastatic patient increased to 17 (8.9%), with 4 of them moving from oligo- to polymetastatic disease. An additional irradiation of pelvic lymphatics and metastatic site was performed in 13 patients (6.8%) and 6 patients (3.2%), respectively. The RT was aborted in 4 patients (2.1%) because of parenchymal or distant site metastasis observed in the Ga-PSMA-PET/CT.

Design:   Nationwide observational cohort study.  Method:   Data from the Netherlands Cancer Registry on standardized incidence rates and relative survival were analysed. Mortality data was obtained from Statistics Netherlands.  Results:   Between 1989 and 2017 the number of newly-diagnosed cancers doubled to 111,582. The standardized incidence (ESR) increased from 377 per 100,000 inhabitants in 1989 to 481 in 2011, and stabilized thereafter (459 in 2017). In 2018 the five most common types of cancer were skin cancer (excl. basal cell carcinoma, n = 21,000), breast cancer (n = 15,000), colorectal cancer (n = 14,000), lung cancer (n = 13,000) and prostate cancer (n = 13,000). The incidence of skin cancer rose the fastest (melanoma from 11 to 32 per 100,000; squamous cell carcinoma from 14 to 49 per 100,000). The largest shift to local disease (T1-T2 according to the TNM) was seen in breast cancer (from 50% to 75%). The 5-year survival improved from 50% in patients diagnosed with cancer in 1991-1996 to 65% in 2011-2016. Of the most common cancer types, survival of acute myeloid leukaemia increased the most (from 10% to 25%). The absolute number of deaths increased (from 35,000 in 1989 to 45,000 in 2017), but after standardization this decreased from 234 to 169.  Conclusion:   The incidence of cancer in absolute numbers is still increasing due to the ageing population. However, taking population demographics into account, the standardized incidence has not increased since 2011. This is related to the decrease in smoking-related cancers, amongst other things. The increase in survival is related to early detection and improved treatment. The decrease in mortality is mainly related to the decrease in lung cancer mortality in men.""","""['Sabine Siesling', 'Otto Visser', 'Mieke J Aarts', 'Rob H A Verhoeven', 'Katja K H Aben', 'Avinash G Dinmohamed', 'Boukje van Dijk', 'Maaike van der Aa', 'Marieke Louwman', 'Valery E P P Lemmens']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Ned Tijdschr Geneeskd""","""['Italian cancer figures--Report 2015: The burden of rare cancers in Italy.', 'Trends of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma in the Netherlands: increased incidence rates, but stable relative survival and mortality 1989-2008.', 'Cancer in the very elderly Dutch population.', 'Predictions of skin cancer incidence in the Netherlands up to 2015.', 'Incidence and trends of cutaneous malignancies in the Netherlands, 1989-2005.', 'Cutaneous metastases of internal malignancies: a single-institution experience.', 'The effects of new life-prolonging drugs for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) patients in a real-world population.']"""

We reported previously that the SFK LynA is uniquely susceptible to rapid ubiquitin-mediated degradation in macrophages, functioning as a rheostat regulating signaling (Freedman et al., 2015). We now report the mechanism by which LynA is preferentially targeted for degradation and how cell specificity is built into the LynA rheostat. Using genetic, biochemical, and quantitative phosphopeptide analyses, we found that the E3 ubiquitin ligase c-Cbl preferentially targets LynA via a phosphorylated tyrosine (Y32) in its unique region. This distinct mode of c-Cbl recognition depresses steady-state expression of LynA in macrophages derived from mice. Mast cells, however, express little c-Cbl and have correspondingly high LynA. Upon activation, mast-cell LynA is not rapidly degraded, and SFK-mediated signaling is amplified relative to macrophages.

Cell migration was accelerated by IL-17, which was abolished by knockdown of MTA1 expression with small interference RNA (siRNA). Further, cell invasion was enhanced by IL-17, which was eliminated by MTA1 knockdown. Human cervical intra-epithelial neoplasia (CIN) and cervical cancer tissues had increased number of IL-17-positive cells and MTA1 expression compared to normal cervical tissues.

With the aim to optimize target-to-background uptake ratio in 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET, we investigated the image quality and quantitative measures of regularized reconstruction by block-sequential regularized expectation maximization (BSREM). Methods: The study encompassed retrospective reconstruction and analysis of 20 digital time-of-flight (TOF) PET/CT examinations acquired 60 min post injection of 2 MBq/kg of 68Ga-PSMA-11 in PCa patients with biochemical relapse after primary treatment. Reconstruction by ordered-subsets expectation maximization (OSEM; 3 iterations, 16 subsets, 5 mm gaussian postprocessing filter) and BSREM (β-values of 100-1600) were used, both including TOF and point spread function (PSF) recovery. Background variability (BV) was measured by placing a spherical volume of interest in the right liver lobe and defined as the standard deviation divided by the mean standardized uptake value (SUV). The image quality was evaluated in terms of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and signal-to-background ratio (SBR), using SUVmax of the lesions. A visual assessment was performed by four observers. Results: OSEM reconstruction produced images with a BV of 15%, whereas BSREM with a β-value above 300 resulted in lower BVs than OSEM (36% with β 100, 8% with β 1300). Decreasing the acquisition duration from 2 to 1 and 0.5 min per bed position increased BV for both reconstruction methods, although BSREM with β-values equal to or higher than 800 and 1200, respectively, kept the BV below 15%. In comparison of BSREM with OSEM, the mean SNR improved by 25 to 66% with an increasing β-value in the range of 200-1300, whereas the mean SBR decreased with an increasing β-value, ranging from 0 to 125% with a β-value of 100 and 900, respectively. Decreased acquisition duration resulted in β-values of 800 to 1000 and 1200 to 1400 for 1 and 0.5 min per bed position, respectively, producing improved image quality measures compared with OSEM at a full acquisition duration of 2 min per bed position. The observer study showed a slight overall preference for BSREM β 900 although the interobserver variability was high.

However, genomic and phenotypic heterogeneity remains a major challenge for effective detection and treatment of PCa. Efforts to better classify PCa into functional subtypes and elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying prostate tumorigenesis and therapy resistance are warranted for further improvement of PCa outcomes. Methods: We generated Cre+;Runx2-cTg;Ptenp/+ (Runx2-Pten double mutant) mice by crossbreeding Cre+;Runx2-cTg males with Pten conditional (Ptenp/p) females. By using Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) staining, SMA and Masson's Trichrome staining, we investigated the effect of PTEN haploinsufficiency in combination with Runx2 overexpression on prostate tumorigenesis. Moreover, we employed immunohistochemistry (IHC) to stain Ki67 for cell proliferation, cleaved caspase 3 for apoptosis and AKT phosphorylation for signaling pathway in prostate tissues. Chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled quantitative PCR (ChIP-qPCR), reverse transcription coupled quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR), western blot (WB) analyses and immunofluorescence (IF) were conducted to determine the underlying mechanism by which RUNX2 regulates CXCR7 and AKT phosphorylation in PCa cells. Results: We demonstrated that mice with prostate-specific Pten heterozygous deletion and Runx2 overexpression developed high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (HGPIN) and cancerous lesions at age younger than one year, with concomitant high level expression of Akt phosphorylation and the chemokine receptor Cxcr7 in malignant glands. RUNX2 overexpression induced CXCR7 transcription and membrane location and AKT phosphorylation in PTEN-deficient human PCa cell lines. Increased expression of RUNX2 also promoted growth of PCa cells and this effect was largely mediated by CXCR7. CXCR7 expression also positively correlated with AKT phosphorylation in PCa patient specimens. Conclusions: Our results reveal a previously unidentified cooperative role of RUNX2 overexpression and PTEN haploinsufficiency in prostate tumorigenesis, suggesting that the defined RUNX2-CXCR7-AKT axis can be a viable target for effective treatment of PCa.""","""['Yang Bai', 'Yinhui Yang', 'Yuqian Yan', 'Jian Zhong', 'Alexandra M Blee', 'Yunqian Pan', 'Tao Ma', 'R Jeffrey Karnes', 'Rafael Jimenez', 'Wanhai Xu', 'Haojie Huang']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Theranostics""","""['Depletion of SAG/RBX2 E3 ubiquitin ligase suppresses prostate tumorigenesis via inactivation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR axis.', 'PTEN Loss Promotes Intratumoral Androgen Synthesis and Tumor Microenvironment Remodeling via Aberrant Activation of RUNX2 in Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Akt-mediated phosphorylation of Bmi1 modulates its oncogenic potential, E3 ligase activity, and DNA damage repair activity in mouse prostate cancer.', 'Interplay Among PI3K/AKT, PTEN/FOXO and AR Signaling in Prostate Cancer.', 'Role of lncRNAs in prostate cancer development and progression.', 'Chemokine receptor CXCR7 activates Aurora Kinase A and promotes neuroendocrine prostate cancer growth.', 'Runt-related transcription factors in human carcinogenesis: a friend or foe?', 'CXCR7 as a novel therapeutic target for advanced prostate cancer.', 'miR-218-5p/RUNX2 Axis Positively Regulates Proliferation and Is Associated with Poor Prognosis in Cervical Cancer.', 'RUNX2 recruits the NuRD(MTA1)/CRL4B complex to promote breast cancer progression and bone metastasis.']"""

Patients and methods:   We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 150 patients with PCa treated with ADT at our hospital between June 2011 and June 2017. PPFT measured on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and PPFT/periprostatic fat volume (PPFV) measured on computed tomography (CT) were evaluated. Kaplan-Meier curves and log-rank tests were used to assess significant differences in time to CRPC between the 2 groups (high PPFT vs. low PPFT, determined by PPFT > or < the median value, respectively). Univariable and multivariable Cox regression analyses were employed to identify the potential prognostic factors for survival.  Results:   The median value of PPFT measured on MRI was 0.555 cm. PPFT was significantly associated with PPFV measured on CT images (with a correlation coefficient of 0.825; P < .001). A total of 66 patients (44%) progressed to CRPC during the follow-up period. Patients with high PPFT (measured on MRI) showed a significantly shorter PFS than patients with low PPFT. Multivariable Cox analysis demonstrated that T stage, presence of distant metastasis, shorter time to prostate-specific antigen nadir, higher prostate-specific antigen nadir, Gleason score (greater than 4 + 4), and high PPFT were significantly associated with shorter PFS.

Objective:   We sought to identify early detection biomarkers for endometrial cancer using prediagnostic serum.  Study design:   We performed a nested case-control study of postmenopausal women in the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian cancer screening trial (n = 78,216), including 112 incident endometrial cancer cases and 112 controls. Prediagnostic serum was immunodepleted of high-abundance proteins and digested with sequencing grade porcine trypsin via pressure cycling technology. Quantitative proteomics and phosphoproteomics was performed using high-resolution liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry and highly multiplexed isobaric mass tag combined with basic reversed-phase liquid chromatography. A set of proteins able to predict cancer status was identified with an integrated score assessed by receiver-operator curve analysis.  Results:   Mean time from blood draw to endometrial cancer diagnosis was 3.5 years (SD, 1.9 years). There were 47 differentially abundant proteins between cases and controls (P < .05). Protein alterations with high predictive potential were selected by regression analysis and compiled into an aggregate score to determine the ability to predict endometrial cancer. An integrated risk score of 6 proteins was directly related to disease incidence in cases with blood draw ≤2 years, >2 years to ≤5 years or >5 years prior to cancer diagnosis. The integrated score distinguished cases from controls with an area under the curve of 0.80 (95% confidence interval, 0.72-0.88).

Immunotherapeutic approaches, including DNA vaccination, hold the potential to harness the host's own immune system to mount a cell-mediated, anti-tumour response, capable of clearing disseminated tumour deposits. These anti-cancer vaccines represent a promising strategy for patients with advanced disease, however, to date DNA vaccines have demonstrated limited efficacy in clinical trials, owing to the lack of a suitable DNA delivery system. This study was designed to evaluate the efficacy of a two-tier delivery system incorporating cationic RALA/pDNA nanoparticles (NPs) into a dissolvable microneedle (MN) patch for the purposes of DNA vaccination against prostate cancer. Application of NP-loaded MN patches successfully resulted in endogenous production of the encoded Prostate Stem Cell Antigen (PSCA). Furthermore, immunisation with RALA/pPSCA loaded MNs elicited a tumour-specific immune response against TRAMP-C1 tumours ex vivo. Finally, vaccination with RALA/pPSCA loaded MNs demonstrated anti-tumour activity in both prophylactic and therapeutic prostate cancer models in vivo. This is further evidence that this two-tier MN delivery system is a robust platform for prostate cancer DNA vaccination. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: This research describes the development and utilisation of our unique microneedle (MN) DNA delivery system, which enables penetration through the stratum corneum and deposition of the DNA within the highly immunogenic skin layers via a dissolvable MN matrix, and facilitates cellular uptake via complexation of pDNA cargo into nanoparticles (NPs) with the RALA delivery peptide. We report for the first time on using the NP-MN platform to immunise mice with encoded Prostate Stem Cell Antigen (mPSCA) for prostate cancer DNA vaccination. Application of the NP-MN system resulted in local mPSCA expression in vivo. Furthermore, immunisation with the NP-MN system induced a tumour-specific cellular immune response, and inhibited the growth of TRAMP-C1 prostate tumours in both prophylactic and therapeutic challenge models in vivo.""","""['Grace Cole', 'Ahlam A Ali', 'Emma McErlean', 'Eoghan J Mulholland', 'Amy Short', 'Cian M McCrudden', 'Joanne McCaffrey', 'Tracy Robson', 'Vicky L Kett', 'Jonathan A Coulter', 'Nicholas J Dunne', 'Ryan F Donnelly', 'Helen O McCarthy']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Acta Biomater""","""['Immunization with recombinant DNA and modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) vectors delivering PSCA and STEAP1 antigens inhibits prostate cancer progression.', 'DNA vaccination for cervical cancer: Strategic optimisation of RALA mediated gene delivery from a biodegradable microneedle system.', 'DNA vaccination for cervical cancer; a novel technology platform of RALA mediated gene delivery via polymeric microneedles.', 'Microneedle arrays for vaccine delivery: the possibilities, challenges and use of nanoparticles as a combinatorial approach for enhanced vaccine immunogenicity.', 'DNA vaccine for cancer immunotherapy.', 'Responsive Microneedles as a New Platform for Precision Immunotherapy.', 'Nanomedicine for Combination Urologic Cancer Immunotherapy.', 'Microneedle-mediated treatment for superficial tumors by combining multiple strategies.', 'Systematic pan-cancer analysis identifies RALA as a tumor targeting immune therapeutic and prognostic marker.', 'Nucleic acid vaccination strategies for ovarian cancer.']"""

There is an urgent need to seek alternative strategies to cure this lethal disease. Activation of lipogenesis has been demonstrated to lead to PCa progression. Therefore, targeting the aberrant lipogenic activity could be developed therapeutically in PCa. The aim of this study is to investigate the molecular basis and efficacy of osajin, a bioactive prenylated isoflavonoid, in PCa.  Methods:   PCa cells, LNCaP (androgen-sensitive) and C4-2 (androgen-insensitive/castration-resistant), were used in this study. Proliferation, migration, and invasion analyses were conducted by the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) method, a wound healing assay, and the transwell method. Lipogenesis was determined by a Fatty Acid Quantification Kit and oil red O staining. Apoptosis was assessed by annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate/propidium iodide staining, caspase enzymatic activity, and Western blot analyses.  Results:   Osajin inhibited fatty acid synthase (FASN) expression, a key enzyme for lipogenesis, in PCa cells. By inhibiting FASN, osajin decreased the fatty-acid levels and lipid accumulation. Significantly, osajin downregulated androgen receptor (AR) and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) in PCa cells. Moreover, osajin suppressed PCa cell growth, migration, and invasion. Through activation of the caspase-dependent pathway, osajin induced apoptosis in PCa cells.  Conclusions:   These data provide a novel molecular basis of osajin in PCa cells, and cotargeting lipogenesis and the AR axis via impairment of FASN and AR expression by osajin could be applied as a new and promising approach for the treatment of malignant PCa.""","""['Shih-Yin Huang', 'Guan-Jhong Huang', 'Po-Fan Hsieh', 'Hsi-Chin Wu', 'Wen-Chin Huang']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Novel Strategy of Proxalutamide for the Treatment of Prostate Cancer through Coordinated Blockade of Lipogenesis and Androgen Receptor Axis.', 'Cell suspension culture extract of Eriobotrya japonica attenuates growth and induces apoptosis in prostate cancer cells via targeting SREBP-1/FASN-driven metabolism and AR.', 'Targeting fatty acid synthase with ASC-J9 suppresses proliferation and invasion of prostate cancer cells.', 'EAU guidelines on prostate cancer.

Adhesion to human vascular endothelium or immobilized collagen was then explored. The influence of amygdalin on chemotaxis and migration was also investigated, as well as amygdalin induced alteration to surface and total cellular α and β integrin expression. Integrin knockdown was performed to evaluate the integrin influence on chemotaxis and adhesion. Amygdalin significantly reduced chemotactic activity, migration, and adhesion of DU-145 but not of PC3 cells. Amygdalin elevated integrin α2 in both cell lines. Integrin α6 was reduced by amygdalin only in DU-145 cells, whereas β1 increased only in PC3 cells. Functional blocking revealed a negative association of α2 with PC3 and DU-145 chemotaxis. The β1 increase correlated with enhanced chemotaxis, the diminished α6 expression with reduced chemotaxis. Amygdalin acted on prostate cancer cells in vitro.

The present study aims to identify the expression of microRNA-539 (miR-539) in PCa and further investigate its functional relevance in PCa progression both in vitro and in vivo. Initially, microarray analysis was conducted to obtain the differentially expressed gene candidates and the regulatory miRNAs, after which the possible interaction between the two was determined. Next, ectopic expression and knock-down of the levels of miR-539 were performed in PCa cells to identify the functional role of miR-539 in PCa pathogenesis, followed by the measurement of E-cadherin, vimentin, Smad4, c-Myc, Snail1 and SLUG expression, as well as proliferation, migration and invasion of PCa cells. Finally, tumour growth was evaluated in nude mice through in vivo experiments. The results found that miR-539 was down-regulated and DLX1 was up-regulated in PCa tissues and cells. miR-539 was also found to target and negatively regulate DLX1 expression, which resulted in the inhibition of the TGF-β/Smad4 signalling pathway. Moreover, the up-regulation of miR-539 or DLX1 gene silencing led to the inhibition of PCa cell proliferation, migration, invasion, EMT and tumour growth, accompanied by increased E-cadherin expression and decreased expression of vimentin, Smad4, c-Myc, Snail1 and SLUG. In conclusion, the overexpression of miR-539-mediated DLX1 inhibition could potentially impede EMT, proliferation, migration and invasion of PCa cells through the blockade of the TGF-β/Smad4 signalling pathway, highlighting a potential miR-539/DLX1/TGF-β/Smad4 regulatory axis in the treatment of PCa.""","""['Baogang Sun', 'Yingying Fan', 'Aijun Yang', 'Lunan Liang', 'Jinghe Cao']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""J Cell Mol Med""","""['MicroRNA-506 inhibits tumor growth and metastasis in nasopharyngeal carcinoma through the inactivation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway by down-regulating LHX2.', 'Role of miR-218-GREM1 axis in epithelial-mesenchymal transition of oral squamous cell carcinoma: An in vivo and vitro study based on microarray data.', 'MicroRNA-362 negatively and positively regulates SMAD4 expression in TGF-β/SMAD signaling to suppress cell migration and invasion.', 'Stromal-induced downregulation of miR-1247 promotes prostate cancer malignancy.', 'Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) in prostate cancer: A dual function mediator?', 'Identification and validation of DLX4 as a prognostic and diagnostic biomarker for clear cell renal cell carcinoma.', 'Polysaccharides Extracted from Angelica sinensis (Oliv.)

Patients and methods:   Real-time PCR was performed to detect the expressions of FEZF1-AS1 in PCa specimens and cell lines. Correlations between G- FEZF1-AS1 expressions and clinical characteristics and overall survivals were determined using statistical methods. The CCK-8 assays, colony formation assay, flow cytometry, transwell, and wound scratch assays were carried out to study cells viability, cells migration, and invasion.

Results:   We found that FEZF1-AS1 expressions were distinctly reduced in human PCa tissues and cell lines compared with their non-tumor counterparts, and its higher levels were strongly associated with lymph node metastasis (p=0.012) and Angiolymphatic invasion (p=0.022). Then, Kaplan-Meier assays showed that patients with higher expressions of FEZF1-AS1 were shown to predict unfavorable overall survival. Cox proportional hazards risks assays revealed that FEZF1-AS1 acted as an independent prognostic factor for PCa. Functional investigations suggested that knockdown of FEZF1-AS1 could suppress cells proliferation, trigger late apoptosis, and inhibit cells invasion and migration.

Conventionally fractionated patients received 74-80 Gy and hypofractionated patients received 65-75.2 Gy. A large majority of the patients were treated with intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT). Dose-surface maps (DSMs) for the anal canal and rectum as a single structure, and for the anal canal and the rectum separately, were co-registered rigidly in two dimensions and, for the patients with and without toxicity, respectively, the mean value of the dose in each pixel was calculated. A pixel-wise t-test was used to highlight the anatomical areas where there was a significant difference between the 'mean dose maps' of each group. Univariate models were also fitted to a range of spatial parameters. The endpoints considered were a mean grade ≥1 late fecal incontinence and a maximum grade ≥2 late rectal bleeding.Results: Twenty-six out of 213 patients had fecal incontinence, while 21/225 patients had rectal bleeding. Incontinence was associated with a higher dose in the caudal region of the anal canal; the most relevant spatial parameter was the lateral extent of the low and medium isodoses (5-49 Gy in EQD2). Bleeding was associated with high isodoses reaching the posterior rectal wall. The spatial dose parameters with the highest AUC value (.69) were the lateral extent of the 60-70 Gy isodoses.Conclusions: To avoid fecal incontinence it is important to limit the portion of the anal canal irradiated.

In clinical practice, enzalutamide demonstrates a good benefit-risk profile for the treatment of advanced prostate cancer (PC), even after poor response to standard antihormonal treatment. However, since both, well-established antiandrogens and enzalutamide, target AR functionality, we hypothesized that additional unknown mechanisms might be responsible for enzalutamide's superior anticancer activity. In the current study, PC cells were incubated with enzalutamide and enzalutamide-dependent modulation of apoptotic mechanisms were assessed via Western blot analysis, TDT-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end-labeling assay, and nuclear morphology assay. Alterations of heat shock protein (HSP), AR, and estrogen receptor (ER) expression were examined by Western blot analysis. Enzalutamide attenuated the proliferation of PC cells in a time- and dose-dependent manner. In the presence of enzalutamide, apoptosis occurred which was shown by increased BAX expression, decreased Bcl-2 expression, nuclear pyknosis, and genomic DNA fragmentation. Moreover, enzalutamide inhibited the expression of HSPs primarily involved in steroid receptor stabilization and suppressed AR and ERβ1 expression. This study demonstrates for the first time that enzalutamide treatment of PC cells triggers varying molecular mechanisms resulting in antiproliferative effects of the drug. In addition to the well-characterized antagonistic inhibition of AR functionality, we have shown that enzalutamide also affects the intracellular synthesis of steroid receptor-associated HSPs, thereby diminishing the expression of AR and ERβ1 proteins and inducing apoptotic pathways. According to an indirect attenuation of HSP-associated factors such as steroid receptors, endometrial carcinoma, uterine leiomyosarcoma, and mamma carcinoma cells also demonstrated inhibited cell growth in the presence of enzalutamide.

The androgen receptor (AR) is expressed in about 90% of ERα-positive patients, with particularly high expression in tamoxifen-resistant tumours. Prostate-derived Ets factor (PDEF), which is a co-regulator of AR, plays a role in tamoxifen resistance in ERα-positive BC. The purpose of this research was to analyse the potential roles of AR, PDEF and ERα levels in the response to tamoxifen resistance in ERα-positive BC.  Methods:   The nuclear AR:ERα and PDEF:ERα ratios were examined immunohistochemically in a cohort of 225 ERα-positive pre-menopausal BC patients who had received adjuvant tamoxifen therapy.  Results:   For both AR:ERα and PDEF:ERα ratios, the optimal cutoff value was 2.0. Patients receiving adjuvant tamoxifen treatment who had a high AR:ERα (≥ 2.0) (HR = 3.90) or PDEF:ERα ratio (≥ 2.0) (HR = 2.77) had a beyond twofold increased risk of failure.

However, its expression level and potential role in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) remain uncertain.  Results:   Here, we found that miR-216a-5p expression was significantly down-regulated in clinical ESCC tissues and cells. Functional assays were performed to evaluate the biological effects of miR-216a-5p on cell proliferation and cell apoptosis by CCK-8 assay and flow cytometry in ESCC cell lines, EC9706 and TE-9. The results showed that miR-216a-5p overexpression repressed cell proliferation and induced cell apoptosis. Through bioinformatics prediction and luciferase reporter assay, we revealed that miR-216a-5p could directly target tectonic family member 1 (TCTN1). Moreover, TCTN1 was obviously suppressed by miR-216a-5p overexpression. In addition, TCTN1 expression was significantly increased and inversely correlated with the levels of miR-216a-5p in ESCC tissues. More importantly, down-regulation of TCTN1 imitated, while restoration of TCTN reversed the effects of miR-216a-5p on cell proliferation and apoptosis. At the molecular level, we further found that TCTN1 overexpression reversed the effects of miR-216a-5p transfection on the expression of PCNA, Bcl-2 and Bad.  Conclusions:   Our results demonstrate that miR-216a-5p might serve as a tumor suppressor in ESCC cells through negatively regulating TCTN1 expression, indicating the possibility that miR-216a-5p and TCTN1 might be attractive targets for ESCC therapeutic intervention.""","""['Lixun Chai', 'Gengpu Yang']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Cell Mol Biol Lett""","""['Molecular mechanisms of microRNA-216a during tumor progression.', 'MiR-106b-5p regulates esophageal squamous cell carcinoma progression by binding to HPGD.', 'Silencing of Long Noncoding RNA SNHG6 Inhibits Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma Progression via miR-186-5p/HIF1α Axis.', 'Circular RNA hsa_circ_0000654 promotes esophageal squamous cell carcinoma progression by regulating the miR-149-5p/IL-6/STAT3 pathway.', 'Expression of microRNA-17-5p in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma and its effects on cell proliferation and invasion.', 'Molecular mechanisms of microRNA-216a during tumor progression.', 'Downregulation of long noncoding RNA HCP5/miR-216a-5p/ZEB1 axis inhibits the malignant biological function of laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma cells.', 'LncRNA HCP5 enhances the proliferation and migration of cervical cancer via miR-216a-5p/CDC42 axis.', 'Function and transcriptional regulation of TCTN1 in oral squamous cell carcinoma.', 'Selenium-associated differentially expressed microRNAs and their targeted mRNAs across the placental genome in two U.S. birth cohorts.']"""

Clinically ascertained pedigrees may have unknown ascertainment biases for both patients and relatives. We used a method to assess gene and variant risk and ascertainment bias based on comparing the number of observed disease instances in a pedigree given the sex and ages of individuals with those expected given established population incidence. We assessed the performance characteristics of the method by simulating families with varying genetic risk and proportion of individuals genotyped. We implemented this method using SEER cancer incidence data to assess clinical ascertainment bias in a set of 42 pedigrees with clinical testing ordered for either breast/ovarian cancer or colorectal/endometrial cancer at the University of Washington and negative sequencing results. In addition to expected biases consistent with the stated testing purpose, there were trends suggesting increased colorectal and endometrial cancer in pedigrees tested for breast cancer risk and trends suggesting increased breast cancer in families tested for colon cancer risk. There was no observed selection bias for prostate cancer in this set of families. This analysis illustrates that clinically ascertained data sets may have subtle biases. In the future, researchers seeking to explore risk associations with clinical data sets could assess potential ascertainment bias by comparing incidence of disease in families that test negative under given ordering criteria to expected population disease frequencies. Failure to assess for ascertainment bias increases the risk of false genetic associations.""","""['John Michael O Ranola', 'Ginger J Tsai', 'Brian H Shirts']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Eur J Hum Genet""","""['Sex ratio distortion in offspring of families with BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutant alleles: an ascertainment bias phenomenon?', 'Cancer risk estimates for BRCA1 mutation carriers identified in a risk evaluation program.', 'Risk of ovarian cancer and genetic relationship to other cancers in families.', 'BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations in breast and ovarian cancer syndrome: reflection on the Creighton University historical series of high risk families.', 'Breast & ovarian cancer.

Aminopeptidase P2 (XPNPEP2) is a receptor for TMTP1 tumor-homing peptide. However, the biological and clinical significance of Aminopeptidase P2 in human cancers remains unknown. In this study, the high-density multiple organ tumor tissue array was employed for the analysis of XPNPEP2 expression profiles in human specimens. The results showed that XPNPEP2 was moderately expressed in the normal prostate tissues, but significantly decreased in the prostate cancer. Hence we used TCGA, IHC, and ELISA to further analyze the expression of XPNPEP2 in tissues and serum of prostate cancer patients. In general, XPNPEP2 expression was lower in prostate cancer tissue than in normal prostate tissue, but was higher in prostate cancer tissues with local invasion and LN metastasis than in tissues with localized Pca. Western blot clarified XPNPEP2 had a secreted form in the serum. Then the serums of 128 Pca patients, 70 healthy males and 40 prostate hyperplasia patients were obtained for detecting serum XPNPEP2 levels.The results indicated that the concentration of XPNPEP2 in serums of Pca patients with LN metastasis (142.7 ± 14.40 ng/mL) were significantly higher than levels in Pca patients without LN metastasis (61.63 ± 5.50 ng/mL) (p < 0.01). An ROC analysis revealed that the combination of PSA and XPNPEP2 was more efficient than PSA or XPNPEP2 alone for predicting LN metastasis, especially for Pca patients with low serum PSA levels. In summary, serum XPNPEP2 levels when combined with PSA levels may result in increased sensitivity for predicting LN metastasis in Pca patients, especially for patients with low serum PSA levels.""","""['Fei Li', 'Yun Dai', 'Hao Xu', 'Kecheng Huang', 'Ying Zhou', 'Danfeng Luo', 'Ding Ma', 'Ling Xi', 'Mengqin Lv', 'Xiangyi Ma']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Sci Rep""","""['D-PCa-2: a novel transcript highly overexpressed in human prostate and prostate cancer.', 'More advantages in detecting bone and soft tissue metastases from prostate cancer using 18F-PSMA PET/CT.', 'Evaluation of Vitronectin Expression in Prostate Cancer and the Clinical Significance of the Association of Vitronectin Expression with Prostate Specific Antigen in Detecting Prostate Cancer.', 'Urinary microRNA-based signature improves accuracy of detection of clinically relevant prostate cancer within the prostate-specific antigen grey zone.', 'Prostate cancer: Molecular lymph node analysis for prognostication.', 'Tumor-Derived Exosomes Modulate Primary Site Tumor Metastasis.', 'TMTP1-Modified, Tumor Microenvironment Responsive Nanoparticles Co-Deliver Cisplatin and Paclitaxel Prodrugs for Effective Cervical Cancer Therapy.', 'Identification of DEGs and transcription factors involved in H. pylori-associated inflammation and their relevance with gastric cancer.']"""

The captured-EVs were detected either with Eu3+-chelate or Eu3+-doped nanoparticle-based labels conjugated either to antibodies against the tetraspanins or lectins targeting the glycan moieties on EVs surface. The NP-TRFIA demonstrated specific capturing and detection of EVs by antibodies and lectins. Lectin-nanoparticle based assays showed 2-10 fold higher signal-to-background ratio compared with lectin-chelate assays. The nanoparticle assay concept allowed surface glycosylation profiling of the urine derived-EVs with lectins. It was also applied to establish an assay showing differential expression of tumor-associated proteins on more aggressive (higher ITGA3 on DU145- and PC3-EVs) compared to less aggressive (higher EpCAM on LNCaP-EVs) PCa- cell lines derived-EVs.

In this phase II trial, loss of PTEN was a biomarker predictive of response to combined AKT and AR inhibition. Given that PTEN loss prostate cancers are significantly enriched for ERG genomic rearrangements, we evaluated how the aberrant expression of ERG may impact response to PI3K/AR-targeted therapy. Here, we show that overexpression of ERG in the setting of Pten loss promotes resistance to combined PI3K and AR pathway inhibition with associated maintenance of AR target gene expression. Importantly, following AR knockout in the setting of ERG overexpression, there is maintenance of a subset of AR lineage-specific target genes, making AR dispensable in this context. This has important clinical implications as even in the setting of the androgen-regulated TMPRSS2:ERG genomic rearrangement, ERG expression is never abolished following AR inhibition and may allow for cell survival following AR (lineage)-targeted therapies.""","""['Ninghui Mao', 'Dong Gao', 'Wenhuo Hu', 'Haley Hieronymus', 'Shangqian Wang', 'Young Sun Lee', 'Cindy Lee', 'Danielle Choi', 'Anuradha Gopalan', 'Yu Chen', 'Brett S Carver']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Mol Cancer Ther""","""['TMPRSS2-ERG Controls Luminal Epithelial Lineage and Antiandrogen Sensitivity in PTEN and TP53-Mutated Prostate Cancer.', 'Oncogenic ERG Represses PI3K Signaling through Downregulation of IRS2.', 'TMPRSS2-ERG fusions confer efficacy of enzalutamide in an in vivo bone tumor growth model.', 'Role of PI3K-AKT-mTOR Pathway as a Pro-Survival Signaling and Resistance-Mediating Mechanism to Therapy of Prostate Cancer.', 'Interplay Among PI3K/AKT, PTEN/FOXO and AR Signaling in Prostate Cancer.', 'The Expression of Proto-Oncogene ETS-Related Gene (ERG) Plays a Central Role in the Oncogenic Mechanism Involved in the Development and Progression of Prostate Cancer.', 'Allosteric interactions prime androgen receptor dimerization and activation.', 'SPP1 Promotes Enzalutamide Resistance and Epithelial-Mesenchymal-Transition Activation in Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer via PI3K/AKT and ERK1/2 Pathways.', 'Rapid interrogation of cancer cell of origin through CRISPR editing.', 'Androgen Receptor Signaling in Prostate Cancer Genomic Subtypes.']"""

Objective:   To examine the performance of MRI/ultrasound fusion-guided TB in combination with SB in the detection of PCa in patients with and without prior biopsy.  Design, setting, and participants:   A total of 219 men undergoing combined transrectal TB and 12-core SB from February 2014 to November 2018 were analysed. For all patients showing a suspicion of PCa in multiparametric MRI, TB was performed using fusion imaging with real-time virtual sonography.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Cancer detection rates (CDRs) and significant CDRs for TB, SB, and TB+SB were analysed. Further stratification was performed for a number of previous biopsy sessions and Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) score. Significant PCa was defined as any PCa with Gleason score ≥3+4.  Results and limitations:   Of all, 141 patients were biopsy naïve, while 78 patients had at least one prior biopsy. Median prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level prior to biopsy was 8.4ng/ml (interquartile range 5.5-11.8ng/ml). The overall CDR was 63.5% (139/219), while the PI-RADS-dependent CDRs for the combination of TB+SB were 29.1%, 67.7%, and 86.2% for patients with PI-RADS 3, 4, and 5, respectively. Looking at TB or SB alone, CDRs were 55.7% and 57.5%. The overall CDR for significant PCa was 51.6%. (18.2%, 50.5%, and 81.5% for PI-RADS 3, 4, and 5, respectively). CDRs were significantly higher for biopsy-naïve patients (65.2% vs 67.4% vs 71.6% for TB vs SB vs TB+SB) than for patients with one previous negative biopsy (38.2% vs 43.6% vs 50.9% for TB vs SB vs TB+SB; all p<0.01).  Conclusions:   Multiparametric MRI can raise the CDR in patients with and without biopsies performed earlier. With higher PI-RADS lesions, the risk of harbouring PCa increases. Combining TB with SB further improved the diagnostic accuracy in biopsy-naïve patients and after one previous negative biopsy.  Patient summary:   Multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging before prostate biopsy increases cancer detection rates in biopsy-naïve patients and patients with a previous negative biopsy. The combination of targeted biopsy with systematic biopsy improved the diagnostic accuracy in biopsy-naïve patients and after one previous negative biopsy.""","""['Felix Preisser', 'Lena Theissen', 'Mike Wenzel', 'Clara Humke', 'Boris Bodelle', 'Jens Köllermann', 'Luis Kluth', 'Severine Banek', 'Andreas Becker', 'Frederik Roos', 'Felix K-H Chun', 'Philipp Mandel']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Eur Urol Focus""","""['Is There Still a Need for Repeated Systematic Biopsies in Patients with Previous Negative Biopsies in the Era of Magnetic Resonance Imaging-targeted Biopsies of the Prostate?', 'Primary magnetic resonance imaging/ultrasonography fusion-guided biopsy of the prostate.', 'Assessment of free-hand transperineal targeted prostate biopsy using multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging-transrectal ultrasound fusion in Chinese men with prior negative biopsy and elevated prostate-specific antigen.', 'Significance of MRI/Transrectal Ultrasound Fusion Three-Dimensional Model-Guided, Targeted Biopsy Based on Transrectal Ultrasound-Guided Systematic Biopsy in Prostate Cancer Detection: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.', 'The value of magnetic resonance imaging and ultrasonography (MRI/US)-fusion biopsy platforms in prostate cancer detection: a systematic review.', 'Combining targeted and systematic prostate biopsy improves prostate cancer detection and correlation with the whole mount histopathology in biopsy naïve and previous negative biopsy patients.', 'Pathological Accuracy in Prostate Cancer: Single-Center Outcomes of 3 Different Magnetic Resonance Imaging-Targeted Biopsy Techniques and Random Systematic Biopsy.', 'Full functional-length urethral sphincter- and neurovascular bundle preservation improves long-term continence rates after robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy.', 'Evidence-based guideline recommendations on multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging in the diagnosis of clinically significant prostate cancer: A Cancer Care Ontario updated clinical practice guideline.', 'A Prospective Study and Single-Center Experience: Effectivity of Fusion Prostate Biopsy in Biopsy-Naïve Patients.']"""

Materials and methods:   Prostatectomy cases in the NCDB from 2004 to 2013 were included. Lymphadenectomy extent was defined by the number of nodes examined. Logistic regression was used to identify risk factors for the top quartile of lymph node count and pN1 disease. This model was created to estimate the expected prevalence of pN1, and generated observed over expected ratios. A Cox regression model was used to evaluate the effect of lymph node count on overall survival.  Results:   Lymphadenectomy was performed in 209,789 (60%) of 358,522 surgeries, with pN1 in 6,428 (3.08%). Increasing quartiles for lymph node count was associated with pN1 (3-5 nodes OR 2.11; 6-8 nodes OR 3.12; ≥9 nodes OR 5.91, all P< 0.001). The logistic regression model suggested that 59% of pN1 cases are missed due to low lymph node count. Increased lymph node count was associated with increasing pN1 detection (O/E: 1-2 nodes = 0.18; 3-5 nodes = 0.37; 6-8 nodes = 0.56; ≥9 nodes = 1.01). Cox proportional hazards modeling demonstrated that the top quartile for lymph node count had improved overall survival (HR 0.93, CI 0.87-0.99, P= 0.03).

Materials and methods:   Fifteen imaging sites in the region submitted seven consecutive anonymised MRI studies. These were assessed by two experienced radiologists in consensus. Overall, subjective image quality for T2-weighted imaging (T2W), diffusion weighted imaging (DWI), and dynamic contrast enhancement (DCE) was scored on a five-point Likert scale. Five additional quality parameters were also assessed visually, including image noise, motion, artefact, and distortion. The degree of compliance by each site with 21 published technical standards was also assessed.  Results:   Ninety-four MRI examinations were reviewed from across all sites (mean 6.3 scans per site, range 5-7). Mean compliance with technical standards was 63% (range 38-86%). Forty-seven percent of sites did not perform DCE. One site used a 3 T scanner. The percentage of patients with overall quality scores of ≥3 (diagnostically acceptable) were 68% for T2W, 81% for DWI, and 60% for both T2W and DWI. Ninety-three percent of the 45 patients who underwent DCE had diagnostically acceptable studies.

The aim of this study was to develop a PDA for prostate cancer that is accurate and user-friendly.  Methods:   We followed a user-centered design process consisting of five rounds of semi-structured interviews and usability surveys with topics such as informational/decisional needs of users and requirements for PDAs. Our user-base consisted of 8 urologists, 4 radiation oncologists, 2 oncology nurses, 8 general practitioners, 19 former prostate cancer patients, 4 usability experts and 11 healthy volunteers.  Results:   Informational needs for patients centered on three key factors: treatment experience, post-treatment quality of life, and the impact of side effects. Patients and clinicians valued a PDA that presents balanced information on these factors through simple understandable language and visual aids. Usability questionnaires revealed that patients were more satisfied overall with the PDA than clinicians; however, both groups had concerns that the PDA might lengthen consultation times (42 and 41%, respectively). The PDA is accessible on http://beslissamen.nl/ .  Conclusions:   User-centered design provided valuable insights into PDA requirements but challenges in integrating diverse perspectives as clinicians focus on clinical outcomes while patients also consider quality of life. Nevertheless, it is crucial to involve a broad base of clinical users in order to better understand the decision-making process and to develop a PDA that is accurate, usable, and acceptable.""","""['Anshu Ankolekar', 'Ben G L Vanneste', 'Esther Bloemen-van Gurp', 'Joep G van Roermund', 'Evert J van Limbergen', 'Kees van de Beek', 'Tom Marcelissen', 'Victor Zambon', 'Matthias Oelke', 'Andre Dekker', 'Cheryl Roumen', 'Philippe Lambin', 'Adriana Berlanga', 'Rianne Fijten']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""BMC Med Inform Decis Mak""","""['PROSHADE Protocol: Designing and Evaluating a Decision Aid for Promoting Shared Decision Making in Opportunistic Screening for Prostate Cancer: A Mix-Method Study.', 'Should we involve patients more actively?

To understand the prognostic potential of GATA2 assessment in prostate cancer, we analyzed nuclear GATA2 expression on an annotated tissue microarray with 12,427 prostate cancer samples. Normal prostate glands were negative to weakly positive. GATA2 staining was found in almost all prostate cancers (95%). Strong GATA2 staining was linked to advanced tumor stage, high classical and quantitative Gleason grade (p < 0.0001 each), positive nodal stage (p = 0.0116), and early biochemical recurrence (p < 0.0001). GATA2 was linked to ERG-fusion-type cancers, with strong GATA2 staining in 29% of ERG-negative and 53% of ERG-positive cancers (p < 0.0001). Separate calculations in 3854 cancers with and 4768 cancers without TMPRSS2:ERG fusion revealed that these associations with tumor phenotype and patient outcome were largely driven by the subset of ERG-negative tumors. GATA2 expression was further linked to androgen receptor expression: Only 8% of androgen receptor-negative, but 56% of strongly androgen receptor expressing cancers had strong GATA2 expression (p < 0.0001). In conclusion, the results of our study demonstrate that increasing GATA2 levels are linked to prostate cancer progression and aggressiveness.

This induces exposure misclassification for a substantial fraction of subjects.  Aim:   We used an ensemble of well-established modeling approaches to increase certainty of exposure classification and reevaluated the association with cancers previously linked to TRAP (lung, breast and prostate), other cancers, and all-cause mortality in a cohort of coronary patients.  Methods:   Patients undergoing percutaneous coronary interventions in a major Israeli medical center from 2004 to 2014 (n = 10,627) were followed for cancer (through 2015) and mortality (through 2017) via national registries. Residential exposure to nitrogen oxides (NOx) -a proxy for TRAP- was estimated by optimized dispersion model (ODM) and land use regression (LUR) (rPearson = 0.50). Mutually exclusive groups of subjects classified as exposed by none of the methods (high-certainty low-exposed), ODM alone, LUR alone, or both methods (high-certainty high-exposed) were created. Associations were examined using Cox regression models.  Results:   During follow-up, 741 incident cancer cases were diagnosed and 3051 deaths occurred. Using a ≥25 ppb cutoff, compared with high-certainty low exposed, the multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios (95% confidence intervals) for lung, breast and prostate cancer were 1.56 (1.13-2.15) in high-certainty exposed, 1.27 (0.86-1.86) in LUR-exposed alone, and 1.13 (0.77-1.65) in ODM-exposed alone. The association of the former category was strengthened using more extreme NOx cutoffs. A similar pattern, albeit less strong, was observed for mortality, whereas no association was shown for cancers not previously linked to TRAP.

An important consideration is that the introduction of the replacements should have minimal impact on PSA measurements.  Design and methods:   We report the development of a replacement strategy, informed by field assessment of preparations through an external quality assessment scheme and the subsequent evaluation of the candidate ISs in worldwide collaborative studies.  Results:   By immunoassay, data from participants confirmed the value assigned to the current standards. Robust geometric mean estimates of the free PSA content of the candidate replacement for 96/668 coded 17/102 was 0.533 μg/ampoule (n = 21). The ratio of the content estimates of 17/102:96/668 was 0.516 (GCV 12.5%, n = 21). Robust geometric mean estimates of the total PSA content of the candidate replacement for 96/670, coded 17/100, was 0.505 μg/ampoule (n = 22). The ratio of the content estimates of 17/100:96/670 was 0.490 (GCV 5.3%, n = 22). Through concomitant measurement of a panel of 15 representative patient samples, the candidate ISs were shown to exhibit commutability with patient samples that was comparable with that of the current ISs.

Although many automated segmentation approaches, including those based on deep learning have been proposed, the segmentation performance still has room for improvement due to the large variability in image appearance, imaging interference, and anisotropic spatial resolution. In this paper, we propose the 3D adversarial pyramid anisotropic convolutional deep neural network (3D APA-Net) for prostate segmentation in MR images. This model is composed of a generator (i.e., 3D PA-Net) that performs image segmentation and a discriminator (i.e., a six-layer convolutional neural network) that differentiates between a segmentation result and its corresponding ground truth. The 3D PA-Net has an encoder-decoder architecture, which consists of a 3D ResNet encoder, an anisotropic convolutional decoder, and multi-level pyramid convolutional skip connections. The anisotropic convolutional blocks can exploit the 3D context information of the MR images with anisotropic resolution, the pyramid convolutional blocks address both voxel classification and gland localization issues, and the adversarial training regularizes 3D PA-Net and thus enables it to generate spatially consistent and continuous segmentation results. We evaluated the proposed 3D APA-Net against several state-of-the-art deep learning-based segmentation approaches on two public databases and the hybrid of the two. Our results suggest that the proposed model outperforms the compared approaches on three databases and could be used in a routine clinical workflow.""","""['Haozhe Jia', 'Yong Xia', 'Yang Song', 'Donghao Zhang', 'Heng Huang', 'Yanning Zhang', 'Weidong Cai']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""IEEE Trans Med Imaging""","""['Automatic segmentation of prostate MRI based on 3D pyramid pooling Unet.', 'Deep dense multi-path neural network for prostate segmentation in magnetic resonance imaging.', 'Shape constrained fully convolutional DenseNet with adversarial training for multiorgan segmentation on head and neck CT and low-field MR images.', 'VoxResNet: Deep voxelwise residual networks for brain segmentation from 3D MR images.', 'Investigation and benchmarking of U-Nets on prostate segmentation tasks.', 'Deep learning magnetic resonance imaging predicts platinum sensitivity in patients with epithelial ovarian cancer.', 'A combined deformable model and medical transformer algorithm for medical image segmentation.', 'A review of artificial intelligence in prostate cancer detection on imaging.', 'CAT-Net: A Cross-Slice Attention Transformer Model for Prostate Zonal Segmentation in MRI.', 'Automatic Segmentation of the Prostate on MR Images based on Anatomy and Deep Learning.']"""

However, its value in predicting treatment response in patients with mCRPC is unknown.  Method and materials:   Data of 163 patients with metastatic prostate cancer between 2016 and 2018 were retrospectively analyzed. All patients received androgen deprivation therapy plus bicalutamide after initial diagnosis. After mCRPC, either ABI or docetaxel (DOC) treatment was used. No patient had the experience of therapy to the primary tumor. AKR1C3 protein was detected by immunohistochemical staining from rebiopsy (re-Bx) of primary prostate lesions at mCRPC. Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox regression were used to analyze the association between AKR1C3 and treatment outcomes.  Results:   AKR1C3 was positive in 58 of 163 (35.6%) cases. AKR1C3 was associated with significantly shorter median prostate-specific antigen progression-free survival (mPSA-PFS, 5.6 mo vs 10.7 mo; P < .001), median radiographic progression-free survival (mrPFS, 11.1 mo vs 18.0 mo; P = .018), and numerically shorter median overall survival (mOS, 20.4 mo vs 26.4 mo; P = .157). Notably, AKR1C3-positive patients treated with ABI, but not DOC, had shorter mPSA-PFS and mrPFS compared with AKR1C3-negative men, (mPSA-PFS, 5.7 mo vs. 11.2 mo; P < .001; mrPFS, 12.4 mo vs 23.3 mo; P = .048). However, AKR1C3 expression had no correlation to PSA response or OS.

Evidence is limited; however, the current standard of care is chemotherapy. The benefit of local treatment modalities is unknown.  Methods:   We queried the National Cancer Database identifying all SCC/neuroendocrine cases of the prostate, excluding those with unknown nodal or metastatic status, unknown treatment, or those not receiving chemotherapy. Overall survival (OS) was calculated using Kaplan-Meier curves. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards model was used to identify factors associated with survival. A further subgroup analysis was performed on the utility of local therapy on survival in the nonmetastatic setting.  Results:   Our final cohort included 657 patients with a median age of 68. Most patients had positive lymph nodes (60.1%) and metastatic disease (70.0%). Median survival was 12 months (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 11.1-13.3 months) with a median follow-up of 11.8 months. Metastatic disease, age greater than or equal to 70, omission of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), and lower income (P < .05 for all) were all associated with reduced OS. Patients with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) greater than or equal to 33 ng/mL and those receiving ADT had better survival (P < .05). Those with nonmetastatic disease were more likely to undergo prostatectomy and/or prostatic/pelvic radiation (P < .0001). Prostatic/pelvic radiation in the nonmetastatic setting was associated with longer survival (P = .02). Though well powered, our study is limited by the selection bias inherent to all observational studies, despite the statistical methods utilized to reduce this effect.  Conclusions:   Although chemotherapy is the mainstay of treatment, radiation to the prostate/pelvis may be beneficial in the nonmetastatic setting. In addition to chemotherapy, ADT may benefit patients with an elevated PSA.""","""['April L Metzger', 'Stephen Abel', 'Rodney E Wegner', 'Russell Fuhrer', 'Shifeng Mao', 'Ralph Miller', 'Sushil Beriwal', 'Zachary D Horne']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Improved Survival With Prostate Radiation in Addition to Androgen Deprivation Therapy for Men With Newly Diagnosed Metastatic Prostate Cancer.', 'Contemporary Incidence and Cancer Control Outcomes of Primary Neuroendocrine Prostate Cancer: A SEER Database Analysis.', 'Adjuvant radiation with androgen-deprivation therapy for men with lymph node metastases after radical prostatectomy: identifying men who benefit.', 'Comparative Effectiveness of Local and Systemic Therapy for T4 Prostate Cancer.', 'Small cell carcinoma of the prostate.', ""Targeting Prostate Cancer, the 'Tousled Way'."", 'Real-world experience managing unresectable or metastatic small cell carcinoma of the prostate.', 'Application Effect of Bladder Function Training Combined with Kangaiping Pills on Permanent Bladder Stoma after Radical Prostatectomy.', 'Exploring the Value of BRD9 as a Biomarker, Therapeutic Target and Co-Target in Prostate Cancer.', 'Loss and revival of androgen receptor signaling in advanced prostate cancer.']"""

Materials and methods:   We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 125 patients with prostate cancer treated with luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonists between January 2009 and December 2015. Changes in testosterone concentration during 9 months of ADT with goserelin 11.34 mg, triptorelin 11.25 mg, and leuprolide 11.25 mg were analyzed using a mixed model. The number of patients with serum testosterone below castration levels defined as various values (<50 ng/dL, <20 ng/dL, or <10 ng/dL) at 3, 6, and 9 months were also evaluated.  Results:   Of the 125 patients, 59 received goserelin, 44 received triptorelin, and 22 received leuprolide, respectively. The lowest mean testosterone levels during 9 months of treatment were achieved in patients treated with triptorelin, followed by those treated with leuprolide, and then by those treated with goserelin (p=0.001).

The chelation of Zn2+ or the protonation of a morpholine moiety within these probes results in a partial increase in the fluorescence intensity, an effect ascribed to suppression of one possible photo-induced electron transfer (PET) pathway. In contrast, a large increase in the observed fluorescence intensity is observed at low pH and in the presence of Zn2+; this is rationalized in terms of both possible PET pathways within the probes being blocked. Job plots, fluorescence titration curves, and isothermal titration calorimetry proved consistent with a 1 : 1 Zn2+ complexation stoichiometry. Each probe demonstrated an excellent selectivity towards Zn2+ and the resulting Zn2+ complexes demonstrated pH sensitivity over the 3.5-9 pH range. Fluorescence imaging experiments confirmed that LysoDPP-C4 was capable of imaging lysosomal Zn2+ in live cells. Little evidence of cytotoxicity was seen.

This new profile is part of the implementation of the epidemiological surveillance system within the new Programme of care intervention for health protection in these populations and in the new Regional Prevention Plan.  Design:   geographic population survey providing, for each NPCS considered in this study, a comparison between the local population and the populations of the neighbouring areas.  Setting and participants:   the study population included the residents in the municipalities residing in the NPCSs of Augusta-Priolo, Gela, Milazzo, and Biancavilla.  Main outcome measures:   the standardized mortality ratio (SMR), morbidity (SHR), and tumour incidence (SIR), with the respective 95% confidence intervals, were estimated using the Mortality Registry as source for the mortality index, the database of the hospital discharged as source for the morbidity index, and the data from the Regional Network of Tumour Registers as source for the incidence index.  Results:   in the local comparison, excess of hospitalization in both sexes was reported in Augusta-Priolo for liver cirrhosis, mental disorders, and digestive tract disease, and an excess of incidence and mortality for leukaemia in women and prostate cancer in men. In the NPCS of Gela, there was an excess of hospitalization in both sexes for blood and hematopoietic diseases, circulatory and nervous system diseases, coupled with the same excess of mortality. Excess of incidence and mortality of stomach tumours in men and incidence of lung cancer in women were observed. The area of ​​Milazzo was characterized by an excess of incidence and mortality for melanoma in men. In the municipality of Biancavilla, there is evidence of excess of hospitalization for respiratory diseases and endocrine glands diseases in both sexes, while a mortality excess for circulatory system diseases was highlighted.

However, resistance to abiraterone treatment occurs frequently and the development of new drugs supporting or complementing abiraterone therapy is urgently needed. We recently reported antiproliferative and proapoptotic effects of hydroxylated polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) on various blood cell lines in vitro. Here we report the biological evaluation of the PCB28 derived OH-metabolites 3-OHCB28 or 3'-OHCB28 in prostate cancer cells. Depending on concentration, both metabolites inhibit the growth of PC3 cells, a cell line representing later stages of advanced prostate cancer. In addition 3'-OHCB28 reduced the necessary concentration of abiraterone required for the inhibition of PC3 cells by a factor of 4. Western blot analysis of cytoprotective heatshock proteins (HSP) implicated a significant reduction of HSP27 expression by 3'-OHCB28 in PC3 cells. Given the known HSP27 suppressive role of abiraterone, our results therefore suggest, that that the pharmacological interaction between abiraterone and 3'-OHCB28 in PC3 cells could be produced by the combined effect of both substances on the expression of HSPs, especially the expression of HSP27. Including the known dose response linkages and pharmacokinetic characteristics of the OH-metabolites described here, we conclude, that the use of hydroxylated PCBs can be supportive for the anti-proliferative treatment of prostate cancer and merits further investigation.""","""['Gabriel Daragan', 'Jenny Hoffmann', 'Theresa Vasko', 'Alexander Mustea', 'Martin Burchardt', 'Thomas Kraus', 'Matthias B Stope', 'Patrick Ziegler']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Invest New Drugs""","""['Hedgehog Proteins Consume Steroidal CYP17A1 Antagonists: Potential Therapeutic Significance in Advanced Prostate Cancer.', 'CYP17A1 inhibitor abiraterone, an anti-prostate cancer drug, also inhibits the 21-hydroxylase activity of CYP21A2.', ""Cabozantinib Inhibits Abiraterone's Upregulation of IGFIR Phosphorylation and Enhances Its Anti-Prostate Cancer Activity."", 'CYP17 inhibitors--abiraterone, C17,20-lyase inhibitors and multi-targeting agents.', 'The hunt for a selective 17,20 lyase inhibitor; learning lessons from nature.']"""

Citrus polymethoxyflavonoids (PMFs), such as tangeretin (PMF1), have been found to exhibit various biological activities. Here, we evaluated the inhibitory effects and mechanism of synthetic 5,4'-didemethyltangeretin (PMF2) on human prostate cancer LNCaP cells. We found that PMF2 inhibited the growth of LNCaP cells (GI50 14.6 μM) more strongly than PMF1, and it was less cytotoxic against the normal human prostate RWPE-1 cells. PMF2 upregulated Bad and Bax, downregulated Bcl-2, and activated caspase-3 and PARP in the LNCaP cells, thereby inducing apoptosis. PMF2 also suppressed the anchorage-independent growth of the LNCaP cells. It triggered p21 gene expression by demethylation of the p21 promoter region, and inhibited the protein expressions of DNMT 3B and HDACs 1, 2, and 4/5/9 by epigenetic regulations. We further found that PMF2 showed interactions with DNMTs 1, 2, and 3A ex vivo, which might inhibit DNMT activity. Additionally, PMF2 decreased the anchorage-independent growth of isolated LNCaP cancer stem-like cells (CSLCs) with high CD166 mRNA expression. These results indicated that PMF2 might inhibit the growth of human prostate cancer cells through different mechanisms, suggesting that PMF2 could be an innovative agent for prostate cancer therapy and prevention.""","""['Guor-Jien Wei', 'Yen-Hsiang Chao', 'Yen-Chen Tung', 'Tien-Yuan Wu', 'Zheng-Yuan Su']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""AAPS J""","""['Correction: A Tangeretin Derivative Inhibits the Growth of Human Prostate Cancer LNCaP Cells by Epigenetically Restoring p21 Gene Expression and Inhibiting Cancer Stem-like Cell Proliferation.', 'Epigenetic reactivation of RASSF1A by phenethyl isothiocyanate (PEITC) and promotion of apoptosis in LNCaP cells.', 'Effectiveness of the histone deacetylase inhibitor (S)-2 against LNCaP and PC3 human prostate cancer cells.', 'Differential effects of resveratrol and its naturally occurring methylether analogs on cell cycle and apoptosis in human androgen-responsive LNCaP cancer cells.', 'Apoptotic effects of genistein, biochanin-A and apigenin on LNCaP and PC-3 cells by p21 through transcriptional inhibition of polo-like kinase-1.', 'A naturally occurring mixture of tocotrienols inhibits the growth of human prostate tumor, associated with epigenetic modifications of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors p21 and p27.', 'Chemoprevention of lotus leaf ethanolic extract through epigenetic activation of the NRF2-mediated pathway in murine skin JB6 P+ cell neoplastic transformation.', 'The Molecular Biology of Prostate Cancer Stem Cells: From the Past to the Future.', 'Citrus Flavone Tangeretin Inhibits CRPC Cell Proliferation by Regulating Cx26, AKT, and AR Signaling.', 'Role of Flavonoids as Epigenetic Modulators in Cancer Prevention and Therapy.', 'Remodeling the Epigenetic Landscape of Cancer-Application Potential of Flavonoids in the Prevention and Treatment of Cancer.']"""

Methods:   A total of 429 respondents diagnosed with urologic cancers (prostate cancer, bladder and renal cancer) from Sarawak General Hospital and Subang Jaya Medical Centre in Malaysia were interviewed using a structured questionnaire. Objective and subjective FT were measured by catastrophic health expenditure (healthcare-cost-to-income ratio greater than 40%) and the Personal Financial Well-being Scale, respectively.

As patient health deteriorates, IC assume increasing responsibility, often accompanied by distress. We investigated the quality of life (QOL) of IC of patients referred to a palliative radiotherapy (PRT) program.  Methods:   IC accompanying patients to a dedicated PRT clinic completed a survey based on the validated Caregiver Quality of Life Index-Cancer (CQOLC). Demographics, burden, and engagement in support services were evaluated. Summary statistics were calculated, and parameters were assessed for association with CQOLC scores by a generalized linear model.  Results:   Two hundred one surveys were analyzed representing 197 unique patients. The mean age was 68.3 years, with predominantly lung (25.0%) and prostate (19.3%) malignancies. 24.4% had been in hospital/long-term care within the previous 7 days. IC were 60.8% female, and 60.6% were the patient's spouse. 69.5% lived with the patient and 38.3% were additionally employed. IC spent a daily mean of 6.6 h (SD 7) assisting with instrumental (72.5%) and basic (37.5%) activities of daily living. Mean CQOLC score was 82.1/140 (SD 20). 63.8% of IC had previously accessed support service(s), most commonly home care (37.2%) and pharmacy (29.1%). 55.9% indicated interest in services not yet accessed. Multivariate analysis revealed additional employment, cohabitation, poor patient performance status, and interest in accessing more support services significantly correlated with higher IC burden.

However, blood is a highly complex fluid that contains multiple objects in the same size range as tdEVs (30 nm-1 μm), which obscures an unimpeded analysis of tdEVs. Here, we report a multi-modal analysis platform for the specific capture of tdEVs on antibody-functionalized stainless steel substrates, followed by their analysis using SEM, Raman spectroscopy and AFM, at the single EV level in terms of size and size distribution, and chemical fingerprint. After covalent attachment of anti-EpCAM (epithelial cell adhesion molecule) antibodies on stainless steel substrates, EV samples derived from a prostate cancer cell line (LnCAP) were flushed into a microfluidic device assembled with this stainless steel substrate for capture. To track the captured objects between the different analytical instruments and subsequent correlative analysis, navigation markers were fabricated onto the substrate from a cyanoacrylate glue. Specific capture of tdEVs on the antibody-functionalized surface was demonstrated using SEM, AFM and Raman imaging, with excellent correlation between the data acquired by the individual techniques. The particle distribution was visualized with SEM. Furthermore, a characteristic lipid-protein band at 2850-2950 cm-1 was observed with Raman spectroscopy, and with AFM the size distribution and surface density of the captured EVs was assessed. Finally, correlation of SEM and Raman images enabled discrimination of tdEVs from cyanoacrylate glue particles, highlighting the capability of this multi-modal analysis platform for distinguishing tdEVs from contamination. The trans-instrumental compatibility of the stainless steel substrate and the possibility to spatially correlate the images of the different modalities with the help of the navigation markers open new avenues to a wide spectrum of combinations of different analytical and imaging techniques for the study of more complex EV samples.""","""['Pepijn Beekman', 'Agustin Enciso-Martinez', 'Hoon Suk Rho', 'Sidharam Pundlik Pujari', 'Aufried Lenferink', 'Han Zuilhof', 'Leon W M M Terstappen', 'Cees Otto', 'Séverine Le Gac']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Lab Chip""","""['Synchronized Rayleigh and Raman scattering for the characterization of single optically trapped extracellular vesicles.', 'Detection of extracellular vesicles in plasma and urine of prostate cancer patients by flow cytometry and surface plasmon resonance imaging.', 'SEM-Raman image cytometry of cells.', 'Toward characterizing extracellular vesicles at a single-particle level.', 'Role of tumor‑derived extracellular vesicles in cancer progression and their clinical applications (Review).', 'Extracellular Vesicles as New Players in Drug Delivery: A Focus on Red Blood Cells-Derived EVs.', 'Correlative Raman-Electron-Light (CREL) Microscopy Analysis of Lipid Droplets in Melanoma Cancer Stem Cells.', 'Recent developments in biosensing methods for extracellular vesicle protein characterization.', 'Unveiling the Native Morphology of Extracellular Vesicles from Human Cerebrospinal Fluid by Atomic Force and Cryogenic Electron Microscopy.', 'Advancing microfluidic diagnostic chips into clinical use: a review of current challenges and opportunities.']"""

Because these FTDs may produce fusion-induced neoantigens (FINAs), CDK12 alteration is a candidate biomarker for immune checkpoint inhibitor sensitivity. Here we determine the prevalence of CDK12-LOF alterations and their association with FTDs across diverse tumor types.  Materials and methods:   A total of 142,133 tumor samples comprising 379 cancer types were sequenced (August 2014 to April 2018) by hybrid capture-based comprehensive genomic profiling (Foundation Medicine, Cambridge, MA) as part of routine clinical care. Results were analyzed for base substitutions, short insertions/deletions, rearrangements, and copy number alterations. CDK12-LOF genomic alterations were assessed for zygosity status and association with FTDs/focal copy number gain.  Results: CDK12 genomic alterations were detected in 1.1% of all cases, most frequently in prostate cancer (5.6%), but were also observed at >1% frequency in 11 cancer types. Across multiple cancer types, including prostate, gastric/esophageal, ovarian, breast, and endometrial cancer, the number of FTDs was significantly increased in CDK12-LOF versus CDK12 wild-type cases. Notably, CDK12-LOF was not consistently associated with a homologous recombination deficiency genomic signature. Quantitative assessment of CDK12-associated FTDs by measurement of single copy number gains identified novel likely deleterious CDK12 kinase-domain mutations in prostate and ovarian cancers.  Conclusion:   Detection of CDK12-LOF genomic alterations and their association with FTDs in a diverse spectrum of malignancies suggests that immunotherapy approaches targeting FINAs derived from CDK12-associated FTDs may be a broadly applicable strategy that could be explored across cancer types in a tumor-agnostic manner.  Implications for practice: CDK12 inactivation in ovarian and prostate cancer results in the generation of focal tandem duplications, which can cause fusion-induced neoantigens. In prostate cancer, CDK12 alterations have demonstrated promise as a potential predictive biomarker for response to immune checkpoint blockade. This study evaluated genomic profiling data from >142,000 tumors to determine the prevalence of CDK12 loss-of-function genomic alterations across tumor types and demonstrated that CDK12 alterations are associated with the tandem-duplicator phenotype in cancer types other than ovarian and prostate cancer. The association of CDK12 alterations with focal tandem duplications across broad cancer types suggests that CDK12 inactivation warrants further investigation as a pan-cancer biomarker for immunotherapy benefit.""","""['Ethan S Sokol', 'Dean Pavlick', 'Garrett M Frampton', 'Jeffrey S Ross', 'Vincent A Miller', 'Siraj M Ali', 'Tamara L Lotan', 'Drew M Pardoll', 'Jon H Chung', 'Emmanuel S Antonarakis']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Oncologist""","""['Predicted Immunogenicity of CDK12 Biallelic Loss-of-Function Tumors Varies across Cancer Types.', 'Inactivation of CDK12 Delineates a Distinct Immunogenic Class of Advanced Prostate Cancer.', 'Pan-cancer Analysis of CDK12 Alterations Identifies a Subset of Prostate Cancers with Distinct Genomic and Clinical Characteristics.', 'CDK12: an emerging therapeutic target for cancer.', 'Role and therapeutic potential of CDK12 in human cancers.', 'Characterizing cyclin-dependent kinase 12(CDK12)-altered aggressive prostate cancer: a twelve-case series.', 'The Molecular Landscape of Pancreatobiliary Cancers for Novel Targeted Therapies From Real-World Genomic Profiling.', 'Artificial Intelligence-Assisted Serial Analysis of Clinical Cancer Genomics Data Identifies Changing Treatment Recommendations and Therapeutic Targets.', 'Atezolizumab with enzalutamide versus enzalutamide alone in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer: a randomized phase 3 trial.', 'Analysis of CDK12 alterations in a pan-cancer database.']"""

New predictive markers are needed for optimizing postoperative prostate cancer management. STAT5 is an oncogene in prostate cancer that undergoes amplification in 30% of prostate cancers during progression.  Methods:   We evaluated the significance of a positive status for nuclear STAT5 protein expression versus STAT5 locus amplification versus combined positive status for both in predicting BCR after RP in 300 patients.  Results:   Combined positive STAT5 status was associated with a 45% disadvantage in BCR in Kaplan-Meier survival analysis in all Gleason grade patients. Patients with Gleason grade group (GG) 2 and 3 prostate cancers and combined positive status for STAT5 had a more pronounced disadvantage of 55% to 60% at 7 years after RP in univariate analysis. In multivariate analysis, including the Cancer of the Prostate Risk Assessment Postsurgical nomogram (CAPRA-S) variables, combined positive STAT5 status was independently associated with a shorter BCR-free survival in all Gleason GG patients (HR, 2.34; P = 0.014) and in intermediate Gleason GG 2 or 3 patients (HR, 3.62; P = 0.021).

Methods/ design:   The PAROS trial is a prospective, multicenter and randomized phase III trial for men with localized prostate carcinoma after surgery. Post-prostatectomy patients will be randomized to either normofractionated radiotherapy (nRT) with photons (70.0/ 2.0 Gy), or hypofractionated radiotherapy (hRT) with photons (57.0/ 3.0 Gy) or hRT with protons (57.0/ 3.0 Gy relative biological effectiveness [RBE]). Block randomization is stratified by Gleason Score (≤ 7 vs. > 7) and treatment indication (adjuvant vs. salvage). The trial is planned to enroll 897 patients. The primary objective is to show an improvement in the bowel-score according to EORTC QLQ-PR25 after proton therapy compared to photon irradiation (week 12 vs. baseline). Secondary aims are non-inferiority of hRT compared to nRT with regard to biochemical progression-free survival (bPFS), overall survival (OS), quality of life and toxicity.  Discussion:   The present study aims to evaluate the role of hypofractionated radiotherapy to the prostate bed with photons and protons leading to significant impact on future management of operated men with prostate cancer.

However, limited drug loading (DL) and insufficient drug release at the tumor site remain the main obstacles in developing macrophage-based delivery systems. In this study, we constructed a biomimetic delivery system (BDS) by loading doxorubicin (DOX)-loaded reduced graphene oxide (rGO) into a mouse macrophage-like cell line (RAW264.7), hoping that the newly constructed BDS could perfectly combine the tumor-tropic ability of macrophages and the photothermal property of rGO.  Results:   At the same DOX concentration, the macrophages could absorb more DOX/PEG-BPEI-rGO than free DOX. The tumor-tropic capacity of RAW264.7 cells towards RM-1 mouse prostate cancer cells did not undergo significant change after drug loading in vitro and in vivo. PEG-BPEI-rGO encapsulated in the macrophages could effectively convert the absorbed near-infrared light into heat energy, causing rapid release of DOX. The BDS showed excellent anti-tumor efficacy in vivo.  Conclusions:   The BDS that we developed in this study had the following characteristic features: active targeting of tumor cells, stimuli-release triggered by near-infrared laser (NIR), and effective combination of chemotherapy and photothermotherapy. Using the photothermal effect produced by PEG-BPEI-rGO and DOX released from the macrophages upon NIR irradiation, MAs-DOX/PEG-BPEI-rGO exhibited a significant inhibitory effect on tumor growth.""","""['Lei Qiang', 'Zheng Cai', 'Wenjun Jiang', 'Jiyong Liu', 'Zongguang Tai', 'Guorui Li', 'Chunai Gong', 'Shen Gao', 'Yuan Gao']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""J Nanobiotechnology""","""['Photothermally triggered cytosolic drug delivery via endosome disruption using a functionalized reduced graphene oxide.', 'Macrophage mediated biomimetic delivery system for the treatment of lung metastasis of breast cancer.', 'Near-infrared light remote-controlled intracellular anti-cancer drug delivery using thermo/pH sensitive nanovehicle.', 'Functionalized Reduced Graphene Oxide as a Versatile Tool for Cancer Therapy.', 'Graphene-based nanomaterials and their potentials in advanced drug delivery and cancer therapy.', 'Nanomedicine in cancer therapy.', 'Dual identity of tumor-associated macrophage in regulated cell death and oncotherapy.', 'Biomimetic liposomal nanozymes improve breast cancer chemotherapy with enhanced penetration and alleviated hypoxia.', 'Macrophage cell membrane-based nanoparticles: a new promising biomimetic platform for targeted delivery and treatment.', 'Engineering Macrophages via Nanotechnology and Genetic Manipulation for Cancer Therapy.']"""

Materials and methods:   Localized prostate cancer patients who received PORT after radical prostatectomy between 2001 and 2012 were identified retrospectively in a multi-institutional database. In total, 1,117 patients in 19 institutions were included. Biochemical failure after PORT was defined as prostate-specific antigen (PSA) ≥ nadir+2 after PORT or initiation of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) for increasing PSA regardless of its value.  Results:   Ten-year biochemical failure-free survival, clinical failure-free survival, distant metastasisfree survival, overall survival (OS), and cause-specific survival were 60.5%, 76.2%, 84.4%, 91.1%, and 96.6%, respectively, at a median of 84 months after PORT.

EMPD of the scrotum is rare. Twenty patients were identified from the pathology files of 4 institutions between 2000 and 2018. Patients were 63- to 87-year-old (mean: 73 y) with a history of symptoms of between 4 months and 10 years. Two patients had a history of prostate cancer. Follow-up was available in 11 patients for a median of 71 months (range: 8 to 126 mo). Nine of 11 patients (82%) had positive margins, and 73% required reexcisions. Three patients had a focal dermal invasion, 1 of whom reportedly died of another etiology 25 months post diagnosis and 2 were disease-free at 24 and 68 months. No patient had inguinal lymphadenopathy. Two patients were alive with disease. Immunohistochemically, GATA3 and GCDFP15 were expressed in 6/6 cases, CK7 in 8/8 cases, and androgen receptor in 13/13 cases. HER2 was positive in 5/12 cases. PSA was positive in 1 patient who had a history of prostate cancer, whereas other prostate markers (NKX3.1 and prostein) were negative, and CK7 and GCDFP15 were positive, rendering primary EMPD diagnosis. Twelve other cases were negative for PSA and NKX3.1. In conclusion, EMPD of the scrotum has an insidious onset and its nonspecific symptoms can be misdiagnosed as dermatitis or fungal infection. Although localized EMPD has a favorable prognosis, the invasive disease is rare and did not predict metastasis or progression. Margins are frequently positive requiring reexcision. Occasionally, cases can be positive for PSA leading to diagnostic pitfalls.""","""['Maryam Shabihkhani', 'Pallavi Patil', 'Belkiss Murati Amador', 'Jose A Plaza', 'Adeboye O Osunkoya', 'Kara A Lombardo', 'Jonathan I Epstein', 'Andres Matoso']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Appl Immunohistochem Mol Morphol""","""['The role of immunohistochemistry in discriminating primary from secondary extramammary Paget disease.', ""Clinical and pathological characteristics of extramammary Paget's disease: report of 246 Chinese male patients."", 'Primary invasive extramammary Paget disease on penoscrotum: a clinicopathological analysis of 41 cases.', 'Extramammary Paget disease.', ""Extramammary Paget's Disease: Diagnosis, Pathogenesis, and Treatment with Focus on Recent Developments."", 'Poorly differentiated cutaneous apocrine carcinomas: histopathological clues and immunohistochemical analysis for the diagnosis of this unusual neoplasm.', 'CK 8∕18: the key to differentiating intracutaneous lesions with pagetoid features.', 'Poorly Differentiated Scrotal Carcinoma With Apocrine Immunophenotype.', ""Extramammary Paget's Disease of the Vulva: Report of Two Cases.""]"""

Materials and methods:   A total of 493,282 participants in the National Longitudinal Mortality Study who provided detailed tobacco information from 1993 to 2005 were included in study. Our primary outcome was death from bladder, kidney or prostate cancer. Cause of death was determined from death certificates. Analyzed smoking parameters included smoking status at the time of the survey, age at the start of smoking and home smoking rules. Multivariable Cox regression models were used to assess associations of different smoking parameters with bladder, kidney and prostate cancer specific mortality.  Results:   During a 5-year followup 5.6% of participants who had ever smoked died compared to 3.1% of those who had never smoked (p <0.0001). Of those who died of bladder, kidney and prostate cancer 62%, 58% and 62%, respectively, were ever smokers. On multivariable analysis ever smoking was associated with bladder and kidney cancer mortality (HR 1.92, 95% CI 1.25-2.97, and HR 1.54, 95% CI 1.01-2.34, respectively).

The extensive use of multiple biomarkers plays an important role in the diagnosis and prognosis of PC. However, the accuracy of biomarkers for PC prognosis needs to be urgently improved. This study aimed to identify a novel prognostic biomarker for PC.  Materials and methods:   Differentially methylated CpG sites were identified from the GSE76938 dataset ( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/ ) using R software version 3.1.4. Four significant CpG sites on the SLCO4C1 gene were found to be closely associated with prognosis in PC. Data downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) were used for validation. Co-expression and functional enrichment analyses were used to explore the roles of SLCO4C1 in molecular functions, biological processes and cellular components. Total RNA extraction and qRT-PCR were used to reveal the difference in SLCO4C1 expression between tumour and normal tissues. Bisulfite amplicon sequencing (BSAS) was used to identify methylation levels at the CpG sites.  Results:   In the GSE76938 cohort, 10,206 CpG sites were identified to be differentially methylated in tumour versus normal prostate tissues. Among the CpG sites, four sites (cg06480736, cg19774478, cg19788741 and cg22149516) located in the promotor region (TSS200-1500) of SLCO4C1 were found to be significantly hypermethylated in tumour tissues. The results were validated in an independent dataset (TCGA PRAD cohort). In the cohort from TCGA, SLCO4C1 expression was negatively correlated with methylation levels at the four sites. The results of qRT-PCR validated that tumour tissues had a relatively lower expression of SLCO4C1. Bisulfite amplicon sequencing (BSAS) further confirmed a higher methylation level at the SLCO4C1 promoter in tumour tissues. SLCO4C1 (cg06480736, cg19774478, cg19788741 and cg22149516) was identified as a significant promising biomarker for biochemical recurrence-free survival in Kaplan-Meier analysis (P < 0.01) and univariate Cox proportional hazards analysis: cg06480736 (HR 15.914, P < 0.001), cg19774478 (HR 9.001, P < 0.001), cg19788741 (HR 10.759, P = 0.003) and cg22149516 (HR 17.144, P = 0.006).

However, the incidence of secondary tumors increases every year after the diagnosis of chronic lymphotcytic leukemia. One of the induced secondary tumors is prostate cancer. For high-risk prostate cancer in particular, the standard therapy is radical prostatectomy and extended lymphadenectomy, which carries high risks of lymphatic leakage and reduced quality of life. Currently, there has been no study reporting the necessity of extended lymphadenectomy for high-risk prostate cancer in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia.  Case presentation:   We reported two cases with concomitant high-risk prostate cancer and chronic lymphocytic leukemia. The first patient was a 60-year-old male diagnosed with synchronous prostate cancer and chronic lymphocytic leukemia. The second patient was a 70-year-old male initially presented with chronic lymphocytic leukemia alone but was then diagnosed with high-risk prostate cancer nine years later. Both patients received neoadjuvant androgen deprivation therapy and robot-assisted radical prostatectomy. The first patient underwent extended lymphadenectomy and developed prolonged postoperative lymphatic cyst. Histology showed chronic lymphocytic leukemia infiltration in resected lymph nodes. Serum prostate-specific antigen levels at one and 13 months post-operation were both 0.01 ng/ml. The second patient received positron emission tomography/computed tomography before androgen deprivation therapy, which showed mild fluorodeoxyglucose-avidity in lymph nodes across the entire body. Lymph node biopsy showed only chronic lymphocytic leukemia. The patient experienced no postoperative complication. Serum prostate-specific antigen levels at one and nine months post-operation were both 0.02 ng/ml.  Conclusions:   Extended lymphadenectomy may not be necessary for patients with concomitant high-risk prostate cancer and chronic lymphocytic leukemia, but such patients must undergo thorough preoperative assessment and mindful postoperative follow-up. Positron emission tomography/computed tomography may be valuable in detecting nodal metastases. A lymph node biopsy is necessary for patients with an ambiguous positron emission tomography/computed tomography in the metastatic involvement of lymph node.""","""['Yinjie Zhu', 'Yanqing Wang', 'Zhiyu Qian', 'Jiahua Pan', 'Qiang Liu', 'Baijun Dong', 'Wei Xue']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""BMC Cancer""","""['Extended pelvic lymphadenectomy in patients undergoing radical prostatectomy: high incidence of lymph node metastasis.', 'Robot-assisted Salvage Lymph Node Dissection for Clinically Recurrent Prostate Cancer.', 'Targeted salvage lymphadenectomy in patients treated with radical prostatectomy with biochemical recurrence: complete biochemical response without adjuvant therapy in patients with low volume lymph node recurrence over a long-term follow-up.', 'Management of positive lymph nodes following radical prostatectomy.', 'Role of robot-assisted radical prostatectomy in locally advanced prostate cancer.']"""

Methods:   From July 2016 to August 2017, 245 patients who were performed TTPB in Clinical Medical College of Yangzhou University were recruited. The patients were randomized into three groups using a random number table. Group-1 received prostate capsule local anesthesia with 22 ml of 1% lidocaine. Group-2 additionally received PNB on the basis of Group-1. To perform PNB, 5 ml 1% lidocaine was injected into the region of prostatic neurovascular bundle situated in the angle of prostate-bladder-seminal vesicle. Group-3 received prostate capsule local anesthesia plus PPB (5 ml of 1% lidocaine injection into the pelvic plexus which located on lateral to the bilateral seminal vesicle apex). The patients' pain and satisfaction were evaluated by visual analogue scale and visual numerical scale, respectively.  Results:   The age, total prostate volume, PSA and the number of cores were comparable among the three groups.

In cancer systems biology, biological networks are typically modeled through Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) models. Hence, robustness analysis consists in quantifying how much the temporal behavior of a specific node is influenced by the perturbation of model parameters. The Conditional Robustness Algorithm (CRA) is a valuable methodology to perform robustness analysis on a selected output variable, representative of the proliferation activity of cancer disease.  Results:   Here we introduce our new freely downloadable software, the CRA Toolbox. The CRA Toolbox is an Object-Oriented MATLAB package which implements the features of CRA for ODE models. It offers the users the ability to import a mathematical model in Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML), to perturb the model parameter space and to choose the reference node for the robustness analysis. The CRA Toolbox allows the users to visualize and save all the generated results through a user-friendly Graphical User Interface (GUI). The CRA Toolbox has a modular and flexible architecture since it is designed according to some engineering design patterns. This tool has been successfully applied in three nonlinear ODE models: the Prostate-specific Pten-/- mouse model, the Pulse Generator Network and the EGFR-IGF1R pathway.  Conclusions:   The CRA Toolbox for MATLAB is an open-source tool implementing the CRA to perform conditional robustness analysis. With its unique set of functions, the CRA Toolbox is a remarkable software for the topological study of biological networks.

An imbalance through a network of nervous, endocrine, and immune systems initiate a signal of altered growth from the brain to the prostate gland, leading to adverse effects such as inflammation.  Objective:   The aim of this study was to evaluate the gene expression of dopamine receptor family, COMT, and IL6 to identify novel correlations in BPH and PCa in both blood and tumor of the patients.  Methods:   Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from BPH (n= 30) and PCa (n= 30) patients, and prostate tumor tissues (n= 14) along with pathologically normal adjacent tissues (n= 14) were isolated, mRNA was extracted, and cDNA was synthesized, respectively. Quantitative real- time PCR was applied for DRD1- DRD5, COMT, and IL6 genes in all samples.  Results:   We found, for the first time, that the expression of COMT and IL6 genes were inversely correlated with the expression of DRD1 and DRD2 genes through the extent of differentiation of PCa from BPH condition. In addition, the PSA levels were correlated with the expression of DRD1 in BPH cases and DRD1, DRD4, DRD5, and IL6 in PCa cases.

The identification of biomarkers for diagnosis and prognosis is an urgent clinical issue for PCa. Here, we developed a novel scoring strategy, including cluster score (CS) and predicting score (PS), to identify 29 PCa genes (called PCa29) for early diagnostic biomarkers from two datasets in Gene Expression Omnibus. The result indicates that PCa29 can discriminate between normal and tumor tissues and are specific for prostate cancer. To validate PCa29, we found that 97% of PCa29 were consistently significant with these gene expressions in The Cancer Genome Atlas; furthermore, ∼ 70% of PCa29 are consensus to the protein expression in The Human Protein Atlas. Finally, we examined 10 genes in PCa29 on three PCa cell lines by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction.

Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were constructed for risk factor models +/- bone markers. Significant variables were allowed to compete in a classification and regression tree (CART) analysis. Hazard ratios(HR) were calculated by comparing OS in each of the terminal nodes to a reference group in a Cox model.  Results:   750 patients were included. Each bone marker significantly contributed to the risk factor-adjusted OS Cox model, with higher levels associated with worse OS. BAP (HR = 1.15, p = 0.008), CICP (HR = 1.27, p < 0.001), and PYD (HR = 1.21, p = 0.047) in combination were significantly associated with OS.

The eligible studies were phase II and III RCT of olaparib. Safety profile from each selected study was evaluated for all-grade and high-grade fatigue and anemia adverse events. Summary incidences and the RR, with 95% confidence intervals, of all-grade and high-grade events were calculated using random-effects or fixed-effects model based on the heterogeneity of selected studies.  Results:   A total of 9 trials were selected, and included 2074 patients with advanced ovarian, gastric, prostate, lung or breast cancer. 908 patients received placebo/control treatments and 1166 received olaparib alone or combination with other active cancer treatments. The RR of all-grade and high fatigue was 1.24 (95% CI, 1.10-1.39) and 1.71 (95% CI, 1.06-2.77), respectively. The RR of all-grade and high-grade anemia was 2.10 (95% CI, 1.48-2.98) and 3.15 (95% CI, 1.73-5.71), respectively.  Conclusion:   Our findings suggest that the olaparib treatment is associated with an increased risk of fatigue and anemia. Since fatigue and anemia are very common treatment related adverse events, and both can impair the quality of life of patients, it is important to identify them early and manage it accordingly in order to optimize the overall treatment.""","""['Viviane C Ruiz-Schutz', 'Larissa M Gomes', 'Rodrigo C Mariano', 'Daniel V P de Almeida', 'Juliana M Pimenta', 'Graziela Z Dal Molin', 'Fabio R Kater', 'Rosely Yamamura', 'Nelson F Correa Neto', 'Fernando C Maluf', 'Fabio A Schutz']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Crit Rev Oncol Hematol""","""['Risk of Fatigue and Anemia in Patients With Prostate Cancer Treated With Novel Oral Anti-androgens: A Meta-Analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials.', 'Specific Toxicity of Maintenance Olaparib Versus Placebo in Advanced Malignancies: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.', 'Risk of anemia attributable to everolimus in patients with cancer: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.', 'Risk of severe hematologic toxicities in cancer patients treated with PARP inhibitors: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.', 'Overall survival in patients with platinum-sensitive recurrent serous ovarian cancer receiving olaparib maintenance monotherapy: an updated analysis from a randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind, phase 2 trial.', 'Factors for the development of anemia in patients with newly introduced olaparib: A retrospective case-control study.', 'Molecular and biochemical investigations of the anti-fatigue effects of tea polyphenols and fruit extracts of Lycium ruthenicum Murr. on mice with exercise-induced fatigue.', 'Exposure-Response Analyses of Olaparib in Real-Life Patients with Ovarian Cancer.', 'PARP inhibitor-related haemorrhages: What does the real-world study say?', 'Efficacy and safety of Gemogenovatucel-T (Vigil) immunotherapy for advanced ovarian carcinoma: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.']"""

The prostate pedicle (PP), medial side of the PP (MPP), Denonvilliers' fascia (DF), and typical NVB were stimulated using bipolar electrodes. The changes in pressure at the middle of the urethra were measured using an inserted balloon-catheter to detect the increase in cavernosal pressure.  Results:   Although the study included only 12 patients, each stimulation of the PP, MPP, and NVB induced evident urethral pressure responses in all patients. The median amplitude of the pressure responses was 5.49 (IQR 3.11-8.42), 6.00 (IQR 3.70-8.30), and 3.22 (IQR 2.48-7.19) cm H2O at the PP, MPP, and NVB, respectively. The amplitude of responses at the PP and MPP was not small compared with the responses at the typical NVB. Stimulations at the DF induced unstable weak urethral response alone or no response in all patients.  Conclusion:   We showed that electrostimulation of the PP and MPP increases the cavernosal pressure similar to the typical NVB stimulation.

However, adverse effects of chemotherapeutics enforce premature treatment cessation, which leads to the tumor recurrence and accelerated death of oncologic patients. Recently, sodium ascorbate (ASC) has been suggested as a promising drug for the adjunctive chemotherapy of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) and prostate cancer (PC). To estimate whether ASC can interfere with tumor recurrence between the first and second-line chemotherapy, we analyzed the effect of high ASC doses on the expansion of cells in vitro and in vivo.  Main methods:   Brightfield microscopy-assisted approaches were used to estimate the effect of ASC (1-14 mM) on the morphology and invasiveness of human GBM, rat PC and normal mouse 3T3 cells, whereas cytostatic/pro-apoptotic activity of ASC was estimated with flow cytometry. These assays were complemented by the in vitro CellROX-assisted analyses of intracellular oxidative stress and in vivo estimation of GBM tumor invasion.  Key findings:   ASC considerably decreased the proliferation and motility of GBM and PC cells. This effect was accompanied by intracellular ROS over-production and necrotic death of tumor cells, apparently resulting from their ""autoschizis"". In vivo studies demonstrated the retardation of GBM tumor growth and invasion in the rats undergone intravenous ASC administration, in the absence of detectable systemic adverse effects of ASC.  Significance:   Our data support previous notions on anti-tumor activity of high ASC doses. However, autoschizis-related cell responses to ASC indicate that its application in human adjunctive tumor therapy should be considered with caution.""","""['Damian Ryszawy', 'Maciej Pudełek', 'Jessica Catapano', 'Małgorzata Ciarach', 'Zuzanna Setkowicz', 'Ewa Konduracka', 'Zbigniew Madeja', 'Jarosław Czyż']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Life Sci""","""['Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF) Augments the Invasive Potential of Human Glioblastoma Multiforme Cells via the Activation of Collaborative EGFR/ROS-Dependent Signaling.', 'Cytotoxic effects of high concentrations of sodium ascorbate on human myeloid cell lines.', 'Tumor microenvironment tenascin-C promotes glioblastoma invasion and negatively regulates tumor proliferation.', 'Endocannabinoids are potential inhibitors of glioblastoma multiforme proliferation.', 'Overview of Transforming Growth Factor β Superfamily Involvement in Glioblastoma Initiation and Progression.', 'Targeting Glioblastoma via Selective Alteration of Mitochondrial Redox State.', 'Deciphering the Functional Role of RIPK4 in Melanoma.', 'A RCT Testing If a Storybook Can Teach Children About Home Safety.', 'Vitamin C Transporters and Their Implications in Carcinogenesis.', 'Bioinspired Bola-Type Peptide Dendrimers Inhibit Proliferation and Invasiveness of Glioblastoma Cells in a Manner Dependent on Their Structure and Amphipathic Properties.']"""

Current diagnosis techniques, such as prostate-specific antigen tests, transrectal ultrasound scans, and biopsies, are often inconclusive, and in the latter case, invasive. Here, we explore the use of clofazimine hydrochloride nanoparticles (CFZ-HCl NPs), a repurposed formulation from an FDA-approved antimycobacterial agent, as a photoacoustic contrast agent for the evaluation of prostate cancer due to its macrophage-targeting capabilities and high optical absorbance at 495 nm. Using a transgenic adenocarcinoma of the mouse prostate (TRAMP) mouse model, our results indicate a preferential accumulation of intravenously injected CFZ-HCl NPs in cancerous prostates over normal prostates. Differences in accumulation of CFZ-HCl NPs between cancerous and normal prostates were determined using a two-wavelength unmixing technique via ex vivo photoacoustic imaging. Thus, intravenous injection of CFZ-HCl NPs leads to differences in the interactions of the particles with cancerous vs normal prostates, while allowing for photoacoustic detection and analysis of prostate cancer.

We used population-based data to examine trends in postdiagnosis depression incidence among racial/ethnic and sexual groups.  Methods:   We identified 123,066 patients diagnosed with late-stage breast, prostate, lung, or colorectal cancer from 2001 to 2013 in the Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results Medicare-linked database. The primary outcome was the incidence of postdiagnosis depression after a late-stage cancer diagnosis. Trend analysis was performed using the Cochran-Armitage test. Stratified incidence rates were calculated for the racial/ethnic and sexual groups.  Results:   The incidence of depression after cancer diagnosis increased from 15.3% in 2001 to 24.1% in 2013, P trend<0.0001. About 50% of depression was reported in the first 3 months of stage IV cancer diagnosis. A total of 19,775 (20.0%) non-Hispanic whites, 1937 (15.9%) non-Hispanic blacks, and 657 (12.7%) Hispanics were diagnosed with depression during a mean follow-up of 2.7 months (interquartile range: 0.9 to 10.2 mo). The incidence of depression is significantly higher among females than males, 22.7% versus 16.3%, P<0.0001.

In human CaP, gene fusion between androgen responsive regulatory elements at the 5'-untranslated region of TMPRSS2 and ETS-related genes (ERG) is present in at least 50% of prostate tumors. Here we have investigated the unique cellular transcriptome associated with over-expression of ERG in ERG-inducible LNCaP cell model system of human CaP. Comprehensive transcriptome analyses reveal a distinct signature that distinguishes ERG dependent and independent CaP in LNCaP cells. Our data highlight a significant heterogeneity among the transcripts. Out of the 526 statistically significant differentially expressed genes, 232 genes are up-regulated and 294 genes are down-regulated in response to ERG. These ERG-associated genes are linked to several major cellular pathways, cell cycle regulation being the most significant. Consistently our data indicate that ERG plays a key role in modulating the expression of genes required for G1 to S phase transition, particularly those that affect cell cycle arrest at G1 phase. Moreover, cell cycle arrest in response to ERG appears to be promoted by induction of p21 in a p53 independent manner. These findings may provide new insights into mechanisms that promote growth and progression of CaP.""","""['Parameet Kumar', 'Joyeeta Chakraborty', 'Gauthaman Sukumar', 'Clifton Dalgard', 'Raghunath Chatterjee', 'Roopa Biswas']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Oncotarget""","""['TMPRSS2:ERG fusion by translocation or interstitial deletion is highly relevant in androgen-dependent prostate cancer, but is bypassed in late-stage androgen receptor-negative prostate cancer.', 'Significance of the TMPRSS2:ERG gene fusion in prostate cancer.', 'Relation of ETS transcription factor family member ERG, androgen receptor and topoisomerase 2β expression to TMPRSS2-ERG fusion status in prostate cancer.', 'TMPRSS2/ERG fusion gene expression alters chemo- and radio-responsiveness in cell culture models of androgen independent prostate cancer.', 'TMPRSS2 fusions with oncogenic ETS factors in prostate cancer involve unbalanced genomic rearrangements and are associated with HDAC1 and epigenetic reprogramming.', 'Towards Understanding the Key Signature Pathways Associated from Differentially Expressed Gene Analysis in an Indian Prostate Cancer Cohort.', 'Transcriptomic Profiling and Pathway Analysis of Mesenchymal Stem Cells Following Low Dose-Rate Radiation Exposure.', 'Transcriptomic profiling and pathway analysis of cultured human lung microvascular endothelial cells following ionizing radiation exposure.', 'SFPQ rescues F508del-CFTR expression and function in cystic fibrosis bronchial epithelial cells.', 'Precision Nutrition and Cancer Relapse Prevention: A Systematic Literature Review.']"""

In healthy cells that express AGR2, the predominant form is iAGR2, which resides in the endoplasmic reticulum. In contrast, cancer cells secrete and express eAGR2 on the cell surface. We wanted to test if AGR2 is a cancer-specific tumor-associated antigen. We utilized two AGR2 antibodies, P3A5 and P1G4, for in vivo tumor localization and tumor growth inhibition. The monoclonal antibodies recognized both human AGR2 and mouse Agr2. Biodistribution experiments using a syngeneic mouse model showed high uptake of P3A5 AGR2 antibody in xenografted eAgr2+ pancreatic tumors, with limited uptake in normal tissues. In implanted human patient-derived eAGR2+ pancreatic cancer xenografts, tumor growth inhibition was evaluated with antibodies and Gemcitabine (Gem). Inhibition was more potent by P1G4 + Gem combination than Gem alone or P3A5 + Gem. We converted these two antibodies to human:mouse chimeric forms: the constructed P3A5 and P1G4 chimeric mVLhCκ and mVHhCγ (γ1, γ2, γ4) genes were inserted in a single mammalian expression plasmid vector, and transfected into human 293F cells. Expressed human:mouse chimeric IgG1, IgG2 and IgG4 antibodies retained AGR2 binding. Increase in IgG yield by transfected cells could be obtained with serial transfection of vectors with different drug resistance.

Patients and methods:   A total of 45,426 men from 1152 hospitals with pT2 prostate cancer and known margin status after radical prostatectomy were identified using the National Cancer Database (2010-2015). Data on patient, cancer, hospital factors, and surgical approach were extracted. A mixed effects logistic regression model was computed to examine factors associated with PSM and partial R2 values to assess the relative contributions of patient, cancer, and hospital variables to PSM status.  Results:   Median PSM rate of 8.5% (interquartile range, 5.2%-13.0%).

Patients and methods:   We retrospectively reviewed data from 2 institutions for AA men who underwent RP between 2010 and 2015. Household incomes were estimated using census tract data, and patients were stratified into income groups relative to the study population median. Pathologic outcomes after RP were assessed, including the postsurgical Cancer of the Prostate Risk Assessment (CAPRA-S) score and a definition of adverse pathology (stage ≥ pT3, Gleason score ≥ 4+3, or positive lymph nodes), and compared between income groups.  Results:   We analyzed data of 347 AA men. Median household income was $37,954. Low-SES men had significantly higher prostate-specific antigen values (mean 10.2 vs. 7.3; P < .01) and CAPRA-S scores (mean 3.4 vs. 2.5; P < .01), more advanced pathologic stage (T3-T4 31.8% vs. 21.5%; P = .03), and higher rates of seminal vesicle invasion (17.3% vs. 8.2%; P < .01), positive surgical margins (35.3% vs. 22.1%; P < .01), and adverse pathology (41.4% vs. 30.1%; P = .03). Linear and logistic regression showed significant inverse associations of SES with CAPRA-S score (P < .01) and adverse pathology (P = .03).  Conclusion:   In a population of AA men who underwent RP, we observed an independent association of low SES with advanced stage or aggressive prostate cancer. By including only patients in a single racial demographic group, we eliminated the potential confounding effect of race on the association between SES and prostate cancer risk. These findings suggest that impoverished populations might benefit from more intensive screening and early, aggressive treatment of prostatic malignancies.""","""['Samuel A Weprin', 'Daniel C Parker', 'Joshua D Jones', 'Joshua R Kaplan', 'Laura L Giusto', 'Jack H Mydlo', 'Sue-Jean S Yu', 'David I Lee', 'Daniel D Eun', 'Adam C Reese']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Clin Genitourin Cancer""","""['African American men with low-grade prostate cancer have increased disease recurrence after prostatectomy compared with Caucasian men.', 'African American men with very low-risk prostate cancer exhibit adverse oncologic outcomes after radical prostatectomy: should active surveillance still be an option for them?', 'Racial disparities in oncologic outcomes after radical prostatectomy: long-term follow-up.', 'Is active surveillance a suitable option for African American men with prostate cancer?

Methods:   Three hundred thirty-five consecutive patients who underwent primary TJA using epidural anesthesia were retrospectively reviewed. The initial 103 patients received a preoperative urinary catheter, which was maintained until the morning of postoperative day 1. The subsequent 232 patients did not receive a preoperative urinary catheter. Demographics, medical complications, GU complications, and length of stay were compared between groups.  Results:   Compared between catheter and noncatheter groups, there were no differences in demographics including age, gender, or laterality of surgery. There was a difference in type of surgery (total knee arthroplasty vs total hip arthroplasty) (P = .008). There was no difference in American Society of Anesthesiologists score, but with a difference in body mass index (P = .01). There were no differences in GU complications among patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia or prostate cancer. However, among patients with a history of prostate disorders (benign prostatic hyperplasia or prostate cancer), urinary tract infection rate was higher in catheter group (P = .023). Postoperative GU complications were associated with increased median age in years and increased average length of stay in days.  Conclusion:   Patients undergoing TJA under epidural anesthesia demonstrate no increased risk of postoperative urological complications without the placement of preoperative indwelling urinary catheter.

Prostatic magnetic resonance imaging showed high sensitivity in the detection of clinically significant neoplasia and agreement with the Gleason score. Therefore, we attempted to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of the prostate imaging reporting and data system, using biopsy and prostatectomy as the reference standard. The secondary goal of correlating prostatic magnetic resonance imaging findings and anatomopathological samples is obtained.  Materials and methods:   We retrospectively analyzed seventy-nine 1.5 Tesla prostatic magnetic resonance imaging scans in patients aged 31 to 86 years, performed at the Clinical Hospital of the Federal University of Paraná between January 2015 and February 2018.  Results:   Considering all 79 patients, prostatic magnetic resonance imaging was able to diagnose tumor in 47 patients (59.4%). Considering the peripheral zone, the prostatic magnetic resonance imaging had a sensitivity of 75.0% (95% confidence interval: 52.1%-98.0%), specificity of 89.5% (95% confidence interval: 66.0%-100%), 94.4% positive predictive value (95% confidence interval: 71.0%-100%), 66.7% negative predictive value (95% confidence interval: 43.0%-69.0%), 83.8% Positive Likelihood Ratio (PVR) (95% confidence interval: 60.0%-100%), 27.9% Negative Likelihood Ratio (RVN) (95% confidence interval: 5.0%-50.0 %), and accuracy of 86.3% (95% confidence interval: 63.0%-100%). The receiver operating characteristic curve obtained demonstrated the sensitivity variation according to the prostate imaging reporting and data system score of the patients, obtaining an area under the curve of 84.8 for a prostate imaging reporting and data system cutoff of 3.

Materials and methods:   We developed a personalized region-based convolutional neural network to localize the prostate treatment target without implanted fiducials. To train the deep neural network (DNN), we used the patient's planning computed tomography (pCT) images with pre-delineated prostate target to generate a large amount of synthetic kV projection X-ray images in the geometry of onboard imager (OBI) system. The DNN model was evaluated by retrospectively studying 10 patients who underwent prostate IGRT. Three out of the ten patients who had implanted fiducials and the fiducials' positions in the OBI images acquired for treatment setup were examined to show the potential of the proposed method for prostate IGRT. Statistical analysis using Lin's concordance correlation coefficient was calculated to assess the results along with the difference between the digitally reconstructed radiographs (DRR) derived and DNN predicted locations of the prostate.  Results:   Differences between the predicted target positions using DNN and their actual positions are (mean ± standard deviation) 1.58 ± 0.43 mm, 1.64 ± 0.43 mm, and 1.67 ± 0.36 mm in anterior-posterior, lateral, and oblique directions, respectively. Prostate position identified on the OBI kV images is also found to be consistent with that derived from the implanted fiducials.  Conclusions:   Highly accurate, markerless prostate localization based on deep learning is achievable. The proposed method is useful for daily patient positioning and real-time target tracking during prostate radiotherapy.""","""['Wei Zhao', 'Bin Han', 'Yong Yang', 'Mark Buyyounouski', 'Steven L Hancock', 'Hilary Bagshaw', 'Lei Xing']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Radiother Oncol""","""['Artificial intelligence in image-guided radiotherapy: a review of treatment target localization.', 'Markerless Pancreatic Tumor Target Localization Enabled By Deep Learning.', 'The potential failure risk of the cone-beam computed tomography-based planning target volume margin definition for prostate image-guided radiotherapy based on a prospective single-institutional hybrid analysis.', 'A deep learning framework for automatic detection of arbitrarily shaped fiducial markers in intrafraction fluoroscopic images.', 'Image guided radiation therapy for prostate cancer; how, when and why?.', 'Human-level comparable control volume mapping with a deep unsupervised-learning model for image-guided radiation therapy.', 'Artificial intelligence in image-guided radiotherapy: a review of treatment target localization.', 'Machine learning applications in radiation oncology.', 'Development and Validation of an Interpretable Artificial Intelligence Model to Predict 10-Year Prostate Cancer Mortality.', 'Artificial intelligence in radiotherapy.']"""

Little is known about the effects of cancer therapies, specifically hormone therapies, on the course of IBD.  Methods:   We conducted a retrospective cohort study, collecting data from 5 medical centers, on patients with IBD who received a subsequent diagnosis of breast or prostate cancer from 1997 through 2018. For patients with quiescent IBD at their cancer diagnosis, the primary outcome was relapse of IBD. For patients with active IBD at their cancer diagnosis, the primary outcome was IBD remission.  Results:   Our analysis included 447 patients with IBD (44% with Crohn's disease, 53% with ulcerative colitis, and 3% with IBD unclassified) who had either breast (78%) or prostate (22%) cancer. At their cancer diagnosis, 400 patients (90%) had inactive IBD, and 47 (10%) had active IBD. Among patients with inactive IBD, 112 (28%) developed active IBD.

Irradiated cells are suggested to release growth-inhibitory/DNA-damaging factors transported to non-irradiated cells. However, the molecular nature of this phenomenon has not yet been resolved. We aimed at identifying the growth-inhibitory factor(s) transmitted to non-irradiated cells. RIBE-competent PC3 cells were used to produce conditioned medium (CM) after exposure to ionizing radiation. Indicator cells were incubated with CM and clonogenic survival as well as cell proliferation were determined as endpoints. A549 indicator cells exhibited a bystander effect upon incubation with CM from irradiated PC3 cells. This bystander effect was not due to DNA-damaging factors, but a radiation-triggered reduction of mitogenic/clonogenic activity present in CM. Several tumor cells, but not normal fibroblasts secrete this factor, whose release is reduced by irradiation. We identified L-Plastin to be responsible for the mitogenic/clonogenic activity. Removal of L-Plastin from CM by immunoprecipitation or siRNA-mediated knockdown of L-Plastin expression resulted in loss or reduction of mitogenic/clonogenic activity transmitted via CM, respectively. Exosome-transported L-Plastin was constitutively Ser5-phosphorylated, indicative of its bioactive conformation. In summary, we observed production and exosomal secretion of L-Plastin by cancer cells. Via exosome-transmitted L-Plastin, tumors induce clonogenic and mitogenic activity in cancer and normal cells of the tumor microenvironment. Irradiation inhibits L-Plastin production targeting both cancer cells and the tumor niche and may explain the high impact of radiotherapy in tumor control.""","""['Lena Katharina Freudenmann', 'Claus Mayer', 'H Peter Rodemann', 'Klaus Dittmann']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Exp Cell Res""","""['An evaluation of novel real-time technology as a tool for measurement of radiobiological and radiation-induced bystander effects.', 'Enhanced DNA double-strand break repair of microbeam targeted A549 lung carcinoma cells by adjacent WI38 normal lung fibroblast cells via bi-directional signaling.', 'Exosome-mediated microRNA transfer plays a role in radiation-induced bystander effect.', 'Radiation-Induced Bystander Effect can be Transmitted Through Exosomes Using miRNAs as Effector Molecules.', 'Radiation-induced bystander effect: the important part of ionizing radiation response.

Material and methods:   155 patients diagnosed with metastatic PC with a follow-up of up to 39 months. Data taken from the National PC Registry. The evaluated variables were age, PSA, nadir PSA, Gleason, perineural invasion, TNM stages, and ADT type (intermittent/continuous).  Results:   Mean follow-up 26,2±13,4 months. 47.1% developed early CR, with mean time until onset of 12,2±8,7 months. Univariate analysis the mean PSA was correlated with CR (290±905,1 ng/mL in non CR, 519,1±1437,2 ng/mL in CR, P<.001), mean age (73,3±8,3 years in non CR, 69,1±9,3 in CR P=.01), mean PSA nadir (15,5±57,3ng/mL in non CR, 15,9±23,7 ng/mL in CR, p<0,001), Gleason (in ≥8, HR:2,11. 95% CI: 1.22-3.65, p=0.006), and T stage (in T3-T4, HR: 2.85. 95% CI: 1.57-5.19, P<.001).

Lipid droplets (LDs) are key organelles, which are associated with stress response mechanisms in cells and their size falls into that niche. LDs composition is heterogeneous and varies depending on cancer cell type and the tumor microenvironment. Prostate cancer cells show a unique lipid metabolism manifested by an increased requirement for lipid accumulation in cytosolic LDs. In the current work, AFM-IR nanoimaging was undertaken to analyze lipids in untreated and x-ray irradiated PC-3 prostate cancer cells. Cells poor in LDs showed slightly increased lipid signal in cytoplasm close to the nucleus. On the other hand, high lipid signal coming from LDs accumulation could be found in any part of the cytoplasmic region. The observed behavior was found to be independent from irradiation and its dose. According to the band assignment of the collected AFM-IR spectra, the main components of LDs were assigned to cholesteryl esters. The size of LDs present in cells poor in lipids was found to be of less than 1 μm, whereas LDs aggregates spread out over a few microns.

Because both of these genes are lost genetically in prostate cancer, they cannot be directly targeted. We applied an established computational systems pharmacology approach (TRAP) to identify altered signaling pathways and associated druggable targets. We compared gene expression profiles of prostate cancer with coloss of CHD1 and MAP3K7 with prostate cancer diploid for these genes using The Cancer Genome Atlas patient samples. This analysis prioritized druggable target genes that included CDK1 and CDK2. We validated that inhibitors of these druggable target genes, including the CDK1/CDK2 inhibitor dinaciclib, had antiproliferative and cytotoxic effects selectively on mouse prostate cells with knockdown of Chd1 and Map3k7. Dinaciclib had stronger effects on prostate cells with suppression of Map3k7 independent of Chd1 and also compared with cells without loss of Map3k7. Dinaciclib treatment reduced expression of homologous recombination (HR) repair genes such as ATM, ATR, BRCA2, and RAD51, blocked BRCA1 phosphorylation, reduced RAD51 foci formation, and increased γH2AX foci selectively in prostate cells with suppression of Map3k7, thus inhibiting HR repair of chromosomal double-strand breaks. Dinaciclib-induced HR disruption was also observed in human prostate cells with knockdown of MAP3K7. Cotreatment of dinaciclib with DNA-damaging agents or PARP inhibitor resulted in a stronger cytotoxic effect on prostate cells with suppression of MAP3K7 compared with those without loss of MAP3K7, or to each single agent. IMPLICATIONS: These findings demonstrate that loss of MAP3K7 is a main contributing factor to drug response through disruption of HR in prostate cancer.""","""['Satoshi Washino', 'Leah C Rider', 'Lina Romero', 'Lauren K Jillson', 'Trisiani Affandi', 'Angela M Ohm', 'Elaine T Lam', 'Mary E Reyland', 'James C Costello#', 'Scott D Cramer#']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Mol Cancer Res""","""['Suppression of homologous recombination sensitizes human tumor cells to IGF-1R inhibition.', 'MAP3K7 Loss Drives Enhanced Androgen Signaling and Independently Confers Risk of Recurrence in Prostate Cancer with Joint Loss of CHD1.', 'Coordinate loss of MAP3K7 and CHD1 promotes aggressive prostate cancer.', 'Therapeutic exploitation of tumor cell defects in homologous recombination.', 'The emerging role of homologous recombination repair and PARP inhibitors in genitourinary malignancies.', 'UNC13B Promote Arsenic Trioxide Resistance in Chronic Lymphoid Leukemia Through Mitochondria Quality Control.', 'Intra-epithelial non-canonical Activin A signaling safeguards prostate progenitor quiescence.', 'Data-Driven Modeling of Breast Cancer Tumors Using Boolean Networks.', 'Identification of CDK2-Related Immune Forecast Model and ceRNA in Lung Adenocarcinoma, a Pan-Cancer Analysis.', 'Androgen Receptor Signaling in Prostate Cancer Genomic Subtypes.']"""

It has likewise been found that many cancer patients, including prostate cancer patients die of AIHD. Previously it has been delineated from our laboratory that dermcidin could induce anomalous platelet aggregation in AIHD and also impaired nitric oxide and insulin activity and furthermore dermcidin was also found in a few types of cancer patients. To determine the role of this protein in prostatic malignancy, a retrospective case-control study was conducted and blood was collected from prostate cancer patients and healthy normal volunteers. So, we measured the level of dermcidin protein and analyzed the IR by Homeostasis Model Assessment (HOMA) score calculation. Nitric oxide was measured by methemoglobin method. HDL, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), BMI, hs-cTroponin-T were measured for the validation of the patients' status in the presence of Dermcidin isoform-2 (DCN-2). Multiple logistic regression model adjusted for age and BMI identified that the HOMA score was significantly elevated in prostate cancer patients (OR = 7.19, P<0.001). Prostate cancer patients are associated with lower level of NO and higher level of both proteins dermcidin (OR = 1.12, P<0.001) and hs-TroponinT (OR = 1.76, P<0.001). From the results, it can be interpreted that IR plays a key role in the pathophysiology of prostate cancer where dermcidin was the cause of IR through NO inhibition leading to AIHD was also explained by high-sensitive fifth generation cTroponin-T (hs-cTroponinT) and HbA1c level which are associated with endothelial dysfunction.""","""['Udayan Ray', 'Sarbashri Bank', 'Madawa W Jayawardana', 'Jahar Bhowmik', 'Frank Redwig', 'Pradipta Jana', 'Suman Bhattacharya', 'Emili Manna', 'Subrata Kumar De', 'Smarajit Maiti', 'Philip Roberts-Thomson', 'Venkat Parameswaran', 'Asru K Sinha']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Biosci Rep""","""['Estriol Inhibits Dermcidin Isoform-2 Induced Inflammatory Cytokine Expression Via Nitric Oxide Synthesis in Human Neutrophil.', 'The appearance of dermcidin isoform 2, a novel platelet aggregating agent in the circulation in acute myocardial infarction that inhibits insulin synthesis and the restoration by acetyl salicylic acid of its effects.', 'Insulin resistance is inversely related to prostate cancer: a prospective study in Northern Sweden.', 'Glucose intolerance and insulin resistance as predictors of low platelet response to clopidogrel in patients with minor ischemic stroke or TIA.', 'Is serum C-reactive protein concentration correlated with HbA1c and insulin resistance in Type 2 diabetic men with or without coronary heart disease?']"""

Concerns about PSA-values are often expressed by patients in clinical situations. Today there is a lack of larger studies that have investigated the association between PSA-value and distress. The aim was to investigate the association between PSA-values and distress adjusted for sociodemographic factors, hormonal therapy and quality of life (QoL), among men with prostate cancer.  Methods:   In this cross-sectional survey of 3165 men with prostate cancer, members of the Swedish Prostate Cancer Federation, answered questions about sociodemographic factors, PSA, distress, QoL and treatments. Descriptive statistics, and bivariate and multivariable analyses were performed. The result was presented based on four PSA-value groups: 0-19, 20-99, 100-999, and ≥ 1000 ng/ml.  Results:   Of the men, 53% experienced distress. An association between distress and PSA-values was found where higher PSA-values were associated with higher OR:s for experiencing distress in the different PSA-groups: 0-19 ng/ml (ref 1), 20-99 ng/ml (OR 1.25, 95% CI 1.01-1.55), 100-999 ng/ml (OR 1.47, 95% CI 1.12-1.94), ≥1000 ng/ml (OR 1.77, 95% CI 1.11-2.85). These associations were adjusted for sociodemographic factors and hormonal therapy. In the multivariable analyses, beside PSA-values, higher levels of distress were associated with being without partner or hormonal therapy. When adding QoL in the multivariable analysis, the association between PSA and distress did not remain significant.  Conclusion:   These results indicate that the PSA-values are associated with distress, especially for those with higher values. However, to be able to support these men, continued research is needed to gain more knowledge about the mechanisms behind the association between emotional distress and PSA-values.""","""['Ulrika Rönningås', 'Per Fransson', 'Maja Holm', 'Agneta Wennman-Larsen']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""BMC Urol""","""['Psychological impact of serial prostate-specific antigen tests in Japanese men waiting for prostate biopsy.', 'Psychological distress and prostate specific antigen levels in men with and without prostate cancer.', 'Circulating Prostate-Specific Antigen and Telomere Length in a Nationally Representative Sample of Men Without History of Prostate Cancer.', 'Preliminary toxicity and prostate-specific antigen response of a Phase I/II trial of neoadjuvant hormonal therapy, 103Pd brachytherapy, and three-dimensional conformal external beam irradiation in the treatment of locally advanced prostate cancer.', 'Psychological aspects of PSA testing.', 'Signs and symptoms in relation to progression, experiences of an uncertain illness situation in men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer-A qualitative study.']"""

In 2012, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommended against prostate cancer screening to address overdetection and overtreatment. This study sought to determine the effect of guideline changes on prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening and initial diagnostic stage for prostate cancer.  Patients and methods:   A difference-in-differences analysis was conducted to compare changes in PSA screening (exposure) relative to cholesterol testing (control) after the 2012 USPSTF guideline changes, and chi-square test was used to determine whether there was a subsequent decrease in early-stage, low-risk prostate cancer diagnoses. Data were derived from a tertiary academic medical center's electronic health records, a national commercial insurance database (OptumLabs), and the SEER database for men aged ≥35 years before (2008-2011) and after (2013-2016) the guideline changes.  Results:   In both the academic center and insurance databases, PSA testing significantly decreased for all men compared with the control. The greatest decrease was among men aged 55 to 74 years at the academic center and among those aged ≥75 years in the commercial database. The proportion of early-stage prostate cancer diagnoses (<T2) decreased across age groups at the academic center and in the SEER database.  Conclusions:   In primary care, PSA testing decreased significantly and fewer prostate cancers were diagnosed at an early stage, suggesting provider adherence to the 2012 USPSTF guideline changes.

A simple and cost-effective method for fabricating paper-based devices was presented in this work by using of dipping strategy with the recycled polystyrene in chloroform as the hydrophobic reagent. Adhesive tape was employed as mask to transfer the hydrophilic channel pattern to the paper substrate. With the single-sided adhesive tape stuck on the hydrophilic parts of the paper surface, the paper-based device was immersed in chloroform solution with dissolving recycling polystyrene for several seconds. Then the hydrophilic pattern can be achieved and all the other parts on the paper surface were hydrophobic. The adhesive tape was torn off from the hydrophilic parts. The highest contact angle value of 114° of the hydrophobic part was acquired with this simple fabrication method. By using of the sandwich-type immunoreactions and luminol-H2O2p-iodophenol (PIP) chemiluminescence(CL) system, three cancer biomarkers were simultaneously detected in human serum samples on μPADs with the linear range of 0.05-80.0 ng·mL-1 for carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), 5.0-80.0 ng·mL-1 for alpha-fetal protein (AFP) and 1.0-50.0 ng·mL-1 for prostate-specific antigen (PSA).

Recent studies have been suggested cardioprotective actions of Rb1. However, the actions of Rb1 in vascular calcification, one of the significant pathological features associated with aging and atherosclerosis, have not been examined. In the present study, we examined the effects of Rb1 on vascular calcification, focusing on its androgen-like actions. Using inorganic phosphate (Pi)-induced calcification of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC), we found that Rb1, like testosterone, significantly inhibited calcium deposition in a concentration-dependent manner. Further, this inhibition of Rb1 was abolished by bicalutamide, an androgen receptor antagonist, but not by MPP or PHTPP, estrogen receptor α or β antagonists. Rb1 significantly inhibited apoptosis, one of the regulatory mechanisms of calcification, and restored growth arrest-specific gene 6 (Gas6) expression that was suppressed by Pi. Moreover, Rb1 transactivated Gas6, and proximal androgen-responsive element (ARE) of the promoter region was found to be crucial for Gas6 transactivation. In contrast, in a human prostate cancer cell line, testosterone-induced ARE activity was abrogated by Rb1. This antagonistic effect was also confirmed by the transrepression and downregulation of prostate-specific antigen in the presence of testosterone and Rb1 together. Thus, these findings provide a novel mechanistic insight into the vasculoprotective actions of Rb1 as a selective androgen receptor modulator, i.e., inhibitory effects on VSMC calcification through androgen receptor-mediated Gas6 transactivation and antagonistic effects in prostate cancer cells.""","""['Michiko Nanao-Hamai', 'Bo-Kyung Son', 'Aya Komuro', 'Yusuke Asari', 'Tsuyoshi Hashizume', 'Ken-Ichi Takayama', 'Sumito Ogawa', 'Masahiro Akishita']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Eur J Pharmacol""","""['Protective effects of estrogen against vascular calcification via estrogen receptor α-dependent growth arrest-specific gene 6 transactivation.', 'Androgen receptor-dependent transactivation of growth arrest-specific gene 6 mediates inhibitory effects of testosterone on vascular calcification.', 'Vitamin K2 inhibits rat vascular smooth muscle cell calcification by restoring the Gas6/Axl/Akt anti-apoptotic pathway.', 'Ginsenoside Rb1 as an Anti-Diabetic Agent and Its Underlying Mechanism Analysis.', 'Mechanism of pi-induced vascular calcification.', 'Functional compounds of ginseng and ginseng-containing medicine for treating cardiovascular diseases.', 'Advances in the Bioactivities of Phytochemical Saponins in the Prevention and Treatment of Atherosclerosis.', 'Recent progress (2015-2020) in the investigation of the pharmacological effects and mechanisms of ginsenoside Rb1, a main active ingredient in Panax ginseng Meyer.', 'Ginsenoside Rb1 Ameliorates Diabetic Arterial Stiffening via AMPK Pathway.', 'Gut microbiota: a potential target for traditional Chinese medicine intervention in coronary heart disease.']"""

Emerging data suggest molecular subtypes of PCa, including two somatic genetic aberrations: fusions of androgen-regulated promoters with ERG and, separately, phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) loss. We examined associations between family history and incidence of these subtypes in 44,126 men from the prospective Health Professionals Follow-up Study. ERG and PTEN status were assessed by immunohistochemistry. Multivariable competing risks models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for associations between self-reported family history of PCa and molecular subtypes of disease. Thirteen percent of men had a positive family history of PCa at baseline. During a median follow-up of 18.5 years, 5,511 PCa cases were diagnosed. Among them, 888 were assayed for ERG status (47% ERG-positive) and 715 were assayed for PTEN loss (14% PTEN null). Family history was more strongly associated with risk of ERG-negative (HR: 2.15; 95% CI: 1.71-2.70) than ERG-positive (HR: 1.49; 95% CI: 1.13-1.95) disease (pheterogeneity : 0.04). The strongest difference was among men with an affected father (HRERG-negative : 2.09; 95% CI: 1.64-2.66; HRERG-positive : 1.30; 95% CI: 0.96-1.76; pheterogeneity : 0.01). Family history of PCa was positively associated with both PTEN null (HR: 2.10; 95% CI: 1.26-3.49) and PTEN intact (HR: 1.72; 95% CI: 1.39-2.13) PCa (pheterogeneity : 0.47). Our results indicate that PCa family history may be positively associated with PCa in all ERG and PTEN subtypes, suggesting a role of genetic susceptibility in their development.

This included patients on active surveillance, previous negative transrectal ultrasonography biopsies with persistently raised prostate-specific antigen/abnormal prostate on digital rectal examination and de-novo template biopsies. Two specialist uro-radiologists reported all the scans and the biopsies were performed by one experienced urologist. The cognitive biopsies were performed for PIRADS 3-5 lesions on MRI. Total of 330 patients underwent transperineal template biopsies and cognitive target biopsies were carried out in 75 patients who were included in the study. We evaluated the results as positive/negative cognitive biopsies and also according to the PIRAD scoring. Only the patients with prostate cancer on template biopsy histology were included.

Methods:   The ANN must be trained and validated before use for the pretreatment dose verification. Hence, 60 EPID fluence maps of the anteroposterior prostate and nasopharynx IMRT fields were used as an input for the ANN (feed forward type), and a dose map of those fluence maps that were acquired by two-dimensional Array Seven29TM as an output for the ANN.  Results:   After the training and validation of the neural network, the analysis of 20 IMRT anteroposterior fields showed excellent agreement between the ANN output and the dose map predicted by the treatment planning system. The average overall global and local γ field pass rate was greater than 90% for the prostate and nasopharynx fields, with the 2 mm/3% criteria.  Conclusion:   The results indicated that the ANN can be used as a fast and powerful tool for pretreatment dose verification, based on an EPID fluence map.

The objective of this study was to assess the clinical feasibility and safety of using compact rotating gantry with three-dimensional active scanning in delivery of carbon-ion radiotherapy (C-ion RT) for relatively stationary tumours.  Methods:   A prospective feasibility study was conducted with 10 patients who had been treated with C-ion RT using compact rotating gantry between April 2017 and April 2018 at Hospital of the National Institute of Radiological Sciences (NIRS) for head and neck and prostate cancers. The primary end point was evaluation of acute toxicities within 3 months of starting C-ion RT.  Results:   Out of 10 cases 8 were of head and neck cancers and 2 were of prostate cancers. All of those eight head and neck cases were of locally advanced stages. Both of the prostate cancer patients belong to intermediate risk categories. None of the patients developed even Grade 2 or more severe skin reactions. Six out of eight cases with head and neck cancers experienced Grade 2 mucosal reactions; however, nobody developed Grade 3 or more severe mucosal reactions. There was no gastrointestinal reaction observed in prostate cancer patients. One patient developed Grade 2 genitourinary reaction.  Conclusion:   C-ion RT using compact rotating gantry and three-dimensional active scanning is a safe and feasible treatment for relatively less mobile tumours.

Patients and methods:   We retrospectively evaluated 88 patients having breast cancer who underwent both bone scintigraphy and 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron-emission computed tomography/X-ray computed tomography (PET/CT) within an interval of 8 weeks between both examinations for comparison. The whole-body bone images were analyzed with fully automated software that was customized according to a Japanese multicenter database. The region of interest for FDG-PET was set to bone lesions in patients with bone metastasis, while the bone marrow of the ilium and the vertebra was used in patients without bone metastasis.  Results:   Thirty of 88 patients had bone metastasis. Extent of disease, bone scan index (BSI) which indicate severity of bone metastasis, the maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax), metabolic tumor volume (MTV), total lesion glycolysis (TLG), and serum tumor markers in patients with bone metastasis were significantly higher than those in patients without metastasis. The Kaplan-Meier survival curve showed that the overall survival of the lower BSI group was longer than that with the higher BSI group in patients with visceral metastasis. In the multivariate Cox proportional hazard model, BSI (hazard ratio (HR): 19.15, p = 0.0077) and SUVmax (HR: 10.12, p = 0.0068) were prognostic factors in patients without visceral metastasis, while the BSI was only a prognostic factor in patients with visceral metastasis (HR: 7.88, p = 0.0084), when dividing the sample into two groups with each mean value in patients with bone metastasis.

Lean and fat mass were quantified by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Muscle strength and function were measured using handgrip dynamometry and gait speed, respectively. Sarcopenia was defined as low adjusted appendicular lean mass [ALM; height-adjusted (ALMI), body mass index-adjusted (ALMBMI) and height and fat mass-adjusted (ALMHFM)] with weak handgrip strength and/or slow gait speed according to the following criteria: European Working Group on Sarcopenia in Older People [EWGSOP; both 2010 (EWGSOP1) and 2018 (EWGSOP2)], Foundation for the National Institutes of Health (FNIH) and International Working Group on Sarcopenia (IWGS).

While the study of the extremely rare genetic diseases, Menkes and Wilson, has highlighted the requirement for proper Cu acquisition and elimination in biological systems for cellular growth and proliferation, the importance of dedicated Cu transport systems, like the Cu chaperones ATOX1 and CCS, in the pathophysiology of cancer is not well defined. We found that ATOX1 was significantly overexpressed in human blood, breast, and skin cancer samples, while CCS was significantly altered in human brain, liver, ovarian, and prostate cancer when compared to normal tissue. Further analysis of genetic expression data in Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) revealed that ATOX1 is highly expressed in melanoma cell lines over other cancer cell lines. We previously found that Cu is required for BRAFV600E-driven MAPK signaling and melanomagenesis. Here we show that genetic loss of ATOX1 decreased BRAFV600E-dependent growth and signaling in human melanoma cell lines. Pharmacological inhibition of ATOX1 with a small molecule, DCAC50, decreased the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and reduced the growth of BRAF mutation-positive melanoma cell lines in a dose-dependent manner.

This study investigated the therapeutic value of DZ-50 agent in in vitro and in vivo models of advanced prostate cancer and the ability of the compound to overcome resistance to antiandrogen (enzalutamide) in prostate tumors.  Approach:   LNCaP and LNCaP-enzalutamide resistant human prostate cancer (LNCaP-ER) cells, as well as 22Rv1 and enzalutamide resistant, 22Rv1-ER were used as cell models. The effects of DZ-50 and the antiandrogen, enzalutamide (as single agents or in combination) on cell death, EMT-MET interconversion, and expression of IGFBP3 and the androgen receptor (AR), were examined. The TRAMP mouse model of prostate cancer progression was used as a pre-clinical model. Transgenic mice (20-wks of age) were treated with DZ-50 (100 mg/kg for 2 wks, oral gavage daily) and prostate tumors were subjected to immunohistochemical assessment of apoptosis, cell proliferation, markers of EMT and differentiation and IGFBP-3 and AR expression.

Results:   We found that treatment with DZ-50 enhanced the anti-tumor response to the antiandrogen via promoting EMT to MET interconversion, in vitro. This DZ-50-mediated phenotypic reversal to MET leads to prostate tumor re-differentiation in vivo, by targeting nuclear IGFBP-3 expression (without affecting AR). Analysis of human prostate cancer specimens and TCGA patient cohorts revealed that overexpression of IGBP-3 protein correlated with tumor recurrence and poor patient survival.  Conclusions:   These findings provide significant new insights into (a) the predictive value of IGFBP-3 in prostate cancer progression and (b) the antitumor action of DZ-50, [in combination or sequencing with enzalutamide] as a novel approach for the treatment of therapeutically resistant prostate cancer.""","""['Patrick J Hensley', 'Zheng Cao', 'Hong Pu', 'Haley Dicken', 'Daheng He', 'Zhaohe Zhou', 'Chi Wang', 'Shahriar Koochekpour', 'Natasha Kyprianou']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Am J Clin Exp Urol""","""['Reversion of epithelial-mesenchymal transition by a novel agent DZ-50 via IGF binding protein-3 in prostate cancer cells.', 'TGF-β receptor I inhibitor enhances response to enzalutamide in a pre-clinical model of advanced prostate cancer.', 'Multinucleation and Mesenchymal-to-Epithelial Transition Alleviate Resistance to Combined Cabazitaxel and Antiandrogen Therapy in Advanced Prostate Cancer.', 'Profiling Prostate Cancer Therapeutic Resistance.', 'Exploitation of the Androgen Receptor to Overcome Taxane Resistance in Advanced Prostate Cancer.', 'Anoikis in phenotypic reprogramming of the prostate tumor microenvironment.', 'Establishment of a five-enzalutamide-resistance-related-gene-based classifier for recurrence-free survival predicting of prostate cancer.', 'The Appalachian Career Training in Oncology (ACTION) Program: Preparing Appalachian Kentucky High School and Undergraduate Students for Cancer Careers.', 'Downregulation of LOX promotes castration-resistant prostate cancer progression via IGFBP3.', 'Restoring HOXD10 Exhibits Therapeutic Potential for Ameliorating Malignant Progression and 5-Fluorouracil Resistance in Colorectal Cancer.']"""

However, prostate cancer has often been a non-responder to anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapies. The objective of this study was to determine PD-1 and PD-L1 expression status and its correlation with clinical features of the patients. A total of 279 patients who underwent radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer were included in this study. PD-1 and PD-L1 expression in primary prostate tumors was detected using immunohistochemical staining. Analyses were made between PD-1/PD-L1 status and patients' age, ethnicity, body mass index (BMI), diabetes mellitus, tumor stage, lymph node metastasis, prostate-specific antigen (PSA), Gleason score, grade group, and survival. We found that 6.5 (standard deviation 14.3; range 0-161.6) tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes per high power field were positive for PD-1 staining and 50/279 (17.9%) tumors were positive for PD-L1 staining. PD-L1-positive tumors had significantly more PD-1-positive lymphocytes than PD-L1-negative tumors. The number of PD-1-positive lymphocytes was not correlated with any clinical features except that patients with diabetes had significantly less PD-1-positive lymphocytes than patients without diabetes. In contrast, more PD-L1-positive tumors were found in older patients (≥ 65 years), obese patients (BMI ≥ 30), and patients with advanced tumor stage, lymph node metastasis, and high Gleason score. Neither PD-1 nor PD-L1 status was correlated with ethnicity, PSA, or survival.

It has been recently demonstrated that expansion of primary cells into three-dimensional prostatic organoids better mimics prostate epithelial glands by recapitulating epithelial differentiation and cell polarity. Here, we sought to identify cell populations present in monolayer PrE cells and organoid culture, grown from the same patient, using single-cell RNA-sequencing. Single-cell RNA-sequencing is a powerful tool to analyze transcriptome profiles of thousands of individual cells simultaneously, creating an in-depth atlas of cell populations within a sample. Organoids consisted of six distinct cell clusters (populations) of intermediate differentiation compared to only three clusters in the monolayer prostate epithelial cells. Integrated analysis of the datasets allowed for direct comparison of the monolayer and organoid samples and identified 10 clusters, including a distinct putative prostate stem cell population that was high in Keratin 13 (KRT13), Lymphocyte Antigen 6D (LY6D), and Prostate Stem Cell Antigen (PSCA). Many of the genes within the clusters were validated through RT-qPCR and immunofluorescence in PrE samples from 5 additional patients. KRT13+ cells were observed in discrete areas of the parent tissue and organoids. Pathway analyses and lack of EdU incorporation corroborated a stem-like phenotype based on the gene expression and quiescent state of the KRT13+ cluster. Other clusters within the samples were similar to epithelial populations reported within patient prostate tissues. In summary, these data show that the epithelial stem population is preserved in PrE cultures, with organoids uniquely expanding intermediate cell types not present in monolayer culture.""","""['Tara McCray', 'Daniel Moline', 'Bethany Baumann', 'Donald J Vander Griend', 'Larisa Nonn']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Am J Clin Exp Urol""","""['Keratin Profiling by Single-Cell RNA-Sequencing Identifies Human Prostate Stem Cell Lineage Hierarchy and Cancer Stem-Like Cells.', 'Handling and Assessment of Human Primary Prostate Organoid Culture.', 'Prostate Organoid Cultures as Tools to Translate Genotypes and Mutational Profiles to Pharmacological Responses.', 'Better Being Single?

Although androgen receptor (AR) signaling is significant in the development and progression of PC, other molecular pathways contribute as well. Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor Gamma (PPARγ) has recently been implicated as an oncogene in PC, which may influence both the development and metastatic progression of the cancer. There are two isoforms of PPARγ, with PPARγ2 having an additional 30 amino acids at the amino terminus. Here, we investigated the differential expression and function of these two isoforms in benign and cancerous prostate epithelial cells. The findings from our immunohistochemistry (IHC) and RNA in situ hybridization experiments suggest that although both isoforms are expressed in benign human prostate tissue, PPARγ1 predominates in PC tissue. Our results from PC cell line experiments suggest that PPARγ1 contributes to the proliferation of some PC cells and that PPARγ2 represses PC cell growth. Our findings also suggest that PPARγ1 increases the growth and possibly the transformation of otherwise benign prostate epithelial cells. These results help to establish different roles for PPARγ isoforms in prostate cells, and support the hypothesis that PPARγ1 acts as an oncogene and that PPARγ2 acts as a tumor suppressor in prostate cells.""","""['Meghan M Salgia', 'Catherine C Elix', 'Sumanta K Pal', 'Jeremy O Jones']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Am J Clin Exp Urol""","""['Knockout and Restoration Reveal Differential Functional Roles of PPARγ1 and PPARγ2 in Chicken Adipogenesis.', 'Expression patterns of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma 1 versus gamma 2, and their association with intramuscular fat in goat tissues.', 'Noradrenaline represses PPAR (peroxisome-proliferator-activated receptor) gamma2 gene expression in brown adipocytes: intracellular signalling and effects on PPARgamma2 and PPARgamma1 protein levels.', 'The role of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma in prostate cancer.', 'Crosstalk between the Androgen Receptor and PPAR Gamma Signaling Pathways in the Prostate.', 'Molecular Modeling of Allosteric Site of Isoform-Specific Inhibition of the Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor PPARγ.', 'Diet and PPARG2 Pro12Ala Polymorphism Interactions in Relation to Cancer Risk: A Systematic Review.', 'PPAR Gamma: From Definition to Molecular Targets and Therapy of Lung Diseases.']"""

However, the clinical significance and biological effects of EYA2 in human prostate cancer remain unknown. In this study, we showed that increased levels of Eya2 protein correlated with advanced TNM stage, T stage, and a higher Gleason score. Data from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) prostate cohort consistently revealed that Eya2 mRNA was positively correlated with a higher Gleason score, higher T stage, and positive nodal metastasis in prostate cancer. Furthermore, data from the Oncomine database showed increased levels of EYA2 mRNA expression in prostate cancer tissues compared with normal tissues. Eya2 protein expression was also higher in prostate cancer cell lines compared with a normal RWPE-1 cell line. We selected LNCaP and PC-3 cell lines for plasmid overexpression and shRNA knockdown. CCK-8, colony formation, and Matrigel invasion assays demonstrated that the overexpression of Eya2 promoted proliferation, colony number, and invasion while Eya2 shRNA inhibited proliferation rate, colony formation, and invasion ability. CCK-8 and Annexin V assays showed that Eya2 reduced sensitivity to docetaxel and docetaxel-induced apoptosis while Eya2 shRNA showed the opposite effects. The overexpression of Eya2 also downregulated the cleavage of caspase3 and PARP while Eya2 depletion upregulated caspase3 and PARP cleavage. Notably, JC-1 staining demonstrated that Eya2 upregulated mitochondrial membrane potential. We further revealed that the overexpression of Eya2 upregulated Bcl-2, matrix metalloproteinase 7 (MMP7), and AKT phosphorylation. Accordingly, data from the TCGA prostate cohort indicated that EYA2 mRNA was positively correlated with the expression of Bcl-2 and MMP7. The inhibition of AKT attenuated EYA2-induced Bcl-2 upregulation. In conclusion, our data demonstrated that Eya2 was upregulated in prostate cancers.

Methods: qRT-PCR was used to detect the expression of AC024560.2 in 16 prostate cancer tissues and adjacent normal tissues, prostate cancer cell lines and normal prostate epithelial cells. The cells with the lowest expression amount were transfected, and the prostate cancer cells were divided into control group (transfected with negative control plasmid) and experimental group (transfected with plasmid carrying AC024560.2). Bioinformatics predicted possible target genes for AC024560.2. qRT-PCR was used to detect the expression of AC024560.2 and target genes in the transfected cells. Western blot was used to detect the expression of downstream target proteins. Cell proliferation and invasion were analyzed by MTS assay and Transwell invasion assay. Results: The expression levels of AC024560.2 in prostate cancer tissues and adjacent tissues were 1.95±0.22 and 3.87±0.23, respectively (t=6.09, P<0.01). Compared with normal prostate epithelial cells, the expression of AC024560.2 in prostate cancer cell lines was significantly decreased (P<0.05), and the most significant decrease was observed in C4-2B cell lines (P<0.01).

We used human and murine prostate cancer cell lines to examine the role of tumor burden in tumor aggressiveness, as well as its correlation with cancer stem cell (CSC) marker levels and IL-6 signaling. Furthermore, 167 prostate cancer biopsy specimens were analyzed in terms of correlations of IL-6 and CD44 levels with clinical patient characteristics. Data from preclinical models showed that larger tumor burden was associated with more aggressive tumor growth associated and increased CD44 expression. Using cellular experiments and orthotopic tumor models, we showed that CD44+ prostate cancer cells have CSC-like properties, enhanced epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and a more immunosuppressive microenvironment. There was a significant correlation between IL-6 and CD44 levels based on in vitro testing of clinical samples. Blockade of IL-6/STAT3 signaling attenuated the expression of CD44, CSC-like properties, and aggressive tumor behavior in vitro and in vivo. In conclusion, CD44 expression is significantly associated with tumor aggressiveness in prostate cancer and activation of IL-6 signaling leads to a suitable microenvironment for the induction of CD44 expression.

We analysed resilience (RS-11), depression (PHQ-9) and anxiety (GAD-7).  Results:   The resilience did not differ significantly between 5 and 10 years after diagnosis (5 years after diagnosis: M=58.5 / 10 years after diagnosis: 59.0; p=0.631). Significant connections between higher levels of resilience and lower levels of depression (beta=0.307; p<0.001), marital status (married, beta=0.080; p=0.016), higher levels of education (beta=0.101; p=0.002) and employment status (employed, beta=0.087; 0.008) could be shown. 20% of variance in resilience could be explained by the independent variables.  Discussion:   The results indicate that resilience is a stable trait, which is connected with particular values or combinations of values. Lower levels of resilience are associated with unsupported single patients, unemployed patients and patients with lower socioeconomic status.

Our data show that the hormone-dependent cells are comparatively insensitive to various PUFAs, at the same time as the growth and viability of hormone-independent cells lines are strongly inhibited by most of the tested PUFAs, whether n-3 or n-6. We speculate that this difference may be at least partially responsible for the observed effects of specific dietary lipids in prostate cancer. The new data strengthen the case for dietary intervention as part of potential new therapeutic strategies seeking to impede prostate cancer progression.""","""['Brenden A Bratton', 'Ivan V Maly', 'Wilma A Hofmann']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['A low dietary ratio of omega-6 to omega-3 Fatty acids may delay progression of prostate cancer.', 'The effects of omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids on in vitro prostate cancer growth.', 'Effects of adenoviral gene transfer of C. elegans n-3 fatty acid desaturase on the lipid profile and growth of human breast cancer cells.', 'Dietary N-6 and N-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids and prostate cancer risk: a review of epidemiological and experimental evidence.', 'Recent Evidence on the Role of Dietary PUFAs in Cancer Development and Prevention.', 'The Zooxanthellate Jellyfish Holobiont Cassiopea andromeda, a Source of Soluble Bioactive Compounds.', 'The suppressive role of nanoencapsulated chia oil against DMBA-induced breast cancer through oxidative stress repression and tumor genes expression modulation in rats.', 'Supplementation of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) and aerobic exercise improve functioning, morphology, and redox balance in prostate obese rats.', 'Effect of Palmitic Acid on Exosome-Mediated Secretion and Invasive Motility in Prostate Cancer Cells.', 'Dietary Fat and Cancer-Which Is Good, Which Is Bad, and the Body of Evidence.']"""

Our previous studies found high expression and oncologic role of high-mobility group nucleosome binding domain 5 (HMGN5) in prostate cancer. In this study, we found that miR-183-3p was downregulated in prostate cancer cells and primary tissues compared with normal controls. In addition, miR-183-3p expression was negatively correlated with HMGN5 expression. On the basis of bioinformatics predication and quantitative polymerase chain reaction and Western blot verification, it is demonstrated that miR-183-3p regulated HMGN5 expression. Luciferase reporter assay confirmed that miR-183-3p directly targeted the 3'-untranslated region of HMGN5. Interestingly, cell proliferation and migration inhibition and apoptosis induction were also observed in miR-183-3p transfected human prostate cancer VCap and C4-2 cells. Moreover, overexpression of HMGN5 significantly reversed the inhibitory effect on cell proliferation and migration and promoted effect on cell apoptosis by miR-183-3p.

Our objective was to develop a natural language processing (NLP) system to extract prostate pathology details from postoperative pathology reports and a parallel structured data entry process for use by urologists during routine documentation care and compare accuracy when compared with manual abstraction and concordance between NLP and clinician-entered approaches.  Materials and methods:   From February 2016, clinicians used note templates with custom structured data elements (SDEs) during routine clinical care for men with prostate cancer. We also developed an NLP algorithm to parse radical prostatectomy pathology reports and extract structured data. We compared accuracy of clinician-entered SDEs and NLP-parsed data to manual abstraction as a gold standard and compared concordance (Cohen's κ) between approaches assuming no gold standard.  Results:   There were 523 patients with NLP-extracted data, 319 with SDE data, and 555 with manually abstracted data. For Gleason scores, NLP and clinician SDE accuracy was 95.6% and 95.8%, respectively, compared with manual abstraction, with concordance of 0.93 (95% CI, 0.89 to 0.98). For margin status, extracapsular extension, and seminal vesicle invasion, stage, and lymph node status, NLP accuracy was 94.8% to 100%, SDE accuracy was 87.7% to 100%, and concordance between NLP and SDE ranged from 0.92 to 1.0.  Conclusion:   We show that a real-world deployment of an NLP algorithm to extract pathology data and structured data entry by clinicians during routine clinical care in a busy clinical practice can generate accurate data when compared with manual abstraction for some, but not all, components of a prostate pathology report.""","""['Anobel Y Odisho', 'Mark Bridge', 'Mitchell Webb', 'Niloufar Ameli', 'Renu S Eapen', 'Frank Stauf', 'Janet E Cowan', 'Samuel L Washington rd', 'Annika Herlemann', 'Peter R Carroll', 'Matthew R Cooperberg']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""JCO Clin Cancer Inform""","""['A natural language processing program effectively extracts key pathologic findings from radical prostatectomy reports.', 'Automating Access to Real-World Evidence.', 'Automated Extraction of Grade, Stage, and Quality Information From Transurethral Resection of Bladder Tumor Pathology Reports Using Natural Language Processing.', 'Contemporary grading for prostate cancer: implications for patient care.', 'Natural Language Processing in Nephrology.', 'Natural language processing in urology: Automated extraction of clinical information from histopathology reports of uro-oncology procedures.', 'An accessible, efficient, and accurate natural language processing method for extracting diagnostic data from pathology reports.', 'Assessment of Electronic Health Record for Cancer Research and Patient Care Through a Scoping Review of Cancer Natural Language Processing.', 'Expanding the Secondary Use of Prostate Cancer Real World Data: Automated Classifiers for Clinical and Pathological Stage.', 'A BERT model generates diagnostically relevant semantic embeddings from pathology synopses with active learning.']"""

In this work, a set of glyconanoparticles was prepared via self-assembly of amphiphilic glycoblock copolymers for the targeted delivery of a hydrophobic chemotherapy drug. Well-defined glycoblock copolymers that consist of 1,1-di-tert-butyl 3-(2-(metyloyloxy)ethyl)-butane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate (MAETC) together with three different protected-sugar moieties (β-d-glucopyranoside, β-d-mannopyranoside, and β-l-fucopyranoside) were synthesized by using reversible addition-fragmentation chain-transfer polymerization. Copolymers were deprotected and conjugated with the cis-dichlorodiammineplatinum(II) (cis-Pt) anticancer drug. Dynamic light scattering and transmission electron microscopy measurements revealed that cis-Pt-conjugated glyconanoparticles were sufficiently stable under physiological conditions and had diameters of approximately 100 nm with considerably narrow size distributions. They were intracellularly taken up by the breast cancer (MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231), prostate cancer (PC3), renal cancer (769-P), and Chinese hamster ovary cell lines. The PC3 and 769-P cell lines showed a high preference for the glycosylated nanoparticles. Glycoblock copolymers were found nontoxic but showed high cytotoxicity and increased efficacy after conjugation with the cis-Pt anticancer drug. Moreover, in vitro cytotoxicity assays in cancer cell lines demonstrate that cis-Pt-loaded glycopolymer-based nanoparticles have higher cytotoxicity than free cis-Pt. Overall, our results suggest that glyconanoparticles have a great potential to be used as an effective cis-Pt drug carrier for targeted cancer therapy.""","""['Aydan Dag', 'Pinar Sinem Omurtag Ozgen', 'Sezen Atasoy']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Biomacromolecules""","""['Glycopolymer decorated multiwalled carbon nanotubes for dual targeted breast cancer therapy.', 'An Acid-Triggered Degradable and Fluorescent Nanoscale Drug Delivery System with Enhanced Cytotoxicity to Cancer Cells.', 'Platinum covalent shell cross-linked micelles designed to deliver doxorubicin for synergistic combination cancer therapy.', 'Targeted Drug Delivery System for Platinum-based Anticancer Drugs.', 'Polymeric nanoparticles as carrier for targeted and controlled delivery of anticancer agents.', 'Layer-by-Layer assembled nano-drug delivery systems for cancer treatment.', 'Novel Honokiol-eluting PLGA-based scaffold effectively restricts the growth of renal cancer cells.', 'Surface-functionalised hybrid nanoparticles for targeted treatment of cancer.']"""

Objective:   To examine factors associated with lymphedema after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) and axillary lymph node dissection in women with node-positive breast cancer.  Design, setting, and participants:   This cohort study included data from 701 women 18 years or older with cT0-T4N1-2M0 breast cancer with documented axillary nodal metastasis at diagnosis who were enrolled in the American College of Surgeons Oncology Group Z1071 (Alliance for Clinical Trials in Oncology) trial, which took place from January 1, 2009, to December 31, 2012. Data analysis was performed from January 11, 2018, to November 9, 2018.  Interventions:   All participants received NAC, breast operation, and axillary lymph node dissection. Participants underwent prospective arm measurements and symptom assessment after NAC completion and at 6-month intervals to 36 months postoperatively.  Main outcomes and measures:   Factors associated with lymphedema were defined as self-reported arm heaviness or swelling (lymphedema symptoms) or an arm volume increase of 10% or more (V10) or 20% or more (V20).  Results:   A total of 486 patients (mean [SD] age, 50.1 [10.8] years) were included in this study. Median follow-up for the 3 measures was 2.2 to 3.0 years. Cumulative lymphedema incidence at 3 years was 37.8% (95% CI, 33.1%-43.2%) for lymphedema symptoms, 58.4% (95% CI, 53.2%-64.1%) for V10, and 36.9% (95% CI, 31.9%-42.6%) for V20. Increasing body mass index (hazard ratio [HR], 1.04; 95% CI, 1.01-1.06) and NAC for 144 days or longer (HR, 1.48; 95% CI, 1.01-2.17) were associated with lymphedema symptoms. The V20 incidence was higher among patients who received NAC for 144 days or longer (HR, 1.79; 95% CI, 1.19-2.68). The V10 incidence was highest in patients with 30 nodes or more removed (HR, 1.70; 95% CI, 1.15-2.52) and increased with number of positive nodes (HR, 1.03; 95% CI, 1.00-1.06). On multivariable analysis, obesity was significantly associated with lymphedema symptoms (HR, 1.03; 95% CI, 1.01-1.06), and NAC length was significantly associated with V20 (HR, 1.74; 95% CI, 1.15-2.62).

Automatic plan generation for 20 prostate patients was achieved via a stand-alone automated planning script that accessed a knowledge-based planning solution. Differences between the auto plans and clinically treated, baseline plans were analyzed and compared. The planning script successfully initialized a treatment plan, accessed the knowledge-based planning model, optimized the plan, assessed for constraint compliance, and normalized the treatment plan for maximal coverage while meeting constraints. Compared to baseline plans, the auto-generated plans showed significantly improved rectal sparing with similar coverage for targets and comparable doses to the remaining organs-at-risk.

Neuroendocrine prostate cancer, in particular, is associated with an aggressive phenotype and a poor prognosis. Neuroendocrine cells produce and secrete peptide hormones and growth factors in a paracrine/autocrine manner which promote the progression of the disease. Recent studies have demonstrated that extracellular vesicles or exosomes are released by prostate cancer cells, supporting the spread of prostate cancer. Hence, the aim of this study was to investigate the effect of growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH) on neuroendocrine differentiation (NED) in the androgen-dependent prostate cancer cell line LNCaP and the molecular mechanisms underlying these effects. GHRH induced an increase in the percentage of neurite-bearing cells and in the protein levels of Neuron-Specific Enolase. Both effects were blocked by the GHRH receptor antagonist MIA-690. In addition, pretreatment of these cells with the calcium chelator BAPTA, the EGFR inhibitor AG-1478 or the HER2 inhibitor AG-825 reduced the effect of GHRH, suggesting that the GHRH-induced stimulation of NED involves calcium channel activation and EGFR/HER2 transactivation. Finally, PC3-derived exosomes led to an increase in NED, cell proliferation and cell adhesion.

Thus, it is critical to discover new therapeutics to treat prostate cancer. Diosgenin is a steroidal saponin from Trigonella foenum graecum, which has been previously identified to exert anti-tumor properties. Neural precursor cell expressed developmentally down-regulated protein 4 (NEDD4) is an E3 ligase that degrades multiple different proteins, and plays an oncogenic role in human cancer. In this study, we explore the molecular mechanism by which diosgenin mediates anti-tumor effects in prostate cancer cells. We found that diosgenin treatment led to cell growth inhibition, apoptosis and cell cycle arrest. Notably, we found that diosgenin inhibited the expression of NEDD4 in prostate cancer cells. Furthermore, overexpression of NEDD4 overcame the diosgenin-mediated anti-tumor activity, while downregulation of NEDD4 promoted the diosgenin-induced anti-cancer function in prostate cancer cells.

A patient was admitted to our department for a persistent dermatological lesion and adverse evolution despite debridements and the administration of antibiotics. He was followed for prostate cancer, high blood pressure and asthma. Due to observed biological abnormalities such as neutrophil leukocytosis with myelocyte and metamyelocyte myeloma, without blood blastosis and normochromic normocytic anemia, chronic myelogenous leukemia was suspected. It was later overturned by the various inconclusive supplementary examinations. This is how the diagnosis of PG was evoked and confirmed by anatomopathological examination showing a histopathological appearance of granulation tissue consistent with pyoderma gangrenosum and no sign of malignancy.

For example, EGR1 levels increase in response to suppressed androgen receptor signaling or loss of the tumor suppressor, PTEN. EGR1 has been shown to regulate genes influencing proliferation, apoptosis, immune cell activation, and matrix degradation, among others. Despite this, the impact of EGR1 on PC metastatic colonization is unclear. We demonstrate using a PC model (DU145/RasB1) of bone and brain metastasis that EGR1 expression regulates angiogenic and osteoclastogenic properties of metastases. We have shown previously that FN14 (TNFRSF12A) and downstream NF-κB signaling is required for metastasis in this model. Here we demonstrate that FN14 ligation also leads to NF-κB-independent, MEK-dependent EGR1 expression. EGR1-depletion in DU145/RasB1 cells reduced both the number and size of metastases but did not affect primary tumor growth. Decreased EGR1 expression led to reduced blood vessel density in brain and bone metastases as well as decreased osteolytic bone lesion area and reduced numbers of osteoclasts at the bone-tumor interface. TWEAK (TNFSF12) induced several EGR1-dependent angiogenic and osteoclastogenic factors (e.g., PDGFA, TGFB1, SPP1, IL6, IL8, and TGFA, among others). Consistent with this, in clinical samples of PC, the level of several genes encoding angiogenic/osteoclastogenic pathway effectors correlated with EGR1 levels. Thus, we show here that EGR1 has a direct effect on prostate cancer metastases. EGR1 regulates angiogenic and osteoclastogenic factors, informing the underlying signaling networks that impact autonomous and microenvironmental mechanisms of cancer metastases.""","""['Lechen Li', 'Amir H Ameri', 'Simeng Wang', 'Keith H Jansson', 'Orla M Casey', 'Qi Yang', 'Michael L Beshiri', 'Lei Fang', 'Ross G Lake', 'Supreet Agarwal', 'Aian N Alilin', 'Wanhai Xu', 'JuanJuan Yin', 'Kathleen Kelly']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Oncogene""","""['Egr1 transcription factor: multiple roles in prostate tumor cell growth and survival.', 'PC-3-Derived Exosomes Inhibit Osteoclast Differentiation by Downregulating miR-214 and Blocking NF-κB Signaling Pathway.', 'Activation of NF-kappa B signaling promotes growth of prostate cancer cells in bone.', 'Notch3 promotes prostate cancer-induced bone lesion development via MMP-3.', 'Is EGR1 a potential target for prostate cancer therapy?', 'Immunogenomic profiles associated with response to life-prolonging agents in prostate cancer.', 'CNN2 silencing inhibits colorectal cancer development through promoting ubiquitination of EGR1.', 'Animal models of cancer metastasis to the bone.', 'Mapping the Response of Human Osteocytes in Native Matrix to Mechanical Loading Using RNA Sequencing.', 'EGR1 induces EMT in pancreatic cancer via a P300/SNAI2 pathway.']"""

The Hi-Myc/HIT mice had increased incidence and invasiveness of prostate cancer.

Since UPR can serve as a lever between survival and death, regulated control of its activity is critical for tumor formation and growth although the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Here we show that one of the main transcriptional effectors of UPR, activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4), is essential for prostate cancer (PCa) growth and survival. Using systemic unbiased gene expression and proteomic analyses, we identified a novel direct ATF4 target gene, family with sequence similarity 129 member A (FAM129A), which is critical in mediating ATF4 effects on prostate tumorigenesis. Interestingly, FAM129A regulated both PERK and eIF2α in a feedback loop that differentially channeled the UPR output. ATF4 and FAM129A protein expression is increased in patient PCa samples compared with benign prostate. Importantly, in vivo therapeutic silencing of ATF4-FAM129A axis profoundly inhibited tumor growth in a preclinical PCa model.

Furthermore, studies have shown that PCa prognosis during CADT was correlated to the extent of testosterone collapse. The aim of this study was to assess the link between testosterone levels at the end of the first off-treatment phase and time to occurrence of castrate-resistant prostate cancer.  Methods:   We retrospectively analyzed the files of 69 patients having undergone IADT. Intermittence was offered to the patients showing PSA<4ng/mL after at least six months of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) using a LHRH analog. CRPC was defined according to the AFU oncological guidelines. Patients were sorted into three groups according to their testosterone levels at the end of the first off-treatment phase T<0.5ng/mL, 0.5<T<3.4ng/mL and T>3.4ng/mL. CRPC free-survival, metastasis-free survival and overall survival as well as adverse events frequency were compared between the groups. The impact of initial ADT duration on CRPC occurrence, mean off-treatment phase duration and IADT duration was also studied.  Results:   Testosterone levels at the end of the first and second off-treatment phases were not linked to time to CRPC occurence (p=0.5), mestastasis occurence (p=0.4) or death (p=0.3). It was associated neither with adverse effects frequency (p=0.2) nor with cancer-related complications (p=0.6). Initial ADT duration was not linked to CRPC occurrence (p=0.6), mean off-treatment phase duration (p=0.5) or mean IADT duration (p=0.6).  Conclusion:   This study did not show any link between testosterone levels at the end of the first off-treatment phase (before reintroducing ADT) and overall survival, metastasis-free survival and CRPC-free survival. Likewise, it was not associated with the frequency of adverse events or cancer-related complications.

LS174T cells were treated with IL-20, IL-22, and IL-24 (25, 50, and 100 ng/mL) and a live-cell imaging system was used to evaluate the effects on cell proliferation. Following treatment, the signaling pathways contributing to cell proliferation were investigated through Western blotting in LS174T cells and downstream transcriptional changes through qRT-PCR in LS174T cells, and RNA-Seq in primary murine intestinal epithelial cells. Our results demonstrated that only IL-22 promoted LS174T cell proliferation, mediated via extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2-mediated downstream regulation of p90RSK, c-Jun, and transcriptional changes of TRIM15 and STOM. IL-22 also promoted expression of ERK1/2-independent genes such as DDR2, LCN2, and LRG1, which are known to be involved in cell proliferation and migration.

While several voices in the medical physics community have advocated for variable RBE-based optimization, the uncertainties in RBE models have prevented its implementation in clinical practice, since an overestimation of RBE could cause significant target underdosage.  Methods:   We propose a mixed RBE model (MultiRBE), where a uniform RBE is used in the target contours to ensure an adequate tumor coverage in terms of physical dose, but a variable RBE is used elsewhere. Our model was implemented in the open-source treatment planning system matRad and three example cases were planned: a homogeneous phantom, a prostate tumor and a head-and-neck case. MultiRBE was used for plan optimization, and the produced plans were subsequently evaluated in terms of physical dose coverage (V95% ) and variable RBE-weighted dose in organs at risk and normal tissue complication probabilities (NTCP), where prediction models were available.  Results:   The planning algorithm showed potential for reducing the biological dose in organs surrounding the planning target and thus decreasing the probability for complications in normal tissue (by up to 62% in the prostate case and 37% in the head-and-neck patient). This was achieved without compromising the target coverage or homogeneity in terms of physical dose, as a result of a smarter redistribution of dose among the surrounding tissues with regard to the optimization constraints.

SPA produced an AR-mediated, dose-dependent induction of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), G0/G1 cell cycle arrest and cellular senescence. SPA repressed genes involved in DNA repair and delayed the restoration of damaged DNA which was augmented by PARP1 inhibition.

The roles of dysregulated microRNAs in PCa remain unclear. In this study, we mined the public published data and found that miR-487a-3p was significantly downregulated in 38 pairs of clinical prostate tumor tissues compared with the normal tissues. We further verified this result by in situ hybridization on tissue chip and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) in PCa/normal cells. miR-487a-3p targeting of cyclin D1 (CCND1) was identified using bioinformatics, qRT-PCR and western blot analyses. The cellular proliferation, cell cycle, migration, and invasion were assessed by cell counting kit-8, flow cytometry analysis and transwell assay. We discovered that overexpression of miR-487a-3p suppressed PCa cell growth, migration, invasion by directly targeting CCND1. Knockdown of CCND1 in PCa cells showed similar results. Meanwhile, the expression level of CCND1 was significantly upregulated in the PCa tissues and cell lines, which presented negative correlation with the expression of miR-487a-3p. More important, we demonstrated significantly reduced growth of xenograft tumors of stable miR-487a-3p-overexpressed human PCa cells in nude mice. Taken together, for the first time, our results revealed that miR-487a-3p as a tumor suppressor of PCa could target CCND1. Our finding might reveal miR-487a-3p could be potentially contributed to the pathogenesis and a clinical biomarker or the new potential therapeutic target of PCa.""","""['Mingming Wang', 'Wanpeng Yu', 'Jun Gao', 'Wenqiang Ma', 'Macro Frentsch', 'Andreas Thiel', 'Mei Liu', 'Nafis Rahman', 'Zhihai Qin', 'Xiangdong Li']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""J Cell Physiol""","""['Long Noncoding RNA Small Nucleolar RNA Host Gene 3 Mediates Prostate Cancer Migration, Invasion, and Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition by Sponging miR-487a-3p to Regulate TRIM25.', 'Long Noncoding RNA HOXD-AS1 Promotes the Proliferation, Migration, and Invasion of Colorectal Cancer via the miR-526b-3p/CCND1 Axis.', 'MicroRNA-590-3p promotes cell proliferation and invasion by targeting inositol polyphosphate 4-phosphatase type II in human prostate cancer cells.', 'Stromal-induced downregulation of miR-1247 promotes prostate cancer malignancy.', 'Mechanism and function of miR-140 in human cancers: A review and in silico study.', 'MicroRNAs in T Cell-Immunotherapy.', 'Tumor immune checkpoints and their associated inhibitors.', 'RASAL2 regulates the cell cycle and cyclin D1 expression through PI3K/AKT signalling in prostate tumorigenesis.', 'Cyclin D1 mediated by the nuclear translocation of nuclear factor kappa B exerts an oncogenic role in lung cancer.', 'PSMC2/CCND1 axis promotes development of ovarian cancer through regulating cell growth, apoptosis and migration.']"""

The six core functions of patient-centered communication (PCC)-fostering healing relationships, exchanging information, responding to emotions, managing uncertainty, making decisions, and enabling patient self-management-represent a central component to facilitating a survivor's confidence to manage their health that has not been investigated in cancer survivors with multiple chronic conditions.  Method:   Nationally representative data across two iterations of the Health Information National Trends Survey (HINTS) were merged with combined replicate weights using the jackknife replication method. Adjusted linear regression examined the association between PCC and health self-efficacy in a sample of breast, colorectal, and prostate cancer survivors and by multiple chronic conditions.  Results:   53.9% reported that providers did not always respond to their emotions and 48.9% reported that they could not always rely on their providers to help them manage uncertainty. In the adjusted linear regression models, there was a significant positive association between PCC and health self-efficacy (β = 0.2, p = 0.01) for the entire sample. However, the association between PCC and health self-efficacy was attenuated in cancer survivors with multiple chronic conditions (β = 0.1, p = 0.53).  Conclusion:   PCC alone is not enough to improve a cancer survivor's confidence in their ability to manage their health in the presence of multiple chronic conditions.  Implications for cancer survivors:   Cancer survivors with multiple chronic conditions need ongoing support, in addition to PCC, that render them prepared to manage their health after cancer.""","""['Jessica D Austin', 'Michael C Robertson', 'L Aubree Shay', 'Bijal A Balasubramanian']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""J Cancer Surviv""","""[""Trends in cancer survivors' experience of patient-centered communication: results from the Health Information National Trends Survey (HINTS)."", 'The effect of cancer treatment summaries on patient-centered communication and quality of care for cancer survivors: A pooled cross-sectional HINTS analysis.', 'Predictors of Patient-Centered Communication among U.S. Adults: Analysis of the 2017-2018 Health Information National Trends Survey (HINTS).', 'Measuring patient-centered communication in cancer care: a literature review and the development of a systematic approach.', 'National consensus recommendations on patient-centered care for ductal carcinoma in situ.', 'Do discussions of financial burdens decrease long-term financial toxicity in adolescent and young adult cancer survivors?', 'US Older Adults with Multiple Chronic Conditions Perceptions of Provider-Patient Communication: Trends and Racial Disparities from MEPS 2013-2019.', 'Association Between Patient Portal Use and Perceived Patient-Centered Communication Among Adults With Cancer: Cross-sectional Survey Study.', 'Understanding the Delivery of Patient-Centered Survivorship Care Planning: An Exploratory Interview Study With Complex Cancer Survivors.', 'How clinician-patient communication affects trust in health information sources: Temporal trends from a national cross-sectional survey.']"""

The added value of micro-ultrasound and MRI over systematic biopsy is presented.  Methods:   Sixty-seven consecutive subjects (January-August 2018) from our prospective database who underwent prostate biopsy using the micro-ultrasound system were included. 19/67 had prostate MRI imaging available. MRI targets were sampled using the UroNav fusion system. Patients had a median PSA of 5.37 ng/mL (IQR 4.13-8.74).  Results:   38/67 (56.7%) subjects were positive for prostate cancer. In six of these cases, systematic biopsy was negative with only micro-ultrasound targeted samples detecting cancer. In two other cases, patients were upgraded from Grade Group 1 to Grade Groups 4 and 2 based on micro-ultrasound targets. Micro-ultrasound targets detected cancer in two subjects where MRI was negative (Grade Groups 3 and 2). MRI targets alone did not change the overall diagnosis of any subjects. Switching biopsy guidance to real-time micro-ultrasound increased detection rate on prostate biopsy from 44.8% (30/67) to 56.7% (38/67), a relative increase of 26.7%.  Conclusion:   High-resolution micro-ultrasound identified clinically significant cancer that would have, otherwise, been missed by both MRI fusion and systematic biopsy and was useful in both biopsy naïve and repeat negative patients.

Numerous studies have determined that constitutively active androgen receptor (AR) signaling or full-length AR bypass mechanisms may contribute to the resistance. Previous studies established that AKR1C3 and AR-V7 play important roles in enzalutamide and abiraterone resistance. In the present study, we found that AKR1C3 increases AR-V7 expression in resistant prostate cancer cells through enhancing protein stability via activation of the ubiquitin-mediated proteasome pathway. AKR1C3 reprograms AR signaling in enzalutamide-resistant prostate cancer cells. In addition, bioinformatical analysis of indomethacin-treated resistant cells revealed that indomethacin significantly activates the unfolded protein response, p53, and apoptosis pathways, and suppresses cell-cycle, Myc, and AR/ARV7 pathways. Targeting AKR1C3 with indomethacin significantly decreases AR/AR-V7 protein expression in vitro and in vivo through activation of the ubiquitin-mediated proteasome pathway.

PSA fall by ≥30% at 4wk (PSA4w30) has been reported to be associated with better outcome in a single-centre cohort study.  Objective:   To evaluate clinical relevance of early PSA decline in mCRPC patients treated with next-generation hormonal treatments (NGHTs) such as abiraterone and enzalutamide.  Design, setting, and participants:   This was a retrospective multicentre analysis. Eligible patients received NGHT for mCRPC between 6 January 2006 and 31 December 2017 in 13 cancer centres worldwide, and had PSA levels assessed at baseline and at 4 and/or 12wk after treatment. PSA response was defined as a ≥30% decline (progression as a ≥25% increase) from baseline.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Association with overall survival (OS) was analysed using landmark multivariable Cox regression adjusting for previous chemotherapy, including cancer centre as a shared frailty term.  Results and limitations:   We identified 1358 mCRPC patients treated with first-line NGHT (1133 had PSA available at 4wk, and 948 at both 4 and 12wk). Overall, 583 (52%) had a PSA4w30; it was associated with longer OS (median: 23; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 21-25) compared with no change (median: 17; 95% CI: 15-18) and progression (median: 13; 95% CI: 10-15). A PSA12w30 was associated with lower mortality (median OS 22 vs 14; hazard ratio=0.57; 95% CI=0.48-0.67; p<0.001). PSA4w30 strongly correlated with PSA12w30 (ρ=0.91; 95% CI=0.90-0.92; p<0.001). In total, 432/494 (87%) with a PSA4w30 achieved a PSA12w30. Overall, 11/152 (7%) patients progressing at 4wk had a PSA12w30 (1% of the overall population).  Conclusions:   PSA changes in the first 4wk of NGHT therapies are strongly associated with clinical outcome from mCRPC and can help guide early treatment switch decisions.

Locally advanced and/or high-risk cancer is defined based on clinical stage, initial PSA value or high Gleason score. Hormone therapy associated with radiation therapy is the standard of management and improves local control, reduces the risk of distant metastasis and improves specific and overall survival. Duration of hormone therapy, dose level of radiation therapy alone or associated with brachytherapy are controversial data in the literature. Radical prostatectomy surgery is a therapeutic option that must be performed with extensive lymph node dissection and is often part of a multimodal care sequence. The therapeutic choice, multidisciplinary, depends on the age and co-morbidity of the patient, the prognostic criteria of the pathology and the urinary function of the patient.

Several types of complications can occur during systemic treatment in prostate cancer, depending on the therapeutic range. The most common with hormone therapy are fatigue, muscle loss, bone loss, high blood pressure and metabolic syndromes. For chemotherapy, the most significant risk is related to hematological toxicity, but peripheral neuropathies, mucositis, diarrhea and hypersensitivity reactions may also occur. The quality of the pre-treatment assessment and the rigorousness of patient follow-up make it possible to anticipate most of these events, to prevent them or to manage them at an early stage when they occur. The most important aspect is patient education, which involves comprehensive information and the implementation of supportive care as soon as the treatment is initiated. Specialized advice (e. g. cardiological or endocrinological) is recommended in the event of uncontrolled symptomatology. The resumption of treatment leading to a major complication should be the subject of a multidisciplinary discussion taking into account the severity of the event, its reversibility, the patient's life expectancy and the expected efficacy of the molecule.""","""['N Houédé']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Prog Urol""","""['Chemotherapy combined with androgen-deprivation therapy in high-volume metastatic hormone sensitive prostate cancer: a short-term efficacy and safety analysis.', 'Hormone-refractory prostate cancer: a shifting paradigm in treatment.', 'Adverse effects of androgen-deprivation therapy in prostate cancer and their management.', 'Background to and management of treatment-related bone loss in prostate cancer.', 'Chemotherapy in hormone refractory prostatic carcinoma.']"""

Because of the diversity of human cancers with p53 mutations, these findings raise important questions whether this mechanism operates in different cancer types with same or different p53 mutations. In this study, we investigated whether PEITC recuses mutant p53 in prostate cancer cells harboring different types of p53 mutants, structural and contact, in vitro and in vivo.  Methods:   Cell proliferation, cell apoptosis and cell cycle arrest assays were performed to examine the effects of PEITC on prostate cancer cell lines with p53 mutation(s), wild-type p53, p53 null or normal prostate cells in vitro. Western blot analysis was used to monitor the expression levels of p53 protein, activation of ATM and upregulation of canonical p53 targets. Immunoprecipitation, subcellular protein fraction and qRT-PCR was performed to determine change in conformation and restoration of transactivation functions/ inhibition of gain-of-function (GOF) activities to p53 mutant(s). Mice xenograft models were established to evaluate the antitumor efficacy of PEITC and PEITC-induced reactivation of p53 mutant(s) in vivo. Immunohistochemistry of xenograft tumor tissues was performed to determine effects of PEITC on expression of Ki67 and mutant p53 in vivo.  Results:   We demonstrated that PEITC inhibits the growth of prostate cancer cells with different ""hotspot"" p53 mutations (structural and contact), however, preferentially towards structural mutants. PEITC inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis by rescuing mutant p53 in p53R248W contact (VCaP) and p53R175H structural (LAPC-4) mutant cells with differential potency. We further showed that PEITC inhibits the growth of DU145 cells that co-express p53P223L (structural) and p53V274F (contact) mutants by targeting p53P223L mutant selectively, but not p53V274F. The mutant p53 restored by PEITC induces apoptosis in DU145 cells by activating canonical p53 targets, delaying cells in G1 phase and phosphorylating ATM. Importantly, PEITC reactivated p53R175H and p53P223L/V274F mutants in LAPC-4 and DU145 prostate xenograft models, respectively, resulting in significant tumor inhibition.

Methods:   Between 2000 to 2014, 214 mRCC patients, of whom 171 (79.9%) were intermediate-risk and 43 (20.1%) were poor-risk, were retrospectively selected; 126 (58.9%) patients were treated with immunotherapy (IT) and 88 (41.1%) with targeted therapy (TT). Moreover, 144 patients had synchronous mRCCs (67.3%, SM) and 70 had metachronous mRCCs (32.7%, MM).

Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate whether STI pathogens (Atopobium vaginae (ATO), Neisseria gonorrhoeae (NG), Chlamydia tra-chomatis (CT), Treponema pallidum (TP), Ureaplasma urealyticum (UU), Gardnerella vaginalis (GV), Herpes Sim-plex Virus (HSV), Cytomegalovirus (CMV), Human herpesvirus (HHV), Human papillomavirus (HPV), and Tricho-monas vaginalis (TV)) presence in prostate tissues are associated with the risk of prostate cancer.  Methods:   Paraffin-embedded prostate tissues obtained from patients with hyperplasia and prostate cancer were extracted. Determination of infectious microorganisms of interest was done by quantitative TaqMan real-time PCR assay.  Results:   STI DNA was detected in 53/243 (21.8%) of the prostate tissues samples (ATO 3.7%, UU 2.88%, GV 2.46%, HSV-2 2.05%, CT 2.05%, CMV 1.64%, NG 1.64%, TP 1.64%, HHV-8 1.23%, HPV 1.23%, and TV 1.23%.)

Conclusions:   No statistically significant difference was observed in the prevalence of most candidate infectious or-ganisms between hyperplasia and cancerous groups except for GV and HSV-2. It appears that inflammation in the prostate gland is more associated with prostate hyperplasia than prostate cancer.

These images can be difficult to segment because of weak or insufficient landmarks or strong artifacts. We devise a method, based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs), that produces accurate segmentations on easy and difficult images alike. We propose two strategies to achieve improved segmentation accuracy on difficult images. First, for CNN training we adopt an adaptive sampling strategy, whereby the training process is encouraged to pay more attention to images that are difficult to segment. Secondly, we train a CNN ensemble and use the disagreement among this ensemble to identify uncertain segmentations and to estimate a segmentation uncertainty map. We improve uncertain segmentations by utilizing the prior shape information in the form of a statistical shape model. Our method achieves Hausdorff distance of 2.7 ± 2.3 mm and Dice score of 93.9 ± 3.5%. Comparisons with several competing methods show that our method achieves significantly better results and reduces the likelihood of committing large segmentation errors. Furthermore, our experiments show that our approach to estimating segmentation uncertainty is better than or on par with recent methods for estimation of prediction uncertainty in deep learning models. Our study demonstrates that estimation of model uncertainty and use of prior shape information can significantly improve the performance of CNN-based medical image segmentation methods, especially on difficult images.""","""['Davood Karimi', 'Qi Zeng', 'Prateek Mathur', 'Apeksha Avinash', 'Sara Mahdavi', 'Ingrid Spadinger', 'Purang Abolmaesumi', 'Septimiu E Salcudean']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Med Image Anal""","""['Fast interactive medical image segmentation with weakly supervised deep learning method.', 'A deep learning method for real-time intraoperative US image segmentation in prostate brachytherapy.', 'Automatic prostate segmentation using deep learning on clinically diverse 3D transrectal ultrasound images.', 'Automatic Segmentation of Multiple Organs on 3D CT Images by Using Deep Learning Approaches.', 'Review on Deep Learning Methodologies in Medical Image Restoration and Segmentation.', 'Research progress on deep learning in magnetic resonance imaging-based diagnosis and treatment of prostate cancer: a review on the current status and perspectives.', 'QU-BraTS: MICCAI BraTS 2020 Challenge on Quantifying Uncertainty in Brain Tumor Segmentation - Analysis of Ranking Scores and Benchmarking Results.', 'Improving the Segmentation Accuracy of Ovarian-Tumor Ultrasound Images Using Image Inpainting.', 'Ultrasound Prostate Segmentation Using Adaptive Selection Principal Curve and Smooth Mathematical Model.', 'Learning to segment fetal brain tissue from noisy annotations.']"""

RNA G-quadruplex (rG4) sequences have been described as structures with high stability and selectivity towards cancer cells. Recently, precursor microRNAs (pre-miRNAs) have been described as new G4 forming molecules. Surface nucleolin (NCL) is a known target of aptamer G4 AS1411 and is overexpressed on prostate cancer cells when compared with normal cells. We have shown that the sequence 5' GGGAGGGAGGGACGGG 3' found in pre-miR-149 forms a rG4 parallel structure, which can bind NCL. Also, another rG4 sequence with a longer loop was evaluated in terms of G4 formation, stabilization and binding affinity to NCL. Both rG4s sequences were studied as supramolecular carriers for the cancer-selective delivery of acridine ligand C8. The rG4s-C8 complexes showed high affinity (KD = 10-6 M) and stabilization (Tm > 30 °C). The affinity of the rG4s-C8 complexes against NCL was in the low nanomolar range, indicating that C8 did not affect NCL binding. Noteworthy, the short loop rG4-C8 complex showed selective antiproliferative effects in prostate cancer cells when compared with normal prostatic cells. The stability and nuclease resistance of rG4 and rG4-C8 complex were evaluated in biological conditions and revealed the maintenance of G4 structure and complex stability. Furthermore, confocal microscopy studies confirmed the potential of rG4s-C8 complexes in the targeting of prostate cancer cells. Overall, it is here demonstrated that the rG4 found in pre-miR-149 can be used as a cancer-selective delivery carrier of C8 to prostate cancer cells.""","""['Tiago Santos', 'Patrícia Pereira', 'Maria Paula Cabral Campello', 'António Paulo', 'João A Queiroz', 'Eurico Cabrita', 'Carla Cruz']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Eur J Pharm Biopharm""","""['Recognition of nucleolin through interaction with RNA G-quadruplex.', 'AS1411 derivatives as carriers of G-quadruplex ligands for cervical cancer cells.', 'Aptamer-based Targeted Delivery of a G-quadruplex Ligand in Cervical Cancer Cells.', 'G-quadruplex oligonucleotide AS1411 as a cancer-targeting agent: Uses and mechanisms.', 'G-quadruplex-based aptamers against protein targets in therapy and diagnostics.', 'Gallic Acid-Triethylene Glycol Aptadendrimers Synthesis, Biophysical Characterization and Cellular Evaluation.', 'Progress in cancer drug delivery based on AS1411 oriented nanomaterials.', 'Ligands as Stabilizers of G-Quadruplexes in Non-Coding RNAs.', 'Aptamer-conjugated mesoporous polydopamine for docetaxel targeted delivery and synergistic photothermal therapy of prostate cancer.', 'G-Quadruplexes and Their Ligands: Biophysical Methods to Unravel G-Quadruplex/Ligand Interactions.']"""

It can be used for the visual detection of the prostate specific antigen (PSA) based on contact angle readout. Magnetic beads were modified with primary antibody against PSA. After immunobinding, gold nanoparticles loaded with secondary antibody labeled with glucose oxidase is added. On addition of glucose, gluconic acid is formed which causes a drop in the local pH value. This results in a wettability switch of the pH-responsive superwettable chip from hydrophobic to hydrophilic. Under the optimized conditions, PSA can be quantified with a 3.2 pg mL-1 limit of detection by analyzing the contact angle and the related color that changes from blue via orange to red. The method is applicable to PSA detection in serum samples and for visual classification by cancer patients and healthy persons. It is also suitable for color-blind and color-weak individuals. Conceivably, this kind of assay can be transferred to the determination of various kinds of other bioanalytes including nucleotide, proteins, and even of ions and small organic molecules, and thus is has a wide scope.

In the last years, a new treatment approach with stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) has shown promising results. The aim of the present study was to directly compare the toxicity and outcome between hRT and SBRT in low and favorable intermediate PCa patients.  Materials and methods:   The hRT schedules were: 71.4 Gy or 74.2 Gy in 28 fractions for low- or favorable intermediate-risk PCa, respectively, while the SBRT schedules were: 35 Gy or 37.5 Gy in five fractions, for low or favorable intermediate risk, respectively. Toxicity assessment was performed according to CTCAE v5.0 grading. The International Prostatic Symptoms Score (IPSS) was also recorded.  Results:   One hundred forty-nine patients were analyzed, overall 81 (54.36%) patients were low risk and 68 (45.64%) were favorable intermediate risk. Sixty-nine (46.3%) patients were treated with hypo-RT and 80 (53.7%) with SBRT. Median follow-up was 33 months (range 11-58 months). The actuarial survival rate was 98.66%. The 3-years BFS rates were 95.5% and 100% for hRT and SBRT, respectively (p = 0.051). One case (0.6%) of acute grade 3 urinary toxicity occurred in a patient with favorable intermediate risk treated with hRT. He initially suffered gross hematuria and acute urinary retention not treatable with urinary catheter, therefore a suprapubic catheter was placed and steroids were administered. No differences in acute, late or severe toxicity were detected.  Conclusion:   Stereotactic body radiotherapy reported a good clinical outcome and safe toxicity profile. Results are comparable to hRT, but a longer follow-up is needed to assess the late effectiveness and toxicity.""","""['Luca Nicosia', 'Rosario Mazzola', 'Michele Rigo', 'Vanessa Figlia', 'Niccolò Giaj-Levra', 'Giuseppe Napoli', 'Francesco Ricchetti', 'Stefanie Corradini', 'Ruggero Ruggieri', 'Filippo Alongi']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""J Cancer Res Clin Oncol""","""['Early Tolerance and Tumor Control Outcomes with High-dose Ultrahypofractionated Radiation Therapy for Prostate Cancer.', 'Intensity-modulated fractionated radiotherapy versus stereotactic body radiotherapy for prostate cancer (PACE-B): acute toxicity findings from an international, randomised, open-label, phase 3, non-inferiority trial.', 'Stereotactic body radiotherapy with a focal boost to the MRI-visible tumor as monotherapy for low- and intermediate-risk prostate cancer: early results.', 'Hypofractionated Radiotherapy for Localized Prostate Cancer: When and for Whom?', 'Extreme Hypofractionation with SBRT in Localized Prostate Cancer.', 'Linac-based versus MR-guided SBRT for localized prostate cancer: a comparative evaluation of acute tolerability.', 'Stereotactic Magnetic Resonance-Guided Adaptive and Non-Adaptive Radiotherapy on Combination MR-Linear Accelerators: Current Practice and Future Directions.', 'A Prospective Study of Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy (SBRT) with Concomitant Whole-Pelvic Radiotherapy (WPRT) for High-Risk Localized Prostate Cancer Patients Using 1.5 Tesla Magnetic Resonance Guidance: The Preliminary Clinical Outcome.', 'Implementation of Magnetic Resonance Imaging-Guided Radiation Therapy in Routine Care: Opportunities and Challenges in the United States.', 'Postoperative moderately hypofractionated radiotherapy in prostate cancer: a mono-institutional propensity-score-matching analysis between adjuvant and early-salvage radiotherapy.']"""

Diabetics are at an increased risk for cancer. Previous studies have demonstrated improved outcomes in patients taking metformin suffering from prostate, colon, lung, thyroid, and esophageal cancers. Metformin's main antineoplastic mechanism of action is thought to be mediated through inhibition of mammalian target of rapamycin, inhibition of hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) alpha, and activation of p53. We investigated the overall survival of type 2 diabetic patients on metformin with pancreatic cancer and lymphoma using the Computerized Patient Record System at the Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Memphis TN.  Methods:   Lymphoma and pancreatic cancer patients with type 2 diabetes were sorted into an experimental (metformin) group and a control (nonmetformin) group. Patients were compared on baseline characteristics including race, body mass index, and age. Cancer outcomes including overall survival, metastasis, recurrences, and incidence of new malignancies were recorded. Hemoglobin A1C, creatinine and cancer treatment modalities were recorded and compared. Statistical analyses used included unpaired t tests and Chi-squared tests.  Results:   There was significantly greater overall long-term survival in the metformin group compared to the nonmetformin group for lymphoma (5.89 vs 1.29 years, P < 0.001) and for pancreatic cancer (0.68 vs 0.22 years, P = 0.016). Cancer treatment modalities in both groups were comparable.  Conclusions:   Metformin is associated with a significant, positive effect of increased overall survival in type 2 diabetes patients with pancreatic cancer and lymphoma.

However, the role of EpCAM expression remains inconsistent. We conducted a meta-analysis to assess the clinicopathological and prognostic significance of EpCAM expression in PCa.  Methods:   Publications were searched online using electronic databases. The available data were obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). The odds ratios (ORs) or hazard ratios (HRs) with their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated.  Results:   We identified seven studies in which immunohistochemistry was used and that included 871 prostatic tissue samples. EpCAM expression was significantly higher in PCa samples than in benign and normal tissue samples (OR = 77.93, P = 0.002; OR = 161.61, P < 0.001; respectively). No correlation of EpCAM overexpression with pT stage and lymph node metastasis was observed; however, EpCAM overexpression showed a significant correlation with Gleason score (OR = 0.48, P = 0.012) and bone metastasis (OR = 145.80, P < 0.001). Furthermore, TCGA data showed that EpCAM overexpression was not closely correlated with age, pT stage, lymph node metastasis, number of lymph node, prostate-specific antigen level, Gleason score, biochemical recurrence, and overall survival. Based on multivariate Cox proportional-hazards regression analysis, a significant correlation was observed between EpCAM overexpression and 5-year worse biochemical recurrence free-survival.  Conclusions:   EpCAM overexpression may be correlated with the development of bone metastasis and worse biochemical recurrence free-survival of PCa.

However, few causal variants and their regulatory mechanisms have been characterized. In this study, we utilized our previously developed single-nucleotide polymorphisms sequencing (SNPs-seq) technology to test allele-dependent protein binding at 903 SNP sites covering 28 genomic regions. All selected SNPs have shown significant cis-association with at least one nearby gene. After preparing nuclear extract using LNCaP cell line, we first mixed the extract with dsDNA oligo pool for protein-DNA binding incubation. We then performed sequencing analysis on protein-bound oligos. SNPs-seq analysis showed protein-binding differences (>1.5-fold) between reference and variant alleles in 380 (42%) of 903 SNPs with androgen treatment and 403 (45%) of 903 SNPs without treatment. From these significant SNPs, we performed a database search and further narrowed down to 74 promising SNPs. To validate this initial finding, we performed electrophoretic mobility shift assay in two SNPs (rs12246440 and rs7077275) at CTBP2 locus and one SNP (rs113082846) at NCOA4 locus. This analysis showed that all three SNPs demonstrated allele-dependent protein-binding differences that were consistent with the SNPs-seq. Finally, clinical association analysis of the two candidate genes showed that CTBP2 was upregulated, while NCOA4 was downregulated in prostate cancer (p < 0.02). Lower expression of CTBP2 was associated with poor recurrence-free survival in prostate cancer.

Transcriptional intermediary factor 1γ (TIF1γ) which is a vital protein molecule that possesses ubiquitination enzyme activity, can mediate TGF-β induced EMT. We aimed to investigate the detailed mechanism between VPA and EMT occurrence in PCa cells to clarify the potential mechanism of TIF1γ involved. In our vitro experiments, we first investigated the effect of VPA on the expression TIF1γ. After TIF1γ was knockdown or overexpressed by related lentivirus, EMT of PCa cells were assessed. When TIF1γ knockdown or overexpress stable cell line were established, cells were treated with additional VPA, EMT index were detected and functional experiments were also conducted to confirm whether VPA inhibited EMT of PCa cells via TIF1γ. The mono-ubiquitination of Smad4 was analyzed simultaneously. In vivo, mice were facilitated with PC3 cells or TIF1γ related knockdown or overexpress virus transfected PC3 cells with or without VPA administration. Results showed that in vitro VPA can increase the expression of TIF1γ and also induce the increase expression of E-cadherin, and the decrease of N-cadherin and vimentin. Knocking down of TIF1γ can effectively block the effect of VPA on EMT and metastasis while overexpression of TIF1γ can strengthen its role. In vivo VPA also showed its anti-growth effect including tumor growth and EMT mediated by TIF1γ coincide with in vitro experiments. In conclusion, VPA inhibits the EMT in PCa cells via up-regulating the expression of TIF1γ and the mono-ubiquitination Smad4.

Design, setting, and participants:   In this prognostic study, CXR-risk CNN development (n = 41 856) and testing (n = 10 464) used data from the screening radiography arm of the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial (PLCO) (n = 52 320), a community cohort of asymptomatic nonsmokers and smokers (aged 55-74 years) enrolled at 10 US sites from November 8, 1993, through July 2, 2001. External testing used data from the screening radiography arm of the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) (n = 5493), a community cohort of heavy smokers (aged 55-74 years) enrolled at 21 US sites from August 2002, through April 2004. Data analysis was performed from January 1, 2018, to May 23, 2019.  Exposure:   Deep learning CXR-risk score (very low, low, moderate, high, and very high) based on CNN analysis of the enrollment radiograph.  Main outcomes and measures:   All-cause mortality. Prognostic value was assessed in the context of radiologists' diagnostic findings (eg, lung nodule) and standard risk factors (eg, age, sex, and diabetes) and for cause-specific mortality.  Results:   Among 10 464 PLCO participants (mean [SD] age, 62.4 [5.4] years; 5405 men [51.6%]; median follow-up, 12.2 years [interquartile range, 10.5-12.9 years]) and 5493 NLST test participants (mean [SD] age, 61.7 [5.0] years; 3037 men [55.3%]; median follow-up, 6.3 years [interquartile range, 6.0-6.7 years]), there was a graded association between CXR-risk score and mortality.

Abundance of miR‑198 in prostate cancer and association with clinical characteristics was analyzed using a CPC‑Gene prostate cancer dataset. Overexpression of miR‑198 was performed using transient transfection of miR‑198 mimic prior to assaying proliferation, cell cycle, and colony formation in LNCaP and DU145 cell lines using standard protocols. In vivo tumor formation in athymic nude mice was examined using LNCaP xenografts with stable overexpression conferred using lentiviral miR‑198 transduction. Protein and mRNA abundance of MIB1 was determined using western blotting and RT‑qPCR respectively, while miR‑198 binding to MIB1 was validated using a luciferase reporter assay. miR‑198 abundance was lower in high Gleason grade prostate cancer relative to intermediate and low‑grade cancer. Overexpression of miR‑198 diminished proliferation of prostate cancer cell lines, increased G0/G1 cell cycle arrest, and significantly impaired colony formation. Elevated miR‑198 abundance was also demonstrated to impair tumor formation in vivo using LNCaP xenografts. Mindbomb E3 ubiquitin protein ligase 1 (MIB1) was demonstrated to be directly targeted by miR‑198, and knockdown of MIB1 recapitulated the effects of miR‑198 on proliferation and colony formation.

Piezo type mechanosensitive ion channel component 1 (Piezo1), which functions as a cell sensor and transducer of mechanical stimuli, may have a crucial role in the development of prostate cancer. In the present study, the expression of the Piezo1 channel was demonstrated to be significantly elevated in prostate cancer cell lines and in human prostate malignant tumor tissues. Downregulation of Piezo1 significantly suppressed the viability, proliferation and migration of prostate cancer cells in vitro, and inhibited prostate tumor growth in vivo. The activation of the Akt/mTOR pathway or acceleration of cell cycle progression from G0/G1 to S phase may downstream consequences of Piezo 1 signal pathway activation. Downregulation of Piezo1 considerably suppressed Ca2+ signal increments, inhibited the phosphorylation of Akt and mTOR and arrested the cell cycle of prostate cancer cells at G0/G1 phase in while inhibiting the activation of CDK4 and cyclin D1. Taken together, these findings suggest that Piezo1 channels have a crucial role in prostate cancer development and may, therefore, be a novel therapeutic target in the treatment of prostate cancer.""","""['Yu Han', 'Chao Liu', 'Dongfang Zhang', 'Hongchao Men', 'Lifang Huo', 'Qiaowei Geng', 'Shengnan Wang', 'Yiting Gao', 'Wei Zhang', 'Yongjian Zhang', 'Zhanfeng Jia']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Int J Oncol""","""['GOLM1 promotes prostate cancer progression through activating PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling.', 'Mechanically activated ion channel Piezo1 contributes to melanoma malignant progression through AKT/mTOR signaling.', 'Depletion of SAG/RBX2 E3 ubiquitin ligase suppresses prostate tumorigenesis via inactivation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR axis.', 'Piezo-type mechanosensitive ion channel component 1 (Piezo1) in human cancer.', 'The role of mechanosensitive Piezo1 channel in diseases.', 'Cellular mechanotransduction in health and diseases: from molecular mechanism to therapeutic targets.', 'Identification of Piezo1 as a potential target for therapy of colon cancer stem-like cells.', 'Potassium Ion Channels in Glioma: From Basic Knowledge into Therapeutic Applications.', 'Calcium signalling pathways in prostate cancer initiation and progression.', 'Matrix stiffness induces epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition via Piezo1-regulated calcium flux in prostate cancer cells.']"""

In a recent study, one possibility has been brought up that growth in the transition zone due to BPH may cause pressure-induced fibrotic changes in the peripheral zone, an area where 80% of cancer occurs, leading to gland atrophy and the thickening of the prostatic capsule. To shed more light on this phenomenon, we conducted a pilot study examining the quantitative and qualitative histo-anatomical changes that occur in the peripheral zone associated with BPH.  Methods:   Thirty-nine prostate specimens of various sizes were selected from patients who had undergone radical prostatectomies. Each prostate was evaluated in six different locations along the dorsal aspect of the peripheral zone by measuring the thickness of the peripheral fibrotic zone (prostate capsule) and its association with gland atrophy. Multiple regression analysis was performed to determine the relationship between prostate size and the average thickness of the prostate capsule.  Results:   Multiple regression analysis revealed a strong, positive relationship between prostate size and average capsule thickness with a Pearson coefficient of 0.707 (p < 0.05). Fibrotic histo-anatomical changes were spatially associated with gland atrophy: glands found within the peripheral fibrotic zone appeared elongated and atrophic.  Conclusion:   The results suggest that BPH may be associated with the development of fibrotic material and atrophy of glands within the peripheral zone. Because this atrophy involves glands where 80% of prostate cancer originates, this potentially explains the inverse relationship between PCa and BPH.""","""['Joshua M Frost', 'Lisa A Smith', 'Pranav Sharma', 'Werner T de Riese']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Int Urol Nephrol""","""['Association between prostate size and glandular tissue volume of the peripheral zone via novel combined MRI and histopathology: possible pathophysiological implications on prostate cancer development.', 'Quantitative measurements of prostate capsule and gland density and their correlation to prostate size: possible clinical implications in prostate cancer.', 'Possible clinical implications of prostate capsule thickness and glandular epithelial cell density in benign prostate hyperplasia.', 'Any Correlation Between Prostate Volume and Incidence of Prostate Cancer: A Review of Reported Data for the Last Thirty Years.', 'Prostate gland-transition zone lesions.

Nowadays, with advances in biotechnology, earthworm is considered a rich natural source of many biomolecules that possesses antioxidant and antitumor activities. The present study aimed to evaluate the antitumor activity of earthworm powder (Lumbricus terrestris) against two cell lines, breast cancer cells (MCF-7) and prostate cancer cells (PC-3).  Methods:   Fully matured earthworms (L. terrestris) were collected from soil in Baghdad, Iraq. To assess the cytotoxicity of earthworm powder, the MTT assay was conducted on cancerous (MCF-7 and PC-3 cells) and normal cell line (WRL68 cells) lines.  Results:   It was revealed that earthworm powder exerts cytotoxic effects against two cancer cell lines. The viability of MCF-7 and PC-3 cells decreased with increasing the concentration. The IC50 values for PC-3 and MCF-7 cell lines were 265.5 and 965.9 μg/ml, respectively, while the earthworm powder exhibited no cytotoxicity against the WRL68 cells. According to the analysis of the results of the multiple cytotoxicity assay (HCS), the treatment of PC-3 cells with 100, 200, and 400 μg/ml of earthworm powder for 24 h at 37 °C led to cell death by changing the permeability of mitochondrial membrane resulting in cytochrome C release and inducing apoptosis.  Conclusion:   The results of the present study contribute additional evidence for the antitumor activity of earthworm extracts.

In addition, increased PSMA expression correlates with castration resistance and progression to the metastatic stage of the disease. Recently, we combined both an albumin-binding motif and an irreversible PSMA inhibitor to develop the novel PSMA-targeted radiotherapeutic agent, CTT1403. This molecule was novel in the field of PSMA-targeted agents as its key motifs resulted in extended blood circulation time and tumor uptake, rapid and extensive internalization into PSMA+ cells, and promising therapeutic efficacy. The objective of this study was to perform IND-enabling translational studies on CTT1403 in rodent models.  Procedures:   A dose optimization study was performed in PC3-PIP (PSMA+) tumor-bearing mice. Treatment groups were randomly selected to receive one to three 14-MBq injections of CTT1403. Control groups included (1) saline, (2) non-radioactive [175Lu]CTT1403, or (3) two injections of 14 MBq CTT1751, a Lu-177-labeled non-targeted albumin-binding moiety. Tumor growth was monitored up to 120 days. Small-animal single photon emission tomography/X-ray computed tomography imaging was performed with CTT1403 and CTT1751 in PC3-PIP tumor-bearing mice to visualize infiltration of the Lu-177-labeled agent into the tumor. In preparation for a first-in-human study, human absorbed doses were estimated based on rat biodistribution out to 5 weeks to determine a safe CTT1403 therapy dose in humans.  Results:   Two to 3 injections of 14 MBq CTT1403 yielded significant tumor growth inhibition and increased survival compared with all control groups and mice receiving 1 injection of 14 MBq CTT1403. Five of 12 mice receiving 2 or 3 injections of CTT1403 survived to the 120-day post-treatment study endpoint. Dosimetry identified the kidneys as the dose-limiting organ, with an equivalent dose of 5.18 mSv/MBq, resulting in a planned maximum dose of 4.4 GBq for phase 1 clinical trials.

However, the clinical significance of specific lncRNAs in the context of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) and the molecular mechanisms by which they regulate this form of cancer remain largely unclear. In this study we found that the lncRNA PVT1 was upregulated in NPC, and that in patients this upregulation was associated with reduced survival. RNA sequencing revealed that PVT1 was responsible for regulating NPC cell proliferation and for controlling a hypoxia-related phenotype in these cells. PVT1 knockdown reduced NPC cell proliferation, colony formation, and tumorigenesis in a subcutaneous mouse xenograft model systems. We further found that PVT1 serves as a scaffold for the chromatin modification factor KAT2A, which mediates histone 3 lysine 9 acetylation (H3K9), recruiting the nuclear receptor binding protein TIF1β to activate NF90 transcription, thereby increasing HIF-1α stability and promoting a malignant phenotype in NPC cells. Overexpression of NF90 or HIF-1α restored the proliferation in cells that had ceased proliferating due to PVT1 or KAT2A depletion.

Atypically large extracellular vesicles (EVs), referred as ""Large Oncosomes"" (LO), have been identified in highly migratory and invasive PCa cells. We recently developed and characterized the DU145R80 subline, selected from parental DU145 cells as resistant to inhibitors of mevalonate pathway. DU145R80 showed different proteomic profile compared to parental DU145 cells, along with altered cytoskeleton dynamics and a more aggressive phenotype.  Methods:   Immunofluorescence staining and western blotting were used to identify blebbing and EVs protein cargo. EVs, purified by gradient ultra-centrifugations, were analyzed by tunable resistive pulse sensing and multi-parametric flow cytometry approach coupled with high-resolution imaging technologies. LO functional effects were tested in vitro by adhesion and invasion assays and in vivo xenograft model in nude mice. Xenograft and patient tumor tissues were analyzed by immunohistochemistry.  Results:   We found spontaneous blebbing and increased shedding of LO from DU145R80 compared to DU145 cells. LO from DU145R80, compared to those from DU145, carried increased amounts of key-molecules involved in PCa progression including integrin alpha V (αV-integrin). By incubating DU145 cells with DU145R80-derived LO we demonstrated that αV-integrin on LO surface was functionally involved in the increased adhesion and invasion of recipient cells, via AKT. Indeed either the pre-incubation of LO with an αV-integrin blocking antibody, or a specific AKT inhibition in recipient cells are able to revert the LO-induced functional effects. Moreover, DU145R80-derived LO also increased DU145 tumor engraftment in a mice model. Finally, we identified αV-integrin positive LO-like structures in tumor xenografts as well as in PCa patient tissues. Increased αV-integrin tumor expression correlated with high Gleason score and lymph node status.  Conclusions:   Overall, this study is the first to demonstrate the critical role of αV-integrin positive LO in PCa aggressive features, adding new insights in biological function of these large EVs and suggesting their potential use as PCa prognostic markers.""","""['Chiara Ciardiello', 'Alessandra Leone', 'Paola Lanuti', 'Maria S Roca', 'Tania Moccia', 'Valentina R Minciacchi', 'Michele Minopoli', 'Vincenzo Gigantino', 'Rossella De Cecio', 'Massimo Rippa', 'Lucia Petti', 'Francesca Capone', 'Carlo Vitagliano', 'Maria R Milone', 'Biagio Pucci', 'Rita Lombardi', 'Federica Iannelli', 'Elena Di Gennaro', 'Francesca Bruzzese', 'Marco Marchisio', 'Maria V Carriero', 'Dolores Di Vizio', 'Alfredo Budillon']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""J Exp Clin Cancer Res""","""['Proteomic analysis of zoledronic-acid resistant prostate cancer cells unveils novel pathways characterizing an invasive phenotype.', 'Integrin αv expression is required for the acquisition of a metastatic stem/progenitor cell phenotype in human prostate cancer.', 'Large oncosomes contain distinct protein cargo and represent a separate functional class of tumor-derived extracellular vesicles.', 'Large extracellular vesicles: Size matters in tumor progression.', 'αV integrins in angiogenesis and cancer.', 'Liquid Biopsy in Endometriosis: A Systematic Review.', 'Melanoma Cells Produce Large Vesicular-Bodies That Cause Rapid Disruption of Brain Endothelial Barrier-Integrity and Disassembly of Junctional Proteins.', 'Extracellular vesicles derived from mesenchymal stem cells - a novel therapeutic tool in infectious diseases.', 'Context-specific regulation of extracellular vesicle biogenesis and cargo selection.', 'Expression of urinary exosomal miRNA-615-3p and miRNA-3147 in diabetic kidney disease and their association with inflammation and fibrosis.']"""

Low-risk prostate cancer patients enrolled in active surveillance programs commonly undergo biopsies for examination of cancer progression. Biopsies are conducted as per a fixed and frequent schedule (e.g., annual biopsies). Since biopsies are burdensome, patients do not always comply with the schedule, which increases the risk of delayed detection of cancer progression. Objective. Our aim is to better balance the number of biopsies (burden) and the delay in detection of cancer progression (less is beneficial) by personalizing the decision of conducting biopsies. Data Sources. We used patient data of the world's largest active surveillance program (Prostate Cancer Research International Active Surveillance; PRIAS). It enrolled 5270 patients, had 866 cancer progressions, and an average of 9 prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and 5 digital rectal examination (DRE) measurements per patient. Methods. Using joint models for time-to-event and longitudinal data, we model the historical DRE and PSA measurements and biopsy results of a patient at each follow-up visit. This results in a visit and patient-specific cumulative risk of cancer progression. If this risk is above a certain threshold, we schedule a biopsy. We compare this personalized approach with the currently practiced biopsy schedules via an extensive and realistic simulation study, based on a replica of the patients from the PRIAS program. Results. The personalized approach saved a median of 6 biopsies (median: 4, interquartile range [IQR]: 2-5) compared with the annual schedule (median: 10, IQR: 3-10). However, the delay in detection of progression (years) is similar for the personalized (median: 0.7, IQR: 0.3-1.0) and the annual schedule (median: 0.5, IQR: 0.3-0.8). Conclusions. We conclude that personalized schedules provide substantially better balance in the number of biopsies per detected progression for men with low-risk prostate cancer.""","""['Anirudh Tomer', 'Dimitris Rizopoulos', 'Daan Nieboer', 'Frank-Jan Drost', 'Monique J Roobol', 'Ewout W Steyerberg']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Med Decis Making""","""['Personalised biopsy schedules based on risk of Gleason upgrading for patients with low-risk prostate cancer on active surveillance.', 'Personalized schedules for surveillance of low-risk prostate cancer patients.', 'Compliance Rates with the Prostate Cancer Research International Active Surveillance (PRIAS) Protocol and Disease Reclassification in Noncompliers.', 'Active Surveillance for Prostate Cancer: How to Do It Right.', 'Active surveillance for prostate cancer.', 'Joint models for dynamic prediction in localised prostate cancer: a literature review.', 'Shared decision making of burdensome surveillance tests using personalized schedules and their burden and benefit.', 'Cardiac Disease in Childhood Cancer Survivors: Risk Prediction, Prevention, and Surveillance: JACC CardioOncology State-of-the-Art Review.', 'Active surveillance for prostate cancer-will the discoveries of the last 5 years change the future?', 'Personalised biopsy schedules based on risk of Gleason upgrading for patients with low-risk prostate cancer on active surveillance.']"""

Methods:   This study had a prospective data collection and cross-sectional analysis. Between August and November 2017, a total of 70 patients who underwent multiparametric prostate magnetic resonance imaging due to clinical suspicion of prostatic neoplasia were recruited. The images obtained were evaluated by two independent readers regarding subjective/qualitative criteria (six criteria) and objective/quantitative criteria (three criteria), always comparing the monoexponential to biexponential acquisition protocols. The results were compared by statistical analysis (interobserver agreement - Gwet coefficient; analysis of the qualitative variables - Stuart-Maxwell test; and analysis of the quantitative variables - Wilcoxon test).  Results:   After exclusion of four patients, the final sample consisted of 66 patients. A good/excellent inter observer agreement was stablished for subjective criteria (except in one criteria). For the qualitative analysis the amount of good or excellent evaluations was higher for the monoexponential protocol (except in one category), with evidence of significant differences for three criteria (diffusion weighted imaging global quality; diffusion weighted imaging signal-to-noise ratio; and apparent diffusion coefficient signal-to-noise ratio). For the quantitative data analysis, the monoexponential protocol showed less variability of the anteroposterior diameters, meaning less distortion of the images, and better estimated signal-to-noise ratio.

In this work, we demonstrated that by surface coating of IMNs with red blood cell (RBC)-derived vesicles, the obtained biomimetic particles (RBC-IMNs) basically adsorb no biomolecules and maintain the CTC targeting ability when exposed to plasma. Compared to IMNs, RBC-IMNs exhibited an excellent cell isolation efficiency in spiked blood samples, which was improved to 95.71% from 60.22%.

This study aimed to assess the effect of LDA use on overall cancer incidence among the French population.  Methods:   We conducted a 10-year historical cohort study using the permanent sample of the French national health care databases: the Système National des Données de Santé (SNDS). We used data for 111 025 individuals aged 50 to 80 years at study entry (January 1, 2006) without prevalent cancer or LDA use. Individuals were followed until the earliest of cancer incidence, death from any cause, exit from the database, or end of the study on December 31, 2015. We estimated the effect of LDA on cancer incidence by using a dynamic model to account for the competing risk of death in the presence of time-dependent exposure and risk factors.  Results:   LDA use was associated with reduced 10-year risk of cancer (subdistribution hazard ratio [SHR] 0.81 [95% CI 0.77-0.86]). The SHRs were 0.88 [0.82-0.94] for men and 0.93 [0.85-1.02] for women. Moreover, each additional year of LDA use was associated with reduced 10-year risk of cancer (SHR 0.93 [0.92-0.95]).

Methods:   A total of 177 men with biochemical recurrence of prostate cancer suffering from bone metastases underwent PET/CT with [68Ga] Ga-PSMA-HBED-CC (68Ga-PSMA-11). To calculate 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET quantitative volumetric tumor parameters including whole-body total-lesion PSMA (TL-PSMA), whole-body PSMA-tumor volume (PSMA-TV), as well as the established maximum standard uptake values (SUVmax) and mean standard uptake values (SUVmean), all 443 68Ga-PSMA-11-positive bone lesions in the field of view were assessed quantitatively. Quantitative volumetric tumor parameters were correlated with CT-derived volume and bone density measurements of metastatic bone lesions, serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels, and Gleason Scores. In the 20 patients suffering from bone metastases who underwent 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT before and after therapy, CT-derived volume and bone density measurements of metastatic lesions were compared to biochemical response determined by serum-PSA levels.  Results:   In 177 patients, a total of 443 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET-positive bone lesions were detected. Of these, 50 lesions (11%) were only detectable on PET but not on conventional CT. PET-positive/CT-negative bone metastases demonstrated a significantly lower PSMA uptake compared to PET-positive/CT-positive bone lesions (p < 0.05). SUVmax, SUVmean, PSMA-TV, and TL-PSMA of bone metastases were significantly higher (p < 0.05) in patients with Gleason Scores > 7 compared to those with Gleason Scores ≤ 7. In the linear regression analysis, an association was determined between SUVmean, Gleason Scores, lesion classification, and serum-PSA levels but not for CT-derived bone density measurements. No significant correlation could be found between changes of bone density and CT-derived volume measurements of metastatic bone lesions and changes of serum-PSA levels (p > 0.05) before and after therapy, while a highly significant correlation was observed for changes of PSMA-TV, TL-PSMA, and serum-PSA levels (p < 0.001).  Conclusion:   Our results suggest that 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT might be a valuable tool for the detection and follow-up of bone metastases in patients with metastasized prostate cancer. 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET-derived quantitative volumetric parameters demonstrated a highly significant correlation with changes of serum-PSA levels during the course of therapy.

Methods:   Men living with and beyond prostate cancer were invited to participate in a 9-month non-randomised cluster controlled feasibility study.

Initial patient engagement with the sHNA was high, with all but one receiving practice nurse-led follow-up and an individualised care plan. The sHNA proved useful in identifying 'red flag' symptoms, and helping practice nurses decide when to seek further medical care for the patients. There was a high level of acceptability for patients and HCPs. However, integration of care did not occur as intended because of problems linking hospital and general practice IT systems.

This study aimed to find the role and mechanism of SPOCK2 in the development and progression of PCa.  Methods:   The messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) expression of SPOCK2 in PCa tissue was detected by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Upregulation of the SPOCK2 gene was achieved using the DU145 and LNCaP cells by transfecting the cells with SPOCK2 recombinant fragment. Cell invasion and migration ability were detected by transwell chamber and wound healing assay. The expression of membrane-type 1 matrix metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP) and matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP2) in the cells was detected by Western Blot and zymography gel assay.  Results:   The mRNA level of SPOCK2 was significantly lower in the PCa tissue compared to benign prostate hyperplasia.

This study aimed to provide age and organ-specific cancer risks according to gene and gender and to determine survival after cancer.  Methods:   We conducted an international, multicenter prospective observational study using independent test and validation cohorts of carriers of class 4 or class 5 variants. After validation the cohorts were merged providing 6350 participants and 51,646 follow-up years.  Results:   There were 1808 prospectively observed cancers. Pathogenic MLH1 and MSH2 variants caused high penetrance dominant cancer syndromes sharing similar colorectal, endometrial, and ovarian cancer risks, but older MSH2 carriers had higher risk of cancers of the upper urinary tract, upper gastrointestinal tract, brain, and particularly prostate. Pathogenic MSH6 variants caused a sex-limited trait with high endometrial cancer risk but only modestly increased colorectal cancer risk in both genders. We did not demonstrate a significantly increased cancer risk in carriers of pathogenic PMS2 variants. Ten-year crude survival was over 80% following colon, endometrial, or ovarian cancer.

Recently, studies have shown that expression of immune checkpoint proteins are directly or indirectly repressed by microRNAs (miRs) in many types of cancers. The great advantages of using miRs based therapy is the capacity of these short transcripts to target multiple molecules for the same- or different pathways with synergistic immune inhibition effects. miR-424 has previously been described as a biomarker of poor prognosis in different types of cancers. miR-424 is also found to target both the CTLA-4/CD80- and PD-1/PD-L1 axis. In the present study, the clinical significance of miR-424-3p expression in PC tissue was evaluated. Naïve radical prostatectomy specimens from 535 patients was used for tissue microarray construction. In situ hybridization was used to evaluate the expression of miR-424-3p and immunohistochemistry was used for CTLA-4 protein detection. In univariate- and multivariate analyses, low expression of miR-424-3p was significant associated with clinical failure-free survival, (p = 0.004) and p = 0.018 (HR:0.44, CI95% 0.22-0.87).

Extracapsular extension requires invasion within and through a smooth muscle-structured environment. Because integrins respond to biomechanical cues, we used a gene editing approach to determine if a specific region of laminin-binding α6β1 integrin was required for smooth muscle invasion both in vitro and in vivo. Human tissue specimens showed prostate cancer invasion through smooth muscle and tumor coexpression of α6 integrin and E-cadherin in a cell-cell location and α6 integrin in a cell-extracellular matrix (ECM) distribution. Prostate cancer cells expressing α6 integrin (DU145 α6WT) produced a 3D invasive network on laminin-containing Matrigel and invaded into smooth muscle both in vitro and in vivo. In contrast, cells without α6 integrin (DU145 α6KO) and cells expressing an integrin mutant (DU145 α6AA) did not produce invasive networks, could not invade muscle both in vitro and in vivo, and surprisingly formed 3D cohesive clusters. Using electric cell-substrate impedance testing, cohesive clusters had up to a 30-fold increase in normalized resistance at 400 Hz (cell-cell impedance) as compared with the DU145 α6WT cells. In contrast, measurements at 40,000 Hz (cell-ECM coverage) showed that DU145 α6AA cells were two-fold decreased in normalized resistance and were defective in restoring resistance after a 1 μmol/L S1P challenge as compared with the DU145 α6WT cells. The results suggest that gene editing of a specific α6 integrin extracellular region, not required for normal tissue function, can generate a new biophysical cancer phenotype unable to invade the muscle, presenting a new therapeutic strategy for metastasis prevention in prostate cancer.

A total of 31 proteins were associated with prostate cancer risk including proteins encoded by GSTP1, whose methylation level was shown previously to be associated with prostate cancer risk, and MSMB, SPINT2, IGF2R, and CTSS, which were previously implicated as potential target genes of prostate cancer risk variants identified in genome-wide association studies. A total of 18 proteins inversely correlated and 13 positively correlated with prostate cancer risk. For 28 of the identified proteins, gene somatic changes of short indels, splice site, nonsense, or missense mutations were detected in patients with prostate cancer in The Cancer Genome Atlas. Pathway enrichment analysis showed that relevant genes were significantly enriched in cancer-related pathways.

In this work, the feasibility of our recently proposed MRI-only workflow in clinically relevant scenarios is investigated and the necessary modifications in image acquisition and processing pipeline are proposed for transition to the clinic.  Methods and materials:   Four prostate phantoms with a total of 321 I-125 implanted dummy seeds and three patients with a total of 168 implanted seeds were scanned using a gradient echo sequence on 1.5 T and 3T MR scanners. Quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) was performed for seed visualization. Before QSM, the seed-induced distortion correction was performed followed by edge enhancement. Seed localization was performed using spatial clustering algorithms and was compared with CT. In addition, feasibility of the proposed method on detection of prostatic calcifications was studied.  Results:   The proposed susceptibility-based algorithm generated consistent positive contrast for the seeds in phantoms and patients. All the 321 seeds in the four phantoms were correctly identified; the MR-derived seeds centroids agreed well with CT-derived positions (average error = 0.5 ± 0.3 mm). The proposed algorithm for seed visualization was found to be orientation invariant. In patient cases, all seeds were visualized and correctly localized (average error = 1.2 ± 0.9 mm); no significant differences between dose volume histogram parameters were found. Prostatic calcifications were depicted with negative contrast on QSM and spatially agreed with CT.  Conclusions:   The proposed MRI-based approach has great potential to replace the current CT-based practices.

Moreover, correlation of cellularity metrics with mpMRI parameters was evaluated with Pearson's correlation coefficient (r).  Results:   In total, 398 lesions were identified, with 87.1% (196/225) index lesions and 86.8% (249/287) csPCa detected.

The use in oncology of positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) with emerging radiopharmaceuticals promises accurate staging of primary disease, restaging of recurrent disease and detection of metastatic lesions. Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) expression, directly related to androgen-independence, metastasis and progression, renders this tumour associate antigen a good target for the development of new radiopharmaceuticals for PET. Aim of this study was to demonstrate in a preclinical in vivo model (PSMA-positive versus PSMA-negative tumours) the targeting specificity and sensitivity of the anti-PSMA single-chain variable fragment (scFv) labelled with 124I.  Methods:   The 124I-labeling conditions of the antibody fragment scFvD2B were optimized and assessed for purity and immunoreactivity. The specificity of 124I-scFvD2B was tested in mice bearing PSMA-positive and PSMA-negative tumours to assess both ex-vivo biodistribution and immune-PET.  Results:   The uptake fraction of 124I-scFvD2B was very high on PSMA positive cells (range 75-91%) and highly specific and immuno-PET at the optimal time point, defined between 15 h and 24 h, provides a specific localization of lesions bearing the target antigen of interest (PSMA positive vs PSMA negative tumors %ID/g: p = 0.0198 and p = 0.0176 respectively) yielding a median target/background ratio around 30-40.  Conclusions:   Preclinical in vivo results of our immuno-PET reagent are highly promising. The target to background ratio is improved notably using PET compared to SPECT previously performed. These data suggest that, upon clinical confirmation of sensitivity and specificity, our anti-PSMA 124I-scFvD2B may be superior to other diagnostic modalities for PCa.

This study aimed to examine the clinical characteristics and postsurgical outcomes of patients with or without CKD and ESRD undergoing radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer.  Methods:   This population-based, retrospective study used patient data from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample, the largest all-payer US inpatient care database. From 2005 to 2014, 136,790 male patients aged > 20 years diagnosed with prostate cancer and who received radical prostatectomy were included. Postoperative complications, postoperative acute kidney injury (AKI) and urinary complications, and length of hospital stay were compared between patients with or without underlying CKD and ESRD.  Results:   After adjusting for relevant factors, the CKD group had a significantly higher risk of postoperative complications than the non-CKD group. In addition, the CKD group had a 5-times greater risk of postoperative AKI and urinary complications than the non-CKD group.

Materials and methods:   Using the National Inpatient Sample database from 2012 to 2013, we identified 99 070 patients with metastatic prostate cancer and analyzed the data from their hospital admissions using descriptive statistics, χ2 analysis, and regression modeling.  Results:   Palliative care services were consulted in 10.4% (10 300) of metastatic prostate cancer admissions. These admissions were associated with nonelective origin, acute complications, and reduced surgical procedures and chemotherapy. Patients in private, investor-owned hospitals had a 51.6% less consultations (P < .001), while nonprofit and government, nonfederal hospitals had 4.7% and 7.8% more consultations (P < .001). Median costs and charges were only marginally less (2.1% and 5.6%, respectively, P < .001), length of stay was 22% higher (P < .001), and in-house mortality was 147.2% higher in the consultation group (P < .001). Controlling for other factors, patients seen by palliative care were more likely to have do-not-resuscitate orders (odds ratio [OR]: 5.25, P < .001) and be transferred to another facility like hospice (OR: 3.90, P < .001) or to home health (OR: 3.85, P < .001).  Conclusions:   Palliative care consultation could improve care for patients with metastatic prostate cancer in a different manner than observed in other diseases.

Specific downregulation of TMBIM6 results in cancer cell death. However, the TMBIM6 gene transcriptional regulation in normal and cancer cells is least studied. Here, we identified the core promoter region (-133/+30 bp) sufficient for promoter activity of TMBIM6 gene. Reporter gene expression with mutations at transcription factor binding sites, EMSA, supershift, and ChIP assays demonstrated that Sp1 is an essential transcription factor for basal promoter activity of TMBIM6. The TMBIM6 mRNA expression was increased with Sp1 levels in a concentration dependent manner. Ablation of Sp1 through siRNA or inhibition with mithramycin-A reduced the TMBIM6 mRNA expression. We also found that the protein kinase-C activation stimulates promoter activity and endogenous TMBIM6 mRNA by 2- to 2.5-fold. Additionally, overexpression of active mutants of PKCι, PKCε, and PKCδ increased TMBIM6 expression by enhancing nuclear translocation of Sp1. Immunohistochemistry analyses confirmed that the expression levels of PKCι, Sp1, and TMBIM6 were correlated with one another in samples from human breast, prostate, and liver cancer patients. Altogether, this study suggests the involvement of Sp1 in basal transcription and PKC in the enhanced expression of TMBIM6 in cancer.""","""['Raghu Patil Junjappa', 'Hyun-Kyoung Kim', 'Seong Yeol Park', 'Kashi Raj Bhattarai', 'Kyung-Woon Kim', 'Jae-Won Soh', 'Hyung-Ryong Kim', 'Han-Jung Chae']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Cancers (Basel)""","""['Sp1/Sp3 and DNA-methylation contribute to basal transcriptional activation of human podoplanin in MG63 versus Saos-2 osteoblastic cells.', 'Transcriptional regulation of oncogenic protein kinase Cϵ (PKCϵ) by STAT1 and Sp1 proteins.', 'Characterization of the rat connexin40 promoter: two Sp1/Sp3 binding sites contribute to transcriptional activation.', 'Androgen receptor induces EPHA3 expression by interacting with transcription factor SP1.', 'Dual mechanisms of regulation of transcription of luteinizing hormone receptor gene by nuclear orphan receptors and histone deacetylase complexes.', 'Molecular features of androgen-receptor low, estrogen receptor-negative breast cancers in the Carolina breast cancer study.', 'Evaluation of predictive and prognostic value of androgen receptor expression in breast cancer subtypes treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy.', 'TMBIM6-mediated miR-181a expression regulates breast cancer cell migration and invasion via the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway.', 'STRIP2 motivates non-small cell lung cancer progression by modulating the TMBIM6 stability through IGF2BP3 dependent.', 'miR‑302d‑3p regulates the viability, migration and apoptosis of breast cancer cells through regulating the TMBIM6‑mediated ERK signaling pathway.']"""

The utility of relaxometry and ADC mapping for the transition zone (TZ) is unknown.PurposeTo evaluate the utility of MR fingerprinting combined with ADC mapping for characterizing TZ lesions.Materials and MethodsTZ lesions that were suspicious for cancer in men who underwent MRI with T2-weighted imaging and ADC mapping (b values, 50-1400 sec/mm2), MR fingerprinting with steady-state free precession, and targeted biopsy (60 in-gantry and 15 cognitive targeting) between September 2014 and August 2018 in a single university hospital were retrospectively analyzed. Two radiologists blinded to Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) scores and pathologic diagnosis drew regions of interest on cancer-suspicious lesions and contralateral visually normal TZs (NTZs) on MR fingerprinting and ADC maps. Linear mixed models compared two-reader means of T1, T2, and ADC. Generalized estimating equations logistic regression analysis was used to evaluate both MR fingerprinting and ADC in differentiating NTZ, cancers and noncancers, clinically significant (Gleason score ≥ 7) cancers from clinically insignificant lesions (noncancers and Gleason 6 cancers), and characterizing PI-RADS version 2 category 3 lesions.ResultsIn 67 men (mean age, 66 years ± 8 [standard deviation]) with 75 lesions, targeted biopsy revealed 37 cancers (six PI-RADS category 3 cancers and 31 PI-RADS category 4 or 5 cancers) and 38 noncancers (31 PI-RADS category 3 lesions and seven PI-RADS category 4 or 5 lesions). The T1, T2, and ADC of NTZ (1800 msec ± 150, 65 msec ± 22, and [1.13 ± 0.19] × 10-3 mm2/sec, respectively) were higher than those in cancers (1450 msec ± 110, 36 msec ± 11, and [0.57 ± 0.13] × 10-3 mm2/sec, respectively; P < .001 for all). The T1, T2, and ADC in cancers were lower than those in noncancers (1620 msec ± 120, 47 msec ± 16, and [0.82 ± 0.13] × 10-3 mm2/sec, respectively; P = .001 for T1 and ADC and P = .03 for T2). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) for T1 plus ADC was 0.94 for separation. T1 and ADC in clinically significant cancers (1440 msec ± 140 and [0.58 ± 0.14] × 10-3 mm2/sec, respectively) were lower than those in clinically insignificant lesions (1580 msec ± 120 and [0.75 ± 0.17] × 10-3 mm2/sec, respectively; P = .001 for all). The AUC for T1 plus ADC was 0.81 for separation. Within PI-RADS category 3 lesions, T1 and ADC of cancers (1430 msec ± 220 and [0.60 ± 0.17] × 10-3 mm2/sec, respectively) were lower than those of noncancers (1630 msec ± 120 and [0.81 ± 0.13] × 10-3 mm2/sec, respectively; P = .006 for T1 and P = .004 for ADC).

Materials and methods:   Biopsy naïve men due to undergo prostate biopsy for elevated prostate specific antigen and/or abnormal digital rectal examination underwent multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging, and transperineal template mapping and transrectal ultrasound guided systematic biopsies, which were performed and reported while blinded to other test results. Clinically significant prostate cancer was primarily defined as Gleason 4 + 3 or greater, or a maximum cancer core length of 6 mm or more of any grade. It was secondarily defined as Gleason 3 + 4 or greater, or a maximum cancer core length of 4 mm or more of any grade.  Results:   In 41 months 740 men were recruited at a total of 11 centers, of whom 576 underwent all 3 tests. Eight of the 150 men (5.1%) with a multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging score of 1-2 had any Gleason 3 + 4 or greater disease on transrectal ultrasound guided systematic biopsy. Of the 75 men in whom transrectal ultrasound guided systematic biopsy showed Gleason 3 + 3 of any maximum cancer core length 61 (81%) had Gleason 3 + 4, 8 (11%) had Gleason 4 + 3 and 0 (0%) had Gleason 4 + 5 or greater disease. For definition 1 (clinically significant prostate cancer) transrectal ultrasound guided systematic biopsy sensitivity remained stable and low across multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging Likert scores of 35% to 52%. For definition 2 (clinically significant prostate cancer and any cancer) sensitivity increased with higher multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging scores. The negative predictive value varied due to varying disease prevalence but for all cancer thresholds it declined with increasing multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging scores.  Conclusions:   In the setting of multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging Likert scores 1-2 transrectal ultrasound guided systematic biopsy revealed Gleason 3 + 4 disease in only 1 of 20 men. Further, for any clinically significant prostate cancer definition transrectal ultrasound guided systematic biopsy had poor sensitivity and variable but a low negative predictive value across multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging scores.

After an initial response to ADT, PCa cells can generate castration resistant (CRPC) or neuroendocrine (NEPC) malignancies, which are incurable. T-type calcium channels (TTCCs) are emerging as promising therapeutic targets for several cancers, but their role in PCa progression has never been investigated.  Methods:   To examine the role of TTCCs in PCa, we analyzed their expression level, copy number variants (CNV) and prognostic significance using clinical datasets (Oncomine and cBioPortal). We then evaluated TTCC expression in a panel of PCa cell lines and measured the effect of their inhibition on cell proliferation and survival using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) and caspase assays.  Results:   TTCCs were upregulated in PCas harboring androgen receptor (AR) mutations; CNV rate was positively associated with PCa progression. Higher expression of one TTCC isoform (CACNA1G) predicted poorer postoperative prognosis in early stage PCa samples. Pharmacological or small interfering RNA (siRNA)-based inhibition of TTCCs caused a decrease in PC-3 cell survival and proliferation.  Conclusions:   Our results show that TTCCs are overexpressed in advanced forms of PCa and correlate with a poorer prognosis. TTCC inhibition reduces cell proliferation and survival, suggesting that there may be possible value in the therapeutic targeting of TTCCs in advanced PCa.""","""['Roberto Silvestri', 'Perla Pucci', 'Erik Venalainen', 'Chrysanthi Matheou', 'Rebecca Mather', 'Stephen Chandler', 'Romina Aceto', 'Sushilaben H Rigas', 'Yuzhuo Wang', 'Katja Rietdorf', 'Martin David Bootman', 'Francesco Crea']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Estrogen induces androgen-repressed SOX4 expression to promote progression of prostate cancer cells.', 'Oxidative stress and androgen receptor signaling in the development and progression of castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'High Efficacy of Combination Therapy Using PI3K/AKT Inhibitors with Androgen Deprivation in Prostate Cancer Preclinical Models.', 'Interleukin-6 induces VEGF secretion from prostate cancer cells in a manner independent of androgen receptor activation.', 'The Hard-To-Close Window of T-Type Calcium Channels.', 'Calcium signalling pathways in prostate cancer initiation and progression.', 'Androgen receptor signaling-mitochondrial DNA-oxidative phosphorylation: A critical triangle in early prostate cancer.', 'Marine Natural Products with Activities against Prostate Cancer: Recent Discoveries.', 'The Role οf Ion Channels in the Development and Progression of Prostate Cancer.', ""From HDAC to Voltage-Gated Ion Channels: What's Next?

We studied whether repeated radiation treatment promotes androgen-independent survival of prostate cancer (PCa) cells and their metastatic potential. We also studied whether glucocorticoid receptor (GR) increase in radioresistant cells is associated with acquisition of these aggressive characteristics.  Methods:   Radioresistant LNCaP (LNCaPR18) and C4-2 (C4-2R26) PCa sublines were developed by repeated radiation treatments of parental cells. Levels and activations of androgen receptor (AR) and GR in radioresistant PCa cells and respective parental cells were investigated in quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction/Western blot analyses and immunofluorescence staining. Androgen-independent survival of radioresistant cells was tested in in vitro cell growth assays and the castration-resistant survival of these cell-derived tumors were investigated in mouse xenografts.  Results:   Higher GR levels, but lower AR levels were detected in radioresistant cells than in parental cells. Radiation-induced GR upregulation was associated with increased intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate. As a consequence of GR activation, LNCaPR18 cells survived well in an androgen-depleted culture condition while parental cells could not.

The growth of LNCaPR18 cell-derived tumors in castrated mice was impaired when treated with the anti-GR agent mifepristone. In experiments with C4-2/C4-2R26 cell sets, GR activation in C4-2R26 cells increased their metastatic potential.

In this study, we have searched for genetic susceptibility loci for potential cancer syndromes involving CRC combined with PrC and/or GC. We have performed SNP (single-nucleotide polymorphism)-based linkage analyses in 45 families with CRC, PrC, and GC. In the regions with suggested linkage, we performed exome and association haplotype analyses. Five loci generated a high logarithm of odds (HLOD) score >2, suggestive of linkage, in chromosome bands 1q31-32, 1q24-25, 6q25-26, 18p11-q11, and Xp11. Exome analysis detected no potential pathogenic sequence variants. The haplotype association study showed that one of the top five haplotypes with the lowest P value in the chromosome band 6q25 interestingly was found in the family which contributed the most to the increased HLOD at that locus.

But successful computer-based analysis requires careful tissue preparation and image acquisition to keep color and intensity variations to a minimum. While the human eye may recognize prostate glands with significant color and intensity variations, a computer algorithm may fail under such conditions. Since malignancy grading of prostate tissue according to Gleason or to the International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) grading system is based on architectural growth patterns of prostatic carcinoma, automatic methods must rely on accurate identification of the prostate glands. But due to poor color differentiation between stroma and epithelium from the common stain hematoxylin-eosin, no method is yet able to segment all types of glands, making automatic prognostication hard to attain. We address the effect of tissue preparation on glandular segmentation with an alternative stain, Picrosirius red-hematoxylin, which clearly delineates the stromal boundaries, and couple this stain with a color decomposition that removes intensity variation. In this paper we propose a segmentation algorithm that uses image analysis techniques based on mathematical morphology and that can successfully determine the glandular boundaries. Accurate determination of the stromal and glandular morphology enables the identification of the architectural pattern that determine the malignancy grade and classify each gland into its appropriate Gleason grade or ISUP Grade Group. Segmentation of prostate tissue with the new stain and decomposition method has been successfully tested on more than 11000 objects including well-formed glands (Gleason grade 3), cribriform and fine caliber glands (grade 4), and single cells (grade 5) glands.""","""['Christophe Avenel', 'Anna Tolf', 'Anca Dragomir', 'Ingrid B Carlbom']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Front Bioeng Biotechnol""","""['SOCS3 Immunohistochemical Expression Seems to Support the 2005 and 2014 International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) Modified Gleason Grading System.', 'The 2014 International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) Consensus Conference on Gleason Grading of Prostatic Carcinoma: Definition of Grading Patterns and Proposal for a New Grading System.', 'Usual and unusual histologic patterns of high Gleason score 8 to 10 adenocarcinoma of the prostate in needle biopsy tissue.', 'A hybrid deep learning approach for gland segmentation in prostate histopathological images.', 'Contemporary Gleason Grading of Prostatic Carcinoma: An Update With Discussion on Practical Issues to Implement the 2014 International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) Consensus Conference on Gleason Grading of Prostatic Carcinoma.', 'Zebrafish xenograft model for studying mechanism and treatment of non-small cell lung cancer brain metastasis.']"""

Methods:   Patients with T1-T4 N0 M0 prostate cancer who received radical EBRT between January 2002 and December 2015 were reviewed retrospectively. Clinical data were obtained via the institutional electronic medical records. The primary endpoint was 5-year overall survival (OS). The secondary endpoints were 5-year freedom from biochemical failure (FFBF) and treatment toxicities.  Results:   A total of 200 eligible patients were identified. Median follow-up duration was 48 months. 13%, 36% and 51% of patients had low-, intermediate- and high-risk disease. Median dose was 79.2 Gy. The 5-year OS were 90%, 87% and 78% and FFBF were 94%, 100% and 81% for low-, intermediate- and high-risk patients, respectively. Multivariable analysis showed that Eastern Cooperate Oncology Group performance status 2 and Gleason grade group 5 were independent predictors of worse OS.

It has been reported that microRNAs can serve as key regulators in tumor development and progression in various cancers including PCa. In this study, we examined the effect of miR-498 on proliferation, radiosensitivity, invasion, and migration of PCa cells. The proliferation of LNCaP and DU-145 PCa cells with altered expression of miR-498 was evaluated by MTT assay. The invasion and migration of LNCaP and DU-145 PCa cells were assess by matrigel invasion assay and transwell migration assay. The protein expression level in PCa cells was examined by western blot. The function of miR-498 on radiation-induced apoptosis in LNCaP and DU-145 PCa cells was detected by Caspase-Glo3/7 assay. Forced expression of miR-498 improved the proliferation, invasion and migration in PCa cells. Furthermore, miR-498 decreased the sensitivity of PCa cells after ionizing radiation treatment. MiR-498 reduced the radiation-induced apoptosis in PCa cells by regulation of BAX and Bcl-2 expression. Meanwhile, miR-498 altered the expression of E-cadherin, N-cadherin, snail, and Vimentin in both LNCaP and DU-145 PCa cells and regulated epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT). Further study showed that aberrant expression of miR-498 changed the expression levels of phosphatase and tensin homolog and p-AKT in LNCaP and DU-145 PCa cells. In a summary, miR-498 displayed important roles in tumor development and progression in PCa cells, and might act as a potential prognostic biomarker and predict radiotherapy response in PCa.""","""['Xiu-Mei Duan', 'Xiao-Na Liu', 'Yu-Xin Li', 'Yu-Qing Cao', 'Aidaeraili Silayiding', 'Rong-Kui Zhang', 'Ji-Ping Wang']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Kaohsiung J Med Sci""","""[""MicroRNA-483-3p Promotes Proliferation, Migration, and Invasion and Induces Chemoresistance of Wilms' Tumor Cells."", 'Tumor-promoting properties of miR-8084 in breast cancer through enhancing proliferation, suppressing apoptosis and inducing epithelial-mesenchymal transition.', 'The role of microRNA-572 in the proliferation and chemotherapeutic treatment of prostate cancer.', 'MiR-132 promotes the proliferation, invasion and migration of human pancreatic carcinoma by inhibition of the tumor suppressor gene PTEN.', 'The role of microRNAs in prostate cancer migration, invasion, and metastasis.', 'Identification of Radiation-Induced miRNA Biomarkers Using the CGL1 Cell Model System.', 'Knockdown of MIR9‑3HG inhibits proliferation and promotes apoptosis of cervical cancer cells by miR‑498 via EP300.', 'The Influence of miRNAs on Radiotherapy Treatment in Prostate Cancer - A Systematic Review.', 'MicroRNAs as Epigenetic Determinants of Treatment Response and Potential Therapeutic Targets in Prostate Cancer.', 'Small in Size, but Large in Action: microRNAs as Potential Modulators of PTEN in Breast and Lung Cancers.']"""

Materials and methods:   We conducted a 4-year historical prospective cohort study including 42,075 patients with cancer who purchased AD at least once during the study period. Adherence to AD was modeled as nonadherence (<20%), poor (20-50%), moderate (50-80%), and good (>80%) adherence. We conducted multivariable survival analyses adjusted for demographic and clinical variables that may affect mortality.  Results:   During 1,051,489 person-years at risk follow-up, the adjusted hazard ratios (HR) for mortality were 0.89 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.83-0.95), 0.77 (95% CI: 0.66-0.72), and 0.80 (95% CI: 0.76-0.85) for the poor, moderate, and good adherence groups, respectively, compared to the nonadherent group.

We assessed lesion agreement between PSMA-PET/MR and PSMA-PET/CT in patients undergoing initial evaluation of prostate cancer.  Methods:   This was a prospective study of consecutive patients with histological biopsy-proven prostate cancer who underwent pelvic PSMA-PET/MR followed by whole-body PSMA-PET/CT. All conspicuous PSMA-avid foci were counted on PSMA-PET/CT and PSMA-PET/MR with CT or MR correlation. Analysis was performed for intra-prostatic lesions, capsular invasion, seminal vesicle involvement and lymph node and bone involvement. Incidental and significant findings seen on PSMA-PET/CT outside the PSMA-PET/MR field of view were also analysed. Agreements between PSMA-PET/CT and PSMA-PET/MR findings were performed using Cohen's kappa test.  Results:   Image analysis was performed on 140 patients (mean age, 67.3 ± 8.2 years). Agreement between PSMA PET/CT and PSMA-PET/MR was very good for intra-prostatic PSMA-avid foci (K = 0.85) and pelvic lymph nodes (K = 0.98), good for PSMA-avid bone metastases (K = 0.76) and fair for prostatic capsular invasion (K = 0.25) and seminal vesicle involvement (K = 0.31). Twelve patients (8.5%) had incidental findings and two patients (1.4%) had clinically significant findings.  Conclusion:   Limited pelvic PSMA-PET/MR has very good agreement with PET/CT regarding PSMA-avid prostatic, regional lymph nodes and bone lesions, and is superior to PET/CT with regard to capsular invasion and seminal vesicle involvement.  Key points:   • Limited pelvic PSMA-PET/MR is superior to whole-body PSMA-PET/CT in detecting extensions of localised disease, mainly due to the high soft tissue resolution of MR. • Limited pelvic PSMA-PET/MR may be useful for initial evaluation of histological biopsy-proven prostate cancer. • Further studies are warranted to evaluate limited pelvic PSMA-PET/MR for screening and active surveillance in selected populations.""","""['Liran Domachevsky#', 'Hanna Bernstine#', 'Natalia Goldberg', 'Meital Nidam', 'Onofrio A Catalano', 'David Groshar']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Eur Radiol""","""['More advantages in detecting bone and soft tissue metastases from prostate cancer using 18F-PSMA PET/CT.', 'Histological comparison between predictive value of preoperative 3-T multiparametric MRI and 68 Ga-PSMA PET/CT scan for pathological outcomes at radical prostatectomy and pelvic lymph node dissection for prostate cancer.', '68Ga-Labeled Prostate-specific Membrane Antigen Ligand Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography for Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.', 'The role of prostate-specific membrane antigen PET/computed tomography in primary staging of prostate cancer.', 'Use of gallium-68 prostate-specific membrane antigen positron-emission tomography for detecting lymph node metastases in primary and recurrent prostate cancer and location of recurrence after radical prostatectomy: an overview of the current literature.', 'A Systematic Review of the Variability in Performing and Reporting Intraprostatic Prostate-specific Membrane Antigen Positron Emission Tomography in Primary Staging Studies.', 'The role of 18F-DCFPyL PET/MRI radiomics for pathological grade group prediction in prostate cancer.', 'Simultaneous multislice diffusion-weighted imaging versus standard diffusion-weighted imaging in whole-body PET/MRI.', 'Review of imaging techniques for evaluating morphological and functional responses to the treatment of bone metastases in prostate and breast cancer.', 'Prostate and dominant intraprostatic lesion segmentation on PET/CT using cascaded regional-net.']"""

PSMA is also overexpressed in the neovasculature of other tumours including renal cell carcinoma (RCC), suggesting there may be a role for the use of 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT. Thus far, there has been limited literature documenting the use of 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT in the investigation and management decisions of RCC.  Methods:   This was a retrospective case series of patients who received a 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT scan for staging or restaging of RCC between July 2016 and December 2018. Primary outcome measure was to identify whether 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT changed management compared to standard diagnostic CT imaging. Analysis was based on four categories: (1) identification of new disease, (2) refuting disease on CT imaging, (3) identification of synchronous primaries, and (4) concordance with CT imaging.  Results:   38 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT scans met inclusion criteria. Primary staging scans were performed in 16 patients, of which 75% showed avid primary lesions, with the majority of clear cell subtype. Management was changed in 43.8% of patients. CT agreed with 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT in 37.5% of cases. Restaging scans were performed in 22 patients. 40.9% of patients had management changed by results of 68Ga- PSMA PET/CT. CT agreed with 68Ga- PSMA PET/CT in 36.4% of cases. Management was predominantly changed due to the identification of new sites of suspected metastases, as well as the detection of synchronous primaries.  Conclusions: 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT directly changed management in 42.1% of cases. Strongest detection rates occurred in those patients with clear cell RCC. The results of this study suggest there may be merit in the use of the modality in the staging of RCC. Further analysis, both with respect to histological confirmation, efficacy and cost-benefit, is required to determine whether there is a role for routine 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT imaging.""","""['Sheliyan Raveenthiran', 'Rachel Esler', 'John Yaxley', 'Sam Kyle']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Eur J Nucl Med Mol Imaging""","""['More advantages in detecting bone and soft tissue metastases from prostate cancer using 18F-PSMA PET/CT.', '68Ga-Labeled Prostate-specific Membrane Antigen Ligand Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography for Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.', 'Utility of 68 Ga prostate specific membrane antigen - positron emission tomography in diagnosis and response assessment of recurrent renal cell carcinoma.', 'Incidental Detection of Thyroid Metastases From Renal Cell Carcinoma Using 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT to Assess Prostate Cancer Recurrence.', 'Role of PSMA-ligands imaging in Renal Cell Carcinoma management: current status and future perspectives.', 'Feasibility of biology-guided radiotherapy for metastatic renal cell carcinoma driven by PSMA PET imaging.', 'The Emerging Role of PET/CT with PSMA-Targeting Radiopharmaceuticals in Clear Cell Renal Cancer: An Updated Systematic Review.', 'Head-to-head comparison of 68GaGa-P16-093 and 2-18FFDG PET/CT in patients with clear cell renal cell carcinoma: a pilot study.', 'Impact of Prostate-specific Membrane Antigen Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography in the Management of Oligometastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma.', 'PSMA Radioligand Uptake as a Biomarker of Neoangiogenesis in Solid Tumours: Diagnostic or Theragnostic Factor?']"""

Through multivariate Cox regression analysis, time to surgical resection (≤30 days vs. >30 days) did not affect lung cancer-specific survival (hazard ratio 0.999; 0.739-1.350; P = 0.994). When the same multivariate analysis was repeated using time to surgical resection as a continuous variable, there was no impact on lung cancer-specific survival (hazard ratio 1.002; 0.997-1.007; P = 0.383).  Conclusions:   Time to surgical resection did not affect survival outcomes of non-metastatic NSCLC patients.

The UniCAR system is composed of (i) target modules (TMs) and (ii) UniCAR armed T cells. TMs are bispecific molecules that are able to bind to the tumor cell surface and simultaneously to UniCAR T cells. For interaction with UniCAR T cells, TMs contain a peptide epitope sequence which is recognised by UniCAR T cells. So far, a series of TMs against a variety of tumor targets including against the prostate stem cell antigen (PSCA) were constructed and functionally characterised. In order to facilitate their purification all these TMs are expressed as recombinant proteins equipped with an oligo-His-tag. The aim of the here presented manuscript was to learn whether or not the oligo-His-tag of the TM influences the UniCAR system. For this purpose, we constructed TMs against PSCA equipped with or lacking an oligo-His-tag. Both TMs were compared side by side including for functionality and biodistribution. According to our data, an oligo-His-tag of a UniCAR TM has only little if any effect on its binding affinity, in vitro and in vivo killing capability and in vivo biodistribution.""","""['Justyna Jureczek', 'Ralf Bergmann', 'Nicole Berndt', 'Stefanie Koristka', 'Alexandra Kegler', 'Edinson Puentes-Cala', 'Javier Andrés Soto', 'Claudia Arndt', 'Michael Bachmann', 'Anja Feldmann']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Sci Rep""","""['Retargeting of T lymphocytes to PSCA- or PSMA positive prostate cancer cells using the novel modular chimeric antigen receptor platform technology ""UniCAR"".', 'Simultaneous targeting of prostate stem cell antigen and prostate-specific membrane antigen improves the killing of prostate cancer cells using a novel modular T cell-retargeting system.', 'Extended half-life target module for sustainable UniCAR T-cell treatment of STn-expressing cancers.', 'The UniCAR system: A modular CAR T cell approach to improve the safety of CAR T cells.', 'Conventional CARs versus modular CARs.', 'Specific and safe targeting of glioblastoma using switchable and logic-gated RevCAR T cells.', 'Influence of Culture Conditions on Ex Vivo Expansion of T Lymphocytes and Their Function for Therapy: Current Insights and Open Questions.', 'A Small Step, a Giant Leap: Somatic Hypermutation of a Single Amino Acid Leads to Anti-La Autoreactivity.', 'Novel Redirected T-Cell Immunotherapies for Advanced Prostate Cancer.', 'And Yet It Moves: Oxidation of the Nuclear Autoantigen La/SS-B Is the Driving Force for Nucleo-Cytoplasmic Shuttling.']"""

We aimed to examine the association between AZGP1 expression and the endpoints: risk of biochemical failure (BF), initiating castration-based treatment, developing castration-resistant PCa (CRPC) and PCa-specific mortality following radical prostatectomy (RP).  Methods:   The study included a prospective cohort of 302 patients who underwent RP for PCa from 2002 to 2005. AZGP1 expression was analysed using immunohistochemistry on tissue microarray RP specimens and was scored semiquantitively as low or high expression. Risk of all endpoints was analysed using stratified cumulative incidences and cause-specific Cox regression, and validated with receiver operating curves, calibration and discrimination in competing-risk analyses. A meta-analysis was performed including previous studies investigating AZGP1 expression and risk of BF following RP.  Results:   Median time of follow-up was 14.0 years. The cumulative incidence of all endpoints was significantly higher in patients with low AZGP1 expression compared with patients with high AZGP1 expression (p<0.001). In a multivariate analysis, low AZGP1 expression increases the risk of BF (HR 2.7; 95% CI 1.9 to 3.8; p<0.0001), castration-based treatment (HR 2.2; 95% CI 1.2 to 4.2; p=0.01) and CRPC (HR 2.3; 95% CI 1.1 to 5.0; p=0.03). Validation showed a low risk of prediction error and a high model performance for all endpoints. In a meta-analysis, low AZGP1 was associated with BF (HR 1.7; 95% CI 1.2 to 2.5).

Materials and methods:   We retrospectively evaluated 44 patients with CRPC who underwent palliative transurethral resection of the prostate. Genomic DNA was extracted from formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded material, and 1245A>C SNP of the HSD3B1 gene was analyzed via Sanger sequencing. Cox regression analysis was used to assess the prognostic value of the respective SNP with time to progression as well as cancer-specific and overall survival in the subgroup of patients receiving second systemic treatment.  Results:   The SNP was present in 20 patients (51.2%) who received second line systemic treatment additionally to androgen deprivation, of which 16 (80%) patients were heterozygous and 4 (20%) were homozygous. Correlation analysis revealed no association of the SNP with any clinical characteristics at initiation of second-line systemic treatment. Moreover, the presence of the variant (1245A>C) of HSD3B1 was not associated with any survival endpoint.  Conclusions:   The variant allele 1245C of the HSD3B1 gene is present in approximately one-half of patients with CRPC; however, it is not associated with oncologic outcomes.

Material and method:   Twenty-eight men (mean age, 69±6 [SD] years; range: 51-82 years) treated with cryoablation for prostatic (N=21) or extraprostatic (N=7) recurrent prostate cancer after radiotherapy with or without associated prostatectomy were included. Technical success, complication and recurrences were reported. Biological recurrence was defined as an elevation ≥2ng/mL of prostate specific antigen (PSA) serum level after the treatment.  Results:   The mean follow-up was 18 months. Among the 21 patients with intraprostatic recurrence, 14 had successful cryotherapy with a mean decrease in serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels of -5.7±2.6 (SD) ng/mL (range: -2.1 to -16.9ng/mL). Four patients (19%) had early progression and three patients (14%) had delayed biological recurrence (mean time: 15 months). Among the 7 patients with extraprostatic recurrence, 2/7 (291%) had successful cryotherapy with a decrease in PSA serum level of -2.7±1.6 (SD) ng/mL (range: -0.5--5.5ng/mL) and 4/7 (57%) had early biological recurrence after cryotherapy that required androgen deprivation therapy, whereas 1/7 (4%) was lost to follow-up.

Objective:   To compare outcome and toxicity between both treatments. Primary endpoint was metastasis-free survival, adjusted for selected variables (aMFS).  Design, setting, and participants:   This was a multi-institutional, retrospective analysis of 506 (SBRT: 309, ENRT: 197) patients with hormone-sensitive nodal oligorecurrent PC (five or fewer lymph nodes (LNs; N1/M1a), treated between 2004 and 2017. Median follow-up was 36 mo (interquartile range 23-56).  Intervention:   SBRT was defined as a minimum of 5 Gy per fraction to each lesion with a maximum of 10 fractions. ENRT was defined as a minimum dose of 45 Gy in up to 25 fractions to the elective nodes, with or without a simultaneous boost to the suspicious node(s). The choice of radiotherapy (RT) was at the discretion of the treating physician, with treatments being unbalanced over the centers.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   In total, 506 patients from 15 different treatment centers were included. Primary treatment was radical prostatectomy, RT, or their combination. Nodal recurrences were detected by positron emission tomography/computer tomography (97%) or conventional imaging (3%). Descriptive statistics was used to summarize patient characteristics.  Results and limitations:   ENRT was associated with fewer nodal recurrences compared with SBRT (p < 0.001). In a multivariable analysis, patients with one LN at recurrence had longer aMFS after ENRT (hazard ratio: 0.50, 95% confidence interval 0.30-0.85, p = 0.009). Late toxicity was higher after ENRT compared with that after SBRT (16% vs. 5%, p < 0.01). Limitations include higher use of hormone therapy in the ENRT cohort and nonstandardized follow-up.  Conclusions:   ENRT reduces the number of nodal recurrences as compared with SBRT, however at higher toxicity. Our findings hypothesize that ENRT should be preferred to SBRT in the treatment of nodal oligorecurrences. This hypothesis needs to be evaluated in a randomized trial.  Patient summary:   This study investigated the difference between stereotactic and elective nodal radiotherapy in treating limited nodal metastatic prostate cancer. Nodal relapse was less frequent following elective nodal radiotherapy than following stereotactic body radiotherapy, and thus elective nodal radiotherapy might be the preferred treatment.""","""['Elise De Bleser', 'Barbara Alicja Jereczek-Fossa', 'David Pasquier', 'Thomas Zilli', 'Nicholas Van As', 'Shankar Siva', 'Andrei Fodor', 'Piet Dirix', 'Alfonso Gomez-Iturriaga', 'Fabio Trippa', 'Beatrice Detti', 'Gianluca Ingrosso', 'Luca Triggiani', 'Alessio Bruni', 'Filippo Alongi', 'Dries Reynders', 'Gert De Meerleer', 'Alessia Surgo', 'Kaoutar Loukili', 'Raymond Miralbell', 'Pedro Silva', 'Sarat Chander', 'Nadia Gisella Di Muzio', 'Ernesto Maranzano', 'Giulio Francolini', 'Andrea Lancia', 'Alison Tree', 'Chiara Lucrezia Deantoni', 'Elisabetta Ponti', 'Giulia Marvaso', 'Els Goetghebeur', 'Piet Ost']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Eur Urol""","""['Salvage Radiotherapy for Nodal Oligorecurrent Prostate Cancer: A Step Towards Predictive Criteria for Metastasis-Directed Therapy in Prostate Cancer?', 'Re: Elise De Bleser, Barbara Alicja Jereczek-Fossa, David Pasquier, et al.

The intracellular domain of CD44 (CD44-ICD) has been implicated as a co-transcription factor for RUNX2 in the regulation of expression of MMP-9 in breast carcinoma cells. Previous studies from our laboratory demonstrated the role of CD44 in migration and invasion of PC3 prostate cells through activation of MMP-9. CD44 signaling regulates the phosphorylation and hence the localization of RUNX2 in the nucleus. The role of CD44-ICD has not been studied in prostate cancer cells. This study aimed to explore the role of CD44-ICD and RUNX2 in the regulation of expression of metastasis-related genes.  Methods:   PC3 and PC3 cells overexpressing RUNX2 protein were analyzed for RUNX2/CD44-ICD interaction by immunoprecipitation, immunoblotting, and Immunofluorescence analyses. Wound healing and tumorsphere formation analyses were also done in these cells. The real-time PCR analysis was used to detect the expression levels of different genes.  Results:   Expression of CD44 and RUNX2 was observed only in PC3 cells (androgen receptor positive) and not in LNCaP or PCa2b cells (androgen receptor negative). Therefore, CD44-ICD fragment (~ 15-16 kDa) was observed in PC3 cells. Moreover, localization of CD44-ICD was more in the nucleus than in the cytoplasm of PC3 cells. Inhibition of cleavage of CD44 with a γ-secretase inhibitor, DAPT reduced the formation of CD44-ICD; however, accumulation of CD44-external truncation fragments (~ 20 and ~ 25 kDa) was detected. RUNX2 and CD44-ICD interact in the nucleus of PC3 cells, and this interaction was more in PC3 cells transfected with RUNX2 cDNA. Overexpression of RUNX2 augments the expression of metastasis-related genes (e.g., MMP-9 and osteopontin) which resulted in increased migration and tumorsphere formation.  Conclusions:   We have shown here a strong functional relationship between CD44-ICD and RUNX2 in PC3 cells. RUNX2 forms a complex with CD44-ICD as a co-transcriptional factor, and this complex formation not only activates the expression of metastasis-related genes but also contributes to migration and tumorsphere formation. Therefore, RUNX2 and CD44-ICD are potential targets for anti-cancer therapy, and attenuation of their interaction may validate the regulatory effects of these proteins on cancer migration and progression.""","""['Linda T Senbanjo', 'Hanan AlJohani', 'Sunipa Majumdar', 'Meenakshi A Chellaiah']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Cell Commun Signal""","""['Integrin αvβ3 and CD44 pathways in metastatic prostate cancer cells support osteoclastogenesis via a Runx2/Smad 5/receptor activator of NF-κB ligand signaling axis.', 'Mechanisms of osteopontin and CD44 as metastatic principles in prostate cancer cells.', 'Identification of sequence-specific interactions of the CD44-intracellular domain with RUNX2 in the transcription of matrix metalloprotease-9 in human prostate cancer cells.', 'Mechanism and biological significance of CD44 cleavage.', 'Regulatory roles of Runx2 in metastatic tumor and cancer cell interactions with bone.', 'Evaluation of CD44 Expression in Prostatic Adenocarcinoma: An Institutional Study.', 'CD51 Intracellular Domain Promotes Cancer Cell Neurotropism through Interacting with Transcription Factor NR4A3 in Colorectal Cancer.', 'Role of RUNX2 in breast cancer development and drug resistance (Review).', 'Recent progress in molecular mechanisms of postoperative recurrence and metastasis of hepatocellular carcinoma.', 'Genetic heterogeneity of liver cancer stem cells.']"""

An RGO FET biosensor modified with specific antibody CD63 in the sensing area was fabricated and was used for electrical and label-free quantification of exosomes. The method achieved a low limit of detection down to 33 particles/μL, which is lower than that of many other available methods. In addition, the FET biosensor was employed to detect exosomes in clinical serum samples, showing significant differences in detecting healthy people and prostate cancer (PCa) patients.

Results:   For each site, excess mortality rates reduced over time, especially for prostate cancer. While both the 10-year net and crude probability of cancer deaths decreased over time, specific patterns varied. For example, the crude probability of lung cancer deaths for males aged 50 years decreased from 0.90 (1984) to 0.79 (2013); whereas the corresponding probabilities for kidney cancer were 0.64 and 0.18 respectively. Patterns for crude probabilities of competing deaths were relatively constant. Although for younger patients, both net and crude measures were similar, crude probability of competing deaths increased with age, hence for older ages net and crude measures were different except for lung and pancreas cancers.  Conclusions:   The observed reductions in probabilities of death over three decades for Australian cancer patients are encouraging.

Asian patients are at increased risk of febrile neutropenia. Although primary prophylaxis with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor can reduce the incidence, its efficacy has not been prospectively demonstrated in Japanese patients with cabazitaxel treatment.  Methods:   PEGAZUS, a prospective, single-arm study conducted at eight clinical sites in Japan, enrolled 21 heavily pretreated patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. Patients received cabazitaxel 25 mg/m2 every 3 weeks, up to 10 cycles. Oral prednisolone 10 mg was taken daily. Pegfilgrastim 3.6 mg was administered at least 24 h after the cabazitaxel infusion. The primary endpoint was the incidence of febrile neutropenia in the first cycle.  Results:   The median number of treatment cycles was seven. The relative dose intensity of cabazitaxel was 67.4% (range, 53.2-91.3%). Two of 21 patients (9.5%) experienced febrile neutropenia in the first cycle. This rate was lower than the rate (43%) previously observed without prophylactic granulocyte colony-stimulating factor in a similar patient population. Six patients showed a prostate-specific antigen response (28.6%). Three of four patients evaluable for tumor response had stable disease and one had progressive disease. Grade ≥3 diarrhea was not observed. Primary prophylaxis with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor significantly reduced the incidence of febrile neutropenia in this study.

We evaluated the efficacy and safety of enzalutamide in metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (mHSPC).  Methods:   ARCHES (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02677896) is a multinational, double-blind, phase III trial, wherein 1,150 men with mHSPC were randomly assigned 1:1 to enzalutamide (160 mg/day) or placebo, plus androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), stratified by disease volume and prior docetaxel chemotherapy. The primary end point was radiographic progression-free survival.  Results:   As of October 14, 2018, the risk of radiographic progression or death was significantly reduced with enzalutamide plus ADT versus placebo plus ADT (hazard ratio, 0.39; 95% CI, 0.30 to 0.50; P < .001; median not reached v 19.0 months). Similar significant improvements in radiographic progression-free survival were reported in prespecified subgroups on the basis of disease volume and prior docetaxel therapy. Enzalutamide plus ADT significantly reduced the risk of prostate-specific antigen progression, initiation of new antineoplastic therapy, first symptomatic skeletal event, castration resistance, and reduced risk of pain progression. More men achieved an undetectable prostate-specific antigen level and/or an objective response with enzalutamide plus ADT (P < .001). Patients in both treatment groups reported a high baseline level of quality of life, which was maintained over time. Grade 3 or greater adverse events were reported in 24.3% of patients who received enzalutamide plus ADT versus 25.6% of patients who received placebo plus ADT, with no unexpected adverse events.  Conclusion:   Enzalutamide with ADT significantly reduced the risk of metastatic progression or death over time versus placebo plus ADT in men with mHSPC, including those with low-volume disease and/or prior docetaxel, with a safety analysis that seems consistent with the safety profile of enzalutamide in previous clinical trials in castration-resistant prostate cancer.""","""['Andrew J Armstrong', 'Russell Z Szmulewitz', 'Daniel P Petrylak', 'Jeffrey Holzbeierlein', 'Arnauld Villers', 'Arun Azad', 'Antonio Alcaraz', 'Boris Alekseev', 'Taro Iguchi', 'Neal D Shore', 'Brad Rosbrook', 'Jennifer Sugg', 'Benoit Baron', 'Lucy Chen', 'Arnulf Stenzl']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""J Clin Oncol""","""['Progress in the Systemic Management of Advanced Prostate Cancer: The Hormone-Sensitive Paradigm.', 'Effect of Enzalutamide plus Androgen Deprivation Therapy on Health-related Quality of Life in Patients with Metastatic Hormone-sensitive Prostate Cancer: An Analysis of the ARCHES Randomised, Placebo-controlled, Phase 3 Study.', 'Improved Survival With Enzalutamide in Patients With Metastatic Hormone-Sensitive Prostate Cancer.', 'Efficacy of enzalutamide in subgroups of men with metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer based on prior therapy, disease volume, and risk.', 'Adding abiraterone to androgen deprivation therapy in men with metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer: A\xa0systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Enzalutamide for the treatment of nonmetastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Bipolar Androgen Therapy: When Excess Fuel Extinguishes the Fire.', 'Methods for Evaluating the Efficacy of Medical Castration: A Systematic Review.', 'Androgen deprivation therapy plus abiraterone or docetaxel as neoadjuvant therapy for very-high-risk prostate cancer: a pooled analysis of two phase II trials.', 'TRIM11 Posttranscriptionally Modulated by miR-5193 Facilitates Tumor Growth and Metastasis of Prostate Cancer.', 'Effectiveness of electronic patient reporting outcomes, by a digital telemonitoring platform, for prostate cancer care: the Protecty study.']"""

Methods:   A novel diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP)-based fluorescent zinc ion probe named DPP-C2 was prepared. The fluorescent intensity of this novel molecule is in direct proportion to environmental zinc concentration. Malignant (DU145 and PC3 cells) and normal prostate epithelial RWPE-1 cells were tested. Prostate cancer tissues were also cultured and observed as tissue sections. The probe was also intravenously administered to tumor-bearing (DU145 and PC3 cells) nude mice and observed under a whole-body fluorescence live-imaging system.  Results:   The probe showed minimal cytotoxicity to malignant and normal prostate cells. The RWPE-1 cells showed not only stronger baseline fluorescence but also a significant increase in signal intensity after culturing in a zinc-supplemented medium. In human prostate sections, the pathologically confirmed cancer tissues exhibited weaker fluorescence signals than normal and benign hyperplastic tissues. With proper excitation, prostate tissues revealed more intense fluorescence signals than tumor tissues, whereas other surrounding tissues showed almost no fluorescence.

The uptake and mechanism of action of 223Ra-Dichloride is not well understood. The aim of this work was to develop a compartmental model for 223Ra-Dichloride in patients to improve understanding of the underlying mechanisms.  Methods and materials:   A compartmental model was developed based on activity retention data from 6 patients (2 treatments of 110 kBq/kg 223Ra-Dichloride) for plasma, bone surfaces, small intestines, large intestines, and excretion data. Rate constants were extracted. Rate constant variability between patients and treatments was assessed. A population model was proposed and compared with the established International Commission on Radiological Protection-67 compartmental model.  Results:   A single bone compartment cannot accurately describe activity retention in the skeleton. The addition of a second bone compartment improved the fit to skeleton retention data, and the Akaike information criterion decreased. Mean rate constants of 4.0 (range, 1.9-10.9) and 0.15 (0.07-0.39) h-1 were obtained for transport from plasma to first bone compartment and vice versa. Rate constants from first to second bone compartment and back of 0.03 (0.02-0.06) and 0.008 (0.003-0.011) h-1 were calculated. Rate constants for individual patients showed no significant difference between patients and treatments.  Conclusions:   The developed compartmental model suggests that 223Ra-Dichloride initially locates at the bone surface and is then incorporated into the bone matrix relatively quickly. This observation could have implications for dosimetry and understanding of the effects of alpha radiation on normal bone tissue. Results suggest that a population model based on patient measurements is feasible.""","""['Jan Taprogge', 'Iain Murray', 'Jonathan Gear', 'Sarah J Chittenden', 'Christopher C Parker', 'Glenn D Flux']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys""","""['Whole-Body and Microenvironmental Localization of Radium-223 in Naïve and Mouse Models of Prostate Cancer Metastasis.', 'Excretion and whole-body retention of radium-223 dichloride administered for the treatment of bone metastases from castration resistant prostate cancer.', 'Dosimetry of bone metastases in targeted radionuclide therapy with alpha-emitting (223)Ra-dichloride.', 'Radium-223 in the treatment of osteoblastic metastases: a critical clinical review.', 'Radium 223 dichloride for prostate cancer treatment.', 'Alpha-Emitter Radiopharmaceuticals and External Beam Radiotherapy: A Radiobiological Model for the Combined Treatment.', 'Imaging and dosimetry for alpha-particle emitter radiopharmaceutical therapy: improving radiopharmaceutical therapy by looking into the black box.', 'Radioimmunotherapy for Brain Metastases: The Potential for Inflammation as a Target of Choice.', 'The role of dosimetry and biological effects in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) patients treated with 223Ra: first in human study.', 'Radiopharmacokinetic modelling and radiation dose assessment of 223Ra used for treatment of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.']"""

Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) play a major role in the suppression of antitumor immunity and STAT3 is involved in the accumulation, generation, and function of MDSCs. Thus, targeting STAT3 holds the potential of reversing immunosuppression in cancer. This study aims to investigate the effect of the small molecule STAT3 inhibitor galiellalactone on prostate cancer cell- induced generation of MDSCs from monocytes and the effect on immunosuppressive factors and inflammatory cytokines.  Methods:   Primary human monocytes were cocultured with prostate cancer cells (DU145, PC3, and LNCaP-IL6) or with conditioned medium (CM) from prostate cancer cells in the presence or absence of the STAT3 inhibitor galiellalactone. Monocytes were analyzed by flow cytometry for an MDSC-like phenotype (CD14+ HLA-DR-/lo ). The secretion and gene expression of immunosuppressive factors and inflammatory cytokines from prostate cancer cells and monocytes were investigated.  Results:   Galiellalactone blocked the prostate cancer cell-induced generation of MDSC-like monocytes with an immunosuppressive phenotype ex vivo. Monocytes cultured with CM from prostate cancer cells showed increased expression of phosphorylated STAT3. Prostate cancer cells increased the expression of interleukin1β (IL1β), IL10, and IL6 in monocytes which was inhibited by galiellalactone. In addition, galiellalactone decreased indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase gene expression in monocytes. Galiellalactone reduced the levels of IL8 and granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor in prostate cancer cells per se.  Conclusion:   The STAT3 inhibitor galiellalactone may prevent the prostate cancer cell-induced generation of MDSCs and reverse the immunosuppressive mechanisms caused by the interplay between prostate cancer cells and MDSCs.

To further improve the prediction lymph node invasion in prostate cancer, we adopted risk scores of the genes expression based on the nomogram in guidelines.  Methods:   We analyzed clinical data from 320 PCa patients from the Cancer Genome Atlas database. Weighted gene coexpression network analysis was used to identify the genes that were significantly associated with LNI in PCa (n = 390). Analyses using the Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes databases were performed to identify the activated signaling pathways. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to identify the independent risk factors for the presence of LNI.  Results:   We found that patients with actual LNI and predicted LNI had the worst survival outcomes. The 7 most significant genes (CTNNAL1, ENSA, MAP6D1, MBD4, PRCC, SF3B2, TREML1) were selected for further analysis. Pathways in the cell cycle, DNA replication, oocyte meiosis, and 9 other pathways were dramatically activated during LNI in PCa. Multivariate analyses identified that the risk score (odds ratio [OR] = 1.05 for 1% increase, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.04-1.07, P < .001), serum PSA level, clinical stage, primary biopsy Gleason grade (OR = 2.52 for a grade increase, 95% CI: 1.27-5.22, P = .096), and secondary biopsy Gleason grade were independent predictors of LNI. A nomogram built using these predictive variables showed good calibration and a net clinical benefit, with an area under the curve (AUC) value of 90.2%.

To compare continence outcomes between the groups propensity score matching was performed using 9 preoperative variables, including age, body mass index, prostate specific antigen, biopsy Gleason Grade Group, clinical T stage, prostate volume on transrectal ultrasound, and the I-PSS (International Prostate Symptom Score), I-PSS quality of life score and International Index of Erectile Function-5 scores. Continence was assessed by the pad count every month postoperatively until month 6 and was converted to a binary outcome.  Results:   After propensity score matching 609 cases per group were matched with no significant difference in all 9 variables. The Kaplan-Meier curve analysis revealed that Retzius sparing robot-assisted radical prostatectomy was associated with a significantly better continence recovery rate than conventional robot-assisted radical prostatectomy during the 6-month study period (p <0.001).  Conclusions:   Based on propensity score matching with multiple variables and a large case series, Retzius sparing robot-assisted radical prostatectomy can be a candidate for future robot-assisted radical prostatectomy. It achieves better early continence recovery, a short operative time and early recovery compared to conventional robot-assisted radical prostatectomy.""","""['Jongsoo Lee', 'Ha Yan Kim', 'Hyeok Joon Goh', 'Ji Eun Heo', 'Ahmad Almujalhem', 'Ali A Alqahtani', 'Doo Yong Chung', 'Kidon Chang', 'Young Deuk Choi', 'Koon Ho Rha']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""J Urol""","""['Editorial Comment.', 'Editorial Comment.', 'A Pragmatic Randomized Controlled Trial Examining the Impact of the Retzius-sparing Approach on Early Urinary Continence Recovery After Robot-assisted Radical Prostatectomy.', 'Retzius-Sparing versus Standard Robot-Assisted Radical Prostatectomy: A Comparative Prospective Study of Nearly 500 Patients.', 'Postoperative functional and cancer control evaluation of conventional and Retzius-sparing robot-assisted radical prostatectomy: Comparison of selected cases by propensity score matching.', 'Retzius Sparing Radical Prostatectomy Versus Robot-assisted Radical Prostatectomy: Which Technique Is More Beneficial for Prostate Cancer Patients (MASTER Study)?

Preoperative BMI, basal levels of TT, and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) were evaluated in 361 consecutive patients undergoing radical prostatectomy with extended pelvic lymph node dissection between 2014 and 2017. Patients were grouped into either nonmetastatic, one, or more than one metastatic lymph node invasion groups. The association among clinical factors and LNI was evaluated. LNI was detected in 52 (14.4%) patients: 28 (7.8%) cases had one metastatic node and 24 (6.6%) had more than one metastatic node. In the overall study population, BMI correlated inversely with TT (r = -0.256; P < 0.0001). In patients without metastases, BMI inversely correlated with TT (r = -0.282; P < 0.0001). In patients with metastasis, this correlation was lost. In the overall study population, BMI (odds ratio [OR] = 1.268; P = 0.005) was the only independent clinical factor associated with the risk of multiple metastatic LNI compared to cases with one metastatic node. In the nonmetastatic group, TT was lower in patients with BMI >28 kg m-2 (P < 0.0001). In patients with any LNI, this association was lost (P = 0.232).

Discovery of novel proteins and elucidation of receptor targets can be accomplished using mass spectrometry (MS). We describe a case study of such a molecule, which our lab has studied using MS in combination with other protein identification techniques, such as immunohistochemistry and Western Blotting. This molecule is known as tumor differentiation factor (TDF), a recently-found protein secreted by the pituitary into the blood. TDF mRNA has been detected in brain; not heart, placenta, lung, liver, skeletal muscle, or pancreas. Currently TDF has an unclear function, and prior to our studies, its localization was only minimally understood, with no understanding of receptor targets. We investigated the distribution of TDF in the rat brain using immunohistochemistry (IHC) and immunofluorescence (IF). TDF protein was detected in pituitary and most other brain regions, in specific neurons but not astrocytes. We found TDF immunoreactivity in cultured neuroblastoma, not astrocytoma. These data suggest that TDF is localized to neurons, not to astrocytes. Our group also conducted studies to identify the TDF receptor (TDF-R). Using LC-MS/MS and Western blotting, we identified the members of the Heat Shock 70-kDa family of proteins (HSP70) as potential TDF-R candidates in both MCF7 and BT-549 human breast cancer cells (HBCC) and PC3, DU145, and LNCaP human prostate cancer cells (HPCC), but not in HeLa cells, NG108 neuroblastoma, or HDF-a and BLK CL.4 cells fibroblasts or fibroblast-like cells.

In the present study, the application of 152Tb, in combination with PSMA-617 for imaging of prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA)-positive prostate cancer, was demonstrated in a preclinical setting and in a patient with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC).  Results: 152Tb was produced at the ISOLDE facility at CERN/Geneva, Switzerland, by spallation, followed by on-line mass separation. The chemical separation was performed at Paul Scherrer Institute using chromatographic methods, as previously reported. 152Tb was employed for labeling PSMA-617, and the radioligand was extensively investigated in vitro to demonstrate similar characteristics to its 177Lu-labeled counterpart. Preclinical PET/CT imaging studies performed with mice enabled visualization of PSMA-positive PC-3 PIP tumors, while uptake in PSMA-negative PC-3 flu tumors were absent. Based on these promising preclinical results, 152Tb was shipped to Zentralklinik Bad Berka, Germany, where it was used for labeling of PSMA-617, enabling PET imaging of a patient with mCRPC. PET/CT scans were performed over a period of 25 h post injection (p.i.) of the radioligand (140 MBq). The images were of diagnostic quality, particularly those acquired at later time points, and enabled the detection of the same metastatic lesions and of local recurrent tumor as previously detected by 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT acquired 45 min p.i.  Conclusions:   The results of this study demonstrate the successful preparation and preclinical testing of 152Tb-PSMA-617 and its first application in a patient with mCRPC.

We used a meta-analytic approach to estimate DPHs across cancer trials, investigate associated factors, and evaluate data-analysis approaches for future trials.Experimental Design: We searched PubMed for phase III trials in breast, lung, prostate, and colorectal cancer published in a preselected list of journals between 2014 and 2016 and extracted individual patient-level data (IPLD) from Kaplan-Meier curves. We re-analyzed IPLD to identify DPHs. Potential efficiency gains, when DPHs were present, of alternative statistical methods relative to standard log-rank based analysis were expressed as sample-size requirements for a fixed power level.  Results:   From 152 trials, we obtained IPLD on 129,401 patients. Among 304 Kaplan-Meier figures, 75 (24.7%) exhibited evidence of DPHs, including eight of 14 (57%) KM pairs from immunotherapy trials. Trial type [immunotherapy, odds ratio (OR), 4.29; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.11-16.6], metastatic patient population (OR, 3.18; 95% CI, 1.26-8.05), and non-OS endpoints (OR, 3.23; 95% CI, 1.79-5.88) were associated with DPHs. In immunotherapy trials, alternative statistical approaches allowed for more efficient clinical trials with fewer patients (up to 74% reduction) relative to log-rank testing.  Conclusions:   DPHs were found in a notable proportion of time-to-event outcomes in published clinical trials in oncology and was more common for immunotherapy trials and non-OS endpoints.

Objective:   To investigate the risk of depression following radical prostatectomy focussing on the impact of surgery and subsequent treatment with salvage radiation or androgen deprivation therapy.  Design, setting, and participants:   A population-based cohort study of 5570 men who underwent radical prostatectomy in Denmark from 1998 to 2011 was identified in the Danish Prostate Cancer Registry.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Data on covariates and primary outcome defined as a hospital contact for depression or a redeemed antidepressant prescription were obtained from nationwide Danish registries. The risk of depression was evaluated using cumulative incidence functions and Cox models with time since surgery as an underlying time scale. Exposure to salvage procedures was included as time-varying covariates, and analyses were adjusted for confounders.  Results and limitations:   The cumulative incidence of depression was increased in men who had undergone surgery compared with cancer-free men throughout follow-up of up to 18yr, particularly among men on androgen deprivation therapy. Compared with no subsequent treatment, the risk of depression was increased with subsequent androgen deprivation therapy (hazard ratio [HR] 1.8, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.4-2.3), salvage radiation (HR 1.3, 95% CI 1.0-1.6), and the treatments combined (HR 2.2, 95% CI 1.8-2.8) after adjustments for age, year of surgery, income, and cohabitation status. Further adjustment for comorbidity hardly changed the estimates.  Conclusions:   Radical prostatectomy and subsequent salvage procedures increase the risk of depression, and men with subsequent androgen deprivation therapy are mainly at risk. Clinicians should thus be aware of depressive symptoms in patients receiving treatment for postsurgical relapse.

Objective:   To elucidate PC PSMA expression and associate this with defective DNA damage repair (DDR).  Design, setting, and participants:   Membranous PSMA (mPSMA) expression was scored immunohistochemically from metastatic castration-resistant PC (mCRPC) and matching, same-patient, diagnostic biopsies, and correlated with next-generation sequencing (NGS) and clinical outcome data.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Expression of mPSMA was quantitated by modified H-score. Patient DNA was tested by NGS. Gene expression and activity scores were determined from mCRPC transcriptomes. Statistical correlations utilised Wilcoxon signed rank tests, survival was estimated by Kaplan-Meier test, and sample heterogeneity was quantified by Shannon's diversity index.  Results and limitations:   Expression of mPSMA at diagnosis was associated with higher Gleason grade (p=0.04) and worse overall survival (p=0.006). Overall, mPSMA expression levels increased at mCRPC (median H-score [interquartile range]: castration-sensitive prostate cancer [CSPC] 17.5 [0.0-60.0] vs mCRPC 55.0 [2.8-117.5]). Surprisingly, 42% (n=16) of CSPC and 27% (n=16) of mCRPC tissues sampled had no detectable mPSMA (H-score <10). Marked intratumour heterogeneity of mPSMA expression, with foci containing no detectable PSMA, was observed in all mPSMA expressing CSPC (100%) and 37 (84%) mCRPC biopsies. Heterogeneous intrapatient mPSMA expression between metastases was also observed, with the lowest expression in liver metastases. Tumours with DDR had higher mPSMA expression (p=0.016; 87.5 [25.0-247.5] vs 20 [0.3-98.8]; difference in medians 60 [5.0-95.0]); validation cohort studies confirmed higher mPSMA expression in patients with deleterious aberrations in BRCA2 (p<0.001; median H-score: 300 [165-300]; difference in medians 195.0 [100.0-270.0]) and ATM (p=0.005; 212.5 [136.3-300]; difference in medians 140.0 [55.0-200]) than in molecularly unselected mCRPC biopsies (55.0 [2.75-117.5]). Validation studies using mCRPC transcriptomes corroborated these findings, also indicating that SOX2 high tumours have low PSMA expression.  Conclusions:   Membranous PSMA expression is upregulated in some but not all PCs, with mPSMA expression demonstrating marked inter- and intrapatient heterogeneity. DDR aberrations are associated with higher mPSMA expression and merit further evaluation as predictive biomarkers of response for PSMA-targeted therapies in larger, prospective cohorts.  Patient summary:   Through analysis of prostate cancer samples, we report that the presence of prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) is extremely variable both within one patient and between different patients. This may limit the usefulness of PSMA scans and PSMA-targeted therapies. We show for the first time that prostate cancers with defective DNA repair produce more PSMA and so may respond better to PSMA-targeting treatments.""","""['Alec Paschalis', 'Beshara Sheehan', 'Ruth Riisnaes', 'Daniel Nava Rodrigues', 'Bora Gurel', 'Claudia Bertan', 'Ana Ferreira', 'Maryou B K Lambros', 'George Seed', 'Wei Yuan', 'David Dolling', 'Jon C Welti', 'Antje Neeb', 'Semini Sumanasuriya', 'Pasquale Rescigno', 'Diletta Bianchini', 'Nina Tunariu', 'Suzanne Carreira', 'Adam Sharp', 'Wim Oyen', 'Johann S de Bono']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Eur Urol""","""['Tumour Heterogeneity and Resistance to Therapy in Prostate Cancer: A Fundamental Limitation of Prostate-specific Membrane Antigen Theranostics or a Key Strength?', 'Re: Prostate-specific Membrane Antigen Heterogeneity and DNA Repair Defects in Prostate Cancer.', 'Editorial comment: the effect of neoadjuvant chemotherapy on tumour downstaging and outcomes in patients with muscle invasive bladder cancers.', 'Poor Outcomes for Patients with Metastatic Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer with Low Prostate-specific Membrane Antigen (PSMA) Expression Deemed Ineligible for 177Lu-labelled PSMA Radioligand Therapy.', 'Genomic characterization of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer patients undergoing PSMA radioligand therapy: A single-center experience.', 'Imaging expression of prostate-specific membrane antigen and response to PSMA-targeted β-emitting radionuclide therapies in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Efficacy Against Human Prostate Cancer by Prostate-specific Membrane Antigen-specific, Transforming Growth Factor-β Insensitive Genetically Targeted CD8+ T-cells Derived from Patients with Metastatic Castrate-resistant Disease.', '177Lu-PSMA-RLT of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer: limitations and improvements.', 'A look into the future: the role of PSMA beyond prostate cancer.', 'Genomic and Phenotypic Biomarkers for Precision Medicine Guidance in Advanced Prostate Cancer.', 'Prediction of clinically significant prostate cancer using a novel 68Ga-PSMA PET-CT and multiparametric MRI-based model.', 'Repurposing Niclosamide as a Therapeutic Drug against Acute Liver Failure by Suppressing Ferroptosis.', 'A Prognostic Model of Angiogenesis and Neutrophil Extracellular Traps Related Genes Manipulating Tumor Microenvironment in Colon Cancer.']"""

However, subjective utilities in long-term survivors of prostate cancer (PCa) with various oncological and functional outcomes have not been well described.  Objective:   To quantify utilities in long-term survivors of PCa using the standard gamble method, generally regarded as the approach best grounded in economic theory.  Design, setting, and participants:   We performed a cross-sectional study nested within a prospective cohort-Cancer of the Prostate Strategic Urologic Research Endeavor (CaPSURE). Overall, 1884 (59.7%) of 3155 active participants across all disease states returned the questionnaire.  Intervention:   Various primary treatments for PCa.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Utility values for PCa health, sexual function, urinary function, bowel function, and overall health were measured, based on patients' conditions at the time of the survey. Bias correction methods were employed.  Results and limitations:   After exclusion of incomplete or disqualified data, 1740 (92.3% of responding) patients were included in the final analysis. The mean age was 73.1 ± 8.2 yr at a median of 9 yr (interquartile range: 6-11) since diagnosis. Mean utilities for PCa health and overall health were 0.934 ± 0.120 and 0.960 ± 0.100, respectively. After bias correction by probability weighting function, utilities were 0.866 ± 0.154 and 0.897 ± 0.142, and by mixed model correction, 0.845 ± 0.186 and 0.884 ± 0.176, respectively. Measured utilities were similarly high for specific functional outcomes, even with bias corrections. Survivorship bias and skewed proportion of disease status due to natural history of PCa were potential limitations.  Conclusions:   Standard gamble-based utilities in long-term survivors of PCa were much higher than those determined previously. The results indicate substantial human resilience: most PCa patients adapt to their health status over time even if they experience incomplete functional recovery and would not take risk in pursuit of better quality of life.  Patient summary:   We elicited health utilities (measures of quality of life) among long-term survivors of prostate cancer using the most robust method. These were much higher than previously reported values that were based on theoretical scenarios or indirect methods. Long-term survivors of prostate cancer may adapt well to their health conditions over time even if they experience disease-specific or functional problems.""","""['Chang Wook Jeong', 'Janet E Cowan', 'Jeanette M Broering', 'Renske M T Ten Ham', 'Leslie S Wilson', 'Peter R Carroll', 'Matthew R Cooperberg']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Eur Urol""","""['Resilience of men and the gap hypothesis of quality of life: Health utility outcome measurement in prostate cancer.', 'Long-term health-related quality of life after primary treatment for localized prostate cancer: results from the CaPSURE registry.', 'A reference set of health utilities for long-term survivors of prostate cancer: population-based data from Ontario, Canada.', 'Community-based Outcomes of Open versus Robot-assisted Radical Prostatectomy.', 'The contemporary management of prostate cancer in the United States: lessons from the cancer of the prostate strategic urologic research endeavor (CapSURE), a national disease registry.', 'Health-related quality of life among long-term (≥5\xa0years) prostate cancer survivors by primary intervention: a systematic review.', 'Big Data Analytics in urology: the story so far and the road ahead.', 'The Relative Impact of Urinary and Sexual Function vs Bother on Health Utility for Men With Prostate Cancer.']"""

Previous studies have shown that depletion of GGCT blocks the growth of MCF7 breast cancer cells via upregulation of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21WAF1/CIP1 (p21); in addition, induction of autophagy plays a role in the upregulation of p21 upon GGCT knockdown. However, the mechanisms underlying induction of p21 in cancer cells are not fully understood. Here, we show that GGCT knockdown in PC3 human prostate cancer and A172 glioblastoma cells upregulates the mRNA and nuclear protein levels of Forkhead box O transcription factor 3a (FOXO3a), a transcriptional factor involved in tumor suppression. Simultaneous knockdown of FOXO3a and GGCT in PC3 and A172 cells attenuated upregulation of p21, followed by growth inhibition and cell death. Furthermore, simultaneous knockdown of GGCT and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) α, a metabolic stress sensor, in PC3 and A172 cells led to marked attenuation of cellular responses induced by GGCT knockdown, including an increase in FOXO3a phosphorylation at Ser413, upregulation of p21, growth inhibition, and cell death.

This pathway relies on mTORC1 sensing sufficient levels of intracellular amino acids, such as leucine, which are required for mTORC1 activation. However, it is currently unknown whether there is a direct link between these external growth signals and intracellular amino acid levels. In primary prostate cancer cells, intracellular leucine levels are regulated by L-type amino acid transporter 3 (LAT3/SLC43A1), and we therefore investigated whether LAT3 is regulated by growth factor signalling.  Methods:   To investigate how PI3K/Akt signalling regulates leucine transport, prostate cancer cells were treated with different PI3K/Akt inhibitors, or stable knock down of LAT3 by shRNA, followed by analysis of leucine uptake, western blotting, immunofluorescent staining and proximity ligation assay.  Results:   Inhibition of PI3K/Akt signalling significantly reduced leucine transport in LNCaP and PC-3 human prostate cancer cell lines, while growth factor addition significantly increased leucine uptake. These effects appeared to be mediated by LAT3 transport, as LAT3 knockdown blocked leucine uptake, and was not rescued by growth factor activation or further inhibited by signalling pathway inhibition. We further demonstrated that EGF significantly increased LAT3 protein levels when Akt was phosphorylated, and that Akt and LAT3 co-localised on the plasma membrane in EGF-activated LNCaP cells. These effects were likely due to stabilisation of LAT3 protein levels on the plasma membrane, with EGF treatment preventing ubiquitin-mediated LAT3 degradation.  Conclusion:   Growth factor-activated PI3K/Akt signalling pathway regulates leucine transport through LAT3 in prostate cancer cell lines. These data support a direct link between growth factor and amino acid uptake, providing a mechanism by which the cells rapidly coordinate amino acid uptake for cell growth.""","""['Blake K Zhang', 'Anne M Moran', 'Charles G Bailey', 'John E J Rasko', 'Jeff Holst', 'Qian Wang']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Cell Commun Signal""","""['Targeting amino acid transport in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer: effects on cell cycle, cell growth, and tumor development.', 'Androgen receptor and nutrient signaling pathways coordinate the demand for increased amino acid transport during prostate cancer progression.', 'Functional analysis of LAT3 in prostate cancer: Its downstream target and relationship with androgen receptor.', 'Regulation of PI3K effector signalling in cancer by the phosphoinositide phosphatases.', 'L-type amino acid transport and cancer: targeting the mTORC1 pathway to inhibit neoplasia.', 'Contribution of the L-Type Amino Acid Transporter Family in the Diagnosis and Treatment of Prostate Cancer.', '3,6-dichlorobenzobthiophene-2-carboxylic acid alleviates ulcerative colitis by suppressing mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 activation and regulating intestinal microbiota.', 'Impact of L-type amino acid transporter 3 on the prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma.', 'Dual contribution of the mTOR pathway and of the metabolism of amino acids in prostate cancer.', 'Targeting Amino Acid Metabolic Reprogramming via L-Type Amino Acid Transporter 1 (LAT1) for Endocrine-Resistant Breast Cancer.']"""

This study compares continence rates based on different methods and aims to identify the definition for continence which agrees best with the patients' subjective assessment of continence. Additionally, continence was controlled for multiple influencing factors.  Methods:   This prospective multicentre study was carried out in seven hospitals throughout Germany. Before and at 3, 6, and 12 months after surgery self-reporting questionnaires were completed and returned by 329 (84.4%) of 390 eligible patients. The questionnaires were independently evaluated and analysed by a third party. Association of continence with demographic, operative, and tumour factors in an ongoing comprehensive prostate cancer database was evaluated.  Results:   The continence rate drops substantially for patients undergoing radical prostatectomy but increases again with time. Concrete numbers vary considerably depending on definition - 44% at 3 months and 68% at 12 months after surgery (0 pads) vs. 71 and 90% (0-1 pads). Significant confounding variables regarding continence rate are nerve-sparing procedure, categorized Gleason score, rehabilitative cure treatment, and pelvic floor training. The definition of 0 pads for continence coincides greater than 0-1 pads with the patients' self-assessment of being continent.  Conclusion:   A standardized definition for continence would be desirable, as it is one of the most important preconditions to guarantee sound comparison of continence rates. Since there are enough other factors that make comparison difficult, we suggest using the definition of ""0 pads"". It is easily measured objectively, leaves no room for interpretation, and agrees best with the patients' self-assessment.""","""['Sigrun Holze', 'Meinhard Mende', 'Karl V Healy', 'Norbert Koehler', 'Lutz Gansera', 'Michael C Truss', 'Udo Rebmann', 'Stephan Degener', 'Jens-Uwe Stolzenburg']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""BMC Urol""","""['Urinary incontinence after radical prostatectomy: incidence by definition, risk factors and temporal trend in a large series with a long-term follow-up.', 'A Pragmatic Randomized Controlled Trial Examining the Impact of the Retzius-sparing Approach on Early Urinary Continence Recovery After Robot-assisted Radical Prostatectomy.', 'Efficacy of an assisted low-intensity programme of perioperative pelvic floor muscle training in improving the recovery of continence after radical prostatectomy: a randomized controlled trial.', 'Systematic review and meta-analysis of studies reporting urinary continence recovery after robot-assisted radical prostatectomy.', 'Preservation of the neurovascular bundles is associated with improved time to continence after radical prostatectomy but not long-term continence rates: results of a systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Erectile function, urinary continence and oncologic outcomes of neurovascular bundle sparing robot-assisted radical prostatectomy for high-risk prostate cancer: A systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Physiotherapy as an Effective Method to Support the Treatment of Male Urinary Incontinence: A Systematic Review.', 'Perioperative, functional, and oncologic outcomes in patients undergoing robot-assisted radical prostatectomy previous transurethral resection of prostate: a systematic review and meta-analysis of comparative trials.', 'Urinary Continence Recovery after Robotic Radical Prostatectomy without Anterior or Posterior Reconstruction: Experience from a Tertiary Referral Center.', 'A Matched-Pair Analysis after Robotic and Retropubic Radical Prostatectomy: A New Definition of Continence and the Impact of Different Surgical Techniques.']"""

Therefore, the purpose of this research was to determine the expression pattern and function of SETD5 in NSCLC.  Methods:   SETD5 was detected by immunohistochemical analysis in 147 patients with non-small cell lung cancer. SETD5 was overexpressed in A549 cells or suppressed with siRNA in H1299 cells. Wound healing and transwell assays were performed. The expression levels of SETD5, p-AKT/AKT, Snail, p-JNK/JNK, Slug, E-cadherin, Zo-1, p-P38/P38, occludin, α-catenin, p-ERK/ERK, and p-P90RSK/ P90RSK were assessed by western blot.  Results:   Online analysis of overall survival in 1928 patients with NSCLC showed that the SETD5 gene was related to worse overall survival (OS)(P < 0.001). The positive expression rate of SETD5 in noncancerous tissues was lower than that in cancerous tissues (16.7% vs. 44.2%, P < 0.001). SETD5 was significantly correlated with advanced TNM stage (P < 0.001), lymph node metastasis (P < 0.001) and overall survival rate (P < 0.001). Overexpression of SETD5 in A549 cells increased migration and invasion, while deletion of SETD5 in H1299 cells decreased migration and invasion. After overexpression of SETD5, the expression of ZO-1 was downregulated, and that of Snail was upregulated. After overexpression of SETD5, the levels of p-ERK and its downstream factor p-p90rsk increased.

The method is based on high bandwidth phase-cycled balanced steady-state free precession (bSSFP) sequence, which is available on many clinical scanners, does not require any additional post-processing or software, and has a higher signal-to-noise (SNR) compared to conventional gradient-echo (GE) imaging. Complex phase-cycled bSSFP data is acquired with different RF phase increment settings such that the manifestation of the artifacts around FMs in the acquired complex images is different for each dynamic acquisition and depends on the RF phase increment used. First, we performed numerical simulations to investigate the complex-valued phase-cycled bSSFP signal in the presence of a gold FM, and to investigate the relation of the true physical location of the FM with the geometrical manifestation of the artifacts. Next, to validate the simulations, we performed phantoms and in vivo studies and compared the experimentally obtained artifacts with those predicted in simulations. The accuracy of the method was assessed by comparing the distances between the FM's centers and the center of mass of FMs system measured using phase-cycled bSSFP MR images and using reference CT (or MRI-only) images. The results show accurate (within 1 mm) matching of FMs localization between CT and MR images on five patients, proving the feasibility of in vivo FMs detection on MR images only. The FMs show a positive contrast with respect to the prostate background on real/imaginary phase-cycled bSSFP images, which was confirmed by simulations.

Methods and materials:   Between April 2010 and January 2017, 100 patients were included in 7 centers. Disease extension was assessed by pelvic multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging and choline positron emission tomography in 87% and 94% of patients, respectively.

However, recent studies in prostate cancer suggest that paxillin also plays a critical role in regulating gene expression within the nucleus, serving as a liaison between cytoplasmic and nuclear MAPK and Androgen Receptor (AR) signaling. Here we used RNA-seq to examine the paxillin-regulated transcriptome in several human prostate cancer cell lines. First, we examined paxillin effects on androgen-mediated transcription in control or paxillin-depleted AR-positive LNCaP and C4-2 human prostate cancer cells. In androgen-dependent LNCaP cells, we found over 1000 paxillin-dependent androgen-responsive genes, some of which are involved in endocrine therapy resistance. Most paxillin-dependent AR-mediated genes in LNCaP cells were no longer paxillin-dependent in androgen-sensitive, castration-resistant C4-2 cells, suggesting that castration-resistance may markedly alter paxillin effects on genomic AR signaling. To examine the paxillin-regulated transcriptome in the absence of androgen signaling, we performed RNA-seq in AR-negative PC3 human prostate cancer cells. Paxillin enhanced several pro-proliferative pathways, including the CyclinD/Rb/E2F and DNA replication/repair pathways. Additionally, paxillin suppressed pro-apoptotic genes, including CASP1 and TNFSF10. Quantitative PCR confirmed that these pathways are similarly regulated by paxillin in LNCaP and C4-2 cells. Functional studies showed that, while paxillin stimulated cell proliferation, it had minimum effect on apoptosis. Thus, paxillin appears to be an important transcriptional regulator in prostate cancer, and analysis of its transcriptome might lead to novel approaches toward the diagnosis and treatment of this important disease.""","""['Xiaoting Ma', 'Anindita Biswas', 'Stephen R Hammes']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Steroids""","""['Paxillin regulates androgen- and epidermal growth factor-induced MAPK signaling and cell proliferation in prostate cancer cells.', 'Paxillin mediates extranuclear and intranuclear signaling in prostate cancer proliferation.', '6-(3,4-Dihydro-1H-isoquinoline-2-yl)-N-(6-methoxypyridine-2-yl) nicotinamide-26 (DIMN-26) decreases cell proliferation by induction of apoptosis and downregulation of androgen receptor signaling in human prostate cancer cells.', 'Context dependent regulatory patterns of the androgen receptor and androgen receptor target genes.', 'Prostate cancer regulatory networks.', 'The Role of Paxillin Aberrant Expression in Cancer and Its Potential as a Target for Cancer Therapy.', 'Paxillin family of focal adhesion adaptor proteins and regulation of cancer cell invasion.']"""

Development and progression of PCa is associated with aberrant expression of oncogenic splicing-variants (eg, AR-v7), suggesting that dysregulation of the splicing process might represent a potential actionable target for PCa. Expression levels (mRNA and protein) of SF3B1, one of the main components of the splicing machinery, were analyzed in different cohorts of PCa patients (clinically localized [n = 84], highly aggressive PCa [n = 42], and TCGA dataset [n = 497]). Functional and mechanistic assays were performed in response to pladienolide-B in nontumor and tumor-derived prostate cells. Our results revealed that SF3B1 was overexpressed in PCa tissues and its levels were associated with clinically relevant PCa-aggressive features (eg, metastasis/AR-v7 expression). Moreover, inhibition of SF3B1 activity by pladienolide-B reduced functional parameters of aggressiveness (proliferation/migration/tumorspheres-formation/apoptosis) in PCa cell lines, irrespective of AR-v7 expression, and reduced viability of primary PCa cells. Antitumor actions of pladienolide-B involved: (1) inhibition of PI3K/AKT and JNK signaling pathways, (2) modulation of tumor markers and splicing variants (AR-v7/In1-ghrelin), and (3) regulation of key components of mRNA homeostasis-associated machineries (spliceosome/SURF/EJC).

Background:   Sexual dysfunction is not frequently discussed by healthcare professionals; lack of knowledge and training are two of the most often reported barriers. Provision of additional training could improve knowledge, competence and general practice of healthcare professionals.  Design:   Two questionnaires were used in this pre-post study to determine knowledge, competence and general practice at the time of the symposium and six months afterwards.  Methods:   In order to perform repeated measures to analyse alterations among participating healthcare professionals (n = 55), the McNemar's test was used. A STROBE checklist was completed.  Results:   Seventy-three per cent (n = 40) stated that not enough attention was paid to prostate cancer-related sexual dysfunction during their education. Nurses felt significantly less competent in discussing sexual function, advising on sexual dysfunction and actively inquiring sexual complaints compared to other healthcare professionals. After the symposium, sexual dysfunction was significantly more often discussed. No significant effects were found on knowledge on sexual dysfunction, knowledge on treatment of sexual dysfunction, competence in discussing sexual function, advising on sexual dysfunction, actively inquiring sexual complaints and rate of referral. Tools needed to address sexual dysfunction concerned written information materials (75.5%) and a website containing adequate information (56.6%).  Conclusions:   The symposium had no significant influence on knowledge, competence and rate of referral in men with sexual dysfunction after prostate cancer treatment. However, sexual dysfunction was more frequently discussed after the symposium, so increase of awareness of consequences of prostate cancer treatment was achieved.  Relevance to clinical practice:   Consequences of prostate cancer treatment to sexual function should be taken in consideration in daily practice; written information materials and a website containing adequate information were indicated as valuable resources to address sexual dysfunction in routine consultations.""","""['Lorena A Grondhuis Palacios', 'Nora Hendriks', 'Marjolein E M den Ouden', 'Yacov Reisman', 'Jack J H Beck', 'Brenda L den Oudsten', 'Gaby F van Ek', 'Hein Putter', 'Rob C M Pelger', 'Henk W Elzevier']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""J Clin Nurs""","""['Can the provision of sexual healthcare for oncology patients be improved?

Methods:   A pre-contoured computed tomography (CT) dataset containing planning target volume 1 (PTV1) prostate and seminal vesicles (single dose [SD] 1.8 Gy, total dose [TD] 59.4 Gy), PTV2 prostate (simultaneously integrated boost [SIB], SD 2.0 Gy, TD 66 Gy), PTV3 prostate and seminal vesicles approach (SD 1.8 Gy, TD 73.8 Gy/80.4 Gy SIB) as well as organs at risk (OAR: rectum, bladder, femoral heads, bowel, anus) was offered to the members of the task group IMRT (intensity-modulated radiation therapy) of the German Society for Medical Physics. The purpose was to calculate one combined treatment plan (TP) for PTV1 and PTV2, as well as a separate one for PTV3. Dose volume histograms (DVH), different dose values, conformity index (CI), homogeneity index (HI), gradient index (GI) and a new ""better than average score"" were used to analyse the dose distributions.  Results:   Altogether 44 institutions took part in this study and submitted acceptable dose distributions for the PTVs. However, there were statistically significant differences, especially for the doses administered to the OAR, such as rectum, bladder and femoral heads. Differences between the treatment plans were not easily detectable by visual inspection of the isodose distribution. Dose maxima may occur outside the PTV. Even though scoring indices are already published, the new ""better than average score"" was needed to identify a plan that minimises dose to all OAR simultaneously.  Conclusion:   Different medical physicists or dosimetrists, photon energies, treatment planning systems, and treatment machines have an impact on the resulting dose distribution. However, the differences only become apparent when comparing DVH, analysing dose values, comparing CI, HI, GI, as well as reviewing the dose distribution in every single plane. A new score was introduced to identify treatment plans that simultaneously deliver a low dose to all OAR.

While, enzalutamide provides a substantial survival benefit, it is not curative and many patients develop resistance to therapy. Although not yet fully understood, resistance can develop through a number of mechanisms, such as AR copy number gain, the generation of splice variants such as AR-V7 and mutations within the ligand binding domain (LBD) of the AR. circular RNAs (circRNAs) are a novel type of non-coding RNA, which can regulate the function of miRNA, and may play a key role in the development of drug resistance. circRNAs are highly resistant to degradation, are detectable in plasma and, therefore may serve a role as clinical biomarkers. In this study, AR-V7 expression was assessed in an isogenic model of enzalutamide resistance. The model consisted of age matched control cells and two sub-line clones displaying varied resistance to enzalutamide. circRNA profiling was performed on the panel using a high throughout microarray assay. Bioinformatic analysis identified a number of differentially expressed circRNAs and predicted five miRNA binding sites for each circRNA. miRNAs were stratified based on known associations with prostate cancer, and targets were validated using qPCR. Overall, circRNAs were more often down regulated in resistant cell lines compared with control (588 vs. 278). Of particular interest was hsa_circ_0004870, which was down-regulated in enzalutamide resistant cells (p ≤ 0.05, vs. sensitive cells), decreased in cells that highly express AR (p ≤ 0.01, vs. AR negative), and decreased in malignant cells (p ≤ 0.01, vs. benign). The associated parental gene was identified as RBM39, a member of the U2AF65 family of proteins. Both genes were down-regulated in resistant cells (p < 0.05, vs. sensitive cells). This is one of the first studies to profile and demonstrate discrete circRNA expression patterns in an enzalutamide resistant cell line model of prostate cancer. Our data suggests that hsa_circ_0004870, through RBM39, may play a critical role in the development of enzalutamide resistance in CRPC.""","""['John Greene', 'Anne-Marie Baird', 'Orla Casey', 'Lauren Brady', 'Gordon Blackshields', 'Marvin Lim', ""Odharnaith O'Brien"", 'Steven G Gray', 'Raymond McDermott', 'Stephen P Finn']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Sci Rep""","""['Combination therapy with androgen receptor N-terminal domain antagonist EPI-7170 and enzalutamide yields synergistic activity in AR-V7-positive prostate cancer.', 'Isolation and characterization of castration-resistant prostate cancer LNCaP95 clones.', 'hsa_circ_0001275 Is One of a Number of circRNAs Dysregulated in Enzalutamide Resistant Prostate Cancer and Confers Enzalutamide Resistance In Vitro.', ""Role of BioResponse 3,3'-Diindolylmethane in the Treatment of Human Prostate Cancer: Clinical Experience."", 'Understanding and overcoming the mechanisms of primary and acquired resistance to abiraterone and enzalutamide in castration resistant prostate cancer.', 'Circ_0010235 confers cisplatin resistance in lung cancer by upregulating E2F7 through absorbing miR-379-5p.', 'Plasma extracellular vesicle circRNA signature and resistance to abiraterone in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'AR Structural Variants and Prostate Cancer.', 'Exploratory Circular RNA Profiling in Adrenocortical Tumors.', 'Non-coding RNAs: are they the protagonist or antagonist in the regulation of leukemia?']"""

Evidence has been presented that the unfolded protein response (UPR) leads to EBV lytic gene expression. Clofoctol, an antibacterial antibiotic, has been reported to upregulate the UPR in prostate cancer cell lines and to slow their growth. We investigated the effects of clofoctol on an EBV-positive Burkitt lymphoma cell line and confirmed the upregulation of all three branches of the UPR and activation of EBV lytic gene expression. While immediate early, early, and late EBV RNAs were all upregulated, immediate early and early viral proteins but not late viral proteins were expressed. Furthermore, infectious virions were not produced. The use of clofoctol in combination with a protein kinase R-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase inhibitor led to expression of late viral proteins. The effects of clofoctol on EBV lytic protein upregulation were not limited to lymphoid tumor cell lines but also occurred in naturally infected epithelial gastric cancer and nasopharyngeal cancer cell lines. An agent that upregulates lytic viral protein expression but that does not lead to the production of infectious virions may have particular value for lytic induction strategies in the clinical setting.IMPORTANCE Epstein-Barr virus is associated with many different cancers. In these cancers the viral genome is predominantly latent; i.e., most viral genes are not expressed, most viral proteins are not synthesized, and new virions are not produced. Some strategies for treating these cancers involve activation of lytic viral gene expression. We identify an antibacterial antibiotic, clofoctol, that is an activator of EBV lytic RNA and protein expression but that does not lead to virion production.""","""['Jaeyeun Lee#', 'John G Kosowicz#', 'S Diane Hayward', 'Prashant Desai', 'Jennifer Stone', 'Jae Myun Lee', 'Jun O Liu', 'Richard F Ambinder']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""J Virol""","""['Arsenicals, the Integrated Stress Response, and Epstein-Barr Virus Lytic Gene Expression.', 'Interferon-γ-inducible protein 16 (IFI16) is required for the maintenance of Epstein-Barr virus latency.', 'Histone Loaders CAF1 and HIRA Restrict Epstein-Barr Virus B-Cell Lytic Reactivation.', 'Regulation of the latent-lytic switch in Epstein-Barr virus.', 'EBV Infection and Glucose Metabolism in Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma.', 'Hippo signaling effectors YAP and TAZ induce Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) lytic reactivation through TEADs in epithelial cells.', 'Current approach and novel perspectives in nasopharyngeal carcinoma: the role of targeting proteasome dysregulation as a molecular landmark in nasopharyngeal cancer.', 'Arsenicals, the Integrated Stress Response, and Epstein-Barr Virus Lytic Gene Expression.', 'Lytic Induction Therapy against Epstein-Barr Virus-Associated Malignancies: Past, Present, and Future.', 'Targeting Epstein-Barr Virus in Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma.']"""

Degarelix (Firmagon), a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) receptor antagonist differs from luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonists by avoiding ""testosterone flare"" and lower follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels. The direct effect of degarelix and leuprolide on human prostate cancer cells was evaluated. In LNCaP, C4-2BMDVR, and CWR22Rv1 cells, degarelix significantly reduced cell viability compared with the controls (P ≤ 0.01). Leuprolide was stimulatory in the same cell lines. In C4-2B MDVR cells, degarelix alone or combined with abiraterone or enzalutamide reduced the AR-V7 protein expression compared with the control group. SCID mice bearing VCaP xenograft tumors were divided into 4 groups and treated with surgical castration, degarelix, leuprolide, or buffer alone for 4 weeks. Leuprolide slightly suppressed tumor growth compared with the vehicle control group (P > 0.05). Tumors in degarelix-treated mice were 67% of those in the leuprolide-treatment group but 170% larger than in surgically castrated ones. Measurements of intratumoral steroids in serum, tumor samples, or treated cell pellets by LC/MS confirmed that degarelix better decreased the levels of testosterone and steroidogenesis pathway intermediates, comparable to surgical castration, whereas leuprolide had no inhibitory effect. Collectively, our results suggested a selective mechanism of action of degarelix against androgen steroidogenesis and AR-variants. This study provides additional molecular insights regarding the mechanism of degarelix compared with GnRH agonist therapy, which may have clinical implications.""","""['Vito Cucchiara', 'Joy C Yang', 'Chengfei Liu', 'Hans H Adomat', 'Emma S Tomlinson Guns', 'Martin E Gleave', 'Allen C Gao', 'Christopher P Evans']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Mol Cancer Ther""","""['In search of the molecular mechanisms mediating the inhibitory effect of the GnRH antagonist degarelix on human prostate cell growth.', 'FSH suppression and tumour control in patients with prostate cancer during androgen deprivation with a GnRH agonist or antagonist.', 'Rapid suppression of plasma testosterone levels and tumor growth in the dunning rat model treated with degarelix, a new gonadotropin-releasing hormone antagonist.', 'Gonadotropin-releasing hormone: an update review of the antagonists versus agonists.', 'Degarelix: a gonadotropin-releasing hormone antagonist for the management of prostate cancer.', 'Androgen Receptor Signaling Inhibition in Advanced Castration Resistance Prostate Cancer: What Is Expected for the Near Future?', 'Impact of add-back FSH on human and mouse prostate following gonadotropin ablation by GnRH antagonist treatment.', 'Crosstalk between estrogen, dendritic cells, and SARS-CoV-2 infection.', 'Dissecting the Hormonal Signaling Landscape in Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone Receptors in Prostate Cancer: Molecular Aspects and Biological Functions.']"""

Consistent with GR modulation of ER activity, high tumor glucocorticoid receptor (GR) expression correlates with improved relapse-free survival in ER+ breast cancer (BC) patients.  Methods:   In vitro cell proliferation assays were used to assess ER-mediated BC cell proliferation following GR modulation. ER chromatin association following ER/GR co-liganding was measured using global ChIP sequencing and directed ChIP analysis of proliferative gene enhancers.  Results:   We found that GR liganding with either a pure agonist or a selective GR modulator (SGRM) slowed estradiol (E2)-mediated proliferation in ER+ BC models. SGRMs that antagonized transcription of GR-unique genes both promoted GR chromatin association and inhibited ER chromatin localization at common DNA enhancer sites. Gene expression analysis revealed that ER and GR co-activation decreased proliferative gene activation (compared to ER activation alone), specifically reducing CCND1, CDK2, and CDK6 gene expression. We also found that ligand-dependent GR occupancy of common ER-bound enhancer regions suppressed both wild-type and mutant ER chromatin association and decreased corresponding gene expression. In vivo, treatment with structurally diverse SGRMs also reduced MCF-7 Y537S ER-expressing BC xenograft growth.  Conclusion:   These studies demonstrate that liganded GR can suppress ER chromatin occupancy at shared ER-regulated enhancers, including CCND1 (Cyclin D1), regardless of whether the ligand is a classic GR agonist or antagonist.

Methods:   The prostate was obtained from 153 patients, weighed and measured to obtain length (L), height (H), and width (W). The density was determined by water displacement to calculate volume. TRUS data were retrieved from patient charts. Linear regression analyses were performed to compare various prostate volume formulas, including the commonly used ellipsoid formula and newly introduced bullet-shaped formula.  Results:   By relating measured prostate volumes from fresh prostates to TRUS-estimated prostate volumes, 0.66 was the best fitting coefficient in the (L x H x W x Coefficient) equation. This newfound coefficient combined with outlier removal yielded a linear equation with an R2 of 0.64, compared to 0.55 and 0.60, for the ellipsoid and bullet, respectively.

However, the existing methods have major limitations in sensitivity, accuracy, and/or readiness for in vivo applications. Here, we aim to develop a straight-forward method by using nucleotide insertion/deletion resulted from genome editing. In this system, a target sequence with frame-shifting length is inserted after the start codon of a cerulean fluorescence protein (CFP) to inactivate its fluorescence. As such, only a new insertion/deletion event in the target sequence will reactivate the fluorescence. This reporter is therefore termed as ""Insertion/deletion-activated frame-shift fluorescence protein"". To increase its traceability, an internal ribosome entry site and a red fluorescence protein mCherryFP are placed downstream of the reporter. The percentage of CFP-positive cells can be quantified by fluorescence measuring devices such as flow cytometer as the readout for genome editing frequency.  Results:   To test the background noise level, sensitivity, and quantitative capacity of this new reporter, we applied this approach to examine the efficiency of genome editing of CRISPR/Cas9 on two different targeting sequences and in three different cell lines, in the presence or absence of guide-RNAs with or without efficiency-compromising mutations. We found that the insertion/deletion-activated frame-shift fluorescence protein has very low background signal, can detect low-efficiency genome editing events driven by mutated guideRNAs, and can quantitatively distinguish genome editing by normal or mutated guideRNA. To further test whether the positive editing event detected by this reporter indeed correspond to genuine insertion/deletion on the genome, we enriched the CFP-positive cells to examine their fluorescence under confocal microscope and to analyze the DNA sequence of the reporter in the genome by Sanger sequencing. We found that the positive events captured by this reporter indeed correlates with genuine DNA insertion/deletion in the expected genome location.  Conclusion:   The insertion/deletion-activated frame-shift fluorescence protein reporter has very low background, high sensitivity, and is quantitative in nature.

Our analyses revealed five mCRPC phenotypes based on the expression of well-characterized androgen receptor (AR) or neuroendocrine (NE) genes: (i) AR-high tumors (ARPC), (ii) AR-low tumors (ARLPC), (iii) amphicrine tumors composed of cells co-expressing AR and NE genes (AMPC), (iv) double-negative tumors (i.e. AR-/NE-; DNPC) and (v) tumors with small cell or NE gene expression without AR activity (SCNPC). RE1-silencing transcription factor (REST) activity, which suppresses NE gene expression, was lost in AMPC and SCNPC PDX models. However, knockdown of REST in cell lines revealed that attenuated REST activity drives the AMPC phenotype but is not sufficient for SCNPC conversion. We also identified a subtype of DNPC tumors with squamous differentiation and generated an encompassing 26-gene transcriptional signature that distinguished the five mCRPC phenotypes.

Materials and methods:   Using SEER (Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results)-Medicare we identified men diagnosed with prostate cancer between 2007 and 2011. We developed physician-hospital networks by identifying the treating physician of each patient based on the primary treatment received and subsequently assigning each physician to a hospital. We examined the relative distribution of prostate cancer treatments stratified by whether stereotactic body radiation therapy was performed in a network by fitting logistic regression models with robust SEs to account for patient clustering in networks.  Results:   We identified 344 physician-hospital networks, including 30 (8.7%) and 314 (91.3%) in which stereotactic body radiation therapy was and was not performed, respectively. Networks in which that therapy was and was not done did not differ with time in the performance of robotic and radical prostatectomy, and active surveillance (all p >0.05). The relationship with intensity modulated radiation therapy did not show any consistent temporal pattern. In networks in which it was performed less intensity modulated radiation therapy was initially done but there were similar rates in later years. Brachytherapy trends differed among networks in which stereotactic body radiation therapy was vs was not performed with a lower brachytherapy rate in networks in which stereotactic body radiation therapy was done (p=0.03).  Conclusions:   Surgery and active surveillance rates did not differ in networks in which stereotactic body radiation therapy was vs was not performed but when that therapy was done there was a lower brachytherapy rate.

The purpose of this study was to compare in a multireader manner the diagnostic accuracies of 3-T multiparametric MRI interpretation and serial prostate-specific antigen (PSA) measurement in predicting the presence of residual clinically significant prostate cancer after focal laser ablation. MATERIALS AND METHODS. Eighteen men had undergone focal laser ablation for low- or intermediate-risk prostate cancer as part of two National Cancer Institute-funded phase 1 clinical trials. Multiparametric MRI was performed immediately after and 6 and 12 months after focal laser ablation. Serial PSA measurements after focal laser ablation were recorded, and MRI-ultrasound fusion biopsy was performed 6 and 12 months after ablation and served as the reference standard. Multiparametric MRI was performed at 3 T with pelvic phased-array coils. T2-weighted, DW, and dynamic contrast-enhanced MR images were retrospectively assessed by two blinded radiologists using a 3-point Likert scale (0-2). Inter-reader agreement was assessed with the Cohen kappa statistic. The diagnostic accuracies of multiparametric MRI and PSA measurement were compared. RESULTS. Residual clinically significant prostate cancer was identified in 11 of 18 (61%) men. Logistic regression analysis of serial PSA measurements yielded a correct classification rate of 61.1% (p > 0.05). Using a multiparametric MRI threshold score of 4 or greater, both radiologists made correct classifications for 16 of 18 men (89%) at 6 months and 15 of 17 men (88%) at 12 months. Interreader agreement was substantial to excellent for T2-weighted imaging, DWI, and dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI and improved uniformly from 6 to 12 months. Logistic regression analysis of the retrospectively reviewed multiparametric MR images yielded AUCs greater than 0.90 for each radiologist 6 and 12 months after focal laser ablation (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION. Multiparametric MRI 6 and 12 months after focal laser ablation significantly outperformed serial PSA measurements for predicting the presence of residual clinically significant prostate cancer.""","""['Ely R Felker', 'Steven S Raman', 'David S K Lu', 'Mitch Tuttle', 'Daniel J Margolis', 'Fuad F ElKhoury', 'James Sayre', 'Leonard S Marks']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""AJR Am J Roentgenol""","""['MRI Findings After MRI-Guided Focal Laser Ablation of Prostate Cancer.', 'Abbreviated Biparametric Prostate MR Imaging in Men with Elevated Prostate-specific Antigen.', 'Intra- and interreader reproducibility of PI-RADSv2: A multireader study.', 'Multiparametric MRI in detection and staging of prostate cancer.', 'Prostate cancer: state of the art imaging and focal treatment.', 'Automated Patient-level Prostate Cancer Detection with Quantitative Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging.', 'A Prospective Pilot Study Investigating Performance of 18F-Fluciclovine PET Imaging for Detection of Prostate Cancer 2 Years Following Primary Partial Gland Cryoablation.', ""Minimally Invasive Procedures in the Diagnosis and Treatment of Localized Prostate Cancer: an Interventional Radiologist's Perspective."", 'Focal therapy, time to join the multi-disciplinary team discussion?', 'Magnetic resonance imaging of the prostate after focal therapy with high-intensity focused ultrasound.']"""

Here we conducted serial measurements of PSMA expression on circulating tumor cells (CTCs) to evaluate patterns of longitudinal PSMA dynamics over the course of multiple sequential therapies.  Methods:   A retrospective investigation of men with mCRPC undergoing evaluation at medical oncology clinics at our institution assessed the dynamics of PSMA expression in the context of different systemic treatments administered sequentially. Eligibility included patients who began systemic therapies with androgen receptor (AR)-directed agents or taxane agents for whom peripheral blood samples were tested for CTC mRNA of AR splice variant-7 (AR-V7), prostate-specific antigen (PSA), and PSMA (with >2 CTC + results) in a CLIA-accredited laboratory.  Results:   From August 2015 to November 2017, we identified 96 eligible men. Fifteen had greater than or equal to 2 sequential therapies and evaluable CTC samples, greater than or equal to 1 expressing PSMA (PSMA+). Among the 15 patients included in this analysis, a total of 54 PSMA status evaluations were performed in the context of 48 therapies during a median follow-up of 18 months. At baseline, PSMA signal was detected (""positive"") in 11 of 15 (73.3%) patients, while for 4 of 15 (26.7%) patients PSMA signal was undetectable (""negative""). In all but two patients, the baseline collection corresponded with a change in treatment. On the second assessment, PSMA increases were detected in all 4/4 (100%) PSMA-negative patients and 8 of 11 (72.7%) PSMA-positive patients. PSMA significantly decreased in a patient treated with 177 Lu-PSMA-617. Serum PSA declines were seen in 7 of 8 (88%) of the treatment periods where PSMA decreased.  Conclusions:   PSMA expression in CTCs is a dynamic marker. PSMA transcript declines appear to be associated with concurrent decreases in serum PSA. Sequential CTC sampling could provide a noninvasive response assessment to systemic treatment for mCRPC.""","""['Channing J Paller', 'Danilo Piana', 'James R Eshleman', 'Stacy Riel', 'Samuel R Denmeade', 'Pedro Isaacsson Velho', 'Steven P Rowe', 'Martin G Pomper', 'Emmanuel S Antonarakis', 'Jun Luo', 'Mario A Eisenberger']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Molecular analysis of circulating tumor cells of metastatic castration-resistant Prostate Cancer Patients receiving 177Lu-PSMA-617 Radioligand Therapy.', '177LuLu-PSMA-617 versus cabazitaxel in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (TheraP): a randomised, open-label, phase 2 trial.', 'Association of AR-V7 on Circulating Tumor Cells as a Treatment-Specific Biomarker With Outcomes and Survival in Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Efficacy Against Human Prostate Cancer by Prostate-specific Membrane Antigen-specific, Transforming Growth Factor-β Insensitive Genetically Targeted CD8+ T-cells Derived from Patients with Metastatic Castrate-resistant Disease.', 'PSMA-targeted radioligand therapy in prostate cancer.', '177Lu-PSMA Therapy for Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer: A Mini-Review of State-of-the-Art.', 'Bridging the Gaps between Circulating Tumor Cells and DNA Methylation in Prostate Cancer.', 'Integrated Therapeutic Targeting of the Prostate Tumor Microenvironment.', 'Antihormone treatment differentially regulates PSA secretion, PSMA expression and 68Ga-PSMA uptake in LNCaP cells.', 'Prognostic Significance of Gene Expression and DNA Methylation Markers in Circulating Tumor Cells and Paired Plasma Derived Exosomes in Metastatic Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer.']"""

ROS cause oxidative damage to biomolecules, such as lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids, resulting in the formation of toxic and mutagenic intermediates. Lipid peroxidation (LPO) products covalently adduct to DNA and can lead to mutations. The levels of LPO DNA adducts reported in humans range widely. However, a large proportion of the DNA adducts may be attributed to artifact formation during the steps of isolation and nuclease digestion of DNA. We established a method that mitigates artifacts for most LPO adducts during the processing of DNA. We have applied this methodology to measure LPO DNA adducts in the genome of prostate cancer patients, employing ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography electrospray ionization ion trap multistage mass spectrometry. Our preliminary data show that DNA adducts of acrolein, 6-hydroxy-1,N2-propano-2'-deoxyguanosine (6-OH-PdG) and 8-hydroxy-1,N2-propano-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OH-PdG) (4-20 adducts per 107 nucleotides) are more prominent than etheno (ε) adducts (<0.5 adducts per 108 nucleotides).

Unconditional logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals for the association between night-shift work and prostate cancer, adjusting for age, ancestry, and education. No association was found between overall prostate cancer and night-shift work metrics, including ever exposure, duration, intensity, cumulative exposure, rotating shifts, and early-morning shifts. For none of the exposure indices was there evidence of heterogeneity in odds ratios between low- and high-grade cancers.

RNA-sequencing analyses identified a robust enrichment of the signature genes for human prostatic basal cell carcinomas in the above prostate tumors. Master regulator analysis revealed SOX2 as a transcriptional regulator in prostatic basal cell tumors. Elevated expression of SOX2 and its downstream target genes were detected in prostatic tumors of the compound mice. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses implicate a coregulatory role of AR and SOX2 in the expression of prostatic basal cell signature genes.

However, the genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic relationship between conventional urothelial and synchronous sarcomatoid morphology is poorly defined.  Methods:   We compiled a cohort of 21 MIBC patients with components of conventional urothelial and adjacent sarcomatoid morphology within the same tumor focus. We performed comprehensive pathologic and immunohistochemical characterization and in 4 selected cases, subjected both morphologic components to targeted DNA sequencing and whole transcriptome analysis.  Results:   Synchronous sarcomatoid and urothelial morphology from the same MIBC foci shared truncal somatic mutations, indicating a common ancestral clone. However, additional mutations or copy number alterations restricted to the either component suggested divergent evolution at the genomic level. This was confirmed at the transcriptome level since while the urothelial component exhibited a basal-like subtype (TCGA2014: cluster III, LundTax: basal/squamous-like), the sarcomatoid morphology was predominantly cluster IV (claudin-low). Protein expression was consistent with a basal-like phenotype in both morphologies in 18/21 of cases. However, most cases had evidence of active epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (E-Cad ↓ and Zeb1 or TWIST1 ↑) from urothelial toward the sarcomatoid morphology. Drug response signatures nominated different targets for each morphology and proposed agents under clinical investigation in liposarcoma or other sarcoma. PD-L1 expression was higher in the sarcomatoid than the urothelial component.  Conclusions:   Conventional urothelial and adjacent sarcomatoid morphologies of MIBC arise from the same common ancestor and share a basal-like phenotype.

Exercise outcomes align with traditionally masculine values, can improve mental and physical health, and may even slow early stage prostate cancer progression. However, attitudes and preferences towards exercise and exercise support are unexplored in men on active surveillance.  Methods:   Semi-structured qualitative interviews were conducted with participants (13 males with a history of active surveillance for prostate cancer; 5 female partners). Interviews were conducted either by telephone or in person and audiotaped, transcribed verbatim, and thematically analysed.  Results:   Several key themes were identified relating to the two research aims: 'Attitudes and Preferences towards Exercise, and 'Attitudes and Preferences towards Exercise Support'. Despite all men engaging in exercise, the majority did not meet the recommended guidelines for cancer survivors. The majority of men either were interested in receiving exercise support or had previously received it, often recommending this for all men on active surveillance. There were varied preferences regarding delivery modality (i.e., online or face to face), the inclusion of partners, and group versus individual formats.  Conclusions:   This study provides a novel insight into the attitudes and preferences of men on active surveillance regarding exercise and support. This research will help the development of acceptable and accessible person-centred support for men on active surveillance.

However, the rapid detection methods for sarcosine are relatively lack because of the low concentration and the presence of complicated interfering substances in serum or urine. In this manuscript, hollow nanospheres of Fe3O4 was synthesized and used as carrier to disperse Pt (Pt) nanoparticles. In order to achieve excellent electron transfer ability, we use polyaniline to coat Pt-Fe3O4 nanoparticles, and pyrolyze the polyaniline to carbon (C). Thus, hollow magnetic Pt-Fe3O4@C nanocomposites with good electron transfer ability are formed. The Pt-Fe3O4@C nanocomposites have high catalytic activity and stability. The nanocomposites were immobilized on glassy carbon electrode (GCE) to construct a nonenzyme hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) sensor (Pt-Fe3O4@C/GCE). We further construct a sensitive sarcosine biosensor by immobilizing sarcosine oxidase (SOx) on the Pt-Fe3O4@C/GCE. The high catalytic activity and good biocompatibility of Pt-Fe3O4@C nanocomposites greatly retained the bioactivity of immobilized SOx, and the prepared sarcosine biosensor has good electrocatalytic performance towards sarcosine. It has a linear detection range between 0.5 and 60 μM with a limit of detection (LOD) of 0.43 μM (the signal to noise ratio is 3), and the sensitivity is 3.45 nA μM-1 (48.8 nA μM-1 cm-2), which has the potential to be used for rapid screening of prostate cancer.""","""['Qingui Yang', 'Na Li', 'Qiang Li', 'Shaoqing Chen', 'Hsing-Lin Wang', 'Haipeng Yang']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Anal Chim Acta""","""['A Ti3 C2 TX /Pt-Pd based amperometric biosensor for sensitive cancer biomarker detection.', 'Amperometric hydrogen peroxide and glucose biosensor based on NiFe2/ordered mesoporous carbon nanocomposites.', 'A novel electrochemical biosensor based on Fe3O4 nanoparticles-polyvinyl alcohol composite for sensitive detection of glucose.', 'Recent progress of heterostructure-based photoelectrodes in photoelectrochemical biosensing: a mini review.', 'Quantitative analysis of sarcosine with special emphasis on biosensors: a review.', 'Nanozymes towards Personalized Diagnostics: A Recent Progress in Biosensing.', 'A Short Review on Miniaturized Biosensors for the Detection of Nucleic Acid Biomarkers.', 'Amperometric Miniaturised Portable Enzymatic Nanobiosensor for the Ultrasensitive Analysis of a Prostate Cancer Biomarker.', 'Recent Advances in Microfluidics-Based Electrochemical Sensors for Foodborne Pathogen Detection.', 'Recent Advancements in Nanobiosensors: Current Trends, Challenges, Applications, and Future Scope.']"""

In this study, we intended to further elucidate its role in endometrial cancer.  Methods:   For this purpose, we knocked down ERβ expression in two endometrial cancer cell lines, the ERα-negative/ERβ-positive line HEC-1A and the ERα/β-positive cell line RL95/2, by means of siRNA transfection. Cell proliferation after transfection was assessed using the fluorescent CTB Assay (Promega). In order to elucidate possible molecular mechanisms which might underlie the effect on proliferation, we performed transcriptome analyses by means of human Affymetrix Human Gene Chip 2.0. Additionally, we treated the employed cell lines with different ERβ modulators to examine their effect on proliferation.  Results:   siRNA-mediated knockdown of ERβ significantly increased proliferation of both endometrial cancer cell lines. In HEC-1A cells, proliferation was significantly increased 4, 5 and 6 days after transfection, with a maximum of about 1.7-fold (p < 0.05) on day 6. Endometrial RL95/2 cells with an ERβ knockdown exhibited a clearly enhanced proliferation on day 3 and days 4 to 8, when even 2.4-fold higher numbers of viable cells were detected (p < 0.01). Transcriptome analysis revealed that this was accompanied by increased expression of several genes being known to be upregulated in cancer, including proliferation-associated genes and oncogenes, and by repression of genes associated with differentiation, apoptosis or growth inhibition. Corroborating the observed knockdown effects, treatment with the ERβ antagonists PHTTP and (R, R) THC was also able to induce proliferation of both cell lines.  Conclusions:   Our data clearly support the putative role of ERβ as tumor suppressor in endometrium as previously suggested in studies on other tissues and encourage further studies to find out to what extent this molecule might be a potential therapy target in this cancer entity.""","""['Oliver Treeck', 'Elisabeth Diepolder', 'Maciej Skrzypczak', 'Susanne Schüler-Toprak', 'Olaf Ortmann']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""BMC Cancer""","""['Long non-coding RNA CCAT1 is overexpressed in endometrial cancer and regulates growth and transcriptome of endometrial adenocarcinoma cells.', 'Estrogen receptor β transcript variants associate with oncogene expression in endometrial cancer.', 'Effect of estrogen receptor β agonists on proliferation and gene expression of ovarian cancer cells.', 'Estrogen receptor β: the guardian of the endometrium.', 'Endometrial\xa0cancer and its cell lines.', 'Bisphenol S Increases Cell Number and Stimulates Migration of Endometrial Epithelial Cells.', 'Estradiol mediates the interaction of LINC01541 and miR-429 to promote angiogenesis of G1/G2 endometrioid adenocarcinoma in-vitro: A pilot study.', 'Estrogen Receptors-Mediated Apoptosis in Hormone-Dependent Cancers.', 'BAG2-Mediated Inhibition of CHIP Expression and Overexpression of MDM2 Contribute to the Initiation of Endometriosis by Modulating Estrogen Receptor Status.', 'Estrogen Receptors Alpha and Beta in Acute Myeloid Leukemia.']"""

Due to their lipophilic properties, they may accumulate in adipose tissue which could therefore be a suitable matrix to assess long-term exposure to these compounds and relationships with the tumorigenesis of these cancers. An LC-MS/MS assay for the determination of BPA and Clx-BPA in adipose tissue samples was developed and fully validated according to current bioanalytical validation guidelines. Ionization was achieved using an electrospray source operating in the negative mode and quantification of target analytes was obtained in the multiple reaction monitoring mode. Both standard and quality control (QC) samples were prepared in blank adipose tissue samples. Linearity was demonstrated over the ranges 0.125 to 8.000 and 0.0125-0.8000 ng/mL for BPA and Clx-BPA, respectively. Accuracy and precision were demonstrated over the whole concentration range: intra and inter-day bias values were in the 85-114% range and imprecision of the method did not exceed 14%. Lower limits of quantification were validated using QCs at 0.1250 and 0.0125 ng/mL for BPA and Clx-BPA, respectively.

Inguinal sentinel LN (SLN) dissection (sLND) using radioactive marking is recommended by the European Association of Urology guidelines to evaluate the nodal status in clinically node-negative penile cancer (cN0; ≥pT1, G2). Dependence on radioisotopes limits the application of this procedure to small parts of the developed world, and imposes restrictions on hospital logistics. To overcome these issues, SLN visualization using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetometer-guided detection after intraprostatic injection of superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPION) has been successfully applied in prostate cancer. Here, we present the first results of magnetic sLND in penile cancer. After peritumoral SPION injection, MR SLN imaging and magnetometer-guided sLND were performed in one cN0 penile cancer patient. Another patient underwent magnetometer-guided sLND only. In the first case, 5 SLNs could be visualized on MRI and intraoperatively detected by magnetometer-guided sLND. In the second patient, 3 SLNs could be detected by magnetic sLND. Neither patient exhibited adverse events attributable to SPION-injection. In conclusion, SPION-guided SLN identification using MRI and a handheld magnetometer is feasible and could provide a radiation-free technique for SLN identification in penile cancer.

Methods:   We assessed the mRNA expression level of TMC5 in PCa with public database the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Oncomine. The biological functions were demonstrated by bioinformatics methods and siRNA mediated knockdown experiments. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), immunohistochemical (IHC) experiments and microarray analysis were performed to confirm the results.  Results:   TMC5 expression level was significantly up-regulated in 4 independent PCa cohorts compared to normal group. Moreover, TMC5 has higher diagnostic efficiency than PSA-KLK3 (AUC (Area Under Curve) = 0.772, P < 0.001). The high expression of TMC5 was associated with clinical Gleason score, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level, androgen receptor (AR) activity score and the genes which were known frequently mutated in PCa progression (P < 0.05). Functionally, Gene Otology (GO) analysis suggested that TMC5 was related to cell development; TMC5 knockdown significantly inhibited PCa cells proliferation by arresting cell cycle at G1 phase. Drug sensitivity experiments showed TMC5 knockdown significantly enhanced cells sensitivity to 5-Fluorouracil. Microarray analysis showed TMC5 knockdown significantly inhibited cell cycle and tumor progression.

Therefore, we aimed to evaluate the performance of the PHI in predicting prostate cancer (PCa) compared with standard prostate-specific antigen (PSA) tests.  Methods:   We prospectively enrolled patients with suspected PCa with a total PSA (tPSA) level 4 to 10 ng/mL or tPSA <4 ng/mL and a suspicious digital rectal examination between February 2017 and September 2018. All of the patients underwent a 12-core transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy. Prebiopsy blood samples were analyzed for tPSA, free PSA (fPSA), percentage of fPSA (%fPSA), [-2]proPSA (p2PSA), and percentage of p2PSA (%p2PSA). The PHI was calculated as (p2PSA/fPSA) × √tPSA. The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUCs) were estimated for the PSA derivatives in addition to their specificities at a prespecified sensitivity of 90%.  Results:   Of the 307 enrolled patients, 95 (30.9%) had PCa on biopsy. Excluding fPSA, all of the PSA derivatives were significantly different between the positive and negative biopsy groups. Of the various derivatives, the PHI (AUC: 0.783) showed the best performance in predicting the results of the initial biopsy compared with tPSA (AUC: 0.611). At a sensitivity of 90%, the PHI had the best specificity of 46.7% compared with 23.2% for tPSA. Using a PHI cutoff value of 35.15 for biopsy, 108 (35.2%) patients could have avoided undergoing a biopsy. To detect Gleason score ≥ 7 disease at 90% sensitivity, the threshold for PHI was 36.96 with a specificity of 52.1%.

Methods: In vivo mpMRI was acquired from six patients prior to radical prostatectomy. Sequences included T2 weighted (T2W) imaging, diffusion-weighted imaging, dynamic contrast enhanced MRI and blood oxygen-level dependent imaging. Imaging data were co-registered with histology using three-dimensional deformable registration methods. Texture features were extracted from T2W images and parametric maps from functional MRI. Full transcriptome genetic profiles were obtained using next generation sequencing from the prostate specimens. Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated between mpMRI data and hypoxia-related gene expression levels. Results were validated using glucose transporter one immunohistochemistry (IHC).  Results:   Correlation analysis identified 34 candidate imaging features (six from the mpMRI data and 28 from T2W texture features). The IHC validation showed that 16 out of the 28 T2W texture features achieved weak but significant correlations (p < 0.05).  Conclusions:   Weak associations between mpMRI features and hypoxia gene expressions were found. This indicates the potential use of MRI in assessing hypoxia status in prostate cancer.

To identify the limitations of these methods and improve the efficiency of fusion biopsy of the prostate in a further clinical trial.  Materials and methods:   search was carried out in the PubMed, Medline, Web of Science and eLibrary databases using following requests: (prostate cancer OR prostate adenocarcinoma) AND (MRI or magnetic resonance) AND (targeted biopsy); (prostate cancer OR prostate adenocarcinoma) AND (PHS OR Histoscanning) AND (targeted biopsy) and (prostate cancer OR prostate adenocarcinoma) AND (MRI or magnetic resonance) AND (targeted biopsy) AND (cognitive registration), targeted prostate biopsy, prostate histoscanning, histoscanning, cognitive prostate biopsy.  Results:   a total of 672 publications were found, of which 25 original scientific papers were included in the analysis (n=4634). According to the results, PCa detection rate in patients with an average age of 62.5 years. (48-75) and an average PSA of 6.3 ng/ml (4.1-10.8), who underwent cognitive fusion biopsy under MRI control (MR-fusion) was 32.5%, compared to 30% and 35% for histoscanning in combination with a systematic biopsy and combination of methods (MR-fusion biopsy and histoscanning-guided biopsy), respectively. The accuracy of cognitive MR-fusion biopsy was 49.8% (20.8%-82%), the accuracy of the software MR-fusion biopsy was 52.5% (26.5%-69.7%), the accuracy of histoscanning-guided targeted biopsy was 46.8% (26%-75.8%). The highest values were observed in the patients undergoing primary biopsy (75.8%).  Discussion:   Currently, imaging methods allow us to change the approach to the diagnosis of PCa by improving the efficiency of prostate biopsy, the only formal method for verifying PCa. A common method for PCa diagnosis in 2018 is a systematic prostate biopsy. However, due to the its drawbacks, fusion biopsy under control of MRI or ultrasound has being introduced into clinical practice with superior results. So far, there is a lack of sufficient scientific data to select a specific technique of the fusion biopsy of the prostate. According to the analysis, it was concluded that the incidence of complications didnt increase when performing targeted biopsy in addition to the systematic protocol.  Conclusion:   The efficiency of cognitive MR-fusion biopsy is comparable to software MR-fusion biopsy. Histoscanning-guided biopsy has lower diagnostic value than MR-guided target biopsy using software.

Two different IMRT treatment plans, with prostate PTV margins of 5 and 3 mm respectively, were computed for each patient.

To characterize plan quality under each of the studied scenarios, we recorded the maximum, mean, and minimum doses and volumetric coverage for prostate, PTV, bladder, and rectum.  Results and discussions:   Calculated composite dose distributions were very similar to the original plan for all patients. The difference in maximum, mean, and minimum doses as well as volumetric coverage for the prostate, PTV, bladder, and rectum were all < 4.0% of prescription dose. Even for worst scenario cases, the results show acceptable isodose distribution, with the exception for the combination of a 3 mm PTV margin with a 5 mm position tolerance scheme.  Conclusions:   Calculated composite dose distributions show that the vast majority of dosimetric metrics agreed well with the planned dose (within 2%). With significant/detrimental deviations from the planned dose only occurring with the combination of a 3 mm PTV margin and 5 mm position tolerance, the 3 mm position tolerance strategy appears reasonable, confirming that further reducing prostate PTV margins to 3 mm is possible when using Calypso with a position tolerance of 3 mm.""","""['Hui Zhao', 'Vikren Sarkar', 'Brian Wang', 'Prema Rassiah-Szegedi', 'Martin Szegedi', 'Y Jessica Huang', 'Long Huang', 'Jonathan Tward', 'Bill Salter']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""J Appl Clin Med Phys""","""['Dosimetric effects of the prone and supine positions on image guided localized prostate cancer radiotherapy.', 'Determination of optimal PTV margin for patients receiving CBCT-guided prostate IMRT: comparative analysis based on CBCT dose calculation with four different margins.', 'Role of image-guided patient repositioning and online planning in localized prostate cancer IMRT.', 'Practical method of adaptive radiotherapy for prostate cancer using real-time electromagnetic tracking.', 'Improvement in dose escalation using the process of adaptive radiotherapy combined with three-dimensional conformal or intensity-modulated beams for prostate cancer.']"""

We downloaded a gene expression matrix and clinical information from TCGA, and CIBERSORT was used to identify the proportion of TIICs. Wilcoxon's Sign Rank Test evaluated different gene expression levels in PCa and normal tissues. Kaplan-Meier curves were used to evaluate the associations of TIICs and recurrence-free survival (RFS). Finally, based on the preset P-value of .05, the distribution of TIICs in 73 PCa tissues and 11 normal tissues was illustrated. Activated CD4+ T cells and M0 macrophages account for a high proportion in PCa tissues, while neutrophils and monocytes were found at a high density in normal tissues. Further results showed that the density of plasma cells, Treg cells and resting mast cells were associated with advanced PCa. Additionally, M2 macrophages affected the RFS of PCa patients, and AR was also involved. In the current study, we first evaluated the immune infiltration among PCa and revealed that M2 macrophages could predict the prognosis of PCa patients.

In the present study, the SP-D expression was evaluated in primary prostate epithelial cells (PrEC) and prostate cancer cell lines. LNCaP, an androgen dependent prostate cancer cell line, exhibited significantly lower mRNA and protein levels of SP-D than PrEC and the androgen independent cell lines (PC3 and DU145). A recombinant fragment of human SP-D, rfhSP-D, showed a dose and time dependent binding to prostate cancer cells via its carbohydrate recognition domain. This study, for the first time, provides evidence of significant and specific cell death of tumor cells in rfhSP-D treated explants as well as primary tumor cells isolated from tissue biopsies of metatstatic prostate cancer patients. Viability of PrEC was not altered by rfhSP-D. Treated LNCaP (p53+/+) and PC3 (p53 -/-) cells exhibited reduced cell viability in a dose and time dependent manner and were arrested in G2/M and G1/G0 phase of the cell cycle, respectively. rfhSP-D treated LNCaP cells showed a significant upregulation of p53 whereas a significant downregulation of pAkt was observed in both PC3 and LNCaP cell lines. The rfhSP-D-induced apoptosis signaling cascade involved upregulation of Bax:Bcl2 ratio, cytochrome c and cleaved products of caspase 7.

We have recently reported that the immune receptor Tim-3 and its natural ligand galectin-9 are involved in the immune escape of human acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells. These cells use the neuronal receptor latrophilin 1 (LPHN1) and its ligand fibronectin leucine rich transmembrane protein 3 (FLRT3, and possibly other ligands) to trigger the pathway. We hypothesized that the Tim-3-galectin-9 pathway may be involved in the immune escape of cancer cells of different origins. We found that studied breast tumors expressed significantly higher levels of both galectin-9 and Tim-3 compared to healthy breast tissues of the same patients and that these proteins were co-localized. Increased levels of LPHN2 and expressions of LPHN3 as well as FLRT3 were also detected in breast tumor cells. Activation of this pathway facilitated the translocation of galectin-9 onto the tumor cell surface, however no secretion of galectin-9 by tumor cells was observed. Surface-based galectin-9 was able to protect breast carcinoma cells against cytotoxic T cell-induced death. Furthermore, we found that cell lines from brain, colorectal, kidney, blood/mast cell, liver, prostate, lung, and skin cancers expressed detectable amounts of both Tim-3 and galectin-9 proteins. The majority of cell lines expressed one of the LPHN isoforms and FLRT3.

In this study, we showed the beneficial effects of casticin on the inhibition of prostate cancer cell metastasis. Casticin reduced total viable cell number, thus, we selected low doses of casticin for following experiments. Casticin decreased cell mobility, suppressed cell migration and invasion, and reduced cell gelatinolytic activities of MMP-2/-9. Furthermore, casticin inhibited the protein levels of AKT, GSK3 αβ, Snail, and MMPs (MMP-2, -9, -13, and -7) at 24 and 48 hr treatment. Casticin diminished the expressions of NF-κB p65, GRB2, SOS-1, MEK, p-ERK1/2, and p-JNK1/2 at 48 hr treatment only. However, casticin reduced the level of E-cadherin at 24 hr treatment but elevated at 48 hr. The novel findings suggest that casticin may represent a new and promising therapeutic agent for the metastatic prostate cancer. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Casticin derived from natural plants had been used for Chinese medicine in Chinese population for thousands of years. In the present study, casticin attenuated metastatic effects, including decreasing viable cell number, inhibiting the migration, invasion, and adhesion, and reducing matrix metalloproteinases activity on human prostate DU 145 cancer cells.

He had metabolic alkalosis and hypokalemia with suppressed plasma renin activity and serum aldosterone. Concurrently, he was diagnosed with small cell neuroendocrine carcinoma of the prostate gland, a rare form of prostate cancer. Despite absence of typical Cushingoid features, investigation confirmed the diagnosis of ectopic adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) syndrome from neuroendocrine prostate cancer. Because of the severity of his hypercortisolism, he underwent urgent bilateral adrenalectomy for hormonal and symptomatic control. Blood pressure improved significantly and he was dismissed with a single antihypertensive agent. Unfortunately, the patient died from his cancer 1 month later.  Conclusion:   Primary and secondary hyperaldosteronism are usually diagnosed based on measurements of aldosterone and plasma renin activity.

Making these distinctions is critical for guiding appropriate treatment and improving patient outcomes. Here we conducted one of the largest studies to date of invasive high-grade urothelial carcinoma arising in a background of urothelial carcinoma with an inverted growth pattern. Primary sites examined included bladder, renal pelvis, ureter, and prostatic urethra. Clinicopathological parameters including extent of invasion, variant histology, presence of urothelial carcinoma in situ, and clinical follow-up were obtained. Ninety-one cases from 82 patients were included in the study. Lamina propria invasion was present in 81% of bladder, 60% of ureter, 20% of renal pelvis, and 100% of prostatic urethra cases. Muscularis propria invasion was identified in 19% of bladder, 14% of ureter, and 20% of renal pelvis cases. Urothelial carcinoma invaded periureteric fat in 29% of ureter cases and invaded the renal parenchyma in 60% of renal pelvis cases. Clinical follow-up was available for 77 of 82 (94%) patients with a mean duration of 18 months. Recurrent urothelial carcinoma persisted in 63 of 82 (77%) patients, 16 of 82 (19%) progressed with metastatic disease, and 20 of 77 (26%) patients with bladder involvement died of disease. This study further emphasizes the importance of distinguishing these tumors from benign mimickers of urothelial carcinoma.

Patients and methods:   Data of all patients undergoing AUS implantation with a distal bulbar DC (DC-AUS) were collected prospectively from 2009 to 2015. Indications for DC implantation were based on urethral risk factors in terms of RT and previous proximal bulbar urethral interventions including, endoscopic or open surgery for urethral stricture or SUI. Implantation was carried out to a standardised protocol. Activation of the AUS was performed 6 weeks after implantation. Further follow-up (FU) included pad test, uroflowmetry, post-void residual urine measurements, radiography, and a standardised questionnaire. Continence and complication rates were compared between patients with a history of RT and non-RT patients. Explantation-free survival was estimated using Kaplan-Meier curves and the log-rank test. Firth's penalized Cox-regression analyses were performed to analyse proportional hazard ratios for explantation.  Results:   In all, 150 men (median age 70 years, interquartile range [IQR] 66-74) after DC-AUS implantation were available for analysis. Overall, 73 men (48.7%) had a history of RT. The median (IQR) FU was 24 (7.25-36) months. Baseline clinical characteristics only differed regarding previous open SUI surgery (P = 0.016). Social and objective continence was achieved in 94.8% and 84.3% of all patients treated by implantation of a DC-AUS, respectively. Between the RT and non-RT patients there were no statistically significant differences in continence rates [social continence: 100% vs 90.2% (P = 0.194); objective continence: 87% vs 82% (P = 0.877)]. For complications rates there were no significant differences between RT and non-RT patients after DC-AUS implantation [infection (P = 0.09), erosion (P = 0.31), mechanical failures (P = 0.14)]. According to Kaplan-Meier analysis explantation rates in patients with a history of RT (26.0%) vs non-RT patients (20.8%), estimated explantation-free survival, and AUS durability, did not differ significantly (log-rank P = 0.219).

This present study therefore aims to provide further clinical data in order to resolve this urgent clinical question, and thereby strengthen clinical recommendations.  Methods:   A retrospective analysis was performed for patients who were scanned at our institution with whole-body PSMA-PET/CT (tracer: 68Ga-PSMA-11) between January 2017 and September 2018 in order to detect rPC. Amongst them, 43 underwent an additional pelvic MRI within 2 months. Both modalities were compared as follows: a consensus read of the PET data was performed by two nuclear physicians. All lesions were recorded with respect to their type and localization. The same process was conducted by two radiologists for pelvic MRI. Thereafter, both modalities were directly compared for every patient and lesion.  Results:   Overall, 30/43 patients (69.8%) presented with a pathologic MRI and 38/43 (88.4%) with a pathologic PSMA-PET/CT of the pelvis. MRI detected 53 pelvic rPC lesions (13 of them classified as ""uncertain"") and PSMA-PET/CT detected 75 pelvic lesions (three classified as ""uncertain""). The superiority of PSMA-PET/CT was statistically significant only if uncertain lesions were classified as false-positive.  Conclusions:   PSMA-PET/CT detected more pelvic lesions characteristic for rPC when compared to MRI. In order to detect rPC, a potential future scenario could be conducting first a PSMA-PET/CT.

Regular and continued drug use (persistence) is a precondition of clinical efficacy; persistence in real-life is yet undetermined for denosumab.  Methods:   This was a single-arm, prospective, observational, non-interventional study in 598 patients with bone metastases from breast, prostate, lung, or other solid tumors treated with denosumab every four weeks in real-world clinical practice in Austria, Czech Republic, Hungary, Slovakia, and Bulgaria. Persistence was defined as denosumab administration at ≤ 35-day intervals over 24 or 48 weeks, respectively.  Results:   Previous SREs were found in 10.9% of patients. 62.6% were persistent over 24 weeks and 40.1% over 48 weeks. The Kaplan-Meier median (95% CI) time to non-persistence was 274.0 days (232.0, 316.0). The most frequent reason for non-persistence was delayed administration. There was a trend towards weaker analgesics over time, with approximately 60% of patients not requiring any analgesics. Serum calcium remained within the normal range throughout the study.

Methods: A Markov model of prostate cancer onset and progression was used to estimate the health and economic consequences of 18F-choline PET/mpMRI for the detection of primary prostate cancer with a Gleason score of greater than or equal to 3 + 4 in men with elevated prostate-specific antigen levels. Multiple simultaneous hybrid 18F-choline PET/mpMRI strategies were evaluated using Likert or Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System version 2 (PI-RADSv2) scoring; the first was biopsy for Likert 5 mpMRI lesions or Likert 3-4 lesions with 18F-choline target-to-background ratios of greater than or equal to 1.58, and the second was biopsy for PI-RADSv2 5 mpMRI lesions or PI-RADSv2 3-4 mpMRI lesions with 18F-choline target-to-background ratios of greater than or equal to 1.58. These strategies were compared with universal standard biopsy, mpMRI alone with biopsy only for PI-RADSv2 3-5 lesions, and mpMRI alone with biopsy only for Likert 4-5 lesions. For each mpMRI strategy, either no biopsy or standard biopsy could be performed after negative mpMRI results were obtained. Deaths averted, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), cost, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were estimated for each strategy. Results: When the results of 18F-choline PET/mpMRI were negative, performing a standard biopsy was more expensive and had lower QALYs than performing no biopsy. The best screening strategy among those considered in this study performed hybrid 18F-choline PET/mpMRI with Likert scoring on men with elevated PSA, performed combined biopsy (targeted biopsy and standard 12-core biopsy) for men with positive imaging results, and no biopsy for men with negative imaging results ($22,706/QALY gained relative to mpMRI alone); this strategy reduced the number of biopsies by 35% in comparison to mpMRI alone. When the same policies were compared using PI-RADSv2 instead of Likert scoring, hybrid 18F-choline PET/mpMRI cost $46,867/QALY gained relative to mpMRI alone. In a threshold analysis, the best strategy among those considered remained cost-effective when the sensitivity and specificity of PET/mpMRI and combined biopsy (targeted biopsy and standard 12-core biopsy) were simultaneously reduced by 20 percentage points.

Patients and method:   A descriptive study was conducted over the period from 1 January 2008 to 31 December 2017 in the General Surgery Department of the Tenkodogo Regional Hospital, located in the east of Burkina Faso. All patients over 15 years of age who were diagnosed with primary urological cancer were included.  Results:   A total of 160 patients were included. One hundred and thirty-one patients were male (81.9%). The sex ratio was 4.5. The average age of the patients was 58.9 years (standard deviation: 18 years). We found 73 cases of prostate cancers (45.6%), 53 bladder cancers (33.1%), 17 kidney cancers (10.6%), 11 testicular cancers (6.9%) and 6 cancers of the male external genitalia (3.7%). The histological types of prostate cancer were adenocarcinoma (88%) and neuroendocrine carcinoma (12%). Thirty-seven prostate cancers (50.7%) were diagnosed at the T3 stage and 12 others (16.4%) at the T4 stage. Prostate cancer treatment was only medical in 23 patients; surgical treatment was indicated in 50 other patients. The 5-year survival was 85%. Sixteen patients (30.2%) had metastatic bladder cancer at the time of diagnosis. The treatment of vesical cancers has been palliative in 50 cases.""","""['Souleymane Ouedraogo', 'Mamadou T Traore', 'Jean L Kambire', 'Salam Ouedraogo', 'Bernadette Bere', 'Aristide F Kabore']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Bull Cancer""","""['Epidemiological, clinical, histological and therapeutic features of primary digestive cancers in Burkina Faso.', 'Survey of incidence of urological cancer in South Korea: a 15-year summary.', 'De novo urological neoplasms in kidney transplant patients: experience in 1,751 patients.', 'Role of C-reactive protein in urological cancers: a useful biomarker for predicting outcomes.', 'Multiple urologic tumors in autopsy material.']"""

The Gene Master Regulators (GMRs) were defined as genes whose highly controlled expression by the homeostatic mechanisms commands the cell phenotype by modulating major functional pathways through expression correlation with their genes. The Gene Commanding Height (GCH), a measure that combines the expression control and expression correlation with all other genes, is used to establish the gene hierarchy in each cell phenotype. We developed the experimental protocol, the mathematical algorithm and the computer software to identify the GMRs from transcriptomic data in surgically removed tumors, biopsies or blood from cancer patients. The GMR approach is illustrated with applications to our microarray data on human kidney, thyroid and prostate cancer samples, and on thyroid, prostate and blood cancer cell lines. We proved experimentally that each patient has his/her own GMRs, that cancer nuclei and surrounding normal tissue are governed by different GMRs, and that manipulating the expression has larger consequences for genes with higher GCH. Therefore, we launch the hypothesis that silencing the GMR may selectively kill the cancer cells from a tissue.""","""['Sanda Iacobas', 'Nneka Ede', 'Dumitru A Iacobas']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Genes (Basel)""","""['Personalized 3-Gene Panel for Prostate Cancer Target Therapy.', 'Gene master regulators of papillary and anaplastic thyroid cancers.', 'Powerful quantifiers for cancer transcriptomics.', 'A Personalized Genomics Approach of the Prostate Cancer.', 'Long noncoding RNA in prostate, bladder, and kidney cancer.', 'Genome-wide characterization leading to simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers development in Shorea robusta.', 'Theory and Applications of the (Cardio) Genomic Fabric Approach to Post-Ischemic and Hypoxia-Induced Heart Failure.', 'Personalized 3-Gene Panel for Prostate Cancer Target Therapy.', 'PPAR-γ activation enhances myelination and neurological recovery in premature rabbits with intraventricular hemorrhage.', 'TWEAKing the Hippocampus: The Effects of TWEAK on the Genomic Fabric of the Hippocampus in a Neuropsychiatric Lupus Mouse Model.']"""

Elemental analyses, IR spectra, X-ray diffraction analysis and thermal analysis studies have been used to confirm the structure of the prepared polymer complexes. The chemical structure of metal chelates commensurate that the ligand acts as a neutral bis(bidentate) by through four sites of coordination (azo dye nitrogen, carbonyl oxygen, phenolic oxygen and hetero nitrogen from pyridine ring). The molecular and electronic structures of the hydrogen bond conformers of HL ligand were optimized theoretically and the quantum chemical parameters were calculated. Elemental analysis data suggested that the polymer complexes have composition of octahedral geometry for all the polymer complexes. Molecular docking of the binding between HL and the receptors of prostate cancer (PDB code 2Q7L Hormone) and the breast cancer (PDB code 1JNX Gene regulation) was studied. The interaction between HL and its polymer complexes with the calf thymus DNA (CT-DNA) was determined by absorption spectra. The antimicrobial activity of HL and its Cu2+, Co2+, Ni2+ and UO22+ polymer complexes were investigated; only Cu(II) polymer complex (1) was specifically active against Aspergillus niger. It inhibited the fungal sporulation and distorted the fungal mycelia, which became squashed at a concentration of 150 μg/ml; transmission electron microscope (TEM) also showed a deactivation of autophagy in the treated A. niger cells via accumulation of autophagic bodies in vacuoles. The inhibition process of the prepared ligand (HL) against the corrosion of carbon steel in 2 M HCl solution was determined by various methods (weight loss, potentiodynamic polarization, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and electrochemical frequency modulation (EFM) techniques) are found to be in reasonable agreement.
