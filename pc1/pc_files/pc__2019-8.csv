The objective of this study was to determine whether serum gastrokine 1 (GKN1) protein is a gastric cancer-specific diagnostic biomarker. The serum concentration of GKN1 in healthy individuals (median: 6.34 ng/μL, interquartile range (IQR): 5.66-7.54 ng/μL) was significantly higher compared with the levels in gastric cancer patients (median: 3.48 ng/μL, IQR: 2.90-4.11 ng/μL; P < .0001). At the optimum cutoff (4.94 ng/μL) of serum GKN1 protein, the sensitivity and specificity were 91.2% and 96.0%, respectively, for gastric cancer. Using serum GKN1 protein as the diagnostic reference, the ROC curve showed a satisfactory diagnostic efficacy with an AUC value of 0.9954 (95% CI 0.9919-0.9988) and Youden index of 0.8740. In addition, the diagnostic accuracy of the serum GKN1 protein at the optimum cutoff was 0.9675. Interestingly, serum GKN1 concentrations in patients with advanced gastric cancer (AGC; median: 3.11 ng/μL, IQR: 2.72-3.72 ng/μL) were lower than in patients with early gastric cancer (EGC; median: 4.31 ng/μL, IQR: 3.88-4.88 ng/μL). The diagnostic accuracies at the optimum serum GKN1 cutoff were 0.8912 and 0.9589 for EGC and AGC, respectively. Furthermore, the serum GKN1 concentrations robustly discriminated the patients with gastric cancer from the patients with colorectal, liver, lung, breast, pancreatic, ovary, and prostatic cancers with AUC values greater than 0.94. These data suggest that serum GKN1 is a promising and highly specific diagnostic biomarker for the prompt detection of early and advanced gastric cancers.""","""['Jung Hwan Yoon', 'Yong Gyu Park', 'Suk Woo Nam', 'Won Sang Park']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Cancer Med""","""['Gastrokine 1 protein is a potential theragnostic target for gastric cancer.', 'Gastrokine 1 inhibits gastric cancer cell migration and invasion by downregulating RhoA expression.', 'Epigenetic alterations of gastrokine 1 gene expression in gastric cancer.', 'Regulation of GKN1 expression in gastric carcinogenesis: A problem to resolve (Review).', 'The role and diagnostic potential of gastrokine 1 in gastric cancer.', 'Biomarkers of gastric cancer: current advancement.', 'The updated role of exosomal proteins in the diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of cancer.', 'Research progress on exosomal proteins as diagnostic markers of gastric cancer (review article).', 'Identifying Novel Biomarkers Ready for Evaluation in Low-Prevalence Populations for the Early Detection of Upper Gastrointestinal Cancers: A Systematic Review.', 'Diagnostic and prognostic value of the peripheral natural killer cell levels in gastric cancer.']"""

The objective of this study was to evaluate the grade groups of an African Caribbean cohort, newly diagnosed with PCa on prostate biopsy, compared with a Caucasian French Metropolitan cohort.  Methods:   A retrospective, a comparative study was conducted between 2008 and 2016 between the University Hospital of Martinique in the French Caribbean West Indies, and the Saint Joseph Hospital in Paris. Clinical, biological, and pathological data were collected at diagnosis. The primary outcome was the grade groups for Gleason score; the secondary outcome was the PCa detection rate. Multivariate analysis was performed using linear regression.  Results:   Of the 1880 consecutive prostate biopsy performed in the African Caribbean cohort, 945 had a diagnosis of PCa (50.3%) and 500 of 945 in the French cohort (33.8%). African Caribbean patients were older (mean 68.5 vs 67.5 years; P = .028), had worse clinical stage (13.2% vs 5.2% cT3-4; P < .001) and higher median prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level (9.23 vs 8.32 ng/mL; P = .019).

Tumors that have escaped systemic androgen deprivation, castration-resistant prostate cancers (CRPC), have measurable intratumoral levels of testosterone, suggesting that a resistance mechanism still depends on androgen-simulated growth. However, AR activation requires an optimal intracellular concentration of androgens, a situation challenged by low circulating testosterone concentrations. Notably, PC cells may optimize their androgen levels by regulating the expression of steroid metabolism enzymes that convert androgen precursors into androgens. Here we propose that testosterone entry into the cell could be another control point.  Methods:   To determine whether testosterone enters cells via a transporter, we performed in vitro 3 H-testosterone uptake assays in androgen-dependent LNCaP and androgen and AR-independent PC3 cells. To determine if the uptake mechanism depended on a concentration gradient, we modified UGT2B17 levels in LNCaP cells and measured androgen levels by liquid-liquid extraction-mass spectrometry. We also analyzed CRPC metastases for expression of AKR1C3 to determine whether this enzyme that converts adrenal androgens to testosterone was present in the tumor stroma (microenvironment) in addition to its expression in the tumor epithelium.  Results:   Testosterone uptake followed a concentration gradient but unlike in passive diffusion, was saturable and temperature-dependent, thus suggesting facilitated transport. Suppression of UGT2B17 to abrogate a testosterone gradient reduced testosterone transport while overexpression of the enzyme enhanced it. The facilitated transport suggests a paracrine route of testosterone uptake for maintaining optimal intracellular levels. We found that AKR1C3 was expressed in the tumor microenvironment of CRPC metastases in addition to epithelial cells and the pattern of relative abundance of the enzyme in epithelium vs stroma varied substantially between the metastatic sites.  Conclusions:   Our findings suggest that in addition to testosterone transport and metabolism by tumor epithelium, testosterone could also be produced by components of the tumor microenvironment. Facilitated testosterone uptake by tumor cells supports a cell nonautonomous mechanism for testosterone signaling in CRPC.""","""['Arja Kaipainen', 'Ailin Zhang', 'Rui M Gil da Costa', 'Jared Lucas', 'Brett Marck', 'Alvin M Matsumoto', 'Colm Morrissey', 'Lawrence D True', 'Elahe A Mostaghel', 'Peter S Nelson']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Differential Expression of OATP1B3 Mediates Unconjugated Testosterone Influx.', 'Steroidogenic enzyme AKR1C3 is a novel androgen receptor-selective coactivator that promotes prostate cancer growth.', 'Paracrine sonic hedgehog signaling contributes significantly to acquired steroidogenesis in the prostate tumor microenvironment.', 'Androgen receptor-dependent and -independent mechanisms driving prostate cancer progression: Opportunities for therapeutic targeting from multiple angles.', 'Beyond T and DHT - novel steroid derivatives capable of wild type androgen receptor activation.', 'Canonical and truncated transglutaminase-2 regulate mucin-1 expression and androgen independency in prostate cancer cell lines.', 'The androgen receptor-targeted proteolysis targeting chimera and other alternative therapeutic choices in overcoming the resistance to androgen deprivation treatment in prostate cancer.', 'Transcriptomic Signature and Growth Factor Regulation of Castration-Tolerant Prostate Luminal Progenitor Cells.', 'Advances in the Current Understanding of the Mechanisms Governing the Acquisition of Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Advances in neuroendocrine prostate cancer research: From model construction to molecular network analyses.']"""

It is critical to evaluate these molecular changes to identify new biomarkers and targets. We performed analysis of glycine-N-acyltransferase like 1 (GLYATL1) expression in various stages of prostate cancer in this study and evaluated the regulation of GLYATL1 by androgen.  Method:   We performed in silico analysis of cancer gene expression profiling and transcriptome sequencing to evaluate GLYATL1 expression in prostate cancer. Furthermore, we performed immunohistochemistry using specific GLYATL1 antibody using high-density prostate cancer tissue microarray containing primary and metastatic prostate cancer. We also tested the regulation of GLYATL1 expression by androgen and ETS transcription factor ETV1. In addition, we performed RNA-sequencing of GLYATL1 modulated prostate cancer cells to evaluate the gene expression and changes in molecular pathways.  Results:   Our in silico analysis of cancer gene expression profiling and transcriptome sequencing we revealed an overexpression of GLYATL1 in primary prostate cancer. Confirming these findings by immunohistochemistry, we show that GLYATL1 is overexpressed in primary prostate cancer compared with metastatic prostate cancer and benign prostatic tissue. Low-grade cancers had higher GLYATL1 expression compared to high-grade prostate tumors. Our studies showed that GLYATL1 is upregulated upon androgen treatment in LNCaP prostate cancer cells which harbors ETV1 gene rearrangement. Furthermore, ETV1 knockdown in LNCaP cells showed downregulation of GLYATL1 suggesting potential regulation of GLYATL1 by ETS transcription factor ETV1. Transcriptome sequencing using the GLYATL1 knockdown prostate cancer cell lines LNCaP showed regulation of multiple metabolic pathways.  Conclusions:   In summary, our study characterizes the expression of GLYATL1 in prostate cancer and explores the regulation of its regulation in prostate cancer showing role for androgen and ETS transcription factor ETV1.

Materials and methods:   A total of 449 patients with NEPC, including 352 cases of pure NEPC and 97 cases of NE differentiation, together with 408 629 cases of prostate adenocarcinoma at diagnosis were retrieved from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program (2010-2015). Clinical parameters and prognoses were compared between patients with different histological types of NEPC using the χ2 test and Kaplan-Meier analysis, respectively. The prognostic value of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) in NEPC and adenocarcinoma was evaluated using Cox regression and the Kaplan-Meier method.  Results:   Pure NEPC had higher rates of visceral metastases (brain, lung, and liver: 4.58%, 26.72%, and 36.64%, respectively) but a lower rate of bone metastasis (65.65%) compared with NE differentiation and prostate adenocarcinoma.

However, few studies have investigated the extent to which it involves the prostate in the current antimicrobial era. We addressed this question by investigating the relation between T. vaginalis antibody serostatus and serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) concentration, a marker of prostate infection, inflammation, and/or cell damage, in young, male, US military members.  Methods:   We measured T. vaginalis serum IgG antibodies and serum total PSA concentration in a random sample of 732 young, male US active duty military members. Associations between T. vaginalis serostatus and PSA were investigated by linear regression.  Results:   Of the 732 participants, 341 (46.6%) had a low T. vaginalis seropositive score and 198 (27.0%) had a high score, with the remainder seronegative. No significant differences were observed in the distribution of PSA by T. vaginalis serostatus. However, slightly greater, nonsignificant differences were observed when men with high T. vaginalis seropositive scores were compared with seronegative men, and when higher PSA concentrations were examined (≥0.70 ng/mL). Specifically, 42.5% of men with high seropositive scores had a PSA concentration greater than or equal to 0.70 ng/mL compared with 33.2% of seronegative men (adjusted P = .125).  Conclusions:   Overall, our findings do not provide strong support for prostate involvement during T. vaginalis infection, although our suggestive positive findings for higher PSA concentrations do not rule out this possibility entirely.

Evidence-based clinical guidelines have stipulated its use up to 10 cycles in most health care systems. There has been a paucity of information regarding potential benefits of its use over 10 cycles. The purpose of this study is to re-examine the rationale for the clinical guidelines concerning cycles of DOC in CRPC.  Methods:   Between July 2007 and July 2016, a total of 122 CRPC patients received at least five cycles of DOC at Jikei University and its affiliate hospitals. Doses of DOC (75 mg/m 2 ) were administered every 3 to 4 weeks. Clinical outcomes between patients receiving extended cycles of DOC (≥11 cycles, extended [ex]-DOC group) were compared to those receiving fewer (≤10 cycles, short-DOC group). A subgroup of patients who had discontinued DOC owing to adverse events, but whose disease did not progress, were also considered for comparison (adverse events [AE] group). Overall survival from the induction of DOC was the primary outcome measure. Univariate and multivariate analyses were conducted to analyze variables associated with overall survival.  Results:   The ex- and short-DOC groups included 80 and 42 patients, respectively. Most baseline demographics did not differ between groups. However, in the short-DOC group more patients had received abiraterone acetate and/or enzalutamide before chemotherapy, age at DOC induction was younger, and lactate dehydrogenase at DOC induction was higher. Overall survival was significantly longer in the ex-DOC group compared to the short-DOC group (median, 53 and 27 months, respectively; P = .04). A subgroup of 22 patients in AE group was compared to compensate for potential bias. Overall survival from the induction of DOC was comparable between AE group and ex-DOC groups (median, 53 vs 53 months, respectively; P = 0.87). Univariate and multivariate analyses did not show any advantage of extended use of DOC on patient survival.  Conclusions:   The results of this study failed to show the survival benefit of extended use of DOC over 10 cycles in CRPC patients in the era of innovative drugs such as abiraterone acetate, enzalutamide, and cabazitaxel.

Some gene expression tests improve upon clinical factors for prediction of outcomes, but additional tools for accurate prediction of tumor aggressiveness are needed.  Methods:   Based on a previously published panel of 23 gene transcripts that distinguished patients with metastatic progression, we constructed a prediction model using independent training and testing datasets. Using the validated messenger RNAs and Gleason score (GS), we performed model selection in the training set to define a final locked model to classify patients who developed metastatic-lethal events from those who remained recurrence-free. In an independent testing dataset, we compared our locked model to established clinical prognostic factors and utilized Kaplan-Meier curves and receiver operating characteristic analyses to evaluate the model's performance.  Results:   Thirteen of 23 previously identified gene transcripts that stratified patients with aggressive PCa were validated in the training dataset. These biomarkers plus GS were used to develop a four-gene (CST2, FBLN1, TNFRSF19, and ZNF704) transcript (4GT) score that was significantly higher in patients who progressed to metastatic-lethal events compared to those without recurrence in the testing dataset (P = 5.7 × 10-11 ). The 4GT score provided higher prediction accuracy (area under the ROC curve [AUC] = 0.76; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.69-0.83; partial area under the ROC curve [pAUC] = 0.008) than GS alone (AUC = 0.63; 95% CI = 0.56-0.70; pAUC = 0.002), and it improved risk stratification in subgroups defined by a combination of clinicopathological features (ie, Cancer of the Prostate Risk Assessment-Surgery).

More detailed analyses showed important contrasts, particularly for mesothelioma, lung cancer, skin cancer, prostate cancer and breast cancer.  Conclusions:   A clear occupational excess of mesothelioma was not matched by a corresponding excess of asbestos-induced lung cancer.

We therefore focused on all patients with biochemical recurrence and PSA values no higher than 0.5 ng/mL to assess the detection rate for 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/MRI. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed a cohort of 66 consecutive patients who underwent 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/MRI for biochemical recurrence with a PSA value no higher than 0.5 ng/mL at our institution. Median PSA level was 0.23 ng/mL (range, 0.03-0.5 ng/mL). Detection of PSMA-positive lesions within the prostate fossa, local and distant lymph nodes, bones, or visceral organs was recorded. In addition, all scans with 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/MRI-positive lesions were retrospectively assessed to analyze if lesions were detected inside or outside a standard salvage radiotherapy volume. Results: Overall, in 36 of 66 patients (54.5%) PSMA-positive lesions were detected; in 26 of 40 (65%) patients with a PSA level between 0.2 and 0.5 ng/mL and in 10 of 26 (38.5%) patients with a PSA level less than 0.2 ng/mL. Even at those low PSA values, only 8 of 66 (12.1%) patients had exclusive local recurrence. Lymph nodes were detected in 23 patients and bone metastases in 5 on 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/MRI. In 26 of 66 patients (39.4%), PSMA-positive lesions were located outside a standard salvage radiotherapy volume. Conclusion: Our data confirm that 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/MRI has a high detection rate for recurrent prostate cancer, even at low PSA levels no higher than 0.5 ng/mL.

To the best of our knowledge, no prospective head-to-head comparison between these tests has been done so far. The aim of this study was to compare prospectively paired 18F-fluciclovine and PSMA PET-CT scans for localising biochemical recurrence of prostate cancer after radical prostatectomy in patients with low prostate-specific antigen (PSA) concentrations (<2·0 ng/mL).  Methods:   This was a prospective, single-centre, open-label, single-arm comparative study done at University of California Los Angeles (Los Angeles, CA, USA). Patients older than 18 years of age with prostate cancer biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy and PSA levels ranging from 0·2 to 2·0 ng/mL without any prior salvage therapy and with a Karnofsky performance status of at least 50 were eligible. Patients underwent 18F-fluciclovine (reference test) and PSMA (index test) PET-CT scans within 15 days. Detection rate of biochemical recurrence at the patient level and by anatomical region was the primary endpoint. A statistical power analysis demonstrated that a sample size of 50 patients was needed to show a 22% difference in detection rates in favour of PSMA (test for superiority). Each PET scan was interpreted by three independent masked readers and a consensus majority interpretation was generated (two vs one) to determine positive findings. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02940262, and is complete.  Findings:   Between Feb 26, 2018, and Sept 20, 2018, 143 patients were screened for eligibility, of whom 50 patients were enrolled into the study. Median follow-up was 8 months (IQR 7-9). The primary endpoint was met; detection rates were significantly lower with 18F-fluciclovine PET-CT (13 [26%; 95% CI 15-40] of 50) than with PSMA PET-CT (28 [56%; 41-70] of 50), with an odds ratio (OR) of 4·8 (95% CI 1·6-19·2; p=0·0026) at the patient level; in the subanalysis of the pelvic nodes region (four [8%; 2-19] with 18F-fluciclovine vs 15 [30%; 18-45] with PSMA PET-CT; OR 12·0 [1·8-513·0], p=0·0034); and in the subanalysis of any extrapelvic lesions (none [0%; 0-6] vs eight [16%; 7-29]; OR non-estimable [95% CI non-estimable], p=0·0078).  Interpretation:   With higher detection rates, PSMA should be the PET tracer of choice when PET-CT imaging is considered for subsequent treatment management decisions in patients with prostate cancer and biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy and low PSA concentrations (≤2·0 ng/mL). Further research is needed to investigate whether higher detection rates translate into improved oncological outcomes.

Design, setting, and participants:   An analysis of worldwide search-engine trends included electronic Google queries from people who searched PCa treatment options from January 2004 to August 2018, worldwide. Join-point regression was performed. Comparisons of annual relative search volume (ARSV), average annual percentage change (AAPC), and temporal patterns were analysed to assess loss or gain of interest.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Evaluations were made regarding (1) interest in PCa treatments, (2) comparison of people's interest, and (3) impact of the US Preventive Service Task Force (USPSTF) screening recommendation and National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guideline endorsements on Internet searching for PCa treatments.  Results and limitations:   The mean ARSV for ""prostatectomy"" was 73% in 2004 and decreased thereafter, reaching a nadir of 36% in 2014 (APC: -7.2%; 95% confidence interval [CI] -7.8, -6.7; p < 0.01). Similarly, decreased interest was recorded for radiation therapy (AAPC: -3.2%; p = 0.1), high-intensity focused ultrasound (AAPC: -2.3%; p = 0.1), hormonal therapy (AAPC: -11.6%; p < 0.01), ablation therapy (AAPC: -4.1%; p < 0.01), cryotherapy (AAPC: -9.9%; p < 0.01), and brachytherapy (AAPC: -8.3%; p < 0.01). A steep interest was found in active surveillance (AS) (AAPC: +14.2%; p < 0.01) and focal therapy (AAPC: +27.5%; p < 0.01). When trends were compared before and after NCCN and USPSTF recommendations, a consistent decrease of all the treatment options was found, while interest in focal therapy and AS showed an augmented mean ARSV (+19.6 and +31.6, respectively).  Conclusions:   People are increasingly searching the Internet for PCa treatment options. A parallel decrease of interest was found for the nonmonitoring treatments, except for focal therapy, while an important growth of appeal has been recorded for AS. Understanding people inquisitiveness together with their degree of knowledge could be supportive to guiding counselling in the decision-making process and putting effort in certifying patient information.

However, no direct comparisons are available regarding the type of surgical approach (open vs. robotic) in the metastatic setting. To address intraoperative and postoperative complications of robotically assisted CRP relative to open CRP in patients with metastatic prostate cancer.  Patients and methods:   Within the National Inpatient Sample database (2008-2013), we identified patients with metastatic prostate cancer who underwent robotically assisted versus open CRP. Multivariable logistic regression, multivariable Poisson regression models, and linear regression models were used.  Results:   Of 874 patients who underwent CRP, 412 (47.1%) versus 462 (52.9%) underwent open versus robotically assisted CRP, respectively. Between 2008 and 2013, robotically assisted CRP rates increased from 7.6% to 50.0% (P = .5). In multivariable logistic regression models, robotically assisted CRP resulted in lower rates of overall (odds ratio [OR], 0.42; P < .001), miscellaneous medical (OR, 0.47; P = .02), and miscellaneous surgical complications (OR, 0.40; P = .04), as well as in lower rates of blood transfusions (OR, 0.19; P < .001). In multivariable Poisson regression models, robotically assisted CRP was associated with shorter stay (OR, 0.72; P < .001) and higher total hospital charges ($2483 more for each robotic surgery; P < .001). Similar results were recorded after adjustment for clustering.  Conclusion:   The intraoperative and postoperative complications associated with robotically assisted CRP are lower than those of open CRP. Similarly, robotically assisted CRP is associated with shorter stay. Conversely, an increase in total hospital charges is associated with robotically assisted CRP. Nonetheless, the complication profile of robotically assisted CRP validates its safety and feasibility.""","""['Felix Preisser', 'Sebastiano Nazzani', 'Elio Mazzone', 'Michele Marchioni', 'Marco Bandini', 'Zhe Tian', 'Alexander Haese', 'Fred Saad', 'Kevin Zorn', 'Francesco Montorsi', 'Shahrokh F Shariat', 'Markus Graefen', 'Derya Tilki', 'Pierre I Karakiewicz']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Clin Genitourin Cancer""","""['Comparison of Perioperative Outcomes Between Cytoreductive Radical Prostatectomy and Radical Prostatectomy for Nonmetastatic Prostate Cancer.', 'Regional differences in total hospital charges between open and robotically assisted radical prostatectomy in the United States.', 'da Vinci and Open Radical Prostatectomy: Comparison of Clinical Outcomes and Analysis of Insurance Costs.', 'Cytoreductive radical prostatectomy in metastatic prostate cancer: Does it really make sense?', 'Robotic vs. Retropubic radical prostatectomy in prostate cancer: A systematic review and an meta-analysis update.', 'Oligometastatic Prostate Cancer: Is there a Role for Surgery?

Material and methods:   All radiotherapy centres that declared providing brachytherapy were found from the French national institute of cancer registry and they were asked to reply to an online form in April 2018.  Results:   Fifty-two of the 54-brachytherapy centres (96%) replied the form and 34 centres did prostate brachytherapy. Among those centres, 32 performed iodine 125 low-dose rate brachytherapy as monotherapy, 19 provided brachytherapy boost (eight centres low-dose rate 125I; seven centres high-dose rate; four centres both). Among the centres not performing brachytherapy boost, 18 wanted to do, eight did not want and nine did not reply. The main reasons for reluctance towards brachytherapy boost were: organization constraints (three centres), refer patients to a nearby brachytherapy centre (one centre), technical issues (two centres) and lack of strong scientific evidences (two centres). In terms of human resources, the mean number of trained physicians and physicists were two (range: 1-6) and three (range: 1-5) respectively.

Objective:   To compare the effectiveness and tolerability of adjuvant radiotherapy following radical prostatectomy.  Design, setting, and participants:   This was a randomised, open-label, parallel-group trial. A total of 250 patients were enrolled between April 2004 and October 2012 in eight Finnish hospitals, with pT2 with positive margins or pT3a, pN0, M0 cancer without seminal vesicle invasion.  Intervention:   A total of 126 patients received adjuvant radiotherapy at 66.6Gy.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   The primary endpoint was biochemical recurrence-free survival, which we analysed using the Kaplan-Meier method and Cox proportional hazard regression. Overall survival, cancer-specific survival, local recurrence, and adverse events were secondary endpoints.  Results and limitations:   The median follow-up time for patients who were alive when the follow-up ended was 9.3yr in the adjuvant group and 8.6yr in the observation group. The 10-yr survival for biochemical recurrence was 82% in the adjuvant group and 61% in the observation group (hazard ratio [HR] 0.26 [95% confidence interval {CI} 0.14-0.48], p<0.001), and for overall survival 92% and 87%, respectively (HR 0.69 [95% CI 0.29-1.60], p=0.4). Two and four metastatic cancers occurred, respectively. Out of the 43 patients with biochemical recurrence in the observation group, 37 patients received salvage radiotherapy. In the adjuvant group, 56% experienced grade 3 adverse events, versus 40% in the observation group (p=0.016). Only one grade 4 adverse event occurred (adjuvant group). A limitation of this study was the number of patients.  Conclusions:   Adjuvant radiotherapy following radical prostatectomy is generally well tolerated and prolongs biochemical recurrence-free survival compared with radical prostatectomy alone in patients with positive margins or extracapsular extension.

However, few have reported outcomes for prostate SBRT using periprostatic hydrogel spacer (SpaceOAR; Augmenix). Herein, we report safety and efficacy outcomes from our institutional prostate SBRT experience with SpaceOAR placement.  Methods:   Fifty men with low- or intermediate-risk prostate cancer treated at a single institution with linear accelerator-based SBRT to 3625 cGy in 5 fractions, with or without androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) were included. All patients underwent SpaceOAR and fiducial marker placement followed by pre-treatment MRI. Toxicity assessments were conducted at least weekly while on treatment, 1 month after treatment, and every follow-up visit thereafter. Post-treatment PSA measurements were obtained 4 months after SBRT, followed by every 3-6 months thereafter. Acute toxicity was documented per RTOG criteria.  Results:   Median follow up time was 20 (range 4-44) months. Median PSA at time of diagnosis was 7.4 (2.7-19.5) ng/ml. Eighteen men received 6 months of ADT for unfavorable intermediate risk disease. No PSA failures were recorded. Median PSA was 0.9 ng/mL at 20 months; 0.08 and 1.32 ng/mL in men who did and did not receive ADT, respectively. Mean prostate-rectum separation achieved with SpaceOAR was 9.6 ± 4 mm at the prostate midgland. No grade ≥ 3 GU or GI toxicity was recorded. During treatment, 30% of men developed new grade 2 GU toxicity (urgency or dysuria). These symptoms were present in 30% of men at 1 month and in 12% of men at 1 year post-treatment.

However, identification of SNVs using deep sequencing data is a challenging computational problem as different sequencing artifacts limit the analytical sensitivity of SNV detection, especially at low variant allele frequencies (VAFs).  Methods:   To address the problem of relatively high noise levels in amplicon-based deep sequencing data (e.g. with the Ion AmpliSeq technology) in the context of SNV calling, we have developed a new bioinformatics tool called AmpliSolve. AmpliSolve uses a set of normal samples to model position-specific, strand-specific and nucleotide-specific background artifacts (noise), and deploys a Poisson model-based statistical framework for SNV detection.  Results:   Our tests on both synthetic and real data indicate that AmpliSolve achieves a good trade-off between precision and sensitivity, even at VAF below 5% and as low as 1%. We further validate AmpliSolve by applying it to the detection of SNVs in 96 circulating tumor DNA samples at three clinically relevant genomic positions and compare the results to digital droplet PCR experiments.  Conclusions:   AmpliSolve is a new tool for in-silico estimation of background noise and for detection of low frequency SNVs in targeted deep sequencing data. Although AmpliSolve has been specifically designed for and tested on amplicon-based libraries sequenced with the Ion Torrent platform it can, in principle, be applied to other sequencing platforms as well.

However, the immunotherapeutic efficacy of this method has been greatly hindered by tumor evasion and diminished activities of NK cells. In the present study, a selenium (Se)-bearing ruthenium (Ru) complex (RuSe) was designed that could synergistically potentiate NK cell-mediated killing against prostate cancer cells. As expected, pretreatment of cancer cells with subtoxic doses of RuSe effectively augmented the lysis potency of NK cells, with up to 2.46-fold enhancement than NK cells alone, against PC3 cells. More importantly, low concentrations of RuSe could augment the tumor destroying potency of NK cells derived from 10 clinical patients, with the enhancement range from 0.78- to 11.9-fold against PC3 cells and 0.67- to 3.8-fold against LNCAP cells. Mechanistic studies revealed that the sensitizing effect of RuSe primarily depended on TRAIL/TRAIL-R and Fas/FasL-mediated signaling. Furthermore, the increased expression level of these ligands highly relied on ROS overproduction-triggered DNA damage and the downstream ATM and ATR pathways. Furthermore, RuSe potently activated and synergized with NK cells to restrain tumor growth in vivo without causing toxic side effects on major organs. Taken together, the current study not only provides a strategy for application of metal complexes in chemo-immunotherapy but also sheds light on the potential roles and mechanisms of action on such Se-containing drugs as efficient immune-sensitizing agents for NK cell-based immunotherapy.""","""['Haoqiang Lai', 'Delong Zeng', 'Chang Liu', 'Qi Zhang', 'Xuan Wang', 'Tianfeng Chen']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Biomaterials""","""['Clinical-grade ex vivo-expanded human natural killer cells up-regulate activating receptors and death receptor ligands and have enhanced cytolytic activity against tumor cells.', 'The proteasome inhibitor bortezomib disrupts tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) expression and natural killer (NK) cell killing of TRAIL receptor-positive multiple myeloma cells.', 'Natural killer (NK) cell-mediated cytotoxicity: differential use of TRAIL and Fas ligand by immature and mature primary human NK cells.', 'Mechanisms of Apoptosis Resistance to NK Cell-Mediated Cytotoxicity in Cancer.', 'The multifaceted role of TRAIL signaling in cancer and immunity.', 'Selenium-ruthenium complex blocks H1N1 influenza virus-induced cell damage by activating GPx1/TrxR1.', 'Selenium speciation-dependent cancer radiosensitization by induction of G2/M cell cycle arrest and apoptosis.', 'Theranostic applications of selenium nanomedicines against lung cancer.', 'Protective effect of spore oil-functionalized nano-selenium system on cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity by regulating oxidative stress-mediated pathways and activating immune response.', 'Selenium-Containing Agents Acting on Cancer-A New Hope?']"""

Studies suggest that cancer stem cells (CSCs) are associated with stemness characteristics, providing some support for the concept that CSCs act as osteosclerotic precursors in bone microenvironmental niches. Here, we asked whether ectopic overexpression of CD133 maintains stability of CSCs in human PC cell lines and induces the changes of molecular features in the bone microenvironment. Ectopic overexpression of CD133 in PC3 or DU145 cells led to increased expression of ALDHA1, OCT4, and NANOG, enhanced colony-forming ability, and increased ALDH activity. In addition, micro-CT imaging, confocal microscopy, and H&E staining of mouse tissue confirmed that CD133 overexpression in PC3 and DU145 led to marked osteolytic bone tumor. However, expression of osteoblastic markers such as collagen type I, bone sialoprotein, and osteocalcin (OC) at the tumor margin of CD133-overexpressing PC3 tumors in mouse tibiae was higher than that of CD133-overexpressing DU145 tumors with osteosclerotic molecular features. In addition, expression of osteopontin (OPN) mRNA/protein by CD133-overexpressing PC3 cells was higher than that by DU145 cells. Especially, conditioned medium (CM) from PC3CD133+ cells increased osterix (OSX) activity in bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs), resulting in increased expression of OC mRNA/protein resulted in increased staining of mineralized matrix by Alizarin red. However, CM from OPN silenced PC3CD133+ cells led to a reduction of OC mRNA and protein expression through OSX activity resulted in reduced amount of mineralized matrix. In conclusion, these findings suggest that CD133 plays a functional role in regulating CSC characteristics in PCs and modulates their abilities in which induce the osteosclerosis of BMSCs. In addition, OPN from CSCs acts as a niche component that promotes osteosclerosis by supporting osteoblastic differentiation of BMSCs.""","""['Donghwi Kim', 'Youngjong Ko', 'Mineon Park', 'Bora Kim', 'HongMoon Sohn', 'Wonbong Lim']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""JBMR Plus""","""['Effect of CD133 overexpression on bone metastasis in prostate cancer cell line LNCaP.', 'Regulation of prostate cancer cell migration toward bone marrow stromal cell-conditioned medium by Wnt5a signaling.', ""Secreted factors from metastatic prostate cancer cells stimulate mesenchymal stem cell transition to a pro-tumourigenic 'activated' state that enhances prostate cancer cell migration."", 'The Pinx1 Gene Downregulates Telomerase and Inhibits Proliferation of CD133+ Cancer Stem Cells Isolated from a Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma Cell Line by Regulating Trfs and Mad1/C-Myc/p53 Pathways.', 'Thyroid Cancer Stem-Like Cells: From Microenvironmental Niches to Therapeutic Strategies.', 'State-of-the-art therapeutic strategies for targeting cancer stem cells in prostate cancer.', 'Signaling Pathways and Targeted Therapies for Stem Cells in Prostate Cancer.', 'Recent Advances of Osterix Transcription Factor in Osteoblast Differentiation and Bone Formation.']"""

However, the acquisition of chemoresistance has become a major cause of chemotherapy failure. The long noncoding RNA DANCR is demonstrated to serve as an oncogene in various human cancers, including PC. However, the potential role of DANCR in docetaxel (DTX) resistance of PC and its underlying mechanism remains unclear. Methods: The abundance of DANCR, miR-34a-5p, and JAG1 mRNA was examined by quantitative reverse transcription PCR. The Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK8) was used to determine the 50% inhibitory concentration value. Cell viability was evaluated by CCK8 and colony-formation assays. Transwells were utilized to analyze cell migration and invasion ability. The protein levels of LRP, P-gp, MRP1, and JAG1 were measured by Western blot assay. The target relationship between DANCR and miR-34a-5p, as well as miR-34a-5p and JAG1, was demonstrated by dual-luciferase, RNA immunoprecipitation, and RNA pull-down analysis. Tumor xenograft was undertaken to confirm the effect of DANCR on DTX resistance in PC. Results: DANCR and JAG1 were significantly upregulated, but miR-34a-5p was downregulated in DTX-resistant PC. Silencing of DANCR improved the DTX efficacy in DTX-resistant PC cells. DANCR served as a competing endogenous RNA of miR-34a-5p, leading to the derepression of miR-34a-5p target JAG1, which eventually triggered the resistance to DTX in DTX-tolerated PC. Conclusion: The DANCR/miR-34a-5p axis enhanced DTX resistance of PC via targeting JAG1, providing a novel insight to improve chemotherapy for PC.""","""['Yongliang Ma', 'Bo Fan', 'Zongtao Ren', 'Bin Liu', 'Yanchao Wang']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Onco Targets Ther""","""['MicroRNA-34a Attenuates Paclitaxel Resistance in Prostate Cancer Cells via Direct Suppression of JAG1/Notch1 Axis.', 'Long noncoding RNA MALAT1 enhances the docetaxel resistance of prostate cancer cells via miR-145-5p-mediated regulation of AKAP12.', 'miR-214-5p targeted by LncRNA DANCR mediates TGF-β signaling pathway to accelerate proliferation, migration and inhibit apoptosis of prostate cancer cells.', 'lncRNA-DANCR Promotes Taxol Resistance of Prostate Cancer Cells through Modulating the miR-33b-5p-LDHA Axis.', 'A review on the role of DANCR in the carcinogenesis.', 'JAG1 enhances angiogenesis in triple-negative breast cancer through promoting the secretion of exosomal lncRNA MALAT1.', 'FOXA1-induced LINC00621 promotes lung adenocarcinoma progression via activating the TGF-β signaling pathway.', 'Notch-associated lncRNAs profiling circuiting epigenetic modification in colorectal cancer.', 'ABCC6P1 pseudogene induces ABCC6 upregulation and multidrug resistance in breast cancer.', 'The emerging potentials of lncRNA DRAIC in human cancers.']"""

The mechanistic basis of neuroendocrine differentiation is poorly understood, contributing to lack of effective predictive biomarkers and late disease recognition. The purpose of this study was to examine the role of novel proneural Pit-Oct-Unc-domain transcription factors (TF) in NEPC and examine their potential as noninvasive predictive biomarkers.Experimental Design: Prostate cancer patient-derived xenograft models, clinical samples, and cellular neuroendocrine differentiation models were employed to determine the expression of TFs BRN1 and BRN4. BRN4 levels were modulated in prostate cancer cell lines followed by functional assays. Furthermore, extracellular vesicles (EV) were isolated from patient samples and cell culture models, characterized by nanoparticle tracking analyses, Western blotting, and real-time PCR.  Results:   We identify for the first time that: (i) BRN4 is amplified and overexpressed in NEPC clinical samples and that BRN4 overexpression drives neuroendocrine differentiation via its interplay with BRN2, a TF that was previously implicated in NEPC; (ii) BRN4 and BRN2 mRNA are actively released in prostate cancer EVs upon neuroendocrine differentiation induction; and (iii) enzalutamide treatment augments release of BRN4 and BRN2 in prostate cancer EVs, promoting neuroendocrine differentiation induction.  Conclusions:   Our study identifies a novel TF that drives NEPC and suggests that as adaptive mechanism to enzalutamide treatment, prostate cancer cells express and secrete BRN4 and BRN2 in EVs that drive oncogenic reprogramming of prostate cancer cells to NEPC.

Currently it is unknown whether Ads contributes to the subcortical actin remodeling associated with the formation of cell extensions and matrix invasion in cancer. We compared cell extension formation and matrix degradation in Ads wildtype and Ads-null MCF7 breast cancer cells generated by CRISPR/Cas9. Compared with wildtype, Ads-null cells plated on fibronectin or collagen exhibited a more circular morphology with shorter cell extensions (37% reduction on fibronectin; p < 0.001). Reconstitution of Ads in Ads-null cells restored the formation of cell extensions (p < 0.05). While cell migration on two-dimensional matrices was unchanged by Ads deletion, the formation of cell extensions across Transwell membranes was reduced (~40% reduction, p < 0.05). When plated on fibrillar collagen, compared with wildtype, Ads-null cells showed reduced expression of MT1-MMP, collagen degradation (p < 0.05) and phagocytosis of collagen-coated beads (25% reduction; p = 0.001).

Purpose:   To determine the interobserver agreement of PI-RADS v2 lexicon among eight radiologists with varying levels of experience.  Study type:   Retrospective.  Population:   In all, 160 consecutively imaged men with confirmatory targeted biopsy.  Field strength/sequence:   3T scanner without an endorectal coil. T2 -weighted imaging (T2 w), diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) map and dynamic contrast-enhanced sequence were performed.  Assessment:   Eight radiologists (two highly experienced, two moderately experienced, and four less experienced) independently read 130 lesions in the peripheral zone (PZ) and 30 lesions in the transition zone (TZ), blinded to clinical MRI indication and biopsy results. The features described in PI-RADS v2 for TZ and PZ lesions were evaluated.  Statistical tests:   Conger's kappa, percentage of concordance, and first-order agreement coefficient (AC1) were used to evaluate interobserver agreement.  Results:   From the features evaluated on PZ lesions, definite extraprostatic extension (EPE) / invasive behavior on T2 w had good agreement (AC1 = 0.80), and the others had fair agreement (AC1 = 0.32-0.40). From the features evaluated on TZ lesions, two had good agreement: definite EPE/invasive behavior (AC1 = 0.77) and moderate/marked hypointensity (AC1 = 0.67) on T2 w. Encapsulation and lenticular shape on T2 w, focal (not indistinct) on DWI and ADC map, and marked hypointensity on ADC map (AC1 = 0.45 to 0.60) had moderate agreement, whereas heterogeneous and circumscribed (not obscured margins) on T2 w, marked hyperintensity on high-b-value DWI, and the presence or not of early enhancement in the lesion/region of the lesion (AC1 = 0.30 to 0.38) had fair agreement.

Methods:   We reviewed data from patients with mCRPC who had been treated with cabazitaxel therapy at four institutions belonging to Tokai Urologic Oncology Research Seminar. Patients eligible for this study had received at least three cycles of cabazitaxel treatment at three- or four-week intervals. The PSA response patterns were categorized as primary resistance (PR), response (RE), stabilization (ST), and fluctuating (FL). The overall survival (OS) was compared among the patterns.  Results:   Data from a total of 50 patients were analyzed in this study. The number of patients exhibiting PR, RE, ST and FL patterns were 18 (36%), 14 (28%), 12 (24%) and 6 (12%), respectively. The median (95% CI) OS of patients with PR and RE patterns was 10.7 (5.6-15.9) and 14.9 (6.8-23.0) months, respectively, and was not reached for patients with ST and FL patterns. The OS of patients with the FL pattern was significantly better than that of patients with PR (P = 0.012) and RE (P = 0.010) patterns.  Conclusion:   There were some patients whose PSA were fluctuating during cabazitaxel therapy in patients with mCRPC.

Following 48 hr genistein treatment, cell-based assays and genome-wide microarray were performed. It was evidenced that maximal physiologically achievable concentrations of genistein (0.5-10 μM) lead to significant increase in cell viability (p < 0.05) and decrease in migration at 0.5 μM (p = 0.000) and 10 μM (p = 0.001). The highest percentage of apoptotic cells was obtained at 50 μM. Microarray analysis gave the most critical pathways such as cell cycle regulation and proliferation, tumorigenesis, DNA damage and repair, stress response, and apoptosis. Physiological concentrations (≤10 μM) induced activation of CDKs, MAPKs, and RPSKs, while high concentrations of genistein (>10 μM) appeared to have a novel mechanism of action, specifically down-regulating TGF-β by decreasing specifically SMAD 2/3,4 which are in the downstream TGF-β signaling cascade. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: This study highlights for the first time that maximal physiologically achievable concentrations of genistein (0.5-10 μM) have proliferative effects evidenced by alterations in global gene expression patterns of PC-3 cells. Our results particularly represent a closer examination of dietary genistein consumption for the prevention and/or treatment of cancer that maximal physiologically achievable concentrations of genistein could have detrimental effects on individuals with prostate cancer.

DU-145 human prostate cancer cells provide an opportunity to investigate prostate cancer. Betaine has a number of anticancer effects, such as inactivation of carcinogens, inhibition of cancer cell proliferation, angiogenesis, and metastasis. However, there is no study investigating the effects of betaine on DU-145 cells. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of different concentrations of betaine on the oxidative stress, apoptosis, and inflammation on DU-145 cells. Firstly, we proved the cytotoxic activity of betaine (0 to 150 mg/ml) on DU-145 cells by using 3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol, 2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) and defined the optimal concentration of betaine. Then, by employing the doses found in MTT, the levels of antioxidant (GSH, SOD, CAT, and TAS) and oxidant (MDA and TOS) molecules, pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-a and IL-6), apoptotic proteins (CYCS and CASP3), and DNA fragmentation were measured. Morphological changes and apoptosis were evaluated using H&E technique, Bax and Bcl-2 immunohistochemistry. Results suggested that betaine caused oxidative stress, inflammation, inhibition of cell growth, apoptosis, and morphological alterations in DU-145 cells dose-dependently. Furthermore, treatments with increasing betaine concentrations decreased the antioxidant levels in cells. We actually revealed that betaine, known as an antioxidant, may prevent cell proliferation by acting as an oxidant in certain doses. In conclusion, betaine may act as a biological response modifier in prostate cancer treatment in a dose-dependent manner.""","""['Fatih Kar', 'Ceyhan Hacioglu', 'Sedat Kacar', 'Varol Sahinturk', 'Gungor Kanbak']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Cell Stress Chaperones""","""['High Concentrations of Boric Acid Trigger Concentration-Dependent Oxidative Stress, Apoptotic Pathways and Morphological Alterations in DU-145 Human Prostate Cancer Cell Line.', 'Concentration-Dependent Effects of Zinc Sulfate on DU-145 Human Prostate Cancer Cell Line: Oxidative, Apoptotic, Inflammatory, and Morphological Analyzes.', 'Isoflavone lupiwighteone induces cytotoxic, apoptotic, and antiangiogenic activities in DU-145 prostate cancer cells.', 'Involvement of Bax and Bcl-2 in Induction of Apoptosis by Essential Oils of Three Lebanese Salvia Species in Human Prostate Cancer Cells.', 'Ouabain induces apoptotic cell death in human prostate DU 145 cancer cells through DNA damage and TRAIL pathways.', 'Live Biotherapeutic Lactococcus lactis GEN3013 Enhances Antitumor Efficacy of Cancer Treatment via Modulation of Cancer Progression and Immune System.', 'Intracellular Pathways and Mechanisms of Colored Secondary Metabolites in Cancer Therapy.', 'Cytotoxic and Apoptotic Effects of the Combination of Borax (Sodium Tetraborate) and 5-Fluorouracil on DLD-1 Human Colorectal Adenocarcinoma Cell Line.', 'Blocking glycine utilization inhibits multiple myeloma progression by disrupting glutathione balance.', 'Serum Metabolomics Coupling With Clinical Laboratory Indicators Reveal Taxonomic Features of Leukemia.']"""

Methods:   This report describes the PK of seviteronel (50-750 mg, QD or BID) using noncompartmental and population approaches from 243 patients with advanced breast or prostate cancer pooled across 4 clinical studies. First dose and steady-state PK were examined, as well as covariates including prandial status, sex and concomitant dexamethasone.  Results:   Seviteronel PK can be characterized by transit absorption and a bi-phasic first-order elimination while accounting for covariance between random effects. Prandial status did not significantly affect any parameters to a clinically-relevant extent. Both sex and body weight were significant covariates on clearance, explaining 37% of the interindividual variability on that parameter. There were no significant effects from the race or the presence of a corticosteroid (either dexamethasone or prednisone).  Conclusions:   Seviteronel demonstrates linear PK over the dose range of 50-750 mg given either BID or QD in men with advanced CRPC or men and women with breast cancer. The disposition of seviteronel following oral administration is well described by this population PK model and can be used for accurate simulations for future studies with body weight and sex affecting clearance, but not to a clinically-meaningful degree requiring a change in the current dosing scheme.""","""['Cody J Peer', 'Keith T Schmidt', 'Jessica D Kindrick', 'Joel R Eisner', 'Victoria V Brown', 'Edwina Baskin-Bey', 'Ravi Madan', 'William D Figg']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Cancer Chemother Pharmacol""","""['Phase 2 Study of Seviteronel (INO-464) in Patients With Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer After Enzalutamide Treatment.', 'Phase 1 study of seviteronel, a selective CYP17 lyase and androgen receptor inhibitor, in women with estrogen receptor-positive or triple-negative breast cancer.', 'Phase I Study of Seviteronel, a Selective CYP17 Lyase and Androgen Receptor Inhibitor, in Men with Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'The hunt for a selective 17,20 lyase inhibitor; learning lessons from nature.', 'Phase I and II therapies targeting the androgen receptor for the treatment of castration resistant prostate cancer.', 'Recent Discoveries in the Androgen Receptor Pathway in Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Phase 2 Study of Seviteronel (INO-464) in Patients With Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer After Enzalutamide Treatment.']"""

Here, we demonstrate that AR uses the translation machinery to shape the cellular proteome. We show that AR is a negative regulator of protein synthesis and identify an unexpected relationship between AR and the process of translation initiation in vivo. This is mediated through direct transcriptional control of the translation inhibitor 4EBP1. We demonstrate that lowering AR abundance increases the assembly of the eIF4F translation initiation complex, which drives enhanced tumor cell proliferation. Furthermore, we uncover a network of pro-proliferation mRNAs characterized by a guanine-rich cis-regulatory element that is particularly sensitive to eIF4F hyperactivity. Using both genetic and pharmacologic methods, we demonstrate that dissociation of the eIF4F complex reverses the proliferation program, resulting in decreased tumor growth and improved survival in preclinical models.

IL-30 knockdown in PC-SLCs reduced cancer cell proliferation, vascularization and intra-tumoral Indoleamine 2,3-Dioxygenase (IDO)+CD11b+Gr-1+ myeloid-derived cells (MDCs) and led to a significant delay in tumor growth and increase in survival. IL-30-silenced tumors developed in IL-30KO mice, IL-30-/-tumors, lacked vascular supply and displayed frequent apoptotic cancer cells entrapped by perforin+TRAIL+CD3+Tlymphocytes, most of which had a CD4+T phenotype, whereas IL-10+TGFβ+Foxp3+Tregs were lacking. IL-30 silencing in PC-SLCs prevented lung metastasis in 73% of tumor-bearing WT mice and up to 80% in tumor-bearing IL-30KO mice. In patients with high-grade and locally advanced PC, those with IL-30-/-tumors, showed distinct intra-tumoral cytotoxic granule-associated RNA binding protein (TIA-1)+CD4+Tlymphocyte infiltrate, rare Foxp3+Tregs and a lower biochemical recurrence rate compared to patients with IL-30+/+tumors in which IL-30 is expressed in both tumor cells and infiltrating leukocytes.  Conclusion:   The lack of host leukocyte-derived IL-30 inhibits Tregs expansion, promotes intra-tumoral infiltration of CD4+T lymphocytes and cancer cell apoptosis. Concomitant lack of MDC influx, obtained by IL-30 silencing in PC-SLCs, boosts cytotoxic T lymphocyte activation and cancer cell apoptosis resulting in a synergistic tumor suppression with the prospective benefit of better survival for patients with advanced disease.""","""['Carlo Sorrentino', 'Zhinan Yin', 'Stefania Ciummo', 'Paola Lanuti', 'Li-Fan Lu', 'Marco Marchisio', 'Matteo Bellone', 'Emma Di Carlo']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""J Immunother Cancer""","""['CD4/CD8\xa0+\xa0T cells, DC subsets, Foxp3, and IDO expression are predictive indictors of gastric cancer prognosis.', 'Blockade of interleukin-27 signaling reduces GVHD in mice by augmenting Treg reconstitution and stabilizing Foxp3 expression.', 'Tumor-infiltrating regulatory T cells, CD8/Treg ratio, and cancer stem cells are correlated with lymph node metastasis in patients with early breast cancer.', 'Therapeutic gene modified cell based cancer vaccines.', 'The role of regulatory T cells in the pathogenesis and treatment of prostate cancer.', 'Inactivation of interleukin-30 in colon cancer stem cells via CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing inhibits their oncogenicity and improves host survival.', 'Identification of the Key Genes Involved in the Tumorigenesis and Prognosis of Prostate Cancer.', 'CRISPR/Cas9-mediated deletion of Interleukin-30 suppresses IGF1 and CXCL5 and boosts SOCS3 reducing prostate cancer growth and mortality.', 'Understanding and targeting prostate cancer cell heterogeneity and plasticity.', 'Interleukin-30 feeds breast cancer stem cells via CXCL10 and IL23 autocrine loops and shapes immune contexture and host outcome.']"""

Denosumab demonstrated superiority over zoledronic acid in delaying the time to first SRE. This study examined the lifetime cost-effectiveness of denosumab vs zoledronic acid from both US payer and societal perspectives.Methods: This analysis used a lifetime Markov model and included patients with breast cancer, prostate cancer, and other solid tumors and bone metastases. The societal perspective included direct medical, direct non-medical, and indirect costs associated with denosumab and zoledronic acid; the payer perspective included direct medical costs only. Bone complication rates for each tumor type were estimated from three pivotal phase 3 studies and modified to reflect real-world incidence.Results: From a societal perspective, compared with zoledronic acid, denosumab use resulted in an incremental cost of $9,043, an incremental benefit of 0.128 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), a lifetime cost per QALY of $70,730, and a net monetary benefit (NMB) of $10,135 in favor of denosumab. Direct drug costs for denosumab ($28,352) were higher than zoledronic acid/untreated ($578), but were offset by reduced costs associated with bone complications. From a payer perspective, denosumab use was associated with an incremental cost of $13,396, and an incremental benefit of 0.128 QALYs, for a cost of $104,778 per QALY and an NMB of $5,782 in favor of denosumab.Limitations: Some model inputs had limited information and, given that the results may be sensitive to changes in these inputs, our findings should be interpreted within the context of the data inputs and modeling assumptions used in the analysis.Conclusions: Denosumab is a cost-effective option to prevent bone complications in patients with solid tumors when considering both payer and broader societal perspectives.""","""['Alison Stopeck', 'Adam Brufsky', 'Lisa Kennedy', 'Sumi Bhatta', 'Debajyoti Bhowmik', 'Jacqueline Buchanan', 'Nicolas Despiegel', 'Guy Hechmati']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""J Med Econ""","""['Economic evaluation of denosumab compared with zoledronic acid in hormone-refractory prostate cancer patients with bone metastases.', 'A cost-effectiveness analysis of denosumab for the prevention of skeletal-related events in patients with multiple myeloma in the United States of America.', 'Cost-effectiveness of denosumab vs zoledronic acid for prevention of skeletal-related events in patients with solid tumors and bone metastases in the United States.', 'Systematic review of the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness, and economic evaluation, of denosumab for the treatment of bone metastases from solid tumours.', 'Zoledronic acid: a pharmacoeconomic review of its use in the management of bone metastases.', 'Cost-effectiveness analysis of five drugs for treating postmenopausal women in the United States with osteoporosis and a very high fracture risk.', 'Healthcare resource utilization and associated cost of patients with bone metastases from solid tumors who are naïve to bone-targeting agents: a comparative analysis of patients with and without skeletal-related events.', 'Metastasis-directed therapy for oligometastasis and beyond.']"""

Materials and methods:   Three advanced radiation therapy treatment planning tools, including auto-planning, knowledge-based planning, and multiple criteria optimization, were assessed on 20 previously treated clinical cases. Three institutions participated in this study, each with expertise in one of these tools. The twenty cases were retrospectively selected from Cleveland Clinic, including five head-and-neck (HN) cases, five brain cases, five prostate with pelvic lymph nodes cases, and five spine cases. A set of general planning objectives and organs-at-risk (OAR) dose constraints for each disease site from Cleveland Clinic was shared with other two institutions. A total of 60 IMRT research plans (20 from each institution) were designed with the same beam configuration as in the respective manual plans. For each disease site, detailed isodoseline distributions and dose volume histograms for a randomly selected representative case were compared among the three research plans and manual plan. In addition, dosimetric endpoints of five cases for each site were compared.  Results:   Compared to the manual plans, the research plans using advanced tools showed substantial improvement for the HN patient cases, including the maximum dose to the spinal cord and brainstem and mean dose to the parotid glands. For the brain, prostate, and spine cases, the four types of plans were comparable based on dosimetric endpoint comparisons.  Conclusion:   With minimal planner interventions, advanced treatment planning tools are clinically useful, producing a plan quality similarly to or better than manual plans, improving plan consistency. For difficult cases such as HN cancer, advanced planning tools can further reduce radiation doses to numerous OARs while delivering adequate dose to the tumor targets.""","""['Lan Lu', 'Yang Sheng', 'Jeremy Donaghue', 'Zhilei Liu Shen', 'Matt Kolar', 'Q Jackie Wu', 'Ping Xia']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""J Appl Clin Med Phys""","""['Modeling the dosimetry of organ-at-risk in head and neck IMRT planning: an intertechnique and interinstitutional study.', 'Dependence of achievable plan quality on treatment technique and planning goal refinement: a head-and-neck intensity modulated radiation therapy application.', 'Evaluation of auto-planning in IMRT and VMAT for head and neck cancer.', 'Revisiting the dose constraints for head and neck OARs in the current era of IMRT.', 'Rapid advances in auto-segmentation of organs at risk and target volumes in head and neck cancer.', 'Using feasibility dose-volume histograms to reduce intercampus plan quality variability for head-and-neck cancer.', 'Evaluation of Automated Treatment Planning and Organ Dose Prediction for Lung Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy.', 'Quantitative Comparison of Knowledge-Based and Manual Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy Planning for Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma.', 'Dose-volume histogram analysis and clinical evaluation of knowledge-based plans with manual objective constraints for pharyngeal cancer.', 'Incorporating Case-Based Reasoning for Radiation Therapy Knowledge Modeling: A Pelvic Case Study.']"""

Accumulating evidence has demonstrated that hypoxia/hypoxia‑inducing factor (HIF) is involved in the induction of epithelial‑mesenchymal transition (EMT) and increased metastatic potential in PCa. However, the mechanism by which hypoxia/HIF regulates EMT remains unclear. In the present study, we demonstrated the molecular mechanisms of hypoxia‑induced EMT in PCa, focusing on HIF‑1α/Forkhead box M1 (FoxM1) signaling pathway. PCa PC3 and DU145 cell lines were used as the model system in vitro. Our data revealed that hypoxia induced EMT in PCa cells. Bioinformatics analysis identified the possible association between HIF‑1α and FoxM1. Additionally, FoxM1 was significantly associated with PCa development and Gleason scores of PCa. Exposure to hypoxia resulted in the increased expression of HIF‑1α and FoxM1. Genetic knockdown FoxM1 abolished hypoxia‑induced EMT in PCa, while exogenous overexpression of FoxM1 facilitated hypoxia‑induced EMT. Furthermore, the increase of FoxM1 during hypoxia was due to the transcriptional regulation on the FoxM1 promoter by HIF‑1α. We also confirmed the binding site of HIF‑1α on the FoxM1 promoter by different lengths promoter sequences. These findings provide new insights into how EMT is regulated in PCa under hypoxic stress. It is worthwhile to investigate in future that inhibition of FoxM1 as a potential target may be an effective therapeutic strategy against PCa.""","""['Cong Tang', 'Tianjie Liu', 'Ke Wang', 'Xinyang Wang', 'Shan Xu', 'Dalin He', 'Jin Zeng']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Oncol Rep""","""['FOXM1 promotes the progression of prostate cancer by regulating PSA gene transcription.', 'The TNF-α/ROS/HIF-1-induced upregulation of FoxMI expression promotes HCC proliferation and resistance to apoptosis.', 'Increased FoxM1 expression is a target for metformin in the suppression of EMT in prostate cancer.', 'Role of FoxM1 in the Progression and Epithelial to Mesenchymal Transition of Gastrointestinal Cancer.', 'Regulation of the master regulator FOXM1 in cancer.', 'MiR-210 regulates lung adenocarcinoma by targeting HIF-1α.', 'FOXM1: A small fox that makes more tracks for cancer progression and metastasis.', 'Genetic Predisposition to Hepatocellular Carcinoma.', 'Investigating the effects of chronic low-dose radiation exposure in the liver of a hypothermic zebrafish model.', 'Targeting Mitochondrial ROS Production to Reverse the Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition in Breast Cancer Cells.']"""

Although there are numerous therapeutic strategies, a more effective modality with least side effects is urgently required for the treatment of prostate cancer. Carvacrol is a monoterpenoid phenol and majorly present in the essential oils of Lamiaceae family plants. Many previous reports have shown various biological activities of carvacrol like antioxidant, antiinflammatory and anticancer properties. Recently, we have shown potent anticancer property of carvacrol against prostate cancer cell line DU145. In the current study, we report the chemopreventive and therapeutic potential of carvacrol against another prostate cancer cell line PC-3 with its detailed mechanism of action.  Methods:   To determine the effect of the carvacrol on prostate cancer cells, the cell viability was estimated by MTT assay and cell death was estimated by LDH release assay. The apoptotic assay was performed by DAPI staining and FITC-Annexin V assay. Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) was estimated by DCFDA method. Cell cycle analysis was performed by flow cytometry. Gene expression analysis was performed by quantitative real time PCR.  Results:   Our results suggested that the carvacrol treatment significantly reduced the cell viability of PC-3 cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. The antiproliferative action of carvacrol was correlated with apoptosis which was confirmed by nuclear condensation, FITC-Annexin V assay, modulation in expression of Bax, Bcl-2 and caspase activation. The mechanistic insight into carvacrol-induced apoptosis leads to finding of elevated level of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) and mitochondrial membrane potential disruption. Cell cycle analysis revealed that carvacrol prevented cell cycle in G0/G1 that was associated with decline in expression of cyclin D1 and Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 4 (CDK4) and augmented expression of CDK inhibitor p21. Having been said the role of hyperactivation of Notch signaling in prostate cancer, we also deciphered that carvacrol could inhibit Notch signaling in PC-3 cells via downregulation of Notch-1, and Jagged-1.  Conclusion:   Thus, our previous and current findings have established the strong potential of carvacrol as a chemopreventive agent against androgen-independent human prostate cancer cells.""","""['Fahad Khan', 'Vipendra K Singh', 'Mohd Saeed', 'Mohd A Kausar', 'Irfan A Ansari']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Anticancer Agents Med Chem""","""['Carvacrol Induces Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS)-mediated Apoptosis Along with Cell Cycle Arrest at G0/G1 in Human Prostate Cancer Cells.', 'Carvacrol Exhibits Chemopreventive Potential against Cervical Cancer Cells via Caspase-Dependent Apoptosis and Abrogation of Cell Cycle Progression.', 'SRJ23, a new semisynthetic andrographolide derivative: in vitro growth inhibition and mechanisms of cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in prostate cancer cells.', 'Molecular insights on chemopreventive and anticancer potential of carvacrol: Implications from solid carcinomas.', 'Carvacrol as a Prospective Regulator of Cancer Targets/Signalling Pathways.', 'Cucurbitacin-B instigates intrinsic apoptosis and modulates Notch signaling in androgen-dependent prostate cancer LNCaP cells.', 'Targeting signaling pathways in osteosarcoma: Mechanisms and clinical studies.', 'Thymus vulgaris Essential Oil in Beta-Cyclodextrin for Solid-State Pharmaceutical Applications.', 'IL-17/Notch1/STAT3 Pathway Contributes to 5-Fluorouracil-Induced Intestinal Mucositis in Rats: Amelioration by Thymol Treatment.', 'Therapeutic application of carvacrol: A comprehensive review.']"""

Methods:   We present data obtained from 1,002 cancer survivors (53% male, mean age=68 years, 26% prostate cancer, 22% breast cancer) across all cancer types 5 (N=660) and 10 (N=342) years after diagnosis, who were recruited via a large Clinical Cancer Registry in Germany in a cross-sectional study. FoR, depression, and anxiety were measured using validated self-report questionnaires (12-item short version of the Fear of Progression Questionnaire [FoP-Q-SF], Patient Health Questionnaire-9 [PHQ-9[, and General Anxiety Disorder-7 [GAD-7]). Hierarchical regression models were carried out with FoR as dependent variable and time since diagnosis as control variable.  Results:   We found high FoR-values in 17% of the cancer survivors (FoP-Q-SF total score>33). FoR was higher in the 5-year cohort (P=.028, d=0.153). Cancer survivors were most worried about the future of the family; they report being nervous prior to doctor's appointment and being afraid of relying on strangers help. Higher FoR was related to female gender (Beta=.149, P<.001), younger age (Beta=-.103, P<.001), low social (Beta=-.129, P<.001) and emotional functioning (Beta=-.269, P<.001), received hormone therapy (P=.025, d=0.056), and high anxiety levels (Beta=.227, P<.001).  Conclusions:   Even though FoR declines slightly over time, it is still a common mental health problem for long-term survivors even 10 years after cancer diagnosis. Since FoR is associated with reduced emotional and social quality of life, patients who are at greater risk of experiencing FoR must be identified and supported. Particularly at risk are younger women who received hormone therapy.""","""['Heide Götze', 'Sabine Taubenheim', 'Andreas Dietz', 'Florian Lordick', 'Anja Mehnert-Theuerkauf']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Psychooncology""","""['Fear of recurrence in long-term breast cancer survivors-still an issue.

In this approach, metals chelated to 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7,10-tetraacetic acid (DOTA) were placed on the side chains of lysine early in the synthesis to form imaging modules. These are coupled to targeting modules, in this case consisting of the PSMA-binding urea DCL, bonded to an activated linker. The modular approach to targeted molecular imaging agents (TMIAs) offers distinct advantages. By chelating the MRI contrast metal Gd early, it doubles as a protecting group for DOTA. Standard coupling and deprotection steps may be utilized to assemble the modules into peptides, and the need for tri-tert-butyl protection of DOTA requiring removal by strong acid is averted. This enables mild conjugation of the imaging module to a wide variety of targeting agents in the final step. It was further discovered that two labile metals, La3+ or Ce3+ , can be used as placeholders in DOTA during the synthesis, then transmetalated in mild acid by Cu2+ , Ga3+ , In3+ , and Y3+ , metals used in PET/SPECT. This enables the efficient synthesis of nonradioactive analogues of targeted molecular imaging agents that may be transported or stored until needed. A simple and mild two-step transmetalation, involving de-metalation in dilute acid, followed by rapid chelation of the radioactive metal, may be conveniently performed later at the clinic to provide the TMIAs for PET or SPECT.""","""['Hans F Schmitthenner', 'Damien E Dobson', 'Kelsea G Jones', 'Nnamdi Akporji', 'Dana Q M Soika', 'Kent L Nastiuk', 'Joseph P Hornak']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Chemistry""","""['Modular Synthesis of Peptide-Based Single- and Multimodal Targeted Molecular Imaging Agents.', 'Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen PET Imaging in Prostate Cancer: Opportunities and Challenges.', 'Development of a Ga-68 labeled PET tracer with short linker for prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) targeting.', 'Preclinical Evaluation of a Tailor-Made DOTA-Conjugated PSMA Inhibitor with Optimized Linker Moiety for Imaging and Endoradiotherapy of Prostate Cancer.', 'The ubiquitous DOTA and its derivatives: the impact of 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7,10-tetraacetic acid on biomedical imaging.', 'Modular Synthesis of Peptide-Based Single- and Multimodal Targeted Molecular Imaging Agents.']"""

However, the role and function of LINC00460 in prostate cancer is not identified. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the expression and effect of LINC00460 on prostate cancer cell malignant behaviors.  Patients and methods:   The expression of LINC00460 in cancer tissues and cell lines were detected by quantitative Real Time-Polymerase Chain Reaction (qRT-PCR) assay. The LINC00460 expression was downregulated by siRNA. The cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) assay was used to detect cell proliferation. The cell migration and invasion were detected by migration and Matrigel invasion assays. The Western blot assay was used to detect the altered expression levels of Ki67, Cyclin D1, PI3K, p-AKT, T-AKT, Bcl2, and Bax.  Results:   LINC00460 was increased in human prostate cancer tissues and cell lines. LINC00460 high expression was related to Tumor Size (T1-T2/T3-T4; p=0.004), and high Gleason Score (≤8/>8, p=0.000). Downregulation of LINC00460 by siRNA could inhibit cancer cell proliferation and decreased Ki67 and Cyclin D1 expression.

Material & methods:   Rectal swab samples collected from 99 patients suspected of prostate cancer two days before prostate biopsy were tested for microbial susceptibility and ESBL production. All patients were given standard ciprofloxacin and ornidazole prophylaxis. Ten days post-biopsy, the patients were contacted by phone and asked about the presence of fever and/or symptoms of urinary tract infection.  Results:   Escherichia coli (E.coli) was the most common isolate detected in 82 (75%) of the rectal swab samples. Ciprofloxacin resistance was detected in 33% and ESBL positivity in 22% of the isolated E.coli strains. No microorganisms other than E.coli were detected in blood, urine, and rectal swab cultures of patients who developed post-biopsy complications. CR E.coli strains also showed resistance to other antimicrobial agents. The lowest resistance rates were to amikacin (n = 2, 7.4%) and nitrofurantoin (n = 1, 3.7%). Seven patients (7.6%) developed infectious complications. There was no significant difference in probability of hospitalization between patients with CR strains (14.3%) and those with ciprofloxacin-susceptible strains (14.3% vs. 4.7%; p = 0.194). However, strains that were both CR and ESBL-positive were associated with significantly higher probability of hospitalization compared to ciprofloxacin-susceptible strains (28.6% vs. 3.8%; p = 0.009).  Conclusion:   The higher rate of infectious complications with CR and ESBL-positive strains suggests that the agents used for antibiotic prophylaxis should be reevaluated.

Early identification of recurrent disease after radiotherapy is important in considering suitability for early salvage therapy to improve prognosis. The aim is to identify patterns of suspected prostate cancer recurrence in relation to post-radiotherapy PSA levels, especially below the accepted Phoenix definition of PSA failure (PSA nadir + 2).  Methods:   This was a retrospective single tertiary institution cohort study of consecutive men between July 2014 and June 2018 who received a 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT for elevated PSA levels following radiotherapy as primary treatment of prostate cancer. The primary outcome measure was to determine the relationship between pre-scan PSA and the probability of identifying PSMA-avid disease suggestive of recurrent prostate cancer.  Results:   Two hundred and seventy-six patients met criteria for inclusion. The median PSA was 3.60 ng/mL. The overall detection rate for suspected recurrent prostate cancer was 86.3%. Local recurrence was the most common site, occurring in 56.9% (157/276) of men, with isolated local recurrence in 32.6% (90/276). A total of 75.3% (55/73) of men below Phoenix criteria had scans suggestive of recurrent disease, with 52.1% of men having salvageable disease. The regions surrounding the iliac arteries were the most common areas of nodal metastatic disease, with 55.6% of recurrence occurring in the iliac regions.  Conclusions: 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT frequently identifies suspected recurrent disease prior to the accepted Phoenix definition of PSA nadir +2. Prospective outcome studies are required to determine if early identification of local recurrence improves outcomes by increasing the use of salvage local treatments and whether earlier identification of metastatic disease may improve outcomes with prompt initiation of multimodality therapies.""","""['Sheliyan Raveenthiran', 'John Yaxley', 'Troy Gianduzzo', 'Boon Kua', 'Louise McEwan', 'David Wong', 'Gail Tsang', 'James MacKean']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Prostate Cancer Prostatic Dis""","""['The use of 68\xa0 Ga-PSMA PET CT in men with biochemical recurrence after definitive treatment of acinar prostate cancer.', 'Detection Efficacy of Hybrid 68Ga-PSMA Ligand PET/CT in Prostate Cancer Patients with Biochemical Recurrence After Primary Radiation Therapy Defined by Phoenix Criteria.', 'Risk of metastatic disease on 68 gallium-prostate-specific membrane antigen positron emission tomography/computed tomography scan for primary staging of 1253 men at the diagnosis of prostate cancer.', 'Use of gallium-68 prostate-specific membrane antigen positron-emission tomography for detecting lymph node metastases in primary and recurrent prostate cancer and location of recurrence after radical prostatectomy: an overview of the current literature.', 'The Impact of 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT and PET/MRI on the Management of Prostate Cancer.', 'Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy Salvage for Lymph Node Recurrent Prostate Cancer in the Era of PSMA PET Imaging.', 'A Risk Model for Patients with PSA-Only Recurrence (Biochemical Recurrence) Based on PSA and PSMA PET/CT: An Individual Patient Data Meta-Analysis.', 'Predicting Local Failure after Partial Prostate Re-Irradiation Using a Dosiomic-Based Machine Learning Model.', 'Oncological and urinary outcomes following low-dose-rate brachytherapy with a median follow-up of 11.8\u2009years.', 'The future of PSMA PET and WB MRI as next-generation imaging tools in prostate cancer.']"""

Treatment-refractory prostate cancers are increasingly associated with loss of luminal prostate markers, and in many cases induction of developmental programs, stem cell-like phenotypes, and neuroendocrine/neuronal features. Clinically, lineage plasticity may manifest as low PSA progression, resistance to androgen receptor (AR) pathway inhibitors, and sometimes small cell/neuroendocrine pathologic features observed on metastatic biopsy. This mechanism is not restricted to prostate cancer as other malignancies also demonstrate lineage plasticity during resistance to targeted therapies. At present, there is no established therapeutic approach for patients with advanced prostate cancer developing lineage plasticity or small cell neuroendocrine prostate cancer (NEPC) due to knowledge gaps in the underlying biology. Few clinical trials address questions in this space, and the outlook for patients remains poor. To move forward, urgently needed are: (i) a fundamental understanding of how lineage plasticity occurs and how it can best be defined; (ii) the temporal contribution and cooperation of emerging drivers; (iii) preclinical models that recapitulate biology of the disease and the recognized phenotypes; (iv) identification of therapeutic targets; and (v) novel trial designs dedicated to the entity as it is defined. This Perspective represents a consensus arising from the NCI Workshop on Lineage Plasticity and Androgen Receptor-Independent Prostate Cancer. We focus on the critical questions underlying lineage plasticity and AR-independent prostate cancer, outline knowledge and resource gaps, and identify strategies to facilitate future collaborative clinical translational and basic studies in this space.""","""['Himisha Beltran', 'Andrew Hruszkewycz', 'Howard I Scher', 'Jeffrey Hildesheim', 'Jennifer Isaacs', 'Evan Y Yu', 'Kathleen Kelly', 'Daniel Lin', 'Adam Dicker', 'Julia Arnold', 'Toby Hecht', 'Max Wicha', 'Rosalie Sears', 'David Rowley', 'Richard White', 'James L Gulley', 'John Lee', 'Maria Diaz Meco', 'Eric J Small', 'Michael Shen', 'Karen Knudsen', 'David W Goodrich', 'Tamara Lotan', 'Amina Zoubeidi', 'Charles L Sawyers', 'Charles M Rudin', 'Massimo Loda', 'Timothy Thompson', 'Mark A Rubin', 'Abdul Tawab-Amiri', 'William Dahut', 'Peter S Nelson']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Clin Cancer Res""","""['The Role of Epigenetic Change in Therapy-Induced Neuroendocrine Prostate Cancer Lineage Plasticity.', 'BET Bromodomain Inhibition Blocks an AR-Repressed, E2F1-Activated Treatment-Emergent Neuroendocrine Prostate Cancer Lineage Plasticity Program.', 'Cellular plasticity and the neuroendocrine phenotype in prostate cancer.', 'Clinical and Biological Features of Neuroendocrine Prostate Cancer.', 'Molecular model for neuroendocrine prostate cancer progression.', 'The Identification of CELSR3 and Other Potential Cell Surface Targets in Neuroendocrine Prostate Cancer.', 'Resveratrol as sensitizer in colorectal cancer plasticity.', ""Targeting Prostate Cancer, the 'Tousled Way'."", 'Androgen-regulated stromal complement component 7 (C7) suppresses prostate cancer growth.', 'Gene networks reveal stem-cell state convergence during preneoplasia and progression to malignancy in multistage skin carcinogenesis.']"""

Methods:   The incidence of hematologic, gastrointestinal, and other adverse events was identified, including events that led to treatment discontinuation or delay. Alterations in bone pain and prostate-specific antigen and serum alkaline phosphatase levels were evaluated. Bone scan changes were identified and correlated with the clinical course.  Results:   Sixty-eight patients were included in the study. The median number of radium-223 injections was 5 (range 1-6), with 69% of patients receiving 5 to 6 injections. The most common side effects were digestive alterations in 24 patients, anemia in 7 patients, and thrombocytopenia in 5 patients. Clear downward trends in serum alkaline phosphatase were seen, that were less clear in prostate-specific antigen. Mean serum alkaline phosphatase decreased from baseline in 77% of the patients, and prostate-specific antigen in less than 40%. The majority of patients (62) experienced an improvement in bone pain intensity or no increase in bone pain intensity. No prostate-specific antigen flare phenomenon was noted.  Conclusions:   Radium-223 was generally well tolerated and there were no safety concerns. The adverse events were mild and manageable. A decline in serum alkaline phosphatase was more common than a decline in prostate-specific antigen.

In addition, we investigated the repair of ex vivo induced DSB to investigate the repair proficiency in patient's lymphocytes over the therapy course.  Methods:   Before each of six therapy cycles, blood samples were obtained from seventeen patients. After separation of lymphocytes, the cells were subjected to immunofluorescence staining for detection of DSB-marking γH2AX foci. The number of foci per cell per patient sample was determined for each cycle (X1-X6, baseline foci per cell). Additionally, appropriate samples were exposed ex vivo to an X-ray dose of 1 Gy. The number of γH2AX foci per cell were analyzed after 0.5 h, 2 h and 24 h of recovery.  Results:   Patient-specific linear regression of the baseline foci per cell over the therapy cycles revealed no significant slopes in the regression lines. Likewise, the mean baseline foci per cell of all patients for cycles X2-X6 was not significantly elevated in comparison to the pre-therapeutic value (X1). The differences between the percentages of residual DSB and cycles were not significant, both at 2 h and 24 h repair time. Consideration of the X6/X1 ratios of both the number of lymphocytes and the amount of residual damage at 24 h indicated a significant correlation.

Patients and methods:   In all, 10 consecutive patients diagnosed with localised prostate cancer underwent extraperitoneal SP-RARP using the da Vinci SP® Surgical System (Intuitive Surgical, Sunnyvale, CA, USA). Exclusion criteria included previous surgery through an infra-umbilical midline incision, prostate size >100 g, or preoperative evidence of extraprostatic disease. All surgeries were performed by a single surgeon with previous experience of >3000 cases in robotic surgery. Demographics and perioperative information were collected including: operative time, estimated blood loss (EBL), complications, length of stay, and days with Foley catheter. The extraperitoneal SP-RARP is performed as follows. Firstly, a 3-cm incision ~2 cm below the umbilicus is made. Dissection of the extraperitoneal space is achieved using a kidney shaped Spacemaker™ balloon (Covidien, Dublin, Ireland), placed through the infra-umbilical incision caudally reaching the retropubic space. Thereafter, the balloon is deployed; the space is created and verified under direct vision with a laparoscopic endoscope. A GelPOINT® mini advanced access platform (Applied Medical, Rancho Santa Margarita, CA, USA) is inserted and a dedicated 25-mm multichannel port is placed with a 12-mm accessory laparoscopic port through the gel-seal cap into the same incision. The da Vinci SP surgical platform robot is docked with the patient in a supine position. RARP is performed replicating the technique previously described for multi-arm platforms or transperitoneal SP-RARP. No drain and no additional assistant ports were utilised.  Results:   The patient's ages ranged between 48 and 70 years, and the mean preoperative prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level was 9 ng/mL. No conversions or intraoperative complications were recorded. The median (interquartile range) operative time was 197.5 (185.5-229.7) min. EBL ranged between 50 and 400 mL, six patients were discharged on the same day as the surgery and the median time with a Foley catheter after surgery was 8 days.  Conclusions:   Extraperitoneal SP-RARP is a feasible and safe surgical option to treat localised prostate cancer. In our early experience, promising results and possible advantages were found such as: a small single incision, no additional ports, no Trendelenburg positioning, minimal postoperative pain and use of opioids, and same day discharge.

Loss of ARID1A protein expression in urine cytology may serve as an indication of an ARID1A mutation. Therefore, the authors examined the expression of ARID1A in urine cytology and histological specimens of bladder cancer for correlation with ARID1A mutational status.  Methods:   The authors constructed a tissue microarray containing samples from 164 tissue samples from 150 patients with NMIBC and 100 tissue samples from 81 patients with muscle-invasive bladder cancer. A second cohort consisted of archived cytological specimens and matched tissue sections from 62 patients with high-grade NMIBC. The authors established immunohistochemistry and immunocytochemistry (ICC) protocols, respectively, for the analysis of ARID1A protein expression in histological and cytological specimens. Confirmatory next-generation sequencing (NGS) was performed on tumor specimens using a targeted NGS panel containing all exonic regions of ARID1A.  Results:   The prevalence of ARID1A loss of expression on the tissue microarray was 3.6% in NMIBC (6 of 164 tissue samples) and 10% in muscle-invasive bladder cancer (10 of 100 tissue samples) (P = .059). Loss of ARID1A expression in cytology was concordantly immunohistochemistry negative in 6 of 8 matched tissue specimens. NGS confirmed an ARID1A mutation on all 6 histology samples with loss of ARID1A expression. When NGS demonstrated an absence of ARID1A mutation, histology was concordantly positive (16 of 16 cases).  Conclusions:   The authors have suggest ARID1A ICC as a promising surrogate marker for ARID1A mutational status in patients with urothelial carcinoma.

Moreover, they are also used as a better alternative to conventional therapies since; these are non-toxic to cells and having no or least side effects. Notably, the pertinent therapeutic role of Rutin in cervical cancer is still unsettled however, its anti-cancerous role has already been reported in other cancers including prostate and colon cancer.

Objective:   Despite the evidence for its several biological activities, the anticancer effects of Rutin on human cervical cancer (C33A) cells remain to be explored. In this study, the anticancer potential of Rutin was investigated by employing the key biomarkers such as nuclear condensation reactive oxygen species (ROS), apoptosis, and changes in mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP).  Results:   Our findings showed that Rutin treatment reduced the cell viability, induced significant increase in ROS production and nuclear condensation in dose-dependent manner. Moreover, Rutin provoked apoptosis by inducing decrease in MMP and activation of caspase-3. Cell cycle analysis further confirmed the efficacy of Rutin by showing cell cycle arrest at G0/G1 phase.  Conclusion:   Thus, our study is envisaged to open up interests for elucidating Rutin as an anticancerous agent against cervical cancer.""","""['Fahad Khan', 'Pratibha Pandey', 'Tarun K Upadhyay', 'Asif Jafri', 'Niraj K Jha', 'Rashmi Mishra', 'Vineeta Singh']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Endocr Metab Immune Disord Drug Targets""","""['Glycyrrhizin induces reactive oxygen species-dependent apoptosis and cell cycle arrest at G0/G1 in HPV18+ human cervical cancer HeLa cell line.', ""Elucidation of rutin's role in inducing caspase-dependent apoptosis via HPV-E6 and E7 down-regulation in cervical cancer HeLa cells."", 'Genistein induced anticancer effects on pancreatic cancer cell lines involves mitochondrial apoptosis, G0/G1cell cycle arrest and regulation of STAT3 signalling pathway.', 'Anticancer Effects of Herbal Medicine Compounds and Novel Formulations: a Literature Review.', 'Use of artemisinin and its derivatives to treat HPV-infected/transformed cells and cervical cancer: a review.', 'Immunomodulatory, Anticancer, and Antimicrobial Effects of Rice Bran Grown in Iraq: An In Vitro and In Vivo Study.', 'Fermented Mangosteen (Garcinia mangostana L.)

Methods:   Among 614 histopathologically confirmed APCs from 2011 to 2016, 221 lesions with PiRADS (verion 2) scores ≥ 4 on 3-T multi-parametric MRI were analyzed retrospectively. Two radiologists independently assessed capsular morphology qualitatively with 5-point scale (normal, thinning, bulging, loss, extracapsular disease), and capsule contact length (arc), tumor dimension, and their ratio (arc-dimension ratio) quantitatively. Reproducibility in measurement was assessed with κ and intra-class correlation coefficients (ICCs). Logistic regression analysis was done to find meaningful indicators of EPE. Diagnostic performance of markers was compared to one another with generalized linear model and multi-reader multi-case ROC analysis.  Results:   Reproducibility was moderate to substantial (κ 0.45-0.73) for qualitative, and moderate to almost perfect (ICC 0.50-0.87) for quantitative features of EPE. Capsular morphology (odds ratio [OR] 1.818), capsule contact length (OR 1.115), tumor dimension (OR 1.035), and arc-dimension ratio (OR 1.846) were independently associated with EPE (p ≤ 0.019). Capsular bulging and capsule contact length of 10 mm as thresholds of EPE demonstrated sensitivity/specificity of 0.58/0.85 and 0.77/0.68, respectively. Capsule contact length yielded greatest AUC (0.784), followed by capsular morphology (0.778), arc-dimension ratio (0.749), and tumor dimension (0.741). Diagnostic performance of capsular morphology, capsule contact length, and arc-dimension ratio was comparable in predicting EPE.  Conclusions:   Existing markers of EPE applicable regardless of locations of tumors apply similarly to APCs. Arc-dimension ratio may be a novel marker of EPE of APCs.  Key points:   • Existing imaging markers of extraprostatic extension (EPE) which have been applied regardless of locations of tumors are reflected similarly to anterior prostate cancers (APCs). • Measuring tumor dimension without capsular assessment may result in insufficient pre-operative prediction of EPE of APCs. • Arc-dimension ratio (capsule contact length divided by tumor dimension) exhibited highest OR and comparable performance to existing features in predicting EPE of APCs.""","""['Hyungwoo Ahn', 'Sung Il Hwang', 'Hak Jong Lee', 'Hyoung Sim Suh', 'Gheeyoung Choe', 'Seok-Soo Byun', 'Sung Kyu Hong', 'Sangchul Lee', 'Joongyub Lee']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Eur Radiol""","""['Evaluation of the most optimal multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging sequence for determining pathological length of capsular contact.', 'Length of capsular contact for diagnosing extraprostatic extension on prostate MRI: Assessment at an optimal threshold.', 'Extraprostatic Tumor Extension: Comparison of Preoperative Multiparametric MRI Criteria and Histopathologic Correlation after Radical Prostatectomy.', 'Extraprostatic extension in prostate cancer: primer for radiologists.', 'Multiparametric MRI in detection and staging of prostate cancer.', 'Imaging features of the PI-RADS for predicting extraprostatic extension of prostate cancer: systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Diagnostic Performance of Extraprostatic Extension Grading System for Detection of Extraprostatic Extension in Prostate Cancer: A Diagnostic Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.', 'The Quantitative Assessment of Using Multiparametric MRI for Prediction of Extraprostatic Extension in Patients Undergoing Radical Prostatectomy: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.']"""

Options for early detection of other cancers (e.g. hepatocellular carcinoma and melanoma) are under investigation. This study provides an overview of the health benefits, harms and cost-effectiveness of population-level breast, cervical and colorectal cancer screening, targeted-risk screening for lung cancer and Lynch syndrome, and prostate specific antigen (PSA) testing in Australia.  Methods:   The study reviewed and, where possible, updated the estimated health benefits, harms and cost-effectiveness of screening approaches from modelling studies for four cancer types, PSA testing and Lynch syndrome testing in Australia. Costs are presented in 2018 Australian dollars.  Results:   The renewed NCSP (for women not HPV-vaccinated) and the NBCSP were estimated to be cost-effective versus no screening; the cost-effectiveness ratio (CER) was $16 632 per life-year saved (LYS) for the NCSP, and $3380/LYS for the NBCSP. BreastScreen Australia was predicted to have a CER of $40 279/LYS-$65 065/LYS. In 2017, the NCSP transitioned to 5-yearly primary HPV testing with partial genotyping for HPV types 16 and 18 for women aged 25-74 years. Alongside vaccination, this change is predicted to prevent a further 587 cervical cancer deaths in 2018-2035, and have a favourable benefit-to-harm balance versus prior practice (biennial cytology testing for women aged 18-69 years). On average, the NBCSP (biennial screening using an immunochemical faecal occult blood test for people aged 50-74 years) is estimated to prevent 2519 colorectal cancer deaths and result in 350 colonoscopy-related adverse events annually. The inaccuracy of PSA testing as a screening tool impedes the capacity to conduct meaningful cost-effectiveness analyses at a population level, based on current evidence. Three annual low-dose computed tomography screens for lung cancer using the US National Lung Screening Trial selection criteria would not be cost-effective in Australia. A comprehensive cost-effectiveness evaluation of systematic proband testing, cascade testing and subsequent surveillance for Lynch syndrome in Australia is currently underway.  Conclusions:   Current evidence supports a favourable cost-effectiveness and benefit-to-harm balance for the NCSP and NBCSP. An updated cost-effectiveness and benefits-to-harms analysis for BreastScreen Australia is required. Carefully founded quantitative estimates of health benefits, harms and cost-effectiveness provide an important aid to policy decision making, and form the basis for developing decision aids to guide individual screening decisions. Opportunities exist for lung cancer screening, systematic Lynch syndrome testing and informed decision making about PSA testing. However, more evidence is required on risk assessment, targeting of screening tests, optimal referral pathways, managing potential harms and delivering services in a cost-effective framework.""","""['Jie-Bin Lew', 'Eleanor Feletto', 'Stephen Wade', 'Michael Caruana', 'Yoon-Jung Kang', 'Carolyn Nickson', 'Kate T Simms', 'Pietro Procopio', 'Natalie Taylor', 'Joachim Worthington', 'David Smith', 'Karen Canfell']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Public Health Res Pract""","""['Long-term evaluation of benefits, harms, and cost-effectiveness of the National Bowel Cancer Screening Program in Australia: a modelling study.', 'History, development and future of cancer screening in Australia.', 'Evaluation of the benefits, harms and cost-effectiveness of potential alternatives to iFOBT testing for colorectal cancer screening in Australia.', 'Responsible cancer screening.', 'Screening for cancer in low- and middle-income countries.', 'Potential global loss of life expected due to COVID-19 disruptions to organised colorectal cancer screening.', 'The high burden of comorbidities in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians living with chronic hepatitis B in Far North Queensland, Australia, and the implications for patient management.', 'Acceptability of risk stratification within population-based cancer screening from the perspective of the general public: A mixed-methods systematic review.', 'Acceptability of risk stratification within population-based cancer screening from the perspective of healthcare professionals: A mixed methods systematic review and recommendations to support implementation.', 'Optimization of a Quality Improvement Tool for Cancer Diagnosis in Primary Care: Qualitative Study.']"""

Simulation models of the natural history of disease can play a role in quantifying harms and benefits of cancer screening scenarios. Recently, the US Preventive Services Task Force issued a C-recommendation on screening for prostate cancer for men aged 55-69 years, implying at least moderate certainty that the benefit is small. However, modelling based on data from the European Randomized study of Screening for Prostate Cancer, which included quality-of-life estimates, showed that the ratio between benefits and harms is better, and likely to be reasonable, for men screened between the ages of 55 and 63 years (i.e. by using an earlier stopping age than applied in the trial setting). This commentary article considers the importance of simulation modelling in the decision-making process for (prostate) cancer screening.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the role of Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System version 2 (PI-RADSv2) scores for estimating the risk of LN metastasis. The study also aimed to investigate the additional value of PI-RADSv2 scores when used in combination with clinical nomograms for the prediction of LNI in patients with PCa.  Methods:   We retrospectively identified 308 patients who underwent multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) and RP with pelvic lymph node dissection (PLND). Clinicopathological parameters and PI-RADSv2 scores were assessed. Univariate and multivariate logistic analyses were performed. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUCs) and decision curve analysis (DCA) were generated for assessing the incremental value of PI-RADSv2 scores combined with the Briganti and Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) nomograms.  Results:   Overall, 20 (6.5%) patients had LNI. At univariate analysis, all clinicopathological characteristics and PI-RADSv2 scores were significantly associated to LNI (p < 0.04). However, multivariate analysis revealed that only PI-RADSv2 scores and percentage of positive cores were independently significant (p ≤ 0.006). The PI-RADSv2 score was the most accurate predictor (AUC, 80.2%). The threshold of PI-RADSv2 score was 5, which provided high sensitivity (18/20, 90.0%) and negative predictive value (203/205, 99.0%). When PI-RADSv2 scores were combined with Briganti and MSKCC nomograms, the AUC value increased from 75.1 to 86.3% and from 79.2 to 87.9%, respectively (p ≤ 0.001). The DCA also demonstrated that the two nomograms plus PI-RADSv2 scores improved clinical risk prediction of LNI.  Conclusions:   The patients with a PI-RADSv2 score <5 were associated with a very low risk of LNI in PCa.

Herein, we characterized the stability of luciferase reporter systems in C4-2B prostate cancer cells in mono-culture and in co-culture with bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (BMSC). An assumption made when employing the luciferase reporter is that the luciferase expressing cell number and bioluminescence signal are linearly proportional. We observed instances where luciferase expression was significantly upregulated in C4-2B cell populations when co-cultured with BMSC, resulting in a significant disconnect between bioluminescence signal and cell number. We subsequently characterized luciferase reporter stability in a second C4-2B reporter cell line, and six other cancer cell lines. All but the single C4-2B reporter cell population had stable luciferase reporter expression in mono-culture and BMSC co-culture. Whole-genome sequencing revealed that relative number of luciferase gene insertions per genome in the unstable C4-2B reporter cell population was lesser than stable C4-2B, PC3 and MD-MBA-231 luciferase reporter cell lines. We reasoned that the low luciferase gene copy number and genome insertion locations likely contributed to the reporter gene expression being exquisitely sensitive BMSC paracrine signals. In this study, we show that it is possible to generate a range of stable and reliable luciferase reporter prostate- and breast- cancer cell populations but advise not to assume stability across different culture conditions.

Methods:   Quantitative methylation-specific PCR was applied for the methylation analysis of RARB, RASSF1, and GSTP1 in 514 preoperatively collected voided or catheterized urine samples from the single-centre cohort of 1056 treatment-naïve PCa patients who underwent RP.

DNA methylation changes in at least one gene were detected in more than 80% of urine samples. Combination of the PSA test with the three-gene methylation analysis in urine was a significant predictor of pathological upstaging and upgrading (P < 0.050), however, with limited increase in overall accuracy. The PSA test or each gene alone was not informative enough.

Our aim was to investigate whether there is any association between PCa screening frequency or previous negative prostate biopsy and uptake of AS among men with low risk PCa.  Methods:   This register-based study included all men ≤75 years from Stockholm who were diagnosed with low risk PCa from 2008 to 2014 (n = 4336). Pre-diagnostic PSA testing and biopsy histories were obtained from the Stockholm PSA and Biopsy Register, a population-based register for the Stockholm country. The association between previous screening/biopsy history and AS uptake (based on primary treatment recorded in the National Prostate Cancer Register) was examined using multivariable logistic regression.  Results:   Forty seven percent of men with low risk PCa underwent AS. Uptake was associated with older age, very low risk disease, more recent diagnosis and absence of family history. None of the screening/biopsy measures (testing frequency, mean interval, PSA velocity, highest pre-diagnostic PSA or prior negative biopsy) were associated with uptake of AS among men with low risk PCa.

Alterations in master genes lead to mitochondrial metabolic rewiring and provide an appealing target to inhibit cancer progression and improve survival. Phospholipase C (PLC)ε is a regulator of tumor generation and progression. However, its role in mitochondrial metabolism remains unclear.  Methods:   The GEO, The Cancer Genome Atlas, and the GTEx databases were used to determine Twist1 mRNA levels in tumors and their non-tumor counterparts. Fifty-five PCa and 48 benign prostatic hypertrophy tissue samples were tested for the presence of PLCε and Twist1 immunohistochemically. An association between PLCε and Twist1 was determined by Pearson's correlation analysis. PLCε was knocked down with a lentiviral short hairpin RNA. Mitochondrial activity was assessed by measuring the oxygen consumption rate. Western blotting analyses were used to measure levels of PPARβ, Twist1, phosphorylated (p)-Twist1, p-MEK, p-ERK, p-P38, and p-c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK). Cells were treated with inhibitors of MEK, JNK, and P38 MAPK, and an agonist and inhibitor of peroxisome proliferator activated receptor (PPAR) β, to evaluate which signaling pathways were involved in PLCε-mediated Twist1 expression. The stability of Twist1 was determined after blocking protein synthesis with cycloheximide. Reporter assays utilized E-cadherin or N-cadherin luciferase reporters under depletion of PLCε or Twist1. Transwell assays assessed cell migration. Finally, a nude mouse tumor xenograft assay was conducted to verify the role of PLCε in tumor formation.  Results:   Our findings revealed that the expression of PLCε was positively associated with Twist1 in clinical PCa samples. PLCε knockdown promoted mitochondrial oxidative metabolism in PCa cells. Mechanistically, PLCε increased phosphorylation of Twist1 and stabilized the Twist1 protein through MAPK signaling. The transcriptional activity of Twist1, and the Twist1-mediated epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, cell migration, and transcription regulation, were suppressed by PLCε knockdown and by blocking PPARβ nuclear translocation. The tumor xenograft assay demonstrated that PLCε depletion diminished PCa cell tumorigenesis.  Conclusions:   These findings reveal an undiscovered physiological role for PLCε in the suppression of mitochondrial oxidative metabolism that has significant implications for understanding PCa occurrence and migration.""","""['Jiaxin Fan', 'Yanru Fan', 'Xiao Wang', 'Lingfang Niu', 'Limei Duan', 'Jinxiao Yang', 'Luo Li', 'Yingying Gao', 'Xiaohou Wu', 'Chunli Luo']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""J Exp Clin Cancer Res""","""['Phospholipase Cε Regulates Prostate Cancer Lipid Metabolism and Proliferation by Targeting AMP-Activated Protein Kinase (AMPK)/Sterol Regulatory Element-Binding Protein 1 (SREBP-1) Signaling Pathway.', 'A ROS/STAT3/HIF-1α signaling cascade mediates EGF-induced TWIST1 expression and prostate cancer cell invasion.', 'Sox5 contributes to prostate cancer metastasis and is a master regulator of TGF-β-induced epithelial mesenchymal transition through controlling Twist1 expression.', 'The role of TWIST1 in epithelial-mesenchymal transition and cancers.', 'Targeting Mitochondrial Metabolism in Prostate Cancer with Triterpenoids.', 'Analysis of Long Noncoding RNAs-Related Regulatory Mechanisms in Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy Using a Disease-Related lncRNA-mRNA Pathway Network.', 'Inhibition of the Phospholipase Cε-c-Jun N-Terminal Kinase Axis Suppresses Glioma Stem Cell Properties.', 'Ajuba transactivates N-cadherin expression in colorectal cancer cells through interaction with Twist.', 'Phospholipase C-ε regulates bladder cancer cells via ATM/EXO1.', 'PLCε knockdown enhances the radiosensitivity of castration‑resistant prostate cancer via the AR/PARP1/DNA‑PKcs axis.']"""

Methods:   Observational, prospective study conducted in patients with histologically or cytologically confirmed prostate adenocarcinoma; documented metastatic castration-resistant disease; progression after first-line, docetaxel-based chemotherapy with or without other agents.  Results:   Of the 150 patients recruited into the study, 100 patients were prescribed abiraterone acetate plus prednisone (AAP), 44 patients received cabazitaxel plus prednisone (CP), and 6 patients received other treatments.

Small-molecule CDK8/19 inhibitors have recently entered or are entering clinical trials, starting with breast cancer and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). To identify other cancers where these novel drugs may provide benefit, we queried genomic and transcriptomic databases for potential impact of CDK8, CDK19, or their binding partner CCNC. sgRNA analysis of a panel of tumor cell lines showed that most tumor types represented in the panel, except for some central nervous system tumors, were not dependent on these genes. In contrast, analysis of clinical samples for alterations in these genes revealed a high frequency of gene amplification in two highly aggressive subtypes of prostate cancer and in some cancers of the GI tract, breast, bladder, and sarcomas. Analysis of survival correlations identified a group of cancers where CDK8 expression correlated with shorter survival (notably breast, prostate, cervical cancers, and esophageal adenocarcinoma). In some cancers (AML, melanoma, ovarian, and others), such correlations were limited to samples with a below-median tumor mutation burden. These results suggest that Mediator kinases are especially important in cancers that are driven primarily by transcriptional rather than mutational changes and warrant an investigation of their role in additional cancer types.""","""['Igor B Roninson', 'Balázs Győrffy', 'Zachary T Mack', 'Alexander A Shtil', 'Michael S Shtutman', 'Mengqian Chen', 'Eugenia V Broude']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Cells""","""['Expression of CDK8 and CDK8-interacting Genes as Potential Biomarkers in Breast Cancer.', 'Oncogenic exon 2 mutations in Mediator subunit MED12 disrupt allosteric activation of cyclin C-CDK8/19.', 'Pan-Cancer Analysis of the Mediator Complex Transcriptome Identifies CDK19 and CDK8 as Therapeutic Targets in Advanced Prostate Cancer.', 'Mediator cyclin-dependent kinases upregulate transcription of inflammatory genes in cooperation with NF-κB and C/EBPβ on stimulation of Toll-like receptor 9.', 'Binding patterns and structure-activity relationship of CDK8 inhibitors.', 'Inhibition of Cyclin-Dependent Kinases 8/19 Restricts Bacterial and Virus-Induced Inflammatory Responses in Monocytes.', 'Pyrazolo4,3-etetrazolo1,5-b1,2,4triazine Sulfonamides as Novel Potential Anticancer Agents: Apoptosis, Oxidative Stress, and Cell Cycle Analysis.', 'Relationship of micro-RNA, mRNA and eIF Expression in Tamoxifen-Adapted MCF-7 Breast Cancer Cells: Impact of miR-1972 on Gene Expression, Proliferation and Migration.', 'The Mediator complex as a master regulator of transcription by RNA polymerase II.', 'The Mediator kinase module: an interface between cell signaling and transcription.']"""

To evaluate the clinical relevance of S100A8 expression in prostate cancer, a tissue microarray containing 13,665 tumors was analyzed by immunohistochemistry. Cytoplasmic S100A8 staining was compared to prostate cancer phenotype, patient prognosis and molecular features including TMPRSS2:ERG fusion status and deletions of PTEN, 3p, 5q and 6q. S100A8 immunostaining was typically seen in normal prostate tissue but lost in 60% of 9786 interpretable prostate cancers. In the remaining tumors, S100A8 was considered weak in 17.9%, moderate in 17.8% and strong in 5.4% of cases. Loss of S100A8 expression was linked to advanced tumor stage, high Gleason grade, positive nodal status, positive surgical margin and high preoperative PSA (P < .0001 each). In addition, loss of S100A8 expression was associated with TMPRSS2:ERG fusions (P < .0001), deletions of PTEN, 3p, and 6q (P < .005), and a high number of genomic deletions per tumor (P = .0009). Absence of S100A8 immunostaining was also linked to an elevated risk for early PSA recurrence (P < .0001). In a multivariate analysis limited to features that are preoperatively available, the prognostic impact of S100A8 expression (P < .0001) was independent of clinical stage, Gleason grade, and serum PSA level (P < .0001).

Development of targeted therapy brought attention on detecting novel gene fusions, since they represent promising therapeutic targets (eg, TRK inhibitors in NTRK fusion-positive tumors). Using targeted next-generation sequencing, we prospectively analyzed 205 primary brain tumors and detected a novel PTPRZ1-ETV1 fusion transcript in 11 of 191 (5.8%) gliomas, including nine glioblastomas, one anaplastic oligodendroglioma and one pilocytic astrocytoma. PTPRZ1-ETV1 fusion was confirmed by RT-PCR followed by Sanger sequencing, and in-silico analysis predicted a potential driver role. The newly detected fusion consists of the PTPRZ1 promoter in frame with the highly conserved DNA-binding domain of ETV1 transcription factor. The ETV1 and PTPRZ1 genes are known oncogenes, involved in processes of tumor development. ETV1 is a member of the ETS family of transcription factors, already known oncogenic drivers in Ewing sarcoma, prostate cancer and gastrointestinal stromal tumors, but not in gliomas. Its overexpression contributes to tumor growth and more aggressive tumor behavior. PTPRZ1 is already considered to be a tumor growth promoting oncogene in gliomas. In 8%-16% of gliomas, PTPRZ1 is fused to the MET oncogene, resulting in a PTPRZ1-MET fusion, which is associated with poorer prognosis but is also a positive predictive biomarker for treatment with kinase inhibitors. In view of the oncogenic role that the two fusion partners, PTPRZ1 and ETV1, exhibit in other malignancies, PTPRZ1-ETV1 fusion might present a novel potential therapeutic target in gliomas. Although histopathological examination of PTPRZ1-ETV1 fusion-positive gliomas did not reveal any specific or unique pathological features, and the follow-up period was too short to assess prognostic value of the fusion, careful monitoring of patients and their response to therapy might provide additional insights into the prognostic and predictive value of this novel fusion.""","""['Alenka Matjašič', 'Andrej Zupan', 'Emanuela Boštjančič', 'Jože Pižem', 'Mara Popović', 'Danijela Kolenc']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Brain Pathol""","""['Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase Receptor Zeta 1 as a Potential Target in Cancer Therapy and Diagnosis.', 'Glioblastomas harboring gene fusions detected by next-generation sequencing.', 'RNA-seq of 272 gliomas revealed a novel, recurrent PTPRZ1-MET fusion transcript in secondary glioblastomas.', 'Molecular and clinicopathologic features of gliomas harboring NTRK fusions.', 'Targeting gene fusions in glioma.', 'Reflection on my 37 years of practice as a neuropathologist: Home alone.', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase Receptor Zeta 1 as a Potential Target in Cancer Therapy and Diagnosis.', 'The oncogenic fusion landscape in pediatric CNS neoplasms.', 'Protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type Z1 inhibits the cisplatin resistance of ovarian cancer by regulating PI3K/AKT/mTOR signal pathway.', 'The EGFRvIII transcriptome in glioblastoma: A meta-omics analysis.']"""

Here, we found that there was a significant correlation between MMP9 and AR protein expression in primary and metastatic PCa tissues, and a trend that high level of MMP9 expression was associated with poor prognosis. We demonstrated that constitutive activation of AR increased expression of MMP9 and VEGF/VEGF receptors. We further showed that AR exerts its effect on MMP9/VEGF signaling axis through PIP5K1α/AKT. We showed that MMP9 physically interacted with PIP5K1α via formation of protein-protein complexes. Furthermore, elevated expression of MMP9 enhanced ability of AR to activate its target gene cyclin A1. The elevated sequential activation of AR/PIP5K1α/AKT/MMP9/VEGF signaling axis contributed to increased invasiveness and growth of metastatic tumors. Conversely, treatment with PIP5K1α inhibitor significantly suppressed invasiveness of PCa cells expressing constitutively activated AR, this was coincident with its inhibitory effect of this inhibitor on AR/MMP9/VEGF pathways.

Patients and methods:   The expression level of miR-1266 and protein arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5) in PCa tissues and cell lines was first detected by quantitative Real Time-Polymerase Chain Reaction (qRT-PCR). After up-regulating or down-regulating miR-1266 expression in cells, cell proliferation, migration and invasion abilities were detected. Possible target genes of miR-1266 were predicted and validated by bioinformatics analysis and dual-luciferase reporter gene assay, respectively. Finally, abnormal expression of PRMT5 was ascertained after transfection.  Results:   MiR-1266 was lowly expressed in PCa tissues and cell lines, whereas PRMT5 exhibited the opposite results. Up-regulated expression of miR-1266 significantly inhibited the proliferation, migration and invasion abilities of PC-3 cells. However, the growth and migration of DU145 cells with low miR-1266 expression were significantly accelerated. Meanwhile, the number of invading cells was significantly increased.

Objective:   To examine associations of prediagnostic plasma metabolomic profiles with advanced and fatal prostate cancer.  Design, setting, and participants:   In a case-cohort study of the Cancer Prevention Study-II Nutrition Cohort, of 14 210 cancer-free men with a blood sample in 1998-2001, 129 were diagnosed with advanced prostate cancer (T3-T4 or N1 or M1) through June 2013 and 112 died from prostate cancer through December 2014. Plasma samples from advanced and fatal cases, and a randomly selected subcohort of 347 men were metabolically profiled using untargeted mass spectroscopy-based platforms.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Prentice-weighted Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to assess associations of 699 known metabolites with advanced and fatal prostate cancer.  Results and limitations:   Two metabolites derived from fatty acid metabolism (ethylmalonate and butyrylcarnitine), aspartate, sphingomyelin (d18:1/18:0), and two γ-glutamyl amino acids (γ-glutamylmethionine and γ-glutamylglutamine) were statistically significantly associated (false discovery rate <0.2) with fatal prostate cancer. One standard deviation (SD) increase in each γ-glutamyl amino acid was associated with 34-38% decreased risk, whereas one SD increase in each of the other metabolites was associated with 45-53% increased risk. A metabolic risk score based on four of these metabolites (excluding butyrylcarnitine and γ-glutamylglutamine, which were not independent predictors) was strongly associated with fatal prostate cancer (relative risk per SD: 2.72, 95% confidence interval: 2.05-3.60). No metabolites were statistically significantly associated with advanced prostate cancer. These results were observational and may not be causal.  Conclusions:   These findings identified metabolic pathways that are altered in the development of fatal prostate cancer. Further research into these pathways may provide insights into the etiology of fatal prostate cancer.  Patient summary:   In a large follow-up study of cancer-free men, those with a certain metabolomic profile had a higher risk of dying from prostate cancer.""","""['Ying Wang', 'Eric J Jacobs', 'Brian D Carter', 'Susan M Gapstur', 'Victoria L Stevens']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Eur Urol Oncol""","""['Identification of prediagnostic metabolites associated with prostate cancer risk by untargeted mass spectrometry-based metabolomics: A case-control study nested in the Northern Sweden Health and Disease Study.', 'Metabolomic profile of prostate cancer-specific survival among 1812 Finnish men.', 'A prospective case-cohort analysis of plasma metabolites and breast cancer risk.', 'Translational Metabolomics of Head Injury: Exploring Dysfunctional Cerebral Metabolism with Ex Vivo NMR Spectroscopy-Based Metabolite Quantification.', 'Application of metabolomics to prostate cancer.', 'Integrated Microbiota and Metabolite Changes following Rice Bran Intake during Murine Inflammatory Colitis-Associated Colon Cancer and in Colorectal Cancer Survivors.', 'Caprylic Acid (FFA C8:0) promotes the progression of prostate cancer by up-regulating G protein-coupled receptor 84/ Krüppel-like factor 7.', 'Relationship between 4-Hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) as Systemic Biomarker of Lipid Peroxidation and Metabolomic Profiling of Patients with Prostate Cancer.', 'Liquid chromatography coupled to high-resolution mass spectrometry metabolomics: A useful tool for investigating tumor secretome based on a three-dimensional co-culture model.', 'Identification of prediagnostic metabolites associated with prostate cancer risk by untargeted mass spectrometry-based metabolomics: A case-control study nested in the Northern Sweden Health and Disease Study.']"""

Widespread implementation of imaging technologies, such as mp-MRI raises considerable logistical challenges. Our objective was to evaluate a biopsy strategy that utilizes selective mp-MRI as a follow-up test to biomarkers to improve the detection of significant prostate cancer.  Methods and materials:   We developed a conceptual approach based on the risk calculated from the 4Kscore using results from the US prospective validation study, multiplied by the likelihood ratio of mp-MRI from the PROMIS trial. The primary outcome was Gleason grade ≥ 7 (grade group ≥ 2) cancer on biopsy. Using decision curve analysis, the net benefit was determined for our model and compared with the use of the 4Kscore and mp-MRI independently at various thresholds for biopsy.  Results:   For a cut-point of 7.5% risk of high-grade disease, patients with <5% risk from a blood marker would not have risk of significant prostate cancer sufficiently increased by a positive mp-MRI to warrant biopsy; comparably, patients with a risk >23% would not have risk sufficiently reduced by a negative imaging study to forgo biopsy. From the 4Kscore validation study, 46% of men considered for biopsy in the US have risks 5% to 23%. Net benefit was highest for the combined strategy, followed by 4Kscore alone.  Conclusions:   Selective mp-MRI in men with intermediate scores on a secondary blood test results in a biopsy strategy that is more scalable than mp-MRI for all men with elevated PSA. Prospective validation is required to demonstrate if the predicted properties of combined blood and imaging testing are empirically confirmed.""","""['Karim Marzouk', 'Behfar Ehdaie', 'Emily Vertosick', 'Stephen Zappala', 'Andrew Vickers']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Urol Oncol""","""['Clinical Utility of 4Kscore®, ExosomeDx™ and Magnetic Resonance Imaging for the Early Detection of High Grade Prostate Cancer.', 'Using biomarkers in patients with positive multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging: 4Kscore predicts the presence of cancer outside the index lesion.', 'Multiparametric MRI in detection and staging of prostate cancer.', ""Optimizing patient's selection for prostate biopsy: A single institution experience with multi-parametric MRI and the 4Kscore test for the detection of aggressive prostate cancer."", 'PI-RADS Steering Committee: The PI-RADS Multiparametric MRI and MRI-directed Biopsy Pathway.', 'Comparative Analysis of PSA Density and an MRI-Based Predictive Model to Improve the Selection of Candidates for Prostate Biopsy.', 'Improving the Early Detection of Clinically Significant Prostate Cancer in Men in the Challenging Prostate Imaging-Reporting and Data System 3 Category.', 'Prostate cancer biomarkers and multiparametric MRI: is there a role for both in prostate cancer management?', 'Commercialized Blood-, Urinary- and Tissue-Based Biomarker Tests for Prostate Cancer Diagnosis and Prognosis.', 'PSA Based Biomarkers, Imagistic Techniques and Combined Tests for a Better Diagnostic of Localized Prostate Cancer.']"""

Materials and methods:   The Canadian hereditary RCC risk criteria were applied to patients from 16 centres in the Canadian Kidney Cancer information system (CKCis) prospective database. The primary end point was the proportion of patients who met at least one criterion.  Results:   Between January 2011 and May 2017, 8388 patients were entered in the database; 291 had inadequate risk data; 2827 (35%) met at least one criterion for genetic testing (at-risk population). Most (83%) met just one criterion. The criterion of non-clear cell histology contributed the largest proportion of at-risk patients (59%), followed by age ≤ 45 years (28%). Sixty-one patients had documentation of genetic testing, with 56 being classified at-risk (2% of at-risk). Twenty patients (35%) of the patients at risk and tested for hereditary RCC were found to harbour a germline mutation.  Conclusions:   Application of the Canadian hereditary RCC risk criteria to a large prospective database resulted in 35% of patients being identified at risk for hereditary RCC who could qualify for genetic testing. However, the true incidence of hereditary RCC in this population is unknown as most patients did not have documented genetic testing carried out and, thus, the sensitivity and specificity of the criteria cannot be determined.

A full description of the clinical features of aLQTS associated with ADT and of underlying mechanisms is lacking.  Methods:   We searched the international pharmacovigilance database VigiBase for men (n=6 560 565 individual case safety reports) presenting with aLQTS, TdP, or sudden death associated with ADT. In cardiomyocytes derived from induced pluripotent stem cells from men, we studied electrophysiological effects of ADT and dihydrotestosterone.  Results:   Among subjects receiving ADT in VigiBase, we identified 184 cases of aLQTS (n=168) and/or TdP (n=68; 11% fatal), and 99 with sudden death. Of the 10 ADT drugs examined, 7 had a disproportional association (reporting odds ratio=1.4-4.7; P<0.05) with aLQTS, TdP, or sudden death. The minimum and median times to sudden death were 0.25 and 92 days, respectively. The androgen receptor antagonist enzalutamide was associated with more deaths (5430/31 896 [17%]; P<0.0001) than other ADT used for prostate cancer (4208/52 089 [8.1%]). In induced pluripotent stem cells, acute and chronic enzalutamide (25 µM) significantly prolonged action potential durations (action potential duration at 90% when paced at 0.5 Hz; 429.7±27.1 (control) versus 982.4±33.2 (acute, P<0.001) and 1062.3±28.9 ms (chronic; P<0.001), and generated afterdepolarizations and/or triggered activity in drug-treated cells (11/20 acutely and 8/15 chronically). Enzalutamide acutely and chronically inhibited delayed rectifier potassium current, and chronically enhanced late sodium current. Dihydrotestosterone (30 nM) reversed enzalutamide electrophysiological effects on induced pluripotent stem cells.

Mapping the lymphatic drainage from the prostate can help to identify the LNs directly draining from the tumour (sentinel nodes (SNs)); the LNs stated to have the highest chance of containing metastatic cancer cells. Although the lymphatic drainage may differ between segments within the prostate, the location of the primary tumour is not routinely taken into account during peripheral zone-aimed tracer administration. This study evaluates whether linking the SN procedure to the primary cancer deposits increases the identification accuracy of lymphatic metastases.  Methods:   Sixty-seven PCa patients, scheduled for robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy (RALP) and extended lymph node dissection (ePLND) with subsequent SN biopsy, were included in this retrospective study. After injection of the hybrid tracer ICG-99mTc-nanocolloid in the prostate, SN mapping was performed based on lymphoscintigraphy and SPECT/CT. SNs were resected using a combination of radio- and fluorescence guidance. Pathology was used to determine the primary tumour location and metastatic spread. Fluorescence imaging of paraffin-embedded prostate tissue was used to determine the location of the tracer deposits in the prostate. This deposition was related to the primary tumour location, the lymphatic drainage pattern of the injected tracer, and the metastatic spread.  Results:   In total 265 radioactive LNs (211 SNs and 54 higher-echelon nodes in 64 patients; 4.3 LNs per patient; IQR: 2-6) were identified. In three patients (4%) preoperative imaging did not allow identification of SNs. Tumour-positive SN visualization within the pelvis was shown to be influenced by intraprostatic location of tracer administration. This could be concluded from (1) a clear correlation between lymphatic drainage to the right or left side of the body and tracer deposition on the right or left side of the prostate, (2) visualization of a higher number of LNs after dorsal tracer deposition compared with ventral tracer deposition, (3) different drainage patterns observed for tracer deposition into the base or apex of the prostate, and (4) the indication that intratumoural tracer deposition increases the chance of visualizing nodal metastases compared with extratumoural tracer deposition.  Conclusions:   The correlation between the location of the tracer deposits, the location of the primary tumour, and the visualization of the (tumour-positive) SNs indicated that placement of tracer deposits is of influence on the visualized lymphatic drainage pattern. This suggests that tracer injection near or into the primary tumour site is beneficial for the identification of metastatic spread.""","""['C M de Korne', 'E M Wit', 'J de Jong', 'R A Valdés Olmos', 'T Buckle', 'F W B van Leeuwen', 'H G van der Poel']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Eur J Nucl Med Mol Imaging""","""['Relationship between intraprostatic tracer deposits and sentinel lymph node mapping in prostate cancer patients.', 'Multimodal hybrid imaging agents for sentinel node mapping as a means to (re)connect nuclear medicine to advances made in robot-assisted surgery.', 'Multispectral Fluorescence Imaging During Robot-assisted Laparoscopic Sentinel Node Biopsy: A First Step Towards a Fluorescence-based Anatomic Roadmap.', 'Sentinel node approach in prostate cancer.', 'Current perspectives of sentinel lymph node dissection at the time of radical surgery for prostate cancer.', 'Exploring the Applications of Indocyanine Green in Robot-Assisted Urological Surgery: A Comprehensive Review of Fluorescence-Guided Techniques.', 'Sentinel Lymph Node Techniques in Urologic Oncology: Current Knowledge and Application.', 'Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy in Prostate Cancer Patients: Results From an Injection Technique Targeting the Index Lesion in the Prostate Gland.', 'Anatomical Fundamentals and Current Surgical Knowledge of Prostate Anatomy Related to Functional and Oncological Outcomes for Robotic-Assisted Radical Prostatectomy.']"""

No standard local treatment exists for patients with an intraprostatic recurrence after radiotherapy. Stereotatic body radiotherapy (SBRT) could be a curative treatment for local recurrence. The phase I/II primary objective is the selection of the recommended dose for salvage-SBRT and to estimate the efficacy.  Methods and analysis:   We plan to perform a multicentre prospective phase I/II study including at least 47 patients. Eligible patients are patients with biochemical recurrence occurring at least 2 years after external radiotherapy for prostatic adenocarcinoma by the Phoenix definition (prostate-specific antigen (PSA) nadir +2 ng/mL) and histologically proven intraprostatic recurrence only (stage T1-T2 on relapse, PSA level ≤10 ng/mL, PSA doubling time >10 months, absence of pelvic or metastatic recurrence proven by choline or PSMA positron emission tomography scan, and pelvic and prostatic assessment by multiparametric MRI). The phase I primary objective is the selection of the recommended dose for salvage-SBRT (5×6, 6×6 or 5×5 Gy) based on dose-limiting toxicity (DLT). The dose of salvage-SBRT will be selected using a time-to-event continual reassessment method based on DLT defined as grade ≥3 gastrointestinal or urinary toxicity or any other grade 4 adverse event. The phase II primary outcome is to estimate the efficacy of the salvage-SBRT in terms of biochemical relapse-free survival rate (Phoenix definition: increase in serum total PSA ≥2 ng/mL above the nadir). Phase II secondary outcomes are acute and late toxicities, quality of life, clinical progression-free survival defined as the time interval between the date of registration and the date of clinical progression or death irrespective of the cause.  Ethics and dissemination:   The study has received ethical approval from the Ethics committee 'Ile-de-France III'. Academic dissemination will occur through publication and conference presentations.

Methods:   To confirm these data, we analyzed differences in NK cells from 94 men undergoing prostate biopsy to determine whether NK cells could predict for a positive biopsy. NK cells activity (NKA) was measured by an in vitro diagnostic system, with a pre-defined cut-off value for NKA at 200 pg/mL. Logistic regression and receiver operator characteristics (Area Under the Curve (AUC)) analyses were used to test the diagnostic value of NKA.  Results:   The NKA test performance showed specificity of 88%, positive predictive value of 84%, sensitivity of 34%, and a negative predictive value of 41%. Among the 94 men analyzed, NKA was not significantly linked with age, race, digital rectal examination (DRE), prostate volume, PSA or biopsy grade group (all P ≥ 0.14). In multivariable logistic regression analysis, the odds ratio (OR) of low NKA (<200 pg/mL) for the detection of PC was 4.89, 95%CI 1.34-17.8, with a ROC area under the curve of 0.79 in all participants and increasing to 0.83 and 0.85 for the detection of PC and high-grade PC, respectively, among men with a normal DRE.  Conclusions:   Men with a low NKA value had five-times higher odds of PC at biopsy. The implementation of this NKA assay in the clinic together with PSA may help to advise patients with the highest risk of PC whether, or not, to undergo a prostate biopsy.""","""['Adriana C Vidal', 'Lauren E Howard', 'Emily Wiggins', 'Amanda M De Hoedt', 'Stephen L Shiao', 'Simon Knott', 'Emanuela Taioli', 'Jay H Fowke', 'Stephen J Freedland']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Cancer Epidemiol""","""['Can natural killer cell activity help screen patients requiring a biopsy for the diagnosis of prostate cancer?', 'Association between natural killer cell activity and prostate cancer: a pilot study.', 'A nomogram for prediction of prostate cancer on multi-core biopsy using age, serum prostate-specific antigen, prostate volume and digital rectal examination in Singapore.', 'Raising cut-off value of prostate specific antigen (PSA) for biopsy in symptomatic men in India to reduce unnecessary biopsy.', 'Diagnostic performance of malignant prostatic cells detection in blood for early detection of prostate cancer: comparison to prostatic biopsy.', 'Advances in landscape and related therapeutic targets of the prostate tumor microenvironment.', 'Natural killer cell activity as a biomarker for the diagnosis of lung cancer in high-risk patients.', 'Resolving the immune landscape of human prostate at a single-cell level in health and cancer.', 'Postoperative Natural Killer Cell Dysfunction: The Prime Suspect in the Case of Metastasis Following Curative Cancer Surgery.', 'Person-to-Person Cancer Transmission via Allogenic Blood Transfusion.']"""

However, molecular mechanisms underlying the progression of prostate cancer are still unclear. In the study, we investigated the effects of ubiquitin specific protease 17 (USP17) on prostate cancer growth. The results indicated that USP17 expression was markedly increased in prostate cancer tissues and cell lines. Repressing USP17 expression significantly reduced the proliferation, migration and invasion of prostate cancer cells using cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8), colony formation and transwell assays. In addition, apoptosis was significantly induced by USP17 knockdown via increasing the expression of cleaved Caspase-9/-3 and poly (ADP)-ribose polymerase (PARP), as well as Cyto-c. Further, USP17 silence evidently promoted reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in prostate cancer cells. Nuclear nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB)/p65 expression and total NF-κB/p65 phosphorylation were markedly down-regulated by USP17 repression. Intriguingly, blocking ROS generation using its scavenger of N-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC) significantly abrogated USP17 knockdown-induced apoptosis and -inhibited NF-κB/p65 signaling in vitro. Our data also showed that USP17 silence impaired tumor growth in the subcutaneous mouse model in vivo. Taken together, our results suggested that USP17 decrease might exert anti-tumor activities against prostate cancer growth by inducing apoptosis and suppressing NF-κB/p65 signaling via the promotion of ROS. Thus, USP17 could be served as a promising candidate to develop effective therapeutic strategy against prostate cancer progression.""","""['Xu Baohai', 'Fu Shi', 'Feng Yongqi']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Biomed Pharmacother""","""['AURKA contributes to the progression of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) through modulating epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and apoptosis via the regulation of ROS.', 'SUMO-Specific Cysteine Protease 1 Promotes Epithelial Mesenchymal Transition of Prostate Cancer Cells via Regulating SMAD4 deSUMOylation.', 'Depletion of end-binding protein 1 (EB1) promotes apoptosis of human non-small-cell lung cancer cells via reactive oxygen species and Bax-mediated mitochondrial dysfunction.', 'USP17-mediated de-ubiquitination and cancer: Clients cluster around the cell cycle.', 'Dual Role of Reactive Oxygen Species and their Application in Cancer Therapy.', 'C4orf19 inhibits colorectal cancer cell proliferation by competitively binding to Keap1 with TRIM25 via the USP17/Elk-1/CDK6 axis.', 'Ubiquitin specific peptidases and prostate cancer.', 'The role of the deubiquitinating enzyme DUB3/USP17 in cancer: a narrative review.']"""

Method and materials:   Fifty-eight subjects who underwent CE-TRUS and subsequent radical prostatectomy with whole-mount pathology were included in the study. Each patient underwent evaluation with baseline TRUS and again during CE-TRUS with intravenous infusion of perflutren lipid microsphere (Definity, Lantheus Medical Imaging, N Billerica, MA). A subjective 5 point scale was used to rate each sextant of the prostate in 3 baseline imaging modes and in 5 contrast-enhanced imaging modes. Baseline TRUS and CE-TRUS findings were compared with digitized whole-mount findings. A clustered logistic regression model was computed to compare the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (Az) for detection of prostate cancer by various modes of ultrasound imaging.  Results:   Among the 58 whole-mount specimens, a maximum Gleason score of 6 was identified in 29 subjects, a score of 7 was identified in 24 and a score of 8 was identified in 5. The Az for baseline TRUS parameters was 0.55 for grayscale, 0.61 for color Doppler and 0.59 for power Doppler. CE-TRUS parameters demonstrated significant increases in Az with the highest Az for CE-power Doppler (0.66) and flash replenishment imaging (0.64) (P = .04 for comparison to baseline). The combination of CE-power Doppler and flash replenishment imaging resulted in improved Az compared with baseline imaging (0.70 vs 0.59, P= .006).

Oncological outcomes have been limited to biochemical failure after radical prostatectomy. Questions remain regarding the more definitive measures of outcomes and their relationship with caseload.  Methods:   The National Cancer Database was used to investigate the outcomes of radical prostatectomy in the United States. With overall survival (OS) as the primary outcome, the relationship between the facility annual caseload (FAC) for all prostate cancer encounters and the facility annual surgical caseload (FASC) for those requiring radical prostatectomy was examined with a Cox proportional hazards model. Four volume groups were defined by caseload: <50th percentile (volume group 1 [VG1]), 50th to 74th percentiles (volume group 2 [VG2]), 75th to 89th percentiles (volume group 3 [VG3]), and ≥90th percentile (volume group 4 [VG4]). By FAC/FASC, 11%/8%, 17%/18%, 25%/26%, and 47%/49% of patients were treated in VG1 through VG4, respectively.  Results:   Between 2004 and 2014, 488,389 patients underwent radical prostatectomy. At a median follow-up of 60.75 months, the median OS was not reached. There was a significant OS benefit as the caseload increased. For FAC, the adjusted OS difference between VG1 and VG4 at 90th percentile survivorship reached 13.2 months (hazard ratio [HR], 1.30; 95% CI, 1.23-1.36; P < .0001). For FASC, this was 11.3 months (HR, 1.25; 95% CI, 1.192-1.321; P < .0001).  Conclusions:   There is a statistically significant OS advantage from performing radical prostatectomy at a facility with a high annual caseload. Caseload measured by all prostate cancer encounters is a better predictor of favorable outcomes than the number of surgeries performed at a facility.

Summary answer:   Although human testicular PDGFRα+ cells are multipotent and are capable of differentiating into steroidogenic cells with Leydig cell characteristics, they are not able to produce testosterone after differentiation.  What is known already:   In rodents, stem Leydig cells (SLCs) that have been identified and isolated using the marker PDGFRα can give rise to adult testosterone-producing Leydig cells after appropriate differentiation in vitro. Although PDGFRα+ cells have also been identified in human testicular tissue, so far there is no evidence that these cells are true human SLCs that can differentiate into functional Leydig cells in vitro or in vivo.  Study design, size, duration:   We isolated testicular cells enriched for interstitial cells from frozen-thawed fragments of testicular tissue from four human donors. Depending on the obtained cell number, PDGFRα+-sorted cells of three to four donors were exposed to differentiation conditions in vitro to stimulate development into adipocytes, osteocytes, chondrocytes or into Leydig cells. We compared their cell characteristics with cells directly after sorting and cells in propagation conditions. To investigate their differentiation potential in vivo, PDGFRα+-sorted cells were transplanted in the testis of 12 luteinizing hormone receptor-knockout (LuRKO) mice of which 6 mice received immunosuppression treatment. An additional six mice did not receive cell transplantation and were used as a control.  Participants/materials, setting, methods:   Human testicular interstitial cells were cultured to Passage 3 and FACS sorted for HLA-A,B,C+/CD34-/PDGFRα+. We examined their mesenchymal stromal cell (MSC) membrane protein expression by FACS analyses. Furthermore, we investigated lineage-specific staining and gene expression after MSC trilineage differentiation. For the differentiation into Leydig cells, PDGFRα+-sorted cells were cultured in either proliferation or differentiation medium for 28 days, after which they were stimulated either with or without hCG, forskolin or dbcAMP for 24 h to examine the increase in gene expression of steroidogenic enzymes using qPCR. In addition, testosterone, androstenedione and progesterone levels were measured in the culture medium. We also transplanted human PDGFRα+-sorted testicular interstitial cells into the testis of LuRKO mice. Serum was collected at several time points after transplantation, and testosterone was measured. Twenty weeks after transplantation testes were collected for histological examination.  Main results and the role of chance:   From primary cultured human testicular interstitial cells at Passage 3, we could obtain a population of HLA-A,B,C+/CD34-/PDGFRα+ cells by FACS. The sorted cells showed characteristics of MSC and were able to differentiate into adipocytes, chondrocytes and osteocytes. Upon directed differentiation into Leydig cells in vitro, we observed a significant increase in the expression of HSD3B2 and INSL3. After 24 h stimulation with forskolin or dbcAMP, a significantly increased expression of STAR and CYP11A1 was observed. The cells already expressed HSD17B3 and CYP17A1 before differentiation but the expression of these genes were not significantly increased after differentiation and stimulation. Testosterone levels could not be detected in the medium in any of the stimulation conditions, but after stimulation with forskolin or dbcAMP, androstenedione and progesterone were detected in culture medium. After transplantation of the human cells into the testes of LuRKO mice, no significant increase in serum testosterone levels was found compared to the controls. Also, no human cells were identified in the interstitium of mice testes 20 weeks after transplantation.  Large scale data:   N/A.  Limitations, reasons for caution:   This study was performed using tissue from only four donors because of limitations in donor material. Because of the need of sufficient cell numbers, we first propagated cells to passage 3 before FACS of the desired cell population was performed. We cannot rule out this propagation of the cells resulted in loss of stem cell properties.  Wider implications of the findings:   A lot of information on Leydig cell development is obtained from rodent studies, while the knowledge on human Leydig cell development is very limited. Our study shows that human testicular interstitial PDGFRα+ cells have different characteristics compared to rodent testicular PDGFRα+ cells in gene expression levels of steroidogenic enzymes and potential to differentiate in adult Leydig cells under comparable culture conditions. This emphasizes the need for confirming results from rodent studies in the human situation to be able to translate this knowledge to the human conditions, to eventually contribute to improvements of testosterone replacement therapies or establishing alternative cell therapies in the future, potentially based on SLCs.

We aimed to obtain estimates of the causal association of BMI with all-cause and cause-specific mortality.  Methods and findings:   In a record-linked, intergenerational prospective study from the general population of Sweden, we used two-sample instrumental variable (IV) analysis with data from 996,898 fathers (282,407 deaths) and 1,013,083 mothers (153,043 deaths) and their sons followed up from January 1, 1961, until December 31, 2004. Sons' BMI was used as the instrument for parents' BMI to compute hazard ratios (HRs) for risk of mortality per standard deviation (SD) higher parents' BMI. Using offspring exposure as an instrument for parents' exposure is unlikely to be affected by reverse causality (an important source of bias in this context) and reduces confounding. IV analyses supported causal associations between higher BMI and greater risk of all-cause mortality (HR [95% confidence interval (CI)] per SD higher fathers' BMI: 1.29 [1.26-1.31] and mothers' BMI: 1.39 [1.35-1.42]) and overall cancer mortality (HR per SD higher fathers' BMI: 1.20 [1.16-1.24] and mothers' BMI: 1.29 [1.24-1.34]), including 9 site-specific cancers in men (bladder, colorectum, gallbladder, kidney, liver, lung, lymphatic system, pancreas, and stomach) and 11 site-specific cancers in women (gallbladder, kidney, liver, lung, lymphatic system, ovaries, pancreas, stomach, uterus, cervix, and endometrium). There was evidence supporting causal associations between higher BMI in mothers and greater risk of mortality from kidney disease (HR: 2.17 [1.68-2.81]) and lower risk of mortality from suicide (HR: 0.77 [0.65-0.90]). In both sexes, there was evidence supporting causal associations between higher BMI and mortality from cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), stroke, diabetes, and respiratory diseases. We were unable to test the association between sons' and mothers' BMIs (as mothers' data were unavailable) or whether the instrument was independent of unmeasured or residual confounding; however, the associations between parents' mortality and sons' BMI were negligibly influenced by adjustment for available confounders.  Conclusions:   Consistent with previous large-scale meta-analyses and reviews, results supported the causal role of higher BMI in increasing the risk of several common causes of death, including cancers with increasing global incidence. We also found positive effects of BMI on mortality from respiratory disease, prostate cancer, and lung cancer, which has been inconsistently reported in the literature, suggesting that the causal role of higher BMI in mortality from these diseases may be underestimated. Furthermore, we expect different patterns of bias in the current observational and IV analyses; therefore, the similarities between our findings from both methods increases confidence in the results. These findings support efforts to understand the mechanisms underpinning these effects to inform targeted interventions and develop population-based strategies to reduce rising obesity levels for disease prevention.""","""['Kaitlin H Wade', 'David Carslake', 'Per Tynelius', 'George Davey Smith', 'Richard M Martin']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""PLoS Med""","""['The association between BMI and mortality using offspring BMI as an indicator of own BMI: large intergenerational mortality study.', 'Estimating the influence of body mass index (BMI) on mortality using offspring BMI as an instrumental variable.', 'Association of Body Mass Index with Depression, Anxiety and Suicide-An Instrumental Variable Analysis of the HUNT Study.', 'Offspring birth weight and parental mortality: prospective observational study and meta-analysis.', 'The relationship of vitamin D status to risk of cardiovascular disease and mortality.', 'Physical activity, obesity, and bladder cancer incidence.', 'Mothers of small-bodied children and fathers of vigorous sons live longer.', 'Familial aggregation of the aging process: biological age measured in young adult offspring as a predictor of parental mortality.', 'Comparison of intergenerational instrumental variable analyses of body mass index and mortality in UK Biobank.', 'Mortality Among Danish Patients with a Hospital Diagnosis of Overweight or Obesity Over a 40-Year Period.']"""

Materials/methods:   Nineteen patients with B/P-RMS were enrolled on a prospective registry protocol (2008-2017) and treated with chemotherapy, proton beam therapy (PBT), and surgical resection (n = 8; 42%). Emphasis was given to treatment technique, disease-related outcomes, and toxicity associated with PBT.  Results:   The majority of patients had bladder RMS (74%) of embryonal histology (95%), Group III (68%), and intermediate-risk disease by Children's Oncology Group (COG) risk stratification (89%). Seven patients (37%) had primary tumors >5 cm in size. All patients were treated according to COG protocols. With a median follow-up of 66.2 months, 5-year overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were 76%. Four patients (21%) experienced disease relapse, all presenting with local failure. The 5-year local control (LC) rate was 76%. Tumor size predicted LC, with 5-year LC for patients with >5 cm tumors being 43% versus 100% for those with ≤5 cm tumors (P = .006). Univariate analysis demonstrated an effect of tumor size on OS (tumor >5 cm, hazard ratio [HR] 17.7, P = .049) and PFS (HR 17.7, P = .049).

Methods:   We conducted a population-based cohort study using data from the Urban Employee Basic Medical Insurance database (2011-2014) in Beijing. We identified 475 patients with newly diagnosed bone metastatic prostate cancer with at least one prescription for hormone therapy and described their treatment patterns over a median follow-up of 20.7 months. Cox proportional hazards model was used to compare time to chemotherapy initiation between patients starting on different hormone therapies.  Results:   Hormone therapy and/or bisphosphonate therapy with zoledronic acid were the initial treatments in the majority of patients (87.8%); chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and surgery were usually given later in the treatment pathway. CAB was the most common hormone treatment (73.7%).

However, the upstream signaling mechanism triggered by YM155 remains unclear. Here we studied early signaling responses in vitro in prostate and renal cancer cell lines in a dose-dependent manner. We found that YM155 rapidly activates the retinoblastoma protein, correlating with the loss of expression of all three Cyclin Ds.

Moreover, we provide the first evidence that YM155 changes the phosphorylation status of known mTOR-target proteins involved in translational control, namely ribosomal protein S6 (rS6) and 4E-BP1. Our data support that YM155 achieves this by blocking mTORC1 via the phosphorylation of Raptor at S792 through activated AMPKα (T172). Furthermore, we also used a polysome profile, supporting that YM155 markedly suppresses cap-dependent translation of mRNAs which include Survivin, Cyclin D1 and Mcl-1.

Therefore, the current study was designed to investigate the effect of LLM on fatty acid synthesis. Exposure of 22Rv1, LNCaP, and PC-3 prostate cancer cells, but not RWPE-1 normal prostate epithelial cell line, to LLM resulted in a decrease in intracellular levels of neutral lipids or total free fatty acids. LLM was superior to another fatty acid synthesis inhibitor (cerulenin) for suppression of total free fatty acid levels. LLM treatment downregulated protein and/or mRNA expression of key fatty acid synthesis enzymes, including ATP citrate lyase, acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1, fatty acid synthase, and sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP1) in each cell line. Consistent with these in vitro findings, we also observed a significant decrease in ATP citrate lyase and SREBP1 protein expression as well as number of neutral lipid droplets in vivo in 22Rv1 tumor sections of LLM-treated mice when compared with that of controls. LLM-mediated suppression of intracellular levels of total free fatty acids and neutral lipids was partly attenuated by overexpression of SREBP1.

Neuroendocrine transdifferentiation (NEtD), an putative initial step in t-NEPC development, is induced by androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT) or anti-androgens, and by activation of the β2-adrenergic receptor (ADRB2) in prostate cancer cell lines. Thus, understanding whether ADRB2 is involved in ADT-initiated NEtD may assist in developing treatment strategies that can prevent or reverse t-NEPC emergence, thereby prolonging therapeutic responses. Here we found that in primary, treatment-naïve prostate cancers, ADRB2 mRNA was positively correlated with expression of luminal differentiation markers, and ADRB2 protein levels were inversely correlated with Gleason grade. ADRB2 mRNA was upregulated in metastatic prostate cancer, and progressively downregulated during ADT and t-NEPC emergence. In androgen-deprivated medium, high ADRB2 was required for LNCaP cells to undergo NEtD, measured as increased neurite outgrowth and expression of neuron differentiation and neuroendocrine genes. ADRB2 overexpression induced a neuroendocrine-like morphology in both androgen receptor (AR)-positive and -negative prostate cancer cell lines. ADRB2 downregulation in LNCaP cells increased canonical Wnt signaling, and GSK3α/β inhibition reduced the expression of neuron differentiation and neuroendocrine genes. In LNCaP xenografts, more pronounced castration-induced NEtD was observed in tumors derived from high than low ADRB2 cells. In conclusion, high ADRB2 expression is required for ADT-induced NEtD, characterized by ADRB2 downregulation and t-NEPC emergence.

Given the known role of serum protein binding in drug bioavailability and the distribution via blood plasma, this study assessed the interaction of RuNTF with human serum albumin (HSA) by circular dichroism (CD) and fluorescence spectroscopy.

In South Africa, where cancer detection, intervention, and care are available for many citizens, cancer is poorly detected and understood among politically and economically marginalized communities in rural and urban centers. These trends are reflected in a history of systematic marginalization of such contexts from public resources, including education and health care, stemming from racism and wealth inequity. This article investigates how Black South Africans residing in Soweto, a township of Johannesburg, perceive and experience breast and prostate cancers amidst multiple, concurrent medical conditions. We used convenience sampling to recruit 80 study participants already enrolled in longitudinal studies of breast and prostate cancers at a tertiary hospital in Soweto between June and August 2017. This included 50 women diagnosed with breast cancer and 30 men diagnosed with prostate cancer; three-quarters of the sample had two or more comorbidities, including HIV, hypertension, diabetes, anxiety, and others. Many described sickness in terms of any physical ill-health that affected daily routines, but rarely was it associated exclusively with a specific disease. Men and women described more fear associated with cancer than HIV or hypertension-two of the most common diseases. We found that this may be in part a reflection of how people feared and demonized their cancer diagnoses, calling it ""a demon!"", and framing cancer through the trauma of aggressive treatments like chemotherapy (""the red devil!"") and physical disfiguration from mastectomy. In contrast, men's prostate cancer treatments were often hormonal therapy and men associated cancer to a normal side effect of aging. Intervening in how people think about cancer may improve how people live well with the condition amidst other cascading social and health problems they face.""","""['Emily Mendenhall', 'Edna N Bosire', 'Andrew Wooyoung Kim', 'Shane A Norris']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Soc Sci Med""","""['Health system experiences of breast cancer survivors in urban South Africa.', 'When HIV is ordinary and diabetes new: remaking suffering in a South African township.', 'Prevalence of multimorbidity in men of African descent with and without prostate cancer in Soweto, South Africa.', 'Breast Cancer and HIV: a South African perspective and a critical review of the literature.', 'Breast Cancer and HIV in Sub-Saharan Africa: A Complex Relationship.', 'A mixed-methods, population-based study of a syndemic in Soweto, South Africa.', 'Experience of chronic noncommunicable disease in people living with HIV: a systematic review and meta-aggregation of qualitative studies.', 'Health system experiences of breast cancer survivors in urban South Africa.']"""

Evidence-based health information could help individuals make informed decisions about whether to undergo PSA testing or not. This evaluation aimed to determine whether the written health information materials available in Germany provide appropriate information for informed decision-making on PSA based screening.  Methods:   A list of criteria was developed and used to systematically assess the quality of information on the benefits and harms of prostate cancer screening included in written health information materials. Fourteen information materials identified by information requests and online searches were evaluated independently by two of three reviewers. Consensus was achieved with a third reviewer.  Results:   Of the 14 information materials evaluated, 10 (71%) list the ability to reduce the absolute risk of death from prostate cancer as a benefit of PSA testing, 9 (64%) point out the risks of follow-up diagnostics, 13 (93%) describe the risks of the available prostate cancer treatments, and all 14 specify the risk of overdiagnosis. The minority provide numerical data on benefits and risks. Partially mismatched framing was identified in four cases: two information materials report only the relative frequencies of benefits, and two report only the absolute frequencies of harms. Half of the materials encouraged participation using downplaying or frightening language.

Unfortunately, the means to discriminate between patients with indolent disease and those who progress to aggressive prostate cancer is currently unavailable, resulting in over-treatment of patients. We therefore aimed to determine biomarkers of prostate cancer that can be used in the clinic to aid the diagnosis and prognosis. Immunohistochemistry analysis was carried out on prostate cancer specimens with a range of Gleason scores. Samples were stained and analysed for intensity of the Seven Transmembrane Epithelial Antigen of the Prostate (STEAP)-1, -2, -3, -4 and the Divalent Metal Transporter 1 (DMT1) proteins to determine suitable biomarkers for classification of patients likely to develop aggressive prostate cancer. Additionally, these proteins were also analysed to determine whether any would be able to predict future relapse using Kaplan Meier analysis. Data generated demonstrated that the protein expression levels of STEAP2 correlated significantly with Gleason score; furthermore, STEAP4 was a significant predictor of relapse. This data indicates that STEAP2 could be potential prognostic candidate for use in combination with the current prostate cancer detection methods and the presence of STEAP4 could be an indicator of possible relapse.""","""['Stephanie E A Burnell', 'Samantha Spencer-Harty', 'Suzie Howarth', 'Owen Bodger', 'Howard Kynaston', 'Claire Morgan', 'Shareen H Doak']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['STEAP1 is overexpressed in prostate cancer and prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia lesions, and it is positively associated with Gleason score.', 'STEAP1 protein overexpression is an independent marker for biochemical recurrence in prostate carcinoma.', 'Putative prognostic epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition biomarkers for aggressive prostate cancer.', 'STEAP proteins: from structure to applications in cancer therapy.', 'The Usefulness of STEAP Proteins in Prostate Cancer Clinical Practice.', 'Relevant Membrane Transport Proteins as Possible Gatekeepers for Effective Pharmacological Ascorbate Treatment in Cancer.', 'Six-Transmembrane Epithelial Antigen of Prostate 4: An Indicator of Prognosis and Tumor Immunity in Hepatocellular Carcinoma.', 'Bispecific T-Cell Engagers Therapies in Solid Tumors: Focusing on Prostate Cancer.', 'STEAP1-4 (Six-Transmembrane Epithelial Antigen of the Prostate 1-4) and Their Clinical Implications for Prostate Cancer.', 'The Role of Iron in Cancer Progression.']"""

Materials and methods:   We queried the NHANES (National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey) from 1999 to 2000, 2003 to 2004 and 2011 to 2012. Men 18 to 80 years old who completed the 2-day dietary history and underwent serum testosterone testing were included in analysis. Diets were categorized as low fat, Mediterranean, low carbohydrate or nonrestrictive. Multivariable modeling was used to determine the relationship between diet and serum testosterone.  Results:   Of the 3,128 men who met study inclusion criteria 457 (14.6%) and 764 (24.4%) met the criteria for a low fat and a Mediterranean diet, respectively. Only 2 men (less than 0.1%) met the criteria for a low carbohydrate diet, which was removed from further analysis. Mean ± SD serum testosterone was 435.5 ± 6.7 ng/dl. Mean testosterone was lower among men with a low fat diet (410.8 ± 8.1 vs 443.5 ± 7.3, p=0.005) and a Mediterranean diet (412.9 ± 9.1 vs 443.5 ± 7.3, p=0.002). Multivariable analysis controlling for age, body mass index, activity level, diabetes, comorbidities and prostate cancer showed that men with a nonrestrictive diet had higher serum testosterone than those adhering to a low fat diet (ß -57.2, 95% CI -105.6 to -8.8, p <0.05).  Conclusions:   Men adhering to low fat diets had lower serum testosterone levels even when controlling for comorbidities, age, body mass index and activity levels.

Patients and methods:   In all, 248 patients treated with radical prostatectomy and ePLND or PLND were included. ML-assisted models were developed from 18 integrated features using logistic regression (LR), support vector machine (SVM), and random forests (RFs). The models were compared to the Memorial SloanKettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) nomogram using receiver operating characteristic-derived area under the curve (AUC) calibration plots and decision curve analysis (DCA).  Results:   A total of 59/248 (23.8%) lymph node invasions (LNIs) were identified at surgery. The predictive accuracy of the ML-based models, with (+) or without (-) MRI-reported LNI, yielded similar AUCs (RFs+ /RFs- : 0.906/0.885; SVM+ /SVM- : 0.891/0.868; LR+ /LR- : 0.886/0.882) and were higher than the MSKCC nomogram (0.816; P < 0.001). The calibration of the MSKCC nomogram tended to underestimate LNI risk across the entire range of predicted probabilities compared to the ML-assisted models. The DCA showed that the ML-assisted models significantly improved risk prediction at a risk threshold of ≤80% compared to the MSKCC nomogram.

Materials and methods:   Lymphocytes isolated from normal donor blood were set up in co-cultures with either cancer or non-cancerous prostate cell lines, together with each of the cytokines interleukin (IL)-2, IL-12, IL-15, interferon (IFN)-γ or IL-21 for a period of 7 days. Then, expansion of NK cells, NKT cells and CD8 T cells was measured by flow cytometry and compared with the expansion of the same cells in the absence of prostate cells. The cytotoxic activity of NK cells, as measured by perforin and tumour cell killing, was also assessed. NK cell receptors and their corresponding ligands on prostate tumour cells were analysed to determine whether any of these were modulated by co-culture. The role of the tumour-secreted heat shock proteins HSP90 and HSP70 in the expansion of NK cells in the co-cultures was also investigated because of their effects on NK and CD8 T-cell activation.  Results:   We showed that, among a panel of cytokines known to cause NK cell activation and expansion, only IL-15 could actively induce expansion of NK, NKT and CD8 T cells in the presence of prostate cancer cell lines. Furthermore, the expansion of NK cells was far greater (up to 50% greater) in the presence of the cancer cells (LNCaP, PC3) than when lymphocytes were incubated alone. In contrast, non-cancerous cell lines (PNT2 and WPMY-1) did not exert any expansion of NK cells. The cytolytic activity of the NK cells, as measured by perforin, CD107a and killing of tumour cells, was also greatest in co-cultures with IL-15. Examination of NK cell receptors shows that NKG2D is upregulated to a greater degree in the presence of prostate cancer cells, compared with the upregulation with IL-15 in lymphocytes alone. However, blocking of NKG2D does not inhibit the enhanced expansion of NK cells in the presence of tumour cells.  Conclusions:   Among a panel of NK cell-activating cytokines, IL-15 was the only cytokine that could stimulate expansion of NK cells in the presence of prostate cancer cells; therefore IL-15 may be a good candidate for novel future intra-tumoural therapy of the disease.""","""['Christina Sakellariou', 'Oussama Elhage', 'Efthymia Papaevangelou', 'Giulio Giustarini', 'Ana M Esteves', 'Dorota Smolarek', 'Richard A Smith', 'Prokar Dasgupta', 'Christine Galustian']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""BJU Int""","""['Erratum.', 'IL-15R alpha-IgG1-Fc enhances IL-2 and IL-15 anti-tumor action through NK and CD8+ T cells proliferation and activation.', 'IL-15 Upregulates Telomerase Expression and Potently Increases Proliferative Capacity of NK, NKT-Like, and CD8 T Cells.', 'Influence of In Vitro IL-2 or IL-15 Alone or in Combination with Hsp 70 Derived 14-Mer Peptide (TKD) on the Expression of NK Cell Activatory and Inhibitory Receptors on Peripheral Blood T Cells, B Cells and NKT Cells.', 'IL-27 enhances IL-15/IL-18-mediated activation of human natural killer cells.', 'Phenotype and Function of Activated Natural Killer Cells From Patients With Prostate Cancer: Patient-Dependent Responses to Priming and IL-2 Activation.', 'Chemokines and cytokines: Axis and allies in prostate cancer pathogenesis.', 'Cytotopic (Cyto-) IL-15 as a New Immunotherapy for Prostate Cancer: Recombinant Production in Escherichia coli and Purification.', 'The Role of Androgen Receptor in Cross Talk Between Stromal Cells and Prostate Cancer Epithelial Cells.', 'Angiogenesis and Anti-Angiogenic Treatment in Prostate Cancer: Mechanisms of Action and Molecular Targets.', 'Could Harnessing Natural Killer Cell Activity Be a Promising Therapy for Prostate Cancer?']"""

As limited data support the use of dipstick urinalysis, we have used data from three recently published studies to assess clinical outcomes in those who had dipstick urinalysis findings for blood, glucose, and/or leukocytes.  Methods:   We analyzed data from three observational studies involving men interested in using over-the-counter tamsulosin: a self-selection study (SSS) and two actual-use studies of 8-week (AUS8) and 24-week (AUS24) durations. Subgroup analyses focused on pooled data from participants not using α-blockers or other prescription medication for LUTS suggestive of BPH (nonRx users) and who had urine dipstick findings. Data from participants using α-blockers (AUS8) or any prescription BPH medications (SSS and AUS24) are presented as reference.  Results:   Overall, 2488 nonRx users underwent dipstick urinalysis and 680 (27.3%) had positive findings including traces of blood (332; 13.3%), glucose (259; 10.4%), and/or leukocytes (245; 9.8%). Among users of prescription medicines, 21.6% (37/171) in SSS, 27.4% (23/84) in AUS8, and 31.1% (47/151) in AUS24 had urine dipstick findings. The 200 dipstick-positive nonRx users in SSS underwent per protocol urological assessment: 26 (13.0%) had a newly diagnosed condition causing/contributing to urinary symptoms of which 2.9% were identified as medically important conditions. Among nonRx users with or without a dipstick finding, medically important conditions reported included prostate cancer (1.0% vs. 1.0%, respectively) and urolithiasis (1.0% vs. 0.3%, respectively). The proportion of men with dipstick urinalysis findings was similar between men who regularly visited their physician and those who did not.  Conclusion:   Dipstick urinalysis did not markedly increase the detection of undiagnosed medically important conditions that cause/contribute to urinary symptoms, suggesting that this test may not be a very effective screening tool for men with LUTS.

We observed high expression of GPC-1 in more aggressive prostate cancer cell lines such as PC-3 and DU-145. While inhibition of GPC-1 expression in PC-3 cells decreased cell growth and migration in vitro, it surprisingly increased cell proliferation and migration in DU-145 cells, suggesting that the role of GPC-1 is cell type-dependent. Further, GPC-1 inhibition increased PC-3 tumor size in NCr nude mice xenografts. We hypothesized that the discrepancy between the in vitro and in vivo data is mediated by stromal cells in the tumor microenvironment. Thus, we tested the effect of tumor conditioned media (TCM) on gene expression in human mesenchymal stem cells and fibroblasts.

This study sought to determine practice patterns and outcomes among these patients.  Patients and methods:   A total of 748,825 patients with prostate cancer from 2004 through 2012 were identified using the National Cancer Database. These patients were subdivided by PSA level (0-9.9, 10.0-19.9, 20.0-39.9, 40.0-59.9, 60.0-79.9, 80.0-97.9, and ≥98.0 ng/mL), nodal status (N0 vs N1), and distant metastases (M0 vs M1). Rates of locoregional treatment and 5-year overall survival (OS) in each group were determined. Survival was compared using Cox regression after adjusting for multiple patient-specific factors.  Results:   The rate of locoregional treatment for patients with N0M0 disease and PSA level ≥98.0 ng/mL was significantly lower than for those with N1M0 disease (52.6% vs 60.4%; P<.001) or N0M0 disease and PSA level <98.0 ng/mL (52.6% vs 86.6%; P<.001). The 5-year OS rate was similar for patients with N1M0 disease and those with N0M0 disease and a very high PSA level (63.2% vs 59.1%; adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 0.91; P=.063). The survival benefit associated with locoregional treatment was higher among those with N0M0 disease and a very high PSA level than among those with N1M0 disease (aHR, 0.28 vs 0.44; P<.001).  Conclusions:   Patients with clinical N0M0 disease and a very high PSA level (≥98.0 ng/mL) have outcomes similar to those with N1 disease but receive locoregional treatment at a lower rate.

Surprisingly, the effects of aging on prostate epithelial cells have not been established. Here we find that organoid-forming progenitor activity of mouse prostate basal and luminal cells is maintained with age. This is caused by an age-related expansion of progenitor-like luminal cells that share features with human prostate luminal progenitor cells. The increase in luminal progenitor cells may contribute to greater risk for growth-related disease in the aging prostate.

In this study, we aim to investigate the anti-proliferative effect and glycolysis regulation of DHA on prostate cancer cell LNCaP.  Main methods:   Cell proliferative activity and apoptosis inducing were detected. The gene expression was detected by mRNA microarray and results were analyzed by GO and KEGG pathway database. Expressions of glycolysis key enzymes and PI3K/AKT/HIF-1α were detected by Western blot.  Key findings:   Results indicated that DHA could inhibit the LNCaP cell proliferation considerably and induce cell apoptosis. mRNA microarray showed 1293 genes were upregulated and 2322 genes were downregulated. GO and KEGG enrichment analysis suggested that glycolysis pathway was correlated with DHA inhibited the proliferation on the LNCaP cell. Western blot results showed that DHA can decrease GLUT1 and regulatory enzymes of glycolytic pathway expression probably by suppressing the activity of the intracellular Akt/mTOR and HIF-1 α.

C-C chemokine receptor 4 (CCR4) is highly expressed on effector Tregs, and anti-CCR4 antibody is attracting attention as a novel immunotherapeutic agent for solid tumors. This study aimed to evaluate the expression of CCR4-positive Tregs (CCR4+Tregs) in prostate cancer and estimate the clinical potential of CCR4-targeting therapy for prostate cancer.  Methods:   A total of 15 radical prostatectomy (RP) specimens and 60 biopsy specimens from individuals diagnosed with prostate cancer were analyzed to evaluate the infiltration of CCR4+Tregs in prostate cancer. The relationships between the number of CCR4+Tregs and clinical parameters were investigated in RP and biopsy specimens. Moreover, the total number of Tregs, CCR4+Tregs, and T cells and the ratio of CCR4+Tregs to Tregs and T cells in biopsy specimens were compared between patients with poor prognosis who progressed to castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) within 12 months (n = 13) and those with good prognosis who were stable with hormone-sensitive prostate cancer over 12 months (n = 47). Furthermore, biopsy specimens were divided into two groups: low and high CCR4+Treg expression groups and the prognosis was compared between them.  Results:   There was a higher expression of CCR4+Tregs in RP specimens with a higher (≥8) Gleason score than in those with a lower (<8) Gleason score (P = .041). In biopsy specimens, 65.9% Tregs were positive for CCR4. The number of CCR4+Tregs positively correlated with clinical stage (P < .001) and Gleason score (P = .006). The total number of Tregs and CCR4+Tregs significantly increased in the poor prognosis group compared with that in the good prognosis group (P = .024 and .01, respectively). Furthermore, patients with lower CCR4+Treg expression levels showed a significantly longer time to progression to CRPC (not reached vs 27.3 months; P < .001) and median survival time (not reached vs 69.0 months; P = .014) than those with higher expression levels.

PSA might have a diurnal variation and the timing of measurement could change the clinical practice for prostate biopsy.  Methods:   Male patients complaining of lower urinary tract symptoms (group 1) and diagnosed with prostate cancer (group 2) were recruited into the study. Morning fasting blood samples were withdrawn between 9.00 and 11.00 am for the determination of biochemical parameters, PSA (PSA1), total testosterone (T1), and estradiol (E1) levels. In the afternoon, between 15.00 and 15.30 pm, blood samples were again obtained from the same participants at the same day and the serum concentration of PSA (PSA2), total testosterone (T2), and estradiol (E2) were measured.  Results:   A total of 160 and 30 patients were enrolled in groups 1 and 2, respectively. One hundred forty (87.5%) and 26 (86.6%) patients had a decrease in the PSA levels when measured in the afternoon. The Wilcoxon signed-rank test determined a statistically significant difference between the PSA levels measured in the morning and in the afternoon in each group. An analysis of covariance test revealed no statistically significant difference in PSA concentration between the groups after adjustment for baseline concentration (F(1.187) = 0.203, P = .653). There was a weak positive correlation between PSA1/PSA2 and T1/T2, rs (160) = 0.163, P = .034. An extra unit increase in PSA1 concentration leads to a 0.805 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.781-0.830) and 0.828 (95% CI, 0.807-0.849) ng/mL increase in PSA2 concentration in groups 1 and 2, respectively, that is, patients with and without prostate cancer had a similar decrease in the PSA levels. When measured in the afternoon, 66.6% and 50% patients with a morning PSA level over 3 or 4 ng/mL had a PSA drop below these levels, respectively.

Combining data from the National Cancer Institute, the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries, and the National Center for Health Statistics, the authors provide comprehensive information on cancer occurrence in adults aged 85 years and older. In 2019, there will be approximately 140,690 cancer cases diagnosed and 103,250 cancer deaths among the oldest old in the United States. The most common cancers in these individuals (lung, breast, prostate, and colorectum) are the same as those in the general population. Overall cancer incidence rates peaked in the oldest men and women around 1990 and have subsequently declined, with the pace accelerating during the past decade. These trends largely reflect declines in cancers of the prostate and colorectum and, more recently, cancers of the lung among men and the breast among women. We note differences in trends for some cancers in the oldest age group (eg, lung cancer and melanoma) compared with adults aged 65 to 84 years, which reflect elevated risks in the oldest generations. In addition, cancers in the oldest old are often more advanced at diagnosis. For example, breast and colorectal cancers diagnosed in patients aged 85 years and older are about 10% less likely to be diagnosed at a local stage compared with those diagnosed in patients aged 65 to 84 years. Patients with cancer who are aged 85 years and older have the lowest relative survival of any age group, with the largest disparities noted when cancer is diagnosed at advanced stages. They are also less likely to receive surgical treatment for their cancers; only 65% of breast cancer patients aged 85 years and older received surgery compared with 89% of those aged 65 to 84 years. This difference may reflect the complexities of treating older patients, including the presence of multiple comorbidities, functional declines, and cognitive impairment, as well as competing mortality risks and undertreatment. More research on cancer in the oldest Americans is needed to improve outcomes and anticipate the complex health care needs of this rapidly growing population.""","""['Carol E DeSantis', 'Kimberly D Miller', 'William Dale', 'Supriya G Mohile', 'Harvey J Cohen', 'Corinne R Leach', 'Ann Goding Sauer', 'Ahmedin Jemal', 'Rebecca L Siegel']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""CA Cancer J Clin""","""['Trends in breast cancer by race and ethnicity: update 2006.', 'Cancer statistics, 2020.', 'Cancers Among the Oldest Old in Massachusetts from 2004-2014.', 'Cancers with increasing incidence trends in the United States: 1999 through 2008.', 'Breast cancer statistics, 2013.', 'DBF4 Dependent Kinase Inhibition Suppresses Hepatocellular Carcinoma Progression and Potentiates Anti-Programmed Cell Death-1 Therapy.', 'Frailty and medical financial hardship among older adults with cancer in the United States.', 'Predictors of cognitive impairment in patients undergoing ileostomy for colorectal cancer: a retrospective analysis.', 'Nutrition as prevention for improved cancer health outcomes: a systematic literature review.', 'Exploring the Burden of Cancer in Pakistan: An Analysis of 2019 Data.']"""

The objective of the current study was to identify predictors of SREs and all-cause mortality among men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC).  Methods:   Data were collected on 837 men with bone mCRPC at 8 Veterans Affairs medical centers within the Shared Equal Access Regional Cancer Hospital (SEARCH) database from 2000 through 2017. Patients were followed to assess development of SREs (pathological fracture, radiotherapy to bone, spinal cord compression, or surgery to bone). Cox proportional hazards models were used to evaluate predictors of SREs and mortality.  Results:   Of the 837 men with bone mCRPC, 287 developed a SRE and 740 men died (median follow-up, 26 months). Bone pain was found to be the strongest predictor of SREs (hazard ratio [HR], 2.96; 95% CI, 2.25-3.89).

Ten or more bone metastases (HR, 2.17; 95% CI, 1.72-2.74), undergoing radical prostatectomy (HR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.61-0.89), shorter progression to CRPC (HR, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.94-0.99), older age (HR, 1.03; 95% CI, 1.02-1.04), higher prostate-specific antigen level at the time of diagnosis of metastasis (HR, 1.21; 95% CI, 1.14-1.28), bone pain (HR, 1.44; 95% CI, 1.23-1.70), and visceral metastasis (HR, 1.72; 95% CI, 1.23-2.39) were associated with an increased mortality risk.

Tissue biopsy is an invasive procedure associated with significant morbidity. More accurate noninvasive or minimally invasive diagnostic approaches should be developed to avoid unnecessary prostate biopsy and over diagnosis. We investigated the potential of using circulating tumor cell analysis in cancer diagnosis, particularly to predict clinically significant prostate cancer in prebiopsy cases.  Materials and methods:   We enrolled 155 treatment naïve patients with prostate cancer and 98 before biopsy for circulating tumor cell enumeration. RNA was extracted from circulating tumor cells of 184 patients for gene expression analysis. The Kruskal-Wallis and Spearman rank tests, multivariate logistic regression and the random forest method were applied to assess the association of circulating tumor cells with aggressive prostate cancer.  Results:   Of patients with localized prostate cancer 54% were scored as having positive circulating tumor cells, which was associated with a higher Gleason score (p=0.0003), risk group (p <0.0001) and clinically significant prostate cancer (p <0.0001). In the prebiopsy group a positive circulating tumor cell score combined with prostate specific antigen predicted clinically significant prostate cancer (AUC 0.869). A 12-gene panel prognostic for clinically significant prostate cancer was also identified. When combining the prostate specific antigen level, the circulating tumor cell score and the 12-gene panel, the AUC of clinically significant prostate cancer prediction was 0.927. Adding those data to cases with available multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging data significantly increased prediction accuracy (AUC 0.936 vs 0.629).

CISH and qRT-PCR analysis demonstrated that miR-608 was low expressed in PCa tissues and cells, which was partly attributed to the methylation of CpG island adjacent to the transcription start site (TSS) of miR-608 gene. Intracellular miR-608 overexpression inhibited in vivo PCa tumor growth, and suppressed PCa cell proliferation, G2/M transition, and migration in vitro, which was independent of EMT-associated mechanisms. Then RAC2, a GTPase previously deemed hematopoiesis-specific but now discovered to exist and play important roles in PCa, was verified by western blot and dual-luciferase reporter assays to mediate the effects of miR-608 through RAC2/PAK4/LIMK1/cofilin pathway. MiR-608 also promoted the apoptosis of PCa cells through BCL2L1/caspase-3 pathway by targeting the 3'-UTR of BCL2L1. Moreover, PAK4, the downstream effector of RAC2, was found to be targeted by miR-608 at the mRNA coding sequence (CDS) instead of the canonical 3'-UTR. Knocking down RAC2, PAK4, or BCL2L1 with siRNAs reproduced the antiproliferative, mitosis-obstructive, antimigratory and proapoptotic effects of miR-608 in PCa cells, which could be attenuated by downregulating miR-608. In conclusion, miR-608 suppresses PCa progression, and its activation provides a new therapeutic option for PCa.""","""['Xu Zhang', 'Jiajie Fang', 'Shiming Chen', 'Weiyu Wang', 'Shuai Meng', 'Ben Liu']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Cancer Med""","""['miR-1266-5p and miR-185-5p Promote Cell Apoptosis in Human Prostate Cancer Cell Lines.', 'microRNA-802 inhibits epithelial-mesenchymal transition through targeting flotillin-2 in human prostate cancer.', 'MicroRNA-107 inhibits proliferation of prostate cancer cells by targeting cyclin E1.', 'miR-326 functions as a tumor suppressor in human prostatic carcinoma by targeting Mucin1.', 'MiR-199a/b-3p suppresses migration and invasion of breast cancer cells by downregulating PAK4/MEK/ERK signaling pathway.', 'Transcriptional Profiling Identifies Prognostic Gene Signatures for Conjunctival Extranodal Marginal Zone Lymphoma.', 'The role of p21-activated kinase 4 in the progression of oral squamous cell carcinoma by targeting PI3K-AKT signaling pathway.', 'Recent advances on development of p21-activated kinase 4 inhibitors as anti-tumor agents.', 'MiR-199a/b-3p inhibits colorectal cancer cell proliferation, migration and invasion through targeting PAK4 and BCAR3.', 'LIMK1: A promising prognostic and immune infiltration indicator in colorectal cancer.']"""

Materials and methods:   Human prostate cancer cell line LNCaP was divided into control group, mannitol group, and high glucose group. Then, the proliferation in each group was detected via methyl-thiazolyl-tetrazolium (MTT) assay. Hoechst staining assay was performed to determine the apoptosis level in each group. Western blotting was employed to measure the expression levels of apoptosis-related proteins and nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), and γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase (γ-GCS) proteins. The cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) level was measured through 2,7-dichloro-dihydro-fluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA) assay. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was carried out to detect the content of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and inflammatory factors.  Results:   High glucose significantly promoted the proliferation of prostate cancer cells LNCaP (p<0.01) and increased the apoptosis level of cells (p<0.01). In high glucose group, the expression level of Caspase-3 protein was overtly increased (p<0.01), while that of B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2)/Bcl-2 associated X protein (Bax) was significantly decreased (p<0.01). High glucose group had clearly increased the content of ROS (p<0.01), LDH (p<0.01), and interleukin-6 (IL-6) (p<0.01), but decreased the content of IL-10 (p<0.01). High glucose notably lowered the protein expression levels of Nrf2, HO-1, and γ-GCS in the cells (p<0.01).  Conclusions:   High glucose represses the activation of the Nrf2/anti-oxidation response element (ARE) signaling pathway in prostate cancer cells and increases the content of ROS, IL-6, and the expression of apoptotic proteins in the cells, thus promoting the apoptosis of prostate cancer cells.""","""['J-Y Chen', 'F-B Wang', 'H Xu', 'L-F Xu', 'D Chen', 'W-H Liu', 'X Mu', 'Y-Q Wen']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci""","""['Dexmedetomidine alleviates hepatic injury via the inhibition of oxidative stress and activation of the Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway.', 'Paeoniflorin protects Schwann cells against high glucose induced oxidative injury by activating Nrf2/ARE pathway and inhibiting apoptosis.', 'Salvianolic Acid A Protects Against Oxidative Stress and Apoptosis Induced by Intestinal Ischemia-Reperfusion Injury Through Activation of Nrf2/HO-1 Pathways.', 'Activation of Nrf2 by Sulforaphane Inhibits High Glucose-Induced Progression of Pancreatic Cancer via AMPK Dependent Signaling.', 'Upregulation of Periostin Prevents High Glucose-Induced Mitochondrial Apoptosis in Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells via Activation of Nrf2/HO-1 Signaling.', 'Global, regional, and national time trends in cancer mortality attributable to high fasting plasma glucose: an age-period cohort analysis.', 'Pharmacological Significance of Heme Oxygenase 1 in Prostate Cancer.', 'NRF2: A crucial regulator for mitochondrial metabolic shift and prostate cancer progression.', 'mRNA-Modified FUS/NRF2 Signalling Inhibits Ferroptosis and Promotes Prostate Cancer Growth.', 'Celecoxib ameliorates diabetic neuropathy by decreasing apoptosis and oxidative stress in dorsal root ganglion neurons via the miR-155/COX-2 axis.']"""

The objective is, therefore, to examine the relation between co-morbid CVD at cancer diagnosis and HRQoL among cancer survivors diagnosed with colorectal, thyroid, prostate, endometrium, ovarian cancer, melanoma, (non-)Hodgkin lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), or multiple myeloma (MM) in an exploratory population-based cross-sectional study.Material and methods: Analyses were performed on combined data sets from the PROFILES and Netherlands Cancer Registry (NCR). Data on co-morbid CVD at cancer diagnosis was extracted from the NCR. HRQoL was measured via PROFILES at a median of 4.6 years after cancer diagnosis. General Linear Model Analyses were run for the total group of cancer survivors and for each malignancy.Results: In total, 5930 cancer survivors (2281 colorectal, 280 thyroid, 1054 prostate, 177 endometrium, 389 ovarian cancer, 212 melanoma, 874 non-Hodgkin and 194 Hodgkin lymphoma, 242 CLL, and 227 MM survivors) were included. For the total group, survivors who had a CVD at cancer diagnosis (n = 1441, 23.4%) reported statistically significant and clinically important lower scores on global QoL and physical functioning and higher scores for dyspnea (p < .05) compared to those without CVD. Co-morbid CVD at cancer diagnosis was negatively related to global QoL, the five functional scales and the symptoms fatigue and dyspnea across most malignancies (i.e., colorectal, and prostate cancer, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, ovarium cancer, melanoma, and CLL).

Systematic feedback is also essential for each surgeon to improve his/her performance.  Methods:   RP outcome data (e.g., pT-stage and margin status) have been registered at Sahlgrenska University Hospital (SUH) since 1988 and patient-related outcome measures (PROM) have been registered since 2001. The National Prostate Cancer Registry (NPCR) has covered all Regions in Sweden since 1998 and includes PROM-data from 2008. Initially PROM was on-paper questionnaires but due since 2018 all PROMs are collected electronically. In 2014 an on-line ""dashboard"" panel was introduced, showing the results for ten quality-control variables in real-time. Since 2017 all RP data on hospital, regional, and national levels are publicly accessible on-line on ""www.npcr.se/RATTEN"".  Results:   The early PROM-data from SUH have been used for internal quality control. As national clinical and PROM-data from the NPCR have been made accessible on-line and in real-time we have incorporated this into our pre-existing protocol. Our data are now internally available as real-time NPCR reports on the individual surgeons' results, as well as ePROM data. We can compare the results of each surgeon internally and to other departments' aggregated data. The public can access data and compare hospital level data on ""RATTEN"".

Methods Patients were treated with AT-101 (40 mg) every 12 h on days 1, 2 and 3 of each cycle combined with varying dose levels (DL) of paclitaxel and carboplatin [DL1: paclitaxel (150 mg/m2) and carboplatin (AUC 5) on day 1 of each cycle; DL2: paclitaxel (175 mg/m2) and carboplatin (AUC 6) on day 1 of each cycle]. Secondary objectives included characterizing toxicity, efficacy, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of the combination. Results Twenty-four patients were treated across two DLs with a planned expansion cohort. The most common tumor type was prostate (N = 11). Two patients experienced DLTs: grade 3 abdominal pain at DL1 and grade 3 ALT increase at DL2; however, the MTD was not determined. Moderate hematologic toxicity was observed. One CR was seen in a patient with esophageal cancer and 4 patients achieved PRs (1 NSCLC, 3 prostate).

This paper explores the relationships between epistemic risks in cancer diagnosis and screening, the social organization of medical research and practice, and policy making; it does this by examining 2018 recommendations by the United States Preventative Services Task Force that patients make individualized, autonomy-based decisions about cancer screening on the basis of discussions with their physicians. While the paper focuses on prostate cancer screening, the issues that it raises are relevant to other cancer screening programs, especially breast cancer. The paper argues that prostate cancer screening-and, more generally, the process of risk assessment for prostate cancer-is pervaded by epistemic risks that reflect value judgments and that the pervasiveness of these epistemic risks creates significant and under-explored difficulties for physician-patient communication and the achievement of autonomous patient decision making.""","""['Justin B Biddle']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Stud Hist Philos Biol Biomed Sci""","""['Communicating benefits and risks of screening for prostate, colon, and breast cancer.', 'Persuasive Interventions for Controversial Cancer Screening Recommendations: Testing a Novel Approach to Help Patients Make Evidence-Based Decisions.', 'Prostate Cancer Screening.', 'PSA testing for men at average risk of prostate cancer.', 'Can you un-ring the bell?

However, the clinical significance and biological role of PTOV1 remain elusive in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).  Methods:   The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data and NCBI/GEO data mining, western blotting analysis and immunohistochemistry were employed to characterize the expression of PTOV1 in NSCLC cell lines and tissues. The clinical significance of PTOV1 in NSCLC was studied by immunohistochemistry statistical analysis and Kaplan-Meier Plotter database mining. A series of in-vivo and in-vitro assays, including colony formation, CCK-8 assays, flow cytometry, wound healing, trans-well assay, tumor sphere formation, quantitative PCR, gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA), immunostaining and xenografts tumor model, were performed to demonstrate the effects of PTOV1 on chemosensitivity of NSCLC cells and the underlying mechanisms.  Results:   PTOV1 is overexpressed in NSCLC cell lines and tissues. High PTOV1 level indicates a short survival time and poor response to chemotherapy of NSCLC patients. Depleting PTOV1 increased sensitivity to chemotherapy drugs cisplatin and docetaxel by increasing cell apoptosis, inhibiting cell migration and invasion. Our study verified that depleting PTOV1 attenuated cancer stem cell traits through impairing DKK1/β-catenin signaling to enhance chemosensitivity of NSCLC cells.  Conclusion:   These results suggest that PTOV1 plays an important role in the development and progression of human NSCLC and PTOV1 may serve as a therapeutic target for NSCLC patients.""","""['Zhiqiang Wu', 'Zhuang Liu', 'Xiangli Jiang', 'Zeyun Mi', 'Maobin Meng', 'Hui Wang', 'Jinlin Zhao', 'Boyu Zheng', 'Zhiyong Yuan']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""J Exp Clin Cancer Res""","""['Depleting DDX1 sensitizes non-small cell lung cancer cells to chemotherapy by attenuating cancer stem cell traits.', 'TRIM47 overexpression is a poor prognostic factor and contributes to carcinogenesis in non-small cell lung carcinoma.', 'Elevated expression of BIRC6 protein in non-small-cell lung cancers is associated with cancer recurrence and chemoresistance.', 'LRIG and cancer prognosis.', 'Proteomic biomarkers of non-small cell lung cancer patients.', 'SPATA2 suppresses epithelial-mesenchymal transition to inhibit metastasis and radiotherapy sensitivity in non-small cell lung cancer via impairing DVL1/β-catenin signaling.', 'A new risk model for CSTA, FAM83A, and MYCT1 predicts poor prognosis and is related to immune infiltration in lung squamous cell carcinoma.', 'miR-26a-5p Suppresses Wnt/β-Catenin Signaling Pathway by Inhibiting DNMT3A-Mediated SFRP1 Methylation and Inhibits Cancer Stem Cell-Like Properties of NSCLC.', 'Immune- and Stemness-Related Genes Revealed by Comprehensive Analysis and Validation for Cancer Immunity and Prognosis and Its Nomogram in Lung Adenocarcinoma.', 'SGK2, 14-3-3, and HUWE1 Cooperate to Control the Localization, Stability, and Function of the Oncoprotein PTOV1.']"""

Methods:   A total of 19 patients with prostate cancer were selected retrospectively. Weekly magnetic resonance image (MRI) scans were acquired for 5 weeks for each patient to observe the anatomic changes during the treatment course. Initial intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) plans (iIMRT) were generated for each patient with 13 coplanar 60Co beams on a ViewRay™ system. Two techniques were applied: patient repositioning and replanning. For patient repositioning, one plan was created: soft-tissue (prostate) matching (Soft). The dose distribution was calculated for each MRI with the beam delivery parameters from the initial IMRT plan. The replanning technique was used to generate the Adaptive plan, which was the reoptimized plan for the weekly MRI. The dose-volumetric parameters of the planning target volume (PTV), bladder, and rectum were calculated for all plans. During the treatment course, the PTV, bladder, and rectum were evaluated for changes in volume and the effect on dosimetric parameters. The differences between the dose-volumetric parameters of the plans were examined through the Wilcoxon test. The initial plan was used as a baseline to compare the differences.  Results:   The Adaptive plan showed better target coverage during the treatment period, but the change was not significant in the Soft plan. There were significant differences in D98%, D95%, and D2% in PTV between the Soft and Adaptive plans (p < 0.05) except for Dmean. There was no significant change in Dmax and Dmean as the treatment progressed with all plans. All indices for the Adaptive plan stayed the same compared to those of iIMRT during the treatment course. There were significant differences in D15%, D25%, D35%, and D50% in the bladder between the Soft and Adaptive plans. The Adaptive plan showed the worse dose sparing than the Soft plan for the bladder according to each dosimetric index. In contrast to the bladder, the Adaptive plan achieved better sparing than the Soft plan during the treatment course. The significant differences were only observed in D15% and D35% between the Soft and Adaptive plans (p < 0.05).  Conclusions:   Patient repositioning based on the target volume (Soft plan) can relatively retain the target coverage for patients and the OARs remain at a clinically tolerance level during the treatment course. The Adaptive plan did not clinically improve for the dose delivered to OARs, it kept the dose delivered to the target volume constant.

We explored the efficacy and mechanism of circular RNA circZNF609 (circZNF609) on colony formation, viability, apoptosis, migration and invasion and in PC cells. Methods: Colony formation, CCK-8, flow cytometry, migration and invasion assay were respectively used to detect the functions of circZNF609 and microRNA (miR)-186-5p on cell colony ability, viability, apoptosis, migration and invasion. circZNF609 and miR-186-5p expression were changed by cell transfection and tested by RT-qPCR. Moreover, Cleaved-Caspase-3, Cleaved-Caspase-9, matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), Vimentin and relate-proteins of cell pathways were examined through Western blot. Results: circZNF609 was highly expressed at PC tissues. circZNF609 declined cell colony ability, viability, migration and invasion and caused apoptosis. Furthermore, circZNF609 negatively regulated miR-186-5p, miR-186-5p inhibitor could reverse impacts of circZNF609.

The optimal use in this context remains to be determined. The human prostatic cancer cell line LNCaP has been used in several previous proteomic analysis studies, which confirmed that sms indeed can affect the protein expression in this cell line. Proteomic analysis is an important tool to increase the understanding of how sms affects the protein expression of the tumor cell.  Materials and methods:   In this in vitro study, a new sms14 derivative, smsdx, a conjugate between sms14 and dextran, was incubated with an LNCaP cell culture. Sms14 was used as the positive control. Proteomic analysis, using rapid mini two-dimensional electrophoresis, was performed to determine the effects on protein expression.  Results:   Marked quantitative differences were observed in the protein expression profiles in smsdx-treated LNCaP cells compared to negative control cells (untreated cells). Sets of 63 (yet unidentified) protein spots were differentially expressed. The difference was statistically significant (Mann-Whitney analysis). The 63 dataset was used to accurately discriminate control cells from smsdx-treated cells using hierarchical cluster analysis. Both similarities and differences in protein expression were observed between smsdx- and sms14-treated cells.  Conclusion:   Smsdx is a new sms14 derivative with long in vivo half-life and pan receptor affinity. Sms14-like effects on the protein expression of LNCaP cells seem to be preserved in the construct.

Because of its strong nucleophilicity, the metabolite can react directly with protein thiols to cause redox modification. These chemical changes have never been examined systematically before because of the lack of a reliable methodology to study reactive protein thiols globally in cells and to quantify their redox status.  Materials and methods:   PC-3 human prostate cancer cells were treated with methylseleninic acid (MSA) for 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 6, 12 or 24 h. A reactive thiol specific reagent, BIAM, was used to detect the extent of global redox changes on a 2D gel electrophoresis display. The data were analyzed by the Self Organizing Maps clustering algorithm. Protein identification was done by MALDI-TOF and ESI-tandem mass spectrometry.  Results:   Out of a total of 194 reactive thiol-containing protein spots on the 2D gel display, 100 of them (cluster 1) were not sensitive to MSA modulation. The remaining 94 were categorized into three distinct patterns. Cluster 2 (60 proteins) showed an immediate and sustained loss of reactive thiols for at least 24 h; cluster 3 (19 proteins) showed a transient loss of reactive thiols followed by a rapid rebound; and cluster 4 (15 proteins) showed a transient gain followed by a rapid return to normal. In contrast, there were minimal protein redox changes in control cells (not treated with MSA) over the same period of time. A total of 85 proteins were identified of which 40 were in clusters 2 to 4. The proteins which are sensitive to redox modification by MSA are distributed in various subcellular compartments. Western blot analysis showed that a number of chaperones were significantly induced by MSA.  Conclusion:   Global redox modification of proteins can be a major driving force of cellular stress, since these changes are likely to lead to protein unfolding, misfolding or aggregation. The induction of chaperones in cells treated with MSA is consistent with this interpretation since chaperones are charged with rescuing misfolded proteins. The above scenario is discussed in relation to an adaptive response which ultimately determines how cells respond to treatment with selenium.""","""['Eun-Mi Park', 'Kyoung-Soo Choi', 'Soo-Yeon Park', 'Eung-Sik Kong', 'K E Zu', 'Yue Wu', 'Haitao Zhang', 'Clement Ip', 'Young-Mee Park']""","""[]""","""2005""","""None""","""Cancer Genomics Proteomics""","""['Neural network-based analysis of thiol proteomics data in identifying potential selenium targets.', 'Analysis of protein redox modification by hypoxia.', 'Endoplasmic reticulum stress signal mediators are targets of selenium action.', 'Measurement and meaning of cellular thiol:disufhide redox status.', 'Selenium and anticarcinogenesis: underlying mechanisms.', 'Differential Inhibition of Anaplerotic Pyruvate Carboxylation and Glutaminolysis-Fueled Anabolism Underlies Distinct Toxicity of Selenium Agents in Human Lung Cancer.', 'Exposure to the Methylselenol Precursor Dimethyldiselenide Induces a Reductive Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.', 'Methylselenol Produced In Vivo from Methylseleninic Acid or Dimethyl Diselenide Induces Toxic Protein Aggregation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.', 'Selenium and selenoproteins in viral infection with potential relevance to COVID-19.']"""

Most PCa cases are not fatal; however, the outlook is poor when PCa spreads to another organ. Bone is the target organ in about 80% of patients who experience metastasis from a primary PCa tumor. In the present study, we characterized the secretome of PC3/nKR cells, which are a new subline of PC3 cells that were originally isolated from nude mice that were implanted with PC3 cells without anti-natural killer (NK) cell treatment. Wound healing and Transwell assays revealed that PC3/nKR cells had increased migratory and invasive activities in addition to a higher resistance to NK cells-induced cytotoxicity as compared to PC3 cells. We quantitatively profiled the secreted proteins of PC3/nKR and PC3 cells by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analysis coupled with 2-plex tandem mass tag labeling. In total, 598 secretory proteins were identified, and 561 proteins were quantified, among which 45 proteins were secreted more and 40 proteins were secreted less by PC3/nKR cells than by PC3 cells. For validation, the adapter molecule crk, serpin B3, and cystatin-M were analyzed by western blotting. PC3/nKR cells showed the selective secretion of NKG2D ligand 2, HLA-A, and IL-6, which may contribute to their NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity resistance, and had a high secretion of crk protein, which may contribute to their high migration and invasion properties. Based on our secretome analysis, we propose that PC3/nKR cells represent a new cell system for studying the metastasis and progression of PCa.""","""['Ju Mi Jeon', 'Oh Kwang Kwon', 'Ann-Yae Na', 'Eun Ji Sung', 'Il Je Cho', 'Mirae Kim', 'Sung Su Yea', 'So Young Chun', 'Jun Hyung Lee', 'Yun-Sok Ha', 'Tae Gyun Kwon', 'Sangkyu Lee']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Correction: Secretome profiling of PC3/nKR cells, a novel highly migrating prostate cancer subline derived from PC3 cells.', 'Correction: Secretome profiling of PC3/nKR cells, a novel highly migrating prostate cancer subline derived from PC3 cells.', 'Exosomes secreted by prostate cancer cells under hypoxia promote matrix metalloproteinases activity at pre-metastatic niches.', 'Regulation of prostate cancer cell migration toward bone marrow stromal cell-conditioned medium by Wnt5a signaling.', 'HO-1 Interactors Involved in the Colonization of the Bone Niche: Role of ANXA2 in Prostate Cancer Progression.', 'Roles of highly expressed bone-specific genes in bone metastatic prostate cancer PC3 cells: Advances in studies.', 'Correction: Secretome profiling of PC3/nKR cells, a novel highly migrating prostate cancer subline derived from PC3 cells.']"""

Studies have showed that the alternation of miRNAs expression in cancer is relevant to pathogenesis of tumor. In present study, we aimed to investigate functions of miR-214-5p in PCa.  Materials and methods:   10 paired human prostate tumor tissues and homologous para-tumor tissues were recruited, and the levels of miR-214-5p and CRMP5 were respectively determined by qRT-PCR assay. Luciferase activity analysis was performed to explore the regulation of CRMP5 mRNA 3'UTR by miR-214-5p. Then, cell experiments, including cell proliferation, apoptosis, cell cycle, migration and colony formation ability, were performed after proper plasmids or RNAs transfection.  Results:   In PCa tissues and cell lines, expression of miR-214-5p was decreased compared with para-tumor tissues or normal prostate epithelial cell lines. Luciferase activity assay showed a direct combination of miR-214-5p and CRMP5 mRNA 3'UTR, and indicated that the absence of miR-214-5p in PCa cells may contributes to a high level of CRMP5. Cell experiments showed that miR-214-5p can induce inhibition of tumor cell growth, migration and colony forming efficiency, promotion of apoptosis and G1-phase arrest, on the other hand, co-expression of CRMP5 somewhat counteracted these phenotype induced by miR-214-5p.  Conclusion:   Taken together, miR-214-5p shows tumor suppression effects in PCa cells. Loss expression of miR-214-5p in PCa increase levels of CRMP5 through regulating CRMP5 3'UTR, which could be a potential therapy target for PCa.""","""['Chenghao Zheng', 'Kai Guo', 'Binshen Chen', 'Yong Wen', 'Yawen Xu']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Cancer Biomark""","""['Tumor-Suppressive Function of miR-30d-5p in Prostate Cancer Cell Proliferation and Migration by Targeting NT5E.', 'Long non-coding RNA-NEAT1, a sponge for miR-98-5p, promotes expression of oncogene HMGA2 in prostate cancer.', 'miR-1266-5p and miR-185-5p Promote Cell Apoptosis in Human Prostate Cancer Cell Lines.', 'The role of microRNAs in prostate cancer migration, invasion, and metastasis.', 'A comprehensive review on miR-451: A promising cancer biomarker with therapeutic potential.', 'MicroRNA miR-214-5p induces senescence of microvascular endothelial cells by targeting the JAG1/Notch signaling pathway.', 'Racial differences in RAD51 expression are regulated by miRNA-214-5P and its inhibition synergizes with olaparib in triple-negative breast cancer.', 'The Potential of MicroRNAs as Non-Invasive Prostate Cancer Biomarkers: A Systematic Literature Review Based on a Machine Learning Approach.', ""MicroRNAs as Potential Tools for Predicting Cancer Patients' Susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 Infection and Vaccination Response."", 'Cyanidin-3-O-glucoside inhibits the β-catenin/MGMT pathway by upregulating miR-214-5p to reverse chemotherapy resistance in glioma cells.']"""

Black raspberry extract, the anthocyanin cyanidin-3-rutinoside and protocatechuic acid did not inhibit prostate cancer cell growth in vitro, but ellagic acid and its urolithin A metabolite did at high concentrations. Prostate cancer cell migration was not affected by these agents nor was growth in soft agar, except that ellagic acid reduced colony formation at physiological concentrations and protocatechuic acid at high concentrations. Low bioavailability of bioactive berry compounds and metabolites may limit exposure of tissues such as the prostate, since we found that cyanidin-3-rutinoside was not bioavailable to prostate cancer cells, but its aglycone cyanidin was and inhibited their growth.

Of 6246 hospitalized patients, 1154 were with established diagnosis of DVT and included in the study as a basic inclusion criterion. Results Provoked venous thromboembolism was recorded in 45.75% of hospitalized patients. In 54.25% cases DVT was classified as idiopathic; in the remaining cases with DVT external risk factors were identified. Every fourth patient had a history of malignancy, and this risk factor was significantly more common among women and younger patients. Cancer of female reproductive organs, colon, lung, breast and prostate cancer were most common. One of 10 women had DVT during pregnancy or postpartum period.

However, men are much less likely to seek genetic counseling and testing than their at-risk female relatives. To facilitate access to pre-test information and testing, we developed a web-based intervention (WI) for men that we are evaluating in a pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT). This paper describes three phases of research in the development of the WI: (1) formative (qualitative) research among men from BRCA1/2 families to assess needs and preferences for education; (2) a detailed description of the organization, format, and content of the WI; and (3) usability testing. We discuss the aims and hypotheses of the pilot RCT in which the WI is being compared with an enhanced usual care condition among at-risk men.

RUF repair is challenging, especially in irradiated patients.  Objective:   To evaluate the efficacy of the York Mason (YM) procedure with or without concomitant gracilis muscle interposition (graciloplasty) for RUF repair.  Design, setting, and participants:   Records of patients with an iatrogenic RUF who underwent the YM procedure between 2008 and 2018 in two university hospitals were reviewed. Data on etiology, diagnostic and operative procedures, urinary and fecal diversion, and postoperative follow-up were collected.  Intervention:   Twenty-eight patients underwent 33 YM procedures. Concomitant graciloplasty was performed in four (14%) primary repairs and two (7%) repairs for recurrent RUFs.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   The primary endpoint was successful RUF repair, defined as absence of symptoms and no leakage on control urethrocystography. The secondary endpoint was colostomy reversal rate.  Results and limitations:   Median follow-up was 24 mo. Ten patients (36%) were irradiated previously. The ultimate success rate was 75% after a maximum of three YM procedures. Success rates were 89% and 50% in patients with nonirradiated and irradiated fistulas, respectively. In irradiated patients, the success rates of the first YM procedure with and without graciloplasty were 100% and 29%, respectively. In recurrent cases, concomitant graciloplasty did not result in better outcomes. Colostomy reversal was possible in 15 patients after successful repair. In all patients, fecal continence was intact and no anal stenosis was reported. Limitations of the study include small sample size and the retrospective design.  Conclusions:   Combination of the YM procedure with graciloplasty resulted in higher success rates of RUF repair in patients with irradiated fistulas. Fecal continence was preserved, and colostomy reversal is feasible.  Patient summary:   We analyzed the outcomes, complications, and colostomy reversal rate of the York Mason procedure for the repair of rectourethral fistulas (RUFs). We found that concomitant graciloplasty increases success rates in case of prior radiation therapy.

Nevertheless, the impact of chemotherapy on patient survival is limited and clinical outcome remain dismal. Bromodomain and extraterminal inhibitors (BETis) are attractive therapeutic agents and currently in clinical trials to be tested for their efficacy in prostate cancer patients.  Objective:   In this study, we evaluated the activity of two clinical stage BETis, INCB054329 and INCB057643, alone and in combination with chemotherapeutics used for the treatment of mCRPC.  Design, setting, and participants:   Drug activity was evaluated in vitro by MTT, clonogenic, prostato-sphere, and flow cytometry assays. The activity in vivo was evaluated in mice bearing prostate tumor (22Rv1) xenografts.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Cell growth data were analyzed to determine the maximum effect and the concentration that reduces by 50%. For concomitant treatments, the combination index was determined according to the Chou-Talalay method. For in vivo activity, changes in tumor size (T/Ci%), weight (T/Cd%), doubling time, and mouse body weight were monitored. Statistical significance was determined by one-way analysis of variance followed by a Student-Newman-Keuls or Turkey a posteriori test.  Results and limitations:   INCB054329 and INCB057643 had significant activity as single agents in human prostate cancer cell lines and 22Rv1 tumor xenografts. Combined treatment with INCB057643 and any of docetaxel, olaparib, or carboplatin was synergistic/additive in vitro. Notably, INCB057643, given with a low-intensity dosing schedule, greatly enhanced the anti-tumor activity of docetaxel, carboplatin, and olaparib in 22Rv1 tumor xenografts.  Conclusions:   Collectively, these results provide the first evidence of the therapeutic benefit obtainable by combining BETis with non-androgen receptor-targeted therapies for the treatment of mCRPC.

However, target genes for the majority of risk loci remain largely unexplored. It is also unclear whether GWAS risk-loci-associated genes contribute to mutational signatures and tumor mutational burden (TMB) in cancer tissues. We systematically conducted cis-expression quantitative trait loci (cis-eQTL) analyses for 294 GWAS-identified variants for six major types of cancer-colorectal, lung, ovary, prostate, pancreas, and melanoma-by using transcriptome data from the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) Project, the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), and other public data sources. By using integrative analysis strategies, we identified 270 candidate target genes, including 99 with previously unreported associations, for six cancer types. By analyzing functional genomic data, our results indicate that 180 genes (66.7% of 270) had evidence of cis-regulation by putative functional variants via proximal promoter or distal enhancer-promoter interactions. Together with our previously reported associations for breast cancer risk, our results show that 24 genes are shared by at least two cancer types, including four genes for both breast and ovarian cancer. By integrating mutation data from TCGA, we found that expression levels of 33 and 66 putative susceptibility genes were associated with specific mutational signatures and TMB of cancer-driver genes, respectively, at a Bonferroni-corrected p < 0.05. Together, these findings provide further insight into our understanding of how genetic risk variants might contribute to carcinogenesis through the regulation of susceptibility genes that are related to the biogenesis of somatic mutations.""","""['Zhishan Chen', 'Wanqing Wen', 'Alicia Beeghly-Fadiel', 'Xiao-Ou Shu', 'Virginia Díez-Obrero', 'Jirong Long', 'Jiandong Bao', 'Jing Wang', 'Qi Liu', 'Qiuyin Cai', 'Victor Moreno', 'Wei Zheng', 'Xingyi Guo']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Am J Hum Genet""","""['A Comprehensive cis-eQTL Analysis Revealed Target Genes in Breast Cancer Susceptibility Loci Identified in Genome-wide Association Studies.', 'A Transcriptome-Wide Association Study Among 97,898 Women to Identify Candidate Susceptibility Genes for Epithelial Ovarian Cancer Risk.', 'In silico pathway analysis and tissue specific cis-eQTL for colorectal cancer GWAS risk variants.', 'Lessons from postgenome-wide association studies: functional analysis of cancer predisposition loci.', 'Integrative eQTL-based analyses reveal the biology of breast cancer risk loci.', 'Germline Cancer Gene Expression Quantitative Trait Loci Are Associated with Local and Global Tumor Mutations.', 'Integrating transcription factor occupancy with transcriptome-wide association analysis identifies susceptibility genes in human cancers.', 'Functional studies of lung cancer GWAS beyond association.', 'Association between germline variants and somatic mutations in colorectal cancer.', '3D chromatin architecture and transcription regulation in cancer.']"""

In United States, PCa incidence is affected by period effect of U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendation. However, no study has reported the effect of USPSTF recommendation or aging phenomenon on PCa incidence in South Korea. Thus, the objective of this study was to investigate effects of age, period, and birth cohort on PCa incidence using age-period-cohort analysis.  Materials and methods:   Annual report of cancer statistics between 2003 and 2013 from National Health Insurance Service (NHIS) in South Korea for the number of PCa patients and Korean Statistical Information Service (KOSIS) data between 2003 and 2013 from national statistics in South Korea for the number of Korean male population were used. Age-period-cohort models were used to investigate effects of age, period, and birth cohort on PCa incidence.  Results:   Overall PCa incidence in South Korea was increased 8.8% in annual percentage (95% confidential interval, 6.5 to 11.2; p < 0.001). It showed an increasing pattern from 2003 to 2011 but a decreasing pattern from 2011 to 2013. Age increased the risk of PCa incidence. However, the speed of increase was slower with increasing age. PCa incidence was increased 1.4 times in 2008 compared to that in 2003 or 2013. Regarding cohort effect, the risk of PCa incidence started to increase from 1958 cohort.  Conclusion:   PCa incidence was affected by period of specific year.

The purpose of this study is to investigate advanced TG-186 model-based dose calculations via retrospective dosimetric and radiobiological analysis for a new patient cohort.  Methods and materials:   A cohort of 155 patients treated with permanent implant prostate brachytherapy from The Ottawa Hospital Cancer Centre is considered. Monte Carlo (MC) dose calculations are performed using tissue-based virtual patient models. Dose-volume histogram (DVH) metrics (target, organs at risk) are extracted from 3D dose distributions and compared with those from calculations under TG-43 assumptions (TG43). Equivalent uniform biologically effective dose and tumor control probability are calculated.  Results:   For the target, D90 (V100) is 136.7 ± 20.6 Gy (85.8% ± 7.8%) for TG43 and 132.8 ± 20.1 Gy (84.1% ± 8.2%) for MC; D90 is 3.0% ± 1.1% lower for MC than TG43. For organs at risk, MC D1cc = 104.4 ± 27.4 Gy (TG43: 106.3 ± 28.3 Gy) for rectum and 80.8 ± 29.7 Gy (TG43: 78.4 ± 28.4 Gy) for bladder; D1cc = 185.9 ± 30.2 Gy (TG43: 191.1 ± 32.0 Gy) for urethra. Equivalent uniform biologically effective dose and tumor control probability are generally lower when evaluated using MC doses. The largest dosimetric and radiobiological discrepancies between TG43 and MC are for patients with intraprostatic calcifications, for whom there are low doses (cold spots) in the vicinity of calcifications within the target, identified with MC but not TG43.  Conclusions:   DVH metrics and radiobiological indices evaluated with TG43 are systematically inaccurate by upward of several percent compared with MC patient-specific models. Mean cohort DVH metrics and their MC:TG43 variances are sensitive to patient cohort and clinical practice, underlining the importance of further retrospective MC studies toward widespread clinical adoption of advanced model-based dose calculations.""","""['Ali-Reza Mehan Haidari', 'Nelson Miksys', 'Paul Soubiran', 'Joanna Ewa Cygler', 'Oliver Holmes', 'Gad Perry', 'Rowan M Thomson']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Brachytherapy""","""['Coupling I-125 permanent implant prostate brachytherapy Monte Carlo dose calculations with radiobiological models.', 'Evaluation of dosimetric effects of metallic artifact reduction and tissue assignment on Monte Carlo dose calculations for 125 I prostate implants.', 'Investigation of interseed attenuation and tissue composition effects in (125)I seed implant prostate brachytherapy.', 'A review of dosimetric impact of implementation of model-based dose calculation algorithms (MBDCAs) for HDR brachytherapy.', 'Model-Based Dose Calculation Algorithms for Brachytherapy Dosimetry.']"""

Methods:   GRASP-Pro reconstruction enforces a combination of an explicit low-rank subspace-constraint and a temporal sparsity constraint. The temporal basis used to construct the subspace is learned from an intermediate reconstruction step using the low-resolution portion of radial k-space, which eliminates the need for generating the basis using auxiliary data or a physical signal model. A convolutional neural network was trained to generate the contrast enhancement curve in the artery, from which clinically relevant contrast phases are automatically selected for evaluation. The performance of GRASP-Pro was demonstrated for high spatiotemporal resolution DCE-MRI of the prostate and was compared against standard GRASP in terms of overall image quality, image sharpness, and residual streaks and/or noise level.  Results:   Compared to GRASP, GRASP-Pro reconstructed dynamic images with enhanced sharpness, less residual streaks and/or noise, and finer delineation of the prostate without prolonging reconstruction time. The image quality improvement reached statistical significance (P < 0.05) in all the assessment categories. The neural network successfully generated contrast enhancement curves in the artery, and corresponding peak enhancement indexes correlated well with that from the manual selection.

Curiously, low expression of hepsin is associated with poor survival in different cancer types, and transgenic overexpression of hepsin leads to loss of viability in various cancer cell lines. Here, by comparing isogenic transfectants of the PCa cell line PC-3 providing inducible overexpression of wild-type hepsin (HPN) vs. the protease-deficient mutant HPNS353A, we were able to attribute hepsin-mediated tumor-adverse effects to its excess proteolytic activity. A stem-like expression signature of surface markers and adhesion molecules, Notch intracellular domain release, and increased pericellular protease activity were associated with low expression levels of wild-type hepsin, but were partially lost in response to overexpression. Instead, overexpression of wild-type hepsin, but not of HPNS353A, induced relocalization of the protein to the cytoplasm, and increased autophagic flux in vitro as well as LC3B punctae frequency in tumor xenografts. Confocal microscopy revealed colocalization of wild-type hepsin with both LC3B punctae as well as with the autophagy cargo receptor p62/SQSTM1. Overexpression of wild type, but not protease-deficient hepsin induced expression and nuclear presence of CHOP, indicating activation of the unfolded protein response and ER-associated protein degradation (ERAD). Whereas inhibitors of ER stress and secretory protein trafficking slightly increased viability, combined inhibition of the ubiquitin-proteasome degradation pathway (by bortezomib) with either ER stress (by salubrinal) or autophagy (by bafilomycin A1) revealed a significant decrease of viability during overexpression of wild-type hepsin in PC-3 cells. Our results demonstrate that a precise control of Hepsin proteolytic activity is critical for PCa cell fate and suggest, that the interference with ERAD could be a promising therapeutic option, leading to induction of proteotoxicity in hepsin-overexpressing tumors.""","""['Ramona Willbold', 'Katharina Wirth', 'Thomas Martini', 'Holger Sültmann', 'Christian Bolenz', 'Rainer Wittig']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Cell Death Dis""","""['Correction: Excess hepsin proteolytic activity limits oncogenic signaling and induces ER stress and autophagy in prostate cancer cells.', 'Matrix-dependent regulation of AKT in Hepsin-overexpressing PC3 prostate cancer cells.', 'Carnosic acid promotes degradation of the androgen receptor and is regulated by the unfolded protein response pathway in vitro and in vivo.', 'Regulation of macroautophagy in ovarian cancer cells in vitro and in vivo by controlling glucose regulatory protein 78 and AMPK.', 'Clinical Significance of Hepsin and Underlying Signaling Pathways in Prostate Cancer.', 'Hepsin and prostate cancer.', 'Venetoclax is a potent hepsin inhibitor that reduces the metastatic and prothrombotic phenotypes of hepsin-expressing colorectal cancer cells.', 'Comprehensive characteristics of pathological subtypes in testicular germ cell tumor: Gene expression, mutation and alternative splicing.', 'The roles of proteases in prostate cancer.', 'Implication of Hepsin from Primary Tumor in the Prognosis of Colorectal Cancer Patients.', 'The POR rs10954732 polymorphism decreases susceptibility to hepatocellular carcinoma and hepsin as a prognostic biomarker correlated with immune infiltration based on proteomics.']"""

Since 2015, landmark studies have demonstrated improved survival outcomes with the use of docetaxel (DCT) or abiraterone (AA) in addition to androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) in the metastatic hormone-naïve setting. These treatment strategies have not been prospectively compared but have similar overall survival benefits despite differing mechanisms of action, toxicity, and cost. We performed a cost-effectiveness analysis to provide insight into the value of AA vs. DCT in the first-line treatment of metastatic prostate cancer.  Materials and methods:   We developed Markov models by using a US-payer perspective and a 3-year time horizon to estimate costs (2018 US$) and progression-free quality-adjusted life years (PF-QALYs) for ADT alone, DCT, and AA. Health states were defined as initial state, treatment states according to experience of an adverse event, and progressed disease/death. State transition probabilities were derived from rates for drug discontinuation, frequency of adverse events, disease progression, and death from the randomized phase III trials ChemoHormonal Therapy Versus Androgen Ablation Randomized Trial for Extensive Disease in Prostate Cancer (CHAARTED) and LATITUDE. Univariate and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted to evaluate model uncertainty.  Results:   DCT resulted in an increase of 0.32 PF-QALYs and $16,100 in cost and AA resulted in an increase of 0.52 PF-QALYs and $215,800 in cost compared to ADT alone. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for DCT vs. ADT was $50,500/PF-QALY and for AA vs. DCT was $1,010,000/PF-QALY. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis demonstrated that at a willingness-to-pay threshold of $150,000/PF-QALY AA was highly unlikely to be cost-effective.  Conclusion:   DCT is substantially more cost-effective than AA in the treatment of metastatic hormone naïve prostate cancer.""","""['Chethan Ramamurthy', 'Elizabeth A Handorf', 'Andres F Correa', 'J Robert Beck', 'Daniel M Geynisman']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Urol Oncol""","""[""Cost-effectiveness analysis of Abiraterone Acetate versus Docetaxel in the management of metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer: Hong Kong's perspective."", 'A Cost-effectiveness Analysis of Systemic Therapy for Metastatic Hormone-sensitive Prostate Cancer.', 'Cost-effectiveness model of abiraterone plus prednisone, cabazitaxel plus prednisone and enzalutamide for visceral metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer therapy after docetaxel therapy resistance.', 'The evolving landscape of metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer: a critical review of the evidence for adding docetaxel or abiraterone to androgen deprivation.', 'Cabazitaxel for Hormone-Relapsed Metastatic Prostate Cancer Previously Treated With a Docetaxel-Containing Regimen: An Evidence Review Group Perspective of a NICE Single Technology Appraisal.', 'Survival modelling and cost-effectiveness analysis of treatments for newly diagnosed metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer.', 'Cost-effectiveness of olaparib, a PARP inhibitor, for patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer in China and United States.', 'The Health Economics of Metastatic Hormone-Sensitive and Non-Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer-A Systematic Literature Review with Application to the Canadian Context.', 'Cost-Effectiveness of Systemic Treatments for Metastatic Castration-Sensitive Prostate Cancer: An Economic Evaluation Based on Network Meta-Analysis.', 'Population-Based Study of Docetaxel or Abiraterone Effectiveness and Predictive Markers of Progression Free Survival in Metastatic Castration-Sensitive Prostate Cancer.']"""

Material and methods:   Treatment plans for 27 randomly selected patients were compared using intensity-modulated (IMRT) techniques as Sliding Window (SW), volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT), and helical tomotherapy (HT), as well as Cyber Knife (CK) system. The target dose was calculated to 36.25 Gy delivered in five fractions over 1 week. Dosimetric indices for target volume and organs at risk (OAR) as well as normal tissue complication probability (NTCP) of late rectal and urinary bladder toxicities were analyzed.  Results:   The CK provided lower homogeneity in the target volume, but higher values for most of the conformity indices compared to the IMRT approaches. The SW demonstrated superior rectum sparing at medium-to-high dose range (V18 Gy - V32.6 Gy) compared to other techniques (p < 0.05). The whole urinary bladder experienced the best shielding by SW and VMAT at the medium dose (V18 Gy, p < 0.05 versus CK), however we obtained no relevant differences between techniques at the high dose. Generally, the CK demonstrated significantly superior rectum and bladder exposure at V18 Gy as compared to HT, SW, and VMAT. For the rectum, mean NTCP values were significantly superior for HT (NTCP = 2.3%, p < 0.05), and for urinary bladder, the NTCP showed no significant advantages for any technique.  Conclusion:   No absolute dosimetric advantage was revealed to choose between CK or IMRT techniques for the SBRT of low-grade prostate cancer. Using the same safety margins and dose objectives, IMRT techniques demonstrated superior sparing of the rectum and bladder at a medium dose compared to CK. Comparing different IMRT approaches SW displayed superior rectum sparing at a medium-to-high dose range, whereas both SW and RA revealed superior bladder sparing compared to HT. HT demonstrated a significantly lower NTCP outcome compared to CK or IMRT techniques regarding the rectum.

Receptor-targeting radiolabeled imaging pharmaceuticals with high affinity and specificity are useful in studying and monitoring biological processes and responses. Two potential imaging pharmaceuticals, AMBA agonist (where AMBA = DO3A-CH2CO-G-[4-aminobenzyl]- Gln-Trp-Ala-Val-Gly-His-Leu-Met-NH2) and RM1 antagonist (where RM1 = DO3A-CH2CO-G-[4-aminobenzyl]-D-Phe-Gln-Trp-Ala-Val-Gly-His-Sta-Leu-NH2), have demonstrated high binding affinity (IC50) to GRP receptors and high tumor uptake. Antagonists, despite the poor tumor cell internalization properties, can show clearer images and pharmacokinetic profiles by virtue of their higher tumor uptake in animal models compared to agonists. For characterization, development, and translation of a potential imaging pharmaceutical into the clinic, it must be evaluated in a series of tests, including in vitro cell binding assays, in vitro buffer and serum stability studies, the biodistribution of the radiolabeled material, and finally imaging studies in preclinical animal models. Data related to acetate buffer, mouse, canine, and human sera stability of 177Lu-labeled RM1 are presented here and compared with the acetate buffer and sera stability data of AMBA agonist. The samples of 177Lu-labeled RM1 with a high radioconcentration degrade faster than low-radioconcentration samples upon storage at 2-8 °C. Addition of stabilizers, ascorbic acid and gentisic acid, improve the stability of 177Lu-labeled RM1 significantly with gentisic acid being more efficient than ascorbic acid as a stabilizer. The degradation kinetics of 177Lu-labeled AMBA and RM1 in sera follow the order (fastest to slowest): mouse > canine > human sera. Finally, 177Lu-labeled RM1 antagonist is slower to degrade in mouse, canine, and human sera than 177Lu-labeled AMBA agonist, further suggesting that an antagonist is a more promising candidate than agonist for the positron emission tomography (PET) imaging and therapy of prostate cancer patients.""","""['Arijit Ghosh', 'Karen Woolum', 'Shankaran Kothandaraman', 'Michael F Tweedle', 'Krishan Kumar']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Molecules""","""['3-Cyano-4-18Ffluoro-benzoyl-Ala(SO3H)-Ala(SO3H)-Ava-Gln-Trp-Ala-Val-NMeGly-His-Sta-Leu-NH2.', 'Theranostic Perspectives in Prostate Cancer with the Gastrin-Releasing Peptide Receptor Antagonist NeoBOMB1: Preclinical and First Clinical Results.', '68Ga-DOTA-4-amino-1-carboxymethyl-piperidine-D-Phe-Gln-Trp-Ala-Val-Gly-His-Sta-Leu-NH2.', '111In-DOTA-4-amino-1-carboxymethyl-piperidine-D-Phe-Gln-Trp-Ala-Val-Gly-His-Sta-Leu-NH2.', 'Preclinical comparison of Al18F- and 68Ga-labeled gastrin-releasing peptide receptor antagonists for PET imaging of prostate cancer.', '68Ga-Labeled Thz14Bombesin(7-14) Analogs: Promising GRPR-Targeting Agonist PET Tracers with Low Pancreas Uptake.', 'Radiolysis-Associated Decrease in Radiochemical Purity of 177Lu-Radiopharmaceuticals and Comparison of the Effectiveness of Selected Quenchers against This Process.', 'Application of Phage-Displayed Peptides in Tumor Imaging Diagnosis and Targeting Therapy.', 'Gastric Corpus Mucosal Hyperplasia and Neuroendocrine Cell Hyperplasia, but not Spasmolytic Polypeptide-Expressing Metaplasia, Is Prevented by a Gastrin Receptor Antagonist in H+/K+ATPase Beta Subunit Knockout Mice.']"""

Developing research-based next-generation sequencing gene panels that not only target (present-day) clinically actionable susceptibility genes but also genes that currently lack sufficient evidence for risk as well as candidate genes, such as those in DNA repair pathways, can help aid this effort. Therefore, gene panel B.O.P. (Breast, Ovarian, and Prostate) was developed to evaluate the genetic risk of breast, ovarian and/or prostate cancer, and this manuscript serves as an introduction to B.O.P. and highlights its initial analytical validity assessment. B.O.P targets 87 genes that have been suggested, predicted, or clinically proven to be associated with breast, ovarian, and/or prostate cancer risk using Agilent Technologies Haloplex probes. The probes were designed for 100 base pair reads on an Illumina platform and target both coding and non-coding exons as well as 10 intronic base pairs flanking the intron-exon boundaries. The initial B.O.P screening involved 43 individuals from the Alabama Hereditary Cancer Cohort, and an average sequencing depth of 809X was obtained. Upon variant filtering and validation, true positives had an average sequencing depth of 659X and allele balance of 0.51. The average false positive sequencing depth was 34X and allele balance was 0.33. Although low sequencing depth was not always indicative of a false positive, high sequencing depths (>100X) signified a true positive. Furthermore, sensitivity and specificity of BRCA1/2 were calculated to be 100% and 92.3%, respectively. Overall, this screening enabled the establishment of criteria to alleviate future validation efforts and strongly supports the use of B.O.P. to further elucidate hereditary cancer susceptibility.

The aim of this study is to investigate the diagnostic value of serum expression level of miR-494 for prostate cancer.  Methods:   Ninety patients with prostate cancer and 90 patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia were enrolled in this study, and 90 healthy volunteers served as the control group. The serum of the participants was collected, and the expression level of miR-494 was measured by RT-PCR. Then the relationship between the expression of miR-494 and the clinical characteristics of the patients was analyzed. Moreover, the correlation between the expression of miR-494 and the Gleason score as well as serum level of prostate specific antigen (PSA) were analyzed. Finally, the diagnostic value of miR-494 for the early diagnosis of prostate cancer was analyzed by ROC curve.  Results:   miR-494 was significantly increased in the prostatic hyperplasia group compared with the control group, and the level of miR-494 in the prostate cancer group was significantly higher than that in the prostatic hyperplasia group. The level of miR-494 in patients with prostate cancer was positively correlated with tumor size and tumor stage.

Therefore, developing novel approaches to abrogate CAR T-cell-mediated side effects is of great relevance. Several promising strategies pursue the selective antibody-based depletion of adoptively transferred T cells via elimination markers. However, given the limited half-life and tissue penetration, dependence on the patients' immune system and on-target/off-side effects of proposed monoclonal antibodies, we sought to exploit αCAR-engineered T cells to efficiently eliminate CAR T cells. For comprehensive and specific recognition, a small peptide epitope (E-tag) was incorporated into the extracellular spacer region of CAR constructs. We provide first proof-of-concept for targeting this epitope by αE-tag CAR T cells, allowing an effective killing of autologous E-tagged CAR T cells both in vitro and in vivo whilst sparing cells lacking the E-tag. In addition to CAR T-cell cytotoxicity, the αE-tag-specific T cells can be empowered with cancer-fighting ability in case of relapse, hence, have versatile utility.

In this study, we combined radiotherapy with immune checkpoint inhibition (iRT) in a castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) preclinical model.  Methods:   Two Myc-CaP tumor grafts were established in each castrated FVB mouse. Anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 antibodies were given and one graft was irradiated 20 Gy in 2 fractions.  Results:   In CRPC, a significant increase in survival was found for radiation treatment combined with either anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 compared to monotherapy. The median survival for anti-PD-L1 alone was 13 days compared to 30 days for iRT (p = 0.0003), and for anti-PD-1 alone was 21 days compared to 36 days for iRT (p = 0.0009). Additional treatment with anti-CD8 antibody blocked the survival effect. An abscopal treatment effect was observed for iRT in which the unirradiated graft responded similarly to the irradiated graft in the same mouse. At 21 days, the mean graft volume for anti-PD-1 alone was 2094 mm3 compared to iRT irradiated grafts 726 mm3 (p = 0.04) and unirradiated grafts 343 mm3 (p = 0.0066). At 17 days, the mean graft volume for anti-PD-L1 alone was 1754 mm3 compared to iRT irradiated grafts 284 mm3 (p = 0.04) and unirradiated grafts 556 mm3 (p = 0.21). Flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry identified CD8+ immune cell populations altered by combination treatment in grafts harvested at the peak effect of immunotherapy, 2-3 weeks after starting treatment.  Conclusions:   These data provide preclinical evidence for the use of iRT targeting PD-1 and PD-L1 in the treatment of CRPC. Immune checkpoint inhibition combined with radiotherapy treats CPRC with significant increases in median survival compared to drug alone: 70% longer for anti-PD-1 and 130% for anti-PD-L1, and with an abscopal treatment effect.

This limits the number and variety of individuals who can participate. Telehealth is one approach that could be used to increase sample size and representativeness. The present analysis aims to evaluate the experience of individuals diagnosed with breast or prostate cancer, who participated by telehealth in studies investigating the effects of cancer treatment on sleep and cognition. Specifically, this study aimed to highlight potential benefits of using telehealth and identify ways to improve the process for future studies and assessments.  Methods:   Telephone interviews were conducted with 20 individuals with cancer who participated via telehealth in a larger study investigating the effects of cancer treatment on sleep and cognition; 12 individuals had breast cancer and 8 individuals had prostate cancer. Participants were organized into the four regional health authorities of Newfoundland and Labrador: Eastern, Western, Central, and Grenfell-Labrador. Participants of varying ages and communities were purposively selected. Participants were interviewed about their experience participating in the study via telehealth and invited to offer suggestions for how to improve the process. Interview transcripts were coded using a thematic analysis approach. Demographic information was used to characterize the sample.  Results:   Including telehealth as an option in the overall study allowed for a 55% sample size increase for participants with breast cancer, and a 45% sample size increase for participants with prostate cancer. Participants reported an overall positive experience (70% reported the experience as good and/or great), with telehealth allowing for greater convenience, more personable interactions, increased access, and an otherwise unavailable opportunity to help others and themselves. Identified areas for improvement were sound quality, and better access for those who still face barriers of commuting to telehealth locations. Inter-rater reliability yielded a 92% agreement.  Conclusions:   For studies and assessments requiring face-to-face contact, telehealth is clearly a feasible option for improving research representativeness and access for individuals residing in rural areas.

We analyzed the effect of TUBB3 knockdown on DTX and CBZ resistance and examined the interaction between TUBB3 and PTEN. We also investigated the role of phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3K) inhibitor (LY294002) in DTX and CBZ resistance. TUBB3 expression was upregulated in DTX-resistant and CBZ-resistant cells. TUBB3 knockdown re-sensitized DTX-resistant cells to DTX and CBZ-resistant cells to CBZ. Additionally, TUBB3 knockdown re-sensitized DTX-resistant cell lines to CBZ, indicating that TUBB3 mediates cross-resistance between DTX and CBZ. Knockdown of TUBB3 enhanced PTEN expression, and PTEN knockout enhanced TUBB3 expression. LY294002 suppressed TUBB3 expression in DTX-resistant and CBZ-resistant cell lines.

There are contrasting studies on the role of the SASP in cancer. Studies suggested that cancer cells may misuse the senescent secretome for their growth. Other investigations evidenced that the SASP may induce cancer growth arrest, senescence, or apoptosis. These conflicting data can be reconciled considering that cancer cells can coax senescent cells to secrete factors for their survival, thus abrogating the SASP's anti-cancer effect. Cancer stage may also have an impact on the capacity of the SASP to block tumor proliferation and promote senescence. Indeed, senescence is associated with a permanent cell cycle arrest, which needs functional cell cycle checkpoints. We evaluated the SASP effect on the in vitro biological properties of PNT2 and PC3 cells, which are immortalized prostate cells and metastatic prostatic cancer cells, respectively. We evidenced that SASPs, coming either from mesenchymal stromal cells treated with H202 or with low X-ray doses, induced senescence of immortalized cells but not of cancer cells.

Methods:   We identified 46 155 cases (of which 6998 were fatal) and 270 342 controls of White British ancestry from the UK Biobank cohort (UKB), based on ICD10 diagnoses. Individuals with benign tumours were excluded. Coffee intake was self-reported and recorded based on cup/day consumption. We conducted both observational and summary data MR analyses.  Results:   There was no observational association between coffee intake and overall cancer risk [odds ratio (OR) per one cup/day increase = 0.99, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.98, 1.00] or cancer death (OR = 1.01, 0.99, 1.03); the estimated OR from MR is 1.01 (0.94, 1.08) for overall cancer risk and 1.11 (0.95, 1.31) for cancer death. The relationship between coffee intake and individual cancer risks were consistent with a null effect, with most cancers showing little or no associations with coffee. Meta-analysis of our MR findings with publicly available summary data on various cancers do not support a strong causal relationship between coffee and risk of breast, ovarian, lung or prostate cancer, upon correction for multiple testing.  Conclusions:   Taken together, coffee intake is not associated with overall risk of being diagnosed with or dying from cancer in UKB. For individual cancers, our findings were not statistically inconsistent with earlier observational studies, although for these we were unable to rule out a small effect on specific types of cancer.""","""['Jue-Sheng Ong', 'Matthew H Law', 'Jiyuan An', 'Xikun Han', 'Puya Gharahkhani', 'David C Whiteman', 'Rachel E Neale', 'Stuart MacGregor']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Int J Epidemiol""","""['Coffee consumption and risk of breast cancer: A Mendelian randomization study.', 'Association between habitual coffee consumption and multiple disease outcomes: A Mendelian randomisation phenome-wide association study in the UK Biobank.', 'Instant Coffee Is Negatively Associated with Telomere Length: Finding from Observational and Mendelian Randomization Analyses of UK Biobank.', 'Causal relationship from coffee consumption to diseases and mortality: a review of observational and Mendelian randomization studies including cardiometabolic diseases, cancer, gallstones and other diseases.', 'Associations of Smoking and Alcohol and Coffee Intake with Fracture and Bone Mineral Density: A Mendelian Randomization Study.', 'Investigating the association between glycaemic traits and colorectal cancer in the Japanese population using Mendelian randomisation.', 'Associations of alcohol and coffee with colorectal cancer risk in East Asian populations: a Mendelian randomization study.', 'Coffee consumption and cancer risk: a Mendelian randomisation study.', 'Review of Mendelian Randomization Studies on Endometrial Cancer.', 'Association of alcohol types, coffee and tea intake with mortality: prospective cohort study of UK Biobank participants.']"""

However, available data are limited, and controversy remains regarding the best treatment approach for IBD patients who develop prostate cancer.  Methods:   A retrospective cohort study across 4 Department of Veterans Affairs hospital systems. Patients with established IBD who were diagnosed and treated for prostate cancer between 1996-2015 were included. We assessed for flares of IBD, IBD-related hospitalizations, and IBD-related surgeries within 6, 12, and 24 months of cancer diagnosis and survival at 1, 2, and 5 years. Flares of IBD were those documented as such by the treating physician, and treatment changed accordingly.  Results:   One hundred patients with IBD and prostate cancer were identified. Forty-seven were treated with either treatment with external beam radiation or brachytherapy, and 53 were treated with nonradiation modalities. Comparing cohorts with or without radiation treatment, there were no differences in baseline IBD characteristics, Charlson comorbidity index, or prostate cancer stage. Inflammatory bowel disease flares were 2-fold higher for radiation-treated patients within 6 months (10.6% vs 5.7%) and 6-12 months (4.3% vs 1.9%) after cancer diagnosis. On multiple logistic regression analysis, radiation treatment (adjusted odds ratio, 4.82; 95% confidence interval, 1.15-20.26) was a significant predictor of flares. However, rates of IBD-related hospitalizations or surgeries were not significantly different.  Conclusions:   In this retrospective, multicenter study, 2-fold higher rates of flare were found within the first year after prostate cancer diagnosis for patients treated with radiation, but there were no differences in IBD-related hospitalizations or surgeries. Although patients should be counseled of these risks, avoidance of radiation therapy in IBD patients with prostate cancer is likely not necessary.""","""['Linda A Feagins', 'Jaehyun Kim', 'Anchalia Chandrakumaran', 'Cassandra Gandle', 'Katrina H Naik', 'Daisha J Cipher', 'Jason K Hou', 'Michael D Yao', 'Jill K J Gaidos']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Inflamm Bowel Dis""","""['Stereotactic body radiation therapy for the treatment of localized prostate cancer in men with underlying inflammatory bowel disease.', 'Implications of Prostate Cancer Treatment in Men With Inflammatory Bowel Disease.', 'Short-term Toxicity of High Dose Rate Brachytherapy in Prostate Cancer Patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease.', 'Managing Patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease Who Develop Prostate Cancer.', 'Functional outcomes and complications following radiation therapy for prostate cancer: a critical analysis of the literature.', 'The Optimal Management of Inflammatory Bowel Disease in Patients with Cancer.', 'Inflammatory bowel disease-associated malignancies and considerations for radiation impacting bowel: a scoping review.', 'Toxicity After Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy for Prostate Cancer in Patients With Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A Multi-institutional Matched Case-Control Series.', 'Stereotactic body radiation therapy for the treatment of localized prostate cancer in men with underlying inflammatory bowel disease.', 'Utilization of Iodinated SpaceOAR Vue™ During Robotic Prostate Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy (SBRT) to Identify the Rectal-Prostate Interface and Spare the Rectum: A Case Report.']"""

Objective:   To assess the safety, efficacy, androgen signalling/metabolome, and drug-drug interactions (DDIs) of enzalutamide with abiraterone acetate in progressive bone mCRPC (bmCRPC).  Design, setting, and participants:   This open-label, single-centre interventional study was conducted in bmCRPC patients.  Intervention:   Enzalutamide 160mg and abiraterone acetate 1000mg once daily; prednisone 5mg twice daily.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Adverse events (AEs), prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response, progression-free survival (PFS), tumour biomarker/metabolite expression, and Cmin plasma concentrations were evaluated.  Results and limitations:   Sixty patients were enrolled. Common AEs independent of grade/causality included fatigue (72%), hyperglycaemia (67%), alkaline phosphatase (ALP) elevation (53%), and hot flush (43%). Grade 3 AEs included hypertension (17%), alanine aminotransferase elevation (12%), ALP elevation (5%), and arthralgia (5%). No treatment-related grade 4 AEs or deaths were reported. Median treatment-discontinuation time was 312d (95% confidence interval [CI] 196.0-483.0). Maximal PSA decline ≥50% and ≥90% occurred in 46 (77%) and 29 (48%) patients, respectively. Median PFS was 251d (95% CI 147-337). At week 9, median tumour microenvironment androgens, precursors, and nuclear AR expression decreased (p<0.001). The baseline tumour AR C/N terminal ratio of ≥80% was associated with treatment benefit. At enzalutamide steady state, abiraterone acetate Cmin was ∼23% lower (range 14.05-200.5ng/ml) than when given alone.  Conclusions:   Enzalutamide combined with abiraterone acetate has a manageable safety profile, without a meaningful DDI. Both agents are pharmacodynamically active with no feedback.

However, it is unclear how these tools should be used in concert.  Objective:   To develop a unified risk prediction model (S3M-MRI) that combines the Stockholm3 score (based on protein and genetic markers and clinical variables) and Prostate Imaging-Reporting and Data System v.2 scores modified for MRI without contrast (modPI-RADS).  Design, setting, and participants:   We used data for 532 men from the prospective multicentre STHLM3-MRI diagnostic study to construct S3M-MRI. We compared S3M-MRI to Stockholm3 and modPI-RADS alone with respect to model discrimination, calibration, and net benefit. We also compared clinical outcomes for five diagnostic strategies according to the use of combinations of the three models.  Results and limitations:   The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was 0.88 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.85-0.91) for S3M-MRI, which was significantly higher (p=0.04) than for Stockholm3 (0.86, 95% CI 0.83-0.89) and modPI-RADS (0.83, 95% CI 0.79-0.87). S3M-MRI had a higher net benefit on decision curve analysis for clinically relevant probability thresholds for biopsy recommendation in comparison to Stockholm3 and modPI-RADS. However, for different diagnostic strategies, sequential use of Stockholm3 followed by MRI only for Stockholm3-positive men resulted in a similar number of unnecessary biopsies (64 vs 69) and diagnosed International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) grade group 1 cancers (56 vs 51) at similar sensitivity for ISUP grade group ≥2 cancers, while avoiding 38% of MRI scans. Limitations include the ethnically homogeneous study population.  Conclusions:   The unified S3M-MRI model was superior to the Stockholm3 model and modPI-RADS alone. However, the S3M-MRI improvement was marginal compared to sequential use of Stockholm3 followed by MRI, and resulted in 60% more MRI scans.

Objective:   To evaluate CTCs as surrogate samples for genomic analyses in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC).  Design, setting, and participants:   Three isolation strategies (filter laser-capture microdissection, self-seeding microwell chips, and fluorescence-activated cell sorting) were developed to capture CTCs with various epithelial and mesenchymal phenotypes and isolate them at the single-cell level. Whole-genome amplification (WGA) and WGA quality control were performed on 179 CTC samples, matched metastasis biopsies, and negative controls from 11 patients. All patients but one were pretreated with enzalutamide or abiraterone. Whole-exome sequencing (WES) of 34 CTC samples, metastasis biopsies, and negative controls were performed for seven patients.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   WES of CTCs was rigorously qualified in terms of percentage coverage at 10× depth, allelic dropout, and uncovered regions. Shared somatic mutations between CTCs and matched metastasis biopsies were identified. A customized approach based on determination of mutation rates for CTC samples was developed for identification of CTC-exclusive mutations.  Results and limitations:   Shared mutations were mostly detected in epithelial CTCs and were recurrent. For two patients for whom a deeper analysis was performed, a few CTCs were sufficient to represent half to one-third of the mutations in the matched metastasis biopsy. CTC-exclusive mutations were identified in both epithelial and nonepithelial CTCs and affected cytoskeleton, invasion, DNA repair, and cancer-driver genes. Some 41% of CTC-exclusive mutations had a predicted deleterious impact on protein function. Phylogenic relationships between CTCs with distinct phenotypes were evidenced.  Conclusions:   CTCs can provide unique insight into metastasis mutational diversity and reveal undiagnosed genomic aberrations in matched metastasis biopsies.

We undertook a prospective trial of 177Lu-PSMA-617 radioligand therapy in men with high PSMA expression who progressed after standard therapies.  Objective:   To determine outcomes for men screened for the trial but not treated because of low PSMA expression.  Design, setting, and participants:   Patients screened with 68Ga-PSMA-11 and 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography/computed tomography in a prospective trial. Patients ineligible for enrolment with low PSMA expression or FDG-positive PSMA-negative (discordant FDG-avid) disease were assessed.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Subsequent treatments received were recorded. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to determine overall survival from date of screening.  Results and limitations:   Sixteen patients (24%) had low PSMA expression (n=8) or discordant FDG-avid disease (n=8). The median prostate-specific antigen doubling-time was 2.1mo. Eleven patients had Gleason ≥8 disease. All patients had previously progressed after docetaxel, 44% after cabazitaxel, and 94% after abiraterone and/or enzalutamide.

At San Raffaele Hospital, the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF-6) was used to ask new PC patients about function in both the previous 4wk and 6mo. We compared responses to these two timeframes. IIEF-6 scores were lower for the 4-wk period (median 24 vs 26; p<0.0001) predominately because approximately one in six of patients with good function in the 6-mo time frame had very poor function in the 4wk before completing the questionnaire (adequate erectile function 60% and 51%; absolute difference 9%, 95% confidence interval 8-10%). Results were further confirmed using a comparison group of 5395 patients with PC newly diagnosed at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center who had similar function in the previous 6mo. Erectile function evaluation for men presenting with PC should involve asking about typical function over a 6-mo period rather than focusing on the previous 4wk.

We conducted a retrospective analysis of a combined data set from these trials to identify a benefit in subsets of patients according to prognostic risk factors. The prognostic ability of factors to predict survival was evaluated using Cox proportional hazards regression models. Evaluation of potential beneficial subsets was performed using interaction terms between factors and cabozantinib. All tests were two-sided and p≤0.05 was considered statistically significant. A total of 1147 post-docetaxel patients with mCRPC were available (1028 from COMET-1 and 119 from COMET-2). The following factors were prognostic for OS: age, disease-free interval, hemoglobin, prostate-specific antigen, alkaline phosphatase, albumin, bone scan lesion area, lactate dehydrogenase, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status, and pain (all p<0.05). There was no interaction effect on survival between cabozantinib versus comparator arms and any prognostic group. After adjusting for prognostic factors, cabozantinib was associated with better OS (hazard ratio 0.80, 95% confidence interval 0.67-0.95; p=0.012). Further investigation of cabozantinib in a better-powered trial or a rational patient population based on a molecular biomarker may be warranted.

However, the role of lymph node dissection (LND) for such cases is unknown.  Objective:   To test the contemporary effect of LND at RP on cancer-specific mortality (CSM), overall mortality (OM), and early postoperative outcomes compared with no LND in mPCa patients.  Design, setting, and participants:   We identified surgically treated mPCa patients within the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Result (SEER) database (2004-2014) and the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) database (2004-2013).  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   In the SEER-based analyses, Kaplan-Meier plots and multivariable Cox regression models (CRMs) were used after inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) adjustment. In the NIS-based analyses, multivariable logistic regression (MLR) and multivariable Poisson regression (MPR) models were used after IPTW and adjustment for clustering.  Results and limitations:   Within the SEER database, 199 (60.3%) of 330 mPCa patients treated with RP underwent LND. After IPTW, multivariable CRMs showed lower CSM (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.52, confidence interval [CI]: 0.31-0.87; p=0.01) and OM (HR: 0.38, CI: 0.24-0.60; p<0.001) rates after LND at RP in patients. Within the NIS database, 1186 (71.3%) of 1663 mPCa patients treated with RP underwent LND. After IPTW, MLR models showed higher rates of transfusions (odds ratio [OR]: 1.54, CI: 1.03-2.30; p=0.03) after LND versus no LND. No difference was observed in overall complications (OR: 1.04, CI: 0.77-1.41, p=0.7). In MPR, LND at RP did not affect the length of stay (OR: 1.05, CI: 0.97-1.14, p=0.2).  Conclusions:   We are the first to demonstrate that LND at RP is associated with lower CSM and OM in the setting of mPCa, but not with higher rates of perioperative complications.

One such trial, ERA 223, has shown that the combination of abiraterone plus radium-223 did not improve symptomatic skeletal event-free survival compared with abiraterone plus placebo. Furthermore, an increase in bone fractures was observed with the combination of abiraterone and radium-223 in the study, particularly in patients not receiving bone health agents (denosumab or zoledronic acid). The results led to a change in the indication of radium-223 in Europe and also highlighted a need for greater awareness of bone health in patients with prostate cancer. Following a meeting to discuss these issues, we report in this article our views on the role of radium-223 within the emerging treatment options for patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. We discuss best practices, and provide expert recommendations for preserving bone health and sequencing of life-prolonging therapies in patients with prostate cancer in order to achieve optimal outcomes. PATIENT SUMMARY: We provide recommendations on maintaining bone health, sequencing of treatments, and the role of radium-223 therapy in prostate cancer. Radium-223 is a valuable treatment option for patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer and bone metastases. Monitoring and maintaining bone health are essential for patients with prostate cancer, and should be considered at the initiation of androgen deprivation therapy.""","""[""Joe M O'Sullivan"", 'Joan Carles', 'Richard Cathomas', 'Alfonso Gomez-Iturriaga', 'Daniel Heinrich', 'Gero Kramer', 'Piet Ost', 'Inge van Oort', 'Bertrand Tombal']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Eur Urol Oncol""","""['Addition of radium-223 to abiraterone acetate and prednisone or prednisolone in patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer and bone metastases (ERA 223): a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial.', 'Treating Patients with Metastatic Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer: A Comprehensive Review of Available Therapies.', 'Radium-223 and concomitant therapies in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer: an international, early access, open-label, single-arm phase 3b trial.', 'Bone Health and Bone-targeted Therapies for Prostate Cancer: a Programme in Evidence-based Care - Cancer Care Ontario Clinical Practice Guideline.', 'Radium-223 for the treatment of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) : The androgen receptor-independent active agent in the therapeutic sequence.', 'Clinical outcomes and treatment patterns in REASSURE: planned interim analysis of a real-world observational study of radium-223 in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Real-world effectiveness, long-term safety and treatment pathway integration of radium-223 therapy in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Real-world patient characteristics associated with survival of 2 years or more after radium-223 treatment for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (EPIX study).', 'Current and Emerging Therapies for Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer (mCRPC).', 'Evaluation of the reporting quality of clinical practice guidelines on prostate cancer using the RIGHT checklist.']"""

There are limited data on PTEN loss as detected by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and the risk of lethal disease after surgery.  Objective:   To determine whether PTEN loss as detected by quantitative fluorescence IHC (FIHC) predicts lethal disease outcomes after surgery for prostate cancer.  Design, setting and participants:   We used formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded radical prostatectomy specimens to construct tissue microarrays and perform dual FIHC for PTEN and AMACR for masking tumor epithelium, plus semi-quantitative multispectral imaging analysis.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   The association of PTEN status analyzed continuously and dichotomously (low [expression in the lowest quartile] vs higher [expression >lowest quartile]) with disease outcomes (metastasis and death) was assessed with adjustment for age, Gleason score, and stage in multivariable analyses. The prognostic ability of PTEN was assessed using logistic regression models.  Results and limitations:   Low PTEN expression was associated with a higher risk of metastatic disease as both a continuous (hazard ratio [HR] 1.49, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.14-1.92; p<0.003) and dichotomous (HR 1.92, 95% CI 1.02-3.63; p=0.04) variable.

Addition of PTEN status to clinicopathologic factors (age, Gleason score, and stage) incrementally improved a prognostic model assessing 10-yr outcomes for metastatic disease (area under the curve [AUC] 0.76 vs 0.80) and death (AUC 0.70 vs 0.75).  Conclusions:   Low PTEN expression detected by FIHC in primary prostate cancer is an independent prognostic biomarker for metastatic disease and death after definitive therapy. FIHC for PTEN is a viable clinical diagnostic assay in this context.  Patient summary:   We looked at loss of the PTEN protein in prostate tumors from men treated with surgery.

Objective:   To perform a cost-effectiveness analysis of immediate docetaxel or abiraterone acetate treatment in addition to ADT in men with metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (PC).  Design, setting, and participants:   We developed a state-transition model to simulate the natural progression of metastatic PC. Model parameters were derived from the published literature and through calibration to observed epidemiological data. Following diagnosis, a hypothetical cohort of men with metastatic hormone-sensitive PC could be treated with docetaxel+ADT, abiraterone+ADT, or ADT alone. Once disease progresses to castration-resistant PC, treatment with one of the approved therapies in this setting was initiated.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   The outcomes measured were quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and costs from a US private payer, health sector perspective.  Results and limitations:   Compared to treatment with ADT alone, docetaxel and abiraterone resulted in a discounted quality-adjusted survival gain of 3.6 and 22.0mo, respectively. Using standard cost-effectiveness metrics, treatment with docetaxel and ADT provides high value for money (ie, is cost effective) with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $34723, compared to an ICER of $295212 for abiraterone. The monthly cost of abiraterone would have to be less than $3114 for it to be cost effective.  Conclusions:   Docetaxel+ADT is likely the most cost-effective treatment option for men with metastatic hormone-sensitive PC. Although potentially more effective than docetaxel, the costs of abiraterone would have to be considerably lower to match the cost effectiveness of docetaxel+ADT.  Patient summary:   This study evaluated the balance of costs and benefits for treatment of metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer with docetaxel plus androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), abiraterone plus ADT, or ADT alone. We found that treatment with docetaxel plus ADT likely represents the most cost-effective option in this setting.""","""['Niranjan J Sathianathen', 'Fernando Alarid-Escudero', 'Karen M Kuntz', 'Nathan Lawrentschuk', 'Damien M Bolton', 'Declan G Murphy', 'Simon P Kim', 'Badrinath R Konety']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Eur Urol Oncol""","""['Cost-Effectiveness of Systemic Treatments for Metastatic Castration-Sensitive Prostate Cancer: An Economic Evaluation Based on Network Meta-Analysis.', 'Abiraterone acetate in combination with androgen deprivation therapy compared to androgen deprivation therapy only for metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer.', ""Cost-effectiveness analysis of Abiraterone Acetate versus Docetaxel in the management of metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer: Hong Kong's perspective."", 'Abiraterone acetate/androgen deprivation therapy combination versus docetaxel/androgen deprivation therapy combination in advanced hormone-sensitive prostate cancer: a network meta-analysis on safety and efficacy.', 'Cabazitaxel for Hormone-Relapsed Metastatic Prostate Cancer Previously Treated With a Docetaxel-Containing Regimen: An Evidence Review Group Perspective of a NICE Single Technology Appraisal.', 'Survival modelling and cost-effectiveness analysis of treatments for newly diagnosed metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer.', 'Cost-utility analysis of adding abiraterone acetate plus prednisone/prednisolone to long-term hormone therapy in newly diagnosed advanced prostate cancer in England: Lifetime decision model based on STAMPEDE trial data.', 'The Health Economics of Metastatic Hormone-Sensitive and Non-Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer-A Systematic Literature Review with Application to the Canadian Context.', 'Cost-Effectiveness of Systemic Treatments for Metastatic Castration-Sensitive Prostate Cancer: An Economic Evaluation Based on Network Meta-Analysis.', 'Current treatment options for newly diagnosed metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer-a narrative review.']"""

Objective:   To determine the prognostic role of the Decipher genomic classifier in two high-risk PC case-control studies.  Design, setting, and participants:   Patients who developed distant metastases after surgery for high-risk, nonmetastatic PC in a European tertiary referral center from 1991 to 2011 were matched to patients not developing distant metastases (n=54). A validation study (n=298) was performed using a similar US case-control cohort. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue blocks from the index PC lesion were used for RNA extraction and gene expression analysis.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   The outcome investigated was the development of distant metastasis within 10-yr follow-up. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed, with statistical significance considered at p<0.05.  Results and limitations:   In both the European and US case-control studies, the median Decipher scores were higher in the population that developed metastases. In the multivariable analysis, each 10% increase in Decipher score translated to an increase in the risk of distant metastases within 10-yr follow-up, with an odds ratio of 1.53 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.06-2.22; p=0.025) and 1.58 (95% CI 1.31-1.92; p<0.001) for the European and US cohorts, respectively. Median follow-up for the European cohort was 12yr (interquartile range 8-12). The study limitation is the small size of the European cohort.  Conclusions:   Our study validates Decipher as a predictor for metastatic recurrence even in patients with high-risk, nonmetastatic PC within 10-yr follow-up.  Patient summary:   Decipher is a test based on gene expression profiles in primary tumors in prostate cancer.

Objective:   To identify who benefits from mpMRI according to biopsy scenario (initial biopsy [IBx] vs repeated biopsy [RBx]) and the risk of aggressive PC according to PSA-DRE groups (G1, PSA <10ng/ml and -DRE; G2, PSA <10ng/ml and +DRE; G3, PSA ≥10ng/ml and -DRE; G4, PSA ≥10ng/ml and +DRE).  Design, setting, and participants:   We carried out a retrospective analysis for 768 consecutive men with PC suspicion and scheduled for PBx in a referral institution in 2016 and 2017.  Intervention:   Pelvic 3-T mpMRI scanning, targeted biopsy (TBx) for suspicious lesions (Prostate Imaging-Reporting and Data System [PI-RADS] score >1), and 12-core systematic biopsy (SBx).  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   We measured the rate of PBx procedures that could be avoided and the rate of high-grade PC (HGPC) that would be missed among men with negative mpMRI, and the increase in HGPC detection due to TBx. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed.  Results and limitations:   The rate of avoidable biopsies (PI-RADS <3) was 24.2% overall, with 25.7% for IBx and 20.5% for RBx (p=0.057). The IBx and RBx rates were 31.2% and 19.8% in G1, 13.5% and 30.4% in G2, 23.7% and 21.9% in G3, and 2.5% and 0% in G4, respectively. The overall rate of missed HGPC was 1.0% for IBx and 6.5% for RBx (p=0.170), while the IBx and RBx rates were 1.1% and 5.2% for G1, 2.0% and 11.1% for G2, 0% and 7.7% for G3, and 0% and 0% for G4, respectively (p<0.001). The rate of HGPC (PI-RADS 3-5) diagnosed following TBx increased to 23.9% for IBx and to 32.6% for RBx overall (p<0.001), while the IBx and RBx rates were 29.0% and 45.5% for G1, 20.0% and 33.3% for G2, 40.0% and 38.9% for G3, and 0% and 0% for G4, respectively (p<0.001). Limitations are the single-institution design, the lack of randomisation, and small samples for subgroup analyses.  Conclusions:   mpMRI was of no benefit for men with PSA ≥10ng/ml and +DRE. Among the other men, mpMRI was of benefit in IBx and RBx as would reduce the biopsy rate by up to 25.7% and increase the net HGPC detection rate by up to 28.4%.

Design, setting, and participants:   Within the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database (2010-2014), we identified patients with newly diagnosed PCa and available clinical tumor stage, prostatic-specific antigen value (PSA), and Gleason grade group (GGG), and with or without metastases.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   We relied on PSA, clinical tumor stages, and GGG to discriminate between M1 and M0 patients. Patients were randomly divided according to the registry of origin between development (n=102469) and validation (n=98755) cohorts. Logistic regression modeling coefficients were used to devise a lookup table to discriminate between M0 and M1 stages. Receiver operating characteristic-derived area under the curve was tested for model accuracy, within the validation cohort. A total of 2000 bootstrap resamples were applied to 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Decision curve analysis (DCA) and calibration plots were used to test the performance of the lookup table.  Results and limitations:   Of 201224 patients, 3.5% harbored metastatic PCa (mPCa). PSA >40ng/ml, GGG5, and GGG4, in that order, represented the strongest predictors of mPCa. Overall, PSA, clinical tumor stage, and GGG were 94.3% (95% CI: 94.2-94.3%) accurate in predicting the probability of mPCa, in the external validation cohort. Up to 39.4% probability of mPCa, the model demonstrated accurate predictions in the calibration plot. In DCA, a net benefit was recorded up to a threshold probability of approximately 54%.  Conclusions:   The proposed lookup table for the prediction of the probability of mPCa may represent a useful clinical tool based on its high accuracy, excellent calibration, and robust nature of predictions.  Patient summary:   Our study provides a highly accurate lookup table for the prediction of the probability of metastatic prostate cancer patients.

Objective:   To identify patients who can avoid TRUS-Bx at the time of mpMRI targeted biopsy (MRI-TBx) relying on individual patient probability to harbour clinically significant prostate cancer (csPCa) outside the index lesion (IL).  Design, setting, and participants:   A total of 339 European and 441 North American patients underwent fusion MRI-TBx and concomitant TRUS-Bx at two tertiary care referral centres between 2013 and 2017.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   The study outcome was csPCa, defined as a Gleason score at biopsy of ≥7, outside the IL. Multivariable logistic regression analyses (MVAs) were performed to develop a predictive model for the study outcome. Multivariable-derived coefficients were used to develop a novel risk calculator in each cohort. The models were evaluated using the area under the curve (AUC), calibration plot, and decision-curve analyses.  Results and limitations:   In the European cohort, csPCa detection rate was 55%. The csPCa detection rate for TRUS-Bx was 41%. At MVAs, prostate volume, previous negative biopsy, and Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System versions 4 and 5 were independent predictors for the presence of csPCa outside the IL. The multivariable model had an AUC of 0.78. Omitting TRUS-Bx in patients with a calculated risk of <15% would have spared 16% of TRUS-Bx at the cost of missing 7% of csPCa. Similar findings were obtained when the same analyses were performed in the North American cohort. No net benefit was observed for low-threshold probabilities (<15%) of the each model relative to the standard of care (performing TRUS-Bx in addition to MRI-TBx to all patients) in both cohorts. The study is limited by its retrospective design.  Conclusions:   We failed to identify those patients who might safely benefit from MRI-TBx alone. The combination of MRI-TBx and TRUS-Bx should strongly be considered the best available approach.

Objective:   To identify PSM features associated with recurrence in a stage-by-stage analysis.  Design, setting, and participants:   A total of 1757 PCa patients treated with RP without neoadjuvant or adjuvant treatments between 2011 and 2017 were identified. Patients were stratified according to the presence of PSM and to margins characteristics in three groups: no versus favourable (single margin <3mm) versus unfavourable (≥3mm or multifocal margin) PSMs.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Predictors of biochemical recurrence (BCR) and clinical recurrence (CR) were assessed using semiparametric Cox proportional hazard models.  Results and limitations:   Overall, 285 (16%) patients had PSMs; 146 (51%) had a unifocal PSM, while 139 (49%) had a multifocal PSM. The median length of a PSM was 1mm.

However, less is known about the protocol adherence and outcomes for AS in real-world practice.  Objective:   To evaluate Prostate Cancer Research International Active Surveillance (PRIAS) protocol adherence in a real-world cohort and to relate follow-up intensity to oncological safety.  Design, setting, and participants:   Patients with biopsy-detected PC diagnosed from 2008 to 2014 treated with AS at six teaching hospitals in The Netherlands.  Intervention:   AS included regular prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing (every 3-6mo) combined with a confirmatory biopsy 1yr after diagnosis and every 3yr thereafter.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   The proportions of patients complying with the PRIAS biopsy and PSA monitoring protocol were determined. We assessed if PRIAS-discordant follow-up was associated with a higher risk of metastasis compared with PRIAS-concordant follow-up using Cox regression analysis. Analysis was performed for separate risk groups (PRIAS-eligible and PRIAS-ineligible) on the basis of the PRIAS inclusion criteria.  Results and limitations:   Of all patients on AS for >6mo, 706/958 (74%) had PRIAS-concordant PSA monitoring. Overall concordant follow-up (PSA and repeat biopsy) was observed in 415/958 patients (43%). The percentage of patients with overall concordant follow-up varied between hospitals (range 34-60%; p<0.001). Among PRIAS-ineligible patients, PRIAS-discordant PSA monitoring was associated with a higher risk of developing PC metastases during AS compared with patients with concordant follow-up (hazard ratio 5.25, 95% confidence interval 1.02-27.1). In the PRIAS-eligible population, we found no significant differences regarding rates of metastases between patients with discordant and concordant follow-up.  Conclusions:   We observed substantial variation in AS follow-up intensity between large urological practices in the Netherlands. Overall, 43% of patients on AS in daily clinical practice receive PRIAS-concordant follow-up. Noncompliance with the PRIAS follow-up protocol was associated with a higher rate of metastasis among PRIAS-ineligible patients, indicating that strict protocol adherence is important when these patients opt for AS.  Patient summary:   Fewer than half of patients with prostate cancer on active surveillance are monitored according to the follow-up protocol of the largest ongoing active surveillance study.

Objective:   To report a multicentre series of image-fusion transperineal prostate biopsies and compare the diagnostic yield of clinically significant PC (csPC) between targeted and nontargeted biopsies.  Design, setting, and participants:   The study included 640 consecutive patients with elevated prostate specific antigen (PSA) presenting for first biopsy or following a previous negative transrectal biopsy under the care of 13 urologists in 11 centres in the UK (April 2014-June 2017).  Intervention:   Multiparametric MRI was carried out in 61 approved prostate MRI centres with transperineal targeted alone (n=283) or targeted plus nontargeted (n=357) transperineal rigid image-fusion targeted biopsy (MIM-Symphony-DX).  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Rates of csPC and insignificant cancer detection in targeted and nontargeted biopsies were measured using a number of thresholds to define clinical significance. The primary definition was Gleason≥4+3 or any grade ≥6mm.  Results and limitations:   The mean age, median PSA, and median prostate volume for the cohort were 63.8yr (standard deviation [SD] 8.4), 6.3 ng/ml (SD 5.8), and 42.0cm3 (SD 24.7), respectively. Overall, 276/640 men (43.1%) were diagnosed with csPC. csPC was detected from targeted biopsies alone in 263/640 cases (41.1%). Of the 357 men who underwent nontargeted biopsies, three (0.8%) had csPC exclusively in nontargeted cores, with no evidence of cancer in targeted cores. Overall, 32/357 (9.0%) had csPC in nontargeted biopsies regardless of the targeted biopsy findings. Clinically insignificant disease in nontargeted biopsies was detected in 93/357 men (26.1%). Our findings were consistent across all other thresholds of clinical significance. Limitations include the lack of nontargeted biopsies in all men.  Conclusions:   In this large multicentre series, nontargeted prostate biopsy cores had a low yield of csPC and a high yield of clinically insignificant PC. An image-fusion targeted-biopsy-only approach maintains high detection for csPC and low detection of clinically insignificant cancers.

Objective:   To investigate long-term outcomes for men after an initial benign prostate biopsy.  Design, setting, and participants:   All men with a benign biopsy in the first screening round of the Göteborg prostate cancer (PC) screening trial were included. The follow-up period was January 1, 1995-May 15, 2017.  Intervention:   Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) tests were performed every second year (upper median age limit 69yr). Men with PSA ≥3ng/ml underwent prostate biopsy (sextant biopsy up to 2009).  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   The 20-yr cumulative PC incidence and PC mortality were calculated using the 1 minus Kaplan-Meier method.  Results and limitations:   Of 452 men with a benign biopsy and followed for a median of 21.1yr, 169 were diagnosed with PC and five died from PC. The 20-yr cumulative PC incidence and PC mortality were 40.0% and 1.4%, respectively. The corresponding figures were 38.8% and 0.6% for men with initial PSA ≤10ng/ml, and 64.4% and 21.4% for PSA >10ng/ml. The proportion of men untreated at final follow-up was similar in the two PSA groups (22% vs 23%). The use of sextant biopsy for many years of the trial is a limitation.  Conclusions:   Men with an initial benign prostate biopsy run a very low risk of dying from PC when participating in a screening program. However, if followed for a long period, many men will be diagnosed and treated for PC. Low-intensity follow-up, as in the Göteborg trial, appears sufficient for men with PSA ≤10ng/ml after a benign biopsy.

Objective:   To document differences in patient-reported outcomes (PROs) following radical prostatectomy (RP), external beam radiotherapy (EBRT), brachytherapy (BT), and active surveillance (AS), and to evaluate how these PROs and other factors are associated with treatment decision regret.  Design, setting, and participants:   A prospective, observational, multicentre study of men diagnosed with LPC (stage cT1-2) during 2014-2016.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Patients completed validated PRO measures (Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30 [QLQ-C30], Quality of Life Questionnaire prostate cancer-specific module [QLQ-PR25], Decision Regret Scale, and the Memorial Anxiety Scale for Prostate Cancer) before treatment and at 3, 6, and 12mo after treatment. Mixed-effect models were used to describe different PRO patterns.  Results and limitations:   The analytic cohort included 434 men (AS=32%; RP=45%; EBRT=12%; BT=10%). Follow-up response rates were above 90%. At 1-yr follow-up, (1) men who had received RP reported significantly (p<0.01) more urinary incontinence, sexual dysfunction, hormonal/masculinity-related symptoms, and less emotional distress; (2) those having received EBRT reported more sexual dysfunction, hormonal/masculinity-related symptoms, and physical distress; and (3) those having received BT reported more urinary obstruction and irritation symptoms, compared with patients under AS. Irrespective of the treatment modality, 23% of the patients reported clinically relevant treatment regret (99% confidence interval, 17-28%). Multivariate correlates of decision regret were hormonal/masculinity-related symptoms, educational level, and positive surgical margins.  Conclusions:   Post-treatment physical and psychosocial functioning was significantly associated with specific treatment modalities and pretreatment functioning. Regret was relatively frequently reported by patients who experienced unwanted physical, psychosocial, and oncological outcomes. Greater efforts should be made to understand whether carefully educating patients about the possible consequences and effectiveness of treatments may help limit the feeling of treatment regret.

We evaluated the trend for conservative management (ie, no active treatment within 12mo of diagnosis) for LRPC in an Australian population-based cohort of men captured in the Prostate Cancer Outcomes Registry Victoria (PCOR-Vic). Of the 3201 men diagnosed with LRPC between January 2009 and December 2016, 60% (1928/3201) had conservative management, and 52% (1664/3201) were documented to be on AS. There was an increase in conservative management from 52% in 2009 to 73% in 2016 (p<0.001), largely attributable to an increase in AS from 33% in 2009 to 67% in 2016 (p<0.001). When stratified by age group, the increase in conservative management was more pronounced among younger patients: from 37% to 66% for men aged <60yr versus from 72% to 86% for men aged ≥70yr. In multivariable analyses, increasing age, lower prostate-specific antigen and clinical category, lower socioeconomic status, and being diagnosed in public metropolitan institutions were all independently associated with a greater likelihood of conservative management. Identification of sociodemographic and institutional variations in practice allows for targeted strategies to improve management for men with LRPC. PATIENT SUMMARY: We looked at the uptake of conservative management (no active treatment within 12 mo of diagnosis) over time in an Australian population-based cohort of men with low-risk prostate cancer.

Objective:   In this study, we assess the role of NLR as a predictive biomarker through a retrospective analysis of the pivotal COU302 study of abiraterone acetate (AA) as first-line therapy for men with asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic mCRPC.  Design, setting, and participants:   The COU302 study randomized asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic men with mCRPC to receive AA plus prednisone or prednisone as first-line treatment. Baseline NLR, overall survival, radiographic progression-free survival, and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) progression-free survival were evaluated.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Descriptive statistics, as well as Kaplan-Meier and Cox survival models were used to assess the effect of baseline NLR and changes in NLR on response to AA plus prednisone versus prednisone, with adjustment for important covariates.  Results and limitations:   Among the 1082 patients who received treatment, baseline NLR values showed no significant differences according to baseline covariates except for albumin. Baseline variables were similar between dichotomous groups with an NLR cutoff of 2.5, except for a lower proportion of patients with >10 bone metastases in the NLR <2.5 group. Our survival results demonstrate that higher NLR values corresponded to poorer overall survival and PSA response to AA but not to placebo, which was confirmed in our adjusted regression models. No significant differences were seen in time to radiographic progression. In separate analyses, an increase or decrease in NLR by 2 from treatment baseline did not clearly signal subsequent lack of benefit with continued AA.  Conclusions:   Our results suggest that baseline NLR may be able to predict response to AA in men with asymptomatic mCRPC but that changes in NLR during treatment are insufficient to guide treatment. Further validation studies are warranted.  Patient summary:   In this report, we look at the ratio of circulating immune cells as a predictor of response to abiraterone acetate (AA), using data from a large trial. Our results suggest that this ratio derived from routinely obtained bloodwork can predict which patients respond better to AA.""","""['Thomas Loubersac', 'Molière Nguile-Makao', 'Frédéric Pouliot', 'Vincent Fradet', 'Paul Toren']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Eur Urol Oncol""","""['Re: Thomas Loubersac, Molière Nguile-Makao, Frédéric Pouliot, Vincent Fradet, Paul Toren.

Although almost a decade has passed since its approval for the treatment of asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), there remains a paucity of literature describing safety data in the postmarketing period.  Objective:   To describe the postmarketing safety experience for sipuleucel-T.  Design, setting, and participants:   In this case series study, US reports for sipuleucel-T submitted to the FDA's Adverse Event Reporting System were searched and reviewed between April 29, 2010, and December 31, 2017. This system is a spontaneous safety surveillance database for drug and therapeutic biologic products. The analysis of 3216 reports and select case reviews were undertaken between February and November 2018.  Main outcomes and measures:   Descriptive statistics were used to assess adverse event reports for sipuleucel-T. Empirical Bayes Geometric Means (EBGM) and their 90% confidence intervals (CIs) were computed to identify disproportionate (ie, at least twice the expected) reporting of sipuleucel-T-event pairs. Selected adverse events and death reports were individually reviewed.  Results:   In total, 3216 reports were identified for sipuleucel-T, of which 2014 (62.6%) were serious. For all included reports, the patients' median (interquartile range) age was 73 (67-79) years, and 3149 were specified to be males. Chills (n = 318), malaise (n = 196), pyrexia (n = 189), culture positive (n = 184), fatigue (n = 180), and nausea (n = 173) were among the most commonly reported adverse events. Infusion-related reactions (EBGM, 12.1; 90% CI, 9.4-15.3), infections, vascular events, and transient ischemic attacks (EBGM, 2.9; 90% CI, 2.2-3.9) were reported disproportionately. Among 249 deaths for which relevant dates were available, 128 (51.4%) were reported within 30 days of a sipuleucel-T infusion, of which 81.2% included a specified cause of death; of these 104 deaths, there were 37 neoplasms (35.6%), 25 cardiac disorders (24.0%), 18 nervous system disorders (17.3%), and 9 infections (8.7%).  Conclusions and relevance:   Reported adverse events were generally consistent with the safety experience observed in prelicensure studies and described in the sipuleucel-T package insert. Off-label use among overtly symptomatic men with CRPC, reporting bias, or lack of product effectiveness may have influenced the reporting of deaths within 30 days of treatment initiation. With this overview of sipuleucel-T experience, the present study serves as a resource for health care professionals and patients as they weigh the risks and benefits of treatment in the context of all available therapeutic options for CRPC.""","""['Graça M Dores', 'Marthe Bryant-Genevier', 'Silvia Perez-Vilar']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""JAMA Netw Open""","""['Postmarketing Analysis of Sipuleucel-T-The Importance of Real-World Data.', 'Surveillance for safety after immunization: Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS)--United States, 1991-2001.', 'Sipuleucel-T: in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Reporting of Death in US Food and Drug Administration Medical Device Adverse Event Reports in Categories Other Than Death.', 'Sipuleucel-T (Provenge) autologous vaccine approved for treatment of men with asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic castrate-resistant metastatic prostate cancer.', 'Activated lymphocyte recruitment into the tumor microenvironment following preoperative sipuleucel-T for localized prostate cancer.', 'Acute Kidney Injury in Cancer Immunotherapy Recipients.', 'Current progress in the development of prophylactic and therapeutic vaccines.', 'Adverse Renal Effects of Anticancer Immunotherapy: A Review.', 'Dendritic cell-based vaccine prolongs survival and time to next therapy independently of the vaccine cell number.', 'Cancer Immunotherapies: What the Perioperative Physician Needs to Know.']"""

More than 50% of the existing drugs target PM proteins. In the wake of emerging data indicating a key role of estrogens in prostate cancer (PCa) pathogenesis, the study was undertaken to explore whether the estrogen binding sites exist on the PM and if such sites are functionally relevant in PCa. Estradiol (E2) binding to the PM was detected in androgen-dependent (LNCaP), androgen-independent (PC3, DU145) PCa cell lines, nontumorigenic (RWPE1) prostate epithelial cell line, and rat prostate cells. Conventional estrogen receptors (nuclear estrogen receptors), known for their nuclear localization, were detected in the PM enriched extracts. This was indirectly confirmed by reduced localization of ERs on the PM of cells, silenced for the expression of their cognate genes. Further, unlike cell-permeable E2, stimulation with cell-impermeable estradiol (E2-BSA) did not induce proliferation in LNCaP cells. However, stimulation with E2-BSA led to alterations in the phosphorylation status of several kinases including GSK3 and AKT, along with the hyperphosphorylation of cytoskeletal proteins such as β-actin and cytokeratin 8 in LNCaP. This was accompanied by epithelial-to-mesenchymal (EMT) features such as increased migration and invasion; higher vimentin expression, and a concomitant decrease in the E-cadherin expression. These effects were not observed in RWPE1 cells. Interestingly, cell-permeable E2 failed to induce EMT in PCa cells. This in vitro study is the first to suggest that the PM-initiated estrogen signaling contributes to higher invasiveness in PCa cells. Plasma membrane ERs may act as novel targets for PCa therapeutics.""","""['Sushama Gadkar', 'Shardool Nair', 'Smita Patil', 'Shilpa Kalamani', 'Atmaram Bandivdekar', 'Vainav Patel', 'Uddhav Chaudhari', 'Geetanjali Sachdeva']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Mol Carcinog""","""['Hypoxia regulates ANXA1 expression to support prostate cancer cell invasion and aggressiveness.', 'Down-regulation of E-cadherin enhances prostate cancer chemoresistance via Notch signaling.', 'Androgen receptor as a regulator of ZEB2 expression and its implications in epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in prostate cancer.', 'Estrogen and prostate cancer: an eclipsed truth in an androgen-dominated scenario.', 'Role of stroma in carcinogenesis of the prostate.', 'Cell Plasticity and Prostate Cancer: The Role of Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition in Tumor Progression, Invasion, Metastasis and Cancer Therapy Resistance.']"""

This effect has been associated with the degradation products of glucosinolates-thioglycosides that accumulate within crucifers. The possible role of S-methyl cysteine sulfoxide, a metabolite that also accumulates in cruciferous vegetables, and its derivatives, in cancer prevention is relatively unexplored compared to glucosinolate derivatives. The hypothesis that consuming a broccoli soup results in the accumulation of sulfate (a SMCSO derivative) and other broccoli-derived metabolites in prostate tissue is tested.  Methods and results:   Eighteen men scheduled for transperineal prostate biopsy were recruited into a 4-week parallel single blinded diet supplementation study (NCT02821728). Nine men supplemented their diet with three 300 mL portions of a broccoli soup each week for four weeks prior to surgery. Analyses of prostate biopsy tissues reveal no detectable levels of glucosinolates and derivatives. In contrast, SMCSO is detected in prostate tissues of the participants, with significantly higher levels in tissue of men in the supplementation arm.

By analyzing the Gene Expression Omnibus dataset, we found lower expression for miR-488 in PCa than in normal tissues. Moreover, CCK-8, EdU, glucose uptake, and lactate secrete assays revealed that overexpression of miR-488 in PCa cell lines PC3 and DU145 resulted in inhibition of proliferation and glycolysis. In contrast, downregulation of miR-488 expression promoted proliferation and glycolysis in PCa cells. Using a bioinformatic approach and dual-luciferase reporter assays, we identified 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase, isoform3 (PFKFB3), as a direct target of miR-488.

However, the specific role of HMGB1 in tumor development and progression remains largely unknown. In this study, we investigated the molecular mechanisms of HMGB1 in PCa tumorigenesis. Methods: Gain-of-function and loss-of-function experiments were used to determine the biological functions of HMGB1 both in vitro and in vivo. Bioinformatic analysis, immunoprecipitation, and immunofluorescence assays were applied to discern and examine the relationship between HMGB1 and its potential targets. Specimens from 64 patients with PCa were analyzed for the expression of HMGB1 and its relationship with Brahma-related gene 1 (BRG1) was examined by immunohistochemistry. Results: The results demonstrated that ectopic expression of HMGB1 facilitated growth and metastasis of PCa by enhancing Akt signaling pathway and promoting epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), while silencing of HMGB1 showed the opposite effects. Mechanistically, HMGB1 exerted these functions through its interaction with BRG1 which may augment BRG1 function and activate the Akt signaling pathway thereby promoting EMT. Importantly, both HMGB1 and BRG1 expression was markedly increased in human PCa tissues. Conclusions: Taken together, these findings indicate that upregulation of HMGB1 promotes PCa development via activation of Akt and accelerates metastasis through regulating BRG1-mediated EMT.

Methods: Analysis of EZH2 ChIP-seq and ChIP-on-chip data in various cell types was performed.

Immunohistochemistry was employed to assess the correlation between EZH2 and FOXO1 protein expression in prostate cancer patient specimens. In vitro MTS (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium) and animal experiments were performed to determine the anti-cancer efficacy of EZH2 inhibitor alone or in combination of docetaxel, a chemotherapy agent of the taxane family, and dependency of the efficacy on FOXO1 expression. Results: We demonstrated that EZH2 binds to the FOXO1 gene promoter. EZH2 represses FOXO1 gene expression at the transcriptional level. EZH2 protein level inversely correlated with FOXO1 protein expression in prostate cancer patient specimens. This repression requires the methyltransferase activity and the functional PRC2 complex. While effectively inducing loss of viability of PTEN-positive 22Rv1 prostate cancer cells, EZH2 inhibitor failed to inhibit growth of PTEN-negative C4-2 prostate cancer cells. Co-treatment with docetaxel overcame EZH2 inhibitor resistance in PTEN-negative cancer cells in vitro and in mice. This effect was largely mediated by docetaxel-induced nuclear localization and activation of FOXO1. Conclusions: This study identifies FOXO1 as a bona fide repression target of EZH2 and an essential mediator of EZH2 inhibition-induced cell death. Our findings suggest that EZH2 repression of FOXO1 can be targeted by EZH2 inhibitor as a monotherapy for PTEN-proficient cancers or in combination with taxane for treatment of cancers with PTEN mutation or deletion.""","""['Linlin Ma', 'Yuqian Yan', 'Yang Bai', 'Yinhui Yang', 'Yunqian Pan', 'Xiaokun Gang', 'R Jeffrey Karnes', 'Jun Zhang', 'Qiubo Lv', 'Qiang Wu', 'Haojie Huang']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Theranostics""","""['Inhibition of the androgen receptor as a novel mechanism of taxol chemotherapy in prostate cancer.', 'SKP2 loss destabilizes EZH2 by promoting TRAF6-mediated ubiquitination to suppress prostate cancer.', 'MiR-222 promotes drug-resistance of breast cancer cells to adriamycin via modulation of PTEN/Akt/FOXO1 pathway.', 'Structural assembly of Polycomb group protein and Insight of EZH2 in cancer progression: A review.', 'Interplay Among PI3K/AKT, PTEN/FOXO and AR Signaling in Prostate Cancer.', 'SFMBT1 facilitates colon cancer cell metastasis and drug resistance combined with HMG20A.', 'Methylation Landscape: Targeting Writer or Eraser to Discover Anti-Cancer Drug.', 'The Roles of the Histone Protein Modifier EZH2 in the Uterus and Placenta.', 'EZH2 activates CHK1 signaling to promote ovarian cancer chemoresistance by maintaining the properties of cancer stem cells.', 'HNF1B, EZH2 and ECI2 in prostate carcinoma.

Methods: 109 mCRPC patients treated with a median of 3 cycles of 177Lu-PSMA-617 were included. Data were analyzed according to OS as well as PSA response patterns with regard to prior therapies, laboratory biomarkers and metastatic extent in univariate as well as multivariate Cox's proportional hazards models. PSA decline was assessed using the lowest PSA levels after the first cycle of therapy (initial PSA response) and during the entire observation period (best PSA response). Results: In total, 54 patients (49.5%) died during the observation period. First and second line chemotherapy were performed in 85% and 26%, and Abiraterone and Enzalutamide were administered in 83% and 85%, respectively. Any initial PSA decline occurred in 55% while 25% showed a PSA decline of ≥50%. The median estimated OS was 9.9 months (95% CI: 7.2-12.5) for all patients. Any initial decline of PSA was associated with significantly prolonged OS (15.5 vs. 5.7 months, p = 0.002). Second line cabazitaxel chemotherapy (6.7 vs. 15.7 months, p = 0.002) and presence of visceral metastases (5.9 vs. 16.4 months, p<0.001) were associated with shorter OS. Only visceral metastases remained significant in a multivariate analysis. Conclusion:177Lu-PSMA-617 is an effective therapy for patients with mCRPC.

The resulting lesions greatly contribute to patient morbidity and mortality, underscoring the need for defining how prostate metastases subvert the MSC-osteoblast differentiation program. To gain insights into this process we profiled the effects of co-culture of primary MSCs with validated bone metastatic prostate cancer cell line models. These analyses revealed a cast of shared differentially induced genes in MSC, including betaglycan, a co-receptor for TGFβ. Betaglycan has not been studied in the context of bone metastatic disease previously. Here we report that loss of betaglycan in MSC is sufficient to augment TGFβ signaling, proliferation and migration, and completely blocks the MSC-osteoblast differentiation program. Further, betaglycan was revealed as necessary for prostate cancer-induced osteogenesis in vivo. Mechanistically, gene expression analysis revealed betaglycan controls the expression of a large repertoire of genes in MSCs, and that betaglycan loss provokes >60-fold increase in the expression of Wnt5a that plays important roles in stemness. In accord with the increased Wnt5a levels, there was a marked induction of canonical Wnt signaling in betaglycan ablated MSCs, and the addition of recombinant Wnt5a to MSCs was sufficient to impair osteogenic differentiation. Finally, the addition of Wnt5a neutralizing antibody was sufficient to induce the expression of osteogenic genes in betaglycan-ablated MSCs. Collectively, these findings suggest a betaglycan-Wnt5a circuit represents an attractive vulnerability to ameliorate prostate cancer-induced osteogenesis.""","""['Leah M Cook', 'Jeremy S Frieling', 'Niveditha Nerlakanti', 'Jeremy J McGuire', 'Paul A Stewart', 'Karen L Burger', 'John L Cleveland', 'Conor C Lynch']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Oncogene""","""['Re: Betaglycan Drives the Mesenchymal Stromal Cell Osteogenic Program and Prostate Cancer-Induced Osteogenesis.', 'Re: Betaglycan Drives the Mesenchymal Stromal Cell Osteogenic Program and Prostate Cancer-Induced Osteogenesis.', 'Wnt 3a promotes proliferation and suppresses osteogenic differentiation of adult human mesenchymal stem cells.', 'miR-16-2* Interferes with WNT5A to Regulate Osteogenesis of Mesenchymal Stem Cells.', 'TLR4 Activation Promotes Bone Marrow MSC Proliferation and Osteogenic Differentiation via Wnt3a and Wnt5a Signaling.', 'More than an accessory: implications of type III transforming growth factor-beta receptor loss in prostate cancer.', 'γδ-Enriched CAR-T cell therapy for bone metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Transforming growth factor receptor III (Betaglycan) regulates the generation of pathogenic Th17 cells in EAE.', ""OLMALINC/OCT4/BMP2 axis enhances osteogenic-like phenotype of renal interstitial fibroblasts to participate in Randall's plaque formation."", 'Genome-wide expression screening in the cardiac embryonic stem cell test shows additional differentiation routes that are regulated by morpholines and piperidines.', 'Bone-targeted nanoplatform enables efficient modulation of bone tumor microenvironment for prostate cancer bone metastasis treatment.']"""

Despite their growing links to cancer, there has been limited characterization of circRNAs in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, the major cause of prostate cancer mortality. Here, through the analysis of an exome-capture RNA-seq dataset from 47 metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer samples and ribodepletion and RNase R RNA-sequencing of patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) and cell models, we identified 13 circRNAs generated from the key prostate cancer driver gene-androgen receptor (AR). We validated and characterized the top four most abundant, clinically relevant AR circRNAs. Expression of these AR circRNAs was upregulated during castration-resistant progression of PDXs. The upregulation was not due to global increase of circRNA formation in these tumors. Instead, the levels of AR circRNAs correlated strongly with that of the linear AR transcripts (both AR and AR variants) in clinical samples and PDXs, indicating a transcriptional mechanism of regulation. In cultured cells, androgen suppressed the expression of these AR circRNAs and the linear AR transcripts, and the suppression was attenuated by an antiandrogen. Using nuclear/cytoplasmic fractionation and RNA in-situ hybridization assays, we demonstrated predominant cytoplasmic localization of these AR circRNAs, indicating likely cytoplasmic functions. Overall, this is the first comprehensive characterization of circRNAs arising from the AR gene. With greater resistance to exoribonuclease compared to the linear AR transcripts and detectability of AR circRNAs in patient plasma, these AR circRNAs may serve as surrogate circulating markers for AR/AR-variant expression and castration-resistant prostate cancer progression.""","""['Subing Cao', 'Tianfang Ma', 'Nathan Ungerleider', 'Claire Roberts', 'Margaret Kobelski', 'Lianjin Jin', 'Monica Concha', 'Xia Wang', 'Melody Baddoo', 'Holly M Nguyen', 'Eva Corey', 'Ladan Fazli', 'Elisa Ledet', 'Rubin Zhang', 'Jonathan L Silberstein', 'Wensheng Zhang', 'Kun Zhang', 'Oliver Sartor', 'Xuesen Dong', 'Erik K Flemington', 'Yan Dong']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Oncogene""","""['Orphan nuclear receptor TLX contributes to androgen insensitivity in castration-resistant prostate cancer via its repression of androgen receptor transcription.', 'Androgen receptor splice variants activating the full-length receptor in mediating resistance to androgen-directed therapy.', 'Growth Inhibition by Testosterone in an Androgen Receptor Splice Variant-Driven Prostate Cancer Model.', 'Development of AR-V7 as a putative treatment selection marker for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Androgen receptor splicing variant 7: Beyond being a constitutively active variant.', 'Circular RNA circARHGEF28 inhibited the progression of prostate cancer via the miR-671-5p/LGALS3BP/NF-κB axis.', 'Plasma extracellular vesicle circRNA signature and resistance to abiraterone in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'circAR-E2E4-miR-665-STAT3 axis is a potential regulatory network in triple-negative breast cancer.', 'Molecular Mechanisms of Noncoding RNA in the Occurrence of Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Exosomes derived from myeloid-derived suppressor cells facilitate castration-resistant prostate cancer progression via S100A9/circMID1/miR-506-3p/MID1.']"""

During cancer development, autophagy may play both tumour-supporting and tumour-suppressing roles. Any relationships of autophagy to the established oncogene-induced replication stress (RS) and the ensuing DNA damage response (DDR)-mediated anti-cancer barrier in early tumorigenesis remain to be elucidated. Here, assessing potential links between autophagy, RS and DDR, we found that autophagy is enhanced in both early and advanced stages of human urinary bladder and prostate tumorigenesis. Furthermore, a high-content, single-cell-level microscopy analysis of human cellular models exposed to diverse genotoxic insults showed that autophagy is enhanced in cells that experienced robust DNA damage, independently of the cell-cycle position. Oncogene- and drug-induced RS triggered first DDR and later autophagy. Unexpectedly, genetic inactivation of autophagy resulted in RS, despite cellular retention of functional mitochondria and normal ROS levels. Moreover, recovery from experimentally induced RS required autophagy to support DNA synthesis. Consistently, RS due to the absence of autophagy could be partly alleviated by exogenous supply of deoxynucleosides. Our results highlight the importance of autophagy for DNA synthesis, suggesting that autophagy may support cancer progression, at least in part, by facilitating tumour cell survival and fitness under replication stress, a feature shared by most malignancies.

Cancer cells accumulate LDs and acidify their tumor microenvironment (TME) by increasing the proton pump V-ATPase. However, it is not known whether these two metabolic changes are mechanistically related or influence LD movement. We postulated that LD density and velocity are progressively increased with tumor aggressiveness and are dependent on V-ATPase and the lipolysis regulator pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF). LD density was assessed in human prostate cancer (PCa) specimens across Gleason scores (GS) 6-8. LD distribution and velocity were analyzed in low and highly aggressive tumors using live-cell imaging and in cells exposed to low pH and/or treated with V-ATPase inhibitors. The MT network was disrupted and analyzed by α-tubulin staining. LD density positively correlated with advancing GS in human tumors. Acidification promoted peripheral localization and clustering of LDs. Highly aggressive prostate, breast, and pancreatic cell lines had significantly higher maximum LD velocity (LDVmax) than less aggressive and benign cells. LDVmax was MT-dependent and suppressed by blocking V-ATPase directly or indirectly with PEDF. Upon lowering pH, LDs moved to the cell periphery and carried metalloproteinases. These results suggest that acidification of the TME can alter intracellular LD movement and augment velocity in cancer. Restoration of PEDF or blockade of V-ATPase can normalize LD distribution and decrease velocity.

Experimental design:   CellMinerCDB (http://discover.nci.nih.gov/cellminercdb) was used to mine the cancer cell lines genomic databases. The causality of Schlafen11 (SLFN11) was validated in isogenic cell lines. Because topoisomerase I (TOP1)-mediated replication DNA damage is repaired by homologous recombination (HR), we tested the ""synthetic lethality"" of HR-deficient (HRD) cells.

We also used an ovarian orthotopic allograft model with BRCA1 loss to validate the efficacy of LMP400 and olaparib combination.  Results:   CellMinerCDB reveals that SLFN11, which kills cells undergoing replicative stress, is a dominant drug determinant to the clinical indenoisoquinolines.

As a consequence, it is possible to achieve a single-step quantification of miRNAs in complex media without the process of enzymatic amplification, which can vastly simplify the detection procedure. Experimental results reveal that the assay permits ultrasensitive quantification of miR-141, with a limit of detection down to 33.9 aM, and show a high selectivity for discriminating miR-200 family members.

Serum levels of PSA decay due to the radiation-induced death of tumour cells and cancer recurrence usually manifest as a rising PSA. The current definition of biochemical relapse requires that PSA reaches nadir and starts increasing, which delays the use of further treatments. Also, these methods do not account for the post-radiation tumour dynamics that may contain early information on cancer recurrence. Here, we develop three mechanistic models of post-radiation PSA evolution. Our models render superior fits of PSA data in a patient cohort and provide a biological justification for the most common empirical formulation of PSA dynamics. We also found three model-based prognostic variables: the proliferation rate of the survival fraction, the ratio of radiation-induced cell death rate to the survival proliferation rate, and the time to PSA nadir since treatment termination. We argue that these markers may enable the early identification of biochemical relapse, which would permit physicians to subsequently adapt patient monitoring to optimize the detection and treatment of cancer recurrence.""","""['Guillermo Lorenzo', 'Víctor M Pérez-García', 'Alfonso Mariño', 'Luis A Pérez-Romasanta', 'Alessandro Reali', 'Hector Gomez']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""J R Soc Interface""","""['Prostate specific antigen as an outcome variable for T1 and T2 prostate cancer treated by radiation therapy.', 'Serum prostate-specific antigen after radiation therapy for clinically localized prostate cancer: prognostic implications.', 'Effect of obesity on prostate-specific antigen recurrence after radiation therapy for localized prostate cancer as measured by the 2006 Radiation Therapy Oncology Group-American Society for Therapeutic Radiation and Oncology (RTOG-ASTRO) Phoenix consensus definition.', 'Prostate-specific antigen to predict outcome of external beam radiation for prostate cancer: Walter Reed Army Medical Center experience, 1988-1995.', 'Prostate specific antigen only progression of prostate cancer.', 'Predicting regrowth of low-grade gliomas after radiotherapy.', 'Patient-specific forecasting of postradiotherapy prostate-specific antigen kinetics enables early prediction of biochemical relapse.', 'High Accuracy Indicators of Androgen Suppression Therapy Failure for Prostate Cancer-A Modeling Study.', 'Integrating mechanism-based modeling with biomedical imaging to build practical digital twins for clinical oncology.', 'Intermittent radiotherapy as alternative treatment for recurrent high grade glioma: a modeling study based on longitudinal tumor measurements.']"""

The BAP1 gene (BRCA1-associated protein 1) is a tumor suppressor gene involved in DNA repair via homologous recombination. BAP1 regulates the cell cycle, differentiation, DNA damage responses, and cell proliferation through deubiquitination. Somatic mutations in the BAP1 gene are common in many types of tumors.  Observation:   Two families harboring a germline mutation in the BAP1 gene were diagnosed at Masaryk Memorial Cancer Institute (MMCI). A 27-year-old index female from one family was followed-up for multiple nevi. Her mother and uncle had malignant mesothelioma, and her maternal grandmother had uveal melanoma. The index case tested positive for a BAP1 (NM_004656.2): c.217delG/p.Asp73Metfs*5 frame-shift mutation. The melanoma was removed at the age of 28 and 31. In the second family, an 11-year-old index female had two nevi removed from her head, and a spitzoid-type skin lesion was diagnosed at the age of 11. Her 34-year-old mother had multiple nevi, and a skin lesion of spitzoid-type was removed from the abdomen. Both patients harbored a BAP1 (NM_004656.2): c.123-1G&gt;T acceptor splice site mutation (IARC [International Agency for Research on Cancer] class 4 [probably pathogenic]). Preventive measures for BAP1 syndrome should include known risks for cancer. Tumors occur early and repeatedly. At the MMCI, we recommend physical examination by an oncologist, eyes and skin examination, every 6 months; whole-body magnetic resonance imaging, including the central nervous system, every year (or low-dose computed tomography/chest and abdomen magnetic resonance imaging); annual abdominal ultrasound, breast ultrasound, or mammography; a gynecological ultrasound examination every 6 months; colonoscopy starting at the age of 45; and other suitable surveillances based on family history.  Conclusion:   BAP1 syndrome is a complex cancer syndrome with a high risk of rare malignant mesothelioma, malignant skin and uveal melanoma, spitzoid-type skin lesions, and other tumors. Detection of this syndrome is essential for the survival of high-risk individuals. Supported by the grant project MH CZ - RVO (MMCI, 00209805).

The crude death rates (CDR), standardised death rates (SDR), standard expected years of life lost per living person (SEYLLp) and per death (SEYLLd) values were calculated. Joinpoint models were used to analyse time trends. In the study period, 61,928 men died of PCa. The values of mortality rates in 2000 (per 100,000) were: CDR = 16.97, SDR = 16.17, SEYLLp = 332.1. In 2015, the values of all rates increased: CDR = 26.22, SDR = 16.69, SEYLLp = 429.5. However, the SEYLLd value decreased from 15.62 to one man who died due to PCa in 2000 to 13.78 in 2015. The highest SEYLLp values occurred in the group of men with primary education (619.5 in 2000 and 700.7 in 2015). They were respectively 2.24 and 2.96 times higher than in men with higher education (275.7 and 237.1).

The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether leukocyte mitochondrial DNA copy number (mtDNAcn) is associated with aggressive prostate cancer (PCa) in African American (AA) men. We measured the mtDNAcn in peripheral blood leukocytes from 317 localized AA PCa patients and evaluated its associations with aggressive disease features at diagnosis and biochemical recurrence (BCR) after treatments. There was no significant difference in mtDNAcn among the clinical features at diagnosis, including age, prostate-specific antigen level, Gleason score and clinical stage under analysis of variance test. However, mtDNAcn was significantly associated with BCR in multivariate Cox analysis. Dichotomized into low and high mtDNAcn groups by the median value of mtDNAcn, patients with low mtDNAcn exhibited a significantly lower risk of BCR (hazard ratio = 0.32, 95% confidence interval: 0.13-0.79) compared to those with high mtDNAcn. There was a significant dose-response in tertile and quartile analyses (P for trend = 0.012 and 0.002, respectively). In Kaplan-Meier survival analyses, patients with higher mtDNAcn exhibited significantly shorter BCR-free survival time than those with lower mtDNAcn in dichotomous, tertile and quartile analyses, with long-rank P values of 0.017, 0.024 and 0.019, respectively.

Methods:   A total of 25 patients with prostate cancer and 15 with endometrial cancer were analysed. The %GP values of 2D and 3D verifications with different acceptance criteria (1%/1 mm, 2%/2 mm, and 3%/3 mm) were obtained using OmniPro and Compass. The %DE was calculated using a planned dose volume histogram (DVH) created in Monaco's treatment planning system (TPS), which relates radiation dose to tissue and the patient's predicted dose volume histogram in Compass. Statistical correlation between %GP and %DE was verified using Pearson's correlation coefficient. Sensitivity was calculated based on the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve. Plans were calculated using Collapsed Cone Convolution and the Monte Carlo algorithm.  Results:   The t-test results of the planned and estimated DVH showed that the mean values were comparable (P > 0.05). For the 3%/3 mm criterion, the average %GP was acceptable for the prostate and endometrial cancer groups, with average rates of 99.68 ± 0.49% and 99.03 ± 0.59% for 2D and 99.86 ± 0.39% and 99.53 ± 0.44% for 3D, respectively. The number of correlations was poor for all analysed data. The mean Pearson's R-values for prostate and endometrial cancer were < 0.45 and < 0.43, respectively. The area under the ROC curve for the prostate and endometrial cancer groups, was lower than 0.667.

CRF is a multidimensional experience and is often solely assessed by self-report measures. The goal of the study is to examine the physical and cognitive aspects of self-reported CRF using a cognitive function test and a physical fatigue index in order to provide objective measures that can characterize the CRF phenotype.  Methods:   A total of 59 subjects with nonmetastatic prostate cancer receiving external beam radiation therapy were included in the study. Fatigue was measured using the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Fatigue (FACT-F) questionnaire. Cognitive characteristics of CRF was measured using the Stroop Color-Word Interference computerized test and the motor aspect of fatigue was measured using the static fatigue test using a handgrip dynamometer.  Findings:   Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Fatigue scores significantly correlated with the Stroop Interference score, but not performance accuracy in all test conditions. Fatigued subjects exhibited a more rapid decline to 50% of maximal strength and increased static fatigue index in the handgrip test, whereas maximal grip strength was not affected.  Conclusions:   The results suggest that CRF exhibits both cognitive and physical characteristics. Subjective fatigue was associated with increased time required to overcome cognitive interference, but not cognitive performance accuracy. Fatigued patients exhibited decreased physical endurance and the ability to sustain maximal strength over time.

Using standardized national occupation and industrial classifications, we first identified the longest-held job for each patient. Using sales workers as the reference group, odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated by conditional logistic regression, adjusted for age, admission period, and the admitting hospital, with smoking, alcohol consumption, and lifestyle diseases as covariates. The risk of high and low occupational physical activity was also estimated.  Results:   Across all occupations, a reduced risk for all common cancers among males was observed among those occupations associated with high physical activities, such as agriculture.

Both of these diseases share common pathogenesis involving inflammation of prostatic tissues. Chronic inflammation will induce the release of cytokines, followed by cells injury and tissues damage. One of the cytokines that play a role in prostate pathology is IL-6. The inflammation will also induce the releases of anti-inflammatory cytokines such as TGFβ-1.  Aim:   This study aims to analyse the expression of IL-6 and TGFβ-1, in prostate hyperplasia and prostate cancer.  Material and methods:   This is an observational study, using paraffin-embedded tissue samples of prostate hyperplasia and prostate cancer. Samples were obtained from the laboratory of Pathological Anatomy, Faculty of Medicine, Andalas University, Padang, Indonesia. Immunohistochemistry was performed to detect the cytokine expression, and a semiqunatitaves measurement according to Immunoreactive score (IRS) was performed for evaluation. For the TGFβ-1, the stromal expression was also analysed by measurement of the stromal stained area. The correlation of cytokine expression to Gleason index score was also analysed in prostate cancer.  Results:   The result showed that this study found that TGFβ-1 was detected both in the stromal component as well as epithelial. With the stromal being the dominant site of expression. The stromal TGFβ-1 expression was of significantly higher in prostate hyperplasia compares to prostate cancer (p < 0.05), while the epithelial expression of TGFβ-1 was not found to be significantly different. IL-6 was mostly expressed intracytoplasmic in epithelia. The IL-6 expression was significantly higher in prostate cancer compared to hyperplasia. However, there was no significant correlation to found between IL-6 expression to the Gleason Score among prostate cancers.

First, we found that vitamin E in the human prostate epithelial RWPE-1 cell line has the remarkable ability to upregulate the expression of various phase-I activating cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes, including activators of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), giving rise to supraphysiological levels of reactive oxygen species. Furthermore, our rat model confirmed that vitamin E in the prostate has a powerful booster effect on CYP enzymes associated with the generation of oxidative stress, thereby favoring lipid-derived electrophile spread that covalently modifies proteins. We show that vitamin E not only causes DNA damage but also promotes cell transformation frequency induced by the PAH-prototype benzo[a]pyrene.

Thus, it is important to identify new ways to avoid this problem. For example, statins have shown positive effects on erectile function and may have anti-inflammatory effects that improve recovery after surgery.  Aim:   The aim of this exploratory analysis of a subgroup from ESTO1, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, was to evaluate the preoperative use of atorvastatin on erectile function after radical prostatectomy.  Method:   Patients were randomized to either 80 mg atorvastatin or placebo daily before undergoing radical prostatectomy from study inclusion to the day of surgery. Altogether 118 men with prostate cancer and scheduled for radical prostatectomy were asked to fill out the 5-item version of the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF-5) questionnaire before surgery and at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after surgery.  Main outcome measurements:   The study was exploratory, with the main outcome being the overall difference between IIEF-5 scores in the 2 groups at 12 months. Several hypotheses generating sub-analyses were conducted.  Results:   Overall, 85% filled out the IIEF-5 questionnaire before their operation and 85%, 81%, 78%, and 78% completed it at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months follow-up, respectively. 52% of men had information available at all time points. There were no statistically significant differences between the groups at baseline in either erectile function, comorbidities, or tumor characteristics. The median duration of use of atorvastatin and placebo before surgery was 27 and 25 days, respectively. Preoperative atorvastatin treatment had no statistically significant effect on erectile function after prostatectomy as compared with placebo, although IIEF-5 scores were higher at all time points in the statin arm. Furthermore, atorvastatin treatment compared with placebo improved IIEF-5 scores at 12 months after surgery when the cavernous nerves were at least partially intact bilaterally (P < .04, n = 65); however, after full bilateral or unilateral nerve-sparing, the difference was not statistically significant.  Clinical implication:   Short-term statin treatment did not improve recovery of erectile function after prostatectomy; however, further studies are needed before final conclusions.  Strengths & limitations:   This was a randomized placebo-controlled study. Original ESTO1 study was designed to detect a difference in prostate cancer biomarkers.  Conclusion:   Short-term atorvastatin treatment before radical prostatectomy had no statistically significant effect on the recovery of erectile functions in a non-selected cohort of patients undergoing radical prostatectomy. Further studies will be needed to clarify the role of long-term atorvastatin use before and after prostatectomy. Siltari A, Riikonen J, Fode M, et al.

We retrospectively analysed all men that underwent RALP between April 2010 and November 2018 from our prospectively collected IRB approved database. All patients who developed lymphoceles were grouped into two groups, the ones who were drained and those not drained. Chi-square test was used to perform univariate analysis for categorical variables and student's t test for continuous variables. Odds ratio was calculated using logistic multiple regression analysis. A P value of less than 0.05 was considered significant. The size of the lymphocele, the number of nodes retrieved, and BMI were significant factors that led to the drainage of lymphocele. The patients with lymphoceles larger than 10 cm had an odds ratio of 47.5 and those between 5 and 10 had an odds ratio of 10.7. The odds ratio of drainage in patients with BMI above 30 was 2.1. The odds of drainage were 8.8 when more than 10 nodes were taken. After PLND ultrasound could be effective in early identification of patients who could potentially need drainage.

This pathway is suppressed by the E3 ubiquitin ligase membrane-associated RING-CH-type finger 6 (MARCH6); however, little is known of MARCH6 regulation, particularly at the transcriptional level. Here, we consulted large transcriptomic PCa datasets to investigate transcription factors and DNA sequence elements that regulate the MARCH6 gene. Amongst 498 primary PCa tissues of The Cancer Genome Atlas, we identified a striking positive correlation between MARCH6 and androgen receptor (AR) gene expression (r = 0.81, p < 1 × 10-117) that held in other primary tumour datasets. Two putative androgen response elements were identified in the MARCH6 gene using motif prediction and mining of publicly accessible chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing data. However, MARCH6 expression was not androgen-responsive in luciferase reporter and qRT-PCR assays. Instead, we established that the MARCH6-AR correlation in primary PCa is due to common regulation by the transcription factor Sp1. We located a region 100 bp downstream of the MARCH6 transcriptional start site that contains three Sp1 binding sites and strongly upregulates promoter activity. The functionality of this region, and Sp1-mediated upregulation of MARCH6, was confirmed using pharmacological and genetic inhibition of Sp1. Moreover, modulation of Sp1 activity affected the stability of squalene monooxygenase, a cholesterol biosynthesis enzyme and MARCH6 substrate. We thus establish Sp1 as the first known regulator of the MARCH6 gene and demonstrate that interrogation of transcriptomic datasets can assist in the de novo inference of transcriptional regulation.""","""['Hudson W Coates', 'Ngee Kiat Chua', 'Andrew J Brown']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Biochim Biophys Acta Mol Cell Biol Lipids""","""['Androgen receptor induces EPHA3 expression by interacting with transcription factor SP1.', 'Cholesterol increases protein levels of the E3 ligase MARCH6 and thereby stimulates protein degradation.', 'Involvement of transcription factor Sp1 in quercetin-mediated inhibitory effect on the androgen receptor in human prostate cancer cells.', 'Androgen up-regulates vascular endothelial growth factor expression in prostate cancer cells via an Sp1 binding site.', 'Nuclear receptor interaction protein, a coactivator of androgen receptors (AR), is regulated by AR and Sp1 to feed forward and activate its own gene expression through AR protein stability.', 'Hypoxia truncates and constitutively activates the key cholesterol synthesis enzyme squalene monooxygenase.', 'The MARCHF6 E3 ubiquitin ligase acts as an NADPH sensor for the regulation of ferroptosis.', 'MARCH6 promotes Papillary Thyroid Cancer development by destabilizing DHX9.', 'SQLE Mediates Metabolic Reprogramming to Promote LN Metastasis in Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'MARCH6 promotes hepatocellular carcinoma development through up-regulation of ATF2.']"""

Wilcoxon rank sum test was used to compare the expression of miRNAs in pre-RP plasma between pathologic tumor stage (T2 vs. T3) and Gleason score (6-7 [3 + 4] vs. ≥ 7 [4 + 3]) groups. Partial correlation coefficient between the expression of miRNAs in pre-RP plasma and serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level at RP, adjusting for age, was calculated.  Results:   Twenty-nine men, aged 43 to 77 years, were included. Median follow-up time after RP was 55 days. There was no significant change in the expression of miRNAs in plasma from before to after RP.

Overall, there were no statistically significant relationships observed between the expression of these circulating miRNAs and Gleason score and serum PSA at RP.  Conclusions:   There was no significant change in the expression of circulating miRNAs in plasma from before to approximately 2 months after RP. This finding may be due to the lack of immediate effect RP may have on the expression of circulating miRNAs. However, higher expression of miR-34a, -378, and -450b-5p in plasma was found among patients with more advanced disease at RP.

In vivo, the prodrug is readily metabolized to abiraterone and its active metabolite Δ(4)-abiraterone (D4A) which selectively and irreversibly inhibit the 17α-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase (CYP17A1) enzyme and the androgen receptor, respectively. Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) of abiraterone and its metabolites may be beneficial as significant pharmacokinetic variability has been observed. Dried plasma spots (DPS) represent an attractive, yet under-utilised approach for TDM analysis with desired features including easy collection, transport, storage and overcomes the issues of blood hematocrit levels known in dried blood spot analysis. In this study we developed and validated a liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) assay for the simultaneous quantification of abiraterone and D4A with deuterated internal standard (abiraterone D4) from DPS using a high-resolution benchtop mass spectrometer. Calibration curves were linear over a wide and clinically-relevant concentration range (0.132-196.0 ng/mL for abiraterone and 0.110-39.17 ng/mL for D4A) with high accuracy (93-104% for abiraterone and 96-108% for D4A) and precision (%CV ≤ 12.5). As expected, the levels of abiraterone and D4A obtained from DPS from mCRPC patients varied substantially (1.5-31.4 ng/mL for abiraterone and 0.1-5.2 ng/mL for D4A; n = 22). Detailed benchmarking of the DPS method to a pre-validated liquid plasma method showed that the techniques generate quantitative indistinguishable data. Collectively, this demonstrates the potential of using LC-MS/MS in combination with DPS for TDM of abiraterone and D4A from patients.""","""['Atul Bhatnagar', 'Matthew J McKay', 'Morten Thaysen-Andersen', 'Malmaruha Arasaratnam', 'Megan Crumbaker', 'Howard Gurney', 'Mark P Molloy']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""J Chromatogr B Analyt Technol Biomed Life Sci""","""['Quantitation of the anticancer drug abiraterone and its metabolite Δ(4)-abiraterone in human plasma using high-resolution mass spectrometry.', 'An LC-MS/MS method for quantification of abiraterone, its active metabolites D(4)-abiraterone (D4A) and 5α-abiraterone, and their inactive glucuronide derivatives.', 'An LC-MS/MS method for quantification of the active abiraterone metabolite Δ(4)-abiraterone (D4A) in human plasma.', 'Bioanalytical LC-MS/MS validation of therapeutic drug monitoring assays in oncology.', 'Bioanalytical method validation and sample analysis for nirmatrelvir in dried blood collected using the Tasso-M20 device.']"""

Experimental data indicate that bone metastasis is mostly mediated by blood flow-dependent, passive arrest of circulating tumor cells to the bone metastatic niche (BMN). Here, we have set out to test these experimental observations in a clinical, human setting to improve our understanding of MSD. 507 patients, treated on spinal metastases in our institution from 2005 to 2015 were retrospectively evaluated. We identified 259 patients with accessible staging reports of the skeleton before and at initial diagnosis of MSD. Data analysis comprised localizations of bone metastases, underlying malignancy and time to development of MSD. Dissemination pattern of bone metastasis was correlated with red bone marrow (RBM) content of the respective bone as a measure of blood flow. Spinal metastases occurred most frequently in lung cancer (21%), prostate cancer (19%), and breast cancer (12%). At the diagnosis of MSD, majority of patients have multiple extra-spinal bone metastases (2/3). The distribution of metastases to extra-spinal bones and to the spine is mostly proportional to the RBM content of the involved bone. Corresponding to the high RBM content, thoracic spine, pelvic bones and ribs represent a predilection site for bone metastasis. We confirm a distinct preference of cancer types to metastasize to bones. When it comes to bone metastases all primaries show uniform distribution pattern, which supports the hypothesis of a predominantly blood flow-dependent distribution of tumor cells and passive arrest to the BMN rather than a spine-specific homing mechanism.""","""['Julia S Onken', 'Lucius S Fekonja', 'Romy Wehowsky', 'Vanessa Hubertus', 'Peter Vajkoczy']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Clin Exp Metastasis""","""['Pattern and distribution of bone metastases in common malignant tumors.', 'Approaching spinal metastases spread profile.', 'Diagnostic imaging of bone metastases.', 'Bone and bone marrow metastases of pulmonary cancer with special reference to the relationship with distribution of the vertebral vein and red marrow.', 'Imaging of bone metastases.', 'Evaluation of prognostic preoperative factors in patients undergoing surgery for spinal metastases: Results in a consecutive series of 81 cases.', 'Survival after surgery for spinal metastatic disease: a nationwide multiregistry cohort study.', 'Clinicopathological characteristics and prognostic risk factors of breast cancer patients with bone metastasis.', 'How to Target Spinal Metastasis in Experimental Research: An Overview of Currently Used Experimental Mouse Models and Future Prospects.', 'New insights into patterns of first metastatic sites influencing survival of patients with hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer: a multicenter study of 271 patients.']"""

Methods:   We retrospectively reviewed the Vizient Database (Irving, Texas) from September 2014 to December 2017. Vizient includes ~ 97% of academic hospitals (AH) and more than 60 community hospitals (CH). Patients aged ≥ 18 with urologic malignancies who underwent surgical treatment were included. Chi square and Student t tests were used to compare categorical and continuous variables, respectively.  Results:   We identified a total of 37,628 cases. There were 33,290 (88%) procedures performed in AH and 4330 (12%) in CH. These included prostatectomy (18,540), radical nephrectomy (rNx) 8059, partial nephrectomy (pNx) (5287), radical cystectomy (4421), radical nephroureterectomy (rNu) (1006), and partial cystectomy (321). There were no significant differences in 30-day readmission rates or mortality for any procedure between academic and community hospitals (Table 1), p > 0.05 for all.

Methods: Before targeted and systematic prostate biopsy, mpMRI and 18F-choline PET/CT were performed on 56 evaluable subjects with 90 Likert score 3-5 mpMRI target lesions, using a 18F-choline target-to-background ratio of greater than 1.58 to indicate a positive 18F-choline result. Prostate biopsies were performed after registration of real-time transrectal ultrasound with T2-weighted MRI. A mixed-effects logistic regression was applied to measure the performance of mpMRI (based on prospective Likert and retrospective Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System, version 2 [PI-RADS], scores) compared with 18F-choline PET/mpMRI to detect Gleason ≥ 3+4 cancer. Results: The per-lesion accuracy of systematic plus targeted biopsy for mpMRI alone was 67.8% (area under receiver-operating-characteristic curve [AUC], 0.73) for Likert 4-5 and 70.0% (AUC, 0.76) for PI-RADS 3-5. Several PET/MRI models incorporating 18F-choline with mpMRI data were investigated. The most promising model selected all high-risk disease on mpMRI (Likert 5 or PI-RADS 5) plus low- and intermediate-risk disease (Likert 4 or PI-RADS 3-4), with an elevated 18F-choline target-to-background ratio greater than 1.58 as positive for significant cancer. Using this approach, the accuracy on a per-lesion basis significantly improved to 88.9% for Likert (AUC, 0.90; P < 0.001) and 91.1% for PI-RADS (AUC, 0.92; P < 0.001). On a per-patient basis, the accuracy improved to 92.9% for Likert (AUC, 0.93; P < 0.001) and to 91.1% for PI-RADS (AUC, 0.91; P = 0.009).

In this first-in-human study of the pan-BET inhibitor mivebresib (ABBV-075), the safety profile, MTD, and recommended phase II dose (RP2D) were determined in patients with advanced solid tumors.  Patients and methods:   A 3 + 3 dose escalation for different mivebresib dosing schedules [daily, Monday/Wednesday/Friday (M-W-F), 4 days on/3 off (4/7)] was followed by dose expansion in patients with prostate cancer. Endpoints were safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and preliminary antitumor activity.  Results:   Seventy-two patients with solid tumors (14% uveal melanoma; 11% colorectal; 11% breast; 8% pancreatic; 7% head/neck; 49% others) were treated with mivebresib during dose escalation, and 12 additional patients with prostate cancer in expansion cohort. Most common treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAE) related to mivebresib were dysgeusia (49%), thrombocytopenia (48%), fatigue (26%), and nausea (25%). Most common grade 3/4 TEAEs related to mivebresib were thrombocytopenia (35%) and anemia (6%). Dose-limiting toxicities included thrombocytopenia (2 mg daily; 4.5 mg M-W-F), gastrointestinal bleed (2 mg daily), hypertension (2-3 mg 4/7), fatigue, decreased appetite, and aspartate aminotransferase elevation (4 mg M-W-F). Of 61 evaluable patients from dose escalation, 26 (43%) had stable disease and 35 (57%) had progressive disease. Median progression-free survival was 1.8 months (95% confidence interval, 1.8-1.9).

Consequently, little is known about the effects of these medications on these vulnerable patients.  Objective:   To assess the short-term outcomes of AA and ENZ in patients with pre-existing CVDs.  Design, setting, and participants:   A population-based retrospective study. The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-Medicare-linked database was used to identify prostate cancer patients using AA or ENZ.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   The primary endpoint was 6-mo all-cause mortality, analyzed using modified Poisson regression modeling of relative risk (RR) adjusted for confounders and comorbidities.  Results and limitations:   Among eligible patients (2845 with AA and 1031 with ENZ), 67% had at least one pre-existing CVD. Compared with those without pre-existing CVDs, having one to two pre-existing CVDs was associated with 16% higher 6-mo mortality (RR=1.16, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.00-1.36), and the risk increased further among those having three or more CVDs (RR=1.56, 95% CI: 1.29-1.88). Most of the differences in survival of patients with pre-existing CVD condition occurred within the first 6mo of treatment.  Conclusions:   After treatment with AA or ENZ, elderly prostate cancer patients with pre-existing CVDs experienced higher short-term mortality than otherwise similar patients without CVDs. Mortality associated with CVDs did not depend on having received AA versus ENZ.  Patient summary:   Patients with pre-existing cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) experienced higher short-term mortality after abiraterone acetate or enzalutamide than those without pre-existing CVDs.

Results:   In this meta-analysis, we found that the AA genotype of HIF1α 1790G/A was positively associated with the risk of RCC in overall populations, Caucasians, but not for Asians. G allele and GG genotype were not associated with the susceptibility of RCC in overall populations, Caucasians, and Asians. The G allele was negatively associated with PCa susceptibility in overall populations, Asians, but not for Caucasians. GG genotype was negatively associated with PCa susceptibility in Asians, but not for overall populations and Caucasians. HIF1α 1790G/A AA genotype was not associated with PCa susceptibility in overall populations of Caucasians or Asians.  Conclusion:   AA genotype of HIF1α 1790G/A was positively associated with RCC risk in overall populations and Caucasians. Furthermore, the G allele was negatively associated with prostate cancer susceptibility in overall populations, Asians, and GG genotype was negatively associated with PCa susceptibility in Asians.""","""['Hong-Yan Li', 'Tianbiao Zhou', 'Wenshan Lin', 'Shujun Lin', 'Hongzhen Zhong']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""BMC Med Genet""","""['Association of hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha gene polymorphism with renal cell carcinoma susceptibility.', 'HIF-1α -1790G>A polymorphism significantly increases the risk of digestive tract cancer: a meta-analysis.', 'Relationship between GSTM1/GSTT1 null genotypes and renal cell carcinoma risk: a meta-analysis.', 'Relationship between Vitamin D receptor gene polymorphism and renal cell carcinoma susceptibility.', 'Association of vitamin D receptor gene polymorphism with the risk of renal cell carcinoma: a meta-analysis.', 'Association of HIF1-α gene polymorphisms with advanced non-small cell lung cancer prognosis in patients receiving radiation therapy.']"""

However, the majority of PCa patients receiving the androgen deprivation therapy develop recurrent castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) within two years. Chemotherapies show little effect on prolonging survival of CRPC patients and new treatments are needed. Previous studies reported that the extracts from rooibos (Aspalathus linearis) exhibit chemopreventive properties in some cancer models, including skin, liver and oesophagus cancers in animals. We therefore investigate if extracts from rooibos can suppress the proliferation of CRPC cells.  Purpose:   We investigated whether an aspalathin-rich green rooibos extract (GRT™; 12.78 g aspalathin/100 g extract) demonstrates anti-cancer activity against CRPC cells.  Methods:   High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was used to profile the major flavonoids in GRT. Hoechst-dye proliferation assay, 3,4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2-5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) viability assay and flow cytometry assay were used to explore the effects of GRT on the proliferation and cell cycle progression of CRPC cells. Comet assay was used to survey whether GRT induces apoptosis in CRPC cells. LNCaP 104-R1 xenograft nude mice model was used to determine the inhibitory effect of GRT on CRPC tumors in vivo. Micro-Western Array (MWA) and Western blot analysis were carried out to unravel the underlying molecular mechanism.  Results:   GRT contained aspalathin as the most abundant flavonoid. GRT suppressed the proliferation and survival of LNCaP 104-R1, LNCaP FGC and PC-3 PCa cells. Flow cytometry analysis showed that GRT decreased the population of PCa cells in S phase but increased the cell population in G2/M phase. Comet assay confirmed that GRT induced apoptosis in LNCaP 104-R1 cells. Gavage of 400 mg/kg GRT suppressed LNCaP 104-R1 xenografts in castrated nude mice. MWA and Western blot analysis indicated that GRT treatment suppressed Akt1, phospho-Akt Ser473, Cdc2, Bcl-2, TRAF4 and Aven, but increased activated Caspase 3, cytochrome c, and p27Kip1. Overexpression of Akt rescued the suppressive effects of GRT on CRPC cells. Co-treatment of GRT with Bcl-2 inhibitor ABT-737, PI3K inhibitor LY294002 and Akt inhibitor GSK 690693 exhibited additive inhibitory effect on proliferation of CRPC cells.

Magnetic resonance guided radiation therapy (MRgRT) was clinically introduced in 2014. MrgRT allows for SBRT delivery with smaller uncertainty margins and permits daily adaptive planning. A phase 2 study in patients with localized prostate cancer was performed to study early GI and GU toxicity after SBRT using MRgRT.  Methods and materials:   One hundred one patients with clinical stage T1-3bN0M0 prostate cancer were enrolled in this prospective phase 2 study. All but 4 patients had intermediate- or high-risk prostate cancer, and 82.2% received adjuvant hormonal treatment. MRgRT was delivered in 5 fractions of 7.25 Gy to the target volume using daily plan adaptation with simultaneous relative sparing of the urethra to a dose of 6.5 Gy per fraction. Early toxicity was studied using both clinician- (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events and Radiation Therapy Oncology Group) and patient-reported outcome measurements (European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire-C30, Quality of Life Questionnaire PR25, and International Prostate Symptom Scoring).  Results:   The maximum cumulative grade ≥2 early GU and GI toxicity measured by any symptom at any study time point was 23.8% and 5.0%, respectively. No early grade 3 GI toxicity was observed. Early grade 3 GU toxicity was 0% and 5.9% according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events and Radiation Therapy Oncology Group and scoring systems, respectively, as a result of different grading of radiation cystitis. The low incidence of early GI toxicity was confirmed by patient-reported outcome data. GU grade ≥2 toxicity peaked to 19.8% at the end of MRgRT, followed by a return to the baseline average score at 3-month follow-up.

Methods:   We identified patients with at least 1 PI-RADS 4 lesion who underwent multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging-ultrasound fusion prostate biopsy. Patients were grouped into 1 of 4 cohorts-cohort 1 (a PI-RADS 4 index lesion and an additional PI-RADS 2 or 3 lesion), cohort 2 (single lesion with PI-RADS 4), cohort 3 (2 or more PI-RADS 4 lesions), or cohort 4 (a PI-RADS 4 lesion and an index lesion with PI-RADS 5).

This glycomics-centric study investigates a possible link between protein paucimannosylation, an under-studied class of human N-glycosylation [Man1-3 GlcNAc2 Fuc0-1 ], and cancer. The paucimannosidic glycans (PMGs) of 34 cancer cell lines and 133 tissue samples spanning 11 cancer types and matching non-cancerous specimens are profiled from 467 published and unpublished PGC-LC-MS/MS N-glycome datasets collected over a decade. PMGs, particularly Man2-3 GlcNAc2 Fuc1 , are prominent features of 29 cancer cell lines, but the PMG level varies dramatically across and within the cancer types (1.0-50.2%). Analyses of paired (tumor/non-tumor) and stage-stratified tissues demonstrate that PMGs are significantly enriched in tumor tissues from several cancer types including liver cancer (p = 0.0033) and colorectal cancer (p = 0.0017) and is elevated as a result of prostate cancer and chronic lymphocytic leukaemia progression (p < 0.05). Surface expression of paucimannosidic epitopes is demonstrated on human glioblastoma cells using immunofluorescence while biosynthetic involvement of N-acetyl-β-hexosaminidase is indicated by quantitative proteomics.

Methods:   The census was conducted in mid-2018 with distribution to all radiation oncologists and trainees listed on the college database in Australia, New Zealand, Singapore and overseas. There were new questions about hours spent on multidisciplinary meetings (MDTS), leadership positions held, management of inpatients, hypofractionation, stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT), income type and gynae-oncology work for radiation oncologists. Trainees were asked about time spent on planning and contouring.  Results:   The overall response rate was 69.9% with 67.7% of radiation oncologists and 77.9% of trainees responding. There were 514 radiation oncologists with 60% male and a mean age of 49 years (median = 46 years, range 31-91). The majority of respondents were Caucasian (57.7%) and from New South Wales (29.4%). Sixty-one per cent were subspecialists with breast, SBRT and urological cancers, the most popular areas of interest, and 56% held leadership positions. The majority worked in the public sector (55.7%), but 31.7% worked solely in the private sector with an average working week of 43.4 hours (h) (median = 44, range 2-110). Radiation oncologists spent an average of 3.6 h on MDTS (median = 4 h), 2.2h (median = 2 h) on simulation and 8 h (median = 5 h) on contouring per week. They averaged 245 new patients (median = 250, range 30-695) and 25 inpatients (median = 20) per year. Hypofractionation was used for radical treatment of breast (75%) and prostate cancer (49%). Radiation oncologists were mainly remunerated with a fixed income (53%) with 40% having some incentive-based income. There were 140 trainees with an equal male and female distribution. The large majority (88%) were satisfied with their career and network (83%). Most trainees worked between 36 and 55h per week with 15% having no protected time. Most trainees spent less than 5 hours on planning each week and job availability remained a major concern (90%).  Conclusions:   The radiation oncologist numbers have increased significantly, but unemployment remains low. Many parameters remain similar to the 2014 census, but new information has been obtained on special interest areas, leadership positions, gynae-oncology, inpatients, hypofractionation use, remuneration and contouring. Trainee numbers remain stable with an increased percentage satisfied with their career with much less concern about oversupply. Protected time remains an issue with contouring time and teaching emerging as a potential issue.""","""['John Leung', 'Dion Forstner', 'Raph Chee', 'Melissa James', 'Eddy Que', 'Shahin Begum']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""J Med Imaging Radiat Oncol""","""['Faculty of Radiation Oncology 2014 workforce census.', 'Faculty of Radiation Oncology 2018 workforce census: the status of the radiation oncology workforce in New Zealand.', 'Faculty of Radiation Oncology 2012 trainee survey: perspectives on choice of specialty training and future work practice preferences.', 'Gender diversity and leadership in Radiation Oncology in Australia and New Zealand.', 'Australian & New Zealand Faculty of Radiation Oncology Genito-Urinary Group: 2010 consensus guidelines for definitive external beam radiotherapy for prostate carcinoma.', 'Representation of Women in Canadian Radiation Oncology Trainees and Radiation Oncologists: Progress or Regress?', 'A national survey of the radiotherapy dosimetrist workforce in the UK.', 'Clinical implementation of deep learning contour autosegmentation for prostate radiotherapy.', '""There\'s Not Enough Bodies to Do the Demand:"" An Exploration of Key Stakeholder Views on the Role of Health Service Capacity in Shaping Cancer Outcomes in 7 International Cancer Benchmarking Partnership Countries.']"""

Early studies on transgenic mice showed promising results in the reduction of amyloid plaques.However, curcumin is very poorly soluble in aqueous solutions and not easily accessible to coupling as it contains only phenolic groups as potential coupling sites. For these reasons only few imaging studies using curcumin bound as an ester were performed and curcumin is mainly used as nutritional supplement.  Methods:   In the present study we produced an aminoethyl ether derivative of curcumin using a nucleophilic substitution reaction. This is a small modification and should not impact the properties of curcumin while introducing an easily accessible reactive amino group. This novel compound could be used to couple curcumin to other molecules using the standard methods of peptide synthesis. We studied the aminoethyl-curcumin compound and a tripeptide carrying this aminoethyl-curcumin and the fluorescent dye fluorescein (FITC-curcumin) in vitro on cell culture using confocal laser scanning microscopy and flow cytometry. Then these two substances were tested ex vivo on brain sections prepared from transgenic mice depicting Alzheimer-like β-amyloid plaques.  Results:   In the in vitro CLSM microscopy and flow cytometry experiments we found dot-like unspecific uptake and only slight cytotoxicity correlating with this uptake. As these measurements were optimized for the use of fluorescein as dye we found that the curcumin at 488nm fluorescence excitation was not strong enough to use it as a fluorescence marker in these applications. In the ex vivo sections CLSM experiments both the aminoethyl-curcumin and the FITC-curcumin peptide bound specifically to β- amyloid plaques.  Conclusion:   In conclusion we successfully produced a novel curcumin derivative which could easily be coupled to other imaging or therapeutic molecules as a sensor for amyloid plaques.""","""['Alexander Sturzu', 'Sumbla Sheikh', 'Hubert Kalbacher', 'Thomas Nägele', 'Christopher Weidenmaier', 'Bettina M Wegenast-Braun', 'Nadine Schilling', 'Ulrike Ernemann', 'Stefan Heckl']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Curr Alzheimer Res""","""[""A comparative study of dietary curcumin, nanocurcumin, and other classical amyloid-binding dyes for labeling and imaging of amyloid plaques in brain tissue of 5×-familial Alzheimer's disease mice."", 'Synthesis and evaluation of a (18)F-curcumin derivate for β-amyloid plaque imaging.', ""Development of fluorescent probes that bind and stain amyloid plaques in Alzheimer's disease."", 'Fluorescent Imaging of Amyloid-β Deposits in Brain: An Overview of Probe Development and a Highlight of the Applications for In Vivo Imaging.', ""PET imaging of amyloid in Alzheimer's disease."", 'Toward Regulatory Effects of Curcumin on Transforming Growth Factor-Beta Across Different Diseases: A Review.']"""

Illness uncertainty is a chronic stressor that impacts PC patients and their partners and, if left unmanaged, predicts decreased interpersonal functioning and quality of life (QOL) after treatment is complete. This study explored associations among psychosocial constructs, measured from both partners during the first year following a PC diagnosis, to better understand both partners' experiences and identify potential intervention targets for improving QOL.  Methods:   Couples (N = 165) in which one partner was undergoing treatment for PC were recruited from the Duke University Medical Center of Urology. Patients and their partners were surveyed at four time points: diagnosis and 1-, 6-, and 12-months post treatment. An Actor-Partner Interdependence Model (APIM) framework was used to examine associations among perceived partner support, nonsupportive behaviors, illness uncertainty, relationship satisfaction, and physical and mental QOL.  Results:   Partners feeling more supported at diagnosis was related to patients feeling more supported at 6 months. When patients' illness uncertainty decreased between diagnosis and 1 month, partners reported feeling more supported and engaging in fewer nonsupportive behaviors at 6-months post-treatment. Finally, partners' reports of support at 6 months predicted patients' 12-month ratings of physical and mental QOL and relationship satisfaction.

Our overarching aim is to exploit the inherent pro-apoptotic properties of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) through synergistic anti-tumor characteristics of resveratrol, with the aim of developing a new class of green nanotechnology-based phytochemical-embedded AuNPs for applications in oncology. Method: Resveratrol was used to reduce Au3+ to Au0 for the synthesis of Res-AuNPs at room temperature and gum arabic (GA) was used to further encapsulate the nanoparticulate surface to increase the overall stability of the AuNPs. This comprehensive study involves the synthesis, full characterization and in vitro stability of Res-AuNPs in various biological media for their ultimate applications as anti-cancer agents against human breast (MDAMB-231), pancreatic (PANC-1) and prostate (PC-3) cancers. Results: This strategy to systematically increase the corona of resveratrol on AuNPs, in order to gain insights into the interrelationship of the phytochemical corona on the overall anti-tumor activities of Res-AuNPs, proved successful. The increased resveratrol corona on Res-AuNPs showed superior anti-cancer effects, attributed to an optimal cellular uptake after 24-hour incubation, while GA provided a protein matrix support for enhanced trans-resveratrol loading onto the surface of the AuNPs. Conclusion: The approach described in this study harnesses the benefits of nutraceuticals and nanoparticles toward the development of Res-AuNPs. We provide compelling evidence that the increased corona of resveratrol on AuNPs enhances the bioavailability of resveratrol so that therapeutically active species can be optimally available in vivo for applications in cancer therapy.""","""['Velaphi C Thipe', 'Kiandohkt Panjtan Amiri', 'Pierce Bloebaum', 'Alice Raphael Karikachery', 'Menka Khoobchandani', 'Kavita K Katti', 'Silvia S Jurisson', 'Kattesh V Katti']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Int J Nanomedicine""","""['Antibacterial nanocarriers of resveratrol with gold and silver nanoparticles.', 'Novel biosynthesized gold nanoparticles as anti-cancer agents against breast cancer: Synthesis, biological evaluation, molecular modelling studies.', 'Optimization of anti-cancer drugs and a targeting molecule on multifunctional gold nanoparticles.', 'Green Synthesis of Gold Nanoparticles Using Plant Extracts as Beneficial Prospect for Cancer Theranostics.', 'Biomedical Applications of DNA-Conjugated Gold Nanoparticles.', 'Recent Progress in Nanotechnology Improving the Therapeutic Potential of Polyphenols for Cancer.', 'Current Understanding of Flavonoids in Cancer Therapy and Prevention.', 'Potential of resveratrol in the treatment of interstitial lung disease.', 'Phytochemical-based nanodrugs going beyond the state-of-the-art in cancer management-Targeting cancer stem cells in the framework of predictive, preventive, personalized medicine.', ""Brain targeting based nanocarriers loaded with resveratrol in Alzheimer's disease: A review.""]"""

Methods:   We analysed publicly available data of human prostate cancer for linear correlation between macrophage markers and glycolysis genes. We used zwitterionic buffers to adjust the pH in series of in vitro experiments. We then utilised subcutaneous and transgenic tumour models developed in C57BL/6 mice as well as computer simulations to correlate tumour progression with macrophage infiltration and to delineate role of acidity.  Results:   Activating macrophages at pH 6.8 in vitro enhanced an IL-4-driven phenotype as measured by gene expression, cytokine profiling, and functional assays. These results were recapitulated in vivo wherein neutralising intratumoural acidity reduced the pro-tumour phenotype of macrophages, while also decreasing tumour incidence and invasion in the TRAMP model of prostate cancer. These results were recapitulated using an in silico mathematical model that simulate macrophage responses to environmental signals.

In the present study, we investigated the contribution of erythropoietin signaling pathway to castration-resistant prostate cancer and the development of a neuroendocrine phenotype. Immunohistochemical staining showed that the erythropoietin and erythropoietin receptor scores in castration-resistant prostate cancer and androgen-dependent prostate cancer were 7.55 versus 4.5 and 7.45 versus 5.9,respectively (P < 0.001). Furthermore, a cell proliferation assay was conducted, and the differential expression of erythropoietin and erythropoietin receptor in LNCaP cells and hypoxia-induced LNCaP cells was evaluated using western blot and quantitative real-time PCR. The proliferation capacity of hypoxia-induced LNCaP cells was similar in cultures of both fetal bovine serum and charcoal-stripped fetal bovine serum, suggesting that LNCaP cells acquired hypoxia-induced androgen-independent growth. After 2 weeks of hypoxic culture, LNCaP cells showed a neuroendocrine cell change and increased expression of neuron-specific enolase, erythropoietin, and erythropoietin receptor; knockdown of erythropoietin receptor reversed the hypoxia-induced upregulation of neuron-specific enolase in the LNCaP cells. In conclusion, the concurrent upregulation of erythropoietin and erythropoietin receptor in castration-resistant prostate cancer suggests that the erythropoietin/erythropoietin receptor autocrine loop plays an important role in the progression of castration resistance and is responsible for the development of a neuroendocrine phenotype.""","""['Chen Ye', 'Guang-Hua Chen', 'Xin Chen', 'Sheng-Fei Qin', 'Min-Feng Shi', 'Tie Zhou']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Asian J Androl""","""['Erythropoietin and erythropoietin receptor expression in human prostate cancer.', 'Galectin-3 Is Implicated in Tumor Progression and Resistance to Anti-androgen Drug Through Regulation of Androgen Receptor Signaling in Prostate Cancer.', 'The hippo pathway effector YAP regulates motility, invasion, and castration-resistant growth of prostate cancer cells.', 'RGS2 is prognostic for development of castration resistance and cancer-specific survival in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Bad neighbours: hypoxia and genomic instability in prostate cancer.', 'Pan-Cancer Analysis Based on EPOR Expression With Potential Value in Prognosis and Tumor Immunity in 33 Tumors.']"""

Temporal trends and multivariable Cox regression analyses assessed OCM at 5 years using stratification according to year of diagnosis (1987-1991 vs. 1992-1996 vs. 1997-2001 vs. 2002-2006 vs. 2007-2011), age group, and ethnicity.

The increasing use of whole slide digital scanners has led to an enormous interest in the application of machine learning techniques to histopathological image classification. Here we introduce a novel family of morphological descriptors which, extracted in the appropriate image space and combined with shallow and deep Gaussian process based classifiers, improves early prostate cancer diagnosis.  Method:   We decompose the acquired RGB image in its RGB and optical density hematoxylin and eosin components. Then, we define two novel granulometry-based descriptors which work in both, RGB and optical density, spaces but perform better when used on the latter. In this space they clearly encapsulate knowledge used by pathologists to identify cancer lesions. The obtained features become the inputs to shallow and deep Gaussian process classifiers which achieve an accurate prediction of cancer.  Results:   We have used a real and unique dataset. The dataset is composed of 60 Whole Slide Images. For a five fold cross validation, shallow and deep Gaussian Processes obtain area under ROC curve values higher than 0.98. They outperform current state of the art patch based shallow classifiers and are very competitive to the best performing deep learning method. Models were also compared on 17 Whole Slide test Images using the FROC curve. With the cost of one false positive, the best performing method, the one layer Gaussian process, identifies 83.87% (sensitivity) of all annotated cancer in the Whole Slide Image. This result corroborates the quality of the extracted features, no more than a layer is needed to achieve excellent generalization results.  Conclusion:   Two new descriptors to extract morphological features from histological images have been proposed. They collect very relevant information for cancer detection. From these descriptors, shallow and deep Gaussian Processes are capable of extracting the complex structure of prostate histological images. The new space/descriptor/classifier paradigm outperforms state-of-art shallow classifiers. Furthermore, despite being much simpler, it is competitive to state-of-art CNN architectures both on the proposed SICAPv1 database and on an external database.""","""['Ángel E Esteban', 'Miguel López-Pérez', 'Adrián Colomer', 'María A Sales', 'Rafael Molina', 'Valery Naranjo']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Comput Methods Programs Biomed""","""['Blind color deconvolution, normalization, and classification of histological images using general super Gaussian priors and Bayesian inference.', 'Going deeper through the Gleason scoring scale: An automatic end-to-end system for histology prostate grading and cribriform pattern detection.', 'Generating region proposals for histopathological whole slide image retrieval.', 'A review of image analysis and machine learning techniques for automated cervical cancer screening from pap-smear images.', 'Role of AI and Histopathological Images in Detecting Prostate Cancer: A Survey.', 'An update on computational pathology tools for genitourinary pathology practice: A review paper from the Genitourinary Pathology Society (GUPS).', 'Cultivating Clinical Clarity through Computer Vision: A Current Perspective on Whole Slide Imaging and Artificial Intelligence.', 'A multi-resolution model for histopathology image classification and localization with multiple instance learning.']"""

This integration is achieved through logical rules that describe the association between genes, proteins, and reactions (GPRs). However, current gene-to-reaction formulation lacks the stoichiometry describing the transcript copies necessary to generate an active catalytic unit, which limits our understanding of how genes modulate metabolism. The present work introduces a new state-of-the-art GPR formulation that considers the stoichiometry of the transcripts (S-GPR). As case of concept, this novel gene-to-reaction formulation was applied to investigate the metabolic effects of the chronic exposure to Aldrin, an endocrine disruptor, on DU145 prostate cancer cells. To this aim we integrated the transcriptomic data from Aldrin-exposed and non-exposed DU145 cells through S-GPR or GPR into a human GSMM by applying different constraint-based-methods.  Results:   Our study revealed a significant improvement of metabolite consumption/production predictions when S-GPRs are implemented. Furthermore, our computational analysis unveiled important alterations in carnitine shuttle and prostaglandine biosynthesis in Aldrin-exposed DU145 cells that is supported by bibliographic evidences of enhanced malignant phenotype.  Conclusions:   The method developed in this work enables a more accurate integration of gene expression data into model-driven methods.

TAMs re-education has been proposed as a strategy to promote tumor inhibition. However, whether this approach may work in prostate cancer is unknown. Here we find that Pten-null prostate tumors are strongly infiltrated by TAMs expressing C-X-C chemokine receptor type 2 (CXCR2), and activation of this receptor through CXCL2 polarizes macrophages toward an anti-inflammatory phenotype. Notably, pharmacological blockade of CXCR2 receptor by a selective antagonist promoted the re-education of TAMs toward a pro-inflammatory phenotype.

This study aims to investigate the antiproliferative activity and potential mechanism of action of the xanthoquinodin JBIR-99, isolated from fungi Parengyodontium album MEXU 30,054 and identified by single-crystal X-ray crystallography. Cytotoxicity of xanthoquinodin was evaluated in a panel of human cancer cells lines and CCD-112-CoN normal colon cells, using the sulforhodamine B assay. PC-3 prostate cancer cells were used in biochemical assays including cell cycle, mitochondrial transmembrane potential (MTP), reactive oxygen species (ROS) and caspase activity. Expression levels of apoptosis-pathway-related proteins were analyzed by Western blot. The in vivo toxicity of xanthoquinodin was determined using a zebrafish model. Xanthoquinodin showed cytotoxicity in all cancer cell lines but demonstrated relative selective potency against PC-3 cells with an IC50 1.7 μM. In CCD-112-CoN cells, xanthoquinodin was non-cytotoxic at 100 μM. In PC-3 cells, the compound induced loss of MTP, production of ROS, and cell cycle arrest in S phase. The expression and activity of caspase-3 was increased, which correlates with the upregulation of Cyt c, Bax, nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-κB) (p65) and IKKβ, and downregulation of poly ADP ribose polymerase (PARP-1) and Bcl-2. Lastly, xanthoquinodin did not cause any visible developmental toxicity in zebrafish at 50 μM. These results demonstrate xanthoquinodin induces apoptosis in PC-3 prostate cancer cells by activation of both intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic pathways. In addition, the non-toxic effect in vivo indicates that xanthoquinodin could be a useful lead in the development of a novel, anti-cancer agent that is selective for prostate cancer.""","""['Gerardo D Anaya-Eugenio', 'Daniela Rebollar-Ramos', 'Maria Del Carmen González', 'Huzefa Raja', 'Rachel Mata', 'Esperanza J Carcache de Blanco']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Chem Biol Interact""","""['Caspase-Dependent Apoptosis in Prostate Cancer Cells and Zebrafish by Corchorusoside C from Streptocaulon juventas.', 'Apoptosis induction of human prostate carcinoma cells by cordycepin through reactive oxygen species‑mediated mitochondrial death pathway.', 'Salinomycin-induced apoptosis of human prostate cancer cells due to accumulated reactive oxygen species and mitochondrial membrane depolarization.', 'Stingless Bee Propolis: New Insights for Anticancer Drugs.', 'Programmed cell death and survival pathways in prostate cancer cells.', 'Molecular Basis of Prostate Cancer and Natural Products as Potential Chemotherapeutic and Chemopreventive Agents.', 'The use of zebrafish model in prostate cancer therapeutic development and discovery.', 'Seven New Cytotoxic and Antimicrobial Xanthoquinodins from Jugulospora vestita.', 'Parengyodontium album Isolated from Cutaneous Lesions of a Pacific White-Sided Dolphin (Lagenorhynchus obliquidens) During Treatment for Paracoccidioidomycosis Ceti.']"""

However, it remains unknown whether DA is an adverse prognostic factor in metastatic PCa (mPCa).  Method:   Data from 634 mPCa patients histopathologically documented with DA or/and acinar adenocarcinoma of the prostate in our center between 2012 and 2018 were retrospectively analyzed. Propensity score matching (PSM) was used to balance the baseline features. Data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database were utilized to validate our findings. Castration-resistant PCa-free survival (CFS), overall survival (OS), and cancer-specific survival (CSS) were set as endpoints.  Results:   DA was confirmed in 35 of 634 (5.5%) patients. Among the DA-positive patients, 7 of 35 (20%) and 28 of 35 (80%) harbored high (DA ≥ 50%) and low (DA < 50%) DA components, respectively.

This study investigates the unique roles of canonical WNT10B in both normal prostate development and prostate cancer (PCa) progression.  Methods:   Organ culture and rat ventral prostates (VPs) were used to study Wnt10b ontogeny and growth effect of WNT10B protein. PB-SV40 LTag rat VPs were utilized for Wnt expression polymerase chain reaction (PCR) array and immunohistochemistry. Human localized PCa tissue microarrays (TMAs) were investigated for differential WNT10B expression. Human RNA-seq data sets were queried for differential expression of WNT10B in metastatic and localized PCa. Knockdown of WNT10B in PC3 cells was utilized to study its effects on proliferation, stemness, epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT), and xenograft propagation.  Results:   Wnt10b expression was highest at birth and rapidly declined in the postnatal rat VP. Exogenous WNT10B addition to culture developing VPs decreased growth suggesting an antiproliferative role. VPs from PB-SV40 LTag rats with localized PCa showed a 25-fold reduction in Wnt10b messenger RNA (mRNA) expession, confirmed at the protein level. Human PCa TMAs revealed elevated WNT10B protein in prostate intraepithelial neoplasia compared with normal prostates but reduced levels in localized PCa specimens. In contrast, RNA-seq data set of annotated human PCa metastasis found a significant increase in WNT10B mRNA expression compared with localized tumors suggesting stage-specific functions of WNT10B. Similarly, WNT10B mRNA levels were increased in metastatic cell lines PC3, PC3M, as well as in HuSLC, a PCa stem-like cell line, as compared with disease-free primary prostate epithelial cells. WNT10B knockdown in PC3 cells reduced expression of EMT genes, MMP9 and stemness genes NANOG and SOX2 and markedly reduced the stem cell-like side population. Furthermore, loss of WNT10B abrogated the ability of PC3 cells to propagate tumors via serial transplantation.  Conclusions:   Taken together, these results suggest a dual role for WNT10B in normal development and in PCa progression with opposing functions depending on disease stage. We propose that decreased WNT10B levels in localized cancer allow for a hyperproliferative state, whereas increased levels in advanced disease confer a stemness and malignant propensity which is mitigated by knocking down WNT10B levels. This raises the potential for WNT10B as a novel target for therapeutic intervention in metastatic PCa.""","""['Ikenna Madueke', 'Wen-Yang Hu', 'Danping Hu', 'Steven M Swanson', 'Donald Vander Griend', 'Michael Abern', 'Gail S Prins']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['The role of WNT10B in physiology and disease: A 10-year update.', 'SNAI1 is critical for the aggressiveness of prostate cancer cells with low E-cadherin.', 'The involvement of FBP1 in prostate cancer cell epithelial mesenchymal transition, invasion and metastasis by regulating the MAPK signaling pathway.', 'Genes upregulated in prostate cancer reactive stroma promote prostate cancer progression in vivo.', 'Cancer Stemness/Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition Axis Influences Metastasis and Castration Resistance in Prostate Cancer: Potential Therapeutic Target.', 'The role of WNT10B in physiology and disease: A 10-year update.', 'Adaptive and non-adaptive gene expression responses in prostate cancer during androgen deprivation.', 'Paracrine Wnt signaling is necessary for prostate epithelial proliferation.', 'Morphometric Analysis of Rat Prostate Development: Roles of MEK/ERK and Rho Signaling Pathways in Prostatic Morphogenesis.', 'A Review of Prostate Organogenesis and a Role for iPSC-Derived Prostate Organoids to Study Prostate Development and Disease.']"""

In this study, membrane-initiated estrogen signaling was interrogated in human prostate stem/progenitor cells enriched from primary epithelial cultures and stem-like cell lines from benign and cancerous prostates. Subcellular fractionation and proximity ligation assays localized ERα and ERβ to the cell membrane with caveolin-1 interactions. Exposure to 17β-estradiol (E2) for 15 to 60 minutes led to sequential phosphorylation of signaling molecules in MAPK and AKT pathways, IGF1 receptor, epidermal growth factor receptor, and ERα, thus documenting an intact membrane signalosome that activates diverse downstream cascades. Treatment with an E2-dendrimer conjugate or ICI 182,870 validated E2-mediated actions through membrane ERs. Overexpression and knockdown of ERα or ERβ in stem/progenitor cells identified pathway selectivity; ERα preferentially activated AKT, whereas ERβ selectively activated MAPK cascades. Furthermore, prostate cancer stem-like cells expressed only ERβ, and brief E2 exposure activated MAPK but not AKT cascades. A gene subset selectively regulated by nongenomic E2 signaling was identified in normal prostate progenitor cells that includes BGN, FOSB, FOXQ1, and MAF. Membrane-initiated E2 signaling rapidly modified histone methyltransferases, with MLL1 cleavage observed downstream of phosphorylated AKT and EZH2 phosphorylation downstream of MAPK signaling, which may jointly modify histones to permit rapid gene transcription. Taken together, the present findings document ERα and ERβ membrane-initiated signaling in normal and cancerous human prostate stem/progenitor cells with differential engagement of downstream effectors. These signaling pathways influence normal prostate stem/progenitor cell homeostasis and provide novel therapeutic sites to target the elusive prostate cancer stem cell population.""","""['Shyama Majumdar', 'Jaqueline C Rinaldi', 'Neha R Malhotra', 'Lishi Xie', 'Dan-Ping Hu', 'Timothy D Gauntner', 'Harinder S Grewal', 'Wen-Yang Hu', 'Sung Hoon Kim', 'John A Katzenellenbogen', 'Susan Kasper', 'Gail S Prins']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Endocrinology""","""['Estrogen receptors localization and signaling pathways in DU-145 human prostate cancer cells.', 'Resveratrol and estradiol rapidly activate MAPK signaling through estrogen receptors alpha and beta in endothelial cells.', 'Expression and regulation of the estrogen receptors in PC-3 human prostate cancer cells.', 'Membrane association of estrogen receptor alpha and beta influences 17beta-estradiol-mediated cancer cell proliferation.', 'The extra-nuclear interactome of the estrogen receptors: implications for physiological functions.', 'Visualization of the protein-protein interactions of hormone receptors in hormone-dependent cancer research.', 'Membrane estrogen receptor α signaling modulates the sensitivity to estradiol treatment in a dose- and tissue- dependent manner.', ""The emerging role of estrogen's non-nuclear signaling in the cardiovascular disease."", 'Therapeutic Targeting of Ovarian Cancer Stem Cells Using Estrogen Receptor Beta Agonist.', 'EZH2 Mediates Proliferation, Migration, and Invasion Promoted by Estradiol in Human Glioblastoma Cells.']"""

Results:   Our results showed that PDE5 is barely expressed in the epithelial or stromal compartment of normal human prostates, but it is highly expressed in the stromal compartment of BPH sections. We also found that a low but significant number of PCa samples (22%) expressed PDE5 in the epithelial cancer cells but not in stromal cells and that such expression was not correlated with the tumor aggressiveness, according to their Gleason score.  Discussion and conclusion:   PDE5 overexpression in the stromal compartment of BPH samples supports the rationale of PDE5 as a target in lower urinary tract symptoms of BPH.

The current study was designed to elucidate the pivotal factors involved in PCa occurrence and development.  Methods:   We performed RNA sequencing on the prostate tumor and adjacent normal tissues from Chinese PCa patients. Genes identified via genome-wide expression profile analysis were validated by quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry. Hypermethylation of CpG islands was assessed by nested methylation-specific PCR. Whole genome microarray analysis was performed using an Affymetrix GeneChip.  Results:   We identified nine possible abnormally expressed genes (P < .05) and then revealed TWIST2 as having strikingly lower expression in tumors than in control tissues (P < .01). Low messenger RNA expression levels of TWIST2 were associated with hypermethylation of CpG islands in its promoter region. In accordance with these findings, PCa tumor tissues showed markedly decreased TWIST2 protein expression compared to that in both normal and prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia tissues by immunohistochemical staining. Ectopic expression of TWIST2 in LNCap cells not only inhibited cell proliferation and colony formation in vitro and tumor growth in vivo but also induced transcriptional repression of a cell proliferation-related gene cohort, including androgen receptor signaling mediators, cyclins, homeobox genes, forkhead box genes, and SOX2.

At a dose of apalutamide 240 mg/day, apalutamide and N-desmethyl-apalutamide exposure exhibited 5.3- and 85.2-fold accumulation in plasma, respectively. Inter-individual variability in apalutamide apparent clearance is low (< 20%). Among the covariates evaluated, apalutamide and N-desmethyl-apalutamide exposure were statistically associated only with health status, body weight, and albumin concentration, and the effect was low (< 25%).

Transcriptome and PAR-CLIP analyses revealed that SF3B2 controls the splicing of target genes, including AR, to drive aggressive phenotypes. SF3B2-mediated aggressive phenotypes in vivo were reversed by AR-V7 knockout. Pladienolide B, an inhibitor of a splicing modulator of the SF3b complex, suppressed the growth of tumors addicted to high SF3B2 expression. These findings support the idea that alteration of the splicing pattern by high SF3B2 expression is one mechanism underlying prostate cancer progression and therapeutic resistance. This study also provides evidence supporting SF3B2 as a candidate therapeutic target for treating patients with cancer.

We propose the use of autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models in conjunction with population forecasts to provide for robust annual projections of prostate cancer.  Design:   Data on the incidence and mortality from prostate cancer was obtained from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare. We formulated several ARIMA models with different autocorrelation terms and chose one which provided for an accurate fit of the data based on the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE). We also assessed the model for external validity. A similar process was used to model age-standardised incidence and mortality rate for prostate cancer in Australia during the same time period.  Results:   The annual number of prostate cancer cases diagnosed in Australia increased from 3606 in 1982 to 20 065 in 2012. There were two peaks observed around 1994 and 2009. Among the various models evaluated, we found that the model with an autoregressive term of 1 (coefficient=0.45, p=0.028) as well as differencing the series provided the best fit, with a MAPE of 5.2%. External validation showed a good MAPE of 5.8% as well. We project prostate cancer incident cases in 2022 to rise to 25 283 cases (95% CI: 23 233 to 27 333).

If the setting for RC use differs from that in which it was developed, there is a risk of making clinical decisions based on incorrect estimates of the absolute risk. The ERSPC-MRI RC predicts clinically significant prostate cancer (csPC; Gleason ≥ 3 + 4) on targeted and systematic biopsy using information on PSA, digital rectal examination, prostate volume, age, previous negative biopsy, and Prostate Imaging-Recording and Data System score. This calculator was developed on a clinical cohort of 961 men (2012-2017) with a csPC prevalence of 36%. Discrimination was good (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve 0.84). With the increasing use of multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging, we foresee that this RC will also be used for men with a lower a priori likelihood of PC. We investigated the effect of such a scenario on individual risk predictions. A small update of the intercept for the calculator can restore the accuracy to support decision-making with locally valid risk estimates. PATIENT SUMMARY: Decisions on who to refer for a prostate biopsy with its risk of sepsis and overdiagnosis require more than a prostate-specific antigen test.

The optimal methodology for contouring of GTV using Prostate specific membrane antigen positron emission tomography (PSMA-PET) information has not yet been defined.  Methods and materials:   PCa patients who underwent a [68Ga]PSMA-11-PET/CT followed by radical prostatectomy were prospectively enrolled (n = 20). Six observer teams with different levels of experience and using different PET image scaling techniques performed manual contouring of GTV. Additionally, semi-automatic segmentation of GTVs was performed using SUVmax thresholds of 20-50%. Coregistered histopathological gross tumor volume (GTV-Histo) served as reference. Inter-observer agreement was assessed by calculating the Dice similarity coefficient (DSC).  Results:   Most contouring methods provided high sensitivity and specificity. For manual delineation, scaling the PET images from SUVmin-max: 0-5 resulted in high sensitivity (>86%). The highest specificity (100%) was obtained by scaling the PET images from SUVmin-max: 0-SUVmax. High interobserver agreement (median DSC 0.8) was observed when using the same PET image scaling technique (PET images SUVmin-max: 0-5). For semi-automatic segmentation, a low SUVmax threshold of 20% optimized sensitivity (SUVmax threshold 20%, 100% sensitivity, 32% of prostatic volume), whereas a higher threshold optimized specificity (SUVmax threshold 40%-50%, 100% specificity).  Conclusions:   Contouring of regions with high tracer-uptake resulted in very high specificities and should be used for biopsy guidance.

Methods:   Proton boost of 20 Gy given in 4 daily fractions to the prostate was followed after a one-week rest by photon therapy to 50 Gy in 2 Gy fractions. Outcomes are presented per risk group according to both NCCN and ISUP classifications. Advanced imaging was performed for adequate staging, and at an early stage of rising PSA, to identify the relapse site. Endpoints were PSA relapse-free-, locoregional relapse-free-, and distant metastasis-free- survival. Prostate cancer-specific-, metastasis-free-, and overall survival were also estimated. Genitourinary (GU) and gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity were based on patients' questionnaires and physicians' records.  Results:   We treated 531 patients between 2002 and 2015; 504 had localized disease. The cohort included 180 patients with T3/T4 disease (36%). The majority of the 50% with high-/very high-risk disease received ADT, 9-24 months; 92 had adjuvant pelvic node treatment. Median follow-up was 113 months (43-193). For low-, intermediate-, high-, and very high-risk patients, the 5-year PSA relapse-free survival was 100%, 94%, 82%, and 72%, respectively. Prolonged ADT improved biochemical control and nodal treatment regional control. The NCCN classification had higher predictive discrimination than the ISUP classification. The 5-year prevalence grade 3+ was 2% for GU and 0% for GI toxicity in pre-treatment symptom-free patients, and not worsened by nodal treatment.  Conclusion:   Dose escalation with hypofractionated proton boost was as effective as reported with high dose-rate brachytherapy boost, and the GU and GI toxicity profile was very similar.

Nowadays, multiparametric MRI (mpMRI) is routinely used for gross tumor volume (GTV) delineation. The aim of our study was to compare PSMA-PET/CT and mpMRI for the delineation of intraprostatic tumor burden by using whole mount histopathology as a reference standard.  Material and methods:   17 prospectively enrolled patients with primary PCa underwent [68Ga-]PSMA-11 PET/CT and mpMRI before radical prostatectomy. PSMA-PET/CT, mpMRI and histopathology of the resected specimens were co-registered. Two teams of experts generated GTV contours for mpMRI and PET, respectively. The imaging was validated on a lesion level and slice by slice in quadrants based on the distribution of PCa in histopathology. Overall, 772 quadrants were analyzed with 414 being true positive for tumor (53.6%).  Results:   Median tumor volumes were 10.4 ml for GTV-histo, 10.8 ml for PSMA-PET and 4.5 ml for mpMRI. Median tumor volume in mpMRI was significant (p < 0.05) smaller than GTV-PET and GTV-histo, respectively. The sensitivity and specificity were 86% and 87% for PSMA-PET, 58% and 94% for mpMRI and 91% and 84% for their GTV-union. In 133 quadrants PSMA-PET/CT correctly identified tumor where mpMRI found none. MpMRI identified 19 true positive quadrants exclusively.  Conclusion:   Our investigation demonstrates an increased consensus of PSMA-PET with histopathology compared to mpMRI for intraprostatic GTV delineation, especially with a higher sensitivity. Additionally mpMRI contours underestimate tumor volume significantly.

While the oxygen atoms at the stem of the four arms of the DOTA scaffold are needed for metal chelation, we previously introduced various physiochemical properties to extend these arms in a chemical library fashion to enhance the imaging contrast mechanism. We developed two such on-bead libraries, with 80 and 76 DOTA derivatives, where one arm was used to attach the DOTA scaffold onto resin beads and the other three arms were chemically modified. We now hypothesized that the chemical moieties used to modify these three arms can also recognize biomarkers on a cell surface. Therefore in this current study, we used such 76 derivatives of DOTA library to screen against HeLa cervical cancer cells. We found that two of the four 'hits' identified displayed higher binding towards HeLa cells than the unmodified parent DOTA. Furthermore, one of those 'hits' displayed better binding towards cervical and prostate cancer cells than lung and breast cancer cells and normal HBEC-3KT and RWPE1 cells. This indicates that this derivative can recognize a biomarker specific for certain types of cancer cells. If the compound has intrinsic activity, this can be used as a theranostic agent for real time therapy monitoring applications in the future. We believe that our DOTA derivative-based library approach can be applied to other types of cell and protein screens on various disease types in the future.""","""['Vineeta Rustagi', 'D Gomika Udugamasooriya']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Bioorg Med Chem Lett""","""['A facile on-bead method for fully symmetric tetra-substituted DOTA derivatizations using peptoid moieties.', 'Development of a large peptoid-DOTA combinatorial library.', 'A Metal-Free DOTA-Conjugated 18F-Labeled Radiotracer: 18FDOTA-AMBF3-LLP2A for Imaging VLA-4 Over-Expression in Murine Melanoma with Improved Tumor Uptake and Greatly Enhanced Renal Clearance.', 'The synthesis and chelation chemistry of DOTA-peptide conjugates.', 'The ubiquitous DOTA and its derivatives: the impact of 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7,10-tetraacetic acid on biomedical imaging.', 'A novel peptidomimetic therapeutic for selective suppression of lung cancer stem cells over non-stem cancer cells.']"""

Using prostate specific antigen (PSA) and prostate cancer antigen 3 (PCA3) in the diagnosis of prostate cancer, sensitivity and specificity still require improvement. Additional targets are urgently needed for the diagnosis, prognosis, and prediction of therapeutic response, leading to better treatments in order to reduce the mortality of CaP. Here, we utilized a solid-phase antibody array, which can simultaneously detect 200 proteins, for the screening of novel blood-based biomarkers. The proteins differentially expressed in the pathogenesis of CaP were further analyzed using bioinformatics methods. The identified targets were further validated by the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). A total of 38 proteins were identified with significantly differential levels in CaP serum compared to healthy control serum, including 21 up-regulated and 17 down-regulated cytokines. ELISA result showed that validated six ones of these differential cytokines were significantly differential between CaP and control, consistent with the antibody array result. The protein-protein interaction (PPI) analysis for these differentially expressed cytokines showed the top five cytokines interacting with most other cytokines were insulin, SDF-1a, CD40L, IL-18 and NCAM-1, suggesting these five targets are important in the pathogenesis of CaP, and more sensitive for the early diagnosis and prognosis of CaP. Targeting these cytokines may be more effective therapies against CaP. Among these differentially expressed cytokines, it was found that AR, BTC, IL-1 F8, IL-31, Marapsin, b-NGF, EDA-A2, MCP-3, MCP-4, MIP-3a, PIGF, and TECK decreased, while Fas, Flt-3L, and NCAM-1 increased in CaP when compared to the controls.

Patients and methods:   We evaluated 126 patients who underwent salvage RALPbetween 2008 and 2018. Of these, 94 (74.6%) received radiation and 32 focal ablation (25.4%) as primary therapy. These groups were compared with regard to clinical, oncological and functional outcomes. Kaplan-Meier curves and regression models were used to identify survival estimations and their predictors.  Results:   Before surgery, more patients were potent in the focal ablation group compared to the radiation group (46.9% vs 22.6%; P = 0.013). Peri-operative characteristics and complication rates were not significantly different between the two groups. Postoperative catheterization duration was shorter in the focal ablation group (mean 10 vs 16 days; P = 0.018). At final pathology, the focal ablation group had higher non-organ-confined disease (71% vs 50%; P = 0.042) and positive surgical margin (PSM) rates (43.8% vs 17%; P = 0.004) as compared to the radiation group; however, 5-year biochemical recurrence (BCR)-free survival rates were similar (59% vs 56%; P = 0.761). Postoperative 1-year full (no pads/day) and social (0-1 pad/day) continence rates were significantly higher in the focal ablation as compared to the radiation group (77.3% vs 39.2%, P = 0.002, and 87.5% vs 51.3%, P = 0.002, respectively). Multivariate analyses showed primary focal ablation and nerve-sparing to be predictors of postoperative continence. Erectile function was preserved in 13% and 27% of preoperatively potent patients in the radiation and focal ablation groups, respectively (P = 0.435).

Materials and methods:   We identified 302 men in the SEARCH (Shared Equal Access Regional Cancer Hospital) database who received androgen deprivation therapy after radical prostatectomy for nonmetastatic disease, had never received statins before androgen deprivation therapy and had available serum lipid data within 2 years prior to androgen deprivation therapy. Cox proportional hazards models were used to test associations between total cholesterol (less than 200 vs 200 mg/dl or greater), low density lipoprotein (less than 130 vs 130 mg/dl or greater), high density lipoprotein (40 or greater vs less than 40 mg/dl) and triglycerides (less than 150 vs 150 mg/dl or greater) and the risk of castration resistant prostate cancer and metastasis after androgen deprivation therapy while adjusting for potential confounders. Subanalyses were restricted to men who remained statin nonusers after androgen deprivation therapy.  Results:   Median followup after androgen deprivation therapy was 67 months. Castration resistant prostate cancer and metastasis developed in 42 and 44 men, respectively. Men with elevated cholesterol received androgen deprivation therapy in an earlier year and had longer followup and a higher rate of statin use after androgen deprivation therapy. On multivariable analysis total cholesterol and low density lipoprotein were unrelated to castration resistant prostate cancer. Low high density lipoprotein (less than 40 vs 40 mg/dl or greater) was suggestively linked to an increased risk of castration resistant prostate cancer (HR 1.86, 95% CI 0.99-3.48). The association was stronger in men who remained statin nonusers after androgen deprivation therapy (HR 3.64, 95% CI 1.45-9.17). Results for metastasis were similar to those for castration resistant prostate cancer.  Conclusions:   Among men with nonmetastatic prostate cancer who started androgen deprivation therapy serum cholesterol was unrelated to castration resistant prostate cancer or metastasis. Low high density lipoprotein was suggestively associated with risks of increased castration resistant prostate cancer and metastasis, particularly in statin never users.

Caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE) is the main component of honey bee propolis. We determined if CAPE affects the signaling and stability of AR in PCa cells.  Methods:   Effects of CAPE on AR transcriptional activity and localization were determined by reporter gene assay and immunofluorescent microscopy. Western blotting, fluorescent polarization, computer simulation, and animal experiment were performed to investigate the molecular mechanism how CAPE reduces the stability of AR.  Results:   CAPE treatment dose-dependently suppressed the transcriptional activity of AR as well as the protein levels of AR and its target gene PSA. Cyclohexamide treatment revealed that androgen stabilized AR protein, but AR stability was diminished by CAPE. Fluorescence microscopy demonstrated that androgen promoted the nucleus translocation of AR in PCa cells, while treatment with CAPE reduced protein level of AR in both nucleus and cytoplasm. CAPE treatment suppressed the phosphorylation of Ser81 and Ser213 on AR, which regulates the stability of AR. CDK1 and AKT are the kinases phosphorylating Ser81 and Ser213 on AR, respectively. CAPE treatment significantly reduced the protein level and activity of CDK1 and AKT in PCa cells. Overexpression of CDK1 or AKT rescued the AR protein level under CAPE treatment.

Procedures:   Under IND 133,222 and an IRB-approved research protocol, we evaluated the biodistribution and pharmacokinetics of [68Ga]Ga-P16-093 with serial PET imaging following intravenous administration to ten prostate cancer patients with biochemical recurrence. The recruited subjects were all patients in whom a recent [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 PET/X-ray computed tomography (CT) exam had been independently performed under IND 131,806 to assist in decision-making with regard to their clinical care. Voided urine was collected from each subject at ~ 60 min and ~ 140 min post-[68Ga]Ga-P16-093 injection and assayed for Ga-68 content. Following image segmentation to extract tissue time-activity curves and corresponding cumulated activity values, radiation dosimetry estimates were calculated using IDAC Dose 2.1. The prior [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT exam (whole-body PET imaging at 60 min post-injection, performed with contrast-enhanced diagnostic CT) served as a reference scan for comparison to the [68Ga]Ga-P16-093 findings.  Results:   [68Ga]Ga-P16-093 PET images at 60 min post-injection provided diagnostic information that appeared equivalent to the subject's prior [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 scan. With both radiopharmaceuticals, sites of tumor recurrence were found in eight of the ten patients, identifying 16 lesions. The site of recurrence was not detected with either agent for the other two subjects. Bladder activity was consistently lower with [68Ga]Ga-P16-093 than [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11. The kidneys, spleen, salivary glands, and liver receive the highest radiation exposure from [68Ga]Ga-P16-093, with estimated doses of 1.7 × 10-1, 6.7 × 10-2, 6.5 × 10-2, and 5.6 × 10-2 mGy/MBq, respectively. The corresponding effective dose from [68Ga]Ga-P16-093 is 2.3 × 10-2 mSv/MBq.  Conclusions:   [68Ga]Ga-P16-093 provided diagnostic information that appeared equivalent to [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 in this limited series of ten prostate cancer patients presenting with biochemical recurrence, with the kidneys found to be the critical organ.

Iodine-125, the most commonly used isotope, may be associated with long-term urinary consequences. Cesium-131 (131Cs) has a higher dose rate and shorter dose delivery time, predicting a shorter duration of urinary morbidity. We report our institution's high-volume experience and the most mature data to date on outcomes with 131Cs prostate BT.  Methods and materials:   571 men (median age: 65.38 years) with low (55%)-, intermediate (36%)-, and high-risk disease (9%) received monobrachytherapy, dual-modality, or trimodality using 131Cs at a single institution. Risk groups were defined according to the National Comprehensive Cancer Network definition. Median prescription dose for definitive LDR-BT and LDR-BT boost was 115 Gy and 70 Gy, respectively. Median initial PSA was 6.1 ng/mL (IQR: 4.6-8.7).  Results:   Median followup time was 5 years. 5/7-year overall survival for low-, intermediate-, and high-risk patients was 96.9%/96/9%, 92.8%/89.7%, and 95.8%/87.1%, respectively (p = 0.02). 5/7-year freedom from biochemical failure for low-, intermediate-, and high-risk patients was 98.5%/96.3%, 94.1%/86.4%, and 93.2%/74.5%, respectively (p < 0.01). 5/7-year prostate cancer -specific survival was 100%/100%, 99.3%/99.3%, and 98.0%/98.0% for low-, intermediate-, and high-risk patients, respectively (p < 0.01).  Conclusions: 131Cs is a viable alternative isotope for prostate brachytherapy for organ-confined disease.

SABR delivers precise, high-dose, hypofractionated radiotherapy, and achieves excellent rates of local control for primary tumors or metastases. A recent randomized phase II trial evaluated SABR in a group of patients with a small burden of oligometastatic disease (mostly with 1-3 metastatic lesions), and found that SABR was associated with benefits in progression-free survival and overall survival. The goal of this phase III trial is to assess the impact of SABR in patients with 4-10 metastatic cancer lesions.  Methods:   One hundred and fifty-nine patients will be randomized in a 1:2 ratio between the control arm (consisting of standard of care palliative-intent treatments), and the SABR arm (consisting of standard of care treatment + SABR to all sites of known disease). Randomization will be stratified by two factors: histology (Group 1: prostate, breast, or renal; Group 2: all others), and type of pre-specified systemic therapy (Group 1: immunotherapy/targeted; Group 2: cytotoxic; Group 3: observation). SABR is to be completed within 2 weeks, allowing for rapid initiation of systemic therapy.

Here, we molecularly dissect the contribution of long non-coding RNA H19 to PCa metastatic potential under combined stimuli, a topic largely uncovered. The effects of estrogen and hypoxia on H19 and cell adhesion molecules' expression were investigated in PCa cells and PCa-derived organotypic slice cultures (OSCs) by qPCR and Western blot. The molecular mechanism was addressed by chromatin immunoprecipitations, overexpression, and silencing assays. PCa cells' metastatic potential was analyzed by in vitro cell-cell adhesion, motility test, and trans-well invasion assay. We found that combined treatment caused a significant H19 down-regulation as compared with hypoxia. In turn, H19 acts as a transcriptional repressor of cell adhesion molecules, as revealed by up-regulation of both β3 and β4 integrins and E-cadherin upon H19 silencing or combined treatment. Importantly, H19 down-regulation and β integrins induction were also observed in treated OSCs. Combined treatment increased both cell motility and invasion of PCa cells. Lastly, reduction of β integrins and invasion was achieved through epigenetic modulation of H19-dependent transcription.

Methods:   A maximal incremental exercise test and a 1-h steady-state test were performed just before and 3 months after robotic RP to determine maximal oxygen consumption (V˙O2max) and other cardiorespiratory variables. The patient recorded his training as he prepared for an endurance event that was to occur 3 months after RP, the Norwegian Foot March, a 30-km road march carrying 11.4 kg.  Results:   In the month before RP, the patient performed 2 to 3 h of vigorous-intensity aerobic exercise per week, fast walking carrying an 11.4-kg pack, with the longest individual session being a 16-km road march. Just before surgery, V˙O2max was 36.7 mL·min·kg, HR during 30 min at 7.2 km·h and 0% grade was 77% of HR reserve (HRR), and during 30 min at 5.3 km·h and 10% grade was 92% HRR. On postsurgery day 44, he did a 19-km road march carrying 11.4 kg, exceeding the training level of the month presurgery. Three months postsurgery, V˙O2max was 42.7 mL·min·kg, and HR during the flat and uphill 30-min sessions at the same absolute intensity as presurgery were 70% and 83% HRR, respectively. He completed the Norwegian Foot March 93 d postsurgery in 4:24:37, with an average HR of 72% HRR.  Conclusions:   This case study demonstrates that an aerobically trained prostate cancer patient can return to high-level aerobic training in as little as 7 wk post-RP, and even exceed presurgery fitness.

The aim of this study was to investigate whether p2PSA-derived biomarkers can assist in the prediction of aggressive pathological outcomes after radical prostatectomy (RP).  Methods:   We prospectively enrolled patients who were diagnosed with PCa and treated with RP between February 2017 and December 2018. Preoperative blood samples were analyzed for tPSA, free PSA (fPSA), percentage of fPSA (%fPSA), [-2]proPSA (p2PSA), and percentage of p2PSA (%p2PSA). Prostate health index (PHI) was calculated as (p2PSA/fPSA) × √tPSA. Prostate volume was determined by transrectal ultrasound using the ellipsoid formula, and PHI density was calculated as PHI/prostate volume. The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve were estimated for various PSA/p2PSA derivatives. Aggressive pathological outcomes measured after RP were defined as pathological T3 or a Gleason score (GS) >6 as determined in RP specimens.  Results:   One hundred and forty-four patients were included for analysis. Postoperative GS was >6 in 86.1% of the patients, and pT stage was T3a or more in 54.2%. Among all PSA- and p2PSA-derived biomarkers, PHI density was the best biomarker to predict aggressive pathological outcomes after RP. The odds ratio of having an aggressive pathological outcome of RP was 8.796 (p = 0.001). In multivariate analysis, adding %fPSA to base model did not improve the accuracy (area under curve), but adding PHI and PHI density to base model improved the accuracy by 2% and 16%, respectively, in predicting pT3 stage or GS ≥ 7. The risk of pT3 stage or GS ≥ 7 was 20.8% for PHI density <1.125, and 64.6% for PHI density >1.125 (sensitivity: 74.6% and specificity: 88.9%).  Conclusion:   PHI density may further aid in predicting aggressive pathological outcomes after RP. This biomarker may be useful in preoperative counseling and may have potential in decision making when choosing between definitive treatment and active surveillance of newly diagnosed PCa.""","""['Yu-Pin Huang', 'Tzu-Ping Lin', 'Wei-Ming Cheng', 'Tzu-Chun Wei', 'I-Shen Huang', 'Yu-Hua Fan', 'Chih-Chieh Lin', 'Eric Y H Huang', 'Hsiao-Jen Chung', 'Junne-Yih Kuo', 'Howard H H Wu', 'Shing-Hwa Lu', 'Yen-Hwa Chang', 'Alex T L Lin', 'William J S Huang']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""J Chin Med Assoc""","""['Erratum: Prostate health index density predicts aggressive pathological outcomes after radical prostatectomy in Taiwanese patients.', 'Preoperative Prostate-specific Antigen Isoform p2PSA and Its Derivatives, %p2PSA and Prostate Health Index, Predict Pathologic Outcomes in Patients Undergoing Radical Prostatectomy for Prostate Cancer: Results from a Multicentric European Prospective Study.', 'Preoperative prostate-specific antigen isoform p2PSA and its derivatives, %p2PSA and prostate health index, predict pathologic outcomes in patients undergoing radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer.', 'Prostate Health Index and %p2PSA Predict Aggressive Prostate Cancer Pathology in Chinese Patients Undergoing Radical Prostatectomy.', 'Clinical performance of serum -2proPSA derivatives, %p2PSA and PHI, in the detection and management of prostate cancer.', 'Clinical use of -2proPSA (p2PSA) and its derivatives (%p2PSA and Prostate Health Index) for the detection of prostate cancer: a review of the literature.', 'Comparison of Prostate-Specific Antigen and Its Density and Prostate Health Index and Its Density for Detection of Prostate Cancer.', 'Beyond Prostate Specific Antigen: New Prostate Cancer Screening Options.', 'Prostate Health Index Density Outperforms Prostate Health Index in Clinically Significant Prostate Cancer Detection.', 'Combining prostate health index and multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging in estimating the histological diameter of prostate cancer.']"""

However, automated prostate segmentation from 3D MR images faces several challenges. The lack of clear edge between the prostate and other anatomical structures makes it challenging to accurately extract the boundaries. The complex background texture and large variation in size, shape and intensity distribution of the prostate itself make segmentation even further complicated. Recently, as deep learning, especially convolutional neural networks (CNNs), emerging as the best performed methods for medical image segmentation, the difficulty in obtaining large number of annotated medical images for training CNNs has become much more pronounced than ever. Since large-scale dataset is one of the critical components for the success of deep learning, lack of sufficient training data makes it difficult to fully train complex CNNs. To tackle the above challenges, in this paper, we propose a boundary-weighted domain adaptive neural network (BOWDA-Net). To make the network more sensitive to the boundaries during segmentation, a boundary-weighted segmentation loss is proposed. Furthermore, an advanced boundary-weighted transfer leaning approach is introduced to address the problem of small medical imaging datasets. We evaluate our proposed model on three different MR prostate datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model is more sensitive to object boundaries and outperformed other state-of-the-art methods.""","""['Qikui Zhu', 'Bo Du', 'Pingkun Yan']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""IEEE Trans Med Imaging""","""['3D APA-Net: 3D Adversarial Pyramid Anisotropic Convolutional Network for Prostate Segmentation in MR Images.', 'Fast interactive medical image segmentation with weakly supervised deep learning method.', 'Evaluation of Deep Neural Networks for Semantic Segmentation of Prostate in T2W MRI.', 'VoxResNet: Deep voxelwise residual networks for brain segmentation from 3D MR images.', 'Investigation and benchmarking of U-Nets on prostate segmentation tasks.', 'An auxiliary diagnostic tool for common fundus diseases based on fundus color photography and light-weight classification models.', 'TISS-net: Brain tumor image synthesis and segmentation using cascaded dual-task networks and error-prediction consistency.', 'Deep Learning-Based Auto-Segmentation of Spinal Cord Internal Structure of Diffusion Tensor Imaging in Cervical Spondylotic Myelopathy.', 'Deep learning on lateral flow immunoassay for the analysis of detection data.', 'Dynamic Cross-Task Representation Adaptation for Clinical Targets Co-Segmentation in CT Image-Guided Post-Prostatectomy Radiotherapy.']"""

However, it is not clear whether it is necessary to perform the same TRUS-guided biopsy scheme for patients with different prostate specific antigen (PSA) or prostate specific antigen density (PSAD) levels. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the optimal core number for specific suspected prostate cancer patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS There were 398 patients who underwent 12-core biopsy scheme, who were included in this retrospective analysis. The 12-core scheme incorporated a classic sextant scheme and 4-core biopsies from the base and middle regions bilaterally. The cancer detection rates of patients with different PSA or PSAD levels between the 12-core, sextant, 4-core, and 2-core biopsy were compared. RESULTS The differences in cancer detection rates between the 12-core biopsy scheme and the sextant biopsy scheme were significant in patients with PSA <20 ng/mL or PSAD <0.3. There were no differences in the cancer detection rates between the 12-core biopsy scheme and the 4-core biopsy scheme in patients with PSA ≤50 ng/mL or PSAD ≤1.0. There were significant differences between 12-core and 2-core scheme when PSA ≤70 ng/mL or PSAD ≤1.5. CONCLUSIONS We recommend that the 12-core biopsy should be used for patients with PSA <20 ng/mL or PSAD <0.3. The biopsy scheme in patients with PSA 20-50 ng/mL or PSAD 0.3-1.0 should be considered in combination with DRE and MRI. For patients with PSA >50 ng/mL or PSAD >1.0, we recommend 6-core or 4-core biopsy by comprehensively considering multiple factors. The 2-core biopsy is recommended for patients with PSA >70 ng/mL or PSAD >1.5.""","""['Yue Chen', 'Xingkang Jiang', 'Ranlu Liu', 'Zhihong Zhang', 'Fei Luo', 'Shiyong Qi', 'Yong Xu']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Med Sci Monit""","""['The performance characteristics of prostate-specific antigen and prostate-specific antigen density in Chinese men.', 'Intermediate versus low or high prostate-specific antigen density level: comparison of cancer detection rate between 12- and 18-core prostate biopsy.', 'The use of prostate specific antigen density to improve the sensitivity of prostate specific antigen in detecting prostate carcinoma.', 'Is an initial saturation prostate biopsy scheme better than an extended scheme for detection of prostate cancer?

EPE was found in 70/630 patients, making a prevalence of 11.1%. The presence of EPE on biopsy was associated with higher Gleason scores and higher incidence of neuroendocrine differentiation (NED), intraductal carcinoma of the prostate (IDC-P), and perineural invasion (PNI). Compared with those without EPE, patients with EPE had shorter castration-resistant prostate cancer-free survival (CFS; median: 14.1 vs 17.1 months, P = 0.015) and overall survival (OS; median: 43.7 vs 68.3 months, P = 0.032). According to multivariate analysis, EPE was not an independent predictor for survival. Subgroup analyses demonstrated that patients with favorable characteristics, including negative NED or IDC-P status, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) score <2, and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) <50 ng ml-1, had worse prognoses if EPE was detected. In patients with PSA <50 ng ml-1, EPE was a negative independent predictor for OS (hazard ratio [HR]: 4.239, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.218-14.756, P = 0.023).

CSCs are responsible for tumor recurrence and metastases. In the present study, we examined whether ectopic overexpression of CD133, a key molecule maintaining the stability of CSCs in the human PC cell line, LnCaP, caused bone metastasis in a mouse model. Ectopic overexpression of CD133 was induced in LnCaP cells, and CSC-related protein expression was measured. Furthermore, a colony-forming assay was performed to compare results against the blank green fluorescent protein-expressing cells. Furthermore, epithelial to mesenchymal transition-related protein expression, cell migration and wound healing were investigated. To assess the role of CD133 in bone metastasis, CD133-overexpressing LnCaP cells were inoculated into mice via intracardiac injection, and bone metastasis was assessed via histological and immunohistochemical study. In addition, cytokine arrays were used to determine the cytokines involved in bone metastasis. Ectopic overexpression of CD133 in LnCaP cells increased CSC properties such as Oct-4 and Nanog expression and colony-forming ability. Furthermore, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) properties, including decreased E-cadherin and increased vimentin expression, wound gap distance, and cell migration increased. CD133 overexpression led to formation of bone metastatic tumors in mice, consistent with results of hematoxylin and eosin staining. In addition, an increase in expression of the macrophage-migration inhibitory factor was observed at the tumor margin in mice inoculated with CD133+ LNCaP cells. These findings suggest a regulatory role of CD133 in stem cell and EMT properties, and the sustained acquisition of osteolytic features in PC. Therefore, our results may facilitate development of a novel classification system and therapeutic strategies for bone metastasis of PC.""","""['Hong Moon Sohn', 'Bora Kim', 'Mineon Park', 'Young Jong Ko', 'Yeon Hee Moon', 'Jae Myung Sun', 'Byung-Cheol Jeong', 'Young Wook Kim', 'Wonbong Lim']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Oncol Lett""","""['Prostate Cancer Stem Cells: The Role of CD133.', 'Effect of HDAC9 inhibition on epithelial-mesenchymal transition in CD133+ prostate cancer cell lines.', 'Regulation of Osteosclerosis by Inoculated Cd133+ PC3 Cells in Bone-marrow Microenvironmental Niches.', 'Effect of CD133 overexpression on the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in oral cancer cell lines.', 'Cellular Plasticity in Prostate Cancer Bone Metastasis.', 'Animal models of cancer metastasis to the bone.', 'Prostate Cancer Stem Cells: The Role of CD133.', 'TA-MSCs, TA-MSCs-EVs, MIF: their crosstalk in immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment.', 'PROL1 is essential for xenograft tumor development in mice injected with the human prostate cancer cell-line, LNCaP, and modulates cell migration and invasion.', 'Repurposing antidepressant sertraline as a pharmacological drug to target prostate cancer stem cells: dual activation of apoptosis and autophagy signaling by deregulating redox balance.']"""

Recently, ultrasound has been proposed to obtain real-time volumetric images of abdominal organ motion. One approach to realize flexible probe placement throughout the treatment fraction is based on a robotic arm holding the ultrasound probe. However, the probe and the robot holding it may obstruct some of the beams with a potentially adverse effect on the plan quality. This can be mitigated by using a kinematically redundant robot, which allows maintaining a steady pose of the ultrasound probe while moving its elbow in order to minimize beam blocking. Ultimately, the motion of both the beam source carrying and the ultrasound probe holding robot contributes to the overall treatment time, i.e. beam delivery and robot motion. We propose an approach to optimize the motion and coordination of both robots based on a generalized traveling salesman problem. Furthermore, we study an application of the model to a prostate treatment scenario. Because the underlying optimization problem is hard, we compare results from a state-of-the-art heuristic solver and an approximation scheme with low computational effort. Our results show that integration of the robot holding the ultrasound probe is feasible with acceptable overhead in overall treatment time. For clinically realistic velocities of the robots, the overhead is less than 4% which is a small cost for the added benefit of continuous, volumetric, and non-ionizing tracking of organ motion over periodic x-ray-based tracking.""","""['Matthias Schlüter', 'Christoph Fürweger', 'Alexander Schlaefer']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Phys Med Biol""","""['Robotic ultrasound-guided SBRT of the prostate: feasibility with respect to plan quality.', 'Analysis and optimization of the robot setup for robotic-ultrasound-guided radiation therapy.', 'Impact of robotic ultrasound image guidance on plan quality in SBRT of the prostate.', 'AAPM and GEC-ESTRO guidelines for image-guided robotic brachytherapy: report of Task Group 192.', 'Comparison of image-guided radiotherapy technologies for prostate cancer.']"""

We aimed to investigate the predictive value of arginine and its metabolites for diagnosing prostate cancer in patients with PSA 4-10 ng/ml and evaluate their usefulness as prognostic tumor markers.  Methods:   Seventy-eight patients with a mean age of 64.50 ± 5.49 years were included in our prospective observational study between November 2016 and March 2017. They were divided into two equal groups according to the pathologic results of prostate biopsy (benign vs. malignant). Plasma arginine and ornithine levels were analyzed before biopsy by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. ELISA was used for analyzing urinary diacetylspermine.  Results:   In PSA-adjusted analysis, the malignant group had lower plasma arginine levels (p = 0.021) and arginine to ornithine ratio (AOR) (p = 0.010), but higher plasma ornithine levels (p = 0.012) and urinary diacetylspermine levels (p < 0.001) as compared with the benign group. While arginine (r = - 0.628, p < 0.001) and AOR (r = - 0.714, p < 0.001) were negatively correlated with D'Amico clinical classification (p < 0.001), ornithine (r = 0.659, p < 0.001) and diacetylspermine (r = 0.710, p < 0.001) were found to be positively correlated (p < 0.001).

Our aim was to explore the distributive impact of productivity cost methodological variation, describing the consequences for different groups.  Methods:   527 prostate cancer survivors (2-5 years post-diagnosis) completed questions on work patterns since diagnosis. Productivity loss, categorised into temporary/permanent absenteeism, reduced hours and presenteeism, were costed in €2012. Valuation approaches included the human capital approach (HCA) and the friction cost approach (FCA), with wage multipliers (WM) applied in additional analyses. Both national and self-reported wages were used. Costs were compared across socio-demographic and economic characteristics using non-parametric tests.  Results:   The estimated base case (HCA, using national wages) total productivity cost was €44,201 per prostate cancer survivor. Permanent absenteeism accounted for the largest cost (€18,537), followed by reduced work hours (€11,130), presenteeism (€8148) and temporary absenteeism (€6386). Alternative valuation estimates ranged from - 90% (FCAnational wage: €4625) to + 82% (HCAWMself-reported wage: €80,485) compared to the base case and were consistently higher for self-reported wages compared to national wages. Statistically significant differences in productivity cost were found across four of the six survivor socio-demographic and economic characteristics by valuation approach, despite no significant difference in their physical unit equivalents.  Conclusions:   Our results indicate that the distributional impact of productivity costs varies by socio-economic and demographic characteristics.

Aberrations can be identified following molecular analysis of metastatic tissue. Bone metastases, commonly present in mCRPC, hinder precision medicine due to a high proportion of biopsies with insufficient tumor cells for next-generation DNA sequencing. We aimed to investigate the feasibility of incorporating advanced target planning and needle guidance in bone biopsies and whether this procedure increases biopsy tumor yield and success rate of molecular analysis as compared to the current standards, utilizing only CT guidance.  Materials and methods:   In a pilot study, ten mCRPC patients received 68Ga-prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA)-PET/CT and diffusion-weighted MRI as biopsy planning images. These datasets were fused for targeting metastatic lesions with high tumor densities. Biopsies were performed under cone-beam CT (CBCT) guidance. Feasibility of target planning and needle guidance was assessed, and success of molecular analysis and tumor yield were reported.  Results:   Fusion target planning and CBCT needle guidance were feasible. Nine out of ten biopsies contained prostate cancer cells, with a median of 39% and 40% tumor cells by two different sequencing techniques. Molecular analysis was successful in eight of ten patients (80%). This exceeds previous reports on CT-guided biopsies that ranged from 33 to 44%. In two patients, important druggable aberrations were found.  Discussion:   A biopsy procedure using advanced target planning and needle guidance is feasible and can increase the success rate of molecular analysis in bone metastases, thereby having the potential of improving treatment outcome for patients with mCRPC.

Methods:   In this cohort study, endpoints included overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), distant progression-free survival (DFS) and local control of treated metastases (LC). The binary classification tree approach with recursive partitioning analysis (RPA) was applied to stratify the patients into risk groups based on OS, PFS and DPFS; for each endpoint, disease-free interval (DFI) was calculated. We included patients with synchronous or metachronous metastases from prostate adenocarcinoma treated with SBRT.  Results:   119 Metastases were treated with SBRT in 92 patients. Median follow-up was 22.2 months. Rates of OS at 1 and 3 years were 96.9% and 88.0%, while DPFS was 51.9% and 20.9%. Recursive partitioning analysis identified three prognostic classes for OS: Class 1: castration-sensitive patients (3 years OS 95%); Class 2: castration-resistant patients with low-intermediate risk NCCN disease (3 years OS 88.8%); Class 3: castration-resistant patients with high-risk NCCN disease (3 years OS 76.9%). Regarding DPFS, RPA divided patients into two classes, according to a cutoff value of DFI of 34 months (3 years PFS of 28.7% vs 5.8%).

No randomised trials help define how to monitor patients or when to initiate treatment with curative intent.  Methods and analysis:   A randomised, multicentre, intervention trial designed to evaluate the safety of an MRI-based active surveillance protocol, with standardised triggers for repeated biopsies and radical treatment. The aim is to reduce overtreatment of prostate cancer. 2000 men will be randomly allocated to either surveillance according to current practice or to standardised triggers at centres in Sweden, Norway, Finland and the UK. Men diagnosed in the past 12 months with prostate cancer, ≤T2a, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) <15 ng/mL, PSA density ≤0.2 ng/mL/cc, any International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) grade 1 are eligible. Men with ISUP grade 2 in <30% of cores on systematic biopsy and <10 mm cancer in one core on systematic or targeted biopsy are also eligible. Men diagnosed on systematic biopsy should have an MRI and targeted biopsies against Prostate Imaging and Reporting Data System V.2 3-5 lesions before inclusion. Identical follow-up in the two study arms: biannual PSA testing, yearly clinical examination and MRI every second year. In the experimental arm, standardised triggers based on MRI and PSA density elicit repeated biopsies. MRI and histopathological progression trigger radical treatment. Primary outcome measure is progression-free survival. Secondary outcome measures are cumulative incidence of metastatic disease, treatments with curative intent, pT3-4 at radical prostatectomy, switch to watchful waiting, prostate cancer mortality and quality of life. Inclusion started in October 2016 and in October 2018; 275 patients have been enrolled.  Ethics and dissemination:   Ethical approval was obtained in each participating country.

Zinc finger and BTB domain containing transcriptional repressors, such as ZBTB7A and ZBTB16, have been recently identified as tumor suppressors that play important roles in preventing prostate cancer progression. In this study, we used combined ChIP-seq and RNA-seq analyses of prostate cancer cells to identify direct ZBTB7A-repressed genes, which are enriched for transcriptional targets of E2F, and identified that the androgen receptor (AR) played a critical role in the transcriptional suppression of these E2F targets. AR recruitment of the retinoblastoma protein (Rb) was required to strengthen the E2F-Rb transcriptional repression complex. In addition, ZBTB7A was rapidly recruited to the E2F-Rb binding sites by AR and negatively regulated the transcriptional activity of E2F1 on DNA replication genes. Finally, ZBTB7A suppressed the growth of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) in vitro and in vivo, and overexpression of ZBTB7A acted in synergy with high-dose testosterone treatment to effectively prevent the recurrence of CRPC. Overall, this study provides novel molecular insights of the role of ZBTB7A in CRPC cells and demonstrates globally its critical role in mediating the transcriptional repression activity of AR. SIGNIFICANCE: ZBTB7A is recruited to the E2F-Rb binding sites by AR and negatively regulates the transcriptional activity of E2F1 on DNA replication genes.""","""['Dong Han#', 'Sujun Chen#', 'Wanting Han#', 'Shuai Gao', 'Jude N Owiredu', 'Muqing Li', 'Steven P Balk', 'Housheng Hansen He', 'Changmeng Cai']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Cancer Res""","""['Androgen Receptor Tumor Suppressor Function Is Mediated by Recruitment of Retinoblastoma Protein.', 'Proto-oncogene activity of melanoma antigen-A11 (MAGE-A11) regulates retinoblastoma-related p107 and E2F1 proteins.', 'Elevated E2F1 inhibits transcription of the androgen receptor in metastatic hormone-resistant prostate cancer.', 'The transcriptional programme of the androgen receptor (AR) in prostate cancer.', 'Rb/E2F: a two-edged sword in the melanocytic system.', 'ZBTB7A as a novel vulnerability in neuroendocrine prostate cancer.', 'ZBTB7A suppresses glioblastoma tumorigenesis through the transcriptional repression of EPB41L5.', 'Androgen deprivation restores ARHGEF2 to promote neuroendocrine differentiation of prostate cancer.', 'ZBTB7A, a miR-144-3p targeted gene, accelerates bladder cancer progression via downregulating HIC1 expression.', 'Exploiting the tumor-suppressive activity of the androgen receptor by CDK4/6 inhibition in castration-resistant prostate cancer.']"""

Materials and methods:   Data from 609 I-125 patients treated with PIPB were retrospectively reviewed. The presence of IC was determined by reviewing postimplant CT images. Doses delivered were determined using the Monte Carlo (model-based) calculations and the TG43 approach. Biochemical relapses at 7 and 10 years were determined according to Phoenix definition. Long-term biochemical relapse-free survival (bRFS) was determined using Kaplan-Meier estimates with log rank test. Cox proportional hazard models were used for analysis of predictor factors of biochemical recurrence.  Results:   IC were observed for 11.1% of patients. Clinical stage, PSA, Gleason score, D'Amico risk group, and ADT use were comparable between IC and no IC groups. The 7- and 10-year bRFS for the entire cohort were 94.1% and 90.6%, respectively. The bRFS at 7 years was 90.5% (with IC) vs. 94.5% (without IC) (p = 0.198); the corresponding values at 10 years were 78.8% vs. 91.8% (p = 0.046). On Cox model, only prostatic calcifications were a significant risk factor for biochemical relapse (HR: 2.30, IC 95%: 1.05-5.00, p = 0.037; and HR: 3.94; IC 95%: 1.00-15.38; p = 0.049 for univariate and multivariate analysis, respectively).  Conclusion:   The presence of IC in patients treated with PIPB decreases V100 and D90 for postimplant Monte Carlo dosimetry (compared with TG43); correspondingly, IC are associated with a lower 10-y bRFS.

Objective:   This randomised trial aimed to evaluate whether six courses of docetaxel improved biochemical disease-free survival (BDFS) after radical radiotherapy (RT) for intermediate- or high-risk PCa patients.  Design, setting, and participants:   A total of 376 patients were randomised in this multinational phase III study, and received either six cycles of adjuvant docetaxel 75 mg/m2 every 3 wk without continuous prednisone (arm A, n = 188) or surveillance (arm B, n = 188) after RT (NTC006653848). Neoadjuvant/adjuvant ADT was mandatory for all the patients. The primary endpoint was rising prostate-specific antigen (PSA) ≥2 ng/ml above the nadir PSA value. Intermediate- or high-risk PCa was defined as T2 with a Gleason score (GS) of 4 + 3, PSA > 10; T2, GS 8-10, ≤ 70 ng/ml; or any T3. The patients were followed for 5 yr by assessing PSA levels every 3 mo for 2 yr and every 6 mo thereafter.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   The study power was 89% to detect a difference in BDFS between groups, and the sample size calculation accounted for the T2/T3 distribution, where a 12%/15% difference in BDFS was assumed for the T2/T3 patients.  Results and limitations:   All six cycles were completed in 147 (78%) of the patients in arm A. The median age was 67 yr in both treatment groups, 75% had T3 disease, and 47% had GS 8-10. The median follow-up was 59 mo (range 1-111 mo). The primary endpoint was observed for 58 patients in arm A (docetaxel) and for 57 patients in arm B (surveillance). The Kaplan-Meier analysis showed no difference in the BDFS curves (p = 0.6) between the treatment groups. The 5-yr estimated biochemical progression rates were 31% for arm A and 28% for arm B. Febrile neutropenia occurred in 16% of the docetaxel patients. No deaths were related to the docetaxel treatment. There were 43 deaths during the trial, including 20 in arm A and 23 in arm B, of which nine and seven, respectively, were due to PCa. The hazard ratio from Cox multivariate analysis for PSA progression of arm A (docetaxel) versus arm B (surveillance) was 1.14 (95% confidence interval 0.79-1.64, p = 0.5).  Conclusions:   Adjuvant docetaxel without prednisone did not improve BDFS after radical RT with ADT for intermediate- or high-risk PCa.

Evidence is scarce on the risks of specific cardiovascular diseases in survivors of a wide range of cancers to inform prevention and management. In this study, we used large-scale electronic health records data from multiple linked UK databases to address these evidence gaps.  Methods:   For this population-based cohort study, we used linked primary care, hospital, and cancer registry data from the UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink to identify cohorts of survivors of the 20 most common cancers who were 18 years or older and alive 12 months after diagnosis and controls without history of cancer, matched for age, sex, and general practice. We compared risks for a range of cardiovascular disease outcomes using crude and adjusted Cox models. We fitted interactions to investigate effect modification, and flexible parametric survival models to estimate absolute excess risks over time.  Findings:   Between Jan 1, 1990, and Dec 31, 2015, 126 120 individuals with a diagnosis of a cancer of interest still being followed up at least 1 year later were identified and matched to 630 144 controls. After exclusions, 108 215 cancer survivors and 523 541 controls were included in the main analyses. Venous thromboembolism risk was elevated in survivors of 18 of 20 site-specific cancers compared with that of controls; adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) ranged from 1·72 (95% CI 1·57-1·89) in patients after prostate cancer to 9·72 (5·50-17·18) after pancreatic cancer. HRs decreased over time, but remained elevated more than 5 years after diagnosis. We observed increased risks of heart failure or cardiomyopathy in patients after ten of 20 cancers, including haematological (adjusted HR 1·94, 1·66-2·25, with non-Hodgkin lymphoma; 1·77, 1·50-2·09, with leukaemia; and 3·29, 2·59-4·18, with multiple myeloma), oesophageal (1·96, 1·46-2·64), lung (1·82, 1·52-2·17) kidney (1·73, 1·38-2·17) and ovarian (1·59, 1·19-2·12). Elevated risks of arrhythmia, pericarditis, coronary artery disease, stroke, and valvular heart disease were also observed for multiple cancers, including haematological malignancies. HRs for heart failure or cardiomyopathy and venous thromboembolism were greater in patients without previous cardiovascular disease and in younger patients. However, absolute excess risks were generally greater with increasing age. Increased risks of these outcomes seemed most pronounced in patients who had received chemotherapy.  Interpretation:   Survivors of most site-specific cancers had increased medium-term to long-term risk for one or more cardiovascular diseases compared with that for the general population, with substantial variations between cancer sites.

In the metacognitive model, beliefs about cognition (metacognitions) are a key factor in the development and maintenance of anxiety and depression. The current study evaluated if metacognitions predict anxiety and/or depression symptoms and if differential or common patterns of relationships exist across cardiac and cancer patients.  Method:   A secondary data analysis with 102 cardiac patients and 105 patients with breast or prostate cancer were included. Participants were drawn from two studies, Wells et al. [1] and Cook et al. [2]. All patients reported at least mild anxiety or depression symptoms. Patients completed the Metacognitions Questionnaire 30 (MCQ-30) and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). Hierarchical linear regressions evaluated metacognitive predictors of anxiety and depression across the groups.  Results:   The results of regression analyses controlling for a range of demographics and testing for effect of illness type showed that uncontrollability and danger and positive beliefs were common and independent predictors of anxiety in both groups. There was one positive bi-variate association between metacognitive beliefs (uncontrollability and danger) and depressive symptoms.  Conclusions:   Findings support the metacognitive model, suggesting that a common set of metacognitive factors contribute to psychological distress, particularly anxiety. Uncontrollability and danger metacognitions and positive beliefs about worry appear to make independent contributions to anxiety irrespective of type of physical illness.

However, the relevance of the disease for mental health is still controversial, especially after treatment. We drew from a representative community sample to explore the link of cancer with mental health assessing different dimensions and different periods of time.  Methods:   A cohort of 14,375 men and women (35-74 years) underwent medical assessments and was queried about cancer history, previous diagnoses of mental disorders, current mental distress symptoms, and current subjective health appraisal.  Results:   1066 participants (7.4%) reported a diagnosis of cancer (survival time M = 9.79 (SD = 9.07) years). Most common were breast (24.3%), skin (20.9%), gynecological (13.8%), and prostate cancer (12.9%). Based on cut-off-scores of standardized self-report scales (PHQ-9, GAD-2), rates of depression (8.4%; 95%CI 6.90-10.30) and anxiety symptoms (7.8%; 95%CI 6.30-9.60) corresponded to those of participants without cancer. In men, cancer was related to a lifetime diagnosis of depression (OR = 2.15; 95%CI 1.25-3.64). At the time of assessment, cancer was associated with reduced subjective health in both sexes and with anxiety symptoms in men (OR = 2.43; 95%CI 1.13-4.98).  Conclusion:   Findings indicate different relations of cancer in men and in women with different operationalizations of mental health.

This generates a large number of useless biopsies, involving both risks for the patients and costs for the national healthcare systems. Consequently, efforts were recently made to discover new biomarkers useful for PCa screening, including our proposal of interpreting a multi-parametric urinary steroidal profile with multivariate statistics. This approach has been expanded to investigate new alleged biomarkers by the application of untargeted urinary metabolomics. Urine samples from 91 patients (43 affected by PCa; 48 by benign hyperplasia) were deconjugated, extracted in both basic and acidic conditions, derivatized with different reagents, and analyzed with different gas chromatographic columns. Three-dimensional data were obtained from full-scan electron impact mass spectra. The PARADISe software, coupled with NIST libraries, was employed for the computation of PARAFAC2 models, the extraction of the significative components (alleged biomarkers), and the generation of a semiquantitative dataset.

Few methods have been developed for a continuous phenotype. However, often not all the genes within a significant gene set contribute to its significance. There is no gene set reduction method developed for continuous phenotype. We developed a computationally efficient analytical tool, called linear combination test for gene set reduction (LCT-GSR) to identify core subsets of gene sets associated with a continuous phenotype. Identifying the core subset enhances our understanding of the biological mechanism and reduces costs of disease risk assessment, diagnosis and treatment.  Results:   We evaluated the performance of our analytical tool by applying it to two real microarray studies. In the first application, we analyzed pathway expression measurements in newborns' blood to discover core genes contributing to the variation in birth weight. On average, we were able to reduce the number of genes in the 33 significant gene sets of embryonic stem cell signatures by 84.3% resulting in 229 unique genes. Using immunologic signatures, on average we reduced the number of genes in the 210 significant gene sets by 89% leading to 1603 unique genes. There were 180 unique core genes overlapping across the two databases. In the second application, we analyzed pathway expression measurements in a cohort of lethal prostate cancer patients from Swedish Watchful Waiting cohort to identify main genes associated with tumor volume. On average, we were able to reduce the number of genes in the 17 gene sets by 90% resulting in 47 unique genes.  Conclusions:   We conclude that LCT-GSR is a statistically sound analytical tool that can be used to extract core genes associated with a continuous phenotype. It can be applied to a wide range of studies in which dichotomizing the continuous phenotype is neither easy nor meaningful. Reduction to the most predictive genes is crucial in advancing our understanding of issues such as disease prevention, faster and more efficient diagnosis, intervention strategies and personalized medicine.""","""['Shabnam Vatanpour', 'Saumyadipta Pyne', 'Ana Paula Leite', 'Irina Dinu']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Comput Biol Med""","""['Gene-set analysis and reduction.', 'Linear combination test for gene set analysis of a continuous phenotype.', 'Improving gene set analysis of microarray data by SAM-GS.', 'Linear combination test for hierarchical gene set analysis.', 'Translational Metabolomics of Head Injury: Exploring Dysfunctional Cerebral Metabolism with Ex Vivo NMR Spectroscopy-Based Metabolite Quantification.', 'Geostatistical Modeling and Heterogeneity Analysis of Tumor Molecular Landscape.']"""

The study cohort series included 144 consecutive patients treated by laparoscopic radical prostatectomy. The following parameters were evaluated in each case: type of radical prostatectomy (with/without lymphadenectomy), pT and pN status, histologic type of prostate carcinoma (acinar versus mixed histology), surgical margin resection status, perineural invasion, lymphovascular invasion, biochemical recurrence status, presence of tertiary Gleason 5 pattern, and grade group that was assessed both in overall prostate cancer and in index (dominant) tumor nodule. Twenty patients (13.9%) experienced postoperative biochemical recurrence at a mean follow-up time of 12.2 months. The univariate survival analysis selected type of radical prostatectomy, histological subtype, lymphovascular invasion, American Joint Committee on Cancer pT and pN classification, tertiary Gleason 5 pattern, preoperative serum prostate specific antigen level, and the grade group assessed in both the overall prostate and index tumor nodule as significant for biochemical recurrence-free survival. Type of radical prostatectomy (P = .020), histological subtype (P = .002), lymphovascular invasion (P = .023), tertiary Gleason pattern 5 (P = .016), and grade group classification in index tumor nodule (P ≤ .0001) were selected as independent predictors of biochemical recurrence-free survival. In conclusion, our results validate grade group in the index tumor nodule as an independent predictor of biochemical recurrence-free survival, thus emphasizing the value of reporting grade group in index tumor nodule.

Growing evidence has implicated microRNAs (miRNAs or miRs) in the occurrence and progression of prostate cancer. The present study was conducted with main emphasis put on the possible effect of hypoxia-induced miR-301b-3p on prostate cancer by targeting low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1B (LRP1B). Firstly, the differentially expressed genes were identified by conducting microarray-based gene expression profiling of prostate cancer. Next, the expression of miR-301b-3p in prostate cancer cells was examined in cells treated with 1% oxygen or dimethyloxalylglycine (DMOG), and the cell line with the highest miR-301b-3p expression was selected for subsequent experiments. Subsequently, the target relationship between miR-301b-3p and LRP1B was identified. The effect of miR-301b-3p and LRP1B on cell proliferation, migration and invasion as well as tumorigenicity of transfected cells was examined using the gain- and loss-of-function approaches. Hypoxia induced miR-301b-3p was highly expressed while LRP1B was poorly expressed in prostate cancer. Moreover, miR-301b-3p could down-regulate LRP1B by interacting with LRP1B, which acted to promote the proliferation, migration and invasion abilities of prostate cancer cells in addition to tumor growth in vivo. In addition, up-regulation of LRP1B can reverse the promoting effect of miR-301b-3p on the aforementioned factors. Collectively, up-regulation of miR-301b-3p induced by hypoxia could potentially accelerate proliferation, migration and invasion of prostate cancer cells via the inhibitory effect on LRP1B expression, highlighting that miR-301b-3p may be instrumental for the therapeutic targeting of prostate cancer.""","""['Haiying Zheng', 'Ligang Bai']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Exp Mol Pathol""","""['microRNA-301b-3p downregulation underlies a novel inhibitory role of long non-coding RNA MBNL1-AS1 in non-small cell lung cancer.', 'Long non-coding RNA CASC19 facilitates non-small cell lung cancer cell proliferation and metastasis by targeting the miR-301b-3p/LDLR axis.', 'MicroRNA-494-3p targets CXCR4 to suppress the proliferation, invasion, and migration of prostate cancer.', 'The role of microRNA-338-3p in cancer: growth, invasion, chemoresistance, and mediators.', 'microRNA-205 in prostate cancer: Overview to clinical translation.', 'LRP1B suppresses HCC progression through the NCSTN/PI3K/AKT signaling axis and affects doxorubicin resistance.', 'LncRNA MBNL1-AS1 Suppresses Cell Proliferation and Metastasis of Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma through Targeting Carcinogenic miR-301b-3p.', 'Preparation, characterisation, and in vitro cancer-suppression function of RNA nanoparticles carrying miR-301b-3p Inhibitor.', 'Interplay of Low-Density Lipoprotein Receptors, LRPs, and Lipoproteins in\xa0Pulmonary Hypertension.', 'CSMD1 Mutation Related to Immunity Can Be Used as a Marker to Evaluate the Clinical Therapeutic Effect and Prognosis of Patients with Esophageal Cancer.']"""

Early results from international, open-label, phase 1/2 study NCT01934790 showed that re-treatment with radium-223 was well tolerated with favorable effects on disease progression. Here we report safety and efficacy findings from 2-year follow-up of the radium-223 re-treatment study.  Methods:   Patients with CRPC and bone metastases who completed 6 initial radium-223 injections with no disease progression in bone and later progressed were eligible for radium-223 re-treatment (up to 6 additional radium-223 injections), provided that hematologic parameters were adequate and chemotherapy had not been administered after the initial course of radium-223. Concomitant cytotoxic agents were not allowed during re-treatment but were allowed at the investigator's discretion during follow-up; other concomitant agents for prostate cancer (including abiraterone acetate or enzalutamide) were allowed at investigator's discretion. The primary objective was safety. Exploratory objectives included time to radiographic bone progression, radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS), time to total alkaline phosphatase (tALP), and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) progression, overall survival (OS), time to first symptomatic skeletal event (SSE), and SSE-free survival, all calculated from re-treatment start.

Up to now, the involvement of TRPM4 in colorectal cancer (CRC) pathophysiology remains unknown. Here, we investigated tumor tissue microarrays from 379 CRC patients and analyzed TRPM4 protein expression, tumor characteristics, and clinical outcome. High TRPM4 protein expression was associated with unfavorable tumor features characteristic for epithelial-mesenchymal transition and infiltrative growth patterns, that is, a high number of tumor buds and a low percentage in tumor border configuration. Compared to CRC cells representing early cancer stages, TRPM4 protein expression was the highest in cells representing late-stage metastatic cancer. Investigation of CRC cell line HCT116 and five CRISPR/cas9 TRPM4 knockout clones demonstrated that TRPM4 exhibited large Na+ current densities (~ 60 pA/pF). In addition, CRISPR/cas9 TRPM4 knockout clones showed a tendency toward decreased migration and invasion, cell viability, and proliferation and exhibited a shift in cell cycle when compared to HCT116. Stable overexpression of TRPM4 (TRPM4 wild-type) in two CRISPR/cas9 TRPM4 knockout clones rescued the decrease in cell viability and cell cycle shift. Stable overexpression of a nonconducting, dominant-negative TRPM4 mutant (TRPM4 D894A) did not rescue the decrease in viability or cell cycle shift. Taken together, these findings pointed to TRPM4 ion channel conductivity as the underlying mechanism for decreased viability and cell cycle shift in the TRPM4 knockout clones.

Behaviour change support, including specific behaviour change techniques (BCTs), have been used to facilitate exercise in persons undergoing oncological treatment, but more detailed knowledge from an individual perspective is needed to inform clinical practice. The aims were to explore the motivational experiences of exercise combined with behaviour change support, and to describe how specific BCTs were valued among persons exercising during oncological treatment.  Methods:   A mixed-methods study was conducted using semi-structured interviews (n = 18) and a questionnaire (n = 229). Participants with breast, colorectal or prostate cancer who completed or dropped out of a six-month exercise programme during oncological treatment were included. The interviews were analysed with thematic analysis and the questionnaire with descriptive statistics (median and interquartile range).  Results:   The participants underwent a motivational process through the exercise programme. By experiencing 'Health gains and mastery', 'Learning', 'Affinity', 'Commitment', and 'Managing challenges', they found incentives that fostered feelings of autonomy, competence and relatedness, leading to an increased motivation to exercise. Social support from coaches, structuring the physical environment with scheduled sessions, self-monitoring with resistance training log, and feedback based on heart rate monitor and fitness tests were the most valued BCTs.  Conclusions:   The results indicate the importance of finding incentives and creating an environment that fosters autonomy, competence and relatedness to motivate persons to exercise during oncological treatment. Some BCTs appear particularly useful and may be used by health professionals to increase patients' motivation to exercise.""","""['Anne-Sophie Mazzoni', 'Maria Carlsson', 'Sveinung Berntsen', 'Karin Nordin', 'Ingrid Demmelmaier']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Int J Behav Med""","""['Effect of self-regulatory behaviour change techniques and predictors of physical activity maintenance in cancer survivors: a 12-month follow-up of the Phys-Can RCT.', ""'It's like a personal motivator that you carried around wi' you': utilising self-determination theory to understand men's experiences of using pedometers to increase physical activity in a weight management programme."", 'Numbers are not the whole story: a qualitative exploration of barriers and facilitators to increased physical activity in a primary care based walking intervention.', 'Effective behaviour change techniques for physical activity and healthy eating in overweight and obese adults; systematic review and meta-regression analyses.', 'Systematic review of behaviour change techniques to promote participation in physical activity among people with dementia.', ""What's inside is all that counts?

We sought to determine if dietary omega-3 fatty acids (ω-3 FAs) delay the development and progression of CRPC and inhibit tumor-associated M2-like macrophages.  Methods:   MycCap cells were grown subcutaneously in immunocompetent FVB mice. Mice were castrated when tumors reached 300 mm2. To study effects of dietary ω-3 FAs on development of CRPC, ω-3 or ω-6 diets were started 2 days after castration and mice sacrificed after early regrowth of tumors. To study ω-3 FA effects on progression of CRPC, tumors were allowed to regrow after castration before starting the diets. M2 (CD206+) macrophages were isolated from allografts to examine ω-3 FA effects on macrophage function. Omega-3 fatty acid effects on androgen-deprived RAW264.7 M2 macrophages were studied by RT-qPCR and a migration/ invasion assay.  Results:   The ω-3 diet combined with castration lead to greater MycCap tumor regression (tumor volume reduction: 182.2 ± 33.6 mm3) than the ω-6 diet (tumor volume reduction: 148.3 ± 35.2; p = 0.003) and significantly delayed the time to CRPC (p = 0.006). Likewise, the ω-3 diet significantly delayed progression of established castrate-resistant MycCaP tumors (p = 0.003). The ω-3 diet (as compared to the ω-6 diet) significantly reduced tumor-associated M2-like macrophage expression of CSF-1R in the CRPC development model, and matrix metallopeptidase-9 (MMP-9) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in the CRPC progression model. Migration of androgen-depleted RAW264.7 M2 macrophages towards MycCaP cells was reversed by addition of docosahexaenoic acid (ω-3).  Conclusions:   Dietary omega-3 FAs (as compared to omega-6 FAs) decreased the development and progression of CRPC in an immunocompetent mouse model, and had inhibitory effects on M2-like macrophage function.

We further sought to determine whether PARP inhibition could suppress NEPC, and to identify molecular determinants of this therapeutic activity.  Experimental design:   We used a novel prostate cancer patient-derived xenograft (PDX) treatment model, prostatic adenocarcinoma and NEPC cell lines, an NEPC organoid line, and NEPC xenograft models to address the mechanistic basis of ENZ-induced NED, and to analyze suppression of NED and NEPC growth by PARP inhibition.  Results:   We identified an ENZ treatment-associated glucocorticoid receptor (GR)-MYCN-CDK5-RB1-E2F1 signaling pathway that drives NED in prostatic adenocarcinoma PDX and cell line models. Mechanistically, long-term ENZ treatment transcriptionally upregulates signaling of the GR-MYCN axis, leading to CDK5R1 and CDK5R2 upregulation, Rb1 phosphorylation, and N-Myc-mediated and E2F1-mediated NED gene expression. Importantly, olaparib (OLA) or talazoparib (TALA) suppressed these activities, and the combination of OLA and dinaciclib (DINA), an inhibitor of CDK2 and CDK5, which also inhibits Rb1 phosphorylation, suppressed NED and significantly improved therapeutic efficiency in NEPC cells in vitro and in NEPC tumors in vivo.  Conclusions:   The results of our study indicate an important role of GR-MYCN-CDK5R1/2-RB1-NED signaling in ENZ-induced and PARP inhibitor-suppressed NEPC.

However, trial populations may not reflect the real-world population. We compared patient characteristics and outcomes of cabazitaxel within and outside trials (standard of care, SOC).  Patients and methods:   mCRPC patients treated with cabazitaxel directly after docetaxel therapy before 2017 were retrospectively identified and followed to 2018. Patients were grouped on the basis of treatment within a trial or SOC. Outcomes included OS and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response.  Results:   From 3616 patients in the CAPRI registry, we identified 356 patients treated with cabazitaxel, with 173 patients treated in the second line. Trial patients had favorable prognostic factors: fewer symptoms, less visceral disease, lower lactate dehydrogenase, higher hemoglobin, more docetaxel cycles, and longer treatment-free interval since docetaxel therapy. PSA response (≥ 50% decline) was 28 versus 12%, respectively (P = .209). Median OS was 13.6 versus 9.6 months for trial and SOC subgroups, respectively (hazard ratio = 0.73, P = .067). After correction for prognostic factors, there was no difference in survival (hazard ratio = 1.00, P = .999). Longer duration of androgen deprivation therapy treatment, lower lactate dehydrogenase, and lower PSA were associated with longer OS; visceral disease had a trend for shorter OS.  Conclusion:   Patients treated with cabazitaxel in trials were fitter and showed outcomes comparable to registration trials.

Conclusion:   DK model may add value in PCa detection and diagnosis, but none can differentiate low-from high-grade PCas (including GS=3+4 from GS=4+3).""","""['Kai Ding', 'Yong Yao', 'Yun Gao', 'Xudong Lu', 'Hongwei Chen', 'Qunfeng Tang', 'Chenchen Hua', 'Ming Zhou', 'Xinnong Zou', 'Qihua Yin']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Eur J Radiol""","""['Prostate cancer: feasibility and preliminary experience of a diffusional kurtosis model for detection and assessment of aggressiveness of peripheral zone cancer.', 'Non-Gaussian water diffusion kurtosis imaging of prostate cancer.', 'Diagnostic evaluation of magnetization transfer and diffusion kurtosis imaging for prostate cancer detection in a re-biopsy population.', 'Multiparametric MRI in detection and staging of prostate cancer.', 'Correlation between ADC values and Gleason score in evaluation of prostate cancer: multicentre experience and review of the literature.', 'Sub-differentiation of PI-RADS 3 lesions in TZ by advanced diffusion-weighted imaging to aid the biopsy decision process.']"""

Exposure of these tissues to high doses of radiation leads to damage to villous, inflammation, pain, ulcer and bleeding, which may cause malabsorption and gastrointestinal disorders. To date, several procedures such as pharmaceutical treatment have been proposed for protection and mitigation of gastrointestinal toxicity following radiotherapy.  Aims:   In the current study, we aimed to investigate the possible radioprotection of ileum and colon in rats using a combination of melatonin and metformin.  Methods:   In this experimental study, 30 male Wistar rats were randomly assigned to six groups: control, melatonin (100 mg/kg) treatment, melatonin (100 mg/kg) plus metformin (100 mg/kg) treatment, radiation (10 Gy to whole body) group, radiation + melatonin (100 mg/kg) treatment, and radiation + melatonin (100 mg/kg) plus metformin (100 mg/kg) treatment. After 3.5 days, rats were sacrificed and their ileum and colon tissues carefully removed. Histopathological evaluations were conducted on these tissue samples.  Results:   Histological evaluations reported moderate to severe damages to ileum and colon following whole body irradiation. Melatonin administration was able to protect the ileum remarkably, while the combination of melatonin and metformin was less effective. Interestingly, for the colon, melatonin was less effective while its combination with metformin was able to protect against radiation toxicity completely.  Conclusion:   For the ileum, melatonin was a more effective radioprotector compared to its combination with metformin. However, the combination of melatonin and metformin can be proposed as an ideal radioprotector for the colon.""","""['Masoud Najafi', 'Mohsen Cheki', 'Gholamreza Hassanzadeh', 'Peyman Amini', 'Dheyauldeen Shabeeb', 'Ahmed E Musa']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Antiinflamm Antiallergy Agents Med Chem""","""['The Radioprotective Effect of Combination of Melatonin and Metformin on Rat Duodenum Damage Induced by Ionizing Radiation: A Histological Study.', 'Mitigation of Radiation-Induced Gastrointestinal System Injury by Melatonin: A Histopathological Study.', 'Mitigation of Radiation-induced Gastrointestinal System Injury using Resveratrol or Alpha-lipoic Acid: A Pilot Histopathological Study.', 'Metformin as a Radiation Modifier; Implications to Normal Tissue Protection and Tumor Sensitization.', 'Melatonin as an adjuvant in radiotherapy for radioprotection and radiosensitization.', 'Radioprotective potential of probiotics against gastrointestinal and neuronal toxicity: a preclinical study.', 'Combined Administration of Pravastatin and Metformin Attenuates Acute Radiation-Induced Intestinal Injury in Mouse and Minipig Models.', 'Nuclear and Radiological Emergencies: Biological Effects, Countermeasures and Biodosimetry.', 'Protective Effects of Melatonin and Misoprostol against Experimentally Induced Increases in Intestinal Permeability in Rats.', 'Protective rules of natural antioxidants against gamma-induced damage-A review.']"""

The CDKN2B-AS1 gene overlaps a critical region of 125 kb covering the CDKN2B gene. The CDKN2A/B locus encompasses three major tumor suppressors juxtaposed and joined into a p16-CDKN2A/p15-CDKN2B/p14-ARF gene cluster. CDKN2A encodes splice variants p16-CDKN2A and p14-ARF, and CDKN2B encodes p15-CDKN2B. ANRIL shares a bidirectional promoter with the p14-ARF gene and is transcribed from the opposite strand to the cluster. We performed an analysis of the expression level of ANRIL and tumor suppressor p16-CDKN2A, p15-CDKN2B, and p14-ARF genes using quantitative RT-PCR in a multitumor panel. We observed the overexpression of the four genes ANRIL, p16-CDKN2A, p15-CDKN2B, and p14-ARF in the great majority of the 17 different cancer types. ANRIL was upregulated in 13/17 tumors compared to normal tissues, ranging from 5% (prostate cancer) to 91% (cervix cancer), with variable expression of p16-CDKN2A, p15-CDKN2B, and p14-ARF genes. A high positive correlation was identified between levels of expression of ANRIL and the three tumor suppressors. The strongest positive association was observed with p14-ARF (p < 0.001) in all but one (lung squamous cell carcinoma) of the examined tumor types. This correlation suggests coordinated deregulated mechanisms in all cancer types through aberrant activation of a bidirectional p14-ARF/ANRIL promoter.

While prostate cancer carries the potential to metastasize to the breast, the synchronous or metachronous co-occurrence of primary breast and primary prostate cancers is quite unusual. Prostate cancer in men of African descent may have its own behaviour with regards to its relationship with male breast cancer. Case presentation: Case 1: A 64 year old male presented to Chris Hani Baragwanath Hospital (CHBAH) with a 2 years history of a painless left breast lump. A core biopsy was done and confirmed breast carcinoma. Tamoxifen was started but, due to disease progression, he underwent left modified radical mastectomy followed by chemotherapy. Prostate biopsy was done for raised Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) and suspicious prostate on digital rectal examination. A prostatic adenocarcinoma was subsequently diagnosed with bone metastases on bone scan. He was started on Androgen deprivation therapy and followed up every 3 months. Case 2: A 68 year old male presented to CHBAH with a 1 year history of a painless right breast lump. A core biopsy confirmed breast cancer. Tamoxifen was started, followed by right modified radical mastectomy and chemotherapy for disease progression. A raised PSA and suspicious prostate on digital rectal examination prompted a prostate biopsy revealing a prostatic adenocarcinoma. Bone scan was negative for metastasis. He is currently on 3 monthly Androgen deprivation therapy and awaiting radiation. Conclusion: This clinical practice article not only presents this exceptionally rare duality but highlights that both cancers can coexist either as sporadic conditions, or as a result of genetic mutations. Thus, we suggest that men with prostate cancer be screened clinically, biochemically and genetically for breast cancer and vice versa.""","""['Alain Mwamba Mukendi', 'Eunice Van Den Berg', 'Sugeshnee Pather', 'Rushen Siva Padayachee']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""F1000Res""","""['A male patient with metachronous triple cancers of small cell lung, prostate and breast.', 'Synchronous bilateral breast cancer in a male patient following hormone therapy for prostate cancer.', 'Comparison of Digital Rectal Examination and Serum Prostate Specific Antigen in the Early Detection of Prostate Cancer: Results of a Multicenter Clinical Trial of 6,630 Men.', 'Adenoid cystic carcinoma of the prostate: case report on a rare entity and review of the literature.', 'Value of determining prostate-specific antigen for early detection or prostatic carcinoma.']"""

In this study, we revisited the idea of coupling the stoichiometric calibration method with virtual monoenergetic CT datasets (MonoCT) generated by modern DECT scanners, because of its readiness for implementation with the existing TPS. Our objective was to determine the optimal energy of the MonoCT dataset for stoichiometric calibration and estimate the overall uncertainty in SPR estimation at the optimal energy. We performed stoichiometric calibration for MonoCT datasets across the energy range available on a Siemens Force DECT scanner and a Philips IQon DECT scanner in a 10 keV step. We estimated the uncertainties of different sources (imaging, modeling, and inherent uncertainties) for different tissue types (lung, soft, and bone tissues) associated with each energy; these were then combined into a single composite uncertainty for three tumor sites (head-and-neck (HN), lung, and prostate). The optimal energy was eventually selected based on the composite range uncertainty, which turned out to be 160 keV for both DECT scanners. At 160 keV, the total uncertainties (2σ) in SPR estimation were determined to be 3.2%-4.5%, 0.9%, and 1.4%-1.6% for lung, soft, and bony tissues, respectively. These results were comparable to the corresponding values estimated for the DECT approach evaluated in our previous study: 3.8%, 1.2% and 2.0%, for lung, soft, and bony tissues, respectively. The composite range uncertainties (2σ) were estimated as 1.5%, 1.7%, and 1.5% for prostate, lung, and HN, respectively. Our results demonstrated the potential of MonoCT images for reducing proton SPR uncertainty.

Here, the structural modification of darolutamide resulted in the discovery of dual-action AR inhibitors and down-regulators. Unlike other traditional AR antagonists targeting the AR-LBD, compounds 4k and 4b not only inhibit the activities of wt-AR and AR-F876L mutant but also downregulate the protein expression of full-length (AR-full) and AR variant 7 (AR-V7) at mRNA level. In cell proliferation assays, compounds 4k and 4b exhibited better antiproliferative activities than darolutamide and enzalutamide against AR-V7-positive 22Rv1 cells and VCaP cells. In addition, 4k demonstrated better antitumor activity than clinically used enzalutamide in castration-resistant VCaP xenograft model.

Focal therapy was offered for low or intermediate risk disease (prostate specific antigen less than 20 ng/ml, Gleason score 7 or less and clinical stage T2b or less). Patients with previous prostate cancer treatment or less than 6 months of followup were excluded from study. Failure was defined as local or systemic salvage treatment, a positive biopsy Gleason score of 7 or greater in-field or out-of-field in nontreated patients, prostate cancer metastasis or prostate cancer specific death.

We sought to assess the effect of extended pelvic lymph node dissection on oncologic outcomes in patients with characteristics of D'Amico intermediate or high risk prostate cancer treated with radical prostatectomy.  Materials and methods:   In a multi-institutional database of 4 centers we identified 9,742 patients who underwent radical prostatectomy from 2000 to 2017 with or without pelvic lymph node dissection. Only patients with a greater than 5% probability of lymph node invasion according to the Briganti nomogram were included in study. We performed 2:1 propensity score matching to account for potential differences between the 2 cohorts. Cox regression models were used to test the effect of pelvic lymph node dissection on biochemical recurrence, metastasis and cancer specific mortality.  Results:   Overall 707 patients (7.3%) did not undergo pelvic lymph node dissection, of whom 520 and 187 harbored D'Amico intermediate and high risk characteristics, respectively. A median of 14 lymph nodes (IQR 8-21) were removed in the pelvic lymph node dissection cohort and 1,714 of these cases (19.0%) harbored lymph node metastasis. After propensity score matching the biochemical recurrence-free, metastasis-free and cancer specific mortality-free survival rates were 60.4% vs 65.6% (p=0.07), 87.0% vs 90.0% (p=0.06) and 95.2% vs 96.4% (p=0.2) for pelvic lymph node dissection vs no pelvic lymph node dissection 120 months after radical prostatectomy.

Methods:   patient-reported outcomes were evaluated using Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite scores at baseline and 1, 3, 6, 12 and 36 months after treatment, respectively, using differences from baseline scores.  Results:   Urinary function was the same in the three groups at baseline, but worse after surgery than after permanent prostate brachytherapy until 12 months, and similar after open radical prostatectomy and permanent prostate brachytherapy and better than after laparoscopic radical prostatectomy at 36 months. Urinary bother was significantly worse at 1 month after surgery, but better after open radical prostatectomy than after permanent prostate brachytherapy and laparoscopic radical prostatectomy at 3 months, after which symptoms improved gradually in all groups. Obstructive/irritative symptoms were worse after permanent prostate brachytherapy than after open radical prostatectomy at 36 months, and worse after laparoscopic radical prostatectomy until 6 months. Urinary incontinence was worse after surgery, particularly after 1 month. This symptom returned to the baseline level at 12 months after open radical prostatectomy, but recovery after laparoscopic radical prostatectomy was slower. Bowel function after permanent prostate brachytherapy was significantly worse than after surgery at 1 month and this continued until 6 months. Bowel bother was slightly worse at 3 and 6 months after permanent prostate brachytherapy compared to these time points after surgery.  Conclusion:   Urinary function and bother were worst after laparoscopic radical prostatectomy, especially in the early postoperative phase, whereas urinary obstructive/irritative symptom, bowel function and bother were worse after permanent prostate brachytherapy.

The purpose of this study was to apply a novel method to report resistance training dose, adherence, and tolerance in patients with cancer.  Methods:   A total of 47 prostate cancer patients (70.1 ± 8.9 yr, body mass index, 28.6 ± 4.0) with bone metastatic disease completed an exercise program for 12 wk. We assessed traditional metrics of adherence (attendance and loss to follow-up), in addition to novel proposed metrics (exercise-relative dose intensity, dose modification, and exercise interruption). Total training volume in kilograms (repetitions × sets × training load (weight)) was calculated for each patient.  Results:   Attendance assessed from traditional metrics was 79.5% ± 17.0% and four patients (9%) were lost to follow-up. The prescribed and actual cumulative total dose of resistance training was 139,886 ± 69,150 kg and 112,835 ± 83,499 kg, respectively, with a mean exercise-relative dose intensity of 77.4% ± 16.6% (range: 19.4% -99.4%). Resistance training was missed (1-2 consecutive sessions) or interrupted (missed ≥3 consecutive sessions) in 41 (87%) and 24 (51%) participants, respectively. Training dose was modified (reduction in sets, repetitions, or weight) in 40 (85%) of patients. Importantly, using attendance as a traditional metric of adherence, these sessions would have all counted as adherence to the protocol.  Conclusions:   Traditional reporting metrics of resistance training in exercise oncology may overestimate exercise adherence. Our proposed metrics to capture resistance training dose, adherence, and tolerance may have important applications for future studies and clinical practice.""","""['Ciaran M Fairman', 'Tormod S Nilsen', 'Robert U Newton', 'Dennis R Taaffe', 'Nigel Spry', 'David Joseph', 'Suzanne K Chambers', 'Zac P Robinson', 'Nicolas H Hart', 'Michael C Zourdos', 'Brian C Focht', 'Carolyn J Peddle-McIntyre', 'Daniel A Galvão']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Med Sci Sports Exerc""","""['Novel Methods for Reporting of Exercise Dose and Adherence: An Exploratory Analysis.', 'Reporting Attendance and Resistance Exercise Compliance in Men with Localized Prostate Cancer.', 'Exercise Adherence and Effect of Self-Regulatory Behavior Change Techniques in Patients Undergoing Curative Cancer Treatment: Secondary Analysis from the Phys-Can Randomized Controlled Trial.', 'Considerations of the Principles of Resistance Training in Exercise Studies for the Management of Knee Osteoarthritis: A Systematic Review.', 'Dose-Response Relationships of Resistance Training in Healthy Old Adults: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.', 'Feasibility of home-based exercise training during adjuvant treatment for metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer patients treated with an androgen receptor pathway inhibitor (EXACT).', 'Evaluating individual level change in physical function response following an exercise program for cancer survivors.', 'A feasibility, safety, and efficacy evaluation of supervised aerobic and resistance exercise for patients with glioblastoma undertaking adjuvant chemoradiotherapy.', 'Therapeutic validity and effectiveness of exercise interventions after lower limb-salvage surgery for sarcoma: a systematic review.', ""Exercise counselling and referral in cancer care: an international scoping survey of health care practitioners' knowledge, practices, barriers, and facilitators.""]"""

In this study, we examined this proposed use of a limited percent Gleason pattern 4 (%GP4) to identify candidates of active surveillance among 315 patients who underwent radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer with a GS of 6 or 3+4=7 via needle biopsy. The latter cases were divided into 4 groups using highest or overall %GP4 cut-off values of 5% and 10% as determined from prostate needle biopsies. The frequency of adverse pathology and risk of biochemical recurrence were compared between the GS 6 and both GS 3+4=7 groups. Adverse pathology was defined as a GS 4+3=7 or higher, pT3b staging or positive lymph node metastasis. Notably, the Gleason pattern 4 <5% and GS 6 groups did not differ significantly in terms of the frequency of adverse pathology and risk of biochemical recurrence by the highest method. However, other highest Gleason pattern 4 categories had significantly higher frequencies and risks. Using the overall method, even the Gleason pattern 4 <5% group had a significantly higher frequency of adverse pathology and risk of biochemical recurrence relative to the GS 6 group.

Growing evidence shows prostate androgen-regulated transcript 1 (PART1) is considered as effective markers for prostate cancer, and has been shown to be associated with poor prognosis of NSCLC. However, the tumorigenic mechanism of PART1 in NSCLC remains to be investigated. In this study, we found that the expression of PART1 was robustly induced in NSCLC tissues and cell lines. Functional studies established that overexpression of PART1 could promote NSCLC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, while interference of PART1 inhibited NSCLC progression. Our results also identified miR-635 as a novel target of PART1, whose expression was inhibited by PART1 in NSCLC cell lines. Moreover, gain- and loss-of-function studies revealed that PART1 could sponge miR-635 and increase the expression of Janus kinase (JAK) and signal transducer and activator of transcription proteins (STATs). Finally, we deciphered the molecular mechanism by which PART1 contributed to promotion of NSCLC cell progression via phosphorylation and activation of JAK-STAT signaling pathway. The animal experiment further confirmed that interference of NSCLC could suppress in vivo tumorigenic ability of NSCLC with favorable pharmacological activity via inactivation of JAK-STAT signaling pathway. In conclusion, our findings clarified the biologic significance of PART1/miR-635/JAK-STAT axis in NSCLC progression and provided novel evidence that PART1 may be a new potential therapeutic target for the treatment of NSCLC.""","""['Dengyan Zhu', 'Yang Yu', 'Wei Wang', 'Kai Wu', 'Donglei Liu', 'Yang Yang', 'Chunyang Zhang', 'Yu Qi', 'Song Zhao']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Cancer Med""","""['DYNC1H1 regulates NSCLC cell growth and metastasis by IFN-γ-JAK-STAT signaling and is associated with an aberrant immune response.', 'lncRNA HNF1A-AS1 modulates non-small cell lung cancer progression by targeting miR-149-5p/Cdk6.', 'LncRNA PART1 facilitates the malignant progression of colorectal cancer via miR-150-5p/LRG1 axis.', 'JAK-STAT signaling in cancer: From cytokines to non-coding genome.', 'Therapeutic Potential of Janus Kinase Inhibitors for the Management of Interstitial Lung Disease.', 'A review on the role of long non-coding RNA prostate androgen-regulated transcript 1 (PART1) in the etiology of different disorders.', 'Regulatory roles of noncoding RNAs in intervertebral disc degeneration as potential therapeutic targets (Review).', 'Cigarette smoke-promoted increases in osteopontin expression attract mesenchymal stem cell recruitment and facilitate lung cancer metastasis.', 'Long Non-coding RNAs, Lnc(ing) RNA Metabolism to Cancer Biology.', 'Long non‑coding RNA PART1: dual role in cancer.']"""

Methods:   A convolutional neural network (CNN) was trained for automated measurements in 18 F-choline (FCH) PET/CT scans obtained prior to radical prostatectomy (RP) in 45 patients with newly diagnosed PCa. Automated values were obtained for prostate volume, maximal standardized uptake value (SUVmax ), mean standardized uptake value of voxels considered abnormal (SUVmean ) and volume of abnormal voxels (Volabn ). The product SUVmean × Volabn was calculated to reflect total lesion uptake (TLU). Corresponding manual measurements were performed. CNN-estimated data were compared with the weighted surgically removed tissue specimens and manually derived data and related to clinical parameters assuming that 1 g ≈ 1 ml of tissue.  Results:   The mean (range) weight of the prostate specimens was 44 g (20-109), while CNN-estimated volume was 62 ml (31-108) with a mean difference of 13·5 g or ml (95% CI: 9·78-17·32). The two measures were significantly correlated (r = 0·77, P<0·001). Mean differences (95% CI) between CNN-based and manually derived PET measures of SUVmax, SUVmean, Volabn (ml) and TLU were 0·37 (-0·01 to 0·75), -0·08 (-0·30 to 0·14), 1·40 (-2·26 to 5·06) and 9·61 (-3·95 to 23·17), respectively.

The prevalence of chronic pain among cancer survivors has not been comprehensively reported.  Methods:   This study used data from the National Health Interview Survey (2010-2017) to compare the prevalence of chronic pain between participants with a cancer diagnosis and participants without one. Adjusted odds ratios (AORs) of having chronic pain were assessed by multivariable logistic regression, which included an age (less than the median age vs greater than or equal to the median age) × cancer diagnosis (yes vs no) interaction term. Among cancer survivors, multivariable logistic regression defined the odds of feeling depressed, feeling worried/nervous/anxious, being unable to work, and needing assistance for activities of daily living (ADLs) and instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs).  Results:   Among 115,091 participants, a cancer diagnosis was associated with an increased AOR of chronic pain in comparison with the general population (30.8% vs 15.7%; AOR, 1.48; 95% confidence interval, 1.38-1.59). Older age was associated with higher odds of chronic pain (P < .001 across all increasing age categories); however, the positive association between older age and chronic pain was seen only in participants without cancer and was not seen in those with a cancer diagnosis (Page×cancer < .001). Among patients reporting a cancer diagnosis, chronic pain was associated with greater odds of feeling depressed, feeling worried/nervous/anxious, being unable to work, and needing assistance with ADLs or IADLs (P < .001 for all).  Conclusions:   Cancer survivors appear to have a high prevalence of chronic pain, which is associated with worse mental, functional, and employment outcomes.

Bicalutamide, one of the commonly used AR inhibitors in prostate cancer, in combination with AI, did not show synergistic activity in patients with estrogen receptor-positive and AI-resistant disease in this phase II, single-arm study. The clinical benefit rate and objective response rate at 6 months were 16.7% and 0%, respectively, and the study was terminated after the first stage.  Background:   Endocrine resistance is a major problem in clinical practice. Studies have shown that androgen receptor (AR) signaling activation may be one of the mechanisms, and targeting AR showed some promising results in AR-positive triple-negative breast cancer. The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy and safety of bicalutamide plus another aromatase inhibitor in patients with nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitor (AI) or steroidal AI resistance and estrogen receptor (ER)-positive and AR-positive advanced breast cancer.  Methods:   A Simon's two-stage, phase II, single-arm study was conducted. We assumed the clinical benefit rate (CBR) of 40% would be significant in clinical practice. In this case, if ≥4 patients of the 19 patients in the first stage benefited from treatment, the CBR would achieve the assumed endpoint. If fewer than four patients benefited from treatment in the first stage, the trial would be terminated. All patients received bicalutamide 50 mg per day orally plus another aromatase inhibitor. The primary outcome was CBR; secondary outcomes included objective response rate (ORR), progression-free survival (PFS), and tolerability.  Results:   A total of 19 patients enrolled in the first stage, and 18 patients met all criteria for analysis. The trial terminated according to protocol after the first stage. After a median follow-up of 14 months, the CBR at 6 months was 16.7% (3/18); no patients with partial or complete response were observed. The median PFS was 2.7 months. Bicalutamide in combination with AI was well tolerated.  Conclusion:   Bicalutamide in combination with another AI did not show synergistic activity in patients with ER-positive breast cancer and AI resistance. Results suggest that no more large-sample clinical trials should be conducted in this population for overcoming endocrine resistance.""","""['Qianyi Lu', 'Wen Xia', 'Kaping Lee', 'Jingmin Zhang', 'Huimin Yuan', 'Zhongyu Yuan', 'Yanxia Shi', 'Shusen Wang', 'Fei Xu']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Oncologist""","""['Phase II trial of bicalutamide in patients with androgen receptor-positive, estrogen receptor-negative metastatic Breast Cancer.', 'The potential clinical benefit of targeting androgen receptor (AR) in estrogen-receptor positive breast cancer cells treated with Exemestane.', 'Androgen Receptor Expression and Bicalutamide Antagonize Androgen Receptor Inhibit β-Catenin Transcription Complex in Estrogen Receptor-Negative Breast Cancer.', 'Overcoming aromatase inhibitor resistance in breast cancer: possible mechanisms and clinical applications.', 'Complete Response of Metastatic Androgen Receptor-Positive Breast Cancer to Bicalutamide: Case Report and Review of the Literature.', 'Emerging Intrinsic Therapeutic Targets for Metastatic Breast Cancer.', 'Nuclear Receptor Imaging In Vivo-Clinical and Research Advances.', 'Intrinsic Subtypes and Androgen Receptor Gene Expression in Primary Breast Cancer.

The objectives of the Novel Integration of New prostate radiation schedules with adJuvant Androgen deprivation (NINJA) clinical trial are to compare two emerging SBRT regimens for efficacy with technical substudies focussing on MRI only planning and the use of knowledge-based planning (KBP) to assess radiotherapy plan quality.  Methods and analysis:   Eligible patients must have biopsy-proven unfavourable intermediate or favourable high-risk PC, have an Eastern Collaborative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0-1 and provide written informed consent. All patients will receive 6 months in total of androgen deprivation therapy. Patients will be randomised to one of two SBRT regimens. The first will be 40 Gy in five fractions given on alternating days (SBRT monotherapy). The second will be 20 Gy in two fractions given 1 week apart followed 2 weeks later by 36 Gy in 12 fractions given five times per week (virtual high-dose rate boost (HDRB)). The primary efficacy outcome will be biochemical clinical control at 5 years. Secondary endpoints for the initial portion of NINJA look at the transition of centres towards MRI only planning and the impact of KBP on real-time (RT) plan assessment. The first 150 men will demonstrate accrual feasibility as well as addressing the KBP and MRI planning aims, prior to proceeding with total accrual to 472 patients as a phase III randomised controlled trial.  Ethics and dissemination:   NINJA is a multicentre cooperative clinical trial comparing two SBRT regimens for men with PC. It builds on promising results from several single-armed studies, and explores radiation dose escalation in the Virtual HDRB arm. The initial component includes novel technical elements, and will form an important platform set for a definitive phase III study.

We show that JAB1 amplification in human prostate cancer (PCa) correlates with reduced overall survival and disease-free progression. Immunohistochemical staining shows enhanced expression of JAB1 in the cytoplasmic compartment of PCa cells compared to the normal prostate epithelium, indicating the activity/function of JAB1 is altered in PCa. To test the function of JAB1 in PCa, we efficiently silenced JAB1 expression using four unique shRNAs in three PCa cell lines (LNCaP, C4-2, and PC-3) and an immortalized prostate epithelial cell line, RWPE-1. Our data clearly show that silencing JAB1 robustly suppresses the growth of PCa cells, but not RWPE-1 cells, suggesting that PCa cells become addicted to JAB1. To study the potential mechanism by which JAB1 controls PCa growth, we profiled gene expression changes by whole transcriptome microarray analysis of C4-2 cells silenced for JAB1 using a pool of 3 shRNAs compared to scrambled shRNA control. We identified 1268 gene changes ≥1.5 fold by silencing JAB1 in C4-2. Western blot confirmation and bioinformatics pathway analyses support that PCa cells become addicted to JAB1 through controlling the following signaling pathways: cell cycle, p53 signaling, DNA replication, TGF-β/BMP, MAPK, TNF, and steroid hormone biosynthesis. We propose that UGT2B28, UGT2B10, UGT2B11, Skp2, EZH2, MDM2, BIRC5 (Survivin), UBE2C, and Smads 1/5/8, which are all associated with the abovementioned key oncogenic pathways, may play critical roles in the putative oncogenic function of JAB1 in PCa.""","""['David Danielpour', 'Sandhya Purighalla', 'Eric Wang', 'Patrick M Zmina', 'Antara Sarkar', 'Guang Zhou']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Biochem Biophys Res Commun""","""['Jab1 Silencing Inhibits Proliferation and Sensitizes to Cisplatin in Biliary Tract Cancer.', 'COPS5 and LASP1 synergistically interact to downregulate 14-3-3σ expression and promote colorectal cancer progression via activating PI3K/AKT pathway.', 'The crucial p53-dependent oncogenic role of JAB1 in osteosarcoma in vivo.', 'Jab1/Cops5: a promising target for cancer diagnosis and therapy.', 'The pivotal oncogenic role of Jab1/CSN5 and its therapeutic implications in human cancer.', 'Pan-cancer analyses of Jab1/COPS5 reveal oncogenic role and clinical outcome in human cancer.', 'Treatment with b-AP15 to Inhibit UCHL5 and USP14 Deubiquitinating Activity and Enhance p27 and Cyclin E1 for Tumors with p53 Deficiency.', 'CUL3 and COPS5 Related to the Ubiquitin-Proteasome Pathway Are Potential Genes for Muscle Atrophy in Mice.', 'Personalized 3-Gene Panel for Prostate Cancer Target Therapy.', 'Targeting the COP9 signalosome for cancer therapy.']"""

To overcome these problems, there have been extensive studies regarding the possibility of improving treatment by employing combination therapy, and by exploring therapeutic modalities with reduced side-effects (such as photodynamic therapy (PDT)). Herein, this work has two aims: (i) to develop self-activating photosensitizers for use in light-free photodynamic therapy, which would eliminate light-related restrictions that this therapy currently possesses; (ii) to assess their co-treatment potential when combined with reference chemotherapeutic agents (Tamoxifen and Metformin). We synthesized three new photosensitizers capable of self-activation and singlet oxygen production via a chemiluminescent reaction involving only a cancer marker and without requiring a light source. Cytotoxicity assays demonstrated the cytotoxic activity of all photosensitizers for prostate and breast tumor cell lines. Analysis of co-treatment effects revealed significant improvements for breast cancer, producing better results for all combinations than just for the individual photosensitizers and even Tamoxifen. By its turn, co-treatment for prostate cancer only presented better results for one combination than for just the isolated photosensitizers and Metformin.

We validated a RM combining mpMRI and clinical parameters for the probability of harboring significant prostate cancer (sPC, Gleason Score ≥ 3+4) for biopsy-naïve men.  Material and methods:   The original RM was based on data of 670 biopsy-naïve men from Heidelberg University Hospital who underwent mpMRI with PI-RADS scoring prior to MRI/TRUS-fusion biopsy 2012-2015. Validity was tested by a consecutive cohort of biopsy-naïve men from Heidelberg (n = 160) and externally by a cohort of 133 men from University College London Hospital (UCLH). Assessment of validity was performed at fusion-biopsy by calibration plots, receiver operating characteristics curve and decision curve analyses. The RM`s performance was compared to ERSPC-RC3, ERSPC-RC3+PI-RADSv1.0 and PI-RADSv1.0 alone.  Results:   SPC was detected in 76 men (48%) at Heidelberg and 38 men (29%) at UCLH. The areas under the curve (AUC) were 0.86 for the RM in both cohorts. For ERSPC-RC3+PI-RADSv1.0 the AUC was 0.84 in Heidelberg and 0.82 at UCLH, for ERSPC-RC3 0.76 at Heidelberg and 0.77 at UCLH and for PI-RADSv1.0 0.79 in Heidelberg and 0.82 at UCLH. Calibration curves suggest that prevalence of sPC needs to be adjusted to local circumstances, as the RM overestimated the risk of harboring sPC in the UCLH cohort. After prevalence-adjustment with respect to the prevalence underlying ERSPC-RC3 to ensure a generalizable comparison, not only between the Heidelberg and die UCLH subgroup, the RM`s Net benefit was superior over the ERSPC`s and the mpMRI`s for threshold probabilities above 0.1 in both cohorts.

Thus, they are considered promising therapeutic targets and prognostic markers. It follows that their precise quantification is of utmost relevance in research and development. The simultaneous quantification of A1 and A2 proteins in the cells helps the comprehension of cancer biology mechanisms and response to drug treatments. However, the high homology at the amino-acidic level (92%) can cause antibodies cross-reaction. Moreover, the commonly employed western blotting just gives semi-quantitative data and does not allow the detection of both protein targets within the same cell. Thus, we developed an in cell western (ICW) technique to bypass the above limitations.  Methods:   Firstly, relevant antibodies cross-reaction was excluded by immunohistochemistry on normal pancreatic tissue; then eEF1A1-A2 protein levels were quantitated by ICW in prostate and colorectal cancer cell lines in 96 well plates under different conditions, which include: 1) drug treatment, 2) siRNA silencing, 3) cell seeding density.  Results:   We show that: 1) eEF1A1-A2 levels vary depending on the cell type following drug treatment, 2) ICW can accurately detect eEF1A1-A2 protein levels following siRNA silencing, 3) cell seeding density influences eEF1A1-A2 levels, depending on cell type.  Conclusions:   ICW is a valuable tool to specifically determine the intracellular level of eEF1A1-A2 proteins thus contributing to better define their role as potential therapeutic targets and prognostic markers in human tumors as well as for drug effects screening.""","""['Alessandra Bosutti', 'Odeta Kalaja', 'Fabrizio Zanconati', 'Barbara Dapas', 'Gabriele Grassi', 'Sabina Passamonti', 'Bruna Scaggiante']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""J Pharm Biomed Anal""","""['High eEF1A1 Protein Levels Mark Aggressive Prostate Cancers and the In Vitro Targeting of eEF1A1 Reveals the eEF1A1-actin Complex as a New Potential Target for Therapy.', 'On the Need to Tell Apart Fraternal Twins eEF1A1 and eEF1A2, and Their Respective Outfits.', 'Dissecting the expression of EEF1A1/2 genes in human prostate cancer cells: the potential of EEF1A2 as a hallmark for prostate transformation and progression.', 'Effects of eEF1A1 targeting by aptamer/siRNA in chronic lymphocytic leukaemia cells.', 'Ser/Thr kinases and polyamines in the regulation of non-canonical functions of elongation factor 1A.', 'High eEF1A1 Protein Levels Mark Aggressive Prostate Cancers and the In Vitro Targeting of eEF1A1 Reveals the eEF1A1-actin Complex as a New Potential Target for Therapy.', 'An Overview of siRNA Delivery Strategies for Urological Cancers.', 'On the Need to Tell Apart Fraternal Twins eEF1A1 and eEF1A2, and Their Respective Outfits.']"""

This technique was adopted in our center 10 years ago. With improving diagnostic accuracy of index prostate cancer lesions and a low side-effect profile, use of focal high intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) ablation is increasing.  Methods:   Patients were diagnosed using prostate specific antigen (PSA), multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging, and template transperineal biopsies. Focal ablation of significant cancer was performed with the Sonablate device. Follow-up consisted of magnetic resonance imaging scanning, PSA, validated questionnaires, biopsy for cause, and redo HIFU if required as part of the treatment strategy.  Results:   A total of 107 men underwent focal HIFU. In total, 88% had intermediate/high risk disease, and the mean pre-HIFU PSA was 7.7. A total of 31% had high volume Gleason 6 disease, 55% had Gleason 3+4 disease, and 13% had Gleason ≥ 4+3 disease. In total, 54 men received a hemiablation, 10 a focal ablation, and 43 a quadrant ablation. Median follow-up was 30 months, subjects' PSA dropped to an average 71% nadir. A total of 8% had biochemical recurrence and 11% required adjuvant treatment. Freedom from additional procedures for clinically significant recurrent disease, including redo-HIFU, was 85.5%. Postoperative complications included 1% new use of pads, 1.9% urethral stricture, 2.8% post-HIFU TURP, and new onset ED of 14%.

Aberrant activation of ERK/MEK and PI3K/AKT signaling pathways plays an important role in subsets of patients with CRPC. The role of protocadherin 7 (PCDH7) in modulating these signaling pathways is investigated for the first time in PCa in the present investigation.  Methods:   PCDH7 expression was analyzed in CRPC/neuroendocrine prostate cancer (NEPC) dataset. Protein expression was assessed by Western blotting and immunohistochemistry, and messenger RNA (mRNA) by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Small hairpin ribonucleic acid was used to knockdown PCDH7. Colony formation, cell migration, and invasion studies were done using standard protocols.  Results:   PCDH7 amplification/mRNA upregulation was observed in 41% of patients in CRPC/NEPC dataset. PCDH7 was also overexpressed in CRPC cells. Increased PCDH protein expression was observed during tumor progression in PCa tissues and in TRAMP mice. Epidermal growth factor treatment resulted in aberrant activation of ERK/AKT. Knockdown of PCDH7 decreased ERK, AKT, and RB phosphorylation and reduced colony formation, decreased cell invasion, and cell migration.

However, the existence of these cells continues to be questioned, and few methods exist for viable DTC isolation. Therefore, we sought to develop novel approaches to identify and, if detected, analyze localized PCa patient DTCs.  Methods:   We used fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) to isolate a putative DTC population, which was negative for CD45, CD235a, alkaline phosphatase, and CD34, and strongly expressed EPCAM. We examined tumor cell content by bulk cell RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) and whole-exome sequencing after whole genome amplification. We also enriched for BM DTCs with α-EPCAM immunomagnetic beads and performed quantitative reverse trancriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) for PCa markers.  Results:   At a threshold of 4 cells per million BM cells, the putative DTC population was present in 10 of 58 patients (17%) with localized PCa, 4 of 8 patients with metastatic PCa of varying disease control, and 1 of 8 patients with no known cancer, and was positively correlated with patients' plasma PSA values. RNA-Seq analysis of the putative DTC population collected from samples above (3 patients) and below (5 patients) the threshold of 4 putative DTCs per million showed increased expression of PCa marker genes in 4 of 8 patients with localized PCa, but not the one normal donor who had the putative DTC population present. Whole-exome sequencing also showed the presence of single nucleotide polymorphisms and structural variants in the gene characteristics of PCa in 2 of 3 localized PCa patients. To examine the likely contaminating cell types, we used a myeloid colony formation assay, differential counts of cell smears, and analysis of the RNA-Seq data using the CIBERSORT algorithm, which most strongly suggested the presence of B-cell lineages as a contaminant. Finally, we used EPCAM enrichment and qRT-PCR for PCa markers to estimate DTC prevalence and found evidence of DTCs in 21 of 44 samples (47%).

Caveolae have an important role in cell functioning, signaling, and disease. In the absence of CAVIN1/PTRF, Cav1 forms non-caveolar membrane domains called scaffolds. In this work, we train machine learning models to automatically distinguish between caveolae and scaffolds from single molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) data. We apply machine learning algorithms to discriminate biological structures from SMLM data. Our work is the first that is leveraging machine learning approaches (including deep learning models) to automatically identifying biological structures from SMLM data. In particular, we develop and compare three binary classification methods to identify whether or not a given 3D cluster of Cav1 proteins is a caveolae. The first uses a random forest classifier applied to 28 hand-crafted/designed features, the second uses a convolutional neural net (CNN) applied to a projection of the point clouds onto three planes, and the third uses a PointNet model, a recent development that can directly take point clouds as its input. We validate our methods on a dataset of super-resolution microscopy images of PC3 prostate cancer cells labeled for Cav1. Specifically, we have images from two cell populations: 10 PC3 and 10 CAVIN1/PTRF-transfected PC3 cells (PC3-PTRF cells) that form caveolae. We obtained a balanced set of 1714 different cellular structures. Our results show that both the random forest on hand-designed features and the deep learning approach achieve high accuracy in distinguishing the intrinsic features of the caveolae and non-caveolae biological structures. More specifically, both random forest and deep CNN classifiers achieve classification accuracy reaching 94% on our test set, while the PointNet model only reached 83% accuracy.

However, the cancer cells adept their ability to suppress macrophage activity by secreting compounds/proteins through unknown mechanisms and train these macrophages to aid in tumorigenesis. These macrophages are commonly known as tumor associated macrophages (TAM). In this study, our goal was to find out key regulatory molecules involved in this conversion of cancer-fighting macrophages to cancer friendly macrophages. We used African American(AA) patient derived established human prostate cancer cells along with the human derived macrophages followed by Affymetrix cDNA microarray analysis. Microarray analysis of the PCa cell exposed macrophages revealed appreciable decrease in mRNA expression of several genes associated with phagocytosis process. Aberrant expression of several noncoding RNAs that control the expression of such phagocytosis associated molecules were also evident. Increased expression of oncogenic miR such as, miR-148, 615, 515, 130, 139 and markedly decreased expression of tumor suppressive miR's MiR-3130, let7c,101,103, 383 were noted.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the ""real-world"" practice of 18F-Choline PET/CT in patients with prostate cancer and its potential impacts on therapeutic strategy.  Methods and materials:   This is a retrospective multicenter observational study including 265 consecutive men who underwent 18F-Choline PET/CT for prostate cancer between November 2014 and November 2015. Primary outcome was impact on therapeutic strategy. Secondary outcomes were sensitivity of the 18F-Choline PET/CT and predictive factors associated with positive scans. Statistical analyses comprised Student's t test for continuous variables or chi-squared test for qualitative variables.  Results:   Median PSA level at the time of PET/CT was 4.19 ng/ml. The decision to perform PET/CT was made after multidisciplinary discussion in 29.8% of cases; most were prescribed by urologists (50.2% of cases). Three main indications were concerned: biochemical recurrence after local treatment (61.1%), initial staging (26.0%), or at the time of progression to castration-resistance (12.9%). Upon biochemical recurrence, 18F-Choline PET/CT allowed identification of ≥1 site(s) with a sensitivity of 80.9%. In multivariate analysis, predictive factors associated with 18F-Choline PET/CT sensitivity were serum PSA level and local treatment type in cases of biochemical recurrence, and PSA doubling time and Gleason score in case of initial staging. 18F-Choline PET/CT results allowed restaging and change in therapeutic strategy in 58.1% of all combined indications.  Conclusions:   Indications of 18F-Choline PET/CT were varied. The detection rate of metastatic lesions was suitable, especially when PSA rate was >1 ng/mL.

Objective:   Evaluation of heterogeneity of effect between LATITUDE high- and low-risk M1 prostate cancer patients receiving ADT + AAP in the STAMPEDE trial.  Design, setting, and participants:   A post hoc subgroup analysis of the 2017 STAMPEDE ""abiraterone comparison"". Staging scans for M1 patients contemporaneously randomised to ADT or ADT + AAP within the STAMPEDE trial were evaluated centrally and blind to treatment assignment. Stratification was by risk according to the criteria set out in the LATITUDE trial. Exploratory subgroup stratification incorporated the CHAARTED criteria.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   The primary outcome measure was overall survival (OS) and the secondary outcome measure was failure-free survival (FFS). Further exploratory analysis evaluated clinical skeletal-related events, progression-free survival (PFS), and prostate cancer-specific death. Standard Cox-regression and Kaplan-Meier survival estimates were employed for analysis.  Results and limitations:   A total of 901 M1 STAMPEDE patients were evaluated after exclusions. Of the patients, 428 (48%) were identified as having a low risk and 473 (52%) a high risk. Patients receiving ADT + AAP had significantly improved OS (low-risk hazard ratio [HR]: 0.66, 95% confidence interval or CI [0.44-0.98]) and FFS (low-risk HR: 0.24, 95% CI [0.17-0.33]) compared with ADT alone. Heterogeneity of effect was not seen between low- and high-risk groups for OS or FFS. For OS benefit in low risk, the number needed to treat was four times greater than that for high risk.

To reduce unwanted variation in biobanks and clinical studies, it is important to determine the effect of external factors on metabolic profiles of biofluids. In this study we examined the effect of sample collection and sample processing procedures on NMR measured serum lipoproteins and small-molecule metabolites in serum and urine, using a cohort of men diagnosed with either prostate cancer or benign prostatic hyperplasia. We determined day-to-day reliability of metabolites by systematic sample collection at two different days, in both fasting and non-fasting conditions. Study participants received prostate massage the first day to assess the differences between urine with and without prostate secretions. Further, metabolic differences between first-void and mid-stream urine samples, and the effect of centrifugation of urine samples before storage were assessed. Our results show that day-to-day reliability is highly variable between metabolites in both serum and urine, while lipoprotein subfractions possess high reliability. Further, fasting status clearly influenced the metabolite concentrations, demonstrating the importance of keeping this condition constant within a study cohort. Day-to-day reliabilities were however comparable in fasting and non-fasting samples. Urine sampling procedures such as sampling of first-void or mid-stream urine, and centrifugation or not before sample storage, were shown to only have minimal effect on the overall metabolic profile, and is thus unlikely to constitute a confounder in clinical studies utilizing NMR derived metabolomics.""","""['Guro F Giskeødegård', 'Trygve Andreassen', 'Helena Bertilsson', 'May-Britt Tessem', 'Tone F Bathen']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Anal Chim Acta""","""['Translational Metabolomics of Head Injury: Exploring Dysfunctional Cerebral Metabolism with Ex Vivo NMR Spectroscopy-Based Metabolite Quantification.', 'The key points in the pre-analytical procedures of blood and urine samples in metabolomics studies.', 'NMR-Based Prostate Cancer Metabolomics.', 'Integration of Metabolomics and Transcriptomics Reveals Major Metabolic Pathways and Potential Biomarker Involved in Prostate Cancer.', 'Dominant components of the Thoroughbred metabolome characterised by (1) H-nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy: A metabolite atlas of common biofluids.', 'Quantitative Serum NMR Spectroscopy Stratifies COVID-19 Patients and Sheds Light on Interfaces of Host Metabolism and the Immune Response with Cytokines and Clinical Parameters.', 'A Comprehensive Mass Spectrometry-Based Workflow for Clinical Metabolomics Cohort Studies.', 'Effect of Delayed Centrifugation on the Levels of NMR-Measured Lipoproteins and Metabolites in Plasma and Serum Samples.', 'Longitudinal Changes in Circulating Metabolites and Lipoproteins After Breast Cancer Treatment.', 'Optimization of training and measurement protocol for eNose analysis of urine headspace aimed at prostate cancer diagnosis.']"""

This study assessed the geometric accuracy and precision of KIM used to guide patient treatments in the TROG 15.01 multi-institutional Stereotactic Prostate Ablative Radiotherapy with KIM trial and investigated factors affecting accuracy and precision.  Methods:   Fractions from 44 patients with prostate cancer treated using KIM-guided SBRT were analyzed across four institutions, on two different linear accelerator models and two different beam models (6 MV and 10 MV FFF). The geometric accuracy and precision of KIM was assessed from over 33 000 images (translation) and over 9000 images (rotation) by comparing the real-time measured motion to retrospective kV/MV triangulation. Factors potentially affecting accuracy, including contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) of kV images and incorrect marker segmentation, were also investigated.  Results:   The geometric accuracy and precision did not depend on treatment institution, beam model or motion magnitude, but was correlated with gantry angle. The centroid geometric accuracy and precision of the KIM system for SABR prostate treatments was 0.0 ± 0.5, 0.0 ± 0.4 and 0.1 ± 0.3 mm for translation, and -0.1 ± 0.6°, -0.1 ± 1.4° and -0.1 ± 1.0° for rotation in the AP, LR and SI directions respectively. Centroid geometric error exceeded 2 mm for 0.05% of this dataset. No significant relationship was found between large geometric error and CNR or marker segmentation correlation.

In this phase 1 study, safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), and efficacy of apalutamide were evaluated in Japanese patients with mCRPC.  Methods:   In this open-label, multi-center study, patients received apalutamide 240 mg (once-daily, orally) for first 1 week (PK week) during which PK parameters were assessed. 1 week later (Cycle 1 Day1), after reassessing safety, continuous daily dosing (4 weeks/cycle; once-daily orally) was initiated. Endpoints evaluated were: safety, tolerability, PK and antitumour efficacy of apalutamide. Dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) were evaluated during PK week and Cycle 1.  Results:   All six patients received apalutamide. The most common treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were abdominal discomfort, nasopharyngitis, dysgeusia, rash, and hot flush [2/6 patients (33.3%) each]. No death or DLTs were reported. Grade 3 TEAEs were spinal-cord compression and renal disorder (1/6 patient each). In continuous daily dosing period, PK steady-state of apalutamide was reached approximately by week 4. A significant accumulation of apalutamide was observed (mean accumulation index 3.55), based on AUC0-24. Median (range) serum prostate-specific antigen level decreased from 54.42 (8.92-310.11) ng/mL at baseline to 11.70 (0.37-47.74) ng/mL at week 12 with ≥ 50% reduction in 4/6 (66.7%) patients and 90% reduction in 2/6 (33.3%) patients.  Conclusion:   Apalutamide had manageable safety profile, without any DLT or any new safety signals, and favourable efficacy in Japanese mCRPC patients.

Screening of a cohort of 659 patients (380 Caucasian American; 250 African American, and 29 patients from other races) revealed that the KLK4-KLKP1 is expressed in about 32% of prostate cancer patients. Correlative analysis with other ETS gene fusions and SPINK1 revealed a concomitant expression pattern of KLK4-KLKP1 with ERG and a mutually exclusive expression pattern with SPINK1, ETV1, ETV4, and ETV5. Development of an antibody specific to KLK4-KLKP1 fusion protein confirmed the expression of the full-length KLK4-KLKP1 protein in prostate tissues. The in vitro and in vivo functional assays to study the oncogenic properties of KLK4-KLKP1 confirmed its role in cell proliferation, cell invasion, intravasation, and tumor formation. Presence of strong ERG and AR binding sites located at the fusion junction in KLK4-KLKP1 suggests that the fusion gene is regulated by ERG and AR. Correlative analysis of clinical data showed an association of KLK4-KLKP1 with lower preoperative PSA values and in young men (<50 years) with prostate cancer. Screening of patient urine samples showed that KLK4-KLKP1 can be detected noninvasively in urine.

This study aimed to investigate patient and primary care based health professionals' perspectives of what constitutes 'good care' for men with prostate cancer, including limiting or facilitating factors.  Method:   Semi-structured interviews were conducted with ten patients and eight primary care based healthcare professionals and thematically analysed in collaboration with a patient representative group.  Results:   Good care was identified by patient participants, with aspects of communication, including information, active participation, sensitivity of approach and context being highlighted. Healthcare professionals also prioritised communication as the basis of good care and recognised the benefits of locally based services.  Conclusions:   Treatments in prostate and other cancers continue to improve with corresponding increases in survival.

Repositioning is enough for minimal interfractional deformations. Therefore, determining indications for OLAR is desirable. We introduce a method to rapidly determine the need for OLAR by analyzing the Jacobian determinant histogram (JDH) obtained from deformable image registration between reference (planning) and daily images.  Methods and materials:   The proposed method was developed and tested based on daily computed tomography (CT) scans acquired during image guided radiation therapy for prostate cancer using an in-room CT scanner. Deformable image registration between daily and reference CT scans was performed. JDHs were extracted from the prostate and a uniform surrounding 10-mm expansion. A classification tree was trained to determine JDH metrics to predict the need for OLAR for a daily CT set. Sixty daily CT scans from 12 randomly selected prostate cases were used as the training data set, with dosimetric plans for both OLAR and repositioning used to determine their class. The resulting classification tree was tested using an independent data set of 45 daily CT scans from 9 other patients with 5 CT scans each.  Results:   Of a total of 27 JDH metrics tested, 5 were identified predicted whether OLAR was substantially superior to repositioning for a given fraction. A decision tree was constructed using the obtained metrics from the training set. This tree correctly identified all cases in the test set where benefits of OLAR were obvious.  Conclusions:   A decision tree based on JDH metrics to quickly determine the necessity of online replanning based on the image of the day without segmentation was determined using a machine learning process. The process can be automated and completed within a minute, allowing users to quickly decide which fractions require OLAR.""","""['Sara N Lim', 'Ergun E Ahunbay', 'Haidy Nasief', 'Cheng Zheng', 'Colleen Lawton', 'X Allen Li']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Pract Radiat Oncol""","""['Auto-detection of necessity for MRI-guided online adaptive replanning using a machine learning classifier.', 'Predicting necessity of daily online adaptive replanning based on wavelet image features for MRI guided adaptive radiation therapy.', 'Assessment and management of interfractional variations in daily diagnostic-quality-CT guided prostate-bed irradiation after prostatectomy.', 'Technical Note: Acceleration of online adaptive replanning with automation and parallel operations.', 'SU-E-T-579: Dosimetric Benefits of Online Adaptive Replanning for Post-Operative Radiation Therapy of Prostate Bed.', 'Deep learning based automatic contour refinement for inaccurate auto-segmentation in MR-guided adaptive radiotherapy.', 'Auto-detection of necessity for MRI-guided online adaptive replanning using a machine learning classifier.', 'Predicting necessity of daily online adaptive replanning based on wavelet image features for MRI guided adaptive radiation therapy.', 'Adaptive Radiation Therapy (ART) Strategies and Technical Considerations: A State of the ART Review From NRG Oncology.']"""

Methods and materials:   Appropriate indications for IMRT, SRS, SABR, and PBT by disease site (and particular clinical setting thereof) were extracted from the most recently published ASTRO MPs and published coverage policies (2019 editions) of the 5 carriers. After tabulation, concordance between ASTRO MPs and insurance policies were calculated for each modality.  Results:   All 5 insurer policies supported IMRT for neoplasms of the central nervous system, head/neck, hepatopancreaticobiliary, anal, and prostate cancers. The least covered diseases were retroperitoneal tumors (n = 0 carriers) and bladder cancer (n = 1). For SRS, all carriers covered benign brain tumors, brain metastases, arteriovenous malformations, and trigeminal neuralgia. None of the insurance carriers covered SRS for medically refractory epilepsy. For SABR, primary liver, lung, and low- or intermediate-risk prostate cancer were covered by all insurers, and none allowed SABR for primary biliary neoplasms. Only one insurance carrier each covered SABR for primary/metastatic adrenal disease and primary renal cancer. All carriers approved PBT for ocular melanoma, skull base tumors, and pediatric malignancies. The ASTRO MPs listed 4 PBT scenarios (ie, spinal disease, retroperitoneal sarcoma, head/neck neoplasms, and patients with genetic radiosensitivity syndromes) not covered by any insurer. Concordance between insurance carriers and ASTRO MPs was 67.8% for IMRT, 72.0% for SRS, 58.4% for SABR, and 41.8% for PBT (P = .005).  Conclusions:   Coverage guidelines for IMRT, SRS, SABR, and PBT vary across 5 major insurance providers and may be substantially discordant compared with ASTRO coverage guidelines.

In our current study, we investigated the oxidative stress mediated cell death mechanism of a NSAID derivative NCX4040 (a nitric oxide (NO) releasing form of aspirin) in castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) PC3 cell line. Our data revealed that NCX4040 is more potent than its parent compound aspirin or NO releasing compound DETA NONOate. NCX4040 significantly induced hydrogen peroxide formation with ensuing oxidative stress and mitochondrial depolarization resulting in lipid peroxidation, cell cycle arrest, inhibition of colony growth and induction of apoptosis in PC3 cells. Moreover, NCX4040 inhibited migration potential of PC3 cells by depolymerizing F-actin and promoting anoikis. Interestingly, elevated levels of NADPH oxidase 1 (NOX1), superoxide dismutase (SOD) 1 and 2 were observed upon NCX4040 treatment. However, down regulation of anti-apoptotic markers B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl2) and anti-oxidant thioredoxin reductase 1 (TXNRD1) expression were observed. In addition, NCX4040 down regulated cyclin D1 expression in PC3 cells further supporting the anticancer effect of NCX4040. Western blot analysis revealed that significant down regulation of key anti-apoptotic markers such as cellular inhibitor of apoptosis protein-1 (cIAP1), X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis (XIAP), survivin, and Cellular-Myc (c-Myc). On the other hand, NCX4040-treated cells showed upregulation of phosho histone H2AX (pH2AX), cleaved caspase3 and cleaved Poly [ADP-ribose] polymerase 1 (PARP1). Taken together, our data demonstrate that NCX4040 treatment enhances free radical formation which in turn induces oxidative stress leading to mitochondrial mediated cell death in metastatic PC3 cells.""","""['Somaiah Chinnapaka', 'Guoxing Zheng', 'Aoshuang Chen', 'Gnanasekar Munirathinam']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Free Radic Biol Med""","""['Reconsidering the Role of Cyclooxygenase Inhibition in the Chemotherapeutic Value of NO-Releasing Aspirins for Lung Cancer.', 'Aryl Hydrocarbon Receptor Suppresses the Prostate Cancer LNCaP Cell Growth and Invasion by Promoting DNA Damage Response Under Oxidative Stress.', 'Eprinomectin, a novel semi-synthetic macrocylic lactone is cytotoxic to PC3 metastatic prostate cancer cells via inducing apoptosis.', 'A systematic review of p53 regulation of oxidative stress in skeletal muscle.', 'Therapeutic value of quinazoline-based compounds in prostate cancer.', 'Eprinomectin: a derivative of ivermectin suppresses growth and metastatic phenotypes of prostate cancer cells by targeting the β-catenin signaling pathway.', 'Electrochemical-Based Sensing Platforms for Detection of Glucose and H2O2 by Porous Metal-Organic Frameworks: A Review of Status and Prospects.', 'Polygodial, a Sesquiterpene Dialdehyde, Activates Apoptotic Signaling in Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer Cell Lines by Inducing Oxidative Stress.', 'Hemicellulosic Polysaccharides From Bamboo Leaves Promoted by Phosphotungstic Acids and Its Attenuation of Oxidative Stress in HepG2 Cells.', 'The Etiology and Pathophysiology Genesis of Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia and Prostate Cancer: A New Perspective.']"""

We aimed to compare readmission rates between limited and extended LND during open radical prostatectomy (ORP) and robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP).  Materials and methods:   We conducted a prospective trial of 3,706 eligible patients comparing ORP vs. RARP (LAPPRO). Six hundred and twenty-seven underwent concomitant LND. Data were retrieved for readmissions within 90 days from surgery from the Swedish Patient Registry. Causes for readmissions were classified according to the modified Clavien-Dindo classification system. We estimated risks for readmission stratified by type of LND and surgical approach.  Results:   We recorded 107 readmissions in 90 patients. The overall readmission rate was 14% (90/627). In the open group, extended LND had a higher, but not statistically significant readmission rate of 18% compared to 11% after limited LND (95%CI 0.87-3.01). In the robot-assisted group, readmissions after extended LND did not differ from limited LND (15% vs. 18%, 95%CI 0.49-1.61). RARP with limited LND showed a higher risk for any (RR 1.98, 95%CI [1.02-3.81]) as well as Clavien-Dindo grade 1 to 2 readmissions (RR 2.49, 95%CI [1.10-5.63]) compared to open approach with limited LND. Robot-assisted extended LND reduced the risk for Clavien-Dindo grade 3 to 5 complications leading to readmissions compared to the open approach by 59% (RR 0.41, 95%CI [0.19-0.87]).

Conventional risk assessment of POPs focuses on individual compounds. However, in real life, individuals are exposed to many compounds simultaneously. This might lead to combinatorial effects whereby the global effect of the mixture is different from the effect of the single elements or subgroups. POP mixtures may act as endocrine disruptors via the androgen receptor (AR) and potentially contribute to PCa development.  Aim:   To determine the endocrine disrupting activity of a POP mixture and sub-mixtures based upon exposure levels detected in a human Scandinavian population, on AR transactivation and translocation in vitro.  Materials and methods:   The Total POP mixture combined 29 chemicals modelled on the exposure profile of a Scandinavian population and 6 sub-mixtures: brominated (Br), chlorinated (Cl), Cl + Br, perfluorinated (PFAA), PFAA + Br, PFAA + Cl, ranging from 1/10× to 500× relative to what is found in human blood. Transactivation was measured by reporter gene assay (RGA) and translocation activity was measured by high content analysis (HCA), each using stably transfected AR model cell lines.  Results:   No agonist activity in terms of transactivation and translocation was detected for any POP mixtures. In the presence of testosterone the Cl + Br mixture at 100× and 500× blood level antagonised AR transactivation, whereas the PFAA mixture at blood level increased AR transactivation (P < 0.05). In the presence of testosterone the Cl and PFAA + Br mixtures at 1/10×, 1×, and 50× blood level antagonised AR translocation (P < 0.05).  Conclusion:   Taken together, some combinations of POP mixtures can interfere with AR translocation. However, in the transactivation assay, these combinations did not affect gene transactivation. Other POP combinations were identified here as modulators of AR-induced gene transactivation without affecting AR translocation. Thus, to fully evaluate the effect of environmental toxins on AR signalling, both types of assays need to be applied.""","""['J McComb', 'I G Mills', 'M Muller', 'H F Berntsen', 'K E Zimmer', 'E Ropstad', 'S Verhaegen', 'L Connolly']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Environ Int""","""['Effects of a human-based mixture of persistent organic pollutants on the in vivo exposed cerebellum and cerebellar neuronal cultures exposed in vitro.', 'A Human Relevant Defined Mixture of Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs) Affects In Vitro Secretion of Glucagon-Like Peptide 1 (GLP-1), but Does Not Affect Translocation of Its Receptor.', 'Effects of defined mixtures of persistent organic pollutants (POPs) on multiple cellular responses in the human hepatocarcinoma cell line, HepG2, using high content analysis screening.', 'The design of an environmentally relevant mixture of persistent organic pollutants for use in in vivo and in vitro studies.', 'Biomonitoring and hormone-disrupting effect biomarkers of persistent organic pollutants in vitro and ex vivo.', 'A Realistic Mixture of Persistent Organic Pollutants Affects Zebrafish Development, Behavior, and Specifically Eye Formation by Inhibiting the Condensin I Complex.', 'Metal-Organic Frameworks-Based Sensors for Food Safety.']"""

Methods and materials:   We enrolled patients who had a controlled primary malignancy with 1 to 5 metastatic lesions, with good performance status and life expectancy >6 months. We randomized in a 1:2 ratio between standard of care (SOC) treatment (SOC arm) and SOC plus SABR to all metastatic lesions (SABR arm). QoL was measured using the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General. QoL changes over time and between groups were assessed with linear mixed modeling.  Results:   Ninety-nine patients were randomized. Median age was 68 years (range, 43-89), and 60% were male. The most common primary tumor types were breast (n = 18), lung (n = 18), colorectal (n = 18), and prostate (n = 16). Most patients (n = 92) had 1 to 3 metastases. Median follow-up was 26 months. Because of the previously reported inferior survival of the SOC arm, the time for attrition in QoL respondents to <10% of subjects was shorter in the SOC versus SABR arm (30 vs 42 months). In the whole cohort, QoL declined over time after randomization: There were significant declines in total Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General score over time compared with baseline (P < .001) owing to declines in physical and functional subscales (both P < .001), with no declines in social and emotional subscales. However, the magnitudes of decline were small, and clinically meaningful changes were not seen at most time points. Comparison between arms showed no differences in QoL between the SABR and SOC arms in total score (P = .42) or in the physical (P = .98), functional (P = .59), emotional (P = .82), or social (P = .17) subscales.  Conclusions:   For patients with oligometastases, average QoL declines slowly over time regardless of treatment approach, although the changes are small in magnitude.

The aim was to check the intensity of Ga-PSMA-11 uptake and magnetic resonance (MR) features of superior cervical ganglia (SCG) on PET/MR imaging.  Methods:   In 89 patients 106 SCG were reliably identified on Ga-PSMA-11 PET/MR. For each SCG, qualitative assessment (visual subjective avidity, diffusion restriction, shape, and the presence of central hypointensity) and quantitative measurements [dimensions, maximal standardized uptake value (SUVmax), mean apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC)] were performed.  Results:   Mean SUVmax in SCG amounted to 1.88 ± 0.63 (range: 0.87-4.42), with considerable metabolic activity (SUVmax ≥ 2) in 37.7% of SCG; mean thickness was 3.18 ± 1.08 mm. In subjective visual evaluation, SCG avidity was classified as mistakable or potentially mistakable with underlying malignancy in 32.1% of cases. Mean ADC values amounted 1749.83 ± 428.83 × 10mm/s. In visual assessment, 74.5% of ganglia showed moderate to high diffusion restriction. An oval or longitudinal shape on transverse MR plane was presented by 59.4% of SCG. The central hypointensity was detected on MR T2-weighted images only in 10.4% of SCG.  Conclusion:   SCG, similar to other sympathetic ganglia, show Ga-PSMA-11 uptake. SCG avidity may be of significance, especially in view of frequently occurring SCG oval or longitudinal shape, and moderate to high diffusion restriction in visual assessment, potentially suggesting malignancy on transverse MR plane.

Herein, we report on our oncological and functional outcomes after 10 years of surgical experience.  Materials and methods:   Prospective data from 1,034 RARP cases performed by two high-volume experienced surgeons at two academic centers were collected from October 2006 to June 2017. Preoperative characteristics, surgical, oncological and functional outcomes were assessed up to 72 months postoperative.  Results:   D'Amico risk distribution was 26.1%, 59.8% and 14.1% for low, intermediate and high risk prostate cancer. Median (interquartile range) operative time, blood loss and hospital stay were 170 minutes (145-200), 200 mL (150-300) and 1day (1-1), respectively and 1.4% received blood transfusion. Intraoperative complications occurred in 3.8%. Postoperatively, 32 (3.1%) and 138 (13.3%) men harbored major (Clavien III-IV) and minor complications (Clavien I-II), respectively.

Materials and methods:   A prospective study was initiated in 2007 at Center for Prostate Disease Research Multicenter National Database sites. Longitudinal patterns in HRQoL from baseline (pre-treatment) to 5 years post-diagnosis were examined for patients with high- and intermediate-risk prostate cancer, treated by radical prostatectomy (RP) or external beam radiation therapy (EBRT). Change in HRQoL was modeled using linear regression models fit with generalized estimating equations. The probability of maintaining HRQoL was compared between patients receiving RP only versus RP with secondary treatment.  Results:   Of 445 men with high- and intermediate-risk prostate cancer, 228 underwent RP and 143 had EBRT± androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). Fifty received secondary therapy (EBRT and/or ADT or chemotherapy) after RP. RP patients showed a greater decline over time in sexual function and bother and urinary function compared to EBRT±ADT patients. Patients who had secondary therapy after RP were less likely to maintain their HRQoL compared to those who had RP alone. These differences were most pronounced for sexual and hormonal function.  Conclusions:   Prostate cancer patients experience significant declines in HRQoL after primary therapy. Additional secondary therapy after RP, in the form of EBRT and/or ADT, appears to be responsible for further deterioration in HRQoL outcomes.""","""['Mazen Alsinnawi', 'Jennifer Cullen', 'Lauren M Hurwitz', 'Katherine E Levie', 'John F Burns', 'Inger L Rosner', 'Timothy C Brand', 'Sean Stroup', 'Joseph R Sterbis', 'Kevin Rice', 'Galen Conti', 'Christopher R Porter']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Can J Urol""","""['A prospective study of health-related quality-of-life outcomes for patients with low-risk prostate cancer managed by active surveillance or radiation therapy.', 'A prospective quality-of-life study in men with clinically localized prostate carcinoma treated with radical prostatectomy, external beam radiotherapy, or interstitial brachytherapy.', 'A Comparison Between Low-Dose-Rate Brachytherapy With or Without Androgen Deprivation, External Beam Radiation Therapy With or Without Androgen Deprivation, and Radical Prostatectomy With or Without Adjuvant or Salvage Radiation Therapy for High-Risk Prostate Cancer.', 'The effect of androgen deprivation therapy on health-related quality of life in men with prostate cancer.', 'Salvage therapy for locally recurrent prostate cancer after radiation.', 'Health-related quality of life in patients newly diagnosed with prostate cancer: CAPLIFE study.']"""

Objective:   To determine whether changes in hospital funding policy aimed at improving health care quality and value were associated with changes in the management of localized prostate cancer or the characteristics of patients receiving radical prostatectomy (RP) for localized prostate cancer.  Design, setting, and participants:   This population-based, interrupted time series study used linked population-based administrative data regarding adults in Ontario with incidental localized prostate cancer and those who underwent RP for localized prostate cancer. Patients who underwent RP were compared with patients who underwent surgical procedures for localized renal cell carcinoma, which was not included in the policy change but was subjected to similar secular trends and potential confounders. Monthly outcomes were analyzed using interventional autoregressive integrated moving average models. Data were collected from January 2011 to November 2017 and analyzed in January 2019.  Exposures:   Funding policy change in April 2015 from flexible block funding for all hospital-based care to prespecified payment amounts per procedure for treatment of localized prostate cancer, coupled with the dissemination of a diagnosis-specific handbook outlining best practices.  Main outcomes and measures:   Initial management (RP vs radiation therapy vs active surveillance) and tumor risk profiles per management strategy among incident cases of localized prostate cancer. Additional outcomes were case volume, mean length of stay, proportion of patients returning to hospital or emergency department within 30 days, proportion of patients older than 65 years, mean Charlson Comorbidity Index, and proportion of minimally invasive surgical procedures among patients undergoing RP for localized prostate cancer.  Results:   A total of 33 128 patients with incident localized prostate cancer (median [interquartile range (IQR)] age, 67 [61-73] years; median [IQR] cases per monthly observation interval, 466 [420-516]), 17 159 patients who received radical prostatectomy (median [IQR] age, 63 [58-68] years; median [IQR] cases per monthly observation interval, 209 [183-225]), and 5762 individuals who underwent surgery for renal cell carcinoma (median [IQR] age, 62 [53-70] years; median [IQR] cases per monthly observation interval, 71 [61-77]) were identified. By the end of the observation period, radical prostatectomy and radiation therapy were used in comparable proportions (30.3% and 28.9%, respectively) and included only a small fraction of low-risk patients (6.4% and 2.9%, respectively). No statistically significant association of the funding policy change with most outcomes was found.  Conclusions and relevance:   The implementation of funding reform for hospitals offering RP was not associated with changes in the management of localized prostate cancer, although it may have encouraged more appropriate selection of patients for RP. Mostly preexisting trends toward guideline-conforming practice were observed. Co-occurring policy changes and/or guideline revisions may have weakened signals from the policy change.""","""['Marian S Wettstein', 'Karen S Palmer', 'Girish S Kulkarni', 'J Michael Paterson', 'Vicki Ling', 'Lauren Lapointe-Shaw', 'Alvin H Li', 'Adalsteinn Brown', 'Monica Taljaard', 'Noah Ivers']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""JAMA Netw Open""","""['Effects of quality-based procedure hospital funding reform in Ontario, Canada: An interrupted time series study.', 'Association Between Radiation Therapy, Surgery, or Observation for Localized Prostate Cancer and Patient-Reported Outcomes After 3 Years.', 'Pathological stage distribution in patients treated with radical prostatectomy reflecting the need for protocol-based active surveillance: results from a contemporary European patient cohort.', 'Prostate-Specific Antigen-Based Screening for Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Evidence Review for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force Internet.', 'Management of localised prostate cancer: watchful waiting, surgery or radiation therapy, depending on the natural course, which is often relatively slow.']"""

The androgen receptor (AR) axis plays an important role in castration resistance. Emerging studies showed that the lysine demethylase KDM4B is a key molecule in AR signaling and turnover, and autophagy plays an important role in CRPC. However, little is known about whether KDM4B promotes CRPC progression by regulating autophagy. Here we used an androgen-independent LNCaP (LNCaP-AI) cell line to assay aberrant KDM4B expression using qPCR and western blot analysis and investigated the function of KDM4B in regulating cell proliferation. We found that KDM4B was markedly increased in LNCaP-AI cells compared with LNCaP cells. KDM4B level was significantly correlated with the Gleason score in PCa tissues. In vitro, KDM4B overexpression in CRPC cells promoted cell proliferation, whereas knockdown of KDM4B significantly inhibited cell proliferation. Upregulated KDM4B contributed to activate Wnt/β-catenin signaling and autophagy. Moreover, KDM4B activated autophagy by regulating the Wnt/β-catenin signaling. Finally, we demonstrated that autophagy inhibition attenuated KDM4B-induced CRPC cell proliferation. Our results provided novel insights into the function of KDM4B-driven CRPC development and indicated that KDM4B may be served as a potential target for CRPC therapy.""","""['Jianjun Sha', 'Qing Han', 'Chenfei Chi', 'Yinjie Zhu', 'Jiahua Pan', 'Baijun Dong', 'Yiran Huang', 'Weiliang Xia', 'Wei Xue']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""J Cell Physiol""","""['Targeting KDM4B that coactivates c-Myc-regulated metabolism to suppress tumor growth in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Histone lysine demethylase KDM4B regulates the alternative splicing of the androgen receptor in response to androgen deprivation.', 'Therapeutic targeting of histone lysine demethylase KDM4B blocks the growth of castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Interplay Between SOX9, Wnt/β-Catenin and Androgen Receptor Signaling in Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Androgen receptor: what we know and what we expect in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'siRNA-mediated stathmin1 silencing inhibits proliferation of prostate carcinoma cell line.', 'Histone demethylase KDM4B contributes to advanced clear cell renal carcinoma and association with copy number variations and cell cycle progression.', 'Targeting epigenetic regulators to overcome drug resistance in cancers.', 'Novel insights into the angiogenic function of JMJD2B in diabetic hind limb ischemia: involvement of activating Wnt/β-catenin pathway.', 'Epigenetic and post-translational modifications in autophagy: biological functions and therapeutic targets.']"""

Methods:   Within the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results database (2004-2015), we identified 6975 patients (4806 men and 2169 women) with metastatic clear cell renal carcinoma. Temporal trend analyses, logistic regression models, cumulative incidence plots, and competing-risk regression models were used.  Results:   Overall, 1450 men and 1018 women were unmarried (30.2% and 47.0%, respectively). In men, unmarried status was an independent predictor of lower cytoreductive nephrectomy rate (OR: 0.54), lower metastasectomy rate (OR: 0.70), and lower systemic therapy rate (OR: 0.70). Conversely, in women, unmarried status was an independent predictor of lower cytoreductive nephrectomy rate (OR: 0.63) and of lower systemic therapy rate (OR: 0.80), but not of lower metastasectomy rate (OR: 0.83; p = 0.12). In multivariable competing-risk regression analyses, unmarried status was an independent predictor of higher CSM in men (HR: 1.15), but not in women (HR 0.97, p = 0.6).

They also have roles in epithelial to mesenchymal transition and in carcinogenesis. Because lncRNAs may also have a role in thyroid cancer progression, we examined a group of thyroid tumors which included papillary thyroid carcinomas and anaplastic thyroid carcinomas to determine the specific lncRNAs that were upregulated during thyroid tumor progression. An RT2 Profiler PCR Array Human Cancer Pathway Finder consisting of 84 lncRNAs (Qiagen) and fresh tissues of normal thyroid, PTCs, and ATCs with gene expression profiling was used to determine genes upregulated and downregulated in ATCs. Two of the most highly upregulated genes, prostate cancer antigen 3 (PCA3) and HOX antisense intergenic RNA myeloid 1 (HOTAIRM1 or HAM-1), were selected for further studies using a thyroid tissue microarray(TMA) with formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues of normal thyroid (NT, n = 10), nodular goiters (NG, n = 10), follicular adenoma (FA, n = 32), follicular carcinoma (FCA, n = 28), papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC, n = 28), follicular variant of papillary thyroid carcinoma (FVPTC, n = 28), and anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (ATC, n = 10). TMA sections were analyzed by in situ hybridization (ISH) using RNAscope technology. The results of ISH analyses were imaged with Vectra imaging technology and quantified with Nuance® and inForm® software. The TMA analysis was validated by qRT-PCR using FFPE tissues for RNA preparation. Cultured thyroid carcinoma cell lines (n = 7) were also used to analyze for lncRNAs by qRT-PCR. The results showed 11 lncRNAs upregulated and 7 downregulated lncRNAs more than twofold in the ATCS compared with PTCs. Two of the upregulated lncRNAs, PCA3 and HAM-1, were analyzed on a thyroid carcinoma TMA. There was increased expression of both lncRNAs in ATCs and PTCs compared with NT after TMA analysis. qRT-PCR analyses showed increased expression of both lncRNAs in ATCs compared with NT and PTCs. Analyses of these lncRNAs from cultured thyroid carcinoma cell lines by qRT-PCR showed the highest levels of lncRNA expression in ATCs. TGF-β treatment of cultured PTC and ATC cells for 21 days led to increased expression of PCA3 lncRNA in both cell lines by day 14. These results show that the lncRNAs PCA3 and HAM-1 are upregulated during thyroid tumor development and progression and may function as oncogenes during tumor progression.""","""['Yanping Wang', 'Heather Hardin', 'Ying-Hsia Chu', 'Karla Esbona', 'Ranran Zhang', 'Ricardo V Lloyd']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Endocr Pathol""","""['Long Non-coding RNA Linc-ROR Is Upregulated in Papillary Thyroid Carcinoma.', 'In Situ Hybridization Analysis of miR-146b-5p and miR-21 in Thyroid Nodules: Diagnostic Implications.', 'MALAT1 Long Non-coding RNA Expression in Thyroid Tissues: Analysis by In Situ Hybridization and Real-Time PCR.', 'Evidence that one subset of anaplastic thyroid carcinomas are derived from papillary carcinomas due to BRAF and p53 mutations.', 'Expression of MicroRNAs in Thyroid Carcinoma.', 'Long non-coding RNA LINC00607 silencing exerts antioncogenic effects on thyroid cancer through the CASP9 Promoter methylation.', 'Role of Regulatory Non-Coding RNAs in Aggressive Thyroid Cancer: Prospective Applications of Neural Network Analysis.', 'Molecular Pathology of Poorly Differentiated and Anaplastic Thyroid Cancer: What Do Pathologists Need to Know?', 'RMRP, RMST, FTX and IPW: novel potential long non-coding RNAs in medullary thyroid cancer.', 'Oncogenic and tumor suppressor function of MEIS and associated factors.']"""

Methods:   Two hundred patients with a total of 318 lesions for which histological correlation was available were analyzed. A novel CNN was designed, trained, and validated using different combinations of distinct MRI sequences as input (e.g., T2-weighted, apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), diffusion-weighted images, and K-trans) and the effect of different sequences on the network's performance was tested and discussed. The particular choice of modeling approach was justified by testing all relevant data combinations. The model was trained and validated using eightfold cross-validation.  Results:   In terms of detection of significant prostate cancer defined by biopsy results as the reference standard, the 3D CNN achieved an area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristics ranging from 0.89 (88.6% and 90.0% for sensitivity and specificity respectively) to 0.91 (81.2% and 90.5% for sensitivity and specificity respectively) with an average AUC of 0.897 for the ADC, DWI, and K-trans input combination. The other combinations scored less in terms of overall performance and average AUC, where the difference in performance was significant with a p value of 0.02 when using T2w and K-trans; and 0.00025 when using T2w, ADC, and DWI. Prostate cancer classification performance is thus comparable to that reported for experienced radiologists using the prostate imaging reporting and data system (PI-RADS). Lesion size and largest diameter had no effect on the network's performance.  Conclusion:   The diagnostic performance of the 3D CNN in detecting clinically significant prostate cancer is characterized by a good AUC and sensitivity and high specificity.  Key points:   • Prostate cancer classification using a deep learning model is feasible and it allows direct processing of MR sequences without prior lesion segmentation. • Prostate cancer classification performance as measured by AUC is comparable to that of an experienced radiologist. • Perfusion MR images (K-trans), followed by DWI and ADC, have the highest effect on the overall performance; whereas T2w images show hardly any improvement.""","""['Nader Aldoj', 'Steffen Lukas', 'Marc Dewey', 'Tobias Penzkofer']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Eur Radiol""","""['Clinically significant prostate cancer detection and segmentation in low-risk patients using a convolutional neural network on multi-parametric MRI.', 'Computer-aided diagnosis of prostate cancer using a deep convolutional neural network from multiparametric MRI.', 'Co-trained convolutional neural networks for automated detection of prostate cancer in multi-parametric MRI.', 'Multiparametric MRI in detection and staging of prostate cancer.', 'Quantitative Prostate MRI.', 'Anatomically guided self-adapting deep neural network for clinically significant prostate cancer detection on bi-parametric MRI: a multi-center study.', 'Three-dimensional convolutional neural network model to identify clinically significant prostate cancer in transrectal ultrasound videos: a prospective, multi-institutional, diagnostic study.', 'Future of prostate imaging: Artificial intelligence in assessing prostatic magnetic resonance imaging.', 'A novel approach for automatic segmentation of prostate and its lesion regions on magnetic resonance imaging.', 'Does deep learning software improve the consistency and performance of radiologists with various levels of experience in assessing bi-parametric prostate MRI?']"""

Here, we describe the appearance of such cancers on multiparametric MRI (mpMRI) and correlate this with histopathology derived from MRI-targeted biopsy.  Materials and methods:   Between May 2011 and January 2019, a total of 4381 consecutive patients underwent 3 T mpMRI. Of these, 53 patients with 58 apical periurethral TZ lesions underwent TRUS/MRI fusion-guided biopsy and 12-core systematic TRUS-guided biopsy. Correlation was made with patient age, PSA, PSA density, whole prostate volume, and Gleason scores.  Results:   A total 53 men (median age 68 years, median PSA 7.94 ng/ml) were identified as having at least one apical periurethral TZ lesion on mpMRI and 5 (9%) patients had more than one apical periurethral lesion. Thus, 58 lesions were identified in 53 patients. Of these 37/53 patients (69%) and 40/58 lesions were positive at biopsy for prostate cancer. Seven were diagnosed by 12-core systematic TRUS-guided biopsy and 34 were diagnosed by TRUS/MRI fusion-guided biopsy. Gleason score was ≥ 3 + 4 in 34/58 (58%) lesions.  Conclusion:   Identification of apical periurethral TZ prostate cancers is important to help guide surgical and radiation therapy as these tumors are adjacent to critical structures. Because of the tendency to undersample the periurethral zone during TRUS biopsy, MRI-guided biopsy is particularly helpful for detecting apical periurethral TZ prostate cancers many of which prove to be clinically significant.""","""['Sena Tuncer', 'Sherif Mehralivand', 'Stephanie A Harmon', 'Thomas Sanford', 'G Thomas Brown', 'Lindsay S Rowe', 'Maria J Merino', 'Bradford J Wood', 'Peter A Pinto', 'Peter L Choyke', 'Baris Turkbey']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Abdom Radiol (NY)""","""['Comparison of Cancer Detection Rates Between TRUS-Guided Biopsy and MRI-Targeted Biopsy According to PSA Level in Biopsy-Naive Patients: A Propensity Score Matching Analysis.', 'Multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and subsequent MRI/ultrasonography fusion-guided biopsy increase the detection of anteriorly located prostate cancers.', 'Prostate Cancer Risk Assessment in Biopsy-naïve Patients: The Rotterdam Prostate Cancer Risk Calculator in Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging-Transrectal Ultrasound (TRUS) Fusion Biopsy and Systematic TRUS Biopsy.', 'Multiparametric MRI in detection and staging of prostate cancer.', 'Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging in the Diagnosis of Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Review.']"""

Still, it is unclear about whether all PI-RADS 4 lesions show the same cancer detection rate (CDR) regardless of tumor size. The aim was to compare the CDRs of small (< 10 mm) and large (≥ 10 mm) PI-RADS 4.  Methods:   After magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed in 684 men, a radiologist interpreted the MR images and detected 281 index lesions categorized as PI-RADS 4 in 281 men. PI-RADS 4 lesions were divided into small and large groups on size of 10 mm. Overall and significant CDRs were compared between the groups. A significant cancer was defined as one with Gleason score (GS) ≥ 7 or tumor volume ≥ 0.5 ml. Tumor volumes were roughly calculated as πr34/3 (π = 3.14 and r = a half of tumor size) and were compared between the groups. Standard reference was a biopsy examination. Fisher's exact and Mann-Whitney tests were used for statistical analysis.  Results:   The overall CDRs of small and large groups were 39.0% (53/136) and 59.3% (86/145), respectively, (p = 0.0008). The median tumor volumes of cancer-proven small and large groups were 0.18 ml (0.01-0.38 ml) and 0.70 ml (0.52-1.44 ml), respectively (p < 0.0001). Using GS or tumor volume, the significant CDRs of these groups were 26.5% (36/136) and 59.3% (86/145), respectively (p < 0.0001), and using GS alone, 26.5% (36/136) and 39.3% (57/145), respectively (p = 0.0232).

Herein, based on the expression profiles from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database, we investigated the interactions between long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) and mRNA by constructing a competing endogenous RNA network. Several competing endogenous RNAs could participate in the tumorigenesis of PCa. Six lncRNA signatures were identified as potential candidates associated with stage progression by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. In addition, 32 signatures from the coexpression network had potential diagnostic value for PCa lymphatic metastasis using machine learning algorithms. By targeting the coexpression network, the antifungal compound econazole was screened out for PCa treatment. Econazole could induce growth restraint, arrest the cell cycle, lead to apoptosis, inhibit migration, invasion, and adhesion in PC3 and DU145 cell lines, and inhibit the growth of prostate xenografts in nude mice.

Elevated Notch activity is associated with high-grade disease and metastasis. To address how Notch affects prostate cancer bone lesions, we manipulated Notch expression in mouse tibia xenografts and monitored tumor growth, lesion phenotype, and the bone microenvironment. Prostate cancer cell lines that induce mixed osteoblastic lesions in bone expressed 5-6 times more Notch3, than tumor cells that produce osteolytic lesions. Expression of active Notch3 (NICD3) in osteolytic tumors reduced osteolytic lesion area and enhanced osteoblastogenesis, while loss of Notch3 in osteoblastic tumors enhanced osteolytic lesion area and decreased osteoblastogensis. This was accompanied by a respective decrease and increase in the number of active osteoclasts and osteoblasts at the tumor-bone interface, without any effect on tumor proliferation. Conditioned medium from NICD3-expressing cells enhanced osteoblast differentiation and proliferation in vitro, while simultaneously inhibiting osteoclastogenesis. MMP-3 was specifically elevated and secreted by NICD3-expressing tumors, and inhibition of MMP-3 rescued the NICD3-induced osteoblastic phenotypes. Clinical osteoblastic bone metastasis samples had higher levels of Notch3 and MMP-3 compared with patient matched visceral metastases or osteolytic metastasis samples. We identified a Notch3-MMP-3 axis in human prostate cancer bone metastases that contributes to osteoblastic lesion formation by blocking osteoclast differentiation, while also contributing to osteoblastogenesis.

Our goal is to quantify outcomes of RARP for patients undergoing RARP by surgeons who regularly or selectively use CSDs.  Methods:   Patients undergoing RARP (4/2014-7/2017) were prospectively entered into the Michigan Urological Surgery Improvement Collaborative (MUSIC) registry. Outcomes included length of stay (LOS) >2 days, >16-day catheterization, 30-day readmission, and clinically significant urine leak or ileus. Retrospective analysis of each adverse event was performed comparing groups using chi-square tests.  Results:   In all, 6746 RARPs were performed by 115 MUSIC surgeons. CSDs were used in 4451 RARP (66.0%), with wide variation in surgeon CSD use (median: 94.7%, range: 0-100%, IQR: 45-100%). The cohorts of patients treated by surgeons with regular vs. selective CSD usage were similar. CSD use pattern was not associated with rates of prolonged catheterization (4.6% vs. 3.9%, p = 0.17) or readmission (4.5% vs. 4.0%, p = 0.35) and multivariable analysis confirmed these findings (each p > 0.10). Regular CSD use was associated with LOS >2 days (8.4% vs. 6.3%, p = 0.001) and multivariable analyses indicated an odds ratio (OR) of 1.42 (95% CI: 1.12-1.79; p = 0.017) and increased likelihood of clinically significant ileus (OR: 1.64; CI: 1.14-2.35; p = 0.008).  Conclusions:   Although there are specific situations in which CSDs are beneficial, e.g. anastomotic leak or observed lymphatic drainage, regular CSD use during RARP was associated with a greater likelihood of LOS >2 days and clinically significant ileus.

Here, we investigated the molecular mechanism underlying the association between the transcriptional coactivator MED1 and AR as a vulnerability in AR-driven CRPC. MED1 undergoes CDK7-dependent phosphorylation at T1457 and physically engages AR at superenhancer sites, and is essential for AR-mediated transcription. In addition, a CDK7-specific inhibitor, THZ1, blunts AR-dependent neoplastic growth by blocking AR/MED1 corecruitment genome-wide, as well as reverses the hyperphosphorylated MED1-associated enzalutamide-resistant phenotype. In vivo, THZ1 induces tumor regression of AR-amplified human CRPC in a xenograft mouse model. Together, we demonstrate that CDK7 inhibition selectively targets MED1-mediated, AR-dependent oncogenic transcriptional amplification, thus representing a potential new approach for the treatment of CRPC. SIGNIFICANCE: Potent inhibition of AR signaling is critical to treat CRPC. This study uncovers a driver role for CDK7 in regulating AR-mediated transcription through phosphorylation of MED1, thus revealing a therapeutically targetable potential vulnerability in AR-addicted CRPC.See related commentary by Russo et al., p. 1490.This article is highlighted in the In This Issue feature, p. 1469.""","""['Reyaz Ur Rasool', 'Ramakrishnan Natesan', 'Qu Deng', 'Shweta Aras', 'Priti Lal', 'Samuel Sander Effron', 'Erick Mitchell-Velasquez', 'Jessica M Posimo', 'Shannon Carskadon', 'Sylvan C Baca', 'Mark M Pomerantz', 'Javed Siddiqui', 'Lauren E Schwartz', 'Daniel J Lee', 'Nallasivam Palanisamy', 'Goutham Narla', 'Robert B Den', 'Matthew L Freedman', 'Donita C Brady', 'Irfan A Asangani']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Cancer Discov""","""['Androgen Receptor Interaction with Mediator Complex Is Enhanced in Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer by CDK7 Phosphorylation of MED1.', 'Androgen Receptor Interaction with Mediator Complex Is Enhanced in Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer by CDK7 Phosphorylation of MED1.', 'MED1 mediates androgen receptor splice variant induced gene expression in the absence of ligand.', 'A natural molecule, urolithin A, downregulates androgen receptor activation and suppresses growth of prostate cancer.', 'Androgen receptor-dependent and -independent mechanisms driving prostate cancer progression: Opportunities for therapeutic targeting from multiple angles.', 'Exploitation of the Androgen Receptor to Overcome Taxane Resistance in Advanced Prostate Cancer.', 'Recent Advances in Cell Membrane Coated-Nanoparticles as Drug Delivery Systems for Tackling Urological Diseases.', 'Dose escalation and expansion cohorts in patients with advanced breast cancer in a Phase I study of the CDK7-inhibitor samuraciclib.', 'Super-enhancer-driven lncRNA LIMD1-AS1 activated by CDK7 promotes glioma progression.', 'Profiling and integrated analysis of transcriptional addiction gene expression and prognostic value in hepatocellular carcinoma.', 'The CDK7 inhibitor CT7001 (Samuraciclib) targets proliferation pathways to inhibit advanced prostate cancer.']"""

Since very high risk CaP has a high rate of occult metastatic disease and early recurrence, we hypothesize that patients with very high risk locally advanced CaP may benefit from docetaxel-based neoadjuvant chemohormonal therapy (NCHT). Thus, we conducted a retrospective study to identify the outcome of these patients treated with NCHT followed by radical prostatectomy (RP).  Patients and methods:   We retrospectively analyzed data from 177 consecutive patients who had very high risk locally advanced CaP between March 2014 and July 2017. Patients received 3 different therapies: (i) 60 men in NCHT group, (ii) 73 men in neoadjuvant hormonal therapy (NHT) group, and (iii) 44 men received immediate RP without neoadjuvant therapy (No-NT group). Surgical outcomes were analyzed and survival differences were compared by the Kaplan-Meier method.  Results:   The NCHT group had statistically significant higher preoperative Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA) (P < 0.002), higher Gleason score (P < 0.002), and more advanced clinical stage (P < 0.001) than other groups. After RP, 81% (42/52) of patients in NCHT group, 73% (51/70) of patients in NHT group, and 48% (21/44) of patients in No-NT group achieved an undetectable PSA (P < 0.001). A total of 14% (6/42) patients achieving a postoperative undetectable PSA experienced biochemical recurrence in the NCHT group, with median biochemical progression-free survival (bPFS) time of 19 months; 47% (24/51) experienced biochemical recurrence in the NHT group, with median bPFS time of 13 months; 81% (17/21) experienced biochemical recurrence in the No-NT group, with median bPFS time of 9 months (P < 0.001). The median follow-up time of 3 groups was 12.5 months in the NCHT group, 18.3 months in the NHT group, and 22.8 months in the No-NT group (P = 0.01).  Conclusion:   Despite having poorer prognostic factors, the NCHT group had better bPFS time after surgery compared to NHT and No-NT groups.

Hence, the appropriate choice of treatment modality or combination of therapeutic approaches can lead to increasing bone pain relief, improving quality of life, etc. This study is aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of combined radiotherapy and hyperthermia for the treatment response of patients with painful bony metastases.  Patients and methods:   In a single-arm clinical trial, 23 eligible patients (14 female and 9 male) with the mean age of 67 years old and suffering from bony metastases were enrolled in the study. Two hours after radiotherapy, the patients underwent hyperthermia for 1 h in the supine position. All the patients completed the brief pain inventory (BPI) assessment tool and quality of life questionnaire (QLQ-C30) from the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) at the baseline, end of the treatment and 1, 2 and 3 months thereafter. The response to the treatment was assessed as the zero score (complete response) or two or more than two-point drop of the worst pain within the preceding 24 h (partial response) during the 3-month posttreatment.  Results:   All the pain intensity and interference scores, except the pain interference with the enjoyment of life score, significantly decreased. A total of 18 out of 23 patients (78%) achieved complete or partial response. The number of patients using pain relief medications decreased from 74% (n=17) at the baseline to 48% (n=11) 3 months later. Moreover, except for nausea and vomiting, appetite loss, diarrhea and financial impact problems, the patients' quality of life improved significantly in all the functional scales and symptoms within 3 months.

Although extracranial metastases are rarely observed, recent studies have shown the presence of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) in the blood of glioma patients, confirming that a subset of tumor cells are capable of entering the circulation. The isolation and characterization of CTCs could provide a non-invasive method for repeated analysis of the mutational and phenotypic state of the tumor during the course of disease. However, the efficient detection of glioma CTCs has proven to be challenging due to the lack of consistently expressed tumor markers and high inter- and intra-tumor heterogeneity. Thus, for this field to progress, an omnipresent but specific marker of glioma CTCs is required. In this article, we demonstrate how the recombinant malaria VAR2CSA protein (rVAR2) can be used for the capture and detection of glioma cell lines that are spiked into blood through binding to a cancer-specific oncofetal chondroitin sulfate (ofCS). When using rVAR2 pull-down from glioma cells, we identified a panel of proteoglycans, known to be essential for glioma progression. Finally, the clinical feasibility of this work is supported by the rVAR2-based isolation and detection of CTCs from glioma patient blood samples, which highlights ofCS as a potential clinical target for CTC isolation.""","""['Sara R Bang-Christensen', 'Rasmus S Pedersen', 'Marina A Pereira', 'Thomas M Clausen', 'Caroline Løppke', 'Nicolai T Sand', 'Theresa D Ahrens', 'Amalie M Jørgensen', 'Yi Chieh Lim', 'Louise Goksøyr', 'Swati Choudhary', 'Tobias Gustavsson', 'Robert Dagil', 'Mads Daugaard', 'Adam F Sander', 'Mathias H Torp', 'Max Søgaard', 'Thor G Theander', 'Olga Østrup', 'Ulrik Lassen', 'Petra Hamerlik', 'Ali Salanti', 'Mette Ø Agerbæk']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Cells""","""['Optimization of rVAR2-Based Isolation of Cancer Cells in Blood for Building a Robust Assay for Clinical Detection of Circulating Tumor Cells.', 'The VAR2CSA malaria protein efficiently retrieves circulating tumor cells in an EpCAM-independent manner.', 'An Oncofetal Glycosaminoglycan Modification Provides Therapeutic Access to Cisplatin-resistant Bladder Cancer.', 'Benchtop technologies for circulating tumor cells separation based on biophysical properties.', 'Technologies for detection of circulating tumor cells: facts and vision.', 'Chondroitin Sulfate Targeting Nanodrug Achieves Near-Infrared Fluorescence-Guided Chemotherapy Against Triple-Negative Breast Primary and Lung Metastatic Cancer.', 'Latest updates on cellular and molecular biomarkers of gliomas.', 'Liquid biopsy-from bench to bedside.', 'Cyclin-dependent kinase subunit2 (CKS2) promotes malignant phenotypes and epithelial-mesenchymal transition-like process in glioma by activating TGFβ/SMAD signaling.', 'Detection of IDH1 Mutations in Plasma Using BEAMing Technology in Patients with Gliomas.']"""

The multivalent versions of small PSMA-targeted molecules are known to be even more efficiently bound to the receptor. Here, we employ a well-known urea-based ligand, 2-[3-(1,3-dicarboxypropyl)-ureido] pentanedioic acid (DUPA) and triazine dendrimers in order to study the effect of molecular size on multivalent targeting in prostate cancer. The synthetic route starts with the preparation of a dichlorotriazine bearing DUPA in 67% overall yield over five steps. This dichlorotriazine reacts with G1, G3, and G5 triazine dendrimers bearing a 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7,10-tetraacetic acid (DOTA) group for 64Cu-labeling at the core to afford poly(monochlorotriazine) intermediates. Addition of 4-aminomethylpiperidine (4-AMP) and the following deprotection produce the target compounds, G1-(DUPA)4, G3-(DUPA)16, and G5-(DUPA)64. These targets include 4/16/64 DUPA groups on the surface and a DOTA group at the core, respectively. In vitro cell assay using PC3-PIP (PSMA positive) and PC3-FLU (PSMA negative) cells reveals that G1-(DUPA)4 has the highest PC3-PIP to PC3-FLU uptake ratio (10-fold) through the PSMA-mediated specific uptake. While G5-(DUPA)64 displayed approximately 12 times higher binding affinity (IC50 23.6 nM) to PC3-PIP cells than G1-(DUPA)4 (IC50 282.3 nM) as evaluated in a competitive binding assay, the G5 dendrimer also showed high non-specific binding to PC3-FLU cells. In vivo uptake of the 64Cu-labeled dendrimers was also evaluated in severe combined inmmunodeficient (SCID) mice bearing PC3-PIP and PC3-FLU xenografts on each shoulder, respectively. Interestingly, quantitative imaging analysis of positron emission tomograph (PET) displayed the lowest tumor uptake in PC3-PIP cells for the midsize dendrimer G3-(DUPA)16 (19.4 kDa) (0.66 ± 0.15%ID/g at 1 h. p.i., 0.64 ± 0.11%ID/g at 4 h. p.i., and 0.67 ± 0.08%ID/g at 24 h. p.i.). Through the specific binding of G1-(DUPA)4 to PSMA, the smallest dendrimer (5.1 kDa) demonstrated the highest PC3-PIP to muscle and PC3-PIP to PC3-FLU uptake ratios (17.7 ± 5.5 and 6.7 ± 3.0 at 4 h p.i., respectively). In addition, the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect appeared to be an overwhelming factor for tumor uptake of the largest dendrimer G5-(DUPA)64 as the uptake was at a similar level irrelevant to the PSMA expression.""","""['Jongdoo Lim', 'Bing Guan', 'Kien Nham', 'Guiyang Hao', 'Xiankai Sun', 'Eric E Simanek']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Biomolecules""","""['Synthesis and biological evaluation of copper-64 radiolabeled DUPA-6-Ahx-(NODAGA)-5-Ava-BBN(7-14)NH2, a novel bivalent targeting vector having affinity for two distinct biomarkers (GRPr/PSMA) of prostate cancer.', 'Evaluation of PSMA-Targeted PAMAM Dendrimer Nanoparticles in a Murine Model of Prostate Cancer.', '(2S)-2-(3-(1-Carboxy-5-(4-211At-Astatobenzamido)Pentyl)Ureido)-Pentanedioic Acid for PSMA-Targeted α-Particle Radiopharmaceutical Therapy.', ""64Cu-1,4,7,10-Tetraazacyclododecane-N,N',N'',N'''-tetraacetic acid-anti-prostate-specific membrane antigen 3/A12 monoclonal antibody."", 'Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen as Target for Neuroimaging of Central Nervous System Tumors.', 'PSMA-Targeted Nanotheranostics for Imaging and Radiotherapy of Prostate Cancer.', 'Dendrimer: An update on recent developments and future opportunities for the brain tumors diagnosis and treatment.', 'A Theranostic Small-Molecule Prodrug Conjugate for Neuroendocrine Prostate Cancer.', 'Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen Targeted Deep Tumor Penetration of Polymer Nanocarriers.', 'Two Decades of Triazine Dendrimers.']"""

The majority of patients (81.3%) indicated at least one specific unmet supportive care need, on average 11 (SD=7.14) unmet supportive care needs. Most frequent supportive care needs are related to fear of cancer progression or recurrence, physical comorbidities and the wish for one member of the professional health care team with whom they can talk to continuously about medical issues across the treatment period.

Due to the lack of long-term data, a close monitoring after FT is essential, but there are still uncertainties about the optimal follow-up regimen. Here we report on a series of FT-HIFU patients with the focus on oncological short-term outcome and the value of postoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).  Methods:   We included 21 patients treated by FT-HIFU using the Focal One® device (EDAP TMS, France) between November 2015 and May 2018. PC localization was assessed by preoperative multiparametric MRI (mpMRI) and transrectal ultrasound-guided targeted and systematic biopsy. Oncological follow-up included prostate-specific antigen (PSA) development, mpMRI, control biopsies (targeted and systematic) of the treated and untreated areas and salvage treatment rate. Control mpMRI and control biopsy were performed after 6-12 months.  Results:   15 patients (71.4%) were managed by focal ablation of a solitary lesion, while 6 patients (28.6%) underwent zonal tumor ablation. All patients underwent control mpMRI and biopsy. After a mean follow-up period of 11.7 months, cancer relapse was detected in 8 patients (38.1%), with 4 patients (19%) having infield recurrence. Postoperative mpMRI revealed 3 out of 4 infield PC relapses but missed 5 out of 7 outfield relapses. Clinically significant cancer recurrence was present in 1 patient (4.8%), which was missed by mpMRI. Posttreatment mpMRI had a sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value of 62.5, 92.3, 83.3 and 80.0%, respectively, for overall relapse detection based on patient level. Only 1 of the 8 recurrences was suspected based on PSA progression. 4 of the 8 patients with PC relapse (19%) underwent salvage therapy (2 patients by radical prostatectomy, 2 patients by salvage FT-HIFU).  Conclusion:   Postoperative mpMRI might play a valuable role during follow-up after focal HIFU therapy, particularly in terms of infield relapse detection.

Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), as a major component of tumor microenvironment, are crucial for tumor progression. This study was aimed to explore the promotion effect of patient-derived CAFs on the proliferation and migration of prostate cancer cells.  Main methods:   CAFs were isolated from tumor tissues of PCa patients. The promotion effect of CAFs on the proliferation and migration of PC-3 and LNCaP cells were evaluated in vitro and in vivo. The concentration of TGF-β1 was measured by Luminex assay. The blocking activity of LY2109761 on the promotion effect of CAFs was also evaluated.  Key findings:   CAFs could significantly promote the proliferation and migration of PC-3 and LNCaP cells both in vitro and in vivo. TGF-β1 was identified as a highly increased factor in CAFs-CM compared with the normal culture medium of these two cancer cell lines.

BRCA2 mutation carriers may have increased risk of uveal melanoma (UM) and cutaneous melanoma (CM), but associations with these cancers in BRCA1 mutation carriers have been mixed. Here, we further assessed whether UM and CM are associated with BRCA1 or BRCA2 by assessing the presence, segregation and reported/predicted pathogenicity of rare germline mutations (variant allele frequency < 0.01) in families with multiple members affected by these cancers. Whole-genome or exome sequencing was performed on 160 CM and/or UM families from Australia, the Netherlands, Denmark and Sweden. Between one and five cases were sequenced from each family, totalling 307 individuals. Sanger sequencing was performed to validate BRCA1 and BRCA2 germline variants and to assess carrier status in other available family members. A nonsense and a frameshift mutation were identified in BRCA1, both resulting in premature truncation of the protein (the first at p.Q516 and the second at codon 91, after the introduction of seven amino acids due to a frameshift deletion). These variants co-segregated with CM in individuals who consented for testing and were present in individuals with pancreatic, prostate and breast cancer in the respective families. In addition, 33 rare missense mutations (variant allele frequency ranging from 0.00782 to 0.000001 in the aggregated ExAC data) were identified in 34 families. Examining the previously reported evidence of functional consequence of these variants revealed all had been classified as either benign or of unknown consequence. Seeking further evidence of an association between BRCA1 variants and melanoma, we examined two whole-genome/exome sequenced collections of sporadic CM patients (total N = 763). We identified one individual with a deleterious BRCA1 variant, however, this allele was lost (with the wild-type allele remaining) in the corresponding CM, indicating that defective BRCA1 was not a driver of tumorigenesis in this instance. Although this is the first time that deleterious BRCA1 mutations have been described in high-density CM families, we conclude that there is an insufficient burden of evidence to state that the increased familial CM or UM susceptibility is because of these variants.

Methods:   Two hundred and eighty-four prostate cancer patients completed the Italian version of the EPIC-26 questionnaire at 45 days (T1) and 3 months (T2) after robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP). Psychometric properties were evaluated using structural equation modeling: the goodness of fit of the correlated five-factor model (CFFM) for the EPIC-26 was assessed using the confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), while longitudinal invariance was conducted to assess the ability of the EPIC-26 to measure QoL construct over time. Test-retest reliability was assessed as well by considering intraclass correlations.  Results:   At T1, the CFFM model displayed a good fit to data. Similarly, the model showed an adequate fit also at T2. Results of the reliability analysis attested the acceptable internal consistency and test-retest reliability of each dimension: all Cronbach's alphas could be classified as acceptable (i.e., above .65) except for low Cronbach's alpha for hormonal dysfunction at T1 (i.e., .638) and urinary irritation at both waves.

Finally, psychometric properties were invariant over time and each of the five dimensions of QoL displayed from moderate (all ICCs above .500) to good test-retest reliability (i.e. ICC for urinary incontinence = .764).  Conclusions:   Results of the CFA and the measurement invariance analysis demonstrated the validity of the Italian version of the EPIC-26 to assess QoL in prostate cancer patients.

Therefore, an alternative method of conducting a cognitive MRI-targeted biopsy that can be successfully performed by the inexperienced clinicians should be developed. Ninety-six males suspected of prostate cancer were analyzed using systematic biopsy and cognitive MRI-targeted biopsy based on our novel three-dimensional matrix positioning method. Typically, the core principle of the latter procedure was to put the MRI and ultrasound images into the same virtual coordinate system. Afterward, the targeted biopsy was transformed to target a coordinate for the suspected lesion in the MRI. Subsequently, patients were assessed for the presence/absence of prostate cancer or high-grade prostate cancer. According to our results, the overall detection rate of prostate cancer was 70.8% (68/96), and the detection rate of high-grade prostate cancer was 56.3% (54/96). Specifically, the detection rate of prostate cancer by systematic biopsy was 54.2% (52/96) and that by targeted biopsy was 59.4% (57/96; P = 0.560). Clearly, the combined application of targeted biopsy could remarkably increase the detection rates of prostate cancer (P = 0.025) and high-grade prostate cancer (P = 0.009).

EMT is characterised by reduced E-cadherin and increased N-cadherin expression (EN-switch), and increased expression of the EMT-regulating transcription factor Forkhead box protein C2 (FOXC2) has been associated with progression and poor prognosis in various malignancies. FOXC2 was recently highlighted as a novel therapy target in prostate cancer, but survival data on FOXC2 are lacking. This study evaluates the expression of FOXC2, E-cadherin and N-cadherin in different prostatic tissues focusing on EMT, clinico-pathological phenotype, recurrence and patient survival. Tissue microarray sections from 338 radical prostatectomies (1986-2007) with long and complete follow-up, 33 castration resistant prostate cancers, 33 non-skeletal metastases, 13 skeletal metastases and 41 prostatic hyperplasias were stained immunohistochemically for FOXC2, E-cadherin and N-cadherin. FOXC2 was strongly expressed in primary carcinomas, including castration resistant tumours and metastatic lesions as compared to benign prostatic hyperplasia. A hybrid epithelial-mesenchymal phenotype, with co-expression of E-cadherin and N-cadherin, was found in the majority of skeletal metastases and in a substantial proportion of castration resistant tumours. In localised carcinomas, the EN-switch was associated with adverse clinico-pathological variables, such as extra-prostatic extension, high pathological stage and lymph node infiltration. In univariate survival analyses of the clinically important, large subgroup of 199 patients with Gleason score 7, high FOXC2 expression and EN-switching were significantly associated with shorter time to clinical recurrence, skeletal metastases and cancer specific death. In multivariate Cox' survival analysis, high FOXC2 and the EN-switch, together with Gleason grade group (GG3 versus GG2), were independent predictors of time to these end-points. High FOXC2 gene expression (mRNA) was also related to patient outcome, validating our immunohistochemical findings. FOXC2 and factors signifying EMT or its intermediate states may prove important as biomarkers for aggressive disease and are potential novel therapy targets in prostate cancer.""","""['Astrid Børretzen', 'Karsten Gravdal', 'Svein A Haukaas', 'Christian Beisland', 'Lars A Akslen', 'Ole J Halvorsen']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""J Pathol Clin Res""","""['The epithelial-mesenchymal transition regulators Twist, Slug, and Snail are associated with aggressive tumour features and poor outcome in prostate cancer patients.', 'Do the expressions of epithelial-mesenchymal transition proteins, periostin, integrin-α4 and fibronectin correlate with clinico-pathological features and prognosis of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer?', 'A switch from E-cadherin to N-cadherin expression indicates epithelial to mesenchymal transition and is of strong and independent importance for the progress of prostate cancer.', 'Epithelial-mesenchymal-transition regulators in prostate cancer: Androgens and beyond.', 'Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition Signaling and Prostate Cancer Stem Cells: Emerging Biomarkers and Opportunities for Precision Therapeutics.', 'FOXC2 as a prognostic marker and a potential molecular target in patients with human solid tumors.', 'The Gene Expression Landscape of Prostate Cancer BM Reveals Close Interaction with the Bone Microenvironment.', 'FOXC2 Promotes Vasculogenic Mimicry in Ovarian Cancer.', 'Pathogenesis of periodontitis - A potential role for epithelial-mesenchymal transition.', 'Circulating Tumour Cells Indicate the Presence of Residual Disease Post-Castration in Prostate Cancer Patient-Derived Xenograft Models.']"""

Various methods have been proposed to address this issue, but they have suffered from either ad hoc assumptions or extreme sensitivity to small differences in model specification. After briefly reviewing past work, we outline a new approach for identifying temporal effects in population-level data. Fundamental to our framework is the recognition that it is only the slopes of an APC model that are unidentified, not the nonlinearities or particular combinations of the linear effects. One can thus use constraints implied by the data along with explicit theoretical claims to bound one or more of the APC effects. Bounds on these parameters may be nearly as informative as point estimates, even with relatively weak assumptions. To demonstrate the usefulness of our approach, we examine temporal effects in prostate cancer incidence and homicide rates.

Then, ZnSO4-induced oxidative damage was evaluated by malondialdehyde (MDA) levels, glutathione (GSH) levels, total oxidant status (TOS) levels, and total antioxidant status (TAS) levels. Apoptotic effects of ZnSO4 were determined by measuring biochemical and immunohistochemical parameters including caspase 3 (CASP3), cytochrome C (CYC), Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax), and B cell CLL/lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) levels. Inflammatory effects of ZnSO4 were investigated by measuring interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) levels. Finally, morphological analysis was performed using hematoxylin-eosin staining. We found that ZnSO4 caused a concentration-dependent increase in oxidative stress, apoptosis, and inflammation pathways.

Differences in overall survival (OS) were calculated using the log-rank testing. A logistic regression model was applied to identify predictors of ER and LR. We further evaluated difference between ER and LR with respect to functional outcomes in urinary and sexual domains as well as the patients QoL.  Results:   Out of 330 patients, 180 patients showed late BCR. Patients rated their global QoL with 64.5% in ER and 68.8% LR as good (EORTC quality of life Questionnaire, question 29 and 30). The questionnaire did not reveal QoL differences in terms of sexual and urinary function within ER and LR. The main predictor for LR was preoperative serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels with a relative risk (RR) of 0.96 (p = 0.011). OS for patients with LR was significant longer than for patients with ER (154.3 vs. 143.2 months, p = 0.018).  Conclusion:   Patients with a BCR show a good quality of life possibly irrespective of the time point of BCR. We further identified preoperative PSA levels as a predictor of LR and noted that patients with LR patients lived longer. Further studies are needed.""","""['Frank Friedersdorff#', 'Laura Buckendahl#', 'Leonie Alt', 'Andreas Maxeiner', 'Stefan Hinz', 'Anna Bichmann', 'Kurt Miller', 'Ahmed Magheli', 'Jonas Busch']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""World J Urol""","""['PSA doubling time as a predictor of clinical progression after biochemical failure following radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer.', 'Preoperative predictive factors and further risk stratification of biochemical recurrence in clinically localized high-risk prostate cancer.', 'Patterns and predictors of early biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy and adjuvant radiation therapy in men with pT3N0 prostate cancer: implications for multimodal therapies.', 'Late biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy is associated with a slower rate of progression.', 'Biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy: what does it mean?', 'Transitioning from conformal radiotherapy to intensity-modulated radiotherapy after radical prostatectomy: Clinical benefit, oncologic outcomes and incidence of gastrointestinal and urinary toxicities.']"""

Methods:   This cohort study is based on the Swedish component of the Nordic Occupational Cancer (NOCCA) project. The cohort includes six million people who participated in one or more of the population censuses in 1960, 1970, 1980 and 1990. The census data were linked to the Swedish Cancer Registry for the 1961-2009 period, extending a previous NOCCA follow-up time by 4 years. We identified 8136 male firefighters. SIRs were calculated using cancer incidence rates in the national population as a reference.  Results:   We found a statistically significant excess of non-melanoma skin cancer (SIR = 1.48, 95% CI 1.20-1.80) but no positive relationship between risk and work duration. There was a small, yet statistically significant increased risk of prostate cancer among firefighters with service times of 30 years or more. The first follow-up period (1961-1975) showed an increased risk of stomach cancer relative to the reference group, while the last period (1991-2009) showed an increased risk of non-melanoma skin cancer. There was no excess risk for all cancer sites combined (SIR = 1.03, 95% CI 0.97-1.09).  Conclusions:   Our results do not support an overall risk of cancer among Swedish firefighters, but a possible risk of non-melanoma skin cancer exists. The previously noted excess of prostate cancer among Swedish firefighters in NOCCA was no longer statistically significant in this extended follow-up but was present among those with the longest service times.""","""['Carolina Bigert', 'Jan Ivar Martinsen', 'Per Gustavsson', 'Pär Sparén']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Int Arch Occup Environ Health""","""['Cancer incidence among firefighters: 45 years of follow-up in five Nordic countries.', 'Cancer incidence in Stockholm firefighters 1958-2012: an updated cohort study.', 'Occupation and cancer - follow-up of 15 million people in five Nordic countries.', 'Cancer Incidence and Mortality among Firefighters: An Overview of Epidemiologic Systematic Reviews.', 'Cancer Incidence and Mortality in Firefighters: A State-of-the-Art Review and Meta-َAnalysis.', 'Firefighting and Cancer: A Meta-analysis of Cohort Studies in the Context of Cancer Hazard Identification.', 'Cancer risk and mortality among firefighters: a meta-analytic review.', 'Cancer and Potential Prevention with Lifestyle among Career Firefighters: A Narrative Review.', 'Comparison of the risks of occupational diseases, avoidable hospitalization, and all-cause deaths between firefighters and non-firefighters: A cohort study using national health insurance claims data.', 'Exposure to wildfire-related PM2.5 and site-specific cancer mortality in Brazil from 2010 to 2016: A retrospective study.']"""

We sought to create and compare the effectiveness of a patient-centered prostate biopsy report compared with standard reports.  Materials and methods:   Using a modified Delphi approach, prostate cancer experts identified critical components of a prostate biopsy report. Patient focus groups provided input for syntax and formatting of patient-centered pathology reports. Ninety-four patients with recent prostate biopsies were block randomized to the standard report with or without the patient-centered report. We evaluated patient activation, self-efficacy, provider communication skills, and prostate cancer knowledge.  Results:   Experts selected primary and secondary Gleason score and the number of positive scores as the most important elements of the report. Patients prioritized a narrative design, non-threatening language and information on risk classification. Initial assessments were completed by 87% (40/46) in the standard report group and 81% (39/48) in the patient-centered report group. There were no differences in patient activation, self-efficacy, or provider communication skills between groups. Patients who received the patient-centered report had significantly improved ability to recall their Gleason score (100% vs. 85%, p = 0.026) and number of positive cores (90% vs. 65%, p = 0.014). In total, 86% of patients who received the patient-centered report felt that it helped them better understand their results and should always be provided.

Photoacoustic imaging (PAI) provides functional and molecular information at ultrasonic resolution based on optical absorption. Combining the strengths of TRUS and PAI approaches, we report the development and bench-to-bedside translation of an integrated TRUS and photoacoustic (TRUSPA) device. TRUSPA uses a miniaturized capacitive micromachined ultrasonic transducer array for simultaneous imaging of anatomical and molecular optical contrasts [intrinsic: hemoglobin; extrinsic: intravenous indocyanine green (ICG)] of the human prostate. Hemoglobin absorption mapped vascularity of the prostate and surroundings, whereas ICG absorption enhanced the intraprostatic photoacoustic contrast.

This study aimed to examine the relationship between body mass index (BMI; 18.5-<25, 25-<30, 30-<35, ≥35 kg/m2) and prognostic risk at diagnosis, compare the concordance between prognostic risk assessed at diagnostic biopsy versus pathologic risk assessed at surgery across BMI categories, and investigate the association between obesity and prostate cancer recurrence and all-cause death.  Methods:   We examined men enrolled in CaPSURE who underwent radical prostatectomy between 1995 and 2017. Multiple imputation methods were used to handle missing data and reported along with complete case findings.  Results:   Participants (n = 5,200) were followed for a median of 4.5 years; 685 experienced recurrence. Obesity was associated with higher prognostic risk at time of diagnosis (ORobese = 1.5; ORvery obese = 1.7) and upward reclassification of disease between biopsy and surgery, driven by change in tumor stage (ORobese = 1.3; ORvery obese = 1.6). We observed an association between BMI and recurrence with adjustment for disease severity using diagnostic factors (HRvery obese = 1.7); this association disappeared when adjusting for disease severity factors obtained at surgery.  Conclusions:   Our findings suggest that residual confounding may partially explain the conflicting evidence regarding obesity's influence on prostate cancer progression. Assessing T-stage via digital rectal exam may be complicated in larger men, potentially affecting clinical treatment decisions. A strong association with all-cause mortality demonstrates healthier BMI at diagnosis may still improve overall survival.  Impact:   Patients with greater BMI are prone to more advanced disease at diagnosis and may be more likely to have their tumor stage underestimated at diagnosis.""","""['Crystal S Langlais', 'Janet E Cowan', 'John Neuhaus', 'Stacey A Kenfield', 'Erin L Van Blarigan', 'Jeanette M Broering', 'Matthew R Cooperberg', 'Peter Carroll', 'June M Chan']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev""","""['Impact of obesity on prostate cancer recurrence after radical prostatectomy: data from CaPSURE.', 'Obesity and oncological outcome after radical prostatectomy: impact of prostate-specific antigen-based prostate cancer screening: results from the Shared Equal Access Regional Cancer Hospital and Duke Prostate Center databases.', 'Obesity, risk of biochemical recurrence, and prostate-specific antigen doubling time after radical prostatectomy: results from the SEARCH database.', 'Body mass index is weakly associated with, and not a helpful predictor of, disease progression in men with clinically localized prostate carcinoma treated with radical prostatectomy.', 'Angiogenesis, p53, bcl-2 and Ki-67 in the progression of prostate cancer after radical prostatectomy.', 'Post-diagnostic health behaviour scores and risk of prostate cancer progression and mortality.', 'Personalized Medicine for Prostate Cancer: Is Targeting Metabolism a Reality?', 'Obesity as a Risk Factor for Prostate Cancer Mortality: A Systematic Review and Dose-Response Meta-Analysis of 280,199 Patients.', 'Post-Diagnostic Dietary and Lifestyle Factors and Prostate Cancer Recurrence, Progression, and Mortality.', 'Dietary Factors and Prostate Cancer Development, Progression, and Reduction.']"""

Simplified business rules based on the American Joint Committee for Cancer (AJCC) Tumour-Node-Metastasis (TNM) stage were applied to obtain Registry-Derived (RD) stage, defined as the best estimate of TNM stage at diagnosis using routine notifications available within cancer registries. RD-stage was compared with Degree of Spread (DoS), which has been recorded for all applicable cancers in NSWCR at a population-based level since 1972, and a summary AJCC-TNM stage group, which has been collected variably since 2006. For each of the five high incidence cancers, we compared the level of improvements RD-staging provided in terms of completeness and accuracy (alignment to more clinically relevant AJCC-TNM) over DoS.  Methods:   For each of the five cancers, stage data were extracted from NSWCR pre- and post- RD-staging to compare data completeness across all three staging systems. The alignment between DoS/RD-stage and AJCC-TNM was compared, as were the expected and observed cross-tabulated frequency distributions using a subset of NSWCR data. To determine differences between use of DoS, RD-stage, and AJCC-TNM in an epidemiological analysis, we compared survival models developed from each of the three stage variables.  Results:   We found RD-staging provided greatest stage data completeness and alignment to AJCC-TNM for prostate cancers, followed by breast, then melanoma and lung cancers. For colorectal cancer, summary stage from DoS was confirmed as an equivalent surrogate staging system to both AJCC-TNM and RD-stage.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical tolerance, effectiveness, patterns of failure, and attempt to define predictive factors based on our experience.  Methods:   The cohort consists of 264 low-risk and 236 intermediate-risk consecutive patients treated at one institution. Prostate-specific antigen (PSA), adverse effects, and androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) usage were noted.  Results:   Median follow-up was 31.3 months. Over 90% of the patients reported no gastrointestinal toxicity. There were 4 occurrences of G3+ sequelae. 75% patients had no genitourinary toxicity at first month, and up to 90% during the rest of follow-up, with only 1 case of G3 adverse event. The toxicity was more pronounced in patients with higher PSA concentrations. Prior to stereotactic ablative radiotherapy, the mean PSA was 7.59 and 277 patients used ADT. The PSA decreased for up to 20 months before reaching a plateau. The decline was slower, and PSA levels were higher in patients without ADT. A total of 15 treatment failures occured in a median time of 19.9 months. Higher PSA concentrations were connected with higher failure rates, even in the first month and prior to reaching Phoenix criterion.  Conclusion:   CyberKnife-based stereotactic ablative radiotherapy of low-risk and intermediate-risk prostate cancer patients is an effective and well-tolerated modality of treatment. PSA is the most important predictive factor.

Moreover, many patients undergo prostate resection without further treatment and are often considered cured. As such, it is expected that many undergo total knee arthroplasty (TKA) for osteoarthritis while having a history of PCa. Nonetheless, limited research is available on this topic, and without it, surgeons may not be aware of increased complication rates. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to evaluate whether patients at a national level with a history of PCa are at increased risk for complications after TKA. A retrospective case-control, comorbidity matched paired analysis was performed. Patients were identified based on International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision codes and matched 1:1 ratio to age, smoker status, chronic kidney disease, diabetes, chronic lung disease, smoking status, and obesity. Patients with active disease were excluded. The 90-day outcomes of TKA were compared through univariate regressions (odds ratios [ORs] and 95% confidence intervals). A total of 2,381,706 TKA patients were identified, and after matching, each comprised 113,365 patients with the same prevalence of the matched comorbidities and demographic characteristics. A significant increase in thromboembolic events that was clinically relevant was found in pulmonary embolisms (PEs) (1.44 vs. 0.4%, OR: 3.04, p < 0.001), Moreover, an increased rate of deep vein thromboses was also seen but was found to be not clinically significant (2.55 vs. 2.85%, OR: 1.19). Although length of stay and other complications were similar, average reimbursements were higher for those with a history of PCa. In conclusion, a history of prior PCa carries significant risk as these patients continue to develop increased PE rates during the 90-day postoperative period which appears to lead to greater economic expenditure.

Developing aptamer probes for PCa cells is of great significance for early diagnosis and treatment of PCa. This paper reports a classification model for SELEX-based aptamers, which were obtained with PCa cell line PCa-3M-1E8 (highly metastatic tumor cell) as target cells and PCa cell line PCa-3M-2B4 (low metastatic tumor cell) as control cells. On the basis of the SELEX principle, 100 oligonucleotide sequences from the 3rd round of SELEX were defined as low affinity and specificity aptamers, and 100 sequences from the 11th round were set as high affinity and specificity aptamers. Seven molecular descriptors were used for the classification model, which were calculated from amino acid sequences translated from DNA aptamer sequences with DNAMAN software. The classification model based on binary logical regression analysis has prediction accuracies, sensitivity, and specificity of about 80% for both the training set and test set. Therefore, it is feasible to calculate molecular descriptors from amino acid sequence translated from DNA aptamer sequences and develop a classification model for PCa cell line PCa-3M-1E8.""","""['Xinliang Yu', 'Huiqiong Yang', 'Xianwei Huang']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""ACS Omega""","""['Prediction of the binding affinity of aptamers against the influenza virus.', 'Pattern recognition of enrichment levels of SELEX-based candidate aptamers for human C-reactive protein.', 'Proteomic analysis of human prostate cancer PC-3M-1E8 cells and PC-3M-2B4 cells of same origin but with different metastatic potential.', 'In silico approaches to RNA aptamer design.', 'SELEX Modifications and Bioanalytical Techniques for Aptamer-Target Binding Characterization.', 'SARS-CoV-2 virus label-free electrochemical nanohybrid MIP-aptasensor based on Ni3(BTC)2 MOF as a high-performance surface substrate.', 'Label-free electrochemical aptasensor for rapid detection of SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein based on the composite of Cu(OH)2 nanorods arrays as a high-performance surface substrate.', 'Prediction of Depuration Rate Constants for Polychlorinated Biphenyl Congeners.']"""

Fully automated localization of peripheral zone (PZ) PCa using the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) map might be clinically useful.  Purpose/hypothesis:   To describe automated localization of PCa in the PZ on ADC map MR images using an ensemble U-Net-based model.  Study type:   Retrospective, case-control.  Population:   In all, 226 patients (154 and 72 patients with and without clinically significant PZ PCa, respectively), training, and testing was performed using dataset images of 146 and 80 patients, respectively.  Field strength:   3T, ADC maps.  Sequence:   ADC map.  Assessment:   The ground truth was established by manual delineation of the prostate and prostate PZ tumors on ADC maps by dedicated radiologists using MRI-radical prostatectomy maps as a reference standard. Statistical Tests: Performance of the ensemble model was evaluated using Dice similarity coefficient (DSC), sensitivity, and specificity metrics on a per-slice basis. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and area under the curve (AUC) were employed as well. The paired t-test was used to test the differences between the performances of constituent networks of the ensemble model.  Results:   Our developed algorithm yielded DSC, sensitivity, and specificity of 86.72% ± 9.93%, 85.76% ± 23.33%, and 76.44% ± 23.70%, respectively (mean ± standard deviation) on 80 test cases consisting of 41 and 39 instances from patients with and without clinically significant tumors including 660 extracted 2D slices. AUC was reported as 0.779.  Data conclusion:   An ensemble U-Net-based approach can accurately detect and segment PCa in the PZ from ADC map MR prostate images.

Methods:   The plasma SII, albumin, and fibrinogen levels were examined before treatment and analyzed with patient clinicopathological parameters and overall survival (OS). The survival analysis was performed using the Kaplan-Meier method, and prognostic factors were assessed using the Cox proportional hazard regression model.  Results:   The incidences of elevated SII level, hypoproteinemia, and hyperfibrinogenemia were 52.51%, 25.14%, and 27.93%, respectively. SII level was associated with neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) (P < 0.001). Albumin level was found closely correlated with ECOG PS (P = 0.006), PLR (P = 0.042), and hemoglobin (P = 0.009), but not other parameters. Elevated plasma fibrinogen level was significantly associated with Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (ECOG PS) (P = 0.009), visceral metastases (P < 0.001), and PLR (P = 0.001). In multivariate Cox regression model, visceral metastases SII (HR 2.133, 95% CI 1.163-3.913; P = 0.014), albumin (HR 0.540, 95% CI 0.307-0.949; P = 0.032), and fibrinogen (HR 1.888, 95% CI 1.069-3.335; P = 0.029) were further confirmed to be the independent prognostic factors for OS. Of the three target parameters, we found that patients with none abnormalities of the three parameters showed the best prognosis, and patients with at least any two abnormalities of them showed markedly worse prognosis than patients with any one abnormalities of the three parameters (P < 0.001).

There has been debate regarding the utility of universal risk calculators to aid in point-of-care prediction of complications in individual patients preoperatively. We retrospectively evaluated the predictive value of the ACS NSQIP universal surgical risk calculator in our patients who underwent RC.  Methods:   A prospective cohort of patients undergoing RC was retrospectively reviewed between October 2014 and August 2017. Only patients who underwent a RC for genitourinary cancer without significant deviation from NSQIP surgery codes 51590, 51595, and 51596 (n = 29) were included. The accuracy of the risk calculator was assessed by ROC AUC and Brier scores for both NSQIP and Clavien-Dindo defined complications. Additionally, each NSQIP risk factor was individually assessed for association with postoperative complications.  Results:   223 patients who underwent open or robotic RC (n = 18) were included for analysis. Determined by AUC C-stat and Brier scores, prediction was good for cardiac complications (0.80 and 0.021), fair for pneumonia (0.75 and 0.017), poor for UTI (0.64 and 0.078), 30-day mortality (0.62 and 0.013), any complication (0.60 and 0.19) and serious complication (0.60 and 0.17). There was a significant discordance between the rate of NSQIP predicted vs. Clavien-Dindo observed any and serious complications: 28.8% vs. 67.3%, and 25.3% vs. 11.7%, respectively.

Methods:   In all, 647 patients diagnosed with NCCN very low/low risk (VL/LR) or F-IR prostate cancer were identified from a multi-institutional PCa biopsy database; all underwent RP with complete postoperative clinicopathological information and Decipher genomic risk scores. The performance of all risk assessment tools was evaluated using logistic regression model for the endpoint of AP, defined as grade group 3-5, pT3b or higher, or lymph node invasion.  Results:   The median age was 61 years (interquartile range 56-66) for 220 patients with NCCN F-IR disease, 53% classified as low-risk by Cancer of the Prostate Risk Assessment (CAPRA 0-2) and 47% as intermediate-risk (CAPRA 3-5). Decipher classified 79%, 13% and 8% of men as low-, intermediate- and high-risk with 13%, 10%, and 41% rate of AP, respectively. Decipher was an independent predictor of AP with an odds ratio of 1.34 per 0.1 unit increased (p value = 0.002) and remained significant when adjusting by CAPRA. Notably, F-IR with Decipher low or intermediate score did not associate with significantly higher odds of AP compared to VL/LR.

We observed that knockdown of DLGAP5 and NUF2 suppresses growth and migration of 22Rv1 cells. Furthermore, immunohistochemical analysis showed that positive expression of DLGAP5 in prostate cancer specimens is related to poor cancer-specific survival rates of patients.

Men from Africa are at increased risk for both aggressive prostate disease and infection. We hypothesize that pathogenic microbes may be contributing, at least in part, to high-risk PCa presentation within Africa and in turn the observed ethnic disparity.  Methods:   Here we reveal through metagenomic analysis of host-derived whole-genome sequencing data, the microbial content within prostate tumor tissue from 22 men. What is unique about this study is that patients were separated by ethnicity, African vs European, and environments, Africa vs Australia.  Results:   We identified 23 common bacterial genera between the African, Australian, and Chinese prostate tumor samples, while nonbacterial microbes were notably absent. While the most abundant genera across all samples included: Escherichia, Propionibacterium, and Pseudomonas, the core prostate tumor microbiota was enriched for Proteobacteria. We observed a significant increase in the richness of the bacterial communities within the African vs Australian samples (t = 4.6-5.5; P = .0004-.001), largely driven by eight predominant genera. Considering core human gut microbiota, African prostate tissue samples appear enriched for Escherichia and Acidovorax, with an abundance of Eubacterium associated with host tumor hypermutation.  Conclusions:   Our study provides suggestive evidence for the presence of a core, bacteria-rich, prostate microbiome. While unable to exclude for fecal contamination, the observed increased bacterial content and richness within the African vs non-African samples, together with elevated tumor mutational burden, suggests the possibility that bacterially-driven oncogenic transformation within the prostate microenvironment may be contributing to aggressive disease presentation in Africa.""","""['Ye Feng', 'Weerachai Jaratlerdsiri', 'Sean M Patrick', 'Ruth J Lyons', 'Anne-Maree Haynes', 'Colin C Collins', 'Phillip D Stricker', 'M S Riana Bornman', 'Vanessa M Hayes']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Whole-Genome Sequencing Reveals Elevated Tumor Mutational Burden and Initiating Driver Mutations in African Men with Treatment-Naïve, High-Risk Prostate Cancer.', 'Metagenomic and metatranscriptomic analysis of human prostate microbiota from patients with prostate cancer.', 'Genome-wide interrogation of structural variation reveals novel African-specific prostate cancer oncogenic drivers.', 'The Microbiome and Prostate Cancer Risk.', 'Bacterial signatures and their inflammatory potentials associated with prostate cancer.', 'The human microbiome links to prostate cancer risk and treatment (Review).', 'Microbiota of Urine, Glans and Prostate Biopsies in Patients with Prostate Cancer Reveals a Dysbiosis in the Genitourinary System.', 'Innate Immune Program in Formation of Tumor-Initiating Cells from Cells-of-Origin of Breast, Prostate, and Ovarian Cancers.', 'Treasures from trash in cancer research.', 'Review of prostate cancer genomic studies in Africa.']"""

This study describes trends in the incidence of solid organ malignancy in Ukraine and the five regions most affected by the radioactive fallout.  Methods:   The National Cancer Registry of Ukraine was queried for age-standardized incidence rates (ASIRs) of solid organ malignancy in Ukraine and the regions of Kyiv, Chernihiv, Zhytomyr, Rivne, and Volyn covering the period of 1999 to 2016. Joinpoint analysis was used to calculate the average annual percentage of change.  Results:   The highest burdens of cancer incidence in Ukraine were seen in the lung, stomach, breast, and prostate. We observed significant increases in the ASIRs of colon (average annual percentage of change, 1.5 [95% CI, 1.3 to 1.7]), rectal (0.9 [95% CI, 0.6 to 1.2]), kidney (2.3 [95% CI, 1.8 to 2.9]), thyroid (4.2 [95% CI, 3.1 to 5.3]), breast (1 [95% CI, 0.6 to 1.4]), cervical (0.7 [95% CI, 0.3 to 1.2]), and prostate (3.9 [95% CI, 3.6 to 4.2]) cancers, with decreases in stomach (-2.4 [95% CI, -2.5 to -2.3]) and lung (-1.8 [95% CI, -2.1 to -1.5]) cancers. ASIRs in the affected regions were similar to nationwide rates, with the exception of those for Kyiv.  Conclusion:   The incidence rates of many solid organ malignancies in Ukraine are rising. However, the rates of solid organ malignancy in the five regions most affected by fallout did not substantially differ from national patterns, with the exception of those for Kyiv. Ongoing monitoring of cancer incidence in Ukraine is necessary to understand how best to decrease disease burden nationwide and to elucidate the causes of regional variations in ASIRs, such as access to diagnostics and environmental exposures.""","""['Krystle M Leung', 'Galyna Shabat', 'Pamela Lu', 'Adam C Fields', 'Andrey Lukashenko', 'Jennifer S Davids', 'Nelya Melnitchouk']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""J Glob Oncol""","""['Breast cancer incidence in the regions of Belarus and Ukraine most contaminated by the Chernobyl accident: 1978 to 2016.', 'THE REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH OF THE FEMALE RESIDENTS IN THE AREAS OF UKRAINE AFFECTED BY THE RADIOACTIVE CONTAMINATION (2007-2017).', 'Breast cancer in Belarus and Ukraine after the Chernobyl accident.', 'The effect of Chernobyl accident on the development of malignant diseases--situation after 20 years.', 'Clinical presentation and clinical outcomes in Chernobyl-related paediatric thyroid cancers: what do we know now?

Methods:   To provide a more precise estimation of the relationship, we performed a meta-analysis of 45 published studies including 329,035 cases and 730,940 controls. We conducted a search in PubMed, Google Scholar and Web of Science to select studies on the association between rs10069690 and cancer risk. Stratification by ethnicity, cancer type, cancers' classification, source of control, sample size, and genotype method was used to explore the source of heterogeneity. The pooled odds ratios (ORs) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were evaluated using random effects models. Sensitivity, publication bias, false-positive report probability (FPRP) and statistical power were also assessed.  Results:   The result demonstrated that rs10069690 was significantly associated with an increased risk of cancer overall (OR = 1.09, 95% CI: 1.06-1.12, p < .001) under the allele model. Stratification analysis revealed an increased cancer risk in subgroups of breast cancer, ovarian cancer, lung cancer, thyroid cancer, and renal cell carcinoma (RCC). However, a significantly decreased association was observed in pancreatic cancer in the European population (OR = 0.93,95% CI: 0.87-0.99, p = .031). In the subgroup analysis based on cancer type, no significant association was found in prostate cancer, leukemia, colorectal cancer and glioma.  Conclusions:   This meta-analysis suggested that the TERT rs10069690 polymorphism may be a risk factor for cancer, especially breast cancer, ovarian cancer, lung cancer, thyroid cancer, and RCC.

Kinesin family member 2A (KIF2A) belongs to the kinesin-13 family and is associated with the growth and invasion of a number of different types of human cancer, including ovarian, breast and prostate cancer. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the expression of KIF2A in NPC and explore the relationship between KIF2A and the basic characteristics of 5-8F cells. Immunohistochemistry was performed on tissues from 97 patients with NPC to assess KIF2A protein expression. KIF2A was knocked down by a specific short interfering (si)RNA in 5-8F cell lines. Cell proliferation, apoptosis and cycle were analyzed by MTT assay and flow cytometry. The invasive ability and angiogenesis were evaluated by Matrigel assay and reverse transcription-quantitative PCR. The level of KIF2A was associated with the growth and migration of primary tumor, nodal status and tumor stage. The viability of KIF2A-knockdown cells was decreased compared with that of the control cells. The number of apoptotic cells, as well as the percentage of cells in the G0/G1 phase, was higher in the KIF2A siRNA group compared with the control group. The invasive and angiogenetic ability of 5-8F cells in the KIF2A siRNA group was decreased compared with the control group. In conclusion, the expression of KIF2A correlated with the poor clinicopathological features in NPC. Therefore, KIF2A may serve an important role in the progression of NPC and proliferation of 5-8F cells, which might present a potential therapeutic target for patients with NPC.""","""['Qiuchan Zhang', 'Dongling Lu', 'Wenlin Liu', 'Shijie Ye', 'Huanping Guo', 'Tianyi Liao', 'Cuifang Chen']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Oncol Lett""","""['Aberrant kinesin family member 2A signifies tumor size and invasion, and may help predict prognosis of patients with papillary thyroid carcinoma.', 'Kinesin family member 2A links with advanced tumor stage, reduced chemosensitivity and worse prognosis in gastric cancer.', 'Downregulation of EB virus miR-BART4 inhibits proliferation and aggressiveness while promoting radiosensitivity of nasopharyngeal carcinoma.', 'High KIF2A expression promotes proliferation, migration and predicts poor prognosis in lung adenocarcinoma.', 'Effects of enhancer of zeste homolog (EZH2) downregulation on the proliferation and invasion of nasopharyngeal carcinoma cell and the possible mechanisms.', 'Expression of KIF2A, NDC80, CDK1, and CCNB1 in breast cancer patients: Their interaction and linkage with tumor features and prognosis.', 'Kinesin Family Member 2A Serves as a Potential Biomarker Reflecting More Frequent Lymph Node Metastasis and Tumor Recurrence Risk in Basal-Like Breast Cancer Patients.', 'Aberrant kinesin family member 2A signifies tumor size and invasion, and may help predict prognosis of patients with papillary thyroid carcinoma.', 'Circular RNA circ_IRAK3 contributes to tumor growth through upregulating KIF2A via adsorbing miR-603 in breast cancer.', 'Non-coding RNAs and glioblastoma: Insight into their roles in metastasis.']"""

We performed a cost-effectiveness model comparing abiraterone plus prednisone (ABI + PRD), cabazitaxel plus prednisone (CAB + PRD) and enzalutamide (ENZ) for visceral metastatic CRPC post-docetaxel therapy resistance. Methods: A three-state (Progression-Free, Progression, Death) lifetime Markov model was constructed to compare ABI + PRD, CAB + PRD, and ENZ from a United States healthcare payer perspective (2019 US$; discount rate 3%/yr.). Effectiveness was measured in life-years (LYs) and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Inputs included treatment costs, grade III/IV adverse events with incidence ≥5%, physician follow-up, lab and imaging tests. Phase III trial Kaplan-Meier curves were extrapolated to estimate overall survival and Progression-Free transition probabilities. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) and utility ratios (ICURs), probabilistic sensitivity analyses (PSAs) and cost-effectiveness acceptability curves at willingness-to-pay (WTP) thresholds were estimated. Results: Models estimated 3-year overall survival rates of 1.3% for patients treated with ABI + PRD, 16.2% for CAB + PRD, and 13.2% for ENZ. Estimated Progression-Free rates at 1.5 years were 0.51% for ABI + PRD, 0.27% for CAB + PRD, and 14.47% for ENZ. LYs and QALYs were 1.20 and 0.58 respectively for ABI + PRD, 1.48 and 0.56 for CAB + PRD, and 1.58 and 0.79 for ENZ. Total treatment costs were: $115,433 for ABI + PRD, $85,337 for CAB + PRD and $109,213 for ENZ. CAB + PRD and ENZ dominated ABI + PRD due to higher LYs gained. Incremental QALYs for ENZ vs. CAB + PRD were larger than incremental LYs. The ICUR for ENZ was $103,674/QALY compared to CAB + PRD. Conclusions: This analysis found ENZ provided greater LYs and QALYs than both ABI + PRD and CAB + PRD, at a lower cost than ABI + PRD, but at a higher cost compared to CAB + PRD.

In this study, we investigated the potential prognostic utility of KIF18A and its role in prostate cancer progression. MATERIAL AND METHODS We collected prostate cancer and paracancerous tissue samples from the same patient. Immunohistochemical staining was performed to investigate the KIF18A expression levels in the clinical sample. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database was analyzed via a bioinformatics approach to gain insight into the relationship between KIF18A expression and prognosis. We examined the effect of KIF18A knockdown on PC-3 cell proliferation via colony formation and MTT assays. Flow cytometry was used to assess the effect of KIF18A knockdown on PC-3 cell apoptosis. Transwell invasion assay was performed to assess whether KIF18A affects the invasion ability of PC-3 cells. RESULTS The KIF18A protein level was higher in PCa tissue than in paracancerous tissue. The In addition, upregulated KIF18A suggested a poor tumor stage and prognosis for prostate cancer patients. Our in vitro experiments demonstrated that KIF18A knockdown in PC-3 cells significantly inhibited proliferation and metastasis.

Identifying men with at a low risk of disease reclassification may help reduce the number of biopsies.  Objective:   To assess the external validity of two Canary Prostate Active Surveillance Study Risk Calculators (PASS-RCs), which estimate the probability of reclassification (Gleason grade ≥7 with or without >34% of biopsy cores positive for PCa) on a surveillance biopsy, using a mix of months since last biopsy, age, body mass index, prostate-specific antigen, prostate volume, number of prior negative biopsies, and percentage (or ratio) of positive cores on last biopsy.  Design, setting, and participants:   We used data up to November 2017 from the Movember Foundation's Global Action Plan (GAP3) consortium, a global collaboration between AS studies.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   External validity of the PASS-RCs for estimating reclassification on biopsy was assessed by calibration, discrimination, and decision curve analyses.  Results and limitations:   Five validation cohorts (Prostate Cancer Research International: Active Surveillance, Johns Hopkins, Toronto, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, and University of California San Francisco), comprising 5105 men on AS, were eligible for analysis. The individual cohorts comprised 429-2416 men, with a median follow-up between 36 and 84 mo, in both community and academic practices mainly from western countries. Abilities of the PASS-RCs to discriminate between men with and without reclassification on biopsy were reasonably good (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve values 0.68 and 0.65). The PASS-RCs were moderately well calibrated, and had a greater net benefit than most default strategies between a predicted 10% and 30% risk of reclassification.  Conclusions:   Both PASS-RCs improved the balance between detecting reclassification and performing surveillance biopsies by reducing unnecessary biopsies. Recalibration to the local setting will increase their clinical usefulness and is therefore required before implementation.  Patient summary:   Unnecessary prostate biopsies while on active surveillance (AS) should be avoided as much as possible.

Moreover, absence of appropriate biomarker is one of the major challenges for prostate specific membrane antigen negative (PSMA (-)) prostate cancer therapy.  Results:   Herein, a PSMA (-) prostate cancer specific targeted and intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) amplification for ROS-responsive self-accelerating drug release nanoplatform (ATD-NPs) was developed. ATD-NPs was formed by three parts, including PSMA (-) prostate cancer specifically targeted part (DUP-PEG-DSPE), ROS-sensitive doxorubicin (DOX) polymeric prodrug (P(L-TK-DOX)), and the ROS generation agent (α-tocopheryl succinate, α-TOS); and this delivery system is expected to enhance PSMA (-) prostate cancer therapeutic effect, increase selective accumulation at tumor site and overcome intracellular incomplete drug release. After administration i.v injection, ATD-NPs could specifically accumulate in tumor site and markedly be internalized by cancer cells based on the DUP-1 (a PSMA (-) cancer cells specific target peptide). Subsequently, ATD-NPs could be dissociated under the high concentration reactive oxygen species (ROS) condition, resulting in DOX and α-TOS release. Then, the released α-TOS could be reacted with mitochondria to produce ROS, which in turn accelerating the release of drugs. Finally achieved the purpose of enhancing therapeutic efficacy and reducing side effect. Both in vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrated that the combination of tumor actively-targeted and self-amplifying ROS-responsive drug release showed more significant antitumor activity in the human PSMA (-) prostate cancer.  Conclusion:   The described technology unifies the tumor actively targets, self-amplified drug release, and excellent biocompatibility into one formulation, are promising for cancer treatment.""","""['Yifan Wang', 'Yanqiu Zhang', 'Zhengxing Ru', 'Wei Song', 'Lin Chen', 'Hao Ma', 'Lizhu Sun']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""J Nanobiotechnology""","""['A pH-Responsive Charge-Reversal Drug Delivery System with Tumor-Specific Drug Release and ROS Generation for Cancer Therapy.', 'PEG-PLA nanoparticles decorated with small-molecule PSMA ligand for targeted delivery of galbanic acid and docetaxel to prostate cancer cells.', 'Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen Targeted Therapy of Prostate Cancer Using a DUPA-Paclitaxel Conjugate.', 'Efficacy Against Human Prostate Cancer by Prostate-specific Membrane Antigen-specific, Transforming Growth Factor-β Insensitive Genetically Targeted CD8+ T-cells Derived from Patients with Metastatic Castrate-resistant Disease.', 'Targeted prodrug approaches for hormone refractory prostate cancer.', 'Responsive Microneedles as a New Platform for Precision Immunotherapy.', 'SOX15 transcriptionally increases the function of AOC1 to modulate ferroptosis and progression in prostate cancer.', 'Protease-triggered bioresponsive drug delivery for the targeted theranostics of malignancy.', 'Helenalin Facilitates Reactive Oxygen Species-Mediated Apoptosis and Cell Cycle Arrest by Targeting Thioredoxin Reductase-1 in Human Prostate Cancer Cells.', 'Oxidative Stress in the Tumor Microenvironment and Its Relevance to Cancer Immunotherapy.']"""

Unconditional multiple logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) regarding probability. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to assess the efficacy of the predictive variables. Castration resistance free survival curves were obtained using the Kaplan-Meier method, and were compared using the log-rank test.  Results:   Being overweight was associated with an increased risk of positive margins (OR 2.281; 95% CI 1.292-4.028) after adjusting for potential confounders. The area under the ROC curve for overweight patients was larger than that for patients in the normal weight range.

Preoperative evaluation of patients with lower urinary tract symptoms may help to identify at-risk patients and the International Prostate Symptoms Score (IPSS) has been used as a screening tool to quantify the severity of symptoms in males. A prospective cohort of 303 patients undergoing total hip or knee arthroplasty was evaluated using the IPSS. Patients were categorized into three symptom groups (mild, moderate and severe based on scores of 0-7, 8-18 and greater than 18, respectively) and four age groups (<50 years, 51-60 years, 61-70 years and greater than 70 years). Twenty-six patients (8.6%) developed urinary retention and were catheterized postoperatively; of these, 16 were male and 10 were female. Statistical analysis using logistic regression models showed significant association between severe IPSS scores (>18) and urinary retention requiring catheterization in both males and females with both high specificity and sensitivity in the test in predicting postoperative catheterization. Hence, this test is a valid preoperative screen in predicting postoperative catheterization.""","""['Alasdair Ja Santini', 'Chetan A Jakaraddi', 'Fotis Polydoros', 'Sree Metikala']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""J Orthop Surg (Hong Kong)""","""['Incidence and Risk Factors of Postoperative Urinary Retention and Bladder Catheterization in Patients Undergoing Fast-Track Total Joint Arthroplasty: A Prospective Observational Study on 371 Patients.', 'Predicting postoperative urinary retention after lower limb arthroplasty.', 'Mitigation of postoperative urinary retention among total joint replacement patients using the ERAS protocol and applying risk-stratified catheterization.', 'Urinary retention following lower limb arthroplasty: analysis of predictive factors and review of literature.', 'Urinary retention after total hip and knee arthroplasty.', 'Prophylactic doxazosin reduces urinary retention and promotes recovery after total joint arthroplasty: A randomized controlled trial.']"""
