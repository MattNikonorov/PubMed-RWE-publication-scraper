In this study, we tested the inhibitory effects of wogonoside in human prostate cancer PC3 cells in vitro and vivo.  Methods:   The effects of wogonoside on cell viability, cycle progression, invasion, migration, and apoptosis were assessed in vitro. The levels of proteins in related signaling pathways were detected by western blotting assay. Finally, nude mouse tumorigenicity assay was conducted to detect the anticancer effect of wogonoside in vivo.  Results:   Wogonoside inhibited cell viability, invasive and migratory ability in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Flow cytometry indicated that wogonoside could induce cell apoptosis and S phase cell-cycle arrest. Mechanically, wogonoside suppressed the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, and the level of p-glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β; Ser9) was inhibited by wogonoside. The epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process was also reversed in PC3 cell line after wogonoside treatment. In vivo experiments showed that wogonoside inhibited tumor growth in xenograft mouse models.  Conclusion:   These findings revealed that wogonoside could suppress Wnt/β-catenin pathway and reversing the EMT process in PC3 cells. GSK-3β acts as a tumor suppressor in prostate cancer. Wogonoside may serve as an effective agent for treating prostate cancer.""","""['Can Wei', 'Junfeng Jing', 'Yanbin Zhang', 'Ling Fang']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Pharmacology""","""['Baicalein suppresses metastasis of breast cancer cells by inhibiting EMT via downregulation of SATB1 and Wnt/β-catenin pathway.', 'Jatrorrhizine inhibits colorectal carcinoma proliferation and metastasis through Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway and epithelial-mesenchymal transition.', 'Wogonoside inhibits angiogenesis in breast cancer via suppressing Wnt/β-catenin pathway.', 'Wnt/β-catenin signalling in prostate cancer.', 'Exploring the Wnt Pathway as a Therapeutic Target for Prostate Cancer.', 'Wogonoside inhibits TNF receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6) mediated-tumor microenvironment and prognosis of pancreatic cancer.', 'Wogonoside Attenuates Cutaneous Squamous Cell Carcinoma by Reducing Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition/Invasion and Cancer Stem-Like Cell Property.', 'Effects of wogonoside on invasion and migration of lung cancer A549 cells and angiogenesis in xenograft tumors of nude mice.']"""

In order to find a new drug for prostate cancer, a series of novel conformationally constrained analogues of (+)-goniofufurone and 7-epi-(+)-goniofufurone, as well as the newly synthesized styryl lactones containing the cinnamic acid ester groups were evaluated for in vitro cytotoxicity against prostate cancer cell (PC-3). Furthermore, prediction of physicochemical characteristics and drugability as well as in silico ADME-Tox tests of investigated compounds were performed. The 3D-QSAR model was established using the comparative molecular field analysis method. According to obtained results, the tricyclic compounds 9 and 10 had the highest potency with IC50 < 20 μM. Evaluation of structural features through 3D-QSAR model identified steric field feature on the cinnamic acid ester groups at C-7 as a crucial for the cytotoxic activity. This research suggests that most of the analysed compounds have desirable properties for drug candidates and high potential in drug development, which recommend them for further research in treatment of prostate cancer.

Materials and methods:   Patients undergoing MRI-TB + SB for suspicious MRI lesions were retrospectively reviewed. These patients had a previous prostate biopsy and were evaluated with MRI to assess the need for a repeat biopsy. Pathologic findings of MRI-TB combined with a SB were compared to those of the patients' previous SB. An upgrade was defined as an increase in the Gleason Score of any prior biopsy. A no-upgrade (NU) MRI-TB was defined as a MRI-TB that did not lead to disease upgrading when compared to SB.  Results:   A total of 148 patients were analyzed in this study. Of the 255 total lesions (247 lesions with PI-RADS ≥3), 141 were upgraded from the previous biopsy (55.3%). Of these, 104 were upgraded by the MRI-TB (40.8%), and 87 lesions were upgraded by the SB (34.1%). The MRI-TB had a NU rate of 26.2% for all lesions. On subanalysis, the NU rates of PI-RADS 3, 4, and 5 MRI-TBs were 39.3%, 21.2%, and 3.4%, respectively.  Conclusion:   The NU rate for the MRI-TB in a PIRADS-5 lesion is meager. Men with a PI-RADS 5 lesion may be safely managed with the MRI-TB alone without combining with SB.

Subjects/patients and methods:   We identified men with a baseline negative prostate biopsy from REDUCE who did not undergo prostate surgery or develop prostate cancer over the trial period. Men reported statin use at baseline. PV was determined from transrectal ultrasonography performed to guide prostate biopsy at baseline, and 2- and 4-years after randomisation. Multivariable generalised estimating equations tested differences in PV change over time by statin use, overall and stratified by treatment arm. We tested for interactions between statins and time in association with PV using the Wald test.  Results:   Of 4106 men, 17% used statins at baseline. Baseline PV did not differ by statin use. Relative to non-users, statin users had decreasing PVs over the trial period (P = 0.027). Similar patterns were seen in the dutasteride and placebo arms, although neither reached statistical significance. The mean estimated PV was modestly but significantly lower in statin users relative to non-users in the dutasteride arm at 2-years (4.5%, P = 0.032) and 4-years (4.0%, P = 0.033), with similar (3-3.3%) but non-significant effects in the placebo arm.  Conclusion:   If confirmed, our present findings support a role for statins in modestly attenuating PV growth, with a magnitude of effect in line with previously reported prostate-specific antigen-lowering effects of statins (~4%). Future studies are needed to assess whether this putative role for statins in PV growth could impact lower urinary tract symptom development or progression.""","""['Emma H Allott', 'Ilona Csizmadi', 'Lauren E Howard', 'Roberto L Muller', 'Daniel M Moreira', 'Gerald L Andriole', 'Claus G Roehrborn', 'Stephen J Freedland']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""BJU Int""","""['Statin Use and Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms Incidence and Progression in Reduction by Dutasteride of Prostate Cancer Events (REDUCE) Trial.', 'Obesity is associated with increased prostate growth and attenuated prostate volume reduction by dutasteride.', 'Statin use and risk of prostate cancer and high-grade prostate cancer: results from the REDUCE study.', 'Chemoprevention using dutasteride: the REDUCE trial.', '5-α-Reductase inhibitors for prostate cancer chemoprevention: an updated Cochrane systematic review.', 'Beyond Lipid-Lowering: Effects of Statins on Cardiovascular and Cerebrovascular Diseases and Cancer.', 'The effect of pharmacotherapy on prostate volume, prostate perfusion and prostate-specific antigen (prostate morphometric parameters) in patients with lower urinary tract symptoms and benign prostatic obstruction.

R-roscovitine is a cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor that induces apoptosis in colorectal, breast, prostate, multiple myeloma, other cancer cell lines, and tumor xenografts, in micromolar concentrations. It is well tolerated in phase II clinical trials. R-roscovitine inhibits open hERG channels but does not become trapped in the pore. Two-electrode voltage clamp recordings from Xenopus oocytes expressing wild-type (WT) or hERG pore mutant channels (T623A, S624A, Y652A, F656A) demonstrated that compared to WT hERG, T623A, Y652A, and F656A inhibition by 200 μM R-roscovitine was ~ 48%, 29%, and 73% weaker, respectively. In contrast, S624A hERG was inhibited more potently than WT hERG, with a ~ 34% stronger inhibition. These findings were further supported by the IC50 values, which were increased for T623A, Y652A and F656A (by ~5.5, 2.75, and 42 fold respectively) and reduced 1.3 fold for the S624A mutant. Our data suggest that while T623, Y652, and F656 are critical for R-roscovitine-mediated inhibition, S624 may not be. Docking studies further support our findings. Thus, R-roscovitine's relatively unique features, coupled with its tolerance in clinical trials, could guide future drug screens.""","""['Bryan Cernuda', 'Christopher Thomas Fernandes', 'Salma Mohamed Allam', 'Matthew Orzillo', 'Gabrielle Suppa', 'Zuleen Chia Chang', 'Demosthenes Athanasopoulos', 'Zafir Buraei']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Ranolazine inhibition of hERG potassium channels: drug-pore interactions and reduced potency against inactivation mutants.', 'Blockade of the human ether-a-go-go-related gene potassium channel by ketamine.', 'Combined receptor and ligand-based approach to the universal pharmacophore model development for studies of drug blockade to the hERG1 pore domain.', 'The cardiac hERG/IKr potassium channel as pharmacological target: structure, function, regulation, and clinical applications.', 'HERG K+ channel, the target of anti-arrhythmias drugs.', 'Nifedipine Ameliorates Cellular Differentiation Defects of Smn-Deficient Motor Neurons and Enhances Neuromuscular Transmission in SMA Mice.', 'Targeting late ICaL to close the window to ventricular arrhythmias.', 'Suppression of ventricular arrhythmias by targeting late L-type Ca2+ current.', 'Structure-Based Prediction of hERG-Related Cardiotoxicity: A Benchmark Study.', 'In silico Exploration of Interactions Between Potential COVID-19 Antiviral Treatments and the Pore of the hERG Potassium Channel-A Drug Antitarget.']"""

We compared the causes, costs and predictors of index vs nonindex hospital readmissions after radical prostatectomy.  Materials and methods:   We identified patients with prostate cancer who underwent radical prostatectomy from 2010 to 2014 in the Nationwide Readmissions Database. Sociodemographic factors, hospital costs and causes of 90-day readmissions were compared between index and nonindex hospital readmissions. Multivariable regression models were used to determine whether nonindex readmissions were more costly than index readmission for several causes of readmission and also to identify predictors of nonindex readmissions.  Results:   Of the 214,473 patients treated with radical prostatectomy 12,316 (5.7%) experienced a 90-day readmission and 4,283 (30.6%) had a nonindex readmission. Nonindex readmissions were more likely for complications which were cardiovascular specific (16.6% vs 10.3%) and nonradical prostatectomy specific (49.4% vs 32.8%, each p <0.01). On multivariable modeling readmission costs were significantly higher for nonindex vs index readmissions ($10,751 vs $10,113, p <0.01). Cardiovascular and electrolyte related nonindex readmissions ($12,995 vs $10,108, p <0.001, and $4,962 vs $3,179, p=0.01, respectively) were more expensive.

Conclusions:   In this nationally representative study nonindex hospital readmissions were associated with higher readmission costs, which were driven by differences in a small subset of readmissions.

Age, prostate volume, prostate specific antigen and prostate specific antigen density were assessed as predictors of positive multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging, defined as PI-RADS™ (Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System) version 2/Likert score 4 or greater. The cohort was split into a training cohort of 605 patients and a validation cohort of 260. The optimal threshold to rule out positive multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging was chosen to achieve a negative predictive value greater than 90%.  Results:   All clinical variables were significant predictors of positive multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (p <0.05). Prostate specific antigen density outperformed other parameters in diagnostic accuracy and did not significantly differ compared to a multivariate model (AUC=0.74 vs 0.75). At prostate specific antigen density greater than 0.078 ng/ml2 sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values were 94%, 29%, 22% and 95%, respectively, resulting in 25% fewer scans (64 of 260).

Prostate cancer progression is driven by androgen steroid hormones, and delayed by androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). Androgens control transcription by stimulating androgen receptor (AR) activity, yet also control pre-mRNA splicing through less clear mechanisms. Here we find androgens regulate splicing through AR-mediated transcriptional control of the epithelial-specific splicing regulator ESRP2. Both ESRP2 and its close paralog ESRP1 are highly expressed in primary prostate cancer.

Objective:   To assess the impact of time from diagnosis to RP on post-operative erectile function (EF) outcomes.  Materials and methods:   We analyzed data for 827 patients treated with RP at a single center from 2002 to 2017. The International Index of Erectile Function-EF (IIEF-EF) was compiled by every patient (EF recovery equal to IIEF-EF ≥ 22). Time from diagnosis to treatment was defined as the interval between biopsy and RP. Cox regression analysis was used to test the impact of time to surgery on the probability of EF recovery. Kaplan-Meier analysis compared the cumulative incidence of EF recovery according to time from diagnosis to surgery. The impact of time to RP on EF was tested also in a sub-cohort of patients eligible for active surveillance (AS).  Results:   Overall, low-, intermediate-, and high-risk PCa was found in 306 (37%), 422 (51%), and 99 (12%) patients. Of them, 148 (17.9%) would have been eligible for AS. A total of 152 (18%) and 22 (2.7%) patients were treated after 6 and 12 months from diagnosis. The overall probability of EF recovery was 32% (95% CI: 29-36) at 24 months. Cox regression analysis showed that time from biopsy to surgery was not associated with a different chance of EF recovery (HR: 1.01; 95% CI: 0.97-1.05; p = 0.7). At Kaplan-Meier analysis, the cumulative incidence of EF recovery did not differ between patients treated within 6 months, from 6 to 12 months and after 12 months from diagnosis. Similar findings were obtained for patients eligible for AS.

Methods:   In proton DS delivery, the spread-out Bragg peak (SOBP) is created almost instantaneously by the constant rotation of the range modulator. US, however, delivers each entire energy layer of the SOBP sequentially from distal to proximal direction in time, which can interplay with prostate intrafraction motion. This spatiotemporal interplay during proton treatment was simulated to evaluate its dosimetric impact. Prostate clinical target volume (CTV) dose was obtained by moving CTV through dose matrices of the energy layers according to prostate-motion traces. Fourteen prostate intrafraction motion traces of each of 17 prostate patients were used in the simulated treatment deliveries. Both single fraction dose-volume histograms (DVHs) and fraction-cumulative DVHs were obtained for both 2 Gy per fraction and 7.25 Gy per fraction stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT).  Results:   The simulation results indicated that CTV dose degradation depends on the magnitude and direction of prostate intrafraction motion and is patient specific. For some individual fractions, prescription dose coverage decreased in both US and DS treatments, and hot and cold spots inside the CTV were observed in the US results. However, fraction-cumulative CTV dose coverage showed much reduced dose degradation for both DS and US treatments for both 2 Gy per fraction and SBRT simulations.  Conclusions:   This study indicated that CTV dose inhomogeneity may exist for some patients with severe prostate intrafraction motion during US treatments. However, there are no statistically significant dose differences between DS and US treatment simulations.

It has been reported to successfully detect primary and recurrent PC. Here, we describe the distribution and range of physiological uptake of 68Ga-RM2 in 95 patients with biochemically recurrent (BCR) PC.  Materials and methods:   Ninety-five participants had simultaneous PET/MRI for BCR PC and were prospectively enrolled in this study. Maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) and mean standardized uptake value (SUVmean) were measured in 24 normal anatomical structures for each participant. Three readers evaluated the images independently. Uptake in various normal tissues was classified into 4 different categories: no significant uptake if SUVmean was less than SUVmean of the aortic arch (AA); mild if SUVmean was less or equal to 2.5, but higher than SUVmean of the AA; moderate if SUVmean was higher than 2.5, but less or equal to 5; intense if SUVmean was higher than 5.  Results:   The most intense uptake was observed in the urinary bladder, due to excretion of the radiotracer. No significant uptake was seen in the brain, salivary glands, lungs, myocardium, skeleton, muscles, and fat. Liver, spleen, and adrenal glands had mostly no significant uptake; the gastrointestinal tract had intense physiological uptake, with pancreas being the organ with the highest SUVmax measurements (average SUVmax 64.91). Mild and moderate uptake was measured in the esophagus (average SUVmax 3.99), while the stomach wall, duodenum, and rectum had mild uptake (average SUVmax 2.49, 3.42, and 3.58, respectively).  Conclusions: 68Ga-RM2 has been mostly evaluated for PC detection, but it can be used for other tumors overexpressing GRPR such as breast cancer. This atlas of normal biodistribution and SUV measurements in healthy tissues will help physicians distinguish between physiological vs. pathological uptake, as well as potentially assist with planning future studies using GRPR targeting radiopharmaceuticals.""","""['Lucia Baratto', 'Heying Duan', 'Riccardo Laudicella', 'Akira Toriihara', 'Negin Hatami', 'Valentina Ferri', 'Andrei Iagaru']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Eur J Nucl Med Mol Imaging""","""['Pilot Comparison of ⁶⁸Ga-RM2 PET and ⁶⁸Ga-PSMA-11 PET in Patients with Biochemically Recurrent Prostate Cancer.', 'Prospective Evaluation of 68Ga-RM2 PET/MRI in Patients with Biochemical Recurrence of Prostate Cancer and Negative Findings on Conventional Imaging.', 'More advantages in detecting bone and soft tissue metastases from prostate cancer using 18F-PSMA PET/CT.', 'PET Imaging Using Gallium-68 (68Ga) RM2.', 'Imaging of Prostate Cancer Using Gallium-68-Labeled Bombesin.', 'Modified PROMISE criteria for standardized interpretation of gastrin-releasing peptide receptor (GRPR)-targeted PET.', 'Preliminary Findings of the Role of FAPi in Prostate Cancer Theranostics.', 'Prostate Cancer Biochemical Recurrence Resulted Negative on 68GaGa-PSMA-11 but Positive on 18FFluoromethylcholine PET/CT.', 'Radiomics and artificial intelligence in prostate cancer: new tools for molecular hybrid imaging and theragnostics.', 'Non-conventional and Investigational PET Radiotracers for Breast Cancer: A Systematic Review.']"""

Therefore, we developed a single-cell assay for quantifying centrosomes in human prostate tissue. Surprisingly, centrosome loss-which has not been described in human cancer-was associated with PCa progression. By chemically or genetically inducing centrosome loss in nontumorigenic prostate epithelial cells, mitotic errors ensued, producing aneuploid, and multinucleated cells. Strikingly, transient or chronic centrosome loss transformed prostate epithelial cells, which produced highly proliferative and poorly differentiated malignant tumors in mice.

This is in part through the activation of the androgen receptor (AR) signaling. However, the molecular underpinning of ROS to activate AR remains poorly understood. Here, we report that the thioredoxin domain-containing 9 (TXNDC9) is an important regulator of ROS to trigger AR signaling. TXNDC9 expression is upregulated by ROS inducer, and increased TXNDC9 expression in patient tumors is associated with advanced clinical stages. TXNDC9 promotes PCa cell survival and proliferation. It is required for AR protein expression and AR transcriptional activity under oxidative stress conditions. Mechanistically, ROS inducers promote TXNDC9 to dissociate from PRDX1, but enhance a protein association with MDM2. Concurrently, PRDX1 enhances its association with AR. These protein interaction exchanges result in not only MDM2 protein degradation, but also PRDX1 mediated AR protein stabilization, and subsequent elevation of AR signaling. Blocking PRDX1 by its inhibitor, Conoidin A (CoA), suppresses AR signaling, PCa cell proliferation, and xenograft tumor growth even under androgen-deprived conditions. These tumor-suppressive effects of CoA were further strengthened when in combination with enzalutamide treatment. Together, these studies demonstrate that the TXNDC9-PRDX1 axis plays an important role for ROS to activate AR functions. It provides a proof-of-principle that co-targeting AR and PRDX1 may be more effective to control PCa growth.""","""['Tingting Feng', 'Ru Zhao', 'Feifei Sun', 'Qiqi Lu', 'Xueli Wang', 'Jing Hu', 'Shiguan Wang', 'Lin Gao', 'Qianqian Zhou', 'Xueting Xiong', 'Xuesen Dong', 'Lin Wang#', 'Bo Han#']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Oncogene""","""['Cotargeting Androgen Receptor and Clusterin Delays Castrate-Resistant Prostate Cancer Progression by Inhibiting Adaptive Stress Response and AR Stability.', 'Targeted suppression of AR-V7 using PIP5K1α inhibitor overcomes enzalutamide resistance in prostate cancer cells.', 'p66Shc protein through a redox mechanism enhances the progression of prostate cancer cells towards castration-resistance.', 'Understanding the mechanisms of androgen deprivation resistance in prostate cancer at the molecular level.', 'Strategies for targeting the androgen receptor axis in prostate cancer.', 'Cancer Metabolism: The Role of ROS in DNA Damage and Induction of Apoptosis in Cancer Cells.', 'Thioredoxin domain-containing protein 9 protects cells against UV-B-provoked apoptosis via NF-κB/p65 activation in cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma.', 'The Role of Peroxiredoxins in Cancer Development.', 'Phosducin-like 3 is a novel prognostic and onco-immunological biomarker in glioma: A multi-omics analysis with experimental verification.', 'Oxidative stress and redox signaling in CRPC progression: therapeutic potential of clinically-tested Nrf2-activators.']"""

Randomised trials evaluating aspirin use after primary radical therapy are ongoing. We present the pre-planned feasibility analysis of the run-in phase of the Add-Aspirin trial to address concerns about toxicity, particularly bleeding after radical treatment for gastro-oesophageal cancer.  Methods:   The Add-Aspirin protocol includes four phase 3 randomised controlled trials evaluating the effect of daily aspirin on recurrence and survival after radical cancer therapy in four tumour cohorts: gastro-oesophageal, colorectal, breast, and prostate cancer. An open-label run-in phase (aspirin 100 mg daily for 8 weeks) precedes double-blind randomisation (for participants aged under 75 years, aspirin 300 mg, aspirin 100 mg, or matched placebo in a 1:1:1 ratio; for patients aged 75 years or older, aspirin 100 mg or matched placebo in a 2:1 ratio). A preplanned analysis of feasibility, including recruitment rate, adherence, and toxicity was performed. The trial is registered with the International Standard Randomised Controlled Trials Number registry (ISRCTN74358648) and remains open to recruitment.  Findings:   After 2 years of recruitment (October, 2015, to October, 2017), 3494 participants were registered (115 in the gastro-oesophageal cancer cohort, 950 in the colorectal cancer cohort, 1675 in the breast cancer cohort, and 754 in the prostate cancer cohort); 2719 (85%) of 3194 participants who had finished the run-in period proceeded to randomisation, with rates consistent across tumour cohorts. End of run-in data were available for 2253 patients; 2148 (95%) of the participants took six or seven tablets per week. 11 (0·5%) of the 2253 participants reported grade 3 toxicity during the run-in period, with no upper gastrointestinal bleeding (any grade) in the gastro-oesophageal cancer cohort. The most frequent grade 1-2 toxicity overall was dyspepsia (246 [11%] of 2253 participants).  Interpretation:   Aspirin is well-tolerated after radical cancer therapy. Toxicity has been low and there is no evidence of a difference in adherence, acceptance of randomisation, or toxicity between the different cancer cohorts.

In this study, an oral microparticulate vaccine encapsulating tumor associated antigens (TAA) extracted from a murine prostate cancer cell line, TRAMP-C2, was formulated with the help of a spray dryer. Microparticles were characterized in vitro to determine their physicochemical properties and antigenicity. Formulated microparticles had an average size of 4.92 ± 0.5 μm with a zeta potential of 7.92 ± 1.2 mV. In order to test our formulation for its ability to demonstrate adequate antigen presentation and co-stimulation, microparticles were tested in vitro on murine dendritic cells. In vitro biological characterization demonstrated the activation of specific immune system markers such as CD80/86, CD40, MHC-I and MHC-II. Following in vitro characterization, in vivo anti-tumor efficacy of the oral microparticulate vaccine was evaluated in C57BL/6 male mice. Combination therapy of vaccine microparticles with cyclophosphamide and granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) demonstrated a five-fold reduction in tumor volume as compared to non-vaccinated mice. At the cellular level, cyclophosphamide and GM-CSF augmented the vaccine response as indicated by the reduced tumor volume and significant elevation of cytotoxic T-cell (CTL) CD8+ and (T-helper) CD4+ T-cells compared to mice receiving vaccine microparticles alone. Furthermore, our studies indicate a significant reduction in T-regulatory cells (T-regs) in mice receiving vaccine along with GM-CSF and cyclophosphamide, one of the immune escape mechanisms linked to tumor growth and progression.

Therefore, we investigated the role of these two proteins in CXCL12 mediated PC3 prostate cancer migration. Whereas PKC and PKD inhibitors do not affect the release of calcium in PC3 prostate cancer cells, both are involved in migration, particularly inhibition of the atypical PKC isoform PKCζ causes the greatest reduction in PC3 cell migration. Classical and/or Novel PKC isoform inhibition changes the shape of the PC3 cells, they show a more rounded morphology, whereas PKD inhibition causes prostate cancer cell to elongate. PKCζ inhibition causes the enlargement of PC3 area possibly due to dysregulated actin cytoskeletal control.

Materials & methods:   Fraction sizes of 8 Gy, 8.5 Gy, and 9 Gy were defined as levels 1, 2, and 3. The prescribed dose was delivered to at least 95% of the planning target volume. Image-guided, intensity-modulated radiotherapy was delivered to all patients. Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) was defined as acute toxicity of Grade 3 or higher. The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was defined as the level at which ≥30% of patients showed DLT. The recommended dose (RD) was defined to be one dose level below the MTD. If no patients at level 3 showed DLT, level 3 was defined as the recommended dose (RD).  Results:   Nine patients were enrolled in each level. All patients were low or intermediate risk. Median durations of follow-up for patients at levels 1-3 were 48.9 months, 42.6 months, and 18.4 months, respectively. Protocol treatment was completed for all patients. No patient showed DLT at each dose level. Level 3 was therefore designated as the RD for the phase II study.

We aimed to compare cancer incidence of ethnic Germans who migrated from the former Soviet Union to Germany (resettlers) to those living in Russia as well as to the German and the Russian general populations.  Methods:   The cancer registry of North Rhine-Westphalia identified incident cases of stomach, colorectal, lung, breast and prostate cancer in resettlers and the general population of the administrative district of Münster (Germany) between 2004 and 2013. The Tomsk cancer registry collected the same data in ethnic Germans and the general population of the Tomsk region (Russia). We used standardised incidence rate ratios (SIRs) to compare rates of resettlers and ethnic Germans with the respective general populations.  Results:   The total number of person-years under risk was 83,289 for ethnic Germans, 8,006,775 for the population of Tomsk, 219,604 for resettlers, and 20,516,782 for the population of Münster. Incidence of the five investigated cancer types among ethnic Germans did not differ from incidence of the general population of Tomsk. Compared to the general population of Tomsk, incidence among resettlers was higher for colorectal cancer in both sexes (females: SIR 1.45 [95% CI 1.14-1.83], males: SIR 1.56 [95% CI 1.23-1.97]), breast cancer in females (SIR 1.65 [95% CI 1.40-1.95]), and prostate cancer (SIR 1.64 [95% CI 1.34-2.01]). Incidence rates of these cancer types among resettlers were more similar to rates of the general population of Münster. Incidence of stomach and lung cancer did not differ between resettlers and the general population of Tomsk.  Conclusions:   After an average stay of 15 years, we observed that incidence of colorectal, breast and prostate cancer among resettlers converged to levels of the general population of Münster. Resettler's incidence of stomach and lung cancer, however, was comparable to incidence in their population of origin.

In this study, we investigated the anticancer activity of MHY4381, a newly synthesized HDAC inhibitor, against human prostate cancer cell lines and compared its efficacy with that of suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA), a well-known HDAC inhibitor. We assessed cell viability, apoptosis, cell cycle regulation, and other biological effects in the prostate cancer cells. We also evaluated a possible mechanism of MHY4381 on the apoptotic cell death pathway. The IC50 value of MHY4381 was lower in DU145 cells (IC50=0.31 µM) than in LNCaP (IC50=0.85 µM) and PC-3 cells (IC50=5.23 µM). In addition, the IC50 values of MHY4381 measured in this assay were significantly lower than those of SAHA against prostate cancer cell lines. MHY4381 increased the levels of acetylated histones H3 and H4 and reduced the expression of HDAC proteins in the prostate cancer cell lines. MHY4381 increased G2/M phase arrest in DU145 cells, and G1 arrest in LNCaP cells. It also activated reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, which induced apoptosis in the DU145 and LNCaP cells by increasing the ratio of Bax/Bcl-2 and releasing cytochrome c into the cytoplasm.

Studies of postmortem gene expression in zebrafish and mice and in the myocardium, liver, prostate, pericardial fluid, and blood of human cadavers have identified genes whose expression is increased after organismal death. Cancer can be considered a form of ""un-death"" since excessively proliferating cells are typically unusually resistant to apoptosis (programmed cell death), and are subject to strong selective pressure for ""uncontrolled life."" The changes in gene expression observed in organismal death, particularly in mammals (mice and humans), can be compared to that observed in human neoplasia, and the comparison of these expression patterns can inform us about human cancer. Here we present a hypothesis based on the following three tenets: (a) there will be distinct and opposing patterns of gene expression between the postmortem state and cancer with respect to key physiological outputs such as growth, apoptosis, invasion, and prognosis; (b) cancer cells considered more aggressive (e.g., derived from a metastasis and/or resistant to agents that suppress growth or induce apoptosis) will exhibit expression of relevant genes more unlike that of the postmortem condition while less aggressive neoplastic cells will exhibit gene expression more similar to the postmortem condition; and (c) targeting gene expression in cancer to produce a more postmortem-like pattern will promote less tumorigenic and less aggressive cell phenotypes. To evaluate components (a) and (b) of our hypothesis, we focus on previously published gene expression data from colorectal cancer (CRC) and colonic adenoma cells and compare that to postmortem expression data. This preliminary analysis in general supports our hypothesis, with more aggressive neoplastic cell types exhibiting gene expression patterns most unlike that found in the postmortem condition; this suggests that cancer and the postmortem condition represent opposing ends of a gene expression spectrum in the balance between life and death. Subsequently, we discuss the possibilities for further testing of the hypothesis, particularly for part (c), and we also discuss the possible implications of the hypothesis for cancer therapeutics.""","""['Michael Bordonaro']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Med Hypotheses""","""['TRIB3 Interacts With β-Catenin and TCF4 to Increase Stem Cell Features of Colorectal Cancer Stem Cells and Tumorigenesis.', 'Pien Tze Huang inhibits liver metastasis by targeting TGF-β signaling in an orthotopic model of colorectal cancer.', 'Fusobacterium nucleatum Increases Proliferation of Colorectal Cancer Cells and Tumor Development in Mice by Activating Toll-Like Receptor 4 Signaling to Nuclear Factor-κB, and Up-regulating Expression of MicroRNA-21.', 'Two Opposing Effects (Yin and Yang) Determine Cancer Progression.', 'Involvement of the multiple tumor suppressor genes and 12-lipoxygenase in human prostate cancer.

These rare cells (1-10 cells per mL of blood) warrant a poor prognosis and are correlated with shorter overall survival in several cancers (e.g., breast, prostate and colorectal). Currently, the anti-EpCAM-coated magnetic bead-based CTC capturing system is the gold standard test approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for enumerating CTCs in the bloodstream. This test is based on the use of magnetic beads coated with anti-EpCAM markers, which specifically target epithelial cancer cells. Many studies have illustrated that EpCAM is not the optimal marker for CTC detection. Indeed, CTCs are a heterogeneous subpopulation of cancer cells and are able to undergo an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) associated with metastatic proliferation and invasion. These CTCs are able to reduce the expression of cell surface epithelial marker EpCAM, while increasing mesenchymal markers such as vimentin. To address this technical hurdle, other isolation methods based on physical properties of CTCs have been developed. Microfluidic technologies enable a label-free approach to CTC enrichment from whole blood samples. The spiral microfluidic technology uses the inertial and Dean drag forces with continuous flow in curved channels generated within a spiral microfluidic chip. The cells are separated based on the differences in size and plasticity between normal blood cells and tumoral cells.

We aimed to investigate selected proteins contributing to calcium (Ca2+ ) signaling, (Orai, stromal interaction molecule (STIM), and transient receptor potential (TRP) channels) and involved in cancer hallmarks, as independent predictors of systemic recurrence after radical prostatectomy (RP).  Methods:   A case-control study including 112 patients with clinically localized PCa treated by RP between 2002 and 2009 and with at least 6-years' follow-up. Patients were divided into two groups according to the absence or presence of systemic recurrence. Expression levels of 10 proteins involved in Ca2+ signaling (TRPC1, TRPC4, TRPV5, TRPV6, TRPM8, STIM1, STIM2, Orai1, Orai2, and Orai3), were assessed by immunohistochemistry using tissue microarrays (TMAs) constructed from paraffin-embedded PCa specimens. The level of expression of the various transcripts in PCa was assessed using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) analysis. RNA samples for qPCR were obtained from fresh frozen tissue samples of PCa after laser capture microdissection on RP specimens. Relative gene expression was analyzed using the 2-▵▵Ct method.  Results:   Multivariate analysis showed that increased expression of TRPC1, TRPC4, TRPV5, TRPV6, TRPM8, and Orai2 was significantly associated with a lower risk of systemic recurrence after RP, independently of the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level, percentage of positive biopsies, and surgical margin (SM) status (P = .007, P = .01, P < .001, P = .0065, P = .007, and P = .01, respectively). For TRPC4, TRPV5, and TRPV6, this association was also independent of Gleason score and pT stage. Moreover, overexpression of TRPV6 and Orai2 was significantly associated with longer time to recurrence after RP (P = .048 and .023, respectively). Overexpression of TRPC4, TRPV5, TRPV6, and Orai2 transcripts was observed in group R- (3.71-, 5.7-, 1.14-, and 2.65-fold increase, respectively).

Plasma exosomes have excellent potential as real-time biomarkers to characterize the tumor because they are easily accessible in the blood and contain DNA, RNA, and protein from the parent cell. This study aims to investigate the characteristics of putative prostate-specific plasma extracellular vesicle (EV) markers and their relationship with clinical outcomes.  Methods and patients:   We investigated plasma EVs in a total of 89 patients with prostate cancer (PCa) at different stages of disease progression. EVs were isolated using both precipitation and ultracentrifugation methods; physical characterization was performed using dynamic light scattering, acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity, and velocity gradients. An immunocapture method was developed for the evaluation of prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA)-positive exosomes. Exosomal messenger RNA (mRNA) was quantified using droplet digital polymerase chain reaction for the expression of KLK3 and androgen receptor splice variant 7 (AR-V7) genes, which code prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and AR-V7, respectively. Serum sex steroids were measured using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectroscopy.  Results:   Isolated exosomes from patients with CRPC had a smaller hydrodynamic size than those isolated from localized patients with PCa, while AChE activity showed no difference. Moreover, no differences were observed after initiation of androgen deprivation therapy in serial patient samples. Velocity gradients identified that PSMA-positive exosomes occupied a specific fraction of isolated EVs. A total of 35 patients with CRPC had mRNA analyzed from isolated plasma exosomes. Detectable exosomal KLK3 corresponded with higher concomitant serum PSA measurements, as expected (mean, 112.6 vs 26.61 ng/mL; P = .065). Furthermore, detectable levels of AR-V7 mRNA were associated with a shorter time to progression (median, 16.0 vs 28.0 months; P = .0499). Furthermore, detectable exosomal AR-V7 was significantly associated with testosterone levels below the lower limit of quantification (<0.1 nM).  Conclusions:   Our results suggest that exosomal AR-V7 is correlated with lower sex steroid levels in CRPC patients with a poorer prognosis. PSMA immunocapture does not appear sufficient to isolate PCa-specific exosomes.""","""['France-Hélène Joncas', 'Fabrice Lucien', 'Mélanie Rouleau', 'Fannie Morin', 'Hon Sing Leong', 'Frédéric Pouliot', 'Yves Fradet', 'Caroline Gilbert', 'Paul Toren']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Androgen Receptor Splice Variant 7 and Efficacy of Taxane Chemotherapy in Patients With Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'AR-V7 in Peripheral Whole Blood of Patients with Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer: Association with Treatment-specific Outcome Under Abiraterone and Enzalutamide.', 'The Detection of Androgen Receptor Splice Variant 7 in Plasma-derived Exosomal RNA Strongly Predicts Resistance to Hormonal Therapy in Metastatic Prostate Cancer Patients.', 'EAU guidelines on prostate cancer.

PCa progression can be associated with obesity. Signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 (STAT3) plays a crucial role in PCa growth. However, whether STAT3 plays a role in high-fat diet (HFD)-associated PCa growth is unknown. Our data show that HFD feeding increases tumor size, STAT3 phosphorylation, and palmitic acid (PA) level in the xenograft tissues of the PCa-bearing xenograft mouse model. In vitro studies show that PA increases STAT3 expression and phosphorylation (STAT3-Y705) in PCa. Computational modeling suggests strong and stable binding between PA and unphosphorylated STAT3 at R593 and N538. The binding changes STAT3 structure and activity. Functional studies show that both STAT3 mutants (R583A and N538A) and STAT3 dominant negative significantly reduce PA-enhanced STAT3 phosphorylation, PA-increased PCa cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. In the xenograft mouse models, the HFD-increased tumor growth and STAT3 phosphorylation in tumors are reversed by STAT3 inhibition. Our study not only demonstrates the regulatory role of PA/STAT3 axis in HFD-associated PCa growth but also suggests a novel mechanism of how STAT3 is activated by PA.

Materials and methods:   We reviewed our prospectively maintained database of consecutive men who received transrectal ultrasound-guided 24-core biopsy as well as pre-biopsy multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging (mp-MRI). Of the 1276 men who were performed PBx in our institution from 2012 to July 2018, 491 patients conformed to the criteria. Negative predictive value (NPV) of negative mp-MRI (defined as PI-RADs < 3) combined prostate-specific antigen density (PSAD) were calculated. Models based on PI-RADs v2 were developed to predict the absence of clinically significant prostate cancer (CSPCa) and prostate cancer (PCa). Nomograms as well as receiver operating curves (ROC) were established to estimate the discrimination. Calibration curves were used to assess the concordance between predictive value and true risk. Decision curves were made to measure the overall net benefit.  Results:   Prostate cancer and CSPCa detection rates were 21.6%, 7.3% and 36.7%, 23.4% in PIRADs v2 < 3 cohort and PIRADs v2 = 3 cohort, respectively. Men with biopsy-proved CSPCa had higher prostate-specific antigen (PSA), lower prostate volume (PV) and higher PSAD (all p < 0.05 in the two cohorts) than patients with clinically insignificant prostate cancer (CIPCa) or negative results. NPV of negative mp-MRI for detection of PCa was much higher when the PSAD was less than 0.15 (p < 0.001) and 0.2 for CSPCa (p = 0.007). According to multivariate analysis, we developed the model comprising Age, PSAD and PI-RADs v2 to predict the absence of CSPCa and PCa. The area under the curve (AUC) of the model for non-CSPCa was 0.75 (95% CI 0.68-0.80, PSAD cutoff 0.20), better than 0.71 (95% CI 0.65-0.80, PSAD cutoff 0.15). As for model for non-PCa, the AUC was 0.76 (95% CI 0.70-0.80, PSAD cutoff 0.15), higher than 0.71(95% CI 0.67-0.78, PSAD cutoff 0.20). Internally validated calibration curves showed that the model might overestimated the risk of the absence of CSPCa when the threshold was between 53 and 72%, and if the threshold was between 72 and 87%, it might underestimate the risk. As for the absence of PCa, the model might overestimate the risk between 52 and 76%. Decision curves showed that a better clinical net benefit was met when the threshold was 55% for non-PCa and 70% for non-CSPCa.  Conclusions:   NPV of negative mp-MRI for detection of CSPCa and PCa was improved with decreasing PSAD. The nomograms based on PI-RADs v2, age and PSAD showed internally validated high discrimination and calibration for the absence of PCa and CSPCa. When the predictive value was greater than 70% for the absence of CSPCa and 55% for the absence of PCa, we could avoid unnecessary PBx to maximize net benefit.""","""['Yu Zhang', 'Na Zeng', 'FengBo Zhang', 'YangXinRui Huang', 'Ye Tian']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Int J Clin Oncol""","""['Performing Precise Biopsy in Naive Patients With Equivocal PI-RADS, Version 2, Score 3, Lesions: An MRI-based Nomogram to Avoid Unnecessary Surgical Intervention.', 'Can Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System Version 2 reduce unnecessary prostate biopsies in men with PSA levels of 4-10\xa0ng/ml?', 'The Role of PSA Density among PI-RADS v2.1 Categories to Avoid an Unnecessary Transition Zone Biopsy in Patients with PSA 4-20\u2009ng/mL.', 'Multivariate risk prediction tools including MRI for individualized biopsy decision in prostate cancer diagnosis: current status and future directions.', 'Positive Predictive Value of Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System Version 2 for the Detection of Clinically Significant Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.', 'A prospective study of the prostate health index density and multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging in diagnosing clinically significant prostate cancer.', 'PSA change after antibiotic treatment should not affect decisionmaking on performing a prostate biopsy.', 'Developing a predictive model for clinically significant prostate cancer by combining age, PSA density, and mpMRI.', 'Negative multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging for prostate cancer: further outcome and consequences.', 'New Diagnostic Model for Clinically Significant Prostate Cancer in Biopsy-Naïve Men With PIRADS 3.']"""

Nintedanib promoted growth inhibition and cell death in a dose-dependent manner, showing no tumor selectivity. Transgenic Adenocarcinoma of the Mouse Prostate (TRAMP) were treated with Nintedanib (10 mg/kg/day) in different stages of tumor development and the ventral prostate was examined for protein levels by means of immunohistochemistry and Western blotting and apoptosis evaluation. In vitro antiproliferative activity of Nintedanib was also assessed in nine human tumor cell lines. Early Nintedanib treatment has shown decreased levels of FGF-2, VEGFR-1, MMP-9 and HIF-1α and a significantly increased apoptosis of epithelial cells. Furthermore, late Nintedanib treatment decreased FGF-2, VEGFR-1 and FGFR-3 levels. Importantly, even after treatment discontinuation, treated animals displayed a significant decrease in VEGFR-1 as well as MMP-9. Although Nintedanib treatment in late stages of tumor growth has shown some good results, it is noteworthy that the drug presents the best tissue response when administered in the early stages of disease development.

Participants:   Our participants comprised a representative sample of Norwegian doctors in 2014/2015.  Primary and secondary outcome measures:   The primary outcome is whether doctors reported recommending their patients get screening for cancers of the breast, colorectum, lung, prostate, cervix and ovaries. We examined doctors' characteristics predicting adherence to the guidelines, including gender, age, and work in specialist or general practice. The secondary outcomes are reasons given for recommending or not recommending screening for breast and prostate cancer.  Results:   Our response rate was 75% (1158 of 1545). 94% recommended screening for cervical cancer, 89% for breast cancer (both established as national programmes), 42% for colorectal cancer (upcoming national programme), 41% for prostate cancer, 21% for ovarian cancer and 17% for lung cancer (not recommended by health authorities). General practitioners (GPs) adhered to guidelines more than other doctors. Early detection was the most frequent reason for recommending screening; false positives and needless intervention were the most frequent reasons for not recommending it.  Conclusions:   A large majority of doctors claimed that they recommended cancer screening in accordance with national guidelines. Among doctors recommending screening contrary to the guidelines, GPs did so to a lesser degree than other specialties. Different expectations of doctors' roles could be a possible explanation for the variations in practice and justifications. The effectiveness of governing instruments, such as guidelines, incentives or reporting measures, can depend on which professional role(s) a doctor is loyal to, and policymakers should be aware of these different roles in clinical governance.""","""['Berit Bringedal', 'Atle Fretheim', 'Stein Nilsen', 'Karin Isaksson Rø']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""BMJ Open""","""[""Differences among primary care physicians' adherence to 2009 ACOG guidelines for cervical cancer screening."", 'Physician adherence to U.S. Preventive Services Task Force mammography guidelines.', 'Adherence to guidelines on antibiotic treatment for respiratory tract infections in various categories of physicians: a retrospective cross-sectional study of data from electronic patient records.', ""Family doctors' knowledge and self-reported care of type 2 diabetes patients in comparison to the clinical practice guideline: cross-sectional study."", 'Evidence for prevention and screening: recommendations in adults.', 'Practices of Cancer Screening for Average-Risk Cancer Patients Among Primary Healthcare Center Physicians in Al-Qassim Region, Saudi Arabia.', 'Screening asymptomatic men for prostate cancer: A comparison of international guidelines on prostate-specific antigen testing.', ""Barriers and attitudes towards cervical cancer screening in primary healthcare in Poland - doctors' perspective."", 'Motivators of Inappropriate Ovarian Cancer Screening: A Survey of Women and Their Clinicians.']"""

A total of 127 localized PCa patients from GSE116918, 268 patients from TCGA database and 77 patients from GSE70770 were enrolled in our study. TIMMs were evaluated by the CIBERSORT method. Patients with high TIMMs had a significantly poorer recurrence free survival (RFS) (P = 0.017, P = 0.0063 and P = 0.001) in the three sets. In the multivariate analysis, the presence of high TIMMs (HR = 3.026, P = 0.023; HR = 2.679, P = 0.017; HR = 2.648, P = 0.005) was identified as an independent prognostic factor for RFS in the three sets. Harrell's Concordance index (C-index) increased in all three sets after combining TIMMs with traditional risk factors (PSA, clinical stage(T) and Gleason score). Gene Set Enrichment Analysis showed that T cell receptor signaling pathway, B cell receptor signaling pathway and primary immunodeficiency were significantly enriched in the low TIMMs group. TIMMs could serve as an independent prognostic factor for BCR in localized PCa patients after RP.

Patients and methods:   This was a phase IV, prospective, open-label, multicenter, real-world study. Patients were prescribed ENZA or AA+P at the treating physician's discretion. Computerized tests of 4 cognitive domains (Cogstate), patient-reported outcomes (European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire-Core 30 [EORTC QLQ-30], Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue [FACIT-Fatigue], Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Cognitive Function [FACT-Cog]), and patient/caregiver surveys were assessed at baseline and 2 months. Safety data were collected.  Results:   Of 100 treated patients, 92 were evaluable (46/arm). Baseline characteristics were similar, with mild cognitive impairment observed in ∼20% of patients. The FACIT-Fatigue demonstrated a statistically significant worsening from baseline of -4.00 (95% confidence interval, -6.61 to -1.39) for ENZA compared with AA+P, -0.01 (95% confidence interval, -2.40 to 2.38). Overall, more adverse events (AEs) and more AEs of fatigue were reported with ENZA versus AA+P (52% vs. 36% and 26% vs. 8%, respectively). Grade 3/4 AEs were similar (4% vs. 6%). Unique neuropsychiatric AEs reported with ENZA included amnesia, cognitive disorders, memory impairment, and confusional state; those for AA+P included cerebrovascular accident, presyncope, and spinal cord compression. Clinically meaningful cognitive decline was seen in 4 patients on ENZA versus 1 patient on AA+P. However, the overall mean changes from baseline for the Cogstate tests, the EORTC QLQ-C30, and the FACT-Cog assessment were similar and showed no meaningful change.

The E3 ubiquitin ligase EDD modifies substrate proteins through ubiquitination and is involved in the regulation of cell proliferation and tumorigenesis. However, its role in docetaxel resistance of prostate cancer is unknown. Here, we show that EDD is upregulated in docetaxel-resistant HRPC cells, as well as in human HRPC treated with docetaxel chemotherapy. Functionally, EDD knockdown resensitizes HRPC cells to docetaxel in vitro and in vivo, and in reverse, EDD overexpression promotes docetaxel resistance. We further show that the Wnt/β-Catenin signaling is activated in docetaxel-resistant HRPC cells, which can be promoted by EDD. Finally, inhibiting Wnt signaling through β-Catenin knockdown remarkably attenuates EDD-mediated docetaxel resistance, suggesting that the activated Wnt/β-Catenin signaling is a key contributor to EDD-conferred docetaxel resistance in HRPC cells. Altogether, our study uncovers a positive role of EDD in docetaxel resistance in prostate cancer, and further links it with the regulation of Wnt/β-Catenin signaling.""","""['Pan Bian', 'Zhongling Dou', 'Zhaohui Jia', 'Wensheng Li', 'Dong Pan']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Life Sci""","""['The EDD E3 ubiquitin ligase ubiquitinates and up-regulates beta-catenin.', 'HECT (Homologous to the E6-AP Carboxyl Terminus)-Type Ubiquitin E3 Ligase ITCH Attenuates Cardiac Hypertrophy by Suppressing the Wnt/β-Catenin Signaling Pathway.', 'Wnt-Dependent Inactivation of the Groucho/TLE Co-repressor by the HECT E3\xa0Ubiquitin Ligase Hyd/UBR5.', 'Wnt/Beta-Catenin Signaling and Prostate Cancer Therapy Resistance.', 'Role of Wnt/β-catenin signaling in drug resistance of pancreatic cancer.', 'Glucocorticoid Receptor and β-Catenin Interact in Prostate Cancer Cells and Their Co-Inhibition Attenuates Tumorsphere Formation, Stemness, and Docetaxel Resistance.', 'Molecular Landscape of LncRNAs in Prostate Cancer: A focus on pathways and therapeutic targets for intervention.', 'Wnt/β-catenin signal transduction pathway in prostate cancer and associated drug resistance.', 'BoxCar and shotgun proteomic analyses reveal molecular networks regulated by UBR5 in prostate cancer.', 'E3 Ubiquitin Ligase in Anticancer Drugdsla Resistance: Recent Advances and Future Potential.']"""

The mutant p53 protein in tumor cells can form aggregates which contribute to the dominant-negative effect over the wild-type p53 protein, causing loss of p53 tumor suppression or gain of novel oncogenic functions. Mutations in p53 have been implicated in the pathogenesis of primary prostate cancer (PCa), and are often detected in recurrent and metastatic disease. Thus, targeting mutant p53 may constitute an alternative therapeutic strategy for advanced PCa for which there are no other viable options.  Methods:   In this study, we used immunoprecipitation, immunofluorescence, clonogenic survival, and cell proliferation assays, flow cytometric analysis and in vivo xenograft to investigate the biological effects of ReACp53, a cell-permeable peptide inhibitor of p53 aggregation, on mutant p53-carrying PCa cells.  Results:   Our results show that ReACp53 targets amyloid aggregates of mutant p53 protein and restores the p53 nuclear function as transcriptional factor, induces mitochondrial cell death and reduces DNA synthesis of mutant p53-carrying PCa cells; ReACp53 also inhibits xenograft tumor growth in vivo.

However, no prior research studied this history's actual impact on the survival of CRC. In the paper, we study the effects of having a malignancy preceding CRC diagnosis on its survival outcomes.  Methods:   CRC patients diagnosed during 1973-2008 were reviewed using the SEER 18 database. We calculated overall survival and cancer-specific survival of subsequent CRC, and more specifically stage IV CRC, using Kaplan-Meier test and adjusted Cox models.  Results:   A total 550,325 CRC patients were reviewed, of whom 31,663 had history of a prior malignancy. The most commonly reported sites of a prior malignancy were: prostate, breast, urinary bladder, lung, and endometrium. Patients with history of a prior non-leukemic malignancy or history of a prior leukemia were found to have worse overall survival (HR = 1.165 95%CI = 1.148-1.183, P < 0.001) and (HR = 1.825 95%CI = 1.691-1.970, P < 0.001), respectively. However, CRC patients with history of a prior non-leukemic malignancy showed an improved colorectal cancer-specific survival (HR = .930 95%CI = .909-.952, P < 0.001). Analysis of stage IV CRC patients showed that patients with history of any non-leukemic malignancy did not have a significant change in overall survival. Whereas, patients with a prior leukemia showed a worse overall survival (HR = 1.535, 95%CI = 1.303-1.809, P < 0.001). When analyzed separately, right CRC and left CRC showed similar survival patterns.  Conclusion:   A prior malignancy before CRC -in general- can be associated with worse clinical survival outcomes. These worse outcomes are not observed in stage IV CRC.

The receptors for HER2 are overexpressed in various human cancers, such as breast and ovarian cancer. The relatively low expression of this antigen on normal tissues makes it a clinically useful molecular target for tumor imaging and targeted therapy. HER2 overexpression is correlated with aggressive tumor behavior and poor clinical outcomes. Thus, HER2 has become an important prognostic and predictive factor, as well as a potential molecular target. Due to the heterogeneity of breast cancer and possible discordance in HER2 status between primary tumors and distant metastases, assessment of HER2 expression by noninvasive imaging is important. Molecular imaging of HER2 expression may provide essential prognostic and predictive information concerning disseminated cancer and aid in the selection of an optimal therapy. Another tumor-specific antigen is MUC1, which is silent on normal tissues, but overexpressed in almost all human epithelial cell cancers, including >90% of human breast, ovarian, pancreatic, colorectal, lung, prostate, and gastric cancers and is a promising tumor antigen with diagnostic as well as the therapeutic potential of cancer. Radiolabeled small peptide ligands are attractive as probes for molecular imaging, as they reach and bind the target receptor efficiently and clear from blood and non-target organs faster than bulky antibodies. In this study, HER2 and MUC1-based peptides were synthesized and preclinically evaluated in an effort to develop peptide-based SPECT radiopharmaceuticals derived from tumor-associated antigens for the detection of breast cancer. Our findings demonstrate that the tumor antigen peptides radiolabeled efficiently with 99mTc and showed high metabolic stability in human plasma in vitro. The data from breast tumor cell binding confirmed the high affinity (in low nanomolar range) towards respective breast cancer cell lines. In healthy mice, 99mTc-labeled peptides displayed favorable pharmacokinetics, with high excretion by the renal system. In tumor xenografts nude mice models, good uptake by the SKBR3, MCF7, and T47D tumors were found, with good tumor-to-blood and tumor to muscle ratios. Additionally, tumor lesions can be seen in γ-camera imaging.

Exposure to heavy metals and their association with prostate cancer risk has been studied extensively, but combined effects remain largely inconclusive.  Objectives:   To elucidate the association between serum concentrations of heavy metals and prostate cancer risk.  Methods:   Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) was used to determine the concentrations of a panel of 10 heavy metals (Mn, Cu, Zn, As, Se, Sb, Co, Cu, Cd and Pb) in serum samples of 141 cases and 114 controls in the Singapore Prostate Cancer Study. Linear probit regression models were used to estimate risk differences (RDs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the associations between log-centered serum metal concentrations and prostate cancer risk with adjustment for potential confounders. Bayesian kernel machine regression (BKMR) models were used to account for nonlinear, interactive, and joint metal effects.  Results:   Using probit regression, four heavy metals (As, Zn, Mn, Sb) were significantly and positively associated with prostate cancer risk in the unadjusted models. Using BKMR analysis, both As and Zn had positive risk differences on prostate cancer risk when all other metals were held fixed at the 25th and 50th percentiles (RD, 25th percentile: As: 0.15, Zn: 0.19, RD, 50th percentile: As: 0.45, Zn: 0.37). In addition, the overall mixture risk difference was positive and the 95% credible intervals did not include 0 when all metals in the mixture were jointly above their 55th percentile, as compared to when all metals were below their median values.  Conclusions:   In summary, we found positive associations between the serum levels of As and Zn and prostate cancer risk on the risk difference scale using BKMR models. The overall mixture effect was also associated with increased prostate cancer risk.

Previously, miR-153 has been identified to be overexpressed in prostate cancer. miR-153 played an important role in promoting proliferation of human prostate cancer cells and presented a novel mechanism of microRNA-mediated direct suppression of phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) expression in prostate cancer cells. Until now, little is known about the clinical significance of miR-153 expression in prostate cancer.The miR-153 expression in 143 pairs of prostate cancer and adjacent non-cancerous prostate tissues was measured by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analysis. Student t test was conducted for intergroup comparison. Pearson correlation test was used for correlation analysis. Survival curves were carried out by the Kaplan-Meier method and evaluated using the log-rank test. Multivariable Cox proportional hazard risk regression model was performed to screen the independent factor affected the prognosis of prostate cancer patients.qRT-PCR analysis showed that the expression of miR-153 was significantly increased in the prostate cancer tissues in comparison with the adjacent noncancerous prostate tissues (P < .001). The high expression of miR-153 in prostate cancer tissues is closely correlated with aggressive clinical pathological parameters such as lymph node metastasis (P = .001); bone metastasis (P < .001); Gleason score (P < .001); and tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) stage (P < .001). Prostate cancer patients with a high expression of miR-153 had an evidently lower 5-year overall survival as compared with those with a low expression of miR-153 (P = .019). Notably, the multivariate Cox regression analysis indicated that miR-153 expression was an independent factor for predicting the 5-year overall survival of prostate cancer patients (hazard ratio [HR] = 2.481, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.582-10.727; P = .018).Our study demonstrated that high miR-153 expression was significantly associated with a poor overall survival independently of other factors in prostate cancer.

As compared to vehicle-treated rats, lower prostate weights were found in the BPH rats that received PRE 1 g/kg bw. In addition, the PRE treatment down-regulated the androgen receptor (AR) expression in the dorsolateral prostate of those rats. In human prostate cancer cell line, LNCaP, PRE could reduce the cell growth, down-regulate the expression of AR and suppress prostate-specific antigen (PSA) secretion. Moreover, PRE also inhibited an activity of 5α-reductase from rat liver microsomes and the mutagenicity of Salmonella Typhimurium induced by standard mutagen. These results demonstrate that PRE altered testosterone-induced BPH in rats and retarded prostate cancer cell growth by modulating AR expression. It is therefore recommended that further investigation is undertaken into the chemopreventive potential of PRE in androgen-AR mediated diseases. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: This study revealed the mechanisms of purple rice extract on testosterone-induced rat benign prostatic hyperplasia. Such information, purple rice components show promise as an effective chemopreventive agent for prostatic hyperplasia prevention by alternating the influence of testosterone through its receptor.

Reduced KAT5 expression was significantly associated with high mortality in prostate cancer patients. Furthermore, KAT5 overexpression increased the level of apoptotic markers, such as cleaved-caspase 3, in LNCaP cells, thus enhancing the apoptotic death of LNCaP cells.

Studies have demonstrated that high serum IL-8 levels correlate with poor prognosis in many malignant tumors. Preclinical studies have shown that IL-8 blockade may reduce mesenchymal features in tumor cells, making them less resistant to treatment.  Methods:   Fifteen patients with metastatic or unresectable locally advanced solid tumors were enrolled in this 3 + 3 dose-escalation trial at four dose levels (4, 8, 16, or 32 mg/kg). HuMax-IL8 was given IV every 2 weeks, and patients were followed for safety and immune monitoring at defined intervals up to 52 weeks.  Results:   All enrolled patients (five chordoma, four colorectal, two prostate, and one each of ovarian, papillary thyroid, chondrosarcoma, and esophageal) received at least one dose of HuMax-IL8. Eight patients had received three or more prior lines of therapy and five patients had received prior immunotherapy. Treatment-related adverse events occurred in five patients (33%), mostly grade 1. Two patients receiving the 32 mg/kg dose had grade 2 fatigue, hypophosphatemia, and hypersomnia. No dose-limiting toxicities were observed, and maximum tolerated dose was not reached. Although no objective tumor responses were observed, 11 patients (73%) had stable disease with median treatment duration of 24 weeks (range, 4-54 weeks). Serum IL-8 was significantly reduced on day 3 of HuMax-IL8 treatment compared to baseline (p = 0.0004), with reductions in IL-8 seen at all dose levels.

Myc-associated zinc-finger protein (MAZ) is a well-documented oncogene involved in the progression and metastasis of multiple cancer types, even in PCa. However, the clinical significance and biological roles of MAZ in bone metastasis of PCa remain unclear.  Methods:   MAZ expression was examined in PCa tissues with bone metastasis, PCa tissues without bone metastasis and metastatic bone tissues by real-time PCR and immunohistochemistry (IHC), respectively. Statistical analysis was performed to evaluate the clinical correlation between MAZ expression and clinicopathological features and bone metastasis-free survival in PCa patients. Biological roles of MAZ in bone metastasis of PCa were investigated both in vitro by transwell assay, and in vivo by a mouse model of left cardiac ventricle inoculation. The bioinformatics analysis, western blot, pull-down assays, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and luciferase reporter assays were applied to demonstrate and examine the relationship between MAZ and its potential downstream signalling pathway. TaqMan copy number assay was performed to identify the underlying mechanism responsible for MAZ overexpression in PCa tissues.  Results:   MAZ expression is elevated in PCa tissues with bone metastasis compared with that in PCa tissues without bone metastasis, and is further increased in metastatic bone tissues. High expression of MAZ positively correlates with poor overall and bone metastasis-free survival in PCa patients. Upregulating MAZ elevates, while silencing MAZ represses the invasion and migration abilities of PCa cells in vitro and bone metastasis ability in vivo. Our results further reveal that MAZ promotes bone metastasis of PCa dependent on KRas signalling, although MAZ transcriptionally upregulates KRas and HRas expression, where the Ral guanine nucleotide exchange factor (RalGEF) signaling is responsible for the different roles of KRas and HRas in mediating the pro-bone metastasis of MAZ in PCa. Finally, our results indicate that recurrent gains contribute to MAZ overexpression in a small portion of PCa tissues.  Conclusion:   These results indicate that the MAZ/Kras/ RalGEF signalling axis plays a crucial role in promoting PCa cell bone metastasis, suggesting a potential therapeutic utility of MAZ in bone metastasis of PCa.""","""['Qing Yang', 'Chuandong Lang', 'Zhengquan Wu', 'Yuhu Dai', 'Shaofu He', 'Wei Guo', 'Shuai Huang', 'Hong Du', 'Dong Ren', 'Xinsheng Peng']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""J Exp Clin Cancer Res""","""['Oncogenic miR-210-3p promotes prostate cancer cell EMT and bone metastasis via NF-κB signaling pathway.', 'Copy number gain of ZEB1 mediates a double-negative feedback loop with miR-33a-5p that regulates EMT and bone metastasis of prostate cancer dependent on TGF-β signaling.', 'Downregulation of miR-141-3p promotes bone metastasis via activating NF-κB signaling in prostate cancer.', 'Ras and Wnt Interaction Contribute in Prostate Cancer Bone Metastasis.', 'Advances of Zinc Signaling Studies in Prostate Cancer.', 'NOP2-mediated m5C Modification of c-Myc in an EIF3A-Dependent Manner to Reprogram Glucose Metabolism and Promote Hepatocellular Carcinoma Progression.', 'FOXA1-induced LINC00621 promotes lung adenocarcinoma progression via activating the TGF-β signaling pathway.', 'PCGF6/MAX/KDM5D facilitates MAZ/CDK4 axis expression and pRCC progression by hypomethylation of the DNA promoter.', 'Plasma and urinary extracellular vesicles as a source of RNA biomarkers for prostate cancer in liquid biopsies.', 'Oncogenic KRAS alters splicing factor phosphorylation and alternative splicing in lung cancer.']"""

This imaging technique shows areas of enhanced osteoblastic activity and blood flow. In this work, 18F-NaF PET/CT was investigated for response assessment to single fraction stereotactic ablative body radiotherapy (SABR) to bone metastases in prostate cancer patients.  Methods:   Patients with bone metastases in a prospective trial treated with single fraction SABR received a 18F-NaF PET/CT scan prior to and 6 months post-SABR. The SUVmax in the tumour was determined and the difference between before and after SABR determined. The change in uptake in the non-tumour bone was also measured as a function of the received SABR dose.  Results:   Reduction in SUVmax was observed in 29 of 33 lesions 6 months after SABR (mean absolute decrease in SUVmax 17.7, 95% CI 25.8 to - 9.4, p = 0.0001). Of the three lesions with increased SUVmax post-SABR, two were from the same patient and located in the vertebral column. Both were determined to be local progression in addition to one fracture. The third lesion (in a rib) was shown to be controlled locally but suffered from a fracture at 24 months. Progression adjacent to the treated volume was observed in two patients. The non-tumour bone irradiated showed increased loss in uptake with increasing dose, with a median loss in uptake of 23.3% for bone receiving 24 Gy.  Conclusion: 18F-NaF PET/CT for response assessment of bone metastases to single fraction SABR indicates high rates of reduction of osteoblastic activity in the tumour and non-tumour bone receiving high doses. The occurrence of marginal recurrence indicates use of larger clinical target volumes may be warranted in treatment of bone metastases.

The aim of this study to prospectively investigate the impact on prostate cancer clinical management of the uro-oncology MDT meeting at an Italian tertiary referral center.  Methods:   All cases discussed over an 18-months period at San Luigi Hospital uro-oncology MDT were prospectively evaluated for the impact of the MDT discussion on PCa clinical decision-making. Dilemma and management plan in the monodisciplinary visit before and/or after primary treatment were recorded. Subsequently, the MDT discussed the case and reached a consensus decision, which was also recorded. Changes in diagnostic assessment and patient management from pre- to post-MDT meeting were evaluated by a consultant urologist.  Results:   Overall, 201 patients, of which 99, 81 and 21 with local, advanced and metastatic disease respectively, were selected for MDT evaluation. The most frequent reasons for MDT approach after either PCa diagnosis or primary treatment were metastatic disease or locally advanced disease/positive surgical margins/biochemical recurrence, respectively. Patients with local, advanced and metastatic disease had a significative change of diagnostic/therapeutic management in 23.2%, 46.9% and 33.4%, respectively (P<0.001).

We have reported the inhibition of MTA1 by resveratrol and its potent analog pterostilbene in vitro and in vivo. We have demonstrated that pterostilbene treatment blocks the progression of prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia and adenocarcinoma in mouse models by inhibiting MTA1 expression and signaling. In the current study, we investigated the MTA1 targeted anticancer effects of Gnetin C, a resveratrol dimer, in comparison with resveratrol and pterostilbene. Using DU145 and PC3M PCa cells, we found that Gnetin C downregulates MTA1 more potently than resveratrol and pterostilbene. Further, Gnetin C demonstrated significant MTA1-mediated inhibitory effect on cell viability, colony formation, and migration, while showing a more potent induction of cell death than resveratrol or pterostilbene. In addition, we identified Gnetin C-induced substantial ETS2 (erythroblastosis E26 transformation-specific 2) downregulation, which is not only MTA1-dependent, but is also independent of MTA1 as a possible mechanism for the superior anticancer efficacy of Gnetin C in PCa. Together, these findings underscore the importance of novel potent resveratrol dimer, Gnetin C, as a clinically promising agent for the future development of chemopreventive and possibly combinatorial therapeutic approaches in PCa.""","""['Avinash Kumar', 'Kshiti Dholakia', 'Gabriela Sikorska', 'Luis A Martinez', 'Anait S Levenson']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Nutrients""","""['Therapeutic Potential of Gnetin C in Prostate Cancer: A Pre-Clinical Study.', 'Pterostilbene acts through metastasis-associated protein 1 to inhibit tumor growth, progression and metastasis in prostate cancer.', 'Metastasis-associated protein 1-mediated antitumor and anticancer activity of dietary stilbenes for prostate cancer chemoprevention and therapy.', 'Targeting MTA1/HIF-1α signaling by pterostilbene in combination with histone deacetylase inhibitor attenuates prostate cancer progression.', 'MTA family of proteins in prostate cancer: biology, significance, and therapeutic opportunities.', 'Gnetin C Intercepts MTA1-Associated Neoplastic Progression in Prostate Cancer.', 'A circadian rhythm-related gene signature for predicting relapse risk and immunotherapeutic effect in prostate adenocarcinoma.', 'Dietary stilbenes as modulators of specific miRNAs in prostate cancer.', 'Dietary Pterostilbene for MTA1-Targeted Interception in High-Risk Premalignant Prostate Cancer.', 'Dietary Factors and Prostate Cancer Development, Progression, and Reduction.']"""

We propose to integrate dense block minimization into 3D cycle-consistent generative adversarial networks (cycleGAN) framework to effectively learn the nonlinear mapping between MRI and CT pairs. A cohort of 17 patients with co-registered CT and MR pairs were used to test the deep learning-based sCT generation method by leave-one-out cross-validation. Image quality between the sCT and CT images, gamma analysis passing rate, dose-volume metrics, distal range displacement, and the individual pencil beam Bragg peak shift between sCT- and CT-based proton plans were evaluated. The average mean absolute error (MAE) was 51.32 ± 16.91 HU. The relative differences of the statistics of the PTV dose-volume histogram (DVH) metrics in between sCT and CT were generally less than 1%. Mean values of dose difference, absolute dose difference (in percent of the prescribed dose) were -0.07% ± 0.07% and 0.23% ± 0.08%. Mean gamma analysis pass rate of 1 mm/1%, 2 mm/2%, 3 mm/3% criteria with 10% dose threshold were 92.39% ± 5.97%, 97.95% ± 2.95% and 98.97% ± 1.62% respectively. The median, mean and standard deviation of absolute maximum range differences were 0.09 cm and 0.23 ± 0.25 cm.

This study compared the association between insurance coverage at diagnosis and cancer-specific mortality (CSM; insurance sensitivity) in 6 cancers.  Patients and methods:   Using the SEER cancer registry, data were abstracted for individuals diagnosed with ovarian, pancreatic, lung, colorectal, prostate, or breast cancer in 2007 through 2010. The association between insurance coverage at diagnosis and CSM was modeled using a Fine and Gray competing-risks regression adjusted for demographics. An interaction term combining insurance status and cancer type was used to test whether insurance sensitivity differed between cancers. Separate models were fit for each cancer. To control for lead-time bias and to assess whether insurance sensitivity may be mediated by earlier diagnosis and treatment, additional models were fit adjusting for disease stage and treatment.  Results:   Lack of insurance was associated with an increased hazard of CSM in all cancers (P<.01). The magnitude of the effect differed significantly between cancers (Pinteraction=.04), ranging from an adjusted hazard ratio of 1.13 (95% CI, 1.01-1.28) in ovarian and 1.19 (95% CI, 1.11-1.29) in pancreatic cancer to 2.19 (95% CI, 2.02-2.37) in breast and 2.98 (95% CI, 2.54-3.49) in prostate cancer. The benefit of insurance was attenuated after adjusting for stage and treatment (eg, screening/early treatment effect), with the largest reductions in prostate, breast, and colorectal cancers.  Conclusions:   Greater insurance sensitivity was seen in screening-detected malignancies with effective treatments for early-stage disease (eg, prostate, breast, and colorectal cancers). Given that this differential is significantly reduced after adjusting for stage and treatment, our results suggest that a significant portion (but not all) of the benefit of insurance coverage is due to detection and treatment of certain curable early-stage cancers.""","""['Alexander P Cole', 'Chang Lu', 'Marieke J Krimphove', 'Julie Szymaniak', 'Maxine Sun', 'Sean A Fletcher', 'Stuart R Lipsitz', 'Brandon A Mahal', 'Paul L Nguyen', 'Toni K Choueiri', 'Adam S Kibel', 'Adil H Haider', 'Quoc-Dien Trinh']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""J Natl Compr Canc Netw""","""['The association between insurance status and prostate cancer outcomes: implications for the Affordable Care Act.', 'Disparities in disease presentation in the four screenable cancers according to health insurance status.', 'Does increasing insurance improve outcomes for US cancer patients?', 'Trends in the prevalence of malignancy among patients admitted with acute heart failure and associated outcomes: a nationwide population-based study.', 'Prostate-Specific Antigen-Based Screening for Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Evidence Review for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force Internet.', 'The Uninsured are a Distinct Population in a Breast Cancer Cohort, with Unique Screening, Staging, and Outcomes.', 'Elderly Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma Cancer Patients Could Benefit From Postoperative Chemotherapy.', 'Community access to primary care is an important geographic disparity among ovarian cancer patients undergoing cytoreductive surgery.', 'Impact of racial disparities and insurance status in patients with bone sarcomas in the USA : a population-based cohort study.', 'Impact of Insurance Status on Outcomes in Individuals with AIDS-Defining Cancers.']"""

This method uses a pharmacokinetic analysis based on the time course of a reference region, such as muscle, rather than arterial input function. However, it is difficult to manually define a homogeneous reference region. In the present study, we developed a method for automatic extraction of the reference region using a clustering algorithm based on a time course pattern for DCE-MRI studies of patients with prostate cancer.  Methods:   Two feature values related to the shape of the time course were extracted from the time course of all voxels in the DCE-MRI images. Each voxel value of T1-weighted images acquired before administration were also added as anatomical data. Using this three-dimensional feature vector, all voxels were segmented into five clusters by the Gaussian mixture model, and one of these clusters that included the gluteus muscle was selected as the reference region.  Results:   Each region of arterial vessel, muscle, and fat was segmented as a different cluster from the tumor and normal tissues in the prostate. In the extracted reference region, other tissue elements including scattered fat and blood vessels were removed from the muscle region.

Previously identified HSP90 inhibitors bind to the N-terminal pocket of HSP90, which blocks binding to HIF-1α and induces HIF-1α degradation. N-terminal inhibitors have failed in the clinic as single therapy treatments partially because they induce a heat shock response. SM molecules are HSP90 inhibitors that bind to the C-terminus of HSP90 and do not induce a heat shock response. The effects of these C-terminal inhibitors on HIF-1α are unreported.  Methods:   HCT116, MDA-MB-231, PC3, and HEK293T cells were treated with HSP90 inhibitors. qRT-PCR and western blotting was performed to assess mRNA and protein levels of HIF-1α, HSP- and RACK1-related genes. siRNA was used to knockdown RACK1, while MG262 was used to inhibit proteasome activity. Dimethyloxalylglycine (DMOG) was used to inhibit activity of the prolyl hydroxylases (PHDs). Anti-angiogenic activity of HSP90 inhibitors was assessed using a HUVEC tubule formation assay.  Results:   We show that SM compounds decrease HIF-1α target expression at the mRNA and protein level under hypoxia in colorectal, breast and prostate cancer cells, leading to cell death, without inducing a heat shock response. Surprisingly, we found that when the C-terminal of HSP90 is inhibited, HIF-1α degradation occurs through the proteasome and prolyl hydroxylases in an oxygen-dependent manner even in very low levels of oxygen (tumor hypoxia levels). RACK1 was not required for proteasomal degradation of HIF-1α.

Pencil beam scanning (PBS) in similar fractionation allows better dose distribution and makes proton therapy more available for such patients. The purpose of this study is the feasibility of extreme proton hypofractionated radiotherapy and publication of early clinical results.  Methods:   Two hundred patients with early-stage prostate cancer were treated with IMPT (intensity-modulated proton therapy), extreme hypofractionated schedule (36.25 GyE in five fractions) between February 2013 and December 2015. Mean age of the patients was 64.3 years, and the mean value of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) before treatment was 6.83 μg/L (0.6-17.3 μg/L). Ninety-three patients (46.5%) were in the low-risk group. One hundred and seven patients (53.5%) were in the intermediate-risk group. Twenty-nine patients (14.5%) had neoadjuvant hormonal therapy, and no patients had adjuvant hormonal therapy. Acute toxicity, late toxicity and short-term results were evaluated.  Results:   All patients finished radiotherapy without interruptions. The median follow-up time was 36 months. The mean treatment time was 9.5 days (median 9 days). Acute toxicity according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v 4.0 was (gastrointestinal toxicity) GI (grade) G1-17%, G2-3.5%; (genitourinary toxicity) GU G1-40%, G2-19%; and no G3 toxicity was observed. Late toxicity was GI G1-19%, G2-5.5%; GU G1-17%, G2-4%; and no G3 toxicity was observed. PSA relapse was observed in one patient (1.08%) in the low-risk group (pelvic lymph node involvement was detected) and in seven patients (6.5%) in the intermediate-risk group (three lymph node metastases, two lymph node and bone metastases, two PSA relapses). No patient died of prostate cancer, and three patients died from other reasons. No local recurrence of cancer in the prostate was observed.

The current study will examine the effect of weight status on psychosocial outcomes among patients diagnosed with breast cancer, prostate cancer, and colon cancer.  Methods:   This retrospective study included 4159 patients over the age of 55 who were diagnosed with postmenopausal breast (52.2%), prostate (38.7%), or colon cancer (9.1%). Prior to treatment, patients were screened for problem-related distress using a 33-item touch screen-based instrument. Descriptive statistics were generated for each cancer type and one-way analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) used to determine significant differences in distress by weight (nonobese: <30 kg/m2 vs obese: ≥30 kg/m2 ).  Results:   A higher prevalence of biopsychosocial problem-related distress was reported by patients with breast cancer (M = 4.3) compared with prostate (M = 2.8) and colon cancer (M = 3.8). Obese breast and prostate cancer patients reported higher levels of problem-related distress compared with nonobese patients (P < .05), whereas an opposite trend was noted for patients with colon cancer.  Conclusion:   The current study found notable obesity-related differences among patients diagnosed with postmenopausal breast cancer or prostate cancer, with excess weight consistently associated with poorer psychosocial outcomes. These findings among a large cohort of patients provide insight into the impact of obesity during the cancer care trajectory and can provide guidance in the development and implementation of supportive care services for this ""at-risk"" population.""","""['Errol J Philip', 'Cristiane Decat Bergerot', 'Karen Clark', 'Paulo Bergerot', 'Matthew Loscalzo']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Psychooncology""","""['Evolving Information Needs among Colon, Breast, and Prostate Cancer Survivors: Results from a Longitudinal Mixed-Effects Analysis.', 'Coping Strategies Used by Breast, Prostate, and Colorectal Cancer Survivors: A Literature Review.', 'Determinants of patient activation in a community sample of breast and prostate cancer survivors.', 'Ability to Predict New-Onset Psychological Distress Using Routinely Collected Health Data: A Population-Based Cohort Study of Women Diagnosed With Breast Cancer.', 'Psychosocial interventions in breast cancer survivorship care.', 'Update on Prevalence of Pain in Patients with Cancer 2022: A Systematic Literature Review and Meta-Analysis.', 'Assessment of anxiety/depression among cancer patients before and during the COVID-19 pandemic.', 'Psychological distress in breast cancer patients during oncological inpatient rehabilitation: incidence, triggering factors and correlation with treatment-induced side effects.', 'Heterogeneity of posttraumatic stress, depression, and fear of cancer recurrence in breast cancer survivors: a latent class analysis.']"""

Such low availability of high-quality OHI persisted throughout different languages (English, French, Spanish) and common malignancy sites (breast, prostate, lung), with some variations between languages, malignancy sites, and RT vs CHT. Despite the important role of OHI in cancer patients' approach to health information gathering and decision-making, the availability of high-quality OHI for the AEs of common oncologic treatments, RT and CHT, is low across different languages and common malignancy sites.

Long non‑coding RNA metastasis associated with lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1 (MALAT1) has been reported to serve tumor‑promoting roles. However, the underlying mechanism requires further examination. In the present study, it was demonstrated that MALAT1 was increased while microRNA (miR/miRNA)‑1‑3p was decreased in prostate cancer cell lines. The silencing of MALAT1 inhibited migration, invasion and epithelial‑mesenchymal transition, when epithelial (E)‑cadherin expression level was increased, and neural (N)‑cadherin, vimentin, Slug and Snail expression levels were decreased. Dual‑luciferase reporter assay results demonstrated that miR‑1‑3p bound to MALAT1 and coronin 1C (CORO1C) 3' untranslated region, and MALAT1 competed with CORO1C for the binding sites of miR‑1‑3p. MALAT1 inhibited the expression of miR‑1‑3p and vice versa. MALAT1 knockdown induced the decline of CORO1C, which was subsequently recovered by the miR‑1‑3p inhibitor. In addition, by inhibiting miR‑1‑3p or overexpressing CORO1C, the silencing of MALAT1‑induced phenotypic alterations were restored. In conclusion, MALAT1 serving as a degradable miRNA sponge, may sequester miR‑1‑3p from CORO1C and by silencing MALAT1, migration, invasion and epithelial‑mesenchymal transition may be inhibited in prostate cancer cells. MALAT1 and CORO1C may serve as novel clinical therapeutic targets for prostate cancer.""","""['Xiaofan Dai', 'Zuowen Liang', 'Lingyun Liu', 'Kaimin Guo', 'Shengqi Xu', 'Hongliang Wang']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Mol Med Rep""","""['Suppression of long non-coding RNA MALAT1 inhibits survival and metastasis of esophagus cancer cells by sponging miR-1-3p/CORO1C/TPM3 axis.', 'Silencing of lncRNA MALAT1 inhibits cell cycle progression via androgen receptor signaling in prostate cancer cells.', 'YBX1 gene silencing inhibits migratory and invasive potential via CORO1C in breast cancer in vitro.', 'LncRNA MALAT1 promotes migration and invasion of non-small-cell lung cancer by targeting miR-206 and activating Akt/mTOR signaling.', 'Long Noncoding RNA MALAT1 Regulates Hepatocellular Carcinoma Growth Under Hypoxia via Sponging MicroRNA-200a.', 'The Role of Long Non-Coding RNAs in Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition-Related Signaling Pathways in Prostate Cancer.', 'Long non-coding RNA in prostate cancer.', 'Exosomes Derived from Tumor Cells Initiate Breast Cancer Cell Metastasis and Chemoresistance through a MALAT1-Dependent Mechanism.', 'The axis of long non-coding RNA MALAT1/miR-1-3p/CXCR4 is dysregulated in patients with diabetic neuropathy.', 'Crosstalk between Long Non Coding RNAs, microRNAs and DNA Damage Repair in Prostate Cancer: New Therapeutic Opportunities?']"""

Lipofectamine® 2000 was used to transfect HT‑29 cells to overexpress and knockdown KLK12.

The mRNA and protein expression levels of EMT‑associated proteins, apoptosis‑associated proteins, phosphorylated adenosine monophosphate‑activated protein kinase (p‑AMPK) and phosphorylated mammalian target of rapamycin (p‑mTOR) were determined by RT‑qPCR and western blot analysis. It was identified that the KLK12 mRNA levels were increased significantly in colorectal cancer tissues and cell lines. KLK12 small interfering RNA inhibited cell viability, migration and invasion. Furthermore, epithelial‑mesenchymal transition (EMT)‑associated proteins were altered by siKLK12. Cell apoptosis was induced by KLK12 downregulation, which was demonstrated by the changes in apoptosis‑associated proteins; however, KLK12 overexpression produced the opposite effect. SiKLK12 enhanced the expression of p‑AMPK and suppressed the expression of p‑mTOR, while KLK12 overexpression had the opposite effect. Promotion of KLK12 overexpression‑induced cell viability was reversed by 5‑aminoimidazole‑4‑carboxamide ribonucleotide, an activator of the AMPK signaling pathway, and rapamycin, a specific inhibitor of the mTOR signaling pathway.

To understand the effect of AR in cancer cells, we have treated LNCaP and LAPC4 cells, two immortalized human PCa cells in vitro, with the synthetic androgen R1881 and then performed RNA-seq analyses. High quality sequencing data have been analyzed using our bioinformatic pipeline which consists of FastQC for quality controls, Trimmomatic for trimming, and Kallisto for pseudoalignment to the transcriptome. Differentially expressed genes were identified using DESeq2 after adjustment for false-discovery rate (FDR q values < 0.05) and Relative Log Expression (RLE) normalization. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) was also performed to identify biological pathways significantly modulated by androgens. GSEA analyses identified the androgen signaling pathway, as well as several metabolic pathways, as significantly enriched following androgen stimulation. These analyses highlight the most significant metabolic pathways up-regulated following AR activation. Raw and processed RNA-seq data were deposited and made publicly available on the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO; GSE128749). These data have been incorporated in a recent article describing the functions of AR as a master regulator of PCa cell metabolism.

Extensive evidence exists that microRNAs (miRNAs or miRs) are key players in PCa and a new class of non-invasive cancer biomarkers. Materials and Methods: We performed miRNA profiling in plasma and tissues of PCa patients and attempted the validation of candidate individual miRs as biomarkers. Results: The comparison of tissue and plasma profiling results revealed five commonly dysregulated miRs, namely, miR-130a-3p, miR-145-5p, miR-148a-3p, miR-150-5p, and miR-365a-3p, of which only three show concordant changes-miR-130a-3p and miR-150-5p were downregulated and miR-148a-3p was upregulated in both tissue and plasma samples, respectively. MiR-150-5p was validated as significantly downregulated in both plasma and tissue cancer samples, with a fold change of -2.697 (p < 0.001), and -1.693 (p = 0.035), respectively. ROC analysis showed an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.817 (95% CI: 0.680-0.995) for plasma samples and 0.809 (95% CI: 0.616-1.001) for tissue samples. Conclusions: We provide data indicating that miR-150-5p plasma variations in PCa patients are associated with concordant changes in prostate cancer tissues; however, given the heterogeneous nature of previous findings of miR-150-5p expression in PCa cells, additional future studies of a larger sample size are warranted in order to confirm the biomarker potential and role of miRNA-150-5p in PCa biology.""","""['Ionut Andrei Paunescu', 'Razvan Bardan', 'Anca Marcu', 'Diana Nitusca', 'Alis Dema', 'Serban Negru', 'Ovidiu Balacescu', 'Loredana Balacescu', 'Alin Cumpanas', 'Ioan Ovidiu Sirbu', 'Bogdan Petrut', 'Edward Seclaman', 'Catalin Marian']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Medicina (Kaunas)""","""['Challenges in Cancer Biomarker Discovery Exemplified by the Identification of Diagnostic MicroRNAs in Prostate Tissues.', 'Plasma microRNAs as potential new biomarkers for early detection of early gastric cancer.', 'Potential plasma microRNAs signature miR-190b-5p, miR-215-5p and miR-527 as non-invasive biomarkers for prostate cancer.', 'Assessment of miR-98-5p, miR-152-3p, miR-326 and miR-4289 Expression as Biomarker for Prostate Cancer Diagnosis.', 'Role of Metastasis-Related microRNAs in Prostate Cancer Progression and Treatment.', 'Diagnosis of Prostate Cancer through the Multi-Ligand Binding of Prostate-Derived Extracellular Vesicles and miRNA Analysis.', 'Identification of Diagnostic Exosomal LncRNA-miRNA-mRNA Biomarkers in Colorectal Cancer Based on the ceRNA Network.', 'Role of miRNA-145, 148, and 185 and Stem Cells in Prostate Cancer.', 'MicroRNA panel in serum reveals novel diagnostic biomarkers for prostate cancer.', 'MiR-182-5p and miR-375-3p Have Higher Performance Than PSA in Discriminating Prostate Cancer from Benign Prostate Hyperplasia.']"""

Materials and methods:   Analyses focused on targeted biopsy of magnetic resonance imaging lesions suspicious for prostate cancer with a PI-RADS® (Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System) score of 3 or greater and consecutive radical prostatectomy. Descriptive statistics included the frequency/proportion and IQR. Multivariable logistic regression analyses on the per lesion level were used to predict the number of targeted biopsies with prostate cancer.  Results:   In the total cohort of 771 radical prostatectomy cases 437 (57%) and 334 (43%) were systematic transrectal ultrasound guided biopsy naïve or had 1 or more prior negative systematic transrectal ultrasound guided biopsies, respectively. A maximum PI-RADS score of 3, 4 and 5 was present in 67 (8.7%), 567 (74%) and 137 patients (18%), respectively. A total of 1,459 multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging lesions suspicious for prostate cancer were identified for analysis. Prostate cancer was detected based on an initial, second, third, or fourth or greater targeted biopsy in 79%, 92%, 98% and 100% of cases, respectively. The rate of prostate cancer detection on the first targeted biopsy core increased with higher PI-RADS scores of 3, 4 and 5 (67%, 79% and 87%, respectively). The number of prior negative systematic transrectal ultrasound guided biopsies and pathological tumor stage emerged as independent predictors on multivariate analysis, addressing the need for 2 or more targeted biopsy cores to detect clinically significant prostate cancer.  Conclusions:   Radical prostatectomy based analyses demonstrated that most cancers could be detected by 2 targeted biopsies only while in a minority of cases 3 or more targeted biopsies were necessary.

While the prognostic impact of these features is well studied, concordance with cribriform morphology and/or intraductal carcinoma on biopsy and prostatectomy has only recently gained attention. Our primary objective was to evaluate the diagnostic performance of biopsy to detect cribriform morphology and/or intraductal carcinoma in paired biopsy and prostatectomy specimens in a large contemporary cohort.  Materials and methods:   Patients who underwent prostate biopsy or had biopsies reviewed prior to prostatectomy at a tertiary hospital between November 2017 and November 2018 were included in study. Sensitivity and specificity were calculated to assess concordance with cribriform morphology and/or intraductal carcinoma on biopsy and prostatectomy. The association of biopsy diagnosed with cribriform morphology and/or intraductal carcinoma with adverse pathology was assessed by multivariable regression.  Results:   Of the 455 men who underwent prostatectomy 216 (47.5%) had biopsy identified with cribriform morphology and/or intraductal carcinoma. For cribriform morphology and/or intraductal carcinoma the sensitivity and specificity of biopsy was 56.5% and 87.2%, respectively. In men eligible for active surveillance sensitivity was 34.1% and specificity was 88.1%. Magnetic resonance imaging targeted biopsies did not improve sensitivity (53.5%). Cribriform morphology and/or intraductal carcinoma identified on prostatectomy correlated with adverse pathological findings. However, compared to cribriform morphology and/or intraductal carcinoma negative biopsies, biopsies identified with cribriform morphology and/or intraductal carcinoma were not independently associated with adverse pathology. This was likely due to biopsy low sensitivity.  Conclusions:   In this cohort biopsy was not sensitive for detecting cribriform morphology and/or intraductal carcinoma and this was not improved by magnetic resonance imaging fusion. However, specificity was high, suggesting that when present on biopsy, cribriform morphology and/or intraductal carcinoma may be considered in treatment planning algorithms.""","""['Kyle J Ericson', 'Shannon S Wu', 'Scott D Lundy', 'Lewis J Thomas', 'Eric A Klein', 'Jesse K McKenney']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""J Urol""","""['Editorial Comment.', 'Editorial Comment.', 'Role of Magnetic Resonance Imaging Targeted Biopsy in Detection of Prostate Cancer Harboring Adverse Pathological Features of Intraductal Carcinoma and Invasive Cribriform Carcinoma.', 'Prevalence of adverse pathology features in grade group 2 prostatectomy specimens with syn- or metachronous metastatic disease.', 'Concordance of biopsy and prostatectomy diagnosis of intraductal and cribriform carcinoma in a prospectively collected data set.', 'Prostate cancer with cribriform morphology: diagnosis, aggressiveness, molecular pathology and possible relationships with intraductal carcinoma.', 'Contemporary Gleason Grading of Prostatic Carcinoma: An Update With Discussion on Practical Issues to Implement the 2014 International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) Consensus Conference on Gleason Grading of Prostatic Carcinoma.', 'Is cribriform pattern in prostate biopsy a risk factor for metastatic disease on 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT?', 'Single cell analysis of cribriform prostate cancer reveals cell intrinsic and tumor microenvironmental pathways of aggressive disease.', 'Oncological outcomes of cribriform histology pattern in prostate cancer patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Percentage Gleason pattern 4 and PI-RADS score predict upgrading in biopsy Grade Group 2 prostate cancer patients without cribriform pattern.', 'Current conundrums with cribriform prostate cancer.']"""

An additional safety margin is needed to include this intersubject variability. In this work, we present a deep learning-based method for image-based subject-specific local SAR assessment. We propose to train a convolutional neural network to learn a ""surrogate SAR model"" to map the relation between subject-specific B1+ maps and the corresponding local SAR.  Method:   Our database of 23 subject-specific models with an 8-transmit channel body array for prostate imaging at 7 T was used to build 5750 training samples. These synthetic complex B1+ maps and local SAR distributions were used to train a conditional generative adversarial network. Extra penalization for local SAR underestimation errors was included in the loss function. In silico and in vivo validation were performed.  Results:   In silico cross-validation shows a good qualitative and quantitative match between predicted and ground-truth local SAR distributions. The peak local SAR estimation error distribution shows a mean overestimation error of 15% with 13% probability of underestimation. The higher accuracy of the proposed method allows the use of less conservative safety factors compared with standard procedures. In vivo validation shows that the method is applicable with realistic measurement data with impressively good qualitative and quantitative agreement to simulations.  Conclusion:   The proposed deep learning method allows online image-based subject-specific local SAR assessment. It greatly reduces the uncertainty in current state-of-the-art SAR assessment methods, reducing the time in the examination protocol by almost 25%.""","""['E F Meliadò', 'A J E Raaijmakers', 'A Sbrizzi', 'B R Steensma', 'M Maspero', 'M H F Savenije', 'P R Luijten', 'C A T van den Berg']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Magn Reson Med""","""['Personalized local SAR prediction for parallel transmit neuroimaging at 7T from a single T1-weighted dataset.', 'Intersubject specific absorption rate variability analysis through construction of 23 realistic body models for prostate imaging at 7T.', 'Conditional safety margins for less conservative peak local SAR assessment: A probabilistic approach.', 'Current applications of deep-learning in neuro-oncological MRI.', 'Enhancing scientific discoveries in molecular biology with deep generative models.', 'Bench to bore ramifications of inter-subject head differences on RF shimming and specific absorption rates at 7T.', 'Ultra-high-field MR in Prostate cancer: Feasibility and Potential.', 'Personalized local SAR prediction for parallel transmit neuroimaging at 7T from a single T1-weighted dataset.', 'Progress in Understanding Radiofrequency Heating and Burn Injuries for Safer MR Imaging.', 'B1 field map synthesis with generative deep learning used in the design of parallel-transmit RF pulses for ultra-high field MRI.']"""

Methods:   PROCEED enrolled patients with mCRPC receiving 3 biweekly sipuleucel-T infusions. Assessments included overall survival (OS), serious adverse events (SAEs), cerebrovascular events (CVEs), and anticancer interventions (ACIs). Follow-up was for ≥3 years or until death or study withdrawal.  Results:   In 2011-2017, 1976 patients were followed for 46.6 months (median). The median age was 72 years, and the baseline median prostate-specific antigen level was 15.0 ng/mL; 86.7% were white, and 11.6% were African American. Among the patients, 1902 had 1 or more sipuleucel-T infusions. The median OS was 30.7 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 28.6-32.2 months).

However, whether downgrading or upgrading from needle biopsy (NB) to radical prostatectomy (RP) affects oncologic outcomes is currently unknown. Herein, we investigated the prognostic impact of downgrading and upgrading from NB to RP among men with GS 7 PC.  Methods:   We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 3003 patients with localized PC who underwent RP between 2005 and 2014. We included 692 patients with GS 7 PC on both NB and RP specimens. We analyzed the data using Kaplan-Meier methods and Cox proportional hazard models.  Results:   Of the 692 patients enrolled in this study, 389 (56.2%) and 303 (43.8%) patients had RP GS 3 + 4 = 7 and RP GS 4 + 3 = 7 PC, respectively.

The high affinity GRPr antagonist RM2 can be labeled with beta-emitting radiometals for therapeutic purposes. The aim of this study was to calculate absorbed doses for critical organs and tumor lesions for [177Lu]Lu-RM2 therapy administered in a group of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) patients who had insufficient PSMA expression or showed lower PSMA accumulation after previous cycles of [177Lu]Lu-PSMA-617 therapy.  Methods:   Thirty-five patients suffering from mCRPC without further treatment options for approved therapies were examined with [68Ga]Ga-RM2-PET/CT. Out of these, 4 patients (mean age 68 years) were treated with [177Lu]Lu-RM2; two of these also received a 2nd therapy cycle. Mean activity was 4.5 ± 0.9 GBq. For dosimetry, patients underwent planar WB-scintigraphy and SPECT/CT imaging of the upper and lower abdomen at approximately 1, 24, 48, and 72 h p.i. along with blood sampling. Absorbed doses for kidneys, pancreas, liver, spleen, gallbladder wall, and tumor lesions were derived based on quantitative SPECT/CT according to RADAR dosimetry scheme; individual organ masses were extracted from CT. Absorbed dose to bone marrow was calculated based on serial whole-body images and blood sampling according to the EANM guideline.  Results:   Therapy was well tolerated by all patients and no side effects were observed. An increased uptake in tumor lesions and the pancreas was seen within the first 1 h. Mean absorbed organ doses were 1.08 ± 0.44 Gy/GBq in the pancreas, 0.35 ± 0.14 Gy/GBq in the kidneys, 0.05 ± 0.02 Gy/GBq in the liver, 0.07 ± 0.02 Gy/GBq in the gallbladder wall, 0.10 ± 0.06 Gy/GBq in the spleen, and 0.02 ± 0.01 Gy/GBq for the red bone marrow. The mean dose for tumor lesions was 6.20 ± 3.00 Gy/GBq.  Conclusions:   Application of GRPr antagonist [177Lu]Lu-RM2 is suitable for targeted radiotherapy of mCRPC as it shows high tumor uptake and rapid clearance from normal organs. Absorbed doses in tumor lesions are therapeutically relevant. The critical organ receiving the highest absorbed dose was the pancreas.

Procedures:   A total of 93 patients with biochemically recurrent prostate cancer underwent [68Ga]PSMA-11 PET/CT and subsequently a whole-body integrated PET/MRI examination. Board certified nuclear medicine physicians and radiologists evaluated PET/CT and PET/MRI datasets regarding identification of tumor lesions ((i) lymph nodes, (ii) bone lesions, (iii) local recurrence, and (iv) parenchymal lesions) based on maximum [68Ga]PSMA-11 uptake as well as morphological changes. Quality of PET images for both PET/CT and PET/MRI were rated using a 5-point scoring system by evaluating lesion homogeneity, contrast, contour, and delineation. Wilcoxon signed-rank tests were used to determine statistical differences.  Results:   PC relapse was detected in 62/93 patients. PET/MRI detected 148 out of 150 lesions described in PET/CT. In addition, PET/MRI detected 11 lesions not detected in PET/CT (5 lymph nodes, 6 local recurrences). The exact McNemar statistical test (one-sided) showed significant difference between PET/CT and PET/MRI for diagnosis of local recurrence (p value = 0.031). Diagnostic confidence for (iii) was higher in PET/MRI compared with PET/CT (PET/CT = 1.1; PET/MRI = 4.9).

Methods:   At our institute 38 breast, 47 cervical and 50 prostate cancer patients treated with image-guided interstitial high-dose-rate BT were selected. Treatment plans were created using HIPO and IPSA inverse optimisation methods as well as FO. The dose-volume parameters of different treatment plans were compared with Friedman ANOVA and the LSD post-hoc test.  Results:   IPSA creates less dose coverage to the target volume than HIPO or FO: V100 was 91.7%, 91% and 91.9% for HIPO, IPSA and FO plans (p = 0.1784) in breast BT; 90.4%, 89.2% and 91% (p = 0.0045) in cervical BT; and 97.1%, 96.2% and 97.7% (p = 0.0005) in prostate BT, respectively.

In breast BT, dose to the skin and lung was smaller with HIPO and FO than with IPSA. In cervical BT, dose to the rectum, sigmoid and bowel was larger using IPSA than with HIPO or FO. In prostate BT, dose to the urethra was higher and the rectal dose was smaller using FO than with inverse methods.  Conclusion:   In interstitial breast and prostate BT, HIPO results in comparable dose-volume parameters to FO, but HIPO plans are more conformal. In cervical BT, HIPO produces dosimetrically acceptable plans only when more needles are used.

However, localizing BCR with prostate-specific membrane antigen PET/CT remains challenging in patients with low prostate-specific antigen (PSA) values. Here, we studied the impact of advanced PET image reconstruction methods on BCR localization and interobserver agreement with 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT scans in patients with BCR and low PSA values. Methods: Twenty-four patients with BCR and a PSA level of less than 2.0 ng/mL were included. PET images were reconstructed with 4-mm voxels and 2-mm voxels, both with and without point-spread function. All scans were interpreted by 4 nuclear medicine physicians. Additionally, PET examinations of 5 patients with primary prostate cancer and confirmed absence of lymph node metastases (after lymph node dissection) were included, to assess the risk of introducing false-positive findings when using advanced reconstruction. Calculation of BCR localization rates (scan positivity) was based on consensus among our readers (≥3 readers regarding a scan positive for BCR), as well as the individual scan interpretations of the readers. Results: In the consensus analysis, BCR localization rates were not higher using advanced reconstruction (62.5%-66.7%) than using 4-mm reconstruction (62.5%). On the basis of individual readings, however, more scans were positive using 2-mm reconstruction (74.0%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 65.0%-82.9%) (P = 0.027) and 2-mm reconstruction with point-spread function (75.0%; 95% CI, 66.2%-83.8%) (P = 0.014) than 4-mm reconstruction (65.6%; 95% CI, 56.0%-75.3%). A higher number of lesions was detected on the 2-mm scans (median, 2 lesions; interquartile range, 1-3) than the 4-mm scans (median, 1; interquartile range, 0-3; P = 0.008). The advanced reconstruction methods did not increase interobserver agreement (80.6%-84.7%), compared with the 4-mm scans (75.7%, P = 0.08-0.25). In the patients with primary prostate cancer, an equal number of false-positive lesions was observed among the different reconstruction methods (overall, n = 13). Conclusion: Applying advanced image reconstruction for 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT scans did not increase BCR localization in patients with BCR and low PSA values (reader consensus). Yet, the increased number of positive individual readings may imply that further development of image reconstruction methods holds potential to improve BCR localization. No improved interobserver agreement was observed with advanced reconstruction compared with standard 4-mm reconstruction.""","""['Bernard H E Jansen', 'Robin W Jansen', 'Maurits Wondergem', 'Sandra Srbljin', 'John M H de Klerk', 'Birgit I Lissenberg-Witte', 'André N Vis', 'Reindert J A van Moorselaar', 'Ronald Boellaard', 'Otto S Hoekstra', 'Daniela E Oprea-Lager']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""J Nucl Med""","""['Early lesion detection with 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT in 248 patients with biochemically recurrent prostate cancer.', 'Prospective Evaluation of 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT in Biochemically Recurrent Prostate Cancer in an Academic Center: A Focus on Disease Localization and Changes in Management.', 'Clinical verification of 18F-DCFPyL PET-detected lesions in patients with biochemically recurrent prostate cancer.', 'More advantages in detecting bone and soft tissue metastases from prostate cancer using 18F-PSMA PET/CT.', 'Detection Rate of 18F-Labeled PSMA PET/CT in Biochemical Recurrent Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Review and a Meta-Analysis.', 'Influences on PET Quantification and Interpretation.', 'Moving the goalposts while scoring-the dilemma posed by new PET technologies.', 'Performance of 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT Imaging in Early Detection of Biochemically Recurrent Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.', 'Repeatability of Quantitative 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT Measurements in Metastatic Prostate Cancer.']"""

Methods:18F-NaF PET/CT scans were retrieved from all patients who participated in 4 recent prospective trials. Two experienced observers independently evaluated the 18F-NaF PET/CT scans on a patient level using a 3-category scale (no bone metastases [M0], equivocal for bone metastases, and bone metastases present [M1]) and on a dichotomous scale (M0/M1). In patients with no more than 10 lesions, the location and number of lesions were recorded. On a patient level, the diagnostic performance was calculated using a sensitivity analysis, in which equivocal lesions were handled as M0 as well as M1. Results:18F-NaF PET/CT scans from 219 patients with PCa were included, of whom 129 patients were scanned for primary staging, 67 for biochemical recurrence, and 23 for metastatic castration-resistant PCa. Agreement between the observers was almost perfect on a patient level (3-category unweighted κ = 0.83 ± 0.05, linear weighted κ = 0.90 ± 0.06, and dichotomous κ = 0.91 ± 0.07). On a lesion level (dichotomous scale), the observers agreed on the number and location of bone metastases in 205 (93.6%) patients. In the remaining 14 patients, the readers disagreed on the number of lesions in 13 patients and the location of bone metastases in 1 patient. A final diagnosis of bone metastases was made for 211 of 219 patients. The sensitivity ranged from 0.86 to 0.92, specificity from 0.83 to 0.97, positive predictive value from 0.70 to 0.93, and negative predictive value from 0.94 to 0.96. Conclusion: The interobserver agreement on 18F-NaF PET/CT for the detection of bone metastases in patients with PCa was very high among trained observers, both on a patient level and on a lesion level.

The purpose of this study was to develop a second-generation 99mTc-labeled PSMA-targeted tracer incorporating a fluorescent dye. Methods: Several PSMA-targeted hybrid tracers were synthesized: glutamic acid-urea-lysine (EuK)-Cy5-mas3, EuK-(SO3)Cy5-mas3, EuK-Cy5(SO3)-mas3, EuK-(Ar)Cy5-mas3, and EuK-Cy5(Ar)-mas3; the Cy5 dye acts as a functional backbone between the EuK targeting vector and the 2-mercaptoacetyl-seryl-seryl-seryl (mas3) chelate to study the dye's interaction with PSMA's amphipathic entrance funnel. The compounds were evaluated for their photophysical and chemical properties and PSMA affinity. After radiolabeling with 99mTc, we performed in vivo SPECT imaging, biodistribution, and fluorescence imaging on BALB/c nude mice with orthotopically transplanted PC346C tumors. Results: The dye composition influenced the photophysical properties (brightness range 0.3-1.5 × 104 M-1 × cm-1), plasma protein interactions (range 85.0% ± 2.3%-90.7% ± 1.3% bound to serum, range 76% ± 0%-89% ± 6% stability in serum), PSMA affinity (half-maximal inhibitory concentration [IC50] range 19.2 ± 5.8-175.3 ± 61.1 nM) and in vivo characteristics (tumor-to-prostate and tumor-to-muscle ratios range 0.02 ± 0.00-154.73 ± 28.48 and 0.46 ± 0.28-5,157.50 ± 949.17, respectively; renal, splenic, and salivary retention). Even though all tracer analogs allowed tumor identification with SPECT and fluorescence imaging, 99mTc-EuK-(SO3)Cy5-mas3 had the most promising properties (e.g., half-maximal inhibitory concentration, 19.2 ± 5.8, tumor-to-muscle ratio, 5,157.50 ± 949.17). Conclusion: Our findings demonstrate the intrinsic integration of a fluorophore in the pharmacophore in PSMA-targeted small-molecule tracers.

LncRNA NEAT1 functions as an oncogene in many cancers. However, the roles of NEAT1 in prostate cancer (PCa) remain largely unknown. In the present study, we aim to explore the molecular mechanism of NEAT1 in the development of PCa. We detected the expression levels of NEAT1 in a total of 16 benign prostatic hyperplasia tissues (BPH), 30 matched adjacent healthy control (HC) tissues and 30 PCa tissues, as well as PCa cell lines PC-3, DU-145, LNCaP and normal prostate epithelial cell line RWPE-1. The results showed that NEAT1 was significantly up-regulated in PCa tissues and PCa cell lines. Knockdown of NEAT1 can largely inhibit DU-145 and PC-3 cell growth and invasion. Bioinformatics analysis predicted NEAT1 has the binding site of miR-98-5p which can bind to the 3'UTR of HMGA2. And the expression level of NEAT1 has a positive correlation with HMAG2, while negative correlation with miR-98-5p in PCa cells. In addition, luciference assay and RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) assay confirmed that NEAT1 can function as a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) by sponging miR-98-5p to active HMGA2. Moreover, silencing of HMGA2 can decrease the proliferation ability of PCa cells. Taken together, NEAT1/miR-98-5p/HMGA2 pathway is involved in the development and progression of PCa. NEAT1 could be recommended as a prognostic biomarker and inhibition of NEAT1 expression may be a promising strategy for PCa therapy.""","""['Zhuifeng Guo', 'Chang He', 'Fan Yang', 'Liang Qin', 'Xuwei Lu', 'Jiawen Wu']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Biosci Rep""","""['LncRNA UCA1 acts as a sponge of miR-204 to up-regulate CXCR4 expression and promote prostate cancer progression.', 'LncRNA NEAT1 promotes docetaxel resistance in prostate cancer by regulating ACSL4 via sponging miR-34a-5p and miR-204-5p.', 'Long non-coding RNA HOTTIP promotes prostate cancer cells proliferation and migration by sponging miR-216a-5p.', 'Roles and mechanisms of miR-195-5p in human solid cancers.', 'An updated review of contribution of long noncoding RNA-NEAT1 to the progression of human cancers.', 'Long Intergenic Nonprotein Coding RNA 00174 Aggravates Lung Squamous Cell Carcinoma Progression via MicroRNA-185-5p/Nuclear Factor IX axis.', 'Molecular Interactions of the Long Noncoding RNA NEAT1 in Cancer.', 'Recent advances of NEAT1-miRNA interactions in cancer.', 'Crosstalk between Long Non Coding RNAs, microRNAs and DNA Damage Repair in Prostate Cancer: New Therapeutic Opportunities?', 'Identification of Novel Diagnostic Biomarkers in Prostate Adenocarcinoma Based on the Stromal-Immune Score and Analysis of the WGCNA and ceRNA Network.']"""

It is important to develop next-generation mechanistically distinct drugs to treat castration- and drug-resistant prostate cancers.  Experimental design:   Second-generation AR pan antagonist UT-34 was selected from a library of compounds and tested in competitive AR binding and transactivation assays. UT-34 was tested using biophysical methods for binding to the AR activation function-1 (AF-1) domain. Western blot, gene expression, and proliferation assays were performed in various AR-positive enzalutamide-sensitive and -resistant prostate cancer cell lines. Pharmacokinetic and xenograft studies were performed in immunocompromised rats and mice.  Results:   UT-34 inhibits the wild-type and LBD-mutant ARs comparably and inhibits the in vitro proliferation and in vivo growth of enzalutamide-sensitive and -resistant prostate cancer xenografts. In preclinical models, UT-34 induced the regression of enzalutamide-resistant tumors at doses when the AR is degraded; but, at lower doses, when the AR is just antagonized, it inhibits, without shrinking, the tumors. This indicates that degradation might be a prerequisite for tumor regression. Mechanistically, UT-34 promotes a conformation that is distinct from the LBD-binding competitive antagonist enzalutamide and degrades the AR through the ubiquitin proteasome mechanism. UT-34 has a broad safety margin and exhibits no cross-reactivity with G-protein-coupled receptor kinase and nuclear receptor family members.

Therefore, inferring the potential lncRNA-disease associations are helpful for understanding the molecular pathogenesis of diseases. Most previous methods have concentrated on the construction of shallow learning models in order to predict lncRNA-disease associations, while they have failed to deeply integrate heterogeneous multi-source data and to learn the low-dimensional feature representations from these data. We propose a method based on the convolutional neural network with the attention mechanism and convolutional autoencoder for predicting candidate disease-related lncRNAs, and refer to it as CNNDLP. CNNDLP integrates multiple kinds of data from heterogeneous sources, including the associations, interactions, and similarities related to the lncRNAs, diseases, and miRNAs. Two different embedding layers are established by combining the diverse biological premises about the cases that the lncRNAs are likely to associate with the diseases. We construct a novel prediction model based on the convolutional neural network with attention mechanism and convolutional autoencoder to learn the attention and the low-dimensional network representations of the lncRNA-disease pairs from the embedding layers. The different adjacent edges among the lncRNA, miRNA, and disease nodes have different contributions for association prediction. Hence, an attention mechanism at the adjacent edge level is established, and the left side of the model learns the attention representation of a pair of lncRNA and disease. A new type of lncRNA similarity and a new type of disease similarity are calculated by incorporating the topological structures of multiple bipartite networks. The low-dimensional network representation of the lncRNA-disease pairs is further learned by the autoencoder based convolutional neutral network on the right side of the model. The cross-validation experimental results confirm that CNNDLP has superior prediction performance compared to the state-of-the-art methods. Case studies on stomach cancer, breast cancer, and prostate cancer further show the ability of CNNDLP for discovering the potential disease lncRNAs.""","""['Ping Xuan', 'Nan Sheng', 'Tiangang Zhang', 'Yong Liu', 'Yahong Guo']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Int J Mol Sci""","""['Graph Convolutional Network and Convolutional Neural Network Based Method for Predicting lncRNA-Disease Associations.', 'LDAPred: A Method Based on Information Flow Propagation and a Convolutional Neural Network for the Prediction of Disease-Associated lncRNAs.', 'Dual Convolutional Neural Networks With Attention Mechanisms Based Method for Predicting Disease-Related lncRNA Genes.', 'Long non-coding RNAs and complex diseases: from experimental results to computational models.', 'Computational models for lncRNA function prediction and functional similarity calculation.', 'Geometric complement heterogeneous information and random forest for predicting lncRNA-disease associations.', 'Integration of Neighbor Topologies Based on Meta-Paths and Node Attributes for Predicting Drug-Related Diseases.', 'Emerging Roles and Mechanisms of lncRNA FOXD3-AS1 in Human Diseases.', 'Inferring Latent Disease-lncRNA Associations by Label-Propagation Algorithm and Random Projection on a Heterogeneous Network.', 'gGATLDA: lncRNA-disease association prediction based on graph-level graph attention network.']"""

However, the role of EVs in the inflammatory cross-talk between cancer cells and microenvironment-residing cells remains largely unknown. To evaluate the role of EVs in the tumour microenvironment, we treated the non-cancerous prostate cell line PNT2 with EVs isolated from advanced-stage prostate cancer PC3 (PC3-EVs). Caspase-1-mediated IL-1β maturation was evaluated after 24 h incubation with EVs. Moreover, the effect of PC3-EVs on differentiated macrophagic THP-1 cells was assessed by analyzing cytokine expression and PC3 cells migration and proliferation profiles. We illustrated that PC3 cells contain active NLRP3-inflammasome cascade and secrete IL-1β. PC3-EVs affect the PNT2 inflammatory response, inducing caspase-1-mediated IL-1β maturation via ERK1/2-mediated lysosomal destabilization and cathepsin B activation. We also verified that PC3-EVs induce a functional TAM-like polarization in differentiated THP-1 cells. Our results demonstrated that cancer-derived EVs induce an inflammatory response in non-cancerous prostate cells, while inducing an immunomodulatory phenotype in immune cells.

Aromatase catalyzes estrogen from androgens, yet the role of aromatase-generated endogenous estrogen in CRPC is poorly understood. In this study, we assessed the expression and function of aromatase in CRPC. We found that aromatase expression was significantly increased in CRPC tissues and cell lines. In some prostate cancer cell lines, aromatase was predominantly expressed in CD44+ subsets. Bicalutamide treatment significantly increased aromatase expression, and CYP19A1 expression positively correlated with estrogen responses and epithelial-mesenchymal transition. Aromatase knockdown in PC3 cells reduced invasiveness and decreased metastasis-related gene expression. The aromatase inhibitor, letrozole, attenuated tumour metastasis in castrated PC3-xenograft mice. Mechanistically, aromatase-induced endogenous estrogen promoted estrogen receptor-α (ERα) binding to matrix metalloproteinase 12 (MMP12) promoter estrogen response element (ERE). MMP12 co-localized with CD44 on the cell membrane and MMP12 knockdown significantly reduced estradiol-induced PC3 invasion.

LTF may also act as a tumor suppressor with antiproliferative action. LTF is inactivated genetically or epigenetically in various cancers, and a CpG island spanning the transcriptional start site of LTF is hypermethylated in prostate cancer cell lines. We, therefore, hypothesized that LTF expression is silenced via CpG island hypermethylation in the early stages of prostate tumorigenesis carcinogenesis. Targeted methylation analysis was performed using a combination of methylated-DNA precipitation and methylation-sensitive restriction enzymes, and laser-capture microdissection followed by bisulfite sequencing on DNA isolated from prostate tissue samples, including both primary and metastatic disease. LTF mRNA in situ hybridization and LTF protein immunohistochemistry were also performed. We report that the LTF CpG island is frequently and densely methylated in high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia, primary prostate carcinoma, and metastases. We further report a decoupling of lactoferrin mRNA and protein expression, including in lesions where LTF mRNA has presumably been silenced via CpG island methylation. We conclude that LTF mRNA expression is silenced in prostate tumorigenesis via hypermethylation, supporting a role for LTF as a prostate cancer tumor suppressor gene. Likewise, the frequency at which the LTF CpG island is methylated across samples suggests it is an important and conserved step in prostate cancer initiation.""","""['Corey M Porter', 'Michael C Haffner', 'Ibrahim Kulac', 'Janielle P Maynard', 'Javier A Baena-Del Valle', 'William B Isaacs', 'Srinivasan Yegnasubramanian', 'Angelo M De Marzo', 'Karen S Sfanos']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Am J Pathol""","""['Genomic hypomethylation and CpG island hypermethylation in prostatic intraepithelial neoplasm.', 'Aberrant CpG island hypermethylation of multiple genes in prostate cancer and prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia.', 'DNA methylation paradigm shift: 15-lipoxygenase-1 upregulation in prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia and prostate cancer by atypical promoter hypermethylation.', 'GSTP1 CpG island hypermethylation as a molecular biomarker for prostate cancer.', 'Molecular biomarker in prostate cancer: the role of CpG island hypermethylation.', 'Expression Profiles of CDKN2A, MDM2, E2F2 and LTF Genes in Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma.', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism and mRNA Expression of LTF in Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma.', 'Health inequity drives disease biology to create disparities in prostate cancer outcomes.', 'Reciprocal YAP1 loss and INSM1 expression in neuroendocrine prostate cancer.', 'Identification and validation of an immune-related prognostic signature and key gene in papillary thyroid carcinoma.']"""

This inconsistency maybe due, in part, to the small sample sizes from previous studies and an incomplete assessment of comorbidities, particularly diabetes.  Objective:   We investigated the association of PCa with TTh (injection or gel) and different TTh doses and determined whether this association varies by the presence of diabetes at baseline in a large, nationally representative, commercially insured cohort.  Design:   We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 189 491 men aged 40-60 years old in the IBM MarketScan® Commercial Database, which included 1424 PCa cases diagnosed from 2011 to 2014. TTh was defined using CPT codes from inpatient and outpatient, and NDC codes from pharmacy claims. Multivariable adjusted Cox proportional hazards models were used to compute hazard ratios for patients with incident PCa.  Results:   We found a 33% reduced association of PCa after comparing the highest category (>12) of TTh injections with the lowest (1-2 injections) category (HR = 0.67, 95% CI: 0.54-0.82). Similar statistical significant inverse association for PCa was observed for men who received TTh topical gels (>330 vs 1- to 60-days supply). Among nondiabetics, we found significant inverse association between TTh (injection and gel) and PCa, but a weak interaction between TTh injections and diabetes (P = .05).

NKX3.1 and prostein (P501S) are antibodies highly specific for prostate origin. Relatively little is known of the expression of these markers in testicular tissue. We investigated the expression of NKX3.1 and P501S in testicular tissues, sex cord-stromal tumors, germ cell tumors, and rete testis adenocarcinoma. We found strong diffuse nuclear staining for NKX3.1 in Sertoli cells of the testis. Expression of NKX3.1 was seen in 0/3 ovarian Sertoli cell tumors, 1/4 testicular Sertoli cell tumors, and in the Sertoli cell component of 1/12 ovarian Sertoli-Leydig cell tumors. We found moderate, diffuse cytoplasmic positivity for P501S in rete testis epithelium and in testicular Leydig cells. P501S also highlighted Leydig cells in 9/12 Sertoli-Leydig cell tumors of the ovary. Two of 3 Leydig cell tumors of the testis showed weak to moderate, diffuse cytoplasmic staining for P501S. All cases of embryonal carcinoma and pure seminoma were negative for both NKX3.1 and P501S. One case of rete testis adenocarcinoma showed patchy positivity for both NKX3.1 and P501S.

Methods:   This is a two-site phase 1b Department of Defense Prostate Cancer Clinical Trials Consortium trial of docetaxel, prednisone, and pazopanib once daily and ongoing androgen deprivation therapy and prophylactic pegfilgrastim in men with mCRPC. The primary endpoint was safety and the determination of a maximum tolerated dose (MTD) through a dose-escalation and expansion design; secondary endpoints included progression-free and overall survival (OS), prostate specific antigen (PSA) declines, radiographic responses, and pharmacokinetic and plasma angiokine biomarker analyses.  Results:   Twenty-five men were treated over six dose levels. Pegfilgrastim was added to the regimen after myelosuppression limited dose escalation. With pegfilgrastim, our target MTD of docetaxel 75 mg/m2 q3 weeks; prednisone 10 mg daily; and pazopanib 800 mg daily was reached. Eleven additional patients were accrued at this dose level for a total of 36 patients. Dose-limiting toxicities included neutropenia, syncope, and hypertension. Three deaths attributed to study treatment occurred.

The objective of this study is to evaluate the association between FH and PCa in a Chinese biopsy cohort.  Methods:   Consecutive patients who received 10 to 12 core systematic prostate biopsies from April 2013 to October 2018 in three medical centers were enrolled in this study. Demographic information and clinical information were obtained through prebiopsy questionnaire, including cancer FH, age, and total prostate-specific antigen (tPSA).  Results:   Of 2321 patients, 83 (3.6%) were reported a FH of PCa. The positive biopsy rate in these patients was 54.2%, significantly higher than the patients without the family history of PCa (42.6%; relative risk [RR] = 1.27; P = .024). In patients with positive FH of breast cancer gene (BRCA)-related cancers (breast, ovarian, and prostate cancer, n = 154), 74 (48.1%) were diagnosed as PCa, higher than those without FH (42.7%; RR = 1.13; P = .112). Multivariate logistic regression analysis (after adjusting for age and tPSA values) showed that there was 2.1-fold increased risk of PCa in patients with positive FH of PCa (P = .005), and 1.6-fold increased risk in patients with positive FH of BRCA-related cancers (P = .019). However, there was no significant association between FH of PCa or BRCA-related cancer and high-grade PCa after adjusting age and tPSA level (P = .404 for PCa, P = 0.991 for BRCA-related cancers).

However, little attention has been focused on the relationship between SPAG9 and PCa. SPAG9 protein level was measured by immunohistochemical staining in the PCa tissues. SPAG9 mRNA and protein expression were investigated in various PCa cells by qRT-PCR and Western blot. Depletion and overexpression of SPAG9 were proceeded in PCa cells to evaluate their effects by various malignant approaches in vitro and in vivo. SPAG9 was significantly upregulated in the PCa tissues, mainly expressed in the cytoplasm and occasionally in the nucleus of some cells, while SPAG9 was not detected in normal prostate tissue. SPAG9 protein was detected in three PCa cells. Furthermore, these results revealed that upregulation of SPAG9 could promote cell proliferation, migration, motility and cycle of PC-3 cell line, vice versa, downregulation of SPAG9 resulted in the opposite effect. In vivo, knockout of SPAG9 expression induced suppression of tumor growth in athymic nude mice. In summary, the present study indicated that SPAG9 was closely related to the Gleason scores of PCa.

Eukaryotic Translation Initiation Factor 4 Gamma 1 (EIF4G1) serves as a scaffold for assembly of cap-dependent translation components in EIF4F complex formation. In the current study, we analyzed the role and expression of EIF4G1 in Pan human cancer panels through various approaches.  Methods:   Immunohistochemistry analysis of EIF4G1 protein was done on high-density multi-organ Human Cancer tissue microarray (TMA) derived from the patient samples from different cancers. We used multiple clinical cohorts to analyze the EIF4G1 mRNA expression across human cancers. TCGA data analysis of EIF4G1 was done through Ualcan and c-bioportal web servers. Western blots for EIF4G1 protein was done for different cell lines in representing the multiple cancer types. Dependency score was calculated through Cancer Dependency Map. Clonogenic, tumorosphere assay and cell invasion assay were done with EIF4G complex inhibitor. Association of EIF4G1 mRNA and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was done on available TCGA datasets.  Results:   We observed an increase in EIF4G1 protein levels in tissue sections from different cancers as compared to their respective normal tissue. Our analysis of the TCGA data revealed that EIF4G1 mRNA expression is significantly increased in tumor tissues compared to respective control tissues across human cancers and variable expression was observed among different datasets. We discovered that alteration frequency in EIF4G1 is prevalent in human cancers e.g. prostate cancer (~ 25%), ovarian cancer (~ 15%), Head and Neck cancer (~ 13%) and cervical cancer (~ 12.5%). EIF4G1 mRNA and protein levels were high across cancer cell lines from multiple organs. Our analysis of DepMap datasets utilizing depletion assays revealed that EIF4G1 is critical for cancer cell survival.

Work impacts of caregiving, financial burden, and psychosocial outcomes of caregivers are not well understood.  Methods:   Results include information from surveys completed by 202 employed caregivers of participants in the Detroit Research on Cancer Survivors cohort, a population-based cohort of African American survivors of breast, colorectal, lung, or prostate cancer. Relationships between work outcomes, financial burden, and anxiety and depression were assessed using logistic regression models controlling for demographic and cancer-related factors.  Results:   Most (73.8%) caregivers made some employment change. Sixty percent changed their schedule, hours, duties, or employment status; 15.3% took at least 1 month off to provide care, and 38% reported difficulty balancing work and caregiving. Employment changes were strongly associated with difficulty balancing work and caregiving (odds ratio [OR], 5.83; 95% CI, 2.38 to 14.0) and financial burden (OR, 2.12; 95% CI, 1.05 to 4.27). Difficulty balancing work and caregiving was associated with symptoms of anxiety (OR, 1.86; 95% CI, 1.01 to 3.43) and depression (OR, 2.40; 95% CI, 1.16 to 4.96). High (v low) financial burden was associated with symptoms of anxiety (OR, 2.85; 95% CI, 1.01 to 8.06).  Conclusion:   Difficulty balancing work and caregiving is common among caregivers of African American cancer survivors and is associated with symptoms of depression and anxiety.

Metastasis-directed radiotherapy (MDT) of PSMA-positive oligorecurrence is now frequently used, but the role of concurrent androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) remains unclear.  Objective:   To determine the effect of concurrent ADT with PSMA PET-directed MDT on biochemical progression-free survival (bRFS).  Design, setting, and participants:   This was a retrospective multicenter study of 305 patients with biochemical recurrence and PSMA PET-positive oligorecurrence following initial curative treatment between April 2013 and January 2018.  Intervention:   MDT with fractionated or stereotactic body radiotherapy for all PSMA-positive metastatic sites; 37.8% received concurrent ADT.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   The primary outcome was bRFS, which was measured using Kaplan-Meier curves and log-rank testing. Secondary outcomes were ADT-free survival, overall survival (OS), and toxicity was analyzed using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v4.03. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to determine independent clinicopathological factors.  Results and limitations:   The median follow-up was 16 mo (interquartile range 9-27). Some 96% of the patients initially had high-risk PCa. A median of one (range 0-19) nodal metastases and one (range 0-5) distant metastases were treated. MDT+ADT significantly improved bRFS and remained an independent factor (hazard ratio 0.28, 95% confidence interval 0.16-0.51; p<0.0001). bRFS was not significantly different between MDT+≤6 mo of ADT and MDT alone (p=0.121). Patients receiving MDT had 1- and 2-yr ADT-free survival of 93% and 83%, respectively. New therapies, most frequently MDT (23%), were required more frequently after MDT (85% vs 29%; p<0.001). Grade ≥3 acute toxicity was observed in 0.9% of patients and late toxicity in 2.3%.  Conclusions:   In this cohort of patients with oligorecurrent PCa, concurrent ADT with MDT improved bRFS significantly, but a large number of patients treated with MDT were spared from ADT for 2yr, although a greater need for other salvage therapies was observed.  Patient summary:   The role of concurrent androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) with radiotherapy for prostate cancer oligorecurrence identified on prostate-specific membrane antigen positron emission tomography was studied. We concluded that radiotherapy alone could prolong the time to start of ADT. However, the risk of disease progression and consequently the need for further treatments is higher after local radiotherapy alone without immediate ADT.""","""['Stephanie G C Kroeze', 'Christoph Henkenberens', 'Nina Sophie Schmidt-Hegemann', 'Marco M E Vogel', 'Simon Kirste', 'Jessica Becker', 'Irene A Burger', 'Thorsten Derlin', 'Peter Bartenstein', 'Matthias Eiber', 'Michael Mix', 'Christian la Fougère', 'Hans Christiansen', 'Claus Belka', 'Stephanie E Combs', 'Anca L Grosu', 'Arndt Christian Müller', 'Matthias Guckenberger']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Eur Urol Focus""","""['Efficacy of PSMA ligand PET-based radiotherapy for recurrent prostate cancer after radical prostatectomy and salvage radiotherapy.', 'Salvage radiotherapy in patients affected by oligorecurrent pelvic nodal prostate cancer.', 'SPARKLE: a new spark in treating oligorecurrent prostate cancer: adding systemic treatment to stereotactic body radiotherapy or metastasectomy: key to long-lasting event-free survival?', 'Prostate-specific membrane antigen-positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PSMA-PET/CT)-guided stereotactic ablative body radiotherapy for oligometastatic prostate cancer: a single-institution experience and review of the published literature.', 'Positron Emission Tomography and Whole-body Magnetic Resonance Imaging for Metastasis-directed Therapy in Hormone-sensitive Oligometastatic Prostate Cancer After Primary Radical Treatment: A Systematic Review.', 'Comparison of Hormone-Sensitive Oligorecurrent Prostate Cancer Patients Based on Routine Use of Choline and/or PSMA PET/CT to Guide Metastasis-Directed Therapy.', 'Salvage Nodal Radiotherapy as Metastasis-Directed Therapy for Oligorecurrent Prostate Cancer Detected by Positron Emission Tomography Shows Favorable Outcome in Long-Term Follow-Up.', 'Local Control after Locally Ablative, Image-Guided Radiotherapy of Oligometastases Identified by Gallium-68-PSMA-Positron Emission Tomography in Castration-Sensitive Prostate Cancer Patients (OLI-P).', 'The impact of PSMA PET on the treatment and outcomes of men with biochemical recurrence of prostate cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Intraindividual comparison of 68\xa0Ga-Ga-PSMA-11 and 18F-F-PSMA-1007 in prostate cancer patients: a retrospective single-center analysis.']"""

Objective:   To estimate relative and absolute PCa risks associated with BRCA1/2 mutations and to assess risk modification by age, family history, and mutation location.  Design, setting, and participants:   This was a prospective cohort study of male BRCA1 (n = 376) and BRCA2 carriers (n = 447) identified in clinical genetics centres in the UK and Ireland (median follow-up 5.9 and 5.3 yr, respectively).  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Standardised incidence/mortality ratios (SIRs/SMRs) relative to population incidences or mortality rates, absolute risks, and hazard ratios (HRs) were estimated using cohort and survival analysis methods.  Results and limitations:   Sixteen BRCA1 and 26 BRCA2 carriers were diagnosed with PCa during follow-up. BRCA2 carriers had an SIR of 4.45 (95% confidence interval [CI] 2.99-6.61) and absolute PCa risk of 27% (95% CI 17-41%) and 60% (95% CI 43-78%) by ages 75 and 85 yr, respectively. For BRCA1 carriers, the overall SIR was 2.35 (95% CI 1.43-3.88); the corresponding SIR at age <65 yr was 3.57 (95% CI 1.68-7.58). However, the BRCA1 SIR varied between 0.74 and 2.83 in sensitivity analyses to assess potential screening effects. PCa risk for BRCA2 carriers increased with family history (HR per affected relative 1.68, 95% CI 0.99-2.85). BRCA2 mutations in the region bounded by positions c.2831 and c.6401 were associated with an SIR of 2.46 (95% CI 1.07-5.64) compared to population incidences, corresponding to lower PCa risk (HR 0.37, 95% CI 0.14-0.96) than for mutations outside the region. BRCA2 carriers had a stronger association with Gleason score ≥7 (SIR 5.07, 95% CI 3.20-8.02) than Gleason score ≤6 PCa (SIR 3.03, 95% CI 1.24-7.44), and a higher risk of death from PCa (SMR 3.85, 95% CI 1.44-10.3). Limitations include potential screening effects for these known mutation carriers; however, the BRCA2 results were robust to multiple sensitivity analyses.  Conclusions:   The results substantiate PCa risk patterns indicated by retrospective analyses for BRCA2 carriers, including further evidence of association with aggressive PCa, and give some support for a weaker association in BRCA1 carriers.  Patient summary:   In this study we followed unaffected men known to carry mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes to investigate whether they are at higher risk of developing prostate cancer compared to the general population. We found that carriers of BRCA2 mutations have a high risk of developing prostate cancer, particularly more aggressive prostate cancer, and that this risk varies by family history of prostate cancer and the location of the mutation within the gene.""","""['Tommy Nyberg', 'Debra Frost', 'Daniel Barrowdale', 'D Gareth Evans', 'Elizabeth Bancroft', 'Julian Adlard', 'Munaza Ahmed', 'Julian Barwell', 'Angela F Brady', 'Carole Brewer', 'Jackie Cook', 'Rosemarie Davidson', 'Alan Donaldson', 'Jacqueline Eason', 'Helen Gregory', 'Alex Henderson', 'Louise Izatt', 'M John Kennedy', 'Claire Miller', 'Patrick J Morrison', 'Alex Murray', 'Kai-Ren Ong', 'Mary Porteous', 'Caroline Pottinger', 'Mark T Rogers', 'Lucy Side', 'Katie Snape', 'Lisa Walker', 'Marc Tischkowitz', 'Rosalind Eeles', 'Douglas F Easton', 'Antonis C Antoniou']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Eur Urol""","""['How Do We Respond to Men with BRCA Mutations when They Ask About Prostate Cancer?', 'Re: Prostate Cancer Risks for Male BRCA1 and BRCA2 Mutation Carriers: A Prospective Cohort Study.', 'Prostate Cancer Risk by BRCA2 Genomic Regions.', 'Risks of Breast, Ovarian, and Contralateral Breast Cancer for BRCA1 and BRCA2 Mutation Carriers.', 'The association of BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations with prostate cancer risk, frequency, and mortality: A meta-analysis.', 'Cancer risks for male carriers of germline mutations in BRCA1 or BRCA2: a review of the literature.', 'Prostate cancer risk, screening and management in patients with germline BRCA1/2 mutations.', 'LncRNA MIR4435-2HG drives cancer progression by modulating cell cycle regulators and mTOR signaling in stroma-enriched subtypes of urothelial carcinoma of the bladder.', 'Roles of the PARP Inhibitor in BRCA1 and BRCA2 Pathogenic Mutated Metastatic Prostate Cancer: Direct Functions and Modification of the Tumor Microenvironment.', 'Clinical risk management of breast, ovarian, pancreatic, and prostatic cancers for BRCA1/2 variant carriers in Japan.', 'Serum testosterone and prostate cancer in men with germline BRCA1/2 pathogenic variants.', 'Genetic Aspects and Molecular Testing in Prostate Cancer: A Report from a Dutch Multidisciplinary Consensus Meeting.']"""

Adoption of magnetic resonance imaging targeted biopsy (TB) permits optimized detection of clinically-significant cancer over systematic biopsy (SB) alone. We aim to evaluate the prognostic utility of the MSKCC Preprostatectomy nomogram with TB pathology results.  Methods:   Men who underwent SB and magnetic resonance imaging TB who later underwent radical prostatectomy at our institution were included. Patient information was entered into the MSKCC Preprostatectomy nomogram using 5 biopsy reporting schemes with TB reported by both individual core (IC) and aggregate group (AG) methods. The likelihood of extraprostatic extension, seminal vesicle invasion, and lymph node involvement as predicted by the nomogram for each biopsy reporting schema were compared to radical prostatectomy pathology.  Results:   We identified 63 men from January 2014 to November 2017. On receiver operating characteristic analysis, IC-TB, AG-TB, SB plus IC-TB, and SB plus AG-TB exhibited similar, if not improved, area under the curve compared to SB alone in predicting extraprostatic extension (0.671, 0.674, 0.658, and 0.6613 vs. 0.6085). This was similarly observed for seminal vesicle invasion prediction using SB plus IC-TB compared to SB alone (0.727 vs. 0.733). For lymph node involvement, superior but nonsignificant area under the curve was observed for AG-TB (0.647) compared to IC-TB (0.571) and SB alone (0.524) CONCLUSIONS: Using TB pathology results either alone or combined with SB pathology results as input to the MSKCC Preprostatectomy nomogram appears comparable for prognosticating adverse pathology on radical prostatectomy compared to SB alone, but robust validation is warranted prior to adoption into clinical practice.""","""['Zachary A Glaser', 'Jennifer B Gordetsky', 'Sejong Bae', 'Jeffrey W Nix', 'Kristin K Porter', 'Soroush Rais-Bahrami']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Urol Oncol""","""['Added Value of Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging to Clinical Nomograms for Predicting Adverse Pathology in Prostate Cancer.', 'Prostate Magnetic Resonance Imaging Provides Limited Incremental Value Over the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center Preradical Prostatectomy Nomogram.', 'Adding multiparametric MRI to the MSKCC and Partin nomograms for primary prostate cancer: Improving local tumor staging?', 'Targeted and Systematic Prostate Biopsy in Biopsy-naive Men With Positive Multiparameter Magnetic Resonance Imaging Findings: A Meta-analysis.', 'Risk of adverse pathology at prostatectomy in the era of MRI and targeted biopsies; rethinking active surveillance for intermediate risk prostate cancer patients.', 'Multiparametric MRI for Staging of Prostate Cancer: A Multicentric Analysis of Predictive Factors to Improve Identification of Extracapsular Extension before Radical Prostatectomy.', 'Integration of magnetic resonance imaging into prostate cancer nomograms.', 'Epigenetic loss of heterogeneity from low to high grade localized prostate tumours.', 'Utility of 18F-Fluciclovine PET/MRI for Staging Newly Diagnosed High-Risk Prostate Cancer and Evaluating Response to Initial Androgen Deprivation Therapy: A Prospective Single-Arm Pilot Study.']"""

Materials and methods:   Forty consecutive biopsy-confirmed PCa patients were included. Biopsy was performed within 4 weeks after the DCE-MRI examinations. According to the time-signal-intensity curve, lesion segmentation was performed on the first and on the strongest phase of the enhancement on the original DCE-MRI images, and 1,029 quantitative radiomics features were calculated automatically from each lesion, wherein there were three datasets available (Dataset-F, Dataset-S and Dataset-FS). The variance threshold method, select k-best method and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) algorithm were used to reduce the feature dimensions. Five machine learning approaches leveraging cross-validation were employed, and the clinical value of each model was evaluated by area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Correlation analysis was performed between the features of the machine learning model that achieved the best classification performance and the Gleason score (GS) of the PCa lesion.  Results:   Eight, four, and 16 features were selected as optimal subsets in Dataset-F, -S and -FS, respectively. Among all three datasets, logistic regression (LR)-based analysis with Dataset-FS had the highest predication efficacy (AUC=0.93). Ten features in Dataset-FS showed significantly positively correlation with GS. The model performance of Dataset-F was generally better than that in Dataset-S.

Here, we developed a pressure cycling technology (PCT)-SWATH mass spectrometry workflow to analyze FFPE tissue proteomes and applied it to the stratification of prostate cancer (PCa) and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) samples. We show that the proteome patterns of FFPE PCa tissue samples and their analogous fresh-frozen (FF) counterparts have a high degree of similarity and we confirmed multiple proteins consistently regulated in PCa tissues in an independent sample cohort. We further demonstrate temporal stability of proteome patterns from FFPE samples that were stored between 1 and 15 years in a biobank and show a high degree of the proteome pattern similarity between two types of histological regions in small FFPE samples, that is, punched tissue biopsies and thin tissue sections of micrometer thickness, despite the existence of a certain degree of biological variations. Applying the method to two independent DLBCL cohorts, we identified myeloperoxidase, a peroxidase enzyme, as a novel prognostic marker.

Methods:   A multicenter, cross-sectional survey was performed among men treated with prostatectomy, brachytherapy, external-beam radiotherapy and/or hormonal therapy.  Results:   In total, 412 questionnaires were analyzed. Of men with sexual side effects after treatment, 1 in 3 (32.5%, n = 109) reported their complaints as worse than expected; significantly more often reported by men treated surgically (P = .001), men with a local stage tumor (P = .005) and by men with a lower prostate-specific antigen level at diagnosis (P = .046). It was significantly less often reported by men treated with radiotherapy combined with hormonal therapy (P = .031). Men who used brochures as an information source reported their sexual side effects significantly less often as worse than expected (P < .001).  Conclusion:   One in three men with sexual side effects after prostate cancer treatment, experienced their complaints as worse than expected based on the obtained information prior to treatment. Men treated with radiotherapy combined with hormonal therapy indicated less discrepancy between expectations and developed sexual side effects, whereas prostatectomy, low stage tumor and low prostate-specific antigen level were associated with more discrepancy.

SHetA2, a first-generation Flex-Het, has been shown to inhibit the growth of cervical, head and neck, kidney, lung, ovarian, prostate, and breast cancers. However, SHetA2's high lipophilicity, limited selectivity, low oral bioavailability, and complicated synthesis has led to the development of second-generation compounds, such as 1-(1-(naphthalen-1-yl)ethyl)-3-(4-nitrophenyl) thiourea or SL-1-09. Results from our lab show that SL-1-09 exhibits anti-cancer activities against ERα+ and ERα- breast cancer cells at micromolar concentrations. SL-1-09 is a mixture of two enantiomers, R and S. The objective of this study was to further analyze these enantiomers to determine their individual anti-cancer activities. Cell cycle analysis demonstrated that the percentage of cells in S-phase is reduced significantly when breast cancer cell lines MCF-7, T47D and MDA-MB-453 cells are treated with 5.0 μM of the S enantiomer. Consistent with this finding, treatment of these cells with the S enantiomer resulted in lower expression levels of cell cycle proteins. Overall, our data indicate that the S enantiomer shows greater growth inhibitory effects than the R form against ERα+ (MCF7 and T47D) and ERα- (MDA-MB-453) breast cancer cells, suggesting that the activity observed in SL-1-09 is most likely due to the ability of the S enantiomer to block cell cycle progression.""","""['Emily Ginn', 'Jihyun Baek', 'Hongye Zou', 'Maryam M J Fallatah', 'Shengquan Liu', 'Mary B Sevigny', 'Maggie Louie']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Eur J Pharmacol""","""['Novel flexible heteroarotinoid, SL-1-18, promotes ERα degradation to inhibit breast cancer cell growth.', 'Novel flexible heteroarotinoid, SL-1-39, inhibits HER2-positive breast cancer cell proliferation by promoting lysosomal degradation of HER2.', 'Synthesis and evaluation of second generation Flex-Het scaffolds against the human ovarian cancer A2780 cell line.', 'Development of flexible-heteroarotinoids for kidney cancer.', 'Flexible heteroarotinoids (Flex-Hets) exhibit improved therapeutic ratios as anti-cancer agents over retinoic acid receptor agonists.']"""

Materials and methods:   Twenty-six men selected for radical treatment with radiotherapy were recruited prospectively and underwent pre-treatment T2W+DW-MRI and 5 mm spaced transperineal template-guided mapping prostate biopsies (TTMPB). A 'traffic-light' system was used to score both data sets. Radiologically suspicious lesions measuring ≥0.5 cm3 were classified as red; suspicious lesions 0.2-0.5 cm3 or larger lesions equivocal for tumour were classified as amber. The histopathology assessment combined pathological grade and tumour length on biopsy (red = ≥4 mm primary Gleason grade 4/5 or ≥6 mm primary Gleason grade 3). Two radiologists assessed the MRI data and inter-observer agreement was measured with Cohens' Kappa co-efficient.

CYP1B1 is related to tumor formation and is over-expressed in a variety of cancer cells. In particular, CYP1B1 is highly expressed in hormone-related cancers such as breast cancer, ovarian cancer, or prostate cancer compared to other cancers. However, the detailed mechanisms involving this protein remain unclear. In this study, we demonstrate that CYP1B1 affects X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP) expression. When CYP1B1 was over-expressed in cells, there was significant increase in the XIAP protein level, whereas the XIAP mRNA level was not affected by CYP1B1 expression. Treatment with 4-OHE2, mainly formed by CYP1B1 activity, also increased XIAP protein levels, whereas treatment with 2-OHE2 did not have a significant effect. Treatment with 4-OHE2 significantly prevented proteasome-mediated XIAP degradation. In addition, phosphorylation of XIAP on serine 87, which is known to stabilize XIAP, was up-regulated by 4-OHE2, indicating that 4-OHE2 affects XIAP stability through XIAP phosphorylation. We also found that phosphorylation of protein kinase C (PKC)ε, which is required for XIAP phosphorylation, increased when cells were treated with 4-OHE2.

Production of AREG is triggered by DNA damage to stromal cells, which passively enter senescence in the tumor microenvironment (TME), a process that remarkably enhances cancer malignancy including acquired resistance mediated by EGFR. Furthermore, paracrine AREG induces programmed cell death 1 ligand (PD-L1) expression in recipient cancer cells and creates an immunosuppressive TME via immune checkpoint activation against cytotoxic lymphocytes. Targeting AREG not only minimized chemoresistance of cancer cells, but also restored immunocompetency when combined with classical chemotherapy in humanized animals.

Materials and methods:   Seven hundred three (n = 703) prostate cancer (PCa) patients with confirmed PSA failure after radical therapy were enrolled. Patients were stratified according to different clinical settings (first-time biochemical recurrence [BCR]: group 1; BCR after salvage therapy: group 2; biochemical persistence after radical prostatectomy [BCP]: group 3; advanced-stage PCa before second-line systemic therapies: group 4). First, we assessed 68Ga-PSMA-11-PET/CT positivity rate. Second, multivariable logistic regression analyses were used to determine predictors of positive scan. Third, regression-based coefficients were used to develop a nomogram predicting positive 68Ga-PSMA-11-PET/CT result and 200 bootstrap resamples were used for internal validation. Fourth, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was used to identify the most informative nomogram's derived cutoff. Decision curve analysis (DCA) was implemented to quantify nomogram's clinical benefit.  Results: 68Ga-PSMA-11-PET/CT overall positivity rate was 51.2%, while it was 40.3% in group 1, 54% in group 2, 60.5% in group 3, and 86.9% in group 4 (p < 0.001). At multivariable analyses, ISUP grade, PSA, PSA doubling time, and clinical setting were independent predictors of a positive scan (all p ≤ 0.04). A nomogram based on covariates included in the multivariate model demonstrated a bootstrap-corrected accuracy of 82%. The nomogram-derived best cutoff value was 40%. In DCA, the nomogram revealed clinical net benefit of > 10%.  Conclusions:   This novel nomogram proved its good accuracy in predicting a positive scan, with values ≥ 40% providing the most informative cutoff in counselling patients to 68Ga-PSMA-11-PET/CT.

There are few studies investigating fluciclovine with PET/MR and none evaluated osseous metastases. Our aim was to assess the performance of 18F-fluciclovine PET/MR (fluciclovine-PET/MR) for detecting osseous metastases in patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). We also investigated possible correlations between SUVmax and ADCmean.  Methods:   We evaluated 8 patients with CRPC metastatic to bones, some before and some after radium therapy, who underwent 13 fluciclovine-PET/MR studies. We analyzed the performance of radionuclide bone scan (RBS), MR alone, fluciclovine-PET alone, and fluciclovine-PET/MR in detecting osseous metastases. Lesion size, characteristics (early sclerotic, late sclerotic, mixed, lytic), SUVmax, and ADCmean were assessed. The reference standard was a combination of clinical information and correlation with both prior and follow-up imaging.  Results:   Of 347 metastatic bony lesions in 13 studies, 238/347 (68%) were detected by fluciclovine-PET alone, 286/347 (82%) by RBS, 344/347 (99%) by MR alone, and 347/347 (100%) by fluciclovine-PET/MR. Fluciclovine-PET/MR and MR had the best performance (p < 0.001). There was no statistically significant difference between fluciclovine-PET/MR and MR alone (p = 0.25). Fluciclovine-PET had a lower detection rate especially with late sclerotic lesions (p < 0.001). There was a moderate inverse correlation between lesion SUVmax and ADCmean (r = - 0.49; p < 0.001).  Conclusions:   This study suggests that fluciclovine-PET/MR and MR have high sensitivity for detecting osseous metastases in CRPC. Fluciclovine-PET alone underperformed in detecting late sclerotic lesions. The inverse correlation between SUVmax and ADCmean suggests a possible relationship between tumor metabolism and cellularity.""","""['Barbara J Amorim', 'Vinay Prabhu', 'Sara S Marco', 'Debra Gervais', 'Willian E Palmer', 'Pedram Heidari', 'Mark Vangel', 'Philip J Saylor', 'Onofrio A Catalano']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Eur J Nucl Med Mol Imaging""","""['Performance of 18F-fluciclovine PET/MR in the evaluation of osseous metastases from castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'More advantages in detecting bone and soft tissue metastases from prostate cancer using 18F-PSMA PET/CT.', 'Uptake of Radium-223 Dichloride and Early 18FNaF PET Response Are Driven by Baseline 18FNaF Parameters: a Pilot Study in Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer Patients.', 'Diagnostic Performance of 18F-Fluciclovine in Detection of Prostate Cancer Bone Metastases.', '18F-Fluciclovine PET for Assessment of Prostate Cancer with Histopathology as Reference Standard: A Systematic Review.', 'Evaluating radium-223 response in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer with imaging.', 'Management Impact of Metachronous Oligometastatic Disease Identified on 18F-Fluciclovine (Axumin™) PET/CT in Biochemically Recurrent Prostate Cancer.', 'An international expert opinion statement on the utility of PET/MR for imaging of skeletal metastases.', 'Performance of 18F-fluciclovine PET/MR in the evaluation of osseous metastases from castration-resistant prostate cancer.']"""

A specific member of this family, the SWI/SNF complex antagonist associated with prostate cancer 1 (SChLAP1), has been shown to promote aggressive prostate cancer growth by antagonizing the SWI/SNF complex and therefore serves as a biomarker for poor prognosis. Here, we investigated whether SChLAP1 plays a potential role in the development of human glioblastoma (GBM).  Experimental design:   RNA-ISH and IHC were performed on a tissue microarray to assess expression of SChLAP1 and associated proteins in human gliomas. Proteins complexed with SChLAP1 were identified using RNA pull-down and mass spectrometry. Lentiviral constructs were used for functional analysis in vitro and in vivo.  Results: SChLAP1 was increased in primary GBM samples and cell lines, and knockdown of the lncRNA suppressed growth. SChLAP1 was found to bind heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein L (HNRNPL), which stabilized the lncRNA and led to an enhanced interaction with the protein actinin alpha 4 (ACTN4). ACTN4 was also highly expressed in primary GBM samples and was associated with poorer overall survival in glioma patients. The SChLAP1-HNRNPL complex led to stabilization of ACTN4 through suppression of proteasomal degradation, which resulted in increased nuclear localization of the p65 subunit of NF-κB and activation of NF-κB signaling, a pathway associated with cancer development.  Conclusions:   Our results implicated SChLAP1 as a driver of GBM growth as well as a potential therapeutic target in treatment of the disease.""","""['Jianxiong Ji#', 'Ran Xu#', 'Kaikai Ding', 'Guoqing Bao', 'Xin Zhang', 'Bin Huang', 'Xinyu Wang', 'Aurora Martinez', 'Xiuying Wang', 'Gang Li', 'Hrvoje Miletic', 'Frits Thorsen', 'Rolf Bjerkvig', 'Lei Xiang', 'Bo Han', 'Anjing Chen', 'Xingang Li', 'Jian Wang']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Clin Cancer Res""","""['LncRNA PRADX-mediated recruitment of PRC2/DDX5 complex suppresses UBXN1 expression and activates NF-κB activity, promoting tumorigenesis.', 'S100A11 functions as novel oncogene in glioblastoma via S100A11/ANXA2/NF-κB positive feedback loop.', 'PTRF/Cavin-1 as a Novel RNA-Binding Protein Expedites the NF-κB/PD-L1 Axis by Stabilizing lncRNA NEAT1, Contributing to Tumorigenesis and Immune Evasion in Glioblastoma.', 'Exploring the Roles of lncRNAs in GBM Pathophysiology and Their Therapeutic Potential.', 'Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNPL) in cancer.', 'Insights into the Role of LncRNAs and miRNAs in Glioma Progression and Their Potential as Novel Therapeutic Targets.', 'Regulation of CD8+ T cells infiltration and immunotherapy by circMGA/HNRNPL complex in bladder cancer.', 'Long Noncoding RNAs and Cancer Stem Cells: Dangerous Liaisons Managing Cancer.', 'An Aggrephagy-Related LncRNA Signature for the Prognosis of Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma.', 'Identification and validation of endocrine resistance-related and immune-related long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) signatures for predicting endocrinotherapy response and prognosis in breast cancer.']"""

Then, the popular global weighted voting method and normalized mutual information method are applied to calculate the weights and carry out the label image fusion. The map selection method based on mutual information substantially completes the segmentation of the MRI image prostate. The prostate position is basically found on the 10 test images, and the positioning of the prostate organs is deviated in the worst case. In the case of poor multi-map segmentation, it usually happens when those are not well represented in the map. Because of the structural similarity of medical images, multi-atlas segmentation based on normalized mutual information method can be done. Using the prior information of atlas, the atlas label image can be selected. After fusion, the final segmentation of the test image can be completed, which has a high accuracy for the location of prostate cancer. This method can accurately delineate the target area in radiotherapy of prostate cancer and reduce the damage of rectum, bladder and other organs caused by radiotherapy. However, there are still some problems in this study, such as inadequate segmentation accuracy, long data processing time and so on.

As part of the Ageing, Chronic Disease and Injury study, we aimed to map the incidence rates of primary cancer diagnoses across western Victoria and investigate the association of age, accessibility/remoteness index of Australia (ARIA) and area-level socioeconomic status (SES) with cancer incidence.  Methods:   Data on cancer incidence in the study region were extracted from the Victorian Cancer Registry (VCR) for men and women aged 40+ years during 2010-2013, inclusive. The age-adjusted incidence rates (per 10,000 population/year), as well as specific incidence for breast, prostate, lung, bowel and melanoma cancers, were calculated for the entire region and for the 21 Local Government Areas (LGA) that make up the whole region. The association of aggregated age, ARIA and SES with cancer incidence rates across LGAs was determined using Poisson regression.  Results:   Overall, 15,120 cancer cases were identified; 8218 (54%) men and 6902 women. For men, the age-standardised rate of cancer incidence for the whole region was 182.1 per 10,000 population/year (95% CI 177.7-186.5) and for women, 162.2 (95% CI: 157.9-166.5). The incidence of cancer (overall) increased with increasing age for men and women. Geographical variations in cancer incidence were also observed across the LGAs, with differences identified between men and women. Residents of socioeconomically disadvantaged and less accessible areas had higher cancer incidence (p < 0.001).  Conclusion:   Cancer incidence rates varied by age, sex, across LGAs and with ARIA. These findings not only provide an evidence base for identifying gaps and assessing the need for services and resource allocation across this region, but also informs policy and assists health service planning and implementation of preventative intervention strategies to reduce the incidence of cancer across western Victoria.

However, there is a paucity of evidence to indicate who may be targeted for aggressive therapy among patients with nmCRPC. The objectives of this retrospective study were to explore predictors of metastasis in patients with nmCRPC and to identify a subpopulation of patients with nmCRPC who may benefit from aggressive therapy.  Methods:   A total of 115 patients with CRPC who had no metastasis detected at the time of diagnosis of CRPC were included in this retrospective study. All patients were treated at Jikei University and its affiliated hospitals. The primary outcome measure was MFS from the time of diagnosis of CRPC. Predictors of MFS were also explored with a multivariate Cox hazard model.  Results:   The median observation period after diagnosis of CRPC was 30 months (range 2-143 months). Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed a median MFS of 76. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that low alkaline phosphatase (ALP) values at diagnosis of CRPC and favorable response to primary androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) were significant predictors of longer MFS (P = 0.011, and 0.031, respectively).  Conclusions:   Results of this study suggest that high ALP values at diagnosis of CRPC and poor response to primary ADT may predict the propensity of metastasis in patients with nmCRPC.

However, it is unknown if radical prostatectomy (RP) may achieve equivalent results, since existing studies did neither include the same selection criteria nor examine comparable endpoints as STAMPEDE arm H.  Methods:   We retrospectively analysed 78 RP patients (2008-2018) with LMB (< 4 bone metastases) as defined in the subgroup analysis of STAMPEDE arm H. Like in STAMPEDE, overall (OS), metastatic progression-free (MPFS), and PCa-specific (CSS) survival at 3 years, as well as complication and continence rates were assessed.  Results:   Median age was 64 years. Median follow-up was 36 months. Median initial prostate-specific antigen was 35 ng/ml. At 3 years, OS was 91%, MPFS was 63%, and CSS was 92%, while 81%, 67%, and 86%, respectively, were reported in the RT subgroup with LMB in STAMPEDE arm H. Clavien-Dindo grade III-IV complications were observed in 16 (21%) patients. Of 38 patients with available continence data, 28 (74%) patients were continent and 2 (5%) patients needed ≥ 3 pads/day at 1 year after RP.  Conclusions:   When comparing our RP cohort with the results of STAMPEDE arm H with LMB who received RT, no major disadvantage in OS and CSS may be expected. Since local treatment in patients with LMB might now be considered the new standard, RP should be further explored as local treatment option in these patients.""","""['Sophie Knipper', 'Burkhard Beyer', 'Philipp Mandel', 'Pierre Tennstedt', 'Derya Tilki', 'Thomas Steuber', 'Markus Graefen']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""World J Urol""","""['Optimal PSA Threshold for Androgen-Deprivation Therapy in Patients with Prostate Cancer following Radical Prostatectomy and Adjuvant Radiation Therapy.', 'Long-term follow-up of patients with prostate cancer and nodal metastases treated by pelvic lymphadenectomy and radical prostatectomy: the positive impact of adjuvant radiotherapy.', 'Radical prostatectomy improves progression-free and cancer-specific survival in men with lymph node positive prostate cancer in the prostate-specific antigen era: a confirmatory study.', 'Treatment concepts for primary oligometastatic prostate cancer.', 'Adjuvant radiotherapy following radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer.', 'An Updated Systematic and Comprehensive Review of Cytoreductive Prostatectomy for Metastatic Prostate Cancer.', 'Diagnosis and staging of metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer.', 'Focal therapy for primary tumor and metastases in de novo or recurrent oligometastatic prostate cancer: current standing and future perspectives.', 'Defining Oligometastatic Disease in the New Era of PSMA-PET Imaging for Primary Staging of Prostate Cancer.', 'Primary Tumor Treatment in Oligometastatic Prostate Cancer: Radiotherapy Versus Radical Prostatectomy.']"""

While a range of immune lineages is found in the prostate including T cells, B cells and myeloid cells, the specific subsets of immune cells with each major lineage have not been well described. In this study, we use mass cytometry (CyTOF) to comprehensively and reproducibly profile immune cells in mouse and human prostate. Using 4 myeloid markers (CD11b, CD11c, F4/80, Ly6C) in the mouse, we identified 8 phenotypically-distinct myeloid populations, demonstrating considerable heterogeneity within the immune compartment of the mouse prostate. We then profiled the prostate immune microenvironment from 9 human patients. Unlike the mouse prostate which is myeloid-dominant, the immune compartment in the benign human prostate is consistently T-lymphocyte-dominant. Using the X-shift algorithm to identify individual immune subsets based on marker expression, we found 57 phenotypically-distinct immune cell types in the human prostate. Despite similar proportions of T, B and myeloid lineage cells in the benign human prostate of all patients evaluated, we observed considerable interpatient heterogeneity in the abundance of more specific immune subsets.

These components convert uridine to pseudouridine (abbreviated ψ), a type of post-transcriptional modification of RNA. Given the increased abundance of H/ACA snoRNAs and expression of DKC1 in prostate carcinomas, and because whole-body turnover of RNA increases in support of rapidly-growing cancer cells, we examined the value of pseudouridine as a biomarker for prostate cancer.  Methods:   Using a monoclonal antibody against pseudouridine, we tested its ability to distinguish between two 25-base RNA oligonucleotide sequences that differed by only one ψ-substitution, and subsequently measured ψ in RNA isolated from several prostate cancer cell lines representing different stages of disease using dot blot assays and pseudouridinylated RNA linked immunosorbent assay (PURLISA). We also performed immunohistochemistry on a tissue micro array (12 cases/24 cores) containing prostate adenocarcinomas and normal adjacent tissue (NAT).

First-line mCRPC treatment with enzalutamide and AAP yields similar overall survival and radiographic progression-free survival in phase III trials. Thus, treatment selection relies on patient choice, cost and side effects. The aim of this randomised trial is to investigate differences in fatigue, health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and metabolic side effects in men with mCRPC treated with first-line enzalutamide versus AAP.  Methods and analysis:   In this ongoing open-label randomised (1:1) clinical trial, enzalutamide is compared with AAP as first-line treatment for men with mCRPC. The primary endpoint is fatigue assessed with the questionnaire Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue version 4. Secondary endpoints are changes in body composition (ie, fat mass, visceral adipose tissue, subcutaneous adipose tissue and lean body mass assessed with dual energy X-ray absorptiometry), glucose metabolism assessed with a 2-hour oral glucose tolerance test, serum lipids, blood pressure and HRQoL assessed with the questionnaire Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Prostate (FACT-P). All study endpoints are assessed at baseline and 12-week postintervention. Blood and urine samples are collected at baseline and at time of progression on allocated treatment for future investigation of predictive and prognostic biomarkers in prostate cancer treatment.

We propose a case-based reasoning framework designed to handle novel anatomies that are of same type but vary beyond original training samples. A total of 105 pelvic intensity-modulated radiotherapy cases were analyzed. Eighty cases were prostate cases while the other 25 were prostate-plus-lymph-node cases. We simulated 4 scenarios: Scarce scenario, Semiscarce scenario, Semiample scenario, and Ample scenario. For the Scarce scenario, a multiple stepwise regression model was trained using 85 cases (80 prostate, 5 prostate-plus-lymph-node). The proposed workflow started with evaluating the feature novelty of new cases against 5 training prostate-plus-lymph-node cases using leverage statistic. The case database was composed of a 5-case dose atlas. Case-based dose prediction was compared against the regression model prediction using sum of squared residual. Mean sum of squared residual of case-based and regression predictions for the bladder of 13 identified outliers were 0.174 ± 0.166 and 0.459 ± 0.508, respectively (P = .0326). For the rectum, the respective mean sum of squared residuals were 0.103 ± 0.120 and 0.150 ± 0.171 for case-based and regression prediction (P = .1972). By retaining novel cases, under the Ample scenario, significant statistical improvement was observed over the Scarce scenario (P = .0398) for the bladder model.

Besides that, the majority of the existing datasets consist of bulk sequencing data of single tumor sample of an individual. Accurate inference of the phylogenetic order of mutations is particularly challenging in these cases and the existing methods are faced with several theoretical limitations. To overcome these limitations, new methods are required for integrating and harnessing the full potential of the existing data.  Results:   We introduce a method called Hintra for intra-tumor heterogeneity detection. Hintra integrates sequencing data for a cohort of tumors and infers tumor phylogeny for each individual based on the evolutionary information shared between different tumors. Through an iterative process, Hintra learns the repeating evolutionary patterns and uses this information for resolving the phylogenetic ambiguities of individual tumors. The results of synthetic experiments show an improved performance compared to two state-of-the-art methods.

Thus, the development of new strategies is urgently needed. Tanshinones isolated from Salvia miltiorrhiza and its synthetic analogs show various biological activities including anticancer effects. Among them, the tanshinone analog 2-((Glycine methyl ester)methyl)-naphtho (TC7) is the most effective, with better selectivity and lower toxicity. Therefore, in this work, the effect of TC7 against PCa was investigated through assessing the molecular mechanisms regulating the growth, metastasis, and invasion of PCa cells. Human PCa cells, PC3 and LNCAP, were used to evaluate TC7 mechanisms of action in vitro, while male BALB/c nude mice were used for in vivo experiments by subjecting each mouse to a subcutaneous injection of PC3 cells into the right flank to evaluate TC7 effects on tumor volume. Our in vitro results showed that TC7 inhibited cell proliferation by arresting the cell cycle at G2/M through the regulation of cyclin b1, p53, GADD45A, PLK1, and CDC2/cyclin b1. In addition, TC7 induced cell apoptosis by regulating apoptosis-associated genes such as p53, ERK1, BAX, p38, BCL-2, caspase-8, cleaved-caspase-8, PARP1, and the phosphorylation level of ERK1 and p38. Furthermore, it decreased DNA synthesis and inhibited the migration and invasion ability by regulating VEGF-1 and MMP-9 protein expression. Our in vivo evidence supports the conclusion that TC7 could be considered as a potential promising chemotherapeutic candidate in the treatment of PCa.""","""['Mengling Wang', 'Xueyi Zeng', 'Shengyou Li', 'Zekun Sun', 'Jia Yu', 'Chao Chen', 'Xiangchun Shen', 'Weidong Pan', 'Heng Luo']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Int J Mol Sci""","""['Tanshinones from Chinese medicinal herb Danshen (Salvia miltiorrhiza Bunge) suppress prostate cancer growth and androgen receptor signaling.', 'Apoptosis induced by the methanol extract of Salvia miltiorrhiza Bunge in non-small cell lung cancer through PTEN-mediated inhibition of PI3K/Akt pathway.', 'Evaluation of the anticancer and anti-metastasis effects of novel synthetic sodium channel blockers in prostate cancer cells in vitro and in vivo.', 'Pharmacological properties of tanshinones, the natural products from Salvia miltiorrhiza.', 'Tanshinones: sources, pharmacokinetics and anti-cancer activities.', 'Salvia miltiorrhiza in cancer: Potential role in regulating MicroRNAs and epigenetic enzymes.', 'Molecular Mechanism of Tanshinone against Prostate Cancer.', 'Tanshinone IIA induces autophagy in colon cancer cells through MEK/ERK/mTOR pathway.', 'Combination prostate cancer therapy: Prostate-specific membranes antigen targeted, pH-sensitive nanoparticles loaded with doxorubicin and tanshinone.', 'Quercetin and Its Nano-Scale Delivery Systems in Prostate Cancer Therapy: Paving the Way for Cancer Elimination and Reversing Chemoresistance.']"""

However, the presence of the magnetic field imposes a challenge for the beam delivery as protons are deflected due to the Lorenz force. In this study, the impact of realistic inline MRI fringe field on IMPT plan delivery is investigated for a water phantom, liver tumor and prostate cancer differing in target volume, shape, and field configuration using Monte Carlo simulations. A method to correct for the shift of the beam spot positions in the presence of the inline magnetic field is presented. Results show that when not accounting for the effect of the magnetic field on the pencil beam delivery, the spot positions are substantially shifted and the quality of delivered plans is significantly deteriorated leading to dose inhomogeneities and creation of hot and cold spots. However, by correcting the pencil beam delivery, the dose quality of the IMPT plans is restored to a high degree. Nevertheless, adaptation of beam delivery alone is not robust regarding different treatment sites. By fully accounting during plan optimization for the dose distortions caused by the fringe and imaging fields, highly conformal IMPT plans are achieved. These results demonstrate proton pencil beam scanning and treatment planning can be adapted for precise delivery of state-of-the-art IMPT plans in MR-guided proton therapy in the presence of an inline MRI fringe field.""","""['Lucas N Burigo', 'Bradley M Oborn']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Phys Med Biol""","""['A Monte-Carlo study to assess the effect of 1.5 T magnetic fields on the overall robustness of pencil-beam scanning proton radiotherapy plans for prostate cancer.', 'Fan-beam intensity modulated proton therapy.', 'Integrated beam orientation and scanning-spot optimization in intensity-modulated proton therapy for brain and unilateral head and neck tumors.', 'Empowering Intensity Modulated Proton Therapy Through Physics and Technology: An Overview.', 'Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) guided proton therapy: A review of the clinical challenges, potential benefits and pathway to implementation.', 'Advances in Image-Guided Radiotherapy in the Treatment of Oral Cavity Cancer.', 'The history of ion beam therapy in Germany.', 'Comparative Evaluation of 4-Dimensional Computed Tomography and 4-Dimensional Magnetic Resonance Imaging to Delineate the Target of Primary Liver Cancer.', 'MR-guided proton therapy: a review and a preview.', 'Benchmarking a GATE/Geant4 Monte Carlo model for proton beams in magnetic fields.']"""

Methods:   Using a 20% sample of Medicare claims, we identified men with incident prostate cancer from 2010 through 2014 and assigned each to his predominant urologist. We linked each urologist to a practice and characterized the practice's organization (eg, solo, single specialty, multispecialty) and ownership of intensity-modulated radiation therapy. For each group, we determined the rate of conservative management within 1 year of diagnosis. We then fit mixed-effects logistic regression models to assess relationships between practice organization and the adoption of conservative management over time, adjusted for patient characteristics.  Results:   We identified 22,178 men with newly diagnosed prostate cancer managed by 350 practices. Practices that increased use the most over time also used conservative management the most in 2010, whereas those that increased use the least used conservative management the least in 2010. Thus, the difference in average use of conservative management between highest- and lowest-use practices widened between 2010 and 2014. Urology groups increased their use of conservative management more rapidly than multispecialty groups. There was no difference in the rate of increase between intensity-modulated radiation therapy owning and nonowning groups.  Conclusion:   There is increasing variation among group practices in the use of conservative management for prostate cancer. This underscores the need for a better understanding of practice-level factors that influence prostate cancer management.""","""['Parth K Modi', 'Samuel R Kaufman', 'Lindsey A Herrel', 'James M Dupree', 'Amy N Luckenbaugh', 'Ted A Skolarus', 'Brent K Hollenbeck', 'Vahakn B Shahinian']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""J Oncol Pract""","""['Urology Workforce Changes and Implications for Prostate Cancer Care Among Medicare Enrollees.', 'Urologist Practice Structure and Spending for Prostate Cancer Care.', 'Urologist Practice Affiliation and Intensity-modulated Radiation Therapy for Prostate Cancer in the Elderly.', 'Clarifying uncertainty regarding detection and treatment of early-stage prostate cancer.', 'Detection and treatment of prostate cancer: perspective of the urologist.', 'Implications of the Merit-Based Incentive Payment System for Urology Practices.', ""The Influence of Practice Structure on Urologists' Treatment of Men With Low-Risk Prostate Cancer."", 'Impact of Advanced Practice Provider Integration into Multispecialty Group Practices on Outcomes Following Major Surgery.', 'Urology Workforce Changes and Implications for Prostate Cancer Care Among Medicare Enrollees.']"""

However, the effects of COPS3 on prostate cancer (PCa) are poorly understood.  Methods:   In this study, the protein expression of COPS3 in PCa tissues, adjacent normal tissues, and bone metastasis tissues of PCa was analyzed by immunohistochemistry. Furthermore, cell proliferation, colony formation, migration, and invasion assay were performed in 22rv1 and PC-3 cells after knocking down COPS3 by small interfering RNAs. Furthermore, we performed western blot analysis to explore the potential mechanisms underlying it.  Results:   This study found that the overall survival of the COPS3 high-expression group was significantly shorter than the low-expression group. This study discovered that the protein expression of COPS3 in PCa tissues was higher than that in the matched nontumor prostate tissues. In addition, tissues from bone metastasis of PCa had a high percentage of overexpressing COPS3. After knockdown of the COPS3 gene in 22rv1 and PC3 cells, two classic human PCa cell lines which had a high level of COPS3, the abilities of migration, invasion, and proliferation were inhibited. Finally, protein levels of phosphorylated P38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and N-cadherin were significantly decreased after knocking down the expression of COPS3, and the protein levels of E-cadherin were significantly increased.

Methods:   The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database was queried for patients aged >18 years diagnosed with primary DLBCL from 1973 to 2010 and categorized by early stage (ES) (stage I-II) or advanced stage (AS) (stage III-IV) disease. Differences in overall and location-specific SPM incidence by stage and time since diagnosis were assessed in 5-year intervals using a Fine-Gray hazards model. Overall survival was compared using the log-rank test. A Cox proportional hazards model was used to assess differences in survival.  Results:   In total, 26,038 patients with DLBCL were identified, including 14,724 with ES and 11,314 with AS disease. The median follow-up was 13.3 years. Overall, 13.0% of patients developed SPM, with a higher but nonsignificantly increased risk of SPM development in those who had ES disease compared with those who had AS disease (14% vs 11.6%; P = .14). During the first 5 years after diagnosis, patients who had ES disease had a higher risk of SPM than those who had AS disease, specifically colorectal, pancreas, breast, and prostate SPMs. During the period from 10 to 15 years after diagnosis, patients who had AS disease had a higher risk of SPM than those who had ES disease, specifically hematologic SPMs. Development of SPM was found to significantly increase the risk of death regardless of stage at diagnosis.  Conclusions:   In this large, population-based study, distinctly different subtypes and temporal patterns of SPM development were identified based on stage of DLBCL at diagnosis.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-guided biopsy may improve the characterization of prostate pathologic results, but few studies have examined its use for the decision to enter active surveillance.  Objective:   To evaluate whether confirmatory biopsy findings by MRI guidance are associated with the risk of pathologic disease upgrading among patients with prostate cancer during active surveillance.  Design, settings, and participants:   This retrospective cohort study used prospectively obtained registry data from 332 men with prostate cancer of Gleason grade group (GG) 2 or lower who were referred for active surveillance at a large academic medical center from January 1, 2009, through December 31, 2017.  Exposures:   All confirmatory and follow-up biopsies were performed using MRI guidance with an MRI-ultrasonography fusion device. Patients underwent repeated MRI-guided biopsies every 12 to 24 months. At follow-up sessions, in addition to obtaining systematic samples, lesions seen on MRI were targeted and foci of low-grade prostate cancer were obtained again using tracking technology. Active surveillance was terminated with detection of at least GG3 disease or receipt of treatment.  Main outcomes and measures:   The primary outcome was upgrading to at least GG3 disease during active surveillance. Secondary outcomes were the associations of MRI lesion grade, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level, PSA density, and biopsy method (targeted, systematic, or tracked) with the primary outcome.  Results:   Of 332 patients (mean [SD] age, 62.8 [7.6] years), 39 (11.7%) upgraded to at least GG3 disease during follow-up. The incidence of upgrading was 7.9% (9 of 114) when the confirmatory biopsy finding was normal, 11.4% (20 of 175) when the finding showed GG1 disease, and 23.3% (10 of 43) when the finding was GG2 disease (P = .03). Men with GG2 disease were almost 8 times more likely to upgrade during surveillance compared with those with normal findings but only among those with low PSA density (hazard ratio [HR], 7.82; 95% CI, 2.29-26.68). A PSA density of at least 0.15 ng/mL/mL was associated with increased risk of upgrading among patients with normal findings (HR, 7.21; 95% CI, 1.98-26.24) or GG1 disease (HR, 2.86; 95% CI, 1.16 to 7.03) on confirmatory biopsy. A total of 46% of pathologic disease upgrades would have been missed if only the targeted biopsy was performed and 65% of disease upgrades were detected only with tracked biopsy.  Conclusions and relevance:   The findings suggest that confirmatory biopsy with MRI guidance is significantly associated with future disease upgrading of prostate cancer, especially when combined with PSA density, and should be considered as an appropriate entry point for active surveillance. Systematic and targeted biopsies were additive in detection of clinically significant cancers. Repeated biopsy at sites at which findings were previously abnormal (tracking biopsy) facilitated detection of cancers not suitable for continued active surveillance.""","""['Rajiv Jayadevan', 'Ely R Felker', 'Lorna Kwan', 'Danielle E Barsa', 'Haoyue Zhang', 'Anthony E Sisk', 'Merdie Delfin', 'Leonard S Marks']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""JAMA Netw Open""","""['Risk-stratification based on magnetic resonance imaging and prostate-specific antigen density may reduce unnecessary follow-up biopsy procedures in men on active surveillance for low-risk prostate cancer.', 'Active Surveillance Magnetic Resonance Imaging Study (ASIST): Results of a Randomized Multicenter Prospective Trial.', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging-Guided Biopsy in Active Surveillance of Prostate Cancer.', 'Use of multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) in active surveillance for low-risk prostate cancer: a scoping review on the benefits and harm of mpMRI in different biopsy scenarios.', 'Targeted Prostate Biopsy in the Era of Active Surveillance.', 'Surveillance Value of Apparent Diffusion Coefficient Maps: Multiparametric MRI in Active Surveillance of Prostate Cancer.', 'Cryotherapy for partial gland ablation of prostate cancer: Oncologic and safety outcomes.', 'Office-Based, Single-Sided, Low-Field MRI-Guided Prostate Biopsy.', 'Knowledge, attitudes, and practices of active surveillance in prostate cancer among urologists: a real-life survey from Brazil.', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging-guided Active Surveillance of Prostate Cancer: Time to Say Goodbye to Protocol-based Biopsies.']"""

Objective:   To compare coronary calcium score and cardiovascular MSU deposits detected by DECT in patients with gout and controls.  Design, setting, and participants:   This prospective Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act-compliant study included patients with gout and controls who presented to a rheumatologic clinic from January 1, 2017, to November 1, 2018. All consecutive patients underwent DECT to assess coronary calcium score and MSU deposits in aorta and coronary arteries. In addition, cadavers were assessed by DECT for cardiovascular MSU deposits and verified by polarizing microscope. Analysis began in January 2017.  Main outcomes and measures:   Detection rate of cardiovascular MSU deposits using DECT in patients with gout and control group patients without a previous history of gout or inflammatory rheumatic diseases.  Results:   A total of 59 patients with gout (mean [SD] age, 59 [5.7] years; range, 47-89 years), 47 controls (mean [SD] age, 70 [10.4] years; range, 44-86 years), and 6 cadavers (mean [SD] age at death, 76 [17] years; range, 56-95 years) were analyzed. The frequency of cardiovascular MSU deposits was higher among patients with gout (51 [86.4%]) compared with controls (7 [14.9%]) (χ2 = 17.68, P < .001), as well as coronary MSU deposits among patients with gout (19 [32.2%]) vs controls (2 [4.3%]) (χ2 = 8.97, P = .003). Coronary calcium score was significantly higher among patients with gout (900 Agatston units [AU]; 95% CI, 589-1211) compared with controls (263 AU; 95% CI, 76-451; P = .001) and also significantly higher among 58 individuals with cardiovascular MSU deposits (950 AU; 95% CI, 639-1261) compared with 48 individuals without MSU deposits (217 AU; 95% CI, 37-397; P < .001). Among 6 cadavers, 3 showed cardiovascular MSU deposits, which were verified by polarizing light microscope.  Conclusion and relevance:   Dual-energy computed tomography demonstrates cardiovascular MSU deposits, as confirmed by polarized light microscopy. Cardiovascular MSU deposits were detected by DECT significantly more often in patients with gout compared with controls and were associated with higher coronary calcium score.

However, an area for improvement still exists and a gap in cancer control needs to be filled by complementing FT with additional forms of treatment to minimize failures. Part of the recurrences/persistences after FT may be related to PCa microenvironment favouring tumorigenesis of benign tissue or indolent PCa left untreated. FT-induced inflammation may alter microenvironment in a pro-tumorigenic fashion. On the contrary, androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) modifies PCa microenvironment and suppresses PCa tumorigenesis. So far, ADT has proven effective in combination with radiotherapy, has been evaluated in the context of AS and to reduce prostate volume in the context of whole-gland high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU).

Methods:   At nine hospitals in Tohoku, Japan, the medical records of 605 consecutive patients with mHNPC who initially received ADT were retrospectively reviewed. The Pohar Perme estimator was used to calculate conditional net cancer-specific survival (CSS) and overall survival (OS) for up to 5 years subsequent to the diagnosis. Using multiple imputation, proportional hazard ratios for conditional CSS and OS were calculated with adjusted Cox regression models.  Results:   During a median follow up of 2.95 years, 208 patients died, of which 169 died due to progressive prostate cancer. At baseline, the 5-year CSS and OS rates were 65.5% and 58.2%, respectively. Conditional 5-year net CSS and OS survival gradually increased for all the patients. In patients given a 5-year survivorship, the conditional 5-year net CSS and OS rates improved to 0.906 and 0.811, respectively. Only the extent of disease score (EOD) ≥2 remained a prognostic factor for CSS and OS up to 5 years; as survival time increased, other variables were no longer independent prognostic factors.  Conclusions:   The conditional 5-year net CSS and OS in patients with mHNPC gradually increased; thus, the risk of mortality decreased with increasing survival. The patient's risk profile changed over time. EOD remained an independent prognostic factor for CSS and OS after 5-year follow-up.

Methods:   We investigated the use of IMRT for NPC using data from a nationwide cancer registry to describe the use of IMRT among NPC patients in Japan. We analyzed the data of patients with HNC, including NPC, who underwent IMRT between 2012 and 2014, as recorded in the hospital-based cancer registries linked with insurance claims. We calculated the proportion of patients with NPC who underwent IMRT at each hospital. To evaluate the use of IMRT for NPC, the IMRT use for NPC was compared with the proportion of patients with prostate cancer who underwent IMRT.  Results:   Among 508 patients with NPC who underwent RT at one of 87 hospitals, 348 (69%) underwent IMRT. This proportion gradually increased between 2012 and 2014 (62%, 64% and 77%).

This study aims to evaluate and compare DLMs (U-Net and generative adversarial network [GAN]) using various loss functions (L2, single-scale perceptual loss [PL], multiscale PL, weighted multiscale PL) and a patch-based method (PBM).  Methods and materials:   Thirty-nine patients received a volumetric modulated arc therapy for prostate cancer (78 Gy). T2-weighted MRIs were acquired in addition to planning CTs. The pCTs were generated from the MRIs using 7 configurations: 4 GANs (L2, single-scale PL, multiscale PL, weighted multiscale PL), 2 U-Net (L2 and single-scale PL), and the PBM. The imaging endpoints were mean absolute error and mean error, in Hounsfield units, between the reference CT (CTref) and the pCT. Dose uncertainties were quantified as mean absolute differences between the dose volume histograms (DVHs) calculated from the CTref and pCT obtained by each method. Three-dimensional gamma indexes were analyzed.  Results:   Considering the image uncertainties in the whole pelvis, GAN L2 and U-Net L2 showed the lowest mean absolute error (≤34.4 Hounsfield units). The mean errors were not different than 0 (P ≤ .05). The PBM provided the highest uncertainties. Very few DVH points differed when comparing GAN L2 or U-Net L2 DVHs and CTref DVHs (P ≤ .05). Their dose uncertainties were ≤0.6% for the prostate planning target Volume V95%, ≤0.5% for the rectum V70Gy, and ≤0.1% for the bladder V50Gy. The PBM, U-Net PL, and GAN PL presented the highest systematic dose uncertainties. The gamma pass rates were >99% for all DLMs. The mean calculation time to generate 1 pCT was 15 s for the DLMs and 62 min for the PBM.  Conclusions:   Generating pCT for MRI dose planning with DLMs and PBM provided low-dose uncertainties. In particular, the GAN L2 and U-Net L2 provided the lowest dose uncertainties together with a low computation time.""","""['Axel Largent', 'Anaïs Barateau', 'Jean-Claude Nunes', 'Eugenia Mylona', 'Joël Castelli', 'Caroline Lafond', 'Peter B Greer', 'Jason A Dowling', 'John Baxter', 'Hervé Saint-Jalmes', 'Oscar Acosta', 'Renaud de Crevoisier']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys""","""['Pseudo-CT Generation for MRI-Only Radiation Therapy Treatment Planning: Comparison Among Patch-Based, Atlas-Based, and Bulk Density Methods.', 'A high-performance method of deep learning for prostate MR-only radiotherapy planning using an optimized Pix2Pix architecture.', 'Feasibility of MRI-only treatment planning for proton therapy in brain and prostate cancers: Dose calculation accuracy in substitute CT images.', 'Deep learning methods to generate synthetic CT from MRI in radiotherapy: A literature review.', 'Deep Learning in Radiation Oncology Treatment Planning for Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Review.', 'Artificial intelligence applications in prostate cancer.', 'Deep Learning in MRI-guided Radiation Therapy: A Systematic Review.', 'Synthetic computed tomography generation for abdominal adaptive radiotherapy using low-field magnetic resonance imaging.', 'Quality assurance for MRI-only radiation therapy: A voxel-wise population-based methodology for image and dose assessment of synthetic CT generation methods.', 'Synthetic CT generation for MRI-guided adaptive radiotherapy in prostate cancer.']"""

Identification of cancer-derived mediators of bone metastasis and osteolysis may lead to novel therapeutic strategies. In this study, we established highly bone-metastatic PC3 prostate and MDA-MB-231 (MDA) breast cancer cell sublines by in vivo selection in mice. In bone-metastatic cancer cells, the expression and secretion of connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) were highly upregulated. CTGF knockdown in bone-metastatic cells decreased invasion activity and MMP expression. RUNX2 overexpression in the CTGF knockdown cells restored the invasion activity and MMP expression. In addition, CTGF increased RUNX2 protein stability by inducing its acetylation via p300 acetyl transferase. The integrin αvβ3 receptor mediated these effects of CTGF. Furthermore, CTGF promoted RUNX2 recruitment to the RANKL promoter, resulting in increased RANKL production from the tumor cells and subsequent stimulation of osteoclastogenesis from precursor cells. In addition, animal model with injection of CTGF knocked-down prostate cancer cells into 6-week old BALB/c male mice showed reduced osteolytic lesions. More importantly, the expression levels of CTGF and RANKL showed a strong positive correlation in human primary breast tumor tissues and were higher in bone metastases than in other site metastases. These findings indicate that CTGF plays crucial roles for osteolytic bone metastasis both by enhancing invasiveness of tumor cells and by producing RANKL for osteoclastogenesis. Targeting CTGF may lead to the development of effective preventive and therapeutic strategies for osteolytic metastasis. © 2019 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.""","""['Bongjun Kim', 'Haemin Kim', 'Suhan Jung', 'Aree Moon', 'Dong-Young Noh', 'Zang Hee Lee', 'Hyung Joon Kim', 'Hong-Hee Kim']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""J Bone Miner Res""","""['Integrin αvβ3 and CD44 pathways in metastatic prostate cancer cells support osteoclastogenesis via a Runx2/Smad 5/receptor activator of NF-κB ligand signaling axis.', 'Runx2 association with progression of prostate cancer in patients: mechanisms mediating bone osteolysis and osteoblastic metastatic lesions.', 'RANKL acts directly on RANK-expressing prostate tumor cells and mediates migration and expression of tumor metastasis genes.', 'The role of osteoclastic activity in prostate cancer skeletal metastases.', 'Regulatory roles of Runx2 in metastatic tumor and cancer cell interactions with bone.', 'SPARC accelerates biliary tract cancer progression through CTGF-mediated tumor-stroma interactions: SPARC as a prognostic marker of survival after neoadjuvant therapy.', 'The relationship between the Hippo signaling pathway and bone metastasis of breast cancer.', 'Animal models of cancer metastasis to the bone.', 'Role of RUNX2 in breast cancer development and drug resistance (Review).', 'RUNX2 promotes the suppression of osteoblast function and enhancement of osteoclast activity by multiple myeloma cells.']"""

Objective:   To assess sex hormones, IGF1, glucose, and advanced glycation end products (AGEs) as potential mediators of the association between diabetes mellitus and prostate cancer.  Design and participants:   Longitudinal cohort study. The association of baseline diabetes with prostate cancer incidence was assessed using proportional hazards competing risks analysis in 3149 men followed for 12 years.

Results:   Diabetes was associated with a lower prostate cancer risk (fully adjusted subhazard ratio, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.43 to 0.92; P = 0.017). This association was unchanged after accounting for testosterone, DHT, estradiol, or SHBG. Similarly, the addition of IGF1 or its binding proteins 1 and 3, or glucose, did not alter this association. CML was not associated with the risk of prostate cancer, and additional correction for CML in the fully adjusted model did not alter the inverse association of diabetes and prostate cancer risk.

Methods:   We carried out a record-linkage cohort study based on the 2011 Italian census and the mortality archives (2012-2015), including 1 068 653 construction workers. We estimated mortality rate ratios (MRR) using Poisson regression models including terms for age and geographic area.  Results:   Compared with non-manual workers, construction workers showed an excess mortality from all causes (MRR: 1.34), all neoplasms (MRR: 1.30), head and neck (MRR: 2.05), stomach (MRR: 1.56), liver (MRR: 1.62), lung (MRR: 1.80), prostate (MRR: 1.24) and bladder (MRR: 1.60) cancers, respiratory (MRR: 1.41) and liver (MRR: 1.79) diseases, all external causes (MRR: 1.87), falls (MRR: 2.87) and suicide (MRR: 1.58).

Combining large genomics and molecular data sources with powerful deep learning techniques has the potential to revolutionize predictive biology. In this study, we present Deep gene COmpound Profiler (DeepCOP), a deep learning based model that can predict gene regulating effects of low-molecular weight compounds. This model can be used for direct identification of a drug candidate causing a desired gene expression response, without utilizing any information on its interactions with protein target(s).  Results:   In this study, we successfully combined molecular fingerprint descriptors and gene descriptors (derived from gene ontology terms) to train deep neural networks that predict differential gene regulation endpoints collected in LINCS database. We achieved 10-fold cross-validation RAUC scores of and above 0.80, as well as enrichment factors of >5. We validated our models using an external RNA-Seq dataset generated in-house that described the effect of three potent antiandrogens (with different modes of action) on gene expression in LNCaP prostate cancer cell line. The results of this pilot study demonstrate that deep learning models can effectively synergize molecular and genomic descriptors and can be used to screen for novel drug candidates with the desired effect on gene expression. We anticipate that such models can find a broad use in developing novel cancer therapeutics and can facilitate precision oncology efforts.

Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) has become a standard treatment strategy for advanced PCa. Although a majority of patients initially respond to ADT well, most of them will eventually develop castration-resistant PCa (CRPC). Previous studies suggest that ADT-induced changes in the immune microenvironment (mE) in PCa might be responsible for the failures of various therapies. However, the role of the immune system in CRPC development remains unclear. To systematically understand the immunity leading to CRPC progression and predict the optimal treatment strategy in silico, we developed a 3D Hybrid Multi-scale Model (HMSM), consisting of an ODE system and an agent-based model (ABM), to manipulate the tumor growth in a defined immune system. Based on our analysis, we revealed that the key factors (e.g. WNT5A, TRAIL, CSF1, etc.) mediated the activation of PC-Treg and PC-TAM interaction pathways, which induced the immunosuppression during CRPC progression.

Recently, AR splice variant 7 (ARv7) has been implicated in advanced stages of PRCA and clinical recurrence. With the widespread use of AR-targeted therapies, there has been a rising interest in the expression of full-length AR and ARv7 in PRCA progression and how these receptors, both independently and together, contribute to adverse clinicopathologic outcomes.  Methods:   Despite a multitude of studies measuring the expression levels of AR and ARv7 in PRCA progression, the results have been inconsistent and sometimes contradictory due to technical and analytical discrepancies. To circumvent these inconsistencies, we used an automated multiplexed immunostaining platform for full-length AR and ARv7 in human PRCA samples and objectively quantified expression changes with machine learning-based software. With this technology, we can assess receptor prevalence both independently, and coexpressed, within specific tissue and cellular compartments.  Results:   Full-length AR and ARv7 expression increased in epithelial nuclei of metastatic samples compared to benign. Interestingly, a population of cells with undetectable AR persisted through all stages of PRCA progression. Coexpression analyses showed an increase of the double-positive (AR+ /ARv7+ ) population in metastases compared to benign, and an increase of the double-negative population in PRCA samples compared to benign. Importantly, analysis of clinicopathologic outcomes associated with AR/ARv7 coexpression showed a significant decrease in the double-positive population with higher Gleason score (GS), as well as in samples with recurrence in under 5 years. Conversely, the double-negative population was significantly increased in samples with higher GS and in samples with recurrence in under 5 years.  Conclusions:   Changes in AR and ARv7 coexpression may have prognostic value in PRCA progression and recurrence. A better understanding of the prevalence and clinicopathologic outcomes associated with changes in these receptors' coexpression may provide a foundation for improved diagnosis and therapy for men with PRCA.""","""['Jordan E Vellky', 'Tyler M Bauman', 'Emily A Ricke', 'Wei Huang', 'William A Ricke']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Tissue-specific quantification and localization of androgen and estrogen receptors in prostate cancer.', 'Androgen receptor splice variant 7 functions independently of the full length receptor in prostate cancer cells.', 'High level of androgen receptor is associated with aggressive clinicopathologic features and decreased biochemical recurrence-free survival in prostate: cancer patients treated with radical prostatectomy.', 'Androgen receptor splice variants and prostate cancer: From bench to bedside.', 'Androgen action in the prostate gland.', 'Predictive factors for the efficacy of abiraterone acetate therapy in high-risk metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer patients.', 'Understanding and targeting prostate cancer cell heterogeneity and plasticity.', 'RNA-binding protein DDX3 mediates posttranscriptional regulation of androgen receptor: A mechanism of castration resistance.', 'Development and prevalence of castration-resistant prostate cancer subtypes.', 'Resveratrol inhibits proliferation and promotes apoptosis via the androgen receptor splicing variant 7 and PI3K/AKT signaling pathway in LNCaP prostate cancer cells.']"""

Notably, pure low-grade cancers, comprised predominantly of Gleason pattern 3 (G3) are typically indolent, with lethal potential emerging with the progression of higher-grade Gleason patterns 4 (G4) or 5. One of the hallmarks of more aggressive cancer phenotypes is the stereotyped set of metabolic characteristics that transformed cells acquire to facilitate unregulated growth. In the present study, we profiled expression signatures of metabolic genes that are differentially expressed between G3 and G4 cancer foci and investigated the functional role of two of the profiled genes, PGRMC1 and HSD17B4, in prostate cancer cells.  Methods:   Gene expression profiling was conducted using 32 G3 and 32 G4 cancer foci from patients with 3+3 and ≥4+3 tumors, respectively. A 95-gene Nanostring probe set was used to probe genes associated with energy metabolism. Two out of five genes (PGRMC1 and HSD17B4) that significantly distinguish between G3 and G4 were functionally validated in vitro using established prostate cancer cells (PC3, DU145). Expression of PGRMC1 and HSD17B4 was knocked down and subsequent studies were performed to analyze cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and apoptosis. Mechanistic studies that explored the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) pathway were performed by Western blot.  Results:   Multivariate analysis identified five metabolic genes that were differentially expressed between G3 and G4 stroma (P < .05). Functional validation studies revealed that knockdown of PGRMC1 and HSD17B4 significantly decreased cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, and increased apoptosis in PC3 and DU145 cells. Mechanistic studies showed that these effects, after PGRMC1 knockdown, were possibly mediated through alterations in downstream components of the EGFR, protein kinase B, and nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells pathways.

To our knowledge the role of multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging and targeted biopsy for elevated prostate specific antigen in this population has not been assessed. We sought to define imaging and targeted biopsy outcomes in Asian American men compared to other men.  Materials and methods:   We accrued a multicenter, prospective cohort of men who underwent magnetic resonance imaging targeted and systematic biopsy for elevated prostate specific antigen. The outcome of interest was a diagnosis of clinically significant prostate cancer (Gleason Grade Group 2 or greater) stratified by the PI-RADS™ (Prostate Imaging-Reporting and Data System) score and a history of negative biopsy. Multivariable logistic regression was used to assess the effect of Asian American race on cancer detection.  Results:   Of the 2,571 men 275 (11%) were Asian American. Clinically significant prostate cancer was detected in 37% of Asian American men compared to 48% of men of other races (p <0.001). Asian American men were also less likely to be diagnosed with Grade Group 1 cancer (12% vs 18%, p=0.007). Additionally, there was significantly lower detection of significant cancer using PI-RADS 3 in Asian American men vs men of other races (12% vs 21%, p=0.032). On adjusted analysis Asian American men were less likely to be diagnosed with significant cancer (OR 0.57, 95% CI 0.42-0.79, p <0.001) and Grade Group 1 cancer (OR 0.57, 95% CI 0.38-0.84, p=0.005) than nonAsian men.

We examined the association of PTEN/ERG status with lethal prostate cancer in patients treated with radical prostatectomy.  Materials and methods:   Included in analysis were 791 patients with clinically localized prostate cancer treated with radical prostatectomy at a single institution. Genetically validated immunohistochemistry assays for PTEN and ERG were performed on tissue microarrays. Multivariable Cox proportional hazard models were used to assess the association of PTEN/ERG status with lethal prostate cancer (defined as metastasis or prostate cancer specific death), adjusting for patient age, race, pathological grade and stage, and surgical margin status.  Results:   Median followup in the cohort was 12.8 years. Of 791 cases 203 (25%) demonstrated PTEN loss and 330 of 776 (43%) were ERG positive. On multivariable analysis PTEN loss (HR 1.9, 95% CI 1.2-3.0, p=0.012) but not ERG expression (HR 0.6, 95% CI 0.4-1.1, p=0.11) was associated with an increased risk of lethal prostate cancer.

Purpose To compare the diagnostic accuracy and interrater agreement of multiparametric MRI and 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/MRI for the detection of extracapsular extension (ECE) and seminal vesicle infiltration (SVI) in patients with prostate cancer. Materials and Methods Retrospective analysis of 40 consecutive men who underwent multiparametric MRI and 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/MRI within 6 months for suspected prostate cancer followed by radical prostatectomy between April 2016 and July 2018. Four readers blinded to clinical and histopathologic findings rated the probability of ECE and SVI at multiparametric MRI and PET/MRI by using a five-point Likert-type scale. The prostatectomy specimen served as the reference standard. Accuracy was assessed with a multireader multicase analysis and by calculating reader-average areas under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUCs), sensitivity, and specificity for ordinal and dichotomized data in a region-specific and patient-specific approach. Interrater agreement was assessed with the Fleiss multirater κ. Results For multiparametric MRI versus PET/MRI in ECE detection, respectively, AUC, sensitivity, and specificity in the region-specific analysis were 0.67 and 0.75 (P = .07), 28% (21 of 76) and 47% (36 of 76) (P = .09), and 94% (529 of 564) and 90% (509 of 564) (P = .007). For the patient-specific analysis, AUC, sensitivity, and specificity were 0.66 and 0.73 (P = .19), 46% (22 of 48) and 69% (33 of 48) (P = .04), and 75% (84 of 112) and 67% (75 of 112) (P = .19), respectively. For multiparametric MRI versus PET/MRI in SVI detection, respectively, AUC, sensitivity, and specificity of the region-specific analysis were 0.66 and 0.74 (P = .21), 35% (seven of 20) and 50% (10 of 20) (P = .25), and 98% (295 of 300) and 94% (282 of 300) (P < .001). For the patient-specific analysis, AUC, sensitivity, and specificity were 0.65 and 0.79 (P = .25), 35% (seven of 20) and 55% (11 of 20) (P = .20), and 98% (137 of 140) and 94% (131 of 140) (P = .07), respectively. Interrater reliability for multiparametric MRI versus PET/MRI did not differ for ECE (κ, 0.46 vs 0.40; P = .24) and SVI (κ, 0.23 vs 0.33; P = .39). Conclusion Our results suggest that gallium 68 (68Ga)-labeled Glu-urea-Lys (Ahx)-HBED-CC ligand targeting the prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) (68Ga-PSMA-11) PET/MRI and multiparametric MRI perform similarly for local staging of prostate cancer in patients with intermediate-to-high-risk prostate cancer.

Twenty percent of patients receiving the standard of care androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) eventually progress to metastatic and incurable castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Current FDA-approved drugs for CRPC target androgen receptor (AR) binding or androgen production, but only provide a 2- to 5-month survival benefit due to the emergence of resistance. Overexpression of AR coactivators and the emergence of AR splice variants, both promote continued transcriptional activation under androgen-depleted conditions and represent drug resistance mechanisms that contribute to CRPC progression. The AR contains two transactivation domains, activation function 2 (AF-2) and activation function 1 (AF-1), which serve as binding surfaces for coactivators involved in the transcriptional activation of AR target genes. Full-length AR contains both AF-2 and AF-1 surfaces, whereas AR splice variants only have an AF-1 surface. We have recently prosecuted a high-content screening campaign to identify hit compounds that can inhibit or disrupt the protein-protein interactions (PPIs) between AR and transcriptional intermediary factor 2 (TIF2), one of the coactivators implicated in CRPC disease progression. Since an ideal inhibitor/disruptor of AR-coactivator PPIs would target both the AF-2 and AF-1 surfaces, we describe here the development and validation of five AF-2- and three AF-1-focused assays to interrogate and prioritize hits that disrupt both transactivation surfaces. The assays were validated using a test set of seven known AR modulator compounds, including three AR antagonists and one androgen synthesis inhibitor that are FDA-approved ADTs, two investigational molecules that target the N-terminal domain of AR, and an inhibitor of the Hsp90 (heat shock protein) molecular chaperone.""","""['Ashley T Fancher', 'Yun Hua', 'Christopher J Strock', 'Paul A Johnston']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Assay Drug Dev Technol""","""['High-Content Screening Campaign to Identify Compounds That Inhibit or Disrupt Androgen Receptor-Transcriptional Intermediary Factor 2 Protein-Protein Interactions for the Treatment of Prostate Cancer.', 'Sintokamide A Is a Novel Antagonist of Androgen Receptor That Uniquely Binds Activation Function-1 in Its Amino-terminal Domain.', 'Targeting Androgen Receptor Activation Function-1 with EPI to Overcome Resistance Mechanisms in Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Androgen receptor-dependent and -independent mechanisms driving prostate cancer progression: Opportunities for therapeutic targeting from multiple angles.', 'Androgen receptors in hormone-dependent and castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'The Role of Androgens and Androgen Receptor in Human Bladder Cancer.']"""

Cisplatin, also known as cis-diamminedichloroplatinum (DDP), is a standard chemotherapeutic agent used to treat PCa, and DDP resistance remains one important obstacle in DDP-based chemotherapy. In our research, we found miR-425-5p was down-regulated in PCa and even lower in DDP-resistant PCa determined by quantitative polymerase chain reaction; in contrast, GSK3β mRNA expression was upregulated in PCa and even higher in DDP-resistant PCa. Moreover, there was a modest but significant inverse correlation between the expression of GSK3β mRNA and miR-425-5p. Functional experiments showed that miR-425-5p mimic inhibited DDP resistance as evidenced by a promoted apoptosis rate (flow cytometry) and suppressed cell viability (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay) and expressions of MDR1 andMRP1 (western blotting) in DU145/DDP and PC3/DDP cells. Luciferase reporter assay and RNA immunoprecipitation identifiedGSK3β was a potential target of miR-425-5p. The effect ofmiR-425-5pmimic on DDP resistance was partially reversed by pcDNA-GSK3β. Mechanically, miR-425-5p mimic reduced expression of β-catenin, cyclin D1 and C-myc, which was further blocked when GSK3β overexpressed. In vivo experiments, recovery of GSK3β prevented xenograft tumor growth and DDP resistance in the presence of miR-425-5p mimic.

DOTA is one of the most widely used macrocyclic ligands for the development of new metal-based imaging and therapeutic agents owing to its ability to form stable and inert complexes under physiological conditions. Although solid-phase synthesis compatible DOTA-tris-(t-Bu ester) is a commercial product, it is expensive and contain chemical impurities. There is a need to explore new and cost-effective methods for the preparation of metal chelating agents, i.e., DOTA, directly on solid support to facilitate rapid, cost-effective, and high purity preparation of DOTA-linked peptides for imaging and therapy. In the present study, we describe a facile synthetic strategy of DOTA preparation and its linkage to peptides directly on solid-phase support.  Methods:   Bombesin (BN) peptides were functionalized with DOTA chelator prepared from cyclen precursor on solid-phase and from commercial DOTA-tris and radiolabeled with 68Ga. In vitro BN/GRP receptor binding affinities of the corresponding radiolabeled peptides were determined by saturation binding assays on human breast MDA-MB-231, MCF7, T47D, and PC3 prostate cancer cells. Pharmacokinetics were studied in Balb/c mice and in vivo tumor targeting in MDA-MB-231 tumor-bearing nude mice.  Results:   DOTA was prepared successfully from cyclen on solid-phase support, linked specifically to BN peptides and resultant DOTA-coupled peptides were radiolabeled efficiently with 68Ga. The binding affinities of all the six BN peptides were comparable and in the low nanomolar range. All 68Ga-labeled peptides showed high metabolic stability in plasma. These radiopeptides exhibited rapid pharmacokinetics in Balb/c mice with excretion mainly through the urinary system. In nude mice, MDA-MB-231 tumor uptake profiles were slightly different; the BN peptide with Ahx spacer and linked to DOTA through cyclen exhibited higher tumor uptake (2.32% ID/g at 1 h post-injection) than other radiolabeled BN peptides investigated in this study. The same leading BN peptide also displayed favorable pharmacokinetic profile in Balb/c mice. The PET images clearly visualized the MDA-MB-231 tumor.  Conclusions:   DOTA prepared from cyclen on solid-phase support showed comparable potency and efficiency to DOTA-tris in both in vitro and in vivo evaluation. The synthetic methodology described here allows versatile, site-specific introduction of DOTA into peptides to facilitate the development of DOTA-linked molecular imaging and therapy agents for clinical translation.""","""['Subhani M Okarvi', 'Ibrahim AlJammaz']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""EJNMMI Res""","""['Synthesis and evaluation of a technetium-99m labeled cytotoxic bombesin peptide conjugate for targeting bombesin receptor-expressing tumors.', 'A comparative PET imaging study of 44gSc- and 68Ga-labeled bombesin antagonist BBN2 derivatives in breast and prostate cancer models.', 'Preparation and evaluation of bombesin peptide derivatives as potential tumor imaging agents: effects of structure and composition of amino acid sequence on in vitro and in vivo characteristics.', 'Current State of Radiolabeled Heterobivalent Peptidic Ligands in Tumor Imaging and Therapy.', 'Research Progress Evaluating the Function and Mechanism of Anti-Tumor Peptides.', 'Radiometallation and photo-triggered release of ready-to-inject radiopharmaceuticals from the solid phase.', 'Peptide-based positron emission tomography probes: current strategies for synthesis and radiolabelling.', 'Advances in Development of Radiometal Labeled Amino Acid-Based Compounds for Cancer Imaging and Diagnostics.']"""

We investigated the performance of 99mTc-MIP-1404 PSMA SPECT/CT in the detection of PSMA-positive tumor lesions in patients suffering from biochemical recurrence of prostate cancer presenting with serum levels of the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) below 1 ng/mL.  Methods:   We retrospectively analyzed 99mTc-MIP-1404-SPECT/CT scans of 50 patients (25 with low PSA levels between > 0.5 and 1 ng/mL and 25 with very low PSA levels between 0.2 and 0.5 ng/mL) that had undergone whole-body planar scintigraphy and SPECT/CT of the thorax, abdomen and pelvis 3-4 h p.i. of 691 ± 72 MBq 99mTc-MIP-1404. All datasets were evaluated for the presence and location of PSMA-positive tumor lesions, in which maximal standardized uptake values (SUVmax) were also measured. Based on the results of the quantitative evaluation as well as on biochemical and histological parameters, predictive factors for a positive 99mTc-MIP-1404 scan result were determined. The influence of 99mTc-MIP-1404 PSMA SPECT/CT on further therapy planning was assessed, based on the decision-making of the interdisciplinary tumor board.  Results:   Pathological 99mTc-MIP-1404 uptake was detected in a total of 25 patients (50%). In the very low PSA subgroup, detection rates of PSMA-positive lesions suggestive of tumor recurrence were 44%, in the low-PSA subgroup 56%. Gleason scores ≥ 8 and the presence of antiandrogen deprivation therapy were further significant predictors of pathological 99mTc-MIP-1404 uptake. This was paralleled by significantly higher lesional SUVmax patients with PSA levels > 0.5 ng/mL and Gleason scores ≥ 8 compared to those without these two features.

Methods:   A total of 116 consecutive patients with BPH were randomized to be treated surgically with either HoLEP (n = 58) or ThuLEP (n = 58), following the classical three-lobe enucleation technique. Follow-up was assessed at 1, 3, 6, 12 and 18 months after surgery.

However, it only provides a temporary response and modest increase in survival, indicating a rapid evolution of resistance. Previous studies suggest that enzalutamide may function as a partial transcriptional agonist, but the underlying mechanisms for enzalutamide-induced transcription remain poorly understood. Here, we show that enzalutamide stimulates expression of a novel subset of genes distinct from androgen-responsive genes. Treatment of prostate cancer cells with enzalutamide enhances recruitment of pioneer factor GATA2, AR, Mediator subunits MED1 and MED14, and RNA Pol II to regulatory elements of enzalutamide-responsive genes. Mechanistically, GATA2 globally directs enzalutamide-induced transcription by facilitating AR, Mediator and Pol II loading to enzalutamide-responsive gene loci. Importantly, the GATA2 inhibitor K7174 inhibits enzalutamide-induced transcription by decreasing binding of the GATA2/AR/Mediator/Pol II transcriptional complex, contributing to sensitization of prostate cancer cells to enzalutamide treatment.

Particle beam therapy(PBT)using protons and carbonions have physical advantages in RT for the treatment of various cancers because they can create a desirable dose distribution to the target volume using fewer portals compared with photon-based RT. Thus, dose-escalation using charged particles is a reasonable approach in RT, theoretically. Based on accumulation of the evidences that PBT shows the efficacy in treatment for several cancers, the number of particle therapy facilities have been rapidly increasing worldwide. The Japanese Society for Radiation Oncology organized a joint effort among research groups to establish standardized treatment policies of particle therapy according to disease through systematic reviews. Furthermore, multicenter prospective studies have been conducted for hepatocellular carcinoma and prostate cancer. At the present, PBT for pediatric tumors, prostate cancer, unresectable bone and soft tissue sarcomas, head and neck non-squamous cell carcinomas is covered by the Japanese national health insurance system.

Moreover, the existing evidence is often affected by lead-time bias. We sought to address this gap in a cohort of 1458 PCa patients undergoing SRT for biochemical recurrence (BCR) after RP in two tertiary care centers between 1992 and 2013. Using a quasi-randomized study design known as regression discontinuity (RD) and adjusting for lead-time bias, we compared metastasis-free survival (MFS) at 5 and 10 years after surgery between eSRT (prostate-specific antigen [PSA] <0.5 ng/ml) and lSRT (PSA ≥ 0.5 ng/ml). Overall, 1049 patients (71.9%) underwent eSRT and 409 (28.1%) lSRT at a mean follow-up of 84 mo (interquartile range (IQR) 52-120.4). The MFS rate decreased nonsignificantly at the proposed cutoff by 0.04 (95% confidence interval [CI]: -0.06 to 0.19) at 5 years and by 0.07 (95% CI: - 0.12 to 0.32) at 10 years.

In conclusion, in a quasirandomized study design accounting for lead-time bias, eSRT (PSA < 0.5 ng/ml) did not improve MFS. Our results underline the need for level-one evidence to compare eSRT and lSRT.

It has been shown that performing biopsy only for men with bpMRI Likert scores of 4-5 or PSAd ≥0.15 ng/ml/cm3 is the most efficient strategy.  Objective:   To externally validate previously published biopsy strategies using two prospective bpMRI trial cohorts.  Design, setting, and participants:   After IMPROD bpMRI, 499 men had systematic transrectal prostate biopsies and men with IMPROD bpMRI Likert scores of 3-5 had an additional two to four targeted biopsies.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Various IMPROD bpMRI Likert score and PSAd thresholds were assessed using detection rates for significant prostate cancer (sPCa; Gleason score ≥3 + 4), predictive values, and proportion of biopsies avoided. Net benefits and decision curve analyses (DCA) were compared with the aim of finding an optimal strategy for sPCa detection. Combined biopsies were used for reference.  Results and limitations:   The negative predictive value (NPV) for sPCa in IMPROD bpMRI Likert 3-5 and 4-5 score groups was 93% and 92%, respectively, while the corresponding positive predictive value (PPV) was 57% and 72%, respectively. In DCA, the optimal combination was IMPROD bpMRI Likert score 4-5 or Likert 3 with PSAd ≥0.20 ng/ml/cm3, which had NPV of 93% and PPV of 67%. Using this combination, 35% of the study patients would have avoided biopsies and 13 sPCas (6%, 13/229, of all sPCas diagnosed) would have been missed.  Conclusions:   IMPROD bpMRI demonstrated a good NPV for sPCa. PSAd improved the NPV mainly among men with equivocal suspicion on IMPROD bpMRI. However, the additional value of PSAd was marginal: the NPV and PPV for IMPROD bpMRI Likert 4-5 score group were 92% and 72%, respectively, while the corresponding values for the best combination strategy were 93% and 67%.

However, the cross-talks between tumor epithelial cell, stromal cells, and immune cells are yet to be fully elucidated. The present study aims to determine the role of chemokine and neutrophil derived cytokine paracrine axis in mediating the interaction between tumor cells, stromal myofibroblasts, and neutrophils in the tumor microenvironment of prostate cancer.  Methods:   To identify myofibroblasts and neutrophil derived specific proteins affecting progression of prostate cancer, bioinformatics analyses were firstly performed in independent human prostate cancer gene expression data sets from the GEO data bank. Expression of stromal myofibroblasts secretory chemokine CXCL1 and neutrophil derived cytokine LCN2 was evaluated in prostate tissues via immunohistochemistry assay. We further investigated the effect of CXCL1 and LCN2 on prostate cancer using in vivo and in vitro models, and explored the underlying signal transduction pathways.  Results:   A CXCL1-LCN2 paracrine network was confirmed in prostate cancer tissue samples, which was correlated with the biochemical recurrence of prostate cancer. Of note, CXCL1-LCN2 axis activates Src signaling, triggers the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), consequently promotes the migration of prostate cancer cells, leading to enhanced tumor metastasis.  Conclusions:   Our findings may provide enhanced insight into the interactions of carcinoma-stromal cells and immune cells linked to prostate cancer progression, wherein CXCL1-LCN2 axis is a key contributor to prostate cancer cells migration.

Using 14 mm as cut off for LN, median TBR was 10.8 months for patients with small LN (18 patients), and 21.2 months for patients with large LN (6 patients) (P unadjusted = 0.009; P adjusted = 0.099). ADT was started in 32% of patients after a median follow-up of 18 months.  Conclusions:   For PCa patients with 1-3 LN recurrence after RP (± salvage RT), SBRT might result in a better biochemical control when delivered to larger sized (≥ 14 mm) LN metastases.

New imaging-modalities have increased the diagnosed patients with limited number of metastasis after primary curative therapy, introducing so-called oligometastatic state. Stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) is emerging as a low-toxicity treatment to erase PCa localizations and postpone androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). A deeper understanding of the predictive role of biomarkers is desirable for a targeted treatment selection and surveillance programs. The aims of the RADIOSA trial are: 1. Compare SBRT +/- ADT for oligorecurrent-castration-sensitive PCa (OCS-PCa) in terms of efficacy, toxicity and Quality of Life (QoL). 2. Develop biology/imaging based prognostic tool that allows identifying OCS-PCa subclasses.  Methods:   This is a randomized phase II clinical trial, recruiting 160 OCS-PCa in 3 years, with progression-free survival (PFS) as primary endpoint. Three tasks will be developed: 1. Randomized clinical study (3 years for accrual and 2 years for follow-up and data analysis); 2. Imaging study, including imaging registration and METastasis Reporting and Data System (MET-RADS) criteria; 3. Pre-clinical study, development of a biobank of blood samples for the analysis of neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio and preparatory for a subsequent miRNA profiling. We aim to determine which arm is justified for testing in a subsequent Phase III trial. A decision-tree algorithm, based on prognosis, biological phenotype and imaging profile, will be developed.  Discussion:   Recruiting will start in July 2019. SBRT will allow obtaining excellent PFS, local control, QoL and low toxicity. In SBRT arm, ADT deferral will allow for a drug-holiday, delaying the detrimental impact on QoL. A sufficient number of blood samples will be collected to perform biological patient profiling. A stratification tool will be established with an analysis of morphological and functional imaging, based on the use of MET-RADS criteria. So, in conclusion, RADIOSA aims to define the optimal management of bone/nodal PCa relapses in a SBRT regimen. This study will increase our knowledge on low-burden metastatic PCa in the era of high precision and high technology personalized medicine, offering highly effective therapy in terms of clinical outcome and cost-effectiveness.

STAT3 protein mediates some of these pathways and its activation is implicated in the modulation of several metabolic enzymes. A bioinformatic analysis indicated a STAT3 binding site in the upstream region of SHMT2 gene. We demonstrated that in LNCaP, PCa cells' SHMT2 expression is upregulated by the JAK2/STAT3 canonical pathway upon IL-6 stimulation. Activation of SHTM2 leads to a decrease in serine levels, pushing PKM2 towards the nuclear compartment where it can activate STAT3 in a non-canonical fashion that in turn promotes a transient shift toward anaerobic metabolism. These results were also confirmed on FFPE prostate tissue sections at different Gleason scores. STAT3/SHMT2/PKM2 loop in LNCaP cells can modulate a metabolic shift in response to inflammation at early stages of cancer progression, whereas a non-canonical STAT3 activation involving the STAT3/HIF-1α/PKM2 loop is responsible for the maintenance of Warburg effect distinctive of more aggressive PCa cells.

Most recent approaches have utilized heterogeneous information about miRNAs and diseases, including miRNA similarities, disease similarities, and miRNA-disease associations. However, these methods do not utilize the projections of miRNAs and diseases in a low-dimensional space. Thus, it is necessary to develop a method that can utilize the effective information in the low-dimensional space to predict potential disease-related miRNA candidates. We proposed a method based on non-negative matrix factorization, named DMAPred, to predict potential miRNA-disease associations. DMAPred exploits the similarities and associations of diseases and miRNAs, and it integrates local topological information of the miRNA network. The likelihood that a miRNA is associated with a disease also depends on their projections in low-dimensional space. Therefore, we project miRNAs and diseases into low-dimensional feature space to yield their low-dimensional and dense feature representations. Moreover, the sparse characteristic of miRNA-disease associations was introduced to make our predictive model more credible. DMAPred achieved superior performance for 15 well-characterized diseases with AUCs (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve) ranging from 0.860 to 0.973 and AUPRs (area under the precision-recall curve) ranging from 0.118 to 0.761.

These models often contain large sets of parameters and rely on limited data sets for validation. The quantitative analysis of the dynamics of prostate cancer under treatment may be hindered by the lack of identifiability of the parameters from the available data, which limits the predictive ability of the model. Using three ordinary differential equation models as case studies, we carry out a numerical investigation of the identifiability and uncer- tainty quantification of the model parameters. In most cases, the parameters are not identifiable from time series of prostate-specific antigen, which is used as a clinical proxy for tumor progression. It may not be possible to define a finite confidence bound on an unidentifiable parameter, and the relative uncertainties in even identifiable parameters may be large in some cases. The Fisher information ma- trix may be used to determine identifiable parameter subsets for a given model. The use of biological constraints and additional types of measurements, should they become available, may reduce these uncertainties. Ensemble Kalman filtering may provide clinically useful, short-term predictions of pa- tient outcomes from imperfect models, though care must be taken when estimating ""patient-specific"" parameters.

The decision to perform an ePLND can be challenging because the overall incidence of lymph node metastasis is relatively low and ePLND is not free of complications. Using current clinical nomograms to identify patients with nodal involvement, approximately 75-85% of ePLNDs performed are negative. The aim of this study was to assess the added value of 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET in predicting lymph node metastasis in men with intermediate- or high-risk prostate cancer.  Methods: 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET scans of 60 patients undergoing radical prostatectomy with ePLND were reviewed for qualitative (visual) assessment of suspicious nodes and assessment of quantitative parameters of the primary tumour in the prostate (SUVmax, total activity (PSMAtotal) and PSMA positive volume (PSMAvol)). Ability of quantitative PET parameters to predict nodal metastasis was assessed with receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis. A multivariable logistic regression model combining PSA, Gleason score, visual nodal status on PET and primary tumour PSMAtotal was built. Net benefit at each risk threshold was compared with five nomograms: MSKCC nomogram, Yale formula, Roach formula, Winter nomogram and Partin tables (2016).  Results:   Overall, pathology of ePLND specimens revealed 31 pelvic metastatic lymph nodes in 12 patients. 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET visual analysis correctly detected suspicious nodes in 7 patients, yielding a sensitivity of 58% and a specificity of 98%. The area under the ROC curve for primary tumour SUVmax was 0.70, for PSMAtotal 0.76 and for PSMAvol 0.75. The optimal cut-off for nodal involvement was PSMAtotal > 49.1. The PET model including PSA, Gleason score and quantitative PET parameters had a persistently higher net benefit compared with all clinical nomograms.  Conclusion:   Our model combining PSA, Gleason score and visual lymph node analysis on 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET with PSMAtotal of the primary tumour showed a tendency to improve patient selection for ePLND over the currently used clinical nomograms. Although this result has to be validated, 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET showed the potential to reduce unnecessary surgical procedures in patients with intermediate- or high-risk prostate cancer.""","""['Daniela A Ferraro', 'Urs J Muehlematter', 'Helena I Garcia Schüler', 'Niels J Rupp', 'Martin Huellner', 'Michael Messerli', 'Jan Hendrik Rüschoff', 'Edwin E G W Ter Voert', 'Thomas Hermanns', 'Irene A Burger']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Eur J Nucl Med Mol Imaging""","""['Histological comparison between predictive value of preoperative 3-T multiparametric MRI and 68 Ga-PSMA PET/CT scan for pathological outcomes at radical prostatectomy and pelvic lymph node dissection for prostate cancer.', 'One-Stop-Shop Whole-Body 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/MRI Compared with Clinical Nomograms for Preoperative T and N Staging of High-Risk Prostate Cancer.', 'Development and Internal Validation of a Novel Model to Identify the Candidates for Extended Pelvic Lymph Node Dissection in Prostate Cancer.', 'PSMA PET Scan Era: A Changing Paradigm PSMA PET and Lymph Node Dissection for Prostate Cancer Management.', 'Can Negative Prostate-specific Membrane Antigen Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography Avoid the Need for Pelvic Lymph Node Dissection in Newly Diagnosed Prostate Cancer Patients?

Results:   516 prostate biopsy sessions in 475 different men were analysed.

Aim:   To develop preoperative and postoperative nomograms to aid in the prediction of erectile function recovery after RP.  Main outcome measures:   International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) erectile function domain score-based erectile function.  Methods:   A prospective quality-of-life database was used to develop a series of nomograms using multivariable ordinal logistic regression models. Standard preoperative and postoperative factors were included.  Main outcome measures:   The nomograms predicted the probability of recovering functional erections (erectile function domain scores ≥24) and severe erectile dysfunction (≤10) 2 years after RP.  Results:   3 nomograms have been developed, including a preoperative, an early postoperative, and a 12-month postoperative version. The concordance indexes for all 3 exceeded 0.78, and the calibration was good.  Clinical implications:   These nomograms may aid clinicians in discussing erectile function recovery with patients undergoing RP.  Strengths & limitations:   Strengths of this study included a large population, validated instrument, nerve-sparing grading, and nomograms that are well calibrated with excellent discrimination ability. Limitations include current absence of external validation and an overall low comorbidity index.

Methods:   A total of 46 men between 51 and 92 years of age with CaP and receiving ADT were classified as frail, prefrail or robust according to the Fried scale. A geriatric assessment was performed, based on the Minimental State Examination for cognitive function, the Barthel index for basic activities of daily living, the Yesavage scale for geriatric depression, and the Athens insomnia scale. In addition, blood samples were collected to assess peripheral inflammation biomarkers including proinflammatory cytokines, fibrinogen, CRP and leukocyte differential count, as well as other biochemical and hematological parameters.  Results:   A significant negative correlation between the severity of frailty syndrome and lymphocyte count was observed (P < 0.01). The concentration of IL-6 (P < 0.05), CRP (P < 0.05), and fibrinogen (P < 0.01) were significantly associated with frailty syndrome, but not of TNF-α, IL-beta, or IL-8. The severity of frailty syndrome was not dependent upon the clinical disease stage at diagnosis, the time elapsed since CaP diagnosis, the presence of metastases, or prostatectomy.

AR guides cytodifferentiation and homeostasis in benign luminal epithelial cells; however, in PC, AR instead drives the uncontrolled proliferation of these cells. This 'AR malignancy shift' (AMS) is a central event in tumorigenesis. Using a ChIP-seq approach in primary human tissues, cell lines, and mouse models, we demonstrate that the AMS occurs in every sample analyzed, suggesting that it is necessary for PC development. Using molecular and genetic techniques, we demonstrate that forkhead box (FOX)A1, HOXB13, GATA2, and c-JUN are involved in the regulation of the AMS. AR-binding sites (ARBS) are enriched for FOX, HOX, and GATA motifs in PC cells but not for c-JUN motifs in benign cells. We show that the SPOP mutation commonly found in localized PCs can cause the AMS but is not transformative on its own and must be coupled to another mutation to transform cells. We show that the AMS occurs in mouse models of PC as well and that chronic low T, which is associated with increased PC risk and aggressiveness in humans, also causes the AMS in mice. We have discovered a previously unrecognized, fundamental tenet of PC, one which explains how and why AR signaling is different in cancer and benign cells. Our work has the potential to be used to stratify patients with localized PC for specific treatments.

Methods:   Patients with localised prostate cancer treated with 81 Gy in 45 fx of IMRT over 9 weeks were retrospectively compared: 65 patients with SpaceOAR and 56 patients without SpaceOAR. Planning aims restricted rectal doses to V40 Gy < 35%, V65 Gy < 17%, V75 Gy < 10%. Toxicities were evaluated between 3 months and 3 years after the completion of radiotherapy and were based on the common terminology criteria for adverse events (CTCAE) assessment tool for diarrhoea, haemorrhoids, faecal incontinence and proctitis.  Results:   The cumulative incidence of low-grade diarrhoea (G1) was significantly higher in the non-SpaceOAR group (21.4% vs 6.2%; P = 0.016). The cumulative incidence of proctitis (grades G1 and G2) was also higher in the non-SpaceOAR group (26.7% vs 9.2%; P = 0.015); the cumulative incidence of G2 proctitis was higher in the latter group (P = 0.043). There were no differences between the treatment groups for cumulative incidences of faecal incontinence and/or haemorrhoids. Three years after IMRT, diarrhoea and proctitis were higher in the non-SpaceOAR group, without reaching statistical significance. This finding was unchanged after correcting for baseline symptoms.

There is no superiority regarding diagnostic efficacy of prostate cancer (PCa) detection.  Objective:   To compare adverse events (AEs) among three TB techniques and to evaluate the effect on urinary and erectile function.  Design, setting, and participants:   Post hoc analysis of a multicentre randomised controlled trial among men with negative systematic biopsy (SB) and suspicion of PCa.  Intervention:   In 234 patients, 3-T multiparametric MRI demonstrated PIRADS≥ 3 lesions, and patients were randomised 1:1:1 for TB: transrectal in-bore MRI TB (MRI-TB), transperineal MRI-transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) fusion TB (FUS-TB), and transrectal cognitive TRUS TB (COG-TB).  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   AEs (Clavien-Dindo) were compared using Pearson chi-square test. Univariate logistic regression tests were performed for the number of cores, biopsy approach, and usage of anticoagulants. The participants filled in baseline and 30-d postbiopsy International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) and International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF-5) questionnaires. The delta between measurements was compared using one-way analysis of variance.  Results and limitations:   There were significant differences in minor AEs: 53% in MRI-TB, 71% in FUS-TB, and 85% in COG-TB (p < 0.001). The number of cores was associated with AEs (odds ratio [OR] 1.11 per extra biopsy [95% confidence interval {CI} 1.06-1.17, p < 0.001]). Anticoagulants were not associated with bleeding complications (OR 1.24 [95% CI 0.66-2.35, p = 0.5]). Transrectal approach (MRI-TB + COG-TB) increased the risk of any AE (OR 2.54 [95% CI 1.16-5.77, p < 0.05]) and nonsignificantly increased the risk of urinary tract infections (OR 3.69 [95% CI 0.46-168.4, p = 0.3]). Biopsy did not impact urinary (ΔIPSS 0.3, p = 0.1) and erectile function (ΔIIEF-5 -0.4, p = 0.5). The main limitation was that additional SB was performed in FUS-TB and COG-TB, and was omitted in MRI-TB, making comparison difficult.  Conclusions:   There was a significant difference in minor AEs among groups. An increase in the number of cores increased the overall risk of AEs.

Sometimes renal dilution of urine can be problematic in this type of urinary biomarker analysis. Currently, various normalization techniques such as creatinine ratio, osmolality, specific gravity, dry mass, urine volume, and area under the curve are used to account for the renal dilution. However, these normalization techniques have their own drawbacks. In this project, mass spectrometry-based urinary metabolomic data obtained from prostate cancer (n = 56), bladder cancer (n = 57) and control (n = 69) groups were analyzed using statistical normalization techniques. The normalization techniques investigated in this study are Creatinine Ratio, Log Value, Linear Baseline, Cyclic Loess, Quantile, Probabilistic Quotient, Auto Scaling, Pareto Scaling, and Variance Stabilizing Normalization. The appropriate summary statistics for comparison of normalization techniques were created using variances, coefficients of variation, and boxplots. For each normalization technique, a principal component analysis was performed to identify clusters based on cancer type. In addition, hypothesis tests were conducted to determine if the normalized biomarkers could be used to differentiate between the cancer types. The results indicate that the determination of statistical significance can be dependent upon which normalization method is utilized. Therefore, careful consideration should go into choosing an appropriate normalization technique as no method had universally superior performance.""","""['Tyler Cook', 'Yinfa Ma', 'Sanjeewa Gamagedara']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""J Pharm Biomed Anal""","""['Osmolality-based normalization enhances statistical discrimination of untargeted metabolomic urine analysis: results from a comparative study.', 'Urine metabolomics analysis based on ultra performance liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry combined with osmolality calibration sample concentration variability.', 'Metabolomic analysis of urine samples by UHPLC-QTOF-MS: Impact of normalization strategies.', 'Mass spectrometric based approaches in urine metabolomics and biomarker discovery.', 'Current Trends in Cancer Biomarker Discovery Using Urinary Metabolomics: Achievements and New Challenges.', 'MetaboDirect: an analytical pipeline for the processing of FT-ICR MS-based metabolomic data.', 'Health associations of liver enzymes and inflammatory scores with urinary citrus flavonoid metabolites.', 'Characteristics of Normalization Methods in Quantitative Urinary Metabolomics-Implications for Epidemiological Applications and Interpretations.', 'A Comprehensive Evaluation of Metabolomics Data Preprocessing Methods for Deep Learning.', 'Current State of Metabolomics Research in Meat Quality Analysis and Authentication.']"""

We evaluated intermediate term decision regret after open and robot-assisted radical prostatectomy.  Materials and methods:   The HAROW (Hormonal Therapy, Active Surveillance, Radiation, Operation, Watchful Waiting) study analyzed localized prostate cancer treatments (T2c N0 M0 or less) in Germany from 2008 to 2013. We collected intermediate term followup data on 1,260 patients after retropubic open or robot-assisted radical prostatectomy.  Results:   The response rate was 76.8% (936 of 1,218 cases). A total of 404 patients underwent robot-assisted radical prostatectomy and 532 underwent open radical prostatectomy. Patients treated with the robot-assisted procedure showed more self-determined behavior. They reported an active role in surgical decision making and the surgical approach (robot-assisted radical vs open prostatectomy 39% vs 24% and 52% vs 18%, respectively, each p <0.001). Patients treated with the robot-assisted procedure more often participated actively in selecting the treating hospital (25% vs 11%), used the Internet often (87% vs 72%) and traveled an increased distance (63 vs 42 km, all p <0.001). Overall decision regret was low with a mean ± SD score of 14 ± 19 on a scale of 0-no regret to 100-high regret. Multivariate analysis showed that erectile function (OR 3.2), urinary continence (OR 1.8), freedom from recurrence (OR 1.6), an active decision making role (OR 2.2) and shorter followup (OR 0.9 per year) predicted low decision regret (score less than 15).  Conclusions:   Intermediate term functional and oncologic outcomes as well as autonomous decision making and followup time influenced decision regret after radical prostatectomy.

Methods:   A total of 260 patients with prostate SCC were selected from the SEER database of the National Cancer Institute between 2004 and 2015. Age-adjusted incidence (AAI) rates, the observed and relative survival rates were evaluated over time by the SEER*Stat Software version 8.3.5. Overall survival (OS) rates that stratified by summary stage and treatment effects were evaluated by Kaplan-Meier method. The significant differences were assessed in a log-rank test. Univariate and multivariate cox hazard regression analysis were performed to determine independent predictors of OS.  Results:   The incidence of prostate SCC has increased over time. The average age of prostate SCC patients was 70.25 years. More than 90% of tumors were poorly differentiated or undifferentiated. The majority of prostate SCC (77.7%) was at stage IV. 49% of patients had lymph node metastases and 68% of patients presented distant metastases (Compared with 60.5% of patients with distant metastases between 1973-2003). Interestingly only 23.5% patients had high level PSA (>10 ng/mL). 58.8% of patients underwent chemotherapy, 25.4% of patients were treated by surgery, and 31.9% of patients were treated by radiotherapy. The observed survival rates of 1-year, 2-year, and 5-year were 42.1%, 22.1%, and 12.5%, respectively (Compared with 47.9%, 27.5%, and 14.3%, respectively, between 1973 and 2003). Chemotherapy prolonged the OS of patients with regional (distant) metastases from 3 months (2 months) to 12 months (9 months). Multivariate cox regression analysis showed age, race, and stage were independent prognostic factors for prostate SCC patients.  Conclusion:   Prostate SCC is a highly malignant cancer and our analysis of recent data has shown its incidence is increasing. Incidence rate of metastatic prostate SCC has increased and the survival rates have worsened in recent years. However, chemotherapy shows some survival benefit for prostate SCC patients with regional and distant metastasis over other treatment methods.

Methods:   Forty-eight patients undergoing radical retropubic prostatectomy with sevoflurane/sufentanil anesthesia were randomly assigned into 4 groups and received sufentanil guided either by 1 of 3 analgesia monitoring devices (Surgical Pleth Index [SPI], Pupillary Pain Index [PPI], Nociception Level [NoL]) or by clinical judgment (control). The primary end point was intraoperative sufentanil consumption. Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and cortisol were measured at 4 time points during the day of surgery. Data were analyzed by Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney U tests and by mixed model and area under the curve (AUC) analyses for group comparisons and time effects of stress hormones.  Results:   The total amount of sufentanil administration (μg·kg·minute·10) differed between the groups (median [quartiles]: control = 5.6 [4.4-6.4], SPI = 7.2 [4.8-8.4], PPI = 2.0 [1.8-2.9], NoL = 3.8 [3.3-5.1]; PPI versus SPI, -5.1 [-6.6 to -1.3], P < .001; NoL versus SPI, -3.0 [-5.2 to 0.2], P = .024; control versus SPI, -1.6 [-3.7 to 1.7], P = .128; NoL versus PPI, 1.7 [0.6-3.4], P < .001; control versus PPI, 3.4 [2.0-4.6], P < .001; control versus NoL, 1.6 [-0.2 to 3.3], P = .017) (Hodges-Lehmann estimator [99% confidence interval {CI}], P values). The AUC analysis indicated differences among groups in cumulative ACTH levels (ng·liter·minute, natural logarithm (ln)-transformed data) of NoL versus PPI (-1.079 [-1.950 to -0.208], P = .001) and PPI versus SPI (1.192 [0.317-2.068], P= .001), as well as differences in cortisol levels (µg·liter·minute) for PPI versus SPI (46,710 [21,145-72,274], P < .001), NoL versus SPI (27,645 [3163-52,126], P = .003), and control versus SPI (31,824 [6974-56,675], P = .001) (differences in means [99% CI], P value). Secondary end points (postoperative recovery, pain level, and analgesia medication) showed no differences.  Conclusions:   The type of analgesia nociception monitoring affected the total amount of sufentanil administered.

PAK-1 expression is altered in various cancers, including prostate and breast. Our recent studies showed that prostate cancer cells expressing higher levels of PAK-1 were resistant to the cytotoxic effects of the PAK-1 inhibitor, inhibitor targeting PAK-1 activation-3 (IPA-3), compared to those with lower expression. This study expanded these findings to other cancers (breast and melanoma) by testing the hypothesis that genetic and pharmacological inhibition of PAK-1 alters cell growth, migration, and invasion in prostate, breast, and skin cancer cell lines. We also tested the specificity of IPA-3 for PAK-1 and the hypothesis that gene silencing of PAK-1 altered the efficacy of sterically stabilized liposomes (SSL) containing IPA-3 (SSL-IPA-3). PAK-1 expression was identified in four different breast cancer cell lines, and in a melanoma cell line. The expression of PAK-1 correlated to the IC50 of IPA-3 as measured by MTT staining. PAK-1 inhibition using shRNA correlated with decreased cell migration and invasion in prostate cancer DU-145 and breast cancer MCF-7 cells. Decreased migration and invasion also correlated to decreased expression of E-cadherin and alterations in C-X-C Chemokine Receptor type 4 and Homing Cell Adhesion Molecule expression. PAK-1 inhibition increased the cytotoxicity of IPA-3, and the cytotoxicity of SSL-IPA-3 to levels comparable to that of free drug. These data demonstrate that both pharmacological and molecular inhibition of PAK-1 decreased growth in prostate, breast, and melanoma cancer cell lines, and increased the toxicity of IPA-3 and its liposomal formulation. These data also show the specificity of IPA-3 for PAK-1, are some of the first data suggesting that IPA-3 is a therapeutic treatment for breast cancer and melanoma, and demonstrate the efficacy of liposome-encapsulated IPA-3 in breast cancer cells.""","""['Wided Najahi-Missaoui', 'Nhat D Quach', 'Amber Jenkins', 'Isha Dabke', 'Payaningal R Somanath', 'Brian S Cummings']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Pharmacol Res Perspect""","""['Liposomes Targeting P21 Activated Kinase-1 (PAK-1) and Selective for Secretory Phospholipase A2 (sPLA2) Decrease Cell Viability and Induce Apoptosis in Metastatic Triple-Negative Breast Cancer Cells.', 'Liposome-mediated delivery of the p21 activated kinase-1 (PAK-1) inhibitor IPA-3 limits prostate tumor growth in vivo.', 'Targeting p21-activated kinase 1 inhibits growth and metastasis via Raf1/MEK1/ERK signaling in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma cells.', 'p21-activated kinase inhibitors.', 'Current trends and opportunities in targeting p21 activated kinase-1(PAK1) for therapeutic management of breast cancers.', 'Targeting P21-Activated Kinase-1 for Metastatic Prostate Cancer.', 'Blocking PI3K p110β Attenuates Development of PTEN-Deficient Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'The Use of Nanomedicine to Target Signaling by the PAK Kinases for Disease Treatment.', 'Proteogenomic characterization of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.', 'Liposomes Targeting P21 Activated Kinase-1 (PAK-1) and Selective for Secretory Phospholipase A2 (sPLA2) Decrease Cell Viability and Induce Apoptosis in Metastatic Triple-Negative Breast Cancer Cells.']"""

Subsequently, these antibodies were used to evaluate ANKRD22 levels via immunohistochemical staining in prostate cancer tissues. Finally, the association between ANKRD22 levels and prostate cancer progression was analyzed in 636 samples of prostate cancer using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. A total of four anti-ANKRD22 monoclonal antibodies were generated and validated, which could be effectively blocked by recombinant ANKRD22 protein. Using these antibodies for immunohistochemical staining, ANKRD22 was detected in prostate cancer cells in both the cytoplasm and nucleus. Bioinformatics analysis demonstrated that the mRNA level of ANKRD22 was inversely associated with prostate cancer stage (P<0.05) and Gleason score (P<0.01) in TCGA database. Patients with higher ANKRD22 mRNA levels exhibited longer disease-free survival following radical prostatectomy.

By administering abiraterone acetate with food, a reduced dose can potentially be given while maintaining equivalent abiraterone exposure. Moreover, administering abiraterone acetate with a breakfast is considered more patient friendly. The aim of this study was to establish the bio-equivalent lower dose of abiraterone when taken with a continental breakfast (CB) compared to the standard intake of 1000 mg OD fasted.  Methods:   In this phase I, randomized cross-over, multi-center study, abiraterone pharmacokinetics (PK) were evaluated in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer who were treated for 14 days with 1000 mg abiraterone acetate taken fasted, followed by 14 days of treatment with 500 mg taken with a CB.  Results:   14 patients were enrolled into the study, of whom 12 were eligible for PK analysis. The geometric mean ratio (GMR) (fed/fasted) was 0.88 (90% CI 0.73-1.07) for area-under-the-curve (AUC0-24h), 1.03 (90% CI 0.79-1.34) for Cmax and 0.81 (90% CI 0.60-1.10) for Ctrough, respectively. High inter-patient variability (> 50%) was found for all PK parameters under both intake conditions. Patients seemed to be slightly more satisfied about the intake of 500 mg abiraterone acetate when taken with a CB compared to 1000 mg fasted.  Conclusion:   In conclusion, a bioequivalent lower dose of abiraterone taken with food could not be established in our study. Although based on the absence of a exposure-toxicity relationship, the strict bioequivalence margins as defined by the FDA guidelines could be applied more flexible for abiraterone.

Distinct biological subsets of the disease might derive the greatest benefit from the addition of platinum. We aimed to determine whether adding carboplatin to cabazitaxel would improve the outcomes of men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.  Methods:   We did a phase 1-2, open label, randomised study at two centres in men with progressive metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. In phase 1, patients received intravenous cabazitaxel 20-25 mg/m2 and intravenous carboplatin area under the curve (AUC) 3-4 mg/mL per min every 21 days. The maximum tolerated dose was defined as the highest dose cohort studied in which one of six or fewer patients experienced a dose-limiting toxicity. In phase 2, patients were randomly assigned (1:1) centrally by a computerised algorithm to intravenous cabazitaxel 25 mg/m2 with or without intravenous carboplatin AUC 4 mg/mL per min. All patients received growth factor support and oral prednisone 10 mg daily. The primary endpoints were the maximum tolerated dose of the combination in phase 1 and investigator-assessed progression-free survival in phase 2. This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01505868.  Findings:   Between Aug 17, 2012, and May 11, 2015, nine patients completed phase 1 as planned, and 160 were randomly assigned to cabazitaxel (n=79) or cabazitaxel plus carboplatin (n=81) in phase 2. During phase I, grade 3 adverse events were anaemia (n=2), fatigue (n=1), thrombocytopenia (n=1), hypomagnesaemia (n=1), diarrhoea (n=1), hypokalaemia (n=1), anorexia (n=1), and dehydration (n=1), and no grade 4 adverse events occurred. No dose-limiting toxicities were observed, therefore, a maximum tolerated dose of cabazitaxel of 25 mg/m2 and carboplatin of AUC 4 mg/mL per min was selected for phase 2. At a median follow-up of 31·0 months (IQR 20·5-37·1), the combination improved the median progression-free survival from 4·5 months (95% CI 3·5-5·7) to 7·3 months (95% CI 5·5-8·2; hazard ratio 0·69, 95% CI 0·50-0·95, p=0·018). In the phase 2 study, the most common grade 3-5 adverse events were fatigue (7 [9%] of 79 in the cabazitaxel group vs 16 [20%] of 81 in the combination group), anaemia (3 [4%] vs 19 [23%]), neutropenia (3 [4%] vs 13 [16%]), and thrombocytopenia (1 [1%] vs 11 [14%]). There were no treatment-related deaths.  Interpretation:   Carboplatin added to cabazitaxel showed improved clinical efficacy compared with cabazitaxel alone for men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. Although adverse events were more common with the combination, the treatment was safe and generally well tolerated. Our data suggest that taxane-platinum combinations have a clinically beneficial role in advanced prostate cancer and a randomised phase 3 study is planned.

We propose a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) to detect intestinal/rectal gas in the pelvic region.  Material and methods:   We selected 300 anterior-posterior kilo-voltage (kV) X-ray images from 30 prostate cancer patients. Thirty images were randomly chosen for a test set, and the remaining 270 images used as the training set. The intestinal/rectal gas was manually delineated on kV X-ray images and segmented. The training images were augmented by applying artificial shifts and fed into a DCNN. The network models were trained to keep the quality of the output image close to the quality of the input image by pooling and upsampling. The training set was used to adjust the parameters of the DCNN, and the test set was used to assess the performance of the model. The performance of the DCNN was evaluated using a fivefold cross-validation procedure. The dice similarity coefficient (DSC) was calculated to evaluate the detection accuracy between the manual contour and auto-segmentation.  Results:   The DCNN was trained within approximately 17 min with a time step of 20 s/epoch. The training and validation accuracy of the models after 50epochs were 0.94 and 0.85, respectively. The average ± standard deviation of the DSC for 30 test images was 0.85 ± 0.08.

The ratio of the gap areas at 0 h and 24 h were used to calculate the relative migration.

Moreover, sCD27 level is associated with the prognosis of patients with prostate cancer who receive immunotherapy.  Objective:   In this study, we assessed sCD27 levels in patients with advanced lung cancer and determined their correlation with survival and clinicopathologic parameters.  Methods:   Serum samples were collected from patients with advanced lung cancer, and sCD27 was quantified via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The association between sCD27 levels and clinicopathologic status and patient survival was retrospectively analyzed.  Results:   Of 96 patients analyzed, 73 had adenocarcinoma, 7 had squamous cell carcinoma, and 15 had small cell carcinoma. Median serum sCD27 level was 36.54 U/mL (range, undetectable-104.47); this is lower than that previously reported for patients with lung cancer, including those with localized stages.

Family history is often determined in the research setting through kindreds with disease clusters, or clinically from self-report. The population prevalence of individuals with diagnostic characteristics and/or family cancer history meeting criteria for HBOC testing is unknown.  Methods:   Utilizing Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) cancer registry data and a research resource linking registry records to genealogies, the Utah Population Database, the population-based prevalence of diagnostic and family history characteristics meeting National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) criteria for HBOC testing was objectively assessed.  Results:   Among Utah residents with an incident breast cancer diagnosis 2010-2015 and evaluable for family history, 21.6% met criteria for testing based on diagnostic characteristics, but the proportion increased to 62.9% when family history was evaluated. The proportion of cases meeting testing criteria at diagnosis was 94% for ovarian cancer, 23% for prostate cancer, and 51.1% for pancreatic cancer. Among an unaffected Utah population of approximately 1.7 million evaluable for family history, 197,601 or 11.6% met testing criteria based on family history.  Conclusions:   This study quantifies the population-based prevalence of HBOC criteria using objectively determined genealogy and cancer incidence data. Sporadic breast cancer likely represents a portion of the high prevalence of family cancer history seen in this study. These results underline the importance of establishing presence of a deleterious mutation in an affected family member, per NCCN guidelines, before testing unaffected relatives.""","""['Samantha Greenberg', 'Saundra S Buys', 'Sandra L Edwards', 'Whitney Espinel', 'Alison Fraser', 'Amanda Gammon', 'Brent Hafen', 'Kimberly A Herget', 'Wendy Kohlmann', 'Camille Roundy', 'Carol Sweeney']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Cancer Med""","""['Germline mutation prevalence in individuals with pancreatic cancer and a history of previous malignancy.', 'BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutational profile and prevalence in hereditary breast and ovarian cancer (HBOC) probands from Southern Brazil: Are international testing criteria appropriate for this specific population?', 'Risk of Prostate Cancer Associated With Familial and Hereditary Cancer Syndromes.', 'Genetic Tests for Breast and Ovarian Cancer Internet.', 'Current clinical issues and recent trends in hereditary breast and ovarian cancer in Japan-genetic testing for HBOC and risk-reducing surgery.', 'Prevalence of Americans reporting a family history of cancer indicative of increased cancer risk: Estimates from the 2015 National Health Interview Survey.', 'Retrospective assessment of barriers and access to genetic services for hereditary cancer syndromes in an integrated health care delivery system.', 'Using a Tailored Digital Health Intervention for Family Communication and Cascade Genetic Testing in Swiss and Korean Families With Hereditary Breast and Ovarian Cancer: Protocol for the DIALOGUE Study.', 'Identification of women at risk for hereditary breast and ovarian cancer in a sample of 1000 Slovenian women: a comparison of guidelines.', 'Interventions Facilitating Family Communication of Genetic Testing Results and Cascade Screening in Hereditary Breast/Ovarian Cancer or Lynch Syndrome: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.']"""

Knock-down of GRIM-19 increased the resistance of PC cells to docetaxel, and overexpression of GRIM-19 promoted docetaxel-induced apoptotic death in PC cells. Mechanistically, GRIM-19 downregulated the expression of the survival gene Rad23b, which promoted DNA damage repair. Overexpression of Rad23b reversed GRIM-19-mediated response to docetaxel in PC cells.

Prior studies have raised concerns of racial/ethnic disparities in the detection rates of P/LP variants and variants of uncertain significance (VUSs). In 2018, Color Genomics™, a commercial laboratory, made de-identified, aggregate genetic and clinical information from 50,000 individuals who completed testing for 30 cancer predisposition genes publicly available. It is the largest publicly available database of its kind from a single laboratory. An analysis of individuals from this database with a negative personal history of cancer that identify as European (n = 31,920), Hispanic (n = 1700), African (n = 462) or Asian and Pacific Islander (n = 2602), demonstrated that the VUS rate in the hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome and Lynch syndrome genes was higher for all non-European groups as compared to the European group; Hispanic (7.1% vs. 5.8%; p = 0.029), African (12.3% vs. 5.8%; p < 0.001), Asian and Pacific Islander (13.1% vs. 5.8%; p < 0.001).

As a result in the USA there was a stage shift towards more advanced tumor stages under the newly detected prostate cancers; however, in contrast to the highly questionable American PLCO study, the European ERSPC study showed a clear reduction in prostate cancer-related mortality.  Objective:   In this patient cohort it was investigated whether the tumor stage distribution in curatively treated prostate cancer has significantly changed, whether this has an influence on the perioperative results and complication rates and how these changes could have occurred.  Material and methods:   Patients after radical prostatectomy from 2008 to 2010 were compared to those from 2017. Demographic data, intraoperative courses, perioperative and postoperative complications and histopathological results were compared.  Results:   A total of 1276 operations were analyzed. Preoperative PSA levels showed a significant increase in 2017 (10.5 ± 13.4 ng/ml vs. 8.4 ± 9.1 ng/ml, p = 0.032). The pathological staging revealed a 20% increase in T3 tumors (49.4% versus 29.0%, p < 0.001). Correspondingly, moderately and poorly differentiated cancers and therefore those with higher aggressiveness were significantly more frequent with 11.2% (p < 0.001) and 10.4% (p < 0.001), respectively. The number of patients with lymph node metastases at prostatectomy even increased fourfold (4.5% vs. 16.9%, p < 0.001).

Methods:   ""HAROW"" was a large German noninterventional health services research study that prospectively evaluated the treatment of patients with localized prostate cancer (≤ T2c).

Results:   After a median follow-up of 6.3 [interquartile range (IQR) 4.8-7.6] years, 42 (3%) patients had died. The return rate of the questionnaire was 76.8% (936/1218).

This work develops an inverse optimization method for generating efficiently deliverable PBS plans. The proposed minimum-MU and sparse-energy-layer (MMSEL) constrained inverse optimization method utilizes iterative convex relaxations to handle the nonconvexity from minimum-MU constraint and dose-volume constraints, and regularizes group sparsity of proton spots to minimize the number of energy layers. The tradeoff between plan quality and delivery efficiency (in terms of the number of used energy layers) is controlled by the objective weighting of group sparsity regularization. MMSEL consists of two steps: first minimize for appropriate energy layers, and then with selected energy layers solve for the deliverable PBS plan. The solution algorithm for MMSEL is developed using alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). Range and setup uncertainties are modelled by robust optimization. MMSEL was validated using representative prostate, lung, and head-and-neck (HN) cases. The minimum-MU constraint was strictly enforced for all cases, so that all plans were deliverable. The number of energy layers was reduced by MMSEL to 78%, 76%, and 61% for prostate, lung and HN, respectively, while the similar plan quality was achieved. The number of energy layers was reduced by MMSEL to 54%, 57%, and 37% for prostate, lung and HN, respectively, while the plan quality was comprised and acceptable. MMSEL is proposed to strictly enforce minimum-MU constraint and minimize the number of energy layers during inverse optimization for efficiently deliverable PBS plans. In particular, the preliminary results suggest MMSEL potentially enables 25% to 40% reduction of energy layers while maintaining the similar plan quality.""","""['Yuting Lin', 'Benjamin Clasie', 'Tian Liu', 'Mark McDonald', 'Katja M Langen', 'Hao Gao']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Phys Med Biol""","""['Technical Note: Plan-delivery-time constrained inverse optimization method with minimum-MU-per-energy-layer (MMPEL) for efficient pencil beam scanning proton therapy.', 'Minimum MU optimization (MMO): an inverse optimization approach for the PBS minimum MU constraint.', 'Robust optimization in IMPT using quadratic objective functions to account for the minimum MU constraint.', 'Energy layer optimization strategies for intensity-modulated proton therapy of lung cancer patients.', 'Treatment planning for proton therapy: what is needed in the next 10 years?', 'Beam angle optimization for proton therapy via group-sparsity based angle generation method.', 'A treatment plan optimization method with direct minimization of number of energy jumps for proton arc therapy.', 'Fraction optimization for hybrid proton-photon treatment planning.', 'An iterative convex relaxation method for proton LET optimization.', 'TVL1-IMPT: Optimization of Peak-to-Valley Dose Ratio Via Joint Total-Variation and L1 Dose Regularization for Spatially Fractionated Pencil-Beam-Scanning Proton Therapy.']"""

Cancer growth and progression is intimately affected by its interaction with host microenvironment. Cotargeting of the stroma and prostate cancer is therefore an emerging therapeutic strategy for metastatic CRPC. Cancer-induced osteoclastogenesis is known to contribute to CRPC bone metastasis. This study is to extend pharmacologic value of our synthesized LCC03, a derivative of 5-(2',4'-difluorophenyl)-salicylanilide that has previously testified for its osteoclastogenesis activity, by exploring its additional cytotoxic properties and underlying mechanism in CRPC cells. LCC03 was chemically synthesized and examined for cell growth inhibition in a serial of CRPC cell lines. We demonstrated that LCC03 dose-dependently suppressed proliferation and retarded cell-cycle progression in CRPC cells. The classical autophagy features, including autophagosome formation and LC3-II conversion, were dramatically shown in LCC03-treated CRPC cells, and it was associated with the suppressed AKT/mTOR signaling pathways, a major negative regulator of autophagy. Moreover, an expanded morphology of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), increased expression of the ER stress markers GRP78 and PERK, and eIF2α phosphorylation were observed.

We aimed to examine incidentally diagnosed cancer among a cohort of cancer patients diagnosed in England.  Design:   Cross-sectional study of national primary care audit data on an incident cancer patient population.  Setting:   We analysed free-text information on the presenting features of cancer patients aged 15 or older included in the English National Audit of Cancer Diagnosis in Primary Care (2009-2010). Patients with screen-detected cancers or prostate cancer were excluded. We examined the odds of incidental cancer diagnosis by patient characteristics and cancer site using logistic regression, and described clinical scenarios leading to incidental diagnosis.  Results:   Among the studied cancer patient population (n=13 810), 520 (4%) patients were diagnosed incidentally. The odds of incidental cancer diagnosis increased with age (p<0.001), with no difference between men and women after adjustment. Incidental diagnosis was most common among patients with leukaemia (23%), renal (13%) and thyroid cancer (12%), and least common among patients with brain (0.9%), oesophageal (0.5%) and cervical cancer (no cases diagnosed incidentally). Variation in odds of incidental diagnosis by cancer site remained after adjusting for age group and sex.There was a range of clinical scenarios preceding incidental diagnoses in primary or secondary care. These included the monitoring or management of pre-existing conditions, routine testing before or after elective surgery, and the investigation of unrelated acute or new conditions.  Conclusions:   One in 25 patients with cancer in our population-based cohort were diagnosed incidentally, through different mechanisms across primary and secondary care settings.

The presence of PEG10 in other subtypes of prostate cancer has not been explored and a utility for PEG10 overexpression has not been developed. Here, we found that in addition to AR-null disease, PEG10 was also expressed in prostate cancer with constitutively active AR-splice variants. A molecular genetic imaging strategy for noninvasive imaging of AR-splice variant prostate cancer was developed by utilizing the cancer specificity of the PEG10 promoter to drive the expression of reporter genes. Plasmid insertion of a PEG10 promoter sequence optimized for enhanced output upstream of a reporter gene allowed detection of prostate cancer by near-infrared and positron emission tomography imaging after systemic administration of the plasmid in vivo. PEG10 expressing subcutaneous xenograft and intratibial tumor models were imaged by both modalities using this molecular genetic imaging strategy. This study demonstrates a preclinical proof-of-concept that the PEG10 promoter is a powerful and specific tool that can be utilized for noninvasive detection of aggressive prostate cancer subtypes.

ABI1, a member of WAVE complex and actin cytoskeleton regulator and adaptor protein, acts as tumor suppressor in prostate cancer but the role of ABI1 in EMT is not clear.  Methods:   To investigate the molecular mechanism by which loss of ABI1 contributes to tumor progression, we disrupted the ABI1 gene in the benign prostate epithelial RWPE-1 cell line and determined its phenotype. Levels of ABI1 expression in prostate organoid tumor cell lines was evaluated by Western blotting and RNA sequencing. ABI1 expression and its association with prostate tumor grade was evaluated in a TMA cohort of 505 patients and metastatic cell lines.  Results:   Low ABI1 expression is associated with biochemical recurrence, metastasis and death (p = 0.038). Moreover, ABI1 expression was significantly decreased in Gleason pattern 5 vs. pattern 4 (p = 0.0025) and 3 (p = 0.0012), indicating an association between low ABI1 expression and highly invasive prostate tumors. Disruption of ABI1 gene in RWPE-1 cell line resulted in gain of an invasive phenotype, which was characterized by a loss of cell-cell adhesion markers and increased migratory ability of RWPE-1 spheroids. Through RNA sequencing and protein expression analysis, we discovered that ABI1 loss leads to activation of non-canonical WNT signaling and EMT pathways, which are rescued by re-expression of ABI1. Furthermore, an increase in STAT3 phosphorylation upon ABI1 inactivation and the evidence of a high-affinity interaction between the FYN SH2 domain and ABI1 pY421 support a model in which ABI1 acts as a gatekeeper of non-canonical WNT-EMT pathway activation downstream of the FZD2 receptor.  Conclusions:   ABI1 controls prostate tumor progression and epithelial plasticity through regulation of EMT-WNT pathway. Here we discovered that ABI1 inhibits EMT through suppressing FYN-STAT3 activation downstream from non-canonical WNT signaling thus providing a novel mechanism of prostate tumor suppression.""","""['Disharee Nath', 'Xiang Li', 'Claudia Mondragon', 'Dawn Post', 'Ming Chen', 'Julie R White', 'Anita Hryniewicz-Jankowska', 'Tiffany Caza', 'Vladimir A Kuznetsov', 'Heidi Hehnly', 'Tamara Jamaspishvili', 'David M Berman', 'Fan Zhang', 'Sonia H Y Kung', 'Ladan Fazli', 'Martin E Gleave', 'Gennady Bratslavsky', 'Pier Paolo Pandolfi', 'Leszek Kotula']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Cell Commun Signal""","""['A novel non-canonical Wnt signature for prostate cancer aggressiveness.', 'Clinical implication of Frizzled 2 expression and its association with epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in hepatocellular carcinoma.', 'The metastasis suppressor CD82/KAI1 represses the TGF-β 1 and Wnt signalings inducing epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition linked to invasiveness of prostate cancer cells.', 'Cell-cell adhesion: linking Wnt/β-catenin signaling with partial EMT and stemness traits in tumorigenesis.', 'Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition Signaling and Prostate Cancer Stem Cells: Emerging Biomarkers and Opportunities for Precision Therapeutics.', 'Epithelial-to-Mesenchymal Transition-Related Markers in Prostate Cancer: From Bench to Bedside.', 'WAVE facilitates polarized E-cadherin transport.', 'In Vivo Models for Prostate Cancer Research.', 'GPX2 predicts recurrence-free survival and triggers the Wnt/β-catenin/EMT pathway in prostate cancer.', 'Characteristics of genomic mutations and signaling pathway alterations in thymic epithelial tumors.']"""

To understand this dichotomy, we explored the function of mitochondrial isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH)2, a tricarboxylic acid cycle enzyme mutated in subsets of acute leukemias and gliomas, in cancer. Silencing of IDH2 in prostate cancer cells impaired oxidative bioenergetics, elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and promoted exaggerated mitochondrial dynamics. This was associated with increased subcellular mitochondrial trafficking, turnover of membrane focal adhesion complexes, and enhanced tumor cell migration and invasion, without changes in cell cycle progression. Mechanistically, loss of IDH2 caused ROS-dependent stabilization of hypoxia-inducible factor-1α in normoxia, which was required for increased mitochondrial trafficking and tumor cell movements. Therefore, IDH2 is a dual regulator of cancer bioenergetics and tumor cell motility. This pathway may reprogram mitochondrial dynamics to differentially adjust energy production or promote tumor cell invasion in response to microenvironment conditions.-Wang, Y., Agarwal, E., Bertolini, I., Ghosh, J.

However, the effect of glyburide on Ca2+ movement and its related cytotoxicity in prostate cancer cells is unclear. This study examined whether glyburide altered Ca2+ signalling and viability in PC3 human prostate cancer cells and investigated those underlying mechanisms. Intracellular Ca2+ concentrations ([Ca2+ ]i ) in suspended cells were measured by using the fluorescent Ca2+ -sensitive dye fura-2. Cell viability was examined by WST-1 assay. Glyburide at concentrations of 100-1000 μM induced [Ca2+ ]i rises. Ca2+ removal reduced the signal by approximately 60%. In Ca2+ -containing medium, glyburide-induced Ca2+ entry was inhibited by 60% by protein kinase C (PKC) activator (phorbol 12-myristate 13 acetate, PMA) and inhibitor (GF109203X), and modulators of store-operated Ca2+ channels (nifedipine, econazole and SKF96365). Furthermore, glyburide induced Mn2+ influx suggesting of Ca2+ entry. In Ca2+ -free medium, inhibition of phospholipase C (PLC) with U73122 significantly inhibited glyburide-induced [Ca2+ ]i rises. Treatment with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Ca2+ pump inhibitor 2,5-di-tert-butylhydroquinone (BHQ) abolished glyburide-evoked [Ca2+ ]i rises. Conversely, treatment with glyburide abolished BHQ-evoked [Ca2+ ]i rises. Glyburide at 100-500 μM decreased cell viability, which was not reversed by pretreatment with the Ca2+ chelator 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid-acetoxymethyl ester (BAPTA/AM). Together, in PC3 cells, glyburide induced [Ca2+ ]i rises by Ca2+ entry via PKC-sensitive store-operated Ca2+ channels and Ca2+ release from the ER in a PLC-dependent manner. Glyburide also caused Ca2+ -independent cell death.

Material and methods:   This was a prospective observational study conducted on 75 patients suspected to have prostate cancer. Immunohistochemical profile was assessed for PSA, AMACR and CD10 immunostaining. The intensity of CD10 expression and pattern of CD10 staining of tumor cells was evaluated.  Results:   The patients were in age group of 50-90 years with a mean age of 70.97 ± 9.51 years. As the Grade Group/Gleason Score increased, the number of cases showing negative expression decreased and the pattern of expression changed from membranous to cytoplasmic to both types of expression. As the serum PSA levels increased the intensity of expression changed from focally positive to diffusely positive. The pattern of expression also changed from membranous to cytoplasmic to both (membranous + cytoplasmic) types of expression with an increase in PSA levels.

Nevertheless, whether inhibition of FASN could improve RT outcomes and reverse radiosensitivity of prostate cancer cells is still unknown. Here, we hypothesised that orlistat, a FASN inhibitor, could improve RT outcomes in prostate cancer. Orlistat treatment significantly reduced the S phase population in both androgen-dependent and -independent prostate cancer cells. Combination of orlistat and RT significantly decreased NF-κB activity and related downstream proteins in both prostate cancer cells. Combination effect of orlistat and RT was further investigated in both LNCaP and PC3 tumour-bearing mice.

We demonstrated potent anti-tumor effects of the BET inhibitor JQ1 against AR-positive TNBC cell lines using cell viability and cell cycle analysis. To reveal the mechanisms of JQ1 effects, multiplex gene expression analysis and immunoblotting assays were used. We examined in vivo effects of JQ1 in a xenograft model of AR expressing TNBC. JQ1 exhibited its anti-proliferative activity by inducing apoptosis and cell cycle arrest. JQ1 activity was not mediated by MYC downregulation. Instead, JQ1 blocked the interactions among the ATPase-family AAA-domain-containing 2 protein (ATAD2), BRD2, BRD4, and AR; effectively suppressing the expression of AR associated targets. In addition, JQ1 showed significant anti-tumor activity in vivo in TNBC xenograft mouse models as a monotherapy and in combination with anti-AR therapy.

Among three isoforms of T-type Ca2+ channels, Cav3.2 is detectable in 100% of biopsy samples from prostate cancer patients. In general, prostate cancer cells are highly sensitive to androgen deprivation therapy, but often acquire hormone-therapy resistance. The androgen deprivation may trigger neuroendocrine (NE)-like differentiation of some prostate cancer cells. We have analyzed the expression and function of Cav3.2 in human prostate cancer LNCaP cells during NE-like differentiation. NE-like LNCaP cells overexpress Cav3.2 through the CREB/Egr-1 pathway and also cystathionine-γ-lyase (CSE), which generates H2S that enhances the channel activity of Cav3.2. H2S generated by upregulated CSE appears to enhance the activity of upregulated Cav3.2 after the differentiation. The enhanced Cav3.2 activity in NE-like cells may contribute to increased secretion of mitogenic factors essential for androgen-independent proliferation of surrounding prostate cancer cells. It is known that increased extracellular glucose levels enhance Cav3.2 activity through asparagine (N)-linked glycosylation of Cav3.2, which might contribute to diabetic neuropathy. We then found that high glucose accelerates the enhanced channel function and overexpression of Cav3.2 in NE-like LNCaP cells, which might be associated with clinical evidence for diabetes-related poor prognosis of prostate cancer and development of hormone therapy resistance. Thus, Cav3.2 is considered to play a role in the pathophysiology of prostate cancer, and may serve as a therapeutic target.""","""['Fumiko Sekiguchi', 'Atsufumi Kawabata']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Nihon Yakurigaku Zasshi""","""['Functional upregulation of the H2S/Cav3.2 channel pathway accelerates secretory function in neuroendocrine-differentiated human prostate cancer cells.', 'Posttranscriptional regulation of T-type Ca(2+) channel expression by interleukin-6 in prostate cancer cells.', 'Endogenous and exogenous hydrogen sulfide facilitates T-type calcium channel currents in Cav3.2-expressing HEK293 cells.', 'Hydrogen Sulfide and T-Type Ca2+ Channels in Pain Processing, Neuronal Differentiation and Neuroendocrine Secretion.', 'H2S and Pain: A Novel Aspect for Processing of Somatic, Visceral and Neuropathic Pain Signals.', 'Inactivation of CACNA1H induces cell apoptosis by initiating endoplasmic reticulum stress in glioma.', 'Identification of biomarkers for immunotherapy response in prostate cancer and potential drugs to alleviate immunosuppression.', 'NF-κB-dependent secretome of senescent cells can trigger neuroendocrine transdifferentiation of breast cancer cells.']"""

In cancer cells, KCa1.1 and KCa3.1 KCa channels are co-localized with Ca2+-permeable Orai/TRP channels to provide a positive-feedback loop for Ca2+ entry. They are responsible for the promotion of cell growth and metastasis in the different types of cancer, and are therefore potential therapeutic targets and biomarkers for cancer.

We aimed to estimate the frequency CTEPH-likely patients after PE, in cancer patients.  Materials:   We individualized cancer patients of a monocentric prospective registry including consecutive patients with symptomatic PE. The primary outcome was the frequency of ""CTEPH-likely"" patients defined by the European Respiratory Society (ERS) guidelines (an accelerated tricuspid regurgitation more than 2.8m/s and at least 1-2 segmental or larger-sized defects, after more than 3 months of therapeutic anticoagulation).

For applications such as segmentation of the prostate in magnetic resonance images (MRI), the results of the PROMISE12 online algorithm evaluation platform have demonstrated differences between the best-performing segmentation algorithms in terms of numerical accuracy using standard metrics such as the Dice score and boundary distance. These small differences in the segmented regions/boundaries outputted by different algorithms may potentially have an unsubstantial impact on the results of downstream image analysis tasks, such as estimating organ volume and multimodal image registration, which inform clinical decisions. This impact has not been previously investigated. In this work, we quantified the accuracy of six different CNNs in segmenting the prostate in 3D patient T2-weighted MRI scans and compared the accuracy of organ volume estimation and MRI-ultrasound (US) registration errors using the prostate segmentations produced by different networks. Networks were trained and tested using a set of 232 patient MRIs with labels provided by experienced clinicians. A statistically significant difference was found among the Dice scores and boundary distances produced by these networks in a non-parametric analysis of variance (p < 0.001 and p < 0.001, respectively), where the following multiple comparison tests revealed that the statistically significant difference in segmentation errors were caused by at least one tested network. Gland volume errors (GVEs) and target registration errors (TREs) were then estimated using the CNN-generated segmentations. Interestingly, there was no statistical difference found in either GVEs or TREs among different networks, (p = 0.34 and p = 0.26, respectively). This result provides a real-world example that these networks with different segmentation performances may potentially provide indistinguishably adequate registration accuracies to assist prostate cancer imaging applications. We conclude by recommending that the differences in the accuracy of downstream image analysis tasks that make use of data output by automatic segmentation methods, such as CNNs, within a clinical pipeline should be taken into account when selecting between different network architectures, in addition to reporting the segmentation accuracy.""","""['Nooshin Ghavami', 'Yipeng Hu', 'Eli Gibson', 'Ester Bonmati', 'Mark Emberton', 'Caroline M Moore', 'Dean C Barratt']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Med Image Anal""","""['Fully automatic, multiorgan segmentation in normal whole body magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), using classification forests (CFs), convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and a multi-atlas (MA) approach.', 'Accurate and robust deep learning-based segmentation of the prostate clinical target volume in ultrasound images.', 'Superpixel-based deep convolutional neural networks and active contour model for automatic prostate segmentation on 3D MRI scans.', 'Fully automatic segmentation on prostate MR images based on cascaded fully convolution network.', 'Investigation and benchmarking of U-Nets on prostate segmentation tasks.', 'Meta-Learning Initializations for Interactive Medical Image Registration.', 'A review of artificial intelligence in prostate cancer detection on imaging.', 'Segmentation of the prostate, its zones, anterior fibromuscular stroma, and urethra on the MRIs and multimodality image fusion using U-Net model.', 'Semi-Automatic Prostate Segmentation From Ultrasound Images Using Machine Learning and Principal Curve Based on Interpretable Mathematical Model Expression.', 'Extrathyroidal Extension Prediction of Papillary Thyroid Cancer With Computed Tomography Based Radiomics Nomogram: A Multicenter Study.']"""

We examined the association of infertility history (inability to conceive for 1 year or greater) of all-cause and cause-specific mortality using disease risk score-adjusted Cox-proportional hazard regression models.  Results:   Infertile women had a 10% increased risk of death (from any cause) during the study period compared with the unexposed (adjusted hazard risk, 1.10, 95% confidence interval, 1.02-1.18, P = .010).

Current anticancer chemotherapeutics are often administrated at suboptimal doses because of nonspecific toxicities to normal tissues, resulting in the eventual failure of therapy as well as the development of drug resistance and metastatic disease. Therefore, ligand-targeted therapeutics have the great potential of improving the selective anticancer toxicity. Integrins β3 (αvβ3 and αIIbβ3) are an important cell adhesion molecular family, overexpressed on both cell membrane and perinuclear region of prostate cancer cells, and play a key role in the progression and metastasis of prostate cancer, making them an attractive target for anticancer therapy. However, their clinical impacts have been limited due to lack of specific ligands. Here, for the first time, we have identified a peptide Arginine-Tryptophan-(D-Arginine)-Asparagine-Arginine as an integrins β3 specific ligand, named B3int, which shows superior selectivity to integrins β3 over other integrin subunits. B3int has high affinity to integrins β3 with a Kd value of 0.2 nM, which is 7-fold higher than c-RGDyK (1.4 nM), a well-established integrin αvβ3 ligand. In addition, B3int shows high specificity for integrins β3, and can selectively target integrin β3 overexpressed cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. Most importantly, B3int-modified liposomes (B3int-LS-DOX) can selectively deliver DOX not only into prostate cancer cells, but into nucleus via targeting integrins β3, thereby significantly improving anticancer effects in 2D prostate cancer cells and 3D tumor spheroids. Particularly, B3int-LS-DOX effectively inhibits tumor growth with an effective dose of as low as 1.5 mg/kg, which is 3.3-fold less than c-RGDyK-LS-DOX (5 mg/kg), indicating that integrins β3 specific therapy is a promising anticancer strategy which can greatly improve the anticancer therapeutic index. In summary, we have identified B3int as the first integrins β3 specific ligand with high affinity and specificity, and holds a great potential of improving the diagnosis and treatment for integrins β3-overexpressed cancers.""","""['Lei Zhang', 'Xue Shan', 'Xia Meng', 'Tingting Gu', 'Qiangbing Lu', 'Jikang Zhang', 'Jiao Chen', 'Qing Jiang', 'Xinghai Ning']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Biomaterials""","""['Biological and molecular properties of a new alpha(v)beta3/alpha(v)beta5 integrin antagonist.', 'The ligand recognition specificity of beta3 integrins.', 'Beta3 integrins facilitate matrix interactions during transendothelial migration of PC3 prostate tumor cells.', 'The Possible Importance of β3 Integrins for Leukemogenesis and Chemoresistance in Acute Myeloid Leukemia.', 'The role of β3-integrins in tumor angiogenesis: context is everything.', ""Let's Go 3D!

Despite being important to recognise, the clinical features of NEPC are poorly defined and could help guide when to perform a biopsy to look for NEPC histologic transformation.  Methods:   We reviewed baseline, treatment and outcome data of 87 patients with metastatic prostate cancer and tumour biopsy confirming NEPC histology. Forty-seven (54.0%) NEPC cases presented de novo, and 40 (46.0%) were therapy-related (t-NEPC). Thirty-six (41.4%) were classified as pure small-cell carcinoma, and 51 (58.6%) demonstrated mixed features with both small-cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma present. Genomic data were available for 47 patients.  Results:   The median age at time of NEPC was 68.1 years, median prostate-specific antigen (PSA) was 1.20 ng/ml (0.14 ng/mL small-cell carcinoma, 1.55 ng/mL mixed carcinoma) and sites of metastases included bone (72.6%), lymph node (47.0%), and viscera (65.5%). Median time from adenocarcinoma to t-NEPC diagnosis was 39.7 months (range, 24.5-93.8) with a median of two lines of prior systemic therapy. Platinum chemotherapy was used to treat 57.5% of patients, with a median progression-free survival of 3.9 months. Small-cell carcinoma was associated with worse overall survival (OS) than mixed histology (8.9 months from NEPC diagnosis versus 26.1 months, P < 0.001). Median OS of de novo NEPC was shorter than that of t-NEPC (16.8 months from prostate cancer diagnosis versus 53.5 months, P = 0.043). An average PSA rise per month of ≤0.7 ng/ml before t-NEPC; elevated lactate dehydrogenase levels, RB1 and TP53 loss and liver metastases were poor prognostic features.  Conclusions:   We describe the clinical features of a cohort of patients with NEPC.

RNA polymerase I (Pol I) is the enzyme responsible for ribosomal RNA (rRNA) transcription and a rate-limiting step for ribosome biogenesis. We have shown using a specific and sensitive RNA probe for the 45S rRNA precursor that rRNA synthesis is increased in prostate adenocarcinoma compared to nonmalignant epithelium. We have introduced a first-in-class Pol I inhibitor, BMH-21, that targets cancer cells of multiple origins, and holds potential for clinical translation.  Methods:   The effect of BMH-21 was tested in prostate cancer cell lines and in prostate cancer xenograft and mouse genetic models.  Results:   We show that BMH-21 inhibits Pol I transcription in metastatic, castration-resistant, and enzalutamide treatment-resistant prostate cancer cell lines. The genetic abrogation of Pol I effectively blocks the growth of prostate cancer cells. Silencing of p53, a pathway activated downstream of Pol I, does not diminish this effect. We find that BMH-21 significantly inhibited tumor growth and reduced the Ki67 proliferation index in an enzalutamide-resistant xenograft tumor model. A decrease in 45S rRNA synthesis demonstrated on-target activity. Furthermore, the Pol I inhibitor significantly inhibited tumor growth and pathology in an aggressive genetically modified Hoxb13-MYC|Hoxb13-Cre|Ptenfl/fl (BMPC) mouse prostate cancer model.  Conclusion:   Taken together, BMH-21 is a novel promising molecule for the treatment of castration-resistant prostate cancer.""","""['Jin-Yih Low', 'Paul Sirajuddin', 'Michael Moubarek', 'Shreya Agarwal', 'Apurv Rege', 'Gunes Guner', 'Hester Liu', 'Zhiming Yang', 'Angelo M De Marzo', 'Charles Bieberich', 'Marikki Laiho']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Patient-derived Models of Abiraterone- and Enzalutamide-resistant Prostate Cancer Reveal Sensitivity to Ribosome-directed Therapy.', 'The Dual Inhibition of RNA Pol I Transcription and PIM Kinase as a New Therapeutic Approach to Treat Advanced Prostate Cancer.', 'Targeting CPT1B as a potential therapeutic strategy in castration-resistant and enzalutamide-resistant prostate cancer.', 'The evolving role of enzalutamide on the treatment of prostate cancer.', 'New approaches to targeting epigenetic regulation in prostate cancer.', 'Small molecule-mediated disruption of ribosome biogenesis synergizes with FGFR inhibitors to suppress glioma cell growth.', 'CACYBP knockdown inhibits progression of prostate cancer via p53.', 'Regulation of RNA Polymerase I Stability and Function.', 'Ribosome-Directed Therapies in Cancer.', 'Targeting Ribosome Biogenesis in Cancer: Lessons Learned and Way Forward.']"""

Methods:   We analyzed the data of 291 patients who underwent radical prostatectomy (RP) for a cT1-2N0 prostate cancer in a single surgeon series. All patients underwent preoperative staging with mpMRI. PIRADS v2 was used for characterizing lesions. The role of capsular abutment or bulging was tested in a multivariable logistic regression adjusting for prostate-specific antigen and highest ipsilateral biopsy Gleason grade. The presence of focal versus extensive extracapsular extension (ECE) was investigated.  Results:   Overall, ECE on final pathology was documented in 35 (12%) cases and ECE was focal in 32 (91%) patients. Overall, mpMRI demonstrated capsule bulging or abutment in 12 (24%) cases. After adjusting for confounders, capsule bulging or abutment on mpMRI emerged as predictor for ECE (OR=6.70; 95% CI: 2.97-15.12, P<0.001). The sensitivity and specificity of capsule abutment or bulging in predicting ECE were 43% and 95%, respectively. Sensitivity and specificity were 36% and 48% respectively to predict focal ECE.

Preclinical studies suggest that Akt-driven CaP cells are genetically susceptible to mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR, or TORC1) inhibition. Everolimus is a Food and Drug Administration-approved inhibitor of TORC1.  Materials and methods:   We performed a phase II study of everolimus in patients with mCRPC, who were refractory to standard of care hormonal and chemotherapeutic agents. Patients received everolimus 10 mg daily until unacceptable adverse events or disease progression. The primary efficacy outcome was confirmed 50% or greater prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response, using a 2 stage design with futility rules. Paired biopsies were utilized to assess for treatment effect on downstream TORC1 targets as well as tumor cell proliferation and apoptosis.  Results:   Out of 35 men enrolled with heavily pretreated mCRPC, 32 were evaluable for clinical efficacy. No PSA responses were observed, the median progression-free survival time was 3.6 months (95% confidence interval = 2.9-4.8) and the median overall survival time was 10.4 months (95% confidence interval = 5.8-15.8). Several patients had declines in serum PSA upon cessation of everolimus. Thus, the study was closed due to clinical futility. The most common toxicities were mucositis, fatigue, anorexia, hypertriglyceridemia, and thrombocytopenia and were largely low grade. Pathologic evaluation of paired metastatic biopsies demonstrated consistent inhibition of pS6, a downstream mTOR pharmacodynamics biomarker, but the tumor proliferation marker Ki-67 increased with therapy.  Conclusions:   Everolimus demonstrated predictable toxicity in advanced and heavily pretreated patients with mCRPC.

Clinical and laboratory variables were obtained and evaluated among both study groups. Analysis of serum PSA and plasma zinc was done under standard protocols.Results: No age difference (cases: 69.73 ± 7.72 vs controls: 68.97 ± 7.32; P > 0.05) was observed among both study groups. Prevalence of zinc deficiency among PCa and control groups was 69.1% and 21.8%, respectively. Zinc deficiency was more prevalent among the elderly PCa patients (n = 119; 78.3%) compared to elderly controls. Higher proportion (n = 136; 89.5%) of zinc-deficient PCa patients presented with moderate-severe PCa disease. Elderly PCa patients (n = 119; 81.0%) predominated among those exhibiting moderate-severe PCa disease.

Methods:   A retrospective cohort study was conducted on prostatectomy specimens from the prostate cancer database of a single large Australian pathology practice which services a large proportion of hospitals within 1 state. Data were extracted regarding the pathological characteristics of the cancers and a univariate analysis was conducted against 2 age cutoffs.  Results:   Data were extracted for all prostatectomy specimens between 2011 and 2017 in 11,551 men. One hundred and thirty-two men were 45 years old and younger, and 545 were 50 years old and younger. Statistically significant differences were found in a number of pathological characteristics. Younger men had lower grade group disease, and within that had less adverse pathological characteristics. In particular, even after controlling for confounding in men 45 and younger, in Grade Group 2 disease there was a lower risk of extra prostatic extension (17.5% vs 34.4%, P = .003), and lymph node involvement (0% vs 0.8%, P = .006), with trends toward superiority in other domains.

Methylome analysis, CpG island arrays and Hierarchical clustering were used to analyze methylation profiles of PCa tissues. MTSS1 methylation level was detected by methylation-specific PCR. Relative messenger RNA and the expression level of MTSS1 protein were identified by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) and western blot analysis. The migration, invasion, proliferation, and cell cycle were detected separately by wound-healing assay, transwell chamber assay, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide assay and flow cytometry. The roles of MTSS1 in PCa progression were demonstrated in vivo by tumor formation assays in nude mice. MTSS1 expression was decreased in PCa tissues in comparison with paired adjacent normal prostate tissues. Compared to the methylation of MTSS1 in normal prostate tissues based on the MethHC website, the MTSS1 in PCa tissues was hypermethylated. The expression of MTSS1 detected by qRT-PCR and western blot analysis was found to be downregulated in PCa cells and tissues. The reduced expression of MTSS1 by small interfering RNA-MTSS1 was recovered by 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine treatment. Besides, MTSS1 demethylation inhibited migration, invasion, and proliferation of PCa cells, and induced cell cycle to be arrested at G0/G1 phase. Furthermore, it was shown by tumor xenograft assay that MTSS1 inhibited the growth of tumor in vivo. Hypermethylated MTSS1 promoted PCa cells migration, invasion, and proliferation, and suppressed cell cycle arrest at the G0/G1 phase.""","""['Junjie Chen', 'Liang Huang', 'Quan Zhu', 'Zhao Wang', 'Zhengyan Tang']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""J Cell Physiol""","""['PON1 hypermethylation is associated with progression of renal cell carcinoma.', 'Inactivation of ADAMTS18 by aberrant promoter hypermethylation contribute to lung cancer progression.', 'MicroRNA-135b regulates metastasis suppressor 1 expression and promotes migration and invasion in colorectal cancer.', 'ECRG4 acts as a tumor suppressor gene frequently hypermethylated in human breast cancer.', 'MTSS1: a multifunctional protein and its role in cancer invasion and metastasis.', 'Prognostic value and immunological role of BAIAP2L2 in liver hepatocellular carcinoma: A pan-cancer analysis.', ""The Differential Antitumor Activity of 5-Aza-2'-deoxycytidine in Prostate Cancer DU145, 22RV1, and LNCaP Cells."", 'Downregulation of MTSS1 in acute myeloid leukemia is associated with a poor prognosis, chemotherapy resistance, and disease aggressiveness.', 'Genomic and Functional Regulation of TRIB1 Contributes to Prostate Cancer Pathogenesis.']"""

GOLPH2 is prominently overexpressed in hepatocellular carcinoma, melanoma, glioblastoma, prostate, lung, and colorectal cancer. With a low and tightly regulated expression in non-malignant tissues, GOLPH2 has been proposed as an attractive target for cancer therapy. However, GOLPH2 is predominantly located intracellularly and when situated outside of the cell it is proteolytically cleaved and shed from the cell surface. Until now, GOLPH2 has been regarded as an ""undruggable"" target.  Objective:   We sought to create antibodies that specifically bind to GOLPH2 overexpressing tumor cells.  Patients and methods:   Antibodies binding to membranous GOLPH2 despite shedding of the protein were generated from a scFV library screening. These antibodies target the part of GOLPH2 that remains at the cell surface after proteolytic cleavage. These antibodies were then tested in vitro and in vivo.  Results:   Two candidates (G2-1 and G2-2) showed target specific binding in vitro. Utilizing a tumor array (n = 128 tumors) with G2-2 and a reference antibody, a GOLPH2 expression scoring system was established. Rapid internalization of the antibodies was noted so this was exploited to deliver a toxic payload of pyrrolobenzodiazepine (PBD). In two patient-derived xenograft (PDX)-models, colorectal and lung cancer, the G2-2 antibody drug conjugate (ADC) displayed high efficacy with significant tumor responses (P = 0.001; P = 0.013) and improved survival (P = 0.0001; P = 0.0011) compared with controls.

The phantom enables simultaneous irradiation at multiple positions along the beam path. The main purpose of this study was the detailed dosimetric characterization of the phantom which consists of various heterogeneous structures. The dosimetric measurements described here were performed under non-reference conditions. The experiment involved a CT scan of the phantom, dose calculations performed with the treatment planning system (TPS) RayStation employing both the Pencil Beam (PB) and Monte Carlo (MC) algorithms, and proton beam delivery. Two treatment plans reflecting the typical target location for head and neck cancer and prostate cancer treatment were created. Absorbed dose to water and dose homogeneity were experimentally assessed within the phantom along the Bragg curve with ionization chambers (ICs) and EBT3 films. LETd distributions were obtained from the TPS. Measured depth dose distributions were in good agreement with the Monte Carlo-based TPS data. Absorbed dose calculated with the PB algorithm was 4% higher than the absorbed dose measured with ICs at the deepest measurement point along the spread-out Bragg peak. Results of experiments using melanoma (SKMel) cell line are also presented. The study suggested a pronounced correlation between the relative biological effectiveness (RBE) and LETd, where higher LETd leads to elevated cell death and cell inactivation. Obtained RBE values ranged from 1.4 to 1.8 at the survival level of 10% (RBE10). It is concluded that dosimetric characterization of a phantom before its use for RBE experiments is essential, since a high dosimetric accuracy contributes to reliable RBE data and allows for a clearer differentiation between physical and biological uncertainties.""","""['Monika Clausen', 'Suphalak Khachonkham', 'Sylvia Gruber', 'Peter Kuess', 'Rolf Seemann', 'Barbara Knäusl', 'Elisabeth Mara', 'Hugo Palmans', 'Wolfgang Dörr', 'Dietmar Georg']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Radiat Environ Biophys""","""['Investigating the impact of alpha/beta and LETd on relative biological effectiveness in scanned proton beams: An in vitro study based on human cell lines.', 'Validation of linear energy transfer computed in a Monte Carlo dose engine of a commercial treatment planning system.', 'Benchmarking a GATE/Geant4 Monte Carlo model for proton beams in magnetic fields.', 'Advanced Proton Beam Dosimetry Part I: review and performance evaluation of dose calculation algorithms.', ""Introduction to the EC's Marie Curie Initial Training Network Project: The European Training Network in Digital Medical Imaging for Radiotherapy (ENTERVISION)."", 'Characterization of GafChromic EBT2 film dose measurements using a tissue-equivalent water phantom for a Theratron® Equinox Cobalt-60 teletherapy machine.', 'Ganetespib selectively sensitizes cancer cells for proximal and distal spread-out Bragg peak proton irradiation.', 'A method for time-independent film dosimetry: Can we obtain accurate patient-specific QA results at any time postirradiation?', 'Activation of efficient DNA repair mechanisms after photon and proton irradiation of human chondrosarcoma cells.', 'Simulation of dose distribution and secondary particle production in proton therapy of brain tumor.']"""

Methods: This was a retrospective analysis of 388 prostate cancer patients enrolled in 5 prospective studies (NCT02940262, NCT03368547, NCT03042312, NCT04050215, and NCT03515577). All underwent 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT scans acquired from vertex to toes for primary staging (n = 93/388, 24%), biochemical recurrence (BCR) localization (n = 225/388, 58%), or restaging metastatic disease (M1) before or during systemic therapy (n = 70/388, 18%) between September 2017 and May 2018. Results: In total, 321 of 388 patients (83%) had a positive 68Ga-PSMA-11 study. PSMA-positive bone lesions were found in 105 of 388 (27%) patients, with an incidence that was positively associated with serum PSA level (<10 ng/mL, 21%; 10-20 ng/mL, 41%; ≥20 ng/mL, 41%; P < 0.001). This association was maintained for all 3 indications: initial staging, BCR, and restaging M1. Bone metastases occurred most frequently in restaging M1, followed by BCR and initial staging. Bone metastasis incidence was not significantly associated with National Comprehensive Cancer Network risk score (P = 0.22). The average number of PSMA-positive regions also increased with serum PSA level (P < 0.001). Eighteen of 388 (5%) and 18 of 388 (5%) had lesions above the superior orbital ridge and below the proximal third of the femur, respectively. There was only 1 of 388 patients (0.26%) in whom the total-body PET acquisition had an impact on management. Conclusion: Bone metastases as assessed with 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT are prevalent even in patients with low serum PSA levels. Therefore, current guidelines for bone assessments in prostate cancer patients should be revisited because 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT may provide additional information for accurate bone staging at low serum PSA levels. Including the total body (from vertex to toes) in 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT imaging revealed additional bone lesions in 6% of patients, but without significantly affecting patient management.""","""['Kelsey L Pomykala', 'Johannes Czernin', 'Tristan R Grogan', 'Wesley R Armstrong', 'John Williams', 'Jeremie Calais']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""J Nucl Med""","""['More advantages in detecting bone and soft tissue metastases from prostate cancer using 18F-PSMA PET/CT.', '68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT derived quantitative volumetric tumor parameters for classification and evaluation of therapeutic response of bone metastases in prostate cancer patients.', '68Ga-Labeled Prostate-specific Membrane Antigen Ligand Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography for Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.', 'Use of gallium-68 prostate-specific membrane antigen positron-emission tomography for detecting lymph node metastases in primary and recurrent prostate cancer and location of recurrence after radical prostatectomy: an overview of the current literature.', 'Sensitivity, Specificity, and Predictors of Positive 68Ga-Prostate-specific Membrane Antigen Positron Emission Tomography in Advanced Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.', 'Unambiguous radiologic extranodal extension determined by MRI could be a biomarker in predicting metastatic prostate cancer.', 'Peptide Modification Diminishes HLA Class II-restricted CD4+ T Cell Recognition of Prostate Cancer Cells.', 'The Role of PSMA PET/CT in the Primary Diagnosis and Follow-Up of Prostate Cancer-A Practical Clinical Review.', 'Predictors of Bone Metastases at 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT in Hormone-Sensitive Prostate Cancer (HSPC) Patients with Early Biochemical Recurrence or Persistence.', 'Role of Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen PET in Metastatic Prostate Cancer: We Have the Answers.']"""

On labeling with the short-lived isotopes 18F and 68Ga, excellent molecular imaging performance is achieved. This potential could be further exploited using long-lived isotopes. Because of the favorable half-life of 64Cu, tracers labeled with this PET nuclide could solve logistic problems. Moreover, this isotope provides a theranostic pair with the therapeutic copper isotope 67Cu. Hence, 9 novel tracers that combine dedicated copper chelators with the PSMA-specific urea-based binding motif were developed. Methods: The precursors were obtained by solid-phase synthesis. The purity and molecular weight of the PSMA ligands were confirmed by high-performance liquid chromatography and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. The compounds were labeled with 64Cu, with a radiolabeling yield of more than 99%. Competitive cell binding assays and internalization assays were performed with C4-2 cells, a subline of the PSMA-positive cell line LNCaP (human lymph node carcinoma of the prostate). In vitro serum stability, the stability of 64Cu-CA003 in blood, and the in vivo fate of neat 64Cu-chloride or 64Cu-CA003 were determined to prove whether the stability of the radiolabeled compounds is sufficient to ensure no significant loss of copper during the targeting process. For PET imaging and biodistribution studies, a C4-2 tumor-bearing mouse model was used. Results: The radiolabeled 64Cu-PSMA ligands showed high serum stability. All PSMA ligands showed high inhibition potencies, with equilibrium inhibition constants in the low nanomolar range. 64Cu-CA003 and 64Cu-CA005 showed high internalization ratios (34.6% ± 2.8 and 18.6% ± 4.4, respectively). Both the in vitro serum stability determination and the in vivo characterization of the main radiolabeled compounds confirmed that, except for 64Cu-PSMA-617, all compounds showed high serum stability within the observation period of 24 h. Small-animal PET imaging demonstrated high tumor uptake within 20 min. Organ distribution studies confirmed high specific uptake in the tumor, with 30.8 ± 12.6 percentage injected dose (%ID)/g at 1 h after injection. Rapid clearance from the kidneys was observed-a decrease from 67.0 ± 20.9 %ID/g at 1 h after injection to 7.5 ± 8.51 %ID/g at 24 h after injection (in the case of CA003). The performance of CA003, the compound with the best preclinical properties, was assessed in a first patient. In line with its preclinical data, PET imaging resulted in clear visualization of the cancer lesions, with high contrast. Conclusion: The 64Cu-labeled PSMA ligands are promising agents to target PSMA and visualize PSMA-positive tumor lesions as shown in preclinical evaluation by small-animal PET studies, organ distribution, and a patient application. Most importantly, the images obtained at 20 h enabled delineation of unclear lesions, showing that the compounds fulfill the prerequisite for dosimetry in the course of therapy planning with 67Cu.

Moderate hypofractionation has been shown to be non-inferior to conventional fractionation. Ultra-hypofractionated stereotactic body radiotherapy would allow shorter treatment courses but could increase acute toxicity compared with conventionally fractionated or moderately hypofractionated radiotherapy. We report the acute toxicity findings from a randomised trial of standard-of-care conventionally fractionated or moderately hypofractionated radiotherapy versus five-fraction stereotactic body radiotherapy for low-risk to intermediate-risk localised prostate cancer.  Methods:   PACE is an international, phase 3, open-label, randomised, non-inferiority trial. In PACE-B, eligible men aged 18 years and older, with WHO performance status 0-2, low-risk or intermediate-risk prostate adenocarcinoma (Gleason 4 + 3 excluded), and scheduled to receive radiotherapy were recruited from 37 centres in three countries (UK, Ireland, and Canada). Participants were randomly allocated (1:1) by computerised central randomisation with permuted blocks (size four and six), stratified by centre and risk group, to conventionally fractionated or moderately hypofractionated radiotherapy (78 Gy in 39 fractions over 7·8 weeks or 62 Gy in 20 fractions over 4 weeks, respectively) or stereotactic body radiotherapy (36·25 Gy in five fractions over 1-2 weeks). Neither participants nor investigators were masked to allocation. Androgen deprivation was not permitted. The primary endpoint of PACE-B is freedom from biochemical or clinical failure. The coprimary outcomes for this acute toxicity substudy were worst grade 2 or more severe Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) gastrointestinal or genitourinary toxic effects score up to 12 weeks after radiotherapy. Analysis was per protocol. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01584258. PACE-B recruitment is complete and follow-up is ongoing.  Findings:   Between Aug 7, 2012, and Jan 4, 2018, we randomly assigned 874 men to conventionally fractionated or moderately hypofractionated radiotherapy (n=441) or stereotactic body radiotherapy (n=433). 432 (98%) of 441 patients allocated to conventionally fractionated or moderately hypofractionated radiotherapy and 415 (96%) of 433 patients allocated to stereotactic body radiotherapy received at least one fraction of allocated treatment. Worst acute RTOG gastrointestinal toxic effect proportions were as follows: grade 2 or more severe toxic events in 53 (12%) of 432 patients in the conventionally fractionated or moderately hypofractionated radiotherapy group versus 43 (10%) of 415 patients in the stereotactic body radiotherapy group (difference -1·9 percentage points, 95% CI -6·2 to 2·4; p=0·38). Worst acute RTOG genitourinary toxicity proportions were as follows: grade 2 or worse toxicity in 118 (27%) of 432 patients in the conventionally fractionated or moderately hypofractionated radiotherapy group versus 96 (23%) of 415 patients in the stereotactic body radiotherapy group (difference -4·2 percentage points, 95% CI -10·0 to 1·7; p=0·16). No treatment-related deaths occurred.  Interpretation:   Previous evidence (from the HYPO-RT-PC trial) suggested higher patient-reported toxicity with ultrahypofractionation.

The vertebral column is the most common site of cancer metastasis, however predilection of metastases for the spine is not fully understood.  Objective:   The aim of the present investigation was to obtain a better description of the distribution of spinal metastases. The main objective of our study was to figure out how malignant cells disseminate within the spine and determine a potent mapping or profile of the metastatic spread routes.  Study design:   A prospective French national multicenter database.  Methods:   740 consecutive patients were treated for spine metastasis (SpM) between January 2014 and 2017. A categorisation of the anatomical distribution of spine lesions was conducted.  Results:   One hundred and seventy patients (22.9% of series) presented cervical SpM, 440 (60%) lumbar SpM, and a majority 530 (71.6%) at the thoracic vertebral level. Metastases were more often present in the vertebral body (645 patients, 87.2%) than in a posterior location (278 patients, 37.6%, p < 0.0001). 212/740 patients (28.6%) presented circumferential spine involvement (body and posterior elements). An associated epiduritis was presented in 404 patients (54.6%). Primitive neck tumors spread towards the cervical spine: ENT (34.8%, p = 0.049), thyroid (33.3%, p = 0.043) whereas pelvic tumors targeted the lumbar spine: prostate (72%, p = 0.011), bladder (75%, p = 0.047). All tumors presented a tropism for thoracic vertebrae. Significant tumor/vertebrae associations were identified: lung (p = 0.004) and thyroid (p = 0.028) for L1, bladder for L5 (p = 0.0025), breast for C6 (p = 0.006), Prostate for L1-L4 (p = 0.002-0.04), multiple myelomas for C7, p = 0.03, T3-T7 (p < 0.0001-0.025) and L1-L4 (p = 0.004-0.027). Spine was the latest organ affected by metastases with a median-free survival of 4.2 months (SD 1.8, p = 0.001).  Conclusions:   Although we determined that some tumors have a significant propensity to localise at certain vertebral level, it remains premature to conclude on a spinal metastases profile. To date, it is too early to provide recommendations in imaging follow-up or in preventive therapeutic based on this mapping of spine metastases.""","""['Aymeric Amelot', 'Louis-Marie Terrier', 'Joseph Cristini', 'Louis-Romée LeNail', 'Kévin Buffenoir', 'Hugues Pascal-Moussellard', 'Raphael Bonaccorsi', 'Bertrand Mathon']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Surg Oncol""","""['Predominance of Spinal Metastases Involving the Posterior Vertebral Body.', 'Does the Region of the Spine Involved with Metastatic Tumor Affect Outcomes of Surgical Treatments?', 'Risk factors and probability of vertebral body collapse in metastases of the thoracic and lumbar spine.', 'Current concept on spine metastases management.', 'Treatment of metastases of thoracic and lumbar vertebrae with predominant corporeal involvement by osteotomy of the vertebral body and anterior approach with cement and screwed plate.', 'Multidisciplinary Approach to Spinal Metastases and Metastatic Spinal Cord Compression-A New Integrative Flowchart for Patient Management.', 'Cross-link augmentation enhances CFR-PEEK short fixation in lumbar metastasis stabilization.', 'Biological and Clinical Aspects of Metastatic Spinal Tumors.', 'The effects of combined microwave ablation and open surgery for the treatment of lung cancer-derived thoracolumbar metastases.', 'Clinical utility of convolutional neural networks for treatment planning in radiotherapy for spinal metastases.']"""

The expression of miR-615-3p was measured in PC tissue specimens from 239 men who underwent radical prostatectomy (RP), and it was investigated if miR-615-3p could predict postoperative biochemical recurrence (BCR). These findings were subsequently validated in three independent RP cohorts (n = 222, n = 273, and n = 387) and functional overexpression studies conducted in PC cells (PC3M). High miR-615-3p expression was significantly associated with BCR in four independent PC patient cohorts (P < 0.05, log-rank test). In addition, high miR-615-3p expression was a significant predictor of PC-specific survival in univariate (hazard ratio, 3.75; P < 0.001) and multivariate (hazard ratio, 2.66; P = 0.008) analysis after adjustment for the Cancer of the Prostate Risk Assessment Post-Surgical (CAPRA-S) nomogram in a merged RP cohort (n = 734).

However, our understanding of the immediate targets that are key to the growth inhibitory effects of MSA remains limited. Here, using multiple preclinical prostate cancer models, we demonstrated in vitro and in vivo that GDF15 is a most highly induced, immediate target of MSA. We further showed that knockdown of GDF15 mitigates MSA inhibition of cell proliferation and induction of apoptosis. Analysis of gene expression data from over 1000 primary and 200 metastatic prostate cancer samples revealed that GDF15 expression is decreased in metastatic prostate cancers compared to primary tumors and that lower GDF15 levels in primary tumors are associated with higher Gleason scores and shorter survival of the patients. Additionally, pathways that are negatively correlated with GDF15 levels in clinical samples are also negatively correlated with MSA treatment in cultured cells. Since most, if not all, of these pathways have been implicated in prostate cancer progression, suppressing their activities by inducing GDF15 is consistent with the anticancer effects of MSA in prostate cancer. Overall, this study provides support for GDF15 as an immediate target of MSA in prostate cancer cells.""","""['Wenbo Zhang', 'Cheng Hu', 'Xiaojie Wang', 'Shanshan Bai', 'Subing Cao', 'Margaret Kobelski', 'James R Lambert', 'Jingkai Gu', 'Yang Zhan']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Diverse effects of methylseleninic acid on the transcriptional program of human prostate cancer cells.', 'Growth differentiation factor-15 upregulates interleukin-6 to promote tumorigenesis of prostate carcinoma PC-3 cells.', 'Methylseleninic acid enhances the effect of etoposide to inhibit prostate cancer growth in vivo.', 'Growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF15) in cancer cell metastasis: from the cells to the patients.', 'Functional roles of GDF15 in modulating microenvironment to promote carcinogenesis.', 'Seleno-Metabolites and Their Precursors: A New Dawn for Several Illnesses?', 'Clinical usefulness and acceleratory effect of macrophage inhibitory cytokine-1 on biliary tract cancer: an experimental biomarker analysis.', 'Deletion of Gdf15 Reduces ER Stress-induced Beta-cell Apoptosis and Diabetes.', 'Emerging roles of growth differentiation factor-15 in brain disorders (Review).', 'GDF15 knockdown suppresses cervical cancer cell migration in\xa0vitro through the TGF-β/Smad2/3/Snail1 pathway.']"""

Although there are a large number of clinical studies on the treatment of patients with prostate cancer, many patients have entered the advanced stage of diagnosis, and little is known about its pathogenesis.  Materials and methods:   We identified a series of ncRNA and TF by differential expression analysis, co-expression analysis, enrichment analysis, connectivity analysis, and hypergeometric test strategies for prostate cancer expression genomes.  Results:   53 modules related to prostate cancer PC-3 cells were obtained, involving module focusing of 4448 genes. Based on these modules, we predicted that miR-26a-5p, miR-130a-3p, miR-519d-3p, etc. have important regulatory effects on prostate cancer PC-3 cells. At the same time, a series of transcription factors (relating to RELA, SOX10, TP53, and TWIST2, etc.) were obtained and may play a key regulatory role in prostate cancer PC-3 cell-related modules.

Apalutamide is associated with an increased incidence of skin rash above the placebo groups in the SPARTAN trial in nmCRPC and in the TITAN trial in metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer patients. On the contrary, the rate of skin rash across all clinical trials (including PROSPER [nmCRPC]) for enzalutamide is similar to the placebo. We hypothesized that the apalutamide-associated increased skin rash in patients could be linked to a structural difference. The 2-cyanophenyl and dimethyl moieties in enzalutamide are substituted in apalutamide with 2-cyanopyridine and cyclobutyl, respectively. In our evaluations, the 2-cyanopyridine moiety of apalutamide was chemically reactive with the thiol nucleophile glutathione, resulting in rearranged thiazoline products. Radiolabeled apalutamide, but not radiolabeled enzalutamide, was shown to react with mouse and human plasma proteins. Thiol nucleophiles decreased the extent of covalent binding to the model protein bovine serum albumin, whereas amine and alcohol nucleophiles had no effect, suggesting reactivity with cysteine of proteins. Subcutaneous administration of apalutamide dose dependently increased lymphocyte cellularity in draining lymph nodes in a mouse drug allergy model (MDAM). Enzalutamide, and its known analogue RD162 in which the cyanophenyl was retained but the dimethyl was replaced by cyclobutyl, demonstrated substantially less covalent binding activity and negative results in the MDAM assay. Collectively, these data support the hypothesis that the 2-cyanopyridine moiety in apalutamide may react with cysteine in proteins forming haptens, which may trigger an immune response, as indicated by the activity of apalutamide in the MDAM assay, which in turn may be leading to increased potential for skin rash versus placebo in patients in the SPARTAN and TITAN clinical trials.""","""['Changhua Ji', 'Mausumee Guha', 'Xu Zhu', 'Jessica Whritenour', 'Michelle Hemkens', 'Susanna Tse', 'Gregory S Walker', 'Ellen Evans', 'Nasir K Khan', 'Martin B Finkelstein', 'Ernesto Callegari', 'R Scott Obach']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Chem Res Toxicol""","""['Matching-Adjusted Indirect Comparison of the Efficacy of Apalutamide and Enzalutamide with ADT in the Treatment of Non-Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Matching-Adjusted Indirect Comparison of Health-Related Quality of Life and Adverse Events of Apalutamide Versus Enzalutamide in Non-Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Management of Nonmetastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer: Recent Advances and Future Direction.', 'Matching-adjusted indirect treatment comparison of the efficacy of enzalutamide versus apalutamide for the treatment of nonmetastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Apalutamide for the treatment of prostate cancer.', 'Pharmacokinetic Interactions Between Abiraterone, Apalutamide, Darolutamide or Enzalutamide and Antithrombotic Drugs: Prediction of Clinical Events and Review of Pharmacological Information.', 'A retrospective study on the incidence, management and risk factors of skin rash in patients with advanced prostate cancer in Japan.', 'Novel hormonal therapies in the management of advanced prostate cancer: extrapolating Asian findings to Southeast Asia.', 'GSTM2 is a key molecular determinant of resistance to SG-ARIs.', 'Dermatological Adverse Events in Prostate Cancer Patients Treated with the Androgen Receptor Inhibitor Apalutamide.']"""

However, MBIR reduces noise while preserving edges which may impact intensity-based tasks such as auto-segmentation. This work evaluates the sensitivity of an auto-contouring prostate atlas across multiple MBIR reconstruction protocols and benchmarks the results against filtered back projection (FBP). Images were created from raw projection data for 11 prostate cancer cases using FBP and nine different MBIR reconstructions (3 protocols/3 noise reduction levels) yielding 10 reconstructions/patient. Five bony structures, bladder, rectum, prostate, and seminal vesicles (SVs) were segmented using an auto-segmentation pipeline that renders 3D binary masks for analysis. Performance was evaluated for volume percent difference (VPD) and Dice similarity coefficient (DSC), using FBP as the gold standard. Nonparametric Friedman tests plus post hoc all pairwise comparisons were employed to test for significant differences (P < 0.05) for soft tissue organs and protocol/level combinations. A physician performed qualitative grading of 396 MBIR contours across the prostate, bladder, SVs, and rectum in comparison to FBP using a six-point scale. MBIR contours agreed with FBP for bony anatomy (DSC ≥ 0.98), bladder (DSC ≥ 0.94, VPD < 8.5%), and prostate (DSC = 0.94 ± 0.03, VPD = 4.50 ± 4.77% (range: 0.07-26.39%).

Over the all protocol/level comparisons, a significant difference was observed for the prostate VPD between BSPL1 and BSTL2 (adjusted P-value = 0.039). Nevertheless, 300 of 396 (75.8%) of the four soft tissue structures using MBIR were graded as equivalent or better than FBP, suggesting that MBIR offered potential improvements in auto-segmentation performance when compared to FBP.

In contrast to previous studies and to maximize its potential public health impact, the intervention targeted 4 screening tests and only participants who were not up to date with screening guidelines for at least 1 cancer. Because CHAs had to both determine baseline adherence and provide counseling on 4 screening tests, the protocol was complex. Complex protocols can reduce implementation fidelity.  Intervention approach:   In partnership with health ministries at 9 African American churches in South Los Angeles, we conducted a 1-group pretest-posttest pilot study to assess the feasibility of implementing the intervention. CHAs recruited and obtained consent from church members aged 50 to 75 years; assessed adherence to national screening guidelines for breast, cervical, colorectal, and prostate cancer; and provided evidence-based strategies (one-on-one counseling, print materials, reminder calls) to encourage screening for tests that were overdue.  Evaluation methods:   We assessed implementation fidelity by reviewing baseline screening assessments and counseling scripts completed by CHAs. We estimated potential effect of the intervention on receipt of screening by using data from 3-month follow-up surveys, conducted by the research team, of participants who were nonadherent at baseline.  Results:   From June 2016 to June 2018, 44 CHAs conducted baseline assessments of 775 participants, of whom 338 (44%) were nonadherent to national guidelines for 1 or more cancer screening tests. CHAs provided counseling to most nonadherent participants. At follow-up, about one-third of participants reported that they had discussed cancer screening with their provider and a smaller proportion reported receipt of a screening test; 13% of men and 25% of women reported receipt of colorectal cancer screening.

Methods:   After IRB approval and patient consultation/education, we performed RTP on 12 consecutive patients who presented with low-risk PCa and significantly enlarged prostate glands with LUTS. Inclusion criteria included patients with suspicion of low-risk malignancy, subjective/objective complaint of LUTS, and pre-operative prostate size > 60 g. Preoperative, perioperative and postoperative variables were studied in the following domains: surgical, oncologic, continence and erectile function.  Results:   A total of 12 patients underwent RTP. Mean preoperative prostate volume and PSA was estimated at 96.96 g and 8.79, respectively. Surgical time, EBL and LOS was estimated at 180.8 min, 189.6 ml, and 2 days, respectively. Post-operative variables confirmed resolution of LUTS (mean PVR 41.78/IPSS 8.3) and efficient oncologic control (mean PSA 0.04), with minimal compromise of sexual function. 100% continence was achieved at 3 months.  Conclusion:   RTP is a novel, efficient surgical procedure for the treatment of patients with at-risk for low-grade malignancy and symptomatic LUTS in an enlarged gland. Expanding the indication to patients with low-risk malignancy, irrespective of prostate size may alleviate the adverse effects of radical treatment in this select subset of patients.""","""['Ram A Pathak', 'Ashok K Hemal']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""World J Urol""","""['Robot-Assisted Simple Prostatectomy: A Comparison of Primary Simple Prostatectomy vs Salvage Simple Prostatectomy in Treatment of Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms.', 'Robot-assisted simple prostatectomy for treatment of lower urinary tract symptoms secondary to benign prostatic enlargement: surgical technique and outcomes in a high-volume robotic centre.', 'Improved lower urinary tract symptoms after robot-assisted radical prostatectomy: implications for survivorship, treatment selection and patient counselling.', 'Robotic assisted simple prostatectomy: recent advances.', 'The Role of Aquablation for the Surgical Treatment of LUTS/BPH.', 'Efficacy and safety evaluation of complete intrafascial prostatectomy in suspected prostate cancer patients with dysuria: a retrospective cohort study.', 'Techniques of robotic radical prostatectomy for the management of prostate cancer: which one, when and why.', 'Robotic surgery in urology: the way forward.']"""

Methods:   We analyzed patients who underwent robot-assisted radical prostatectomy for localized prostate cancer at our institution between July 2015 and April 2017. In these patients, we measured the perfusion quality of the pelvic floor with contrast media kinetics in the preoperative MRI of the prostate and compared the levator ani muscle (region of interest) to the surrounding pelvic muscle structures (reference). Prospectively collected questionnaires regarding urinary incontinence were then evaluated 1 year postoperatively. Outcomes were dichotomized into ""continent"" (ICIQ-Score = 0-5) and ""incontinent"" (ICIQ-Score ≥ 6). In each patient, we determined the perfusion ratio of the levator ani muscle divided by the surrounding pelvic muscle structures and compared them among the groups.  Results:   Forty-two patients were included in the study (n = 22 in ""continent"", n = 20 in ""incontinent"" group). The median perfusion ratio from the continent group was significantly higher compared to the incontinent group (1.61 vs. 1.15; 95% CI 0.09-0.81, p = 0.015). The median perfusion ratio in ""excellent"" (ICIQ-Score = 0) was significantly higher than in ""poor"" (ICIQ-Score ≥ 11) outcomes (1.48 vs. 0.94; 95% CI 0.04-1.03, p = 0.036). Further, a higher perfusion ratio was negatively correlated with ICIQ-Score (r = - 0.33; 95% CI - 0.58 to 0.03; p = 0.031).

In this work, a DNA-mediated immunosensor for the highly sensitive detection of prostate specific antigen (PSA) is proposed, which is mainly based on a portable personal glucose meter (PGM). Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) functionalized with PSA detection antibodies and DNA primers are introduced. When the target of the PSA is present, rolling circle amplification (RCA) reactions on AuNPs are triggered and numerous repeated RCA products hybridize with the DNA-conjugated invertase; thus the signal of the PGM is generated and the PSA is quantified indirectly. With the use of a portable PGM, our method realizes a linear detection range of 0.003-50 ng mL-1, with a low detection limit of 0.1 pg mL-1, which is comparable to that of the traditional methods using expensive apparatus. Besides, the analysis of clinical human serum samples is performed to investigate its good practicability. This simple, low-cost, and miniaturized immunosensor is promising for the point-of-care testing of cancer markers.""","""['Feifei Sun', 'Xiaomei Sun', 'Yijing Jia', 'Zhian Hu', 'Shenghao Xu', 'Lin Li', 'Na Na', 'Jin Ouyang']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Analyst""","""['Bio-bar-code-based photoelectrochemical immunoassay for sensitive detection of prostate-specific antigen using rolling circle amplification and enzymatic biocatalytic precipitation.', 'An ultrasensitive sandwich-type electrochemical immunosensor based on the signal amplification strategy of echinoidea-shaped Au@Ag-Cu2O nanoparticles for prostate specific antigen detection.', 'Ultrasensitive electrochemical immunosensor for PSA biomarker detection in prostate cancer cells using gold nanoparticles/PAMAM dendrimer loaded with enzyme linked aptamer as integrated triple signal amplification strategy.', 'An ultrasensitive detection of 17β-estradiol using a gold nanoparticle-based fluorescence immunoassay.', 'Recent progress in prostate-specific antigen and HIV proteases detection.', 'Personal glucose meters coupled with signal amplification technologies for quantitative detection of non-glucose targets: Recent progress and challenges in food safety hazards analysis.', 'Technologies for Frugal and Sensitive Point-of-Care Immunoassays.', 'Rolling Circle Amplification as a Universal Method for the Analysis of a Wide Range of Biological Targets.']"""

Here, we explore the clinical usefulness of this classification by testing the classifier's performance in a multifocal context. We analyzed 106 cancer samples from 85 distinct cancer foci within 39 patients. By somatic mutation data from whole-exome sequencing and targeted qualitative and quantitative gene expression assays, 31% of the patients were uniquely classified into one of the seven TCGA classes.

Importantly, a global genetic network mapped for a model eukaryotic organism revealed that genetic interactions often connect genes between compensatory functional modules in a highly coherent manner. Taking advantage of this expected structure, we developed a computational approach called BridGE that identifies pathways connected by genetic interactions from GWAS data.

We investigated institutional variations in PSM after RP, as well as clinical and demographic factors predicting PSM.  Patients and methods:   Patients undergoing RP for clinically localized CaP were identified in the National Cancer Database in 2010 to 2013 and clinicodemographics were recorded. Treating institution was defined as academic (AMC) or nonacademic medical centers (nAMC). The primary outcome was the PSM rate. Multivariable logistic regression and propensity matching with inverse probability treatment weighing were used to both compare outcomes between AMC and nAMC and to identify predictors of PSM following RP.  Results:   A total of 167,260 patients met our inclusion criteria. PSM rate was significantly lower in patients treated at AMC (13,435, 18.9%) compared with 22,145 (23.0%) in those treated at nAMC (P < 0.01). The difference between PSM rate in AMC and nAMC was more pronounced in lower volume centers while it was not significant in higher volume centers. On multivariable analysis, age, race, prostate-specific antigen (PSA), biopsy Gleason score, comorbidity profile, insurance type, income, and treatment facility were significantly associated with PSM rate.  Conclusion:   PSM rates appear to be lower at AMC and higher volume facilities, which can potentially reflect institutional differences in surgical quality. In addition, we identified several socioeconomic and demographic factors that contribute to the likelihood of PSM following RP for localized CaP, suggesting potential systematic variation in the quality of surgical care. The cause of this variation warrants further investigation and evaluation.""","""['Aydin Pooli', 'Amirali Salmasi', 'David C Johnson', 'Andrew T Lenis', 'Izak Faiena', 'Cedric Lebacle', 'Vishnukamal Golla', 'Alexandra Drakaki', 'Kiran Gollapudi', 'Jeremy Blumberg', 'Allan J Pantuck', 'Karim Chamie']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Urol Oncol""","""['A multinational, multi-institutional study comparing positive surgical margin rates among 22393 open, laparoscopic, and robot-assisted radical prostatectomy patients.', 'Impact of positive surgical margins on prostate-specific antigen failure after radical prostatectomy in adjuvant treatment-naïve patients.', 'Variation in Positive Surgical Margin Status After Radical Prostatectomy for pT2 Prostate Cancer.', 'Radical prostatectomy: positive surgical margins matter.', 'The length of a positive surgical margin is of prognostic significance in patients with clinically localized prostate cancer treated with radical prostatectomy.', 'Positive association between preoperative lymphocyte-to-monocyte ratio and risk of the status of positive surgical margins by prostate cancer: results in 497 consecutive patients treated only by radical prostatectomy.']"""

Symptoms of late radiation cystitis can be assessed with the Expanded Prostate Index Composite Score (EPIC). Previous reports indicate that hyperbaric oxygen therapy reduces symptoms from late radiation cystitis, but the evidence is predominantly based on non-randomised and retrospective studies. We aimed to assess whether hyperbaric oxygen therapy would mitigate symptoms of late radiation cystitis.  Methods:   We did a randomised, controlled, phase 2-3 trial (RICH-ART [Radiation Induced Cystitis treated with Hyperbaric oxygen-A Randomised controlled Trial]) at five Nordic university hospitals. All patients aged 18-80 years, with pelvic radiotherapy completed at least 6 months previously, a score of less than 80 in the urinary domain of the Expanded Prostate Index Composite Score (EPIC), and referred to participating hyperbaric clinics due to symptoms of late radiation cystitis, were eligible for inclusion. Exclusion criteria were ongoing bleeding requiring blood transfusion exceeding 500 mL in the past 4 weeks, permanent urinary catheter, bladder capacity less than 100 mL, fistula in the urinary bladder, previous treatment with hyperbaric oxygen therapy for late radiation injuries, and contraindications to hyperbaric oxygen therapy. After computer-generated 1:1 randomisation with block sizes of four for each stratification group (sex, time from radiotherapy to inclusion, and previous invasive surgery in the pelvic area), patients received hyperbaric oxygen therapy (30-40 sessions, 100% oxygen, breathed at a pressure of 240-250 kPa, for 80-90 min daily) or standard care with no restrictions for other medications or interventions. No masking was applied. The primary outcome was change in patient-perceived urinary symptoms assessed with EPIC from inclusion to follow-up at visit 4 (6-8 months later), measured as absolute change in EPIC urinary total score. RICH-ART closed enrolment on Dec 31, 2017; the last follow-up data will be compiled in 2023. RICH-ART is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01659723, and with the European Medicines Agency, number EudraCT 2012-001381-15.  Findings:   Of 223 patients screened between May 9, 2012, and Dec 20, 2017, 87 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to either hyperbaric oxygen therapy (n=42) or standard care (n=45). After excluding eight patients who withdrew consent directly after randomisation (one in the hyperbaric oxygen therapy group and seven in the standard care group), 79 were included in the intention-to-treat analyses (n=41 in the hyperbaric oxygen therapy group, n=38 in the standard care group). Median time from randomisation to visit 4 was 234 days (IQR 210-262) in the hyperbaric oxygen therapy group and 217 days (195-237) in the standard care group. The difference between change in group mean of EPIC urinary total score at visit 4 was 10·1 points (95% CI 2·2-18·1; p=0·013; 17·8 points [SD 18·4] in the hyperbaric oxygen therapy group vs 7·7 points [15·5] in the standard care group). 17 (41%) of 41 patients in the hyperbaric oxygen therapy group experienced transient grade 1-2 adverse events, related to sight and hearing, during the period of hyperbaric oxygen therapy.  Interpretation:   Our results suggest that hyperbaric oxygen therapy relieves symptoms of late radiation cystitis. We conclude that hyperbaric oxygen therapy is a safe and well tolerated treatment.

The IMPACT study is evaluating targeted PrCa screening using prostate-specific-antigen (PSA) in men with germline BRCA1/2 mutations.  Objective:   To report the utility of PSA screening, PrCa incidence, positive predictive value of PSA, biopsy, and tumour characteristics after 3 yr of screening, by BRCA status.  Design, setting, and participants:   Men aged 40-69 yr with a germline pathogenic BRCA1/2 mutation and male controls testing negative for a familial BRCA1/2 mutation were recruited. Participants underwent PSA screening for 3 yr, and if PSA > 3.0 ng/ml, men were offered prostate biopsy.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   PSA levels, PrCa incidence, and tumour characteristics were evaluated. Statistical analyses included Poisson regression offset by person-year follow-up, chi-square tests for proportion t tests for means, and Kruskal-Wallis for medians.  Results and limitations:   A total of 3027 patients (2932 unique individuals) were recruited (919 BRCA1 carriers, 709 BRCA1 noncarriers, 902 BRCA2 carriers, and 497 BRCA2 noncarriers). After 3 yr of screening, 527 men had PSA > 3.0 ng/ml, 357 biopsies were performed, and 112 PrCa cases were diagnosed (31 BRCA1 carriers, 19 BRCA1 noncarriers, 47 BRCA2 carriers, and 15 BRCA2 noncarriers). Higher compliance with biopsy was observed in BRCA2 carriers compared with noncarriers (73% vs 60%). Cancer incidence rate per 1000 person years was higher in BRCA2 carriers than in noncarriers (19.4 vs 12.0; p = 0.03); BRCA2 carriers were diagnosed at a younger age (61 vs 64 yr; p = 0.04) and were more likely to have clinically significant disease than BRCA2 noncarriers (77% vs 40%; p = 0.01). No differences in age or tumour characteristics were detected between BRCA1 carriers and BRCA1 noncarriers. The 4 kallikrein marker model discriminated better (area under the curve [AUC] = 0.73) for clinically significant cancer at biopsy than PSA alone (AUC = 0.65).  Conclusions:   After 3 yr of screening, compared with noncarriers, BRCA2 mutation carriers were associated with a higher incidence of PrCa, younger age of diagnosis, and clinically significant tumours. Therefore, systematic PSA screening is indicated for men with a BRCA2 mutation. Further follow-up is required to assess the role of screening in BRCA1 mutation carriers.  Patient summary:   We demonstrate that after 3 yr of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing, we detect more serious prostate cancers in men with BRCA2 mutations than in those without these mutations. We recommend that male BRCA2 carriers are offered systematic PSA screening.""","""['Elizabeth C Page', 'Elizabeth K Bancroft', 'Mark N Brook', 'Melissa Assel', 'Mona Hassan Al Battat', 'Sarah Thomas', 'Natalie Taylor', 'Anthony Chamberlain', 'Jennifer Pope', 'Holly Ni Raghallaigh', 'D Gareth Evans', 'Jeanette Rothwell', 'Lovise Maehle', 'Eli Marie Grindedal', 'Paul James', 'Lyon Mascarenhas', 'Joanne McKinley', 'Lucy Side', 'Tessy Thomas', 'Christi van Asperen', 'Hans Vasen', 'Lambertus A Kiemeney', 'Janneke Ringelberg', 'Thomas Dyrsø Jensen', 'Palle J S Osther', 'Brian T Helfand', 'Elena Genova', 'Rogier A Oldenburg', 'Cezary Cybulski', 'Dominika Wokolorczyk', 'Kai-Ren Ong', 'Camilla Huber', 'Jimmy Lam', 'Louise Taylor', 'Monica Salinas', 'Lidia Feliubadaló', 'Jan C Oosterwijk', 'Wendy van Zelst-Stams', 'Jackie Cook', 'Derek J Rosario', 'Susan Domchek', 'Jacquelyn Powers', 'Saundra Buys', ""Karen O'Toole"", 'Margreet G E M Ausems', 'Rita K Schmutzler', 'Kerstin Rhiem', 'Louise Izatt', 'Vishakha Tripathi', 'Manuel R Teixeira', 'Marta Cardoso', 'William D Foulkes', 'Armen Aprikian', 'Heleen van Randeraad', 'Rosemarie Davidson', 'Mark Longmuir', 'Mariëlle W G Ruijs', 'Apollonia T J M Helderman van den Enden', 'Muriel Adank', 'Rachel Williams', 'Lesley Andrews', 'Declan G Murphy', 'Dorothy Halliday', 'Lisa Walker', 'Annelie Liljegren', 'Stefan Carlsson', 'Ashraf Azzabi', 'Irene Jobson', 'Catherine Morton', 'Kylie Shackleton', 'Katie Snape', 'Helen Hanson', 'Marion Harris', 'Marc Tischkowitz', 'Amy Taylor', 'Judy Kirk', 'Rachel Susman', 'Rakefet Chen-Shtoyerman', 'Allan Spigelman', 'Nicholas Pachter', 'Munaza Ahmed', 'Teresa Ramon Y Cajal', 'Janez Zgajnar', 'Carole Brewer', 'Neus Gadea', 'Angela F Brady', 'Theo van Os', 'David Gallagher', 'Oskar Johannsson', 'Alan Donaldson', 'Julian Barwell', 'Nicola Nicolai', 'Eitan Friedman', 'Elias Obeid', 'Lynn Greenhalgh', 'Vedang Murthy', 'Lucia Copakova', 'Sibel Saya', 'John McGrath', 'Peter Cooke', 'Karina Rønlund', 'Kate Richardson', 'Alex Henderson', 'Soo H Teo', 'Banu Arun', 'Karin Kast', 'Alexander Dias', 'Neil K Aaronson', 'Audrey Ardern-Jones', 'Chris H Bangma', 'Elena Castro', 'David Dearnaley', 'Diana M Eccles', 'Karen Tricker', 'Jorunn Eyfjord', 'Alison Falconer', 'Christopher Foster', 'Henrik Gronberg', 'Freddie C Hamdy', 'Vigdis Stefansdottir', 'Vincent Khoo', 'Geoffrey J Lindeman', 'Jan Lubinski', 'Karol Axcrona', 'Christos Mikropoulos', 'Anita Mitra', 'Clare Moynihan', 'Gadi Rennert', 'Mohnish Suri', 'Penny Wilson', 'Tim Dudderidge;IMPACT Study Collaborators;Judith Offman', 'Zsofia Kote-Jarai', 'Andrew Vickers', 'Hans Lilja', 'Rosalind A Eeles']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Eur Urol""","""['The IMPACT of BRCA2 in prostate cancer.', 'Targeted prostate cancer screening in BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers: results from the initial screening round of the IMPACT study.', 'A prospective prostate cancer screening programme for men with pathogenic variants in mismatch repair genes (IMPACT): initial results from an international prospective study.', 'Targeted prostate cancer screening in men with mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 detects aggressive prostate cancer: preliminary analysis of the results of the IMPACT study.', 'Prostate cancer screening in BRCA and Lynch syndrome mutation carriers.', 'Prostate cancer risk, screening and management in patients with germline BRCA1/2 mutations.', 'DNA Damage Repair Pathways in Prostate Cancer: A Narrative Review of Molecular Mechanisms, Emerging Biomarkers and Therapeutic Targets in Precision Oncology.', 'Impact of DNA damage repair alterations on prostate cancer progression and metastasis.', 'Guidelines for genetic testing in prostate cancer: a scoping review.', 'Roles of the PARP Inhibitor in BRCA1 and BRCA2 Pathogenic Mutated Metastatic Prostate Cancer: Direct Functions and Modification of the Tumor Microenvironment.', 'Clinical risk management of breast, ovarian, pancreatic, and prostatic cancers for BRCA1/2 variant carriers in Japan.']"""

Intracrine pathways that utilize dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) or other circulatory precursor steroids, are thought to generate relevant levels of growth-stimulating androgens such as testosterone (T) and dihydrotestosterone (DHT). In this study, we explored the capacity of the active vitamin D hormone to interact and elicit changes upon this prostatic intracrine pathway at a metabolic level. We used androgen dependent LNCaP cells cultured under steroid-depleted conditions and assessed the impact of vitamin D-based compounds upon intracrine pathways that convert exogenously added DHEA to relevant metabolites, through Mass Spectrometry (MS). Changes in relevant metabolism-related gene targets were also assessed.

To inform health system responses to these changing patterns of disease, we aimed to assess changes in the burden of NCDs in sub-Saharan Africa from 1990 to 2017.  Methods:   We used data from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2017 to analyse the burden of NCDs in sub-Saharan Africa in terms of disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs)-with crude counts as well as all-age and age-standardised rates per 100 000 population-with 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs). We examined changes in burden between 1990 and 2017, and differences across age, sex, and regions. We also compared the observed NCD burden across countries with the expected values based on a country's Socio-demographic Index.  Findings:   All-age total DALYs due to NCDs increased by 67·0% between 1990 (90·6 million [95% UI 81·0-101·9]) and 2017 (151·3 million [133·4-171·8]), reflecting an increase in the proportion of total DALYs attributable to NCDs (from 18·6% [95% UI 17·1-20·4] to 29·8% [27·6-32·0] of the total burden). Although most of this increase can be explained by population growth and ageing, the age-standardised DALY rate (per 100 000 population) due to NCDs in 2017 (21 757·7 DALYs [95% UI 19 377·1-24 380·7]) was almost equivalent to that of communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional diseases (26 491·6 DALYs [25 165·2-28 129·8]). Cardiovascular diseases were the second leading cause of NCD burden in 2017, resulting in 22·9 million (21·5-24·3) DALYs (15·1% of the total NCD burden), after the group of disorders categorised as other NCDs (28·8 million [25·1-33·0] DALYs, 19·1%). These categories were followed by neoplasms, mental disorders, and digestive diseases. Although crude DALY rates for all NCDs have decreased slightly across sub-Saharan Africa, age-standardised rates are on the rise in some countries (particularly those in southern sub-Saharan Africa) and for some NCDs (such as diabetes and some cancers, including breast and prostate cancer).  Interpretation:   NCDs in sub-Saharan Africa are posing an increasing challenge for health systems, which have to date largely focused on tackling infectious diseases and maternal, neonatal, and child deaths. To effectively address these changing needs, countries in sub-Saharan Africa require detailed epidemiological data on NCDs.

However, clinical benefits are limited to a median time of 4.8 months because resistance inevitably emerges. To determine the mechanism of treatment resistance, we carried out a RNA sequence analysis and found increased expression levels of neuroendocrine markers in the enzalutamide-resistant LNCaP human prostate cancer (CaP) cell line when compared to the parental cell line. Subsequent studies demonstrated that Transcription Factor-4 (TCF4), a transcription factor implicated in WNT signaling, mediated neuroendocrine differentiation (NED) in response to enzalutamide treatment and was elevated in the enzalutamide-resistant LNCaP. In addition, we observed that PTHrP mediated enzalutamide resistance in tissue culture and inducible TCF4 overexpression resulted in enzalutamide-resistance in a mouse xenograft model. Finally, small molecule inhibitors of TCF4 or PTHrP partially reversed enzalutamide resistance in CaP cells. When tissues obtained from men who died of metastatic CaP were examined, a positive correlation was found between the expression levels of TCF4 and PTHrP.

Moreover, the presence of particles in blood with a similar size as that of tdEVs makes their selective and sensitive detection further challenging. Therefore, highly sensitive and specific biosensors are required for unambiguous tdEV detection in complex biological environments, especially for decentralized point-of-care analysis. Here, we report an electrochemical sensing scheme for tdEV detection, with two-level selectivity provided by a sandwich immunoassay and two-level amplification through the combination of an enzymatic assay and redox cycling on nanointerdigitated electrodes to respectively enhance the specificity and sensitivity of the assay. Analysis of prostate cancer cell line tdEV samples at various concentrations revealed an estimated limit of detection for our assay as low as 5 tdEVs/μL, as well as an excellent linear sensor response spreading over 6 orders of magnitude (10-106 tdEVs/μL), which importantly covers the clinically relevant range for tdEV detection in blood.

Aim:   to evaluate the influence of PD-L1 expression status in tumor cells on long-term results of radical treatment in patients with PCa.  Materials and methods:   a total of 45 patients with pathologically-proven PCa who undergone radical treatment and followed at N.N. Blokhin National Medical Research Center of Oncology were retrospectively analyzed. In all cases PD-L1 expression in tumor cells was evaluated by immunohistochemical studies of paraffin block sections obtained under direct control of pathologist. Positive expression of PD-L1(+) was defined as expression level in tumor cells more or equal 1%, while hyperexpression was diagnosed when expression level L1 more or equal 5%.  Results:   PD-L1 expression and hyperexpression in tumor cells were identified in 8 (17.8%) and 6 (13.3%) cases. Median metastasis-free survival in patients with positive PD-L1 expression was 48.918 months (95% CI 42.523-55.313) and was less than in patients with negative PD-L1 expression (68.033 months, 95% CI 48.242- 87.824, p=0.090). Cancer-specific survival in patients with negative PD-L1 expression was significantly longer compared to patients with positive expression (p=0.05) and hyperexpression (p=0.024) of PD-L1 in tumor cells. Multivariate Cox analysis confirmed independent predictive value of positive expression and hyperexpression of PD-L1 in tumor cells for metastasis-free survival (HR 3.461, 95% CI 1.171-10.228, p=0.025, and HR 3.916, 95% CI 1.129-13.591, p=0.032) and cancer-specific survival (HR 7.65, 95% CI 0.69-84.51, p=0.097, and HR 9.73, 95% CI 0.87-108.78, p=0.065).  Conclusion:   According to our study and published data, positive PD-L1 expression in tumor cells is associated with poor prognosis of PCa. Given the lack of association of PD-L1 expression in tumor cells with the routine clinical and pathological characteristics of the disease, it seems reasonable to include the status of PD-L1 expression in the current predictive nomograms for patients with PCa.

We examined the individual and synergistic effects of these modifiable lifestyle factors on overall and site-specific cancer risk.  Methods:   Baseline participant data were acquired from Alberta's Tomorrow Project (ATP). Adults 35-69 years old who consented to data linkage and completed relevant questionnaires were included (n = 26,607). Incident cases of cancer up to December 2017 were identified via linkage to the Alberta Cancer Registry. Associations between alcohol consumption, cigarette smoking, and cancer risk were examined using adjusted Cox proportional hazard models. Non-linear effects were estimated using restricted cubic splines. Interactions between alcohol and tobacco were examined through stratified analyses and inclusion of interaction terms in relevant models.  Results:   A total of 2,370 participants developed cancer during the study follow-up period. Cox proportional hazard models found no statistically significant associations between alcohol consumption and incidence of all cancers among males (hazard ratio [HR] 1.14, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.93-1.40) and females ([HR] 0.89, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.73-1.10), though a modest and positive association was observed in both males and the entire cohort using cubic splines. Smokers were at an increased risk of developing all cancers (female current smokers: [HR] 1.72, 95% [CI] 1.49-1.99, male current smokers: [HR] 1.24, 95% [CI] 1.03-1.49) with the strongest association observed between current smokers and lung cancer (males: [HR] 11.33, 95% [CI] 4.70-27.30, females: [HR] 23.51, 95% [CI] 12.70-43.60). A 3-way interaction model showed an additive effect between alcohol as a continuous variable (g/day) and pack-years (PYs) consumed for all, colon, and prostate cancers. A ""U-shaped"" multiplicative interaction was observed for breast cancer (p = 0.05).  Conclusions:   Alcohol consumption was minimally associated with all-cancer risk. Cigarette smoking clearly increased all-cancer risk, with females being more affected than males. Combined use of alcohol and tobacco increased the risk of developing all, colon, and prostate cancers.

Our research focused on development of serum markers for the diagnosis of PCa in patients with elevated PSA. miRNAs are found to be aberrantly expressed in many types of cancer. They are readily detectable in plasma and serum. Currently, miRNAs are being evaluated as potential prognostic and diagnostic tools for many types of cancer. We first profiled global serum miRNAs in a pilot set of PCa and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) cases undergoing TRUS-guided prostate biopsy due to elevated PSA levels. A total of 20 differentially expressed miRNAs were discovered by high throughput microarray for further testing using qRT-PCR. In the training phase with 78 PCa and 77 BPH cases, miR-365a-3p, miR-4286, miR-424-5p, miR-27a-3p, and miR-29b-3p were found to have potential diagnostic value. The Logistics regression equation was established by 5 parameters including PSA, prostate volume, miR-4286, miR-27a-3p, and miR-29b-3p and ROC analysis of this model was made with AUC up to 0.892 (95% CI: 0.832-0.937, sensitivity 78.95%, and specificity 92.21%). The panel had excellent diagnostic performance and its significance was confirmed in 100 serum samples in the validation cohort.

These molecular scaffolds inspired the development of many structurally modified derivatives and analogues as promising anticancer agents. A productive design blueprint that involved molecular hybridization of the pharmacophore moieties of combretastatin A-4 (CA4) and the chalcones led to the discovery of two promising lead molecules referred to as KGP413 and SD400. The corresponding water-soluble phosphate prodrug salts of KGP413 and SD400 selectively damaged tumor-associated vasculature, thus highlighting the potential development of these molecules as vascular disrupting agents (VDAs). These previous studies prompted our current investigation of conformationally restricted chalcones. Herein, we report the synthesis of cyclic chalcones and related analogues that incorporate structural motifs of CA4, and evaluation of their cytotoxicity against human cancer cell lines [NCI-H460 (lung), DU-145 (prostate), and SK-OV-3 (ovarian)]. While these molecules proved inactive as inhibitors of tubulin polymerization (IC50 > 20 μM), eight molecules demonstrated good antiproliferative activity (GI50 < 20 μM) against all three cancer cell lines, and compounds 2j and 2l demonstrated sub-micromolar cytotoxicity.

The aim of this study was to elucidate the role and the underlying mechanism of the double-negative feedback loop between ZEB1and miR-33a-5p in bone metastasis of prostate cancer (PCa). Methods: miR-33a-5p expression was examined in 40 bone metastatic and 165 non-bone metastatic PCa tissues by real-time PCR. Statistical analysis was performed to evaluate the clinical correlation between miR-33a-5p expression and clinicopathological characteristics, and overall and bone metastasis-free survival in PCa patients. The biological roles of miR-33a-5p in bone metastasis of PCa were investigated both by EMT and the Transwell assay in vitro, and by a mouse model of left cardiac ventricle inoculation in vivo. siRNA library, real-time PCR and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) were used to identify the underlying mechanism responsible for the decreased expression of miR-33a-5p in PCa. Bioinformatics analysis, Western blotting and luciferase reporter analysis were employed to examine the relationship between miR-33a-5p and its potential targets. Clinical correlation of miR-33a-5p with its targets was examined in human PCa tissues and primary PCa cells. Results: miR-33a-5p expression was downregulated in PCa tissues with bone metastasis and bone-derived cells, and low expression of miR-33a-5p strongly and positively correlated with advanced clinicopathological characteristics, and shorter overall and bone metastasis-free survival in PCa patients. Upregulating miR-33a-5p inhibited, while silencing miR-33a-5p promoted EMT, invasion and migration of PCa cells. Importantly, upregulating miR-33a-5p significantly repressed bone metastasis of PC-3 cells in vivo. Our results further revealed that recurrent ZEB1 upregulation induced by copy number gains transcriptionally inhibited miR-33a-5p expression, contributing to the reduced expression of miR-33a-5p in bone metastatic PCa tissues. In turn, miR-33a-5p formed a double negative feedback loop with ZEB1 in target-independent manner, which was dependent on TGF-β signaling. Finally, the clinical negative correlations of miR-33a-5p with ZEB1 expression and TGF-β signaling activity were demonstrated in PCa tissues and primary PCa cells. Conclusion: Our findings elucidated that copy number gains of ZEB1-triggered a TGF-β signaling-dependent miR-33a-5p-mediated negative feedback loop was highly relevant to the bone metastasis of PCa.""","""['Yuhu Dai', 'Zhengquan Wu', 'Chuandong Lang', 'Xin Zhang', 'Shaofu He', 'Qing Yang', 'Wei Guo', 'Yingrong Lai', 'Hong Du', 'Xinsheng Peng', 'Dong Ren']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Theranostics""","""['Oncogenic miR-210-3p promotes prostate cancer cell EMT and bone metastasis via NF-κB signaling pathway.', 'UBE2C, Directly Targeted by miR-548e-5p, Increases the Cellular Growth and Invasive Abilities of Cancer Cells Interacting with the EMT Marker Protein Zinc Finger E-box Binding Homeobox 1/2 in NSCLC.', 'LncRNA ADPGK-AS1 promotes pancreatic cancer progression through activating ZEB1-mediated epithelial-mesenchymal transition.', 'miR-200c: a versatile watchdog in cancer progression, EMT, and drug resistance.', 'Role of ZEB Family Members in Proliferation, Metastasis, and Chemoresistance of Prostate Cancer Cells: Revealing Signaling Networks.', 'FOXA1-induced LINC00621 promotes lung adenocarcinoma progression via activating the TGF-β signaling pathway.', 'The epithelial-mesenchymal plasticity landscape: principles of design and mechanisms of regulation.', 'Heterogeneity and plasticity of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in cancer metastasis: Focusing on partial EMT and regulatory mechanisms.', 'Long non-coding RNA MFSD4A-AS1 promotes lymphangiogenesis and lymphatic metastasis of papillary thyroid cancer.', 'The molecular mechanisms and therapeutic strategies of EMT in tumor progression and metastasis.']"""

However, it is not known whether downregulation of KLF5 is associated with the response of prostate cancer cells to chemotherapy and/or prognosis of patients. Methods: We monitored cell growth by MTT and colony formation assays, and cell autophagy through tandem fluorescence microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. Gene expression was analyzed by RT-qPCR and Western blotting. We determined the binding of KLF5 together with HDAC3 on the beclin-1 (BECN1) promoter by the ChIP assay, oligonucleotides pulldown, and co-immunoprecipitation. The effect of docetaxel on cell growth in vivo was examined in a CWR22RV1 xenograft tumor mouse model. Results: In the present study, we found that KLF5 down-regulation was associated with progression of prostate cancer and poor prognosis of patients. KLF5 knockdown reduced the sensitivity of prostate cancer cells to docetaxel in vitro and in vivo, and docetaxel treatment decreased the expression of KLF5. Moreover, we confirmed that docetaxel treatment inhibited cell death by inducing autophagy in prostate cancer cells. Thus, we hypothesized that KLF5 could be a regulator of cell autophagy. Interestingly, KLF5 could inhibit prostate cancer cell autophagy by suppressing the transcription of BECN1 cooperatively with HDAC3. Another significant finding was that docetaxel treatment repressed KLF5 expression through AMPK/mTOR/p70S6K signaling pathway resulting in increased BECN1, induction of cell autophagy, and promotion of cell survival in castration-resistant prostate cancer cells. Conclusions: Our results indicated that downregulation of KLF5 promoted cell autophagy in prostate cancer. Furthermore, reduced KLF5 also facilitated cell autophagy induced by docetaxel resulting in desensitization to the drug and cell survival. Decreased levels of KLF5 led to increased BECN1 via AMPK/mTOR/p70S6K signaling. Thus, repression of BECN1 and cell autophagy was critical for KLF5 to increase the sensitivity of prostate cancer cells to docetaxel.""","""['Jing Jia', 'Hai-Bao Zhang', 'Qi Shi', 'Chao Yang', 'Jian-Bin Ma', 'Bin Jin', 'Xinyang Wang', 'Dalin He', 'Peng Guo']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Theranostics""","""['Erratum: KLF5 downregulation desensitizes castration-resistant prostate cancer cells to docetaxel by increasing BECN1 expression and inducing cell autophagy: Erratum.', 'FOXM1 contributes to docetaxel resistance in castration-resistant prostate cancer by inducing AMPK/mTOR-mediated autophagy.', 'TGF-β causes Docetaxel resistance in Prostate Cancer via the induction of Bcl-2 by acetylated KLF5 and Protein Stabilization.', 'KLF2 (kruppel-like factor 2 lung) regulates osteoclastogenesis by modulating autophagy.', 'NPRL2 promotes docetaxel chemoresistance in castration resistant prostate cancer cells by regulating autophagy through the mTOR pathway.', 'The circROBO1/KLF5/FUS feedback loop regulates the liver metastasis of breast cancer by inhibiting the selective autophagy of afadin.', 'Interactions between circRNAs and miR-141 in Cancer: From Pathogenesis to Diagnosis and Therapy.', 'KLF6 alleviates hepatic ischemia-reperfusion injury by inhibiting autophagy.', 'JMJD2A participates in cytoskeletal remodeling to regulate castration-resistant prostate cancer docetaxel resistance.', 'New insights into KLFs and SOXs in cancer pathogenesis, stemness, and therapy.', 'Kruppel-like factor 2 contributes to blood-spinal cord barrier integrity and functional recovery from spinal cord injury by augmenting autophagic flux.']"""

In this study, we show that glomerular mTOR and PEC activation-related genes were both upregulated and intercorrelated in biopsies from patients with focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) and diabetic nephropathy, suggesting both compensatory and pathological roles. Advanced morphometric analyses in murine and human tissues identified podocyte hypertrophy as a compensatory mechanism aiming to regulate glomerular functional integrity in response to somatic growth, podocyte depletion, and even glomerulosclerosis - all of this in the absence of detectable podocyte regeneration. In mice, pharmacological inhibition of mTOR signaling during acute podocyte loss impaired hypertrophy of remaining podocytes, resulting in unexpected albuminuria, PEC activation, and glomerulosclerosis. Exacerbated and persistent podocyte hypertrophy enabled a vicious cycle of podocyte loss and PEC activation, suggesting a limit to its beneficial effects.

Gene Ontology (GO) term enrichment analysis and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis were also applied for the identification of pathways in which DNA methylation-driven genes significantly enriched. The protein-protein interaction (PPI) network and module analysis in Cytoscape software were used to find the hub genes. Two methylation profile (GSE112047 and GSE76938) datasets were utilized to validate screened hub genes. Immunohistochemistry of these hub genes were evaluated by the Human Protein Atlas.  Results:   A total of 553 samples in TCGA database, 32 samples in GSE112047 and 136 samples in GSE76938 were included in this study. There were a total of 266 differentially methylated genes were identified by MethylMix. Plus, a total of 369 differentially methylated genes and 594 differentially methylated genes were identified by the R package limma in GSE112047 and GSE76938, respectively. GO term enrichment analysis suggested that DNA methylation-driven genes significantly enriched in oxidation-reduction process, extracellular exosome, electron carrier activity, response to reactive oxygen species, and aldehyde dehydrogenase [NAD(P)+] activity. KEGG pathway analysis found DNA methylation-driven genes significantly enriched in five pathways including drug metabolism-cytochrome P450, phenylalanine metabolism, histidine metabolism, glutathione metabolism, and tyrosine metabolism. The validated hub genes were MAOB and RTP4.  Conclusions:   Methylated hub genes, including MAOB and RTP4, can be regarded as novel biomarkers for accurate PCa diagnosis and treatment. Further studies are needed to draw more attention to the roles of these hub genes in the occurrence and development of PCa.""","""['Ning Xu', 'Yu-Peng Wu', 'Zhi-Bin Ke', 'Ying-Chun Liang', 'Hai Cai', 'Wen-Ting Su', 'Xuan Tao', 'Shao-Hao Chen', 'Qing-Shui Zheng', 'Yong Wei', 'Xue-Yi Xue']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""J Transl Med""","""['Identification of key genes and pathways in castrate-resistant prostate cancer by integrated bioinformatics analysis.', 'Identification of Core Genes and Key Pathways via Integrated Analysis of Gene Expression and DNA Methylation Profiles in Bladder Cancer.', 'Identification of aberrantly methylated differentially expressed genes in prostate carcinoma using integrated bioinformatics.', 'Prognostic DNA methylation markers for prostate cancer.', 'Promoter hypermethylation in prostate cancer.', 'Multi-Omics Data Analysis Identifies Prognostic Biomarkers across Cancers.', 'DNA methylation biomarkers distinguishing early-stage prostate cancer from benign prostatic hyperplasia.', 'The diagnostic significance of the ZNF gene family in pancreatic cancer: a bioinformatics and experimental study.', 'RTP4, a Biomarker Associated with Diagnosing Pulmonary Tuberculosis and Pan-Cancer Analysis.', 'DNA-methylation and genomic copy number in primary tumors and corresponding lymph node metastases in prostate cancer from patients with low and high Gleason score.']"""

Methods:   The benchmark included dose profiles in water in 15 mm depth and depth dose curves of rectangular MLC shaped fields ranging from 7.6 mm × 7.7 mm to 115.0 mm × 100.1 mm, which were compared between IDC, Precision MC and measurements in terms of dose difference and distance to agreement. Dose distributions of three phantom cases and seven clinical lung cases were calculated using both IDC and Precision MC. The lung PTVs ranged from 14 cm3 to 93 cm3. Quantitative comparison of these dose distributions was performed using dose-volume parameters and 3D gamma analysis with 2% global dose difference and 1 mm distance criteria and a global 10% dose threshold. Time to calculate dose distributions was recorded and efficiency was assessed.  Results:   Absolute dose profiles in 15 mm depth in water showed agreement between Precision MC and IDC within 3.1% or 1 mm. Depth dose curves agreed within 2.3% / 1 mm. For the phantom and clinical lung cases, mean PTV doses differed from - 1.0 to + 2.3% between IDC and Precision MC and gamma passing rates were > =98.1% for all multiple beam treatment plans. For the lung cases, lung V20 agreed within ±1.5%. Calculation times ranged from 2.2 min (for 39 cm3 PTV at 1.0 × 1.0 × 2.5 mm3 native CT resolution) to 8.1 min (93 cm3 at 1.1 × 1.1 × 1.0 mm3), at 2% uncertainty for Precision MC for the 7 examined lung cases and 4-6 h for IDC, which, however, is not optimized for efficiency but used as a gold standard for accuracy.

Methods:   Between 1 January 2014 and 31 December 2017, the patients with primary lung cancer who received lobectomy or segmental resection via video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) in our department were screened. Based on whether a urinary catheter was inserted after surgery, patients were divided into urinary catheter (UC) group or non-UC group, and rates of postoperative urinary retention (POUR), urinary catheter re-insertion and urinary tract infection (UTI) were compared.  Results:   There was no difference in International prostate symptom score (p = .268) between the groups, but a higher Sedation-Agitation Scale (SAS) score was found in UC group [4.0 (3.0 4.0) vs. 4.0 (2.0, 4.0); p < .001], with a higher proportion of patients with agitation (SAS score > 4; 17.3%, 317/1,835 vs. 12.9%, 86/660, p = .008).

Turmeric is rich in curcuminoids, including curcumin, demethoxycurcumin, and bisdemethoxycurcumin. Curcuminoids have potent wound healing, anti-inflammatory, and anti-carcinogenic activities. While curcuminoids have been studied for many years, not much is known about their effects on steroid metabolism. Since many anti-cancer drugs target enzymes from the steroidogenic pathway, we tested the effect of curcuminoids on cytochrome P450 CYP17A1, CYP21A2, and CYP19A1 enzyme activities. When using 10 µg/ml of curcuminoids, both the 17α-hydroxylase as well as 17,20 lyase activities of CYP17A1 were reduced significantly. On the other hand, only a mild reduction in CYP21A2 activity was observed. Furthermore, CYP19A1 activity was also reduced up to ~20% of control when using 1-100 µg/ml of curcuminoids in a dose-dependent manner. Molecular docking studies confirmed that curcumin could dock onto the active sites of CYP17A1, CYP19A1, as well as CYP21A2. In CYP17A1 and CYP19A1, curcumin docked within 2.5 Å of central heme while in CYP21A2 the distance from heme was 3.4 Å, which is still in the same range or lower than distances of bound steroid substrates. These studies suggest that curcuminoids may cause inhibition of steroid metabolism, especially at higher dosages. Also, the recent popularity of turmeric powder as a dilatory supplement needs further evaluation for the effect of curcuminoids on steroid metabolism. The molecular structure of curcuminoids could be modified to generate better lead compounds with inhibitory effects on CYP17A1 and CYP19A1 for potential drugs against prostate cancer and breast cancer.""","""['Patricia Rodríguez Castaño', 'Shaheena Parween', 'Amit V Pandey']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Int J Mol Sci""","""['Vasodilating, spasmolytic, inotropic and chronotropic activities of curcuminoids from Curcuma longa in isolated organ preparations of guinea pigs.', 'The Golden Spice for Life: Turmeric with the Pharmacological Benefits of Curcuminoids Components, including Curcumin, Bisdemethoxycurcumin, and Demethoxycurcumin.', 'Bioactivity of turmeric-derived curcuminoids and related metabolites in breast cancer.', 'Curcumin--from molecule to biological function.', ""Therapeutic potential of turmeric in Alzheimer's disease: curcumin or curcuminoids?"", 'Novel Insights into the Therapeutic Potential of Curcumin and Derivatives.', 'Non-steroidal CYP17A1 Inhibitors: Discovery and Assessment.', 'Adrenocortical Carcinoma (ACC) Cells Rewire Their Metabolism to Overcome Curcumin Antitumoral Effects Opening a Window of Opportunity to Improve Treatment.', 'Complementary medicines used in ulcerative colitis and unintended interactions with cytochrome P450-dependent drug-metabolizing enzymes.', 'Progesterone Induces Apoptosis and Steroidogenesis in Porcine Placental Trophoblasts.']"""

To better understand the correlation between BRCA1/2 mutations and the immune phenotype in prostate cancer, we characterized the immune infiltrate of eight BRCA2-mutated tumors in comparison with eight BRCA1/2 wild-type patients by T-cell receptor sequencing and immunohistochemistry for CD45, CD4, CD8, FOXP3, and CD163. In addition, we analyzed seven prostate cancer biopsies that were either BRCA2 or ATM-mutated in comparison with wild-type tumors. Whereas in BRCA1/2 wild-type tumors, immune cells were found predominantly extratumorally, most BRCA2-mutated tumors including one biopsy showed a significantly increased intratumoral immune cell infiltration. The ratio of intratumoral to extratumoral immune cells was considerably higher in BRCA2-mutated tumors for all markers and reached statistical significance for CD4 (p = 0.007), CD8 (p = 0.006), and FOXP3 (p = 0.001). However, the intratumoral CD8 to FOXP3 ratio showed a trend to be lower in BRCA2-mutated tumors suggesting a more suppressed tumor immune microenvironment.

The multiparametric data were compared between PCa and BPH group. Correlations between parameters and Gleason scores of PCa were assessed with Spearman rank test. ROC analysis was used to evaluate and compare the diagnostic ability of each parameter for discriminating PCa from BPH.

The Cp-complexes and the free ligands are prepared by straightforward functionalization with either one or two Lys-urea-Glu (LuG) PSMA binding motifs. Cell binding assays revealed that the difunctional rhenium complex displays a dissociation constant (KD = 2.1 nM) that is an order of magnitude lower than the monofunctional compound (KD = 24.2 nM). The 99mTc complexes can be prepared in one step and ≤15 min in high yields. These difunctional Cp-Re(i)/99mTc(i) complexes represent a new class of imaging agents with binding affinities comparable to clinically evaluated compounds.

We conducted a population-based study to assess the proportion of patients who underwent at between January 2011 and December 2014, and to evaluate factors associated with at.  Methods:   The provincial cancer registry was linked to administrative health datasets to identify patients with lr-pca and to acquire demographic, tumour, and treatment data. The primary outcome was receipt of at during the first 12 months after diagnosis, defined as any receipt of external-beam radiotherapy, brachytherapy, radical prostatectomy, cryotherapy, or androgen deprivation. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression were used to analyze the correlation between patient and tumour factors and at.  Results:   Of 1565 patients with lr-pca, 554 (35.4%) underwent at within 12 months of diagnosis. Radical prostatectomy was the most common treatment (58%), followed by brachytherapy (29.6%). Younger age [odds ratio (or) 0.92; 95% confidence interval (ci): 0.91 to 0.94], lower score (≥3) on the Charlson comorbidity index (OR: 0.36; 95% ci: 0.19 to 0.68), T2 stage (or: 3.05; 95% ci: 2.03 to 4.58), higher prostate-specific antigen (psa) at diagnosis (or: 1.13; 95% ci: 1.06 to 1.21), radiation oncologist consultation (or: 3.35; 95% ci: 2.55 to 4.39), and earlier diagnosis year (2012 or: 0.46; 95% ci: 0.34 to 0.63; 2013 or: 0.45; 95% ci: 0.32 to 0.63; 2014 or: 0.33; 95% ci: 0.23 to 0.47) were associated with a higher probability of at.  Conclusions:   This contemporary population-based study demonstrates that approximately one third of patients with lr-pca undergo at. Patients of younger age, with less comorbidity, a higher tumour stage, higher psa, earlier year of diagnosis, and radiation oncologist consultation were more likely to undergo at.

In the current study, we identified exosome-mediated transfer of pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) from PCa cells into bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) as a novel mechanism through which primary tumor-derived exosomes promote premetastatic niche formation. We found that PKM2 up-regulates BMSC CXCL12 production in a HIF-1α-dependent fashion, which subsequently enhances PCa seeding and growth in the bone marrow. Furthermore, serum-derived exosomes from patients with either primary PCa or PCa metastasis, as opposed to healthy men, reveal that increased exosome PKM2 expression is associated with metastasis, suggesting clinical relevance of exosome PKM2 in PCa. Targeting the exosome-induced CXCL12 axis diminished exosome-mediated bone metastasis. In summary, primary PCa cells educate the bone marrow to create a premetastatic niche through primary PCa exosome-mediated transfer of PKM2 into BMSCs and subsequent up-regulation of CXCL12.

Despite initial clinical activity, acquired resistance to enzalutamide arises rapidly and most patients develop terminal disease. Previous work has established Stat5 as a potent inducer of prostate cancer growth. Here, we investigated the significance of Jak2-Stat5 signaling in resistance of prostate cancer to enzalutamide. The levels of Jak2 and Stat5 mRNA, proteins and activation were evaluated in prostate cancer cells, xenograft tumors, and clinical prostate cancers before and after enzalutamide therapy. Jak2 and Stat5 were suppressed by genetic knockdown using lentiviral shRNA or pharmacologic inhibitors. Responsiveness of primary and enzalutamide-resistant prostate cancer to pharmacologic inhibitors of Jak2-Stat5 signaling was assessed in vivo in mice bearing prostate cancer xenograft tumors. Patient-derived prostate cancers were tested for responsiveness to Stat5 blockade as second-line treatment after enzalutamide ex vivo in tumor explant cultures. Enzalutamide-liganded AR induces sustained Jak2-Stat5 phosphorylation in prostate cancer leading to the formation of a positive feed-forward loop, where activated Stat5, in turn, induces Jak2 mRNA and protein levels contributing to further Jak2 activation. Mechanistically, enzalutamide-liganded AR induced Jak2 phosphorylation through a process involving Jak2-specific phosphatases. Stat5 promoted prostate cancer growth during enzalutamide treatment. Jak2-Stat5 inhibition induced death of prostate cancer cells and patient-derived prostate cancers surviving enzalutamide treatment and blocked enzalutamide-resistant tumor growth in mice.

However, consensus on the optimal definition of low clinical suspicion is lacking. We evaluated 266 biopsy-naïve patients who underwent mpMRI, the 4Kscore test, and prostate biopsy to define the best strategy to avoid unnecessary testing and biopsies. The European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer risk calculator (ERSPC-RC) and prostate-specific antigen density (PSAd) were also considered. For men with Prostate Imaging-Reporting and Data System v2.0 (PI-RADS) 1⿿2 lesions, the highest negative predictive value was observed for those with low or intermediate 4Kscore risk (96.9% and 97.1%), PSAd <0.10ng/ml/cm3 (98.7%), and ERSPC-RC <2% (98.7%). For men with PI-RADS 3⿿5 lesions the lowest positive predictive value was observed for those with low 4Kscore risk (0%), PSAd <0.10ng/ml/cm3 (13.2%), and ERSPC-RC <2% (12.3%). The best biopsy strategy was an initial 4Kscore followed by mpMRI if the 4Kscore was>7.5% and a subsequent biopsy if the mpMRI was positive (PI-RADS 3⿿5) or the 4Kscore was ⿥18%. This would result in missing 2.7% (2/74) of clinically significant PCs (csPCs) and avoiding 34.2% of biopsies. Initial mpMRI followed by biopsy for negative mpMRI (PI-RADS 1⿿2) if the 4Kscore was ⿥18% or PSAd was ⿥0.10ng/ml/cm3 resulted in a similar percentage of csPC missed (2.7% [2/74] and 1.3% [1/74]) but slightly fewer biopsies avoided (25.2% and 28.1%).

Objective:   To develop novel models to predict extracapsular extension (ECE), seminal vesicle invasion (SVI), or upgrading in patients diagnosed with MRI-targeted and concomitant systematic biopsies.  Design, setting, and participants:   We included 614 men with clinical stage≤T2 at digital rectal examination who underwent MRI-targeted biopsy with concomitant systematic biopsy.  Outcome measurements and statistical analyses:   Logistic regression analyses predicting ECE, SVI, and upgrading (ie, a shift from biopsy International Society of Urological Pathology grade group to any higher grade at RP) based on clinical variables with or without mp-MRI features and systematic biopsy information (the percentage of cores with grade group ≥2 PCa) were developed and internally validated. The area under the curve (AUC) was used to identify the models with the highest discrimination. Decision-curve analyses (DCAs) determined the net benefit associated with their use.  Results and limitations:   Overall, 333 (54%), 88 (14%), and 169 (27%) patients had ECE, SVI, and upgrading at RP, respectively. The inclusion of mp-MRI data improved the discrimination of clinical models for ECE (67% vs 70%) and SVI (74% vs 76%). Models including mp-MRI, and MRI-targeted and concomitant systematic biopsy information achieved the highest AUC at internal validation for ECE (73%), SVI (81%), and upgrading (73%) and represented the basis for three risk calculators that yield the highest net benefit at DCA.  Conclusions:   Not only mp-MRI and MRI-targeted sampling, but also concomitant systematic biopsies provide significant information to identify patients at a higher risk of adverse pathology. Although omitting systematic prostate sampling at the time of MRI-targeted biopsy might be associated with a reduced risk of detecting insignificant PCa and lower patient discomfort, it reduces the ability to accurately predict pathological features.  Patient summary:   The combination of multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mp-MRI) with accurate biopsy information on MRI-targeted and systematic biopsies improves the accuracy of multivariable models based on clinical and mp-MRI data alone. Correct mp-MRI interpretation and proper extensive prostate sampling are both needed to predict adverse pathology accurately at radical prostatectomy.""","""['Giorgio Gandaglia', 'Guillaume Ploussard', 'Massimo Valerio', 'Agostino Mattei', 'Cristian Fiori', 'Mathieu Roumiguié', 'Nicola Fossati', 'Armando Stabile', 'Jean-Baptiste Beauval', 'Bernard Malavaud', 'Simone Scuderi', 'Francesco Barletta', 'Marco Moschini', 'Stefania Zamboni', 'Arnas Rakauskas', 'Zhe Tian', 'Pierre I Karakiewicz', 'Francesco De Cobelli', 'Francesco Porpiglia', 'Francesco Montorsi', 'Alberto Briganti']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Eur Urol""","""[""Reply to Jonathan Aning, Paul McCoubrie, and Jon Oxley's Letter to the Editor re: Giorgio Gandaglia, Guillaume Ploussard, Massimo Valerio, et al.

The majority of PCa deaths are due to metastasis that are highly resistant to current hormonal treatments; this state is called castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). In this study, we focused on the role of the lipid catabolism enzyme CPT1A in supporting CRPC growth in an androgen-dependent manner. We found that androgen withdrawal promoted the growth of CPT1A over-expressing (OE) tumors while it decreased the growth of CPT1A under-expressing (KD) tumors, increasing their sensitivity to enzalutamide. Mechanistically, we found that CPT1A-OE cells burned more lipid and showed increased histone acetylation changes that were partially reversed with a p300 specific inhibitor. Conversely, CPT1A-KD cells showed less histone acetylation when grown in androgen-deprived conditions. Our results suggest that CPT1A supports CRPC by supplying acetyl groups for histone acetylation, promoting growth and antiandrogen resistance.""","""['Molishree Joshi', 'Gergana E Stoykova', 'Maren Salzmann-Sullivan', 'Monika Dzieciatkowska', 'Lauren N Liebman', 'Gagan Deep', 'Isabel R Schlaepfer']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Cells""","""['Targeting CPT1B as a potential therapeutic strategy in castration-resistant and enzalutamide-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Galectin-3 Is Implicated in Tumor Progression and Resistance to Anti-androgen Drug Through Regulation of Androgen Receptor Signaling in Prostate Cancer.', 'Aberrant activation of super enhancer and choline metabolism drive antiandrogen therapy resistance in prostate cancer.', 'Enzalutamide: targeting the androgen signalling pathway in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Enzalutamide for the treatment of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Identification of a lipid metabolism-related gene for cancer immunotherapy.', 'New insights into lipid metabolism and prostate cancer (Review).', 'Mitochondrial CPT1A: Insights into structure, function, and basis for drug development.', 'A first-in-class HBO1 inhibitor WM-3835 inhibits castration-resistant prostate cancer cell growth in vitro and in vivo.', 'The role of lipid metabolism in tumor immune microenvironment and potential therapeutic strategies.']"""

The meta-analyses of microarray assays revealed that the HtrA4 level is changed in brain tumors and breast and prostate cancers, which suggests its involvement in oncogenesis. In spite of the HtrA4 involvement in important physiological and pathological processes, its function in the cell is poorly understood. In this work, using lung and breast cancer cell lines, we showed for the first time that the full-length HtrA4 and its N-terminally deleted variant promote cancer cell death induced by chemotherapeutic drugs by enhancing apoptosis. The effect is dependent on the HtrA4 proteolytic activity, and the N-terminally deleted HtrA4 is more efficient in the cell death stimulation. Furthermore, HtrA4 increases the effect of chemotherapeutics on the clonogenic potential and motility of cancer cells, and it increases cell cycle arrest at the G2/M phase. HtrA4 may modulate cell death by degrading the anti-apoptotic XIAP protein and also by proteolysis of the executioner pro-caspase 7 and cytoskeletal proteins, actin and β-tubulin. These findings provide new insight into the mechanism of the HtrA4 protease function in cell death and oncogenesis, and they may help to develop new anti-cancer therapeutic strategies.""","""['Tomasz Wenta', 'Michal Rychlowski', 'Miroslaw Jarzab', 'Barbara Lipinska']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Cells""","""['Cellular substrates and pro-apoptotic function of the human HtrA4 protease.', 'Discerning the mechanism of action of HtrA4: a serine protease implicated in the cell death pathway.', 'Upregulation of HtrA4 in the placentas of patients with severe pre-eclampsia.', 'HtrA serine proteases in cancers: A target of interest for cancer therapy.', 'HtrA serine proteases as potential therapeutic targets in cancer.', 'A Receptor Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor Sensitivity Prediction Model Identifies AXL Dependency in Leukemia.', 'Allosteric inhibition of HTRA1 activity by a conformational lock mechanism to treat age-related macular degeneration.', 'Comprehensive Analysis of Prognostic Microenvironment-Related Genes in Invasive Breast Cancer.', 'PSMC2 knockdown inhibits the progression of oral squamous cell carcinoma by promoting apoptosis via PI3K/Akt pathway.', 'Overview of Human HtrA Family Proteases and Their Distinctive Physiological Roles and Unique Involvement in Diseases, Especially Cancer and Pregnancy Complications.']"""

WWP2 isoforms select signal transducer Smad2/3 or inhibitor Smad7 substrates for degradation through different compositions of protein-protein interaction WW domains. The WW4 domain-containing WWP2-C induces Smad7 turnover in vivo and positively regulates the metastatic epithelial-mesenchymal transition programme. This activity and the overexpression of these isoforms in human cancers make them candidates for therapeutic intervention. Here, we use NMR spectroscopy to solve the solution structure of the WWP2 WW4 domain and observe the binding characteristics of Smad7 substrate peptide. We also reveal that WW4 has an enhanced affinity for a Smad7 peptide phosphorylated at serine 206 adjacent to the PPxY motif. Using the same approach, we show that the WW3 domain also binds Smad7 and has significantly enhanced Smad7 binding affinity when expressed in tandem with the WW4 domain. Furthermore, and relevant to these biophysical findings, we present evidence for a novel WWP2 isoform (WWP2C-ΔHECT) comprising WW3-WW4 tandem domains and a truncated HECT domain that can inhibit TGFβ signalling pathway activity, providing a further layer of complexity and feedback to the WWP2 regulatory apparatus.

Methods:   In this single-center, retrospective cohort study, men undergoing MRI of the prostate in 2015 and 2016 who had a transperineal template saturation biopsy within 6 months of MRI were included (n = 178; median age 64 y, interquartile range [IQR] 58-68 y; PSA 6.6 ng/ml, 4.6-9.7 ng/ml). The WG and TZ were segmented voxel-wise on T2-weighted transverse planes. The volumes and corresponding PSA-densities were calculated. Correlations with the Gleason score were assessed with Spearman's rho. Optimal thresholds of the PSA densities were computed using the Youden Index of the receiver-operating-characteristics curve. A p-value of ≤ 0.05 was considered statistically significant.  Results:   Median WG volume was 45 ml (IQR: 33.9-58.7 ml, range: 17.2-165.3 ml), median volume of the TZ was 27.3 ml (IQR: 19.2-39.3 ml, range: 9.0-141.1 ml). Both PSA density values, PSAD and TZPSAD, correlated significantly with the Gleason score: The PSAD (rho = 0.39) showed significantly weaker correlation than the TZPSAD (rho = 0.44, p = 0.05). ROC analysis revealed an ideal cut-off of 0.15 ng/ml2 for PSAD (95%-CI: 0.09-0.16 ng/ml2) and 0.22 ng/ml2 for the TZPSAD (0.15-0.32 ng/ml2) for discrimination between Gleason 3 + 4 and 4 + 3.  Conclusion:   The TZPSAD exhibited a stronger correlation with cancer dedifferentiation than PSAD and may thus be a better surrogate marker for cancer aggressiveness than PSAD.

The tumor immune microenvironment has been linked with disease outcome in PC. In the present study, the correlation between CTHRC1 with PC recurrence and the tumor immunological microenvironment was investigated. Using the data supplied by the Tumor Immune Estimation Resource (TIMER), the expression of CTHRC1, programmed cell death protein 1 (PD‑1), and programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 (PD‑L1) were analyzed. Immunohistochemical staining of CTHRC1, PD‑1 and PD‑L1 was performed using a tissue microarray construction of prostate adenocarcinoma (PRAD) specimens. In PRAD, an association was reported between the CTHRC1 expression and the disease free survival (DFS) rate (P=0.022). Overexpression of CTHRC1 was correlated with increased levels of PD‑1 (R=0.272, P=0.021) and PD‑L1 (R=0.298, P=0.016), elevated levels of infiltrating B cells (P=9.51e‑11), CD4+ cells (P=1.51e‑11), macrophages (P=8.25e‑5), neutrophils (P=2.17e‑9) and dendritic cells (P=3.13e‑13). Bioinformatics analysis revealed that CTHRC1 was correlated with the expression levels of matrix metalloproteinase‑9, mucin 1 and solute carrier organic anion transporter family member 2B1 genes, which exert an influence in PRAD.

In this study, low doses of Abrus agglutinin (AGG)-induced senescence through autophagy in prostate carcinoma cells (PC3) and inhibited proliferation. The inhibition of autophagy with 3-methyl adenine reversed AGG-induced senescence, thus confirming that AGG-triggered senescence required autophagy. AGG treatment also led to lipophagy-mediated accumulation of free fatty acids (FFAs), with a concomitant decrease in the number of lipid droplets. Lalistat, a lysosomal acid lipase inhibitor, abrogated AGG-induced lipophagy and senescence in PC3 cells, indicating that lipophagy is essential for AGG-induced senescence. The accumulation of FFAs increased reactive oxygen species generation, a known facilitator of senescence, which was also reduced in the presence of lalistat. Furthermore, AGG upregulated silent mating type information regulator 2 homolog 1 (SIRT1), while the presence of sirtinol reduced autophagy flux and the senescent phenotype in the AGG-treated cells. Mechanistically, AGG-induced cytoplasmic SIRT1 deacetylated a Lys residue on the cytoplasmic domain of lysosome-associated membrane protein 1 (LAMP1), an autolysosomal protein, resulting in lipophagy and senescence.

We aim at describing the experience of RARP at a high-volume single cancer center, proposing a modified technique of nerve-sparing prostatectomy and comparing functional outcomes throughout our experience. Materials and Methods: We retrospectively reviewed 1088 patients divided into group 1 (operated from May 2013 to November 2014), submitted to the standard transperitoneal robotic technique, and group 2 (operated from December 2014 to December 2017), submitted to extraperitoneal RARP with complete anterior peri-prostatic preservation technique and a clipless approach (no use of clips and cautious use of bipolar energy). We constructed a retrospective 1:2 matched-pair analysis considering age, body mass index, D'Amico risk classification, and American Society of Anesthesiologists classification as matching criteria. Univariate and multivariate Cox logistic regression analysis were used to identify predictors related to recovery of continence and erectile function. Results: Groups were comparable by clinical and demographic variables. There was no significant difference in overall continence rate. Mean time for continence recovery was 6.6 months in group 1 and 5.8 months in group 2. Erectile function recovery, with or without drugs, in 12 months was described in 53.5% in group 1 and 75% in group 2. Potency recovery was significantly earlier in group 2.

Therefore, cancer-specific mortality (CSM) rates after external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) vs. no local treatment (NLT) were tested in octogenarian PCa patients with LE < 10 years.  Methods:   Within the surveillance, epidemiology, and end results database (2004-2015), we identified 22,361 octogenarian clinically localized PCa patients who either received EBRT or NLT. Temporal trends, cumulative incidence plots and multivariable competing-risks regression analyses (MCR) were used after propensity score matching. Sensitivity analyses were performed according to D'Amico risk groups and LE > 5 years.  Results:   Of all, 7325 (32.8%) received EBRT vs. 15,036 (67.2%) received NLT. Rates of EBRT significantly increased over time (25.0-42.4%). Overall, 10-year CSM rates were 10.6% vs. 17.0% and 10-year other-cause mortality rates were 50.3% vs. 58.1%, in EBRT vs. NLT patients (both p < 0.001). In MCR focusing on the overall cohort, EBRT represented an independent predictor of lower CSM (hazard ratio: 0.5). In sensitivity analyses, hazard ratios of 0.5 (p < 0.001), 0.5 (p < 0.001) and 0.8 (p = 0.5) were, respectively, recorded in D'Amico high-, intermediate- and low-risk patients. In sensitivity analyses addressing patients with LE > 5 years virtually the same results were recorded.  Conclusions:   In octogenarian patients with LE < 10 years, EBRT seems to be associated with lower CSM in D'Amico high-risk, as well as in D'Amico intermediate-risk patients relative to their NLT counterparts.

AR-V7 may hold promise as a predictive biomarker, but there may be prognostic impact of AR-V7 positivity as well. To investigate the clinical value of AR-V7, we determined whether AR-V7 detection in CTCs in patients with mCRPC is associated with CTC counts and survival.  Methods:   Between December 2011 and January 2019, three prospective clinical trials collected clinical data of patients with mCRPC, who progressed after docetaxel and/or enzalutamide or abiraterone. Baseline (and follow-up) blood samples were withdrawn determining CTC count and AR-V7 expression. The majority of patients started cabazitaxel as the next line of treatment after AR-V7 characterisation.  Results:   A total of 127 samples were evaluable for the analysis of CTC count versus AR-V7 status. Although an association was observed between AR-V7 and CTC count in all patients with mCRPC (p = 0.017), no such association was found in the prognostic unfavourable subgroup of patients with ≥5 CTCs. After adjusting for clinical prognostic factors, AR-V7 expression in CTCs was not associated with overall survival (hazard ratio = 1.33, 95% confidence interval = 0.81-2.15, p = 0.25).  Conclusion:   We found that AR-V7 expression in CTCs had no additional prognostic value in patients with mCRPC, mostly treated with cabazitaxel. In patients with mCRPC with a predefined worse prognosis of a higher CTC count (≥5), a predictive biomarker is an important unmet medical need.

Traditionally, excision of the fistulous tract and concomitant cystectomy with urinary diversion and pubic symphyseal debridement has been done using an open approach. This paper presents patients who were successfully managed with this approach.  Methods and materials:   Between January 2007 and January 2018, all patients who underwent pubic symphyseal debridement with or without cystectomy were identified. We reviewed patients who underwent planned robot-assisted cystectomy with holmium laser debridement for osteomyelitis of the pubic symphysis as a result of urinary fistula. Data on clinical presentation, perioperative outcomes, and recurrence of urinary tract fistula and symptoms were collected.  Results:   Twelve patients underwent holmium laser debridement of the pubic symphysis during robot-assisted cystectomy for urinary fistula. Eleven patients had prior radiation treatments for prostate cancer with all having failed prior conservative management. Median operative time was 270 minutes with median length of stay of 5 days.

However, how this process is regulated has remained mostly elusive and the identification of new pathways that control mitochondrial integrity in cancer is an urgent priority.  Methods:   We studied clinically-annotated patient series of primary and metastatic prostate cancer, representative cases of multiple myeloma (MM) and publicly available genetic databases. Gene regulation studies involved chromatin immunoprecipitation, PCR amplification and Western blotting of conditional Myc-expressing cell lines. Transient or stable gene silencing was used to quantify mitochondrial functions in bioenergetics, outer membrane permeability, Ca2+ homeostasis, redox balance and cell death. Tumorigenicity was assessed by cell proliferation, colony formation and xenograft tumour growth.  Findings:   We identified Mitochondrial Fission Factor (MFF) as a novel transcriptional target of oncogenic Myc overexpressed in primary and metastatic cancer, compared to normal tissues. Biochemically, MFF isoforms, MFF1 and MFF2 associate with the Voltage-Dependent Anion Channel-1 (VDAC1) at the mitochondrial outer membrane, in vivo. Disruption of this complex by MFF silencing induces general collapse of mitochondrial functions with increased outer membrane permeability, loss of inner membrane potential, Ca2+ unbalance, bioenergetics defects and activation of cell death pathways. In turn, this inhibits tumour cell proliferation, suppresses colony formation and reduces xenograft tumour growth in mice.  Interpretation:   An MFF-VDAC1 complex is a novel regulator of mitochondrial integrity and actionable therapeutic target in cancer.""","""['Jae Ho Seo', 'Ekta Agarwal', 'Young Chan Chae', 'Yu Geon Lee', 'David S Garlick', 'Alessandra Maria Storaci', 'Stefano Ferrero', 'Gabriella Gaudioso', 'Umberto Gianelli', 'Valentina Vaira', 'Dario C Altieri']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""EBioMedicine""","""['MFF Regulation of Mitochondrial Cell Death Is a Therapeutic Target in Cancer.', 'Mff-Dependent Mitochondrial Fission Contributes to the Pathogenesis of Cardiac Microvasculature Ischemia/Reperfusion Injury via Induction of mROS-Mediated Cardiolipin Oxidation and HK2/VDAC1 Disassociation-Involved mPTP Opening.', 'Loss of MIEF1/MiD51 confers susceptibility to BAX-mediated cell death and PINK1-PRKN-dependent mitophagy.', 'The mitochondrial voltage-dependent anion channel 1 in tumor cells.', 'The role of Drp1 adaptor proteins MiD49 and MiD51\xa0in mitochondrial fission: implications for human disease.', 'Mitochondrial Alterations in Prostate Cancer: Roles in Pathobiology and Racial Disparities.', 'Non-Coding RNA-Dependent Regulation of Mitochondrial Dynamics in Cancer Pathophysiology.', 'Association of mitochondrial homeostasis and dynamic balance with malignant biological behaviors of gastrointestinal cancer.', 'Potential Anticarcinogenic Effects From Plasma of Older Adults After Exercise Training: An Exploratory Study.', 'Mitochondrial fission factor promotes cisplatin resistancein hepatocellular carcinoma.']"""

Galeterone inhibits CYP17 and AR, and induces AR protein degradation. We hypothesized that galeterone would be clinically superior to enzalutamide in AR-V7-positive (AR-V7+) mCRPC.  Objective:   To screen and characterize AR-V7+ mCRPC, and evaluate galeterone compared with enzalutamide.  Design, setting, and participants:   This was a multicenter randomized phase 3 trial; enzalutamide-, abiraterone-, and chemotherapy-naïve mCRPC patients had AR-V7 prescreening using a CTC-based mRNA assay.  Intervention:   AR-V7+ patients were randomized (1:1) to open-label galeterone or enzalutamide; planned sample size was 148.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   The primary endpoint was radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS). Baseline AR-V7 status was correlated with patient characteristics.  Results and limitations:   Overall, 953 men were prescreened for AR-V7; 323 (34%) had detectable CTCs, and 73/323 had AR-V7 mRNA. The AR-V7+ prevalence was 8% (73/953; 95% confidence interval [CI] 6-10%). AR-V7 was associated with indicators of advanced and high-volume disease at baseline, including higher prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level (p < 0.001), more bone metastases (p < 0.001), docetaxel for hormone-sensitive disease (p < 0.001), prior first-generation androgen deprivation therapy (p < 0.001), and shorter time from diagnosis to enrollment (p < 0.001). Of 73 eligible patients, 38 were randomized to galeterone (n=19) or enzalutamide (n=19); 35 dropped out before randomization. Owing to high censorship for the rPFS events, the data monitoring committee recommended early closure based on interim evidence that the primary endpoint would not be met. The PSA50 values were 2/16 (13%) and 8/19 (42%) for galeterone and enzalutamide respectively (proportion difference=-0.278, 95% CI -0.490 to 0.097).  Conclusions:   The prevalence of CTC mRNA AR-V7 in first-line mCRPC was 8% (95% CI 6-10%). AR-V7+ was associated with the characteristics of aggressive and advanced disease. These men had rapid disease progression. Development of galeterone will not be pursued.  Patient summary:   Of men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, 8% had the androgen receptor splice variant-7 (AR-V7) blood biomarker. The AR-V7+ patients had features of aggressive disease. Thirty-eight men were treated with either galeterone or enzalutamide; the trial was stopped early prior to determining efficacy because too many patients transitioned off the trial due to advancing cancer before having required radiographs.""","""['Mary-Ellen Taplin', 'Emmanuel S Antonarakis', 'Karen J Ferrante', 'Kerry Horgan', 'Brent Blumenstein', 'Fred Saad', 'Jun Luo', 'Johann S de Bono']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Eur Urol""","""['Androgen Receptor Splice Variant 7 and Efficacy of Taxane Chemotherapy in Patients With Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'AR-V7 in Peripheral Whole Blood of Patients with Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer: Association with Treatment-specific Outcome Under Abiraterone and Enzalutamide.', 'AR-V7 in circulating tumor cells cluster as a predictive biomarker of abiraterone acetate and enzalutamide treatment in castration-resistant prostate cancer patients.', 'Galeterone for the treatment of advanced prostate cancer: the evidence to date.', 'AR-V7 Androgen Receptor Variant as a Predictor of Response to Androgen-receptor Targeting Agents Used to Treat Castration-refractory Metastatic Prostate Cancer.', 'Utilization of Circulating Tumor Cells in the Management of Solid Tumors.', 'Co-expression and clinical utility of AR-FL and AR splice variants AR-V3, AR-V7 and AR-V9 in prostate cancer.', 'Novel Insights into the Role of the Antioxidants in Prostate Pathology.', 'A correlative biomarker study and integrative prognostic model in chemotherapy-naïve metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer treated with enzalutamide.', 'The androgen receptor-targeted proteolysis targeting chimera and other alternative therapeutic choices in overcoming the resistance to androgen deprivation treatment in prostate cancer.']"""

However, divergent immunohistochemical (IHC) findings have been reported for FSHR expression in tumor tissues, which could be due to the specificity of the antibodies used.  Methods:   Three frequently used antibodies (sc-7798, sc-13935, and FSHR323) were validated for their suitability in an immunohistochemical study for FSHR expression in different tissues. As quality control, two potential therapeutic anti-hFSHR Ylanthia® antibodies (Y010913, Y010916) were used. The specificity criteria for selection of antibodies were binding to native hFSHR of different sources, and no binding to non-related proteins. The ability of antibodies to stain the paraffin-embedded Flp-In Chinese hamster ovary (CHO)/FSHR cells was tested after application of different epitope retrieval methods.  Results:   From the five tested anti-hFSHR antibodies, only Y010913, Y010916, and FSHR323 showed specific binding to native, cell-presented hFSHR. Since Ylanthia® antibodies were selected to specifically recognize native FSHR, as required for a potential therapeutic antibody candidate, FSHR323 was the only antibody to detect the receptor in IHC/histochemical settings on transfected cells, and at markedly lower, physiological concentrations (ex., in Sertoli cells of human testes). The pattern of FSH323 staining noticed for ovarian, prostatic, and renal adenocarcinomas indicated that FSHR was expressed mainly in the peripheral tumor blood vessels.  Conclusion:   Of all published IHC antibodies tested, only antibody FSHR323 proved suitable for target validation of hFSHR in an IHC setting for cancer. Our studies could not confirm the previously reported FSHR overexpression in ovarian and prostate cancer cells. Instead, specific overexpression in peripheral tumor blood vessels could be confirmed after thorough validation of the antibodies used.""","""['Nina Moeker', 'Solveig Peters', 'Robert Rauchenberger', 'Nicolae Ghinea', 'Christian Kunz']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Antibodies (Basel)""","""['Extragonadal FSHR Expression and Function-Is It Real?', 'Toward gene therapy of primary ovarian failure: adenovirus expressing human FSH receptor corrects the Finnish C566T mutation.', 'In vitro inhibition of the bioactivity of follicle-stimulating hormone by antisera against a peptide representing part of the FSH-receptor.', 'Follicle-stimulating hormone induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition of epithelial ovarian cancer cells through follicle-stimulating hormone receptor PI3K/Akt-Snail signaling pathway.', 'Vascular Endothelial FSH Receptor, a Target of Interest for Cancer Therapy.', 'Inadequate detection of the FSHR complicates future research on extragonadal FSHR localization.', 'Recent advances in understanding gonadotropin signaling.', 'Anti-Angiogenic Therapy: Albumin-Binding Proteins Could Mediate Mechanisms Underlying the Accumulation of Small Molecule Receptor Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors in Normal Tissues with Potential Harmful Effects on Health.', 'Reduced Gonadotrophin Receptor Expression Is Associated with a More Aggressive Ovarian Cancer Phenotype.']"""

Using CRISPR/Cas9 technology, we removed three key cis-regulatory elements (CREs) from the chr11p13 region and also activated multiple open chromatin sites with CRISPRa in airway epithelial cells. Deletion of the CREs caused subtle changes in chromatin architecture and site-specific increases in EHF and ELF5. CRISPRa had most effect on ELF5 transcription. ELF5 levels are low in airway cells but higher in LNCaP (prostate) and T47D (breast) cancer cells. ATAC-seq in these lines revealed novel peaks of open chromatin at the 5' end of chr11p13 associated with an expressed ELF5 gene. Furthermore, 4C-seq assays identified direct interactions between the active ELF5 promoter and sites within the EHF locus, suggesting coordinate regulation between these TFs.

Industry sponsors are beginning to implement in trials the National Cancer Institute's Patient-Reported Outcomes version of the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (PRO-CTCAE), which was developed to allow patients to self-report symptomatic AEs and improve the quality of symptomatic AE detection.  Objectives:   To evaluate the feasibility of implementing PRO-CTCAE in a prespecified correlative analysis of the phase 3 COMET-2 trial and enumerate statistically significant between-group differences in symptomatic AEs using PRO-CTCAE and the CTCAE.  Design, setting, and participants:   This correlative study of 119 men in the randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 COMET-2 trial with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer who had undergone at least 2 prior lines of systemic treatment was conducted from March 2012 to July 2014. Participants completed PRO-CTCAE items using an automated telephone system from home prior to treatment and every 3 weeks during treatment. Statistical analysis was performed from May 2018 to June 2019.  Main outcomes and measures:   The proportion of patients who completed expected PRO-CTCAE self-reports was computed as a measure of feasibility.  Results:   Among the 119 men in the study (median age, 65 years [range, 44-80 years]), 534 of 587 (91.0%) expected PRO-CTCAE self-reports were completed, with consistently high rates of completion throughout participation. Rates of self-report adherence were similar between groups (cabozantinib s-maleate, 286 of 317 [90.2%]; and mitoxantrone hydrochloride-prednisone, 248 of 270 [91.9%]). Of 12 measured, patient-reported PRO-CTCAE symptomatic AEs, 4 reached statistical significance when comparing the proportion of patients with at least 1 postbaseline score greater than 0 between groups (differences ranged from 20.1% to 34.1% with higher proportions in the cabozantinib group; all P < .05), and use of a method for accounting for preexisting symptoms at baseline yielded 7 AEs with statistically significant differences between groups (differences ranged from 20.5% to 41.2% with higher proportions in the cabozantinib group; all P < .05). In the same analysis using investigator-reported CTCAE data, no statistically significant differences were found between groups for any symptomatic AEs.  Conclusions and relevance:   PRO-CTCAE data collection was feasible and improved the accuracy of symptomatic AE detection in a phase 3 cancer trial. This analysis adds to mounting evidence of the feasibility and value of patient-reported AEs in oncology, which should be considered for inclusion in cancer trials that incorporate AE evaluation.

Conjoint analysis is widely used in studies of consumer preference but has only recently been applied to measure patient utilities for health outcomes. We compared the reliability, feasibility, and internal and predictive validity of conjoint scaling methods against better established rating scale and time tradeoff methods for assessing prostate cancer utilities in men at risk for prostate cancer. Methods. In total, 194 men who were biopsy negative for prostate cancer were randomly assigned to complete 2 preference assessment modules, either conjoint analysis and a rating scale module or conjoint analysis and a time tradeoff module. Each participant's most important attribute was identified and evaluated in relation to age group (age <65, age 65 and older), education (high school, some college, college graduate), race/ethnicity (white, black, Latino), and relationship status (in significant relationship v. not). The methods were also evaluated in terms of ease of use and satisfaction. Results. Rating scales were rated as easiest to use and respondents were more satisfied with rating scales and conjoint in comparison to time tradeoffs. Rating scales and conjoint measures demonstrated significantly higher internal validity compared to time tradeoff when evaluated through R2 of the fitted utility function. The 3 methods were similar in terms of predictive validity, but conjoint analysis outperformed the rating scale method when patients were presented with novel combinations of attribute levels (68% correct v. 43%, P = 0.003). Conclusions. Rating scales and conjoint analysis exercises offer greater ease of use and higher satisfaction when measuring patient preferences in men biopsied for prostate cancer in comparison to time tradeoff exercises.

Lesions were targeted using TULSA with radical intent, except near neurovascular bundles (NVB). Robot-assisted-laparoscopic-prostatectomy (RALP) was performed at 3 weeks.

Foley-catheter removal was uneventful at 2-3 days. Compared to baseline, no differences in QoL were noted at 3 weeks.

The G84E mutation was genotyped using Sanger sequencing. The HOXB13 G84E germline mutation was detected in 2.9% of PC men (3/103) and not detected in any healthy man. Two mutation carriers originated from two of 25 families fulfilling hereditary prostate cancer criteria (HPC) and one mutation carrier from one family among 78 families without HPC (PC frequency: 8% vs. 1.3%, OR = 6.70, p = 0.13). In two of three mutation carriers, disease was detected above 60 years of age. There was a trend for a lower probability of 5-year survival in patients with G84E than in patients without it (66.7% vs. 94.0%, p = 0.08). The HOXB13 G84E germline mutation is associated with increased prostate cancer risk in Polish men, with hereditary form of the disease, and probably with older age at PC onset (> 60 years of age) and shorter survival.

Herein, we demonstrate that ERα coordinates its transcriptional output with selective modulation of mRNA translation. Importantly, translational perturbations caused by depletion of ERα largely manifest as ""translational offsetting"" of the transcriptome, whereby amounts of translated mRNAs and corresponding protein levels are maintained constant despite changes in mRNA abundance. Transcripts whose levels, but not polysome association, are reduced following ERα depletion lack features which limit translation efficiency including structured 5'UTRs and miRNA target sites. In contrast, mRNAs induced upon ERα depletion whose polysome association remains unaltered are enriched in codons requiring U34-modified tRNAs for efficient decoding. Consistently, ERα regulates levels of U34-modifying enzymes and thereby controls levels of U34-modified tRNAs.

We hypothesized that organ preference is reflected in additional, site-selective components within the metastatic gene expression programs. Expanding our prior analysis of 653 human gene expression profiles plus data from a murine model, we find that the release from the primary tumor is associated with a suppression of functions that are important for the identity of the organ of origin, such as a down-regulation of steroid hormone responsiveness in the disseminated foci derived from prostate cancer. Metastases adjust to their target microenvironment by up-regulating-even overexpressing-genes and genetic programs that are characteristic of that organ.

This study utilized human prostate cancer cell lines (LNCaP, 22Rv1 and PC-3), two different transgenic mouse models (TRAMP and Hi-Myc) and plasma specimens from a clinical study to explore the glycolysis inhibition potential of SFN. We found that SFN treatment: (i) decreased real-time extracellular acidification rate in LNCaP, but not in PC-3 cell line; (ii) significantly downregulated expression of hexokinase II (HKII), pyruvate kinase M2 and/or lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA) in vitro in cells and in vivo in neoplastic lesions in the prostate of TRAMP and Hi-Myc mice; and (iii) significantly suppressed glycolysis in prostate of Hi-Myc mice as measured by ex vivo1H magnetic resonance spectroscopy. SFN treatment did not decrease glucose uptake or expression of glucose transporters in cells. Overexpression of c-Myc, but not constitutively active Akt, conferred protection against SFN-mediated downregulation of HKII and LDHA protein expression and suppression of lactate levels.

In this study, we collected hundreds of PCa tissues and serum and urine samples from patients to verify the upregulated expression of PC3-secreted microprotein (PSMP) in PCa tumor tissues with high Gleason scores. According to biopsy results, PSMP expression was found related to extraprostatic extension (EPE), contributing to PCa metastasis. Mechanistically, recombinant PSMP protein could promote the proliferation both in vitro and in vivo, and rhPSMP could promote epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of PC3 in vitro. Additionally, PSMP could also influence cytokine production in the xenograft model and monocyte migration and macrophage polarization in vitro.

Saturated fat intake (SFI) is also associated with an enhanced MYC transcriptional signature in prostate cancer patients.

Design:   National register based cohort study.  Setting:   Sweden from January 1994 to December 2014.  Participants:   1 181 490 children born alive in Sweden during 1994-2014 to the same number of fathers. Fathers were grouped according to fertility status by mode of conception: 20 618 by in vitro fertilisation (IVF), 14 882 by intra-cytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI), and 1 145 990 by natural conception.  Main outcome measures:   Prostate cancer diagnosis, age of onset, and androgen deprivation therapy (serving as proxy for advanced or metastatic malignancy).  Results:   Among men achieving fatherhood by IVF, by ICSI, and by non-assisted means, 77 (0.37%), 63 (0.42%), and 3244 (0.28%), respectively, were diagnosed as having prostate cancer. Mean age at onset was 55.9, 55.1, and 57.1 years, respectively. Men who became fathers through assisted reproduction had a statistically significantly increased risk of prostate cancer compared with men who conceived naturally (hazard ratio 1.64, 95% confidence interval 1.25 to 2.15, for ICSI; 1.33, 1.06 to 1.66, for IVF). They also had an increased risk of early onset disease (that is, diagnosis before age 55 years) (hazard ratio 1.86, 1.25 to 2.77, for ICSI; 1.51, 1.09 to 2.08, for IVF). Fathers who conceived through ICSI and developed prostate cancer received androgen deprivation therapy to at least the same extent as the reference group (odds ratio 1.91; P=0.07).  Conclusions:   Men who achieved fatherhood through assisted reproduction techniques, particularly through ICSI, are at increased risk for early onset prostate cancer and thus constitute a risk group in which testing and careful long term follow-up for prostate cancer may be beneficial.""","""['Yahia Al-Jebari', 'Angel Elenkov', 'Elin Wirestrand', 'Indra Schütz', 'Aleksander Giwercman', 'Yvonne Lundberg Giwercman']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""BMJ""","""['Male infertility linked to risk of prostate cancer.', 'Re: Risk of Prostate Cancer for Men Fathering through Assisted Reproduction: Nationwide Population Based Register Study.', 'Criteria for academic promotion in medicine.', 'Paternity through use of assisted reproduction technology in male adult and childhood cancer survivors: a nationwide register study.', 'Testosterone replacement therapy in men who conceived with intracytoplasmic sperm injection: nationwide register study.', 'Men becoming fathers by intracytoplasmic sperm injection were more often born small for gestational age.', 'Health outcomes of children born after IVF/ICSI: a review of current expert opinion and literature.', 'Risk of spontaneous preterm birth in singleton pregnancies conceived after IVF/ICSI treatment: meta-analysis of cohort studies.', 'Lifestyle and environmental risk factors for unexplained male infertility: study protocol for Australian Male Infertility Exposure (AMIE), a case-control study.', 'Feasibility analysis of incorporating infertility into medical insurance in China.', 'Male infertility and somatic health - insights into lipid damage as a mechanistic link.', 'Is early-onset cancer an emerging global epidemic?

We aimed to address this unmet opportunity by developing anti-TOX therapeutics with the use of computer-aided drug discovery methods. The available NMR-resolved structure of the TOX protein was used to model its DNA-binding HMG-box domain. To investigate the druggability of the corresponding protein-DNA interface on TOX, we performed a pilot virtual screening of 200,000 small molecules using in silico docking and identified 'hot spots' for drug-binding on the HMG-box domain. We then performed a large-scale virtual screening of 7.6 million drug-like compounds that were available from the ZINC15 database. As a result, a total of 140 top candidate compounds were selected for subsequent in vitro validation.

At the time of treatment planning, predicted portal images were created for each segment of the VMAT arc, and at the time of delivery, intrafraction monitoring software polled the portal imager to read new images as they became available. The predicted and measured images were compared and displayed on a segment basis. In particular, a running sum of images from ten segments (a 'section') was investigated, with mean absolute difference between predicted and measured images being quantified. Images for 13 prostate patients were used to identify appropriate tolerance values for this statistic. Errors in monitor units of 2%-10%, field size of 2-10 mm, field position of 2-10 mm and path length of 10-50 mm were deliberately introduced into the treatment plans and delivered to a water-equivalent phantom and the sensitivity of the method to these errors was investigated. Gross errors were also considered for one case. The patient images show considerable variability from segment to segment, but when using a section of the arc the variability is reduced, so that the maximum value of mean absolute difference between predicted and measured images is reduced to below 12%, after excluding the first 10% of segments. This tolerance level is also found to be applicable for delivery of the plans to a water-equivalent phantom. Using this as a tolerance level for the error plans, a 10% increase in monitor units is detected, 4 mm increase or shift in multileaf collimator settings can be detected, and an air gap of dimensions 40 mm × 50 mm is detected. Gross errors can also be detected instantly after the first 10% of segments.

Patients undergoing persistent chemotherapy often develop drug-induced senescence. Docetaxel, an FDA-approved treatment for prostate cancer, is known to induce cellular senescence which often limits the overall survival of patients. Strategic therapies that counter the cellular and drug-induced senescence are an unmet clinical need. Towards this an effort was made to develop a novel therapeutic strategy that targets and removes senescent cells from the tumors, we developed a nanoformulation of tannic acid-docetaxel self-assemblies (DSAs). The construction of DSAs was confirmed through particle size measurements, spectroscopy, thermal, and biocompatibility studies. This formulation exhibited enhanced in vitro therapeutic activity in various biological functional assays with respect to native docetaxel treatments. Microarray and immunoblot analysis results demonstrated that DSAs exposure selectively deregulated senescence associated TGFβR1/FOXO1/p21 signaling. Decrease in β-galactosidase staining further suggested reversion of drug-induced senescence after DSAs exposure. Additionally, DSAs induced profound cell death by activation of apoptotic signaling through bypassing senescence. Furthermore, in vivo and ex vivo imaging analysis demonstrated the tumor targeting behavior of DSAs in mice bearing PC-3 xenograft tumors. The antisenescence and anticancer activity of DSAs was further shown in vivo by inhibiting TGFβR1 proteins and regressing tumor growth through apoptotic induction in the PC-3 xenograft mouse model. Overall, DSAs exhibited such advanced features due to a natural compound in the formulation as a matrix/binder for docetaxel. Overall, DSAs showed superior tumor targeting and improved cellular internalization, promoting docetaxel efficacy. These findings may have great implications in prostate cancer therapy.""","""['Prashanth K B Nagesh', 'Pallabita Chowdhury', 'Elham Hatami', 'Sonam Kumari', 'Vivek Kumar Kashyap', 'Manish K Tripathi', 'Santosh Wagh', 'Bernd Meibohm', 'Subhash C Chauhan', 'Meena Jaggi', 'Murali M Yallapu']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""ACS Appl Mater Interfaces""","""[""Distinct phenotypes and 'bystander' effects of senescent tumour cells induced by docetaxel or immunomodulatory cytokines."", 'Blockade of γ-Glutamylcyclotransferase Enhances Docetaxel Growth Inhibition of Prostate Cancer Cells.', 'Reduction of circular RNA Foxo3 promotes prostate cancer progression and chemoresistance to docetaxel.', 'Paclitaxel and docetaxel resistance in prostate cancer: Molecular mechanisms and possible therapeutic strategies.', 'Targeting tumor cell senescence and polyploidy as potential therapeutic strategies.', 'Recent Progress in Nanotechnology Improving the Therapeutic Potential of Polyphenols for Cancer.', 'Glutathione-Responsive Tannic Acid-Assisted FRET Nanomedicine for Cancer Therapy.', 'Indocyanine Green-based Glow Nanoparticles Probe for Cancer Imaging.', 'Cellular Senescence as a Brake or Accelerator for Oncogenic Transformation and Role in Lymphatic Metastasis.', 'Nano-Based Drug Delivery of Polyphenolic Compounds for Cancer Treatment: Progress, Opportunities, and Challenges.']"""

Methods:   We evaluated ustekinumab as 8-week induction therapy and 44-week maintenance therapy in patients with moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis. A total of 961 patients were randomly assigned to receive an intravenous induction dose of ustekinumab (either 130 mg [320 patients] or a weight-range-based dose that approximated 6 mg per kilogram of body weight [322]) or placebo (319). Patients who had a response to induction therapy 8 weeks after administration of intravenous ustekinumab were randomly assigned again to receive subcutaneous maintenance injections of 90 mg of ustekinumab (either every 12 weeks [172 patients] or every 8 weeks [176]) or placebo (175). The primary end point in the induction trial (week 8) and the maintenance trial (week 44) was clinical remission (defined as a total score of ≤2 on the Mayo scale [range, 0 to 12, with higher scores indicating more severe disease] and no subscore >1 [range, 0 to 3] on any of the four Mayo scale components).  Results:   The percentage of patients who had clinical remission at week 8 among patients who received intravenous ustekinumab at a dose of 130 mg (15.6%) or 6 mg per kilogram (15.5%) was significantly higher than that among patients who received placebo (5.3%) (P<0.001 for both comparisons). Among patients who had a response to induction therapy with ustekinumab and underwent a second randomization, the percentage of patients who had clinical remission at week 44 was significantly higher among patients assigned to 90 mg of subcutaneous ustekinumab every 12 weeks (38.4%) or every 8 weeks (43.8%) than among those assigned to placebo (24.0%) (P = 0.002 and P<0.001, respectively). The incidence of serious adverse events with ustekinumab was similar to that with placebo.

Patients and methods:   One hundred eleven male patients with a history of or newly diagnosed germ cell tumors were evaluable. Biospecimens obtained before confirmed clinical events were analyzed for miR371 expression with blinding of providers and laboratory personnel to analytic results or clinical status, respectively. Cases (patients with clinically confirmed active germ cell malignancy [aGCM]) and controls (patients with no clinically confirmed aGCM) were assigned over the course of the management. Patients were assigned risk status (high, low, or moderate) based on the composite clinical picture at time points in management.  Results:   Considering all cases and controls and results of prospectively obtained biosamples analyzed for miR371 expression, 46 (35%) of 132 samples had clinically confirmed aGCM over the course of management; 44 (96%) of these 46 patients had plasma miR371 expression (true positives) with no false positives. Two (4%) of 46 patients had no miRNA expression despite pathologic confirmation of aGCM (false negatives). Plasma miR371 expression in confirmed aGCM had a specificity, sensitivity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of 100%, 96%, 100%, and 98%, respectively. Interpretation of sensitivity and negative predictive value is limited by modest follow-up. Specificity and sensitivity were 100% and 98%, 100% and 92%, and 100% and 97% in the low-, moderate-, and high-risk groups, respectively, with a median follow-up time of 15 months.  Conclusion:   Plasma miR371 expression predicts aGCM with high specificity and positive predictive value.

To investigate the impact of PSM, its length, the focality, and the PSM Gleason, on biochemical recurrence (BCR) in organ-confined RP patients.  Methods:   Within a high-volume center database, we identified patients who harbored organ-confined (pathologic stage T2 disease) prostate cancer (PCa) at RP (2010-2016). Kaplan-Meier analyses and multivariable Cox regression models were used to test the effect of the PSM on the BCR risk.  Results:   Overall, 8770 patients were identified. Of those, 6.6% (n = 579) harbored PSM. BCR-free survival at 72 months after RP was 77.7% vs 89.0% for patients with vs without PSM (P < .001). BCR-free survival rates at 72 months were 77.4% vs 73.6% (P = .1) for unifocal vs multifocal PSM, 77.2% vs 71.8% (P = .03) for Gleason pattern 3 vs ≥4 at the margin and 88.4% vs 66.3% (P < .001) for <3 vs ≥3 mm length of margin. In multivariable Cox models PSM was an independent predictor for BCR (hazard ratio [HR] = 2.40, P < .001). However, in subgroups with PSM, only ≥3 mm PSM represented an independent predictor (HR = 1.93, P = .04), while focality and Gleason at the margin were no significant predictors.  Conclusion:   PSM represents an independent predictor for BCR in organ-confined PCa at RP. Moreover, Gleason ≥4 at the margin and ≥3 mm PSM length were associated with worse BCR-free survival.

In our device, stacked layers of chemically-functionalized microfluidic channels capture millions of white blood cells (WBCs) in parallel without getting saturated and the leuko-depleted blood is post-filtered with a 3 μm-pore size membrane filter to eliminate anucleated blood cells. This hybrid negative enrichment approach facilitated direct extraction of viable CTCs off the chip on a membrane filter for downstream analysis. Immunofluorescence imaging of enriched cells showed ∼90% tumor cell recovery rate from simulated samples spiked with prostate, breast or ovarian cancer cells. We also demonstrated the feasibility of our approach for processing clinical samples by isolating prostate cancer CTCs directly from a 10 mL whole blood sample.""","""['Chia-Heng Chu', 'Ruxiu Liu', 'Tevhide Ozkaya-Ahmadov', 'Mert Boya', 'Brandi E Swain', 'Jacob M Owens', 'Enerelt Burentugs', 'Mehmet Asim Bilen', 'John F McDonald', 'A Fatih Sarioglu']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Lab Chip""","""['3D printed microfluidic devices for circulating tumor cells (CTCs) isolation.', 'Negative enrichment of circulating tumor cells from unmanipulated whole blood with a 3D printed device.', 'Efficient microfluidic negative enrichment of circulating tumor cells in blood using roughened PDMS.', 'Microfluidic Devices for Circulating Tumor Cells Isolation and Subsequent Analysis.', 'Technologies for circulating tumor cell separation from whole blood.', 'Recent Advances in Methods for Circulating Tumor Cell Detection.', 'Application of Microfluidics in Detection of Circulating Tumor Cells.', 'Recent Advances in Microfluidic Platform for Physical and Immunological Detection and Capture of Circulating Tumor Cells.', 'Nanomaterial-Based Immunocapture Platforms for the Recognition, Isolation, and Detection of Circulating Tumor Cells.', 'Recent advances in isolation and detection of circulating tumor cells with a microfluidic system.']"""

We compared the prognostic performance of the total number of lymph nodes examined (TNLE), number of metastatic lymph node (NMLN), LNR, and LODDS in prostate cancer.  Methods:   Data from 1400 patients diagnosed with prostate cancer between 2004 and 2009 who underwent lymphadenectomy were extracted from the Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results database. Kaplan-Meier methods and multivariable Cox regression analysis were used to evaluate the prognostic value of different lymph node staging schemes in patients with lymph node metastasis.  Results:   Univariate analysis showed that age, T stage, radiotherapy history, Gleason score, LNR classification, LODDS classification, and NMLN except TNLE classification were significant prognostic factors for overall survival. In multivariate analysis, LNR classification, LODDS classification, and NMLN but TNLE classification remained significant prognostic factors for overall survival. LNR classification had the highest C-index (0.672; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.609-0.734) and the lowest Akaike information criterion (AIC) (4057.018), indicating the best prognostic performance. Scatter plots showed that LODDS increased with increasing LNR, exhibiting a strong overall correlation between these two lymph node staging methods (r2 = 0.9072). LNR and LODDS generally increased with increasing NMLN, although the correlation was relatively low.

Methods:   Data from 63 men with nmCRPC who underwent alternative FGA therapy (bicalutamide, flutamide, or chlormadinone acetate) as first-line therapy after failure of primary androgen-deprivation therapy (PADT) between 2004 and 2017 at Hiroshima University Hospital and affiliated hospitals were retrospectively investigated.

We profiled the expression level of miRNAs contained in semen exosomes from men with moderately increased PSA levels to assess their usefulness, either alone or in addition to PSA marker, as non-invasive biomarkers, for the early efficient diagnosis and prognosis of PCa. An altered miRNA expression pattern was found by a high throughput profiling analysis in PCa when compared with healthy individuals (HCt) exosomal semen samples. The presence of vasectomy was taken into account for the interpretation of results. Fourteen miRNAs were selected for miRNA validation as PCa biomarkers in a subsequent set of semen samples. In this explorative study, we describe miRNA-based models, which included miRNA expression values together with PSA levels, that increased the classification function of the PSA screening test with diagnostic and/or prognostic potential: [PSA + miR-142-3p + miR-142-5p + miR-223-3p] model (AUC:0,821) to discriminate PCa from BPH (Sn:91,7% Sp:42,9% vs Sn:100% Sp:14,3%); and [PSA + miR-342-3p + miR-374b-5p] model (AUC: 0,891) to discriminate between GS ≥ 7 tumours and men presenting PSA ≥ 4 ng/ml with no cancer or GS6 tumours (Sn:81,8% Sp:95% vs Sn:54,5% Sp:90%). The pathway analysis of predicted miRNA target genes supports a role for these miRNAs in PCa aetiology and/or progression. Our study shows semen exosome miRNA-based models as molecular biomarkers with the potential to improve PCa diagnosis/prognosis efficiency.

In this study, we generated two anti-androgen and castration resistant prostate cancer cell models that do not rely on AR activity for growth despite robust AR expression (AR indifferent). They are thus resistant against all modern AR signalling inhibitors. Both cell lines display cross-resistance against the chemotherapeutic drug docetaxel due to MCL1 upregulation but remain sensitive to the PARP inhibitor olaparib and the pan-BCL inhibitor obatoclax. RNA-seq analysis of the anti-androgen resistant cell lines identified hyper-activation of the E2F cell-cycle master regulator as driver of AR indifferent growth, which was caused by deregulation of cyclin D/E, E2F1, RB1, and increased Myc activity.

The present clinical trial was designed to determine if S-glutathionylated serine protease inhibitors (serpins) in blood could be used as biomarkers of exposure to radiation. 56 male prostate cancer patients treated with radiotherapy were enrolled in the trial and levels of S-glutathionylated serpins A1 and A3 were assessed by immunoblotting. Patients were classified into three groups: (1) external beam radiation therapy (EBRT); (2) brachytherapy (BT); (3) both EBRT and BT. Prior to treatment, baseline plasma levels of both unmodified and S-glutathionylated serpins were similar in each group. We identified elevated plasma levels of S-glutathionylated serpin A1 monomer, trimer and serpin A3 monomer in patient blood following radiation. Maximal increased levels of these S-glutathionylated serpins were correlated with increased duration of radiotherapy treatments. We conclude that it is practical to quantify patient plasma S-glutathionylated serpins and that these post-translationally modified proteins are candidate biomarkers for measuring radiation exposure.

The tumor suppressor function of PTEN is attributed to its lipid phosphatase activity that counters PI3K action. Here, we report a PTEN-ARID4B-PI3K axis in which PTEN inhibits expression of ARID4B, while ARID4B is a transcriptional activator of the PI3K subunit genes PIK3CA and PIK3R2 that are crucial for activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway. Reciprocal binding of ARID4B and histone H1 to the PIK3CA and PIK3R2 promoters modulates chromatin condensation, suggesting a mechanism by which ARID4B activates these promoters. Functional analyses reveals that ARID4B is required for prostate tumorigenesis when PTEN is deficient. The biological significance is further substantiated by the existence of a PTEN/ARID4B/PIK3CA three-gene signature that improves the predictive power for prostate cancer recurrence in patients.

We conducted a clinical trial of stereotactic hypofractionated radiation therapy delivered in once-weekly fractions on patients with all-risk non-metastatic disease to test feasibility, acute toxicities and patient-reported outcomes.  Materials and methods:   In this phase I/II study, 30 patients with prostatic adenocarcinoma, any Gleason score, T1-4N0 and prostate-specific antigen ≤60 ng/ml were treated with volumetric intensity modulated arc radiation therapy to a dose of 35 Gy in five fractions delivered once weekly. Patients with high-risk disease also received elective nodal irradiation to a dose of 25 Gy in five fractions simultaneously. Androgen deprivation was offered to intermediate- and high-risk patients. The primary outcome was acute toxicity. Secondary outcome measures included biochemical control and late toxicity. Patient-reported outcomes were measured using the International Prostate Symptom Score and European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality-of-Life Questionnaire (QLQ).  Results:   All 30 patients completed treatment per-protocol. Most patients had T3 (60%) and Gleason 7 (50%) tumours. The median prostate-specific antigen was 17 ng/ml. High-risk disease was present in 20 patients (66.7%). There was a low incidence of acute toxicities (grade 2 + urinary 3.3%, grade 2 rectal 0%). Within the EORTC QLQ framework, only the urinary symptom score showed a clinically meaningful worsening from a mean of 20/100 at baseline to 34/100 at the end of treatment (P < 0.001), but reduced to 24/100 at 6 months (P = 0.08).

Enzalutamide is currently the recommended treatment; however, the efficacy and safety of enzalutamide and flutamide after combined androgen blockade therapy with bicalutamide, has not been compared.  Methods:   Patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer who received combined androgen blockade therapy with bicalutamide were randomly assigned to receive either enzalutamide or flutamide. The primary endpoint for efficacy was the 3-month prostate-specific antigen response rate. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02346578) and the University hospital Medical Information Network (UMIN000016301).  Results:   Overall, 103 patients were enrolled. The 3- (80.8% vs. 35.3%; p < 0.001) and 6-month (73.1% vs. 31.4%; p < 0.001) prostate-specific antigen response rates were higher in the enzalutamide than in the flutamide group.

The BrachyView coordinates combined with conventional transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) imaging, provides the possibility to localise the effective position of the implanted seeds inside the prostate volume, providing a unique tool for intra-operative verification of the quality of the implantation. This research presents the first complete LDR brachytherapy plan reconstructed by the BrachyView system and is used to evaluate the effectiveness of an imaging algorithm with baseline subtraction.  Methods:   A plan featuring 98 I-125 brachytherapy seeds, with an average activity of 0.248 mCi, were implanted into a prostate gel phantom under TRUS guidance. Images of implanted seeds were obtained by the BrachyView after the implantation of seeds. The baseline subtraction algorithm is applied as a pixel-to-pixel counts subtraction and is applied to every second projection obtained after the implantation of each needle. Seed positions and effectiveness of the baseline reconstruction in the identification of seeds were verified by a high-resolution post-implant CT scan.  Results:   A complete brachytherapy plan has been reconstructed with a 100% detection rate. This is possible due to the effectiveness of the baseline subtraction, with its application an overall increase of 11.3% in position accuracy and 8.2% increase in detection rate was noted.

Recent evidence suggests that, for patients with a PSA > 0.34 ng/ml, the radiotherapy treatment volume should include not only the prostate bed but also the pelvic lymph nodes. We describe the patterns of failure after prostate bed radiotherapy, focussing on the proportion of patients with radiologically confirmed pelvic nodal failure only, in the absence of distant disease.  Materials and methods:   Patients included were men receiving prostate bed radiotherapy at the Royal Marsden Hospital between 1997 and 2013. The key outcome of interest was the pattern of radiologic failure after prostate bed radiotherapy. Baseline characteristics of patients experiencing pelvic nodal failure without distant disease were compared versus all other relapse patterns. Comparisons were by Chi-square test, with multiple testing adjusted p < 0.005 significant.  Results:   140 of 322 patients developed biochemical failure after salvage RT. Radiologic failure occurred in 89 patients. 35 of the 89 patients (39%) with radiologic failure had pelvic nodal failure without distant disease, with no significant differences in baseline characteristics when compared to all other patients. The rate of pelvic nodal failure was the same for patients with PSA above or below 0.34 ng/ml (16/149, 95% CI = 6-17% vs 19/171, 95% CI = 7-17%).  Conclusions:   Pelvic lymph node disease, without more distant disease, is a common site of failure in men receiving radiotherapy to the prostate bed, including those with PSA < 0.34 ng/ml. This observation informs the case for including the pelvic lymph nodes in the radiotherapy treatment volume.""","""['Douglas H Brand', 'Joanna I Parker', 'David P Dearnaley', 'Rosalind Eeles', 'Robert Huddart', 'Vincent Khoo', 'Julia Murray', 'Yae-Eun Suh', 'Alison C Tree', 'Nicholas van As', 'Chris Parker']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Radiother Oncol""","""['Patterns of Clinical Recurrence of Node-positive Prostate Cancer and Impact on Long-term Survival.', 'Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging Is an Independent Predictor of Salvage Radiotherapy Outcomes After Radical Prostatectomy.', 'Stage T1-2 prostate cancer: a multivariate analysis of factors affecting biochemical and clinical failures after radical prostatectomy.', 'Salvage reirradiation for locoregional failure after radiation therapy for prostate cancer: who, when, where and how?', 'Prostate specific antigen only progression of prostate cancer.', 'Treatment-related toxicity using prostate bed versus prostate bed and pelvic lymph node radiation therapy following radical prostatectomy: A national population-based study.', 'The Utility of 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT in Decisions Regarding Administering Salvage Radiotherapy to Men with Prostate Cancer.', 'How can we best manage biochemical failure after radical prostatectomy?', 'Best Approaches and Updates for Prostate Cancer Biochemical Recurrence.', 'Mapping of Recurrence Sites Following Adjuvant or Salvage Radiotherapy for Prostate Cancer Patients.']"""

The results of this study clearly show that Ang1-9 and Ang3-7 exert different/opposite effects on in vitro biological properties of prostate cells. It appears that Ang1-9 has pro-cancer activities via the ability to induce cell divisions, enhance cell motility and stimulate the expression of such genes as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), hypoxia-inducible factors (HIF-1), vimentin (VIM) and REL proto-oncogene, NF-kB subunit (REL). On the contrary, Ang3-7 did not show any mitogenic activity. Furthermore, this peptide hormone limited the migration of PNT1A cells probably by downregulation of VEGF and VIM expression. Finally, it is worth noting that both angiotensins have the ability to modulate gene expression for angiotensin receptors. Unfortunately, we could not unequivocally identify the type of angiotensin receptor responsible for signal transduction pathway involved in PNT1A cell survival and proliferation.

As the long-term survival of patients with carcinoma rises, the number of patients with symptomatic spine metastases is also increasing. In our tertiary referral center, patients usually present rapidly progressive neurologic disorders, which require an urgent treatment decision. Treatment options include extensive 360° stabilizations. These complex interventions are not always readily available. We examined the extent to which the patient population benefited from decompressive surgery without stabilization. We hypothesize that patients benefit from merely dorsal decompression, which preserves stability when they experience symptomatic spine metastases.  Methods:   We performed a retrospective analysis of electronic patient data from 19 patients, who were treated for symptomatic spine metastases by hemilaminectomy between 2009 and 2017. We evaluated the preoperative and postoperative neurologic functions using the American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) Impairment Scale. A comparative literature analysis was carried out to assess the Spinal Neoplastic Instability Score, Tokuhashi score, and Tomita score.  Results:   Nine participants had prostate cancer, 4 had mammary carcinoma, 3 had bronchial carcinoma, and 3 had other cancers. The median preoperative ASIA score was C, postoperatively, the score significantly improved to D (sign test P = 0.002). None of the patients needed stabilization within the follow-up period of up to 56 months.  Conclusions:   In our patient population, minimal intervention could significantly improve neurologic disorders. This outcome was seen over the whole study period. Even though different scoring systems suggest stabilization, our results show that spinal decompression alone might be indicated as well.""","""['Mareike Müller', 'Yousef Abusabha', 'Hans-Jakob Steiger', 'Athanasios Petridis', 'Richard Bostelmann']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""World Neurosurg""","""['The surgical management of metastatic spinal tumors based on an Epidural Spinal Cord Compression (ESCC) scale.', 'Is the Posterior-Only Approach Sufficient for Treating Cervical Spine Metastases?

Tumor cells that metastasize to adipocyte-rich bone marrow take advantage of the interplay between metabolic and inflammatory pathways to activate prosurvival mechanisms that allow them to thrive and escape therapy. Using in vitro and in vivo models of marrow adiposity, we demonstrate that metastatic prostate carcinoma cells engage bone marrow adipocytes in a functional cross-talk that promotes IL1β expression in tumor cells. Tumor-supplied IL1β contributes to adipocyte lipolysis and regulates a proinflammatory phenotype in adipocytes via upregulation of COX-2 and MCP-1. We further show that the enhanced activity of the IL1β/COX-2/MCP-1 axis and a resulting increase in PGE2 production by adipocytes coincide with augmented hypoxia signaling and activation of prosurvival pathways in tumor cells, revealing a potential mechanism of chemoresistance. The major consequence of this interplay is the reduced response of prostate cancer cells to docetaxel, a phenomenon sensitive to the inhibition of lipolysis. IMPLICATIONS: Studies presented herein highlight adipocyte lipolysis as a tumor-regulated metabolic event that engages proinflammatory cross-talk in the microenvironment to promote prostate cancer progression in bone. Understanding the impact of bone marrow adipose tissue on tumor adaptation, survival, and chemotherapy response is fundamentally important, as current treatment options for metastatic prostate cancer are palliative.""","""['Mackenzie K Herroon#', 'Jonathan D Diedrich#', 'Erandi Rajagurubandara', 'Carly Martin', 'Krishna R Maddipati', 'Seongho Kim', 'Elisabeth I Heath', 'James Granneman', 'Izabela Podgorski']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Mol Cancer Res""","""['Bone marrow adipocytes promote the Warburg phenotype in metastatic prostate tumors via HIF-1α activation.', 'An ARC-Regulated IL1β/Cox-2/PGE2/β-Catenin/ARC Circuit Controls Leukemia-Microenvironment Interactions and Confers Drug Resistance in AML.', 'The Tpl2 Kinase Regulates the COX-2/Prostaglandin E2 Axis in Adipocytes in Inflammatory Conditions.', 'Bone marrow fat: linking adipocyte-induced inflammation with skeletal metastases.', 'Role of bone marrow adipocytes in leukemia and chemotherapy challenges.', 'Emphasis on Adipocyte Transformation: Anti-Inflammatory Agents to Prevent the Development of Cancer-Associated Adipocytes.', 'IL-1β expression driven by androgen receptor absence or inactivation promotes prostate cancer bone metastasis.', 'Role of Interleukin-1 family in bone metastasis of prostate cancer.', 'Adipocyte-Cancer Cell Interactions in the Bone Microenvironment.', 'Non-Invasive Characterization of Experimental Bone Metastasis in Obesity Using Multiparametric MRI and PET/CT.']"""

Recently, 3 different criteria for interpretation of PSMA PET were published: the European Association of Nuclear Medicine (EANM) criteria, the Prostate Cancer Molecular Imaging Standardized Evaluation criteria, and the PSMA Reporting and Data System. We compared these 3 criteria in terms of interreader, intrareader, and intercriteria agreement. Methods: Data from 104 patients prospectively enrolled in research protocols at our institution were retrospectively reviewed. The cohort consisted of 2 groups: 47 patients (mean age, 64.2 y old) who underwent Glu-NH-CO-NH-Lys-(Ahx)-[68Ga(HBED-CC)] (68Ga-PSMA11) PET/MRI for initial staging of biopsy-proven intermediate- or high-risk PC, and 57 patients (mean age, 70.5 y old) who underwent 68Ga-PSMA11 PET/CT because of biochemically recurrent PC. Three nuclear medicine physicians independently evaluated all 68Ga-PSMA11 PET/MRI and PET/CT studies according to the 3 interpretation criteria. Two of them reevaluated all studies 6 mo later in the same manner and masked to the initial reading. The Gwet agreement coefficient was calculated to evaluate interreader, intrareader, and intercriteria agreement based on the following sites: local lesion (primary tumor or prostate bed after radical prostatectomy), lymph node metastases, and other metastases. Results: In the PET/MRI group, interreader, intrareader, and intercriteria agreement ranged from substantial to almost perfect for any site according to all 3 criteria. In the PET/CT group, interreader agreement ranged from substantial to almost perfect except for judgment of distant metastases based on the PSMA Reporting and Data System (Gwet agreement coefficient, 0.57; moderate agreement), in which the most frequent cause of disagreement was lung nodules. Intrareader agreement ranged from substantial to almost perfect for any site according to all 3 criteria. Intercriteria agreement for each site was also substantial to almost perfect. Conclusion: Although the 3 published criteria have good interreader and intrareader reproducibility in evaluating 68Ga-PSMA11 PET, there are some factors causing interreader disagreement. Further work is needed to address this issue.""","""['Akira Toriihara', 'Tomomi Nobashi', 'Lucia Baratto', 'Heying Duan', 'Farshad Moradi', 'Sonya Park', 'Negin Hatami', 'Carina Mari Aparici', 'Guido Davidzon', 'Andrei Iagaru']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""J Nucl Med""","""['Value of 68Ga-PSMA HBED-CC PET for the Assessment of Lymph Node Metastases in Prostate Cancer Patients with Biochemical Recurrence: Comparison with Histopathology After Salvage Lymphadenectomy.', 'Detection Threshold and Reproducibility of 68Ga-PSMA11 PET/CT in a Mouse Model of Prostate Cancer.', 'Comparison of 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT and multiparametric MRI for staging of high-risk prostate cancer68Ga-PSMA PET and MRI in prostate cancer.', 'Prostate-specific membrane antigen positron emission tomography in the management of recurrent prostate cancer.', '68GaGa-PSMA-11: The First FDA-Approved 68Ga-Radiopharmaceutical for PET Imaging of Prostate Cancer.', 'Modified PROMISE criteria for standardized interpretation of gastrin-releasing peptide receptor (GRPR)-targeted PET.', 'PET Criteria by Cancer Type from Imaging Interpretation to Treatment Response Assessment: Beyond FDG PET Score.', 'High Interobserver Agreement on PSMA PET/CT Even in the Absence of Clinical Data.', 'Prebiopsy 68Ga-PSMA PET imaging: can we improve the current diagnostic pathway for prostate cancer?', 'Comparison of Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging with Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen Positron-Emission Tomography Imaging in Primary Prostate Cancer Diagnosis: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.']"""

Methods: Sixteen patients with intermediate- or high-risk PCa underwent 18F-PSMA-1007 and 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT within 15 d. PET findings were compared between the 2 radiotracers and with reference-standard pathologic specimens obtained from radical prostatectomy. The Cohen κ-coefficient was used to assess the concordance between 18F-PSMA-1007 and 68Ga-PSMA-11 for detection of intraprostatic lesions. The McNemar test was used to assess agreement between intraprostatic PET/CT findings and histopathologic findings. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value were reported for each radiotracer. SUVmax was measured for all lesions, and tumor-to-background activity was calculated. Areas under receiver-operating-characteristic curves were calculated for discriminating diseased from nondiseased prostate segments, and optimal SUV cutoffs were calculated using the Youden index for each radiotracer. Results: PSMA-avid lesions in the prostate were identified in all 16 patients with an almost perfect concordance between the 2 tracers (κ ranged from 0.871 to 1). Aside from the dominant intraprostatic lesion, similarly detected by both radiotracers, a second less intense positive focus was detected in 4 patients only with 18F-PSMA-1007. Three of these secondary foci were confirmed as Gleason grade 3 lesions, whereas the fourth was shown on pathologic examination to represent chronic prostatitis. Conclusion: This pilot study showed that both 18F-PSMA-1007 and 68Ga-PSMA-11 identify all dominant prostatic lesions in patients with intermediate- or high-risk PCa at staging. 18F-PSMA-1007, however, may detect additional low-grade lesions of limited clinical relevance.""","""['Jonathan Kuten', 'Ibrahim Fahoum', 'Ziv Savin', 'Ofer Shamni', 'Gilad Gitstein', 'Dov Hershkovitz', 'Nicola J Mabjeesh', 'Ofer Yossepowitch', 'Eyal Mishani', 'Einat Even-Sapir']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""J Nucl Med""","""['More advantages in detecting bone and soft tissue metastases from prostate cancer using 18F-PSMA PET/CT.', 'Comparing the Staging/Restaging Performance of 68Ga-Labeled Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen and 18F-Choline PET/CT in Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.', '68Ga-PSMA PET/CT for Primary Lymph Node and Distant Metastasis NM Staging of High-Risk Prostate Cancer.', 'PET/CT With 68Ga-PSMA in Prostate Cancer: Radiopharmaceutical Background and Clinical Implications.', '68Ga-prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA) positron emission tomography (PET) for primary staging of high-risk prostate cancer: a systematic review.', 'Up-to-Date Imaging and Diagnostic Techniques for Prostate Cancer: A Literature Review.', 'Impact of non-regional lymph node metastases accurately revealed on 18F-PSMA-1007 PET/CT in the clinical management of metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer.', 'PET imaging of new target CDK19 in prostate cancer.', 'The Application of Radiolabeled Targeted Molecular Probes for the Diagnosis and Treatment of Prostate Cancer.', 'The prognostic value of 18F-PSMA-1007 PET/CT in predicting pathological upgrading of newly diagnosed prostate cancer from systematic biopsy to radical prostatectomy.']"""

Methods: Between January 2017 and March 2019, retrospectively, all consecutive patients with diagnosed intermediate- or high-risk primary PCa who underwent preoperative PSMA PET/CT (68Ga or 18F-DCFPyL) followed by robot-assisted radical prostatectomy and extended pelvic LN dissection (ePLND) were included. All patients without suspected LN metastases on PSMA PET/CT were considered candidates for SN biopsy with indocyanine green-99mTc-nanocolloid or 99mTc-nanocolloid with free indocyanine green used as tracers. The ePLND was used as a reference standard. Results: Of 53 patients, 22 had positive PSMA PET/CT results and 31 underwent subsequent SN biopsy after negative PSMA PET/CT results. In total, 23 patients (43%) were pN1, of whom 6 (26%) had negative PSMA PET/CT results and underwent subsequent SN biopsy. The combined use of SN biopsy and PSMA PET/CT identified all pN1 patients (100% sensitivity; 95% confidence interval, 86%-100%) and performed correct nodal staging in 50 of 53 patients (94% diagnostic accuracy; 95% confidence interval, 84%-99%).

Conclusion: Combining both modalities led to a 94% accuracy for nodal staging in diagnosed intermediate- and high-risk primary PCa. Adding SN biopsy in patients with negative PSMA PET/CT results increased the combined sensitivity to 100% for detecting nodal metastases at ePLND.

The purpose of this study is to conduct a statistical comparison of dose statistics for both walled and solid structure contours for both bladder and rectum in the treatment of intermediate risk prostate cancer with volumetric arc therapy (VMAT). Ten intermediate risk prostate cases were randomly selected. Rectum and bladder were first contoured as solid structures, and then the corresponding wall structures were generated using either a slice-by-slice cropping (2D method), or with a full 3D cropping tool (3D method). Each case was then inverse planned using a 2-arc VMAT technique. Two plans per case were created, 1 with a hypofractionated treatment and 1 with a standard fractionated treatment. DVHs were calculated for solid structure contours, and DWHs were calculated for the walled structure contours generated using 2D and 3D contouring tools. A nonparametric Spearman statistic correlation test was used to compare a large number of relevant dose histogram points, and to establish the relationship between dose statistics for walled and solid structures. Several notable relationships were observed. Maximum rectal dose was strongly correlated between the solid structure and both the 2D-generated (Spearman's correlation rs = 0.988, p < 0.01) and 3D-generated (rs = 0.952 p< 0.01) wall structures. This indicates that the rectal hot spot occurred in or near the wall for all cases, suggesting that both structure types give similar maximum dose information for rectum. Maximum bladder dose was not significantly correlated between solid structures and the 2D (rs = 0.596, p= 0.069) and 3D-generated (rs = 0.681, p= 0.03) counterparts. This suggests that the maximum dose is not consistently in or near the bladder wall. This favors the use of bladder wall contours when considering bladder toxicity, with the maximum dose to the wall potentially being more relevant radiobiologically.

Materials and methods:   Twenty-six male patients with peripheral zone prostate cancer (PCa) who had undergone 3T multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan prior to biopsy were included in the study and evaluated retrospectively. The GS was obtained by both standard 12-core transrectal ultrasound guided biopsy and targeted MRI-US fusion biopsy and then confirmed by prostatectomy, if available. For each confirmed tumour focus, DCE-derived quantitative perfusion metrics (Ktrans, Kep, Ve, initial area under the curve [AUC]), the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) value, and normalized versions of quantitative metrics were measured and correlated with the GS.  Results:   Ktrans had the highest diagnostic accuracy value of 82% among the DCE-MRI parameters (AUC 0.90), and ADC had the strongest diagnostic accuracy value of 87% among the overall parameters (AUC 0.92). The combination of ADC and Ktrans have higher diagnostic performance with the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve being 0.98 (sensitivity 0.94; specificity 0.89; accuracy 0.92) compared to the individual evaluation of each parameter alone.The GS showed strong negative correlations with ADC (r = -0.72) and normalized ADC (r = -0.69) as well as a significant positive correlation with Ktrans (r = 0.69).

However, follow up after FT is still challenging and is subject to current studies. Significance of imaging after FT such as multiparametric MRI (mpMRI) is currently not well established. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the efficacy of alternative imaging during the follow up of low risk PCa treated with focal HIFU therapy using CEUS and image fusion.  Materials and methods:   Retrospective single arm study in patients with uni- or bilateral, low or intermediate risk prostate cancer treated with HIFU at our institution between October 2016 and January 2018. CEUS in combination with image fusion using an axial T2-weighted MRI sequence was performed during follow up 3, 6, 9 and 12 months after the therapy.  Results:   4 consecutive patients with Gleason score (GS) 6 and 4 patients with GS 7a prostate cancer were included in the study. Hemiablation was performed in 7 patients with unilateral tumor. One patient underwent whole gland treatment due to histological proven bilateral PCa. Mean patient age at time of therapy was 70.3 (54-83) years and mean Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level prior treatment was 7.8 ng/ml (2.1-14.4), after 3 months mean PSA level was 3.9 ng/ml (0.1-7.2), after 6 months 3.5 ng/ml (0.2-6.0), after 9 months 3.1 ng/ml (0.2-6.8) and 3.3 ng/ml (0.2-6.1) after 12 months. CEUS showed no signs of microvascularisation after 3, 6, 9 and 12 months in the ablated zone. 3 months posttreatment the necrotic tissue was still visible in the B-mode scan, although with no signs of vascularization performing CEUS. After 6 months the ablated side of the prostate was almost completely atrophic. And after 9 months the necrotic tissue was completely resolved. Between 9 and 12 months no changes in microvascularisation and perfusion could be shown.

Prostate stem cell-like cancer cells isolated from human prostate cancer (PC) biopsies express CD44+/α2β1 hi/CD133+ cell surface markers and can self-renew in vitro. Expression of calcitonin (CT) and its receptor (CTR) is frequently elevated in PCs and activation of CT-CTR axis in non-invasive PC cells induces an invasive phenotype. We investigated whether CT-CTR autocrine axis induces stem cell-like phenotype in two PC cell lines. CT-CTR axis in these cell lines was activated by enforced expression of CTR. The cells were then examined for the changes in the expression of CD44 and CD133, collagen adherence, tumorigenic, metastatic and repopulating characteristics. The activation of CT-CTR axis led to a large increase in adherence to collagen and a remarkable increase of CD44 and CD133 in PC-3 and LNCaP cells. This was accompanied by a strong increase in tumorigenic, metastatic and repopulation properties of PC cells. However, the mutation of CTR-C PDZ-binding site in CTR almost abolished CTR-mediated increases in stem cell-like characteristics of PC cells. These results support an important role for CT-CTR axis in the progression of PC from localized cancer to an aggressive form, and a majority of proinvasive CTR actions may be mediated through its interaction with its partner protein at the PDZ-binding site. These results suggest that CT/CTR can serve as a valuable target to prevent the generation of stem-like PC cells.""","""['Afaf Aldahish', 'Ajay Kale', 'Ahmed Aljameeli', 'Girish V Shah']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Endocr Relat Cancer""","""['Calcitonin Receptor-Zonula Occludens-1 Interaction Is Critical for Calcitonin-Stimulated Prostate Cancer Metastasis.', 'A-kinase anchoring protein 2 is required for calcitonin-mediated invasion of cancer cells.', 'Calcitonin receptor increases invasion of prostate cancer cells by recruiting zonula occludens-1 and promoting PKA-mediated TJ disassembly.', 'Exploring the origins of the normal prostate and prostate cancer stem cell.', 'Animal models relevant to human prostate carcinogenesis underlining the critical implication of prostatic stem/progenitor cells.', 'The Molecular Biology of Prostate Cancer Stem Cells: From the Past to the Future.', 'Zinc finger protein‑like 1 is a novel neuroendocrine biomarker for prostate cancer.', 'Endocrine and paracrine characteristics of neuroendocrine prostate cancer.', 'Calcitonin: current concepts and differential diagnosis.', 'Tumor Microenvironment in Prostate Cancer: Toward Identification of Novel Molecular Biomarkers for Diagnosis, Prognosis, and Therapy Development.']"""

In our previous reports, a Crateva adansonii dichloromethane-methanol (DCM/MeOH) extract was shown to prevent chemically induced tumors in Wistar rats.  Aim of study:   To determine the bioactive principle of Crateva adansonii extract and to elucidate its underlying mechanism.  Materials and methods:   An activity-guided fractionation was realized using MTT assay. To investigate if the bioactive compound daucosterol (CA2) accounted for the previously observed anticancer effects of the C. adansonii extract, it was tested on cell growth, cell proliferation, cell cycle, cell death mechanism and cell migration. In addition, cell cycle- and apoptosis-regulating proteins were assessed by Western blotting.  Results:   Daucosterol (CA2), a steroid saponin, was identified as major anticancer principle of the C. adansonii extract. Daucosterol significantly inhibited LNCaP, DU145 and PC3 prostate carcinoma cell growth and proliferation at the optimal concentration of 1 μg/mL. It also significantly increased the number of late apoptotic (DU145) and apoptotic (PC3) cells. The number of cells in S phase increased in DU145, while the number of G0/G1 cells decreased. Cell cycle proteins (cdk1, pcdk1, cyclin A and B) were down-regulated in DU145 and PC3 cells, whereas only cdk2 was down-regulated in PC3 cells. Moreover, the anti-apoptotic Akt, pAKT and Bcl-2 proteins were down-regulated, while the pro-apoptotic protein Bax was up-regulated. CA2 induced anti-metastatic effects by decreasing chemotaxis and cell migration, while it increased cell adhesion to fibronectin and collagen matrix.

Overexpression of SOX4 has been shown to play important roles in multiple cancers including PCa. However, the link between these two critical genetic aberrations is unclear. In the current study, we showed that C-MYC was overexpressed in 16.2% (17/105) of Chinese patients with localized PCa. Overexpression of C-MYC was significantly associated with high Gleason scores (P = 0.012) and high Ki67 labeling index (P = 0.005). C-MYC overexpression was correlated with cancer-related mortality and suggested to be an unfavorable prognostic factor in Chinese PCa patients (P = 0.018). Overexpression of C-MYC is associated with SOX4 overexpression in PCa tissues. Notably, SOX4 is a direct target gene of C-MYC; C-MYC activates SOX4 expression via binding to its promoter. In addition, Co-IP analysis demonstrated a physical interaction between C-MYC and SOX4 protein in PCa cells. Clinically, C-MYC+/SOX4+ characterized poor prognosis in a subset of PCa patients. In total, C-MYC overexpression may contribute to PCa progression by activating SOX4.

We report on long-term outcomes stratified by metastatic burden for M1 patients.  Methods:   We randomly allocated patients in 2 : 1 ratio to standard-of-care (SOC; control group) or SOC + docetaxel. Metastatic disease burden was categorised using retrospectively-collected baseline staging scans where available. Analysis used Cox regression models, adjusted for stratification factors, with emphasis on restricted mean survival time where hazards were non-proportional.  Results:   Between 05 October 2005 and 31 March 2013, 1086 M1 patients were randomised to receive SOC (n = 724) or SOC + docetaxel (n = 362). Metastatic burden was assessable for 830/1086 (76%) patients; 362 (44%) had low and 468 (56%) high metastatic burden. Median follow-up was 78.2 months. There were 494 deaths on SOC (41% more than the previous report). There was good evidence of benefit of docetaxel over SOC on OS (HR = 0.81, 95% CI 0.69-0.95, P = 0.009) with no evidence of heterogeneity of docetaxel effect between metastatic burden sub-groups (interaction P = 0.827). Analysis of other outcomes found evidence of benefit for docetaxel over SOC in failure-free survival (HR = 0.66, 95% CI 0.57-0.76, P < 0.001) and progression-free survival (HR = 0.69, 95% CI 0.59-0.81, P < 0.001) with no evidence of heterogeneity of docetaxel effect between metastatic burden sub-groups (interaction P > 0.5 in each case).

Methods:   One thousand two hundred and seven patients with nmCRPC were randomized 2 : 1 to apalutamide (240 mg daily) or placebo. The primary end point of the study was MFS. Subsequent therapy for metastatic CRPC was permitted. When the primary end point was met, the study was unblinded. Patients receiving placebo who had not yet developed metastases were offered open-label apalutamide. At IA2, pre-specified analysis of OS was undertaken, using a group-sequential testing procedure with O'Brien-Fleming-type alpha spending function. Safety and second progression-free survival (PFS2) were assessed.  Results:   Median follow-up was 41 months.

Although most PCs grow slowly, it is unclear whether a longer time interval from diagnosis to treatment causes worse outcomes. This study aimed to investigate whether the time interval from diagnosis to radical prostatectomy (RP) in men with clinically localized PC affects postoperative oncologic outcomes.  Methods:   We retrospectively analyzed data of 427 men who underwent RP for localized PC between January 2005 and June 2016. The patients were divided into two groups based on the cutoff median time interval (100 days) from biopsy to surgery. The associations between time interval from biopsy to surgery (< 100 vs. ≥ 100 days) and adverse pathologic outcomes such as positive surgical margin, pathologic upgrading, and upstaging were evaluated. Biochemical recurrence (BCR)-free survival rates were analyzed and compared based on the time interval from biopsy to surgery.  Results:   Pathologic upgrading of Gleason score in surgical specimens was more frequent in the longer time interval group and showed marginal significance (38.8% vs. 30.0%; P = 0.057). Based on multivariable analysis, an association was observed between time interval from biopsy to surgery and pathologic upgrading (odds ratio, 2.211; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.342-3.645; P = 0.002). BCR-free survival did not differ based on time interval from biopsy to surgery, and significant association was not observed between time interval from biopsy to surgery and BCR on multivariable analysis (hazard ratio, 1.285; 95% CI, 0.795-2.077; P = 0.305).

PCa harboring SPOP hotspot mutants (e.g., F133V) are resistant to BET inhibitors because of aberrant elevation of BET proteins. Here, we identified a previously unrecognized mutation Q165P at the edge of SPOP MATH domain in primary and metastatic PCa of a patient. The Q165P mutation causes structural changes in the MATH domain and impairs SPOP dimerization and substrate degradation. Different from F133V hotspot mutant tumors, Q165P mutant patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) and organoids were modestly sensitive to the BET inhibitor JQ1. Accordingly, protein levels of AR, BRD4 and downstream effectors such as RAC1 and phosphorylated AKT were not robustly elevated in Q165P mutant cells as in F133V mutant cells. However, NEO2734, a novel dual inhibitor of BET and CBP/p300, is active in both hotspot mutant (F133V) and non-hotspot mutant (Q165P) PCa cells in vitro and in vivo.

The aim of this retrospective study was to evaluate the oncological outcome and pattern of recurrence in patients treated with stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) to lymph node metastases.  Methods:   In this multi-institutional analysis, patients with a maximum of five lymph node metastases from PCa treated with SBRT were included. Primary endpoints of the analysis were local control (LC), out-of-field nodal progression-free survival (NPFS), overall progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS).  Results:   109 patients and 155 lymph node metastases were evaluated. Patients' median age was 70.8 years (range 51-84) and median PSA before SBRT was 1.88 ng/ml (range 0.3-45.5 ng/ml). The dose delivered to the target ranged from 25 to 48 Gy in 4-7 fractions; median BED1.5 Gy was 198 Gy (range 108.3-432 Gy). With a median follow-up of 16 months, LC rates at 1 and 3 years were 93% and 86%, respectively. In-field progression of disease was observed in 11 (7%) lesions. One- and 3‑year NPFS was 59% and 29%, and median NPFS was 15 months. Rates of OS at 1 and 3 years were 100% and 95%. The median time to administration of a systemic treatment after SBRT was 7.8 months (1.7-54.8).

An ongoing challenge for such patients is developing optimal strategies and biomarkers capable of differentiating between men at risk of early recurrence (<3 years) that will benefit from adjuvant therapies and men at risk of late recurrence (>5 years) who will benefit from long-term monitoring and/or salvage therapies.  Patients and methods:   DNA methylation changes for 12 genes associated with disease progression were analyzed in 453 prostate tumors. A 4-gene prognostic model (4-G model) for biochemical recurrence (BCR) was derived utilizing LASSO from Cohort 1 (n = 254) and validated in Cohort 2 (n = 199). Subsequently, the 4-G model was evaluated for its association with salvage radiotherapy (RT) and/or hormone therapy, and the additive potential to CAPRA-S to develop an integrative gene model was assessed.  Results:   The 4-G model was significantly associated with BCR in both cohorts (chi-squared analysis P≤ 0.004) and specifically, with late recurrence at 5+ years (P < 0.001, Cohort 1; P= 0.028, Cohort 2). Multivariable Cox proportional regression analysis identified the 4-G model as significantly associated with salvage RT or hormone therapy in Cohort 1 (hazard ratio (HR) 1.64, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.29-2.10, P< 0.001) and further validated in Cohort 2 (HR 1.63, 95% CI 1.18-2.25, P< 0.001). The integrative model outperformed prostate-specific antigen and the 4-G model alone for predicting BCR and was associated with patients who received hormone therapy 3+ years postsurgery.
