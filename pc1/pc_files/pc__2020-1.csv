Methods:   322 887 adult patients undergoing an initial course of cancer-directed therapy for breast, colorectal, lung, or prostate cancer from 2008 to 2014 were drawn from a large commercial claims database. We defined 16 oncology-specific triggers using diagnosis and procedure codes. To distinguish treatment-related complications from comorbidities, we required a logical and temporal relationship between a treatment and the associated trigger. We tabulated the prevalence of triggers by cancer type and metastatic status during 1-year of follow-up, and examined cancer trigger risk factors.  Results:   Cancer-specific trigger events affected 19% of patients over the initial treatment year. The trigger burden varied by disease and metastatic status, from 6% of patients with nonmetastatic prostate cancer to 41% and 50% of those with metastatic colorectal and lung cancers, respectively. The most prevalent triggers were abnormal serum bicarbonate, blood transfusion, non-contrast chest CT scan following radiation therapy, and hypoxemia. Among patients with metastatic disease, 10% had one trigger event and 29% had two or more. Triggers were more common among older patients, women, non-whites, patients with low family incomes, and those without a college education.  Conclusions:   Oncology-specific triggers offer a promising method for identifying potential patient safety events among patients across cancer care settings.""","""['Saul N Weingart', 'Jason Nelson', 'Benjamin Koethe', 'Omar Yaghi', 'Stephan Dunning', 'Albert Feldman', 'David M Kent', 'Allison Lipitz-Snyderman']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Cancer Med""","""['Association between cancer-specific adverse event triggers and mortality: A validation study.', 'Performance of a Trigger Tool for Identifying Adverse Events in Oncology.', 'Evaluating iatrogenic prescribing: development of an oncology-focused trigger tool.', 'Proposal of a trigger tool to assess adverse events in dental care.', 'Pharmacovigilance in oncology.', ""Improving infectious adverse event reporting for children and adolescents enrolled in clinical trials for acute lymphoblastic leukemia: A report from the Children's Oncology Group."", 'A Risk-Factor Model for Antineoplastic Drug-Induced Serious Adverse Events in Cancer Inpatients: A Retrospective Study Based on the Global Trigger Tool and Machine Learning.', 'Chronic-pharma: New Platform for Chronic Patients Pharmacotherapy Optimization.', 'Evolution of Hematology Clinical Trial Adverse Event Reporting to Improve Care Delivery.', 'Describing adverse events in Swiss hospitalized oncology patients using the Global Trigger Tool.']"""

Assessing their longitudinal changes may implicate mechanisms of progression, treatment resistance, and suggest new therapeutic targets.  Methods:   Thirty-seven men with biochemically recurrent (BCR) prostate cancer who received 6 months of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) and were monitored until the time to prostate-specific antigen progression (TTPP) were identified from a completed phase III trial (NCT00020085). Serum samples were archived at baseline, 3 months after ADT, and at TTPP. Cytokine concentrations were quantified using a 36-parameter electrochemiluminescence assay. The Wilcoxon signed-rank sum test was used to compare observations between time points. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to calculate TTPP dichotomized by cytokine values above or below the median. Pearson's rank correlation coefficient was used to compare continuous variables.  Results:   Median TTPP was 399 days (range, 114-1641). Median prostate-specific antigen (PSA) at baseline and progression were 8.5 and 5.3 ng/mL, respectively. Twenty-three patients (62%) achieved undetectable PSA with ADT. Castrate levels of testosterone (<50 ng/dL) after 3 months of ADT occurred in 35 patients (95%). TNF-α (P = .002), IL-23 (P = .002), and CXCL10 (P = .001) significantly increased from baseline to post ADT. Certain cytokines correlated longitudinally: TNF-α correlated with IL-23 (r = .72; P < .001) and IL-8 (r = .59; P < .001) from baseline to post ADT and to PSA progression. Neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio correlated with IL-27 (r = .57; P < .001) and MIP-3α (r = .56; P < .001). Patients with a detectable PSA after ADT had elevated levels of IL-6 (P = .049) and IL-8 (P = .013) at PSA progression as compared with those with an undetectable PSA. There was a trend toward shorter TTPP in patients with TNF-α levels above the median (P = .042).

Age-specific incidence rates (ASIRs) by modern clinical risk groups could inform risk stratification efforts for screening.  Methods:   This cross-sectional population study identified all men diagnosed with PCa in Norway from 2014 to 2017 (n = 20,356). Age, Gleason score (primary plus secondary), and clinical stage were extracted. Patients were assigned to clinical risk groups: low, favorable intermediate, unfavorable intermediate, high, regional, and metastatic. Chi-square tests analyzed the independence of Gleason scores and modern PCa risk groups with age. ASIRs for each risk group were calculated as the product of Norwegian ASIRs for all PCa and the proportions observed for each risk category.  Results:   Older age was significantly associated with a higher Gleason score and more advanced disease. The percentages of men with Gleason 8 to 10 disease among men aged 55 to 59, 65 to 69, 75 to 79, and 85 to 89 years were 16.5%, 23.4%, 37.2%, and 59.9%, respectively (P < .001); the percentages of men in the same age groups with at least high-risk disease were 29.3%, 39.1%, 60.4%, and 90.6%, respectively (P < .001). The maximum ASIRs (per 100,000 men) for low-risk, favorable intermediate-risk, unfavorable intermediate-risk, high-risk, regional, and metastatic disease were 157.1 for those aged 65 to 69 years, 183.8 for those aged 65 to 69 years, 194.8 for those aged 70 to 74 years, 408.3 for those aged 75 to 79 years, 159.7 for those aged ≥85 years, and 314.0 for those aged ≥85 years, respectively. At the ages of 75 to 79 years, the ASIR of high-risk disease was approximately 6 times greater than the ASIR at 55 to 59 years.

Methods:   A total of 85 patients with prostate cancer underwent 3 T multiparametric MRI, followed by radical prostatectomy. Histogram parameters of the tumor from the SEM [distributed diffusion coefficient (DDC) and α] and the monoexponential model [MEM; apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC)] were evaluated. The associations between parameters and Gleason score or Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System v. 2 were evaluated. The area under the receiver operating characteristics curve was calculated to evaluate diagnostic performance of parameters in predicting CSC.  Results:   The values of histogram parameters of DDC and ADC were significantly lower in patients with CSC than in patients without CSC (p < 0.05), except for skewness and kurtosis. The value of the 25th percentile of α was significantly lower in patients with CSC than in patients without CSC (p = 0.014). Histogram parameters of ADC and DDC had significant weak to moderate negative associations with Gleason score or Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System v. 2 (p < 0.001), except for skewness and kurtosis. For predicting CSC, the area under the curves of mean ADC (0.856), 50th percentile DDC (0.852), and 25th percentile α (0.707) yielded the highest values compared to other histogram parameters from each group.

Lymph nodes in the fossa of Marcille, which is an important pelvic lymphatic pathway and candidate for additional dissection, have not been evaluated at the molecular level. Here, we assessed by molecular analysis the presence of occult positive lymph nodes in the fossa of Marcille in patients with clinically localized high-risk prostate cancer.  Methods:   Fifty-two patients with clinically localized high-risk prostate cancer underwent pelvic lymph node dissection accompanied by robot-assisted radical prostatectomy. All nodal packets were dissected separately and grouped into right and left obturator, external and internal iliac regions (including common iliac region to ureter crossing), and fossa of Marcille. All lymph nodes were bisected and evaluated by histopathological or molecular analysis using a quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. The number of positive lymph nodes in the fossa of Marcille and the difference in detection rate were investigated using histopathological and molecular analyses. Perioperative complication rate and predictive factors for biochemical recurrence were evaluated.  Results:   In the molecular analysis, there were seven positive lymph nodes in the fossa of Marcille in three patients, which were coexistent with positive nodes in other regions. The detection rate of positive lymph nodes was significantly higher using molecular than histopathological analysis (P < .01). Perioperative complication rate within 90 days after the operation was 25.0% and no Clavien-Dindo grade ≥3 complication was confirmed. Detection of metastasis by histopathological and molecular analysis was a significant factor related to biochemical recurrence in the Cox proportional hazards regression model.

A PRECISE score of 1 or 2 denotes radiological regression, PRECISE 3 indicates stability and PRECISE 4 or 5 implies progression. We evaluated the inter-reader reproducibility of different apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) calculations and their relationship to the PRECISE score.  Material and methods:   Baseline and follow-up scans (on the same MR systems) of 30 patients with visible lesions from two different institutions (University College London and Sapienza University of Rome) were analysed by two radiologists (one from each site). The PRECISE score was initially assessed in consensus. At least six weeks later, to reduce the likelihood of being influenced by the consensus PRECISE reading, each radiologist independently calculated ADC for the following: lesion, non-cancerous tissue and urine in the bladder. Normalised ADC ratios were calculated with respect to normal prostatic tissue (npADC) and urine. Spearman's correlation (ρ), intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC), differences in ADC and ROC curves were computed.  Results:   Interobserver reproducibility was very good (ρ > 0.8; ICC > 0.90). Lesion ADC (0.91 vs 0.73 × 10-3 mm2/s; p=0.025) and npADC ratio (0.68 vs 0.53; p=0.012) at follow-up mpMRI were different between patients with radiological regression or stability vs progression. Cut-offs of 0.77 × 10-3 mm2/s (lesion ADC) and 0.59 (npADC ratio) could differentiate the two groups (area under the curve: 0.74 and 0.77, respectively).

Materials and methods:   This IRB-approved study enrolled 55 subjects. The initial 5 subjects were studied for SHI optimization, while the remaining 50 were evaluated with contrast-enhanced sonography using continuous SHI, color, and power Doppler as well as conventional grayscale, continuous color, and power Doppler and SHI combined with maximum flash replenishment. A maximum of 6 directed biopsy cores were obtained from sites of greatest asymmetrical enhancement, followed by spatially distributed cores in a double sextant distribution. Subharmonic time-intensity parameters, including time to peak intensity, peak intensity, and estimated perfusion were also evaluated for each directed biopsy core. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis and conditional logistic regression were employed to assess the benefit of each modality and the quantitative SHI parameters.  Results:   Cancer was detected in 22 of 50 subjects. Among subjects with clinically significant CaP (n = 11), targeted cores were more likely to be positive (odds ratio 1.39, P = .02).

Materials and methods:   From a prospective database, we included all prebiopsy MRI-positive men fulfilling AS criteria at diagnosis (Toronto [n = 114], UCSF [n = 82], or PRIAS [n = 60] criteria) on SB. All patients underwent a combination of SB and software-based fusion TB, and an immediate radical prostatectomy. The primary endpoints were the pathologic upgrading and upstaging rates.  Results:   Biopsy grade group was upgraded to grade group (GG) 2 and to GG≥3 on TB in 65.9%-76.7% and in 12.2-16.7%, respectively. The rate of GG ≥3 in radical prostatectomy specimens varied from 31.6% to 43.3% with no relation between strictest criteria and lower upgrading rates. The proportion of not organ-confined disease (35%-39%) was comparable among the AS cohorts. Negative TB was strongly associated with the absence of final GG ≥3. Tumor grade on TB was significantly correlated with the risk of final GG ≥3 in both Toronto and UCSF cohorts, not in the PRIAS cohort. In the PRIAS cohort, the only independent predictive factor for GG ≥3 disease was the maximal tumor length in any core (P = .034).  Conclusion:   In MRI-positive patients, the risk of disease reclassification was comparable whatever the SB-based AS criteria used.

We aimed to identify which oxidative stress markers, specifically lipid and global oxidation and glycation, are associated with PCa progression.  Patients and methods:   We recruited 3 groups of patients from a urologic clinic at the University of Cincinnati Medical Center: men with PCa who had undergone prostatectomy, men with PCa under watchful waiting, and men with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). We used the most commonly used lipid oxidation marker, F2-isoprostanes; global oxidation markers, fluorescent oxidation products (FlOPs); and the commonly used marker for advanced glycation end products, carboxymethyllysine. These biomarkers were measured in plasma samples at baseline entry. Plasma prostate-specific antigen (PSA) was measured at enrollment and follow-up visits.  Results:   Compared with men with BPH, men with PCa who had undergone prostatectomy had 26% (P = .01) higher levels of F2-isoprostanes and 20% (P = .08) higher levels of carboxymethyllysine. All the oxidation markers were similar when comparing men under watchful waiting with men with BPH. When examining the associations between baseline oxidation markers and follow-up PSAs, we found that different oxidation markers had differential patterns associated with PSA elevation. F2-isoprostanes were positively associated with PSA elevation among men with PCa; FlOP_320 was positively associated with PSA elevation among both men with PCa and men with BPH, whereas among men with PCa under watchful waiting, FlOP_360 and FlOP_400 had opposite trends of associations with PSA elevation.  Conclusions:   Our study suggested that high levels of lipid oxidation were associated with PCa progression, whereas different global oxidation markers had different patterns associated with PCa progression. Large-scale clinical studies are needed to confirm our associations. Our study provides a comprehensive view of the relationship between biomarkers and PCa progression.""","""['Tianying Wu', 'Susan Kasper', 'Ronnie Meiyi Wong', 'Bruce Bracken']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Clin Genitourin Cancer""","""['Impact of Oxidative Stress Biomarkers and Carboxymethyllysine (an Advanced Glycation End Product) on Prostate Cancer: A Prospective Study.', 'Additional value of the ratio of serum total testosterone to total prostate-specific antigen in the diagnosis of prostate cancer in a Chinese population.', 'Diagnosis of Prostate Cancer in Patients with Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA) in the Gray Area: Construction of 2 Predictive Models.', 'Management of localised prostate cancer: watchful waiting, surgery or radiation therapy, depending on the natural course, which is often relatively slow.', 'EAU guidelines on prostate cancer.

ORP and PLND are associated with relevant postoperative morbidity. The CCI-ranging from 0 (no complications) to 100 (death)-is a tool that aims to integrate all complications occuring within 90 days postoperatively weighted by severity in a single formula.  Methods:   In an observational single-center cohort, 90-day postoperative complications of 1,123 consecutive patients undergoing standardized ORP and PLND between 1996 and 2017 were evaluated. Prospectively collected complications were graded according to the Clavien-Dindo Classification. Grade I to II complications were defined as minor and grade IIIa to V as major. Finally, the recently developed modified Bern CCI using an exponential function, which transforms the sum of the weights into a value between 0 and 100 and the original CCI for each patient were extracted and compared. The correlation between the modified Bern and original CCI values was depicted graphically.  Results:   The complication rate was 42%, with 18% minor and 24% major complications. With the original CCI, the threshold of 100 was exceeded in 1 patient who had a maximal index value of 101 within 90d postoperatively. The maximal value of the Bern CCI was 97.5. Mean Bern and original CCI scores and standard deviations were 6.2 (11.3) and 7.6 (12.2) at 30 days, and 9.3 (13.9) and 10.7 (14.2) at 90 days.  Conclusions:   The Bern CCI provides a more precise depiction of postoperative morbidity and represents the burden in patients with >1 complication after ORP and PLND more accurately than the original CCI allowing for a more reliable evaluation of quality of care and recovery.

Aims and objectives:   The purpose of the study is to look at the benefit of administration of an oral prebiotic amylase resistant starch in reducing the incidence of acute radiation proctitis, a distressing symptom in patients receiving radiation therapy for cancer of the cervix.  Material and methods:   The study was conducted between 2011 and 2014 in 104 patients receiving radical chemo-radiotherapy for carcinoma cervix. Patients were randomized in to two arms, one receiving 30 gm of resistant starch and the other digestible starch on a daily basis throughout the course of the external radiotherapy. All patients received standard 4-field box radiation portals, 50 Gy in 25 fractions with 4 cycles of weekly concurrent Cisplatin. At completion of external beam radiotherapy, all patients underwent LDR/HDR brachytherapy. The study was double blinded and allocation was concealed from the investigators. The investigator recorded the radiotherapy related toxicity of the patients according to CTC V 3.0. The incidence and severity of grade 2-4 diarrhoea and proctitis were documented on a weekly basis and compared across the two groups and analyzed. Stool short chain fatty acid concentrations were measured at baseline at 2nd and 4th week and after 6 weeks of completion of radiotherapy in both study placebo arms and reported. The pattern of microbiota in the stool were also estimated in all patients at 4 time points. Two patients who progressed during therapy were not included in the analyses and two patients discontinued the intervention. A per protocol analyses was done.  Results:   At analysis there were 50 patients in each arm. The severity of clinical proctitis was found to be similar in both groups of patients with 12.2 % of patients experiencing toxicity of grade 2 and above in digestible starch group versus 14.6% in the resistant starch group. Functional proctitis was similarly graded and it was found that 16.3 % patients in digestible starch group experienced toxicity against 10.2 % patients in the resistant starch group. This difference was seen at 4th week and continued in the subsequent weeks till the end of radiation. Both groups had similar reported toxicity at 6 weeks post intervention and similar incidence of grade 2 and above diarrhea. The resistant starch group was found to have 8% incidence as compared to 2% in the other group at the 5th and 6th week. The short chain fatty acid concentrations were not significantly different in the groups at any point.  Conclusion:   The study did not demonstrate a significant benefit in administering resistant starch over and above normal diet to patients receiving pelvic radiotherapy. The reasons may be attributed to concurrent use of chemotherapy and decrease in intestinal probiotics. The use of digestible starch in the control arm may have contributed to lower incidence of the toxicity endpoints as well.""","""['Balu Krishna Sasidharan', 'Balamurugan Ramadass', 'P N Viswanathan', 'Prasanna Samuel', 'Mahasampath Gowri', 'Srinivasan Pugazhendhi', 'Balakrishnan S Ramakrishna']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""J Cancer Res Ther""","""['Sodium butyrate enemas in the treatment of acute radiation-induced proctitis in patients with prostate cancer and the impact on late proctitis.

Results revealed an increase of PART1, but a decrease of miR-150-5p in 56 colorectal cancer tissues. And there was a strong negative correlation between levels of PART1 and miR-150-5p in these cancer samples. Also, compared with 10 healthy controls, the level of PART1 was increased, whereas miR-150-5p expression was diminished in the serum of 10 colorectal cancer patients. Cell proliferation and migration, along with epithelial-mesenchymal transition, was promoted by PART1 overexpression. However, this lncRNA mitigated apoptosis of colorectal cancer cells. Whereas miR-150-5p mimic abrogated these effects caused by PART1 overexpression. The influences of PART1 knockdown on the above malignant characteristics of colorectal cancer cells were contrary to its overexpression. miR-150-5p inhibitor ablated the effects induced by PART1 knockdown. In xenograft mouse models, silencing of PART1 decreased tumor volume and weight. Our data supported that lncRNA PART1 may regulate leucine-rich α-2-glycoprotein-1 (LRG1) expression through a competing interaction mechanism that hindering miR-150-5p function.

This study sought to establish the efficacy of a tablet-delivered, group-based psychosocial intervention for improving HRQOL and reducing symptom burden in men with APC. We hypothesized that men randomized to cognitive-behavioral stress management (CBSM) would report improved HRQOL and reduced symptom burden relative to men randomized to an active control health promotion (HP) condition. Condition effects on intervention targets and moderators of these effects were explored.  Methods:   Men with APC (N = 192) were randomized (1:1) to 10-week tablet-delivered CBSM or HP, and followed for 1 year. Multilevel modeling was used to evaluate condition effects over time.  Results:   Changes in HRQOL and symptom burden did not differ between groups. Men in both groups improved across several intervention targets; men in the CBSM condition reported greater increases in self-reported ability to relax, and both conditions showed improvements in cancer-related anxiety, cancer-related distress, and feelings of cohesiveness with other patients over time. Moderating factors included baseline interpersonal disruption, fatigue, and sexual functioning.  Conclusions:   Tablet-delivered CBSM and HP were well received by men with APC. The hypothesized effects of CBSM on HRQOL and symptom burden were not supported, though improvements in intervention targets were observed across conditions. Participants reported high-baseline HRQOL relative to cancer and general population norms, possibly limiting intervention effects.

Methods:   Analysis of cohort patients ≥ 75 years, included between 2009 and 2017, who underwent a comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA). Variables of interest were history of T2D and VC, tumor site and metastatic status, CGA including eight domains (social environment, functional status, mobility, nutrition, mood, cognition, polypharmacy and comorbidities) and frailty.  Results:   Among 1092 patients (47% female, mean age 82 ± 5 years), 219 (20%) had a reported diagnosis of T2D at baseline including 152 (69%) with VC. The most common tumor sites were prostate (15%), breast (15%), skin (12%), and colorectum (11%); 29% of patients had a metastatic disease. Frailty was highly prevalent (84%). During follow-up (median of 15.3 months), 653 (60%) patients died (60% no T2D, 43% T2D without VC, 66% with VC). After adjustment for age, gender and metastatic status, diabetics with VC had a higher risk of all-cause death (aHR1.89, 1.24-2.86, p = 0.004).

The first iu-ma compares the performance of the MRI-stratified pathway and the systematic transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsy pathway for the detection of clinically significant prostate cancer, while the second iu-ma focuses on the use of biparametric versus multiparametric MRI for the diagnosis of prostate cancer. Our iu-mas allow for the effortless addition of new studies and data, thereby enabling physicians to keep track of the most recent scientific developments without having to resort to classical static meta-analyses that may become outdated in a short period of time. Furthermore, the iu-mas enable in-depth subgroup analyses by a wide variety of selectable parameters. Such an analysis is not only tailored to the needs of the reader but is also far more comprehensive than a classical meta-analysis. In that respect, following multiple subgroup analyses, we found that even for various subgroups, detection rates of prostate cancer are not different between biparametric and multiparametric MRI. Secondly, we could confirm the favorable influence of MRI biopsy stratification for multiple clinical scenarios. For the future, we envisage the use of this technology in addressing further clinical questions of other organ systems.""","""['Anton S Becker', 'Julian Kirchner', 'Thomas Sartoretti', 'Soleen Ghafoor', 'Sungmin Woo', 'Chong Hyun Suh', 'Joseph P Erinjeri', 'Hedvig Hricak', 'H Alberto Vargas']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""J Digit Imaging""","""['Comparison of Magnetic Resonance Imaging-stratified Clinical Pathways and Systematic Transrectal Ultrasound-guided Biopsy Pathway for the Detection of Clinically Significant Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials.', 'Magnetic resonance imaging-targeted biopsy may enhance the diagnostic accuracy of significant prostate cancer detection compared to standard transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsy: a systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Comparison of Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Targeted Biopsy With Systematic Biopsy Alone for the Diagnosis of Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.', 'Prostate Magnetic Resonance Imaging, with or Without Magnetic Resonance Imaging-targeted Biopsy, and Systematic Biopsy for Detecting Prostate Cancer: A Cochrane Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.', 'Magnetic resonance imaging in prostate cancer detection and management: a systematic review.', 'Taking PI-QUAL beyond the prostate: Towards a standardized radiological image quality score (RI-QUAL).', 'Amide Proton Transfer-weighted MRI combined with serum prostate-specific antigen levels for differentiating malignant prostate lesions from benign prostate lesions: a retrospective cohort study.', 'A narrative review of biparametric MRI (bpMRI) implementation on screening, detection, and the overall accuracy for prostate cancer.', 'Dynamic meta-analysis: a method of using global evidence for local decision making.', 'Biparametric (bp) and multiparametric (mp) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) approach to prostate cancer disease: a narrative review of current debate on dynamic contrast enhancement.']"""

We sought to measure compliance in non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) survivors and identify any differences based on patient, disease, and treatment characteristics.  Methods:   Eligible NHL survivors were identified from the Molecular Epidemiology Resource (MER) prospective cohort study. Survivors self-reported colorectal, breast, and prostate cancer screening and influenza immunization in a questionnaire 3 years post-diagnosis (FU3). The USPSTF guidelines were used to define compliance. Chi-square tests were used to compare characteristics of compliant versus non-compliant survivors.  Results:   A total of 1833 MER participants from 2005 to 2012 completed a FU3. Rates of breast and prostate cancer screening were 96% and 72%, respectively. No differences in compliance based on patient or disease characteristics or treatment were observed. Ninety-two percent of survivors were compliant with colorectal cancer screening. Older age, indolent lymphoma histology, and 2008-2012 year of diagnosis were associated with higher compliance. Eighty-two percent of survivors were compliant with influenza vaccination and older age was associated with higher compliance.  Conclusion:   NHL survivors have high compliance with USPSTF recommendations for cancer screening and immunization. Survivors who are younger or have aggressive lymphomas are less likely to meet the colorectal cancer screening guidelines. Older survivors are more likely to receive influenza vaccination.  Implications for cancer survivors:   Measures to further improve preventive care for NHL survivors, especially those younger in age, are necessary.""","""['Priyanka A Pophali', 'Melissa C Larson', 'Cristine Allmer', 'Umar Farooq', 'Brian K Link', 'Matthew J Maurer', 'James R Cerhan', 'Carrie A Thompson']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""J Cancer Surviv""","""['Health-Related Quality of Life in Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma Survivors: A Prospective Cohort Study.', 'Fatigue level changes with time in long-term Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin lymphoma survivors: a joint EORTC-LYSA cross-sectional study.', 'Measuring the impact of cancer: a comparison of non-Hodgkin lymphoma and breast cancer survivors.', 'Neurocognitive, psychosocial, and quality-of-life outcomes in adult survivors of childhood non-Hodgkin lymphoma.', 'Long-term survivors of childhood, adolescent and young adult non-Hodgkin lymphoma.', 'Preventive health care in blood cancer survivors: results from the ABC study.', 'Using the Precision Lasso for gene selection in diffuse large B cell lymphoma cancer.', ""Patient-reported patterns of follow-up care in the 'Aftercare in Blood Cancer Survivors' (ABC) study.""]"""

However, the incidence of castration-resistant PCa (CRPC) and PCa-specific mortality in patients with biochemical recurrence (BCR) after RP remains unclear. The aim of this study was to evaluate the cancer-specific survival (CSS) in patients with CRPC after RP, in particular those who had metastases or not.  Methods:   We retrospectively reviewed the data of 1582 consecutive patients who underwent RP between July 1996 and January 2019. The enrolled patients had histologically confirmed stage T1a-T3b PCa without lymph node involvement or distant metastasis. The endpoints were oncological outcomes, including CSS and BCR, in patients with PCa with or without metastases at the time of diagnosis with CRPC.  Results:   A total of 1474 patients were enrolled in this study. By the end of the follow-up period, 352 patients (24.6%) in the enrolled patients had BCR after RP. A total of 42 patients (2.9%) developed CRPC and 18 (1.3%) had died of PCa. With regard to metastasis in patients who diagnosed CRPC, the 5-year CSS rate was 100% for nonmetastatic CRPC (nmCRPC) patients and 53.8% for metastatic CRPC (mCRPC) patients after RP. The 5-year CSS rate was 100% for nmCRPC patients and 27.1% for mCRPC patients after the diagnosis with CRPC.  Conclusions:   CRPC is one of the lethal causes with PCa death.

Previous studies have shown that the expression of PSMA is not specific to prostate tissue. In this study we examine the expression of PSMA in urothelial cell carcinoma (UCC).  Methods:   Immunhistochemical PSMA-staining was performed in 89 UCC samples. PSMA expression in tumor tissue, adjacent healthy tissue and blood vessels was examined. We furthermore analyzed PSMA-mRNA expression in nine human UCC cell lines. We correlated our findings with clinical data regarding recurrence and progression of UCC.  Results:   UCC tissue showed a significantly higher PSMA expression compared to healthy urothelial tissue (p < 0.001). Non muscle invasive bladder cancer revealed significantly higher PSMA expression compared to muscle invasive bladder cancer (p < 0.05). PSMA expression significantly differed between various T-stages (p < 0.05) and tumor differentiation (p < 0.001). In four human UCC cell lines PSMA-mRNA was detectable. Those patients who suffered recurrence showed a higher rate of PSMA expression but no correlation to recurrence-free survival was evident. Progression of disease correlated significantly with a higher PSMA expression (p = 0.036).  Conclusions:   Both UCC tissue and healthy urothelial tissue express PSMA, with significantly higher levels in UCC. We confirmed these findings in human UCC cell lines. In this small first cohort expression of PSMA correlates significant with progression of disease but not with recurrence and recurrence-free survival. These first results make PSMA a promising target for future diagnosis and therapy of UCC.""","""['Henner Schreiber', 'Jörg Hänze', 'Wilhelm Nimphius', 'Frederik Anton Verburg', 'Markus Luster', 'Rainer Hofmann', 'Axel Hegele']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""J Cancer Res Clin Oncol""","""['Immunohistochemical expression of prostatic antigens in adenocarcinoma and villous adenoma of the urinary bladder.', 'CIP2A is a predictor of survival and a novel therapeutic target in bladder urothelial cell carcinoma.', 'Folate hydrolase (prostate-specific membrane corrected antigen) 1 expression in bladder cancer subtypes and associated tumor neovasculature.', 'Urothelial Carcinoma and Prostate-specific Membrane Antigen: Cellular, Imaging, and Prognostic Implications.', '68Ga-PSMA PET/CT in prostate cancer.', 'VEGF, EGFR and PSMA as possible imaging targets of lymph node metastases of urothelial carcinoma of the bladder.', 'Investigating PSMA differential expression in canine uroepithelial carcinomas to aid disease-based stratification and guide therapeutic selection.', 'CAR-T Cells in the Treatment of Urologic Neoplasms: Present and Future.', 'PSMA theragnostics for metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer.', 'Prognostic Value of Vascular-Expressed PSMA and CD248 in Urothelial Carcinoma of the Bladder.']"""

However, the mechanisms accounting for the elevated levels of the serum tumor markers remain to be explored. Methods We performed a pan-cancer analysis of serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and prostate-specific antigen (PSA). The relation between concentration of serum tumor markers and the expression of their coding genes was assessed. Then the expression of AFP and its genomic background in hepatocellular carcinoma (liver cancer) was studied. Results High expression of AFP mRNA was found mainly in liver cancer. In gastric cancer, breast cancer and lung cancer, high AFP mRNA expression was also discovered occasionally. In liver cancer patients, serum AFP levels correlated significantly with AFP mRNA expression in cancer tissues (r = 0.72, p = 1.6e-45). Whole transcriptome analysis revealed that serum AFP levels clearly separated liver cancer into two classes with distinct expression profiles according to PCA analysis. Gene co-expression analysis revealed that AFP expression was connected to a module enriched with genes accounting for cell cycle and cell proliferation regulation. In addition, high AFP expression was associated with the molecular classification of liver cancer, including iCluster (Chi-square: 16.86, P = 0.0002). Methylation analysis revealed de-methylation of AFP promoter occurred in some liver cancer tissues, which was significantly related to AFP mRNA expression. Survival analysis indicated high serum AFP levels was prognostic of poorer survival of the liver cancer patients (Log-rank test: p = 0.046). This was confirmed by an independent dataset in which liver cancer patients with high serum AFP also had poorer survival (Log-rank test: p = 0.024). Conclusion High expression of AFP defined a subtype of liver cancer with distinct gene expression profiles and clinical features. De-methylation of cytosine from CpG di-nucleotides in AFP promoter may be the cause of AFP re-expression in adult human liver cancer tissue.""","""['Wei Chen', 'Jianjun Peng', 'Jinning Ye', 'Weigang Dai', 'Guanghua Li', 'Yulong He']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""J Cancer""","""['Differential analysis of gene expression profiles in hepatocellular carcinoma patients with high and low levels of alpha-fetoprotein.', 'DNA methylation markers and serum α-fetoprotein level are prognostic factors in hepatocellular carcinoma.', 'Expression of alpha-fetoprotein and prostate-specific antigen genes in several tissues and detection of mRNAs in normal circulating blood by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction.', 'High level of serum AFP is an independent negative prognostic factor in gastric cancer.', 'Serum tumor markers for detection of hepatocellular carcinoma.', 'In vitro modeling of hepatocellular carcinoma niche on decellularized tomato thorny leaves: a novel natural three-dimensional (3D) scaffold for liver cancer therapeutics.', 'A robust electrochemical immunosensor based on core-shell nanostructured silica-coated silver for cancer (carcinoembryonic-antigen-CEA) diagnosis.', 'An Integrated Analysis of the Identified PRPF19 as an Onco-immunological Biomarker Encompassing the Tumor Microenvironment, Disease Progression, and Prognoses in Hepatocellular Carcinoma.', 'Genome-wide association study of serum tumor markers in Southern Chinese Han population.', 'Associations of Serum Tumor Biomarkers with Integrated Genomic and Clinical Characteristics of Hepatocellular Carcinoma.']"""

The major drawback of this approach is the associated risk for infectious complications. Sepsis rates are increasing due to rising antibiotic resistance, representing a global issue. The transperineal (TP) approach for prostate biopsy has recently been adopted at many centres as an alternative to the TR biopsy, and it was shown to be associated with a lower risk for sepsis. The aim of this study was to assess safety and tolerability of TP prostate biopsy performed in local anaesthesia.  Methods:   We retrospectively analysed data of patients who had undergone office-based TP prostate biopsy in local anaesthesia, performed by a single surgeon between January 2015 and May 2019. We evaluated the patients' acceptance of the procedure by a pain score, as well as its safety and diagnostic performance.  Results:   Four hundred patients were included. Median age was 66 years [range, 49-86]. Median prostate-specific antigen (PSA) concentration was 6.4 ng/ml [range, 0.3-1400], median PSA density was 0.15 ng/ml2 [range, 0-31.1] and median prostate volume was 40 ml [range, 6-150]. A total of 118 (29.5%) and 105 (26.2%) patients had orally received two and one doses of 500 mg fluoroquinolone, respectively, and 177 (44.3%) patients did not receive any antibiotic prophylaxis. No infectious complications occurred. Median pain score was 2.0 (range, 0-8). Overall cancer detection rate was 64.5% (258/400).  Conclusions:   Freehand TP prostate biopsy in local anaesthesia is a safe, effective and well-tolerated outpatient procedure with a high cancer detection rate. The elimination of infectious complications and its high accuracy make this technique a feasible alternative to the TR approach for the urological office. We assume that the single puncture and our trocar-like access sheath introduction technique diminish tissue trauma and bacterial exposition, and thus contribute to these promising results.""","""['Christian Wetterauer', 'Osama Shahin', 'Joel R Federer-Gsponer', 'Nicola Keller', 'Stephen Wyler', 'Hans Helge Seifert', 'Maciej Kwiatkowski']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Prostate Cancer Prostatic Dis""","""['Pain in Men Undergoing Transperineal Free-Hand Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging Fusion Targeted Biopsies under Local Anesthesia: Outcomes and Predictors from a Multicenter Study of 1,008 Patients.', 'A noninferiority within-person study comparing the accuracy of transperineal to transrectal MRI-US fusion biopsy for prostate-cancer detection.', 'Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging for the Detection of Clinically Significant Prostate Cancer: What Urologists Need to Know.

Previously, we showed that dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), one kind of androgen/neurosteroid, potentiates glioblastoma to acquire resistance through attenuating DNA damage. Androgen receptor (AR) activated by DHEA or other types of androgen was reported to promote drug resistance in prostate cancer. However, in DHEA-enriched microenvironment, the role of AR in acquiring resistance of glioblastoma remains unknown. In this study, we found that AR expression is significantly correlated with poor prognosis, and AR obviously induced the resistance to temozolomide (TMZ) treatment. Herein, we observed that ALZ003, a curcumin analog, induces FBXL2-mediated AR ubiquitination, leading to degradation. Importantly, ALZ003 significantly inhibited the survival of TMZ-sensitive and -resistant glioblastoma in vitro and in vivo. The accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), lipid peroxidation and suppression of glutathione peroxidase (GPX) 4, which are characteristics of ferroptosis, were observed in glioblastoma cell after treatment of ALZ003. Furthermore, overexpression of AR prevented ferroptosis in the presence of GPX4. To evaluate the therapeutic effect in vivo, we transplanted TMZ-sensitive or -resistant U87MG cells into mouse brain followed by intravenous administration with ALZ003. In addition to inhibiting the growth of glioblastoma, ALZ003 significantly extended the survival period of transplanted mice, and significantly decreased AR expression in the tumor area. Taken together, AR potentiates TMZ resistance for glioblastoma, and ALZ003-mediated AR ubiquitination might open a new insight into therapeutic strategy for TMZ resistant glioblastoma.""","""['Tzu-Chi Chen', 'Jian-Ying Chuang', 'Chiung-Yuan Ko', 'Tzu-Jen Kao', 'Pei-Yu Yang', 'Chun-Hui Yu', 'Ming-Sheng Liu', 'Siou-Lian Hu', 'Yu-Ting Tsai', 'Hardy Chan', 'Wen-Chang Chang', 'Tsung-I Hsu']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Redox Biol""","""['Dehydroepiandrosterone Induces Temozolomide Resistance Through Modulating Phosphorylation and Acetylation of Sp1 in Glioblastoma.', 'Cedrol suppresses glioblastoma progression by triggering DNA damage and blocking nuclear translocation of the androgen receptor.', 'Inhibition of GSH synthesis potentiates temozolomide-induced bystander effect in glioblastoma.', 'Glioblastoma Therapy Using Codelivery of Cisplatin and Glutathione Peroxidase Targeting siRNA from Iron Oxide Nanoparticles.', 'Involvement of Intracellular Cholesterol in Temozolomide-Induced Glioblastoma Cell Death.', 'Dysregulated lipid metabolism in TMZ-resistant glioblastoma: pathways, proteins, metabolites and therapeutic opportunities.', 'Implantation of hydrogel-liposome nanoplatform inhibits glioblastoma relapse by inducing ferroptosis.', 'Understanding and targeting resistance mechanisms in cancer.', 'Pyroptosis, ferroptosis, and autophagy cross-talk in glioblastoma opens up new avenues for glioblastoma treatment.', 'Hyaluronidase Promote Transdermal Diffusion of Small Sized Curcumin Nanocrystal by Dissolving Microneedles Delivery.']"""

Less is known about the role of neighborhood factors beyond individual demographics such as age or education. It is particularly important to examine neighborhood effects on health among African American men and women, considering the disproportionate impact of cancer on this group. This study evaluated the unique contribution of neighborhood characteristics (e.g., racial/ethnic diversity, income) beyond individual demographics, to cancer control behaviors in African American men and women.  Methods:   Individual-level data were drawn from a national survey (N = 2,222). Participants' home addresses were geocoded and merged with neighborhood data from the American Community Survey. Multi-level regressions examined the unique contribution of neighborhood characteristics beyond individual demographics, to a variety of cancer risk, prevention, and screening behaviors.  Results:   Neighborhood racial/ethnic diversity, median income, and percentage of home ownership made modest significant contributions beyond individual factors, in particular to smoking status where these factors were associated with lower likelihood of smoking (ps < .05). Men living in neighborhoods with older residents, and greater income and home ownership were significantly more likely to report prostate specific antigen testing (ps < .05). Regional analyses suggested different neighborhood factors were associated with smoking status depending on the region.

Moreover, western blotting and immunohistochemistry revealed altered expression of S100A4, ACKR3 and CDH1in clinical tumor samples. Cytoscape software was used to investigate the relationship between critical proteins and their signaling transduction networks. Functional and pathway enrichment analyses revealed that these signaling pathways were closely related to cellular proliferation, cell adhesion, cell migration and metastasis. In addition, ACKR3 knockout using the crispr/cas9 method andS100A4knockdownusing targeted shRNA exerted additive effects suppressing cancer cell proliferation and migration.

Patiends and methods:   All men diagnosed with PCa between April 2014 and September 2016 in the English National Health Service undergoing C-RT or H-RT were identified in the National Prostate Cancer Audit and mailed a questionnaire at least 18 months after diagnosis. We estimated differences in patient-reported urinary, bowel, sexual, and hormonal function-Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite short-form 26 domain scores on a 0 to 100 scale-and health-related quality of life-EQ-5D-5L on a 0 to 1 scale-using linear regression with adjustment for patient, tumor, and treatment-related factors in addition to GI and genitourinary baseline function, with higher scores representing better outcomes.  Results:   Of the 17,058 men in the cohort, 77% responded: 8,432 men received C-RT (64.2%) and 4,699 H-RT (35.8%). Men in the H-RT group were older (age ≥ 70 years: 67.5% v 60.9%), fewer men had locally advanced disease (56.5% v 71.3%), were less likely to receive androgen-deprivation therapy (79.5% v 87.8%), and slightly more men had pretreatment genitourinary procedures (24.2% v 21.2%). H-RT was associated with small increases in adjusted mean Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite short-form 26 sexual (3.3 points; 95% CI, 2.1 to 4.5; P < .001) and hormonal function scores (3.2 points; 95% CI, 1.8 to 4.6; P < .001). These differences failed to meet established thresholds for a clinically meaningful change. There were no statistically significant differences in urinary or bowel function and quality of life.

Materials and methods:   This retrospective study was approved by the local ethics committee. Two MR technicians scanned 2 healthy volunteers with a prototypical highly automated workflow (Siemens Healthineers GmbH, Erlangen, Germany) and with a manually adjusted scan protocol each. Thirty patients (mean age ± standard deviation, 68 ± 11 years; range, 41-93 years) with suspected prostate cancer underwent mpMRI on a 3 T MRI scanner. Fifteen patients were examined with the automated workflow and 15 patients with a conventional manual workflow. Two readers assessed image quality (contrast, zone distinction, organ margins, seminal vesicles, lymph nodes), organ coverage, orientation (T2w sequences), and artifacts (motion, susceptibility, noise) on a 5-point scale (1, poor; 5, excellent). Examination time and MR technicians' acceptance were compared between both groups. Interreader agreement was evaluated with Cohen's kappa (κ).  Results:   The automated workflow proved consistent for sequence orientation and image quality in the intraindividual comparisons. There were no significant differences in examination time (automated vs manual; median 26 vs 28 minutes; interquartile range [IQR], 25-28 minutes each; P = 0.57), study volume coverage, artifacts, or scores for T2w sequence orientation (5 vs 4 each; P > 0.3). Overall image quality was superior for automated MRI (4.6 vs 3.8; IQR, 3.9-4.8 vs 3.2-4.3; P = 0.002), especially concerning organ delineation and seminal vesicles (P = 0.045 and P = 0.013). The acceptance score was higher for the manual workflow (median, 10 vs 8; IQR, 10 vs 7-10; P = 0.002). General interreader agreement was excellent (κ = 0.832; P < 0.001).

Identifying the fatigue dimension that may be most bothersome can guide in the development of individualized management strategies.  Objective:   The purpose of this article is to describe the multidimensional fatigue experience of men with prostate cancer.  Methods:   Data for this study were obtained from an ongoing descriptive longitudinal study at the National Institutes of Health, involving men diagnosed with nonmetastatic prostate cancer scheduled to receive external beam radiation therapy. Data were analyzed at 7 time points: baseline, before treatment initiation (T1), treatment midpoint (T2), treatment completion (T3), and 1 month (T4), 3 months (T5), 6 months (T6), and 12 months (T7) after treatment completion. Study data were obtained from medical records and self-report (fatigue, depressive symptoms, and sleep disturbance) questionnaires.  Results:   Scores for total fatigue peaked at T2 and remained significantly different from baseline at T3. After T3, total fatigue scores were not significantly different from baseline. Affective fatigue had the highest scores (worst fatigue) reported during treatment, sensory fatigue scores were highest from T4 to T6, and cognitive fatigue scores were highest at T7. Affective and sensory fatigue scores peaked at T2, whereas behavioral and cognitive fatigue scores peaked at T3.  Conclusion:   Independent changes in specific dimensions of CRF were observed during and post treatment.  Implications for practice:   Understanding the specific dimensions of CRF and how they change during and post treatment can help guide clinicians to recommend targeted and personalized management strategies.""","""['Kristin Dickinson', 'Kevin Kupzyk', 'Leorey Saligan']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Cancer Nurs""","""['Different Phenotyping Approaches Lead to Dissimilar Biologic Profiles in Men With Chronic Fatigue After Radiation Therapy.', 'Co-Occurring Symptoms Contribute to Persistent Fatigue in Prostate Cancer.', 'Exploratory Investigation of Early Biomarkers for Chronic Fatigue in Prostate Cancer Patients Following Radiation Therapy.', 'Possible Bioenergetic Biomarker for Chronic Cancer-Related Fatigue.', 'Mitochondria-related gene expression changes are associated with fatigue in patients with nonmetastatic prostate cancer receiving external beam radiation therapy.', 'Systematic review of sleep and sleep disorders among prostate cancer patients and caregivers: a call to action for using validated sleep assessments during prostate cancer care.']"""

However, monitoring the protein phosphorylation status with a simple and label-free method is still clinically challenging. Here, inspired by beehives, we developed an Au-coated TiO2 macroporous inverse opal (MIO) structure with an engineered ""slow light effect"" and thus with outstanding surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) performance. The MIO structure can capture and analyze the exosomes from plasma of cancer patients without any labeling processes. It was found that the SERS intensity of exosomes at 1087 cm-1 arising from the P-O bond within the phosphoproteins can be used as a criterion for tumor liquid biopsies. The intensity of the 1087 cm-1 SERS peak from exosomes extracted from the plasma of cancer patients (prostate, lung, liver, and colon) is at least two times of that from healthy people. This indicates the simplicity and versatility of this method in cancer diagnostics.

Mostly, PCa progresses to androgen-independent PCa, which has activated AR signaling from androgen-dependent PCa. Thus, inhibition of AR signaling may be an important therapeutic target in androgen-dependent and castration-resistant PCa. In this study, we determined the anticancer effect of a newly found natural compound, sakurasosaponin (S-saponin), using androgen-dependent and castration-resistant PCa cell lines. S-saponin induces mitochondrial-mediated cell death in both androgen-dependent (LNCaP) and castration-resistant (22Rv1 and C4-2) PCa cells, via AR expression. S-saponin treatment induces a decrease in AR expression in a time- and dose-dependent manner and a potent decrease in the expression of its target genes, including prostate-specific antigen (PSA), transmembrane protease, serin 2 (TMPRSS2), and NK3 homeobox 1 (NKX3.1). Furthermore, S-saponin treatment decreases B-cell lymphoma-extra large (Bcl-xL) and mitochondrial membrane potential, thereby increasing the release of cytochrome c into the cytosol. Moreover, Bcl-xL inhibition and subsequent mitochondria-mediated cell death caused by S-saponin were reversed by Bcl-xL or AR overexpression. Interestingly, S-saponin-mediated cell death was significantly reduced by a reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenger, N-acetylcystein. Animal xenograft experiments showed that S-saponin treatment significantly reduced tumor growth of AR-positive 22Rv1 xenografts but not AR-negative PC-3 xenografts. Taken together, for the first time, our results revealed that S-saponin induces mitochondrial-mediated cell death in androgen-dependent and castration-resistant cells through regulation of AR mechanisms, including downregulation of Bcl-xL expression and induction of ROS stress by decreasing mitochondrial membrane potential.""","""['In-Sung Song#', 'Yu Jeong Jeong#', 'Jueun Kim', 'Kyoung-Hwa Seo', 'Nam-In Baek', 'Yunlim Kim', 'Choung-Soo Kim', 'Sung-Wuk Jang']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Cell Mol Life Sci""","""['Androgen receptor-dependent regulation of Bcl-xL expression: Implication in prostate cancer progression.', 'Androgen Receptor Regulation of Local Growth Hormone in Prostate Cancer Cells.', 'Benzyldihydroxyoctenone, a novel nonsteroidal antiandrogen, shows differential apoptotic induction in prostate cancer cells in response to their androgen responsiveness.', 'Androgen receptors in hormone-dependent and castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Oxidative stress and androgen receptor signaling in the development and progression of castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'MicroRNAs and Natural Compounds Mediated Regulation of TGF Signaling in Prostate Cancer.', 'Regulation of Hedgehog Signaling by miRNAs and Nanoformulations: A Possible Therapeutic Solution for Colorectal Cancer.', 'Natural Products Targeting the Mitochondria in Cancers.', 'β-Hexachlorocyclohexane: A Small Molecule with a Big Impact on Human Cellular Biochemistry.', 'Roles of Reactive Oxygen Species in Biological Behaviors of Prostate Cancer.']"""

Mutant p53 (mtp53) can inhibit the wild‑type p53 protein, disrupting its tumor suppressor functions. In addition, mutant p53 often acquires the functions of an oncogene. Post‑translational modification of the p53 protein is important for its transcriptional and tumor suppressive functions. We previously revealed that high levels of mutant p53 expression were associated with reduced expression of the deacetylation enzyme sirtuin 3 (SIRT3) in lung cancer tissues. Given this negative correlation between p53 and SIRT3 expression, and given that SIRT3 is a deacetylase, we speculated that SIRT3 participates in the post‑translational modification of mutant p53, regulating its stability and function, thereby inhibiting the growth of lung cancer cells. Light microscopy, MTT and flow cytometric assays revealed that SIRT3 overexpression inhibited growth and promoted apoptosis in NCI‑H446 human small cell lung cancer cells. SIRT3 overexpression also resulted in necroptosis, and this could be partially reversed following cell treatment with the necroptosis inhibitor necrostatin‑1 (Nec‑1), which could restore certain cells to survive. Western blotting assays revealed that SIRT3 overexpression resulted in the reduced expression and half‑life of mutant p53, indicating that SIRT3 decreases mutant p53 stability. Proteasome inhibitor experiments revealed that the decrease in mutant p53 stability was a result of increased proteasomal degradation of the protein. Immunoprecipitation studies revealed that ubiquitination of mutant p53 was elevated in SIRT3‑overexpressing cells, indicating that SIRT3 affected ubiquitination‑mediated protein degradation. In the present study, it was therefore revealed that SIRT3 can inhibit the growth of human small‑cell lung cancer cells by promoting apoptosis and necroptosis. It was also revealed that SIRT3 expression could regulate the stability of mutant p53 by controlling ubiquitination‑mediated proteasomal degradation of the protein. SIRT3 expression may therefore play an important role in the growth of mutant p53‑associated lung cancer.""","""['Xinyu Tang', 'Yang Li', 'Long Liu', 'Rui Guo', 'Ping Zhang', 'Yihe Zhang', 'Yong Zhang', 'Jia Zhao', 'Jing Su', 'Liankun Sun', 'Yanan Liu']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Oncol Rep""","""['SIRT3 increases cisplatin sensitivity of small-cell lung cancer through apoptosis.', 'Minnelide/Triptolide Impairs Mitochondrial Function by Regulating SIRT3 in P53-Dependent Manner in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer.', 'SIRT3 deacetylates and promotes degradation of P53 in PTEN-defective non-small cell lung cancer.', 'SirT3 and p53 Deacetylation in Aging and Cancer.', 'Sirtuin-3 (SIRT3), a therapeutic target with oncogenic and tumor-suppressive function in cancer.', 'Identification and validation of novel signature associated with hepatocellular carcinoma prognosis using Single-cell and WGCNA analysis.', 'Identification and Analysis of Necroptosis-Related Genes in COPD by Bioinformatics and Experimental Verification.', 'A literature review of microRNA and gene signaling pathways involved in the apoptosis pathway of lung cancer.', 'Role of Sirtuins in the Pathobiology of Onco-Hematological Diseases: A PROSPERO-Registered Study and In Silico Analysis.', 'Decreased Sirt3 contributes to cyclic production of reactive oxygen species and islet β-cell apoptosis in high glucose conditions.']"""

Our previous study has indicated that OPD' exhibits antitumor activity against androgen‑independent prostate cancer (PCa), but the effects and the underlying molecular mechanism of action of OPD' in androgen‑dependent PCa were unclear. In the present study, OPD' induced significant necroptosis in androgen‑dependent LNCaP cancer cells by activating receptor‑interacting serine/threonine‑protein kinase 1 (RIPK1). Exposure to OPD' also increased Fas ligand (FasL)‑dependent RIPK1 protein expression. The OPD'‑induced necroptosis was inhibited by a RIPK1 inhibitor necrostatin‑1, further supporting a role for RIPK1 in the effects of OPD´. The antitumor effects of OPD' were also inhibited by a mixed lineage kinase domain‑like protein (MLKL) inhibitor necrosulfonamide. Following treatment with inhibitors of RIPK1 and MLKL, the effects of OPD' on LNCaP cells were inhibited in an additive manner. In addition, co‑immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated that OPD' induced RIPK3 upregulation, leading to the assembly of a RIPK3‑MLKL complex, which was independent of RIPK1. Furthermore, OPD' increased the expression of Fas‑associated death domain, which is required to induce necroptosis in LNCaP cells. OPD' also regulated the expression levels of FasL, androgen receptor and prostate‑specific antigen in a RIPK1‑dependent manner.

Despite the efficacy, treatment‑related symptoms including fatigue greatly reduce the quality of life of cancer patients. The goal of the study is to examine the influence of combined ADT/RT on fatigue and understand its underlying mechanisms. A total of 64 participants with NMPC were enrolled. Fatigue was assessed using the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy‑Fatigue. Mitochondrial function parameters were measured as oxygen consumption from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) extracted from participants' whole blood. An ADT/RT‑induced fatigue mouse model was developed, with fatigue measured as a reduction in voluntary wheel‑running activity (VWRA) in 54 mice. Mitochondrial function was assessed in the ADT/RT mouse brains using western blot analysis of glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) and transcription factor A, mitochondrial (TFAM). The results demonstrated that fatigue in the ADT group was exacerbated during RT compared with the non‑ADT group. This effect was specific to fatigue, as depressive symptoms were unaffected. PBMCs of fatigued subjects exhibited decreased ATP coupling efficiency compared to non‑fatigued subjects, indicative of mitochondrial dysfunction. The ADT/RT mice demonstrated the synergistic effect of ADT and RT in decreasing VWRA.

In Kaplan‑Meier analyses of the two tumor types, MB positivity is associated with favorable prognoses. Despite its well‑characterized function in myocytes, the role of MB in cancer remains unclear. To study the impact of endogenous MB expression, small interfering RNA MB‑knockdown cells were engineered using breast, prostate and colon cancer cell lines (MDA‑MB468, LNCaP, DLD‑1), and their transcriptomes were investigated using RNA‑Seq at different oxygen levels. In MB‑positive cells, increased expression of glycolytic genes was observed, which was possibly mediated by a higher activity of hypoxia‑inducible factor 1α. In addition, the results of the gene set enrichment analysis suggested that MB contributed to fatty acid transport and turnover. MB‑positive, wild‑type‑p53 LNCaP cells also exhibited increased expression of p53 target genes involved in cell cycle checkpoint control and prevention of cell migration. MB‑positive cells expressing mutant p53 exhibited upregulation of genes associated with prolonged cancer cell viability and motility. Therefore, it was hypothesized that these transcriptomic differences may result from MB‑mediated generation of nitric oxide or reactive oxygen species, thus employing established enzymatic activities of the globin. In summary, the transcriptome comparisons identified potential molecular functions of MB in carcinogenesis by highlighting the interaction of MB with key metabolic and regulatory processes.""","""['Anne Bicker', 'Theresa Nauth', 'Daniela Gerst', 'Mostafa Ahmed Aboouf', 'Joachim Fandrey', 'Glen Kristiansen', 'Thomas Alexander Gorr', 'Thomas Hankeln']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Int J Mol Med""","""['Myoglobin Protects Breast Cancer Cells Due to Its ROS and NO Scavenging Properties.', 'The Distinct Gene Regulatory Network of Myoglobin in Prostate and Breast Cancer.', 'Extensive transcriptional complexity during hypoxia-regulated expression of the myoglobin gene in cancer.', 'Myoglobin: From physiological roles to potential implications in cancer.', 'Involvement of the multiple tumor suppressor genes and 12-lipoxygenase in human prostate cancer.

The aldo-keto reductase (AKR)1C3 regulates androgen receptor (AR) activity in castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) by promoting tumor tissue androgen biosynthesis from adrenal DHEA and also by functioning as an AR-selective coactivator. Herein we report that SULT2B-depleted CRPC cells, arising from stable RNA interference or gene knockout (KO), are markedly upregulated for AKR1C3, activated for ERK1/2 survival signal, and induced for epithelial-to-mesenchymal (EMT)-like changes. EMT was evident from increased mesenchymal proteins and elevated EMT-inducing transcription factors SNAI1 and TWIST1 in immunoblot and single-cell mass cytometry analyses. SULT2B KO cells showed greater motility and invasion in vitro; growth escalation in xenograft study; and enhanced metastatic potential predicted on the basis of decreased cell stiffness and adhesion revealed from atomic force microscopy analysis. While AR and androgen levels were unchanged, AR activity was elevated, since PSA and FKBP5 mRNA induction by DHT-activated AR was several-fold higher in SULT2B-silenced cells. AKR1C3 silencing prevented ERK1/2 activation and SNAI1 induction in SULT2B-depleted cells. SULT2B was undetectable in nearly all CRPC metastases from 50 autopsy cases. Primary tumors showed variable and Gleason score (GS)-independent SULT2B levels. CRPC metastases lacking SULT2B expressed AKR1C3. Since AKR1C3 is frequently elevated in advanced prostate cancer, the inhibitory influence of SULT2B on AKR1C3 upregulation, ERK1/2 activation, EMT-like induction, and on cell motility and invasiveness may be clinically significant. Pathways regulating the inhibitory SULT2B-AKR1C3 axis may inform new avenue(s) for targeting SULT2B-deficient prostate cancer.""","""['Sulgi Park', 'Chung-Seog Song', 'Chun-Lin Lin', 'Shoulei Jiang', 'Pawel A Osmulski', 'Chiou-Miin Wang', 'Brett T Marck', 'Alvin M Matsumoto', 'Colm Morrissey', 'Maria E Gaczynska', 'Yidong Chen', 'Elahe A Mostaghel', 'Bandana Chatterjee']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Endocrinology""","""['SULT2B1b sulfotransferase: induction by vitamin D receptor and reduced expression in prostate cancer.', 'Steroidogenic enzyme AKR1C3 is a novel androgen receptor-selective coactivator that promotes prostate cancer growth.', 'Aldo-keto reductase family 1 member C3 (AKR1C3) is a biomarker and therapeutic target for castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'AKR1C3 as a target in castrate resistant prostate cancer.', 'The DHEA-sulfate depot following P450c17 inhibition supports the case for AKR1C3 inhibition in high risk localized and advanced castration resistant prostate cancer.', 'Detection of Increased Expression of Claudin-1 in Triple-Negative Breast Cancer: Analysis and Clinical-Pathological Correlation.', 'Reduced SULT2B1b expression alleviates ox-LDL-induced inflammation by upregulating miR-148-3P via inhibiting the IKKβ/NF-κB pathway in macrophages.']"""

Despite the reported therapeutic effects of this natural chemical entity, inhibitory potential of hispolon towards prostate carcinoma DU145 cells and mechanism of its action are yet to be explicated. Deregulated STAT3 pathway performs multifaceted functions in facilitating the development of cancer. Here, we have investigated the mechanism of hispolon by which it exerts its anticancer effects in DU145 cells and whether its anticancer activity is mediated by modulation of STAT3. Our outcomes show that hispolon significantly halted the multiplication of DU145 cells as well as arrested cell cycle at S phase. S phase arrest induced by hispolon was associated with downregulation of cyclin B1, cyclin D1 and CDK4 while up-regulation of p21. Moreover, hispolon treatment leads towards induction of apoptosis in a dose-dependent mode in DU145 cells. Hispolon induced modulation of Bcl-2 family proteins lead towards loss of MMP allowing the discharge of cytochrome c from mitochondrial porin channels which triggered the cascade of caspases ultimately causing cellular death. We further investigated the role of hispolon in mediating deregulated STAT3 pathways in DU145 cells. Hispolon has potential to downregulate the p-STAT3 expression with no effect on total STAT3. Contemporaneously, these results represent that hispolon's anticancer mechanism of action proceeds via downregulating the phosphorylation of STAT3 and induction of apoptosis via mitochondrial pathway.""","""['Muqaddas Masood', 'Azhar Rasul', 'Iqra Sarfraz', 'Faiza Jabeen', 'Sitong Liu', 'Xintong Liu', 'Wei Wei', 'Jiang Li', 'Xiaomeng Li']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Pak J Pharm Sci""","""['Hispolon from Phellinus linteus induces G0/G1 cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in NB4 human leukaemia cells.', 'Genistein induced anticancer effects on pancreatic cancer cell lines involves mitochondrial apoptosis, G0/G1cell cycle arrest and regulation of STAT3 signalling pathway.', 'Scoparone exerts anti-tumor activity against DU145 prostate cancer cells via inhibition of STAT3 activity.', 'Anticancer Perspectives on the Fungal-Derived Polyphenolic Hispolon.', 'Hispolon: A natural polyphenol and emerging cancer killer by multiple cellular signaling pathways.', 'Augmentation of Docetaxel-Induced Cytotoxicity in Human PC-3 Androgen-Independent Prostate Cancer Cells by Combination With Four Natural Apoptosis-Inducing Anticancer Compounds.', 'Hispolon induces apoptosis in oral squamous cell carcinoma cells through JNK/HO-1 pathway activation.', 'Immunomodulatory Effect of Hispolon on LPS-Induced RAW264.7 Cells and Mitogen/Alloantigen-Stimulated Spleen Lymphocytes of Mice.', 'How Should the Worldwide Knowledge of Traditional Cancer Healing Be Integrated with Herbs and Mushrooms into Modern Molecular Pharmacology?', 'Molecular Basis of Prostate Cancer and Natural Products as Potential Chemotherapeutic and Chemopreventive Agents.']"""

Although BUB1B was found to be essential for cell growth and proliferation, even in several kinds of tumor cells, the specific importance and mechanistic role of BUB1B in prostate cancer remain unclear.  Methods:   Quantitative Real-Time PCR and Western-blot were used in the detection of mRNA and protein expression. Lentivirus infection was used to overexpression or knock down the target gene. Flow cytometry analysis was performed to test protein expression and apoptosis level. Immunohistochemistry was used to identify protein expression in tissue. Statistical differences between the two groups are evaluated by two-tailed t-tests. The comparison among multiple groups is performed by one-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) followed by Dunnett's posttest. The statistical significance of the Kaplan-Meier survival plot is determined by log-rank analysis.  Results:   In the present report, we found BUB1B expression to be highly increased in prostate cancer tissues relative to normal controls. We further found BUB1B to be essential for efficient tumor cell proliferation, and to correlate with poorer prostate cancer patient outcomes. From a mechanistic perspective, the ability of BUB1B to regulate MELK was found to be essential for its ability to promote prostate cancer cell proliferation.  Conclusion:   Altogether, our data suggest that BUB1B is up-regulated in prostate cancer, suggesting that the growth of cancer cells may depend on BUB1B-dependent regulation of MELK transcription.

Among 9492 evaluable prostate cancers, 9% expressed survivin strongly, 19% moderately, 28% weakly, and 44% lacked it. Loss of cytoplasmic survivin was seen in advanced tumor stage, higher Gleason score, preoperative PSA levels, and Ki-67 labeling index, and associated with earlier PSA recurrence (P < .0001).

Multivariate analysis revealed that reduced cytoplasmic survivin expression predicted poor prognosis independent from Gleason score, pT, pN, and serum PSA level. This was valid for ERG-positive and ERG-negative cancers.

To extend the structure-activity relationships (SAR) to other estrane analogs, we synthesized a focused series of RM-581 derivatives at position C3 or C2 of its steroidal core. These new AM derivatives were first tested on a large selection of prostate, breast, pancreatic and ovarian cancer cell lines. The impact of these modifications on metabolic stability (human liver microsomes) was also measured. A SAR study revealed a fine regulation of anticancer activity related to the nature of the substituent. Indeed, the addition of potential prodrug groups like acetate, sulfamate or phosphate (compounds 8, 9 and 10) at C3 of the phenolic counterpart provided better antiproliferative activities than RM-581 in breast and pancreatic cancer cell types while maintaining activity in other cancer cell lines. Also, the phosphate group was highly beneficial on water solubility. However, the bulkier carbamate prodrugs 6 (N,N-dimethyl) and 7 (N,N-diethyl) were less active. Otherwise, carbon homologation (CH2) at C2 (compound 33) was beneficial to metabolic stability and, in the meantime, this AM conserved the same anticancer activity as RM-581. However, the replacement of the hydroxy or methoxy at C3 by a hydrogen or an acetyl (compound 17 or 21b) was detrimental for anticancer activity, pointing to a crucial molecular interaction of the aromatic oxygen atom at this position. Overall, this work provided a better knowledge of the structural requirements to maintain RM-581's anticancer activity, and also identified minor structural modifications to increase both metabolic stability and water solubility, three important parameters of pharmacological development.""","""['René Maltais', 'Martin Perreault', 'Jenny Roy', 'Donald Poirier']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Eur J Med Chem""","""['Parallel Solid-Phase Synthesis using a New Diethylsilylacetylenic Linker and Leading to Mestranol Derivatives with Potent Antiproliferative Activities on Multiple Cancer Cell Lines.', 'Induction of endoplasmic reticulum stress by aminosteroid derivative RM-581 leads to tumor regression in PANC-1 xenograft model.', 'Explorative study on the anticancer activity, selectivity and metabolic stability of related analogs of aminosteroid RM-133.', 'Cephalostatin analogues--synthesis and biological activity.', 'Natural product evodiamine-inspired medicinal chemistry: Anticancer activity, structural optimization and structure-activity relationship.', 'Aminosteroid RM-581 Decreases Cell Proliferation of All Breast Cancer Molecular Subtypes, Alone and in Combination with Breast Cancer Treatments.', 'Chemical Synthesis and Biological Evaluation of 3-Substituted Estrone/Estradiol Derivatives as 17β-Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenase Type 1 Inhibitors Acting via a Reverse Orientation of the Natural Substrate Estrone.']"""

The purpose of this work is to evaluate the action and mode of action of Chinese Medicine recipe HS in inhibiting prostate cancer progression in preclinical models.  Methods:   Effects of HS were analyzed in prostate cancer cell lines by evaluating proliferation, cell cycle profile, DNA damage and key regulators responsible for G2 to M phase transition. The transcriptional activities of these regulators were determined by RT-PCR and ChIP. The efficacy of HS in vitro was validated in an animal model.  Results:   HS treatment was observed to reduce DNA content and accumulated prostate cancer cells at the G2/M phase. Immunolabeling for phospho-Histone H3 in association with nocodazole to capture mitotic cells confirmed that HS impeded G2 to M transition. After excluding DNA damage-induced G2 arrest, it was revealed that HS reduced expression of Cyclin B1, CDK1, PLK1 and Aurora A at both protein and mRNA levels, with concomitant reduction of H3K4 tri-methylation at their promoter-regions. Animals that received oral administration of HS with a dosage relevant to clinical application showed reduced tumor volume and weight with a reduction of Cyclin B1, CDK1, PLK1 and Aurora A protein levels.

We investigated the potential association of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes encoding drug transporters and drug-metabolizing enzymes with cabazitaxel toxicity, overall survival (OS) and pharmacokinetics (PK).  Methods:   A total of 128 cabazitaxel-treated mCRPC patients, of whom prospectively collected data on toxicity and OS were available and 24 mCRPC patients with available cabazitaxel PK measurements, were genotyped using genomic DNA obtained from EDTA blood. The SLCO1B1 (388A > G; *1B; rs2306283 and 521 T > C; *5; rs4149056 and haplotype SLCO1B1*15), SLCO1B3 (334 T > G; rs4149117), CYP3A4 (*22; rs35599367), CYP3A5 (*3; rs776746), ABCB1 (3435C > T; rs1045642), and TUBB1 (57 + 87A > C; rs463312) SNPs were tested for their association with clinical and PK parameters by univariate/multivariate logistic regression, log-rank test, or Kruskal-Wallis test.  Results:   The SLCO1B1*15 haplotype was significantly associated with a lower incidence of leukopenia and neutropenia (p = 0.020 and p = 0.028, respectively). Patients harboring a homozygous variant for SLCO1B1*1B experienced higher rate ≥ grade 3 (p = 0.042). None of the SNPs were associated with pharmacokinetics or OS.  Conclusions:   In this study, SLCO1B1 (SLCO1B1*15 and SLCO1B1*1B) was associated with cabazitaxel-induced adverse events in mCRPC patients.

The purpose of this study was to identify the main active compounds from CKI and to investigate its anti-cancer mechanisms via drug target biological network pharmacology construction and prediction. MATERIAL AND METHODS Constituents of CKI were retrieved from Traditional Chinese Medicine Systems Pharmacology (TCMSP) database. Disease targets were collected in the Human Gene (Gene Cards) and Human Mendelian Inheritance (OMIM) databases. ""Ingredients-protein targets-pathway"" networks were constructed using Cytoscape. STRING database platform to construct enrichment of protein-protein interactions (PPI), related diseases and pathways network. Gene Ontology (GO) biological functions and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway of were performed to investigate by using Bioconductor tool for analysis. RESULTS The results indicated that 60 constituents of absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) filtration resulted in 33 constituents exhibiting significant correlations with anti-cancer and CKI may target 113 proteins, including IL6, EGFR, CASP3, VEGFA, MYC, and ESR1. GO and KEGG enrichment analysis results show that 129 biological processes and 93 signal pathways associated with cancer. It mainly involves cancers such as prostate cancer, bladder cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, colorectal cancer, breast cancer, etc. Active ingredients might also induce apoptosis in cancer cells via the p53 and PI3K-Akt signaling pathway mechanism. CONCLUSIONS This study was based on pharmacological networks results for the prediction of the multi-constituent, multi-target, and multi-pathway mechanisms of CKI, which might be a promising potential therapeutic and prevention candidate for anti-cancer. However, based on computer data mining and analysis, this study still needs to be further verified by in vivo/in vitro experiments, and the safety of CKI needs to be evaluated.""","""['Ruirong He', 'Shuya Ou', 'Shichun Chen', 'Shaobo Ding']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Med Sci Monit""","""['Study on the mechanisms of compound Kushen injection for the treatment of gastric cancer based on network pharmacology.', 'Compound Kushen injection inhibits EMT of gastric cancer cells via the PI3K/AKT pathway.', 'Virtual screening of the multi-gene regulatory molecular mechanism of Si-Wu-tang against non-triple-negative breast cancer based on network pharmacology combined with experimental validation.', 'Exploration of the mechanism of Zisheng Shenqi decoction against gout arthritis using network pharmacology.', 'Anti-tumor activities of active ingredients in Compound Kushen Injection.', 'Identification of glycogen phosphorylase L as a potential target for lung cancer.', 'Exploring the molecular mechanism of Gan Shuang granules for the treatment of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis using network pharmacology, molecular docking, and experimental verification.', 'Isorhamnetin inhibits progression of ovarian cancer by targeting ESR1.', 'A study of the therapeutic mechanism of Jakyakgamcho-Tang about functional dyspepsia through network pharmacology research.', 'Decoding the Key Functional Combined Components Group and Uncovering the Molecular Mechanism of Longdan Xiegan Decoction in Treating Uveitis.']"""

Materials and methods:   We queried the Cryo On-Line Database registry for men who had undergone SFC and STC of the prostate for RT-persistent or recurrent disease. Propensity score weighting was used to match age at treatment, presalvage therapy prostate-specific antigen level, Gleason sum, and presalvage cryotherapy androgen deprivation therapy status. The primary outcome was progression-free survival.  Results:   A total of 385 men with biopsy-proven persistent or recurrent prostate cancer after primary RT were included in the present study. The median follow-up, age, prostate-specific antigen, and Gleason sum before salvage cryotherapy was 24.4 months (first and third quartile, 9.8 and 60.3), 70 years (first and third quartile, 66 and 74 years), 4 ng/dL (first and third quartile, 2.7 and 5.6 ng/dL), and 7 (first and third quartile, 6 and 8), respectively. After propensity score weighting, the difference in progression-free survival was not statistically significant between the patients who had undergone STC and those who had undergone SFC (79.8% vs. 76.98%; P = .11 on weighted log-rank test). SFC was associated with a lower probability of post-treatment transient urinary retention (5.6% vs. 22.4%; P < .001). No significant differences were found in the incidence of rectal fistula (1.4% vs. 3.8; P = .30), new-onset urinary incontinence within 12 months (9.3% vs. 15.1%; P = .19), or new-onset erectile dysfunction within 12 months (52.6% vs. 59.6%; P = .47) between the SFC and STC groups, respectively.

There is also a gap in life expectancy between males and females. DNA methylation differences have been shown to be associated with both age and sex. Here, we investigate age-by-sex differences in blood-based DNA methylation in an unrelated cohort of 2586 individuals between the ages of 18 and 87 years, with replication in a further 4450 individuals between the ages of 18 and 93 years.  Methods:   Linear regression models were applied, with stringent genome-wide significance thresholds (p < 3.6 × 10-8) used in both the discovery and replication data. A second, highly conservative mixed linear model method that better controls the false-positive rate was also applied, using the same genome-wide significance thresholds.  Results:   Using the linear regression method, 52 autosomal and 597 X-linked CpG sites, mapping to 251 unique genes, replicated with concordant effect size directions in the age-by-sex interaction analysis. The site with the greatest difference mapped to GAGE10, an X-linked gene. Here, DNA methylation levels remained stable across the male adult age range (DNA methylation by age r = 0.02) but decreased across female adult age range (DNA methylation by age r = - 0.61). One site (cg23722529) with a significant age-by-sex interaction also had a quantitative trait locus (rs17321482) that is a genome-wide significant variant for prostate cancer. The mixed linear model method identified 11 CpG sites associated with the age-by-sex interaction.  Conclusion:   The majority of differences in age-associated DNA methylation trajectories between sexes are present on the X chromosome.

A percentage of positive biopsies > 50% is usually considered as a contra-indication, and the tumor location could also influence the treatment efficacy. We studied the association of the percentage of positive biopsy cores, and tumor location, with progression-free survival.  Methods:   Among the 382 patients treated at our center by permanent implant iodine seed brachytherapy for a localized prostate cancer between 2006 and 2013, 282 had accessible detailed pathology reports, a minimum follow-up of 6 months, and were included. Progression was defined as a biochemical, local, nodal, or distant metastatic relapse. We studied cancer location on biopsies (base, midgland or apex of the prostate) and percentage of positive biopsy cores, as well as potential confounders (pre-treatment PSA, tumor stage, Gleason score, risk group according to D'Amico's classification modified by Zumsteg, adjunction of androgen deprivation therapy, and dosimetric data).  Results:   Most patients (197; 69.9%) had a low risk, 67 (23.8%) a favorable intermediate risk, 16 (5.7%) an unfavorable intermediate risk, and 1 (0.3%) a high-risk prostate cancer. An involvement of the apex was found for 131 patients (46,5%), of the midgland for 149 (52,8%), and of the base for 145 (51,4%). The median percentage of positive biopsy cores was 17% [3-75%]. The median follow-up was 64 months [12-140]. Twenty patients (7%) progressed: 4 progressions (20%) were biochemical only, 7 (35%) were prostatic or seminal, 6 (30%) were nodal, and 3 (15%) were metastatic. The median time to failure was 39.5 months [9-108]. There were more Gleason scores ≥7 among patients who progressed (40% vs 19%; p = 0.042). None of the studied covariates (including tumor location, and percentage of positive biopsy cores), were significantly associated with progression-free survival. The risk group showed a trend towards an association (p = 0.055).

Interestingly, the peptide not only served as recognition probe to detect PSA, but also acted as the enhancer to improve the enzyme activity of hemin/G4, which promoted the detection sensitivity. Up addition of PSA, Fe3O4-labeled DNAzyme-peptide probe was cleaved, followed by the magnetic separation. The cleaved DNAzyme-peptide was then captured onto the cysteine-modified electrode via the interaction between carboxyl groups of peptide and amino group of cysteine. A strong electrochemical signal was obtained from hemin and further was amplified by the enhanced electrocatalysis of DNAzyme-peptide. Compared to the original DNAzyme, DNAzyme-peptide exhibited more than 3-fold enhancement in signal amplification. And MoSe2@rGO amplified the electrochemical signal due to its good conductivity and large surface area. So the proposed strategy detected PSA down to 0.3 fg/mL, and it showed the advantages of simplicity, low cost by avoiding the use of expensive protein enzyme and additional electroactive species. Therefore, the proposed biosensor potentially provided a very effective tool for early diagnosis of cancer by the detection of PSA.""","""['Zhuo Ye', 'Gaiping Li', 'Lingling Xu', 'Qian Yu', 'Xiaoyue Yue', 'Yongmei Wu', 'Baoxian Ye']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Talanta""","""['Novel electrochemical biosensor based on cationic peptide modified hemin/G-quadruples enhanced peroxidase-like activity.', 'Highly sensitive electrochemical thrombin aptasensor based on peptide-enhanced electrocatalysis of hemin/G-quadruplex and nanocomposite as nanocarrier.', 'Target-inspired Pb2+-dependent DNAzyme for ultrasensitive electrochemical sensor based on MoS2-AuPt nanocomposites and hemin/G-quadruplex DNAzyme as signal amplifier.', 'Electrochemical DNAzyme-based biosensors for disease diagnosis.', 'Advances in prostate specific antigen biosensors-impact of nanotechnology.', 'MXene-Based Nucleic Acid Biosensors for Agricultural and Food Systems.', 'Electrochemical nanobiosensors equipped with peptides: a review.', 'The Role of Peptides in the Design of Electrochemical Biosensors for Clinical Diagnostics.']"""

However, whether SOX30 is involved in the development and progression of prostate cancer remains unknown. This study investigated the potential role of SOX30 in prostate cancer.  Methods:   Prostate cancer cell lines and a normal prostate epithelial cell line were used for the experiments. The expression of SOX30 was determined using quantitative real-time PCR and western blot analysis. The malignant cellular behaviors of prostate cancer were assessed using the Cell Counting Kit-8, colony formation and Matrigel invasion assays. The miRNA-mRNA interaction was validated using the dual-luciferase reporter assay.  Results:   SOX30 expression was lower in cells of prostate cancer lines than in cells of the normal prostate epithelial line. Its overexpression repressed the proliferation and invasion of prostate cancer cells. SOX30 was identified as a target gene of microRNA-653-5p (miR-653-5p), which is upregulated in prostate cancer tissues. MiR-653-5p overexpression decreased SOX30 expression, while its inhibition increased SOX30 expression in prostate cancer cells. MiR-653-5p inhibition also markedly restricted prostate cancer cell proliferation and invasion. SOX30 overexpression or miR-653-5p inhibition significantly reduced β-catenin expression and downregulated the activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling. SOX30 knockdown significantly reversed the miR-653-5p inhibition-mediated inhibitory effect on the proliferation, invasion and Wnt/β-catenin signaling in prostate cancer cells.  Conclusions:   These results reveal a tumor suppressive function for SOX30 in prostate cancer and confirmed the gene as a target of miR-653-5p. SOX30 upregulation due to miR-653-5p inhibition restricted the proliferation and invasion of prostate cancer cells, and this was associated with Wnt/β-catenin signaling suppression.

In particular, we showed that, in prostate cancer, PTEN loss appears to establish an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment through the activation of STAT3, and low PTEN expression levels have a detrimental impact on patient disease-free survival.

The biggest challenge to overcome cancer is to identify driver genes that promote the cancer development from a huge amount of passenger mutations that have no effect on the selective growth advantage of cancer. In order to solve those problems, some researchers have started to focus on identification of driver genes by integrating networks with other biological information. However, more efforts should be needed to improve the prediction performance.  Methods:   Considering the facts that driver genes have impact on expression of their downstream genes, they likely interact with each other to form functional modules and those modules should tend to be expressed similarly in the same tissue. We proposed a novel model named by DyTidriver to identify driver genes through involving the gene dysregulated expression, tissue-specific expression and variation frequency into the human functional interaction network (e.g. human FIN).  Results:   This method was applied on 974 breast, 316 prostate and 230 lung cancer patients. The consequence shows our method outperformed other five existing methods in terms of Fscore, Precision and Recall values. The enrichment and cociter analysis illustrate DyTidriver can not only identifies the driver genes enriched in some significant pathways but also has the capability to figure out some unknown driver genes.

This study examined methods for enhancing the reporting of cancer incidence among Aboriginal people using linked data methodologies.  Methods:   Invasive cancers diagnosed in New South Wales (NSW), Australia, in 2010-2014 were identified from the NSW Cancer Registry (NSWCR). The NSWCR data were linked to the NSW Admitted Patient Data Collection, the NSW Emergency Department Data Collection and the Australian Coordinating Register Cause of Death Unit Record File. The following methods for enhancing the identification of Aboriginal people were used: 'ever-reported', 'reported on most recent record', 'weight of evidence' and 'multi-stage median'. The impact of these methods on the number of cancer cases and age-standardised cancer incidence rates (ASR) among Aboriginal people was explored.  Results:   Of the 204,948 cases of invasive cancer, 2703 (1.3%) were recorded as Aboriginal on the NSWCR. This increased with enhancement methods to 4184 (2.0%, 'ever'), 3257 (1.6%, 'most recent'), 3580 (1.7%, 'weight of evidence') and 3583 (1.7%, 'multi-stage median'). Enhancement was generally greater in relative terms for males, people aged 25-34 years, people with cancers of localised or unknown degree of spread, people living in urban areas and areas with less socio-economic disadvantage. All enhancement methods increased ASRs for Aboriginal people. The weight of evidence method increased the overall ASR by 42% for males (894.1 per 100,000, 95% CI 844.5-945.4) and 27% for females (642.7 per 100,000, 95% CI 607.9-678.7). Greatest relative increases were observed for melanoma and prostate cancer incidence (126 and 63%, respectively). ASRs for prostate and breast cancer increased from below to above the ASRs of non-Aboriginal people with enhancement of Aboriginal status.

Recent studies have suggested signaling downstream of Na+ /K+ -ATPase action in the regulation of cell proliferation and apoptosis and have revealed the anticancer activity of cardiac glycosides. The study aims to characterize the anticancer potential of ascleposide, a natural cardenolide, and to uncover its primary target and underlying mechanism against human castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC).  Methods:   Cell proliferation was examined in CRPC PC-3 and DU-145 cells using sulforhodamine B assay, carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester staining assay and clonogenic examination. Flow cytometric analysis was used to detect the distribution of cell cycle phase, mitochondrial membrane potential, intracellular Na+ and Ca2+ levels, and reactive oxygen species production. Protein expression was examined using Western blot analysis. Endocytosis of Na+ /K+ -ATPase was determined using confocal immunofluorescence microscopic examination.  Results:   Ascleposide induced an increase of intracellular Na+ and a potent antiproliferative effect. It also induced a decrease of G1 phase distribution while an increase in both G2/M and apoptotic sub-G1 phases, and downregulated several cell cycle regulator proteins, including cyclins, Cdk, p21, and p27 Cip/Kip proteins, Rb and c-Myc. Ascleposide decreased the expression of antiapoptotic Bcl-2 members (eg, Bcl-2 and Mcl-1) but upregulated proapoptotic member (eg, Bak), leading to a significant loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and activation of both caspase-9 and caspase-3. Ascleposide also dramatically induced tubulin acetylation, leading to inhibition of the catalytic activity of Na+ /K+ -ATPase. Notably, extracellular high K+ (16 mM) significantly blunted ascleposide-mediated effects. Furthermore, ascleposide induced a p38 MAPK-dependent endocytosis of Na+ /K+ -ATPase and downregulated the protein expression of Na+ /K+ -ATPase α1 subunit.  Conclusion:   Ascleposide displays antiproliferative and apoptotic activities dependent on the inhibition of Na+ /K+ -ATPase pumping activity through p38 MAPK-mediated endocytosis of Na+ /K+ -ATPase and downregulation of α1 subunit, which in turn cause tubulin acetylation and cell cycle arrest. Cell apoptosis is ultimately triggered by the activation of caspase cascade attributed to mitochondrial damage through the downregulation of Bcl-2 and Mcl-1 protein expressions while upregulation of Bak protein levels. The data also suggest the potential of ascleposide in anti-CRPC development.""","""['Wohn-Jenn Leu', 'Ching-Ting Wang', 'Jui-Ling Hsu', 'Ih-Sheng Chen', 'Hsun-Shuo Chang', 'Jih-Hwa Guh']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Reevesioside A, a cardenolide glycoside, induces anticancer activity against human hormone-refractory prostate cancers through suppression of c-myc expression and induction of G1 arrest of the cell cycle.', 'Repurposing of phentolamine as a potential anticancer agent against human castration-resistant prostate cancer: A central role on microtubule stabilization and mitochondrial apoptosis pathway.', 'Reevesioside F induces potent and efficient anti-proliferative and apoptotic activities through Na⁺/K⁺-ATPase α3 subunit-involved mitochondrial stress and amplification of caspase cascades.', 'Targeting Na⁺/K⁺ -translocating adenosine triphosphatase in cancer treatment.', 'Cardiotonic steroids-mediated Na+/K+-ATPase targeting could circumvent various chemoresistance pathways.', 'Cardiac Glycosides as Immune System Modulators.', 'Study on the Drug Targets and Molecular Mechanisms of Rhizoma Curcumae in the Treatment of Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma Based on Network Pharmacology.']"""

Genomic expression analyses of stromal infiltration markers were performed to determine the significance thereof in prostate cancer.  Methods:   Genome-wide expression profiles of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded radical prostatectomy samples were evaluated from a prospective registry cohort (n = 5239) and 3 retrospective institutional cohorts (n = 1135). Two independent stromal gene expression signatures implied stromal infiltration. Cox proportional hazards regression defined the association between stromal infiltration expression and metastasis-free survival (MFS).  Results:   Stromal expression scores were correlated with stromal signature genes and with other key stromal markers (CAV1, VIM, and TAGLN), basal activity, and CD3 and CD4 immune biomarkers (r > 0.5 for all). The top decile of stromal expression was associated with high genomic risk scores (Decipher ≥ 0.6) , high Cancer of the Prostate Risk Assessment-Postsurgical scores, Gleason 9 to 10 disease, and a higher risk for metastasis (hazard ratio, 2.35; 95% CI, 1.37-4.02; P = .001). A higher stromal infiltration score was also associated with decreased expression of DNA repair genes and higher radiation sensitivity genomic scores. Postoperative radiation therapy (RT) was associated with an MFS benefit for patients with high stromal scores, but not for patients with low stromal scores (Pinteraction = .02).

Copy number variations at the SIRPB1 locus were previously reported to associate with prostate cancer aggressiveness in patients, however, the role of SIRPB1 in prostate carcinogenesis is unknown.  Methods:   Fluorescence in situ hybridization and laser-capture microdissection coupled with quantitative polymerase chain reaction was utilized to determine SIRPB1 gene amplification and messenger RNA expression in prostate cancer specimens. The effect of knockdown of SIRPB1 by RNA interference in PC3 prostate cancer cells on cell growth in colony formation assays and cell mobility in wound-healing, transwell assays, and cell cycle analysis was determined. Overexpression of SIPRB1 in C4-2 prostate cancer cells on cell migration, invasion, colony formation and cell cycle progression and tumor take rate in xenografts was also determined. Western blot assay of potential downstream SIRPB1 pathways was also performed.  Results:   SIRPB1 gene amplification was detected in up to 37.5% of prostate cancer specimens based on in silico analysis of several publicly available datasets. SIRPB1 gene amplification and overexpression were detected in prostate cancer specimens. The knockdown of SIRPB1 significantly suppressed cell growth in colony formation assays and cell mobility. SIRPB1 knockdown also induced cell cycle arrest during the G0 /G1 phase and enhancement of apoptosis. Conversely, overexpression of SIPRB1 in C4-2 prostate cancer cells significantly enhanced cell migration, invasion, colony formation, and cell cycle progression and increased C4-2 xenograft tumor take rate in nude mice. Finally, this study presented evidence for SIRPB1 regulation of Akt phosphorylation and showed that Akt inhibition could abolish SIRPB1 stimulation of prostate cancer cell proliferation.

Patients and methods:   In total, 109,182 patients aged 18 to 64 years diagnosed with a common cancer (lung, breast, or prostate cancer) were identified from 2010 to 2014. Multivariable logistic regressions analyzed associations between ACA implementation and uninsured rates on the basis of state approach to Medicaid expansion, stratified by race (black, white), and income (stratified at 138% Federal Poverty Line).  Results:   Uninsured rates declined after ACA implementation, with the greatest rate reductions associated with traditional Medicaid expansion (Pinteraction <0.001). Racial disparities in insurance coverage were eliminated with traditional Medicaid expansion where the uninsured rate went from 10.0% to 0.95% among black patients (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]pre-aca 1.52 to AORpost-aca 0.47) but persisted with other state approaches (AORpre-aca 1.15 to AORpost-aca 1.12) (Pinteraction =0.002).

Methods:   We retrospectively investigated 36 patients with pre-treatment mp-MRI and CT images who were treated using pencil beam scanning (PBS) proton radiation therapy to the whole prostate. DILs were contoured on co-registered mp-MRIs. Simultaneous integrated boost (SIB) plans using intensity-modulated proton therapy (IMPT) were created based on conventional whole-prostate-irradiation for each patient and optimized with additional DIL coverage goals and urethral constraints. DIL dose coverage and organ-at-risk (OAR) sparing were compared between conventional and SIB plans. Tumor control probability (TCP) and normal tissue complication probability (NTCP) were estimated to evaluate the clinical impact of the SIB plans.  Results:   Optimized SIB plans significantly escalated the dose to DILs while meeting OAR constraints. SIB plans were able to achieve 125, 150 and 175% of prescription dose coverage in 74, 54 and 17% of 36 patients, respectively. This was modeled to result in an increase in DIL TCP by 7.3-13.3% depending on α/β and DIL risk level.  Conclusion:   The proposed mp-MRI-guided DIL boost using proton radiation therapy is feasible without violating OAR constraints and demonstrates a potential clinical benefit by improving DIL TCP.

Monte Carlo (MC) simulations of the IMRT techniques and dosimetric comparison were also performed on a standard patient data.  Results:   The 2 mm thickness artificial walls showed the minimum differences with the true bladder and rectum walls based on absolute evaluations (the maximum difference < 10cc and standard deviation < 15cc). However, relative evaluations showed that all the artificial walls had high correlations with real walls for selecting dose volume parameters. There was also good agreement between the treatment planning system and MC simulations results.  Conclusion:   The DVH of whole organs was not a good surrogate of the true wall.

Current studies have found that extracellular vesicles (EVs) and circular RNAs (circRNAs) have important functions in various tumours and other diseases. In this study, the detection of circRNAs in PCa showed that circ_SLC19A1 was increased in PCa cells and their secreted EVs. EVs with high expression of circ_SLC19A1 could be taken up by PCa cells, which promoted cell proliferation and invasion. The sequence of circ_SLC19A1 contained multiple binding sites for miR-497, and circ_SLC19A1 could bind directly to miR-497 in cells. The expression of miR-497 was downregulated in PCa cells, while the expression of its target gene septin 2 (SEPT2) was upregulated significantly. Transfection of circ_SLC19A1 small interfering RNA (siRNA) or miR-497 mimics could significantly inhibit the expression of SEPT2 and the phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 and 2 (ERK1/2). After co-transfection of circ_SLC19A1 siRNA and miR-497 inhibitors or SEPT2 overexpression vector, the expression of SEPT2 and ERK1/2 phosphorylation levels showed no significant changes. Similar results were obtained with co-transfection of miR-497 mimics and the SEPT2 overexpression vector. Therefore, cancer cells can regulate the expression of SEPT2 through miR-497 by secreting EVs with high expression of circ_SLC19A1, thus affecting the activation of the downstream ERK1/2 pathway and ultimately regulating PCa cell growth and invasion. Therefore, EV-derived circ_SLC19A1 plays an important regulatory role in PCa and may be an important target for PCa prevention and treatment.""","""['Yu Zheng', 'Jian-Xin Li', 'Chao-Jiang Chen', 'Zhuo-Yuan Lin', 'Jia-Xuan Liu', 'Fu-Jun Lin']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Cell Biol Int""","""['Circ_KATNAL1 regulates prostate cancer cell growth and invasiveness through the miR-145-3p/WISP1 pathway.', 'Circ_0057558 accelerates the development of prostate cancer through miR-1238-3p/SEPT2 axis.', 'Circular RNA Expression Profiling Identifies Prostate Cancer- Specific circRNAs in Prostate Cancer.', 'Communication of prostate cancer cells with bone cells via extracellular vesicle RNA; a potential mechanism of metastasis.', 'Circulating RNAs in prostate cancer patients.', 'Mechanism of tumor-derived extracellular vesicles in prostatic cancer progression through the circFMN2/KLF2/RNF128 axis.', 'The function and mechanisms of action of circular RNAs in Urologic Cancer.', 'The Circular RNA Circ_0085494 Regulates Prostate Cancer Progression Through NRBP1/miR-497-5p Axis.', 'Circulating Extracellular Vesicles: Their Role in Patients with Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA) Undergoing EndoVascular Aortic Repair (EVAR).', 'Extracellular vesicles: A potential future strategy for dental and maxillofacial tissue repair and regeneration.']"""

The United States (US) Food and Drug Administration Adverse Events Reporting System (FAERS) is a post-market pharmacovigilance database valuable for adverse event (AE) assessments. We analyzed FAERS to identify disproportionate AE signals related to radium-223, and to explore radium-223's international utilization.  Materials and methods:   We identified 2182 radium-223 cases associated with AE(s) from 2013 to 2018. The duration of radium-223 therapy was calculated. Reporting odds ratio (ROR) and proportional reporting ratio (PRR), with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), were calculated for AEs of interest. ROR shows disproportionate signals if the lower limit of the 95% CI > 1. PRR shows disproportionate signals if PRR ≥ 2, χ2 statistic ≥ 4, and ≥ 3 AEs were reported. We identified any US Food and Drug Administration enforcement actions for radium-223.  Results:   A majority (60.8%) of events occurred outside the US. Among patients with radium-223-associated AEs, the median therapy duration was only 56 days (corresponding to 2-3 treatment cycles).

Although the generation of aberrant SVs (e.g. AR-v7/sst5TMD4/etc.) is associated to prostate-cancer (PCa) aggressiveness and/or castration-resistant PCa (CRPC) development, whether the molecular reason behind such phenomena might be linked to a dysregulation of the cellular machinery responsible for the splicing process [spliceosome-components (SCs) and splicing-factors (SFs)] has not been yet explored.  Methods:   Expression levels of 43 key SCs and SFs were measured in two cohorts of PCa-samples: 1) Clinically-localized formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded PCa-samples (n = 84), and 2) highly-aggressive freshly-obtained PCa-samples (n = 42).  Findings:   A profound dysregulation in the expression of multiple components of the splicing machinery (i.e. 7 SCs/19 SFs) were found in PCa compared to their non-tumor adjacent-regions. Notably, overexpression of SNRNP200, SRSF3 and SRRM1 (mRNA and/or protein) were associated with relevant clinical (e.g. Gleason score, T-Stage, metastasis, biochemical recurrence, etc.) and molecular (e.g. AR-v7 expression) parameters of aggressiveness in PCa-samples. Functional (cell-proliferation/migration) and mechanistic [gene-expression (qPCR) and protein-levels (western-blot)] assays were performed in normal prostate cells (PNT2) and PCa-cells (LNCaP/22Rv1/PC-3/DU145 cell-lines) in response to SNRNP200, SRSF3 and/or SRRM1 silencing (using specific siRNAs) revealed an overall decrease in proliferation/migration-rate in PCa-cells through the modulation of key oncogenic SVs expression levels (e.g. AR-v7/PKM2/XBP1s) and alteration of oncogenic signaling pathways (e.g. p-AKT/p-JNK).  Interpretation:   These results demonstrate that the spliceosome is drastically altered in PCa wherein SNRNP200, SRSF3 and SRRM1 could represent attractive novel diagnostic/prognostic and therapeutic targets for PCa and CRPC.""","""['Juan M Jiménez-Vacas', 'Vicente Herrero-Aguayo', 'Antonio J Montero-Hidalgo', 'Enrique Gómez-Gómez', 'Antonio C Fuentes-Fayos', 'Antonio J León-González', 'Prudencio Sáez-Martínez', 'Emilia Alors-Pérez', 'Sergio Pedraza-Arévalo', 'Teresa González-Serrano', 'Oscar Reyes', 'Ana Martínez-López', 'Rafael Sánchez-Sánchez', 'Sebastián Ventura', 'Elena M Yubero-Serrano', 'María J Requena-Tapia', 'Justo P Castaño', 'Manuel D Gahete', 'Raúl M Luque']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""EBioMedicine""","""['Spliceosome component SF3B1 as novel prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target for prostate cancer.', 'Splicing machinery dysregulation drives glioblastoma development/aggressiveness: oncogenic role of SRSF3.', 'The oncogenic role of the spliced somatostatin receptor sst5TMD4 variant in prostate cancer.', 'Dysregulation of splicing variants and spliceosome components in breast cancer.', 'Splicing Factors Have an Essential Role in Prostate Cancer Progression and Androgen Receptor Signaling.', 'CDC20 Is Regulated by the Histone Methyltransferase, KMT5A, in Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Metformin and simvastatin exert additive antitumour effects in glioblastoma via senescence-state: clinical and translational evidence.', 'Clinical and molecular significance of the RNA m6A methyltransferase complex in prostate cancer.', ""Bioinformatics and Connectivity Map Analysis Suggest Viral Infection as a Critical Causative Factor of Hashimoto's Thyroiditis."", 'MARVEL: an integrated alternative splicing analysis platform for single-cell RNA sequencing data.']"""

Methods:   We retrospectively assessed 25 18F-PSMA-1007 PET/CT scans with both OSEM and Q.Clear reconstructions available. Each scan was independently reported by two physicians both in OSEM and Q.Clear. SUVmax, SUVmean and tumour-to-background ratio (TBR) of each lesion were measured. Reports were also compared for their final conclusions and the number and localisation of lesions.  Results:   In both reconstructions the same 87 lesions were reported. Mean SUVmax, SUVmean and TBR were higher for Q.Clear than OSEM (7.01 vs 6.53 [p = 0.052], 4.16 vs 3.84 [p = 0.036] and 20.2 vs 16.8 [p < 0.00001], respectively).

For lesions ≥ 10 mm, no significant differences were observed. Findings with higher tracer avidity (SUVmax ≥ 5) tended to have higher SUVmax, SUVmean and TBR values in Q.Clear (11.6 vs 10.3 [p = 0.00278], 7.0 vs 6.7 [p = 0.077] and 33.9 vs 26.7 [p < 0.00001, respectively).

But, the role and importance of DNAJC10 gene in breast cancer is currently unknown. In this study, in vitro/in vivo expression, biomarker potential and genetic/epigenetic alterations of DNAJC10 were analyzed in breast cancer.  Methods:   Real-time qRT-PCR and immunohistochemistry methods were used to determine the expression level of DNAJC10 gene in breast cancer cell lines and clinical samples. The Kaplan-Meier plotter was used to evaluate the survival prognostic value of DNAJC10 mRNA expression in breast cancer patients. Mutation screening software and methylation-specific PCR were used to screen genetic alterations and methylation status of DNAJC10 promoter regions, respectively.  Results:   DNAJC10 mRNA expression was significantly reduced in 3 out of 4 breast cancer cell lines compared to the nontumorigenic mammary epithelial cell line (MCF 10A). DNAJC10 protein expression was significantly less frequent in invasive ductal carcinoma samples (n = 121) compared with adjacent normal breast tissues (n = 32) (p < 0.0001). Downregulation of DNAJC10 mRNA was associated with poor overall survival (OS) (n = 626) (p = 0.0096) and relapse-free survival (n = 1764) (p = 5.3e-12). According to the COSMIC and cBioPortal databases, point mutations and copy number variations of DNAJC10 were very rare in breast cancer samples. Besides, no genetic alterations on the experimentally validated promoter regions were found in breast cell lines. CpG island located in the promoter regions of DNAJC10 gene was found to be frequently hypomethylated in breast cell lines.  Conclusions:   In the light of previous knowledge regarding the role of DNAJC10 in carcinogenesis, findings of this study suggest that DNAJC10 is a potential diagnostic/prognostic biomarker and tumor suppressor candidate for breast cancer.

Furthermore, this polymorphism may be responsible for the ethnic variation observed in prostate cancer occurrence and expression of the ERG oncogene. We investigate the expression of AR and ERG in the biopsies of Malaysian men with prostate cancer and in the same patients relate this to the length of the CAG repeat sequence in their AR gene.  Materials and methods:   From a PSA screening initiative, 161 men were shown to have elevated PSA levels in their blood and underwent prostatic tissue biopsy. DNA was extracted from the blood, and exon 1 of the AR gene amplified by PCR and sequenced. The number of CAG repeat sequences were counted and compared to the immunohistochemical expression of ERG and AR in the matched tumour biopsies.  Results:   Of men with elevated PSA, 89 were diagnosed with prostate cancer, and 72 with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). There was no significant difference in the length of the CAG repeat in men with prostate cancer and BPH. The CAG repeat length was not associated with; age, PSA or tumour grade, though a longer CAG repeat was associated with tumour stage. ERG and AR were expressed in 36% and 86% of the cancers, respectively. There was no significant association between CAG repeat length and ERG or AR expression. However, there was a significant inverse relationship between ERG and AR expression. In addition, a significantly great proportion of Indian men had ERG positive tumours, compared to men of Malay or Chinese descent.  Conclusions:   CAG repeat length is not associated with prostate cancer or expression of ERG or AR.

We investigated two different epigenetic modulating drugs, SP-2509 and JQ1, that target histone lysine demethylase 1 (LSD1), and bromodomain-containing protein (BRD), respectively and their combined effect in three different prostate cancer (PCa) types: 1) androgen receptor (AR)-positive and androgen-sensitive; 2) AR-positive but castration-resistant; and 3) androgen-nonresponsive. We found combined treatment provided a synergistic growth inhibition in castration-resistant PCa cells but knockdown of AR reduced sensitivity to both inhibitors in these cells. In the androgen-sensitive cell lines, AR knockdown attenuated sensitivity to the LSD1 inhibitor but not the JQ1 inhibitor. Strikingly, treatment with SP-2509 slightly, and JQ1 markedly increased invasion in PCa cells with high AR expression but decreased invasion in PCa cells with low/negative AR expression. Our results suggest that these two epigenetic drugs are novel and promising compounds for the development of PCa therapeutics, particularly for castration-resistant disease.

Compared to Akt1s1+/+ mice, hepatocarcinogenesis was suppressed in Akt1s1-/- mice, and the activation of Akt was impaired. PRAS40 depletion resulted in the inhibition of HCC cellular proliferation. Tumor suppressor miR-124-3p was found to downregulate PRAS40 expression by targeting its 3'UTR. MiR-124-3p levels were inversely correlated to PRAS40 protein and phosphorylation levels in HCC specimens. The proliferation inhibition by miR-124-3p mimics was partially reversed by exogenous PRAS40 introduction in HCC cells.  Interpretation:   PRAS40 hyperexpression induced by loss of miR-124-3p contributes to PRAS40 hyperphosphorylation and hepatocarcinogenesis.

As an important drug, flutamide has been used in the clinical diagnosis of prostate cancer. However, the over dosage and improper discharge of flutamide could affect the living organism. Thus, it necessary to develop the sensor for detection of flutamide with highly sensitivity. In this paper, we report the synthesis of lanthanum cobaltite decorated halloysite nanotube (LCO/HNT) nanocomposite prepared by a facile method and evaluated for selective reduction of flutamide. The as-prepared LCO/HNT nanocomposite shows the best catalytic performance towards detection of flutamide, when compared to other bare and modified electrodes. The good electrochemical performance of the LCO/HNT nanocomposite modified electrode is ascribed to abundant active sites, large specific surface area and their synergetic effects. Furthermore, the LCO/HNT modified electrode exhibits low detection limit (0.002 μM), wide working range (0.009-145 μM) and excellent selectivity with remarkable stability.

Methods and materials:   Clinical and pathological characteristics of octogerians treated with docetaxel were collected retrospectively from 3 French centers from 2009 to 2019. Patient's outcome, treatments administered before and/or after docetaxel were also analyzed.  Results:   Data of 89 patients could be analyzed. A total of 20.2 % of patients received the standard regimen and 79.8 % received an adapted one. Patients in the adapted group were significantly older than in standard one. Other patient's characteristics - including the geriatric scales - were similar. Dose reductions for toxicity were more frequent in the standard group (P=0.04). The median overall survival of the total population was 13.3 months. It was longer in the standard group than in the adapted group (26.1 months vs 12.4 months=0.01). In multivariate analysis, the type of docetaxel regimen (standard versus adapted) was an independent predictor of survival.

In an attempt to find the best condition for PSMA radioligand therapy in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) patients, we evaluated the effect of oral enzalutamide in patients, predominantly having previously progressed on enzalutamide treatment.  Methods:   Ten patients with advanced mCRPC scheduled for PSMA radioligand therapy were examined with 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT before and after a mean of 11.8 days of enzalutamide 160 mg/day. Imaging results were compared using total PSMA tumor burden quantification. We assessed whole-body total lesion PSMA (TLP), defined as SUVmean × tumor volume and calculated TLP-to-liver ratio (TLP-LR), TLP-to-parotid gland ratio (TLP-PR), and TLP-to-kidney ratio (TLP-KR).  Results:   The mean (median) increase of TLP-LR, TLP-PR, and TLP-KR in the cohort was 49.3% (38.8%), 45.1% (23.5%), and 54.9% (37.6%), respectively. These increases were statistically significant (p = 0.002, p = 0.014, and p = 0.014), while PSA values did not change significantly (p = 0.846). Seven of the 10 patients had previously undergone enzalutamide treatment with eventual progression, formally classified as treatment failure. No side effects were noted in the short term.  Conclusions:   Our results suggest that enzalutamide could be considered as a PSMA radioligand treatment enhancing primer medication, which may increase PSMA expression by a dimension of 50% in mCRPC. The effect was shown even in patients having previously failed enzalutamide treatment for arrest of progression in the mCRPC setting.

Methods:   This is a single-institution, matched case-control analysis of short-term clinical outcomes stratified by pathologic tumor location at radical prostatectomy. Pathologic data extracted by expert genitourinary pathologists on tumor location was linked to clinical and oncologic outcomes data from a prospective institutional database for analysis.  Results:   From 2005 to 2013, 1580 patients were identified for analysis with 150 (9.5%) having APCA. One-hundred and thirty two of these APCA men had complete clinical data and were matched to 353 men with PPCA (~1:3 ratio) by GrdGrp at surgery, margin status, and pathologic T stage. There were no racial/ethnic differences between APCA and PPCA (p = 0.13). Men with APCA demonstrated a higher median PSA at diagnosis (6.4 [4.6-9.1] ng/mL vs 5.6 [4.4-8.1] ng/mL; p = 0.04), a higher rate of GrdGrp 1 disease at diagnosis (57.7% vs. 40.0%, p = 0.003), and lower rates of abnormal digital rectal examination (DRE) (10.1% vs. 23.2%, p = 0.003) when compared to PPCA.

P-Rex1 has also become increasingly recognized for its role in promoting metastasis of breast cancer, prostate cancer, and melanoma. Recent structural, biochemical, and biologic work has shown that binding of PIP3 to the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain of P-Rex1 is required for its activation in cells. Here, differential scanning fluorimetry was used in a medium-throughput screen to identify six small molecules that interact with the P-Rex1 PH domain and block binding of and activation by PIP3 Three of these compounds inhibit N-formylmethionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine induced spreading of human neutrophils as well as activation of the GTPase Rac2, both of which are downstream effects of P-Rex1 activity. Furthermore, one of these compounds reduces neutrophil velocity and inhibits neutrophil recruitment in response to inflammation in a zebrafish model. These results suggest that the PH domain of P-Rex1 is a tractable drug target and that these compounds might be useful for inhibiting P-Rex1 in other experimental contexts.

Decreased DRAIC expression predicts poor patient outcome in prostate and seven other cancers, while increased DRAIC represses growth of xenografted tumors. Here, we show that cancers with decreased DRAIC expression have increased NF-κB target gene expression. DRAIC downregulation increased cell invasion and soft agar colony formation; this was dependent on NF-κB activation. DRAIC interacted with subunits of the IκB kinase (IKK) complex to inhibit their interaction with each other, the phosphorylation of IκBα, and the activation of NF-κB. These functions of DRAIC mapped to the same fragment containing bases 701-905. Thus, DRAIC lncRNA inhibits prostate cancer progression through suppression of NF-κB activation by interfering with IKK activity.

Furthermore, VPS9D1-AS1/MEF2D could sponge with miR-4739. VPS9D1-AS1/MEF2D and miR-4739 were inversely correlated in tumor cells. And the expression of miR-4739 is markedly downregulated in PCa, meanwhile, that of MEF2D exhibited the opposite tendency. However, MEF2D was positively regulated by VPS9D1-AS1. Moreover, MEF2D upregulation offset the suppressive effects of VPS9D1-AS1 deficiency on cell proliferation, migration and invasion in PCa. Additionally, ZEB1 contained the binding sites of VPS9D1-AS1 promoter, and there existed positive relation between them. Taken together, above results illustrated that ZEB1 activated-VPS9D1-AS1 promotes the tumorigenesis and progression of PCa by sponging miR-4739 to upregulate MEF2D, which offering a new useful reference for studying the development process of PCa.""","""['Xiaobin Wang', 'Qiangjun Chen', 'Xi Wang', 'Wensheng Li', 'Guoqiang Yu', 'Zhiyi Zhu', 'Weitao Zhang']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Biomed Pharmacother""","""['Downregulation of lncRNA ZEB1-AS1 Represses Cell Proliferation, Migration, and Invasion Through Mediating PI3K/AKT/mTOR Signaling by miR-342-3p/CUL4B Axis in Prostate Cancer.', 'LncRNA ADPGK-AS1 promotes pancreatic cancer progression through activating ZEB1-mediated epithelial-mesenchymal transition.', 'Long noncoding RNA ZEB1-AS1 epigenetically regulates the expressions of ZEB1 and downstream molecules in prostate cancer.', 'A review on the role of ZEB1-AS1 in human disorders.', 'Extracellular vesicles promote esophageal cancer progression by delivering lncZEB1-AS1 between cells.', 'miR-4739 promotes epithelial-mesenchymal transition and angiogenesis in ""driver gene-negative"" non-small cell lung cancer via activating the Wnt/β-catenin signaling.', 'Long non-coding RNA MYU promotes ovarian cancer cell proliferation by sponging miR-6827-5p and upregulating HMGA1.', 'Spermine synthase (SMS) serves as a prognostic biomarker in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma: a bioinformatics analysis.', 'VPS9D1-AS1 overexpression amplifies intratumoral TGF-β signaling and promotes tumor cell escape from CD8+ T cell killing in colorectal cancer.', 'LINC00511 aggravates the malignancy of lung adenocarcinoma through sponging microRNA miR-4739 to regulate pyrroline-5-carboxylate reductase 1 expression.']"""

However, potential effects of ADT treatment on neurocognitive dysfunction remain unclear. The present study was conducted to assess the relation between ADT treatment and risk of cognitive decline in Asian men with PC.  Methods:   A population-based cohort of 24,464 men with PC, each newly diagnosed between 2000 and 2008, was selected from the Taiwan National Health Insurance Database. Subjects were further grouped by treatment as non-ADT (n = 4685) or ADT (n = 12,740), members of the latter subjected to bilateral orchiectomy or medical treatment (ie, luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonists, antiandrogens, or combination therapy). A multivariable Cox proportional hazard model with ADT as time-dependent covariate was used to generate adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) of subsequent cognitive decline, including dementia, Alzheimer's disease (AD), and Parkinson's disease (PD).  Results:   ADT showed a significant association with overall risk of cognitive decline (HR = 1.51, 95 % CI: 1.31-1.74), especially for PD, dementia, and non-Alzheimer dementia (non-AZD). When stratified by various ADT regimens, antiandrogen-only recipients displayed significantly heightened risks of subsequent AD, non-AZD, and PD. However, combined androgen blockade also imposed an increased risk of PD. There was no apparent correlation between duration of ADT exposure and cognitive dysfunction.  Conclusions:   Various ADT therapies may have disparate impacts on cognitive function. Prospective studies exploring pertinent clinical characteristics more fully are needed to confirm these findings.""","""['Jian-Hua Hong', 'Chao-Yuan Huang', 'Chao-Hsiang Chang', 'Chih-Hsin Muo', 'Fu-Shan Jaw', 'Yu-Chuan Lu', 'Chi-Jung Chung']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Cancer Epidemiol""","""['Androgen deprivation increases the risk of fracture in prostate cancer patients: a population-based study in Chinese patients.', 'Type of Androgen Deprivation Therapy and Risk of Dementia Among Patients With Prostate Cancer in Taiwan.', 'No increased risk of dementia in patients receiving androgen deprivation therapy for prostate cancer: a 5-year follow-up study.', 'Degarelix versus luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonists for the treatment of prostate cancer.', 'Stroke related to androgen deprivation therapy for prostate cancer: a meta-analysis and systematic review.', 'A Systematic Review on the Potential Acceleration of Neurocognitive Aging in Older Cancer Survivors.', ""Testosterone and Alzheimer's disease."", 'The Insignificant Correlation between Androgen Deprivation Therapy and Incidence of Dementia Using an Extension Survival Cox Hazard Model and Propensity-Score Matching Analysis in a Retrospective, Population-Based Prostate Cancer Registry.', 'Assessment and Management of Cognitive Function in Patients with Prostate Cancer Treated with Second-Generation Androgen Receptor Pathway Inhibitors.', 'Androgen-deprivation therapy and cognitive decline in the NEON-PC prospective study during the COVID-19 pandemic.']"""

Objectives:   To validate the self-reported perception of proximity to industrial facilities.  Methods:   MCC-Spain is a population-based multicase-control study of cancer in Spain that recruited incident cases of breast, colorectal, prostate, and stomach cancer. The participant's current residence and the location of the industries were geocoded, and the linear distance between them was calculated (gold standard). The epidemiological questionnaire included a question to determine whether the participants perceived the presence of any industry at ≤1 km from their residences. Sensitivity and specificity of individuals' perception of proximity to industries were estimated as measures of classification accuracy, and the area under the curve (AUC) and adjusted odds ratios (aORs) of misclassification were calculated as measures of discrimination. Analyses were performed for all cases and controls, and by tumor location, educational level, sex, industrial sector, and length of residence. Finally, aORs of cancer associated with real and self-reported distances were calculated to explore differences in the estimation of risk between these measures.  Results:   Sensitivity of the questionnaire was limited (0.48) whereas specificity was excellent (0.89). AUC was sufficient (0.68). Participants with breast (aOR(95%CI) = 2.03 (1.67;2.46)), colorectal (aOR(95%CI) = 1.41 (1.20;1.64)) and stomach (aOR(95%CI) = 1.59 (1.20;2.10)) cancer showed higher risk of misclassification than controls. This risk was higher for lower educational levels (aOR<primaryvs.university (95%CI) = 1.78 (1.44;2.20)), among younger participants (aOR22-54 yearsvs. 73-85 years (95%CI) = 1.32 (1.09;1.60)), and for some industrial sectors: pharmaceutical (aOR(95%CI) = 29.02 (19.52;43.14)), galvanization (aOR(95%CI) = 14.14 (6.78;29.47)), and ceramic (aOR(95%CI) = 12.73 (7.22;22.44)). Participants living ≤1 year in the study area showed a lower risk of misclassification ((aOR≤1vs.>15 years (95%CI) = 0.56 (0.36;0.85)). The use of self-reported proximity vs. real distance to industrial facilities biased the effect on cancer risk towards the nullity.  Conclusions:   Self-reported distance to industrial facilities can be a useful tool for hypothesis generation, but hypothesis-testing studies should use real distance to report valid conclusions. The sensitivity of the question might be improved with a more specific formulation.""","""['Adela Castelló', 'Beatriz Pérez-Gómez', 'David Lora-Pablos', 'Virginia Lope', 'Gemma Castaño-Vinyals', 'Facundo Vitelli-Storelli', 'Trinidad Dierssen-Sotos', 'Pilar Amiano', 'Marcela Guevara', 'Víctor Moreno', 'Macarena Lozano-Lorca', 'Adonina Tardón', 'Juan Alguacil', 'Marta Hernández-García', 'Rafael Marcos-Gragera', 'Maria Dolores Chirlaque López', 'Eva Ardanaz', 'Jesús Ibarluzea', 'Inés Gómez-Acebo', 'Antonio J Molina', ""Cristina O'Callaghan-Gordo"", 'Nuria Aragonés', 'Manolis Kogevinas', 'Marina Pollán', 'Javier García-Pérez']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Environ Int""","""['Residential proximity to industrial pollution sources and colorectal cancer risk: A multicase-control study (MCC-Spain).', 'Risk of gastric cancer in the environs of industrial facilities in the MCC-Spain study.', 'Risk of breast cancer and residential proximity to industrial installations: New findings from a multicase-control study (MCC-Spain).', 'Diagnostic test accuracy of nutritional tools used to identify undernutrition in patients with colorectal cancer: a systematic review.', 'Environmental and individual exposure and the risk of congenital anomalies: a review of recent epidemiological evidence.']"""

This study aims to characterize the role of GAS5 rs145204276 and HOTAIR rs4759314 polymorphisms in the pathogenesis of PC. Both INS allele of GAS5 rs145204276 and A allele of HOTAIR rs4759314 were identified to increase the survival of PC patients. And patients carrying DEL/DEL + AG genotypes tend to present higher levels of HMGB1, GAS5, HOTAIR and lower levels of miR-1284 and miR-22. In addition, the transcription activity of GAS5 promoter was increased by the deletion allele of rs145204276 polymorphism, while the G allele of rs4759314 polymorphism increased the transcription activity of HOTAIR promoter. GAS5 and HOTAIR could bind to miR-1284 and miR-22, respectively, while miR-1284 and miR-22 could bind to the 3'UTR of HMGB1. Compared with the control group, the expressions of miR-1284 or miR-22 were decreased with the presence of GAS5 or HOTAIR, and the expression of HMGB1 was the highest in the GAS5 + HOTAIR group.

Biochemical recurrence-free survival was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Cox hazard regression was used to predict biochemical recurrence.  Results:   According to the 7th edition subclassification, 141 patients (13.1%) had T2a, 43 (4.0%) had T2b, and 889 (82.9%) had T2c disease. The 7th edition subclassification did not differ significantly on Kaplan-Meier analysis (p = 0.502). Mean percent tumor volume was 8.7 ± 8.0% (interquartile range, 5-10%). Percent tumor volume was positively correlated with initial prostate-specific antigen, grade group, surgical margin, and T2 subclassification (all p < 0.001). The 7th edition subclassification was not a significant factor, whereas percent tumor volume was (hazard ratio, 1.023; 95% confidence interval, 1.005-1.041; p = 0.0128) on multivariate analysis. On Kaplan-Meier analysis, percent tumor volume (> 7.5% vs ≤ 7.5%) differed significantly for biochemical recurrence-free survival (p < 0.001).  Conclusions:   The 7th edition pathologic T2 subclassification had poor prognostic value for biochemical recurrence in our cohort. Elimination of the 8th edition subclassification was suitable. Percent tumor volume classified biochemical recurrence prognosis in pathologic T2 stage. Therefore, percent tumor volume can be a candidate factor for the next T2 subclassification.""","""['Se Young Choi', 'Byung Hoon Chi', 'Bumjin Lim', 'Yoon Soo Kyung', 'Dalsan You', 'In Gab Jeong', 'Cheryn Song', 'Jun Hyuk Hong', 'Hanjong Ahn', 'Choung-Soo Kim']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""J Cancer Res Clin Oncol""","""['Independent Validation of the American Joint Committee on Cancer 8th Edition Prostate Cancer Staging Classification.', 'Should pathologists continue to use the current pT2 substaging system for reporting of radical prostatectomy specimens?', 'The prognostic role of the pathological T2 subclassification for prostate cancer in the 2002 Tumour-Nodes-Metastasis staging system.', 'Evolution in Prostate Cancer Staging: Pathology Updates From AJCC 8th Edition and Opportunities That Remain.', 'Subserosal vascular density predicts oncological features of T2 gallbladder cancer.', 'Detection of recurrence sites using 18F-fluorocholine PET/CT in prostate cancer patients with PSA failure.', 'The direct prognosis comparison of 125I low-dose-rate brachytherapy versus laparoscopic radical prostatectomy for patients with intermediate-risk prostate cancer.', 'Comparison of the Oncological and Functional Outcomes of Brachytherapy and Radical Prostatectomy for Localized Prostate Cancer.', 'Can Tumour Volume Percentage in Radical Prostatectomy Predict Cancer Biochemical Recurrence?

Prostate cancer is characterized by relatively low numbers of mutations, and, in contrast to many other common epithelial cancers, commercially available single nucleotide mutation assays for quantification of ctDNA are insufficient for therapy assessment in this disease. However, prostate cancer shares some similarity with translocation-affected mesenchymal tumors (e.g., leukemia and Ewing sarcoma), which are common in pediatric oncology, where chromosomal translocations are used as biomarkers for quantification of the tumor burden. Approximately 50% of prostate cancers carry a chromosomal translocation resulting in generation of the TMPRSS2-ERG fusion gene, which is unique to the tumor cells of each individual patient because of variability in the fusion breakpoint sites. In the present study, we examined the structural preconditions for TMPRSS2-ERG fusion sites in comparison with mesenchymal tumors in pediatric patients to determine whether the sequence composition is suitable for the establishment of tumor-specific quantification assays in prostate cancer patients. Genomic repeat elements represent potential obstacles to establishment of quantification assays, and we found similar proportions of repeat elements at fusion sites in prostate cancer to those reported for mesenchymal tumors, where genomic fusion sequences are established as biomarkers. Our data support the development of the TMPRSS2-ERG fusion gene as a noninvasive tumor marker for therapy assessment, risk stratification, and relapse detection to improve personalized therapy strategies for patients with prostate cancer.""","""['Manuela Krumbholz', 'Abbas Agaimy', 'Robert Stoehr', 'Maximilian Burger', 'Sven Wach', 'Helge Taubert', 'Bernd Wullich', 'Arndt Hartmann', 'Markus Metzler']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Dis Markers""","""['TMPRSS2:ERG gene fusion expression regulates bone markers and enhances the osteoblastic phenotype of prostate cancer bone metastases.', 'Expression of steroid and peptide hormone receptors, metabolic enzymes and EMT-related genes in prostate tumors in relation to the presence of the TMPRSS2/ERG fusion.', 'Rapid and Sensitive Fusion Gene Detection in Prostate Cancer Urinary Specimens by Label-Free Surface-enhanced Raman Scattering.', 'TMPRSS2-ERG gene fusion in prostate cancer.', 'The prognostic and predictive value of TMPRSS2-ERG gene fusion and ERG protein expression in prostate cancer biopsies.', 'Genomic Breakpoint Characterization and Transcriptome Analysis of Metastatic, Recurrent Desmoplastic Small Round Cell Tumor.', 'Aquaporins as Prognostic Biomarker in Prostate Cancer.', 'The Expression of Proto-Oncogene ETS-Related Gene (ERG) Plays a Central Role in the Oncogenic Mechanism Involved in the Development and Progression of Prostate Cancer.', 'Blood-Derived Biomarkers of Diagnosis, Prognosis and Therapy Response in Prostate Cancer Patients.', 'Dysregulation of Type II Transmembrane Serine Proteases and Ligand-Dependent Activation of MET in Urological Cancers.']"""

We previously showed that more variable telomere lengths among cancer cells and shorter telomere lengths in cancer-associated stromal (CAS) cells individually and together (""telomere biomarker"") are associated with prostate cancer-related death in surgically treated men independent of currently used prognostic indicators. Here, we hypothesize that Black-White differences in the telomere biomarker and/or in its components may help explain the racial disparity in prostate cancer outcomes.  Methods:   Black [higher grade (Gleason ≥4+3) = 34 and lower grade = 93] and White (higher grade = 34 and lower grade = 89) surgically treated men were frequency matched on age, pathologic stage, and grade. We measured telomere lengths in cancer and CAS cells using a robust telomere-specific FISH assay. Tissue microarray and grade-specific distributional cutoff points without regard to race were evaluated.  Results:   Among men with higher grade disease, the proportion of Black men (47.1%) with more variable cancer cell telomere lengths was 2.3-times higher (P = 0.02) than that in White men (20.6%). In contrast, among men with lower grade disease, cancer cell telomere length variability did not differ by race.

Unlike several other types of cancer, PCa has few genetic drivers, which has led researchers to look for additional epigenetic and transcriptomic contributors to PCa development and progression. Especially datasets on DNA methylation, the most commonly studied epigenetic marker, have recently been measured and analysed in several PCa patient cohorts. DNA methylation is most commonly associated with downregulation of gene expression. However, positive associations of DNA methylation to gene expression have also been reported, suggesting a more diverse mechanism of epigenetic regulation. Such additional complexity could have important implications for understanding prostate cancer development but has not been studied at a genome-wide scale.  Results:   In this study, we have compared three sets of genome-wide single-site DNA methylation data from 870 PCa and normal tissue samples with multi-cohort gene expression data from 1117 samples, including 532 samples where DNA methylation and gene expression have been measured on the exact same samples. Genes were classified according to their corresponding methylation and expression profiles. A large group of hypermethylated genes was robustly associated with increased gene expression (UPUP group) in all three methylation datasets. These genes demonstrated distinct patterns of correlation between DNA methylation and gene expression compared to the genes showing the canonical negative association between methylation and expression (UPDOWN group). This indicates a more diversified role of DNA methylation in regulating gene expression than previously appreciated. Moreover, UPUP and UPDOWN genes were associated with different compartments - UPUP genes were related to the structures in nucleus, while UPDOWN genes were linked to extracellular features.  Conclusion:   We identified a robust association between hypermethylation and upregulation of gene expression when comparing samples from prostate cancer and normal tissue. These results challenge the classical view where DNA methylation is always associated with suppression of gene expression, which underlines the importance of considering corresponding expression data when assessing the downstream regulatory effect of DNA methylation.""","""['Ieva Rauluseviciute', 'Finn Drabløs', 'Morten Beck Rye']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""BMC Med Genomics""","""['Epigenomic profiling of DNA methylation in paired prostate cancer versus adjacent benign tissue.', 'Association of DSC3 mRNA down-regulation in prostate cancer with promoter hypermethylation and poor prognosis.', 'Genome-wide analysis of DNA methylation in prostate cancer using the technology of Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip (HM450).', 'The expanding role of epigenetics in the development, diagnosis and treatment of prostate cancer and benign prostatic hyperplasia.', 'The importance of DNA methylation in prostate cancer development.', 'A role for SETD2 loss in tumorigenesis through DNA methylation dysregulation.', 'A synthetic glycodendropeptide induces methylation changes on regulatory T cells linked to tolerant responses in anaphylactic-mice.', ""Upregulation of extracellular proteins in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease."", 'Transgressive and parental dominant gene expression and cytosine methylation during seed development in Brassica napus hybrids.', 'The epigenetic function of androgen receptor in prostate cancer progression.']"""

However, when the damage is too severe, the cells typically are forced into apoptosis, and the contribution of TLKs in this process has not been investigated. In contrast, it is known that Nek1 may play a role by phosphorylating VDAC1 maintaining proper opening and closure of the channel and thus mitochondrial integrity. We now show that the activating phosphorylation of Nek1-T141 by TLK1 contributes to the phosphorylation and stability of VDAC1 and thereby to mitochondrial permeability and integrity. Treatment of three different cell lines model that overexpress Nek1-T141A mutant with doxorubicin showed exquisite sensitivity to the drug, with implementation of rapid accumulation of cells with subG1 DNA content (apoptotic) and other alterations in the cell cycle. In addition, these cells displayed reduced oxygen consumption under normal conditions and less reliance on mitochondria and more dependence on glycolysis for energy production. Consistent with greater apoptosis, upon treatment with low doses of doxorubicin, cells overexpressing Nek1-T141A displayed leakage of Cyt-C into the cytoplasmic fraction. This suggests that inhibiting the TLK1/Nek1/VDAC1 nexus could sensitize cancer cells to apoptotic killing in combination with an appropriate DNA damaging agent.

Examination of cancer genomic datasets revealed that PTEN is expressed at lower levels in PTEN-deleted tumor samples than in normal solid tissue samples.

Few studies have evaluated the effect of coffee drinking on telomere length, a biomarker of chromosomal integrity, and results have been inconsistent. Understanding this association may provide mechanistic insight into associations of coffee with health. The aim of our study was to test the hypothesis that heavier coffee intake is associated with greater likelihood of having above-median telomere length. We evaluated the cross-sectional association between coffee intake and relative telomere length using data from 1,638 controls from four previously conducted case-control studies nested in the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial. Coffee intake was assessed using a food frequency questionnaire, and relative telomere length was measured from buffy-coat, blood, or buccal cells. We used unconditional logistic regression models to generate multivariable-adjusted, study-specific odds ratios for the association between coffee intake and relative telomere length. We then conducted a random-effects meta-analysis to determine summary odds ratios. We found that neither summary continuous (OR = 1.01, 95% CI = 0.99-1.03) nor categorical (OR <3 cups/day vs. none = 1.37, 95% CI = 0.71-2.65; OR ≥3 cups/day vs. none = 1.47, 95% CI = 0.81-2.66) odds ratio estimates of coffee drinking and relative telomere length were statistically significant. However, in the largest of the four contributing studies, moderate (<3 cups/day) and heavy coffee drinkers (≥3 cups/day) were 2.10 times (95% CI = 1.25, 3.54) and 1.93 times as likely (95% CI = 1.17, 3.18) as nondrinkers to have above-median telomere length, respectively.

To more directly test this, mice deficient in Olfr-78 were administered with DSS in water for 7 days and were found to have increased expression of IL-1β and inflammatory signs in colon compared with control mice. Next, we explored the expression of its human counterpart olfactory receptor family 51, subfamily E, member 2 (OR51E2) in human intestinal samples and observed that it was in fact also expressed in human colon samples. RNA sequence analysis revealed significant changes in the genes involved in infection, immunity, inflammation, and colorectal cancer between wild-type and Olfr-78 knockout mice. Collectively, our findings show that Olfr-78 is highly expressed in colon and downregulated in DSS- and TNBS-induced colitis, and DSS-treated Olfr-78 null mice had increased colonic expression of cytokine RNA levels, suggesting a potential role for this receptor in intestinal inflammation. Future investigations are needed to understand how Olfr-78/OR51E2 in both mouse and human intestine modulates gastrointestinal pathophysiology.""","""['Kumar Kotlo', 'Arivarasu N Anbazhagan', 'Shubha Priyamvada', 'Dulari Jayawardena', 'Anoop Kumar', 'Yang Chen', 'Yinglin Xia', 'Patricia W Finn', 'David L Perkins', 'Pradeep K Dudeja', 'Brian T Layden']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Am J Physiol Cell Physiol""","""['MicroRNA 301A Promotes Intestinal Inflammation and Colitis-Associated Cancer Development by Inhibiting BTG1.', 'Disruption of GPR35 Exacerbates Dextran Sulfate Sodium-Induced Colitis in Mice.', 'Deficiency of Nuclear Receptor Nur77 Aggravates Mouse Experimental Colitis by Increased NFκB Activity in Macrophages.', 'White and dark kidney beans reduce colonic mucosal damage and inflammation in response to dextran sodium sulfate.', 'Activation of Free Fatty Acid Receptor 4 Affects Intestinal Inflammation and Improves Colon Permeability in Mice.', 'The reduced SCFA-producing gut microbes are involved in the inflammatory activation in Kawasaki disease.', 'The olfactory Olfr-78/51E2 receptor interacts with the adenosine A2A receptor.

Cryoprotective agents (CPAs) have been used to restrain cryoinjury and improve cell survival, but some of these compounds pose greater risks for the clinical application of cryopreserved cells due to their inherent toxicity. Trehalose is known for its unique physicochemical properties and its interaction with the phospholipids of the plasma membrane, which can reduce cell osmotic stress and stabilized the cryopreserved cells. Nonetheless, there has been a shortage of relevant studies on the synthesis of trehalose-based CPAs. We hereby report the synthesis and evaluation of a trehalose-based polymer and hydrogel and its use as a cryoprotectant and three-dimensional (3D) cell scaffold for cell encapsulation and organoid production. In vitro cytotoxicity studies with the trehalose-based polymers (poly(Tre-ECH)) demonstrated biocompatibility up to 100 mg/mL. High post-thaw cell membrane integrity and post-thaw cell plating efficiencies were achieved after 24 h of incubation with skin fibroblast, HeLa (cervical), and PC3 (prostate) cancer cell lines under both controlled-rate and ultrarapid freezing protocols. Differential scanning calorimetry and a splat cooling assay for the determination of ice recrystallization inhibition activity corroborated the unique properties of these trehalose-based polyethers as cryoprotectants. Furthermore, the ability to form hydrogels as 3D cell scaffolds encourages the use of these novel polymers in the development of cell organoids and cryopreservation platforms.""","""['Diana Diaz-Dussan', 'Yi-Yang Peng', 'Jayeeta Sengupta', 'Rebecca Zabludowski', 'Madeleine K Adam', 'Jason P Acker', 'Robert N Ben', 'Piyush Kumar', 'Ravin Narain']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Biomacromolecules""","""['Correction to ""Trehalose-Based Polyethers for Cryopreservation and 3D Cell Scaffolds"".', 'Natural cryoprotectants combinations of l-proline and trehalose for red blood cells cryopreservation.', 'Cryopreservation of rabbit semen: comparing the effects of different cryoprotectants, cryoprotectant-free vitrification, and the use of albumin plus osmoprotectants on sperm survival and fertility after standard vapor freezing and vitrification.', 'Trehalose in Biomedical Cryopreservation-Properties, Mechanisms, Delivery Methods, Applications, Benefits, and Problems.', 'Cold-Responsive Nanocapsules Enable the Sole-Cryoprotectant-Trehalose Cryopreservation of β Cell-Laden Hydrogels for Diabetes Treatment.', 'Cryopreservation: Vitrification and Controlled Rate Cooling.', 'Advanced cryopreservation engineering strategies: the critical step to utilize stem cell products.', 'Design and Application of Hybrid Polymer-Protein Systems in Cancer Therapy.', 'Chemical approaches to cryopreservation.', 'Rediscovery of poly(ethylene glycol)s as a cryoprotectant for mesenchymal stem cells.', 'Cryostorage of Mesenchymal Stem Cells and Biomedical Cell-Based Products.']"""

The current study investigated the extent to which FCR among caregivers predicted their cancer screening behaviors years after their relatives' cancer diagnosis.  Methods:   A total of 813 caregivers (67% of whom were female, mean age of 56 years, and 92% non-Hispanic white) completed surveys 2 years (T1) and 8 years (T2) after their patients' cancer diagnosis. FCR, anxiety (Profile of Mood States-Short Form [POMS-SF]), and general mental health (Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey [MOS SF-36]) were reported at T1; caregivers' engagement in screening for colorectal, breast, and prostate cancers because of the patients' diagnoses were reported at T2.  Results:   Caregivers were found to engage in cancer screening at rates similar to those of the national average. Controlling for covariates, hierarchical logistic regression modeling for each type of cancer screening demonstrated that greater FCR was linearly related to a higher likelihood of undergoing colorectal cancer screening (odds ratio [OR], 1.15) and maintaining prostate cancer screening (OR, 1.34), but a lower likelihood of maintaining breast cancer screening in an age-appropriate manner (OR, 0.27). Examining curvilinear effects demonstrated that moderate levels of FCR were associated with a higher likelihood of maintaining age-appropriate colorectal cancer screening (OR, 1.48).  Conclusions:   The overall FCR among caregivers uniquely promotes their engagement in cancer screening behaviors. The role of caregivers' FCR in other types of cancer preventive behaviors and ways to channel FCR concerns into promoting healthy lifestyle behaviors should be investigated.""","""['Emi Takeuchi', 'Youngmee Kim', 'Kelly M Shaffer', 'Rachel S Cannady', 'Charles S Carver']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Cancer""","""['Medical, demographic and psychological correlates of fear of cancer recurrence (FCR) morbidity in breast, colorectal and melanoma cancer survivors with probable clinically significant FCR seeking psychological treatment through the ConquerFear study.', 'Assessing the relationship between fear of cancer recurrence and health care utilization in early-stage breast cancer survivors.', 'Fear of cancer recurrence and disease progression in long-term prostate cancer survivors after radical prostatectomy: A longitudinal study.', 'Fear of cancer recurrence and death anxiety.', 'A protocol for an updated and expanded systematic mixed studies review of fear of cancer recurrence in families and caregivers of adults diagnosed with cancer.', 'Understanding cancer genetic risk assessment motivations in a remote tailored risk communication and navigation intervention randomized controlled trial.', 'The Effect of Comfort Care on Postoperative Quality of Life, Psychological Status, and Satisfaction of Pancreatic Cancer Patients.', 'Understanding and Supporting Informal Cancer Caregivers.', ""The Correlation Between Radiotherapy and Patients' Fear of Cancer Recurrence: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis."", 'A Qualitative Focus Group Study for the Exploration of Knowledge and Attitudes of Informal Caregivers Toward Breast Cancer: Perceptions of Informal Caregivers and Healthcare Professionals in Three European Countries.']"""

The aim of this study was to create, develop, and externally validate a nomogram that predicts pathologic upgrade in patients on active surveillance (AS) for prostate cancer using commonly available clinical and multiparametric MRI (mpMRI) factors. MATERIALS AND METHODS. A consecutive sample of 300 patients undergoing AS for prostate cancer at the Keimyung University Dongsan Hospital between 2010 and 2016 was used to develop the nomogram. The validation cohort consisted of 150 patients undergoing active surveillance at Kyungpook National University Hospital between 2013 and 2017. The study outcome was the occurrence of pathologic upgrade in AS patients. The relationship between the clinical and mpMRI factors considered and pathologic upgrade was tested using univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses. The predictive accuracy of the nomogram was determined using the ROC AUC. RESULTS. The overall rate of pathologic upgrade was 25.0% in the developmental cohort and 22.0% in the validation cohort. Significant variables in the models were age, prostate-specific antigen level, biopsy grade group 2, baseline Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) scores of 4 and 5, positive cores on initial biopsy greater than 1, and biopsy cores with 50% or more tumor involvement. The progression seen on mpMRI of PI-RADS score was significantly associated with pathologic upgrade. The nomogram used to predict the risk of pathologic upgrade had a predictive accuracy of 0.78 in the external validation cohort. CONCLUSION. This study developed and externally validated a nomogram that predicts the risk of pathologic upgrade on the basis of commonly used factors.

Elevated prostate-specific antigen density (PSAD) based on transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) measurements has been shown to be strongly associated with clinically significant disease and to predict progression on active surveillance (AS) for men with disease that is at a low stage or grade. We hypothesized that elevated MRI PSAD is similarly associated with increased risk of progression on subsequent biopsy. MATERIALS AND METHODS. In this retrospective study, men with Gleason score of 3+3 on diagnostic TRUS-guided biopsy who were managed with AS, had undergone MRI, and had at least one additional biopsy were included. MRI PSAD was calculated using prostate volume on MRI and prostate-specific antigen level temporally closest to the MRI. Multivariable logistics regression models were used to evaluate the association between MRI PSAD and predictors of upgrade on serial biopsy. RESULTS. A total of 166 patients were identified, of whom 74 (44.6%) were upgraded to a Gleason score of 7 or higher on subsequent biopsy. Lesions with Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) scores of 4 and 5 more commonly had MRI PSAD of 0.15 ng/mL2 or higher (51.93% vs 22.22%, p = 0.01) than lesions with PI-RADS scores of 1-3. Median MRI PSAD was significantly higher in the upgraded group compared with the group that was not upgraded (0.15 ng/mL2 vs 0.11 ng/mL2, p = 0.01). MRI PSAD was significantly associated with increased odds of upgrading on subsequent biopsy (log transformation; odds ratio, 1.9 [95% CI, 1.2-2.8]; p = 0.01) after adjusting for age and length of follow-up. CONCLUSION. MRI PSAD was significantly associated with Gleason score upgrading on subsequent biopsy for men initially diagnosed with Gleason 3+3 disease. Although this result is intuitive, to our knowledge it has not been previously shown. As MRI utilization increases, MRI PSAD can aid in risk stratification for men managed with AS.""","""['Samuel L Washington rd', 'Avi S Baskin', 'Niloufar Ameli', 'Hao G Nguyen', 'Antonio C Westphalen', 'Katsuto Shinohara', 'Peter R Carroll']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""AJR Am J Roentgenol""","""['Risk-stratification based on magnetic resonance imaging and prostate-specific antigen density may reduce unnecessary follow-up biopsy procedures in men on active surveillance for low-risk prostate cancer.', 'The ability of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) density to predict an upgrade in Gleason score between initial prostate biopsy and prostatectomy diminishes with increasing tumour grade due to reduced PSA secretion per unit tumour volume.', 'Unified model involving genomics, magnetic resonance imaging and prostate-specific antigen density outperforms individual co-variables at predicting biopsy upgrading in patients on active surveillance for low risk prostate cancer.', 'Reliability of Serial Prostate Magnetic Resonance Imaging to Detect Prostate Cancer Progression During Active Surveillance: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.', 'PI-RADS 3 lesions: a critical review and discussion of how to improve management.', 'Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging-based Prostate Specific Antigen Density and PI-RADSv2 score help identify Apical Prostate Cancer.', 'Single center analysis of an advisable control interval for follow-up of patients with PI-RADS category 3 in multiparametric MRI of the prostate.', 'Tissue- and Liquid-Based Biomarkers in Prostate Cancer Precision Medicine.', 'Changes in Magnetic Resonance Imaging Using the Prostate Cancer Radiologic Estimation of Change in Sequential Evaluation Criteria to Detect Prostate Cancer Progression for Men on Active Surveillance.']"""

Incidence data (through 2016) were collected by the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program; the National Program of Cancer Registries; and the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries. Mortality data (through 2017) were collected by the National Center for Health Statistics. In 2020, 1,806,590 new cancer cases and 606,520 cancer deaths are projected to occur in the United States. The cancer death rate rose until 1991, then fell continuously through 2017, resulting in an overall decline of 29% that translates into an estimated 2.9 million fewer cancer deaths than would have occurred if peak rates had persisted. This progress is driven by long-term declines in death rates for the 4 leading cancers (lung, colorectal, breast, prostate); however, over the past decade (2008-2017), reductions slowed for female breast and colorectal cancers, and halted for prostate cancer. In contrast, declines accelerated for lung cancer, from 3% annually during 2008 through 2013 to 5% during 2013 through 2017 in men and from 2% to almost 4% in women, spurring the largest ever single-year drop in overall cancer mortality of 2.2% from 2016 to 2017. Yet lung cancer still caused more deaths in 2017 than breast, prostate, colorectal, and brain cancers combined. Recent mortality declines were also dramatic for melanoma of the skin in the wake of US Food and Drug Administration approval of new therapies for metastatic disease, escalating to 7% annually during 2013 through 2017 from 1% during 2006 through 2010 in men and women aged 50 to 64 years and from 2% to 3% in those aged 20 to 49 years; annual declines of 5% to 6% in individuals aged 65 years and older are particularly striking because rates in this age group were increasing prior to 2013. It is also notable that long-term rapid increases in liver cancer mortality have attenuated in women and stabilized in men.

Accumulating evidence suggested that prostate cancer non-coding RNA 1 (PRNCR1) participated in the pathogenesis of NSCLC, whereas the elaborate mechanism remains unclear. Hence, the role of PRNCR1 in the progression of NSCLC was investigated.  Methods:   Levels of PRNCR1, microRNA-126-5p (miR-126-5p), and metadherin (MTDH) were examined by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Cell proliferation was measured using Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8). Flow cytometry was conducted to determine cell apoptosis. Besides, transwell assay was performed to detect cell migration and invasion in NSCLC cells. The expression levels of E-cadherin, N-cadherin, Vimentin, and MTDH were detected via Western blot. Dual-luciferase reporter, RNA immunoprecipitation, and RNA pull down assays were employed to verify the relationship between miR-126-5p and PRNCR1 or MTDH.  Results:   PRNCR1 and MTDH levels were highly expressed, while miR-126-5p expression was lowly expressed in NSCLC tissues and cell lines. Knockdown of PRNCR1 promoted cell apoptosis, impeded proliferation, migration, invasion, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in NSCLC cells, and these effects were abrogated by its target gene of miR-126-5p inhibitor. Moreover, MTDH as the target of PRNCR1, its overexpression reversed the impacts of miR-126-5p mimic on cell behaviors and EMT in vitro. Finally, PRNCR1 and miR-126-5p regulated MTDH expression.

The classical mechanism of regulation of HIF-1 activity involves destabilisation of HIF-1α via oxygen-dependent hydroxylation of proline residues and subsequent proteasomal degradation. Studies from our laboratory revealed that nitric oxide (NO)-mediated activation of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) signalling inhibits the acquisition of hypoxia-induced malignant phenotypes in tumour cells. The present study aimed to elucidate a mechanism of HIF-1 regulation involving NO/cGMP signalling. Using human DU145 prostate cancer cells, we assessed the effect of the NO mimetic glyceryl trinitrate (GTN) and the cGMP analogue 8-Bromo-cGMP on hypoxic accumulation of HIF-1α. Concentrations of GTN known to primarily activate the NO/cGMP pathway (100 nM-1 µM) inhibited hypoxia-induced HIF-1α protein accumulation in a time-dependent manner. Incubation with 8-Bromo-cGMP (1 nM-10 µM) also attenuated HIF-1α accumulation, while levels of HIF-1α mRNA remained unaltered by exposure to GTN or 8-Bromo-cGMP. Furthermore, treatment of cells with the calpain (Ca2+-activated proteinase) inhibitor calpastatin attenuated the effects of GTN and 8-Bromo-cGMP on HIF-1α accumulation. However, since calpain activity was not affected by incubation of DU145 cells with various concentrations of GTN or 8-Bromo-cGMP (10 nM or 1 µM) under hypoxic or well-oxygenated conditions, it is unlikely that NO/cGMP signalling inhibits HIF-1α accumulation via regulation of calpain activity. These findings provide evidence for a role of NO/cGMP signalling in the regulation of HIF-1α, and hence HIF-1-mediated hypoxic responses, via a mechanism dependent on calpain.""","""['Judy Kim', 'Ivraym B Barsoum', 'Harrison Loh', 'Jean-François Paré', 'D Robert Siemens', 'Charles H Graham']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Biosci Rep""","""['Chemosensitization of cancer in vitro and in vivo by nitric oxide signaling.', 'Inflammation-induced fetal growth restriction in rats is associated with increased placental HIF-1α accumulation.', 'Calpain mediates a von Hippel-Lindau protein-independent destruction of hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha.', 'The role of nitric oxide (NO) in stability regulation of hypoxia inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha).', 'Nitric oxide signalling and cellular adaptations to changes in oxygenation.', 'Nitroglycerin: a comprehensive review in cancer therapy.', 'The Etiology and Pathophysiology Genesis of Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia and Prostate Cancer: A New Perspective.']"""

Compared with usual care, CBT significantly reduced fatigue [difference -7.2, 97.5% confidence interval (CI) -12.7 to -1.7; P = 0.003, d = 0.7], whereas GET did not (-4.7, 97.5% CI -10.2 to 0.9; P = 0.057, d = 0.4). CBT significantly reduced EORTC-QLQ-C30 fatigue (-13.1, 95% CI -22.1 to -4.0; P = 0.005) and improved quality of life (10.2, 95% CI 2.4 to 17.9; P = 0.011) and physical functioning (7.1, 95% CI 0.5 to 13.7; P = 0.036) compared with usual care. Improvement in emotional functioning and decrease in functional impairments failed to reach significance. GET did not improve secondary outcomes compared with usual care.  Conclusions:   Among advanced cancer patients with severe fatigue during treatment, a CBT intervention was more effective than usual care for reducing fatigue. Following GET, patients reported lower fatigue, but results were not significant, probably due to a smaller sample size and lower adherence than anticipated.

Few studies have examined associations of anthropometric factors (e.g. early adulthood obesity) with advanced prostate cancer risk.  Patients and methods:   We carried out pooled analyses to examine associations between body fatness, height, and prostate cancer risk. Among 830 772 men, 51 734 incident prostate cancer cases were identified, including 4762 advanced (T4/N1/M1 or prostate cancer deaths) cases, 2915 advanced restricted (same as advanced, but excluding localized cancers that resulted in death) cases, 9489 high-grade cases, and 3027 prostate cancer deaths. Cox proportional hazards models were used to calculate study-specific hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI); results were pooled using random effects models.  Results:   No statistically significant associations were observed for body mass index (BMI) in early adulthood for advanced, advanced restricted, and high-grade prostate cancer, and prostate cancer mortality. Positive associations were shown for BMI at baseline with advanced prostate cancer (HR = 1.30, 95% CI = 0.95-1.78) and prostate cancer mortality (HR = 1.52, 95% CI = 1.12-2.07) comparing BMI ≥35.0 kg/m2 with 21-22.9 kg/m2. When considering early adulthood and baseline BMI together, a 27% higher prostate cancer mortality risk (95% CI = 9% to 49%) was observed for men with BMI <25.0 kg/m2 in early adulthood and BMI ≥30.0 kg/m2 at baseline compared with BMI <25.0 kg/m2 in early adulthood and BMI <30.0 kg/m2 at baseline. Baseline waist circumference, comparing ≥110 cm with <90 cm, and waist-to-hip ratio, comparing ≥1.00 with <0.90, were associated with significant 14%-16% increases in high-grade prostate cancer risk and suggestive or significant 20%-39% increases in prostate cancer mortality risk. Height was associated with suggestive or significant 33%-56% risks of advanced or advanced restricted prostate cancer and prostate cancer mortality, comparing ≥1.90 m with <1.65 m.  Conclusion:   Our findings suggest that height and total and central adiposity in mid-to-later adulthood, but not early adulthood adiposity, are associated with risk of advanced forms of prostate cancer.

Methods:   In this cohort study, we enrolled eligible patients with prostate cancer who underwent radical prostatectomy at our center between 2001 and 2018. The primary endpoint was the incidence of postoperative biochemical failure, defined as two consecutive PSA levels >= 0.2 ng/dl. Patients with TNM stage >= III, Gleason score >=8, or baseline PSA above our calculated cut-off level were considered as high risk.

Method:   Among 272 patients treated between July 2015 and January 2019, 189 patients were enrolled in this prospective, cohort study and the patients were divided into three groups: group I, bilateral total orchiectomy (n 66); group II, bilateral subcapsular orchiectomy (n 63); and group III, LHRH analogue treatment (n 60). The adequacy of ADT was routinely monitored every 3 months and clinical parameters were evaluated. After 6 to 36 months following ADT, questionnaires were used to evaluate PTS, PTSD, and HRQoL during outpatient visits. The patient satisfaction was questioned as yes/no.  Results:   Adequate castration was provided with all three treatments, while the presence and frequency of PTS and severity of PTSD were lower, and patient satisfaction related to ADT and all components of HRQoL were better in patients undergoing subcapsular orchiectomy than those undergoing total orchiectomy. All findings except for PTS were similar in patients undergoing subcapsular orchiectomy and LHRH analogue treatment. In analysis of all patients, total incidence of PTS was 43.4% and PTSD was reported to be 48.7%. A strong relationship was found between PTSD and phantom testis pain (r 0.621, p < 0.001).

Methods:   Retrospective analysis of patients undergoing mpMRI, prostate biopsy and 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT over a 3-year period. Diagnostic performance of 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT and mpMRI were assessed using biopsy histopathology for the entire cohort and radical prostatectomy specimen in a subset of patients. Lesion concordance and additional detection of each modality were determined, including in a dedicated cohort of patients with mpMRI PIRADS 2 scans.  Results:   A total of 144 patients were included in the study. Index lesion/foci detection was similar between 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT and mpMRI (sensitivity 83.1% vs 90.1%; p = 0.267), however lesions missed by mpMRI were larger (1.66 cm3 vs 0.72 cm3; p = 0.034). Lesion detection rates were similar across the biopsy histopathology and radical prostatectomy specimen subset, with a high concordance for index (80.1%) and a moderate concordance for total (67%) lesions between the 2 imaging modalities. The additional detection yield favoured 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT over mpMRI for index (13.5% vs 4.3%) and total (18.2% vs 5.4%) lesions; both modalities missed 2.1% and 12.3% of index and total lesions, respectively. 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT identified 9 of 11 patients with PIRADS 2 mpMRI but subsequently diagnosed with Gleason ≥ 3 + 4 disease.

Methods:   TFP-MNPs were synthesized by copolymerizing poly(N-isopropylacrylamide), allylamine and a biodegradable photoluminescent polymer, and conjugating it on MNPs via a free radical polymerization reaction. Physicochemical properties of the nanoparticles were characterized using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, dynamic light scattering, and vibrational sample magnetometry.

However, the role and mechanism of SGO1 in tumors and even prostate cancer is not completely clear. In this study, expression of SGO1 in human prostate tumors were higher than that of adjacent normal tissues and were positively correlated with the poor prognosis of prostate cancer patients. SGO1 expression levels are also higher in several prostate cancer cell lines. In cell experiments, knockdown of SGO1 reduced cell proliferation, migration, and invasion in vitro and in vivo, and also inhibited cell cycle progression of prostate cancer cells. In contrast, ectopic expression of SGO1 has the opposite effects. In addition, knockdown of SGO1 induces apoptosis in prostate cancer cells by promoting cleaved caspase-3, caspase-9, and PARP. Importantly SGO1 function is dependent on AKT. Inhibition of AKT activity by AKT inhibitor abolished the role of SGO1 overexpression in promoting cell proliferation and metastasis. Therefore, SGO1 promotes the proliferation and metastasis of prostate cancer through the AKT pathway, and can be considered as an effective candidate for developing an effective prostate cancer treatment strategy.""","""['Qi Chen', 'Xiang Wan', 'Yanbo Chen', 'Chong Liu', 'Meng Gu', 'Zhong Wang']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Am J Cancer Res""","""['Sustained Shugoshin 1 downregulation reduces tumor growth and metastasis in a mouse xenograft tumor model of triple-negative breast cancer.', 'Overexpression of shugoshin1 predicts a poor prognosis for prostate cancer and promotes metastasis by affecting epithelial-mesenchymal transition.', 'S100A16 promotes cell proliferation and metastasis via AKT and ERK cell signaling pathways in human prostate cancer.', 'Eya2 Is Overexpressed in Human Prostate Cancer and Regulates Docetaxel Sensitivity and Mitochondrial Membrane Potential through AKT/Bcl-2 Signaling.', 'Down-regulation of LHPP in cervical cancer influences cell proliferation, metastasis and apoptosis by modulating AKT.', 'Sustained Shugoshin 1 downregulation reduces tumor growth and metastasis in a mouse xenograft tumor model of triple-negative breast cancer.', 'The TT Genotype of the KIAA1524 rs2278911 Polymorphism Is Associated with Poor Prognosis in Multiple Myeloma.', 'A Review of the Regulatory Mechanisms of N-Myc on Cell Cycle.', 'Establishment of Bactrian Camel Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells and Prediction of Their Unique Pluripotency Genes.', 'Identification and validation of a potential key gene SGOL1 for poor prognosis in hepatocellular carcinoma based on a bioinformatics approach.']"""

Enhanced flux is driven by spermidine/spermine N1-acetyltransferase (SSAT) activity, which acetylates polyamines leading to their secretion and drives biosynthetic demand. The methionine salvage pathway recycles one-carbon units lost to polyamine biosynthesis to the methionine cycle to overcome stress. Prostate cancer (CaP) relies on methylthioadenosine phosphorylase (MTAP), the rate-limiting enzyme, to relieve strain. Here, we show that inhibition of MTAP alongside SSAT upregulation is synergistic in androgen sensitive and castration recurrent CaP models in vitro and in vivo. The combination treatment increases apoptosis in radical prostatectomy ex vivo explant samples.

The existence of tolerated mutations in select ribosomal proteins (RPs), such as in Diamond-Blackfan anemia, is evidence that not all ribosome components are essential. Heterogeneity in the protein composition of eukaryotic ribosomes is an emerging concept with evidence that different pools of ribosomes exist with transcript-specificity. Here, we show that the polysome association of ribosomal proteins is altered by low oxygen (hypoxia), a feature of the tumor microenvironment, in human cells. We quantified ribosomal protein abundance in actively translating polysomes of normoxic and hypoxic HEK293 cells by tandem mass tags mass spectrometry. Our data suggest that RPS12 (eS12) is enriched in hypoxic monosomes, which increases the heavy polysome association of structured transcripts APAF-1 and XIAP. Furthermore, hypoxia induced five alternative splicing events within a subset of RP mRNAs in cell lines.

The objective of our study was to identify prostate cancer prognostic markers in patients 'sera using a multi-omics discovery platform.  Methods:   Pre-surgical serum samples collected from a longitudinal, racially diverse, prostate cancer patient cohort (N = 382) were examined. Linear Regression and Bayesian computational approaches integrated with multi-omics, were used to select markers to predict biochemical recurrence (BCR). BCR-free survival was modeled using unadjusted Kaplan-Meier estimation curves and multivariable Cox proportional hazards analysis, adjusted for key pathologic variables. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve statistics were used to examine the predictive value of markers in discriminating BCR events from non-events. The findings were further validated by creating a training set (N = 267) and testing set (N = 115) from the cohort.  Results:   Among 382 patients, 72 (19%) experienced a BCR event in a median follow-up time of 6.9 years. Two proteins-Tenascin C (TNC) and Apolipoprotein A1V (Apo-AIV), one metabolite-1-Methyladenosine (1-MA) and one phospholipid molecular species phosphatidic acid (PA) 18:0-22:0 showed a cumulative predictive performance of AUC = 0.78 [OR (95% CI) = 6.56 (2.98-14.40), P < 0.05], in differentiating patients with and without BCR event. In the validation set all four metabolites consistently reproduced an equivalent performance with high negative predictive value (NPV; > 80%) for BCR. The combination of pTstage and Gleason score with the analytes, further increased the sensitivity [AUC = 0.89, 95% (CI) = 4.45-32.05, P < 0.05], with an increased NPV (0.96) and OR (12.4) for BCR. The panel of markers combined with the pathological parameters demonstrated a more accurate prediction of BCR than the pathological parameters alone in prostate cancer.  Conclusions:   In this study, a panel of serum analytes were identified that complemented pathologic patient features in predicting prostate cancer progression.

An ultra-efficient photodynamic theranostics platform was developed here based on combining and potentiating a theranostic photosensitizer, TPCI, with other therapies for synergistic anticancer effect and synchronous self-reporting of therapeutic response. In this study, TPCI and a chemotherapy agent paclitaxel (PTX) were co-encapsulated in liposomes, which exhibited a superb synergistic anticancer effect against a series of tumor cell lines. The potency of both drugs had been boosted for up to 30-fold compared with sole PDT or chemotherapy. More strikingly, the released TPCI lighted up the nuclei of dead cells, triggered either by PDT or chemotherapy, through binding with the chromatin and activating its aggregation-induced emission, therefore self-reporting the anticancer effect of the combined therapy in real time. The in vivo study using a mouse model bearing PC3 prostate tumor cells demonstrated the effective ablation of tumors with initial sizes of 200 mm3 and the precise early tumor response monitoring by TPCI/PTX@Lipo.

However, little is known about HC patients with cancer or whether some of their care could potentially be prevented. This analysis sought to characterize HC patients with cancer and quantify the costs of preventable acute care (emergency department visits and inpatient hospitalizations).  Methods:   This analysis examined a population-based sample of all HC patients in Ontario in 2013. HC patients were defined as those above the 90th percentile of the cost distribution; all other patients were defined as non-high-cost (NHC). Patients with cancer were identified through the Ontario Cancer Registry. Sociodemographic and clinical characteristics were examined and the costs of preventable acute care for both groups by category of visit/condition were estimated using validated algorithms.  Results:   Compared with NHC patients with cancer (n=369,422), HC patients with cancer (n=187,770) were older (mean age 70 vs 65 years), more likely to live in low-income neighborhoods (19% vs 16%), sicker, and more likely to live in long-term care homes (8% vs 0%). Although most patients from both cohorts tended to be diagnosed with breast, prostate, or colorectal cancer, those with multiple myeloma or pancreatic or liver cancers were overrepresented among the HC group. Moreover, HC patients were more likely to have advanced cancer at diagnosis and be in the initial or terminal phase of treatment compared with NHC patients. Among HC patients with cancer, 9% of spending stemmed from potentially preventable/avoidable acute care, whereas for NHC patients, this spending was approximately 30%.  Conclusions:   HC patients with cancer are a unique subpopulation. Given the type of care they receive, there seems to be limited scope to prevent acute care spending among this patient group. To reduce costs, other strategies, such as making hospital care more efficient and generating less costly encounters involving chemotherapy, should be explored.""","""['Claire de Oliveira', 'Joyce Cheng', 'Kelvin Chan', 'Craig C Earle', 'Murray Krahn', 'Nicole Mittmann']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""J Natl Compr Canc Netw""","""['Clinical characteristics and preventable acute care spending among a high cost inpatient population.', 'Contribution of preventable acute care spending to total spending for high-cost Medicare patients.', 'Determining preventable acute care spending among high-cost patients in a single-payer public health care system.', 'Concentration of Potentially Preventable Spending Among High-Cost Medicare Subpopulations: An Observational Study.', 'Can high-cost spending in the community signal admission to hospital?

Methods:   Seven patients with PC and 20 patients with HNC who had received VMAT participated in this study. After obtaining photon fluence at the position of the EPID for each treatment arc from on-treatment integrated EPID images, we calculated the differences between the fluence for the first fraction and each subsequent fraction for each arc.

Biopsy was performed every 2 to 3 years, or upon changes in magnetic resonance imaging, prostate specific antigen level or digital rectal examination. The primary outcome was development of distant metastasis. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate treatment-free survival.  Results:   Median age at diagnosis was 67 years (IQR 61-72), median prostate specific antigen was 5 ng/ml (IQR 4-7) and most patients (69%) had nonpalpable disease.

We have also determined that the compounds are effective and selective for a broader cancer panel, including breast and lung cancer.

Fexapotide triflutate (FT) has been shown in human clinical trials to be a well-tolerated pharmaco-ablative agent with therapeutic benefit in patients with prostate enlargement and low-grade prostate cancer.  Methods:   Studies were undertaken in vitro and in the normal male rat to characterize and quantify selective ablation of prostate glandular cells exposed to fexapotide triflutate (FT) injections. N=371 2-month-old Sprague Dawley rats received direct intraprostatic injections under ether anesthesia with laparotomy (n=268 given 0.3 mL FT 0.1-2.0 mg/mL at varied schedules, and n=103 controls), and were sacrificed at intervals of 24 hr-12 months, with measurements of prostate volume, assessments of apoptosis, prostatic nerve structures, connective tissue stroma, and vasculature. In vitro prostate cell lines treated with FT were studied by electron microscopy and RNA quantification.  Results:   Evidence shows that FT leads to prostate glandular cell loss not found in controls, by apoptosis within 24-72 hrs that is highly selective for achieving near-total loss of glandular epithelium at 6 to 12 months, without any adverse microscopic effects to adjacent periprostatic nerves, vascular elements, and stroma.  Conclusion:   Histological studies in the rat demonstrate that FT ablative effect is selective for prostate glandular epithelium, sparing adjacent tissues and structures in the prostate including nerves, vasculature, and stroma.""","""['Paul Averback', 'Rajna Gohal', 'Marta Fuska', 'Kathleen Prins', 'Ping Wang']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Res Rep Urol""","""['A state-of-art review on the preservation of sexual function among various minimally invasive surgical treatments for benign prostatic hyperplasia: Impact on erectile and ejaculatory domains.', 'Fexapotide triflutate: results of long-term safety and efficacy trials of a novel injectable therapy for symptomatic prostate enlargement.', 'Prospective evaluation of fexapotide triflutate injection treatment of Grade Group 1 prostate cancer: 4-year results.', 'Efficacy and safety of fexapotide triflutate in outpatient medical treatment of male lower urinary tract symptoms associated with benign prostatic hyperplasia.', 'Possible mechanisms of action of transurethral needle ablation of the prostate on benign prostatic hyperplasia symptoms: a neurohistochemical study.', 'A state-of-art review on the preservation of sexual function among various minimally invasive surgical treatments for benign prostatic hyperplasia: Impact on erectile and ejaculatory domains.']"""

However, observational studies are susceptible to unmeasured confounding while studies of metformin use are also vulnerable to immortal time bias. The use of Mendelian randomization may reduce confounding due to random allocation of relevant genetic markers at birth, and may reduce immortal time bias (for metformin-related variants analysis) since the start of exposure is at birth.  Research design and methods:   We identified strong genetic predictors of fasting glucose, glycated hemoglobin, and type 2 diabetes from the Meta-Analyses of Glucose and Insulin-related traits Consortium and Diabetes Genetics Replication And Meta-analysis Consortium (n=140 595 for glucose; n=123 665 for HbA1c; n=898 130 for type 2 diabetes) and of AMPK-instrumented HbA1c reduction as a proxy of metformin and applied them to large genome-wide association studies of breast cancer (Breast Cancer Association Consortium; BCAC) and prostate cancer (Prostate Cancer Association Group to Investigate Cancer-Associated Alterations in the Genome; PRACTICAL). We used inverse variance weighting to obtain estimates. Sensitivity analyses included use of MR-Egger, weighted median, exclusion of pleiotropic instruments, and validation using UK Biobank (breast cancer only).  Results:   There was no association of fasting glucose (OR 1.03 per mmol/L, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.25), HbA1c (OR 1.02 per %, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.45), or type 2 diabetes (OR 0.98 per log odds, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.01) with breast cancer in BCAC, with similar findings from UK Biobank.

The binding of α5β1 integrin with the tripeptide Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) motif within the extracellular matrix protein fibronectin may be influenced by the α-1,6-fucose core or α-1,2-fucose and α-1,3/4-fucose peripheral N-glycan profiles. Here, we investigated whether fucosylation impacts the formation of matrix-free 3D multicellular tumor spheroids (MCTS) from human triple negative breast MDA-MB231 cell line, prostate PC3 and DU145 cell lines and DU145 gemcitabine resistant (GemR) variant by using the cyclic Arg-Gly-Asp-D-Phe-Lys peptide modified with 4-carboxybutyl-triphenylphosphonium bromide (cyclo-RGDfK(TPP)) peptide method.  Methods:   Microscopic imaging, lectin histochemistry, flow cytometry, WST-1 cell viability assay and You Only Look Once version 2 (YOLOv2) training object detection using cyclic learning rates were used to evaluate the formation of MCTS, morphologic changes, and the expression levels of α-1,6-fucose and α-1,2-fucose linkages on the cell surface.  Results:   DU145 prostate cancer cells expressed higher α-1,6-fucose than α-1,2-fucose linkages on their cell surface, as determined by lectin cytochemistry and flow cytometry. Blockage of the α-1,6- and α-1,2-fucose linkages with Aspergillus oryzae lectin (AOL) and Ulex Europaeus agglutinin I (UEA I) one hour before the addition of cyclic-RGDfK(TPP) peptide to the monolayer of the cancer cells resulted in a statistically significant dose-dependent reduction in spheroid volumes using threshold diameters of 40 and 60 µm. Application of a 40 µm threshold diameter measurements of spheroids resulted in fewer false-positive ones compared to the 60 µm diameter threshold previously used in our studies. A state-of-the-art, image object detection system YOLOv2 was used to automate the analysis of spheroid measurements and volumes. The results showed that YOLOv2 corroborated manual spheroid detection and volume measurements with high precision and accuracy.  Conclusion:   For the first time, the findings demonstrate that α-1,6- and α-1,2-fucose linkages of N-glycans on the cell surface receptors facilitate cyclo-RGDfK(TPP)-mediated self-assembly of cancer cells to form 3D multicellular tumor spheroids.""","""['Regina-Veronicka Kalaydina', 'Hedi Zhou', 'Elena Markvicheva', 'Sergey V Burov', 'Farhana Zulkernine', 'Myron R Szewczuk']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Onco Targets Ther""","""['Sialylation facilitates self-assembly of 3D multicellular prostaspheres by using cyclo-RGDfK(TPP) peptide.', 'Sialylation transmogrifies human breast and pancreatic cancer cells into 3D multicellular tumor spheroids using cyclic RGD-peptide induced self-assembly.', 'A Triple Combination of Metformin, Acetylsalicylic Acid, and Oseltamivir Phosphate Impacts Tumour Spheroid Viability and Upends Chemoresistance in Triple-Negative Breast Cancer.', 'Formation of multicellular tumor spheroids induced by cyclic RGD-peptides and use for anticancer drug testing in vitro.', 'The Diverse Contributions of Fucose Linkages in Cancer.', 'Recent Trends and Perspectives in Cerebral Organoids Imaging and Analysis.', 'FUT8 and Protein Core Fucosylation in Tumours: From Diagnosis to Treatment.', 'Post-Translational Modifications That Drive Prostate Cancer Progression.']"""

Genetic and epigenetic alterations are the key elements of the prostate carcinogenesis. A group of compounds able to induce changes in this sense is inhibitors of histone deacetylase, to which it belongs valproic acid (VPA). In the present paper, we evaluated the role of this molecule on the neuroendocrine differentiation of LNCaP cells together with the effect on proliferation and survival signals.  Methods:   Cell growth was analyzed by MTT and flow cytometry, while expression of proteins through Western blot analysis.  Results:   Our results have documented that VPA in LNCaP cells reduces cell proliferation, decreases the S phase and Cyclin A, and up-regulates the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors p21waf and p27. The acquisition of androgen-independent condition is consistent with an induction of β-III Tubulin and gamma Enolase, both markers of neuroendocrine phenotype. However, all these features cease with the removal of valproate from the culture medium, demonstrating the transitory nature of the epigenetic event. The VPA treatment does not compromise the survival phosphorylated signals of Akt, ERK1/2 and mTOR/p70S6K that remain up-regulated. Consistently, there is an increase of phospho-FOXO3a, to which corresponds the decreased expression of the corresponding oncosuppressor protein.  Conclusion:   Overall, our findings indicate that VPA in LNCaP prostate tumor cells, although it reduces cell proliferation, is able to drive neuroendocrine phenotype and to maintain the survival of these cells. Keeping in mind that neuroendocrine differentiation of prostate cancer appears to be associated with a poor prognosis, it is necessary to develop new treatments that do not induce neurodifferentiation but able to counteract cell survival.""","""['Francesca Giordano', 'Giuseppina Daniela Naimo', 'Alessandra Nigro', 'Francesco Romeo', 'Alessandro Paolì', 'Francesca De Amicis', 'Adele Vivacqua', 'Catia Morelli', 'Loredana Mauro', 'Maria Luisa Panno']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Drug Des Devel Ther""","""['Valproic acid induces neuroendocrine differentiation and UGT2B7 up-regulation in human prostate carcinoma cell line.', 'Does valproic acid induce neuroendocrine differentiation in prostate cancer?', 'Low dosed interferon alpha augments the anti-tumor potential of histone deacetylase inhibition on prostate cancer cell growth and invasion.', 'Valproic acid activates notch-1 signaling and regulates the neuroendocrine phenotype in carcinoid cancer cells.', 'Cytotoxic Effects of Valproic Acid on Neuroendocrine Tumour Cells.', 'Potent FOXO3a Activators from Biologically Active Compound Library for Cancer Therapeutics: An\xa0in\xa0silico Approach.', 'Valproic acid inhibits cell growth in both MCF-7 and MDA-MB231 cells by triggering different responses in a cell type-specific manner.', 'Phytochemical Profile and In Vitro Antioxidant and Photobiological Properties of Different Extracts from Prangos ferulacea Lindl.', ""From HDAC to Voltage-Gated Ion Channels: What's Next?

Demographic, clinical and histological data were collected and analysed. Discrimination and calibration of Cormio nomogram were assessed with the receiver operator characteristics (ROC) curve and calibration plots. The clinical net benefit of the nomogram was assessed with decision curve analysis. Clinically significant PCa was defined as ISUP grade group > 1.  Results:   After accounting for inclusion criteria, 1377 patients were analysed. 816/1377 (59%) had cancer at final pathology (574/816, 70%, clinically significant PCa). Multivariable analysis showed age, prostate volume, DRE and post-voided residual volume as independent predictors of any PCa. Discrimination of the nomogram for cancer was 0.70 on ROC analysis. Calibration of the nomogram was excellent (p = 0.94) and the nomogram presented a net benefit in the 40-80% range of probabilities. Multivariable analysis for predictors of clinically significant PCa found age, PSA, prostate volume and DRE as independent variables. Discrimination of the nomogram was 0.73. Calibration was poor (p = 0.001) and the nomogram presented a net benefit in the 25-75% range of probabilities.

Methods:   In this prospective study, hrPC patients scheduled to radical prostatectomy (RPx) with extended lymphadenectomy (eLND) were staged with wbPET/MRI and either 68Ga-PSMA-11 or 11C-choline including simultaneous multiparametric MRI (mpMRI). Images were assessed in two sessions, first as PBR (mpMRI and wbMRI) and second as wbPET/MRI. Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System criteria (PIRADS v2) were used for T-staging. Results were correlated with the exact anatomical localization and extension as defined by histopathology. Diagnostic accuracy of cTNM stage according to PBR was compared to pathological pTNM stage as reference standard.  Results:   Thirty-four patients underwent wbPET/MRI of 68Ga-PSMA-11 (n = 17) or 11C-choline (n = 17). Twenty-four patients meeting the inclusion criteria of localized disease ± nodal disease based on imaging results underwent RPx and eLND, whereas ten patients were excluded from analysis due to metastatic disease. T-stage was best defined by mpMRI with underestimation of tumor lesion size by PET for both tracers. N-stage yielded a per patient sensitivity/specificity comparable to PBR.

Despite good treatment methods, the number of cases has increased significantly in recent years. Here, we studied the expression of NEK1, NEK2, NEK3, and NEK5 in different types of normal and malignant tissues, using tissue microarray analysis, and identified NEKs as potential markers in thyroid malignancy.  Methods:   The studied cases comprised multiple cancer tissue microarrays, including breast, colon, esophagus, kidney, lung, pancreas, prostate, stomach, thyroid and uterine cervix, as well as 281 patients who underwent thyroid resection for thyroid cancer or thyroid nodules. The expression of NEK1, NEK2, NEK3, and NEK5 was analyzed by immunohistochemistry. The expression pattern was evaluated in terms of intensity by two methods, semiquantitative and quantitative, and was compared between normal and cancer tissue.  Results:   We analysed the expression of each member of the NEK family in a tissue-dependent manner. Compared to normal tissue, most of the evaluated proteins showed lower expression in lung tumour. However, in the thyroid, the expression was higher in malignant tissue, especially for NEK 1, NEK3 and NEK5. Concerning characteristics of the thyroid tumour, such as aggressiveness, NEK1 expression was higher in tumours with multifocality and in patients with lymph node metastasis. NEK3 expression was stronger in patients with stage II, that involved metastasis. NEK5, on the other hand, showed high expression in patients with invasion and metastasis and in patients with tumour size > 4 cm. Furthermore, this work, demonstrated for the first time a high specificity and sensitivity of over-expression of NEK1 in classical and follicular variants of papillary thyroid cancer and NEK3 in tall-cell papillary thyroid cancer.  Conclusion:   Taken together, the NEK protein kinases emerge as important proteins in thyroid cancer development and may help to identify malignancy and aggressiveness features during diagnosis.

Methods:   The planning computed tomography scans of 39 patients who received stereotactic body radiotherapy for prostate cancer were used. All patients inserted a hydrogel spacer and underwent computed tomography scans before and after spacer insertion. The three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy plans according to NCCN classification, low-, intermediate- and high-risk, were made for each patient. Clinical target volume included prostate and seminal vesicle 2 cm for high risk, prostate and seminal vesicle 1 cm for intermediate risk and prostate only for low risk. Three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy including a seven-field conformal technique with 76 Gy in 38 fractions. Dose constraints for rectum and bladder were V70 Gy ≤ 15%, V65 Gy ≤ 30% and V40 Gy ≤ 60%.  Results:   Among 39 patients, 35 (90%), 19 (49%) and 13 (33%) and 38 (97%), 38 (97%) and 34 (87%) patients before and after the spacer insertion fulfilled rectum dose constraints for low-, intermediate- and high-risk plans, respectively. A hydrogel spacer significantly reduced rectum dose and improved the rectum dose constraints fulfillment rate in intermediate (P < 0.01) and high (P < 0.01), but no difference was found in low-risk plan (P = 0.25). On multivariate analysis, spacer use was associated with the higher rectum dose constraints fulfillment rate.

Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) play critical roles in tumor progression of PCa. Nevertheless, the biological function of lncRNAs in PCa bone metastasis remains unclear. PCAT7 was identified as a bone metastasis-related lncRNA via analyzing TCGA dataset. Meanwhile, PCAT7 was found to be elevated in primary PCa tissues with bone metastasis and associated with bone metastasis status and poor prognosis of patients with PCa. Functionally, our results reveal that PCAT7 overexpression promotes PCa bone metastasis in vivo, as well as migration, invasion, and EMT of PCa cells in vitro; on the contrary, PCAT7 knockdown has an inverse effect. Mechanistically, PCAT7 activates TGF-β/SMAD signaling by upregulating TGFBR1 expression via sponging miR-324-5p. In turn, TGF-β signaling forms a positive feedback loop with PCAT7 via SMAD3/SP1 complex-induced PCAT7 upregulation. Finally, the clinical positive correlation between PCAT7 and TGFBR1 and TGF-β signaling activity, and the negative association with miR-324-5p are further demonstrated in PCa tissues and clinical primary PCa cells. This study reveals a novel mechanism that is responsible for the constitutive activation of TGF-β signaling in PCa bone metastasis, implying that PCAT7 can act as a potential therapeutic target against bone metastasis of PCa via disrupting the constitutive active loop between PCAT7 and TGF-β signaling.""","""['Chuandong Lang', 'Yuhu Dai', 'Zhengquan Wu', 'Qing Yang', 'Shaofu He', 'Xin Zhang', 'Wei Guo', 'Yingrong Lai', 'Hong Du', 'Hehe Wang', 'Dong Ren', 'Xinsheng Peng']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Mol Oncol""","""['Copy number gain of ZEB1 mediates a double-negative feedback loop with miR-33a-5p that regulates EMT and bone metastasis of prostate cancer dependent on TGF-β signaling.', 'The TGF-β signalling negative regulator PICK1 represses prostate cancer metastasis to bone.', 'Oncogenic miR-210-3p promotes prostate cancer cell EMT and bone metastasis via NF-κB signaling pathway.', 'MiRNAs and LncRNAs: Dual Roles in TGF-β Signaling-Regulated Metastasis in Lung Cancer.', 'Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) in prostate cancer: A dual function mediator?', 'FOXA1-induced LINC00621 promotes lung adenocarcinoma progression via activating the TGF-β signaling pathway.', 'Long non-coding RNAs in bone metastasis: progresses and perspectives as potential diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers.', 'Animal models of cancer metastasis to the bone.', 'An m7G-related lncRNA signature predicts prognosis and reveals the immune microenvironment in bladder cancer.', 'Prognostic values of long noncoding RNA in bone metastasis of prostate cancer: A systematic review and meta-analysis.']"""

Patients with newly diagnosed prostate cancer (PCa) face the challenge of deciding among multiple initial treatment modalities. The purpose of this study is to utilize artificial neural network (ANN) modeling to predict survival outcomes according to initial treatment modality and to develop an online decision-making support system.  Methods:   Data were collected retrospectively from 7267 patients diagnosed with PCa between January 1988 and December 2017. The analyses included 19 pretreatment clinicopathological covariates. Multilayer perceptron (MLP), MLP for N-year survival prediction (MLP-N), and long short-term memory (LSTM) ANN models were used to analyze progression to castration-resistant PCa (CRPC)-free survival, cancer-specific survival (CSS), and overall survival (OS), according to initial treatment modality. The performances of the ANN and the Cox-proportional hazards regression models were compared using Harrell's C-index.  Results:   The ANN models provided higher predictive power for 5- and 10-year progression to CRPC-free survival, CSS, and OS compared to the Cox-proportional hazards regression model. The LSTM model achieved the highest predictive power, followed by the MLP-N, and MLP models. We developed an online decision-making support system based on the LSTM model to provide individualized survival outcomes at 5 and 10 years, according to the initial treatment strategy.

BCOR is often mutated in cancers and hematological diseases and as a component of a non-canonical polycomb repressive complex 1 (ncPRC1.1) required for arranging many facets of cellular differentiation. However, its role in androgen signaling or prostate cancer cells remains unknown. Here, our genome-wide analyses reveal that BCOR is recruited in an androgen-dependent fashion to majority of AR-binding chromatin sites in castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) cells. Interestingly, depletion of BCOR has a significant effect on the expression of androgen-repressed genes linked to regulation of cell proliferation, differentiation and development. At many of these genes, such as HOX genes, the depletion leads to a decrease in H2A K119 monoubiquitination and an increase in mRNA expression. Consistently, BCOR depletion impairs the proliferation and viability of CRPC cells, inducing their apoptosis.

The problem is exacerbated in organ sites such as the prostate, where unnecessarily wide local excisions can result in significant deterioration of post-operative quality of life due to collateral damage to neighboring structures. Yet, at the same time, incomplete tumor removal results in worsened prognosis and need for additional interventions. Here, we report the design and development of a rapid and completely automated system for intraoperative gigapixel ex vivo microscopy of the circumferential surgical prostate margin within intra-operative timeframes, called the Automated Prostate Positioning System (APPS). The APPS leverages the rotational geometry of the prostate and high speed structured illumination microscopy (SIM) to generate continuous gigapixel panoramas of the fresh intact prostate circumference, including areas of the prostate adjacent to the neurovascular bundles, the rectum, and the bladder wall. Our previous work using SIM and a manual prostate handling method demonstrated the promise of the imaging technique for accurate detection of positive surgical margins. Our work here advances the technology toward clinical adoption, by demonstrating 10% greater tissue surface coverage fraction, 1.6× faster imaging throughput, and reduced number of required operator steps, compared to our prior approach.

After semiautomatic (isocontour-based) tumor delineation, the following lesion-based metrics were derived: mean, peak, and maximum tumor-to-blood ratio; SUVmean, SUVpeak, and SUVmax normalized to body weight; tumor volume; and total lesion uptake (TLU). Additionally, patient-based total tumor volume (TTV) (sum of PSMA-positive tumor volumes) and total tumor burden (TTB) (sum of all lesion TLUs) were derived. Repeatability was analyzed using repeatability coefficients (RC) and intraclass correlation coefficients. Additionally, the effect of point-spread function (PSF) image reconstruction on the repeatability of uptake metrics was evaluated. Results: In total, 36 18F-DCFPyL PET-positive lesions were analyzed (≤5 lesions per patient). The RCs for mean, peak, and maximum tumor-to-blood ratio were 31.8%, 31.7%, and 37.3%, respectively. For SUVmean, SUVpeak, and SUVmax, the RCs were 24.4%, 25.3%, and 31.0%, respectively. All intraclass correlation coefficients were at least 0.97. Tumor volume delineations were quite repeatable, with an RC of 28.1% for individual lesion volumes and 17.0% for TTV. TTB had an RC of 23.2% and 33.4% when based on SUVmean and mean tumor-to-blood ratio, respectively. Small lesions (<4.2 cm3) had worse repeatability for volume measurements. The repeatability of SUVpeak, TLU, and all patient-level metrics was not affected by PSF reconstruction. Conclusion:18F-DCFPyL uptake measurements are quite repeatable and can be used for clinical validation in future treatment response assessment studies. Patient-based TTV may be preferred for multicenter studies because its repeatability was both high and robust to different image reconstructions.""","""['Bernard H E Jansen', 'Matthijs C F Cysouw', 'André N Vis', 'Reindert J A van Moorselaar', 'Jens Voortman', 'Yves J L Bodar', 'Patrick R Schober', 'N Harry Hendrikse', 'Otto S Hoekstra', 'Ronald Boellaard', 'D E Oprea-Lager']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""J Nucl Med""","""['Intraindividual Comparison of 18F-PSMA-1007 and 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT in the Prospective Evaluation of Patients with Newly Diagnosed Prostate Carcinoma: A Pilot Study.', 'Simplified Methods for Quantification of 18F-DCFPyL Uptake in Patients with Prostate Cancer.', 'Prospective Comparison of PET Imaging with PSMA-Targeted 18F-DCFPyL Versus Na18F for Bone Lesion Detection in Patients with Metastatic Prostate Cancer.', '2-(3-{1-Carboxy-5-(6-18Ffluoro-pyridine-3-carbonyl)-amino-pentyl}-ureido)-pentanedioic acid.', '18FDCFPyL PET/CT for Imaging of Prostate Cancer.', 'Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen Targeted Pet/CT Imaging in Patients with Colon, Gastric and Pancreatic Cancer.', 'Reliability of gradient-based segmentation for measuring metabolic parameters influenced by uptake time on 18F-PSMA-1007 PET/CT for prostate cancer.', 'High SUVs Have More Robust Repeatability in Patients with Metastatic Prostate Cancer: Results from a Prospective Test-Retest Cohort Imaged with 18F-DCFPyL.', 'Molecular Targeted Positron Emission Tomography Imaging and Radionuclide Therapy of Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma.', 'Bone Metastases Are Measurable: The Role of Whole-Body MRI and Positron Emission Tomography.']"""

Owing to a lack of long-term data, HIFU is recommended for use only in the context of research.  Objective:   To examine the trend for HIFU use nationally and rates of strictures and fistulae.  Design, setting, and participants:   Patients undergoing HIFU for prostate cancer between April 2007 and March 2018 were studied in an English national database (Hospital Episode Statistics). Data on complications were included for patients with a minimum of 1-yr follow-up. Analysis of complications was controlled for other interventions.  Outcome measures and statistical analysis:   Descriptive analyses of HIFU rates and the incidence of strictures and fistulae were carried out. Cox and logistic regression models were built for urethral stricture incidence.  Results and limitations:   A total of 2320 HIFU treatments among 1990 patients were identified. The median age was 67yr (interquartile range 61-72). Some 1742 patients met the criteria for follow-up analysis. The highest-volume centre performed 1513 HIFU procedures, followed by 194 at the second highest. The number of HIFU procedures increased annually, rising from 196 to 283 per year. There were 208 patients (11.9%) who went on to have radiotherapy and 102 (5.9%) radical prostatectomy after HIFU. Following HIFU, stricture developed in 133/1290 patients (10.3%) and urinary fistula in 16/1240 (1.3%) before any further intervention. More recent years for HIFU were associated with a lower likelihood of stricture formation (2016/2017 vs 2007/2008: hazard ratio 0.30, 95% confidence interval 0.11-0.79; p=0.015). Limitations include the lack of staging information and unknown rates of HIFU outside of publicly funded health care.  Conclusions:   HIFU is performed at a large number of low-volume centres and complication rates do not differ from those for established therapies.  Patient summary:   This report highlights the trend for provision of high-intensity focused ultrasound treatment for prostate cancer in England. The results suggest that the rate of urethral structural complications may not be lower than that for established prostate cancer treatments.""","""['Amandeep Dosanjh', 'Philip Harvey', 'Simon Baldwin', 'Harriet Mintz', 'Felicity Evison', 'Suzy Gallier', 'Nigel Trudgill', 'Nicholas D James', 'Prasanna Sooriakumaran', 'Prashant Patel']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Eur Urol Focus""","""['Results of high intensity focused ultrasound treatment of prostate cancer: early Canadian experience at a single center.', 'High-intensity focused ultrasound for localized prostate cancer: initial experience with a 2-year follow-up.', 'Medium-term Outcomes after Whole-gland High-intensity Focused Ultrasound for the Treatment of Nonmetastatic Prostate Cancer from a Multicentre Registry Cohort.', 'High-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) for definitive treatment of prostate cancer.', 'Transrectal high-intensity focused ultrasound in the treatment of localized prostate cancer.', 'Whole-gland high-intensity focused ultrasound ablation and transurethral resection of the prostate in the patients with prostate cancer: A systematic review and meta-analysis.']"""

Objective:   To test whether addition of chemotherapy to surgery for high-risk prostate cancer improves progression-free survival (PFS).  Design, setting, and participants:   Eligible patients after prostatectomy were randomized to the SOC group with observation or to the chemotherapy group with docetaxel and prednisone administered every 3 wk for six cycles. Randomization was stratified for prostate-specific antigen, Gleason, tumor stage, and surgical margin status.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   The primary endpoint was PFS. Secondary endpoints included overall, prostate cancer-specific, and metastasis-free survival, and time to androgen deprivation therapy.  Results and limitations:   A total of 298 of the planned 636 patients were randomized. The median follow-up was 59.1 mo (0.2-103.7 mo). For the primary endpoint, the two groups did not statistically differ in PFS (median 55.5 mo in the chemotherapy group and 42.2 mo in the SOC group; test adjusted for site via gamma frailty p=0.21; adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 0.80; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.58-1.11; p=0.18). Prespecified subgroup analyses showed benefit in PFS for patients with tumor stage ≥T3b (HR 0.54, 95% CI 0.32-0.92; p=0.022) and patients with Gleason score ≤7 (HR 0.65, 95% CI 0.43-0.99; p=0.046). Secondary endpoint analyses are hampered by low event rates. The most common adverse events (≥grade 3 related or possibly related to chemotherapy) included neutropenia (43%), hyperglycemia (20%), and fatigue (5%), with febrile neutropenia in 2%.  Conclusions:   Adjuvant chemotherapy in high-risk prostate cancer using docetaxel and prednisone did not lead to statistically significant improvement in PFS for the intention-to-treat population as a whole. The analysis was challenged by lower power due to accrual limitation. Subgroup analyses suggest potential benefit for patients with Gleason grade ≤7 and stage≥pT3b (ClinicalTrials.gov number NCT00132301).

Materials/methods:   Patients with localised prostate adenocarcinoma and nodal involvement risk > 20%, were randomised to prostate only (PORT, 68 Gy/25# to prostate) and whole pelvis (WPRT, 68 Gy/25# to prostate and 50 Gy/25# to pelvis) arms with stratification for TURP, Gleason score, baseline PSA, and type of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). Image guided intensity modulated radiotherapy (IG-IMRT) and two years of ADT were mandatory. Acute and late genitourinary (GU) and gastrointestinal (GI) toxicities were graded using RTOG grading. QOL was assessed using EORTC QLQ-C30 and PR-25 questionnaire pre-treatment and every 3-6 months post RT.  Results:   Total 224 patients were randomised (PORT 114, WPRT 110) from November 2011 to August 2017. Median follow up was 44.5 months. No RTOG grade IV toxicity was observed. Acute GI and GU toxicities were similar between both the arms. Cumulative ≥ grade II late GI toxicity was similar for WPRT and PORT (6.5% vs. 3.8%, p = 0.39) but GU toxicity was higher (17.7% vs. 7.5%, p = 0.03). Dosimetric analysis showed higher bladder volume receiving 30-40 Gy in the WPRT arm (V30, 60% vs. 36%, p < 0.001; V40, 41% vs. 25%, p < 0.001). There was no difference in QOL scores of any domain between both arms.  Conclusion:   Pelvic irradiation using hypofractionated IG-IMRT resulted in increased grade II or higher late genitourinary toxicity as compared to prostate only RT, but the difference was not reflected in patient reported QOL.

Next-generation sequencing assays allow for the simultaneous interrogation of extended sets of somatic single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) in circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA), a mixture of DNA molecules originating both from normal and tumor tissue cells. However, low circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) fractions together with sequencing background noise and potential tumor heterogeneity challenge the ability to confidently call SNVs.  Results:   We present a computational methodology, called Adaptive Base Error Model in Ultra-deep Sequencing data (ABEMUS), which combines platform-specific genetic knowledge and empirical signal to readily detect and quantify somatic SNVs in cfDNA. We tested the capability of our method to analyze data generated using different platforms with distinct sequencing error properties and we compared ABEMUS performances with other popular SNV callers on both synthetic and real cancer patients sequencing data. Results show that ABEMUS performs better in most of the tested conditions proving its reliability in calling low variant allele frequencies somatic SNVs in low ctDNA levels plasma samples.

This mobilization is also a significant factor in human disease. The only autonomous human retroelement, L1, has propagated to make up 17% of the human genome, accumulating over 500,000 copies. The majority of these loci are truncated or defective with only a few reported to remain capable of retrotransposition. We have previously published a strand-specific RNA-Seq bioinformatics approach to stringently identify at the locus-specific level the few expressed full-length L1s using cytoplasmic RNA. With growing repositories of RNA-Seq data, there is potential to mine these datasets to identify and study expressed L1s at single-locus resolution, although many datasets are not strand-specific or not generated from cytoplasmic RNA.  Results:   We developed whole-cell, cytoplasmic and nuclear RNA-Seq datasets from 22Rv1 prostate cancer cells to test the influence of different preparations on the quality and effort needed to measure L1 expression. We found that there was minimal data loss in the identification of full-length expressed L1 s using whole cell, strand-specific RNA-Seq data compared to cytoplasmic, strand-specific RNA-Seq data. However, this was only possible with an increased amount of manual curation of the bioinformatics output to eliminate increased background. About half of the data was lost when the sequenced datasets were non-strand specific.

However, the pharmacokinetic distinction between the relevant drugs is an insurmountable barrier to the realization of their synergistic use against cancer. To overcome the disadvantages of combination chemotherapy in the treatment of PCA, targeted nanoparticles (NPs), which can codeliver docetaxel (DOC) and doxorubicin (DOX) at optimal synergistic proportions, have been designed. In this study, the DOC and DOX codelivery nanoparticles (DDC NPs) were constructed by hyaluronic acid (HA) and cationic amphipathic starch (CSaSt) through a self-assembly process. Human PCA cell lines (PC-3, DU-145, and LNCap) and mouse models were then used for evaluation in vitro and in vivo, respectively, of delivery and antitumor effects. The DDC NPs were spherical with rough surfaces, and the size and zeta potential were 68.4 ± 7.1 nm and -22.8 ± 2.2 mV, respectively. The encapsulation efficiencies of DOC and DOX in the NPs were 96.1 ± 2.3% and 91.4 ± 3.7%, respectively, while the total drug loading was 9.1 ± 1.7%. Moreover, the ratio of DOC to DOX in the DDC NPs was approximately 1:400, which aligned with the optimal synergistic proportions of the drugs. The DDC NPs exhibited excellent loading capacities, performed sustained and enzymatic release, and were stable in PBS, medium, and serum. After investigations in vitro, the DDC NPs were as effective as the dual drug combination in terms of cytotoxicity, antimigration, and apoptosis. Internalization results indicated that the DDC NPs could effectively deliver and fully release the payloads into PCA cells, and the process was mediated by the ligand-receptor interaction of HA with the CD44 protein. Low toxicity in vivo was confirmed by acute toxicity and hemolytic assays. The distribution in vivo showed that DDC NPs could enhance the accumulation of drugs in tumors and decrease nonspecific accumulation in normal organs. More importantly, DDC NPs significantly promoted the curative effect of the DOC and DOX combination in the PCA cell xenograft mouse model, indicating that the drugs with NPs did indeed act synergistically. This study suggests that the DDC NPs possess noteworthy potential as prospects for the development of PCA clinical chemotherapy.""","""['Ke Li', 'Wenhua Zhan', 'Yulong Chen', 'Rajiv Kumar Jha', 'Xueli Chen']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Front Pharmacol""","""['Dual Loading of Nanoparticles with Doxorubicin and Icotinib for the Synergistic Suppression of Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer.', 'Codelivery of doxorubicin and curcumin with lipid nanoparticles results in improved efficacy of chemotherapy in liver cancer.', 'Mulberry-like dual-drug complicated nanocarriers assembled with apogossypolone amphiphilic starch micelles and doxorubicin hyaluronic acid nanoparticles for tumor combination and targeted therapy.', 'Hyaluronic acid-capped compact silica-supported mesoporous titania nanoparticles for ligand-directed delivery of doxorubicin.', 'Rational design and latest advances of codelivery systems for cancer therapy.', 'Synthesis of Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen-Targeted Bimodal Conjugates of Cytotoxic Agents and Antiandrogens and Their Comparative Assessment with Monoconjugates.', 'PCL-based nanoparticles for doxorubicin-ezetimibe co-delivery: A combination therapy for prostate cancer using a drug repurposing strategy.', 'Dual-Drug Delivery by Anisotropic and Uniform Hybrid Nanostructures: A Comparative Study of the Function and Substrate-Drug Interaction Properties.', 'Plk1 Inhibitors and Abiraterone Synergistically Disrupt Mitosis and Kill Cancer Cells of Disparate Origin Independently of Androgen Receptor Signaling.', 'Prostate Cancer Review: Genetics, Diagnosis, Treatment Options, and Alternative Approaches.']"""

Prostate cancer associated transcript-1 (PCAT-1) is a lncRNA up-regulated in major types of cancers and is associated with the poor prognosis of cancer patients. This study aimed to understand the expression and role of PCAT-1 in the progression and metastasis of ESCC and to identify the potential lncRNA-miRNA interactions and signaling pathways underlying the mechanisms of action of PCAT-1 in ESCC.  Materials and methods:   Gene expression levels were determined by qRT-PCR; protein levels were determined by Western blot assay; cell proliferation, invasion and migration were determined by CCK-8, Transwell invasion and wound healing assays, respectively; in vivo tumor growth was evaluated by xenograft nude mice model.  Results:   Our data showed the up-regulation of PCAT-1 in different human ESCC cell lines and in clinical ESCC tissues. Knockdown of PCAT-1 in ESCC cells significantly inhibited the proliferation, invasion and migration of the cancer cells. Moreover, we showed the interactions between PCAT-1 and miR-508-3p and demonstrated that PCAT-1 was able to repress miR-508-3p expression in ESCC cells via acting as a competing endogenous RNA. Besides, Annexin A10 (ANXA10) was identified to be the downstream target of the PCAT-1 and miR-508-3p interactions.  Conclusion:   This study demonstrated the functional role of PCAT-1 in promoting the proliferation, invasion and migration of ESCC cells. We also identified a PCAT-1/miR-508-3p/ANXA10 axis in mediating the promoting role of PCAT-1 in the progression of ESCC.

A 5-year follow-up study was performed to analyze the prognostic value of DGCR5 for PC. The interaction between DGCR5 and TGF-β1 was analyzed by overexpression experiments. Cell stemness was analyzed by cell stemness assay.  Results:   In our study, we found that DGCR5 was down-regulated in tumor tissues than in adjacent healthy tissues of PC patients, but TGF-β1 was up-regulated in the tumor tissues. DGCR5 expression was not affected by clinical stages, but low DGCR5 level in the tumor was correlated with poor survival. DGCR5 and TGF-β1 were inversely correlated in tumor tissues but not in adjacent healthy tissues. DGCR5 over-expression resulted in down-regulation of TGF-β1, while TGF-β1 treatment did not significantly affect DGCR5 expression. DGCR5 over-expression led to decreased stemness of PC cells, but TGF-β1 treatment played a reverse role and attenuated the effects of DGCR5 over-expression.

Among these intrinsic fluorophores, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (phosphate) (NAD(P)H) and flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD)-essential coenzymes in cellular respiration-have been used as intrinsic fluorescent biomarkers for metabolic states in cancer and other pathologies. Traditional FLIM imaging for NAD(P)H, FAD, and in particular fluorescence lifetime redox ratio (FLIRR) requires a sequential multiwavelength excitation to avoid spectral bleed-through (SBT). This sequential imaging complicates image acquisition, may introduce motion artifacts, and reduce temporal resolution. Testing several two-photon excitation wavelengths in combination with optimized emission filters, we have proved a FLIM imaging protocol, allowing simultaneous image acquisition with a single 800-nm wavelength excitation for NADH and FAD with negligible SBT. As a first step, standard NADH and FAD single and mixed solutions were tested that mimic biological sample conditions. After these optimization steps, the assay was applied to two prostate cancer live cell lines: African-American (AA) and Caucasian-American (LNCaP), used in our previous publications. FLIRR result shows that, in cells, the 800-nm two-photon excitation wavelength is suitable for NADH and FAD FLIM imaging with negligible SBT. While NAD(P)H signals are decreased, sufficient photons are present for accurate lifetime fitting and FAD signals are measurably increased at lower laser power, compared with the common 890-nm excitation conditions. This single wavelength excitation allows a simplification of NADH and FAD FLIM imaging data analysis, decreasing the total imaging time. It also avoids motion artifacts and increases temporal resolution. This simplified assay will also make it more suitable to be applied in a clinical setting.""","""['Ruofan Cao', 'Horst Wallrabe', 'Ammasi Periasamy']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""J Biomed Opt""","""['Multicolor two-photon imaging of endogenous fluorophores in living tissues by wavelength mixing.', 'Bioenergetic Alterations of Metabolic Redox Coenzymes as NADH, FAD and FMN by Means of Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging Techniques.', 'Investigation of Mitochondrial Metabolic Response to Doxorubicin in Prostate Cancer Cells: An NADH, FAD and Tryptophan FLIM Assay.', 'Label-Free Optical Metabolic Imaging in Cells and Tissues.', 'Recent trends in two-photon auto-fluorescence lifetime imaging (2P-FLIM) and its biomedical applications.', 'Applications of fluorescence spectroscopy in protein conformational changes and intermolecular contacts.', 'Flavin fluorescence lifetime and autofluorescence optical redox ratio for improved visualization and classification of brain tumors.', 'Two-Photon Excited Fluorescence of NADH-Alcohol Dehydrogenase Complex in a Mixture with Bacterial Enzymes.', 'FLIM of NAD(P)H in Lymphatic Nodes Resolves T-Cell Immune Response to the Tumor.', 'Label-free multimodal nonlinear optical microscopy reveals features of bone composition in pathophysiological conditions.']"""

The PSMA-targeting ability of the 212 Pb-labelled ligands was evaluated using PSMA-positive C4-2 human prostate cancer cells. Lead-212 is an in vivo generator of alpha particles by its daughter nuclides 212 Bi and 212 Po. NG001 was synthesized by conjugating the isothiocyanato group of p-SCN-Bn-TCMC to the amino group of a glutamate-urea-based PSMA-binding entity. Molecular size, chelator unit and chelator linking method are different in NG001 and PSMA-617. Both ligands were efficiently labelled with 212 Pb using a 224 Ra/212 Pb-solution generator in transient equilibrium with progeny. Lead-212-labelled NG001 was purified with a yield of 85.9±4.7% and with 0.7±0.2% of 224 Ra. Compared with [212 Pb]Pb-PSMA-617, [212 Pb]Pb-NG001 displayed a similar binding and internalization in C4-2 cells, with comparable tumour uptake in mice bearing C4-2 tumours, but almost a 2.5-fold lower kidney uptake. Due to the rapid normal tissue clearance and tumour cell internalization, any significant translocalization of 212 Bi was not detected in mice.

The present study investigated the anti-cancer effects of 3,6-diazabicyclo[3.3.1]heptane on LNCaP and PC3 prostate cancer cells in vitro and on tumor growth in vivo in BALB/C nude mice. MATERIAL AND METHODS Reduction of cell viability by 3,6-diazabicyclo[3.3.1]heptane was evaluated by sulphorhodamine-B staining and apoptosis onset using annexin V and propidium iodide (PI) staining. The 2',7'-dichlorofluorescein-diacetate stain was used for assessment of reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation while as western blotting for analysis of protein expression. RESULTS The viability of LNCaP and PC3 cells was reduced significantly (P<0.05) by 3,6-diazabicyclo[3.3.1]heptane in dose-based manner. At 30 µM of 3,6-diazabicyclo[3.3.1]heptane the viability of LNCaP and PC3 cells was reduced to 32 and 28%, respectively. The 3,6-diazabicyclo[3.3.1]heptane treatment increased apoptosis in LNCaP cells to 43.31% at 30 µM. The cell cycle in LNCaP cells was arrested in G1 phase on treatment with 3,6-diazabicyclo[3.3.1]heptane. The expression of cyclin D1 and p21 proteins was significantly increased by 3,6-diazabicyclo[3.3.1]heptane in LNCaP and PC3 cells. The growth of prostate tumor was also suppressed in vivo in mice by 3,6-diazabicyclo[3.3.1]heptane treatment. CONCLUSIONS In summary, the study demonstrated that LNCaP and PC3 prostate cancer cell viability is suppressed by 3,6-diazabicyclo[3.3.1]heptane treatment. The suppression of prostate cancer cell viability by 3,6-diazabicyclo[3.3.1]heptane involves apoptosis induction, cell cycle arrest and upregulation of p21 expression.

This plasticity has been modeled by Rb1/p53 knockdown/knockout and is accompanied by overexpression of the pluripotency factor, Sox2. Here, we explore the role of the developmental transcription factor Sox9 in the process of prostate cancer therapy response and tumor progression.  Experimental design:   Unique prostate cancer cell models that capture AR-/Low stem cell-like intermediates were analyzed for features of plasticity and the functional role of Sox9. Human prostate cancer xenografts and tissue microarrays were evaluated for temporal alterations in Sox9 expression. The role of NF-κB pathway activity in Sox9 overexpression was explored.  Results:   Prostate cancer stem cell-like intermediates have reduced Rb1 and p53 protein expression and overexpress Sox2 as well as Sox9. Sox9 was required for spheroid growth, and overexpression increased invasiveness and neural features of prostate cancer cells. Sox9 was transiently upregulated in castration-induced progression of prostate cancer xenografts and was specifically overexpressed in neoadjuvant hormone therapy (NHT)-treated patient tumors. High Sox9 expression in NHT-treated patients predicts biochemical recurrence. Finally, we link Sox9 induction to NF-κB dimer activation in prostate cancer cells.  Conclusions:   Developmentally reprogrammed prostate cancer cell models recapitulate features of clinically advanced prostate tumors, including downregulated Rb1/p53 and overexpression of Sox2 with Sox9. Sox9 is a marker of a transitional state that identifies prostate cancer cells under the stress of therapeutic assault and facilitates progression to therapy resistance.

Results:   For the 31 men evaluable for response, the median age, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level, and Gleason score were 75 years, 30 ng/mL, and 8 (4 + 4), respectively, which were similar to those for the 23 nonevaluable patients. The treatments received before pembrolizumab were enzalutamide in 26, abiraterone in 18, and sipuleucel-T in 23. All but 4 men had had castrate-resistant disease. Of the 54 men, 31 had completed ≥ 4 cycles of pembrolizumab and were evaluable for the response. Ten men had undergone SBRT to an isolated metastasis shortly before or during pembrolizumab treatment, with the goal of inducing an abscopal effect. The clinical characteristics of the 17 men with a response or stable disease were compared with those of the 14 men with progressive disease. Grade ≥ 2 toxicity occurred in 16 men (30%). PSA stabilization or a response occurred in slightly more than one half (55%) of the men treated with ≥ 4 cycles of pembrolizumab. Five patients had a notable PSA decline of > 50%, which were sustained as long as they had continued receiving pembrolizumab. A PSA response or stabilization was more common for men who had begun taking pembrolizumab with a lower PSA level, fewer bone metastases, and fewer mutations and without previous chemotherapy. A statistically nonsignificant trend toward stabilization or a response was observed in men who had undergone concomitant SBRT.  Conclusion:   Pembrolizumab showed modest anticancer activity against metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer. A PSA response or stabilization occurred more frequently in men with less-advanced disease.""","""['Julianna Higa', 'Kirk Wilenius', 'Shannon Savino', 'Claire Larsen', 'Mark Scholz', 'Nicholas Vogelzang']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Clin Genitourin Cancer""","""['Stereotactic body radiotherapy for oligoprogressive lesions in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer patients during abiraterone/enzalutamide treatment.', 'EAU-ESTRO-SIOG Guidelines on Prostate Cancer.

Questions persist regarding long-term outcomes and the optimal approach to AS.  Objective:   To determine survival and metastatic outcomes in AS patients. Secondary objectives were to measure the cumulative incidence and association of patient-level factors on biopsy grade reclassification.  Design, setting, and participants:   A prospective, active, open-enrollment cohort study was conducted from 1995 through July 2018 at a tertiary-care academic institution. Patients with very-low-risk or low-risk PCa were enrolled.  Intervention:   AS with semiannual prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and digital rectal examination, serial prostate biopsy, and multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI).  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   The 10- and 15-yr cumulative incidences of primary and secondary outcomes were determined.  Results and limitations:   Overall, 1818 men were monitored on AS for a median of 5.0yr (interquartile range 2.0-9.0). There were 88 non-PCa deaths, four PCa deaths, and one additional case of metastasis. The cumulative incidence of PCa-specific mortality or metastasis was 0.1% (95% confidence interval, 0.04-0.6%) at both 10 and 15yr. The 5-, 10-, and 15-yr cumulative incidences of biopsy grade reclassification were 21%, 30%, and 32%, respectively. On multivariable analysis, biopsy grade reclassification was associated with older age, African-American race, PSA density, and increased cancer volume on biopsy, and men who underwent mpMRI prior to enrollment were less likely to undergo grade reclassification. Our selection and monitoring are more stringent than many other contemporary AS programs.  Conclusions:   In a large, single-institution, prospective AS cohort, the risk of cancer death or metastasis was <1% over long-term follow-up. Consistent with clinical guidelines, these data support the use of AS for the management of most men diagnosed with GG1 PCa.  Patient summary:   This study investigated long-term outcomes in patients with grade group 1 prostate cancer managed with active surveillance (AS). Ten years after enrolling in AS, the risk of metastasis or death from prostate cancer was <1%, while 48% of men switched to treatment. Patients who underwent multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI)/ultrasound-fusion targeted biopsy prior to enrollment were less likely to experience biopsy grade reclassification during follow-up, suggesting a role for mpMRI as part of a comprehensive risk assessment to confirm AS eligibility. These findings support the safety of AS in most men with grade group 1 prostate cancer, but specific outcomes may differ in programs with less intensive monitoring.""","""['Jeffrey J Tosoian', 'Mufaddal Mamawala', 'Jonathan I Epstein', 'Patricia Landis', 'Katarzyna J Macura', 'Demetrios N Simopoulos', 'H Ballentine Carter', 'Michael A Gorin']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Eur Urol""","""['Active Surveillance for Prostate Cancer: A 2020 Vision.', 'Re: Jeffrey J.

This randomised trial compared the performance and acceptability of two new decision aids (DAs) to aid men in making informed choices about PSA screening.  Methods:   ~3000 Australian men 45-60 years with varying educational attainment were recruited via an online panel and randomised to view one of two online decision aids (one full length, one abbreviated) and completed a questionnaire. The primary outcome was informed choice about PSA screening.  Findings:   Significantly more men in the long DA group (38%) made an informed choice than men who received the shorter DA (33%) (95% CI 1.1% to 8.2%; p = 0.008). On knowledge, the long DA group scored, on average, 0.45 points higher than the short DA group (95% CI 0.14 to 0.76; p = 0.004) and 5% more of the participants achieved an adequate knowledge score (95% CI 1.9% to 8.8%; p = 0.002). Men allocated the long DA were less likely to intend to have a PSA test in the future (53%) than men in the short DA group (59%). Both DAs rated highly on acceptability.  Conclusions:   Both DAs were useful and acceptable to men regardless of education level and both supported informed decision making. The long version resulted in higher knowledge, and a higher proportion of men able to make an informed choice, but the differences were small.

Mounting evidence suggests that prostate cancer deposits exist within a hypoxic environment and this contributes to radio-resistance thus hampering one of the major therapies for this cancer. Recent reports have shown that nitric oxide (NO) donating non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) reduced tumour hypoxia as well as maintaining a radio-sensitising/therapeutic effect on prostate cancer cells. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of hypoxia on the proteome of the prostate and to establish whether NO-NSAID treatment reverted the protein profiles back to their normoxic status. To this end an established hormone insensitive prostate cancer cell line, PC-3, was cultured under hypoxic and normoxic conditions before and following exposure to NO-NSAID in combination with selected other common prostate cancer treatment types. The extracted proteins were analysed by ion mobility-assisted data independent acquisition mass spectrometry (MS), combined with multivariate statistical analyses, to measure hypoxia-induced alterations in the proteome of these cells. The analyses demonstrated that under hypoxic conditions there were well-defined, significantly regulated/differentially expressed proteins primarily involved with structural and binding processes including, for example, TUBB4A, CIRP and PLOD1. Additionally, the exposure of hypoxic cells to NSAID and NO-NSAID agents, resulted in some of these proteins being differentially expressed; for example, both PCNA and HNRNPA1L were down-regulated, corresponding with disruption in the nucleocytoplasmic shuttling process.""","""['James A Ross', 'Johannes P C Vissers', 'Jyoti Nanda', 'Grant D Stewart', 'Holger Husi', 'Fouad K Habib', 'Dean E Hammond', 'Lee A Gethings']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Clin Chem Lab Med""","""['Proteins upregulated by mild and severe hypoxia in squamous cell carcinomas in vitro identified by proteomics.', 'NO-sulindac inhibits the hypoxia response of PC-3 prostate cancer cells via the Akt signalling pathway.', 'Ibuprofen-mediated reduction of hypoxia-inducible factors HIF-1alpha and HIF-2alpha in prostate cancer cells.', 'HIF1α expression under normoxia in prostate cancer--which pathways to target?', 'Tumor cell hypoxia and the hypoxia-response signaling system as a target for prostate cancer therapy.', 'Identification of TUBB4A as a Prognostic Biomarker of Melanoma by Transcriptomic Data and In Vitro Experiments.', 'Antisense lncRNA PCNA-AS1 promotes esophageal squamous cell carcinoma progression through the miR-2467-3p/PCNA axis.', 'TUBB4A interacts with MYH9 to protect the nucleus during cell migration and promotes prostate cancer via GSK3β/β-catenin signalling.', 'The Etiology and Pathophysiology Genesis of Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia and Prostate Cancer: A New Perspective.', 'Temporal Quantitative Proteomics Reveals Proteomic and Phosphoproteomic Alterations Associated with Adaptive Response to Hypoxia in Melanoma Cells.']"""

Objective:   To assess out-of-pocket costs and total payments for 5 types of common oncologic procedures that can be performed using an open or robotic approach.  Design, setting, and participants:   A retrospective, cross-sectional, propensity score-weighted analysis was performed using deidentified insurance claims for 1.9 million enrollees from the MarketScan database from January 1, 2012, to December 31, 2017. The final study sample comprised 15 893 US adults aged 18 to 64 years who were enrolled in an employer-sponsored health plan. Patients underwent either an open or robotic radical prostatectomy, hysterectomy, partial colectomy, radical nephrectomy, or partial nephrectomy for a solid-organ malignant neoplasm.

Methods:   Data from the Dutch population-based patient-reported outcomes following initial treatment and long-term evaluation of survivorship (PROFILES) registry collected between 2009 and 2012 were used. EORTC QLQ-C30 data were used to estimate utility values by applying the EORTC QLU-C10D instrument using Australian utility weights. Regression analyses were conducted, within and across cancer type, to examine the factors influencing utility values, including patient- and cancer-specific factors, as well as the EORTC QLQ-C30 scale/item scores.  Results:   The mean utility value for the total cancer sample was 0.791 (SD 0.201), significantly lower than that from the general population (0.865, SD 0.165). Multiple myeloma patients had the lowest utility value at 0.663 (SD 0.244). Physical functioning, pain and nausea and vomiting were the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) domains with the greatest impact on utility values; cognitive functioning and dyspnea had the lowest impact. Of the demographic and clinical factors, unemployment for reasons other than retirement, age older than 75 years, number of comorbidities, and experience of symptoms all had a statistically significant negative impact on utility values.

The immune checkpoint molecules PD-1 and PD-L1 have been targeted for cancer treatment with significant benefits for cancer patients. However, the response rate is relatively low in certain types of cancer and the underlying mechanism remains poorly understood. Better understanding of the molecular mechanism of PD-L1 expression regulation in cancer cells is urgently needed to improve the treatment response rate and overall survival of patients. Fructose-1, 6-biphosphatase (FBP1) is a key enzyme in gluconeogenesis and is implicated in human cancer due to its frequent loss in various cancer types. Methods: Expression of FBP1 and PD-L1 was analyzed in various cancer cell lines. Western blot and RT-qPCR were performed to determine whether FBP1 regulates PD-L1 expression. Co-immunoprecipitation and glutathione S-transferase (GST) pulldown assay were employed to define the underlying regulatory mechanisms. Immunohistochemistry was conducted to determine the correlation between FBP1 and PD-L1 expression in a cohort of patients. A cancer syngeneic mouse model was utilized to examine how FBP1 affects tumor immunity. Results: We demonstrated that in a manner independent of its enzymatic activity FBP1 downregulates the expression of PD-L1 in various cell lines of different cancer types including pancreatic and prostate cancer. We further showed that this regulation occurs at the transcriptional level and is mediated by FBP1 inhibition of signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 (STAT3)-dependent PD-L1 transcription. Moreover, FBP1 and PD-L1 protein expression were negatively correlated in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) specimens from a cohort of patients. Most importantly, we demonstrated that decreased FBP1 expression promotes tumor growth and resistance to immune checkpoint blockade therapy in mice. Conclusions: Our findings reveal a new tumor suppressor function of FBP1 in inhibiting PD-L1 expression and enhancing cancer immunity. They also suggest that FBP1-deficient human cancers could be therapeutically targeted by PD-1/PD-L1-based immune checkpoint blockade therapy.""","""['Bo Wang', 'Yingke Zhou', 'Jun Zhang', 'Xin Jin', 'Heshui Wu', 'Haojie Huang']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Theranostics""","""['Overexpressed ITGA2 promotes malignant tumor aggression by up-regulating PD-L1 expression through the activation of the STAT3 signaling pathway.', 'Regulation of PD-L1: a novel role of pro-survival signalling in cancer.', 'Overexpressed histone acetyltransferase 1 regulates cancer immunity by increasing programmed death-ligand 1 expression in pancreatic cancer.', 'Shikonin-mediated PD-L1 degradation suppresses immune evasion in pancreatic cancer by inhibiting NF-κB/STAT3 and NF-κB/CSN5 signaling pathways.', 'Communication between EMT and PD-L1 signaling: New insights into tumor immune evasion.', ""STAT3 and Its Pathways' Dysregulation-Underestimated Role in Urological Tumors."", 'Immune checkpoint blockade in pancreatic cancer: Trudging through the immune desert.', 'Sesquiterpene Lactones and Cancer: New Insight into Antitumor and Anti-inflammatory Effects of Parthenolide-Derived Dimethylaminomicheliolide and Micheliolide.', 'What Do We Have to Know about PD-L1 Expression in Prostate Cancer?

This study aimed to explore the role of LINC00908 in prostate cancer (PCa) and its possible underlying mechanisms.  Methods:   Microarray data associated with PCa were obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) to screen the differentially expressed genes or lncRNAs. Then, the expression of LINC00908 in PCa tissues and cell lines was detected by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). The localization of LINC00908 in PCa cells was examined by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). The relationship among LINC00908, microRNA (miR)-483-5p, and TSPYL5 was detected by bioinformatics analysis, dual-luciferase reporter assay, RNA pull-down, RNA binding protein immunoprecipitation (RIP), and FISH assays. Cell biological behaviors were assessed after the expression of LINC00908, miR-483-5p, and TSPYL5 was altered in PCa cells. Lastly, tumor growth in nude mice was evaluated.  Results:   Poorly expressed LINC00908 was witnessed in PCa tissues and cells. LINC00908 competitively bound to miR-483-5p to up-regulate the TSPYL5 expression. Overexpression of LINC00908 resulted in reduced PCa cell proliferation, migration and invasion, and promoted apoptosis. Additionally, the suppression on PCa cell proliferation, migration and invasion was induced by up-regulation of TSPYL5 or inhibition of miR-483-5p. In addition, in vivo experiments showed that overexpression of LINC00908 inhibited tumor growth of PCa.  Conclusion:   Overall, LINC00908 could competitively bind to miR-483-5p to increase the expression of TSPYL5, thereby inhibiting the progression of PCa.

The role of microRNAs (miRs) has been widely investigated in prostate cancer with both diagnostic and prognostic potential. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between circulating miRs and treatment outcome in mCRPC patients. The relative expression of five miRs (miR-93-5p, -125b-1-5p, -141-3p, -221-3p, and miR-375-3p) was investigated in plasma samples from 84 mCRPC patients; 40 patients were treated with docetaxel (DOC cohort) and 44 patients with abiraterone (ABI cohort). Blood was sampled at baseline before treatment start and at radiological progression. The plasma levels of four miRs; miR-93-5p, -141-3p, -221-3p, and miR-375-3p decreased significantly after treatment initiation in patients receiving docetaxel, and for miR-141-3p and miR-375-3p the level increased again at the time of radiological progression. In the patients treated with abiraterone, the plasma level of miR-221-3p likewise decreased significantly after the first treatment cycle. High baseline levels of both miR-141-3p and miR-375-3p were significantly associated with a shorter time to radiological progression in both cohorts. Additionally, high baseline levels of miR-141-3p and miR-221-3p were significantly associated with a shorter overall survival (OS) in the ABI cohort, while high levels of miR-141-3p and miR-375-3p were significantly associated with shorter OS in the DOC cohort. Plasma levels of miR-141-3p and miR-375-3p may predict time to progression in mCRPC patients treated with docetaxel or abiraterone.

Detailed molecular characterization of the neuroblastoma genomic landscape indicates that ALK-activating mutations are present in 10% of primary tumours. Together with other mutations causing RAS/MAPK pathway activation, ALK mutations are also enriched in relapsed cases and ALK activation was shown to accelerate MYCN-driven tumour formation through hitherto unknown ALK-driven target genes. To gain further insight into how ALK contributes to neuroblastoma aggressiveness, we searched for known oncogenes in our previously reported ALK-driven gene signature. We identified ETV5, a bona fide oncogene in prostate cancer, as robustly upregulated in neuroblastoma cells harbouring ALK mutations, and show high ETV5 levels downstream of the RAS/MAPK axis. Increased ETV5 expression significantly impacted migration, invasion and colony formation in vitro, and ETV5 knockdown reduced proliferation in a murine xenograft model. We also established a gene signature associated with ETV5 knockdown that correlates with poor patient survival.

However, it is not associated with PSA or radiographic response, which poses a challenge in real-time assessment of its efficacy. Surrogate markers of treatment outcomes may facilitate tailoring treatment duration with radium-223, by limiting the duration of therapy with radium-223 in these patients. Here, we sought to investigate the utility of bone metabolic markers (BMMs) as surrogate markers of response to radium-223 in mCRPC.  Patients and methods:   A prospective phase II trial of radium-223 plus enzalutamide (RE) versus enzalutamide alone was designed to assess surrogacy of BMMs with respect to response to radium-223. Enzalutamide was used as a comparator in lieu of placebo due to the progressive disease. Co-primary endpoints were relative change in serum BMM N-telopeptide (NTP) levels from baseline to 6 months between the two arms and safety and feasibility of the combination.  Results:   Thirty-nine men were randomized to RE (n = 27) or enzalutamide (n = 12). Combination was safe and feasible. Primary endpoint was met. A statistically significant relative change to NTP ratios between arms (0.64, 95% confidence interval, 0.51-0.81; P = 0.00048) favored RE versus enzalutamide. Overall, BMMs decreased with the RE therapy compared with enzalutamide. Improved PSA response rate in RE versus enzalutamide (P = 0.024), correlated with decline in BMMs.  Conclusions:   BMMs declined significantly with combination therapy, and were associated with improved outcomes. Upon external validation, BMMs may emerge as surrogate markers to monitor treatment with radium-223 in real-time.""","""['Neeraj Agarwal#', 'Roberto Nussenzveig', 'Andrew W Hahn', 'John M Hoffman', 'Kathryn Morton', 'Sumati Gupta', 'Julia Batten', 'Jared Thorley', 'Josiah Hawks', 'Victor Sacristan Santos', 'Gayatri Nachaegari', 'Xuechen Wang', 'Kenneth Boucher', 'Benjamin Haaland', 'Benjamin L Maughan#']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Clin Cancer Res""","""['The PREVAIL Study: Primary Outcomes by Site and Extent of Baseline Disease for Enzalutamide-treated Men with Chemotherapy-naïve Metastatic Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'A randomized phase IIa study of quantified bone scan response in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) treated with radium-223 dichloride alone or in combination with abiraterone acetate/prednisone or enzalutamide.', 'Improved outcomes in elderly patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer treated with the androgen receptor inhibitor enzalutamide: results from the phase III AFFIRM trial.', 'Current approaches to incorporation of radium-223 in clinical practice.', 'Radium-223 dichloride in patients with castration-refractory prostate cancer.', 'Enhanced Antitumor Efficacy of Radium-223 and Enzalutamide in the Intratibial LNCaP Prostate Cancer Model.', 'A Treatment Paradigm Shift: Targeted Radionuclide Therapies for Metastatic Castrate Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Emerging Biomarker-Guided Therapies in Prostate Cancer.', 'Correlation Between Imaging-Based Intermediate Endpoints and Overall Survival in Men With Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer: Analysis of 28 Randomized Trials Using the Prostate Cancer Clinical Trials Working Group (PCWG2) Criteria in 16,511 Patients.', 'Biomarkers for Treatment Response in Advanced Prostate Cancer.']"""

Recent reports demonstrated the great breakthroughs made by the chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR-T) cell therapy, which is significantly different from traditional T cells therapies. In spite of the progress of CAR-T technology in the treatment of lymphoma, leukemia, and other blood system tumor, there are still many difficulties in the treatment of solid tumors by CAR-T technology.  Methods:   In this report, we designed a panel of IL23mAb-PSMA-CARs, including PSMA-CAR, IL23mAb-T2A-PSMA-CAR, IL23mAb-PSMA-CAR, and PSMA-CAR (soluble IL23mAb). And we studied the function of these CARs in mice model.  Results:   Co-culture experiments with different CAR T cells have normal lysis function in vitro. The duo-CAR T cells co-expressing the IL-23mAb and PSMA-mAb had a significant higher population than the rest three different CAR T cells in co-culturing experiments at day 28, 35 and 42. A panel of cytokines were differentially secreted at higher amounts in IL23mAb-T2A-PSMA-CAR T cells than CAR T cells in other groups. In NOD/SCID IL-2 gamma (NSG) mice model, IL23mAb-T2A-PSMA-CAR T cells functioned significantly better than CAR T cells from the other groups and eradicated the tumor from these mice starting at day 14 post T cells injection and regained the body weight immediately. In IL23mAb-T2A-PSMA-CAR mice, CD45RO+ CD8+ T cells and CD127+ CD4+ CAR T cells were significantly increased. RNA sequencing revealed a difference expression pattern of genes in IL23mAb-T2A-PSMA-CAR mice. A reverse infusion experiment under the same model further proved the tumor eradication function of IL23mAb-T2A-PSMA-CAR T cells.

Objective:   To evaluate localization agreement between mpMRI lesions and histology obtained by cognitive PB and radical prostatectomy (RP) surgical specimen (SS).  Methods:   Out of 115 consecutive cognitive biopsied patients, 37 with positive PB were studied. Sample was characterized regarding age, prostatic volume, PI-RADS, location of lesion on mpMRI, lesion dimension, total number of fragments obtain by PB, number of fragments directed to the lesion, number of fragments with prostatic adenocarcinoma (PCa) and ISUP classification. The relationship between mpMRI and SS piece was analysed in 15 patients who underwent RP.  Results:   Regarding agreement between mpMRI and PB, agreement of location was observed in 26 (70.3%); 7 (18.9%) presented PCa positive fragments in the suspected zone plus others in the same lobe; 3 (8.1%) in the suspected zone plus the contralateral lobe and 1 (2.7%) had no PCa in the suspected zone but had bilateral PCa. The total number of fragments with PCa was lower in cases with agreement between mpMRI and PB (p < 0.05). Regarding agreement between mpMRI and SS, 5 cases (33.3%) presented the same location as described by mpMRI, 5 (33.3%) showed ipsilateral lesions in other zones of the prostate; 4 (26.7%) presented extensive bilateral lesions on all prostate zones and 1 (6.7%) showed previously unknown contralateral lesions.

Materials and methods:   Data of 117 of symptomatic patients for bladder outflow obstruction who subsequently underwent to HoLEP was retrospectively analyzed form a multicentric database. All patients had a raised serum PSA and/or an abnormal digital rectal examination (DRE) with a pre-interventional mpMRI. Prostate cancer was excluded either with an en-bore MRI-GB (group ""IN-BORE MRI-GB"" n = 57) in case of a suspect area at the mpMRI or with a standard biopsy (group ""mpMRI + TRUS-GB"" n = 60) in case of a negative mpMRI. Preoperative characteristic surgical and histological outcomes were analyzed. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression model was performed to investigate independent predictors of incidental Prostate Cancer (iPCa).  Results:   Both groups presented moderate to severe lower tract urinary symptoms: median IPSS was 19 (IQR: 17.0-22.0) in the IN-BORE MRI-GB group and 20 (IQR: 17.5-22.0) in the mpMRI + TRUS-GB (p = 0.71).

Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) is well known to have diverse bioactivities including anti-cancer effects. However, the efficacy of EGCG on VM is elusive. In this study, we explored whether and how EGCG affects VM in human prostate cancer (PCa) PC-3 cells. Cell viability was measured by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. Invasive and VM formation abilities were assessed by an invasion assay and a three-dimensional (3D) culture VM tube formation assay, respectively. Western blots were carried out. An immunofluorescence assay was performed to detect nuclear twist expression. EGCG effectively inhibited the invasive ability, as well as tubular channel formation, without affecting cell viability. EGCG significantly downregulated the expression of vascular endothelial cadherin (VE-cadherin) and its transcription factor, twist, N-cadherin, vimentin, phosphor-AKT, and AKT, but not phospho-erythropoietin-producing hepatocellular receptor A2 (EphA2) and EphA2. In addition, EGCG diminished the nuclear localization of twist. Treatment with SC79, an AKT activator, effectively rescued EGCG-inhibited VM formation. These results demonstrated for the first time that EGCG causes marked suppression of VM through inhibiting the twist/VE-cadherin/AKT pathway in human PCa PC-3 cells.""","""['Changhwan Yeo', 'Deok-Soo Han', 'Hyo-Jeong Lee', 'Eun-Ok Lee']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Int J Mol Sci""","""['Resveratrol suppresses serum-induced vasculogenic mimicry through impairing the EphA2/twist-VE-cadherin/AKT pathway in human prostate cancer PC-3 cells.', 'Sp1 Plays a Key Role in Vasculogenic Mimicry of Human Prostate Cancer Cells.', 'Serum promotes vasculogenic mimicry through the EphA2/VE-cadherin/AKT pathway in PC-3 human prostate cancer cells.', 'Vasculogenic mimicry signaling revisited: focus on non-vascular VE-cadherin.', 'VE-Cadherin in Cancer-Associated Angiogenesis: A Deceptive Strategy of Blood Vessel Formation.', 'L1CAM promotes vasculogenic mimicry formation by miR-143-3p-induced expression of hexokinase 2 in glioma.', 'Resveratrol suppresses serum-induced vasculogenic mimicry through impairing the EphA2/twist-VE-cadherin/AKT pathway in human prostate cancer PC-3 cells.', 'Phytochemicals in Inhibition of Prostate Cancer: Evidence from Molecular Mechanisms Studies.', 'Sp1 Plays a Key Role in Vasculogenic Mimicry of Human Prostate Cancer Cells.', 'Prostate cancer: Therapeutic prospect with herbal medicine.']"""

Analyses included intergroup comparison of CTC counts, determined using the CellSearch® system, EPISPOT assay and GILUPI CellCollector®, and ROC analysis verifying the accuracy of CTC count as a maker of disseminated prostate cancer. The vast majority (94.7%) of patients with advanced-stage cancer tested positively for CTCs in at least one of the assays. However, significantly higher CTC counts were determined with the CellSearch® system compared to EPISPOT assay and GILUPI CellCollector®. Identification of ≥4 CTCs with the CellSearch® system was the most accurate predictor of metastatic disease (sensitivity 0.500; specificity 0.900; AUC (95% CI) 0.760 (0.613-0.908). Furthermore, we tried to create a model to enhance the specificity and sensitivity of metastatic prediction with CTC counts by incorporating patient's clinical data, including PSA serum levels, Gleason score and clinical stage. The composite biomarker panel achieved the following performance: sensitivity, 0.611; specificity, 0.971; AUC (95% CI), 0.901 (0.810-0.993).

Long non-coding RNA metastasis-associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1 (MALAT1) has been reported to be implicated in tumorigenesis and progression of PCa. However, the pathogenesis of MALAT1 in PCa has not been thoroughly elaborated.  Methods:   RT-qPCR assay was conducted to measure expression of MALAT1, microRNA-140 (miR-140) and Baculoviral IAP repeat containing 6 (BIRC6) mRNA. Protein expression of BIRC6 was detected by western blot assay. Cell proliferative ability was assessed by MTS and Edu retention assays. Cell migratory and invasive abilities were evaluated by wound healing assay and Transwell invasion assay, respectively. Cell apoptotic rate was examined using a flow cytometry. The interaction between miR-140 and MALAT1 or BIRC6 3'UTR was explored by luciferase, RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) and RNA pull down assays. Xenograft models of PCa were established to further explore the role and molecular mechanism of MALAT in PCa tumorigenesis in vivo.  Results:   MALAT1 and BIRC6 were highly expressed in human PCa tumor tissues and cell lines. MALAT1 or BIRC6 knockdown inhibited cell proliferation, migration and invasion and induced cell apoptosis in PCa. MiR-140 could directly bind with MALAT1 or BIRC6 3'UTR. Moreover, MALAT1 knockdown inhibited BIRC mRNA and protein expression through upregulating miR-140 in PCa cells. Additionally, MALAT1 knockdown inhibited PCa xenograft tumor growth by regulating miR-140/BIRC6 axis in vivo.

Objective:   To compare functional outcomes associated with prostate cancer treatments over 5 years after treatment.  Design, setting, and participants:   Prospective, population-based cohort study of 1386 men with favorable-risk (clinical stage cT1 to cT2bN0M0, prostate-specific antigen [PSA] ≤20 ng/mL, and Grade Group 1-2) prostate cancer and 619 men with unfavorable-risk (clinical stage cT2cN0M0, PSA of 20-50 ng/mL, or Grade Group 3-5) prostate cancer diagnosed in 2011 through 2012, accrued from 5 Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results Program sites and a US prostate cancer registry, with surveys through September 2017.  Exposures:   Treatment with active surveillance (n = 363), nerve-sparing prostatectomy (n = 675), external beam radiation therapy (EBRT; n = 261), or low-dose-rate brachytherapy (n = 87) for men with favorable-risk disease and treatment with prostatectomy (n = 402) or EBRT with androgen deprivation therapy (n = 217) for men with unfavorable-risk disease.  Main outcomes and measures:   Patient-reported function, based on the 26-item Expanded Prostate Index Composite (range, 0-100), 5 years after treatment. Regression models were adjusted for baseline function and patient and tumor characteristics. Minimum clinically important difference was 10 to 12 for sexual function, 6 to 9 for urinary incontinence, 5 to 7 for urinary irritative symptoms, and 4 to 6 for bowel and hormonal function.  Results:   A total of 2005 men met inclusion criteria and completed the baseline and at least 1 postbaseline survey (median [interquartile range] age, 64 [59-70] years; 1529 of 1993 participants [77%] were non-Hispanic white). For men with favorable-risk prostate cancer, nerve-sparing prostatectomy was associated with worse urinary incontinence at 5 years (adjusted mean difference, -10.9 [95% CI, -14.2 to -7.6]) and sexual function at 3 years (adjusted mean difference, -15.2 [95% CI, -18.8 to -11.5]) compared with active surveillance. Low-dose-rate brachytherapy was associated with worse urinary irritative (adjusted mean difference, -7.0 [95% CI, -10.1 to -3.9]), sexual (adjusted mean difference, -10.1 [95% CI, -14.6 to -5.7]), and bowel (adjusted mean difference, -5.0 [95% CI, -7.6 to -2.4]) function at 1 year compared with active surveillance. EBRT was associated with urinary, sexual, and bowel function changes not clinically different from active surveillance at any time point through 5 years.

Objective:   To determine the effect of a behavioral intervention that increased vegetable intake on cancer progression in men with early-stage prostate cancer.  Design, setting, and participants:   The Men's Eating and Living (MEAL) Study (CALGB 70807 [Alliance]) was a randomized clinical trial conducted at 91 US urology and medical oncology clinics that enrolled 478 men aged 50 to 80 years with biopsy-proven prostate adenocarcinoma (International Society of Urological Pathology grade group = 1 in those <70 years and ≤2 in those ≥70 years), stage cT2a or less, and serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level less than 10 ng/mL. Enrollment occurred from January 2011 to August 2015; 24-month follow-up occurred from January 2013 to August 2017.  Interventions:   Patients were randomized to a counseling behavioral intervention by telephone promoting consumption of 7 or more daily vegetable servings (MEAL intervention; n = 237) or a control group, which received written information about diet and prostate cancer (n = 241).  Main outcomes and measures:   The primary outcome was time to progression; progression was defined as PSA level of 10 ng/mL or greater, PSA doubling time of less than 3 years, or upgrading (defined as increase in tumor volume or grade) on follow-up prostate biopsy.  Results:   Among 478 patients randomized (mean [SD] age, 64 [7] years; mean [SD] PSA level, 4.9 [2.1] ng/mL), 443 eligible patients (93%) were included in the primary analysis. There were 245 progression events (intervention: 124; control: 121). There were no significant differences in time to progression (unadjusted hazards ratio, 0.96 [95% CI, 0.75 to 1.24]; adjusted hazard ratio, 0.97 [95% CI, 0.76 to 1.25]). The 24-month Kaplan-Meier progression-free percentages were 43.5% [95% CI, 36.5% to 50.6%] and 41.4% [95% CI, 34.3% to 48.7%] for the intervention and control groups, respectively (difference, 2.1% [95% CI, -8.1% to 12.2%]).  Conclusions and relevance:   Among men with early-stage prostate cancer managed with active surveillance, a behavioral intervention that increased vegetable consumption did not significantly reduce the risk of prostate cancer progression. The findings do not support use of this intervention to decrease prostate cancer progression in this population, although the study may have been underpowered to identify a clinically important difference.

In flow cytometry, however, the long lifetime poses a significant challenge to measure wherein the detection window is often too short to determine the decay characteristics. Here we report a time-resolved microfluidic flow cytometer (tr-mFCM) incorporating an acoustic-focusing chip, which allows slowing down of the flow while providing the same detection conditions for every target, achieving accurate lifetime measurement free of autofluorescence interference. Through configuration of the flow velocity and detection aperture with respect to the time-gating sequence, a multi-cycle luminescence decay profile is captured for every event under maximum excitation and detection efficiency. A custom fitting algorithm is then developed to resolve europium-stained polymer microspheres as well as leukemia cells against abundant fluorescent particles, achieving counting efficiency approaching 100% and lifetime CVs (coefficient of variation) around 2-6%. We further demonstrate lifetime-multiplexed detection of prostate and bladder cancer cells stained with different europium probes.

In the current study, we found that mRNA levels of ARHGAP10 were significantly higher in prostate cancer tissues than in the non-cancerous controls. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) revealed that ARHGAP10 expression was negatively correlated with the Wnt signaling pathway. Immunohistochemical staining results showed that 62.2% (56/90) and 65.5% (59/90) of prostate cancer tissues displayed low expression of ARHGAP10 and high expression of β-catenin, respectively. ARHGAP10 protein expression was significantly correlated with histologic grade (P < 0.0001), tumor stage (P = 0.0298), preoperative prostate specific antigen level (P = 0.0261), vital status (P = 0.0017) and β-catenin expression (P < 0.0001). Kaplan-Meier survival analysis indicated that patients with low levels of ARHGAP10 and high levels of β-catenin had poor overall survival. Multivariate analyses revealed that ARHGAP10 and β-catenin expression was independent prognostic factor for prostate cancer.

Results:   The expression levels of miR-30a in human BC tumor tissues were significantly lower than they were in the adjacent normal tissues (P < 0.001), and significantly higher in β-catenin protein (P < 0.001), but there was no significant different in β-catenin mRNA (P = 0.3816). The immunohistochemistry results showed that β-catenin protein was only expressed on the cell membrane in paracancerous normal tissues, but β-catenin protein was expressed on the cell membrane and cytoplasm in BC tumor cells.

Results:   CYP17A1 was strongly expressed in the cytoplasm of PCa cells (median 50% of cancer cells, range 0-100%). The nuclear AR expression in cancer cells was directly related with CYP17A1 (p < 0.0001, r = 0.51).

Materials and methods:   A total of 55 patients were recruited prospectively. Intra-fractional position of the prostate was monitored in real-time using a 4D TPUS Clarity® system. A total of 1745 monitoring sessions were analysed. Van Herk's margin recipe (2.5∑ + 1.64((σ2 + σp2)1/2 - σp)) was used to estimate the duration-dependant margins for every minute, up to the 15th minute. Linear regression analysis was then performed on the overall margins against time and direction.  Results:   The mean intra-fractional position was 0.76 mm Inferior (Inf), 0 mm Lateral (Lat) and 0.94 mm Posterior (Post) at the 15th minute. A minimum margin expansion of 2.42 mm (Superior/Inf), 1.02 mm (Left/Right) and 2.65 mm (Anterior/Post) was required for an 8‑minute treatment compared to 4.29 mm (Sup/Inf), 1.84 mm (Lt/Rt) and 4.63 mm (Ant/Post) for a 15-minute treatment. The required margin expansion increased linearly (R2 = 0.99) in all directions (p < 0.01). However, while there was no statistically significant difference (p = 0.10) in the required margin expansion in the Sup/Inf and Ant/Post directions respective of the time duration, the margins were much bigger compared to those in the Lt/Rt direction (p < 0.01).

The required margin increases linearly in all directions within the 15-min duration; thus, the margin will depend on the duration of the technique chosen (IMRT/VMAT/3DCRT/proton).""","""['Eric Pei Ping Pang', 'Kellie Knight', 'Sung Yong Park', 'Weixiang Lian', 'Zubin Master', 'Marilyn Baird', 'Jason Wei Xiang Chan', 'Michael Lian Chek Wang', 'Terence Wee Kiat Tan', 'Melvin L K Chua', 'Eu Tiong Chua', 'Wen Shen Looi', 'Wen Long Nei', 'Jeffrey Kit Loong Tuan']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Strahlenther Onkol""","""['Evaluation of intrafractional prostate displacement during prostate radiotherapy using real-time ultrasound system.', 'Determination of Intrafraction Prostate Motion During External Beam Radiation Therapy With a\xa0Transperineal 4-Dimensional Ultrasound Real-Time Tracking System.', 'Evaluation of intrafraction prostate motion tracking using the Clarity Autoscan system for safety margin validation.', 'Analysis of intra-fraction prostate motion and derivation of duration-dependent margins for radiotherapy using real-time 4D ultrasound.', 'Adaptive optimization by 6 DOF robotic couch in prostate volumetric IMRT treatment: rototranslational shift and dosimetric consequences.', 'Evaluation of intrafractional prostate displacement during prostate radiotherapy using real-time ultrasound system.', 'Evaluation of internal margins for prostate for step and shoot intensity-modulated radiation therapy and volumetric modulated arc therapy using different margin formulas.', 'Technical considerations for positioning and placement of a transperineal ultrasound probe during prostate radiotherapy.']"""

To characterize the objective biological features of the different morphological components such as Gleason patterns (GP) in prostate cancer, biopsy specimens containing only single pure GP (GP3, GP4, GP5) are used to analyze the relationship between PVT1 expression and MYC protein expression. The expressions of PVT1 and MYC were analyzed by quantitative PCR and the labeling index (LI) of MYC protein by immunohistochemical staining. PVT1, MYC, and MYC protein were highly expressed in GP 4, and interestingly the expression between PVT1 and MYC LI significantly correlated only in GP 4. In vitro experiments, the expression of MYC protein was slightly reduced by small interfering RNA against PVT1, while strongly reduced against specifically circular PVT1, splicing variants derived from the PVT1.

The aim of this study is to investigate the underlying glucose metabolism mechanisms of 18F-FDG-uptake on PET/CT imaging in PCa.  Methods:   Retrospective analysis was conducted for 94 patients diagnosed with a Gleason sum ≥8 adenocarcinoma of the prostate at biopsy between July 2011 and July 2014 who underwent 18F-FDG-PET/CT imaging before radical prostatectomy (RP). 18F-FDG-uptake in primary lesion was measured by a blinded reader using maximum standardised uptake value (SUVmax). GLUT1, GLUT12 and HK2 expression were blindly scored after immunohistochemistry on specimens RP by three pathologists. Correlations between GLUT1, GLUT12 and HK2, and SUVmax were assessed using Spearman's rank correlation test. Survival probabilities were based on the Kaplan-Meier method.  Results:   With a median follow-up of 4.5 years, 56% (n = 53) of patients had biochemical recurrence (BCR), 7% (n = 7) progressed to castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) disease, 13% (n = 12) developed metastasis and 6% (n = 6) died. Correlation was found between GLUT1 expression and SUVmax level (r = 0.25, p = 0.02). In addition, SUVmax was significantly higher in tumours with high GLUT1 expression (n = 17, 5.74 ± 1.67) than tumours with low GLUT1 expression (n = 71, 2.68 ± 0.31, p = 0.004). Moreover, a significant association was found between GLUT1 expression levels and SUVmax level (p = 0.005), lymph node status (p = 0.05), volume of cancer (p = 0.01), CRPC disease progression (p = 0.02) and metastasis development (p = 0.04). No significant difference between GLUT12 and HEX2 expression and SUVmax have been found.  Conclusions:   GLUT1 expression in PCa tumours correlates with 18F-FDG-uptake and poor prognostic factors.

Castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) is a lethal stage of the disease that emerges when endocrine therapies are no longer effective at suppressing activity of the androgen receptor (AR) transcription factor. The purpose of this study was to identify genomic mechanisms that contribute to the development and progression of CRPC.  Experimental design:   We used whole-genome and targeted DNA-sequencing approaches to identify mechanisms underlying CRPC in an aggregate cohort of 272 prostate cancer patients. We analyzed structural rearrangements at the genome-wide level and carried out a detailed structural rearrangement analysis of the AR locus. We used genome engineering to perform experimental modeling of AR gene rearrangements and long-read RNA sequencing to analyze effects on expression of AR and truncated AR variants (AR-V).  Results: AR was among the most frequently rearranged genes in CRPC tumors. AR gene rearrangements promoted expression of diverse AR-V species. AR gene rearrangements occurring in the context of AR amplification correlated with AR overexpression. Cell lines with experimentally derived AR gene rearrangements displayed high expression of tumor-specific AR-Vs and were resistant to endocrine therapies, including the AR antagonist enzalutamide.

Here, we identify that high levels of cell surface receptor Trop2 are predictive of recurrence of localized prostate cancer. Moreover, Trop2 is significantly elevated in CRPC and NEPC, drives prostate cancer growth, and induces neuroendocrine phenotype. Overexpression of Trop2 induces tumor growth and metastasis while loss of Trop2 suppresses these abilities in vivo. Trop2-driven NEPC displays a significant up-regulation of PARP1, and PARP inhibitors significantly delay tumor growth and metastatic colonization and reverse neuroendocrine features in Trop2-driven NEPC.

Methods:   Australian population-based cohort of 2,164,172 cases, ages 15 to 89 years, whose first cancer diagnosis between 1982 and 2014 was one of 22 leading cancers, were followed up to December 2014. Flexible parametric cure models were used to estimate the proportion cured and median survival time for those uncured by age, sex, and spread of disease, and temporal trends in these measures.  Results:   Cure estimates could be generated for 19 of the 22 cancer types. The unadjusted proportion cured ranged from 5.0% for pancreatic cancer to 90.0% for melanoma. Median survival time for those uncured ranged from 0.35 years for pancreatic cancer to 6.05 years for prostate cancer. Cancers were divided into four groups according to their proportion cured in the 1980s and the degree of improvement over 28 years. Esophageal, stomach, pancreatic, liver, gallbladder, lung, and brain cancer had lower proportion cured and smaller improvements over time.  Conclusions:   For cancers with poor survival in which little has changed over time either in prolonging life or achieving statistical cure, efforts should be focused on reducing the prevalence of known risk factors and earlier detection, thereby enabling more effective treatment.

However, even with the advent of AR antagonist therapies, patients continue to develop resistance, and new strategies to combat continued AR signalling are needed. Here, we develop AR degraders using PROteolysis TArgeting Chimeric (PROTAC) technology in order to determine whether depletion of AR protein can overcome mechanisms of resistance commonly associated with current AR-targeting therapies. ARD-61 is the most potent of the AR degraders and effectively induces on-target AR degradation with a mechanism consistent with the PROTAC design. Compared to clinically-approved AR antagonists, administration of ARD-61 in vitro and in vivo results in more potent anti-proliferative, pro-apoptotic effects and attenuation of downstream AR target gene expression in prostate cancer cells. Importantly, we demonstrate that ARD-61 functions in enzalutamide-resistant model systems, characterized by diverse proposed mechanisms of resistance that include AR amplification/overexpression, AR mutation, and expression of AR splice variants, such as AR-V7. While AR degraders are unable to bind and degrade AR-V7, they continue to inhibit tumor cell growth in models overexpressing AR-V7. To further explore this, we developed several isogenic prostate cell line models in which AR-V7 is highly expressed, which also failed to influence the cell inhibitory effects of AR degraders, suggesting that AR-V7 is not a functional resistance mechanism for AR antagonism. These data provide compelling evidence that full-length AR remains a prominent oncogenic driver of prostate cancers which have developed resistance to AR antagonists and highlight the clinical potential of AR degraders for treatment of CRPC.""","""['Steven Kregel', 'Chao Wang', 'Xin Han', 'Lanbo Xiao', 'Ester Fernandez-Salas', 'Pushpinder Bawa', 'Brooke L McCollum', 'Kari Wilder-Romans', 'Ingrid J Apel', 'Xuhong Cao', 'Corey Speers', 'Shaomeng Wang', 'Arul M Chinnaiyan']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Neoplasia""","""['Niclosamide inhibits androgen receptor variants expression and overcomes enzalutamide resistance in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Combination therapy with androgen receptor N-terminal domain antagonist EPI-7170 and enzalutamide yields synergistic activity in AR-V7-positive prostate cancer.', 'Targeting the KIF4A/AR Axis to Reverse Endocrine Therapy Resistance in Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Androgen receptor targeting drugs in castration-resistant prostate cancer and mechanisms of resistance.', 'Enzalutamide: targeting the androgen signalling pathway in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.', ""Targeting Prostate Cancer, the 'Tousled Way'."", 'PROTACs: A novel strategy for cancer drug discovery and development.', 'New insights and options into the mechanisms and effects of combined targeted therapy and immunotherapy in prostate cancer.', 'PROTACs in the Management of Prostate Cancer.', 'α-Mangostin Promotes In Vitro and In Vivo Degradation of Androgen Receptor and AR-V7 Splice Variant in Prostate Cancer Cells.']"""

Resolving the delivered dose, which is currently unknown, is crucial to link radiotherapy doses to clinical outcomes and ultimately improve the standard of care.  Material and methods:   In this study, we present a dose reconstruction workflow based on data routinely acquired during MR-guided radiotherapy. It employs 3D MR images, 2D cine MR images and treatment machine log files to calculate the delivered dose taking intrafractional motion into account. The developed pipeline was used to measure anatomical changes and assess their dosimetric impact in 89 prostate radiotherapy fractions delivered with a 1.5 T MR-linac at our institute.  Results:   Over the course of radiation delivery, the CTV shifted 0.6 mm ± 2.1 mm posteriorly and 1.3 mm ± 1.5 mm inferiorly. When extrapolating the dose changes in each case to 20 fractions, the mean clinical target volume D98% and clinical target volume D50% dose-volume metrics decreased by 1.1 Gy ± 1.6 Gy and 0.1 Gy ± 0.2 Gy, respectively. Bladder D3% did not change (0.0 Gy ± 1.2 Gy), while rectum D3% decreased by 1.0 Gy ± 2.0 Gy.

It has been well studied in epithelial cells, cardiomyocytes and primary prostate cancer, colon cancer, skin squamous cell carcinoma, except for cervical cancer. Hence, we performed this study to examine the function of DSG2 in cervical cancer. We used TCGA and Oncomine databases to assess the expression level of DSG2 in cervical cancer cases. Kaplan-Meier method with log-rank test was utilized to plot overall survival (OS) curve. The reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and western blotting were performed to detect the expression of DSG2 in cells. Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8), wound-healing analysis, and transwell assay were carried out to examine proliferation, migration, and invasion of cells. A higher level of DSG2 in cervical cancer was associated with lower OS rate. Knockdown of DSG2 inhibited cervical cancer cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, while DSG2 enhancement promoted cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. Moreover, the proteins expression of p-MEK and p-ERK that are required for mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) pathway were downregulated after reducing DSG2. In conclusion, these findings illustrated the importance of DSG2 in cervical cancer development and cell behaviors by mediating MAPK signaling pathway, suggesting DSG2 maybe a novel therapeutic target in control of cervical cancer.""","""['Bing-Xia Zhou', 'Yan Li']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Kaohsiung J Med Sci""","""['Loss of desmoglein 2 promotes tumorigenic behavior in pancreatic cancer cells.', 'Desmoglein-2 is overexpressed in non-small cell lung cancer tissues and its knockdown suppresses NSCLC growth by regulation of p27 and CDK2.', 'Downregulation of desmoglein 2 promotes EMT progression in gallbladder cancer.', 'MicroRNA-497 accelerates apoptosis while inhibiting proliferation, migration, and invasion through negative regulation of the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway via RAF-1.', 'The lncRNA LINC00675 regulates cell proliferation, migration, and invasion by affecting Wnt/β-catenin signaling in cervical cancer.', 'Desmosomes as Signaling Hubs in the Regulation of Cell Behavior.', 'Understanding Cervical Cancer through Proteomics.', 'Paradoxical Roles of Desmosomal Components in Head and Neck Cancer.', 'Comparative Analysis of Cell-Cell Contact Abundance in Ovarian Carcinoma Cells Cultured in Two- and Three-Dimensional In Vitro Models.', 'Adenovirus Receptor Expression in Cancer and Its Multifaceted Role in Oncolytic Adenovirus Therapy.']"""

However, many studies are limited by relatively small samples, with virtually no data on the cancer experience of female firefighters. This study examines cancer risk in over 100,000 career Florida firefighters including 5000 + females assessed over a 34-year period.  Methods:   Florida firefighter employment records (n = 109 009) were linked with Florida Cancer Data System registry data (1981-2014; ~3.3 million records), identifying 3760 male and 168 female-linked primary cancers. Gender-specific age and calendar year-adjusted odds ratios (aOR) and 95% confidence intervals for firefighters vs non-firefighters were calculated.  Results:   Male firefighters were at increased risk of melanoma (aOR = 1.56; 1.39-1.76), prostate (1.36; 1.27-1.46), testicular (1.66; 1.34-2.06), thyroid (2.17; 1.78-2.66) and late-stage colon cancer (1.19;1.00-1.41). Female firefighters showed significantly elevated risk of brain (2.54; 1.19-5.42) and thyroid (2.42; 1.56-3.74) cancers and an elevated risk of melanoma that approached statistical significance (1.68; 0.97-2.90). Among male firefighters there was additional evidence of increased cancer risk younger than the age of 50 vs 50 years and older for thyroid (2.55; 1.96-3.31 vs 1.69; 1.22-2.34), prostate (1.88; 1.49-2.36 vs 1.36; 1.26-1.47), testicular (1.60; 1.28-2.01 vs 1.47; 0.73-2.94), and melanoma (1.87; 1.55-2.26 vs 1.42; 1.22-1.66) cancers.  Conclusion:   Male career firefighters in Florida are at increased risk for five cancers with typically stronger associations in those diagnosed younger than the age of 50, while there was evidence for increased thyroid and brain cancer, and possibly melanoma risk in female firefighters.

Case:   An 85-year-old male with advanced stage prostate cancer and multiple metastases was diagnosed with fecal impaction via digital rectal examination and evaluation of stool consistency. He was managed by regular digital evacuation of stool, but ultrasonic imaging indicated constipation with fecal retention in both the rectum and the colon despite this bowel evacuation program. When faced with this situation, we advocate a bowel management program that considers both intestinal elimination dysfunction and fecal transport dysfunction. Based on ultrasonic imaging, stool consistency was altered by promoting water intake, and we promoted self-defecation by asking the patient to attempt to move his bowels (regardless of cues to defecation) by sitting on the toilet every morning. As a result, the number of weekly enemas and digital dis-impaction episodes decreased while the number of spontaneous defecations increased.

Materials and methods:   A total of 598 patients in a prospectively maintained national database underwent focal high intensity focused ultrasound with a Sonablate® 500 device from March 2007 to November 2016. Followup consisted of 3-month clinic visits and prostate specific antigen testing in year 1 with prostate specific antigen measurement every 6 to 12 months and multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging with biopsy for magnetic resonance imaging suspicious for recurrence. Treatment failure was considered any secondary treatment, tumor recurrence with Gleason 3 + 4 or greater disease on prostate biopsy without further treatment or metastasis and/or prostate cancer related mortality. To diagnose failure we evaluated a series of nadir + x thresholds with x values of 0.1 to 2.0 ng/ml.  Results:   Median patient age was 65 years (IQR 60-71) and the median Gleason score was 7 (range 6-9). Gleason 3 + 4 or greater disease was present in 80% of cases. Tumors were radiologically staged as T1c-T2c in 522 of the 596 patients (88%) and as T3a/b in 74 (12.4%). Baseline median prostate specific antigen was 7.80 ng/ml (IQR 5.96-10.45) in failed cases and 6.77 ng/ml (IQR 2.65-9.71) in cases without failure. Optimal performance according to the Youden index to indicate the most appropriate nadir + x at all analyzed time points at 3-month intervals showed that nadir + 1.0 ng/ml would have 27.3% to 100% sensitivity and 39.4% to 85.6% specificity depending on the time of evaluation in the first 3 years. Nadir + 1.5 ng/ml showed 18.2% to 100% sensitivity and 60.6% to 91.8% specificity with nadir + 2.0 ng/ml leading to similar sensitivity and specificity ranges. Nadir + 1.0 ng/ml at 12 months and nadir + 1.5 ng/ml at 24 and 36 months had 100% sensitivity and 96.1% to 100% negative predictive value.  Conclusions:   Following focal high intensity focused ultrasound a prostate specific antigen nadir of 1.0 ng/ml at 12 months and 1.5 ng/ml at 24 to 36 months might be used to triage men requiring magnetic resonance imaging and biopsy.

Some of these phytoestrogens are androgen receptor (AR) antagonists and exhibit preventive role in the prostate cancer. However, in androgen-independent prostate cancer (AIPC) the ARs were mutated (T877A, W741L, F876L, etc.) and these mutant ARs convert the antagonist to agonist. Our aim in this study is to find phytoestrogens that could function as an antagonist with wild and mutant ARs. The phytoestrogens were analyzed for binding affinity with wild and mutant ARs in agonist and antagonist conformations. The point mutations were carried out using Chimera. The antagonist AR conformation was modeled using Modeller. We hypothesize that the compounds having binding affinity with agonist AR conformation could not function as a full or pure antagonist. Most of the phytoestrogens have binding affinity with agonist AR conformation contradicting previous results. For example, genistein which is a widely studied isoflavone has known AR antagonist property. However, in our study, it had good binding affinity with agonist AR conformation. Hence, to confirm our hypothesis, we tested genistein in LNCaP (T877A mutant AR) cells by qPCR studies. The genistein functioned as an antagonist only in the presence of an androgen indicting a partial agonist type of activity. The in-vitro results supported our docking hypothesis. We applied this principle and found syringaresinol could function as an antagonist with wild and mutated ARs. Further, we carried out molecular dynamics for the hit molecule to confirm its antagonist binding mode with mutant AR.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

Methods and materials:   CBCT images acquired for ten prostate cancer patients were processed by matching their histograms to those of deformed planning CT (pCT) images obtained after applying a deformable registration (DR) process. Then, HU values corresponding to five tissue types in the pCT were assigned to the obtained CBCT images (CBCTHM-MLT). Finally, the CBCTHM-MLT images were compared to the deformed pCT visually and using different statistical metrics.  Results:   The visual assessment and the profiles comparison showed that the high discrepancies in the CBCT images were significantly reduced when using the proposed approach. Furthermore, the correlation values indicated that the CBCTHM-MLT were in good agreement with the deformed pCT with correlation values ranging from 0.9893 to 0.9962. In addition, the root mean squared error (RMSE) over the entire volume was reduced from 64.15 ± 9.50 to 51.20 ± 6.76 HU. Similarly, the mean absolute error in specific tissue classes was significantly reduced especially in the soft tissue-air interfaces. These results confirmed that applying MLT after HM worked better than using only HM for which the correlation values were ranging from 0.9878 to 0.9955 and the RMSE was 55.95 ± 10.43 HU.

NLG207 (formerly CRLX101), a nanoparticle-drug conjugate (NDC) of CPT designed to optimize plasma pharmacokinetics and facilitate drug delivery to tumors, is included as part of combination treatment in two Phase II clinical trials ongoing at the National Cancer Institute (NCT02769962 and NCT03531827). To better understand the potential for drug-drug interactions and to correlate drug exposure to clinical outcomes and pharmacodynamic biomarkers, a robust analytical method was developed to measure CPT in human plasma. Two sample processing methods were developed to quantify both NDC-bound CPT and free CPT, primarily via alteration of pH conditions. A solid-phase extraction recovered >79 % of CPT prior to quantitative analysis by ultra HPLC-MS/MS. Dynamic calibration ranges of 10 to 10,000 ng/mL and 1 to 1000 ng/mL for total and free CPT, respectively were utilized to capture clinical ranges. NLG207 NDCs demonstrated significant rates of CPT release in human plasma at room temperature after 2 h but were shown to be stable at 4 °C for 24 h and through 4 freeze/thaw cycles. This assay was used to quantitate CPT plasma concentrations in clinical samples to confirm clinical utility following NLG207 treatment in subjects with advanced prostate cancer.""","""['Keith T Schmidt', 'Cody J Peer', 'Alwin D R Huitema', 'Monique D Williams', 'Susan Wroblewski', 'Jan H M Schellens', 'Ravi A Madan', 'William D Figg']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""J Pharm Biomed Anal""","""['A Single-arm Phase II Study Combining NLG207, a Nanoparticle Camptothecin, with Enzalutamide in Advanced Metastatic Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer Post-Enzalutamide.', 'Population pharmacokinetic analysis of nanoparticle-bound and free camptothecin after administration of NLG207 in adults with advanced solid tumors.', 'Antitumor Activity of NLG207 (Formerly CRLX101) in Combination with Enzalutamide in Preclinical Prostate Cancer Models.', '7-Ethyl-10-4-(1-piperidino)-1-piperidino carbonyloxy camptothecin: mechanism of resistance and clinical trials.', 'Clinical pharmacokinetics of irinotecan.', 'A Systematic Review of Clinical Trials on the Efficacy and Safety of CRLX101 Cyclodextrin-Based Nanomedicine for Cancer Treatment.', 'Nanoparticles advanced from preclinical studies to clinical trials for lung cancer therapy.', 'A Single-arm Phase II Study Combining NLG207, a Nanoparticle Camptothecin, with Enzalutamide in Advanced Metastatic Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer Post-Enzalutamide.', 'Controlled-Release Nanosystems with a Dual Function of Targeted Therapy and Radiotherapy in Colorectal Cancer.', 'Multifunctional biomolecule nanostructures for cancer therapy.']"""

PIM use was defined based on the 2015 Beers Criteria and was quantified using prescription claims. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to assess the associations between the patients' characteristics, clinical factors, and PIM use in patients with cancer based on Beers criteria. Propensity score matching was applied to compare use of PIM in patients with versus without cancer.  Results:   PIM usage rates in patients with colorectal and breast cancers were significantly higher than non-cancer-bearing adults; the difference in PIM usage rate was not significantly different in the prostate cancer-matched cohort. The prevalence of inappropriate medication use in the three types of cancers evaluated was directly correlated with number of medications prescribed, treatment with chemotherapy, and co-morbid medical problems.

The Elekta Clarity Autoscan system was used for intrafraction monitoring along the 3 directions: superior-inferior (SI), left-right (LR) and anterior-posterior (AP).  Results:   The intrafraction monitoring resulted in a mean prostate displacement of (-0.06 ± 0.49) mm, (-0.09 ± 0.61) mm and (-0.01 ± 0.78) mm in the SI, LR and AP directions, respectively. Even though large deviations up to 8 mm were detected, the frequency of occurrence was less than 0.1%. The prostate moved within ±2 mm in 99%, 98.1%, and 96.6% of the treatment time in the SI, LR and AP directions, respectively. During 100 s of monitoring, the median displacement increased from 0.2 mm to 0.8 mm and the maximum displacements increased from 5.2 mm to 7.8 mm. The majority of displacement values (99%) were within the clinical safety margins which ensures a good target coverage.  Conclusions:   The largest variation of intrafraction prostate displacement was observed along the AP direction. Throughout most of the treatment time, the prostate moved within a few millimeters. The extent of prostate displacement increased for longer monitoring times. During most of the tracking time, the prostate position was within the clinically safety margins.""","""['Anne Richter', 'Florian Exner', 'Stefan Weick', 'Ingulf Lawrenz', 'Bülent Polat', 'Michael Flentje', 'Frederick Mantel']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Z Med Phys""","""['Determination of Intrafraction Prostate Motion During External Beam Radiation Therapy With a\xa0Transperineal 4-Dimensional Ultrasound Real-Time Tracking System.', 'Intrafraction monitoring of prostate motion during radiotherapy using the Clarity® Autoscan Transperineal Ultrasound (TPUS) system.', 'Evaluation of intrafractional prostate displacement during prostate radiotherapy using real-time ultrasound system.', 'Duration-dependent margins for prostate radiotherapy-a\xa0practical motion mitigation strategy.', 'Determining intrafractional prostate motion using four dimensional ultrasound system.', 'Injection of hydrogel spacer increased maximal intrafractional prostate motion in anterior and superior directions during volumetric modulated arc therapy-stereotactic body radiation therapy for prostate cancer.']"""

Additionally, the high intra-observer and inter-observer variability in grading can result in overtreatment and undertreatment of prostate cancer. To alleviate these problems, we aimed to develop an artificial intelligence (AI) system with clinically acceptable accuracy for prostate cancer detection, localisation, and Gleason grading.  Methods:   We digitised 6682 slides from needle core biopsies from 976 randomly selected participants aged 50-69 in the Swedish prospective and population-based STHLM3 diagnostic study done between May 28, 2012, and Dec 30, 2014 (ISRCTN84445406), and another 271 from 93 men from outside the study. The resulting images were used to train deep neural networks for assessment of prostate biopsies. The networks were evaluated by predicting the presence, extent, and Gleason grade of malignant tissue for an independent test dataset comprising 1631 biopsies from 246 men from STHLM3 and an external validation dataset of 330 biopsies from 73 men. We also evaluated grading performance on 87 biopsies individually graded by 23 experienced urological pathologists from the International Society of Urological Pathology. We assessed discriminatory performance by receiver operating characteristics and tumour extent predictions by correlating predicted cancer length against measurements by the reporting pathologist. We quantified the concordance between grades assigned by the AI system and the expert urological pathologists using Cohen's kappa.  Findings:   The AI achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristics curve of 0·997 (95% CI 0·994-0·999) for distinguishing between benign (n=910) and malignant (n=721) biopsy cores on the independent test dataset and 0·986 (0·972-0·996) on the external validation dataset (benign n=108, malignant n=222). The correlation between cancer length predicted by the AI and assigned by the reporting pathologist was 0·96 (95% CI 0·95-0·97) for the independent test dataset and 0·87 (0·84-0·90) for the external validation dataset. For assigning Gleason grades, the AI achieved a mean pairwise kappa of 0·62, which was within the range of the corresponding values for the expert pathologists (0·60-0·73).  Interpretation:   An AI system can be trained to detect and grade cancer in prostate needle biopsy samples at a ranking comparable to that of international experts in prostate pathology. Clinical application could reduce pathology workload by reducing the assessment of benign biopsies and by automating the task of measuring cancer length in positive biopsy cores. An AI system with expert-level grading performance might contribute a second opinion, aid in standardising grading, and provide pathology expertise in parts of the world where it does not exist.

Specialised urological pathologists have greater concordance; however, such expertise is not widely available. Prostate cancer diagnostics could thus benefit from robust, reproducible Gleason grading. We aimed to investigate the potential of deep learning to perform automated Gleason grading of prostate biopsies.  Methods:   In this retrospective study, we developed a deep-learning system to grade prostate biopsies following the Gleason grading standard. The system was developed using randomly selected biopsies, sampled by the biopsy Gleason score, from patients at the Radboud University Medical Center (pathology report dated between Jan 1, 2012, and Dec 31, 2017). A semi-automatic labelling technique was used to circumvent the need for manual annotations by pathologists, using pathologists' reports as the reference standard during training. The system was developed to delineate individual glands, assign Gleason growth patterns, and determine the biopsy-level grade. For validation of the method, a consensus reference standard was set by three expert urological pathologists on an independent test set of 550 biopsies. Of these 550, 100 were used in an observer experiment, in which the system, 13 pathologists, and two pathologists in training were compared with respect to the reference standard. The system was also compared to an external test dataset of 886 cores, which contained 245 cores from a different centre that were independently graded by two pathologists.  Findings:   We collected 5759 biopsies from 1243 patients. The developed system achieved a high agreement with the reference standard (quadratic Cohen's kappa 0·918, 95% CI 0·891-0·941) and scored highly at clinical decision thresholds: benign versus malignant (area under the curve 0·990, 95% CI 0·982-0·996), grade group of 2 or more (0·978, 0·966-0·988), and grade group of 3 or more (0·974, 0·962-0·984). In an observer experiment, the deep-learning system scored higher (kappa 0·854) than the panel (median kappa 0·819), outperforming 10 of 15 pathologist observers. On the external test dataset, the system obtained a high agreement with the reference standard set independently by two pathologists (quadratic Cohen's kappa 0·723 and 0·707) and within inter-observer variability (kappa 0·71).  Interpretation:   Our automated deep-learning system achieved a performance similar to pathologists for Gleason grading and could potentially contribute to prostate cancer diagnosis. The system could potentially assist pathologists by screening biopsies, providing second opinions on grade group, and presenting quantitative measurements of volume percentages.

As an attempt to improve its pharmacokinetic properties, two PEGylated leuprolides with different molecular weight were synthesized utilizing N-hydroxysuccinimidyl (NHS) conjugation chemistry. The reaction conditions, including reaction temperature, reaction time and feed ratio of the reactants, were optimized to obtain a higher yield. Reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) characterization indicates a high purity of the resulting conjugates. Matrix-assisted laser desorption mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS) characterization suggests a 1:1 PEGylation. 1H NMR study reveals that the reaction occurs on the imidazolyl group on the histidine residue and the conjugates are stable in pH7.4 aqueous solutions. The in vitro bioactivity of the conjugates was evaluated using both hormone-sensitive and hormone-insensitive cell lines. It was found that the PEGylated peptides can still counteract the stimulatory action of androgens and the mitogenic action of epidermal growth factor on cell proliferation. The in vivo bioactivity of the conjugates was also tested. Like the unmodified peptide, administration of the conjugates to male rats leads to an initial testosterone surge, followed by a suppression of testosterone secretion. Pharmacokinetics of the drugs after i.v. and s.c. administrations were determined.

Recently, many studies have shown that high-level expression of PN is correlated significantly with tumor angiogenesis and prognosis in many kinds of human cancer. In previous experiments, we screened PN from prostate cancer through iTRAQ technology and found that PN affects occurrence and development of prostate cancer (PCa). However, whether and how periostin expression influences tumor angiogenesis in prostate cancer remains unknown. Our study aimed to examine expression of PN in patients with PCa and explored the relationship of PN expression with clinicopathologic factors and tumor angiogenesis. Immunohistochemistry was performed to determine expression of PN in PCa and benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH). Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and CD31 (used to mark tumor angiogenesis) were also examined in tissues from the PCa patients and hyperplasia patients mentioned above. The results showed that PN expression was significantly (P<0.001) higher in PCa (58%) than in BPH (18.8%) and VEGF expression was significantly (P=0.003) higher in PCa (55%) than in BPH (24.5%). Increased PN protein expression was associated with Gleason score (P=0.005) but there was no correlation with age (P=0.548), PSA (P=0.343) or clinic tumor staging (P=0.049). The results also showed that high expression of PN correlated with VEGF expression (P<0.001) and that tumors with PN-positive expression had significantly higher microvessel density (38.7±14.4 vs. 29.7±10.5; P=0.026) compared to those with PN-negative.

Materials and methods:   A retrospective study was accomplished on 315 patients with prostate cancer, eligible for active surveillance except prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level (PSA<30ng/dL), who underwent radical prostatectomy between 2005 and 2015. Patients were divided into two groups based on needle biopsy: A; with evidence of inflammation (chronic prostatitis) and B; without inflammation. The frequency of upstaging and upgrading in both groups was compared in different ranges of PSA level (<10, 10-20 and 20-30ng/dL). Upgrading/Upstaging was defined as increase from one prognostic grade group to another. Statistical analyses were performed to investigate the relation between inflammation and upgrading/upstaging.  Results:   The mean age of the patients was 68.2 years and the mean PSA level was 10.2 ng/mL. Chronic prostatitis was identified in 82 of 315 cases therefore upgrading/upstaging were seen in only three patients (3.7%) while 39 of 233 (16.7%) patients without inflammation had upgrading/upstaging in final pathology (P = 0.003). Other variables including the patient's PSA before surgery, PSA density, and the presence of hypoechoic areas in ultrasound had a significant relationship with the incidence of postoperative upgrading/upstaging. Among studied variables, presence of inflammation in biopsies was found to be the most important predictor of upstaging/upgrading (OR: 0.205).

Prospective comparative evidence is limited. In this study we compared the detection rate of clinically-significant prostate-cancer (csPCa) within an index lesion between TR and TP-fusion.  Patients and methods:   This was a prospective, noninferiority, and within-person trial. Men scheduled for MRI-US-fusion with a discrete MRI PI-RRAD ≥ 3 lesion were included. A dominant index lesion was determined for each subject and sampled by TR and TP-fusion during the same session. The order of biopsies was randomized and equipment was reset to avoid chronological and incorporation bias. For each subject, the index lesion was sampled 4-6 times in each approach. All biopsies were performed using Navigo fusion software (UC-Care, Yokneam, Israel). csPCa was defined as: Grade Group ≥ 2 or cancer-core length ≥ 6 mm. We used a noninferiority margin of 10% and a one-sided alpha level of 5%.  Results:   Seventy-seven patients completed the protocol. Median age was 68.2 years (IQR:64.2-72.2), median PSA was 8.9 ng/ml (IQR:6.18-12.2). Ten patients (13%) were biopsy naive, others (87%) had a previous biopsy. csPCa was detected in 32 patients (42%). All of these cases were detected by TP-fusion, while only 20 (26%) by TR-fusion. Absolute difference for csPCa diagnosis was 15.6 (CI 90% 27.9-3.2%) in favor of TP-fusion (p = 0.029). TP-fusion was noninferior to TR-fusion. The lower boundary of the 90% confidence-interval between TP-fusion and TR-fusion was greater than zero, therefore TP-fusion was also found to be superior. Exploratory subgroup analyses showed TP-fusion was consistently associated with higher detection rates of csPCa compared with TR-fusion in patient and index-lesion derived subgroups (size, location, PI-RADS, PSA, and biopsy history).  Conclusions:   In this study, TP-fusion biopsies were found to be noninferior and superior to TR-fusion biopsies in detecting csPCa within MRI-visible index lesion.

The oncogenic MUC1-C protein is overexpressed in castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) and NEPC, but its specific role is unknown. Here, we demonstrate that upregulation of MUC1-C in androgen-dependent PC cells suppresses androgen receptor (AR) axis signaling and induces the neural BRN2 transcription factor. MUC1-C activates a MYC→BRN2 pathway in association with induction of MYCN, EZH2 and NE differentiation markers (ASCL1, AURKA and SYP) linked to NEPC progression. Moreover, MUC1-C suppresses the p53 pathway, induces the Yamanaka pluripotency factors (OCT4, SOX2, KLF4 and MYC) and drives stemness. Targeting MUC1-C decreases PC self-renewal capacity and tumorigenicity, suggesting a potential therapeutic approach for CRPC and NEPC.

The Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) uses multiparametric MRI (mpMRI) to assign a score indicating the likelihood of clinically significant prostate cancer. We evaluated pretreatment mpMRI findings, including PI-RADS score, as a marker for outcome in patients treated with primary radiation therapy (RT).  Methods:   One hundred and twenty-three men, 64% and 36% of whom had National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) intermediate-risk and high-risk disease, respectively, underwent mpMRI prior to RT. PI-RADS score and size of the largest nodule were analyzed with respect to freedom from biochemical failure (FFBF) and freedom from distant metastasis.  Results:   A PI-RADS score of ≤3, 4, or 5 was defined in 7%, 49%, and 44%; with a median nodule size of 0, 8, and 18 mm, respectively (P < 0.001). Median follow-up was 67 months.

Methods:   We retrospectively analyzed clinical data from 186 patients who underwent docetaxel chemotherapy for CRPC from 2005 to 2016 at a single center. Pretreatment baseline variables including demographic and clinicopathological data were reviewed. Disease progression was defined by imaging and/or consecutive prostate-specific antigen (PSA) elevation. The systemic immune-inflammation index (SII), the modified Glasgow Prognostic Score (mGPS), and the neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) were calculated. Univariable and multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression analyses reporting hazard ratios assessed the risk for disease progression and overall survival (OS). A survival nomogram was constructed.  Results:   Most patients (n = 139, 74.7%) completed at least 6 cycles of docetaxel chemotherapy. 156 patients (82.9%) experienced disease progression during the studied period. Only mGPS was independently associated with disease progression in a multivariable model (P < 0.01). During the studied period, 98 patients (52.1%) died. The built survival nomogram included statistically significant variables for OS in univariable analysis: hemoglobin, PSA, alkaline phosphatase (AP), lactate dehydrogenase, SII, neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio, mGPS, and site of metastases; and had a concordance index of 0.703. At decision curve analysis, the nomogram led to superior outcomes for any decision associated with a threshold probability of above 40%. In multivariable analysis, only AP (P = 0.02), hemoglobin and PSA (P < 0.01, respectively) remained associated with OS.  Conclusions:   PSA, AP, and hemoglobin are independent prognosticators for OS. Although mGPS is a promising marker for tumor progression and SII is a plausible prognostic marker for OS, valid integration of inflammatory indices into a prognostic model requires validation studies.

Current recommendation in our region is for an opportunistic approach to screening, with estimated low prevalence of such practice in the community. However, our clinical observations suggested that the extent is beyond what might be expected from an opportunistic screening practice. This study aims to estimate the current prevalence and the extent of opportunistic CaP screening, and investigate the contemporary patterns of PSA testing in a large population.  Methods:   From 2008 to 2017, all men in the Northern cancer network of New Zealand, who had a screening PSA test performed in a community laboratory were identified. The study variables were accessed from multiple prospectively maintained databases. These included: Age, Ethnicity, Region, Social deprivation, Medical therapy, CaP history, Gleason score, and PSA test information (results and date). Population estimations were obtained from customized an updated national census data.  Results:   The study cohort constituted 311,725 men, with 1,208,214 PSA tests performed, in the ten-year period. The mean age at first test was 55.2 years and each man received approximately 4 PSA tests. The prevalence of opportunistic CaP PSA screening in men aged 40 to 79 years, was 87% of the region population. In the 50 to 69-year age group, 65% of men in the region had been receiving regular 2-yearly, screening PSA tests. Men who had 3 or more PSA tests, were more likely to be diagnosed with CaP (Odds ratio [OR] 1.85, P < 0.001).

However, its further development as a viable drug candidate is hindered by its limited availability. More importantly, conversion of its chemically fragile side chain into a stabilized bioisostere is envisioned to enable zampanolide to possess more drug-like properties. As part of our ongoing project aiming to develop its mimics with a stable side chain using straightforward synthetic approaches, 2-fluorobenzyl alcohol was designed as a bioisosteric surrogate for the side chain based on its binding conformation as confirmed by the X-ray structure of tubulin complexed with zampanolide. Two new zampanolide mimics with the newly designed side chain have been successfully synthesized through a 25-step chemical transformation for each. Yamaguchi esterification and intramolecular Horner-Wadsworth-Emmons condensation were used as key reactions to construct the lactone core. The chiral centers at C17 and C18 were introduced by the Sharpless asymmetric dihydroxylation. Our WST-1 cell proliferation assay data in both docetaxel-resistant and docetaxel-naive prostate cancer cell lines revealed that compound 6 is the optimal mimic and the newly designed side chain can serve as a bioisostere for the chemically fragile N-acetyl hemiaminal side chain in zampanolide.""","""['Guanglin Chen', 'Ziran Jiang', 'Qiang Zhang', 'Guangdi Wang', 'Qiao-Hong Chen']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Molecules""","""['An amide mimic of desTHPdactylolide: Total synthesis and antiproliferative evaluation.', 'Synthesis and antiproliferative evaluation of new zampanolide mimics.', 'Optimized synthesis and antiproliferative activity of desTHPdactylolides.', 'Zampanolide and dactylolide: cytotoxic tubulin-assembly agents and promising anticancer leads.', 'Recent advances in microtubule-stabilizing agents.', 'Sharpless Asymmetric Dihydroxylation: An Impressive Gadget for the Synthesis of Natural Products: A Review.', 'In Vivo Evaluation of (-)-Zampanolide Demonstrates Potent and Persistent Antitumor Efficacy When Targeted to the Tumor Site.', 'An amide mimic of desTHPdactylolide: Total synthesis and antiproliferative evaluation.', 'Synthesis and Biological Evaluations of Electrophilic Steroids Inspired by the Taccalonolides.']"""

Usually, after a short period of time chemotherapy resistance emerges and there is urgent need to find new therapeutic targets to overcome therapy resistance. The lysine-acetyltransferase p300 has been correlated to prostate cancer (PCa) progression. Here, we aimed to clarify a possible function of p300 in chemotherapy resistance and verify p300 as a target in chemoresistant PCa. Immunohistochemistry staining of tissue samples revealed significantly higher p300 protein expression in patients who received docetaxel as a neoadjuvant therapy compared to control patients. Elevated p300 expression was confirmed by analysis of publicly available patient data, where significantly higher p300 mRNA expression was found in tissue of mCRPC tumors of docetaxel-treated patients. Consistently, docetaxel-resistant PCa cells showed increased p300 protein expression compared to docetaxel-sensitive counterparts. Docetaxel treatment of PCa cells for 72 h resulted in elevated p300 expression. shRNA-mediated p300 knockdown did not alter colony formation efficiency in docetaxel-sensitive cells, but significantly reduced clonogenic potential of docetaxel-resistant cells. Downregulation of p300 in docetaxel-resistant cells also impaired cell migration and invasion.

The survival of a second artificial urinary sphincter in the setting of prior device complication and radiation is not well described. We report the survival of redo artificial urinary sphincter surgery and identify risk factors for repeat complications.  Materials and methods:   A multi-institutional database was queried for redo artificial urinary sphincter surgeries. The primary outcome was median survival of a second and third artificial urinary sphincter in radiated and nonradiated cases. A Cox proportional hazards survival analysis was performed to identify additional patient and surgery risk factors.  Results:   Median time to explantation of the initial artificial urinary sphincter in radiated (150) and nonradiated (174) cases was 26.4 and 35.6 months, respectively (p=0.043). For a second device median time to explantation was 30.1 and 38.7 months (p=0.034) and for a third device it was 28.5 and 30.6 months (p=0.020), respectively. The 5-year revision-free survival for patients undergoing a second artificial urinary sphincter surgery with no risk factors, history of radiation, history of urethroplasty, and history of radiation and urethroplasty were 83.1%, 72.6%, 63.9% and 46%, respectively.  Conclusions:   Patients without additional risk factors undergoing second and third artificial urinary sphincter surgeries experience revision-free rates similar to those of their initial artificial urinary sphincter devices. Patients who have been treated with pelvic radiation have earlier artificial urinary sphincter complications.

Material and methods:   87 patients with suspected Prostatic Cancer on prostate MRI underwent fusion transperineal prostate biopsy in our Department. 37 patients had at least one prior negative classic prostatic transrectal biopsy. Clinically significant tumor was described as Gleason 7(3+4) or higher. The Chi-square test was used to analyze the relationship between prostate cancer and the different PIRADS stages, as well as logistic regression and linear trend tests, comparing the proportions using measures of association intensity. We use the HITACHI Real-Time Virtual Sonography (HI-RVS) system, and the STATA/IC v.14.2 software for statistical analysis.  Results:   64.37% patients had tested positive for malignancy. Median age 67.89 years old.

Methods:   MRI images of 56 patients with pathological proven prostate cancer were analyzed retrospectively, including 31 patients with pure prostate adenocarcinoma and 25 patients with IDCP component in the prostate adenocarcinoma lesions. After imaging features of lesions were analyzed, then enhanced arterial and venous phase images were imported into Omni-Kinetics software for the extraction the TA features of region of interests' lesion according to the T2-weighted imaging. In order to set up a regression prediction model which based on texture parameters and morphological features. Furthermore, the comparison of diagnostic accuracy of each TA regression models were assessed by operating characteristic curves (ROC).  Results:   Among the imaging features of peripheral lesions, the incidence of surgical capsule invasion, prostatic capsule involvement, and seminal vesicle invasion in patients with IDCP was higher than that in patients with adenocarcinoma alone ( P<0.05). Among the imaging features of transitional zone lesions, patients with adenocarcinoma containing IDCP had a higher incience of imaging features as benign prostatic hyperplasia, extracapsular invasion of the prostate, seminal vesicles invasion, and vascular nerve bundles than that in pure adenocarcinoma group ( P<0.05). In order to differential diagnosis of simple adenocarcinoma and adenocarcinoma containing IDCP, 4 arterial phase texture features were used to build the regression model in the peripheral zone group, and the area under the curve ( AUC) of the TA model and combined model with or without seminal vesicles invasion were 0.890 and 0.938, respectively. In the transitional zone group, 2 arterial phase texture features and 2 venous phase features were used in TA regression model, and the AUC of texture model and the combined model with or without vascular nerve bundles were 0.844 and 0.901, respectively.  Conclusion:   The incidence of adenocarcinoma with IDCP is higher in high-grade invasive prostate cancer.

Inter-institutional studies highlighted that plan quality strongly depends on planner experience and skills. Automated optimization of planning procedure may improve plan quality and best practice. We performed a comprehensive dosimetric and clinical evaluation of the Pinnacle3 AutoPlanning engine, comparing automatically generated plans (AP) with the historically clinically accepted manually-generated ones (MP). Thirty-six patients (12 for each of the following anatomical sites: head-neck, high-risk prostate and endometrial cancer) were re-planned with the AutoPlanning engine. Planning and optimization workflow was developed to automatically generate ""dual-arc"" VMAT plans with simultaneously integrated boost. Various dose and dose-volume parameters were used to build three metrics able to supply a global Plan Quality Index evaluation in terms of dose conformity indexes, targets coverage and sparing of critical organs. All plans were scored in a blinded clinical evaluation by two senior radiation oncologists. Dose accuracy was validated using the PTW Octavius-4D phantom together with the 1500 2D-array. Autoplanning was able to produce high-quality clinically acceptable plans in all cases. The main benefit of Autoplanning strategy was the improvement of overall treatment quality due to significant increased dose conformity and reduction of integral dose by 6-10%, keeping similar targets coverage. Overall planning time was reduced to 60-80 minutes, about a third of time needed for manual planning. In 94% of clinical evaluations, the AP plans scored equal or better to MP plans. Despite the increased fluence modulation, dose measurements reported an optimal agreement with dose calculations with a γ-pass-rate greater than 95% for 3%(global)-2 mm criteria.

However, there remain several open challenges in designing adaptive therapies, particularly in extending these therapeutic concepts to multiple treatments. We present a cancer treatment case study (metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer) as a point of departure to illustrate three novel concepts to aid the design of multidrug adaptive therapies. First, frequency-dependent ""cycles"" of tumor evolution can trap tumor evolution in a periodic, controllable loop. Second, the availability and selection of treatments may limit the evolutionary ""absorbing region"" reachable by the tumor.

We aimed to assess the added value of multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) and targeted biopsy (TB) features for predicting final pathology and for improving the well-established favourable/unfavourable systematic biopsy-based sub-classification.  Materials and methods:   From a prospective database of 377 intermediate risk CaP cases, we evaluated the performance of the standard intermediate risk classification (IRC), and the predictive factors for unfavourable disease on final pathology aiming to build a new model. Overall unfavourable disease (OUD) was defined by any pT3-4 and/or pN1 and/or grade group (GG) ≥ 3.  Results:   The standard IRC was found to be predictive for unfavourable disease in this population. However, in multivariable analysis regression, ECE on mpMRI and GG ≥3 on TB remained the 2 independent predictive factors for OUD disease (HR = 2.7, P = 0.032, and HR = 2.41, P = 0.01, respectively). By using the new IRC in which unfavorable risk was defined by ECE on mpMRI and/or GG ≥3 on TB, the proportion of unfavorable cases decreased from 62.3% to 34.1% while better predicting unfavorable disease in RP speciments. The new model displayed a better accuracy than the standard IRC for predicting OUD (AUC: 0.66 vs. 0.55).

Objective:   To compare the frequency of germline pathogenic mutations in commonly assayed PCa genes between high- and low-grade PCa in patients initially presenting with clinically localized disease.  Design, setting, and participants:   A retrospective case-case study of 1694 PCa patients who underwent radical prostatectomy at Johns Hopkins Hospital, including 706 patients with high-grade (grade group [GG] 4 and GG5) and 988 patients with low-grade (GG1) disease.

Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Carrier rates of pathogenic mutations were compared between high- and low-grade PCa patients using the Fisher's exact test.  Results and limitations:   Overall, the carrier rate of germline pathogenic mutations in the 13 genes was significantly higher in high-grade patients (8.64%) than in low-grade patients (3.54%, p = 9.98 × 10-6).

The mutation carrier rate was significantly higher in patients with GG5 than in patients with GG1 disease for the 13 genes overall (13.07% and 3.54%, respectively, p = 1.27 × 10-9); for the three genes ATM, BRCA2, and MSH2 (7.73% and 0.40%, respectively, p = 3.20 × 10-13); and for the remaining nine DNA repair genes (5.07% and 2.43%, respectively, p = 0.02).  Conclusions:   In men undergoing treatment for clinically localized disease, pathogenic mutations in 13 commonly assayed genes, especially ATM, BRCA2, and MSH2, are most strongly associated with GG5 PCa. These findings emphasize the importance of genetic testing in men with high-grade PCa, particularly GG5 disease, to inform both treatment decisions and familial risk assessment.

During neuroendocrine transdifferentiation (NETD), PCa cells are able to differentiate into androgen-independent neuroendocrine-like (NE-like) tumor cells, which are associated with reduced survival rates in PCa patients. The molecular processes underlying NETD have not been clarified yet, but miRNAs could play a potential role. MiRNAs are short, single-stranded, non-coding RNA molecules that regulate gene expression post-transcriptionally by binding to the 3'-untranslated region (3'UTR) of their target mRNAs. This study aimed to explore the possible relevance and function of the transmembrane Hyaluronan Synthase 3 (HAS3) and miR-10b as well as miR-29a during NETD. Here, we validated a repression of HAS3 and an induction of miR-10b and miR-29a by quantitative real-time PCR after NETD. HAS3 was predicted as a new target gene for both miRNAs, which was verified by Reporter Gene Assays and Western Blotting. Functional analyses revealed an inhibiting effect of HAS3 on cell proliferation and migration in LNCaP cells, whereas miR-10b showed no impact. Furthermore, HAS3 increased the colony forming ability, while miR-10b diminished it. These results might give a hint on the role of miR-10b and HAS3 during NETD of PCa cells.""","""['Elena D Czyrnik', 'Marc Wiesehöfer', 'Jaroslaw T Dankert', 'Gunther Wennemuth']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Biochem Biophys Res Commun""","""['The deregulation of miR-17/CCND1 axis during neuroendocrine transdifferentiation of LNCaP prostate cancer cells.', 'Tumor necrosis factor receptor associated factor-4: an adapter protein overexpressed in metastatic prostate cancer is regulated by microRNA-29a.', 'Systematic analysis of microRNAs targeting the androgen receptor in prostate cancer cells.', 'MicroRNAs and prostate cancer.', 'Neuroendocrine-like prostate cancer cells: neuroendocrine transdifferentiation of prostate adenocarcinoma cells.', 'The Oral Tumor Cell Exosome miR-10b Stimulates Cell Invasion and Relocation via AKT Signaling.', 'A novel 8-gene panel for prediction of early biochemical recurrence in patients with prostate cancer after radical prostatectomy.', 'Role of MicroRNAs in Neuroendocrine Prostate Cancer.', 'MicroRNAs in treatment-induced neuroendocrine differentiation in prostate cancer.', 'Loss of RBMS1 as a regulatory target of miR-106b influences cell growth, gap closing and colony forming in prostate carcinoma.']"""

Methods:   Data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program ""Prostate with Watchful Waiting Database,"" where conservative treatment was delineated by a distinct classifier, was used to evaluate factors associated with electing for conservative management at initial diagnosis (2010-2015). Men aged ≥40 years with cT1-T2a and T2NOS with Gleason score 3 + 3 and 3 + 4 were included (n = 118,415). Multivariable logistic regression was used to determine the association between clinical and sociodemographic factors and electing conservative management.  Results:   Between 2010 and 15, a total of 22,099 (18.6%) men were managed conservatively. Mean age of men managed conservatively decreased from 66.6 to 64.6 years, and median prostate-specific antigen (PSA) increased from 5.7 to 6.0 ng/mL, P <.0001. Men with lower income experienced a greater increase in conservative management rates compared to those with high income (152% vs 72% for third and fifth [richest] income quintiles, respectively). On multivariable analysis, Gleason score 3 + 3, older age, lower PSA, more recent year, treatment in the West, and higher levels of county income were significantly associated with conservative management.  Conclusion:   Characteristics of men undergoing conservative management are rapidly changing. Younger men, men with higher PSAs, and men of all incomes are increasingly being managed conservatively.

Survivin knockout could inhibit epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and suppress several metastatic tumors. In this study, we examined the potential involvement of survivin in EMT in CTCs.  Methods:   CTCs were isolated from the peripheral blood of 100 patients with prostate cancer as EpCAM+/CD45− cells via FACS sorting and identified by immunofluorescence staining of prostate-specific antigen (PSA). CTCs and DU145 cells were transfected with survivin siRNA. Then, the levels of survivin, E-cadherin, and vimentin in CTCs and DU145 cells were detected via immunofluorescence staining, and the invasiveness of CTCs and DU145 cells was examined using a Transwell chamber.  Results:   The results revealed the abundant expression of PSA in the cytoplasm of CTCs. Transfection of survivin siRNA significantly decreased the levels of survivin and vimentin in CTCs and DU145, whereas that of E-cadherin was significantly increased, suggesting survivin plays an important role in EMT of CTCs. In addition, survivin siRNA significantly inhibited the invasiveness of CTCs and DU145 cells.

A Markov decision-analytic trial-based model was developed, projecting the results over a 5-year time horizon with one-month cycles. Clinical data were derived from the STOMP trial and literature. Treatment costs were derived from official government documents. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses showed that MDT is cost-effective compared to surveillance (ICER: €8393/quality adjusted life year (QALY)) and immediate ADT (dominant strategy). The ICER is most sensitive to utilities in the different health states and the first month MDT cost. At a willingness-to-pay threshold of €40,000 per QALY, the cost of the first month MDT should not exceed €8136 to be cost-effective compared to surveillance.

We measured ARFL and ARV7 mRNA in PBMC and CTC from patients prior to receiving abiraterone (AA), enzalutamide (E), or taxanes by a pre-amplification plus quantitative reverse-transcription PCR.

High PBMC ARV7 levels correlated with worse AA/E and better taxane response. In taxane-treated patients high PBMC ARFL also correlated with longer progression-free survival (PFS). High ARV7 and ARFL expression were independently associated with better biochemical-PFS. Conversely, high CTC ARV7 and ARFL correlated with shorter radiological-PFS and overall survival, respectively. High ARV7 in 22RV1DR and LNCaP-ARV7 cells correlated with taxane resistance.

CYP1B1 inhibition is the current predominant therapeutic paradigm to treating CYP1B1-mediated malignancy, but therapeutic effect has little success. Herein, we reported CYP1B1 degradation in place of CYP1B1 inhibition for reversing drug resistance toward docetaxel in CYP1B1-overexpressing prostate cancer cell line DU145 using a PROTAC strategy. Replacing chlorine atom of a CYP1B1 selective inhibitor we found previously with ethynyl, we got the resulting α-naphthoflavone derivative 5 which kept strong inhibition against CYP1B1 (IC50 = 0.4 ± 0.2 nM) and high selectivity. Coupling of 5 with thalidomide derivatives of varying chain lengths afforded conjugates 6A-Dvia click reaction. In vitro cell-based assay indicated that 6C was more effective in eliminating drug resistance of CYP1B1-overexpressed DU145 cells compared with other analogues. Western blotting analysis showed CYP1B1 degradation was one main reason for the reversal of drug resistance to docetaxel and the effect was obtained in a concentration-dependent manner.

Methods:   Using Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-Medicare, we identified men diagnosed with localized prostate cancer between 2007 and 2011. We created physician-hospital networks by assigning each patient to a physician and each physician to a hospital based on treatment patterns. We assessed content validity by examining characteristics of hospitals anchoring the physician-hospital networks and of the patients associated with these hospitals.  Results:   We identified 42,963 patients associated with 344 physician-hospital networks. Networks anchored by a teaching hospital (compared to a nonteaching hospital) had higher median numbers of prostate cancer patients (117 [interquartile range {71-189} vs 82 {50-126}]) and treating physicians (7 [4-11] vs 4 [3-6]) (both P <0.001). On average, patients traveled farther to networks anchored by a teaching hospital (49 miles [standard deviation] [207] vs 41 [183]; P <.001). Hospitals known as high-volume centers for robotic prostatectomies, proton-beam therapy, and active surveillance had network rates for these procedures well above the mean. Hospitals known as safety net providers served higher proportions of minorities.

This study aims to determine if pre-treatment Hb is associated with late toxicity or survival outcomes in prostate cancer.  Methods:   Data from one Phase III randomised controlled trial and one single arm translational trial were analysed. Patients had localized prostate cancer and received ≥70 Gy radiotherapy and neo-adjuvant androgen deprivation between 1997 and 2013.  Results:   302 males were included. Median follow-up was 6.8 years for toxicity and 10.3 years for survival outcomes. Patients with Hb below the reference range were more likely to experience Grade 2-3 late gastrointestinal toxicity than patients with Hb within the range (p = 0.050). Neither late genitourinary toxicity, erectile function toxicity, prostate-specific antigen relapse free survival nor overall survival of patients were statistically significantly different between groups.  Conclusion:   Anaemia in prostate cancer is found in the minority of patients and is usually mild. Prostate cancer patients undergoing radiotherapy with low Hb were more likely to experience Grade 2-3 late gastrointestinal toxicity.  Advances in knowledge:   This study is one of the first in the published literature to investigate the role of Hb in prostate cancer toxicity and survival.

The reliability of the ZnCl3- detection was validated by total zinc determination using laser ablation inductively coupled plasma MSI on adjacent serial tissue sections. Zinc, citrate, and aspartate were correlated with each other (range r = 0.46 to 0.74) and showed a significant reduction in cancer compared to non-cancer epithelium (p < 0.05, log2 fold change range: -0.423 to -0.987), while no significant difference between cancer and stroma tissue was found.

Objective:   To investigate the value of the CMS price transparency rule in allowing patients with prostate cancer to comparison shop by price for radiation treatment services among National Cancer Institute-designated cancer centers.  Design, setting, and participants:   We identified the February 2019 publicly available price-containing chargemasters for National Cancer Institute-designated cancer centers. We isolated the charge per fraction of intensity-modulated radiation therapy used in standard prostate radiation treatment. We then calculated the mean (SD) charges of a 28-fraction course of prostate irradiation at all included hospitals. No human participants were included in this study.  Main outcomes and measures:   We analyzed the degree of price variation, the association of the mean price to the price paid by Medicare, and the association of the prices with the practice expense geographic practice cost index, as determined by Medicare.  Results:   Of the 63 designated hospitals, 52 (84%) listed a price for simple intensity-modulated radiation therapy that is associated with standard prostate cancer radiation treatment. For a standard 28-fraction treatment, the charges ranged from $18 368 to $399 056, with a mean of $111 728.80 (10.1 times the price paid by Medicare). There was a weak positive association between price and geographic practice cost index, with an r2 value of 0.13 (P = .008).  Conclusions and relevance:   The availability of CMS-mandated hospital chargemasters and the descriptors used for simple intensity-modulated radiation therapy are not uniform, and the listed charges are highly variable. The association between listed charges and actual prices paid by patients or insurers is unclear, mitigating the value of the CMS rule for patients with prostate cancer who are receiving radiation therapy.

Therefore, it is often interesting to evaluate how well a biomarker can predict the response to a treatment. To do so, a popular methodology consists of using a regression model and testing for an interaction between treatment assignment and biomarker. However, the existence of an interaction is not sufficient for a biomarker to be predictive. It is only necessary. Hence, the use of the marker-by-treatment predictiveness curve has been recommended. In addition to evaluate how well a single continuous biomarker predicts treatment response, it can further help to define an optimal threshold. This curve displays the risk of a binary outcome as a function of the quantiles of the biomarker, for each treatment group. Methods that assume a binary outcome or rely on a proportional hazard model for a time-to-event outcome have been proposed to estimate this curve. In this work, we propose some extensions for censored data. They rely on a time-dependent logistic model, and we propose to estimate this model via inverse probability of censoring weighting. We present simulations results and three applications to prostate cancer, liver cirrhosis, and lung cancer data. They suggest that a large number of events need to be observed to define a threshold with sufficient accuracy for clinical usefulness. They also illustrate that when the treatment effect varies with the time horizon which defines the outcome, then the optimal threshold also depends on this time horizon.""","""['Bassirou Mboup', 'Paul Blanche', 'Aurélien Latouche']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Pharm Stat""","""['Correlation-adjusted regression survival scores for high-dimensional variable selection.', 'Analysis of accelerated failure time data with dependent censoring using auxiliary variables via nonparametric multiple imputation.', 'A visualization method measuring the performance of biomarkers for guiding treatment decisions.', 'Correcting for dependent censoring in routine outcome monitoring data by applying the inverse probability censoring weighted estimator.', 'Quantifying Treatment Benefit in Molecular Subgroups to Assess a Predictive Biomarker.']"""

Thus, the key events associated with PCa metastasis are under rigorous investigation, with recent studies showing that preparation of pre-metastatic niches (PMN) in distant organs is an important step. However, the molecular basis for PMN preparation is still unclear. Hypoxia in primary tumors promotes aggressiveness; however, its precise role in metastasis is not clear. We recently reported that exosomes secreted by PCa cells under hypoxia promote stemness and invasiveness in naïve PCa cells; however, whether these extracellular vesicles also influence PMN remains unknown. In the present study, we isolated exosomes from human PCa PC3 cells under normoxic (21% O2 , exosomes secreted under normoxic condition [ExoNormoxic ]) and hypoxic (1% O2 , exosomes secreted under hypoxic condition [ExoHypoxic ]) conditions, and characterized their effect (10 µg exosomes, intraperitoneal (IP) treatment every 48 hours for 4 weeks) on key biomarkers associated with PMN in nude mice. Whole animal fluorescence imaging showed that ExoHypoxic treatment promotes matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) activity in several putative metastatic sites. Histological studies confirmed that ExoHypoxic treatment enhanced the level of MMP2, MMP9, and extracellular matrix proteins (fibronectin and collagen) as well as increased the number of CD11b+ cells at selective PMN sites. Furthermore, proteomic profiling of exosomes by liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry identified cargo proteins in ExoNormoxic and ExoHypoxic as well as distinct canonical pathways targeted by them.

However, the safety and efficacy profiles across different ethnicities for long-term TRT remain unclear.  Objective:   To measure the impact of ethnicity on various biochemical parameters following testosterone undecanoate (TU) replacement.  Method:   A retrospective analysis of 50 male patients treated with TU from 2006 to 2017 in a large secondary care centre was performed. Changes in total testosterone, PSA, haematocrit, haemoglobin, total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) over eight years of treatment were analysed. Wilcoxon rank sum test was used to assess differences in these parameters between Caucasians and South Asians.  Results:   Thirty-one Caucasians (age: median (IQR) 55.0 years (49.0-68.0); total duration of follow-up 6.1 years (2.9-9.3)) and 19 South Asians (age: median (IQR) 52.0 years (38.0-69.0); duration of follow-up 6.5 years (1.3-8.4)) were treated with TU during the study period. There was no significant difference in total testosterone levels between the two ethnicities. We noted a higher free and bioavailable testosterone in South Asians than Caucasians, albeit within their reference range. PSA was higher in Caucasians than South Asians at two and eight years of TU therapy. After one year of TRT, haematocrit was higher in South Asians than Caucasians at one year, whereas LDL and total cholesterol were significantly higher in Caucasians than South Asians.  Conclusions:   Caucasians have a tendency towards increased PSA, total cholesterol and LDL compared with South Asians with TU replacement therapy. There is a higher increment of haematocrit in South Asians following one year of TU replacement therapy. All biochemical changes following TRT were within the respective reference ranges suggesting no apparent risk of prostate cancer and venous thromboembolism.""","""['Punith Kempegowda', 'Lauren M Quinn', 'Joht Singh Chandan', 'Lisa Shepherd', 'Samina Kauser', 'Asad Rahim', 'Andrew Bates']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Clin Endocrinol (Oxf)""","""['Re: Long-Term Testosterone Undecanoate Replacement Therapy: Impact of Ethnicity.', 'Two-Year Analysis of a New Oral Testosterone Undecanoate (TU) Formulation in Hypogonadal Men: Efficacy, Impact on Psychosexual Function, and Safety.', 'Retrospective investigation of testosterone undecanoate depot for the long-term treatment of male hypogonadism in clinical practice.', 'Is testosterone replacement therapy in males with hypogonadism cost-effective?

The CHAARTED and STAMPEDE studies have proven that early chemotherapy in the hormone-sensitive setting yields a greater net survival advantage than docetaxel for mCRPC. In a retrospective study, we attempt to investigate the two most common treatment sequences for mCRPC and investigate whether earlier chemotherapy for mCRPC is consequential to survival outcomes.  Methods:   We identified 112 patients with mCRPC treated at the Mayo Clinic between 2011 and 2017. We identified two cohorts, 80 patients (group A) received full course docetaxel chemotherapy followed by second generation hormone therapy (2nd gen androgen deprivation therapy [ADT]; Abiraterone or Enzalutamide) and 32 patients (group B) treated with 2nd gen ADT followed by docetaxel. The primary endpoint evaluated was 3-year cancer-specific survival.  Results:   Mean prostate specific antigen at initiation of first treatment was 32.0 in group A and 21.7 in group B (P = .4). Bone metastases were more prevalent in group B (87% vs 58%, P = .01). All other clinicopathologic variables were statistically similar between group A and group B. Three-year cancer-specific survival was 87.4% vs 64.1% for group A and group B, respectively (P = .016). We report a univariate hazard ratio of 3.61 (95% CI, 1.74-9.5, 0 P = .01). Three-year overall survival was 82.4% and 60.8% for group A and group B, P = .01. These results held true when excluding patients with lymph node only metastasi.  Conclusion:   Our data indicates that sequence of systemic therapy may influence outcomes for mCRPC and that docetaxel should be considered before 2nd generation ADT.

However, studies comparing cancer detection rates (CDRs) according to biopsy methods in real-world practice are scarce.

Materials and methods:   From 2006 to 2015, patients who underwent PBx were initially selected. All patients were categorized according to the biopsy methods performed (magnetic resonance imaging targeted biopsy [MR-TBx], 12+2 hypoechoic lesion target biopsy, saturation biopsy [sPBx], extended biopsy, and 12-core PBx). The CDR of MR-TBx was compared to that of sPBx and other protocols. Volume per core (VPC) was defined as prostate volume divided by the number of biopsy cores. Patients previously diagnosed with PCa were excluded.  Results:   Of the 1,598 patients (median PSA, 5.41 ng/mL), 401 (25.1%) were diagnosed with PCa. Among the biopsy methods, MR-TBx has the highest CDR and proportion of Gleason score ≥7 (3+4). Biopsy methods, VPC, age, prostate volume, and PSA were associated with PCa detection. In the sub-analysis for initial biopsy, MR-TBx had no significant difference with sPBx, but had higher CDR than the other biopsy protocols. For repeat biopsy, VPC, rather than the biopsy method, was associated with CDR.  Conclusions:   This study reaffirmed the efficacy of MR-TBx on CDR in real-world practice.

Here, we use a series of prostate-specific membrane antigen-binding single-domain (Humabody) ADC constructs to demonstrate that tissue penetration of protein-drug conjugates plays a major role in therapeutic efficacy. Counterintuitively, a construct with lower in vitro potency resulted in higher in vivo efficacy than other protein-drug conjugates. Biodistribution data, tumor histology images, spheroid experiments, in vivo single-cell measurements, and computational results demonstrate that a smaller size and slower internalization rate enabled higher tissue penetration and more cell killing. The results also illustrate the benefits of linking an albumin-binding domain to the single-domain ADCs. A construct lacking an albumin-binding domain was rapidly cleared, leading to lower tumor uptake (%ID/g) and decreased in vivo efficacy. In conclusion, these results provide evidence that reaching the maximum number of cells with a lethal payload dose correlates more strongly with in vivo efficacy than total tumor uptake or in vitro potency alone for these protein-drug conjugates. Computational modeling and protein engineering can be used to custom design an optimal framework for controlling internalization, clearance, and tissue penetration to maximize cell killing. SIGNIFICANCE: A mechanistic study of protein-drug conjugates demonstrates that a lower potency compound is more effective in vivo than other agents with equal tumor uptake due to improved tissue penetration and cellular distribution.""","""['Ian Nessler', 'Eshita Khera', 'Steven Vance', 'Anna Kopp', 'Qifeng Qiu', 'Thomas A Keating', 'Adnan O Abu-Yousif', 'Thomas Sandal', 'James Legg', 'Lorraine Thompson', 'Normann Goodwin', 'Greg M Thurber']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Cancer Res""","""['An Agent-Based Systems Pharmacology Model of the Antibody-Drug Conjugate Kadcyla to Predict Efficacy of Different Dosing Regimens.', 'Characterization of Site-Specifically Conjugated Monomethyl Auristatin E- and Duocarmycin-Based Anti-PSMA Antibody-Drug Conjugates for Treatment of PSMA-Expressing Tumors.', 'Improved Tumor Penetration and Single-Cell Targeting of Antibody-Drug Conjugates Increases Anticancer Efficacy and Host Survival.', 'Design of next generation antibody drug conjugates.', 'Pharmacokinetic Considerations for Antibody-Drug Conjugates against Cancer.', 'Albumin binding improves nanobody pharmacokinetics for dual-modality PET/NIRF imaging of CEACAM5 in colorectal cancer models.', 'Antibody drug conjugates as targeted cancer therapy: past development, present challenges and future opportunities.', ""Let's Go 3D!

Several novel therapeutic agents have been developed for castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), but the prognosis for patients with CRPC remains poor. The identification of novel therapeutic targets for CRPC is an urgent issue. Exosomes are small vesicles secreted by a variety of cells, and exosomes derived from cancer cells have been reported to circulate in the patient's bodily fluids, promoting metastasis and invasion. We aimed to identify novel therapeutic targets for CRPC by proteomic analysis of serum exosomes. Exosomes were isolated by ultracentrifugation of sera from 36 men with metastatic prostate cancer: untreated (n = 8), well-controlled with primary androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) (n = 8), and CRPC (n = 20). We identified 823 proteins in the serum exosomes. Six proteins were increased in CRPC patients compared with untreated patients. In contrast, only ACTN4 was increased in the CRPC patients compared to the ADT patients. We focused on ACTN4 as a candidate for targeted therapeutics. ACTN4 was highly expressed in the prostate cancer cell line DU145 as well as exosomes from this line. RNA interference-mediated downregulation of ACTN4 significantly attenuated cell proliferation and invasion in DU145 cells.

Hence, we develop a qualitative transcriptional signature based on REOs to predict the biochemical recurrence risk of prostate cancer (PCa) patients after radical prostatectomy.  Methods:   Gene pairs with REOs significantly correlated with the biochemical recurrence-free survival (BFS) were identified from 131 PCa samples in the training data set. From these gene pairs, we selected a qualitative transcriptional signature based on the within-sample REOs of gene pairs which could predict the recurrence risk of PCa patients after radical prostatectomy.  Results:   A signature consisting of 74 gene pairs, named 74-GPS, was developed for predicting the recurrence risk of PCa patients after radical prostatectomy based on the majority voting rule that a sample was assigned as high risk when at least 37 gene pairs of the 74-GPS voted for high risk; otherwise, low risk. The signature was validated in six independent datasets produced by different platforms. In each of the validation datasets, the Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed that the average BFS of the low-risk group was significantly better than that of the high-risk group. Analyses of multiomics data of PCa samples from TCGA suggested that both the epigenomic and genomic alternations could cause the reproducible transcriptional differences between the two different prognostic groups.  Conclusions:   The proposed qualitative transcriptional signature can robustly stratify PCa patients after radical prostatectomy into two groups with different recurrence risk and distinct multiomics characteristics. Hence, 74-GPS may serve as a helpful tool for guiding the management of PCa patients with radical prostatectomy at the individual level.""","""['Xiang Li', 'Haiyan Huang', 'Jiahui Zhang', 'Fengle Jiang', 'Yating Guo', 'Yidan Shi', 'Zheng Guo', 'Lu Ao']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Epigenetic signature of Gleason score and prostate cancer recurrence after radical prostatectomy.', 'A TMEFF2-regulated cell cycle derived gene signature is prognostic of recurrence risk in prostate cancer.', 'A 17-gene assay to predict prostate cancer aggressiveness in the context of Gleason grade heterogeneity, tumor multifocality, and biopsy undersampling.', 'Tissue-Based MicroRNAs as Predictors of Biochemical Recurrence after Radical Prostatectomy: What Can We Learn from Past Studies?', 'MiRNAs and radical prostatectomy: Current data, bioinformatic analysis and utility as predictors of tumour relapse.', 'A transcriptomic signature for prostate cancer relapse prediction identified from the differentially expressed genes between TP53 mutant and wild-type tumors.', ""Development of a Convolutional Neural Network-Based Colonoscopy Image Assessment Model for Differentiating Crohn's Disease and Ulcerative Colitis.""]"""

Purpose:   To 1) quantify LWI parameters and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) in PCa and benign peripheral zone (PZ) tissues; and 2) evaluate the diagnostic performance of LWI, ADC, and PI-RADS parameters for differentiation between low- and high-grade PCa lesions.  Study type:   Prospective.  Subjects:   Twenty-six PCa patients undergoing prostatectomy (mean age 59 years, range 46-72 years).  Field strength/sequence:   Multiparametric MRI at 3.0T, including diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and LWI T2 mapping.  Assessment:   LWI parameters and ADC were quantified in index PCa lesions and benign PZ.  Statistical tests:   Differences in MRI parameters between PCa and benign PZ were assessed using Wilcoxon signed tests. Spearman correlation of pathological grade group (GG) with LWI parameters, ADC, and PI-RADS was evaluated. The utility of each of the parameters for differentiation between low-grade (GG ≤2) and high-grade (GG ≥3) PCa was determined by Mann-Whitney U tests and ROC analyses.  Results:   Twenty-six index lesions were analyzed (mean size 1.7 ± 0.8 cm, GG: 1 [n = 1; 4%], 2 [n = 14, 54%], 3 [n = 8, 31%], 5 [n = 3, 12%]). LWI parameters and ADC both showed high diagnostic performance for differentiation between benign PZ and PCa (highest area under the curve [AUC] for LWI parameter T2,short [AUC = 0.98, P < 0.001]). The LWI parameters luminal water fraction (LWF) and amplitude of long T2 component Along significantly correlated with GG (r = -0.441, P = 0.024 and r = -0.414, P = 0.036, respectively), while PI-RADS, ADC, and the other LWI parameters did not (P = 0.132-0.869).

Methods:   We identified cancer and noncancer-related causes of death using data from the 2000-2016 national cancer registry in Korea (n = 2 707 520), and we characterized the leading causes of death and proportionate mortalities over time. Risks of noncancer deaths relative to the general population were estimated using standardized mortality ratios (SMRs).  Results:   Of 1 105 607 identified deaths, 87% were due to the primary cancer. Proportionate mortalities of primary cancer among overall deaths remained high in patients with liver (86%) and lung (70%) cancers and in female patients with breast cancer (77%), even 5 to 10 years following diagnosis, whereas proportionate mortalities reduced to ≤50% in patients with stomach (men, 39%; women, 48%), prostate (47%), and female thyroid (27%) cancers.

Although these recurrent tumors typically remain dependent on the androgen receptor (AR), non-AR-driven tumors that also emerge are particularly deadly and becoming more prevalent. Here, we present a new genetically engineered mouse model for non-AR-driven prostate cancer that centers on a negative regulator of G protein-coupled receptors that is downregulated in aggressive human prostate tumors. Thus, prostate-specific expression of a dominant-negative G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 (GRK2-DN) transgene diminishes AR and AR target gene expression in the prostate, and confers resistance to castration-induced involution. Further, the GRK2-DN transgene dramatically accelerates oncogene-initiated prostate tumorigenesis by increasing primary tumor size, potentiating visceral organ metastasis, suppressing AR, and inducing neuroendocrine marker mRNAs. In summary, GRK2 enforces AR-dependence in the prostate, and the loss of GRK2 function in prostate tumors accelerates disease progression toward the deadliest stage.""","""['Adam J Adler', 'Payal Mittal', 'Adam T Hagymasi', 'Antoine Menoret', 'Chen Shen', 'Federica Agliano', 'Kyle T Wright', 'James J Grady', 'Chia-Ling Kuo', 'Enrique Ballesteros', 'Kevin P Claffey', 'Anthony T Vella']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Oncogene""","""['Context dependent regulatory patterns of the androgen receptor and androgen receptor target genes.', 'Androgen receptor-dependent and -independent mechanisms driving prostate cancer progression: Opportunities for therapeutic targeting from multiple angles.', 'In vivo knockdown of the androgen receptor results in growth inhibition and regression of well-established, castration-resistant prostate tumors.', 'Testosterone boosts for treatment of castration resistant prostate cancer: an experimental implementation of intermittent androgen deprivation.', 'A novel GPCR target in correlation with androgen deprivation therapy for prostate cancer drug discovery.']"""

Nevertheless, the majority of advanced-stage prostate cancer patients, including those with SPINK1-positive subtype, are treated with AR-antagonists. Here, we show AR and its corepressor, REST, function as transcriptional-repressors of SPINK1, and AR-antagonists alleviate this repression leading to SPINK1 upregulation. Increased SOX2 expression during NE-transdifferentiation transactivates SPINK1, a critical-player for maintenance of NE-phenotype. SPINK1 elicits epithelial-mesenchymal-transition, stemness and cellular-plasticity. Conversely, pharmacological Casein Kinase-1 inhibition stabilizes REST, which in cooperation with AR causes SPINK1 transcriptional-repression and impedes SPINK1-mediated oncogenesis. Elevated levels of SPINK1 and NEPC markers are observed in the tumors of AR-antagonists treated mice, and in a subset of NEPC patients, implicating a plausible role of SPINK1 in treatment-related NEPC.

The introduction of new robotic technology is challenging and requires studies followed by technique adaptions.  Objective:   This study aims to report a logical and technologically safe approach to the learning curve using the da Vinci single-port (SP) console and describes our robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP) technique step by step.  Design, setting, and participants:   A prospective study from 26 consecutive patients who underwent RARP with the da Vinci SP console from June to August 2019.  Surgical procedure:   All surgeries were performed with a transperitoneal technique; one robotic trocar was placed above the umbilicus and one additional 12 mm trocar was placed in the right lower quadrant.  Measurements:   We described the step-by-step technique and reported the perioperative and pathological data. In addition, we considered the hospital length of stay and pain scale following surgery. Continuous variables were reported as median and interquartile ranges. Categorical variables were reported as frequencies and proportions.  Result and limitations:   The total median operative time was 121 min, console time was 85 min, and blood loss was 50 ml. No complications were reported. In the final pathology, four patients had Gleason 6, 20 had Gleason 7, one had Gleason 8, and one had Gleason 9.Of the patients, 70% were ≤pT2 and 30% were ≥pT3a. Only 11% had positive surgical margins. This study is limited by the small number of patients and a short period of follow-up to evaluate functional and oncological outcomes of this new technology.  Conclusions:   RARP with the da Vinci SP is feasible and safe. Therefore, the step-by-step technique described in this study could be considered an option to perform radical prostatectomies. However, we still need better-designed studies to compare the outcomes with those of the multiport platform.

Materials and methods:   A retrospective analysis was performed on 1,053 patients receiving BT ± external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) ± hormone therapy (HT) for NCCN low, intermediate, or high-risk PCa between 1990 and 2011. Patients were categorized as not receiving HT (n = 438, 41.6%), ≤6 months (n = 317, 31.1%) or > 6 months (n = 298, 28.3%) of HT. 572 (54.3%) received BT alone, and 481 had combination therapy. The five- and 10-year freedom from persistent hypogonadism (T < 280 ng/dL) and castration (T < 50 ng/dL) for each group was evaluated with Kaplan-Meier estimates. Multivariable cox proportional hazards models were used to compare the risk of persistent hypogonadism and castration at a median followup of 6.5 years (posttreatment to final T) (IQR: 4.3-9.1 years; range: 1.0-19.2 years).  Results:   The 5-year freedom from hypogonadism rates were 92.4%, 88.9%, and 87.0% for patients with no HT, ≤ 6 months and >6 months of HT, respectively (10-year rates: 66.7%, 55.3%, 40.5%); p < 0.01. The 5-year freedom from castration rates were 99.2%, 98.0%, and 98.4%, respectively (10-year rates: 97.9%, 95.5%, 90.9%); p = 0.078. Number of months of HT (HR = 1.04, p = 0.030) and BT with EBRT vs. BT alone (HR = 1.56, p = 0.010) significantly increased the risk of persistent hypogonadism. Number of months of HT was the only variable which increased the risk of persistent castration (HR = 1.09, p = 0.014).  Conclusions:   The addition of EBRT to BT is an independent risk factor for persistent hypogonadism.

The approved radium-223 regimen is 55 kBq/kg every 4 weeks (q4w) for six cycles (standard dose). We investigated different radium-223 regimens in patients with mCRPC.  Patients and methods:   Patients were randomised 1 : 1 : 1 to radium-223 standard-dose, high-dose (88 kBq/kg q4w for six cycles) or extended-schedule arms (55 kBq/kg q4w for 12 cycles). The primary end point, SSE-free survival (SSE-FS), was compared in patients treated with a high- versus standard-dose regimen, or with a standard dose in an extended (>6 to 12 cycles) versus standard schedule (six cycles).  Results:   A total of 391 patients were randomised; baseline characteristics were balanced between arms. On-treatment SSEs developed in 37/130 (28%), 42/130 (32%) and 48/131 (37%) patients in the standard-dose, high-dose and extended-schedule arms, respectively. There was no statistically significant difference in SSE-FS in the high- versus standard-dose arms [median 12.9 months versus 12.3 months; hazard ratio (HR) 1.06, 80% confidence interval (CI) 0.88-1.27, P = 0.70], and in the extended- versus standard-schedule arms (median 10.8 months versus 13.2 months; HR 1.26, 80% CI 0.94-1.69, P = 0.31). Overall survival in the three treatment arms was similar. As many as 370 (95%) patients received treatment (median of six cycles) in each arm. Grade ≥3 treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) affected 34% of patients in the standard-dose, 48% in the high-dose and 53% in the extended-schedule arm, causing permanent discontinuation in 9%, 16% and 17% of patients, respectively.  Conclusion:   Radium-223 high-dose or extended-schedule regimens resulted in no change in SSE-FS or other efficacy end points and were associated with more grade ≥3 TEAEs. The extended-schedule regimen (beyond six doses) could not be implemented in a large proportion of patients due to disease progression.

Thus, BCa and PCa patients are given therapies that reduce hormone levels or directly block HR activity; but most patients eventually develop treatment resistance. We have previously reported that interleukin-1 (IL-1) inflammatory cytokine downregulates ERα and AR mRNA in HR-positive (HR+) BCa and PCa cell lines, yet the cells can remain viable. Additionally, we identified pro-survival proteins and processes upregulated by IL-1 in HR+ BCa and PCa cells, that are basally high in HR- BCa and PCa cells. Therefore, we hypothesize that IL-1 confers a conserved gene expression pattern in HR+ BCa and PCa cells that mimics conserved basal gene expression patterns in HR- BCa and PCa cells to promote HR-independent survival and tumorigenicity.  Methods:   We performed RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) for HR+ BCa and PCa cell lines exposed to IL-1 and for untreated HR- BCa and PCa cell lines. We confirmed expression patterns of select genes by RT-qPCR and used siRNA and/or drug inhibition to silence select genes in the BCa and PCa cell lines. Finally, we performed Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) and used the gene ontology web-based tool, GOrilla, to identify signaling pathways encoded by our RNA-seq data set.  Results:   We identified 350 genes in common between BCa and PCa cells that are induced or repressed by IL-1 in HR+ cells that are, respectively, basally high or low in HR- cells. Among these genes, we identified Sequestome-1 (SQSTM1/p62) and SRY (Sex-Determining Region Y)-Box 9 (SOX9) to be essential for survival of HR- BCa and PCa cell lines. Analysis of publicly available data indicates that p62 and SOX9 expression are elevated in HR-independent BCa and PCa sublines generated in vitro, suggesting that p62 and SOX9 have a role in acquired hormone receptor independence and treatment resistance. We also assessed HR- cell line viability in response to the p62-targeting drug, verteporfin, and found that verteporfin is cytotoxic for HR- cell lines.

The competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) network is well-known in modulating the pathological and physiological processes of tumors. Still and all, the function role of oncogenic lncRNA PCGEM1 prostate-specific transcript (PCGEM1) in renal carcinoma was undefined till now. This paper aimed to figure out the role and mechanism of PCGEM1 in renal carcinoma. In this study, PCGEM1 was observed to be lifted in renal carcinoma cells. Loss-of-function experiments displayed that silencing of PCGEM1 repressed cell proliferation and migration, and activated apoptosis in renal carcinoma. FISH assay and subcellular fractionation assay indicated that PCGEM1 was largely located in the cytoplasm. As demonstrated, PCGEM1 interacted with microRNA433-3p (miR-433-3p). Subsequently, luciferase reporter and RIP experiments together with qRT-PCR certified that PCGEM1 and fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) functioned as ceRNA for miR-433-3p, leading to the upregulation of FGF2 expression. Finally, rescue assays exhibited that FGF2 overexpression rescued the inhibited cell progression caused by PCGEM1 downregulation. MiR-433-3p inhibitor could reverse the cell growth and migration caused by PCGEM1 downregulation. The present research investigated the molecular mechanism underlying PCGEM1 in renal carcinoma, exposing a PCGEM1-mediated therapy for the treatment of patients with renal carcinoma.""","""['Xianguo Cai', 'Xianjun Zhang', 'Licai Mo', 'Jialiang Zhu', 'Hongyuan Yu']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Cancer Biomark""","""['Long Noncoding RNA PCGEM1 Facilitates Tumor Growth and Metastasis of Osteosarcoma by Sponging miR-433-3p and Targeting OMA1.', 'LncRNA PCGEM1 enhances metastasis and gastric cancer invasion through targeting of miR-129-5p to regulate P4HA2 expression.', 'HOXD-AS1 facilitates cell migration and invasion as an oncogenic lncRNA by competitively binding to miR-877-3p and upregulating FGF2 in human cervical cancer.', 'A review on the role of PCGEM1 lncRNA in cancer.', 'Long Non-Coding RNAs as Novel Biomarkers in the Clinical Management of Papillary Renal Cell Carcinoma Patients: A Promise or a Pledge?', 'PCGEM1 promotes cell proliferation and migration in endometriosis by targeting miR-124-3p-mediated ANTXR2 expression.', 'Long Noncoding RNA PCGEM1 Facilitates Tumor Growth and Metastasis of Osteosarcoma by Sponging miR-433-3p and Targeting OMA1.', 'A review on the role of long non-coding RNA and microRNA network in clear cell renal cell carcinoma and its tumor microenvironment.', 'lncRNA PCGEM1 Regulates the Progress of Colorectal Cancer through Targeting miR-129-5p/SOX4.', 'The role of MiRNA-433 in malignant tumors of digestive tract as tumor suppressor.']"""

This study aimed to reveal observer uncertainties of soft-tissue-based patient positioning on cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) images for prostate cancer IGRT.  Methods:   Twenty-six patients (7-8 fractions/patient, total number of 204 fractions) who underwent IGRT for prostate cancer were selected. Six radiation therapists retrospectively measured prostate cancer location errors (PCLEs) of soft-tissue-based patient positioning between planning CT (pCT) and pretreatment CBCT (pre-CBCT) images after automatic bone-based registration. Observer uncertainties were evaluated based on residual errors, which denoted the differences between soft-tissue and reference positioning errors. Reference positioning errors were obtained as PCLEs of contour-based patient positioning between pCT and pre-CBCT images. Intraobserver variations were obtained from the difference between the first and second soft-tissue-based patient positioning repeated by the same observer for each fraction. Systematic and random errors of inter- and intraobserver variations were calculated in anterior-posterior (AP), superior-inferior (SI), and left-right (LR) directions. Finally, clinical target volume (CTV)-to-planning target volume (PTV) margins were obtained from systematic and random errors of inter- and intraobserver variations in AP, SI, and LR directions.  Results:   Interobserver variations in AP, SI, and LR directions were 0.9, 0.9, and 0.5 mm, respectively, for the systematic error, and 1.8, 2.2, and 1.1 mm, respectively, for random error. Intraobserver variations were <0.2 mm in all directions. CTV-to-PTV margins in AP, SI, and LR directions were 3.5, 3.8, and 2.1 mm, respectively.  Conclusion:   Intraobserver variability was sufficiently small and would be negligible. However, uncertainties due to interobserver variability for soft-tissue-based patient positioning using CBCT images should be considered in CTV-to-PTV margins.""","""['Taka-Aki Hirose', 'Hidetaka Arimura', 'Jun-Ichi Fukunaga', 'Saiji Ohga', 'Tadamasa Yoshitake', 'Yoshiyuki Shioyama']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""J Appl Clin Med Phys""","""['Adaptive radiotherapy and the dosimetric impact of inter- and intrafractional motion on the planning target volume for prostate cancer patients.', 'The potential failure risk of the cone-beam computed tomography-based planning target volume margin definition for prostate image-guided radiotherapy based on a prospective single-institutional hybrid analysis.', 'Impact of computed tomography image quality on image-guided radiation therapy based on soft tissue registration.', 'A systematic review and meta-analysis of liver tumor position variability during SBRT using various motion management and IGRT strategies.', 'Image-guided Adaptive Radiotherapy for Bladder Cancer.', 'Evaluating the impact of possible interobserver variability in CBCT-based soft-tissue matching using TCP/NTCP models for prostate cancer radiotherapy.', 'Factors affecting accuracy and precision in ultrasound guided radiotherapy.', 'Evaluation of the XVI dual registration tool for image-guided radiotherapy in prostate cancer.']"""

In this study, the effects of the lncRNA BLACAT1 in prostate cancer were investigated.  Patients and methods:   Real-time PCR was used to detect the expression of BLACAT1 and miR-361 in prostate cancer tissues and adjacent normal tissues (n=25). The function of BLACAT1 was detected through proliferation assay and apoptosis assay. The interaction between BLACAT1 and miR-361 in prostate cancer was studied by luciferase assay, RNA immunoprecipitation assay and chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis were performed to detect the BLACAT1 binding proteins. The xenograft mice experiment was performed to further confirm the functional significance of lncRNA BLACAT1 in vivo.  Results:   In patient samples and prostate cancer cell lines, BLACAT1 was down-regulated and inversely proportional to DNMT1, HDAC1, EZH2, MDM2 and miR-361 expression. Treatment with 5-azacytidine and chidamide enhanced BLACAT1 expression and decreased the levels of miR-361. The BALCAT1 promoter was methylated in prostate cancer tissue and found to interact with miR-361 via luciferase assays. BLACAT1 bound to EZH2, DNMT1 and HDAC1. ChIP-seq analysis revealed that HDAC1 interacts with STAT3, while EZH2 interacts with the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) promoter.  Conclusions:   Two regulatory axes of BLACAT1-EZH2-MAPK and BLACAT1-HDAC1-STAT3 were identified to be associated with the progression of prostate cancer.

Personal resilience might increase people's ability to manage life's challenges. However, limited study to explore their relationships. This study examined the relationships among lower urinary symptoms, resilience, and post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) in post-surgery patients with rectal cancer.  Methods:   A cross-sectional study design was used and included 188 patients with diagnosed rectal cancer who had undergone surgery over 24 months and were recruited from a hospital in southern Taiwan. The outcome measurements included a resilience scale, International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS), the Chinese Davidson Trauma Scale, personal characteristics, and disease-related variables.  Results:   There were significant relationships among age at diagnosed, self-reported physical status, perceived satisfied with recovery, urinary tract symptoms, resilience, and overall PTSS. The stepwise regression demonstrated that five factors, self-reported physical status, resilience, urinary tract symptoms, age at diagnosed and gender, and together explained 27.7% of overall PTSS variance (10.7, 6.7, 3.7, 4.8 and 1.8% of variance, respectively).  Conclusion:   The study demonstrates that patients with diagnosed rectal cancers long-term outcomes of PTSS, urinary tract symptoms, and resilience after surgery; in addition, self-reported physical status, resilience, urinary tract symptoms, age at diagnosed and gender are the major predictors of PTSS.

Secondary objectives: To determine the proportion of men who had csPCa detected only by PSMA-PET/CT or only by systematic prostate biopsy; to compare index lesions by template biopsies vs targeted lesions identified on mpMRI or PSMA-PET/CT; to assess whether there may be health economic benefit or harm if PSMA-PET/CT is incorporated into the diagnostic algorithm; and to develop a nomogram which combines clinical, imaging and biomarker data to predict the likelihood of csPCa.  Patients and methods:   The PRIMARY trial is a multicentre, prospective, cross-sectional study that meets the criteria for level 1 evidence in diagnostic test evaluation. PRIMARY will investigate if a limited (pelvic-only) PSMA-PET/CT in combination with routine mpMRI can reliably discriminate men with csPCa from those without csPCa. We conducted a power calculation based on pilot data and will recruit up to 600 men who will undergo PSMA-PET/CT (the index test), mpMRI (standard test) and transperineal template + targeted (PSMA-PET/CT and/or mpMRI) biopsies (reference test). The conduct and reporting of the mpMRI and PSMA-PET/CT will be blinded to each other.  Results:   The PRIMARY trial will measure and compare sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value of both mpMRI and PSMA-PET/CT vs targeted prostrate biopsy. The results will be used to determine the proportion of men who could safely avoid biopsy without compromising detection of csPCa. Furthermore, we will assess whether there is a health economic benefit in incorporating PSMA-PET/CT into the diagnostic algorithm.

Curcumin is one of the most extensively investigated phytochemicals with a wide range of therapeutic properties and has been shown to induce strong photocytotoxic effects in micromolar concentrations against a variety of cancer cell lines. Curcumin (1) is comparatively evaluated with the naturally occurring bisdemethoxy Curcumin (2), which lacks the two methoxy groups, as well as two newly synthesized curcuminoids, the cinnamaldehyde derivative (3) and the dimethylamino one (4), designed to increase the absorption maximum and hence the tissue penetration. The synthetic curcuminoids were successfully synthesized in sufficient amounts and their photophysical properties such as absorption, fluorescence, photobleaching and free radical generation were investigated. Compound 4 exhibited a significant increase in peak absorption (497 nm) and strong fluorescent emission signals were recorded for all curcuminoids. Photobleaching of 4 was comparable to 1 whereas 2 and 3 showed more extended photobleaching but much higher ROS production in very short irradiation times. Compounds 2 and 4 exhibited specific intracellular localization. After dark and light cytotoxicity experiments against LNCaP prostate cancer cell line for all curcuminoids, concentration of 3 μM and irradiance of 6 mW cm-2 were selected for the PDT application which resulted in remarkable results with very short LD50.

Moreover, the signaling pathways were also explored by western blot analysis and quantitative polymerase chain reaction assays. We found that PRPS2 was dramatically upregulated in prostate adenocarcinoma tissues in comparison with normal tissues, and that increased PRPS2 was linked intimately to advanced clinical stage and pT status. Functional experiments showed that knockdown of PRPS2 significantly suppressed cell growth both in vitro and in vivo. In addition, depletion of PRPS2 induced G1 phase cell cycle arrest and elevated cell apoptosis. Silencing of PRPS2 resulted in the decreased expression of Bcl‑2 and cyclinD1 and increased levels of Bax, cleavage of caspases‑3, caspases‑9 and PARP.

Thus, simultaneous inhibition of all Hsp90 paralogs is a reasonable strategy for cancer therapy. However, since the existing pan-Hsp90 inhibitor does not accumulate in mitochondria, the potential anticancer activity of pan-Hsp90 inhibition has not yet been fully examined in vivo. Analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas database revealed that all Hsp90 paralogs were upregulated in prostate cancer. Inactivation of all Hsp90 paralogs induced mitochondrial dysfunction, increased cytosolic calcium, and activated calcineurin. Active calcineurin blocked prosurvival heat shock responses upon Hsp90 inhibition by preventing nuclear translocation of HSF1. The purine scaffold derivative DN401 inhibited all Hsp90 paralogs simultaneously and showed stronger anticancer activity than other Hsp90 inhibitors. Pan-Hsp90 inhibition increased cytotoxicity and suppressed mechanisms that protect cancer cells, suggesting that it is a feasible strategy for the development of potent anticancer drugs.

We conducted a prostatic biopsy and the pathological findings showed prostate cancer. The Combined Androgen Blockade (CAB) therapy was effective in reducing PSA value and shrinkage of the paraaortic lymph nodes. After the blood coagulation ability was improved to a normal state, we changed the anticoagulant treatment to subcutaneous injection of heparin Ca. There was no recurrence of cerebral infarction and no regrowth of prostate cancer 6 months after CAB therapy. Trousseau's syndrome is known as a poor prognosis syndrome because there is no effective therapy for the advanced stage of the accompanying cancer. However, CAB therapy is effective for advanced prostate cancer and long-term prognosis is expected. Starting anticoagulant treatment at the acute stage and maintaining anticoagulant treatment at the chronic stage are important in the treatment of Trousseau's syndrome accompanied with prostate cancer.""","""['Yuki Kohada', 'Kenshiro Takemoto', 'Akihiro Goriki', 'Mitsuru Kajiwara']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Nihon Hinyokika Gakkai Zasshi""","""[""A case of pancreatic head cancer with Trousseau's syndrome treated with radical resection and anticoagulant therapy."", ""A Case of Early-Onset Rapidly Progressive Cerebral Infarction with Trousseau's Syndrome in a Patient with Pancreatic Cancer Undergoing Surgery."", ""A case of successful anesthetic management in a patient with Trousseau's syndrome who underwent surgery for malignant ovarian tumor."", ""A Case of StageIV Gastric Cancer with Development of Trousseau's Syndrome during Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy."", 'Catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome associated with malignancies (case report and review of the literature).']"""

(Patients and methods) The study cohort consisted of 926 hormone-naïve patients with localized prostate cancer who underwent LRP at the Hiroshima Endourological Association from January 2007 to December 2016. (Results) The mean age was 69.4 years, the mean initial PSA was 9.1 ng/ml, and the mean follow-up period was 40.3 months. The D'Amico Risk Classification was Low: 232 cases, Intermediate: 344 cases, and High: 350 cases. Nerve preservation was performed bilaterally for 138 patients and unilaterally for 181 patients. The mean operative time was 181.0 minutes and the mean estimated blood loss was 360.7 ml. As the number of experienced cases increased, the operative time was significantly shorter and the estimated blood loss was significantly decreased. According to Clavien-Dindo classification, the ratio of perioperative complication degree IIIa or above was 4.0% (37 cases). The pathological results were Gleason score (GS) ≤6: 174 cases, GS7: 514 cases, GS ≥8: 232 cases, pT2≥: 704 cases, pT3a: 172 cases, pT3b: 47 cases, pT4: 3 cases, pN0: 917 cases, and pN1: 9 cases.

In this study, we evaluated the trends of utilization of surgical castration and also assess the survival differences of patients who underwent surgical castration when compared with those who underwent medical castration.  Materials and methods:   The National Cancer Database was used to identify patients with metastatic prostate cancer from 2004 to 2014. Cochran-Armitage tests were used to assess temporal trends in the proportion of patients receiving surgical castration relative to medical castration. Logistic and Cox regression models were utilized to estimate the odds of utilization of surgical castration and the effect of castration on overall survival (OS).  Results:   A total of 33,585 patients with metastatic prostate cancer were identified; 31,600 (94.1%) had medical castration, and 1985 (5.9%) underwent surgical castration. There was significant decline in the trend of utilization of surgical castration from 8.6% in 2004 to 3.1% in 2014. On multivariable analysis, being of a non-Caucasian race, having lower median income levels, having non-private insurance, and earlier years of diagnosis were found to be associated with increased odds of choosing surgical castration over medical castration. Notably, the odds of surgical castration were lower at academic centers. On univariable analysis, a survival difference between castration modality was evidenced (P < .01); 5-year OS for medical castration and surgical castration were 24.3% and 18.2%, respectively. However, on multivariable analysis, there was no OS difference between surgical castration and medical castration (P = .13).  Conclusions:   In this large contemporary analysis, the utilization of surgical castration has declined over time, with no OS difference when compared with medical castration. Increasing the utilization of surgical castration could help reduce health care expenditures. With rising health care costs, patients and physicians need to be aware of treatment options and their financial implications.""","""['Rohan Garje', 'Adithya Chennamadhavuni', 'Sarah L Mott', 'Isaac Matthew Chambers', 'Paul Gellhaus', 'Yousef Zakharia', 'James A Brown']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Clin Genitourin Cancer""","""['Impact of the National Health Fund policy on hormone treatment for prostate cancer in Jamaica.', 'Differential use of medical versus surgical androgen deprivation therapy for patients with metastatic prostate cancer.', 'Managed care implications in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Androgen deprivation falls as orchiectomy rates rise after changes in reimbursement in the U.S. Medicare population.', 'Targeting Metastatic Hormone Sensitive Prostate Cancer: Chemohormonal Therapy and New Combinatorial Approaches.', 'Association between the Immunophenotype of Peripheral Blood from mCRPC Patients and the Outcomes of Radium-223 Treatment.', 'Cardiovascular Impact of Androgen Deprivation Therapy: from Basic Biology to Clinical Practice.', 'Luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonists versus orchiectomy in the treatment of prostate cancer: A systematic review.', 'Significant financial differences of chemical and surgical androgen deprivation in a contemporary cohort.', 'What Is Your Choice for Androgen Deprivation Therapy in Metastatic Prostate Carcinoma: Surgical or Medical?']"""

Patients and methods:   We used the Swedish Renal Register and the National Prostate Cancer Register to identify all kidney transplantation recipients diagnosed with prostate cancer in Sweden 1998-2016. After linking these registers with Prostate Cancer Database Sweden (PCBaSe), a case-control study was designed to compare time period and risk category-specific probabilities of a prostate cancer diagnosis amongst kidney transplantation recipients versus the male general population. The registers did not include information about the specific immunosuppression agent used in all transplantation recipients. Data from PCBaSe were used to compare prostate cancer characteristics at diagnosis and survival for patients with prostate cancer with versus without a kidney transplant. Propensity score matching, Cox regression analysis and Fisher's exact test were used and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) calculated.  Results:   Almost half of the 133 kidney transplantation recipients were transplanted before the mid-1990s, when PSA testing became common. The transplant recipients were not more likely than age-matched control men to be diagnosed with any (odds ratio [OR] 0.84, 95% CI 0.70-0.99) or high-risk or metastatic prostate cancer (OR 0.84, 95% CI 0.62-1.13). None of the ORs for the different categories of prostate cancer increased with time since transplantation. Cancer characteristics at the time of diagnosis and cancer-specific survival were similar amongst transplant recipients and the control group of 665 men diagnosed with prostate cancer without a kidney transplant.

Studies have shown that AR-V7 is a potential surrogate for selecting drug classes for systemic treatment by detecting nuclear AR-V7 by immunofluorescence or measuring AR-V7 messenger RNA by quantitative PCR. Here, we assessed the predictive value of AR-V7 detected by classical immunohistochemistry (IHC) for treatment response.  Methods:   CTCs were isolated by cell separation by density gradient centrifugation from patients with metastatic CRPC (n = 26) before, while, and after undergoing a new therapy with chemotherapy (cabazitaxel or docetaxel) or antiandrogen (enzalutamide or abiraterone). CTCs were sequentially cytospun on object slides, and AR-V7 status was then detected by IHC based on a staining regime established on a 22Rv1 cell line with antibodies against CK8/18 und AR-V7.  Results:   AR-V7 status detected by IHC showed no predictive value for progression-free survival (PFS). Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed that there was no difference in PFS between patients found positive or negative for AR-V7.

Materials and methods:   Men with nmPCa receiving primary curative radiotherapy were identified from SA Prostate Cancer Clinical Outcomes Collaborative database. Adjuvant, salvage and palliative therapies were excluded. Associations between socio-demographic factors (age, residence, socio-economic status, diagnostic period) and radiotherapy mode (external beam radiotherapy [EBRT] vs. brachytherapy [BT]) and technique (low-dose-rate vs. high-dose-rate brachytherapy) were investigated using multivariable logistic regression with separate models for clinical risk categories.  Results:   Of the 1874 men who underwent primary RT, 80% received EBRT and 20% BT. For low and intermediate risk disease, likelihood of receiving EBRT was higher among older men (ORlow = 3.08; 95% CI 1.82-5.22 and ORintermediate = 3.48; 2.28-5.31 for 65-74 yrs vs. <65 yrs) and lower among regional/remote compared with metropolitan residents (ORlow = 0.34; 0.17-0.67 and ORintermediate = 0.57; 0.34-0.94). For intermediate and high risk disease, more recent diagnosis was associated with decreased likelihood of EBRT (ORintermediate = 0.22; 95% CI 0.15-0.33 and ORhigh = 0.50; 0.29-0.88, respectively). Among men receiving BT, low-dose-rate BT use decreased over time for low (OR = 0.19; 0.04-0.89) and intermediate risk disease (OR = 0.32; 0.12-0.84). Dose escalation and intensity modulation for EBRT increased after 2010.  Conclusion:   Over the last decade substantial changes in RT for nmPCa were observed. Older age and more remote residence may be barriers to accessing specific types of RT. Further research to understand how these factors affect access is warranted to improve service provision.""","""['Stamati Morias', 'Elizabeth Buckley', 'Kerri Beckmann', ""Michael O'Callaghan"", 'Martin Borg', 'Michala Short']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Radiother Oncol""","""['Radical radiotherapy for prostate cancer: patterns of care in Sweden 1998-2016.', 'Under-utilisation of high-dose-rate brachytherapy boost in men with intermediate-high risk prostate cancer treated with external beam radiotherapy.', 'Ten-year survival after High-Dose-Rate Brachytherapy combined with External Beam Radiation Therapy in high-risk prostate cancer: A comparison with the Norwegian SPCG-7 cohort.', 'Low-dose rate brachytherapy for men with localized prostate cancer.', 'A systematic review of randomised controlled trials of radiotherapy for localised prostate cancer.']"""

The DRE has a high variability as it is based manly in the tactile sensitivity and expertise of the examiner. The prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test was initially developed for surveillance of prostate cancer and later it was also used as a diagnosis test. Raman spectroscopy is a powerful analytical technique that can measure the chemical composition of complex biological samples, such as body fluids. Biochemical changes caused by diseases can lead to significant changes in the Raman spectra. This study aimed to identify the differences in the Raman spectra of serum samples with normal and altered PSA values and correlate these differences by using multivariate techniques (principal component analysis - PCA and partial least squares regression - PLS). A total of 321 spectra were collected from 108 subjects. Two hundred and seventy were obtained from 91 non-altered PSA samples and 51 spectra from 17 samples with altered PSA. Each spectrum acquired was standardized to the area under the curve (1-norm). Discriminating and quantitative models employing PCA and PLS were developed. The PCA analyses showed 85.7% predictive power (87.41% sensitivity and 76.47% specificity). The PLS test showed a near-perfect sensitivity (98.51%) and an intermediate specificity (62.75%). The quantitative model through PLS regression showed a good correlation between PSA values and the spectral features (r = 0.605). This preliminary study suggests that Raman spectroscopy could be efficiently used for screening patients with altered PSA as well as for follow-up of the treatment of the prostate cancer by using initially the PLS to identify the possible presence of the prostate cancer and later on use de PCA to confirm the diagnosis.""","""['Neandder A Correia', 'Lucas T A Batista', 'Roberto J M Nascimento', 'Maria C T Cangussú', 'Pedro J L Crugeira', 'Luiz G P Soares', 'Landulfo Silveira Jr', 'Antonio L B Pinheiro']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""J Photochem Photobiol B""","""['Spectral model for diagnosis of acute leukemias in whole blood and plasma through Raman spectroscopy.', 'Surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy of serum accurately detects prostate cancer in patients with prostate-specific antigen levels of 4-10 ng/mL.', 'Use of low free to total PSA ratio in prostate cancer screening: detection rates, clinical and pathological findings in Brazilian men with serum PSA levels <4.0 ng/mL.', 'Evaluation of prostate specific antigen density and transrectal ultrasonography-guided biopsies in 100 consecutive patients with a negative digital rectal examination and intermediate serum prostate specific antigen levels.', 'Prostate-specific antigen and the early diagnosis of prostate cancer.', 'Detecting Pre-Analytically Delayed Blood Samples for Laboratory Diagnostics Using Raman Spectroscopy.', 'Rapid label-free detection of cholangiocarcinoma from human serum using Raman spectroscopy.', 'Label-free discrimination of tumorigenesis stages using in vitro prostate cancer bone metastasis model by Raman imaging.', 'Human red blood cell behaviour in hydroxyethyl starch: probed by single cell spectroscopy.', 'Diagnosing COVID-19 in human sera with detected immunoglobulins IgM and IgG by means of Raman spectroscopy.']"""

Secondary Analysis of a Phase III Trial""","""Purpose:   Previously a phase III trial of a hydrogel rectal spacer during prostate radiation therapy found decreased toxicity and a clinically significant improvement in bowel quality of life (QOL) at 3 years by the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index. We performed a secondary analysis to identify men less likely to benefit.  Methods and materials:   Clinical and dosimetric data for the 222 patients enrolled on the SpaceOAR phase III trial were analyzed. The volume of rectum treated to 70 Gy (V70) and the quantitative analysis of normal tissue effects in the clinic (QUANTEC) rectal dose goals were used as surrogates for clinical benefit and plan quality. Mean bowel QOL was assessed at 15 and 36 months posttreatment and the likelihood of 1× (5 points) or 2× (10 points) minimally important difference changes were assessed.  Results:   Rectal V70 was correlated with physician scored toxicity (P = .033) and was used as a surrogate for plan quality. There was no correlation between prostate volume and rectal V70 (r = 0.077). Rectal V70 pre- and post-hydrogel was 13% and 3% for the smallest prostates (<40 mL) and 12% and 2% for the largest (>80 mL). The relative reduction in rectal V70 of 78% did not vary by prespacer V70, but the absolute reduction was greater for a higher V70. All spacer plans met the 5 QUANTEC rectal dose constraints, although 92% of control plans met all constraints. At 3 years, those not meeting all QUANTEC goals had a 15.0-point (standard deviation 15.1) decline, control patients meeting QUANTEC goals had a 4.0-point (9.5) decline, and spacer had >0.5 (7.6; P < .01). Previous surgery was not correlated with QOL (P = .8). Across prognostic groups, including age, body mass index, previous surgery, target volume, or quality of radiation plans, there was no statistically significant heterogeneity in the relative benefit of spacer in decreasing the risk of 1× or 2× the minimally important difference declines.  Conclusions:   There was little heterogeneity in the likelihood of spacer reducing the risk of declines in bowel QOL across clinical and dosimetric variables. Even for the >95% of plans meeting QUANTEC rectal criteria, hydrogel spacer provided potentially meaningful benefits.""","""['Thomas J Quinn', 'Stephanie Daignault-Newton', 'Walter Bosch', 'Neil Mariados', 'John Sylvester', 'Dhiren Shah', 'Eric Gross', 'Richard Hudes', 'David Beyer', 'Steven Kurtzman', 'Jeffrey Bogart', 'R Alex Hsi', 'Michael Kos', 'Rodney Ellis', 'Mark Logsdon', 'Shawn Zimberg', 'Kevin Forsythe', 'Hong Zhang', 'Edward Soffen', 'Patrick Francke', 'Constantine Mantz', 'Theodore DeWeese', 'Hiram A Gay', 'Jeff Michalski', 'Daniel A Hamstra']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Pract Radiat Oncol""","""['Hydrogel Spacer Prospective Multicenter Randomized Controlled Pivotal Trial: Dosimetric\xa0and Clinical Effects of Perirectal Spacer Application in Men Undergoing Prostate\xa0Image Guided Intensity Modulated Radiation\xa0Therapy.', 'A multi-institutional clinical trial of rectal dose reduction via injected polyethylene-glycol hydrogel during intensity modulated radiation therapy for prostate cancer: analysis of dosimetric outcomes.', 'Continued Benefit to Rectal Separation for Prostate Radiation Therapy: Final Results of\xa0a\xa0Phase III Trial.', 'Absorbable Hydrogel Spacer Use in Prostate Radiotherapy: A Comprehensive Review of Phase 3 Clinical Trial Published Data.', 'Dose-volume analysis of predictors for chronic rectal toxicity after treatment of prostate cancer with adaptive image-guided radiotherapy.', 'Rectal Cancer after Prostate Radiation: A Complex and Controversial Disease.', 'Application of Hydrogel Spacer SpaceOAR Vue for Prostate Radiotherapy.', 'Delphi study to identify consensus on patient selection for hydrogel rectal spacer use during radiation therapy for prostate cancer in the UK.', 'Rationale for Utilization of Hydrogel Rectal Spacers in Dose Escalated SBRT for the Treatment of Unfavorable Risk Prostate Cancer.', 'Endorectal balloon (ERB) in helical tomotherapy (HT) for localized prostate cancer: a case report of dosimetric analysis.']"""

However, the significance of ACAT-1 and cholesterol esters (CE) is relatively understudied in ovarian cancer. In this in vitro study, we assessed the expression and contribution of ACAT-1 in ovarian cancer progression. We observed a significant increase in the expression of ACAT-1 and CE levels in a panel of ovarian cancer cell lines (OC-314, SKOV-3 and IGROV-1) compared to primary ovarian epithelial cells (normal controls). To confirm the tumor promoting capacity of ACAT-1, we inhibited ACAT-1 expression and activity by treating our cell lines with an ACAT inhibitor, avasimibe, or by stable transfection with ACAT-1 specific short hairpin RNA (shRNA). We observed significant suppression of cell proliferation, migration and invasion in ACAT-1 knockdown ovarian cancer cell lines compared to their respective controls (cell lines transfected with scrambled shRNA). ACAT-1 inhibition enhanced apoptosis with a concurrent increase in caspases 3/7 activity and decreased mitochondrial membrane potential. Increased generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) coupled with increased expression of p53 may be the mechanism(s) underlying pro-apoptotic action of ACAT-1 inhibition. Additionally, ACAT-1 inhibited ovarian cancer cell lines displayed enhanced chemosensitivity to cisplatin treatment. These results suggest ACAT-1 may be a potential new target for the treatment of ovarian cancer.""","""['Vijayalakshmi N Ayyagari', 'Xinjia Wang', 'Paula L Diaz-Sylvester', 'Kathleen Groesch', 'Laurent Brard']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Acyl-coenzyme A: cholesterol acyltransferase inhibitor Avasimibe affect survival and proliferation of glioma tumor cell lines.', 'Regulation of ovarian cholesterol metabolism: control of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase and acyl coenzyme A:cholesterol acyltransferase.', 'Human acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT) and its potential as a target for pharmaceutical intervention against atherosclerosis.', 'Knockdown of ACAT-1 reduces amyloidogenic processing of APP.', 'Acyl-Coenzyme A: Cholesterol Acyltransferase Inhibition in Cancer Treatment.', 'Evaluation of sterol‑o‑acyl transferase 1 and cholesterol ester levels in plasma, peritoneal fluid and tumor tissue of patients with endometrial cancer: A pilot study.', 'Autophagy inhibition and reactive oxygen species elimination by acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase 1 through fused in sarcoma protein to promote prostate cancer.', 'Cholesterol: An important actor on the cancer immune scene.', 'TGF-β signaling in the tumor metabolic microenvironment and targeted therapies.', 'The Integration of Metabolomics with Other Omics: Insights into Understanding Prostate Cancer.']"""

This method could serve as an intraprocedural validation of the completion of tumor ablation, reducing the number of local recurrences after cryoablation procedures.  Materials and methods:   The method relies on the short T1 and T2* relaxation times of frozen soft tissue. Pointwise Encoding Time with Radial Acquisition, a 3-dimensional UTE sequence with TE = 70 microseconds, was optimized with STIR to null tissues with a T1 of approximately 271 milliseconds, the threshold T1. Because the T1 relaxation time of frozen tissue in the temperature range of -40°C < temperature < -8°C is shorter than the threshold T1 at the 3-tesla magnetic field, tissues in this range should appear hyperintense. The sequence was evaluated in ex vivo frozen tissue, where image intensity and actual tissue temperatures, measured by thermocouples, were correlated. Thereafter, the sequence was evaluated clinically in 12 MR-guided prostate cancer cryoablations, where MR-compatible cryoprobes were used to destroy cancerous tissue and preserve surrounding normal tissue.  Results:   The ex vivo experiment using a bovine muscle demonstrated that STIR-UTE images showed regions approximately between -40°C and -8°C as hyperintense, with tissues at lower and higher temperatures appearing dark, making it possible to identify the region likely to be above the lethal temperature inside the frozen tissue. In the clinical cases, the STIR-UTE images showed a dark volume centered on the cryoprobe shaft, Vinner, where the temperature is likely below -40°C, surrounded by a doughnut-shaped hyperintense volume, where the temperature is likely between -40°C and -8°C. The hyperintense region was itself surrounded by a dark volume, where the temperature is likely above -8°C, permitting calculation of Vouter. The STIR-UTE frozen-tissue volumes, Vinner and Vouter, appeared significantly smaller than signal voids on turbo spin echo images (P < 1.0 × 10), which are currently used to quantify the frozen-tissue volume (""the iceball""). The ratios of the Vinner and Vouter volumes to the iceball were 0.92 ± 0.08 and 0.29 ± 0.07, respectively. In a single postablation follow-up case, a strong correlation was seen between Vinner and the necrotic volume.

Methods:   Patients with prostate cancer who had fluciclovine PET and pelvic mpMRI between October 2017 and October 2018 in our center were retrospectively reviewed. Patients were included if they had fluciclovine PET/CT and mpMRI within a 3-month interval. Patients were excluded if they had separate concurrent cancer or if the PSA were more than 2-fold difference with an absolute difference more than 1 ng/mL between the 2 image studies. For each eligible patient, we compared all abnormal lesions identified on either scan. The findings were verified by pathology or other imaging techniques within minimal 10-month clinical follow-up.  Results:   A total of 129 patients with 129 paired tests were included in this study. Fluciclovine PET/CT and pelvic MRI had a high degree of concordance (121/129, 93.8%). The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value for fluciclovine PET/CT and mpMRI were 96.6%, 94.3%, 93.4%, and 97%, and 91.5%, 95.7%, 94.7%, and 93%, respectively. There were no statistical significant differences in diagnostic performance between the 2 imaging tests. Among the 8/129 discordant cases, although fluciclovine PET/CT provided definitive diagnosis when mpMRI was equivocal due to paramagnetic artifacts from fiducial markers and detected normal-sized regional lymph nodes, mpMRI detected subcentimeter periurethral recurrence and clarified physiological urinary artifacts that was not appreciated on fluciclovine PET/CT.  Conclusions:   Our single-center study demonstrated that fluciclovine PET/CT has similar diagnostic performance with pelvic mpMRI in detecting recurrent/metastatic prostate disease in the pelvis in the setting of rising PSA after initial treatment. Moreover, fluciclovine PET/CT and mpMRI have different implications in different clinical scenario; each test has its own limitation and pitfalls, but can be complementary to each other.""","""['Bo Chen', 'Tharakeswara K Bathala', 'Guofang Xu', 'Ajalaya Teyateeti', 'Brian F Chapin', 'Chad Tang', 'Shi-Ming Tu', 'Homer A Macapinlac', 'Yang Lu']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Clin Nucl Med""","""['More advantages in detecting bone and soft tissue metastases from prostate cancer using 18F-PSMA PET/CT.', 'Prospective evaluation of fluciclovine (18F) PET-CT and MRI in detection of recurrent prostate cancer in non-prostatectomy patients.', 'Prostate cancer recurrence in patients with negative or equivocal conventional imaging: A role for 18F-fluciclovine-PET/CT in delineating sites of recurrence and identifying patients with oligometastatic disease.', 'Fluorine-18-Labeled Fluciclovine PET/CT in Primary and Biochemical Recurrent Prostate Cancer Management.', 'A review discussing fluciclovine (18F) PET/CT imaging in the detection of recurrent prostate cancer.']"""

Prostate-specific membrane antigen expression is also demonstrated in the tumor-associated neovasculature endothelium. Juvenile nasal angiofibroma (JNA), being a similar highly vascular tumor, may also demonstrate significant PSMA expression, which may be utilized for its imaging and treatment.  Methods:   In this prospective study, 25 clinicoradiologically diagnosed primary JNA patients underwent PSMA PET/CT scan. The scan was performed after 45 to 60 minutes of intravenous injection of 2 to 3 mCi (74-111 MBq) of Ga-PSMA-HBED-CC on a dedicated PET/CT scanner. Low-dose CT scan was acquired from vertex to sternoclavicular joint (100 mA, 20 kVp, 3-mm slice thickness, 0.8 pitch). Images were reconstructed with iterative reconstruction technique (4 iterations, 24 subsets). The objective was to assess the intensity and pattern of PSMA uptake in primary JNA patients.  Results:   All cases (n = 25) of primary JNA showed PSMA expression in the tumor (100%). The median PSMA SUVmax ratio of tumor to background was 4.57 (range, 2.08-7.27). Intracranial extension in 14 of 25 patients was prominently visualized because of absence of background uptake in the brain. Advanced stage tumors demonstrated greater uptake than early tumors (P = 0.011). A statistically nonsignificant trend was noted for decreasing uptake with increasing age after normalizing for stage (Spearman correlation coefficient r = -0.08).  Conclusions:   Assessment of PSMA expression in JNA by PSMA PET/CT opens up a new window of opportunity with respect to its radiological staging, vascularity assessment, and molecular characterization.

Materials and methods:   We identified 975 patients who underwent radical prostatectomy with preoperative multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging between January 2013 and April 2019 at our institution. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed predicting pathological extraprostatic extension, high grade prostate cancer (final pathology GGG [Gleason Grade Group] 3 or greater) in the overall population and pathological upgrading (final pathology GGG 3 or greater) in patients with a diagnosis of GGG 1-2 prostate cancer. Adverse pathology was defined as pT3 and/or GGG 3 or greater.  Results:   A total of 221 (23%) patients were African American. Preoperatively 594 (60.9%) were GGG 1-2 (low risk group) and 381 (39.1%) GGG 3 or greater (high risk group). In the low risk group rates of pathological extraprostatic extension (18% vs 12.8%, p=0.14), adverse pathology (18% vs 13.4%, p=0.2) or upgrading (9.4% vs 12.1%, p=0.4) were similar between races. Similarly, in the high risk group there was no difference in rates of pathological extraprostatic extension. On multivariable analysis multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging predicted the presence of extraprostatic extension (OR 1.80, 95% CI 1.29-2.50) and high grade prostate cancer (OR 1.82, 95% CI 1.25-2.67) on final pathology. Conversely, race did not predict the outcomes of interest (all values p >0.05). Multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging showed comparable sensitivity (22.22% vs 27.84%), specificity (89.2% vs 79.2%), positive predictive value (89.2% vs 83.4%) and negative predictive value (89.2% vs 83.4%) between African American and Caucasian America men, respectively.  Conclusions:   The accuracy of multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging in staging prostate cancer was similar in African American and Caucasian American patients and no difference was found between races in pathological outcomes after radical prostatectomy.

Our purpose was to provide a benchmark for better understanding clinical trial enrollment feasibility and to assess relative levels of competition for patients by cancer diagnosis.  Methods:   The Database for Aggregate Analysis of ClinicalTrials.gov, up to date as of September 3, 2017, was used to identify actively recruiting, interventional oncology trials with US sites. Observational studies were excluded because not all are registered. Trials were categorized through Medical Subject Headings or free-text condition terms and sorted by cancer diagnosis. Trials that included more than one cancer diagnosis were included in the overall cohort but excluded when evaluating enrollment by cancer type. Trial enrollment slot availability was estimated between September 1, 2017, and August 31, 2018. Availability was estimated from total anticipated enrollment and duration, assuming a constant recruitment rate. Estimates for studies with both foreign and domestic sites were then prorated to calculate available enrollment in the United States alone. Ratios of the number of newly diagnosed patients in the United States available per trial slot were estimated using the American Cancer Society cancer incidence estimates for 2017.  Results:   A total of 4,598 interventional oncology trials were identified. Overall, the estimated ratio of newly diagnosed patients available per trial slot was 12.6. Estimated ratios of patients per trial slot for six cancer diagnoses with the highest potential of 12-month US enrollment were as follows: colorectal, 24.7; lung and bronchus, 20.1; prostate, 17.6; breast (female), 13.8; leukemia, 11.6; and brain and other nervous system, 6.0.  Conclusion:   For all cancers, successfully accruing trials currently open would require that more than one in every 13 recently diagnosed patients (7.9%) enroll.

However, the function of miR-195 and the underlying mechanisms in PCa remain unknown. Here, we report that a significant down-regulation of microRNA-195 (miR-195) in PCa tissues and cell lines was associated with promoter methylation status. Overexpression of miR-195 significantly suppressed cell proliferation, migration, invasion and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (increased E-cadherin and decreased N-cadherin) in PCa cells. We further demonstrated that transfection with a miR-195 inhibitor reversed the inhibitory effect of the DNA methyltransferase inhibitor 5-azacytidine on the proliferation, migration and invasion ability of PCa cells.

Payment reform to reduce unnecessary spending variation is an important strategy for reducing waste, but its magnitude and drivers within prostate cancer are unknown.  Methods:   In total, 38,971 men aged ≥66 years with localized prostate cancer who were enrolled in Medicare fee-for-service and were included in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-Medicare database from 2009 to 2014 were included. Multilevel linear regression with physician and facility random effects was used to examine the contributions of urologists, radiation oncologists, and their affiliated facilities to variation in total patient spending in the year after diagnosis within geographic region. The authors assessed whether spending variation was driven by patient characteristics, disease risk, or treatments. Physicians and facilities were sorted into quintiles of adjusted patient-level spending, and differences between those that were high-spending and low-spending were examined.  Results:   Substantial variation in spending was driven by physician and facility factors. Differences in cancer treatment modalities drove more variation across physicians than differences in patient and disease characteristics (72% vs 2% for urologists, 20% vs 18% for radiation oncologists). The highest spending physicians spent 46% more than the lowest and had more imaging tests, inpatient care, and radiotherapy spending. There were no differences across spending quintiles in the use of robotic surgery by urologists or the use of brachytherapy by radiation oncologists.  Conclusions:   Significant differences were observed for patients with similar demographics and disease characteristics. This variation across both physicians and facilities suggests that efforts to reduce unnecessary spending must address decision making at both levels.""","""['Danielle Rodin', 'Alyna T Chien', 'Chad Ellimoottil', 'Paul L Nguyen', 'Pragya Kakani', 'Matthew Mossanen', 'Meredith Rosenthal', 'Mary Beth Landrum', 'Anna D Sinaiko']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Cancer""","""['Variation in Physician Spending and Association With Patient Outcomes.', 'Analysis of Physician Variation in Provision of Low-Value Services.', 'Spending patterns in region of residency training and subsequent expenditures for care provided by practicing physicians for Medicare beneficiaries.', 'Issues in health care: interventional pain management at the crossroads.', ""For Medicare's New Approach To Physician Payment, Big Questions Remain."", 'Impact of Diagnosis-Related-Group (DRG) payment on variation in hospitalization expenditure: evidence from China.']"""

In aqueous solution (pH = 7), [Sc(pypa)]- presented two isomeric forms, the structures of which were predicted using density functional theory (DFT) calculation with a small energy difference of 22.4 kJ/mol, explaining their coexistence. [Sc(pypa)]- was found to have superior thermodynamic stability (pM = 27.1) compared to [Sc(AAZTA)]- (24.7) and [Sc(DOTA)]- (23.9). In radiolabeling, [44Sc][Sc(pypa)]- formed efficiently at RT in 15 min over a range of pH (2-5.5), resulting in a complex that is highly stable (>99%) in mouse serum over at least six half-lives of scandium-44.

It is of interest because of a possible prognostic role of differential expression in tumors and its role as a target for indatuximab, a monoclonal antibody coupled with a cytotoxic agent. To comprehensively analyze CD138 in normal and neoplastic tissues, we used tissue microarrays (TMAs) for analyzing immunohistochemically detectable CD138 expression in 2,518 tissue samples from 85 different tumor entities and 76 different normal tissue types. The data showed that CD138 expression is abundant in tumors. At least an occasional weak CD138 immunostaining could be detected in 71 of 82 (87%) different tumor types, and 58 entities (71%) had at least one tumor with a strong positivity. In normal tissues, a particularly strong expression was found in normal squamous epithelium of various organs, goblet and columnar cells of the gastrointestinal tract, and in hepatocytes. The highly standardized analysis of most human cancer types resulted in a ranking order of tumors according to the frequency and levels of CD138 expression. CD138 immunostaining was highest in squamous cell carcinomas such as from the esophagus (100%), cervix uteri (79.5%), lung (85.7%), vagina (89.7%) or vulva (73.3%), and in invasive urothelial cancer (76.2%). In adenocarcinomas, CD138 was also high in lung (82.9%) and colorectal cancer (85.3%) but often lower in pancreas (73.3%), stomach (54.2% in intestinal type), or prostate carcinomas (16.3%). CD138 expression was usually low or absent in germ cell tumors, sarcomas, endocrine tumors including thyroid cancer, and neuroendocrine tumors. In summary, the preferential expression in squamous cell carcinomas of various sites makes these cancers prime targets for anti-CD138 treatments once these might become available. Abundant expression in many different normal tissues might pose obstacles to exploiting CD138 as a therapeutic target, however.""","""['Simon Kind', 'Christina Merenkow', 'Franziska Büscheck', 'Katharina Möller', 'David Dum', 'Viktoria Chirico', 'Andreas M Luebke', 'Doris Höflmayer', 'Andrea Hinsch', 'Frank Jacobsen', 'Cosima Göbel', 'Sören Weidemann', 'Christoph Fraune', 'Christina Möller-Koop', 'Claudia Hube-Magg', 'Till S Clauditz', 'Ronald Simon', 'Guido Sauter', 'Waldemar Wilczak', 'Ahmed Abdulwahab Bawahab', 'Jakob R Izbicki', 'Daniel Perez', 'Andreas Marx']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Dis Markers""","""['Diagnostic and prognostic impact of cytokeratin 18 expression in human tumors: a tissue microarray study on 11,952 tumors.', 'A shift from membranous and stromal syndecan-1 (CD138) expression to cytoplasmic CD138 expression is associated with poor prognosis in breast cancer.', 'Increased Cytoplasmic CD138 Expression Is Associated with Aggressive Characteristics in Prostate Cancer and Is an Independent Predictor for Biochemical Recurrence.', 'CD138 (syndecan-1) expression in health and disease.', 'Molecular and clinical profiles of syndecan-1 in solid and hematological cancer for prognosis and precision medicine.', 'Syndecan‑1 expression is an independent favourable prognostic marker in oesophageal adenocarcinoma and represents a potential therapeutic target.', 'Heterogeneity and versatility of the extracellular matrix during the transition from pleomorphic adenoma to carcinoma ex pleomorphic adenoma: cumulative findings from basic research and new insights.', 'Expression of Syndecan-1 and Cyclin D1 in Salivary Gland Tumors in Relation to Clinicopathological Parameters.', 'CD138 Is Expressed in Different Entities of Salivary Gland Cancer and Their Lymph Node Metastases and Therefore Represents a Potential Therapeutic Target.', 'Nfkb2 deficiency and its impact on plasma cells and immunoglobulin expression in murine small intestinal mucosa.']"""

In this report, the link between hypoxia and miR-210 in prostate cancer cells is investigated. Polymerase chain reaction analysis demonstrates that miR-210 is induced by hypoxia in prostate cancer cells using in vitro cell models and an in vivo prostate tumour xenograft model. Analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas prostate biopsy datasets shows that miR-210 is significantly correlated with Gleason grade and other clinical markers of prostate cancer progression. Neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) is identified as a target of miR-210, providing a biological mechanism whereby hypoxia-induced miR-210 expression can contribute to prostate cancer.

Less is known regarding how geographical factors, including neighborhood social vulnerability and distance traveled to receive care, affect PrCA risk. The purpose of this research was to use the Veterans Administration Medical System, which provides a unique means for studying PrCA epidemiology among diverse individuals with ostensibly equal access to healthcare, to determine whether area-level characteristics influence PrCA incidence while accounting for individual-level risk factors.  Methods:   From the US Veteran's Health Administration (VHA) electronic medical records (EMR) database from January 1999 to December 2015, we identified 3,736 PrCA patients and 104,017 cancer-free controls from South Carolina (SC). The VHA EMRs were linked to the US census which provided area-level factors. US census data were used to construct the Social Vulnerability Index which is a continuous composite measure of area-level vulnerability and was divided into tertiles for modeling purposes. Data were analyzed using a Bayesian multivariate conditional autoregressive model (CAR) which accounted for individual-level factors, area-level factors, spatial random effects, and autocorrelation, which were used to identify areas of higher- or lower-than-expected PrCA incidence after controlling for risk factors.  Results:   As expected, after accounting for age (sixfold and 13-fold increases in men 40-50 years and > 50 years, respectively), race was an important risk factor, with threefold higher odds among Blacks in the fully adjusted model [ORadj 2.98 (2.77, 3.20)]. After accounting for all other factors, residing in a ZIP code tabulated areas (ZCTA) with the greatest level social vulnerability versus the lowest, least vulnerable ZCTA's, increased PrCA risk by 39% [ORadj 1.39 (1.11, 1.75)].  Conclusions:   While accounting for known risk factors for PrCA, including age, race, and marital status, we found geographic areas in SC characterized by higher than average social vulnerability with higher rates of incident PrCA among veterans.

Methods:   Forty men with surgical indication due to BPE and concomitantly elevated PSA levels were prospectively enrolled and retrospectively analysed. All patients underwent 1.5 Tesla mpMRI prior to TRUS-guided biopsies. In cases where mpMRI was PIRADS 3 with focal lesions, PIRADS 4 or PIRADS 5, additional fragments were obtained with the fusion guided technique. Biopsy histopathological results were used as the standard of reference. Two scenarios were evaluated: scenario 1, considering mpMRI PIRADS 1 and 2 as negative; and scenario 2, considering PIRADS 1, 2 and 3 as negative. Clinically significant prostate cancer (CsPCa) was defined as ISUP ≥ 2.  Results:   Median age was 68 years, median PSA was 9.41 (6.40-19.54) and median prostatic volume was 116.5 cc (IQR 86.5-155).

The important node genes identified were screened by integrated analysis. Gene expression microarrays and gene methylation microarrays were downloaded and aberrantly methylated‑differentially expressed genes were obtained. Enrichment analysis and protein‑protein interactions (PPI) were obtained, their interactive and visual networks were created, and the node genes in the PPI network were validated. A total of 105 hypomethylation‑high expression genes and 561 hypermethylation‑low expression genes along with their biological processes were identified. The top 10 node genes obtained from the PPI network were identified for each of the two gene groups. The methylation and gene expression status of node genes in TCGA database, GEPIA tool, and the HPA database were generally consistent with those of our results. In conclusion, the present study identified 20 aberrantly methylated‑differentially expressed genes in PCa by combining bioinformatics analyses of gene expression and gene methylation microarrays, and concurrently, the survival of these genes was analyzed. Notably, methylation is a reversible biological process, which makes it of great biological significance for the diagnosis and treatment of prostate cancer using bioinformatics technology to determine abnormal methylation gene markers.

Here, we identify a set of six cis-regulatory elements in the FOXA1 regulatory plexus harboring somatic single-nucleotide variants in primary prostate tumors. We find that deletion and repression of these cis-regulatory elements significantly decreases FOXA1 expression and prostate cancer cell growth. Six of the ten single-nucleotide variants mapping to FOXA1 regulatory plexus significantly alter the transactivation potential of cis-regulatory elements by modulating the binding of transcription factors.

Little is known about patient bother related to this condition, specifically, its prevalence and predictors.  Aim:   To ascertain the prevalence and predictors of patient bother associated with climacturia.  Methods:   Patients presenting for the evaluation of sexual dysfunction after RP at a single center were queried on various domains of sexual dysfunction. This included orgasmic dysfunction and sexual incontinence (including climacturia and arousal incontinence). Patients were specifically asked about the frequency and amount of climacturia. In addition, questions addressed patient bother and the perceived bother of their partners. Descriptive statistics were used for patient characteristics. A t-test was used for comparing the frequency of patient and partner bother, and the Pearson correlation test compared relationships between bother and predictors. Multivariable analysis was conducted to define predictors of climacturia-associated bother.  Main outcome measure:   The main outcome measures was the prevalence and predictors of climacturia-associated patient bother and perceived partner bother.  Results:   Climacturia was reported by 23% of 3,207 consecutive men analyzed. Bother of any degree was experienced by 45% of these patients, and 14% reported partner bother related to this condition. Patient bother was associated with perceived partner bother (P < .001) and inversely correlated with relationship duration (P < .001). The overall frequency and quantity of climacturia were also predictive (P < .001 for both). In the adjusted model, all of these factors remained significant.  Clinical implications:   Given the prevalence of this condition and the bother associated with it, this complication should be discussed with patients preoperatively.  Strength & limitations:   Strengths include a large study population and specific questions on climacturia-associated bother. Limitations include the fact that it is a single-center study and no direct partner questioning occurred.  Conclusion:   Climacturia and its associated bother are common after RP. The predictors of patient bother include perceived partner bother, shorter relationship duration, and increasing frequency and quantity of climacturia. Salter CA, Bach PV, Miranda E, et al.

In this study, we explored patients' perspectives on the potential barriers and benefits of outpatient RARP. Materials and Methods: We developed a multidimensional questionnaire to assess socioeconomic status, presence of caretaker at home, preferred transportation to the emergency room in case of chest pain or postsurgical complications, readiness for discharge at postanesthesia care unit (PACU), and potential barriers for discharge. In addition, patients were asked to provide an estimate of overnight hospitalization costs and their willingness to pay out-of-pocket expenses for their overnight stay. Patients who underwent RARP between August 1, 2018, and April 30, 2019, were asked to fill the questionnaire within the first week following their operation. Results: During our study, 157/292 (53.8%) of men undergoing RARP from a single high-volume robotic surgeon completed the survey. Patients who completed <80% of the survey (n = 5) were excluded from the final analysis. Thirty-seven (24.3%) patients felt that they would have been ready for discharge immediately from PACU, and 48 (31.6%) patients after extended recovery and before midnight. Only 17.8% (n = 27) of the patients claim that they experienced a medical intervention in the hospital that could not have been managed at home. The main barriers for same-day discharge were pain (55.9%, 80/143), catheter discomfort (44.7%, 64/143), insufficient education about catheter care (31.4%, 45/143), postoperative nausea and vomiting (15.3%, 22/143), and medical complications (13.2%, 19/143).

However, the associated cost of installation of robot as well as running costs may hamper its utilization. We sought to investigate and identify the drivers of cost at our institution and implement changes that could reduce costs. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the annual cost data of all RARPs performed by a single surgeon between April 1, 2017 and March 31, 2018. A cost analysis was performed investigating the variable costs associated with RARP: anesthesia related, operative time, and medical supplies. We then prospectively implemented a cost reduction plan that included reducing the number of robotic instruments used per surgery, surgical supplies, and changing the type of trocars. We also investigated whether these changes impacted cost as well as operative outcomes. Results: Forty retrospective procedures were compared with 32 prospective procedures after implementation of cost reduction plan. There were no differences in clinical characteristics. Cost savings per case were $705 for variable costs (95% CI $662, $748, p < 0.01): $36 for anesthesia related (95% CI $5, $67, p = 0.03), $198 for operative time (95% CI $145, $251, p < 0.01), and $471 for medical supplies (95% CI $438, $504, p < 0.01).

Compared to the largest cohort (older adults), there were significant differences (age group versus [vs.] older adults) in Caucasian race (senior adult 98% vs. 89%, p = 0.042), male sex (young adults: 22% vs. 43%, p < 0.001) (middle adults: 29% vs. 43%, p < 0.001), unilateral tumor (young adult: 70% vs. 86%, p < 0.001) (middle adult: 79% vs. 86%, p = 0.003) (senior adults: 96% vs. 86%, p = 0.045), and cancer origin in breast (young adults: 51% vs. 32%, p = 0.002) (middle adults: 44% vs 32%, p < 0.001), lung (young adults: 14% vs. 30%, p = 0.004), kidney (young adults: 0% vs. 5%, p = 0.043), prostate (middle adults: 1% vs. 4%, p = 0.001), gastrointestinal tract (senior adults: 8% vs. 2%, p = 0.028), and others (children: 100% vs. 4%, p < 0.001) (young adults: 10% vs. 4%, p = 0.044). Kaplan-Meier survival (children, young, middle, older, and senior adults) at 1 year was 33%, 48%, 60%, 62%, and 76% and at 5 years was 0%, 22%, 29%, 25%, and 40%, respectively, with no difference per age category. The mean overall survival was 17.2 months and children demonstrated hazard ratio (HR) for death at 1 year of 2.1 relative to older adults.  Conclusion:   Uveal metastasis is found in all age groups. Compared to older adults, primary cancer site was more often breast and less likely lung in young and middle adults. Other rare sites were more often seen in children. Survival outcomes at 1 and 5 years were most favorable for senior adults and least favorable for children.""","""['Carol L Shields', 'Luis A Acaba-Berrocal', 'Evan B Selzer', 'Eileen L Mayro', 'Jennifer H Newman', 'Kunal Malik', 'R Joel Welch', 'Jerry A Shields']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Retina""","""['Metastatic tumours to the eye.

Prompted by published transcriptome data showing upregulation of NKX3-1 mRNA expression in EWSR1-NFATC2 sarcoma, we explored the utility of NKX3-1 immunohistochemistry in sarcoma diagnosis. We applied NKX3-1 immunohistochemistry to 11 EWSR1-NFATC2 sarcomas and 168 mimics using whole tissue sections. All EWSR1-NFATC2 sarcomas consisted of uniform small round or ovoid cells, all except 1 showing at least focally the typical growth pattern of nests, cords, or trabeculae within a fibrous/myxoid background. A variable eosinophilic infiltrate was common. NKX3-1 was expressed in 9 of 11 (82%) EWSR1-NFATC2 sarcomas, often diffuse and of moderate or strong intensity. All 12 mesenchymal chondrosarcomas tested were also positive for NKX3-1, with over half showing diffuse staining and moderate or strong intensity. The positive staining was seen only in the primitive small round cell component, whereas the cartilaginous component was mostly negative. Although 1 of 30 osteosarcomas showed focal NKX3-1 positivity, all the remaining 155 cases tested, including 20 Ewing sarcomas, 20 myoepithelial tumors, 11 ossifying fibromyxoid tumors, and 1 FUS-NFATC2 sarcoma were negative for NKX3-1. Our study provides the first evidence that EWSR1-NFATC2 sarcoma and Ewing sarcoma could be distinguished immunohistochemically, adding to the accumulating data that these tumors are phenotypically distinct. We suggest that NKX3-1 may have a diagnostic utility in the evaluation of sarcoma and we also call attention to potential pitfalls in the use of this well-known marker of prostatic adenocarcinoma.""","""['Ken-Ichi Yoshida', 'Isidro Machado', 'Toru Motoi', 'Antonina Parafioriti', 'Maribel Lacambra', 'Hitoshi Ichikawa', 'Akira Kawai', 'Cristina R Antonescu', 'Akihiko Yoshida']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Am J Surg Pathol""","""['Confirmation of NKX3-1 Expression in EWSR1-NFATC2 Sarcoma and Mesenchymal Chondrosarcoma Using Monoclonal Antibody Immunohistochemistry, RT-PCR, and RNA In Situ Hybridization.', 'NKX3.1 a useful marker for mesenchymal chondrosarcoma: An immunohistochemical study.', 'DNA methylation profiling distinguishes Ewing-like sarcoma with EWSR1-NFATc2 fusion from Ewing sarcoma.', 'Evaluation of NKX2-2 expression in round cell sarcomas and other tumors with EWSR1 rearrangement: imperfect specificity for Ewing sarcoma.', 'EWSR1/FUS-NFATc2 rearranged round cell sarcoma: clinicopathological series of 4 cases and literature review.', 'Ewing sarcoma and Ewing-like tumors.', 'Novel characteristics for immunophenotype, FISH pattern and molecular cytogenetics in synovial sarcoma.', 'The Recent Advances in Molecular Diagnosis of Soft Tissue Tumors.', 'NKX3.1 Expression and Molecular Characterization of Secretory Myoepithelial Carcinoma (SMCA): Advancing the Case for a Salivary Mucous Acinar Phenotype.', 'Biology and Management of High-Grade Chondrosarcoma: An Update on Targets and Treatment Options.', 'Ewing and Ewing-like sarcomas: A morphological guide through genetically-defined entities.']"""

Prostate cancers that harbor certain homologous recombination (HR) DNA repair gene mutations, inactivating CDK12 mutations or have underlying mismatch repair deficiency may be effectively treated with immunotherapy. Combination therapy may improve clinical response rates to immune checkpoint blockade. We observed profound prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and/or objective responses to immune checkpoint blockade following prior treatment with bipolar androgen therapy (BAT) and enzalutamide.  Methods:   We report three cases of patients with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) undergoing therapy with anti-PD-1 inhibitors. All patients underwent both somatic molecular testing and germline genetic testing.  Results:   Two of the three patients with mCRPC harbored an inactivating mutation in an HR DNA repair gene (BRCA2, ATM). No patient demonstrated mismatch repair deficiency, nor were CDK12 alterations present. All three patients had been treated with BAT and enzalutamide before immune checkpoint blockade, a paradoxical approach for the treatment of mCRPC developed by our group.

This amplifies the effect geometric uncertainties have on normal tissue dose. The aim of this study was to determine whether the treatment dose-volume histogram (DVH) agrees with the planned dose to organs at risk (OAR).  Methods:   41 low-intermediate risk prostate cancer patients were treated with SABR using a linac based technique. Dose prescribed was 35 Gy in five fractions delivered on alternate days, planned using volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) with 10X flattening filter free (FFF). On treatment, prostate was matched to fiducial markers on cone beam CT (CBCT). OAR were retrospectively delineated on 205 pre-treatment CBCT images. Daily CBCT contours were overlaid on the planning CT for dosimetric analysis. Verification plan used to evaluate the daily DVH for each structure. The daily doses received by OAR were recorded using the D%.  Results:   The median rectum and bladder volumes at planning were 67.1 cm3 (interquartile range 56.4-78.2) and 164.4 cm3 (interquartile range 120.3-213.4) respectively. There was no statistically significant difference in median rectal volume at each of the five treatment scans compared to the planning scan (p = 0.99). This was also the case for median bladder volume (p = 0.79). The median dose received by rectum and bladder at each fraction was higher than planned, at the majority of dose levels. For rectum the increase ranged from 0.78-1.64Gy and for bladder 0.14-1.07Gy. The percentage of patients failing for rectum D35% < 18 Gy (p = 0.016), D10% < 28 Gy (p = 0.004), D5% < 32 Gy (p = 0.0001), D1% < 35 Gy (p = 0.0001) and bladder D1% < 35 Gy (p = 0.001) at treatment were all statistically significant.  Conclusion:   In this cohort of prostate SABR patients, we estimate the OAR treatment DVH was higher than planned. This was due to rectal and bladder organ variation.

The weekly numbers of total prostate MRIs and AS cases recorded 15 months before and after the change (Groups 1 and 2, respectively). An intergroup variation in the weekly scan numbers was assessed using the coefficient of variance (CV) and mean absolute deviation; the Mann-Whitney U test was used for an intergroup comparison of the latter.  Results:   In AS patients, a shift from considerable to moderate variation in weekly scan numbers was observed between the two groups (CV, 51.7 and 26.8%, respectively); mean absolute deviation of AS scans also demonstrated a significant decrease in Group 2 (1.28 vs 2.58 in Group 1; p < 0.001).

Although existing literatures have revealed the oncogenic role of lncRNA homeobox A11 antisense RNA (HOXA11-AS) in multiple cancers, the underlying role of HOXA11-AS in prostate cancer (PCa) and its potential molecular mechanism remains poorly understood.  Aim:   To decipher the molecular performance of HOXA11-AS in PCa.  Methods:   The expression of HOXA11-AS, miR-518b and actinin alpha 4 (ACTN4) was detected by a real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Colony formation, EdU, flow cytometry, wound healing, and transwell assays were utilized to explore the biological role of HOXA11-AS in PCa. The interaction between RNAs (CCCTC-binding factor [CTCF], HOXA11-AS, miR-518b, and ACTN4) was tested via chromatin immunoprecipitation, luciferase reporter and RNA immunoprecipitation assays.  Results:   HOXA11-AS in PCa cells was expressed at high levels. Silenced HOXA11-AS in PCa cells could lead to a significant elevation in the abilities of cell proliferation and migration whereas a remarkable declination in cell apoptosis capability. Subsequent molecular mechanism assays confirmed that HOXA11-AS bound with miR-518b and negatively regulates miR-518b expression. Besides, HOXA11-AS could regulate the expression of ACTN4 by sponging miR-518b. Moreover, rescued-function assays revealed that miR-518b inhibition or ACTN4 upregulation reversed the repressive effect of HOXA11-AS knockdown on PCa progression. Furthermore, CTCF was validated to activate HOXA11-AS transcription in PCa cells.

In this study we overcome these limitations by using multivariable regression analysis.  Materials and methods:   Patients undergoing robot-assisted radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer at 4 institutions from 2013 to 2018 were included in the study. A multilevel logistic random intercept model, including covariates on patient level and side specific factors on prostate lobe level, was used to evaluate the association between nerve sparing and risk of ipsilateral positive margins.  Results:   A total of 5,148 prostate lobes derived from 2,574 patients who underwent robot-assisted radical prostatectomy were analyzed. Multivariable analysis showed nerve sparing was an independent predictor for ipsilateral positive margins (OR 1.42, 95% CI 1.14-1.82). Other significant predictors for positive margins were prostate specific antigen density (OR 3.64, 95% CI 2.36-5.90) and side specific covariates including highest preoperative ISUP (International Society of Urological Pathology) biopsy grade (OR 1.58, 95% CI 1.13-2.53; OR 1.62, 95% CI 1.13-2.69; OR 2.11, 95% CI 1.39-3.59 and OR 4.43, 95% CI 3.17-10.12 for ISUP grade 2, 3, 4 and 5, respectively), presence of extraprostatic extension on magnetic resonance imaging (OR 1.42, 95% CI 1.03-1.91) and percentage of positive cores on systematic biopsy (OR 3.82, 95% CI 2.50-5.86).

After one focal HIFU treatment, the mean change in IPSS was -0.03 (P = 0.02) and in IIEF (EF score) it was -0.4 (P = 0.02) at 1-2 years, with no subsequent decline. Absolute rates of erectile dysfunction increased from 9.9% to 20.8% (P = 0.08), leak-free continence decreased from 77.9% to 72.8% (P = 0.06) and pad-free continence from 98.6% to 94.8% (P = 0.07) at 1-2 years, respectively. IPSS prior to second focal HIFU treatment compared to baseline IPSS prior to first focal HIFU treatment was lower by -1.3 (P = 0.02), but mean IPSS change was +1.4 at 1-2 years (P = 0.03) and +1.2 at 2-3 years (P = 0.003) after the second focal HIFU treatment. The mean change in EF score after the second focal HIFU treatment was -0.2 at 1-2 years (P = 0.60) and -0.5 at 2-3 years (P = 0.10), with 17.8% and 6.2% of men with new erectile dysfunction. The rate of new pad use was 1.8% at 1-2 years and 2.6% at 2-3 years.  Conclusion:   A second focal HIFU procedure causes minor detrimental effects on urinary function and EF.

The use of computer-assisted diagnosis (CAD) may resolve this problem. We investigated the performance of a CAD system, BONENAVI, in the diagnosis of disseminated skeletal metastasis.  Methods:   Cases of disseminated skeletal metastasis were selected from a BS log. These patients' BSs were analyzed by BONENAVI to obtain an artificial neural network (ANN) and bone scan index (BSI). Clinical features (type of primary cancer, CT type, and BS type) were compared with the BONENAVI (ANN and BSI) results. The BS findings (diffuse increased axial skeleton uptake, inhomogeneity of uptake, proximal extremity contrast, and degree of renal uptake) and ANN or BSI were evaluated. Then, negative ANN patients were presented.  Results:   Fifty-four patients were diagnosed as having disseminated skeletal metastasis. Regarding the primary cancers, 12 had prostate cancer, 16 gastric cancers, 16 breast cancers, and 10 miscellaneous cancers. Total sensitivity of ANN (≥ 0.5) was 76% (41/54). ANN values correlated with the BS type among clinical features. Diffuse increased axial skeleton uptake was mostly correlated with ANN of the BS findings.  Conclusion:   The BONENAVI CAD system was partially helpful in diagnosing disseminated skeletal metastasis, but the sensitivity of BONENAVI was not sufficient and underestimated the disseminated skeletal metastasis.

Dual-bromodomain BET inhibitors (DbBi) that bind with similar affinities to the first (BD1) and second (BD2) bromodomains of BRD2, BRD3, BRD4 and BRDt have displayed modest clinical activity in monotherapy cancer trials. A reduced number of thrombocytes in the blood (thrombocytopenia) as well as symptoms of gastrointestinal toxicity are dose-limiting adverse events for some types of DbBi1-5. Given that similar haematological and gastrointestinal defects were observed after genetic silencing of Brd4 in mice6, the platelet and gastrointestinal toxicities may represent on-target activities associated with BET inhibition. The two individual bromodomains in BET family proteins may have distinct functions7-9 and different cellular phenotypes after pharmacological inhibition of one or both bromodomains have been reported10,11, suggesting that selectively targeting one of the bromodomains may result in a different efficacy and tolerability profile compared with DbBi. Available compounds that are selective to individual domains lack sufficient potency and the pharmacokinetics properties that are required for in vivo efficacy and tolerability assessment10-13. Here we carried out a medicinal chemistry campaign that led to the discovery of ABBV-744, a highly potent and selective inhibitor of the BD2 domain of BET family proteins with drug-like properties. In contrast to the broad range of cell growth inhibition induced by DbBi, the antiproliferative activity of ABBV-744 was largely, but not exclusively, restricted to cell lines of acute myeloid leukaemia and prostate cancer that expressed the full-length androgen receptor (AR). ABBV-744 retained robust activity in prostate cancer xenografts, and showed fewer platelet and gastrointestinal toxicities than the DbBi ABBV-07514. Analyses of RNA expression and chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing revealed that ABBV-744 displaced BRD4 from AR-containing super-enhancers and inhibited AR-dependent transcription, with less impact on global transcription compared with ABBV-075.

Here we characterize prostate cancer genomic alterations in the largest cohort to date of AA men with clinical follow-up for metastasis, with the aim to elucidate the key molecular drivers associated with poor prognosis in this population.  Experimental design:   Targeted sequencing was retrospectively performed on 205 prostate tumors from AA men treated with radical prostatectomy (RP) to examine somatic genomic alterations and percent of the genome with copy-number alterations (PGA). Cox proportional hazards analyses assessed the association of genomic alterations with risk of metastasis.  Results:   At RP, 71% (145/205) of patients had grade group ≥3 disease, and 49% (99/202) were non-organ confined. The median PGA was 3.7% (IQR = 0.9%-9.4%) and differed by pathologic grade (P < 0.001) and stage (P = 0.02). Median follow-up was 5 years. AA men with the highest quartile of PGA had increased risks of metastasis (multivariable: HR = 13.45; 95% CI, 2.55-70.86; P = 0.002). The most common somatic mutations were SPOP (11.2%), FOXA1 (8.3%), and TP53 (3.9%). The most common loci altered at the copy number level were CDKN1B (6.3%), CHD1 (4.4%), and PTEN (3.4%).

The spop gene is the most commonly point mutated in human primary prostate cancers, but the pathological contribution of the SPOP mutations remains unclear. In this study, we investigated several known factors that are critical in the DNA--protein cross-link repair process. The depletion of SPOP or overexpression of a prostate cancer-associated SPOP mutant, F133V, in androgen receptor-positive prostate cancer cells increased the amount of topoisomerase 2A (TOP2A) in the nuclei together with the increased amount of γH2AX, an indication of DNA breaks. Tyrosyl-DNA phosphodiesterases (TDPs) and an endo/exonuclease MRE11 are enzymes that liberate TOP2A from the TOP2A-DNA cleavage complex, and thus is essential for the completion of the DNA repair process. We found that the amount of TDP1 and TDP2 was decreased in SPOP-depleted cells, and that of TDP2 and MRE11 was decreased in F133V-overexpressing cells. These results suggest that the F133V mutant exerts dominant-negative and gain-of-function effects in down-regulation of TDP2 and MRE11, respectively. We conclude that SPOP is involved in the DNA-protein cross-link repair process through the elimination of TOP2A from the TOP2A cleavage complex, which may contribute to the genome stability.""","""['Ryuta Watanabe', 'Masashi Maekawa', 'Miki Hieda', 'Tomohiko Taguchi', 'Noriyoshi Miura', 'Tadahiko Kikugawa', 'Takashi Saika', 'Shigeki Higashiyama']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Mol Biol Cell""","""['The Roles of SPOP in DNA Damage Response and DNA Replication.', 'Depletion of tyrosyl DNA phosphodiesterase 2 activity enhances etoposide-mediated double-strand break formation and cell killing.', 'CHD1 and SPOP synergistically protect prostate epithelial cells from DNA damage.', 'Mutated SPOP E3 Ligase Promotes 17βHSD4 Protein Degradation to Drive Androgenesis and Prostate Cancer Progression.', 'Untangling trapped topoisomerases with tyrosyl-DNA phosphodiesterases.', 'Spatial Gene Expression Analysis Reveals Characteristic Gene Expression Patterns of De Novo Neuroendocrine Prostate Cancer Coexisting with Androgen Receptor Pathway Prostate Cancer.', 'Systematic Analysis of Cellular Signaling Pathways and Therapeutic Targets for SLC45A3:ERG Fusion-Positive Prostate Cancer.', 'CNKSR1 serves as a scaffold to activate an EGFR phosphatase via exclusive interaction with RhoB-GTP.', 'The Roles of SPOP in DNA Damage Response and DNA Replication.']"""

Materials and methods:   A discrete choice experiment tool was used to elicit patient preferences for different treatment characteristics in 34 urology departments. Patients with localized prostate cancer completed the discrete choice experiment within 1 week of being diagnosed and before they made treatment decisions. The discrete choice experiment was pretested (5) and piloted (106) with patients. Patients chose their preferred treatment profile based on the 6 characteristics of treatment type (active surveillance, focal therapy, radical therapy), return to normal activities, erectile function, urinary function, not needing more cancer treatment and 10 to 15-year cancer specific survival. Different tools were designed for patients with low-intermediate (468) and high risk (166) disease. An error components conditional logit model was used to estimate preferences and trade-offs between treatment characteristics.  Results:   Patients with low-intermediate risk disease were willing to trade 6.99% absolute decrease in survival to have active surveillance over definitive therapy. They were willing to trade 0.75%, 0.46% and 0.19% absolute decrease in survival for a 1-month reduction in time to return to normal activities and 1% absolute improvements in urinary and sexual function, respectively. Patients with high risk disease were willing to trade 3.10%, 1.04% and 0.41% absolute decrease in survival for a 1-month reduction in time to return to normal activities and 1% absolute improvements in urinary and sexual function, respectively.

Recent studies have shown that they exhibit antitumor properties in some tumors. We previously found that a GLP-1 analog, exendin-4 (Ex-4), inhibited the growth of prostate cancer cells through suppressing the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway, which is activated in response to enzalutamide treatment and reported to be closely related to resistance to enzalutamide. So we speculated that exendin-4 may enhance the sensitivity of prostate cancer to enzalutamide through inhibiting Akt activation.  Methods:   LNCap and CWR22RV1 cell lines, as well as mice bearing xenografts formed from the two cells, were used.  Results:   Exendin-4 in combination with enzalutamide dramatically suppressed tumor growth of prostate cancer cells compared to enzalutamide alone; exendin-4 is capable of antagonizing enzalutamide-induced invasion and migration of both prostate cancer cells (P < .05). Furthermore, the combination treatment significantly reduced Akt and mTOR levels that were triggered by enzalutamide administration, caused a further decrease in nuclear AR localization compared with the enzalutamide as a monotherapy (P < .5), though exendin-4 treatment alone showed no effect on nuclear AR.  Conclusion:   Our study demonstrated that exendin-4 alleviated resistance to enzalutamide, and suggested that exendin-4 combined with enzalutamide may be a more efficacious treatment for patients with advanced prostate cancer.""","""['He Wenjing', 'Yuanyuan Shao', 'Yi Yu', 'Wei Huang', 'Guoliang Feng', 'Junhe Li']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Inhibition of noncanonical Wnt pathway overcomes enzalutamide resistance in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Exendin-4 enhances radiation response of prostate cancer.', 'Combination AZD5363 with Enzalutamide Significantly Delays Enzalutamide-resistant Prostate Cancer in Preclinical Models.', 'Combination of sorafenib and enzalutamide as a potential new approach for the treatment of castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Enzalutamide: a new agent for the prostate cancer treatment armamentarium.', 'How Far beyond Diabetes Can the Benefits of Glucagon-like Peptide-1 Receptor Agonists Go?

Here we present an excepcional case of disseminated cryptococcosis with pulmonary and cerebral involvement in an immunocompetent patient with no apparent predisposing factors at the time of hospital admission. We described a case of an apparently immunocompetent 66-years old man admitted to hospital with a one-month history of cough, fever and vertigo. During hospitalization, thorax imaging was suggestive of lung metastasis, therefore, he went through several investigations. During hospitalization, he developed neurological symptoms and subsequently underwent a lumbar puncture. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) culture was positive for Cryptococcus spp. isolated on Sabouraud's dextrose agar and bird seed agar. In addition, the direct microscopy examination was positive for the India ink test, as well as with the latex agglutination test for cryptococcal polysaccharide antigen (CrAg) in CSF, while serum CrAg was negative. Despite the absence of classic immunocompromising features, he was treated with amphotericin B and fluconazole due to suspected disseminated cryptococcal infection. Later, he was diagnosed with prostatic adenocarcinoma. Upon successful completion of treatment for disseminated cryptococcosis, the patient underwent radical prostate ablation surgery as a treatment forprostatic adenocarcinoma. This exceptional case emphasizes the high degree of suspicion of atypical infections, and in these cases, it is particularly important to consider fungal infections in hitherto healthy patients with no apparent predisposing factors.

After thematic analysis, 11 categories emerged: 'Surprised by the abrupt disclosure of the diagnosis', 'Displeased by the direct disclosure of the diagnosis to the patient in the absence of family members', 'Unable to accept the doctor's negative words in the explanations', 'Unable to understand the doctor's technical jargon', 'Distrust due to failure in diagnosis based on previous examinations', 'Aggrieved at the doctor's unwillingness to allow questions', 'Dissatisfied with explanations involving facts only', 'Indignant over the unexpected disclosure of life expectancy', 'Unable to accept the doctor's blame for the delay in the initial hospital visit', 'Uncomfortable with the usage of inappropriate metaphors' and 'Pessimistic thoughts despite optimistic explanations'.  Conclusions:   It is clear that patients have recollections of a variety of negative experiences regarding the words/attitudes of their doctors at the time they received their prostate cancer diagnosis. Thus, the use of narrative data would facilitate the appropriate application of commonly used guidelines for the delivery of cancer diagnoses tailored to individual patients in clinical practice.""","""['Masako Torishima', 'Michiko Urao', 'Takeo Nakayama', 'Shinji Kosugi']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""BMJ Open""","""['Disclosures of illness by doctors to their patients: a qualitative study of doctors with HIV and other serious disorders.', 'The choice is yours?

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of tissue heterogeneities for these five high- to intermediate-energy sources in prostate and head & neck brachytherapy.  Methods and materials:   Treatment plans were generated for a cohort of prostate (n = 10) and oral tongue (n = 10) patients. Dose calculations were performed using RapidBrachyMCTPS, an in-house Geant4-based Monte Carlo treatment planning system. Treatment plans were simulated using 60Co, 192Ir, 75Se, 169Yb, and 153Gd as the active core of the microSelectron v2 source. Two dose calculation scenarios were presented: (1) dose to water in water (Dw,w), and (2) dose to medium in medium (Dm,m).  Results:   Dw,w overestimates planning target volume coverage compared with Dm,m, regardless of photon energy. The average planning target volume D90 reduction was ∼1% for high-energy sources, whereas larger differences were observed for intermediate-energy sources (1%-2% for prostate and 4%-7% for oral tongue). Dose differences were not clinically relevant (<5%) for soft tissues in general. Going from Dw,w to Dm,m, bone doses were increased two- to three-fold for 169Yb and four- to five-fold for 153Gd, whereas the ratio was close to ∼1 for high-energy sources.  Conclusions:   Dw,w underestimates the dose to bones and, to a lesser extent, overestimates the dose to soft tissues for radionuclides with average energies lower than 192Ir. Further studies regarding bone toxicities are needed before intermediate-energy sources can be adopted in cases where bones are in close vicinity to the tumor.""","""['Gabriel Famulari', 'Joanne Alfieri', 'Marie Duclos', 'Té Vuong', 'Shirin A Enger']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Brachytherapy""","""['On the impact of absorbed dose specification, tissue heterogeneities, and applicator heterogeneities on Monte Carlo-based dosimetry of Ir-192, Se-75, and Yb-169 in conventional and intensity-modulated brachytherapy for the treatment of cervical cancer.', 'Microdosimetric Evaluation of Current and Alternative Brachytherapy Sources-A Geant4-DNA Simulation Study.', 'Comparison of high-dose rate prostate brachytherapy dose distributions with iridium-192, ytterbium-169, and thulium-170 sources.', 'Prostate brachytherapy.

Methods:   This is a retrospective study of 18 consecutively treated HDR prostate brachytherapy patients treated between May 2018 to November 2018. Nine patients underwent HDR brachytherapy combined with external beam radiation therapy, and nine underwent HDR brachytherapy as monotherapy. Additional DVH values were extracted for the whole, proximal, middle, and distal urethra and compared for differences.  Results:   None of the ABS suggested constraints were violated when optimizing the urethra D0.1 cm3 dose to be less than 110% of the prescription. An evaluation of the DVHs for the whole, proximal, middle, and distal urethra showed a large variation in the shape of the remainder of the DVH for all parts of the urethra. The largest standard deviations in dose to the whole and middle urethra were at the V14 dose level, and that to the proximal and distal urethra were at the V10 dose level.  Conclusion:   A single urethral dose constraint of D0.1 cm3 < 110% can meet all the proposed ABS constraints.

Methods Semi-structured interviews were conducted with a purposive convenience sample of 40 Western Australian cancer patients diagnosed with breast, lung, prostate or colorectal cancer. Participants were asked about the impact of their diagnosis, the associated costs and their experience within the health system. Data were analysed using thematic content analysis. Results Three key themes influencing participant OOPE experiences were identified: (1) personal circumstances; (2) communication with health providers; and (3) coping strategies. Despite Australia's public healthcare system, several participants found the costs affected their financial security and resorted to coping strategies including medication rationing and restrictive household budgeting. The key themes had a complex and interrelated effect on patient OOPE experiences and were used to adapt Carrera et al.'s model of economic consequences of cancer treatment on the patient and patient coping to describe these relationships in a mixed healthcare system. Conclusion Organised efforts must be implemented to mitigate maladaptive coping strategies being used by cancer patients: (1) health providers should seek informed financial consent from patients before commencing treatment; and (2) financial aid and support schemes for cancer patients should be reviewed to ensure they are delivered equitably. What is known on this topic? The financial cost of cancer can have significant adverse effects on cancer patients. Although financial transparency is desired by cancer patients, its implementation in practice is not clear. What does this paper add? This study adapts a conceptual model for the economic consequences of a cancer diagnosis and repurposes it for a mixed public-private health system, providing a framework for understanding downstream consequences of cancer costs and highlighting opportunities for intervention. What are the implications for health practitioners? Health practitioners need to initiate discussions concerning treatment costs earlier with cancer patients. There are several resources and guides available to assist and facilitate financial transparency. Without urgent attention to the financial consequences of cancer treatment and related expenses, we continue to leave patients at risk of resorting to maladaptive coping strategies, such as medication rationing and restrictive household budgeting.""","""['Jade C Newton', 'Harry Hohnen', 'Claire E Johnson', 'Angela Ives', 'Sandy McKiernan', 'Violet Platt', 'Christobel Saunders', 'Neli Slavova-Azmanova']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Aust Health Rev""","""['A cross-sectional analysis of out-of-pocket expenses for people living with a cancer in rural and outer metropolitan Western Australia.', 'How communication between cancer patients and their specialists affect the quality and cost of cancer care.', ""'Biggest factors in having cancer were costs and no entitlement to compensation'-The determinants of out-of-pocket costs for cancer care through the lenses of rural and outer metropolitan Western Australians."", 'The direct and indirect financial costs of informal cancer care: A scoping review.', 'Financial toxicity in cancer care: Prevalence, causes, consequences, and reduction strategies.', ""Developing a Conceptual Framework for Socioeconomic Impact Research in European Cancer Patients: A 'Best-Fit' Framework Synthesis."", ""Patients' Perspectives on Access to Dialysis and Kidney Transplantation in Rural Communities in Australia.""]"""

The greatest concern about the ""extreme"" bladder neck preservation is the potential risk of creating a positive surgical margin at the level of bladder neck.  Materials and methods:   We prospectively collected data from 88 patients with diagnosed prostate cancer who underwent robotic radical prostatectomy with ""'extreme' bladder neck preservation."" All surgical procedures were performed by the same expert surgeon (F.D.M.). In this study, ""'extreme' bladder neck preservation"" was considered when the length of the spared intraprostatic segment of bladder neck was ⩾1 cm. We compared the histopathologic data with those of a homogeneous similar cohort of 88 consecutive patients who underwent robotic radical prostatectomy without bladder neck preservation.  Results:   The two groups analyzed were comparable according to clinical and pathological characteristics. A positive surgical margin at the level of bladder neck was found in five (5.7%) cases in the ""extreme"" bladder neck preservation group and in six cases (6.8%) in the no-bladder neck preservation group. The prostatic base was involved by neoplasia in 14 and 19 patients (15.9% and 21.6%, respectively); of these, five (35.7%) and six (31.6%) had positive surgical margin at the level of bladder neck, respectively. The pathological staging in positive surgical margin at the level of bladder neck patients was pT3 in five (100%) cases in the ""extreme"" bladder neck preservation group and in four (66.7%) cases when we decided not to preserve the bladder neck.  Conclusion:   We demonstrated that ""extreme"" bladder neck preservation is a safe oncological procedure with similar pathologic findings of a comparable no-bladder neck preservation series. Positive surgical margins at the level of bladder neck are linked to neoplasia with adverse pathological features, rather than the ""extreme"" bladder neck preservation procedure.""","""['Fabrizio Dal Moro', 'Michele Zazzara', 'Alessandro Morlacco', 'Marina Paola Gardiman', 'Giovanni Costa', 'Fabio Zattoni']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Urologia""","""['Systematic Review of Studies Reporting Positive Surgical Margins After Bladder Neck Sparing Radical Prostatectomy.', 'Prognostic differences among the positive surgical margin locations following robot-assisted radical prostatectomy in a large Japanese cohort (the MSUG94 group).', 'Oncologic outcomes of patients with incidental prostate cancer who underwent RARC: a comparison between nerve sparing and non-nerve sparing approach.', 'Minimally Invasive Radical Prostatectomy after Previous Bladder Outlet Surgery: A Systematic Review and Pooled Analysis of Comparative Studies.', 'Review of optimal techniques for robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy.']"""

Cisplatin is commonly used as a chemotherapeutic agent against advanced cancers, and is now used in metastatic prostate cancers. Cisplatin exerts its cytotoxic effects by cross-linking genomic DNA (gDNA) which induces DNA damage on rapidly dividing cancer cells. However, cisplatin leads to systemic side effects and some patients never respond. Our previous report demonstrated an oncogenic role of miR-181a in human prostate cancer. In this study, we investigate the mechanistic potential of miR-181a in regulating cisplatin sensitivity in this context. We report that cisplatin treatment significantly enhanced miR-181a expression and that exogenous overexpression of miR-181a decreased sensitivity of prostate cancer cells to cisplatin. Additionally, we observed that cisplatin-resistant prostate cancer cells harbored high levels of miR-181a expression. Mechanistically, we demonstrate the pro-apoptotic protein, BAX, is typically enhanced by cisplatin treatment but its suppression promoted resistance. Here we demonstrate miR-181a regulation of BAX was mediated through a complimentary interaction with the 3'UTR of the BAX transcript. We subsequently show that BAX expression restored cisplatin sensitivity in miR-181a overexpressing prostate cancer cells. In parallel, we demonstrate inhibition of miR-181a restored BAX expression as well as cisplatin sensitivity in resistant cells. This study suggests that miR-181a is a potential therapeutic target for prostate cancers that are resistant to cisplatin.""","""['Zhi-Ping Cai', 'Shi-Jun Tong', 'Ya-Pei Wu', 'Lian-Xi Qu', 'Qiang Ding']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Int J Clin Exp Pathol""","""['MiR-181a suppresses autophagy and sensitizes gastric cancer cells to cisplatin.', 'MiR-181a promotes epithelial to mesenchymal transition of prostate cancer cells by targeting TGIF2.', 'Upregulation of microRNA-181a-5p increases the sensitivity of HS578T breast cancer cells to cisplatin by inducing vitamin D receptor-mediated cell autophagy.', 'MicroRNA-181a enhances the chemoresistance of human cervical squamous cell carcinoma to cisplatin by targeting PRKCD.', 'MicroRNA-181a promotes docetaxel resistance in prostate cancer cells.', 'tRNALys-Derived Fragment Alleviates Cisplatin-Induced Apoptosis in Prostate Cancer Cells.']"""

Methods:   PCa tissues were obtained from 78 patients. PCa cell lines DU145 and RWPE-2 were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and Western blot were conducted to analyze the expression of TM4SF1 in PCa tissues and DU145 cells. Plasmid containing over-expressed TM4SF1 was achieved by plasmid transfection. Transwell assay and wound-healing assay were designed to examine the invasion and migration of DU145 cells, whereas colony formation assay and 5-Ethynyl-2'- deoxyuridine (EdU) staining assay were performed to study the proliferation ability of DU145 cells.  Results:   TM4SF1 was found over-expressed in PCa tissues and DU145 cells. Over-expression of TM4SF1 significantly activated the extracellular regulated protein kinases (ERK)1/2 signaling pathway, increased the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) expression, and enhanced the invasion, migration and proliferation of DU145 cells. Further studies revealed that suppression of ERK1/2 signaling pathway nearly resisted the positive effects on DU145 cells induced by TM4SF1 over-expression.

Caspase-8 is upregulated and localized to the nucleus in multiple human cancers, correlating with treatment resistance and poor clinical outcome. Depletion of caspase-8 causes G2/M arrest, stabilization of p53, and induction of p53-dependent intrinsic apoptosis in tumor cells. In the nucleus, caspase-8 cleaves and inactivates the ubiquitin-specific peptidase 28 (USP28), preventing USP28 from de-ubiquitinating and stabilizing wild-type p53.

Material and methods:   Patients were included in a W&W-approach (2004-2019) when digital rectal examination, endoscopy and MRI showed a (near)clinical complete response. Patients underwent endoscopy and MRI every 3 months during the first year, and 6-monthly thereafter. Patients aged ≥75 and ≥ 2 years of follow-up (FU) were selected. Oncological outcomes were assessed with Kaplan-Meier curves. Functional outcome was assessed with colostomy-free rate, Vaizey incontinence score, low anterior resection syndrome-score and International Prostate Syndrome Score.  Results:   43/304 (14%) of patients in a W&W-approach met the inclusion criteria. Median FU was 37 (24-109) months. 5/43(12%) developed a local regrowth. All were treated surgically, with one patient experiencing a pelvic failure. Distant metastases occurred in 3/43 patients and 4 patients died, 3 of whom not related to rectal cancer. The 3-year local regrowth-free rate was 88%, 3-year non-regrowth disease-free survival 91%, overall survival 97% and 3-year colostomy-free rate 93%. Overall, the bowel- and urinary dysfunction scores at 3, 12 and 24 months indicated good continence, no or minor LARS and moderate urinary problems.  Conclusion:   W&W for older patients with a clinical (near) complete response appears to be a safe alternative to a total mesorectal excision (TME), with a very high pelvic control rate, and few rectal cancer related deaths.

The aim of this study is to investigate whether leukocyte telomere length (LTL) is associated with aggressive prostate cancer (PCa).  Methods:   We measured relative LTL in a cohort of 1,889 white PCa patients who were treated and followed up at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center and assessed its associations with aggressive disease characteristics at diagnosis and biochemical recurrence (BCR) after active treatments (radical prostatectomy and radiotherapy). We further used a Mendelian randomization (MR) approach to compute a weighted genetic risk score (GRS) predictive of LTL using 10 established LTL-associated genetic variants and determined whether this GRS is associated with aggressive PCa.  Findings:   LTL was significantly shorter in patients with higher Gleason scores at diagnosis. Dichotomized at the median value of LTL, patients with short LTL exhibited a 2.74-fold (95% confidence interval, 1.79-4.18, P = 3.11 × 10-6) increased risk of presenting with GS≥8 disease than those with long LTL in multivariate logistic regression analysis. Moreover, shorter LTL was significantly associated with an increased risk of BCR (hazard ratio = 1.53, 95% confidence interval, 1.01-2.34) compared to longer LTL in localized patients receiving prostatectomy or radiotherapy with a significant dose-response association (P for trend = 0.017) in multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression analysis. In MR analysis, genetically predicted short LTL was also associated with an increased risk of BCR (HR=1.73, 95% CI, 1.08-2.78).  Interpretation:   Our results showed for the first time that LTL was shorter in PCa patients with high Gleason scores and that short LTL and genetically predicted short LTL are associated with worse prognosis in PCa patients receiving prostatectomy or radiotherapy.

Rectal sparing devices such as hydrogel spacers offer the prospect of increased space between the prostate and rectum, causing reduced rectal dose and potentially reduced injury. This study sought to help identify patients at higher risk of developing rectal injury based on estimated rectal dosimetry compliance prior to the EBRT simulation and planning procedure. Three statistical machine learning methods were compared for their ability to predict rectal dose outcomes with varied classification thresholds applied.  Methods:   Prostate cancer patients treated with conventionally fractionated EBRT to a reference dose of 74-78 Gy were invited to participate in the study. The dose volume histogram data from each dosimetric plan was used to quantify planned rectal volume receiving 50%, 83% 96%, and 102% of the reference dose. Patients were classified into two groups for each of these dose levels: either meeting tolerance by having a rectal volume less than a clinically acceptable threshold for the dose level (Y) or violating the tolerance by having a rectal volume greater than the threshold for the dose level (N). Logistic regression, classification and regression tree, and random forest models were compared for their ability to discriminate between class outcomes. Performance metrics included area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC), sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value. Finally, three classification threshold levels were evaluated for their impact on model performance.  Results:   A total of 176 eligible participants were recruited. Variable importance differed between model methods. Area under the receiver operator characteristic curve performance varied greatly across the different rectal dose levels and between models. Logistic regression performed best at the 83% reference dose level with an AUC value of 0.844, while random forest demonstrated best discrimination at the 96% reference dose level with an AUC value of 0.733. In addition to the standard classification probability threshold of 50%, the clinically representative threshold of 10%, and the best threshold from each AUC plot was applied to compare metrics. This showed that using a 50% threshold and the best threshold from the AUC plots yields similar results. Conversely, applying the more conservative clinical threshold of 10% maximized the sensitivity at V83_RD and V96_RD for all model types. Based on the combination of the metrics, logistic regression would be the recommendation for rectal protocol compliance prediction at the 83% reference dose level, and random forest for the 96% reference dose level, particularly when using the clinical probability threshold of 10%.  Conclusions:   This study demonstrated the efficacy of statistical machine learning models on rectal protocol compliance prediction for prostate cancer EBRT dosimetric planning. Both logistic regression and random forest modeling approaches demonstrated good discriminative ability for predicting class outcomes in the upper dose levels. Application of a conservative clinical classification threshold maximized sensitivity and further confirmed the value of logistic regression and random forest models over classification and regression tree.""","""['Scott Jones', 'Catriona Hargrave', 'Timothy Deegan', 'Tanya Holt', 'Kerrie Mengersen']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Comparison of different contouring definitions of the rectum as organ at risk (OAR) and dose-volume parameters predicting rectal inflammation in radiotherapy of prostate cancer: which definition to use?', 'An overlap-volume-histogram based method for rectal dose prediction and automated treatment planning in the external beam prostate radiotherapy following hydrogel injection.', 'Investigating rectal toxicity associated dosimetric features with deformable accumulated rectal surface dose maps for cervical cancer radiotherapy.', 'Prostate-rectum spacers: optimization of prostate cancer irradiation.', 'Effectiveness of rectal displacement devices during prostate external-beam radiation therapy: A review.', 'Novel deep learning-based noise reduction technique for prostate magnetic resonance imaging.']"""

This report describes our implementation of automatic marker detection with periodic kV imaging (TrueBeam v2.5) to monitor and correct intrafraction motion during prostate RT.  Methods:   We evaluated the reproducibility and accuracy of software fiducial detection using a phantom with 3 implanted fiducial markers. Clinical implementation for patients with intraprostatic fiducials receiving volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) utilized periodic on-board kV imaging with 10 s intervals during treatment delivery. For each image, the software automatically identified fiducial locations and determined whether their distance relative to planned locations were within a 3 mm tolerance. Motion was corrected if either ≥2 fiducials in a single image or ≥1 fiducial in sequential images were out of tolerance.  Results:   Phantom studies demonstrated poorer performance of linear fiducials compared to collapsible fiducials, and wide variability to accurately detect fiducials across eight software settings. For any given setting, results were relatively reproducible and precise to ~0.5 mm. Across 17 patients treated with a median of 20 fractions, the software recommended a shift in 44% of fractions, and a shift was actually implemented after visual confirmation of movement greater than the 3 mm threshold in 20% of fractions. Adjustment of our approach led to improved accuracy for the latter (n = 7) patient subset. On average, table repositioning added 3.0 ± 0.3 min to patient time on table. Periodic kV imaging increased skin dose by an estimated 1 cGy per treatment arc.  Conclusions:   Periodic kV imaging with automatic detection of motion during VMAT prostate treatments is commercially available, and can be successfully implemented to mitigate effects of intrafraction motion with careful attention to software settings.""","""['Mark C Korpics', 'Michelle Rokni', 'Michael Degnan', 'Bulent Aydogan', 'Stanley L Liauw', 'Gage Redler']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""J Appl Clin Med Phys""","""['Simultaneous MV-kV imaging for intrafractional motion management during volumetric-modulated arc therapy delivery.', 'Developing a MLC modifier program to improve fiducial detection for MV/kV imaging during hypofractionated prostate volumetric modulated arc therapy.', 'Kilovoltage intrafraction monitoring during normofractionated prostate cancer radiotherapy.', 'Image-Guided Radiotherapy for Pelvic Cancers: A Review of Current Evidence and Clinical Utilisation.', 'A review of artificial intelligence applications for motion tracking in radiotherapy.', 'Implementation of triggered kilovoltage imaging for stereotactic radiotherapy of the spine for patients with spinal fixation hardware.', 'Clinical validation of the Varian Truebeam intra-fraction motion review (IMR) system for prostate treatment guidance.', 'Triggered kV Imaging During Spine SBRT for Intrafraction Motion Management.', 'Interpretation of intrafraction motion review data and method for verification.', 'A prospective trial of stereotactic body radiation therapy for unresectable pancreatic cancer testing ablative doses.']"""

Materials and methods:   The risk of readmission was evaluated by clinical, pathological, and perioperative factors. Skilled and experienced surgeons performed the procedures. Patients were followed for complications and hospital readmission for a period of six months. The logistic regression model and Cox's proportional hazards assessed the association of factors with the risk of readmission.  Results:   From January 2013 to December 2018, 890 patients underwent RARP; ePLND was performed in 495 of these patients. Hospital readmission was detected in 25 cases (2.8%); moreover, it was more frequent when RARP was performed with ePLND (4.4% of cases) than without (0.8% of patients). On the final multivariate model, ePLND was the only independent factor that was positively associated with the risk of hospital readmission (hazard ratio, HR = 5935; 95%CI 1777-19,831; p = 0.004).  Conclusions:   Over the long term after RARP for PCA, the risk of hospital readmission is associated with ePLND. In patients who underwent RARP and ePLND, 4.4% of them had a readmission, compared to RARP alone, in which only 0.8% of cases had a readmission.

However, treatment failure often ensues due to tumor intrinsic or acquired radioresistance. Here we find that the MEK5/ERK5 signaling pathway is associated with resistance to genotoxic stress in aggressive prostate cancer cells. MEK5 knockdown by RNA interference sensitizes prostate cancer cells to ionizing radiation (IR) and etoposide treatment, as assessed by clonogenic survival and short-term proliferation assays. Mechanistically, MEK5 downregulation impairs phosphorylation of the catalytic subunit of DNA-PK at serine 2056 in response to IR or etoposide treatment. Although MEK5 knockdown does not influence the initial appearance of radiation- and etoposide-induced γH2AX and 53BP1 foci, it markedly delays their resolution, indicating a DNA repair defect. A cell-based assay shows that nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) is compromised in cells with ablated MEK5 protein expression. Finally, MEK5 silencing combined with focal irradiation causes strong inhibition of tumor growth in mouse xenografts, compared with MEK5 depletion or radiation alone. These findings reveal a convergence between MEK5 signaling and DNA repair by NHEJ in conferring resistance to genotoxic stress in advanced prostate cancer and suggest targeting MEK5 as an effective therapeutic intervention in the management of this disease.""","""['Constantinos G Broustas', 'Axel J Duval', 'Kunal R Chaudhary', 'Richard A Friedman', 'Renu K Virk', 'Howard B Lieberman']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Oncogene""","""['MEK5/ERK5 signaling inhibition increases colon cancer cell sensitivity to 5-fluorouracil through a p53-dependent mechanism.', 'The MEK5-ERK5 Kinase Axis Controls Lipid Metabolism in Small-Cell Lung Cancer.', 'Proteomic analysis of tumor necrosis factor-alpha resistant human breast cancer cells reveals a MEK5/Erk5-mediated epithelial-mesenchymal transition phenotype.', 'Oncogenic signaling of MEK5-ERK5.', 'Targeted Avenues for Cancer Treatment: The MEK5-ERK5 Signaling Pathway.', 'Pathophysiological Impact of the MEK5/ERK5 Pathway in Oxidative Stress.', 'P38 MAPK and Radiotherapy: Foes or Friends?', 'DNA damage repair-related gene signature predicts prognosis and indicates immune cell infiltration landscape in skin cutaneous melanoma.', 'Multifaceted regulation and functions of 53BP1 in NHEJ‑mediated DSB repair (Review).', 'FOXP1 and NDRG1 act differentially as downstream effectors of RAD9-mediated prostate cancer cell functions.']"""

We evaluated the relationship between MFS and OS in nonmetastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (nmCRPC).  Patients and methods:   A retrospective analysis of 1207 high-risk patients with nmCRPC from the SPARTAN study (clinicaltrials.gov, NCT01946204) was undertaken. Landmark analyses of MFS status at several time points from randomization were performed to minimize guarantee-time bias. Hazard ratio (HR) of death as a function of MFS status was estimated based on a Cox proportional hazards model with 2-sided 95% confidence interval (CI). Estimated HRs were adjusted for stratification factors. Correlation analysis was performed using the Fleischer method.  Results:   At all time points, MFS status strongly predicted OS. At landmark time points of 6, 9, and 12 months, risk of death was significantly higher for patients with metastases versus those without (adjusted HR at 6 months = 4.12; 95% CI, 2.60-6.54; P < .0001). MFS was positively correlated with OS based on the Fleischer method (HR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.69-0.70; P < .0001). Approximately one-half of the variability in OS can be explained by MFS.

The recently released Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Prostate with WW dataset provides an opportunity to understand national patterns and trends in AS/WW, but the data source itself has not been well described.  Objective:   To provide a comprehensive description of this dataset and investigate possible biases due to missing data.  Design, setting, and participants:   The SEER is a population-based epidemiologic registry in the USA. Newly diagnosed PCa patient data were collected from 18 SEER registries between 2010 and 2015, with inclusion of a new treatment variable for AS/WW. We identified 316 724 patients in the entire cohort and 257 060 men with clinically localized PCa (T1-2N0M0).  Intervention:   Various primary treatments for PCa.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   The degree of missing data for each variable was measured. In order to investigate possible bias due to missing data for cancer characterization, we compared two versions of the data: one that excluded cases with missing data and one dataset generated applying multiple imputations.  Results and limitations:   Only 46% of cases had complete data on basic cancer characteristics for risk stratification. The excluded dataset (N=118 821) differed significantly from the multiple imputation dataset (N=257 060) in the distribution of every reported variable (all p<0.001). The dataset does not distinguish WW from AS, which is a limitation.  Conclusions:   While the SEER Prostate with WW dataset offers a new method to describe treatment trends for men with PCa, including the use of AS/WW, the amount of missing data should not be ignored.

Nevertheless, frequent occurrence of therapy resistance represents a major challenge in the clinical management of patients, also because the molecular mechanisms behind therapy resistance are not yet fully understood. In the present study, we therefore aimed to identify novel targets to intervene with therapy resistance using gene expression analysis of PCa co-culture spheroids where PCa cells are grown in the presence of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and which have been previously shown to be a reliable model for antiandrogen resistance.  Methods:   Gene expression changes of co-culture spheroids (LNCaP and DuCaP seeded together with CAFs) were identified by Illumina microarray profiling. Real-time PCR, Western blotting, immunohistochemistry and cell viability assays in 2D and 3D culture were performed to validate the expression of selected targets in vitro and in vivo. Cytokine profiling was conducted to analyze CAF-conditioned medium.  Results:   Gene expression analysis of co-culture spheroids revealed that CAFs induced a significant upregulation of cholesterol and steroid biosynthesis pathways in PCa cells. Cytokine profiling revealed high amounts of pro-inflammatory, pro-migratory and pro-angiogenic factors in the CAF supernatant. In particular, two genes, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-Coenzyme A synthase 2 (HMGCS2) and aldo-keto reductase family 1 member C3 (AKR1C3), were significantly upregulated in PCa cells upon co-culture with CAFs. Both enzymes were also significantly increased in human PCa compared to benign tissue with AKR1C3 expression even being associated with Gleason score and metastatic status. Inhibiting HMGCS2 and AKR1C3 resulted in significant growth retardation of co-culture spheroids as well as of various castration and enzalutamide resistant cell lines in 2D and 3D culture, underscoring their putative role in PCa. Importantly, dual targeting of cholesterol and steroid biosynthesis with simvastatin, a commonly prescribed cholesterol synthesis inhibitor, and an inhibitor against AKR1C3 had the strongest growth inhibitory effect.  Conclusions:   From our results we conclude that CAFs induce an upregulation of cholesterol and steroid biosynthesis in PCa cells, driving them into AR targeted therapy resistance. Blocking both pathways with simvastatin and an AKR1C3 inhibitor may therefore be a promising approach to overcome resistances to AR targeted therapies in PCa.

The objective of the current study was to characterize diabetes care management patterns among patients with cancer in the year before and, separately, after cancer diagnosis. The authors hypothesized that diabetes care declines after a diagnosis of cancer.  Methods:   The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) cancer registry linked to Medicare claims data was used. The authors included diabetic beneficiaries aged ≥65 years who were diagnosed with incident, nonmetastatic breast, prostate, or colorectal cancer between 2008 and 2013. Controls were diabetic Medicare beneficiaries in SEER regions who did not have cancer. Cases were matched to controls based on age, sex, Charlson Comorbidity Index, and diabetes severity. Primary outcomes were diabetes care received over 12 months: 1) hemoglobin A1c testing; 2) eye examination; and 3) low-density lipoprotein testing. Using a difference-in-difference (DID) approach, the authors examined use differences 12 months before to after diagnosis for patients with cancer and controls. To avoid capturing testing related to diagnosis and not diabetes management, the authors implemented a 90-day washout period (45 days before and/or after diagnosis).  Results:   A total of 32,728 diabetic patients with cancer and 32,728 matched noncancer controls were included. After diagnosis, patients with cancer were found to have modest, but significantly lower, rates of diabetes care use compared with controls. Patients with cancer had greater declines in hemoglobin A1c testing (DID, 2.4%; 95% CI, 1.7%-3.0%), low-density lipoprotein testing (DID, 4.3%; 95% CI, 3.6%-5.0%), and receipt of all diabetes indicators (DID, 2.7%; 95% CI, 1.8%-3.5%) 12 months before to after diagnosis.

For colorectal cancer, the observed survival disadvantage in lower socio-economic regions was greater for men than for women, while for brain and central nervous system tumours, it was larger for women. Cancer survival is generally lower for residents of more socio-economically disadvantaged areas. Identifying the underlying reasons for these inequalities is important and may help to identify effective interventions to increase survival for underprivileged cancer patients.""","""['Nina Afshar', 'Dallas R English', 'Tony Blakely', 'Vicky Thursfield', 'Helen Farrugia', 'Graham G Giles', 'Roger L Milne']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Differences in cancer survival by remoteness of residence: an analysis of data from a population-based cancer registry.', 'Italian cancer figures--Report 2015: The burden of rare cancers in Italy.', 'Differences in cancer survival by sex: a population-based study using cancer registry data.', 'Socio-economic inequalities in stage at diagnosis, and in time intervals on the lung cancer pathway from first symptom to treatment: systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Origins of socio-economic inequalities in cancer survival: a review.', 'Global disparities in patients with multiple myeloma: a rapid evidence assessment.', 'Cancer Prevention Literacy among Different Population Subgroups: Challenges and Enabling Factors for Adopting and Complying with Cancer Prevention Recommendations.', 'Small-Area Geographic and Socioeconomic Inequalities in Colorectal Cancer in Cyprus.', ""Does women's empowerment and their socioeconomic condition affect the uptake of breast cancer screening?

Focus was directed here on how the five SH3 domains of Tks5 impact that activity. Mutations designed to inhibit protein-protein interactions were created in the individual SH3 domains of Tks5, and the constructs were introduced into the LNCaP prostate carcinoma cell line, a model system with intrinsically low Tks5 expression and which our lab had previously showed the dependence of Src-dependent Tks5 phosphorylation on invadopodia development. In LNCaP cells, acute increases in wild-type Tks5 led to increased gelatin matrix degradation. A similar result was observed when Tks5 was mutated in its 4th or 5th SH3 domains. This was in contrast to the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd SH3 domain mutations of Tks5 where each had a remarkable accentuating effect on gelatin degradation. Conversely, in the invadopodia-competent Src-3T3 model system, mutations in any one of the first three SH3 domains had a dominant negative effect that largely eliminated the presence of invadopodia, inhibited gelatin degradation activity, and redistributed both Src, cortactin, and Tks5 to what are likely endosomal compartments.

In the pivotal placebo-controlled fracture trial of the RANKL inhibitor denosumab in women with postmenopausal osteoporosis, treatment was associated with a lower incidence of non-fracture-related falls (p = 0.02). This ad hoc exploratory analysis pooled data from five placebo-controlled trials of denosumab to determine consistency across trials, if any, of the reduction of fall incidence. The analysis included trials in women with postmenopausal osteoporosis and low bone mass, men with osteoporosis, women receiving adjuvant aromatase inhibitors for breast cancer, and men receiving androgen deprivation therapy for prostate cancer. The analysis was stratified by trial, and only included data from the placebo-controlled period of each trial. A time-to-event analysis of first fall and exposure-adjusted subject incidence rates of falls were analyzed. Falls were reported and captured as adverse events. The analysis comprised 10,036 individuals; 5030 received denosumab 60 mg subcutaneously once every 6 months for 12 to 36 months and 5006 received placebo. Kaplan-Meier estimates showed an occurrence of falls in 6.5% of subjects in the placebo group compared with 5.2% of subjects in the denosumab group (hazard ratio = 0.79; 95% confidence interval 0.66-0.93; p = 0.0061). Heterogeneity in study designs did not permit overall assessment of association with fracture outcomes. In conclusion, denosumab may reduce the risk of falls in addition to its established fracture risk reduction by reducing bone resorption and increasing bone mass. These observations require further exploration and confirmation in studies with muscle function or falls as the primary outcome. © 2020 The Authors.

Definite conclusions were challenging because of the small sample size of this study, and so further studies are needed to evaluate the viability of the hypothesis. On the basis of available data, a registration study of 177 Lu-J591 (also known as TLX591) is planned and will use the two-dose fractionation schedule (Telix Pharma Q3 2019 update https://telixpharma.com/news-media/).  Background:   Phase I and II single-dose studies of lutetium-177 (177 Lu)-J591, a radio-labeled antibody binding prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA), demonstrated safety and efficacy with dose response. Modest dose fractionation of 177 Lu-J591 (2 doses) has less myelosuppression per similar cumulative dose, allowing higher doses to be administered safely. We hypothesized that additional dose fractionation would allow a higher cumulative dose, potentially with less toxicity and more efficacy.  Methods:   Men with progressive metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer and adequate organ function were enrolled. 177 Lu-J591 was administered at 25 mCi/m2 every 2 weeks until the emergence of related grade 2 toxicity. 177 Lu-J591 imaging was performed and circulating tumor cell (CTC) counts were measured before and after treatment along with standard monitoring.  Results:   Six subjects in a single cohort, with a median age of 68.6 years, were enrolled. Patients received three to six doses (cumulative 75-150 mCi/m2 ). Two (33%) patients had >30% prostate-specific antigen (PSA) decline and three (50%) had CTC count decline. Two (33%) experienced grade (Gr) 4 neutropenia (without fever), three (50%) had Gr 4 thrombocytopenia (without hemorrhage), and two (33%) required platelet transfusions. Following hematological improvement, two patients developed worsening cytopenia during prostate cancer progression; bone marrow biopsies revealed infiltrative tumor replacing normal marrow elements without myelodysplasia.

Earlier studies revealed that GBP1 expression was inflammatory cytokines-inducible, and most of the studies focused on inflammation diseases. Increasing number of cancer studies began to reveal its biological role in cancers recently, although with contradictory findings in literature. It was discovered from our earlier prostate cancer cell line models studies that when prostate cancer cells treated with either ethidium bromide or a cell cycle inhibitor flavopiridol for a long-term, the treatment-survived tumor cells experienced metabolic reprogramming toward Warburg effect pathways with greater aggressive features, and one common finding from these cells was the upregulation of GBP1. In this study, possible role of GBP1 in two independent prostate cancer lines by application of CRISR/Cas9 gene knockout (KO) technology was investigated. The GBP1 gene KO DU145 and PC3 prostate cancer cells were significantly less aggressive in vitro, with less proliferation, migration, wound healing, and colony formation capabilities, in addition to a significantly lower level of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and glycolysis. At the same time, such GBP1 KO cells were significantly more sensitive to chemotherapeutic reagents. Xenograft experiments verified a significantly slower tumor growth of the GBP1 KO cells in nude mouse model. Furthermore, GBP1 protein expression in clinical prostate cancer sample revealed its aggressive clinical feature correlation and shorter overall survival association.

Although it is well known that Trp catabolism is induced in the tumor microenvironment by the enzymes expressed in cancer cells, immune cells, or both, few studies have examined systemic Trp catabolism in cancer pathophysiology. The present study aimed to evaluate Trp catabolism in both tumor and peripheral tissues using tumor-engrafted Copenhagen rats that were s.c. inoculated with AT-2 rat prostate cancer cells negative for expression of Trp catabolic enzymes. Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) metabolomics showed significantly decreased plasma Trp levels in AT-2 engrafted rats, accompanied by increased kynurenine/Trp ratios in spleen and thymus and serotonin levels in liver and thymus. Quantitative PCR and enzymatic activity assays showed indoleamine-2, 3-dioxygenase, an inducible enzyme that catalyzes Trp to kynurenine, was increased in tumor tissues, whereas tryptophan-2,3-dioxygenase, a major Trp catabolic enzyme that regulates systemic level of Trp, tended to be increased in the liver of AT-2 engrafted rats. Furthermore, tryptophan hydroxylase-1 (TPH1), an enzyme that catalyzes the reaction of Trp to serotonin, was significantly increased in liver and spleen of AT-2 engrafted rats. Further histochemical analysis revealed that the induction of TPH1 in the liver could be attributed to infiltration of mast cells. A similar phenomenon was observed with nonneoplastic liver samples from colorectal cancer patients. These results suggested that Trp catabolism toward serotonin synthesis might be induced in peripheral remote tissues in cancer, which could have a pathophysiological effect on cancer.""","""['Asami Hagiwara', 'Yoshiyasu Nakamura', 'Rumi Nishimoto', 'Satoko Ueno', 'Yohei Miyagi']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Cancer Sci""","""['Immuno-Metabolic Modulation of Liver Oncogenesis by the Tryptophan Metabolism.', 'Effect of water-immersion restraint stress on tryptophan catabolism through the kynurenine pathway in rat tissues.', 'Mass spectrometric measurement of urinary kynurenine-to-tryptophan ratio in children with and without urinary tract infection.', 'Determination of kynurnine and tryptophan, biomarkers of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase by LC-MS/MS in plasma and tumor.', 'Implications of interferon-induced tryptophan catabolism in cancer, auto-immune diseases and AIDS.', 'Metabolomics of Prostate Cancer Gleason Score in Tumor Tissue and Serum.']"""

Subdermal stimulating electrodes were placed on the patients' bilateral wrists over the ulnar nerve and the nerve was stimulated. Realtime waveforms were compared to baseline data to prevent and detect injury to the ulnar nerve. Established intervention criteria, indicating risk for neuropathic damage necessitating intraoperative patient repositioning, was a 50% loss in amplitude or a 10% increase in latency. One hundred and forty three patients received RALP with IONM. 17 of 143 patients (11.8%) met ueSSEP intervention criteria. Only weight was significantly different between the two groups (p = 0.04). Mean reduction in amplitude was 79.9% (SE 4.1). Average amplitude loss duration was 22 min (SE 4.0). Weight and BMI were correlated to the degree of amplitude reduction (p = 0.03 and < 0.01), while operative time and DM approached significance (p = 0.09 and p = 0.14). This is the first study to use IONM to reduce the risk of nerve injury during genitourinary surgery. Realtime nerve monitoring using ueSSEP allowed for upper extremity intraoperative monitoring and repositioning.

In vitro obese models were established by co-culture of mouse adipocytes 3T3-L1 with androgen-sensitive LNCaP human prostate cancer cells, or by culturing LNCaP cells in adipocytes-conditioned medium. Arctigenin significantly inhibited LNCaP proliferation, along with decreased androgen receptor (AR) and increased Nkx3.1 cellular expression. Male severe combined immunodeficiency mice were subcutaneously implanted with human prostate cancer LAPC-4 xenograft tumors for in vivo study. Mice were fed high-fat (HF) diet and orally given arctigenin at 50 mg/kg body weight daily or vehicle control for 6 weeks. Tumor bearing HF control mice showed a significant increase in serum free fatty acids (FFAs) and decrease in subcutaneous/peritoneal fat depots compared to non-tumor bearing control mice. Arctigenin intervention significantly reduced tumor growth by 45%, associated with decreased circulating FFAs and adipokines/cytokines including IGF-1, VEGF, and MCP-1, along with decreased AR, Ki67, and microvessel density and increased Nkx3.1 expression in tumors.

Many researchers, societies, and guideline committees have suggested that screening intervals could depend on the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) result. We analyzed data from men (N = 33,897) ages 55-74 years with a baseline PSA test in the intervention arm of the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian Cancer Screening trial (United States, 1993-2001). We estimated 5- and 10-year risks of aggressive cancer (Gleason ≥8 and/or stage III/IV) and 15-year risks of prostate cancer-related mortality for men with baseline PSA ≤ 0.5 ng/mL (N = 4,862), ≤1 ng/mL (N = 15,110), and 1.01-2.5 ng/mL (N = 12,422). A total of 217 men died from prostate cancer through 15 years, although no men with PSA ≤ 1 ng/mL died from prostate cancer within 5 years [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.00%-0.03%]. The 5-year incidence of aggressive disease was low (0.08%; 95% CI, 0.03%-0.12%) for men with PSA ≤ 1 ng/mL, and higher for men with baseline PSA 1.01-2.5 ng/mL (0.51%; 95% CI, 0.38%-0.74%). No men aged ≥65 years with PSA ≤ 0.5 ng/mL died from prostate cancer within 15 years (95% CI, 0.00%-0.32%), and their 10-year incidence of aggressive disease was low (0.25%; 95% CI, 0.00%-0.53%). Compared with white men, black men with PSA ≤ 1 ng/mL had higher 10-year rates of aggressive disease (1.6% vs. 0.4%; P < 0.01). Five-year screening intervals may be appropriate for the 45% of men with PSA ≤ 1 ng/mL. Men ages ≥65 years with PSA ≤ 0.5 ng/mL could consider stopping screening.

Research on TRPV6 structure/function, its association with specific cancers, and the evolutionary-ecological conditions that impacted selection of its haplotypes are synthesized to provide evidence for TRPV6 as a germline susceptibility locus in cancer. Recently elucidated mechanisms of TRPV6 channel deactivation are discussed in relation to the location of the allele favored in selection, suggesting a reduced capacity to inactivate the channel in those who have the ancestral haplotype. This could result in an excessively high cellular Ca2+, which has been implicated in cancer, for those in settings where calcium intake is far higher than in their ancestral environment. A recent report associating increasing calcium intake with a pattern of increase in aggressive prostate cancer in African-American but not European-American men may be related.

It exists as two complexes: mTORC1 and mTORC2. mTORC1 is known to be regulated by active AKT, but the activation of mTORC2 is poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the roles and differential activation of the two mTOR complexes during cell migration in prostate cancer cells.  Methods:   We used small interfering RNA to silence the expression of Rac1 and the main components of mTOR complexes (regulatory associated protein of mTOR [RAPTOR] and rapamycin-insensitive companion of mTOR [RICTOR]) in LNCaP, DU145, and PC3 prostate cancer cell lines. We performed transwell migration assay to evaluate the migratory capability of the cells, and Western blot analysis to study the activation levels of mTOR complexes.  Results:   Specific knockdown of RAPTOR and RICTOR caused a decrease of cell migration, suggesting their essential role in prostate cancer cell movement. Furthermore, epidermal growth factor (EGF) treatments induced the activation of both the mTOR complexes. Lack of Rac1 activity in prostate cancer cells blocked EGF-induced activation of mTORC2, but had no effect on mTORC1 activation. Furthermore, the overexpression of constitutively active Rac1 resulted in significant increase in cell migration and activation of mTORC2 in PC3 cells, but had no effect on mTORC1 activation. Active Rac1 was localized in the plasma membrane and was found to be in a protein complex, with RICTOR, but not RAPTOR.  Conclusion:   We suggest that EGF-induced activation of Rac1 causes the activation of mTORC2 via RICTOR. This mechanism plays a critical role in prostate cancer cell migration.""","""['Smrruthi Vaidegi Venugopal', 'Silvia Caggia', 'DaJhnae Gambrell-Sanders', 'Shafiq A Khan']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Two distinct mTORC2-dependent pathways converge on Rac1 to drive breast cancer metastasis.', 'Receptor-recognized α₂-macroglobulin binds to cell surface-associated GRP78 and activates mTORC1 and mTORC2 signaling in prostate cancer cells.', 'Selective interference of mTORC1/RAPTOR protects against human disc cellular apoptosis, senescence, and extracellular matrix catabolism with Akt and autophagy induction.', 'The Role of Mammalian Target of Rapamycin (mTOR) in Insulin Signaling.', 'Discrete signaling mechanisms of mTORC1 and mTORC2: Connected yet apart in cellular and molecular aspects.', 'Rac1 promotes the reprogramming of glucose metabolism and the growth of colon cancer cells through upregulating SOX9.', 'Dual contribution of the mTOR pathway and of the metabolism of amino acids in prostate cancer.', 'Dual Inhibition of mTORC1/2 Reduces Migration of Cholangiocarcinoma Cells by Regulation of Matrixmetalloproteinases.', 'Rac1, A Potential Target for Tumor Therapy.', 'Cx43 Present at the Leading Edge Membrane Governs Promigratory Effects of Osteoblast-Conditioned Medium on Human Prostate Cancer Cells in the Context of Bone Metastasis.']"""

We identified 102,076 men in Prostate Cancer data Base Sweden 4.0 who were diagnosed with prostate cancer in 2006-2016. Risk of metastases was assessed for PSA stratified on T stage and five-tiered GGG. For men who had not undergone bone imaging, we used multiple imputation to classify metastatic prostate cancer. Advanced T stage, high GGG and high PSA were related to bone metastases. For example: only 79/38 190 (0.2%) of men with T1-2 and GGG 1 had PSA above 500 ng/mL, and 29/79 (44%) of these men had metastases; whereas 1 154/7 018 (16%) of men with T3-4 and GGG 5 had PSA above 500 ng/ml and 1 088/1 154 (94%) of these men had metastases. However, no PSA cut-off could accurately identify the majority of men with metastatic prostate cancer (i.e. high sensitivity) while also correctly classifying most men without metastasis (i.e. high specificity).

Currently, the leading automatic segmentation algorithms are based on Fully Convolutional Networks (FCNs), which achieve remarkable performance but usually need large-scale datasets with high-quality voxel-wise annotations for full supervision of the training. Unfortunately, such annotations are difficult to acquire, which becomes a bottleneck to build accurate segmentation models in real clinical applications. In this paper, we propose a novel weakly supervised segmentation approach that only needs 3D bounding box annotations covering the organs of interest to start the training. Obviously, the bounding box includes many non-organ voxels that carry noisy labels to mislead the segmentation model. To this end, we propose the label denoising module and embed it into the iterative training scheme of the label denoising network (LDnet) for segmentation. The labels of the training voxels are predicted by the tentative LDnet, while the label denoising module identifies the voxels with unreliable labels. As only the good training voxels are preserved, the iteratively re-trained LDnet can refine its segmentation capability gradually. Our results are remarkable, i.e., reaching ∼ 94% (prostate), ∼ 91% (bladder), and ∼ 86% (rectum) of the Dice Similarity Coefficients (DSCs), compared to the case of fully supervised learning upon high-quality voxel-wise annotations and also superior to several state-of-the-art approaches. To our best knowledge, this is the first work to achieve voxel-wise segmentation in CT images from simple 3D bounding box annotations, which can greatly reduce many labeling efforts and meet the demands of the practical clinical applications.""","""['Shuai Wang', 'Qian Wang', 'Yeqin Shao', 'Liangqiong Qu', 'Chunfeng Lian', 'Jun Lian', 'Dinggang Shen']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""IEEE Trans Biomed Eng""","""['Deep learning of the sectional appearances of 3D CT images for anatomical structure segmentation based on an FCN voting method.', 'ARPM-net: A novel CNN-based adversarial method with Markov random field enhancement for prostate and organs at risk segmentation in pelvic CT images.', 'CT male pelvic organ segmentation using fully convolutional networks with boundary sensitive representation.', 'Deep Reinforcement Learning for Weakly-Supervised Lymph Node Segmentation in CT Images.', 'Automatic Segmentation of Multiple Organs on 3D CT Images by Using Deep Learning Approaches.', 'Multiple Field-of-View Based Attention Driven Network for Weakly Supervised Common Bile Duct Stone Detection.', 'Dynamic Cross-Task Representation Adaptation for Clinical Targets Co-Segmentation in CT Image-Guided Post-Prostatectomy Radiotherapy.', 'Combining natural and artificial intelligence for robust automatic anatomy segmentation: Application in neck and thorax auto-contouring.', 'Global-Local attention network with multi-task uncertainty loss for abnormal lymph node detection in MR images.', 'A Bounding Box-Based Radiomics Model for Detecting Occult Peritoneal Metastasis in Advanced Gastric Cancer: A Multicenter Study.']"""

Our hypothesis was that anatomical features between planning computed tomography (pCT) and pretreatment cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) images could be used to predict the target, i.e. clinical target volume (CTV) shifts, with small errors. The pCT and daily CBCT images of 20 patients with prostate cancer were selected. The first 10 patients were employed for the development, and the second 10 patients for a validation test. The CTV position errors between the pCT and CBCT images were determined as reference CTV shifts (teacher data) after an automated bone-based registration. The anatomical features associated with rectum, bladder and prostate were calculated from the pCT and CBCT images. The features were fed as the input with the teacher data into five MLAs, i.e. three types of artificial neural networks, support vector regression (SVR) and random forests. Since the CTV shifts along the left-right direction were negligible, the MLAs were developed along the superior-inferior and anterior-posterior directions. The proposed framework was evaluated from the residual errors between the reference and predicted CTV shifts. In the validation test, the mean residual error with its standard deviation was 1.01 ± 1.09 mm in SVR using only one feature (one click), which was associated with positional difference of the upper rectal wall. The results suggested that MLAs with anatomical features could be useful in prediction of CTV shifts for prostate radiotherapy.""","""['Yudai Kai', 'Hidetaka Arimura', 'Kenta Ninomiya', 'Tetsuo Saito', 'Yoshinobu Shimohigashi', 'Akiko Kuraoka', 'Masato Maruyama', 'Ryo Toya', 'Natsuo Oya']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""J Radiat Res""","""['Observer uncertainties of soft tissue-based patient positioning in IGRT.', 'Evaluation of online/offline image guidance/adaptation approaches for prostate cancer radiation therapy.', 'Impact of anatomical interventions on the localization of post-prostatectomy cancer patients.', 'The role of radiomics in prostate cancer radiotherapy.', 'Deep Learning in Radiation Oncology Treatment Planning for Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Review.', 'Inter-fraction deformable image registration using unsupervised deep learning for CBCT-guided abdominal radiotherapy.']"""

Background:   Cancer which can affect almost any part of the body, is most striking and deadliest disease. It is estimated that around one in five people globally develop cancer during their lifetime, and approximately 10% people eventually die from this disease, and 18.1 million new cancer cases with 9.6 million deaths occurred in 2018. The anticancer agents play an intriguingly role in fighting against cancer, and above 100 drugs have already been marketed for this purpose. However, the major drawback of current accessible anticancer agents is the low specificity which results in many side effects. Moreover, cancer cells have already generated resistance to almost all available drugs, creating an urgent need to novel anticancer agents with high specificity and great efficiency especially towards drug-resistant cancers. Quinolone and isatin derivatives were reported to possess promising anticancer activity, high specificity, and relatively few side effects. Currently, several quinolone and isatin derivatives such as Voreloxin, Quarfloxin, AT-3639, Semaxanib, Sunitinib and Nintedanib have already been introduced in clinical practice or under evaluations for the treatment of cancer including drug-resistant cancers, revealing their potential as novel anticancer agents. Hybrid molecules have the potential to increase the specificity, improve the efficiency, and overcome the drug resistance, so hybridization is a promising strategy in the drug discovery. Some of the moxifloxacin-isatin hybrids exhibited considerable activity against various cancer cells even drug-resistant cells, so it is conceivable that hybridization of quinolone and isatin moieties may provide novel anticancer candidates. The structure-activity relationships (SARs) demonstrated that the linkers between quinolone and isatin skeletons were critical for the biological activity, and 1,2,3-triazole could exert various noncovalent interactions with biological targets, so introduction of 1,2,3-triazole as the linker between the two moieties may provide more efficient anticancer candidates.  Objective:   To explore more active fluoroquinolone anticancer candidates and enrich the structureactivity relationships of fluoroquinolone-isatin hybrids.  Methods:   The synthesized moxifloxacin-isatin hybrids 5a-c, 6a-g and 13a-d were assessed for their anticancer activities against liver cancer cells HepG2, breast cancer cells MCF-7, MCF-7/DOX, prostate cancer cells DU-145 and MDR DU-145 by MTT assay. Hybrid 5b was selected for further evaluation of its tubulin polymerization inhibitory activity with combretastatin A-4 as comparison.  Result:   Most of the synthesized hybrids were active against the tested cancer cell lines, and the most active hybrid 5b (IC50: 31.3-76.8 μM) was more potent than vorinostat (IC50: 96.7->100 μM), demonstrating moxifloxacin-isatin hybrids are potential anticancer candidates.  Conclusion:   The mechanism study revealed that inhibition of tubulin polymerization is at least one of the mechanisms of action for this kind of hybrids.

Although ApoD has been reported to be a marker of breast cancer, its prognostic importance in invasive breast cancer is unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between ApoD protein expression, oestrogen receptor-α (ERα) expression and androgen receptor (AR) expression in predicting breast cancer outcome.  Methods and results:   ApoD levels were measured by the use of immunohistochemistry and video image analysis on tissue sections from a breast cancer cohort (n = 214). We assessed the associations of ApoD expression with disease-free survival (DFS), metastasis-free survival (MFS), and overall survival (OS). We also assessed the relationship between ApoD expression, AR expression and ERα expression in predicting OS. ApoD expression (>1% ApoD positivity) was found in 72% (154/214) of tissues. High ApoD positivity (≥20.7%, fourth quartile) was an independent predictor of MFS and OS, and conferred a 2.2-fold increased risk of developing metastatic disease and a 2.1-fold increased risk of breast cancer-related death. ApoD positivity was not associated with AR or ERα nuclear positivity. However, patients with (≥1%) ERα-positive cancers with low (<20.7%) ApoD positivity, or those showing high (≥78%) AR positivity and low (<20.7%) ApoD positivity had better OS than other patient groups.

In addition, the proposed MRS model can accommodate noninformative right-censoring times for nonterminating and terminating events. Properties of the proposed MRS model are examined in detail. Theoretical and empirical results show that the estimates of the cumulative incidence function for a nonterminating event may be biased if the information on a terminating event is ignored. A Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling algorithm is also developed. Our methodology is further assessed using simulations and also an analysis of the real data from a prostate cancer study. As a result, a prostate-specific antigen velocity greater than 2.0 ng/mL per year and higher biopsy Gleason scores are positively associated with a shorter time to death due to prostate cancer.""","""['Mário de Castro', 'Ming-Hui Chen', 'Yuanye Zhang', ""Anthony V D'Amico""]""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Biometrics""","""['Bayesian inference of the fully specified subdistribution model for survival data with competing risks.', 'Accelerated failure time models for semi-competing risks data in the presence of complex censoring.', 'Bayesian gamma frailty models for survival data with semi-competing risks and treatment switching.', 'Joint modelling of longitudinal and survival data in the presence of competing risks with applications to prostate cancer data.', 'A note on competing risks in survival data analysis.']"""

Chemical investigation of G. junonius fruiting bodies was performed, resulting in the isolation and structural identification of three sesquiterpenes (1-3), including a new trichothecene sesquiterpene (2) and a new tremulane sesquiterpene (3). Compound 1 was identified from G. junonius for the first time.

In particular, the absolute configurations of compounds 2 and 3 were unambiguously determined by quantum chemical electronic circular dichroism (ECD) calculations. The isolated compounds (1-3) were evaluated for their cytotoxic effects on human lung and prostate cancer cell lines where trichothecene sesquiterpenes (1 and 2) showed remarkable cytotoxicity similar to that of the control drug, i.e., doxorubicin.

Methods:   A multicenter, open-label, randomized, controlled study including patients with hormone-sensitive PCa without bone metastasis receiving ADT was performed. Patients were randomized (1:1:1) to minodronate, denosumab, or no agent control groups. The primary end point was the mean percentage change in BMD at the lumbar spine at 12 months. Secondary end points were the mean percentage change in BMD at the femoral neck and total hip and changes in bone turnover markers. Statistical comparison was performed using analysis of covariance.  Results:   Of the 147 subjects enrolled in this study, 102 were randomly assigned into the minodronate (n = 36), denosumab (n = 36), and control (n = 30) groups.

The benefit of CT urography for differentiation of lymph node metastasis from urinary tract activity was evaluated in a ""PET/CT with low-dose CT"" setting.  Methods:   Retrospective analysis of PET/CT for primary staging, biochemical recurrence or local treatment planning in patients with prostate cancer. For CT urography (CTU), iodinated contrast agent was administered 10 minutes prior to image acquisition. All potential pathologic (peri)ureteral tracer uptake was assigned to excretory ureteral accumulation or pathological lesion. To assess additional provided benefit of CTU all foci were rated with an introduced scoring system (ranging from 0 pts: CTU not needed; up to 3 pts: no differentiation possible without CTU). Success of ureter contrasting was assessed by measurement of Hounsfield units. Besides benefit for reading urography-enhanced PET/CT, the possible impact on subsequent patient treatment was evaluated.  Results:   A number of N.=247 patients were included in this study. By CT urography, it was possible to identify each ureter on low-dose CT, with its major part contrasted. In 120/247 (48.6%) patients, urography increased the diagnostic confidence while providing substantial support for interpretation in 60 (24.3%) cases. In 42 (17.0%) patients, urography was clinically relevant (up-/downstaging) with potential impact on subsequent patient care. In 30 of these 42 cases (12.1% of all), discrepant treatment would have resulted from a misdiagnosed tracer accumulation without urography.  Conclusions:   CT urography benefits the interpretation of [68Ga]-PSMA-11 PET/CT with low-dose CT and leads to discrepant patient treatment in a small but significant subset of patients (12% in our cohort).

However, cancer outcome depends not only on cancer cells' activity, but also on the stromal cells, which coevolve with cancer cells to sustain tumor progression. Here, we show for the first time that cannabinoid treatment impairs the activation and the reactivity of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), the most represented stromal component of prostate tumor microenvironment. Using prostate cancer-derived CAFs, we demonstrated that WIN 55-212.2 mesylate, a synthetic full agonist of cannabinoid receptors (CBs) 1 and 2, downregulates α-smooth muscle actin and matrix metalloprotease-2 expression, and it inhibits CAF migration, essential features to ensure the activated and reactive CAF phenotype. Furthermore, by impairing stromal reactivity, WIN 55-212.2 mesylate also negatively affects CAF-mediated cancer cells' invasiveness. Using selective antagonists of CBs, we proved that CAFs response to WIN 55-212.2 mesylate is mainly mediated by CB2. Finally, we suggest that endocannabinoids self-sustain both prostate tumor cells migration and CAFs phenotype by an autocrine loop.

Materials and methods:   A cross-sectional analysis was performed using discharge data from the National Inpatient Sample from 1999 to 2008. Cancer was defined as the primary discharge diagnosis and AD was defined as the secondary discharge diagnosis. Cancer types were grouped according to their Pin1 expression to examine its relationship with AD. Analysis was performed by logistic regression.  Results:   Of ∼3 million cancer discharge diagnoses, 1.0% had a secondary diagnosis of AD. Discharge data of all 10 cancer types revealed a lower likelihood of secondary AD diagnosis. Prostate [crude odds ratios (OR): 0.26 (0.24 to 0.29), multivariate OR: 0.39 (0.35 to 0.43)], ovarian [crude OR: 0.38 (0.32 to 0.44), multivariate OR: 0.35 (0.30 to 0.41)], and lung cancer [crude OR: 0.39 (0.36 to 0.41), multivariate OR: 0.41 (0.39 to 0.44)] demonstrated the lowest odds of secondary AD diagnosis. When cancer types were grouped per Pin1 expression, cancer types with Pin1 underexpression were more likely to be associated with secondary diagnosis of AD than cancer types with Pin1 overexpression [crude OR: 1.4 (1.3 to 1.4), multivariate OR: 1.08 (1.02 to 1.14)].  Discussion:   This secondary data analysis further demonstrated an inverse relationship between AD and 10 cancer types, with prostate, ovarian, and lung cancers displaying the greatest inverse relationship. Pin1 underexpressing cancer types had a significantly higher likelihood of secondary diagnosis of AD than Pin1 overexpressing cancer types.""","""['Ayesha Z Sherzai', 'Melvin Parasram', 'Janelle M Haider', 'Dean Sherzai']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Alzheimer Dis Assoc Disord""","""[""Cancer and Alzheimer's disease inverse relationship: an age-associated diverging derailment of shared pathways."", ""Promoter Methylation and Gene Expression of Pin1 Associated with the Risk of Alzheimer's Disease in Southern Chinese."", ""Gene promoter methylation and expression of Pin1 differ between patients with frontotemporal dementia and Alzheimer's disease."", ""The significance of Pin1 in the development of Alzheimer's disease."", ""Pin1 dysregulation helps to explain the inverse association between cancer and Alzheimer's disease."", ""Identification of peripheral blood immune infiltration signatures and construction of monocyte-associated signatures in ovarian cancer and Alzheimer's disease using single-cell sequencing."", 'Comorbidity among inpatients with dementia: a preliminary cross-sectional study in West China.', ""Autoencoder Networks Decipher the Association between Lung Cancer and Alzheimer's Disease."", ""Alzheimer's risk factor FERMT2 promotes the progression of colorectal carcinoma via Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway and contributes to the negative correlation between Alzheimer and cancer."", ""Inverse Correlation Between Alzheimer's Disease and Cancer: Short Overview.""]"""

ASCO has a policy and set of procedures for endorsing clinical practice guidelines that have been developed by other professional organizations.  Methods:   The Bone Health and Bone-Targeted Therapies for Prostate Cancer guideline was reviewed for developmental rigor by methodologists. An ASCO Expert Panel then reviewed the content and the recommendations.  Results:   The ASCO Expert Panel determined that the recommendations from the Bone Health and Bone-Targeted Therapies for Prostate Cancer guideline were clear, thorough, and based on the most relevant scientific evidence.

Since seminal vesicle invasion (SVI) is an important independent predictor of biochemical recurrence (BCR), this study was designed to evaluate the influence of isolated SVI in the absence of capsular/margin invasion on BCR. Material and Methods: Pathology reports of 2009 robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy specimens were analyzed retrospectively excluding capsular breach and/or margin-positive cases to include 1409 patients in the study. Factors predicting SVI and BCR in this select group of patients were assessed and statistically analyzed. Survival analysis for PSA (prostate-specific antigen) failure probability and binomial regressions for variable predictability were performed. Results: The African American race was associated with SVI (p < 0.05). PSA had a directly proportional correlation with the occurrence of SVI and BCR. SVI was found to be an independent predictor of BCR, leading to higher odds of BCR at 5 years (odds ratio [OR] 8.2, 95% confidence interval [CI] 4.5-14.6, p < 0.0001). When the seminal vesicle was invaded, the specimen Gleason grade group (SGGG; OR 1.9, 95% CI 1.02-3.7, p = 0.04), PSA (OR 1.2, 95% CI 1.01-1.4, p = 0.03), and BMI (body mass index) (OR 1.2, 95% CI 1.04-1.5, p = 0.01) predicted BCR. Seminal vesicle involvement was not found in SGGG 1. Risk stratification of significant predictors of BCR with isolated SVI identified a subgroup with BMI ≤27.9 kg/m2, PSA ≤8.6 ng/mL, and SGGG 2, which had a significantly better prognosis (p = 0.029, log-rank test). Conclusions: Seminal vesicles are infrequently involved with SGGG 1. Select groups of patients with isolated SVI who have low-grade disease with relatively lower PSA and BMI do not have an aggressive biological behavior and are unlikely to have a BCR, thereby circumventing unnecessary adjuvant therapy with its attendant side effects. The BMI significantly predicted PSA failures and should be considered as an additional risk assessment tool.""","""['Rajesh Raj Bajpai', 'Shirin Razdan', 'Marcos A Sanchez-Gonzalez', 'Sanjay Razdan']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""J Endourol""","""['The pathway of isolated seminal vesicle invasion has a different impact on biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy and pelvic lymphadenectomy.', 'Seminal vesicle involvement after radical prostatectomy: predicting risk factors for progression.', 'Bilateral Seminal Vesicle Invasion Is Not Associated with Worse Outcomes in Locally Advanced Prostate Carcinoma.', 'Factors influencing biochemical recurrence in patients who have received salvage radiotherapy after radical prostatectomy: a systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Obesity and biochemical recurrence in clinically localised prostate cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis of 86,490 patients.']"""

Inhibitors of androgen receptors have shown especially significant benefits in overall (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS), with a good toxicity profile. Treatment selection depends on the patient's individual clinical, radiological, and biological characteristics.  Objective:   To describe treatment outcomes (efficacy, toxicity) in a cohort of patients with mCRPC in Spain.  Materials and methods:   Multicenter, retrospective study of patients with mCRPC included in a database of the Urological Tumour Working Group (URONCOR) of the Spanish Society of Radiation Oncology (SEOR). Metastatic CRPC was defined according to the prostate cancer working group 3 (PCWG3) criteria. The Kaplan-Meier technique was used to evaluate OS and the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE, v.4.0) were used to assess toxicity. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were performed to identify the factors significantly associated with OS.  Results:   A total of 314 patients from 17 hospitals in Spain diagnosed with mCRPC between June 2010 and September 2017 were included in this study. Mean age at diagnosis was 68 years (range 45-89). At a median follow-up of 35 months, OS at 1, 3, and 5 years were 92%, 38%, and 28%, respectively. Grades 1-2 and grade 3 toxicity rates were, respectively, 68% and 19%. No grade 4 toxicities were observed. On the multivariate analysis, the following factors were significantly associated with OS: age (hazard ratio [HR] 0.42, p = 0.010), PSA value at diagnosis of mCRPC (HR 0.55, p = 0.008), and Gleason score (HR 0.61, p = 0.009).  Conclusions:   Age, Gleason score, and PSA at diagnosis of mCRPC are independently associated with overall survival in patients with mCRPC.

Depending on the enrichment strategy, the ssODNs can identify molecules specifically associated with a defined biological condition, for example a pathological phenotype, and thus are potentially useful for biomarker discovery. We performed ADAPT, a variant of SELEX, on exosomes secreted by VCaP prostate cancer cells. A library of ∼1011 ssODNs was enriched for those that bind to VCaP exosomes and discriminate them from exosomes derived from LNCaP prostate cancer cells. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) identified the best discriminating ssODNs, nine of which were resynthesized and their discriminatory ability confirmed by qPCR. Affinity purification with one of the sequences (Sequence 7) combined with LC-MS/MS identified its molecular target complex, whereof most proteins are part of or associated with the multiprotein ESCRT complex participating in exosome biogenesis. Within this complex, YBX1 was identified as the directly-bound target protein. ADAPT thus is able to differentiate exosomes from cancer cell subtypes from the same lineage.

TCEA3 is upregulated during skeletal muscle differentiation and acts to promote muscle specific gene expression during myogenesis. Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) is a pediatric cancer derived from the muscle lineage, but the expression or function of TCEA3 in RMS was uncharacterized. We found that TCEA3 expression was strongly inhibited in RMS cell lines representing both ERMS and ARMS subtypes of RMS. TCEA3 expression correlates with DNA methylation and we show that TBX2 is also involved in the repression of TCEA3 in RMS cell lines. Ectopic expression of TCEA3 inhibited proliferation of RMS cell lines and initiated apoptosis through both the intrinsic and extrinsic pathways. We found that only pan-caspase inhibitors could block apoptosis in the presence of TCEA3. While expression of TCEA3 is highest in skeletal muscle, expression has been detected in other tissues as well, including breast, ovarian and prostate. We found that ectopic expression of TCEA3 also promotes apoptosis in HeLa, MCF7, MDA-231, and PC3 cell lines, representing cervical, breast, and prostate cancer, respectively. Restoration of TCEA3 expression in RMS cell lines enhanced sensitivity to chemotherapeutic drugs, including TRAIL. Thus, TCEA3 presents a novel target for therapeutic strategies to promote apoptosis and enhance sensitivity to current chemotherapeutic drugs.""","""['Noor Kazim#', 'Abhinav Adhikari#', 'Teak Jung Oh', 'Judith Davie']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Cell Death Dis""","""['TCEA3 binds to TGF-beta receptor I and induces Smad-independent, JNK-dependent apoptosis in ovarian cancer cells.', 'The transcription elongation factor TCEA3 promotes the activity of the myogenic regulatory factors.', 'TCEA3 Attenuates Gastric Cancer Growth by Apoptosis Induction.', 'Therapeutic Approaches Targeting PAX3-FOXO1 and Its Regulatory and Transcriptional Pathways in Rhabdomyosarcoma.', 'HER Tyrosine Kinase Family and Rhabdomyosarcoma: Role in Onset and Targeted Therapy.', 'USP47-Mediated Deubiquitination and Stabilization of TCEA3 Attenuates Pyroptosis and Apoptosis of Colorectal Cancer Cells Induced by Chemotherapeutic Doxorubicin.', 'Identification of a prognostic 4-mRNA signature in laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma.', 'Integrative Analysis of Multi-Omics Identified the Prognostic Biomarkers in Acute Myelogenous Leukemia.', 'Aberrant methylation of GADD45A is associated with decreased radiosensitivity in cervical cancer through the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway.']"""

In 3-dimensional co-culture with neurospheres, red fluorescent human LNCaP cells formed agglomerates on the neurosphere surface. Upon induced neural differentiation, some red fluorescent cells showed morphology of fully differentiated neural cells, indicating fusion between the cancer and neural stem cells. These fusion hybrids survived for extended times in a quiescent state. A few eventually restarted cell division and propagated to form derivative hybrid progenies. Clones of the hybrid progenies were highly heterogeneous; most had lost prostatic and epithelial markers while some had acquired neural marker expression.

Literature-based dose constraints were applied with arithmetic adjustment for the hypofractionated arms. This study aimed to derive anorectal dose constraints using prospectively collected clinician-reported outcomes (CROs) and patient-reported outcomes (PROs) and to assess the added predictive value of spatial dose metrics.  Methods and materials:   A case-control study design was used; 7 CRO and 5 PRO bowel symptoms were evaluated. Cases experienced a moderate or worse symptom 1 to 5 years after-radiation therapy and did not have the symptom before radiation therapy. Controls did not experience the symptom at baseline or between 1 to 5 years after radiation therapy. The anorectum was recontoured from the anal verge to the rectosigmoid junction; dose/volume parameters were extracted. Univariate logistic regression, atlases of complication indices, and bootstrapped receiver-operating-characteristic analysis (1000 replicates, balanced outcomes) were used to derive dose constraints for the whole cohort (hypofractionated schedules were converted to 2-Gy equivalent schedules using α/β = 3 Gy) and separate hypofractionated/conventional fractionation cohorts. Only areas under the curve with 95% confidence interval lower limits >0.5 were considered statistically significant. Any constraint derived in <95% to 99% of bootstraps was excluded.  Results:   Statistically significant dose constraints were derived for CROs but not PROs. Intermediate to high doses were important for rectal bleeding, whereas intermediate doses were important for increased bowel frequency, fecal incontinence, and rectal pain. Spatial dose metrics did not improve prediction of CROs or PROs. A new panel of dose constraints for hypofractionated schedules to 60 Gy or 57 Gy are V20Gy <85%, V30Gy <57%, V40Gy <38%, V50Gy <22%, and V60Gy <0.01%.

Methods and materials:   The first trial treated patients with high-risk prostate cancer to a dose of 40 Gy to the prostate and 25 Gy to the pelvis in 5 fractions. The second trial treated patients with intermediate-risk and high-risk prostate cancer to a dose of 35 Gy to the prostate, 25 Gy to the pelvis, and a DIL boost up to 50 Gy in 5 fractions.

Methods and materials:   Thirty-five patients undergoing definitive chemoradiation therapy (CRT) underwent longitudinal sampling (baseline and weeks 1, 3, and 5) of the gut microbiome and prospective assessment of patient-reported GI toxicity. DNA was isolated from stool obtained at rectal examination and analyzed with 16S rRNA sequencing. GI toxicity was assessed with the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite instrument to evaluate frequency, urgency, and discomfort associated with bowel function. Shannon diversity index was used to characterize alpha (within sample) diversity. Weighted UniFrac principle coordinates analysis was used to compare beta (between sample) diversity between samples using permutational multivariate analysis of variance. Linear discriminant analysis effect size highlighted microbial features that best distinguish categorized patient samples.  Results:   Gut microbiome diversity continuously decreased over the course of CRT, with the largest decrease at week 5. Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite bowel function scores also declined over the course of treatment, reflecting increased symptom burden. At all individual time points, higher diversity of the gut microbiome was linearly correlated with better patient-reported GI function, but baseline diversity was not predictive of eventual outcome. Patients with high toxicity demonstrated different compositional changes during CRT in addition to compositional differences in Clostridia species.

The recently published large randomized trial of ultrahypofractionated prostate cancer radiation therapy adds substantially to our current knowledge of dose response and fractionation sensitivity.  Methods and materials:   Randomized trials of dose escalation and hypofractionation of radiation therapy were meta-analyzed to yield the overall best estimate of the α/β ratio. Additionally, a putative saturation of dose effect previously reported at approximately 80 Gy EQD2 was investigated by mapping the relative effectiveness assessed at 5 years onto a single reference dose-response curve.  Results:   Meta-analysis of 14 randomized trials including 13,384 patients yielded a best estimate of α/β = 1.6 Gy (95% confidence interval, 1.3-2.0 Gy) but with highly significant heterogeneity (I2 = 70%, P = .0005). Further analysis indicated an association between increasing dose per fraction in the experimental arm and increasing α/β ratio (slope, 0.6 Gy increase in α/β per Gy increase in fraction size; P = .017). This deviation from the linear quadratic model could, however, also be explained by biochemical control maxing out at doses above approximately 80 Gy.  Conclusions:   Biochemical control data from randomized controlled trials of dose-per-fraction escalation in prostate cancer radiation therapy are inconsistent with the presence of a constant fractionation sensitivity in the linear-quadratic model and/or a monotonic dose response for biochemical control beyond 80 Gy equivalent dose. These observations have a potential effect on the optimal doses in future trials and the interpretation of ongoing trials of ultrahypofractionation.""","""['Ivan R Vogelius', 'Søren M Bentzen']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys""","""['Diminishing Returns From Ultrahypofractionated Radiation Therapy for Prostate Cancer In Regard to Vogelius et\xa0al.', 'In Reply to Berk and Alfonso.']"""

To gain more insight into these mechanisms, the ER stressor thapsigargin (Tg) is an instrumental experimental tool. Additionally, Tg forms the basis for analog prodrugs designed for cell killing in targeted cancer therapy. Tg induces apoptosis via the unfolded protein response (UPR), but how apoptosis is initiated, and how individual effects of the various UPR components are integrated, is unclear. Furthermore, the role of autophagy and autophagy-related (ATG) proteins remains elusive.  Methods:   To systematically address these key questions, we analyzed the effects of Tg and therapeutically relevant Tg analogs in two human cancer cell lines of different origin (LNCaP prostate- and HCT116 colon cancer cells), using RNAi and inhibitory drugs to target death receptors, UPR components and ATG proteins, in combination with measurements of cell death by fluorescence imaging and propidium iodide staining, as well as real-time RT-PCR and western blotting to monitor caspase activity, expression of ATG proteins, UPR components, and downstream ER stress signaling.  Results:   In both cell lines, Tg-induced cell death depended on death receptor 5 and caspase-8. Optimal cytotoxicity involved a non-autophagic function of MAP1LC3B upstream of procaspase-8 cleavage. PERK, ATF4 and CHOP were required for Tg-induced cell death, but surprisingly acted in parallel rather than as a linear pathway; ATF4 and CHOP were independently required for Tg-mediated upregulation of death receptor 5 and MAP1LC3B proteins, whereas PERK acted via other pathways. Interestingly, IRE1 contributed to Tg-induced cell death in a cell type-specific manner. This was linked to an XBP1-dependent activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase, which was pro-apoptotic in LNCaP but not HCT116 cells. Molecular requirements for cell death induction by therapy-relevant Tg analogs were identical to those observed with Tg.  Conclusions:   Together, our results provide a new, integrated understanding of UPR signaling mechanisms and downstream mediators that induce cell death upon Tg-triggered, unmitigated ER stress.

Previously, we showed that PRKAR2B, the type II-beta regulatory subunit of PKA, is highly expressed in castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) and can induce epithelial-mesenchymal transition by activating Wnt/β-catenin signaling in PCa cells. However, the molecular mechanism of dysregulated PRKAR2B expression pattern is still largely unknown. In this study, we found that the mutation, copy number alteration, and methylation status of PRKAR2B gene have no correlation with its expression level in PCa. Then, we identified two microRNAs (miR-200b-3p and miR-200c-3p) to be critical regulators of PRKAR2B expression in PCa. Notably, miR-200b-3p and miR-200c-3p expression were significantly downregulated in metastatic CRPC and negatively correlated with the expression level of PRKAR2B in PCa tissues. Moreover, we characterized X-Box Binding Protein 1 (XBP1) as a key transcription factor responsible for PRKAR2B expression in PCa. Importantly, miR-200b-3p/200c-3p or XBP1 knockdown inhibited PCa cell proliferation and promoted cell apoptosis and these inhibitory roles could be largely restored by PRKAR2B, suggesting that PRKAR2B is a functional mediator of miR-200b-3p, miR-200c-3p, and XBP1 in PCa.

Methods:   Experimental subjects were three prostate patients with bilateral hip prosthesis who had undergone radical radiotherapy. The treatment plans were five-field three-dimensional conformal radiation therapy (3D-CRT), fixed 5-field intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) using similar gantry angles, and single-arc volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT). The monitor units (MUs), dose volume histograms (DVHs), the dose indices of planning target volume (PTV), clinical target volume (CTV) and rectum were compared among the three techniques. The geometrical uncertainties were evaluated by shifting the iso-center (2- 10 mm in the anterior, posterior, left, right, superior, and inferior directions). The CTV and rectum dose indexes with and without the iso-center shifts were compared in each plan.  Results:   The Conformity Index of PTV were 1.35 in 3D-CRT, 1.12 in IMRT, and 1.04 in VMAT, respectively. The rectum doses in 3D-CRT are also higher than those in IMRT and VMAT. The iso-center shift little affected the CTV dose when smaller than the margin size. The rectum dose increased especially after a posterior shift. Additionally, this dose increase was larger in the VMAT plan than in the 3D- CRT plan. However, the VMAT achieved a superior rectum DVH to that of 3D- CRT, and this effect clearly exceeded the rectum-dose increase elicited by the iso-center shift.  Conclusion:   For radiotherapy treatment of localized prostate cancer in patients with hip prosthesis, the dose distribution was better in the VMAT and Metal Artifact Reduction (MAR)-CT image methods than the conventional methods. Because the anatomical structure of the male pelvic region is relatively constant among individuals, we consider that VMAT is a valid treatment plan despite analyzing just three cases.""","""['Rikana Soda', 'Shogo Hatanaka', 'Masatsugu Hariu', 'Munefumi Shimbo', 'Takafumi Yamano', 'Keiichiro Nishimura', 'Shuichi Kondo', 'Nobuko Utsumi', 'Takeo Takahashi']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""J Xray Sci Technol""","""['Evaluation of 3D-CRT, IMRT and VMAT radiotherapy plans for left breast cancer based on clinical dosimetric study.', 'Volumetric modulated arc therapy for delivery of prostate radiotherapy: comparison with intensity-modulated radiotherapy and three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy.', 'Volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) vs. serial tomotherapy, step-and-shoot IMRT and 3D-conformal RT for treatment of prostate cancer.', 'IMRT for prostate cancer: defining target volume based on correlated pathologic volume of disease.', 'Current status of intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT).', 'Carbon-Ion Radiotherapy Using Metal Artifact Reduction Computed Tomography in a Patient with Prostate Cancer with Bilateral Hip Prostheses: A Case Report.', 'Planning issues on linac-based stereotactic radiotherapy.', 'Effect of dental metal artifact conversion volume on dose distribution in head-and-neck volumetric-modulated arc therapy.']"""

However, most current studies are concentrated on single-needle detection by only using a small number of images with a needle, regardless of the massive database of US images without needles. In this paper, we propose a workflow for multi-needle detection by considering the images without needles as auxiliary. Concretely, we train position-specific dictionaries on 3D overlapping patches of auxiliary images, where we develop an enhanced sparse dictionary learning method by integrating spatial continuity of 3D US, dubbed order-graph regularized dictionary learning. Using the learned dictionaries, target images are reconstructed to obtain residual pixels which are then clustered in every slice to yield centers. With the obtained centers, regions of interest (ROIs) are constructed via seeking cylinders. Finally, we detect needles by using the random sample consensus algorithm per ROI and then locate the tips by finding the sharp intensity drops along the detected axis for every needle. Extensive experiments were conducted on a phantom dataset and a prostate dataset of 70/21 patients without/with needles. Visualization and quantitative results show the effectiveness of our proposed workflow. Specifically, our method can correctly detect 95% of needles with a tip location error of 1.01 mm on the prostate dataset.

Methods:   Caspase-3 and p38MAPK gene expression and intracellular protein levels were determined. Matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP2) gelatinase activity and caspase-3 enzyme activity were measured and PC3 cell migration and proliferation potencies were assessed.  Results:   Genistein induced apoptosis by enhancing the gene expression, intracellular protein level, and enzyme activity of caspase-3. Genistein also inhibited cell proliferation by reducing p38MAPK gene expression and protein level and strongly suppressed metastatic potency of PC3 cells by reducing MMP2 activity.

Amplification of KDM5A is observed in many cancers, including breast cancer, prostate cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, lung cancer, and gastric cancer. In this study, we employed alanine scanning mutagenesis to investigate substrate recognition of KDM5A and identify the H3 tail residues necessary for KDM5A-catalyzed demethylation. Our data show that the H3Q5 residue is critical for substrate recognition by KDM5A. Our data also reveal that the protein-protein interactions between KDM5A and the histone H3 tail extend beyond the amino acids proximal to the substrate mark. Specifically, demethylation activity assays show that deletion or mutation of residues at positions 14-18 on the H3 tail results in an 8-fold increase in the KMapp, compared to wild-type 18mer peptide, suggesting that this distal epitope is important in histone engagement. Finally, we demonstrate that post-translational modifications on this distal epitope can modulate KDM5A-dependent demethylation.

For example, cardiovascular disease death is a competing event for prostate cancer death because an individual cannot die of prostate cancer once he has died of cardiovascular disease. Various statistical estimands have been defined as possible targets of inference in the classical competing risks literature. Many reviews have described these statistical estimands and their estimating procedures with recommendations about their use. However, this previous work has not used a formal framework for characterizing causal effects and their identifying conditions, which makes it difficult to interpret effect estimates and assess recommendations regarding analytic choices. Here we use a counterfactual framework to explicitly define each of these classical estimands. We clarify that, depending on whether competing events are defined as censoring events, contrasts of risks can define a total effect of the treatment on the event of interest or a direct effect of the treatment on the event of interest not mediated by the competing event. In contrast, regardless of whether competing events are defined as censoring events, counterfactual hazard contrasts cannot generally be interpreted as causal effects. We illustrate how identifying assumptions for all of these counterfactual estimands can be represented in causal diagrams, in which competing events are depicted as time-varying covariates.

The authors hypothesized that receiving care through the Veterans Affairs (VA) health system, an equal-access medical system, would attenuate this disparity.  Methods:   A longitudinal, centralized database of >20 million veterans was used to assemble a cohort of 60,035 men (18,201 AA men [30.3%] and 41,834 NHW men [69.7%]) who were diagnosed with PC between 2000 and 2015.  Results:   AA men were more likely to live in regions with a lower median income ($40,871 for AA men vs $48,125 for NHW men; P < .001) and lower high school graduation rates (83% for AA men vs 88% for NHW men; P < .001). At the time of diagnosis, AA men were younger (median age, 63.0 years vs 66.0 years; P < .001) and had a higher prostate-specific antigen level (median, 6.7 ng/mL vs 6.2 ng/mL; P < .001), but were less likely to have Gleason score 8 to 10 disease (18.8% among AA men vs 19.7% among NHW men; P < .001), a clinical T classification ≥3 (2.2% vs 2.9%; P < .001), or distant metastatic disease (2.7% vs 3.1%; P = 0.01). The 10-year PC-specific mortality rate was slightly lower for AA men (4.4% vs 5.1%; P = .005), which was confirmed in multivariable competing-risk analysis (subdistribution hazard ratio, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.78-0.93; P < .001).

All breast and prostate cancer patients undergoing curative radiotherapy during 2015 were screened (n=806). Patient's self-evaluation of asthenia and radiotherapy tolerance was assessed through verbal analogic scale (0/10 to 10/10). Data about toxicities, travel distance and travel time, tumor's characteristics, radiotherapy treatment planning, previous cancer therapies, were collected from medical records.  Results:   500 patients were included (350 in the breast cancer group and 150 in the prostate cancer group). In all, 86% of patients in the breast cancer group reported asthenia, with a 5/10 median score. In all, 54% of patients in the prostate cancer group reported asthenia, with a 2/10 median score. Univariate analysis showed correlation between asthenia and radiotherapy tolerance as well as tumor staging, in the prostate cancer group. No other correlation was evidenced.

Materials and methods:   From January 2018 to April 2019, a total of 112 patients underwent TRUS-Bx due to elevated prostate-specific antigen (PSA) or abnormal digital rectal examination findings. Patients were divided into 2 groups depending on whether they received pharmacological treatment before biopsy. Group 1 consisted of patients with no alpha-blocker treatment prior to biopsy and Group 2 consisted of patients who received Tamsulosin for one week before biopsy continuing for one week after biopsy. Voiding function was evaluated three times using the validated International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) and uroflowmetry (maximal flow rate (Qmax) and residual volume (PVR)). The Turkish version of the Medical Outcomes Study Short Form 36-item Questionnaire (SF-36) was used to assess health-related quality of life. Pain scores were rated according to the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) just after the biopsy procedure.  Results:   Mean IPSS and Qmax on the post-biopsy 7 day were significantly in favor of Group 2 (P<0.001, P=0.004). Although post-biopsy day 7 PVR was similar between the groups, Δ1 PVR was significantly in favor of Group 2 (P=0.004).

An ideal approach would be fully compatible with downstream analytic methods, such as advanced genomic testing. These endpoints necessitate the use of live cells at high purity. A multitude of microfluidic circulating tumor cell (CTC) enrichment technologies exist, but many of those perform bulk sample enrichment and are not, on their own, capable of single-cell interrogation. To address this, we developed an affordable semiautomated single-cell aspirator (SASCA) to further enrich rare-cell populations from a specialized microwell array, per their phenotypic markers. Immobilization of cells within microwells, integrated with a real-time image processing software, facilitates the detection and precise isolation of targeted cells that have been optimally seeded into the microwells. Here, we demonstrate the platform capabilities through the aspiration of target cells from an impure background population, where we obtain purity levels of 90%-100% and demonstrate the enrichment of the target population with high-quality RNA extraction. A range of low cell numbers were aspirated using SASCA before undergoing whole transcriptome and genome analysis, exhibiting the ability to obtain endpoints from low-template inputs. Lastly, CTCs from patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer were isolated with this platform and the utility of this method was confirmed for rare-cell isolation. SASCA satisfies a need for an affordable option to isolate single cells or highly purified subpopulations of cells to probe complex mechanisms driving disease progression and resistance in patients with cancer.""","""['Jacob J Tokar', 'Charlotte N Stahlfeld', 'Jamie M Sperger', 'David J Niles', 'David J Beebe', 'Joshua M Lang', 'Jay W Warrick']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""SLAS Technol""","""['Implementing microwell slides for detection and isolation of single circulating tumor cells from complex cell suspensions.', 'An integrated enrichment system to facilitate isolation and molecular characterization of single cancer cells from whole blood.', 'An Integrated Microfluidic Chip and Its Clinical Application for Circulating Tumor Cell Isolation and Single-Cell Analysis.', 'DEPArray™ system: An automatic image-based sorter for isolation of pure circulating tumor cells.', 'Microfluidics and circulating tumor cells.', 'Reversible epigenetic alterations regulate class I HLA loss in prostate cancer.', 'Timelapse viability assay to detect division and death of primary multiple myeloma cells in response to drug treatments with single cell resolution.', 'SEEMLIS: a flexible semi-automated method for enrichment of methylated DNA from low-input samples.']"""
