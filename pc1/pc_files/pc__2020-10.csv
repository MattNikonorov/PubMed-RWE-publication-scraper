Methods:   Transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) image volumes from 1102 treatments were used to create a clinical ground truth (CGT) including 24422 individual needles that had been manually digitized by medical physicists during brachytherapy procedures. A 3D CNN U-net with 128 × 128 × 128 TRUS image volumes as input was trained using 17215 needle examples. Predictions of voxels constituting a needle were combined to yield a 3D linear function describing the localization of each needle in a TRUS volume. Manual and AI digitizations were compared in terms of the root-mean-square distance (RMSD) along each needle, expressed as median and interquartile range (IQR). The method was evaluated on a data set including 7207 needle examples. A subgroup of the evaluation data set (n = 188) was created, where the needles were digitized once more by a medical physicist (G1) trained in brachytherapy. The digitization procedure was timed.  Results:   The RMSD between the AI and CGT was 0.55 (IQR: 0.35-0.86) mm. In the smaller subset, the RMSD between AI and CGT was similar (0.52 [IQR: 0.33-0.79] mm) but significantly smaller (P < 0.001) than the difference of 0.75 (IQR: 0.49-1.20) mm between AI and G1. The difference between CGT and G1 was 0.80 (IQR: 0.48-1.18) mm, implying that the AI performed as well as the CGT in relation to G1. The mean time needed for human digitization was 10 min 11 sec, while the time needed for the AI was negligible.  Conclusions:   A 3D CNN can be trained to identify needles in TRUS images. The performance of the network was similar to that of a medical physicist trained in brachytherapy. Incorporating a CNN for needle identification can shorten brachytherapy treatment procedures substantially.""","""['Christoffer Andersén', 'Tobias Rydén', 'Per Thunberg', 'Jakob H Lagerlöf']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Multi-needle Localization with Attention U-Net in US-guided HDR Prostate Brachytherapy.', 'Automatic prostate segmentation using deep learning on clinically diverse 3D transrectal ultrasound images.', 'Automatic multi-needle localization in ultrasound images using large margin mask RCNN for ultrasound-guided prostate brachytherapy.', 'Use of three-dimensional radiation therapy planning tools and intraoperative ultrasound to evaluate high dose rate prostate brachytherapy implants.', 'Clinical evaluation of an MRI-to-ultrasound deformable image registration algorithm for prostate brachytherapy.', 'Bridging the simulation-to-real gap for AI-based needle and target detection in robot-assisted ultrasound-guided interventions.', 'Deep-learning-assisted algorithm for catheter reconstruction during MR-only gynecological interstitial brachytherapy.']"""

In this study, a deep learning-based approach was developed for automatic intraprostatic lesion segmentation in multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) images contributing to clinical practice.  Methods:   Multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging images from 136 patient cases were collected from our institution, and all these cases contained suspicious lesions with Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) score ≥ 4. The contours of the lesion and prostate were manually created on axial T2-weighted (T2W), apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and high b-value diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) images to provide the ground truth data. Then a multiple branch UNet (MB-UNet) was proposed for the segmentation of an indistinct target in multi-modality MRI images. An encoder module was designed with three branches for the three MRI modalities separately, to fully extract the high-level features provided by different MRI modalities; an input module was added by using three sub-branches for three consecutive image slices, to consider the contour consistency among different image slices; deep supervision strategy was also integrated into the network to speed up the convergency of the network and improve the performance. The probability maps of the background, normal prostate and lesion were output by the network to generate the segmentation of the lesion, and the performance was evaluated using the dice similarity coefficient (DSC) as the main metric.  Results:   A total of 162 lesions were contoured on 652 image slices, with 119 lesions in the peripheral zone, 38 in the transition zone, four in the central zone and one in the anterior fibromuscular stroma. All prostates were also contoured on 1,264 image slices. As for the segmentation of lesions in the testing set, MB-UNet achieved a per case DSC of 0.6333, specificity of 0.9993, sensitivity of 0.7056; and global DSC of 0.7205, specificity of 0.9993, sensitivity of 0.7409. All the three deep learning strategies adopted in this study contributed to the performance promotion of the MB-UNet. Missing the DWI modality would degrade the segmentation performance more markedly compared with the other two modalities.  Conclusions:   A deep learning-based approach with proposed MB-UNet was developed to automatically segment suspicious lesions in mpMRI images. This study makes it feasible to adopt boosting intraprostatic lesions in clinical practice to achieve better outcomes.""","""['Yizheng Chen', 'Lei Xing', 'Lequan Yu', 'Hilary P Bagshaw', 'Mark K Buyyounouski', 'Bin Han']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Semi-automatic classification of prostate cancer on multi-parametric MR imaging using a multi-channel 3D convolutional neural network.', 'Autosegmentation of Prostate Zones and Cancer Regions from Biparametric Magnetic Resonance Images by Using Deep-Learning-Based Neural Networks.', 'Automated deep learning method for whole-breast segmentation in diffusion-weighted breast MRI.', 'Prostate imaging reporting and data system version 2 (PI-RADS v2): a pictorial review.', 'Review of Semantic Segmentation of Medical Images Using Modified Architectures of UNET.', 'Research progress on deep learning in magnetic resonance imaging-based diagnosis and treatment of prostate cancer: a review on the current status and perspectives.', 'A novel approach for automatic segmentation of prostate and its lesion regions on magnetic resonance imaging.', 'Deep Learning-Based Abdominal Muscle Segmentation on CT Images of Surgical Patient Populations.', 'Joint Cancer Segmentation and PI-RADS Classification on Multiparametric MRI Using MiniSegCaps Network.', 'Current Value of Biparametric Prostate MRI with Machine-Learning or Deep-Learning in the Detection, Grading, and Characterization of Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Review.']"""

Study design and setting:   All Delphi surveys were conducted online using DelphiManager software and included healthcare professionals and participating patients. Participants were invited to give a free-text reason whenever they changed their score across an important threshold on a 1-9 Likert scale (1-3 not important, 4-5 important, 7-9 critically important). Reasons for score change were coded by four researchers independently using an inductive-iterative approach.  Results:   In all three Delphi surveys, the number of outcomes reaching criteria for consensus was greater in R2 than R1. Twelve themes and 23 subthemes emerged from 2298 discrete reasons given for score change. The most common reasons for the change were ""time to reflect"" (482 responses, 23%) and vicarious thinking (424, 21%), with 68% (291) of vicarious thinking attributed to seeing other participant's scores.  Conclusion:   Our findings support conducting a Delphi survey over the use of a single questionnaire where building consensus is the objective. Time to reflect and vicarious thinking, facilitated by seeing other participant's scores, were important drivers of score change.

Previous analysis, at median follow up of 85 months, demonstrated improved relapse free survival (RFS) with EBRT + HDR-BTb. This data has now been updated with a median follow up of 131 months.  Materials and methods:   From December 1997 to August 2005, patients were assigned either to EBRT alone delivering 55 Gy in 20 fractions over 4 weeks or EBRT followed by a temporary high-dose-rate implant delivering 2 × 8·5 Gy over 24 h. The primary endpoint was RFS defined by a PSA rise ≥2.0 µg/l above nadir, clinical progression or death. Actuarial survival rates and Hazard Ratios (HRs) were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method and Cox's Proportional Hazard Model, respectively. Secondary endpoints were overall survival (OS), urinary and bowel toxicity.  Results:   One hundred and six patients received EBRT alone and 110 EBRT + HDR-BTb. Median time to relapse was 137 months in the HDR-BTb arm compared to 82 months for EBRT alone (p = 0·01). A 27% risk of recurrence with EBRT alone was observed (p = 0·001), resulting in a 21% improvement in RFS at 12 years with EBRT + HDR-BTb. In multivariate analysis treatment arm, risk category and no androgen deprivation therapy were significant covariates for risk of relapse. Differences in overall survival were not significant.

The aim of this study is to demonstrate the prognostic value of these markers, as well as other clinical and analytical variables in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC).  Material and methods:   Prospective cohort study carried out on 80 patients diagnosed with mCRPC. Clinical and analytical data were collected, and the following inflammatory markers were estimated: Absolute Neutrophil Count (ANC), Neutrophil-Lymphocyte Ratio (NLR), Total Platelet Count (TPC), Platelet-Lymphocyte Ratio (PLR), Lymphocyte-Monocyte Ratio (LMR) and Systemic Inflammation Index (SII). The values of albumin, hemoglobin (Hb), alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) were also determined.  Results:   Patients with ANC>7500, NLR>3, PLR>150, LMR>3 and/or SII>535,000, presented significantly lower median survival time than the remaining patients, and TPC was the only marker which did not show a significant association. Moreover, NLR, PLR and SII were inversely correlated with survival time. Patients with hypoalbuminemia, anemia, and elevated LDH values had significantly lower median survival time. Albumin and hemoglobin were directly correlated to overall survival time. The need for analgesia was also associated with shorter survival.

However, changes in PSA in patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) are used to inform treatment decisions.  Objective:   To determine whether the Prostate Cancer Working Group 2 (PCWG2) definition of PSA progression is adequate to predict radiographic or clinical progression in enzalutamide-treated men with nonmetastatic CRPC (nmCRPC).  Design, setting, and participants:   A post hoc, retrospective analysis of men with nmCRPC from PROSPER (NCT02003924) was performed.  Intervention:   Continued androgen deprivation therapy; patients randomized 2:1 to enzalutamide 160 mg/d or placebo.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Metastasis-free survival (MFS) in men with and without PSA progression, defined by PCWG2, and PSA at the time of radiographic progression were assessed.  Results and limitations:   As of June 28, 2017, in enzalutamide-treated patients, the risk of metastasis or death was increased significantly in those with PSA progression versus those without (hazard ratio [HR] 3.99; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.95-5.41; p < 0.0001). Median MFS was not reached (NR; 95% CI, NR-NR) in patients without PSA progression and was 22.6 mo (95% CI, 21.9-29.0) in those with PSA progression. In placebo-treated patients, PSA progression was not significantly associated with MFS (HR 1.72; 95% CI, 0.86-3.45; p = 0.1). Median MFS was NR (95% CI, 25.6-NR) in patients without PSA progression and 18.3 mo (95% CI, 14.9-19.4) in those with PSA progression. The median PSA increase from nadir at the time of radiographic progression was 1.4 ng/mL in enzalutamide-treated men and 25.6 ng/mL for the placebo arm.  Conclusions:   In men with nmCRPC and rapidly rising PSA, radiographic progression often occurred without PCWG2-defined PSA progression, suggesting that any increase in PSA may warrant closer monitoring. While PCWG2-defined PSA progression was associated with radiographic progression in enzalutamide-treated men, our findings argue for prospective re-evaluation of this threshold.  Patient summary:   In this report, we looked at changes in prostate-specific antigen (PSA) in enzalutamide-treated men with nonmetastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer who no longer respond to testosterone-lowering treatment. We found that even very small changes in PSA while on treatment could be an early indication of disease progression and should trigger closer monitoring.""","""['Fred Saad', 'Cora N Sternberg', 'Eleni Efstathiou', 'Karim Fizazi', 'Katharina Modelska', 'Xun Lin', 'Jennifer Sugg', 'Joyce Steinberg', 'Bettina Noerby', 'Neal D Shore', 'Maha Hussain']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Eur Urol""","""['Does One Size Fit All?

Eliminating CAFs or reducing their tumor-promoting activity is beneficial for tumor immunotherapy. Curcumin is a natural polyphenol derived from turmeric, which has been shown to inhibit the growth of many types of tumor. In this study, we explored the effect of curcumin on prostate-CAFs and its underlying molecular mechanism. The effect of curcumin on CAFs was measured using MTT assay and plate colony formation assay. Flow cytometry was used to detect cell apoptosis, ROS, Cell cycle, and mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm) changes after curcumin treatment. Western Blot was used to detect changes in expression levels of related proteins in CAFs after curcumin stimulation. Colorimetry was used to detect the change of caspase 3 activity. The mRNA levels of Bims, Puma, ATF4 and CHOP were determined by qRT-PCR. We found that curcumin induced the apoptosis and cell cycle arrest of CAFs, which is mainly caused by the ROS-mediated endoplasmic reticulum stress pathway. For mechanism, the up-regulation of ROS caused by curcumin triggers endoplasmic reticulum stress of CAFs through the PERK-eIF2α-ATF4 axis. Our study suggests that curcumin selectively inhibits prostate-CAFs by inducing apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in G2-M phase, indicating a novel application of curcumin in tumor therapy.""","""['Yanqiong Zeng', 'Qingdi Du', 'Zhiwei Zhang', 'Jing Ma', 'Le Han', 'Yuanyuan Wang', 'Linpu Yang', 'Ning Tao', 'Zhihai Qin']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Arch Biochem Biophys""","""['Curcumin analog WZ35 induced cell death via ROS-dependent ER stress and G2/M cell cycle arrest in human prostate cancer cells.', 'Curcumin analog L48H37 induces apoptosis through ROS-mediated endoplasmic reticulum stress and STAT3 pathways in human lung cancer cells.', 'Curcumin enhances the effects of irinotecan on colorectal cancer cells through the generation of reactive oxygen species and activation of the endoplasmic reticulum stress pathway.', 'Curcumin, a Multifaceted Hormetic Agent, Mediates an Intricate Crosstalk between Mitochondrial Turnover, Autophagy, and Apoptosis.', 'Curcumin and its derivatives in cancer therapy: Potentiating antitumor activity of cisplatin and reducing side effects.', 'Curcumin derived from medicinal homologous foods: its main signals in immunoregulation of oxidative stress, inflammation, and apoptosis.', 'Curcumin activates a ROS/KEAP1/NRF2/miR-34a/b/c cascade to suppress colorectal cancer metastasis.', 'Pharmacological Mechanisms and Clinical Applications of Curcumin: Update.', 'Nano-Based Drug Delivery of Polyphenolic Compounds for Cancer Treatment: Progress, Opportunities, and Challenges.', 'Remodeling tumor microenvironment with natural products to overcome drug resistance.']"""

We aimed to develop an evidence-based consensus definition of aggressive prostate cancer using clinical features at diagnosis for etiologic epidemiologic research.  Methods:   Among prostate cancer cases diagnosed in 2007 in the National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-18 database with follow-up through 2017, we compared the performance of categorizations of aggressive prostate cancer in discriminating fatal prostate cancer within 10 years of diagnosis, placing the most emphasis on sensitivity and positive predictive value (PPV).  Results:   In our case population (n = 55 900), 3073 men died of prostate cancer within 10 years. Among 12 definitions that included TNM staging and Gleason score, sensitivities ranged from 0.64 to 0.89 and PPVs ranged from 0.09 to 0.23. We propose defining aggressive prostate cancer as diagnosis of category T4 or N1 or M1 or Gleason score of 8 or greater prostate cancer, because this definition had one of the higher PPVs (0.23, 95% confidence interval = 0.22 to 0.24) and reasonable sensitivity (0.66, 95% confidence interval = 0.64 to 0.67) for prostate cancer death within 10 years. Results were similar across sensitivity analyses.  Conclusions:   We recommend that etiologic epidemiologic studies of prostate cancer report results for this definition of aggressive prostate cancer. We also recommend that studies separately report results for advanced category (T4 or N1 or M1), high-grade (Gleason score ≥8), and fatal prostate cancer. Use of this comprehensive set of endpoints will facilitate comparison of results from different studies and help elucidate prostate cancer etiology.""","""['Lauren M Hurwitz', 'Ilir Agalliu', 'Demetrius Albanes', 'Kathryn Hughes Barry', 'Sonja I Berndt', 'Qiuyin Cai', 'Chu Chen', 'Iona Cheng', 'Jeanine M Genkinger', 'Graham G Giles', 'Jiaqi Huang', 'Corinne E Joshu', 'Tim J Key', 'Synnove Knutsen', 'Stella Koutros', 'Hilde Langseth', 'Sherly X Li', 'Robert J MacInnis', 'Sarah C Markt', 'Kathryn L Penney', 'Aurora Perez-Cornago', 'Thomas E Rohan', 'Stephanie A Smith-Warner', 'Meir J Stampfer', 'Konrad H Stopsack', 'Catherine M Tangen', 'Ruth C Travis', 'Stephanie J Weinstein', 'Wu Lang PhD', 'Eric J Jacobs', 'Lorelei A Mucci', 'Elizabeth A Platz', 'Michael B Cook;Prostate Cancer Cohort Consortium (PC) Working Group']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""J Natl Cancer Inst""","""['Erratum to: Recommended Definitions of Aggressive Prostate Cancer for Etiologic Epidemiologic Research.', 'Applying recommended definition of aggressive prostate cancer: a validation study using high-quality data from the Cancer Registry of Norway.', 'Incidence and Predictors of Upgrading and Up Staging among 10,000 Contemporary Patients with Low Risk Prostate Cancer.', 'Evaluation of an Aggressive Prostate Biopsy Strategy in Men Younger than 50 Years.', 'An evidence review of active surveillance in men with localized prostate cancer.', 'The 2014 International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) Consensus Conference on Gleason Grading of Prostatic Carcinoma: Definition of Grading Patterns and Proposal for a New Grading System.', 'Neighbourhood social deprivation and risk of prostate cancer.', 'Prediagnostic markers of insulin resistance and prostate cancer risk and death: A pooled study.', 'A prospective nested case-control study of serum concentrations of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances and aggressive prostate cancer risk.', 'Long-Term Exposure to Nitrate and Trihalomethanes in Drinking Water and Prostate Cancer: A Multicase-Control Study in Spain (MCC-Spain).', 'Night shift work and risk of aggressive prostate cancer in the Norwegian Offshore Petroleum Workers (NOPW) cohort.']"""

Although it is well established that PHF8 can enhance prostate cancer cell proliferation, whether PHF8 is involved in prostate cancer initiation and progression is relatively unclear. By comparing the transgenic adenocarcinoma of the mouse prostate (TRAMP) mice with or without Phf8 knockout, we systemically examined the role of PHF8 in prostate cancer development. We found that PHF8 plays a minimum role in initiation and progression of adenocarcinoma. However, PHF8 is essential for NEPC because not only is PHF8 highly expressed in NEPC but also animals without Phf8 failed to develop NEPC. Mechanistically, PHF8 transcriptionally upregulates FOXA2 by demethylating and removing the repressive histone markers on the promoter region of the FOXA2 gene, and the upregulated FOXA2 subsequently regulates the expression of genes involved in NEPC development. Since both PHF8 and FOXA2 are highly expressed in NEPC tissues from patients or patient-derived xenografts, the levels of PHF8 and FOXA2 can either individually or in combination serve as NEPC biomarkers and targeting either PHF8 or FOXA2 could be potential therapeutic strategies for NEPC treatment. © 2020 The Authors.

Non-invasive approaches for molecular monitoring of disease are urgently needed, especially for patients suffering from bone metastases for whom tissue biopsy is challenging. Here we utilized baseline blood samples to identify mCRPC patients most likely to benefit from abiraterone plus prednisone (AAP) or enzalutamide.  Methods:   Baseline blood samples were collected for circulating tumor cell (CTC) enumeration and qPCR-based gene expression analysis from 51 men with mCRPC beginning treatment with abiraterone or enzalutamide.  Results:   Of 51 patients (median age 68 years [51-82]), 22 received AAP (abiraterone 1000 mg/day plus prednisone 10 mg/day) and 29 received enzalutamide (160 mg/day). The cohort was randomly divided into training (n = 37) and test (n = 14) sets. Baseline clinical variables (Gleason score, PSA, testosterone, and hemoglobin), CTC count, and qPCR-based gene expression data for 141 genes/isoforms in CTC-enriched blood were analyzed with respect to overall survival (OS). Genes with expression most associated with OS included MSLN, ARG2, FGF8, KLK3, ESRP2, NPR3, CCND1, and WNT5A. Using a Cox-elastic net model for our test set, the 8-gene expression signature had a c-index of 0.87 (95% CI [0.80, 0.94]) and was more strongly associated with OS than clinical variables or CTC count alone, or a combination of the three variables. For patients with a low-risk vs. high-risk gene expression signature, median OS was not reached vs. 18 months, respectively (HR 5.32 [1.91-14.80], p = 0.001).

Although the prostate basal cells have been shown to directly generate tumor cells with neuroendocrine features when transduced with oncogenic signaling, the identity of the cell-of-origin for de novo NEPC remains unclear. We show that the TACSTD2high human prostate luminal epithelia cells highly express SOX2 and are relatively enriched in the transition zone prostate. Both TACSTD2high and TACSTD2low luminal cells transduced by constitutively activated AKT1 (caAKT1), and c-Myc can form organoids containing versatile clinically relevant tumor cell lineages with regard to the expression of AR and the neuroendocrine cell markers Synaptophysin and Chromogranin A. Tumor organoid cells derived from the TACSTD2high luminal cells are more predisposed to neuroendocrine differentiation along passaging and are relatively more castration-resistant. Knocking down TACSTD2 and SOX2 both attenuate neuroendocrine differentiation of tumor organoid cells.

Methods:   Fourteen ADT-treated obese PCa patients (72 ± 9 yr, 39.7% ± 5.4% body fat) were recruited for a self-controlled prospective study, with 11 completing the 6-wk control period, followed by a 12-wk intervention comprising 300 min·wk-1 of exercise including supervised resistance training and home-based aerobic exercise, and dietitian consultations advising a daily energy deficit (2100-4200 kJ) and protein supplementation. Body composition was assessed by dual x-ray absorptiometry. Secondary outcomes included muscle strength (one-repetition maximum), cardiorespiratory fitness (maximal oxygen consumption), and blood biomarkers.  Results:   There were no significant changes during the control period. Patients attended 89% of supervised exercise sessions and 100% of dietitian consultations. No changes in physical activity or energy intake were observed. During the intervention, patients experienced significant reductions in weight (-2.8 ± 3.2 kg, P = 0.016), FM (-2.8 ± 2.6 kg, P < 0.001), and trunk FM (-1.8 ± 1.4 kg, P < 0.001), with LM preserved (-0.05 ± 1.6 kg, P = 0.805). Muscle strength (4.6%-24.7%, P < 0.010) and maximal oxygen consumption (3.5 ± 4.7 mL·min-1·kg-1, P = 0.041) significantly improved. Leptin significantly decreased (-2.2 (-2.7 to 0.5) ng·mL-1, P = 0.016) with no other changes in blood biomarkers such as testosterone and lipids (P = 0.051-0.765); however, C-reactive protein (rs = -0.670, P = 0.024) and triglycerides (r = -0.667, P = 0.025) were associated with individual changes in LM.  Conclusions:   This study shows preliminary efficacy for an exercise and nutrition weight loss intervention to reduce FM, maintain LM, and improve muscle strength and cardiorespiratory fitness in ADT-treated obese PCa patients.

Here, we present the first-to our knowledge-clinical data for PSMA-targeted α-therapy (TAT) using 225Ac-PSMA imaging and therapy (I&T). Methods: Fourteen patients receiving 225Ac-PSMA-I&T were included in this retrospective analysis. Eleven of the 14 had prior second-line antiandrogen treatment with abiraterone or enzalutamide, prior chemotherapy, and prior 177Lu-PSMA treatment. Patients were treated at bimonthly intervals until progression or intolerable side effects. Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) was measured for response assessment. Hematologic and nonhematologic side effects were recorded according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 5.0. Results: Thirty-four cycles of 225Ac-PSMA-I&T were applied (median dose, 7.8 MBq; range, 6.0-8.5), with 1 cycle in 3 patients, 2 cycles in 7 patients, 4 cycles in 3 patients, and 5 cycles in 1 patient. No acute toxicity was observed during hospitalization. Baseline PSA was 112 ng/mL (range, 20.5-818 ng/mL). The best PSA response after TAT (a PSA decline ≥ 50%) was observed in 7 patients, and a PSA decline of any amount was observed in 11 patients. Three patients had no PSA decline at any time. A subgroup analysis of 11 patients with prior 177Lu-PSMA treatment showed any PSA decline in 8 patients and a decline of at least 50% in 5 patients. After TAT, grade 3 anemia was observed in 3 of the 14 patients, with 2 of them presenting with grade 2 anemia already at baseline. Grade 3 leukopenia was observed in 1 patient. Eight patients with preexisting xerostomia after 177Lu-PSMA showed no worsening after TAT. Newly diagnosed grade 1 or 2 xerostomia after TAT was observed in 5 patients. One patient reported no xerostomia at all.

Methods and materials:   A total of 95 patients received 15 Gy HDR BT boost. The procedure involved transrectal ultrasound-based catheter insertion and planning in the OR, after which the patient was moved to a shielded treatment room for radiation.

For all patients, the 5- and 10-year FFS rates were 80.0% (95% CI: 74.7-85.7%) and 63.5% (95% CI 55.4-72.8%). The failure rates for the intermediate, high-risk, locally advanced, and N1 groups were 6.1%, 13.0%, 18.4%, and 35.7%, respectively (P = 0.003). Overall, 5- and 10-year PCSS rates were 95.7% (95% CI 93.0-98.5%) and 88.2% (95% CI 82.8-93.8%). Prostate cancer-specific mortality rates for the high-risk, locally advanced, and N1 groups were 4.0%, 8.2%, and 23.8%, respectively (P < 0.001). Overall, 5- and 10-year actuarial OS rates were 92.4% (95% CI 88.8-96.1%) and 72.7% (95% CI 64.8-81.5%). High level prostate-specific antigen and positive N stage were significantly associated with worse FFS (P < 0.05). Advanced T stage and positive N stage emerged as worse predictors of PCSS (P < 0.05). Advanced age, T stage, and positive N stage were the only factors that were significantly associated with worse OS (P < 0.05). The 5-year cumulative incidence rate of grade ≥ 2 late GU and GI toxicity was 17.8% (95% CI 12.5-22.7%) and 23.4% (95% CI 17.7-28.7%), respectively.  Conclusions:   Moderately hypofractionated radiotherapy (67.5 Gy in 25 fractions) for this predominantly high-risk, locally advanced, or N1 in Chinese patients demonstrates encouraging long-term outcomes and acceptable toxicity.

Methods:   From June 2009 to September 2016, 756 patients diagnosed with localized prostate cancer who had undergone RRP, LRP or RALP in our center were included in this study. Patients with PIH were retrospectively investigated in such factors as age, BMI, previous abdominal operations, diabetes mellitus history, hypertension history, prostate volume, previous hernia, operative methods, operative approach, preoperative Gleason, clinical T-stage, PLND situation, operative time, and estimated blood loss. Univariate and multivariate cox hazard regressions analysis were utilized to identify risk factors predisposing to PIH.  Results:   A total of 53 of 751(7.1%) patients developed PIH at a median follow-up period of 43 months. PIH rate in RRP was significantly higher compared to LRP and RALP group (RRP: 15.3%, LRP: 6.7%, RALP:1.9%, P = 0.038). Right side (69.8%) and indirect (88.8%) PIH were dominant type in hernia group. Univariate and multivariate cox hazard regressions analysis indicated that age and RRP approach were identified to be implicated to PIH [adjusted hazard ratio7.39(1.18-46.39), 2.93(95% CI 1.47-5.84)].

The genetic heritability of developing radiotoxicity and prior role of genetic variants as being associated with side-effects of radiotherapy necessitates further investigation for underlying molecular mechanisms. In this study, we investigated gene expression regulated by genetic variants, and copy number variation in prostate cancer survivors with radiotoxicity.  Methods:   We investigated proctitis as a radiotoxic endpoint in prostate cancer patients who received radiotherapy (n = 222). We analyzed the copy number variation and genetically regulated gene expression profiles of whole-blood and prostate tissue associated with proctitis. The SNP and copy number data were genotyped on Affymetrix® Genome-wide Human SNP Array 6.0. Following QC measures, the genotypes were used to obtain gene expression by leveraging GTEx, a reference dataset for gene expression association based on genotype and RNA-seq information for prostate (n = 132) and whole-blood tissue (n = 369).  Results:   In prostate tissue, 62 genes were significantly associated with proctitis, and 98 genes in whole-blood tissue. Six genes - CABLES2, ATP6AP1L, IFIT5, ATRIP, TELO2, and PARD6G were common to both tissues. The copy number analysis identified seven regions associated with proctitis, one of which (ALG1L2) was also associated with proctitis based on transcriptomic profiles in the whole-blood tissue. The genes identified via transcriptomics and copy number variation association were further investigated for enriched pathways and gene ontology. Some of the enriched processes were DNA repair, mitochondrial apoptosis regulation, cell-to-cell signaling interaction processes for renal and urological system, and organismal injury.  Conclusions:   We report gene expression changes based on genetic polymorphisms. Integrating gene-network information identified these genes to relate to canonical DNA repair genes and processes. This investigation highlights genes involved in DNA repair processes and mitochondrial malfunction possibly via inflammation. Therefore, it is suggested that larger studies will provide more power to infer the extent of underlying genetic contribution for an individual's susceptibility to developing radiotoxicity.""","""['Gita A Pathak', 'Renato Polimanti', 'Talisa K Silzer', 'Frank R Wendt', 'Ranajit Chakraborty', 'Nicole R Phillips']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""BMC Cancer""","""['Integrated Genome-Wide Analysis of Gene Expression and DNA Copy Number Variations Highlights Stem Cell-Related Pathways in Small Cell Esophageal Carcinoma.', 'DNA copy number alterations, gene expression changes and disease-free survival in patients with colorectal cancer: a 10 year follow-up.', 'Inter- and intra-breed genome-wide copy number diversity in a large cohort of European equine breeds.', 'Genetic risk profiles for cancer susceptibility and therapy response.', ""Transcriptomics in Alzheimer's Disease: Aspects and Challenges."", 'Emerging glyco-risk prediction model to forecast response to immune checkpoint inhibitors in colorectal cancer.', 'GPI-anchored glutathione S-transferase as marker allows affinity sorting of transfection-positive cells.', 'rs10514231 Leads to Breast Cancer Predisposition by Altering ATP6AP1L Gene Expression.', 'A Ten-year-long Update on Radiation Proctitis Among Prostate Cancer Patients Treated With Curative External Beam Radiotherapy.']"""

Several risk classification systems, including CAPRA-S, are currently used for disease prognostication. However, high-risk patients identified by these systems can still exhibit wide-ranging disease outcomes, leading to overtreatment of some patients in this group.  Methods:   The master methylation regulator TET2 is downregulated in prostate cancer, where its loss is linked to aggressive disease and poor outcome. Using a random forest strategy, we developed a model based on the expression of 38 genes associated with TET2 utilizing 100 radical prostatectomy samples (training cohort) with a 49% biochemical recurrence rate. This 38-gene model was comprised of both upregulated and downregulated TET2-associated genes with a binary outcome, and was further assessed in an independent validation (n = 423) dataset for association with biochemical recurrence.  Results:   38-gene model status was able to correctly identify patients exhibiting recurrence with 81.4% sensitivity in the validation cohort, and added significant prognostic utility to the high-risk CAPRA-S classification group. Patients considered high-risk by CAPRA-S with negative 38-gene model status exhibited no statistically significant difference in time to recurrence from low-risk CAPRA-S patients, indicating that the expression of TET2-associated genes is able to separate truly high-risk cases from those which have a more benign disease course.  Conclusions:   The 38-gene model may hold potential in determining which patients would truly benefit from aggressive treatment course, demonstrating a novel role for genes linked to TET2 in the prognostication of PCa and indicating the importance of TET2 dysregulation among high-risk patient groups.""","""['Shivani Kamdar', 'Neil E Fleshner', 'Bharati Bapat']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""BMC Cancer""","""['Exploring targets of TET2-mediated methylation reprogramming as potential discriminators of prostate cancer progression.', 'Comparing Prognostic Utility of a Single-marker Immunohistochemistry Approach with Commercial Gene Expression Profiling Following Radical Prostatectomy.', 'Combining CAPRA-S With Tumor IDC/C Features Improves the Prognostication of Biochemical Recurrence in Prostate Cancer Patients.', 'Prognostic value of the CAPRA clinical prediction rule: a systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Optimum Tools for Predicting Clinical Outcomes in Prostate Cancer Patients Undergoing Radical Prostatectomy: A Systematic Review of Prognostic Accuracy and Validity.']"""

Controversy continues over the effectiveness of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) for distinguishing aggressive from indolent PCa. There is a critical need for more specific and sensitive biomarkers to detect and distinguish low- versus high-risk PCa cases. Discovery metabolomics were performed utilizing ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS) on plasma samples from 159 men with treatment naïve prostate cancer participating in the North Carolina-Louisiana PCa Project to determine if there were metabolites associated with aggressive PCa. Thirty-five identifiable plasma small molecules were associated with PCa aggressiveness, 15 of which were sphingolipids; nine common molecules were present in both African-American and European-American men. The molecules most associated with PCa aggressiveness were glycosphingolipids; levels of trihexosylceramide and tetrahexosylceramide were most closely associated with high-aggressive PCa. The Cancer Genome Atlas was queried to determine gene alterations within glycosphingolipid metabolism that are associated with PCa and other cancers. Genes that encode enzymes associated with the metabolism of glycosphingolipids were altered in 12% of PCa and >30% of lung, uterine, and ovarian cancers. These data suggest that the identified plasma (glyco)sphingolipids should be further validated for their association with aggressive PCa, suggesting that specific sphingolipids may be included in a diagnostic signature for PCa.""","""['Ashley J Snider', 'Michael C Seeds', 'Laurel Johnstone', 'Justin M Snider', 'Brian Hallmark', 'Rahul Dutta', 'Cristina Moraga Franco', 'John S Parks', 'Jeannette T Bensen', 'Corey D Broeckling', 'James L Mohler', 'Gary J Smith', 'Elizabeth T H Fontham', 'Hui-Kuan Lin', 'William Bresette', 'Susan Sergeant', 'Floyd H Chilton']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Biomolecules""","""['Plasma metabolomic profile in prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia and prostate cancer and associations with the prostate-specific antigen and the Gleason score.', 'Baseline Prostate-specific Antigen Level in Midlife and Aggressive Prostate Cancer in Black Men.', 'Prostate cancer diagnosis and characterization with mass spectrometry imaging.', 'Carotenoid intake and adipose tissue carotenoid levels in relation to prostate cancer aggressiveness among African-American and European-American men in the North Carolina-Louisiana prostate cancer project (PCaP).', 'The role of biomarkers in the assessment of prostate cancer risk prior to prostate biopsy: which markers matter and how should they be used?', 'Targeting lipid metabolism in metastatic prostate cancer.', 'Accuracy of novel urinary biomarker tests in the diagnosis of prostate cancer: A systematic review and network meta-analysis.', 'Dihydroceramide desaturase 1 (DES1) promotes anchorage-independent survival downstream of HER2-driven glucose uptake and metabolism.', ""Role of Lipids and Lipid Metabolism in Prostate Cancer Progression and the Tumor's Immune Environment."", 'The Biomolecules Journal Club: Highlights on Recent Papers-1.']"""

The malignancy index was obtained by dividing the product of three biomarker values, [urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA), plasminogen activator inhibitor type-1 (PAI-1), and prostate-specific antigen (PSA)], by the age of the patient/healthy volunteer, using enzyme-linked immunosorbent (ELISA) assay methodology.

Radiology reports are designed for clinicians and can be very technical and difficult for patients to understand. It is important for patients to understand their magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) report in order to make an informed treatment decision with their physician. Therefore, we aimed to create a patient-centered prostate MRI report to give our patients a better understanding of their clinical condition.  Methods:   A prototype patient-centered radiology report (PACERR) was created by identifying items to include based on opinions sought from a group of patients undergoing prostate MRI and medical experts. Data was collected in semi-structured interviews using a salient belief question. A prototype PACERR was created in collaboration with human factors engineering and design, medical imaging, biomedical informatics, and cancer patient education groups.  Results:   Fifteen patients and eight experts from urology, radiation oncology, radiology, and nursing participated in this study. Patients were particularly interested to have a report with laymen terms, concise language, contextualization of values, definitions of medical terms, and next course of action. Everyone believed the report should include the risk of MRI findings actually being cancer in the subsequent biopsy.  Conclusions:   A prostate MRI PACERR has been developed to communicate the most important findings relevant to decision-making in prostate cancer using patient-oriented design principles. The ability of this tool to improve patient knowledge and communication will be explored.""","""['Nathan Perlis', 'Antonio Finelli', 'Mike Lovas', 'Alejandro Berlin', 'Janet Papadakos', 'Sangeet Ghai', 'Vasiliki Bakas', 'Shabbir Alibhai', 'Odelia Lee', 'Adam Badzynski', 'David Wiljer', 'Alexis Lund', 'Amelia Di Meo', 'Joseph Cafazzo', 'Masoom Haider']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Can Urol Assoc J""","""['Exploring the value of using patient-oriented MRI reports in clinical practice - a pilot study.', 'Development and validation of a patient decision aid for prostate Cancer therapy: from paternalistic towards participative shared decision making.', ""Patients' Use and Evaluation of an Online System to Annotate Radiology Reports with Lay Language Definitions."", ""ESUR/ESUI consensus statements on multi-parametric MRI for the detection of clinically significant prostate cancer: quality requirements for image acquisition, interpretation and radiologists' training."", 'Standards of reporting for MRI-targeted biopsy studies (START) of the prostate: recommendations from an International Working Group.', 'The delicate balance of patient autonomy and compassionate care.']"""

This study was designed to describe the patient-reported performance status (PS) and the provider-reported PS.  Methods:   Patients with metastatic genitourinary cancers were recruited from a single cancer center before the initiation of a new line of treatment. PS (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group [ECOG]), quality of life (Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-General), and distress (Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System Anxiety and Depression) were self-reported by patients. Clinical data (eg, age, sex, diagnosis, and physician-reported ECOG PS) were extracted from medical records. Multivariate analysis was used to determine the association between PS, quality of life, and psychological symptoms.  Results:   One hundred forty-five patients were enrolled (76.6% male, 70.3% White, 81.4% married, and 76.6% well educated). The median age was 67 years; 66.9% were diagnosed with renal cell carcinoma, 20.0% were diagnosed with urothelial carcinoma, and 13.1% were diagnosed with prostate cancer. Clinicians more frequently classified patients' ECOG PS as 0 in comparison with the patients themselves (92.4% vs 64.1%; P = .001). Higher clinician-reported ECOG PS was associated with poorer physical and functional well-being and higher rates of depression (P < .01), whereas higher patient-reported ECOG PS was associated with worse psychosocial outcomes (P < .01).  Conclusions:   Discrepancies were noted between the patient- and provider-reported ECOG PS, with clinicians overestimating the ECOG PS in comparison with the patients themselves. This study's findings suggest that patients incorporate their social and emotional well-being into their PS score in addition to their physical well-being. This information is not immediately accessible to most clinicians from just a standard patient interview and likely accounts for the overestimation of the patients' ECOG PS by the clinicians.""","""['Cristiane Decat Bergerot', 'Errol J Philip', 'Paulo Gustavo Bergerot', 'JoAnn Hsu', 'Nazli Dizman', 'Megan Salgia', 'Nicholas Salgia', 'Ulka Vaishampayan', 'Dena Battle', 'Matthew Loscalzo', 'William Dale', 'Sumanta Kumar Pal']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Cancer""","""['Who really knows the performance status: The physician or the patient?', 'Comparing Physician and Nurse Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status (ECOG-PS) Ratings as Predictors of Clinical Outcomes in Patients with Cancer.', 'Association of Performance Status With Survival in Patients With Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Treated With Pembrolizumab Monotherapy.', 'Patient-Reported Outcomes From Patients Receiving Immunotherapy or Chemoimmunotherapy for Metastatic Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer in Clinical Practice.', 'Distress and Quality of Life Among Patients with Advanced Genitourinary Cancers.', 'Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer: American Society of Clinical Oncology Clinical Practice Guideline.', 'Willingness of patients with cancer pain to participate in end-of-life decisions: a multi-center cross-sectional study from three coastal provinces in southern China.', 'Construction and Validation of Prediction Model of Severe Abdominal Pain Post-Transarterial Chemoembolization in Patients with HBV-Associated Primary Liver Cancer.', 'Controlling Nutritional Status Score Before Receiving Treatment as a Prognostic Indicator for Patients With Urothelial Cancer: An Exploration Evaluation Methods.', 'Modified Glasgow Prognostic Score associated with survival in metastatic renal cell carcinoma treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors.', 'Pembrolizumab for treating advanced urothelial carcinoma in patients with impaired performance status: Analysis of a Japanese nationwide cohort.']"""

Nevertheless, most studies assume the availability of large training sets, which is rarely the case. For this reason, in the clinical setting, rules are still common. We suggest 2 methods to leverage the knowledge encoded in pre-existing rules to inform ML decisions and obtain high performance, even with scarce annotations.  Methods:   We collected 501 prostate pathology reports from 6 American hospitals. Reports were split into 2,711 core segments, annotated with 20 attributes describing the histology, grade, extension, and location of tumors. The data set was split by institutions to generate a cross-institutional evaluation setting. We assessed 4 systems, namely a rule-based approach, an ML model, and 2 hybrid systems integrating the previous methods: a Rule as Feature model and a Classifier Confidence model. Several ML algorithms were tested, including logistic regression (LR), support vector machine (SVM), and eXtreme gradient boosting (XGB).  Results:   When training on data from a single institution, LR lags behind the rules by 3.5% (F1 score: 92.2% v 95.7%). Hybrid models, instead, obtain competitive results, with Classifier Confidence outperforming the rules by +0.5% (96.2%). When a larger amount of data from multiple institutions is used, LR improves by +1.5% over the rules (97.2%), whereas hybrid systems obtain +2.2% for Rule as Feature (97.7%) and +2.6% for Classifier Confidence (98.3%). Replacing LR with SVM or XGB yielded similar performance gains.  Conclusion:   We developed methods to use pre-existing handcrafted rules to inform ML algorithms. These hybrid systems obtain better performance than either rules or ML models alone, even when training data are limited.""","""['Enrico Santus', 'Tal Schuster', 'Amir M Tahmasebi', 'Clara Li', 'Adam Yala', 'Conor R Lanahan', 'Peter Prinsen', 'Scott F Thompson', 'Samuel Coons', 'Lance Mynderse', 'Regina Barzilay', 'Kevin Hughes']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""JCO Clin Cancer Inform""","""['Data-driven diagnosis of spinal abnormalities using feature selection and machine learning algorithms.', 'Energy Efficiency of Inference Algorithms for Clinical Laboratory Data Sets: Green Artificial Intelligence Study.', 'Predicting in-hospital mortality in ICU patients with sepsis using gradient boosting decision tree.', 'Performance of a Machine Learning Classifier of Knee MRI Reports in Two Large Academic Radiology Practices: A Tool to Estimate Diagnostic Yield.', 'LEMRG: Decision Rule Generation Algorithm for Mining MicroRNA Expression Data.', 'Improving Information Extraction from Pathology Reports using Named Entity Recognition.', 'Artificial intelligence in pancreatic cancer: diagnosis, limitations, and the future prospects-a narrative review.', 'Empowering digital pathology applications through explainable knowledge extraction tools.', 'Artificial Intelligence and Early Detection of Pancreatic Cancer: 2020 Summative Review.', 'Artificial Intelligence-Aided Precision Medicine for COVID-19: Strategic Areas of Research and Development.']"""

Once both OPN4 and OPN5 are differentially expressed and also evidence tumor-specific expression patterns, we hypothesize that similarly to the other OPN-SV, they also possibly contribute to key aspects of tumor progression, what should be further functionally investigated in distinct tumor models.""","""['Gabriela Ribeiro Silva', 'Daniella Santos Mattos', 'Ana Clara Fonseca Bastos', 'Bruna Prunes Pena Baroni Viana', 'Mariana Concentino Menezes Brum', 'Luciana Bueno Ferreira', 'Etel Rodrigues Pereira Gimba']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Mol Biol Rep""","""['Both osteopontin-c and osteopontin-b splicing isoforms exert pro-tumorigenic roles in prostate cancer cells.', 'Changes in the transcriptional profile in response to overexpression of the osteopontin-c splice isoform in ovarian (OvCar-3) and prostate (PC-3) cancer cell lines.', 'Osteopontin splice variants expression is involved on docetaxel resistance in PC3 prostate cancer cells.', 'Human osteopontin splicing isoforms: known roles, potential clinical applications and activated signaling pathways.', 'Osteopontin b and c Splice isoforms in Leukemias and Solid Tumors: Angiogenesis Alongside Chemoresistance.', 'Total Osteopontin and Its Isoform OPN4 Are Differently Expressed in Respiratory Samples during Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 Infection and Progression.', 'Meta-analysis of Osteopontin splice variants in cancer.', 'The Intracellular and Secreted Sides of Osteopontin and Their Putative Physiopathological Roles.', 'Gene Expression Patterns of Osteopontin Isoforms and Integrins in Malignant Melanoma.', 'Expression of osteopontin-5 splice variant in the mouse primary and metastatic breast cancer cells.']"""

Objective:   To compare the risk of secondary sarcoma among patients treated with combinations of surgery, radiation, or chemotherapy with patients treated with surgery alone and the general population.  Design, setting, and participants:   This population-based cohort study included 173 580 patients in Ontario, Canada, with nonmetastatic cancer of the prostate, bladder, colon, rectum or anus, cervix, uterus, or testis. Patients were enrolled from January 1, 2002, to January 31, 2017. Data analysis was conducted from March 1, 2019, to January 31, 2020.  Exposures:   Treatment combinations of radiation, chemotherapy, and surgery.  Main outcome and measures:   Diagnosis of sarcoma based on histologic codes from the Ontario Cancer Registry. Time to sarcoma was compared using a cause-specific proportional hazard model.  Results:   Of 173 580 patients, most were men (125 080 [72.1%]), and the largest group was aged between 60 and 69 years (58 346 [33.6%]). Most patients had genitourinary cancer (86 235 [51.4%]) or colorectal cancer (69 241 [39.9%]). Overall, 64 301 (37.1%) received surgery alone, 51 220 (29.5%) received radiation alone, 15 624 (9.0%) were treated with radiation and chemotherapy, 15 252 (8.8%) received radiation with surgery, and 11 822 (6.8%) received all 3 treatments. A total of 332 patients (0.2%) had sarcomas develop during a median (interquartile range) follow-up of 5.7 (2.2-8.9) years. The incidence of sarcoma was 0.3% among those who underwent radiation alone (138 of 51 220) and radiation with chemotherapy (40 of 15 624), 0.2% among those who received radiation and surgery (36 of 15 252) and all 3 modalities (25 of 11 822), and 0.1% among those who received surgery with chemotherapy (13 of 14 861) and surgery alone (80 of 64 801). Compared with a reference group of patients who had surgery alone, the greatest risk of sarcoma was found among patients who underwent a combination of radiation and chemotherapy (cause-specific relative hazard [csRH], 4.07; 95% CI, 2.75-6.01; P < .001), followed by patients who had radiation alone (csRH, 2.35; 95% CI, 1.77-3.12; P < .001), radiation with surgery (csRH, 2.33; 95% CI, 1.57-3.46; P < .001), and all 3 modalities (csRH, 2.27; 95% CI, 1.44-3.58; P < .001). In the general population, 7987 events occurred during 46 554 803 person-years (17.2 events per 100 000 person-years). The standardized incidence ratio for sarcoma among patients treated with radiation compared with the general population was 2.41 (95% CI, 1.57-3.69; 41.3 events per 100 000 person-years). The annual number of cases of sarcoma increased from 2009 (15 per 100 000 persons) to 2016 (32 per 100 000 persons), but the annual rate did not change during the study period.  Conclusions and relevance:   In this cohort study, patients treated with radiation or chemotherapy for abdominopelvic cancers had an increased rate of sarcoma. Although the absolute rate is low, patients and physicians should be aware of this increased risk of developing sarcoma.""","""['Amanda E Hird', 'Diana E Magee', 'Rano Matta', 'Refik Saskin', 'Erind Dvorani', 'Girish S Kulkarni', 'Ronald Kodama', 'Sender Herschorn', 'Steven A Narod', 'Robert K Nam']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""JAMA Netw Open""","""['Secondary sarcomas in childhood cancer survivors: a report from the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study.', 'Italian cancer figures, report 2013: Multiple tumours.', 'Risk of second bone sarcoma following childhood cancer: role of radiation therapy treatment.', 'Radiation-induced sarcoma after breast cancer.

In a previous study, [18F]-JK-PSMA-7 exhibited favorable properties for tumor localization after biochemical recurrence. In this retrospective study, we evaluated the performance of [18F]-JK-PSMA-7 under ADT.  Procedures:   We examined the performance of [18F]-JK-PSMA-7 in 70 patients (first cohort) with increasing or detectable PSA values under ADT (PSA < 2 ng/ml for 21/70 patients). We further analyzed 58 independent patients with PSA levels < 2 ng/ml under ADT, who were imaged with [68Ga]PSMA-11 or [18F]DCFPyL (second cohort). Finally, we compared detection rates between [18F]-JK-PSMA-7, [68Ga]PSMA-11, and [18F]DCFPyL.  Results:   In the first cohort, we detected [18F]-JK-PSMA-7-positive lesions in 63/70 patients. In patients with PSA levels ≥ 2 ng/ml, the detection rate was 100 % (49/49). In patients with PSA < 2 ng/ml, the detection rate was significantly lower (66.7 %, 14/21, p = 9.7 × 10-5) and dropped from 85.7 % (12/14, PSA levels between 0.3 and 2.0 ng/ml) to 28.6 % (2/7) for PSA levels < 0.3 ng/ml (p = 1.73 × 10-2). In the second cohort (PSA < 2 ng/ml), the detection rate was 79.3 % (46/58) for [68Ga]PSMA-11 or [18F]DCFPyL. Again, the detection rate was significantly higher (p = 1.1 × 10-2) for patients with PSA levels between 0.3 and 2.0 ng/ml (87.0 %, 40/46) relative to those with PSA levels < 0.3 ng/ml (50 %, 6/12). No significant difference was found between [18F]-JK-PSMA-7 and [68Ga]PSMA-11 or [18F]DCFPyL in patients with PSA levels < 2 ng/ml (p = 0.4295).  Conclusion:   [18F]-JK-PSMA-7 PET showed a high detection rate in patients with PSA levels ≥ 0.3 ng/ml under ADT. The lower PSA threshold of 0.3 ng/ml for high detection rates was consistent across the three PSMA ligands.

Though hypofractionation is commonly used for radical treatments, open issues still remain in the postoperative setting due to the lack of long-term data. Aim of this study was to evaluate long-term results of postoperative moderately hypofractionated RT (MHRT).  Methods:   We conducted a retrospective analysis including PC patients treated with prostatectomy and postoperative MHRT delivered with volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT). Endpoints of the analysis included biochemical relapse-free survival (BRFS), distant metastases free-survival (DMFS), overall survival (OS), and pattern of acute and late toxicity.  Results:   181 patients were included. Pathological stage was classified as pT3a in 33.6% and pT3b in 30%. Median PSA value before RT was 0.23 ng/ml and median RT total dose was 70 Gy (65-74.2 Gy) in 25/28 fractions. With a median follow-up of 54.5 months, rates of BRFS at 3 and 5 years were 80.7 and 72.3%. ISUP grade group (HR 1.44, p = 0.015), pathological T stage (HR 2.03; p = 0.009), and pre-RT PSA >0.2 ng/ml (HR 2.64; p = 0.015) were correlated with BRFS. Three and 5‑year DMFS were 87.4 and 80.8%. ISUP grade group (HR 1.50; p = 0.011) and pre-RT PSA (HR 5.34; p = 0.001) were correlated with DMFS. Five (2.7%) and 3 (1.6%) patients reported late grade 3 GU and GI toxicity, respectively.  Conclusion:   Our results confirm the long-term safety and efficacy of postoperative MHRT for PC.

HSP70, a highly conserved HSP, has been reported to correlate with the proliferation and migration of human cancer cells, such as oral, prostate, lung and liver cancer. Regarding hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the HSP70 levels in the tumor tissues from patients are significantly higher than those in the normal liver tissues. HSP70 reportedly upregulates the migration and invasion of HCC. The AKT, p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), c-jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and Rho-kinase signaling pathways regulate the transforming growth factor (TGF)-α-induced migration of human HCC-derived HuH7 cells. However, the exact mechanism underlying the role of HSP70 in growth factor-induced HCC migration remains unclear. Therefore, in the present study, the mechanism underlying the involvement of HSP70 in TGF-α-induced HCC cell migration was investigated. Treatment with the HSP70 inhibitors VER155008 and YM-08 and the downregulation of HSP70 protein were confirmed to significantly suppress the TGF-α-induced cell migration of HuH7 cells. Both VER155008 and YM-08 reduced the TGF-α-induced phosphorylation of AKT without affecting the phosphorylation of p38 MAPK, JNK or Rho-kinase. These results strongly suggest that HSP70 positively regulates the TGF-α-induced migration of HCC cells via the AKT signaling pathway.""","""['Kaido Kobayashi', 'Rie Matsushima-Nishiwaki', 'Noriko Yamada', 'Saori Migita', 'Tomoyuki Hioki', 'Daisuke Mizutani', 'Osamu Kozawa']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Heliyon""","""['Phosphorylated Heat Shock Protein 20 (HSPB6) Regulates Transforming Growth Factor-α-Induced Migration and Invasion of Hepatocellular Carcinoma Cells.', 'Olive oil polyphenols suppress the TGF-α-induced migration of hepatocellular carcinoma cells.', 'SERMs (selective estrogen receptor modulator), acting as estrogen receptor β agonists in hepatocellular carcinoma cells, inhibit the transforming growth factor-α-induced migration via specific inhibition of AKT signaling pathway.', 'Involvement of 14-3-3 Proteins in Regulating Tumor Progression of Hepatocellular Carcinoma.', 'Pleiotropic effects of methionine adenosyltransferases deregulation as determinants of liver cancer progression and prognosis.', 'Dihydromyricetin inhibits proliferation and migration of gastric cancer cells through regulating Akt/STAT3 signaling pathways and HMGB1 expression.']"""

Proinflammatory M1 macrophages promote T helper (Th) 1 responses and show tumoricidal activity, whereas M2 macrophages display regulatory functions in tissue repair and remodeling and promote Th2 immune responses. Previous studies have shown that miRNA let-7 is associated with cellular differentiation and that the expression of let-7b-5p is significantly augmented in M2 macrophages. However, the mechanism by which let-7b-5p regulates macrophage differentiation in prostate cancer (PCa) remains largely unknown.  Methods:   Human macrophages were induced by blood monocytes from healthy male donors, and M1 macrophages were polarized by stimulating them overnight with 100 ng/ml of lipopolysaccharides and 100 ng/ml of IFN-γ. Conditioned medium from PC-3 cells was used to induce prostatic macrophages (M-CMs) in vitro, and we then transfected let-7b-5p mimics or inhibitors into M1 and M-CMs for 72 h. The expression of cluster of differentiation 206 (CD206) in each group was detected with the High-Throughput Connotation of Imaging System. We used quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) to examine the expression of the inflammatory cytokines IL-10, IL-12, IL-13, TNF-alpha, and let-7b in macrophages. SOCS1 protein levels were evaluated by ELISA, and the phosphorylation difference in STAT family member proteins was analyzed using CST signal-pathway chip. Phagocytosis by macrophages and the effect of macrophages on the proliferation of prostate cancer PC-3 cells were evaluated with phagocytosis assay or the Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) and colony formation assay. The relationship between SOCS1 and let-7b-5p was confirmed with a dual-luciferase reporter.  Results:   The expression of cluster of differentiation 206 (CD206, a M2-like macrophage surface molecule) was significantly increased in M1 macrophages treated with let-7b-5p mimics, while CD206 expression was decreased in M-CMs treated with let-7b-5p inhibitors. Overexpression or knockdown of let-7b-5p significantly affected the expression of inflammatory factors in macrophages-including interleukin 10 (IL-10), IL-12, IL-13, and tumor necrosis factor alpha. Let-7b-5p downregulated the expression of suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 (SOCS1) and increased the phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1), STAT3, and STAT5a proteins in M-CMs and M1 macrophages with let-7b-5p mimics relative to the other groups. In addition, with the elevated expression of let-7b-5p, the phagocytosis by macrophages showed a commensurate and significant decrease. As a result, M-CMs treated with let-7b-5p inhibitors reduced the proliferation of PC-3 PCa cells.  Conclusions:   Collectively, these data indicated that let-7b-5p may regulate M2 polarization through the SOCS1/STAT pathway and that reversal of M2 differentiation by let-7b-5p inhibitors enhanced macrophage phagocytosis, ultimately inhibiting the proliferation of PCa cells.""","""['Jiping Rong#', 'Lu Xu#', 'Yinying Hu', 'Fan Liu', 'Yanrong Yu', 'Hongyan Guo', 'Xudong Ni', 'Yanqin Huang', 'Lin Zhao', 'Zhigang Wang']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Cancer Cell Int""","""['Systemic Inflammation Induced by microRNAs: Endometriosis-Derived Alterations in Circulating microRNA 125b-5p and Let-7b-5p Regulate Macrophage Cytokine Production.', 'High-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) protects against ischemic stroke by inhibiting M1 microglia polarization through let-7b-5p/HMGA2/NF-κB signaling pathway.', 'Exosomes derived from M1 macrophages inhibit the proliferation of the A549 and H1299 lung cancer cell lines via the miRNA-let-7b-5p-GNG5 axis.', 'MiRNA-Mediated Macrophage Polarization and its Potential Role in the Regulation of Inflammatory Response.', 'Regulation of the MIR155 host gene in physiological and pathological processes.', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress Promotes Prostate Cancer Cells to Release Exosome and Up-regulate PD-L1 Expression via PI3K/Akt Signaling Pathway in Macrophages.', 'Identification and characterization of miRNAs in spleens of sheep subjected to repetitive vaccination.', 'Let-7b-5p inhibits breast cancer cell growth and metastasis via repression of hexokinase 2-mediated aerobic glycolysis.', 'CD146+ Endometrial-Derived Mesenchymal Stem/Stromal Cell Subpopulation Possesses Exosomal Secretomes with Strong Immunomodulatory miRNA Attributes.', 'Tamoxifen resistance-related ceRNA network for breast cancer.']"""

Current available imaging techniques remain unreliable in assessing response to therapies, as they cannot distinguish between (vital) tumor tissue and therapy induced fibrosis (TIF). Consequently, resections with tumor positive margins and subsequent early post-operative recurrences occur and patients eligible for potential radical resection could be missed. To optimize patient selection and monitor results of neoadjuvant treatment, PDAC-specific diagnostic and intraoperative molecular imaging methods are required. This study aims to evaluate molecular imaging targets for PDAC after neoadjuvant FOLFIRINOX treatment. Expression of integrin αvβ6, carcinoembryonic antigen cell adhesion molecule 5 (CEACAM5), mesothelin, prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA), urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor, fibroblast activating receptor, integrin α5 subunit and epidermal growth factor receptor was evaluated using immunohistochemistry. Immunoreactivity was determined using the semiquantitative H-score. Resection specimens from patients after neoadjuvant FOLFIRINOX treatment containing PDAC (n = 32), tumor associated pancreatitis (TAP) and TIF (n = 15), normal pancreas parenchyma (NPP) (n = 32) and tumor positive (n = 24) and negative (n = 56) lymph nodes were included.

Many randomized controlled trials (RCTs) showed promising results that men with metastatic castration-resistant PCa (mCRPC) might benefit from treatment with CYP17 inhibitors such as abiraterone acetate and orteronel. The goal of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of CYP17 inhibitors for the prognosis in patients with mCRPC.  Materials and methods:   Studies were identified in PubMed/MEDLINE, the Cochrane Library, and the Web of Science. The RCTs with mCRPC patients focusing on the efficacy of CYP17 inhibitors were involved. Then, we analyzed the patients' prognosis such as overall survival (OS) and radiographic progression-free survival (RPFS).  Results:   A meta-analysis of the pooled data from seven randomized Phase III clinical trials was performed to compare 5516 mCRPC patients with CYP17 inhibitors versus that with placebo. Compared to placebo, the CYP17 inhibitors significantly increased the OS (pooled hazard ratios [HR]: 0.816, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.750-0.887), RPFS (pooled HR: 0.647, 95% CI: 0.557-0.752), and time to prostate-specific antigen (PSA) progression (pooled HR: 0.599, 95% CI: 0.517-0.693). Additional endpoints such as PSA response rate, objective response assessed by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, and time to initiation of chemotherapy were included in this study and were found having significant improvement with CYP17 inhibitors compared to placebo.  Conclusion:   This research showed that CYP17 inhibitors had a significant improvement on prognosis of patients with mCRPC within a relative safety profile both in pre- and post-chemotherapy trials. These expected results provide evidence for the use of CYP17 inhibitors to treat mCRPCs.""","""['Qi Cao', 'Peng Bai', 'Deyao Shi', 'Jiali Liao', 'Hangchuan Shi', 'Yifei Xing', 'Ke Chen', 'Xiaoping Zhang']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""J Cancer Res Ther""","""['Updated interim efficacy analysis and long-term safety of abiraterone acetate in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer patients without prior chemotherapy (COU-AA-302).', 'Efficacy and safety of abiraterone acetate in an elderly patient subgroup (aged 75 and older) with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer after docetaxel-based chemotherapy.', 'Abiraterone for treatment of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Outcomes with abiraterone acetate in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer patients who have poor performance status.', 'Efficacy and safety of second-line agents for treatment of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer progressing after docetaxel.

A newly developed urine assay, Xpert Bladder Cancer Detection (Xpert), measures five mRNA targets (ABL1, CRH, IGF2, UPK1B, and ANXA10) that are frequently overexpressed in BC.  Objective:   To validate the performance of Xpert in patients with haematuria.  Design, setting, and participants:   Voided precystoscopy urine specimens were prospectively collected at 22 sites from patients without prior BC undergoing cystoscopy for haematuria. Xpert, cytology, and UroVysion procedures were performed. Technical validation was performed and specificity (SP) was determined in patients without BC.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Test characteristics were calculated based on cystoscopy and histology results, and compared between Xpert, cytology, and UroVysion.  Results and limitations:   We included 828 patients (mean age 64.5 yr, 467 males, 401 never smoked). Xpert had an SN of 78% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 66-87) overall and 90% (95% CI: 76-96) for high-grade (HG) tumours. The NPV was 98% (95% CI: 97-99) overall. The SP was 84% (95% CI: 81-86). In patients with microhaematuria, only one HG patient was missed (NPV 99%). Xpert had higher SN and NPV than cytology and UroVysion. Cytology had the highest SP (97%). In a separate SP study, Xpert had an SP of 89% in patients with benign prostate hypertrophy and 92% in prostate cancer patients.  Conclusions:   Xpert is an easy-to-use, noninvasive test with improved SN and NPV compared with cytology and UroVysion, representing a promising tool for identifying haematuric patients with a low likelihood of BC who might not need to undergo cystoscopy.  Patient summary:   Xpert is an easy-to-perform urine test with good performance compared with standard urine tests.

This progression is mainly related to the androgen receptor (AR)-related mechanisms of resistance, and, several AR-targeted therapies have demonstrated benefit in metastatic and nonmetastatic disease. Apalutamide is a third-generation AR-targeted therapy which competitively blocks the AR and prevents AR dimerization, nuclear internalization, thereby avoiding cancer progression. Early studies have demonstrated that apalutamide was safe and demonstrated clinical benefit. Phase II and phase III studies had confirmed preliminary results of clinical benefit with apalutamide in patients with nonmetastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (nmCRPC) and in metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (mHSPC).  Areas covered:   Herein, the authors discuss the development of apalutamide, from its discovery and early studies to phase III trials. They also examine new perspectives and biomarkers that may help oncologists to make decisions in patients taking apalutamide. Studies evaluating apalutamide in other settings and in combination with other therapies are also debated.  Expert opinion:   Apalutamide has become a relevant therapy for patients with nmCRPC and mHSPC for its benefit in delaying metastasis in addition to its improvement of overall survival, without compromising the quality of life. Apalutamide should be considered as a standard-of-care for patients with nmCRPC and patients with mHSPC.""","""['Pedro Isaacsson Velho', ""Pedro Tofani Sant' Anna"", 'Rommel Fabricio Pereira da Silva', 'Rafael Dal Ponte Ferreira', 'Fernando Castilho Venero']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Expert Opin Drug Discov""","""['Apalutamide for the treatment of prostate cancer.', 'Phase 2 Study of the Safety and Antitumor Activity of Apalutamide (ARN-509), a Potent Androgen Receptor Antagonist, in the High-risk Nonmetastatic Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer Cohort.', 'Apalutamide: the established and emerging roles in the treatment of advanced prostate cancer.', 'Health-related quality of life after apalutamide treatment in patients with metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer (TITAN): a randomised, placebo-controlled, phase 3 study.', 'Apalutamide and overall survival in non-metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Novel hormonal therapies in the management of advanced prostate cancer: extrapolating Asian findings to Southeast Asia.', 'Synthesis and Structure-Activity Relationships of Novel Non-Steroidal CYP17A1 Inhibitors as Potential Prostate Cancer Agents.']"""

This study establishes a cell line from prostate tumour tissue derived from the Pten-/-/trp53-/- mouse, termed DVL3 which when subcutaneously implanted in immunocompetent C57BL/6 mice, forms tumours with distinct glandular morphology, strong cytokeratin 8 and androgen receptor expression, recapitulating high-risk localised human PCa. Compared to the commonly used TRAMP C1 model, generated with SV40 large T-antigen, DVL3 tumours are immunologically cold, with a lower proportion of CD8+ T-cells, and high proportion of immunosuppressive myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), thus resembling high-risk PCa. Furthermore, DVL3 tumours are responsive to fractionated RT, a standard treatment for localised and metastatic PCa, compared to the TRAMP C1 model. RNA-sequencing of irradiated DVL3 tumours identified upregulation of type-1 interferon and STING pathways, as well as transcripts associated with MDSCs. Upregulation of STING expression in tumour epithelium and the recruitment of MDSCs following irradiation was confirmed by immunohistochemistry. The DVL3 syngeneic model represents substantial progress in preclinical PCa modelling, displaying pathological, micro-environmental and treatment responses observed in molecular high-risk disease.

Patients and methods:   We included 391 consecutive PSM patients after radical prostatectomy between 1993 and 2007 excluding cases with multiple location PSM or lack of anterior/posterior status data. The oncologic impact of anterior-PSM and posterior-PSM were examined by Kaplan-Meier analysis and the Cox proportional hazards model.  Results:   There were 115 cases (29.4%) with apex-PSM, 257 cases (65.7%) with peripheral PSM, and 19 cases (4.9%) with bladder neck PSM. Among the 257 peripheral PSM cases, 58 cases (22.6%) were with anterior-PSM, 174 cases (67.7%) were with posterior-PSM, and 25 cases (9.7%) were with both anterior and posterior PSM. Over a median follow-up of 12.6 years, patients with anterior-PSM, especially those with low to intermediate Gleason score (≤7), showed a biochemical recurrence (BCR) prognosis similar to those with apex-PSM. In contrast, patients with posterior-PSM showed significantly higher BCR risk on both univariate and multivariate analyses when compared with those with apex-PSM. No impact on metastasis-free survival or overall survival was observed.  Conclusions:   In our study, we found that prostate cancer patients with anterior-PSM showed a more favorable BCR prognosis similar to those with apex-PSM when comparing to patients with posterior-PSM.

We aimed to compare adjuvant versus early salvage radiotherapy after radical prostatectomy, combined with short-term hormonal therapy, in terms of oncological outcomes and tolerance.  Methods:   GETUG-AFU 17 was a randomised, open-label, multicentre, phase 3 trial done at 46 French hospitals. Men aged at least 18 years who had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 1 or less, localised adenocarcinoma of the prostate treated with radical prostatectomy, who had pathologically-staged pT3a, pT3b, or pT4a (with bladder neck invasion), pNx (without pelvic lymph nodes dissection), or pN0 (with negative lymph nodes dissection) disease, and who had positive surgical margins were eligible for inclusion in the study. Eligible patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to either immediate adjuvant radiotherapy or delayed salvage radiotherapy at the time of biochemical relapse. Random assignment, by minimisation, was done using web-based software and stratified by Gleason score, pT stage, and centre. All patients received 6 months of triptorelin (intramuscular injection every 3 months). The primary endpoint was event-free survival. Efficacy and safety analyses were done on the intention-to-treat population. The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT00667069.  Findings:   Between March 7, 2008, and June 23, 2016, 424 patients were enrolled. We planned to enrol 718 patients, with 359 in each study group. However, on May 20, 2016, the independent data monitoring committee recommended early termination of enrolment because of unexpectedly low event rates. At database lock on Dec 19, 2019, the overall median follow-up time from random assignment was 75 months (IQR 50-100), 74 months (47-100) in the adjuvant radiotherapy group and 78 months (52-101) in the salvage radiotherapy group. In the salvage radiotherapy group, 115 (54%) of 212 patients initiated study treatment after biochemical relapse. 205 (97%) of 212 patients started treatment in the adjuvant group. 5-year event-free survival was 92% (95% CI 86-95) in the adjuvant radiotherapy group and 90% (85-94) in the salvage radiotherapy group (HR 0·81, 95% CI 0·48-1·36; log-rank p=0·42). Acute grade 3 or worse toxic effects occurred in six (3%) of 212 patients in the adjuvant radiotherapy group and in four (2%) of 212 patients in the salvage radiotherapy group. Late grade 2 or worse genitourinary toxicities were reported in 125 (59%) of 212 patients in the adjuvant radiotherapy group and 46 (22%) of 212 patients in the salvage radiotherapy group. Late genitourinary adverse events of grade 2 or worse were reported in 58 (27%) of 212 patients in the adjuvant radiotherapy group versus 14 (7%) of 212 patients in the salvage radiotherapy group (p<0·0001). Late erectile dysfunction was grade 2 or worse in 60 (28%) of 212 in the adjuvant radiotherapy group and 17 (8%) of 212 in the salvage radiotherapy group (p<0·0001).  Interpretation:   Although our analysis lacked statistical power, we found no benefit for event-free survival in patients assigned to adjuvant radiotherapy compared with patients assigned to salvage radiotherapy. Adjuvant radiotherapy increased the risk of genitourinary toxicity and erectile dysfunction.

We aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of adjuvant radiotherapy versus an observation policy with salvage radiotherapy for prostate-specific antigen (PSA) biochemical progression.  Methods:   We did a randomised controlled trial enrolling patients with at least one risk factor (pathological T-stage 3 or 4, Gleason score of 7-10, positive margins, or preoperative PSA ≥10 ng/mL) for biochemical progression after radical prostatectomy (RADICALS-RT). The study took place in trial-accredited centres in Canada, Denmark, Ireland, and the UK. Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to adjuvant radiotherapy or an observation policy with salvage radiotherapy for PSA biochemical progression (PSA ≥0·1 ng/mL or three consecutive rises). Masking was not deemed feasible. Stratification factors were Gleason score, margin status, planned radiotherapy schedule (52·5 Gy in 20 fractions or 66 Gy in 33 fractions), and centre. The primary outcome measure was freedom from distant metastases, designed with 80% power to detect an improvement from 90% with salvage radiotherapy (control) to 95% at 10 years with adjuvant radiotherapy. We report on biochemical progression-free survival, freedom from non-protocol hormone therapy, safety, and patient-reported outcomes. Standard survival analysis methods were used. A hazard ratio (HR) of less than 1 favoured adjuvant radiotherapy. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT00541047.  Findings:   Between Nov 22, 2007, and Dec 30, 2016, 1396 patients were randomly assigned, 699 (50%) to salvage radiotherapy and 697 (50%) to adjuvant radiotherapy. Allocated groups were balanced with a median age of 65 years (IQR 60-68). Median follow-up was 4·9 years (IQR 3·0-6·1). 649 (93%) of 697 participants in the adjuvant radiotherapy group reported radiotherapy within 6 months; 228 (33%) of 699 in the salvage radiotherapy group reported radiotherapy within 8 years after randomisation. With 169 events, 5-year biochemical progression-free survival was 85% for those in the adjuvant radiotherapy group and 88% for those in the salvage radiotherapy group (HR 1·10, 95% CI 0·81-1·49; p=0·56). Freedom from non-protocol hormone therapy at 5 years was 93% for those in the adjuvant radiotherapy group versus 92% for those in the salvage radiotherapy group (HR 0·88, 95% CI 0·58-1·33; p=0·53). Self-reported urinary incontinence was worse at 1 year for those in the adjuvant radiotherapy group (mean score 4·8 vs 4·0; p=0·0023). Grade 3-4 urethral stricture within 2 years was reported in 6% of individuals in the adjuvant radiotherapy group versus 4% in the salvage radiotherapy group (p=0·020).  Interpretation:   These initial results do not support routine administration of adjuvant radiotherapy after radical prostatectomy. Adjuvant radiotherapy increases the risk of urinary morbidity. An observation policy with salvage radiotherapy for PSA biochemical progression should be the current standard after radical prostatectomy.

Some have linked oxidative stress with the pathogenesis of cancer. This study assessed the levels of malondialdehyde (MDA), nitric oxide (NO), total plasma peroxide (TPP), and total antioxidant capacity (TAC) in Nigerian patients with CaP.  Patients and methods:   One hundred twenty patients with CaP and 100 apparently healthy controls were consecutively recruited into this case-control study. The patients with CaP were divided into treatment-naïve and androgen deprivation therapy (ADT)-treated groups. Anthropometric indices were measured, and MDA, NO, TAC, and TPP were assayed by colorimetric methods. The t test and analysis of variance were used in analysis of data; statistical significance was set at P < .05, and 95% CIs were reported.  Results:   The patients with CaP had significantly higher waist-hip ratios and NO (P = .0001), TPP (P = .001), oxidative stress index (OSI; P = .003), and MDA values (P = .002) than controls. The treatment-naive patients with CaP had significantly higher waist-hip ratios (P = .011) and TPP (P = .013), MDA (P = .011), and NO values (P = .0001) and lower TAC values (P = .013) compared with the controls. The ADT-treated patients had higher waist-hip ratios (P = .0001) and TPP (P = .005), OSI (P = .005), MDA (P = .011), and NO values (P = .0001) than the controls. However, the treatment-naive patients had significantly higher NO values (P = .05) only compared with the ADT-treated patients. There was a significantly positive correlation between MDA and duration of treatment (r = 0.280, P = .018) in ADT-treated patients with CaP.  Conclusion:   This study demonstrated that patients with CaP have higher levels of TPP, MDA, and NO and lower levels of TAC compared with men without CaP.

Currently, the relationship between BA experience and surgical outcomes in robotic surgery is not clear. We examined whether bedside assistant experience can significantly affect positive margin rate and peri-operative outcomes for RALP for surgeons within their learning curve. A retrospective cohort study of a single surgeon's peri-operative outcomes during RALP was examined and compared with and without an experienced bedside assistant. Patient demographic data and peri-operative data, margin rate, and length of stay (LOS), were collected and analyzed. Univariate and multivariable analyses were performed to determine if expert BA was a predictor of post-operative outcomes. In total, 170 consecutive cases over three years were analyzed. 111 (65%) were performed without an expert BA. The two groups were not significantly different with regards patient demographics (p > 0.05). On univariate analysis, having an expert BA was associated with a significantly lower LOS (31 h ± 21 vs. 42 h ± 26, p = 0.004), EBL (296 ml ± 180 vs. 441 ml ± 305, p < 0.0001) and positive margin rate (20% vs. 37%, p = 0.03). Other surgical outcomes were comparable between groups. On multivariable analysis, expert BA remained a predictor of, EBL (B stat = - 146, 95% CI - 240 to - 52, p = 0.003) and positive margin rate (OR 0.4, 95% CI 0.2-0.96, p = 0.04).

Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) is overexpressed during angioneogenesis in many tumors. We aimed to evaluate the PSMA expression in pancreatic lesions to differentiate these lesions and explore the performance of Ga-68 PSMA-PET/CT vis-a-vis F-18 FDG-PET/CT.  Methods:   Patients with pancreatic lesions on conventional imaging were prospectively recruited. All the patients underwent a whole-body F-18 FDG-PET/CT and a regional abdominal Ga-68 PSMA-PET/CT. Focal tracer uptake (FDG or PSMA) on PET images was considered positive. Histopathology and/or cytopathology were considered the reference standard.  Results:   A total of forty patients (27 males, mean age 55.3 ± 9.8, range 37-71 years) were enrolled. Of these, 19 were diagnosed as malignant on histopathology/cytology. Patients with benign lesions showed no worsening of symptoms for at least 6 months on follow-up. FDG-PET/CT revealed 17 true-positive (TP), 9 false-positive (FP), 12 true-negative (TN), and 2 false-negative (FN) findings, whereas PSMA-PET/CT had 18 TP, 2 FP, 19 TN, and 1 FN finding. The sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, and accuracy for FDG-PET/CT were 89.5%, 57.1%, 65.4%, 85.7%, and 72.5%, respectively, while for PSMA-PET/CT were 94.7%, 90.5%, 90%, 95%, and 92.5%, respectively. ROC curve analysis showed that the SUVmax value of 4.8 on PSMA-PET/CT could predict the malignant potential of a lesion with a specificity of 90.5% and a sensitivity of 84.2%.  Conclusions:   Ga-68 PSMA-PET/CT imaging helped in establishing a non-invasive pre-operative diagnosis of primary pancreatic malignancy with a higher degree of specificity and accuracy compared with FDG-PET/CT.  Key points:   • Conventional imaging such as CT and MRI are unable to reliably differentiate localized malignant pancreatic lesion from benign lesions mimicking malignancy such as mass-forming pancreatitis. • FDG PET/CT helps in detecting malignant foci in view of their increased glucose metabolism. However, it may be falsely positive in inflammatory lesions which may occasionally hinder its ability to differentiate between benign and malignant lesions. • Apart from prostatic malignancy, PSMA is overexpressed in neovasculature of many non-prostatic malignancies. The present study highlights that Ga68 PSMA PET/CT performed better in diagnosing malignancy non-invasively than FDG-PET/CT with a higher PPV (90.5% vs. 65.4%) and accuracy (92.5% vs. 72.5%).""","""['Venkata Subramanian Krishnaraju', 'Rajender Kumar', 'Bhagwant Rai Mittal', 'Vishal Sharma', 'Harjeet Singh', 'Ritambhra Nada', 'Amanjit Bal', 'Manish Rohilla', 'Harmandeep Singh', 'Surinder S Rana']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Eur Radiol""","""['More advantages in detecting bone and soft tissue metastases from prostate cancer using 18F-PSMA PET/CT.', 'Role of (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography in the characterization of pancreatic masses: experience from tropics.', 'Accuracy of FDG-PET/CT for Detection of Incidental Pre-Malignant and Malignant Colonic Lesions - Correlation with Colonoscopic and Histopathologic Findings.', 'Dual-time point 18F-FDG-PET and PET/CT for Differentiating Benign From Malignant Musculoskeletal Lesions: Opportunities and Limitations.', 'Hyperaccumulation of (18)F-FDG in order to differentiate solid pseudopapillary tumors from adenocarcinomas and from neuroendocrine pancreatic tumors and review of the literature.', 'Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen Targeted Pet/CT Imaging in Patients with Colon, Gastric and Pancreatic Cancer.', 'PSMA Expression in Solid Tumors beyond the Prostate Gland: Ready for Theranostic Applications?', 'Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen (PSMA) Expression in Tumor-Associated Neovasculature Is an Independent Prognostic Marker in Patients with Ovarian Cancer.', 'Molecular Targeted Positron Emission Tomography Imaging and Radionuclide Therapy of Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma.', 'Overview and Future Perspectives on Tumor-Targeted Positron Emission Tomography and Fluorescence Imaging of Pancreatic Cancer in the Era of Neoadjuvant Therapy.']"""

There remains no effective treatment for metastatic prostate cancer. We investigate here the anticancer effects of botanical component p-hydroxycinnamic acid (HCA) on the PC-3 cells in vitro model of bone metastatic human prostate cancer. Culturing with HCA (10-1000 nM) suppressed colony formation and growth of PC-3 cells. Mechanistically, culturing with HCA decreased protein levels of Ras, PI3K, Akt, MAPK, NF-κB p65 and β-catenin related to processes of cell signaling and transcription, and it increased levels of p21, p53, retinoblastoma and regucalcin, which are suppressors in carcinogenesis. These alterations can lead to suppression of cell growth. Furthermore, culturing with HCA increased cell death and caspase-3 levels. The effects of HCA on the growth and death of PC-3 cells were blocked by culturing with CH223191, an antagonist of aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR), suggesting that HCA effects are partly involved in AHR signaling. Interestingly, HCA suppressed the stimulatory effects of Bay K 8644, an agonist of L-type calcium channel, on the growth of PC-3 cells. Coculturing of PC-3 cells and preosteoblastic MC-3T3 E1 cells increased osteoblastic mineralization. This increase was not attenuated by treatment of HCA that stimulated mineralization. Notably, osteoclastogenesis from preosteoclastic RAW264.7 cells was enhanced by coculturing with PC-3 cells, and this enhancement was suppressed by treatment with HCA (10-1000 nM).

Methods:   We measured uPSA in serial serum samples (N = 100) collected from 20 RP cases with a third-generation ELISA (LLD of 1 pg/mL) and the fifth-generation MesoScale assay. We analyzed the PSA nadir changes to classify patients into BCR or non-BCR groups, observed the trends in PSA kinetics, and associated BCR status with clinicohistopathological features.  Results:   The ELISA could quantify PSA in only 38% of the RP samples, detecting BCR in 7 of 20 patients with PCa. The MesoScale assay quantified PSA in all samples, showing 8 of 20 patients with BCR. However, there was no significant difference between the median time to BCR detection based on ELISA (1016 days) compared with MesoScale data (949 days). Gleason scores were higher in the BCR groups compared with non-BCR. There was no significant difference for other clinicohistopathological parameters.  Conclusions:   The uPSA MesoScale technology could track miniscule changes in serum PSA in the range of 0.003-1 pg/mL in all RP cases. However, PSA kinetics and nadir at concentrations <2 pg/mL fluctuated, and increases below this range could not reliably suggest signs of BCR.

However, optimization with the state-of-the-art evolutionary algorithm MO-RV-GOMEA so far required several hours of runtime, and resulting catheter positions were not always clinically feasible. The aim of this study is to extend the optimization model and apply GPU parallelization to achieve clinically acceptable computation times. The resulting optimization procedure is compared with a previously introduced method based solely on geometric criteria, the adapted Centroidal Voronoi Tessellations (CVT) algorithm.  Methods:   Bi-objective simultaneous optimization was performed with a GPU-parallelized version of MO-RV-GOMEA. This optimization of catheter positions and dwell times was retrospectively applied to the data of 26 patients previously treated with HDR prostate brachytherapy for 8-16 catheters (steps of 2). Optimization of catheter positions using CVT was performed in seconds, after which optimization of only the dwell times using MO-RV-GOMEA was performed in 1 min.  Results:   Simultaneous optimization of catheter positions and dwell times using MO-RV-GOMEA was performed in 5 min. For 16 down to 8 catheters (steps of 2), MO-RV-GOMEA found plans satisfying the planning-aims for 20, 20, 18, 14, and 11 out of the 26 patients, respectively.

The P-value for the difference between MO-RV-GOMEA and CVT was 0.023 for 16 catheters, 0.005 for 14 catheters, and <0.001 for 12, 10, and 8 catheters.  Conclusions:   With bi-objective simultaneous optimization on a GPU, high-quality catheter positions can now be obtained within 5 min, which is clinically acceptable, but slower than CVT. For 16 catheters, the difference between MO-RV-GOMEA and CVT is clinically irrelevant. For 14 catheters and less, MO-RV-GOMEA outperforms CVT in finding plans satisfying all planning-aims.""","""['Marjolein C van der Meer', 'Peter A N Bosman', 'Yury Niatsetski', 'Tanja Alderliesten', 'Niek van Wieringen', 'Bradley R Pieters', 'Arjan Bel']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Adaptation of the CVT algorithm for catheter optimization in high dose rate brachytherapy.', 'Catheters and dose optimization using a modified CVT algorithm and multi-criteria optimization in prostate HDR brachytherapy.', 'Comparison of dose and catheter optimization algorithms in prostate high-dose-rate brachytherapy.', 'Use of three-dimensional radiation therapy planning tools and intraoperative ultrasound to evaluate high dose rate prostate brachytherapy implants.', 'Optimization in treatment planning of high dose-rate brachytherapy - Review and analysis of mathematical models.']"""

However, prostate cancer patients report a gap between information needed and information received. The importance of different information sources for treatment decision remains unclear. Thus, using the Comprehensive Model of Health Information (CMIS) framework, we assessed the antecedent factors, information carrier factors, and information-seeking activities in localized prostate cancer patients. Data were collected via semistructured one-on-one, interviews and structured survey. Men with localized prostate cancer were recruited from two urban health-care centers. Following the interview, participants completed a survey about sources that were helpful in learning about prostate cancer treatment and decision-making. The interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed, and subjected to a thematic analysis using NVivo 10. Fifty localized prostate cancer survivors completed the interviews and surveys. Important antecedent factors that were observed were age, marital status, uncertainty, anxiety, caregiver burden, and out-of-pocket expenses. We identified complexity, magnitude, and reliability as information carrier characteristics. Preferred sources for information were health providers, medical websites, and pamphlets from the doctor's office. These sources were also perceived as most helpful for decision-making. Urologists, urological oncologists, and radiation/radiation oncologists were important sources of information and helpful in decision-making. Prostate cancer patients obtained information from multiple sources. Most prostate cancer patients make patient-centered choices by incorporating personal factors and medical information. By considering factors that influence patients' treatment decisions, health-care providers can enhance the patient-centeredness of care. Multiple strategies and interventions are necessary for disseminating valid, reliable, and unbiased information to prostate cancer patients to facilitate informed decisions.""","""['Sumedha Chhatre', 'Marsha N Wittink', 'Joseph J Gallo', 'Ravishankar Jayadevappa']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Am J Mens Health""","""['Prostate Cancer Patient Perspectives on the Use of Information in Treatment Decision-Making: A Systematic Review and Qualitative Meta-synthesis.', 'What Is Important When Making Treatment Decisions in Metastatic Breast Cancer?

This study aimed to evaluate easily obtainable factors that can predict long-term UI following RARP.  Materials and methods:   A total of 315 patients who underwent RARP for localised prostatic cancer were analysed. We separated the patients into two groups, namely, the Continence group and the Incontinence group, according to the presence or absence of UI at 12 months after surgery, and we compared the patients' characteristics and operative data to identify clinical signs associated with long-term UI. Additionally, correlations between these factors and postoperative urethral function were evaluated. Urinary continence was defined as both the use of 0 pads/per day and <2 g of urine lost using the 24-hours pad weight test.  Results:   Of 315 patients, 250 (79.4%) achieved urinary continence and 65 (20.6%) had long-term UI. Age, storage-related lower urinary tract symptoms before surgery, nerve-sparing surgery and the 24-hours urine loss immediately after urethral catheter removal significantly affected long-term UI after RARP. Multivariate logistic regression analyses revealed that the 24-hours urine loss after catheter removal was a significant predictor of long-term UI. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis identified a urine loss of 330 g/d as the optimal cut-off value, which yielded 92% sensitivity and 84% specificity, and it showed significant correlations with postoperative urethral function and the time to recover urinary continence.  Conclusion:   The 24-hours urine loss immediately after urethral catheter removal may be the most reliable and useful predictor of long-term UI following RARP.""","""['Yoshihisa Matsukawa', 'Yasushi Yoshino', 'Takashi Fujita', 'Yasuhito Funahashi', 'Tsuyoshi Majima', 'Shohei Ishida', 'Masashi Kato', 'Momokazu Gotoh']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Int J Clin Pract""","""['A Pragmatic Randomized Controlled Trial Examining the Impact of the Retzius-sparing Approach on Early Urinary Continence Recovery After Robot-assisted Radical Prostatectomy.', 'Correlation of urinary loss rate after catheter removal and long-term urinary continence after robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy.', 'Prospective evaluation of urinary incontinence, voiding symptoms and quality of life after open and robot-assisted radical prostatectomy.', 'Systematic review and meta-analysis of studies reporting urinary continence recovery after robot-assisted radical prostatectomy.', 'Balancing continence function and oncological outcomes during robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP).', 'De Novo Detrusor Underactivity and Other Urodynamic Findings after Radical Prostatectomy: A Systematic Review.', 'Predictors for lower urinary tract symptoms in patients underwent radical prostatectomy: implications for postoperative nursing care.']"""

Methods:   HAROW (2008-2013) was a non-interventional, health service research study about the management of localized PCa in the community setting, with 86% of the study centers being office-based urologists. A follow-up examination of all patients who opted for AS as primary treatment was carried out. Overall, cancer-specific, and metastasis-free survival, as well as discontinuation rates, were determined.  Results:   Of 329 patients, 62.9% had very-low- and 21.3% low-risk tumours. The median follow-up was 7.7 years (IQR 4.7-9.1). Twenty-eight patients (8.5%) died unrelated to PCa, of whom 19 were under AS or watchful waiting (WW). Additionally, seven patients (2.1%) developed metastasis. The estimated 10-year overall and metastasis-free survival was 86% (95% CI 81.7-90.3) and 97% (95% CI 94.6-99.3), respectively. One hundred eighty-seven patients (56.8%) discontinued AS changing to invasive treatment: 104 radical prostatectomies (RP), 55 radiotherapies (RT), and 28 hormonal treatments (HT). Another 50 patients switched to WW. Finally, 37.4% remained alive without invasive therapy (22.2% AS and 15.2% WW). Intervention-free survival differed between the risk groups: 47.8% in the very-low-, 33.8% in the low- and 34.6% in the intermediate-/high-risk-group (p = 0.008). On multivariable analysis, PSA-density ≥ 0.2 ng/ml2 was significantly predictive for receiving invasive treatment (HR 2.55; p = 0.001).

We aimed to compare the PRECISE score with clinical progression in patients who are managed using an MRI-led AS protocol.  Methods:   A total of 553 patients on AS for low- and intermediate-risk PCa (up to Gleason score 3 + 4) who had two or more MRI scans performed between December 2005 and January 2020 were included. Overall, 2161 scans were retrospectively re-reported by a dedicated radiologist to give a PI-RADS v2 score for each scan and assess the PRECISE score for each follow-up scan. Clinical progression was defined by histological progression to ≥ Gleason score 4 + 3 (Gleason Grade Group 3) and/or initiation of active treatment. Progression-free survival was assessed using Kaplan-Meier curves and log-rank test was used to assess differences between curves.  Results:   Overall, 165/553 (30%) patients experienced the primary outcome of clinical progression (median follow-up, 74.5 months; interquartile ranges, 53-98). Of all patients, 313/553 (57%) did not show radiological progression on MRI (PRECISE 1-3), of which 296/313 (95%) had also no clinical progression.

Immunohistochemical staining, RT‑qPCR, western blotting, wound healing and CCK‑8 assays were used to detect the expression of N‑Myc and FSCN1 as well as AR and CgA at the human level and cell level. The immunohistochemical results revealed that the protein levels of N‑Myc proto‑oncogene protein (N‑Myc) and fascin (FSCN1) in PCa were significantly higher than that of hyperplastic tissues (P<0.05), and there was a weak correlation between them (P=0.002). In vitro, N‑Myc and FSCN1 were overexpressed in LNCaP and C4‑2 cell lines. The results revealed the promoting effect of N‑Myc and FSCN1 on malignant progression of PCa.

While there are several PSMA ligands available, F-18-PSMA-1007 is particularly of interest as it is not renally excreted and therefore does not impair the imaging of the pelvic area. Hence, this study aimed to investigate the F-18-PSMA-1007-PET for the primary staging of PCa and compared it to multi-parametric (mp) MRI and histopathology.  Methods:   A retrospective study was performed of men with intermediate and high-risk PCa patients that underwent a F-18-PSMA-1007-PET after mpMRI with subsequent MR-guided target biopsy (MRGB). Suspicious mpMRI lesions and F-18-PSMA-1007-PET were simultaneously reviewed on both a per patient and per-lesion basis. Results were subsequently evaluated with histopathological outcome of MRGB, and if performed, the radical prostatectomy specimen.  Results:   A total of 66 suspicious mpMRI lesions were identified in 53 patients and underwent MRGB. Two lesions had a maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) less than the mean SUVmax of healthy prostate tissue and were considered as non-PSMA-expressing. All PSMA avid tumors had higher SUVmax than the mean SUVmean of the bladder/urine, therefore all lesions were clearly distinguishable in the pelvic area. Twenty-three patients received a radical prostatectomy of which the histopathology specimens were evaluated. F-18-PSMA-1007-PET/CT correctly staged seminal vesicle invasion (i.e. pT3b) more often than mpMRI (90 vs. 76%), whereas mpMRI more accurately detected extracapsular extension (i.e. pT3a) compared to F-18-PSMA-1007-PET (90% vs 57%).  Conclusions:   The present study of a selected cohort suggest that dual imaging with mpMRI and F-18-PSMA-1007-PET may improve staging of primary PCa. F-18-PSMA-1007-PET/CT had low renal clearance, which could assist the evaluation of tumors in proximity of the bladder.""","""['Bastiaan M Privé#', 'Bas Israël#', 'Melline G M Schilham', 'Constantijn H J Muselaers', 'Patrik Zámecnik', 'Peter F A Mulders', 'J Alfred Witjes', 'Michiel Sedelaar', 'Niven Mehra', 'Fred Verzijlbergen', 'Marcel J R Janssen', 'Martin Gotthardt', 'Jelle O Barentsz', 'Inge M van Oort#', 'James Nagarajah#']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Prostate Cancer Prostatic Dis""","""['More advantages in detecting bone and soft tissue metastases from prostate cancer using 18F-PSMA PET/CT.', 'Intraindividual Comparison of 18F-PSMA-1007 PET/CT, Multiparametric MRI, and Radical Prostatectomy Specimens in Patients with Primary Prostate Cancer: A Retrospective, Proof-of-Concept Study.', 'Incremental Impact of 68\xa0GaGa-PSMA-11 PET/CT in Primary N and M Staging of Prostate Cancer Prior to Curative-Intent Surgery: a Prospective Clinical Trial in Comparison with mpMRI.', 'Diagnostic Performance and Clinical Impact of PSMA PET/CT versus mpMRI in Patients with a High Suspicion of Prostate Cancer and Previously Negative Biopsy: A Prospective Trial (PROSPET-BX).', 'Clinical aspects in the diagnosis and treatment of prostate cancer.', 'PET/CT imaging 2\xa0h after injection of 18FPSMA-1007 can lead to higher staging of prostate cancer than imaging after 1\xa0h.', 'Expanding the role of PSMA PET in active surveillance.', '68Ga-PSMA PET/CT and Prostate Cancer Diagnosis: Which SUVmax Value?', 'A Systematic Review of the Variability in Performing and Reporting Intraprostatic Prostate-specific Membrane Antigen Positron Emission Tomography in Primary Staging Studies.', 'Evolving imaging methods of prostate cancer and the emergence of magnetic resonance imaging guided ablation techniques.']"""

We hypothesized that S100A4-regulated oncogenic activity in immunosuppressed prostate tumors promotes growth of neoplastic cells, which are likely to become aggressive. In the current study, we investigated whether biopsy-S100A4 gene alteration independently predicts the outcome of disease in patients and circulatory-S100A4 is druggable target for treating immunosuppressive prostate cancer. Aided by DECIPHER-genomic test, we show biopsy-S100A4 overexpression as predictive of (i) poor ADT response and (ii) high risk of mortality in 228 radical prostatectomy-treated patients. Furthermore, analysis of tumor genome data of more than 1,000 patients with prostate cancer (PRAD/SU2C/FHCRC studies) validated the association of S100A4-alteration to poor survival and metastasis. We show that increased serum-S100A4 levels are associated to the prostate cancer progression in patients. The prerequisite for metastasis is the escape of tumor cells via vascular system. We show that extracellular-S100A4 protein as a growth factor induces vascular transmigration of prostate cancer cells and bone demineralization thus forms an ideal target for therapies for treating prostate cancer. By employing surface plasmon resonance and isothermal titration calorimetry, we show that mab6B12 antibody interacts with and neutralizes S100A4 protein. When tested for therapeutic efficacy, the mab6B12 therapy reduced the (i) osteoblastic demineralization of bone-derived MSCs, (ii) S100A4-target (NFκB/MMP9/VEGF) levels in prostate cancer cells, and (iii) tumor growth in a TRAMPC2 syngeneic mouse model.

Among the recently emerged viruses infecting humans, several target the testis (e.g., human immunodeficiency virus [HIV], Zika virus, and Ebola virus). Here, we aimed to investigate whether human testicular germ cells (TGCs) can support integration by HIV, a contemporary retrovirus that started to spread in the human population during the last century. We report that albeit alternative receptors enabled HIV-1 binding to TGCs, HIV virions failed to infect TGCs in vitro Nevertheless, exposure of TGCs to infected lymphocytes, naturally present in the testis from HIV+ men, led to HIV-1 entry, integration, and early protein expression. Similarly, cell-associated infection or bypassing viral entry led to HIV-1 integration in a spermatogonial cell line. Using DNAscope, HIV-1 and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) DNA were detected within a few TGCs in the testis from one infected patient, one rhesus macaque, and one African green monkey in vivo Molecular landscape analysis revealed that early TGCs were enriched in HIV early cofactors up to integration and had overall low antiviral defenses compared with testicular macrophages and Sertoli cells. In conclusion, our study reveals that TGCs can support the entry and integration of HIV upon cell-associated infection. This could represent a way for this contemporary virus to integrate into our germ line and become endogenous in the future, as happened during human evolution for a number of viruses.IMPORTANCE Viruses have colonized the host germ line on many occasions during evolution to eventually become endogenous. Here, we aimed at investigating whether human testicular germ cells (TGCs) can support such viral invasion by studying HIV interactions with TGCs in vitro Our results indicate that isolated primary TGCs express alternative HIV-1 receptors, allowing virion binding but not entry. However, HIV-1 entered and integrated into TGCs upon cell-associated infection and produced low levels of viral proteins. In vivo, HIV-1 and SIV DNA was detected in a few TGCs. Molecular landscape analysis showed that TGCs have overall weak antiviral defenses. Altogether, our results indicate that human TGCs can support HIV-1 early replication, including integration, suggesting potential for endogenization in future generations.""","""['Dominique Mahé', 'Giulia Matusali', 'Claire Deleage', 'Raquel L L S Alvarenga', 'Anne-Pascale Satie', 'Amélie Pagliuzza', 'Romain Mathieu', 'Sylvain Lavoué', 'Bernard Jégou', 'Luiz R de França', 'Nicolas Chomont', 'Laurent Houzet', 'Antoine D Rolland', 'Nathalie Dejucq-Rainsford']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""J Virol""","""['CXCR6-Mediated Simian Immunodeficiency Virus SIVagmSab Entry into Sabaeus African Green Monkey Lymphocytes Implicates Widespread Use of Non-CCR5 Pathways in Natural Host Infections.', 'Reduced Simian Immunodeficiency Virus Replication in Macrophages of Sooty Mangabeys Is Associated with Increased Expression of Host Restriction Factors.', 'The testis and epididymis are productively infected by SIV and SHIV in juvenile macaques during the post-acute stage of infection.', 'SIV/HIV recombinants and their use in studying biological properties.', 'SIVagm: genetic and biological features associated with replication.', 'Human Papillomavirus Genome Copy Number Is Maintained by S-Phase Amplification, Genome Loss to the Cytosol during Mitosis, and Degradation in G1 Phase.', ""'Cannibalism' of exogenous DNA sequences: The ancestral form of adaptive immunity which entails recognition of danger."", 'Human Endogenous Retroviruses: Friends and Foes in Urology Clinics.', 'Viral tropism for the testis and sexual transmission.', 'Vulnerability of The Male Reproductive System to SARS-CoV-2 Invasion: Potential Role for The Endoplasmic Reticulum Chaperone Grp78/HSPA5/BiP.']"""

However, AR reactivation inevitably drives disease progression to castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Here we demonstrate that protein arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5) functions as an epigenetic activator of AR transcription in CRPC, requiring cooperation with a methylosome subunit pICln. In vitro and in xenograft tumors in mice, targeting PRMT5 or pICln suppressed growth of CRPC cells. Full-length AR and AR-V7 transcription activation required both PRMT5 and pICln but not MEP50. This activation of transcription was accompanied by PRMT5-mediated symmetric dimethylation of H4R3 at the proximal AR promoter. Further, knockdown of PRMT5 abolished the binding of pICln (but not vice versa) to the AR proximal promoter region, suggesting that PRMT5 recruits pICln to the AR promoter to activate AR transcription. Differential gene expression analysis in 22Rv1 cells confirmed that PRMT5 and pICln both regulate the androgen signaling pathway. In addition, PRMT5 and pICln protein expression positively correlated with AR and AR-V7 protein expression in CRPC tissues and their expression was highly correlated at the mRNA level across multiple publicly available CRPC datasets. Our results suggest that targeting PRMT5 or pICln may be explored as a novel therapy for CRPC treatment by suppressing expression of AR and AR splice variants to circumvent AR reactivation.

Preclinically, statins disrupt trafficking of receptors present at the cell membrane. Membrane receptors, defined as tumor biomarkers and therapeutic targets, are often internalized by an endocytic pathway. Indeed, receptor endocytosis and recycling are dynamic mechanisms that often affect receptor density at the cell surface. In therapies using monoclonal antibodies (mAb), a downregulation in receptor density at the cell surface decreases antibody binding to the extracellular domain of the membrane receptor. Here, we determined the potential of lovastatin, simvastatin, and rosuvastatin in preclinically modulating epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) receptor density at the tumor cell surface.  Experimental design:   Small-animal PET was used to study the binding of 89Zr-labeled antibodies in ectopic xenografts. Ex vivo analyses were performed to determine changes in endocytic proteins, EGFR, and PSMA surface levels.  Results:   Acute statin treatment using lovastatin, simvastatin, or rosuvastatin enhanced tumors' avidity for the mAbs panitumumab, cetuximab, and huJ591. Statins temporarily modulated caveolin-1, cavin-1, endophilin, clathrin, and dynamin proteins in EGFR- and PSMA-overexpressing xenografts.  Conclusions:   These data show the potential of statins as pharmacologic modulators of endocytic proteins for improved tumors' accumulation of mAbs. The translational significance of these findings lies in the potential of statins to temporarily modulate the heterogeneous presence of receptors at the cell membrane, a characteristic often associated with poor response in tumors to therapeutic antibodies.""","""['Patrícia M R Pereira', 'Komal Mandleywala', 'Ashwin Ragupathi', 'Jason S Lewis']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Clin Cancer Res""","""['Noninvasive Imaging of PSMA in prostate tumors with (89)Zr-Labeled huJ591 engineered antibody fragments: the faster alternatives.', 'Potent antitumor activity of an auristatin-conjugated, fully human monoclonal antibody to prostate-specific membrane antigen.', 'In vitro and in vivo responses of advanced prostate tumors to PSMA ADC, an auristatin-conjugated antibody to prostate-specific membrane antigen.', 'Targeting Nanomedicines to Prostate Cancer: Evaluation of Specificity of Ligands to Two Different Receptors In Vivo.', 'Radiolabeled mAbs as Molecular Imaging and/or Therapy Agents Targeting PSMA.', 'Metformin-Induced Receptor Turnover Alters Antibody Accumulation in HER-Expressing Tumors.', 'Endocytosis in cancer and cancer therapy.', 'Statins enhance the efficacy of HER2-targeting radioligand therapy in drug-resistant gastric cancers.', 'Statin drugs enhance responses to immune checkpoint blockade in head and neck cancer models.', 'Drug Repurposing: A New Hope in Drug Discovery for Prostate Cancer.']"""

Single-cell mRNA-sequencing analysis of the hm-cells from metastatic prostate cancer patients revealed that approximately 10% were canonical EpCAM+ hm-CTCs, 3% were EpCAM- hm-CTCs with up-regulation of prostate-related genes, and 87% were hm-CStCs with profiles characteristic for cancer-associated fibroblasts, mesenchymal stem cells, and endothelial cells. Kaplan-Meier analysis shows that metastatic prostate cancer patients with more than five hm-cells have a significantly poorer survival probability than those with zero to five hm-cells.

Understanding the molecular mechanisms that promote quiescence of tumor cells could help identify therapies to eliminate these cells. Significantly, recent studies have determined that the function of SOX2 in cancer cells is highly dose dependent. Specifically, SOX2 levels in tumor cells are optimized to promote tumor growth: knocking down or elevating SOX2 inhibits proliferation. Furthermore, recent studies have shown that quiescent tumor cells express higher levels of SOX2 compared to adjacent proliferating cells. Currently, the mechanisms through which elevated levels of SOX2 restrict tumor cell proliferation have not been characterized.  Methods:   To understand how elevated levels of SOX2 restrict the proliferation of tumor cells, we engineered diverse types of tumor cells for inducible overexpression of SOX2. Using these cells, we examined the effects of elevating SOX2 on their proliferation, both in vitro and in vivo. In addition, we examined how elevating SOX2 influences their expression of cyclins, cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), and p27Kip1.  Results:   Elevating SOX2 in diverse tumor cell types led to growth inhibition in vitro. Significantly, elevating SOX2 in vivo in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, medulloblastoma, and prostate cancer cells induced a reversible state of tumor growth arrest. In all three tumor types, elevation of SOX2 in vivo quickly halted tumor growth. Remarkably, tumor growth resumed rapidly when SOX2 returned to endogenous levels. We also determined that elevation of SOX2 in six tumor cell lines decreased the levels of cyclins and CDKs that control each phase of the cell cycle, while upregulating p27Kip1.  Conclusions:   Our findings indicate that elevating SOX2 above endogenous levels in a diverse set of tumor cell types leads to growth inhibition both in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, our findings indicate that SOX2 can function as a master regulator by controlling the expression of a broad spectrum of cell cycle machinery. Importantly, our SOX2-inducible tumor studies provide a novel model system for investigating the molecular mechanisms by which elevated levels of SOX2 restrict cell proliferation and tumor growth.""","""['Ethan P Metz', 'Erin L Wuebben', 'Phillip J Wilder', 'Jesse L Cox', 'Kaustubh Datta', 'Donald Coulter', 'Angie Rizzino']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""BMC Cancer""","""['Elevating SOX2 in prostate tumor cells upregulates expression of neuroendocrine genes, but does not reduce the inhibitory effects of enzalutamide.', 'Regulation of p27Kip1 by Sox2 maintains quiescence of inner pillar cells in the murine auditory sensory epithelium.', 'Elevating SOX2 levels deleteriously affects the growth of medulloblastoma and glioblastoma cells.', 'Molecular mechanisms controlling the cell cycle: fundamental aspects and implications for oncology.', 'Cyclins and related kinases in cancer cells.', 'Potassium Ion Channels in Malignant Central Nervous System Cancers.', 'Biomarkers of Cancer Stem Cells for Experimental Research and Clinical Application.', 'Elevating SOX2 Downregulates MYC through a SOX2:MYC Signaling Axis and Induces a Slowly Cycling Proliferative State in Human Tumor Cells.', 'SOX2 mediates metabolic reprogramming of prostate cancer cells.', 'Subgroup-Specific Diagnostic, Prognostic, and Predictive Markers Influencing Pediatric Medulloblastoma Treatment.']"""

Methods:   Data for incident cases diagnosed in 1997-2016 and followed up through December 31, 2017 were obtained from the Azores Cancer Registry. Data for cancer deaths that occurred in 1991-2016 were obtained from Statistics Portugal. To estimate temporal trends, we applied a joinpoint model to age-adjusted rates. We estimated five-year net survival within the framework of relative survival using the Pohar-Perme estimator and predicted the number of cases and deaths in 2025.  Results:   In men, incidence and mortality decreased for stomach, larynx, and prostate cancer. In women, mortality decreased for breast and cervical cancer. Five-year relative survival improved for several cancers, with the most pronounced improvements for prostate cancer in men and colorectal cancer in women (24.1 and 27.9 percentage point absolute increase, respectively). Conversely, incidence and mortality increased for colorectal cancer in men and lung cancer in women. The incidence and mortality burdens are both expected to increase in 2025.  Conclusion:   Overall, progress against cancer in the Azores has been mixed, and much of the progress has been driven by advances in treatment.

Although multiple immunodeficient rodent strains are available, some important human cancer cell lines exhibit poor tumor growth and high variability in those models. The VCaP prostate cancer model is one such cell line that engrafts unreliably and grows irregularly in existing models but displays over 90% engraftment rate in the SRG rat with uniform growth kinetics. Since rats can support much larger tumors than mice, the SRG rat is an attractive host for PDX establishment. Surgically resected NSCLC tissue from nine patients were implanted in SRG rats, seven of which engrafted and grew for an overall success rate of 78%. These developed into a large tumor volume, over 20,000 mm3 in the first passage, which would provide an ample source of tissue for characterization and/or subsequent passage into NSG mice for drug efficacy studies.

We aim to evaluate the agreement between radiologic tumor size and pathological tumor size, and identify predictors of pathological tumor size.  Materials and methods:   This single arm study cohort included all consecutive patients with biopsy proven prostate cancer and a corresponding PI-RADS®v2 3 or greater index tumor on multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging who subsequently underwent radical prostatectomy. Radiologic tumor size was defined as maximum tumor diameter on multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging and compared to whole mount histopathology tumor correlates. The difference between radiologic tumor size and pathological tumor size was assessed, and clinical, pathological and radiographic predictors of pathological tumor size were examined.  Results:   A total of 461 consecutive lesions in 441 men were included for statistical analysis. Mean radiologic tumor size and pathological tumor size was 1.57 and 2.37 cm, respectively (p <0.001). Radiologic tumor size consistently underestimated pathological tumor size regardless of the preoperative covariates, and the degree of underestimation increased with smaller radiologic tumor size and lower PI-RADSv2 scores. Pathological tumor size was significantly larger for biopsy Gleason Grade Group (GG) 5 compared to GG1 (mean change 0.37 cm, p=0.014), PI-RADSv2 5 lesions compared to PI-RADSv2 4 (mean change 0.26, p=0.006) and higher prostate specific antigen density. The correlations between radiologic tumor size vs pathological tumor size according to biopsy GG and radiologic covariates were generally low with correlation coefficients ranging between 0.1 and 0.65.  Conclusions:   Multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging frequently underestimates pathological tumor size and the degree of underestimation increases with smaller radiologic tumor size and lower PI-RADSv2 scores. Therefore, a larger ablation margin may be required for smaller tumors and lesions with lower PI-RADSv2 scores. These variables must be considered when estimating treatment margins in focal therapy.""","""['Aydin Pooli', 'David C Johnson', 'Joseph Shirk', 'Daniela Markovic', 'Taylor Y Sadun', 'Anthony E Sisk Jr', 'Amirhossein Mohammadian Bajgiran', 'Sohrab Afshari Mirak', 'Ely R Felker', 'Alexa K Hughes', 'Steven S Raman', 'Robert E Reiter']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""J Urol""","""['Editorial Comment.', '3T multiparametric MR imaging, PIRADSv2-based detection of index prostate cancer lesions in the transition zone and the peripheral zone using whole mount histopathology as reference standard.', 'Pathological and 3 Tesla Volumetric Magnetic Resonance Imaging Predictors of Biochemical Recurrence after Robotic Assisted Radical Prostatectomy: Correlation with Whole Mount Histopathology.', 'PI-RADS version 2 for prediction of pathological downgrading after radical prostatectomy: a preliminary study in patients with biopsy-proven Gleason Score 7 (3+4) prostate cancer.', 'Added Clinical Value of Whole-mount Histopathology of Radical Prostatectomy Specimens: A Collaborative Review.', 'PI-RADSv2.1: Current status.', 'Prediction and Mapping of Intraprostatic Tumor Extent with Artificial Intelligence.', 'Novel Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging-Based Deep Learning and Clinical Parameter Integration for the Prediction of Long-Term Biochemical Recurrence-Free Survival in Prostate Cancer after Radical Prostatectomy.', 'Future of prostate imaging: Artificial intelligence in assessing prostatic magnetic resonance imaging.', 'Evolving imaging methods of prostate cancer and the emergence of magnetic resonance imaging guided ablation techniques.', 'The use of advanced imaging in guiding the further investigation and treatment of primary prostate cancer.']"""

Materials and methods:   A total of 629 men biopsied between February 2015 and September 2018 met PRECISION inclusion criteria. Men with PI-RADS™ 1-2 magnetic resonance imaging were only biopsied if high clinical suspicion for cancer. Missed cancers were defined as prostate cancer identified uniquely on systematic biopsy in men with PI-RADS 3-5 magnetic resonance imaging, or on either systematic biopsy or magnetic resonance imaging-targeted prostate biopsy in men with PI-RADS 1-2 magnetic resonance imaging. Outcomes included 1) clinically significant prostate cancer, Gleason grade group 2 or greater, detection rate, 2) missed clinically significant prostate cancer rate upon application of PRECISION biopsy strategy, 3) Gleason grade group distribution, core size, spatial orientation and oncologic risk among missed cancers.  Results:   Application of the PRECISION biopsy strategy to the study cohort resulted in avoidance of biopsy in 28%, similar magnetic resonance imaging-targeted prostate biopsy detection rate to PRECISION, reduction of Gleason grade group 1 detection rate by 60% and reduction of clinically significant prostate cancer detection rate by 19%. Missed clinically significant prostate cancers were often smaller than 6 mm (54.5%), Gleason grade group 2 (67.3%) and low risk by clinical nomogram (74.6%). Gleason grade group 1 cancers identified uniquely on systematic biopsy were often contralateral to magnetic resonance imaging target (46.4%), while missed clinically significant prostate cancer was predominantly ipsilateral (81%). Limitations include biopsy of only men with high risk clinical features among PI-RADS 1-2 magnetic resonance imaging, potentially overestimating the clinically significant prostate cancer detection rate.  Conclusions:   The study cohort demonstrated generalizability of PRECISION findings. Applying the PRECISION biopsy strategy greatly reduces Gleason grade group 1 detection rate, while missing a small number of clinically significant prostate cancer, typically small volume, low risk, and Gleason grade group 2. Missed clinically significant prostate cancer is predominantly ipsilateral to magnetic resonance imaging target, possibly representing targeting error.""","""['Zachary Feuer', 'Xiaosong Meng', 'Andrew B Rosenkrantz', 'Veeru Kasivisvanathan', 'Caroline M Moore', 'Richard Huang', 'Fang-Ming Deng', 'Herbert Lepor', 'James S Wysock', 'William C Huang', 'Samir S Taneja']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""J Urol""","""['Is a targeted biopsy-only approach for prostate cancer diagnosis ready for the prime time?', 'Editorial Comment.', 'Negative Prebiopsy Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Risk of Significant Prostate Cancer: Baseline and Long-Term Followup Results.', 'Comparative analysis of transperineal template saturation prostate biopsy versus magnetic resonance imaging targeted biopsy with magnetic resonance imaging-ultrasound fusion guidance.', 'Validation of Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System Version 2 for the Detection of Prostate Cancer.', 'Prostate Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Magnetic Resonance Imaging Targeted Biopsy in Patients with a Prior Negative Biopsy: A Consensus Statement by AUA and SAR.', 'Image-guided prostate biopsy using magnetic resonance imaging-derived targets: a systematic review.', 'A prospective study of cancer detection rates following early repeat imaging and biopsy of PI-RADS 4 and 5 regions of interest exhibiting no clinically significant prostate cancer on prior biopsy.', 'An Magnetic Resonance Imaging-directed Targeted-plus-perilesional Biopsy Approach for Prostate Cancer Diagnosis: ""Less Is More"".', 'Axumin (18F-Fluciclovine) PET imaging in men exhibiting no clinically significant cancer on initial negative biopsy of PI-RADS 4 and 5 regions of interest.', 'Real-world use of MRI for risk stratification prior to prostate biopsy.', 'Diagnostic Performance of a Magnetic Resonance Imaging-directed Targeted plus Regional Biopsy Approach in Prostate Cancer Diagnosis: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.']"""

Objective:   To determine whether patients with higher-risk prostate cancer residing in Medicaid expansion states were more likely to receive treatment after expansion compared with patients in states electing not to pursue Medicaid expansion.  Design, setting, and participants:   This population-based cohort study included 15 332 patients diagnosed with higher-risk prostate cancer (ie, grade group >2; grade group 2 with prostate-specific antigen levels >10 ng/mL; or grade group 1 with prostate-specific antigen levels >20 ng/mL) from January 2010 to December 2016 aged 50 to 64 years who were candidates for definitive treatment. Patients residing in states that partially expanded Medicaid coverage before 2010 (ie, California and Connecticut) and those with diagnosis not confirmed by histology were excluded. Data were collected from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program. Data were analyzed between August and December 2019.  Exposure:   State-level Medicaid expansion status.  Main outcomes and measures:   Insurance status before and after expansion, treatment with prostatectomy or radiation therapy (including brachytherapy), treatment trends over time.  Results:   Of 15 332 patients, 7811 (50.9%) lived in expansion states (mean [SD] age, 59.1 [3.8] years; 5532 [71.9%] non-Hispanic White), and 7521 (49.1%) lived in nonexpansion states (mean [SD] age, 59.0 [3.9] years; 3912 [52.1%] non-Hispanic White). Residence in an expansion state was associated with higher pre-expansion levels of Medicaid coverage (292 [8.1%] vs 161 [3.8%]; odds ratio [OR], 2.12; 95% CI, 1.78 to 2.53) and lower likelihood of being uninsured (136 [3.2%] vs 38 [1.1%]; OR, 0.28; 95% CI, 0.15 to 0.54). After expansion, there was no difference in trends in treatment receipt between expansion and nonexpansion states (change, -0.39%; 95% CI, -0.11% to 0.28%; P = .25). Patients with private or Medicare coverage were more likely to receive treatment vs those with Medicaid or no coverage across racial/ethnic groups (eg, Black patients with coverage: OR, 2.30; 95% CI, 1.68 to 3.10; Black patients with no coverage: OR, 1.48; 95% CI, 1.09 to 2.00; P < .001). Medicaid patients were not more likely to be treated compared with those without insurance (737 [78.8%] vs 435 [79.5%]; OR, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.76 to 1.25).  Conclusions and relevance:   In this cohort study, state-level expansion of Medicaid was associated with increased Medicaid coverage for men with higher-risk prostate tumors but did not appear to affect treatment patterns at a population level. This may be related to the finding that Medicaid coverage was not associated with increased treatment rates compared with those without insurance.""","""['Wen Liu', 'Michael Goodman', 'Christopher P Filson']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""JAMA Netw Open""","""['Associations of Medicaid Expansion With Insurance Coverage, Stage at Diagnosis, and Treatment Among Patients With Genitourinary Malignant Neoplasms.', 'Association of Medicaid Expansion Under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act With Use of Long-term Care.', 'Association of Medicaid Expansion With Health Insurance Coverage Among Persons With a Disability.', 'The US Medicaid Program: Coverage, Financing, Reforms, and Implications for Health Equity.', 'Understanding the Implications of Medicaid Expansion for Cancer Care in the US: A Review.', 'Five-year survival of patients with late-stage prostate cancer: comparison of the Military Health System and the U.S. general population.', 'Racial disparities in prostate cancer: A complex interplay between socioeconomic inequities and genomics.']"""

Cancer cells are known for their propensity to use glucose-dependent glycolytic pathway instead of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation for energy generation even in the presence of oxygen, a phenomenon known as Warburg effect. The type II beta regulatory subunit of protein kinase A (PKA), PRKAR2B, is highly expressed in castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) and contributes to tumour growth and metastasis. However, whether PRKAR2B regulates glucose metabolism in prostate cancer remains largely unknown.  Materials and methods:   Loss-of-function and gain-of-function studies were used to investigate the regulatory role of PRKAR2B in aerobic glycolysis. Real-time qPCR, Western blotting, luciferase reporter assay and chromatin immunoprecipitation were employed to determine the underlying mechanisms.  Results:   PRKAR2B was sufficient to enhance the Warburg effect as demonstrated by glucose consumption, lactate production and extracellular acidification rate. Mechanistically, loss-of-function and gain-of-function studies showed that PRKAR2B was critically involved in the tumour growth of prostate cancer. PRKAR2B was able to increase the expression level of hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α), which is a key mediator of the Warburg effect. Moreover, we uncovered that HIF-1α is a key transcription factor responsible for inducing PRKAR2B expression in prostate cancer. Importantly, inhibition of glycolysis by the glycolytic inhibitor 2-deoxy-d-glucose (2-DG) or replacement of glucose in the culture medium with galactose (which has a much lower rate than glucose entry into glycolysis) largely compromised PRKAR2B-mediated tumour-promoting effect. Similar phenomenon was noticed by genetic silencing of HIF-1α.  Conclusions:   Our study identified that PRKAR2B-HIF-1α loop enhances the Warburg effect to enable growth advantage in prostate cancer.""","""['Lei Xia', 'Jian Sun', 'Shaowei Xie', 'Chenfei Chi', 'Yinjie Zhu', 'Jiahua Pan', 'Baijun Dong', 'Yiran Huang', 'Weiliang Xia', 'Jianjun Sha', 'Wei Xue']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Cell Prolif""","""['Transcriptional regulation of PRKAR2B by miR-200b-3p/200c-3p and XBP1 in human prostate cancer.', 'MiR-3662 suppresses hepatocellular carcinoma growth through inhibition of HIF-1α-mediated Warburg effect.', 'Balanophorin B inhibited glycolysis with the involvement of HIF-1α.', 'HIF-1alpha modulates energy metabolism in cancer cells by inducing over-expression of specific glycolytic isoforms.', 'The Warburg effect: essential part of metabolic reprogramming and central contributor to cancer progression.', 'Dysregulation of hypoxia-inducible factor 1α in the sympathetic nervous system accelerates diabetic cardiomyopathy.', 'Hypoxia promotes conversion to a stem cell phenotype in prostate cancer cells by activating HIF-1α/Notch1 signaling pathway.', 'The single-cell landscape of cystic echinococcosis in different stages provided insights into endothelial and immune cell heterogeneity.', 'Docetaxel suppressed cell proliferation through Smad3/HIF-1α-mediated glycolysis in prostate cancer cells.', 'Identification of diagnostic gene biomarkers and immune infiltration in patients with diabetic kidney disease using machine learning strategies and bioinformatic analysis.']"""

Methods:   Australian Medicare published statistics from 1 July 2007 to 30 June 2019 were obtained from publically available databases for prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing, prostate biopsy, and mpMRIp. Analysis was divided into three time periods broadly based on availability of mpMRI to the Australian public: 2007-2012 (no mpMRIp), 2012-2018 (mpMRIp available, privately funded), and 2018-2019 (mpMRIp available with Medicare funding). Introduction of mpMRIp was hypothesised to reduce the number of prostate biopsies performed. PSA testing numbers were used as a control. The economics model, proposed by the Medical Services Advisory Committee (MSAC), was analysed for cost savings.  Results:   Accounting for variations in PSA testing, the introduction of mpMRIp from 2012 coincided with a reduction in the number of prostate biopsies by an average of 354.7/month (95% CI 175, 534.4; P < 0.001). Whilst the number of mpMRIp performed for the initial 12 months was underestimated by the MSAC at 38 470 vs 20 149 (+$8.3 million Australian dollars), we estimate the annual savings from reduced number biopsies and biopsy-associated complications to be $13.2 ± 9.6 million.  Conclusion:   Availability of mpMRIp in Australia has correlated with a significant reduction in prostate biopsy rates, with an estimated annual saving of $13.2 ± 9.6 million.

In phase I, we conducted depth interviews with survivors of breast (n = 34), prostate (n = 4), and colorectal (n = 6) cancers to develop a health coaching prototype. In phase II, we utilized user-testing interviews (n = 9) to test and refine the health coaching prototype. For both phases, we used a template analysis independently coding each interview. In phase I, majority (n = 34, 81%) of survivors were positive about the utility of health coaching.

The prototype was developed and user-tested and refined in phase III to address the following concerns: (1) the amount of time for calls, (2) density of reading materials, (3) clarity about health coaches' role, (4) customization.

After integrating the signal amplification effect of the mass cumulative hydrogel and the LSPR effect of AuNPs with high specific aptamer, the SPRi biosensor for exosome detection exhibited a wide linear range from 1.00 × 105 to 1.00 × 107 particles/mL with a limit of detection of 1.00 × 105 particles/mL. Most importantly, with a strong correlation between the SPRi signal and the t-PSA value measured by the clinical chemiluminescence immunoassay, this biosensor displayed excellent practicability for human serum analysis, which exhibits great potential applications in disease diagnosis and bioanalysis. Prostate cancer has been one of the most threatening diseases in human life and health nowadays. In particular, as cancer metastasizes, it is more likely to cause fracture, paraplegia, and even fatal consequences. However, the predominant t-PSA test needs further improvement for the deficiencies of limited specificity and sensitivity, which is prone to false positive. As one of the noninvasive markers of liquid biopsies, exosome has the potential to be a substitute for t-PSA, which can provide specific and predictive information in disease diagnosis and prognosis. Herein, based on the hydrogel-AuNP supramolecular sphere (H-Au), a label-free and real-time surface plasmon resonance biosensor has been developed for highly sensitive and specific detection of prostate cancer cell-derived exosomes. After integrating the signal amplification effect of mass cumulative hydrogel and LSPR effect of AuNPs with high specific aptamer, this developed SPRi biosensor for exosome detection exhibited a wide linear range from 1.00 × 105 to 1.00 × 107 particles/mL with a limit of detection down to 1.00 × 105 particles/mL. Most importantly, with a strong correlation between the SPRi signal and the t-PSA value measured by the clinical chemiluminescence immunoassay, this biosensor displayed excellent practicability in human serum, which exhibited great potential applications in disease diagnosis and bioanalysis.""","""['Wenqin Chen', 'Jia Li', 'Xiaotong Wei', 'Yunpeng Fan', 'Husun Qian', 'Siqiao Li', 'Yu Xiang', 'Shijia Ding']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Mikrochim Acta""","""['Surface plasmon resonance biosensor for exosome detection based on reformative tyramine signal amplification activated by molecular aptamer beacon.', 'In Situ Formation of Gold Nanoparticles Decorated Ti3C2 MXenes Nanoprobe for Highly Sensitive Electrogenerated Chemiluminescence Detection of Exosomes and Their Surface Proteins.', 'An enzyme-free and label-free surface plasmon resonance biosensor for ultrasensitive detection of fusion gene based on DNA self-assembly hydrogel with streptavidin encapsulation.', 'Strategies for Surface Design in Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) Sensing.', 'Recent Advances in Exosomal Protein Detection Via Liquid Biopsy Biosensors for Cancer Screening, Diagnosis, and Prognosis.', 'Current applications of nanomaterials in urinary system tumors.', 'Nanomaterials for Molecular Detection and Analysis of Extracellular Vesicles.', 'Extracellular vesicles and particles impact the systemic landscape of cancer.', 'Enhanced detection sensitivity through enzyme-induced precipitate accumulation in LSPR-active nano-valleys.', 'Biorecognition Engineering Technologies for Cancer Diagnosis: A Systematic Literature Review of Non-Conventional and Plausible Sensor Development Methods.']"""

Methods:   Nine 68Ga-PSMA-11 and nine 18F-PSMA-1007 PET scans including GTV delineations of four expert teams (GTVmanual) and a majority-voted GTV (GTVmajority) were assessed with respect to a registered histopathological GTV (GTVhisto) as the gold standard reference. The standard uptake values (SUVs) per voxel were converted to a percentage (SUV%) relative to the SUVmax. The statistically optimised SUV% threshold (SOST) was defined as those that maximises accuracy for threshold-based contouring. A leave-one-out cross-validation receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was performed to determine the SOST for each tracer. The SOST analysis was performed twice, first using the GTVhisto contour as training structure (GTVSOST-H) and second using the GTVmajority contour as training structure (GTVSOST-MA) to correct for any limited misregistration. The accuracy of both GTVSOST-H and GTVSOST-MA was calculated relative to GTVhisto in the 'leave-one-out' patient of each fold and compared with the accuracy of GTVmanual.  Results:   ROC curve analysis for 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET revealed a median threshold of 25 SUV% (range, 22-27 SUV%) and 41 SUV% (40-43 SUV%) for GTVSOST-H and GTVSOST-MA, respectively. For 18F-PSMA-1007 PET, a median threshold of 42 SUV% (39-45 SUV%) for GTVSOST-H and 44 SUV% (42-45 SUV%) for GTVSOST-MA was found. A significant pairwise difference was observed when comparing the accuracy of the GTVSOST-H contours with the median accuracy of the GTVmanual contours (median, - 2.5%; IQR, - 26.5-0.2%; p = 0.020), whereas no significant pairwise difference was found for the GTVSOST-MA contours (median, - 0.3%; IQR, - 4.4-0.6%; p = 0.199).  Conclusions:   Threshold-based contouring using GTVmajority-trained SOSTs achieves an accuracy comparable with manual contours in delineating GTVhisto. The median SOSTs of 41 SUV% for 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET and 44 SUV% for 18F-PSMA-1007 PET form a base for tracer-specific window levelling.

However, how this molecule promotes metastasis and invasion in PCa is still unclear.  Methods:   The relationship between HOTAIR and hepatocellular adhesion molecule (hepaCAM) in PCa was identified by immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence, plasmid transfection, quantitative real-time PCR and immunoblotting. The regulatory effects of HOTAIR on hepaCAM and MAPK signalling and their key roles in PCa metastasis were investigated in vitro.  Results:   The expression of HOTAIR was inversely correlated with hepaCAM in the blood and tissue of PCa patients. Here, hepaCAM was identified as a novel target gene of HOTAIR and was critical for the invasiveness of PCa. HOTAIR recruited PRC2 to the hepaCAM promoter, resulting in high levels of H3K27me3 and the absence of hepaCAM with an abnormally activated MAPK pathway. Both HOTAIR depletion and EZH2 inhibition could induce hepaCAM re-expression with inhibitory MAPK signalling and decrease the invasive and metastatic capabilities of PCa cells.  Conclusions:   This study demonstrates that HOTAIR promotes invasion and metastasis of PCa by decreasing the inhibitory effect of hepaCAM on MAPK signalling. Therefore, the HOTAIR/hepaCAM/MAPK axis may provide a new avenue towards therapeutic strategies and prognostic indicators for advanced prostate cancer.""","""['Ting Li#', 'Nanjing Liu#', 'Yingying Gao', 'Zhen Quan', 'Yanni Hao', 'Chaowen Yu', 'Luo Li', 'Mengjuan Yuan', 'Lingfang Niu', 'Chunli Luo', 'Xiaohou Wu']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Br J Cancer""","""['Involvement of aberrantly activated HOTAIR/EZH2/miR-193a feedback loop in progression of prostate cancer.', 'HOX transcript antisense intergenic RNA represses E-cadherin expression by binding to EZH2 in gastric cancer.', 'Long noncoding RNA HOTAIR promotes invasion of breast cancer cells through chondroitin sulfotransferase CHST15.', 'Long noncoding RNA HOTAIR involvement in cancer.', 'Progress of HOTAIR-microRNA in hepatocellular carcinoma.', 'Comprehensive analysis of the FOXA1-related ceRNA network and identification of the MAGI2-AS3/DUSP2 axis as a prognostic biomarker in prostate cancer.', 'HOTAIR: a potential metastatic, drug-resistant and prognostic regulator of breast cancer.', 'HOTAIR as a diagnostic and prognostic biomarker of gastrointestinal cancers: an updated meta-analysis and bioinformatics analysis based on TCGA data.', 'Oncogenic Long Noncoding RNAs in Prostate Cancer, Osteosarcoma, and Metastasis.', 'Long non-coding RNA in prostate cancer.']"""

Metformin, a drug that has been used to treat type 2 diabetes, was found to have antineoplastic activity in different cancers. Herein, we report that the combination of metformin and the EZH2 inhibitor GSK126 exerts synergistic inhibition on prostate cancer cell growth, both in vitro and in vivo Mechanistically, we identify that metformin can reduce EZH2 expression through upregulating miR-26a-5p, which is antagonized by androgen receptor (AR). Furthermore, we show that AR binds to the promoter of miR-26a-5p and suppresses its transcription. Although metformin can remove AR from the miR-26a-5p promoter, the interaction between AR and EZH2, which usually exists in androgen-refractory prostate cancer cells, strongly impedes the removal. However, GSK126 can inhibit the methyltransferase-dependent interaction between AR and EZH2, thus restoring metformin's efficacy in androgen-refractory prostate cancer cells. Collectively, our finding suggests that the combination of metformin and GSK126 would be an effective approach for future prostate cancer therapy, and particularly effective for AR-positive castration-resistant prostate cancer.""","""['Yifan Kong', 'Yanquan Zhang', 'Fengyi Mao', 'Zhuangzhuang Zhang', 'Zhiguo Li', 'Ruixin Wang', 'Jinghui Liu', 'Xiaoqi Liu']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Mol Cancer Ther""","""['Dual targeting of EZH2 and androgen receptor as a novel therapy for castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Inhibition of enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) overcomes enzalutamide resistance in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Inhibition of EZH2 by chemo- and radiotherapy agents and small molecule inhibitors induces cell death in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Finding an easy way to harmonize: a review of advances in clinical research and combination strategies of EZH2 inhibitors.', 'Repurposing of Metformin for Cancer Therapy: Updated Patent and Literature Review.', 'Identification of a polycomb group-related gene signature for predicting prognosis and immunotherapy efficacy in lung adenocarcinoma.', 'The roles of EZH2 in cancer and its inhibitors.', 'EZH2 as a Prognostic Factor and Its Immune Implication with Molecular Characterization in Prostate Cancer: An Integrated Multi-Omics in Silico Analysis.', 'PRC2-Mediated Epigenetic Suppression of Type I IFN-STAT2 Signaling Impairs Antitumor Immunity in Luminal Breast Cancer.', 'Metformin regulates multiple signaling pathways within castration-resistant human prostate cancer cells.']"""

Despite definitive therapy, many patients will have disease recurrence. Imaging has the potential to better define characteristics of response and resistance. In this study, we evaluated prostate multiparametric MRI (mpMRI) before and after neoadjuvant enzalutamide plus ADT.  Patients and methods:   Men with localized intermediate- or high-risk prostate cancer underwent a baseline mpMRI and mpMRI-targeted biopsy followed by a second mpMRI after 6 months of enzalutamide and ADT prior to RP. Specimens were sectioned in the same plane as mpMRI using patient-specific 3D-printed molds to permit mpMRI-targeted biopsies to be compared with the same lesion from the RP. Specimens were analyzed for imaging and histologic correlates of response.  Results:   Of 39 patients enrolled, 36 completed imaging and RP. Most patients (92%) had high-risk disease. Fifty-eight lesions were detected on baseline mpMRI, of which 40 (69%) remained measurable at 6-month follow-up imaging. Fifty-five of 59 lesions (93%) demonstrated >50% volume reduction on posttreatment mpMRI. Three of 59 lesions (5%) demonstrated growth in size at follow-up imaging, with two lesions increasing more than 3-fold in volume. On whole-mount pathology, 15 patients demonstrated minimal residual disease (MRD) of <0.05 cc or pathologic complete response. Low initial mpMRI relative tumor burden was most predictive of MRD on final pathology.  Conclusions:   Low relative lesion volume at baseline mpMRI was predictive of pathologic response. A subset of patients had limited response.

We aimed to validate this nomogram externally by analyzing 566 patients harboring prostate cancer diagnosed on MRI-targeted biopsy followed by radical prostatectomy. At final pathology, 37% and 12% patients had ECE and SVI, respectively. Performance of the nomogram, in comparison with the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) model and Partin tables, was evaluated using discrimination, calibration, and decision curve analysis. Regarding ECE prediction, the nomogram showed higher discrimination (71.8% vs 69.8%, p = 0.3 and 71.8% vs 61.3%, p < 0.001), and similar miscalibration and net benefit for probability threshold above 30% when compared with MSKCC model and Partin tables, respectively. Performance of the nomogram with regard to SVI was comparable in terms of discrimination (68.5% vs 70.4% vs 67.8%, p ≥ 0.6), presenting a slight overestimation on calibration plots and a net benefit for probability threshold above 7.5%. This is the first multicentric study that externally validates a nomogram predicting ECE and SVI in patients diagnosed with MRI-targeted biopsy. Its performance was less optimistic than expected, and implementation of MRI in this setting was not associated with a clear improvement in patient selection and clinical usefulness when compared with available models. We proposed an updated version of the nomogram predicting ECE using the recalibration method, which leads to an improvement in its performance and needs to be validated in another external set.

We aimed to shed light on this association by using the integrated data at country level.  Methods:   We correlated elemental (nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P)) compositions and stoichiometries (N:P ratios), molecular (proteins) and energetic traits (kilocalories) of food of animal (terrestrial or aquatic) and vegetable origin, and alcoholic beverages with cancer prevalence and mortality and life expectancy (LE) at birth at the country level. We used the official databases of United Nations (UN), Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), World Bank, World Health Organization (WHO), U.S. Department of Agriculture, U.S. Department of Health, and Eurobarometer, while also considering other possibly involved variables such as income, mean age, or human development index of each country.  Results:   The per capita intakes of N, P, protein, and total intake from terrestrial animals, and especially alcohol were significantly and positively associated with prevalence and mortality from total, colon, lung, breast, and prostate cancers. In contrast, high per capita intakes of vegetable N, P, N:P, protein, and total plant intake exhibited negative relationships with cancer prevalence and mortality. However, a high LE at birth, especially in underdeveloped countries was more strongly correlated with a higher intake of food, independent of its animal or vegetable origin, than with other variables, such as higher income or the human development index.  Conclusions:   Our analyses, thus, yielded four generally consistent conclusions. First, the excessive intake of terrestrial animal food, especially the levels of protein, N, and P, is associated with higher prevalence of cancer, whereas equivalent intake from vegetables is associated with lower prevalence. Second, no consistent relationship was found for food N:P ratio and cancer prevalence. Third, the consumption of alcoholic beverages correlates with prevalence and mortality by malignant neoplasms. Fourth, in underdeveloped countries, reducing famine has a greater positive impact on health and LE than a healthier diet.""","""['Josep Penuelas', 'Tamás Krisztin', 'Michael Obersteiner', 'Florian Huber', 'Hannes Winner', 'Ivan A Janssens', 'Philippe Ciais', 'Jordi Sardans']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Int J Environ Res Public Health""","""['Worldwide incidence of hip fracture in elderly women: relation to consumption of animal and vegetable foods.', 'Discretionary food and beverage consumption and its association with demographic characteristics, weight status, and fruit and vegetable intakes in Australian adults.', 'Evaluation of food consumption and dietary patterns in Spain by the Food Consumption Survey: updated information.', 'Organochlorine pesticides and polychlorinated biphenyls in foodstuffs from Asian and oceanic countries.', 'Fruit and vegetable intake and the risk of cardiovascular disease, total cancer and all-cause mortality-a systematic review and dose-response meta-analysis of prospective studies.', 'Association between Alcohol Intake and Prostate Cancer Mortality and Survival.', 'Risk Factors and Pathogenic Mechanism for Secondary Primary Lung Cancer \u2029in Breast Cancer Patients: A Review.', 'Alcohol and Prostate Cancer: Time to Draw Conclusions.', 'Association of plant-based diet index with prostate cancer risk.', 'Impacts from Economic Development and Environmental Factors on Life Expectancy: A Comparative Study Based on Data from Both Developed and Developing Countries from 2004 to 2016.']"""

Here, we propose that neuropeptide Y (NPY) nerves are key regulators of cancer-nerve interaction.  Methods:   We used in vitro models for NPY inhibition studies and subsequent metabolomics, apoptotic and migration assays, and nuclear transcription factor-κB (NF-κB) translocation studies. Human naïve and radiated PCa tissues were used for NPY nerve density biomarker studies. Tissues derived from a Botox denervation clinical trial were used to corroborate metabolomic changes in humans.  Results:   Cancer cells increase NPY positive nerves in vitro and in preneoplastic human tissues. NPY-specific inhibition resulted in increased cancer apoptosis, decreased motility, and energetic metabolic pathway changes. A comparison of metabolomic response in NPY-inhibited cells with the transcriptome response in human PCa patients treated with Botox showed shared 13 pathways, including the tricarboxylic acid cycle. We identified that NF-κB is a potential NPY downstream mediator. Using in vitro models and tissues derived from a previous human chemical denervation study, we show that Botox specifically, but not exclusively, inhibits NPY in cancer. Quantification of NPY nerves is independently predictive of PCa-specific death. Finally, NPY nerves might be involved in radiation therapy (RT) resistance, as radiation-induced apoptosis is reduced when PCa cells are cocultured with dorsal root ganglia/nerves and NPY positive nerves are increased in prostates of patients that failed RT.  Conclusion:   These data suggest that targeting the NPY neural microenvironment may represent a therapeutic approach for the treatment of PCa and resistance through the regulation of multiple oncogenic mechanisms.""","""['Yi Ding', 'MinJae Lee', 'Yan Gao', 'Ping Bu', 'Christian Coarfa', 'Brian Miles', 'Arun Sreekumar', 'Chad J Creighton', 'Gustavo Ayala']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Influence of the neural microenvironment on prostate cancer.', 'Activation of the Y1 receptor by neuropeptide Y regulates the growth of prostate cancer cells.', 'Alterations in neuropeptide Y, tyrosine hydroxylase, and Y-receptor subtype distribution following spinal nerve injury to rats.', 'Modulatory actions of neuropeptide Y on prostate cancer growth: role of MAP kinase/ERK 1/2 activation.', 'Relevance of the neuropeptide Y system in the biology of cancer progression.', 'Emerging role of substance and energy metabolism associated with neuroendocrine regulation in tumor cells.', 'Neuropeptide Y and its receptors in prostate cancer: associations with cancer invasiveness and perineural spread.', 'Endocrine and paracrine characteristics of neuroendocrine prostate cancer.', 'Neuroendocrine regulations in tissue-specific immunity: From mechanism to applications in tumor.', 'Targeting tumor innervation: premises, promises, and challenges.']"""

Mutually exclusive with E26 transformation-specific (ETS) rearrangements, this subtype displays high genomic instability. Previous studies indicate that deficient SPOP or CHD1 alone leads to feeble prostate abnormalities and each protein is involved in DNA damage response (DDR). It remains to be determined whether CHD1 and SPOP cooperate to suppress prostate tumorigenesis and DDR.  Methods:   Prostate-specific single or double knockout of Spop and Chd1 was generated with the Cre/loxP system in mice. Wild-type or mutant SPOP (F102C, F133V) overexpression and CHD1 knockdown with short hairpin RNA were created in human benign prostatic hyperplasia cell line BPH1. The levels of DNA damage and homologous recombination repair were measured by immunofluorescence staining of γH2AX and RAD51, respectively.  Results:   Spop/Chd1 double-knockout mice displayed prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia at both young (3 months) and old (12 months) ages and failed to generate prostate adenocarcinoma. Compared with wild-type or single-knockout mice, the double-knockout prostate harbored moderately higher proliferating cells and dramatically augmented the level of γH2AX staining, although androgen receptor-positive cells and apoptotic cells remained at a similar level. In BPH1 cell line, SPOP mutant overexpression and CHD1 silencing synergistically sensitized the cells to DNA damage by camptothecin, an inducer of double-strand breaks.  Conclusions:   Our results indicate that SPOP and CHD1 can synergistically promote repair of naturally occurring or chemically induced DNA damages in prostate epithelial cells. Regarding the progression of the SPOP/CHD1 subtype of PCa, other functionally complementary drivers warrant further identification. The clinical implication is that this subtype of PCa may be particularly sensitive to poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors or DNA-damaging agents.""","""['Yini Zhu', 'Jiling Wen', 'Gang Huang', 'Jackson Mittlesteadt', 'Xiaofei Wen', 'Xin Lu']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['CHD1 loss sensitizes prostate cancer to DNA damaging therapy by promoting error-prone double-strand break repair.', 'SPOP and CHD1 alterations in prostate cancer: Relationship with PTEN loss, tumor grade, perineural infiltration, and PSA recurrence.', 'SPOP-Mutated/CHD1-Deleted Lethal Prostate Cancer and Abiraterone Sensitivity.', 'The emerging role of speckle-type POZ protein (SPOP) in cancer development.', 'The Roles of SPOP in DNA Damage Response and DNA Replication.', 'CHD1, a multifaceted epigenetic remodeler in prostate cancer.', 'Bipolar androgen therapy plus olaparib in men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Cancer-cell-intrinsic mechanisms shaping the immunosuppressive landscape of prostate cancer.', 'Detection of disease-causing mutations in prostate cancer by NGS sequencing.', 'Genomic attributes of homology-directed DNA repair deficiency in metastatic prostate cancer.']"""

However, urine cytology interpretation is subjective and difficult. Morphogo (ALAB, Boston, MA, USA), equipped with automatic acquisition and scanning, optical focusing, and automatic classification with convolutional neural network has been developed for bone marrow aspirate smear analysis of hematopoietic diseases. The goal of this preliminary study was to determine the feasibility of developing a machine learning algorithm on Morphogo for identifying abnormal urothelial cells in urine cytology slides.  Methods:   Thirty-seven achieved abnormal urine cytology slides from cases with the diagnosis of atypical urothelial cells and above (suspicions or positive for UC) were obtained from 1 hospital. A pathologist (J.R.) reviewed the slides and manually selected and annotated representative cells to feed into Morphogo with following categories: benign (urothelial cells, squamous cells, degenerated cells, and inflammatory cells), atypical cells, and suspicious cells. Initial validation of the algorithm was performed on a subset of the original 37 cases. Urine samples from additional 12 unknown cases with various histological diagnoses (6 cases of high-grade urothelial carcinoma (HGUC), 1 case of low-grade urothelial carcinoma (LGUC), 1 case of prostate adenocarcinoma, 1 case of renal cell carcinoma, and 4 cases of non-neoplastic conditions) were collected from another hospital for initial blind testing.  Results:   A total of 1,910 benign and 1,978 abnormal (atypical and suspicious) cells from 37 slides were annotated for developing and training of the algorithm. This algorithm was validated on 27 slides that resulted in identification of at least 1 abnormal cell per slide, with a total of 200 abnormal cells, and an average of 7.4 cells per slide. Of the 12 unknown cases tested, the original cytology was positive for tumor cells in 2 HGUC samples. Morphogo was abnormal (atypical or suspicious) for 6 samples from patients with UC, including one with LGUC and one with prostate adenocarcinoma.  Conclusion:   Morphogo machine learning algorithm is capable of identifying abnormal urothelial cells. Further validation studies with a larger number of urine samples will be needed to determine if it can be used to assist the cytological diagnosis of UC.""","""['Zhihui Zhang', 'Xinyan Fu', 'Jiwei Liu', 'Zhen Huang', 'Natalia Liu', 'Fengqi Fang', 'Jianyu Rao']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Acta Cytol""","""['Causes of false-negative for high-grade urothelial carcinoma in urine cytology.', 'An institutional experience evaluating hTERT immunostaining in 100 consecutive ThinPrep urine specimens.', 'Urinary tract cytology: a cytologic-histopathologic correlation with The Paris System, an institutional study.', 'Cytologically targeted next-generation sequencing: a synergy for diagnosing urothelial carcinoma.', 'A review of urinary cytology in the setting of upper tract urothelial carcinoma.', 'Recent Application of Artificial Intelligence in Non-Gynecological Cancer Cytopathology: A Systematic Review.', 'A Calibrated Multiexit Neural Network for Detecting Urothelial Cancer Cells.']"""

Guidelines recommend BMD testing when initiating ADT to assess baseline fracture risk properly. The objective of this study was to examine the proportion of BMD testing in men initiating ADT in Quebec and to identify factors associated with receipt of this testing.  Methods:   The study cohort consisted of men extracted from Quebec public healthcare insurance administrative databases who initiated continuous ADT from 2000 to 2015 for >12 months. The primary study outcome was receipt of BMD testing in the period from 6 months before through 12 months after ADT initiation. Multivariable generalized linear mixed regression modeling with a logit link was performed to identify variables associated with BMD testing.  Results:   We identified 22,033 patients, of whom 3,910 (17.8%) underwent BMD testing. Rates of BMD testing increased from 4.1% in 2000 to 23.4% in 2015. After multivariable analyses, prior history of osteoporosis (odds ratio [OR], 1.84; 95% CI, 1.32-2.57; P<.001), rheumatoid arthritis (OR, 1.64; 95% CI, 1.15-2.34; P=.006), use of bisphosphonates (OR, 1.47; 95% CI, 1.25-1.73; P<.001), and long-term corticosteroid use (OR, 1.63; 95% CI, 1.15-2.31; P=.006) were associated with higher odds of BMD testing. Patient age >80 years (OR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.59-0.76; P<.001), metastases (OR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.70-0.89; P<.001), higher Charlson comorbidity score (OR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.51-0.81; P<.001), and rural residence (OR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.68-0.87; P<.001) were associated with lower odds of BMD testing.  Conclusions:   In our study population, BMD testing rates in men initiating ADT were low, although they increased over the years especially in the years after the publication of recommendations for BMD testing in these patients. Potential gaps identified include being older, more comorbid, and rural areas.

However, rigorous verification of detected lesions is not always performed in routine clinical practice. To aid future 18F-radiolabeled PSMA PET/CT interpretation, we aimed to identify clinical/imaging characteristics that increase the likelihood that a PSMA-avid lesion is malignant.  Materials and methods:   262 patients with BCR, who underwent 18F-DCFPyL PSMA PET/CT, were retrospectively analyzed. The malignant nature of 18F-DCFPyL PET-detected lesions was verified through any of the following metrics: (1) positive histopathological examination; (2) additional positive imaging; (3) a ≥50% decrease in Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA) following irradiation of the lesion(s).  Results:   In 226/262 PET scans (86.3%) at least one lesion suspicious for recurrent PCa was detected ('positive scan'). In 84/226 positive scans (37.2%), at least one independent verification metric was available. PSMA PET-detected lesions were most often confirmed to be malignant (PCa) in the presence of a CT-substrate (96.5% vs. 55.6% without CT-substrate), with SUVpeak ≥3.5 (91.4% vs. 60.0% with SUVpeak<3.5), in patients with a PSA-level ≥2.0 ng/mL (83.7% vs. 65.7% in patients with PSA <2.0ng/mL) and in patients with >2 PET-positive lesions (94.1% vs. 64.2% in patients with 1-2 PET-positive lesions; p<0.001-0.03).  Conclusions:   In this study, the clinical verification of 18F-DCFPyL PET-positive lesions in patients with BCR was performed.

These lesions are thought to arise from periurethral Skene's glands, the female equivalent of prostatic glands in the male. Adenoid basal carcinoma is a rare and indolent cervical neoplasm. Expression of the prostatic marker NKX3.1 in ectopic prostatic tissue and tubulosquamous polyp has been reported but no studies have examined immunoreactivity with this marker in adenoid basal carcinoma. We stained 19 cases [adenoid basal carcinoma (n=6), cervical ectopic prostatic tissue (n=11), and vaginal tubulosquamous polyp (n=3); 1 case contained both adenoid basal carcinoma and ectopic prostatic tissue] with NKX3.1. In all cases, the glandular component of these lesions exhibited diffuse nuclear immunoreactivity while normal endocervical glands were negative. Prostate-specific antigen was positive in 4 of 9 and 0 of 3 cases of ectopic prostatic tissue and tubulosquamous polyp, respectively, while PSAP was positive in 3 of 4 and 2 of 2 cases of ectopic prostatic tissue and tubulosquamous polyp respectively; 3 of 5 cases of adenoid basal carcinoma tested were focally positive with PSAP and all 5 were negative with prostate-specific antigen. While the specificity of NKX3.1 should be investigated in future studies, positivity with this marker may be useful in diagnosing these uncommon lesions. NKX3.1 appears a more sensitive marker of ectopic prostatic tissue and tubulosquamous polyp than traditional prostatic markers and positive staining provides further support that these lesions exhibit ""prostatic"" differentiation and are of Skene's gland origin.

Materials and methods:   Data concerning all men undergoing salvage radical prostatectomy for recurrent prostate cancer after either focal therapy, external beam radiation therapy or brachytherapy were retrospectively collected from 4 high volume surgical centers. The primary outcome measure of the study was toxicity of salvage radical prostatectomy characterized by any 30-day postoperative Clavien-Dindo complication rate, 12-month continence rate and 12-month potency rate. The secondary outcome was oncological outcome after salvage radical prostatectomy including positive margin rate and 12-month biochemical recurrence rate. Biochemical recurrence was estimated using Kaplan-Meier methods and significant differences were calculated using a log rank test. Median followup was 29.5 months.  Results:   Between April 2007 and September 2018, 185 patients underwent salvage radical prostatectomy of whom 95 had salvage radical prostatectomy after focal therapy and 90 had salvage radical prostatectomy after radiation therapy (external beam radiation therapy or brachytherapy). Salvage radical prostatectomy after radiation therapy was associated with a significantly higher 30-day Clavien-Dindo I-IV complication rate (34% vs 5%, p <0.001). At 12 months following surgery, patients undergoing salvage radical prostatectomy after focal therapy had significantly better continence (83% pad-free vs 49%) while potency outcomes were similar (14% vs 11%). Men undergoing salvage radical prostatectomy after radiation therapy had a significantly higher stage and grade of disease together with a higher positive surgical margin rate (37% vs 13%, p=0.001).

More recently, a transperineal (TP) approach has been made available for image guidance. Our aim was to determine if both methods produced similar alignments within the same patients.  Materials and methods:   We utilized two clinical US image guidance (IG) systems (Elekta Clarity and Best BAT). The B-mode Acquisition and Targeting USIG system is a bi-planar, so-called 2.5D USIG system, that is acquired TA. Clarity is a 3D US system that generates a volumetric 3D US data set and US-derived IG contours that are coregistered to the planning CT images. The probe is oriented in the sagittal plane against the perineum (TP). After positioning the patient for treatment using the TP USIG, we maintained the position defined by Clarity tracking and then acquired a TA-based USIG. The two US-based methods of localizing the prostate (TA vs TP) were compared via Bland-Altman (BA) statistical analysis to determine if there was alignment agreement between methods.  Results:   The BA test for all 101 patients, 2093 fractions resulted in 95% confidence intervals (upper and lower limits of the BA test) of 0.6 mm in LR, 0.9 mm in AP and 1.0 mm in SI. The bias between the two systems was calculated as 0.03, 0.02, and 0.03 mm in LR, AP, and SI.  Conclusions:   Both systems resulted in statistically equivalent targeting positions for the prostate. Because of the unique intrafraction, real-time motion tracking capability of the TP system, this solution represents a unique extension to the previously reported clinical benefits of a TA approach by providing assurance of the prostate remaining in the treatment field during beam-on.""","""['Martin Szegedi', 'Christine Boehm', 'Adam Paxton', 'Prema Rassiah-Szegedi', 'Vikren Sarkar', 'Hui Zhao', 'Frances Su', 'Kristine E Kokeny', 'Shane Lloyd', 'Jonathan Tward', 'Bill J Salter']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Comparison of 2 transabdominal ultrasound image guidance techniques for prostate and prostatic fossa radiation therapy.', 'Evaluation of transperineal ultrasound imaging as a potential solution for target tracking during hypofractionated radiotherapy for prostate cancer.', 'Determination of Intrafraction Prostate Motion During External Beam Radiation Therapy With a\xa0Transperineal 4-Dimensional Ultrasound Real-Time Tracking System.', 'Ultrasound-based stereotactic guidance in prostate cancer--quantification of organ motion and set-up errors in external beam radiation therapy.', 'Use of three-dimensional radiation therapy planning tools and intraoperative ultrasound to evaluate high dose rate prostate brachytherapy implants.']"""

This loss leads to overactive Akt signaling, which is correlated with increased metastasis and androgen independence. However, another tumor suppressor, inositol-polyphosphate 4-phosphatase type II (INPP4B), can partially compensate for the loss of PTEN. INPP4B is up-regulated by androgens, and this suggests that androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT) would lead to hyperactivity of AKT. However, in the present study, we found that in PCa, samples from men treated with ADT, ERβ, and INPP4B expression were maintained in some samples. To investigate the role of ERβ1 in regulation of INPPB, we engineered the highly metastatic PCa cell line, PC3, to express ERβ1. In these cells, INPP4B was induced by ERβ ligands, and this induction was accompanied by inhibition of Akt activity and reduction in cell migration. These findings reveal that, in the absence of androgens, ERβ1 induces INPP4B to dampen AKT signaling. Since the endogenous ERβ ligand, 3β-Adiol, is lost upon long-term ADT, to obtain the beneficial effects of ERβ1 on AKT signaling, an ERβ agonist should be added along with ADT.""","""['Surendra Chaurasiya', 'Wanfu Wu', 'Anders M Strom', 'Margaret Warner', 'Jan-Åke Gustafsson']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A""","""['Uro-Science.', 'Decreased expression and androgen regulation of the tumor suppressor gene INPP4B in prostate cancer.', 'Inositol polyphosphate 4-phosphatase type II regulation of androgen receptor activity.', 'Inositol polyphosphate 4-phosphatase II regulates PI3K/Akt signaling and is lost in human basal-like breast cancers.', 'The INPP4B paradox: Like PTEN, but different.', 'INPP4B: the new kid on the PI3K block.', 'Network Pharmacology with Experimental Investigation of the Mechanisms of Rhizoma Polygonati against Prostate Cancer with Additional Herbzymatic Activity.', 'Genistein Regulates Lipid Metabolism via Estrogen Receptor β and Its Downstream Signal Akt/mTOR in HepG2 Cells.', 'New Insights into the Activities of D-Chiro-Inositol: A Narrative Review.', 'Estrogen receptor beta signaling in CD8+ T cells boosts T cell receptor activation and antitumor immunity through a phosphotyrosine switch.']"""

WDR77 plays an essential role in prostate tumorigenesis and cell growth mediated by growth regulatory factors. Here, we identified E2F1 and E2F3 mRNAs as translational targets of WDR77. We demonstrated that WDR77 regulated the translation of E2F1 and E2F3 mRNAs through the 5' untranslated regions (UTRs) of E2F1 and E2F3 (E2F1/3) mRNAs. WDR77 physically interacted with programmed cell death 4 (PDCD4) that suppresses translation of mRNAs containing structured 5' UTRs by interacting with eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4A (eIF4A) and inhibiting its helicase activity. Further, we demonstrated that the interaction between WDR77 and PDCD4 prevented the binding of PDCD4 to eIF4A and relieved PDCD4's inhibitory effect on eIF4A1. Overall, our work reveals for the first time that WDR77 is directly involved in translational regulation of E2F1/3 mRNAs through their structured 5' UTRs, PDCD4, and eIF4A1 and provides novel insight into the cell growth controlled by WDR77.""","""['Mahmood Anber Altayyar', 'Xiumei Sheng', 'Zhengxin Wang']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Mol Cell Biol""","""['A novel mechanism for the control of translation of specific mRNAs by tumor suppressor protein Pdcd4: inhibition of translation elongation.', 'Tumor suppressor protein Pdcd4 inhibits translation of p53 mRNA.', 'Programmed cell death 4 mechanism of action: The model to be updated?', 'Eukaryotic initiation factor 4A (eIF4A) during viral infections.', 'Translational dysregulation in cancer: eIF4A isoforms and sequence determinants of eIF4A dependence.', 'Susceptibility Genes and Chromosomal Regions Associated With Non-Syndromic Familial Non-Medullary Thyroid Carcinoma: Some Pathogenetic and Diagnostic Keys.', 'Comprehensive analysis of the functional and prognostic value of E2F transcription factors in human prostate cancer through data mining and experimental validation.']"""

A Siemens CT-on-rails system was used for patient setup and target localization for intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) of prostate cancer. Fifteen previously treated prostate patients were included in this retrospective study. CT-on-Rails scans were performed before and after the IMRT treatment under local IRB approval. A total of 15 original simulation CT scans and 98 post-treatment CT scans were contoured by the same oncologist to delineate the prostate target, bladder, and rectum. IMRT plans were generated on the original simulation CTs and the same MUs and leaf sequences were used to compute the dose distributions using post-treatment CTs. Varian Velocity deformable registration was used for the summation of the fractional doses and the cumulative doses were compared with the planned doses. For the 15 patients investigated, the mean isocenter shift was up to 4.0 mm in the left-right direction, 5.9 mm in the anterior-posterior direction and 5.6 mm in the superior-inferior direction due to interfractional organ motion. The mean rectal volume varied from 0.6 to 1.73 times and the mean bladder volume varied from 0.59 to 3.65 times between simulation and the end of treatment. The prescription dose to 95% of the PTV, Dp, was set to 76 Gy for all treatment plans. The dose to 95% of the clinical treatment volume (CTV), D95, was 74.0 to 77.6 Gy and the minimum CTV dose, Dmin, was 61.0 to 71.6 Gy, respectively, in the cumulative dose distributions. Detailed analyses showed that 7.1% of the treatment fractions had cold spots (< 85% of Dp) in the peripheral CTV, leading to Dmin < 64 Gy in the cumulative dose distributions for 4 patients. The rectal dose-volume constraints were violated in 35.7% of the treatment fractions while the bladder dose was much improved in 82.7% of the treatment fractions. The current IGRT procedure for patient setup and target localization using rigid-body registration based on contour/anatomy matching is effective for population-based PTV margins. For a small group of patients, specific PTV margins and/or real-time target monitoring/tracking will be necessary due to significant prostate deformation/rotation caused by inter- and intrafractional bladder and rectal volume variation.""","""['Guoping Shan', 'Wei Hu', 'Lili Chen', 'Robert A Price', 'C-M Charlie Ma']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Med Dosim""","""['A new target localization method for image-guided radiation therapy of prostate cancer.', 'Assessment and management of interfractional variations in daily diagnostic-quality-CT guided prostate-bed irradiation after prostatectomy.', 'Probabilistic dose distribution from interfractional motion in carbon ion radiation therapy for prostate cancer shows rectum sparing with moderate target coverage degradation.', 'Pediatric radiotherapy for thoracic and abdominal targets: Organ motion, reported margin sizes, and delineation variations - A systematic review.', 'What is the Optimal Dose, Fractionation and Volume for Bladder Radiotherapy?']"""

HERO solves large general-form binary optimization problems by decomposing them into sub-problems and approximating them using a quadratic pseudo-boolean function. Optimizing the resulting function becomes a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) problem, which has been widely studied and has numerous applications in various fields. A Quantum Annealer (QA) approach has been previously investigated to solve QUBO problems, including IMRT optimization. However, the QA can only accommodate a small number of variables and requires several hours to obtain optimized plans. HERO acts as an optimizer for QUBO problems, which not only addresses these shortcomings but also relies solely on conventional hardware design while operating at room temperature. We evaluate HERO on seven prostate IMRT cases with clinical objectives, each using approximately 6000 beamlets. Our method was compared to the commercial treatment planning software, Eclipse, for both time-to-solution and plan quality. HERO solves most cases in about 30 seconds, with significantly lower objective function scores than Eclipse. The results indicate that HERO is promising for radiation therapy optimization problems.

The splice factor kinase SRPK1 drives the activity of oncogenic splice factors such as SRSF1. SRSF1 in turn promotes the expression of splice isoforms that favour tumour growth, including proangiogenic VEGF. Knockdown (with siRNA) or chemical inhibition (using SPHINX) of SRPK1 in K562 leukemia and PC3 prostate cancer cell lines reduced cell proliferation, invasion and migration. In glomerular podocytes, the Wilms tumour suppressor zinc-finger transcription factor WT1 represses SRPK1 transcription. Here we show that in cancer cells WT1 activates SRPK1 transcription, unless a canonical WT1 binding site adjacent to the transcription start site is mutated. The ability of WT1 to activate SRPK1 transcription was reversed by the transcriptional corepressor BASP1, and both WT1 and BASP1 co-precipitated with the SRPK1 promoter. BASP1 significantly increased the expression of the antiangiogenic VEGF165b splice isoform.

The MRI scanner of the Elekta Unity system has an adjusted design compared to diagnostic scanners. We investigated its impact on measuring the DWI-derived apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) regarding three aspects: the choice of b-values, the spatial variation of the ADC, and scanning during radiation treatment. The aim of this study is to give recommendations for accurate ADC measurements on Unity systems.  Materials and methods:   Signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) measurements with increasing b-values were done to determine the highest bvalue that can be measured reliably. The spatial variation of the ADC was assessed on six Unity systems with a cylindrical phantom of 40 cm diameter. The influence of gantry rotation and irradiation was investigated by acquiring DWI images before and during treatment of 11 prostate cancer patients.  Results:   On the Unity system, a maximum b-value of 500 s/mm2 should be used for ADC quantification, as a trade-off between SNR and diffusion weighting. Accurate ADC values were obtained within 7 cm from the iso-center, while outside this region ADC values deviated more than 5%. The ADC was not influenced by the rotating linac or irradiation during treatment.  Conclusion:   We provide Unity system specific recommendations for measuring the ADC.

Two readers with high (reader 1, 6 years) and low (reader 2, 2 years) level of expertise identified the lesion with the highest PI-RADS score for both version 2.0 and 2.1 for each patient. Inter-reader agreement was estimated, and diagnostic accuracy analysis was performed.  Results:   Inter-reader agreement on PI-RADS scores was fair for both version 2.0 (kappa: 0.57) and 2.1 (kappa: 0.51).

The aim of our study was to describe the presence of cribriform foci in specimens of radical prostatectomies and to evaluate whether demographic and clinical characteristics are associated with the presence of cribriform pattern.  Materials and methods:   This cohort study was based on 70 radical retropubic prostatectomies specimens collected between 2012 and 2016 and evaluated for the association of the cribriform pattern with age, prostate-specific antigen at surgery day, Gleason on biopsy, Gleason after radical prostatectomy, extracapsular extension, vesicles invasion, margins, multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging, and post-operative radiotherapy. Results; From the univariable analysis, biochemical prostatespecific antigen recurrence (p = 0.001), extracapsular extension (p = 0.003), pre-operative prostate-specific antigen (p = 0.017), vesicles invasion, (p = 0.038) and post-operative radiotherapy (p < 0.001) showed an association with the presence of cribriform pattern.

Conclusions:   In our study, the increase in preoperative prostate-specific antigen had a high association with cribriform pattern. Further evidence is needed to discriminate preoperative prostate specific antigen values that might potentially be associated with the presence of cribriform pattern.

Two readers (R1, R2) independently analyzed mpMRI, assigning a PI-RADSv2 category to each observation as appearing on each examination sequence. A study coordinator assessed final PI-RADSv2 category by combining readers' assignments according to four protocols: short MRI (sMRI) (diffusion-weighted imaging + axial T2-weighted imaging), contrast-enhanced short MRI (cesMRI) (sMRI + dynamic contrast-enhanced [DCE] imaging), biparametric MRI (diffusion-weighted imaging + multiplanar T2-weigthed imaging), and mpMRI. Using RP pathology as the reference standard for csPCa, we calculated the per-lesion cancer detection rate (CDR) and false discovery rate (FDR) for each MRI protocol (cut-off PI-RADSv2 category ≥3), and the per-PI-RADSv2 category prevalence of csPCa and false positives.  Results:   Pathology after RP found 142 csPCas with median International Society of Urogenital Pathology grade group 2, and stage ≤pT2c in 68.6% of cases.

FDR was comparable as well (14.4%-14.5% for R1 and 11.1% for R2). sMRI was the minimum protocol equaling mpMRI in terms of CDR, although cesMRI, similarly to mpMRI, was associated with fewer PI-RADSv2 category 3 assignments and higher prevalence of csPCa within PI-RADSv2 category 3 observations (66.7% versus 76.9% for R1, and 100% versus 91.7% for R2, respectively).

In this study, we aimed to investigate the function of LINC00173 on prostate cancer (PCa) and discover the potential regulatory mechanism.  Patients and methods:   RT-PCR was used to determine the levels of LINC00173, miR-338-3p and Rab25 in PCa patients and cell lines. The clinical significance of LINC00173 was statistically analyzed in 124 PCa patients. CCK-8, colony formation, transwell, scratch wound, Ethynyldeoxyuridine (EdU) assays and flow cytometry assays were used to detect the proliferation, apoptosis, invasion and migration of PCa cells. The mechanism of LINC00173 action was explored through bioinformatics, RNA pull-down assays and Luciferase reporter assays.  Results:   We observed that the expression of LINC00173 and Rab25 was distinctly upregulated in both PCa specimens and cell lines, while miR-338-3p expression was significantly down-regulated. High LINC00173 expression was associated with Gleason score, preoperative PSA level and reduced patient survivals. Functional assays revealed that knockdown of LINC00173 suppressed the proliferation, migration and invasion of PCa cells, and promoted apoptosis. Mechanistically, LINC00173 acted as a competitive endogenous RNA in PCa and increased Rab25 expressions via sponging miR-338-3p. Moreover, LINC00173 promoted PCa progression by interacting with miR-338-3p and Rab25.  Conclusions:   Our findings, for the first time, identified a novel PCa-related lncRNA, LINC00173 which might serve as an oncogene in PCa. The discovery of the LINC00173/miR-338-3p/Rab25 pathways provided new thinking for the treatments of PCa.""","""['C-H Hu', 'X-J Yang', 'L Yu', 'L-Y Wang', 'X-C Zhao', 'C-H Han']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci""","""['LncRNA HOXA11-AS promotes cell growth by sponging miR-24-3p to regulate JPT1 in prostate cancer.', 'Long non-coding TUG1 accelerates prostate cancer progression through regulating miR-128-3p/YES1 axis.', 'Long noncoding RNA SNHG14 promotes malignancy of prostate cancer by regulating with miR-5590-3p/YY1 axis.', 'A review on the role of LINC00173 in human cancers.', 'Rab25 in cancer: a brief update.', 'L-RAPiT: A Cloud-Based Computing Pipeline for the Analysis of Long-Read RNA Sequencing Data.', 'Long Intergenic Non-Protein Coding RNA 173 in Human Cancers.', 'Identification of key genes and pathway related to chemoresistance of small cell lung cancer through an integrative bioinformatics analysis.', 'Construction and Characterization of n6-Methyladenosine-Related lncRNA Prognostic Signature and Immune Cell Infiltration in Kidney Renal Clear Cell Carcinoma.', 'Underexpression of LINC00173 in TCF3/PBX1-Positive Cases Is Associated With Poor Prognosis in Children With B-Cell Precursor Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia.']"""

Thus, tissue culture approaches that more faithfully reproduce these interactions with the ECM are needed to study cancer development and progression. Many materials exist for modeling tissue environments, and the effects of differing mechanical, physical, and biochemical properties of such materials on cell behaviour are often intricately coupled and difficult to tease apart. Here, an optimized protocol was developed to generate low reaction volume disulfide-crosslinked hyaluronic acid (HA) hydrogels for use in cell culture applications to relate the properties of ECM materials to cell signalling and behaviour. Mechanically, HA hydrogels are comparable to other soft hydrogel materials such as Matrigel and agarose or to tissues lacking type I collagen and other fibrillar ECM components. The diffusion of soluble materials in these hydrogels is affected by unique mass transfer properties. Specifically, HA hydrogel concentration affects the diffusion of anionic particles above 500 kDa, whereas diffusion of smaller particles appears unimpeded by HA content, likely reflecting hydrogel pore size. The HA hydrogels have a strong exclusion effect that limits the movement of proteins into and out of the material once fully formed. Such mass transfer properties have interesting implications for cell culture, as they ultimately affect access to nutrients and the distribution of signalling molecules, affecting nutrient sensing and metabolic activity. The use of disulfide-crosslinked HA hydrogels for the culture of the model prostate cancer cell lines PC3 and LNCaP reveals correlations of protein activation linked to metabolic flux, which parallel and can thus potentially provide insights into cell survival mechanisms in response to starvation that occurs in cancer cell microenvironments.""","""['Nicky W Tam', 'Dudley Chung', 'Samuel J Baldwin', 'Jeffrey R Simmons', 'Lingling Xu', 'Jan K Rainey', 'Graham Dellaire', 'John P Frampton']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""J Mater Chem B""","""['Engineering Cellular Microenvironments with Photo- and Enzymatically Responsive Hydrogels: Toward Biomimetic 3D Cell Culture Models.', 'Hyaluronic acid-based hydrogels to study cancer cell behaviors.', 'Hyaluronic acid-fibrin interpenetrating double network hydrogel prepared in situ by orthogonal disulfide cross-linking reaction for biomedical applications.', 'Stress relaxing hyaluronic acid-collagen hydrogels promote cell spreading, fiber remodeling, and focal adhesion formation in 3D cell culture.', 'Hydrogels for in vivo-like three-dimensional cellular studies.']"""

Methods:   Candidate genes enriched in DNPC were determined using differential gene expression analysis of discovery and validation cohorts of mCRPC biopsies. Laboratory studies were carried out in human mCRPC organoid cultures, prostate cancer (PCa) cell lines, and mouse xenograft models. Epigenetic studies were carried out in a rapid autopsy cohort.  Results:   Dickkopf-1 (DKK1) expression is increased in DNPC relative to prostate-specific antigen (PSA)-expressing mCRPC in the Stand Up to Cancer/Prostate Cancer Foundation discovery cohort (11.2 v 0.28 reads per kilobase per million mapped reads; q < 0.05; n = 117) and in the University of Washington/Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center cohort (9.2 v 0.99 fragments per kilobase of transcript per million mapped reads; P < .0001). DKK1 expression can be regulated by activated Wnt signaling in vitro and correlates with activating canonical Wnt signaling mutations and low PSA mRNA in mCRPC biopsies (P < .05). DKK1 hypomethylation was associated with increased DKK1 mRNA expression (Pearson r = -0.66; P < .0001) in a rapid autopsy cohort (n = 7). DKK1-high mCRPC biopsies are infiltrated with significantly higher numbers of quiescent natural killer (NK) cells (P < .005) and lower numbers of activated NK cells (P < .0005). Growth inhibition of the human PCa model PC3 by the anti-DKK1 monoclonal antibody DKN-01 depends on the presence of NK cells in a severe combined immunodeficient xenograft mouse model.

As molecular profiles are frequently generated using bulk tissue sections, they represent an admixture of multiple cell types (including immune, stromal, and cancer cells) interacting with each other. Therefore, these molecular profiles are confounded by signals emanating from many cell types. Accurate assessment of residual cancer cell fraction is crucial for parameterization and interpretation of genomic analyses, as well as for accurately interpreting the clinical properties of the tumor.  Materials and methods:   To benchmark cancer cell fraction estimation methods, 10 estimators were applied to a clinical cohort of 333 patients with prostate cancer. These methods include gold-standard multiobserver pathology estimates, as well as estimates inferred from genome, epigenome, and transcriptome data. In addition, two methods based on genomic and transcriptomic profiles were used to quantify tumor purity in 4,497 tumors across 12 cancer types. Bulk mRNA and microRNA profiles were subject to in silico deconvolution to estimate cancer cell-specific mRNA and microRNA profiles.  Results:   We present a systematic comparison of 10 tumor purity estimation methods on a cohort of 333 prostate tumors. We quantify variation among purity estimation methods and demonstrate how this influences interpretation of clinico-genomic analyses. Our data show poor concordance between pathologic and molecular purity estimates, necessitating caution when interpreting molecular results. Limited concordance between DNA- and mRNA-derived purity estimates remained a general pan-cancer phenomenon when tested in an additional 4,497 tumors spanning 12 cancer types.  Conclusion:   The choice of tumor purity estimation method may have a profound impact on the interpretation of genomic assays. Taken together, these data highlight the need for improved assessment of tumor purity and quantitation of its influences on the molecular hallmarks of cancers.""","""['Syed Haider', 'Svitlana Tyekucheva', 'Davide Prandi', 'Natalie S Fox', 'Jaeil Ahn', 'Andrew Wei Xu', 'Angeliki Pantazi', 'Peter J Park', 'Peter W Laird', 'Chris Sander', 'Wenyi Wang', 'Francesca Demichelis', 'Massimo Loda', 'Paul C Boutros;Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""JCO Precis Oncol""","""['PUREE: accurate pan-cancer tumor purity estimation from gene expression data.', 'A reference profile-free deconvolution method to infer cancer cell-intrinsic subtypes and tumor-type-specific stromal profiles.', 'Prediction of tumor purity from gene expression data using machine learning.', 'An assessment of computational methods for estimating purity and clonality using genomic data derived from heterogeneous tumor tissue samples.', 'Cancer biology deciphered by single-cell transcriptomic sequencing.', 'PUREE: accurate pan-cancer tumor purity estimation from gene expression data.', 'Metastatic colorectal adenocarcinoma tumor purity assessment from whole exome sequencing data.', 'Tumor Purity in Preclinical Mouse Tumor Models.', 'Weakly-supervised tumor purity prediction from frozen H&E stained slides.', 'Obtaining spatially resolved tumor purity maps using deep multiple instance learning in a pan-cancer study.']"""

The disease tends to occur at an early age with a tendency to be aggressive. The objective was to determine the practice of urologists in the West African sub-region regarding treatment of localized prostate cancer, the use of nomograms and their perception of the usefulness of nomograms.  Methods:   this was a cross-sectional study that involved urologists practicing in the West African sub-region attending urology and surgery conferences of the ""Société Internationale d´Urologie"", West African college of surgeons and the Ghana association of urological surgeons. A structured questionnaire was used that sort to ascertain the treatment modalities used for localized prostate cancer and the use of nomograms in the sub-region. The study period spanned the years 2018 and 2019.  Results:   fifty-six urologists practicing in eleven West African countries responded. Fifty percent had been in practice for less than 5 years. Sixty eight percent (38/56) had been involved in the treatment of localized prostate cancer. Radical prostatectomy was widely available and the treatment modality most used 94.7% (36/38). Nomograms was used by 57.9% of them (22/38) with the Partin tables being the most commonly used nomogram (34.2%). No Locally developed nomogram for treatment of localized prostate cancer was identified.  Conclusion:   radical prostatectomy is the commonest treatment modality used for the management of localized prostate cancer in the West Africa sub-region.

The symptomatic, pathological, and immunological characteristics of EAP animals are highly consistent with human chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CP/CPPS), which makes EAP an ideal model for this disease. Here, we investigate the influence of EAP on male rat sexual function and the efficacy of anti-inflammatory therapy with celecoxib. EAP rat models were established using male Wistar rats. Rats were randomly assigned to a normal control group, an EAP model group, or an EAP model with celecoxib treatment group (celecoxib group). Behavioral changes, sexual behavioral changes, and erectile function were estimated using an open-field test, a sucrose consumption test, mating experiments, and by intracavernous pressure/mean arterial pressure ratio (ICP/MAP). Histological changes in the prostate were observed by HE staining, and the serum inflammatory factors IL-1β and TNF-α levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. In addition, serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT), 5-HT1A receptor, 5-HT2C receptor, and serotonin transporter (SERT) expression levels in the hippocampus and spinal cord (T13-L1, L5-S2) were examined by immunohistochemistry and western blot analysis. Results showed that EAP rats exhibited characteristics of depression, decreased sexual drive, premature ejaculation, and increased threshold of penile erection. Moreover, all these changes were effectively alleviated by celecoxib. Significant increases in prostatic interstitial infiltration by inflammatory cells and in serum IL-1β and TNF-α levels were observed in EAP rats, and these were partially reduced by celecoxib. Additionally, the expression pattern of serotonin system regulators in the hippocampus and spinal cord were altered in EAP model rats, including a decrease in 5-HT levels and an increase in 5-HT1A receptor levels. In conclusion, autoimmune prostatitis impaired rat sexual function, and this was effectively prevented by anti-inflammatory therapy with celecoxib. Moreover, a serotonin system disorder in the central nervous system was likely mediated via inflammation in EAP rats.""","""['Yadong Zhang', 'Xiangping Li', 'Kuikui Zhou', 'Mingkuan Zhou', 'Kai Xia', 'Yunlong Xu', 'Xiangzhou Sun', 'Yingjie Zhu', 'Chunyan Cui', 'Chunhua Deng']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Front Immunol""","""['Chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome impairs erectile function through increased endothelial dysfunction, oxidative stress, apoptosis, and corporal fibrosis in a rat model.', 'Effect of alcohol on chronic pelvic pain and prostatic inflammation in a mouse model of experimental autoimmune prostatitis.', 'Effect of tadalafil on chronic pelvic pain and prostatic inflammation in a rat model of experimental autoimmune prostatitis.', 'Experimental autoimmune prostatitis: different antigens induction and antigen-specific therapy.', 'Experimental rodent models of chronic prostatitis: effect of phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitor on chronic pelvic-pain-related behavior.', 'Glucocorticoid nanoformulations relieve chronic pelvic pain syndrome and may alleviate depression in mice.', 'Low-dose celecoxib-loaded PCL fibers reverse intervertebral disc degeneration by up-regulating CHSY3 expression.', 'Engineered Adipose-Derived Stem Cells Overexpressing RXFP1 via CRISPR Activation Ameliorate Erectile Dysfunction in Diabetic Rats.', 'The ALFF Alterations of Spontaneous Pelvic Pain in the Patients of Chronic Prostatitis/Chronic Pelvic Pain Syndrome Evaluated by fMRI.', 'Targeting Ferroptosis Attenuates Inflammation, Fibrosis, and Mast Cell Activation in Chronic Prostatitis.']"""

The role of Galectin-3 in cancer stem-like cells (CSCs) is poorly investigated. Here, we show that prostate CSCs also colonizing prostate-draining lymph nodes of transgenic adenocarcinoma of the mouse prostate (TRAMP) mice overexpress Gal-3. Gal-3 contributes to prostate CSC-mediated immune suppression because either Gal-3 silencing in CSCs, or co-culture of CSCs and T cells in the presence of the Gal-3 inhibitor N-Acetyl-D-lactosamine rescued T cell proliferation. N-Acetyl-D-lactosamine also rescued the proliferation of T cells in prostate-draining lymph nodes of TRAMP mice affected by prostate intraepithelial neoplasia. Additionally, Gal-3 impacted prostate CSC tumorigenic and metastatic potential in vivo, as Gal-3 silencing in prostate CSCs reduced both primary tumor growth and secondary invasion. Gal-3 was also found expressed in more differentiated prostate cancer cells, but with different intracellular distribution as compared to CSCs, which suggests different functions of Gal-3 in the two cell populations. In fact, the prevalent nuclear and cytoplasmic distribution of Gal-3 in prostate CSCs made them less susceptible to apoptosis, when compared to more differentiated prostate cancer cells, in which Gal-3 was predominantly intra-cytoplasmic. Finally, we found Gal-3 expressed in human and mouse prostate intraepithelial neoplasia lesions and in metastatic lymph nodes.

Olaparib led to more objective responses and longer radiographic progression-free survival than the control in cohort A and when cohorts A and B were combined. The efficacy of olaparib in cohort B was a secondary objective prespecified in the trial protocol but was not reported. Reconstructing patient-level data for cohort B, two of 54 patients (4%) in the olaparib arm and two of 24 patients (8%) in the control arm had a radiographic response, and there was no evidence that olaparib prolonged radiographic progression-free survival in cohort B (hazard ratio 0.88, 95% confidence interval 0.58-1.34). These results are in strong contrast to cohort A. PATIENT SUMMARY: A large clinical study concluded that treatment with the PARP inhibitor olaparib benefits men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer whose tumors harbor alterations in 15 different DNA repair genes.

Methods:   A dataset of planned and delivered PBS spot parameters was generated from a set of 20 prostate patient treatments. Planned spot parameters (spot position, MU and energy) were extracted from the treatment planning system (TPS) for each beam. Delivered spot parameters were extracted from irradiation log-files for each beam delivery following treatment. The dataset was used as a training dataset for three machine learning models which were trained to predict delivered spot parameters based on planned parameters. K-fold cross validation was employed for hyper-parameter tuning and model selection where the mean absolute error (MAE) was used as the model evaluation metric. The model with lowest MAE was then selected to generate a predicted dose distribution for a test prostate patient within a commercial TPS.  Results:   Analysis of the spot position delivery error between planned and delivered values resulted in standard deviations of 0.39 mm and 0.44 mm for x and y spot positions respectively. Prediction error standard deviation values of spot positions using the selected model were 0.22 mm and 0.11 mm for x and y spot positions respectively. Finally, a three-way comparison of dose distributions and DVH values for select OARs indicates that the random-forest-predicted dose distribution within the test prostate patient was in closer agreement to the delivered dose distribution than the planned distribution.

In this study, we analyzed the relationship between socio-economic deprivation and cancer mortality. We focused on lung, colon, prostate, and breast cancers in nine European urban areas over three periods: two before (2000-2003 and 2004-2008) and one after (2009-2014) the onset of the 2008 financial crisis.  Methods:   This is an ecological study of trends. The units of analysis were small areas within nine European urban areas. We used a composite deprivation index as a socio-economic indicator. As a mortality indicator, we used the smoothed standardized mortality ratio, calculated using the hierarchical Bayesian model proposed by Besag, York and Mollié. To analyze the evolution of socio-economic inequalities, we fitted an ecological regression model that included the socio-economic indicator, the period of time, and the interaction between these terms.  Results:   In men, socio-economic inequalities in all-cancer and lung cancer mortality were observed in most of the cities studied, but did not increase after the onset of the economic crisis. In women, only two cities (Stockholm and London) showed socio-economic inequalities in all-cancer and lung cancer mortality; there was also no increase in inequalities.  Conclusions:   Our results did not validate our hypothesis that inequalities increase in times of crisis. However, they emphasize the importance of socio-economic measurements for understanding mortality inequalities, and can be used to inform prevention strategies and help plan local health programs aimed at reducing health inequalities.""","""['Laia Palència', 'Josep Ferrando', ""Marc Marí-Dell'Olmo"", 'Mercè Gotsens', 'Joana Morrison', 'Dagmar Dzurova', 'Michala Lustigova', 'Claudia Costa', 'Maica Rodríguez-Sanz', 'Lucia Bosakova', 'Paula Santana', 'Carme Borrell']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Cancer Epidemiol""","""['Effect of the recent economic crisis on socioeconomic inequalities in mortality in nine urban areas in Europe.', 'Socioeconomic Inequalities in Chronic Liver Diseases and Cirrhosis Mortality in European Urban Areas before and after the Onset of the 2008 Economic Recession.', 'Socioeconomic inequalities in suicide mortality in European urban areas before and during the economic recession.', 'What do we know about the impact of economic recessions on mortality inequalities?

Methods:   We analyzed the data of 1583 patients with gastroesophageal cancer who underwent oncological resections between 2002 and 2018. Of 1583 patients, 172 had a malignant tumor before the upper gastrointestinal cancer (second primary carcinomas) and 1411 without preceding malignancies served as the control group. The analyses were performed between both groups and within the subgroup of second primary carcinomas.  Results:   Patients with second primary carcinomas were older (P < 0.0001), had more comorbidities (P < 0.0001), and underwent longer surgical resections (P = 0.0024). They had lower (y)pT-categories (P = 0.0427) and had longer stays in intensive care unit (P = 0.0002) and hospital (P = 0.0018). R0-resection was more frequent (P = 0.0275) while having more surgical complications (P = 0.0378). The median survival was 39.5 mo (primary carcinoma) versus 32.9 mo for (second primary carcinoma) and was not significantly different (P = 0.5359).In the subgroup analysis of second primaries, there were no significant survival differences depending on primary tumor entity (P = 0.4989). pT status (P = 0.0062), pN status (P < 0.0001), pM status (P < 0.0001), and R-status (P < 0.0001) were significant prognostic factors.

The implants were reconstructed and treatment plans were created with 270/65 dwell positions for the prostate/cervix phantom. Next, EMT experiments were performed in clinical BT settings using a prototype of a combined EMT/BT system. We quantified positional errors due to EM field interference from surrounding equipment by comparing planned and EMT-measured dwell positions. The mean residual error between planned and EMT-measured dwell positions was calculated in the prostate interstitial catheters and in the whole cervix implant including the applicator. For the cervix phantom, the analysis was repeated for only the interstitial catheters.  Results:   Mean residual errors of less than 0.5/0.4 mm in the prostate/cervix catheters were found. For the whole cervix implant including the applicator, large deviations up to 2.4 mm were found. Compared to the interference free set-up, the CT and patient bed environments showed larger residual errors in the interstitial catheters, but residual errors remained <1 mm in all cases.

Unfortunately, androgen-deprivation therapy and the use of even more potent AR pathway inhibitors (ARPIs) cannot bring about a cure. ARPI resistance (ie, castration-resistant PCa, CRPC) will inevitably develop. Previously, we demonstrated that GRB10 is an AR transcriptionally repressed gene that functionally contributes to CRPC development and ARPI resistance. GRB10 expression is elevated prior to CRPC development in our patient-derived xenograft models and is significantly upregulated in clinical CRPC samples. Here, we analyzed transcriptomic data from GRB10 knockdown in PCa cells and found that AR signaling is downregulated. While the mRNA expression of AR target genes decreased upon GRB10 knockdown, AR expression was not affected at the mRNA or protein level. We further found that phosphorylation of AR serine 81 (S81), which is critical for AR transcriptional activity, is decreased by GRB10 knockdown and increased by its overexpression. Luciferase assay using GRB10-knockdown cells also indicate reduced AR activity. Immunoprecipitation coupled with mass spectrometry revealed an interaction between GRB10 and the PP2A complex, which is a known phosphatase of AR. Further validations and analyses showed that GRB10 binds to the PP2Ac catalytic subunit with its PH domain. Mechanistically, GRB10 knockdown increased PP2Ac protein stability, which in turn decreased AR S81 phosphorylation and reduced AR activity. Our findings indicate a reciprocal feedback between GRB10 and AR signaling, implying the importance of GRB10 in PCa progression.""","""['Jun Hao', 'Xinpei Ci', 'Yong Wang', 'Stephen Yiu Chuen Choi', 'Sarah E Sullivan', 'Hui Xue', 'Rebecca Wu', 'Xin Dong', 'Anne M Haegert', 'Colin C Collins', 'Dong Lin', 'Yuzhuo Wang']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Int J Cancer""","""['Patient-derived Hormone-naive Prostate Cancer Xenograft Models Reveal Growth Factor Receptor Bound Protein 10 as an Androgen Receptor-repressed Gene Driving the Development of Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Proproliferative function of adaptor protein GRB10 in prostate carcinoma.', 'Estrogen induces androgen-repressed SOX4 expression to promote progression of prostate cancer cells.', 'Androgen receptor: what we know and what we expect in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Oxidative stress and androgen receptor signaling in the development and progression of castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Post-Translational Modifications That Drive Prostate Cancer Progression.']"""

Objective:   We retrospectively investigated the treatment efficacy, safety profile, and prognostic factors of enzalutamide over a relatively long observation period in Japanese patients with nmCRPC and mCRPC.  Patients and methods:   The medical records of 184 consecutive Japanese patients with nmCRPC and mCRPC who started enzalutamide treatment in our institution between January 2012 and April 2018 were reviewed. Efficacy and safety profiles were assessed and statistically analyzed.  Results:   Among these 184 patients, 44 (23.9%) nmCRPC patients, 89 (48.4%) docetaxel-naïve mCRPC patients, and 51 docetaxel-pretreated (27.7%) mCRPC patients underwent enzalutamide therapy. The median prostate-specific antigen progression-free survival (PSA-PFS) and overall survival (OS) periods for nmCRPC patients were 39.2 months and not reached; those for docetaxel-naïve mCRPC patients were 16.5 months and 59.8 months; and those for docetaxel-pretreated mCRPC patients were 7.0 months and 30.4 months, respectively. Multivariate analysis identified performance status ≥ 2, PSA > 8.89 ng/mL (median value), hemoglobin < lower limit of normal range, neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio > 3.0, and 4-week PSA decline < 50% as the predictive factors for shorter OS. Our respective prognostic models using these factors successfully demonstrated distinctly separated survival curves (p < 0.001). In addition, among these patients, 30 (16.3%) experienced adverse events and 16 (8.7%) experienced adverse events resulting in the discontinuation of therapy. Fatigue (14%) and appetite loss (7%) were the most common such events.  Conclusions:   Both the survival period and risk factors were extracted from a relatively long-term observation period.

ΔNp63 (also called p40) is a regulator of normal prostate stem/progenitor cell activities and a marker of normal basal epithelial cells. The levels of ΔNp63 are reduced in prostate adenocarcinomas, although there is also evidence that ΔNp63 is involved in CSC regulation and drives metastasis to the bone. We studied metastatic deposits of prostate cancers with isoform-specific ΔNp63 and TAp63 antibodies. We identified p63-positive cells in only 3 of 42 metastatic prostate tumors (7%), including 2/38 (5.3%) ""usual-type"" adenocarcinomas. ΔNp63 and TAp63 isoforms were present in the nuclei of a small subpopulation (< 1%) of tumor cells in these metastases. ΔNp63-positive cells showed a basal-like cell phenotype (cytokeratin 8- and androgen receptor-negative, high molecular weight cytokeratin- and cytokeratin 19-positive), distinct from the tumor bulk. TAp63-positive cells were similar but were sometimes cytokeratin 8-positive. A subset of ΔNp63-positive tumor cells were CD44-positive, a marker of ""basal"" CSCs but were not positive for the ""epithelial"" CSC marker ALDH1. TAp63 was not associated with either of these CSC markers. None of the tumors containing p63-positive cells showed evidence of bone metastasis, compared with 28% of the p63-negative tumors. These data show that both ΔNp63 and TAp63 are present in only a small proportion of prostate adenocarcinomas and do not associate with metastasis.

Favourable 12-month safety and ablation precision were previously described.  Patients and methods:   As a mandated safety criterion, TULSA was delivered as near whole-gland ablation, applying 3-mm margins sparing 10% of peripheral prostate tissue in 30 men. After 12-month biopsy and MRI, biannual follow-up included prostate-specific antigen (PSA), adverse events (AEs), and functional quality-of-life assessment, with repeat systematic biopsy at 3 years.  Results:   A 3-year follow-up was completed by 22 patients. Between 1 and 3 years, there were no new serious or severe AEs. Urinary and bowel function remained stable. Erectile function recovered by 1 year and was stable at 3 years. The PSA level decreased 95% to a median (interquartile range) nadir of 0.33 (0.1-0.4) ng/mL, stable to 0.8 (0.4-1.6) ng/mL at 3 years. Serial biopsies identified clinically significant disease in 10/29 men (34%) and any cancer in 17/29 (59%). By 3 years, seven men had recurrence (four histological, three biochemical) and had undergone salvage therapy without complications (including six prostatectomies). At 3 years, three of 22 men refused biopsy, and two of the 22 (9%) had clinically significant disease (one new, one persistent). Predictors of salvage therapy requirement included less extensive ablation coverage and higher PSA nadir.

The molecular basis of NED is not completely understood leading to a lack of effective molecular markers for its diagnosis. Here, we demonstrate for the first time, that lineage switching to NE states is accompanied by key miRNA alterations including downregulation of miR-106a~363 cluster and upregulation of miR-301a and miR-375. To systematically investigate the key miRNAs alterations driving therapy-induced NED, we performed small RNA-NGS in a retrospective cohort of human metastatic CRPC clinical samples + PDX models with adenocarcinoma features (CRPC-adeno) vs those with neuroendocrine features (CRPC-NE). Further, with the application of machine learning algorithms to sequencing data, we trained a 'miRNA classifier' that could robustly classify 'CRPC-NE' from 'CRPC-Adeno' cases. The performance of classifier was validated in an additional cohort of mCRPC patients and publicly available PCa cohorts. Importantly, we demonstrate that miR-106a~363 cluster pleiotropically regulate cardinal nodal proteins instrumental in driving NEPC including Aurora Kinase A, N-Myc, E2F1 and STAT3. Our study has important clinical implications and transformative potential as our 'miRNA classifier' can be used as a molecular tool to stratify mCRPC patients into those with/without NED and guide treatment decisions.

In the absence of a readily available reference standard for in vivo quantification, bias in PET images has been inferred using physical phantoms, even though arrangements of this sort provide only a poor approximation of the imaging environment in real patient examinations. In this study, we used data acquired from patient volunteers to assess PET quantitative bias in vivo. Image-derived radioactivity concentrations in the descending aorta were compared with blood samples counted on a calibrated γ-counter. Methods: Ten patients with prostate cancer were studied using 2-(3-(1-carboxy-5-[(6-18F-fluoro-pyridine-3-carbonyl)-amino]-pentyl)-ureido)-pentanedioic acid PET/CT. For each patient, 3 whole-body PET/CT image series were acquired after a single administration of the radiotracer: shortly after injection as well as approximately 1 and 4 h later. Venous blood samples were obtained at 8 time points over an 8-h period, and whole blood was counted on a NaI γ-counter. A 10-mm-diameter, 20-mm-long cylindric volume of interest was positioned in the descending thoracic aorta to estimate the PET-derived radioactivity concentration in blood. A triexponential function was fit to the γ-counter blood data and used to estimate the radioactivity concentration at the time of each PET acquisition. Results: The PET-derived and γ-counter-derived radioactivity concentrations were linearly related, with an R2 of 0.985, over a range of relevant radioactivity concentrations. The mean difference between the PET and γ-counter data was 4.8% ± 8.6%, with the PET measurements tending to be greater. Conclusion: Human image data acquired on a conventional whole-body PET/CT system with a typical clinical protocol differed by an average of around 5% from blood samples counted on a calibrated γ-counter. This bias may be partly attributable to residual uncorrected scatter or attenuation correction error. These data offer an opportunity for the assessment of PET bias in vivo and provide additional support for the use of quantitative imaging biomarkers.""","""['Martin A Lodge', 'Wojciech Lesniak', 'Michael A Gorin', 'Kenneth J Pienta', 'Steven P Rowe', 'Martin G Pomper']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""J Nucl Med""","""['More advantages in detecting bone and soft tissue metastases from prostate cancer using 18F-PSMA PET/CT.', 'Evaluation of in vivo quantification accuracy of the Ingenuity-TF PET/MR.', 'Scatter Correction with Combined Single-Scatter Simulation and Monte Carlo Simulation Scaling Improved the Visual Artifacts and Quantification in 3-Dimensional Brain PET/CT Imaging with 15O-Gas Inhalation.', 'Deep-JASC: joint attenuation and scatter correction in whole-body 18F-FDG PET using a deep residual network.', 'A review of harmonization strategies for quantitative PET.', 'Comparison between a dual-time-window protocol and other simplified protocols for dynamic total-body 18F-FDG PET imaging.', 'Quantitative accuracy in total-body imaging using the uEXPLORER PET/CT scanner.']"""

Limited research exists to evaluate the molecular underpinnings of immune differences in African American men (AAM) and European American men (EAM) prostate tumor microenvironment (TME).  Experimental design:   A total of 1,173 radiation-naïve radical prostatectomy samples with whole transcriptome data from the Decipher GRID registry were used. Transcriptomic expressions of 1,260 immune-specific genes were selected to assess immune-oncologic differences between AAM and EAM prostate tumors. Race-specific differential expression of genes was assessed using a rank test, and intergene correlational matrix and gene set enrichment was used for pathway analysis.  Results:   AAM prostate tumors have significant enrichment of major immune-oncologic pathways, including proinflammatory cytokines, IFNα, IFNγ, TNFα signaling, ILs, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition. AAM TME has higher total immune content score (ICSHIGH) compared with 0 (37.8% vs. 21.9%, P = 0.003). AAM tumors also have lower DNA damage repair and are genomically radiosensitive as compared with EAM. IFITM3 (IFN-inducible transmembrane protein 3) was one of the major proinflammatory genes overexpressed in AAM that predicted increased risk of biochemical recurrence selectively for AAM in both discovery [HRAAM = 2.30; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.21-4.34; P = 0.01] and validation (HRAAM = 2.42; 95% CI, 1.52-3.86; P = 0.0001) but not in EAM.  Conclusions:   Prostate tumors of AAM manifest a unique immune repertoire and have significant enrichment of proinflammatory immune pathways that are associated with poorer outcomes. Observed immune-oncologic differences can aid in a genomically adaptive approach to treating prostate cancer in AAM.""","""['Shivanshu Awasthi', 'Anders Berglund', 'Julieta Abraham-Miranda', 'Robert J Rounbehler', 'Kevin Kensler', 'Amparo Serna', 'Adriana Vidal', 'Sungyong You', 'Michael R Freeman', 'Elai Davicioni', 'Yang Liu', 'R Jeffrey Karnes', 'Eric A Klein', 'Robert B Den', 'Bruce J Trock', 'Joshua D Campbell', 'David J Einstein', 'Raavi Gupta', 'Steven Balk', 'Priti Lal', 'Jong Y Park', 'John L Cleveland', 'Timothy R Rebbeck', 'Stephen J Freedland#', 'Kosj Yamoah#']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Clin Cancer Res""","""['Comparative analysis of 1152 African-American and European-American men with prostate cancer identifies distinct genomic and immunological differences.', 'Commercial Gene Expression Tests for Prostate Cancer Prognosis Provide Paradoxical Estimates of Race-Specific Risk.', 'Validation of a genomic classifier for prediction of metastasis and prostate cancer-specific mortality in African-American men following radical prostatectomy in an equal access healthcare setting.', 'Pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines initiate multiple prostate cancer biologic pathways of cellular proliferation, heterogeneity and metastasis in a racially diverse population and underlie the genetic/biologic mechanism of racial disparity: Update.', 'Racial differences in prostate cancer treatment outcomes: a systematic review.', 'Immunologic Assessment of Tumors from a Race-matched Military Cohort Identifies Mast Cell Depletion as a Marker of Prostate Cancer Progression.', 'African American Prostate Cancer Displays Quantitatively Distinct Vitamin D Receptor Cistrome-transcriptome Relationships Regulated by BAZ1A.', 'Under-Representation of Racial Groups in Genomics Studies of Gastroenteropancreatic Neuroendocrine Neoplasms.', 'Serum Androgen Metabolites Correlate with Clinical Variables in African and European American Men with Localized, Therapy Naïve Prostate Cancer.', 'Racial differences in prostate tumor microenvironment: implications for disparate clinical outcomes and potential opportunities.']"""

One way to achieve this goal is to implement the risk-stratified pathway (RSP) using the Rotterdam Prostate Cancer Risk Calculator.  Objective:   To describe the clinical implementation of the RSP and to examine its impact on the number of PBx and the resulting changes in the PCa detection pattern compared with men undergoing PBx in a detection-focused pathway (DFP) without prior risk assessment.  Design, setting, and participants:   An institutional dataset of 505 consecutive patients with suspected PCa between July 2019 and February 2020 was used.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Chi-square test and Mann-Whitney U test were employed to examine differences in the number of PBx and the PCa detection pattern between the DFP (n = 195, 38.6%) and the RSP (n = 310, 61.4%). To minimize differences in risk stratification, inverse probability of treatment weighting was used.  Results and limitations:   After implementing the RSP, the overall biopsy rate could be reduced by 11.2% (100% vs 88.8%, p < 0.001. Additionally, compared with the DFP, the number of biopsy cores per patient was reduced in the RSP (14 [interquartile range {IQR} 14-15] vs 14 [IQR 6-14], p < 0.001) and the detection of clinically significant PCa was increased (44.3% vs 57.7%, p = 0.038). Overdiagnosis of clinically insignificant disease was decreased in the RSP (22.8% vs 12.6%, p = 0.039).  Conclusions:   Implementation of the RSP in clinical practice reduced the number of PBx and brought forth a shift in the PCa detection pattern toward clinically significant disease, while reducing overdiagnosis of clinically insignificant disease.  Patient summary:   In this study, we examined the impact of risk stratification on the number of prostate biopsies (PBx) and the consecutive detection pattern in men with suspected prostate cancer (PCa). We found that the risk-stratified pathway reduced the number of PBx while simultaneously shifting the PCa detection pattern toward clinically significant PCa.""","""['Karl H Tully', 'Henning Bahlburg', 'Sebastian Berg', 'Julian Hanske', 'Nicolas von Landenberg', 'Joachim Noldus', 'Rein-Jüri Palisaar', 'Florian Roghmann', 'Marko Brock']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Eur Urol Focus""","""['Prostate Cancer Risk Assessment in Biopsy-naïve Patients: The Rotterdam Prostate Cancer Risk Calculator in Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging-Transrectal Ultrasound (TRUS) Fusion Biopsy and Systematic TRUS Biopsy.', 'Prediction of Prostate Cancer: External Validation of the ERSPC Risk Calculator in a Contemporary Dutch Clinical Cohort.', 'What Is the Negative Predictive Value of Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging in Excluding Prostate Cancer at Biopsy?

We investigated international applications of such policies in the urologic-oncology community.  Methods:   A 20-item survey was e-mailed via SurveyMonkey to 100 international senior urologic-oncology surgeons. Leaders' policies regarding clinical/surgical management and medical education were surveyed probing demographics, affiliations, urologic-oncologic areas of interest, and current transportation restrictions. Data on COVID-19 burden were retrieved from the ECDC. Statistical analyses employed non-parametric tests (SPSS v.25.0, IBM).  Results:   Of 100 leaders from 17 countries, 63 responded to our survey, with 58 (92%) reporting university and/or cancer-center affiliations. Policies on new-patient visits remained mostly unchanged, while follow-up visits for low-risk diseases were mostly postponed, for example, 83.3% for small renal mass (SRM). Radical prostatectomy was delayed in 76.2% of cases, while maintaining scheduled timing for radical cystectomy (71.7%). Delays were longer in Europe than in the Americas for kidney cancer (SRM follow-up, P = 0.014), prostate cancer (new visits, P = 0.003), and intravesical therapy for intermediate-risk bladder cancer (P = 0.043). In Europe, COVID-19 burden correlated with policy adaptation, for example, nephrectomy delays for T2 disease (r = 0.5, P =0.005). Regarding education policies, trainees' medical education was mainly unchanged, whereas senior urologists' planned attendance at professional meetings dropped from 6 (IQR 1-11) to 2 (IQR 0-5) (P < 0.0001).  Conclusion:   Under COVID-19, senior urologic-oncology surgeons worldwide apply risk-stratified approaches to timing of clinical and surgical schedules.

Thus, we tested the association of sex with disease stage at presentation, as well as with cancer-specific mortality (CSM) after radical cystectomy (RC) in a contemporary cohort of patients with nonmetastatic urothelial bladder cancer (UCUB).  Methods:   Within the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database (2004-2016), we identified 14,086 patients (10,879 men and 3,207 women) treated with RC for non-metastatic UCUB. Temporal trend, interaction analyses, logistic regression, cumulative incidence, and competing-risks regression analyses were used.  Results:   Overall, 10,879 (77.2%) men and 3,207 (22.8%) women underwent RC between 2004 and 2016. Female gender was an independent predictor of non-organ-confined (NOC) UCUB at RC in multivariable analyses (odds ratio: 1.23; 95% confidence intervals [CI] 1.10-1.38; P < 0.001). While NOC rates in men decreased over time (from 54.8% to 45.7%; P < 0.01), NOC rates in women remained stationary (from 60.6% to 57.3%; P = 0.15) and the excess NOC rate between men and women increased from + 5.8% in 2004 to +11.6% in 2016. Moreover, in multivariable analyses adjusted for other covariates, female gender was an independent predictor of higher CSM after RC in NOC UCUB (HR: 1.14; 95%CI 1.04-1.24; P < 0.01), but not in localized UCUB (P = 0.06).  Conclusion:   It is worrisome that, while in men the rate of NOC is decreasing, NOC rates in females have not improved over time.

The quality of caregiving represents an important part of the patient's quality of life. The main objective was to describe the evolution of caregiver's attachment style during the first three years of the disease support.  Methods:   Caregivers have been included through the ICE study (Informal Carers of Elderly). They were taking care for one near parent at least 60 years of age with a diagnosis of cancer (breast, prostate, colorectal). Caregivers were interviewed at home within three months of inclusion in the ICE study. This longitudinal research based on recorded semi-structured interviews and used one scale (RSQ) to evaluate the attachment style: secure attachment, detached-type insecure, preoccupied-type insecure or fearful-type insecure.  Results:   The evolution of attachment styles reflect different relational strategies among the 33 caregivers included. The three first times of the disease are differently lived by the caregivers and are impacted by an insecurity form. The attachment style is different depending on the stage of the disease and the impact of the assistance provided shows that caregivers use more detachment relational strategy in the first year. Then, between 3 and 15 months, the attachment style is evolving towards more preoccupied style.

Study design:   Observational study.  Place and duration of study:   Urology Department, Antalya Training and Research Hospital, Turkey, between March 2015 and September 2019.  Methodology:   Four hundred and fifty-four patients underwent RARP were scanned. Clinical characteristics and pathological features of patients were recorded. Patients were excluded, if they had persistent PSA; a history of any autoimmune or inflammatory disease; anti-inflammatory agents use; blood transfusion within 3 months; or a follow-up time shorter than 3 months. Systemic inflammation markers were calculated and correlated with patients' data and biochemical recurrence (BCR). Biochemical recurrence was defined as two repetitive measurements of PSA levels ≥0.2 ng/mL at 3 months after the radical prostatectomy. Mann-Whitney U-test, Fisher's exact test, and Pearson Chi-square test, ROC curve, Kaplan-Meier survival analyses, and Cox proportional hazard regression model were used as statistical methods.  Results:   Four hundred and two patients were eligible. The median age at RP was 65.5 (61-69) years and median PSA of the patients was 8.3 (5.76-12.61) ng/ml. Median NLR, LMR, PLR, and NMR were 2 (1.55-2.61), 3.86 (3.14-5), 105.69 (85-134.29), 7.82 (6.25-9.71); and optimal cut-off values were 2.33, 3.75, 106.6, and 8.75, respectively. Low LMR was found as an important predictor of biochemical recurrence (hazard ratio, HR=1.769, 95% confidence interval, CI=1.091 - 2.868, p=0.021). A significant association was found between lower LMR and decreased BCR -free survival (p <0.001).  Conclusion:   Pretreatment low LMR might be a simple and inexpensive index, which reflects the host systemic immunity and can predict independently BCR after RARP.

Methods:   From January 2014 to January 2018, 100 men aged 50-63 years with clinical suspicion of prostate cancer (PCa) in Helsinki University Hospital underwent MRI. Nine radiologists individually reviewed the pseudonymized MRI scans of all 100 men in two ProScreen trial centers. All 100 men were biopsied according to a histological composite variable comprising radical prostatectomy histology (N = 38) or biopsy result within 1 year from the imaging (N = 62). Fleiss' kappa (κ) was used to estimate the combined agreement between all individual radiologists. Sample data were subsequently extrapolated to 1000-men subgroups of the ProScreen cohort.  Results:   Altogether 89% men of the 100-men sample were diagnosed with PCa within a median of 2.4 years of follow-up. Clinically significant PCa (csPCa) was identified in 76% men. For all PCa, mean sensitivity was 79% (SD ±10%, range 62-96%), and mean specificity 60% (SD ±22%, range 27-82%). For csPCa (Gleason Grade 2-5) MRI was equally sensitive (mean 82%, SD ±9%, range 67-97%) but less specific (mean 47%, SD ±20%, range 21-75%). Interreader agreement for any lesion was fair (κ 0.40) and for PI-RADS 4-5 lesions it was moderate (κ 0.60). Upon extrapolating these data, the average sensitivity and specificity to a screening positive subgroup of 1000 men from ProScreen with a 30% prevalence of csPCa, 639 would be biopsied. Of these, 244 men would be true positive, and 395 false positive. Moreover, 361 men would not be referred to biopsy and among these, 56 csPCas would be missed. The variation among the radiologists was broad as the least sensitive radiologist would have twice as many men biopsied and almost three times more men would undergo unnecessary biopsies. Although the most sensitive radiologist would miss only 2.6% of csPCa (false negatives), the least sensitive radiologist would miss every third.  Conclusions:   Interreader agreement was fair to moderate. The role of MRI in the ongoing ProScreen trial is crucial and has a substantial impact on the screening process.""","""['Ronja Hietikko', 'Tuomas P Kilpeläinen', 'Anu Kenttämies', 'Johanna Ronkainen', 'Kirsty Ijäs', 'Kati Lind', 'Suvi Marjasuo', 'Juha Oksala', 'Outi Oksanen', 'Tuomas Saarinen', 'Ritja Savolainen', 'Kimmo Taari', 'Teuvo L J Tammela', 'Tuomas Mirtti', 'Kari Natunen', 'Anssi Auvinen', 'Antti Rannikko']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Cancer Imaging""","""['Interreader agreement of PI-RADS v. 2 in assessing prostate cancer with multiparametric MRI: A study using whole-mount histology as the standard of reference.', 'Interreader variability in prostate MRI reporting using Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System version 2.1.', 'Analysis of PI-RADS 4 cases: Management recommendations for negatively biopsied patients.', 'Multiparametric MRI in detection and staging of prostate cancer.', 'What Is the Negative Predictive Value of Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging in Excluding Prostate Cancer at Biopsy?

While it is important to be vigilant about associated comorbidities in order to provide better patient care, data on the prevalence of comorbidities stratified by country or region are scarce. We aimed to elucidate the comorbidities associated with NTM disease based on Japanese health insurance claims data.  Methods:   Cross-sectional analyses were performed using the claims data for 2014 provided by the Japan Medical Data Center Co., Ltd. Patients aged 20-75 years with ≥3 claims associated with NTM disease were identified and matched to 10 sex-and-age-matched controls that had never made a claim for NTM disease. Thirty-one comorbidities previously suspected to be associated with NTM disease were selected, and the prevalence of these comorbidities compared between cases and controls.  Result:   Overall, 419 NTM patients (134 males and 285 females) and 4190 non-NTM controls were identified from the JMDC database. Aspergillosis, asthma, chronic heart failure, diffuse panbronchiolitis, gastroesophageal reflux, interstitial pneumonia, lung cancer, cancer other than breast, lung, ovary, or prostate cancer, and rheumatoid arthritis were associated with NTM disease in both males and females.

There has been recent interest in the use of hypofractionated radiotherapy in treating prostate cancer. However, toxicity and cancer outcomes associated with hypofractionated WPRT are unclear at this time. This phase II study aims to investigate the impact in quality of life associated with hypofractionated WPRT compared to conventionally fractionated WPRT.  Methods:   Fifty-eight patients with unfavourable intermediate-, high- or very high-risk prostate cancer will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio between high-dose-rate brachytherapy (HDR-BT) + conventionally fractionated (45 Gy in 25 fractions) WPRT vs. HDR-BT + hypofractionated (25 Gy in 5 fractions) WPRT. Randomization will be performed with a permuted block design without stratification. The primary endpoint is late bowel toxicity and the secondary endpoints include acute and late urinary and sexual toxicity, acute bowel toxicity, biochemical failure-, androgen deprivation therapy-, metastasis- and prostate cancer-free survival of the hypofractionated arm compared to the conventionally fractionated arm.  Discussion:   To our knowledge, this is the first study to compare hypofractionated WPRT to conventionally fractionated WPRT with HDR-BT boost. Hypofractionated WPRT is a more attractive and convenient treatment approach, and may become the new standard of care if demonstrated to be well-tolerated and effective.

Determinants of racial disparities are multifactorial, including socioeconomic and biologic factors.  Methods:   The authors conducted a pooled analysis of patients derived from 152 centers within the Veterans Health Administration. The cohort included men who had nonmetastatic prostate diagnosed between 2001 and 2015 and received definitive radiation therapy. The primary endpoint was prostate cancer-specific mortality (PCSM). Secondary endpoints included all-cause mortality (ACM) and the time from a prostate-specific antigen level ≥4 ng/mL to biopsy and radiation therapy. A Cox regression model was performed to adjust for differences between clinical parameters.  Results:   Among the 31,131 patients included in the cohort, 9584 (30.8%) were Black. The 10-year cumulative incidence of death from prostate cancer was lower in Black men compared with White men (4.0% vs 4.8%; P = .004). In a competing risk model, Black race was associated with a decreased risk of PCSM (subdistribution hazard ratio, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.69-0.92; P = .002). Similarly, the 10-year cumulative incidence of death from any cause was lower in Black men (27.6% vs 31.8%; P < .001). In multivariable analysis, Black men had a 10% decreased risk of ACM (hazard ratio, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.85-0.95; P < .001).  Conclusions:   The current results indicate relatively lower PCSM and ACM among Black men who were included in a large Veterans Health Administration cohort and received radiation therapy as primary treatment for nonmetastatic prostate cancer.

Methods:   We retrospectively collected data from PCa patients who underwent systematic biopsy and radical prostatectomy from January 2015 to December 2019 at Tongji Hospital of Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses were preformed to identify independent risk factors associated with upgrading, upstaging and downgrading. By incorporating selected clinical parameters with high predictive value, we constructed three nomograms to predict the probability of upgrading, upstaging and downgrading. Discrimination of nomograms was evaluated by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis with corresponding area under the curve (AUC). Decision curve analysis (DCA) and calibration curves were performed to evaluate calibration and the clinical usefulness of nomograms. Performance of the three nomograms was validated in the testing dataset.  Results:   There were 585 PCa patients in total enrolled in this study who met the inclusion criteria. Of the 585 patients, the disease of 262 (44.8 %) was upgraded and 68 (11.6 %) was downgraded, and the disease of 67 (11.5 %) was upstaged. With regard to findings of multivariable analyses, patients' age and biopsy GG (GG 2, GG 3, GG 4 versus GG 1) were significantly associated with upgrading. Moreover, maximum diameter of the index lesion (D-max), clinical T stage (cT3a, cT3b versus cT1-2), number of positive cores and total tumor length were significantly associated with upstaging. Furthermore, d-max, %fPSA (> 0.16 versus ≤ 0.16) and biopsy GG (GG 3, GG 4, GG 5 versus GG 2) were independent predictors of downgrading. The three nomograms displayed good calibration in respective calibration plots.

Although the long noncoding RNA DLX6-AS1 has been recognized to be an oncogene in multiple cancers, the biological function and regulatory mechanism of DLX6-AS1 in prostate cancer are still obscure. In the present study, we observed that DLX6-AS1 was significantly upregulated in PCa tissues and cells. Knockdown of DLX6-AS1 inhibited PCa progression by suppressing cell proliferation and accelerating cell apoptosis. Molecular mechanism exploration indicated that DLX6-AS1 acted as a sponge for miR-497-5p and synuclein gamma (SNCG) was a downstream target gene of miR-497-5p. In addition, there was a negative correlation between DLX6-AS1 and miR-497-5p in PCa tissues. Rescue assays showed that SNCG overexpression could partially recover DLX6-AS1 knockdown-mediated inhibition of progression in PCa. Furthermore, xenograft tumor model was established to determine the role of DLX6-AS1 in PCa tumor growth and the results suggested that DLX6-AS1 could facilitate tumor growth by regulating SNCG in vivo. In conclusion, our study investigated the biological function and underlying mechanism of DLX6-AS1 in PCa and validated that DLX6-AS1 functioned as an oncogene through miR-497-5p/SNCG axis.""","""['Xu Zhu', 'Xingxin Ma', 'Shuli Zhao', 'Zhigang Cao']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Environ Toxicol""","""['Long non-coding RNA DLX6-AS1 facilitates bladder cancer progression through modulating miR-195-5p/VEGFA signaling pathway.', 'DLX6-AS1/miR-204-5p/OCT1 positive feedback loop promotes tumor progression and epithelial-mesenchymal transition in gastric cancer.', 'Long Noncoding RNA DLX6-AS1 Promotes the Progression in Cervical Cancer by Targeting miR-16-5p/ARPP19 Axis.', 'DLX6-AS1 is a potential biomarker and therapeutic target in cancer initiation and progression.', 'DLX6-AS1: An Indispensable Cancer-related Long Non-coding RNA.', 'Circular RNA Dipeptidyl Peptidase 4 (circDPP4) Stimulates the Expression of Glutamate Dehydrogenase 1 to Contribute to the Malignant Phenotypes of Prostate Cancer by Sponging miR-497-5p.', 'Importance of long non-coding RNAs in the pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment of prostate cancer.', 'Expression of SPAG7 and its regulatory microRNAs in seminal plasma and seminal plasma-derived extracellular vesicles of patients with subfertility.', 'The Circular RNA Circ_0085494 Regulates Prostate Cancer Progression Through NRBP1/miR-497-5p Axis.', 'Strategies of LncRNA DLX6-AS1 on Study and Therapeutics.']"""

Materials and methods:   The study population undergoing continuous androgen deprivation therapy (agonist or antagonist) with 1-year followup was pooled for post-hoc analysis from 2 large prospective, randomized, parallel arm phase 3b trials (NCT00295750-Global; NCT00928434-USA). Survival end points were evaluated for baseline serum testosterone effect as a continuous variable and compared for low (less than 250 ng/dl) vs normal (250 ng/dl or greater) groups based on the saturation model, using Kaplan-Meier survival estimates, log rank test, and Cox proportional hazards regression models incorporating established clinically important baseline factors.  Results:   On intention to treat analysis 138 (16.5%) of 838 eligible men had baseline serum testosterone less than 250 ng/dl. Key cancer characteristics for low vs normal baseline serum testosterone cohorts were comparable; Gleason sum 7-10 (55% vs 58%), stage and prostate specific antigen 20 ng/ml or greater categories (38% each). The lowest baseline serum testosterone quartile cutoff value was 282 ng/dl or less (206 patients). Multivariable analysis showed a significant baseline serum testosterone effect for all survival end points. For the saturation model low cutoff less than 250 ng/dl, significance remained for overall (HR 2.24; p <0.02) and progression-free survival (HR 1.57; p <0.02), but not for time to prostate specific antigen progression (HR 1.37; p=0.2).  Conclusions:   Lower baseline serum testosterone was significantly associated with worse study survival end points in hormone naïve advanced prostate cancer patients undergoing continuous medical castration. Future well-designed studies should compare continuous androgen deprivation therapy (the current gold standard) with newer alternatives to optimize individualized management in these men.""","""['Anup Patel']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""J Urol""","""['Redefining clinically significant castration levels in patients with prostate cancer receiving continuous androgen deprivation therapy.', 'Testosterone Reduction of\xa0≥ 480 ng/dL Predicts Favorable Prognosis of Japanese Men With Advanced Prostate Cancer Treated With Androgen-Deprivation Therapy.', 'Clinical Outcomes and Testosterone Levels Following Continuous Androgen Deprivation in Patients with Relapsing or Locally Advanced Prostate Cancer: A Post Hoc Analysis of the ICELAND Study.', 'Serum testosterone levels after medical or surgical androgen deprivation: a comprehensive review of the literature.', 'Maximal testosterone suppression in prostate cancer--free vs total testosterone.', 'Systemic lupus erythematosus and prostate cancer risk: a pool of cohort studies and Mendelian randomization analysis.', 'Androgens, aging, and prostate health.']"""

It has been shown recently that PSMA is expressed in neovasculature of differentiated thyroid cancer. In this study, we show that 18F-DCFPyl might detect neovasculature in advanced, metastatic differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC). We first stained the preserved lymph node samples of three patients with DTC who had undergone total thyroidectomy and neck dissection for cervical lymph node metastatic disease to identify PSMA expression, with the PSMA antibody (DAKO Monoclonal). Then, we performed 18F-DCFPyl imaging in two other advanced DTC patients with elevated serum thyroglobulin (Tg), indicative of residual disease. We compared the findings with contemporaneous FDG PET/CT scan, conventional Imaging (CT,MRI) and whole-body scan performed with I123/I131. All the three lymph node samples stained positive for PSMA expression in the neovasculature. In the first imaged patient, 18F-DCFPyl detected activity within the retropharyngeal CT contrast-enhancing lymph node. Compared to FDG PET/CT, the 18F-DCFPyl scan showed a greater SUV (3.1 vs 1.8). In the second imaged patient, 18F-DCFPyl showed intense uptake in the L3 vertebra (not seen on the post treatment 131I scan or the 18F-FDG PET/CT). MRI of the lumbar spine confirmed the presence of sclerotic-lytic lesion at the location, consistent with metastatic disease.

Methods:   We performed a retrospective analysis of 1303 patients who underwent RARP during the years 2006-2019. We identified men with symptoms of andropause and low serum testosterone who received TRT post-RARP; then we divided the cohort into two groups accordingly for comparison. Biochemical recurrence (BCR) was the primary endpoint. Secondary endpoints included functional outcomes. Predictors of BCR, including the effect of TRT on BCR, were evaluated using univariable and multivariable logistic regression.  Results:   Among the forty-seven men who received TRT, the mean age was 60.83 years with a median follow-up of 48 months. Three (6.4%) and 157 (12.56%) patients experienced BCR in TRT and non-TRT groups, respectively. Baseline characteristics were similar between both groups except for higher mean BMI in the TRT group (p = 0.03).

Although some chemotherapy drugs have been reported for prostate cancer, they are not effective due to the lack of safety, efficacy and low selectivity. Hence, the novel alternative anticancer agents with remarkable effect are highly appreciable. Natural plants contain several bio-active compounds which have been traditionally used for the various medical treatments. Particularly, naringin is a natural bio-active compound commonly found in the citrus fruits, which have shown numerous biological activities. Phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) is a tumor suppressor gene, which activates both lipid phosphates and protein phosphates. The PTEN gene is negative regulator of PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathways, since, this signaling pathway play an essential role in the cell survival, proliferation and migration. In the present in silico investigation, structure based virtual screening, molecular docking, molecular dynamics simulation and Adsorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion (ADME) prediction were employed to determine the binding affinity, stability and drug likeness properties of top ranked screened compounds and naringin, respectively. The results revealed that the complex has good molecular interactions, binding stability (peak between 0.3 and 0.4 nm) and no violations in the Lipinski Rule of 5 in naringin, but the screened compounds violated the drug likeness properties.

However, PCa inevitably relapses and becomes ADT resistant. Besides androgens, there is evidence that thyroid hormone thyroxine (T4) and its active form 3,5,3'-triiodo-L-thyronine (T3) are involved in the progression of PCa. Epidemiologic evidences show a higher incidence of PCa in men with elevated thyroid hormone levels. The thyroid hormone binding protein μ-Crystallin (CRYM) mediates intracellular thyroid hormone action by sequestering T3 and blocks its binding to cognate receptors (TRα/TRβ) in target tissues. We show in our study that low CRYM expression levels in PCa patients are associated with early biochemical recurrence and poor prognosis. Moreover, we found a disease stage-specific expression of CRYM in PCa. CRYM counteracted thyroid and androgen signaling and blocked intracellular choline uptake.

Materials and methods:   A retrospective evaluation of 50 consecutive men who had previously undergone transrectal US-guided biopsy with positive results and who underwent subsequent in-bore MRI-guided biopsy at our university hospital (average time interval, 11 months) between 2012 and 2016 was performed. Ten men were excluded because of a history of treatment after transrectal US-guided biopsy. A total of 40 men (mean age, 63 years; range, 47-84 years) were included in this study. Multiparametric 3-T MRI (T2-weighted, diffusion-weighted, and dynamic contrast material-enhanced) and transrectal in-bore MRI-guided biopsy were performed. Cancer detection, disease-grade changes, and cancers missed at in-bore MRI-guided biopsy were evaluated. Descriptive statistics were used to report different rates. The Fisher exact test was used for categoric variables. The Mann-Whitney U test and independent Student t test were used for nonparametric and parametric data, respectively. The McNemar test was used for paired data.  Results:   The overall cancer detection rate when using in-bore MRI-guided biopsy was 65% (26 of 40). In-bore MRI-guided biopsy detected 14 previously undiscovered cancerous lesions (clinically significant cancers [CSCs], 57.1% [eight of 14]). An overall disease upgrade by in-bore MRI-guided biopsy occurred in 40% (16 of 40) of cases (61.5% [16 of 26] of cases with positive results from in-bore MRI-guided biopsy). One case was downgraded from a Gleason score (GS) of 3 + 4 = 7 to a GS of 3 + 3 = 6. Out of 71 sextant biopsies with positive results detected by transrectal US-guided biopsy (from all 40 patients), 80% (57 of 71) were visible on MR images (in-bore MRI-guided biopsy results were positive in 52.6% [30 of 57]), and 20% (14 of 71) had no image correlates on MR images. In-bore MRI-guided biopsy upgraded 60% (18 of 30) and downgraded 3.3% (one of 30) of detected lesions. The false-negative rate was 35% (14.2% [two of 14] of patients had CSCs; GS ≥ 7), was higher in prostate volumes of greater than 40 mL, and was lower in the anterior gland location (P = .04 and .01, respectively).  Conclusion:   Performing confirmatory in-bore MRI-guided biopsy following positive transrectal US-guided biopsy resulted in a high disease-upgrade incidence with subsequently improved disease-risk stratification, particularly when considering patients for active surveillance or focal therapy.

Published data from a few registries in SSA suggest that the rates are still rising, but there is little comprehensive information on the time trends of prostate cancer incidence.  Methods:   We analyzed registry data on 13,170 incident prostate cancer cases in men aged 40 years or above, from 12 population-based cancer registries in 11 SSA countries, with at least a 10-year time span of comparable data.  Results:   We observed an increase in cumulative risks (CR) and age-standardized incidence rates (ASR) over time in all registries (statistically significant in all but one). The highest values of CR were found in Seychelles and Harare (Zimbabwe). The highest annual increase in the ASRs was seen in Seychelles and Eastern Cape (South Africa), whereas the lowest was seen in Mauritius. We mainly found a steady increase in incidence with age and during successive periods.  Conclusions:   This analysis reveals that prostate cancer incidence rates are rising in many populations in SSA-often very rapidly-which is in contrast to recent observations worldwide. We acknowledge that the reasons are multifactorial and largely remain unclear, but believe that they are primarily associated with improvements in health care systems, for example, a broader use of prostate-specific antigen testing.

To identify candidate therapeutic gene targets, we applied a murine prostate cancer orthograft model that recapitulates clinical invasive prostate cancer in a genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 screen under docetaxel treatment pressure. We identified 17 candidate genes whose suppression may enhance the efficacy of docetaxel, with transcription elongation factor A-like 1 (Tceal1) as the top candidate. TCEAL1 function is not fully characterised; it may modulate transcription in a promoter dependent fashion. Suppressed TCEAL1 expression in multiple human prostate cancer cell lines enhanced therapeutic response to docetaxel. Based on gene set enrichment analysis from transcriptomic data and flow cytometry, we confirmed that loss of TCEAL1 in combination with docetaxel leads to an altered cell cycle profile compared with docetaxel alone, with increased subG1 cell death and increased polyploidy.

In addition, the shared and distinct microbiome features among complex human diseases remain largely unclear.  Results:   This analysis was based on a Chinese population with 1475 participants. We estimated the SNP-based heritability, which suggested that Desulfovibrionaceae and Odoribacter had significant heritability estimates (0.456 and 0.476, respectively). We performed a microbiome genome-wide association study to identify host genetic variants associated with the gut microbiome. We then conducted bidirectional Mendelian randomization analyses to examine the potential causal associations between the gut microbiome and complex human diseases. We found that Saccharibacteria could potentially decrease the concentration of serum creatinine and increase the estimated glomerular filtration rate. On the other hand, atrial fibrillation, chronic kidney disease and prostate cancer, as predicted by host genetics, had potential causal effects on the abundance of some specific gut microbiota. For example, atrial fibrillation increased the abundance of Burkholderiales and Alcaligenaceae and decreased the abundance of Lachnobacterium, Bacteroides coprophilus, Barnesiellaceae, an undefined genus in the family Veillonellaceae and Mitsuokella. Further disease-microbiome feature analysis suggested that systemic lupus erythematosus and chronic myeloid leukaemia shared common gut microbiome features.  Conclusions:   These results suggest that different complex human diseases share common and distinct gut microbiome features, which may help reshape our understanding of disease aetiology in humans.

Herein we report the synergistic antitumor interaction between two well-known drugs used for years in clinical practice, the antiepileptic agent with histone deacetylase inhibitory activity valproic acid and the cholesterol lowering agent simvastatin, in mCRPC models.  Methods:   Synergistic anti-tumor effect was assessed on PC3, 22Rv1, DU145, DU145R80, LNCaP prostate cancer cell lines and EPN normal prostate epithelial cells, by calculating combination index (CI), caspase 3/7 activation and colony formation assays as well as on tumor spheroids and microtissues scored with luminescence 3D-cell viability assay. Cancer stem cells (CSC) compartment was studied evaluating specific markers by RT-PCR, western blotting and flow cytometry as well as by limiting dilution assay. Cholesterol content was evaluated by 1H-NMR. Overexpression of wild-type YAP and constitutively active YAP5SA were obtained by lipofectamine-based transfection and evaluated by immunofluorescence, western blotting and RT-PCR. 22Rv1 R_39 docetaxel resistant cells were selected by stepwise exposure to increasing drug concentrations. In vivo experiments were performed on xenograft models of DU145R80, 22Rv1 parental and docetaxel resistant cells, in athymic mice.  Results:   We demonstrated the capacity of the combined approach to target CSC compartment by a novel molecular mechanism based on the inhibition of YAP oncogene via concurrent modulation of mevalonate pathway and AMPK. Because both CSCs and YAP activation have been associated with chemo-resistance, we tested if the combined approach can potentiate docetaxel, a standard of care in mCRCP treatment. Indeed, we demonstrated, both in vitro and in vivo models, the ability of valproic acid/simvastatin combination to sensitize mCRPC cells to docetaxel and to revert docetaxel-resistance, by mevalonate pathway/YAP axis modulation.  Conclusion:   Overall, mCRPC progression and therapeutic resistance driven by CSCs via YAP, can be tackled by the combined repurposing of two generic and safe drugs, an approach that warrants further clinical development in this disease.""","""['Federica Iannelli', 'Maria Serena Roca', 'Rita Lombardi', 'Chiara Ciardiello', 'Laura Grumetti', 'Simona De Rienzo', 'Tania Moccia', 'Carlo Vitagliano', 'Angela Sorice', 'Susan Costantini', 'Maria Rita Milone', 'Biagio Pucci', 'Alessandra Leone', 'Elena Di Gennaro', 'Rita Mancini', 'Gennaro Ciliberto', 'Francesca Bruzzese', 'Alfredo Budillon']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""J Exp Clin Cancer Res""","""['Combined targeting of EGFR and HER2 against prostate cancer stem cells.', 'miR-375 induces docetaxel resistance in prostate cancer by targeting SEC23A and YAP1.', 'Anti-cancer efficacy of SREBP inhibitor, alone or in combination with docetaxel, in prostate cancer harboring p53 mutations.', 'Identification, characterization, and biological relevance of prostate cancer stem cells from clinical specimens.', 'Prostate cancer stem cell biology.', 'New insights into lipid metabolism and prostate cancer (Review).', 'Synergistic antitumor activity of regorafenib and rosuvastatin in colorectal cancer.', ""Let's Go 3D!

Methods:   This prospective phase I/IIa study was conducted between 2016 and 2017. Following WPRT of 44 Gy in 20 fractions, patients were randomized to two boost doses, 18 Gy and 21 Gy, in 3 fractions using the Cyberknife system. Primary endpoints were incidences of acute toxicities and short-term biochemical recurrence-free survival (BCRFS). Secondary endpoints included late toxicities and short-term clinical progression-free survival (CPFS).  Results:   A total of 26 patients were enrolled. Twelve patients received a boost dose of 18 Gy, and the rest received 21 Gy. The Median follow-up duration was 35 months. There were no grade ≥ 3 genitourinary (GU) or gastrointestinal (GI) toxicities. Sixty-one and 4% of patients experienced grade 1-2 acute GU and GI toxicities, respectively.

Tissue specimens based single-cell RNA sequencing holds great promise for identification of novel biomarkers. However, this technique has yet been used in the study of prostate cancer heterogeneity.  Methods:   Cell types and the corresponding marker genes were identified by single-cell RNA sequencing. Malignant states of different clusters were evaluated by copy number variation analysis and differentially expressed genes of pseudo-bulks sequencing. Diagnosis and stratification of prostate cancer was estimated by receiver operating characteristic curves of marker genes. Expression characteristics of marker genes were verified by immunostaining.  Results:   Fifteen cell groups including three luminal clusters with different expression profiles were identified in prostate cancer tissues. The luminal cluster with the highest copy number variation level and marker genes enriched in prostate cancer-related metabolic processes was considered the malignant cluster. This cluster contained a distinct subgroup with high expression level of prostate cancer biomarkers and a strong distinguishing ability of normal and cancerous prostates across different pathology grading. In addition, we identified another marker gene, Hepsin (HPN), with a 0.930 area under the curve score distinguishing normal tissue from prostate cancer lesion.

Herein, a photothermally responsive poly (methyl methacrylate) (PMMA)/paper hybrid disk (PT-Disk) was developed as a novel photothermal immunoassay device with the integration of a clip-magazine-assembled photothermal biosensing strategy. The PT-Disk consisted of a dissociative thermoresponsive hydrogel-loaded clip unit where the sandwich-type immunoreaction with an iron oxide-to-Prussian blue nanoparticle (PB NP) conversion took place and a magazine bearer for the rotational clip assembly and visual signal outputs. Upon laser irradiation of the clip-magazine-assembled PT-Disk, on-chip photothermal effect of PB NPs triggered both dose-dependent temperature elevation and the subsequent release of dye solutions from the central clip unit to surrounding magazine-bearing paper channels as the result of phase transition of the hydrogels, realizing multiplexed thermal image- and distance-based visual quantitative signal outputs in combination with the preliminary colorimetric readout on the PT-Disk.

The molecular mechanisms underlying PCa metastasis are complex and remain unclear. Here, we examine the role of a new member of the fatty acid-binding protein (FABP) family, FABP12, in PCa progression. FABP12 is preferentially amplified and/or overexpressed in metastatic compared to primary tumors from both PCa patients and xenograft animal models. We show that FABP12 concurrently triggers metastatic phenotypes (induced epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) leading to increased cell motility and invasion) and lipid bioenergetics (increased fatty acid uptake and accumulation, increased ATP production from fatty acid β-oxidation) in PCa cells, supporting increased reliance on fatty acids for energy production. Mechanistically, we show that FABP12 is a driver of PPARγ activation which, in turn, regulates FABP12's role in lipid metabolism and PCa progression. Our results point to a novel role for a FABP-PPAR pathway in promoting PCa metastasis through induction of EMT and lipid bioenergetics.""","""['Rong-Zong Liu', 'Won-Shik Choi', 'Saket Jain', 'Deepak Dinakaran', 'Xia Xu', 'Woo Hyun Han', 'Xiao-Hong Yang', 'Darryl D Glubrecht', 'Ronald B Moore', 'Hélène Lemieux', 'Roseline Godbout']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Mol Oncol""","""['Oncogenic miR-210-3p promotes prostate cancer cell EMT and bone metastasis via NF-κB signaling pathway.', 'Targeting the SPOCK1-snail/slug axis-mediated epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition by apigenin contributes to repression of prostate cancer metastasis.', 'Secreted Hsp90 is a novel regulator of the epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) in prostate cancer.', 'MicroRNAs and epithelial-mesenchymal transition in prostate cancer.', 'An Amplified Fatty Acid-Binding Protein Gene Cluster in Prostate Cancer: Emerging Roles in Lipid Metabolism and Metastasis.', 'New insights into lipid metabolism and prostate cancer (Review).', 'Mechanisms of Prostate Cancer Cells Survival and Their Therapeutic Targeting.', 'Advances in the Diagnosis and Treatment of Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease.', 'A Novel Four Mitochondrial Respiration-Related Signature for Predicting Biochemical Recurrence of Prostate Cancer.', 'Emerging Hallmarks of Metabolic Reprogramming in Prostate Cancer.']"""

Effective responses from health care and social services depend on appropriate identification of survivors and their families´ specific needs. There are few studies on survivorship in low and middle-income countries, therefore, more evidence-based studies are necessary to develop a comprehensive approach to cancer survivorship.  Objectives:   Identify the needs of cancer survivors and their relatives, specifically those of individuals with breast, cervical or prostate cancer, and with acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL).  Methods:   A qualitative, exploratory study conducted in two referral institutions in Brazil, located in Rio de Janeiro (Southeast region) and Fortaleza (Northeast region). The study included 47 patients of public and private health services and 12 family members. We used script-based semi-structured interviews. The discursive material obtained was categorized and analyzed using the Thematic Analysis approach.  Results:   The analysis identified three central themes: 1) consequences of cancer treatment; 2) Changes in daily life associated with cancer survivorship; and 3) Unmet structural needs in cancer survivorship.  Conclusion:   Social and cancer control policies in Brazil should provide resources, specific care standards and clinical, psychological and social support. Cancer survivors should also receive rehabilitation and work reintegration guidelines. This matter requires broader access to qualified cancer information, development of an integrated patient-centered care and care model, and more research resources for the country's post-treatment cancer period.""","""['Antonio Tadeu Cheriff Dos Santos', 'Rildo Pereira da Silva', 'Liz Maria de Almeida', 'Maria Lúcia Magalhães Bosi', 'Maria de Fátima Batalha de Menezes', 'Marcia Marília Vargas Fróes Skaba', 'Gustavo Nigenda', 'Carlos André Moura Arruda', 'Cleoneide Paulo Oliveira Pinheiro', 'María Cecilia González-Robledo', 'Felícia Marie Knaul']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Quality of life, coping strategies, and supportive care needs in head and neck cancer survivors: a qualitative study.', 'Shifting Needs and Preferences: Supporting Young Adult Cancer Patients During the Transition from Active Treatment to Survivorship Care.', 'Unmet needs of family cancer caregivers predict quality of life in long-term cancer survivorship.', 'Head and Neck Cancer Survivorship Care: A Review of the Current Guidelines and Remaining Unmet Needs.', ""Family Caregivers' Unmet Needs in Long-term Cancer Survivorship."", 'Breast cancer patient experiences through a journey map: A qualitative study.', 'Perspectives of Esophageal Cancer Survivors on Diagnosis, Treatment, and Recovery.']"""

Diagnoses:   Due to the results from imaging and pathological examinations, a diagnosis of PC with multiple bone metastases accompanied by primary hepatocellular carcinoma was made.  Interventions:   Taking into consideration the patient's age, interventional therapy was performed for the liver lesion, whereas the prostate and bone lesions were treated with endocrine therapy.  Outcomes:   The patient recovered well and was discharged uneventfully postoperatively. The patient was also doing well at the 6-month follow-up.

Common barriers to the implementation of telemedicine included a lack of technological literacy, concerns with reimbursement, and resistance to changes in the workplace. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic declared in March 2020, the delivery of urological services globally has quickly shifted to telemedicine to account for the mass clinical, procedural, and operative cancellations, inadequate personal protective equipment, and shortage of personnel.  Objective:   The aim of this study was to investigate current telemedicine usage by urologists, urologists' perceptions on the necessity of in-person clinic appointments, the usability of telemedicine, and the current barriers to its implementation.  Methods:   We conducted a global, cross-sectional, web-based survey to investigate the use of telemedicine before and after the COVID-19 pandemic. Urologists' perceived usability of telemedicine was assessed using a modified Delphi approach to create questions based on a modified version of the validated Telehealth Usability Questionnaire (TUQ). For the purposes of this study, telemedicine was defined as video calls only.  Results:   A total of 620 urologists from 58 different countries and 6 continents participated in the survey. Prior to COVID-19, 15.8% (n=98) of urologists surveyed were using telemedicine in their clinical practices; during the pandemic, that proportion increased to 46.1% (n=283). Of the urologists without telemedicine experience, interest in telemedicine usage increased from 43.7% (n=139) to 80.8% (n=257) during the COVID-19 pandemic. Among urologists that used telemedicine during the pandemic, 80.9% (n=244) were interested in continuing to use it in their practice. The three most commonly used platforms were Zoom, Doxy.me, and Epic, and the top three barriers to implementing telemedicine were patients' lack of technological comprehension, patients' lack of access to the required technology, and reimbursement concerns.  Conclusions:   This is the first study to quantify the use, usability, and pervading interest in telemedicine among urologists during the COVID-19 pandemic. In the face of this pandemic, urologists' usage of telemedicine nearly tripled, demonstrating their ability to adopt and adapt telemedicine into their practices, but barriers involving the technology itself are still preventing many from utilizing it despite increasing interest.""","""['Justin M Dubin', 'W Austin Wyant', 'Navin C Balaji', 'William Lk Ong', 'Reda H Kettache', 'Malik Haffaf', 'Skander Zouari', 'Diego Santillan', 'Ana Maria Autrán Gómez', 'Hossein Sadeghi-Nejad', 'Stacy Loeb', 'James F Borin', 'Juan Gomez Rivas', 'Jeremy Grummet', 'Ranjith Ramasamy', 'Jeremy Y C Teoh']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""J Med Internet Res""","""['A Global Survey on the Impact of COVID-19 on Urological Services.', 'The Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Urology Practice in Indonesia: A Nationwide Survey.', 'A survey and panel discussion of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on paediatric urological productivity, guideline adherence and provider stress.', 'Usability of Telehealth Systems for Noncommunicable Diseases in Primary Care From the COVID-19 Pandemic Onward: Systematic Review.', 'Telemedicine for HIV Care: Current Status and Future Prospects.', 'Self-removal of catheter after robot-assisted radical prostatectomy: a feasibility study.', 'Characteristics of direct-to-consumer platforms offering erectile dysfunction treatment.', 'Study design of a phase 4, real-world study (COMPOSUR) to evaluate vibegron in patients with overactive bladder.', 'Telehealth Readiness of Healthcare Providers during COVID-19 Pandemic in Saudi Arabia.', ""Physicians' views on optimal use and payment system for telemedicine: a qualitative study.""]"""

We have investigated if the radiotherapy planning process and plan quality can be improved using a well-tuned model developed through a commercial system for knowledge-based planning (KBP).  Material and methods:   Treatment plans from 69 patients treated for high-risk prostate cancer with manually planned VMAT were used to develop an initial KBP model (RapidPlan, RP). Prescribed doses were 50, 60, 67.5, and 72.5 Gy in 25 fractions to the pelvic lymph nodes, prostate and seminal vesicles, prostate gland, and prostate tumour(s), respectively. This RP model was in clinical use from July 2019 to February 2020, producing another set of 69 clinically delivered treatment plans for a new patient group, which were used to develop a second RP model. Both models were validated on an independent group of 40 patients. Plan quality was compared by D 98% and the Paddick conformity index for targets, mean dose (D mean) and generalised equivalent uniform dose (gEUD) for bladder, bowel bag and rectum, and number of monitor units (MU).  Results:   Target coverage and conformity was similar between manually created and RP treatment plans. Compared to the manually created treatment plans, the final RP model reduced average D mean and gEUD with 2.7 Gy and 1.3 Gy for bladder, 1.2 Gy and 0.9 Gy for bowel bag, and 2.7 Gy and 0.8 Gy for rectum, respectively (p < .05). For rectum, the interpatient variation (i.e., 95% confidence interval) of DVHs was reduced by 23%.

In 2013 and 2014, these oral agents were approved for use in men with metastatic prostate cancer who had minimal to no symptoms. We compared overall survival (OS) in men who received their first mCRPC treatment using the Medicare Fee-for-Service 100% administrative claims research dataset with patient-level linkage to the National Death Index.  Methods:   This retrospective cohort analysis (January 2013 to December 2017) included men who were chemo-naïve at treatment start in 2014 and who had continuous Medicare Parts A, B, and D eligibility during the 3-year observation period. We compared: first-line sipuleucel-T vs. first-line ASPIs and any-line sipuleucel-T vs. any-line ASPIs (without sipuleucel-T). We used a multivariable regression model to help control for potentially confounding factors while assessing survival outcomes.  Results:   The model included 6044 eligible men (average age 75-78 years) with similar disease severity; > 80% were white. Median OS, presented as sipuleucel-T vs. ASPI, was 35.2 vs. 20.7 months (n, 906 vs. 5092; any-line cohort) and 34.9 vs. 21.0 months (n, 647 vs. 4810; first-line cohort). Model outcomes indicated sipuleucel-T was associated with significantly prolonged OS compared with ASPIs: adjusted hazard ratio, 0.59 (95% CI 0.527-0.651) and 0.56 (0.494-0.627) for the any-line and first-line cohorts, respectively.

Materials and methods:   From 2013 to 2015, the first 40 prostate cancer patients that were scheduled for proton therapy underwent transrectal fiducial marker placement, and the next 40 patients underwent transperineal fiducial marker placement (the first series). Technical and clinical success and pain scores were evaluated. In the second series (n = 280), the transrectal or transperineal approach was selected depending on the presence/absence of comorbidities, such as blood coagulation abnormalities. Seven patients refused to undergo the procedure. Thus, the total number of patients across both series was 353 (262 and 91 underwent the transrectal and transperineal approach, respectively). Technical and clinical success, complications, marker migration and the distance between the two markers were evaluated.  Results:   In the first series, the technical and clinical success rates were 100% in both groups. The transrectal group exhibited lower pain scores than the transperineal group. The overall technical success rates of the transrectal and transperineal groups were 100% (262/262) and 99% (90/91), respectively (P > 0.05). The overall clinical success rate was 100% in both groups, and there were no major complications in either group. The migration rates of the two groups did not differ significantly. The mean distance between the two markers was 25.6 ± 7.1 mm (mean ± standard deviation) in the transrectal group and 31.9 ± 5.2 mm in the transperineal group (P < 0.05).

Using the typical androgen deprivation therapy, most tumors will progress to CRPC, as well as develop into neuroendocrine prostate cancer (NEPC) characterized by the expression of neuroendocrine markers such as enolase 2 (NSE). Our study was aimed at investigating the expressions of PSCA and NSE and the relationship between the two markers, as well as the correlation between the PSCA and NSE expressions and the clinicopathological parameters in prostate cancer specimens from 118 patients by using immunohistochemistry. Our results demonstrated that the PSCA and NSE protein expressions did not correlate with the prostate cancer patients' age or the hormone therapy but showed a significant correlation with the pathological tumor stage of prostate cancer, the Gleason score, and the presence of metastasis. There is a positive association between PSCA and NSE but a negative one between the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and PSCA or between PSA and NSE. High PSCA and NSE expressions correlated with a poor prognosis in prostate cancer patients.

In this work, we identified 681 eRNAs and 292 SE-lncRNAs that were expressed differentially in PCa using a microarray. We also found that eRNAs transcribed from active open chromatin had significantly higher expression than those from active closed chromatin, and SE-lncRNAs had a little higher expression than eRNAs. Next, we constructed a transcriptional regulation network that eRNA-related enhancer and the target genes shared the same TF-binding motifs. Further, we investigated whether CTCF played a role in mediating the transcriptional regulation network. eRNAs, especially those that regulate androgen response genes, may be candidates for prognostic biomarkers and therapy targets.

The aim of the present study was to investigate the anticancer activity of linalool using the human prostate cancer 22Rv1 cell line. Flow cytometry was employed to study the effects of linalool on the induction of apoptosis, cell cycle progression, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and cytochrome c release, whereas the effects of linalool on apoptosis-associated proteins were investigated by western blot analysis. An efficacy study was conducted using 22Rv1 tumor-bearing mice. The expression of the cell proliferation markers Ki-67 and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) in xenograft tumors was evaluated by immunohistochemistry. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay was used to study the induction of apoptosis in an in vivo model. Linalool exerted an inhibitory effect on 22Rv1 cell proliferation and induced apoptosis in both in vitro and in vivo models. Western blot analysis indicated that both the mitochondria-mediated intrinsic and death-receptor-mediated extrinsic pathways were involved in the induction of apoptosis. Furthermore, linalool significantly reduced the expression of Ki-67 and PCNA in the 22Rv1 ×enograft model.

Design:   Population based, prospective cohort study with follow-up over 15 years.  Setting:   New South Wales, Australia.  Participants:   1642 men with localised prostate cancer, aged less than 70, and 786 controls randomly recruited from the New South Wales electoral roll into the New South Wales Prostate Cancer Care and Outcomes Study (PCOS).  Main outcome measures:   General health and disease specific quality of life were self-reported at seven time points over a 15 year period, using the 12-item Short Form Health Survey scale, University of California, Los Angeles prostate cancer index, and expanded prostate cancer index composite short form (EPIC-26). Adjusted mean differences were calculated with controls as the comparison group. Clinical significance of adjusted mean differences was assessed by the minimally important difference, defined as one third of the standard deviation (SD) from the baseline score.  Results:   At 15 years, all treatment groups reported high levels of erectile dysfunction, depending on treatment (62.3% (active surveillance/watchful waiting, n=33/53) to 83.0% (non-nerve sparing radical prostatectomy, n=117/141)) compared with controls (42.7% (n=44/103)).

Using median 10-year data from the largest randomised controlled trial to date (ProtecT), the lifetime cost-effectiveness of three major treatments (radical radiotherapy, radical prostatectomy and active monitoring) was explored according to age and risk subgroups.  Methods:   A decision-analytic (Markov) model was developed and informed by clinical input. The economic evaluation adopted a UK NHS perspective and the outcome was cost per Quality-Adjusted Life Year (QALY) gained (reported in UK£), estimated using EQ-5D-3L.  Results:   Costs and QALYs extrapolated over the lifetime were mostly similar between the three randomised strategies and their subgroups, but with some important differences. Across all analyses, active monitoring was associated with higher costs, probably associated with higher rates of metastatic disease and changes to radical treatments. When comparing the value of the strategies (QALY gains and costs) in monetary terms, for both low-risk prostate cancer subgroups, radiotherapy generated the greatest net monetary benefit (£293,446 [95% CI £282,811 to £299,451] by D'Amico and £292,736 [95% CI £284,074 to £297,719] by Grade group 1). However, the sensitivity analysis highlighted uncertainty in the finding when stratified by Grade group, as radiotherapy had 53% probability of cost-effectiveness and prostatectomy had 43%. In intermediate/high risk groups, using D'Amico and Grade group > = 2, prostatectomy generated the greatest net monetary benefit (£275,977 [95% CI £258,630 to £285,474] by D'Amico and £271,933 [95% CI £237,864 to £287,784] by Grade group). This finding was supported by the sensitivity analysis. Prostatectomy had the greatest net benefit (£290,487 [95% CI £280,781 to £296,281]) for men younger than 65 and radical radiotherapy (£201,311 [95% CI £195,161 to £205,049]) for men older than 65, but sensitivity analysis showed considerable uncertainty in both findings.  Conclusion:   Over the lifetime, extrapolating from the ProtecT trial, radical radiotherapy and prostatectomy appeared to be cost-effective for low risk prostate cancer, and radical prostatectomy for intermediate/high risk prostate cancer, but there was uncertainty in some estimates.

Maternal malnutrition (MM) has also been associated with prostate carcinogenesis. However, the molecular mechanisms associated with this condition remain poorly understood. Using a proteomic analysis, we demonstrated that MM changed the levels of proteins associated with growth factors, estrogen signaling, detoxification, and energy metabolism in the prostate of both young and old rats. These animals also showed increased levels of molecular markers of endoplasmic reticulum function and histones. We further performed an in silico analysis that identified commonly deregulated proteins in the ventral prostate of old rats submitted to MM with a mouse model and patients with prostate cancer. In conclusion, our results demonstrated that estrogenic signaling pathways, endoplasmic reticulum functions, energy metabolism, and molecular sensors of protein folding and Ca2+ homeostasis, besides histone, and RAS-GTPase family appear to be involved in this process.

In this study, patients undergoing prostatectomy were randomized to receive either a 16 French or 20 French catheter to assess the impact of catheter size on postoperative continence and pain.  Materials and methods:   Patients were prospectively randomized to receive either a 16 French or a 20 French latex catheter at the completion of prostatectomy. Subjects were asked on postoperative day 7 to report their average catheter-related pain and the amount of opioid medication used. International Prostate Symptom Score, Quality of Life score and pads per day were recorded 6 and 12 weeks postoperatively.  Results:   Fifty-two patients were randomized. Seven were excluded: surgeon catheter preference (3) or withdrawal of consent (4). Demographic and pathologic data did not differ between groups (all p > 0.20). Catheter pain scores and postoperative opioid use were not different between groups (all p > 0.78). Postoperative subjective urinary symptom scores, and pads per day did not differ between groups at both 6 and 12 weeks (all p > 0.16).  Conclusions:   Catheter size did not impact postoperative urethral and bladder pain or continence prostatectomy.

Methods:   The participants in the screening arm of the Finnish trial (31,867 men) were classified according to screening attendance in a time-dependent fashion. Initially, all men in the screening arm were regarded as nonattenders until the first screening attendance; they then remained in the once-screened group until the second screen and similarly for the possible third round. The control arm formed the reference group. Follow-up started at randomization and ended at the time of diagnosis of PC, emigration, or the end of 2015. PC cases were divided into risk groups according to European Association of Urology definitions.  Results:   The incidence of low-risk PC increased with the number of screens, whereas no clear relation with participation was noted in the intermediate-risk and high-risk cases. For patients with advanced PC, attending screening at least twice was associated with a lower risk.  Conclusions:   Screening reduces the risk of advanced PC after only 2 screening cycles.

This study aims to demonstrate the utility of research reactors to produce clinical-grade 64Cu via 63Cu(n,γ)64Cu reaction and use it in the form of [64Cu]CuCl2 as a radiopharmaceutical for PET imaging of cancer in human patients.  Methods:   Copper-64 was produced by irradiation of natural CuO target in a medium flux research reactor. The irradiated target was radiochemically processed and detailed quality control analyses were carried out. Sub-acute toxicity studies were carried out with different doses of Cu in Wistar rats. The biological efficacy of the radiopharmaceutical was established in preclinical setting by biodistribution studies in melanoma tumor bearing mice. After getting regulatory approvals, [64Cu]CuCl2 formulation was clinically used for PET imaging of prostate cancer and glioblastoma patients.  Results:   Large-scale (~ 30 GBq) production of 64Cu could be achieved in a typical batch and it was adequate for formulation of clinical doses for multiple patients. The radiopharmaceutical met all the purity requirements for administration in human subjects. Studies carried out in animal model showed that the toxicity due to ""cold"" Cu in clinical dose of [64Cu]CuCl2 for PET scans would be negligible. Clinical PET scans showed satisfactory uptake of the radiopharmaceutical in the primary cancer and its metastatic sites.  Conclusions:   To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study on use of reactor produced [64Cu]CuCl2 for PET imaging of cancer in human patients.

The aim of this retrospective study is to compare concordance rates regarding side of lesion and Gleason Score at fusion targeted/systematic biopsy and MRI with the definitive histologic report of prostatectomy specimen.  Methods:   115 patients underwent multiparametric (mp) MRI and successively fusion targeted/systematic biopsy. 107 patients, with a positive biopsy for PCa, further underwent laparoscopic/robotic radical prostatectomy. We compared surgical histologic report with biopsy histologic report for side of lesion and Gleason Score. We further compared PIRADS score at mpMRI with Gleason Score of both histologic reports.  Results:   Concordance rate for mpMRI lesion side was 74% compared to biopsy and 52.3% compared to surgical histologic report (p < 0.0001). Fusion targeted/systematic biopsy reported a concordance rate with surgical histologic report of 67.3% for side of the lesion, while Gleason Score was concordant for 73.6% for clinically significant cancer (Gleason Score ≥ 7) (p < 0.0001). PIRADS score ≥ 3 was further associated with clinically significant cancer at surgical histologic report in 92.4% of cases (p = 0.359).  Conclusion:   Multiparametric MRI of the prostate reaches a good and improvable accuracy in the detection of suspicious PCa before biopsy.

However, the site, timing of emergence, and incidence of VM in castration-resistant patients have not yet been fully elucidated.  Methods:   Demographic, surgical, pathological, and follow-up data of PC patients treated at Kanazawa University Hospital between January 2000 and December 2016 were retrospectively analyzed using their medical charts. From this data, risk factors of VM and survival of patients with VM were elucidated.  Results:   Of 1364 patients, 21 (1.5%) had VM at diagnosis. Of 179 (13.1%) castration-resistant patients, 55 experienced emergence of new VM during treatment course. Incidence of new VM, especially nonlung, such as liver and adrenal metastases, increased significantly in proportion with the number of prescribed treatments. Multivariate analysis revealed that T stage, M stage, age, and treatment history with androgen receptor (AR) signaling-targeted agents and/or taxanes significantly increased the risk of VM. Compared with the group with VM at diagnosis, survival after diagnosis of VM following treatment was significantly shorter.

The patient was diagnosed with synchronous multiple primary lung cancer (SMPLC) based on Martini-Melamed criteria and American College of Chest Physicians practice guidelines. An exome analysis of 315 genes in the two tumor lesions and a non-tumor lesion was conducted by using Illumina Nextseq500 platform from each tumor region to decipher a potential evolutional progress of SMPLC. Single or pair-end reads were first mapped to a human genome reference and filtered based on the mapping quality score. The read depth was ≥ 1 000× and the depth of coverage was 95%. The data revealed a discordant epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) from the separate lungs; additionally, a high frequency of point mutation on exon 9 H310P of the ERG gene was detected at the both sites of the tumor lesions. This case showed that a potential role of the molecular features analysis from each tumor lesion might contribute to the understanding of the evolutional development of SMPLC. This study suggests that the same environment may contribute certain gene(s) mutations in the same sites in the early stages of polyclonal tumor origins; meanwhile the extensive studies on these genes may help us understand the evolution and progress of tumor clones.""","""['Y Bao', 'J F Mo']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Beijing Da Xue Xue Bao Yi Xue Ban""","""['Synchronous Multiple Primary Lung Cancer Dignosed \u2029by Different Phenotype-genotype: A Case Report and Literature Review.', 'Unusual synchronous double primary treatment-naïve lung adenocarcinoma harboring T790M and L858R mutations in early-stage lung cancer.', 'Surgical treatment is an effective approach for patients with synchronous multiple primary lung cancers.', 'Concordant and Discordant EGFR Mutations in Patients With Multifocal Adenocarcinomas: Implications for EGFR-Targeted Therapy.', 'Molecular Testing in Multiple Synchronous Lung Adenocarcinomas: Case Report and Literature Review.']"""

The anti-cancer role of Icaritin (ICT, a traditional Chinese herbal medicine) has been reported in several types of cancer including PCa. Adipokines are novel adipocyte-specific secretory protein, which plays a key role in the development of various diseases including obesity, diabetes, atherosclerosis, and cancer. However, the function of ICT and the molecular mechanisms underlying its role in PCa regression through modulation of adipokines have not been studied. Here, we assessed the anti-cancer properties of ICT under the influence of human epidermal growth factor receptor type 2 (HER2) pathway modulating adipokines in obese PCa models. Materials and Methods: In this study, we used transgenic adenocarcinoma of mouse prostate (TRAMP), a well-established animal model for the study of PCa pathogenesis. All the animals were fed on a high-fat diet (HFD with 40% fat) and divided into two groups, one received ICT solution of 30 mg/kg body bwt (i.p) while the other group served as control without any ICT treatment. The mortality rate, tumor formation and fat ratio were assessed by histopathological and magnetic resonance analysis at different time points of 20th, 24th and 28th weeks. The protein expression of HER2 and serum levels of adipokines were measured using western blotting, IHC and multiplex immunoassays. The PCa grade in 12 TRAMP mice were longitudinally evaluated to visualize PCa development and progression upon post-surgery using PET/CT scanning. Results: We observed that ICT treatment significantly reduces the total mortality rate of TRAMP mice (p = 0.045) and the percentage of prostate intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) or PCa (p = 0.029). Interestingly, significantly decreased levels of leptin (p = 0.006 @20th wk) and the elevated levels of adiponectin (p = 0.030 @20th wk) were observed in different subgroups upon ICT treatment in a time-dependent manner. In addition, a decrease level of HER2 (p = 0.032 @28th wk) and an elevated level of PEA3 (p = 0.014 @28th wk) were also detected in ICT treated group. The PET/CT-based imaging showed that ICT vs non-ICT treated mice had different standard uptake value and metastasis. Discussion and Conclusion: Our results showed potent anti-cancer properties of ICT through the modulation of adipokine secretion may alter the expression and activation of HER2 pathway as an alternative mechanism to prevent PCa progression. Altogether, our findings indicate that ICT could be a promising cancer preventive agent with the potential to target and eradicate tumor cells in obese PCa patients.""","""['Xiaobo Wu', 'Xingbo Long', 'Chen Yang', 'Huan Chen', 'Christina Sharkey', 'Khalid Rashid', 'Mengbo Hu', 'Yufei Liu', 'Qi Huang', 'Qi Chen', 'Jimeng Hu', 'Haowen Jiang']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""J Cancer""","""['A novel anticancer agent icaritin inhibited proinflammatory cytokines in TRAMP mice.', 'Anticancer effect of icaritin on prostate cancer via regulating miR-381-3p and its target gene UBE2C.', 'High-fat diet-induced adipokine and cytokine alterations promote the progression of prostate cancer in vivo and in vitro.', 'Transgenic Adenocarcinoma of the Mouse Prostate (TRAMP) model: A good alternative to study PCa progression and chemoprevention approaches.', 'Research Evidence on High-Fat Diet-Induced Prostate Cancer Development and Progression.', 'Icaritin-loaded PLGA nanoparticles activate immunogenic cell death and facilitate tumor recruitment in mice with gastric cancer.', 'Preparation of Novel ICT-CMC-CD59sp Drug-Loaded Microspheres and Targeting Anti-Tumor Effect on Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma.', 'Role of the CTRP family in tumor development and progression.']"""

Concern remains about reproducibility of mpMRI to rule out clinically significant prostate cancer (csPCa) in real-world settings.  Objective:   To assess the diagnostic performance of mpMRI for csPCa in a real-world setting.  Design, setting, and participants:   A multicentre, retrospective cohort study, including men referred with raised prostate-specific antigen (PSA) or an abnormal digital rectal examination who had undergone mpMRI followed by transrectal or transperineal biopsy, was conducted. Patients could be biopsy naïve or have had previous negative biopsies.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   The primary definition for csPCa was International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) grade group (GG) ≥2 (any Gleason ≥7); the accuracy for other definitions was also evaluated.  Results and limitations:   Across ten sites, 2642 men were included (January 2011-November 2018). Mean age and PSA were 65.3yr (standard deviation [SD] 7.8yr) and 7.5ng/ml (SD 3.3ng/ml), respectively. Of the patients, 35.9% had ""negative MRI"" (scores 1-2); 51.9% underwent transrectal biopsy and 48.1% had transperineal biopsy, with 43.4% diagnosed with csPCa overall. The sensitivity and negative predictive value (NPV) for ISUP GG≥2 were 87.3% and 87.5%, respectively. The NPVs were 87.4% and 88.1% for men undergoing transrectal and transperineal biopsy, respectively. Specificity and positive predictive value of MRI were 49.8% and 49.2%, respectively. The sensitivity and NPV increased to 96.6% and 90.6%, respectively, when a PSA density threshold of 0.15ng/ml/ml was used in MRI scores 1-2; these metrics increased to 97.5% and 91.2%, respectively, for PSA density 0.12ng/ml/ml. ISUP GG≥3 (Gleason ≥4+3) was found in 2.4% (15/617) of men with MRI scores 1-2. They key limitations of this study are the heterogeneity and retrospective nature of the data.  Conclusions:   Multiparametric MRI when used in real-world settings is able to rule out csPCa accurately, suggesting that about one-third of men might avoid an immediate biopsy. Men should be counselled about the risk of missing some significant cancers.  Patient summary:   Multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a useful tool for ruling out prostate cancer, especially when combined with prostate-specific antigen density (PSAD). Previous results published from specialist centres can be reproduced at smaller institutions.

We recently identified MMP-7 as a potential serum marker for the prediction of response and survival in mCRPC patients who received docetaxel (DOC) chemotherapy. Here, we aimed to test this finding in an independent patient cohort and in addition to explore the prognostic potential of serum MMP-7 in abiraterone (ABI) or enzalutamide (ENZA) treated patients.  Methods and materials:   MMP-7 levels were measured in 836 serum samples from 320 mCRPC patients collected before and during DOC (n = 95), ABI (n = 140), or ENZA (n = 85) treatment by using the ELISA method. Results were correlated with clinical and follow-up data.  Results:   MMP-7 baseline levels were similar between the 3 treatment groups. In the ABI and ENZA cohorts, baseline MMP-7 levels were lower in patients with prior radical prostatectomy (P = 0.058 and P = 0.041, respectively). Baseline MMP-7 levels above the median were associated with shorter overall survival for the DOC (P = 0.001) and ENZA (P = 0.006) cohorts. Multivariable analyses in the DOC and ENZA cohorts revealed that high pretreatment MMP-7 level is an independent risk factor for patients' survival. In addition, in DOC-treated patients with high baseline MMP-7 level, marker decrease at the third DOC cycle was associated with improved survival. Patients with high baseline MMP-7 levels had better survival when treated with ABI compared to DOC or ENZA.  Conclusions:   We confirmed the prognostic value of pretreatment MMP-7 serum level and its changes as independent predictors of survival in DOC-treated mCRPC patients. In addition, high MMP-7 was a negative predictor in ENZA-treated but not in ABI-treated patients.

We previously showed that secreted extracellular nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (eNAMPT) is a multifunctional innate immunity regulator via TLR4 ligation which has been implicated in PCa progression. Here we investigate the role of eNAMPT as a diagnostic biomarker and therapeutic target in the progression of PCa.  Methods:   Tumor NAMPT expression and plasma eNAMPT level were evaluated in human subjects with various PCa tumor stages and high risk subjects followed-up clinically for PCa. The genetic regulation of NAMPT expression in PCa cells and the role of eNAMPT in PCa invasion were investigated utilizing in vitro and in vivo models.  Findings:   Marked NAMPT expression was detected in human extraprostatic-invasive PCa tissues compared to minimal expression of organ-confined PCa. Plasma eNAMPT levels were significantly elevated in PCa subjects compared to male controls, and significantly greater in subjects with extraprostatic-invasive PCa compared to subjects with organ-confined PCa. Plasma eNAMPT levels showed significant predictive value for diagnosing PCa. NAMPT expression and eNAMPT secretion were highly upregulated in human PCa cells in response to hypoxia-inducible factors and EGF. In vitro cell culture and in vivo preclinical mouse model studies confirmed eNAMPT-mediated enhancement of PCa invasiveness into muscle tissues and dramatic attenuation of PCa invasion by weekly treatment with an eNAMPT-neutralizing polyclonal antibody.  Interpretation:   This study suggests that eNAMPT is a potential biomarker for PCa, especially invasive PCa.

Effective doses to relatives and to population were computed to estimate the time to reach radioprotection dose constraints.  Methods and materials:   Measurements were obtained from 180 patients, whereas the body mass index was calculated and reported for 77 patients. The day after the implant, K˙ measurements were conducted at various skin distances and positions and converted to effective doses. A theoretical model was developed to estimate effective doses from total implanted activity. The latter was approximated with a 10-mL vial inside the patient.  Results:   The K˙ measurements showed a low correlation with the total implanted activity, albeit an increasing trend of K˙ was observed on increasing the activity. A stronger correlation was found between body mass index and K˙ measurements. The effective dose to population is in general lower than dose constraints as well as the effective doses to relatives, with the exception of children and pregnant women, who command special precautions. We report differences between the experimental model- and theoretical model-based dose evaluation together with their comparison with previous studies found in literature.

Aim of the study is to validate a novel intermediate-risk subclassification (""magnetic resonance imaging [MRI] subclassification"") that defines favorable and unfavorable diseases based on multiparametric MRI parameters and compare it to NCCN and AUA intermediate-risk subclassifications.  Methods:   A total of 429 patients treated with radical prostatectomy for NCCN intermediate-risk prostate cancer were identified. Using MRI subclassification, a favorable disease was defined as an organ-confined disease on MRI and international society of urological pathology Grade Group 1 to 2 on targeted biopsy. Remaining was classified as unfavorable. Univariable and multivariable analysis tested MRI subclassification in predicting overall unfavorable disease (OUD: pT3-4 and/or pN1 and/or International Society of Urological Pathology Grade Group ≥ 3), the need for adjuvant therapy and early biochemical recurrence (eBCR). Performance of NCCN, AUA, and MRI models was compared in term of OUD proportion and eBCR prediction using Harrell's c-index, calibrations plots, and decision curve analysis.  Results:   Median (interquartile range) follow-up was 12 months (4-28). In multivariable analysis, MRI subclassification was an independent factor for OUD (odds ratio [OR]: 4.54 [2.85-7.22], P < 0.001), the need for adjuvant therapy (OR: 3.42 [1.36-8.57], P = 0.009), and eBCR (HR: 2.62 [1.18-5.83], P = 0.018). Using this model, the proportion of unfavorable disease decreased from 73.7% and 63.9% to 35.9% (P < 0.001) associated to an increasing proportion of OUD when compared to NCCN and AUA models (63.9% and 67.1%-77.9% respectively, P < 0.001). Performance of the 3 models for eBCR prediction tended to be similar with a poor accuracy ranged from 58.7% to 66.7% (P > 0.05), permanent miscalibration and a net benefit at decision curve analysis.  Conclusions:   We validated an intermediate-risk subclassification based on MRI and targeted biopsy that potentially improves patient selection by reducing the number of patients considered at unfavorable risk while increasing proportion of patients harboring poor oncologic outcomes.

Reliable burden estimates will help guide resource allocation. This study aimed to perform a nationwide cost analysis of the direct and indirect costs of the top ten most costly cancers, and acute coronary syndrome (ACS), as a comparison, in Taiwan.  Setting:   A population-based cohort study.  Participants:   In total, 545 221 patients with newly diagnosed cancer (lung cancer, female breast cancer, colorectal cancer, liver cancer, oral cancer, leukaemia, prostate cancer, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, gastric cancer and oesophageal cancer) and 170 879 patients with ACS between 2007 and 2014 were identified.  Primary and secondary outcome measures:   Direct medical costs were calculated from claims recorded in the National Health Insurance Research Database . Indirect costs, comprising morbidity-associated and mortality-associated productivity losses, were estimated from public life expectancy, average wage and employment data. The costs incurred in the 3 years after diagnosis were assessed. As a comparison, the cost of ACS was also estimated using the same study frame. A cost driver analysis was conducted to identify factors impacting cancer costs.  Results:   The cancers with the highest mean direct medical costs and total costs were leukaemia (US$28 464) and oesophageal cancer (US$81 775), respectively. Indirect costs accounted for over 50% of the total economic burden of most cancers, except for prostate cancer and female breast cancer. The costs of ACS were lower than those of most cancers. From the cost driver analysis, older age at diagnosis significantly (p<0.05) decreased the total cost of cancer; in contrast, male, tumour metastasis, comorbidities and treatment in medical centres increased the costs.  Conclusions:   This study demonstrates the comprehensive economic burden of the top 10 most costly cancers in Taiwan.

This study aimed to investigate whether chronic NaAsO2 exposure elevates stemness and chemoresistance in prostate cancer cells. DU145 (wild-type p53) and PC-3 (p53-null) cells were exposed to NaAsO2 (2 μmol/L) for 30 generations. IC50s to docetaxel and cisplatin were increased in NaAsO2-exposed DU145 and PC-3 cells. The number of tumor spheres was elevated in NaAsO2-exposed DU145 and PC-3 cells. Nanog, SOX-2 and ALDH1A1, three markers of cancer stemness, were upregulated in NaAsO2-exposed PC-3 spheres. Moreover, NaAsO2-exposed DU145 and PC-3 cells were arrested in G2/M phase. Histone H2AX phosphorylation on Ser139, an indicator for DNA double-strand break, was upregulated in NaAsO2-exposed DU145 and PC-3 cells. ATM phosphorylation on Ser1981, a key sensor of genotoxic stress, was rapidly elevated in NaAsO2-exposed DU145 cells. Phosphor-p53, a downstream molecule of ATM signaling, and p21, a direct target of p53, were upregulated in NaAsO2-exposed DU145 cells. Unexpectedly, p21 was also elevated in NaAsO2-exposed p53-null PC-3 cells. Antioxidant NAC alleviated NaAsO2-induced ATM phosphorylation, cell cycle arrest, and subsequent stemness enhancement and chemoresistance in both DU145 and PC-3 cells.

The focus of the first clinical implementation was the case of high-risk prostate cancer, including pelvic node irradiation.  Methods and materials:   One hundred two HTT clinical plans were selected to train a KB model using the RapidPlan tool incorporated in the Eclipse system (v13.6, Varian Inc). The individually optimized KB-based templates were converted into HTT-like templates and sent automatically to the HTT treatment planning system through scripting. The full dose calculation was set after 300 iterations without any additional planner intervention. Internal (20 patients in the training cohort) and external (28 new patients) validation were performed to assess the performance of the model: Automatic HTT plans (KB-TP) were compared against the original plans (TP) in terms of organs at risk and planning target volume (PTV) dose-volume parameters and by blinded clinical evaluation of 3 expert clinicians.  Results:   KB-TP plans were generally better than or equivalent to TP plans in both validation cohorts. A significant improvement in PTVs and rectum-PTV overlap dosimetry parameters were observed for both sets. Organ-at-risk sparing for KB-TP was slightly improved, which was more evident in the external validation group and for bladder and bowel. Clinical evaluation reported KB-TP to be better in 60% of cases and worse in 10% compared with TP (P < .05).

Meta-analysis of publicly available data showed increased BOP1 expression in metastatic CaP and recurrent CaP, and was inversely associated with overall survival. Multiplexed immunohistochemistry was used to analyze expression and localization of BOP1 and nucleolar protein 56 in human tissue samples from various stages of CaP progression. Here, increased BOP1 expression was observed at later stages of CaP progression, coinciding with a localization change from nuclear to cytoplasmic. In patient samples, cytoplasmic BOP1 was also inversely associated with overall survival. In models of prostate cancer progression, BOP1 expression showed expression and localization similar to that in human patient samples. The functional significance of BOP1 in metastatic CaP was assessed by genetic knockdown, where BOP1 knockdown resulted in decreased proliferation and motility compared with control.

The antioxidant potential of DpL was evaluated by estimating the total flavonoid and total phenolic content (TFC and TPC, respectively). Additionally, we investigated the effects of the DpL ethyl acetate fraction (DpLE) on cell proliferation, intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, apoptosis, and cell cycle arrest in this cell line. The expression levels of superoxide dismutase (SOD)-1, SOD-2, B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) and Bcl-2 associated X (Bax) ratio, phospho-protein kinase B (p-AKT), cleaved caspase-8, poly adenosine diphosphate (ADP) ribose polymerase (PARP), and cleaved-PARP were evaluated by western blotting. The results indicated that DpLE causes apoptosis and exerts intracellular ROS-independent anticancer effects on prostate cancer cells, associated with increased SOD-2, cleaved caspase-8, and cleaved-PARP expression and inhibited p-AKT signaling.

The aim of this analysis was to compare patient-reported outcomes (PROs) after EBRT versus brachytherapy.  Materials and methods:   In a multicenter prospective cohort study, patients with incurable esophageal cancer requiring palliation of dysphagia were included to undergo EBRT (20 Gy in 5 fractions). This EBRT cohort was compared to the single-dose 12 Gy brachytherapy cohort of the previously reported SIREC-trial. Propensity score matching was applied to adjust for baseline imbalances. The primary endpoint of dysphagia improvement was reported previously. PROs were secondary outcomes and assessed at baseline and 3 months after treatment using EORTC QLQ-C30 and QLQ-OES18 questionnaires.  Results:   A total of 115 enrolled EBRT patients and 93 brachytherapy patients were eligible. After matching, 69 well-balanced pairs remained. At follow-up, significant deteriorations in functioning (i.e. physical, role, social), pain, appetite loss, and trouble with taste were observed after brachytherapy. In the EBRT group, such deterioration was observed only for role functioning, while significant improvements in trouble with eating and pain were found. Between-group comparison showed mostly comparable PRO changes, but significantly favored EBRT with regard to nausea, vomiting, pain, and appetite loss.

In this study, we aimed to explore the effects of miR-300 on the adhesion, invasion, and migration of PC cells by targeting Disabled 1 (DAB1). Firstly, the regulatory role of miRNAs on DAB1 was predicted by screening PC-related differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Immunohistochemistry was applied to determine the positive protein expression of DAB1, after which the target relationship between miR-300 and DAB1 was examined. Loss-of-function and gain-of-function experiments were conducted to determine cell proliferation, adhesion, migration, invasion capability, and cell cycle of PC cells. Our data illustrated that DAB1 had a low expression, while miR-300 was expressed at a relatively high level in PC tissues. Moreover, our clinicopathological analysis revealed that there was a correlation between miR-300 and tumor, node, metastases stage, Gleason score, and lymph node metastasis of PC patients. DAB1 was also found to be poorly expressed in PC based on the findings from the microarray analysis. The results from dual-luciferase reporter gene assay corroborated that miR-300 interacts with DAB1. Importantly, overexpression of miR-300 and/or si-DAB1 resulted in the enhancement of RAC1, MMP2, MMP9, CyclinD1, and CyclinE expressions, whereas the expression of DAB1 and Rap was reduced in PC cells, thus suggesting that down-regulated miR-300 suppressed proliferation, adhesion, migration, and invasion of PC cells.

However, the mechanism of FGF13 function during cancer cell proliferation remains to be unexplored, especially Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In this study, the cell proliferation effect of FGF13 on A549 cells was checked by CCK-8, clone formation, Ki67 immunofluorescence staining and Flow Cytometry assay. Localization of FGF13 within A549 cells was performed with confocal laser scanning microscope. The protein variations and interaction were measured by western blotting and co-immunoprecipitation analysis. It showed that FGF13 was mainly distributed in the cytoplasm and exhibited a high expression level in A549 cells. High expression of FGF13 activated AKT-GSK3 signaling pathway, and inhibited the activity of p21 and p27. Thus, FGF13 enhanced the process of transition from G1 to S phase and promoted A549 cells proliferation. Furthermore, the interaction between FGF13 and SHCBP1 was confirmed.

Methods:   The patient data used in this study was obtained from a French national multicenter database of patients treated for PC with SpM between 2014 and 2017. A total of 72 patients and 365 SpM cases were diagnosed.  Results:   The median overall survival time for all patients following the event of SpM was 28.8 months. First, we identified three significant survival prognostic factors of PC patients with SpM: good Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group/World Health Organization personnel status (Status 0 hazard ratio [HR]: 0.031, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.008-0.127; p < .0001) or (Status 1 HR: 0.163, 95% CI: 0.068-0.393; p < .0001) and SpM radiotherapy (HR: 2.923, 95% CI: 1.059-8.069; p < .0001). Secondly, the presence of osteolytic lesions of the spine (vs. osteoblastic) was found to represent an independent prognosis factor for longer survival [HR: 0.424, 95% CI: 0.216-0.830; p = .01]. Other factors including the number of SpM, surgery, extraspinal metastasis, synchrone metastasis, metastasis-free survival, and SpM recurrence were not identified as being prognostically relevant to the survival of patients with PC.  Conclusion:   Survival and our ability to estimate it in patients presenting PC with SpM have improved significantly. Therefore, we advocate the relevance of updating SpM prognostic scoring algorithms by incorporating data regarding the timeline of PC as well as the presence of osteolytic SpM to conceive treatments that are adapted to each patient.""","""['Aymeric Amelot', 'Louis-Marie Terrier', 'Louis-Romée Le Nail', 'Joseph Cristini', 'Ann-Rose Cook', 'Kévin Buffenoir', 'Hugues Pascal-Moussellard', 'Alexandre Carpentier', 'Arnaud Dubory', 'Bertrand Mathon']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Survival in breast cancer patients with spine metastases: Prognostic assessment involving molecular markers.', 'Spine Metastasis in Elderly: Encouraging Results for Better Survival.', 'Short-term androgen deprivation therapy combined with radiotherapy as salvage treatment after radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer (GETUG-AFU 16): a 112-month follow-up of a phase 3, randomised trial.', 'Spinal metastases from thyroid cancer: Some prognostic factors.', 'Spinal metastases from lung cancer: Survival depends only on genotype, neurological and personal status, scarcely of surgical resection.', 'Spinal Metastases and the Evolving Role of Molecular Targeted Therapy, Chemotherapy, and Immunotherapy.', 'Survival Rate after Palliative Surgery Alone for Symptomatic Spinal Metastases: A Prospective Cohort Study.', 'Ten Years After SINS: Role of Surgery and Radiotherapy in the Management of Patients With Vertebral Metastases.', 'Review of imaging techniques for evaluating morphological and functional responses to the treatment of bone metastases in prostate and breast cancer.']"""

Although pelvic floor muscle training can successfully treat postprostatectomy incontinence, evidence for how muscle movement affects continence recovery is lacking. We evaluated dynamic factors of prostatectomy patients using cine magnetic resonance imaging to identify risk factors for postprostatectomy incontinence and reveal the contribution of pelvic floor muscles to continence recovery.  Methods:   A total of 128 prostate cancer patients who underwent robot-assisted laparoscopic surgery were enrolled. Cine magnetic resonance imaging was performed preoperatively and 6 months after surgery. Continence was defined as pad-free or use of safety pads. We defined the bladder neck elevation distance during pelvic floor muscle training as the bladder elevation distance. Patients with continence recovery within 1 month comprised the continence group (n = 48); other patients comprised the incontinence group (n = 80).  Results:   The preoperative bladder elevation distance was significantly longer in the continence group than in the incontinence group (10.4 vs. 8.2 mm; p < .001). The postoperative bladder elevation distance of the continence group tended to be longer (9.9 vs. 8.9 mm; p = .057). Multivariate analysis showed that the preoperative bladder elevation distance significantly contributed to continence recovery (p = .016). Patients with a longer preoperative bladder elevation distance (>8.5 mm) experienced continence recovery significantly faster than patients with a shorter distance (<8.5mm) (p = .038).

The purpose of this study is to quantify performance of a pixelwise segmentation algorithm that was trained using different combinations of weak and strong stroma, epithelium, and lumen labels in a prostate histology dataset. Approach: We have combined weakly labeled datasets generated using simple morphometric techniques and high-quality labeled datasets from human observers in prostate biopsy cores to train a convolutional neural network for use in whole mount prostate labeling pipelines. With trained networks, we characterize pixelwise segmentation of stromal, epithelium, and lumen (SEL) regions on both biopsy core and whole-mount H&E-stained tissue.

Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is considered as the most important receptor of SARS-CoV-2 and wildly expressed in human tissues. Whereas, the extremely low expression of ACE2 in lung could hardly interpret the severe symptom of pneumonia in COVID-19 patients. Here we profiled two SARS-CoV-2 infection related genes, the transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) and the interferon-inducible transmembrane protein 3 (IFITM3), in human tissues and organs. Consistent with the expression and distribution of ACE2, TMPRSS2 was also highly expressed in digestive, urinary and reproductive systems, but low expressed in lung. Notably, the anti-virus protein IFITM3 also expressed much lower in lung than other tissues, which might be related to the severe lung symptoms of COVID-19. In addition, the low expression of IFITM3 in immune cells suggested that SARS-CoV-2 might attack lymphocytes and induce the cytokine release syndrome (CRS). Furthermore, cancer patients were considered as more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our data supposed that fourteen types of tumors might have different susceptibility to the virus according to ACE2, TMPRSS2 and IFITM3 expression patterns. Interestingly the prognosis of six types of cancers including breast carcinoma (BRCA), lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma (UCEC), renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC), prostate adenocarcinoma (PRAD), and hepatocellular carcinoma (LIHC) were closely related to these gene expressions. Our study explored the expression and distribution profiles of two potential novel molecules that might participate in SARS-CoV-2 infection and involved in immunity, which may provide a functional basis for preventing infection of SARS-CoV-2.""","""['Yu-Jun Dai', 'Wei-Na Zhang', 'Wei-Da Wang', 'Si-Yuan He', 'Cheng-Cai Liang', 'Da-Wei Wang']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Int J Biol Sci""","""['Gene expression and in situ protein profiling of candidate SARS-CoV-2 receptors in human airway epithelial cells and lung tissue.', 'ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression by clinical, HLA, immune, and microbial correlates across 34 human cancers and matched normal tissues: implications for SARS-CoV-2 COVID-19.', 'Single-cell analysis of SARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE2 and spike protein priming expression of proteases in the human heart.', 'Interaction of SARS-CoV-2 and Other Coronavirus With ACE (Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme)-2 as Their Main Receptor: Therapeutic Implications.', 'ACE2, TMPRSS2 distribution and extrapulmonary organ injury in patients with COVID-19.', 'COVID-19-The Shift of Homeostasis into Oncopathology or Chronic Fibrosis in Terms of Female Reproductive System Involvement.', 'Molecular mechanisms involved in pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2: Immune evasion and implications for therapeutic strategies.', 'Comprehensive analysis of the novel omicron receptor AXL in cancers.', 'Role of genetic variants and host polymorphisms on COVID-19: From viral entrance mechanisms to immunological reactions.', 'Interactions of renin-angiotensin system and COVID-19: the importance of daily rhythms in ACE2, ADAM17 and TMPRSS2 expression.']"""

Methods:   A glutathione (GSH)-responsive cationic HPAA was prepared by the Michael addition reaction. Furthermore, HPAA-PEG was produced by PEGylation, and then the aptamer targeted to prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) was conjugated to the HPAA-PEG. The obtained HPAA-PEG-APT could form nanocomplexes with miRNA-133a-3p through electrostatic adsorption.  Results:   The results of immunocytochemistry indicated that the complexes could target PSMA-expressing LNCaP cells. The ability of HPAA-PEG-APT to facilitate the delivery of miRNA-133a-3p into LNCaP cells was proven, and HPAA-PEG-APT/miRNA-133a-3p demonstrated enhanced antitumor activity, lower cytotoxicity and better biocompatibility in vitro.

We retrospectively reviewed all Oligo-PCa patients treated with radiotherapy to the primary tumor sites and metastatic tumor burden at our institution between March 2010 and June 2019. All patients having ≤ 5 metastases involving nodes and/or bones, loco-regional and/or extra-pelvic sites, were included. Most of the patients had started androgen deprivation therapy with or without docetaxel as standard of care before radiotherapy. The Kaplan Meier analysis was performed to estimate survival outcomes. The univariate analysis tested possible prognostic factors increasing the rate of biochemical relapse. We analysed 37 Oligo-PCa patients. Twenty-eight (75.7%) had loco-regional metastases, in 9 patients (24.3%) the metastatic tumour burden was extra-pelvic. Nineteen (51.4%) had bone metastases, 21 (56.8%) nodal involvement and 7 (18.9%) both. Twenty (54.1%) had a single metastasis. The median follow-up was 55.5 months. The median overall survival (OS) was 68.8 months, the 2- and 5-year OS rates were 96.9% and 65.4%. The median biochemical relapse free survival (b-RFS) was 58 months and the 2- and 5-year b-RFS rates were 73.3% and 39.3%. The 2- and 5-year local relapse free survival rates were 93.9% and 83.7%. On the univariate analysis post-treatment PSA level ≤ 1 ng/ml was significantly related with the b-RFS (p = 0.004). Curative approach in Oligo-PCa patients involving both the primary tumor and metastatic sites may be feasible and well tolerate. Many patients presented longer survival and PSA at first follow-up was the most important prognostic factor. Further trials are needed to confirm our results and to evaluate if patients with PSA at first follow-up > 1 ng/ml may benefit from further treatments.""","""['C Reverberi', 'M Massaro', 'M F Osti', 'D Anzellini', 'L Marinelli', 'A Montalto', 'V De Sanctis', 'M Valeriani']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Sci Rep""","""['Influence of localization of PSMA-positive oligo-metastases on efficacy of metastasis-directed external-beam radiotherapy-a multicenter retrospective study.', 'Prostate-specific membrane antigen-positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PSMA-PET/CT)-guided stereotactic ablative body radiotherapy for oligometastatic prostate cancer: a single-institution experience and review of the published literature.', 'Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy for Oligometastatic Prostate Cancer Detected via Prostate-specific Membrane Antigen Positron Emission Tomography.', 'Cytoreductive Radical Prostatectomy in Men with Prostate Cancer and Skeletal Metastases.', 'Novel Insights into the Management of Oligometastatic Prostate Cancer: A Comprehensive Review.', 'What is the ideal combination therapy in de novo, oligometastatic, castration-sensitive prostate cancer?', 'Bone-only oligometastatic prostate cancer: can SABR improve outcomes?

Data regarding the impact of COVID-19 on cancer patients (CPs) undergoing or candidate for immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are lacking. We depicted the practice and adaptations in the management of patients with solid tumors eligible or receiving ICIs during the COVID-19 pandemic, with a special focus on Campania region.  Methods:   This survey (25 questions), promoted by the young section of SCITO (Società Campana di ImmunoTerapia Oncologica) Group, was circulated among Italian young oncologists practicing in regions variously affected by the pandemic: high (group 1), medium (group 2) and low (group 3) prevalence of SARS-CoV-2-positive patients. For Campania region, the physician responders were split into those working in cancer centers (CC), university hospitals (UH) and general hospitals (GH). Percentages of agreement, among High (H) versus Medium (M) and versus Low (L) group for Italy and among CC, UH and GH for Campania region, were compared by using Fisher's exact tests for dichotomous answers and χ2 test for trends relative to the questions with 3 or more options.  Results:   This is the first Italian study to investigate the COVID-19 impact on cancer immunotherapy, unique in its type and very clear in the results. The COVID-19 pandemic seemed not to affect the standard practice in the prescription and delivery of ICIs in Italy. Telemedicine was widely used. There was high consensus to interrupt immunotherapy in SARS-CoV-2-positive patients and to adopt ICIs with longer schedule interval. The majority of the responders tended not to delay the start of ICIs; there were no changes in supportive treatments, but some of the physicians opted for delaying surgeries (if part of patients' planned treatment approach). The results from responders in Campania did not differ significantly from the national ones.  Conclusion:   Our study highlights the efforts of Italian oncologists to maintain high standards of care for CPs treated with ICIs, regardless the regional prevalence of COVID-19, suggesting the adoption of similar solutions. Research on patients treated with ICIs and experiencing COVID-19 will clarify the safety profile to continue the treatments, thus informing on the most appropriate clinical conducts.""","""['Margaret Ottaviano', 'Marcello Curvietto', 'Pasquale Rescigno', 'Marianna Tortora', 'Giovannella Palmieri', 'Diana Giannarelli', 'Michele Aieta', 'Pasquale Assalone', 'Laura Attademo', 'Antonio Avallone', 'Francesco Bloise', 'Davide Bosso', 'Valentina Borzillo', 'Giuseppe Buono', 'Giuseppe Calderoni', 'Francesca Caputo', 'Giacomo Cartenì', 'Diletta Cavallero', 'Alessia Cavo', 'Fortunato Ciardiello', 'Raffaele Conca', 'Vincenza Conteduca', 'Stefano De Falco', 'Marco De Felice', 'Michelino De Laurentiis', 'Pietro De Placido', 'Sabino De Placido', 'Irene De Santo', 'Alfonso De Stefano', 'Carminia Maria Della Corte', 'Rossella Di Franco', 'Vincenzo Di Lauro', 'Antonietta Fabbrocini', 'Piera Federico', 'Lucia Festino', 'Pasqualina Giordano', 'Mario Giuliano', 'Cesare Gridelli', 'Antonio Maria Grimaldi', 'Michela Lia', 'Antonella Lucia Marretta', 'Valentina Massa', 'Alessia Mennitto', 'Sara Merler', 'Valeria Merz', 'Carlo Messina', 'Marco Messina', 'Monica Milano', 'Alessandro Marco Minisini', 'Vincenzo Montesarchio', 'Alessandro Morabito', 'Floriana Morgillo', 'Brigitta Mucci', 'Lucia Nappi', 'Fabiana Napolitano', 'Immacolata Paciolla', 'Martina Pagliuca', 'Giuseppe Palmieri', 'Sara Parola', 'Stefano Pepe', 'Angelica Petrillo', 'Francovito Piantedosi', 'Luisa Piccin', 'Fernanda Picozzi', 'Erica Pietroluongo', 'Sandro Pignata', 'Veronica Prati', 'Vittorio Riccio', 'Mario Rosanova', 'Alice Rossi', 'Anna Russo', 'Massimiliano Salati', 'Giuseppe Santabarbara', 'Andrea Sbrana', 'Ester Simeone', 'Antonia Silvestri', 'Massimiliano Spada', 'Paolo Tarantino', 'Paola Taveggia', 'Federica Tomei', 'Tortora Vincenzo', 'Dario Trapani', 'Claudia Trojanello', 'Vito Vanella', 'Sabrina Vari', 'Jole Ventriglia', 'Maria Grazia Vitale', 'Fabiana Vitiello', 'Caterina Vivaldi', 'Claudia von Arx', 'Francesca Zacchi', 'Ilaria Zampiva', 'Andrea Zivi', 'Bruno Daniele', 'Paolo Antonio Ascierto;SCITO (Società Campana di ImmunoTerapia Oncologica)']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""J Immunother Cancer""","""['Impact of COVID-19 on patients with rheumatic complications of cancer immunotherapy: results of a registry survey.', 'Immunotherapy is a preferred option for oral cancer patients during COVID-19 pandemic?', ""Survey of the Impact of COVID-19 on Oncologists' Decision Making in Cancer."", 'Interventional radiology under the era of coronavirus disease 2019: Recommendations from the Chinese College of Interventionalists.', 'COVID-19 Outbreak in North Italy: An Overview on Dentistry.

Cesium-131 (131Cs) has a higher dose rate and shorter dose delivery time resulting in decreased duration of acute urinary morbidity. Long-term data suggest excellent oncologic outcomes; it is not known how outcomes compare. A prospective randomized trial comparing the two isotopes was initiated.  Materials and methods:   Patients with low- or intermediate-risk disease were treated with a BT in a single outpatient facility. Prescription dose was 144 Gy for 125I and 115 Gy for 131Cs. Androgen deprivation or supplemental EBRT was not allowed. The primary study objective was comparison of the mean EPIC Urinary Domain Score. Secondary objective was biochemical relapse-free survival (BRFS) comparison. Time-to-event for all outcomes of interest was measured from implant date.  Results:   One hundred forty men were enrolled; 81.4% were low-risk and 18.6% were intermediate-risk. The median followup was 97 months. Urinary and sexual health-related quality of life did not differ between isotopes at any recorded time point. At 2 months after implantation, bowel health-related quality of life was worse with 125I; however, this difference was lost at subsequent time points. The 9-year BRFS was 87.2% and 84.0% for the 125I and 131Cs group, respectively (p = 0.897). There was no statistically significant difference in BRFS based on initial T stage, PSA, or Gleason score.  Conclusions:   Short- and long-term urinary, sexual, and bowel quality of life, as well as long-term biochemical control were comparable between 125I and 131Cs.

In vitro studies revealed an increase in ANXA1 expression after AR knockdown or treatment with AR antagonist. Moreover, functional assays indicated that ANXA1 knockdown in PCa cells significantly inhibited cell migration, while ANXA1 overexpression in PCa cells significantly accelerated cell migration.

The recent literature shows that several clinical factors may be related to PCa aggressiveness. The aim of this study is to investigate the potential associations between clinical factors and the risk of multiple lymph node invasion (LNI) in patients with intermediate- and high-risk localized PCa (cT1/2, cN0, and ISUP grading group >2 and/or prostate-specific antigen (PSA) >10 ng/mL) who underwent radical prostatectomy (RP) and extended pelvic lymph node dissection (ePLND).  Materials and methods:   In a period ranging from January 2014 to December 2018, 880 consecutive patients underwent RP with ePLND for PCa. Among these, 481 met the inclusion criteria and were selected. Data were prospectively collected within an institutional dataset and retrospectively analyzed. Age (years), body mass index (BMI; kg/m2), PSA (ng/mL), prostate volume (mL), and biopsy positive cores (BPC; %) were recorded for each case. BMI and BPC were considered continuous and categorical variables, respectively. The logistic regression models evaluated the association of clinical factors with the risk of nodal metastases.  Results:   LNI was detected in 73/418 patients (15.2%) of whom 40/418 (8.3%) harbored multiple LNI (median 2, IQR: 3-4). On multivariate analysis, BMI was independently associated with the risk of multiple LNI in the pathological specimen when compared with patients without LNI (OR = 1.147; p = 0.018), as well as the percentage of biopsy positive cores (OR = 1.028; p < 0.0001) and European Association of Urology high-risk class (OR = 5.486; p < 0.0001).

Turmeric, made from the rhizome of Curcuma longa L., is a well-known HM prescribed in the polyherbal formulas for cancer treatment in traditional Chinese medicines (TCMs). However, neither the multiple anticancer compounds of turmeric nor the integration effects of these components are fully known.  Aim of the study:   This work aims to develop a systematic approach to reveal the integration effect mechanisms of multiple anticancer compounds in turmeric against prostate cancer PC3 cells.  Materials and methods:   Combination index and omics technologies were applied to profile the integration effect mechanisms of bioactive compounds in proportions naturally found in turmeric. PC3 cell line (a prostate cancer cell line) fishing and high resolution mass spectrometry were employed to screen and identify the anticancer compounds from turmeric. The combinations which contain different cell-bound compounds in natural proportions were prepared for further evaluation of anti-cancer activity by using cell viability assays, and assessment of cell apoptosis and cell cycle analysis. Combination index analysis was applied to study the integration effects of the anticancer compounds in their natural proportions. Finally, quantitative glycoproteomics/proteomics and Western blot were implemented to reveal the potential synergistic effect mechanisms of the anticancer compounds based on their natural proportions in turmeric.  Results:   Three curcuminoids (curcumin, CUR; demethoxycurcumin, DMC; bisdemethoxycurcumin, BDMC) in turmeric were discovered and shown to possess significant synergistic anticancer activities. Combination index analysis revealed an additive effect of CUR combined with DMC or BDMC and a slight synergistic effect of DMC combined with BDMC in natural proportions in turmeric, while a combination of all three curcuminoids (CUR, DMC and BDMC) at a ratio of 1:1:1 yielded superior synergistic effects. Interestingly, the presence of BDMC and DMC are essential for synergistic effect. Glycoproteomics and proteomics demonstrated that different curcuminoids regulate various protein pathways, such as ribosome, glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, biosynthesis of amino acids, and combination of CUR + DMC + BDMC showed the most powerful effects on down-regulation of protein expression.

For this study, we generated stable CRISPR/Cas9 TRPM4 knockout (K.O.) cells from the human prostate cancer cell line DU145 and analyzed the cells for changes in cancer hallmark functions. Both TRPM4-K.O. clones demonstrated lower proliferation and viability compared to the parental cells. Migration was also impaired in the TRPM4-K.O. cells. Additionally, analysis of 210 prostate cancer patient tissues demonstrates a positive association between TRPM4 protein expression and local/metastatic progression. Moreover, a decreased adhesion rate was detected in the two K.O. clones compared to DU145 cells. Next, we tested three novel TRPM4 inhibitors with whole-cell patch clamp technique for their potential to block TRPM4 currents. CBA, NBA and LBA partially inhibited TRPM4 currents in DU145 cells. However, none of these inhibitors demonstrated any TRPM4-specific effect in the cellular assays. To evaluate if the observed effect of TRPM4 K.O. on migration, viability, and cell cycle is linked to TRPM4 ion conductivity, we transfected TRPM4-K.O. cells with either TRPM4 wild-type or a dominant-negative mutant, non-permeable to Na+. Our data showed a partial rescue of the viability of cells expressing functional TRPM4, while the pore mutant was not able to rescue this phenotype. For cell cycle distribution, TRPM4 ion conductivity was not essential since TRPM4 wild-type and the pore mutant rescued the phenotype. In conclusion, TRPM4 contributes to viability, migration, cell cycle shift, and adhesion; however, blocking TRPM4 ion conductivity is insufficient to prevent its role in cancer hallmark functions in prostate cancer cells.""","""['Anna Borgström', 'Barbara Hauert', 'Sven Kappel', 'Eugenio Zoni', 'Mirjam Kiener', 'Paulina Stokłosa', 'Roland Baur', 'Martin Spahn', 'Marianna Kruithof-de Julio', 'Christine Peinelt']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""J Mol Biol""","""['TRPM4 is highly expressed in human colorectal tumor buds and contributes to proliferation, cell cycle, and invasion of colorectal cancer cells.', 'TRPM4 in Cancer-A New Potential Drug Target.', 'Investigation of Novel Small Molecular TRPM4 Inhibitors in Colorectal Cancer Cells.', 'Transient receptor potential melastatin 4 channel contributes to migration of androgen-insensitive prostate cancer cells.', 'From cardiac cation channels to the molecular dissection of the transient receptor potential channel TRPM4.', 'Calcium signalling pathways in prostate cancer initiation and progression.', 'On the modulation of TRPM channels: Current perspectives and anticancer therapeutic implications.', 'The regulatory and modulatory roles of TRP family channels in malignant tumors and relevant therapeutic strategies.', 'A Novel Role of the TRPM4 Ion Channel in Exocytosis.', 'Pharmacological Modulation and (Patho)Physiological Roles of TRPM4 Channel-Part 1: Modulation of TRPM4.']"""

This workflow was constructed using MIM® software with the intention to provide accurate dose transformations for plans with two different isocentres, whereby two sequential treatment phases were prescribed. The pre-processing steps for data extractions from treatment plans, CBCTs, determination of couch shift information and management of missing CBCTs are described. To ensure that the imported translational couch shifts were in the correct orientation and readable in MIM, phantom commissioning was performed. For dose transformation, rigid registration with corrected setup shifts and scaled fractional dose was performed for pCT to daily CBCTs, which were then deformed onto CBCT1 . Fractional dose summation resulted in the final accumulated dose for the patient allowing differences in dosimetry between the planned and accumulated dose to be analysed. Contour propagations of the prostate, bladder and rectum were performed within the same workflow. Transformed contours were then deformed onto daily CBCTs to generate trending reports for analysis, including Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) and Mean Distance to Agreement (MDA).

Molecular subtypes may aid in distinguishing indolent cases from aggressive cases and improving management of the disease. However, molecular features of PCa outside the seven subtypes are still not well studied. Here we report molecular features of PCa cases without typical features of the established subtypes. We performed comprehensive genomic analysis of 91 patients, including 54 primary and 37 metastatic cases, by whole-exome sequencing. TP53, SPOP, FOXA1, AR (androgen receptor) and a TMPRSS2-ERG fusion emerged as the most commonly altered genes in primary cases, whereas AR, FOXA1, PTEN, CDK12, APC and TP53 were the most commonly altered genes in metastatic cases. Nuclear receptor corepressor (NCOR1) genomic alterations have been identified in 5% of cases, which are nontypical molecular features of PCa subtypes. A novel NCOR1 c.2182G>C (p.Val728Leu) was identified in tumor. RT-PCR was used to show that this mutation caused loss of NCOR1 exon 19 and might be oncogenic in PCa. NCOR1 is involved in maintenance of mitochondrial membrane potential in PCa cells, and loss of NCOR1 might contribute to PCa progression.

The lack of standardized steroid replacement strategies can lead to variability in care and delays in starting docetaxel.  Methods:   This randomized trial compared physician-directed with fixed-dose dexamethasone. Patients who had missed at least one dose of steroid premedication were randomized to physician-directed replacement (any choice of steroid, dose or route) or to dexamethasone 8 mg oral before starting docetaxel. The primary outcome was time from randomization to starting docetaxel. Secondary outcomes included rates of acute and delayed hypersensitivity reactions, fluid retention and skin toxicity.  Results:   Of 60 eligible patients, 30 (50%) and 30 (50%) were randomized to physician-directed and fixed-dose arms, respectively. Overall tumour types: breast (42 [70%]), gastrointestinal (7 [12%]), prostate (7 [12%]) and lung (3 [7%]). Dexamethasone was most commonly incompletely taken with cycles 1 (28 [48%]) and 2 (13 [22%]) of docetaxel. Seven different replacement strategies were used in the physician-choice arm. Patients in the fixed-dose arm received docetaxel a mean of 21.2 (95% CI for the difference is 2.1 to 44.6) minutes earlier than the physician-choice arm (p = 0.033 Wilcoxon rank sum test or p = 0.073 two-sample t test). Median time to docetaxel was 47.5 vs 61 min (mean 62.2 vs 83.4 min) by arm, respectively. No significant difference in toxicity rates was observed.  Conclusion:   While not meeting our predefined criteria of improving the time from randomization to starting docetaxel by 30 min, the fixed-dose replacement strategy reduced both the time to starting docetaxel and treatment variability. Fixed dosing with oral dexamethasone 8 mg should be the preferred standard of care.

The purpose of the study was to determine whether the introduction of a suspension stitch would improve early urinary continence rates in patients undergoing robotic prostatectomy for localized prostate cancer at our department. We retrospectively reviewed patients undergoing robotic prostatectomy with either suspension (n = 119) or figure-of-eight (n = 48) stitching of the dorsal venous complex. The patients submitted EPIC-26 questionnaires before surgery and after 3 and 18 months, respectively. Logistic regression analysis was run to determine the effect of the suspension stitch, nerve-sparing, posterior reconstruction, prostate volume, age and body mass index on early continence rate. The odds ratio of experiencing urinary leaks was 2.1 times higher (95% CI 1.0-4.3) in the figure-of-eight stitch group compared to the suspension stitch group 3 months after surgery (p < 0.05). The early urinary continence rate was 61.3% in the suspension stitch group compared to 35.4% in the figure-of-eight stitch group (p < 0.005). There were no differences between the groups 18 months post-prostatectomy (90.7% in the suspension stitch group versus 81.4% in the non-suspension stitch group, p = 0.1). Ordinal regression analysis identified the suspension stitch, bilateral nerve-sparing and body mass index as independent predictors of urinary continence at 3 months. The association between urinary continence and either unilateral nerve-sparing, posterior reconstruction, prostate volume or age did not reach statistical significance.

Most of the studies have been based on a single time-point measure, most commonly of body mass index (BMI) during adulthood. Emerging data suggest a complex pattern that may be better understood through a life course approach. The data suggest that early life adiposity, possibly before or during puberty, as being associated with lower risk of advanced prostate cancer. In contrast, moderate weight gain in men who were initially lean during pre-adulthood or early adulthood may increase risk of advanced prostate cancer. This pattern suggests competing factors associated with overall adiposity, some protective and some adverse. Factors that may increase risk appear to show more strongly in men who maintain a relatively low BMI but have a high waist circumference or waist:hip ratio. Possibly, this pattern may be associated with relatively high levels of factors associated with insulin resistance and related metabolic abnormalities (mostly central adiposity) while avoiding the protective factors (mostly generalized or subcutaneous adiposity). Broad measures at one time-point, such as adult BMI, are not likely to contribute further to our understanding. Instead, direct measures of visceral fat might be useful. For feasibility, combined measures, such as examining waist:hip ratio among men with normal BMI in relation to risk, might be useful.

For most major cancers, including breast, prostate, lung, ovarian, and pancreatic cancer, population screening is still controversial or is not recommended by expert bodies. Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) is an exciting new cancer biomarker with potential applicability to all cancer types. Recent investigations have shown that genetic alterations or epigenetic modifications in ctDNA could be used for cancer detection with a liquid biopsy (i.e., a tube of blood). Tests based on ctDNA have attracted considerable attention for various applications, such as patient management, prognosis, early diagnosis, and population screening. Recently, new biotechnology companies were founded, with the goal of revolutionizing early cancer detection by using ctDNA. We previously examined this technology, as published by various academic laboratories and of one leading company, Grail, and drew attention to potential obstacles. After 3 years of intense development, this technology seems to have made some progress. Here, we will analyze the latest clinical data presented by Grail in October 2019, during the inaugural American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) 2019 Breakthrough Conference.

Case presentation:   A 72-year-old man presented at our hospital with prostate cancer and underwent RARP. After pneumoperitoneum, severe bradycardia and CAVB were observed; thus, the surgery was extended by inserting a temporary pacemaker (TPM).  Conclusion:   Because of the difficulty in performing emergency procedures in robot-assisted surgeries, the current case is reported to provide an awareness that surgeons should be cautious of the possible complication of bradycardia and CAVB during such operations, and thus should take steps necessary for managing induction of such conditions.""","""['Fumito Yamabe', 'Yozo Mitsui', 'Orie Hoshino', 'Tomo Shimizu', 'Mizuki Kasahara', 'Hideyuki Kobayashi', 'Koichi Nakajima']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""BMC Surg""","""['Safety of Robot-Assisted Radical Prostatectomy with Pneumoperitoneum of 20\u2009mm Hg: A Study of 751 Patients.', 'Reduction in postoperative ileus rates utilizing lower pressure pneumoperitoneum in robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy.', 'Extraperitoneal Single-Port Robot-Assisted Radical Prostatectomy.', 'Methods for training of robot-assisted radical prostatectomy.', 'Robot-assisted radical prostatectomy in prostate cancer.']"""

However, little is known about its clinicopathologic features and prognostic implications.  Design:   We conducted a retrospective pan-tumor survey on 346 cases of BRCA-associated tumors in males. Comparative analyses were conducted among male and female patients with BRCAm (n = 349), as well as in male patients without BRCAm (n = 4577).  Results:   Similar incidences of BRCAm (6.0 vs. 6.6%) and age at diagnosis of tumor (median, 65 vs. 60 years) were observed in male and female patients. Carcinomas of the lung, bladder, stomach, and cutaneous melanoma were the frequent tumors demonstrating BRCAm in males, of which the majority were stage II or III diseases with a higher frequency of BRCA2 mutations. Compared to that in the non-BRCAm group, cutaneous melanoma (16.3 vs. 5.0%), lung cancer (19.4 vs. 11.8%), bladder cancer (15.6 vs. 5.6%), and stomach cancer (11.9 vs. 5.5%) accounted for a higher proportion in the BRCAm group. Advanced disease and more mutation counts (median, 322 vs. 63 mutations) were also found in the BRCAm group. A total of 127 BRCA1 and 311 BRCA2 mutations were identified, of which 21.8 and 28.6% were deleterious, respectively. Frequent deleterious variants were identified in carcinomas of the breast (100.0%), colorectum (62.2%), prostate (43.3%), and stomach (42.9%). BRCA1 fusions with NF1, FAM134C, BECN1, or LSM12 and recurrent BRCA2 mutations at P606L/S, E832K/G, and T3033Lfs*29 were detected. Frameshift mutations in BRCA2 at N1784 (N1784Kfs*3, N1784Tfs*3) were frequently observed in both male and female patients. Compared with those in females, BRCA mutations in males were associated with decreased overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS). Male patients with deleterious BRCAm displayed increased OS compared with non-BRCAm carriers. The subgroup analysis demonstrated that BRCAm was associated with increased OS in gastric and bladder cancers, decreased PFS in prostate, esophageal, and head and neck cancers, and decreased OS in glioma/glioblastoma in males.  Conclusion:   These findings provide an overview of the distinct characteristics and clinical outcomes of male patients with BRCA-associated tumors, suggesting the importance of further genetic BRCA testing in males.""","""['Peng Sun', 'Yue Li', 'Xue Chao', 'Jibin Li', 'Rongzhen Luo', 'Mei Li', 'Jiehua He']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""BMC Cancer""","""['BRCA testing and outcomes in women with breast cancer.', 'Male BRCA mutation carriers: clinical characteristics and cancer spectrum.', 'Overall survival and clinical characteristics of BRCA mutation carriers with stage I/II pancreatic cancer.', 'Overall Survival and Clinical Characteristics of BRCA-Associated Cholangiocarcinoma: A Multicenter Retrospective Study.', 'Prognostic significance of BRCA mutations in ovarian cancer: an updated systematic review with meta-analysis.', 'Gastric Cancer Risk and Pathogenesis in BRCA1 and BRCA2 Carriers.', 'Next-generation sequencing based detection of BRCA1 and BRCA2 large genomic rearrangements in Chinese cancer patients.', 'Identification of a 6-RBP gene signature for a comprehensive analysis of glioma and ischemic stroke: Cognitive impairment and aging-related hypoxic stress.', 'First description of the t(3;17)(q27;q21)/IGF2BP2::LSM12 translocation in marginal zone lymphoma.', 'Endo-Lysosomal Two-Pore Channels and Their Protein Partners.']"""

However, limited studies are available on toxicity of Mandarin peel oil (MPO) on human Prostate Cancer (PC3) cells. Therefore, the present study was conducted to study the cytotoxicity and genotoxicity of MPO on Human normal Fibroblast (HFB4) and PC3 cell lines. The half maximal inhibitory (IC50) and safe concentration of MPO was detected using MTT assay. Comet and DNA fragmentation assays were performed to assess apoptotic DNA damage. Also, the ROS level was evaluated and the mRNA expression level of apoptotic and antiapoptotic genes were measured using RT-PCR. Results of the cytotoxic test showed that MPO induced preferential inhibition of PC3 cells proliferation in a concentration-dependent manner with IC50 10.97 µg/ml. The time-dependent induction of DNA breaks demonstrated in PC3 cells treated with MPO safe concentration-stimulated ROS generation and apoptotic DNA damage through increased expression of tumor suppressor p53 and Bax genes and decreased expression of Bcl2 and MDM2 genes. In contrast, non-significant changes were observed in the DNA integrity, ROS levels and expressions of the tested genes in the normal HFB4 cells treated with MPO. Thus, we concluded that MPO induced preferential cytotoxic and genotoxic effects toward cancerous PC3 with no noticeable toxic effects in normal HFB4 cells and therefore further in vivo studies are recommended to test its possible use as anticancer drugs.""","""['Nahed Ahmed Hussien', 'Hanan Ramadan Hamad Mohamed']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Toxicol Mech Methods""","""['Estimation of Calcium Titanate or Erbium Oxide Nanoparticles Induced\xa0Cytotoxicity and Genotoxicity in Normal HSF Cells.', 'Investigation of mechanism(s) of DNA damage induced by 4-monochlorobiphenyl (PCB3) metabolites.', 'Biological Activity, Apoptotic Induction and Cell Cycle Arrest of New Hydrazonoyl Halides Derivatives.', 'The comet assay with multiple mouse organs: comparison of comet assay results and carcinogenicity with 208 chemicals selected from the IARC monographs and U.S. NTP Carcinogenicity Database.', 'Genotoxicity of environmental agents assessed by the alkaline comet assay.', 'Suppression of tumor growth and apoptosis induction by pomegranate seed nano-emulsion in mice bearing solid Ehrlich carcinoma cells.']"""

The prediction consists of two steps. First, projections of the desired dose are calculated and then inversely mapped to fluence maps in the phantom geometry by a deep neural network. Second, a plan scaling technique is applied to scale fluence maps from phantom to patient geometry. We evaluated the performance of the proposed fluence map prediction method for 102 head and neck (H&N) and 14 prostate cancer VMAT plans by comparing the patient doses calculated from the predicted fluence maps with the given desired dose distributions. The mean dose differences were 1.42% ± 0.37%, 1.53% ± 0.44% and 1.25% ± 0.44% for the planning target volume (PTV), the region from the PTV boundary to the 50% isodose line, and the region from the 50% to the 20% isodose line, respectively. The gamma passing rate was 98.06% ± 2.64% with the 3 mm/3% criterion. The prediction time for a single VMAT plan was less than one second. In conclusion, we developed an inverse mapping-based method that predicts fluence maps for desired dose distributions with high accuracy.

Deep learning applications in radiology often suffer from overfitting, limiting generalization to external centers. The objective of this study was to develop a high-quality prostate segmentation model capable of maintaining a high degree of performance across multiple independent datasets using transfer learning and data augmentation. MATERIALS AND METHODS. A retrospective cohort of 648 patients who underwent prostate MRI between February 2015 and November 2018 at a single center was used for training and validation. A deep learning approach combining 2D and 3D architecture was used for training, which incorporated transfer learning. A data augmentation strategy was used that was specific to the deformations, intensity, and alterations in image quality seen on radiology images. Five independent datasets, four of which were from outside centers, were used for testing, which was conducted with and without fine-tuning of the original model. The Dice similarity coefficient was used to evaluate model performance. RESULTS. When prostate segmentation models utilizing transfer learning were applied to the internal validation cohort, the mean Dice similarity coefficient was 93.1 for whole prostate and 89.0 for transition zone segmentations. When the models were applied to multiple test set cohorts, the improvement in performance achieved using data augmentation alone was 2.2% for the whole prostate models and 3.0% for the transition zone segmentation models. However, the best test-set results were obtained with models fine-tuned on test center data with mean Dice similarity coefficients of 91.5 for whole prostate segmentation and 89.7 for transition zone segmentation.

Despite advances in prostate cancer treatment, rates of biochemical recurrence remain high, relating to lack of detection of small-volume metastatic disease using conventional imaging for initial staging. OBJECTIVE. The purpose of this study was to assess the potential use of 18F-fluciclovine PET/MRI for initial staging of high-risk prostate cancer and evaluating response to androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). METHODS. This prospective clinical trial enrolled 14 men with newly diagnosed high-risk prostate cancer and negative or equivocal conventional staging imaging for metastatic disease between January 2018 and February 2019. All patients underwent pretreatment 18F-fluciclovine PET/MRI including multiparametric prostate MRI; 12 underwent 18F-fluciclovine PET/MRI after surgery or between ADT and radiotherapy. Confidence in identification of the primary intraprostatic lesion and nodal metastases was independently rated on a 0-3 Likert scale by three readers with nuclear medicine experience for 18F-fluciclovine PET/MRI and three readers with abdominal imaging experience for MRI alone. Findings scored as 2 or 3 by at least two readers of a given modality were considered positive. A single reader measured SUVmean, SUVmax, and volume of the MRI-defined intraprostatic lesion and SUVmax of suspicious lymph nodes on PET before and after initiation of ADT. Changes in SUV were analyzed using nonparametric Wilcox-on signed-rank tests. RESULTS. The biopsy-proven lesion in the prostate gland was accurately identified in all 14 patients on both MRI and 18F-fluciclovine PET/MRI. Suspected nodal metastases were detected in three patients on MRI and seven patients on 18F-fluciclovine PET/MRI. After ADT, all patients showed decreased activity within the intraprostatic lesion and/or all suspicious lymph nodes. The primary lesion SUVmean was 4.5 ± 1.1 (range, 2.7-6.5) before treatment and 2.4 ± 1.1 (range, 0.0-3.6) after initiation of ADT (p = .008). For suspicious lymph nodes, the pretreatment SUVmax was 5.5 ± 3.7 (range, 2.8-12.7) and the post-treatment SUVmax was 2.8 ± 1.4 (range, 1.4-5.5) (p = .03). CONCLUSION.18F-labeled fluciclovine PET/MRI shows potential utility in initial staging of high-risk prostate cancer and in evaluating response to ADT. CLINICAL IMPACT.

Being one such receptor, FAM134B plays critical roles in cellular processes such as protein quality control and neuronal survival. FAM134B has also been associated with different cancers, although its exact role remains elusive. We report here that the FAM134B gene encodes not one but at least two different protein isoforms: the full-length and the NH2 terminally truncated forms. Their relative expression shows extreme variation, both within normal tissues and among cancer types. Expression of full-length FAM134B is restricted to the brain, testis, spleen, and prostate. In contrast, NH2 terminally truncated FAM134B is dominant in the heart, skeletal muscle, kidney, pancreas, and liver. We compared wild-type and knockout mice to study the role of the Fam134b gene in starvation. NH2 terminally truncated FAM134B-2 was induced in the liver, skeletal muscle, and heart but not in the pancreas and stomach following starvation. Upon starvation, Fam134b-/- mice differed from wild-type mice by less weight loss and less hyperaminoacidemic and hypocalcemic response but increased levels of serum albumin, total serum proteins, and α-amylase. Interestingly, either NH2 terminally truncated FAM134B or both isoforms were downregulated in liver, lung, and colon cancers. In contrast, upregulation was observed in stomach and chromophobe kidney cancers.NEW & NOTEWORTHY We reported tissues expressing FAM134B-2 such as the kidney, muscle, heart, and pancreas, some of which exhibit stimulated expression upon nutrient starvation. We also demonstrated the effect of Fam134b deletion during ad libitum and starvation conditions. Resistance to weight loss and hypocalcemia, accompanied by an increase in serum albumin and α-amylase levels, indicate critical roles of Fam134b in physiology. Furthermore, the differential expression of FAM134B isoforms was shown to be significantly dysregulated in human cancers.""","""['Umur Keles', 'Evin Iscan', 'Huriye Erbak Yilmaz', 'Gökhan Karakülah', 'Aslı Suner', 'Erhan Bal', 'Nilgun Tasdemir', 'Ayse Derya Cavga', 'Umut Ekin', 'Zeynep Mutlu', 'Sila Kahyaoglu', 'Muhittin A Serdar', 'Nese Atabey', 'Mehmet Ozturk']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Am J Physiol Gastrointest Liver Physiol""","""['An N-terminal-truncated isoform of FAM134B (FAM134B-2) regulates starvation-induced hepatic selective ER-phagy.', 'MiT/TFE factors control ER-phagy via transcriptional regulation of FAM134B.', 'Excessive ER-phagy mediated by the autophagy receptor FAM134B results in ER stress, the unfolded protein response, and cell death in HeLa cells.', 'The pivotal role of FAM134B in selective ER-phagy and diseases.', 'RETREG1 (FAM134B): A new player in human diseases: 15 years after the discovery in cancer.', 'Role of endoplasmic reticulum autophagy in acute lung injury.', 'Protein quality control and aggregation in the endoplasmic reticulum: From basic to bedside.', 'ER-phagy: mechanisms, regulation, and diseases connected to the lysosomal clearance of the endoplasmic reticulum.', 'N-glycan processing selects ERAD-resistant misfolded proteins for ER-to-lysosome-associated degradation.']"""

The carcinogenic effects of cisplatin were well established, and its side effects had shown close connections with the urinary system. The study aimed to evaluate how the characteristics of the primary testicular nonseminoma are associated with urological second malignant neoplasms and survival outcomes.  Methods:   Using the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results database, standardized incidence ratios (SIR) for three major urological tumors including kidney, bladder, and prostate cancer were calculated for 10,734 patients with testicular nonseminoma from 1975 to 2016. The survival analyses were performed using the Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank test, risk factors for overall survival were determined by Cox regression.  Results:   We identified a total of 197 patients with secondary urological neoplasms.

We report the preclinical and clinical translation of PEG-AVP0458 to a first-in-human clinical trial of a diabody. Methods: Clinical translation followed characterization of PEG-AVP0458 drug product and preclinical biodistribution and imaging assessments of Iodine-124 trace labeled PEG-AVP0458 (124I-PEG-AVP0458). The primary study objective of the first-in-human study was the safety of a single protein dose of 1.0 or 10 mg/m2 124I-PEG-AVP0458 in patients with TAG-72 positive relapsed/ metastatic prostate or ovarian cancer. Secondary study objectives were evaluation of the biodistribution, tumor uptake, pharmacokinetics and immunogenicity. Patients were infused with a single-dose of 124I labeled PEG-AVP0458 (3-5 mCi (111-185 MBq) for positron emission tomography (PET) imaging, performed sequentially over a one-week period. Safety, pharmacokinetics, biodistribution, and immunogenicity were assessed up to 28 days after infusion. Results: PEG-AVP0458 was radiolabeled with 124I and shown to retain high TAG-72 affinity and excellent targeting of TAG-72 positive xenografts by biodistribution analysis and PET imaging. In the first-in-human trial, no adverse events or toxicity attributable to 124I-PEG-AVP0458 were observed. Imaging was evaluable in 5 patients, with rapid and highly specific targeting of tumor and minimal normal organ uptake, leading to high tumor:blood ratios. Serum concentration values of 124I-PEG-AVP0458 showed consistent values between patients, and there was no significant difference in T½α and T½β between dose levels with mean (± SD) results of T½α = 5.10 ± 4.58 hours, T½β = 46.19 ± 13.06 hours.

The proposed system is innovative because it can deliver RSBT through multiple implanted needles independently, in serial, using flexible catheters, with no inter-needle shielding effects and without the need to rotate multiple shielded catheters inside the needles simultaneously, resulting in a simple, mechanically robust, delivery approach. RSBT was compared to conventional 192 Ir-based high-dose-rate brachytherapy (HDR-BT) in a treatment planning study with dose escalation and urethral sparing goals, representing single-fraction brachytherapy monotherapy and brachytherapy as a boost to external beam radiotherapy, respectively. A prototype mechanical delivery system was constructed and quantitatively evaluated as a proof of concept.  Methods:   Treatment plans for twenty-six patients with single fraction prescriptions of 20.5 and 15 Gy, were created for dose escalation and urethral sparing, respectively. The RSBT and HDR-BT delivery systems were modeled with one partially shielded 999 GBq (27 Ci) 169 Yb source and one 370 GBq (10 Ci) 192 Ir source, respectively. A prototype angular drive system for helical source delivery was constructed. Mechanical accuracy measurements of source translational position and angular orientation in a simulated treatment delivery setup were obtained using the prototype system.  Results:   For dose escalation, with equivalent urethra D10% , PTV D90% for RSBT vs HDR-BT increased from 22.6 ± 0.0 Gy (average ± standard deviation) to 29.3 ± 0.9 Gy, or 29.9 % ± 3.0%, with treatment times of 51.4 ± 6.1 min for RSBT and 15.8 ± 2.3 min for 10 Ci 192 Ir-based HDR-BT. For urethra sparing, with equivalent PTV D90 % , urethra D10% for RSBT vs HDR-BT decreased for RSBT vs HDR-BT from 15.6 ± 0.4 Gy to 12.0 ± 0.4 Gy, or 23.1% ± 3.5%, with treatment times of 30.0 ± 3.7 min for RSBT and 12.3 ± 1.8 min for HDR-BT. Differences between measured vs predicted rotating catheter positions (corresponding to source position) were within 0.18 mm ± 0.12 mm longitudinally and 0.07° ± 0.78°.  Conclusion: 169 Yb-based RSBT can increase PTV D90% or decrease urethral D10% relative to HDR-BT with treatment times of less than 1 h using a single-source robotic delivery system with treatment delivered in a single fraction.

Methods:   We followed all men (n = 25,126) and their female cohabiting partners (n = 8785) without a history of cancer or antidepressants from the Danish Diet, Cancer and Health cohort from 1997 to 2014 or 2010, respectively. We estimated the cumulative incidence of first-time antidepressant prescriptions in men with prostate cancer compared with cancer-free men and their respective female partners, using the Danish National Prescription Registry. Sociodemographic, lifestyle-related, and clinical risk factors were assessed using Cox regression models.  Results:   A total of 1828 men were diagnosed with prostate cancer of whom 15% received antidepressants. The unadjusted hazard ratio of antidepressant prescription was 2.18 (95%CI, 1.92, 2.48) for men with prostate cancer and 1.27 (95%CI, 0.87, 1.85) for their partners, compared with cancer-free men and their partners, respectively. After adjusting for sociodemographic, lifestyle-related, and comorbidity factors, this risk was 2-fold to 4-fold increased among patients, but not significantly increased among partners. Significant risk factors among patients were curative and palliative treatment (vs. active surveillance and watchful waiting), nonlocalized disease, and short education.  Conclusions:   Men with prostate cancer have a higher risk of receiving antidepressant medication than cancer-free men. Clinical characteristics can help clinicians in identifying patients at a high risk of depression or anxiety.

The Prostate MRI Imaging Study (PROMIS) provides a unique opportunity to explore such phenotypes in biopsy-naïve men with raised prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and suspected cancer.  Objective:   To compare mpMRI lesions in men with/without significant cancer on transperineal mapping biopsy (TPM).  Design, setting, and participants:   PROMIS participants (n=235) underwent mpMRI followed by a combined biopsy procedure at University College London Hospital, including 5-mm TPM as the reference standard. Patients were divided into four mutually exclusive groups according to TPM findings: (1) no cancer, (2) insignificant cancer, (3) definition 2 significant cancer (Gleason ≥3+4 of any length and/or maximum cancer core length ≥4mm of any grade), and (4) definition 1 significant cancer (Gleason ≥4+3 of any length and/or maximum cancer core length ≥6mm of any grade).  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Index and/or additional lesions present in 178 participants were compared between TPM groups in terms of number, conspicuity, volume, location, and radiological characteristics.  Results and limitations:   Most lesions were located in the peripheral zone. More men with significant cancer had two or more lesions than those without significant disease (67% vs 37%; p< 0.001). In the former group, index lesions were larger (mean volume 0.68 vs 0.50 ml; p< 0.001, Wilcoxon test), more conspicuous (Likert 4-5: 79% vs 22%; p< 0.001), and diffusion restricted (mean apparent diffusion coefficient [ADC]: 0.73 vs 0.86; p< 0.001, Wilcoxon test). In men with Likert 3 index lesions, log2PSA density and index lesion ADC were significant predictors of definition 1/2 disease in a logistic regression model (mean cross-validated area under the receiver-operator characteristic curve: 0.77 [95% confidence interval: 0.67-0.87]).  Conclusions:   Significant cancer-associated MRI lesions in biopsy-naïve men have clinical-radiological differences, with lesions seen in prostates without significant disease. MRI-calculated PSA density and ADC could predict significant cancer in those with indeterminate MRI phenotypes.  Patient summary:   Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) lesions that mimic prostate cancer but are, in fact, benign prompt unnecessary biopsies in thousands of men with raised prostate-specific antigen. In this study we found that, on closer look, such false positive lesions have different features from cancerous ones.

To identify new AR regulators, we focused on Mixed lineage leukemia 5 (MLL5), a histone-regulating enzyme, because significantly higher MLL5 expression was detected in prostate cancer tissues than in matching normal tissues. When we expressed shRNAs targeting MLL5 gene in prostate cancer cell line, the growth rate and AR activity were reduced compared to those in control cells, and migration ability of the knockdown cells was reduced significantly. To determine the molecular mechanisms of MLL5 on AR activity, we proved that AR physically interacted with MLL5 and other co-factors, including SET-1 and HCF-1, using an immunoprecipitation method. The chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis showed reduced binding of MLL5, co-factors, and AR enzymes to AR target gene promoters in MLL5 shRNA-expressing cells. Histone H3K4 methylation on the AR target gene promoters was reduced, and H3K9 methylation at the same site was increased in MLL5 knockdown cells. Finally, xenograft tumor formation revealed that reduction of MLL5 in prostate cancer cells retarded tumor growth.

Conclusions:   This meta-analysis suggests that the rs4809960 polymorphism may affect the predisposition of cancer in Caucasians, and the rs6022999 polymorphism may affect the predisposition of cancer in Asians. Moreover, the rs2585428 polymorphism may affect the predisposition of prostate cancer, while the rs6068816 polymorphism may affect the predisposition of prostate cancer and breast cancer.""","""['Guoqiang Zhang', 'Maohe Jin']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Int J Biol Markers""","""['The associations between CYP24A1 polymorphisms and cancer susceptibility: A meta-analysis and trial sequential analysis.', 'Association study between CYP24A1 gene polymorphisms and cancer risk.', 'The association study between CYP24A1 gene polymorphisms and risk of liver, lung and gastric cancer in a Chinese population.', 'Association of rs27044 and rs30187 polymorphisms in endoplasmic reticulum aminopeptidase 1 gene and ankylosing spondylitis susceptibility: A meta-analysis.', 'Interleukin-23 receptor genetic polymorphisms and ulcerative colitis susceptibility: A meta-analysis.', 'Filling the gaps in the research about second primary malignancies after bladder cancer: Focus on race and histology.', 'Vitamin D-Related Genes and Thyroid Cancer-A Systematic Review.']"""

However, the highly immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment leads to DC dysfunction, which has limited the effectiveness of these vaccines. We hypothesized that use of a fully serotype 3 oncolytic adenovirus (Ad3-hTERT-CMV-hCD40L; TILT-234) could stimulate DCs in the prostate tumor microenvironment by expressing CD40L. Activated DCs would then activate cytotoxic T cells against the tumor, resulting in therapeutic immune responses. Oncolytic cell killing due to cancer cell-specific virus replication adds to antitumor effects but also enhances the immunological effect by releasing tumor epitopes for sampling by DC, in the presence of danger signals. In this study, we evaluated the companion effect of Ad3-hTERT-CMV-hCD40L and DC-therapy in a humanized mouse model and PC histocultures. Treatment with Ad3-hTERT-CMV-hCD40L and DC resulted in enhanced antitumor responses in vivo. Treatment of established histocultures with Ad3-hTERT-CMV-hCD40L induced DC maturation and notable increase in proinflammatory cytokines.

IMI also has inhibitory effects against various cancer types, including prostate cancer; however, the mechanism of its anticancer activity is not well understood. In the present study, we investigated the antimetastatic and anti-invasive effects of IMI in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer PC-3 cells, with an emphasis on the serine/threonine protein kinase AKT-mediated nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) signaling pathway. While IMI did not induce cell death, it attenuated PC-3 cell proliferation. According to the wound healing assay and invasion assay, migration and invasion in PC-3 cells were significantly inhibited by IMI in a dose-dependent manner. IMI significantly downregulated p-AKT protein expression but upregulated phospho-extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK1)/2 protein expression levels. Furthermore, IMI treatment resulted in decreased AKT-mediated downstream signaling, including p-inhibitor of κB kinase (IKK)α/β, p-inhibitor of κB (IκBα), and p-p65. Inhibited NF-κB signaling reduced the secretion of several proinflammatory cytokines and chemokine by PC-3 cells. Overall, our study explored the negative correlation between the use of antidepressants and prostate cancer progression, showing that IMI attenuated cell viability, migration, and invasion of PC-3 cells by suppressing the expression of AKT and NF-κB-related signaling proteins and secretion of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1).""","""['Eun Yeong Lim', 'Joon Park', 'Yun Tai Kim', 'Min Jung Kim']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Molecules""","""['Thymoquinone inhibits IL-7-induced tumor progression and metastatic invasion in prostate cancer cells by attenuating matrix metalloproteinase activity and Akt/NF-κB signaling.', 'Curcumin (diferuloylmethane) down-regulates expression of cell proliferation and antiapoptotic and metastatic gene products through suppression of IkappaBalpha kinase and Akt activation.', 'Suppression of NF-kappaB and NF-kappaB-regulated gene expression by sulforaphane and PEITC through IkappaBalpha, IKK pathway in human prostate cancer PC-3 cells.', 'Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) upregulates heparanase expression via the PI3K/Akt/NF-κB signaling pathway for gastric cancer metastasis.', ""Osteopontin: it's role in regulation of cell motility and nuclear factor kappa B-mediated urokinase type plasminogen activator expression."", 'Small Extracellular Vesicles as a New Class of Medicines.', 'Repurposing Antidepressants and Phenothiazine Antipsychotics as Efflux Pump Inhibitors in Cancer and Infectious Diseases.', 'Bioinformatics Analysis of miRNAs Targeting TRAF5 in DLBCL Involving in NF-κB Signaling Pathway and Affecting the Apoptosis and Signal Transduction.', 'Controlling Nanoparticle Uptake in Innate Immune Cells with Heparosan Polysaccharides.', 'Antitumoral Effects of Tricyclic Antidepressants: Beyond Neuropathic Pain Treatment.']"""

Deep learning is a state-of-the-art technique for MR image-based prostate cancer diagnosis, but one of major bottlenecks is the severe lack of annotated MR images. The traditional and Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)-based data augmentation methods cannot ensure the quality and the diversity of generated training samples. In this paper, we have proposed a novel GAN model for synthesis of MR images by utilizing its powerful ability in modeling the complex data distributions. The proposed model is designed based on the architecture of deep convolutional GAN. To learn the more equivariant representation of images that is robust to the changes in the pose and spatial relationship of objects in the images, the capsule network is applied to replace CNN used in the discriminator of regular GAN. Meanwhile, the least squares loss has been adopted for both the generator and discriminator in the proposed GAN to address the vanishing gradient problem of sigmoid cross entropy loss function in regular GAN. Extensive experiments are conducted on the simulated and real MR images. The results demonstrate that the proposed capsule network-based GAN model can generate more realistic and higher quality MR images than the compared GANs. The quantitative comparisons show that among all evaluated models, the proposed GAN generally achieves the smallest Kullback-Leibler divergence values for image generation task and provides the best classification performance when it is introduced into the deep learning method for image classification task.""","""['Houqiang Yu', 'Xuming Zhang']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Sensors (Basel)""","""['Shape constrained fully convolutional DenseNet with adversarial training for multiorgan segmentation on head and neck CT and low-field MR images.', 'A GAN-based image synthesis method for skin lesion classification.', 'Ea-GANs: Edge-Aware Generative Adversarial Networks for Cross-Modality MR Image Synthesis.', 'Generative Adversarial Networks and Its Applications in Biomedical Informatics.', 'Generative Adversarial Networks: A Primer for Radiologists.', 'A Review Paper about Deep Learning for Medical Image Analysis.', 'Enhancing cancer differentiation with synthetic MRI examinations via generative models: a systematic review.']"""

However, 2'-fluoro-4'-seleno-ara-C (F-Se-Ara-C), a new generation of cytarabine (Ara-C) analogs, exhibited potent antitumor activity against the p53-deficient prostate cancer cell line PC-3. The distinct activity of F-Se-Ara-C was achieved by targeting the synthetic lethal interaction between p53 and mitogen-activated protein kinase-activated protein kinase-2 (MK2). MK2 is a checkpoint effector for DNA damage responses to drive cell cycle arrest and DNA repair in p53-deficient cancer cells. Therefore, targeting MK2 may be an effective therapeutic strategy that induces apoptosis for cancers deficient in p53. F-Se-Ara-C effectively induced anti-prostate cancer activity in vitro and in vivo by inhibition of MK2 activation in p53-deficient prostate cancer cells. Moreover, combining F-Se-Ara-C with cabozantinib, an anticancer drug currently in clinical use, induced synergistic antitumor activity in p53-deficient prostate cancer cells.

All patients were without evidence of metastatic disease. Freedom from biochemical failure (FFbF), prostate cancer specific survival (PCaSS), and overall survival (OS) were determined using the Kaplan-Meier estimates. Cox proportional hazard models were used to identify factors predictive of FFbF. Toxicity was graded by Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v5.0.  Results:   108 patients were included. Median follow-up was 6.3 years. The 5- and 10-year actuarial survival outcomes were as follows: FFbF, 63.1% and 52.0%; PCaSS, 90.5% and 77.8%; OS, 80.9% and 56.7%.

We aimed to compare patient-reported outcomes of EBRT to those of EBRT-BB.  Methods and materials:   Patients diagnosed with intermediate-risk, high-risk or locally advanced prostate cancer (April 2014 to September 2016), who received EBRT in the English National Health Service within 18 months of diagnosis and responded to a national patient questionnaire, were identified from the National Prostate Cancer Audit. Adjusted linear regression was used to estimate differences in functional EPIC-26 domains and HRQoL (EQ-5D-5L) between treatment groups. Non-inferiority of EBRT-BB was determined if the lower 95% confidence limit did not exceed the established minimal clinically important difference (MCID).  Results:   Of the 13,259 included men, 12,503 (94.3%) received EBRT and 756 (5.7%) received EBRT-BB. EBRT-BB was non-inferior compared to EBRT for the urinary incontinence, sexual, bowel and hormonal EPIC-26 domains. EBRT-BB resulted in significantly worse urinary irritation/obstruction scores than EBRT (-6.1; 95% CI: -8.8 to -3.4) but uncertainty remains as to whether this difference is clinically important (corresponding MCID of 5).  Conclusions:   There is no evidence to suggest that EBRT-BB results in any clinically important detriment in functional outcomes or HRQoL compared to men receiving EBRT only.

The 2015 Open Payments data were used to characterize promotional payments made to physicians at the market level. Generalized linear models were then used to measure the relationship between market-level payments to urologists and the physician specialty prescribing abiraterone or enzalutamide for the first time RESULTS: In 2015, 2318 men filled a prescription for abiraterone or enzalutamide by a urologist or medical oncologist.

Assessment:   Four radiologists interpreted the Bp-MRI (T2 WI and DWI) and Mp-MRI (T2 WI, DWI, and DCE) independently according to the Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS). For Op-MRI, two radiologists used an adjusted decision rule on Bp-MRI-assessed PI-RADS 3 lesions by determining early enhancement of DCE. Pathologies at biopsy and/or prostatectomy specimens were used as standard references.  Statistical tests:   Performance was assessed using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. Kappa statistics were used to assess interobserver variability.  Results:   Interreader agreement was excellent for all three MRI assessments (all κ values >0.80). Op-MRI had comparable sensitivity (senior/junior: 90.9% [261/287] / 91.6% [263/287]) and higher specificity (78.1% [274/351] /74.4% [261/351]) compared with Mp-MRI (sensitivity: 92.3% [265/287] / 93.7% [269/287]; specificity: 67.8% [238/351] / 68.1% [239/351]) and Bp-MRI (sensitivity: 91.6% [263/287] / 93.4% [268/287]; specificity: 71.2% [250/351] / 70.1% [246/351]) for the diagnosis of CSPC.

Protein phosphorylation in EVs is of great importance for understanding intercellular signaling processes. However, the study of EV phosphoproteomics is impeded by their relatively low amount in limited clinical sample volumes, and it is necessary to have a sensitive and efficient enrichment method for EV phosphopeptides. Herein, a novel Ti(IV)-functionalized and glass fiber-supported hybrid monolithic spin tip, termed PhosTip, was prepared for enriching phosphopeptides from urinary EVs. Glass fiber as the stationary phase positions the hybrid monolith in a standard pipet tip and prevents the monolith from distortion during experiments. The preparation procedure for the new PhosTip is simple and time-saving. The hybrid monolithic PhosTip provides excellent enrichment efficiency of low-abundance phosphopeptides from cell digests and urinary EVs with minimum contamination and sample loss. Using the PhosTip, we demonstrate that 5373 and 336 unique phosphopeptides were identified from 100 and 1 μg of cell lysates, while 3919 and 217 unique phosphopeptides were successfully identified from 10 and 1 mL of urinary samples, respectively. The PhosTip was finally applied to enrich phosphopeptides in urine EVs from prostate cancer patients and healthy controls and quantify 118 up-regulated proteins with phosphosites in prostate cancer samples. These results demonstrated that the PhosTip could be a simple and convenient tool for enriching phosphopeptides from clinical samples and for broader applications in biomarker discovery.""","""['Haiyang Zhang', 'Yuanyuan Deng', 'Xinyi Liu', 'Jie Sun', 'Leyao Ma', 'Yajie Ding', 'Zhen Zhan', 'Hao Zhang', 'Yuchen Yang', 'Yanhong Gu', 'Anton B Iliuk', 'Chenxi Yang', 'W Andy Tao']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Anal Chem""","""['Synergistically Bifunctional Paramagnetic Separation Enables Efficient Isolation of Urine Extracellular Vesicles and Downstream Phosphoproteomic Analysis.', 'Preparation of Polypropylene Spin Tips Filled with Immobilized Titanium(IV) Ion Monolithic Adsorbent for Robust Phosphoproteome Analysis.', 'Titanium(IV) immobilized affinity chromatography facilitated phosphoproteomics analysis of salivary extracellular vesicles for lung cancer.', 'Clinical Application of Human Urinary Extracellular Vesicles in Kidney and Urologic Diseases.', 'Extracellular vesicles for liquid biopsy in prostate cancer: where are we and where are we headed?', 'Macroporous Epoxy-Based Monoliths Functionalized with Anti-CD63 Nanobodies for Effective Isolation of Extracellular Vesicles in Urine.', 'Extracellular vesicle proteomics and phosphoproteomics identify pathways for increased risk in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 and type 2 diabetes mellitus.']"""

Whether this improved diagnostic accuracy translates into improved outcome after radical prostatectomy (RPE) has not yet been shown. Therefore, the aim of this study was to compare the oncological outcome after RPE between patients that underwent preoperative staging with CI or PSMA-PET for intermediate and high-risk PCa.  Methods:   We retrospectively selected all patients that underwent RPE for intermediate- or high-risk PCa at our institution before PSMA-PET introduction (between March 2014 and September 2016) and compared the oncologic outcome of patients staged with PSMA-PET (between October 2016 and October 2018). Oncological pre-surgical risk parameters (age, PSA, D'Amico score, biopsy-ISUP, and cT stage) were compared between the groups. Oncological outcome was determined as PSA persistence, nerve-sparing rate, and surgical margin status. Wilcoxon rank-sum, Fisher's, and chi-square tests where used for statistical testing.  Results:   One hundred five patients were included, 53 in the CI group and 52 in the PSMA-group. Patients in the PSMA group had higher ISUP grade (p < 0.001) and D'Amico score (p < 0.05). The rate of free surgical margins and PSA persistence after RPE was 64% and 17% for the CI and 77% and 6% for the PSMA group (p = 0.15 and 0.13, respectively). Subgroup analysis with high-risk patients revealed PSA persistence in 7% (3/44) in the PSMA group and 25% (7/28) in the CI group (p = 0.04). Limitations include the retrospective design and choline-PET for some patients in the CI group.  Conclusion:   Immediate outcome after RPE was not worse in the PSMA group compared with the CI group, despite a higher-risk cohort. In a comparison of only high-risk patients, PSMA-PET staging was associated with a significantly lower rate of postsurgical PSA persistence.""","""['Daniela A Ferraro#', 'Fabienne Lehner#', 'Anton S Becker', 'Benedikt Kranzbühler', 'Ken Kudura', 'Iliana Mebert', 'Michael Messerli', 'Thomas Hermanns', 'Daniel Eberli#', 'Irene A Burger#']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Eur J Nucl Med Mol Imaging""","""['68Ga-PSMA PET/CT for Primary Lymph Node and Distant Metastasis NM Staging of High-Risk Prostate Cancer.', 'More advantages in detecting bone and soft tissue metastases from prostate cancer using 18F-PSMA PET/CT.', '68Ga-Labeled Prostate-specific Membrane Antigen Ligand Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography for Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.', 'PET/CT With 68Ga-PSMA in Prostate Cancer: Radiopharmaceutical Background and Clinical Implications.', 'Use of gallium-68 prostate-specific membrane antigen positron-emission tomography for detecting lymph node metastases in primary and recurrent prostate cancer and location of recurrence after radical prostatectomy: an overview of the current literature.', 'The Performance of FDA-Approved PET Imaging Agents in the Detection of Prostate Cancer.', 'The Role of 18FF-Choline PET/CT in the Initial Management and Outcome Prediction of Prostate Cancer: A Real-World Experience from a Multidisciplinary Approach.', 'Quantitative imaging parameters to predict the local staging of prostate cancer in intermediate- to high-risk patients.']"""

Survey data of 75 institutions between August 2019 and October 2019 were collected. The imaging modalities used were dependent on resources available to the institutions. The displacement of a brachytherapy applicator results in significant dosimetric impact. It is essential to verify applicator placements using imaging modalities before treatment. Various imaging modalities used in institutions included a computed tomography (CT) scanner, an angiography X-ray system, a multi-purpose X-ray system and a radiotherapy simulator. The median total exposure time in overall treatment sessions was $\le$75 s for gynecological and prostate cancers. Some institutions used fluoroscopy to monitor the brachytherapy source movement. Institutional countermeasures for reducing unwanted imaging dose included minimizing the image area, changing the imaging orientation, reducing the imaging frequency and optimizing the imaging conditions. It is worth noting that half of the institutions did not confirm imaging dose regularly. This study reported on the usage of imaging modalities for brachytherapy in Japan. More caution should be applied with interstitial brachytherapy with many catheters that can lead to potentially substantial increments in imaging doses for monitoring the actual brachytherapy source using fluoroscopy.

Bone Health Agents (BHA), i.e. RANK ligand inhibitor (Denosumab) and bisphosphonate such as zoledronic acid, are indicated to prevent SREs without a clear survival benefit. SREs on patient health have a high impact and it is, therefore, important to consider the role of new therapies with BHA to better understand the involvement of combination therapy. The primary aim of this multicentric study is to assess OS in mCRPC patients treated with Radium-223 in combination with BHA.  Materials and methods:   430 consecutive patients treated with Radium-223 alone or in combination with BHA, affected by mCRPC, from January 2015 to July 2019 in six Italian Nuclear Medicine Units, were included. Furthermore, data were collected at baseline, after every Radium-223 administration, and during follow-up, at 3 and 6 months and 1 year after the 6th cycle. Clinical data have been evaluated before starting treatment with Radium-223 and at the end of treatment and/or at progression. Patients who received target bone therapy with BHA before Radium-223 treatment together with patients who did not receive this therapy at all (NO BHA GROUP), were compared to patients treated with concomitant Radium-223 and BHA (BHA GROUP).  Results:   In univariate models (p < .05) several clinical aspects have an impact on OS: concomitant BHA (p = .018), BMI (p .001), ECOG PS (p = .000), Baseline Hb (p = .000), Baseline PSA (p = .000), Baseline tALP (p = .000), Baseline LDH (p = .000), and Baseline neutrophils (p = .009). Baseline Hb, Baseline tALP, and Baseline LDH have been confirmed as statistically significant parameters in multivariate models. Indeed, concomitant BHA has not a significant impact on OS (p = .244) in multivariate models.  Conclusions:   At univariate analysis, our data showed that NO BHA GROUP and BHA GROUP differ in OS by 7 months (95%CI: (1-16.4), p = .02). This is not confirmed at multivariate analysis where after adjusting for other baseline factors, BHA is not significant anymore. This is clearly explained as bias by indication: patients with the same levels of tALP, Hb, and LDH receiving or not receiving BHA are expected to have a similar survival.

We aimed to externally validate the SCaP (Severance Study Group of Prostate Cancer) Survival Calculator that incorporates a long short-term memory artificial neural network (ANN) model to estimate survival outcomes of PCa according to initial treatment modality.  Materials and methods:   The validation cohort consisted of clinicopathological data of 4,415 patients diagnosed with biopsy-proven PCa between April 2005 and November 2018 at three institutions. Area under the curves (AUCs) and time-to-event calibration plots were utilized to determine the predictive accuracies of the SCaP Survival Calculator in terms of progression to castration-resistant PCa (CRPC)-free survival, cancer-specific survival (CSS), and overall survival (OS).  Results:   Excellent discrimination was observed for CRPC-free survival, CSS, and OS outcomes, with AUCs of 0.962, 0.944, and 0.884 for 5-year outcomes and 0.959, 0.928, and 0.854 for 10-year outcomes, respectively. The AUC values were higher for all survival endpoints compared to those of the development cohort. Calibration plots showed that predicted probabilities of 5-year survival endpoints had concordance comparable to those of the observed frequencies. However, calibration performances declined for 10-year predictions with an overall underestimation.  Conclusion:   The SCaP Survival Calculator is a reliable and useful tool for determining the optimal initial treatment modality and for guiding survival predictions for patients with newly diagnosed PCa.

Methods:   A convolutional deep-Q network was employed to control the dose rate and multileaf collimator of a C-arm linear accelerator model using the current dose distribution and machine parameter state as input. A Q-value was defined as the discounted cumulative cost based on dose objectives, and experience-replay RL was performed to determine a policy to minimize the Q-value. A two-dimensional network design was employed which optimized each opposing leaf pair independently while monitoring the corresponding dose plane blocked by those leaves. This RL approach was applied to CT and contours from 40 retrospective prostate cancer patients. The dataset was split into training (15 patients) and validation (5 patients) groups to optimize the network, and its performance was tested in an independent cohort of 20 patients by comparing RL-based dose distributions to conformal arcs and clinical intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) delivering a prescription dose of 78 Gy in 40 fractions.  Results:   Mean ± SD execution time of the RL VMAT optimization was 1.5 ± 0.2 s per slice. In the test cohort, mean ± SD (P-value) planning target volume (PTV), bladder, and rectum dose were 80.5 ± 2.0 Gy (P < 0.001), 44.2 ± 14.6 Gy (P < 0.001), and 43.7 ± 11.1 Gy (P < 0.001) for RL VMAT compared to 81.6 ± 1.1 Gy, 51.6 ± 12.9 Gy, and 36.0 ± 12.3 Gy for clinical IMRT.  Conclusions:   RL was applied to VMAT MPO using clinical patient contours without independently optimized treatment plans for training and achieved comparable target and normal tissue dose to clinical plans despite the application of a relatively simple network design originally developed for video-game control.

Development of bone metastasis requires cancer cells to successfully complete a number of challenging steps, including local invasion and intravasation, survival in circulation, extravasation and initial seeding, and finally, formation of metastatic colonies after a period of dormancy or indolent growth. During this process, cancer cells often undergo a series of cellular and molecular changes to gain cellular plasticity that helps them adapt to various environments they encounter along the journey of metastasis. Understanding the mechanisms behind cellular plasticity and adaptation during the formation of bone metastasis is crucial for the development of novel therapies.""","""['Cao Fang', 'Yibin Kang']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Bone""","""['Epithelial plasticity, cancer stem cells and bone metastasis formation.', 'Epithelial-mesenchymal plasticity in carcinoma metastasis.', 'Phenotypic plasticity during metastatic colonization.', 'Bone Metastasis: Molecular Mechanisms Implicated in Tumour Cell Dormancy in Breast and Prostate Cancer.', 'miR-154* and miR-379 in the DLK1-DIO3 microRNA mega-cluster regulate epithelial to mesenchymal transition and bone metastasis of prostate cancer.', 'How circulating tumor cluster biology contributes to the metastatic cascade: from invasion to dissemination and dormancy.', 'Stromal Co-Cultivation for Modeling Breast Cancer Dormancy in the Bone Marrow.']"""

At the cellular level, testosterone activates both the genomic signaling pathway, through the intracellular androgen receptor (AR), and membrane-initiated androgen signaling (MIAS), by plasma membrane receptors. We have previously shown that the activation of MIAS induces uncontrolled proliferation and fails to stimulate the beneficial immunomodulatory effects of testosterone in prostatic cells, becoming necessary to investigate if genomic signaling mediates homeostatic effects of testosterone. However, the lack of specific modulators for genomic androgen signaling has delayed the understanding of this mechanism. In this article, we demonstrate that monosialoganglioside (GM1) micelles are capable of delivering testosterone into the cytoplasm to specifically activate genomic signaling. Stimulation with testosterone-loaded GM1 micelles led to the activation of androgen response element (ARE)-regulated genes in vitro as well as to the recovery of normal prostate size and histology after castration in mice. In addition, these micelles avoided MIAS, as demonstrated by the absence of rapid signaling pathway activation and the inability to induce uncontrolled cell proliferation. In conclusion, our results validate a novel tool for the specific activation of genomic androgen signaling and demonstrate the importance of selective pathway activation in androgen-mediated proliferation.""","""['Nahuel Peinetti', 'Mariana Micaela Cuello Rubio', 'Liliana Del Valle Sosa', 'María Victoria Scalerandi', 'Roxana Valeria Alasino', 'Victoria Peyret', 'Juan Pablo Nicola', 'Dante Miguel Beltramo', 'Amado Alfredo Quintar', 'Cristina Alicia Maldonado']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Int J Pharm""","""['Platelet-Synthesized Testosterone in Men with Prostate Cancer Induces Androgen Receptor Signaling.', 'Activation of GPR56, a novel adhesion GPCR, is necessary for nuclear androgen receptor signaling in prostate cells.', 'Activation of two mutant androgen receptors from human prostatic carcinoma by adrenal androgens and metabolic derivatives of testosterone.', 'Key targets of hormonal treatment of prostate cancer.

The antibody selectively delivers IR700 to cancer cells, which can then be killed after photoexcitation. Glypican-1 (GPC-1) is a novel target expressed specifically in malignant tumors. We aimed to investigate whether anti-GPC-1 antibody Miltuximab® (Glytherix Ltd., Sydney, Australia) can be conjugated with IR700 for PIT of solid tumors.  Methods:   The dye IR700 was conjugated with Miltuximab® and characterized by spectrophotometry and flow cytometry. Miltuximab®-IR700-mediated PIT was tested in prostate (DU-145), bladder (C3 and T-24), brain (U-87 and U-251) and ovarian (SKOV-3) cancer cell lines. After 1 h incubation with Miltuximab®-IR700, the cells were washed by PBS and illuminated using a 690-nm light-emitting diode. The viability of the cells was assessed by a CCK-8 viability kit 24 h later.  Results:   Miltuximab®-IR700-mediated PIT caused 67.3-92.3% reduction in viability of cells with medium-high GPC-1 expression and did not affect the viability of GPC-1-low cells. Cytotoxicity was attributed to the targeted binding of the conjugate with subsequent photoactivation, as the conjugate or light exposure alone had no effect on the cell viability. Miltuximab®-IR700 did not induce cytotoxicity in cells blocked by unconjugated Miltuximab®.  Conclusions:   PIT with Miltuximab®-IR700 appears to be highly specific and effective against GPC-1-expressing cancer cells, indicating that it holds promise for an effective and safe treatment of early stage solid tumors or as adjuvant therapy following surgical resection. These findings necessitate further investigation of PIT with Miltuximab®-IR700 in other GPC-1-expressing cancer cell lines in vitro and in vivo in xenograft tumor models.""","""['Dmitry M Polikarpov', 'Douglas H Campbell', 'Maria E Lund', 'Yanling Lu', 'Yiqing Lu', 'Jiehua Wu', 'Bradley J Walsh', 'Andrei V Zvyagin', 'David A Gillatt']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Photodiagnosis Photodyn Ther""","""['Near-infrared photoimmunotherapy with galactosyl serum albumin in a model of diffuse peritoneal disseminated ovarian cancer.', 'Near-Infrared Photochemoimmunotherapy by Photoactivatable Bifunctional Antibody-Drug Conjugates Targeting Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2 Positive Cancer.', 'Phototoxicity in near-infrared photoimmunotherapy is influenced by the subcellular localization of antibody-IR700.', 'Near-Infrared Photoimmunotherapy of Cancer.', 'The chemical basis of cytotoxicity of silicon-phthalocyanine-based near infrared photoimmunotherapy (NIR-PIT) and its implications for treatment monitoring.', 'Near Infrared Photoimmunotherapy: A Review of Recent Progress and Their Target Molecules for Cancer Therapy.', 'Near-infrared photoimmunotherapy: design and potential applications for cancer treatment and beyond.', 'Near-Infrared Photoimmunotherapy (NIR-PIT) in Urologic Cancers.', 'Role of glypican-1 in regulating multiple cellular signaling pathways.']"""

We investigated outcomes after single-fraction (SF) stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) in patients with oligometastatic disease.  Methods and materials:   Between February 2010 and June 2019, patients who received SF SBRT to 1 to 5 sites of oligometastatic disease were included in this retrospective study. The primary objective was to describe patterns of first failure after SBRT. Secondary objectives included overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), high-grade treatment-related toxicity (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events grade ≥3), and freedom from systemic therapy (FFST).  Results:   In total, 371 patients with 494 extracranial oligometastases received SF SBRT ranging from 16 Gy to 28 Gy. The most common primary malignancies were prostate (n = 107), lung (n = 63), kidney (n = 52), gastrointestinal (n = 51), and breast cancers (n = 42). The median follow-up was 3.1 years. The 1-, 3-, and 5-year OS was 93%, 69%, and 55%, respectively; PFS was 48%, 19%, and 14%, respectively; and FFST was 70%, 43%, and 35%, respectively. Twelve patients (3%) developed grade 3 to 4 treatment-related toxicity, with no grade 5 toxicity. As the first site of failure, the cumulative incidence of local failure (irrespective of other failures) at 1, 3 and 5 years was 4%, 8%, and 8%, respectively; locoregional relapse at the primary was 10%, 18%, and 18%, respectively; and distant failure was 45%, 66%, and 70%, respectively.  Conclusions:   SF SBRT is safe and effective, and a significant proportion of patients remain FFST for several years after therapy.

Nevertheless, some patients lack confidence in or access to AS. Focal therapy (FT) is a possible alternative to radical treatment for such patients.  Objective:   We evaluated dominant tumor (DT) progression across serial biopsies to determine whether men on AS could be reasonable candidates for FT.  Design, setting, and participants:   Men enrolled in AS at University of California, San Francisco between 1996 and 2017 with low/intermediate risk were included.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Changes in biopsy grade, volume, and focality of the DT over time were assessed. Focality (good or poor for FT) was defined by the number of cores, laterality, and contiguity of prostate sites containing tumor (based on pathology reports). Candidates (either for targeted/quadrant ablation or for hemigland ablation) were defined based on good focality, grade group (GG) ≤2, and low-volume disease. Patients were classified as favorable (GG ≤ 2 with good focality and concordant multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging [mpMRI]) or unfavorable (poor focality or high-volume disease or discordant mpMRI) for FT at surveillance biopsies.  Results and limitations:   A total of 1057 men met the inclusion criteria. The median number of biopsies per patient was three (interquartile range 2-4), and 196 patients (18.5%) underwent five or more biopsies. At confirmatory biopsy, 43% remained candidates for FT (67% for targeted/quadrant ablation and 33% for hemigland ablation) and 20% had a negative biopsy. Of the candidates for FT at initial biopsy, 11% had less favorable characteristics at confirmatory biopsy. Among candidates for FT based on both initial and confirmatory biopsies, 70% remained favorable for hemigland ablation at subsequent biopsies. Limitations include retrospective design and mpMRI information only at surveillance biopsy.  Conclusions:   Serial biopsy findings in men with early-stage cancer on AS show that tumor location remains relatively stable and significant changes in grade and/or volume occur largely in the DT. Combined diagnostic and confirmatory biopsy findings help better select patients for FT than the use of the diagnostic biopsy alone.  Patient summary:   In a large cohort of patients on active surveillance for prostate cancer, we evaluated changes across serial biopsies to identify potential candidates for focal therapy (FT). Our findings showed that the dominant tumor remained stable over time and the majority of men were favorable candidates for FT.""","""['Vittorio Fasulo', 'Janet E Cowan', 'Martina Maggi', 'Samuel L Washington rd', 'Hao G Nguyen', 'Katsuto Shinohara', 'Massimo Lazzeri', 'Paolo Casale', 'Peter R Carroll']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Eur Urol Oncol""","""['Outcomes of Serial Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Subsequent Biopsy in Men with Low-risk Prostate Cancer Managed with Active Surveillance.', 'Predictors of pathologic progression on biopsy among men on active surveillance for localized prostate cancer: the value of the pattern of surveillance biopsies.', 'Selecting Patients with Favorable Risk, Grade Group 2 Prostate Cancer for Active Surveillance-Does Magnetic Resonance Imaging Have a Role?', 'The role of MRI in active surveillance for men with localized prostate cancer.', 'Risk of adverse pathology at prostatectomy in the era of MRI and targeted biopsies; rethinking active surveillance for intermediate risk prostate cancer patients.', 'Effect of Focal vs Extended Irreversible Electroporation for the Ablation of Localized Low- or Intermediate-Risk Prostate Cancer on Early Oncological Control: A Randomized Clinical Trial.', 'Radiomics in prostate cancer: an up-to-date review.', 'Racial differences in circulating mitochondria-derived peptides may contribute to prostate cancer health disparities.']"""

The search for alternative diagnostic techniques is still ongoing.  Objective:   To determine the accuracy of microultrasound (microUS) for the diagnosis of csPCa within prospectively collected cohort of patients with a suspicion of prostate cancer (PCa) according to MRI.  Design, setting, and participants:   A total of 320 consecutive patients with at least one Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PIRADS) ≥3 lesion according to MRI were prospectively enrolled.  Intervention:   All patients received microUS before prostate biopsy using the ExactVu system; the Prostate Risk Identification using microUS (PRI-MUS) protocol was used to identify targets. The urologists were blinded to MRI results until after the microUS targeting was completed. All patients received both targeted (based on either microUS or MRI findings) and randomized biopsies.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   The sensitivity and specificity of microUS to determine the presence of csPCa (defined as at least one core with a Gleason score ≥7 PCa) were determined. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was fitted to determine the predictors of csPCa.  Results and limitations:   Clinically significant PCa was diagnosed in 116 (36.3%) patients. The sensitivity and negative predictive value of microUS for csPCa diagnosis were 89.7% and 81.5%, while specificity and positive predictive value were 26.0% and 40.8%, respectively. A combination of microUS-targeted and randomized biopsies would allow diagnosing the same proportion of csPCa as that diagnosed by an approach combining MRI-targeted and randomized biopsies (n = 113; 97.4%), with only three (2.6%) csPCa cases diagnosed by a microUS-targeted and three (2.6%) by an MRI-targeted approach. In a logistic regression model, an increasing PRI-MUS score was an independent predictor of csPCa (p ≤ 0.005). The main limitation of the current study is represented by the fact that all patients had suspicious MRI.  Conclusions:   Microultrasound is a promising imaging modality for targeted prostate biopsies. Our results suggest that a microUS-based biopsy strategy may be capable of diagnosing the great majority of cancers, while missing only few patients with csPCa.  Patient summary:   According to our results, microultrasound (microUS) may represent an effective diagnostic alternative to magnetic resonance imaging for the diagnosis of clinically significant prostate cancer, providing high sensitivity and a high negative predictive value.

A recent example of a cancer atlas is the Australian cancer atlas (ACA), that provides interactive maps to visualise spatially smoothed estimates of cancer incidence and survival for 20 different cancer types over 2148 small areas across Australia.  Methods:   The present study proposes a multivariate Bayesian meta-analysis model, which can model multiple cancers jointly using summary measures without requiring access to the unit record data. This new approach is illustrated by modelling the publicly available spatially smoothed standardised incidence ratios for multiple cancers in the ACA divided into three groups: common, rare/less common and smoking-related. The multivariate Bayesian meta-analysis models are fitted to each group in order to explore any possible association between the cancers in three remoteness regions: major cities, regional and remote areas across Australia. The correlation between the pairs of cancers included in each multivariate model for a group was examined by computing the posterior correlation matrix for each cancer group in each region. The posterior correlation matrices in different remoteness regions were compared using Jennrich's test of equality of correlation matrices (Jennrich in J Am Stat Assoc. 1970;65(330):904-12. https://doi.org/10.1080/01621459.1970.10481133 ).  Results:   Substantive correlation was observed among some cancer types. There was evidence that the magnitude of this correlation varied according to remoteness of a region. For example, there has been significant negative correlation between prostate and lung cancer in major cities, but zero correlation found in regional and remote areas for the same pair of cancer types.

One AR isoform, the AR-V7 splice variant, is a constitutively active transcription factor which lacks a ligand binding domain and is therefore undruggable. AR-V7 expression correlates with resistance to androgen receptor signaling inhibitors (ARSi) and poor clinical prognoses. The occurrence of the AR-V7 splice variant is driven by alternative splicing of AR pre-mRNA by the spliceosome, however the mechanistic details are poorly understood. We demonstrate that the splicing factor RBM39 is critical for alternative splicing of the AR-V7 splice variant mRNA transcripts from AR pre-mRNA, and that the anti-cancer drug, indisulam, reduces AR-V7 mRNA levels by degrading RBM39.

We carried out a secondary analysis of a randomized controlled study to determine whether the risk of RT-related late toxicities in patients with prostate cancer varies depending on the treating radiation oncologist.  Methods and materials:   This is a secondary analysis of a phase 3 randomized controlled study in which patients with prostate cancer with Gleason score ≤7, clinical stage T1b-T3a, and prostate-specific antigen <30 ng/mL were randomized to receive androgen suppression for 6 months, starting either 4 months before or concurrently with definitive prostate radiation therapy. Incidence of late RT-related toxicity was estimated using Kaplan-Meier methods. We applied multivariable semiparametric shared frailty models with gamma distribution to determine the between-physician variation in the hazard of late RT-related grade ≥3 gastrointestinal, genitourinary, or overall toxicity. Patient level covariables included age, risk group, year of enrollment, and treatment regimen. Frailty variance, a measure of unexplained heterogeneity, was estimated with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Statistical significance was suggested when the lower limit of the 95% CI for the frailty variance was >0. The Commenges-Andersen test was used for P value estimation.  Results:   Overall, 426 patients were treated by 9 radiation oncologists. On log-rank test, there was a significant difference in the cumulative incidence of overall grade ≥3 toxicities (P = .001) and grade ≥3 gastrointestinal toxicity (P = .01) among the physician-based clusters. The frailty variance for overall late grade ≥3 toxicity was 0.31 (95% CI, 0.02-1.39; P = .01). The frailty variance for the grade ≥3 gastrointestinal and genitourinary toxicity was 0.84 (95% CI, 0.00-4.20; P = .11) and 0.11 (95% CI, 0.00-1.13; P = .31), respectively.  Conclusions:   In our study, the hazard of overall RT-related late grade ≥3 toxicity varied significantly depending on treating radiation oncologist.

Methods and materials:   Patients with painful (≥2 points on a 0-to-10 scale) nonspine bone metastases from a solid tumor were enrolled. The prescribed dose was 35 Gy in 5 fractions. The primary endpoint was overall pain response rate (complete response [CR] and partial response [PR]) as measured per the International Consensus on Palliative Radiotherapy Endpoints guideline 6 months after SBRT.  Results:   Forty-one osseous lesions in 38 patients were registered between June 2018 and June 2019. All lesions satisfied the inclusion criteria, and the patients completed the protocol treatment. Patients most commonly had lung cancer (22%), followed by prostate cancer, uterus cancer, and renal cell carcinoma (15%, 15%, and 12%, respectively). Bone metastases were most commonly located in coxal bones (56%). The median duration of follow-up after registration was 8 months (range, 1-19 months). Among evaluable lesions at 3 and 6 months after SBRT, the 3- and 6-month pain response rates were 78% and 75%, respectively. The local control rate at 6 months was 92%. Seven patients (17%) experienced bone fracture after irradiation, and 3 patients (7%) experienced grade 2 limb edema. One patient had regrowth of coxal bone metastases, and the tumor penetrated the sigmoid colon. Soft tissue abscess around the tumor and osteonecrosis of coxal bones were confirmed. The patient died of infection 4 months after SBRT and was determined to be a possible treatment-related death.  Conclusions:   This prospective clinical trial showed that SBRT for nonspine bone metastases was effective in terms of pain palliation. These findings warrant a larger randomized controlled trial to compare SBRT with conventional radiation therapy.

The purpose of this study was to assess regional antibiotic prophylaxis (ABP) compliance with national guidelines.  Material and methods:   In 2015, 26 healthcare facilities, both public and private, were requested to audit five items: utilization of antibiotic prophylaxis, the antimicrobial agent (the molecule) administered, time between injection and incision, initial dose, number of intraoperative and postoperative additional doses. Seven surgical procedures were selected for assessment: appendicectomy (APP), cataract (CAT), cesarean section (CES), colorectal cancer surgery (CCR), hysterectomy (HYS), total hip arthroplasty (THA) and transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP). A statistical analysis of the 2303 records included was carried out.  Results:   The general rate of antibiotic prophylaxis compliance was 64%. The antimicrobial agent used and initial dose were in compliance with the guidelines for 93% and 97.4% of cases respectively, and administration of antibiotic prophylaxis was achieved 60minutes before incision in 77.6% of the records included. Regarding gastrointestinal surgery, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid was used in 32% of patients. In 26% of appendectomy files, administration occurred after incision, and one out of two files showed non-complaint perioperative and postoperative consumption.  Conclusion:   Compliance with nationwide ABP guidelines is in need of pronounced improvement, especially with regard to time interval between injection and incision and the molecule prescribed.

Perfluoroalkyl chemicals (PFCs) are endocrine disrupting chemicals affecting estrogen homeostasis.  Objectives:   We examined the association between PFCs and a group of estrogen related cancers and explored if increased non-occupational exposure was associated with increased odds of developing these cancers. We also explored which of these chemical exposures was more correlated with each cancer.  Methods:   Using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), we selected participants ≥ 20 years of age. Our outcome variable was presence or absence of breast, prostate, ovarian and uterine cancer (yes/no); our exposure variables were serum PFCs. Logistic regression models were used in investigating the association between PFCs and cancer types and between quartiles of PFCs exposure concentrations and presence or absence of cancer while adjusting for covariates. Discriminant analysis was used to assess the correlation between individual PFCs compounds and individual cancer types.  Results:   PFCs were associated with increased odds of ovarian cancer; PFOA: 1.02(1.01, 1.02), PFOS: 1.01 (1.012, 1.013), PFHS 1.031 (1.030, 1.033), PFDE: 1.29(1.27, 1.30) and increased odds of breast cancer; PFOA: 1.089(1.089, 1.09), PFOS: 1.011(1.011, 1.011), PFNA: 1.031(1.030, 1.033), PFHS: 1.02 (1.02, 1.02), PFDE: 1.19(1.18, 1.19). PFCs were not associated with increased odds of prostate or uterine cancers. Comparing the odds in quartile 4 to quartile 1 for ovarian cancer, PFOA: 1.77(1.75,1.79), PFOS: 2.25(2.22, 2.28), PFHS: 1.86(1.84, 1.88), PFDE: 2.11(2.09, 2.14).

However, the panoramic picture of pepsinogen gene family in human cancer is not clear. This study focused on elucidating the expression profile, activated pathway, immune cells infiltration, mutation, and copy number variation of PGs and their potential role in human cancer.  Method:   Based on the next generation sequence data from TCGA, Oncomine, and CCLE, the molecular changes and clinical correlation of PGs in 33 tumor types were analyzed systematically by R language, including the expression, mutation, and copy number variation of PGs and their correlation with cancer-related signal transduction pathway, immune cell infiltration, and prognostic potential in different cancers.  Results:   PGs expression profiles appear different in 33 tumors. The transcriptional expression of PGs was detected in 16 of all 33 tumors. PGC was highly expressed in cholangiocarcinoma, colon adenocarcinoma, rectum adenocarcinoma, uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma, bladder urothelial carcinoma and breast cancer, while decreased in stomach adenocarcinoma, kidney renal clear cell carcinoma, prostate adenocarcinoma, lung squamous cell carcinoma, and esophageal carcinoma. PGA3, PGA4, and PGA5 were expressed in most normal tissues, but decreased in cancer tissues. PGs expression was significantly related to the activation or inhibition of many signal transduction pathways, in which PGC and PGA5 are more likely to be associated with cancer-related pathways. PGC participated in 33 regulatory network pathways in pan-cancer, mainly distributed in stomach adenocarcinoma, esophageal carcinoma, and lung squamous cell carcinoma, respectively. PGC and PGA3 expression were significantly correlated with immune cell infiltration. The results of survival analysis showed that different PGs expression play significantly different prognostic roles in different cancers. PGC was correlated with poor survival in brain lower grade glioma, skin cutaneous melanoma, and higher survival in kidney renal clear cell carcinoma, acute myeloid leukemia, mesothelioma, and uveal melanoma. PGA4 was only associated with higher survival in kidney renal clear cell carcinoma. Genetic variation analysis showed that PGC gene often mutated in uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma and stomach adenocarcinoma had extensive copy number amplification in various tumor types. PGC expression was upregulated with the increase of copy number in cholangiocarcinoma, esophageal carcinoma, and kidney renal papillary cell carcinoma, while in stomach adenocarcinoma, PGC was upregulated regardless of whether the copy number was increased or decreased.  Conclusions:   PGs was expressed unevenly in a variety of cancer tissues and was related to many carcinogenic pathways and involved in the immune regulation. PGC participated in 33 regulatory pathways in human cancer. Different PGs expression play significantly different prognostic roles in different cancers. The variation of copy number of PGC gene could affect the PGC expression. These findings suggested that PGs, especially PGC have characteristic of broad-spectrum expression in multiple cancers rather than being confined to the gastric mucosa, which may made PGs be useful biomarkers for prediction/diagnosis/prognosis and effective targets for treatment in human cancer.""","""['Shixuan Shen', 'Hao Li', 'Jingwei Liu', 'Liping Sun', 'Yuan Yuan']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Cancer Med""","""['Pan-Cancer Analysis of PARP1 Alterations as Biomarkers in the Prediction of Immunotherapeutic Effects and the Association of Its Expression Levels and Immunotherapy Signatures.', 'Identification of SHCBP1 as a potential biomarker involving diagnosis, prognosis, and tumor immune microenvironment across\xa0multiple\xa0cancers.', 'Advancing Pan-cancer Gene Expression Survial Analysis by Inclusion of Non-coding RNA.', 'Integrative data mining and meta-analysis to investigate the prognostic role of microRNA-200 family in various human malignant neoplasms: A consideration on heterogeneity.', 'Gene structures of pepsinogens A and C.', 'Multimolecular characteristics and role of BRCA1 interacting protein C-terminal helicase 1 (BRIP1) in human tumors: a pan-cancer analysis.', 'Single-cell characterization revealed hypoxia-induced metabolic reprogramming of gastric cancer.', 'Pan-cancer analysis of forkhead box Q1 as a potential prognostic and immunological biomarker.', 'Characterizing HDAC Pathway Copy Number Variation in Pan-Cancer.']"""

Methods:   We selected the agonist exenatide (Ex4) as the parent peptide of a GLP-1R targeting probe and prepared Cys-Ex4 by addition of an N-terminal Cys residue and labeling with the prosthetic agent N-(3-[125I]iodophenyl)maleimide ([125I]IPM) to generate [125I]Ex4ipm. We evaluated the affinity of [125I]Ex4ipm for GLP-1R, as well as cellular binding profiles in insulinoma and prostate cancer cell lines, and in vivo biodistributions in normal and tumor-bearing mice to assess GLP-1R-dependent accumulation of radioactivity in tissues.  Results:   [125I]Ex4ipm was easily synthesized with high radiochemical yield (73%), radiochemical purity (> 99%), and molar activity (81 GBq/µmol) via a thiol/maleimide reaction. Following administration to mice, [125I]Ex4ipm accumulated to high levels in the pancreas (23.3% ID/g), with radioactivity co-localizing in areas having insulin-positive β cells. High amounts of radioactivity also accumulated in insulinomas that overexpressed GLP-1R (27.5% ID/g). In contrast, low amounts of [125I]Ex4ipm accumulation, corresponding to low expression levels of GLP-1R, were observed in prostate cancer cells and xenografts used as a model of non-pancreatic applications.

When the disease becomes resistant to androgen-deprivation therapy, treatment options are sparse. To address the high medical need in castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), we generated a novel PSMAxCD3 bispecific antibody termed CC-1. CC-1 binds to prostate-specific membrane antigen that is expressed on prostate cancer cells and tumour vessels, thereby allowing a dual anticancer effect.  Methods and analysis:   This first in human clinical study is a prospective and multicentre trial which enrols patients with metastatic CRPC after failure of established third-line therapy. CC-1 is applied after prophylactic interleukin-6 receptor blockade with tocilizumab (once 8 mg/kg body weight). Each patient receives at least one cycle of CC-1 over a time course of 7 days in an inpatient setting. If clinical benefit is observed, up to five additional cycles of CC-1 can be applied. The study is divided in two parts: (1) a dose escalation phase with intraindividual dose increase from 28 µg to the target dose of 1156 µg based on a modified fast titration design by Simon et al to determine safety, tolerability and the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) as primary endpoints and (2) a dose expansion phase with additional 14 patients on the MTD level of part (1) to identify first signs of efficacy. Secondary endpoints compromise overall safety, tumour response, survival and a translational research programme with, among others, the analysis of CC-1 half-life, the induced immune response, as well as the molecular profiling in liquid biopsies.  Ethics and dissemination:   The PSMAxCD3 study was approved by the Ethics Committee of The University Hospital Tübingen (100/2019AMG1) and the Paul-Ehrlich-Institut (3684/02). Clinical trial results will be published in peer-reviewed journals.

Participants:   Men suspected with prostate cancer and referred to Urology centres in Alberta were enrolled in the APCaRI 01 study, while men with a prior prostate cancer diagnosis participated in the APCaRI 03 study from 1 July 2014 to 30 June 2019. The APCaRI Registry and Biorepository links biospecimens and data from a wide representation of patients drawn from an Alberta population of more than 4 million.  Findings to date:   From 1 July 2014 to 30 June 2019, total APCaRI 01 and 03 study recruitment was 3754 men; 142 (4%) of these men withdrew in full, 65 men (2%) withdrew biospecimens and 123 men (3%) died of any cause. Over this same time, 8677 patient-reported outcome measure (PROM) surveys and 7368 biospecimens were collected and are available from the registry and biorepository, respectively. The data entry error rate was 0.8% and 0.95% for critical and non-critical values, respectively, and 1.8% for patient-reported surveys.  Future plans:   The APCaRI Registry and Biorepository will collect longitudinal data and PROM surveys until 2024, patient outcomes up to 25 years after recruitment and biospecimen storage for up to 25 years.

It is mainly oriented to work with histology slides but also includes a significant part of modern image formats. Introducing Pathadin, the manuscript aims to improve understanding of contemporary image analysis components, resolve technophobia and misbeliefs in the computational field, simplifying pathology research work, and shifting it into a quantitative paradigm. Despite being easy to use, Pathadin includes both basic and advanced analytical algorithms, as the application of machine learning. The functionality of Pathadin is demonstrated by AI-enhanced quantification of epithelial and stromal changes in prostate carcinoma, and their dependence on ISUP grade. The material included 5 radical prostatectomy samples for training and 83 (including 11 autopsies) samples for analysis. The analytical material was stained with Masson's trichrome and Ki67, as widely available and potentially prognostic markers. An integrated solution by HistomicsTK for Ki67 evaluation was used. A U-net model for separating glands and stroma was trained, simplifying the independent analysis of these components. During the process, the model successfully highlighted glands and stroma. Masson's trichrome stain demonstrated a gradual increase in collagen expression, being statistically significant between controls vs. G1, and G3 vs. G4. Although there was considerable overlap between adjacent groups, there was only a minor overlap in collagen amount between high- and low-grade carcinomas, affirming that with further research, stroma could be an additional diagnostic marker in prostate adenocarcinoma. Ki67 showed a statistically significant gradual increase in all groups except G1 vs. G2 and G4 vs. G5.

Methods:   Eighty-five patients with 510 computed tomography (CT) images were analyzed. Median prescription dose was 40 Gy in 5 fractions. Patients were instructed to maintain a full bladder and empty rectum prior to simulation and each treatment. A single reviewer delineated organs at risk (OARs) on the simulation (Sim-CT) and Cone Beam CTs (CBCT) for analyses.  Results:   Bladder and rectum volume reductions were observed throughout the course of SBRT, with largest mean reductions of 86.9 mL (19.0%) for bladder and 6.4 mL (8.7%) for rectum noted at fraction #5 compared to Sim-CT (P < 0.01). Higher initial Sim-CT bladder volumes were predictive for greater reduction in absolute bladder volume during treatment (ρ = - 0.69; P < 0.01). Over the course of SBRT, there was a small but significant increase in bladder mean dose (+ 4.5 ± 12.8%; P < 0.01) but no significant change in the D2cc (+ 0.8 ± 4.0%; P = 0.28). The mean bladder trigone displacement was in the anterior direction (+ 4.02 ± 6.59 mm) with a corresponding decrease in mean trigone dose (- 3.6 ± 9.6%; P < 0.01) and D2cc (- 6.2 ± 15.6%; P < 0.01). There was a small but significant increase in mean rectal dose (+ 7.0 ± 12.9%, P < 0.01) but a decrease in rectal D2cc (- 2.2 ± 10.1%; P = 0.04). No significant correlations were found between relative bladder volume changes, bladder trigone displacements, or rectum volume changes with rates of genitourinary or rectal toxicities.  Conclusions:   Despite smaller than expected bladder and rectal volumes at the time of treatment compared to the planning scans, dosimetric impact was minimal and not predictive of detrimental clinical outcomes. These results cast doubt on the need for excessively strict bladder filling and rectal emptying protocols in the context of image guided prostate SBRT and prospective studies are needed to determine its necessity.""","""['David J Byun', 'Daniel J Gorovets', 'Lauren M Jacobs', 'Laura Happersett', 'Pengpeng Zhang', 'Xin Pei', 'Sarah Burleson', 'Zhigang Zhang', 'Margie Hunt', 'Sean McBride', 'Marisa A Kollmeier', 'Michael J Zelefsky']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Radiat Oncol""","""['Dosimetric impact of organ at risk daily variation during prostate stereotactic ablative radiotherapy.', 'Associations between volume changes and spatial dose metrics for the urinary bladder during local versus pelvic irradiation for prostate cancer.', 'CBCT evaluation of inter- and intra-fraction motions during prostate stereotactic body radiotherapy: a technical note.', 'Current status of intensity-modulated radiation therapy for prostate cancer: History, clinical results and future directions.', 'Effectiveness of rectal displacement devices during prostate external-beam radiation therapy: A review.', 'Stereotactic Magnetic Resonance-Guided Adaptive and Non-Adaptive Radiotherapy on Combination MR-Linear Accelerators: Current Practice and Future Directions.', 'Factors Affecting Isocenter Displacement and Planning Target Volume Margin for Patients With Rectal Cancer Receiving Radiation Therapy.', 'Bowel and Bladder Reproducibility in Image Guided Radiation Therapy for Prostate Cancer: Results of a Patterns of Practice Survey.', 'Magnetic Resonance-Guided Prostate Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy With Daily Online Plan Adaptation: Results of a Prospective Phase 1 Trial and Supplemental Cohort.', 'Are simple verbal instructions sufficient to ensure that bladder volume does not deteriorate prostate position reproducibility during spot scanning proton therapy?']"""

The implementation of its production with existing compact medical cyclotrons would mean the next essential milestone in the development of this radionuclide. While the production and application of 44Sc has been comprehensively investigated, the development of specific targetry and irradiation methods is of paramount importance. As a result, the target was optimized for the 44Ca(p,n)44Sc nuclear reaction using CaO instead of CaCO3, ensuring decrease in target radioactive degassing during irradiation and increased radionuclidic yield. Irradiations were performed at the research cyclotron at the Paul Scherrer Institute (~11 MeV, 50 µA, 90 min) and the medical cyclotron at the University of Bern (~13 MeV, 10 µA, 240 min), with yields varying from 200 MBq to 16 GBq. The development of targetry, chemical separation as well as the practical issues and implications of irradiations, are analyzed and discussed. As a proof-of-concept study, the 44Sc produced at the medical cyclotron was used for a preclinical study using a previously developed albumin-binding prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) ligand.

Previously, we reported that metformin reduced SUV39H1, a histone methyltransferase of H3 Lys9, to inhibit the migration of PCa cells. Since histone methylation is functionally linked to DNA methylation, we speculate that the knockout of the SUV39H1 gene will affect the genomic DNA methylation profile to regulate PCa cell migration and invasion. The genome-wide DNA methylation level is lower in SUV39H1 knockout (KO) cells than wild-type (WT) ones. However, the methylation levels in functional regions of CpG Islands (CGI), 5' untranslated region (UTR5), and exon regions are higher in KO cells than WT cells. Analysis of differentially methylated regions (DMRs) identified 1241 DMR genes that have differential methylation on CG sites when comparing the KO and WT samples. Gene ontology enrichment and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes Pathways analysis showed that knockout of SUV39H1 affects gene sets and pathways that are heavily involved in cell shapes, cell recognition, adhesion, motility, and migration. Our study suggests that SUV39H1 plays an important role in PCa migration via the epigenetic regulation of methylation on CG sites, and is a novel and legitimate target to inhibit PCa cell migration.""","""['Wenbo Yan', 'Yuqi Guo', 'Fangxi Xu', 'Deepak Saxena', 'Xin Li']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Genes (Basel)""","""['Aberrant histone methylation and the effect of Suv39H1 siRNA on gastric carcinoma.', 'Metformin inhibits SUV39H1-mediated migration of prostate cancer cells.', 'Identification of novel DNA-methylated genes that correlate with human prostate cancer and high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia.', 'Histone lysine methyltransferase SUV39H1 is a potent target for epigenetic therapy of hepatocellular carcinoma.', 'The importance of DNA methylation in prostate cancer development.', 'Research Progress of Role and Mechanism of SETD7 in Tumor Occurrence \u2029and Progression.', 'LncRNA HOTAIR promotes the proliferation and invasion/metastasis of breast cancer cells by targeting the miR-130a-3p/Suv39H1 axis.']"""

Hence, the interest to verify the adequacy of the delivered dose.  Material and methods:   For twenty PC patients treated by 35 Gy (Dp) in five fractions, daily pre- and post- delivery MRi scans were respectively used for adapt-to-shape (ATS) optimization, and re-computation of the delivered irradiation (Drec). Two expansion recipes, from Clinical (CTV) to Planning target volume (PTV), which slightly differed in the posterior margin were used for groups I and II, of ten patients each. Plans had to assure D95% ≥ 95%Dp to PTV, and D1cc ≤ Dp to rectum, bladder, penile bulb, and urethral planning-risk-volume (urethral-PRV). The adequacy of the delivered dose was estimated by inter-fraction average (ifa) of dose-volume metrics computed from Drec. A cumulative dose (Dsum) was calculated from the five daily Drec deformed onto the simulation MRi.  Results:   For each patient, CTV coverage resulted in D95% > 95%Dp when estimated as ifa by Drec. No significant difference for D95% and D99% metrics to CTV resulted between groups I and II. D1cc was < Dp for rectum, urethral-PRV, and penile bulb, whereas < 103.5%Dp for the bladder. Significant correlations resulted between metrics computed by Dsum and as ifa by Drec, by both linear-correlation analysis, and Receiver-Operating-Characteristic curve analysis.

We investigated the sensitivity of prostate cancer (PCa) cells (LNCaP, 22Rv1, PC3, DU145, PDB and MDB) to VP-16 and the possible relationship between VP-16 activity and TOP2 expression. The activity of VP-16 was compared with that of docetaxel, enzalutamide and olaparib. The prevalence and clinical significance of TOP2 genetic and transcriptomic alterations was also explored in mCRPC.  Methods:   Cell cultures and crystal violet cell proliferation assays were performed. Specific antibodies were used in western blots analyses of cell protein extracts. Datasets were analyzed in cBioportal.  Results:   VP-16 was active in all PCa cell lines analyzed and demonstrated increased activity in PC3 and DU145 cells. VP-16 was more cytotoxic compared to the other treatments, except for LNCaP and 22Rv1, which were more sensitive to docetaxel. Maintenance of antiandrogen treatment in MDB and PDB increased sensitivity to VP-16, docetaxel and enzalutamide. TOP2A was found overexpressed in 22Rv1, DU145 and PC3, whereas TOP2B was overexpressed in 22Rv1 and PDB. In the mCRPC datasets analysis, TOP2A mRNA overexpression was associated with worse patients' prognosis, with the molecular features of neuroendocrine prostate cancer (NEPC) and with lower androgen receptor (AR) score. Patients overexpressing TOP2A mRNA were more likely to harbor RB1 loss.

Germline genetic evaluation has important implications for PCa prognosis and management, as well as implications for family members and cancer screening. Despite the importance of germline evaluation, its utilization in urologic practice is unknown.  Materials and methods:   We conducted a 32-item survey of U.S. urologists to examine knowledge of germline testing guidelines and practice patterns. It was shared through email to 6 American Urological Association sections, the Veterans Affairs Urology Mailgroup, and social media.  Results:   Among 132 total respondents from diverse practice settings across the U.S., 12% perform germline testing, 44% refer to a genetic counselor, 11% do both, and 33% do not test/refer. Only 4% had formal education in genetics. While 98% ask about PCa family history, only 76% and 52% ask about breast and ovarian cancer.

An interesting debate concerning the potential relationship between androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) and SARS-CoV-2 infection has recently been opened in the case of prostate cancer (PC), and the aim of this multi-centre cohort study was to investigate the incidence and outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostrate cancer (mCRPC).

The in vitro cytotoxicity was evaluated using MTT assay showed that, twelve compounds out of sixteen showed higher cytotoxic activities (IC50's 1.1-6.29 µM), than that of the reference standard, 5-FU (IC50 7.53 µM).

Tumours from these patients tend to lose both copies of the wild-type BRCA gene, which makes them exquisitely sensitive to platinum drugs and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors (PARPi), treatments of choice in these disease settings. Reversion secondary mutations with the capacity of restoring BRCA protein expression have been documented in the literature as bona fide mechanisms of resistance to these treatments.  Patients and methods:   We analysed published sequencing data of BRCA genes (from tumour or circulating tumour DNA) in 327 patients with tumours harbouring mutations in BRCA1 or BRCA2 (234 patients with ovarian cancer, 27 with breast cancer, 13 with pancreatic cancer, 11 with prostate cancer and 42 with a cancer of unknown origin) that progressed on platinum or PARPi treatment.  Results:   We describe 269 cases of reversion mutations in 86 patients in this cohort (26.0%). Detailed analyses of the reversion events highlight that most amino acid sequences encoded by exon 11 in BRCA1 and BRCA2 are dispensable to generate resistance to platinum or PARPi, whereas other regions are more refractory to sizeable amino acid losses. They also underline the key role of mutagenic end-joining DNA repair pathways in generating reversions, especially in those affecting BRCA2, as indicated by the significant accumulation of DNA sequence microhomologies surrounding deletions leading to reversion events.  Conclusions:   Our analyses suggest that pharmacological inhibition of DNA end-joining repair pathways could improve durability of drug treatments by preventing the acquisition of reversion mutations in BRCA genes. They also highlight potential new therapeutic opportunities when reversions result in expression of hypomorphic versions of BRCA proteins, especially with agents targeting the response to DNA replication stress.""","""['L Tobalina', 'J Armenia', 'E Irving', ""M J O'Connor"", 'J V Forment']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Ann Oncol""","""['Diverse BRCA1 and BRCA2 Reversion Mutations in Circulating Cell-Free DNA of Therapy-Resistant Breast or Ovarian Cancer.', 'ALDH1A1 Contributes to PARP Inhibitor Resistance via Enhancing DNA Repair in BRCA2-/- Ovarian Cancer Cells.', 'Reversion and non-reversion mechanisms of resistance to PARP inhibitor or platinum chemotherapy in BRCA1/2-mutant metastatic breast cancer.', 'BRCA1/2 testing: therapeutic implications for breast cancer management.', 'The biological effects and clinical implications of BRCA mutations: where do we go from here?', 'A HUWE1 defect causes PARP inhibitor resistance by modulating the BRCA1-∆11q splice variant.', 'Spectrum of Response to Platinum and PARP Inhibitors in Germline BRCA-Associated Pancreatic Cancer in the Clinical and Preclinical Setting.', 'PARP Inhibitors in Ovarian Cancer: A Review.', 'PARP Inhibitors in Breast and Ovarian Cancer.', 'Personalized Systemic Therapies in Hereditary Cancer Syndromes.']"""

Two approved formulations of leuprolide acetate, the most commonly prescribed androgen deprivation therapy in the United States, use different extended release delivery technologies: an in situ gel and microspheres. We evaluated the prevalence and impact of late dosing on testosterone suppression for gel and microsphere formulations of leuprolide acetate.  Materials and methods:   We retrospectively analyzed records of patients with prostate cancer treated with gel or microsphere delivery of leuprolide acetate. Analyses used 2 definitions of ""month,"" ""28-day"" (late dosing after day 28, 84, 112 or 168) and ""extended"" (late dosing after day 32, 97, 128 and 194).

More than 80% and 27% of injections were late for 28-day and extended month, respectively. For 28-day month late injections 10% (gel delivery) and 14% (microsphere delivery) of testosterone values were above 50 ng/dl, and 25% (gel) vs 33% (microsphere) were above 20 ng/dl. For extended month 18% (gel) vs 25% (microsphere) were above 50 ng/dl, and 34% (gel) vs 44% (microsphere) were above 20 ng/dl. Microsphere leuprolide acetate was 1.5 times more likely to have testosterone above 50/20 ng/dl vs gel. Least square mean testosterone was 34 ng/dl (gel) vs 46 ng/dl (microsphere) for 28-day month, and 48 ng/dl (gel) vs 76 ng/dl (microsphere) for extended month.

The probe exhibits a significant turn-on response upon reaction with PSA and produces strong light emission signal with an extremely high signal-to-noise ratio. Comparison of the chemiluminescence probe with an analogous fluorescence probe showed superior detection capability in terms of response time and sensitivity. In addition, the probe was able to efficiently detect and image human semen traces on fabric, even after 3 days from sample preparation.

Our research aimed to explore the underlying mechanisms of lncRNA prostate cancer-associated transcript 6 (PCAT6) in BC.  Patients and methods:   Real Time-quantitative Polymerase Chain reaction (RT-qPCR) was used to measure the levels of PCAT6 and miR-513a in BC tissues and cells. The Kaplan-Meier analysis was utilized to evaluate the overall survival time of BC patients. Besides, cell viability was detected by Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay. Cell migration and invasion were evaluated by wound healing and transwell assays. Furthermore, starBase and Dual-Luciferase reporter assay were used to determine the interaction between PCAT6 and miR-513a in BC cells.  Results:   PCAT6 expression was upregulated, while miR-513a was downregulated in BC tissues and cell lines. BC patients with high expression of PCAT6 exhibited a shorter overall survival time compared with those patients with low expression of PCAT6. Moreover, PCAT6 knockdown notably suppressed cell progression.

We seek to better understand the knowledge of medical trainees regarding this fundamental controversy and gain better insight into what they are being taught regarding this topic. Participants were medical students (n = 66) and residents (n = 60) from a single institution. REDCap software was used for informed consent, survey distribution, and data collection. Variables measured included PSA clinical knowledge, awareness of the PSA guideline changes, and attitudes, confidence, and viewpoints on use of PSA screening in clinical practice. More than 60% of medical trainees reported little or no knowledge of PSA screening guidelines. Although residents reported more knowledge than medical students, actual assessed knowledge of PSA screening did not differ between groups. Trainees reported receiving education primarily from other healthcare professionals and didactics, with some self-learning online. Though confidence was low overall, residents were more confident than medical students in discussing PSA screening with patients. The majority of respondents wanted more information about PSA testing, with medical students particularly interested in diagnosis/detection, treatment, and survival. Overall, opinions towards PSA testing as an aid were generally positive. Better education about the current PSA screening guidelines for medical trainees is imperative, particularly given that shared decision-making is of great importance when counseling patients on cancer screening.""","""['Tyler Sheetz', 'Sabrina Amin', 'Dinah Diab', 'Nicolette Payne', 'Tasha Posid']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""J Cancer Educ""","""[""Prostate cancer survivors' beliefs about screening and treatment decision-making experiences in an era of controversy."", 'Do Men Receive Information Required for Shared Decision Making About PSA Testing?

Methods:   Prospective, single centre cohort study (August 2018-April 2019). All patients referred with serum PSA ≥ 3 ng/ml or abnormal digital rectal examination received bpMRI and risk for PCa was calculated using the ERSPC risk-calculator. Men with either PI-RADS ≥ 3 or calculator risk-score > 20% were recommended to undergo systematic biopsy (SB) and targeted biopsy (TB) of any visible lesion (reference pathway). Eight different derived diagnostic pathways were compared to the reference pathway regarding cancer detection, number of biopsies and bpMRIs performed.  Results:   Of 496 patients; 233 (47%) had a risk-calculator score of > 20%; 201 (41%) had PI-RADS score ≥ 3. The reference pathway detected PCa in 32.1%, clinically significant (cs) PCa in 19.4%, with 41% avoided biopsies, but 0% avoided bpMRI. Stratification with only risk-calculator: 76% csPCa diagnosed, 53% avoided biopsies and 100% avoided bpMRI. Stratification with only bpMRI: 97% csPCa diagnosed, 59% avoided biopsies, but 0% avoided bpMRI. A pathway with risk-calculator first, followed only with bpMRI when high-risk: 81% csPCa diagnosed, 72% avoided biopsies and 53% avoided bpMRI.

No localized prostate cancer models were endorsed by the Precision Medicine Core committee, and 8th edition staging was based on expert consensus.  Objective:   To develop and validate a pretreatment clinical prognostic stage group system for nonmetastatic prostate cancer.  Design, setting, and participants:   This multinational cohort study included 7 centers from the United States, Canada, and Europe, the Shared Equal Access Regional Cancer Hospital (SEARCH) Veterans Affairs Medical Centers collaborative (5 centers), and the Cancer of the Prostate Strategic Urologic Research Endeavor (CaPSURE) registry (43 centers) (the STAR-CAP cohort). Patients with cT1-4N0-1M0 prostate adenocarcinoma treated from January 1, 1992, to December 31, 2013 (follow-up completed December 31, 2017). The STAR-CAP cohort was randomly divided into training and validation data sets; statisticians were blinded to the validation data until the model was locked. A Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) cohort was used as a second validation set. Analysis was performed from January 1, 2018, to November 30, 2019.  Exposures:   Curative intent radical prostatectomy (RP) or radiotherapy with or without androgen deprivation therapy.  Main outcomes and measures:   Prostate cancer-specific mortality (PCSM). Based on a competing-risk regression model, a points-based Score staging system was developed. Model discrimination (C index), calibration, and overall performance were assessed in the validation cohorts.  Results:   Of 19 684 patients included in the analysis (median age, 64.0 [interquartile range (IQR), 59.0-70.0] years), 12 421 were treated with RP and 7263 with radiotherapy. Median follow-up was 71.8 (IQR, 34.3-124.3) months; 4078 (20.7%) were followed up for at least 10 years. Age, T category, N category, Gleason grade, pretreatment serum prostate-specific antigen level, and the percentage of positive core biopsy results among biopsies performed were included as variables. In the validation set, predicted 10-year PCSM for the 9 Score groups ranged from 0.3% to 40.0%. The 10-year C index (0.796; 95% CI, 0.760-0.828) exceeded that of the AJCC 8th edition (0.757; 95% CI, 0.719-0.792), which was improved across age, race, and treatment modality and within the SEER validation cohort. The Score system performed similarly to individualized random survival forest and interaction models and outperformed National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) and Cancer of the Prostate Risk Assessment (CAPRA) risk grouping 3- and 4-tier classification systems (10-year C index for NCCN 3-tier, 0.729; for NCCN 4-tier, 0.746; for Score, 0.794) as well as CAPRA (10-year C index for CAPRA, 0.760; for Score, 0.782).

RT-qPCR was performed to detect the expression levels of circMTO1 and miR-199a-3p in the cell lines and tissues of gastric cancer. The effect of circMTO1 and miR-199a-3p on the growth and apoptosis of tumor cells was detected by BrdU incorporation and Annexin V/PI staining. Target gene prediction and screening, and luciferase reporter assays were performed to validate downstream interested genes of circMTO1 and miR-199a-3p. The expression levels of miR-199a-3p target gene PAWR (named as PRKC apoptosis WT1 Regulator Protein) was measured by RT-qPCR and Western blotting. Tumor changes in mice were detected by transfecting circMTO1. The expression of circMTO1 was significantly downregulated in the cell lines and tissues of gastric cancer, and low expression levels of circMTO1 were closely associated with poor prognosis. Overexpression of circMTO1 inhibited tumor growth, enhanced apoptosis rate and decreased cell invasion and migration. There was a significant negative relationship between the expression levels of circMTO1 and miR-199a-3p in gastric cancer tissues. Inhibiting miR-199a-3p expression or overexpression of PAWR could decrease the promotive effects of knockdown of circMTO1 on the progression of gastric cancer, and a positive relationship was established between the expression of circMTO1 and PAWR. circMTO1 can regulate the growth of gastric cancer cells by regulating miR-199a-3p/PAWR axis, thus inhibiting the development and progression of gastric cancer.

In this paper, methodology is developed to accurately estimate the difference in expected Brier scores derived from nested survival models and to compute an accompanying variance estimate of this difference. The methodology is applicable to time invariant and time-varying coefficient Cox survival models. The nested survival model approach is often applied to the scenario where the full model consists of conventional and new covariates and the subset model contains the conventional covariates alone. A complicating factor in the methodologic development is that the Cox model specification cannot, in general, be simultaneously satisfied for nested models. The problem has been resolved by projecting the properly specified full survival model onto the lower dimensional space of conventional markers alone.

This study was performed to elucidate the potential effects of KDM5A on prostate cancer (PCa) progression via the miR-495/YTHDF2/m6A-MOB3B axis.  Methods:   The expression of KDM5A, miR-495, YTHDF2 and MOB3B was validated in human PCa tissues and cell lines. Ectopic expression and knockdown experiments were developed in PCa cells to evaluate their effects on PCa cell proliferation, migration, invasion and apoptosis. Mechanistic insights into the interaction among KDM5A, miR-495, YTHDF2 and MOB3B were obtained after dual luciferase reporter, ChIP, and PAR-CLIP assays. Me-RIP assay was used to determine m6A modification level of MOB3B mRNA in PCa cells. Mouse xenograft models of PCa cells were also established to monitor the tumor growth.  Results:   KDM5A was highly expressed in human PCa tissues and cell lines. Upregulated KDM5A stimulated PCa cell proliferation, migration and invasion, but reduced cell apoptosis. Mechanistically, KDM5A, as a H3K4me3 demethylase, bound to the miR-495 promoter, which led to inhibition of its transcription and expression. As a target of miR-495, YTHDF2 could inhibit MOB3B expression by recognizing m6A modification of MOB3B mRNA and inducing mRNA degradation. Furthermore, KDM5A was found to downregulate MOB3B expression, consequently augmenting PCa cell proliferation, migration and invasion in vitro and promoting tumor growth in vivo via the miR-495/YTHDF2 axis.

Methods:   Retrospective analysis was applied to patients who underwent RARP between October 2010 and July 2014. The following parameters were assessed in all patients: age, body mass index (BMI), prostate-specific antigen, magnetic resonance imaging and pressure-flow studies findings. The impact of preoperative and intraoperative factors on postoperative urinary incontinence (UI) was assessed using multivariate logistic regression analysis. To evaluate the effects of IPP, the patients were divided into groups according to the IPP length: Group 1, < 5 mm and Group 2, ≥ 5 mm. The International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS), Overactive Bladder Symptom Score, Quality of Life index and the number of pads used were assessed.  Results:   A total of 119 patients were eligible for this study. Multivariate analyses showed that IPP (odds ratio (OR) 1.14, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.02-1.28, p < 0.05) and nerve-sparing (NS) (OR 0.23, 95% CI 0.18-0.61, p < 0.01) were significant factors related to UI in the first month after RARP. Twelve months after RARP, multivariate analyses revealed that only NS is a factor related to postoperative UI (OR 0.23, 95% CI 0.18-0.61, p < 0.01). The comparison of Groups 1 and 2 indicated significant differences in age (p < 0.01), prostate volume (p < 0.01), total IPSS and voiding symptom score (p < 0.05), compliance (p < 0.01), and detrusor pressure at maximum flow (p < 0.01). Group 1 had a higher continence rate (38.0%) than Group 2 (20.8%) in the first month after RARP (p < 0.05), but the difference was no longer significant from the third month after RARP. The total IPSS and voiding symptom scores were significantly different between the two groups before RARP, however, the significant difference disappeared from the first month after RARP.

Additionally, PSMA small molecule inhibitor was attached and quantified using DELFIA fluorescence assay. Finally, biological properties and radiolabeling yield were studied using confocal microscopy and ITLC-SG chromatography.  Results:   Two types of Dex-conjugates - micelle-like nanoparticles (NPs) and non-folded conjugates - were successfully generated and shown to exhibit cellular effects. The tertiary structure of the conjugates was found to influence the selectivity of PSMA and mediate cell binding as well as cellular uptake mechanisms. NPs were shown to be internalized by other, non - PSMA mediated channels. Simultaneously, the uptake of non-folded conjugates required PSMA inhibitor to pass through cell membrane.

We deduced KI-ARv-03 to be a potent, selective inhibitor of CDK9, an important cofactor for AR, MYC, and other oncogenic transcription factors.

Materials and methods:   Patient and physician reported data on 483 patients who underwent robot-assisted radical prostatectomy and Retzius-sparing robot-assisted radical prostatectomy from August 2017 to April 2020 by 3 experienced surgeons had been prospectively collected. Perioperative and pentafecta outcomes were analyzed using SPSS software. Patient reported outcome measures for urinary function, erectile function and quality of life were reported at baseline and at 7 days and 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months postoperatively.  Results:   A total of 201 patients underwent robot-assisted radical prostatectomy and 282 had Retzius-sparing robot-assisted radical prostatectomy. Patient and tumor characteristics were similar except for fewer low risk and more intermediate risk disease in robot-assisted radical prostatectomy vs Retzius-sparing robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (p <0.001). High risk disease was similar between groups (p=0.071). Immediate urinary continence was higher in Retzius-sparing robot-assisted radical prostatectomy group (70.4% vs 58.1%, p=0.02), with less nocturnal enuresis prevalence (p=0.011) and bother (p=0.009) with no significant differences afterwards. A better quality of life (p=0.004) was reported 1 week after surgery. No other differences in functional or quality of life outcomes, perioperative parameters, complications or margin rates were found.  Conclusions:   Retzius-sparing robot-assisted radical prostatectomy is associated with better immediate continence than anterior robot-assisted radical prostatectomy with no differences in longer-term functional recovery, quality of life or other important outcomes. The overall similarity in outcomes between groups lends support to the view that the surgical technique matters less than the surgeon performing it.""","""['Paolo Umari', 'Christopher Eden', 'Declan Cahill', 'Michele Rizzo', 'Dominic Eden', 'Prasanna Sooriakumaran']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""J Urol""","""['Retzius-sparing RARP: improving functional outcomes.', 'Editorial Comment.', 'Retzius Sparing Robot-Assisted Radical Prostatectomy Conveys Early Regain of Continence over Conventional Robot-Assisted Radical Prostatectomy: A Propensity Score Matched Analysis of 1,863 Patients.', 'A Pragmatic Randomized Controlled Trial Examining the Impact of the Retzius-sparing Approach on Early Urinary Continence Recovery After Robot-assisted Radical Prostatectomy.', 'Retzius-sparing Robot-assisted Radical Prostatectomy Leads to Durable Improvement in Urinary Function and Quality of Life Versus Standard Robot-assisted Radical Prostatectomy Without Compromise on Oncologic Efficacy: Single-surgeon Series and Step-by-step Guide.', 'Retzius Sparing Radical Prostatectomy Versus Robot-assisted Radical Prostatectomy: Which Technique Is More Beneficial for Prostate Cancer Patients (MASTER Study)?

The aim of our study was to evaluate the prognostic value of CD8+ TILs in prostate cancer patients undergoing radical prostatectomy (RP). We hypothesized that elevated density of CD8+ TILs in the RP specimen would correlate with improved clinical outcomes. This information may be helpful for future immunotherapy clinical trial design and treatment selection.  Methods:   Tumor microarrays constructed from 230 patients with localized prostate cancers who underwent RP from 2006 to 2012 at Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center were analyzed retrospectively using immunohistochemistry. CD8+ cell density was evaluated using a computerized scoring system. The cohorts were separated by CD8+ TIL density at the 25th percentile (i.e., low <quartile 1 and high ≥quartile 1). The quartile 1 threshold was chosen through a ""minimal p value approach"" based on overall survival with correction of significance to adjust for multiple testing. Clinical outcomes were compared in the high versus low CD8+ TIL density groups.  Results:   One hundred and forty-nine (65%) patients had high risk diseases (Gleason >7 or pT3/4). The median follow-up time was 8.4 years. High CD8+ TIL density was associated with improved 5-year overall survival (98% vs. 91%, p = .01) and prostate cancer-specific survival (99% vs. 95%, p = .04) compared with patients with low CD8+ TIL density. There was a trend toward higher 5-year biochemical recurrence-free survival and metastasis-free survival in the cohort of patients with high CD8+ TIL density (52% vs. 38% and 86% vs. 73%, respectively), although the difference did not reach statistical significance (p = .18 and p = .05, respectively). In a multivariate analysis high CD8+ TIL density was an independent favorable prognostic factor for overall survival (hazards ratio = 0.38; 95% confidence interval: 0.17-0.87; p = .02). In contrast to the prognostic value of CD8+ TIL density, the CD8+ cell density in the matched normal prostate tissue was not associated with any clinical outcomes.  Conclusion:   Intratumoral CD8+ T-cell infiltration in the RP specimen is independently associated with improved survival after RP in this high-risk prostate cancer cohort. Pre-RP immunomodulation that promotes intratumoral CD8+ cytotoxic T-cell infiltration may be beneficial for this population.""","""['Yuanquan Yang', 'Kristopher Attwood', 'Wiam Bshara', 'James L Mohler', 'Khurshid Guru', 'Bo Xu', 'Pawel Kalinski', 'Gurkamal Chatta']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes: A prognostic factor of PSA-free survival in patients with local prostate carcinoma treated by radical prostatectomy.', 'Clinical significance of intratumoral CD8+ regulatory T cells in prostate carcinoma.', 'Prognostic implications of tumor-infiltrating FoxP3+ regulatory T cells and CD8+ cytotoxic T cells in microsatellite-unstable gastric cancers.', 'Tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T cells combined with tumor-associated CD68+ macrophages predict postoperative prognosis and adjuvant chemotherapy benefit in resected gastric cancer.', 'Changes and prognostic values of tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte subsets after primary systemic therapy in breast cancer.', 'Single-cell RNA sequencing uncovers heterogeneous transcriptional signatures in tumor-infiltrated dendritic cells in prostate cancer.', 'Epigenetic modulation and prostate cancer: Paving the way for NK cell anti-tumor immunity.', 'MACC1 as a Potential Target for the Treatment and Prevention of Breast Cancer.', 'Infiltrating immune cells in prostate cancer tissue after androgen deprivation and radiotherapy.', 'Constructing a thyroid cancer prognostic risk model based on CD8+ T cell associated genes.']"""

Prostate-specific membrane antigen positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PSMA-PET/CT)-based stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) is emerging as an alternative option to postpone starting ADT and its associated side effects including the development of drug resistance. The aim of this study was to determine progression free-survival (PFS) and treatment failure free-survival (TFFS) after PSMA-PET/CT-based SBRT in OMPC patients. The efficacy and safety of single fraction radiosurgery (SFRS) and ADT delay were investigated.  Methods:   Patients with ≤5 metastases from OMPC, with/without ADT treated with PSMA-PET/CT-based SBRT were retrospectively analyzed. PFS and TFFS were primary endpoints. Secondary endpoints were local control (LC), overall survival (OS) and ADT-free survival (ADTFS).  Results:   Fifty patients with a total of 75 metastases detected by PSMA-PET/CT were analyzed. At the time of SBRT, 70% of patients were castration-sensitive. Overall, 80% of metastases were treated with SFRS (median dose 20 Gy, range: 16-25). After median follow-up of 34 months (range: 5-70) median PFS and TFFS were 12 months (range: 2-63) and 14 months (range: 2-70), respectively. Thirty-two (64%) patients had repeat oligometastatic disease. Twenty-four (48%) patients with progression underwent second SBRT course. Two-year LC after SFRS was 96%. Grade 1 and 2 toxicity occurred in 3 (6%) and 1 (2%) patients, respectively. ADTFS and OS rates at 2-years were 60.5% and 100%, respectively. In multivariate analysis, TFFS significantly improved in patients with time to first metastasis (TTM) >36 months (p = 0.01) and PSA before SBRT ≤1 ng/ml (p = 0.03).  Conclusion:   For patients with OMPC, SBRT might be used as an alternative to ADT. This way, the start/escalation of palliative ADT and its side effects can be deferred. Metastases treated with PSMA-PET/CT-based SFRS reached excellent LC with minimal toxicity. Low PSA levels and longer TTM predict elongated TFFS.""","""['Goda Kalinauskaite', 'Carolin Senger', 'Anne Kluge', 'Christian Furth', 'Markus Kufeld', 'Ingeborg Tinhofer', 'Volker Budach', 'Marcus Beck', 'Alexandra Hochreiter', 'Arne Grün', 'Carmen Stromberger']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Prostate-specific membrane antigen-positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PSMA-PET/CT)-guided stereotactic ablative body radiotherapy for oligometastatic prostate cancer: a single-institution experience and review of the published literature.', 'Benefits of Using Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy in Patients With Metachronous Oligometastases of Hormone-Sensitive Prostate Cancer Detected by 18Ffluoromethylcholine PET/CT.', '68Ga-PSMA-PET/CT-directed IGRT/SBRT for oligometastases of recurrent prostate cancer after initial surgery.', 'Serial stereotactic body radiation therapy for oligometastatic prostate cancer detected by novel PET-based radiotracers.', 'A Review of Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy in the Management of Oligometastatic Prostate Cancer.', 'Changing Role of PET/CT in Cancer Care With a Focus on Radiotherapy.', 'Management of Patients with Recurrent and Metachronous Oligometastatic Prostate Cancer in the Era of PSMA PET.', 'Current role of prostate-specific membrane antigen-based imaging and radioligand therapy in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'PSMA and Choline PET for the Assessment of Response to Therapy and Survival Outcomes in Prostate Cancer Patients: A Systematic Review from the Literature.', 'Radiotherapy in oligometastatic prostate cancer-a\xa0pattern of care survey among members of the German Society for Radiation Oncology (DEGRO).']"""

In metastasis and invasion of cancer the Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT) of cancerous cells is an important process. Our goal was to understand the effect of Rosuvastatin on the EMT process in human prostate cancer cell line PC-3 cells in adherent 2 dimensional (2D) and spheroid 3 dimensional (3D) culture. PC-3 cells were cultured in adherence and/or spheroid culture system. The cells were treated with different concentrations of Rosuvastatin. After 96 h, the cell proliferation, viability, type and number of spheroids, the expression of E-Cadherin, Vimentin and Zeb-1 were analyzed. The results show that Rosuvastatin inhibit cell proliferation without significant cytotoxicity. The spheroid formation and spheroid sizes were inhibited by Rousavastatin in a dose dependent manner. In 2D culture, expression of the E-Cadherin was increased up to 2.0 fold in a dose dependent linear manner (R2 = 0.89). Vimentin and Zeb-1 expressions were decreased up to 40 and 20% of untreated control cells expression level respectively, (R2 = 0.99 and 0.92). In 3D system, the expression of E-Cadherin did not show a significant change, but Vimentin and Zeb-1 expressions were decreased up to 70 and 40% of untreated control cells expression level respectively in a dose dependent linear manner in comparison to 2D system (R2 = 0.36 and 0.90). Our finding indicates that Rousavastatin inhibit cell proliferation and spheroid formation of PC-3 cells. This inhibition accompanies by inhibition of EMT markers.

The aim of this study was to identify the prognostic lncRNAs and construct an lncRNA signature for PCa diagnosis by the interaction network between lncRNAs and protein-coding genes (PCGs). The differentially expressed lncRNAs (DElncRNAs) and PCGs (DEPCGs) between PCa and normal prostate tissues were screened from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. The DEPCGs were functionally annotated in terms of the enriched pathways. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) of 104 PCa samples identified 15 co-expression modules, of which the Turquoise module was negatively correlated with cancer and included 5 key lncRNAs and 47 PCGs. KEGG pathway analyses of the core 47 PCGs showed significant enrichment in classic PCa-related pathways, and overlapped with the enriched pathways of the DEPCGs. LINC00857, LINC00900, LINC00908, LINC00900, SNHG3 and FENDRR were significantly associated with the survival of PCa and have not been reported previously. Finally, Multivariable Cox regression analysis was used to establish a prognostic risk formula, and the patients were accordingly stratified into the low- and high-risk groups. The latter had significantly worse OS compared to the low-risk group (P < 0.01), and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) of 14-year OS was 0.829.

Then, the interactions between study period and insurance status were assessed.  Results:   In total, 1,279,738 patients were included in the study. Of these, patients with breast cancer who were insured by Medicare (odds ratio [OR], 0.75; P < .001), Medicaid (OR, 0.55; P < .001), or uninsured (OR, 0.50; P < .001); patients with prostate cancer who were insured by Medicare (OR, 0.87; P = .003), Medicaid (OR, 0.58; P = .001), or uninsured (OR, 0.36; P < .001); and patients with lung cancer who were insured by Medicare (OR, 0.84; P = .020), Medicaid (OR, 0.74; P = .001), or uninsured (OR, 0.48; P < .001) were less likely to receive surgical care at high-volume hospitals compared with patients who had private insurance. For patients with colorectal cancer, the effect of insurance differed by study period, and improved since 2011. For those on Medicaid, the odds of receiving care at a high-volume hospital were 0.51 during 2004 through 2007 and 0.99 during 2014 through 2016 (P for interaction = .001); for uninsured patients, the odds were 0.45 during 2004 through 2007 and 1.19 during 2014 through 2016 (P for interaction < .001) compared with patients who had private insurance.

Triptolide, a potent inhibitor of eukaryotic transcription, possesses potent antitumor activity. However, its clinical potential has been limited by toxicity and water solubility. To address those limitations of triptolide, we designed and synthesized glucose-triptolide conjugates (glutriptolides) and demonstrated their antitumor activity in vitro and in vivo. Herein, we identified a lead, glutriptolide-2 with an altered linker structure. Glutriptolide-2 possessed improved stability in human serum, greater selectivity toward cancer over normal cells, and increased potency against cancer cells. Glutriptolide-2 exhibits sustained antitumor activity, prolonging survival in a prostate cancer metastasis animal model.

In the present study, we identified 469 novel androgen-responsive lncRNAs using microarray data. After validating the accuracy of the array data, we constructed a transcriptional network which contained more than 30 transcriptional factors using ChIP-seq data to explore upstream regulators of androgen-responsive lncRNAs. Next, we conducted bioinformatics analysis to identify lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA regulatory network. To explore the potential roles of androgen-responsive lncRNAs in hormone-related cancers, we performed coexpression network and PPI network analyses using TCGA data. GO and KEGG analyses showed these lncRNAs were mainly involved in regulating signal transduction, transcription, development, cell adhesion, immune response, cell differentiation, and MAPK signaling pathway.

Early detection of prostate cancer is the key to successful treatment. Ultrasound imaging is one of the most suitable methods for the early detection of prostate cancer. Although ultrasound images can show cancer lesions, subjective interpretation is not accurate. Therefore, this paper proposes a transrectal ultrasound image analysis method, aiming at characterizing prostate tissue through image processing to evaluate the possibility of malignant tumours. Firstly, the input image is preprocessed by optical density conversion. Then, local binarization and Gaussian Markov random fields are used to extract texture features, and the linear combination is performed. Finally, the fused texture features are provided to SVM classifier for classification. The method has been applied to data set of 342 transrectal ultrasound images obtained from hospitals with an accuracy of 70.93%, sensitivity of 70.00%, and specificity of 71.74%.

The TCP describes the dose-response of prostate after definitive radiotherapy (RT). Also, to analyse and identify possible significant correlations between clinical and treatment factors such as planned dose to prostate gland, dose to GTV, volume of prostate and mpMRI-GTV based on multivariate logistic regression model.  Methods:   The study included 129 intermediate and high-risk prostate cancer patients (cN0 and cM0), who were treated with image-guided intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) ± androgen deprivation therapy with a median follow-up period of 81.4 months (range 42.0-149.0) months. Tumour control was defined as biochemical relapse free survival according to the Phoenix definition (BRFS). MpMRI-GTV was delineated retrospectively based on a pre-treatment multi-parametric MR imaging (mpMRI), which was co-registered to the planning CT. The clinical treatment planning procedure was based on prostate gland, delineated on CT imaging modality. Furthermore, we also fitted the clinical data to TCP model for the two considered targets for the 5-year follow-up after radiation treatment, where our cohort was composed of a total number of 108 patients, of which 19 were biochemical relapse (BR) patients.  Results:   For the median follow-up period of 81.4 months (range 42.0-149.0) months, our results indicated an appropriate α/β = 1.3 Gy for prostate gland and α/β = 2.9 Gy for mpMRI-GTV. Only for prostate gland, EQD2 and gEUD2Gy were significantly lower in the biochemical relapse (BR) group compared to the biochemical control (BC) group. Fitting results to the linear-quadratic Poisson TCP model for prostate gland and α/β = 1.3 Gy were D50 = 66.8 Gy with 95% CI [64.6 Gy, 69.0 Gy], and γ = 3.8 with 95% CI [2.6, 5.2]. For mpMRI-GTV and α/β = 2.9 Gy, D50 was 68.1 Gy with 95% CI [66.1 Gy, 70.0 Gy], and γ = 4.5 with 95% CI [3.0, 6.1]. Finally, for the 5-year follow-up after the radiation treatment, our results for the prostate gland were: D50 = 64.6 Gy [61.6 Gy, 67.4 Gy], γ = 3.1 [2.0, 4.4], α/β = 2.2 Gy (95% CI was undefined). For the mpMRI-GTV, the optimizer was unable to deliver any reasonable results for the expected clinical D50 and α/β. The results for the mpMRI-GTV were D50 = 50.1 Gy [44.6 Gy, 56.0 Gy], γ = 0.8 [0.5, 1.2], α/β = 0.0 Gy (95% CI was undefined). For a follow-up time of 5 years and a fixed α/β = 1.6 Gy, the TCP fitting results for prostate gland were D50 = 63.9 Gy [60.8 Gy, 67.0 Gy], γ = 2.9 [1.9, 4.1], and for mpMRI-GTV D50 = 56.3 Gy [51.6 Gy, 61.1 Gy], γ = 1.3 [0.8, 1.9].  Conclusion:   The linear-quadratic Poisson TCP model was better fit when the prostate gland was considered as responsible target than with mpMRI-GTV. This is compatible with the results of the comparison of the dose distributions among BR and BC groups and with the results achieved with the multivariate logistic model regarding gEUD2Gy. Probably limitations of mpMRI in defining the GTV explain these results. Another explanation could be the relatively homogeneous dose prescription and the relatively low number of recurrences. The failure to identify any benefit for considering mpMRI-GTV as the target responsible for the clinical response is confirmed when considering a fixed α/β = 1.6 Gy, a fixed follow-up time for biochemical response at 5 years or Gleason score differentiation.""","""['Ilias Sachpazidis', 'Panayiotis Mavroidis', 'Constantinos Zamboglou', 'Christina Marie Klein', 'Anca-Ligia Grosu', 'Dimos Baltas']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Radiat Oncol""","""['Focal dose escalation for prostate cancer using 68Ga-HBED-CC PSMA PET/CT and MRI: a planning study based on histology reference.', 'Predicting Biochemical Failure in Irradiated Patients With Prostate Cancer by Tumour Volume Measured by Multiparametric MRI.', '68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT and multiparametric MRI for gross tumor volume delineation in a slice by slice analysis with whole mount histopathology as a reference standard - Implications for focal radiotherapy planning in primary prostate cancer.', 'Prostate cancer dose-response, fractionation sensitivity and repopulation parameters evaluation from 25 international radiotherapy outcome data sets.', 'Focal therapy for localized prostate cancer in the era of routine multi-parametric MRI.', 'Predicting Local Failure after Partial Prostate Re-Irradiation Using a Dosiomic-Based Machine Learning Model.', 'Evaluating the impact of possible interobserver variability in CBCT-based soft-tissue matching using TCP/NTCP models for prostate cancer radiotherapy.', 'Variability of α/β ratios for prostate cancer with the fractionation schedule: caution against using the linear-quadratic model for hypofractionated radiotherapy.', 'Patient-related risk factors for late rectal bleeding after hypofractionated radiotherapy for localized prostate cancer: a single-center retrospective study.', 'Influence of Urethra Sparing on Tumor Control Probability and Normal Tissue Complication Probability in Focal Dose Escalated Hypofractionated Radiotherapy: A Planning Study Based on Histopathology Reference.']"""

This study aimed to validate the EPIC-CP Portuguese version, and evaluate its role in presenting early functional outcomes of surgically treated prostate cancer patients at a Latin American referral center.  Methods:   The EPIC-CP was self-administered prospectively and individually by all localized prostate cancer patients, before and after robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy, from March 2017 to June 2018 at a single institution. For validation, we used the Cronbach's alpha coefficient to evaluate internal consistency. The EPIC-CP domains were compared before surgery, and 6 months and 12 months after surgery. Statistical analyses were performed using the student's t test, and Wilcoxon and Friedman tests, with p values < 0.05 considered significant.  Results:   One hundred and fifty two patients answered the EPIC-CP. The patients had a median age of 62.7 (± 8.5) years and prostate specific antigen level of 6.3 (± 4.6) ng/ml. The Cronbach's alpha varied from 0.75 to 0.77 for all domains with good internal consistency, except for the ""vitality/hormonal"" domain, which had a score of 0.35. The domain evolution for the preoperative and 6-month postoperative groups revealed that the domains related to urinary continence and bowel worsened, and were increased during the first 6 months; however, this variation had no obvious clinical implications, and the irritative symptoms improved. Regarding the sexual domain, the scores worsened, and also increased over the first 6 months. The results of the confirmatory factor analysis were robust, with an explained variance of 0.951 and covariance of 0.929.

Although elderly patients are commonly encountered in clinical practice, few studies have focused on the value of chemotherapy in elderly patients. In this study, we reviewed the use of docetaxel with prednisolone in elderly men (aged ≥80 years) with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) at Ningbo First Hospital with a focus on efficacy and toxicity.  Methods:   A retrospective study including a series of men aged ≥80 years with mCRPC and received docetaxel plus prednisone chemotherapy between August 2011 and May 2019. All these cases were selected from the Ningbo First Hospital prostate cancer database located in Zhejiang Province, China.  Results:   Sixteen patients were identified, with a mean age of 82 years (range, 80 to 87 years). All patients have received a median of four and half cycles (range, 1-10) of 3-week (60-75 mg/m2 ) docetaxel regimens and 5 mg prednisone twice per day. Seven (43.75%) patients completed more than six cycles. Ten (62.50%) patients had a good prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response of ≥50% decline. Eight (50.00%) patients had ostealgia before receiving docetaxel treatment and six of them (75.00%) experienced reduced pain after the treatment. Hematologic toxicity was observed in six (37.50%) patients with neutropenia, one of which was diagnosed with agranulocytosis and had to be admitted for the same reason. Other adverse reactions such as fever, debilitation, and alopecia were also observed.  Conclusions:   Very elderly patients (aged ≥80 years) with mCRPC are easy to be neglected and infrequently involved in clinical trials. Our study demonstrates that docetaxel chemotherapy plus prednisone is tolerable and effective among Chinese elderly patients (≥80 years) with mCRPC.

The goal of the present study was to understand how Cx43 influences PCa cells sensitivity and aggressiveness to bone microenvironment. By means of Cx43-overexpressing PCa cell lines, we revealed a Cx43-dependent promigratory effect of osteoblastic conditioned media (ObCM). This effect on directional migration relied on the presence of Cx43 at the plasma membrane and not on gap junctional intercellular communication and hemichannel functions. ObCM stimulation induced Rac1 activation and Cx43 interaction with cortactin in protrusions of migrating PCa cells. Finally, by transfecting two different truncated forms of Cx43 in LNCaP cells, we determined that the carboxy terminal (CT) part of Cx43 is crucial for the responsiveness of PCa cells to ObCM.

The secondary objective was to evaluate clinical factors and prostate specific antigen as predictors of clinically significant prostate cancer at baseline.  Materials and methods:   All 503 consecutive patients who were biopsy naïve referred from 2007 to 2017 for biopsy with negative magnetic resonance imaging (PI-RADS™ 1-2) who had systematic 12-core biopsies at baseline were included. Clinical factors were digital rectal examination, prostate cancer family history and prostate specific antigen. In case of suspicious digital rectal examination or prostate specific antigen kinetics during followup, magnetic resonance imaging and biopsy were performed. Clinically significant prostate cancer was defined as either Gleason Grade 1 with cancer core length greater than 5 mm or 3 or more positive systematic 12-core biopsies in addition to Gleason Grade 2 or greater (clinically significant prostate cancer-1) or any Gleason Grade 2 or greater (clinically significant prostate cancer-2). Nonclinically significant prostate cancer was defined as either Gleason Grade 1 with cancer core length 5 mm or less and fewer than 3 positive systematic 12-core biopsies (nonclinically significant prostate cancer-1) or any Gleason Grade 1 (nonclinically significant prostate cancer-2). Definition of high risk clinically significant prostate cancer was Gleason Grade 3 or greater. Univariate and multivariate models were fitted to identify predictors of clinically significant prostate cancer risk.  Results:   At baseline, biopsy showed clinically significant prostate cancer-1 in 9% (45), clinically significant prostate cancer-2 in 6% (29) and nonclinically significant prostate cancer in 22% (111). At median followup of 4 years (IQR 1.6-7.1), 31% (95% CI 27-36) of 415 untreated patients had a second magnetic resonance imaging and 24% (95% CI 20-28) a second biopsy that showed clinically significant prostate cancer-1 in 5% (21/415, 95% CI 3-7), clinically significant prostate cancer-2 in 2% (7/415, 95% CI 1-3) and nonclinically significant prostate cancer in 8%. Overall incidence was 13% (66/503, 95% CI 7-21) for clinically significant prostate cancer-1, 7% (36/503, 95% CI 5-9%) for clinically significant prostate cancer-2 and 2% (12/503, 95% CI 1.1-3.7) for high risk prostate cancer. Predictors of clinically significant prostate cancer risk were prostate specific antigen density 0.15 ng/ml/ml or greater (OR 2.43, 1.19-4.21), clinical stage T2a or greater (OR 3.32, 1.69-6.53) and prostate cancer family history (OR 2.38, 1.10-6.16). Performing biopsy in patients with negative magnetic resonance imaging and prostate specific antigen density 0.15 ng/ml/ml or greater or abnormal digital rectal examination or prostate cancer family history would have decreased from 9% to 2.4% the risk of missing clinically significant prostate cancer-1 at baseline while avoiding biopsy in 56% of cases.

We sought to validate an optimal MyProstateScore threshold for clinical use in ruling out grade group ≥2 cancer in men referred for biopsy.  Materials and methods:   Biopsy naïve men provided post-digital rectal examination urine prior to biopsy. MyProstateScore was calculated using the validated, locked multivariable model including only serum prostate specific antigen, urinary prostate cancer antigen 3 and urinary TMPRSS2:ERG. The MyProstateScore threshold approximating 95% sensitivity for grade group ≥2 cancer was identified in a training cohort, and performance was measured in 2 external validation cohorts. We assessed the 1) overall biopsy referral population and 2) population meeting guideline based testing criteria (ie, prostate specific antigen 3-10, or <3 with suspicious digital rectal examination).  Results:   Validation cohorts were prospectively enrolled from academic (977 patients, median prostate specific antigen 4.5, IQR 3.1-6.0) and community (548, median prostate specific antigen 4.9, IQR 3.7-6.8) settings. In the overall validation population (1,525 patients), 338 men (22%) had grade group ≥2 cancer on biopsy. The MyProstateScore threshold of 10 provided 97% sensitivity and 98% negative predictive value for grade group ≥2 cancer. MyProstateScore testing would have prevented 387 unnecessary biopsies (33%), while missing only 10 grade group ≥2 cancers (3.0%). In 1,242 patients meeting guideline based criteria, MyProstateScore ≤10 provided 96% sensitivity and 97% negative predictive value, and would have prevented 32% of unnecessary biopsies, missing 3.7% of grade group ≥2 cancers.  Conclusions:   In a large, clinically pertinent biopsy referral population, MyProstateScore ≤10 provided exceptional sensitivity and negative predictive value for ruling out grade group ≥2 cancer.

Materials and methods:   Retrospective analyses were conducted of 889 men aged 50 to 75 years old with negative baseline prostate biopsy and 2-year repeat biopsy positive for prostate cancer in the Reduction by Dutasteride of Prostate Cancer Events (REDUCE) study. Acute and chronic prostate inflammation and cancer grade were determined by central pathology during the REDUCE study. The association of inflammation in baseline and 2-year repeat biopsy and prostate cancer grade in 2-year repeat biopsy was evaluated with Student's t-test, chi-squared test and multivariable logistic regression.  Results:   Chronic, acute inflammation and both were detected in 533 (60%), 12 (1%) and 85 (10%) baseline biopsies, respectively. Presence of acute and chronic inflammation were significantly associated with each other (p <0.001). Both types of inflammation were unrelated to race, body mass index, prostate specific antigen or digital rectal exam.

Conversely, low muscle mass (sarcopenia) and low muscle radiodensity (myosteatosis) are associated with worse overall survival in many cancers. This study seeks to evaluate the relationship of sarcopenia, myosteatosis and obesity with overall survival in men with metastatic or castrate-resistant prostate cancer.  Materials and methods:   Retrospective analysis of men with metastatic or castrate-resistant prostate cancer and computerized tomography of abdomen/pelvis presenting to the Vanderbilt Comprehensive Prostate Cancer Clinic from 2012 to 2017 was performed. Demographic, pathological and survival data were described, with sarcopenia and myosteatosis determined from abdominal skeletal muscle area and skeletal muscle radiodensity, respectively. Kaplan-Meier curves and log-rank tests estimated the effect of body composition on survival. Multivariable Cox proportional hazard models were performed adjusting for age, Charlson comorbidity index, race and clinical stage. ANOVA was used to compare obese and nonobese men with and without sarcopenia or myosteatosis.  Results:   Of 182 men accrued, 37.4% were obese, 53.3% sarcopenic and 59.3% myosteatotic. Over a median followup of 33.9 months, body mass index was associated with reduced mortality (HR 0.93, p=0.02), as was visceral adiposity (HR 0.99, p=0.003). Men with high body mass index without sarcopenia/myosteatosis lived significantly longer than men with high body mass index with sarcopenia/myosteatosis or normal body mass index men (F[3,91]=4.03, p=0.01).  Conclusions:   Both high body mass index and visceral adiposity in metastatic or castrate-resistant prostate cancer are associated with reduced mortality, independent of sarcopenia and myosteatosis. Therefore, routine clinical workup should include calculation of body mass index and measurement of waist circumference.

We evaluated benign histological features on magnetic resonance imaging targeted prostate biopsy to determine if they predict the likelihood of missed cancer on subsequent biopsy.  Materials and methods:   Between June 2012 and September 2016, 1,595 men were enrolled in a prospective study of magnetic resonance imaging targeted and systematic biopsy outcomes. We re-reviewed pathology from benign biopsies of PI-RADS 4/5 abnormalities and divided them into 5 groups for comparison to outcomes of clinical followup: inflammation (38%), stroma/glandular hyperplasia (9%), normal prostate tissue (28%), atypical small acinar proliferation/high grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (9%) and cancer in adjacent systematic cores (16%).  Results:   Of 497 men 88 (18%) with PI-RADS 4/5 abnormality prior to initial biopsy had no cancer on magnetic resonance imaging targeted prostate biopsy. On followup, 45 men underwent repeat magnetic resonance imaging: 12 (27%) had persistent PI-RADS 4/5 abnormalities, 17 (38%) had PI-RADS 2/3, 16 (35%) had PI-RADS 1. On repeat magnetic resonance imaging targeted prostate biopsy, cancer was found in 62.5% of men with PI-RADS 4/5 and 23% of men with PI-RADS 2/3. Histological groups on initial biopsy were not predictive of the likelihood of PI-RADS downgrade on repeat magnetic resonance imaging or cancer detection on repeat biopsy.  Conclusions:   Among men with no cancer on magnetic resonance imaging targeted prostate biopsy performed for PI-RADS abnormality, downgrade of PI-RADS score is noted in 73% on repeat magnetic resonance imaging. Persistence of PI-RADS 4/5 predicts a higher risk of missed cancer, warranting prompt re-biopsy.

Methods:   We obtained long-term follow-up (16.7 years) in 581 patients having undergone radical retropubic prostatectomy between 1985 and 1995. We excluded those with seminal vesicle and/or lymphatic involvement. We regraded the specimens according to contemporary guidelines and compared how this affected outcomes compared with their original (pre-1995) Gleason scoring. In total, 499 patients were evaluable.  Results:   A Gleason score of 6 or less declined from 73% to 29%, and the number increased from 25% to 63% for a Gleason score of 7 and from 5% to 8% for a Gleason score of 8 to 9. As a result, for a Gleason score less than 7, biochemical failure decreased from 28% to 23%, metastatic disease 5% to 2%, and prostate cancer death from 5% to 3%. The same results were 50% to 37%, 11% to 7%, and 10% to 6% for a Gleason score of 7 and 86% to 71%, 43% to 32%, and 29% to 26% for a Gleason score more than 7, respectively. With the most recent grade grouping, for groups 1 to 5, biochemical failure occurred in 23%, 32%, 45%, 69%, and 78%, respectively. Metastatic disease occurred in 2%, 4%, 12%, 24%, and 56%, respectively. Prostate cancer-related death occurred in 2%, 4%, 9%, 21%, and 44%, respectively.  Conclusions:   The revised Gleason scores improved the outcomes in all risk groups.

However, outcome data are scarce in resource-limited settings. We conducted a retrospective analysis of survival in a cohort of patients treated with this strategy in Sri Lanka.  Patients and methods:   All patients with localized cervical cancer treated with primary EBRT and intracavitary brachytherapy from 2014 to 2015 were included in the study. Primary end point was disease-free survival (DFS), defined as time to local or systemic recurrence or death. Univariable analysis was performed to determine the prognostic significance of the following variables: age, stage, use of concurrent chemotherapy, EBRT dose, brachytherapy dose, and time to completion of treatment (dichotomized at 60 days). Factors significant on univariable analysis were included in a multivariable model.  Results:   A total of 113 patients with available data were included in the analysis. Mean age was 58 years (range, 35-85 years), and most patients (n = 103 of 113) presented with stage ≥ IIB disease. Median time to delivery of brachytherapy from commencement of EBRT was 110 days (range, 34-215 days), with only 12 (11%) of 113 patients completing treatment within 60 days. Median follow-up was 28 months (range, 5-60 months), and 2-year DFS was 63.7% (95% CI, 55.4% to 73.2%). Treatment delay was the only significant factor associated with inferior DFS on univariable analysis (log-rank P = .03), and therefore, multivariable analysis was not performed.

Delayed primary excision (DPE) after induction chemotherapy allows for a reduction in adjuvant radiation dose, but with the risk of potential surgical morbidity. The objectives of this study were to compare outcomes in children with group III RMS who did and did not undergo DPE and to assess surgical morbidity.  Methods:   The study included 369 patients who had clinical group III RMS at sites amenable to DPE from intermediate-risk Children's Oncology Group studies D9803 (encouraged DPE) and ARST0531 (discouraged DPE).  Results:   The primary tumor site was bladder/prostate (136 patients; 37%), extremity (97 patients; 26%), trunk (24 patients; 7%), retroperitoneum (91 patients; 25%), or intrathoracic/perineum/perianal (21 patients; 6%). In total, 112 patients (53.9%) underwent DPE in D9803, and 26 patients (16.2%) underwent DPE in ARST0531 (P < .001), with loss of vital organ or function in 30 of 138 patients (22%). DPE allowed for a reduced radiation dose in 110 of 135 patients (81%; 51% were reduced to 36 Gy, and 30% were reduced to 42 Gy). Patients who underwent DPE had improved unadjusted overall survival (P = .013).

This 3-year follow-up study assesses late adverse effects, evaluates rehabilitative long-term effects and identifies patients who benefit the most.  Design:   RePCa was a randomized clinical trial with multidisciplinary rehabilitation (n = 79) or usual care (n = 82). The intervention during the first 6 months consisted of consultations by nurses and physiotherapists focusing on psychosocial support and physical activity, respectively. Here we report the 3-year follow-up. Data consisted of disease-specific quality of life (EPIC-26), general quality of life (SF-12) and pelvic floor strength measured by electromyography.  Results:   One hundred forty-three patients (92%) responded. The primary outcome urinary irritative sum-score was no longer significantly different between groups. In patients with moderate-severe urinary problems at baseline, we observed a significant long-term effect on the urinary irritative sum-score in favour of the intervention (+ 13.4 points P = .014). More patients had moderate-severe bowel problems in the control group (n = 10; 14%) compared to the intervention group (n = 2; 3%) (P = .016). Pelvic floor strength deteriorated significantly in both groups.  Conclusion:   The short-term rehabilitation was beneficial but of limited benefit in the long term for all patients. A significant and clinically relevant effect was found in irradiated prostate cancer patients with moderate-severe urinary problems at baseline. In both groups, pelvic floor strength was weakened during follow-up.  Impact for cancer survivors:   Prior research showed patients benefit from early rehabilitation. Identification of patients with moderate-severe urinary problems followed by a focused rehabilitation during the first 6 months after radiotherapy results in long-term improvement. Radiated patients have to be aware of their pelvic floor strength.  Implications for cancer survivors:   Patients can be informed that they benefit from early rehabilitation, and they cannot expect larger changes in adverse effects within the first years, but they have to be aware of their pelvic floor strength. Future rehabilitation studies could be applied mainly to patients with assessed rehabilitation needs after radiotherapy and intensified with long-term follow-up.""","""['Karin B Dieperink', 'Steinbjørn Hansen', 'Lis Wagner', 'Lisbeth R Minet', 'Olfred Hansen']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""J Cancer Surviv""","""['The effects of multidisciplinary rehabilitation: RePCa-a randomised study among primary prostate cancer patients.', 'Male coping through a long-term cancer trajectory.

Their general HRQoL was assessed using a validated Japanese version of the Short-Form 8 Health Survey (SF-8) at enrolment and annually thereafter until discontinuation of AS. The SF-8 mental component summary (MCS) and physical component summary (PCS) of men on AS were compared with scores of the general population (norm-based score [NBS]: 50) and MCS and PCS scores for men following AS were analysed over time. We tested whether MCS and PCS scores over time explained discontinuation of AS.  Results:   Five hundred and twenty-five patients enrolled, and the median age at baseline was 68 years. At enrolment and after 1-, 2-, and 3-year follow-ups, the PCS and MCS scores were significantly higher than the NBS of the general Japanese population except for the median PCS at 3 years. We found that age at diagnosis and time on AS negatively affected the PCS score of men on AS, while every additional year on AS led to a 0.27 point increase in MCS scores.

The diagnostic performance of 18F-DCFPyL-PET/CT in localizing primary PCa within the prostate gland was assessed, allowing for PSMA-guided targeted-prostate biopsy.  Methods:   Thirty patients with intermediate-/high-risk primary PCa were prospectively enrolled between May 2018 and May 2019 and underwent 18F-DCFPyL-PET/CT prior to robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP). Two experienced and blinded nuclear medicine physicians assessed tumour localisation within the prostate gland on PET/CT, using a 12-segment mapping model of the prostate. The same model was used by a uro-pathologist for the RARP specimens. Based on PET/CT imaging, a potential biopsy recommendation was given per patient, based on the size and PET-intensity of the suspected PCa localisations. The biopsy recommendation was correlated to final histopathology in the RARP specimen. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) for clinically significant PCa (csPCa, Gleason score ≥ 3 + 4 = 7) were assessed.  Results:   The segments recommended for potential targeted biopsy harboured csPCA in 28/30 patients (93%), and covered the highest Gleason score PCa segment in 26/30 patient (87%). Overall, 122 of 420 segments (29.0%) contained csPCa at final histopathological examination. Sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV for csPCa per segment using 18F-DCFPyL-PET/CT were 61.4%, 88.3%, 68.1% and 84.8%, respectively.  Conclusions:   When comparing the PCa-localisation on 18F-DCFPyL-PET/CT with the RARP specimens, an accurate per-patient detection (93%) and localisation of csPCa was found.

Methods:   Retrospective analysis of ten patients who underwent 16 brachytherapy sessions under combined spinal epidural (CSE) anesthesia between April 2016 and December 2016 was done. The data were collected, tabulated using MS Excel, and statistically analyzed with EPI Info 6 and SPSS-16 statistical software (SPSS Inc. Chicago, USA) to draw relative conclusions.  Results:   The median peak sensory dermatome level achieved was T6 and the median maximum motor block achieved was grade 2. The mean (± standard deviation (SD)) time to sensory regression to T10 (range T5-T8) dermatome was found to be 118.00 ± 47.110 (range = 0-238) minutes.

However, it is unclear how prostate cancer cells sustain dysregulated fatty acid metabolism to drive AR-independent prostate cancer. Long-chain acyl-CoA synthetases (ACSL) catalyze the conversion of fatty acids into fatty acyl-CoAs that are required for fatty acid metabolism. In this study, we demonstrate that expression levels of ACSL3 and 4 were oppositely regulated by androgen-AR signaling in prostate cancer cells. AR served as a transcription suppressor to bind at the ACSL4 promoter region and inhibited its transcription. Inhibition of androgen-AR signaling significantly downregulated ACSL3 and PSA, but elevated ACSL4 levels. ACSL4 regulated a broad spectrum of fatty acyl-CoA levels, and its catalytic efficiency in fatty acyl-CoAs biosynthesis was about 1.9- to 4.3-fold higher than ACSL3. In addition, in contrast to ACSL3, ACSL4 significantly regulated global protein myristoylation or myristoylation of Src kinase in prostate cancer cells. Knockdown of ACSL4 inhibited the proliferation, migration, invasion, and xenograft growth of AR-independent prostate cancer cells. Our results suggest that the surge of ACSL4 levels by targeting AR signaling increases fatty acyl-CoAs biosynthesis and protein myristoylation, indicating the opposite, yet complementary or Yin-Yang regulation of ACSL3 and 4 levels in sustaining fatty acid metabolism when targeting androgen-AR signaling. This study reveals a mechanistic understanding of ACSL4 as a potential therapeutic target for treatment of AR-independent prostate cancer.

Results:   High white blood cell counts (<median vs. ≥median; hazard ratio [HR], 1.82, 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.14-2.89; P = 0.012) and high neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratios (<median vs. ≥median; HR, 1.90, 95% CI, 1.11-3.27; P = 0.020) were associated with a high risk of progression in univariate analysis. In univariate analysis, high hemoglobin (Hb) levels (<median vs. ≥median; HR, 0.41, 95% CI, 0.24-0.73; P = 0.0023) and high red cell distribution widths (<median vs. ≥median; HR, 2.41, 95% CI, 1.37-4.25; P = 0.0023) were associated with a low and a high risk of all-cause mortality, respectively. In multivariate analysis, high Hb levels (<median vs. ≥median; HR, 0.42, 95% CI, 0.22-0.79; P = 0.0076) were repeatedly associated with a low risk of all-cause mortality.  Conclusion:   We found that white blood cell counts and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratios may be prognostic for progression-free survival while red cell distribution widths may be prognostic for OS. In particular, a low Hb level was a robust prognostic factor for poor OS. These findings could be useful in predicting prognosis in CRPC patients treated with ARPIs.""","""['Asako Machidori', 'Masaki Shiota', 'Satoshi Kobayashi', 'Takashi Matsumoto', 'Keisuke Monji', 'Eiji Kashiwagi', 'Ario Takeuchi', 'Ryosuke Takahashi', 'Junichi Inokuchi', 'Masatoshi Eto']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Urol Oncol""","""['Differential prognostic impact of complete blood count-related parameters by prior use of novel androgen receptor pathway inhibitors in docetaxel-treated castration-resistant prostate cancer patients.', 'Blood-based gene expression signature associated with metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer patient response to abiraterone plus prednisone or enzalutamide.', 'AR-V7 in Peripheral Whole Blood of Patients with Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer: Association with Treatment-specific Outcome Under Abiraterone and Enzalutamide.', 'Revealing the prognostic landscape of neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio and platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer patients treated with abiraterone or enzalutamide: a meta-analysis.', 'Novel and next-generation androgen receptor-directed therapies for prostate cancer: Beyond abiraterone and enzalutamide.', 'Quantitative assessment of 99mTc-methylene diphosphonate bone SPECT/CT for assessing bone metastatic burden and its prognostic value in patients with castration-resistant prostate cancers: initial results in a single-center retrospective study.', 'Anticancer Effect of Second-line Treatment for Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer Following First-line Treatment with Androgen Receptor Pathway Inhibitors.', 'Pre-treatment red blood cell distribution width as a predictor of clinically significant prostate cancer.']"""

Traditional prostate nomograms assess age, serum prostatic-specific antigen (PSA), clinical stage, and biopsy parameters to inform decisions on pelvic lymph node dissection. The impact of intraductal carcinoma (IDC) and cribriform pattern 4 (CC) on nodal metastases has yet to be explored.  Methods:   Five hundred forty three radical prostatectomy cases were reviewed for International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) grade, CC/IDC, T- and N-stage. Two hundred seventy five cases had matched biopsies with age, serum PSA, CC/IDC and ISUP grade recorded. The association of CC/IDC with pN1 in both prostatectomy and biopsy settings was assessed using Fisher's exact test, as well as univariable (UVA) and multivariable (MVA) logistic regression.  Results:   In 543 men in whom a prostatectomy was performed, a nodal dissection was also available in 340 (63%), and 37 (10.9%) of them had pN1 disease. ISUP grade, stage and CC/IDC were significantly associated with pN1 (p < 0.001). UVA regression showed grade (p < 0.001, odds ratio [OR]: 5.85), CC/IDC (p = 0.003, OR: 14.06) and T stage (p = 0.004, OR: 61.94) associated with pN1 as did MVA regression: grade (p = 0.010, OR: 2.81), CC/IDC (p = 0.015, OR: 5.12) and T stage (p = 0.016, OR: 30.38). In 275 patients with matched biopsies, a nodal dissection was performed in 197 (71.6%) and 20 (10.2%) patients had pN1 disease.

Breast, prostate and lung accounted for the majority of primary types. GI cancers were the fourth most common primary type. There were proportional increases in breast and lung, with proportional decreases in prostate. The spine was the major metastatic site.

As an ideal plan of CaP brachytherapy cannot be created, it is necessary to identify a reliable tool to optimise the parameters of HDR-MB. This paper applies a multilayer artificial neural network (MANN) and a genetic algorithm (GA) to optimise brachytherapy parameters based on an individual dose-volumetric analysis.  Methods:   Patients with localised CaP of various risks were treated with HDR-MB. Consecutive levels of the biochemical control parameter (prostate specific antigen (PSA) nadir) have been collected after completion of HDR-MB in the range 2-9 years. The Kaplan-Meier regression analysis of biochemical-free survival (BFS) was applied. The clinical risk of recurrent CaP (RCaP), the therapy dose (TD), TD coverage index (CI100%) and PSA nadir were modelled using the MANN and GA.  Results:   In the low-risk group, BFS was achieved in 100% of treated patients, while in the group of patients with high risk, BFS was achieved in 95.8% of treated patients.

Methods:   We built the source model with planning data from 108 patients previously treated with VMAT for prostate cancer. For the transfer learning, we selected patient cases planned with three different styles, 14-29 cases per style, in the same institution and 20 cases treated in a different institution to adapt the source model to four target models in total. We compared the dose distributions predicted by the source model and the target models with the corresponding clinical plan dose used for patient treatments and quantified the improvement in the prediction quality for the target models over the source model using the Dice similarity coefficients (DSC) of 0% to 100% isodose volumes and the dose-volume-histogram (DVH) parameters of the planning target volume and the organs-at-risk.  Results:   The source model accurately predicts dose distributions for plans generated in the same source style, but performs sub-optimally for the three different internal and one external target styles, with the mean DSC ranging between 0.81-0.94 and 0.82-0.91 for the internal and the external styles, respectively. With transfer learning, the target model predictions improved the mean DSC to 0.88-0.95 and 0.92-0.96 for the internal and the external styles, respectively. Target model predictions significantly improved the accuracy of the DVH parameter predictions to within 1.6%.  Conclusion:   We demonstrated the problem of model generalizability for DL-based dose prediction and the feasibility of using transfer learning to solve this problem. With 14-29 cases per style, we successfully adapted the source model into several different practice styles.

The J-CAPRA score threshold was adjusted for intermediate (modified J-CAPRA score 3-5) and high-risk (modified J-CAPRA score ≥6) groups in M1 patients. Using J-CaP database, validation analysis showed that overall survival, prostate cancer-specific survival, and progression-free survival of modified intermediate and high-risk groups were comparable to those of original J-CAPRA (p > 0.05) with Cohen's coefficient of 0.65.

Patients and methods:   Men on an AS programme at a single tertiary hospital (London, UK) between 2003 and 2018 with confirmed low-intermediate-risk PCa, Gleason Grade Group <3, clinical stage <T3 and a diagnostic prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level of <20 ng/mL. This cohort included men diagnosed by transrectal ultrasonography guided (12-14 cores) or transperineal (median 32 cores) biopsy. Multivariate Cox hazards regression analysis was undertaken to determine (i) risk of upgrading, (ii) clinical or radiological suspicion of disease progression, and (iii) transitioning to active treatment. Suspicion of disease progression was defined as any biopsy upgrading, >30% positive cores, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) Likert score >3/T3 or PSA level of >20 ng/mL. Conversion to treatment included radical or hormonal treatment.  Results:   Among the 460 eligible patients, 23% had negative follow-up biopsy findings. The median follow-up was 62 months, with one to two repeat biopsies and two MRIs per patient during that period. Negative biopsy findings at first repeat biopsy were associated with decreased risk of converting to active treatment (hazard ration [HR] 0.18, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.09-0.37; P < 0.001), suspicion of disease progression (HR 0.56, 95% CI: 0.34-0.94; P = 0.029), and upgrading (HR 0.48, 95% CI 0.23-0.99; P = 0.047).

Herein, we examine the capabilities of BBN-modified HPMA copolymers to target the GRPR.  Methods:   Four positive, four negative, and two zwitterionic BBN HPMA copolymer conjugates of varying peptide content and charge were synthesized. In vitro and in vivo studies were conducted in a GRPR-overexpressing prostate cancer cell line (PC-3) and a normal CF-1 mouse model, respectively.  Results:   Cellular uptake of the conjugates were found to be charge and BBN density dependent. The positively-charged conjugates illustrated a direct relationship between the extent of cellular internalization, ranging from 0.7 to 20%, and BBN-incorporation density. The negative and zwitterionic conjugates showed low PC-3 uptake values. Blocking studies confirmed the GRPR-targeting effect of the positively-charged constructs. In vivo studies of the positively-charged copolymers resulted in rapid blood clearance by the mononuclear phagocyte system (MPS)-associated tissues (e.g., liver and spleen).  Conclusion:   Positively-charged BBN-HPMA copolymer conjugates demonstrated good GRPR-targeting and internalization in vitro.

We compared DDR dynamics between prostate cancer cell lines, PDEs and xenograft derived explants (XDEs) following treatment with IR (2Gy) either alone or in combination with pharmacological modulators of DDR.

By examining kinetics of resolution of IR-induced foci, we have shown that DDR in prostate PDEs (complete resolution in 8 h) is much faster than in prostate cancer cell lines (<50% resolution in 8 h). The transcriptional profile of DDR genes following 2Gy IR appears to be distinct between PDEs and cell lines.

Patients and methods:   For 38,960 men diagnosed with PCa without distant metastases from 2006 to 2015 data from the Norwegian Prostate Cancer Registry and a national radiotherapy database (NoRadBase) was analyzed. Overall survival and PCa-specific mortality were described comparing EQD-2 < 74 Gy (""low-dose"") with EQD-2 ≥ 74 Gy (""escalated dose"").  Results:   Use of Def-RT decreased (27-24%) whereas the proportion of radical prostatectomies (RPs) increased (31-38%). In high-risk patients the use of RP doubled (18-36%), while the proportion of Def-RT remained stable (about 35%). Before 2010, almost a quarter of patients received low-dose Def-RT with gradual increase of escalated Def-RT thereafter. Escalated Def-RT was associated with significantly more favorable 10-year PCa-specific mortality (4.4% [95% CI: 2.7-10.7%]) than observed after low-dose Def- RT (8.8% [95% CI: 6.2-9.8%), with the most beneficial effects in high-risk patients. Our analyses indicated the need to expand the NoRadBase by consensus-based quality measures.  Conclusion:   In this nationwide cohort, the overall use of Def-RT decreased slightly. In high-risk patients the provision of Def-RT remained stable and was accompanied by doubling of patients with RP and reduction of a ""no curative treatment"" strategy. Escalated dose Def-RT significantly reduced 10-year PCa-specific mortality compared to low-dose Def-RT.

Pomegranate and its extracts have shown antiproliferative and proapoptotic effects in cell lines and animal models, but its effect on human prostate cancer as a target tissue remain unclear. Objectives of this trial include pomegranate's ability to alter serum and prostate tissue biomarkers and the ability of an active surveillance cohort to adhere to a chemoprevention trial for 1 year.  Methods:   Men with organ-confined, favorable-risk PCa on AS were randomly assigned to receive pomegranate fruit extract (PFE) 1000 mg (n = 15) or placebo (n = 15) once daily for twelve months. Prostate biopsies were performed at study entry and upon completion of the 1-year intervention. Plasma and urinary biomarkers were analyzed utilizing immunoassays and HPLC. Tissue proteins were assessed by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and measured by automated quantitation.  Results:   PFE was well-tolerated with no significant toxicities. One patient withdrew before study initiation and 29 completed the 1-year intervention. No differences in plasma insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) levels, prostate-specific antigen doubling time, or biopsy kinetics were observed. Metabolites including urolithin A and urolithin A-gluc were detected more frequently in the PFE arm in both urine and plasma (p < .001 and p = .006, respectively). IHC analyses revealed reductions from baseline in 8-OHdG (a DNA damage marker) (p = .01) and androgen receptor expression (p = .04) in prostate tumor associated with PFE treatment.  Conclusion:   PFE administration for 12-month was well-tolerated and the protocol followed in an active surveillance population. Analyses suggest that PFE contains bioactive compounds capable of altering biomarkers involving oxidative stress and androgen signaling in prostate tumor and normal-appearing adjacent tissue.

In January 2018, we amended our prostate cancer clinical pathway (CP) to facilitate adoption of mHF-EBRT. Herein, we analyze patterns of care and changes in mHF-EBRT use after the CP modification.  Methods:   Our prostate CP was amended in January 2018 to make mHF-EBRT the recommended treatment for patients with low- and intermediate-risk prostate cancer pursuing curative EBRT monotherapy. Normal-tissue dose constraints accompanied the CP modification to guide planning. Use of mHF-EBRT from 2015 to 2017 was compared with use in 2018 after the CP modification, using the Cochran-Armitage test for trend. Predictors of mHF-EBRT use and adherence to dose constraints were analyzed with binary logistic regression.  Results:   In 560 patients treated with EBRT monotherapy, mHF-EBRT use increased from 3.7% in 2015-2017 to 85.6% in 2018 (P < .001), whereas conventionally fractionated EBRT (CF-EBRT) use decreased from 96.3% to 14.4% (P < .001).

We present our preliminary results on the clinical utilization of MRI-guided adaptive radiotherapy (MRgRT) for prostate cancer patients with the workflow, dosimetric parameters, toxicities and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response.  Methods:   50 prostate cancer patients treated with ultra-hypofractionation were included in the study. Treatment was performed with intensity-modulated radiation therapy (step and shoot) technique and daily plan adaptation using MRgRT. The SBRT consisted of 36.25 Gy in 5 fractions with a 7.25 Gy fraction size. The time for workflow steps was documented. Patients were followed for the acute and late toxicities and PSA response.  Results:   The median follow-up for our cohort was 10 months (range between 3 and 29 months). The median age was 73.5 years (range between 50 and 84 years). MRgRT was well tolerated by all patients. Acute genitourinary (GU) toxicity rate of Grade 1 and Grade 2 was 28 and 36%, respectively. Only 6% of patients had acute Grade 1 gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity and there was no Grade ≥ 2 GI toxicity. To date, late Grade 1 GU toxicity was experienced by 24% of patients, 2% of patients experienced Grade 2 GU toxicity and 6% of patients reported Grade 2 GI toxicity. Due to the short follow-up, PSA nadir has not been reached yet in our cohort.  Conclusion:   In conclusion, MRgRT represents a new method for delivering SBRT with markerless soft tissue visualization, online adaptive planning and real-time tracking. Our study suggests that ultra-hypofractionation has an acceptable acute and very low late toxicity profile.

Methods:   The SBRT-protocol consisted of a 35 Gy schedule delivered in 5 fractions. Herein, we present a dosimetric analysis between spacer and no-spacer patients. Furthermore, treatment tolerability and feasibility were preliminarily assessed according to clinicians-reported outcomes at the end of treatment and patient-reported outcomes measures (PROMs) in both arms. Toxicity and quality of life were assessed at baseline and after treatment using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v. 5.0, International Prostatic Symptoms Score, ICIQ-SF, IIEF-5, and EORTC-QLQ-C30 and PR-25 questionnaires.  Results:   120 plans (pre- and daily adaptive SBRT planning) were analyzed in 20 patients (10 patients in spacer group and 10 patients in no-spacer group) treated using 1.5T MR-guided adaptive SBRT. Statistically significant dosimetric advantages were observed in favor of the spacer insertion, improving the planning target volume coverage in terms of V33.2Gy >95% and planning target volume 37.5 Gy <2% mainly during daily-adapted SBRT. Also, rectum V32, V28 and V18Gy and bladder V35Gy <1 cc were significantly reduced in the spacer cohort. Concerning the PROMS, all questionnaires showed no difference between the pre- and post-SBRT evaluation in both arms, excepting the physical functioning item of EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire that was declined in the no-spacer group.

Recent discoveries have resulted in the development of clinical immune checkpoint inhibitors that are 'game-changers' for cancer immunotherapy. Here we show that eEF2K, an atypical protein kinase that negatively modulates the elongation stage of protein synthesis, promotes the synthesis of PD-L1, an immune checkpoint protein which helps cancer cells to escape from immunosurveillance. Ablation of eEF2K in prostate and lung cancer cells markedly reduced the expression levels of the PD-L1 protein. We show that eEF2K promotes the association of PD-L1 mRNAs with translationally active polyribosomes and that translation of the PD-L1 mRNA is regulated by a uORF (upstream open reading-frame) within its 5'-UTR (5'-untranslated region) which starts with a non-canonical CUG as the initiation codon. This inhibitory effect is attenuated by eEF2K thereby allowing higher levels of translation of the PD-L1 coding region and enhanced expression of the PD-L1 protein. Moreover, eEF2K-depleted cancer cells are more vulnerable to immune attack by natural killer cells. Therefore, control of translation elongation can modulate the translation of this specific mRNA, one which contains an uORF that starts with CUG, and perhaps others that contain a similar feature. Taken together, our data reveal that eEF2K regulates PD-L1 expression at the level of the translation of its mRNA by virtue of a uORF in its 5'-region. This, and other roles of eEF2K in cancer cell biology (e.g. in cell survival and migration), may be exploited for the design of future therapeutic strategies.""","""['Yu Wu#', 'Jianling Xie#', 'Xin Jin', 'Roman V Lenchine', 'Xuemin Wang', 'Danielle M Fang', 'Zeyad D Nassar', 'Lisa M Butler', 'Jing Li', 'Christopher G Proud']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Biochem J""","""['eEF2K promotes PD-L1 stabilization through inactivating GSK3β in melanoma.', 'Eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase upregulates the expression of proteins implicated in cell migration and cancer cell metastasis.', 'Ablation of elongation factor 2 kinase enhances heat-shock protein 90 chaperone expression and protects cells under proteotoxic stress.', 'Regulation and roles of elongation factor 2 kinase.', 'Eukaryotic Elongation Factor 2 Kinase a Pharmacological Target to Regulate Protein Translation Dysfunction in Neurological Diseases.', 'SHFM1 deficiency suppresses esophageal squamous cell carcinomas progression via modulating NF‑κB signaling and enhancing nature killer cell‑mediated tumor surveillance.', 'Non-invasive plasma testing for CD274 UTR structural variations by next-generation sequencing in cancer.', 'Mutant p53 achieved Gain-of-Function by promoting tumor growth and immune escape through PHLPP2/AKT/PD-L1 pathway.', 'eEF2K promotes PD-L1 stabilization through inactivating GSK3β in melanoma.', 'Protein synthesis control in cancer: selectivity and therapeutic targeting.']"""

The PSMA binding affinities, biodistribution, and DNA-damaging capacities of these radiotracers have not yet been compared in detail. A major concern of PSMA-targeting radiotracers is the toxicity in other PSMA-expressing organs, such as the salivary glands, thus demanding careful evaluation of the most optimal and safest radiotracer. In this extensive preclinical study, we evaluated the clinically applied PSMA-targeting small molecule inhibitors DOTA-PSMA-617 (PSMA-617) and DOTAGA-PSMA-I&T (PSMA-I&T) and the PSMA nanobody DOTA-JVZ-007 (JVZ-007) using PSMA-expressing cell lines, a unique set of PCa patient-derived xenografts (PDX) and healthy human tissues.  Methods and results:   In vitro displacement studies on PSMA-expressing cells and cryosections of a PSMA-positive PDX revealed high and specific binding affinity for all three tracers labeled with lutetium-177 with IC50 values in the nanomolar range. Interestingly, [177Lu]Lu-JVZ-007 could not be displaced by PSMA-617 or PSMA-I&T, suggesting that this tracer targets an alternative binding site. Autoradiography assays on cryosections of human salivary and renal tissues revealed [177Lu]Lu-PSMA-617 to have the lowest binding to these healthy organs compared with [177Lu]Lu-PSMA-I&T. In vivo biodistribution assays confirmed the in vitro results with comparable tumor uptake of [177Lu]Lu-PSMA-617 and [177Lu]Lu-PSMA-I&T at all timepoints, resulting in induction of similar levels of DNA double-strand breaks in the tumors.

Summary answer:   Leydig cell number significantly decreases in parallel with INSL3 expression and Sertoli cell number in aged men, yet the in vitro Leydig cell androgenic potential does not appear to be compromised by advancing age.  What is known already:   There is extensive evidence that ageing is accompanied by decline in serum testosterone levels, a general involution of testis morphology and reduced spermatogenic function. A few studies have previously addressed single features of the human aged testis phenotype one at a time, but mostly in tissue from patients with prostate cancer.  Study design, size, duration:   This comprehensive study examined testis morphology, Leydig cell and Sertoli cell number, steroidogenic enzyme expression, INSL3 expression and androgen secretion by testicular fragments in vitro. The majority of these endpoints were concomitantly evaluated in the same individuals that all displayed complete spermatogenesis.  Participants/materials, setting, methods:   Testis biopsies were obtained from 15 heart beating organ donors (age range: 19-85 years) and 24 patients (age range: 19-45 years) with complete spermatogenesis. Leydig cells and Sertoli cells were counted following identification by immunohistochemical staining of specific cell markers. Gene expression analysis of INSL3 and steroidogenic enzymes was carried out by qRT-PCR. Secretion of 17-OH-progesterone, dehydroepiandrosterone, androstenedione and testosterone by in vitro cultured testis fragments was measured by LC-MS/MS. All endpoints were analysed in relation to age.  Main results and the role of chance:   Increasing age was negatively associated with Leydig cell number (R = -0.49; P < 0.01) and concomitantly with the Sertoli cell population size (R= -0.55; P < 0.001). A positive correlation (R = 0.57; P < 0.001) between Sertoli cell and Leydig cell numbers was detected at all ages, indicating that somatic cell attrition is a relevant cellular manifestation of human testis status during ageing. INSL3 mRNA expression (R= -0.52; P < 0.05) changed in parallel with Leydig cell number and age. Importantly, steroidogenic capacity of Leydig cells in cultured testis tissue fragments from young and old donors did not differ. Consistently, age did not influence the mRNA expression of steroidogenic enzymes. The described changes in Leydig cell phenotype with ageing are strengthened by the fact that the different age-related effects were mostly evaluated in tissue from the same men.  Limitations, reasons for caution:   In vitro androgen production analysis could not be correlated with in vivo hormone values of the organ donors. In addition, the number of samples was relatively small and there was scarce information about the concomitant presence of potential confounding variables.  Wider implications of the findings:   This study provides a novel insight into the effects of ageing on human Leydig cell status. The correlation between Leydig cell number and Sertoli cell number at any age implies a connection between these two cell types, which may be of particular relevance in understanding male reproductive disorders in the elderly. However aged Leydig cells do not lose their in vitro ability to produce androgens. Our data have implications in the understanding of the physiological role and regulation of intratesticular sex steroid levels during the complex process of ageing in humans.

MiRNAs are small non-coding RNAs which post-transcriptionally regulate gene expression and which are involved in tumour development and progression as oncogenes or tumour suppressors. Although many genes could be confirmed as targets for deregulated miRNAs, the impact of differentially expressed miRNA and their regulatory target genes on prostate tumour development and progression are not fully understood yet. We could validate RBMS1, a barely described RNA-binding protein, as a new target gene for oncogenic miR-106b, which was identified as an induced miRNA in PCa. Further analysis revealed a loss of RBMS1 expression in prostate tumours compared to corresponding normal tissue. Overexpression of RBMS1 in DU145 and LNCaP prostate cancer cells resulted in diminished cell proliferation, colony forming ability as well as in retarded gap closing. Our results demonstrate for the first time a miR-106b dependent downregulation of RBMS1 in prostate carcinoma.

Objective:   Combining multiple imputation with age and delay adjustment, we provide an up-to-date, comprehensive assessment of US prostate cancer incidence trends by stage and race.  Design, setting, and participants:   From Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results (SEER)-18, 774 240 prostate cancer cases were diagnosed during 2004-2017.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Multiple imputation assigned prostate cancer stage to the 4.7% of cases with missing stage, which varied by year and race-ethnicity. SEER delay factors adjusted case counts to anticipated future data corrections. Twenty datasets were imputed, and Rubin's rules were used for summary estimation. Overall and stage-specific rates were estimated and stratified by race and age group. Joinpoint software identified significant temporal changes and estimated annual percentage changes. We compared these estimates without multiple imputation and delay adjustment.  Results and limitations:   Metastatic prostate cancer incidence increased during 2011-2017, with an annual percentage change of 5.5. This was followed by increases in localized and regional disease since 2014. Non-Hispanic black men continued to have the highest incidence, especially for metastatic disease. The increasing rate of metastatic prostate cancer in non-Hispanic white men aged 50-74 yr accelerated recently, and the incidence was 56% higher in 2017 than in 2004. Rates without multiple imputation and delay adjustment were quantitatively and qualitatively different. This observational study is unable to assign causes to observed changes in prostate cancer incidence.  Conclusions:   Multiple imputation and delay adjustment are essential for portraying accurately stage- and race-specific prostate cancer incidence as clinical practice evolves.  Patient summary:   In the USA, diagnosis of prostate cancer that has spread to distant sites (metastatic disease) continues to increase. Black men continue to have higher risks of being diagnosed with metastatic prostate cancer than other race-ethnicities.""","""['Michael B Cook', 'Lauren M Hurwitz', 'Ashley M Geczik', 'Eboneé N Butler']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Eur Urol""","""['Monitoring Prostate Cancer Incidence Trends: Value of Multiple Imputation and Delay Adjustment to Discern Disparities in Stage-specific Trends.', 'Changing Incidence of Metastatic Prostate Cancer by Race and Age, 1988-2015.', 'Past, Current, and Future Incidence Rates and Burden of Metastatic Prostate Cancer in the United States.', 'Rates and trends in stage-specific prostate cancer incidence by age and race/ethnicity, 2000-2017.', 'Prostate cancer epidemiology in the United States.', 'Racial Differences in Prostate Cancer Characteristics and Cancer-Specific Mortality: An Overview.', 'Epidemiological trends for functional pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors: A study combining multiple imputation with age adjustment.', 'Opportunities for Achieving the Cancer Moonshot Goal of a 50% Reduction in Cancer Mortality by 2047.', 'Systemic Inflammation Indices and Association with Prostate Cancer Survival in a Diverse Patient Cohort.', 'Identification of genes and cellular response factors related to immunotherapy response in mismatch repair-proficient colorectal cancer: a bioinformatics analysis.', 'Second Primary Malignancy Risk in Multiple Myeloma from 1975 to 2018.']"""

Recently, published results from clinical studies using a new PSMA-targeting PET imaging agent, [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-093 ([68Ga]Ga-HBED-CC-O-carboxymethyl-Tyr-CO-NH-Glu), support the development of this agent for the diagnosis of prostate cancer. In this study, the HBED-CC chelating group in PSMA-093 was replaced by stereoselective (R)- or (S)-DOTAGA. This chelating group serves not only for chelating 68Ga but is also amendable for complexing other radioactive metals for radionuclide therapy. The corresponding optically pure (R)- and (S)-[68Ga/177Lu]-DOTAGA derivatives, (R)-[68Ga/177Lu]-13 and (S)-[68Ga/177Lu]-13, were successfully prepared. Comparison of radiolabeling, binding affinity, cell uptake, and biodistribution between the two isomers was performed. Radiolabeling of (R)-[177Lu]Lu-13 and (S)-[177Lu]Lu-13 at 50 °C suggested that rates of complex formation were time-dependent and the formation of (S)-[177Lu]Lu-13 was distinctly faster. The rates of complex formation for the corresponding 68Ga agents were comparable between structural isomers. The natGa and natLu equivalents showed high binding PSMA affinity (IC50 = 24-111 nM), comparable to that of the parent agent, [natGa]Ga-PSMA-093 (IC50 = 34.0 nM). Results of cell uptake and biodistribution studies in PSMA-expressing PC3-PIP tumor-bearing mice appeared to show no difference between the labeled (R)- and (S)-isomers. This is the first time that a pair of [68Ga/177Lu]-(R)- and (S)-DOTAGA isomers of PSMA agents were evaluated. Results of biological studies between the isomers showed no noticeable difference; however, the distinctions on the rate of Lu complex formation should be considered in the development of new 177Lu-DOTAGA-based radionuclide therapy agents in the future.""","""['Ruiyue Zhao', 'Karl Ploessl', 'Zhihao Zha', 'Seokrye Choi', 'David Alexoff', 'Lin Zhu', 'Hank F Kung']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Mol Pharm""","""['New PSMA-Targeting Ligands: Transformation from Diagnosis (Ga-68) to Radionuclide Therapy (Lu-177).', 'Synthesis and evaluation of a novel urea-based 68Ga-complex for imaging PSMA binding in tumor.', '68Ga- and 177Lu-Labeled PSMA I&T: Optimization of a PSMA-Targeted Theranostic Concept and First Proof-of-Concept Human Studies.', 'Prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA) ligands for diagnosis and therapy of prostate cancer.', 'Radiolabeled enzyme inhibitors and binding agents targeting PSMA: Effective theranostic tools for imaging and therapy of prostate cancer.', 'Preclinical Characterization of a Stabilized Gastrin-Releasing Peptide Receptor Antagonist for Targeted Cancer Theranostics.', 'N-Alkyl Carbamoylimidazoles as Versatile Synthons for the Synthesis of Urea-Based PSMA Inhibitors.', 'PSMA-Targeting Imaging and Theranostic Agents-Current Status and Future Perspective.', 'Separation of 44Sc from 44Ti in the Context of A Generator System for Radiopharmaceutical Purposes with the Example of 44ScSc-PSMA-617 and 44ScSc-PSMA-I&T Synthesis.']"""

Osteoclast-targeting drugs intended to prevent skeletal-related events associated with prostate cancer bone metastases do not prolong overall survival. Improved understanding of the bone-derived factors that contribute to prostate cancer osteoblastic bone metastases is required to design treatments that will improve morbidities and overall survival. Activated osteoblasts stimulate prostate cancer growth in bone. In this study, we report that prostate cancer conditioned medium (CM) promoted bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)-2, -4 and -7 production and the expression of osteogenic transcription factors Runx2 and osterix in osteoblasts. Treating the prostate cancer CM with antibody against CCN3 (nephroblastoma-overexpressed), a cysteine-rich protein that belongs to the CCN family, reduced all of these increases. Incubation of osteoblasts with CCN3 facilitated phosphorylation of GSK3β and β-catenin. GSK3β and β-catenin inhibitors or siRNAs all abolished CCN3-induced promotion of BMPs, Runx2 and osterix expression in osteoblasts.

Here, we demonstrate a technique for the detection and selective isolation of target cells encapsulated in microdroplets in single-cell format. A sample containing a mixed population of cells with fluorescently labelled target cells can be focused using a sheath fluid to direct cells in single file toward a droplet junction, wherein the cells are encapsulated inside droplets. The droplets containing the cells migrate toward the centre of the channel owing to non-inertial lift force. The cells present in the droplets are studied and characterised based on forward scatter (FSC), side scatter (SSC), and fluorescence (FL) signals. The FL signals from the target cells can be used to activate a selective isolation module based on electro-coalescence, using suitable electronics and a program to sort droplets containing the target cells in single-cell format from droplets containing background cells. We demonstrated the detection and isolation of target cells (cancer cells: HeLa and DU145) from mixed populations of cells, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) + cervical cancer cells (HeLa) and PBMC + human prostate cancer cells (DU145), at a concentration range of 104-106 ml-1 at 300 cells per s.

To illuminate the comprehensive role of PSA in PrCa, we performed an isobaric tag for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ)-based proteomic analysis to explore the proteomic change induced by PSA knockdown. Among 121 differentially expressed proteins, 67 proteins were up-regulated, while 54 proteins down-regulated. Bioinformatics analysis was used to explore the mechanism through which PSA exerts influence on PrCa. Protein-protein interaction analysis showed that PSA may mediate POTEF, EPHA3, RAD51C, HPGD and MCM4 to promote the initiation and progression of PrCa.

The aim of this study was to introduce a ""diagnosis and handling of PCa in one day"" concept, accelerating the handling of PCa patients by giving diagnostic results within 3 hours with the help of prostate cytology. Standard histology served as the control.  Material and methods:   After multiparametric MRI, prostate biopsies were taken and one was used for imprint cytology on superfrost slides. The cytology samples were stained by p63/p504s double staining, a standard stain in PCa histology, followed by on-site interpretation.  Results:   Among 129 patients, 39.5% had a prior history of PCa and were either under active surveillance or had been treated by focal therapy. The others came with suspicion of PCa. In 80.8% of the cases, the cytology and histology results agreed. In low-grade PCa the detection with cytology was more difficult with 72.4% agreement, whereas for intermediate and high-grade PCa the concordance with histology was 81.8 and 90%, respectively. False positive cases were less than 4.0%.  Conclusion:   Cytology of the prostate is unusual, but our study is the first to show it is feasible and gives immediate results that are satisfactory, especially in more aggressive cases. Immunocytology can be easily integrated into the laboratory. Our technique allows quicker handling of PCa, which can soften the psychological impact on men waiting for the diagnosis of PCa.""","""['Eva Compérat', 'Raphaele Renard-Penna', 'Valérie Ondet', 'Géraldine Cancel-Tassin', 'Olivier Cussenot']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Cytopathology""","""['Comparison of the basal cell-specific markers, 34betaE12 and p63, in the diagnosis of prostate cancer.', 'Basal cell cocktail (34betaE12 + p63) improves the detection of prostate basal cells.', 'Expression and diagnostic utility of alpha-methylacyl-CoA-racemase (P504S) in foamy gland and pseudohyperplastic prostate cancer.', 'Multiparametric MRI in detection and staging of prostate cancer.', 'Alpha-methylacyl CoA racemase (P504S): overview and potential uses in diagnostic pathology as applied to prostate needle biopsies.']"""

Adherence to these guidelines is variable.  Objective:   To determine whether the use of a ""Best Practice Advisory"" (BPA) intervention within the electronic medical record (EMR) system can alter the rate of PSA screening in men ≥ 70 years of age.  Design:   This is an interventional study spanning the years 2013 through 2017, in men ≥ 70 years of age in Kaiser Permanente Northern California with no prior history of prostate cancer. The BPA intervention was activated in the EMR system on October 15, 2015, with no prior notice or education.  Setting:   Integrated healthcare system including all Kaiser Permanente Northern California facilities.  Participants:   A population-based sample that included all male members ≥ 70 years of age without a history of prostate cancer.  Main measures:   The main outcome was the rate of PSA testing in men ≥ 70 years of age. We compared the rates of PSA testing between the pre-BPA period (January 1, 2013-October 14, 2015) and the post-BPA period (October 15, 2015-December 31, 2017). An interrupted time series analysis of PSA ordering rates was performed.  Key results:   Following the 2015 BPA intervention, screening rates substantially declined from 36.0 per 100 person-years to 14.9 per 100 person-years (rate ratio = 0.415; 95% CI: 0.410-0.419). The effect of the BPA was comparable among all patient races and ordering provider specialties. The interrupted time series analysis showed a rapid, large, and sustained drop in the rate of PSA ordering, and much less temporal variation in test ordering after activation of the BPA.  Conclusion:   Following activation of a BPA within the EMR, the rates of inappropriate PSA testing significantly declined by 58.5% in men ≥ 70 years of age and temporal variation was reduced.""","""['Joseph Presti Jr', 'Stacey Alexeeff', 'Brandon Horton', 'Stephanie Prausnitz', 'Andrew L Avins']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""J Gen Intern Med""","""['Changes in Prostate Cancer Presentation Following the 2012 USPSTF Screening Statement: Observational Study in a Multispecialty Group Practice.', 'Prostate cancer screening practices in a large, integrated health system: 2007-2014.', 'Changes in Prostate-Specific Antigen Testing Relative to the Revised US Preventive Services Task Force Recommendation on Prostate Cancer Screening.', 'The effect of the USPSTF PSA screening recommendation on prostate cancer incidence patterns in the USA.', 'Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA)-Based Population Screening for Prostate Cancer: An Evidence-Based Analysis.', 'Responding to the Call: a New JGIM Area of Emphasis for Implementation and Quality Improvement Sciences.']"""

Therefore, race/ethnicity-matched controls are needed to distinguish the impact of illness on job loss from secular trends METHODS: Surveys were administered during and 4-month post-completion of breast cancer treatment. Patients were pre-diagnosis employed women aged 18-64, undergoing treatment for stage I-III breast cancers, who spoke English, Chinese, Korean, or Spanish. Each patient was asked to: (1) nominate peers who were surveyed in a corresponding timeframe (active controls), (2) report a friend's work status at baseline and follow-up (passive controls). Both types of controls were healthy, employed at baseline, and shared the nominating patient's race/ethnicity, language, and age. The primary outcome was number of evaluable patient-control pairs by type of control. A patient-control pair was evaluable if work status at follow-up was reported for both individuals.  Results:   Of the 180 patients, 25% had evaluable active controls (45 patient-control pairs); 84% had evaluable passive controls (151 patient-control pairs).

AR-low/negative (ARL/-) CRPC subtypes have recently been characterized and cannot be targeted by hormonal therapies, resulting in poor prognosis. RNA-binding protein (RBP)/helicase DDX3 (DEAD-box helicase 3 X-linked) is a key component of stress granules (SG) and is postulated to affect protein translation. Here, we investigated DDX3-mediated posttranscriptional regulation of AR mRNA (messenger RNA) in CRPC. Using patient samples and preclinical models, we objectively quantified DDX3 and AR expression in ARL/- CRPC. We utilized CRPC models to identify DDX3:AR mRNA complexes by RNA immunoprecipitation, assess the effects of DDX3 gain/loss-of-function on AR expression and signaling, and address clinical implications of targeting DDX3 by assessing sensitivity to AR-signaling inhibitors (ARSI) in CRPC xenografts in vivo. ARL/- CRPC expressed abundant AR mRNA despite diminished levels of AR protein. DDX3 protein was highly expressed in ARL/- CRPC, where it bound to AR mRNA. Consistent with a repressive regulatory role, DDX3 localized to cytoplasmic puncta with SG marker PABP1 in CRPC. While induction of DDX3-nucleated SGs resulted in decreased AR protein expression, inhibiting DDX3 was sufficient to restore 1) AR protein expression, 2) AR signaling, and 3) sensitivity to ARSI in vitro and in vivo. Our findings implicate the RBP protein DDX3 as a mechanism of posttranscriptional regulation for AR in CRPC.

However, due to a lack of methods to measure and localize protease activity directly within the tissue microenvironment, the design of protease-activated agents has been necessarily empirical, yielding suboptimal results when translated to patients. To address the need for spatially resolved protease activity profiling in cancer, we developed a new class of in situ probes that can be applied to fresh-frozen tissue sections in a manner analogous to immunofluorescence staining. These activatable zymography probes (AZP) detected dysregulated protease activity in human prostate cancer biopsy samples, enabling disease classification. AZPs were leveraged within a generalizable framework to design conditional cancer diagnostics and therapeutics and showcased in the Hi-Myc mouse model of prostate cancer, which models features of early pathogenesis. Multiplexed screening against barcoded substrates yielded a peptide, S16, that was robustly and specifically cleaved by tumor-associated metalloproteinases in the Hi-Myc model. In situ labeling with an AZP incorporating S16 revealed a potential role of metalloproteinase dysregulation in proliferative, premalignant Hi-Myc prostatic glands. Systemic administration of an in vivo imaging probe incorporating S16 perfectly classified diseased and healthy prostates, supporting the relevance of ex vivo activity assays to in vivo translation. We envision AZPs will enable new insights into the biology of protease dysregulation in cancer and accelerate the development of conditional diagnostics and therapeutics for multiple cancer types. SIGNIFICANCE: Visualization of protease activity within the native tissue context using AZPs provides new biological insights into protease dysregulation in cancer and guides the design of conditional diagnostics and therapeutics.""","""['Ava P Soleimany#', 'Jesse D Kirkpatrick#', 'Susan Su', 'Jaideep S Dudani', 'Qian Zhong', 'Ahmet Bekdemir', 'Sangeeta N Bhatia']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Cancer Res""","""['Multispectral Photoacoustic Imaging of Tumor Protease Activity with a Gold Nanocage-Based Activatable Probe.', 'Monitoring protease activity in biological tissues using antibody prodrugs as sensing probes.', 'Activity-based probes for the study of proteases: recent advances and developments.', 'Novel Ex Vivo Zymography Approach for Assessment of Protease Activity in Tissues with Activatable Antibodies.', 'The Tumor Proteolytic Landscape: A Challenging Frontier in Cancer Diagnosis and Therapy.', 'Low protease activity in B cell follicles promotes retention of intact antigens after immunization.', 'Multiscale profiling of protease activity in cancer.', 'Protease Activity Analysis: A Toolkit for Analyzing Enzyme Activity Data.', 'Selective targeting of metastatic ovarian cancer using an engineered anthrax prodrug activated by membrane-anchored serine proteases.', 'Host protease activity classifies pneumonia etiology.']"""

Consequently, survivin is considered as an attractive target to develop new promising anticancer candidates. A series of novel 3-cyanopyridine derivatives was synthesized and assessed for their cytotoxic activity against three human cancer cell lines: prostate carcinoma (PC-3), breast cancer (MDA-MB-231) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2). In addition, their activities were evaluated in comparison with a standard anticancer drug 5-FU. Compounds 5c and 5e both exhibited promising cytotoxicity against all the tested cell lines; especially, 5e showed better cytotoxic effect than the reference drug 5-FU. In order to evaluate the safety of these compounds, they were tested on the normal cell line WI-38, revealing their toxic selectivity toward cancer cells over normal ones. Further studies were performed in order to understand their mechanism of action; we examined the ability of our promising compounds 5c and 5e to induce cell cycle arrest. Both resulted in a notable induction of cell cycle arrest at the G2/M phase, along with an increase in the DNA content in the pre-G1 phase, giving us an indication of the incidence of apoptosis. 5c and 5e were further subjected to additional study using Annexin V-FITC assay in order to evaluate their ability to induce apoptosis. The results showed a marked increase in the early and late apoptotic cells, as well as an increase in the percentage of necrosis. Furthermore, Western blotting assay was accomplished using different concentrations of 5c and 5e. The results revealed a striking reduction in survivin expression through proteasome-dependent survivin degradation in addition to a decrease in the expression of some other inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (IAP) family proteins: Livin, XIAP, and C-IAP1 in a concentration-dependent manner. A docking study of 5c and 5e compounds in the dimerization site of survivin was also performed, showing agreement with the in vitro anti-survivin activity.""","""['Rehab Sabour', 'Marwa F Harras', 'Omkulthom Mohamed Al Kamaly', 'Najla Altwaijry']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Molecules""","""['Design, synthesis, cytotoxicity screening and molecular docking of new 3-cyanopyridines as survivin inhibitors and apoptosis inducers.', 'Biological Activity, Apoptotic Induction and Cell Cycle Arrest of New Hydrazonoyl Halides Derivatives.', 'New cyanopyridine-based scaffold as PIM-1 inhibitors and apoptotic inducers: Synthesis and SARs study.', '2-Anilinopyrimidine derivatives: Design, synthesis, in vitro anti-proliferative activity, EGFR and ARO inhibitory activity, cell cycle analysis and molecular docking study.', 'Pro-Apoptotic Activity of Bioactive Compounds from Seaweeds: Promising Sources for Developing Novel Anticancer Drugs.', 'New pyridine and chromene scaffolds as potent vasorelaxant and anticancer agents.', 'Inhibitory effect of roburic acid in combination with docetaxel on human prostate cancer cells.']"""

Additional bioinformatics and literature data were applied for this selection process. In total, 115 malignant PCa and 79 adjacent normal tissue samples were examined using robust RT-qPCR assays specifically established for the circRNAs and their linear counterparts. Their diagnostic and prognostic potential was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic curves, Cox regressions, decision curve analyses, and C-statistic calculations of prognostic indices. The combination of circATXN10 and linSTIL showed a high discriminative ability between malignant and adjacent normal tissue PCa. The combination of linGUCY1A2, linNEAT1, and linSTIL proved to be the best predictive RNA-signature for BCR. The combination of this RNA signature with five established reference models based on only clinicopathological factors resulted in an improved predictive accuracy for BCR in these models.

The ESASr was categorized into physical and psychological symptom subscores and total symptom score, and each was classified as none to mild (0-3) or moderate to severe (4-10) based on intensity. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to evaluate the relationship between clinical characteristics and symptom scores.  Results:   We identified 1159 patients eligible for analysis, of whom 52.2% were men and median age was 68 years. There were 613, 192, 149, 111 and 94 patients with lung, colorectal, breast, prostate and pancreatic cancer, respectively.

We investigated whether age, body mass index (BMI), smoking status, physical inactivity, and family history of cancer modify the effect of daily aspirin use on colorectal, ovarian, breast, endometrial and aggressive prostate cancer risk.  Methods:   We pooled 423,495 individuals from two prospective, U.S.-based studies: the NIH-AARP Diet and Health Study (1995-2011) and the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial (1993-2009). Using Cox proportional hazards regression, we examined associations between daily aspirin use (≥ 5 days/week) and risk of colorectal, ovarian, breast, endometrial, and aggressive prostate cancer, overall and across strata of risk factors.  Results:   Daily aspirin use was associated with a 15% reduction in colorectal cancer risk (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.85, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.80-0.89). Risk reductions were generally consistent across strata of risk factors but attenuated with increasing BMI (p-interaction = 0.16).

We hypothesize that the Prostate Health Index has greater accuracy than prostate specific antigen for detection of Gleason grade group 2-5 prostate cancer. We estimated probability of overall and Gleason grade group 2-5 prostate cancer across previously established Prostate Health Index ranges and identified Prostate Health Index cutoffs that maximize specificity for Gleason grade group 2-5 prostate cancer with sensitivity >90%.  Materials and methods:   We recruited a ""cancer-free"" Black control cohort (135 patients) and a cohort of biopsy naïve Black men (158) biopsied for elevated prostate specific antigen. Descriptive statistics compared the prostate cancer cases and controls and the frequency of Gleason grade group 2-5 prostate cancer across Prostate Health Index scores. Receiver operating characteristics compared the discrimination of prostate specific antigen, Prostate Health Index and other prostate specific antigen related biomarkers. Sensitivity and specificity for Gleason grade group 2-5 prostate cancer detection were assessed at prostate specific antigen and Prostate Health Index thresholds alone and in series.  Results:   Of biopsied subjects 32.9% had Gleason grade group 2-5 prostate cancer. In Blacks with prostate specific antigen from 4.0-10.0 ng/ml, Prostate Health Index and prostate specific antigen had similar discrimination for Gleason grade group 2-5 prostate cancer (0.63 vs 0.57, p=0.27). In Blacks with prostate specific antigen ≤10.0, a threshold of prostate specific antigen ≥4.0 had 90.4% sensitivity for Gleason grade group 2-5 prostate cancer; a threshold of prostate specific antigen ≥4.0 with Prostate Health Index ≥35.0 in series avoided unnecessary biopsy in 33.0% of men but missed 17.3% of Gleason grade group 2-5 prostate cancer. Prostate specific antigen ≥4.0 with Prostate Health Index ≥28.0 in series spared biopsy in 17.9%, while maintaining 90.4% sensitivity of Gleason grade group 2-5 prostate cancer.

Therefore, to explore the diagnosis and treatment of prostate cancer, we investigated the effect of SIRT5 on prostate cancer. Sirtuin 5 was assessed by immunohistochemistry in 57 normal and cancerous prostate tissues. We found that the tissue expression levels of SIRT5 in patients with Gleason scores ≥7 were significantly different from those in patients with Gleason scores <7 (P < .05, R > 0). Further, mass spectrometry and pathway screening experiments showed that SIRT5 regulated the activity of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, which in turn modulated the expression of MMP9 and cyclin D1. Being a substrate of SIRT5, acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase 1 (ACAT1) was regulated by SIRT5. SIRT5 also regulated MAPK pathway activity through ACAT1. These results revealed that SIRT5 promoted the activity of the MAPK pathway through ACAT1, increasing the ability of prostate cancer cells to proliferate, migrate and invade. Overall, these results indicate that SIRT5 expression is closely associated with prostate cancer progression.

Our study is aimed at analyzing the prognostic value of NFE2L2 in pan-cancer and at revealing the relationship between NFE2L2 expression and tumor immunity. The present study revealed that NFE2L2 was abnormally expressed and significantly correlated with mismatch repair (MMR) gene mutation levels and DNA methyltransferase expression in human pan-cancer. In particular, pan-cancer survival analysis indicated that NFE2L2 expression was associated with adverse outcomes-overall survival (OS), disease-specific survival (DSS), and progression-free interval (PFI)-in adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC), brain lower grade glioma (LGG), and pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PAAD) patients. A positive relationship was also found between NFE2L2 expression and immune infiltration, including B cells, CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, neutrophils, macrophages, and dendritic cells, especially in breast invasive carcinoma (BRCA), colon adenocarcinoma (COAD), kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC), LGG, liver hepatocellular carcinoma (LIHC), and prostate adenocarcinoma (PRAD).

Methods:   The PCa dataset from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) was randomly separated into discovery and validation set. Patients in discovery set were divided into early BCR group and long-term survival group.

The LASSO Cox regression model was finally performed to filter the most useful prognostic CSC-associated genes for predicting early BCR.  Results:   By applying the LASSO Cox regression model, we built a thirteen-CSC-associated gene-based early BCR-predicting signature.

Non-Hodgkin lymphomas, also AIDS-related, increased in incidence until 2006/2007 and then declined-possibly as a result of availability of antiretroviral therapy. The trends reflect the changing lifestyles of this urban African population, as well as the consequences of the epidemic of HIV/AIDS and the availability of treatment with ARVs.

The point cloud matching network was trained using deformation field that was generated by finite element analysis. Therefore, the network implicitly models the underlying biomechanical constraint when performing point cloud matching. A total of 50 patients' datasets were used for the network training and testing. Alignment of prostate shapes after registration was evaluated using three metrics including Dice similarity coefficient (DSC), mean surface distance (MSD) and Hausdorff distance (HD). Internal point-to-point registration accuracy was assessed using target registration error (TRE). Jacobian determinant and strain tensors of the predicted deformation field were calculated to analyze the physical fidelity of the deformation field. On average, the mean and standard deviation were 0.94±0.02, 0.90±0.23 mm, 2.96±1.00 mm and 1.57±0.77 mm for DSC, MSD, HD and TRE, respectively.

Linear regression was utilized to examine trends in treatment with initial prostatectomy and trends in postoperative radiotherapy among treatment risk groups. Multivariable logistic regression was utilized to examine clinical-demographic variables associated with prostatectomy and postoperative radiotherapy.

Results:   In this study, we found that LINC00852 was highly expressed in prostate cancer tissues based on the TCGA database. Overexpression of LINC00852 mediated by lentivirus significantly reinforced the proliferation and colony formation abilities of prostate cancer cell linePC3. The migration and invasion capabilities were also augmented by overexpression of LINC00852. Flow cytometric analysis revealed that LINC00852 overexpression resulted in a decrease of cells in G0/G1 phase. Moreover, overexpression of LINC00852 affected the expression of epithelial-mesenchymal transition-related proteins.

Our results showed that the downregulation of RILP and upregulation of RILP methylation were identified in lung cancer tissues compared to normal healthy tissues. Downregulation of RILP was positively associated with lung cancer later stage (N3), smoking history, TP53 mutation, and poor prognosis, as well as inversely correlated with DNA (cytosine-5)-methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) expression. Demethylation treatment enhanced RILP expression in lung cancer cells, suggesting hypermethylation is responsible for RILP silencing in lung cancer.

However, identification of reliable prognostic factors is hampered by heterogeneous treatment regimens applied in previous studies. Hence, we sought clinical factors able to predict response and survival to PSMA-RLT in a homogenous group of patients, all receiving 7400 MBq every 4 weeks.  Patients and methods:   Data of 61 patients (mean age 71.6 ± 6.9 years, median basal PSA 70.7 [range 1.0-4890 μg/L]), pretreated with abiraterone/enzalutamide (75.4%) and docetaxel/cabazitaxel (68.9%), received three cycles of PSMA-RLT (mean 7321 ± 592 MBq) at four weekly intervals and were analyzed retrospectively. General medical conditions and laboratory parameters of every patients were regularly assessed. Response to therapy was based on PSA levels 1 month after the 3rd cycle. Binary logistic regression test and Kaplan-Meier estimates were used to evaluate predictors and overall survival (OS).  Results:   Forty-nine (80.3%) patients demonstrated a therapy response in terms of any PSA decline, while 21 (19.7%) patients showed increase or no changes in their PSA levels. Baseline hemoglobin (Hb) significantly predicted PSA reductions of ≥ 50% 4 weeks after receiving the 3rd PSMA-RLT (P = 0.01, 95% CI: 1.09-2.09) with an AUC of 0.68 (95% CI: 0.54-0.81). The levels of basal Hb and basal PSA were able to predict survival of patients, both P < 0.05 (relative risk 1.51 and 0.79, 95% CI: 1.09-2.09 and 0.43-1.46), respectively. In comparison to patients with reduced basal Hb, patients with normal basal Hb levels lived significantly longer (median survival not reached vs. 89 weeks, P = 0.016). Also, patients with basal PSA levels ≤ 650 μg/L had a significantly longer survival than patients with basal PSA levels > 650 μg/L (median survival not reached vs. 97 weeks, P = 0.031). Neither pretreatments with abiraterone/enzalutamide or docetaxel/cabazitaxel nor distribution of metastasis affected survival and rate of response to PSMA-RLT.

To this end, we have used sensitive glycomics and glycoproteomics to map the protein-, cell-, and tumor grade-specific N- and O-glycosylation in surgically removed PCa tissues spanning five histological grades (n = 10/grade) and tissues from patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia (n = 5). Quantitative glycomics revealed PCa grade-specific alterations of the oligomannosidic-, paucimannosidic-, and branched sialylated complex-type N-glycans, and dynamic remodeling of the sialylated core 1- and core 2-type O-glycome. Deep quantitative glycoproteomics identified ∼7400 unique N-glycopeptides from 500 N-glycoproteins and ∼500 unique O-glycopeptides from nearly 200 O-glycoproteins. With reference to a recent Tissue and Blood Atlas, our data indicate that paucimannosidic glycans of the PCa tissues arise mainly from immune cell-derived glycoproteins. Furthermore, the grade-specific PCa glycosylation arises primarily from dynamics in the cellular makeup of the PCa tumor microenvironment across grades involving increased oligomannosylation of prostate-derived glycoproteins and decreased bisecting GlcNAcylation of N-glycans carried by the extracellular matrix proteins. Furthermore, elevated expression of several oligosaccharyltransferase subunits and enhanced N-glycoprotein site occupancy were observed associated with PCa progression. Finally, correlations between the protein-specific glycosylation and PCa progression were observed including increased site-specific core 2-type O-glycosylation of collagen VI.

Meanwhile, there are questions about the reliability of STP dosimetry, with limited independent validations. In the present work, we analyzed 2 STP dosimetry methods and evaluated dose errors for several radiopharmaceuticals based on effective half-life distributions. Methods: We first challenged the common assumption that radiopharmaceutical effective half-lives across the population are gaussian-distributed (i.e., follow a normal distribution). Then, dose accuracy was estimated using 2 STP dosimetry methods for a wide range of potential post injection (p.i.) scan time points for different radiopharmaceuticals applied to neuroendocrine tumors and prostate cancer. The accuracy and limitations of each of the STP methods were discussed. Results: A lognormal distribution was more appropriate for capturing effective half-life distributions. The STP framework was promising for dosimetry of 177Lu-DOTATATE and for kidney dosimetry of different radiopharmaceuticals (errors < 30%). Meanwhile, for some radiopharmaceuticals, STP accuracy was compromised (e.g., in bone marrow and tumors for 177-labeled prostate-specific membrane antigen [PSMA])). The optimal SPECT scanning time for 177Lu-DOTATATE was approximately 72 h p.i., whereas 48 h p.i. was better for 177Lu-PSMA. Conclusion: Simplified STP dosimetry methods may compromise the accuracy of dose estimates, with some exceptions, such as for 177Lu-DOTATATE and for kidney dosimetry in different radiopharmaceuticals. Simplified personalized dosimetry in the clinic continues to be challenging. On the basis of our results, we make suggestions and recommendations for improved personalized dosimetry using simplified imaging schemes.""","""['Xinchi Hou', 'Julia Brosch', 'Carlos Uribe', 'Alessandro Desy', 'Guido Böning', 'Jean-Mathieu Beauregard', 'Anna Celler', 'Arman Rahmim']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""J Nucl Med""","""['Accuracy and uncertainty analysis of reduced time point imaging effect on time-integrated activity for 177Lu-DOTATATE PRRT in patients and clinically realistic simulations.', 'Accuracy and uncertainty analysis of reduced time point imaging effect on time-integrated activity for 177Lu-DOTATATE PRRT in clinical patients and realistic simulations.', 'Toward Single-Time-Point Image-Based Dosimetry of 177Lu-PSMA-617 Therapy.', 'Current Status of Radiopharmaceutical Therapy.', 'Implications of physics, chemistry and biology for dosimetry calculations using theranostic pairs.', 'Accuracy and uncertainty analysis of reduced time point imaging effect on time-integrated activity for 177Lu-DOTATATE PRRT in patients and clinically realistic simulations.', 'The use of single-timepoint images to link administered radioiodine activity (MBq) to a prescribed lesion radiation-absorbed dose (cGy): a regression-based prediction interval tool for the management of well-differentiated thyroid cancer patients.', 'Accuracy and uncertainty analysis of reduced time point imaging effect on time-integrated activity for 177Lu-DOTATATE PRRT in clinical patients and realistic simulations.', 'Single-time-point dosimetry using model selection and nonlinear mixed-effects modelling: a proof of concept.', 'A comparison of simplified protocols of personalized dosimetry in NEN patients treated by radioligand therapy (RLT) with 177LuLu-DOTATATE to favor its use in clinical practice.']"""

Prostate-specific membrane antigen PET (PSMA PET) may outperform MRI in GTV detection. However, visual GTV delineation underlies interobserver heterogeneity and is time consuming. The aim of this study was to develop a convolutional neural network (CNN) for automated segmentation of intraprostatic tumor (GTV-CNN) in PSMA PET. Methods: The CNN (3D U-Net) was trained on the 68Ga-PSMA PET images of 152 patients from 2 different institutions, and the training labels were generated manually using a validated technique. The CNN was tested on 2 independent internal (cohort 1: 68Ga-PSMA PET, n = 18 and cohort 2: 18F-PSMA PET, n = 19) and 1 external (cohort 3: 68Ga-PSMA PET, n = 20) test datasets. Accordance between manual contours and GTV-CNN was assessed with the Dice-Sørensen coefficient (DSC). Sensitivity and specificity were calculated for the 2 internal test datasets (cohort 1: n = 18, cohort 2: n = 11) using whole-mount histology. Results: The median DSCs for cohorts 1-3 were 0.84 (range: 0.32-0.95), 0.81 (range: 0.28-0.93), and 0.83 (range: 0.32-0.93), respectively. Sensitivities and specificities for the GTV-CNN were comparable with manual expert contours: 0.98 and 0.76 (cohort 1) and 1 and 0.57 (cohort 2), respectively. Computation time was around 6 s for a standard dataset.

Methods:   NMPCa patients with favorable intermediate to very high-risk features (National Comprehensive Cancer Network risk classification) treated with IMRT at our institution between September 2000 and May 2011 were analyzed retrospectively. Treatment consisted of high-dose IMRT (74-78 Gy/37-39 fractions) combined with 6 months of neoadjuvant hormonal therapy. Multivariable analysis using Fine and Gray's regression model was performed to evaluate whether age at initiation of IMRT was associated with biochemical failure (BF) and castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) progression.  Results:   A total of 367 patients were analyzed. The median follow-up period was 8.8 years after IMRT. The 5- and 10-year BF rates were 22.1 and 31.7%, and those of CRPC rates were 4.5 and 12.6%, respectively. Multivariable analysis revealed that a younger age (cut-off: 70 years old) at the initiation of IMRT was significantly correlated with both a higher BF rate (hazard ratio: 1.691, P= 0.0064) and higher CRPC rate (hazard ratio: 2.579, P = 0.0079).  Conclusions:   Younger men with NMPCa had increased risks of BF and CRPC after high-dose IMRT, and may benefit from more intensive treatments.

This study sought to determine the optimal number of targeted biopsy cores to obtain from a region of interest to maximize detection of clinically significant prostate cancer.  Materials and methods:   Consecutive patients undergoing MRI-targeted prostate biopsy at a single institution that newly implemented a targeted biopsy pathway from May 2017 to February 2018 were prospectively enrolled. Five biopsy cores were obtained and individually analyzed from each region rated ≥3 on PI-RADS v2.0 to determine the incremental diagnostic benefit of each additional targeted biopsy core. Variables associated with increasing Grade Group from the first to fifth biopsy core were assessed.  Results:   One hundred and four patients (79% for elevated PSA) were enrolled, 82% of which had a prior biopsy. Men with a PI-RADS >3 lesion were more likely to have pathologic upgrading with additional targeted biopsy cores (OR:4.76; 95% CI:2.34-9.70; P < 0.0001), particularly to Grade Group ≥2 (OR:5.16; 95% CI:2.17-12.29; P = 0.0002), compared to men with PI-RADS 3 lesions. Detection of clinically significant cancer increased from 26% to 44% to 52% when comparing the first, third, and fifth biopsy cores amongst men with a PI-RADS >3 lesion and from 1% to 4% to 9% for PI-RADS 3 lesions. Urinary retention was the most common complication, occurring in 6 (5.7%) patients.

This study aimed to explore how changing the website architecture (free choice vs. tunnelled) impacted engagement within a physical activity computer-tailored intervention targeting prostate cancer survivors.  Methods:   On a 2:2:1 ratio, 71 Australian prostate cancer survivors with local or locally advanced disease (mean age: 66.6 years ± 9.66) were randomised into either a free-choice (N = 27), tunnelled (N = 27) or minimal intervention control arm (N =17). The primary outcome was differences in usage of the physical activity self-monitoring and feedback modules between the two intervention arms. Differences in usage of other website components between the two intervention groups were explored as secondary outcomes. Further, secondary outcomes involving comparisons between all study groups (including the control) included usability, personal relevance, and behaviour change.  Results:   The average number of physical activity self-monitoring and feedback modules accessed was higher in the tunnelled arm (M 2.6 SD 1.3) compared to the free-choice arm (M 1.5 SD 1.4), p = 0.01. However, free-choice participants were significantly more likely to have engaged with the social support (p = 0.008) and habit formation (p = 0.003) 'once-off' modules compared to the standard tunnelled arm.

However, research regarding patient experiences while undergoing these treatments is scarce. The aim was to explore the perspectives of men when facing life-prolonging treatment of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.  Method:   Qualitative interviews were conducted with 16 men as they were starting, undergoing or had completed their first life-prolonging treatment. Interpretive description was used for analysis.  Results:   The results illuminate the complexity of facing life-prolonging treatment, with interlaced dimensions beyond just the outcome, and where the men described other dimensions of their lives in relation to the treatment. The results are presented as 4 themes; Considering treatment when the remainder of life is at stake, Preparing for the life-prolonging treatment after deciding to go through with it, Considering the prospect of the life-prolonging treatment not being successful and Reflecting on death and dying in the light of a life-limiting illness.  Conclusions:   The quality and content of the remainder of life are central for men when facing life-prolonging treatment of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. This is important when weighing desired treatment outcomes against side effects, and when reflecting upon whether going through with treatment would be worth it or not. The results illuminate the importance of encouraging men at this stage to express expectations, hopes and fears regarding the treatment and the future when considering life-prolonging treatments.

Automatic PCa classification of digitized H&E slides has been developed before, but no attempts have been made to classify PCa using additional tissue stains registered to H&E. In this paper, we demonstrate that using H&E, Ki67 and p63-stained (3-stain) tissue improves PCa classification relative to H&E alone. We also show that we can infer PCa-relevant Ki67 and p63 information from the H&E slides alone, and use it to achieve H&E-based PCa classification that is comparable to the 3-stain classification. Reported improvements apply to classifying benign vs. malignant tissue, and low grade (Gleason group 2) vs. high grade (Gleason groups 3,4,5) cancer. Specifically, we conducted four classification tasks using 333 tissue samples extracted from 231 radical prostatectomy patients: regression tree-based classification using either (i) 3-stain features, with a benign vs malignant area under the curve (AUC = 92.9%), or (ii) real H&E features and H&E features learned from Ki67 and p63 stains (AUC = 92.4%), as well as deep learning classification using either (iii) real 3-stain tissue patches (AUC = 94.3%) and (iv) real H&E patches and generated Ki67 and p63 patches (AUC = 93.0%) using a deep convolutional generative adversarial network. Classification performance was assessed with Monte Carlo cross validation and quantified in terms of the Area Under the Curve, Brier score, sensitivity, and specificity.

In the present study, the functions of ARHGAP29 were examined in four prostate cancer cell lines (22Rv1, LNCaP, DU145 and PC‑3) and it was revealed that upregulation of ARHGAP29 in LNCaP and DU145 cells with the lowest expression of ARHGAP29 promoted cell proliferation and invasion. Conversely, ARHGAP29 knockdown in PC‑3 cells with its highest expression level significantly reduced cell proliferation and invasion. In addition, immunohistochemistry of specimens from 133 patients who underwent radical prostatectomy was performed to investigate the clinical association between ARHGAP29 expression and prognosis in prostate cancer patients.

Besides, The Cancer Genome Atlas dataset was analyzed to validate the results in our meta-analysis via using Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis. The pooled results showed that high SNHG12 expression significantly indicated worse overall survival and recurrence-free survival. Tumor type, sample size, survival analysis method, and cutoff value did not alter SNHG12 prognosis value according to stratified analysis results. Additionally, higher expression of SNHG12 suggested unfavorable clinicopathological outcomes including larger tumor size, lymph node metastasis, distant metastasis, and advanced clinical stage. Online cross-validation in TCGA dataset further indicated that cancer patients with upregulated SNHG12 expression had worse overall survival and disease-free survival.

Materials and methods:   Using the GBD database, worldwide data aggregated from registries and health systems from 1990 to 2017 were filtered for LUTS/BPH diagnoses. Calculation of years lived with disability (YLD) were compared with other urological diseases. YLD were calculated by a standardized method using assigned disability weights. The GBD-defined sociodemographic index (SDI) was used to assess impact of LUTS/BPH by global SDI quintile.  Results:   Global Burden of Disease data over the 1990-2017 study period were summarized and global numbers and trends noted with other urological diseases for comparison. A total of 2 427 334 YLD were attributed to BPH in 2017 alone, almost three times more than those attributed to the next highest urological disease, prostate cancer (843 227 YLD). When stratified by SDI quintile, a much lower impact of BPH was found in the bottom three quintiles, despite this subset representing 66.9% of the 2017 world population.  Conclusions:   Lower urinary tract symptoms attributed to benign prostatic hyperplasia exert a rapidly rising human burden far exceeding other urological diseases. As the population ages and men in a lower SDI enjoy increased life expectancy and decreased competing mortalities, a continually accelerating wave of LUTS/BPH can be forecast.

Differential motion between targets can compromise the treatment accuracy, yet there are currently no methods able to adapt to independent target motion. This study developed a multileaf collimator (MLC) tracking algorithm for differential motion adaptation and evaluated it in simulated treatments of locally advanced prostate cancer.  Methods:   A multi-target MLC tracking algorithm was developed that consisted of three steps: (a) dividing the MLC aperture into two possibly overlapping sections assigned to the prostate and lymph nodes, (b) calculating the ideally shaped MLC aperture as a union of the individually translated sections, and (c) fitting the MLC positions to the ideal aperture shape within the physical constraints of the MLC leaves. The multi-target tracking method was evaluated and compared with two existing motion management methods: single-target tracking and no tracking. Treatment simulations of six locally advanced prostate cancer patients with three prostate motion traces were performed for all three motion adaptation methods. The geometric error for each motion adaptation method was calculated using the area of overexposure and underexposure of each field. The dosimetric error was estimated by calculating the dose delivered to the prostate, lymph nodes, bladder, rectum, and small bowel using a motion-encoded dose reconstruction method.  Results:   Multi-target MLC tracking showed an average improvement in geometric error of 84% compared to single-target tracking, and 83% compared to no tracking. Multi-target tracking maintained dose coverage to the prostate clinical target volume (CTV) D98% and planning target volume (PTV) D95% to within 4.8% and 3.9% of the planned values, compared to 1.4% and 0.7% with single-target tracking, and 20.4% and 31.8% with no tracking. With multi-target tracking, the node CTV D95%, PTV D90%, and gross tumor volume (GTV) D95% were within 0.3%, 0.6%, and 0.3% of the planned values, compared to 9.1%, 11.2%, and 21.1% for single-target tracking, and 0.8%, 2.0%, and 3.2% with no tracking. The small bowel V57% was maintained within 0.2% to the plan using multi-target tracking, compared to 8% and 3.5% for single-target tracking and no tracking, respectively. Meanwhile, the bladder and rectum V50% increased by up to 13.6% and 5.2%, respectively, using multi-target tracking, compared to 2.7% and 1.9% for single-target tracking, and 11.2% and 11.5% for no tracking.  Conclusions:   A multi-target tracking algorithm was developed and tracked the prostate and lymph nodes independently during simulated treatments. As the algorithm optimizes for target coverage, tracking both targets simultaneously may increase the dose delivered to the organs at risk.""","""['Emily A Hewson', 'Yuanyuan Ge', ""Ricky O'Brien"", 'Stephanie Roderick', 'Linda Bell', 'Per R Poulsen', 'Thomas Eade', 'Jeremy T Booth', 'Paul J Keall', 'Doan T Nguyen']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Optimising multi-target multileaf collimator tracking using real-time dose for locally advanced prostate cancer patients.', 'First experimental evaluation of multi-target multileaf collimator tracking during volumetric modulated arc therapy for locally advanced prostate cancer.', 'Experimental investigation of dynamic real-time rotation-including dose reconstruction during prostate tracking radiotherapy.', 'Is multileaf collimator tracking or gating a better intrafraction motion adaptation strategy?

AR in stromal cells seems not to act via classical AR transcription factors such as FOXA1 but rather depends on the JUN/AP1 complex. Stromal AR appears to have tumor-promoting and tumor-protective functions depending on tumor stage. Loss of AR signaling in fibroblasts has been detected already in premalignant lesions in the skin and prostate and has been associated with tumor induction in xenografts of skin cancer and aggressive disease features and poor patient prognosis in prostate cancer.

However, the degree to which PCPs engage in this role for low-risk prostate cancer is unknown.  Objective:   Characterize PCP perceptions regarding their role in low-risk prostate cancer treatment decision-making.  Design:   Cross-sectional, national survey.  Main measures:   For men with low-risk prostate cancer, PCP reports of (1) confidence in treatment decision-making (high vs. low); (2) intended participation in key aspects of active surveillance treatment decision-making (more vs. less).  Key results:   A total of 347 from 741 eligible PCPs responded (adjusted response rate 56%). Half of respondent PCPs (50.3%) reported high confidence about engaging in low-risk prostate cancer treatment decision-making. The odds of PCPs reporting high confidence were greater among those in solo practice (vs working with > 1 PCP) (OR 2.18; 95% CI 1.14-4.17) and with higher volume of prostate cancer patients (> 15 vs. 6-10 in past year) (OR 2.16; 95% CI 1.02-4.61). PCP report of their intended participation in key aspects of active surveillance treatment decision-making varied: discussing worry (62.4%), reviewing benefits (48.5%) and risks (41.8%), and reviewing all treatment options (34.2%).

These hematologic abnormalities are suspected to occur in the context of underlying immune dysregulation and endothelial dysfunction. Elevated D-dimer levels, COVID-19-associated coagulopathy (CAC), disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), and positive lupus anticoagulants are the most common findings to date. Current guidelines suggest that all patients with COVID-19 should receive pharmacologic thromboprophylaxis. CASE REPORT An 89-year-old man with a medical history of hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and advanced prostate cancer in remission presented with generalized weakness. At our center, a reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction test was positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, but the patient did not have symptoms of COVID-19. He was also found to have a prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time, secondary to both a high titer of factor VIII inhibitor and a lupus anticoagulant. He eventually developed respiratory compromise, during which his disease manifested as a bleeding rather than a prothrombotic state. CONCLUSIONS This report highlights the importance of a comprehensive evaluation of prolonged partial thromboplastin time, rather than making an assumption based on a positive lupus anticoagulant result.

One such SNP is rs10993994. It is located in the β-microseminoprotein (MSMB) promoter region, mediates MSMB prostate secretion levels, and is linked to mRNA expression changes in both MSMB and the adjacent gene NCOA4. In addition, our previous work showed a second SNP, rs7098889, is in positive linkage disequilibrium with rs10993994 and associated with MSMB expression independent of rs10993994. Here, we generate a series of clones with single alleles removed by double guide RNA (gRNA) mediated CRISPR/Cas9 deletions, through which we demonstrate that each of these SNPs independently and greatly alters MSMB expression in an allele-specific manner. We further show that these SNPs have no substantial effect on the expression of NCOA4. These data demonstrate that a single SNP can have a large effect on gene expression and illustrate the importance of functional validation studies to deconvolute observed correlations. The method we have developed is generally applicable to test any SNP for which a relevant heterozygous cell line is available. AUTHOR SUMMARY: In pursuing the underlying biological mechanism of prostate cancer pathogenesis, scientists utilized the existence of common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the human genome as genetic markers to perform large scale genome wide association studies (GWAS) and have so far identified more than a hundred prostate cancer risk variants. Such variants provide an unbiased and systematic new venue to study the disease mechanism, and the next big challenge is to translate these genetic associations to the causal role of altered gene function in oncogenesis. The majority of these variants are waiting to be studied and lots of them may act in oncogenesis through gene expression regulation. To prove the concept, we took rs10993994 and its linked rs7098889 as an example and engineered single cell clones by allelic-specific CRISPR/Cas9 deletion to separate the effect of each allele. We observed that a single nucleotide difference would lead to surprisingly high level of MSMB gene expression change in a gene specific and cell-type specific manner. Our study strongly supports the notion that differential level of gene expression caused by risk variants and their associated genetic locus play a major role in oncogenesis and also highlights the importance of studying the function of MSMB encoded β-MSP in prostate cancer pathogenesis.""","""['Xing Wang', 'James E Hayes', 'Xing Xu', 'Xiaoni Gao', 'Dipti Mehta', 'Hans G Lilja', 'Robert J Klein']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Gene""","""['Investigation of the relationship between prostate cancer and MSMB and NCOA4 genetic variants and protein expression.', 'Prostate cancer risk SNP rs10993994 is a trans-eQTL for SNHG11 mediated through MSMB.', 'Fine mapping and functional analysis of a common variant in MSMB on chromosome 10q11.2 associated with prostate cancer susceptibility.', 'A meta-analysis of influence of MSMB promoter rs10993994 polymorphisms on prostate cancer risk.', 'MSMB variation and prostate cancer risk: clues towards a possible fungal etiology.', 'Systematic fine-mapping and functional studies of prostate cancer risk variants.', 'SNPMap-An integrated visual SNP interpretation tool.', 'Identification of Flowering Regulatory Networks and Hub Genes Expressed in the Leaves of Elymus sibiricus L.

We queried the National Cancer Data Base between 2004 and 2015 for patients that were cT1-3 cN+ cM0 CaP treated with RP. Patients with 0 nodes, cT4, or cM1 disease were excluded. We compared groups based on pathologic nodal status: Discordant (cN+ -> pN) & Concordant (cN+ -> pN+). Kaplan Meier estimations were used to compare OS. Logistic regression was used to determine possible predictors of nodal status. We find that of 6470 cN+ patients, 1,367 (21.1%) underwent RP, 866 (13.4%) had confirmed nodal status. Discordant status was found in 159 (18.4%) and concordant staging in 707 (81.6%). Differences exist in PSA at diagnosis (7.3 vs. 11.2), biopsy group, # of nodes examined (7 vs. 10), race, and Charlson index. Discordant staging had longer OS compared to Concordant staging (P = 0.007) and similar OS to a 3:1 matched cohort of high risk localized CaP patients used as reference (P = 0.46). Lower Gleason Score (GG1-3) was associated with an increased likelihood of discordant staging. Clinical nodal staging is associated with a substantial false positive rate.

The aim of the current study was to quantify the cost-effectiveness of using different risk thresholds for predicted LNI in CaP patients to inform decision making on omitting ePLND.  Methods:   Five different thresholds (2%, 5%, 10%, 20%, and 100%) used in practice for performing ePLND were compared using a decision analytic cohort model with the 100% threshold (i.e., no ePLND) as reference. Compared outcomes consisted of quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and costs. Baseline characteristics for the hypothetical cohort were based on an actual Dutch patient cohort containing 925 patients who underwent ePLND with risks of LNI predicted by the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center web-calculator. The best strategy was selected based on the incremental cost effectiveness ratio when applying a willingness to pay (WTP) threshold of €20,000 per QALY gained. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis was performed with Monte Carlo simulation to assess the robustness of the results.  Results:   Costs and health outcomes were lowest (€4,858 and 6.04 QALYs) for the 100% threshold, and highest (€10,939 and 6.21 QALYs) for the 2% threshold, respectively. The incremental cost effectiveness ratio for the 2%, 5%, 10%, and 20% threshold compared with the first threshold above (i.e., 5%, 10%, 20%, and 100%) were €189,222/QALY, €130,689/QALY, €51,920/QALY, and €23,187/QALY respectively. Applying a WTP threshold of €20.000 the probabilities for the 2%, 5%, 10%, 20%, and 100% threshold strategies being cost-effective were 0.0%, 0.3%, 4.9%, 30.3%, and 64.5% respectively.  Conclusion:   Applying a WTP threshold of €20.000, completely omitting ePLND in CaP patients is cost-effective compared to other risk-based strategies.

While recent trends in place of death suggest an increased frequency of dying at home, data is largely unknown for older adults with cancer.  Methods:   Deidentified death certificate data were obtained via the National Center for Health Statistics. All lung, colon, prostate, breast, and pancreas cancer deaths for older adults (defined as >65 years of age) from 2003 to 2017 were included. Multinomial logistic regression was used to test for differences in place of death associated with sociodemographic variables.  Results:   From 2003 through 2017, a total of 3,182,707 older adults died from lung, colon, breast, prostate and pancreas cancer. During this time, hospital and nursing home deaths decreased, and the rate of home and hospice facility deaths increased (all p < 0.001). In multivariable regression, all assessed variables were found to be associated with place of death. Overall, older age was associated with increased risk of nursing facility death versus home death. Black patients were more likely to experience hospital death (OR 1.7) and Hispanic ethnicity had lower odds of death in a nursing facility (OR 0.55). Since 2003, deaths in hospice facilities rapidly increased by 15%.

Emerging evidence has supported the fact that m6A is comprehensively involved in various diseases especially cancers. As a crucial reader, YTHDF2 usually mediates the degradation of m6A-modified mRNAs in m6A-dependent way. However, the function and mechanisms of m6A especially YTHDF2 in prostate cancer (PCa) still remain elusive.  Methods:   To investigate the functions and mechanisms of YTHDF2 in PCa, in vitro, in vivo biofunctional assays and epigenetics experiments were performed. Endogenous expression silencing of YTHDF2 and METTL3 was established with lentivirus-based shRNA technique. Colony formation, flow cytometry and trans-well assays were performed for cell function identifications. Subcutaneous xenografts and metastatic mice models were combined with in vivo imaging system to investigate the phenotypes when knocking down YTHDF2 and METTL3. m6A RNA immunoprecipitation (MeRIP) sequencing, mRNA sequencing, RIP-RT-qPCR and bioinformatics analysis were mainly used to screen and validate the direct common targets of YTHDF2 and METTL3. In addition, TCGA database was also used to analyze the expression pattern of YTHDF2, METTL3 and the common target LHPP in PCa, and their correlation with clinical prognosis.  Results:   The upregulated YTHDF2 and METTL3 in PCa predicted a worse overall survival rate. Knocking down YTHDF2 or METTL3 markedly inhibited the proliferation and migration of PCa in vivo and in vitro. LHPP and NKX3-1 were identified as the direct targets of both YTHDF2 and METTL3. YTHDF2 directly bound to the m6A modification sites of LHPP and NKX3-1 to mediate the mRNA degradation. Knock-down of YTHDF2 or METTL3 significantly induced the expression of LHPP and NKX3-1 at both mRNA and protein level with inhibited phosphorylated AKT. Overexpression of LHPP and NKX3-1 presented the consistent phenotypes and AKT phosphorylation inhibition with knock-down of YTHDF2 or METTL3. Phosphorylated AKT was consequently confirmed as the downstream of METTL3/YTHDF2/LHPP/NKX3-1 to induce tumor proliferation and migration.  Conclusion:   We propose a novel regulatory mechanism in which YTHDF2 mediates the mRNA degradation of the tumor suppressors LHPP and NKX3-1 in m6A-dependent way to regulate AKT phosphorylation-induced tumor progression in prostate cancer.

The survey contained validated questionnaires on various sleep-related parameters, as well as questions about sleep management strategies.  Results:   We recruited 82 PCa patients (67.9 ± 6.3 years old).

Insomnia severity and past use of androgen deprivation therapy were significant predictors for the number of sleep treatments used. Participants with a high ISI were more likely to have used medication, CBT, and herbal remedies or supplements for treating sleep issues than those with low ISI. Furthermore, in patients who had not used these treatments options, those with a high ISI were more willing to try CBT and hypnosis compared to those with a low ISI. Reasons for not willing to try various sleep treatments were documented.  Conclusion:   Most PCa patients are willing to adjust their behavior or lifestyle to improve their sleep habits/behaviours.

The tool is validated using volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) plans for treatment of prostate cancer by estimating the achievable organ at risk (OAR) sparing, based on the knowledge learned from prior plans.  Methods:   Prostate TP quality was investigated by evaluating the achieved OAR sparing in the rectum and bladder, based on their proximity to target surface. The knowledge base used in this work comprises 450 plans, consisting of 181 homogenous prostate plans and 269 simultaneous integrated boost (SIB) prostate plans. A knowledge-based algorithm was used to relate the absorbed doses of the OARs (rectum and bladder) and their proximity to the planning target volume (PTV). A metric (Mq,r value) was calculated to characterize the OAR sparing based on the weighted differences of the mean doses at binned distances to the PTV surface. The 90% probability ellipse of the normally distributed OARs Mq,r values was considered to define a threshold above which the treatment plan was re-optimized.  Results:   Following re-optimization, 8/11 of the homogenous plans and 6/13 of the SIB plans outside the 90% probability ellipse could be re-optimized to gain better OAR sparing while achieving the same or better target coverage. However, 3/4 of the homogenous TPs and 1/9 of the SIB TPs between 80% and 90% were improved. Mq,r values of bladder and rectum after re-optimizing the plans in both groups of homogenous and SIB showed lower values compared to the corresponding values before re-optimization, which implies that better OARs sparing was achieved.  Conclusions:   This work demonstrates an effective anatomy-specific QC tool for identifying suboptimal plans and determining the achievable OAR sparing for each individual patient anatomy.""","""['Buthayna Alnaalwa', 'Obioma Nwankwo', 'Yasser Abo-Madyan', 'Frank A Giordano', 'Frederik Wenz', 'Gerhard Glatting']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Quantitative analysis of the factors which affect the interpatient organ-at-risk dose sparing variation in IMRT plans.', 'Target miss using PTV-based IMRT compared to robust optimization via coverage probability concept in prostate cancer.', 'Clinical implementation of a knowledge based planning tool for prostate VMAT.', 'Robust optimization in lung treatment plans accounting for geometric uncertainty.', 'Knowledge-Based Planning for Intact Cervical Cancer.', 'Development and clinical validation of Knowledge-based planning for Volumetric Modulated Arc Therapy of cervical cancer including pelvic and para aortic fields.', 'Quantitative Comparison of Knowledge-Based and Manual Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy Planning for Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma.']"""

Results:   Among the 326,450 older men with median age of 69 years included in this study, 73% were categorized as free of comorbidity according to the Charlson Comorbidity Index; however, 84% had received at least one prescription during the year preceding the follow-up.

Thiazide diuretics, however, were only weakly associated with a mortality risk (HR = 1.5; 95% CI 1.4 to 1.5). Surprisingly, only weak associations with mortality were seen for major cardiovascular drug classes.

RC development is poorly understood because bladder biopsies are difficult to obtain. The goal of this study is to gain understanding of molecular changes that drive radiation-induced cystitis in cancer survivors using urine samples from prostate cancer survivors with history of radiation therapy. 94 urine samples were collected from prostate cancer survivors with (n = 85) and without (n = 9) history of radiation therapy. 15 patients with radiation history were officially diagnosed with radiation cystitis. Levels of 47 different proteins were measured using Multiplex Luminex. Comparisons were made between non-irradiated and irradiated samples, and within irradiated samples based on radiation cystitis diagnosis, symptom scores or hematuria. Statistical analysis was performed using Welch's t-test. In prostate cancer survivors with history of radiation therapy, elevated levels of PAI 1, TIMP1, TIMP2, HGF and VEGF-A were detected in patients that received a radiation cystitis diagnosis. These proteins were also increased in patients suffering from hematuria or high symptom scores. No inflammatory proteins were detected in the urine, except in patients with gross hematuria and end stage radiation cystitis. Active fibrosis and vascular distress is detectable in the urine through elevated levels of associated proteins. Inflammation is only detected in urine of patients with end-stage radiation cystitis disease. These results suggest that fibrosis and vascular damage drive the development of radiation cystitis and could lead to the development of more targeted treatments.""","""['Bernadette M M Zwaans', 'Heinz E Nicolai', 'Michael B Chancellor', 'Laura E Lamb']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Altered Angiogenic Growth Factors in Urine of Prostate Cancer Survivors With Radiation History and Radiation Cystitis.', 'Radiation or chemotherapy cystitis with ""pseudocarcinomatous"" features.', 'Cancer survivorship issues with radiation and hemorrhagic cystitis in gynecological malignancies.', 'Innovative use of intravesical tacrolimus for hemorrhagic radiation cystitis.', 'Understanding Molecular Mechanisms and Identifying Key Processes in Chronic Radiation Cystitis.', 'Lack of expression of miR-29a/b1 impairs bladder function in male mice.', 'Revolutionizing Radiotoxicity Management with Mesenchymal Stem Cells and Their Derivatives: A Focus on Radiation-Induced Cystitis.', 'Correlation Between Serum and Urine Biomarkers and the Intensity of Acute Radiation Cystitis in Patients Treated With Radiation Therapy for Localized Prostate Cancer: Protocol for the Radiotoxicity Bladder Biomarkers (RABBIO) Study.', 'Investigation of the physiological response of radiation-induced cystitis patients using hyperbaric oxygen.', 'Two New Potential Therapeutic Approaches in Radiation Cystitis Derived from Mesenchymal Stem Cells: Extracellular Vesicles and Conditioned Medium.']"""

Methods:   Data on all 161 consecutive patients undergoing prostate biopsy at our institution between November 2017 and July 2019 were retrospectively collected. The patients were referred to biopsy due to elevated prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and/or abnormal digital rectal examination (DRE) and/or at least one Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) lesion score of ≥3 on multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI). We included patients with PSA levels ≤20 ng/ml and those with 8-12 core biopsies. Histology results of SBs performed by in-bore MRGpB were compared to TRUS SBs. Chi-squared, Fischer's exact, and multivariate Pearson regression tests were used for statistical analysis (SPSS, IBM Corporation).  Results:   In total, 128 patients were eligible for analysis. Their median age was 68 years (interquartile range [IQR] 61.5-72), mean prostate size 55±29 cc, and mean PSA and PSA density levels 7.6±3.5 ng/ml and 0.18±0.13 ng/ml/cc, respectively. Thirty-five patients (27.3%) had suspicious DRE findings. Both biopsy groups were similar for these parameters. Thirty-eight (62.3%) MRGpB patients had a previous biopsy vs. five (7.1%) TRUS-SB patients (p<0.0001). The number of patients diagnosed with clinically significant and non-significant disease was similar for both groups. High-risk disease was more prevalent in the TRUS-SB group (22.4% vs. 4.9%, p<0.01).

We sought to determine differences in erectile function and urinary continence after focal and whole gland ablation for prostate cancer.  Materials and methods:   From 2009 to 2018, 346 patients underwent high intensity focused ultrasound or cryotherapy for prostate cancer. Urinary continence was defined as use of no pads and sexual potency as enough erection for sexual penetration. Logistic regressions to treatment groups and covariates age, prostate specific antigen, International Society of Urological Pathology grading, prostate volume and energy modality were performed to access the effect of focal therapy in sexual potency and urinary continence after 3 and 12 months. IIEF-5 (International Index of Erectile Function) and I-PSS (International Prostate Symptom Score) questionnaires were evaluated. Propensity score matching was performed to adjust for potential baseline differences between groups.  Results:   After exclusion, 195 post-focal therapy and 105 post-whole gland therapy patients were included in analysis. No significant difference was seen in baseline I-PSS and IIEF-5 scores. In multivariate models focal therapy was the most important factor related to sexual potency at 3 (OR 7.7) and 12 months (OR 3.9). Median IIEF-5 score at 3 months was 12 and 5 (p <0.001), and at 12 months was 13 and 9 (p=0.04) in focal therapy and whole gland therapy groups, respectively. Focal therapy was the only factor related to continence (OR 0.7, p <0.001). Results remained significant after propensity score matching.

It was hypothesized that men using the Personal Patient Profile-Prostate (P3P) would be more likely to pursue guideline-concordant treatment.  Methods:   Men from a trial assessing the P3P decision support intervention were identified. The primary exposure was allocation to P3P (vs usual care), and the outcome was appropriate treatment per guidelines (eg, low risk = active surveillance). It was assessed whether providers recommended against any treatment options (ie, restricted). A multivariable model was fit for men with low-risk cancer that estimated the odds of the outcome of interest.  Results:   This study identified 295 men in the cohort: 113 (38%) had low-risk disease, 119 (40%) had favorable intermediate-risk disease, and 63 (21%) had unfavorable intermediate-risk disease. Among low-risk patients, more men pursued active surveillance after using P3P whether they were given unrestricted (62% vs 54% with usual care; P = .54) or restricted options (71% vs 59% with usual care; P = .34). After adjustments, only Black race (odds ratio [OR], 0.31; 95% CI, 0.11-0.89) and restricted options (OR, 0.23; 95% CI, 0.08-0.65) had an inverse association with the receipt of surveillance for patients with low-risk prostate cancer. An impact associated with P3P versus usual care (OR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.36-2.20) was not observed.  Conclusions:   Among men in a trial assessing a decision support tool, Black race and restricted treatment options were associated with less use of active surveillance for low-risk prostate cancer.

Steep dose-averaged LET (LETd ) gradients and elevated LETd occur at the end of proton range and might be particularly sensitive to uncertainties in range prediction. Therefore, this study quantified LETd distributions and the impact of range uncertainty in robust dose-optimized proton treatment plans and assessed the biological effect in normal tissues and tumors of patients.  Methods:   For each of six cancer patients (two brain, head-and-neck, and prostate), two nominal treatment plans were robustly dose optimized using single- and multi-field optimization, respectively. For each plan, two additional scenarios with ±3.5% range deviation relative to the nominal plan were derived by global rescaling of stopping-power ratios. Dose and LETd distributions were calculated for each scenario using the beam parameters of the corresponding nominal plan. The variability in relative biological effectiveness (RBE) and probability of late radiation-induced brain toxicity (PIC ) was assessed.  Results:   The optimization technique (single- vs multi-field) had a negligible impact on the LETd distributions in the clinical target volume (CTV) and in most organs at risk (OARs). LETd distributions in the CTV were rather homogeneous with arithmetic mean of LETd below 3.2 keV/µm and robust against range deviations. The RBE variability within the CTV induced by range uncertainty was small (≤0.05, 95% confidence interval). In OARs, LETd hotspots (>7 keV/µm) occurred and LETd distributions were inhomogeneous and sensitive to range deviations. LETd hotspots and the impact of range deviations were most prominent in OARs of brain tumor patients which translated in RBE values exceeding 1.1 in all brain OARs. The near-maximum predicted PIC in healthy brain tissue of brain tumor patients was smaller than 5% and occurred adjacent to the CTV. Range deviations induced absolute differences in PIC up to 1.2%.  Conclusions:   Robust dose optimization generates LETd distributions in the target volume robust against range deviations. The current findings support using a constant RBE within the CTV. The impact of range deviations on the considered probability of late radiation-induced toxicity in brain tissue was limited for robust dose-optimized treatment plans. Incorporation of LETd in robust optimization frameworks may further reduce uncertainty related to the RBE-weighted dose estimation in normal tissues.""","""['Christian Hahn', 'Jan Eulitz', 'Nils Peters', 'Patrick Wohlfahrt', 'Wolfgang Enghardt', 'Christian Richter', 'Armin Lühr']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Comparing biological effectiveness guided plan optimization strategies for cranial proton therapy: potential and challenges.', 'Quantitative analysis of dose-averaged linear energy transfer (LETd ) robustness in pencil beam scanning proton lung plans.', 'Spatial correlation of linear energy transfer and relative biological effectiveness with suspected treatment-related toxicities following proton therapy for intracranial tumors.', 'Relative Biological Effectiveness Uncertainties and Implications for Beam Arrangements and Dose Constraints in Proton Therapy.', 'Relative biological effectiveness (RBE) values for proton beam therapy.

This study examines the levels of self-reported adverse effects (AEs) after robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RALP) in Norwegian men with high or low levels of neuroticism. Neuroticism is also compared to relevant factors concerning their associations with various AEs.  Methods:   Among 982 men who had RALP at Oslo University Hospital, Radiumhospitalet between 2005 and 2010, 79% responded to a mailed questionnaire in 2011. They rated AEs by completing the EPIC-26 questionnaire, and neuroticism on the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire (EPQ). Men with < 1 year's follow-up, treatment failure, and incomplete EPQ responses were omitted, leaving 524 men for analysis. The EPQ responses were dichotomized into low and high level of neuroticism. Stepwise multivariate linear regression analyses were used for examination of associations with the EPIC-26 domain scores.  Results:   High neuroticism was reported by 20% (95% CI 17-23%) of the patients. On the EPIC-26 dimensions men with high neuroticism had significantly lower mean scores than men with low neuroticism. Most of these between-group differences were clinically significant. In multivariate regression analyses, high neuroticism contributed significantly to all EPIC-26 domains.  Conclusion:   Increased levels of AEs after RALP are significantly associated with high neuroticism. A short screening test should be added to the current EPIC-26 instrument to identify patients with high neuroticism. In these patients, pre-operative counseling should take into account their risk of increased AE experiences.""","""['Alv A Dahl', 'Sophie D Fosså', 'Bjørn Brennhovd', 'Karol Axcrona']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Int Urol Nephrol""","""['A cross-sectional study of current work ability after radical prostatectomy.', 'High Neuroticism Is Related to More Overall Functional Problems and Lower Function Scores in Men Who Had Surgery for Non-Relapsing Prostate Cancer.', 'Comparison of outcomes between pure laparoscopic vs robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy: a study of comparative effectiveness based upon validated quality of life outcomes.', 'Robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy versus open radical retropubic prostatectomy: early outcomes from a randomised controlled phase 3 study.', 'Laparoscopic and robotic-assisted versus open radical prostatectomy for the treatment of localised prostate cancer.', 'Experience Measures after Radical Prostatectomy: A Register-Based Study Evaluating the Association between Patient-Reported Symptoms and Quality of Information.', 'Psychosocial and Functional Predictors of Mental Disorder among Prostate Cancer Survivors: Informing Survivorship Care Programs with Evidence-Based Knowledge.', 'Personality Traits and Urinary Symptoms Are Associated with Mental Health Distress in Patients with a Diagnosis of Prostate Cancer.']"""

Herein, we evaluated the impact of ICA II on human prostate cancer cell proliferation, motility, and autophagy, and we further evaluated the molecular mechanisms underlying these effects.  Methods:   We treated DU145 human prostate cancer cells with a range of ICA II doses and then assessed their proliferation via CCK-8 assay, while flow cytometry was used to monitor apoptosis and cell cycle progression. We further utilized wound healing and transwell assays to probe the impact of ICA II on migration and invasion, and assessed autophagy via laser confocal fluorescence microscopy. Western blotting was further utilized to measure LC3-II/I, Beclin-1, P70S6K, PI3K, AKT, mTOR, phospho-AKT, phospho-mTOR, and phospho-P70S6K levels, with qRT-PCR being used to evaluate the expression of specific genes at the mRNA level.  Results:   We found that ICA II was capable of mediating the dose- and time-dependent suppression of DU145 cell proliferation, causing these cells to enter a state of cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. We further determined that ICA II treatment was associated with significant impairment of prostate cancer cell migration and invasion, whereas autophagy was enhanced in treated cells relative to untreated controls.  Conclusion:   Our results indicate that ICA II treatment is capable of suppressing human prostate tumor cell proliferation and migration while enhancing autophagy via modulating the PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling pathway. As such, ICA II may be an ideal candidate drug for the treatment of prostate cancer.""","""['Shuang Li#', 'Yunlu Zhan#', 'Yingwei Xie#', 'Yonghui Wang', 'Yuexin Liu']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Drug Des Devel Ther""","""['ISL Induces Apoptosis and Autophagy in Hepatocellular Carcinoma via Downregulation of PI3K/AKT/mTOR Pathway in vivo and in vitro.', 'mTOR is a fine tuning molecule in CDK inhibitors-induced distinct cell death mechanisms via PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling axis in prostate cancer cells.', 'Pogostone induces autophagy and apoptosis involving PI3K/Akt/mTOR axis in human colorectal carcinoma HCT116 cells.', 'Novel Insights into Autophagy and Prostate Cancer: A Comprehensive Review.', 'Therapeutic Properties of Flavonoids in Treatment of Cancer through Autophagic Modulation: A Systematic Review.', 'Targeting PI3K/Akt signaling in prostate cancer therapy.', 'Pharmacological mechanism and therapeutic efficacy of Icariside II in the treatment of acute ischemic stroke: a systematic review and network pharmacological analysis.', 'Astragalus-Scorpion Drug Pair Inhibits the Development of Prostate Cancer by Regulating GDPD4-2/PI3K/AKT/mTOR Pathway and Autophagy.', 'Icariside II enhances cisplatin-induced apoptosis by promoting endoplasmic reticulum stress signalling in non-small cell lung cancer cells.', 'Icariside II: Anticancer Potential and Molecular Targets in Solid Cancers.']"""

By analyzing somatic mutations in 39 genes using deeper next-generation sequencing with an average depth of 2,522 reads for tumor DNA and genome-wide DNA copy-number alterations (CNA) in prostate cancer in a total of 171 AA/black men and comparing with those in 860 European American (EA)/white men, we here present several novel findings. First, >35% of AA men harbor damaging mutations in APC, ATM, BRCA2, KDM6A, KMT2C, KMT2D, MED12, ZFHX3, and ZMYM3, each with >1% of mutated copies. Second, among genes with >10% of mutated copies in tumor cells, ZMYM3 is the most frequently mutated gene in AA prostate cancer. In a patient's tumor with >96% frameshift mutations of ZMYM3, we find allelic imbalances in 10 chromosomes, including losses of five and gains of another four chromosomes, suggesting its role in maintaining genomic integrity. Third, when compared to prostate cancer in EA/white men, a higher frequency of CNAs of MYC, THADA, NEIL3, LRP1B, BUB1B, MAP3K7, BNIP3L and RB1, and a lower frequency of deletions of RYBP, TP53, and TMPRSS2-ERG are observed in AA/black men. Finally, for the above genes with higher frequency of CNAs in AA than in EA, deletion of MAP3K7, BNIP3L, NEIL3 or RB1, or gain of MYC significantly associates with both higher Gleason grade and advanced pathologic stage in AA/black men. Deletion of THADA associates with advanced pathologic stage only. IMPLICATIONS: A higher frequency of damaging mutation in ZMYM3 causing genomic instability along with higher frequency of altered genomic regions including deletions of MAP3K7, BNIP3L, RB1, and NEIL3, and gain of MYC appear to be distinct somatically acquired genetic alterations that may contribute to more aggressive prostate cancer in AA/black men.""","""['Wennuan Liu', 'S Lilly Zheng', 'Rong Na', 'Lin Wei', 'Jishan Sun', 'Johnie Gallagher', 'Jun Wei', 'W Kyle Resurreccion', 'Sarah Ernst', 'Karen S Sfanos', 'William B Isaacs', 'Jianfeng Xu']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Mol Cancer Res""","""['Genomic, epigenomic, and transcriptomic signatures of prostate cancer between African American and European American patients.', 'Genomic Profiling of Prostate Cancers from Men with African and European Ancestry.', 'Integrative comparison of the genomic and transcriptomic landscape between prostate cancer patients of predominantly African or European genetic ancestry.', 'Compound Genomic Alterations of TP53, PTEN, and RB1 Tumor Suppressors in Localized and Metastatic Prostate Cancer.', 'Involvement of the multiple tumor suppressor genes and 12-lipoxygenase in human prostate cancer.

Here, we show that transcriptional repression of mitochondrial deacetylase sirtuin 3 (SIRT3) by androgen receptor (AR) and its coregulator steroid receptor coactivator-2 (SRC-2) enhances mitochondrial aconitase (ACO2) activity to favor aggressive prostate cancer. ACO2 promoted mitochondrial citrate synthesis to facilitate de novo lipogenesis, and genetic ablation of ACO2 reduced total lipid content and severely repressed in vivo prostate cancer progression. A single acetylation mark lysine258 on ACO2 functioned as a regulatory motif, and the acetylation-deficient Lys258Arg mutant was enzymatically inactive and failed to rescue growth of ACO2-deficient cells. Acetylation of ACO2 was reversibly regulated by SIRT3, which was predominantly repressed in many tumors including prostate cancer. Mechanistically, SRC-2-bound AR formed a repressive complex by recruiting histone deacetylase 2 to the SIRT3 promoter, and depletion of SRC-2 enhanced SIRT3 expression and simultaneously reduced acetylated ACO2. In human prostate tumors, ACO2 activity was significantly elevated, and increased expression of SRC-2 with concomitant reduction of SIRT3 was found to be a genetic hallmark enriched in prostate cancer metastatic lesions. In a mouse model of spontaneous bone metastasis, suppression of SRC-2 reactivated SIRT3 expression and was sufficient to abolish prostate cancer colonization in the bone microenvironment, implying this nuclear-mitochondrial regulatory axis is a determining factor for metastatic competence. SIGNIFICANCE: This study highlights the importance of mitochondrial aconitase activity in the development of advanced metastatic prostate cancer and suggests that blocking SRC-2 to enhance SIRT3 expression may be therapeutically valuable.

Case presentation:   Here we present a case study of a male in 70 s with high-grade clinically-localised acinar adenocarcinoma treated with definitive hormone therapy and radiotherapy. The patient progressed rapidly with rising PSA and succumbed without metastasis 52 months after diagnosis. We identified the expression of canonical histological markers of neuroendocrine PC (NEPC) including synaptophysin, neuron-specific enolase and thyroid transcription factor 1, as well as intact AR expression, in the recurrent disease only. The resistant disease was also marked by an extremely low immune infiltrate, extensive genomic chromosomal aberrations, and overactivity in molecular hallmarks of NEPC disease including Aurora kinase and E2F, as well as novel alterations in the cMYB pathway. We also observed that responses to both primary treatments (high dose-rate brachytherapy and androgen deprivation therapies) were consistent with known optimal responses-ruling out treatment inefficacy as a factor in relapse.

Therefore, the objective of this study was to quantify the sinigrin in the R. sativus roots using developed and validated RP-HPLC method and further evaluated its' anticancer activity. To achieve the objective, the roots of R. sativus were lyophilized to obtain a stable powder, which were extracted and passed through an ion-exchange column to obtain sinigrin-rich fraction. The RP-HPLC method using C18 analytical column was used for chromatographic separation and quantification of sinigrin in the prepared fraction, which was attained using the mobile phase consisting of 20 mM tetrabutylammonium: acetonitrile (80:20%, v/v at pH 7.0) at a flow rate of 0.5 mL/min. The chromatographic peak for sinigrin was showed at 3.592 min for pure sinigrin, where a good linearity was achieved within the concentration range of 50 to 800 µg/mL (R2 > 0.99), with an excellent accuracy (-1.37% and -1.29%) and precision (1.43% and 0.94%), for intra and inter-day, respectively. Finally, the MTT assay was performed for the sinigrin-rich fraction using three different human cancer cell lines, viz. prostate cancer (DU-145), colon adenocarcinoma (HCT-15), and melanoma (A-375). The cell-based assays were extended to conduct apoptotic and caspase-3 activities, to determine the mechanism of action of sinigrin in the treatment of cancer. MTT assay showed IC50 values of 15.88, 21.42, and 24.58 µg/mL for DU-145, HCT-15, and A-375 cell lines, respectively. Increased cellular apoptosis and caspase-3 expression were observed with sinigrin-rich fraction, indicating significant increase in overexpression of caspase-3 in DU-145 cells. In conclusion, a simple, sensitive, fast, and accurate RP-HPLC method was developed for the estimation of sinigrin in the prepared fraction.

Methods: A retrospective analysis of (99)Tc(m)-methylene diphosphonate ((99)Tc(m)-MDP) whole-body bone imaging data of 93 patients with confirmed PCa in The First Hospital of Shanxi Medical University from Jan 2018 to Jan 2019 was conducted. The bone metastasis was diagnosed by whole-body bone imaging. The factors related to PCa bone metastasis, including age, TPSA, RAT (F/T), Gleason score were analyzed by Chi-square test and logistic two-class regression. The optimal cut-off point of TPSA was defined by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. The region of interest (ROI) technique was used to repeatedly delineate the lesion (T) and the background area (NT) outside the bone and calculate the abnormal concentration value of bone imaging agent (T-NT)/NT, and the ROC curve was used to determine its diagnostic value. Results: The result of Chi-square analysis showed that Gleason score, TPSA and RAT (F/T) were associated with bone metastasis (P<0.05). Logistic regression analysis showed that TPSA and RAT (F/T) were associated with bone metastasis (P<0.01).

Methods:   Consecutive patients diagnosed prostate cancer (127 with combination of both targeted biopsy (TBx) plus systematic biopsies (SBx) and separate patient cohort of 330 conventional TRUS-Bx without mpMRI) with a PSA level of <20 ng/mL prior to RP were included. The primary end point was the grade group concordance between biopsy and RP pathology according to biopsy technique.  Results:   Clinically significant prostate cancer detection was 51.2% for TRUS-Bx, 49.5% for SBx, 67% for TBx and 75.7% for TBx + SBx. Upgrading and downgrading of at least one Gleason Grade Group (GGG) was recorded in 43.3%/ 6.7% patients of the TRUS-Bx and in 20.5%/ 22% of the TBX + SBx group, respectively (all P < .001). Concordance level was detected to be significantly higher for ISUP 1 in combined TBx + SBx method compared to conventional TRUS-Bx (61.3% vs 37.9%, P = .014). In ISUP 1 exclusively, significant upgrading was seen in TRUS-Bx (62.1%) when compared to TBx (41.4%) and TBx + SBx (38.7%).  Conclusions:   MRI-targeted biopsies detected more significant PCa than TRUS-Bx but, superiority in significant cancer detection appears as a result of inadvertant selective sampling of small higher grade areas.

Patients and methods:   We prospectively enrolled 407 consecutive prostate cancer (PC) patients undergoing RARP between May 2017 and January 2020. The first 250 patients underwent only TAR, while the following 157 patients TAR + TZ sling, by isolating and anchoring the retrotrigonal muscular layer to the pubic bone with 2 bilateral sutures. We defined UC as ≤ 1 pad/die, which was assessed after catheter removal at 1, 4 and 12wk using the International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire-Short Form (ICIQ-SF) score. Sling-related operative time and post-operative complications were analyzed.  Results:   In the TAR group, the UC rates at the 1, 4 and 12wk were 58%, 66% and 86%; in the TAR + TZ sling group 72%, 76% and 88%, respectively.

However, adiponectin is progressively emerging as having aberrant signalling in multiple disease states, including prostate cancer (PCa). Circulating adiponectin is lower in patients with PCa than in non-malignant disease, and inversely correlates with cancer severity. More severe hypoadiponectinemia is observed in advanced PCa than in organ-confined disease. Given the crossover between adiponectin signalling and several cancer hallmark pathways that influence PCa growth and progression, we hypothesised that targeting dysregulated adiponectin signalling may inhibit tumour growth and progression. We, therefore, aimed to test the efficacy of correcting the hypoadiponectinemia and dysregulated adiponectin signalling observed in PCa, a world-first PCa therapeutic approach, using peptide adiponectin receptor (ADIPOR) agonist ADP355 in mice bearing subcutaneous LNCaP xenografts. We demonstrate significant evidence for PCa growth inhibition by ADP355, which slowed tumour growth and delayed progression of serum PCa biomarker, prostate-specific antigen (PSA), compared to vehicle. ADP355 conferred a significant advantage by increasing time on treatment with a delayed ethical endpoint. mRNA sequencing and protein expression analyses of tumours revealed ADP355 PCa growth inhibition may be through altered cellular energetics, cellular stress and protein synthesis, which may culminate in apoptosis, as evidenced by the increased apoptotic marker in ADP355-treated tumours. Our findings highlight the efficacy of ADP355 in targeting classical adiponectin-associated signalling pathways in vivo and provide insights into the promising future for modulating adiponectin signalling through ADIPOR agonism as a novel anti-tumour treatment modality.""","""['Lisa K Philp', 'Anja Rockstroh', 'Melanie Lehman', 'Martin C Sadowski', 'Nenad Bartonicek', 'John D Wade', 'Laszlo Otvos', 'Colleen C Nelson']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Endocr Relat Cancer""","""['Activation of Adiponectin Receptor Regulates Proprotein Convertase Subtilisin/Kexin Type 9 Expression and Inhibits Lesions in ApoE-Deficient Mice.', 'Adiponectin-Based Peptide (ADP355) Inhibits Transforming Growth Factor-β1-Induced Fibrosis in Keloids.', 'Leptin antagonism inhibits prostate cancer xenograft growth and progression.', 'Role of Adiponectin in prostate cancer.', 'The evolving role of oestrogens and their receptors in the development and progression of prostate cancer.', 'Regulation of epithelial-mesenchymal transition by tumor microenvironmental signals and its implication in cancer therapeutics.', 'Interplay between Prostate Cancer and Adipose Microenvironment: A Complex and Flexible Scenario.', 'Thromboinflammatory Processes at the Nexus of Metabolic Dysfunction and Prostate Cancer: The Emerging Role of Periprostatic Adipose Tissue.', 'Role of the CTRP family in tumor development and progression.', 'Ceramide Metabolism Enzymes-Therapeutic Targets against Cancer.']"""

However, previous trials assessing platinum-based treatments in patients with CRPC have mostly included a biomarker-unselected population; therefore, efficacy in these patients is unknown.  Objective:   To characterize the antitumor activity of platinum-based therapies in men with CRPC with or without DNA repair gene alterations.  Design, setting, and participants:   In this case series, data from 508 patients with CRPC treated with platinum-based therapy were collected from 25 academic centers from 12 countries worldwide. Patients were grouped by status of DNA repair gene aberrations (ie, cohort 1, present; cohort 2, not detected; and cohort 3, not tested). Data were collected from January 1986 to December 2018. Data analysis was performed in 2019, with data closure in April 2019.  Exposure:   Treatment with platinum-based compounds either as monotherapy or combination therapy.  Main outcomes and measures:   The primary end points were as follows: (1) antitumor activity of platinum-based therapy, defined as a decrease in prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level of at least 50% and/or radiological soft tissue response in patients with measurable disease and (2) the association of response with the presence or absence of DNA repair gene aberrations.  Results:   A total of 508 men with a median (range) age of 61 (27-88) years were included in this analysis. DNA repair gene aberrations were present in 80 patients (14.7%; cohort 1), absent in 98 (19.3%; cohort 2), and not tested in 330 (65.0%; cohort 3). Of 408 patients who received platinum-based combination therapy, 338 patients (82.8%) received docetaxel, paclitaxel, or etoposide, and 70 (17.2%) received platinum-based combination treatment with another partner. A PSA level decrease of at least 50% was seen in 33 patients (47.1%) in cohort 1 and 26 (36.1%) in cohort 2 (P = .20). In evaluable patients, soft tissue responses were documented in 28 of 58 patients (48.3%) in cohort 1 and 21 of 67 (31.3%) in cohort 2 (P = .07).

Although synergistic hydrophobic-hydrophilic combination drugs have been used with some success, the main drawbacks of this approach are poor bioavailability, unfavorable pharmacokinetics, and low tissue distribution. To improve their synergistic effect and overcome limitations, we encapsulated EGCG and low-dose docetaxel within TPGS-conjugated hyaluronic acid and fucoidan-based nanoparticles. This approach might facilitate simultaneous target-specific markers at the edge and center of the tumor and then might increase intratumoral drug accumulation. Additionally, the successful release of bioactive combination drugs was regulated by the pH-sensitive nanoparticles and internalization into prostate cancer cells through CD44 and P-selectin ligand recognition, and the inhibition of cell growth via induced G2/M phase cell cycle arrest was observed in in vitro study. In in vivo studies, treatment with cancer-targeted combination drug-loaded nanoparticles significantly attenuated tumor growth and increased M30 protein expression without causing organ damage.

PSMD4 overexpression has been observed in colon carcinoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, and breast cancer. In this work, we elucidated the effect of hypoxia on PSMD4 gene expression in prostate cancer cells (PC3). Chemically mimicked hypoxia drastically upregulated PSMD4 gene expression at both mRNA and protein levels.

The aim of our study was to investigate the role of PTX3 as possible modulator of Complement activation in the development of this neoplasia. We performed a single center cohort study; from January 2017 through December 2018, serum and prostate tissue samples were obtained from 620 patients undergoing prostate biopsy. A group of patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) underwent a second biopsy within 12-36 months demonstrating the presence of a prostate cancer (Group A, n = 40) or confirming the diagnosis of BPH (Group B, N = 40). We measured tissue PTX3 protein expression together with complement activation by confocal microscopy in the first and second biopsy in group A and B patients. We confirmed that that PTX3 tissue expression in the first biopsy was increased in group A compared to group B patients. C1q deposits were extensively present in group A patients co-localizing and significantly correlating with PTX3 deposits; on the contrary, C1q/PTX3 deposits were negative in group B. Moreover, we found a significantly increased expression of C3a and C5a receptors within resident cells in group A patient. Interestingly, C1q/PTX3 deposits were not associated with activation of the terminal Complement complex C5b-9; moreover, we found a significant increase of Complement inhibitor CD59 in cancer tissue. Our data indicate that PTX3 might play a significant pathogenic role in the development of this neoplasia through recruitment of the early components of Complement cascade with hampered activation of terminal Complement pathway associated with the upregulation of CD59. This alteration might lead to the PTX3-mediated promotion of cellular proliferation, angiogenesis and insensitivity to apoptosis possible leading to cancer cell invasion and migration.""","""['Giovanni Stallone', 'Giuseppe Stefano Netti', 'Luigi Cormio', 'Giuseppe Castellano', 'Barbara Infante', 'Paola Pontrelli', 'Chiara Divella', 'Oscar Selvaggio', 'Federica Spadaccino', 'Elena Ranieri', 'Francesca Sanguedolce', 'Antonio Pennella', 'Loreto Gesualdo', 'Giuseppe Carrieri', 'Giuseppe Grandaliano']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Sci Rep""","""['Pentraxin 3: a novel biomarker for predicting progression from prostatic inflammation to prostate cancer.', 'Pentraxin-3-mediated complement activation in a swine model of renal ischemia/reperfusion injury.', 'PTX3 modulates the immunoflogosis in tumor microenvironment and is a prognostic factor for patients with clear cell renal cell carcinoma.', 'Interactions of the humoral pattern recognition molecule PTX3 with the complement system.', 'The long pentraxin PTX3 as a key component of humoral innate immunity and a candidate diagnostic for inflammatory diseases.', 'Role of long pentraxin PTX3 in cancer.', 'Prostate cancer autoantibodies - applications in diagnosis, prognosis, monitoring disease progression and immunotherapy.', 'The crossroad between autoimmune disorder, tissue remodeling and cancer of the thyroid: The long pentraxin 3 (PTX3).', 'A Novel Blood Proteomic Signature for Prostate Cancer.', 'Insights into the Relationship between Pentraxin-3 and Cancer.']"""

Mutations in the SRD5A2 gene have been linked to 5α-reductase deficiency and prostate cancer. Finasteride and dutasteride, as SRD5A2 inhibitors, are widely used antiandrogen drugs for benign prostate hyperplasia. The molecular mechanisms underlying enzyme catalysis and inhibition for SRD5A2 and other eukaryotic integral membrane steroid reductases remain elusive due to a lack of structural information. Here, we report a crystal structure of human SRD5A2 at 2.8 Å, revealing a unique 7-TM structural topology and an intermediate adduct of finasteride and NADPH as NADP-dihydrofinasteride in a largely enclosed binding cavity inside the transmembrane domain. Structural analysis together with computational and mutagenesis studies reveal the molecular mechanisms of the catalyzed reaction and of finasteride inhibition involving residues E57 and Y91. Molecular dynamics simulation results indicate high conformational dynamics of the cytosolic region that regulate NADPH/NADP+ exchange. Mapping disease-causing mutations of SRD5A2 to our structure suggests molecular mechanisms for their pathological effects.

The purpose of our study was to evaluate the inter-observer agreement of WB-MRI examination reports produced by readers of different expertise when using the MET-RADS-P guidelines.  Methods:   Fifty consecutive paired WB-MRI examinations, performed from December 2016 to February 2018 on 31 patients, were retrospectively examined to compare reports by a Senior Radiologist (9 years of experience in WB-MRI) and Resident Radiologist (after a 6-months training) using MET-RADS-P guidelines, for detection and for primary/dominant and secondary response assessment categories (RAC) scores assigned to metastatic disease in 14 body regions. Inter-observer agreement regarding RAC score was evaluated for each region by using weighted-Cohen's Kappa statistics (K).  Results:   The number of metastatic regions reported by the Senior Radiologist (249) and Resident Radiologist (251) was comparable. For the primary/dominant RAC pattern, the agreement between readers was excellent for the metastatic findings in cervical, dorsal, and lumbosacral spine, pelvis, limbs, lungs and other sites (K:0.81-1.0), substantial for thorax, retroperitoneal nodes, other nodes and liver (K:0.61-0.80), moderate for pelvic nodes (K:0.56), fair for primary soft tissue and not assessable for skull due to the absence of findings.

A low prostate-specific antigen and a symptomatic patient, including paraneoplastic symptoms, characterize small cell carcinoma of the prostate. Diagnosis is made on the basis of prostate biopsy, and fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography is often used for staging because up to 60% of patients present with de novo metastatic disease. Patients with metastatic disease are usually treated with platinum-based cytotoxic chemotherapy regimens similar to those used for small cell carcinoma of the lung. However, prognosis remains poor, with a median overall survival of 9 to 17 months despite therapy.  Case presentation:   This report describes a case of an 80-year-old Caucasian patient with lymph node and bone metastatic small cell carcinoma of the prostate following low-dose-rate brachytherapy for a low-risk prostate carcinoma and treated with chemotherapy and immunotherapy.

Methods:   We retrospectively reviewed 300 patients with PCa who received surgical treatment between November 2010 and June 2015 at our institution. They were divided into group A, three-port LRP; group B, conventional four-five-port LRP; group C, open RP (ORP); and group D, robotic-assisted RP (RARP). A learning curve was analyzed by dividing patients of group A into the early and late stages.  Results:   All groups were comparable with regard to the preoperative characteristics except for the relatively smaller prostate volume in group A. The three-port LRP operations were performed successfully with only 8 cases of conversion to the conventional LRP. None of any severe complications or conversion to ORP occurred. In group A, the mean operative time (OT) duration was 113.8 min, the mean estimated blood loss (EBL) was 94.2 ml, the mean drainage days was 4.0 days, the mean hospitalization was 5.1 days, and 27.8% of the prostate specimen margins (PSM) were positive. The differences of OT, EBL, drainage days, hospitalization, and transfusion in group A were statistically significant among the majority of the other groups (p < 0.05). After undergoing the early stages of a learning curve analysis in three-port LRP, the EBL was obviously decreased.  Conclusions:   Three-port LRP is a novel technique that exhibits superior intraoperative advantages to the conventional LRP. Due to its less OT, EBL, drainage days, hospitalization, and transfusion with a shorter learning curve, it should be recommended and popularized in the clinical practice.""","""['Ben Xu', 'Yi-Ji Peng', 'Guo-Zhong Ma', 'Qian Zhang']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""World J Surg Oncol""","""['Learning Curve of an Innovative ""3-Port"" Laparoscopic Radical Prostatectomy: A Single-Center Analysis from 2016 to 2019.', 'Comparison of functional and oncological outcomes of innovative ""three-port"" and traditional ""four-port"" laparoscopic radical prostatectomy in patients with prostate cancer.', 'Patterns-of-care and health economic analysis of robot-assisted radical prostatectomy in the Australian public health system.', 'Comparison of perioperative, functional, and oncologic outcomes between standard laparoscopic and robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy: a systemic review and meta-analysis.', 'Laparoscopic radical prostatectomy versus robotic.', 'Three-port approach vs conventional laparoscopic radical cystectomy with orthotopic neobladder: a single-center retrospective study.', 'Robotic-assisted versus laparoscopic radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer: the first separate systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials and non-randomised studies.', 'Three-port approach vs standard laparoscopic radical cystectomy with an ileal conduit: a single-centre retrospective study.']"""

In the course of the development and progression of this disease, abnormal expression of miR-203 is usually accompanied. However, its role in prostate tumorigenesis and the underlying mechanism are poorly understood.  Methods:   Dual luciferase reporter gene analysis was used to detect miR-203 binding site in insulin receptor substrates 1 (IRS-1). Cell proliferation was assessed by MTT assay in PCa cells with either IRS-1 knockdown or miR-203 overexpression. IRS-1 and other proteins expression in PCa cells was assessed by Western Blot.  Results:   we found that the insulin receptor substrates 1 (IRS-1) is a novel target of miR-203 in PCa and miR-203 can specifically bind to the 3'UTR region of the IRS-1 thus suppresses its expression. Moreover, we demonstrate that miR-203 functions as a tumor suppressor by directly targeting IRS-1 to inhibit cell proliferation and migration which results in PCa cell cycle arrest. Importantly, miR-203 overexpression blocks ERK signalling pathway by down-regulating IRS-1 expression.  Conclusions:   Our results show a novel link between miR-203 and IRS-1, and reveal the importance of strict control of IRS - 1 by miR-203 in the progression of PCa, suggesting miR-203 may act as a promising target for the diagnosis and treatment of advanced PCa.""","""['Yang Meng', 'Xiaoyan Hu', 'Shasha Li', 'Xinyi Zeng', 'Lei Qiu', 'Mingtian Wei', 'Ziqing Wang', 'Junhong Han']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""BMC Cancer""","""['Down-regulation of miR-126 is associated with colorectal cancer cells proliferation, migration and invasion by targeting IRS-1 via the AKT and ERK1/2 signaling pathways.', 'MiR-7 regulates the PI3K/AKT/VEGF pathway of retinal capillary endothelial cell and retinal pericytes in diabetic rat model through IRS-1 and inhibits cell proliferation.', 'miR-539 inhibits prostate cancer progression by directly targeting SPAG5.', ""Nonconserved miR-608 suppresses prostate cancer progression through RAC2/PAK4/LIMK1 and BCL2L1/caspase-3 pathways by targeting the 3'-UTRs of RAC2/BCL2L1 and the coding region of PAK4."", 'miR-326 functions as a tumor suppressor in human prostatic carcinoma by targeting Mucin1.', 'Timing Expression of miR203a-3p during OA Disease: Preliminary In Vitro Evidence.', 'Overexpression of Insulin Receptor Substrate 1 (IRS1) Relates to Poor Prognosis and Promotes Proliferation, Stemness, Migration, and Oxidative Stress Resistance in Cholangiocarcinoma.', 'Comprehensive Analysis of Potential Prognostic Values of ANGPTLs in Colorectal Cancer.', 'Mesenchymal stem cell-derived exosomes as new tools for delivery of miRNAs in the treatment of cancer.', 'Targeting epigenetic regulators for inflammation: Mechanisms and intervention therapy.']"""

However, systematic evaluation on heterogeneous transcriptional responses of different cancer cell types to thousands of independent perturbations in a bioinformatics way is still limited.  Method:   Here, we introduce cancer transcriptome modifying potential (CTMP) which uses ""Connectivity Score"" to quantify and compare the effects of approved antineoplastic drugs on transcriptionally restoring dysregulated (both up- and down-) gene expressions at cancer state towards normal state. As a proof-of-concept, we applied this CTMP computational evaluation on > 10,000 small-molecule compounds using >200,000 Library of Integrated Network-based Cellular Signatures (LINCS) expression profiles generated upon 4 different cancer cell lines. We screened and proposed a candidate list of cancer transcriptome modifying therapeutics (CTMTs), among which the approved on-market drugs are further validated using GDSC drug sensitivity data, highlighting their potential to facilitate direct antineoplastic repositioning.  Results:   In total, we calculated CTMPs of 85 on-market antineoplastic drugs and ~15,000 smallmolecule compounds using 253,813 transcriptomes across four cancer cell lines of lung, melanoma, prostate, and colon. Our results reveal that regardless of the chemical structure and targeted proteins majority of approved antineoplastic drugs present significant bilateral CTMPs across all 4 cancer cell lines. Bilateral CTMP-based systematic screen further indicates that candidate CTMTs are limited and most notably cancer-type specific. In particular, for each cancer cell type we proposed 3~5 CTMTs that are approved drugs with potent sensitivity data to support development in antineoplastic indications.  Conclusion:   Our work establishes CTMP to evaluate the antineoplastic property of small-molecule compounds and suggests CTMP-based systematic screen of cancer type-specific CTMTs as a feasible strategy in drug repositioning for precise anti-cancer purposes.""","""['Yachao Zhao', 'Yang Liu', 'Hui Bai']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Comb Chem High Throughput Screen""","""['Drug Repositioning for Cancer Therapy Based on Large-Scale Drug-Induced Transcriptional Signatures.', 'Application of the Transcriptional Disease Signature (TDSs) to Screen Melanoma-Effective Compounds in a Small Fish Model.', 'Repositioning FDA-Approved Drugs in Combination with Epigenetic Drugs to Reprogram Colon Cancer Epigenome.', 'A Review of Drug Repositioning Based Chemical-induced Cell Line Expression Data.', 'Recent advances in drug repositioning for the discovery of new anticancer drugs.', 'A Mendelian randomization study for drug repurposing reveals bezafibrate and fenofibric acid as potential osteoporosis treatments.', 'Transcriptome-Guided Drug Repurposing for Aggressive SCCs.']"""
