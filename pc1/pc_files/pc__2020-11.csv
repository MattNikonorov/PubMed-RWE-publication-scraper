Therefore, the risk for secondary malignancies should be taken into account. Plans for ten patients were evaluated which had been performed on an Oncentra® treatment planning system for a treatment with an Elekta Synergy™ linac with Agility™ head. The investigated techniques involved IMRT and VMTA with and without flattening filter. Different dose response models were applied for secondary carcinoma and sarcoma risk in the treated region and also in the periphery. As organs at risk we regarded for carcinoma risk urinary bladder, rectum, colon, esophagus, thyroid, and for sarcoma risk bone and soft tissue. The excess absolute risk (EAR) was found very similar in the treated region for both techniques (IMRT and VMAT) and also for both with and without flattening filter. The secondary sarcoma risk resulted about one magnitude smaller than the secondary carcinoma risk. The EAR to the peripheral organs was statistically significant reduced by application of the flattening filter free mode concerning the flattening filter as main source of scattered dose. Application of flattening filter free mode can thus support to reduce second malignancy risk for patients with localized prostate cancer.""","""['Marius Treutwein', 'Rainer Loeschel', 'Matthias Hipp', 'Oliver Koelbl', 'Barbara Dobler']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""J Appl Clin Med Phys""","""['The influence of radiotherapy techniques on the plan quality and on the risk of secondary tumors in patients with pituitary adenoma.', 'Estimation of secondary cancer risk after radiotherapy in high-risk prostate cancer patients with pelvic irradiation.', 'Second cancer risk after radiation therapy of ependymoma using the flattening filter free irradiation mode of a linear accelerator.', 'Volumetric-modulated arc therapy and intensity-modulated radiation therapy treatment planning for prostate cancer with flattened beam and flattening filter free linear accelerators.', 'Radiation-induced second primary cancer risks from modern external beam radiotherapy for early prostate cancer: impact of stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR), volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) and flattening filter free (FFF) radiotherapy.', 'Recommendations for reducing exposure to medical X-ray irradiation (Review).', 'Cellular Damage in the Target and Out-Of-Field Peripheral Organs during VMAT SBRT Prostate Radiotherapy: An In Vitro Phantom-Based Study.', 'Risk for second bladder and rectal malignancies from cervical cancer irradiation.']"""

Methods:   The proportion of 40- to 74-year-old men who self-reported receiving a routine PSA test in the past year was estimated in the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (2012-2018). Odds ratios (ORs) of undergoing screening by race and ethnicity were estimated, adjusting for healthcare-related factors. Prostate cancer incidence rates and rate ratios (IRRs) by race and ethnicity were estimated using Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results registry data (2004-2017).  Results:   PSA testing frequencies were 32.3% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 31.7% to 32.8%) among non-Hispanic White (NHW), 30.3% (95% CI = 28.3% to 32.3%) among non-Hispanic Black (NHB), 21.8% (95% CI = 19.9% to 23.7%) among Hispanic, and 17.7% (95% CI = 14.1% to 21.3%) among Asian and Pacific Islander men in 2012. The absolute screening frequency declined by 9.5% from 2012 to 2018, with a larger decline among NHB (11.6%) than NHW men (9.3%). The relative annual decrease was greater among NHB (OR = 0.86, 95% CI = 0.84 to 0.88) than NHW men (OR = 0.89, 95% CI = 0.89 to 0.90; Pheterogeneity = .005), driven by a larger decline among NHB men ages 40-54 years. The NHB to NHW IRR for total prostate cancer increased from 1.73 (95% CI = 1.69 to 1.76) in 2011 to 1.87 (95% CI = 1.83 to 1.92) in 2012 and has remained elevated, driven by differences in localized tumor incidence. Metastatic disease incidence is rising across all racial and ethnic groups.  Conclusions:   The frequency of prostate cancer screening varies by race and ethnicity, and there was a modestly steeper decline in PSA testing among younger NHB men relative to NHW men since 2012. The NHB to NHW IRR for localized prostate cancer modestly increased following 2012.""","""['Kevin H Kensler', 'Claire H Pernar', 'Brandon A Mahal', 'Paul L Nguyen', 'Quoc-Dien Trinh', 'Adam S Kibel', 'Timothy R Rebbeck']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""J Natl Cancer Inst""","""['Changing Incidence of Metastatic Prostate Cancer by Race and Age, 1988-2015.', 'Does Veteran Status Mitigate Racial Disparities in Prostate Cancer Screening?

Objective:   The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of, and factors associated with, prostate examination among men aged 45 or older.  Design and setting:   Cross-sectional population-based study developed in the city of Rio Grande (RS), Brazil.  Methods:   The outcome of interest was a history of prostate examination (prostate-specific antigen testing or digital rectal examination). The following independent variables were analyzed: age group, skin color, marital status, schooling, economic level, leisure-time physical activity, smoking habits, excessive alcohol consumption, overweight, health insurance, visits to the doctor during the preceding year, hypertension and diabetes. After a two-stage sampling process, the final sample consisted of 281 male individuals.  Results:   The prevalence of a history of prostate-specific antigen testing or digital rectal examination was 68.3% (95% confidence interval (CI): 62.2 to 74.5). The highest prevalence rates were observed among men aged 70 years or older (88%) and the lowest among smokers (36%). The following characteristics were found to be associated with the outcome: advanced age; marital status other than single; more schooling and higher economic status; practicing physical activity; non-smoking habits; overweight; having health insurance; and having visited a doctor during the preceding year.

Clinically, early detection of diverse forms of cancer before they spread and become incurable plays an important role in treatment strategy. Therefore, the development of fast, accurate, sensitive, and low-cost analytical methodologies and techniques for the detection of cancer biomarkers is an attractive research area for scientists globally. Herein, a Schiff base ligand (A1) was prepared via the refluxing of 3-aminobenzoic acid with 1,2-phenylenediamine. After that, a nano Cu complex (N1) was synthesized by reacting A1 with copper chloride. The produced A1 and N1 were characterized using several techniques to determine their physicochemical properties. A density functional theory study was carried out to rationalize the experimental work and support the obtained results. Moreover, the nano Cu complex (N1) was used for the fabrication of a potentiometric membrane biosensor for the early detection of the prostate-specific antigen (PSA). The results reveal that the electrode displays a stable Nernstian response of 29.26 ± 0.87 mV per decade for PSA in a linear dynamic range of 5.0 pg mL-1-10.0 ng mL-1, in a pH range of 6.5-9.2, with a short response time of 25 ± 5 s. The lifetime was between 5-7 weeks under different storage conditions. The detection (LOD) and quantification (LOQ) limits were 0.098 and 0.297 pg mL-1, respectively. The presence of different interfering species on the potentiometric biosensor response against PSA was investigated. The sensing mechanism of N1 toward PSA and the applicability of the developed electrode for the screening and quantification of PSA in real serum samples were also studied.""","""['Magda A Akl', 'El-Sayed R El-Gharkawy', 'Nora A El-Mahdy', 'Said M El-Sheikh', 'Sheta M Sheta']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Dalton Trans""","""['Competitive-type displacement reaction for direct potentiometric detection of low-abundance protein.', 'A novel label-free colorimetric aptasensor for sensitive determination of PSA biomarker using gold nanoparticles and a cationic polymer in human serum.', 'Real-time prostate-specific antigen detection with prostate-specific antigen imprinted capacitive biosensors.', 'Prostate specific antigen.

Our results show that miR-30d-5p is significantly down-regulated in RCC tissues compared with normal tissues. miR-30d-5p overexpression suppressed cell proliferation, cell-cycle G1/S transition and autophagy, but promoted apoptosis in RCC cell lines (786-O and ACHN). Intriguingly, autophagy-related gene 5 (ATG5) was directly targeted by miR-30d-5p, as shown using luciferase reporter assay and biotin-avidin pull-down assay. Moreover, overexpression of ATG5 attenuated the inhibitory effect of miR-30d-5p on proliferation and autophagy in 786-O cells.

However, limited population-based data are available on cancer risk among patients with IPF. Herein, we investigated whether IPF is associated with an increased risk for cancer incidence from a nationwide database in South Korea.  Methods:   In this population-based cohort study, patients with IPF were enrolled from 2009 to 2014, and matched controls were randomly selected at a control-to-case ratio of 3:1. In both groups, individuals diagnosed with any malignancy before the index date were excluded. The incidence rates of cancer were measured as the number of events per 1000 person-years. Multivariable Cox regression models were used to assess the cancer incidence risk.  Results:   This study included 25 241 patients with IPF and 75 723 matched controls. The overall cancer incidence in patients with IPF was 29.0 cases per 1000 person-years, and it was significantly higher in the IPF group than in the non-IPF group (HR, 2.09; 95% CI, 1.96-2.16). Lung cancer showed the highest HR (5.89; 95% CI, 5.40-6.42), followed by lymphoma, skin, uterine cervical, multiple myeloma, thyroid, leukaemia, pancreatic, liver and prostate cancer. Moreover, adjustment for the effects of smoking and other cancer-associated covariates had little effect on the HR of overall and specific cancers.

This approval was based on data from the ongoing multicenter, open-label single-arm trial TRITON2. The primary endpoint, confirmed objective response rate, in the 62 patients who met the above criteria, was 44% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 31%-57%). The median duration of response was not estimable (95% CI: 6.4 to not estimable). Fifty-six percent of patients had a response duration of >6 months and 15% >12 months. The safety profile of rucaparib was generally consistent with that of the class of poly-(ADP-ribose) polymerase enzyme inhibitors and other trials of rucaparib in the treatment of ovarian cancer. Deaths due to adverse events (AEs) occurred in 1.7% of patients, and 8% discontinued rucaparib because of an AE. Grade 3-4 AEs occurred in 59% of patients. No patients with prostate cancer developed myelodysplastic syndrome or acute myeloid leukemia. The trial TRITON3 in patients with mCRPC is ongoing and is planned to verify the clinical benefit of rucaparib in mCRPC. This article summarizes the FDA thought process and data supporting this accelerated approval. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: The accelerated approval of rucaparib for the treatment of adult patients with deleterious BRCA mutation (germline and/or somatic)-associated metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer who have been treated with androgen receptor-directed therapy and a taxane represents the first approved therapy for this selected patient population.

However, manual segmentation of the prostate is subjective and time-consuming. Many deep learning monomodal networks have been developed for automatic whole prostate segmentation from T2-weighted MR images. We aimed to investigate the added value of multimodal networks in segmenting the prostate into the peripheral zone (PZ) and central gland (CG). We optimized and evaluated monomodal DenseVNet, multimodal ScaleNet, and monomodal and multimodal HighRes3DNet, which yielded dice score coefficients (DSC) of 0.875, 0.848, 0.858, and 0.890 in WG, respectively. Multimodal HighRes3DNet and ScaleNet yielded higher DSC with statistical differences in PZ and CG only compared to monomodal DenseVNet, indicating that multimodal networks added value by generating better segmentation between PZ and CG regions but did not improve the WG segmentation. No significant difference was observed in the apex and base of WG segmentation between monomodal and multimodal networks, indicating that the segmentations at the apex and base were more affected by the general network architecture. The number of training data was also varied for DenseVNet and HighRes3DNet, from 20 to 120 in steps of 20. DenseVNet was able to yield DSC of higher than 0.65 even for special cases, such as TURP or abnormal prostate, whereas HighRes3DNet's performance fluctuated with no trend despite being the best network overall. Multimodal networks did not add value in segmenting special cases but generally reduced variations in segmentation compared to the same matched monomodal network.""","""['Ying-Hwey Nai', 'Bernice W Teo', 'Nadya L Tan', 'Koby Yi Wei Chua', 'Chun Kit Wong', ""Sophie O'Doherty"", 'Mary C Stephenson', 'Josh Schaefferkoetter', 'Yee Liang Thian', 'Edmund Chiong', 'Anthonin Reilhac']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Comput Math Methods Med""","""['Fully automatic segmentation on prostate MR images based on cascaded fully convolution network.', 'Automated segmentation of prostate zonal anatomy on T2-weighted (T2W) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) map MR images using U-Nets.', 'A 3D-2D Hybrid U-Net Convolutional Neural Network Approach to Prostate Organ Segmentation of Multiparametric MRI.', 'Machine learning and multiparametric MRI for early diagnosis of prostate cancer.', 'Investigation and benchmarking of U-Nets on prostate segmentation tasks.', 'Development and acceptability validation of a deep learning-based tool for whole-prostate segmentation on multiparametric MRI: a multicenter study.', 'Development and clinical utility analysis of a prostate zonal segmentation model on T2-weighted imaging: a multicenter study.', 'Automatic segmentation of prostate zonal anatomy on MRI: a systematic review of the literature.', 'CAT-Net: A Cross-Slice Attention Transformer Model for Prostate Zonal Segmentation in MRI.', 'Artificial Intelligence Segmentation Algorithm-Based Optical Coherence Tomography Image in Evaluation of Binocular Retinopathy.']"""

Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are essential in the tumor microenvironment. We intended to study the role of CAF-derived exosomes in the context of PC and the potential regulatory mechanism associated with miR-423-5p and GREM2. CAF-derived exosomes decreased the chemosensitivity of parental PC cells and enhanced the drug resistance of drug-resistant cells. PC-associated fibroblast-derived exosomes carrying miR-423-5p increased the resistance of PC to taxane by inhibiting GREM2 through the TGF-β pathway. Inhibition of the TGF-β pathway partially reversed the increased drug resistance in PC cells induced by CAF-derived exosomes.

Here, we establish that MCL1 has a direct role in controlling p73 transcriptional activity, which modulates target genes associated with DNA damage response, apoptosis, and cell cycle progression. This interaction is mediated through the reverse BH3 (rBH3) motif in the p73 tetramerization domain, which restricts p73 assembly on DNA. Here, we provide a novel mechanism for protein-level regulation of p73 transcriptional activity by MCL1, while also framing a foundation for studying MCL1 inhibitors in combination with platinum-based chemotherapeutics.

Multiple studies have attempted to find factors that may predict early recovery of urinary continence in surgically treated patients. The aim of this study is to evaluate the ability of the length of the membranous urethra (LUM) and the intraprostatic urethra (IUL) measured in preoperative by multiparametric prostate resonance imaging (MRI), to predict post-radical prostatectomy urinary continence. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A retrospective study between 2016 and 2018 was conducted. Patients who under went laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (LRP) and had a previous RMI were included. Different variables were evaluated: age, PSA, BMI, clinical and pathological stage, and the validated questionnaire of urinary incontinence (ICIQ-SF) was performed at 12 months postoperatively. LUM and LUIP were calculated and compared groups (continence vs incontinence) using the Student test (t). A value of p<0.05 was taken as significant. A ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) curve was made to predict continence according to LUM and LUIP. RESULTS: Forty-four patients were included. Mean age was 63 years (SD±7.2) and mean PSA was 9.2 ng/dL (SD±5.2). Seventy-five percent presented clinical stageT1c and 43.2% pathological stage pT2cN0. 20.5% (9 patients) presented some degree of UI. The mean LUM was 15.1 mm (SD±5.6) and LUIP 26 mm (SD±10.4). For patients with continence and incontinence, the mean LUM was 18.3 vs 9.5 mm (p=0.0001) and LUIP 31.5vs 15 mm (p=0.0001) respectively. The area under the curve taking as a value of LUM >10mm was 88% and LUIP>20mm was 86.7%. CONCLUSION: The use of preoperative mp RMN measurement of urethral membrane length and intraprostatic urethra may be useful in significantly predicting post-PR urinary continence.""","""['Luis Rico', 'Gonzalo Vitagliano', 'Francisco Miguel López', 'Hernando Rios Pita', 'Nicolás Bonanno', 'Miguel Eduardo Nazar', 'Carlos Ameri', 'Leandro Blas']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Arch Esp Urol""","""['Relationship between recovery of urinary continence after laparoscopic radical prostatectomy and preoperative/postoperative membranous urethral length.', 'Association Between Preoperative Magnetic Resonance Imaging-based Urethral Parameters and Continence Recovery Following Robot-assisted Radical Prostatectomy.', 'Impact of Preoperative Magnetic Resonance Imaging Anatomic Features on Urinary Continence Recovery after Laparoscopic Radical Prostatectomy.', 'Preoperative Membranous Urethral Length Measurement and Continence Recovery Following Radical Prostatectomy: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.', 'Value of Different Magnetic Resonance Imaging-based Measurements of Anatomical Structures on Preoperative Prostate Imaging in Predicting Urinary Continence After Radical Prostatectomy in Men with Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.', 'Prediction of Postradical Prostatectomy Urinary Incontinence Through the Combination of the Urethral Pressure Profile With Electromyography of the Urethral Sphincter.']"""

Therefore, structure-activity relationship of 1-3 was studied by performing ct-DNA binding, pBR322 cleavage and cytotoxicity activity to validate their potential to act as chemotherapeutic drug entities. The binding studies of 1-3 with ct- DNA were carried out employing many biophysical techniques and the corroborative results of these experiments showed intercalation mode of binding and the order of binding was found to be 2 > 1 > 3. The structure of drug entities could facilitated strong halogen bonding interaction (in case of 1 &2) and stability of X bond was rationalized by sigma hole region of positive electrostatic potential on the surface of C-X covalent bond, as determined by gas phase B3LYP computational DFT studies. Interestingly, 2 exhibited most avid binding affinity due to presence of Br- electron withdrawing and polarizable group. Further, cleavage studies of 1-3 with pBR322 plasmid DNA were performed which demonstrated significant cleavage activity, the supercoiled form (Form I) of plasmid DNA was converted to nicked form (Form II) with the appearance of linearized form (Form III) in between two, implicating lethal double strand breaks of DNA. 2 showed predominantly higher cleavage activity following the similar trend as observed for binding studies. The cytotoxicity of the complexes 1-3 was evaluated by MTT assay against the human liver carcinoma (Huh-7) and prostate cancer (DU-145) cell lines; complex 2 exhibited specific and selective cytotoxicity for the DU-145 cancer cell line with LC50 value of 1.6 μM.""","""['Farukh Arjmand', 'Salman Khursheed', 'Thierry Roisnel', 'Hifzur R Siddique']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Bioorg Chem""","""['Structure elucidation {spectroscopic, single crystal X-ray diffraction and computational DFT studies} of new tailored benzenesulfonamide derived Schiff base copper(II) intercalating complexes: Comprehensive biological profile {DNA binding, pBR322 DNA cleavage, Topo I inhibition and cytotoxic activity}.', ""Platinum(II) and Copper(II) complexes of asymmetric halogen-substituted NN'O ligands: Synthesis, characterization, structural investigations and antiproliferative activity."", 'Mechanistic insights into a novel chromone-appended Cu(II) anticancer drug entity: in vitro binding profile with DNA/RNA substrates and cytotoxic activity against MCF-7 and HepG2 cancer cells.', 'Progress of Metal-Based Anticancer Chemotherapeutic Agents in Last two Decades and their Comprehensive Biological (DNA/RNA Binding, Cleavage and Cytotoxicity Activity) Studies.', 'Chromones: Privileged scaffold in anticancer drug discovery.', 'Ru(II)(ƞ6-p-cymene) Conjugates Loaded onto Graphene Oxide: An Effective pH-Responsive Anticancer Drug Delivery System.', 'Synthesis and Structural Characterization of CaO-P2O5-CaF:CuO Glasses with Antitumoral Effect on Skin Cancer Cells.']"""

Our purpose in these studies was to perform hypoxia theranostics by combining in vivo hypoxia imaging and hypoxic cancer cell targeting in a human prostate cancer xenograft. This was achieved by engineering PC3 human prostate cancer cells to express luciferase as well as a prodrug enzyme, yeast cytosine deaminase, under control of hypoxic response elements (HREs). Cancer cells display an adaptive response to hypoxia through the activation of several genes mediated by the binding of hypoxia inducible factors (HIFs) to HRE in the promoter region of target gene that results in their increased transcription. HIFs promote key steps in tumorigenesis, including angiogenesis, metabolism, proliferation, metastasis, and differentiation. HRE-driven luciferase expression allowed us to detect hypoxia in vivo to time the administration of the nontoxic prodrug 5-fluorocytosine that was converted by yeast cytosine deaminase, expressed under HRE regulation, to the chemotherapy agent 5-fluorouracil to target hypoxic cells. Conversion of 5-fluorocytosine to 5-fluorouracil was detected in vivo by 19F magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Morphological and immunohistochemical staining and molecular analyses were performed to characterize tumor microenvironment changes in cancer-associated fibroblasts, cell viability, collagen 1 fiber patterns, and HIF-1α.

Methods:   An African American-enriched multiinstitutional cohort of 726 PCa patients consisting of both African American men (AAM; n = 254) and European American men (EAM; n = 472) was used in the analyses. Methods of categorical analysis were used. Messenger RNA (mRNA) expression differences between anterior and posterior tumor lesions were analyzed using Wilcoxon rank-sum tests with multiple comparison corrections.  Results:   Anti-ERG immunohistochemistry staining showed that the association between ERG status and anterior tumors is independent of race and is consistently robust for both AAM (ERGnegative 81.4% vs. ERGpositive 18.6%; p = .005) and EAM (ERGnegative 60.4% vs. ERGpositive 39.6%; p < .001). In a multivariable model, anterior tumors were more likely to be IHC-ERGnegative (odds ratio [OR]: 3.20; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.14-4.78; p < .001). IHC-ERGnegative were also more likely to have high-grade tumors (OR: 1.73; 95% CI: 1.06-2.82; p = .02). In the exploratory genomic analysis, mRNA expression of location-dependent genes is highly influenced by ERG status and African American race. However, tumor location did not impact the expression of AR or the major canonical AR-target genes (KLK3, AMACR, and MYC).

This treatment has a novel chemical structure that may also have safety, tolerability, and efficacy advantages for men with nmCRPC. OBJECTIVE: To estimate the projected budget impact of including darolutamide on a U.S. payer formulary as a treatment option for men with nmCRPC. METHODS: A budget impact model was developed to evaluate darolutamide for nmCRPC for a hypothetical 1-million-member plan over a 5-year period. Costs (drug acquisition, drug administration, and treatment-related adverse events [AEs]) were estimated for 2 scenarios: with and without darolutamide treatment for nmCRPC. The budget impact of darolutamide was calculated as the difference in costs for these 2 scenarios. An analysis for high-risk nmCRPC also was conducted. The model included treatments recommended by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (e.g., apalutamide and enzalutamide) and potential comparators that are used but are not specifically indicated for nmCRPC. All treatments were assumed to be administered in combination with a weighted average androgen deprivation therapy comparator (consisting of luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone [LHRH] agonists, LHRH antagonists, and first-generation antiandrogens). Market share estimates were derived from interviews with physicians treating men with nmCRPC. The model includes grade 3-4 AEs, and the rates were obtained from clinical trial data. Costs were taken from publicly available sources and varied in a one-way sensitivity analysis. RESULTS: For a plan with 1 million lives, there were approximately 90 incident cases of nmCRPC (46 high risk) each year, with 332 (109 high risk) treatment-eligible cases by year 5. Darolutamide's market share increased from 3.6% in year 1 to 18% in year 5. Given the utilization of other agents, introducing darolutamide along with other targeted therapies was predicted to increase the total budget by $158,640 ($0.0132 per member per month [PMPM]) in year 1, which decreased over time to a cost savings of $149,240 ($0.0124 PMPM) by year 5. The scenario with darolutamide showed reduced AE costs each year. Similar results were observed for the high-risk nmCRPC population. CONCLUSIONS: Adding darolutamide to a U.S. payer formulary for the treatment of nmCRPC can result in a manageable increase in the budget that is partly offset by AE costs in the first 4 years, followed by a cost savings by year 5.

Methods:   This single-institution, retrospective study included all patients with treatment-naïve prostate cancer referred to whole-body MRI during 2016 and 2017. All were eligible for a metastatic workup according to the guidelines: PSA > 20 ng/ml and/or Gleason grade group ≥ 3 and/or cT ≥ 2c and/or bone symptoms. The definition of a metastasis was descriptive and based on the original MRI reports. The anatomical location of metastases was registered.  Results:   We included 161 patients with newly diagnosed prostate cancer of which 36 (22%) were intermediate-risk and 125 (78%) were high-risk. The median age and PSA were 71 years (IQR 64-76) and 13 ng/ml (IQR 8-28), respectively. Bone metastases were found in 12 patients (7%, 95% CI: 4-13), and all were high-risk with Gleason grade group ≥ 4. The pelvis was affected in 4 patients, and the spine + pelvis in the remaining 8. No patients demonstrated metastases to the spine without concomitant metastases in the pelvis. Limitations are the small number of metastases and retrospective design.  Conclusion:   This study suggests that the overall prevalence of bone metastases using the current guidelines for screening is quite low. No metastases were seen in the case of Gleason grade group ≤ 3, and further studies should investigate if it necessary to screen non-high-risk patients.  Key points:   • The overall prevalence of bone metastases was 7% in the case of newly diagnosed intermediate- and high-risk prostate cancer. • The prevalence in high-risk patients was 10%, and no metastases were seen in patients with Gleason grade group ≤ 3. • The pelvic skeleton is the main site, and no metastases occurred in the spine without concomitant pelvic metastases.""","""['Fredrik Ottosson', 'Eduard Baco', 'Peter M Lauritzen', 'Erik Rud']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Eur Radiol""","""['Validating the screening criteria for bone metastases in treatment-naïve unfavorable intermediate and high-risk prostate cancer - the prevalence and location of bone- and lymph node metastases.', 'More advantages in detecting bone and soft tissue metastases from prostate cancer using 18F-PSMA PET/CT.', 'Establishing the pathways and indications for performing isotope bone scans in newly diagnosed intermediate-risk localised prostate cancer - results from a large contemporaneous cohort.', 'Metastatic prostate cancer incidence in Australia after amendment to prostate-specific antigen screening guidelines.', 'Yield of bone scintigraphy for the detection of metastatic disease in treatment-naive prostate cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Potential biomarkers for the early detection of bone metastases.', 'Management of bone metastasis in prostate cancer.', 'Establishment and validation of a predictive model for bone metastasis in prostate cancer patients based on multiple immune inflammatory parameters.', 'Validating the screening criteria for bone metastases in treatment-naïve unfavorable intermediate and high-risk prostate cancer - the prevalence and location of bone- and lymph node metastases.', 'Detection of Bone Metastases on Bone Scans through Image Classification with Contrastive Learning.']"""

These structures can sense the environment and play key roles in migration and cell-cell interactions. The growth-retraction cycle of filopodia is a complex process exquisitely regulated by intra- and extra-cellular cues, whose nature remains elusive. Filopodia present wide variation in length, lifetime and growth rate. Here, we investigate the features of filopodia patterns in fixed prostate tumor cells by confocal microscopy. Analysis of almost a thousand filopodia suggests the presence of two different populations: one characterized by a narrow distribution of lengths and the other with a much more variable pattern with very long filopodia. We explore a stochastic model of filopodial growth which takes into account diffusion and reactions involving actin and the regulatory proteins formin and capping, and retrograde flow. Interestingly, we found an inverse dependence between the filopodial length and the retrograde velocity. This result led us to propose that variations in the retrograde velocity could explain the experimental lengths observed for these tumor cells. In this sense, one population involves a wider range of retrograde velocities than the other population, and also includes low values of this velocity. It has been hypothesized that cells would be able to regulate retrograde flow as a mechanism to control filopodial length. Thus, we propound that the experimental filopodia pattern is the result of differential retrograde velocities originated from heterogeneous signaling due to cell-substrate interactions or prior cell-cell contacts.""","""['Daniela Senra', 'Alejandra Páez', 'Geraldine Gueron', 'Luciana Bruno', 'Nara Guisoni']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Eur Biophys J""","""['Molecular noise of capping protein binding induces macroscopic instability in filopodial dynamics.', 'The stochastic dynamics of filopodial growth.', 'Filopodial retraction force is generated by cortical actin dynamics and controlled by reversible tethering at the tip.', 'An updated look at actin dynamics in filopodia.', 'The clutch hypothesis revisited: ascribing the roles of actin-associated proteins in filopodial protrusion in the nerve growth cone.']"""

Objective:   To compare clinical outcomes of African American and non-Hispanic White men with low-risk prostate cancer managed with active surveillance.  Design, setting, and participants:   Retrospective cohort study in the US Veterans Health Administration Health Care System of African American and non-Hispanic White men diagnosed with low-risk prostate cancer between January 1, 2001, and December 31, 2015, and managed with active surveillance. The date of final follow-up was March 31, 2020.  Exposures:   Active surveillance was defined as no definitive treatment within the first year of diagnosis and at least 1 additional surveillance biopsy.  Main outcomes and measures:   Progression to at least intermediate-risk, definitive treatment, metastasis, prostate cancer-specific mortality, and all-cause mortality.  Results:   The cohort included 8726 men, including 2280 African American men (26.1%) (median age, 63.2 years) and 6446 non-Hispanic White men (73.9%) (median age, 65.5 years), and the median follow-up was 7.6 years (interquartile range, 5.7-9.9; range, 0.2-19.2).

Additionally, the inhibition of matrix metalloproteinase activity, altered cytokine and growth factor expression, as well as reductions in parameters of pain have also been reported. In humans, clinical BP use has transformed the treatment of post-menopausal osteoporosis, rare bone diseases such as osteogenesis imperfecta, as well as multiple myeloma and metastatic breast and prostate cancer, albeit not without infrequent but significant adverse events.

Notwithstanding, BPs are used widely in small animal veterinary practice for the medical management of hyperparathyroidism, idiopathic hypercalcemia in cats, as well as for the palliative care of bone tumors which are common in dogs, and in particular, primary bone tumors such as osteosarcoma. Palliative BP treatment has also recently increased in veterinary oncology to alleviate tumor-associated bone pain. In equine veterinary practice, non-nitrogen-containing BPs are FDA-approved to control clinical signs associated with navicular syndrome in adult horses.

Lessons learned from small intestine neuroendocrine tumors suggest that CDKN1B mutations could be subclonal, raising the question of whether a deeper sequencing approach could lead to the identification of higher numbers of patients with mutations. Here, we addressed this question and analyzed human cancer biopsies from breast (n = 396), ovarian (n = 110) and head and neck squamous carcinoma (n = 202) patients, using an ultra-deep sequencing approach. Notwithstanding this effort, the mutation rate of CDKN1B remained substantially aligned with values from the literature, showing that essentially only hormone receptor-positive breast cancer displayed CDKN1B mutations in a relevant number of cases (3%). However, the analysis of copy number variation showed that another fraction of luminal breast cancer displayed loss (8%) or gain (6%) of the CDKN1B gene, further reinforcing the idea that the function of p27kip1 is important in this type of tumor. Intriguingly, an enrichment for CDKN1B alterations was found in samples from premenopausal luminal breast cancer patients (n = 227, 4%) and in circulating cell-free DNA from metastatic luminal breast cancer patients (n = 59, 8.5%), suggesting that CDKN1B alterations could correlate with tumor aggressiveness and/or occur later during disease progression. Notably, many of the identified somatic mutations resulted in p27kip1 protein truncation, leading to loss of most of the protein or of its C-terminal domain. Using a gene-editing approach in a luminal breast cancer cell line, MCF-7, we observed that the expression of p27kip1 truncating mutants that lose the C-terminal domains failed to rescue most of the phenotypes induced by CDKN1B gene knockout, indicating that the functions retained by the C-terminal portion are critical for its role as an oncosuppressor, at least in luminal breast cancer. © 2020 The Authors.

To our knowledge, this phenomena had not been reported previously and the mechanism remains unknown. Here, we report some initial observations that provide new insights into zinc processing during glucose-stimulated zinc secretion (GSZS) in the immortalized human prostate epithelial cell line, PNT1A. Additionally, we identified the subtypes of zinc-containing cells in human benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) tissue to further identify which cell types are likely responsible for zinc release in vivo.  Procedure:   An intracellular fluorescence marker, FluoZin-1-AM, was used to assess the different roles of ZnT1 and ZnT4 in zinc homeostasis in wild type (WT) and mRNA knockdown PNT1A cell lines. Additionally, Bafilomycin A1 (Baf) was used to disrupt lysosomes and assess the role of lysosomal storage during GSZS. ZIMIR, an extracellular zinc-responsive fluorescent marker, was used to assess dynamic zinc efflux of WT and ZnT1 mRNA knockdown cells exposed to high glucose. Electron microscopy was used to assess intracellular zinc storage in response to high glucose and evaluate how Bafilomycin A1 affects zinc trafficking. BPH cells were harvested from transurtheral prostatectomy tissue and stained with fluorescent zinc granule indicator (ZIGIR), an intracellular zinc-responsive fluorescent marker, before being sorted for cell types using flow cytometry.  Results:   Fluorescent studies demonstrate that ZnT1 is the major zinc efflux transporter in prostate epithelial cells and that loss of ZnT1 via mRNA knockdown combined with lysosomal storage disruption results in a nearly 4-fold increase in cytosolic zinc. Knockdown of ZnT1 dramatically reduces zinc efflux during GSZS. Electron microscopy (EM) reveals that glucose stimulation significantly increases lysosomal storage of zinc; disruption of lysosomes via Baf or ZnT4 mRNA knockdown increases multi-vesicular body (MVB) formation and cytosolic zinc levels. In human BPH tissue, only the luminal epithelial cells contained significant amounts of zinc storage granules.  Conclusions:   Exposure of prostate epithelial cells to high glucose alters zinc homeostasis by inducing efflux of zinc ions via ZnT1 channels and increasing lysosomal storage via ZnT4. Given that prostate cancer cells undergo profound metabolic changes that result in reduced levels of total zinc, understanding the complex interplay between glucose exposure and zinc homeostasis in the prostate may provide new insights into the development of prostate carcinogenesis.""","""['Su-Tang Lo', 'Daniel Parrott', 'M Veronica Clavijo Jordan', 'Diya Binoy Joseph', 'Douglas Strand', 'U-Ging Lo', 'Ho Lin', 'Anza Darehshouri', 'A Dean Sherry']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Mol Imaging Biol""","""['Investigations into the Signaling Pathways Involving Glucose-Stimulated Zinc Secretion (GSZS) from Prostate Epithelial Cells In Vitro and In Vivo.', 'Cooperative functions of ZnT1, metallothionein and ZnT4 in the cytoplasm are required for full activation of TNAP in the early secretory pathway.', 'Zinc transporter 1 (ZNT1) expression on the cell surface is elaborately controlled by cellular zinc levels.', 'Efflux and compartmentalization of zinc by members of the SLC30 family of solute carriers.', 'Dietary zinc absorption: A play of Zips and ZnTs in the gut.', 'Investigations into the Signaling Pathways Involving Glucose-Stimulated Zinc Secretion (GSZS) from Prostate Epithelial Cells In Vitro and In Vivo.', 'Using micro-synchrotron radiation x-ray fluorescence (µ-SRXRF) for trace metal imaging in the development of MRI contrast agents for prostate cancer imaging.', 'Carbon sources and pathways for citrate secreted by human prostate cancer cells determined by NMR tracing and metabolic modeling.', 'Imaging Beta-Cell Function in the Pancreas of Non-Human Primates Using a Zinc-Sensitive MRI Contrast Agent.']"""

However, CRPC patients eventually develop Enz-resistance that may involve the induction of the androgen receptor (AR) splicing variant ARv7. Here we found that Cisplatin (Cis) or Carboplatin, currently used in chemotherapy/radiation therapy to suppress tumor progression, could restore the Enz sensitivity in multiple Enz-resistant (EnzR) CRPC cells via directly degrading/suppressing the ARv7. Combining Cis or Carboplatin with Enz therapy can also delay the development of Enz-resistance in CRPC C4-2 cells. Mechanism dissection found that Cis or Carboplatin might decrease the ARv7 expression via multiple mechanisms including targeting the lncRNA-Malat1/SF2 RNA splicing complex and increasing ARv7 degradation via altering ubiquitination. Preclinical studies using in vivo mouse model with implanted EnzR1-C4-2 cells also demonstrated that Cis plus Enz therapy resulted in better suppression of EnzR CRPC progression than Enz treatment alone.

Methods:   Thirty patients who were prescribed 50-54Gy to the pelvic lymph nodes (PLN) and 78Gy to the prostate/seminal vesicles were included. Daily acquired CBCTs were rigidly registered to the CT using BA and PRO to simulate two different treatment positions. The accumulated delivered dose (DAcc) of PLN, prostate, bladder and rectum for each surrogate were compared with the planned dose. Deviation from the planned dose (ΔDAcc-Plan) of >5% was considered clinically significant.  Results:   Prostate was displaced from bony anatomy by > 5 mm in 96/755 fractions (12.7%). Deviation between the mean DAcc and the planned dose for PLN and prostate was <2% when either BA or PRO was used. No significant deviation from planned dose was observed for bladder (p > 0.2). In contrary, DAcc for rectum D50 was significantly greater than the planned dose when BA was used (Mean ΔDAcc-Plan = 6%). When examining individual patient, deviation from the planned dose for rectum D50 was clinically significant for 18 patients for BA (Range: 5-21%) and only 8 patients for PRO (Range: 5-8%).

Our aim was to investigate the molecular mechanism of AFAP1-AS1 in PTX resistance in PCa. The levels of AFAP1-AS1, miR-195-5p, and FKBP1A were checked by qRT-PCR. 3-(4, 5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-Diphenyltetrazolium Bromide (MTT) assay was employed to assess the resistance of PTX-resistant PCa cells to PTX. Flow cytometry was introduced to evaluate cell apoptosis. The protein levels of C-caspase 3 were determined by western blot. The starBase was used to predict the interaction between miR-195-5p and AFAP1-AS1. Xenograft tumor model was established to investigate the biological role of AFAP1-AS1 in PTX resistance in vivo. The levels of AFAP1-AS1 and FKBP1A were upregulated in PCa tissues and cells, as well as PTX-resistant PCa cells, while the expression of miR-195-5p was declined. Knockdown of AFAP1-AS1 promoted the sensitivity of PTX-resistant PCa cells to PTX, induced apoptosis of PTX-resistant PCa cells, whereas the impacts could be reversed by reducing the expression of miR-195-5p. FKBP1A overexpression could rescue the effects of miR-195-5p-mediated enhancement on the sensitivity of PTX-resistant PCa cells to PTX, promotion on apoptosis of PTX-resistant PCa cells. AFAP1-AS1 interacted with miR-195-5p and miR-195-5p could bind to the 3'UTR of FKBP1A. AFAP1-AS1 silencing inhibited the tumor growth in mice implanted with PC3-TXR cell. The protein level of PCNA was decreased in PC3-TXR cells transfected with sh-AFAP1-AS1, while the expression of C-caspase 3 was upregulated.

However, it causes noise and artifacts in the reconstructed images due to the lower number of acquired projection data. The purpose of this study is to improve the image quality of high-speed CBCT using a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN).  Methods:   CBCT images of 36 prostate cancer patients were selected. The CBCT images acquired at normal scan speed were defined as CBCT100%. Simulated high-speed CBCT images acquired at twofold and fourfold scan speed were created, which were defined as CBCT50% and CBCT25%, respectively. The image quality of the CBCT50% was treated as the requirement for IGRT in this study because previous studies reported that its image is sufficient with respect to IGRT. The DCNN model was trained to learn direct mapping from CBCT25% to the corresponding CBCT100%. The performance of the DCNN model was evaluated using the sixfold cross-validation method. CBCT images generated by DCNN (CBCT25%+DCNN) were evaluated for voxel value accuracy and image quality.  Results:   The DCNN model can process CBCT25% of a new patient within 0.06 s/slice. The CBCT25%+DCNN was comparable to the CBCT50% in terms of both voxel value accuracy and image quality.  Conclusions:   We developed a DCNN model to remove noise and artifacts from high-speed CBCT.

Optical techniques such as optical absorbance, scattering, surface plasmon resonance (SPR), and fluorescence have been extensively employed for Cancer diagnostic applications. One of the most important diagnostic applications involves utilization of nanoparticles (NPs) for highly specific, sensitive, rapid, multiplexed, and high performance Cancer detection and quantification. The incorporation of NPs with these optical biosensing techniques allow realization of low cost, point-of-care, highly sensitive, and specific early cancer detection technologies, especially for PCa.

These HRQOL impairments may be especially pronounced in rural areas, where older adults have higher cancer burden and more comorbidities and risk factors for poor health. This study aimed to assess rural-urban differences in HRQOL for older cancer survivors and controls.  Methods:   Data came from Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-Medicare Health Outcomes Survey (SEER-MHOS), which links cancer incidence from 18 U.S. population-based cancer registries to survey data for Medicare Advantage Organization enrollees (1998-2014). HRQOL measures were 8 standardized subscales and 2 global summary measures. We matched (2:1) controls to breast, colorectal, lung, and prostate cancer survivors, creating an analytic dataset of 271,640 participants (ages 65+). HRQOL measures were analyzed with linear regression models including multiplicative interaction terms (rurality by cancer status), controlling for sociodemographics, cohort, and multimorbidities.  Results:   HRQOL scores were higher in urban than rural areas (e.g., global physical component summary score for breast cancer survivors: urban mean = 38.7, standard error [SE] = 0.08; rural mean = 37.9, SE = 0.32; p < 0.05), and were generally lower among cancer survivors compared to controls. Rural cancer survivors had particularly poor vitality (colorectal: p = 0.05), social functioning (lung: p = 0.05), role limitation-physical (prostate: p < 0.01), role limitation-emotional (prostate: p < 0.01), and global mental component summary (prostate: p = 0.02).  Conclusion:   Supportive interventions are needed to increase physical, social, and emotional HRQOL among older cancer survivors in rural areas. These interventions could target cancer-related stigma (particularly for lung and prostate cancers) and/or access to screening, treatment, and ancillary healthcare resources.""","""['Jennifer L Moss', 'Casey N Pinto', 'Scherezade K Mama', 'Maria Rincon', 'Erin E Kent', 'Mandi Yu', 'Kathleen A Cronin']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Qual Life Res""","""['Health-related quality of life among cancer survivors in rural China.', 'Trends in Racial/Ethnic Disparity of Health-Related Quality of Life in Older Adults with and without Cancer (1998-2012).', 'Association of falls with health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in older cancer survivors: A population based study.', 'Health-related quality of life among long-term (≥5\xa0years) prostate cancer survivors by primary intervention: a systematic review.', 'Exercise interventions on health-related quality of life for people with cancer during active treatment.', 'Research-practice partnership: supporting rural cancer survivors in Montana.', 'Rural resilience during COVID-19: the lived experience of North Carolinian rural-dwelling cancer caregivers.', 'Physical activity, obesity, and quality of life among rural Australian cancer survivors: a cross-sectional study.', 'Effect of Psychosocial, Behavioral, and Disease Characteristics on Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) After Breast Cancer Surgery: A Cross-Sectional Study of a Regional Australian Population.', 'A Rapid Systematic Review on the Experiences of Cancer Survivors Residing in Rural Areas during the COVID-19 Pandemic.']"""

Materials and methods:   This retrospective analysis included 114 patients who underwent biopsy after completion of the PHI from November 2018 to July 2019. Various parameters such as PSA, PHI, PSA density, free PSA, p2PSA, and %free PSA were collected, and correlations with biopsy Gleason score and cancer detection rates were investigated.  Results:   Baseline characteristics were comparable between PHI groups (0-26.9 [n=11], 27.0-35.9 [n=17], 36.0-54.9 [n=50], and ≥55.0 [n=36]). A total of 37 patients (32.5%) were diagnosed with prostate cancer, and 28 (24.6%) were diagnosed with clinically significant prostate cancer (CSPC, Gleason score ≥7) after prostate biopsy. The cancer detection rate gradually increased with a corresponding increase in the PHI (18%, 24%, 30%, and 44%, respectively).

Methods:   A total of 261,125 patients diagnosed with prostate cancer (PCa) were selected between 2005 and 2015 from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database. We used propensity score matching to balance clinical variables and then compared overall survival (OS) and cancer-specific survival (CSS) between Gleason score subgroups. We further establish a new Gleason survival grading system based on the hazard ratio (HR) values of each Gleason subgroup. Cox proportional hazards models and Kaplan-Meier curves were used to compare patient survival.  Results:   Among PCa patients with Gleason score 8 disease, patients with Gleason 5 + 3 had significantly worse OS and CSS than those with Gleason 3 + 5 (OS: HR = 1.26, p = 0.042; CSS: HR = 1.42, p = 0.005) and 4 + 4 (HR = 1.50 for OS and HR = 1.69 for CSS, p < 0.001 for all). PCa patients with Gleason 5 + 3 and Gleason 4 + 5 may have the similar OS and CSS (reference Gleason score <=6, 5 + 3: OS HR = 2.44, CSS HR = 7.63; 4 + 5: OS HR = 2.40, CSS HR = 8.92; p < 0.001 for all). The new Gleason survival grading system reclassified the grades 4 and 5 of the 2014 updated Gleason grading system into three hierarchical grades, which makes the classification of grades more detailed and accurate.  Conclusion:   PCa patients with Gleason 8-10 may have three different survival subgroups, Gleason 3 + 5 and 4 + 4, Gleason 5 + 3 and 4 + 5, and Gleason 5 + 4 and 5 + 5.

Prior studies of the effect of testosterone treatment on PSA concentrations have been conducted in men who were mildly to moderately hypogonadal.  Objective:   The objective of this work is to determine the PSA response to testosterone treatment of men who are severely hypogonadal.  Design and setting:   This retrospective cohort study was conducted at a single academic medical center.  Participants:   Eighty-five men participated who were severely hypogonadal as a result hypothalamic-pituitary or testicular disease.  Main outcome measure:   Changes in serum PSA concentrations were measured during testosterone treatment for up to 18 months.  Results:   Testosterone treatment increased the median serum testosterone concentration from 36 ng/dL (interquartile range [IQR], 20-91 ng/dL) at baseline to 395 ng/dL (IQR, 266-542 ng/dL) at 6 to 18 months. This treatment resulted in a median increment in PSA above baseline of 0.70 ng/mL (IQR, 0.10-1.85 ng/mL) at 6 to 18 months. Apropos current Endocrine Society clinical guidelines, 31% of the men experienced a PSA increase above baseline greater than 1.4 ng/mL, and 13% reached an absolute PSA concentration of greater than 4.0 ng/mL. Four men were diagnosed with prostate cancer.  Conclusions:   The PSA response to testosterone replacement in men who are severely hypogonadal as a result of pituitary or testicular disease is greater than that previously reported in men with mild to moderate hypogonadism.

Cancer cell adhesion and migration towards nerve cells (snF96.2 or NS20Y) was examined by co-culture assays. Conditioned media (CM) collected from C4-2 cells was cultured with nerve cells (PC-12 or NS20Y) for 48 h followed by qualitative or quantitative neurite outgrowth assay. Our results showed that cancer cells expressing high levels of Snail (LNCaP Snail/C4-2 NS) displayed significantly higher migration adherence to nerve cells, compared to cells with lower levels of Snail (LNCaP Neo/C4-2 Snail shRNA). Additionally, LNCaP Snail or C4-2 NS (Snail-high) CM led to a higher neurite outgrowth compared to the LNCaP Neo or C4-2 Snail shRNA (Snail-low). In conclusion, Snail promotes migration and adhesion to nerve cells, as well as neurite outgrowth via secretion of soluble factors. Therefore, targeting cancer cell interaction with nerves may contribute to halting prostate cancer progression/metastasis.""","""['Gabrielle Edwards', 'Taaliah Campbell', 'Veronica Henderson', 'Alira Danaher', 'Daqing Wu', 'Rekha Srinivasan', 'Khosrow Rezvani', 'Valerie A Odero-Marah']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Biochimie""","""['Snail negatively regulates cell adhesion to extracellular matrix and integrin expression via the MAPK pathway in prostate cancer cells.', 'Snail promotes cell migration through PI3K/AKT-dependent Rac1 activation as well as PI3K/AKT-independent pathways during prostate cancer progression.', 'Snail transcription factor negatively regulates maspin tumor suppressor in human prostate cancer cells.', 'Muscadine grape skin extract can antagonize Snail-cathepsin L-mediated invasion, migration and osteoclastogenesis in prostate and breast cancer cells.', 'The role of Snail in prostate cancer.', 'CHST2-mediated sulfation of MECA79 antigens is critical for breast cancer cell migration and metastasis.', 'UBXN2A suppresses the Rictor-mTORC2 signaling pathway, an established tumorigenic pathway in human colorectal cancer.', 'Enhancing Anti-Tumorigenic Efficacy of Eugenol in Human Colon Cancer Cells Using Enzyme-Responsive Nanoparticles.', 'An Overview of the Molecular Cues and Their Intracellular Signaling Shared by Cancer and the Nervous System: From Neurotransmitters to Synaptic Proteins, Anatomy of an All-Inclusive Cooperation.', 'The Role of Perineural Invasion in Prostate Cancer and Its Prognostic Significance.']"""

The American Brachytherapy Society (ABS) leadership has recognized the need to establish a sustainable medical simulation low-dose-rate (LDR) and high-dose-rate (HDR) brachytherapy workshop program that includes physician-physicist teams to rapidly translate knowledge to establish high-quality brachytherapy programs.  Methods:   The ABS, in partnership with industry and academia, has held three radiation oncology team-based LDR/HDR workshops composed of physician-physicist teams in Chicago in 2017, in Houston in 2018, and in Denver in 2019. The predefined key metric of success is the number of attendees who returned to their respective institutions and were actively performing brachytherapy within 6 months of the prostate brachytherapy workshop.  Results:   Of the 111 physician/physicist teams participating in the Chicago, Houston, and Denver prostate brachytherapy workshops, 87 (78%) were actively performing prostate brachytherapy (51 [59%] HDR and 65 [75%] LDR).  Conclusions:   The ABS prostate brachytherapy LDR/HDR simulation workshop has provided a successful education and training structure for medical simulation of the critical procedural steps in quality assurance to shorten the learning curve for delivering consistently high-quality brachytherapy implants for patients with prostate cancer.

Retrospective cohort studies investigating the correlation between statin use and biochemical recurrence free (BCRF) survival in men with CaP have been inconclusive.  Objectives:   In the largest reported surgical cohort to date, we investigated the effect of statin therapy on BCRF and overall survival in patients with CaP who have undergone radical prostatectomy (RP).  Patients and methods:   We performed a retrospective analysis of men (n = 3,088) participating in the NCI funded Specialized Program of Research Excellence (SPORE) in CaP at Northwestern University (NM) in Chicago, Illinois. Patients were treated with RP between 2002 and 2015. Patients in the statin users group received treatment within 2 years prior to or subsequent to RP. Wilcoxon rank-sum and Fisher's exact tests were used to compare age, race, Gleason score, clinical staging, and pathological stage between statin users and nonstatin users.  Results:   The analysis identified 1,222 statin users and 1,865 nonusers (mean age 71 years, 92% Caucasian). After a median follow-up time of 49.0 months, the 5-year BCRF survival rate was 93.3% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 91.9-94.8%) among statin users and 88.6% (95% CI: 87.1%-90%) among nonusers (log-rank P< 0.001).

We previously reported that leukemia cells secrete growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF15)，which remodels the residual bone marrow (BM) adipocytes into small adipocytes and is associated with a poor prognosis in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients. However, little is known about how GDF15 drives BM adipocyte remodeling. In this study, we examined the role of the transient receptor potential vanilloid (TRPV) channels in the remodeling of BM adipocytes exposed to GDF15. We found that TRPV4 negatively regulated GDF15-induced remodeling of BM adipocytes. Furthermore, transforming growth factor-β type II receptor (TGFβRII) was identified as the main receptor for GDF15 on BM adipocytes. PI3K inhibitor treatment reduced GDF15-induced pAKT, identifying PI3K/AKT as the downstream stress response pathway. Subsequently, GDF15 reduced the expression of the transcription factor Forkhead box C1 (FOXC1) in BM adipocytes subjected to RNA-seq screening and Western blot analyse. Moreover, it was also confirmed that FOXC1 combined with the TRPV4 promoter by the Chip-qPCR experiments, which suggests that FOXC1 mediates GDF15 regulation of TRPV4. In addition, an AML mouse model exhibited smaller BM adipocytes, whereas the TRPV4 activator 4α-phorbol 12,13-didecanoate (4αPDD) partly rescued this process and increased survival. In conclusion, TRPV4 plays a critical role in BM adipocyte remodeling induced by leukemia cells, suggesting that targeting TRPV4 may constitute a novel strategy for AML therapy.""","""['Shaoxin Yang', 'Wei Lu', 'Chong Zhao', 'Yuanmei Zhai', 'Yanyu Wei', 'Jiali Liu', 'Yehua Yu', 'Zhiqiang Li', 'Jun Shi']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Haematologica""","""['Growth differentiation factor 15 contributes to marrow adipocyte remodeling in response to the growth of leukemic cells.', 'Consolidation Chemotherapy Prevents Relapse by Indirectly Regulating Bone Marrow Adipogenesis in Patients with Acute Myeloid Leukemia.', 'Mechanosensitive transient receptor potential vanilloid 4 regulates Dermatophagoides farinae-induced airway remodeling via 2 distinct pathways modulating matrix synthesis and degradation.', 'Fatty Acid Metabolism, Bone Marrow Adipocytes, and AML.', 'The bone marrow microenvironment - Home of the leukemic blasts.', 'DEX-Induced SREBF1 Promotes BMSCs Differentiation into Adipocytes to Attract and Protect Residual T-Cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Cells After Chemotherapy.', 'Abnormal bone marrow microenvironment: the ""harbor"" of acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells.', 'Multiple myeloma cells induce lipolysis in adipocytes and uptake fatty acids through fatty acid transporter proteins.', 'Role of TRPV4 Channel in Human White Adipocytes Metabolic Activity.', 'Leukemia stem cell-bone marrow microenvironment interplay in acute myeloid leukemia development.']"""

Optimized multicompartmental models could further improve the detection and characterization of prostate cancer.  Purpose:   To optimize multicompartmental signal models and apply them to study diffusion in normal and cancerous prostate tissue in vivo.  Study type:   Retrospective.  Subjects:   Forty-six patients who underwent MRI examination for suspected prostate cancer; 23 had prostate cancer and 23 had no detectable cancer.  Field strength/sequence:   3T multishell diffusion-weighted sequence.  Assessment:   Multicompartmental models with 2-5 tissue compartments were fit to DWI data from the prostate to determine optimal compartmental apparent diffusion coefficients (ADCs). These ADCs were used to compute signal contributions from the different compartments. The Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) and model-fitting residuals were calculated to quantify model complexity and goodness-of-fit. Tumor contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) and tumor-to-background signal intensity ratio (SIR) were computed for conventional DWI and multicompartmental signal-contribution maps.  Statistical tests:   Analysis of variance (ANOVA) and two-sample t-tests (α = 0.05) were used to compare fitting residuals between prostate regions and between multicompartmental models. T-tests (α = 0.05) were also used to assess differences in compartmental signal-fraction between tissue types and CNR/SIR between conventional DWI and multicompartmental models.  Results:   The lowest BIC was observed from the 4-compartment model, with optimal ADCs of 5.2e-4, 1.9e-3, 3.0e-3, and >3.0e-2 mm2 /sec. Fitting residuals from multicompartmental models were significantly lower than from conventional ADC mapping (P < 0.05). Residuals were lowest in the peripheral zone and highest in tumors. Tumor tissue showed the largest reduction in fitting residual by increasing model order. Tumors had a greater proportion of signal from compartment 1 than normal tissue (P < 0.05). Tumor CNR and SIR were greater on compartment-1 signal maps than conventional DWI (P < 0.05) and increased with model order.  Data conclusion:   The 4-compartment signal model best described diffusion in the prostate. Compartmental signal contributions revealed by this model may improve assessment of prostate cancer.

Laron syndrome (LS) is a type of dwarfism that results from mutation of the GH receptor, leading to congenital IGF1 deficiency. Epidemiological studies have shown that LS patients are protected from cancer. Genome-wide profiling led to the identification of a series of metabolic genes whose differential expression in LS might be linked to cancer protection. Nephronectin (NPNT) is an intracellular and secreted extracellular matrix protein with important roles in kidney development. NPNT was identified as the top-downregulated gene in LS-derived cells in comparison with ethnic-, age- and gender-matched controls (p-value = 0.0148; fold-change = -3.12 versus controls). NPNT has not been previously linked to the IGF1 signaling pathway. The present study was aimed at evaluating the hypothesis that NPNT is a new target for IGF1 action and that decreased expression of NPNT in LS is correlated with cancer protection.  Methods:   Basal and IGF1-stimulated NPNT expression were assessed in LS lymphoblastoid cells as well as in human breast and prostate cancer cells. NPNT silencing experiments were conducted using siRNA methodology.  Results:   We provide evidence that IGF1 stimulates NPNT expression in LS-derived lymphoblastoids and various cancer cell lines. In addition, we demonstrate that NPNT silencing results in diminished activation of the AKT and ERK1/2 pathways, with ensuing decreases in cellular proliferation.  Conclusions:   Our data identified the NPNT gene as a target for IGF1 action.

The anti-proliferative activity of newly synthesized compounds were assessed in vitro against a panel of four human cancer cell lines, namely IMR-32 (neuroblastoma), DU-145 (prostate), MIAPACA (pancreatic), MCF-7 (breast) along with a normal cell line HEK-293T (embryonic kidney) by employing Sulforhodamine B (SRB) assay. The biological results revealed that majority of synthesized compounds exhibited anti-proliferative activity. In particular, compound 12 was found to be the most potent one as it exhibited five fold higher activity (IC50: 7.9 ± 0.07 µM) than parent compound 1 (IC50: 40.63 ± 0.11 µM) against MCF-7 breast cancer cell line. Flow cytometric analysis of compound 12 revealed that it induced apoptosis and arrested cell cycle in G2/M phase. Mechanistic studies have shown the compound as a potent activator of pro-apoptotic proteins, Bax and Cytochrome-c via the upregulation of tumour suppressor proteins, p53 and PTEN.

Main methods:   Exploring pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of the three arginase conjugates with different PEG modality (20 kDa linear as A20L, 20 kDa branched as A20Y, and 40 kDa branched as A40Y) by cell-based and animal studies.  Key findings:   Arginase conjugates showed comparable systemic half-lives, about 20 h in rats and mice. The extended half-life of PEGylated arginase was concurrent with the integrity of conjugates of which PEG and protein moieties remain attached in bloodstream for 72 h after drug administration. Arginase modified with a linear 20 kDa PEG (A20L) was chosen as the lead candidate (PT01). In vitro assays confirmed the very potent cytotoxicity of PT01 against cancer cell lines of breast, prostate, and pancreas origin. In MIA PaCa-2 pancreatic and PC-3 prostate tumor xenograft models, weekly infusion of the PT01 at 5 and 10 mg/kg induced significant tumor growth inhibition of 44-67%.

Materials and methods:   Prostate cancer patients, newly diagnosed from 2017 to 2018 at 7 Dutch teaching hospitals were included. Risk group classification was done twice, using either digital rectal examination (DRE) or mp-MRI information. Risk group migration and rates of treatment intensification associated with mp-MRI upstaging were established. Diagnostic accuracy measures for the detection of nonorgan-confined disease (stage ≥T3a), for both DRE and mp-MRI, were assessed in patients undergoing robot-assisted radical prostatectomy.  Results:   A total of 1683 patients were included. Upstaging due to mp-MRI staging occurred in 493 of 1683 (29%) patients and downstaging in 43 of 1683 (3%) patients. Upstaging was associated with significant higher odds for treatment intensification (odds ratio [OR]: 3.5 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.9-6.5). Stage ≥T3a on mp-MRI was the most common reason for risk group upstaging (77%). Sensitivity for the detection of stage ≥T3a was higher for mp-MRI compared to DRE (51% vs 12%, P <.001), whereas specificity was lower (82% vs 97%, P <.001). Mp-MRI resulted in a significantly higher cumulative rate of true positive and true negative stage ≥T3a predictions compared with DRE (67% vs 58%, P <.001).  Conclusion:   Use of mp-MRI tumor stage for prostate cancer risk classification leads to upstaging in 1 of 3 patients. Mp-MRI enables superior detection of nonorgan-confined disease compared with DRE, and should be the preferred tool for determining clinical tumor stage.""","""['Timo F W Soeterik', 'Harm H E van Melick', 'Lea M Dijksman', 'Douwe H Biesma', 'J Alfred Witjes', 'Jean-Paul A van Basten']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Urology""","""['EDITORIAL COMMENT.', 'Impact of Magnetic Resonance Imaging on Prostate Cancer Staging and European Association of Urology Risk Classification.', 'Multiparametric MRI in detection and staging of prostate cancer.', 'The Key Combined Value of Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging, and Magnetic Resonance Imaging-targeted and Concomitant Systematic Biopsies for the Prediction of Adverse Pathological Features in Prostate Cancer Patients Undergoing Radical Prostatectomy.', 'Multiparametric 11CAcetate positron emission tomography-magnetic resonance imaging in the assessment and staging of prostate cancer.', 'Can the Use of Serial Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging During Active Surveillance of Prostate Cancer Avoid the Need for Prostate Biopsies?-A Systematic Diagnostic Test Accuracy Review.', ""The association of the type and number of D'Amico high-risk criteria with rates of pathologically non-organ-confined prostate cancer."", 'MRI lesion size is more important than the number of positive biopsy cores in predicting adverse features and recurrence after radical prostatectomy: implications for active surveillance criteria in intermediate-risk patients.', 'How To Manage T3b Prostate Cancer in the Contemporary Era: Referee Position.', 'How To Manage T3b Prostate Cancer in the Contemporary Era: The Benefits of Surgery.', 'Impact of prebiopsy MRI on prostate cancer staging: Results from the Norwegian Prostate Cancer Registry.']"""

Both PWR1E and RWPE1 cells were exposed to 10 μM Cd for one year and designated as Cd-PWR1E and Cd-RWPE1. Cd-RWPE1 cells robustly formed tumors in athymic nude mice. Functionally, Cd-exposure induced tumorigenic attributes indicated by increased wound healing, migration and invasion capabilities in both cell lines. RT2-array analysis revealed many oncogenes including P110α, Akt, mTOR, NFKB1 and RAF were induced whereas tumor suppressor (TS) genes were attenuated in Cd-RWPE1. This was validated by individual quantitative-real-time-PCR at transcriptional and by immunoblot at translational levels. These results were consistent in Cd-PWR1E vs parental PWR1E cells. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis revealed that five prostate cancer (PCa) related pathways were enriched in Cd-exposed cells compared to their normal controls. These pathways include the KEGG- Pathways in cancer, Prostate Cancer Pathway, ERBB, Apoptosis and MAPK pathways. We selected up- and down-regulated genes randomly from the PI3K/Akt pathway array and profiled these in the TCGA/GDC prostate-adenocarcinoma (PRAD) patient cohort. An upregulation of oncogenes and downregulation of TS genes was observed in PCa compared to their normal controls. Taken together, our study reveals that the PI3K/Akt signaling is one of the main molecular pathways involved in Cd-driven transformation of normal prostate epithelial cells to malignant form.

Further, concerns were raised about a potentially significant backlog of patients in need of cancer care due to the pandemic-related delays in healthcare, further exacerbating any potential adverse outcomes. Delayed access to surgery is particularly relevant to urologic oncology since one-third of new cancers in men (20% overall) arise from the genitourinary (GU) tract and surgery is often the primary treatment. Herein, we summarize the prepandemic literature on deferred surgery for GU cancers and risk of disease progression. The aforementioned data on delayed surgery were gathered in the context of systemic delays present in certain healthcare systems, or occasionally, due to planned deferral in suboptimal surgical candidates. These data provide indirect, but sufficient insight to develop triage schemas for prioritization of uro-oncological cases. Herein, we outline the extent to which the pandemic-related triage guidelines had influenced urologic practice in various regions. To study the adverse outcomes in the pandemic-era, a survey of urologic oncologists was conducted regarding modifications in their initial management of urologic cancers and any delay-related adverse outcomes. While the adverse effects directly from COVID-19 related delays will become apparent in the coming years, the results showing short-term outcomes are quite instructive. Since cancer care was assigned a higher priority at most centers, this strategy may have avoided significant delays in care and limited the anticipated negative impact of pandemic-related constraints.""","""['Badar M Mian', 'Sana Siddiqui', 'Ardalan E Ahmad']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Urol Oncol""","""['Risks from Deferring Treatment for Genitourinary Cancers: A Collaborative Review to Aid Triage and Management During the COVID-19 Pandemic.', 'Referral pattern for urologic malignancies before and during the COVID-19 pandemic.', ""How uro-oncology has been affected by COVID-19 emergency?

Poisson regression was used to assess trends in incidence for cancer overall and seven common cancers. Associations of cancer with risk of death-censored graft failure (DCGF) and death with functioning graft (DWFG) were evaluated with Cox regression. We also estimated absolute risks of DCGF and graft failure following cancer for recipients transplanted in 2007-2016. There was no significant change in the incidence of cancer overall or for six common cancers in recipients across the 1987-2016 period. Only the incidence of prostate cancer significantly decreased across this period after multivariate adjustment. Among recipients of kidney transplants with non-Hodgkin lymphoma, there were significant declines over time in elevated risks for DCGF and DWFG but no significant changes for other combined cancers. For recipients transplanted in the most recent period (2007-2016), risks following cancer diagnosis remained high, with 38% experiencing DWFG and 14% graft failure within four years of diagnosis. Absolute risk of DWFG was especially high following lung cancer (78%), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (38%), melanoma (35%), and colorectal cancer (49%). Thus, across a 30-year period in the United States, there was no overall change in cancer incidence among recipients of kidney transplants.

With today's two-dimensional (2D) live ultrasound (US) imaging equipment, this task remains complex due to the poor visibility of cancerous tissue on TRUS images and the limited anatomical context available in the 2D TRUS plane. This paper presents a rigid 2D/3DUS registration method for navigated prostate biopsy. This allows continuous localization of the biopsy trajectory during the procedure.  Methods:   We proposed an organ-based approach to achieve real-time rigid registration without the need for any probe localization device. The registration method combines image similarity and geometric proximity of detected features. Additions to our previous work include a multi-level approach and the use of a rejection rate favouring the best matches. Their aim is to increase the accuracy and time performances. These modifications and their in-depth evaluation on real clinical cases and comparison to this previous work are described. We performed static and dynamic evaluations along biopsy trajectories on a very large amount of data acquired under uncontrolled routine conditions. The computed transforms are compared to a ground truth obtained either from corresponding manually detected fiducials or from an already evaluated registration method.  Results:   All results show that the current method outperforms its previous version, both in terms of accuracy (the average error reported here is 12 to 17% smaller depending on the experiment) and processing time (from 20 to 60 times faster compared to the previous implementation). The dynamic registration experiment demonstrates that the method can be successfully used for continuous tracking of the biopsy location w.r.t the prostate at a rate that varies between 5 and 15 Hz.  Conclusions:   This work shows that on the fly 2D/3DUS registration can be performed very efficiently on biopsy trajectories. This allows us to plan further improvements in prostate navigation and a clinical transfer.""","""['Clément Beitone', 'Gaëlle Fiard', 'Jocelyne Troccaz']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['2D-3D rigid registration to compensate for prostate motion during 3D TRUS-guided biopsy.', 'Real-time registration of 3D to 2D ultrasound images for image-guided prostate biopsy.', 'Assessment of image registration accuracy in three-dimensional transrectal ultrasound guided prostate biopsy.', 'Magnetic resonance imaging-transrectal ultrasound fusion image-guided prostate biopsy: Current status of the cancer detection and the prospects of tailor-made medicine of the prostate cancer.', 'TRUS-MRI image registration: a paradigm shift in the diagnosis of significant prostate cancer.']"""

This therapy requires a patient to alternate between periods of androgen suppression treatment and no treatment. Prostate-specific antigen levels are used to track relative changes in tumor volume of prostate cancer patients undergoing intermittent androgen deprivation therapy. During this therapy, there is a pause between treatment cycles. Traditionally, continuous ordinary differential equations are used to estimate prostate-specific antigen levels. In this paper, we use dynamic equations to estimate prostate-specific antigen levels and construct a novel time scale model to account for both continuous and discrete time simultaneously. This allows us to account for breaks between treatment cycles. Using empirical data sets of prostate-specific antigen levels, a known bio-marker of prostate cancer, across multiple patients, we fit our model and use least squares to estimate two parameter values.

In our work, galeterone as a chemical compound under clinical trials for the treatment of prostate cancer, was identified to be effective in targeting breast cancer cells via suppressing MNK-eIF4E and β-catenin. In despite of varying IC50, galeterone at nanomolar concentrations significantly decreased viability, proliferation and migration of a panel of breast cancer cell lines regardless of clinical subtypes and genetic mutations, and to a higher extent than in normal breast cells. Galeterone significantly enhanced the effects of chemotherapeutic drugs in reducing proliferation and viability but not migration. The in vivo efficacy of galeterone as single drug alone and its ability in augmenting chemotherapy's efficacy were also shown in breast cancer xenograft mouse model.

Decreased work participation (going from being employed full time to part time or from employed to not employed) can contribute to financial hardship after cancer but employment outcomes among African American cancer survivors have not been well described. This study estimates the prevalence of work changes and identifies factors associated with decreased work participation among African American cancer survivors. We analyzed data from 916 African American breast, colorectal, lung, and prostate cancer survivors who participated in the Detroit Research on Cancer Survivors (ROCS) cohort and were employed before their cancer diagnosis. Modified Poisson models estimated prevalence ratios of decreased work participation and work changes, including changes to hours, duties, or schedules, between diagnosis and ROCS enrollment controlling for sociodemographic and cancer-related factors. Nearly half of employed survivors made changes to their schedules, duties, or hours worked due to cancer and 34.6% took at least one month off of work, including 18% who took at least one month of unpaid time off. More survivors employed full time (vs. part time) at diagnosis were on disability at ROCS enrollment (18.7% vs. 12.6%, P < 0.001), while fewer were unemployed (5.9% vs. 15.7%, P < 0.001). Nearly half (47.5%) of employed survivors decreased work participation. Taking paid time off was not associated with decreased work participation; however, taking unpaid time off and making work changes were associated with prevalence ratios of decreased work participation of 1.29 (95% CI: 1.03, 1.62) and 1.37 (95% CI: 1.07, 1.75), respectively.

We speculated that microRNAs (miRNAs) that are inhibited by TGF-β1 might exert anti-tumor effects. To assess this, we identified several miRNAs downregulated by TGF-β1 in PCa cell lines and selected miR-3691-3p for detailed analysis as a candidate anti-oncogene miRNA. miR-3691-3p was expressed at significantly lower levels in human PCa tissue compared with paired benign prostatic hyperplasia tissue, and its expression level correlated inversely with aggressive clinical pathological features. Overexpression of miR-3691-3p in PCa cell lines inhibited proliferation, migration, and invasion, and promoted apoptosis. The miR-3691-3p target genes E2F transcription factor 3 (E2F3) and PR domain containing 1, with ZNF domain (PRDM1) were upregulated in miR-3691-3p-overexpressing PCa cells, and silencing of E2F3 or PRDM1 suppressed PCa cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. Treatment of mice bearing PCa xenografts with a miR-3691-3p agomir inhibited tumor growth and promoted tumor cell apoptosis. Consistent with the negative regulation of E2F3 and PRDM1 by miR-3691-3p, both proteins were overexpressed in clinical PCa specimens compared with noncancerous prostate tissue. Our results indicate that TGF-β1-regulated miR-3691-3p acts as an anti-oncogene in PCa by downregulating E2F3 and PRDM1.

However, diagnostic accuracy is largely lacking for radiolabeled PSMA PET/CT in patients with biochemical persistence (BCP; that is, persistently measurable prostate-specific antigen [PSA] values after robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy [RARP]). Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine the role of PSMA (i.e.,18F-DCFPyL or 68Ga-PSMA-11) PET/CT imaging in patients who experience BCP after RARP and to evaluate the sites of persistent disease on PSMA PET/CT. Methods: In total, 150 consecutive patients with BCP after RARP who underwent radiolabeled PSMA PET/CT imaging were retrospectively evaluated. BCP was defined as any detectable first serum PSA value after RARP (≥0.1 ng/mL) at least 6 wk after surgery, in the absence of an undetectable PSA value after RARP. A multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to identify predictors for the detection of metastases outside the prostatic fossa (≥miN1) on PSMA PET/CT. Results: PSMA PET/CT was performed at a median PSA value of 0.60 ng/mL (interquartile range, 0.3-2.4) after a median of 6 mo (interquartile range, 4-10) after RARP. In total, 101 of 150 patients (67%) had lesions with PSMA expression on PET/CT, and 89 of 150 (59%) had lesions with increased PSMA expression sites outside the prostatic fossa. Moreover, 39 of 150 patients (26%) had PSMA-positive lesions outside the pelvis. On multivariable analysis, higher PSA values after RARP (P = 0.004) and positive pathologic lymph node status (P = 0.006) were independent predictors for ≥miN1. Conclusion: In the presence of BCP, a high proportion of patients already had disease metastatic to the pelvic lymph nodes or showed evidence of distant metastases, as indicated by PSMA PET/CT. Higher PSA levels after RARP and positive pathologic lymph node status were significantly associated with metastases outside the prostatic fossa.

Methods and materials:   A database was analyzed, which contained information and long-term followup on 903 men who had an iodine-125 seed implant as monotherapy for early-stage prostate cancer.

In 30 men developing BF more recently who had a PSMA PET-CT scan, the relapse site was demonstrated in all cases, and 19 (63%) men had relapsed at the prostate base. Radiation dosimetry of base relapses and paired controls demonstrated that implants routinely delivered a lower radiation dose to the base than to the rest of the prostate.

A shared haplotype flanking the variant in all carriers was identified, strongly suggesting a common founder of European origin. Additionally, using two independent statistical algorithms, implemented by DMLE+2.3 and ESTIAGE, we were able to estimate the age of the variant between 2300 and 3125 years. By extending the haplotype analysis to 14 additional carrier families, a shared core haplotype was revealed among all carriers matching the conserved region previously identified in the high-density SNP analysis. These findings are consistent with CHEK2 c.349A>G being a founder variant associated with increased PrCa risk, suggesting its potential usefulness for cost-effective targeted genetic screening in PrCa families.""","""['Andreia Brandão', 'Paula Paulo', 'Sofia Maia', 'Manuela Pinheiro', 'Ana Peixoto', 'Marta Cardoso', 'Maria P Silva', 'Catarina Santos', 'Rosalind A Eeles', 'Zsofia Kote-Jarai', 'Kenneth Muir', 'Ukgpcs Collaborators', 'Johanna Schleutker', 'Ying Wang', 'Nora Pashayan', 'Jyotsna Batra', 'Apcb BioResource', 'Henrik Grönberg', 'David E Neal', 'Børge G Nordestgaard', 'Catherine M Tangen', 'Melissa C Southey', 'Alicja Wolk', 'Demetrius Albanes', 'Christopher A Haiman', 'Ruth C Travis', 'Janet L Stanford', 'Lorelei A Mucci', 'Catharine M L West', 'Sune F Nielsen', 'Adam S Kibel', 'Olivier Cussenot', 'Sonja I Berndt', 'Stella Koutros', 'Karina Dalsgaard Sørensen', 'Cezary Cybulski', 'Eli Marie Grindedal', 'Jong Y Park', 'Sue A Ingles', 'Christiane Maier', 'Robert J Hamilton', 'Barry S Rosenstein', 'Ana Vega', 'The Impact Study Steering Committee And Collaborators', 'Manolis Kogevinas', 'Fredrik Wiklund', 'Kathryn L Penney', 'Hermann Brenner', 'Esther M John', 'Radka Kaneva', 'Christopher J Logothetis', 'Susan L Neuhausen', 'Kim De Ruyck', 'Azad Razack', 'Lisa F Newcomb', 'Canary Pass Investigators', 'Davor Lessel', 'Nawaid Usmani', 'Frank Claessens', 'Manuela Gago-Dominguez', 'Paul A Townsend', 'Monique J Roobol', 'The Profile Study Steering Committee', 'The Practical Consortium', 'Manuel R Teixeira']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Cancers (Basel)""","""['Comprehensive Clinical and Genetic Analysis of CHEK2 in Croatian Men with Prostate Cancer.', 'A pathogenic variant in CHEK2 shows a founder effect in Portuguese Roma patients with thyroid cancer.', 'The role of germline mutations in the BRCA1/2 and mismatch repair genes in men ascertained for early-onset and/or familial prostate cancer.', 'Hereditary Predisposition to Prostate Cancer: From Genetics to Clinical Implications.', 'CHEK2 (∗) 1100delC Mutation and Risk of Prostate Cancer.', 'Exome sequencing of affected duos and trios uncovers PRUNE2 as a novel prostate cancer predisposition gene.', 'Comprehensive Clinical and Genetic Analysis of CHEK2 in Croatian Men with Prostate Cancer.', 'Hereditary Breast Cancer in the Brazilian State of Ceará (The CHANCE Cohort): Higher-Than-Expected Prevalence of Recurrent Germline Pathogenic Variants.', 'Novel Germline Mutations in a Cohort of Men with Familial Prostate Cancer.', 'Germline Pathogenic Variant Prevalence Among Latin American and US Hispanic Individuals Undergoing Testing for Hereditary Breast and Ovarian Cancer: A Cross-Sectional Study.']"""

Materials and methods:   We retrospectively reviewed data of men enrolled on active surveillance at our institution between 1990 and 2018 with low or intermediate risk disease (stage cT1-2, prostate specific antigen less than 20 ng/ml, and biopsy Grade Group [GG]1-2). Patients were classified into 3 groups by diagnostic GG and prostate specific antigen density. Primary outcome was metastatic prostate cancer detected on imaging or at prostatectomy. In addition, upgrade at surveillance biopsy, active treatment, and overall and prostate cancer specific survival outcomes were assessed. Cox proportional hazards regression models were used.  Results:   A total of 1,450 men met the inclusion criteria. Median followup was 77 months (IQR 49-114). The 7-year metastasis-free survival rate was 99%. Metastases developed in 15 men at a median of 62 months (IQR 29-104), of which 69% were confined to lymph nodes. Men with GG2 had a lower metastasis-free survival rate compared to those with GG1 disease. GG2, prostate specific antigen velocity and PI-RADS® 4-5 lesions on multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging were associated with a higher risk of metastases. The 7-year prostate cancer specific survival was greater than 99%.  Conclusions:   Active surveillance seems to preserve favorable long-term prognosis, as metastases and prostate cancer specific death are rare. However, the higher risk of metastases associated with higher Gleason grade, prostate specific antigen velocity, and characteristics on multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging should be considered when selecting and counseling patients for active surveillance.""","""['Martina Maggi', 'Janet E Cowan', 'Vittorio Fasulo', 'Samuel L Washington rd', 'Peter E Lonergan', 'Alessandro Sciarra', 'Hao G Nguyen', 'Peter R Carroll']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""J Urol""","""['The Long-Term Risks of Metastases in Men on Active Surveillance for Early Stage Prostate Cancer.

Methods:   Eighty-five patients with intermediate-risk prostate cancer who received CIRT and neoadjuvant ADT from December 2015 to December 2017 were analyzed in the present study. The total dose of CIRT was set at 51.6 Gy (relative biological effectiveness) delivered in 12 fractions over 3 weeks. The PSA bounce was defined as a ≥0.4 ng/ml increase of PSA levels from the nadir, followed by any decrease. PSA failure was defined using the Phoenix criteria.  Results:   The median patient age was 68 (range, 48-81) years. The median follow-up duration was 33 (range, 20-48) months. The clinical T stage was T1c, T2a, and T2b in 27, 44, and 14 patients, respectively. The Gleason score was 6 in 3 patients and 7 in 82 patients. The median pretreatment PSA level was 7.37 (range, 3.33-19.0) ng/ml. All patients received neoadjuvant ADT for a median of 6 (range, 2-117) months. PSA bounces were observed in 39 patients (45.9%), occurring a median of 12 (range, 6-30) months after CIRT. PSA failure was observed in eight patients (9.4%), occurring a median of 21 (range, 15-33) months after CIRT. The 3-year PSA failure-free survival rate was 88.5%. No clinical recurrence was observed during the follow-up period. Younger age and lower T stage were significant predictors of PSA bounce. Younger age was a significant predictor of PSA failure.  Conclusions:   In this study, we identified the significant predictors of the occurrence of PSA bounce and failure. Further follow-up is needed to reveal the clinical significance of PSA dynamics.""","""['Yosuke Takakusagi', 'Takahiro Oike', 'Kio Kano', 'Wataru Anno', 'Keisuke Tsuchida', 'Nobutaka Mizoguchi', 'Itsuko Serizawa', 'Daisaku Yoshida', 'Hiroyuki Katoh', 'Tadashi Kamada']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['PSA response to neoadjuvant androgen deprivation therapy is a strong independent predictor of survival in high-risk prostate cancer in the dose-escalated radiation therapy era.', 'Significant impact of biochemical recurrence on overall mortality in patients with high-risk prostate cancer after carbon-ion radiotherapy combined with androgen deprivation therapy.', 'Report of a multicenter Canadian phase III randomized trial of 3 months vs. 8 months neoadjuvant androgen deprivation before standard-dose radiotherapy for clinically localized prostate cancer.', 'Prognostic value of biochemical response to neoadjuvant androgen deprivation before external beam radiotherapy for prostate cancer: A systematic review of the literature.', 'Management of prostate cancer radiotherapy during the COVID-19 pandemic: A necessary paradigm change.']"""

Current invasive and noninvasive diagnostic methods for N-staging like lymph node dissection, morphologic computed tomography/magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or positron emission tomography-computed tomography have significant limitations because of technical, biological, or anatomical reasons. Therefore, there is a great clinical need for more precise, reliable, and noninvasive N-staging in patients with solid tumors. Using ultrasmall superparamagnetic particles of ironoxide (USPIO)-enhanced MRI offers noninvasive diagnostic possibilities for N-staging of different types of cancer, including the 4 examples given in this work (head and neck cancer, esophageal cancer, rectal cancer, and prostate cancer). The excellent soft tissue contrast of MRI and an USPIO-based differentiation of metastatic versus nonmetastatic lymph nodes can enable more precise therapy and, therefore, fewer side effects, essentially in cancer patients in oligometastatic disease stage. By discussing 3 important questions in this article, we explain why lymph node staging is so important, why the timing for more accurate N-staging is right, and how it can be done with MRI. We illustrate this with the newest developments in magnetic resonance methodology enabling the use of USPIO-enhanced MRI at ultrahigh magnetic field strength and in moving parts of the body like upper abdomen or mediastinum. For prostate cancer, a comparison with radionuclide tracers connected to prostate specific membrane antigen is made. Under consideration also is the use of MRI for improvement of ex vivo cancer diagnostics. Further scientific and clinical development is needed to assess the accuracy of USPIO-enhanced MRI of detecting small metastatic deposits for different cancer types in different anatomical locations and to broaden the indications for the use of (USPIO-enhanced) MRI in lymph node imaging in clinical practice.""","""['Tom W J Scheenen', 'Patrik Zamecnik']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Invest Radiol""","""['High-Accuracy Nodal Staging of Head and Neck Cancer With USPIO-Enhanced MRI: A New Reading Algorithm Based on Node-to-Node Matched Histopathology.', 'Assessment of lymph node status in rectal cancer by imaging.', 'Positron emission tomography (PET) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for the assessment of axillary lymph node metastases in early breast cancer: systematic review and economic evaluation.', 'Combined ultrasmall superparamagnetic particles of iron oxide-enhanced and diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging reliably detect pelvic lymph node metastases in normal-sized nodes of bladder and prostate cancer patients.', 'The role of ultrasound in primary workup of cervical cancer staging (ESGO, ESTRO, ESP cervical cancer guidelines).', 'Lymph nodes primary staging of colorectal cancer in 18F-FDG PET/MRI: a systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'A vision of 14\xa0T MR for fundamental and clinical science.', 'Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) regional nodal disease at standard lymphadenectomy: is MRI accurate for identifying node-positive patients?', 'Emerging trends in the nanomedicine applications of functionalized magnetic nanoparticles as novel therapies for acute and chronic diseases.', 'High-Accuracy Nodal Staging of Head and Neck Cancer With USPIO-Enhanced MRI: A New Reading Algorithm Based on Node-to-Node Matched Histopathology.']"""

Although the Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA) test is widely used in PCa screenings, it has significant limitations in the differential diagnosis of PCa. Therefore, studies on developing new biomarkers for PCa diagnosis are ongoing. MiRNAs are good candidate biomarkers for the diagnosis of cancers, including prostate cancer, as they can be easily detected from circulation.  Objective:   In this study, it is aimed to determine the diagnostic value of serum levels of miR-223-3p and -223-5p in Benign Prostate Hyperplasia (BPH), Chronic Prostatitis (CP) and Prostate Cancer (PCa).  Methods:   Serum samples were collected from 68 patients in total (25 BPH, 10 CP, 33 PCa). MiR-223- 3p and -223-5p levels were measured in serum with qRT-PCR. The Ct values of miRNAs were normalized according to the Ct value of ce-miR-39 and calculated -ΔCt values were used for statistical analyses.  Results:   The serum levels of miR-223-3p and -223-5p were downregulated in the PCa and CP groups, compared to the BPH group. There was no statistically significant difference between PCa and CP groups. The sensitivity and specificity of miR-223-3p, -223-5p and their combination were calculated as 88% and 88%; 86% and 79%; 93% and 92% in discriminating BPH and PCa groups, respectively.  Conclusion:   In this study, it was shown that miR-223-3p and -223-5p were both detectable in circulation. miR-223-3p, -223-5p, and their combination may be good candidate biomarkers for prostate cancer diagnosis. Also, observation of similar serum levels of miR-223-3p and -223-5p between CP and PCa groups suggests that miR-223 may play a role in prostate cancer development originated from chronic inflammation.""","""['Yakup Dülgeroğlu', 'Onur Eroğlu']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Microrna""","""['Diagnostic and prognostic value of serum miR-15a and miR-16-1 expression among egyptian patients with prostate cancer.', 'Differential blood-based diagnosis between benign prostatic hyperplasia and prostate cancer: miRNA as source for biomarkers independent of PSA level, Gleason score, or TNM status.', 'MiR-139-5p is Increased in the Peripheral Blood of Patients with Prostate Cancer.', 'Prostate tissue and serum markers.', 'Assessment of miR-98-5p, miR-152-3p, miR-326 and miR-4289 Expression as Biomarker for Prostate Cancer Diagnosis.', 'miR-223-3p Regulates NLRP3 to Inhibit Proliferation and Promote Apoptosis of ONG Cells.']"""

Tip60 is commonly found in the nucleus, where it acetylates proteins involved in transcription, DNA repair, and chromatin; however, it has also been shown to acetylate cytoplasmic targets. In this study, we investigated the relationship between Tip60 localization and breast and lung cancer. In cell fractionation experiments, cancer-derived cell lines showed a shift from nuclear to cytoplasmic endogenous Tip60 compared with cell lines derived from normal cells. With immunofluorescence, we observed four different localization patterns of overexpressed Tip60 and found that cancer cells had increased cytoplasmic localization of Tip60 compared with HEK-293 cells. The addition of a nuclear localization signal (NLS) increased the number of cells containing nuclear Tip60, whereas mutation of a putative endogenous NLS increased the number of cells with cytoplasmic Tip60. Overexpression of Tip60 increased cancer cell line sensitivity to paclitaxel regardless of changes in localization. These results suggest that dysregulation of Tip60 in breast and lung cancer is not limited to reduced expression but may also involve subcellular localization.""","""['Priyadarshini Ravichandran', 'Simon A Davis', 'Himali Vashishtha', 'Azad L Gucwa', 'Daniel S Ginsburg']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""DNA Cell Biol""","""['The acetyltransferase Tip60 contributes to mammary tumorigenesis by modulating DNA repair.', 'TIP60/P400/H4K12ac Plays a Role as a Heterochromatin Back-up Skeleton in Breast Cancer.', 'Acetylation of TIP60 at K104 is essential for metabolic stress-induced apoptosis in cells of hepatocellular cancer.', 'Tip60: updates.', 'Modulation of Nuclear Receptor Function by Chromatin Modifying Factor TIP60.', 'Post-Translational Modifications by Lipid Metabolites during the DNA Damage Response and Their Role in Cancer.']"""

Here, we report that the mRNA and protein expression levels of BAP1 are downregulated in clinical PCa specimens. BAP1 can physically bind to and deubiquitinate PTEN, which inhibits the ubiquitination-mediated degradation of PTEN and thus stabilizes PTEN protein. Ectopically expressed BAP1 in PCa cells increases PTEN protein level and subsequently inhibits the AKT signaling pathway, thus suppressing PCa progression. Conversely, knockdown of BAP1 in PCa cells leads to the decrease in PTEN protein level and the activation of the Akt signaling pathway, therefore promoting malignant transformation and cancer metastasis. However, these can be reversed by the re-expression of PTEN. More importantly, we found that BAP1 protein level positively correlates with PTEN in a substantial fraction of human cancers. These findings demonstrate that BAP1 is an important deubiquitinase of PTEN for its stability and the BAP1-PTEN signaling axis plays a crucial role in tumor suppression.""","""['Rong Deng', 'Yanmin Guo', 'Lian Li', 'Jianfeng He', 'Zhe Qiang', 'Hailong Zhang', 'Ran Chen', 'Yanli Wang', 'Xian Zhao', 'Jianxiu Yu']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Mol Oncol""","""['The equilibrium of tumor suppression: DUBs as active regulators of PTEN.', 'Deubiquitylation and stabilization of PTEN by USP13.', 'PLZF mediates the PTEN/AKT/FOXO3a signaling in suppression of prostate tumorigenesis.', 'IMP3 accelerates the progression of prostate cancer through inhibiting PTEN expression in a SMURF1-dependent way.', 'Roles and mechanisms of BAP1 deubiquitinase in tumor suppression.', 'Ubiquitin specific peptidases and prostate cancer.', 'The equilibrium of tumor suppression: DUBs as active regulators of PTEN.', 'Deubiquitinase USP35 stabilizes BRPF1 to activate mevalonate (MVA) metabolism during prostate tumorigenesis.', 'BAP1 in cancer: epigenetic stability and genome integrity.', 'Linear ubiquitination of PTEN impairs its function to promote prostate cancer progression.']"""

Methods:   Newly diagnosed PCa patients with available residency status were abstracted from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database (2004-2016). Propensity-score (PS) matching, cumulative incidence plots, multivariate competing-risks regression (CRR) models were used.  Results:   Of 531,468 PCa patients of all stages, 6653 (1.3%) resided in RA, 50,932 (9.6%) in UC and 473,883 (89.2%) in UA. No statistically significant or clinically meaningful differences in stage at presentation or CSM were recorded. Conversely, 10-year other cause-mortality (OCM) rates were 27.2% vs 23.7% vs 18.9% (p < 0.001) in RA vs UC vs UA patients, respectively. In CRR models, RA (subhazard ratio [SHR] 1.38; p < 0.001) and UC (SHR 1.18; p < 0.001) were independent predictors for higher OCM relative to UA. These differences remained statistically significant in fully PS-adjusted multivariate CRR models.

Materials and methods:   A total of 134 PCa patients were randomly included from patients who underwent surgical resection at our hospital from October 2015 to December 2016. The SNHG1 expression levels in PCa tissues and paired adjacent non-cancerous tissues were detected by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). The association of the SNHG1 expression with clinical-pathological features of PCa patients was summarized and evaluated. A short interfering (si) RNA targeting SNHG1 and pcDNA3.1-SNHG1 were transfected into PC3 and DU145 PCa cell lines, and transfection efficiency was verified by qRT-PCR. Cell proliferation and apoptosis were assessed by methylthiazolyldiphenyl-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assays, respectively.  Results:   The SNHG1 expression was significantly upregulated in PCa tumor tissues compared with paired adjacent non-cancerous tissues. The SNHG1 expression was obviously associated with the TNM stage, Gleason Score, lymph node invasion, and long-term metastasis mortality rate. Silencing of SNHG1 inhibited cell proliferation and promoted apoptosis in PC3 and DU145 PCa cell lines in vitro, while overexpression of SNHG1 led to opposite results.

It is the confirmatory diagnosis of the most common malignancy in elderly men. Currently, there is no national guideline on PB in Nigeria; hence, practices vary among urologists and institutions. The sudy aim was to highlight the various PB practices among Nigerian urologists with a view to determining the gap between our practice and evidenced-based global practice.  Materials and methods:   A descriptive cross-sectional study which utilised self-administered questionnaires distributed among urologists who participated at the Nigerian Association of Urological Surgeons' (NAUS) Conference in Lagos in 2014.  Results:   The total number of respondents was 102, distributed across 26 states and various levels of the hospital. All respondents stated that they always perform biopsy if prostate-specific antigen (PSA) was >10 ng/ml. Seventy-nine (77.5%) respondents routinely rely on PSA kinetics in taking a decision on PB. About four-fifth routinely discontinue aspirin before the biopsy. All respondents administer antibiotics with a preference for the parenteral route in 74.5%. Anaesthesia employed for PB included, regional by 52 respondents (50.9%), local by 39 respondents (38.2%), and general by 1 respondent (1.0%), respectively. Transrectal route was preferred by 96 (94.1%). Majority (74.6%) still practice digitally-guided biopsy, whereas 25.4% perform the transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsy. The number of cores commonly taken for systematic technique ranges from 6 to 18. About a quarter (25.5%) had personal or institutional publication (s) on PB.

Herein, we compared pathology results and cancer detection rates of FB with our standard 14-core systematic prostate biopsy (SB) that includes 2 anterior cores.  Materials and methods:   One hundred two men with elevated prostate-specific antigen and suspicious lesions on multiparametric MRI, Prostate Imaging Reporting And Data System (PI-RADS) v2 score ≥ 3, underwent FB. Each target lesion was biopsied 3 times; our SB was performed concurrently. Biopsy results were compared for overall and clinically significant (cs), defined as Gleason score ≥ 7, cancer detection.  Results:   Fifty-two percent of patients had positive biopsy results, and of those, 44 had cs prostate cancer (PCa). The overall detection rates for FB and SB were 39% and 50%, respectively, and there was no statistical difference in the detection rate of csPCa detection rate (P = .42). Of 17 patients diagnosed with a high-risk PCa, defined as Gleason score ≥ 8, SB identified 15, whereas FB identified 10. Within the SB group, 21 had positive anterior core biopsies, of which 11 were cs.  Conclusion:   Expanding the standard template prostate biopsies to include 2 anterior horn sampling may be just as effective as FB in men with PI-RADS lesion ≥ 3, thereby mitigating the increased cost associated with FB.""","""['Joshua Sterling', 'Kelsea Smith', 'Nicholas Farber', 'Naoya Nagaya', 'Thomas L Jang', 'Eric A Singer', 'Evita Sadimin', 'Isaac Yi Kim']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Clin Genitourin Cancer""","""['Combination of Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging With Elastic-fusion Biopsy Has a High Sensitivity in Detecting Clinically Significant Prostate Cancer in Daily Practice.', 'Not All Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging-targeted Biopsies Are Equal: The Impact of the Type of Approach and Operator Expertise on the Detection of Clinically Significant Prostate Cancer.', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)-Targeted Biopsy in Patients with Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA) Levels <20 ng/mL: A Single-Center Study in Northeastern China.', 'Multiparametric MRI in detection and staging of prostate cancer.', 'Role of multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging fusion biopsy in active surveillance of prostate cancer: a systematic review.', 'Clinically significant prostate cancer (csPCa) detection with various prostate sampling schemes based on different csPCa definitions.']"""

Since it was indicated that graphene oxide (GO) might facilitate passive diffusion of lipophilic compounds probably via Trojan horse-like mechanism, we tested the hypothesis if this suggestion would apply for androgens as well. Thus, we investigated if GO affects dihydrotestosterone (DHT)-triggered signalling of AR in two prostate cancer-derived cell lines, 22Rv1 and LNCaP. These cell lines differ in number of AR variants, i.e. there are two variants in 22Rv1 cells (full length and truncated) but only one in LNCaP cells (full length). Graphene oxide had no effect on basal luciferase activity but significantly decreased DHT-inducible AR-dependent luciferase activity in stably transfected cells. In 22Rv1 cells, it induced concentration-dependent decrease of DHT-inducible KLK3 mRNA and PSA protein after 24 h. While there was no effect on UBE2C mRNA (regulated by truncated variant), there was synergistic effect of DHT and GO on UBE2C protein level. Translocation of full-length AR (AR-FL) was potentiated by GO in the presence of DHT in 22Rv1 cells but it was suppressed in LNCaP cells. DHT-stimulated enrichment of AR-FL on KLK3 promoter was not significantly affected by GO in any tested cell line neither was KLK3 mRNA at 4 h of incubation. In conclusion, GO affects DHT-triggered signalling in both types of cells in similar manner, but ligand-triggered redistribution of AR-FL is affected differently.

Taxane-platinum combinations have shown clinical benefit in a subset of patients, but the mechanistic basis and biomarkers remain elusive.  Objective:   To identify mechanisms and response indicators for the antitumor efficacy of taxane-platinum combinations in mCRPC.  Design, setting, and participants:   Transcriptomic data from a publicly available mCRPC dataset of taxane-exposed and taxane-naïve patients were analyzed to identify response indicators and emerging vulnerabilities. Functional and preclinical validation was performed in taxane-resistant mCRPC cell lines and genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs).  Intervention:   Metastatic CRPC cells were treated with docetaxel, cisplatin, carboplatin, the CXCR2 antagonist SB265610, and the BCL-2 inhibitor venetoclax. Gain and loss of function in culture of CXCR2 and BCL-2 were achieved by overexpression or siRNA silencing. Preclinical assays in GEMM mice tested the antitumor efficacy of taxane-platinum combinations.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Proliferation, apoptosis, and colony assays measured drug activity in vitro. Preclinical endpoints in mice included growth, survival, and histopathology. Changes in CXCR2, BCL-2, and chemokines were analyzed by reverse transcriptase quantitative polymerase chain reaction and Western blot. Human expression data were analyzed using Gene Set Enrichment Analysis, hierarchical clustering, and correlation studies. GraphPad Prism software and R-studio were used for statistical and data analyses.  Results and limitations:   Transcriptomic data from taxane-exposed human mCRPC tumors correlate with a marked negative enrichment of apoptosis and inflammatory response pathways accompanied by a marked downregulation of CXCR2 and BCL-2. Mechanistically, we show that docetaxel inhibits CXCR2 and that BCL-2 downregulation occurs as a downstream effect. Further, we demonstrated in experimental models that the sensitivity to cisplatin is dependent on CXCR2 and BCL-2, and that targeting them sensitizes prostate cancer (PC) cells to cisplatin. In vivo taxane-platinum combinations are highly synergistic, and previous exposure to taxanes sensitizes mCRPC tumors to second-line cisplatin treatment.  Conclusions:   The hitherto unappreciated attenuation of the CXCR2/BCL-2 axis in taxane-treated mCRPC patients is an acquired vulnerability with potential predictive activity for platinum-based treatments.  Patient summary:   A subset of patients with aggressive and therapy-resistant prostate cancer benefits from taxane-platinum combination chemotherapy; however, we lack the mechanistic understanding of how that synergistic effect occurs. Here, using patient data and preclinical models, we found that taxanes reduce cancer cell escape mechanisms to chemotherapy-induced cell death, hence making these cells more vulnerable to additional platinum treatment.""","""['Vicenç Ruiz de Porras', 'Xieng C Wang', 'Luis Palomero', 'Mercedes Marin-Aguilera', 'Carme Solé-Blanch', 'Alberto Indacochea', 'Natalia Jimenez', 'Sara Bystrup', 'Martin Bakht', 'Vincenza Conteduca', 'Josep M Piulats', 'Oscar Buisan', 'José F Suarez', 'Juan Carlos Pardo', 'Elena Castro', 'David Olmos', 'Himisha Beltran', 'Begoña Mellado', 'Eva Martinez-Balibrea', 'Albert Font', 'Alvaro Aytes']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Eur Urol""","""['Treatment-induced Treatment Sensitization in Metastatic Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Re: Vicenç Ruiz de Porras, Xieng C.

Most compounds displayed moderate to high anticancer activities against five tested tumor cells (PC3, EC109, DU-145, MGC803, MCF-7). Specifically, the represented compound 16f possessed strong antiproliferative potency and high selectivity toward PC3 cells with the IC50 value of 0.054 μM, compared with normal WPMY-1 cells with the IC50 value of 19.470 μM. Preliminary mechanism research indicated that compound 16f could significantly suppress prostate cancer cells (PC3, DU-145) growth and colony formation in a dose-dependent manner.

It has been previously reported that rosemary extract (RE) has antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer properties. In the present study, we found that treatment of the androgen-insensitive PC-3 prostate cancer cells with RE resulted in a significant inhibition of proliferation, survival, migration, Akt, and mTOR signaling.

This study aimed to address this void.  Methods:   Within the SEER database (2010-2015), we focused on patients with very low, low, and favorable intermediate risk for prostate cancer who underwent radical prostatectomy and had available stage and grade information. Descriptive analyses, temporal trend analyses, and multivariate logistic regression analyses were used.  Results:   Overall, 4,704 patients with very low risk (701 Black vs 4,003 White), 17,785 with low risk (2,696 Black vs 15,089 White), and 11,040 with favorable intermediate risk (1,693 Black vs 9,347 White) were identified. Rates of upgrading and/or upstaging in Black versus White patients were respectively 42.1% versus 37.7% (absolute Δ = +4.4%; P<.001) in those with very low risk, 48.6% versus 46.0% (absolute Δ = +2.6%; P<.001) in those with low risk, and 33.8% versus 35.3% (absolute Δ = -1.5%; P=.05) in those with favorable intermediate risk.  Conclusions:   Rates of misclassification were particularly elevated in patients with very low risk and low risk, regardless of race, and ranged from 33.8% to 48.6%. Recalibration of very-low-, low-, and, to a lesser extent, favorable intermediate-risk active surveillance criteria may be required.

Methods:   A retrospective cohort of 28,039 newly diagnosed PCa patients aged ≥35 years was constructed using the Taiwan Cancer Registry in 2008-2016. Patients were categorized by age at diagnosis (≤54, 55-59, 60-69, 70-74, and ≥75 years). The clinical stage at diagnosis, Gleason score, prostate-specific antigen level at diagnosis, Charlson's comorbidity index, and primary and secondary treatments for PCa were included in the analysis. All-cause mortality and prostate cancer-specific mortality (PCSM) were reported. Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) estimating the risks of death and of receiving secondary cancer treatment were generated by Cox hazard models.  Results:   In patients aged ≤54, 55-59, and 60-69 years, about 60% of them in each group were classified into the high-risk, very high-risk, or metastatic group.

Methods:   Planning CT and structure datasets for 120 patients with intact prostate cancer were retrospectively selected and divided for tenfold cross-validation. The proposed adversarial multi-residual multi-scale pooling Markov random field (MRF) enhanced network (ARPM-net) implements an adversarial training scheme. A segmentation network and a discriminator network were trained jointly, and only the segmentation network was used for prediction. The segmentation network integrates a newly designed MRF block into a variation of multi-residual U-net. The discriminator takes the product of the original CT and the prediction/ground-truth as input and classifies the input into fake/real. The segmentation network and discriminator network can be trained jointly as a whole, or the discriminator can be used for fine-tuning after the segmentation network is coarsely trained. Multi-scale pooling layers were introduced to preserve spatial resolution during pooling using less memory compared to atrous convolution layers. An adaptive loss function was proposed to enhance the training on small or low contrast organs. The accuracy of modeled contours was measured with the dice similarity coefficient (DSC), average Hausdorff distance (AHD), average surface Hausdorff distance (ASHD), and relative volume difference (VD) using clinical contours as references to the ground-truth. The proposed ARPM-net method was compared to several state-of-the-art deep learning methods.  Results:   ARPM-net outperformed several existing deep learning approaches and MRF methods and achieved state-of-the-art performance on a testing dataset. On the test set with 20 cases, the average DSC on the prostate, bladder, rectum, left femur, and right femur were 0.88 ( ± 0.11), 0.97 ( ± 0.07), 0.86 ( ± 0.12), 0.97 ( ± 0.01), and 0.97 ( ± 0.01), respectively. The average HD (mm) on these organs were 1.58 ( ± 1.77), 1.91 ( ± 1.29), 3.14 ( ± 2.39), 1.76 ( ± 1.57), and 1.92 ( ± 1.01). The average surface HD (mm) on these organs are 2.11 ( ± 2.03), 2.36 ( ± 2.43), 3.05 ( ± 2.11), 1.99 ( ± 1.66), and 2.00 ( ± 2.07).  Conclusion:   ARPM-net was designed for the automatic segmentation of pelvic CT images. With adversarial fine-tuning, ARPM-net produces state-of-the-art accurate contouring of multiple organs on CT images and has the potential to facilitate routine pelvic cancer radiation therapy planning process.""","""['Zhuangzhuang Zhang', 'Tianyu Zhao', 'Hiram Gay', 'Weixiong Zhang', 'Baozhou Sun']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Male pelvic multi-organ segmentation using token-based transformer Vnet.', 'Synthetic MRI-aided multi-organ segmentation on male pelvic CT using cycle consistent deep attention network.', 'Abdomen CT multi-organ segmentation using token-based MLP-Mixer.', 'A deep learning-based approach to automatic proximal femur segmentation in quantitative CT images.', 'Automated vessel segmentation in lung CT and CTA images via deep neural networks.', 'Impact of Training Data, Ground Truth and Shape Variability in the Deep Learning-Based Semantic Segmentation of HeLa Cells Observed with Electron Microscopy.', 'Deep learning multi-organ segmentation for whole mouse cryo-images including a comparison of 2D and 3D deep networks.', 'Back Propagation Neural Network-Based Magnetic Resonance Imaging Image Features in Treating Intestinal Obstruction in Digestive Tract Diseases with Chengqi Decoction.', 'Technical note: The effect of image annotation with minimal manual interaction for semiautomatic prostate segmentation in CT images using fully convolutional neural networks.', 'Development of in-house fully residual deep convolutional neural network-based segmentation software for the male pelvic CT.']"""

Such a system could enable the expansion of radiation therapy to meet global demand and reduce capital costs. Recent advances in adaptive radiation therapy could potentially be applied to correct for gravitational deformation during horizontal patient rotation. This study aims to quantify the pelvic organ motion and the dosimetric implications of horizontal rotation for prostate intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) treatments.  Methods:   Eight human participants who previously received prostate radiation therapy were imaged in a clinical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanner using a bespoke patient rotation system (PRS). The patients were imaged every 45 degrees during a full roll rotation (0-360 degrees). Whole pelvic bone, prostate, rectum, and bladder motion were compared to the supine position using dice similarity coefficient (DSC) and mean absolute surface distance (MASD). Prostate centroid motion was compared in the left-right (LR), superior-inferior (SI), and anterior-posterior (AP) direction prior to and following pelvic bone-guided rigid registration. Seven-field prostate IMRT treatment plans were generated for each patient rotation angles under three adaption scenarios: No plan adaption, rigid planning target volume (PTV)-guided alignment to the prostate, and plan re-optimization. Prostate, rectum, and bladder doses were compared for each adaption scenario.  Results:   Pelvic bone motion within the PRS of up to 53 mm relative to the supine position was observed for some participants. Internal organ motion was greatest at the 180-degree PRS couch angle (prone), with prostate centroid motion range < 2 mm LR, 0 mm to 14 mm SI, and -11 mm to 4 mm AP. Rotation with no adaption of the treatment plan resulted in an underdose to the PTV -- in some instances up to 75% (D95%: 78 ± 0.3 Gy at supine to 20 ± 15.0 Gy at the 225-degree PRS couch angle). Bladder dose was reduced during the rotation by up to 98% (V60 Gy: 15.0 ± 9.4% supine to 0.3 ± 0.5% at the 225-degree PRS couch angle). In some instances, the rectum dose increased during rotation (V60Gy: 20.0 ± 4.5% supine to 25.0 ± 15.0% at the 135-degree PRS couch angle). Rigid PTV-guided alignment resulted in PTV coverage which, though statistically lower (P < 0.05 for all D95% values), was within 1 Gy of the supine plans. Plan re-optimization resulted in a statistically equivalent PTV coverage compared to the supine plans (P > 0.05 for all D95% metrics and all within ±0.4 Gy). For both rigid PTV-guided alignment and plan re-optimization, rectum dose volume metrics were reduced compared to the supine position between the 90- and 225-degree PRS couch angles (P < 0.05). Bladder dose volume metrics were not impacted by rotation.  Conclusion:   Pelvic bone and internal organ motion are present during patient rotation. Rigid PTV-guided alignment to the prostate will be a requirement if prostate IMRT is to be safely delivered using patient rotation. Plan re-optimization for each PRS couch angle to account for anatomical deformations further improves the PTV coverage.""","""['J G Buckley', 'J A Dowling', 'M Sidhom', 'G P Liney', 'R Rai', 'P E Metcalfe', 'L C Holloway', 'P J Keall']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Dosimetric effects of the prone and supine positions on image guided localized prostate cancer radiotherapy.', 'The dosimetric error due to uncorrected tumor rotation during real-time adaptive prostate stereotactic body radiation therapy.', 'Target miss using PTV-based IMRT compared to robust optimization via coverage probability concept in prostate cancer.', 'Robust optimization in lung treatment plans accounting for geometric uncertainty.', 'Online adaptive planning methods for intensity-modulated radiotherapy.', 'Nano X Image Guidance in radiation therapy: feasibility study protocol for cone beam computed tomography imaging with gravity-induced motion.', 'A radiomics pipeline dedicated to Breast MRI: validation on a multi-scanner phantom study.']"""

Clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP) can interfere with cfDNA testing and cause incorrect interpretation of results. There is an urgent need to better understand this problem following recent US Food and Drug Administration approval of poly(ADP) ribose polymerase inhibitors (PARPi) for metastatic prostate cancer based on variants in DNA repair genes that can be affected by CHIP.  Objective:   To determine the prevalence of clinically relevant CHIP interference in prostate cancer cfDNA testing.  Design, setting, and participants:   We report a case series of 69 patients with advanced prostate cancer (metastatic disease or with rising PSA following localized therapy) who had cfDNA variant testing with a large panel cancer next generation sequencing assay (UW-OncoPlexCT). To determine the source of variants in plasma, we tested paired cfDNA and whole blood control samples. The study was carried out in an academic medical center system reference laboratory.  Main outcomes and measures:   Prevalence and gene spectrum of CHIP interference in patients with prostate cancer undergoing cfDNA testing.  Results:   We detected CHIP variants at 2% or more variant fraction in cfDNA from 13 of 69 men with prostate cancer (19%; 95% CI, 10%-30%). Seven men (10%; 95% CI, 4%-20%) had CHIP variants in DNA repair genes used to determine PARPi candidacy, including ATM (n = 5), BRCA2 (n = 1), and CHEK2 (n = 1). Overall, CHIP variants accounted for almost half of the somatic DNA repair gene variants detected. Participant CHIP variants were exponentially correlated with older age (R2 = 0.82). CHIP interference variants could be distinguished from prostate cancer variants using a paired whole-blood control.  Conclusions and relevance:   In this case series, approximately 10% of men with advanced prostate cancer had CHIP interference in plasma cfDNA in DNA repair genes that are used for eligibility of PARPi therapy, most frequently in ATM. Clinical cfDNA testing should include a paired whole-blood control to exclude CHIP variants and avoid misdiagnosis.""","""['Kendal Jensen', 'Eric Q Konnick', 'Michael T Schweizer', 'Alexandra O Sokolova', 'Petros Grivas', 'Heather H Cheng', 'Nola M Klemfuss', 'Mallory Beightol', 'Evan Y Yu', 'Peter S Nelson', 'Bruce Montgomery', 'Colin C Pritchard']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""JAMA Oncol""","""['A CHIP in the Armor of Cell-Free DNA-Based Predictive Biomarkers for Prostate Cancer.', 'Beware Liquid Biopsies to Guide PARP Blockade.', 'Cell-Free DNA Detection of Tumor Mutations in Heterogeneous, Localized Prostate Cancer Via Targeted, Multiregion Sequencing.', 'Clinical determinants for successful circulating tumor DNA analysis in prostate cancer.', 'Beware Liquid Biopsies to Guide PARP Blockade.', 'DNA repair gene alterations testing in prostate cancer\xa0: A practical update by the prostate cancer committee of the french association of urology.', 'Using circulating cell-free DNA to monitor personalized cancer therapy.', 'Cell-free DNA in the management of prostate cancer: Current status and future prospective.', 'Circulating tumor DNA in early-stage colon cancer: ready for prime time or needing refinement?', 'Towards clinical implementation of circulating tumor DNA in metastatic prostate cancer: Opportunities for integration and pitfalls to interpretation.', 'Phase I Study of Niraparib in Combination with Radium-223 for the Treatment of Metastatic Castrate-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Olaparib Efficacy in Patients with Metastatic Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer and BRCA1, BRCA2, or ATM Alterations Identified by Testing Circulating Tumor DNA.']"""

Aberrant glycosylation is involved in neoplastic progression and specific changes in PSA glycosylation pattern, as the reduction in the percentage of α2,6-sialic acid (SA) are associated with PCa aggressiveness. In this study, we have characterised the main sialylated PSA glycoforms from blood serum of aggressive PCa patients and have compared with those of standard PSA from healthy individuals' seminal plasma. PSA was immunoprecipitated and α2,6-SA were separated from α2,3-SA glycoforms using SNA affinity chromatography. PSA N-glycans were released, labelled and analysed by hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography combined with exoglycosidase digestions. The results showed that blood serum PSA sialylated glycoforms containing GalNAc residues were largely increased in aggressive PCa patients, whereas the disialylated core fucosylated biantennary structures with α2,6-SA, which are the major PSA glycoforms in standard PSA from healthy individuals, were markedly reduced in aggressive PCa.

The aim of research was to evaluate the possible clinical value of the associations between clinical, physical, and biological factors, and risk for development of acute radiotoxicity in patients with prostate cancer. The study involved forty four patients treated with three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy. The concentrations of IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IFN-γ and TGF-β1 were assessed before radiotherapy, after 5th, 15th and 25th radiotherapy fractions, at the end, and 1 month after the end of radiotherapy. Cytokine gene expression was determined in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. The univariate analysis of circulating cytokine levels during radiotherapy showed that increased serum concentrations of IL-6 were significantly associated with higher grade of acute genitourinary toxicity. The multivariate analysis demonstrated that increased level of IL-6 during the radiotherapy was significantly associated with higher grade of acute genitourinary toxicity across treatment.

In order to increase the stability, a cyclohexane ring first replaced the acetalic 1, 3-dioxane ring of 1. A large set of aminoethyl substituted cyclohexane derivatives was prepared in a six-step synthesis. All enantiomers and diastereomers were separated by chiral HPLC at the stage of the primary alcohol 7, and their absolute configuration was determined by CD spectroscopy. Neither the relative nor the absolute configuration had a large impact on the σ1 affinity. The highest σ1 affinity was found for cis-configured benzylamines (1R,3S)-11 (Ki = 0.61 nM) and (1S,3R)-11 (Ki = 1.3 nM). Molecular dynamics simulations showed that binding of (1R,3S)-11 at the σ1 receptor is stabilized by the typical polar interaction of the protonated amino moiety with the carboxy group of E172 which is optimally oriented by an H-bond interaction with Y103. The lipophilic interaction of I124 with the N-substituent also contributes to the high σ1 affinity of the benzylamines. The antagonistic activity was determined in a Ca2+ influx assay in retinal ganglion cells. The enantiomeric cis-configured benzylamines (1R,3S)-11 and (1S,3R)-11 were able to inhibit the growth of DU145 cells, a highly aggressive human prostate tumor cell line. Moreover, cis-11 could also inhibit the growth of further human tumor cells expressing σ1 receptors. The experimentally determined logD7.4 value of 3.13 for (1R,3S)-11 is in a promising range regarding membrane penetration.

Material and methods:   A total of 154 patients who underwent mp-MRI were retrospectively included. Patients received a standardized mp-MRI, compliant with 2012 European Society of Uro-Radiology guidelines, with 1·5 T magnetic field strength and an 8 channel pelvic phased-array coil. Two blinded readers graded the image quality of mp-MRI on a three-point scale and they scored the prostate lesions according to PI-RADS v2. All PI-RADS of 4 or 5 underwent biopsy. A third radiologist and a pathologist verified the correspondence between the MRI images and the results of the biopsy.  Results:   64 (41.6%) patients showed a Pi-rads of 4 or 5. At biopsy, 79.7% showed a Gleason score ≥7, 12.5% showed a Gleason score of 6 and 7.8% showed a negative biopsy. In the group of Pi-rads ≤ 3, 12 patients underwent a biopsy with the following results: negative biopsy in 33.3%, atypical Small Acinar Proliferation in 16.7%, prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia in 25% and indolent PCa 25%. Mp-MRI in the identification of clinically significant cancer provided a low percentage of false positive (7.8%) while in 79.7% of cases it was capable to detect clinically significant prostate cancer.

A growing number of biomarkers are now available to help address this need, but these have rarely been examined together in the same patients to determine their potentially additive value.  Objective:   To determine whether two previously validated plasma markers (transforming growth factor β1 [TGFβ1] and interleukin-6 soluble receptor [IL6-SR]) and two validated tissue scores (the Genomic Evaluators of Metastatic Prostate Cancer [GEMCaP] and cell cycle progression [CCP] scores) can improve on clinical parameters in predicting adverse pathology after prostatectomy, and how much they vary within tumors with heterogeneous Gleason grade.  Design, setting, and participants:   A case-control study was conducted among men with low-risk cancers defined by biopsy grade group (GG) 1, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) ≤10 ng/mL, and clinical stage ≤ T2 who underwent immediate prostatectomy. We collected paraffin-fixed prostatectomy tissue and presurgical plasma samples from 381 cases from the University of California, San Francisco, and 260 cases from the University of Washington.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Pathologic outcomes were minor upgrading/upstaging (GG 2 or pT3a) or major upgrading/upstaging (GG ≥ 3 or ≥ pT3b), and multinomial regression was performed to determine putative markers' ability to predict these outcomes, controlling for PSA, percent of positive biopsy cores, age, and clinical site. For upgraded tumors, a secondary analysis of the GEMCaP and CCP scores from the higher-grade tumor was also performed to evaluate for heterogeneity.  Results and limitations:   Overall, 357 men had no upgrading/upstaging event at prostatectomy, 236 had a minor event, and 67 had a major event. Neither TGFβ1 nor IL6-SR was statistically significantly associated with any upgrading/upstaging. On the contrary, both the CCP and the GEMCaP score obtained from Gleason pattern 3 tissue were directly associated with minor and major upgrading/upstaging on univariate analysis. The two scores correlated with each other, but weakly. On multinomial analysis including both scores in the model, the CCP score predicted minor upgrading/upstaging (odds ratio [OR] 1.62, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.05-2.49) and major upgrading/upstaging (OR 2.26, 95% CI 1.05-4.90), p = 0.04), and the GEMCaP score also predicted minor upgrading/upstaging (OR 1.05, 95% CI 1.03-1.08) and major upgrading/upstaging (OR 1.07, 95% CI 1.04-1.11), p < 0.01). The other clinical parameters were not significant in this model. Among upgraded tumors including both Gleason patterns 3 and 4, both the GEMCaP and the CCP score tended to be higher from the higher-grade tumor. The main limitation was the use of virtual biopsies from prostatectomy tissue as surrogates for prostate biopsies.  Conclusions:   Biomarker signatures based on analyses of both DNA and RNA significantly and independently predict adverse pathology among men with clinically low-risk prostate cancer undergoing prostatectomy.  Patient summary:   Validated biomarker scores derived from both prostate cancer DNA and prostate cancer RNA can add independent information to help predict outcomes after prostatectomy.""","""['Matthew R Cooperberg', 'Janet E Cowan', 'Karla J Lindquist', 'Yasuko Kobayashi', 'Jeffry P Simko', 'Henrik Bengtsson', 'Khushboo Singh', 'Vy Ngo', 'Andrew Avila', 'Lisa F Newcomb', 'Maria Tretriakova', 'Daniel W Lin', 'Steven Stone', 'Peter R Carroll', 'Pamela L Paris']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Eur Urol""","""['Combined multiple clinical characteristics for prediction of discordance in grade and stage in prostate cancer patients undergoing systematic biopsy and radical prostatectomy.', 'Risk of Upgrading and Upstaging Among 10 000 Patients with Gleason 3+4 Favorable Intermediate-risk Prostate Cancer.', 'Determination of Whether Apex or Non-Apex Prostate Cancer Is the Best Candidate for the Use of Prostate-Specific Antigen Density to Predict Pathological Grade Group Upgrading and Upstaging after Radical Prostatectomy.', 'Old men with prostate cancer have higher risk of Gleason score upgrading and pathological upstaging after initial diagnosis: a systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Is active surveillance a suitable option for African American men with prostate cancer?

We examined the association of COVID-19 status with an extensive list of 974 medical conditions and 30 blood biomarkers. Additionally, we tested the association of genetic variants in two key genes related to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2), with COVID-19 or any other phenotypes.

The performance of this technique is affected by several factors like tissue heterogeneity, number of protons in the considered pencil beam and the detection device. Our previous work proposed a new treatment planning concept which boosts the number of protons of a few PG monitoring-friendly pencil beams (PBs), selected on the basis of two proposed indicators quantifying the conformity between the dose and PG at the emission level, above the desired detectability threshold. To further explore this method at the detection level, in this work we investigated the response of a knife-edge slit PG camera which was deployed in the first clinical application of PG to proton therapy monitoring. The REGistration Graphical User Interface (REGGUI) is employed to simulate the PG emission, PG detection as well as the corresponding dose distribution. As the PG signal detected by this kind of PG camera is sensitive to the relative position of the camera and PG signal falloff, we optimized our PB selection method for this camera by introducing a new camera position indicator identifying whether the expected falloff of the PG signal is centered in the field of view of the camera or not. Our camera-adapted PB selection method is investigated using computed tomography (CT) scans at two different treatment time points of a head and neck, and a prostate cancer patient under scenarios considering different statistics level. The results show that a precision of 0.8 mm for PG falloff identification can be achieved when a PB has more than 2 × 108 primary protons. Except for one case due to unpredictable and comparably large anatomical changes, the PG signals of most of the PBs recommended by all our indicators are observed to be reliable for proton range verification with deviations between the inter-fractional shift of proton range (as deduced from the PB dose distribution) and the detected PG signal within 2.0 mm. In contrast, a shift difference up to 9.6 mm has been observed for the rejected PBs. The magnitude of the proton range shift due to the inter-fractional anatomical changes is observed to be up to 23 mm. The proposed indicators are shown to be valuable for identifying and recommending reliable PBs to create new PG monitoring-friendly TPs. Comparison between our PB boosting method and the alternative PB aggregation, which combines the signal of nearby PBs to reach the desired counting statistics, is also discussed.""","""['Liheng Tian', 'Ze Huang', 'Guillaume Janssens', 'Guillaume Landry', 'George Dedes', 'Florian Kamp', 'Claus Belka', 'Marco Pinto', 'Katia Parodi']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Phys Med Biol""","""['A new treatment planning approach accounting for prompt gamma range verification and interfractional anatomical changes.', 'Toward a new treatment planning approach accounting for in vivo proton range verification.', 'Monte Carlo study on the sensitivity of prompt gamma imaging to proton range variations due to interfractional changes in prostate cancer patients.', 'Imaging of prompt gamma rays emitted during delivery of clinical proton beams with a Compton camera: feasibility studies for range verification.', 'Prompt-gamma fall-off estimation with C-ion irradiation at clinical energies, using a knife-edge slit camera: A Monte Carlo study.', 'Management of Motion and Anatomical Variations in Charged Particle Therapy: Past, Present, and Into the Future.']"""

Minimal data have been published directly comparing rates of biochemical control and toxicity with these 2 modalities. We hypothesize that LDR and SBRT will provide similar rates of biochemical control.  Methods and materials:   All low- and intermediate-risk patients with prostate cancer treated definitively with SBRT or LDR between 2010 and 2018 were captured. Phoenix definition was used for biochemical failure. Independent t tests were used to compare baseline characteristics, and repeated measure analysis of variance test was used to compare American Urologic Association (AUA) and the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC) scores between treatment arms over time. Biochemical control was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Differences in acute and late toxicity were assessed via Pearson χ2.  Results:   In the study, 219 and 118 patients were treated with LDR and SBRT. Median follow-up was 4.3 years (interquartile range, 3.1-6.1). All patients treated with LDR received 125.0 Gy in a single fraction. SBRT consisted of 42.5 Gy in 5 fractions. Five-year biochemical control for LDR versus SBRT was 91.6% versus 97.6% (P = .108). LDR patients had a larger increase in mean AUA scores at 1 month (17.2 vs 10.3, P < .001) and 3 months posttreatment (14.0 vs 9.7, P < .001), and in mean EPIC scores at 1 month (15.7 vs 13.8, P < .001). There was no significant difference between LDR and SBRT in late grade 3 genitourinary toxicity (0.9% vs 2.5%, P = .238); however, LDR had lower rates of late grade 3 gastrointestinal toxicity (0.0% vs 2.5%, P = .018).  Conclusions:   Our data show similar biochemical control and genitourinary toxicity rates at 5 years for both SBRT and LDR, with slightly higher gastrointestinal toxicity with SBRT and higher AUA and EPIC scores with LDR.""","""['Emile Gogineni', 'Zaker Rana', 'Danielle Soberman', 'Baho Sidiqi', ""Vincent D'Andrea"", 'Lucille Lee', 'Louis Potters', 'Bhupesh Parashar']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys""","""['Stereotactic body radiotherapy as monotherapy or post-external beam radiotherapy boost for prostate cancer: technique, early toxicity, and PSA response.', 'Early outcomes of high-dose-rate brachytherapy combined with ultra-hypofractionated radiation in higher-risk prostate cancer.', 'Long-term results of an RTOG Phase II trial (00-19) of external-beam radiation therapy combined with permanent source brachytherapy for intermediate-risk clinically localized adenocarcinoma of the prostate.', 'A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis of Local Salvage Therapies After Radiotherapy for Prostate Cancer (MASTER).', 'The direct prognosis comparison of 125I low-dose-rate brachytherapy versus laparoscopic radical prostatectomy for patients with intermediate-risk prostate cancer.', 'A comparison between high dose rate brachytherapy and stereotactic body radiotherapy boost after elective pelvic irradiation for high and very high-risk prostate cancer.', 'Biochemical failure and toxicity in treatment with brachytherapy and external beam radiotherapy compared with radical prostatectomy in localized prostate cancer.', 'Prostate Cancer Survivors Present Long-Term, Residual Systemic Immune Alterations.', 'Stereotactic Radiation Therapy versus Brachytherapy: Relative Strengths of Two Highly Efficient Options for the Treatment of Localized Prostate Cancer.', 'Comparison of toxicities between ultrahypofractionated radiotherapy versus brachytherapy with or without external beam radiotherapy for clinically localized prostate cancer.']"""

In this study, we aimed to explore whether LGR4 would affect radiation response in PCa.  Materials and methods:   LGR4 expression was silenced by shRNA transfection. qRT-PCR was employed to determine mRNA expression of LGR4 and DNA damage repair genes. Western blot was used to evaluate protein expression of LGR4, RSPO1-4, androgen receptor (AR), cyclic AMP response-element binding protein (CREB1), γH2A.X, and H2A.X. Cell proliferation was detected by CCK-8 assay and apoptosis was assayed by flow cytometry. Additionally, a xenograft model was also established to validate the role of LGR4 in PCa cells after radiation.  Key findings:   LGR4 expression was enhanced in PCa cells by radiation treatment in dose- and time-dependent means. RSPO1-4 were also upregulated post-radiation. Furthermore, LGR4 knockdown exacerbated apoptosis, reduced cell viabilities and strengthened nuclear γH2A.X staining in AR positive PCa cells but not in AR negative cells in the presence of radiation. Likewise, LGR4 ablation diminished AR and CREB1 expression induced by radiation. In contrast, RSPO1 stimulation augmented cell viabilities, promoted AR and CREB1 expression, and upregulated DNA repair gene expression, which could be reversed by enzalutamide, except for AR expression. Additionally, LGR4 knockdown further suppressed tumor growth and AR/CREB1 expression but enhanced γH2A.X expression in xenografts.  Significance:   In all, our study suggested that LGR4 might serve as an important regulator of radiation sensitivity in PCa.""","""['Fang Liang', 'Hao Zhang', 'Duo Cheng', 'Hui Gao', 'Junyong Wang', 'Junmin Yue', 'Nan Zhang', 'Jingjing Wang', 'Zhaoyang Wang', 'Beibei Zhao']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Life Sci""","""['The Role of LGR4 (GPR48) in Normal and Cancer Processes.', 'Lgr4 promotes prostate tumorigenesis through the Jmjd2a/AR signaling pathway.', 'GPCR48/LGR4 promotes tumorigenesis of prostate cancer via PI3K/Akt signaling pathway.', 'Leucine-rich repeat-containing G protein-coupled receptor 4 (Lgr4) is necessary for prostate cancer metastasis via epithelial-mesenchymal transition.', 'LGR4, a G Protein-Coupled Receptor With a Systemic Role: From Development to Metabolic Regulation.', 'Emerging Roles for LGR4 in Organ Development, Energy Metabolism and Carcinogenesis.', 'The Role of LGR4 (GPR48) in Normal and Cancer Processes.', 'LGR4 silence aggravates ischemic injury by modulating mitochondrial function and oxidative stress via ERK signaling pathway in H9c2 cells.']"""

Although the incidence of canine prostate cancer is low, several patients have resistance to androgen therapy and poor clinical prognosis. These outcomes are similar to those of end-stage human androgen-independent prostate cancer. The androgen receptor (AR) of canines has two polyglutamine (polyQ) sequences (Q × 10 and Q × 23) at its N-terminal. The length of polyQ may be a risk factor for the development of prostate cancer in dogs; however, there is no evidence to support this. Hence, we artificially created polyQ deletion mutants of canine AR and evaluated their effects on AR signalling. The deletions of Q × 10 and Q × 23 were associated with significant reductions in AR signalling intensities. The Q × 10 mutants, which increase or decrease Q sequentially, also altered AR signalling. Furthermore, the Q × 10 deletion mutant, compared with the Q × 10 control, altered the intensities of the binding of polyQ to the C-terminal of AR, which contains a ligand-binding domain; this was not observed with the Q × 9, 11, and 12 variants.

Methods:   Within the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) database, we focused on patients with T1aN0M0 RCC who underwent either radical or partial nephrectomy between 2000 and 2015. Temporal trends, Kaplan-Meier plots and multivariable Cox-regression analyses assessed CSM.  Results:   Of 43,147 T1aN0M0 patients, 12,238 (28.4%) harbored RCC < 2 cm and 30,909 (71.6%) 2.1-4 cm RCC.

Methods:   Eight prospective case-control studies nested within the Melbourne Collaborative Cohort Study were used to assess associations between maternal-smoking-associated methylation marks in blood and risk of several cancers: breast (n = 406 cases), colorectal (n = 814), gastric (n = 166), kidney (n = 139), lung (n = 327), prostate (n = 847) and urothelial (n = 404) cancer and B-cell lymphoma (n = 426). We used conditional logistic regression models to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for associations between cancer and five methylation scores calculated as weighted averages for 568, 19, 15, 28 and 17 CpG sites. Models were adjusted for confounders, including personal smoking history (smoking status, pack-years, age at starting and quitting) and methylation scores for personal smoking.  Results:   All methylation scores for maternal smoking were strongly positively associated with risk of urothelial cancer. Risk estimates were only slightly attenuated after adjustment for smoking history, other potential confounders and methylation scores for personal smoking. Potential negative associations were observed with risk of lung cancer and B-cell lymphoma. No associations were observed for other cancers.

Stockholm3, however, was developed using systematic biopsies. We aimed to assess Stockholm3 operating performance when using MRI-targeted biopsies for PC detection.  Methods:   A prospective cohort of 532 men was considered for prostate biopsy during 2016-2017. All men underwent Stockholm3 testing and MRI before biopsy. All PIRADs ≥3 lesion underwent targeted biopsy; all men underwent systematic biopsy. The primary outcome was ISUP Grade Group ≥2 (GG ≥ 2) PC. Detection strategies included: (1) systematic biopsies alone, (2) targeted biopsies alone, (3) targeted with associated systematic biopsies for MRI+, and (4) all biopsies in all men. For each strategy, the Stockholm3 operating characteristics were assessed with discrimination, calibration, and decision curve analysis (DCA).  Results:   Median age was 65 years, median PSA was 6.2 ng/mL, median Stockholm3 score was 16.5%, and overall detection of GG ≥ 2 PC was 36% (193/532). Stockholm3 showed accurate discrimination for separating GG ≥ 2 cancer from benign and GG1, with an area under the curve of 0.84-0.86 depending on the biopsy strategy. Calibration analysis showed that Stockholm3 underestimated risks for GG ≥ 2 PC risk using MRI-targeted biopsies: there was a net benefit over biopsies in all men for Stockholm3 at risk thresholds varying from >3% in systematic biopsies to >15% in targeted with systematic biopsies in MRI+ men. When using a Stockholm3 score of >10% cutoff, a range of 32-38% of biopsies could be avoided while missing 5-11% of GG ≥ 2 PC and 0-3% of GG ≥ 3 PC.  Conclusions:   Stockholm3 shows high discriminatory performance in an MRI-targeted biopsy setting, however risks are underpredicted due to MRI-targeted biopsies being more sensitive than the systematic biopsies for which Stockholm3 was developed. Stockholm3, along with any risk prediction model developed for systematic prostate biopsy decisions, will need recalibration for optimal use in an MRI-driven biopsy setting.""","""['Hari T Vigneswaran', 'Thorgerdur Palsdottir', 'Henrik Olsson', 'Erik S Haug', 'Wolfgang Picker', 'Sven Löffeler', 'Henrik Grönberg', 'Martin Eklund', 'Tobias Nordström']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Prostate Cancer Prostatic Dis""","""['Prostate Cancer Diagnostics Using a Combination of the Stockholm3 Blood Test and Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging.', 'Prostate cancer screening using a combination of risk-prediction, MRI, and targeted prostate biopsies (STHLM3-MRI): a prospective, population-based, randomised, open-label, non-inferiority trial.', 'A Unified Prostate Cancer Risk Prediction Model Combining the Stockholm3 Test and Magnetic Resonance Imaging.', 'Multiparametric MRI in detection and staging of prostate cancer.', 'Detection of Clinically Significant Prostate Cancer Using Magnetic Resonance Imaging-Ultrasound Fusion Targeted Biopsy: A Systematic Review.']"""

Metabolomic profiling of prostate tissue and serum samples was performed. Metabolite levels and metabolite sets were compared across Gleason scores. Machine learning algorithms were trained and tuned to predict transformation or differentiation status from metabolite data. A total of 135 metabolites were significantly different (P adjusted < 0.05) in tumor versus normal tissue, and pathway analysis identified one sugar metabolism pathway (P adjusted = 0.03).

N-Myc has a short half-life but acts as an NEPC stimulator when it is stabilized by forming a protective complex with Aurora A kinase (AURKA). Therefore, dual-inhibition of N-Myc and AURKA would be an attractive therapeutic avenue for NEPC. Following our computer-aided drug discovery approach, compounds exhibiting potent N-Myc specific inhibition and strong anti-proliferative activity against several N-Myc driven cell lines, were identified. Thereafter, we have developed dual inhibitors of N-Myc and AURKA through structure-based drug design approach by merging our novel N-Myc specific chemical scaffolds with fragments of known AURKA inhibitors. Favorable binding modes of the designed compounds to both N-Myc and AURKA target sites have been predicted by docking.

Circumventing these constraints, we report here the development and validation of a label free, affordable dielectrophoresis (DEP) based graphene field effect transistor (FET) sensor implemented using coplanar electrodes and integrated uniquely with a compact disc based microfluidic platform along with electronics readout for the estimation of PSA at the point of care. Design of coplanar gate electrode which has not been explored earlier is not a straightforward approach. In fact, it has been observed that there is a non-monotonic dependence of the capture of PSA molecules in the channel region of the FET with varying widths and spacings of the gate electrode. The graphene FET based PoC device with optimized coplanar gate electrode is the only label free analytical system for PSA detection requiring simple operation and achieving a detection limit of 1 pg/ml in serum with a wide dynamic range upto 4 ng/ml and appreciable selectivity against potential interferents like bovine serum albumin (BSA) and human immunoglobulin G (IgG). Further, it has been validated satisfactorily with commercially available existing systems using human serum samples.

Acid-substituted poly(pyrrole) P(Pyr-Pac) polymer contained a lot of carboxyl groups on its end site, which were suitable for attachment of anti-CCR4 antibodies. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and cyclic voltammetry (CV) were chosen to investigate electrode preparation stages and, EIS was chosen to detect the CCR4 concentration. Anti-CCR4 antibody attached biosensing surface was highly selective to CCR4 antigen, the specific interaction resulted changes in electrochemical signal. Optimization studies containing polymer amount, anti-CCR4 antibody concentration, anti-CCR4 antibody immobilization time and anti-CCR4 antibody-CCR4 antigen interaction time were studied. The developed immunosensor displayed a linear increase with concentrations of CCR4 antigen (0.02-8 pg/mL) and a low detection limit of 6.4 fg/mL. In addition, this biosensor had great reproducibility and repeatability. Moreover, the designed biosensor was successfully used for the quantification of CCR4 antigen in serum samples. The recovery for the spiked serum samples was between 98.25% and 103.99%. The suggested immunosensor illustrated a good selectivity towards some interferents including different biomarkers.

Methods:   A prospectively maintained AS database from the Southeast Louisiana Veterans Administration Medical Center, New Orleans, Lousiana was queried. We identified men with low- and very low-risk PCa (Gleason 3 + 3, PSA <10, ≤CT2a) who had undergone at least 2 prostate biopsies, including initial diagnostic and subsequent confirmatory prostate biopsies.

In turn, invasion has been shown to be regulated in part by de novo fatty acid synthesis in prostate cancer. We therefore investigated the effects of genetic ablation of Fasn on invasive potential in prostate-specific Pten knockout mice. Combined genetic ablation of Fasn and Pten reduced the weight and volume of all the prostate lobes when compared to single knockouts. The stromal reaction to microinvasion and the cell proliferation that typically occurs in Pten knockout were largely abolished by Fasn knockout. To verify that Fasn knockout indeed results in decreased invasive potential, we show that genetic ablation and pharmacologic inhibition of FASN in prostate cancer cells significantly inhibit cellular motility and invasion. Finally, combined loss of PTEN with FASN overexpression was associated with lethality as assessed in 660 prostate cancer patients with 14.2 years of median follow-up. Taken together, these findings show that de novo lipogenesis contributes to the aggressive phenotype induced by Pten loss in murine prostate and targeting Fasn may reduce the invasive potential of prostate cancer driven by Pten loss. © 2020 The Authors.

Patients and methods:   This retrospective cohort study examined men diagnosed with prostate cancer between 2005 and 2015. We collected data from Black and White men, aged ≥30 years, living within the 100 most populous counties participating in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results programme, a nationally representative dataset. The racial Index of Dissimilarity, a validated measure of segregation, was the primary exposure of interest. Outcomes of interest included advanced stage at diagnosis (Stage IV), surgery for localised disease (Stage I-II), and 10-year overall and cancer-specific survival. Multivariable Poisson regression analyses with robust error variance estimated the relative risk (RR) of advanced stage at diagnosis and surgery for localised disease at differing levels of segregation. Survival analysis was performed using competing hazards analysis.  Results:   Multivariable models estimating stage at diagnosis showed that the disparities between Black and White men disappeared at low levels of segregation. Disparities in receiving surgery for localised disease persisted across all levels of segregation. In racially stratified analyses, segregation had no effect on stage at diagnosis or surgical resection for Black patients. White patients saw a 56% (RR 0.42, P < 0.001) reduced risk of presenting at advanced stage and 20% increased likelihood (RR 1.20, P < 0.001) of surgery for localised disease.

The relationship between a patient's health literacy (HL) and SDM remains unclear. In the current study, the authors sought to identify the impact of HL on the rates of PSA screening and on the relationship between HL and SDM following the 2012 US Preventive Services Task Force recommendations against PSA screening.  Methods:   Using data from the 2016 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, the authors examined PSA screening in the 13 states that administered the optional ""Health Literacy"" module. Men aged ≥50 years were examined. Complex samples multivariable logistic regression models were computed to assess the odds of undergoing PSA screening. The interactions between HL and SDM were also examined.  Results:   A weighted sample of 12.249 million men with a rate of PSA screening of 33.4% were identified. Approximately one-third self-identified as having optimal HL. Rates of PSA screening were found to be highest amongst the highest HL group (42.2%). Being in this group was a significant predictor of undergoing PSA screening (odds ratio, 1.214; 95% confidence interval, 1.051-1.403). There was a significant interaction observed between HL and SDM (P for interaction, <.001) such that higher HL was associated with a lower likelihood of undergoing PSA screening when SDM was present.  Conclusions:   In the uncertain environment of multiple contradictory screening guidelines, men who reported higher levels of HL were found to have higher levels of screening. The authors demonstrated that increased HL may reduce the screening-promoting effect of SDM. These findings highlight the dynamic interplay between HL and SDM that should inform the creation and promulgation of SDM guidelines, specifically when considering patients with low HL.""","""['David-Dan Nguyen', 'Quoc-Dien Trinh', 'Alexander P Cole', 'Kerry L Kilbridge', 'Brandon A Mahal', 'Matt Hayn', 'Moritz Hansen', 'Paul K J Han', 'Jesse D Sammon']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Cancer""","""['Health literacy and shared decision making in prostate cancer screening: Equality versus equity.', 'Prostate cancer screening decision-making in three states: 2013 behavioral risk factor surveillance system analysis.', 'Shared decision making and prostate-specific antigen based prostate cancer screening following the 2018 update of USPSTF screening guideline.', 'Examination of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening in military and civilian men: analysis of the 2018 behavioral risk factor surveillance system.', 'American Urological Association (AUA) guideline on prostate cancer detection: process and rationale.', 'Prostate Cancer Screening.', ""African Immigrant Mothers' Views of Perinatal Mental Health and Acceptability of Perinatal Mental Health Screening: Quantitative Cross-sectional Survey Study."", 'Optimal assessment of quality of life for patients with prostate cancer.', 'Evaluating the acceptability of an online patient decision aid for the surgical management of lower urinary tract symptoms secondary to benign prostatic hyperplasia.', 'Pilot trial of telemedicine in urology: Video vs. telephone consultations.', 'Nonlinear Relationship Between Age and Likelihood of Undergoing Prostate-Specific Antigen Testing, and the Predictive Factors of Testing at Different Ages.']"""

Main methods:   The effect of exosome derived from PSGR-overexpressed PC3 cells (PC3 PSGR+ exosomes) on migration, invasion, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and stemness of low invasive cells (LNCaP and RWPE-1) was assessed. Transcriptome sequencing was performed to identify differentially expressed (DE) mRNAs in low invasive cells incubated by PC3 PSGR+ exosomes or negative control (NC) exosomes.  Key findings:   The PSGR was stably overexpressed in PC3 cells. The PC3 PSGR+ exosomes were internalized in LNCaP and RWPE-1cells, and significantly promoted cells migration and invasion. The expression of E-cadherin was decreased, and Vimentin, Snail, SOX2 and OCT4a was increased in low invasive cells after PC3 PSGR+ exosome incubation. Additionally, a total of 993 and 1170 DE mRNAs were respectively identified in LNCaP and RWPE-1 cells after PC3 PSGR+ exosome incubation, and 5 upregulated mRNAs and 11 down regulated mRNAs were shared. The DE mRNAs were predominantly implicated in ""activation of Rho GTPase activity"" and ""response to zinc ion"" in LNCaP cells, and ""extracellular matrix organization"" and ""patterning of blood vessels"" in RWPE-1 cells.

When DU145 cancer cells were treated with EXT, p-STAT3-Y705 was decreased with an IC50 of 3.2 μM. EXT decreased the expression of STAT3 target genes, such as cyclin A, cyclin D1, and BCL-2, and induced PARP cleavage, indicating apoptotic cell death. Downregulation of EXT-induced p-STAT3-Y705 was rescued by pretreating DU145 cells with antioxidants, such as N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC), indicating that reactive oxygen species (ROS) were involved in the EXT-induced inhibition of STAT3 activation. Furthermore, we proved the association of EXT with STAT3 protein by using a drug affinity responsive target stability (DARTS) assay and a cellular thermal shift assay (CETSA). EXT inhibited proliferation of DU145 cells with a GI50 of 6 μM and reduced tumor growth in mice xenografted with DU145 cells.

The purpose of this study was to develop a method to accurately register multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with CBCT images for improved DIL delineation, treatment planning, and dose monitoring in prostate radiotherapy.  Methods and materials:   We proposed a novel registration framework which considers biomechanical constraint when deforming the MR to CBCT. The registration framework consists of two segmentation convolutional neural networks (CNN) for MR and CBCT prostate segmentation, and a three-dimensional (3D) point cloud (PC) matching network. Image intensity-based rigid registration was first performed to initialize the alignment between MR and CBCT prostate. The aligned prostates were then meshed into tetrahedron elements to generate volumetric PC representation of the prostate shapes. The 3D PC matching network was developed to predict a PC motion vector field which can deform the MRI prostate PC to match the CBCT prostate PC. To regularize the network's motion prediction with biomechanical constraints, finite element (FE) modeling-generated motion fields were used to train the network. MRI and CBCT images of 50 patients with intraprostatic fiducial markers were used in this study. Registration results were evaluated using three metrics including dice similarity coefficient (DSC), mean surface distance (MSD), and target registration error (TRE). In addition to spatial registration accuracy, Jacobian determinant and strain tensors were calculated to assess the physical fidelity of the deformation field.  Results:   The mean and standard deviation of our method were 0.93 ± 0.01, 1.66 ± 0.10 mm, and 2.68 ± 1.91 mm for DSC, MSD, and TRE, respectively. The mean TRE of the proposed method was reduced by 29.1%, 14.3%, and 11.6% as compared to image intensity-based rigid registration, coherent point drifting (CPD) nonrigid surface registration, and modality-independent neighborhood descriptor (MIND) registration, respectively.  Conclusion:   We developed a new framework to accurately register the prostate on MRI to CBCT images for external beam radiotherapy. The proposed method could be used to aid DIL delineation on CBCT, treatment planning, dose escalation to DIL, and dose monitoring.""","""['Yabo Fu', 'Tonghe Wang', 'Yang Lei', 'Pretesh Patel', 'Ashesh B Jani', 'Walter J Curran', 'Tian Liu', 'Xiaofeng Yang']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Biomechanically constrained non-rigid MR-TRUS prostate registration using deep learning based 3D point cloud matching.', 'Label-driven magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) registration using weakly supervised learning for MRI-guided prostate radiotherapy.', 'MR to ultrasound image registration with segmentation-based learning for HDR prostate brachytherapy.', 'Clinical evaluation of an MRI-to-ultrasound deformable image registration algorithm for prostate brachytherapy.', 'Deep Learning in Radiation Oncology Treatment Planning for Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Review.', 'Improving the registration stability of cone-beam computed tomography with the Sphere-Mask Optical Positioning System: a feasibility study.', 'Inter-fraction deformable image registration using unsupervised deep learning for CBCT-guided abdominal radiotherapy.', 'Artificial Intelligence in Radiation Therapy.', 'Joint synthesis and registration network for deformable MR-CBCT image registration for neurosurgical guidance.', 'Real-time liver tumor localization via a single x-ray projection using deep graph neural network-assisted biomechanical modeling.']"""

Determining the clinical impact of this effect on rectal toxicity requires estimation of the amount and mobility (and stability) of rectal gas during treatment. We therefore investigated the amount of rectal gas and local inter- and intra-fractional changes of rectal gas in pelvic cancer patients.  Methods:   To estimate the volume of gas present at treatment planning, the rectal gas contents in the planning computed tomography (CT) scans of 124 bladder, 70 cervical and 2180 prostate cancer patients were calculated. To estimate inter- and intra-fractional variations in rectal gas, 174 and 131 T2-w MRIs for six cervical and eleven bladder cancer patients were used. These scans were acquired during four scan-sessions (~20-25 min each) at various time-points. Additionally, 258 T2-w MRIs of the first five prostate cancer patients treated using MRIgRT at our center, acquired during each fraction, were analyzed. Rectums were delineated on all scans. The area of gas within the rectum delineations was identified on each MRI slice using thresholding techniques. The area of gas on each slice of the rectum was used to calculate the inter- and intra-fractional group mean, systematic and random variations along the length of the rectum. The cumulative dose perturbation as a result of the gas was estimated. Two approaches were explored: accounting or not accounting for the gas at the start of the scan-session.  Results:   Intra-fractional variations in rectal gas are small compared to the absolute volume of rectal gas detected for all patient groups. That is, rectal gas is likely to remain stable for periods of 20-25 min. Larger volumes of gas and larger variations in gas volume were observed in bladder cancer patients compared with cervical and prostate cancer patients. For all patients, local cumulative dose perturbations per beam over an entire treatment in the order of 60 % were estimated when gas had not been accounted for in the daily adaption. The calculated dose perturbation over the whole treatment was dramatically reduced in all patients when accounting for the gas in the daily set-up image.  Conclusion:   Rectal gas in pelvic cancer patients is likely to remain stable over the course of an MRIgRT fraction, and also likely to reappear in the same location in multiple fractions, and can therefore result in clinically relevant over-dosage in the rectal wall. The over-dosage is reduced when accounting for gas in the daily adaption.""","""['J Shortall', 'E Vasquez Osorio', 'A Cree', 'Y Song', 'M Dubec', 'R Chuter', 'G Price', 'A McWilliam', 'K Kirkby', 'R Mackay', 'M van Herk']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Associations between volume changes and spatial dose metrics for the urinary bladder during local versus pelvic irradiation for prostate cancer.', 'Is Dose Deformation-Invariance Hypothesis Verified in Prostate IGRT?', 'Strict bladder filling and rectal emptying during prostate SBRT: Does it make a dosimetric or clinical difference?', 'The influence of the bowel and bladder preparation protocol for radiotherapy of prostate cancer using kilo-voltage cone beam CT: Our experience.', 'Dose-volume analysis of predictors for chronic rectal toxicity after treatment of prostate cancer with adaptive image-guided radiotherapy.', 'Dose outside of the prostate is associated with improved outcomes for high-risk prostate cancer patients treated with brachytherapy boost.', 'Fan beam CT-guided online adaptive external radiotherapy of uterine cervical cancer: a dosimetric evaluation.', 'Evaluation of internal margins for prostate for step and shoot intensity-modulated radiation therapy and volumetric modulated arc therapy using different margin formulas.', 'Dosimetric Effects of Air Cavities for MRI-Guided Online Adaptive Radiation Therapy (MRgART) of Prostate Bed after Radical Prostatectomy.']"""

The Enema + Diet and Diet groups had higher scores than the Control group for rectal peristalsis (p = 0.027 and 0.009, respectively), but there were no significant differences in motion artifacts on T2-weighted images. Agreement among readers was fair, with kappa values ranging from 0.25 to 0.37.

Objective:   To compare the perioperative outcomes of patients undergoing SP-EPP versus conventional multiport (MP) transperitoneal robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP).  Design, setting, and participants:   From January 2019 to January 2020, data of 100 consecutive patients who underwent SP-EPP performed by the same surgeon and 110 consecutive patients who underwent MP-RARP by three surgeons from the same institution were prospectively collected.  Intervention:   All SP-EPPs were performed in a pure single-site fashion without Trendelenburg.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Demographic characteristics as well as intra- and postoperative data of patients in both groups were analyzed. Quantitative data were described in terms of median and quartiles.  Results and limitations:   After SP-EPP, the rate of patients discharged the same day was nine times higher than that after MP-RARP (p < 0.001), and the median length of postoperative hospital stay was significantly shorter: 4.3 h (interquartile range [IQR] 3.3-17.4) versus 26.1 h (IQR 21.5-44.8). The rate of opioid use in the hospital and after discharge in the SP group was at least half that in the MP group (respectively, 32% vs 64%, p < 0.001, and 35% vs 87%, p < 0.001). The overall positive surgical margin rate as well as continence rate at 12 mo (85% vs 88%, p = 0.97) and the prostate-specific antigen relapse-free survival (p = 0.09) were statistically comparable between the SP and MP groups.  Conclusions:   Pure single-site SP-EPP was associated with a shorter length of stay as well as a decreased need for postoperative pain medication and narcotic administration in comparison with conventional transperitoneal multiport prostatectomy, with comparable postoperative complications and readmission rate.  Patient summary:   Surgical treatment of localized prostate cancer using a single-port robotic platform allows for a shorter hospital stay, less pain, and less opioid use than conventional robotic surgery without more morbidity.

Our institution transitioned from computed tomography (CT)-based planning to MRI-based planning with the hypothesis that improved visualization could reduce treatment-related toxicity. This study aimed to compare the patient-reported health-related quality of life (hrQOL) and physician-graded toxicity outcomes of CT-based and MRI-based HDR prostate brachytherapy.  Methods:   From 2016 to 2019, 122 patients with low- or intermediate-risk prostate cancer were treated with HDR brachytherapy as monotherapy. Patients underwent CT only or CT and MRI imaging for treatment planning and were grouped per treatment planning imaging modality. Patient-reported hrQOL in the genitourinary (GU), gastrointestinal (GI), and sexual domains was assessed using International Prostate Symptom Score and Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite Short Form-26 questionnaires. Baseline characteristics, changes in hrQOL scores, and physician-graded toxicities were compared between groups.  Results:   The median follow-up was 18 months. Patient-reported GU, GI, and sexual scores worsened after treatment but returned toward baseline over time. The CT cohort had a lower baseline mean International Prostate Symptom Score (5.8 vs. 7.8, p = 0.03). The other patient-reported GU and GI scores did not differ between groups. Overall, sexual scores were similar between the CT and MRI cohorts (p = 0.08) but favored the MRI cohort at later follow-up with a smaller decrease in Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite Short Form-26 sexual score from baseline at 18 months (4.9 vs. 19.8, p = 0.05). Maximum physician-graded GU, GI, and sexual toxicity rates of grade ≥2 were 68%, 3%, and 53%, respectively, with no difference between the cohorts (p = 0.31).  Conclusion:   Our study shows that CT- and MRI-based HDR brachytherapy results in similar rates of GU and GI toxicity.

With the advent of highly sensitive molecular imaging, men with limited metastatic disease burden, or oligometastatic prostate cancer, are increasingly being identified. The LOCATE trial (NCT02680041) assessed the impact of positron emission tomography (PET) with 18F-fluciclovine on management of men with prostate cancer recurrence after curative intent primary therapy and negative/equivocal conventional imaging. Here, we use LOCATE data to characterize the sites of disease recurrence and explore the potential for 18F-fluciclovine-PET/CT to evaluate oligometastatic disease.  Methods:   Eligible men (≥18 years; prior curative intent treatment of prostate cancer; recurrence based on rising PSA; negative/equivocal conventional imaging) underwent 18F-fluciclovine-PET/CT according to standard protocols. The primary outcome measure of the LOCATE trial was a revised management plan post-scan. We performed a secondary analysis of the LOCATE imaging data to characterize anatomical sites of disease recurrence and to explore the potential for 18F-fluciclovine-PET/CT to evaluate oligometastatic disease. Imaging results were stratified by baseline PSA levels and prior treatment(s) and the Fisher exact test used to analyze differences between groups. Oligometastatic disease was defined as 1-5 extraprostatic lesions (≤3 lesions in any single organ system) plus negative prostate/bed imaging (as a surrogate for primary tumor control).  Results:   Of 213 enrolled patients, 164 (77%) had undergone prostatectomy as their initial treatment; their median PSA was 0.57ng/ml. For the 49 patients with an intact prostate, the median PSA was 5.5ng/ml. The overall 18F-fluciclovine-PET/CT detection rate was 57%. Detection rates were 84% in men with intact prostates and 49% in those who had undergone prostatectomy, with the difference being attributable to prostate/bed findings (71% vs. 18%, respectively). The detection rate in lymph nodes was 29% and in bone was 11%. In total, 53/213 (25%) had oligometastatic disease. Twenty (38%) oligometastatic patients had PSA ≤1.0 ng/ml. Forty-two (79%) experienced a change to their management plan following the scan, commonly to target a lesion identified by 18F-fluciclovine-PET/CT. The majority of management changes (74%) involved a new treatment modality; however, 10 patients (24%) experienced a modification of the existing plan for radiotherapy to incorporate a boost to an area guided by the 18F-fluciclovine-PET/CT results.  Conclusion:   Even at low PSA levels, 18F-fluciclovine-PET/CT identified a diverse pattern of recurrence missed with conventional imaging. One-quarter of men had oligometastatic disease, raising the potential for 18F-fluciclovine-PET/CT to guide targeted treatment of oligometastases.""","""['Eric H Kim', 'Barry A Siegel', 'Eugene J Teoh', 'Gerald L Andriole;LOCATE Study Group']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Urol Oncol""","""['Impact of 18F-fluciclovine PET/CT on plans for androgen deprivation therapy in patients with biochemical recurrence of prostate cancer: data analysis from two prospective clinical trials.', 'More advantages in detecting bone and soft tissue metastases from prostate cancer using 18F-PSMA PET/CT.', 'The Impact of Positron Emission Tomography with 18F-Fluciclovine on the Treatment of Biochemical Recurrence of Prostate Cancer: Results from the LOCATE Trial.', 'Role of 18F-Fluciclovine and Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen PET/CT in Guiding Management of Oligometastatic Prostate Cancer: AJR Expert Panel Narrative Review.', 'Prostate-specific membrane antigen-positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PSMA-PET/CT)-guided stereotactic ablative body radiotherapy for oligometastatic prostate cancer: a single-institution experience and review of the published literature.', 'The diagnosis and treatment of castrate-sensitive oligometastatic prostate cancer: A review.', 'Oligometastatic Prostate Cancer: Current Status and Future Challenges.', '18FFluciclovine PET/CT Improves the Clinical Management of Early Recurrence Prostate Cancer Patients.', 'Recent Advances in the Management of Hormone-Sensitive Oligometastatic Prostate Cancer.', 'Clinical utility of 18F-Fluciclovine PET/CT in recurrent prostate cancer with very low (≤0.3 ng/mL) prostate-specific antigen levels.']"""

Methods:   This retrospective study analyzed 377 repeat prostate biopsies, carried out between 2.014 and 2.017, and excluding those with previous PCa or 5-alpha reductase inhibitors treatment. ASAP, mHGPIN, PINATYP, prostatic atrophy, prostatic hyperplastic atrophy, proliferative inflammatory atrophy (PIA), chronic prostatitis, acute prostatitis, or granulomatous prostatitis, were prospectively reported after 12-core transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) systematic negative previous biopsies. 3T-multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) was performed previous repeat biopsies. At least 2-core TRUS targeted biopsies of Prostate Imaging-Reporting and Data Systemv2 lesions ≥3, and/or 12-core TRUS systematic biopsy were performed in repeat prostate biopsies. The main outcome measurements were csPCa detection, which was defined when the International Society of Uro-Pathology group grade >1 and avoided biopsies. After logistic regression analysis the most efficient model was selected, nomogram was designed with internal validation, and clinical utility was analyzed.  Results:   Normal benign tissue alone was present in less than 2% of previous negative biopsies. mHGPIN (39.7%), ASAP (4.3%) and PINATYP (3.7%) failed to predict csPCa risk in repeat biopsies.

At 6% threshold, more than 20% of repeat prostate biopsies were saved without missing csPCa.  Conclusion:   Currently, mHGPIN in negative prostate biopsy seems not able to predict the risk of future csPCa.

Objectives:   In order to solve the heterogeneity and diversity of different data types related to PCa, establish a standardized lifestyle ontology, promote the exchange and sharing of disease lifestyle knowledge, and support text mining and knowledge discovery.  Methods:   The overall construction of PCLiON was created in accordance with the principles and methodology of ontology construction. Following the principles of evidence-based medicine, we screened and integrated the lifestyles and their related attributes. Protégé was used to construct and validate the semantic framework. All annotations in PCLiON were based on SNOMED CT, NCI Thesaurus, the Cochrane Library and FooDB, etc. HTML5 and ASP.NET was used to develop the independent Web page platform and corresponding intelligent terminal application.

The purpose of this study is to examine the long-term efficacy and toxicity of proton therapy for localized prostate cancer.  Methods and materials:   This was a retrospective observational study of 2021 patients from 2003 to 2014 at a single institution. Patients were classified using the risk groups defined by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines, version 4.2019. Ninety-eight percent of the patients received 74 Gy (relative biological effectiveness) in 37 fractions. Fifty-one and 6% of the patients received neoadjuvant and adjuvant androgen deprivation therapy, respectively. The outcomes were the time of freedom from biochemical relapse and the time to late toxicity by the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 4.0. The outcomes were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method and were analyzed using multivariable Cox proportional hazards models.  Results:   The median follow-up period was 84 months (interquartile range, 60-110). The 5- and 10-year freedom from biochemical relapse rates were 100% and 100%, 99% and 88%, 93% and 86%, 90% and 79%, 88% and 68%, and 76% and 63% for the very low, low, favorable intermediate, unfavorable intermediate, high, and very high-risk groups, respectively. Patients with higher risk experienced biochemical relapse after shorter periods. The 5-year rates of grade 2 or higher late genitourinary and gastrointestinal toxicity were 2.2% and 4.0%, respectively. The results of multivariable analyses indicate that younger patients more often experienced biochemical relapse.  Conclusions:   This study demonstrates the favorable biochemical controls of proton therapy even in advanced localized prostate cancer patients with a low incidence of late toxicities, supporting the feasibility of conducting prospective clinical trials. The risk groups defined by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines, version 4.2019, are useful to classify patients with localized prostate cancer. Our findings might suggest the necessity to develop a treatment strategy that accounts for the patient's age.""","""['Masaru Takagi', 'Yusuke Demizu', 'Osamu Fujii', 'Kazuki Terashima', 'Yasue Niwa', 'Takashi Daimon', 'Sunao Tokumaru', 'Nobukazu Fuwa', 'Masato Hareyama', 'Tomoaki Okimoto']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys""","""['Promising long-term results with proton therapy for localized prostate cancer.', 'Long-term outcomes in patients treated with proton therapy for localized prostate cancer.', 'Five-Year Biochemical Results, Toxicity, and Patient-Reported Quality of Life After Delivery of Dose-Escalated Image Guided Proton Therapy for Prostate Cancer.', 'Four-Year Outcomes From a Prospective Phase II Clinical Trial of Moderately Hypofractionated Proton Therapy for Localized Prostate Cancer.', 'Ten-Year Outcomes of Moderately Hypofractionated (70\xa0Gy in 28 fractions) Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy for Localized Prostate Cancer.', 'Five-year outcomes from 3 prospective trials of image-guided proton therapy for prostate cancer.', 'Image-Guided Proton Therapy: A Comprehensive Review.', 'Changes in Nutritional Status of Cancer Patients Undergoing Proton Radiation Therapy Based on Real-World Data.', 'Robot-assisted radical resection in prostate cancer comparative assessment with conventional laparoscopic prostatectomy: a retrospective comparative cohort study with single-center experience.', 'Does particle radiation have superior radiobiological advantages for prostate cancer cells?

Recent evidence demonstrates that senescent cells, while initially restricting tumorigenesis, can induce tumor progression. Here, we identify the metalloproteinase inhibitor TIMP1 as a molecular switch that determines the effects of senescence in prostate cancer. Senescence driven either by PTEN deficiency or chemotherapy limits the progression of prostate cancer in mice. TIMP1 deletion allows senescence to promote metastasis, and elimination of senescent cells with a senolytic BCL-2 inhibitor impairs metastasis. Mechanistically, TIMP1 loss reprograms the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) of senescent tumor cells through activation of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). Loss of PTEN and TIMP1 in prostate cancer is frequent and correlates with resistance to docetaxel and worst clinical outcomes in patients treated in an adjuvant setting.

We used real-world data from five countries to investigate CVD risk following GnRH agonists and antagonists in PCa men.

Multivariable Cox proportional hazard models estimated hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs), which were pooled using random-effects meta-analysis. Stratified analyses were conducted by history of CVD and age (75 years). A total of 48 757 men were on GnRH agonists and 2144 on GnRH antagonists. There was no difference in risk of any CVD for men on GnRH antagonists and agonists (HR: 1.25; 95% CI: 0.96-1.61; I2 : 64%).

Here, we observed that the methylation status in the CpG islands (CGI) of the TSPY1 promoter was negatively correlated with its expression level in different human samples. The acetyl-histone H4 and trimethylated histone H3-lysine 4, two post-translational modifications of histones occupying the TSPY1 promoter, facilitated the TSPY1 expression in PCa cells. In addition, we found that androgen accelerated the TSPY1 transcription on the condition of hypomethylated of TSPY1-CGI and promoted PCa cell proliferation. Moreover, the binding of androgen receptor (AR) to the TSPY1 promoter, enhancing TSPY1 transcription, was detected in PCa cells.

Continence was defined as the use of 'zero or one pads'. Potency was defined as the ability to achieve and maintain satisfactory erections firm enough for sexual activity or sexual intercourse. Continence and potency were subjectively determined from patient-reported outcomes (EPIC question nos. 5 and 18). The biochemical recurrence (BCR) rate was defined as two consecutive PSA levels of > 0.2 ng/mL after RARP.

Constitutively active androgen receptor (AR) spliced variants have emerged as primary means of resistance to anti-androgens and androgen synthesis inhibitors. The alternatively spliced AR variant, ARv7, has attracted significant interest due to its constitutively active status in CRPC that drives androgen-independence. Factors that are involved in regulating ARv7 levels in CRPC are not clearly known. We recently demonstrated that a protein kinase, T-LAK cell-originated protein kinase (TOPK) level correlates with the aggressiveness of prostate cancer and its invasive behavior. In this study, we investigated whether TOPK plays a role in driving androgen-independence in prostate cancer cells. Our data demonstrate that TOPK overexpression in androgen-dependent LNCaP and VCaP induces ARv7 and drives androgen-independent growth. On the other hand, pharmacological inhibition of TOPK in androgen-independent LNCaP95 and 22Rv1 represses AR transactivation, and AR stability.

Results:   In this work, a temporal systems-medicine approach is proposed for identifying time-dependent multimorbidity patterns from patient disease trajectories, by integrating data from electronic health records with genetic and phenotypic information.

An evaluation method is also presented for quantitatively assessing, in the different disease spaces, both the cluster homogeneity and the respective similarities between the associated diseases within individual trajectories. The latter can facilitate exploring the origin(s) in the identified disease patterns. The proposed integrative methodology can be applied to any longitudinal cohort and disease of interest.

Although the main proportion of ACE is synthesized by the lungs, in men, ACE is also secreted by the testes (testicular form), seminal vesicles and the prostate. In semen, the level of ACE is up to 50 times higher than in blood plasma. The substitution of highly specific epithelial cells of the prostate by tumor cells causes a dramatic decrease in ACE production by the prostate cells.  Aim:   To assess the possibility of using prostatic ACE as a new marker of prostate cancer (PCa).  Materials and methods:   ACE phenotyping in prostate of patients with PCa and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) included measurement of the activity of two ACE substrates (HHL and ZPHL); calculation of the ratio of their hydrolysis rates (ZPHL/HHL ratio); quantitative assessment of the ACE immunoreactive protein, the ratio of the immunoreactive protein to the ACE activity, as well as the conformation of ACE using a panel of monoclonal antibodies (mAb) to different epitopes of ACE.  Results:   ACE activity in tumor cells was markedly reduced and the ratio of immunoreactive ACE to its activity increased. The ratio of the hydrolysis rates of two substrates (ZPHL/HHL ratio) in patients with PCa increased compared to control group, while it was not observed in the vast majority of patients with BPH. There were several tissue samples with a histological diagnosis of BPH, but ACE phenotype was typical for PCa.  Discussion:   Since a decrease in ACE activity was found in all patients with PCa, we suggest that it may serve as a reliable and early marker of the tumor development. Changes in the ACE phenotype, which are typical for PCa, but found in patients with BPH, may indicate earlier malignant changes in prostate cells, which are not visible on routine prostate biopsy.  Conclusions:   ACE activity and its conformation in prostatic biopsies has the potential to be an early biomarker or a differential criterion for PCa. In PCa, the ACE activity in the prostate is significantly reduced, and the ZPHL/HHL ratio is markedly increased in comparison to control group. However, there were no such changes in patients with BPH. In hyperplastic processes of the prostate (BPH, PCa), there is a change in ACE sialylation, which is accompanied by an increase in the binding of ACE to mAb 3F10 compared to the control group. Patients with negative biopsy result, but properties of prostate ACE, which are typical for PCa, require close follow-up, since they may have an increased risk of subsequent developing PCa. However, due to a small sample of patients, the diagnostic potential of prostate ACE for PCa and BPH requires to be validated in a larger number of patients to confirm its predictive accuracy.""","""['V N Mamedov', 'S M Danilov', 'L M Samokhodskaya', 'D A Okhobotov', 'D M Kamalov', 'N Melnikov', 'V K Karpov', 'A V Kadrev', 'A A Kamalov']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Urologiia""","""['Tissue ACE phenotyping in prostate cancer.', 'Tissue ACE phenotyping in lung cancer.', 'Phenotyping Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme in Blood: A Necessary Approach for Precision Medicine.', 'Biomarkers of prostate cancer and potential for using ace produced in prostate gland for diagnosis of prostate cancer and benign prostatic hyperplasia.', 'The controversial relationship between benign prostatic hyperplasia and prostate cancer: the role of inflammation.']"""

We evaluated the prevalence, risk factors and the impact of UCP on survival outcomes.  Methods:   A post-hoc analysis of the COU-AA-302, a randomised phase 3 study of abiraterone plus prednisone (AAP) versus prednisone was performed. Baseline characteristics were summarised. Cox proportional-hazards model and Kaplan-Meier method were used for survival and time to event analyses, respectively. Iterative multiple imputation method was used for correlation between clinicoradiographic progression-free survival (crPFS) and overall survival (OS).  Results:   Of 736 patients with disease progression, 280 (38%) had UCP-only and 124 (17%) had UCP plus RAD. Prognostic index model high-risk group was associated with increased likelihood of UCP (p<0.0001). Median OS was 25.7 months in UCP-only and 33.0 months for RAD-only (HR 1.39; 95% CI 1.16 to 1.66; p=0.0003). UCP adversely impacted OS in both treatment groups. Lowest OS was seen in patients with prostate specific antigen (PSA)-non-response plus UCP-only progression (median OS 22.6 months (95% CI 20.7 to 24.4)). Including UCP events lowered estimates of treatment benefit-median crPFS was 13.3 months (95% CI 11.1 to 13.8) versus median rPFS of 16.5 months (95% CI 13.8 to 16.8) in AAP group. Finally, crPFS showed high correlation with OS (r=0.67; 95% CI 0.63 to 0.71).  Conclusions:   UCP is a common and clinically relevant phenomenon in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) treated with AAP or prednisone. UCP is prognostic and associated with inferior OS and post-progression survival. A combination of PSA-non-response and UCP identifies patients with poorest survival. When included in PFS analysis, UCP diminishes estimates of treatment benefit. Continued study of UCP in mCRPC is warranted.""","""['Arpit Rao', 'Howard I Scher', 'Peter De Porre', 'Margaret K Yu', 'Anil Londhe', 'Keqin Qi', 'Michael J Morris', 'Charles Ryan']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""ESMO Open""","""['Updated interim efficacy analysis and long-term safety of abiraterone acetate in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer patients without prior chemotherapy (COU-AA-302).', 'The Phase 3 COU-AA-302 Study of Abiraterone Acetate Plus Prednisone in Men with Chemotherapy-naïve Metastatic Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer: Stratified Analysis Based on Pain, Prostate-specific Antigen, and Gleason Score.', 'Impact of bone-targeted therapies in chemotherapy-naïve metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer patients treated with abiraterone acetate: post hoc analysis of study COU-AA-302.', 'Abiraterone for treatment of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Abiraterone Acetate: A Review in Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostrate Cancer.']"""

In this first-in-man phase I/II study, we assessed the safety, tolerability and immunological impact of a synthetic long peptide vaccine targeting Ras homolog gene family member C (RhoC) in patients with prostate cancer. RhoC is a small GTPase overexpressed in advanced solid cancers, metastases and cancer stem cells.  Methods:   Twenty-two patients who had previously undergone radical prostatectomy received subcutaneous injections of 0.1 mg of a single RhoC-derived 20mer peptide emulsified in Montanide ISA-51 every 2 weeks for the first six times, then five times every 4 weeks for a total treatment time of 30 weeks. The drug safety and vaccine-specific immune responses were assessed during treatment and thereafter within a 13-month follow-up period. Serum level of prostate-specific antigen was measured up to 26 months postvaccination.  Results:   Most patients (18 of 21 evaluable) developed a strong CD4 T cell response against the vaccine, which lasted at least 10 months following the last vaccination. Three promiscuouslypresented HLA-class II epitopes were identified. Vaccine-specific CD4 T cells were polyfunctional and effector memory T cells that stably expressed PD-1 (CD279) and OX-40 (CD134), but not LAG-3 (CD223). One CD8 T cell response was detected in addition. The vaccine was well tolerated and no treatment-related adverse events of grade ≥3 were observed.  Conclusion:   Targeting of RhoC induced a potent and long-lasting T cell immunity in the majority of the patients. The study demonstrates an excellent safety and tolerability profile.

The present work aims to investigate the biological basis sustaining this approach and to evaluate the potential of a hypofractionated regimen in combination with androgen deprivation therapy, one of the major standards of care for prostate cancer. Findings show that androgen receptor (AR) modulation, by use of androgens and antiandrogens, has a significant impact on cell survival, especially in hypoxic conditions (4% O2). Subsequent experiments have revealed that AR activity as a transcription factor is involved in the onset of malignant senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) and activation of DNA repair cascade. In particular, we found that AR stimulation in hypoxic conditions promotes the enhanced transcription of ATM gene, the cornerstone kinase of the DNA damage repair genes.

Magnetic nanospheres (Fe2O3) were coated with SERS-active metal and then modified with p-mercaptobenzoic acid (p-MBA) which works simultaneously as a Raman reporter and linker to an antiepithelial-cell-adhesion-molecule (anti-EpCAM) antibodies. The newly developed laser-induced SERS-active silicon substrate with a very strong enhancement factor (up to 108) and high stability and reproducibility provide the additional extra-enhancement in the sandwich plasmonic configuration of immune assay which finally leads to increase the efficiency of detection. The sensitive immune recognition of cancer cells is assisted by the introducing of the controllable external magnetic field into the microfluidic chip. Moreover, the integration of the SERS-active platform and p-MBA-labeled immuno-Ag@Fe2O3 nanostructures with microfluidic device offers less sample and analytes demand, precise operation, increase reproducibly of spectral responses, and enables miniaturization and portability of the presented approach.

Therefore, to confirm the metabolic alterations at the cellular level during FAS inhibition, we treated LNCaP-LN3 prostate cancer cells with FAS inhibitors (Fasnall, GSK2194069, and TVB-3166). With untargeted metabolomics, we observed significant changes in a total of 56 metabolites in the drug-treated groups. Among the altered metabolites, 28 metabolites were significantly changed in all of the drug-treated groups. To our surprise, despite the inhibition of FAS, which is involved in palmitate production, the cells increase their fatty acids and glycerophospholipids contents endogenously. Also, some of the notable changes in the metabolic pathways include polyamine metabolism and energy metabolism.

It is also a time consuming task and automated identification methods have been suggested as an improvement for both objectives. Multi-echo gradient echo (MEGRE) images have been utilized for manual fiducial identification with 100% detection accuracy. The aim is therefore to develop an automatic deep learning based method for fiducial identification in MRI images intended for MRI-only prostate radiotherapy. MEGRE images from 326 prostate cancer patients with fiducials were acquired on a 3T MRI, post-processed with N4 bias correction, and the fiducial center of mass (CoM) was identified. A 9 mm radius sphere was created around the CoM as ground truth. A deep learning HighRes3DNet model for semantic segmentation was trained using image augmentation. The model was applied to 39 MRI-only patients and 3D probability maps for fiducial location and segmentation were produced and spatially smoothed. In each of the three largest probability peaks, a 9 mm radius sphere was defined. Detection sensitivity and geometric accuracy was assessed. To raise awareness of potential false findings a 'BeAware' score was developed, calculated from the total number and quality of the probability peaks. All datasets, annotations and source code used were made publicly available. The detection sensitivity for all fiducials were 97.4%. Thirty-six out of thirty-nine patients had all fiducial markers correctly identified. All three failed patients generated a user notification using the BeAware score. The mean absolute difference between the detected fiducial and ground truth CoM was 0.7 ± 0.9 [0 3.1] mm. A deep learning method for automatic fiducial identification in MRI images was developed and evaluated with state-of-the-art results.

However, the concentrations of calcitriol required to have a substantive anti-cancer effect in vivo are toxic. In previous work, we had observed that the selective prolactin receptor modulator, S179D PRL, sensitized prostate cancer cells in vitro to physiological concentrations of calcitriol through an ability to increase expression of the vitamin D receptor. Here, we have investigated whether administration of S179D PRL would likewise sensitize androgen-insensitive human PC3 xenografts in vivo and do so without inducing tissue damage akin to hypervitaminosis D. Using low concentrations of both S179D PRL (250 ng/h) and calcitriol (up to 220 pg/h), we found no effect of each alone or in combination on the growth rate of tumors. However, there was increased central tumor death with their combination that was more than additive at 250 ng S179D PRL and 220 pg calcitriol per hour. Both S179D PRL and calcitriol alone were antiangiogenic, but their antiangiogenic effects were not additive. Also, both S179D PRL and calcitriol alone increased the number of apoptotic cells in tumor sections, but their combination reduced the number, suggesting more effective clearance of apoptotic cells. Histopathology of the livers and kidneys showed no changes consistent with hypervitaminosis D. We conclude that dual therapy holds promise as a means to harness the anti-tumor effects of well-tolerated doses of calcitriol.""","""['Christopher T Holland', 'Joffrey Hsu', 'Ameae M Walker']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""J Cancer Sci Clin Ther""","""['S179D prolactin increases vitamin D receptor and p21 through up-regulation of short 1b prolactin receptor in human prostate cancer cells.', 'S179D prolactin sensitizes human prostate cancer cells such that physiological concentrations of 1, 25 dihydroxy vitamin D3 result in growth inhibition and cell death.', 'A molecular mimic of phosphorylated prolactin markedly reduced tumor incidence and size when DU145 human prostate cancer cells were grown in nude mice.', 'Therapeutic potential of S179D prolactin--from prostate cancer to angioproliferative disorders: the first selective prolactin receptor modulator.', 'S179D prolactin: antagonistic agony!']"""

Materials and methods:   The expression and discriminating capability of miRNA-205 were assessed by drawing a forest plot and a summarized receiver operating characteristic (SROC) curve, using data available from 27 miRNA-array and miRNA-sequencing datasets. The miRNA-205 target genes were acquired from online prediction tools, differentially upregulated genes in PCa, and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) after miRNA-205 transfection into PCa cell lines. Functional enrichment analysis was conducted to explore the biological mechanism of miRNA-205 targets. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was applied to verify the protein level of the hub gene.  Results:   The expression of miRNA-205 in the PCa group (1,461 samples) was significantly lower than that in the noncancer group (510 samples), and the downregulation of miRNA-205 showed excellent sensitivity and specificity in differentiating between the two groups. In bone metastatic PCa, the miRNA-205 level was further reduced than in nonbone metastatic PCa, and it showed a good capability in distinguishing between the two groups. In total, 153 miRNA-205 targets were screened through the three aforementioned methods. Based on the results of functional enrichment analysis, the targets of miRNA-205 were mainly enriched during chromosome segregation and phospholipid-translocating ATPase activity and in the spindle microtubule and the p53 signaling pathway. CDK1 had the highest connectivity in the PPI network analysis and was screened as one of the hub genes. A statistically significant negative correlation between miRNA-205 and CDK1 was observed. The expression of CDK1 in PCa samples was pronouncedly upregulated in terms of both the mRNA level and the protein level when compared with noncancer samples.

Previous studies have revealed that BYSL has important roles in embryo implantation and prostate cancer infiltration. However, the role and mechanism of BYSL in glioblastoma (GBM) cell migration and invasion remain unknown. We found that knockdown of BYSL inhibited cell migration and invasion, downregulated the expression of mesenchymal markers (e.g., β-catenin and N-cadherin), and upregulated the expression of epithelial marker E-cadherin in GBM cell lines. Overexpression of BYSL promoted GBM cell migration, invasion, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). In addition, the role of BYSL in promoting EMT was further confirmed in a glioma stem cell line derived from a GBM patient. Mechanistically, overexpression of BYSL increased the phosphorylation of GSK-3β and the nuclear distribution of β-catenin. Inhibition of GSK-3β by 1-Azakenpaullone could partially reverse the effects of BYSL downregulation on the transcriptional activity of β-catenin, the expression of EMT markers, and GBM cell migration/invasion. Moreover, immunohistochemical analysis showed strong expression of BYSL in GBM tissues, which was positively correlated with markers of mesenchymal GBM.

The purpose of this project was to analyse a cohort of patients recruited into REQUITE using a deep learning algorithm to identify patient-specific features associated with the development of toxicity, and test the approach by attempting to validate previously published genetic risk factors. Methods: The study involved REQUITE prostate cancer patients treated with external beam radiotherapy who had complete 2-year follow-up. We used five separate late toxicity endpoints: ≥grade 1 late rectal bleeding, ≥grade 2 urinary frequency, ≥grade 1 haematuria, ≥ grade 2 nocturia, ≥ grade 1 decreased urinary stream. Forty-three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) already reported in the literature to be associated with the toxicity endpoints were included in the analysis. No SNP had been studied before in the REQUITE cohort. Deep Sparse AutoEncoders (DSAE) were trained to recognize features (SNPs) identifying patients with no toxicity and tested on a different independent mixed population including patients without and with toxicity. Results: One thousand, four hundred and one patients were included, and toxicity rates were: rectal bleeding 11.7%, urinary frequency 4%, haematuria 5.5%, nocturia 7.8%, decreased urinary stream 17.1%. Twenty-four of the 43 SNPs that were associated with the toxicity endpoints were validated as identifying patients with toxicity. Twenty of the 24 SNPs were associated with the same toxicity endpoint as reported in the literature: 9 SNPs for urinary symptoms and 11 SNPs for overall toxicity.

The bacterium has been associated with a variety of diseases, including acne vulgaris, prosthetic joint infections, prostate cancer, and sarcoidosis. The accumulation of C. acnes in diseases such as acne and prostate cancer has been shown to correlate with enhanced inflammation. While the C. acnes-induced proinflammatory axis, via NF-κB and MAPK signaling and inflammasome activation, has been investigated over the last few decades, the potential role of C. acnes in triggering the type I interferon (IFN-I) pathway has not been addressed. Our results show that C. acnes induces the IFN-I signaling axis in human macrophages by triggering the cGAS-STING pathway. In addition, IFN-I signaling induced by C. acnes strongly depends on the adapter protein TRIF in a non-canonical manner; these signaling events occurred in the absence of any detectable intracellular replication of the bacterium. Collectively, our results provide important insight into C. acnes-induced intracellular signaling cascades in human macrophages and suggest IFN-I as a factor in the etiology of C. acnes-induced diseases. This knowledge may be valuable for developing novel therapies targeting C. acnes in diseases where the accumulation of the bacterium leads to an inflammatory pathology.""","""['Katrin Fischer', 'Roland Tschismarov', 'Andreas Pilz', 'Susy Straubinger', 'Sebastian Carotta', 'Andrew McDowell', 'Thomas Decker']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Front Immunol""","""['Brucella abortus Triggers a cGAS-Independent STING Pathway To Induce Host Protection That Involves Guanylate-Binding Proteins and Inflammasome Activation.', 'Salmonella Induces the cGAS-STING-Dependent Type I Interferon Response in Murine Macrophages by Triggering mtDNA Release.', 'cGAS and Ifi204 cooperate to produce type I IFNs in response to Francisella infection.', 'Molecular mechanisms and cellular functions of cGAS-STING signalling.', 'COVID-19 Molecular Pathophysiology: Acetylation of Repurposing Drugs.', 'cGAMP the travelling messenger.', 'Anti-Inflammatory and Anti-Quorum Sensing Effect of Camellia sinensis Callus Lysate for Treatment of Acne.', 'The Role of cGAS-STING in Age-Related Diseases from Mechanisms to Therapies.', 'Genomics of Invasive Cutibacterium acnes Isolates from Deep-Seated Infections.', 'Alterations in the nasopharyngeal microbiome associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection status and disease severity.']"""

Objective:   To characterise ATM-deficient lethal PC and to study synthetic lethal therapeutic strategies for this subset.  Design, setting, and participants:   We studied advanced PC biopsies using validated immunohistochemical (IHC) and next-generation sequencing (NGS) assays. In vitro cell line models modified using CRISPR-Cas9 to impair ATM function were generated and used in drug-sensitivity and functional assays, with validation in a patient-derived model.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   ATM expression by IHC was correlated with clinical outcome using Kaplan-Meier curves and log-rank test; sensitivity to different drug combinations was assessed in the preclinical models.  Results and limitations:   Overall, we detected ATM IHC loss in 68/631 (11%) PC patients in at least one biopsy, with synchronous and metachronous intrapatient heterogeneity; 46/71 (65%) biopsies with ATM loss had ATM mutations or deletions by NGS. ATM IHC loss was not associated with worse outcome from advanced disease, but ATM loss was associated with increased genomic instability (NtAI:number of subchromosomal regions with allelic imbalance extending to the telomere, p = 0.005; large-scale transitions, p = 0.05). In vitro, ATM loss PC models were sensitive to ATR inhibition, but had variable sensitivity to PARP inhibition; superior antitumour activity was seen with combined PARP and ATR inhibition in these models.  Conclusions:   ATM loss in PC is not always detected by targeted NGS, associates with genomic instability, and is most sensitive to combined ATR and PARP inhibition.

Breast, prostate, and cervical cancer are among the most frequent types in developing countries. Assessing their incidence and mortality by regions and municipalities is important to guide evidence-based health policy. Our aim was to describe the incidence and mortality trends for breast, cervical, and prostate cancer across regions and municipalities in Colombia during 2018.  Methods:   We performed a cross-sectional analysis with data from people with breast, prostate, or cervical cancer, reported to the National Administrative Cancer Registry during 2018. A descriptive analysis was performed. Age-standardized incidence and mortality rates were estimated at national, regional, and municipal levels. Finally, we identify the regions and municipalities with significantly higher or lower incidence and mortality rates compared to national estimations.  Results:   Breast cancer was the most frequent type among all new cases and deaths in Colombia. Breast, prostate and cervical cancer incidence and mortality rates per 100,000 were: 18.69 (CI 95%: 18.15-19.25) and 10.48 (CI 95%: 10.07-10.91); 11.34 (CI 95%: 10.90-11.78) and 7.58 (CI 95%: 7.22-7.96); 5.93 (CI 95%: 5.62-6.25) and 4.31 (CI 95%: 4.05-4.58), respectively. Eastern region had both, incidence and mortality rates, significantly lower than national for all types of cancer. By municipalities, there was a heterogeneous pattern. Nonetheless, Agua de Dios (Cundinamarca), had one of the highest incidence rates for all types.  Conclusions:   We observed clear differences in cancer incidence and mortality across regions and municipalities, depending on each type of cancer.

Through the market, it was found that many pharmacological drugs containing the pyran and pyridine nucleus were known.  Objective:   We are aiming in this work to synthesize target molecules possess not only anti-tumor activities but also kinase inhibitors. The target molecules were obtained starting from cyclohexane-1,3-dione followed by its heterocyclization reactions to produce anticancer target molecules.  Methods:   This work demonstrated multi-component reactions of cyclohexan-1,3-dione with aromatic aldehydes and diethylmalonate using triethylamine as a catalyst to give the 7,8-dihydro-4H-chromen-5(6H)-one derivatives 4a-c. The reaction of compounds 4a-c with either of hydrazine hydrate of phenylhydrazine gave the chromeno[2,3-c]pyrazole derivatives 5a-f, respectively. In addition, further heterocyclization reactions were adopted to give the chromeno[3,2-d]isoxazole, chromene-3-carboxamide derivatives. Moreover, the multicomponent reaction of cyclohexan-1,3-dione (1) with either of aromatic aldehydes and diethylmalonate using a catalytic amount of ammonium acetate gave the 1,4,5,6,7,8-hexahydroquinoline derivatives 13a-c. The antiproliferative activities of the synthesized compounds toward the six cancer cell lines namely A549, H460, HT- 29, MKN-45, U87MG, and SMMC-7721 were studied. In addition, the c-Met enzymatic activities and inhibition toward the prostate cancer cell PC-3 were measured.  Results:   Anti-proliferative evaluations, c-Met enzymatic activities and inhibition toward the prostate cancer cell PC-3 were measured, and the results obtained in most cases indicated that the presence of electronegative Cl group through the molecule favour the inhibitions.

Determination of epitopes that elicit an appropriate response to the antibody generation is vital for diagnostic and immunotherapeutic purposes for prostate cancer treatment. Presently, bioinformatics B-cell prediction tools can predict the location of epitopes, which is uncomplicated, faster, and more cost-effective than experimental methods.  Objective:   We aimed to predict a novel linear peptide for Prostate Stem Cell Antigen (PSCA) protein in order to generate anti-PSCA-peptide (p) antibody and to investigate its effect on prostate cancer cells.  Methods:   In the current study, a novel linear peptide for PSCA was predicted using in silico methods that utilize a set of linear B-cell epitope prediction tools. Polyclonal antibody (anti-PSCA-p antibody ""Patent No. 99318"") against PSCA peptide was generated. The antibody reactivity was determined by the Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) and its specificity by immunocytochemistry (ICC), immunohistochemistry (IHC), and Western Blotting (WB) assays. The effect of the anti-PSCA-p antibody on PSCA-expressing prostate cancer cell line was assessed by Methylthiazolyldiphenyl- Tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay.  Results:   New peptide-fragment of PSCA sequence as ""N-CVDDSQDYYVGKKN-C"" (PSCA-p) was selected and synthesized. The anti-PSCA-p antibody against the PSCA-p showed immunoreactivity with PSCA-p specifically bound to PC-3 cells. Also, the anti-PSCA-p antibody strongly stained the prostate cancer tissues as compared to Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH) and normal tissues (P < 0.001). As the degree of malignancy increased, the staining intensity was also elevated in prostate cancer tissue (P < 0.001). Interestingly, the anti-PSCA-p antibody showed anti-proliferative effects on PC-3 cells (31%) with no growth inhibition effect on PSCA-negative cells.  Conclusion:   In this study, we developed a new peptide sequence (PSCA-p) of PSCA. The PSCA-p targeting by anti-PSCA-p antibody inhibited the proliferation of prostate cancer cells, suggesting the potential of PSCA-p immunotherapy for future prostate cancer studies.""","""['Milad Chizari', 'Sajad Fani-Kheshti', 'Jaleh Taeb', 'Mohammad M Farajollahi', 'Monireh Mohsenzadegan']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Recent Pat Anticancer Drug Discov""","""['Dual antigen target-based immunotherapy for prostate cancer eliminates the growth of established tumors in mice.', 'Prostate stem cell antigen is a promising candidate for immunotherapy of advanced prostate cancer.', 'MRl of prostate cancer antigen expression for diagnosis and immunotherapy.', 'Prostate stem cell antigen: a prospective therapeutic and diagnostic target.', 'Prostate stem cell antigen: a Jekyll and Hyde molecule?']"""

Methods:   We used a combination of single-cell transcriptomics, cell culture models and biophysical methods such as nanoparticle tracking analysis and electron microscopy to investigate intercellular communication in the MB tumor niche.  Results:   Tumor cells of the sonic hedgehog (SHH)-MB subgroup show a differentiation blockade. These cells undergo extensive metabolic reprogramming. The gene expression profiles of individual tumor cells show a partial convergence with those of tumor-associated glial and immune cells. One possible cause is the transfer of extracellular vesicles (EVs) between cells in the tumor niche. We were able to detect EVs in co-culture models of MB tumor cells and oligodendrocytes. We also identified a gene expression signature, EVS, which shows overlap with the proteome profile of large oncosomes from prostate cancer cells. This signature is also present in MB patient samples.

Previous studies have reported an inverse relationship between some food items or dietary patterns and prostate cancer risk. Polyphenols, as antioxidant and anti-inflammatory dietary components, have been associated with a reduced risk of PCa, whilst dietary indices such as total antioxidant capacity are good predictors of PCa risk.  Objective:   The purpose of this study was to conduct a case-control study on the association between polyphenol intake and DTAC (dietary total antioxidant capacity) and PCa risk in men.  Method:   205 hospital-based controls and 97 newly diagnosed PCa patients were asked about their dietary intakes using a validated questionnaire. The polyphenol contents (flavonoids, lignans, stilbenes and phenolic acids) of foods and beverages were calculated. TAC was obtained using a comprehensive database consisting of the total antioxidant content of more than 3000 food and beverages. Logistic regression was used to determine the odds ratios (OR), with 95% confidence intervals (CI), of PCa according to categories of polyphenol intake and TAC.

HNF1B suppresses EZH2-mediated migration of two prostate cancer cell lines via represses the EMT process by inhibiting SLUG expression. Besides, HNF1B expression inhibits cell proliferation through unknown mechanisms. Here, we demonstrated that HNF1B inhibited the proliferation rate of prostate cancer cells. Overexpression of HNF1B in prostate cancer cells led to the arrest of G1 cell cycle and decreased Cyclin D1 expression. In addition, we re-explored data from ChIP-sequencing (ChIP-seq) and RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq), and demonstrated that HNF1B repressed Cyclin D1 via direct suppression of SMAD6 expression. We also identified CDKN2A as a HNF1B-interacting protein that would contribute to HNF1B-mediated repression of SMAD6 expression.

However, the expression of TERF1 and its mechanism in prostate cancer (PCa) remains unclear. The present study aimed to explore the expression and functions of TERF1 in PCa. The UALCAN database was used to analyze the differential expression of TERF1 between normal prostate tissue and primary PCa tissue. Cell apoptosis was analyzed by Annexin V/propidium iodide staining, and wound healing and Transwell assays were used to detect the cell migration and invasion abilities, respectively. The cell viability was analyzed using an MTT assay. Reverse transcription‑quantitative PCR and western blotting were used to analyze the mRNA and protein expression levels, respectively, of epithelial‑mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers following TERF1 knockdown in the PC3 cell line. A dual luciferase reporter assay was used to verify the association between TERF1 and microRNA (miR)‑155 predicted by bioinformatics analysis. Rescue experiments were performed to determine the role of the miR‑155/TERF1 axis in regulating the cellular behaviors of PCa. The results demonstrated that the expression levels of TERF1 in the primary prostate tumors were significantly downregulated compared with in prostate normal tissue. TERF1 silencing was discovered to significantly promote cell viability, migration and invasion, while suppressing cell apoptosis. The impact of TERF1 on PC3 cells was suggested to occur through the EMT pathway. TERF1 was confirmed to be the direct target of miR‑155. The overexpression of miR‑155 promoted the viability, migration and invasion, while suppressing the apoptosis of the PC3 cell line, while the knockdown of miR‑155 in PC3 cells achieved the opposite trends. In addition, TERF1 overexpression reversed the promotive effects of upregulated miR‑155 expression levels on the migration and apoptosis of PC3 cells. On the contrary, the knockdown of TERF1 reversed the migration and apoptosis abilities of the downregulated miR‑155 expression levels on the cellular behaviors of PC3 cells. In conclusion, TERF1, as a direct target of miR‑155, was discovered to be significantly downregulated in PCa, which was suggested to promote the migration and invasion of PCa via the EMT pathway.""","""['Wei Chen', 'Li-Na He', 'Yong Liang', 'Xiang Zeng', 'Cui-Ping Wu', 'Ming-Qiang Su', 'Yang Cheng', 'Jian-Hui Liu']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Mol Med Rep""","""['Downregulation of lncRNA ZEB1-AS1 Represses Cell Proliferation, Migration, and Invasion Through Mediating PI3K/AKT/mTOR Signaling by miR-342-3p/CUL4B Axis in Prostate Cancer.', 'UBE2C, Directly Targeted by miR-548e-5p, Increases the Cellular Growth and Invasive Abilities of Cancer Cells Interacting with the EMT Marker Protein Zinc Finger E-box Binding Homeobox 1/2 in NSCLC.', 'Long non-coding RNA VIM-AS1 promotes prostate cancer growth and invasion by regulating epithelial-mesenchymal transition.', 'The role of leucine-rich alpha-2-glycoprotein-1 in proliferation, migration, and invasion of tumors.', 'Prostate cancer and microRNAs: New insights into apoptosis.', 'MiR-124-3p inhibits tumor progression in prostate cancer by targeting EZH2.', 'MiR-363-3p promotes prostate cancer tumor progression by targeting Dickkopf 3.', 'Prognostic value of TERF1 expression in prostate cancer.', 'Anti‑inflammatory role of microRNA‑429 in human gingival epithelial cells‑inhibition of IL‑8 production through direct binding to IKKβ mRNA.']"""

Motivated by promising results in prostate cancer, there is growing interest in extending this approach to other neoplasms. As such, it is urgent to understand the characteristics of a cancer that determine whether or not it will respond well to adaptive therapy. A plausible candidate for such a selection criterion is the fitness cost of resistance. In this article, we study a general, but simple, mathematical model to investigate whether the presence of a cost is necessary for adaptive therapy to extend the time to progression beyond that of a standard-of-care continuous therapy. Tumor cells were divided into sensitive and resistant populations and we model their competition using a system of two ordinary differential equations based on the Lotka-Volterra model. For tumors close to their environmental carrying capacity, a cost was not required. However, for tumors growing far from carrying capacity, a cost may be required to see meaningful gains. Notably, it is important to consider cell turnover in the tumor, and we discuss its role in modulating the impact of a resistance cost. To conclude, we present evidence for the predicted cost-turnover interplay in data from 67 patients with prostate cancer undergoing intermittent androgen deprivation therapy. Our work helps to clarify under which circumstances adaptive therapy may be beneficial and suggests that turnover may play an unexpectedly important role in the decision-making process. SIGNIFICANCE: Tumor cell turnover modulates the speed of selection against drug resistance by amplifying the effects of competition and resistance costs; as such, turnover is an important factor in resistance management via adaptive therapy.See related commentary by Strobl et al., p. 811.""","""['Maximilian A R Strobl', 'Jeffrey West', 'Yannick Viossat', 'Mehdi Damaghi', 'Mark Robertson-Tessi', 'Joel S Brown', 'Robert A Gatenby', 'Philip K Maini#', 'Alexander R A Anderson#']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Cancer Res""","""['Adaptive Therapy and the Cost of Drug-Resistant Mutants.', 'Adaptive Therapy and the Cost of Drug-Resistant Mutants.', 'Spatial structure impacts adaptive therapy by shaping intra-tumoral competition.', 'Adaptive Therapy and the Cost of Drug-Resistant Mutants.', 'Intermittent vs Continuous Androgen Deprivation Therapy for Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.', 'A nonlinear competitive model of the prostate tumor growth under intermittent androgen suppression.', 'Intermittent androgen deprivation therapy in advanced prostate cancer.', 'Effective dose window for containing tumor burden under tolerable level.', 'A combined experimental-computational approach uncovers a role for the Golgi matrix protein Giantin in breast cancer progression.', 'Evolution-Informed Strategies for Combating Drug Resistance in Cancer.', 'Adaptive therapy for ovarian cancer: An integrated approach to PARP inhibitor scheduling.', 'A survey of open questions in adaptive therapy: Bridging mathematics and clinical translation.']"""

However its widespread testing, especially outside of gastrointestinal cancer, is hampered by tissue availability.  Methods:   An algorithm for detecting MSI from peripheral blood was established and validated using clinical plasma samples. Its value for predicting ICB efficacy was evaluated among 60 patients with advanced gastrointestinal cancer. The landscape of MSI in blood was also explored among 5138 advanced solid tumors.  Results:   The algorithm included 100 microsatellite markers with high capture efficiency, sensitivity, and specificity. In comparison with orthogonal tissue PCR results, the method displayed a sensitivity of 82.5% (33/40) and a specificity of 96.2% (201/209), for an overall accuracy of 94.0% (234/249). When the clinical validation cohort was dichotomized by pretreatment blood MSI (bMSI), bMSI-high (bMSI-H) predicted both improved progression-free survival and overall survival than the blood microsatellite stable (bMSS) patients (HRs: 0.431 and 0.489, p=0.005 and 0.034, respectively). Four patients with bMSS were identified to have high blood tumor mutational burden (bTMB-H) and trended towards a better survival than the bMSS-bTMB-low (bTMB-L) subset (HR 0.026, 95% CI 0 to 2.635, p=0.011). These four patients with bMSS-bTMB-H plus the bMSI-H group collectively displayed significantly improved survival over the bMSS-bTMB-L patients (HR 0.317, 95% CI 0.157 to 0.640, p<0.001). Pan-cancer prevalence of bMSI-H was largely consistent with that shown for tissue except for much lower rates in endometrial and gastrointestinal cancers, and a remarkably higher prevalence in prostate cancer relative to other cancer types.

We enrolled 56 patients in our study, 28 negative and 28 positive for cancer based on tissue biopsy results. Using our Vn96 peptide affinity method, we isolated EVs from post-digital rectal exam urines and used quantitative polymerase chain reaction to measure several mRNA and miRNA targets. We identified a panel of seven mRNA biomarkers whose expression ratio discriminated non-cancer from cancer with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.825, sensitivity of 75% and specificity of 84%. We also identified two miRNAs whose combined score yielded an AUC of 0.744. A model pairing the seven mRNA and two miRNA panels yielded an AUC of 0.843, sensitivity of 79% and specificity of 89%. Addition of EV-derived PCA3 levels and clinical characteristics to the biomarker model further improved test accuracy. An AUC of 0.955, sensitivity of 86% and specificity of 93% were obtained.

Between the regular segmentation stream and edge stream, we introduce an edge recalibration module at each resolution level to connect the intermediate layers and deliver the higher-level activations from the regular stream to the edge stream to denoise the irrelevant activations. (c) Finally, using a 3D Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling (ASPP) feature fusion module, we fuse the features at different scales in the regular stream and the predictions from the edge stream to form the final segmentation result. The proposed segmentation network was evaluated on 200 prostate cancer patient CT images with manually delineated contours of bladder, rectum, seminal vesicle, and prostate. The segmentation performance of the proposed method was quantitatively evaluated using three metrics including Dice similarity coefficient (DSC), average surface distance (ASD), and 95% surface distance (95SD). The proposed MTER-Net achieves average DSC of 86.35%, ASD of 1.09 mm, and 95SD of 3.53 mm on the four organs, which outperforms the state-of-the-art segmentation networks by a large margin. Specifically, the quantitative DSC evaluation results of the four organs are 96.49% (bladder), 86.39% (rectum), 76.38% (seminal vesicle), and 86.14% (prostate), respectively. In conclusion, we demonstrate that the proposed MTER-Net efficiently attains superior performance to state-of-the-art pelvic organ segmentation methods.""","""['Nuo Tong', 'Shuiping Gou', 'Shuzhe Chen', 'Yao Yao', 'Shuyuan Yang', 'Minsong Cao', 'Amar Kishan', 'Ke Sheng']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Phys Med Biol""","""['ARPM-net: A novel CNN-based adversarial method with Markov random field enhancement for prostate and organs at risk segmentation in pelvic CT images.', 'Self-channel-and-spatial-attention neural network for automated multi-organ segmentation on head and neck CT images.', 'Male pelvic multi-organ segmentation using token-based transformer Vnet.', 'EG-Unet: Edge-Guided cascaded networks for automated frontal brain segmentation in MR images.', 'EIU-Net: Enhanced feature extraction and improved skip connections in U-Net for skin lesion segmentation.', 'Anatomical evaluation of deep-learning synthetic computed tomography images generated from male pelvis cone-beam computed tomography.', 'Automatic segmentation of prostate and extracapsular structures in MRI to predict needle deflection in percutaneous prostate intervention.', 'Dosimetric impact of deep learning-based CT auto-segmentation on radiation therapy treatment planning for prostate cancer.', 'Automatic segmentation of high-risk clinical target volume for tandem-and-ovoids brachytherapy patients using an asymmetric dual-path convolutional neural network.']"""

Flubendazole is a well-known anti-malarial drug that is recently reported to be a potential anti-tumor agent in various types of human cancer cells. However, whether flubendazole could inhibit the castration-resistant prostate cancer has not been well charified. Thus, the aim of the present study was to characterize the precise mechanism of action of flubendazole on the CRPC. In this study, we investigated the potential effect of flubendazole on cell proliferation, cell cycle and cell death in CRPC cells (PC3 and DU145). We found that flubendazole inhibited cell proliferation, caused cell cycle arrest in G2/M phase and promoted cell death in vitro, and suppressed growth of CRPC tumor in xenograft models. In addition, we reported that flubendazole induced the expression of P53, which partly accounted for the G2/M phase arrest and led to inhibition of the transcription of SLC7A11, and then downregulated the GPX4, which is a major ferroptosis-related gene. Furthermore, flubendazole exhibited synergistic effect with 5-fluorouracil (5-Fu) in chemotherapy of CRPC. This study provides biological evidence that flubendazole is a novel P53 inducer which exerts anti-proliferation and pro-apoptosis effects in CRPC through hindering the cell cycle and activating the ferroptosis, and indicates that a novel utilization of flubendazole in neoadjuvant chemotherapy of CRPC.""","""['Xumin Zhou', 'Libin Zou', 'Wenbin Chen', 'Taowei Yang', 'Junqi Luo', 'Kaihui Wu', 'Fangpeng Shu', 'Xiao Tan', 'Yu Yang', 'Shengren Cen', 'Chuanyin Li', 'Xiangming Mao']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Pharmacol Res""","""['Caffeic acid phenethyl ester induced cell cycle arrest and growth inhibition in androgen-independent prostate cancer cells via regulation of Skp2, p53, p21Cip1 and p27Kip1.', 'Ferroptosis inducer erastin downregulates androgen receptor and its splice variants in castration‑resistant prostate cancer.', 'Ferroptosis Inducers Are a Novel Therapeutic Approach for Advanced Prostate Cancer.', 'Emerging insights on functions of the anthelmintic flubendazole as a repurposed anticancer agent.', 'Flubendazole Plays an Important Anti-Tumor Role in Different Types of Cancers.', 'Flubendazole inhibits PD-1 and suppresses melanoma growth in immunocompetent mice.', 'Ferroptosis and the bidirectional regulatory factor p53.', 'Ferroptosis: the vulnerability within a cancer monster.', 'Drug Repurposing Flubendazole to Suppress Tumorigenicity via PCSK9-dependent Inhibition and Potentiate Lenvatinib Therapy for Hepatocellular Carcinoma.', 'Ferroptosis landscape in prostate cancer from molecular and metabolic perspective.']"""

Methods:   A total of 295 men enrolled on an AS programme between 2011 and 2018 were included. Baseline multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) was performed at AS entry to guide biopsy. The follow-up mpMRI studies were prospectively reported by two sub-specialist uroradiologists with 10 years and 13 years of experience. PRECISE scores were dichotomized at the cut-off value of 4, and the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value were calculated. Diagnostic performance was further quantified by using area under the receiver operating curve (AUC) which was based on the results of targeted MRI-US fusion biopsy. Univariate analysis using Cox regression was performed to assess which baseline clinical and mpMRI parameters were related to disease progression on AS.  Results:   Progression rate of the cohort was 13.9% (41/295) over a median follow-up of 52 months. With a cut-off value of category ≥ 4, the PRECISE scoring system showed sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV for predicting progression on AS of 0.76, 0.89, 0.52 and 0.96, respectively. The AUC was 0.82 (95% CI = 0.74-0.90). Prostate-specific antigen density (PSA-D), Likert lesion score and index lesion size were the only significant baseline predictors of progression (each p < 0.05).  Conclusion:   The PRECISE scoring system showed good overall performance, and the high NPV may help limit the number of follow-up biopsies required in patients on AS.  Key points:   • PRECISE scores 1-3 have high NPV which could reduce the need for re-biopsy during active surveillance. • PRECISE scores 4-5 have moderate PPV and should trigger either close monitoring or re-biopsy. • Three baseline predictors (PSA density, lesion size and Likert score) have a significant impact on the progression-free survival (PFS) time.""","""['Iztok Caglic', 'Nikita Sushentsev', 'Vincent J Gnanapragasam', 'Evis Sala', 'Nadeem Shaida', 'Brendan C Koo', 'Vasily Kozlov', 'Anne Y Warren', 'Christof Kastner', 'Tristan Barrett']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Eur Radiol""","""['Urological Oncology: Prostate Cancer.', 'Multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging can exclude prostate cancer progression in patients on active surveillance: a retrospective cohort study.', 'Outcomes of Serial Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Subsequent Biopsy in Men with Low-risk Prostate Cancer Managed with Active Surveillance.', 'The role of multiparametric magnetic resonance in active surveillance of a low-risk prostate cancer cohort from clinical practice.', 'Prostate Indeterminate Lesions on Magnetic Resonance Imaging-Biopsy Versus Surveillance: A Literature Review.', 'Reliability of Serial Prostate Magnetic Resonance Imaging to Detect Prostate Cancer Progression During Active Surveillance: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.', 'Using a Recurrent Neural Network To Inform the Use of Prostate-specific Antigen (PSA) and PSA Density for Dynamic Monitoring of the Risk of Prostate Cancer Progression on Active Surveillance.', 'mpMRI Interpretation in Active Surveillance for Prostate Cancer-An overview of the PRECISE score.', 'Active Surveillance for Prostate Cancer: Past, Current, and Future Trends.', 'Commentary: considering radiomics in the setting of prostate cancer active surveillance.', 'Generative Adversarial Networks Can Create High Quality Artificial Prostate Cancer Magnetic Resonance Images.']"""

Objective:   To evaluate overall progression-free survival (PFS), widespread progression (WSP) outcomes, and survival factors from a pooled data set of 1033 patients with OM treated with stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT).  Design, setting, and participants:   Case series from January 1, 2008, to December 31, 2016. The dates of analysis were April 2019 to May 2020. The setting was multi-institutional tertiary care hospitals. Participants were consecutive patients with 5 or fewer extracranial OMs whose primary tumor was treated curatively.  Exposure:   Definitive SBRT.  Main outcomes and measures:   Overall survival (OS), progression-free survival, rate of WSP, patterns of failure, and factors altering OS.  Results:   In the largest international OM case series to date (1033 participants) (mean age, 68.0 years [range, 18.0-94.3 years]; 601 [58.2%] men), 1416 SBRT courses were delivered to patients with 1 OM (596 [57.7%]), 2 OMs (245 [23.7%]), 3 OMs (105 [10.2%]), 4 OMs (55 [5.3%]), and 5 OMs (32 [3.1%]). The median follow-up was 24.1 months (range, 0.3-104.7 months), and the median OS was 44.2 months (95% CI, 39.2-48.8 months). The median PFS was 12.9 months (95% CI, 11.6-14.2 months), and the median time to WSP was 42.5 months (95% CI, 36.8-53.5 months). The OS rates were 84.1% (95% CI, 81.7%-86.2%) at 1 year, 56.7% (95% CI, 53.0%-60.2%) at 3 years, and 35.2% (95% CI, 30.1%-40.3%) at 5 years. The 3-year OS, PFS, and WSP rates were 56.7% (95% CI, 53.0%-60.2%), 23.0% (95% CI, 20.2%-25.9%), and 45.2% (95% CI, 41.4%-48.9%), respectively. The 5-year OS, PFS, and WSP rates were 35.2% (95% CI, 30.1%-40.3%), 14.8% (95% CI, 11.9%-17.9%), and 54.5% (95% CI, 49.8%-59.2%), respectively. At the time of first progression, 342 patients (33.1%) had recurrence of OM disease, and 230 patients (22.3%) underwent subsequent ablative therapies to all known metastatic sites.

Sixty-six (6.4%) grade 3 or higher toxic effects were observed, including 1 (0.1%) grade 5 event.  Conclusions and relevance:   This study found favorable long-term OS and WSP rates associated with extracranial OM ablated with SBRT; however, modest PFS rates were observed. A substantial proportion of patients with OM developed progressive disease and were treated with local ablation.

A unique synthetic approach is developed to make a series of functional nanoscale hybrid materials consisting of nucleobases (adenine and thymine) and phosphomolybdic acid (PMA) through solid state chemical reaction and self-assembly process. Adenine was protonated through its ring nitrogen, while the ketone group in thymine was protonated during the addition of PMA to these nucleobases. The self-assembled nanostructures formed as a result of the electrostatic interaction between the protonated nucleobases and polyanionic PMA. To promote the base pairing between the nucleobases, chloroaurate ions and silver ions were added to each PMA/adenine and PMA/thymine nanostructures. The complexation between the nucleobases and the added metal ions was found to drive the formation of subsequent self-assembled nanostructures. All the materials were screened for their anticancer activity against breast (MDAMB-231) and prostate (PC-3) cancer cells, and non-cancerous keratinocyte cells HaCaT.

The unique redox properties of these materials and the self-assembly of the PMA and metal ions were the major factors responsible for the cytotoxicity.

Here, we analyzed 17,747 prostate cancers by immunohistochemistry. Membranous and cytoplasmic CD138 staining was separately recorded. In normal prostate glands, CD138 staining was limited to basal cells. In cancers, membranous CD138 positivity was seen in 19.6% and cytoplasmic CD138 staining in 11.2% of 12,851 interpretable cases. A comparison with clinico-pathological features showed that cytoplasmic CD138 staining was more linked to unfavorable tumor features than membranous staining. Cytoplasmic CD138 immunostaining was associated with high tumor stage (p < 0.0001), high Gleason grade (p < 0.0001), nodal metastases (p < 0.0001), positive surgical margin (p < 0.0001), and biochemical recurrence (p < 0.0001). This also holds true for both V-ets avian erythroblastosis virus E26 oncogene homolog (ERG) fusion positive and ERG fusion negative tumors although the cytoplasmic CD138 expression was markedly more frequent in ERG positive than in ERG negative tumors (p < 0.0001). Comparison with 11 previously analyzed chromosomal deletions identified a conspicuous association between cytoplasmic CD138 expression and 8p deletions (p < 0.0001) suggesting a possible functional interaction of CD138 with one or several 8p genes. Multivariate analysis revealed the cytoplasmic CD138 expression as an independent prognostic parameter in all cancers and in the ERG positive subgroup.

Meanwhile, as an endogenous inhibitor of histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC 1), tumor-suppressive mammary serine protease inhibitor (maspin) was reported to sensitize drug-induced apoptosis with a better therapeutic outcome in CaP, but the relationship between AR and maspin remains unclear. In the current study, treatment of 5'-Aza or MS-275/enzalutamide induced poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) cleavage and p-H2A.X in CaP cells with an increase of maspin expression but a decrease of AR. Then, treatment with protease inhibitor MG132 did not rescue the above drug-induced loss of AR. In addition, modulation of maspin expression by gene recombinant or siRNA technology showed an inverse correlation between expression of maspin and AR, consequently affecting the AR-regulated downstream gene transcription (e.g., NKX3.1 and TMPRSS2). Bioinformatics analysis of the data extracted from the National Center for Biotechnology Information Gene Expression Omnibus (NCBI GEO) database also revealed an inverse correlation between low maspin expression and high AR level in advanced CaP. Furthermore, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay using anti-maspin antibody identified that a portion of AR promoter sequence was co-precipitated and presented in the immunoprecipitated complex. Finally, maspin-mediated repression of AR was induced by treatment of MS-275, which promoted enzalutamide treatment efficacy with decrease of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) expression in LNCaP and 22RV1 cells.

Indeed, PCa has proven problematic to establish as cell lines in culture due to its heterogeneity which remains a challenge, despite the various in vitro and in vivo model systems available. Growth factors have been shown to play a central role in the complex regulation of cell proliferation among hormone sensitive tumors, such as PCa.

We also assessed the role of epidermal growth factor (EGF) in culturing those cells. We profiled the AUB-PrC cells isolated from unaffected and tumor patient samples via depicting their molecular and epithelial lineage features through immunofluorescence staining and quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR), as well as through functional assays and transcriptomic profiling through RNA sequencing. In addition, by optimizing a previously established prostate organoids culture system, we were able to grow human prostate epithelial cells using growth medium and EGF only. With these data collected, we were able to gain insight at the molecular architecture of novel human AUB-PrC cells, which might pave the way for deciphering the mechanisms that lead to PCa development and progression, and ultimately improving prognostic abilities and treatments.""","""['Katia Cheaito', 'Hisham F Bahmad', 'Hiba Jalloul', 'Ola Hadadeh', 'Hiba Msheik', 'Albert El-Hajj', 'Deborah Mukherji', 'Mohamed Al-Sayegh', 'Wassim Abou-Kheir']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Front Cell Dev Biol""","""['Establishment and characterization of prostate organoids from treatment-naïve patients with prostate cancer.', 'A synopsis of prostate organoid methodologies, applications, and limitations.', 'Progress in prostate cancer study: 3D cell culture enables the ex vivo reproduction of tumor characteristics.', 'Epithelial and prostatic marker expression in short-term primary cultures of human prostate tissue samples.', 'Peptide growth factors in the prostate as mediators of stromal epithelial interaction.', 'Selecting Nanobodies Specific for the Epidermal Growth Factor from a Synthetic Nanobody Library.', 'Current status and clinical application of patient-derived tumor organoid model in kidney and prostate cancers.', 'Transcriptomic Signature and Growth Factor Regulation of Castration-Tolerant Prostate Luminal Progenitor Cells.', 'Establishment and characterization of prostate organoids from treatment-naïve patients with prostate cancer.', 'Application of Organoid Models in Prostate Cancer Research.']"""

This study aims to determine the clinical characteristics, prognosis, and temporal relationship of other cancers to lung cancer in these patients.  Methods:   This study retrospectively analyzed 3465 patients with dual primary cancers from the 5253 patients with LCSPM retrieved from the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) database from 2010 to 2015.  Results:   2285 eligible patients were further analyzed in this study cohort with 59.3% of 1-year OS, 34.7% of 3-year OS, and 25.2% of 5-year OS. The most common first primary cancer (FPC) in dual primary cancer patients with LCSPM was prostate cancer, followed by female breast cancer and urinary bladder cancer. In the entire study population, the median interval between the two primary malignancies was 21 months (range: 3.5-52 months). Age, sex, FPC location, surgery, stage, and histology of lung cancer were regarded as independent prognostic factors for these patients. The prognosis of patients with urinary bladder cancer as FPC was the worst in the univariate (p = 0.024) and multivariate (p < 0.001) Cox analyses. Lung cancer-directed surgery could significantly improve long-term survival (HR = 0.22, p < 0.001). Additionally, the C-index of the established nomogram with acceptable calibration curves was 0.760 (95% CI: 0.744-0.776) in the training cohort and was 0.759 (95% CI: 0.737-0.781) in the validation cohort, showing an ideal model discrimination ability. The corresponding decision curve analysis (DCA) indicated the nomogram had relatively ideal clinical utility.  Conclusions:   Cancer patients still have the risk of developing a new primary lung cancer. Close, lifelong follow-up is recommended for all these patients. Early detection for surgical treatment will significantly improve the prognosis of dual primary cancer patients with LCSPM. The nomogram developed to predict 1-, 3-, and 5-year OS rates has relatively good performance.""","""['Congkuan Song', 'Donghu Yu', 'Yujin Wang', 'Qingwen Wang', 'Zixin Guo', 'Jingyu Huang', 'Sheng Li', 'Weidong Hu']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Front Oncol""","""['Prognostic Factors Analysis and Nomogram Construction of Dual Primary Lung Cancer: A Population Study.', 'Construction and Validation of a Novel Nomogram to Predict the Overall Survival of Patients With Combined Small Cell Lung Cancer: A Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Population-Based Study.', 'Development and validation of a prognostic nomogram for predicting overall survival in patients with primary bladder sarcoma: a SEER-based retrospective study.', 'Prognostic nomogram for patients with lung metastatic renal cell carcinoma: a SEER-based study.', 'Clinical characteristics and prostate-cancer-specific mortality of competitive risk nomogram in the second primary prostate cancer.', 'Risk Factors and Pathogenic Mechanism for Secondary Primary Lung Cancer \u2029in Breast Cancer Patients: A Review.', 'Analysis of prognosis and treatment decisions for patients with second primary lung cancer following esophageal cancer.', 'Development and Validation of a Nomogram for Predicting Overall Survival in Patients with Second Primary Small Cell Lung Cancer After Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer: A SEER-Based Study.', 'Second Primary Lung Adenocarcinoma After Intensity-Modulated Radiotherapy for Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma.', 'Pathological and clinical features of multiple cancers and lung adenocarcinoma: a multicentre study.']"""

Using data from the 1000Genomes project, we estimated the size of the lactase persistence haplotype block to be 1.9 Mbp containing up to 9 protein-coding genes and a microRNA. Based on the function of the genes and microRNA, we studied health phenotypes likely to be impacted by the lactase persistence allele: prostate cancer status, cardiovascular disease status, and bone mineral density. We used summary statistics from large genome-wide metanalyses-32,965 bone mineral density, 140,306 prostate cancer and 184,305 coronary artery disease subjects-to evaluate whether the lactase persistence allele was associated with these disease phenotypes.

We started our cryotherapy program in 2008 for selected patients with localized PC. Our objective is to evaluate the oncologic and functional outcomes of primary cryotherapy in men with clinically localized PC.  Subjects and methods:   We retrospectively evaluated all patients who underwent primary cryotherapy for localized PC treatment at our center between January 2008 and December 2017. In order to downsize prostates between 40 and 60cc neoadjuvant 3-month hormonal therapy was administered. Primary endpoint was biochemical progression-free survival (BPFS) rate as defined by the Phoenix criteria. Secondary endpoints were cancer-specific survival (CSS), overall survival (OS), patient reported functional outcomes and complication rates. Factors influencing de BPFS were evaluated individually using Kaplan-Meyer and Cox regression models and in a multivariate model using Cox regression.  Results:   During the mentioned period, a total of 177 men were treated with cryotherapy. With a mean follow-up of 60 months (SD 32.9), the Kaplan-Meier analysis shows an overall BPFS rate was 67%. BPFS by risk group was 70.2%, 70.3% and 50.0% for the low, intermediate and high risk groups, respectively (p = 0.925). Overall time to BR was 93.67 months (SD 2.84, IC95%: 88.10-99.24): 95.91 (SD 3,44), 93.23 (SD 4.81) and 89.77 (SD 6.67) months for the low, intermediate and high risk groups, respectively. In both univariate and multivariate analysis, the only predictor of biochemical progression was de PSA nadir (HR 1.56 IC95%: 1.50-1.63). Continence was fully maintained in 95% of patients after the procedure. Postoperative complications included UTI (17.5%), hematuria (9.6%), perineal hematoma (11%) and postoperative pain (4.5%). No fistulas were reported. 8.5% of patients had acute urinary retention solved conservatively.

A total of 134 CNPC patients who were ≥65 years of age without bone metastases were registered in this study. DISH was found in 36.6% (49/134) of the patients in the study population. Patients with DISH were significantly older and had a lower total hip-bone mineral density (BMD) than those without DISH. On the other hand, there were no significant differences in fat distribution, prevalence of hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes, fasting plasma glucose (FPG), hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c, prostate-specific antigen (PSA), or lumbar-BMD (L-BMD). A multivariate analysis of age, DISH, body mass index (BMI), visceral fat area (VFA), and total hip-BMD, which were significantly associated with PVF in a univariate analysis, showed that age (OR 1.11; p = .02) and DISH (OR 5.99; p = .0003) were independently associated with PVF.

Materials and methods:   Transperineal laser ablation (TPLA) was performed under the guidance of transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) in eight canines. Two canines were sacrificed 1 day and 1 week after TPLA, respectively. The remaining six canines were sacrificed after finishing transrectal contrast-enhanced ultrasound (TR-CEUS) at three phases.  Results:   The prostatic volumes immediately following TPLA and 1 week later were larger than before TPLA (20.1 ± 3.9 vs 17.1 ± 3.8 ml; 21.7 ± 3.6 vs 17.1 ± 3.8 ml, p < 0.05), but 1 month later, returned to the preoperative level (17.4 ± 3.2 ml).

The mean volumes of laser-ablated lesions increased significantly over time after TPLA (p < 0.050).  Conclusion:   The prostate volume transient enlarges after TPLA, which prompts for clinical application that it should prolong appropriately the duration of urinary catheterization to avoid acute urinary retention.

Participants:   403 men diagnosed with prostate cancer and completed at least one questionnaire immediately before and at 1 or 3 months after radical prostatectomy.  Primary and secondary outcomes:   STAR instrument before surgery and 1 and 3 months afterwards.  Results:   Neither scale fitted the Rasch model (both scales p<0.001). Both urinary (seven items) and sexual function (six items) had disordered thresholds, suggesting response categories are not working as intended. Both scales (three urinary items; five sexual function items) showed problems with item fit (large fit residuals, significant χ2, an inspection of item characteristic curves). Both scales showed items that were unstable over time (differential item functioning (DIF) by time). Both scales (four pairs of items in each scale) showed local response dependency (residual correlations >0.2 above the average). Internal consistency was acceptable at the group level for both scales. Targeting was poor for both scales, indicating an inadequate match between the location of items and the distribution of the patients, suggesting that the underlying constructs that the scales purport to measure are not clear.  Conclusion:   Using Rasch analysis as a diagnostic tool, we identified that both the urinary and the sexual function scales have issues that need to be resolved before STAR can be used with confidence in clinical practice.

However, in previous studies, individuals with blunted parathyroid hormone (PTH) response to vitamin D insufficiency/deficiency (BPRVID), were not differentiated from those with high PTH response to vitamin D insufficiency/deficiency (HPRVID). Individuals with BPRVID are responsive to magnesium treatment, particularly treatment of magnesium plus vitamin D while those with HPRVID are responsive to vitamin D treatment. We prospectively compared these two distinct groups (i.e. BPRVID and HPRVID) for risk of incident adenoma, metachronous adenoma, and incident colorectal cancer (CRC) METHODS: Three nested case-control studies in the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian Cancer (PLCO) Screening Trial.  Results:   We found optimal 25(OH)D levels were associated with a significantly reduced risk of CRC, primarily among women. The associations between 25(OH)D and CRC risk significantly differed by PTH levels, particularly among women. Compared to individuals with optimal levels for both 25(OH)D and PTH, all others were at an elevated risk of incident CRC, primarily in women. We found those with BPRVID had 2.56-fold significantly increased risk of CRC compared to 1.65-fold non-significantly increased risk for those with HPRVID. Among women, we observed those with BPRVID had 4.79-6.25-fold significantly increased risks of incident CRC and adenoma whereas those with HPRVID had 3.65-fold significantly increased risk of CRC.

Enzymatic activities of compounds were conducted by using HPLC analysis to investigate the interaction of substrates with Ssap-NtrB nitroreductase enzyme. MTT assay was performed to evaluate the toxic effect of compounds against Hep3B and PC3 cancer cell lines and healthy HUVEC cell. It was observed that synthesized compounds NHN1-16 exhibited different cytotoxic profiles. Pyrimidine derivative NHN3 and triazine derivative NHN5 can be good drug candidates for prostate cancer with IC50 values of 54.75 µM and 48.9 µM, respectively.

This study was undertaken to describe the clinicopathological spectrum of PTTs received over a 20-year period.  Methods:   All primary and secondary PTTs diagnosed from 2000 to 2019 in the pathology department of a tertiary care hospital in North India were retrospectively reviewed. Gross, histopathological features and immunohistochemistry (IHC) findings were correlated with clinical details.  Results:   A total of 169 intra-scrotal tumors were diagnosed during the study period, out of which there were 30 PTTs (in 27 patients) comprising 17.75%. Age range was 4 to 85 years (median 58 years). Benign PTTs were the commonest (n = 21, 70%), followed by metastasis to the paratesticular region (n = 6, 20%) and then primary malignant PTTs (n = 3, 10%). The commonest benign PTT was lipoma (n = 16, 76.19%), followed by adenomatoid tumor (n = 3, 14.28%) with one case each (4.76%) of cellular angiofibroma and hemangioma. Among primary malignant PTT, there were two cases of rhabdomyosarcoma, and one case of biphasic malignant mesothelioma.

We have recently proposed the use of metabolically stabilized GRPR antagonist BBN2 for radiolabeling with 18F and 68Ga and subsequent PET imaging of GRPRs in prostate cancer. The present work studied the impact of 44gSc- and 68Ga-labeled DOTA complexes attached to GRPR antagonist BBN2 on the in vitro GRPR binding affinity, and their biodistribution and tumor uptake profiles in MCF7 breast and PC3 prostate cancer models.  Methods:   DOTA-Ava-BBN2 was radiolabeled with radiometals 68Ga and 44gSc. Gastrin-releasing peptide receptor (GRPR) affinities of peptides were assessed in PC3 prostate cancer cells. GRPR expression profiles were studied in human breast cancer tissue samples and MCF7 breast cancer cells. PET imaging of 68Ga- and 44gSc-labeled peptides was performed in MCF7 and PC3 xenografts as breast and prostate cancer models.  Results:   Radiopeptides [68Ga]Ga-DOTA-Ava-BBN2 and [44gSc]Sc-DOTA-Ava BBN2 were prepared in radiochemical yields of 70-80% (decay-corrected), respectively. High binding affinities were found for both peptides (IC50 = 15 nM (natGa) and 5 nM (natSc)). Gene expression microarray analysis revealed high GRPR mRNA expression levels in estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer, which was further confirmed with Western blot and immunohistochemistry. However, PET imaging showed only low tumor uptake of both radiotracers in MCF7 xenografts ([68Ga]Ga-DOTA-BBN2 (SUV60min 0.27 ± 0.06); [44gSc]Sc-DOTA-BBN2 (SUV60min 0.20 ± 0.03)). In contrast, high tumor uptake and retention were found for both radiopeptides in PC3 tumors ([68Ga]Ga-DOTA-BBN2 (SUV60min 0.46 ± 0.07); [44gSc]Sc-DOTA-BBN2 (SUV60min 0.51 ± 0.11)).  Conclusions:   Comparison of 68Ga- and 44gSc-labeled DOTA-Ava-BBN2 peptides revealed slight but noticeable differences of the radiometal with an impact on the in vitro GRPR receptor binding properties in PC3 cells. No differences were found in their in vivo biodistribution profiles in MCF7 and PC3 xenografts. Radiopeptides [68Ga]Ga-DOTA-Ava-BBN2 and [44gSc]Sc-DOTA-Ava-BBN2 displayed comparable tumor uptake and retention profiles with rapid blood and renal clearance profiles in both tumor models.  Advances in knowledge and implications for patient care:   The favorable PET imaging performance of [44gSc]Sc-DOTA-Ava-BBN2 in prostate cancer should warrant the development of an [43Sc]Sc-DOTA-Ava-BBN2 analog for clinical translation which comes with a main γ-line of much lower energy and intensity compared to 44gSc.""","""['Simon Ferguson', 'Melinda Wuest', 'Susan Richter', 'Cody Bergman', 'Jennifer Dufour', 'Daniel Krys', 'Jennifer Simone', 'Hans-Sonke Jans', 'Terence Riauka', 'Frank Wuest']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Nucl Med Biol""","""['Metabolically Stabilized (68)Ga-NOTA-Bombesin for PET Imaging of Prostate Cancer and Influence of Protease Inhibitor Phosphoramidon.', 'Dual-Modality Imaging of Prostate Cancer with a Fluorescent and Radiogallium-Labeled Gastrin-Releasing Peptide Receptor Antagonist.', 'Preclinical comparison of Al18F- and 68Ga-labeled gastrin-releasing peptide receptor antagonists for PET imaging of prostate cancer.', '99mTc(v)O-Gly-Gly-Cys-Orn-Orn-Orn-Bombesin2-14.', '99mTc-labeled N40,Pro1,Tyr4bombesin.', 'Peptide-based positron emission tomography probes: current strategies for synthesis and radiolabelling.', 'Radiolabeled Bombesin Analogs.', 'MRI/PET Imaging in elevated PSA and localized prostate cancer: a narrative review.', 'Recent Advances in the Clinical Translation of Silicon Fluoride Acceptor (SiFA) 18F-Radiopharmaceuticals.', 'Production of scandium radionuclides for theranostic applications: towards standardization of quality requirements.']"""

Here, we evaluated the effect of aerobic exercise in a model of BPH using obese mice.  Methods:   Obese C57BL/6J mice in the control group, obesity group (OB), and obesity group plus exercise (OB + E) with eight weeks training were inspected for morphological alterations via hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) staining, lipid and sex hormone metabolites via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs), relative protein expression via Western blotting, and prostate cancer-up-regulated long noncoding RNA (PlncRNA) and androgen receptor (AR) mRNA levels via quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR).  Results:   Aerobic exercise training slowed fat-mass gain in OB mice. Prostate volume (PV) and area of lumen was significantly decreased in OB mice and was slightly increased following aerobic exercise. Epithelial volume density in the OB group was higher than that in the control group. Furthermore, aerobic exercise lowered serum low-density lipoprotein (LDL), triglyceride, and free fatty acid (FFA) levels, whereas it raised high-density lipoprotein (HDL) levels in OB + E mice. Additionally, the hormonal ratio of estradiol/testosterone (E2/T) approached that of the control group following aerobic exercise in OB + E mice. Mechanistically, aerobic exercise downregulated the PlncRNA-AR/androgen signaling pathway via the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/protein kinase B (PI3K/AKT) axis in the prostates of OB + E mice.

Methods:   We identified 3789 White men who underwent RP between 1988 and 2017 in the Shared Equal Access Regional Cancer Hospital database. Men were categorized as Hispanic or non-Hispanic. Logistic regression was used to test the association between ethnicity and PC adverse features. Cox models were used to test the association between ethnicity and biochemical recurrence (BCR), metastases, and castration-resistant PC (CRPC). All models were adjusted for age, prostate-specific antigen, clinical stage, biopsy grade group, surgery year, and surgical center.  Results:   Of 3789 White men, 236 (6%) were Hispanic. Hispanic men had higher prostate-specific antigen, but all other characteristics were similar between ethnicities. On multivariable analysis, there was no difference between ethnicities in odds of extracapsular extension, seminal vesicle invasion, positive margins, positive lymph nodes, or high-grade disease (odds ratio 0.62-0.89, all P > .07).

Gene expression patterns were analyzed in 21 samples from 7 localized, 6 locally advanced, and 8 metastatic PCa patients using Illumina microarrays. Expression levels of 41 genes were validated by quantitative PCR in 101 independent PCa patients who underwent radical prostatectomy. Logistic regression analysis was used to identify individual predictors of BCR. A risk score for predicting BCR including clinicopathological and gene expression variables was developed.

Methods:   Our model is based on DenseNet and consists of two 2D input channels and one 2D output channel. These three types of data comprise dose distributions without a magnetic field (uncorrected), electron density (ED) maps, and dose distributions with a magnetic field. These data were generated as follows: both types of dose distributions were created using 15-field IMRT in the same conditions except for the presence or absence of a magnetic field with the GPU Monte Carlo dose in Monaco version 5.4; ED maps were acquired with planning CT images using a clinical CT-to-ED table at our institution. Data for 50 prostate cancer patients were used; 30 patients were allocated for training, 10 for validation, and 10 for testing using 4-fold cross-validation based on rectum gas volume. The accuracy of the model was evaluated by comparing 2D gamma-indexes against the dose distributions in each irradiation field with a magnetic field (true).  Results:   The gamma indexes in the body for CNN-corrected uncorrected dose against the true dose were 94.95% ± 4.69% and 63.19% ± 3.63%, respectively.

Methods:18F-rhPSMA-7 PET/CT scans of patients with BCR between July 2017 and June 2018 were retrospectively reviewed. All suspicious lesions were recorded. The reference standard was histopathology or combinations of histopathology, imaging, or prostate-specific antigen (PSA) follow up, defined as composite reference standard. DR was calculated as the proportion of PSMA PET-positive patients to all patients independent of the reference standard, whereas the CDR was the percentage of patients who had at least 1 true-positive PSMA PET lesion localized that corresponded with the reference standard. The PPV was defined as the proportion of patients who had true-positive to all positive findings. The correlation between DR and patient characteristics was evaluated. Results: A total of 532 patients with a median PSA level of 0.97 ng/mL (interquartile range: 0.41-2.46 ng/mL) were included. Of these, 162 patients had composite follow-up at a median duration of 5.6 mo (range: 1.1-14.2 mo). The proportion of patients who had no lesion visualized on PET/CT, localized disease, and any distant metastases (M1) were 20%, 43%, and 37%, respectively. PET DR among all patients was 80%. On a per-patient basis, the PPV of 18F-rhPSMA-7 PET/CT in the composite cohort was 88%, and the CDR was 70%. The PPV in the histopathology-proven cohort was 91%, and the CDR in this subgroup was 73%. In patients with PSA levels ≥ 1 ng/mL the DR and PPV were 90% and 91%, respectively, resulting in a CDR of 82%. In patients with PSA levels < 1 ng/mL, the DR and PPV were 69% and 85%, respectively, resulting in a CDR of 59%. There was a significant positive correlation between 18F-rhPSMA-7 PET/CT detection efficacy and stratified PSA levels (P = 0.005), as well as PSA nadir after prostatectomy (P < 0.001).

Therapeutic options are limited for AR-independent castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), and defining mechanisms critical for survival is of utmost importance for targeting this lethal disease. Our studies focus on identifying telomere maintenance mechanism (TMM) hallmarks adopted by CRPC to promote survival. TMMs are responsible for telomere elongation to instill replicative immortality and prevent senescence, with the two TMM pathways available being telomerase and alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT). Here, we show that AR-independent CRPC demonstrates an atypical ALT-like phenotype with variable telomerase expression and activity, whereas AR-dependent models lack discernible ALT hallmarks. In addition, AR-independent CRPC cells exhibited elevated levels of SLX4IP, a protein implicated in promoting ALT. SLX4IP overexpression in AR-dependent C4-2B cells promoted an ALT-like phenotype and telomere maintenance. SLX4IP knockdown in AR-independent DU145 and PC-3 cells led to ALT-like hallmark reduction, telomere shortening, and induction of senescence. In PC-3 xenografts, this effect translated to reduced tumor volume. Using an in vitro model of AR-independent progression, loss of AR in AR-dependent C4-2B cells promoted an atypical ALT-like phenotype in an SLX4IP-dependent manner. Insufficient SLX4IP expression diminished ALT-like hallmarks and resulted in accelerated telomere loss and senescence. IMPLICATIONS: This study demonstrates a unique reliance of AR-independent CRPC on SLX4IP-mediated ALT-like hallmarks and loss of these hallmarks induces telomere shortening and senescence, thereby impairing replicative immortality.""","""['Tawna L Mangosh', 'Wisam N Awadallah', 'Magdalena M Grabowska', 'Derek J Taylor']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Mol Cancer Res""","""['SLX4IP N-terminus dictates telomeric localization in ALT-like castration-resistant prostate cancer cell lines.', 'SLX4IP Antagonizes Promiscuous BLM Activity during ALT Maintenance.', 'SLX4IP and telomere dynamics dictate breast cancer metastasis and therapeutic responsiveness.', 'Androgen receptor-dependent and -independent mechanisms driving prostate cancer progression: Opportunities for therapeutic targeting from multiple angles.', 'Androgen receptor: what we know and what we expect in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'SLX4IP N-terminus dictates telomeric localization in ALT-like castration-resistant prostate cancer cell lines.', 'TRIMming Down Hormone-Driven Cancers: The Biological Impact of TRIM Proteins on Tumor Development, Progression and Prognostication.', 'SLX4IP promotes RAP1 SUMOylation by PIAS1 to coordinate telomere maintenance through NF-κB and Notch signaling.']"""

Methods:   We used U.S. national death certificate data. A total of 45 categories of common cancers were grouped for cancer-specific calculations of PYLL and PYLL per death. PYLL was defined as the sum of the total years of life lost prior to age 75 years.  Results:   The largest number of PYLL in 2017 was due to deaths from cancers of the lung/bronchus (891,313; 20.8%), colon/rectum (409,538; 9.6%), and breast (400,643; 9.4%). Cancers with the highest PYLLs generally also caused the largest number of deaths and had the highest mortality rates, with the exception of prostate cancer (5.1% of deaths, 2.0% of PYLL). In contrast, PYLLs per death were greatest for deaths due to cancers of testis (mean = 34.0 years), bones/joints (26.4), and other endocrine sites including thymus (25.2).  Conclusions:   Although PYLLs generally reflect mortality rates, they more heavily weigh cancers that occur at younger ages. In contrast, PYLL per death, which is an average quantification of life years lost for individual patients with cancer, shows a different pattern.

We aimed to investigate them among patients with prostate cancer treated by various modalities.  Methods:   Using a nationwide population-based database, we calculated 5-year CRS conditioned on 1 through 5 years survival after diagnosis. These rates were stratified by age, sex, socioeconomic status, comorbidities, and treatment received. Cause of death and estimated cause-specific mortality were also described and considered with competing risks.  Results:   A total of 81,773 patients newly diagnosed with primary prostate cancer from 2007 to 2013 were identified. The 5-year CRS was 81.1% at baseline, but increased gradually up to 95.4% at 4 years and exceeded 100% at 5 years after diagnosis, suggesting no excess mortality compared with the general population. However, this pattern differed by treatment received. Patients who underwent androgen deprivation therapy showed 5-year CRS of only 88.4% at 5 years after diagnosis, implying persistent excess mortality. Prostate cancer constituted around one-third of deaths, while other cancers were the main cause of death within <2 years after diagnosis. Noncancer-related deaths, including cardiovascular disease and respiratory disease, increased with time since diagnosis.  Conclusions:   CRS rates for patients with prostate cancer improved over time and exceeded that of the general population at 5 years.

Here, we compare the agreement between lesion segmentations by U-Net with manual lesion segmentations performed by different radiologists.  Materials and methods:   165 patients with suspicion for sPC underwent targeted and systematic fusion biopsy following 3 Tesla multiparametric MRI (mpMRI). Five sets of segmentations were generated retrospectively: segmentations of clinical lesions, independent segmentations by three radiologists, and fully automated bi-parametric U-Net segmentations. Per-lesion agreement was calculated for each rater by averaging Dice coefficients with all overlapping lesions from other raters. Agreement was compared using descriptive statistics and linear mixed models.  Results:   The mean Dice coefficient for manual segmentations showed only moderate agreement at 0.48-0.52, reflecting the difficult visual task of determining the outline of otherwise jointly detected lesions. U-net segmentations were significantly smaller than manual segmentations (p < 0.0001) and exhibited a lower mean Dice coefficient of 0.22, which was significantly lower compared to manual segmentations (all p < 0.0001). These differences remained after correction for lesion size and were unaffected between sPC and non-sPC lesions and between peripheral and transition zone lesions.  Conclusion:   Knowledge of the order of agreement of manual segmentations of different radiologists is important to set the expectation value for artificial intelligence (AI) systems in the task of prostate MRI lesion segmentation. Perfect agreement (Dice coefficient of one) should not be expected for AI. Lower Dice coefficients of U-Net compared to manual segmentations are only partially explained by smaller segmentation sizes and may result from a focus on the lesion core and a small relative lesion center shift. Although it is primarily important that AI detects sPC correctly, the Dice coefficient for overlapping lesions from multiple raters can be used as a secondary measure for segmentation quality in future studies.  Key points:   · Intermediate human Dice coefficients reflect the difficulty of outlining jointly detected lesions.. · Lower Dice coefficients of deep learning motivate further research to approximate human perception.. · Comparable predictive performance of deep learning appears independent of Dice agreement.. · Dice agreement independent of significant cancer presence indicates indistinguishability of some benign imaging findings.. · Improving DWI to T2 registration may improve the observed U-Net Dice coefficients..

Animal models have shown that formalin- and bacterial-induced prostatic inflammation can induce bladder dysfunction; however, the underlying mechanisms contributing to prostatic inflammation in BPH and bladder dysfunction are not clear. We previously reported that E-cadherin expression in BPH is downregulated in hyperplastic nodules compared with expression in adjacent normal tissues. Here, we explored the potential consequences of prostatic E-cadherin downregulation on the prostate and bladder in vivo using an inducible murine model of prostate luminal epithelial-specific deletion of Cdh1. The prostate-specific antigen (PSA)-CreERT2 transgenic mouse strain expressing tamoxifen-inducible CreERT2 recombinase driven by a 6-kb human PSA promoter/enhancer was crossed with the B6.129-Cdh1tm2Kem/J mouse to generate bigenic PSA-CreERT2/Cdh1-/- mice. Deletion of E-cadherin was induced by transient administration of tamoxifen when mice reached sexual maturity (7 weeks of age). At 21 to 23 weeks of age, the prostate, bladder, and prostatic urethra were examined histologically, and bladder function was assessed using void spot assays and cystometry. Mice with Cdh1 deletion had increased prostatic inflammation, prostatic epithelial hyperplasia, and stromal changes at 21 to 23 weeks of age, as well as changes in bladder voiding function compared with age-matched controls. Thus, loss of E-cadherin in the murine prostate could result in prostatic defects that are characteristic of BPH and LUTS, suggesting that E-cadherin downregulation could be a driving force in human BPH development and progression.""","""['Laura E Pascal', 'Shinsuke Mizoguchi', 'Wei Chen', 'Lora H Rigatti', 'Taro Igarashi', 'Rajiv Dhir', 'Pradeep Tyagi', 'Zeyu Wu', 'Zhenyu Yang', 'William C de Groat', 'Donald B DeFranco', 'Naoki Yoshimura', 'Zhou Wang']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Endocrinology""","""['E-cadherin deficiency promotes prostate macrophage inflammation and bladder overactivity in aged male mice.', 'Bladder overactivity and afferent hyperexcitability induced by prostate-to-bladder cross-sensitization in rats with prostatic inflammation.', 'E-cadherin is downregulated in benign prostatic hyperplasia and required for tight junction formation and permeability barrier in the prostatic epithelial cell monolayer.', 'The role of inflammation in lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) due to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and its potential impact on medical therapy.', 'The role of chronic prostatic inflammation in the pathogenesis and progression of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH).', 'The Emerging Role of Cell Adhesion Molecules on Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia.', 'Decoding the Key Functional Combined Components Group and Uncovering the Molecular Mechanism of Longdan Xiegan Decoction in Treating Uveitis.', 'Urinary and sexual function changes in benign prostatic hyperplasia patients before and after transurethral columnar balloon dilatation of the prostate.', 'Applications of Vertebrate Models in Studying Prostatitis and Inflammation-Associated Prostatic Diseases.', 'E-cadherin deficiency promotes prostate macrophage inflammation and bladder overactivity in aged male mice.']"""

Cox proportional hazards regression, stratified by sex and comorbidities and adjusted for age, was performed to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) for the risk of subsequent RCC. Among 2,232,092 subjects, patients who received alpha-1 blocker treatment had a higher risk of RCC than the unexposed group. Taking into account hypertension and BPH, the adjusted HR was significantly higher in male alpha-1 blocker users who had no BPH and either the presence (HR: 1.63, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.22-2.18) or absence (HR: 2.31, 95% CI = 1.40-3.81) of hypertension than in men not receiving these drugs. Taken together, male alpha-1 blocker users who had no comorbidity of BPH exhibited an increased risk for developing RCC independent of hypertension.

Methods:   Thirty-eight patients who underwent a clinically indicated bladder mp-MRI on a 3-T scanner were prospectively enrolled. Trans-urethral resection of bladder was the gold standard. Two sets of images, set 1 (bp-MRI) and set 2 (mp-MRI), were independently reviewed by four readers. Descriptive statistics, including sensitivity and specificity, were calculated for each reader. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was performed, and the areas under the curve (AUCs) were calculated for the bp-MRI and the standard mp-MRI. Pairwise comparison of the ROC curves was performed.  Results:   The AUCs for bp- and mp-MRI were respectively 0.91-0.92 (reader 1), 0.90 (reader 2), 0.95-0.90 (reader 3), and 0.90-0.87 (reader 4). Sensitivity was 100% for both protocols and specificity ranged between 79.31 and 89.66% and between 79.31 and 83.33% for bp-MRI and mp-MRI, respectively. No significant differences were shown between the two MRI protocols (p > 0.05). No significant differences were shown accordingly to the reader's experience (p > 0.05).  Conclusions:   A bp-MRI protocol consisting of T2W and DWI has comparable diagnostic accuracy to the standard mp-MRI protocol for the detection of muscle-invasive bladder cancer. The experience of the reader does not significantly affect the diagnostic performance using VI-RADS.  Key points:   • The contrast-free MRI protocol shows a comparable accuracy to the standard multiparametric MRI protocol in the bladder cancer muscle-invasiveness assessment. • VI-RADS classification helps non-expert radiologists to assess the muscle-invasiveness of bladder cancer. • DCE should be carefully interpreted by less experienced readers due to inflammatory changes representing a potential pitfall.""","""['Andrea Delli Pizzi', 'Domenico Mastrodicasa', 'Michele Marchioni', 'Giulia Primiceri', 'Francesca Di Fabio', 'Roberta Cianci', 'Barbara Seccia', 'Barbara Sessa', 'Erica Mincuzzi', 'Martina Romanelli', 'Pietro Castellan', 'Roberto Castellucci', 'Antonella Colasante', 'Luigi Schips', 'Raffaella Basilico', 'Massimo Caulo']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Eur Radiol""","""['Comparison of the diagnostic accuracy and validity of biparametric MRI and multiparametric MRI-based VI-RADS scoring in bladder cancer; is contrast material really necessary in detecting muscle invasion?', 'Diagnostic accuracy and discriminative power of biparametric versus multiparametric MRI in predicting muscle-invasive bladder cancer.', 'Conspicuity and muscle-invasiveness assessment for bladder cancer using VI-RADS: a multi-reader, contrast-free MRI study to determine optimal b-values for diffusion-weighted imaging.', 'Biparametric magnetic resonance imaging assessment for detection of muscle-invasive bladder cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Multiparametric MRI in detection and staging of prostate cancer.', 'Evaluation of Whole-Tumor Texture Analysis Based on MRI Diffusion Kurtosis and Biparametric VI-RADS Model for Staging and Grading Bladder Cancer.', 'A machine learning model based on MRI for the preoperative prediction of bladder cancer invasion depth.', 'Predicting lymphovascular invasion in rectal cancer: evaluating the performance of golden-angle radial sparse parallel MRI for rectal perfusion assessment.', 'Novel utility of Vesical Imaging-Reporting and Data System in multimodal treatment for muscle-invasive bladder cancer.', 'Accuracy of actual stage prediction using Vesical Imaging Reporting and Data System (VI-RADS) before radical cystectomy for urothelial carcinoma in SUPER-UC-Cx.']"""

Aims: To elucidate the role of LOY in various cancer types, namely, prostate (PRT), pancreatic (PC), and colorectal (CRC) cancers in males. Material and Methods: Fifty CRC patients [mean age = 44.58±11.2 years], fifty PRT [mean age= 60.48± 17.07 years] and fifty PC [mean age = 48.74 ±16.45 years] along with 100 healthy controls [mean age= 54.06 ±15.04 years] were recruited. DNA was isolated from peripheral blood and was subjected to multiplex QF-PCR. The Y/X ratio was calculated from the peak height. Results: The mean Y/X ratio was lower in all patients with cancers (0.875333± 0.086; p value˂ 0.0001) than in controls (1.11 ± 0.071), as well as, in CRC (0.926±0.192; p value˂0.0001), PC (0.85 ± 0.0311; p value˂0.0001) and PRT (0.85±0.122; p value˂0.0001) when calculated separately. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to analyze the strength of the presence of cancer prediction using the percentage of LOY and age showed that LOY (p= 0.001) is a better predictor of cancer presence than age (p= 0.359).

In addition to setup uncertainties, proton therapy is affected by uncertainties in proton range and relative biological effectiveness (RBE). While to date a constant RBE of 1.1 is commonly assumed, the actual RBE is known to increase toward the distal end of the spread-out Bragg peak. Several models for variable RBE predictions exist. We present a framework to evaluate the combined impact and interactions of setup, range, and RBE uncertainties in a comprehensive, variance-based sensitivity analysis (SA).  Material and methods:   The variance-based SA requires a large number (104 -105 ) of RBE-weighted dose (RWD) calculations. Based on a particle therapy extension of the research treatment planning system CERR we implemented a fast, graphics processing unit (GPU) accelerated pencil beam modeling of patient and range shifts. For RBE predictions, two biological models were included: The mechanistic repair-misrepair-fixation (RMF) model and the phenomenological Wedenberg model. All input parameters (patient position, proton range, RBE model parameters) are sampled simultaneously within their assumed probability distributions. Statistical formalisms rank the input parameters according to their influence on the overall uncertainty of RBE-weighted dose-volume histogram (RW-DVH) quantiles and the RWD in every voxel, resulting in relative, normalized sensitivity indices (S = 0: noninfluential input, S = 1: only influential input). Results are visualized as RW-DVHs with error bars and sensitivity maps.  Results and conclusions:   The approach is demonstrated for two representative brain tumor cases and a prostate case. The full SA including ∼ 3 × 10 4 RWD calculations took 39, 11, and 55 min, respectively. Range uncertainty was an important contribution to overall uncertainty at the distal end of the target, while the relatively smaller uncertainty inside the target was governed by biological uncertainties. Consequently, the uncertainty of the RW-DVH quantile D98 for the target was governed by range uncertainty while the uncertainty of the mean target dose was dominated by the biological parameters. The SA framework is a powerful and flexible tool to evaluate uncertainty in RWD distributions and DVH quantiles, taking into account physical and RBE uncertainties and their interactions. The additional information might help to prioritize research efforts to reduce physical and RBE uncertainties and could also have implications for future approaches to biologically robust planning and optimization.""","""['Jan Hofmaier', 'George Dedes', 'David J Carlson', 'Katia Parodi', 'Claus Belka', 'Florian Kamp']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Application of variance-based uncertainty and sensitivity analysis to biological modeling in carbon ion treatment plans.', 'Fast Biological Modeling for Voxel-based Heavy Ion Treatment Planning Using the Mechanistic Repair-Misrepair-Fixation Model and Nuclear Fragment Spectra.', 'Quantification of the uncertainties of a biological model and their impact on variable RBE proton treatment plan optimization.', 'Proton therapy - Present and future.', 'Relative Biological Effectiveness Uncertainties and Implications for Beam Arrangements and Dose Constraints in Proton Therapy.', 'Towards an integral clinical proton dose prediction uncertainty by considering delineation variation.', 'Combining inter-observer variability, range and setup uncertainty in a variance-based sensitivity analysis for proton therapy.']"""

However, intraprostatic lesions may be missed by visual PSMA-PET interpretation. In this work, we quantified and characterized the intraprostatic lesions which have been missed by visual PSMA-PET image interpretation. In addition, we investigated whether PSMA-PET-derived radiomics features (RFs) could detect these lesions.  Methodology:   This study consists of two cohorts of primary PCa patients: a prospective training cohort (n = 20) and an external validation cohort (n = 52). All patients underwent 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT and histology sections were obtained after surgery. PCa lesions missed by visual PET image interpretation were counted and their International Society of Urological Pathology score (ISUP) was obtained. Finally, 154 RFs were derived from the PET images and the discriminative power to differentiate between prostates with or without visually undetectable lesions was assessed and areas under the receiver-operating curve (ROC-AUC) as well as sensitivities/specificities were calculated.  Results:   In the training cohort, visual PET image interpretation missed 134 tumor lesions in 60% (12/20) of the patients, and of these patients, 75% had clinically significant (ISUP > 1) PCa. The median diameter of the missed lesions was 2.2 mm (range: 1-6). Standard clinical parameters like the NCCN risk group were equally distributed between patients with and without visually missed lesions (p < 0.05). Two RFs (local binary pattern (LBP) size-zone non-uniformality normalized and LBP small-area emphasis) were found to perform excellently in visually unknown PCa detection (Mann-Whitney U: p < 0.01, ROC-AUC: ≥ 0.93). In the validation cohort, PCa was missed in 50% (26/52) of the patients and 77% of these patients possessed clinically significant PCa. The sensitivities of both RFs in the validation cohort were ≥ 0.8.  Conclusion:   Visual PSMA-PET image interpretation may miss small but clinically significant PCa in a relevant number of patients and RFs can be implemented to uncover them. This could be used for guiding personalized treatments.""","""['Constantinos Zamboglou#', 'Alisa S Bettermann#', 'Christian Gratzke', 'Michael Mix', 'Juri Ruf', 'Selina Kiefer', 'Cordula A Jilg', 'Matthias Benndorf', 'Simon Spohn', 'Thomas F Fassbender', 'Peter Bronsert', 'Mengxia Chen', 'Hongqian Guo', 'Feng Wang', 'Xuefeng Qiu#', 'Anca-Ligia Grosu#']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Eur J Nucl Med Mol Imaging""","""['Machine learning-based prediction of invisible intraprostatic prostate cancer lesions on 68\xa0Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT in patients with primary prostate cancer.', 'More advantages in detecting bone and soft tissue metastases from prostate cancer using 18F-PSMA PET/CT.', 'Intraindividual comparison between 68Ga-PSMA-PET/CT and mpMRI for intraprostatic tumor delineation in patients with primary prostate cancer: a retrospective analysis in 101 patients.', '68Ga-PSMA-PET/CT Has a Role in Detecting Prostate Cancer Lesions in Patients with Recurrent Disease.', 'PET/CT With 68Ga-PSMA in Prostate Cancer: Radiopharmaceutical Background and Clinical Implications.', 'Optimal 18F-FDG PET/CT radiomics model development for predicting EGFR mutation status and prognosis in lung adenocarcinoma: a multicentric study.', 'A Systematic Review of the Variability in Performing and Reporting Intraprostatic Prostate-specific Membrane Antigen Positron Emission Tomography in Primary Staging Studies.', 'Detecting localised prostate cancer using radiomic features in PSMA PET and multiparametric MRI for biologically targeted radiation therapy.', 'Radiomics vs radiologist in prostate cancer.

The diagnostic performance of PSAD and the sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of prostate cancer (PCa) and high-grade prostate cancer (HGPCa) at different cutoff values were evaluated. A total of 5220 patients were included in the study, and 2014 (38.6%) of them were diagnosed with PCa. In patients with PSA levels ranging from 4.0 to 10.0 ng ml-1, PSAD was associated with PCa and HGPCa in both univariate (odds ratio [OR] = 45.15, P < 0.0001 and OR = 25.38, P < 0.0001, respectively) and multivariate analyses (OR = 52.55, P < 0.0001 and OR = 26.05, P < 0.0001, respectively). The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUCs) of PSAD in predicting PCa and HGPCa were 0.627 and 0.630, respectively. With the PSAD cutoff of 0.10 ng ml-2, we obtained a sensitivity of 88.7% for PCa, and nearly all (89.9%) HGPCa cases could be detected and biopsies could be avoided in 20.2% of the patients (359/1776 cases). Among these patients who avoided biopsies, only 30 cases had HGPCa. We recommend 0.10 ng ml-2 as the proper cutoff value of PSAD, which will obtain a sensitivity of nearly 90% for both PCa and HGPCa.

USP7 knockdown effectively induced cell death in several cancer cells of lung, prostate, and cervix.

The challenge to achieve FLASH using x-rays, besides developing a high output linac, is to intensity-modulate the high-dose-rate x-rays so that the biological gain is not offset by the lack of physical dose conformity. In this study, we develop the ROtational direct Aperture optimization with a Decoupled ring-collimator (ROAD) to achieve simultaneous ultrafast delivery and complex dose modulation. The ROAD design includes a fast-rotating slip-ring linac and a decoupled collimator-ring with 75 pre-shaped multi-leaf-collimator (MLC) modules. The ring-source rotates at 1 rotation per second (rps) clockwise while the ring-collimator is either static or rotating at 1 rps counterclockwise, achieving 75 (ROAD-75) or 150 (ROAD-150) equal-angular beams for one full arc. The Direct Aperture Optimization (DAO) for ROAD was formulated to include a least-square dose fidelity, an anisotropic total variation term, and a single segment term. The FLASH dose (FD) and FLASH biological equivalent dose (FBED) were computed voxelwise, with the latter using a spatiotemporal model accounting for radiolytic oxygen depletion. ROAD was compared with clinical volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) on a brain, a lung, a prostate, and a head and neck cancer patient. The mean dose rate of ROAD-75 and ROAD-150 are 76.2 Gy s-1 and 112 Gy s-1 respectively to deliver 25 Gy single-fraction dose in 1 s. With improved PTV homogeneity, ROAD-150 reduced (max, mean) OAR physical dose by (4.8 Gy, 6.3 Gy). The average R50 and integral dose of (VMAT, ROAD-75, ROAD-150) are (4.8, 3.2, 3.2) and (89, 57, 56) Gy×Liter, respectively. The FD and FBED showed model dependent FLASH effects.

Materials and methods:   A total of 45 patients with localized high risk prostate cancer who had serial 68Ga-PSMA-11 positron emission tomography/computerized tomography scans before and after 6 months of androgen deprivation therapy plus abiraterone neoadjuvant treatment followed by radical prostatectomy were included in this study. Complete pathological response or minimal residual disease <5 mm on whole mount histopathology was defined as favorable pathological response. The diagnostic performance of prostate specific antigen response and positron emission tomography/computerized tomography response for favorable pathological response was calculated. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses of clinical and imaging variables were also performed to identify favorable pathological response.  Results:   Compared to the prostate specific antigen response, positron emission tomography/computerized tomography response had a significantly higher specificity in diagnosing favorable pathological response (89.7% vs 62.1%, p=0.043). Preoperative nadir prostate specific antigen (OR 0.121, 95% CI 0.028-0.529, p=0.005), posttreatment maximum standardized uptake value (OR 7.072, 95% CI 2.035-24.579, p=0.002) and posttreatment tumor volume (OR 7.896, 95% CI 1.415-44.054, p=0.018) measured on positron emission tomography/computerized tomography were significantly associated with favorable pathological response in univariable logistic regression analysis. On multivariable logistic regression analysis, only posttreatment maximum standardized uptake value was found to be an independent predictor of favorable pathological response (OR 9.69, 95% CI 1.439-65.242, p=0.020).  Conclusions: 68Ga-PSMA positron emission tomography/computerized tomography has a better diagnostic performance of pathological response to neoadjuvant treatment compared with prostate specific antigen, with maximum standardized uptake value being an independent predictive factor.

Methods:   The design of ADAM PETer was based on our previous pelvis phantom (ADAM) and extended for compatibility with PET and use in 3T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The formerly manually manufactured silicon organ surrogates were replaced by three-dimensional (3D) printed organ shells. Two intraprostatic lesions, four iliac lymph node metastases and two pelvic bone metastases were added to simulate prostate cancer as multifocal and metastatic disease. Radiological properties [computed tomography (CT) and 3T MRI] of cortical bone, bone marrow and adipose tissue were simulated by heavy gypsum, a mixture of Vaseline and K2 HPO4 and peanut oil, respectively. For soft tissues, agarose gels with varying concentrations of agarose, gadolinium (Gd) and sodium fluoride (NaF) were developed. The agarose gels were doped with patient-specific activity concentrations of a Fluorine-18 labelled compound and then filled into the 3D printed organ shells of prostate lesions, lymph node and bone metastases. The phantom was imaged at a dual energy CT and a 3T PET/MRI scanner.  Results:   The compositions of the soft tissue surrogates are the following (given as mass fractions of agarose[w%]/NaF[w%]/Gd[w%]): Muscle (4/1/0.027), prostate (1.35/4.2/0.011), prostate lesions (2.25/4.2/0.0085), lymph node and bone metastases (1.4/4.2/0.025).

Further study proved that a disintegrin and metalloproteinase ADAM17 as an executor of E-cadherin cleavage mediated the inhibitory regulation of CD82 in E-cadherin shedding in prostate cancer. Specifically, CD82 interacted with ADAM17 and inhibited its metalloprotease activity, which led to the descent of E-cadherin shedding.

Glycoproteins play essential roles in cancer development, while urine is a noninvasive and easily obtainable biological fluid that contains secretory glycoproteins from the urogenital system. Therefore, here we aimed to identify urinary glycoproteins that are capable of differentiating aggressive from non-aggressive prostate cancer. Methods: Quantitative mass spectrometry data of glycopeptides from a discovery cohort comprised of 74 aggressive (Gleason score ≥8) and 68 non-aggressive (Gleason score = 6) prostate cancer urine specimens were acquired via a data independent acquisition approach. The glycopeptides showing distinct expression profiles in aggressive relative to non-aggressive prostate cancer were further evaluated for their performance in distinguishing the two groups either individually or in combination with others using repeated 5-fold cross validation with logistic regression to build predictive models. Predictive models showing good performance from the discovery cohort were further evaluated using a validation cohort. Results: Among the 20 candidate glycoproteins, urinary ACPP outperformed the other candidates. Urinary ACPP can also serve as an adjunct to serum PSA to further improve the discrimination power for aggressive prostate cancer (AUC= 0.82, 95% confidence interval 0.75 to 0.89). A three-signature panel including urinary ACPP, urinary CLU, and serum PSA displayed the ability to distinguish aggressive prostate cancer from non-aggressive prostate cancer with an AUC of 0.86 (95% confidence interval 0.8 to 0.92). Another three-signature panel containing urinary ACPP, urinary LOX, and serum PSA also demonstrated its ability in recognizing aggressive prostate cancer (AUC=0.82, 95% confidence interval 0.75 to 0.9). Moreover, consistent performance was observed from each panel when evaluated using a validation cohort.

We retrospectively analyzed data of men who underwent TRUS-guided prostate biopsy because of elevated PSA (≤ 20 ng/ml) or abnormal digital rectal examination. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis to compare PSA and PSAD performance and chi-square automatic interaction detector methodologies were used to identify predictors of clinically significant cancer (Gleason score ≥ 7 or international society of urological pathology grade group ≥ 2). Nine-hundred and ninety-two consecutive men with a median age of 66 years (IQR 61-71) were included in the study. Median PSAD was 0.10 ng/ml2 (IQR 0.10-0.22). Prostate adenocarcinoma was diagnosed in 338 men (34%). Clinically significant prostate adenocarcinoma was diagnosed in 167 patients (50% of all cancers and 17% of the whole cohort). The AUC to predict clinically significant prostate cancer was 0.64 for PSA and 0.78 for PSAD (P < 0.001). The highest Youden's index for PSAD was at 0.20 ng/ml2 with 70% sensitivity and 79% specificity for the diagnosis of clinically significant cancer. Men with PSAD < 0.09 ng/ml2 had only 4% chance of having clinically significant disease. The detection rate of clinically significant prostate cancer in patients with PSAD between 0.09 and 0.19 ng/ml2 was significantly higher when prostate volume was less than 33 ml. In conclusion, PSAD was a better predictor than PSA alone of clinically significant prostate cancer in patients undergoing TRUS-guided biopsy. Patients with PSAD below 0.09 ng/ml2 were unlikely to harbor clinically significant prostate cancer. Combining PSAD in the gray zone (0.09-0.19) with prostate volume below 33 ml adds diagnostic value of clinically significant prostate cancer.""","""['Igor Yusim', 'Muhammad Krenawi', 'Elad Mazor', 'Victor Novack', 'Nicola J Mabjeesh']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Sci Rep""","""['Usefulness and predictive value of PSA density, adjusted by transition zone volume, in men with PSA levels between 2 and 4 ng/ml.', 'Peripheral zone PSA density: a predominant variable to improve prostate cancer detection efficiency in men with PSA higher than 4 ng ml-1.', 'Detection of prostate carcinoma using prostate specific antigen, its density, and the density of the transition zone in Japanese men with intermediate serum prostate specific antigen concentrations.', 'The performance characteristics of prostate-specific antigen and prostate-specific antigen density in Chinese men.', 'Evaluation of prostate specific antigen density and transrectal ultrasonography-guided biopsies in 100 consecutive patients with a negative digital rectal examination and intermediate serum prostate specific antigen levels.', 'The role of quantitative MRI-based prostate zonal parameters in predicting clinically significant prostate cancer A U.S. cohort.', 'Prostate-specific antigen density as the best predictor of low- to intermediate-risk prostate cancer: a cohort study.', 'Underlying Features of Prostate Cancer-Statistics, Risk Factors, and Emerging Methods for Its Diagnosis.', 'Screening for prostate cancer: protocol for updating multiple systematic reviews to inform a Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care guideline update.', 'Clinicopathological features and prevalence of prostate cancer in Aseer, Saudi Arabia.']"""

Through enhanced manoeuvrability and surgical autonomy, the DROP-IN promotes the implementation of radioguided surgery in the robotic setting.  Objective:   To confirm the utility and safety profile of the DROP-IN gamma probe and to perform a comparison with the traditional laparoscopic gamma probe and fluorescence guidance.  Design, setting, and participants:   Twenty-five prostate cancer patients were scheduled for a robot-assisted sentinel lymph node (SN) procedure, extended pelvic lymph node dissection, and prostatectomy at a single European centre.  Surgical procedure:   After intraprostatic injection of indocyanine green (ICG)-99mTc-nanocolloid (n = 12) or 99mTc-nanocolloid + ICG (n = 13), SN locations were defined using preoperative imaging. Surgical excision of SNs was performed under image guidance using the DROP-IN gamma probe, the traditional laparoscopic gamma probe, and fluorescence imaging.  Measurements:   Intraoperative SN detection was assessed for the different modalities and related to anatomical locations. Patient follow-up was included (a median of 18 mo).  Results and limitations:   Overall, 47 SNs were pursued in vivo by the DROP-IN gamma probe, of which 100% were identified. No adverse events related to its use were observed. In vivo fluorescence imaging identified 91% of these SNs. The laparoscopic gamma probe identified only 76% of these SNs, where the detection inaccuracies appeared to be related to specific anatomical regions.  Conclusions:   Owing to improved manoeuvrability, the DROP-IN probe yielded improved SN detection rates compared with the traditional gamma probe and fluorescence imaging. These findings underline that the DROP-IN technology provides a valuable tool for radioguided surgery in the robotic setting.  Patient summary:   Radioguided robot-assisted surgery with the novel DROP-IN gamma probe is feasible and safe. It enables more efficient intraoperative identification of sentinel lymph nodes than can be achieved with a traditional laparoscopic gamma probe.

Our in vitro studies including gene expression profiling using bladder cancer cell lines revealed that OMD or PRELP application suppressed the cancer progression by inhibiting TGF-β and EGF pathways, which reversed epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), activated cell-cell adhesion, and inhibited various oncogenic pathways. Furthermore, the overexpression of OMD in bladder cancer cells strongly inhibited the anchorage-independent growth and tumorigenicity in mouse xenograft studies. On the other hand, we found that in the bladder epithelia, the knockout mice of OMD and/or PRELP gene caused partial EMT and a loss of tight junctions of the umbrella cells and resulted in formation of a bladder carcinoma in situ-like structure by spontaneous breakdowns of the umbrella cell layer. Furthermore, the ontological analysis of the expression profiling of an OMD knockout mouse bladder demonstrated very high similarity with those obtained from human bladder cancers.

Objective:   To evaluate if deep learning approaches identify more germline pathogenic variants in patients with cancer.  Design, setting, and participants:   A cross-sectional study of a standard germline detection method and a deep learning method in 2 convenience cohorts with prostate cancer and melanoma enrolled in the US and Europe between 2010 and 2017. The final date of clinical data collection was December 2017.  Exposures:   Germline variant detection using standard or deep learning methods.  Main outcomes and measures:   The primary outcomes included pathogenic variant detection performance in 118 cancer-predisposition genes estimated as sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV). The secondary outcomes were pathogenic variant detection performance in 59 genes deemed actionable by the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) and 5197 clinically relevant mendelian genes. True sensitivity and true specificity could not be calculated due to lack of a criterion reference standard, but were estimated as the proportion of true-positive variants and true-negative variants, respectively, identified by each method in a reference variant set that consisted of all variants judged to be valid from either approach.  Results:   The prostate cancer cohort included 1072 men (mean [SD] age at diagnosis, 63.7 [7.9] years; 857 [79.9%] with European ancestry) and the melanoma cohort included 1295 patients (mean [SD] age at diagnosis, 59.8 [15.6] years; 488 [37.7%] women; 1060 [81.9%] with European ancestry). The deep learning method identified more patients with pathogenic variants in cancer-predisposition genes than the standard method (prostate cancer: 198 vs 182; melanoma: 93 vs 74); sensitivity (prostate cancer: 94.7% vs 87.1% [difference, 7.6%; 95% CI, 2.2% to 13.1%]; melanoma: 74.4% vs 59.2% [difference, 15.2%; 95% CI, 3.7% to 26.7%]), specificity (prostate cancer: 64.0% vs 36.0% [difference, 28.0%; 95% CI, 1.4% to 54.6%]; melanoma: 63.4% vs 36.6% [difference, 26.8%; 95% CI, 17.6% to 35.9%]), PPV (prostate cancer: 95.7% vs 91.9% [difference, 3.8%; 95% CI, -1.0% to 8.4%]; melanoma: 54.4% vs 35.4% [difference, 19.0%; 95% CI, 9.1% to 28.9%]), and NPV (prostate cancer: 59.3% vs 25.0% [difference, 34.3%; 95% CI, 10.9% to 57.6%]; melanoma: 80.8% vs 60.5% [difference, 20.3%; 95% CI, 10.0% to 30.7%]). For the ACMG genes, the sensitivity of the 2 methods was not significantly different in the prostate cancer cohort (94.9% vs 90.6% [difference, 4.3%; 95% CI, -2.3% to 10.9%]), but the deep learning method had a higher sensitivity in the melanoma cohort (71.6% vs 53.7% [difference, 17.9%; 95% CI, 1.82% to 34.0%]). The deep learning method had higher sensitivity in the mendelian genes (prostate cancer: 99.7% vs 95.1% [difference, 4.6%; 95% CI, 3.0% to 6.3%]; melanoma: 91.7% vs 86.2% [difference, 5.5%; 95% CI, 2.2% to 8.8%]).  Conclusions and relevance:   Among a convenience sample of 2 independent cohorts of patients with prostate cancer and melanoma, germline genetic testing using deep learning, compared with the current standard genetic testing method, was associated with higher sensitivity and specificity for detection of pathogenic variants.

Methods:   Data from the National Research Council PCa monitoring multicenter project in Italy (Pros-IT CNR) were prospectively collected and analyzed. WT was defined as the time from the bioptical diagnosis of PCa to the first treatment received. Patients were divided in two groups, using a time frame of 90 days. Quality of life was measured through the Italian version of the University of California Los Angeles-Prostate Cancer Index (UCLA-PCI) and of the Short-Form Health Survey (SF-12). The occurrence of upgrading, upstaging, presence of lymph node metastasis and positive surgical margins at the final histopathological diagnosis, and PSA at 12 months follow-up were evaluated.  Results:   The overall median WT was 93 days. The logistic multivariable model confirmed that age, being resident in Southern regions of Italy and T staging at diagnosis were significantly associated with a WT>90 days. At 6 months from diagnosis the mean SF-12 score for the emotional-psychological component was significantly lower in WT≥90 days group (P=0.0428). Among patients treated with surgical approach, no significant differences in oncological outcomes were found in the two groups.

One reason for the improvement in mortality is screening for several common cancers in people at average risk for breast, cervical, colorectal, and prostate cancers, and screening for lung cancer in those with a 20-plus pack-year history. Such screening may result in earlier diagnosis when the cancer is most likely to respond to treatment. However, there are no population-based screening recommendations for the majority of cancers in average-risk patients, most of which are not diagnosed until the later stages. One question is whether earlier diagnosis could not only reduce mortality rates but also reduce medical costs. Screening comes with several potential risks, including false positives and overdiagnosis, both of which can affect patients' mental health, increase morbidity and mortality, and lead to excess spending. Additionally, certain cancers can evade traditional screening tests and lead to false-negative results, which delays cancer detection, treatment, and may affect treatment efficacy. The advent of liquid biopsy tests that could screen for dozens of cancers holds promise for identifying more cancers early. However, the cost, the potential for overdiagnosis and false positives, and a lack of evidence demonstrating clinical utility or an improvement in health outcomes call into question their potential use for widespread screening.

However, several new agents for CRPC after first‑line chemotherapy prolonged survival by only a few months. To develop a new treatment modality, we conducted a phase III randomized trial of personalized peptide vaccination (PPV) for human leukocyte antigen (HLA)‑A24‑positive patients with castration‑resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) for whom docetaxel chemotherapy failed. This randomized, double‑blind, placebo‑controlled, phase III trial was carried out at 68 medical centers in Japan. Patients were randomly assigned at a 2:1 ratio to receive PPV or placebo. Four of 12 warehouse peptides selected based on pre‑existing peptide‑specific immunoglobulin G levels or the corresponding placebo were subcutaneously injected in 6 doses weekly and then bi‑weekly following the maximum of 30 doses until disease progression. The primary end‑point was overall survival (OS). Efficacy analyses were performed by the full analysis set. Between August 2013 and April 2016, 310 patients were randomly assigned, and 306 patients were analyzed. Baseline characteristics were balanced between groups. The estimated median OS was 16.1 months [95% confidence interval (CI), 13‑18.2] with PPV and 16.9 months (95% CI, 13.1‑20.4) with placebo [hazard ratio (HR), 1.04, 95% CI, 0.80‑1.37; P=0.77].

This study demonstrates a novel metabolic function of c-Myc (Myc) in regulation of fatty acid synthesis. The role of Myc in regulation of fatty acid synthesis was investigated by: (a) interrogation of the prostate cancer The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset, (b) chromatin immunoprecipitation, and (c) determination of the expression of fatty acid synthesis enzymes and targeted metabolomics using a mouse model and human specimens. The expression of MYC was positively associated with that of key fatty acid synthesis genes including ACLY, ACC1, and FASN in prostate cancer TCGA dataset. Chromatin immunoprecipitation revealed Myc occupancy at the promoters of ACLY, ACC1, and FASN. Prostate-specific overexpression of Myc in Hi-Myc transgenic mice resulted in overexpression of ACLY, ACC1, and FASN proteins in neoplastic lesions and increased circulating levels of total free fatty acids. Targeted metabolomics confirmed increased circulating levels of individual fatty acids in the plasma of Hi-Myc mice and human subjects when compared to corresponding controls. Immunohistochemistry also revealed a positive and statistically significant association in expression of Myc with that of ACC1 in human prostate adenocarcinoma specimens.

We previously identified carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 5 (CEACAM5) as a promising NEPC cell surface antigen. Here we investigated the scope of CEACAM5 expression in end-stage prostate cancer, the basis for CEACAM5 enrichment in NEPC, and the therapeutic potential of the CEACAM5 antibody-drug conjugate labetuzumab govitecan in prostate cancer.  Experimental design:   The expression of CEACAM5 and other clinically relevant antigens was characterized by multiplex immunofluorescence of a tissue microarray comprising metastatic tumors from 34 lethal metastatic CRPC (mCRPC) cases. A genetically defined neuroendocrine transdifferentiation assay of prostate cancer was developed to evaluate mechanisms of CEACAM5 regulation in NEPC. The specificity and efficacy of labetuzumab govitecan was determined in CEACAM5+ prostate cancer cell lines and patient-derived xenografts models.  Results:   CEACAM5 expression was enriched in NEPC compared with other mCRPC subtypes and minimally overlapped with prostate-specific membrane antigen, prostate stem cell antigen, and trophoblast cell surface antigen 2 expression. We focused on a correlation between the expression of the pioneer transcription factor ASCL1 and CEACAM5 to determine that ASCL1 can drive neuroendocrine reprogramming of prostate cancer which is associated with increased chromatin accessibility of the CEACAM5 core promoter and CEACAM5 expression. Labetuzumab govitecan induced DNA damage in CEACAM5+ prostate cancer cell lines and marked antitumor responses in CEACAM5+ CRPC xenograft models including chemotherapy-resistant NEPC.

Materials and methods:   All patients with intermediate-risk and high-risk prostate cancer who received combination therapy at our institution were identified between 2014 and 2019. Dosimetric outcomes of brachytherapy implants and quality of life (QOL) outcomes were compared between patients who had and had not received a hydrogel spacer.  Results:   A Total of 168 patients meeting our inclusion criteria were identified. Twenty-two patients had received a rectal hydrogel spacer, among whom the mean separation between the rectum and prostate was 7.5 mm, and the V100rectum was reduced by 47% (0.09 cc vs. 0.17 cc, p = 0.04).

We employed the Mendelian randomization design to test the hypothesis that higher plasma phospholipid AA concentrations are associated with increased risk of 10 site-specific cancers.  Methods:   Two genetic variants associated with plasma phospholipid concentrations of AA (rs174547 in FADS1 [P = 3.0 × 10-971] and rs16966952 in PDXDC1 [P = 2.4 × 10-10]) in the Cohorts for Heart and Aging Research in Genomic Epidemiology Consortium were used as genetic instruments. The associations of those variants with cancer were taken from the UK Biobank (n = 367,643), FinnGen consortium (n = 135,638), International Lung Cancer Consortium (n = 27,209), Prostate Cancer Association Group to Investigate Cancer Associated Alterations in the Genome consortium (n = 140,254), Breast Cancer Association Consortium (n = 228,951), Ovarian Cancer Association Consortium (n = 66,450), and BioBank Japan (n = 212,453).  Results:   Higher genetically predicted plasma phospholipid AA concentrations were associated with increased risk of colorectal and lung cancer. Results were consistent across data sources and variants. The combined odds ratios per standard deviation increase of AA concentrations were 1.08 (95% CI 1.05-1.11; P = 6.3 × 10-8) for colorectal cancer and 1.07 (95%CI 1.05-1.10; P = 3.5 × 10-7) for lung cancer. Genetically predicted AA concentrations had a suggestive positive association with esophageal cancer (odds ratio 1.09; 95% CI 1.02-1.17; P = 0.016) but were not associated with cancers of the stomach, pancreas, bladder, prostate, breast, uterus, or ovary.  Conclusion:   These results indicate that AA may be implicated in the development of colorectal and lung cancer and possibly esophageal cancer.

Methods:   Patients with prostate cancer in the urology clinics of three hospitals are recruited via a convenience sampling. Patients completed the MAX-PC-T, Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS), and the Short Form (SF)-12 Health Survey. The internal consistency is tested to determine the reliability of the MAX-PC-T. The correlation among the MAX-PC-T, PANAS, and SF-12 is used to test concurrent and discriminant validity. Confirmatory factor analysis is performed to determine the convergent and discriminant validity of the scale.  Results:   The MAX-PC-T conforms to the three structures of the original MAX-PC, which includes the prostate cancer anxiety subscale, prostate-specific antigen anxiety subscale, and fear of recurrence subscale. The factor loading of the items in each subscale is >0.50. The MAX-PC-T was significantly negatively correlated with the positive affect subscale of the PANAS and the mental component summary of the SF-12 and significantly positively correlated with the negative affect subscale of the PANAS.

The long-term clinical significance of consecutively negative biopsies is not known.  Materials and methods:   Men with low risk prostate cancer prospectively enrolled in an active surveillance database with at least 4 biopsies were included in the study. Exposure variables were 0, 1 or 2 consecutively negative biopsies after diagnosis. Other variables included age, prostate specific antigen, prostate specific antigen density, Gleason grade group, percent positive cores and magnetic resonance imaging findings. Outcome variables were the detection of any cancer at fourth biopsy and active treatment.  Results:   A total of 514 men were included, with 112 (22%) men having 1 negative biopsy and 78 (15%) with 2 consecutively negative biopsies. Median prostate specific antigen density was lower for men with 1 negative biopsy (0.11) and consecutively negative biopsies (0.10) compared to men who never had a negative biopsy (0.13, p <0.01). On univariable logistic regression higher prostate specific antigen density (OR 1.68, 95% CI 1.16-2.45) and suspicious magnetic resonance imaging lesions (OR 2.00, 95% CI 1.16-3.42) were associated with a higher likelihood of detecting cancer on fourth biopsy. On multivariable logistic regression 1 negative biopsy (OR 0.22, 95% CI 0.12-0.41) and consecutively negative biopsies (OR 0.12, 95% CI 0.06-0.24) were associated with a lower likelihood of detecting cancer at outcome biopsy. Unadjusted 10-year treatment-free survival was highest for patients with consecutively negative biopsies (84%) and 1 negative biopsy (74%) than those who had none (66%) (log rank p=0.02).

Whether low-level exposure is associated with PCa aggressiveness remains unknown. We examined the association between urinary arsenic and PCa aggressiveness among men in North Carolina. This cross-sectional study included 463 African-American and 491 European-American men with newly diagnosed, histologically confirmed prostate adenocarcinoma. PCa aggressiveness was defined as low aggressive (Gleason score < 7, stage = cT1-cT2, and PSA < 10 ng/mL) versus intermediate/high aggressive (all other cases). Total arsenic and arsenical species (inorganic arsenic (iAsIII + iAsV), arsenobetaine, monomethyl arsenic, and dimethyl arsenic)) and specific gravity were measured in spot urine samples obtained an average of 23.7 weeks after diagnosis. Multivariable logistic regression was used to estimate the covariate-adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for PCa aggressiveness in association with arsenic tertiles/quantiles overall and by race. The highest (vs. lowest) tertile of total arsenic was associated with PCa aggressiveness ORs of 1.77 (95% CI = 1.05-2.98) among European-American men, and 0.94 (95% CI = 0.57-1.56) among African-American men (PInteraction = 0.04). In contrast, total arsenic and arsenical species were not associated with PCa aggressiveness in unstratified models. Low-level arsenic exposure may be associated with PCa aggressiveness among European-Americans, but not among African-Americans.""","""['Humberto Parada Jr', 'Tianying Wu', 'Rebecca C Fry', 'Laura Farnan', 'Gary J Smith', 'James L Mohler', 'Jeannette T Bensen']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Int J Environ Res Public Health""","""['Carotenoid intake and adipose tissue carotenoid levels in relation to prostate cancer aggressiveness among African-American and European-American men in the North Carolina-Louisiana prostate cancer project (PCaP).', 'Calcium, magnesium, and whole-milk intakes and high-aggressive prostate cancer in the North Carolina-Louisiana Prostate Cancer Project (PCaP).', 'Obesity and prostate cancer aggressiveness among African and Caucasian Americans in a population-based study.', 'Prostate cancer disparities in South Carolina: early detection, special programs, and descriptive epidemiology.', 'Do African American men have lower survival from prostate cancer compared with White men?

The prostate-specific antigen density (PSAd) has been identified as a diagnostic tool that helps to predict clinically significant prostate cancer (csCaP). The aim of this study is to evaluate the association of the volume of the Pi-RADS 3 lesions and the PSAd in the diagnosis of csCaP.  Material and methods:   We conducted a retrospective study that included prostate biopsies performed using a transperineal approach and guided by ultrasound between 2015 and 2020. csCaP was defined as Gleason score ≥3 + 4. The population was divided into groups according to the Pi-RADS 3 subclassification and the PSAd value. We calculated sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value (NPV) and positive predictive value (PPV) of 3b lesions for the detection of high-grade prostate cancer, alone and combined with PSAD groups.  Results:   In total, 99 patients with Pi-RADS 3 lesions were included. Forty-three patients were in group 3a and 56, in 3b. Mean PSA was 7.28 ± 2.6 ng/ml. Pi-RADS 3a lesion did not present csCaP but 17.8% of Pi-RADS 3b lesion did. In group 3b with PSAd > 0.15, 62.5% presented csCaP. In those Pi-RADS 3b with PSAd ≤ 0.15, all biopsies were insignificant prostate cancer (isCaP) and 40 biopsies could have been avoided. Considering 3b as positive for csCaP detection, sensitivity was 100%, specificity 48.3%, NPV 17.8%, and PPV 100%. When adding PSAd to group 3b, sensitivity was 100%, specificity was 86.9%, NPV was 62.5%, PPV was 100%. In total, only the subgroup 3b with PSAd > 0.15 presented csCaP and 83.8% biopsies could be avoided.

Assessing proxies of reproductive factors may offer insights into PCa pathogenesis. In this study, we examined fatherhood status as a proxy of fertility in relation to total, nonaggressive, aggressive, and fatal PCa.  Methods:   We examined participants of two cohorts, the NIH-AARP Diet and Health (NIH-AARP) Study and Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer Screening Trial. We used Cox proportional hazards regression to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals of associations between fatherhood status and number of children sired in relation to PCa incidence.  Results:   Fatherhood status (one or more children vs. childless) was positively associated with total PCa risk in NIH-AARP or PLCO, but was not statistically significant (p = 0.06 and 0.55, respectively). Number of children sired indicated a slightly elevated risk of total PCa, but HRs were rarely significant and were of a fairly constant magnitude with no discernable trend relative to the childless referent group. Associations were similar for nonaggressive and aggressive PCa. The trend test for fatal PCa was statistically significant in NIH-AARP (ptrend < 0.01), despite none of the individual categorical point estimates reaching this threshold.  Conclusion:   This study provides tentative evidence that fathering children is associated with a slightly increased PCa risk. Future research should strive to assess better proxies of reproductive function in relation to aggressive and fatal PCa to provide more specific evidence for this putative relationship.""","""['Ashley M Geczik', 'Scott P Kelly', 'Ruth M Pfeiffer', 'Wen-Yi Huang', 'Linda M Liao', 'Cindy K Zhou', 'Louise A Brinton', 'Michael B Cook']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Cancer Med""","""['Body mass index trajectories across adulthood and smoking in relation to prostate cancer risks: the NIH-AARP Diet and Health Study.', 'Fatherhood and incident prostate cancer in a prospective US cohort.', 'Prediagnostic Body Mass Index Trajectories in Relation to Prostate Cancer Incidence and Mortality in the PLCO Cancer Screening Trial.', 'Adolescent dairy product and calcium intake in relation to later prostate cancer risk and mortality in the NIH-AARP Diet and Health Study.', 'Obesity and prostate cancer incidence and mortality: a systematic review of prospective cohort studies.']"""

Notably, the androgen receptor (AR) is essential for both normal development of prostate and prostate cancer progression.  Methods:   The RNA sequencing was used to identify the novel long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) termed PCAL7. The RT-qPCR was performed to quantify PCAL7 expression. Migration and proliferation assays were used to examine the function of PCAL7. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was used to determine subcellular localization.  Results:   By RNA sequencing, the differentially expressed lncRNAs were identified (top 10 upregulated lncRNAs: PCAL7, AC083843.1, CTC-338M12.3, RP11-443B7.1, RP11-1008C21.2, RN7SL329P, RP4-773N10.4, RP11-264B17.2, KB-1507C5.2, and RP11-20B24.6; top 10 downregulated lncRNAs: RP11-77H9.2, RAB11FIP1P1, AP001625.6, CTA-217C2.1, RP11-603J24.7, RP11-315I20.1, AC092839.1, RP4-758J18.10, RP11-259O2.3, and HMGN2P17). PCAL7 was the lncRNA with the highest fold upregulation and significantly correlated with AR signaling during prostate cancer progression. The AR-regulated PCAL7 was abundantly overexpressed in prostate cancer tissues and AR-dependent cell lines. PCAL7 knockdown inhibited cell migration and proliferation. Consistently, the migration and proliferation were promoted by PCAL7 overexpression. PCAL7 depletion via antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) markedly suppressed AR signaling and tumor growth. Mechanistically, PCAL7 interacted with Huntingtin-interacting protein 1 (HIP1) to stabilize HIP1. Therefore, PCAL7 could advance AR signaling via a novel positive feedback loop.

Knock-down of plectin inhibits prostate cancer cell growth and colony formation in vitro, and growth of prostate cancer xenografts in vivo. Plectin knock-down further impairs aggressive and invasive cellular behavior assessed by migration, invasion, and wound healing in vitro. Consistently, plectin knock-down cells have impaired metastatic colonization to distant sites including liver, lung, kidney, bone, and genitourinary system. Plectin knock-down inhibited number of metastases per organ, as well as decreased overall metastatic burden. To gain insights into the role of plectin in prostate cancer growth and metastasis, we performed proteomic analysis of prostate cancer plectin knock-down xenograft tissues. Gene set enrichment analysis shows an increase in levels of proteins involved with extracellular matrix and laminin interactions, and a decrease in levels of proteins regulating amino acid metabolism, cytoskeletal proteins, and cellular response to stress.

We found that overexpression of ABHD5 induces cell cycle arrest at the G1 phase and causes growth retardation in a panel of prostate cancer cells. Transcriptomic profiling and biochemical analysis revealed that genetic or pharmacological activation of lipolysis by ABHD5 potently inhibits mTORC1 signaling, leading to a significant downregulation of protein synthesis. Mechanistically, we found that ABHD5 elevates intracellular AMP content, which activates AMPK, leading to inhibition of mTORC1. Interestingly, ABHD5-dependent suppression of mTORC1 was abrogated by pharmacological inhibition of DGAT1 or DGAT2, isoenzymes that re-esterify fatty acids in a process that consumes ATP.

It is hypothesized that high-dose radiotherapy may enhance or suppress tumor-reactive immunity. The objective of this study was to assess both antitumor and immunosuppressive effects induced by high-dose radiotherapy in prostate cancer coclinical models, and ultimately, to test whether a combination of radiotherapy with targeted immunotherapy can enhance antitumor immunity.  Experimental design:   We studied the effects of high-dose per fraction radiotherapy with and without anti-Gr-1 using syngeneic murine allograft prostate cancer models. The dynamic change of immune populations, including tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL), T regulatory cells (Treg), and myeloid-derived suppressive cells (MDSC), was evaluated using flow cytometry and IHC.  Results:   Coclinical prostate cancer models demonstrated that high-dose per fraction radiotherapy induced a rapid increase of tumor-infiltrating MDSCs and a subsequent rise of CD8 TILs and circulating CD8 T effector memory cells. These radiation-induced CD8 TILs were more functionally potent than those from nonirradiated controls. While systemic depletion of MDSCs by anti-Gr-1 effectively prevented MDSC tumor infiltration, it did not enhance radiotherapy-induced antitumor immunity due to a compensatory expansion of Treg-mediated immune suppression.  Conclusions:   In allograft prostate cancer models, high-dose radiotherapy induced an early rise of MDSCs, followed by a transient increase of functionally active CD8 TILs. However, systemic depletion of MDSC did not augment the antitumor efficacy of high-dose radiotherapy due to a compensatory Treg response, indicating blocking both MDSCs and Tregs might be necessary to enhance radiotherapy-induced antitumor immunity.""","""['Lin Lin', 'Nathanael Kane', 'Naoko Kobayashi', 'Evelyn A Kono', 'Joyce M Yamashiro', 'Nicholas G Nickols', 'Robert E Reiter']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Clin Cancer Res""","""['SMAC Mimetic Debio 1143 and Ablative Radiation Therapy Synergize to Enhance Antitumor Immunity against Lung Cancer.', 'Obesity-Associated Myeloid-Derived Suppressor Cells Promote Apoptosis of Tumor-Infiltrating CD8 T Cells and Immunotherapy Resistance in Breast Cancer.', 'Stereotactic Radiotherapy Increases Functionally Suppressive Regulatory T Cells in the Tumor Microenvironment.', 'Regulatory cells and the effect of cancer immunotherapy.', 'How to turn up the heat on the cold immune microenvironment of metastatic prostate cancer.', 'Ketoglutaric acid can reprogram the immunophenotype of triple-negative breast cancer after radiotherapy and improve the therapeutic effect of anti-PD-L1.', 'Radiotherapy combined with immunotherapy could improve the immune infiltration of melanoma in mice and enhance the abscopal effect.', 'Harnessing the Immunological Effects of Radiation to Improve Immunotherapies in Cancer.', 'Immunogenic hypofractionated radiotherapy sensitising head and neck squamous cell carcinoma to anti-PD-L1 therapy in MDSC-dependent manner.', 'Progression in immunotherapy for advanced prostate cancer.']"""

In this work, we investigate whether a neural network processing anisotropic multi-planar images could work in the context of a semantic segmentation task, and if so, how this additional information would improve the segmentation quality.  Methods:   We propose an anisotropic 3D multi-stream CNN architecture, which processes additional scan directions to produce a high-resolution isotropic prostate segmentation. We investigate two variants of our architecture, which work on two (dual-plane) and three (triple-plane) image orientations, respectively. The influence of additional information used by these models is evaluated by comparing them with a single-plane baseline processing only axial images. To realize a fair comparison, we employ a hyperparameter optimization strategy to select optimal configurations for the individual approaches.  Results:   Training and evaluation on two datasets spanning multiple sites show statistical significant improvement over the plain axial segmentation (p<0.05 on the Dice similarity coefficient). The improvement can be observed especially at the base (0.898 single-plane vs. 0.906 triple-plane) and apex (0.888 single-plane vs. 0.901 dual-plane).  Conclusion:   This study indicates that models employing two or three scan directions are superior to plain axial segmentation. The knowledge of precise boundaries of the prostate is crucial for the conservation of risk structures. Thus, the proposed models have the potential to improve the outcome of prostate cancer diagnosis and therapies.""","""['Anneke Meyer', 'Grzegorz Chlebus', 'Marko Rak', 'Daniel Schindele', 'Martin Schostak', 'Bram van Ginneken', 'Andrea Schenk', 'Hans Meine', 'Horst K Hahn', 'Andreas Schreiber', 'Christian Hansen']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Comput Methods Programs Biomed""","""['3D APA-Net: 3D Adversarial Pyramid Anisotropic Convolutional Network for Prostate Segmentation in MR Images.', 'Combined Transfer Learning and Test-Time Augmentation Improves Convolutional Neural Network-Based Semantic Segmentation of Prostate Cancer from Multi-Parametric MR Images.', 'Prostate segmentation in MRI using a convolutional neural network architecture and training strategy based on statistical shape models.', 'A distance map regularized CNN for cardiac cine MR image segmentation.', 'Investigation and benchmarking of U-Nets on prostate segmentation tasks.', 'Automatic segmentation of prostate zonal anatomy on MRI: a systematic review of the literature.', 'Dataset of prostate MRI annotated for anatomical zones and cancer.', 'Segmentation of the prostate, its zones, anterior fibromuscular stroma, and urethra on the MRIs and multimodality image fusion using U-Net model.', 'Integration of Deep Learning and Active Shape Models for More Accurate Prostate Segmentation in 3D MR Images.', 'Automatic zonal segmentation of the prostate from 2D and 3D T2-weighted MRI and evaluation for clinical use.']"""

This study was designed to determine whether anti-tumor properties of SFN, identified in other tumor entities, are also evident in cultivated DU145 and PC3 prostate cancer cells. The cells were incubated with SFN (1-20 µM) and tumor cell growth and proliferative activity were evaluated. Having found a considerable anti-growth, anti-proliferative, and anti-clonogenic influence of SFN on both prostate cancer cell lines, further investigation into possible mechanisms of action were performed by evaluating the cell cycle phases and cell-cycle-regulating proteins. SFN induced a cell cycle arrest at the S- and G2/M-phase in both DU145 and PC3 cells. Elevation of histone H3 and H4 acetylation was also evident in both cell lines following SFN exposure. However, alterations occurring in the Cdk-cyclin axis, modification of the p19 and p27 proteins and changes in CD44v4, v5, and v7 expression because of SFN exposure differed in the two cell lines. SFN, therefore, does exert anti-tumor properties on these two prostate cancer cell lines by histone acetylation and altering the intracellular signaling cascade, but not through the same molecular mechanisms.""","""['Jochen Rutz', 'Sarah Thaler', 'Sebastian Maxeiner', 'Felix K-H Chun', 'Roman A Blaheta']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Int J Mol Sci""","""['Targeting cell cycle machinery as a molecular mechanism of sulforaphane in prostate cancer prevention.', 'Sulforaphane, a Dietary Isothiocyanate, Induces G₂/M Arrest in Cervical Cancer Cells through CyclinB1 Downregulation and GADD45β/CDC2 Association.', 'Chronic Sulforaphane Administration Inhibits Resistance to the mTOR-Inhibitor Everolimus in Bladder Cancer Cells.', 'Chemopreventive activity of sulforaphane.', 'Anticancer Activity of Sulforaphane: The Epigenetic Mechanisms and the Nrf2 Signaling Pathway.', 'Sulforaphane and Its Protective Role in Prostate Cancer: A Mechanistic Approach.', 'Sulforaphane: An emergent anti-cancer stem cell agent.', 'MicroRNAs miR-584-5p and miR-425-3p Are Up-Regulated in Plasma of Colorectal Cancer (CRC) Patients: Targeting with Inhibitor Peptide Nucleic Acids Is Associated with Induction of Apoptosis in Colon Cancer Cell Lines.', 'Targeting Class I Histone Deacetylases in Human Uterine Leiomyosarcoma.', 'Plant-Derived Sulforaphane Suppresses Growth and Proliferation of Drug-Sensitive and Drug-Resistant Bladder Cancer Cell Lines In Vitro.']"""

The aim of this study was to develop predictive models for acute skin toxicity using published risk factors and externally validate the models in patients recruited into the prospective multi-center REQUITE (validating pREdictive models and biomarkers of radiotherapy toxicity to reduce side-effects and improve QUalITy of lifE in cancer survivors) study. Methods: Patient and treatment-related risk factors significantly associated with acute breast radiation toxicity on multivariate analysis were identified in the literature. These predictors were used to develop risk models for acute erythema and acute desquamation (skin loss) in three Radiogenomics Consortium cohorts of patients treated by breast-conserving surgery and whole breast external beam radiotherapy (n = 2,031). The models were externally validated in the REQUITE breast cancer cohort (n = 2,057). Results: The final risk model for acute erythema included BMI, breast size, hypo-fractionation, boost, tamoxifen use and smoking status.

The risk model for acute desquamation, excluding the predictor tamoxifen use, failed to validate in the REQUITE cohort. Conclusions: While most published prediction research in the field has focused on model development, this study reports successful external validation of a predictive model using clinical risk factors for acute erythema following radiotherapy after breast-conserving surgery. This model retained discriminatory power but will benefit from further re-calibration. A similar model to predict acute desquamation failed to validate in the REQUITE cohort.

However, selecting which patients with grade group 2 disease can be safely managed by active surveillance remains controversial. The aim of this study was to evaluate the association of multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging with adverse pathology in the radical prostatectomy specimen of men with favorable risk grade group 2 prostate cancer, which could help select patients for active surveillance.  Materials and methods:   We retrospectively analyzed a cohort of patients with favorable grade group 2 disease who underwent radical prostatectomy between 2010 and 2019. Preoperative multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging was scored as negative (no identifiable lesion), positive (identifiable lesion) or equivocal. We defined a multivariable logistic regression model with multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging score as the predictor and adverse pathology (up staging to T3a/b disease, upgrading to ≥grade group 3 or lymph node invasion) as the outcome, adjusting for preoperative prostate specific antigen, biopsy Gleason grade, clinical stage, and number of negative and positive prostate biopsy cores. Secondary outcomes of biochemical recurrence, grade group upgrading alone and the added value of incorporating multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging data into the nomogram were also investigated.  Results:   We identified 1,117 patients with favorable risk grade group 2 disease who underwent radical prostatectomy. Positive multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging was associated with higher rates of adverse pathology (OR 2.55, 95% CI 1.75-3.40, p <0.0001) and upgrading (OR 3.89, 95% CI 2.00-7.56, p <0.0001). However, as our study included only grade group 2 patients who underwent radical prostatectomy, our cohort may represent a higher risk group than grade group 2 patients as a whole. Adding multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging results to a standard prediction model led to higher net benefit on decision curve analysis. An identifiable lesion on multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging was associated with an increased risk of aggressive pathological features in the radical prostatectomy specimen of patients with favorable risk grade group 2 prostate cancer who were potential active surveillance candidates. This information could be used to inform biopsy strategy, counsel patients on treatment options and guide strategies for those on active surveillance.  Conclusions:   Combining multiple magnetic resonance imaging modalities (multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging) provides a more accurate prediction of the risk presented by prostate cancer than current prediction methods. In this study, positive magnetic resonance imaging results approximately doubled the chances that a patient with favorable risk prostate cancer would be found to have adverse pathology when their prostate was removed. Thus, multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging could help select patients with favorable risk cancer who may be good candidates for active surveillance, and help guide biopsy and surveillance strategies for such patients.""","""['T Stonier', 'A L Tin', 'D D Sjoberg', 'G Jibara', 'A J Vickers', 'S Fine', 'J Eastham']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""J Urol""","""['Selecting Patients with Favorable Risk, Grade Group 2 Prostate Cancer for Active Surveillance-Does Magnetic Resonance Imaging Have a Role?

Methods:   Patients with rare genitourinary malignancies and no prior immune checkpoint inhibitor exposure were enrolled. Patients received nivolumab at 3 mg/kg and ipilimumab at 1 mg/kg intravenously every 3 weeks for 4 doses, and this was followed by 480 mg of nivolumab intravenously every 4 weeks. The primary endpoint was the objective response rate (ORR) by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (version 1.1).  Results:   Fifty-five patients were enrolled at 6 institutions between April 2018 and July 2019 in 3 cohorts: BUTCVH (n = 19), adrenal tumors (n = 18), and other tumors (n = 18).

The ability of TP53 to serve as a prognostic biomarker of PCa has been well studied in Western populations. However, no studies to date have examined the role of TP53 in the disparities of primary hormone-naïve prostate cancer (HNPC) between Chinese and Western populations.  Methods:   We collected prostate tumors and matched normal tissues or blood samples to perform targeted next-generation sequencing of 94 Chinese primary localized HNPC samples, and correlated these genomic profiles with clinical outcomes. The OncoKB knowledge database was used to identify and classify actionable alterations.  Results:   The aberrations of PTEN, CDK12, and SPOP in Chinese HNPC samples were similar to those in the Western samples. However, we demonstrated an association of a high frequency of TP53 alterations (21/94) with a relatively higher percentage of alterations in the Wnt signaling pathway (15/94) in Chinese HNPC. Additionally, we highlighted alterations of LRP1B as accounting for a high proportion of PCa and found more frequent alterations in CDH1 in Chinese PCa. Of these, only CDH1 alteration was associated with rapid biochemical recurrence (BCR). However, we verified that TP53 status was at the core of the genomic alteration landscape in Chinese HNPC with putative driver mutations because of the strong connections with other signaling pathways. The mutually exclusive relationship between alterations in TP53 and Wnt/CTNNB1 further molecularly characterizes subsets of prostate cancers. Moreover, the alteration of KMT2C was more likely to co-occur with TP53 alteration, indicating a more aggressive phenotype of PCa, which was associated with sensitivity to treatment with poly ADT-ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitors.

Its utility in node-positive prostate cancer is restricted due to a lack of controlled studies specifically addressing this subgroup. Herein we report the safety and efficacy of SBRT in this subgroup.  Materials and methods:   In total, 60 patients treated with SBRT to prostate and pelvis were analysed. All patients received neoadjuvant androgen deprivation therapy for at least 6 months and long-term adjuvant hormonal therapy (70% medical and 30% surgical). All patients were treated with daily image-guided rotational intensity-modulated radiotherapy. The dose delivered to the prostate and gross node was 35-37.5 Gy and 25 Gy in five fractions to the elective pelvic nodal region on alternate days. Acute and late toxicities were graded as per Radiation Therapy Oncology Group common toxicity criteria.  Results:   Forty-one (68%) patients had a Gleason score ≥8. The median prostate-specific antigen level at diagnosis was 39 ng/ml. Twenty (33%) patients had common iliac nodal uptake on initial prostate-specific membrane antigen positron emission tomography-computed tomography. After the median follow-up of 30 months, no acute or late Radiation Therapy Oncology Group grade ≥3 gastrointestinal toxicity was noted. Acute grade 2 genitourinary and gastrointestinal toxicities were 8.3% and 11.7%, respectively. Late grade 2 genitourinary and gastrointestinal toxicities were 3.3% and 8.3%, respectively. Late grade 3 genitourinary toxicity was seen in two (3.3%) patients. Three-year overall survival and biochemical failure-free survival was 89% and 77%, respectively.  Conclusion:   SBRT to the prostate and pelvis is safe and efficacious in node-positive prostate cancer even with common iliac nodal involvement (stage M1a).""","""['T Telkhade', 'V Murthy', 'T S Kanala', 'J M Mathew', 'R Phurailatpam', 'S Mokal', 'D Chourasiya', 'G Panigrahi', 'R Krishnatry']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Clin Oncol (R Coll Radiol)""","""['Early Results of Extreme Hypofractionation Using Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy for High-risk, Very High-risk and Node-positive Prostate Cancer.', 'Hypofractionated external beam radiotherapy to boost the prostate with ≥85 Gy/equivalent dose for patients with localised disease at high risk of lymph node involvement: feasibility, tolerance and outcome.', 'Moderately Hypofractionated Radiotherapy in Node-positive Prostate Cancer.', 'Salvage reirradiation for locoregional failure after radiation therapy for prostate cancer: who, when, where and how?', 'Evolution of definitive external beam radiation therapy in the treatment of prostate cancer.', 'Ten-year outcomes of whole-pelvic intensity-modulated radiation therapy for prostate cancer with regional lymph node metastasis.', 'Radiobiological analysis of preliminary results of a phase II study of pelvic hypofractionated and accelerated radiotherapy for high-risk prostate cancer patients.', 'Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy for High-Risk Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Review.']"""

But the pathogenic mechanisms of PDIA4 involved in docetaxel (DTX) resistance in prostate cancer (PCa) are still unknown. Hence, this study was conducted to evaluate the potential effect of PDIA4 on chemoresistance to DTX in PCa cells and to investigate the underlying mechanisms.  Methods:   Two types of DTX-resistant PCa cells, that is, DTX-resistant PC-3 cells (PC-3/DTXR) and C4-2B cells (C4-2B/DTXR) were developed, as well as the parental PC-3 and C4-2B cells were obtained to investigate these issues. Short hairpin RNAs targeting human PDIA4 to knockdown the expression of PDIA4 or PDIA4-expressing adenoviral vectors to overexpress the PDIA4 were transfected into PCa cells to study the underlying mechanisms of PDIA4 involving in PCa DTX resistance.  Results:   Results showed that PDIA4 exhibited a dramatic overexpression in PC-3/DTXR and C4-2B/DTXR cells. Down-regulation of PDIA4 by infecting PC-3/DTXR and C4-2B/DTXR cells with shPDIA4 lentivirus stimulated cell death by prompting apoptosis. Up-regulation of PDIA4 by infecting PC-3 and C4-2B cells with PDIA4-expressing adenovirus showed severer resistance to DTX. In addition, PDIA4 up-regulation induced phosphorylated protein kinase B (Akt) expression, while PDIA4 knockdown significantly inhibited the expression in PCa cells.  Conclusions:   Our study indicates that PDIA4 is a negative regulator of PCa cell apoptosis and plays a critical role in PCa DTX resistance by activating the Akt-signaling pathway. Thereby, it implies that targeting PDIA4 could be a potential adjuvant therapeutic approach against DTX resistance in PCa.""","""['Subo Qian', 'Shun Zhang', 'Yu Wu', 'Yu Ding;Shen;Xinyan Li']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Chemotherapy""","""['Comprehensive Evaluation of Multiple Approaches Targeting ABCB1 to Resensitize Docetaxel-Resistant Prostate Cancer Cell Lines.', 'MiR-129-5p promotes docetaxel resistance in prostate cancer by down-regulating CAMK2N1 expression.', 'Overexpression of claspin promotes docetaxel resistance and is associated with prostate-specific antigen recurrence in prostate cancer.', 'Molecular mechanisms of docetaxel resistance in prostate cancer.', 'Epithelial protein lost in neoplasm (EPLIN) and prostate cancer: lessons learned from the ARCaP model.', 'Protein disulfide-isomerase A4 confers glioblastoma angiogenesis promotion capacity and resistance to anti-angiogenic therapy.', 'Identification of Prognostic and Predictive Biomarkers and Druggable Targets among 205 Antioxidant Genes in 21 Different Tumor Types via Data-Mining.', 'High expression of PDIA4 promotes malignant cell behavior and predicts reduced survival in cervical cancer.']"""

Therefore, different tracers have been used to identify the sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs). The use of isotopic tracers together with radioactivity detectors allowed a much more precise and direct approach to the SLNs. However, not all centres have access to a Nuclear Medicine department hindering sentinel lymph node detection (SLND) and consequently, other markers such as ferromagnetic tracers have been evaluated looking for the same advantages and effectiveness as isotopic tracers. Ferromagnetic tracers have proven their usefulness in other cancer entities such as breast, prostate and thyroid cancer. The objective was to assess the detection and concordance rates between isotopic and ferromagnetic techniques for SLNB in cutaneous melanoma.  Method:   Isotopic SLNB technique and ferromagnetic tracer were compared for cutaneous melanoma in a non-inferiority multicentre prospective study carried out in six Spanish hospitals.  Results:   A total of 60 patients were recruited and 133 lymph nodes removed. The detection rate was slightly higher with ferromagnetic tracer in head-neck and trunk melanomas, and with isotopic tracer in limbs. The patients' and nodes' concordance rates between both techniques for ex vivo samples were 95% and 86% for head-neck and trunk tumours and 97% and 93% for limbs tumours, respectively. The concordance rates for involved nodes were 100% and 88.2% for patients and nodes, respectively.

The authors applied XWAS methods, herein referred to as ""laboratory-wide association study (LWAS)"", to evaluate associations between routinely collected laboratory tests and survival in veterans with prostate cancer.  Methods:   The authors identified 133,878 patients who were diagnosed with prostate cancer between 2000 and 2013 in the Veterans Health Administration using any laboratory tests collected within 6 months of diagnosis (3,345,083 results). Using the LWAS framework, the false-discovery rate was used to test the association between multiple laboratory tests and survival, and these results were validated using training, testing, and validation cohorts.  Results:   A total of 31 laboratory tests associated with survival met stringent LWAS criteria. LWAS confirmed markers of prostate cancer biology (prostate-specific antigen: hazard ratio [HR], 1.07 [95% confidence interval (95% CI), 1.06-1.08]; and alkaline phosphatase: HR, 1.22 [95% CI, 1.20-1.24]) as well laboratory tests of general health (eg, serum albumin: HR, 0.78 [95% CI, 0.76-0.80]; and creatinine: HR, 1.05 [95% CI, 1.03-1.07]) and inflammation (leukocyte count: HR, 1.23 [95% CI, 1.98-1.26]; and erythrocyte sedimentation rate: HR, 1.33 [95% CI, 1.09-1.61]). In addition, the authors derived and validated separate models for patients with localized and advanced disease, identifying 28 laboratory markers and 15 laboratory markers, respectively, in each cohort.  Conclusions:   The authors identified routinely collected laboratory data associated with survival for patients with prostate cancer using LWAS methodologies, including markers of prostate cancer biology, overall health, and inflammation. Broadening consideration of determinants of survival beyond those related to cancer itself could help to inform the design of clinical trials and aid in shared decision making.

Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) remains the treatment of choice for incurable prostate cancer, but majority of patients develop disease recurrence following ADT. There is therefore an urgent need for early detection of treatment resistance.  Methods:   Isogenic androgen-responsive (CWR22Res) and castration-resistant (22Rv1) human prostate cancer cells were implanted into the anterior lobes of the prostate in CD-1 Nu mice to generate prostate orthografts. Castrated mice bearing CWR22Res and 22Rv1 orthografts mimic clinical prostate cancer following acute and chronic ADT, respectively. 18F-Fluciclovine (1-amino-3-fluorocyclobutane-1-carboxylic acid) with a radiochemical purity of > 99% was produced on a FASTlab synthesiser. Ki67 staining in endpoint orthografts was studied. Western blot, quantitative RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing transcriptomic analyses were performed to assess the expression levels of amino acid transporters (including LAT1 and ASCT2, which have been implicated for Fluciclovine uptake). Longitudinal metabolic imaging with 18F-Fluciclovine-based positron emission tomography (PET) was performed to study tumour response following acute and chronic ADT.  Results:   Both immunohistochemistry analysis of endpoint prostate tumours and longitudinal 18F-Fluciclovine imaging revealed tumour heterogeneity, particularly following ADT, with in vivo 18F-Fluciclovine uptake correlating to viable cancer cells in both androgen-proficient and castrated environment. Highlighting tumour subpopulation following ADT, both SUVpeak and coefficient of variation (CoV) values of 18F-Fluciclovine uptake are consistent with tumour heterogeneity revealed by immunohistochemistry. We studied the expression of amino acid transporters (AATs) for 18F-Fluciclovine, namely LAT1 (SLC7A5 and SLC3A2) and ASCT2 (SLC1A5). SLC7A5 and SLC3A2 were expressed at relatively high levels in 22Rv1 castration-resistant orthografts following chronic ADT (modelling clinical castration-resistant disease), while SLC1A5 was preferentially expression in CWR22Res tumours following acute ADT. Additional AATs such as SLC43A2 (LAT4) were shown to be upregulated following chronic ADT by transcriptomic analysis; their role in Fluciclovine uptake warrants investigation.  Conclusion:   We studied in vivo 18F-Fluciclovine uptake in human prostate cancer orthograft models following acute and chronic ADT. 18F-Fluciclovine uptakes highlight tumour heterogeneity that may explain castration resistance and can be exploited as a clinical biomarker.""","""['Gaurav Malviya', 'Rachana Patel', 'Mark Salji', 'Rafael S Martinez', 'Peter Repiscak', 'Ernest Mui', 'Susan Champion', 'Agata Mrowinska', 'Emma Johnson', 'Maha AlRasheedi', 'Sally Pimlott', 'David Lewis', 'Hing Y Leung']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""EJNMMI Res""","""['(14)CFluciclovine (alias anti-(14)CFACBC) uptake and ASCT2 expression in castration-resistant prostate cancer cells.', 'Correlation between 18F-1-amino-3-fluorocyclobutane-1-carboxylic acid (18F-fluciclovine) uptake and expression of alanine-serine-cysteine-transporter 2 (ASCT2) and L-type amino acid transporter 1 (LAT1) in primary prostate cancer.', 'Impact of 18F-fluciclovine PET/CT on plans for androgen deprivation therapy in patients with biochemical recurrence of prostate cancer: data analysis from two prospective clinical trials.', 'EAU guidelines on prostate cancer.

Objective:   To evaluate regional adoption of genomic testing for prostate cancer and understand common trajectories of uptake shared by regions.  Design, setting, and participants:   This dynamic cohort study of patients diagnosed with prostate cancer used administrative claims from Blue Cross Blue Shield Axis, the largest source of commercial health insurance in the US, to characterize temporal trends in the use of commercial, tissue-based genomic testing and calculate the proportion of tested patients at the hospital referral region (HRR) level. Eligible patients from July 1, 2012, through June 30, 2018, were those aged 40 to 89 years with prostate cancer diagnosed from July 1, 2012, through June 30, 2018.  Main outcomes and measures:   Group-based trajectory modeling was used to classify regions according to discrete trajectories of adoption of commercial, tissue-based genomic testing for prostate cancer. Across regions with distinct trajectories, HRR-level sociodemographic and health care contextual characteristics were compared, using data previously calculated among Medicare beneficiaries.  Results:   A total of 92 418 men with prostate cancer who met inclusion criteria were identified; the median (interquartile range) age at diagnosis was 60 (56-63) years. Overall, the proportion of patients who received genomic testing increased from 0.8% in July 2012 to June 2013 to 11.3% in July 2017 to June 2018. Trajectory modeling identified 5 distinct regional trajectories of genomic testing adoption. Although less than 1% of patients in each group were tested at baseline, group 1 (lowest adoption) increased to 4.0%. Groups 2 (7.8%), 3 (14.6%), and 4 (17.3%) experienced more modest growth, while in group 5 (highest adoption), use increased to 33.8% of patients tested from June 2017 to July 2018.

Objective:   to assess the evolution of urinary symptoms from preoperative to 12 months after robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy.  Methods:   data was collected from 998 patients who underwent robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy. Demographic data, preoperative and postoperative information on patients were documented. The ICIQ and IPSS questionnaires were also applied preoperatively and after 1, 3, 6 and 12 months after the operation. Results: Out of 998 patients, 257 correctly completed all questionnaires. The mean age of the patients was 60 ± 0.74 years. We found that the total IPSS increased initially and at 6 months after the operation, it was already lower than the initial preoperative value (7.76 at 6 months vs. 9.90 preoperative, p <0.001), being that questions regarding voiding symptoms were the first to improve followed by the questions regarding post micturition and storage symptoms. As for the ICIQ variables, there was an increase with radical prostatectomy and none of them returned to the preoperative level (p<0.001).  Conclusions:   robotic assisted radical prostatectomy causes, at first, a worsening of urinary symptoms in the lower tract with subsequent recovery. Recovery begins with voiding symptoms, followed by post micturition and storage symptoms.

Recently, miR-188-5p, a small noncoding RNA, has been implicated in various types of cancer such as nasopharyngeal carcinoma, oral squamous cell carcinoma, liver cancer, and prostate cancer. However, the effect of miR-188-5p on GBC remains unclear. Here, we demonstrated that miR-188-5p was downregulated in GBC tissues, and downregulation of miR-188-5p correlated with larger tumor size, lymph node metastasis, and extensive metastasis. In addition, the overall survival time of patients with higher miR-188-5p expression was significantly longer than that of patients with low-miR-188-5p expression. Moreover, downregulation of miR-188-5p promoted the proliferation, migration, and invasion of GBC cells, while its overexpression inhibited cell invasion and induced cell apoptosis, and arrested GBC growth in vivo. Importantly, miR-188-5p-dependent tumorigenesis was correlated with Wnt/β-catenin signaling and p-38/JNK signaling. In conclusion, miR-188-5p plays a direct role in GBC tumorigenesis. Our study suggests that miR-188-5p could serve as a novel diagnosis marker and therapeutic target in GBC.""","""['Xiang-Lu Li', 'Shi-Zong Li', 'Chang-Xiong Wu', 'Xue-Hua Xing']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Kaohsiung J Med Sci""","""['Long non-coding RNA PVT1 promotes tumor progression by regulating the miR-143/HK2 axis in gallbladder cancer.', 'MicroRNA-30a-5p inhibits gallbladder cancer cell proliferation, migration and metastasis by targeting E2F7.', 'MiR-143-5p Deficiency Triggers EMT and Metastasis by Targeting HIF-1α in Gallbladder Cancer.', 'Deciphering the roles of miR-16-5p in malignant solid tumors.', 'Reiterating the Emergence of Noncoding RNAs as Regulators of the Critical Hallmarks of Gall Bladder Cancer.', 'Non-coding RNAs as potential biomarkers of gallbladder cancer.']"""

Thus, a meta-analysis was performed to determine whether marital status can influence the prognosis in patients with prostate cancer.  Materials and methods:   Literature search of the MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Embase and Cochrane Library databases was conducted to identify eligible studies published before April 2020. Multivariate adjusted risk estimates and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were extracted and calculated using the random effects model.  Results:   A total of 11 observational studies comprising 1,457,799 patients diagnosed with prostate cancer were identified. Results indicated that unmarried status (separated, divorced, widowed or never married) was associated with an increased risk of all-cause mortality (hazard ratio, HR = 1.39, 95% CI: 1.30-1.50; P < .001; I2 = 92.2%) compared with married status, especially for divorced and never-married patients. Similarly, being unmarried had an elevated risk of cancer-specific mortality (HR = 1.29, 95% CI: 1.17-1.41; P < .001; I2 = 82.5%) in patients with prostate cancer. A significant difference was also observed between unmarried status and shorter overall survival (HR = 1.37, 95% CI: 1.20-1.56; P < .001; I2 = 94.5%).  Conclusion:   Results demonstrated that unmarried status is associated with a worse prognosis regarding mortality and survival in patients diagnosed with prostate cancer, particularly in divorced and never-married patients. Hence, further research should explore the potential mechanisms which can benefit the development of novel, more personalised management methods for unmarried patients with prostate cancer.""","""['Zhenlang Guo', 'Chiming Gu', 'Siyi Li', 'Shu Gan', 'Yuan Li', 'Songtao Xiang', 'Leiliang Gong', 'Shusheng Wang']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Urol J""","""['The association of marital status and mortality among men with early-stage prostate cancer treated with radical prostatectomy: insight into post-prostatectomy survival strategies.', 'Effects of marital status on survival of medullary thyroid cancer stratified by age.', 'Assessment of Modifiable Factors for the Association of Marital Status With Cancer-Specific Survival.', 'Marital Status and Risk of Physical Frailty: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.', 'Periodontal disease and the risk of prostate cancer: a meta-analysis of cohort studies.', 'Marital status and perceived stress in men with advanced prostate cancer: A randomized-controlled trial of cognitive behavioral stress management.', 'Gleason score, surgical and distant metastasis are associated with cancer-specific survival and overall survival in middle aged high-risk prostate cancer: A population-based study.', 'Estimating the risk of developing secondary hematologic malignancies in patients with T1/T2 prostate cancer undergoing diverse treatment modalities: A large population-based study.']"""

This study aimed at evaluating the possible anticancer effect of saffron stigma aqueous extract on human prostate cancer (PC3) and mouse fibroblast cells (L929) as non-cancerous control cells.  Materials and methods:   Saffron stigma aqueous extract at concentrations of 100, 200, 400, 600, 800, 1600 and 3200 μg/mL were prepared. PC3 and L929 cells were incubated with different concentrations of saffron extracts in different time intervals (24, 48, 72, 96 and 144 hours). MTT assay was used for each cell line to investigate the cytotoxic effect of saffron. Morphological alterations were also observed under light inverted microscope.  Results:   In fibroblast cell line after 24 hours, Saffron extract did not affect significantly the normal cells and they were intact in morphologic view. After 96 hours in the cells with highest concentration (1600 μg/mL), cell death and cellular form changes as well as severe granulation was observed. In prostate cell line after 24 hours, the only changes were observed in cells with the concentration of 1600 μg/mL. The cells were granulated and the form of the cells were spherule. After 72 hours, in group with the concentration of 1600 μg/mL, severe granulation was observed and the cell count decreased and some cells were dead.

It can affect different organs (central nervous system, salivary glands, thyroid, lungs, pancreas, bile ducts, liver, digestive tract, kidneys, prostate, etc.) with symptoms depending on the organ that is affected. It is more common in men older than 50 years of age. Its incidence and prevalence are poorly known because it is an uncommon disease. It is most common in Asia, accounting for only 20-30% of PAI in the Western world. Diagnosis is based on histological examination which shows dense lymphoplasmocytic infiltration in the organ affected associated with IgG4-positive plasma cells (immunohistochemistry), organ fibrosis and obliterating venulitis, all this in the context of increased serum IgG4 levels in more than 80% of cases. Patients are sensitive to corticosteroid therapy, with a high risk of relapse after discontinuation of corticosteroid therapy. This leads to the use of immunomodulators, mainly: thiopurines (azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine), methotrexate and more recently rituximab, which can also be used as induction therapy. Given recent advances, accurate histological and clinical criteria are currently known to limit inappropriate management such as surgery. However, knowledge gaps remain concerning: pathophysiology, identification of specific biomarkers other than IgG4, natural history of the disease and long-term cancer risk assessment, performances of diagnostic tools such as endoscopic ultrasound-guided pancreatic biopsy.

MRF has shown promise in improving the diagnosis of clinically significant prostate cancer but requires further validation as part of a prostate multiparametric (mp) MRI protocol. mpMRI protocol mandates the inclusion of dynamic contrast enhanced (DCE) imaging, known for its significant T1 shortening effect. MRF could be used to measure both pre- and post-contrast T1 values, but its utility must be assessed. In this proof-of-concept study, we sought to evaluate the variation in MRF T1 measurements post gadolinium-based contrast agent (GBCA) injection and the utility of such T1 measurements to differentiate peripheral and transition zone tumours from normal prostatic tissue. We found that the T1 variation in all tissues increased considerably post-GBCA following the expected significant T1 shortening effect, compromising the ability of MRF T1 to identify transition zone lesions. We, therefore, recommend performing MRF T1 prior to DCE imaging to maintain its benefit for improving detection of both peripheral and transition zone lesions while reducing additional scanning time. Demonstrating the effect of GBCA on MRF T1 relaxometry in patients also paves the way for future clinical studies investigating the added value of post-GBCA MRF in PCa, including its dynamic analysis as in DCE-MRF.""","""['Nikita Sushentsev', 'Joshua D Kaggie', 'Guido Buonincontri', 'Rolf F Schulte', 'Martin J Graves', 'Vincent J Gnanapragasam', 'Tristan Barrett']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Sci Rep""","""['MR fingerprinting of the prostate.', 'Magnetic resonance fingerprinting in prostate cancer before and after contrast enhancement.', 'Reproducibility of magnetic resonance fingerprinting-based T1 mapping of the healthy prostate at 1.5 and 3.0 T: A proof-of-concept study.', 'Feasibility of Dynamic Contrast-Enhanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging Using Low-Dose Gadolinium: Comparative Performance With Standard Dose in Prostate Cancer Diagnosis.', 'Multiparametric MRI in detection and staging of prostate cancer.', 'Magnetic Resonance Fingerprinting: A Review of Clinical Applications.', 'Multicenter Repeatability and Reproducibility of MR Fingerprinting in Phantoms and in Prostatic Tissue.', 'MR fingerprinting of the prostate.', 'Magnetic resonance fingerprinting in prostate cancer before and after contrast enhancement.', 'Accelerated 3D whole-brain T1, T2, and proton density mapping: feasibility for clinical glioma MR imaging.']"""

In treating the clinically localized PC, the radical prostatectomy is regarded as a gold standard, but it is associated with syndromes as urinary incontinence (UI), which can have a significant impact on patients' quality of life. Nurse takes responsibility in the management of the UI for their convenience compared with doctors to contact with patients and build better trust relationships with survivals. However, most of the studies focus on the physiological level, the psychological nursing intervention research is less. The purpose of the trial is to introduce a psychological intervention program and to study its effects on anxiety and depression after prostatectomy in IU patients.  Methods:   This is a single-center randomized controlled trial that was authorized by Ethics Committee of the First People's Hospital of Chenzhou City (2020054). One hundred participants who undergo radical prostatectomy are analyzed. Inclusion criteria are the following: PC is diagnosed based on histological results; Participants in the study voluntarily sign the informed consent table; Severe UI after extubation; Patients with postoperative UI do not receive any drug treatment. Exclusion criteria are the followings: patients with the history of prostate operation; patients with the history of severe renal and liver malignancy; UI caused by reasons other than prostatectomy. The main outcomes are the degree of anxiety and depression 2 months after urinary catheter is removed. The secondary outcomes are the quality of life 2 months after urinary catheter is removed. All data are collected and analyzed by the Social Science software version 21.0 (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL) program.  Results:   The relevant indexes of severe UI patients are compared in the table.

Patients and methods:   Twenty-two patients with the mean age of 66.6 ± 10.1 years were studied using 99mTc-PSMA SPECT/CT and 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT, with less than 7 days interval between the 2 imaging procedures. Whole-body PET/CT was done 60 minutes after IV injection of 185 MBq (5 mCi) of 68Ga-PSMA. 99mTc-PSMA SPECT/CT was performed 3 hours after IV injection of 555 to 740 MBq (15-20 mCi) of 99mTc-PSMA. The images of each modality were interpreted independently, and the results were compared according to patient-based as well as region-based analyses.  Results:   In patient-based evaluation, both 99mTc-PSMA SPECT/CT and 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT scans were positive in 95.45% (21/22). In region-based evaluation, 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT detected 53 regions (median of 2 regions per patient; range, 0-5), whereas 43 (median of 2 regions per patient; range, 0-5) were detected by 99mTc-PSMA SPECT/CT. Most of these differences could be explained by lower detection rate of 99mTc-PSMA SPECT/CT in prostate bed (n = 6). PET/CT detected more involved regions than SPECT/CT (P = 0.007), whereas similar frequency of extraprostatic lesions were diagnosed in both modalities (P = 0.102). Significant correlation was also demonstrated between serum prostate-specific antigen level and imaging parameters of disease extension detected by 2 modalities.

Background:   The protective effect of DVF during L-TME on pelvic autonomic nerves and postoperative urogenital function remains controversial.  Methods:   Between August 26, 2015 and July 18, 2019, 253 male patients with cT1-4 (T1-2 for anterior wall) N0-2M0 rectal cancer from 11 institutions were enrolled, and randomly assigned to L-TME with DVF preservation (Exp-group, n = 123) or resection procedures (Con-group, n = 130). Urinary function was assessed by residual urine volume, maximal flow rate, and International Prostate Symptom Score; sexual function was assessed by 5-item version of the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF-5) and ejaculation grading.  Results:   The Exp-group patients showed a lower urinary dysfunction rate (6.8% vs 25.4%, P = 0.003), higher maximal flow rate (16.25 ± 8.02 vs 12.40 ± 7.05 mL/s, P = 0.007), and lower International Prostate Symptom Score (6.55 ± 5.86 vs 8.57 ± 5.85, P = 0.026) than the Con-group patients at 2 weeks after surgery.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate dosimetric parameters possibly contributing to stricture development, including dose to bladder base and D2cc(Gy) within 10 mm of prostatic urethra (D2cc 10 mm), which has, so far, not been reported in the literature.  Methods and materials:   Patients developing urethral stricture, and matched controls, were identified from a prospective database of those receiving 46 Gy in 23 fractions of EBRT, followed by a single 15 Gy HDR brachytherapy dose. Patients had locally advanced, high- and intermediate-risk prostate cancer. Brachytherapy treatment planning parameters (planning target volume (PTV) size (cm 3), V110(%) bladder base, D2cc 10mm, number of HDR catheters, number of source dwell positions, and total source dwell time within 10 mm of the prostatic urethra) were analyzed to determine potential risk factors for urethral stricture.  Results:   Seventy-two patients were treated, 22 of whom developed a urethral stricture. Univariate logistic regression performed on the planning parameters identified increased PTV size and D2cc 10 mm, with decreased V110(%) bladder base as risk factors for stricture formation.  Conclusions:   It is suggested that PTV size, V110(%) bladder base, and D2cc 10mm are predictive of urethral stricture formation following EBRT and brachytherapy to the prostate. This study demonstrates the importance of minimizing high dwell times and hot spots close to organs at risk and also the correction of any craniocaudal movement of catheters to avoid potential hot spots in the bulbomembranous urethra where there may be increased dose sensitivity.""","""['Nicki Groom', 'Yatman Tsang', 'Gerry Lowe', 'Peter Hoskin']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Brachytherapy""","""['Acute genitourinary toxicity after high dose rate (HDR) brachytherapy combined with hypofractionated external-beam radiation therapy for localized prostate cancer: Second analysis to determine the correlation between the urethral dose in HDR brachytherapy and the severity of acute genitourinary toxicity.', 'Acute genitourinary toxicity after high-dose-rate (HDR) brachytherapy combined with hypofractionated external-beam radiation therapy for localized prostate cancer: correlation between the urethral dose in HDR brachytherapy and the severity of acute genitourinary toxicity.', 'A pilot study on dosimetric and radiomics analysis of urethral strictures following HDR brachytherapy as monotherapy for localized prostate cancer.', 'Use of three-dimensional radiation therapy planning tools and intraoperative ultrasound to evaluate high dose rate prostate brachytherapy implants.', 'Prostate cancer radiation and urethral strictures: a systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Randomised controlled trial to investigate the effectiveness of the symptom management after radiotherapy (SMaRT) group intervention to ameliorate lower urinary tract symptoms in men treated for prostate cancer.']"""

The P2X4 receptor (P2X4R) is the most ubiquitously expressed P2X receptor in mammals and is positively associated with tumorigenesis in many cancer types. However, its involvement in PCa progression is less understood. We hypothesized that P2X4R activity enhanced tumour formation by PCa cells. We showed that P2X4R was the most highly expressed, functional P2 receptor in these cells using quantitative reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) and a calcium influx assay. The effect of inhibiting P2X4R on PCa (PC3 and C4-2B4 cells) viability, proliferation, migration, invasion, and apoptosis were examined using the selective P2XR4 antagonists 5-BDBD and PSB-12062. The results demonstrated that inhibiting P2X4R impaired the growth and mobility of PCa cells but not apoptosis. In BALB/c immunocompromised nude mice inoculated with human PC3 cells subcutaneously, 5-BDBD showed anti-tumourigenic effects. Finally, a retrospective analysis of P2RX4 expression in clinical datasets (GDS1439, GDS1746, and GDS3289) suggested that P2X4R was positively associated with PCa malignancy. These studies suggest that P2X4R has a role in enhancing PCa tumour formation and is a clinically targetable candidate for which inhibitors are already available and have the potential to suppress disease progression.""","""['Jiepei He', 'Yuhan Zhou', 'Hector M Arredondo Carrera', 'Alexandria Sprules', 'Ramona Neagu', 'Sayyed Amin Zarkesh', 'Colby Eaton', 'Jian Luo', 'Alison Gartland', 'Ning Wang']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Cells""","""['P2X4 purinergic receptors offer a therapeutic target for aggressive prostate cancer.', 'Diabetes-induced Neuropathic Mechanical Hyperalgesia Depends on P2X4 Receptor Activation in Dorsal Root Ganglia.', 'P2X4R promotes airway remodeling by acting on the phenotype switching of bronchial smooth muscle cells in rats.', 'The role of P2X4 receptors in chronic pain: A potential pharmacological target.', 'Resolving the Ionotropic P2X4 Receptor Mystery Points Towards a New Therapeutic Target for Cardiovascular Diseases.', 'Therapeutic targeting of P2X4 receptor and mitochondrial metabolism in clear cell renal carcinoma models.', 'P2X1 and P2X7 Receptor Overexpression Is a Negative Predictor of Survival in Muscle-Invasive Bladder Cancer.', 'Purinergic signaling: Diverse effects and therapeutic potential in cancer.', 'Construction of a novel cuproptosis-related gene signature for predicting prognosis and estimating tumor immune microenvironment status in papillary thyroid carcinoma.', 'The P2 purinoceptors in prostate cancer.']"""

There is no effective treatment for metastatic prostate cancer. Regucalcin has been shown to contribute as a suppressor in various types of human cancers. In the present study, furthermore, we investigate an involvement of regucalcin in suppression of prostate cancer. Regucalcin expression was compared in 131 primary tumor tissues and 19 metastatic tumor tissues in prostate cancer patients. Regucalcin expression in the metastatic tumor was found to be reduced as compared with that in primary tumor. The progression-free survival rate was prolonged in patients with a higher regucalcin expression. Translationally, overexpression of regucalcin in bone metastatic human prostate cancer PC-3 and DU-145 cells suppressed colony formation and cell growth in vitro. Mechanistically, overexpressed regucalcin enhanced the levels of p53, Rb, and p21, and decreased the levels of Ras, PI3 kinase, Akt, and mitogen-activated protein kinase, leading to suppression of cell growth. Furthermore, higher regucalcin expression suppressed the levels of nuclear factor-κB p65, β-catenin, and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3, which regulate a transcription activity.

MER and AXL upregulation was more efficiently induced by a vaccine containing Imiquimod than by a poly(I:C)-containing vaccine. Interestingly, MER expression was found on monocyte-derived DC, and was dependent on IL-10. TAM blockade improved Imiquimod-induced DC activation in vitro and in vivo, resulting in increased vaccine-induced T-cell responses, which were further reinforced by concomitant IL-10 inhibition. In different tumor models, a triple therapy (including vaccination, TAM inhibition and IL-10 blockade) provided the strongest therapeutic effect, associated with enhanced T-cell immunity and enhanced CD8+ T cell tumor infiltration. Finally, MER levels in DC used for vaccination in cancer patients correlated with IL-10 expression, showing an inverse association with vaccine-induced clinical response.

Peripheral blood samples were obtained from five healthy donors and patients with localized prostate cancer (26 cases), metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (mHSPC, 10 cases), and metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC, 28 cases). CTC recovery rate and purity (enriched CTCs/total cells) were evaluated according to cancer stage. The areas under the curves of the six gene expressions were used to evaluate whether multigene models could identify mHSPC or mCRPC. The number of CTCs and their purity increased at more advanced cancer stages. In mHSPC/mCRPC cases, the specimens had an average of 27.5 CTCs/mL blood, which was 4.2 × higher than the isolation rate for localized disease. The CTC purity increased from 2.1% for localized disease to 3.8% for mHSPC and 6.7% for mCRPC, with increased CTC expression of the genes encoding prostate-specific antigen (PSA), prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA), and cytokeratin 19 (KRT19). All disease stages exhibited expression of the genes encoding androgen receptor (AR) and epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM), although expression of the AR-V7 variant was relatively rare.

Thus, it is critical to understand genomic drivers of cancer and identify potential mutational commonalities across tumors originating at diverse anatomical sites. Large-scale cancer genomics initiatives, such as TCGA, ICGC and GENIE have enabled the analysis of thousands of tumour genomes. Our goal was to identify new cancer-causing mutations that may be common across tumour sites using mutational and gene expression profiles. Genomic and transcriptomic data from breast, ovarian, and prostate cancers were aggregated and analysed using differential gene expression methods to identify the effect of specific mutations on the expression of multiple genes. Mutated genes associated with the most differentially expressed genes were considered to be novel candidates for driver mutations, and were validated through literature mining, pathway analysis and clinical data investigation. Our driver selection method successfully identified 116 probable novel cancer-causing genes, with 4 discovered in patients having no alterations in any known driver genes: MXRA5, OBSCN, RYR1, and TG. The candidate genes previously not officially classified as cancer-causing showed enrichment in cancer pathways and in cancer diseases. They also matched expectations pertaining to properties of cancer genes, for instance, showing larger gene and protein lengths, and having mutation patterns suggesting oncogenic or tumor suppressor properties. Our approach allows for the identification of novel putative driver genes that are common across cancer sites using an unbiased approach without any a priori knowledge on pathways or gene interactions and is therefore an agnostic approach to the identification of putative common driver genes acting at multiple cancer sites.""","""['Houriiyah Tegally', 'Kevin H Kensler', 'Zahra Mungloo-Dilmohamud', 'Anisah W Ghoorah', 'Timothy R Rebbeck', 'Shakuntala Baichoo']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Identification of candidate cancer drivers by integrative Epi-DNA and Gene Expression (iEDGE) data analysis.', 'Integration of somatic mutation, expression and functional data reveals potential driver genes predictive of breast cancer survival.', 'Identification of druggable cancer driver genes amplified across TCGA datasets.', 'Untangling a complex web: Computational analyses of tumor molecular profiles to decode driver mechanisms.', 'Cancer driver mutations: predictions and reality.', 'Deciphering Common Traits of Breast and Ovarian Cancer Stem Cells and Possible Therapeutic Approaches.']"""

Therefore, federated learning (FL) becomes a promising technique to learn from multi-source decentralized data with privacy preservation. However, the cross-client variation problem in medical image data would be the bottleneck in practice. In this paper, we propose a variation-aware federated learning (VAFL) framework, where the variations among clients are minimized by transforming the images of all clients onto a common image space. We first select one client with the lowest data complexity to define the target image space and synthesize a collection of images through a privacy-preserving generative adversarial network, called PPWGAN-GP. Then, a subset of those synthesized images, which effectively capture the characteristics of the raw images and are sufficiently distinct from any raw image, is automatically selected for sharing with other clients. For each client, a modified CycleGAN is applied to translate its raw images to the target image space defined by the shared synthesized images. In this way, the cross-client variation problem is addressed with privacy preservation. We apply the framework for automated classification of clinically significant prostate cancer and evaluate it using multi-source decentralized apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) image data. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed VAFL framework stably outperforms the current horizontal FL framework. As VAFL is independent of deep learning architectures for classification, we believe that the proposed framework is widely applicable to other medical image classification tasks.""","""['Zengqiang Yan', 'Jeffry Wicaksana', 'Zhiwei Wang', 'Xin Yang', 'Kwang-Ting Cheng']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""IEEE J Biomed Health Inform""","""['Federated Learning for Medical Image Analysis with Deep Neural Networks.', 'Customized Federated Learning for Multi-Source Decentralized Medical Image Classification.', 'Federated learning with hyper-network-a case study on whole slide image analysis.', 'Federated Multi-Task Learning for Joint Diagnosis of Multiple Mental Disorders on MRI Scans.', 'Learning From Others Without Sacrificing Privacy: Simulation Comparing Centralized and Federated Machine Learning on Mobile Health Data.', 'Federated Learning for Medical Image Analysis with Deep Neural Networks.', 'Enhancing cancer differentiation with synthetic MRI examinations via generative models: a systematic review.', 'A COVID-19 Auxiliary Diagnosis Based on Federated Learning and Blockchain.', 'SplitAVG: A Heterogeneity-Aware Federated Deep Learning Method for Medical Imaging.', 'Rebirth of Distributed AI-A Review of eHealth Research.']"""

Hence, we investigated the prognostic value of automated circulating tumor cell (CTC) and tumor-derived extracellular vesicle (tdEV) enumeration and their dynamics, in patients with mCRPC in the context of the initiation of treatment with ARSi. Furthermore, we hypothesize that CTC phenotypic heterogeneity might serve as a measurable biomarker under these circumstances.  Methods:   Using an image analysis tool, we reanalyzed all CellSearch images previously acquired in the context of a prospective, multicenter clinical study for patients with mCRPC (n = 170) starting a new line of ARSi, for CTC and tdEV detection and enumeration. CTC (n = 19 129) phenotypic diversity was quantified by the Shannon index (SI). Progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were compared between groups of patients stratified according to CTC, tdEV, and SI levels.  Results:   Automated CTC enumeration provided similar clinical prognostication compared with operator-based counts. Patients demonstrating high CTC phenotypic heterogeneity before therapy had a shorter median PFS (4.82 vs. 8.49 months, HR 1.79; P = 0.03) and OS (12.6 months vs. not reached, HR 2.32; P = 0.03), compared to patients with low diversity, irrespective of CTC level. Multivariable analysis showed how the prognostic value of the baseline SI was lost by pretreatment chemotherapy status, CTC counts, and PSA levels.  Conclusions:   Automated CTC counts are a reliable substitute for reviewer-based enumeration, as they are equally informative for prognosis assessment in patients with mCRPC.

Defining which transcription factor (TF) and coregulators are altered and combine to become oncogenic drivers remains a challenge, in part because of the multitude of TFs and coregulators and the diverse genomic space on which they function. The current study was undertaken to identify which TFs and coregulators are commonly altered in PCa. We generated unique lists of TFs (n = 2662), coactivators (COA; n = 766); corepressors (COR; n = 599); mixed function coregulators (MIXED; n = 511), and to address the challenge of defining how these genes are altered we tested how expression, copy number alterations and mutation status varied across seven prostate cancer (PCa) cohorts (three of localized and four advanced disease). Testing of significant changes was undertaken by bootstrapping approaches and the most significant changes were identified. For one commonly and significantly altered gene were stably knocked-down expression and undertook cell biology experiments and RNA-Seq to identify differentially altered gene networks and their association with PCa progression risks. COAS, CORS, MIXED and TFs all displayed significant down-regulated expression (q.value < 0.1) and correlated with protein expression (r 0.4-0.55). In localized PCa, stringent expression filtering identified commonly altered TFs and coregulator genes, including well-established (e.g. ERG) and underexplored (e.g. PPARGC1A, encodes PGC1α). Reduced PPARGC1A expression significantly associated with worse disease-free survival in two cohorts of localized PCa. Stable PGC1α knockdown in LNCaP cells increased growth rates and invasiveness and RNA-Seq revealed a profound basal impact on gene expression (~ 2300 genes; FDR < 0.05, logFC > 1.5), but only modestly impacted PPARγ responses. GSEA analyses of the PGC1α transcriptome revealed that it significantly altered the AR-dependent transcriptome, and was enriched for epigenetic modifiers. PGC1α-dependent genes were overlapped with PGC1α-ChIP-Seq genes and significantly associated in TCGA with higher grade tumors and worse disease-free survival. These methods and data demonstrate an approach to identify cancer-driver coregulators in cancer, and that PGC1α expression is clinically significant yet underexplored coregulator in aggressive early stage PCa.""","""['Manjunath Siddappa', 'Sajad A Wani', 'Mark D Long', 'Damien A Leach', 'Ewy A Mathé', 'Charlotte L Bevan', 'Moray J Campbell']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Sci Rep""","""['Nuclear Receptor Coregulators in Hormone-Dependent Cancers.', 'The miR-96 and RARγ signaling axis governs androgen signaling and prostate cancer progression.', 'Integrative analysis of AR-mediated transcriptional regulatory network reveals IRF1 as an inhibitor of prostate cancer progression.', 'Identification of a candidate prognostic gene signature by transcriptome analysis of matched pre- and post-treatment prostatic biopsies from patients with advanced prostate cancer.', 'Transcription networks rewire gene repertoire to coordinate cellular reprograming in prostate cancer.', 'African American Prostate Cancer Displays Quantitatively Distinct Vitamin D Receptor Cistrome-transcriptome Relationships Regulated by BAZ1A.', 'Recent advances in prostate cancer: WNT signaling, chromatin regulation, and transcriptional coregulators.', 'Systematic Investigation of the Diagnostic and Prognostic Impact of LINC01087 in Human Cancers.', 'Genomic Insights into Non-steroidal Nuclear Receptors in Prostate and Breast Cancer.', 'Nuclear Receptor Coregulators in Hormone-Dependent Cancers.']"""

In this study, we found that activating mutation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) or loss of phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN) function, highly frequent events in human cancer, confers ferroptosis resistance in cancer cells, and that inhibition of the PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling axis sensitizes cancer cells to ferroptosis induction. Mechanistically, this resistance requires sustained activation of mTORC1 and the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR)C1-dependent induction of sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP1), a central transcription factor regulating lipid metabolism. Furthermore, stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 (SCD1), a transcriptional target of SREBP1, mediates the ferroptosis-suppressing activity of SREBP1 by producing monounsaturated fatty acids. Genetic or pharmacologic ablation of SREBP1 or SCD1 sensitized ferroptosis in cancer cells with PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway mutation. Conversely, ectopic expression of SREPB1 or SCD1 restored ferroptosis resistance in these cells, even when mTORC1 was inhibited. In xenograft mouse models for PI3K-mutated breast cancer and PTEN-defective prostate cancer, the combination of mTORC1 inhibition with ferroptosis induction resulted in near-complete tumor regression. In conclusion, hyperactive mutation of PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling protects cancer cells from oxidative stress and ferroptotic death through SREBP1/SCD1-mediated lipogenesis, and combination of mTORC1 inhibition with ferroptosis induction shows therapeutic promise in preclinical models.""","""['Junmei Yi', 'Jiajun Zhu', 'Jiao Wu', 'Craig B Thompson', 'Xuejun Jiang']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A""","""['Sorafenib kills liver cancer cells by disrupting SCD1-mediated synthesis of monounsaturated fatty acids via the ATP-AMPK-mTOR-SREBP1 signaling pathway.', 'Aspirin promotes RSL3-induced ferroptosis by suppressing mTOR/SREBP-1/SCD1-mediated lipogenesis in PIK3CA-mutatnt colorectal cancer.', 'TGF-β1 promotes SCD1 expression via the PI3K-Akt-mTOR-SREBP1 signaling pathway in lung fibroblasts.', 'Discrete signaling mechanisms of mTORC1 and mTORC2: Connected yet apart in cellular and molecular aspects.', 'Targeting the translational apparatus to improve leukemia therapy: roles of the PI3K/PTEN/Akt/mTOR pathway.', 'The therapeutic potential of targeting regulated non-apoptotic cell death.', 'Atherosclerosis, Diabetes Mellitus, and Cancer: Common Epidemiology, Shared Mechanisms, and Future Management.', 'Maternal Vitamin D and Inulin Supplementation in Oxidized Oil Diet Improves Growth Performance and Hepatic Innate Immunity in Offspring Mice.', 'A Cell Cycle-Dependent Ferroptosis Sensitivity Switch Governed by EMP2.', 'Autophagy mediates an amplification loop during ferroptosis.']"""

Methods:   Ninety-six patients undergoing radical retropubic prostatectomy with propofol/remifentanil anaesthesia were randomised into one of four groups to receive remifentanil guided by one of three nociception monitoring devices (surgical pleth index [SPI], pupillary pain index [PPI], or nociception level [NOL]) or by clinical judgement (control). Intraoperative remifentanil requirement was the primary endpoint, whereas recovery parameters and stress hormone levels were secondary endpoints.  Results:   The mean [95% confidence interval {CI}] remifentanil administration rate differed between the groups: control 0.34 (0.32-0.37), SPI 0.46 (0.38-0.55), PPI 0.07 (0.06-0.08), and NOL 0.16 (0.12-0.21) μg kg-1 min-1(P<0.001).

In cancer, several miRNAs are upregulated and play crucial roles in tumorigenesis, making the inhibition of these oncomiRs an interesting therapeutic approach. This can be achieved by directly complementary single-stranded anti-miRNA oligonucleotides (antimiRs). A major bottleneck in antimiR therapy, however, is their efficient delivery. The nanoparticle formation with polyethylenimine (PEI) may be particularly promising, based on the PEI's ability to electrostatically interact with oligonucleotides. This leads to their protection and supports delivery. In the present study, we explore for the first time PEI for antimiR formulation and delivery. We use the branched low molecular weight PEI F25-LMW for the complexation of different antimiRs, and analyse tumor- and metastasis-inhibitory effects of PEI/antimiR complexes in different tumor models.  Results:   In prostate carcinoma, transfection of antimiRs against miR-375 and miR-141 leads to tumor cell inhibition in 2D- and 3D-models. More importantly, an in vivo tumor therapy study in prostate carcinoma xenografts reveals anti-tumor effects of the PEI/antimiR complexes. In advanced melanoma and metastasis, we identify by a microRNA screen miR-150 as a particularly relevant oncomiR candidate, and validate this result in vitro and in vivo. Again, the systemic application of PEI/antimiR complexes inhibiting this miRNA, or the previously described antimiR-638, leads to profound tumor growth inhibition. These effects are associated with the upregulation of direct miRNA target genes. In a melanoma metastasis mouse model, anti-metastatic effects of PEI/antimiR treatment are observed as well.  Conclusions:   We thus describe PEI-based complexes as efficient platform for antimiR therapy, as determined in two different tumor entities using in vivo models of tumor growth or metastasis. Our study also highlights the therapeutic relevance of miR-375, miR-141, miR-150 and miR-638 as target miRNAs for antimiR-mediated inhibition.""","""['Manfred Kunz', 'Madeleine Brandl', 'Animesh Bhattacharya', 'Lars Nobereit-Siegel', 'Alexander Ewe', 'Ulrike Weirauch', 'Doreen Hering', 'Anja Reinert', 'Hermann Kalwa', 'Juan Guzman', 'Katrin Weigelt', 'Sven Wach', 'Helge Taubert', 'Achim Aigner']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""J Nanobiotechnology""","""['Extracellular vesicle (ECV)-modified polyethylenimine (PEI) complexes for enhanced siRNA delivery in vitro and in vivo.', 'PEI-complexed LNA antiseeds as miRNA inhibitors.', 'MicroRNA replacement therapy for miR-145 and miR-33a is efficacious in a model of colon carcinoma.', 'Canonical and non-canonical barriers facing antimiR cancer therapeutics.', 'MicroRNA therapeutics for cardiovascular disease: opportunities and obstacles.', 'MicroRNAs as clinical tools for diagnosis, prognosis, and therapy in prostate cancer.', 'OncomiRs as noncoding RNAs having functions in cancer: Their role in immune suppression and clinical implications.', 'Coaxial Synthesis of PEI-Based Nanocarriers of Encapsulated RNA-Therapeutics to Specifically Target Muscle Cells.', 'Mitochondrial Genetic and Epigenetic Regulations in Cancer: Therapeutic Potential.', 'Integrated Analysis of Mutations, miRNA and mRNA Expression in Glioblastoma.']"""

Increasing number of studies implied that a prior cancer did not adversely affect the clinical outcome among various types of cancer patients. However, the impact of prior cancer on survival of larynx cancer patients remains largely unknown. The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of prior cancer and assess its impact on survival of patients diagnosed with larynx cancer.  Methods:   Patients with larynx cancer as the first or second primary malignancy diagnosed from 2004 to 2015 were extracted from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database. Propensity score matching (PSM) was conducted to balance baseline characteristics. Kaplan-Meier method, multivariate Cox proportional hazard model, and multivariate competing risk model were performed for survival analysis.  Results:   A total of 24,812 eligible patients with larynx cancer were included in the study, wherein a total of 2436 patients (9.8%) had a prior history of cancer. Prostate (36%), lung and bronchus (10%), urinary bladder (7%), and breast (6%) were the most common types of prior cancer. A prior cancer history served as a risk factor for overall survival (AHR =1.30; 95% CI [1.21-1.41]; P < 0.001) but a protective factor for cancer-specific mortality (AHR = 0.83; 95% CI [0.72-0.94]; P = 0.004) in comparison with those without prior cancer. The subgroup analysis showed that a prior history of cancer adversely affected overall survival of patients with larynx cancer in most subgroups stratified by timing and types of prior cancer, as well as by different clinicopathologic features.  Conclusion:   Our study indicated an adverse survival impact of a prior history of cancer on patients with larynx cancer.

Here, we investigated the activation of transcription factors (TFs) in prostate fibroblasts (WPMY cell line) co-cultured with normal prostate or tumorous cells (RWPE1 and RWPE2 cell lines, respectively). After indirect co-cultures, we performed mRNA-seq and predicted TF activity using mRNA expression profiles with the Systems EPigenomics Inference of Regulatory Activity (SEPIRA) package and the GTEx and mRNA-seq data of 483 cultured fibroblasts. The initial differential expression analysis between time points and experimental conditions showed that co-culture with normal epithelial cells mainly promotes an inflammatory response in fibroblasts, whereas with the cancerous epithelial, it stimulates transformation by changing the expression of the genes associated with microfilaments. TF activity analysis revealed only one positively regulated TF in the RWPE1 co-culture alone, while we observed dysregulation of 45 TFs (7 decreased activity and 38 increased activity) uniquely in co-culture with RWPE2. Pathway analysis showed that these 45 dysregulated TFs in fibroblasts co-cultured with RWPE2 cells may be associated with the RUNX1 and PTEN pathways. Moreover, we showed that observed dysregulation could be associated with FER1L4 expression. We conclude that phenotypic changes in fibroblast responses to co-culturing with cancer epithelium result from orchestrated dysregulation of signaling pathways that favor their transformation and motility rather than proinflammatory status. This dysregulation can be observed both at the TF and transcriptome levels.""","""['Przemysław Kapusta', 'Joanna Dulińska-Litewka', 'Justyna Totoń-Żurańska', 'Agnieszka Borys', 'Paweł S Konieczny', 'Paweł P Wołkow', 'Michał T Seweryn']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Int J Mol Sci""","""['Immortalized Cancer-associated Fibroblasts Promote Prostate Cancer Carcinogenesis, Proliferation and Invasion.', 'Activation of Transforming Growth Factor Beta 1 Signaling in Gastric Cancer-associated Fibroblasts Increases Their Motility, via Expression of Rhomboid 5 Homolog 2, and Ability to Induce Invasiveness of Gastric Cancer Cells.', 'YAP1 plays a key role of the conversion of normal fibroblasts into cancer-associated fibroblasts that contribute to prostate cancer progression.', 'Impact of interactions between normal and transformed epithelial cells and the relevance to cancer.', 'Core transcriptional regulatory circuitries in cancer.', 'Peripheral Inflammatory Indexes Neutrophil/Lymphocyte Ratio (NLR) and Red Cell Distribution Width (RDW) as Prognostic Biomarkers in Advanced Solitary Fibrous Tumour (SFT) Treated with Pazopanib.', 'RUNX1 is a promising prognostic biomarker and related to immune infiltrates of cancer-associated fibroblasts in human cancers.', 'Systemic Deficiency of PTEN Accelerates Breast Cancer Growth and Metastasis.']"""

Methods and materials:   Eligibility included standard adjuvant or salvage prostate bed RT indications. Patients were assigned to receive 1 of 3 daily RT schedules: 56.6 Gy in 20 Fx, 50.4 Gy in 15 Fx, or 42.6 Gy in 10 Fx. Regional nodal irradiation and androgen deprivation therapy were not allowed. Participants were followed for 2 years after treatment with outcome measures based on prostate-specific antigen levels, toxicity assessments (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, v4.0), QoL measures (the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite [EPIC] and EuroQol EQ-5D instruments), and out-of-pocket costs.  Results:   There were 32 evaluable participants, and median follow-up was 3.53 years. The shortest dose-fractionation schedule with acceptable toxicity was determined to be 42.6 Gy in 10 Fx, with most patients (23) treated with this schedule. Grade 3 genitourinary (GU) and gastrointestinal (GI) toxicities occurred in 3 patients and 1 patient, respectively. There was 1 grade 4 sepsis event. Higher dose to the hottest 25% of the rectum was associated with increased risk of grade 2+ GI toxicity; no dosimetric factors were found to predict for GU toxicity.

We hypothesized that TNFAIP8 promotes prostate cancer (PCa) progression via regulation of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and glycolysis. Ectopic expression of TNFAIP8 increased PCa cell proliferation/migration/spheroid formation by enhancing cell metabolic activities. Mechanistically, TNFAIP8 activated the PI3K-AKT pathway and up-regulated PCa cell survival. TNFAIP8 was also found to regulate the expression of glucose metabolizing enzymes, enhancing glucose consumption, and endogenous ATP production. Treatment with a glycolysis inhibitor, 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG), reduced TNFAIP8 mediated glucose consumption, ATP production, spheroid formation, and PCa cell migration. By maintaining mitochondrial membrane potential, TNFAIP8 increased OXPHOS and glycolysis. Moreover, TNFAIP8 modulates the production of glycolytic metabolites in PCa cells. Collectively, our data suggest that TNFAIP8 exerts its oncogenic effects by enhancing glucose metabolism and by facilitating metabolic reprogramming in PCa cells. Therefore, TNFAIP8 may be a biomarker associated with prostate cancer and indicate a potential therapeutic target.""","""['Suryakant Niture', 'Minghui Lin', 'Joab O Odera', 'John Moore', 'Hong Zhe', 'Xiaoxin Chen', 'Simeng Suy', 'Sean P Collins', 'Deepak Kumar']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Int J Biochem Cell Biol""","""['Transcriptome and Proteome Analyses of TNFAIP8 Knockdown Cancer Cells Reveal New Insights into Molecular Determinants of Cell Survival and Tumor Progression.', 'MicroRNA-205-5p inhibits skin cancer cell proliferation and increase drug sensitivity by targeting TNFAIP8.', 'The significance of TNFAIP8 in prostate cancer response to radiation and docetaxel and disease recurrence.', 'Oncogenic Role of Tumor Necrosis Factor α-Induced Protein 8 (TNFAIP8).', 'AMPK/GSK3β/β-catenin cascade-triggered overexpression of CEMIP promotes migration and invasion in anoikis-resistant prostate cancer cells by enhancing metabolic reprogramming.', 'MicroRNA-483-5p Inhibits Hepatocellular Carcinoma Cell Proliferation, Cell Steatosis, and Fibrosis by Targeting PPARα and TIMP2.', 'circHUWE1 Exerts an Oncogenic Role in Inducing DDP-Resistant NSCLC Progression Depending on the Regulation of miR-34a-5p/TNFAIP8.']"""

HIC1 encodes a transcriptional repressor involved in various aspects of the DNA damage response and in complex regulatory loops with P53 and SIRT1. HIC1 expression in normal prostate tissues has not yet been investigated in detail. Here, we demonstrated by immunohistochemistry that detectable HIC1 expression is restricted to the stroma of both normal and tumor prostate tissues. By RT-qPCR, we showed that HIC1 is poorly expressed in all tested prostate epithelial lineage cell types: primary (PrEC), immortalized (RWPE1) or transformed androgen-dependent (LnCAP) or androgen-independent (PC3 and DU145) prostate epithelial cells. By contrast, HIC1 is strongly expressed in primary PrSMC and immortalized (WMPY-1) prostate myofibroblastic cells. HIC1 depletion in WPMY-1 cells induced decreases in α-SMA expression and contractile capability. In addition to SLUG, we identified stromal cell-derived factor 1/C-X-C motif chemokine 12 (SDF1/CXCL12) as a new HIC1 direct target-gene. Thus, our results identify HIC1 as a tumor suppressor gene which is poorly expressed in the epithelial cells targeted by the tumorigenic process. HIC1 is expressed in stromal myofibroblasts and regulates CXCL12/SDF1 expression, thereby highlighting a complex interplay mediating the tumor promoting activity of the tumor microenvironment.

A significant result was also found in recessive model with adjusted OR of 1.719. Individuals with GG genotype of rs1456315 were at increased risks of LC compared with those carrying AA genotype. Similar results were found in NSCLC patients. Meta-analysis showed that rs1016343 and rs13252298 were associated with overall cancer.

Efficacy and safety of darolutamide in Japanese patients are reported here.  Methods:   In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase III trial, 1509 patients with nmCRPC and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) doubling time ≤ 10 months were randomized 2:1 to darolutamide 600 mg twice daily or matched placebo while continuing androgen deprivation therapy. The primary endpoint was MFS.  Results:   In Japan, 95 patients were enrolled and randomized to darolutamide (n = 62) or placebo (n = 33). At the primary analysis (cut-off date: September 3, 2018), after 20 primary end-point events had occurred, median MFS was not reached with darolutamide vs. 18.2 months with placebo (HR 0.28, 95% CI 0.11-0.70). Median OS was not reached due to limited numbers of events in both groups but favored darolutamide in the Japanese subgroup. Time to pain progression, time to PSA progression, and PSA response also favored darolutamide. Among Japanese patients randomized to darolutamide vs. placebo, incidences of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were 85.5 vs. 63.6%, and incidences of treatment discontinuation due to TEAEs were 8.1 vs. 6.1%.  Conclusions:   Efficacy outcomes favored darolutamide in Japanese patients with nmCRPC, supporting the clinical benefit of darolutamide in this patient population.

SMRs for pancreatic cancer or hepatocellular carcinoma could not be calculated due to low numbers. The small number of malignancies identified in our FD/MAS cohort precluded the calculation of SMRs for our cohort specifically. Our findings show that patients with FD/MAS appear to have an increased risk for osteosarcoma, cervical, thyroid, and prostate cancer and melanoma.

Although some clinical discrepancies may be attributed to genetic risk and/or access to care, explanations for racial discrepancies in decisional regret remain largely speculative. We aim to identify sources of prostate cancer decisional regret with a focus on racial disparities.  Materials and methods:   A cohort of 1,112 patients with localized prostate cancer treated at the Cleveland Clinic between 2010 and 2016 were matched by race, Gleason score, treatment (external beam radiation, brachytherapy, prostatectomy, active surveillance), prostate specific antigen at diagnosis, age at treatment and time since treatment. All patients received 4 surveys, including the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC) 26, the Decisional Regret Scale, our novel Prostate Cancer Beliefs Questionnaire and a modified EPIC demographics form. Descriptive and comparative statistics and multivariable logistic regression were used to compare survey outcomes by race and treatment method.  Results:   Of 1,048 deliverable surveys 378 (36.07%) were returned. African American men had worse decisional regret than nonAfrican American men even after adjusting for relevant covariates (OR 2.46, p <0.0001). African American men also had higher Prostate Cancer Beliefs Questionnaire medical mistrust and masculinity scores, both of which predicted worse decisional regret independent of race (1.415 and 1.350, p=0.0001, respectively).  Conclusions:   African American men suffer worse decisional regret than nonAfrican American men, which may be partially explained by higher medical mistrust and concerns about masculinity as captured by the Prostate Cancer Beliefs Questionnaire.

The ultrasound probe manipulator includes a position adjustment module that can lock four joints at the same time. It reduces operating time and improves the stability of the mechanism. We use the attitude adjustment module designed by double parallelogram RCM mechanism, the ultrasound probe can realize centering and prevent its radial motion. The self-weight balance design helps doctors operate ultrasound probe without weight. Using MATLAB to analyze the manipulator, the results show that the workspace of the mechanism can meet the biopsy requirements. And simulate the centering effect of the ultrasound probe when the attitude is adjusted at different feeding distances, the results show that the ultrasound probe is centering stability. Finally, the centering and joint interlocking tests of the physical prototype are completed. In this paper, a 7-DOF manipulator for transrectal ultrasound probe is designed. The mechanism is analyzed for kinematics, workspace analysis, simulation of centering effects, development of a physical prototype and related experimental research.

In this report, an electrochemical biosensor based on the target-induced cleavage of a specific peptide substrate (PSA peptide) is designed for the highly selective detection of PSA at the femtomolar level, using electrochemically controlled atom transfer radical polymerization (eATRP) as a method for signal amplification. The PSA peptides, without free carboxyl sites, are attached to the gold surface via the N-terminal cysteine residue. The target-induced cleavage of PSA peptides results in the generation of carboxyl sites, to which the alkyl halide initiator α-bromophenylacetic acid (BPAA) is linked via the Zr(IV) linkers. Subsequently, the potentiostatic eATRP of ferrocenylmethyl methacrylate (FcMMA, as the monomer) leads to the surface-initiated grafting of high-density ferrocenyl polymers. As a result, a large amount of Fc redox tags can be recruited for signal amplification, through which the limit of detection (LOD) for PSA can be down to 3.2 fM. As the recognition element, the PSA peptide is easy to synthesize, chemically and thermally stable, and low-cost.

The purpose of this study was to estimate associations between social needs and HRQOL.  Methods:   Results included data from 1754 participants in the Detroit Research on Cancer Survivors cohort, a population-based study of African American survivors of breast, colorectal, lung, and prostate cancer. Social needs included items related to food insecurity, utility shutoffs, housing instability, not getting health care because of cost or a lack of transportation, and perceptions of neighborhood safety. HRQOL was measured with the validated Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General (FACT-G). Linear regression models controlled for demographic, socioeconomic, and cancer-related factors.  Results:   More than one-third of the survivors (36.3%) reported social needs including 17.1% of survivors reported 2 or more. The prevalence of social needs ranged from 14.8% for food insecurity to 8.9% for utility shutoffs. FACT-G score differences associated with social needs were -12.2 (95% confidence interval [CI] to -15.2 to -9.3) for not getting care because of a lack of transportation, -11.3 (95% CI, -14.2 to -8.4) for housing instability, -10.1 (95% CI, -12.7 to -7.4) for food insecurity, -9.8 (95% CI, -12.7 to -6.9) for feeling unsafe in the neighborhood, -8.6 (95% CI, -11.7 to -5.4) for utility shutoffs, and -6.7 (95% CI, -9.2 to -4.1) for not getting care because of cost.  Conclusions:   Social needs were common in this cohort of African American cancer survivors and were associated with clinically significant differences in HRQOL.

Based on the initial findings from the GSE26910 dataset, inhibin-β A (INHBA) was used for subsequent experiments, and miR-211 was then predicted as a candidate regulatory miR. Subsequently, INHBA and miR-211 were observed to be highly and poorly expressed in PCa tissues, respectively, and miR-211 negatively target INHBA. CD44+CD133+ cells were isolated, and both miR-211 and INHBA expression was altered in these cells to assess functional role of miR-211 and INHBA in PCa stem cells. Overexpression of miR-211 decreased expression of TGF-β1, TGF-β2, smad2, smad3, phosphorylated smad2 and smad3, and stem cell markers. miR-211 upregulation or INHBA knockdown resulted in reductions in the proliferation, invasion, colony-forming ability, sphere-forming ability, and stemness of PCa stem cells but enhanced their apoptosis in vitro. Furthermore, miR-211 upregulation or INHBA silencing decreased tumor growth and cell apoptosis in vivo.

Materials and methods:   The records of high-risk PCa patients who were preoperatively staged through 68Ga PSMA PET-CT and who underwent robot-assisted radical prostatectomy with eLND either alone or as part of multimodal definitive therapy between August 2016 and November 2019 were retrospectively reviewed. Surgeons were not blinded to the results of the 68Ga PSMA PET-CT scan. Pathologic uptake was defined as any anomalous uptake which was not better explained by another cause and was suggestive of PCa. The reference standard for this study was the pathologic confirmation using a node-based analysis. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and accuracy for 68Ga PSMA PET-CT were calculated in a per-patient analysis using IBM SPSS Statistics version 25.  Results:   Seventeen patients met the selection criteria. Mean age was 63 years (range 44-77) and mean and median preoperative serum prostate specific antigen was 19.25 and 9 ng/ml (range 6-131), respectively. The most common pathologic Gleason score was 8 (52.9% of cases). Seven patients (41%) had positive surgical margins and were submitted to adjuvant radiotherapy. Mean number of per patient removed lymph-nodes was 13 (±2.19). 68Ga PSMA PET-CT showed findings compatible with lymph node metastases in 4/17 patients and with locally-confined disease in 13/17 patients.

Given the rarity of this subtype, optimal treatment strategies for men with nonmetastatic ductal PCa is largely unknown. We aimed to describe the impact of surgery, radiotherapy, systemic therapy, and observation on overall survival (OS) in men with nonmetastatic ductal PCa.  Materials and methods:   We selected 1,656 cases of nonmetastatic ductal PCa, diagnosed between 2004 and 2015, within the National Cancer Database. Covariates included age, race, Charlson comorbidity score, clinical T stage, clinical lymph node stage, serum prostate specific antigen (PSA), income, hospital type, insurance status, year of diagnosis, and location of residence. Cox regression analysis tested the impact of treatment (surgery, radiotherapy, systemic therapy, and observation) on OS.  Results:   In men with nonmetastatic ductal PCa, median (interquartile range [IQR]) age and PSA were 67 (60-73) years and 6.2 (4.2-10.7) ng/ml, respectively. Advanced local stage (≥cT3a) was most frequently observed in patients initially treated with systemic therapy (34.8%), followed by those treated with radiotherapy (18.1%), surgery (7.1%) and observation (6.4%, P< 0.001). Serum PSA at presentation was highest in the systemic therapy cohort (median 16.0 ng/ml, IQR: 4.9-37.7), followed by the radiotherapy cohort (median 7.2 ng/ml, IQR: 4.1-12.2), observation cohort (median 7.0 ng/ml, IQR: 4.3-13.3) and surgery cohort (median 5.9 ng/ml, IQR: 4.3-9.2, P< 0.001). Multivariable analysis showed that in comparison to men treated surgically, OS was significantly lower for patients receiving radiotherapy (HR 2.2; 95% CI: 1.5-3.2), under observation (HR 4.6; 95% CI: 2.8-7.6) and receiving systemic therapy (HR 5.2; 95% CI: 3.0-9.1) as an initial course of treatment.

However, their development is often laborious and time-consuming. Herein, we have developed and preclinically evaluated three PDCs with gemcitabine as the anticancer cytotoxic unit and D-Lys6-GnRH (gonadotropin-releasing hormone; GnRH) as the cancer-targeting unit. These units were tethered via acid-labile programmable linkers to guide a differential drug release rate from the PDC through a combination of ester or amide and ""click"" type oxime ligations. The pro-drugs were designed to enable the selective targeting of malignant tumor cells with linker guided differential drug release rates. We exploited the oxime bond responsiveness against the acidic pH of the tumor microenvironment and the GnRH endocytosis via the GnRH-R GPCR which is overexpressed on cancer cells. The challenging metabolic properties of gemcitabine were addressed during design of the PDCs. We developed a rapid (1 hour) and cost-effective ""click"" oxime bond ligation platform to assemble in one-pot the 3 desired PDCs that does not require purification, surpassing traditional time-ineffective and low yield methods. The internalization of the tumor-homing peptide unit in cancer cells, overexpressing the GnRH-R, was first validated through confocal laser microscopy and flow cytometry analysis. Subsequently, the three PDCs were evaluated for their in vitro antiproliferative effect in prostate cancer cells. Their stability and the release of gemcitabine over time were monitored in vitro in cell culture and in human plasma using LC-MS/MS. We then assessed the ability of the developed PDCs to internalize in prostate cancer cells and to release gemcitabine. The most potent analog, designated GOXG1, was used for pharmacokinetic studies in mice. The metabolism of GOXG1 was examined in liver microsomes, as well as in buffers mimicking the pH of intracellular organelles, resulting in the identification of two metabolites. The major metabolite at low pH emanated from the cleavage of the pH-labile oxime bond, validating our design approach. NMR spectroscopy and in vitro radioligand binding assays were exploited for GOXG1 to validate that upon conjugating the drug to the peptide, the peptide microenvironment responsible for its GnRH-R binding is not perturbed and to confirm its high binding potency to the GnRH-R. Finally, the binding of GOXG1 to the GnRH-R and the associated elicitation of testosterone release in mice were also determined. The facile platform established herein for the rapid assembly of PDCs with linker controllable characteristics from aldehyde and aminooxy units through rapid ""click"" oxime ligation, that does not require purification steps, could pave the way for a new generation of potent cancer therapeutics, diagnostics and theranostics.""","""['Eirinaios I Vrettos', 'Theodoros Karampelas', 'Nisar Sayyad', 'Anastasia Kougioumtzi', 'Nelofer Syed', 'Timothy Crook', 'Carol Murphy', 'Constantin Tamvakopoulos', 'Andreas G Tzakos']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Eur J Med Chem""","""['Development of bioactive gemcitabine-D-Lys6-GnRH prodrugs with linker-controllable drug release rate and enhanced biopharmaceutical profile.', 'GnRH-Gemcitabine conjugates for the treatment of androgen-independent prostate cancer: pharmacokinetic enhancements combined with targeted drug delivery.', 'Gemcitabine Based Peptide Conjugate with Improved Metabolic Properties and Dual Mode of Efficacy.', 'Gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptors as molecular therapeutic targets in prostate cancer: Current options and emerging strategies.', 'Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone Receptors in Prostate Cancer: Molecular Aspects and Biological Functions.', 'Peptide-drug conjugates (PDCs): a novel trend of research and development on targeted therapy, hype or hope?', 'Recent Progress in Bio-Responsive Drug Delivery Systems for Tumor Therapy.', 'Design Principles Governing the Development of Theranostic Anticancer Agents and Their Nanoformulations with Photoacoustic Properties.', 'Recent Advances in pH- or/and Photo-Responsive Nanovehicles.']"""

Medicare determines physician work RVUs (wRVUs) from the Relative Value Update Committee (RUC) for a procedure based on operative time, technical skill and effort, mental effort and judgment, and stress. In theory, work RVUs should account for the complexity and operative time involved in a procedure. The aim of this study was to assess whether major procedures for treatment of benign prostatic enlargement (BPE) are fairly compensated based on complexity and operative time in the RVU system and compare them with the intended reimbursement. Methods: The American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS-NSQIP) database and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) Medicare Physician Fee Schedule were queried from 2015 to 2017. Single, current, procedural terminology codes associated with BPE treatments were included: transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP), photovaporization of the prostate (PVP), holmium laser enucleation of the prostate (HoLEP), retropubic simple prostatectomy (RSP), and suprapubic simple prostatectomy (SSP). The CMS operative times and the NSQIP real data were used in turn to calculate separate values for wRVUs per hour (wRVUs/hr) of operative time. The wRVUs/hr derived from CMS operative times represent RUC-estimated wRVUs/hr and wRVUs/hr derived from NSQIP represent actual wRVUs/hr. Results: A total of 27,664 cases were included from the NSQIP dataset. Median wRVU was 15.3 (interquartile range [IQR] 12.2-15.3), median operative time 50 minutes (IQR 33-74), and median wRVUs/hr 17.0 (IQR 11.6-26.2). RUC-estimated wRVUs/hr were TURP 12.2, PVP 12.2, RSP 9, SSP 9.3, and HoLEP 7.3. The actual wRVUs/hr were TURP 19.1, PVP 15.5, RSP 10.2, HoLEP 9.4, and SSP 7.6. Conclusions: Laser enucleation and simple prostatectomy are highly complex and efficacious procedures for treating BPE, yet the current payment schedule assigns these procedures the least amount of wRVUs/hr.

CARMIL3-deficient macrophages expressed strongly abrogated levels of interleukin (IL)-6, TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-23 in response to LPS, whereas IL-10 expression was enhanced. An RNA-seq analysis of CARMIL3-deficient and wild-type (WT) RAW264.7 cells stimulated with LPS revealed many differentially expressed genes, impacting several important inflammatory pathways. At the molecular level, CARMIL3 deficiency caused a strong impairment in LPS-activated nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) signaling with decreased IKKα/β and IκBα phosphorylation and severely reduced p65 protein levels.

Here, we describe the performance of a novel stimulus-responsive nanoparticulate platform for the targeted treatment of prostate cancer using sonodynamic therapy (SDT). The nanoparticles were prepared by self-assembly of poly(L-glutamic acid-L-tyrosine) co-polymer with hematoporphyrin. The nanoparticulate formulation was characterized with respect to particle size, morphology, surface charge and singlet oxygen production during ultrasound exposure. The response of the formulation to the presence of cathepsin B, a proteolytic enzyme that is overexpressed and secreted in the tumour microenvironment of many solid tumours, was assessed. Our results showed that digestion with cathepsin B led to nanoparticle size reduction. In the absence of ultrasound, the formulation exhibited greater toxicity at acidic pH than at physiological pH, using the human prostate cells lines LNCaP and PC3 as targets. Nanoparticle cellular uptake was enhanced at acidic pH - a condition that was also associated with greater cathepsin B production. Nanoparticles exhibited enhanced ultrasound-induced cytotoxicity against both prostate cancer cell lines.

As the cell radiosensitivity decreased, the nucleus size decreased and the lesion size increased, the absorbed dose to reach a given TCP increased. The widest variations occurred with regard to the cell radiosensitivity.

The aim of this study was therefore to identify the physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model parameters that determine the interindividual variability of absorbed doses (ADs) to kidneys and tumor lesions in therapy with 177 Lu-labeled PSMA-targeting radioligands.  Methods:   A global sensitivity analysis (GSA) with the extended Fourier Amplitude Sensitivity Test (eFAST) algorithm was performed. The whole-body PBPK model for PSMA-targeting radioligand therapy from our previous studies was used in this study. The model parameters of interest (input of the GSA) were the organ receptor densities [R0 ], the organ blood flows f, and the organ release rates λ. These parameters were systematically sampled NE times according to their distribution in the patient population. The corresponding pharmacokinetics were simulated and the ADs (model output) to kidneys and tumor lesions were collected. The main effect S i and total effect S Ti were calculated using the eFAST algorithm based on the variability of the model output: The main effect S i of input parameter i represents the reduction in variance of the output if the ""true"" value of parameter i would be known. The total effect S Ti of an input parameter i represents the proportion of variance remaining if the ""true"" values of all other input parameters except for i are known. The numbers of samples NE were increased up to 8193 to check the stability (i.e., convergence) of the calculated main effects S i and total effects S Ti .  Results:   From the simulations, the relative interindividual variability of ADs in the kidneys (coefficient of variation CV = 31%) was lower than that of ADs in the tumors (CV up to 59%). Based on the GSA, the most important parameters that determine the ADs to the kidneys were kidneys flow ( S i = 0.36, S Ti = 0.43) and kidneys receptor density ( S i = 0.25, S Ti = 0.30). Tumor receptor density was identified as the most important parameter determining the ADs to tumors ( S i and S Ti up to 0.72).  Conclusions:   The results suggest that an accurate measurement of receptor density and flow before therapy could be a promising approach for developing an individualized treatment with 177 Lu-labeled PSMA-targeting radioligands.""","""['Deni Hardiansyah', 'Peter Kletting', 'Nusrat J Begum', 'Matthias Eiber', 'Ambros J Beer', 'Supriyanto A Pawiro', 'Gerhard Glatting']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Prediction of Normal Organ Absorbed Doses for 177LuLu-PSMA-617 Using 44ScSc-PSMA-617 Pharmacokinetics in Patients With Metastatic Castration Resistant Prostate Carcinoma.', 'Radiation Dosimetry for 177Lu-PSMA I&T in Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer: Absorbed Dose in Normal Organs and Tumor Lesions.', 'Pre-therapeutic dosimetry of normal organs and tissues of (177)Lu-PSMA-617 prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) inhibitor in patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'PSMA radioligand therapy in patients with advanced prostate cancer.', 'Therapeutic Responses and Survival Effects of 177Lu-PSMA-617 Radioligand Therapy in Metastatic Castrate-Resistant Prostate Cancer: A Meta-analysis.', 'Current use and future potential of (physiologically based) pharmacokinetic modelling of radiopharmaceuticals: a review.', 'Single-time-point estimation of absorbed doses in PRRT using a non-linear mixed-effects model.', 'Global sensitivity analysis in physiologically-based pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic models of inhaled and opioids anesthetics and its application to generate virtual populations.', 'Patient-specific dosimetry adapted to variable number of SPECT/CT time-points per cycle for Formula: see textLu-DOTATATE therapy.', 'A population-based method to determine the time-integrated activity in molecular radiotherapy.']"""

Methods:   Immunohistochemistry for mismatch repair proteins (MLH1, MSH2, MSH6 and PMS2) was performed in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded sections prepared from resected primary prostate cancers in patients who underwent prostatectomy at our institution between January 2001 and May 2016. Genetic and/or epigenetic alterations of mismatch repair genes were investigated in patients with any loss of mismatch repair protein expression in the tumour.  Results:   Of the 337 patients, four (1.2%) showed loss of mismatch repair protein expression on immunohistochemistry. All four patients showed loss of both MSH2 and MSH6 protein expression. Genetic testing was performed in two of the four patients, demonstrating no pathogenic germline alterations were present. In each of these two patients, at least one somatic alteration inactivating MSH2 without MSH2 hypermethylation was identified, leading to the diagnosis of supposed 'Lynch-like syndrome'. Patients with deficient mismatch repair prostate cancer were at a significantly higher stage (pT2pN0 vs. pT3-4pN0/pTanypN1, P = 0.02) and had a greater Gleason score (<8 vs. ≥8, P < 0.01) than those with proficient mismatch repair prostate cancer.  Conclusions:   The prevalence of deficient mismatch repair prostate cancer in the Japanese hospital-based prostatectomized population was extremely low.

We demonstrate the scalability, efficiency, and utility of ProTECT on 326 samples from the TCGA Prostate Adenocarcinoma cohort, identifying recurrent potential neoepitopes from TMPRSS2-ERG fusions, and from SNVs in SPOP. We also compare ProTECT with results from published tools. ProTECT can be run on a standalone computer, a local cluster, or on a compute cloud using a Mesos backend.

Immunohistochemical and Western blot analyses showed significantly increased p75NTR expression in the dorsal nerve of CNI mice, which was attenuated by LM11A-31 treatment. Protein expression of active PI3K, AKT, and endothelial nitric oxide synthase was increased, and cell death and c-Jun N-terminal kinase signaling was significantly attenuated after LM11A-31 treatment. Furthermore, LM11A-31 promoted neurite sprouting in cultured major pelvic ganglia after lipopolysaccharide exposure.  Clinical implications:   LM11A-31 may be used as a strategy to treat erectile dysfunction after radical prostatectomy or in men with neurovascular diseases.  Strengths & limitations:   Unlike biological therapeutics, such as proteins, gene therapies, or stem cells, the clinical application of LM11A-31 would likely be relatively less complex and low cost. Our study has some limitations. Future studies will assess the optimal dosing and duration of the compound. Given its plasma half-life of approximately 1 hour, it is possible that dosing more than once per day will provide added efficacy.  Conclusion:   Specific inhibition of the proNGF-p75NTR degenerative signaling via oral administration of LM11A-31 represents a novel therapeutic strategy for erectile dysfunction induced by nerve injury.

Methods:   From April 2013 to April 2019, 322 men with elevated prostate-specific antigen (PSA <20 ng/mL) and unilateral MRI-positive lobes underwent targeted 4-core and systematic 14-core biopsy. MRI findings were prospectively collected and evaluated according to the Prostate Imaging-Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) version 2, and scores ≥3 were considered positive.

Methods and materials:   All patients who underwent postoperative IMRT or PBT to the prostate bed only at a single institution were included (2009-2017). Endpoints included biochemical failure (BF; using institutional and recent cooperative group trial definitions), local failure (LF), regional failure (RF), distant failure (DF), and all-cause mortality. A case-matched cohort analysis was performed using 3-to-1 nearest-neighbor matching; multivariable Cox proportional hazards modeling (MVA) estimated hazard ratios for disease-related outcomes by treatment modality.  Results:   Of 295 men, 260 were matched (n = 65 PBT, 195 IMRT); after matching, only age at diagnosis (P < .01) significantly differed between cohorts. At a median follow-up of 59 months, BF (institution-defined), LF, RF, DF, and mortality rates were 45% (n = 29), 2% (n = 1), 9% (n = 6), 9% (n = 6), and 2% (n = 1) for PBT, and 41% (n = 80), 3% (n = 5), 7% (n = 13), 9% (n = 18), and 5% (n = 9) for IMRT (all P > .05). RT modality was not significantly associated with BF on MVA using institutional or cooperative group definitions (all P > .05), nor with LF (P = .82), RF (P = .11), DF (P = .36), or all-cause mortality (P = .69).

This study presents a comparison of 68Ga, 44Sc and 177Lu-labeled AAZTA5-PSMA-617 with DOTA-PSMA-617 analogues. We evaluated the radiolabeling characteristics, in vitro stability of the radiolabeled compounds and evaluated their binding affinity and internalization behavior on LNCaP tumor cells in direct comparison to the radiolabeled DOTA-conjugated PSMA-617 analogs.  Results:   AAZTA5 was synthesized in a five-step synthesis and coupled to the PSMA-617 backbone on solid phase. Radiochemical evaluation of AAZTA5-PSMA-617 with 68Ga, 44Sc and 177Lu achieved quantitative radiolabeling of > 99% after less than 5 min at room temperature. Stabilities against human serum, PBS buffer and EDTA and DTPA solutions were analyzed. While there was a small degradation of the 68Ga complex over 2 h in human serum, PBS and EDTA/DTPA, the 44Sc and 177Lu complexes were stable at 2 h and remained stable over 8 h and 1 day. For all three compounds, i.e. [natGa]Ga-AAZTA5-PSMA-617, [natSc]Sc-AAZTA5-PSMA-617 and [natLu]Lu-AAZTA5-PSMA-617, in vitro studies on PSMA-positive LNCaP cells were performed in direct comparison to radiolabeled DOTA-PSMA-617 yielding the corresponding inhibition constants (Ki). Ki values were in the range of 8-31 nM values which correspond with those of [natGa]Ga-DOTA-PSMA-617, [natSc]Sc-DOTA-PSMA-617 and [natLu]Lu-DOTA-PSMA-617, i.e. 5-7 nM, respectively. Internalization studies demonstrated cellular membrane to internalization ratios for the radiolabeled 68Ga, 44Sc and 177Lu-AAZTA5-PSMA-617 tracers (13-20%IA/106 cells) in the same range as the ones of the three radiolabeled DOTA-PSMA-617 tracers (17-20%IA/106 cells) in the same assay.  Conclusions:   The AAZTA5-PSMA-617 structure proved fast and quantitative radiolabeling with all three radiometal complexes at room temperature, excellent stability with 44Sc, very high stability with 177Lu and medium stability with 68Ga in human serum, PBS and EDTA/DTPA solutions. All three AAZTA5-PSMA-617 tracers showed binding affinities and internalization ratios in LNCaP cells comparable with that of radiolabeled DOTA-PSMA-617 analogues. Therefore, the exchange of the chelator DOTA with AAZTA5 within the PSMA-617 binding motif has no negative influence on in vitro LNCaP cell binding characteristics. In combination with the faster and milder radiolabeling features, AAZTA5-PSMA-617 thus demonstrates promising potential for in vivo application for theranostics of prostate cancer.""","""['Jean-Philippe Sinnes', 'Ulrike Bauder-Wüst', 'Martin Schäfer', 'Euy Sung Moon', 'Klaus Kopka', 'Frank Rösch']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""EJNMMI Radiopharm Chem""","""['AAZTA5/AAZTA5-TOC: synthesis and radiochemical evaluation with 68Ga, 44Sc and 177Lu.', 'Design, synthesis, and preclinical evaluation of a novel bifunctional macrocyclic chelator for theranostics of cancers.', 'Clinical Translation and First In-Human Use of 44ScSc-PSMA-617 for PET Imaging of Metastasized Castrate-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'AAZTA-Derived Chelators for the Design of Innovative Radiopharmaceuticals with Theranostic Applications.', '44Sc-Labeled 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7,10-tetraacetic acid–conjugated puromycin.', 'Cyclotron production of 43Sc and 44gSc from enriched 42CaO, 43CaO, and 44CaO targets.', 'Peptide-based positron emission tomography probes: current strategies for synthesis and radiolabelling.', 'Modern Developments in Bifunctional Chelator Design for Gallium Radiopharmaceuticals.', 'Advances in PSMA theranostics.', 'Cold Kit Labeling: The Future of 68Ga Radiopharmaceuticals?']"""

Its incidence varies more than 25-fold worldwide, which is primarily attributed to the implementation of the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test in developed countries. To reduce harm of overdiagnosis, most international guidelines recommend surveillance programmes. However, this approach can entail negative psychosocial consequences from being under surveillance for an (over)diagnosed prostate cancer.  Aim:   To explore men's feelings and experiences in a surveillance programme.  Design and setting:   Qualitative study with Danish men diagnosed with asymptomatic prostate cancer Gleason score ≤ 6, who are in a surveillance programme.  Methods:   12 semi-structured, individual interviews were conducted and analysed with systematic text condensation and selected theories.  Results:   Most informants reported that they were astonished at the time of diagnosis. They were aware of the small likelihood of dying from cancer, but in some cases, the uncertainty created ambivalence between knowing and not knowing. The men expressed their risk awareness in different ways: a realization that life does not last forever, uncertainty towards the future, a feeling of powerlessness, and a need for control.  Conclusions:   The men in this study had substantial psychosocial consequences from being labelled with a cancer diagnosis. Bearing these men's high risk of overdiagnosis in mind, it is important to discuss whether the harms of this diagnosis outweigh the benefits. The psychosocial consequences of being in a prostate cancer surveillance programme should be explored further. KEY POINTS Current awareness: The number of men living with an asymptomatic prostate cancer has increased the last 20 years after the implementation of the PSA test. Main Statements: Men living with an asymptomatic, low-risk prostate cancer experience negative psychocosial consequences GPs should consider the possible negative psychosocial consequences in their decision-making of measuring the PSA level.""","""['Sigrid Brisson Nielsen', 'Olivia Spalletta', 'Mads Aage Toft Kristensen', 'John Brodersen']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Scand J Prim Health Care""","""['Resisting recommended treatment for prostate cancer: a qualitative analysis of the lived experience of possible overdiagnosis.', 'Perceptions about screening for prostate cancer using genetic lifetime risk assessment: a qualitative study.', ""Doctors' approaches to PSA testing and overdiagnosis in primary healthcare: a qualitative study."", 'Prostate-Specific Antigen-Based Screening for Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Evidence Review for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force Internet.', 'Prostate-Specific Antigen-Based Screening for Prostate Cancer: Evidence Report and Systematic Review for the US Preventive Services Task Force.', 'Fictitious cases as a methodology to discuss sensitive health topics in focus groups.', 'Application Value of Radiomic Nomogram in the Differential Diagnosis of Prostate Cancer and Hyperplasia.', 'I would rather be vaguely right than precisely wrong.', 'Using theories and frameworks to understand how to reduce low-value healthcare: a scoping review.', ""Managing lower urinary tract symptoms in primary care: qualitative study of GPs' and patients' experiences.""]"""

There is a lack of research on the overall morbidity prostate cancer survivors face and the amount of healthcare treatment they receive toward the end of their lives. Identifying these care needs will allow appropriate healthcare modeling, resource allocation and service re-design to ensure higher quality care toward the end of life. The aim of this study is to quantify and analyze the use of healthcare services by patients dying with but not necessarily of prostate cancer.  Methods:   All patients who died with a diagnosis of prostate cancer during a 2-year period at a single hospital were included. Data on outpatient attendances, elective and emergency admissions and palliative care involvement in the 12 months prior to death were collected.  Results:   A total of 77 patients were included and of these, 60 (78.0%) had 545 scheduled appointments with 473 (86.8%) attendances. More non-attendances occurred in the last 6 months of life; 56 vs 16, p < 0.001. Nurse led clinics doubled in the last 6 months of life, 117 vs 66. There were 173 admissions from 63 (81.8%) patients resulting in 1816 days inpatient stay. This averaged to 2.7 admissions per patient for 10.5 days per episode. 32 (41.6%) patients were seen by palliative care resulting in 192 visits in total. 78 (40.6%) were inpatient and 114 (59.4%) were community reviews.

Previous simulation models have emulated clinical trials, and relied on extensive assumptions on the natural history of the disease. In addition, model parameters were typically calibrated to a variety of data sources. We propose a model designed to emulate real-life scenarios of chronic disease using a proxy for the diagnostic activity without explicitly modeling the natural history of the disease and properties of clinical tests. Our model was applied to Swedish nation-wide population-based prostate cancer data, and demonstrated good performance in terms of reconstructing observed incidence and mortality. The model was used to predict the number of prostate cancer diagnoses with a high or limited diagnostic activity between 2017 and 2060. In the long term, high diagnostic activity resulted in a substantial increase in the number of men diagnosed with lower risk disease, fewer men with metastatic disease, and decreased prostate cancer mortality. The model can be used for prediction of outcome, to guide decision-making, and to evaluate diagnostic activity in real-life settings with respect to overdiagnosis and prostate cancer mortality.""","""['Marcus Westerberg', 'Rolf Larsson', 'Lars Holmberg', 'Pär Stattin', 'Hans Garmo']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Stat Med""","""['Variation in Prostate-Specific Antigen Testing Rates and Prostate Cancer Treatments and Outcomes in a National 20-Year Cohort.', 'A natural history model for planning prostate cancer testing: Calibration and validation using Swedish registry data.', 'Uptake of prostate-specific antigen testing for early prostate cancer detection in Sweden.', 'Prostate cancer overdiagnosis and overtreatment.', 'Recent Changes in Prostate Cancer Screening Practices and Epidemiology.', 'Diagnostic activity impacts lifetime risk of prostate cancer diagnosis more strongly than life expectancy.', 'Changes in Characteristics of Men with Lethal Prostate Cancer During the Past 25 Years: Description of Population-based Deaths.', 'Variation in Prostate-Specific Antigen Testing Rates and Prostate Cancer Treatments and Outcomes in a National 20-Year Cohort.']"""

Of these, 49.74% of genes had 2-10 interactions, 22.93% were involved in hallmarks of cancer, and 21.61% were identified as core essential genes. Many genes were shown to have important biological roles via functional enrichment analysis, and 65 were identified as potentially crucial in the pathophysiology of cancer. Gene pairs with dysregulated expression patterns had higher prognostic values. Further screening based on mutation and expression levels showed that remaining gene pairs were mainly derived from human predicted or validated pairs, while most predicted pairs from yeast were filtered from analysis. Genes with synthetic lethality were further analyzed with their interactive microRNAs (miRNAs) at the isomiR level which have been widely studied as negatively regulatory molecules. The miRNA-mRNA interaction network revealed that many synthetic lethal genes contributed to the cell cycle (seven of 12 genes), cancer pathways (five of 12 genes), oocyte meiosis, the p53 signaling pathway, and hallmarks of cancer. Our study contributes to the understanding of synthetic lethal interactions and promotes the application of genetic interactions in further cancer precision medicine.""","""['Li Guo', 'Sunjing Li', 'Bowen Qian', 'Youquan Wang', 'Rui Duan', 'Wenwen Jiang', 'Yihao Kang', 'Yuyang Dou', 'Guowei Yang', 'Lulu Shen', 'Jun Wang', 'Tingming Liang']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Comput Struct Biotechnol J""","""['Rewired functional regulatory networks among miRNA isoforms (isomiRs) from let-7 and miR-10 gene families in cancer.', 'Identification of SHCBP1 as a potential biomarker involving diagnosis, prognosis, and tumor immune microenvironment across\xa0multiple\xa0cancers.', 'PreMSIm: An R package for predicting microsatellite instability from the expression profiling of a gene panel in cancer.', 'The cancer driver genes IDH1/2, JARID1C/ KDM5C, and UTX/ KDM6A: crosstalk between histone demethylation and hypoxic reprogramming in cancer metabolism.', 'Good or not good: Role of miR-18a in cancer biology.', 'Omics Overview of the SPARC Gene in Mesothelioma.', 'The Role of Biomarkers in Adrenocortical Carcinoma: A Review of Current Evidence and Future Perspectives.']"""

The primary modes of treatment today include surgical excision (lumpectomy, mastectomy), radiation, chemoablation, anti-HER2/neu therapy, and/or hormone therapy. The severe side effects associated with these therapies suggest a minimally invasive therapy with fewer quality of life issues would be advantageous for treatment of this pervasive disease. Cryoablation has been used in the treatment of other cancers, including prostate, skin, and cervical, for decades and has been shown to be a successful minimally invasive therapeutic option. To this end, the use of cryotherapy for the treatment of breast cancer has increased over the last several years. Although successful, one of the challenges in cryoablation is management of cancer destruction in the periphery of the ice ball as the tissue within this outer margin may not experience ablative temperatures. In breast cancer, this is of concern due to the lobular nature of the tumors. As such, in this study, we investigated the level of cell death at various temperatures associated with the margin of a cryogenic lesion as well as the impact of repetitive freezing and thawing methods on overall efficacy.  Methods:   Human breast cancer cells, MCF-7, were exposed to temperatures of -5°C, -10°C, -15°C, -20°C, or -25°C for 5-minute freeze intervals in a single or repeat freeze-thaw cycle. Samples were thawed with either passive or active warming for 5 or 10 minutes. Samples were assessed at 1, 2, and 3 days post-freeze to assess cell survival and recovery. In addition, the modes of cell death associated with freezing were assessed over the initial 24-hour post-thaw recovery period.  Results:   Exposure of MCF-7 cells to -5°C and -10°C resulted in minimal cell death regardless of the freeze/thaw conditions. Freezing to a temperature of -25°C resulted in complete cell death 1 day post-thaw with no cell recovery in all freeze/thaw scenarios evaluated. Exposure to a single freeze event resulted in a gradual increase in cell death at -15°C and -20°C. Application of a repeat freeze-thaw cycle (dual 5-minute freeze) resulted in an increase in cell death with complete destruction at -20°C and near complete death at -15°C (day 1 survival: single -15°C freeze/thaw = 20%; repeated -15°C freeze/thaw = 4%). Analysis of thaw interval time (5 vs 10 minute) demonstrated that the shorter 5-minute thaw interval between freezes resulted in increased cell destruction. Furthermore, investigation of thaw rate (active vs passive thawing) demonstrated that active thawing resulted in increased cell survival thereby less effective ablation compared with passive thawing (eg, -15°C 5/10/5 procedure survival, passive thaw: 4% vs active thaw: 29%).  Conclusions:   In summary, these in vitro findings suggest that freezing to temperatures of 25°C results in a high degree of breast cancer cell destruction. Furthermore, the data demonstrate that the application of a repeat freeze procedure with a passive 5-minute or 10-minute thaw interval between freeze cycles increases the minimal lethal temperature to the -15°C to -20°C range. The data also demonstrate that the use of an active thawing procedure between freezes reduces ablation efficacy at temperatures associated with the iceball periphery. These findings may be important to improving future clinical applications of cryoablation for the treatment of breast cancer.""","""['Kristi K Snyder', 'Robert G Van Buskirk', 'John G Baust', 'John M Baust']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Breast Cancer (Auckl)""","""['Cryosurgical technique: assessment of the fundamental variables using human prostate cancer model systems.', 'Effect of freezing parameters (freeze cycle and thaw process) on tissue destruction following renal cryoablation.', 'Cryoablation of renal cancer: variables involved in freezing-induced cell death.', 'Cryoablation: physical and molecular basis with putative immunological consequences.', 'Mechanisms of tissue injury in cryosurgery.', 'Feasibility and Safety of Single-Probe Cryoablation with Liquid Nitrogen: An Initial Experience in 24 Various Tumor Lesions.', 'Inhibition of aquaporins as a potential adjunct to breast cancer cryotherapy.']"""

However, the clinical significance and role of miR-199b-5p in PCa remain unclear.  Methods:   The current study sought to investigate the expression status of miR-199b-5p in PCa and the involved molecular mechanisms in PCa metastasis by using bioinformatics analyses, loss-and gain-of-functions and rescue experiments in vitro and in vivo.  Results:   We demonstrated that miR-199b-5p was significantly downregulated in metastatic PCa tissues and cells when compared with the normal prostate tissue, the localised disease, the weakly metastatic and androgen-dependent PCa cell and the normal prostate epithelial cell. We also found that miR-199b-5p drastically suppressed PCa cell proliferation, migration and invasion in vitro and inhibited xenografts tumour growth and metastasis in vivo. Mechanistically, our results showed that miR-199b-5p could inhibit discoidin domain receptor tyrosine kinase 1 (DDR1) expression by directly targeting its 3'-UTR, thereby hindering epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-associated traits, which were induced by DDR1 activating ERK signalling pathway. Moreover, PCa patients with low miR-199b-5p expression level had a remarkably shorter overall survival than those with high miR-199b-5p level, indicating an association of miR-199b-5p loss with poor prognosis in patients with PCa. Furthermore, DDR1 was upregulated in PCa, and significantly correlated with high Gleason score, advanced pathological stage, tumour metastasis and shorter overall survival.  Conclusions:   Our study, for the first time, provide evidence of a tumour-suppressive function of miR-199b-5p in the invasion and metastasis of PCa, supporting the translational exploitation of miR-199b-5p-based therapeutic approaches for PCa metastases. Also, the miR-199b-5p-DDR1-ERK signalling axis identified in this study represents a novel mechanism of regulating EMT in PCa metastases.""","""['Zhigang Zhao#', 'Shankun Zhao#', 'Lianmin Luo#', 'Qian Xiang#', 'Zhiguo Zhu', 'Jiamin Wang', 'Yangzhou Liu', 'Jintai Luo']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Br J Cancer""","""['Correction: miR-199b-5p-DDR1-ERK signalling axis suppresses prostate cancer metastasis via inhibiting epithelial-mesenchymal transition.', 'Comment on ""miR-199b-5p-DDR1-ERK signalling axis suppresses prostate cancer metastasis via inhibiting epithelial-mesenchymal transition"".', 'Reply to Comment on ""miR-199b-5p-DDR1-ERK signalling axis suppresses prostate cancer metastasis via inhibiting epithelial-mesenchymal transition"".', 'Loss of exosomal miR-146a-5p from cancer-associated fibroblasts after androgen deprivation therapy contributes to prostate cancer metastasis.', 'NSD2 circular RNA promotes metastasis of colorectal cancer by targeting miR-199b-5p-mediated DDR1 and JAG1 signalling.', 'MicroRNA-199b-5p attenuates TGF-β1-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition in hepatocellular carcinoma.', 'Prognostic and clinicopathological value of miR-199b in cancers: a\xa0meta-analysis.', 'Cancer Stemness/Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition Axis Influences Metastasis and Castration Resistance in Prostate Cancer: Potential Therapeutic Target.', 'Receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors in cancer.', 'A network map of discoidin domain receptor 1(DDR1)-mediated signaling in pathological conditions.', 'Collagen XV mediated the epithelial-mesenchymal transition to inhibit hepatocellular carcinoma metastasis.', 'The Potential of MicroRNAs as Non-Invasive Prostate Cancer Biomarkers: A Systematic Literature Review Based on a Machine Learning Approach.', 'Histone methyltransferase KMT2C plays an oncogenic role in prostate cancer.']"""

Methods:   We conducted a retrospective matched cohort study using population-based administrative data from Manitoba and Ontario, Canada. We applied a validated case definition to identify MS cases, then selected 5 controls without MS matched on birth year, sex, and region. We linked these cohorts to cancer registries, and estimated incidence of breast, colorectal, and 13 other cancers. For breast and colorectal cancers, we constructed Cox models adjusting for age at the index date, area-level socioeconomic status, region, birth cohort year, and comorbidity. We pooled findings across provinces using meta-analysis.  Results:   We included 53,983 MS cases and 269,915 controls. Multivariable analyses showed no difference in breast cancer risk (pooled hazard ratio [HR] 0.92 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.78-1.09]) or colorectal cancer risk (pooled HR 0.83 [95% CI 0.64-1.07]) between the cohorts. Mortality rates for breast and colorectal did not differ between cohorts. Bladder cancer incidence and mortality rates were higher among the MS cohort. Although the incidence of prostate, uterine, and CNS cancers differed between the MS and matched cohorts, mortality rates did not.  Conclusion:   The incidence of breast and colorectal cancers does not differ between persons with and without MS; however, the incidence of bladder cancer is increased.

Nadofaragene firadenovec (also known as rAd-IFNa/Syn3) is a replication-deficient recombinant adenovirus that delivers human interferon alfa-2b cDNA into the bladder epithelium, and a novel intravesical therapy for BCG-unresponsive non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer. We aimed to evaluate its efficacy in patients with BCG-unresponsive non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer.  Methods:   In this phase 3, multicentre, open-label, repeat-dose study done in 33 centres (hospitals and clinics) in the USA, we recruited patients aged 18 years or older, with BCG-unresponsive non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group status of 2 or less. Patients were excluded if they had upper urinary tract disease, urothelial carcinoma within the prostatic urethra, lymphovascular invasion, micropapillary disease, or hydronephrosis. Eligible patients received a single intravesical 75 mL dose of nadofaragene firadenovec (3 × 1011 viral particles per mL). Repeat dosing at months 3, 6, and 9 was done in the absence of high-grade recurrence. The primary endpoint was complete response at any time in patients with carcinoma in situ (with or without a high-grade Ta or T1 tumour). The null hypothesis specified a complete response rate of less than 27% in this cohort. Efficacy analyses were done on the per-protocol population, to include only patients strictly meeting the BCG-unresponsive definition. Safety analyses were done in all patients who received at least one dose of treatment. The study is ongoing, with a planned 4-year treatment and monitoring phase. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02773849.  Findings:   Between Sept 19, 2016, and May 24, 2019, 198 patients were assessed for eligibility. 41 patients were excluded, and 157 were enrolled and received at least one dose of the study drug. Six patients did not meet the definition of BCG-unresponsive non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer and were therefore excluded from efficacy analyses; the remaining 151 patients were included in the per-protocol efficacy analyses. 55 (53·4%) of 103 patients with carcinoma in situ (with or without a high-grade Ta or T1 tumour) had a complete response within 3 months of the first dose and this response was maintained in 25 (45·5%) of 55 patients at 12 months. Micturition urgency was the most common grade 3-4 study drug-related adverse event (two [1%] of 157 patients, both grade 3), and there were no treatment-related deaths.  Interpretation:   Intravesical nadofaragene firadenovec was efficacious, with a favourable benefit:risk ratio, in patients with BCG-unresponsive non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer.

Methods:   This study used a large medical claims clearinghouse database representing 5%-7% of the Medicare fee-for-service population to characterize changes in the utilization of cancer care services and gain insight into the impact of COVID-19 on the US cancer population, including identification of new patients, gaps in access to care, and disruption of treatment journeys.  Results:   In March-July 2020, in comparison with the baseline period of March-July 2019, there is a substantial decrease in cancer screenings, visits, therapy, and surgeries, with variation by cancer type and site of service. At the peak of the pandemic in April, screenings for breast, colon, prostate, and lung cancers were lower by 85%, 75%, 74%, and 56%, respectively. Significant utilization reductions were observed in April for hospital outpatient evaluation and management (E&M) visits (-74%), new patient E&M visits (-70%), and established patient E&M visits (-60%). A decrease in billing frequency was observed for the top physician-administered oncology products, dropping in both April (-26%) and July (-31%). Mastectomies were reduced consistently in April through July, with colectomies similarly reduced in April and May and prostatectomies dipping in April and July.

Using data from a large prospective full-cohort with standardised assays and repeat blood measurements, and genetic data from an international consortium, we investigated the associations of circulating IGF-I, sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), and total and calculated free testosterone concentrations with prostate cancer incidence and mortality. For prospective analyses, risk was estimated using multivariable-adjusted Cox regression in 199 698 male UK Biobank participants. Hazard ratios (HRs) were corrected for regression dilution bias using repeat hormone measurements from a subsample. Two-sample Mendelian randomisation (MR) analysis of IGF-I and risk used genetic instruments identified from UK Biobank men and genetic outcome data from the PRACTICAL consortium (79 148 cases and 61 106 controls). We used cis- and all (cis and trans) SNP MR approaches. A total of 5402 men were diagnosed with and 295 died from prostate cancer (mean follow-up 6.9 years). Higher circulating IGF-I was associated with elevated prostate cancer diagnosis (HR per 5 nmol/L increment = 1.09, 95% CI 1.05-1.12) and mortality (HR per 5 nmol/L increment = 1.15, 1.02-1.29). MR analyses also supported the role of IGF-I in prostate cancer diagnosis (cis-MR odds ratio per 5 nmol/L increment = 1.34, 1.07-1.68). In observational analyses, higher free testosterone was associated with a higher risk of prostate cancer (HR per 50 pmol/L increment = 1.10, 1.05-1.15). Higher SHBG was associated with a lower risk (HR per 10 nmol/L increment = 0.95, 0.94-0.97), neither was associated with prostate cancer mortality.

This process puts additional time burdens on oncologists and introduces variability among both experts and institutions.  Objective:   To explore clinically acceptable autocontouring solutions that can be integrated into existing workflows and used in different domains of radiotherapy.  Design, setting, and participants:   This quality improvement study used a multicenter imaging data set comprising 519 pelvic and 242 head and neck computed tomography (CT) scans from 8 distinct clinical sites and patients diagnosed either with prostate or head and neck cancer. The scans were acquired as part of treatment dose planning from patients who received intensity-modulated radiation therapy between October 2013 and February 2020. Fifteen different OARs were manually annotated by expert readers and radiation oncologists. The models were trained on a subset of the data set to automatically delineate OARs and evaluated on both internal and external data sets. Data analysis was conducted October 2019 to September 2020.  Main outcomes and measures:   The autocontouring solution was evaluated on external data sets, and its accuracy was quantified with volumetric agreement and surface distance measures. Models were benchmarked against expert annotations in an interobserver variability (IOV) study. Clinical utility was evaluated by measuring time spent on manual corrections and annotations from scratch.  Results:   A total of 519 participants' (519 [100%] men; 390 [75%] aged 62-75 years) pelvic CT images and 242 participants' (184 [76%] men; 194 [80%] aged 50-73 years) head and neck CT images were included. The models achieved levels of clinical accuracy within the bounds of expert IOV for 13 of 15 structures (eg, left femur, κ = 0.982; brainstem, κ = 0.806) and performed consistently well across both external and internal data sets (eg, mean [SD] Dice score for left femur, internal vs external data sets: 98.52% [0.50] vs 98.04% [1.02]; P = .04). The correction time of autogenerated contours on 10 head and neck and 10 prostate scans was measured as a mean of 4.98 (95% CI, 4.44-5.52) min/scan and 3.40 (95% CI, 1.60-5.20) min/scan, respectively, to ensure clinically accepted accuracy. Manual segmentation of the head and neck took a mean 86.75 (95% CI, 75.21-92.29) min/scan for an expert reader and 73.25 (95% CI, 68.68-77.82) min/scan for a radiation oncologist. The autogenerated contours represented a 93% reduction in time.  Conclusions and relevance:   In this study, the models achieved levels of clinical accuracy within expert IOV while reducing manual contouring time and performing consistently well across previously unseen heterogeneous data sets. With the availability of open-source libraries and reliable performance, this creates significant opportunities for the transformation of radiation treatment planning.""","""['Ozan Oktay', 'Jay Nanavati', 'Anton Schwaighofer', 'David Carter', 'Melissa Bristow', 'Ryutaro Tanno', 'Rajesh Jena', 'Gill Barnett', 'David Noble', 'Yvonne Rimmer', 'Ben Glocker', ""Kenton O'Hara"", 'Christopher Bishop', 'Javier Alvarez-Valle', 'Aditya Nori']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""JAMA Netw Open""","""['Error in Abstract.', 'Fully automatic multi-organ segmentation for head and neck cancer radiotherapy using shape representation model constrained fully convolutional neural networks.', 'Improving automatic delineation for head and neck organs at risk by Deep Learning Contouring.', 'AAR-RT - A system for auto-contouring organs at risk on CT images for radiation therapy planning: Principles, design, and large-scale evaluation on head-and-neck and thoracic cancer cases.', 'Auto-segmentation of organs at risk for head and neck radiotherapy planning: From atlas-based to deep learning methods.', 'Use of auto-segmentation in the delineation of target volumes and organs at risk in head and neck.', ""Clinical Validation of Siemens' Syngo.via Automatic Contouring System."", 'Deep Learning-Based Segmentation of Head and Neck Organs-at-Risk with Clinical Partially Labeled Data.', 'Evaluating the Effectiveness of Deep Learning Contouring across Multiple Radiotherapy Centres.', 'Deep learning empowered volume delineation of whole-body organs-at-risk for accelerated radiotherapy.', 'Demystifying Supervised Learning in Healthcare 4.0: A New Reality of Transforming Diagnostic Medicine.']"""

Recent guidance change recommends Ra-223 following at least two prior therapies for mCRPC. We evaluated how this change affects overall survival and the optimal timing of Ra-223 in the mCRPC treatment pathway.  Methods:   Retrospective analysis of all mCRPC patients receiving Ra-223 therapy at a single UK centre over a 70-month period. Overall survival, number of prior lines of therapy commenced before Ra-223 initiation and number of Ra-223 therapy cycles completed were identified.  Results:   One hundred ninety-one mCRPC patients received Ra-223 therapy during the study period. One hundred twenty-one (63%) received one prior therapy (group 1) and 70 (37%) received two prior therapies (group 2). Median survival in group 1 was significantly improved, compared to group 2 (448 days vs. 341 days (P = 0.03). Subgroup analysis of 111/191 (58%) patients that completed the recommended six Ra-223 therapy cycles showed additional improved survival. Median survival in group 1 was incrementally significantly improved, compared to group 2 within these patients (665 days vs. 552 days; P = 0.05). There was no difference in the number of patients completing the recommenced six cycles of therapy between the groups [72/121 (59%) vs. 39/70 (56%); P = 0.61].  Conclusion:   We found a significant survival benefit when Ra-223 was used earlier in the mCRPC treatment pathway, with additional survival advantage seen in those patients completing all six Ra-223 cycles.

Methods:   Prostate mpMRI examinations of 114 patients were evaluated retrospectively. T2-weighted sequences in the axial and sagittal planes were used for the measurement of the prostate volume. The measurements were performed by two independent observers as recommended in the PI-RADS v2 and PI-RADS v2.1 guidelines. Both observers conducted the measurements twice and the average values were obtained. In order to prevent bias, the observers carried out measurements at one-week intervals. In order to assess intraobserver variability, observers repeated the measurements again at one-week intervals. The prostate volume was calculated using the ellipsoid formula (W×H×L×0.52).  Results:   Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) revealed almost perfect agreement between the first and second observers for the measurements according to both PI-RADS v2 (0.93) and PI-RADS v2.1 (0.96) guidelines. The measurements were repeated by both observers.

However, the degree of financial burden imposed by treatment, the factors contributing to that burden, and how different treatments compare with regard to financial toxicity remain poorly understood.  Materials and methods:   The Comparative Effectiveness Analysis of Surgery and Radiation (CEASAR) study enrolled men with localized prostate cancer from 2011 to 2012.

Methods:   We enrolled 200 patients who underwent radical prostatectomy at our department between 12/2017 and 04/2019. We evaluated tumour location in the individual segments of the prostate, index tumour location and volume, and compared the postoperative stage, Gleason score, grade group (GG), and the presence of extraprostatic extension (EPE) in APC and posterior prostate cancer (PPC). We assessed the rate of MRI scans prior to prostate surgery as well as the influence of family history and PSA on the presence of APC.  Results:   We found a significantly higher rate of anterior tumours than previously reported (37%) and confirmed that these tumours are diagnosed with a significantly larger index tumour volume (P=0.003). We also showed that a mere 6.76% of APCs were low-risk tumours not requiring radical treatment. Furthermore, anterior tumours were found significantly more often (P=0.001) in patients who underwent preoperative MRI. No differences were observed between PSA values, family history, presence of EPE, or locally advanced disease in APC vs. PPC.  Conclusions:   The frequency of anterior tumours is higher than previously thought, and they include tumours requiring radical treatment. When these tumours are neglected, it may lead to patient undertreatment with impact on their life prognosis.

Reactome and STRING analysis of array data identified interleukin-6, interleukin-8, nuclear factor kappa B, signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 and cyclooxygenase 2 as chief instigators of prostatic anomaly, which were found to be significantly upregulated by immunofluorescence and western blotting analyses. STRING further connected these instigators with macrophage migration inhibitory factor, PIM-1 and prostate-specific antigen; which was confirmed by their marked stimulation in infected prostatic cells by immunoblotting and immunocytochemistry. Upregulated proliferation markers, such as Ki67, proliferating cell nuclear antigen and B-cell lymphoma 2, suggested tumor-like signaling in infected RWPE-1 cells, which was further supported by downregulation of E-cadherin, upregulation of vimentin and activation of focal adhesion kinase. Prostate tumor DU145 cells were more sensitive to parasite invasion, and showed rapid upregulation with nuclear translocation of sensitive parameters, such as nuclear factor kappa B, signal transducer and activator of transcription 3, and macrophage migration inhibitory factor. The migration of DU145 cells augmented when incubated in spent media from parasite-infected RWPE-1 cells.  Conclusion:   The initiation of inflammation driven tumor-like cell signaling in parasite-infected human prostatic epithelial cells is apparent, with the prostate tumor (DU145) cells being more sensitive to T. vaginalis than normal (RWPE-1) prostatic cells.""","""['Bhavana Kushwaha', 'Archana Devi', 'Jagdamba P Maikhuri', 'Singh Rajender', 'Gopal Gupta']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Int J Urol""","""['Inflammatory mediators of prostate epithelial cells stimulated with Trichomonas vaginalis promote proliferative and invasive properties of prostate cancer cells.', 'IL-6 produced by prostate epithelial cells stimulated with Trichomonas vaginalis\xa0promotes proliferation of prostate cancer cells by inducing M2 polarization of THP-1-derived macrophages.', 'Inflammatory Responses in a Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia Epithelial Cell Line (BPH-1) Infected with Trichomonas vaginalis.', 'Inflammatory response to Trichomonas vaginalis in the pathogenesis of prostatitis and benign prostatic hyperplasia.', 'The Role of Purinergic Signaling in Trichomonas vaginalis Infection.', 'Preclinical models and evaluation criteria of prostatitis.', 'Insights into the Human Microbiome and Its Connections with Prostate Cancer.', 'Infinity war: Trichomonas vaginalis and interactions with host immune response.', 'The correlation between Trichomonas vaginalis infection and reproductive system cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Double-Stranded RNA Viruses Are Released From Trichomonas vaginalis Inside Small Extracellular Vesicles and Modulate the Exosomal Cargo.']"""

Materials and methods:   In Study 1, the metrics, i.e. 12 phases of the procedure, 81 steps, 245 errors and 110 critical errors for a reference RARP were developed and then presented to an international Delphi panel of 19 experienced urologists. In Study 2, 12 very experienced surgeons (VES) who had performed >500 RARPs and 12 novice urology surgeons performed a RARP, which was video recorded and assessed by two experienced urologists blinded as to subject and group. Percentage agreement between experienced urologists for the Delphi meeting and Mann-Whitney U- and Kruskal-Wallis tests were used for construct validation of the newly identified RARP metrics.  Results:   At the Delphi panel, consensus was reached on the appropriateness of the metrics for a reference RARP. In Study 2, the results showed that the VES performed ~4% more procedure steps and made 72% fewer procedure errors than the novices (P = 0.027). Phases VIIa and VIIb (i.e. neurovascular bundle dissection) best discriminated between the VES and novices.  Limitations:   VES whose performance was in the bottom half of their group demonstrated considerable error variability and made five-times as many errors as the other half of the group (P = 0.006).

Analyses of Gene Expression Omnibus data and human tissue samples indicated that levels of matrix metallopeptidase 13 (MMP-13) expression are higher in prostate cancer patients than in healthy cancer-free individuals. Mechanistic investigations revealed that melatonin inhibits MMP-13 expression and the migratory and invasive capacities of prostate cancer cells via the MT1 receptor and the phospholipase C, p38, and c-Jun signaling cascades. Importantly, tumor growth rate and metastasis to distant organs were suppressed by melatonin in an orthotopic prostate cancer model.

Patients under 65 show substantial increases in utilization of expensive targeted therapy anticancer agents; however, patients aged 65+ account for the majority of new malignancies. Utilization and cost trends for these emerging agents have not been examined in detail in the Medicare population.  Patients and methods:   Retrospective prevalent cohort analysis of patients 65+ with any stage of invasive lung, breast, colorectal, or prostate cancer, receiving systemic therapy drawn from the United States Medicare 5% fee-for-service sample claims (2005-2015). Yearly trends in utilization and associated costs were modeled with adjustment for inflation, demographics, and comorbidities.  Results:   Among Medicare beneficiaries with fee-for-service and Part D enrollment who were receiving some type of systemic anticancer therapy, there were 9230 patients with colorectal, 32,738 patients with breast, and 16,278 patients with lung cancers identified from 2006 to 2015, and 19,295 patients with prostate cancer from 2009 to 2015.

Although the proportion of patients receiving targeted therapies remained stable, mean per-patient cancer costs increased dramatically from 2006 to 2015 for patients with lung or prostate cancer receiving targeted therapy and for patients with breast cancer receiving non-hormonal targeted therapies.

Upper tract urothelial carcinoma (UTUC) shares similar pathological features, but current formulations are not suitable for direct instillation to the upper urinary tract.  Objective:   To evaluate in vivo applicability, characteristics and toxicity of ST-UC, a mucoadhesive polymeric paste formulation of gemcitabine, for upper urinary tract instillation.  Material and methods:   Three pigs received 10 ml of ST-UC (100 mg/ml gemcitabine) retrogradely into 1 renal pelvis for pharmacokinetic studies. Four days later, a second injection into the contralateral renal pelvis was followed by serial euthanasia of the pigs and nephroureterectomy after 1, 3, and 6 hours. Adverse effects were monitored. Urine, serum, and tissue gemcitabine concentrations were measured, along with histologic examination of the upper urinary tract.  Results:   Retrograde instillation of ST-UC was well tolerated with mild, completely receding hydronephrosis. Urine gemcitabine concentrations were highest in the first 3-hour collection interval. Hundred percent of gemcitabine was recovered in the urine within 24 hours. Serum peak concentrations (cmax) of gemcitabine were low at 5.5 µg/ml compared to the 10 to 30 µg/ml levels observed after a single intravenous dose of 1,000 mg/m2 gemcitabine. The formulation was still traceable after one hour and gemcitabine tissue concentrations are supportive of this extended drug exposure. No major histopathological changes were observed. The main limitation of this study is the lack of antitumor activity data.

Staging was performed with conventional imaging: a computed tomography (CT) scan showed the presence of two enlarged lymph nodes on the left, close to the external iliac vessels. In addition, a suspicious 15-mm metastatic lesion was detected in the left pubic bone. This lesion was confirmed on the bone scan, without further metastatic lesions. In the context of a clinical trial, after an initial course of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), the patient was treated with robot-assisted radical prostatectomy and extended pelvic lymph node dissection (histopathological examination: ypT3b pN1 R1). Postprostatectomy radiation therapy was delivered on prostatic bed (70Gy), pelvic lymph node area (54Gy), and pubic bone (51Gy). ADT was scheduled for a total period of 36 mo. Currently, the patient is still receiving ADT, which will be completed within 6 mo. The last prostate-specific antigen level was undetectable. The discussion is focused on the following three open questions: (1) Would molecular imaging (eg, prostate-specific membrane antigen positron emission tomography/CT) change the therapeutic approach to the patient? (2) Is there a role for local treatment in the metastatic setting? (iii) Should metastasis-directed therapy be considered for this patient?

Methods:   This monocentric prospective pilot study, running from June 2018 to June 2019, included 10 patients with low-risk PC under AS, median age 72 years (range, 62-77 years), with a unilateral focal lesion visible on magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, with Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System v2 score ≥3/5 confirmed by multiparametric MR imaging-targeted biopsy and Gleason score 6. The patients underwent unilateral prostatic artery embolization with 300-500 μm Embospheres in the affected prostatic lobe. The primary endpoint was technical feasibility (prostate and no off-target ischemia in the imaging). The secondary endpoints included safety, negative biopsies/MR imaging response/functional outcomes at 6 months, and oncologic efficacy at 1 year.  Results:   Embolization was successfully achieved in all patients; prostate ischemia was confirmed on multiparametric MR imaging, and no off-target ischemia was reported. No major complications were reported. Four patients (40%) presented with both negative targeted and systematic biopsies at 6 months. No lesions were seen on the MR imaging in 30% of patients. The mean International Prostate Symptom Score and International Index of Erectile Function score were 7 and 19 and 5 and 20 at baseline and 6 months, respectively, with no significant difference.

In the present study, we used RT-qPCR to detect the expression of GASL1 in esophageal cancer cell carcinoma (ESCC) cell lines, and constructed the overexpression and interference plasmids of GASL1 and the interference plasmid of DKK1. CCK8 was used to detect the cell proliferation level, clone formation experiment was used to detect the cell clonal formation ability, flow cytometry was used to detect the cell cycle level, and wound healing and Transwell experiments were respectively used to detect the cell invasion and migration. The interference and overexpression plasmids of GASL1 were injected into mice subcutaneously for tumor-bearing experiment. The body weight, tumor growth curve, and tumor weight of mice were recorded, and western blot was used to detect the expression of proliferation-, invasion-, and migration-related proteins and the expression of Wnt3a/β-catenin signal-related proteins in tumor tissues. LncRNA GASL1 was down-regulated in ESCC cell lines, and GASL1 inhibited ESCC cell progression and regulated cell cycle arrest in ESCC cells. In vivo, GASL1 inhibited tumor growth. GASL1 decreased the protein levels of DDK1, Wnt3a, β-catenin, and c-MYC in ESCC cell lines. Interfering DKK1 activates Wnt3a/β--catenin signal to reverse the inhibitory effects of GASL1 on proliferation, cell cycle acceleration, invasion, and migration.

Methods:   We used patient-level data from Veterans Health Administration electronic medical records to identify men (age ≥40 years) diagnosed with prostate cancer between 2004 and 2014. We used Fine and Gray regression model to estimate the risk for competing mortality outcomes (suicide, non-suicide, and alive). We used structural equation models to evaluate the mediating factors.  Results:   Our cohort comprised 214,649 men with prostate cancer, of whom 12,208 (5.7%) had a preexisting PTSD diagnosis. Patients with PTSD compared to those without utilized more healthcare services and had lower risk cancer at diagnosis. Additionally, they experienced more suicide deaths (N = 26, 0.21% vs. N = 269, 0.13%) and fewer non-suicide deaths (N = 1399, 11.5% vs. N = 45,625, 22.5%). On multivariable analysis, PTSD was an independent suicide risk factor (HR = 2.35; 95% CI: 1.16, 4.78). Depression, substance use disorder, and any definitive prostate cancer treatment were partial mediators. However, PTSD was associated with lower non-suicide mortality risk (HR = 0.86; 95% CI: 0.77, 0.96).  Conclusion:   Patients with PTSD experienced greater suicide risk even after adjusting for important mediators. They may have experienced lower non-suicide mortality risk due to favorable physical health resulting from greater healthcare service use and early diagnosis of lower risk cancer.

This study analyzed differences in cancer mortality between metropolitan and non-metropolitan areas in Japan, using an age-period-cohort (APC) analysis.  Methods:   Data on cancer mortality from 1999 to 2018 for metropolitan and non-metropolitan areas in Japan were used. Here metropolitan areas were defined as government ordinance-designated municipalities in 1999 and special wards of Tokyo. In addition to general mortality data for all cancer sites, data on mortality for stomach, colorectal, liver, gallbladder, pancreatic, lung, prostate, and breast cancers were used for analysis. A Bayesian APC analysis was administered to the data for each type of cancer for area and for sex-distinguished data. Additionally, the ratios for estimated mortality rate by periods and cohorts between the two areas were calculated.  Results:   The age-standardized mortality rate for cancer in all sites in non-metropolitan areas was lower than that in metropolitan areas throughout the analyzed years for both men and women, but the mortality difference decreased during the periods for men. The rates of decrease in mortality rate in cohorts differed for some cancers between the two area types, and the mortality rate ratios of metropolitan compared with non-metropolitan areas decreased for cancer in all sites over the analyzed cohorts for men. Also, the rate of decrease in mortality rate over the cohorts was completely different between the areas for stomach cancer in men and for liver cancer for women.  Conclusion:   Mortality rates for cancer in all sites tended to diverge between the two area types in younger cohorts for men, and people in younger cohorts in non-metropolitan areas should take more extensive preventive measures against cancer than their counterparts in metropolitan areas.""","""['Tasuku Okui']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Asian Pac J Cancer Prev""","""['Age-Period-Cohort Analysis of the Sex Differences in Cancer Mortality Rates in Japan from 1995 to 2015.', 'An analysis of disparities in the changes of cancer mortality rates among prefectures in Japan using age-period-cohort analysis.', 'State of health of populations residing in geothermal areas of Tuscany.', 'Mortality Atlas of the Campania Region.

Methods:   This is a retrospective observational cohort study among men with BCR PCa from June 2018 to May 2019. Multivariate logistic regression models were employed to analyze the primary outcome: receipt of molecular imaging (e.g. Fluciclovine PET and Prostate Specific Membrane Antigen PET) as part of diagnostic work-up for BCR PCa. Multivariate linear regression models were used to analyze the secondary outcome: overall healthcare cost within a 1-year time frame.  Results:   The study sample included 234 patients; 79.1% White, 2.1% Black, 8.5% Asian/Pacific Islander, and 10.3% Other. The majority were 55 years or older (97.9%) and publicly insured (74.8%). Analysis indicated a one-unit reduction in PSA is associated with 1.3 times higher likelihood of receiving molecular imaging (p < 0.01). Analysis found that privately insured patients were associated with approximately $500,000 more in hospital reimbursement (p < 0.01) as compared to the publicly insured. Additionally, a one-unit increase in PSA is associated with $6254 increase in hospital reimbursement or an increase in total payments by 2.1% (p < 0.05).

Unfortunately, current medical treatments fail to prevent PCa progression in a high percentage of cases; therefore, new therapeutic tools to tackle PCa are urgently needed. Biguanides and statins have emerged as antitumor agents for several endocrine-related cancers.  Objective:   To evaluate: (1) the putative in vivo association between metformin and/or statins treatment and key tumor and clinical parameters and (2) the direct effects of different biguanides (metformin/buformin/phenformin), statins (atorvastatin/simvastatin/lovastatin), and their combination, on key functional endpoints and associated signalling mechanisms.  Methods:   An exploratory/observational retrospective cohort of patients with PCa (n = 75) was analyzed. Moreover, normal and tumor prostate cells (normal [RWPE-cells/primary prostate cell cultures]; tumor [LNCaP/22RV1/PC3/DU145 cell lines]) were used to measure proliferation/migration/tumorsphere-formation/signalling pathways.  Results:   The combination of metformin+statins in vivo was associated to lower Gleason score and longer biochemical recurrence-free survival. Moreover, biguanides and statins exerted strong antitumor actions (ie, inhibition of proliferation/migration/tumorsphere formation) on PCa cells, and that their combination further decreased; in addition, these functional parameters compared with the individual treatments. These actions were mediated through modulation of key oncogenic and metabolic signalling pathways (ie, AR/mTOR/AMPK/AKT/ERK) and molecular mediators (MKI67/cMYC/androgen receptor/cell-cycle inhibitors).  Conclusions:   Biguanides and statins significantly reduced tumor aggressiveness in PCa, with this effect being more potent (in vitro and in vivo) when both compounds are combined. Therefore, given the demonstrated clinical safety of biguanides and statins, our results suggest a potential therapeutic role of these compounds, especially their combination, for the treatment of PCa.""","""['Juan M Jiménez-Vacas', 'Vicente Herrero-Aguayo', 'Antonio J Montero-Hidalgo', 'Prudencio Sáez-Martínez', 'Enrique Gómez-Gómez', 'Antonio J León-González', 'Antonio C Fuentes-Fayos', 'Elena M Yubero-Serrano', 'María J Requena-Tapia', 'Miguel López', 'Justo P Castaño', 'Manuel D Gahete', 'Raúl M Luque']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""J Clin Endocrinol Metab""","""['Metformin and simvastatin exert additive antitumour effects in glioblastoma via senescence-state: clinical and translational evidence.', 'Type 2 Diabetes in Neuroendocrine Tumors: Are Biguanides and Statins Part of the Solution?', 'Anticancer efficacy of simvastatin on prostate cancer cells and tumor xenografts is associated with inhibition of Akt and reduced prostate-specific antigen expression.', 'The anticancer potential of metformin on prostate cancer.', 'Therapeutic Repurposing of Biguanides in Cancer.', 'Metformin and simvastatin exert additive antitumour effects in glioblastoma via senescence-state: clinical and translational evidence.', 'Unraveling the Peculiar Features of Mitochondrial Metabolism and Dynamics in Prostate Cancer.', 'Statins block mammalian target of rapamycin pathway: a possible novel therapeutic strategy for inflammatory, malignant and neurodegenerative diseases.', 'Somatostatin, Cortistatin and Their Receptors Exert Antitumor Actions in Androgen-Independent Prostate Cancer Cells: Critical Role of Endogenous Cortistatin.', 'Review of Under-Recognized Adjunctive Therapies for Cancer.']"""

Methods: The radiochemical synthesis, cell uptake, cell kill, and biodistribution of 213Bi-L1 and 225Ac-L1 were evaluated. The efficacy of 225Ac-L1 was determined in human PSMA+ subcutaneous and micrometastatic models. Subacute toxicity at 8 wk and chronic toxicity at 1 y after administration were evaluated for 225Ac-L1. The absorbed radiation dose of 225Ac-L1 was determined using the biodistribution data and α-camera imaging. Results:213Bi- and 225Ac-L1 demonstrated specific cell uptake and cell kill in PSMA+ cells. The biodistribution of 213Bi-L1 and 225Ac-L1 revealed specific uptake of radioactivity within PSMA+ lesions. Treatment studies of 225Ac-L1 demonstrated activity-dependent, specific inhibition of tumor growth in the PSMA+ flank tumor model. 225Ac-L1 also showed an increased survival benefit in the micrometastatic model compared with 177Lu-L1. Activity-escalated acute and chronic toxicity studies of 225Ac-L1 revealed off-target radiotoxicity, mainly in kidneys and liver. The estimated maximum tolerated activity was about 1 MBq/kg. α-Camera imaging of 225Ac-L1 revealed high renal cortical accumulation at 2 h followed by fast clearance at 24 h. Conclusion:225Ac-L1 demonstrated activity-dependent efficacy with minimal treatment-related organ radiotoxicity. 225Ac-L1 is a promising therapeutic for further clinical evaluation.""","""['Sangeeta Ray Banerjee', 'Ala Lisok', 'Il Minn', 'Anders Josefsson', 'Vivek Kumar', 'Mary Brummet', 'Srikanth Boinapally', 'Cory Brayton', 'Ronnie C Mease', 'George Sgouros', 'Robert F Hobbs', 'Martin G Pomper']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""J Nucl Med""","""['Preclinical Evaluation of 203/212Pb-Labeled Low-Molecular-Weight Compounds for Targeted Radiopharmaceutical Therapy of Prostate Cancer.', '177Lu-labeled low-molecular-weight agents for PSMA-targeted radiopharmaceutical therapy.', 'An Improved 211At-Labeled Agent for PSMA-Targeted α-Therapy.', '(2S)-2-(3-(1-Carboxy-5-(4-211At-Astatobenzamido)Pentyl)Ureido)-Pentanedioic Acid for PSMA-Targeted α-Particle Radiopharmaceutical Therapy.', '225Ac-PSMA-617 for Therapy of Prostate Cancer.', 'Treatment of Prostate Cancer with CD46-targeted 225Ac Alpha Particle Radioimmunotherapy.', '225AcAc-SibuDAB for Targeted Alpha Therapy of Prostate Cancer: Preclinical Evaluation and Comparison with 225AcAc-PSMA-617.', 'PSMA PET-CT in the Diagnosis and Staging of Prostate Cancer.', 'Factors Influencing the Therapeutic Efficacy of the PSMA Targeting Radioligand 212Pb-NG001.', 'A Physiologically Based Pharmacokinetic Model for In Vivo Alpha Particle Generators Targeting Neuroendocrine Tumors in Mice.']"""
