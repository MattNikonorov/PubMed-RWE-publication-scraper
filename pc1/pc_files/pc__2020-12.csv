Questions/purposes:   Our objectives were (I) characterize the epidemiology of de novo bone metastasis with respect to patient demographics, (II) characterize the incidence by primary site, age, and sex (2010-2015), and (III) compare survival of de novo metastatic cancer patients with and without bone metastasis.  Methods:   This is a retrospective, population-based study using nationally representative data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program, 2010-2015. Incidence rates by year of diagnosis, annual percentage changes, Kaplan-Meier, univariate and multiple Cox regression models are included in the analysis.  Results:   Of patients with cancer in the SEER database, 5.1% were diagnosed with metastasis to bone, equaling ~18.8 per 100,000 bone metastasis diagnoses in the US per year (2010-2015). For adults >25, lung cancer is the most common primary site (2015 rate: 8.7 per 100,000) with de novo bone metastases, then prostate and breast primaries (2015 rates: 3.19 and 2.38 per 100,000, respectively). For patients <20 years old, endocrine cancers and soft tissue sarcomas are the most common primaries. Incidence is increasing for prostate (Annual Percentage Change (APC) = 4.6%, P < 0.001) and stomach (APC = 5.0%, P = 0.001) cancers. The presence of de novo bone metastasis was associated with a limited reduction in overall survival (HR = 1.02, 95%, CI = [1.01-1.03], p < 0.001) when compared to patients with other non-bone metastases.  Conclusion:   The presence of bone metastasis versus metastasis to other sites has disease site-specific impact on survival. The incidence of de novo bone metastasis varies by age, sex, and primary disease site.""","""['Casey Ryan', 'Kelsey C Stoltzfus', 'Samantha Horn', 'Hanbo Chen', 'Alexander V Louie', 'Eric J Lehrer', 'Daniel M Trifiletti', 'Edward J Fox', 'John A Abraham', 'Nicholas G Zaorsky']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Bone""","""['The effect of distant metastases sites on survival in de novo stage-IV breast cancer: A SEER database analysis.', 'Prognostic Value of Site-Specific Metastases and Surgery in De Novo Stage IV Triple-Negative Breast Cancer: A Population-Based Analysis.', 'Racial/ethnic disparities in de novo metastases sites and survival outcomes for patients with primary breast, colorectal, and prostate cancer.', 'Prognostic Value of the Site of Distant Metastasis and Surgical Interventions in Metastatic Gastric Cancer: A Population-Based Study.', 'De novo Versus Secondary Dedifferentiated Chordomas: A Population-Based Analysis and Integrated Individual Participant Data Meta-Analysis.', 'Validation of a Diagnostic Model to Differentiate Multiple Myeloma from Bone Metastasis.', 'Prevalence of primary malignant tumours, rates of pathological fracture, and mortality in the setting of metastatic bone disease.', 'Bromocriptine monotherapy overcomes prostate cancer chemoresistance in preclinical models.', 'Future trends in incidence and long-term survival of metastatic cancer in the United States.', 'Bibliometric Analysis of Acupuncture Therapy for Cancer Pain Over the Past 10 Years.']"""

For men with localized prostate cancer managed with primary RT, we evaluated associations between rates of treatment noncompletion and RT fractionation schedules.  Methods and materials:   The National Cancer Database identified men diagnosed from 2004 to 2014 treated with primary RT. Patients receiving 180 cGy/fraction or 200 cGy/fraction were defined as having completed radiation therapy if they received ≥41 fractions of 180 cGy/fraction or ≥37 fractions of 200 cGy/fraction. Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) was defined as 5 to 8 fractions of 600 to 800 cGy/fraction. Odds ratios compared rates of treatment noncompletion, adjusting for sociodemographic covariates. A propensity-adjusted multivariable Cox regression assessed the association between treatment completion and overall survival.  Results:   Of 157,657 patients, 95.7% (n = 150,847) received conventional fractionation and 4.3% (n = 6810) received SBRT. Rates of noncompletion were 12.5% (n = 18,803) among patients who received conventional fractionation and 1.9% (n = 131) among patients who received SBRT (odds ratio [OR] versus conventional, 0.21; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.18-0.26; P < .001). The rate of noncompletion among 25,727 African American patients was 12.8%, compared with 11.8% among 126,199 white patients (OR, 1.14; 95% CI, 1.09-1.19; P < .001). In a subgroup analysis, the disparity in noncompletion persisted for conventional fractionation (13.2% vs 12.3%, respectively; OR, 1.09; 95% CI, 1.05-1.13; P < .001), but not for SBRT (2.2% vs 1.8%, respectively; OR, 1.26; 95% CI, 0.79-2.00; P = .34). Noncompletion was associated with worse survival in a propensity-adjusted multivariable analysis (hazard ratio, 1.25; 95% CI, 1.22-1.29; P < .001).  Conclusions:   SBRT was associated with lower rates of RT noncompletion among men with localized prostate cancer. African American race was associated with greater rates of treatment noncompletion, although the disparity may be decreased among men receiving SBRT.""","""['Edward Christopher Dee', 'Vinayak Muralidhar', 'Melaku A Arega', 'Amar U Kishan', 'Daniel E Spratt', 'Robert T Dess', 'Martin T King', 'Sybil T Sha', 'Patricia Mae G Santos', 'Santino S Butler', 'Nina N Sanford', 'Paul L Nguyen', 'Brandon A Mahal']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys""","""['Shorter Radiation Regimens and Treatment Noncompletion Among Patients With Breast and Prostate Cancer in the United States: An Analysis of Racial Disparities in Access and Quality.', 'Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy and High-Dose-Rate Brachytherapy Boost in Combination With Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy for Localized Prostate Cancer: A Single-Institution Propensity Score Matched Analysis.', 'Stereotactic body radiotherapy versus conventional/moderate fractionated radiation therapy with androgen deprivation therapy for unfavorable risk prostate cancer.', 'The need for androgen deprivation therapy in patients with intermediate-risk prostate cancer treated with dose-escalated external beam radiation therapy.', 'Do African American men have lower survival from prostate cancer compared with White men?

Patients and methods:   We prospectively obtained 2-years longitudinal Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC) and Sexual Health Inventory for Men (SHIM) score data from 99 patients. We classified the frequency of sexual intercourse and sexual activity as 'none', 'less than once a week', 'about once a week', 'several times a week', and 'daily'.  Results:   The percentages of patients who took part in sexual activity before and at 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, and 24 months after NS RARP were 55.6%, 27.9%, 38.8%, 42.5%, 44.4%, 41.7%, and 42.1%, respectively. The percentages of patients who took part in sexual intercourse before and at 3, 6, 9, and 12, 18, and 24 months after NS RARP were 41.4%, 9.0%, 13.3%, 16.3%, 16.7%, 22.2%, and 23.7%, respectively. Preoperative sexual status was classified into two groups: those who had sexual intercourse or those who only had sexual activity except sexual intercourse. Sexual function (SF) was investigated longitudinally using the EPIC and SHIM data between the two groups. The SHIM data showed an improvement in SF in the sexual intercourse group, but did not do so in the sexual activity except sexual intercourse group. On the other hand, SF in the EPIC data might reflect the postoperative improvement of SF in the sexual activity except sexual intercourse group.  Conclusion:   There was a large discrepancy between the percentages of patients taking part in sexual intercourse and sexual activity; therefore, surveys of postoperative SF are recommended to include not only sexual intercourse but also sexual activity.""","""['Shogo Inoue', 'Testutaro Hayashi', 'Jun Teishima', 'Akio Matsubara']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""BJU Int""","""['Anatomical grades of nerve sparing: a risk-stratified approach to neural-hammock sparing during robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP).', 'Exploratory Decision-Tree Modeling of Data from the Randomized REACTT Trial of Tadalafil Versus Placebo to Predict Recovery of Erectile Function After Bilateral Nerve-Sparing Radical Prostatectomy.', 'Health-related quality of life after robot-assisted radical prostatectomy compared with laparoscopic radical prostatectomy.', 'Laparoscopic and robotic-assisted versus open radical prostatectomy for the treatment of localised prostate cancer.', 'Current status of various neurovascular bundle-sparing techniques in robot-assisted radical prostatectomy.']"""

However, its targeted gene network and whether expression of intratumor ERα due to androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) may play a role in PCa progression is unknown. In this study, we examined the inhibitory effect of tamoxifen on castration-resistant PCa in vitro and in vivo. We found that tamoxifen is a potent compound that induced a high degree of apoptosis and significantly suppressed growth of xenograft tumors in mice, at a degree comparable to ISA-2011B, an inhibitor of PIP5K1α that acts upstream of PI3K/AKT survival signaling pathway. Moreover, depletion of tumor-associated macrophages using clodronate in combination with tamoxifen increased inhibitory effect of tamoxifen on aggressive prostate tumors. We showed that both tamoxifen and ISA-2011B exert their on-target effects on prostate cancer cells by targeting cyclin D1 and PIP5K1α/AKT network and the interlinked estrogen signaling. Combination treatment using tamoxifen together with ISA-2011B resulted in tumor regression and had superior inhibitory effect compared with that of tamoxifen or ISA-2011B alone. We have identified sets of genes that are specifically targeted by tamoxifen, ISA-2011B or combination of both agents by RNA-seq. We discovered that alterations in unique gene signatures, in particular estrogen-related marker genes are associated with poor patient disease-free survival. We further showed that ERα interacted with PIP5K1α through formation of protein complexes in the nucleus, suggesting a functional link. Our finding is the first to suggest a new therapeutic potential to inhibit or utilize the mechanisms related to ERα, PIP5K1α/AKT network, and MMP9/VEGF signaling axis, providing a strategy to treat castration-resistant ER-positive subtype of prostate cancer tumors with metastatic potential.""","""['Julius Semenas', 'Tianyan Wang', 'Azharuddin Sajid Syed Khaja', 'Akm Firoj Mahmud', 'Athanasios Simoulis', 'Thomas Grundström', 'Maria Fällman', 'Jenny L Persson']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Mol Oncol""","""['The role of PIP5K1α/pAKT and targeted inhibition of growth of subtypes of breast cancer using PIP5K1α inhibitor.', 'The role of PI3K/AKT-related PIP5K1α and the discovery of its selective inhibitor for treatment of advanced prostate cancer.', 'The functional interlink between AR and MMP9/VEGF signaling axis is mediated through PIP5K1α/pAKT in prostate cancer.', 'Targeting the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Role of PI3K-AKT-mTOR Pathway as a Pro-Survival Signaling and Resistance-Mediating Mechanism to Therapy of Prostate Cancer.', 'The Role of ERα and ERβ in Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer and Current Therapeutic Approaches.', 'Estrogen receptors regulate galectin‑3 in androgen‑independent DU‑145 prostate cancer cells.', 'Molecular regulation of prostate cancer by Galectin-3 and estrogen receptor.', 'MIR497HG-Derived miR-195 and miR-497 Mediate Tamoxifen Resistance via PI3K/AKT Signaling in Breast Cancer.', 'PIP kinases: A versatile family that demands further therapeutic attention.']"""

Sexual challenges are the most frequently occurring issues and can result in increased psychological morbidity. It is recognized that barriers to communication can make initiating discussions around sexual concerns in routine practice difficult. Health care professionals need to routinely initiate conversations, effectively engage with patients, and assess needs in order to provide essential support. One proposed method that could support health care professionals to do this involves the use of prompts or structured frameworks to guide conversations.  Objective:   This study aimed to assess feasibility, acceptability, and satisfaction with the tablet-based Engagement, Assessment, Support, and Sign-posting (EASSi) tool designed to facilitate and structure sexual well-being discussions in routine prostate cancer care.  Methods:   Health care professionals (n=8) used the EASSi tool during 89 posttreatment appointments. Quantitative data were recorded based on program usage and surveys completed by health care professionals and patients. Qualitative data exploring perceptions on use of the tool were gathered using semistructured interviews with all health care professionals (n=8) and a sample of patients (n=10).  Results:   Surveys were completed by health care professionals immediately following each appointment (n=89, 100%). Postal surveys were returned by 59 patients (66%). Health care professionals and patients reported that the tool helped facilitate discussions (81/89, 91% and 50/59, 85%, respectively) and that information provided was relevant (82/89, 92% and 50/59, 85%, respectively). The mean conversation duration was 6.01 minutes (SD 2.91). Qualitative synthesis identified the tool's ability to initiate and structure discussions, improve the ""depth"" of conversations, and normalize sexual concerns.  Conclusions:   The EASSi tool was appropriate and acceptable for use in practice and provided a flexible approach to facilitate routine brief conversations and deliver essential sexual well-being support.

However, despite the plethora of reported nanoscale drug delivery systems that can successfully eradicate solid tumor xenografts in vivo, many of these formulations have not yet achieved clinical translation. This issue particularly pertains to the delivery of small interfering RNA (siRNA), a highly attractive tool for selective gene targeting. One of the likely reasons behind the lack of translation is that current in vivo models fail to recapitulate critical elements of clinical solid tumors that may influence drug response, such as cellular heterogeneity in the tumor microenvironment. This study incorporates a more clinically relevant model for assessing siRNA delivery systems; ex vivo culture of prostate cancer harvested from patients who have undergone radical prostatectomy, denoted patient-derived explants (PDE). The model retains native human tissue architecture, microenvironment, and cell signaling pathways.

Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the outer surface protein of the cell membrane that is abundantly distributed in the heart, lungs, and kidneys and plays an important role in molecular docking of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. In this study, we aimed to analyze the difference in the survival rate according to ACE2 expressions in pan-cancer.

Results:   In the Kaplan-Meier curve, clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), uveal melanoma, and prostate adenocarcinoma showed statistical significance. In the Cox regression, thyroid carcinoma and glioblastoma multiforme and ccRCC showed significant results. Only ccRCC had statistical significance, and high ACE2 expression is related to good prognosis. It is known that the ACE inhibitor, a primary antihypertensive agent, increases ACE2 expression.

However, limited efforts have been directed towards relevant research in the prostate cancer area.  Methods:   A PubMed search was conducted to acquire components of the mRNA m6A machinery. Multiomics integration was performed to systematically investigate the mRNA m6A machinery in primary prostate cancer. Furthermore, RNA interference assays of two prognostic m6A readers EIF3D and HNRNPA2B1 were conducted to explore m6A dependence of their functions in prostate cancer cell proliferation and migration.  Results:   A total of 41 mRNA m6A regulators have been identified to date. A small degree of copy number aberrations and an extremely low frequency of somatic mutations were observed in the regulators across prostate tumors. Enrichment of CpG sites and extensive changes of DNA methylation in the m6A machinery were also found. Impact of copy number variation on m6A regulator expression was stronger than that of DNA methylation disturbance. Furthermore, our study identified a set of m6A regulators related to clinical features and/or survival which were largely m6A-binding proteins. The translation initiation factor subunit EIF3D and the splicing factor HNRNPA2B1 can be independent prognostic factors which may contribute to retardation and promotion of cancer progression, respectively, through affecting cancer-related processes such as cell cycle.

Although 18F-PSMA-11 has already been evaluated in a Phase I and Phase II clinical trial, preclinical evaluation of this radiotracer is important for further understanding its dynamic behavior. Saturation binding experiments were conducted by incubation of LNCaP cells with 18F-PSMA-11 or 68Ga-PSMA-11 for 1 h, followed by determination of the specific and aspecific binding. Mice bearing LNCaP or PC-3 xenografts each received ± 3.7 MBq 18F-PSMA-11 and 68Ga-PSMA-11 followed by dynamic acquisition of 2.5 h as well as ± 15 MBq 18F-FDG followed by static acquisition at 1 h post injection (p.i.). Uptake was evaluated by comparison of uptake parameters (SUVmean, SUVmax, TBRmean and TBRmax). Mice underwent ex vivo biodistribution where 18F-PSMA-11 activity was measures in excretory organs (kidneys, bladder and liver) as well as bone fragments (femur, humerus, sternum and skull) to evaluate bone uptake. The dissociation constant (Kd) of 18F-PSMA-11 and 68Ga-PSMA-11 was 2.95 ± 0.87 nM and 0.49 ± 0.20 nM, respectively. Uptake parameters were significantly higher in LNCaP compared to PC-3 xenografts for both 18F-PSMA-11 and 68Ga-PSMA-11, while no difference was found for 18F-FDG uptake (except for SUVmax). Tumor uptake of 18F-PSMA-11 showed a similar trend over time as 68Ga-PSMA-11, although all uptake parameter curves of the latter were considerably lower. When comparing early (60 min p.i.) to delayed (150 min p.i.) imaging for both radiotracers individually, TBRmean and TBRmax were significantly higher at the later timepoint, as well as the SUVmax of 68Ga-PSMA-11. The highest %ID/g was determined in the kidneys (94.0 ± 13.6%ID/g 1 h p.i.) and the bladder (6.48 ± 2.18%ID/g 1 h p.i.). No significant increase in bone uptake was seen between 1 and 2 h p.i. Both radiotracers showed high affinity for the PSMA receptor. Over time, all uptake parameters were higher for 18F-PSMA-11 compared to 68Ga-PSMA-11. Delayed imaging with the latter may improve tumor visualization, while no additional benefits could be found for late 18F-PSMA-11 imaging. Ex vivo biodistribution demonstrated fast renal clearance of 18F-PSMA-11 as well as no significant increase in bone uptake.""","""['Sarah Piron', 'Jeroen Verhoeven', 'Benedicte Descamps', 'Ken Kersemans', 'Kathia De Man', 'Nick Van Laeken', 'Leen Pieters', 'Anne Vral', 'Christian Vanhove', 'Filip De Vos']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Sci Rep""","""['More advantages in detecting bone and soft tissue metastases from prostate cancer using 18F-PSMA PET/CT.', 'Synthesis and Preclinical Characterization of the PSMA-Targeted Hybrid Tracer PSMA-I&F for Nuclear and Fluorescence Imaging of Prostate Cancer.', 'In Vitro and In Vivo Characterization of an 18F-AlF-Labeled PSMA Ligand for Imaging of PSMA-Expressing Xenografts.', 'Synthesis and pre-clinical evaluation of a new class of high-affinity 18F-labeled PSMA ligands for detection of prostate cancer by PET imaging.', 'Preclinical Evaluation and Pilot Clinical Study of Al18F-PSMA-BCH for Prostate Cancer PET Imaging.', 'Preclinical evaluation and first in human study of Al18F radiolabeled ODAP-urea-based PSMA targeting ligand for PET imaging of prostate cancer.', 'Preclinical comparative study of 18FAlF-PSMA-11 and 18FPSMA-1007 in varying PSMA expressing tumors.', 'Detection rate of fluorine-18 prostate-specific membrane antigen-1007 PET/CT for prostate cancer in primary staging and biochemical recurrence with different serum PSA levels: A systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'An Albumin-Binding PSMA Ligand with Higher Tumor Accumulation for PET Imaging of Prostate Cancer.', 'Comparison of 18FPSMA-1007 with 68GaGa-PSMA-11 PET/CT in Restaging of Prostate Cancer Patients with PSA Relapse.']"""

The anti-cancer actions of HEXIM1 in melanomas and AML have been reported by other groups. Previous studies have shown that 5-Aza-2'deoxycytidine (5-AzadC), a DNMT1 inhibitor, induces re-expression of tumor suppressor genes by removing/erasing methylation marks from their promoters. Our studies highlighted another mechanism wherein 5-AzadC induced DNA damage, which then resulted in enhanced occupancy of NF-ĸB, P-TEFb, and serine 2 phosphorylated RNA Polymerase II on the HEXIM1 gene. As a consequence, 5-AzadC induced HEXIM1 expression in prostate cancer cell lines and triple negative breast cancers. 5-AzadC-induced DNA damage enhanced P-TEFb occupancy via a mechanism that involved activation of ATR and ATM and induction of NF-ĸB recruitment to the HEXIM1 promoter. Downregulation of NF-ĸB attenuated 5-AzadC-induced HEXIM1 expression in prostate and breast cancer cells. The functional relevance of 5-AzadC-induced HEXIM1 expression is revealed by studies showing the HEXIM1 is required for the induction of apoptosis.

Objective:   We aimed to investigate the association between SINS and clinical outcomes after surgery for MSCC in patients with prostate cancer.  Summary of background data:   The SINS is a useful tool for assessing tumor-related spinal instability, but its prognostic value regarding survival and neurological outcome is still controversial.  Methods:   We analyzed 110 consecutive patients with prostate cancer who underwent surgery for MSCC. The patients were categorized according to their SINS. Patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC, n = 84) and those with hormone-naïve disease (n = 26) were analyzed separately.  Results:   In total, 106 of 110 patients met the SINS criteria for potential instability or instability (scores 7-18). The median SINS was 10 (range 6-15) for patients with CRPC and 9 (7-16) for hormone-naïve patients. In the CRPC group, the SINS was classified as stable (score 0-6) in 4 patients, as potentially unstable (score 7-12) in 70 patients, and as unstable (score 13-18) in 10 patients. In the hormone-naïve group, 22 patients met the SINS criteria for potential instability and 4 patients for instability. There was no statistically significant difference in the overall risk for death between the SINS potentially unstable and unstable categories (adjusted hazard ratio 1.3, P = 0.4), or in the risk of loss of ambulation 1 month after surgery (adjusted odds ratio 1.4, P = 0.6).  Conclusion:   The SINS is helpful in assessing spinal instability when selecting patients for surgery, but it does not predict survival or neurological outcomes. Patients with a potential spinal instability benefit equally from surgery for MSCC as do patients with spinal instability.Level of Evidence: 3.""","""['Johan Wänman', 'Johannes Jernberg', 'Patrik Gustafsson', 'Kasim Abul-Kasim', 'Pawel Grabowski', 'Lukas Bobinski', 'Sead Crnalic']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Spine (Phila Pa 1976)""","""['Predicting survival for surgery of metastatic spinal cord compression in prostate cancer: a new score.', 'Patient-reported outcomes after surgical stabilization of spinal tumors: symptom-based validation of the Spinal Instability Neoplastic Score (SINS) and surgery.', 'An analysis of tumor-related potential spinal column instability (Spine Instability Neoplastic Scores 7-12) eventually requiring surgery with a 1-year follow-up.', 'The Spinal Instability Neoplastic Score: Impact on Oncologic Decision-Making.', 'Decompression surgery for spinal metastases: a systematic review.', 'Spinal Instability as a Prognostic Factor in Patients With Spinal Metastasis of Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'A Novel Radiographic Pattern Related to Poor Prognosis in Patients with Prostate Cancer with Metastatic Spinal Cord Compression.', 'Palliative radiotherapy of bone metastases in octogenarians: How do the oldest olds respond?

In the e-RARP group, all 143 patients (286 groins) underwent an IH prevention procedure. In the t-RARP group, the first 22 patients (44 groins) did not undergo an IH prevention procedure, whereas 29 patients (37 groins) with patent processus vaginalis (PPV) among the last 93 patients underwent the procedure. The IH prevention procedure during e-RARP included release of the vas deferens from the peritoneum and spermatic cord, and peritoneal dissection of the spermatic cord at the internal inguinal ring. The IH prevention procedure during t-RARP included release of the vas deferens from the peritoneum and spermatic cord, complete circumferential dissection of the peritoneum around the PPV at the level of the internal inguinal ring, and ligation of the PPV with a Hem-o- Loc○R clip.

Overall, in the US, Black patients historically have higher rates of mortality after surgery than White patients. However, it is unknown whether racial disparities in mortality after cancer surgery have changed over time.  Objective:   To examine whether and how disparities in mortality after cancer surgery have changed over 10 years for Black and White patients overall and for 9 specific cancers.  Design, setting, and participants:   In this cross-sectional study, national Medicare data were used to examine the 10-year (January 1, 2007, to November 30, 2016) changes in postoperative mortality rates in Black and White patients. Data analysis was performed from August 6 to December 31, 2019. Participants included fee-for-service beneficiaries enrolled in Medicare Part A who had a major surgical resection for 9 common types of cancer surgery: colorectal, bladder, esophageal, kidney, liver, ovarian, pancreatic, lung, or prostate cancer.  Exposures:   Cancer surgery among Black and White patients.  Main outcomes and measures:   Risk-adjusted 30-day, all-cause, postoperative mortality overall and for 9 specific types of cancer surgery.  Results:   A total of 870 929 cancer operations were performed during the 10-year study period. In the baseline year, a total of 103 446 patients had cancer operations (96 210 White patients and 7236 Black patients). Black patients were slightly younger (mean [SD] age, 73.0 [6.4] vs 74.5 [6.8] years), and there were fewer Black vs White men (3986 [55.1%] vs 55 527 [57.7%]). Overall national mortality rates following cancer surgery were lower for both Black (-0.12%; 95% CI, -0.17% to -0.06% per year) and White (-0.14%; 95% CI, -0.16% to -0.13% per year) patients. These reductions were predominantly attributable to within-hospital mortality improvements (Black patients: 0.10% annually; 95% CI, -0.15% to -0.05%; P < .001; White patients: 0.13%; 95% CI, -0.14% to -0.11%; P < .001) vs between-hospital mortality improvements. Across the 9 different cancer surgery procedures, there was no significant difference in mortality changes between Black and White patients during the period under study (eg, prostate cancer: 0.35; 95% CI, 0.02-0.68; lung cancer: 0.61; 95% CI, -0.21 to 1.44).  Conclusions and relevance:   These findings offer mixed news for policy makers regarding possible reductions in racial disparities following cancer surgery. Although postoperative cancer surgery mortality rates improved for both Black and White patients, there did not appear to be any narrowing of the mortality gap between Black and White patients overall or across individual cancer surgery procedures.""","""['Miranda B Lam', 'Katherine Raphael', 'Winta T Mehtsun', 'Jessica Phelan', 'E John Orav', 'Ashish K Jha', 'Jose F Figueroa']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""JAMA Netw Open""","""['Improving Surgical Cancer Care: A Rising Tide May Lift All Boats, Yet Inequity Persists.', 'Racial Disparities in the Use of Surgical Procedures in the US.', 'Assessment of Racial Disparities in Mortality Rates Among Older Adults Living in US Rural vs Urban Counties From 1968 to 2016.', 'Racial Differences in the Surgical Care of Medicare Beneficiaries With Localized Prostate Cancer.', 'Age-related racial disparities in prostate cancer patients: A systematic review.', 'Gynecologic cancer disparities: a report from the Health Disparities Taskforce of the Society of Gynecologic Oncology.', 'Surgical Care for Racial and Ethnic Minorities and Interventions to Address Inequities: A Narrative Review.', 'Fecal continence outcomes and potential disparities for patients with anorectal malformations treated at referral institutions for pediatric colorectal surgery.', 'Inequities in surgical outcomes by race and sex in the United States: retrospective cohort study.', 'Comparison of Simulated Outcomes of Colorectal Cancer Surgery at the Highest-Performing vs Chosen Local Hospitals.', 'Rural Disparities in Lung Cancer-directed Surgery: A Medicare Cohort Study.']"""

We aimed to assess oncologic outcomes of patients treated with metastasis-directed therapy (MDT) vs. androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) for oligorecurrent PCa.  Methods:   We analyzed data from patients with oligorecurrent PCa treated with ADT (n = 121), salvage lymph node dissection (sLND) (n = 191) or external beam RT (EBRT) (n = 178). Radiological recurrence (RAR) was defined as a positive positron emission tomography imaging after MDT or ADT. Second-line systemic therapies (SST) were defined as any systemic therapy administered for progression. Oncologic outcomes were evaluated separately for patients with node-only or bone metastases. Kaplan-Meier method was used to assess time to RAR, SST, and cancer-specific mortality (CSM). Predictors of RAR, SST, and castration-resistant PCa (CRPCa) were assessed with Cox regression analyses.  Results:   Overall, 74 (22.6%), 63 (19.2%), and 191 (58.2%) patients were treated with ADT, EBRT, and sLND for lymph node-only recurrence. Both sLND (HR 0.56, 95% CI 0.33-0.94) and EBRT (HR 0.46, 95% CI 0.25-0.85) were associated with better RAR than ADT. Similarly, sLND (HR 0.25, 95% CI 0.13-0.50) and EBRT (HR 0.41, 95% CI 0.19-0.87) were associated with longer SST, as compared with ADT. Similar results were found for CRPCa status. Oncologic outcomes were similar between sLND and EBRT. MDT was not associated with survival benefit in patients with bone metastases as compared with ADT.  Conclusions:   sLND and EBRT were associated with better RAR, SST, and CRPCa-free survival as compared with ADT in patients with oligometastatic PCa nodal recurrence.

Blood-based molecular assays that could be used in adjunct with mammography for increased specificity and sensitivity could have profound clinical impact. Our objective was to discover and independently verify a panel of candidate blood-based biomarkers that could identify the earliest stages of breast cancer and complement current mammographic screening approaches.  Methods:   We used affinity hydrogel nanoparticles coupled with LC-MS/MS analysis to enrich and analyze low-abundance proteins in serum samples from 20 patients with invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) breast cancer and 20 female control individuals with positive mammograms and benign pathology at biopsy. We compared these results to those obtained from five cohorts of individuals diagnosed with cancer in organs other than breast (ovarian, lung, prostate, and colon cancer, as well as melanoma) to establish IDC-specific protein signatures. Twenty-four IDC candidate biomarkers were then verified by multiple reaction monitoring (LC-MRM) in an independent validation cohort of 60 serum samples specifically including earliest-stage breast cancer and benign controls (19 early-stage (T1a) IDC and 41 controls).  Results:   In our discovery set, 56 proteins were increased in the serum samples from IDC patients, and 32 of these proteins were specific to IDC. Verification of a subset of these proteins in an independent cohort of early-stage T1a breast cancer yielded a panel of 4 proteins, ITGA2B (integrin subunit alpha IIb), FLNA (Filamin A), RAP1A (Ras-associated protein-1A), and TLN-1 (Talin-1), which classified breast cancer patients with 100% sensitivity and 85% specificity (AUC of 0.93).  Conclusions:   Using a nanoparticle-based protein enrichment technology, we identified and verified a highly specific and sensitive protein signature indicative of early-stage breast cancer with no false positives when assessing benign and inflammatory controls. These markers have been previously reported in cell-ECM interaction and tumor microenvironment biology. Further studies with larger cohorts are needed to evaluate whether this biomarker panel improves the positive predictive value of mammography for breast cancer detection.""","""['Claudia Fredolini', 'Khyatiben V Pathak', 'Luisa Paris', 'Kristina M Chapple', 'Kristine A Tsantilas', 'Matthew Rosenow', 'Tony J Tegeler', 'Krystine Garcia-Mansfield', 'Davide Tamburro', 'Weidong Zhou', 'Paul Russo', 'Samuele Massarut', 'Francesco Facchiano', 'Claudio Belluco', 'Ruggero De Maria', 'Enrico Garaci', 'Lance Liotta', 'Emanuel F Petricoin', 'Patrick Pirrotte']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Breast Cancer Res""","""['Proteomics-Based Identification of Dysregulated Proteins and Biomarker Discovery in Invasive Ductal Carcinoma, the Most Common Breast Cancer Subtype.', 'Proteomic Profiling of Invasive Ductal Carcinoma (IDC) using Magnetic Beads-based Serum Fractionation and MALDI-TOF MS.', 'Candidate early detection protein biomarkers for ER+/PR+ invasive ductal breast carcinoma identified using pre-clinical plasma from the WHI observational study.', 'Identification and validation of new autoantibodies for the diagnosis of DCIS and node negative early-stage breast cancers.', 'Supplemental Screening for Breast Cancer in Women With Dense Breasts: A Systematic Review for the U.S. Preventive Service Task Force Internet.', 'Proteomics-Based Identification of Dysregulated Proteins and Biomarker Discovery in Invasive Ductal Carcinoma, the Most Common Breast Cancer Subtype.', 'Isolation and identification of extracellular matrix proteins from oil-based CASPERized mouse brains for matrisomal analysis.', 'Green Hydrogel Synthesis: Emphasis on Proteomics and Polymer Particle-Protein Interaction.', 'Discovering biomarkers for hormone-dependent tumors: in silico study on signaling pathways implicated in cell cycle and cytoskeleton regulation.', 'Combinatorial Power of cfDNA, CTCs and EVs in Oncology.']"""

Results: Patients in the RP and XRT groups were found to be older than the RC group (p = 0.0108) and also have a greater Charlson comorbidity index (p < 0.001). There was no difference in estimated blood loss, operative time, and length of stay across all three groups. The RP group had a higher rate of positive margins 31.58% compared with RC and XRT at 8.22% and 10.00%, respectively (p = 0.0036).

The current standard needle positioning approach is based on human intuition, which cannot guarantee a high-quality plan. This study proposed a method to simultaneously select needle catheter positions and determine dwell time for preplanning of HDR brachytherapy of prostate cancer.  Methods:   We formulated the needle catheter selection problem and inverse dwell time optimization problem in a unified framework. In addition to the dose objectives of the planning target volume (PTV) and organs at risk (OARs), the objective function incorporated a group-sparsity term with a needle-specific adaptive weighting scheme to generate high-quality plans with the minimal number of needle catheters. The optimization problem was solved by a fast-iterative shrinkage-thresholding algorithm. For validation purposes, we tested the proposed algorithm on 10 patient cases previously treated at our institution and compared the resulting plans with plans generated using needle catheters selected manually.  Results:   Compared to the plan with manually selected needle catheters, when normalizing both plans to the same PTV coverage V 100% = 95%, the plans generated by the proposed algorithm reduced median V 125% from 65% to 64%, but increased median V 150% from 35% to 38%, and V 200% from 14% to 16%. All planning objectives were met. All clinically important dosimetric parameters of OARs were reduced. D 1cc of bladder and rectum were reduced from 8.57 Gy to 8.50 Gy and from 7.24 Gy to 6.80 Gy, respectively. D max of urethra was reduced from 15.85 Gy to 15.77 Gy. The median number of selected needle catheters was reduced by two. The computational time for solving the proposed optimization problem was ∼90 s using MATLAB.  Conclusion:   The proposed algorithm was able to generate plans for prostate cancer HDR brachytherapy preplanning with increased median conformity index (0.73-0.77) and slightly lower median homogeneity index (0.64-0.62) with the number of selected needles reduced by two compared to the manual needle selection approach.""","""['Chao Wang', 'Yesenia Gonzalez', 'Chenyang Shen', 'Brian Hrycushko', 'Xun Jia']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Phys Med Biol""","""['A fast inverse treatment planning strategy facilitating optimized catheter selection in image-guided high-dose-rate interstitial gynecologic brachytherapy.', 'Investigating the role of constrained CVT and CVT in HIPO inverse planning for HDR brachytherapy of prostate cancer.', 'Adaptation of the CVT algorithm for catheter optimization in high dose rate brachytherapy.', 'Use of three-dimensional radiation therapy planning tools and intraoperative ultrasound to evaluate high dose rate prostate brachytherapy implants.', 'Emerging technologies in brachytherapy.']"""

The phantom applied internal lateral rotation (up to 25°) and coupled vertical and longitudinal translation of a radiochromic film stack that was used for dose measurements. Dose was delivered for each plan while the phantom applied motion according to three typical prostate motion traces without compensation (i), with gating (ii), with MLC tracking (iii) or with couch tracking (iv). Measured doses for the four motion compensation strategies were compared with the planned dose in terms of γ-index analysis, target coverage and organs at risk (OAR) sparing.  Results:   Intrafraction rotation reduced the 3%(global)/2mm γ-index passing rate (γPR) for the prostate target volume by median (range) -33.2% (-68.6%, -4.1%) when no motion compensation was applied. The use of motion compensation improved the γPR by 13.2% (-0.4%, 32.9%) for gating, by 6.0% (-0.8%, 27.7%) for MLC tracking and by 11.1% (1.2%, 22.9%) for couch tracking. The three compensation techniques improved the target coverage in most cases. Gating showed better OAR sparing than MLC tracking or couch tracking.  Conclusions:   Compensation of intrafraction prostate rotation with gating, MLC tracking and couch tracking was investigated experimentally for the first time. All three techniques improved the dosimetric accuracy, but residual motion-related dose errors remained due to the lack of rotation correction.""","""['Robin De Roover', 'Rune Hansen', 'Wouter Crijns', 'Casper Gammelmark Muurholm', 'Kenneth Poels', 'Simon Skouboe', 'Karin Haustermans', 'Per Rugaard Poulsen', 'Tom Depuydt']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Radiother Oncol""","""['Experimental investigation of dynamic real-time rotation-including dose reconstruction during prostate tracking radiotherapy.', 'Potential benefits of dosimetric VMAT tracking verified with 3D film measurements.', 'Validation of dynamic treatment-couch tracking for prostate SBRT.', 'Adaptive optimization by 6 DOF robotic couch in prostate volumetric IMRT treatment: rototranslational shift and dosimetric consequences.', 'A review of artificial intelligence applications for motion tracking in radiotherapy.', 'Experimental investigation of dynamic real-time rotation-including dose reconstruction during prostate tracking radiotherapy.']"""

The following challenges were investigated; T2-SPACE MR sequences, patient data from multiple centres and the impact of sex and cancer site on sCT quality.  Method:   RT treatment position CT and T2-SPACE MR scans, from two centres, were collected for 90 ano-rectal patients. A cGAN model trained using a focal loss function, was trained and tested on 46 and 44 CT-MR ano-rectal datasets, paired using deformable registration, respectively. VMAT plans were created on CT and recalculated on sCT. Dose differences and gamma indices assessed sCT dosimetric accuracy. A linear mixed effect (LME) model assessed the impact of centre, sex and cancer site.  Results:   A mean PTV D95% dose difference of 0.1% (range: -0.5% to 0.7%) was found between CT and sCT. All gamma index (1%/1 mm threshold) measurements were >99.0%. The LME model found the impact of modality, cancer site, sex and centre was clinically insignificant (effect ranges: -0.4% and 0.3%).

Methods:   We retrospectively evaluated multiparametric MRI images of 119 lesions in 111 patients with biopsy-proven clinically significant PCA. Three readers assigned visual grading scores for visibility on each sequence, and a visual grading characteristic analysis was performed. Linear regression was used to explore which factors contributed to visibility in individual sequences.  Results:   The visibility of lesions was significantly better with mpMRI when compared to biparametric MRI in visual grading characteristic (VGC) analysis, with an AUCVGC of 0.62 (95% CI 0.55-0.69; p < 0.001). This benefit was seen across all readers. Multivariable linear regression revealed that a location in the peripheral zone was associated with better visibility on T2-weighted imaging (T2w). A higher Prostate Imaging-Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) score was associated with better visibility on both diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and DCE. Increased lesion size was associated with better visibility on all sequences.  Conclusions:   Visibility of clinically significant PCA is improved by using mpMRI. DCE and DWI images independently improve lesion visibility compared to T2w images alone. Further research into the potential of DCE to impact on clinical decision-making is suggested.  Key points:   • DCE and DWI images independently improve clinically significant prostate cancer lesion visibility compared to T2w images alone. • Multiparametric MRI (DCE, DWI, T2w) achieved significantly higher visibility scores than biparametric MRI (DWI, T2w). • Location in the transition zone is associated with poor visibility on T2w, while it did not affect visibility on DWI or DCE.""","""['Nicolai Alexander Huebner', 'Stephan Korn', 'Irene Resch', 'Bernhard Grubmüller', 'Tobias Gross', 'Robert Gale', 'Gero Kramer', 'Nina Poetsch', 'Paola Clauser', 'Andrea Haitel', 'Harun Fajkovic', 'Shahrokh F Shariat', 'Pascal A Baltzer']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Eur Radiol""","""['A Multireader Exploratory Evaluation of Individual Pulse Sequence Cancer Detection on Prostate Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI).', 'Added value of diffusion-weighted images and dynamic contrast enhancement in multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging for the detection of clinically significant prostate cancer in the PICTURE trial.', 'Multiparametric MRI for Suspected Recurrent Prostate Cancer after HIFU:Is DCE still needed?', 'Prostate imaging reporting and data system version 2 (PI-RADS v2): a pictorial review.', 'Is contrast enhancement needed for diagnostic prostate MRI?', 'Up-to-Date Imaging and Diagnostic Techniques for Prostate Cancer: A Literature Review.', 'mpMRI Interpretation in Active Surveillance for Prostate Cancer-An overview of the PRECISE score.', 'The added value of AI-based computer-aided diagnosis in classification of cancer at prostate MRI.', 'Effects of dynamic contrast enhancement on transition zone prostate cancer in Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System Version 2.1.', 'Diagnostic Accuracy of Abbreviated Bi-Parametric MRI (a-bpMRI) for Prostate Cancer Detection and Screening: A Multi-Reader Study.']"""

Conventional methods for detecting SNPs are typically based on PCR or DNA sequencing, which is time-consuming, costly, and requires complex instrumentation. In this study, we present a duplex probe-directed recombinase amplification (duplex-PDRA) assay that can perform real-time detection of two SNPs (rs6983267 and rs1447295) in four reactions in two tubes at 39°C within 30 min. The sensitivity of duplex-PDRA was 2×103-104 copies per reaction and no cross-reactivity was observed. A total of 382 clinical samples (179 prostate cancer patients and 203 controls) from northern China were collected and tested by duplex-PDRA assay and direct sequencing. The genotyping results were completely identical. In addition, the association analysis of two SNPs with prostate cancer risk and bone metastasis was conducted. We found that the TT genotype of rs6983267 (OR: 0.42; 95%CI: 0.23-0.78; P=0.005) decreased the risk of prostate cancer, while the CA genotype of rs1447295 (OR: 1.89; 95%CI: 1.20-2.96; P=0.005) increased the risk of prostate cancer. However, no association between the two SNPs (rs6983267 and rs1447295) and bone metastasis in prostate cancer was found in this study (P>0.05).

Aim of our study was to evaluate the utilisation of care among patients with post-prostatectomy UI and ED in Germany.  Methods:   The HAROW study documented treatment of patients with localised prostate cancer (≤ T2c) in Germany. 1260 patients underwent radical prostatectomy (RP). Patients answered validated questionnaires after a median follow-up of 6.3 years. Response rate was 76.8%.  Results:   Median age at RP was 65 (IQR 60-69) years. 14% (134/936) used more than one pad per day for UI. 25% (26/104, 30 missing) of UI patients underwent surgery to improve continence. Of patients without surgery, 41% (31/75) reported a moderate-to-severe issue concerning their incontinence with worse mental health and QoL. 81% (755/936) patients were unable to have an erection firm enough for sexual intercourse. Of all ED patients, 40% (319/793) used ED treatment regularly or tried it at least once. 49% (243/499) of patients with interest in sex never tried ED treatment. In multivariate analysis, patients not using ED treatments were older (≥ 70 years OR 4.1), and more often had preoperative ED (OR 2.3) and less interest in sex (OR 2.2). Nevertheless, 30% (73/240) of these patients had moderate-to-severe issues with their ED reporting worse mental health and QoL.

The tissue-necrotizing activity of cobra cytotoxins, nevertheless, indicates anticancer potentials. This study set to explore the anticancer properties of the venoms and cytotoxins from Naja sumatrana (equatorial spitting cobra) and Naja kaouthia (monocled cobra), two highly venomous species in Southeast Asia. The cytotoxicity, selectivity, and cell death mechanisms of their venoms and cytotoxins (NS-CTX from N. sumatrana: NS-CTX; N. kaouthia: NK-CTX) were elucidated in human lung (A549), prostate (PC-3), and breast (MCF-7) cancer cell lines. Cytotoxins were purified through a sequential fractionation approach using cation-exchange chromatography, followed by C18 reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) to homogeneity validated with sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and identified by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LCMS/MS). The cobra venoms and their respective cytotoxins exhibited concentration-dependent growth inhibitory effects in all cell lines tested, with the cytotoxins being more potent compared to the corresponding whole venoms. NS-CTX and NK-CTX are, respectively, P-type and S-type isoforms of cytotoxin, based on the amino acid sequences as per LCMS/MS analysis. Both cytotoxins exhibited differential cytotoxic effects in the cell lines tested, with NS-CTX (P-type cytotoxin) being significantly more potent in inhibiting the growth of the cancer cells. Both cytotoxins demonstrated promising selectivity only for the A549 lung cancer cell line (selectivity index = 2.17 and 2.26, respectively) but not in prostate (PC-3) and breast (MCF-7) cancer cell lines (selectivity index < 1). Flow cytometry revealed that the A549 lung cancer cells treated with NS-CTX and NK-CTX underwent necrosis predominantly. Meanwhile, the cytotoxins induced mainly caspase-independent late apoptosis in the prostate (PC-3) and breast (MCF-7) cancer cells lines but lacked selectivity. The findings revealed the limitations and challenges that could be faced during the development of new cancer therapy from cobra cytotoxins, notwithstanding their potent anticancer effects.

However, little is known about the mechanism of action. Here, we studied the effects of purified fatty acid molecules on prostate tumor progression using the TRAMP-C2 syngeneic immunocompetent mouse model. Compared with ω-6 or ω-9-supplemented animals, we observed that late-stage prostate tumor growth was reduced with a monoacylglyceride (MAG)-conjugated form of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) supplementation, whereas docosahexanenoic acid (DHA) caused an early reduction. MAG-EPA significantly decreased tumor blood vessel diameter (P < 0.001). RNA sequencing analysis revealed that MAG-EPA downregulated angiogenesis- and vascular-related pathways in tumors. We also observed this tissue vascular phenotype in a clinical trial testing MAG-EPA versus a high oleic sunflower oil placebo. Using anti-CD31 IHC, we observed that MAG-EPA reduced blood vessel diameter in prostate tumor tissue (P = 0.03) but not in normal adjacent tissue. Finally, testing autocrine and paracrine effects in an avascular tumor spheroid growth assay, both exogenous MAG-EPA and endogenous ω3 reduced VEGF secretion and in vitro endothelial cell tube formation and blocked tumor spheroid growth, suggesting that ω3 molecules can directly hinder prostate cancer cell growth. Altogether, our results suggest that fatty acids regulate prostate cancer growth and that a tumor-specific microenvironment is required for the anti-vascular effect of MAG-EPA in patients with prostate cancer.

However, whether the associations reflect causality remains debatable. We investigated the potential causal associations of milk consumption with the risk of colorectal, bladder, breast, and prostate cancer using a genetic variant near the LCT gene as proxy for milk consumption.  Methods:   We obtained genetic association estimates for cancer from the UK Biobank (n = 367,643 women and men), FinnGen consortium (n = 135,638 women and men), Breast Cancer Association Consortium (n = 228,951 women), and Prostate Cancer Association Group to Investigate Cancer Associated Alterations in the Genome consortium (n = 140,254 men). Milk consumption was proxied by a genetic variant (rs4988235 or rs182549) upstream of the gene encoding lactase, which catalyzes the breakdown of lactose.  Results:   Genetically proxied milk consumption was associated with a reduced risk of colorectal cancer. The odds ratio (OR) for each additional milk intake increasing allele was 0.95 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.91-0.99; P = 0.009). There was no overall association of genetically predicted milk consumption with bladder (OR 0.99; 95% CI 0.94-1.05; P = 0.836), breast (OR 1.01; 95% CI 1.00-1.02; P = 0.113), and prostate cancer (OR 1.01; 95% CI 0.99-1.02; P = 0.389), but a positive association with prostate cancer was observed in the FinnGen consortium (OR 1.07; 95% CI 1.01-1.13; P = 0.026).

The overexpression of TCTP protein plays an important role in castration resistance. Over the last decade, antisense technology has emerged as a rising strategy in oncology. Using antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) to silence TCTP protein is a promising therapeutic option-however, the pharmacokinetics of ASO does not always meet the requirements of proper delivery to the tumor site. In this context, developing drug delivery systems is an attractive strategy for improving the efficacy of ASO directed against TCTP. The liposome should protect and deliver ASO at the intracellular level in order to be effective. In addition, because prostate cancer cells express Her2, using an anti-Her2 targeting antibody will increase the affinity of the liposome for the cell and optimize the intratumoral penetration of the ASO, thus improving efficacy. Here, we have designed and developed pegylated liposomes and Her2-targeting immunoliposomes. Mean diameter was below 200 nm, thus ensuring proper enhanced permeation and retention (EPR) effect. Encapsulation rate for ASO was about 40%. Using human PC-3 prostate cancer cells as a canonical model, free ASO and ASO encapsulated into either liposomes or anti-Her2 immunoliposomes were tested for efficacy in vitro using 2D and 3D spheroid models. While the encapsulated forms of ASO were always more effective than free ASO, we observed differences in efficacy of encapsulated ASO. For short exposure times (i.e., 4 h) ASO liposomes (ASO-Li) were more effective than ASO-immunoliposomes (ASO-iLi). Conversely, for longer exposure times, ASO-iLi performed better than ASO-Li. This pilot study demonstrates that it is possible to encapsulate ASO into liposomes and to yield antiproliferative efficacy against PCa. Importantly, despite mild Her2 expression in this PC-3 model, using a surface mAb as targeting agent provides further efficacy, especially when exposure is longer. Overall, the development of third-generation ASO-iLi should help to take advantage of the expression of Her2 by prostate cancer cells in order to allow greater specificity of action in vivo and thus a gain in efficacy.""","""['Guillaume Sicard', 'Clément Paris', 'Sarah Giacometti', 'Anne Rodallec', 'Joseph Ciccolini', 'Palma Rocchi', 'Raphaëlle Fanciullino']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Pharmaceutics""","""['Tumor targeting using anti-her2 immunoliposomes.', 'Anti-HER2 immunoliposomes for co-delivery of paclitaxel and rapamycin for breast cancer therapy.', 'Anti-HER2 immunoliposomes: enhanced efficacy attributable to targeted delivery.', 'Antisense oligonucleotides: target validation and development of systemically delivered therapeutic nanoparticles.', 'Targeted delivery system for antisense oligonucleotides: a novel experimental strategy for neuroblastoma treatment.', 'Versatility of Liposomes for Antisense Oligonucleotide Delivery: A Special Focus on Various Therapeutic Areas.', 'DOPE/CHEMS-Based EGFR-Targeted Immunoliposomes for Docetaxel Delivery: Formulation Development, Physicochemical Characterization and Biological Evaluation on Prostate Cancer Cells.', 'Liposomal Delivery of MIW815 (ADU-S100) for Potentiated STING Activation.', 'Nonviral delivery systems for antisense oligonucleotide therapeutics.', 'Optimization of DOTAP/chol Cationic Lipid Nanoparticles for mRNA, pDNA, and Oligonucleotide Delivery.']"""

To identify differences in approach to the management of SD according to disease stage.  Subjects and methods:   A 14-question mixed methods survey was designed to assess the current UK practice. Closed- and open-ended questions were used to quantify results while allowing participants to expand on answers. The survey was distributed to members of the British Uro-Oncology Group at the 2019 annual meeting.  Results:   Surveys were completed by 63 uro-oncologists attending the annual meeting of the British Uro-Oncology Group (response rate 66%). The major issue highlighted was a difference in approach to managing SD according to disease stage. More than half of the participants (56%) said 'advanced stage of disease' was a barrier to discussing SD. Clinicians were less likely to discuss SD, take baseline assessments, refer to a specialist clinic or offer rehabilitation when dealing with patients with advanced disease. Only a minority said that the management of SD was primarily their responsibility (11%). Nearly all clinicians (92%) had access to SD clinics; however, the majority of clinicians did not routinely refer patients.  Conclusions:   This study shows that men with advanced prostate cancer need better support in managing SD. Patients receiving long-term ADT are less likely to be offered any kind of help or intervention.

We hypothesized that a combination of more potent but shorter-term androgen inhibition in men with intermediate- or high-risk localized PC would synergize with definitive RT to provide short-term testosterone recovery and improve disease control.  Methods and materials:   This prospective phase 2 single-arm trial enrolled men with low-volume unfavorable intermediate or high-risk localized PC. Treatment included 6 months of ADT concurrent with abiraterone acetate plus prednisone (AAP) once daily and RT to prostate and seminal vesicles. The primary endpoint was the proportion of men with an undetectable prostate-specific antigen (PSA) at 12-months; secondary objectives included biochemical progression-free survival (PFS), testosterone recovery, toxicity, and sexual and hormonal quality of life.  Results:   We enrolled 37 men between January 2014 and August 2016, 45% of whom were high risk. All patients had T1-2 disease and PSA < 20 ng/mL. Median follow-up is 37 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 35.7-39.1). Treatment noted 32% grade 3 toxicities related to AAP, predominantly hypertension, with no toxicities ≥G4. The rate of undetectable PSA at 12 months was 55% (95% CI, 36%-72%). With 46 months of median follow-up, 2 of 37 patients developed PSA progression (36-month PFS = 96%; 95% CI, 76%-99%), and 81% of patients recovered testosterone with a median time to recovery of 9.2 months. Hormonal or sexual function declined at 6 months with subsequent improvement by 24 months.

However, an estimated 30% of responders will develop resistance to these therapies within 2 years. JNJ-pan-AR is a broad-spectrum AR antagonist that inhibits wild-type AR as well as several mutated versions of AR that have emerged in patients on chronic antiandrogen treatment. In this work, we aimed to identify the potential underlying mechanisms of resistance that may result from chronic JNJ-pan-AR treatment.  Methods:   The LNCaP JNJR prostate cancer subline was developed by chronically exposing LNCaP parental cells to JNJ-pan-AR. Transcriptomic and proteomic profiling was performed to identify potential drivers and/or biomarkers of the resistant phenotype.  Results:   Several enzymes critical to intratumoral androgen biosynthesis, Aldo-keto reductase family 1 member C3 (AKR1C3), UGT2B15, and UGT2B17 were identified as potential upstream regulators of the JNJ-pan-AR resistant cells. While we confirmed the overexpression of all three enzymes in the resistant cells only AKR1C3 expression played a functional role in driving JNJ-pan-AR resistance. We also discovered that AKR1C3 regulates UGT2B15 and UGT2B17 expression in JNJ-pan-AR resistant cells.

However, the identification of prognostic markers able to discriminate which patients could benefit from IKKα inhibitors is urgently required. The present study investigated the prognostic value of IKKα, IKKα phosphorylated at serine 180 (p-IKKα S180) and threonine 23 (p-IKKα T23), and their relationship with the androgen receptor (AR) and Ki67 proliferation index to predict patient outcome.  Methods:   A cohort of 115 patients with hormone-naïve PC (HNPC) and CRPC specimens available were used to assess tumor cell expression of proteins within both the cytoplasm and the nucleus by immunohistochemistry. The expression levels were dichotomized (low vs high) to determine the associations between IKKα, AR, Ki67, and patients'Isurvival. In addition, an analysis was performed to assess potential IKKα associations with clinicopathological and inflammatory features, and potential IKKα correlations with other cancer pathways essential for CRPC growth.  Results:   High levels of cytoplasmic IKKα were associated with a higher cancer-specific survival in HNPC patients with low AR expression (hazards ratio [HR], 0.33; 95% confidence interval [CI] log-rank, 0.11-0.98; P = .04). Furthermore, nuclear IKKα (HR, 2.60; 95% CI, 1.27-5.33; P = .01) and cytoplasmic p-IKKα S180 (HR, 2.10; 95% CI, 1.17-3.76; P = .01) were associated with a lower time to death from recurrence in patients with CRPC. In addition, high IKKα expression was associated with high levels of T-cells (CD3+ P = .01 and CD8+ P = .03) in HNPC; however, under castration conditions, high IKKα expression was associated with high levels of CD68+ macrophages (P = .04), higher Gleason score (P = .01) and more prostate-specific antigen concentration (P = .03). Finally, we identified crosstalk between IKKα and members of the canonical NF-κB pathway in the nucleus of HNPC. Otherwise, IKKα phosphorylated by noncanonical NF-κB and Akt pathways correlated with members of the canonical NF-κB pathway in CRPC.  Conclusion:   The present study reports that patients with CRPC expressing high levels of nuclear IKKα or cytoplasmic p-IKKα S180, which associated with a lower time to death from recurrence, may benefit from IKKα inhibitors.""","""['Melania Montes', 'Lewis MacKenzie', 'Milly J McAllister', 'Antonia Roseweir', 'Pamela McCall', 'Sophia Hatziieremia', 'Mark A Underwood', 'Marie Boyd', 'Andrew Paul', 'Robin Plevin', 'Simon P MacKay', 'Joanne Edwards']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['LncRNA PCAT1 activates AKT and NF-κB signaling in castration-resistant prostate cancer by regulating the PHLPP/FKBP51/IKKα complex.', 'Downregulation of androgen receptors by NaAsO2 via inhibition of AKT-NF-κB and HSP90 in castration resistant prostate cancer.', 'The prognostic significance of combined ERG and androgen receptor expression in patients with prostate cancer managed by androgen deprivation therapy.', 'Androgen receptor-dependent and -independent mechanisms driving prostate cancer progression: Opportunities for therapeutic targeting from multiple angles.', 'Regulation and function of IKK and IKK-related kinases.', 'Patchouli alcohol suppresses castration-resistant prostate cancer progression by inhibiting NF-κB signal pathways.', 'Inhibitory feedback control of NF-κB signalling in health and disease.']"""

However, the optimal dose of escalated RT and ADT is not known. Here we assessed the impact of radiation dose and length of ADT on biochemical recurrence in a multi-institutional cohort stratified by the Cambridge prognostic group (CPG). We hypothesized that radiation dose and length of ADT would impact outcome in similar risk groups of our patients.  Methods:   Two-hundred and forty-four patients were included, 132 from Oslo University Hospital, Department of Oncology and 112 from Johns Hopkins Hospital, Department of Radiation Oncology. Biochemical recurrence was defined as prostate-specific antigen (PSA) nadir +2 ng/mL. Time to recurrence was estimated using Kaplan-Meier analysis and when stratified by CPG the log-rank test was used. Cox regression analysis was performed to identify factors associated with risk of recurrence. Site of recurrence was investigated.  Results:   The median follow-up time was 7.4 years. The vast majority (71%) of patients were classified as high-risk (CPG 4) or very high-risk features (CPG 5). Significantly more PSA recurrences occurred in CPG 5 (41%) compared with CPG 4 (25%) (P = .04) and five-year cumulative recurrence-free survival was lower for CPG 4 and 5 (89% and 68%) compared with CPG 1, 2, and 3 (100%, 100%, and 93%). The recurrence-free survival for CPG 5 was significantly higher for prostate irradiation of 80 Gy as compared with 74 Gy (P = .011). For CPG 4 and 5 no local recurrences were detected in patients receiving 80 Gy. On stepwise Cox regression analysis neither age nor length of ADT were independent prognostic factors for recurrence free survival.

Next-generation sequencing was used to assess pathogenic variants in 14 PrCa-susceptibility genes and 72 validated PrCa-associated SNPs. We constructed a population-standardized PRS and tested its association with PrCa using logistic regression adjusted for age and family history of PrCa.  Results:   The mean age of PrCa cases at diagnosis and age of controls at testing/last clinic visit was 59.5 ± 7.2 and 57.2 ± 13.0 years, respectively.

One hundred fifty-three patients were selected according to the following criteria: (1) biopsy Gleason pattern ≤3+4 with (2) ≤two positive core(s) and (3) ≤50% core involvement, clinical-stage ≤T2a, and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) ≤20 ng/mL. Follow-up included PSA measurement every six months, prostate biopsies at one year and then every 2-3 years, and MRI every year. Intervention was triggered by (1) Gleason score (GS) upgrading, (2) >two positive cores, or (3) PSA doubling-time in <3 years.  Results:   Mean (±standard deviation) follow-up was 36.4 (±31.9) months. Ninety-three (60.8%) and 20 (13.1%) patients received second and third biopsies, respectively. Seventy-two patients (47.1%) discontinued AS for various reasons (59, intervention; 13, follow-up loss). Reasons for intervention consisted of GS upgrading (42.4%), >two positive cores (8.5%), abnormal PSA kinetics (11.9%), and patient preference (37.3%). Notably, 12 (25.5%) patients had pathologic GS ≥4+3 (unfavorable disease) and 3 (6.4%) patients had pathologic stage ≥T3a at radical prostatectomy. Median time to treatment-free survival was 19.5 months. Of the 59 patients who switched to intervention, biochemical recurrence was reported in only one (0.7%) patient.  Conclusions:   AS is an available option for low-risk PCa in carefully selected patients. Further larger prospective studies are needed to determine the optimal criteria for AS, especially in Korean PCa patients.""","""['Sang Hun Song', 'Jung Kwon Kim', 'Hakmin Lee', 'Sangchul Lee', 'Sung Kyu Hong', 'Seok Soo Byun']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Investig Clin Urol""","""['A Decade of Active Surveillance in the PRIAS Study: An Update and Evaluation of the Criteria Used to Recommend a Switch to Active Treatment.', 'Risk-stratification based on magnetic resonance imaging and prostate-specific antigen density may reduce unnecessary follow-up biopsy procedures in men on active surveillance for low-risk prostate cancer.', 'Definitive pathology at radical prostatectomy is commonly favorable in men following initial active surveillance.', 'Management of localised prostate cancer: watchful waiting, surgery or radiation therapy, depending on the natural course, which is often relatively slow.', 'Low-risk Prostate Cancer: Identification, Management, and Outcomes.', 'Polygenic risk score for tumor aggressiveness and early-onset prostate cancer in Asians.', 'Temporal changes of PIRADS scoring by radiologists and correlation to radical prostatectomy pathological outcomes.']"""

Methods:   An expert-devised paper or online questionnaire was completed by members of the British Uro-oncology Group.  Results:   All respondents stated that they would offer patients with newly diagnosed mHSPC docetaxel and androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) if they were sufficiently fit to receive chemotherapy (this was the only option available at the time of the survey); 64% would strongly recommend docetaxel for those with high-volume metastatic disease and 31% for those with low-volume disease. Hypothetically, if both docetaxel and ARTAs were available in the United Kingdom for mHSPC, almost 65% of respondents would recommend an ARTA with ADT to these patients in at least one-half of all cases, with the strongest recommendations to patients with high-risk disease. Imaging for the response was conducted according to suspicion of disease progression, regardless of treatment, with the minority of clinicians recommending routine imaging. If a choice of therapy was available, docetaxel would be more likely to be offered to patients with liver or lung metastases, and ARTAs to patients with bone or lymph node only metastases. Almost all respondents would offer local radiotherapy to the primary tumour in patients with low-volume disease.  Conclusion:   All the UK uro-oncologists surveyed stated that they would offer docetaxel in combination with ADT to all newly diagnosed patients with mHSPC if fit enough for chemotherapy. ARTAs would be offered to many patients if available, especially those with high-risk disease or those unfit to receive chemotherapy.

The present study aims at developing and evaluating a versatile GRPr-based probe for both PET/SPECT imaging as well as intraoperative and therapeutic applications. The influence of the versatile chelator AAZTA5 on the radiometal labelling properties and the in vitro performance of the generated radiotracers were thoroughly investigated. The GRPr-based antagonist D-Phe-Gln-Trp-Ala-Val-Gly-His-Sta-Leu-NH2 was functionalized with the chelator 6-[Bis (carboxymethyl)amino]-1,4-bis (carboyxmethyl)-6-methyl-1,4-diazepane (AAZTA5) through the spacer 4-amino-1-carboxymethyl-piperidine (Pip) to obtain AAZTA5-Pip-D-Phe-Gln-Trp-Ala-Val-Gly-His-Sta-Leu-NH2 (LF1). LF1 was radiolabelled with gallium-68 (PET), indium-111 (SPECT, intraoperative applications) and lutetium-177 (therapy, SPECT). In vitro evaluation included stability studies, determination of lipophilicity, protein-binding studies, determination of Kd and Bmax as well as internalization studies using the epithelial human prostate cancer cell line PC3. In vitro monotherapy as well as combination therapy studies were further performed to assess its applicability as a theranostic compound.  Results:   LF1 was labelled with gallium-68, indium-111 and lutetium-177 within 5 min at room temperature (RT). The apparent molar activities (Am) were ranging between 50 and 60 GBq/μmol for the 68Ga-labelled LF1, 10-20 GBq/μmol for the 111In- and 177Lu-labelled LF1. The radiotracers were stable for a period of 4 h post labeling exhibiting a hydrophilic profile with an average of a LogDoctanol/PBS of - 3, while the bound activity to the human serum protein was approximately 10%. 68/natGa-LF1, 177/natLu-LF1 and 111/natIn-LF1 exhibited high affinity for the PC3 cells, with Kd values of 16.3 ± 2.4 nM, 10.3 ± 2.73 nM and 5.2 ± 1.9 nM, respectively, and the required concentration of the radiotracers to saturate the receptors (Bmax) was between 0.5 and 0.8 nM which corresponds to approximately 4 × 105 receptors per cell. Low specific internalization rate was found in cell culture, while the total specific cell surface bound uptake always exceeded the internalized activity. In vitro therapy studies showed that inhibition of PC3 cells growth is somewhat more efficient when combination of 177Lu-labelled LF1 with rapamycin is applied compared to 177Lu-laballed LF1 alone.  Conclusion:   Encouraged by these promising in vitro data, preclinical evaluation of the LF1 precursor are planned in tumour models in vivo.""","""['Michael Hofstetter', 'Euy Sung Moon', ""Fabio D'Angelo"", 'Lucien Geissbühler', 'Ian Alberts', 'Ali Afshar-Oromieh', 'Frank Rösch', 'Axel Rominger', 'Eleni Gourni']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""EJNMMI Radiopharm Chem""","""['Theranostic Perspectives in Prostate Cancer with the Gastrin-Releasing Peptide Receptor Antagonist NeoBOMB1: Preclinical and First Clinical Results.', 'Influence of a novel, versatile bifunctional chelator on theranostic properties of a minigastrin analogue.', '3-Cyano-4-18Ffluoro-benzoyl-Ala(SO3H)-Ala(SO3H)-Ava-Gln-Trp-Ala-Val-NMeGly-His-Sta-Leu-NH2.', '68Ga-DOTA-4-amino-1-carboxymethyl-piperidine-D-Phe-Gln-Trp-Ala-Val-Gly-His-Sta-Leu-NH2.', 'Approaches to improve metabolic stability of a statine-based GRP receptor antagonist.', '111InIn/177LuLu-AAZTA5-LM4 SST2R-Antagonists in Cancer Theranostics: From Preclinical Testing to First Patient Results.', 'Modern Developments in Bifunctional Chelator Design for Gallium Radiopharmaceuticals.', 'AAZTA-Derived Chelators for the Design of Innovative Radiopharmaceuticals with Theranostic Applications.']"""

Patients and methods:   We have collected the data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results database of nine US cancer registries for UM patients between 1973 and 2015. We calculated the standardised incidence ratios for single primary UM, first primary and second primary UM, and compared the groups for multiple factors.  Results:   A total of 4946 patients were included in the study; 3863 with single primary UM, 646 developed a second primary malignancy following UM, and 437 patients developed second primary UM following a previous primary malignancy. The risk of developing UM increased after leukaemia, melanoma of the skin and prostate. On the other side, the risk of developing melanoma of the skin, thyroid, renal and other eye and orbit malignancies has increased significantly after initial UM. This risk was more evident in the age group between 50 and 70 years old. Cancer-specific survival was significantly higher in UM associated with other malignancies group compared with single primary UM.

This study aimed to evaluate prostate cancer (Pca) detection rates (CDR), pain, and adverse events using a novel, free-hand TPBx technique, based on elastic fusion of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) under local anesthesia.  Materials and methods:   This multicenter retrospective study included all consecutive patients scheduled for a TPBx. All had clinical suspicion of Pca, active surveillance scheduled for a re-biopsy, or suspicion of local recurrence after previous treatment. Bi-parametric or multiparametric MRI was performed in all patients and classified as positive in the case of Prostate Imaging-Reporting and Data System (PIRADS) suspicion ≥3. At least 1 targeted TPBx was realized from each PIRADS ≥3 index lesion. Six to 12 systematic random TPBx were done in patients with negative MRI. All biopsies were performed under local anesthesia in an outpatient clinic with MRI-TRUS fusion and the 3D navigation system Trinity Perine (Koelis, France). Any- and clinically significant Pca (csPca) (ISUP gr. ≥2) was recorded. Biopsy-related pain and adverse events were reported according to a visual analogue score of 0-10.  Results:   In total, 377 patients were included for analyses. The mean age was 67 years (95% Confidence Interval: 66-68) and the median prostate-specific antigen was 7.2 ng/ml (interquartile range [IQR] 4.8-11.0). MRI was negative in 6% and positive in 94%. The median MRI prostate volume was 43 ml (IQR 31-60) and the median MRI index tumor volume was 0.9 ml (IQR 0.5-2.1). The median number of TPBx was 4 (IQR 3-4). The overall detection of any- and csPca was 64% and 52%, respectively. The overall CDR according to PIRADS 3, 4, and 5 was 30%, 70%, and 94%, respectively. In patients with negative MRI, any- and csPca was detected in 23% and 9%, respectively. The median visual analogue score score was 2 (IQR 1-3, range 0-7). Two patients (0.5%) developed postbiopsy infection, of which one developed urosepsis. Treatment requiring haematuria or urinary retention did not occur.

Patients and methods:   Retrospective, observational analysis of patients (N = 222) ascertained sequentially from a single urology practice from January 2015 to June 2018. Men were included if they had localized PCa, a CCP score, and an mpMRI PI-RADS v2 score. Cohort 1 (n = 156): men with newly diagnosed PCa, with or without a previous negative biopsy. Cohort 2 (n = 66): men who initiated active surveillance (AS) without CCP testing, but who received the test during AS. CCP was combined with the UCSF Cancer of the Prostate Risk Assessment (CAPRA) score to produce a clinical cell-cycle risk (CCR) score, which was reported in the context of a validated AS threshold. Spearman's rank correlation test was used to evaluate correlations between variables. Generalized linear models were used to predict binary Gleason score category and medical management selection (AS or curative therapy). Likelihood-ratio tests were used to determine predictor significance in both univariable and multivariable models.  Results:   In the combined cohorts, modest but significant correlations were observed between PI-RADS score and CCP (rs = 0.22, P = 8.1 × 10-4), CAPRA (rs= 0.36, P = 4.8 × 10-8), or CCR (rs = 0.37, P = 2.0 × 10-8), suggesting that much of the prognostic information captured by these measures is independent. When accounting for CAPRA and PI-RADS score, CCP was a significant predictor of higher-grade tumor after radical prostatectomy, with the resected tumor approximately 4 times more likely to harbor Gleason ≥4+3 per 1-unit increase in CCP in Cohort 1 (Odds Ratio [OR], 4.10 [95% confidence interval [CI], 1.46, 14.12], P = 0.006) and in the combined cohorts (OR, 3.72 [95% CI, 1.39, 11.88], P = 0.008). On multivariable analysis, PI-RADS score was not a significant predictor of post-radical prostatectomy Gleason score. Both CCP and CCR were significant and independent predictors of AS versus curative therapy in Cohort 1 on multivariable analysis, with each 1-unit increase in score corresponding to an approximately 2-fold greater likelihood of selecting curative therapy (CCP OR, 2.08 [95% CI, 1.16, 3.94], P = 0.014) (CCR OR, 2.33 [95% CI, 1.48, 3.87], P = 1.5 × 10-4). CCR at or below the AS threshold significantly reduced the probability of selecting curative therapy over AS (OR, 0.28 [95% CI, 0.13, 0.57], P = 4.4 × 10-4), further validating the clinical utility of the AS threshold.  Conclusion:   CCP was a better predictor of both tumor grade and subsequent patient management than was PI-RADS.

As GRS is population standardized, its value can be interpreted as a relative risk to the general population.  Objective:   To compare the performance of GRS with two guideline-recommended inherited risk measures, family history (FH) and rare pathogenic mutations (RPMs), for predicting PCa incidence and mortality.  Design, setting, and participants:   A prospective cohort was derived from the UK Biobank where 208 685 PCa diagnosis-free participants at recruitment were followed via the UK cancer and death registries.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Rate ratios (RRs) of PCa incidence and mortality for FH (positive vs negative), RPMs (carriers vs noncarriers), and GRS (top vs bottom quartile) were measured.  Results and limitations:   After a median follow-up of 9.67 yr, 6890 incident PCa cases (419 died of PCa) were identified. Each of the three measures was significantly associated with PCa incidence in univariate analyses; RR (95 % confidence interval [CI]) values were 1.88 (1.75-2.01) for FH, 2.89 (1.89-4.25) for RPMs, and 1.97(1.87-2.07) for GRS (all p < 0.001). The associations were independent in multivariable analyses. While FH and RPMs identified 11 % of men at higher PCa risk, addition of GRS identified an additional 22 % of men at higher PCa risk, and increases in C-statistic from 0.58 to 0.67 for differentiating incidence (p < 0.001) and from 0.65 to 0.71 for differentiating mortality (p = 0.002). Limitations were a small number of minority patients and short mortality follow-up.  Conclusions:   This population-based prospective study suggests that GRS complements two guideline-recommended inherited risk measures (FH and RPMs) for stratifying the risk of PCa incidence and mortality.  Patient summary:   In a large population-based prostate cancer (PCa) prospective study derived from UK Biobank, genetic risk score (GRS) complements two guideline-recommended inherited risk measures (family history and rare pathogenic mutations) in predicting PCa incidence and mortality.

Methods:   Using a machine learning program, we identified a 25-Gene Panel classifier for distinguishing PCa and benign prostate. A non-invasive test using pre-biopsy urine samples collected without digital rectal examination (DRE) was used to measure gene expression of the panel using cDNA preamplification followed by real-time qRT-PCR. The 25-Gene Panel urine test was validated in independent multi-center retrospective and prospective studies. The diagnostic performance of the test was assessed against the pathological diagnosis from biopsy by discriminant analysis. Uni- and multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to assess its diagnostic improvement over PSA and risk factors. In addition, the 25-Gene Panel urine test was used to identify clinically significant PCa. Furthermore, the 25-Gene Panel urine test was assessed in a subset of patients to examine if cancer was detected after prostatectomy.  Results:   The 25-Gene Panel urine test accurately detected cancer and benign prostate with AUC of 0.946 (95% CI 0.963-0.929) in the retrospective cohort (n = 614), AUC of 0.901 (0.929-0.873) in the prospective cohort (n = 396), and AUC of 0.936 (0.956-0.916) in the large combination cohort (n = 1010). It greatly improved diagnostic accuracy over PSA and risk factors (p < 0.0001). When it was combined with PSA, the AUC increased to 0.961 (0.980-0.942). Importantly, the 25-Gene Panel urine test was able to accurately identify clinically significant and insignificant PCa with AUC of 0.928 (95% CI 0.947-0.909) in the combination cohort (n = 727). In addition, it was able to show the absence of cancer after prostatectomy with high accuracy.  Conclusions:   The 25-Gene Panel urine test is the first highly accurate and non-invasive liquid biopsy method without DRE for PCa diagnosis. In clinical practice, it may be used for identifying patients in need of biopsy for cancer diagnosis and patients with clinically significant cancer for immediate treatment, and potentially assisting cancer treatment follow-up.""","""['Heather Johnson', 'Jinan Guo', 'Xuhui Zhang', 'Heqiu Zhang', 'Athanasios Simoulis', 'Alan H B Wu', 'Taolin Xia', 'Fei Li', 'Wanlong Tan', 'Allan Johnson', 'Nishtman Dizeyi', 'Per-Anders Abrahamsson', 'Lukas Kenner', 'Xiaoyan Feng', 'Chang Zou', 'Kefeng Xiao', 'Jenny L Persson', 'Lingwu Chen']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""BMC Med""","""['Detection of High-grade Prostate Cancer Using a Urinary Molecular Biomarker-Based Risk Score.', 'Urine TMPRSS2:ERG Plus PCA3 for Individualized Prostate Cancer Risk Assessment.', 'A panel of DNA methylation markers for the detection of prostate cancer from FV and DRE urine DNA.', 'Blood-based and urinary prostate cancer biomarkers: a review and comparison of novel biomarkers for detection and treatment decisions.', 'Urinary Prostate Cancer Antigen 3 as a Tumour Marker: Biochemical and Clinical Aspects.', 'Recent Advances in Blood-Based Liquid Biopsy Approaches in Prostate Cancer.', 'K-RAS Associated Gene-Mutation-Based Algorithm for Prediction of Treatment Response of Patients with Subtypes of Breast Cancer and Especially Triple-Negative Cancer.', 'Urine-derived exosomal PSMA is a promising diagnostic biomarker for the detection of prostate cancer on initial biopsy.', 'Gene-Mutation-Based Algorithm for Prediction of Treatment Response in Colorectal Cancer Patients.', 'Non-invasive Urine Test for Molecular Classification of Clinical Significance in Newly Diagnosed Prostate Cancer Patients.']"""

Understanding and improving functional outcomes are critical to optimising survivorship. We quantified physical and mental health-related outcomes in people with versus without cancer, according to cancer type.  Methods:   Questionnaire data from an Australian population-based cohort study (45 and Up Study (n = 267,153)) were linked to cancer registration data to ascertain cancer diagnoses up to enrolment. Modified Poisson regression estimated age- and sex-adjusted prevalence ratios (PRs) for adverse person-centred outcomes-severe physical functional limitations (disability), moderate/high psychological distress and fair/poor quality of life (QoL)-in participants with versus without cancer, for 13 cancer types.  Results:   Compared to participants without cancer (n = 244,000), cancer survivors (n = 22,505) had greater disability (20.6% versus 12.6%, respectively, PR = 1.28, 95%CI = (1.25-1.32)), psychological (22.2% versus 23.5%, 1.05 (1.02-1.08)) and poor/fair QoL (15.2% versus 10.2%; 1.28 (1.24-1.32)).

In developing countries, cancer screening of all at risk is impractical because of healthcare resource limitations. Thus, determining high-risk areas might be an important first screening step. This study explores incidence patterns of potential high-risk clusters of breast and prostate cancers in southern Iran.  Methods:   This cross-sectional study was conducted in the province of Kerman, South Iran. Patient data were aggregated at the county and district levels calculating the incidence rate per 100,000 people both for cancers of the breast and the prostate. We used the natural-break classification with five classes to produce descriptive maps. A spatial clustering analysis (Anselin Local Moran's I) was used to identify potential clusters and outliers in the pattern of these cancers from 2014 to 2017.  Results:   There were 1350 breast cancer patients (including, 42 male cases) and 478 prostate cancer patients in the province of Kerman, Iran during the study period. After 45 years of age, the number of men with diagnosed prostate cancer increased similarly to that of breast cancer for women after 25 years of age. The age-standardised incidence rate of breast cancer for women showed an increase from 29.93 to 32.27 cases per 100,000 people and that of prostate cancer from 13.93 to 15.47 cases per 100,000 during 2014-2017. Cluster analysis at the county level identified high-high clusters of breast cancer in the north-western part of the province for all years studied, but the analysis at the district level showed high-high clusters for only two of the years. With regard to prostate cancer, cluster analysis at the county and district levels identified high-high clusters in this area of the province for two of the study years.  Conclusions:   North-western Kerman had a significantly higher incidence rate of both breast and prostate cancer than the average, which should help in designing tailored screening and surveillance systems.

Methods:   One hundred and twenty patients underwent sRARP by a single surgeon (V.P.) from 2008 to 2018. To assess the trends in the learning experience they were sub-divided in 4 groups of 30 consecutive patients based on date of surgery. The Kaplan-Meier method and regression models were used to identify survival estimations and predictors of potency, continence and biochemical failure (BCF) at 12 months.  Results:   As the learning experience for sRALP increased operative time (OT) was significantly shorter (from 139.5 to 121 minutes) and the amount of nerve-sparing (NS) undertaken increased (from 46% to 80%). While complications rate remained stable, estimated blood loss (EBL) and radiographic anastomotic leaks (RAL) decreased through the groups (from 124 to 69 ml and 40% to 16,7%, respectively). BCF and continence rates at 12 months after sRARP were similar among groups (23-36% and 36,7-50%, respectively) and chance of potency rates tended to increase (from 3.3% to 16-23%) but was not statistically significant. In a multivariate analysis, predictors for BCF were PSM and GS 8-10. Non-radiation primary treatment was the unique predictor of continence at 12 months after sRARP.  Conclusions:   Our data may suggest a decreasing trend in terms of OT and EBL through the sRARP learning curve. While morbidity remained stable through the time, RAL trended towards a decline. A higher degree of NS was observed through the groups and there was a slight correlation trend between surgical expertise and potency recovery.

Data were analyzed according to the postoperative opioid administration in hospital and/or after discharge. Robotic radical prostatectomy was performed using either the standard multi-port Da Vinci Si robotic platform with a transperitoneal approach (MP-RALP) or the novel DaVinci SP® robotic platform (Intuitive Surgical, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA, USA) with an extraperitoneal approach (SP-EPP). Patients undergoing minimally invasive surgery were included in the ""enhanced recovery after surgery"" (ERAS) protocol regardless of the surgery approach.  Results:   During the study period, 210 patients matched the selection criteria.

Glioblastomas are associated with Akt activation due to somatic alterations in PI3 kinase/Akt pathway and/or PTEN tumor suppressor. Sodium meta-arsenite, KML001 is an orally bioavailable, water-soluble, and trivalent arsenical and it shows antitumoral effects in several solid tumor cells via inhibiting oncogenic signaling, including Akt and MAPK. Here, we evaluated the effect of sodium meta-arsenite, KML001, on the growth of human glioblastoma cell lines with different PTEN expression status and Akt activation, including PTEN-deficient cells (U87-MG and U251) and PTEN-positive cells (LN229). The growth-inhibitory effect of KML001 was stronger in U87-MG and U251 cells, which exhibited higher Akt activity than LN229 cells. KML001 deactivated Akt and decreased its protein levels via proteasomal degradation in U87-MG cells. KML001 upregulated mutant PTEN levels via inhibition of its proteasomal degradation. KML001 inhibited cell growth more effectively in active Akt-overexpressing LN229 cells than in mock-expressing LN229 cells. Consistent with these results, KML001 sensitized PTEN-deficient cells more strongly to growth inhibition than it did PTEN-positive cells in prostate and breast cancer cell lines. Finally, we illustrated in vivo anti-tumor effects of KML001 using an intracranial xenograft mouse model.

However, the underlying mechanism for the dysregulated intercellular communication remains unclear. In this study we compared the proteomic profiles of hyperplastic tissue with adjacent normal tissue of BPH and identified Rab27B small GTPase, a key regulator of exocytosis, as a protein that was overexpressed in the epithelium of BPH tissue. Overexpression of Rab27B in prostatic epithelial cells strongly increased the signaling activities of the PI3K/AKT and ERK1/2 pathways, whereas, downregulation of Rab27B expression in the epithelial cells of BPH reduced the signaling activities and decreased cell proliferation. The elevated Rab27B expression caused an overall increase in cell surface presentation of growth factor receptors without affecting their expression. However, the small GTPase also possesses an inhibitory activity against mTORC1 independent of its role in cell surface presentation of growth factor receptors. Our findings demonstrate a pivotal role of the small GTPase in autocrine and paracrine signaling and suggest that its abnormal expression underlies the dysregulated stromal-epithelial interactions in BPH.""","""['Yu Dai', 'Bo Ai', 'Ying Liu', 'Laura E Pascal', 'Zhou Wang', 'Rajiv Dhir', 'Xuegang Sun', 'Yu Jiang']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Int J Biochem Cell Biol""","""['Stromally expressed c-Jun regulates proliferation of prostate epithelial cells.', 'Dickkopf-related protein 3 promotes pathogenic stromal remodeling in benign prostatic hyperplasia and prostate cancer.', 'Interleukin-8 is a paracrine inducer of fibroblast growth factor 2, a stromal and epithelial growth factor in benign prostatic hyperplasia.', 'Chronic inflammation in the pathogenesis of benign prostatic hyperplasia.', 'Androgen receptor roles in the development of benign prostate hyperplasia.']"""

Material and methods:   Retrospective evaluation of 39 patients with URF primarily intervened in three institutions using different surgical approaches. Success was defined as effective fistula closure. Variables evaluated included demographics, previous treatments, surgical approach, ancillary surgeries, complications and HRQoL by using a standardized non-validated specific questionnaire. Median follow-up from surgery to interview was 55 months (interquartile range 49, range 4-112). Factors determinant of success were investigated using logistic regression. Safety of the procedure was evaluated by Clavien-Dindo scale. Deterioration of continence and erectile function and other HRQoL issues were evaluated.  Results:   Prostate cancer treatment was the predominant etiology. The success rate for fistula repair was 89.5%. The surgical approach was not related to failed repair (p=0.35) or complications (p=0.29). Factors associated with failure were complications (p=0.025), radiotherapy (p=0.03), fistula location (p=0.04) and fistula size (p=0.007). Multivariate analysis revealed fistula size was the only independent determinant of failure (OR 6.904, 1.01-47.75). Complications occurred in 46.2% and severe complications in 12.8%. The mortality related to the procedure was 2.6%. Urinary incontinence was present before repair in 26.3% and erectile dysfunction in 89.5%. Fistula repair caused de novo urinary incontinence in 7.9% and deterioration of erectile status in 44.7%. Globally 79% were satisfied after repair and only 7.9% rated HRQoL as unhappy. Trans-sphincteric approach was related to less deterioration of erectile function (p=0.003), and higher perceived satisfaction in QoL (p=0.04).  Conclusions:   The surgical approach elected to correct URF is not determinant of success nor of complications. Fistula size appears as independent determinant for failure.

Among these, [18F, natGa]rhPSMA-7 has recently entered clinical assessment.  Aim:   Since [18F, natGa]rhPSMA-7 is composed of four stereoisomers ([18F, natGa]rhPSMA-7.1, -7.2, -7.3 and -7.4), we initiated a preclinical selection process to identify the isomer with the most favorable pharmacokinetics for further clinical investigation.  Methods:   A synthetic protocol for enantiopure [19F, natGa]rhPSMA-7 isomers has been developed. The comparative evaluation of the four isomers comprised human serum albumin binding, lipophilicity, IC50, internalization and classical biodistribution studies and competition experiments in LNCaP tumor-bearing CB-17 SCID mice. In addition, a radio high-performance liquid chromatography-based method was developed allowing quantitative, intraindividual comparison of [18F, natGa]rhPSMA-7.1 to -7.4 in LNCaP tumor-bearing mice.  Results:   Cell studies revealed high PSMA affinity and internalization for [18/19F, natGa]rhPSMA-7.2, -7.3 and -7.4, whereas [18/19F, natGa]rhPSMA-7.1 showed approximately twofold lower values. Although the biodistribution profile obtained was typical of PSMA inhibitors, it did not allow for selection of a lead candidate for clinical studies. Thus, an intraindividual comparison of all four isomers in LNCaP tumor-bearing mice was carried out by injection of a diastereomeric mixture, followed by analysis of the differential uptake and excretion pattern of each isomer. Based on its high tumor accumulation and low uptake in blood, liver and kidneys, [18F, natGa]rhPSMA-7.3 was identified as the preferred isomer and transferred into clinical studies.  Conclusion:   [18F, natGa]rhPSMA-7.3 has been selected as a lead compound for clinical development of a [18F]rhPSMA-based candidate. The intraindividual differential uptake and excretion analysis in vivo allowed for an accurate comparison and assessment of radiopharmaceuticals.""","""['Alexander Wurzer', 'Mara Parzinger', 'Matthias Konrad', 'Roswitha Beck', 'Thomas Günther', 'Veronika Felber', 'Stefanie Färber', 'Daniel Di Carlo', 'Hans-Jürgen Wester']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""EJNMMI Res""","""['Synthesis and Preclinical Evaluation of 177Lu-Labeled Radiohybrid PSMA Ligands for Endoradiotherapy of Prostate Cancer.', 'Radiohybrid Ligands: A Novel Tracer Concept Exemplified by 18F- or 68Ga-Labeled rhPSMA Inhibitors.', 'Comparative Preclinical Biodistribution, Dosimetry, and Endoradiotherapy in Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer Using 19F/177Lu-rhPSMA-7.3 and 177Lu-PSMA I&T.', 'Automated synthesis of 18FGa-rhPSMA-7/ -7.3: results, quality control and experience from more than 200 routine productions.', 'Matched-Pair Comparison of 68Ga-PSMA-11 and 18F-rhPSMA-7 PET/CT in Patients with Primary and Biochemical Recurrence of Prostate Cancer: Frequency of Non-Tumor-Related Uptake and Tumor Positivity.', 'Flotufolastat F 18: Diagnostic First Approval.', 'Synthesis and preclinical evaluation of novel 99mTc-labeled PSMA ligands for radioguided surgery of prostate cancer.', 'Validation of 18F-rhPSMA-7 and 18F-rhPSMA-7.3 PET Imaging Results with Histopathology from Salvage Surgery in Patients with Biochemical Recurrence of Prostate Cancer.', 'Preclinical biodistribution and dosimetry and human biodistribution comparing 18F-rhPSMA-7 and single isomer 18F-rhPSMA-7.3.', 'Synthesis and Preclinical Evaluation of 177Lu-Labeled Radiohybrid PSMA Ligands for Endoradiotherapy of Prostate Cancer.']"""

Objective:   This study was performed to develop a cancer ontology with terminology containing consumer terms and to analyze social media data to identify health information needs and emotions related to cancer.  Methods:   A cancer ontology was developed using social media data, collected with a crawler, from online communities and blogs between January 1, 2014 and June 30, 2017 in South Korea. The relative frequencies of posts containing ontology concepts were counted and compared by cancer type.  Results:   The ontology had 9 superclasses, 213 class concepts, and 4061 synonyms.

Colon, breast, stomach, cervical, lung, liver, pancreatic, and prostate cancer; brain tumors; and leukemia appeared most in these posts. At the superclass level, risk factor was the most frequent, followed by emotions, symptoms, treatments, and dealing with cancer.  Conclusions:   Information needs and emotions differed according to cancer type.

To address these limitations, we developed a urine-based disposable and switchable electrical sensor that enables reliable and direct identification of miRNAs in patient urine. The proposed sensing platform combining disposable sensor chips composed of a reduced graphene oxide nanosheet and peptide nucleic acid facilitates the label-free detection of urinary miRNAs with high specificity and sensitivity. Using real-time detection of miRNAs in patient urine without pretreatment or signal amplification, this sensor allows rapid, direct detection of target miRNAs in a broad dynamic range with a detection limit down to 10 fM in human urine specimens within 20 min and enables simultaneous quantification of multiple miRNAs.

The mixed-integer algorithm yields a globally optimum solution to the dose volume histogram (DVH) based problem and, unlike other methods, is not susceptible to local minimum trapping. A hybrid linear-quadratic penalty model coupled to a mixed integer programming model was used to optimize treatment plans for 10 prostate cancer patients. Dose distributions for each dwell position were calculated with RapidBrachyMCTPS with type A uncertainties less than 0.2% in voxels within the planning target volume (PTV). The optimization process was divided into two parts. First, the data was preprocessed, in which the problem size was reduced by eliminating voxels that had negligible impact on the solution (e.g. far from the dwell position). Second, the best combination of dwell times to obtain a plan with the highest score was found. The dwell positions and dose volume constraints were used as input to a commercial mixed integer optimizer (Gurobi Optimization, Inc.). A penalty-based criterion was adopted for the scoring. The voxel-reduction technique successfully reduced the problem size by an average of 91%, without loss of quality. The preprocessing of the optimization process required on average 4 s and solving for the global maximum required on average 33 s. The total optimization time averaged 37 s, which is a substantial improvement over the ∼15 min optimization time reported in published literature. The plan quality was evaluated by evaluating dose volume metrics, including PTV D90, rectum and bladder D1cc and urethra D0.1cc.

Systemic therapy mainly includes targeted therapy and immunotherapy which could cause many complications, and will affect the prognosis and quality of life of patients. It is urgent to find new treatments for prostate cancer. Bioinformatics offers hope for us to find reliable therapeutic targets.

Using the selected differentially expressed genes as targets, a gene interference plasmid was designed, and the constructed plasmid was used for targeted gene therapy. There are some problems about gene therapy that need to be solved, such as how to transfer genes to target cells is also an important challenge. Due to their large molecular weight and hydrophilic nature, they cannot enter cells through passive diffusion mechanisms. Here we synthesized a DNA carrier used surface modified iron based nanoparticles, and used it to load plasmid including ShRNA which can inhibit the expression of oncogene SLC4A4 selected by bioinformatics' method. After that we use this iron based nanoparticles/plasmid DNA nanocomposite to treat prostate cancer cells in vitro and in vivo.

Objective:   To inform future PCa patients about the impact of PCa treatment through self-reported PRO data of fellow patients collected outside a clinical trial setting.  Design, setting, and participants:   A cross-sectional survey was conducted among PCa patients currently receiving or having received treatment. The EUPROMS survey contained the EQ-5D-5 L (generic health), the EORTC-QLQ-C30 (cancer-specific quality of life (QoL), and the Expanded Prostate cancer Index Composite short form 26 (EPIC-26; prostate-specific health) questionnaires.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Descriptive statistics were used to assess the demographic and clinical characteristics, and to analyze the PROs of EQ-5D-5L, EORTC-QLQ-C30, and EPIC-26.  Results and limitations:   Between August 21 and November 19, 2019, 2943 men from 24 European countries completed the EUPROMS survey. The median age of the respondents was 71 yr (interquartile range 65-75 yr); 81.9% was living with a spouse. In total, 1937 (65.8%) men underwent a single treatment, and 636 (21.6%), 300 (10.2%), and 70 (2.4%) underwent two, three, and four treatments, respectively. Fatigue scores are highest for men who underwent radiotherapy or chemotherapy. Progression of disease leads to more insomnia. Surgery affects urinary incontinence the most. Self-reported sexual function amounts to 27/100, with the lowest scores being reported for men who underwent surgery and radiotherapy (15/100). Overall, patients who received two or more treatments reported lower scores for all indices.  Conclusions:   The EUPROMS survey provided a cross-sectional picture of the current PCa patient population and their reported QoL. Initial treatment is often followed by subsequent treatments, affecting mainly sexual function, as well as fatigue and insomnia. QoL of men undergoing chemotherapy is worse for almost all domains. These data can inform physicians and patients on the true impact of PCa treatment.

Design:   Cross-sectional study.  Sample and methods:   A total of 308,602 weighted patients with prostate cancer were identified after applying PSM. The datasets for men with prostate cancer were extracted from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) from 2010 to 2015. For cohort formation, 1:1 PSM was applied. Healthcare utilization and expenditures analyzed included emergency room visits, length of stay for hospital inpatients, outpatient visits, office-based visits, and prescriptions. Generalized linear model with gamma distribution and log link was used to determine which covariates are associated with the increase in healthcare expenditures for each healthcare service.  Findings:   The mean expenditures for emergency room visits between men with prostate cancer and mood disorders was $3,092.34, and it was $1,330.64 for patients without mood disorders (p = 0.038). The weighted total expenditures for emergency room visits in prostate cancer patients with mood disorders is 57% higher (p = 0.0109). Moreover, the weighted total expenditures for outpatient visits in prostate cancer patients with mood disorders is 93% higher (p = 0.0001). The potential predictor in total healthcare expenditures is perceived health status (fair/poor) (p = 0.0066).  Conclusions and implications for psychosocial providers or policy:   Individuals with a diagnosis of mood disorders were found to have higher average healthcare expenditures in emergency room visits than those without mood disorders. Therefore, the implications of this study are to inform the patient care team that the assessment and management of mood disorders is a priority.

However, the mechanism of its biological action is unclear.  Methods:   An engineered cell line overexpressing B7-H3 was constructed. Cell apoptosis, growth and proliferation assays in vitro and an animal model in vivo were performed to analyze the role and possible mechanism of B7-H3 in promoting prostate cancer progression.  Results:   Compared with the control cell line (Mock-RM-1), the B7-H3-overexpressing prostate cancer cell line (B7-H3-RM-1) showed no significant growth differences in vitro, whereas the in vivo tumorigenesis rate of B7-H3-RM-1 was significantly higher than that of Mock-RM-1. These results suggest that B7-H3indirectly, rather than directly, promotes prostate cancer progression. Further analysis revealed that significantly higher levels of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) accumulated in vivo in B7-H3-RM-1 tumor-bearing mice than in Mock-RM-1 mice. In vitro and in vivo experiments showed that B7-H3-RM-1 cells significantly antagonized MDSC apoptosis. To further confirm the role of MDSCs in B7-H3-mediated prostate cancer progression, model mice were pretreated with cyclophosphamide before inoculation to clear immune cells and achieve myelo suppression. The results showed no significant differences in tumor growth between the B7-H3-RM-1 group and the Mock-RM-1 group.

However, clarification of their underlying regulatory circuits and mechanisms demands considerable effort.  Methods:   Integrated analyses were performed on genomic, transcriptomic, and clinicopathological profiles of primary prostate cancer and transcription factor-binding profiles, which included estimating transcription factor activity, identifying transcription factors of prognostic values, and discovering cis- and trans-regulations by long noncoding RNAs. Interactions between transcription factors and long noncoding RNAs were validated by RNA immunoprecipitation quantitative PCR. RNA interference assays were performed to explore roles of the selected transcription regulators.  Findings:   Sixteen transcription factors, namely, ETS1, ARID4B, KLF12, GMEB1, HBP1, MXI1, MYC, MAX, PGR, BCL11A, AR, KLF4, SRF, HIF1A, EHF, and ATOH1, were jointly identified as a prognostic signature. Candidate long noncoding RNAs interplaying with the prognostic signature constituent transcription factors were further discovered. Their interactions were randomly checked, and many of them were experimentally proved. Transcription regulation by MYC and its long noncoding RNA partner AL590617.2 was further validated on their candidate targets. Moreover, the regulatory network governed by the transcription factors and their interacting long noncoding RNA partners is illustrated and stored in our LNCTRN database (https://navy.shinyapps.io/lnctrn).  Interpretation:   The prognostic signature constituent transcription factors and their interacting long noncoding RNAs may represent promising biomarkers and/or therapeutic targets for prostate cancer.

We compared outcomes between patients with IRPC treated with ADT and two different doses of RT vs. RT alone.  Methods:   From December 2000 to September 2010, 600 patients with IRPC were randomised to a three-arm trial consisting of 6 months of ADT plus RT 70 Gy (ADT + RT70) vs. ADT plus a DERT of 76 Gy (ADT + DERT76) vs. DERT of 76 Gy alone (DERT76). Primary end-point was biochemical failure (BF), and secondary end-points were overall survival (OS) and toxicity. RT toxicity was assessed by Radiation Therapy Oncology Group/European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer criteria.  Findings:   With a median follow-up of 11.3 years (interquartile range: 10.9-11.7), patients receiving DERT76 alone, compared with patients receiving ADT + RT70 and ADT + DERT76, had higher rates of BF (32%, 18% and 14%, respectively, p < 0.001), higher rates of prostate cancer progression (12%, 4.5% and 3.3%, respectively, p = 0.001) and more deaths due to prostate cancer (6.5%, 3.0% and 1.5%, respectively, p = 0.03) with no significant difference seen between ADT + RT70 and ADT + DERT76. There was no significant difference in OS between the 3 arms. A higher dose of RT (76 Gy) increased late gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity grade ≥ II compared with lower dose (70 Gy) (16% vs 5.3%, p < 0.001) with no statistical difference for late genitourinary toxicity.  Interpretation:   In IRPC, the addition of 6 months of ADT to RT70 or DERT76 significantly improves BF and appears to decrease the risk of death from prostate cancer compared with DERT76 alone with no difference in OS. In the setting of IRPC, ADT plus RT 70 Gy yields effective disease control with a better GI toxicity profile.

TA parameters derived from T2WI and DWI, prostate-specific antigen (PSA), and free PSA (fPSA) were compared between the HGPCa and non-high-grade prostate cancer (NHGPCa) groups using independent Student's t-test and the Mann-Whitney U test. Logistic regression and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analyses were performed to assess the predictive value for HGPCa.  Results:   Univariate analysis showed that PSA and entropy based on apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) map differed significantly between the HGPCa and NHGPCa groups and showed higher diagnostic values for HGPCa (area under the curve (AUC) = 82.0% and 80.0%, respectively). Logistic regression and ROC curve analyses revealed that kurtosis, skewness and entropy derived from ADC maps had diagnostic power to predict HGPCa; when the three texture parameters were combined, the area under the ROC curve reached the maximum (AUC = 84.6%; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.758, 0.935; P = 0.000).

Bone-specific metastatic progression in prostate and breast cancers is a highly observed example of organ-specific metastasis, or organotropism. Though research has delineated the sequential steps of the metastatic cascade, the determinants of bone-specific metastasis have remained elusive for decades. Applying fundamental ecological principles to cancer biology models of metastasis provides novel insights into metastatic organotropism. We use critical concepts from foraging theory and movement ecology to propose that observed bone-specific metastasis is the result of habitat selection by foraging cancer cells. Furthermore, we posit that cancer cells can only perform habitat selection if and when they employ a reversible motile foraging strategy. Only a very small percentage of cells in a primary tumor harbor this ability.

Methods:   From September 18, 2019 to July 15, 2020, robot assisted laparoscopic prostatectomies by 2 surgeons (1 using SP and other Xi) at a single institution were retrospectively reviewed. Symptomatic lymphoceles were diagnosed after the patient represented to the hospital with symptoms attributable to lymphocele and confirmed by abdominal CT scan. Statistical analysis was performed using R Studio (1.2).  Results:   There were 81 prostatectomies performed during the study period. Of these, 50 were Retzius sparing and 31 were standard approach. The 2 groups were similar in age, BMI, grade group, nerves spared, and T stage. Retzius sparing prostatectomies had higher lymph node yield and were more often performed with Xi multiport. Symptomatic lymphoceles were entirely present in the Retzius sparing group, occurring in 18% of cases at a mean time of 34 days after surgery.

However, randomized controlled trials or large-scale observational studies have not compared brachytherapy boost types directly.  Methods and materials:   This observational cohort study used linked national cancer registry data, radiation therapy data, administrative hospital data, and mortality records of 54,642 patients with intermediate-risk, high-risk, and locally advanced prostate cancer in England. The records of 11,676 patients were also linked to results from a national patient survey collected at least 18 months after diagnosis. Competing risk regression analyses were used to compare gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity, genitourinary (GU) toxicity, skeletal-related events (SRE), and prostate cancer-specific mortality (PCSM) at 5 years with adjustment for patient and tumor characteristics. Linear regression was used to compare Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite 26-item version domain scores (scale, 0-100, with higher scores indicating better function).  Results:   Five-year GI toxicity was significantly increased after low-dose-rate brachytherapy boost (LDR-BB) (32.3%) compared with high-dose-rate brachytherapy boost (HDR-BB) (16.7%) or EBRT monotherapy (18.7%). Five-year GU toxicity was significantly increased after both LDR-BB (15.8%) and HDR-BB (16.6%), compared with EBRT monotherapy (10.4%). These toxicity patterns were matched by the mean patient-reported bowel function scores (LDR-BB, 77.3; HDR-BB, 85.8; EBRT monotherapy, 84.4) and the mean patient-reported urinary obstruction/irritation function scores (LDR-BB, 72.2; HDR-BB, 78.9; EBRT monotherapy, 83.8). Five-year incidences of SREs and PCSM were significantly lower after HDR-BB (2.4% and 2.7%, respectively) compared with EBRT monotherapy (2.8% and 3.5%, respectively).

Risk factor-based guidelines and risk model-based strategies are used to identify patients who could benefit from low-dose chest CT (LDCT) screening. Few studies compare guidelines or models within the same cohort. We evaluate lung cancer screening performance of two risk factor-based guidelines (US Preventive Services Task Force 2014 recommendations [USPSTF-2014] and National Comprehensive Cancer Network Group 2 [NCCN-2]) and two risk model-based strategies, Prostate Lung Colorectal and Ovarian Cancer Screening (PLCOm2012) and the Bach model) in the same occupational cohort.  Research question:   Which risk factor-based guideline or model-based strategy is most accurate in detecting lung cancers in a highly exposed occupational cohort?  Study design and methods:   Fire Department of City of New York (FDNY) rescue/recovery workers exposed to the September 11, 2001 attacks underwent LDCT lung cancer screening based on smoking history and age. The USPSTF-2014, NCCN-2, PLCOm2012 model, and Bach model were retrospectively applied to determine how many lung cancers were diagnosed using each approach.  Results:   Among the study population (N = 3,953), 930 underwent a baseline scan that met at least one risk factor or model-based LDCT screening strategy; 73% received annual follow-up scans. Among the 3,953, 63 lung cancers were diagnosed, of which 50 were detected by at least one LDCT screening strategy. The NCCN-2 guideline was the most sensitive (79.4%; 50/63). When compared with NCCN-2, stricter age and smoking criteria reduced sensitivity of the other guidelines/models (USPSTF-2014 [44%], PLCOm2012 [51%], and Bach[46%]). The 13 missed lung cancers were mainly attributable to smoking less and quitting longer than guideline/model eligibility criteria. False-positive rates were similar across all four guidelines/models.  Interpretation:   In this cohort, our findings support expanding eligibility for LDCT lung cancer screening by lowering smoking history from ≥30 to ≥20 pack-years and age from 55 years to 50 years old. Additional studies are needed to determine its generalizability to other occupational/environmental exposed cohorts.""","""['Krystal L Cleven', 'Brandon Vaeth', 'Rachel Zeig-Owens', 'Hilary L Colbeth', 'Nadia Jaber', 'Theresa Schwartz', 'Michael D Weiden', 'Steven B Markowitz', 'Gerard A Silvestri', 'David J Prezant']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Chest""","""['Evaluation of the Benefits and Harms of Lung Cancer Screening With Low-Dose Computed Tomography: A Collaborative Modeling Study for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force Internet.', 'Evaluation of the Benefits and Harms of Lung Cancer Screening With Low-Dose Computed Tomography: Modeling Study for the US Preventive Services Task Force.', 'Estimation of Future Cancer Burden Among Rescue and Recovery Workers Exposed to the World Trade Center Disaster.', 'USPSTF2013 versus PLCOm2012 lung cancer screening eligibility criteria (International Lung Screening Trial): interim analysis of a prospective cohort study.', 'Lung Cancer Screening in Asbestos-Exposed Populations.', 'Twenty-Year Reflection on the Impact of World Trade Center Exposure on Pulmonary Outcomes in Fire Department of the City of New York\xa0(FDNY) Rescue and Recovery Workers.']"""

Associations with other types of cancer may identify shared risk factors but results from earlier studies were inconclusive. The aim of the present study was to explore the association between PC and other primary malignancies for identifying risk factors.  Methods:   A query of the nationwide Netherlands Cancer Registry generated data about patients diagnosed with PC from 1989 to 2018. The occurrence of second primary malignancies was evaluated separately for year 1 and years 2-30. The expected numbers of second primary malignancies were calculated using incidence reference tables, controlling for age, gender and period. Confidence intervals (95 % CI) for the ratio between observed and expected numbers (SIR: standardized incidence ratio) were calculated using Poisson distributions.  Results:   In a total of 2933 patients with PC, 425 consecutive primary malignancies were observed in 376 patients. Concomitant diagnoses in the first year mainly comprised lung (n = 59) and renal cancer (n = 14). Metachronous malignancies beyond the first year were most common for breast (n = 50), colorectal (n = 41), prostate (n = 32), and lung cancer (n = 29). Beyond year 1, the overall risk of second primary cancer in patients with PC was similar to the risk within the general population (n = 256, SIR = 1.12, 95 % CI 0.99-1.27). Increased risks were observed for soft tissue sarcoma (n = 5, SIR = 3.52, 95 % CI 1.14-8.22) and GEPNET (n = 4, SIR = 4.30, 95 % CI 1.17-11.01).

Methods:   A total of 86 PCa patients treated in our hospital were enrolled. The changes in the expression of TGF-β1 were observed in patients with different clinical stages, different Gleason scores and different ages, and with or without bone metastasis. The correlation between blood LMR and clinicopathological features of PCa patients was detected. Moreover, the univariate and multivariate analyses were performed for clinicopathological factors and progression-free survival (PFS) after treatment, respectively.  Results:   In terms of the clinical stage II, III and IV, the number of patients with high TGF-β1 expression was significantly larger than that with low TGF-β1 expression (p<0.05). Among those with Gleason score of 2-4 points, 5-6 points and 7-10 points, the number of patients with high TGF-β1 expression was significantly larger than that with low TGF-β1 expression (p<0.05). Among those aged ≥70 years old and <70 years old, there were more patients with high TGF-β1 expression than those with low TGF-β1 expression, but without significant differences (p>0.05). There were also more patients with high TGF-β1 expression than those with low TGF-β1 expression regardless of the presence or absence of bone metastasis, showing obvious differences (p<0.05). Besides, the association of LMR with depth of tumor infiltration, stage, grade, size and Gleason score was explored, and the results showed that LMR was negatively correlated with the above indexes (p<0.05). The univariate analysis was performed for 6 indexes, and the patients were divided into progression group (n=52) and non-progression group (n=34) based on the presence or absence of cancer progression after treatment. Obvious differences were found in the comparison of Gleason score, lymph node metastasis, TGF-β1 level and clinical stage between the two groups (p<0.05). It was found in the multivariate analysis that TGF-β1, Gleason score, clinical stage and lymph node metastasis were influencing factors for PFS after treatment (p<0.05).  Conclusions:   The TGF-β1 level is positively correlated with the severity, clinical stage and pathological grade of PCa.

Nowadays, the biological function of PCAT1 on the stemness of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is still unclear. Our purpose was to explore the molecular mechanism of PCAT1 and its target protein in advanced NSCLC.  Methods:   The levels of PCAT1 and Fyn-related kinase (FRK) in NSCLC tissues and cell lines were evaluated by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). The log-rank test was applied to evaluate the role of high PCAT1 levels in shortening the overall survival of NSCLC patients. Chi-square test was to assess the relation between PCAT1 expression and clinicopathological features of NSCLC patients. CCK8 assay tested the cell proliferation of NSCLC cells with PCAT1 overexpression. The underlying regulatory mechanism between PCAT1 and Fyn-related kinase (FRK) was predicted by bioinformatics and verified by RNA transfection, qPCR, and western blotting. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay was done to examine the relation between GATA binding protein 6 (GATA6) and the PACT1 gene. Mice xenografts were applied to examine the function of PACT1 on NSCLC development in vivo.  Results:   PCAT1 was aberrantly elevated in tissues from patients with NSCLC. High levels of PCAT1 expression were more likely to present in patients with late-stage, positive CD133, and inferior overall survival. PCAT1 knockdown reduced cell proliferation, stem cell properties (Sox2 and Nanog expression) of H226 and A549 cells in vitro, and repressed tumor development in vivo. Furthermore, FRK in NSCLC cells was downregulated by silencing PCAT1. The tissue level of FRK was positively correlated with PCAT1 expression in patients with NSCLC. Furthermore, GATA6 was found to be promoter of PCAT1 and increased PCAT1 levels in NSCLC cells.

One major proposed mechanism of resistance to SAT involves the emergence of androgen receptor (AR) splice variant-7, AR-V7. Recently, we developed MTX-23 using the principle of proteolysis targeting chimera (PROTAC) to target both AR-V7 and AR-full length (AR-FL). MTX-23 has been designed to simultaneously bind AR's DNA binding domain (DBD) and the Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) E3 ubiquitin ligase. Immunoblots demonstrated that MTX-23's degradation concentration 50% (DC50) for AR-V7 and AR-FL was 0.37 and 2 μmol/L, respectively. Further studies revealed that MTX-23 inhibited prostate cancer cellular proliferation and increased apoptosis only in androgen-responsive prostate cancer cells. The antiproliferative effect of MTX-23 was partially reversed when either AR-V7 or AR-FL was overexpressed and was completely abrogated when both were overexpressed. To assess the potential therapeutic value of MTX-23, we next generated 12 human prostate cancer cell lines that are resistant to the four FDA-approved SAT agents-abiraterone, enzalutamide, apalutamide, and darolutamide. When resistant cells were treated with MTX-23, decreased cellular proliferation and reduced tumor growth were observed both in vitro and in mice. These results collectively suggest that MTX-23 is a novel PROTAC small molecule that may be effective against SAT-resistant CRPC by degrading both AR-V7 and AR-FL.""","""['Geun Taek Lee', 'Naoya Nagaya', 'Jenny Desantis', 'Kiran Madura', 'Hatem E Sabaawy', 'Wun-Jae Kim', 'Roy J Vaz', 'Gabriele Cruciani', 'Isaac Yi Kim']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Mol Cancer Ther""","""['Targeting androgen receptor and the variants by an orally bioavailable Proteolysis Targeting Chimeras compound in castration resistant prostate cancer.', 'De Novo Design of an Androgen Receptor DNA Binding Domain-Targeted peptide PROTAC for Prostate Cancer Therapy.', 'Rapid induction of androgen receptor splice variants by androgen deprivation in prostate cancer.', 'Androgen Receptor Splice Variant, AR-V7, as a Biomarker of Resistance to Androgen Axis-Targeted Therapies in Advanced Prostate Cancer.', 'ARV-7: A biomarker for the treatment of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Emerging Pharmacotherapeutic Strategies to Overcome Undruggable Proteins in Cancer.', 'Rational Chemical Design of Molecular Glue Degraders.', 'PROTACs in the Management of Prostate Cancer.', 'Targeted protein degradation in cancers: Orthodox PROTACs and beyond.', 'The crosstalk between ubiquitination and endocrine therapy.']"""

We previously discovered that cabozantinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, triggers neutrophil-mediated anticancer innate immunity, resulting in tumor regression in an aggressive PTEN/p53-deficient genetically engineered murine model of advanced prostate cancer. Here, we specifically investigated the potential of cabozantinib-induced neutrophil activation and recruitment to enhance delivery of BSA-coated polymeric nanoparticles (BSA-NPs) into murine PTEN/p53-deficient prostate tumors. On the basis of the observation that BSA coating of NPs enhanced association and internalization by activated neutrophils by approximately 6-fold in vitro, relative to uncoated NPs, we systemically injected BSA-coated, dye-loaded NPs into prostate-specific PTEN/p53-deficient mice that were pretreated with cabozantinib. Flow cytometric analysis revealed an approximately 4-fold increase of neutrophil-associated BSA-NPs and an approximately 32-fold increase in mean fluorescent dye uptake following 3 days of cabozantinib/BSA-NP administration, relative to BSA-NP alone. Strikingly, neutrophil depletion with Ly6G antibody abolished dye-loaded BSA-NP accumulation within tumors to baseline levels, demonstrating targeted neutrophil-mediated intratumoral NP delivery. Furthermore, we observed an approximately 13-fold decrease in accumulation of BSA-NPs in the liver, relative to uncoated NPs, post-cabozantinib treatment, suggesting that BSA coating of NPs can significantly enhance cabozantinib-induced, neutrophil-mediated targeted intratumoral drug delivery, while mitigating off-target toxicity.

The primary aim of this study was to estimate the dosimetry of 99mTc-PSMA I&S using a hybrid method (sequential γ-planar imaging and 1 single SPECT/CT) in healthy volunteers. The secondary aim was to depict the tracer biodistribution and tumor-to-background ratios (TBRs) in patients with prostate cancer (PCa). Methods: Dosimetry of 99mTc-PSMA I&S was investigated in 4 healthy volunteers. Whole-body planar imaging was acquired at 1, 2, 3, 6, and 24 h and SPECT/CT at 6 h after tracer injection. Contours of organs were drawn on all acquisitions to determine organ activity at each time point. Absorbed dose was estimated using 2 methods: independent curve-fitting manual method (Levenberg-Marquardt-based algorithm using dose factors from RAdiation Dose Assessment Resource [RADAR] website) and OLINDA/EXM software (version 2.0; HERMES Medical Solutions). Biodistribution of 99mTc-PSMA I&S was assessed in 10 patients with PCa on SPECT/CT images at 6 h. Tumor uptake (SUVmax), and TBR (tumor SUVmax/background organ SUVmean) using muscle (T/M), bladder (T/B), and intestine (T/I) as background organs were determined. Results: The mean injected activity of 99mTc-PSMA I&S was 717 MBq (range: 562-828 MBq). No adverse events related to the injection of 99mTc-PSMA I&S were reported. The average radiation effective dose was 0.0055 mSv/MBq with the RADAR manual method and 0.0052 mSv/MBq with OLINDA/EXM. Total body effective dose ranged between 3.33-4.42 and 3.11-4.23 mSv, respectively. All PCa patients showed high tracer uptake in primary and metastatic lesions with T/M, T/B, and T/I ranging from 5.29-110, 0.11-7.02, and 0.96-16.30, respectively. Conclusion: Effective doses of 99mTc-PSMA I&S were comparable to those known for most of the 99mTc tracers and was lower than for the 68Ga-labeled and 18F-labeled agents. 99mTc-PSMA I&S SPECT/CT showed high TBR in PCa patients.

Here, we compare the frequency of non-tumor-related uptake and tumor positivity with 68Ga-PSMA-11 and 18F-rhPSMA-7 in patients with primary or recurrent prostate cancer. Methods: This retrospective matched-pair comparison matched 160 18F-rhPSMA-7 with 160 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT studies for primary staging (n = 33) and biochemical recurrence (n = 127) according to clinical characteristics. Two nuclear medicine physicians reviewed all scans, first identifying all PET-positive lesions and then differentiating lesions suggestive of prostate cancer from those that were benign, on the basis of known pitfalls and ancillary information from CT. For each region, the SUVmax of the lesion with the highest PSMA ligand uptake was noted. Tumor positivity rates were determined, and SUVmax was compared separately for each tracer. Results:18F-rhPSMA-7 and 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET revealed 566 and 289 PSMA ligand-positive lesions, respectively. Of these, 379 and 100 lesions, equaling 67.0% and 34.6%, respectively, of all PSMA-positive lesions, were considered benign. The distribution of their etiology was similar (42%, 24%, and 25% with 18F-rhPSMA-7 vs. 32%, 24%, and 38% with 68Ga-PSMA-11 for ganglia, bone, and unspecific lymph nodes, respectively). All primary tumors were positive with both agents (n = 33 each), whereas slightly more metastatic lesions were observed with 68Ga-PSMA-11 in both disease stages (113 for 18F-rhPSMA-7 and 124 for 68Ga-PSMA-11). The SUVmax of 18F-rhPSMA-7 and 68Ga-PSMA-11 did not differ (P > 0.05) in local recurrence or primary prostate cancer; however, the tumor-to-bladder ratio was significantly higher with 18F-rhPSMA-7 (4.9 ± 5.3 vs. 2.2 ± 3.7, P = 0.02, for local recurrence; 9.8 ± 9.7 vs. 2.3 ± 2.6, P < 0.001, for primary prostate cancer). Conclusion: The tumor positivity rate was consistently high for 68Ga-PSMA-11 and 18F-rhPSMA-7. Both tracers revealed a considerable number of areas of uptake that were reliably identified as benign by trained physicians making use of corresponding morphologic imaging and known PSMA pitfalls. These were more frequent with 18F-rhPSMA-7. However, the matched-pair comparison could have introduced a source of bias. Adequate reader training can allow physicians to differentiate benign uptake from disease and be able to benefit from the logistical and clinical advantages of 18F-rhPSMA-7.""","""['Markus Kroenke', 'Lilit Mirzoyan', 'Thomas Horn', 'Jan C Peeken', 'Alexander Wurzer', 'Hans-Jürgen Wester', 'Marcus Makowski', 'Wolfgang A Weber', 'Matthias Eiber', 'Isabel Rauscher']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""J Nucl Med""","""['More advantages in detecting bone and soft tissue metastases from prostate cancer using 18F-PSMA PET/CT.', 'Matched-Pair Comparison of 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT and 18F-PSMA-1007 PET/CT: Frequency of Pitfalls and Detection Efficacy in Biochemical Recurrence After Radical Prostatectomy.', '18F-rhPSMA-7 PET for the Detection of Biochemical Recurrence of Prostate Cancer After Radical Prostatectomy.', '68GaGa-PSMA Versus 18FPSMA Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography in the Staging of Primary and Recurrent Prostate Cancer.

Methods: Therapeutic efficacy of PSMA RLT was assessed by tumor volume measurements, time to progression, and survival in C4-2 or C4-2 TP53-/- tumor-bearing nonobese diabetic scid γ-mice. Two days after RLT, the proteome and phosphoproteome were analyzed by mass spectrometry. Results: PSMA RLT significantly improved disease control in a dose-dependent manner. Proteome and phosphoproteome datasets revealed activation of genotoxic stress response pathways, including deregulation of DNA damage/replication stress response, TP53, androgen receptor, phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase/AKT, and MYC signaling. C4-2 TP53-/- tumors were less sensitive to PSMA RLT than were parental counterparts, supporting a role for TP53 in mediating RLT responsiveness.

However, resistance to enzalutamide inevitably develops in these patients, and the underlying mechanisms of this resistance are not fully defined. Here we demonstrate that the kinesin family member 15 (KIF15) contributes to enzalutamide resistance by enhancing the AR signaling in prostate cancer cells. KIF15 directly bound the N-terminus of AR/AR-V7 and prevented AR/AR-V7 proteins from degradation by increasing the protein association of ubiquitin-specific protease 14 (USP14) with AR/AR-V7. In turn, the transcriptionally active AR stimulated KIF15 expression. KIF15 inhibitors alone or in combination with enzalutamide significantly suppressed enzalutamide-resistant prostate cancer cell growth and xenograft progression. These findings highlight a key role of KIF15 in enabling prostate cancer cells to develop therapy resistance to enzalutamide and rationalize KIF15 as a potential therapeutic target.

Methods:   We investigated this in two patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) developed from breast-to-bone metastases, and its functional significance in a breast cancer cell line system. ED03 and EDW01 PDXs were grown subcutaneously in immunocompromised SCID mice through 11 passages and 7 passages, respectively. Tumour tissue was assessed using immunohistochemistry (IHC) for oestrogen receptor (ER)-alpha, E-cadherin, vimentin, Twist1, beta-catenin, P120-RasGAP, CD44, CD24 and Ki67, and RT-qPCR of EMT-related factors (CDH1, VIM, CD44, CD24), integrins beta 1 (ITGB1), alpha 2 (ITGA2) and ILK. Integrin and ILK expression in epidermal growth factor (EGF)-induced EMT of the PMC42-ET breast cancer cell line was assessed by RT-qPCR and Western blotting, as were the effects of their transient knockdown via small interfering RNA +/- EGF. Cell migration, changes in cell morphology and adhesion of siRNA-transfected PMC42-ET cells to various extracellular matrix (ECM) substrates was assessed.  Results:   The ED03 (ER+/PR-/HER2-/lobular) and EDW01 (ER+/PR-/HER2-/ductal) PDXs were both classified as molecular subtype luminal A. ED03 xenografts exhibited mutated E-cadherin with minimal expression, but remained vimentin-negative across all passages. In EDW01, the hypoxic indicator gene CAIX and Twist1 were co-ordinately upregulated at passages 4-5, corresponding with a decrease in E-cadherin. At passages 6-7, VIM was upregulated along with ITGB1 and ITGA2, consistent with an increasing EMT. The ED03 PDX displayed minimal change over passages in mice, for all genes examined.

The tumor has a characteristic bimorphic pattern with areas of poorly differentiated small round cell component and interspersed islands of well differentiated hyaline cartilage. Histological diagnosis of mesenchymal chondrosarcoma is very challenging especially in small biopsies when tumor presents with little cartilaginous component. In such cases, it is very difficult to distinguish mesenchymal chondrosarcoma from other round blue cell tumors like Ewing's sarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, small cell osteosarcoma and desmoplastic round blue cell tumor. Immunohistochemically, mesenchymal chondrosarcoma stains positive for NKX2.2, CD99, S100 and SOX9. This immunoprofile is non-specific and overlaps with other round blue cell tumors. Till recently, there was no reliable immunohistochemical marker to differentiate mesenchymal chondrosarcoma from other round blue cell tumors. NKX3.1, though widely used as a diagnostic biomarker for prostatic adenocarcinoma, has been recently proposed by Yoshida et al. (2020) as a unique marker of mesenchymal chondrosarcoma and EWSR1-NFATC2 sarcoma.  Objective:   The aim of our study was to further explore utility of NKX3.1 as a diagnostic marker of mesenchymal chondrosarcoma.  Material & methods:   We applied NKX3.1 immunohistochemistry to 21 cases of mesenchymal chondrosarcoma and 32 cases of other round blue cell tumors.  Results:   14 out of 21 cases (66.7%) of mesenchymal chondrosarcoma stained positive for NKX3.1 with nuclear expression in small round component. Cartilaginous component was predominantly negative. All other round blue cell tumors showed negative results.

Caring for these patients is complex and may require resources more readily available at high-volume centers.  Objective:   To evaluate the association between radiation facility case volume and overall survival (OS) in men with N1 prostate cancer.  Design, setting, and participants:   This cohort study included 1899 men diagnosed with T1N1M0 to T4N1M0 prostate cancer treated with curative-intent EBRT and ADT between January 2004 and December 2016 at US facilities reporting to the National Cancer Database. Data analysis was performed from March to June 2020.  Exposures:   Treatment at a center with high vs low average cumulative facility volume (ACFV), defined as the total number of prostate radiation cases at an individual patient's treatment facility from 2004 until the year of that patient's diagnosis.  Main outcomes and measures:   OS was assessed between high- vs low-ACFV centers using the Kaplan-Meier method with and without propensity score-based weighted adjustment and multivariable Cox proportional hazards. The nonlinear association between continuous ACFV and OS was examined through a Martingale residual plot, and the optimal ACFV cutoff point that maximized the separation between high vs low ACFV was identified via a bias adjusted log rank test.  Results:   A total of 1899 men met inclusion criteria. The median (interquartile range) age was 66 (60-72) years, 1491 (78.5%) were White individuals, and 1145 (60.3%) were treated at nonacademic centers. The optimal ACFV cutoff point was 66.4 patients treated per year. The median OS for patients treated at high-ACFV vs low-ACFV centers was 111.1 (95% CI, 101.5-127.9) months and 92.3 (95% CI, 87.7-103.9) months, respectively (P = .01). On multivariable analysis, treatment at a low-ACFV center was associated with increased risk of death (HR, 1.22; 95% CI, 1.02-1.46, P = .03) compared with treatment at a high-ACFV center. These results persisted after propensity score-based adjustment.  Conclusions and relevance:   This cohort study found a significant association of facility case volume with long-term outcomes in men with N1 prostate cancer undergoing EBRT with ADT. Specifically, treatment at a facility with high radiation case volume was independently associated with longer OS. Further studies should focus on identifying which factors unique to high-volume centers may be responsible for this benefit.""","""['Sagar A Patel', 'Subir Goyal', 'Yuan Liu', 'Drew Moghanaki', 'Pretesh R Patel', 'Sheela Hanasoge', 'Vishal R Dhere', 'Jay W Shelton', 'Karen D Godette', 'Ashesh B Jani', 'Bruce Hershatter', 'Benjamin W Fischer-Valuck']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""JAMA Netw Open""","""['Overall survival comparison between androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) plus external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) vs ADT plus EBRT with brachytherapy boost in clinically node-positive prostate cancer.', 'The need for androgen deprivation therapy in patients with intermediate-risk prostate cancer treated with dose-escalated external beam radiation therapy.', 'Adjuvant radiation with androgen-deprivation therapy for men with lymph node metastases after radical prostatectomy: identifying men who benefit.', 'Older age predicts decreased metastasis and prostate cancer-specific death for men treated with radiation therapy: meta-analysis of radiation therapy oncology group trials.', 'THE PROSTATE CENTER: MULTIDISCIPLINARITY, ORGANIZATION OF DIAGNOSTIC WORK-UP AND TREATMENT OF PROSTATE CANCER.', 'Comparison of Clinical Outcomes of Radical Prostatectomy versus IMRT with Long-Term Hormone Therapy for Relatively Young Patients with High- to Very High-Risk Localized Prostate Cancer.']"""

Constitutively active shorter variants of AR, lacking the ligand binding domain, are frequently expressed in CRPC and have emerged as a potential mechanism for prostate cancer to escape ADT. ARv7 and ARv567es are 2 of the most commonly detected variants of AR in clinical samples of advanced, metastatic prostate cancer. It is not clear if variants of AR merely act as weaker substitutes for AR or can mediate unique isoform-specific activities different from AR. In this study, we employed LNCaP prostate cancer cell lines with inducible expression of ARv7 or ARv567es to delineate similarities and differences in transcriptomics, metabolomics, and lipidomics resulting from the activation of AR, ARv7, or ARv567es. While the majority of target genes were similarly regulated by the action of all 3 isoforms, we found a clear difference in transcriptomic activities of AR versus the variants, and a few differences between ARv7 and ARv567es. Some of the target gene regulation by AR isoforms was similar in the VCaP background as well. Differences in downstream activities of AR isoforms were also evident from comparison of the metabolome and lipidome in an LNCaP model. Overall our study implies that shorter variants of AR are capable of mediating unique downstream activities different from AR and some of these are isoform specific.""","""['Harika Nagandla', 'Matthew J Robertson', 'Vasanta Putluri', 'Nagireddy Putluri', 'Cristian Coarfa', 'Nancy L Weigel']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Endocrinology""","""['ARv7 Represses Tumor-Suppressor Genes in Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'AR variant ARv567es induces carcinogenesis in a novel transgenic mouse model of prostate cancer.', 'T-LAK cell-originated protein kinase (TOPK) enhances androgen receptor splice variant (ARv7) and drives androgen-independent growth in prostate cancer.', 'Androgen receptors in hormone-dependent and castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Are androgen receptor variants a substitute for the full-length receptor?', 'A compendium of Androgen Receptor Variant 7 target genes and their role in Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Mechanistic Investigation of the Androgen Receptor DNA-Binding Domain and Modulation via Direct Interactions with DNA Abasic Sites: Understanding the Mechanisms Involved in Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Advances in the Current Understanding of the Mechanisms Governing the Acquisition of Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'From Omics to Multi-Omics Approaches for In-Depth Analysis of the Molecular Mechanisms of Prostate Cancer.', 'Cistrome and transcriptome analysis identifies unique androgen receptor (AR) and AR-V7 splice variant chromatin binding and transcriptional activities.']"""

The odds of COVID-19 infections for 13 common cancer types and adverse outcomes were assessed.  Exposures:   The exposure groups were patients diagnosed with a specific cancer, whereas the unexposed groups were patients without the specific cancer.  Main outcomes and measures:   The adjusted odds ratio (aOR) and 95% CI were estimated using the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test for the risk of COVID-19 infection.  Results:   Among the 73.4 million patients included in the analysis (53.6% female), 2 523 920 had at least 1 of the 13 common cancers diagnosed (all cancer diagnosed within or before the last year), and 273 140 had recent cancer (cancer diagnosed within the last year). Among 16 570 patients diagnosed with COVID-19, 1200 had a cancer diagnosis and 690 had a recent cancer diagnosis of at least 1 of the 13 common cancers. Those with recent cancer diagnosis were at significantly increased risk for COVID-19 infection (aOR, 7.14 [95% CI, 6.91-7.39]; P < .001), with the strongest association for recently diagnosed leukemia (aOR, 12.16 [95% CI, 11.03-13.40]; P < .001), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (aOR, 8.54 [95% CI, 7.80-9.36]; P < .001), and lung cancer (aOR, 7.66 [95% CI, 7.07-8.29]; P < .001) and weakest for thyroid cancer (aOR, 3.10 [95% CI, 2.47-3.87]; P < .001).

OPT exhibits strong cytotoxicity toward the human renal clear cell carcinoma 786-O and the murine prostate cancer RM-1 cell lines. The complex could bind to the minor groove of DNA, as well as DNA topoisomerases I and IIα, thereby acting as an inhibitor of topoisomerase I/IIα and causing DNA damage. The damage was evidenced by the enhanced expression of γ-H2AX, Chk1/2 phosphorylation, p53 and cell cycle arrest in the G2/M phase. In contrast, the inhibitory effect of PPT on DNA topoisomerases was largely limited to the isolated enzymes. The results demonstrate that the cellular inhibition of the complex towards the DNA topoisomerases positively correlated with its mitochondrial accumulation. Molecular docking provided more detailed structural insights into the interactions of OPT or PPT with DNA and topoisomerase I/IIα. The binding sites of OPT and PPT in topoisomerase-DNA complexes are different from each other. Aside from previously revealed DNA and mitochondrial targets, this study discovered new evidence that DNA topoisomerases may also serve as targets of monofunctional platinum(ii) complexes. For a multispecific platinum complex, strong DNA binding ability does not necessarily lead to potent cytotoxicity as other factors including the cell types, mitochondrial accumulation, and activity of DNA topoisomerases also affect the outcome of DNA damage.""","""['Hongmei Zhang', 'Tao Yang', 'Yanqing Wang', 'Zenghui Wang', 'Zhenzhu Zhu', 'Zijian Guo', 'Xiaoyong Wang']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Dalton Trans""","""['Mitochondrion-targeted platinum complexes suppressing lung cancer through multiple pathways involving energy metabolism.', 'Platinum complexes as inhibitors of DNA repair protein Ku70 and topoisomerase IIα in cancer cells.', 'Enhancing Cytotoxicity of a Monofunctional Platinum Complex via a Dual-DNA-Damage Approach.', 'Topoisomerases as anticancer targets.', 'DNA topoisomerases as molecular targets for anticancer drugs.', 'Manganese(ii) complexes stimulate antitumor immunity via aggravating DNA damage and activating the cGAS-STING pathway.']"""

Median time to progression and median survival were 4 and 11 years, respectively, for men with non-metastatic (nm) hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (HSPC); 1 and 7 years for men with metastatic (m) HSPC; and 1 and 8.5 years for men with nm castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Median survival for men with mCRPC was 4 years. Total annual mean costs for HRU per patient increased with increasing severity of disease, from 41,064 Swedish krona (SEK) for nmHSPC to 288,242 SEK for mCRPC.  Conclusion:   Progression time from mHSPC and nmCRPC to the mCRPC state was short and survival in the mCRPC state was approximately 4 years. Survival times were longer than expected, likely due to the selection of long-term survivors among prevalent cases. Healthcare costs were high for men with mCRPC. Further studies are needed to confirm our pilot study findings.""","""['Johanna Svensson', 'Ingela Franck Lissbrant', 'Oskar Gauffin', 'Marie Hjälm-Eriksson', 'Suzanne Kilany', 'Karin Fagerlund', 'Pär Stattin']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Scand J Urol""","""['The Health Economics of Metastatic Hormone-Sensitive and Non-Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer-A Systematic Literature Review with Application to the Canadian Context.', 'Economic Outcomes in Patients with Chemotherapy-Naïve Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer Treated with Enzalutamide or Abiraterone Acetate Plus Prednisone.', 'Predictors of survival, healthcare resource utilization, and healthcare costs in veterans with non-metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Total cost of care for castration-resistant prostate cancer in a commercially insured population and a medicare supplemental insured population.', 'Evolving understanding and categorization of prostate cancer: preventing progression to metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer: RADAR IV.', 'Testosterone Therapy in Advanced Prostate Cancer.', 'Modeling Disease Trajectories for Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer Using Nationwide Population-based Data.', 'Effect of Bicalutamide Combined with Docetaxel on Serum PSA and VEGF Levels in Patients with Advanced Prostate Carcinoma.', 'Patterns of care for non-metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer: A population-based study.', 'The Health Economics of Metastatic Hormone-Sensitive and Non-Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer-A Systematic Literature Review with Application to the Canadian Context.']"""

Sparse partial least squares-discriminant analyses were performed to identify features associated with biochemical recurrence (BCR) in each type of omics data. Selected features predicted BCR with a balanced error rate (BER) of 0.20 to 0.51 in single-omics and of 0.05 in multi-omics analyses. Amongst features associated with BCR were genes from the Immunoglobulin Ig-like Receptor (LILR) family which are immune checkpoints with immunotherapeutic potential. Using Multivariate INTegrative (MINT) analysis, the association of five LILR genes with BCR was quantified in a combination of three RNA-seq datasets and confirmed with Kaplan-Meier analysis in both these and in an independent RNA-seq dataset. Finally, immunohistochemistry showed that a high number of LILRB1 positive cells within the tumors predicted long-term adverse outcomes.

To identify genes that support enzalutamide resistance, we performed a short hairpin RNA (shRNA) screen in the bone-homing, castration-resistant prostate cancer cell line, C4-2B. We identified 11 genes (TFAP2C, CAD, SPDEF, EIF6, GABRG2, CDC37, PSMD12, COL5A2, AR, MAP3K11, and ACAT1) whose loss resulted in decreased cell survival in response to enzalutamide. To validate our screen, we performed transient knockdowns in C4-2B and 22Rv1 cells and evaluated cell survival in response to enzalutamide. Through these studies, we validated three genes (ACAT1, MAP3K11, and PSMD12) as supporters of enzalutamide resistance in vitro Although ACAT1 expression is lower in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer samples versus primary prostate cancer samples, knockdown of ACAT1 was sufficient to reduce cell survival in C4-2B and 22Rv1 cells. MAP3K11 expression increases with Gleason grade, and the highest expression is observed in metastatic castration-resistant disease. Knockdown of MAP3K11 reduced cell survival, and pharmacologic inhibition of MAP3K11 with CEP-1347 in combination with enzalutamide resulted in a dramatic increase in cell death. This was associated with decreased phosphorylation of AR-Serine650, which is required for maximal AR activation. Finally, although PSMD12 expression did not change during disease progression, knockdown of PSMD12 resulted in decreased AR and AR splice variant expression, likely contributing to the C4-2B and 22Rv1 decrease in cell survival.

However, the exact mechanism by which CD82 prevents cancer metastasis is unclear. This study aims to identify genes that are regulated by CD82 in human prostate cell lines.  Methods:   We used whole human genome microarray to obtain gene expression profiles in a normal prostate epithelial cell line that expressed CD82 (PrEC-31) and a metastatic prostate cell line that does not express CD82 (PC3). Then, siRNA silencing was used to knock down CD82 expression in PrEC-31 while CD82 was re-expressed in PC3 to acquire differentially-expressed genes in the respective cell line.  Results:   Differentially-expressed genes with a P < 0.05 were identified in 3 data sets: PrEC-31 (+CD82) vs PrEC-31(-CD82), PC3-57 (+CD82) vs. PC3-5 V (-CD82), and PC3-29 (+CD82) vs. PC3-5 V (-CD82). Top 25 gene lists did not show overlap within the data sets, except (CALB1) the calcium binding protein calbindin 1 which was significantly up-regulated (2.8 log fold change) in PrEC-31 and PC3-29 cells that expressed CD82. Other most significantly up-regulated genes included serine peptidase inhibitor kazal type 1 (SPINK1) and polypeptide N-acetyl galactosaminyl transferase 14 (GALNT14) and most down-regulated genes included C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 14 (CXCL14), urotensin 2 (UTS2D), and fibroblast growth factor 13 (FGF13). Pathways related with cell proliferation and angiogenesis, migration and invasion, cell death, cell cycle, signal transduction, and metabolism were highly enriched in cells that lack CD82 expression. Expression of two mutually inclusive genes in top 100 gene lists of all data sets, runt-related transcription factor (RUNX3) and trefoil factor 3 (TFF3), could be validated with qRT-PCR.

Inclusion of survival times that would be deemed clinically similar attenuates the concordance and moves the estimate away from the contrast-of-interest: comparing the risk scores between individuals with disparate survival times. In this manuscript, we propose a concordance definition and corresponding method to estimate the probability conditional on survival times being separated by at least a minimum difference. The proposed estimate requires direct input from the analyst to identify a separable survival region and, in doing so, is analogous to the clinically defined subgroups used for binary outcome area under the curve estimates.

The glycolytic inhibitor 2-Deoxy-d-glucose (2-DG) has shown potential in combination with other anticancer agents. Buforin IIb is an effective antimicrobial peptide (AMP) with broad-spectrum anticancer activity and selectivity. The efficacy of combination treatment with 2-DG and buforin IIb in prostate cancer remains unknown. Here, we tested the efficacy of buforin IIb as a mitochondria-targeting AMP in the androgen-independent human prostate cancer cell line DU145. Combining 2-DG with buforin IIb had a synergistic toxic effect on DU145 cells and mouse xenograft tumors. Combination treatment with 2-DG and buforin IIb caused stronger proliferation inhibition, greater G1 cell cycle arrest, and higher apoptosis than either treatment alone. Combination treatment dramatically decreased L-lactate production and intracellular ATP levels, indicating severe inhibition of glycolysis and ATP production. Flow cytometry and confocal laser scanning microscopy results indicate that 2-DG may increase buforin IIb uptake by DU145 cells, thereby increasing the mitochondria-targeting capacity of buforin IIb. This may partly explain the effect of combination treatment on enhancing buforin IIb-induced apoptosis. Consistently, 2-DG increased mitochondrial dysfunction and upregulated Bax/Bcl-2, promoting cytochrome c release to initiate procaspase 3 cleavage induced by buforin IIb. These results suggest that 2-DG sensitizes prostate cancer DU145 cells to buforin IIb. Moreover, combination treatment caused minimal hemolysis and cytotoxicity to normal WPMY-1 cells. Collectively, the current study demonstrates that dual targeting of glycolysis and mitochondria by 2-DG and buforin IIb may be an effective anticancer strategy for the treatment of some advanced prostate cancer.""","""['Yangke Wanyan', 'Xixi Xu', 'Kehang Liu', 'Huidan Zhang', 'Junai Zhen', 'Rong Zhang', 'Jumei Wen', 'Ping Liu', 'Yuqing Chen']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Molecules""","""['Synergism of ursolic acid derivative US597 with 2-deoxy-D-glucose to preferentially induce tumor cell death by dual-targeting of apoptosis and glycolysis.', 'Mechanism of anticancer activity of buforin IIb, a histone H2A-derived peptide.', 'Buforin IIb induces androgen-independent prostate cancer cells apoptosis though p53 pathway in vitro.', 'From delocalized lipophilic cations to hypoxia: blocking tumor cell mitochondrial function leads to therapeutic gain with glycolytic inhibitors.', 'The cancer cell\'s ""power plants"" as promising therapeutic targets: an overview.', '2-Deoxy-D-Glucose: A Novel Pharmacological Agent for Killing Hypoxic Tumor Cells, Oxygen Dependence-Lowering in Covid-19, and Other Pharmacological Activities.', 'Unraveling the Peculiar Features of Mitochondrial Metabolism and Dynamics in Prostate Cancer.', 'The IRF2/CENP-N/AKT signaling axis promotes proliferation, cell cycling and apoptosis resistance in nasopharyngeal carcinoma cells by increasing aerobic glycolysis.']"""

Furthermore, MC-LR notably increased angiogenesis and susceptibility to prostate cancer in vivo. In vitro, over 25 weeks of MC-LR exposure, normal human prostate epithelial (RWPE-1) cells increased secretion of matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2), matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), and colony formation, features typical for cancer cells. These MC-LR-transformed prostate epithelial cells displayed increased expression of forkhead box M1 (FOXM1) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2); abrogation of FOXM1 or COX-2 activity by specific inhibitors could abolish the invasion and migration of MC-LR-treated cells. In conclusion, we have provided compelling evidence demonstrating the induction of a malignant phenotype in human prostate epithelial cells and the in vivo development of prostate cancer by exposure to MC-LR, which might be a potential tumor promoter in the progression of prostate cancer.""","""['Chun Pan', 'Ling Zhang', 'Xiannan Meng', 'Haixiang Qin', 'Zou Xiang', 'Wenyue Gong', 'Wenxin Luo', 'Dongmei Li', 'Xiaodong Han']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Chemosphere""","""['Chronic exposure to microcystin-leucine-arginine promoted proliferation of prostate epithelial cells resulting in benign prostatic hyperplasia.', 'Toxic effects of microcystin-LR on the development of prostate in mice.', 'Microcystin-leucine-arginine causes blood-testis barrier disruption and degradation of occludin mediated by matrix metalloproteinase-8.', 'Effects of microcystin-LR exposure on matrix metalloproteinase-2/-9 expression and cancer cell migration.', 'Molecular aspects of microcystin-induced hepatotoxicity and hepatocarcinogenesis.', 'Microcystin‑leucine arginine promotes colorectal cancer cell proliferation by activating the PI3K/Akt/Wnt/β‑catenin pathway.', 'Individual and Combined Effect of Bisphenol A and Bisphenol AF on Prostate Cell Proliferation through NF-κB Signaling Pathway.', 'Microcystin-LR in Primary Liver Cancers: An Overview.', 'Movement Disorder and Neurotoxicity Induced by Chronic Exposure to Microcystin-LR in Mice.', 'Cyanotoxins and Food Contamination in Developing Countries: Review of Their Types, Toxicity, Analysis, Occurrence and Mitigation Strategies.']"""

The escape of disseminated tumor cells from cellular dormancy is a major cause of recurrence in marrow. Abscisic acid (ABA), a phytohormone, is known to regulate dormancy of plant seeds and to regulate other stress responses in plants. Recently, ABA was found to be synthesized by mammals cells and has been linked to human disease. Yet the role of ABA in regulating tumor dormancy or reactivation is unknown. We found that ABA is produced by human marrow cells, and exogenous ABA inhibits PCa cell proliferation while increasing the expression of p27, p21, and p16 and decreasing the expression of the proliferation marker, Ki67. Further, ABA significantly increased the percentage of PCa cells in the G0 phase of the cell cycle as well as the duration the cells were arrested in G0. We found that ABA regulates an increase of PPARγ receptor expression and suppressed phosphorylation of mTOR/p70S6K signaling and resulting in the induction of the cellular dormancy. We then confirmed that ABA regulates G0 cell cycle arrest through PPARγ receptor signaling in vitro and under co-culture conditions with osteoblasts. Finally, we demonstrate that ABA regulates PCa dormancy in vivo following intratibial injection in an animal model. Together these data suggest that the ABA and PPARγ signaling pathways contribute to the establishment of PCa cellular dormancy in the bone marrow microenvironment. These findings may suggest critical pathways for targeting metastatic disease.""","""['Younghun Jung', 'Frank C Cackowski', 'Kenji Yumoto', 'Ann M Decker', 'Yu Wang', 'Megan Hotchkin', 'Eunsohl Lee', 'Laura Buttitta', 'Russell S Taichman']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Neoplasia""","""['Endogenous GAS6 and Mer receptor signaling regulate prostate cancer stem cells in bone marrow.', 'TBK1 regulates prostate cancer dormancy through mTOR inhibition.', 'Mer Tyrosine Kinase Regulates Disseminated Prostate Cancer Cellular Dormancy.', 'The biology and clinical implications of prostate cancer dormancy and metastasis.', 'Breast Cancer Dormancy in Bone.', 'Bone marrow adipocytes induce cancer-associated fibroblasts and immune evasion, enhancing invasion and drug resistance.', 'The Effects of Abscisic Acid on Angiogenesis in Both ex vivo and in vivo Assays.', 'Molecular events confirming antimutagenicity to abscisic acid derived from a floral honey establishing its functional relevance.', 'Cross Talk Between Macrophages and Cancer Cells in the Bone Metastatic Environment.', 'Multi-Targeted Molecular Docking, Pharmacokinetics, and Drug-Likeness Evaluation of Okra-Derived Ligand Abscisic Acid Targeting Signaling Proteins Involved in the Development of Diabetes.']"""

Locally measured cell elastic properties, described by the parameter known as Young's modulus, are currently proposed as a new diagnostic parameter that can be used at the early stage of cancer detection. In this study, local mechanical properties of normal human prostate (RWPE-1) cells and a range of malignant (22Rv1) and metastatic prostate cells (LNCaP, Du145 and PC3) were investigated. It was found that non-malignant prostate cells are stiffer than cancer cells while the metastatic cells are much softer than malignant cells from the primary tumor site. Next, the biochemical properties of the cells were measured using confocal Raman (RS) and Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopies to reveal these cells' biochemical composition as malignant transformation proceeds. Nanomechanical and biochemical profiles of five different prostate cell lines were subsequently analyzed using partial least squares regression (PLSR) in order to identify which spectral features of the RS and FT-IR spectra correlate with the cell's elastic properties. The PLSR-based model could predict Young's modulus values based on both RS and FT-IR spectral information. These outcomes show not only that AFM, RS and FT-IR techniques can be used for discrimination between normal and cancer cells, but also that a linear correlation between mechanical response and biomolecular composition of the cells that undergo malignant transformation can be found.

Design, setting, participants:   Retrospective cohort study; analysis of South Australian Cancer Registry data for all people diagnosed with cancer during 1990-1999 and alive five years after diagnosis, with follow-up to 31 December 2016.  Main outcome measures:   All-cause and cancer cause-specific mortality, by cancer diagnosis; standardised mortality ratios (study group v SA general population) by sex, age at diagnosis, follow-up period, and index cancer.  Results:   Of 32 646 people with cancer alive five years after diagnosis, 30 309 were of European background (93%) and 16 400 were males (50%); the mean age at diagnosis was 60.3 years (SD, 15.7 years). The median follow-up time was 17 years (IQR, 11-21 years); 17 268 deaths were recorded (53% of patients; mean age, 80.6 years; SD, 11.4 years): 7845 attributed to cancer (45% of deaths) and 9423 attributed to non-cancer causes (55%). Ischaemic heart disease was the leading cause of death (2393 deaths), followed by prostate cancer (1424), cerebrovascular disease (1175), and breast cancer (1118). The overall standardised mortality ratio (adjusted for age, sex, and year of diagnosis) was 1.24 (95% CI, 1.22-1.25). The cumulative number of cardiovascular deaths exceeded that of cancer cause-specific deaths from 13 years after cancer diagnosis.

Glycoprotein M6B (GPM6B) is a transmembrane protein that belongs to the proteolipid protein family. GPM6B has been proved and can be used as a biomarker for gynecological malignancies and breast carcinoma. However, there are no studies that explored the functions of GPM6B in PCa.

The GPM6B expression in PCa patient's tumor tissues was significantly related to clinical stage, T classification, lymph node metastasis, and distant metastasis, but not significantly related to age and Gleason score. Also, patients with highGPM6B expression had a better prognosis. The overexpression of GPM6B in prostate cancer cells could inhibit cell proliferation. Serotonin treatment could enhance the proliferation of PCa cell lines; moreover, fluoxetine could reverse this result. In conclusion, we identified GPM6B as a tumor suppressor in PCa. In mechanism, it can regulate the uptaking of serotonin and inhibit the growth of prostate cancer. These results suggested the potential function of GPM6B as a diagnostic marker of PCa and provided clues for the development of new treatment targets for PCa.""","""['Siyuan He', 'Zhenlin Huang', 'Xiang Li', 'Yinghui Ding', 'Haoyue Sheng', 'Bowen Liu', 'Zhankui Jia']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Dis Markers""","""['Down-regulation of protein kinase, DNA-activated, catalytic polypeptide attenuates tumor progression and is an independent prognostic predictor of survival in prostate cancer.', 'Identification of candidate diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for human prostate cancer: RPL22L1 and RPS21.', 'More advantages in detecting bone and soft tissue metastases from prostate cancer using 18F-PSMA PET/CT.', 'The association of CXCR4 expression with clinicopathological significance and potential drug target in prostate cancer: a meta-analysis and literature review.', 'Functions and mechanisms of N6‑methyladenosine in prostate cancer (Review).', 'Tumor cell plasticity in endometrioid carcinoma is regulated by neuronal membrane glycoprotein M6-b.', 'Integrated analysis reveals prognostic value and mesenchymal identity suppression by glycoprotein M6B in glioma.']"""

Specifically, 11,984 men (6,196 prostate cancer cases and 5,788 controls) of European ancestry from Northern California Kaiser Permanente were genotyped and meta-analyzed with 196,269 men of European ancestry (7,917 prostate cancer cases and 188,352 controls) from the UK Biobank. Three novel loci, including two rare variants (European ancestry minor allele frequency < 0.01, at 3p21.31 and 8p12), were significant genome wide in a meta-analysis. Gene-based rare variant tests implicated a known prostate cancer gene (HOXB13), as well as a novel candidate gene (ILDR1), which encodes a receptor highly expressed in prostate tissue and is related to the B7/CD28 family of T-cell immune checkpoint markers. Haplotypic patterns of long-range linkage disequilibrium were observed for rare genetic variants at HOXB13 and other loci, reflecting their evolutionary history. In addition, a polygenic risk score (PRS) of 188 prostate cancer variants was strongly associated with risk (90th vs. 40th-60th percentile OR = 2.62, P = 2.55 × 10-191). Many of the 188 variants exhibited functional signatures of gene expression regulation or transcription factor binding, including a 6-fold difference in log-probability of androgen receptor binding at the variant rs2680708 (17q22). Rare variant and PRS associations, with concomitant functional interpretation of risk mechanisms, can help clarify the full genetic architecture of prostate cancer and other complex traits.

In this study, we developed a CD46-targeted PET radiopharmaceutical, [89Zr]DFO-YS5, and evaluated its performance for immunoPET imaging in murine prostate cancer models.  Experimental design:   [89Zr]DFO-YS5 was prepared and its in vitro binding affinity for CD46 was measured. ImmunoPET imaging was conducted in male athymic nu/nu mice bearing DU145 [AR-, CD46+, prostate-specific membrane antigen-negative (PSMA-)] or 22Rv1 (AR+, CD46+, PSMA+) tumors, and in NOD/SCID gamma mice bearing patient-derived adenocarcinoma xenograft, LTL-331, and neuroendocrine prostate cancers, LTL-331R and LTL-545.  Results:   [89Zr]DFO-YS5 binds specifically to the CD46-positive human prostate cancer DU145 and 22Rv1 xenografts. In biodistribution studies, the tumor uptake of [89Zr]DFO-YS5 was 13.3 ± 3.9 and 11.2 ± 2.5 %ID/g, respectively, in DU145 and 22Rv1 xenografts, 4 days postinjection. Notably, [89Zr]DFO-YS5 demonstrated specific uptake in the PSMA- and AR-negative DU145 model. [89Zr]DFO-YS5 also showed uptake in the patient-derived LTL-331 and -331R models, with particularly high uptake in the LTL-545 neuroendocrine prostate cancer tumors (18.8 ± 5.3, 12.5 ± 1.8, and 32 ± 5.3 %ID/g in LTL-331, LTL-331R, and LTL-545, respectively, at 4 days postinjection).  Conclusions:   [89Zr]DFO-YS5 is an excellent PET imaging agent across a panel of prostate cancer models, including in both adenocarcinoma and neuroendocrine prostate cancer, both cell line- and patient-derived xenografts, and both PSMA-positive and -negative tumors.

Taxol derivatives-based chemotherapies or immunotherapies are usually proposed depending on the symptomatic status of the patient. In the case of immunotherapy, tumors develop robust immune escape mechanisms that abolish any protective response, and to date why prostate cancer is one of the most resistant diseases remains unresolved.  Methods:   By using a combination of clinical data to study the transcriptome of metastasis samples from patients with castration-refractory prostate cancer, and state of the art cellular and molecular biology assays in samples from tumor-bearing mice that have been submitted to surgical resection of the tumor before receiving a vaccination, we answered several essential questions in the field of immunotherapy for prostate cancer. We also used two different methods to inhibit the expression of galectin-3 (Gal-3) in tumor cells: a stable RNA interference method to control the expression of this galectin efficiently only in tumor cells, and low and non-cytotoxic doses of docetaxel to easily transfer our findings to clinical settings.  Results:   Herein, we show for the first time that Gal-3 expressed by prostate tumor cells is the main immune checkpoint responsible for the failure of vaccine-based immunotherapy. Our results show that low and non-cytotoxic doses of docetaxel lead to the inhibition of Gal-3 expression in PCa cells as well as in clinical samples of patients with metastatic and castration-resistant PCa promoting a Th1 response. We thus optimized a prostate cancer animal model that undergoes surgical resection of the tumor to mimic prostatectomy usually performed in patients. Importantly, using Gal-3-knocked down-PCa cells or low and non-cytotoxic doses of taxane before vaccination, we were able to highly control tumor recurrence through a direct impact on the proliferation and infiltration of CD8+ cytotoxic T.  Conclusions:   Thus, Gal-3 expression by PCa cells is a crucial inhibitor for the success of immunotherapy, and low doses of docetaxel with non-cytotoxic effect on leukocyte survival could be used before immunotherapy for all patients with PCa to reduce the expression of this critical negative immune checkpoint, pre-conditioning the tumor-microenvironment to activate an antitumor immune response and promote tumor-free outcome.""","""['Carolina Tiraboschi', 'Lucas Gentilini', 'Carla Velazquez', 'Enrique Corapi', 'Felipe Martín Jaworski', 'José Daniel Garcia Garcia', 'Yorfer Rondón', 'Anne Chauchereau', 'Diego José Laderach', 'Daniel Compagno']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""J Immunother Cancer""","""['Endogenous Galectin-1 in T Lymphocytes Regulates Anti-prostate Cancer Immunity.', 'Docetaxel remodels prostate cancer immune microenvironment and enhances checkpoint inhibitor-based immunotherapy.', 'Immunotherapy in treatment of metastatic prostate cancer: An approach to circumvent immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment.', 'Galectin-3 in Prostate Cancer Stem-Like Cells Is Immunosuppressive and Drives Early Metastasis.', 'Current vaccination strategies for prostate cancer.', 'Molecular regulation of prostate cancer by Galectin-3 and estrogen receptor.', 'Galectins as pivotal components in oncogenesis and immune exclusion in human malignancies.', 'Targeting galectin-driven regulatory circuits in cancer and fibrosis.', 'Inhibition of galectins in cancer: Biological challenges for their clinical application.', 'Unraveling How Tumor-Derived Galectins Contribute to Anti-Cancer Immunity Failure.']"""

Here, we analyzed the relationship of aspirin intake with prostate cancer risk and mortality among African-American men in the Southern Community Cohort Study (SCCS).  Methods:   SCCS recruited 22,426 African-American men between 2002 and 2009. Aspirin use was assessed at enrollment. Our exposures of interest were any aspirin use (regular strength, low-dose or baby aspirin, or half tablets of aspirin) and regular strength aspirin. Each exposure variable was compared with nonusers. Associations between aspirin use and prostate cancer risk and mortality were examined with Cox proportional hazards models.  Results:   At enrollment, 5,486 men (25.1%) reported taking any aspirin and 2,634 men (12.1%) reported regular strength aspirin use. During follow-up (median, 13 years), 1,058 men developed prostate cancer, including 103 prostate cancer-specific deaths. Aspirin use was not associated with prostate cancer development [adjusted HR, 1.07; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.92-1.25 for any aspirin use and HR, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.78-1.19 for regular strength aspirin], but was suggestively associated with reduced prostate cancer mortality (HR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.39-1.14 for any aspirin use and HR, 0.41; 95% CI, 0.17-1.00 for regular strength aspirin).

Objective:   To describe contemporary UTUC incidence and mortality rates in the USA.  Design, setting, and participants:   Within the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) database (2004-2016), we identified 13 075 UTUC patients. Of all, 9208 (70.4%) harbored nonmetastatic UTUC and were treated with radical nephroureterectomy versus 1174 (9.0%) who harbored metastatic UTUC.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Age-standardized incidence rates per 100 000 person years were calculated. Kaplan-Meier curves and multivariable Cox regression models addressed cancer-specific and overall mortality.  Results and limitations:   Overall UTUC age-standardized incidence rates decreased from 1.3 to 1.1 cases per 100 000 person years (average annual percentage change: -1.32%, p = 0.002). Moreover, age-standardized incidence rates decreased for T1-2N0M0 (average annual percentage change: -2.77%, p < 0.001) but increased for T1-4N0-2M1 stage (average annual percentage change: +2.87%, p < 0.01). In nonmetastatic UTUC treated with radical nephroureterectomy, stage, grade, age, and sex (p < 0.001) were independent predictors in multivariable Cox regression models focusing on cancer-specific mortality. In metastatic UTUC, chemotherapy administration, radical nephroureterectomy treatment, and ureteral primary were independent predictors of lower overall mortality in multivariable Cox regression models.  Conclusions:   Although overall incidence of UTUC decreased, the incidence of metastatic UTUC increased over the study period. The majority of nonmetastatic UTUC harbored T1N0M0 stage. However, T3N0M0, T4N0M0, and T1-4N1-2M0 stages, respectively, affected 28.9%, 4.6%, and 10.0% of all incident cases. In metastatic UTUC, both chemotherapy and radical nephroureterectomy use exerted an important protective effect on overall mortality, and ureteral primaries exhibited more favorable survival.

Objective:   To determine whether EPLND has better oncological outcomes than limited PLND (LPLND.  Design, setting and participants:   This was a prospective, single-center phase 3 trial in patients with intermediate- or high-risk clinically localized PCa.  Intervention:   Randomization (1:1) to LPLND (obturator nodes) or EPLND (obturator, external iliac, internal iliac, common iliac, and presacral nodes) bilaterally.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   The primary endpoint was biochemical recurrence-free survival (BRFS). Secondary outcomes were metastasis-free survival (MFS), cancer-specific survival (CSS), and histopathological findings. The trial was designed to show a minimal 15% advantage in 5-yr BRFS by EPLND.  Results and limitations:   In total, 300 patients were randomized from May 2012 to December 2016 (150 LPLND and 150 EPLND). The median BRFS was 61.4 mo in the LPLND group and not reached in the EPLND group (hazard ratio [HR] 0.91, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.63-1.32; p = 0.6). Median MFS was not reached in either group (HR 0.57, 95% CI 0.17-1.8; p = 0.3). CSS data were not available because no patient died from PCa before the cutoff date. In exploratory subgroup analysis, patients with preoperative biopsy International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) grade groups 3-5 who were allocated to EPLND had better BRFS (HR 0.33, 95% CI 0.14-0.74, interaction p = 0.007). The short follow-up and surgeon heterogeneity are limitations to this study.  Conclusion:   This RCT confirms that EPLND provides better pathological staging, while differences in early oncological outcomes were not demonstrated. Our subgroup analysis suggests a potential BCRFS benefit in patients diagnosed with ISUP grade groups 3-5; however, these findings should be considered hypothesis-generating and further RCTs with larger cohorts and longer follow up are necessary to better define the role of EPLND during RP.

In almost all kinds of cancers, lncRNAs participated in the process of pathogenesis, invasion, and metastasis. Meanwhile, compared with the large amounts of patients, there is rare knowledge about the role of lncRNAs in prostate cancer (PCa).  Material/method:   In this study, lncRNA expression profiles of prostate cancer were detected by Agilent microarray chip, 5 pairs of case and control specimens were involved in. Differentially expressed lncRNAs were screened out by volcano plot for constructing lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA central network. Then, the top ten up-regulated and down-regulated lncRNAs were validated by qRT-PCR in another 5 tumor specimens and 7 para-cancerous/benign contrasts. Furthermore, we searched for the survival curve of the top 10 upregulated and downregulated lncRNAs.  Results:   A total of 817 differentially expressed lncRNAs were filtered out by the criteria of fold change (FC) and t-test p < 0.05. Among them, 422 were upregulated, whereas 395 were downregulated in PCa tissues. Gene ontology and KEGG pathway analyses showed that many lncRNAs were implicated in carcinogenesis. lnc-MYL2-4:1 (FC = 0.00141, p = 0.01909) and NR_125857 (FC = 59.27658, p = 0.00128) had the highest magnitude of change. The subsequent qPCR confirmed the expression of NR_125857 was in accordance with the clinical samples. High expression of PCA3, PCAT14 and AP001610.9 led to high hazard ratio while low expression of RP11-279F6.2 led to high hazard ratio.  Conclusions:   Our study detected a relatively novel complicated map of lncRNAs in PCa, which may have the potential to investigate for diagnosis, treatment and follow-up in PCa. Our study revealed the expression of NR_125857 in human PCa tissues was most up-regulated.

Optimal control analysis shows that an increasing dose titration protocol, a very common clinical dosing process, can achieve tumor stabilization for a wide range of potential initial tumor compositions and volumes. Furthermore, larger tumor volumes may counter intuitively be more likely to be stabilized if sensitive cells dominate the tumor composition at time of initial treatment, suggesting a delay of initial treatment could prove beneficial.

Cross-phenotype association tests are often used to jointly analyze multiple traits from a genome-wide association study (GWAS). The underlying methods, however, are often designed to test the global null hypothesis that there is no association of a genetic variant with any of the traits, the rejection of which does not implicate pleiotropy. In this article, we propose a new statistical approach, PLACO, for specifically detecting pleiotropic loci between two traits by considering an underlying composite null hypothesis that a variant is associated with none or only one of the traits. We propose testing the null hypothesis based on the product of the Z-statistics of the genetic variants across two studies and derive a null distribution of the test statistic in the form of a mixture distribution that allows for fractions of variants to be associated with none or only one of the traits. We borrow approaches from the statistical literature on mediation analysis that allow asymptotic approximation of the null distribution avoiding estimation of nuisance parameters related to mixture proportions and variance components. Simulation studies demonstrate that the proposed method can maintain type I error and can achieve major power gain over alternative simpler methods that are typically used for testing pleiotropy. PLACO allows correlation in summary statistics between studies that may arise due to sharing of controls between disease traits. Application of PLACO to publicly available summary data from two large case-control GWAS of Type 2 Diabetes and of Prostate Cancer implicated a number of novel shared genetic regions: 3q23 (ZBTB38), 6q25.3 (RGS17), 9p22.1 (HAUS6), 9p13.3 (UBAP2), 11p11.2 (RAPSN), 14q12 (AKAP6), 15q15 (KNL1) and 18q23 (ZNF236).""","""['Debashree Ray', 'Nilanjan Chatterjee']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""PLoS Genet""","""['Pleiotropy informed adaptive association test of multiple traits using genome-wide association study summary data.', 'Estimating and testing pleiotropy of single genetic variant for two quantitative traits.', 'Identifying pleiotropic genes for complex phenotypes with summary statistics from a perspective of composite null hypothesis testing.', 'Multivariate analysis of genome-wide data to identify potential pleiotropic genes for type 2 diabetes, obesity and coronary artery disease using MetaCCA.', 'Comprehensive identification of pleiotropic loci for body fat distribution using the NHGRI-EBI Catalog of published genome-wide association studies.', 'GCPBayes pipeline: a tool for exploring pleiotropy at the\xa0gene level.', 'Characterizing common and rare variations in non-traditional glycemic biomarkers using multivariate approaches on multi-ancestry ARIC study.', 'A genome-wide search for pleiotropy in more than 100,000 harmonized longitudinal cognitive domain scores.', 'Evaluating significance of European-associated index SNPs in the East Asian population for 31 complex phenotypes.', 'Similarity and diversity of genetic architecture for complex traits between East Asian and European populations.']"""

Lymphedema (LE) represents a common and devastating sequela of neoplastic therapies, even if its incidence in patients submitted to lymphadenectomy for prostatic cancer is still poorly documented. The purpose of the current study was to analyze the imaging findings provided by noncontrast magnetic resonance (MR) lymphography in secondary lower limb LE related to prostate cancer therapies. Methods and Results: Patients with diagnosed secondary LE related to prostatic cancer treatment who underwent noncontrast MR lymphography (NCMRL) between November 2019 and February 2020 were assessed. Image datasets were retrospectively reviewed for the severity of lymphedema and characteristics of the subcutaneous tissue, muscular compartment appearance, number of iliac and inguinal lymphatics, and number of locoregional lymph nodes. Ten patients with 17 affected lower extremities, nine right extremities, and eight left extremities were included in our analysis. Magnetic resonance imaging grading was classified as one in four extremities, two in five extremities, and three in eight lower extremities. Honeycomb pattern was observed in 15 extremities, without significant correlation with MR grading (p = 0.684); dermal thickening showed correlation with MR grading (p < 0.001), as well as reduction of muscular trophism (p = 0.021). We observed a significant correlation between the number of inguinal lymph nodes and recognizable inguinal lymphatics (p = 0.039).

Herein, a peptide cleavage-mediated and environmentally friendly photocurrent polarity switching system was developed for ultrasensitive and highly selective detection of PSA based on the efficiently switching of photocurrent polarity of silver indium sulfide nanoparticles (AgInS2 NPs)-coated indium tin oxide (ITO) electrode by amino-functionalized CuO cubes (NH2-CuO). The porous CuO cubes were synthesized by calcination of HKUST-1 and functionalized with aminosilane. In the presence of PSA, the biotin and rhodamine B-labeled peptide (Bio-Pep-RhB) was cleaved and part of the peptide (P-Pep-RhB) was obtained by magnetic separation. Through host-guest recognition between β-CD and RhB, the P-Pep-RhB was immobilized on the β-CD/AgInS2 NPs/ITO electrode. Then, the amino-rich sequence on P-Pep-RhB combined with NH2-CuO via glutaraldehyde results in the switch of anodic photocurrent to cathodic photocurrent. On account of the high-efficient peptide cleaving strategy and the new photocurrent polarity switching system of porous CuO cubes//AgInS2 NPs, the prepared sensing platform displayed outstanding analytical performance for PSA with a wide linear response range (0.1 pg mL-1-100 ng mL-1) and a lower detection limit of 0.06 pg mL-1.

Objective:   To investigate the association of SDT of radical prostatectomy and final pathological and survival outcomes.  Design, setting, and participants:   This cohort study used data from the US National Cancer Database (NCDB) and identified all patients with clinically localized (cT1-2cN0cM0) high-risk prostate adenocarcinoma diagnosed between 2006 and 2016 who underwent radical prostatectomy. Data analyses were performed from April 1 to April 12, 2020.  Exposures:   SDT was defined as the number of days between the initial cancer diagnosis and radical prostatectomy. SDT was categorized into 5 groups: 31 to 60, 61 to 90, 91 to 120, 121 to 150, and 151 to 180 days.  Main outcomes and measures:   The primary outcomes were predetermined as adverse pathological outcomes after radical prostatectomy, including pT3-T4 disease, pN-positive disease, and positive surgical margin. The adverse pathological score (APS) was defined as an accumulated score of the 3 outcomes (0-3). An APS of 2 or higher was considered a separate outcome to capture cases with more aggressive pathological features. The secondary outcome was overall survival.  Results:   Of the 32 184 patients included in the study, the median (interquartile range) age was 64 (59-68) years, and 25 548 (79.4%) were non-Hispanic White. Compared with an SDT of 31 to 60 days, longer SDTs were not associated with higher risks of having any adverse pathological outcomes (odds ratio [OR], 0.95; 95% CI, 0.80-1.12; P = .53), pT3-T4 disease (OR, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.83-1.17; P = .87), pN-positive disease (OR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.59-1.06; P = .12), positive surgical margin (OR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.74-1.05; P = .17), or APS greater than or equal to 2 (OR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.74-1.05; P = .17).

The results showed that Cluster I was associated with advanced PCa and was more likely to respond to immunotherapy. The findings demonstrated that differences in immune responses may be important drivers of PCa progression and response to treatment.

Using polymeric horseradish peroxidase (poly-HRP, 400 HRPs) labels to provide large signal amplification and limits of detection in the sub-fg mL-1 range, a protocol was devised for the optimization of the fast, accurate assays of 100-fold diluted serum samples. Analysis of 130 prostate cancer patient serum samples revealed that some members of the protein panel can distinguish aggressive from indolent cancers. Logistic regression was used to identify a subset of the panel, combining biomarker proteins ETS-related gene protein (ERG), insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), pigment epithelial-derived factor (PEDF), and serum monocyte differentiation antigen (CD-14) to predict whether a given patient should be referred for biopsy, which gave a much better predictive accuracy than PSA alone.

Methods:   From 2005 to 2010, 1679 consecutive patients underwent transperitoneal RALP. Data was retrospectively collected by an independent statistical company and analyzed in 2014. Median postoperative follow-up was 33.5 mo. BCR was defined as any detectable serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) ≥ 0.2 ng/mL in two consecutive measurements. BCR-free survival was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Univariate and multivariate analysis were applied to identify risk factors for PSM and BCR.  Results:   In pN0/pNx cancers, pathologic stage was pT2 in 1186 patients (71.8%), pT3 in 455 patients (27.6%), and pT4 in 11 patients (0.6%). PSM rate was 17.4% and 36.9% of pT2 and pT3 cancers, respectively. Pathologic Gleason score was < 7, = 7 and > 7 in 42.1%, 53% and 4.9% of the patients, respectively. Overall BCR-free survival was 73.1% at 5 years; the 5-year BCR-free survival was 87.9% for pT2 with negative surgical margins. PSA, Gleason score (both bioptic and pathologic), pathologic stage (pT) and surgeon's volume were significant independent predictors of PSM. PSA, pathologic Gleason score, pT and PSM were significant independent predictors of BCR-free survival. Seminal vesicle-sparing, nerve-sparing approach and the extent of nerve-sparing (intra vs interfascial dissection) did not negatively affect margin status or BCR rates.  Conclusions:   PSMs are a predictor of BCR. Being the only modifiable factor influencing the PSM rate, surgical experience is confirmed as a key factor for high-quality oncologic outcomes.""","""['Anastasios D Asimakopoulos', 'Filippo Annino', 'Camille Mugnier', 'Laurent Lopez', 'Jean Luc Hoepffner', 'Richard Gaston', 'Thierry Piechaud']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Surg Endosc""","""['Predictive factors and oncological outcomes of persistently elevated prostate-specific antigen in patients following robot-assisted radical prostatectomy.', 'Impact of margin status at 37 months after robot assisted radical prostatectomy.', 'Risk of biochemical recurrence based on extent and location of positive surgical margins after robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy.', 'Systematic review and meta-analysis of studies reporting oncologic outcome after robot-assisted radical prostatectomy.', 'Clinicopathological Significances of Positive Surgical Resection Margin after Radical Prostatectomy for Prostatic Cancers: A Meta-Analysis.', 'Intravoxel incoherent motion predicts positive surgical margins and Gleason score upgrading after radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer.', 'Robotic-assisted versus laparoscopic radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer: the first separate systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials and non-randomised studies.', 'Long-term comparative outcome analysis of a robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy with retropubic radical prostatectomy by a single surgeon.']"""

The Joinpoint Regression Program, National Cancer Institute, USA, was used to calculate time trends of cancer mortality. There were 34,214 deaths from cancer, excluding nonmelanoma skin cancer, in Sergipe. The overall cancer mortality ASR was 70.1 and 57.9 per 100,000 men and women, respectively. For the last five years, the leading causes of cancer deaths were prostate (21.3), trachea, bronchus and lung (11.7), stomach (6.5), oral cavity (5.4) and liver and intrahepatic bile ducts (5.1) in males and breast (13.8), trachea, bronchus and lung (6.6), cervix (6.4), colon/rectum (5.8) and central nervous system (3.6) in females. In addition, there was a significant reduction in deaths from ill-defined causes in the series.

We evaluate sixteen pipelines for reconstructing the evolutionary histories of 293 localized prostate cancers from single samples, and eighteen pipelines for the reconstruction of 10 tumours with multi-region sampling. We show that predictions of subclonal architecture and timing of somatic mutations vary extensively across pipelines. Pipelines show consistent types of biases, with those incorporating SomaticSniper and Battenberg preferentially predicting homogenous cancer cell populations and those using MuTect tending to predict multiple populations of cancer cells. Subclonal reconstructions using multi-region sampling confirm that single-sample reconstructions systematically underestimate intra-tumoural heterogeneity, predicting on average fewer than half of the cancer cell populations identified by multi-region sequencing.

However, its lack of specificity to differentiate PCa from benign prostate disorders stimulates the search for alternative cancer biomarkers to improve the clinical management of the patients. Different studies have described changes in the core-fucosylation level of PSA between PCa patients and healthy controls. To exploit these findings, we have adapted an impedimetric aptamer-based sensor to the dual recognition of PSA. Two different aptamers, PSAG-1 and anti-PSA, are immobilized onto two adjacent nanostructured gold electrodes. The direct binding from diluted serum samples of specific glycosylated-PSA to the first sensor and total PSA to the second one leads to changes in the charge transfer resistance, which correlate to the amount of glycosylated and total PSA in the sample. The sensors are able to measure PSA in serum with a dynamic range between 0.26 and 62.5 ng/mL (PSAG-1) and from 0.64 to 62.5 ng/mL (anti-PSA), with a reproducibility of 5.4 %. The final output of the proposed platform is the ratio between PSAG-1 reactive PSA and total PSA, defined as the glycan score. The glycan score was tested in serum samples from patients with different pathologies, showing excellent correlation between the measured score and the known diagnosis of the patients. Hence this dual aptamer-based impedimetric biosensor could be used as a minimally invasive method for the diagnosis of prostate cancer.""","""['Ana Díaz-Fernández', 'Rebeca Miranda-Castro', 'Noemí de-Los-Santos-Álvarez', 'María Jesús Lobo-Castañón', 'Pedro Estrela']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Biosens Bioelectron""","""['Electrochemical aptamer-based biosensor developed to monitor PSA and VEGF released by prostate cancer cells.', 'Focusing aptamer selection on the glycan structure of prostate-specific antigen: Toward more specific detection of prostate cancer.', 'An Automated Micro-Total Immunoassay System for Measuring Cancer-Associated α2,3-linked Sialyl N-Glycan-Carrying Prostate-Specific Antigen May Improve the Accuracy of Prostate Cancer Diagnosis.', 'Glycosylated biomarker sensors: advancements in prostate cancer diagnosis.', 'Tumor-associated forms of prostate specific antigen improve the discrimination of prostate cancer from benign disease.', 'Recent Trends in Biosensing and Diagnostic Methods for Novel Cancer Biomarkers.', 'MiR-124-3p inhibits tumor progression in prostate cancer by targeting EZH2.', 'Gold Nanoparticles-MWCNT Based Aptasensor for Early Diagnosis of Prostate Cancer.', 'Tuning iron spin states in single-atom nanozymes enables efficient peroxidase mimicking.', 'First bioelectronic immunoplatform for quantitative secretomic analysis of total and metastasis-driven glycosylated haptoglobin.']"""

The aim of this study was to investigate if differential glycosylation patterns could distinguish between indolent, significant, and aggressive PCa. Whole serum N-glycan profiling was carried out on 117 prostate cancer patients' serum using our automated, high-throughput analysis platform for glycan-profiling which utilizes ultra-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) to obtain high resolution separation of N-linked glycans released from the serum glycoproteins. We observed increases in hybrid, oligomannose, and biantennary digalactosylated monosialylated glycans (M5A1G1S1, M8, and A2G2S1), bisecting glycans (A2B, A2(6)BG1) and monoantennary glycans (A1), and decreases in triantennary trigalactosylated trisialylated glycans with and without core fucose (A3G3S3 and FA3G3S3) with PCa progression from indolent through significant and aggressive disease. These changes give us an insight into the disease pathogenesis and identify potential biomarkers for monitoring the PCa progression, however these need further confirmation studies.""","""['Sarah Gilgunn', 'Keefe Murphy', 'Henning Stöckmann', 'Paul J Conroy', 'T Brendan Murphy', 'R William Watson', ""Richard J O'Kennedy"", 'Pauline M Rudd', 'Radka Saldova']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Int J Mol Sci""","""['Core fucosylation and alpha2-3 sialylation in serum N-glycome is significantly increased in prostate cancer comparing to benign prostate hyperplasia.', 'Increased bisecting N-acetylglucosamine and decreased branched chain glycans of N-linked glycoproteins in expressed prostatic secretions associated with prostate cancer progression.', 'Characterisation of the main PSA glycoforms in aggressive prostate cancer.', 'Glycosylation products in prostate diseases.', 'The role of glycans in the development and progression of prostate cancer.', 'Rewiring of the N-Glycome with prostate cancer progression and therapy resistance.', 'Glycosyltransferase-related long non-coding RNA signature predicts the prognosis of colon adenocarcinoma.', 'Glycosylation Changes in Prostate Cancer Progression.', 'Trends in oligomannosylation and α1,2-mannosidase expression in human cancers.', 'Glycosylation: Rising Potential for Prostate Cancer Evaluation.']"""

The cavitation effect induced by FUS is thereby avoided but applied for lithotripsy, support drug delivery and the induction of blood vessel destruction for cancer therapy. In this study, head and neck cancer (FaDu), glioblastoma (T98G), and prostate cancer (PC-3) cells were exposed to FUS by using an in vitro FUS system followed by single-dose X-ray radiation therapy (RT) or water bath hyperthermia (HT). Sensitization effects of short FUS shots with cavitation (FUS-Cav) or without cavitation (FUS) to RT or HT (45 °C, 30 min) were evaluated. FUS-Cav significantly increases the sensitivity of cancer cells to RT and HT by reducing long-term clonogenic survival, short-term cell metabolic activity, cell invasion, and induction of sonoporation.

We investigated the effects of betel nut arecoline on the growth of normal and cancerous prostate cells. Normal RWPE-1 prostate epithelial cells, androgen-independent PC-3 PCa cells, and androgen-dependent LNCaP PCa cells were used. Arecoline inhibited their growth in dose- and time-dependent manners. Arecoline caused RWPE-1 and PC-3 cell cycle arrest in the G2/M phase and LNCaP cell arrest in the G0/G1 phase. In RWPE-1 cells, arecoline increased the expression of cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK)-1, p21, and cyclins B1 and D3, decreased the expression of CDK2, and had no effects on CDK4 and cyclin D1 expression. In PC-3 cells, arecoline decreased CDK1, CDK2, CDK4, p21, p27, and cyclin D1 and D3 protein expression and increased cyclin B1 protein expression. In LNCaP cells, arecoline decreased CDK2, CDK4, and cyclin D1 expression; increased p21, p27, and cyclin D3 expression; had no effects on CDK1 and cyclin B1 expression.

Scarce data is available concerning the effects of abiraterone/pred (ABI) on body composition and no published data regarding enzalutamide (ENZA). Our objective was to analyse the effects of ENZA on SM/SCF and to compare the results with ABI in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate-cancer (mCRPC).  Patients and methods:   54 patients starting ABI (n = 17) or ENZA (n = 37) at a single-centre between 2012 and 2018 were retrospectively identified. SM and SCF were assessed using CT-scans at baseline and after a median of 10.8 months on treatment. A deep learning image-segmentation software was used to quantify SM and SCF. In a subgroup of patients receiving ENZA within a trial, we investigated change of SM using serial timepoints.  Results:   Median time of treatment with ABI/ENZA was 14.6 months. A significant loss of SM compared to baseline was observed for ENZA (mean loss 5.2%, p<0.0001) and ABI (mean loss 3.0%, p = 0.02). SCF was not significantly altered. The effects of both drugs did not differ significantly. Loss of SM occurred early on during treatment with ENZA.  Conclusion:   Treatment with ENZA seems to lead to a loss of SM which is comparable to that of ABI. Further evaluation in larger patient-cohorts is warranted.

Using autopsy specimens, we analysed prostate cancer characteristics and clarified the spatial distributions of lesions.  Method:   We obtained prostate specimens from Chinese donors without a prostate cancer diagnosis and analyzed prostate cancer pathological characteristics on autopsy by whole-mount sampling. We determined the distributions of lesions in horizontal and vertical dimensions. The horizontal dimension included four horizontal quadrants (left-anterior, left-posterior, right-anterior, and right-posterior quadrants), the peripheral zone, and the transition zone.  Result:   The overall positive rate of prostate cancer among 113 specimens was 35.4%. There were 73 lesions in 40 prostates with prostate cancer. The positive rates of lesions in the left-anterior, left-posterior, right-anterior, and right-posterior quadrants were 24.7% (18/73), 27.4% (20/73), 26.0% (19/73), and 21.9% (16/73), respectively. The positive rate of prostate cancer was 74% in the areas between the apex above 0.5-0.8 cm and the middle slice.

Materials and methods:   Prostate cancer and neuroendocrine tumor (NET) patients referred to therapy with 177Lu-PSMA and 177Lu-DOTATATE, respectively, were enrolled in this study. The patients divided into the control group underwent routine RNT without any intervention and the intervention group was asked to take effervescent tablets (500 mg) of vitamin C for two days prior to the RNT (three tablets per day). To measure oxidative stress, blood samples were taken immediately before treatment and 48 h after treatment, and the serums were separated and frozen. To evaluate oxidative stress, the serum levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) and glutathione (GSH) and the activity of glutathione reductase were measured before and two days after treatment.  Results:   In total, 61 RNT cycles were evaluated in 34 patients with age of 65 ± 2.83 (median ± SE) years (range of 27-99); this total included 20 (59%) prostate cancer patients [35 cycles (57.4%)] and 14 patients (41%) with NET [26 cycles (42.6%)]. Of the 61 evaluated cycles, 27 cycles were given in the control group and 34 cycles were given in the intervention group. The serum level of MDA was significantly increased after treatment compared to before treatment (P = 0.02) in the control group, while no significant change in the serum level of MDA was observed in the intervention group (P = 0.52). The serum level of GSH was insignificantly decreased after treatment compared to before treatment in the control group and slightly increased after treatment in the intervention group (P > 0.05). The serum level of glutathione reductase was insignificantly increased in all groups of patients after treatment (P > 0.05).  Conclusion:   According to the results of this study, RNT with Lu-PSMA and Lu-DOTATATE may induce oxidative stress via the generation of free radicals and reactive oxygen species. Consumption of vitamin C prior to RNT may ameliorate this oxidative stress. These preliminary results have positive implications for clinical practice.

In this study, we assessed the construct validity of a novel application of global assessment to measure NaF uptake in the femoral neck as a method of evaluating physiologic changes in osteoblastic metabolism with age.  Methods:   Whole-body NaF-PET/computed tomography (CT) images and MRI of 24 male patients with a history of nonmetastatic prostate cancer between the ages of 36 and 82 years (67.8 ± 9.6) were analyzed. A region of interest delineated the entire femoral neck on the PET/CT image to determine the mean standardized uptake value (SUVmean). Correction for the partial volume effect was performed by measuring the volume of inert yellow bone marrow by MRI segmentation. Multiple linear regression was used to assess the relationship of uptake with age and body weight.  Results:   The SUVmean with and without partial volume correction decreased with respect to age (P = 0.001 and P = 0.002, respectively). Body weight was not significantly related to any measured PET parameter.  Conclusion:   Our results support the use of global NaF uptake with magnetic resonance-derived partial volume correction in the femoral neck. Because osteoblastic metabolism is known to decrease with normal aging, the observed decrease in NaF uptake constitutes evidence for convergent validity, indicating that the proposed methodology likely reflects systemic osteoblastic activity.

No statistically significant differences were observed in PCa-specific recurrence/progression between the younger and older patients, including after adjustment for clinical stage, PSA level, and Grade Group.  Conclusions:   In this study, the clinicopathological and molecular features of PCa diagnosed in young patients were comparable to those of PCa diagnosed in patients of screening age.

X-ray fluorescence (XRF) is considered as one of the most common methods in studying the concentration of elements in tissues and also crystalline materials, using low energy X-ray. In the present study, we aimed to evaluate the concentration of the trace elements in the scalp hair sample through XRF spectroscopy using signal processing techniques as a screening tool for prostate cancer. Methods: Hair samples of 22 men (including 11 healthy and 11 patients) were analyzed. All the sample donors were Iranian men. EDXRF method was used for the measurements. Signals were analyzed, and signal features such as mean, root-mean-square (RMS), variance, and standard deviation, skewness, and energy were investigated. The Man-Whitney U test was used to compare the trace element concentrations. The analysis of variance (ANOVA) test was used to identify which extracted feature could help to identify healthy and patient people. P values ≤ 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS 16.0 software. Results: The mean±SD age was 67.8±8.7 years in the patient group and 61.4±6.9 years in the healthy group. There were statistically significant differences in the aluminum (Al, P<0.001), silicon (Si, P=0.006), and phosphorus (P, P=0.028) levels between healthy and patient groups. Skewness and variance were found to be relevant in identifying people with cancer, as signal features. Conclusion: The use of EDXRF is a feasible method to study the concentration of elements in the hair sample, and this technique may be effective in prostate cancer screening. Further study with a large sample size will be required to elucidate the efficacy of the present method in prostate cancer screening.""","""['Majid Ghanbari Birgani', 'Reza Reiazi', 'Mahdieh Afkhami Ardekani', 'Hamed Ghaffari', 'Ali Shakeri-Zadeh', 'Bahram Mofid']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Med J Islam Repub Iran""","""['Non Invasive XRF Analysis of Human Hair for Health State Determination of Breast Tissue.', 'Assessment of X-ray fluorescence capabilities for nail and hair matrices through zinc measurement in keratin reference materials.', 'Comparative study of trace elements in blood, scalp hair and nails of prostate cancer patients in relation to healthy donors.', 'Trace elements in scalp hair samples from patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis.', 'Analysis of trace elements in scalp hair of healthy people, breast cancer and hyperplasia patients with XRF method.', 'Quantitative analysis of human hairs and nails.', 'Elemental profiles in distant tissues during tumor progression.']"""

Materials & methods: Two artificial neural network (ANN) algorithms were adopted: a multilayer feed-forward network (MLFFNN) and a nonlinear autoregressive network with eXogenous inputs (NARX). Data on the incidence of the four most common tumors (breast, colorectal, lung and prostate) from 1992 to 2016 (available from National Cancer Institute online datasets) were used for training and validation, and data until 2050 were predicted. Results: The rapid decreasing trend of prostate cancer incidence started in 2010 will continue until 2018-2019; it will then slow down and reach a plateau after 2050, with several differences among ethnicities. The incidence of breast cancer will reach a plateau in 2030, whereas colorectal cancer incidence will reach a minimum value of 35 per 100,000 in 2030. As for lung cancer, the incidence will decrease from 50 per 100,000 (2017) to 31 per 100,000 in 2030 and 26 per 100,000 in 2050.

Methods:   This is a retrospective study of patients treated from December 2016 to December 2019 in one institute. A total of 50 patients (35 men, 15 women; mean age 55.24 ± 11.03 years) with 56 osseous metastatic lesions underwent image-guided percutaneous microwave ablation. There were 7 patients with multiple and 43 patients with single metastases. The numbers of patients with primary cancer were as follows: lung, 13; liver, 17; kidney, 10; prostate, 1; breast, 3; osteosarcoma, 1; and thyroid, 5. Seventeen patients had cancer combined with soft tissue masses. The radiological images for the ablative procedures were obtained by CT, fluoroscopy with ultrasound, and fluoroscopy alone in 16, 11, and 23 patients, respectively. Pain severity was estimated using the visual analogue scale before and after treatment (1 week, 1 month, and 3 months after treatment). Radiological evaluations were performed at baseline and 3 months after the procedure.  Results:   In all patients, pain reduction occurred from the first day after treatment. Pain did not recur during the 3 months of follow up. The mean total ablation time per microwave electrode was 3.99 ± 2.48 min (range, 1-15 min). The mean power of the microwave electrode was 66.40 ± 12.08 W. The average volume of bone (load-bearing bone, such as vertebra and acetabulum) cement after ablation was 2.82 ± 0.81 mL. There were no significant differences in visual analogue scale pain scores for different imaging techniques or ablation energies. No procedure-related complications occurred.  Conclusion:   Image-guided percutaneous thermal microwave ablation of osseous metastases relieves pain and improves mobility. CT remains the first choice for percutaneous ablation. Fluoroscopy combined with ultrasound is effective for cases with soft tissue masses; fluoroscopy is also suitable for combination with vertebroplasty.

The aim of this study was to assess whether selective inhibition of integrin α2β1 is an effective strategy to target metastatic prostate cancer cells. In this regard, we examined the effects of the inhibitor BTT-3033, which selectively interferes with the connection between integrin a2b1 and its ligand, on migration, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, and specific intracellular signaling pathways using LNcap-FGC and DU-145 prostate cancer cell lines. Western blot analysis and immunocytochemistry assays showed that inhibition of integrin a2b1 inhibits EMT, through the increased expression of E-cadherin and decreased expression of N-cadherin and vimentin. Scratch wound healing assays revealed a direct effect on integrin α2β1 in the migration capacity of cells. In addition, treatment with BTT-3033 induced a reduction in cell viability and proliferation, as assessed by MTT and BrdU assays. In addition, the results show that BTT-3033 inhibits cell proliferation by inducing G1 cell cycle arrest. Moreover, inhibition of integrin α2β1 induces apoptosis through the activation of ROS, Bax protein upregulation, caspase-3 activation, and depletion of ΔΨm. Molecular signaling studies showed that integrin α2β1 was a positive regulator of MKK7 phosphorylation. In conclusion, our results reveal a critical role for integrin a2b1 in the proliferation of prostate cancer cells, as demonstrated by EMT inhibition, cell cycle arrest, and apoptosis induction in response to treatment with its specific inhibitor BT-3033.""","""['Zahra Salemi', 'Reza Azizi', 'Faranak Fallahian', 'Mahmoud Aghaei']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""J Cell Physiol""","""['Inhibition of didscoidin domain receptor 1 reduces epithelial-mesenchymal transition and induce cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis in prostate cancer cell lines.', 'Down-Regulation of DDR1 Induces Apoptosis and Inhibits EMT through Phosphorylation of Pyk2/MKK7 in DU-145 and Lncap-FGC Prostate Cancer Cell Lines.', 'Metformin inhibits epithelial-mesenchymal transition in prostate cancer cells: involvement of the tumor suppressor miR30a and its target gene SOX4.', 'RGD cadherins and α2β1 integrin in cancer metastasis: A dangerous liaison.', 'Alpha2beta1 integrin in cancer development and chemoresistance.', 'The Emerging Role of Cell Adhesion Molecules on Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia.', 'Alpha2beta1 Integrin Polymorphism in Diffuse Astrocytoma Patients.', 'Construction of a prognostic risk assessment model for lung adenocarcinoma based on Integrin β family-related genes.', 'Comprehensive Analysis of Cell Cycle-Related Genes in Patients With Prostate Cancer.', 'Phosphoproteomics identifies potential downstream targets of the integrin α2β1 inhibitor BTT-3033 in prostate stromal cells.']"""

Here we describe molecular characterization and drug testing in a panel of 20 prostate cancer cell lines. The cell lines cluster into distinct subsets based on RNA expression, which is largely driven by functional Androgen Receptor (AR) expression. KLK3, the AR-responsive gene that encodes prostate specific antigen, shows the greatest variability in expression across the cell line panel. Other common prostate cancer associated genes such as TMPRSS2 and ERG show similar expression patterns. Copy number analysis demonstrates that many of the most commonly gained (including regions containing TERC and MYC) and lost regions (including regions containing TP53 and PTEN) that were identified in patient samples by the TCGA are mirrored in the prostate cancer cell lines. Assessment of response to the anti-androgen enzalutamide shows a distinct separation of responders and non-responders, predominantly related to status of wild-type AR. Surprisingly, several AR-null lines responded to enzalutamide. These AR-null, enzalutamide-responsive cells were characterized by high levels of expression of glucocorticoid receptor (GR) encoded by NR3C1. Treatment of these cells with the anti-GR agent mifepristone showed that they were more sensitive to this drug than enzalutamide, as were several of the enzalutamide non-responsive lines. This is consistent with several recent reports that suggest that GR expression is an alternative signaling mechanism that can bypass AR blockade. This study reinforces the utility of large cell line panels for the study of cancer and identifies several cell lines that represent ideal models to study AR-null cells that have upregulated GR to sustain growth.""","""['Rebecca Smith', 'Moqing Liu', 'Tiera Liby', 'Nora Bayani', 'Elmar Bucher', 'Kami Chiotti', 'Daniel Derrick', 'Anne Chauchereau', 'Laura Heiser', 'Joshi Alumkal', 'Heidi Feiler', 'Peter Carroll', 'James E Korkola']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Sci Rep""","""['Glucocorticoid receptor activity contributes to resistance to androgen-targeted therapy in prostate cancer.', 'The Glucocorticoid Receptor Is a Key Player for Prostate Cancer Cell Survival and a Target for Improved Antiandrogen Therapy.', 'TLE3 loss confers AR inhibitor resistance by facilitating GR-mediated human prostate cancer cell growth.', 'Darolutamide as a Second-Generation Androgen Receptor Inhibitor in the Treatment of Prostate Cancer.', 'Is the glucocorticoid receptor a key player in prostate cancer?: A literature review.', 'A GATA2-CDC6 axis modulates androgen receptor blockade-induced senescence in prostate cancer.', 'Glucocorticoid Receptor and β-Catenin Interact in Prostate Cancer Cells and Their Co-Inhibition Attenuates Tumorsphere Formation, Stemness, and Docetaxel Resistance.', 'Preclinical Efficacy of a PARP-1 Targeted Auger-Emitting Radionuclide in Prostate Cancer.', 'CTPC, a combined transcriptome data set of human prostate cancer cell lines.', 'Targeted non AR mediated smart delivery of abiraterone to the prostate cancer.']"""

To achieve this, we performed cell-free DNA quantification and characterization assays, evaluation of gene and miRNA expression profiling focused on cancer progression and EMT, and metabolomics by mass spectrometry and cellular migration. The results showed that tumor-free cell DNA was able to alter the gene expression of MMP9 and CD44, alter the expression profile of nine miRNAs, and increased the tryptophan consumption and cell migration rates in non-tumor cells.

The dearth of expert pathologists, the inter- and intraobserver variability, as well as the labour intensity of Gleason grading all necessitate the development of a user-friendly tool for robust standardisation.  Objective:   To develop an artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm, based on machine learning and convolutional neural networks, as a tool for improved standardisation in Gleason grading in prostate cancer biopsies.  Design, setting, and participants:   A total of 698 prostate biopsy sections from 174 patients were used for training. The training sections were annotated by two senior consultant pathologists. The final algorithm was tested on 37 biopsy sections from 21 patients, with digitised slide images from two different scanners.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Correlation, sensitivity, and specificity parameters were calculated.  Results and limitations:   The algorithm shows high accuracy in detecting cancer areas (sensitivity: 100%, specificity: 68%). Compared with the pathologists, the algorithm also performed well in detecting cancer areas (intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC]: 0.99) and assigning the Gleason patterns correctly: Gleason patterns 3 and 4 (ICC: 0.96 and 0.94, respectively), and to a lesser extent, Gleason pattern 5 (ICC: 0.82). Similar results were obtained using two different scanners.  Conclusions:   Our AI-based algorithm can reliably detect prostate cancer and quantify the Gleason patterns in core needle biopsies, with similar accuracy as pathologists. The results are reproducible on images from different scanners with a proven low level of intraobserver variability. We believe that this AI tool could be regarded as an efficient and interactive tool for pathologists.

Aim:   The goal of this study is to analyze the ability of 3 different pharmacological strategies to preserve the ability of men to achieve spontaneous (non-medication assisted) erections after bilateral nerve-sparing RP.  Methods:   This IRB- and FDA-approved study studied penile rehabilitation in a 3-arm fashion with a target enrollment of 200 patients. (i) Control arm: nightly placebo with sildenafil 100 mg on demand for sexual relations (up to 6 pills/month); (ii) nightly sildenafil arm: nightly sildenafil 50 mg and sildenafil 100 mg on demand for sexual relations (up to 6 pills/month); (iii) combination therapy arm: nightly sildenafil 50 mg (5 nights/week) plus intracavernosal injections twice/week. Inclusion criteria included bilateral nerve-sparing surgery, normal serum total testosterone, and good preoperative baseline erectile function as measured by the erectile function domain score of the IIEF (EFD) (≥24). Patients were followed with a medication use diary and the IIEF questionnaire at 6 weeks, 3 m, 6 m, 12 m, 18 m and 24 m.  Outcomes:   A difference was seen in the IIEF-EFD scores between the 3 groups at 24 months after RP. Secondary end points include the time to return of spontaneous functional erections, the time for patients to respond to oral erectogenic therapy, and the proportion of patients who have normalization of their IIEF-EFD scores.  Results:   The study was interrupted because of failure to recruit the target study population in a reasonable timeframe. A total of 76 subjects with median age of 57 (IQR: 51, 63) years and mean IIEF-EFD of 29 (IQR: 27, 30) were initially randomized, but at 24 months, the sample sizes by group were (i) n = 4; (ii) n = 18; and (iii) n = 10, with median IIEF-EFD 24 (IQR: 18, 28), 24 (IQR: 18, 28), and 21 (IQR: 9, 26), respectively. There was no statistical difference among the groups in the final analysis.  Clinical implications:   Definitive evidence for the ability of different pharmacological rehabilitation strategies to improve long-term EF outcomes might never be available.  Strengths & limitations:   This was a well-designed randomized and 3-arm designed trial intended to provide decisive evidence regarding the utility of penile rehabilitation. Failure to recruit the target population is the main limitation.  Conclusion:   The limited number of patients in the present trial precludes definitive interpretation.

Here, we assess whether transcriptomic interactions between tumor immune content score (ICS) and the Decipher genomic classifier can identify most lethal subsets of GG-45 PCa. We utilized whole transcriptome data from 8071 tumor tissue (6071 prostatectomy and 2000 treatment-naïve biopsy samples) to derive four immunogenomic subtypes using ICS and Decipher. When compared across all grade groups, GG-45 samples had the highest proportion of most aggressive subtype-ICSHigh/DecipherHigh. Subsequent analyses within the GG-45 patient samples (n = 1420) revealed that the ICSHigh/DecipherHigh subtype was associated with increased genomic radiosensitivity. Additionally, in a multivariable model (n = 335), ICSHigh/DecipherHigh subtype had a significantly higher risk of distant metastasis (hazard ratio [HR] = 5.41; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.76-10.6; p ≤ 0.0001) and PCa-specific mortality (HR = 10.6; 95% CI, 4.18-26.94; p ≤ 0.0001) as compared with ICSLow/DecipherLow. The novel immunogenomic subtypes establish a very strong synergistic interaction between ICS and Decipher in identifying GG-45 patients who experience the most lethal outcomes. PATIENT SUMMARY: In this analysis, we identified a novel interaction between the total immune content of prostate tumors and genomic classifier to identify the most lethal subset of patients with grade groups 4 and 5.

Ethnomedically used plant parts, were examined in this study against human prostate cancer cells for the first time and mechanisms of action elucidated for the most potent of them, along with the active phytochemical, annonacin.  Methods:   Nine extracts of varying polarity from the leaves and bark of A. muricata were assessed initially for cytotoxicity using the MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay on PC-3 prostate cancer cells and the ethyl acetate bark (EAB) extract was identified as the most potent. EAB extract was then standardized for annonacin content using High-performance Liquid Chromatography - Mass Spectrometry (HPLC-MS) and shown to be effective against a second prostate cancer cell line (DU-145) also. The mode of cell death in DU-145 cells were assessed via several apoptotic assays including induction of increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, reduction of mitochondrial membrane potential, activation of caspases and annexin V externalization combined with morphological observations using confocal microscopy. In addition, the potential to prevent metastasis was examined via inhibition of cell migration, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and angiogenesis using the chorioallantoic membrane assay (CAM).  Results:   Annonacin and EAB extract displayed selective and potent cytotoxicity against the DU-145 prostate carcinoma cells with IC50 values of 0.1 ± 0.07 μM and 55.501 ± 0.55 μg/mL respectively, without impacting RWPE-1 normal prostate cells, in stark contrast to chemotherapeutic docetaxel which lacked such selectivity. Docetaxel's impact on the cancerous DU-145 was improved by 50% when used in combination with EAB extract. Insignificant levels of intracellular ROS content, depolarization of mitochondrial membrane, Caspase 3/7 activation, annexin V content, along with stained morphological evaluations, pointed to a non-apoptotic mode of cell death. The extract at 50 μg/mL deterred cell migration in the wound-healing assay, while inhibition of angiogenesis was displayed in the CAM and VEGF inhibition assays for both EAB (100 μg /mL) and annonacin (0.5 μM).

Importantly, expression is restricted in normal tissue, making it an ideal tumor targeting antigen. Since there is clinical and preclinical evidence of the efficacy of Bispecific T cell Engager (BiTE) therapy in PCa, we sought to produce and test the efficacy of a GPC-1 targeted BiTE construct based on the Miltuximab® sequence. Miltuximab® is a clinical stage anti-GPC-1 antibody that has proven safe in first in human trials.  Methods:   The single chain variable fragment (scFv) of Miltuximab® and the CD3 binding sequence of Blinatumomab were combined in a standard BiTE format. Binding of the construct to immobilised recombinant CD3 and GPC-1 antigens was assessed by ELISA and BiaCore, and binding to cell surface-expressed antigens was measured by flow cytometry. The ability of MIL-38-CD3 to activate T cells was assessed using in vitro co-culture assays with tumour cell lines of varying GPC-1 expression by measurement of CD69 and CD25 expression, before cytolytic activity was assessed in a similar co-culture. The release of inflammatory cytokines from T cells was measured by ELISA and expression of PD-1 on the T cell surface was measured by flow cytometry.  Results:   Binding activity of MIL-38-CD3 to both cell surface-expressed and immobilised recombinant GPC-1 and CD3 was retained. MIL-38-CD3 was able to mediate the activation of peripheral blood T cells from healthy individuals, resulting in the release of inflammatory cytokines TNF and IFN-g. Activation was reliant on GPC-1 expression as MIL-38-CD3 mediated only low level T cell activation in the presence of C3 cells (constitutively low GPC-1 expression). Activated T cells were redirected to lyse PCa cell lines PC3 and DU-145 (GPC-1 moderate or high expression, respectively) but could not kill GPC-1 negative Raji cells. The expression of PD-1 was up-regulated on the surface of MIL-38-CD3 activated T cells, suggesting potential for synergy with checkpoint inhibition.  Conclusions:   This study reports preclinical findings into the efficacy of targeting GPC-1 in PCa with BiTE construct MIL-38-CD3. We show the specificity and efficacy of the construct, supporting its further preclinical development.""","""['Maria E Lund', 'Christopher B Howard', 'Kristofer J Thurecht', 'Douglas H Campbell', 'Stephen M Mahler', 'Bradley J Walsh']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""BMC Cancer""","""['A tetravalent bispecific TandAb (CD19/CD3), AFM11, efficiently recruits T cells for the potent lysis of CD19(+) tumor cells.', 'Effective targeting of prostate cancer by lymphocytes redirected by a PSMA\u2009×\u2009CD3 bispecific single-chain diabody.', 'Solitomab, an EpCAM/CD3 bispecific antibody construct (BiTE), is highly active against primary uterine serous papillary carcinoma cell lines in\xa0vitro.', 'Utilizing the BiTE (bispecific T-cell engager) platform for immunotherapy of cancer.', 'Unleashing the clinical power of T cells: CD19/CD3 bi-specific T cell engager (BiTE®) antibody construct blinatumomab as a potential therapy.', 'The IgG4 hinge with CD28 transmembrane domain improves VHH-based CAR T cells targeting a membrane-distal epitope of GPC1 in pancreatic cancer.', 'Attenuation of cancer proliferation by suppression of glypican-1 and its pleiotropic effects in neoplastic behavior.', 'Metastatic Prostate Cancer-A Review of Current Treatment Options and Promising New Approaches.', 'Immunotherapy in Advanced Prostate Cancer-Light at the End of the Tunnel?', 'T Cell Bispecific Antibodies: An Antibody-Based Delivery System for Inducing Antitumor Immunity.']"""

A barrier to incorporating the full data is a lack of solid recommendations for variable selection, with researchers often hand-selecting a few variables. Thus, we evaluated the ability of empirical machine learning approaches to identify social-environmental factors having a true association with a health outcome.  Methods:   We compared several popular machine learning methods, including penalized regressions (e.g. lasso, elastic net), and tree ensemble methods. Via simulation, we assessed the methods' ability to identify census variables truly associated with binary and continuous outcomes while minimizing false positive results (10 true associations, 1000 total variables). We applied the most promising method to the full census data (p = 14,663 variables) linked to prostate cancer registry data (n = 76,186 cases) to identify social-environmental factors associated with advanced prostate cancer.  Results:   In simulations, we found that elastic net identified many true-positive variables, while lasso provided good control of false positives. Using a combined measure of accuracy, hierarchical clustering based on Spearman's correlation with sparse group lasso regression performed the best overall. Bayesian Adaptive Regression Trees outperformed other tree ensemble methods, but not the sparse group lasso. In the full dataset, the sparse group lasso successfully identified a subset of variables, three of which replicated earlier findings.  Conclusions:   This analysis demonstrated the potential of empirical machine learning approaches to identify a small subset of census variables having a true association with the outcome, and that replicate across empiric methods. Sparse clustered regression models performed best, as they identified many true positive variables while controlling false positive discoveries.""","""['Elizabeth Handorf', 'Yinuo Yin', 'Michael Slifker', 'Shannon Lynch']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""BMC Med Res Methodol""","""['Instability of Variable-selection Algorithms Used to Identify True Predictors of an Outcome in Intermediate-dimension Epidemiologic Studies.', 'Variable selection with missing data in both covariates and outcomes: Imputation and machine learning.', 'Part 1.

The correlation between DQA results and treatment planning parameters were analyzed using logistic regression analysis. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, areas under the curves (AUCs), and the Classification and Regression Tree (CART) algorithm were used to analyze treatment planning parameters as possible predictors for DQA failure.  Results:   The AUC for leaf open time (LOT) was 0.70, and its cut-off point was approximately 30%. The ROC curve for the predicted probability calculated when the multivariate variable model was applied showed an AUC of 0.815. We confirmed that total monitor units, total dose, and LOT were significant predictors for DQA failure using the CART.  Conclusions:   The probability of DQA failure was higher when the percentage of LOT below 100 ms was higher than 30%.

We previously reported that acute intereluekin-1 (IL-1) exposure represses androgen receptor (AR) accumulation and activity, providing a possible mechanism for IL-1-mediated development of androgen- and AR-independent PCa. Given that acute inflammation is quickly resolved, and chronic inflammation is, instead, co-opted by cancer cells to promote tumorigenicity, we set out to determine if chronic IL-1 exposure leads to similar repression of AR and AR activity observed for acute IL-1 exposure and to determine if chronic IL-1 exposure selects for androgen- and AR-independent PCa cells. We generated isogenic sublines from LNCaP cells chronically exposed to IL-1α or IL-1β. Cells were treated with IL-1α, IL-1β, TNFα or HS-5 bone marrow stromal cells conditioned medium to assess cell viability in the presence of cytotoxic inflammatory cytokines. Cell viability was also assessed following serum starvation, AR siRNA silencing and enzalutamide treatment. Finally, RNA sequencing was performed for the IL-1 sublines. MTT, RT-qPCR and western blot analysis show that the sublines evolved resistance to inflammation-induced cytotoxicity and intracellular signaling and evolved reduced sensitivity to siRNA-mediated loss of AR, serum deprivation and enzalutamide. Differential gene expression reveals that canonical AR signaling is aberrant in the IL-1 sublines, where the cells show constitutive PSA repression and basally high KLK2 and NKX3.1 mRNA levels and bioinformatics analysis predicts that pro-survival and pro-tumorigenic pathways are activated in the sublines.

This knowledge could improve the classification of patients for different methods of treatment and enable better recognition of groups with higher risk of biological recurrence. We prospectively assessed serial blood levels of apoptotic biomarkers and correlated them with response to treatment and clinical factors. MATERIAL AND METHODS Blood was collected from 25 patients with prostate cancer before and after surgery, 16 healthy volunteers with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), and 14 patients with metastasized disease. Immunoenzymatic methods were used to determine circulating apoptotic and inflammatory mediators, including tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), type I receptor (TNFRI), and type II receptor (TNFRII); FAS ligand (FasL); TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRIAL); caspase 8 (Cas8); caspase 9 (Cas9); DNA methylation (metDNA); P-selectin; and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein. The total circulating fragments of cell-free DNA (cfDNA) were measured directly in serum. RESULTS Peripheral serum prostate-specific antigen increased rapidly together with cfDNA. A negative correlation was noted between tumor volume and TNFRI and TNFRII. Postsurgery P-selectin level was decreased, and metDNA and TNFRII levels were increased. Three comparisons were made between patient groups: surgical vs. BPH; surgical vs. palliative; and palliative vs. BPH. TNFRI, TNFRII, metDNA, P-selectin, Cas8, and FasL were shown to have significant roles.

Patients received up to ten 21-day cycles of docetaxel (75 mg/m2 intravenous, day 1) and prednisolone (5 mg twice daily, oral, day 1-21) and were randomly assigned (1:1) to oral capivasertib (320 mg twice daily, 4 days on/3 days off, from day 2 each cycle), or placebo, until disease progression. Treatment allocation used minimization factors: bone metastases; visceral metastases; investigational site; and prior abiraterone or enzalutamide. The primary objective, by intention to treat, determined if the addition of capivasertib prolonged a composite progression-free survival (cPFS) end point that included prostate-specific antigen progression events. cPFS and overall survival (OS) were also assessed by composite biomarker subgroup for PI3K/AKT/PTEN pathway activation status.  Results:   One hundred and fifty patients were enrolled. Median cPFS was 7.03 (95% CI, 6.28 to 8.25) and 6.70 months (95% CI, 5.52 to 7.36) with capivasertib and placebo respectively (hazard ratio [HR], 0.92; 80% CI, 0.73 to 1.16; one-sided P = .32). Median OS was 31.15 (95% CI, 20.07 to not reached) and 20.27 months (95% CI, 17.51 to 24.18), respectively (HR, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.34 to 0.88; two-sided P = .01). cPFS and OS results were consistent irrespective of PI3K/AKT/PTEN pathway activation status. Grade III-IV adverse events were equivalent between arms (62.2%). The most common adverse events of any grade deemed related to capivasertib were diarrhea, fatigue, nausea, and rash.  Conclusion:   The addition of capivasertib to chemotherapy did not extend cPFS in mCRPC irrespective of PI3K/AKT/PTEN pathway activation status. The observed OS result (a secondary end point) will require prospective validation in future studies to address potential for bias.""","""['Simon J Crabb', 'Gareth Griffiths', 'Ellice Marwood', 'Denise Dunkley', 'Nichola Downs', 'Karen Martin', 'Michelle Light', 'Josh Northey', 'Sam Wilding', 'Amy Whitehead', 'Emily Shaw', 'Alison J Birtle', 'Amit Bahl', 'Tony Elliott', 'Charlotte Westbury', 'Santhanam Sundar', 'Angus Robinson', 'Satinder Jagdev', 'Satish Kumar', 'Claire Rooney', 'Carolina Salinas-Souza', 'Christine Stephens', 'Vincent Khoo', 'Robert J Jones']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""J Clin Oncol""","""['Overall Survival Update for Patients with Metastatic Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer Treated with Capivasertib and Docetaxel in the Phase 2 ProCAID Clinical Trial.', 'Capivasertib Plus Paclitaxel Versus Placebo Plus Paclitaxel As First-Line Therapy for Metastatic Triple-Negative Breast Cancer: The PAKT Trial.', 'Fulvestrant plus capivasertib versus placebo after relapse or progression on an aromatase inhibitor in metastatic, oestrogen receptor-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer (FAKTION): overall survival, updated progression-free survival, and expanded biomarker analysis from a randomised, phase 2 trial.', 'Efficacy and safety of second-line agents for treatment of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer progressing after docetaxel.

Importantly, these methods must efficiently assess target selectivity and accurately discern noncovalent binding from the formation of resultant covalent adducts. One recently reported covalent chemical tool used in tumor immune oncology, covalent immune recruiters (CIRs), increases the proximity of immune cells and cancer cells, promoting immune recognition and response. Herein we describe biolayer interferometry (BLI) biosensor, flow cytometry, and solution fluorescence-based assay approaches to characterize CIR:antibody binding and CIR-antibody covalent-labeling kinetics. BLI technology, akin to surface plasmon resonance, provides the unique opportunity to investigate molecular binding and labeling kinetics both on a solid surface (Basic Protocol 1) and in solution (Alternate Protocol 1). Here, recruitment of mass-containing proteins to the BLI probe via CIR is measured with high sensitivity and is used as a readout of CIR labeling activity. Further, CIR technology is used to label antibodies with a fluorescent handle. In this system, labeling is monitored via SDS-PAGE with a fluorescence gel imager, where increased fluorescence intensity of a sample reflects increased labeling (Basic Protocol 2). Analysis of CIR:antibody target-specific immune activation is demonstrated with a flow cytometry-based antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP) assay (Basic Protocol 3). This ADCP protocol may be further used to discern CIR:antibody binding from covalent adduct formation (Alternate Protocol 3). For the protocols described, each method may be used to analyze characteristics of any covalent-tagging or antibody-recruiting small molecule or protein-based technology. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

Aim:   We develop and assess the feasibility of a one-hour-to-diagnosis (1Hr2Dx) method for processing and providing a preliminary diagnosis of a set of 12 prostate biopsies.  Approach:   We developed a fluorescence staining, optical clearing, and 3D open-top light-sheet microscopy workflow to enable 12 prostate needle core biopsies to be processed and diagnosed within an hour of receipt. We analyzed 44 biopsies by the 1Hr2Dx method, which does not consume tissue. The biopsies were then processed for routine, slide-based 2D histology. Three pathologists independently evaluated the 3D 1Hr2Dx and 2D slide-based datasets in a blinded, randomized fashion. Turnaround times were recorded, and the accuracy of our method was compared with gold-standard slide-based histology.  Results:   The average turnaround time for tissue processing, imaging, and diagnosis was 44.5 min. The sensitivity and specificity of 1Hr2Dx in diagnosing cancer were both >90 % .

Methods:   Patients with early metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer with confirmed prostate-specific antigen progression within 1-year or prostate-specific antigen progression without having normal prostate-specific antigen level (<4.0 ng/mL) during first-line androgen deprivation therapy were enrolled and administered abiraterone acetate (1000 mg) plus prednisolone (10 mg). A minimum of 48 patients were required according to Simon's minimax design. The primary endpoint was prostate-specific antigen response rate (≥50% prostate-specific antigen decline by 12 weeks), secondary endpoints included prostate-specific antigen progression-free survival and overall survival. Safety parameters were also assessed.  Results:   For efficacy, 49/50 patients were evaluable. Median age was 73 (range: 55-86) years. The median duration of initial androgen deprivation therapy was 32.4 (range: 13.4-84.1) weeks and 48 patients experienced prostate-specific antigen progression within 1-year after initiation of androgen deprivation therapy. prostate-specific antigen response rate was 55.1% (95% confidence interval: 40.2%-69.3%), median prostate-specific antigen-progression-free survival was 24.1 weeks, and median overall survival was 102.9 weeks (95% confidence interval: 64.86 not estimable [NE]). Most common adverse event was nasopharyngitis (15/50 patients, 30.0%). The most common ≥grade 3 adverse event was alanine aminotransferase increased (6/50 patients, 12.0%).  Conclusions:   Abiraterone acetate plus prednisolone demonstrated a high prostate-specific antigen response rate of 55.1%, suggesting tumor growth still depends on androgen synthesis in patients with early metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.

In the present study, we show that neither AR-V7 homodimerization nor AR-V7/AR-FL heterodimerization requires cofactors or DNA binding. AR-V7 can enter the nucleus as a monomer and drive a transcriptional program and DNA-damage repair as a homodimer. While forming a heterodimer with AR-FL to induce nuclear localization of unliganded AR-FL, AR-V7 does not need to interact with AR-FL to drive gene transcription or DNA-damage repair in prostate cancer cells that co-express AR-V7 and AR-FL.

The major cause of death in prostate cancer patients can be attributed to metastatic spread of disease or tumor recurrence after initial treatment. Prostate tumors are known to remain undetected or dormant for a long period of time before they progress locoregionally or at distant sites as overt tumors. However, the molecular mechanism of dormancy is yet poorly understood. In this study, we performed a differential gene expression analysis and identified a gene, Regucalcin (RGN), which promotes dormancy of prostate cancer. We found that cancer patients expressing higher level of RGN showed significantly longer recurrence-free and overall- survival. Using a doxycycline-inducible RGN expression system, we showed that ectopic expression of RGN in prostate tumor cells induced dormancy in vivo, while following suppression of RGN triggered recurrence of tumor growth. On the other hand, silencing RGN in LNCap cells promoted its outgrowth in the tibia of mice. Importantly, RGN promoted multiple known hallmarks of tumor dormancy including activation of p38 MAPK, decrease in Erk signaling and inhibition of FOXM1 expression. Furthermore, we found that RGN significantly suppressed angiogenesis by increasing secretory miR-23c level in the exosomes. Intriguingly, FOXM1 was found to negatively regulate miR-23c expression in prostate cancer. In addition, we identified 11 RGN downstream target genes that independently predicted longer recurrence-free survival in patients. We found that expression of these genes was regulated by FOXM1 and/or p38 MAPK. These findings suggest a critical role of RGN in prostate cancer dormancy, and the utility of RGN signaling and exosomal miR-23c as biomarkers for predicting recurrence.""","""['Sambad Sharma', 'Xinhong Pei', 'Fei Xing', 'Shih-Ying Wu', 'Kerui Wu', 'Abhishek Tyagi', 'Dan Zhao', 'Ravindra Deshpande', 'Marco Gabriel Ruiz', 'Ravi Singh', 'Feng Lyu', 'Kounosuke Watabe']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Oncogene""","""['Effect of extracellular calcium on regucalcin expression and cell viability in neoplastic and non-neoplastic human prostate cells.', 'Regucalcin is an androgen-target gene in the rat prostate modulating cell-cycle and apoptotic pathways.', 'Suppressed glycolytic metabolism in the prostate of transgenic rats overexpressing calcium-binding protein regucalcin underpins reduced cell proliferation.', 'Prostate cancer dormancy and recurrence.', 'The Emerging Role of Regucalcin as a Tumor Suppressor: Facts and Views.', 'Uroplakin 1a Interacts with Regucalcin and Proteasome Subunit Beta 1.', 'Autophagy modulators influence the content of important signalling molecules in PS-positive extracellular vesicles.', 'Investigating microRNA Profiles in Prostate Cancer Bone Metastases and Functional Effects of microRNA-23c and microRNA-4328.', 'RGN as a prognostic biomarker with immune infiltration and ceRNA in lung squamous cell carcinoma.', 'The genomic regulation of metastatic dormancy.']"""

Recently, paradoxical results were reported on the implication of the MEN1 gene in PCa. To dissect its role in prostate luminal cells, we generated a mouse model with inducible Men1 disruption in Nkx3.1-deficient mice in which mouse prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (mPIN) occur. Prostate glands from mutant and control mice were analyzed pathologically and molecularly; cellular and molecular analyses were carried out in PCa cell lines after MEN1 knockdown (KD) by siRNA. Double-mutant mice developed accelerated mPIN and later displayed microinvasive adenocarcinoma. Markedly, early-stage lesions exhibited a decreased expression of AR and its target genes, accompanied by reduced CK18 and E-cadherin expression, suggesting a shift from a luminal to a dedifferentiated epithelial phenotype. Intriguingly, over 60% of menin-deficient cells expressed CD44 at a later stage. Furthermore, MEN1 KD led to the increase in CD44 expression in PC3 cells re-expressing AR. Menin bound to the proximal AR promoter and regulated AR transcription via the H3K4me3 histone mark. Interestingly, the cell proliferation of AR-dependent cells (LNCaP, 22Rv1, and VCaP), but not of AR-independent cells (DU145, PC3), responded strongly to MEN1 silencing. Finally, menin expression was found reduced in some human PCa. These findings highlight the regulation of the AR promoter by menin and the crosstalk between menin and the AR pathway.

Methods:   A retrospective medical records-based cohort study, including 47 men with primary PCa who received 18F-fluciclovine PET/CT and subsequent e-PLND for lymph node staging. Incidence and number of visualized LNM, their locations and diameters on 18F-fluciclovine PET/CT were recorded in comparison to the histopathological results of the e-PLND as reference. Positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), sensitivity, specificity and diagnostic accuracy of 18F-fluciclovine PET/CT were calculated on the basis of histopathology results after e-PLND.  Results:   Forty-seven men were eligible for analysis. Median lymph node yield was 19 (range 10-70). A total of 996 lymph nodes were removed, and 59 metastases were found in 21 cases (45%). Preoperative PET was issued 'positive' in 11 men and in 9 of them (82%) this was histopathologically confirmed resulting in a PPV of 82% (95% CI, 51-96). On the contrary, PET was issued 'negative' in 36 cases, but in 12 of them (33%) metastases were detected in the e-PLND specimen, resulting in an NPV of 67% (95% CI, 50-80).

However, most of the evaluation of postoperative function has taken place at a relatively high, non-granular level. Most of the data we use to provide informed consent for our patients is obtained from retrospective series, or derived from prospective studies whose primary outcome was oncological. Finally, most studies have focused on erectile function and overlooked other, presumably important, elements of male sexual function. The present study aims at studying in-depth the sexual consequences of focal therapy with various energy sources.  Methods and analysis:   This will be a mixed-methods research study based on a retrospective and prospective cohort, recruited in parallel. The retrospective cohort will consist of patients treated with focal irreversible electroporation, and the prospective cohort of patients treated with three focal therapy energies. Participants will be recruited from two UK urology centres, one National Health Service and one private. On consent, patients will fill in self-administered validated questionnaires (International Index of Erectile Function-15 (IIEF-15), Male Sexual Health Questionnaire-Ejaculatory Dysfunction-Short Form (MSHQ-EjD-SF)) and semistructured interviews will be organised to collect patients' expectations and postoperative changes in domains such as erection, ejaculation, orgasm, libido/sexual desire, masculinity/virility, penile morphology, pain or discomfort, regret, shame, cancer-related stress, overall impact and partner satisfaction. An exploratory thematic analysis will be performed to detail recurring themes that will be grouped into clusters of experiences. We will then be able to find clusters of agreement and disagreement that will be illustrated using exemplar patient quotations.  Ethics and dissemination:   Ethical approval was obtained (Regional Ethics Committee reference 20/NW/0335), as well as Health Research Authority approval. Results will be published in open-access peer-reviewed journals. Findings will also be translated into patient information resources (leaflets, online information sheets).

The oncogenic MUC1-C protein promotes lineage plasticity in the progression of neuroendocrine prostate cancer (NEPC), however, there is no known association between MUC1-C and BAF. We report here that MUC1-C binds directly to the E2F1 transcription factor and that the MUC1-C→E2F1 pathway induces expression of embryonic stem cell-specific BAF (esBAF) components BRG1, ARID1A, BAF60a, BAF155, and BAF170 in castrate-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) and NEPC cells. In concert with this previously unrecognized pathway, MUC1 was associated with increased expression of E2F1 and esBAF components in NEPC tumors as compared with CRPC, supporting involvement of MUC1-C in activating the E2F1→esBAF pathway with progression to NEPC. MUC1-C formed a nuclear complex with BAF and activated cancer stem cell (CSC) gene signatures and the core pluripotency factor gene network. The MUC1-C→E2F1→BAF pathway was necessary for induction of both the NOTCH1 effector of CSC function and the NANOG pluripotency factor, and collectively, this network drove CSC self-renewal. These findings indicate that MUC1-C promotes NEPC progression by integrating activation of E2F1 and esBAF with induction of NOTCH1, NANOG, and stemness.

We showed that miRNA Let-7b was highly expressed in noncancerous cells and strongly decreased in cancerous PC3 cells, while the opposite was observed in the respective EVs, thus supporting the tumor suppressor role of miRNA Let7-b. We also demonstrated that miRNA Let-7b can be transferred to THP-1 cells via EVs, which are known to induce TAM-like polarization. Our results support the view that miRNA Let-7 b, contained in PC3-derived EVs, is associated with the increase in the miRNA Let7-b observed in TAM-like macrophages.

In bladder urothelial carcinoma (UC), particularly, L1s become DNA-hypomethylated, expressed and contribute to genomic instability and tumor growth. It is, however, unknown which individual L1s are activated. Following RNA-immunoprecipitation with a L1-specific antibody, third generation nanopore sequencing detected transcripts of 90 individual elements in the VM-Cub-1 UC line with high overall L1 expression. In total, 10 L1s accounted for >60% of the reads. Analysis of five specific L1s by RT-qPCR revealed generally increased expression in UC tissues and cell lines over normal controls, but variable expression among tumor cell lines from bladder, prostate and testicular cancer. Chromatin immunoprecipitation demonstrated active histone marks at L1 sequences with increased expression in VM-Cub-1, but not in a different UC cell line with low L1 expression. We conclude that many L1 elements are epigenetically activated in bladder cancer in a varied pattern.

Methods:   We compared tumors collected from two syngeneic mouse models and isolated tumor-infiltrating leukocytes (TILs) with different cluster of differentiation 11b (CD11b) statuses. We examined the proliferation functions of the TILs and the IL1RN using several approaches, including a colony-formation assay and DNA synthesis levels.  Results:   We demonstrated that CD11b-deficient TILs (TILs/CD11b-) secreted the IL1RN and promoted proliferation by analyzing conditioned media. In addition to mouse TRAMP-C1, proliferation functions of the IL1RN were confirmed in several human castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) cell lines and one normal epithelial cell line. The androgen-sensitive lymph node carcinoma of the prostate (LNCaP) cell line showed cytotoxic responses to IL1β treatment and androgen-dependent regulation of IL-1 receptor type 1 (IL1R1), while the C4-2 CRPC cell line did not. IL1RN rescued LNCaP cells from the cytotoxic effects of IL1β/IL1R1 signaling.

PAK-1 activity is inhibited by the small molecule ""Inhibitor targeting PAK-1 activation-3"" (IPA-3), which has selectivity for PAK-1 but is metabolically unstable. Secretory Group IIA phospholipase A2 (sPLA2) expression correlates to increased metastasis and decreased survival in many cancers. We previously designed novel liposomal formulations targeting both PAK-1 and sPLA2, called Secretory Phospholipase Responsive liposomes or SPRL-IPA-3, and demonstrated their ability to alter prostate cancer growth. The efficacy of SPRL against other types of cancers is not well understood. We addressed this limitation by determining the ability of SPRL to induce cell death in a diverse panel of cells representing different stages of breast cancer, including the invasive but non-metastatic MCF-7 cells, and metastatic triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells such as MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-468, and MDA-MB-435. We investigated the role of sPLA2 in the disposition of these liposomes by comparing the efficacy of SPRL-IPA-3 to IPA-3 encapsulated in sterically stabilized liposomes (SSL-IPA-3), a formulation shown to be less sensitive to sPLA2. Both SSL-IPA-3 and SPRL-IPA-3 induced time- and dose-dependent decreases in MTT staining in all cell lines tested, but SPRL-IPA-3-induced effects in metastatic TNBC cell lines were superior over SSL-IPA-3. The reduction in MTT staining induced by SPRL-IPA-3 correlated to the expression of Group IIA sPLA2. sPLA2 expression also correlated to increased induction of apoptosis in TNBC cell lines by SPRL-IPA-3. These data suggest that SPRL-IPA-3 is selective for metastatic TNBC cells and that the efficacy of SPRL-IPA-3 is mediated, in part, by the expression of Group IIA sPLA2.""","""['Wided Najahi-Missaoui', 'Nhat D Quach', 'Payaningal R Somanath', 'Brian S Cummings']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Int J Mol Sci""","""['Effect of P21-activated kinase 1 (PAK-1) inhibition on cancer cell growth, migration, and invasion.', 'Evidence for distinct mechanisms of uptake and antitumor activity of secretory phospholipase A2 responsive liposome in prostate cancer.', 'Liposome-mediated delivery of the p21 activated kinase-1 (PAK-1) inhibitor IPA-3 limits prostate tumor growth in vivo.', 'p21-activated kinase inhibitors.', 'p21-Activated kinase inhibitors: a patent review.', 'Targeting P21-Activated Kinase-1 for Metastatic Prostate Cancer.', 'Liposomes in Cancer Therapy: How Did We Start and Where Are We Now.', 'Secretory Phospholipase A2 Digital Expression Analysis in Colon Adenocarcinoma.', 'p21-Activated Kinase 1 Promotes Breast Tumorigenesis via Phosphorylation and Activation of the Calcium/Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinase II.', 'The Use of Nanomedicine to Target Signaling by the PAK Kinases for Disease Treatment.']"""

Study design & methods:   This study analysed 105,349 cases of incident prostate cancer between 1982 and 2016 from the population-based Victorian Cancer Registry. We performed Poisson regression analyses to identify an association between an annual number of prostate cancer counts, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) tests and the elderly male population (≥65) after adjusting for population at risk and years. We also applied Bayesian spatial-temporal models to determine any association with prostate cancer incidence and area-level factors.  Results:   The overall trend of the age-standardized prostate cancer incidence was increasing. The highest age-specific incidence was observed among people aged 65-74 years in the pre- and post-PSA periods. Every increase in 1000 PSA tests per 100,000 population, prostate cancer incidence increased by 17% (relative risk [RR] = 1.17, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.13-1.22). A 1% increase in the proportion of the male population (≥65) correlated with a 7% increase in prostate cancer cases (RR = 1.07, 95% CI = 1.06-1.10). Compared with early PSA periods, decreasing trends of low-grade cases and growing trends of high- and intermediate-grade cases were observed after a decline in PSA test usage in late PSA periods. Men living in the most socioeconomically advantaged postal areas had a decreased risk of prostate cancer (RR = 0.914, 95% CI = 0.858-0.976).  Conclusions:   Age-specific risk of developing biological prostate cancer, temporal changes in PSA testing and an increasingly elderly population contributed to an increasing trend of prostate cancer incidence.

As an initial step to address this issue, we conducted a pilot phase 0 trial to determine the levels of tocopherols and their metabolites in prostate cancer patients undergoing radical prostatectomy. The patients were randomized to no supplementation or two capsules of a γ-T-rich vitamin E mixture daily for 7 or 14 day prior to prostatectomy.

It was also reported that only 5% of cancer patients access cancer care and 77% present with late-stage cancer coupled with low level of cancer health literacy in the population despite a wide coverage of primary healthcare facilities in Uganda. We aimed to contribute to reducing the unmet needs of cancer prevention and early detection services in Uganda through capacity building.  Methods:   In 2017, we conducted two national and six regional cancer control stakeholders' consultative meetings. In 2017 and 2018, we trained district primary healthcare teams on cancer prevention and early detection. We also developed cancer information materials for health workers and communities and conducted a follow-up after the training.  Results:   A total of 488 primary healthcare workers from 118 districts were trained. Forty-six health workers in the pilot East-central subregion were further trained in cervical, breast, and prostate cancer early detection (screening and early diagnosis) techniques. A total of 32,800 cancer information, education and communication materials; breast, cervical, prostate childhood and general cancer information booklets; health education guide, community cancer information flipcharts for village health teams and referral guidelines for suspected cancer were developed and distributed to 122 districts. Also, 16 public and private-not-for-profit regional hospitals, and one training institution received these materials. Audiovisual clips on breast, cervical, and prostate cancer were developed for mass and social media dissemination. A follow-up after six months to one year indicated that 75% of the districts had implemented at least one of the agreed actions proposed during the training.  Conclusions:   In Uganda, the unmet needs for cancer control services are enormous.

Objective:   To describe and evaluate surgical technique, biochemical response, and therapy-free survival (TFS) after salvage surgery in patients with local recurrence in the seminal vesicle bed.  Design, setting, and participants:   We retrospectively assessed 40 patients treated with open salvage surgery in two centres (11/2014-02/2020). All patients presented with biochemical recurrence (BCR) after RP with a singular local recurrence at PSMA PET imaging. Thirty-three (82.5%) patients received previous salvage radiation therapy.  Surgical procedure:   Open salvage surgery with PSMA radioguidance.  Measurements:   Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) nadir and percentage of patients with complete biochemical response (cBR) without further treatment (PSA < 0.2 ng/ml) after 6-16 wk were assessed. BCR-free survival and TFS were calculated using Kaplan-Meier estimates. Clavien-Dindo complications were evaluated.  Results and limitations:   Prior to salvage surgery, median PSA was 0.9 ng/ml (interquartile range [IQR]: 0.5-1.7 ng/ml). Postoperatively, median PSA nadir was 0.1 ng/ml (IQR: 0-0.4 ng/ml). In 31 (77.5%) patients, cBR was observed. During the median follow-up of 24.4 months, 22 (55.0%) patients experienced BCR and 12 (30.0%) received further therapy. At 1 yr of follow-up, BCR-free survival rate was 62.2% and TFS rate was 88.3%. Three (7.5%) Clavien-Dindo grade III complications were observed. The main limitations are the retrospective design, short follow-up, and lack of a control group.  Conclusions:   Salvage surgery of local recurrence within the seminal vesicle bed is feasible. It may present an opportunity in selected, locally recurrent patients to prolong BCR-free survival and increase TFS. Further studies are needed to confirm our findings.

It remains unclear how complex genome alterations affect molecular networks through changing protein levels and consequently biochemical states of tumor tissues.  Results:   Here, we investigate the propagation of genomic effects along the axis of gene expression during prostate cancer progression. We quantify genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic alterations based on 105 prostate samples, consisting of benign prostatic hyperplasia regions and malignant tumors, from 39 prostate cancer patients. Our analysis reveals the convergent effects of distinct copy number alterations impacting on common downstream proteins, which are important for establishing the tumor phenotype. We devise a network-based approach that integrates perturbations across different molecular layers, which identifies a sub-network consisting of nine genes whose joint activity positively correlates with increasingly aggressive tumor phenotypes and is predictive of recurrence-free survival. Further, our data reveal a wide spectrum of intra-patient network effects, ranging from similar to very distinct alterations on different molecular layers.  Conclusions:   This study uncovers molecular networks with considerable convergent alterations across tumor sites and patients.

Despite the good initial response, castration resistance and metastatic progression will inevitably occur. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) may be implicated in promoting metastasis of PCa after ADT. Our aim is to investigate the role and mechanism of CAFs-derived exosomes involving in metastasis of PCa after ADT.  Methods:   PCa cells were co-cultured with exosomes derived from 10 nM dihydrotestosterone (DHT)-treated (simulating the high androgen level of prostate cancer microenvironment) or ethanol (ETOH) -treated (simulating the castration level of prostate cancer microenvironment after ADT) CAFs, and their migration and invasion differences under castration condition were examined both in vitro and in vivo. The miRNA profiles of exosomes derived from DHT-treated CAFs and matched ETOH-treated CAFs were analysed via next generation sequencing. The transfer of exosomal miR-146a-5p from CAFs to PCa cells was identified by fluorescent microscopy. The function and direct target gene of exosomal miR-146a-5p in PCa cells were confirmed through Transwell assays, luciferase reporter, and western blot.  Results:   Compared with DHT-treated CAFs, exosomes derived from ETOH-treated CAFs dramatically increased migration and invasion of PCa cells under castration condition. MiR-146a-5p level in exosomes from ETOH-treated CAFs was significantly reduced. The loss of miR-146a-5p may strengthen the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) to accelerate cancer cells metastasis by modulating epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)/ERK pathway.

Shared decision making (SDM) is important in the decision making process, but SDM between prostate cancer patients receiving hormone therapy and physicians is not fully understood. This study tested hypotheses: ""Patients' perception of SDM is associated with treatment satisfaction, mediated by satisfaction with physicians' explanations and perceived effective decision making"" and ""The amount of information provided to patients by physicians on diseases and treatment is associated with treatment satisfaction mediated by patients' perceived SDM and satisfaction with physicians' explanations.""  Methods:   This cross-sectional study was conducted using an online panel via a private research company in Japan. The participants in this study were patients registered with the panel who had received or were currently receiving hormone therapy for prostate cancer and physicians registered with the panel who were treating patients with prostate cancer. Measures used in this study included a nine-item Shared Decision Making Questionnaire, levels of satisfaction with physicians' explanations and treatment satisfaction, and effective decision making for patients (feeling the choice is informed, value-based, likely to be implemented and expressing satisfaction with the choice), and a Shared Decision Making Questionnaire for Doctors. The hypotheses were examined using path analysis.  Results:   In total, 124 patients and 150 physicians were included in the analyses. In keeping with our hypotheses, perceived SDM significantly correlated with the physicians' explanations and perceived effective decision making for patients, and satisfaction with physicians' explanations and perceived effective decision making for patients were both related to treatment satisfaction. Although the amount of information provided to patients was correlated with the perceived SDM, it was indirectly related to their satisfaction with physicians' explanations.  Conclusions:   When physicians encourage patients to be actively involved in making decisions about treatment through the SDM process while presenting a wide range of information at the start of hormone therapy, patients' effective decision making and physicians' explanations may be improved; consequently, the patients' overall treatment satisfaction may be improved. Physicians who treat patients with prostate cancer may have underestimated the importance of SDM before starting hormone therapy, even greater extent than patients.""","""['Kazuhiro Nakayama', 'Wakako Osaka', 'Nobuaki Matsubara', 'Tsutomu Takeuchi', 'Mayumi Toyoda', 'Noriyuki Ohtake', 'Hiroji Uemura']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""BMC Med Inform Decis Mak""","""[""Patients' and physicians' gender and perspective on shared decision-making: A cross-sectional study from Dubai."", ""Physicians' perspective on shared decision-making in Dubai: a cross-sectional study."", ""Association between physicians' and patients' perspectives of shared decision making in primary care settings in Japan: The impact of environmental factors."", 'Use of the 9-item Shared Decision Making Questionnaire (SDM-Q-9 and SDM-Q-Doc) in intervention studies-A systematic review.', 'Exploring motivations and resistances for implementing shared decision-making in clinical practice: A systematic review based on a structure-process-outcome model.', 'Getting specific: participation preference in urooncological decision-making.', 'Acceptance of diagnosis and management satisfaction of patients with ""suspected Lyme borreliosis"" after 12\xa0months in a multidisciplinary reference center: a prospective cohort study.', 'Gender bias in shared decision-making among cancer care guidelines: A systematic review.', 'Shared decision-making practices and patient values in pharmacist outpatient care for rheumatic disease: A multiple correspondence analysis.', 'Improving access to oncology publications for advocates and people with cancer.']"""

Nevertheless, there is a lack of reports clarifying the association between aggravation of abscesses and radiation therapy, and hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) is effective for a peri-SpaceOAR abscess and rectal perforation.  Case presentation:   We report a case of a 78-year-old high-risk prostate cancer patient.

The provider cohort was created by querying the American Medical Association Physician Masterfile to identify physicians who had treated patients with prostatectomy, intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), brachytherapy, stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT), or proton therapy. Maps detailing the location of providers were created for each modality. Multivariate multinomial logistic regressions were used to assess the association between patient-provider distance and probability of treatment.  Results:   Cohorts consisted of 89,902 patients treated by 5518 physicians. Substantial numbers of providers practicing established modalities (IMRT, prostatectomy, and brachytherapy) were noted in major urban centers, whereas provider numbers were reduced in rural areas, most notably for brachytherapy. Ninety percent of prostate cancer patients lived within 35.1, 28.9, and 55.6 miles of a practitioner of prostatectomy, IMRT, and brachytherapy, respectively. Practitioners of emerging modalities (SBRT and proton therapy) were predominantly concentrated in urban locations, with 90% of patients living within 128 miles (SBRT) and 374.5 miles (proton). Greater distance was associated with decreased probability of treatment (IMRT -3.8% per 10 miles; prostatectomy -2.1%; brachytherapy -2%; proton therapy -1.6%; and SBRT -1.1%).  Conclusions:   Geographic disparities were noted for analyzed treatment modalities, and these disparities influenced delivery.""","""['Chad Tang', 'Xiudong Lei', 'Grace L Smith', 'Hubert Y Pan', 'Karen E Hoffman', 'Rachit Kumar', 'Brian F Chapin', 'Ya-Chen Tina Shih', 'Steven J Frank', 'Benjamin D Smith']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys""","""['National variation in the delivery of radiation oncology procedures in the non-facility-based setting.', 'Use, complications, and costs of stereotactic body radiotherapy for localized prostate cancer.', 'The early adoption of intensity-modulated radiotherapy and stereotactic body radiation treatment among older Medicare beneficiaries with prostate cancer.', 'Stereotactic body radiation therapy for prostate cancer-a review.', 'Salvage reirradiation for locoregional failure after radiation therapy for prostate cancer: who, when, where and how?', 'Addressing Challenges and Controversies in the Management of Prostate Cancer with Multidisciplinary Teams.', 'Cardiovascular disease prevention and management of pre-existent cardiovascular disease in a cohort of prostate cancer survivors.', 'Disparities in radiation therapy utilization for cancer patients in Victoria.', 'The Effect of Video-Based Education on Anxiety of Patients Receiving Stereotactic Radiosurgery and Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy.', 'Multidisciplinary clinics in prostate cancer.']"""

Optimal time to treatment is underexplored, so recommendations for which cancer treatments can be deferred are often based on expert opinion.  Objective:   To evaluate the association between increased time to definitive therapy and mortality as a function of cancer type and stage for the 4 most prevalent cancers in the US.  Design, setting, and participants:   This cohort study assessed treatment and outcome information from patients with nonmetastatic breast, prostate, non-small cell lung (NSCLC), and colon cancers from 2004 to 2015, with data analyzed January to March 2020. Data on outcomes associated with appropriate curative-intent surgical, radiation, or medical therapy were gathered from the National Cancer Database.  Exposures:   Time-to-treatment initiation (TTI), the interval between diagnosis and therapy, using intervals of 8 to 60, 61 to 120, 121 to 180, and greater than 180 days.  Main outcomes and measures:   5-year and 10-year predicted all-cause mortality.  Results:   This study included 2 241 706 patients (mean [SD] age 63 [11.9] years, 1 268 794 [56.6%] women, 1 880 317 [83.9%] White): 1 165 585 (52.0%) with breast cancer, 853 030 (38.1%) with prostate cancer, 130 597 (5.8%) with NSCLC, and 92 494 (4.1%) with colon cancer. Median (interquartile range) TTI by cancer was 32 (21-48) days for breast, 79 (55-117) days for prostate, 41 (27-62) days for NSCLC, and 26 (16-40) days for colon. Across all cancers, a general increase in the 5-year and 10-year predicted mortality was associated with increasing TTI. The most pronounced mortality association was for colon cancer (eg, 5 y predicted mortality, stage III: TTI 61-120 d, 38.9% vs. 181-365 d, 47.8%), followed by stage I NSCLC (5 y predicted mortality: TTI 61-120 d, 47.4% vs 181-365 d, 47.6%), while survival for prostate cancer was least associated (eg, 5 y predicted mortality, high risk: TTI 61-120 d, 12.8% vs 181-365 d, 14.1%), followed by breast cancer (eg, 5 y predicted mortality, stage I: TTI 61-120 d, 11.0% vs. 181-365 d, 15.2%). A nonsignificant difference in treatment delays and worsened survival was observed for stage II lung cancer patients-who had the highest all-cause mortality for any TTI regardless of treatment timing.  Conclusions and relevance:   In this cohort study, for all studied cancers there was evidence that shorter TTI was associated with lower mortality, suggesting an indirect association between treatment deferral and mortality that may not become evident for years.

A mathematical model for the development of interval cancers can provide useful information for evaluating cancer screening. In this regard a useful quantity is MIC, the mean duration in years of progressive preclinical cancer (PPC) that leads to interval cancers. Estimation of MIC involved extending a previous model to include three negative screens, invoking the multinomial-Poisson transformation to avoid estimating background cancer trends, and varying screening test sensitivity. Simulations show that when the true MIC is 0.5, the method yields a reasonably narrow range of estimated MICs over the range of screening test sensitivities from 0.5 to 1.0. If the lower bound on the screening test sensitivity is 0.7, the method performs considerably better even for larger MICs. The application of the method involved annual lung cancer screening in the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian trial. Assuming a normal distribution for PPC duration, the estimated MIC (95% confidence interval) ranged from 0.00 (0.00 to 0.34) at a screening test sensitivity of 1.0 to 0.54 (0.03, 1.00) at a screening test sensitivity of 0.5 Assuming an exponential distribution for PPC duration, which did not fit as well, the estimated MIC ranged from 0.27 (0.08, 0.49) at a screening test sensitivity of 0.5 to 0.73 (0.32, 1.26) at a screen test sensitivity of 1.0 Based on these results, investigators may wish to investigate more frequent lung cancer screening.""","""['Stuart G Baker']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Stat Med""","""['Detection of lung cancer through low-dose CT screening (NELSON): a prespecified analysis of screening test performance and interval cancers.', 'Overdiagnosis in lung cancer screening: Estimates from the German Lung Cancer Screening Intervention Trial.', 'Performance and Cost-Effectiveness of Computed Tomography Lung Cancer Screening Scenarios in a Population-Based Setting: A Microsimulation Modeling Analysis in Ontario, Canada.', 'Screening for Lung Cancer With Low-Dose Computed Tomography: An Evidence Review for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force Internet.', 'Screening for Colorectal Cancer: An Evidence Update for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force Internet.']"""

This evidence appeared to be a lockdown effect due to extraordinary restriction measures to slow down the spread of SARS-CoV-2. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the overall effects of the ongoing pandemic on gBRCA testing in our institution and to understand how COVID-19 has influenced testing after the complete lockdown (March 8-May 5, 2020). Additionally, we compared this year's trend with trends of the last 3 years to better monitor gBRCA testing progress. This detailed analysis highlights two important findings: (1) gBRCA testing did not increase significantly after the lockdown period (May-October 2020) compared with the lockdown period (March-April 2020), emphasizing that even after the lockdown period testing remained low. (2) Comparing the total tests per year (January-October 2017, 2018, 2019, with 2020), the impact of COVID-19 on gBRCA testing is apparent, with similarities of trends registered in 2017.

Patients and methods: All men diagnosed with localised PCa between January 2006 and December 2017, and treated at a university hospital in Oman were included in the study. Data included demographic information, clinical, laboratory, pathological and radiological features at presentation, treatment modalities, and survival outcomes. Patients were followed until April 2019 or until death for disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) whichever came first. Survival rates were estimated using the method of Kaplan and Meier. Univariate and multivariate analysis and Cox regression analyses were performed to study factors affecting DFS and OS. Results: Out of 239 men diagnosed with PCa over the study period, only 47 had localised disease (19.7%). The median age was 69 years. The majority (53.2%) had a Gleason score of ≥8 and a median (range) PSA level of 23.71 (range 0.6 - 452.9)ng/mL. In all, 16 patients received radical surgery, 17 received hormonal therapy along with definitive radiotherapy, while 15 were treated either with medical or surgical castration only. After a median follow-up of 43 months, the median DFS was 44.0 months. The median OS was not reached for the entire cohort. The 5- and 10-year OS rates were 84% and 57%, respectively Conclusion: Omani patients with localised PCa present with a high PSA level and a high Gleason score. Potentially curative treatments options, e.g. radical surgery and radiotherapy, are underutilised. The survival outcomes are similar to studies reported internationally.

In prostate cancer (PCa), it inhibits tumorigenesis by degrading several oncogenic substrates. SPOP is the most altered gene in PCa (~15%), which renders it ineffective, promoting cancer. The remaining PCa tumours, which retain WT-SPOP, still progress to castration-resistant (CRPC) stage, indicating that other critical mechanisms exist for downregulating SPOP. SPOP is reduced in ~94% of WT-SPOP-bearing prostate tumours; however, no molecular mechanism is known for its downregulation.  Methods:   SPOP was identified as a direct target of LIMK2 using an innovative technique. The reciprocal relationship between SPOP and LIMK2 and its consequences on oncogenicity were analysed using a variety of biochemical assays. To probe this relationship in vivo, xenograft studies were conducted.  Results:   LIMK2 degrades SPOP by direct phosphorylation at three sites. SPOP promotes LIMK2's ubiquitylation, creating a feedback loop. SPOP's degradation stabilises AR, ARv7 and c-Myc promoting oncogenicity. Phospho-resistant SPOP completely suppresses tumorigenesis in vivo, indicating that LIMK2-mediated SPOP degradation is a key event in PCa progression.  Conclusions:   While genomically altered SPOP-bearing tumours require gene therapy, uncovering LIMK2-SPOP relationship provides a powerful opportunity to retain WT-SPOP by inhibiting LIMK2, thereby halting disease progression.""","""['Kumar Nikhil', 'Hanan S Haymour', 'Mohini Kamra', 'Kavita Shah']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Br J Cancer""","""['Negative cross talk between LIMK2 and PTEN promotes castration resistant prostate cancer pathogenesis in cells and in vivo.', 'Mutated SPOP E3 Ligase Promotes 17βHSD4 Protein Degradation to Drive Androgenesis and Prostate Cancer Progression.', 'SPOP promotes CDCA5 degradation to regulate prostate cancer progression via the AKT pathway.', 'The emerging role of SPOP protein in tumorigenesis and cancer therapy.', 'ZBTB46, SPDEF, and ETV6: Novel Potential Biomarkers and Therapeutic Targets in Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'LIMK2: A Multifaceted kinase with pleiotropic roles in human physiology and pathologies.', 'LIM Kinases, LIMK1 and LIMK2, Are Crucial Node Actors of the Cell Fate: Molecular to Pathological Features.', 'O-GlcNAcylation of SPOP promotes carcinogenesis in hepatocellular carcinoma.', 'Comprehensive analysis of TP53 and SPOP mutations and their impact on survival in metastatic prostate cancer.', 'Characterization of 22q12 Microdeletions Causing Position Effect in Rare NF2 Patients with Complex Phenotypes.']"""

However, the functional importance of both SEMGs proteins in human neoplasms is still largely unknown. In this study, by using a combination of the bioinformatics and various cellular and molecular assays, we have demonstrated that SEMG1 and SEMG2 are frequently expressed in lung cancer clinical samples and cancer cell lines of different origins and are negatively associated with the survival rate of cancer patients.

Among the SEMGs interacting proteins we noticed two critical glycolytic enzymes-pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) and lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA). Importantly, we showed that SEMGs increased the protein level and activity of both PKM2 and LDHA.

Reliable and automated segmentation of the prostate gland in MRI data is exceptionally critical for diagnosis and treatment planning of prostate cancer. Although many automated segmentation methods have emerged, including deep learning based approaches, segmentation performance is still poor due to the large variability of image appearance, anisotropic spatial resolution, and imaging interference. This study proposes an automated prostate MRI data segmentation approach using bicubic interpolation with improved 3D V-Net (dubbed 3D PBV-Net). Considering the low-frequency components in the prostate gland, the bicubic interpolation is applied to preprocess the MRI data. On this basis, a 3D PBV-Net is developed to perform prostate MRI data segmentation. To illustrate the effectiveness of our approach, we evaluate the proposed 3D PBV-Net on two clinical prostate MRI data datasets, i.e., PROMISE 12 and TPHOH, with the manual delineations available as the ground truth. Our approach generates promising segmentation results, which have achieved 97.65% and 98.29% of average accuracy, 0.9613 and 0.9765 of Dice metric, 3.120 mm and 0.9382 mm of Hausdorff distance, and average boundary distance of 1.708, 0.7950 on PROMISE 12 and TPHOH datasets, respectively.

This study reports for the first time on the synthesis of a phospholipid radiotracer based on the phospholipid 1,2-didocosahexaenoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (PC44:12) to allow tracking of polyunsaturated lipid tumor uptake via PET imaging. This tracer may aid in the development of strategies to modulate response to therapies targeting lipid metabolism in prostate cancer.  Methods:   Lipidomics analysis of prostate tumor explants and LNCaP tumor cells were used to identify PC44:12 as a potential phospholipid candidate for radiotracer development. Synthesis of phosphocholine precursor and non-radioactive standard were optimised using click chemistry. The biodistribution of a fluorine-18 labeled analogue, N-{[4-(2-[18F]fluoroethyl)-2,3,4-triazol-1-yl]methyl}-1,2-didocosahexaenoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine ([18F]2) was determined in LNCaP prostate tumor-bearing NOD SCID gamma mice by ex vivo biodistribution and PET imaging studies and compared to biodistribution of [18F]fluoromethylcholine.  Results:   [18F]2 was produced with a decay-corrected yield of 17.8 ± 3.7% and an average radiochemical purity of 97.00 ± 0.89% (n = 6). Molar activity was 85.1 ± 3.45 GBq/μmol (2300 ± 93 mCi/μmol) and the total synthesis time was 2 h. Ex vivo biodistribution data demonstrated high liver uptake (41.1 ± 9.2%ID/g) and high splenic uptake (10.9 ± 9.1%ID/g) 50 min post-injection. Ex vivo biodistribution showed low absolute tumor uptake of [18F]2 (0.8 ± 0.3%ID/g). However, dynamic PET imaging demonstrated an increase over time of the relative tumor-to-muscle ratio with a peak of 2.8 ± 0.5 reached 1 h post-injection. In contrast, dynamic PET of [18F]fluoromethylcholine demonstrated no increase in tumor-to-muscle ratios due to an increase in both tumor and muscle over time. Absolute uptake of [18F]fluoromethylcholine was higher and peaked at 60 min post injection (2.25 ± 0.29%ID/g) compared to [18F]2 (1.44 ± 0.06%ID/g) during the 1 h dynamic scan period.

During delivery, prostate motion was tracked with implanted EMT. SBRT was interrupted when a 3-mm threshold was trespassed and corrected unless the offset was transient. Motion-encoded reconstructed (MER) plans were obtained by splitting the original plans into multiple sub-beams with isocenter shifts based on recorded EMT positions, mimicking prostate motion during treatment.

Material and methods:   Stratified analyses (Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results [2004-2016]) tested the effect of race/ethnicity on histology and stage. Cumulative incidence-plots and multivariable competing-risks regression models (CRR), addressed CSM, after matching for TNM-stage, histology, age, and gender.  Results:   Of 1,904 urethral cancer patients, 71% were Caucasian, 16% African American, 7% Hispanic and 5% other. African Americans were younger (66 years) than Caucasians (73 years) and Hispanics (74 years). In African Americans, adenocarcinoma (25%) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC; 29%) were more frequent than in Caucasians (12% and 23%) or Hispanics (15% and 20%). African Americans with adenocarcinoma exhibited higher stage than other adenocarcinoma patients. In CRR, African Americans (35%) and Hispanics (29%) exhibited highest and second highest 3-year CSM, even after matching. After further multivariable adjustment of matched CRRs, CSM was higher in Hispanics (HR: 1.93, P= 0.03) and in African Americans (Hazard ratio 1.35, P= 0.07), relative to Caucasians.  Conclusion:   Race/ethnicity impacts important differences on urethral cancer patients. African American race/ethnicity predisposes to higher rate of SCC and adenocarcinoma. Moreover, African Americans are younger and present with higher stage at diagnoses.

Previous reports have identified that 5% of the population accounts for 50% of the nation's annual health care spending. To date, the assessment of the top 5% resource-patients among men diagnosed with prostate cancer (PCa) has never been performed. We investigate the determinants and health care utilization of high resource-patients diagnosed with PCa using a population-based cohort using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Medicare-linked database.  Methods:   Men aged ≥66-year-old with a primary diagnosis of PCa in 2009 were identified. High resource spenders were defined as the top 5% of the sum of the total cost incurred for all services rendered per beneficiary. The spending in each group and predictors of being a high resource-patient were assessed.  Results:   The top 5% resource-patients consisted of 646 men who spent a total of $62,474,504, comprising 26% of the total cost incurred for all 12,875 men who were diagnosed with PCa in 2009. Of the top 5% resource-patients, the average amount spent per patient was $96,710 vs. $14,664 among the bottom 95% resource-patients. In adjusted analyses, older (odds ratio [OR]: 1.02, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.00-1.03), Charlson Comorbidity Index ≥2 (OR: 3.78, 95% CI: 3.10-4.60) men, and advanced disease (metastasis OR: 2.29, 95% CI: 1.68-3.11) were predictors of being a top 5% resource-patient. Of these patients, 210 men died within 1 year of PCa diagnosis (32.5%) vs. 606 men of the bottom 95% resource-patients (5.0%, P < 0.001).  Conclusion:   Five percent of men diagnosed with PCa bore 26% of the total cost incurred for all men diagnosed with the disease in 2009.

As Ra-223 and most of its progeny emit alpha particles, especially the internal exposure of persons in the patient's vicinity had to be evaluated.  Methods:   The external radiation was measured in distances of 1 m and 2 m. Wipe-tests were taken in the patients' homes to identify significant contaminations and evaluated by liquid scintillation counting.

Due to the long incubation time and insidious condition, early diagnosis is difficult; especially imaging diagnosis is more difficult. In actual clinical practice, the method of manual segmentation by medical experts is mainly used, which is time-consuming and labor-intensive and relies heavily on the experience and ability of medical experts. The rapid, accurate and repeatable segmentation of the prostate area is still a challenging problem. It is important to explore the automated segmentation of prostate images based on the 3D AlexNet network.  Method:   Taking the medical image of prostate cancer as the entry point, the three-dimensional data is introduced into the deep learning convolutional neural network. This paper proposes a 3D AlexNet method for the automatic segmentation of prostate cancer magnetic resonance images, and the general network ResNet 50, Inception -V4 compares network performance.  Results:   Based on the training samples of magnetic resonance images of 500 prostate cancer patients, a set of 3D AlexNet with simple structure and excellent performance was established through adaptive improvement on the basis of classic AlexNet. The accuracy rate was as high as 0.921, the specificity was 0.896, and the sensitivity It is 0.902 and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) is 0.964. The Mean Absolute Distance (MAD) between the segmentation result and the medical expert's gold standard is 0.356 mm, and the Hausdorff distance (HD) is 1.024 mm, the Dice similarity coefficient is 0.9768.  Conclusion:   The improved 3D AlexNet can automatically complete the structured segmentation of prostate magnetic resonance images. Compared with traditional segmentation methods and depth segmentation methods, the performance of the 3D AlexNet network is superior in terms of training time and parameter amount, or network performance evaluation. Compared with the algorithm, it proves the effectiveness of this method.""","""['Jun Chen', 'Zhechao Wan', 'Jiacheng Zhang', 'Wenhua Li', 'Yanbing Chen', 'Yuebing Li', 'Yue Duan']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Comput Methods Programs Biomed""","""['Automatic prostate segmentation using deep learning on clinically diverse 3D transrectal ultrasound images.', 'Medical image diagnosis of prostate tumor based on PSP-Net+VGG16 deep learning network.', 'Deeply supervised 3D fully convolutional networks with group dilated convolution for automatic MRI prostate segmentation.', 'VoxResNet: Deep voxelwise residual networks for brain segmentation from 3D MR images.', '3D Deep Learning on Medical Images: A Review.', 'Comparative study of convolutional neural network architectures for gastrointestinal lesions classification.', 'Fully Convolutional Network for the Semantic Segmentation of Medical Images: A Survey.', 'Dataset of prostate MRI annotated for anatomical zones and cancer.', 'Automatic Diagnosis of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder with Continuous Wavelet Transform and Convolutional Neural Network.', 'Early Detection of Cervical Cancer by Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging Microscopy Combined with Unsupervised Machine Learning.']"""

However, the disease relevant function of m6A on specific oncogenic long non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) is not well understood.  Methods:   We analyzed the m6A status using patients samples and bone metastatic PDXs. Through m6A high-throughput sequencing, we identified the m6A sites on NEAT1-1 in prostate bone metastatic PDXs. Mass spec assay showed interaction among NEAT1-1, CYCLINL1 and CDK19. RNA EMSA, RNA pull-down, mutagenesis, CLIP, western blot, ChIP and ChIRP assays were used to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying the functions of m6A on NEAT1-1. Loss-of function and rescued experiments were executed to detect the biological roles of m6A on NEAT1-1 in the PDX cell phenotypes in vivo.  Results:   In this study, we identified 4 credible m6A sites on long ncRNA NEAT1-1. High m6A level of NEAT1-1 was related to bone metastasis of prostate cancer and m6A level of NEAT1-1 was a powerful predictor of eventual death. Transcribed NEAT1-1 served as a bridge to facility the binding between CYCLINL1 and CDK19 and promoted the Pol II ser2 phosphorylation. Importantly, depletion of NEAT1-1or decreased m6A of NEAT1-1 impaired Pol II Ser-2p level in the promoter of RUNX2. Overexpression of NEAT1-1 induced cancer cell metastasis to lung and bone; xenograft growth and shortened the survival of mice, but NEAT1-1 with m6A site mutation failed to do these.  Conclusion:   Collectively, the findings indicate that m6A on ncRNA NEAT1-1 takes critical role in regulating Pol II ser2 phosphorylation and may be novel specific target for bone metastasis cancer therapy and diagnosis. New complex CYCLINL1/CDK19/NEAT1-1 might provide new insight into the potential mechanism of the pathogenesis and development of bone metastatic prostate cancer.""","""['Simeng Wen', 'Yulei Wei', 'Chong Zen', 'Wei Xiong', 'Yuanjie Niu', 'Yu Zhao']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Mol Cancer""","""['LncRNA nuclear-enriched abundant transcript 1 shuttled by prostate cancer cells-secreted exosomes initiates osteoblastic phenotypes in the bone metastatic microenvironment via miR-205-5p/runt-related transcription factor 2/splicing factor proline- and glutamine-rich/polypyrimidine tract-binding protein 2 axis.', 'Methyltransferase-like 14 suppresses growth and metastasis of renal cell carcinoma by decreasing long noncoding RNA NEAT1.', 'm6 A modification of lncRNA PCAT6 promotes bone metastasis in prostate cancer through IGF2BP2-mediated IGF1R mRNA stabilization.', 'Novel insights into the interaction between N6-methyladenosine methylation and noncoding RNAs in musculoskeletal disorders.', 'Novel Insights Into the Role of N6-Methyladenosine RNA Modification in Bone Pathophysiology.', 'Long noncoding RNA study: Genome-wide approaches.', 'Linc00662 m6A promotes the progression and metastasis of pancreatic cancer by activating focal adhesion through the GTF2B-ITGA1-FAK pathway.', 'PET imaging of new target CDK19 in prostate cancer.', 'Epigenetic Modifications in Prostate Cancer Metastasis and Microenvironment.', 'SINEUP non-coding RNA activity depends on specific N6-methyladenosine nucleotides.']"""

However, while rates are usually lower for 'lifestyle-related' cancers (e.g. breast, prostate, lung, colorectal), they are typically elevated for 'infection-related' ones such as liver and stomach cancer. Although these observations appear in line with the theory of 'migration as a rapid epidemiological transition', changes in cancer risk after migration have yet to be investigated, effectively testing if migration also entails a 'rapid cancer risk transition'. This study therefore examines cancer risk among migrants in Belgium, focusing on colorectal cancer as a typically lifestyle-related cancer on the one hand, and infection-related cancers on the other hand. We subdivide migrant groups of more and less industrialised country origin according to duration of stay, and calculate absolute and relative incidence rates between 2004 and 2013. Our findings corroborate the transition assumptions for men from Turkey and Morocco, but cannot support them for women. Italian male immigrants have an in-between position: their colorectal cancer risk does not differ from that of Belgian men, but infection-related and non-cardia stomach cancer risks are higher and remain so with longer duration of stay. The fact that rates for migrants from the Netherlands and France generally do not differ from those of Belgians further strengthens support for a cancer transition among male migrants. Further examinations should focus on changes in health-related behaviour that can explain persistently low colorectal cancer risks among Turkish and Moroccan migrants and can inform preventive strategies for other population subgroups. Knowledge about the higher non-cardia stomach cancer risk among Turkish, Moroccan, and Italian men can support early detection strategies by primary care providers when patients present with gastric symptoms, especially because this cancer tends to have unfavourable prognosis.""","""['Wanda M J Van Hemelrijck', 'Michael Rosskamp', 'Harlinde De Schutter', 'Freija Verdoodt', 'Katrien Vanthomme']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Soc Sci Med""","""['Trends in Belgian cause-specific mortality by migrant origin between the 1990s and the 2000s.', 'Diverging breast and stomach cancer incidence and survival in migrants in The Netherlands, 1996-2009.', 'Breast and stomach cancer incidence and survival in migrants in the Netherlands, 1996-2006.', 'Institutional Elderly Care Services and Moroccan and Turkish Migrants in Belgium: A Literature Review.', 'Mortality among non-western migrants in The Netherlands.', 'A population-based cohort study on changes in breast, lung and colorectal cancer incidence and mortality among non-Western immigrant women.', 'Colorectal cancer incidence and survival inequalities among labour immigrants in Belgium during 2004-2013.', 'Health inequalities among Russian-born immigrant women in Finland: Longitudinal analysis on cervical cancer incidence and participation in screening.', 'Cancer Incidence in Migrants in Australia: Patterns of Three Infection-Related Cancers.', 'Effect of Human Development Index and other socioeconomic factors on mortality-to-incidence ratio of lips and oral cavity cancer in Mexican states: an ecological study.']"""

To verify and compare the apoptosis, AnnexinV-PI flowcytometry and DNA fragmentation assay were performed, and the influence of the compounds on ROS generation was assessed. Changes in MMP and protein expression were analyzed by flowcytometry and western blot, respectively. The results showed that ZEO can act as an amplifier to sensitize PC3 prostate cancer cells to undergo ROS generation and apoptosis.

Previous data have suggested disparities in receipt of adjuvant radiation therapy for adverse pathologic features according to travel distance. Among patients without adverse pathologic features (pT2 disease and negative margins), the main indication for PORT is a persistent postoperative detectable PSA. However, it remains unknown whether the rate of receipt of PORT in this cohort of men with persistently detectable PSA is related to travel distance from the treating facility.  Methods and materials:   Using the National Cancer Database, we identified 170,379 men with prostate cancer diagnosed from 2004 to 2015 managed with upfront surgery who were found to have pT2 disease with negative surgical margins. Multivariable logistic regression defined adjusted odds ratios (AORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of receiving PORT as the primary dependent variable and distance (<5, 5-10, 10-20, ≥20 miles from the treatment facility) as the primary independent variable.  Results:   Within our cohort, progressively farther distance from the treatment facility was associated with lower rates of PORT. In patients living <5 miles, 5 to 10 miles, 10 to 20 miles, and >20 miles from the treating facility, rates of PORT of were 1.37% (referent), 1.16% (AOR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.79-1.04; P = .158), 0.98% (AOR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.70-0.93; P = .003), and 0.64% (AOR, 0.47; 95% CI, 0.41-0.54; P < .001), respectively.  Conclusions:   For men with localized prostate cancer without adverse pathologic features managed with surgery, increasing distance from treatment facility was associated with lower receipt of PORT. Given that the rate of a persistent postoperative detectable PSA is unlikely to depend on the distance to the treatment facility, these findings raise the possibility that the geographic availability of radiation treatment facilities influences the decision to undergo PORT for patients with persistent postoperative detectable PSA.""","""['Melaku A Arega', 'David D Yang', 'Trevor J Royce', 'Brandon A Mahal', 'Edward Christopher Dee', 'Santino S Butler', 'Sybil Sha', 'Kent W Mouw', 'Paul L Nguyen', 'Vinayak Muralidhar']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Pract Radiat Oncol""","""['Association Between Travel Distance and Choice of Treatment for Prostate Cancer: Does Geography Reduce Patient Choice?', 'Travel Distance as a Barrier to Receipt of Adjuvant Radiation Therapy After Radical Prostatectomy.', 'Assessing the Optimal Timing for Early Salvage Radiation Therapy in Patients with Prostate-specific Antigen Rise After Radical Prostatectomy.', 'Treatment outcome with adjuvant and salvage irradiation after radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer.', 'Effect of radiation therapy on detectable serum prostate specific antigen levels following radical prostatectomy: early versus delayed treatment.']"""

Following the RTOG-0938 compliance criteria and utilizing two-full arc geometry, VMAT prostate SBRT plans were generated for ten consecutive patients using advanced Acuros-based algorithm for heterogeneity corrections with Halcyon couch insert. Halcyon VMAT plans with the stacked and staggered multileaf collimators (MLC) produced highly conformal SBRT dose distributions to the prostate, lower intermediate dose spillage and similar dose to adjacent organs-at-risks (OARs) compared to SBRT-dedicated Truebeam VMAT plans. Due to lower monitor units per fraction and less MLC modulation through the target, the Halcyon VMAT plan can deliver prostate SBRT fractions in and overall treatment time of less than 10 minutes (for 36.25 Gy in five fractions), significantly improving patient compliance and clinic workflow. Pretreatment quality assurance results were similar to Truebeam VMAT plans. We have implemented Halcyon Linac for prostate SBRT treatment in our institution.

This study was undertaken to estimate the impact of ESRP1 and ESRP2 alterations on prostate cancer patient prognosis.  Methods:   A tissue microarray made from 17,747 individual cancer samples with comprehensive, pathological, clinical and molecular data was analyzed by immunohistochemistry for ESRP1 and ESRP2.  Results:   Nuclear staining for ESRP1 was seen in 38.6% (36.0% low, 2.6% high) of 12,140 interpretable cancers and in 41.9% (36.4% low, 5.3% high) of 12,962 interpretable cancers for ESRP2.

A study of adverse events during endurance and resistance training - data from the Phys-Can study""","""Introduction:   Few studies have systematically evaluated the risk of adverse events (AEs) among persons exercising during oncological treatment. We aimed to describe incidence and types of AEs during exercise for persons undergoing oncological treatment, and associations to exercise intensity, exercise adherence, chemotherapy treatment, initial aerobic fitness. A second aim was to compare incidence of lymphedema, periphery inserted central catheter (PICC) complications, and other new medical conditions (any illness or injury occurred during the exercise trial) between high-intensity vs low-to-moderate exercise and usual care (UC).  Methods:   This descriptive, comparative study was based on data from an observational study including patients in an UC setting (n = 90) and a randomized exercise trial (n = 577) in which participants exercised at high-intensity (HI) or low-moderate intensity (LMI). Persons with breast, prostate, or colorectal cancer undergoing neo/adjuvant treatment were included. AEs were reported by exercise coaches, participants, and identified in medical records, as were lymphedema, PICC-complications, and new medical conditions.  Results:   Coaches reported AEs for 20% of the participants, while 28% of participants self-reported AEs. The most common coach- and participant reported AEs were musculoskeletal and the majority (97%) were considered minor. HI had higher likelihood of AEs than LMI, according to both coaches (OR: 1.9 [95%CI 1.16-3.21], p=.011) and participants (OR: 3.36 [95%CI 2.00-5.62], ≤.001). Lymphedema rates were low (4-9%) and PICC complications ranged from 15% in LMI to 23% in UC and there were no statistically significant differences between HI, LMI, and UC. There were no statistically significant differences between HI and LMI regarding new medical conditions.  Conclusions:   Exercise during treatment is safe for these patient groups in this setting, even HI exercise can be recommended if no medical contraindications are present. Similar to healthy populations, a higher risk of having minor AEs when exercising at HI in comparison to LMI may exist.""","""['Anna Henriksson', 'Birgitta Johansson', 'Calin Radu', 'Sveinung Berntsen', 'Helena Igelström', 'Karin Nordin']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Acta Oncol""","""['Long-term resource utilisation and associated costs of exercise during (neo)adjuvant oncological treatment: the Phys-Can project.', 'Patterns and determinants of adherence to resistance and endurance training during cancer treatment in the Phys-Can RCT.', 'Randomized controlled trial of the effects of high intensity and low-to-moderate intensity exercise on physical fitness and fatigue in cancer survivors: results of the Resistance and Endurance exercise After ChemoTherapy (REACT) study.', 'Physical exercise training interventions for children and young adults during and after treatment for childhood cancer.', 'Physical exercise training interventions for children and young adults during and after treatment for childhood cancer.', 'Exercise effects on functional capacity and quality of life in older patients with colorectal cancer: study protocol for the ECOOL randomized controlled trial.', 'Exercise Counteracts the Deleterious Effects of Cancer Cachexia.', 'Short- and long-term effect of high versus low-to-moderate intensity exercise to optimise health-related quality of life after oncological treatment-results from the Phys-Can project.', 'Effect of Supervised Resistance Training on Arm Volume, Quality of Life and Physical Perfomance Among Women at High Risk for Breast Cancer-Related Lymphedema: A Study Protocol for a Randomized Controlled Trial (STRONG-B).']"""

Herein, BrCa, PCa, and benign cell lines were treated with two ionic liquids and two quinoxalines and functional experiments were performed-namely cell viability, apoptosis, cytotoxicity, and colony formation assays. At the molecular level, an array of gene expressions encompassing several molecular pathways were used to explore the impact of treatment on gene expression. Although both quinoxalines and the ionic liquid [C2OHMIM][Amp] did not show any effect on the BrCa and PCa cell lines, [C16Pyr][Amp] significantly decreased cell viability and colony formation ability, while it increased the apoptosis levels of all cell lines. Importantly, [C16Pyr][Amp] was found to be more selective for cancer cells and less toxic than cisplatin. At the molecular level, this ionic liquid was also associated with reduced expression levels of CPT2, LDHA, MCM2, and SKP2, in both BrCa and PCa cell lines. Hence, [C16Pyr][Amp] was shown to be a promising anticancer therapeutic agent for BrCa and PCa cell lines.""","""['Filipa Quintela Vieira', 'Ângela Marques-Magalhães', 'Vera Miranda-Gonçalves', 'Ricardo Ferraz', 'Mónica Vieira', 'Cristina Prudêncio', 'Carmen Jerónimo', 'Regina Augusta Silva']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Int J Mol Sci""","""['Antitumor Activity of Ionic Liquids Based on Ampicillin.', 'Total saponins from Paris forrestii (Takht) H.

Clinical applications have shown that approximately 30% of patients acquire resistance after a short period of treatment. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying this resistance is not completely understood. To identify transcriptomic signatures associated with acquisition of drug resistance we profiled gene expression of paired enzalutamide sensitive and resistant human prostate cancer LNCaP (lymph node carcinoma of the prostate) and C4-2B cells. Overlapping genes differentially regulated in the enzalutamide resistant cells were ranked by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis and their functional validation was performed using ingenuity knowledge database followed by confirmation to correlate transcript with protein expression. Analysis revealed that genes associated with cancer stem cells, such as POU5F1 (OCT4), SOX2, NANOG, BMI1, BMP2, CD44, SOX9, and ALDH1 were markedly upregulated in enzalutamide resistant cells. Amongst the pathways enriched in the enzalutamide-resistant cells were those associated with RUNX2, hedgehog, integrin signaling, and molecules associated with elastic fibers. Further examination of a patient cohort undergoing ADT and its comparison with no-ADT group demonstrated high expression of POU5F1 (OCT4), ALDH1, and SOX2 in ADT specimens, suggesting that they may be clinically relevant therapeutic targets.

Methods:   We included a prospective cohort of 139,534 cancer-free individuals from 10 United States research centers with over ten years of follow-up. We used a Cox regression model to assess the association between PM2.5 exposure and colorectal cancer incidence by calculating the hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) with adjustment for potential confounders. The polygenic risk score (PRS) and genome-wide interaction analysis (GWIA) were used to evaluate the multiplicative interaction between PM2.5 exposure and genetic variants in regard to colorectal cancer risk.  Results:   After a median of 10.43 years of follow-up, 1,666 participants had been diagnosed with colorectal cancer. PM2.5 exposure was significantly associated with an increased risk of colorectal cancer (HR = 1.27; 95% CI = 1.17-1.37 per 5 μg/m3 increase). Five independent susceptibility loci reached statistical significance at P < 1.22 × 10-8 in the interaction analysis. Furthermore, a joint interaction was observed between PM2.5 exposure and the PRS based on these five loci with colorectal cancer risk (P = 3.11 × 10-29). The Gene Ontology analysis showed that the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptor signaling pathway was involved in the biological process of colorectal cancer.

Glycometabolic prognostic signatures were identified and validated in a TCGA cohort and tested in an ICGC cohort. We used the gene set enrichment analysis to reveal biological processes associated with the glycometabolism-related signatures. Novel glycometabolism-related genes were selected for verifying their oncogenic phenotypes in vitro.  Results:   Two glycometabolic prognostic signatures were applied respectively to construct risk score formulas for PCa. Survival and receiver operating characteristic curve analyses were performed to detect the value of these prognostic signatures. We performed univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses in the TCGA cohort, demonstrating the independence of the prognostic signatures. Three glycometabolism-related genes were found to be novel PCa-associated genes. These were shown to affect proliferation, cell cycle progression, and glycolysis of DU145 and PC3 cells in different degrees.  Conclusion:   The present research represents the first glycometabolic and high-throughput investigation on PCa, revealing potential biomarkers and treatment targets. We confirm the vital role of glycometabolism in PCa and provide essential resources for future exploration of metabolism in PCa.""","""['Yao Zhang', 'Yanhua Mou', 'Chao Liang', 'Shenhao Zhu', 'Shouyong Liu', 'Pengfei Shao', 'Jie Li', 'Zengjun Wang']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['A TMEFF2-regulated cell cycle derived gene signature is prognostic of recurrence risk in prostate cancer.', 'Random forest-based modelling to detect biomarkers for prostate cancer progression.', 'Epigenetic signature of Gleason score and prostate cancer recurrence after radical prostatectomy.', 'The prognostic and predictive value of TMPRSS2-ERG gene fusion and ERG protein expression in prostate cancer biopsies.', 'The role of glycometabolic plasticity in cancer.', 'A harmonized resource of integrated prostate cancer clinical, -omic, and signature features.', 'Inhibition of Expression of the Circadian Clock Gene Cryptochrome 1 Causes Abnormal Glucometabolic and Cell Growth in Bombyx mori Cells.', 'curatedPCaData: Integration of clinical, genomic, and signature features in a curated and harmonized prostate cancer data resource.', 'Glycometabolism-related gene signature of hepatocellular carcinoma predicts prognosis and guides immunotherapy.', 'B-MYB-p53-related relevant regulator for the progression of clear cell renal cell carcinoma.']"""

Herein, with a cohort of 384 men, we performed mast cell subtyping and report that higher minimum number of the tryptase-only (MCT ) subset of extra-tumoral mast cells is associated with increased risk of biochemical recurrence (comparing highest to lowest tertiles: HR 2.32, 95% CI 1.37-3.93; P-trend = 0.002), metastases (HR 3.62, 95% CI 1.75-7.47; P-trend 0.001), and death from prostate cancer (HR 2.87, 95% CI 1.19-6.95; P-trend = 0.02). Preliminary RNA sequencing and comparison of benign versus cancer tissue mast cells revealed differential expression of additional site-specific genes. We further demonstrate that the genes CXCR4 and TFE3 are more highly expressed in tumor-infiltrating mast cells as well as other tumor-infiltrating immune cells and in tumor cells, respectively, and represent an altered tumor microenvironment. KIT variants were also differentially expressed in benign versus cancer tissue mast cells, with KIT variant 1 (GNNK+ ) mast cells identified as more prevalent in extra-tumoral regions of the prostate. Finally, using an established mouse model, we found that mast cells do not infiltrate Hi-Myc tumors, providing a model to specifically examine the role of extra-tumoral mast cells in tumorigenesis. Hi-Myc mice crossed to mast cell knockout (Wsh) mice and aged to 1 year revealed a higher degree of pre-invasive lesions and invasive cancer in wild-type mice versus heterozygous and knockout mice. This suggests a dosage effect where higher numbers of extra-tumoral mast cells resulted in higher cancer invasion. Overall, our studies provide further evidence for a role of extra-tumoral mast cells in driving adverse prostate cancer outcomes. © 2020 The Pathological Society of Great Britain and Ireland.

The ExPeCT trial aimed to examine the effectiveness of a structured exercise programme in modulating levels of CTCs and platelet cloaking in patients with metastatic prostate cancer.  Methods:   Participants (n = 61) were randomised into either standard care (control) or exercise arms. Whole blood was collected for all participants at baseline (T0), three months (T3) and six months (T6), and analysed for the presence of CTCs, CTC clusters and platelet cloaking. CTC data was correlated with clinico-pathological information.  Results:   Changes in CTC number were observed within group over time, however no significant difference in CTC number was observed between groups over time. Platelet cloaking was identified in 29.5% of participants.

Materials and methods:   Between March 2015 and November 2020, 1161 patients underwent mpMRI/Ultrasound-fusion-guided prostate biopsy (FBx) and concurrent 12-core systematic prostate biopsy (SBx) at the Department of Urology of the Ludwig-Maximilians-University of Munich, Germany. 848/ 1161 (73%) patients presented with either PI-RADS 4 or 5 index lesion and were retrospectively evaluated. Multivariate analysis was performed to evaluate clinical parameters associated with a negative outcome of PI-RADS 4 or 5 category lesions after FBx. Area under the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve (AUC) was conducted using ROC-analysis.  Results:   676/848 (79.7%) patients with either PI-RADS 4 or 5 index lesion were diagnosed with prostate cancer (PCa) by FBx and 172/848 (20.3%) patients had a negative biopsy (including the concurrent systematic prostate biopsy), respectively.

Material and methods:   This is a retrospective pilot study of 50 patients after irreversible electroporation (IRE) in prostate cancer between 50-79 years (mean age 65 years). Each patient received a transabdominal sonography using a 1-6 MHz convex matrix probe. Contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) was performed after i.v. bolus injection of 2.0 ml sulphur hexafluoride microbubbles. DICOM loops were continuously stored up to one minute. Parametric images were calculated by integrated perfusion analysis software. A comparison was drawn to a follow-up MRI six months after ablation.  Results:   While 13 patients showed local recurrence, 37 patients were successfully treated, meaning no local recurrence within six months after ablation. 18 patients showed signs of prostatitis after IRE. Tumorous changes were visually characterized by dynamic early nodular hypervascularization with fast and high wash-in. Correspondingly, nodular red and yellow shades were seen in parametric imaging. All patients with remaining tumor were correctly identified with CEUS and parametric imaging. After IRE there is a relevant decrease in tumor microcirculation in all patients, as seen in more purple shades of the prostate. The sensitivity for detecting residual tumor with CEUS compared to MRI was 76%, the specificity was 81%. The corresponding positive predictive value (PPV) was 73% and the negative predictive value (NPV) was 83%.

In-gantry MRI-guided biopsy (MRGB) of the prostate has been shown to be more accurate than other targeted prostate biopsy methods. However, the optimal number of cores to obtain during in-gantry MRGB remains undetermined. OBJECTIVE. The purpose of this study was to assess the diagnostic yield of obtaining an incremental number of cores from the primary lesion and of second lesion sampling during in-gantry MRGB of the prostate. METHODS. This retrospective study included 128 men with 163 prostate lesions who underwent in-gantry MRGB between 2016 and 2019. The men had a total of 163 lesions sampled with two or more cores, 121 lesions sampled with three or more cores, and 52 lesions sampled with four or more cores. A total of 40 men underwent sampling of a second lesion. Upgrade on a given core was defined as a greater International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) grade group (GG) relative to the previously obtained cores. Clinically significant prostate cancer (csPCa) was defined as ISUP GG 2 or greater. RESULTS. The frequency of any upgrade was 12.9% (21/163) on core 2 versus 10.7% (13/121) on core 3 (p = .29 relative to core 2) and 1.9% (1/52) on core 4 (p = .03 relative to core 3). The frequency of upgrade to csPCa was 7.4% (12/163) on core 2 versus 4.1% (5/121) on core 3 (p = .13 relative to core 2) and 0% (0/52) on core 4 (p = .07 relative to core 3). The frequency of upgrade on core 2 was higher for anterior lesions (p < .001) and lesions with a higher PI-RADS score (p = .007); the frequency of upgrade on core 3 was higher for apical lesions (p = .01) and lesions with a higher PI-RADS score (p = .01). Sampling of a second lesion resulted in an upgrade in a single patient (2.5%; 1/40); both lesions were PI-RADS category 4 and showed csPCa. CONCLUSION. When performing in-gantry MRGB of the prostate, obtaining three cores from the primary lesion is warranted to optimize csPCa diagnosis. Obtaining a fourth core from the primary lesion or sampling a second lesion has very low yield in upgrading cancer diagnoses. CLINICAL IMPACT. To reduce patient discomfort and procedure times, operators may refrain from obtaining more than three cores or second lesion sampling.""","""['Nicole Seyfried', 'Amr Mahran', 'Ananya Panda', 'Verena C Obmann', 'Christina A Buzzy', 'Yun Jiang', 'Katherine L Wright', 'Dean A Nakamoto', 'Indravadan J Patel', 'Britt Conroy', 'Lee Ponsky', 'Vikas Gulani']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""AJR Am J Roentgenol""","""['Editorial Comment: In-Gantry MRI-Guided Prostate Biopsy-How Many Cores Are Enough?', 'Targeted MRI-guided prostate biopsy: are two biopsy cores per MRI-lesion required?', 'Optimizing the Number of Cores Targeted During Prostate Magnetic Resonance Imaging Fusion Target Biopsy.', 'Head-to-head Comparison of Transrectal Ultrasound-guided Prostate Biopsy Versus Multiparametric Prostate Resonance Imaging with Subsequent Magnetic Resonance-guided Biopsy in Biopsy-naïve Men with Elevated Prostate-specific Antigen: A Large Prospective Multicenter Clinical Study.', 'Prostate Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Magnetic Resonance Imaging Targeted Biopsy in Patients with a Prior Negative Biopsy: A Consensus Statement by AUA and SAR.', 'MRI-guided in-bore biopsy for prostate cancer: what does the evidence say?

However, not all patients benefit from this therapy. Different treatment responses could be explained by tumor heterogeneity triggered by progression and the number of prior treatments. PSMA-negative lesions can be missed on PSMA ligand PET/CT, which subsequently results in an underestimation of tumor burden. Conversely, high FDG uptake may also be an indicator of tumor aggressiveness and thus a poor prognostic marker for response to RLT and overall survival (OS). The aim of this analysis was to investigate the prognostic value of combined PSMA ligand PET/CT and [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET/CT for outcome prediction in patients undergoing RLT.  Materials and methods:   This bicentric analysis included 54 patients with mCRPC who underwent both FDG and PSMA ligand PET/CT imaging before RLT. In all patients, the pattern of PSMA ligand and FDG uptake was visually assessed. Patients with at least one FDG-positive, but PSMA-negative (FDG+/PSMA-) lesions were compared to patients without any FDG+/PSMA- lesions. A log-rank analysis was used to assess the difference in OS between subgroups.  Results:   Median OS was 11 ± 1.8 months (95% CI 7.4-14.6). A significantly lower OS (p < 0.001) was found in patients with at least one FDG+/PSMA- lesion at baseline PET/CTs (n = 18) with a median OS of 6.0 ± 0.5 months (95% CI: 5.0-7.0 months). In comparison, patients without any FDG+/PSMA- lesions (n = 36) had a median OS of 16.0 ± 2.5 months (95% CI: 11.2-20.8 months).

This justifies the need for efficient early diagnostic methods and novel therapies, particularly radiopharmaceuticals with the potential for simultaneous diagnosis and therapy (theranostics). We have previously demonstrated, using monolayer-cultured cells, that copper-64 chloride, a promising theranostic agent for PCa, has the potential to induce significant damage in cancer cells while having minimal side effects in healthy tissues. Here, we further explored this compound for its theranostic applications using more advanced PCa cellular models, specifically multicellular spheroids. Namely, we evaluated the cellular uptake of 64CuCl2 in three human PCa spheroids (derived from 22RV1, DU145, and LNCaP cells), and characterized the growth profile and viability of those spheroids as well as the clonogenic capacity of spheroid-derived cells after exposure to 64CuCl2. Furthermore, the populations of cancer stem cells (CSCs), known to be important for cancer resistance and recurrence, present in the spheroid models were also evaluated using two different markers (CD44 and CD117). 64CuCl2 was found to have significant detrimental effects in spheroids and spheroid-derived cells, being able to reduce their growth and impair the viability and reproductive ability of spheroids from both castration-resistant (22RV1 and DU145) and hormone-naïve PCa (LNCaP). Interestingly, resistance to 64CuCl2 treatment seemed to be related with the presence of a CSC population, since the most resistant spheroids, derived from the DU145 cell line, had the highest initial percentage of CSCs among the three cell lines under study. Altogether, these results clearly highlight the theranostic potential of 64CuCl2.""","""['Catarina I G Pinto', 'Sara Bucar', 'Vítor Alves', 'Alexandra Fonseca', 'Antero J Abrunhosa', 'Cláudia L da Silva', 'Joana F Guerreiro', 'Filipa Mendes']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Front Mol Biosci""","""['Evaluation of the effect of hyperthermia and electron radiation on prostate cancer stem cells.', 'Differential effect of grape seed extract and its active constituent procyanidin B2 3,3″-di-O-gallate against prostate cancer stem cells.', 'Expression profiling of stem cell signaling alters with spheroid formation in CD133high/CD44high prostate cancer stem cells.', 'Tumor-derived spheroids: Relevance to cancer stem cells and clinical applications.', 'The evolving landscape of prostate cancer stem cell: Therapeutic implications and future challenges.', 'Modifications in cellular viability, DNA damage and stress responses inflicted in cancer cells by copper-64 ions.', ""Let's Go 3D!

So far, there have been no reports attempting to more comprehensively profile the landscape of prostate cancer-associated antibodies. Specifically, it is unknown whether the quantity of antibodies or the types of proteins recognized change with disease progression.  Methods:   A peptide microarray spanning the amino acid sequences of the gene products of 1611 prostate cancer-associated genes was synthesized. Serum samples from healthy male volunteers (n=15) and patients with prostate cancer (n=85) were used to probe the array. These samples included patients with various clinical stages of disease: newly diagnosed localized prostate cancer (n=15), castration-sensitive non-metastatic prostate cancer (nmCSPC, n=40), castration-resistant non-metastatic prostate cancer (n=15) and castration-resistant metastatic disease (n=15). The patients with nmCSPC received treatment with either standard androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) or an antitumor DNA vaccine encoding prostatic acid phosphatase. Serial sera samples from these individuals were also used to probe the array, to secondarily determine whether this approach could be used to detect treatment-related changes.  Results:   We demonstrated that this peptide array yielded highly reproducible measurements of serum IgG levels. We found that the overall number of antibody responses did not increase with disease burden. However, the composition of recognized proteins shifted with clinical stage of disease. Our analysis revealed that the largest difference was between patients with castration-sensitive and castration-resistant disease. Patients with castration-resistant disease recognized more proteins associated with nucleic acid binding and gene regulation compared with men in other groups. Our longitudinal data showed that treatments can elicit antibodies detectable by this array, and notably vaccine-treated patients developed increased responses to more proteins over the course of treatment than did ADT-treated patients.  Conclusions:   This study represents the largest survey of prostate cancer-associated antibodies to date. We have been able to characterize the classes of proteins recognized by patients and determine how they change with disease burden. Our findings further demonstrate the potential of this platform for measuring antigen spread and studying responses to immunomodulatory therapies.""","""['Hemanth K Potluri', 'Tun Lee Ng', 'Michael A Newton', 'Jin Zhang', 'Christopher A Maher', 'Peter S Nelson', 'Douglas G McNeel']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""J Immunother Cancer""","""['Anticancer Activity and Tolerance of Treatments Received Beyond Progression in Men Treated Upfront with Androgen Deprivation Therapy With or Without Docetaxel for Metastatic Castration-naïve Prostate Cancer in the GETUG-AFU 15 Phase 3 Trial.', 'Intraprostatic androgens and androgen-regulated gene expression persist after testosterone suppression: therapeutic implications for castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Timing of androgen deprivation monotherapy and combined treatments in castration-sensitive and castration-resistant prostate cancer: a narrative review.', 'Differences in time to disease progression do not predict for cancer-specific survival in patients receiving immediate or deferred androgen-deprivation therapy for prostate cancer: final results of EORTC randomized trial 30891 with 12 years of follow-up.', 'Treating Patients with Metastatic Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer: A Comprehensive Review of Available Therapies.', 'Prostate cancer autoantibodies - applications in diagnosis, prognosis, monitoring disease progression and immunotherapy.', 'Antibody landscape of C57BL/6 mice cured of B78 melanoma via immunotherapy.', 'Applications of Peptide Microarrays in Autoantibody, Infection, and Cancer Detection.', 'Emerging Proteins in CRPC: Functional Roles and Clinical Implications.', 'GM-CSF elicits antibodies to tumor-associated proteins when used as a prostate cancer vaccine adjuvant.']"""

Although PARP inhibitors (PARPis) have been shown to benefit men with mCRPC harboring DDR defects due to mutations in BRCA1/2 and ATM, additional treatments are necessary because the effects are not durable.  Experimental design:   We performed transcriptomic analysis of publicly available mCRPC cases, comparing BRCA2 null with BRCA2 wild-type. We generated BRCA2-null prostate cancer cells using CRISPR/Cas9 and treated these cells with PARPis and SRC inhibitors. We also assessed the antiproliferative effects of combination treatment in 3D prostate cancer organoids.  Results:   We observed significant enrichment of the SRC signaling pathway in BRCA2-altered mCRPC. BRCA2-null prostate cancer cell lines had increased SRC phosphorylation and higher sensitivity to SRC inhibitors (e.g., dasatinib, bosutinib, and saracatinib) relative to wild-type cells. Combination treatment with PARPis and SRC inhibitors was antiproliferative and had a synergistic effect in BRCA2-null prostate cancer cells, mCRPC organoids, and Trp53/Rb1-null prostate cancer cells. Inhibition of SRC signaling by dasatinib augmented DNA damage in BRCA2-null prostate cancer cells. Moreover, SRC knockdown increased PARPi sensitivity in BRCA2-null prostate cancer cells.  Conclusions:   This work suggests that SRC activation may be a potential mechanism of PARPi resistance and that treatment with SRC inhibitors may overcome this resistance. Our preclinical study demonstrates that combining PARPis and SRC inhibitors may be a promising therapeutic strategy for patients with BRCA2-null mCRPC.""","""['Goutam Chakraborty#', 'Nabeela Khan Patail#', 'Rahim Hirani', 'Subhiksha Nandakumar', 'Ying Z Mazzu', 'Yuki Yoshikawa', 'Mohammad Atiq', 'Lina E Jehane', 'Konrad H Stopsack', 'Gwo-Shu Mary Lee', 'Wassim Abida', 'Michael J Morris', 'Lorelei A Mucci', 'Daniel Danila', 'Philip W Kantoff']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Clin Cancer Res""","""['Differential Activity of PARP Inhibitors in BRCA1- Versus BRCA2-Altered Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Differential responses to taxanes and PARP inhibitors in ATM-\xa0versus BRCA2-mutated metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Androgen receptor inhibitor-induced ""BRCAness"" and PARP inhibition are synthetically lethal for castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'DNA-Damage-Repair Gene Alterations in Genitourinary Malignancies.', 'Clinical Development of PARP Inhibitors in Treating Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'A review on genetic alterations in CNS metastases related to breast cancer treatment.

Longitudinal projections of trends and outcomes, including mortality, post-procedural complications, length of stay, disposition, and total hospital charges were analyzed.  Results:   Following a period of decreased utilization from 2008 to 2012, hospitalizations for vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty plateaued after 2013.

Thus we investigated anti-cancer effects of M1-polarized macrophages by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) on the physiological properties of human prostate cancer PC-3 cells. To identify communications with immune cells and tumor cells, we performed in-direct way by using conditioned-media (CM) and analyzed tumor properties via quantitative polymerase chain reaction, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and western blot and flow cytometry. CM of M1-polarized macrophages induced apoptotic cell death in PC-3 cells, and it surprisingly suppressed tumor parameters including epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT), invasion, migration and angiogenesis. EMT specific markers, N-cadherin, snail-1, and TGF β2 were diminished; however, E-cadherin was increased. In addition, migration markers, vimentin and CCL2 were down-regulated, and finally wound healing was also inhibited. Decreased expression of matrix metalloprotein (MMP)-9 and VEGFA might reduce the invasive and angiogenic abilities of PC-3 cells. These results suggested that co-culture with CM of M1-polarized macrophages showed higher anti-cancer effects on PC-3 cells.

Methods:   Questionnaire surveys were sent to 179 GPs in the north-east of the Netherlands, of which 65 (36%) were completed and returned. We also surveyed 23 GPs attending a postgraduate train-the-trainer day (100%). In addition to demographic data and practice characteristics, the 31-item questionnaire covered the attitudes, clinical practice, adherence to PSA screening recommendations, and knowledge concerning the recommendations for prostate cancer early detection. Statistical analysis was limited to the descriptive level.  Results:   Most GPs (95%; n = 82) stated that they had at least read the Dutch GP guideline, but just half (50%; n = 43) also stated that they knew the content. Almost half (46%; n = 39) stated they would offer detailed counseling before ordering a PSA test to an asymptomatic man requesting a test. Overall, prostate cancer screening was reported to be of minor importance compared to other types of cancer screening.

The role of stroma during disease progression is insufficiently defined. Using transcriptomic and proteomic analyses on differentially aggressive patient-derived xenografts (PDXs), we investigated whether PCa tumors predispose their microenvironment (stroma) to a metastatic gene expression pattern. RNA sequencing was performed on the PCa PDXs BM18 (castration-sensitive) and LAPC9 (castration-resistant), representing different disease stages. Using organism-specific reference databases, the human-specific transcriptome (tumor) was identified and separated from the mouse-specific transcriptome (stroma). To identify proteomic changes in the tumor (human) versus the stroma (mouse), we performed human/mouse cell separation and subjected protein lysates to quantitative Tandem Mass Tag labeling and mass spectrometry. Tenascin C (TNC) was among the most abundant stromal genes, modulated by androgen levels in vivo and highly expressed in castration-resistant LAPC9 PDX. The tissue microarray of primary PCa samples (n = 210) showed that TNC is a negative prognostic marker of the clinical progression to recurrence or metastasis. Stroma markers of osteoblastic PCa bone metastases seven-up signature were induced in the stroma by the host organism in metastatic xenografts, indicating conserved mechanisms of tumor cells to induce a stromal premetastatic signature.

Methods: The imaging data of 159 patients with major prostate lesions located in the transitional zone collected by the Department of Radiology of the Second Affiliated Hospital of Suzhou University from January to December 2017 were retrospectively analyzed. Two radiologists used PI-RADS V2.1 and V2 scoring system respectively to perform diagnostic scores on the enrolled cases. The weighted Kappa test was used to evaluate the consistency of PI-RADS V2.1 and V2 scores between the two radiologists. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to evaluate and compare the diagnostic efficiency of two radiologists using two scoring systems for transitional zone prostate cancer (PCa) and clinically significant PCa (csPCa). Results: The weighted Kappa values between the scores of all lesions, benign lesions, PCa lesions, and csPCa lesions by the two radiologists using PI-RADS V2.1 and V2 scoring systems were 0.754, 0.643, 0.734, 0.782 and 0.808, 0.738, 0.775, 0.826, respectively. The PI-RADS V2.1 scoring system had a better consistency. There were no statistically significant differences in sensitivity, specificity, area under the ROC curve (AUC) between the PI-RADS V2.1 and V2 scoring system for PCa and csPCa (all P>0.05). However, in this set of data, the sensitivity and AUC value of PI-RADS V2.1 scoring system in diagnosing PCa and csPCa were higher than those of P-RADS V2. The diagnostic sensitivity of PI-RADS V2.1 and V2 for PCa were 86.7% and 80.0%, the diagnostic sensitivity for csPCa were 94.4% and 88.9%, the diagnostic AUC for PCa were 0.857 and 0.816, and the diagnostic AUC of csPCa were 0.917 and 0.886, respectively.

Currently, an important goal is to preserve quality of life during and after treatment. The relationship between the radiation a patient receives and the subsequent side effects he experiences is complex and difficult to model or predict. Here, we use machine learning algorithms and statistical models to explore the connection between radiation treatment and post-treatment gastro-urinary function. Since only a limited number of patient datasets are currently available, we used image flipping and curvature-based interpolation methods to generate more data to leverage transfer learning. Using interpolated and augmented data, we trained a convolutional autoencoder network to obtain near-optimal starting points for the weights. A convolutional neural network then analyzed the relationship between patient-reported quality-of-life and radiation doses to the bladder and rectum. We also used analysis of variance and logistic regression to explore organ sensitivity to radiation and to develop dosage thresholds for each organ region. Our findings show no statistically significant association between the bladder and quality-of-life scores. However, we found a statistically significant association between the radiation applied to posterior and anterior rectal regions and changes in quality of life. Finally, we estimated radiation therapy dose thresholds for each organ.

CA19-9 is an established circulating biomarker for pancreatic cancer; however, its relevance for pancreatic cancer early detection or for monitoring subjects at risk has not been established.  Methods:   CA19-9 levels were assessed in blinded sera from 175 subjects collected up to 5 years before diagnosis of pancreatic cancer and from 875 matched controls from the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer Screening Trial. For comparison of performance, CA19-9 was assayed in blinded independent sets of samples collected at diagnosis from 129 subjects with resectable pancreatic cancer and 275 controls (100 healthy subjects; 50 with chronic pancreatitis; and 125 with noncancerous pancreatic cysts). The complementary value of 2 additional protein markers, TIMP1 and LRG1, was determined.  Results:   In the PLCO cohort, levels of CA19-9 increased exponentially starting at 2 years before diagnosis with sensitivities reaching 60% at 99% specificity within 0 to 6 months before diagnosis for all cases and 50% at 99% specificity for cases diagnosed with early-stage disease. Performance was comparable for distinguishing newly diagnosed cases with resectable pancreatic cancer from healthy controls (64% sensitivity at 99% specificity). Comparison of resectable pancreatic cancer cases to subjects with chronic pancreatitis yielded 46% sensitivity at 99% specificity and for subjects with noncancerous cysts, 30% sensitivity at 99% specificity. For prediagnostic cases below cutoff value for CA19-9, the combination with LRG1 and TIMP1 yielded an increment of 13.2% in sensitivity at 99% specificity (P = .031) in identifying cases diagnosed within 1 year of blood collection.

According to the UPLC-Q-TOF-MS/MS analysis and comparison with standards, the fourth fraction of peanut skin procyanidin (PSP-4) was identified as procyanidin A-type dimers, namely, procyanidin A1 and A2. Results revealed that PSP-4 treatment prior H2O2 exposure increased cell activity and attenuated the cell cycle arrest and apoptosis rate. The H2O2-induced increase in intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) was remarkably inhibited by PSP-4. PSP-4 treatment enhanced the activity of catalase (CAT) and total super oxide dismutase (T-SOD) and restored glutathione (GSH) content, compared with the H2O2 treatment. Furthermore, the results indicated that PSP-4 protected DU145 cells by attenuating phosphorylation of the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), by increasing the Bcl-2/Bax ratio, and by reducing the activation of caspase-3 and caspase-9 by cascade reactions.

These interventions are often supported by economic decision frameworks, which do not account for the role of emotions in treatment decisions. In some instances, emotion-driven decisions can override an individual's cognitive evaluation of a decision, leading to unfavorable outcomes such as decision regret.  Objectives:   To produce a Prostate Cancer Treatment Decision Framework based on the Risk-as-Feelings Hypothesis.  Methods:   The authors reviewed seminal research in emotion and decision-making in an effort to create a context-specific decision framework.  Results:   Five variables, not germane to the Risk-as-Feelings Hypothesis, play prominent roles in PrCA decision-making including age, spirituality, family support, healthcare provider communication, and perception of treatment outcomes. While family support only affects decision outcomes by influencing emotion and cognitive evaluation of a PrCA decision, age, spirituality, and healthcare provider communication can have direct effects on an individual's perception of treatment outcomes.  Conclusions:   The Prostate Cancer Treatment Decision Framework combines new variables with older models to explain the PrCA treatment decision-making process and elucidate relationships affecting treatment outcomes and survivors' perceptions of these outcomes. The core premise of this model can be applied to other high-risk health decisions.  Implications for practice:   Healthcare providers have the greatest influence on PrCA treatment decision-making. Using a shared decision-making approach, providers should take into account a patient's personal characteristics and values, in addition to clinical presentation, to help patients with treatment decisions.""","""['Otis L Owens', 'Robin M Dawson', 'Tracey Thomas']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Cancer Nurs""","""[""'I'm not a chance taker': A mixed methods exploration of factors affecting prostate cancer treatment decision-making."", 'Perceptions of Urologists About the Conversational Elements Leading to Treatment Decision-Making Among Newly Diagnosed Prostate Cancer Patients.', 'Changes in decisional conflict and decisional regret in patients with localised prostate cancer.', 'Decision aids for people facing health treatment or screening decisions.', 'Personalised risk communication for informed decision making about taking screening tests.']"""

Defining the mechanisms regulating AR nuclear localization in androgen-sensitive cells and how these mechanisms are dysregulated in castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) cells is fundamentally important and clinically relevant. According to the classical model of AR intracellular trafficking, androgens induce AR nuclear import and androgen withdrawal causes AR nuclear export. The present study has led to an updated model that AR could be imported in the absence of androgens, ubiquitinated, and degraded in the nucleus. Androgen withdrawal caused nuclear AR degradation, but not export. In comparison with their parental androgen-sensitive LNCaP prostate cancer cells, castration-resistant C4-2 cells exhibited reduced nuclear AR polyubiquitination and increased nuclear AR level. We previously identified 3-(4-chlorophenyl)-6,7-dihydro-5H-pyrrolo[1,2-a]imidazole (CPPI) in a high-throughput screen for its inhibition of androgen-independent AR nuclear localization in CRPC cells. The current study shows that CPPI is a competitive AR antagonist capable of enhancing AR interaction with its E3 ligase MDM2 and degradation of AR in the nuclei of CRPC cells. Also, CPPI blocked androgen-independent AR nuclear import.

Overall, 90 patients developed confirmed ONJ, with cumulative incidence of 0.8% (95% CI, 0.5%-1.1%) at year 1, 2.0% (95% CI, 1.5%-2.5%) at year 2, and 2.8% (95% CI, 2.3%-3.5%) at year 3; 3-year cumulative incidence was highest in patients with myeloma (4.3%; 95% CI, 2.8%-6.4%). Patients with planned zoledronic acid dosing intervals of less than 5 weeks were more likely to experience ONJ than patients with planned dosing intervals of 5 weeks or more (hazard ratio [HR], 4.65; 95% CI, 1.46-14.81; P = .009). A higher rate of ONJ was associated with fewer total number of teeth (HR, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.31-0.83; P = .006), the presence of dentures (HR, 1.83; 95% CI, 1.10-3.03; P = .02), and current smoking (HR, 2.12; 95% CI, 1.12-4.02; P = .02).  Conclusions and relevance:   As the findings show, the cumulative incidence of ONJ after 3 years was 2.8% in patients receiving zoledronic acid for MBD. Cancer type, oral health, and frequency of dosing were associated with the risk of ONJ. These data provide information to guide stratification of risk for developing ONJ in patients with MBD receiving zoledronic acid.""","""['Catherine H Van Poznak', 'Joseph M Unger', 'Amy K Darke', 'Carol Moinpour', 'Robert A Bagramian', 'Mark M Schubert', 'Lisa Kathryn Hansen', 'Justin D Floyd', 'Shaker R Dakhil', 'Danika L Lew', 'James Lloyd Wade rd', 'Michael J Fisch', 'N Lynn Henry', 'Dawn L Hershman', 'Julie Gralow']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""JAMA Oncol""","""['Osteonecrosis of the jaw in cancer after treatment with bisphosphonates: incidence and risk factors.', 'Osteonecrosis of the jaw among patients with cancer treated with denosumab or zoledronic acid: Results of a regulator-mandated cohort postauthorization safety study in Denmark, Norway, and Sweden.', 'Osteonecrosis of the jaw in patients with multiple myeloma during and after treatment with zoledronic acid.', 'Osteonecrosis of the Jaw in Patients Receiving Bone-Targeted Therapies: An Overview--Part I.', 'Osteonecrosis of the jaw in cancer patients receiving IV bisphosphonates.', 'Management of bone metastasis with zoledronic acid: A systematic review and Bayesian network meta-analysis.', 'Lactate as a myokine and exerkine: drivers and signals of physiology and metabolism.', 'Incidence and Risk of Anti-Resorptive Agent-Related Osteonecrosis of the Jaw after Tooth Extraction: A Retrospective Study.', 'Investigation of the Antiangiogenic Properties of Zoledronic Acid by Using Chorioallantoic Membrane Model.', 'Osteonecrosis of the Jaw and Antiresorptive Agents in Benign and Malignant Diseases: A Critical Review Organized by the ECTS.']"""

The synthesized nanoconjugate drug (NCD) was then loaded on graphene oxide (GO) as drug carrier by simple ultrasonication method and thoroughly characterized by various spectroscopic techniques (FT-IR, SEM, TEM, XRD, EPR and thermogravimetric analysis) which revealed the successful loading of the nanoconjugate drug on GO. The UV-visible, fluorescence and electrochemical studies suggested that strong π-π stacking interactions exist between nanoconjugate drug and GO. The binding studies of NCD-GO with ct-DNA were performed by various optical and biophysical methods viz., UV-visible, fluorescence, circular dichroism (CD) and cyclic voltammetry (CV) which indicated electrostatic mode of binding towards the ct-DNA. Furthermore, condensate of nanoconjugate drug-loaded GO (NCD-GO) with ct-DNA was prepared and analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) which revealed that the interaction of NCD-GO with ct-DNA had occurred. Cleavage activity of NCD-GO with pBR322 was evaluated by gel electrophoresis and it was found that NCD-GO cleave DNA through hydrolytic pathway involving hydroxyl radical (OH). The cytotoxicity of NCD-GO was evaluated against human liver carcinoma (Huh-7), prostate cancer (Du-145) cell lines along with normal cell line (PNT 2). The results obtained showed selective cytotoxic activity of NCD-GO against Du-145 cell lines. The intracellular uptake was visualized by confocal microscopy which revealed the significant cellular uptake and internalization of nanoparticles by cells.

We added information from SK & A surveys and extensive internet searches to assign a practice structure to each urologist-year (2005-2014). Horizontal integration among small urology groups led to a sharp increase in the proportion of urologists who belong to large urology practices with ownership in intensity modulated radiation therapy and/or anatomical pathology services. By 2014, more than half of New Jersey urologists and about 43% of urologists in Florida and Texas were members of such large practices, whereas small percentages (7%-16%) were employed by a health system. In contrast, more than 27% of California urologists were employed but only 17.5% had ownership in intensity modulated radiation therapy and/or pathology services.

We therefore explored signs of direct or indirect tumour-tumour interactions in experimental models and patient samples. Low-metastatic AT1 and high-metastatic MatLyLu (MLL) Dunning rat prostate cancer cells were injected into separate lobes of the ventral prostate of immunocompetent rats. AT1 tumours growing in the same prostate as MLL tumours had increased tumour size and proliferation compared to AT1 tumours growing alone. In addition, the vasculature and macrophage density surrounding the AT1 tumours were increased by MLL tumour closeness. In patient prostatectomy samples, selected to contain an index tumour [tumour with the highest grade, International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) grade 1, 2, 3 or 4] and a low-grade satellite tumour (ISUP grade 1), cell proliferation in low-grade satellite tumours gradually increased with increasing histological grade of the index tumour. The density of blood vessels and CD68+ macrophages also increased around the low-grade satellite tumour if a high-grade index tumour was present. This suggests that high-grade tumours, by changing the prostate microenvironment, may increase the aggressiveness of low-grade lesions in the organ.

TRIB1 regulates polarization of macrophages and dysregulated Trib1 expression in murine models has been shown to alter atherosclerosis burden and adipose homeostasis. Recently, TRIB1 has also been implicated in the pathogenesis of prostate cancer, where it is often overexpressed, even in the absence of genetic amplification. Well described TRIB1 effectors include MAP kinases and C/EBP transcription factors, both in immune cells and in carcinogenesis. However, the mechanisms that regulate TRIB1 itself remain elusive. Here, we show that the long and conserved 3'untranslated region (3'UTR) of TRIB1 is targeted by miRNAs in macrophage and prostate cancer models. By using a systematic in silico analysis, we identified multiple ""high confidence"" miRNAs potentially binding to the 3'UTR of TRIB1 and report that miR-101-3p and miR-132-3p are direct regulators of TRIB1 expression and function. Binding of miR-101-3p and miR-132-3p to the 3'UTR of TRIB1 mRNA leads to an increased transcription and secretion of interleukin-8.

In this study, RNA-Seq data from patients with PCa and controls were downloaded from the FIREBROWSE database, and it was found that the GTSE1 mRNA level was significantly upregulated in PCa.

In addition, overexpression of GTSE1 could promote proliferation in LNCaP cells, whereas silencing GTSE1 could inhibit the growth of C4-2 cells in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, GTSE1 enhanced the expression of FOXM1 by upregulating the SP1 protein level, a transcription factor of FOXM1, which ultimately promoted PCa cell proliferation.

We examined the effects of a 12-week exercise programme comprising resistance, aerobic and flexibility training on sexual health and function in men with advanced prostate cancer.  Methods:   Patients with prostate cancer (70.0±8.4 year; body mass index 28.7±4.0 kg/m2) with bone metastases (rib/thoracic spine, 66.7%; lumbar spine, 43.9%; pelvis, 75.4%; femur, 40.4%; humerus, 24.6%; other sites, 70.2%) were randomly assigned to supervised exercise 3 days/week (n=28) or usual care (n=29).

The utilization of ADT increased from more than 7,000 person-time in 2008 to more than 50,000 person-time in 2014. Cyproterone acetate was the most commonly used drug in 2008-2015, but its proportion of utilization, which was the highest in stage 2 cancer, dropped from 43% in 2008 to 15% in 2015. Bicalutamide was the second most used drug from 2008 to 2015, but its utilization was not different for different stages.The incidence rate of prostate cancer increased in the study period and medical expenditure also increased in ADT treatment.

Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) is a technique to administer high doses with great precision, which is commonly performed with CyberKnife (CK) in prostate cancer treatment. Since the CyberKnife (CK) is not available at all radiotherapy center, alternative SBRT techniques are available such as Volumetric Modulated Arc Therapy (VMAT) and Helical Tomotherapy (HT). The aim of the present study was to compare the dosimetric differences between the CK, VMAT, and HT plans for localized prostate cancer treatment.Seventeenpatients have been recruited and replanned using VMAT and HT to this purpose: they received the treatment using the CK with a prescription of 36.25 Gy in 5 fractions; bladder, rectum and penis bulb were considered as organs at risk (OAR). In order to compare the techniques, we considered DVHs, PTV coverage, Conformity Index and new Conformity Index, Homogeneity Index, beam-on time and OARs received dose.The 3 treatments methods showed a comparable coverage of the lesion (PTV 95%: 99.8 ± 0.4% CK; 98.5 ± 0.8% VMAT; 99.4 ± 0.5% HT.

Methods:   Using Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results data linked with Medicare claims and CAHPS surveys, we identified men aged 65-84 diagnosed with localized prostate cancer from 2004 to 2013 and ascertained their National Cancer Institute (NCI) comorbidity score and patient-reported health status. Adjusting for demographics and cancer risk, we examined the relationship between these measures and treatment for the overall cohort, low-risk men aged 65-74, intermediate/high-risk men aged 65-74, and men aged 75-84.  Results:   Among 2724 men, 43.0% rated their overall health as Excellent/Very Good, while 62.7% had a comorbidity score of 0. Beyond age and cancer risk, patient-reported health status was significantly associated with treatment. Compared to men reporting Excellent/Very Good health, men in Poor/Fair health less often received treatment (odds ratio [OR] 0.71, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.56-0.90). Younger men with intermediate/high-risk cancer in Good (OR 0.60, 95% CI 0.41-0.88) or Fair/Poor (OR 0.49, 95% CI 0.30-0.79) health less often underwent prostatectomy vs radiation compared to men in Excellent/Very Good health. In contrast, men with NCI comorbidity score of 1 more often received treatment (OR 1.37, 95% CI 1.11-1.70) compared to men with NCI comorbidity score of 0.

It is unknown if immigrants who die from cancer in Ontario spend less time at home near the end of life. Objective: Compare the number of days at home (DAH) in the last six months of life for immigrants and long-term residents (LTRs) who die from cancer. Methods: Population-based cohort study (January 1, 2005 to December 31, 2013) using administrative databases. Participants were adults (≥18 years) who died from cancer in Ontario. Immigrants were defined as those who immigrated from 1985 onward. The outcome was DAH in the last six months of life. Analysis included univariate and multivariable regression, adjusting for patient and disease characteristics. Subgroup analyses assessed DAH by immigration class, time since immigration, and region of birth. Sensitivity analyses excluded patients with breast and prostate cancer to examine for sex differences. Results: Seventy-two thousand nine hundred eighty-eight individuals (3988 immigrants) were identified. Immigrants spent fewer DAH in the last six months (unadjusted 162 days vs. 164 days, p < 0.001). This remained statistically significant after adjusting (p = 0.0087). DAH varied by immigration class and region of birth. Sensitivity analyses suggest a sex difference in end-of-life time spent at home. Conclusions: Immigrants who die from cancer in Ontario spend fewer DAH before death than LTRs.

People with mobility disability experience healthcare disparities, including lower rates of cancer screening and substandard cancer care compared with nondisabled people. We explored clinicians' reports of aspects of diagnosing and treating three common cancer types among persons with pre-existing mobility disability.  Methods:   We used standard diagnosis codes and natural language processing to screen electronic health records (EHR) in the Research Patient Data Repository for patients with pre-existing chronic mobility impairment who were newly diagnosed with one of three common cancers (colorectal, prostate, and non-Hodgkin lymphoma) between 2005 and 2017. We eliminated numerous cases whose EHRs lacked essential information. We reviewed EHRs of 27 cases, using conventional content analysis to identify themes concerning their cancer diagnoses and treatments.  Results:   Clinicians' notations coalesced around four major themes: (1) patients' health risks raise concerns about diagnostic processes; (2) cancer signs or symptoms can be erroneously attributed to the patient's underlying disabling condition, delaying diagnosis; (3) disability complicates cancer treatment decisions; and (4) problems with equipment accessibility and disability accommodations impede cancer diagnoses.  Discussion:   Clinicians view patients with pre-existing mobility disability as often clinically complex, presenting challenges for diagnosing and treating their cancer. Nonetheless, these patients may experience substandard care because of disability-related problems. Given the growing population of people with mobility disability, further efforts to improve care quality and timeliness of diagnosis are warranted.""","""['Nicole D Agaronnik', 'Areej El-Jawahri', 'Charlotta Lindvall', 'Lisa I Iezzoni']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""JCO Oncol Pract""","""['Perspectives of Patients with Pre-existing Mobility Disability on the Process of Diagnosing Their Cancer.', 'Challenges of Developing a Natural Language Processing Method With Electronic Health Records to Identify Persons With Chronic Mobility Disability.', 'Exploring attitudes about developing cancer among patients with pre-existing mobility disability.', 'Peripheral Arterial Disease – Diagnosis and Treatment: A Systematic Review Internet.', 'Barriers to cancer screening for people with disabilities: a literature review.']"""

Results:   Of the total number of cases of PCa diagnosed and treated, there were 291 in 2010, 315 in 2011, 213 in 2012, 220 in 2013, 159 in 2014, 226 in 2015, 199 in 2016, 180 in 2017, 577 in 2018 and 497 in 2019. The age-related incidence rate was the lowest in the <40-year-olds (1.77%) and the highest in the 65- to 79-year-olds (18.4%). The incidence rate was increased year by year in the 65- to 79-year-olds, elevated to 63.9% in the 10 years, and most significantly in the ≥80-year-olds, soaring to 97.9% in the 10 years. As for the pathological types, prostatic adenocarcinoma (PAC) accounted for 50.1% (n = 1 441), acinar cell PAC 7.0% (n = 201), follicular PAC 1.29% (n = 37), ductal PCa 0.94% (n = 27), non-specific PCa 9.49% (n = 273), and other PACs 5.77% (n = 166). TCM syndrome differentiation was performed for 157 cases, which revealed kidney-yin deficiency in 40 cases (25.5%) and kidney-yang deficiency in 69 cases (43.9%).  Conclusions:   The incidence of PCa from 2010 to 2019 showed an aging-related trend in the Changsha area of Hunan Province, the highest among 65- to 69-year-olds. Males aged 65－79 years are a high-risk population for PCa, which calls for strengthened health education, early diagnosis and early treatment.""","""['Rui-Song Gao', 'Qing Zhou', 'Xiao-Bo Zhang', 'Pu-Hua Zeng', 'Xue-Fei Tian', 'Yan Long', 'Yi Shu', 'Xin-Jun Luo']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Zhonghua Nan Ke Xue""","""['Distribution of traditional Chinese medicine syndrome types of male infertility in Chengdu area.', 'Epidemiological characteristics and spatial epidemiology of hand-foot-mouth disease in Hunan Province, China, from 2008 to 2019.', 'A multi-centeric epidemiological survey on TCM syndrome in 1016 patients with IgA nephropathy and analysis of its relevant factors.', 'Epidemiology and Prevention of Prostate Cancer.', ""Prostate cancer treatment - China's perspective.""]"""

Research with other populations with cancer indicates that cognitive impairment may also occur before systemic treatment. The authors assessed cognitive impairment in untreated PCPs referred to ADT and explored associations with structural brain networks, endocrine status, and selected genotypes.  Methods:   Forty untreated PCPs and 27 healthy controls (HCs) who completed a questionnaire package underwent neuropsychological testing, magnetic resonance imaging, and blood sampling. Cognitive impairment was defined as a z score ≤-2 on 1 neuropsychological test or ≤-1.5 on 2 neuropsychological tests. Structural brain networks were investigated using diffusion-weighted imaging and graph theory. Associations of cognitive performance with patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs), brain networks, testosterone levels, and genotypes (apolipoprotein ε [APOE], catechol-O-methyltransferase [COMT], and brain-derived neurotrophic factor [BDNF]) were explored.  Results:   PCPs performed poorer than HCs on 7 of 15 neuropsychological tests and exhibited a higher frequency of cognitive impairment (57.5% vs 22.2%; P ≤ .01 to .03). All neuropsychological outcomes were associated with ≥1 PROM (P ≤ .01 to .04). Compared with the HC group, the PCP group exhibited altered global network organization as well as disrupted regional network characteristics in frontal and temporal regions (P < .01). PCPs had lower testosterone levels (P < .01) than HCs, which correlated with better visuospatial performance (r = -0.33; P = .04). No effects were found of APOE, COMT, or BDNF.  Conclusions:   The current results suggest that untreated PCPs may demonstrate cognitive impairment and that psychological and behavioral symptoms (PROMs), as well as impairment in structural brain networks, might be the underlying mechanisms.""","""['Cecilie R Buskbjerg', 'Robert Zachariae', 'Simon Buus', 'Claus H Gravholt', 'Lene Haldbo-Classen', 'S M Hadi Hosseini', 'Ali Amidi']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Cancer""","""['Androgen deprivation therapy and cognitive decline-associations with brain connectomes, endocrine status, and risk genotypes.', 'Cognitive impairment and associations with structural brain networks, endocrine status, and risk genotypes in newly orchiectomized testicular cancer patients.', 'Cognitive changes and brain connectomes, endocrine status, and risk genotypes in testicular cancer patients-A prospective controlled study.', 'Androgen Deprivation Therapy and Mental Health: Impact on Depression and Cognition.', 'Cognitive impairment among prostate cancer patients: An overview of reviews.', 'Effects of androgen deprivation on white matter integrity and processing speed in prostate cancer patients.', 'The effects of androgen deprivation on working memory and quality of life in prostate cancer patients: The roles of hypothalamic connectivity.', 'Topological Abnormalities of Pallido-Thalamo-Cortical Circuit in Functional Brain Network of Patients With Nonchemotherapy With Non-small Cell Lung Cancer.']"""

The remaining fractions, however, do not respond to RLT. The aim of this explorative analysis was to identify pre-therapeutic factors for the prediction of response.  Methods:   46 patients [age = 68 years (50-87)] with mCRPC who consecutively underwent RLT with 177Lu PSMA [median applied activity = 6 GBq (2.9-6.2)] were included and analysed retrospectively. The association of different clinical and laboratory factors and parameters from pre-therapeutic 68Ga PSMA positron emission tomography (PET) with the outcome of RLT was tested (Fisher's test). Outcome was defined as PSA changes 8 weeks after second RLT [partial response (PR), PSA decrease > 50%; progressive disease (PD), PSA increase ≥ 25%; stable disease (SD), others]. Significant predictive factors were combined in a predictive score.  Results:   30% showed a post-treatment PR (median 73% PSA decrease), 35% SD (median 17% PSA decrease) and 35% PD (median 42% PSA increase). Significant predictors for PD were alkaline phosphatase (ALP) > 135 U/l (p = 0.002), PSA > 200 ng/ml (p = 0.036), and maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) of the ""hottest lesion"" in pre-therapeutic PET < 45 (p = 0.005). The predictive score including PSA, ALP and SUVmax could separate 2 distinct groups of patients: ≤ 2 predictive factors (19% PD) and 3 predictive factors (90% PD).

This study aimed to investigate other and all-cause mortality in a large cancer screening cohort.  Materials and methods:   From the PLCO (Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian) Cancer Screening Trial cohort, we selected men diagnosed with prostate cancer from 1994-2014. We examined other and all-cause survival by prostate cancer risk level, defined as the D'Amico categories for localized disease (low, intermediate and high risk) plus nonlocalized disease. We developed 3 Cox proportional hazards models to assess the relationship between risk level and survival. Model I controlled for age, race, study arm and diagnosis year. Model II additionally controlled for other demographic and medical history factors. Model III additionally controlled for initial treatment.  Results:   Of 76,672 men in PLCO and 10,859 prostate cancer cases, 9,248 (85.2%) had known prostate cancer risk level (mean±SD age 70.4±6.2 years). Median followup time from diagnosis was 10.8 years (IQR 6.8-15.0). Of 3,318 deaths 81% were from other causes. Compared to the low risk group, other-cause mortality HRs were 1.13 (95% CI 1.04-1.23), 1.35 (95% CI 1.21-1.50) and 1.63 (95% CI 1.35-1.97) for intermediate risk, high risk and advanced disease, respectively, in model II. Model III HRs were similar to model II except for advanced disease, where the HR decreased to 1.35.  Conclusions:   Other-cause survival was greater in lower vs higher risk disease, even after controlling for lifestyle characteristics and comorbidities.

Therefore, NAMPT inhibitors are promising drugs for cancer therapy by limiting energy supply of tumours. Herein, we demonstrated that the NAMPT inhibitor FK866 ((E)-N-(4-(1-Benzoylpiperidin-4-yl)butyl)-3-(pyridin-3-yl)acrylamide) dose-dependently inhibited growth and cell motility of DU-145 prostate tumour spheroids and decreased the intracellular ATP concentration. The apoptosis marker cleaved caspase-3 remained unchanged, but the autophagy marker microtubule-associated protein 1A/1B-light chain 3 (LC3) was upregulated. Growth inhibition was reversed upon co-administration of NAD to the cell culture medium. FK866 decreased calcein as well as pheophorbide A efflux from tumour spheroids and increased doxorubicin toxicity, indicating interference with function of drug efflux transporters. DU-145 multicellular tumour spheroids expressed the stem cell associated markers CD133, CD44, Oct4, Nanog, Sox2, and drug transporters ABCB1, ABCG2, and ABCC1 which are associated with stem cell properties in cancer cells. The ABCB1 inhibitor zosuquidar, the ABCG2 inhibitor Ko143, and the ABCC1 inhibitor MK571 increased calcein retention.

Materials and methods:   We performed a preoperative 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT scan in 51 patients with prostate cancer (PCa), who were scheduled for an RP operation between January 2014 and June 2016 in our clinic. The correlation between the RP pathology and the results of the 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT scan was investigated.  Results:   When the 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT scan results were evaluated according to the risk groups, intraprostatic activity was found in 5 of 12 patients (41.7%) in the low-risk group, 15 of 19 patients in the intermediate risk group (78.9%), and 90% patients in the high-risk group. The 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT scan sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values and accuracy were calculated as 58.2%, 75.3%, 84.4%, 44%, and 63%, respectively for intraprostatic tumor localization; 68.4%, 75%, 61.9%, 80%, and %72.6%, respectively for extracapsular extension; 63.6%, 92.3%, 70%, 90%, and 86%, respectively for seminal vesicle involvement; 50%, 100%, 100%, 88%, and 89.3%, respectively for LN metastasis.  Conclusion:   The 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT scan accurately demonstrates intraprostatic tumor localization in high-risk group and presence of seminal vesicle involvement, which can help to accurately detect the target lesion before prostate biopsy.

However, the pathogenesis of CRC carcinogenesis is still unexplored. In this study, we investigated the role of miR-107 in the regulation of CRC cell proliferation and apoptosis. First, the expression of miR-107 was observed to be aberrantly increased in human CRC tumor tissues and cell lines when compared to the colonic control tissues and colon epithelial cells. Further study showed that the proliferative and apoptotic capacities of human CRC SW480 and LoVo cells were aberrantly regulated by miR-107. The proliferation of SW480 and LoVo cells was remarkably enhanced by the miR-107 mimic but suppressed by the miR-107 inhibitor when compared to the negative control. On the contrary, the apoptotic rate of both SW480 and LoVo cells was significantly inhibited by miR-107 overexpression but increased by miR-107 inhibition. In addition, we identified prostate apoptosis response-4 (Par4) as a direct target of miR-107 with a potential binding site on the 3-UTR of mRNA, as evaluated by bioinformatics prediction and luciferase reporter assay. Par4 expression levels were significantly inhibited by the miR-107 mimic but upregulated by the miR-107 inhibitor in both SW480 and LoVo cells. Compared to the control, the increase in Par4 expression significantly inhibited the induction role of miR-107 in the proliferation of SW480 and LoVo cells, and the apoptotic rate of cells repressed by the miR-107 mimic was also reversed by Par4 overexpression. In summary, our results demonstrated that miR-107 exerts a positive role in the survival of CRC cells by directly targeting Par4.

Quality of smoke evacuation and scope cleaning frequency were also measured. Results: All procedures were completed at 6 mm Hg without needing to increase pressures with either insufflator. There were no statistically significant differences in partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2), partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2), HCO3, pH, carbon dioxide (CO2) elimination, or end-tidal carbon dioxide pressure (EtCO2) between groups. The AirSeal group had a lower maximum peritoneal pressure (7.9 vs 9.9 mm Hg, p < 0.001) but without differences in pain scores or analgesics. Surgeon-assessed smoke evacuation was poorer using CIS with more laparoscope cleanings in nonobese patients than with AirSeal (2.1 vs 3.0, p = 0.026). Conclusion: Valveless-trocar insufflation provided more stable pressure but without benefits in physiologic or pain parameters. Previously identified benefits may have been negated by being able to complete all procedures at ultralow pressure with either insufflator, although an expert bedside assistant moderating suction may have contributed to feasibility of maintaining low pressure with CIS. A randomized trial of 6 vs 15 mm Hg is currently underway.

Material and methods:   After median seven years since RP and six years since post-RP RAD, development of EPIC-26 Domain Summary Scores (DSS Changes) and HRQoL scores (SF-12) since the pre-RP situation were evaluated in respectively 317 prostatectomized men without and in 63 patients with additional post-RP RAD. Post-treatment inter-group differences of the prevalent Symptom Burden and of the DSS Changes were calculated. Multivariable logistic regressions evaluated the associations between DSS Changes and post-treatment impaired HRQoL.  Results:   Compared to RP alone, post-RP RAD increased the post-treatment Symptom Burden, with least inter-group differences within the urinary irritative/obstructive and bowel domain. No significant inter-group difference emerged for the proportions of men with impaired HRQoL. The odds of impaired HRQoL increased significantly with rising DSS Changes (worsening) within the vitality/hormonal domain. Worsening within urinary incontinence and bowel domains significantly increased the odds of impaired physical QoL. High HRQoL scores before RP reduced the odds of post-treatment impaired HRQoL. Living without a partner and use of androgen deprivation therapy increased this odds.  Conslusions:   Post-RP radiotherapy increases post-treatment Symptom Burden with negative, though limited impact on the patient's HRQoL. Counceling before post-RP radiotherapy should cover this possible development, taking into account the patient's social situation.""","""['Kari Vatne Monsen', 'Sophie D Fosså', 'Alv A Dahl', 'Tor Å Myklebust', 'Sigbjørn Smeland', 'Andreas Stensvold']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Scand J Urol""","""['Quality of life impact of treatments for localized prostate cancer: cohort study with a 5 year follow-up.', 'Health-related quality of life in men with prostate cancer undergoing active surveillance versus radical prostatectomy, external-beam radiotherapy, prostate brachytherapy and reference population: a cross-sectional study.', 'Long-term outcomes among localized prostate cancer survivors: health-related quality-of-life changes after radical prostatectomy, external radiation, and brachytherapy.', 'Sexual bother and function after radical prostatectomy: predictors of sexual bother recovery in men despite persistent post-operative sexual dysfunction.', 'Quality of life following radical prostatectomy.', 'The Longitudinal Course of Prospectively Recorded Patient-reported Outcomes in Prostate Cancer Patients Treated with Surgery and Salvage Radiotherapy.']"""

Materials and methods:   We performed a single center, retrospective, cohort study on patients diagnosed with clinically localized prostate cancer and submitted to radical prostatectomy between January 2010 and December 2016. We evaluated clinical and anatomopathological characteristics from the biopsy and radical prostatectomy specimen and correlated with biochemical recurrence (BCR) using a survival analysis. We also evaluated the impact of PNI in patients with criteria for active surveillance.  Results:   The cohort analyzed consists of 107 patients, with a mean age of 63.1 years and a mean PSA prior to biopsy of 7.8 ng/ml. In prostate biopsy, 66.4% of the patients had a Gleason score of 6, 30.9% had a Gleason score of 7, and 2.7% had a Gleason score of 8 or higher, with PNI being detected in 57 (53.3%) of the patients. Regarding the anatomopathological characteristics of the surgical specimen, invasion of the seminal vesicles was observed in 6.5%, lymph nodes involvement in 9.3% and positive surgical margins in 27.1% of the cases. During follow-up, BCR was recorded in 24.3% of cases. Clinicopathological features were stratified according to the presence or absence of PNI, with statistical significance in relation to the Gleason Score (p = 0.001), pathologic T stage (p = 0.001), D'Amico risk (p = 0.002) and upstaging of the Gleason score (p = 0.045).

Material and methods:   A national, web-based survey was performed. A questionnaire composed of 18 multiple choice questions was e-mailed to 941 currently active urologists, members of the Italian Society of Urology. Preserving anonymity, respondents' demographics were collected (e.g. geographic region, type of workplace, prostate procedures performed) as well as data concerning their attitudes and perceptions towards mpMRI (e.g. indications deemed appropriate, degree of confidence in mpMRI results). Data were expressed as raw numbers and percentages of survey answers.  Results:   In total, 98 responses were received (participation rate = 10.4%). Respondents mostly worked in urban areas (96%) and primarily in hospital settings (89%), while 48% of them worked in southern Italy. 97% of respondents considered mpMRI useful to detect Prostate Cancer (PCa) in patients with prior negative biopsy, 64% in biopsy-naïve patients and 60% for PCa pre-operatory staging. About half (42%) of the participants declared that mpMRI results frequently lead them to change PCa management strategy. Standardization of mpMRI acquisition and reporting was partially unsatisfactory. Reported waiting time for mpMRI scans was longer than 4 weeks for 51% of respondents.

Here, we report on recombinant analog of Hct-S3 (rHct-S3), belonging to the combinatory library of Heteractis crispa actinoporins. rHct-S3 exhibited cytotoxic activity against breast MDA-MB-231 (IC50 = 7.3 µM), colorectal HT-29 (IC50 = 6.8 µM), and melanoma SK-MEL-28 (IC50 = 8.3 µM) cancer cells. The actinoporin effectively prevented epidermal growth factor -induced neoplastic transformation of JB6 Cl41 cells by 34% ± 0.2 and decreased colony formation of HT-29 cells by 47% ± 0.9, MDA-MB-231 cells by 37% ± 1.2, and SK-MEL-28 cells by 34% ± 3.6. Moreover, rHct-S3 decreased proliferation and suppressed migration of colorectal carcinoma cells by 31% ± 5.0 and 99% ± 6.4, respectively. The potent anti-migratory activity was proposed to mediate by decreased matrix metalloproteinases-2 and -9 expression. In addition, rHct-S3 induced programmed cell death by cleavage of caspase-3 and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase, as well as regulation of Bax and Bcl-2.

The method was applied to photon-mediated treatments of three prostate cases and compared to conventional, PTV-based planning with margins selected to achieve similar CTV coverage as the robustly optimized plans. Clinical goals for the CTV and healthy tissue were used in comparison between the two types of plans. Out of the two clinical goals for overdosage of the CTV, the three robustly optimized plans violated respectively 2, 2, and 0 goals in the mean over the scenarios, whereas none of the PTV plans violated these goals. Of the ten clinical goals for rectum, bladder, anal canal, and bulbus, the robustly optimized plans violated respectively 0, 1, and 1 goals in the mean, whereas the PTV plans violated 5, 7, and 4 goals.

Gli activity is regulated by a post-translational proteolytic process that is suppressed by Hedgehog signaling. In prostate cancer cells, however, Gli activation is mediated by an interaction of active androgen receptor proteins with Gli3 that stabilizes Gli3 in its un-proteolyzed form. Here we show that the estrogen receptor (ER), ERα, also binds Gli3 and activates Gli in BrCa cells. Moreover, we show that ER + BrCa cells are dependent on Gli3 for cancer cell growth.  Methods:   Transfection with Gli-luciferase reporter was used to report Gli activity in 293FT or BrCa cells (MCF7, T47D, MDA-MB-453) with or without steroid ligands. Co-immunoprecipitation and proximity ligation were used to show association of Gli3 with ERα. Gli3 stability was determined by western blots of BrCa cell extracts. ERα knockdown or destabilization (by fulvestrant) was used to assess how loss of ERα affects estradiol-induced Gli reporter activity, formation of intranuclear ERα-Gli3 complexes and Gli3 stability. Expression of Gli1 and/or other endogenous Gli-target genes in BrCa cells were measured by qPCR in the presence or absence of estradiol. Gli3 knockdown was assessed for effects on BrCa cell growth using the Cyquant assay.  Results:   ERα co-transfection increased Gli reporter activity in 293FT cells that was further increased by estradiol. Gli3 co-precipitated in ERα immunoprecipitates. Acute (2 h) estradiol increased Gli reporter activity and the formation of intranuclear ERα-Gli3 complexes in ER + BrCa cells but more chronic estradiol (48 h) reduced ERα-Gli complexes commensurate with reduced ERα levels. Gli3 stability and endogenous activity was only increased by more chronic estradiol treatment. Fulvestrant or ERα knockdown suppressed E2-induction of Gli activity, intranuclear ERα-Gli3 complexes and stabilization of Gli3. Gli3 knockdown significantly reduced the growth of BrCa cells.  Conclusions:   ERα interacts with Gli3 in BrCa cells and estradiol treatment leads to Gli3 stabilization and increased expression of Gli-target genes. Furthermore, we found tthat Gli3 is necessary for BrCa cell growth. These results support the idea that the ERα-Gli interaction and Gli3 may be novel targets for effective control of BrCa growth.""","""['Shabnam Massah', 'Jane Foo', 'Na Li', 'Sarah Truong', 'Mannan Nouri', 'Lishi Xie', 'Gail S Prins', 'Ralph Buttyan']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Mol Cell Endocrinol""","""['Non-canonical activation of hedgehog in prostate cancer cells mediated by the interaction of transcriptionally active androgen receptor proteins with Gli3.', 'Transcriptional regulation of vascular endothelial growth factor by estradiol and tamoxifen in breast cancer cells: a complex interplay between estrogen receptors alpha and beta.', 'Protein kinase A exhibits selective modulation of estradiol-dependent transcription in breast cancer cells that is associated with decreased ligand binding, altered estrogen receptor alpha promoter interaction, and changes in receptor phosphorylation.', 'Estrogen receptor-dependent and independent mechanisms of breast cancer carcinogenesis.', 'NUDT5 as a novel drug target and prognostic biomarker for ER-positive breast cancer.', 'Gender-related differentially expressed genes in pancreatic cancer: possible culprits or accomplices?', 'Resveratrol inhibits TRAF6/PTCH/SMO signal and regulates prostate cancer progression.', 'Embryonic Programs in Cancer and Metastasis-Insights From the Mammary Gland.']"""

Although smoking cessation after genitourinary cancer diagnosis is a critical component of survivorship, factors related to continued smoking are under studied.  Materials and methods:   A cross-sectional analysis was conducted using data from the National Health Interview Survey (2014-2018). Our primary study outcome was the prevalence and correlates of cigarette smoking among adults with a history of smoking-related (kidney or bladder) urological cancer compared to a nonsmoking-related control (prostate cancer). We used regression analyses to assess the association of having a smoking-related genitourinary cancer history with continued cigarette smoking after diagnosis. Secondary outcomes were yearly smoking trends, quit attempts and reported receipt of smoking cessation counseling.  Results:   A total of 2,664 respondents reported a history of genitourinary cancer, representing weighted estimates of 990,820 (smoking-related genitourinary cancer) and 2,616,596 (prostate cancer) adults. Survivors of smoking-related genitourinary cancers had a significantly higher overall prevalence of current cigarette use (14.8% vs 8.6%, p <0.001) and also reported more frequent receipt of counseling (79.8% vs 66.2%, p=0.02) but did not attempt to quit any more often than those with prostate cancer (52.4% vs 47.2%, p=0.44). Time trends demonstrated stable and persistent cigarette use among survivors of all genitourinary cancers. After adjustment for sociodemographic confounders, cancer type was not associated with current cigarette smoking (OR 1.23, 95% CI 0.86-1.77). However, older age and more advanced educational attainment were associated with lower odds of current cigarette smoking, while single marital status was associated with higher odds.  Conclusions:   In this population-based cross-sectional study of survivors of genitourinary cancers, those with a reported smoking-related genitourinary cancer had a higher prevalence of current cigarette smoking compared to those with prostate cancer, our nonsmoking-related control.

The frequent occurrence of low PSA values (<10 ng/ml) in patients with highly suspicious prostate cancer, however, has undermined the accuracy of clinical examinations. The aim of this study was to develop a better resolution for diagnosing prostate cancer to overcome the disadvantage of PSA.  Methods:   We focused on the glycosylation status of patients' serum proteins and conducted comprehensive lectin microarray analyses to characterize N- and O-glycans using sera from prostate cancer and benign prostatic diseases. Next, we retrieved candidate serum proteins with characteristic glycan structures using lectin-immobilized beads and identified them by quantitative mass spectrometry using a technique referred to as isobaric tag for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ) labeling. Finally, we constructed a new assay to quantify a candidate glycoprotein with the newly identified glycans.  Results:   Lectin microarray analyses revealed that sera from patients with prostate cancer had a higher affinity for Jacalin, Amaranthus caudatus (ACA) lectin, and Maclura pomifera (MPA) lectin, compared with that from patients with benign prostatic diseases and normal subjects, suggesting that O-glycosylated proteins are more abundant in sera from patients with prostate cancer. Then, serum glycoproteins preferentially adsorbed onto Jacalin-Agarose as well as biotin-ACA/and biotin-MPA/streptavidin-immobilized magnetic beads were isolated, labeled with iTRAQ, and identified using quantitative mass spectrometry. It was found that the ACA- and MPA-recognizable clusterin was more enriched in patients' sera from prostate cancer compared with those from benign prostatic diseases. Following this discovery, we constructed a Luminex-based assay to quantify O-glycosylated clusterin, in which total serum clusterin was first captured on anti-clusterin antibody-immobilized beads, and then clusterin-associated O-glycans were determined by the pair of biotin-MPA and streptavidin-phycoerythrin. When PSA values registered less than 10 ng/ml, the corresponding serum level of MPA-recognized clusterin determined by this assay was beneficial for distinguishing the patients with prostate cancer from the patients with benign prostatic disease.  Conclusion:   For PSA values that measure less than 10 ng/ml, the serum O-glycosylated clusterin level can be a complementary indicator for the malignancy of prostate cancer.""","""['Saiko Kazuno', 'Tsutomu Fujimura', 'Makoto Fujime', 'Yoshiki Miura', 'Takashi Ueno']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Glycosylation status of serum immunoglobulin G in patients with prostate diseases.', 'Analysis of serum glycome by lectin microarrays for prostate cancer patients - a search for aberrant glycoforms.', 'Different glycan structures in prostate-specific antigen from prostate cancer sera in relation to seminal plasma PSA.', 'Glycosylation of prostate specific antigen and its potential diagnostic applications.', 'Altered glycosylation in prostate cancer.', 'High-Throughput Glycomic Methods.', 'Combining Magnetic Resonance Diffusion-Weighted Imaging with Prostate-Specific Antigen to Differentiate Between Malignant and Benign Prostate Lesions.']"""

However, activating mutations in the Wnt/β-catenin pathway are not common in prostate cancer, suggesting alternative regulations may exist. Here, we report that the expression of endothelial cell-specific molecule 1 (ESM1), a secretory proteoglycan, is positively associated with prostate cancer stemness and progression by promoting Wnt/β-catenin signaling. Elevated ESM1 expression correlates with poor overall survival and metastasis. Accumulation of nuclear ESM1, instead of cytosolic or secretory ESM1, supports prostate cancer stemness by interacting with the ARM domain of β-catenin to stabilize β-catenin-TCF4 complex and facilitate the transactivation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling targets. Accordingly, activated β-catenin in turn mediates the nuclear entry of ESM1. Our results establish the significance of mislocalized ESM1 in driving metastasis in prostate cancer by coordinating the Wnt/β-catenin pathway, with implications for its potential use as a diagnostic or prognostic biomarker and as a candidate therapeutic target in prostate cancer.""","""['Ke-Fan Pan', 'Wei-Jiunn Lee', 'Chun-Chi Chou', 'Yi-Chieh Yang', 'Yu-Chan Chang', 'Ming-Hsien Chien', 'Michael Hsiao', 'Kuo-Tai Hua']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""EMBO J""","""['miR-103/107 prolong Wnt/β-catenin signaling and colorectal cancer stemness by targeting Axin2.', 'ESM1/HIF‑1α pathway modulates chronic intermittent hypoxia‑induced non‑small‑cell lung cancer proliferation, stemness and epithelial‑mesenchymal transition.', 'CCL16 maintains stem cell-like properties in breast cancer by activating CCR2/GSK3β/β-catenin/OCT4 axis.', 'Exploring the Wnt Pathway as a Therapeutic Target for Prostate Cancer.', 'Tumour-stroma interactions in colorectal cancer: converging on beta-catenin activation and cancer stemness.', 'Immunological modifications following chemotherapy are associated with delayed recurrence of ovarian cancer.', 'The Molecular Biology of Prostate Cancer Stem Cells: From the Past to the Future.', 'Development of an immune-related gene prognostic risk model and identification of an immune infiltration signature in the tumor microenvironment of colon cancer.', 'Improving the Post-Operative Prediction of BCR-Free Survival Time with mRNA Variables and Machine Learning.', 'Validation of ESM1 Related to Ovarian Cancer and the Biological Function and Prognostic Significance.']"""

Although clinical trials have established the safety and efficacy of hypofractionation as a primary therapy, there are limited data in a postoperative setting. We conducted a prospective trial to evaluate the safety and feasibility of postoperative hypofractionated RT to the prostate bed.  Methods and materials:   In this phase 2 trial, patients submitted to radical prostatectomy were treated with hypofractionated RT to the prostate bed (adjuvant or salvage). The prescribed dose was 51 Gy in 15 fractions (3.4 Gy per fraction), using intensity modulated and image guided radiation therapy techniques. The primary endpoint was the rate of acute genitourinary (GU) grade ≥2 toxicity. Secondary endpoints included acute gastrointestinal (GI) and late GU/GI toxicities, biochemical failure-free survival (BFFS), metastasis-free survival, cancer-specific survival, overall survival, and health-related quality of life.  Results:   Of 64 enrolled patients, 61 received radiation therapy (57 salvage and 4 adjuvant radiation therapy). After a median follow-up of 16 months, 11.5% of patients experienced acute grade ≥2 GU symptoms and 13.1% experienced acute grade ≥2 GI symptoms. The late grade ≥2 GU toxicity rate was 8.2%, and 1 patient (1.6%) developed both acute and late grade 3 GU toxicity. The late grade ≥2 GI toxicity rate was 11.5%, and no grade 3 GI adverse events were reported. The short follow-up limits our ability to perform a robust oncologic endpoint assessment; however, the 2-year BFFS, use of subsequent salvage therapy, and the development of metastasis were 95.1%, 0%, and 0%, respectively.  Conclusions:   Hypofractionated RT to the prostate bed in 15 treatments was safe, with an acceptable GU and GI toxicity profile.

Previous studies have demonstrated that HAE can inhibit human prostate cancer metastasis and murine breast cancer proliferation. However, the effect of HAE on human breast cancer cells has not been clarified.  Aim of the study:   To investigate the effects and underlying mechanism of HAE on self-renewal of stem-like cells and spontaneous and transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1-enhanced wound healing, invasion and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in breast cancer cells.  Methods:   HAE was prepared from sika deer by sequential enzymatic digestions and the active compounds were determined by HPLC. The effects of HAE on the viability, mammosphere formation, wound healing and invasion of MDA-MB-231 and SK-BR3 cells were determined. The impact of HAE treatment on spontaneous and TGF-β1-promoted EMT and the nuclear factor (NF)-κB signaling in breast cancer cells was examined by quantitative RT-PCR and western blotting.  Results:   Treatment with HAE at varying concentrations did not change the viability of breast cancer cells. However, HAE at 0.25 or 0.5 mg/mL significantly reduced the number and size of formed mammospheres, and inhibited spontaneous and TGF-β1-enhanced wound healing, invasion and EMT in MDA-MB-231 and SK-BR3 cells in a dose-dependent manner. TGF-β1 treatment significantly decreased IκBα expression and increased NF-kBp65 phosphorylation in breast cancer cells, indicating that TGF-β1 enhanced NF-κB signaling. In contrast, HAE treatment attenuated the spontaneous and TGF-β1-enhanced NF-κB signaling in breast cancer cells.

The resulting Lee-Rosen model, TCPLR, was used to compute TCPs for treatment courses with and without weekend treatment for tumors with different proliferation rates - slow (prostate), moderate (breast), and rapid (head and neck). TCPs were computed using ideal uniform dose distributions and actual patient plans. The doses for the uniform plans were the mean doses for the prostate and breast cases and the minimum tumor dose for the head and neck case. The TCPLR model predictions agreed with expectations that TCP increases with increasing Tk in all cases. For standard fractionation, as Tk increased from 0 to 4 weeks, TCP increased for the patient distributions by 74.7% for the head and neck cancer, by 6.2% for the breast cancer, and by 2.4% for the prostate cancers. For the uniform dose distributions, the increases were 79.2%, 5.7%, and 2.3%, respectively. TCP increased as the number of weekend breaks decreased. The effect of weekend breaks decreased as the tumor proliferation rate decreased. For the head and neck tumor, notable decreases in TCP of 6.0% (uniform dose distribution) and 6.8% (actual plan dose distribution) were observed with Friday starts compared to Monday starts for the standard 5 fx/wk schedule (Tk = 4 wk). The 7 fx/wk schedule produced increases in TCP of 17.0% and 20.5% for the uniform and patient dose distributions, respectively, compared to the standard schedule. For the breast cancer, starting the 5 fx/wk schedule on Friday decreased the TCP by 0.2% (Tk = 4 wk) compared to a Monday start. The 7 fx/wk schedule produced increases of 0.3% and 0.4% in TCP compared to the standard schedule for the uniform and patient dose distributions, respectively (Tk = 4 wk). For the prostate cancer, the change in TCP for 5 fx/wk schedules starting on different days was 0.1%. The 7 fx/wk schedule increased TCP by 0.8% compared to the standard schedule (Tk = 4 wk). TCP values for the uniform dose distributions for the standard schedule (Tk = 4 wk) agreed with the TCP values for the actual dose distributions within 4.5% for the head and neck tumor and within 0.2% for the breast and prostate tumors. This good agreement suggests that the doses chosen for the uniform dose distributions were good approximations to the clinical doses. The results for head and neck tumors support, in part, the current practice of hyperfractionated/accelerated radiotherapy. They also suggest that shortening the overall treatment time for conventional fractions by eliminating weekend breaks might be beneficial. The predicted effect on TCP of the various schedules studied was insignificant for prostate and breast tumors, suggesting that a weekend treatment might not be necessary for patients starting radiotherapy on a Friday. There is significant uncertainty in the values of the model parameters chosen for these calculations, and no consideration was given to the potential effects of these various schedules on normal tissues.""","""['Tae Kyu Lee', 'Isaac I Rosen']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""J Theor Biol""","""['Impact of schedule duration on head and neck radiotherapy: accelerated tumor repopulation versus compensatory mucosal proliferation.', 'Dose-volume conundrum for response of prostate cancer to brachytherapy: summary dosimetric measures and their relationship to tumor control probability.', 'Fitting tumor control probability models to biopsy outcome after three-dimensional conformal radiation therapy of prostate cancer: pitfalls in deducing radiobiologic parameters for tumors from clinical data.', 'Is there an optimum overall time for head and neck radiotherapy?

Pitifully, as it stands there is a serious lack of knowledge of the extent to which the expression and function of m6A RNA methylation can influence prostate cancer (PC). Herein, we systematically analyzed the expression levels of 35 m6A RNA methylation regulators mentioned in literatures among prostate adenocarcinoma patients in the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), finding that most of them expressed differently between cancer tissues and normal tissues with the significance of p < 0.05. Utilizing consensus clustering, we divided PC patients into two subgroups based on the differentially expressed m6A RNA methylation regulators with significantly different clinical outcomes. To appraise the discrepancy in total transcriptome between subgroups, the functional enrichment analysis was conducted for differential signaling pathways and cellular processes. Next, we selected five critical genes by the criteria that the regulators had a significant impact on prognosis of PC patients from TCGA through the last absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) Cox regression and obtained a risk score by weighted summation for prognosis prediction. The survival analysis curve and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve showed that this signature could excellently predict the prognosis of PC patients. The univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses proved the independent prognostic value of the signature.

M. oleifera has been shown to inhibit tumor cell growth, but this effect has not been demonstrated on prostate cancer cells. In this study, we evaluated the inhibitory effect of M. oleifera alkaloids (MOA) on proliferation and migration of PC3 human prostate cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, we elucidated the mechanism of these effects. The results showed that MOA inhibited proliferation of PC3 cells and induced apoptosis and cell cycle arrest. Furthermore, MOA suppressed PC3 cell migration and inhibited the expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP)-9. In addition, MOA significantly downregulated the expression of cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2), β-catenin, phosphorylated glycogen synthase 3β, and vascular endothelial growth factor, and suppressed production of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). Furthermore, FH535 (β-catenin inhibitor) and MOA reversed PGE2-induced PC3 cell proliferation and migration, and the effects of MOA and FH535 were not additive.

Better soft tissue visualisation has led to some unusual findings.  Case and outcomes:   A patient with T1c N0 M0 prostate adenocarcinoma received 60Gy in 20# radiotherapy on the MRL. Radiotherapy planning (RTP) scans were completed on both CT and MR (using T2 and T1 weighted three-dimensional turbo spin echo sequences, reconstructed transaxially (TRA). The MR scans revealed atypical oedema in the right peripheral zone, visualised on T2-weighted (T2w) MR Images as an accumulation of high signal intensity fluid. Daily MRL treatment includes a (T2w 3D Tra) sequence with which oedematous changes could be monitored. The images demonstrated an increase in oedematous volume over fractions 1-10 causing the prostate contour variations from the initial planning scans. Despite the prostate volume variations PTV coverage was never breached and dose constraints were always met for both PTV and surrounding organs at risk (OAR's), excluding the need for oncologist input. A single Therapeutic Radiographer (RTT) experienced in MRL delivery, contoured the prostate and oedematous volumes on the radiotherapy plan (RTP) MR and all on-treatment MR images to assess change over the radiotherapy course. The initial volumes were 53.4 cm3 and 8.3 cm3 for the prostate plus oedema and oedema alone respectively. The most significant change was seen for both the prostate and oedema on fraction nine (68.0 cm3 and 10.1 cm3, respectively). Reductions were noted after this with final (fraction 20) volumes of 55.2 cm3 and 0.58 cm3 respectively.  Discussion:   The ability to visualise prostatic oedema was new to the radiotherapy treatment team due to better soft tissue visualisation than standard radiotherapy. The results from contouring the prostate and oedema volumes confirmed radiographer observations and demonstrated how oedema impacted the overall prostate volume by quantifying the oedematous variations over time. The changes in oedema volume are presumed to be in response to radiotherapy.  Conclusion:   Further adaptive radiotherapy work-flow developments, utilising an ""Adapt to Shape"" model will allow real-time re-contouring of the prostate to ensure tumour control is not compromised. Further work investigating the frequency and impact of oedemotous changes to external beam prostate patients will help to inform practice.""","""['Abigael Clough', 'Pete Bridge', 'Rosie Hales', 'Lisa McDaid', 'Ananya Choudhury', 'Cynthia L Eccles']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""J Med Imaging Radiat Sci""","""['Therapeutic Radiographers at the Helm: Moving Towards Radiographer-Led MR-Guided Radiotherapy.', 'Retrospective study comparing MR-guided radiation therapy (MRgRT) setup strategies for prostate treatment: repositioning vs. replanning.', 'Automatic Substitute Computed Tomography Generation and Contouring for Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)-Alone External Beam Radiation Therapy From Standard MRI Sequences.', 'Primary treatment of prostate cancer using 1.5\xa0T MR-linear accelerator.', 'MRI-GUIDED RADIOTHERAPY FOR PROSTATE CANCER: A NEW PARADIGM.', 'Case Report: MR-Guided Adaptive Radiotherapy, Some Room to Maneuver.']"""

Overutilization of screening procedures inconsistent with the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force guidelines contributes to the high cost of health care. The authors hypothesize that higher health literacy supports guideline-concordant screening. This study assesses the effect of health literacy on nonrecommended prostate, breast, and cervical cancer screening in patients older than the recommended screening age limit.  Methods:   The 2016 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System included health literacy modules. Respondents self-reported their ability to obtain and understand health information, resulting in 4 health literacy rankings. The authors calculated the population-weighted proportion of respondents in each health literacy category who underwent screening past the Task Force‒recommended age limit. The ORs of nonrecommended screening for each malignancy were calculated, with low health literacy as the ref category.  Results:   Individuals with higher health literacy underwent more nonrecommended screening. Nonrecommended prostate cancer screening was performed in 27.4% (95% CI=23.7%, 31.4%) and 47.7% (95% CI=44.1%, 51.3%) of respondents with low and high health literacy, respectively (p<0.001). Nonrecommended breast cancer screening was performed in 46.8% (95% CI=42.6%, 51.1%) and 67.7% (95% CI=64.2%, 71.1%) of respondents with low and high health literacy, respectively (p=0.002). Nonrecommended cervical cancer screening was performed in 33.8% (95% CI=31.1%, 36.5%) and 48.4% (95% CI=46.3%, 50.5%) of respondents with low and high health literacy, respectively (p<0.001). Individuals with high health literacy were significantly more likely than those with low health literacy to screen against the recommendations for prostate (OR=1.73, 95% CI=1.34, 2.23, p<0.001), cervical (OR=1.533, 95% CI=1.31, 1.80, p<0.001), and breast (OR=8.213, 95% CI=4.90, 13.76, p<0.001) cancer.  Conclusions:   Higher health literacy correlates with increased rates of screening beyond the recommended age, contrary to the study hypothesis.

This study aimed to investigate the diagnostic performance of positron emission tomography/magnetic resonance imaging (PET/MRI) in vivo models for predicting low-vs-high lesion risk (LH) as well as biochemical recurrence (BCR) and overall patient risk (OPR) with machine learning.  Methods:   Fifty-two patients who underwent multi-parametric dual-tracer [18F]FMC and [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 PET/MRI as well as radical prostatectomy between 2014 and 2015 were included as part of a single-center pilot to a randomized prospective trial (NCT02659527). Radiomics in combination with ensemble machine learning was applied including the [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 PET, the apparent diffusion coefficient, and the transverse relaxation time-weighted MRI scans of each patient to establish a low-vs-high risk lesion prediction model (MLH). Furthermore, MBCR and MOPR predictive model schemes were built by combining MLH, PSA, and clinical stage values of patients. Performance evaluation of the established models was performed with 1000-fold Monte Carlo (MC) cross-validation. Results were additionally compared to conventional [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 standardized uptake value (SUV) analyses.  Results:   The area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC) of the MLH model (0.86) was higher than the AUC of the [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 SUVmax analysis (0.80). MC cross-validation revealed 89% and 91% accuracies with 0.90 and 0.94 AUCs for the MBCR and MOPR models respectively, while standard routine analysis based on PSA, biopsy Gleason score, and TNM staging resulted in 69% and 70% accuracies to predict BCR and OPR respectively.

However, the effect of HS on the prostate positional displacement is poorly understood, despite its stability with HS in place. In this study, we investigated the effect of HS insertion on the interfraction prostate motion during the course of proton therapy (PT) for Japanese prostate cancer patients. The study population consisted of 22 cases of intermediate-risk prostate cancer with 11 cases with HS insertion and 11 cases without HS insertion. The irradiation position and preparation were similar for both groups. To test for reproducibility, regular confirmation computed tomography (RCCT) was done four times during the treatment period, and five times overall [including treatment planning CT (TPCT)] in each patient. Considering the prostate position of the TPCT as the reference, the change in the center of gravity of the prostate relative to the bony anatomy in the RCCTs of each patient was determined in the left-right (LR), superior-inferior (SI) and anterior-posterior (AP) directions. As a result, no significant difference was observed across the groups in the LR and SI directions. Conversely, a significant difference was observed in the AP direction (P < 0.05). The proportion of the 3D vector length ≤5 mm was 95% in the inserted group, but 55% in the non-inserted group.

SA and DA plans were created for 27 patients with localized prostate cancer. ID was introduced to the clinical target volume (CTV), rectum and bladder to obtain blurred dose distributions using an in-house software. ID was based on the motion probability function of each structure voxel and the intrafractional motion of the respective organs. From the resultant blurred dose distributions of SA and DA plans, various parameters, including the tumor control probability, normal tissue complication probability, homogeneity index, conformity index, modulation complexity score for VMAT, dose-volume indices and monitor units (MUs), were evaluated to compare the two techniques. Statistical analysis showed that most CTV and rectum parameters were significantly larger for SA plans than for DA plans (P < 0.05). Furthermore, SA plans had fewer MUs and were less complex (P < 0.05). The significant differences observed had no clinical significance, indicating that both plans are comparable in terms of target and OAR dosimetry when ID is considered.

Patients and methods:   We retrospectively analysed prospectively maintained database including consecutive men undergoing IB from March 2013 to October 2017 in 2 European centres expert in this procedure. We selected men with the following criteria: No previous treatment for prostate cancer (CaP), multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) lesion(s) PIRADS score ≥ 3, FTB showing no clinically significant cancer (csCaP), and subsequent IB. Patient's characteristics, mpMRI findings, biopsy technique, and histopathological results were extracted. The primary outcome was to determine the detection rate of csCaP, defined as any Gleason pattern ≥ 4. A multivariable analysis was performed to identify predictors of positive findings at IB.  Results:   Fifty-three men were included. Median age was 68 years (interquartile range [IQR] 64-68), median Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA) was 7.6 ng/ml (IQR 5.2-10.9), and median prostate volume was 59 ml (IQR 44-84). Fifty-six lesions with PIRADS score 3 in 9 cases (16%), 4 in 30 cases (54%), and 5 in 17 cases (30%) were detected. FTB was performed in all cases using a transrectal approach with 3 different platforms (Toshiba, Koelis, and Artemis). Median time between FTB and IB was 3 months (IQR 1-7). A median of 2 cores per lesion were collected with IB (IQR 2-3). No cancer, clinically insignificant and clinically significant cancer were found in 33 (59%), 9 (16%), and 14 (25%) targeted lesions, respectively. Median maximum cancer core length and maximum positive percentage were 9 mm (3-13) and 55% (21%-80%). The only predictor of csCaP on IB was prostate volume (P = 0.026) with an ideal cut-off at 70 ml.  Conclusion:   One in 4 patients with previous negative FTB, IB was able to detect csCaP.

Objective:   To determine the cost-effectiveness of PSMA-PET/CT when compared with conventional imaging.  Design, setting, and participants:   A cost-effectiveness analysis was developed using data from the proPSMA study. proPSMA included patients with high-risk prostate cancer assigned to conventional imaging or 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT with planned health economics data collected. The cost-effectiveness analysis was conducted from an Australian societal perspective.  Intervention: 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT compared with conventional imaging (CT and bone scan).  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   The primary outcome from proPSMA was diagnostic accuracy (nodal and distant metastases). This informed a decision tree analysis of the cost per accurate diagnosis.  Results and limitations:   The estimated cost per scan for PSMA PET/CT was AUD$1203, which was less than the conventional imaging cost at AUD$1412. PSMA PET/CT was thus dominant, having both better accuracy and a lower cost. This resulted in a cost of AUD$959 saved per additional accurate detection of nodal disease, and AUD$1412 saved for additional accurate detection of distant metastases. The results were most sensitive to variations in the number of men scanned for each 68Ga-PSMA-11 production run. Subsequent research is required to assess the long-term costs and benefits of PSMA PET/CT-directed care.  Conclusions:   PSMA PET/CT has lower direct comparative costs and greater accuracy compared to conventional imaging for initial staging of men with high-risk prostate cancer. This provides a compelling case for adopting PSMA PET/CT into clinical practice.  Patient summary:   The proPSMA study demonstrated that prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) better detects disease that has spread beyond the prostate compared with conventional imaging. Our analysis shows that PSMA PET/CT is also less costly than conventional imaging for the detection of disease spread.

This trend seems to be connected with some demographic changes such as aging societies, better access to diagnostic methods with high sensitivity as well as large-scale secondary prevention (prostate cancer screening at early stage before clinical manifestation). Secondary prevention is becoming more accessible and widely applied. The expected effect of prevention is to improve overall survival while the mortality trend is decreasing. The prevention success requires highly effective healthcare system that must manage additional burden which is a consequence of the need to provide optimal treatment and healthcare in a big group of cancer patients diagnosed in effective prevention programms. According to the National Cancer Registry (NCR) the number of incidence from year 1980 - 1731 cases rose in year 2013 to 12 162 cases. Apart from incidence and mortality rates, the 5-year survival is a significant factor for the assessment of a population healthcare and healthcare system efficiency. The prognosis related to prostate incidence is 22 344 men in year 2025 in comparison to 12 162 in year 2013 - that would be a double rise in incidence. CONCORD-2 results (years 1995-2009) showed, among the others, that cancer curability for some cancers, including prostate cancer improved. In year 2018 the results of CONCORD-3 were published (years 2000-2014) showing a rising trend in improvement in prostate cancer curability in Poland.  Objective:   The objective was to analyse the 5-year survival in prostate cancer patients in Poland, and in each of 16 voivodships, with the focus on changes in years 2000 - 2014 in comparison to European trends.  Material and methods:   The analysis was based on the 5-year net survival (estimated in CONCORD-3) in prostate cancer patients diagnosed in Poland (NCR national data) and in all Polish voivodships. The 5-year survival of prostate cancer patients and its changes in years 2000 - 2014 compared between 16 voivodships, Poland in total and 28 European countries.  Results:   In Poland in years 2010 - 2014 the 5-year survival in prostate cancer patients was 78.1%, and compared to years 2000 - 2004 rose by 9.3 percentage points. Despite a systematic improvement in survival the differences between individual voivodships in Poland remained. In 6 voivodships the survival was higher than average for Poland and ranged from 80 to 82%. The lowest survival was in Opolskie voivodship - 72.3%. On a European scale, the curability of prostate cancer at that time was over 90% (9 countries), while Poland was among 5 countries whose total survival rate was less than 80% (from 72.3% - Opolskie voivodship to 83.6% -- Pomeranian voivodship).  Conclusions:   The 5-year survival in prostate cancer patients in years 2010 - 2014 in Poland was significantly lower in comparison to Western Europe countries, and favourable trends on a regional level in Poland were too slow to overcome high differentiation in Europe. It is expected that changing the structure and organisation of cancer care in Poland into a modern National Oncology Network Comprehensive Cancer Care Network, together with the use of the experiences from European projects, including iPAAC and better financing will contribute to improvement in prostate cancer treatment in Poland.""","""['Aleksandra Gliniewicz', 'Dorota Dudek-Godeau', 'Magdalena Bielska-Lasota']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Rocz Panstw Zakl Hig""","""['Survival in women diagnosed with breast and cervical cancer in Poland – compared to European countries, based on CONCORD - 3 Programme.', 'Prostate cancer incidence and mortality trends among elderly and adult Europeans.', 'Italian cancer figures--Report 2015: The burden of rare cancers in Italy.', 'Tuberculosis.', 'Patterns and trends in prostate cancer incidence, survival, prevalence and mortality.

Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) have been reported to produce potent cytotoxic effects; however, the precise mechanism is unclear. In this study, AuNPs were synthesized; the average size of the particles was 62.2 ± 6 nm with smooth surface and multiple shapes, which were determined using transmission electron microscopy and field emission scanning electron microscopy. The selected area electron diffraction patterns suggested that the synthesized AuNPs were crystalline. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectrum of the synthesized AuNPs has presented an intense peak at 100 eV, signifying the entire composition of Au in the developed AuNPs. This synthesized AuNPs showed the most potent efficacy in prostate cancer cells, regardless of whether or not they were androgen dependent. Secretome determinations using two-dimensional difference in-gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE), followed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction validations, have identified a series of secretory proteins that were dysregulated by AuNP treatment in prostate cancer cells, many of which are highly involved in cytokine-chemokine functions, including CXCL3, interleukin-10, CCL2, and matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9). Further research on molecular mechanism has indicated that AuNPs can trigger the secretion of anticancer factors and myeloid cell-polarizing factors from tumor cells through MMP9 inhibition.

To determine whether the association between obesity and shorter CAS telomeres is replicable, we conducted a pooled analysis of 790 men who were surgically treated for prostate cancer, whose tissue samples were arrayed on five tissue microarray (TMA) sets. Telomere signal was measured using a quantitative telomere-specific FISH assay and normalized to 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole for 351 CAS cells (mean) per man; men were assigned their median value. Weight and height at surgery, collected via questionnaire or medical record, were used to calculate body mass index (BMI; kg/m2) and categorize men as normal (<25), overweight (25 ≤ BMI < 30), or obese (≥30). Analyses were stratified by grade and stage. Men were divided into tertiles of TMA- (overall) or TMA- and disease aggressiveness- (stratified) specific distributions; short CAS telomere status was defined by the bottom two tertiles. We used generalized linear mixed models to estimate the association between obesity and short CAS telomeres, adjusting for age, race, TMA set, pathologic stage, and grade. Obesity was not associated with short CAS telomeres overall, or among men with nonaggressive disease. Among men with aggressive disease (Gleason≥4+3 and stage>T2), obese men had a 3-fold increased odds of short CAS telomeres (OR: 3.06; 95% confidence interval: 1.07-8.75; P trend = 0.045) when compared with normal weight men. Telomere shortening in prostate stromal cells may be one mechanism through which lifestyle influences lethal prostate carcinogenesis.

A recently identified SWI/SNF subcomplex termed GLTSCR1/1L-BAF (GBAF; or ""noncanonical BAF"", ncBAF) uniquely contains bromodomain-containing protein BRD9 and glioma tumor suppressor candidate region 1 (GLTSCR1) or its paralog GLTSCR1-like (GLTSCR1L). Recent studies have identified a unique dependency on GBAF (ncBAF) complexes in synovial sarcoma and malignant rhabdoid tumors, both of which possess aberrations in canonical BAF (cBAF) and Polybromo-BAF (PBAF) complexes. Dependencies on GBAF in malignancies without SWI/SNF aberrations, however, are less defined. Here, we show that GBAF, particularly its BRD9 subunit, is required for the viability of prostate cancer cell lines in vitro and for optimal xenograft tumor growth in vivo. BRD9 interacts with androgen receptor (AR) and CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF), and modulates AR-dependent gene expression. The GBAF complex exhibits overlapping genome localization and transcriptional targets as bromodomain and extraterminal domain-containing (BET) proteins, which are established AR coregulators. Our results demonstrate that GBAF is critical for coordinating SWI/SNF-BET cooperation and uncover a new druggable target for AR-positive prostate cancers, including those resistant to androgen deprivation or antiandrogen therapies.

Methods:   We retrospectively analyzed the clinical data on 230 cases of double-plane transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy in our Department of Urology, including the patients' age, body mass index (BMI), serum total prostate-specific antigen (tPSA), PSA density (PSAD), prostate volume, and ICI in the prostate tissue.

Results:   The positive rate of prostate biopsy was 38.7% (89/230) in the total number of cases, 28.57% (n = 56) in the 196 cases with tPSA < 100 μg/L, and 97.06% (n = 33) in the 34 cases with tPSA ≥ 100 μg/L. Binary logistic regression analysis showed that the positive rate of prostate biopsy in those with tPSA < 100 μg/L was correlated positively with age (P < 0.01, OR = 1.09), tPSA (P < 0.01, OR = 1.04) and PSAD (P < 0.01, OR = 10.04), negatively with the prostate volume (P < 0.01, OR = 0.98) and ICI (P < 0.01, OR = 0.22), but not with BMI (P > 0.05).

FUS (fused in liposarcoma), a multifunctional protein essential for different cellular processes, has been demonstrated as a key link between androgen receptor signaling and cell-cycle progression in prostate cancer but has not been examined in urothelial carcinoma (UC) despite an intimate association between prostate and bladder carcinogenesis.  Aim:   To examine the immunohistochemical expression of AR and FUS in urothelial carcinoma in relation to prognostic parameters and to extrapolate any possible link between the expression of both markers and tumor progression.  Study design:   Retrospective study using immunohistochemical staining for AR and FUS on (88) cases of urothelial carcinoma.  Results:   AR shows statistically significant relations with late tumor stage, high tumor grade, and non-papillary tumor pattern. On the other hand, FUS expression correlates with early tumor stage, low tumor grade and papillary pattern. An inverse relation is found between AR and FUS expression (p=0.001). Cases with high AR IHC expression show statistically significant shorter OS, RFS and PFS compared to cases with low AR expression.

Our recent study established the orphan nuclear receptor RORγ as a novel therapeutic target for CRPC. Here, we reveal that elaiophylin (Elai), an antibiotic from Actinomycete streptomyces, is a novel RORγ antagonist and showed potent antitumor activity against CRPC in vitro and in vivo. We demonstrated that Elai selectively binded to RORγ protein and potently blocked RORγ transcriptional regulation activities. Structure-activity relationship studies showed that Elai occupied the binding pocket with several key interactions. Furthermore, Elai markedly reduced the recruitment of RORγ to its genomic DNA response element (RORE), suppressed the expression of RORγ target genes AR and AR variants, and significantly inhibited PCa cell growth. Importantly, Elai strongly suppressed tumor growth in both cell line based and patient-derived PCa xenograft models.

Recently, protein-protein interfaces that can be disrupted to identify small molecules that could be viable targets for certain diseases, such as cancer and the human immunodeficiency virus, have been identified. Existing studies computationally identify hotspots on these interfaces, with most models attaining accuracies of ~70%. Many studies do not effectively integrate information relating to amino acid chains and other structural information relating to the complex. Herein, (1) a machine learning model has been created and (2) its ability to integrate multiple features, such as those associated with amino-acid chains, has been evaluated to enhance the ability to predict protein-protein interface hotspots. Virtual drug screening analysis of a set of hotspots determined on the EphB2-ephrinB2 complex has also been performed. The predictive capabilities of this model offer an AUROC of 0.842, sensitivity/recall of 0.833, and specificity of 0.850. Virtual screening of a set of hotspots identified by the machine learning model developed in this study has identified potential medications to treat diseases caused by the overexpression of the EphB2-ephrinB2 complex, including prostate, gastric, colorectal and melanoma cancers which are linked to EphB2 mutations. The efficacy of this model has been demonstrated through its successful ability to predict drug-disease associations previously identified in literature, including cimetidine, idarubicin, pralatrexate for these conditions. In addition, nadolol, a beta blocker, has also been identified in this study to bind to the EphB2-ephrinB2 complex, and the possibility of this drug treating multiple cancers is still relatively unexplored.""","""['Rohit Nandakumar', 'Valentin Dinu']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""PeerJ""","""['Structural and biophysical characterization of the EphB4*ephrinB2 protein-protein interaction and receptor specificity.', 'Machine learning prediction of oncology drug targets based on protein and network properties.', 'Three-dimensional structure of the EphB2 receptor in complex with an antagonistic peptide reveals a novel mode of inhibition.', 'Application of Machine Learning Techniques to Predict Binding Affinity for Drug Targets: A Study of Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 2.', 'In silico structure-based approaches to discover protein-protein interaction-targeting drugs.']"""

However, descriptive data from a large cohort with extended follow up on the risk of death from CaP in men diagnosed over 70 years of age and its relationship to Gleason score (GS) and serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) level is lacking. Using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database, we evaluated the influence of GS and serum PSA levels on the risks of mortality from PC (PCM) and mortality from other causes in localized (LPC) and metastatic (MPC) disease in elderly population.  Methods:   Men diagnosed with PC over 70 years of age between 2004 and 2016 were divided into LPC and MPC groups, categorized by age: 70-74, 75-79, 80-84, 85-89, and ≥90 years and stratified by GS <7, 7, and >7, and serum PSA level <4, 4-10, 10-20, 20-50, and >50 ng/mL.

Overall, at a median follow up of 4 years, 15% of the men had died including a third from PC. While <15% of men with GS ≤7 died from PC, the PCM was >30% in men with GS >7 in LPC group, which accounted for almost half of total deaths for age 70-84 years. The GS >7 was also significantly associated with PCM in men with MPC. Furthermore, PCM directly correlated with serum PSA levels, with mortality rates reaching up to 50% and 70% for PSA >50 ng/dl for LPC and MPC, respectively.  Conclusions:   There is a substantial risk of dying in men diagnosed with LPC over 70 years of age with GS >7 or a serum PSA >20 ng/mL. Furthermore, the risk for death for MPC directly correlated with GS with PCM increasing from 10%-30% for GS ≤7 to >50% for GS >7.

Methods:   Observational cohort study including consecutive patients treated with 225Ac-PSMA TAT between February 2016 and July 2018. Primary endpoint was overall survival (OS). Furthermore, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) changes, radiological response, safety, QoL, and xerostomia were evaluated. Biopsies were analyzed with immunohistochemistry and next-generation sequencing.  Results:   Thirteen patients were included. Median OS was 8.5 months for the total cohort and 12.6 months for PSMA radioligand therapy-naïve patients. PSA declines of ≥90% and ≥50% were observed in 46% and 69% of patients, respectively. Six patients were radiologically evaluable; 50% showed partial response. All patients showed >90% total tumor volume reduction on PET imaging. Patients experienced clinically relevant decrease of pain and QoL improvement in physical and role functioning domains. Xerostomia persisted during follow-up. Patients with high baseline immunohistochemical PSMA expression or DNA damage repair alterations tended to have longer OS.  Conclusions:   TAT with 225Ac-PSMA resulted in remarkable survival and biochemical responses in advanced mCRPC patients.

Conventional CT examination has poor soft tissue resolution, which makes it difficult to accurately delineate the target area of radiotherapy. This study aimed to explore the guiding role of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in delineating the target area of presacral recurrence after radical resection of rectal cancer. Methods: A descriptive case series research method was adopted. From May 2014 to May 2019, the clinical data of 30 patients with presacral recurrence after radical resection of rectal cancer were collected, who were admitted to Peking University People's Hospital, confirmed by pathology or discussed by multidisciplinary team (MDT), with complete MRI, CT and case information. According to the gross tumor volume (GTV) with presacral recurrence outlined in CT and MRI images, including presacral recurrent lesions (GTVT) and metastatic lymph nodes (GTVN), the GTV volume was calculated, and the tumor boundary and diameter were measured. The differences between MRI and CT were compared. Results: The volume of GTVT-CT was larger than that of GTVT-MR in all the 30 patients. The median volume of GTVT-CT was 67.86 (range 5.12-234.10) cm(3), which was significantly larger than 43.02 (range 3.42-142.50) cm(3) of GTVT-MR with statistically significant difference (Z=-4.288, P<0.001). The mean volume of GTVN outlined by CT and MRI was (0.43±0.11) cm(3) and (0.40±0.10) cm(3) respectively without statistically significant difference (t=1.550, P=0.132). The mean values of boundary and radial line of the presacral lesions on CT images were all longer than those on MRI images. The vertical diameter of GTVT on CT and MRI images was (6.66±2.92) cm and (5.17±2.40) cm (t=5.466, P<0.001); the anterior boundary was (3.24±2.51) cm and (2.69±2.48) cm (t=4.685, P<0.001); the anteroposterior diameter was (4.92±2.02) cm and (4.04±1.57) cm (t=6.210, P<0.001); the left boundary was (3.05±1.00) cm and (2.64±0.78) cm (t=2.561, P=0.016); the right boundary was 2.66 (0.00-4.23) cm and 1.82 (-1.10-3.59) cm (Z=-3.950, P<0.001); the transverse diameter was (5.01±1.78) cm and (3.82±1.29) cm (t=4.648, P<0.001), respectively, whose differences were all statistically significant. MRI was superior to CT in judging the involvement of anterior organs, such as intestine, prostate, bladder and the posterior sacrum. Fifteen patients received radiotherapy according to the target area guided by MRI and 10 patients obtained clinical symptom relief.

Aurora-A kinase inhibitors have shown encouraging results in clinical trials but have not gained Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval. An innovative computational workflow named Docking-based Comparative Intermolecular Contacts Analysis (dbCICA) was applied-aiming to identify novel Aurora-A kinase inhibitors-using seventy-nine reported Aurora-A kinase inhibitors to specify the best possible docking settings needed to fit into the active-site binding pocket of Aurora-A kinase crystal structure, in a process that only potent ligands contact critical binding-site spots, distinct from those occupied by less-active ligands.

This trial evaluated whether BAT is a safe and effective first-line hormonal therapy for patients with CRPC.  Patients and methods:   In cohort C of this single-centre, open-label, phase II, multi-cohort trial (RE-sensitizing with Supraphysiologic Testosterone to Overcome REsistance study), 29 patients with CRPC received first-line hormonal therapy with 400 mg of testosterone cypionate intramuscularly every 28 days concurrent with a luteinising hormone-releasing hormone agonist/antagonist. The primary end-point of the study was the PSA50 response rate to BAT treatment.  Results:   After treatment with BAT, four of 29 patients (14%; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 4-32%) experienced a PSA50 response. The median radiographic progression-free survival to BAT was 8.5 months (95% CI: 6.9-15.1) for patients with metastatic CRPC. After progression on BAT, 17 of 18 patients (94%; 95% CI: 73-100%) achieved a PSA50 response and 15 of 18 patients (83%; 95% CI: 59-96) achieved a PSA90 response on abiraterone or enzalutamide. Twelve of 15 patients (80%; 95% CI: 52-96) with metastatic CRPC remain on abiraterone or enzalutamide with a median duration of follow-up of 11.2 months.

Objective:   This study aimed to determine the feasibility and acceptability of a remotely delivered web-based behavioral intervention among men with prostate cancer.  Methods:   We conducted a multi-site 4-arm pilot randomized controlled trial of a 3-month intervention (TrueNTH Community of Wellness). Eligibility included self-reported prostate cancer diagnosis, having a personal device that connected to the internet, age ≥18 years, and ability to read English and receive text messages and emails. Men receiving chemotherapy or radiation, or those who reported contraindications to exercise, could participate with physician clearance. Participants were randomized (1:1:1:1) to additive intervention levels: website; website and personalized diet and exercise prescription; website, personalized prescription, Fitbit, and text messages; and website, personalized prescription, Fitbit, text messages, and 2 30-minute phone calls-one with an exercise trainer and one with a registered dietician. Primary outcomes were feasibility (accrual and attrition) and acceptability (survey data and website use). We described self-reported diet and exercise behavior at the time of enrollment, 3 months, and 6 months as secondary outcomes.  Results:   In total, 202 men consented and were randomized between August 2017 and September 2018 (level 1: 49, level 2: 51, level 3: 50, level 4: 52). A total of 160 men completed the onboarding process and were exposed to their randomly assigned intervention (38, 38, 42, and 42 in levels 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively). The follow-up rate was 82.7% (167/202) at 3 months and 77.2% (156/202) at 6 months. Participants had a median age of 70 years and were primarily White and college educated. Website visit frequency over the 3-month intervention period increased across levels (median: 2, 9, 11, and 16 visits for levels 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively). Most were satisfied or very satisfied with the intervention (20/39, 51%; 27/42, 64%; 23/44, 52%; and 27/42, 64% for levels 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively). The percentage of men who reported being very satisfied was highest among level 4 participants (10/42, 24% vs 4/39, 10%; 5/42, 12%; and 5/44, 11% for levels 1, 2, and 3, respectively). Dissatisfaction was highest in level 1 (5/39, 13% vs 1/42, 2%; 3/44, 7%; and 2/42, 5% for levels 2, 3, and 4, respectively).

We obtained a series of ADC histogram parameters, such as ADCmean, ADCmedian, ADC25%, ADC75%, entropy, and histogram width, by processing the ADC images via the Firevoxel Post-Processing and the SPSS24 software. We compared the parameters between the high-risk and low- or moderate-risk groups as well as between the LNM-positive and LNM-negative groups of the patients, and analyzed the diagnostic performance of the parameters with statistically significant differences.  Results:   The high-risk group, compared with the low- or moderate-risk one, showed a significantly lower ADCmean (［590 ± 120］ vs ［837 ± 142］ ×10－6 mm2/s, P < 0.01), ADCmedian (［560 ± 117］ vs ［804 ± 139］ ×10－6 mm2/s, P < 0.01), ADC25% (［446.5 ± 98］ vs ［717 ± 118］ ×10－6 mm2/, P < 0.01) and ADC75% (［667 ± 132］ vs ［931 ± 167］ ×10－6 mm2/s, P < 0.01).

Results:   In total, we included seven patients undergoing pelvic exenteration or extended pelvic resection. The mean operative time was 485±157 minutes and median length of stay was 9 days (6-34 days). There was only one Clavien-Dindo complication grade 3 which was a vesicourethral anastomotic leak requiring rigid cystoscopy and bilateral ureteric catheter insertion. Eighty-five percent of patients had clear colorectal margins with a median margin of 3.5 mm (0.7-8.0 mm) while all urological margins were clear. Six out of seven patients had complete (grade 3) total mesorectal excision. Three patients experienced recurrence at a median of 22 months (21-24 months) post-operatively. Of the three recurrences, one was systemic only whilst two were both local and systemic. One patient died from complications of dual rectal and prostate cancer 31 months after the surgery.

We linked this dataset to cancer centre, hospital discharge abstracts, physicians' billing, and census data. We identified a survivor cohort (n = 12,201), then descriptively examined primary care use during follow-up care. Multivariate Poisson and negative binomial regression, respectively, were used to examine primary care use for two outcomes: total number of primary care provider (pcp) visits (all reasons) and total number of cancer-specific pcp visits.  Results:   The mean numbers of pcp visits (all reasons) and cancer-specific pcp visits per year for survivors who did not receive cancer centre follow-up (cc-fup) were 8.12 and 0.43 visits, respectively, and for survivors who continued to receive cc-fup were 8.75 and 0.63 visits, respectively. Age, cancer type, stage at diagnosis, comorbidity scores, year of diagnosis, and receipt of cc-fup were associated with both outcomes. Compared with prostate cancer survivors, breast, colorectal, and gynecologic cancer survivors had, respectively, 56%, 69%, and 56% fewer expected cancer-specific PCP visits. Receipt of cc-fup increased the expected number of pcp visits (all reasons) by 12% and cancer-specific pcp visits by 50%.

It also remains uncertain whether treatment of cases that can be treated with curative intent alters the mortality rate. There are very few studies describing the presenting stage, risk groups, and survival after diagnosis for men dying of prostate cancer in the literature. In this study, we explored these characteristics for all men who died of prostate cancer in British Columbia between 2013 and 2015.  Methods:   The population-based BC Cancer databases were used to identify all patients diagnosed between January 2013 and December 2015 who died of prostate cancer. Patient, tumour, and treatment characteristics were collected, and the risk grouping for each tumour was determined. The proportion of cases in each risk group at the time of diagnosis was determined. Survival time from diagnosis to death was calculated for all patients and for each risk group using the Kaplan-Meier method.  Results:   A total of 1256 patients died of prostate cancer. Of patients who presented with metastatic disease, 57.2% presented with a Gleason score of 8 or more, compared with only 35.7% of patients who presented with nonmetastatic disease (p < 0.0001). The presenting stage and risk group of those dying of prostate cancer were as follows: 32% metastatic disease, 3% regional (defined as node-positive), 39% localized high risk, 9% localized intermediate risk, 4% localized low risk, 6% localized not otherwise specified, and 7% unknown. Therefore, 80.3% of those with a known risk group presented with either localized high-risk, regional, or metastatic disease at diagnosis. The median survival times from diagnosis to death were 12 years for localized low-risk, 10 years for localized intermediate-risk, 6.5 years for localized high-risk, 4 years for regional, and 1.7 years for metastatic disease at diagnosis.  Conclusions:   This population-based analysis demonstrates that patients with localized high-risk, regional, or metastatic disease at diagnosis constitute the overwhelming majority of patients who die of prostate cancer in British Columbia. Unless these disease states can reliably be identified at an earlier low- or intermediate-risk localized state in the future, it is unlikely that treatment of localized low- and intermediate-risk cancer will have an impact on survival. Furthermore, patients with de novo metastatic disease had identifiable risk factors of a higher prostate-specific antigen and Gleason score. Further studies are required to confirm these results.""","""['S Parimi', 'S Bondy', 'M Aparicio', 'K Sunderland', 'J Cho', 'F Bachand', 'K Nguyen Chi', 'T Pickles', 'S Tyldesley']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Curr Oncol""","""['Adenocarcinoma of the prostate in Iceland: a population-based study of stage, Gleason grade, treatment and long-term survival in males diagnosed between 1983 and 1987.', 'Prostate-Specific Antigen-Based Screening for Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Evidence Review for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force Internet.', 'Total Medicare Costs Associated With Diagnosis and Treatment of Prostate Cancer in Elderly Men.', 'Age dependence of modern clinical risk groups for localized prostate cancer-A population-based study.', 'Gleason 6 Prostate Cancer: Translating Biology into Population Health.', 'Causes of Death Among Patients With Metastatic Prostate Cancer in the US From 2000 to 2016.', 'Prostate Cancer Lesions by Zone and Race: Does Multiparametric MRI Demonstrate Racial Difference in Prostate Cancer Lesions for African American Men?']"""

Methods:   We developed a model to estimate attributable cancer treatment failure because of continued smoking after a cancer diagnosis (afs). Canadian health system data were used to determine the additional treatment cost for afs for the most common cancers in Canada.  Results:   Of 206,000 patients diagnosed with cancer annually, an estimated 4789 experienced afs. The annual incremental cost associated with treating patients experiencing afs was estimated at between $198 million and $295 million (2017 Canadian dollars), reflecting an added incremental cost of $4,810-$7,162 per patient who continued to smoke. Analyses according to disease site demonstrated higher incremental costs where the smoking prevalence and the cost of individual second-line cancer treatment were highest. Of breast, prostate, colorectal, and lung cancers, lung cancer was associated with the highest incremental cost for treatment after afs.

Methods:   We enrolled 58 patients undergoing RALP and 22 patients undergoing robot-assisted partial nephrectomy (RAPN) (control group) in our study. Demographic patient data and intraoperative parameters including cerebral oxygenation and cerebral hemodynamics were recorded for all patients.

Results:   Our results demonstrated that CAB exerted considerably cytotoxic and apoptotic effects on PC-3 mCRPC cells (p < 0.05). CAB treatment altered TLR4 expression level in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, 1 nM CAB treatment significantly induced NF-κB activity through p65 nuclear localization and increased the expression level of caspase-3, Bax and p53. Interestingly, total apoptotic cell death and IRF3 protein levels were increased at 5 nM concentration of CAB despite a decrease in the levels of both NF-κB and pro-apoptotic genes.

In this work, an integrated strategy of multiplex tags chemical isotope labeling (MTCIL) combined with magnetic dispersive solid phase extraction (MDSPE), was proposed for specific extraction and high-throughput determination of sarcosine by ultra high performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS). In the past three months, we have developed 8-plex MTCIL reagents with excellent qualitative and quantitative performance. In this work, the multiplexing capacity of MTCIL reagents (MTCIL360/361/362/363/364/365/366/375/376/378/379/381) was increased 1.5-fold from 8-plex to 12-plex. MTCIL359 was prepared and used to label sarcosine standard as internal standard (IS). The structural analogue derivative (MTCIL373-sarcosine) of all targeted MTCIL-sarcosine derivatives was synthesized and used as a novel dummy template to prepare dummy magnetic molecularly imprinted polymers (DMMIPs). The integration of MTCIL and DMMIPs procedures were extremely favorable to excellent chromatographic separation and efficient mass spectrometric detection. The labeling efficiency, chromatographic retention and mass spectrometry responses of MTCIL reagents were consistent for sarcosine. In a single UHPLC-MS/MS run (2.0 min), this method can simultaneously quantify sarcosine in 12-plex urine samples and achieve unbiased concentrations comparison between different urine samples. Analytical parameters including linearity (R2 0.989-0.997), detection limits (0.02 nM), precision (2.6-11.5%), accuracy (96.1-107.4%), matrix effect, labeling and extraction efficiency were carefully validated. The proposed method was successfully applied for urinary sarcosine determination of healthy male individuals and Pca patients. It was found that the sarcosine concentrations in these two groups were statistically extremely significantly different (P < 0.001). The developed method was a powerful analytical tool to substantially promote the analysis throughput and large-scale experiments about the potential biomarker research.""","""['Shi-En Chen', 'Jingwen Hu', 'Ping Yan', 'Jing Sun', 'Wenhui Jia', 'Shuyun Zhu', 'Xian-En Zhao', 'Huwei Liu']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Talanta""","""['8-Plex stable isotope labeling absolute quantitation strategy combined with dual-targeted recognizing function material for simultaneous separation and determination of glucosylsphingosine and galactosylsphingosine in human plasma.', 'Derivatization-based magnetic dummy molecularly imprinted polymers integrated with 4-plex stable isotope labeling derivatization strategy for specific and rapid determination of L-hydroxyproline in human serum.', '13-Plex UHPLC-MS/MS Analysis of Hexanal and Heptanal Using Multiplex Tags Chemical Isotope Labeling Technology.', 'Multiplexed derivatization strategy-based dummy molecularly imprinted polymers as sorbents for magnetic dispersive solid phase extraction of globotriaosylsphingosine prior to UHPLC-MS/MS quantitation.', 'Translational Metabolomics of Head Injury: Exploring Dysfunctional Cerebral Metabolism with Ex Vivo NMR Spectroscopy-Based Metabolite Quantification.', 'Recent molecularly imprinted polymers applications in bioanalysis.', 'Molecularly imprinted polymers for selective extraction/microextraction of cancer biomarkers: A review.']"""

The aim of this study was to analyse trends in incidence and mortality for the most common types of cancer in the canton of Zurich from 1981 to 2017.  Methods:   In this analysis of population-based cancer registry data, we included malignant tumours of the breast (ICD10 C50), prostate (C61), colon/rectum (C18&ndash;C21), lung (C33&ndash;C34), and melanoma (C43), diagnosed between 1981 and 2017. Age-standardised incidence and mortality rates per 100,000 person-years were computed using the 1976 European Standard Population. Incidence and mortality time trends were assessed using joinpoint regression analysis.  Results:   In men, incidence for prostate cancer and melanoma increased over the study period, while it decreased for colon/rectum and lung cancer. A joinpoint for prostate cancer indicated the start of a decreasing trend in 2002. In women, incidence increased for breast cancer, lung cancer and melanoma; no trend was observed for colon/rectum cancer. Cancer mortality decreased for prostate, colon/rectum and lung cancer in men, with no clear trend for melanoma. In women, mortality decreased for breast cancer, colon/rectum cancer and melanoma, but increased for lung cancer.  Conclusions:   The overall increasing incidence trends for prostate and breast cancer, as well as for melanoma, are in line with data from other Western countries. While lung cancer incidence is decreasing in men, it is still on the rise in women. Despite increasing incidence rates, mortality rates are decreasing for all localisations except for lung cancer in women. The opposite direction of incidence and mortality curves is probably mostly due to better and more effective treatment options, as well as earlier detection.""","""['Miriam Wanner', 'Katarina Luise Matthes', 'Nena Karavasiloglou', 'Manuela Limam', 'Dimitri Korol', 'Sabine Rohrmann']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Swiss Med Wkly""","""['Incidence trends and clinical-pathological characteristics of invasive cutaneous melanoma from 1980 to 2010 in the Canton of Zurich, Switzerland.', 'Recent trends in cancer incidence: impact of risk factors, diagnostic activities and data quality of registration.', 'Variation in incidence of breast, lung and cervical cancer and malignant melanoma of skin by socioeconomic group in England.', 'Indicators of Data Quality at the Cancer Registry Zurich and Zug in Switzerland.', 'Cancer incidence and mortality in the Greater Poland Region-Analysis of the year 2010 and future trends.', 'Breast cancer and occupation: Non-parametric and parametric net survival analyses among Swiss women (1990-2014).']"""

A nationwide population cohort study was conducted involving newly diagnosed patients with Pca %who started ADT with GnRHa (GnRHa users, n = 3,201) and control (nonusers, n = 4,123) between January 1, 2012, and December 31, 2016, using data from the National Health Insurance Service.

Traditional and propensity score-matched Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate the effects of ADT on the risk of dementia and Parkinson's disease. In univariable analysis, risk of dementia was associated with GnRHa use in both nationwide and hospital validation cohort (hazard ratio [HR], 1.696; 95% CI, 1.425-2.019, and HR, 1.352; 95% CI, 1.089-1.987, respectively). In a nationwide cohort, ADT was not associated with dementia in both traditional and propensity score-matched multivariable analysis, whereas in a hospital validation cohort, ADT was associated with dementia only in unmatched analysis (HR, 1.203; 95% CI, 1.021-1.859) but not in propensity score-matched analysis.

Loss of DACH1 expression is associated with poor prognostic features and reduced overall survival in uterine cancer. In this study, we utilized the Oncology Research Information Exchange Network (ORIEN) Avatar database to determine the frequency of DACH1 mutations in patients with endometrial cancer in our Kentucky population.  Methods:   We obtained clinical and genomic data for 65 patients with endometrial cancer from the Markey Cancer Center (MCC). We examined the clinical attributes of the cancers by DACH1 status by comparing whole-exome sequencing (WES), RNA Sequencing (RNASeq), microsatellite instability (MSI), and tumor mutational burden (TMB).  Results:   Kentucky women with endometrial cancer had an increased frequency of DACH1 mutations (12/65 patients, 18.5%) compared to The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) endometrial cancer population (25/586 patients, 3.8%) with p-value = 1.04E-05. DACH1 mutations were associated with increased tumor mutation count in both TCGA (median 65 vs. 8972, p-value = 7.35E-09) and our Kentucky population (490 vs. 2160, p-value = 6.0E-04). DACH1 mutated patients have a higher tumor mutation burden compared to DACH1 wild-type (24 vs. 6.02, p-value = 4.29E-05). DACH1 mutations showed significant gene co-occurrence patterns with POLE, MLH1, and PMS2. DACH1 mutations were not associated with an increase in microsatellite instability at MCC (MSI-H) (p-value = 0.1342).  Conclusions:   DACH1 mutations are prevalent in Kentucky patients with endometrial cancer. These mutations are associated with high tumor mutational burden and co-occur with genome destabilizing gene mutations. These findings suggest DACH1 may be a candidate biomarker for future trials with immunotherapy, particularly in endometrial cancers.""","""['McKayla J Riggs', 'Nan Lin', 'Chi Wang', 'Dava W Piecoro', 'Rachel W Miller', 'Oliver A Hampton', 'Mahadev Rao', 'Frederick R Ueland', 'Jill M Kolesar']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Analysis of 108 patients with endometrial carcinoma using the PROMISE classification and additional genetic analyses for MMR-D.', 'Clinical impact of endometrial cancer stratified by genetic mutational profiles, POLE mutation, and microsatellite instability.', 'Polymerase ɛ (POLE) mutations in endometrial cancer: clinical outcomes and implications for Lynch syndrome testing.', 'Universal endometrial cancer tumor typing: How much has immunohistochemistry, microsatellite instability, and MLH1 methylation improved the diagnosis of Lynch syndrome across the population?', 'Mismatch repair deficiency testing in clinical practice.', 'Study of DACH1 Expression and its Epigenetic Regulators as Possible Breast Cancer-Related Biomarkers.', 'Value added by an inter-continental cancer consortium.']"""

To date, no studies have examined the potential role of inflammation in the development of these symptoms in ADT recipients. The goal of the current study was to examine circulating markers of inflammation as potential mediators of change in fatigue, depressive symptomatology, and cognitive impairment related to the receipt of ADT.  Methods:   Patients treated with ADT for prostate cancer (ADT+; n = 47) were assessed around the time of the initiation of ADT and 6 and 12 months later. An age- and education-matched group of men without a history of cancer (CA-; n = 82) was assessed at comparable time points. Fatigue, depressive symptomatology, and cognitive impairment were assessed with the Fatigue Symptom Inventory, the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale, and a battery of neuropsychological tests, respectively. Circulating markers of inflammation included interleukin 1 receptor antagonist (IL-1RA), interleukin 6 (IL-6), soluble tumor necrosis factor receptor II (sTNF-RII), and C-reactive protein (CRP).  Results:   Fatigue, depressive symptomatology, and serum IL-6 increased significantly over time in the ADT+ group versus the CA- group; rates of cognitive impairment also changed significantly between the groups. No significant changes in IL-1RA, sTNF-RII, or CRP over time were detected. Treatment-related increases in IL-6 were associated with worsening fatigue but not depressive symptomatology or cognitive impairment.  Conclusions:   Results of this preliminary study suggest that increases in circulating IL-6, perhaps due to testosterone inhibition, may play a role in fatigue secondary to receipt of ADT.

Cancer history is an important factor to consider in the provision of primary care, yet little is known about the completeness or accuracy of cancer history data contained in CHC electronic health records (EHRs).  Methods:   We probabilistically linked EHR data from more than1.5 million adult CHC patients to state cancer registries in California, Oregon, and Washington and estimated measures of agreement (eg, kappa, sensitivity, specificity). We compared demographic and clinical characteristics of cancer patients as estimated by each data source, evaluating distributional differences with absolute standardized mean differences.  Results:   A total 74 707 cancer patients were identified between the 2 sources (EHR only, n = 22 730; registry only, n = 23 616; both, n = 28 361). Nearly one-half of cancer patients identified in registries were missing cancer documentation in the EHR. Overall agreement of cancer ascertainment in the EHR vs cancer registries (gold standard) was moderate (kappa = 0.535). Cancer site-specific agreement ranged from substantial (eg, prostate and female breast; kappa > 0.60) to fair (melanoma and cervix; kappa < 0.40). Comparing population characteristics of cancer patients as ascertained from each data source, groups were similar for sex, age, and federal poverty level, but EHR-recorded cases showed greater medical complexity than those ascertained from cancer registries.  Conclusions:   Agreement between EHR and cancer registry data was moderate and varied by cancer site. These findings suggest the need for strategies to improve capture of cancer history information in CHC EHRs to ensure adequate delivery of care and optimal health outcomes for cancer survivors.""","""['Megan Hoopes', 'Robert Voss', 'Heather Angier', 'Miguel Marino', 'Teresa Schmidt', 'Jennifer E DeVoe', 'Jeffrey Soule', 'Nathalie Huguet']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""J Natl Cancer Inst""","""['Rapid Development of Specialty Population Registries and Quality Measures from Electronic Health Record Data*.

During the follow-up period, the patients received detection of the serum PSA level before treatment and chest x-ray and whole-body bone scan every six months. After two courses of treatment, the patients were observed for the changes in the serum PSA level, relief of bone pain, quality of survival, overall survival rate, overall survival time and toxic reactions. The protocol was continued unless the patient underwent progression, refused for unacceptable toxicity, or died.  Results:   The patients were aged 59 to 79 (mean 68.80±5.67) years old, with the serum PSA level of (28.05 ± 3.22) μg/L at the baseline and (4.12 ± 0.23) μg/L after treatment. Thirty-eight of the patients were followed up for 3 to 33 (mean 12.2) months. PSA-based evaluation showed therapeutic effectiveness in 14 cases (35%), stable condition in 21 (52.5 %) and progression in 5 (12.5 %). Of the 18 patients with bone metastasis and pain, 16 (88.9 %) experienced relief of the symptoms and reduced the use of painkillers, with the bone pain scores of 5.20 ± 1.22 vs 2.79 ± 0.57 before and after treatment. By the end of the follow-up, the overall survival rate was 55.0% (22/40) and the median survival time was 17 months (95% CI: 13.4－24.6). During the treatment, no obvious adverse reactions were observed except for anemia in 1 case and hair loss in another.  Conclusions:   For the treatment of CRPC in China, the 3-week paclitaxel liposome protocol has the advantages of desirable safety, low toxicity, acceptable drug tolerance and improved quality of survival, but its curative effect needs to be verified with more randomized clinical trials with larger samples and longer follow-ups.""","""['Shu-Su Zhu', 'Fang-Yuan Zhang', 'Song Xue', 'Xiao-Qing Sun']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Zhonghua Nan Ke Xue""","""['Phase 2 Study of Weekly Paclitaxel Plus Estramustine in Metastatic Hormone-Refractory Prostate Carcinoma: ECOG-ACRIN Cancer Research Group (E1898) Trial.', 'Serum alkaline phosphatase differentiates prostate-specific antigen flare from early disease progression after docetaxel chemotherapy in castration-resistant prostate cancer with bone metastasis.', 'Efficacy and Safety of Carboplatin Plus Paclitaxel as the First-, Second-, and Third-line Chemotherapy in Men With Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Re-treatment with radium-223: 2-year follow-up from an international, open-label, phase 1/2 study in patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer and bone metastases.', 'EAU guidelines on prostate cancer.

Multiparametric TRUS, including SWE, was performed to all patients with the use of the Aixplorer ultrasound system (Supersonic Imagine, France), followed by TRUS guided 12-samples systematic prostate biopsy in combination with targeted biopsy from hypoechoic and/or stiff areas according to SWE data. Comparison of the results of histological examination and tissue stiffness measurements were carried out according to the specimens and patients. A total of 2 171 biopsy samples were analyzed (1 968 systematic and 203 targeted). After morphological evaluation all specimens were divided into groups of PCa+ (n=441) and PCa- (n=1 730), and patients to the group of PCa (n=74) and the control group (n=90).  Results:   PCa was found in 17.3% of systematic biopsy specimens and in 76.9% of SWE targeted biopsy specimens (P<0.0001). The significant moderate positive correlations of Youngs modulus and Gleason scores (rS=0.51, P<0.0001), Youngs modulus and% specimen involvement (rS=0.59, P<0.0001) were founded in the group of PCa+ biopsy specimens. The percentage of PCa+ specimens was significantly higher with any types of targeted biopsy, than with systematic biopsy. With SWE targeted biopsy the percentage of PCa+ specimens was significantly higher than with B-mode guided targeted biopsy. Similar regularities were observed when comparing these types of targeted biopsy according to morphological prognostic ISUP groups and perineural invasion. Performing of targeted biopsy increased the morphological prognostic group in 5.4% of patients, additionally revealed perineural invasion in 2.7% of patients with PCa, and transferred additional 9.5% of patients from the group of clinically insignificant to the group of clinically significant PCa.  Conclusion:   SWE-guided targeted biopsy shows the significantly higher positive biopsy rate than conventional systematic biopsy.

Methods:   Daily kV-CBCT imaging was used for online setup-correction in six degrees of freedom (6-dof) for 24 patients receiving definitive (12 RTdef patients) or postoperative (12 RTpostop patients) radiotherapy with endorectal balloon (overall 739 CBCTs). Residual deviations were evaluated using several spatial and dosimetric variables, including: (a) posterior Hausdorff distance HDpost (=maximum distance between planned and daily CTV contour), (b) point Pworst with largest HDpost over all fractions, (c) equivalent uniform dose using a cell survival model (EUDSF ) and the generalized EUD concept (gEUDa with parameter a = -7 and a = -20). EUD values were determined for planned ( EUD SF plan ), daily ( EUD SF ind ), and delivered dose distributions ( EUD SF accum ) for plans with 6 mm (=clinical plans) and 2 mm CTV-to-PTV margin. Time series analyses of interfractional spatial and dosimetric deviations were conducted.  Results:   Large HDpost values ≥ 12.5 mm (≥15 mm) were observed in 20/739 (5/739) fractions distributed across 7 (3) patients. Points Pworst were predominantly located at the posterior CTV boundary in the seminal vesicle region (16/24 patients, 6/7 patients with HDpost ≥ 12.5 mm). Time series analyses revealed a stationary white noise characteristic of HDpost and relative dose at Pworst . The EUDSF difference between planned and accumulated dose distributions was < 5.4% for all 6-mm plans. Evaluating 2-mm plans, EUDSF deteriorated by < 10% (<5%) in 75% (58.5%) of the patients. EUD SF accum was well described by the median value of the EUD SF ind distribution. PTV margin calculation at Pworst yielded 8.8 mm.  Conclusions:   Accumulated dose distributions in prostate radiotherapy with endorectal balloon are forgiving of considerable residual distortions after 6-dof patient setup if they are observed in a minority of fractions and the median value of EUD SF ind determined per fraction stays within 95% of prescribed dose. Common PTV margin calculations are overly conservative because after online correction of translational and rotational errors only residual deformations need to be included.

The sensitivity and specificity of each AF were calculated. Inter-reader agreement was evaluated using κ statistics. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were conducted to determine significant AFs. The reduction in positive call rates and csPCa detection rates with combined AF use were calculated and compared with the findings obtained with PI-RADS use alone. The sensitivities and specificities of the AFs indicating csPCa were 72.1%-96.5% and 27.4%-75.2% for reader 1, 66.3%-96.5% and 23.9%-62.0% for reader 2, and 67.4%-96.5% and 34.5%-78.8% for reader 3, with moderate to substantial inter-reader agreement (Fleiss κ, 0.551-0.643). The combined use of two or more AFs for assessing PI-RADS ≥3 lesions resulted in a 19.6%-30.7% reduction in positive calls (p < .05) compared to PI-RADS use alone while preserving the csPCa detection rates (p ≥ .06) for three readers. The use of AFs in combination with PI-RADS can reduce positive calls and false positives without csPCa under-detection.""","""['Chul-Min Lee', 'Kye Jin Park', 'Mi-Hyun Kim', 'Jeong Kon Kim']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""J Magn Reson Imaging""","""['Magnetic Resonance Imaging Radiomics-Based Machine Learning Prediction of Clinically Significant Prostate Cancer in Equivocal PI-RADS 3 Lesions.', 'Effects of dynamic contrast enhancement on diffusion weighted imaging score of 3 in prostate imaging reporting and data system version 2 of peripheral zone.', 'Comparison of diagnostic performance and inter-reader agreement between PI-RADS v2.1 and PI-RADS v2: systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Contribution of Dynamic Contrast-enhanced and Diffusion MRI to PI-RADS for Detecting Clinically Significant Prostate Cancer.', 'MRI in early prostate cancer detection: how to manage indeterminate or equivocal PI-RADS 3 lesions?']"""

Although numerous indicators have been identified as having prognostic value for lung cancer and liver metastasis, liver metastases are still not diagnosed by imaging in many patients. To provide a more accurate method for clinical prediction of liver metastasis, we analyzed multiple factors to identify potential predictive factors for liver metastasis of lung cancer.  Methods:   Patients first diagnosed with lung cancer between 2002 and 2016 (n = 1746) were divided into two groups, with and without liver metastasis. Serum concentrations of calcium, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), cancer antigen-125 (CA125), cancer antigen-153 (CA153), carbohydrate antigen-199 (CA199), cytokeratin fraction 21-1 (CYFRA21-1), total prostate-specific antigen (TPSA), and neuron-specific enolase (NSE) were analyzed in both patient groups.  Results:   There was no significant difference in age or sex between the two groups. CA125 and NSE were significantly associated with liver metastasis. Compared with CA125, NSE was more specific, while it was less sensitive (P < 0.001). Further analysis of NSE concentrations was conducted in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer and indicated that NSE concentration differed significantly between those with and without liver metastasis (P = 0.023). We conducted analysis with NSE and CA125 combined, resulting in acceptable sensitivity (51.2%), specificity (72.6%), and area under the curve (0.64) values; sensitivity and area under the curve values were higher than those for individual factors, while specificity was higher than that for CA125.  Conclusions:   The combination of CA125 and NSE can assist prediction of liver metastasis of lung cancer, providing improved diagnostic accuracy.""","""['Chu-Feng Wang', 'Sheng-Jia Peng', 'Rong-Qiang Liu', 'Ya-Jie Yu', 'Qian-Min Ge', 'Rong-Bin Liang', 'Qiu-Yu Li', 'Biao Li', 'Yi Shao']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Dis Markers""","""['The important role of circulating CYFRA21-1 in metastasis diagnosis and prognostic value compared with carcinoembryonic antigen and neuron-specific enolase in lung cancer patients.', ""Retrospective Study to Determine Diagnostic Utility of 6 Commonly Used Lung Cancer Biomarkers Among Han and Uygur Population in Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region of People's Republic of China."", 'Lactate dehydrogenase and serum tumor markers for predicting metastatic status in geriatric patients with lung adenocarcinoma.', 'History, molecular features, and clinical importance of conventional serum biomarkers in lung cancer.', 'Biomarkers along the continuum of care in lung cancer.', 'Liquid Biopsy in Lung Cancer: Biomarkers for the Management of Recurrence and Metastasis.', 'Expression changes and clinical significance of serum neuron-specific enolase and squamous cell carcinoma antigen in lung cancer patients after radiotherapy.', 'The value of serum TRAP1 in diagnosing small cell lung cancer and tumor immunity.', 'Changes in lung cancer-related serum tumor markers in patients with chronic kidney disease and determination of upper reference limit.', 'The Potential Role of MUC16 (CA125) Biomarker in Lung Cancer: A Magic Biomarker but with Adversity.']"""

However, novel treatment methods are gradually being introduced. Considering the adverse effects of traditional treatments, recent studies have investigated gene therapy as a method to combat CRPC; but, the application of long non-coding (lnc) RNA in gene therapy remains scarce, despite their promise. Therefore, it is imperative to develop a system that can efficiently deliver lncRNA for the treatment of CRPC. Here, we investigated the efficacy of a delivery system by introducing the plasmid-encoding tumor suppressor lncRNA MEG3 (pMEG3) in CRPC cells.  Materials and methods:   An EpDT3 aptamer-linked poly(amidoamine) (PAMAM) dendrimer targeting EpCAM was used to deliver pMEG3 in CRPC cells. The PAMAM-PEG-EpDT3/pMEG3 nanoparticles (NPs) were tested using in vitro cellular assays including cellular uptake, entry, and CCK-8 measurement, and tumor growth inhibition, histological assessment, and safety evaluations in in vivo animal models.  Results:   The EpDT3 aptamer promoted endocytosis of PAMAM and PAMAM-PEG-EpDT3/pMEG3 NPs in CRPC cells. PAMAM-PEG-EpDT3/pMEG3 NPs exhibited a significant anti-CRPC effect, both in vivo and in vitro, when compared to that of unfunctionalized PAMAM-PEG/pMEG3 NPs.  Conclusion:   PAMAM-PEG-EpDT3/pMEG3 NPs can potentially improve gene therapy in CRPC cells.""","""['Zongguang Tai#', 'Jinyuan Ma#', 'Jianing Ding#', 'Huijun Pan', 'Rongrong Chai', 'Congcong Zhu', 'Zhen Cui', 'Zhongjian Chen', 'Quangang Zhu']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Int J Nanomedicine""","""['Plasmid pORF-hTRAIL targeting to glioma using transferrin-modified polyamidoamine dendrimer.', 'Co-delivery of doxorubicin and TRAIL plasmid by modified PAMAM dendrimer in colon cancer cells, in vitro and in vivo evaluation.', 'Dual targeting effect of Angiopep-2-modified, DNA-loaded nanoparticles for glioma.', 'Poly (amidoamine) (PAMAM) dendrimer mediated delivery of drug and pDNA/siRNA for cancer therapy.', 'PEGylated PAMAM dendrimers: Enhancing efficacy and mitigating toxicity for effective anticancer drug and gene delivery.', 'A review of current evidence about lncRNA MEG3: A tumor suppressor in multiple cancers.', 'Long Non-coding RNA Therapeutics: Recent Advances and Challenges.', 'Insights into Aptamer-Drug Delivery Systems against Prostate Cancer.', 'Application progress of RVG peptides to facilitate the delivery of therapeutic agents into the central nervous system.', 'Bone marrow adiposity during pathologic bone loss: molecular mechanisms underlying the cellular events.']"""

Our analysis of the structural variability of the TMPRSS2 gene based on genome-wide data from 76 human populations demonstrates that a functionally significant missense mutation in exon 6/7 in the TMPRSS2 gene is found in many human populations at relatively high frequencies, with region-specific distribution patterns. The frequency of the missense mutation encoded by rs12329760, which has previously been found to be associated with prostate cancer, ranged between 10% and 63% and was significantly higher in populations of Asian origin compared with European populations. In addition to single-nucleotide polymorphisms, two copy number variants were detected in the TMPRSS2 gene. A number of microRNAs have been predicted to regulate TMPRSS2 and BSG expression levels, but none of them is enriched in lung or respiratory tract cells. Several well-studied drugs can downregulate the expression of TMPRSS2 in human cells, including acetaminophen (paracetamol) and curcumin.

Computational analysis was made considering expression changes occurring in metabolic markers following MALAT1 targeting in cultured OSCs. MALAT1 silencing reduced expression of some metabolic enzymes, including malic enzyme 3, pyruvate dehydrogenase kinases 1 and 3, and choline kinase A. Consequently, PCa metabolism switched toward a glycolytic phenotype characterized by increased lactate production paralleled by growth arrest and cell death. Conversely, the function of mitochondrial succinate dehydrogenase and the expression of oxidative phosphorylation enzymes were markedly reduced. A similar effect was observed in OSCs.

Current methods based on the analysis of plasma present the disadvantage of the fast degradation of the analytes in the liquid sample. Dried blood spots (DBS) consist of a minimally invasive and unexplored sampling strategy to monitor the levels of abiraterone (ABI) and delta(4)-abiraterone (D4A) in patients. This study presents the development and validation of a precise and accurate method to monitor ABI and D4A in DBS samples by UPLC-MS/MS. Bioanalytical method validation was carried out according to current guidelines, evaluating the impact of DBS-specific parameters such as hematocrit and spot volume on accuracy. Based on the analysis of quality control samples prepared at low, medium and high concentrations, the method was precise with CV ≤ 6.97 % and 10.26 % for ABI and D4A, respectively. The method was also highly accurate, between 93.6-106.8 % for ABI and 96.0-108.5 % for D4A. The DBS method is compatible with the analysis of samples of unknown volume and hematocrit range of the studied population. In addition, ABI and D4A were stable for 7 days in DBS at room temperature, which is feasible for sample transportation in postal service and analysis in the laboratory. Method application to 16 clinical samples revealed good correlation between measured plasma concentrations and estimated plasma concentrations for ABI (r = 0.884, P < 0.05) and D4A (r = 0.920, P < 0.05). Passing-Bablok regression analysis and Bland-Altmann plots indicated correlation between the results obtained from DBS and plasma, with a slight overestimation of the concentrations of ABI in DBS, which could be related to the small study cohort.

Profiles were identified by age, marital status, race, county of residence (non-Appalachian or Appalachian), and health insurance type (none/self-pay, public, or private) reported in the Tennessee Department of Health cancer registry from 2005 to 2015 for adults ≥18 years (N = 18,088). We identified three risk profiles. The highest surgical delay profile (11% of the sample) with a 30% likelihood of delaying surgery >90 days were young Black men, <55 years old, living in a non-Appalachian county, and single/never married, with a high probability of having private health insurance. The medium surgical delay profile (46% of the sample) with a 21% likelihood of delay were 55-69 years old, White, married, and having private health insurance. The lowest surgical delay profile (42% of the sample) with a 14% likelihood of delay were ≥70 years with public health insurance as well as had a high probability of being White and married.

We first looked for a possible correlation of 99m Tc-HDP lesion uptake in pretreatment whole-body scans (WBSs) with lesion absorbed dose. Moreover, we looked for a possible correlation of 99m Tc-HDP lesion uptake in pretreatment WBSs and of lesion absorbed dose with relative change in the 99m Tc-HDP lesion uptake obtained from pre- and post-treatment WBSs in patients treated for mCRPC with six cycles of 223 Ra-Cl2 .  Methods:   Eleven patients received six cycles of 55 kBq/kg of 223 Ra-Cl2 separated by 4 weeks. In addition, one patient received concomitant treatment with abiraterone and two patients with enzalutamide. The 99m Tc-HDP WBSs were acquired before the first cycle and after the sixth cycle of the treatment. For the lesions with the higher 99m Tc-HDP uptake, the absorbed dose was calculated for the first cycle. Lesion volume was determined from 99m Tc-HDP SPECT/CT images before the first cycle and 223 Ra-Cl2 activity in the lesions was determined from 223 Ra-Cl2 planar images after the first cycle. The effect of the treatment was evaluated from the relative change of the mean and the maximum counts in the lesions, both estimated from the WBSs acquired before the first cycle and after the sixth cycle.  Results:   The absorbed dose was calculated for 30 lesions, with values ranging between 0.4 and 3.8 Gy (mean 1.5 Gy). A significant (P < 0.05) high positive linear correlation was found between the lesion absorbed dose in the first treatment cycle and the mean and maximum counts in the lesions in the WBSs acquired before the first cycle (R = 0.75 and 0.76, respectively). The relative change of the mean and the maximum counts in the lesions in the 99m Tc-HDP WBSs showed a significant (P < 0.05) high positive logarithmic correlation with the 99m Tc-HDP mean and maximum counts in the lesions before the first cycle (R = 0.79 and 0.78, respectively). Lastly, a significant (P < 0.05) high positive logarithmic correlation was also found between the relative change of the mean and the maximum counts in the lesions in the 99m Tc-HDP WBSs and the lesion absorbed dose (R = 0.86 and 0.85, respectively). For this correlation the influence of the administered activity and of the concomitant treatments was not found to be significant (P > 0.05).  Conclusions:   The high correlations found for the 99m Tc-HDP lesion uptake before the first cycle lesion with the relative change in the 99m Tc-HDP lesion uptake after the six cycles of 223 Ra-Cl2 , and with the lesion absorbed dose in the first cycle show the potential of pretreatment 99m Tc-HDP imaging in order to personalize the performance of these treatments.""","""['Pablo Mínguez', 'Emilia Rodeño', 'Irache Fernández', 'Alba Esteban', 'Lorea Martínez-Indart', 'Alfonso Gómez de Iturriaga']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Detection and quantification of 223Ra uptake in bone metastases of patients with castration resistant prostate carcinoma, with the aim of determining the absorbed dose in the metastases.', 'The potential of 223Ra and 18F-fluoride imaging to predict bone lesion response to treatment with 223Ra-dichloride in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Dosimetry of bone metastases in targeted radionuclide therapy with alpha-emitting (223)Ra-dichloride.', '(99m)Tc-Annexin A5 quantification of apoptotic tumor response: a systematic review and meta-analysis of clinical imaging trials.', 'Use of gamma correction pinhole bone scans in trauma.', 'Personalized Dosimetry in Targeted Radiation Therapy: A Look to Methods, Tools and Critical Aspects.']"""

Combining in vivo CRISPR-based CDK4 and CDK6 gene editing with pharmacologic inhibition approaches in orthotopic transplantation and patient-derived xenograft preclinical models, we defined clear functions for CDK4 and CDK6 in facilitating tumor growth and progression in metastatic cancers. Transcriptomic profiling of CDK4/6 CRISPR knockouts in breast cancer revealed these two kinases to regulate cancer progression through distinct mechanisms. CDK4 regulated prometastatic inflammatory cytokine signaling, whereas CDK6 mainly controlled DNA replication and repair processes. Inhibition of CDK6 but not CDK4 resulted in defective DNA repair and increased DNA damage. Multiple CDK6 DNA replication/repair genes were not only associated with cancer subtype, grades, and poor clinical outcomes, but also facilitated primary tumor growth and metastasis in vivo. CRISPR-based genomic deletion of CDK6 efficiently blocked tumor formation and progression in preestablished cell- and patient-derived xenograft preclinical models of breast cancer, providing a potential novel targeted therapy for these deadly tumors.

How tumors co-opt inflammatory signaling while evading immune surveillance remains unknown. Here, we show that the ectonucleotidase ENPP1 promotes metastasis by selectively degrading extracellular cGAMP, an immune-stimulatory metabolite whose breakdown products include the immune suppressor adenosine. ENPP1 loss suppresses metastasis, restores tumor immune infiltration, and potentiates response to immune checkpoint blockade in a manner dependent on tumor cGAS and host STING. Conversely, overexpression of wild-type ENPP1, but not an enzymatically weakened mutant, promotes migration and metastasis, in part through the generation of extracellular adenosine, and renders otherwise sensitive tumors completely resistant to immunotherapy. In human cancers, ENPP1 expression correlates with reduced immune cell infiltration, increased metastasis, and resistance to anti-PD-1/PD-L1 treatment. Thus, cGAMP hydrolysis by ENPP1 enables chromosomally unstable tumors to transmute cGAS activation into an immune-suppressive pathway. SIGNIFICANCE: Chromosomal instability promotes metastasis by generating chronic tumor inflammation. ENPP1 facilitates metastasis and enables tumor cells to tolerate inflammation by hydrolyzing the immunotransmitter cGAMP, preventing its transfer from cancer cells to immune cells.This article is highlighted in the In This Issue feature, p. 995.""","""['Jun Li#', 'Mercedes A Duran#', 'Ninjit Dhanota', 'Walid K Chatila', 'Sarah E Bettigole', 'John Kwon', 'Roshan K Sriram', 'Matthew P Humphries', 'Manuel Salto-Tellez', 'Jacqueline A James', 'Matthew G Hanna', 'Johannes C Melms', 'Sreeram Vallabhaneni', 'Kevin Litchfield', 'Ieva Usaite', 'Dhruva Biswas', 'Rohan Bareja', 'Hao Wei Li', 'Maria Laura Martin', 'Princesca Dorsaint', 'Julie-Ann Cavallo', 'Peng Li', 'Chantal Pauli', 'Lee Gottesdiener', 'Benjamin J DiPardo', 'Travis J Hollmann', 'Taha Merghoub', 'Hannah Y Wen', 'Jorge S Reis-Filho', 'Nadeem Riaz', 'Shin-San Michael Su', 'Anusha Kalbasi', 'Neil Vasan', 'Simon N Powell', 'Jedd D Wolchok', 'Olivier Elemento', 'Charles Swanton', 'Alexander N Shoushtari', 'Eileen E Parkes#', 'Benjamin Izar#', 'Samuel F Bakhoum']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Cancer Discov""","""['Blockade of the Phagocytic Receptor MerTK on Tumor-Associated Macrophages Enhances P2X7R-Dependent STING Activation by Tumor-Derived cGAMP.', 'Structure-Aided Development of Small-Molecule Inhibitors of ENPP1, the Extracellular Phosphodiesterase of the Immunotransmitter cGAMP.', 'Extracellular cGAMP is a cancer cell-produced immunotransmitter involved in radiation-induced anti-cancer immunity.', ""Second messenger 2'3'-cyclic GMP-AMP (2'3'-cGAMP): Synthesis, transmission, and degradation."", 'The cGAS-cGAMP-STING pathway connects DNA damage to inflammation, senescence, and cancer.', 'Chromosomal instability and inflammation: a catch-22 for cancer cells.', 'The interplay between the DNA damage response and ectonucleotidases modulates tumor response to therapy.', 'Discovery of VH domains that allosterically inhibit ENPP1.', 'cGAMP the travelling messenger.', 'Intrinsic features of the cancer cell as drivers of immune checkpoint blockade response and refractoriness.']"""

Results:   Within a median follow-up of 86 months, 378 patients (48.0%) experienced BCR and 96 patients (12.2%) died, 42 of whom (5.3%) died of PC. GS 5 + 3 was significantly associated with worse BCR-free and cancer-specific survival, as well as higher positive surgical margin, lymph node metastasis, extraprostatic extension, and non-organ-confined disease rates, than GS 3 + 5 and higher positive surgical margin, lymph node metastasis, extraprostatic extension, and non-organ-confined disease rates than GS 4 + 4 (P < 0.05). GS 4 + 4 was significantly associated with worse BCR-free survival and higher extraprostatic extension, and non-organ-confined disease rates than GS 3 + 5 (P < 0.05). Inclusion of the different Gleason patterns improved the discrimination of a model for prediction of all survival outcomes compared to standard prognosticators.

The main challenge in the treatment of advanced neoplasm is bone metastasis and therapeutic resistance for known oncology drugs. Novel treatment methods to prolong the survival time and improve the life quality of these specific patients are required. The present study attempted to screen potential therapeutic compounds for the tumor through bioinformatics approaches, in order to provide conceptual treatment for this malignant disease.  Methods:   Differentially expressed genes were obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus database and submitted into the Connectivity Map database for the detection of potentially associated compounds. Target genes were extracted from the search results. Functional annotation and pathway enrichment were performed for the confirmation. Survival analysis was used to measure potential therapeutic effects.  Results:   It was revealed that 3 compounds (vanoxerine, tolnaftate, and gabexate) may help to prolong the disease-free survival time from tumor metastasis of patients with the tumor. A total of 6 genes [also-keto reductase family 1 member C3 (AKR1C3), collagen type III α 1 chain (COL3A1), lipoprotein lipase (LPL), glucuronidase, β pseudogene 11 (GUSBP11), apolipoprotein E (APOE), and collagen type I α 1 chain (COL1A1)] were identified to be the potential therapeutic targets for the aforementioned compounds.

Several authors have suggested the use of LC/MS instruments as an elective method for their measurement, providing good detection limits and specificity; however, many of these procedures suffer from long chromatographic run times, high detection limits and lengthy and expensive sample pre-treatment steps.  Methods:   UHPLC coupled with high-resolution Orbitrap mass spectrometry (UHPLC/Orbitrap) was set up for the identification and separation ofpolyamines, together with some of their metabolites and catabolites, in the plasma of healthy and prostate cancer human patients. Thirteen metabolites were measured in deproteinized plasma samples through a new analytical approach known as the parallel reaction monitoring (PRM) for targeted quantitative analysis.  Results:   The calibration curves were linear and R2 ranged from 0.9913 to 0.9995 for all analytes. LOQ values are between 0.382 and 25 ng mL-1 and LOD values are between 0.109 and 7.421 ng mL-1. The method shows an accuracy and precision for intra-day and inter-day < 15% RSD and R.E.% for all the QC samples. The matrix effect calculated at different concentration levels did not exceed 15%.

A univariable analysis identified several TME markers with significant impact on CR: expression of CD31 (vascular marker) in PNT stroma, expression of alpha smooth muscle actin (αSMA) in PCa stroma, and PR expression ratio between PCa stroma and PNT stroma. A multivariable model, which included CD31 expression (vascular marker) in PNT stroma and PR expression ratio between PCa stroma and PNT stroma, could significantly stratify patients for CLR, with the identification of a low risk and high-risk subgroup.

Material and methods:   By use of data from The National Prostate Cancer Register, The Prescribed Drug Registry and the Patient Registry, time on treatment with the abiraterone and enzalutamide was analyzed in all men with castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) in Sweden 2015-2019. Three time intervals between consecutive fillings, i.e. time without drug supply, were assessed. Adherence to the treatment was evaluated by use of the Medication Possession Ratio. Kaplan Meier analysis and multivariable Cox regression model were used to assess factors affecting time on treatment.  Results:   Between January 2015 and October 2019, 1803 men filled a prescription for abiraterone and 4 534 men filled a prescription for enzalutamide. With a time interval of 30 days or less between two fillings, median time on treatment was 4.9 months (IQR 2.6-11.7) for abiraterone and 8.0 months (IQR 3.6-16.4) for enzalutamide. In sensitivity analyses, allowing for no more than 14 days without drug supply between fillings, median time on treatment was 3.9 months (IQR 2.1-9.0) for abiraterone and 5.9 months (IQR 2.8-12.1) for enzalutamide.

Genomic alterations contribute to BM development; however, mutations that predispose and promote BM development are poorly understood.  Objective:   To identify differences in genomic alterations between BM and primary tumors.  Methods:   A retrospective cohort of 144 BM patients were tested for genomic alterations (85 lung, 21 breast, 14 melanoma, 4 renal, 4 colon, 3 prostate, 4 others, and 9 unknown carcinomas) by a next-generation sequencing assay interrogating 315 genes. The differences in genomic alterations between BM and primary tumors from COSMIC and TCGA were evaluated by chi-square or Fisher's exact test. Overall survival curves were plotted using the Kaplan-Meier method.  Results:   The comparison of BM and primary tumors revealed genes that were mutated in BM with increased frequency: TP53, ATR, and APC (lung adenocarcinoma); ARID1A and FGF10 (lung small-cell); PIK3CG, NOTCH3, and TET2 (lung squamous); ERBB2, BRCA2, and AXL1 (breast carcinoma); CDKN2A/B, PTEN, RUNX1T1, AXL, and FLT4 (melanoma); and ATM, AR, CDKN2A/B, TERT, and TSC1 (renal clear-cell carcinoma). Moreover, our results indicate that lung adenocarcinoma BM patients with CREBBP, GPR124, or SPTA1 mutations have a worse prognosis. Similarly, ERBB2, CDK12, or TP53 mutations are associated with worse prognosis in breast cancer BM patients.  Conclusion:   The present study demonstrates significant differences in the frequency of mutations between primary tumors and BM and identifies targetable alterations and genes that correlate with prognosis.

Despite increasing use of AS in the US, wide regional variability has been observed, and these regional variations in contemporary practice have not been well described.  Objective:   To explore variations between county and Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) regions in AS in the US.  Design, setting, and participants:   A cohort study using the SEER Prostate with Watchful Waiting (WW) database linked to the County Area Health Resource File for detailed county-level demographics and physician distribution data was conducted from January 2010 to December 2015. Analysis was performed in October 2020. A total of 79 825 men with clinically localized, low-risk prostate cancer eligible for AS or WW were included.  Exposures:   Multiple patient-, county-, and SEER region-level factors, including age, year of diagnosis, county-level densities of urologists, radiation oncologists, primary care physicians, and SEER registry region.  Main outcomes and measures:   Use of AS or WW as the initial reported treatment strategy were noted. Hierarchical mixed-effect logistic regression models were used to evaluate clustered random regional variation on use of AS or WW. Temporal trends by year in proportions of initial treatment type, as well as county-level local variation, were also estimated.  Results:   Of 79 825 men (mean [SD] age, 62.8 [7.6] years, 11 292 [14.1%] non-Hispanic Black, 7506 [9.4%] Hispanic) with low-risk prostate cancer, the mean annualized percent increase in AS rates from 2010 to 2015 ranged from 6.3% in New Mexico to 81.0% in New Jersey. Differences across SEER regions accounted for 17% of the total variation in AS. Increasing age (51-60 years: odds ratio [OR], 1.33; 95% CI, 1.21-1.46; 61-70 years: OR, 1.86; 95% CI, 1.70-2.04; 71-80 years: OR, 2.26; 95% CI, 2.05-2.50) was associated with greater odds of AS.

Black race, county-level socioeconomic factors (household income, educational level, and city type), and specialist densities were not associated with AS use.  Conclusions and relevance:   In this US cohort study based on the SEER-WW database, although the use of AS increased, considerable practice variation appeared to be associated with geographic location, but use of AS was not associated with Black race, specialty professional density, or socioeconomic factors. This small area variation underlies the broader national trends in AS practice and may inform policies aimed at continuing to affect risk-appropriate care for men throughout the US.""","""['Samuel L Washington rd', 'Chang Wook Jeong', 'Peter E Lonergan', 'Annika Herlemann', 'Scarlett L Gomez', 'Peter R Carroll', 'Matthew R Cooperberg']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""JAMA Netw Open""","""['Race/ethnicity and the receipt of watchful waiting for the initial management of prostate cancer.', ""Race/ethnicity and the intensity of medical monitoring under 'watchful waiting' for prostate cancer."", 'Urologist-Level Correlation in the Use of Observation for Low- and High-Risk Prostate Cancer.', 'Active surveillance of prostate cancer in African American men.', 'Variation and Disparity in the Use of Prostate Cancer Risk Stratification Tools in the United States.', 'Explainable ML models for a deeper insight on treatment decision for localized prostate cancer.', 'Variations in the Uptake of Active Surveillance for Prostate Cancer and Its Impact on Outcomes.', 'Complex implementation factors demonstrated when evaluating cost-effectiveness and monitoring racial disparities associated with 18FDCFPyL PET/CT in prostate cancer men.', 'A vision for closing the evidence-practice gap in the management of low-grade prostate cancer.', 'Prospective Implementation and Early Outcomes of a Risk-stratified Prostate Cancer Active Surveillance Follow-up Protocol.']"""

We investigated the chemopreventive efficacy of 5-ALA against prostate cancer using the FVB-transgenic adenocarcinoma of mouse prostate (FVB-TRAMP) model.  Methods:   Samples were collected from 24 FVB-TRAMP mice at 12 and 20 weeks of age (named the first and second sets, respectively). Sixteen mice (from the first set) were randomly allocated into 3 treatment groups: 1) control (no treatment), 2) low dose of 5-ALA (30 mg/kg/day), and 3) high dose of 5-ALA (300 mg/kg/day). Similarly, 8 mice were divided into 2 treatment groups: 1) control and 2) high dose of 5-ALA (300 mg/kg/day). 5-ALA was orally administered to mice before cancer onset, from 6 weeks of age.  Results:   In the control group, prostate cancer was pathologically detected in 33 and 50 % of mice at 12 and 20 weeks, respectively, while 25% of 12-week old mice in the low-dose group were affected and none of the high-dose group mice developed prostate cancer. Immunohistochemical analysis showed higher expression of cytochrome c oxidase subunit 4 (COX4) in the prostate gland of the high-dose group compared to the control (P = 0.018). Similarly, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using lysed prostate tissue revealed higher amounts of cytochrome c in the prostate of the high-dose group compared to the control (P = 0.021). Furthermore, western blot analysis showed higher level of cleaved caspase-3 in mice in the high-dose group diagnosed with high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia.  Conclusion:   Our results suggest that oral 5-ALA may support the functional expression of mitochondrial cytochrome c and COX4, leading to caspase 3-dependent apoptosis in carcinogenesis in FVB-TRAMP mice. Future clinical studies are warranted to confirm the chemopreventive value of 5-ALA in prostate carcinogenesis. <br />.""","""['Kenta Onishi', 'Makito Miyake', 'Yoshihiro Tatsumi', 'Shunta Hori', 'Yasushi Nakai', 'Sayuri Onishi', 'Yusuke Iemura', 'Takuya Owari', 'Yoshitaka Itami', 'Kota Iida', 'Satoshi Anai', 'Nobumichi Tanaka', 'Keiji Shimada', 'Kiyohide Fujimoto']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Asian Pac J Cancer Prev""","""['Methyl-selenium compounds inhibit prostate carcinogenesis in the transgenic adenocarcinoma of mouse prostate model with survival benefit.', 'Chemoprevention of prostate carcinogenesis by alpha-difluoromethylornithine in TRAMP mice.', 'Suppression of prostate carcinogenesis by dietary supplementation of celecoxib in transgenic adenocarcinoma of the mouse prostate model.', 'A review of the existing grading schemes and a proposal for a modified grading scheme for prostatic lesions in TRAMP mice.', 'NRF2 modulation in TRAMP mice: an in vivo model of prostate cancer.', 'Prostate diseases and microbiome in the prostate, gut, and urine.']"""

Images were assessed by two experienced physicians in order to evaluate lesion detectability and delineations that have an impact on clinical interpretation.  Results:   Of total 45 patients, 12/45 (27%) showed unremarkable scan along with 33/45 (73%) showing metastases. Sixteen out of 45 (36%) of the metastatic scans showed indeterminate/equivocal lesions. In these cases, post Lasix study showed false negative findings in 7/45 (16%), better delineation of lesions 10/45 (22%), better confidence towards reporting lesions as abnormal in 5/45 (11%) with an overall 11/45 (24%) of the cases who showed increase in the number of the lesions after the Lasix study. The overall CNR was evaluated using Wilcoxon Rank test (p-value = 0.02) which suggested significant improved ratios in the post-Lasix imaging by 49.6%±24.5. There was a substantial agreement (k =0.76) between the physicians when comparing the lesion clarity and delineation in post Lasix images. The average score for physician one and two being 2.4 ±0.71 and 2.53±0.52 respectively.  Conclusion:   Post diuretic 68Ga-PSMA imaging at ± 15 minutes clears the unwanted activity in the urinary tract which in turn improves the contrast to noise ratios. Thus leading to decline in false positive findings, improved diagnostic certainty of physician and better detection of indeterminate lesions in 68Ga-PSMA imaging.""","""['Layla Ghadanfer', 'Sharjeel Usmani', 'Fahad Marafi', 'Fareeda Al-Kandari', 'Rashid Rasheed']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Asian Pac J Cancer Prev""","""['More advantages in detecting bone and soft tissue metastases from prostate cancer using 18F-PSMA PET/CT.', 'Primary lymph-node staging with 68Ga-PSMA PET in high-risk prostate cancer: pathologic correlation with extended pelvic lymphadenectomy specimens.', 'Is there a nonnegligible effect of maximum standardized uptake value in the staging and management of prostate cancer with 68Ga-prostate-specific membrane antigen positron emission tomography/computerized tomography imaging?

The NK3 homeobox 1 (NKX3.1) protein plays important roles in prostate development and protein production, and functions as a tumor suppressor. Recently, NKX3.1 was shown to be associated with breast cancer in humans.  Methods:   Our aim was to create a new rat model to elucidate the functions of NKX3.1. To that end, we generated Nkx3.1 knockout rats using TALENs and analyzed their phenotype. TALEN-mediated Nkx3.1 knockout was confirmed by T7 endonuclease I (T7E1) assay and DNA sequencing. Prostate weight and fertility were evaluated in the knockout rats, besides determining the proportion of epithelial cells and messenger RNA (mRNA) expression of genes associated with carcinogenesis. Breast tumors were examined by histopathology.  Results:   Results suggested Nkx3.1 knockout rats have reduced fertility, decreased prostate weights, and increased epithelial cell layers. The mRNA expression of genes related to prostate carcinogenesis, namely Ar, Akt, and Pi3k, also increased. Moreover, the Nkx3.1 knockout rats often developed malignant breast tumors.  Conclusions:   We, therefore, successfully created the first Nkx3.1 knockout rat model, using TALEN-mediated gene targeting, and used it to identify defects associated with Nkx3.1 deficiency, not previously observed in mice. Loss of Nkx3.1 in rats led to lower reproductive capacity, and decreased prostate weights, apart from the risk of developing breast cancer. We, thus, proposed Nkx3.1 knockout rats as reliable models for studying the role of NKX3.1 in decreased prostate weights, fertility, and breast cancer, as well as in prostate cancer.""","""['Ji Min Lee', 'Ukjin Kim', 'Hyokyung Yang', 'Bokyeong Ryu', 'Jin Kim', 'Tetsushi Sakuma', 'Takashi Yamamoto', 'Jae-Hak Park']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Roles for Nkx3.1 in prostate development and cancer.', 'Toll-like receptor 4 (Tlr4) knockout rats produced by transcriptional activator-like effector nuclease (TALEN)-mediated gene inactivation.', 'Functional analysis of NKX3.1 in LNCaP prostate cancer cells by RNA interference.', 'Integrating differentiation and cancer: the Nkx3.1 homeobox gene in prostate organogenesis and carcinogenesis.', 'Roles of the Nkx3.1 homeobox gene in prostate organogenesis and carcinogenesis.', 'CRISPR/Cas9: implication for modeling and therapy of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.', 'Gene expression of male pathway genes sox9 and amh during early sex differentiation in a reptile departs from the classical amniote model.', 'Constitutive and conditional gene knockout mice for the study of intervertebral disc degeneration: Current status, decision considerations, and future possibilities.', 'Recent Advances in the Production of Genome-Edited Rats.']"""

To establish a new therapeutic target for CRPC, we investigated an association of the system with CRPC progression and evasion from the antitumor immune responses.  Methods:   C5aR and PD-L1 were immunostained in the prostate cancer (PC) tissues. The relationship of PC C5aR expression to clinicopathological parameters was analyzed. CRPC cell lines were examined for C5aR expression by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, immunoblotting, and flow cytometry. C5a effects were examined on CRPC cell glutamine consumption, proliferation, invasion, and PD-L1 expression.  Results:   PC cells expressed C5aR in 83 of the 161 patients (52%) and in three of the six CRPC patients. Basal cells, but not luminal cells, of noncancerous prostate glands expressed C5aR. Three CRPC cell lines expressed C5aR. C5a increased CRPC cell glutamine consumption 2.1-fold, proliferation 1.3-1.6-fold, and invasion 2-3-fold in a C5a-concentration and a C5aR-dependent manner. High expression of C5aR did not relate to the PC patients' clinical parameters but the PD-L1-positive rate was higher in the C5aR high-expression patients (37.5%) compared to low- or no expression patients (17.8%), and double-positive PC cells were present. C5a increased CRPC cell PD-L1 production 1.4-fold and cell-surface expression 2.6-fold.  Conclusions:   C5aR expression of PC cells in patients' tissues and C5a augmentation of C5aR-dependent CRPC proliferation, invasion, and PD-L1 expression suggested participation of the C5a-C5aR system in CRPC promotion and evasion from antitumor immune responses.

Here, a label-free fluorescence aptasensing strategy for detecting PSA based on hybridization chain reaction (HCR) and G-quadruplex DNAzymes has been developed. This designed strategy consists of three DNA probes, aptamer probe (AP), hairpin probe 1 (H1) and hairpin probe 2 (H2). In the presence of target PSA, the aptamer sequences in AP specifically recognized PSA to form a PSA-aptamer complex, causing an AP conformation change and thus releasing the initiator, which triggered the chain-like assembly of H1 and H2 that yielded extended nicked double-stranded DNA through HCR. Upon the addition of hemin, the G-rich segments at the end of H1 and H2 self-assembled into the peroxidase-mimicking hemin/G-quadruplex DNAzymes, which catalyzed the hydrogen peroxide-mediated oxidation of thiamine to give a fluorescence signal dependent on the concentration of PSA. Under optimal conditions, a limit of detection of 0.05 nM and a linear range from 0.1 nM to 1 nM (R2 = 0.9942) were achieved by this assay. In addition, other interfering proteins, such as IgG, AFP and CEA, did not produce any significant change in the fluorescence intensity response, indicating good selectivity of this sensor for PSA detection.

Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are nano-scale vesicles released by most mammalian cells. EVs are promising biomarker source for PCa liquid biopsy due to its minimal invasive approach, rich information and improved accuracy compared to the clinical standard prostate-specific antigen (PSA). However, current EV separation methods cannot separate pure EVs and the quality characteristics from these methods remain largely unknown. In this study, we evaluated the quality characteristics of human plasma-derived EVs by comparing three clinical suitable separation kits.  Methods:   We combined EV separation by commercial kits with magnetic beads capture and flow cytometry analysis, and compared three kits including ExoQuick Ultra based on precipitation and qEV35 and qEV70 based on size exclusion chromatography (SEC).  Results:   Our results indicated that two SEC kits provided higher EV purity and lower protein contamination compared to ExoQuick Ultra precipitation and that qEV35 demonstrated a higher EV yield but lower EV purity compared to qEV70. Particle number correlated very well particularly with CD9/81/63 positive EVs for all three kits, which confirms that particle number can be used as the estimate for EV amount. At last, we found that several EV metrics including total EVs and PSA-specific EVs could not differentiate PCa patients from health controls.  Conclusion:   We provided a systematic workflow for the comparison of three separation kits as well as a general analysis process in clinical laboratories for EV-based cancer diagnosis. Better EV-associated cancer biomarkers need to be explored in the future study with a larger cohort.""","""['Bairen Pang', 'Ying Zhu', 'Jie Ni', 'Juanfang Ruan', 'James Thompson', 'David Malouf', 'Joseph Bucci', 'Peter Graham', 'Yong Li']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Int J Nanomedicine""","""['Extracellular vesicles: the next generation of biomarkers for liquid biopsy-based prostate cancer diagnosis.', 'Immunoaffinity based methods are superior to kits for purification of prostate derived extracellular vesicles from plasma samples.', 'Comprehensive evaluation of methods for small extracellular vesicles separation from human plasma, urine and cell culture medium.', 'Impact of Extracellular Vesicle Isolation Methods on Downstream Mirna Analysis in Semen: A Comparative Study.', 'Extracellular vesicles for liquid biopsy in prostate cancer: where are we and where are we headed?', 'Recent Advances in Blood-Based Liquid Biopsy Approaches in Prostate Cancer.', 'Differences in Circulating Extracellular Vesicle and Soluble Cytokines in Older Versus Younger Breast Cancer Patients With Distinct Symptom Profiles.', 'Tumor-derived extracellular vesicles as messengers of natural products in cancer treatment.', 'Tumor-Specific miRNA Signatures in Combination with CA19-9 for Liquid Biopsy-Based Detection of PDAC.', 'Characterization of Extracellular Vesicles from Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid and Plasma of Patients with Lung Lesions Using Fluorescence Nanoparticle Tracking Analysis.']"""

In this study, we investigated NETO2 expression in breast, prostate, and colorectal cancer using quantitative PCR (qPCR), as well as the effect of shRNA-mediated NETO2 silencing on transcriptome changes in colorectal cancer cells. In the investigated tumors, we observed both increased and decreased NETO2 mRNA levels, presenting no correlation with the main clinicopathological characteristics. In HCT116 cells, NETO2 knockdown resulted in the differential expression of 17 genes and 2 long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), associated with the upregulation of circadian rhythm and downregulation of several cancer-associated pathways, including Wnt, transforming growth factor (TGF)-β, Janus kinase (JAK)-signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT), mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (AKT) pathways. Furthermore, we demonstrated the possibility to utilize a novel model organism, short-lived fish Nothobranchius furzeri, for evaluating NETO2 functions.

These plans were delivered to Delta4 Phantom+ MR and film phantoms passing the clinical quality assurance criteria used in our clinic. In addition, we also performed some initial MR imaging experiments during dynamic therapy, demonstrating that the impact of radiation and moving gantry/collimator components on the image quality is negligible.

Progress in MR imaging has allowed us to better visualise prostate cancer and thus perform targeted biopsies of tumour suspect lesions. mpMRI-ultrasound fusion-guided prostate biopsy is a precise and cost-effective method to diagnose prostate cancer. Objective: The purpose of this study was to summarise our results in mpMRI-ultrasound fusion biopsy between 2017 and 2019 and compare them with the findings in the current literature. Method: Between 2017 and 2019, fully 40, mpMRI-ultrasound fusion biopsies were performed transperineally using the BioJet fusion system at Semmelweis University Urology Clinic. The MRI evaluations were done in line with the PI-RADS v2 guidelines. It was analysed whether the PI-RADS score, the location of the tumour, lesion size, the signs of extraprostatic extension, PSA/PSAD density and prostate volume have an influence on the outcome of mpMRI-ultrasound fusion biopsy. Results: Prostate cancer was diagnosed in 80% of the cases during targeted biopsies. The detection rate was 91%, 85%, and 20% for PI-RADS 5, 4 and 3 lesions, respectively. The detection rate was significantly higher for lesions located at the peripheral zone compared to the ones in the transitional zone (khi2(1) = 6.555, p = 0.010, Fisher-exact p = 0.017, V = 0.355). Signs of extraprostatic extension and higher PSAD correlated with better detection rate (khi2(1)= 7.704, p = 0.006, Fisher-exact p = 0.004, V = 0.355; and 0.47 ± 0.50 ng/ml2 vs. 0.18 ± 0.17 ng/ml2; Z = 3.447, p<0.001, respectively). The size of the lesions did not influence the outcome. The analysis showed a significant correlation between large prostate volumes and negative biopsies (50.9 ± 18.8 ml vs. 119.6 ± 91.6 ml; Z= –3.505, p<0.001). Conclusions: The detection rate of prostate cancer with targeted biopsies was higher than the data found in the international literature. The PI-RADS score, the location of the tumour, MRI signs of extraprostatic extension, PSAD and prostate volume had an influence on the detection rate.

Recently, we have demonstrated that GLO1 is overexpressed in human malignant melanoma cells and patient tumors and substantiated a novel role of GLO1 as a molecular determinant of invasion and metastasis in melanoma. Here, employing NanoString™ gene expression profiling (nCounter™ 'PanCancer Progression Panel'), we report that CRISPR/Cas 9-based GLO1 deletion from human A375 malignant melanoma cells alters glucose metabolism and redox homeostasis, observable together with acceleration of tumorigenesis. Nanostring™ analysis identified TXNIP (encoding thioredoxin-interacting protein), a master regulator of cellular energy metabolism and redox homeostasis, displaying the most pronounced expression change in response to GLO1 elimination, confirmed by RT-qPCR and immunoblot analysis. TXNIP was also upregulated in CRISPR/Cas9-engineered DU145 prostate carcinoma cells lacking GLO1, and treatment with MG or a pharmacological GLO1 inhibitor (TLSC702) mimicked GLO1_KO status, suggesting that GLO1 controls TXNIP expression through regulation of MG. GLO1_KO status was characterized by (i) altered oxidative stress response gene expression, (ii) attenuation of glucose uptake and metabolism with downregulation of gene expression (GLUT1, GFAT1, GFAT2, LDHA) and depletion of related key metabolites (glucose-6-phosphate, UDP-N-acetylglucosamine), and (iii) immune checkpoint modulation (PDL1). While confirming our earlier finding that GLO1 deletion limits invasion and metastasis with modulation of EMT-related genes (e.g. TGFBI, MMP9, ANGPTL4, TLR4, SERPINF1), we observed that GLO1_KO melanoma cells displayed a shortened population doubling time, cell cycle alteration with increased M-phase population, and enhanced anchorage-independent growth, a phenotype supported by expression analysis (CXCL8, CD24, IL1A, CDKN1A). Concordantly, an accelerated growth rate of GLO1_KO tumors, accompanied by TXNIP overexpression and metabolic reprogramming, was observable in a SCID mouse melanoma xenograft model, demonstrating that A375 melanoma tumor growth and metastasis can be dysregulated in opposing ways as a consequence of GLO1 elimination.""","""['Jana Jandova', 'Georg T Wondrak']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Redox Biol""","""['Genetic Target Modulation Employing CRISPR/Cas9 Identifies Glyoxalase 1 as a Novel Molecular Determinant of Invasion and Metastasis in A375 Human Malignant Melanoma Cells In Vitro and In Vivo.', 'GLO1 overexpression in human malignant melanoma.', 'Integrated genomic and functional analyses reveal glyoxalase I as a novel metabolic oncogene in human gastric cancer.', 'Emerging Glycation-Based Therapeutics-Glyoxalase 1 Inducers and Glyoxalase 1 Inhibitors.', 'Multiple roles of glyoxalase 1-mediated suppression of methylglyoxal glycation in cancer biology-Involvement in tumour suppression, tumour growth, multidrug resistance and target for chemotherapy.', 'Cardio-oncology: Shared Genetic, Metabolic, and Pharmacologic Mechanism.', 'Redox Signaling Modulates Activity of Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors in Cancer Patients.', 'Systemic deuteration of SCID mice using the water-isotopologue deuterium oxide (D2 O) inhibits tumor growth in an orthotopic bioluminescent model of human pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.', 'Small extracellular vesicles in metabolic remodeling of tumor cells: Cargos and translational application.', 'H3K27 acetylation activated long noncoding RNA RP11-162G10.5 promotes breast cancer progression via the YBX1/GLO1 axis.']"""

Methods:   Patients who underwent RARP between June 2011 and May 2016 were invited to participate through mailed questionnaires. A total of 207 patients formed our cohort. The questionnaires included European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life of Cancer patients 30 and PR25 modules, sexual health inventory in men and Likert decisional regret scale. A Decisional Regret Scale score of >15 was used to define an outcome of high decision regret.  Results:   The mean patient age was 63 years and the mean duration of follow up was 36 months.

AR-V7 expression levels in stage T4 patients significantly increased. NF-Kβ and HSP-27 protein levels were significantly higher in Met-PCa patients.  Discussion:   Our findings highlight the targeting of the proteostasis and inflammation pathways through inhibiting HSP-27 and NF-Kβ. This might be a valuable strategy to overcome anti-androgen resistance and improve drug therapy in Met-PCa patients whose gene expression levels of AR-V7 and AR-V567es variants are high.""","""['Ilker Kiliccioglu', 'Cenk Y Bilen', 'Sinan Sozen', 'Ece Konac']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Gene""","""['Melatonin Inhibits Androgen Receptor Splice Variant-7 (AR-V7)-Induced Nuclear Factor-Kappa B (NF-κB) Activation and NF-κB Activator-Induced AR-V7 Expression in Prostate Cancer Cells: Potential Implications for the Use of Melatonin in Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer (CRPC) Therapy.', 'Expression of AR-V7 and ARv567es in Circulating Tumor Cells Correlates with Outcomes to Taxane Therapy in Men with Metastatic Prostate Cancer Treated in TAXYNERGY.', 'Differential regulation of metabolic pathways by androgen receptor (AR) and its constitutively active splice variant, AR-V7, in prostate cancer cells.', 'Molecular Origin, Expression Regulation, and Biological Function of Androgen Receptor Splicing Variant 7 in Prostate Cancer.', 'Role of androgen receptor splice variants, their clinical relevance and treatment options.', 'LOX-1 Activation by oxLDL Induces AR and AR-V7 Expression via NF-κB and STAT3 Signaling Pathways Reducing Enzalutamide Cytotoxic Effects.', 'AR and PI3K/AKT in Prostate Cancer: A Tale of Two Interconnected Pathways.', 'Inhibiting androgen receptor splice variants with cysteine-selective irreversible covalent inhibitors to treat prostate cancer.', 'Advances in the Current Understanding of the Mechanisms Governing the Acquisition of Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.']"""

National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) criteria help distinguish between those groups. We studied and attempted to improve this stratification.  Patients and methods:   A total of 4048 (NCCN favorable: 2015 [49.8%] vs. unfavorable 2033 [50.2%]) patients with IR PCa treated with radical prostatectomy were abstracted from an institutional database (2000-2018). Multivariable logistic regression models predicting upstaging and/or upgrading (Gleason Grade Group [GGG] IV-V and/or ≥ pT3 or pN1) in IR PCa were developed, validated, and directly compared with the NCCN IR PCa stratification.  Results:   All 4048 patients were randomly divided between development (n = 2024; 50.0%) and validation cohorts (n = 2024; 50.0%). The development cohort was used to fit basic (age, prostate-specific antigen, clinical T stage, biopsy GGG, and percentage of positive cores [all P < .001]) and extended models (age, prostate-specific antigen, clinical T stage, biopsy GGG, prostate volume, and percentage of tumor within all biopsy cores [all P < .001]). In the validation cohort, the basic and the extended models were, respectively, 71.4% and 74.7% accurate in predicting upstaging and/or upgrading versus 66.8% for the NCCN IR PCa stratification. Both models outperformed NCCN IR PCa stratification in calibration and decision curve analyses (DCA). Use of NCCN IR PCa stratification would have misclassified 20.1% of patients with ≥ pT3 or pN1 and/or GGG IV to V versus 18.3% and 16.4% who were misclassified using the basic or the extended model, respectively.  Conclusion:   Both newly developed and validated models better discriminate upstaging and/or upgrading risk than the NCCN IR PCa stratification.""","""['Lara Franziska Stolzenbach', 'Luigi Nocera', 'Claudia Collà-Ruvolo', 'Zhe Tian', 'Sophie Knipper', 'Tobias Maurer', 'Derya Tilki', 'Markus Graefen', 'Pierre I Karakiewicz']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Clin Genitourin Cancer""","""['Improving the stratification of intermediate risk prostate cancer.', 'The impact of race/ethnicity on upstaging and/or upgrading rates among intermediate risk prostate cancer patients treated with radical prostatectomy.', 'Adverse upgrading and/or upstaging in contemporary low-risk prostate cancer patients.', 'Identifying intermediate-risk candidates for active surveillance of prostate cancer.', 'Variability in Outcomes for Patients with Intermediate-risk Prostate Cancer (Gleason Score 7, International Society of Urological Pathology Gleason Group 2-3) and Implications for Risk Stratification: A Systematic Review.', 'Integrative deep learning analysis improves colon adenocarcinoma patient stratification at risk for mortality.', 'Incidence and Predicting Factors of Histopathological Features at Robot-Assisted Radical Prostatectomy in the mpMRI Era: Results of a Single Tertiary Referral Center.', 'Differences in rates of pelvic lymph node dissection in National Comprehensive Cancer Network favorable, unfavorable intermediate- and high-risk prostate cancer across United States SEER registries.', 'Predicting the probability of pT3 or higher pathological stage at radical prostatectomy: COVID19-specific considerations.', 'Endogenous testosterone density predicts unfavorable disease at final pathology in intermediate risk prostate cancer.']"""

Objective:   To test the effectiveness of cefpodoxime as oral antibiotic prophylaxis for transrectal prostate biopsies and the complication rates relative to fluoroquinolones.  Design, setting, and participants:   Antibiotic prophylaxis for transrectal prostate biopsies at the Department of Urology at University Hospital Frankfurt was fluoroquinolones for 342 consecutive patients in January 2018 and December 2019 and cefpodoxime for 100 patients from January 2020 to July 2020. Data were prospectively evaluated and retrospectively analyzed. Patients were followed up according to clinical routine at 6 wk after biopsy at the earliest. Patients without follow-up (n = 98) and those receiving antibiotic prophylaxis other than cefpodoxime or fluoroquinolones (n = 15) were excluded.  Intervention:   Use of cefpodoxime or fluoroquinolones as antibiotic prophylaxis for transrectal prostate biopsies.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Logistic regression models were used to predict biopsy-related complications according to antibiotic prophylaxis.  Results and limitations:   Of 442 patients, 100 (22.6%) received cefpodoxime as antibiotic prophylaxis. Patient baseline and biopsy characteristics were comparable between the cefpodoxime and fluoroquinolone groups. Moreover, there were no differences in the number of prior prostate biopsies or the proportions of systematic vs. fusion biopsies (p > 0.05). There were no differences between the groups in infectious complications such as epididymitis and prostatitis after biopsy. Infectious complication rates were very low, at 2.0% in the cefpodoxime and0.9%fluoroquinolone group. Moreover, there were no differences between the groups in patient-reported complications, such as gross hematuria occurring at more than 5 d after biopsy, hematospermia, or rectal bleeding. In multivariable analyses, after adjustment for patient and prostate biopsy characteristics, cefpodoxime was not associated with higher complication rates than fluoroquinolones (p > 0.05).  Conclusions:   Complications after transrectal prostate biopsies are rare and cefpodoxime might be a sufficient choice as oral antibiotic prophylaxis and noninferior compared to fluoroquinolones.

New surgical techniques to improve these functions after the operation are under evaluation for example, preservation of endopelvic fascia during RALP. However, the benefits of this technique have not been critically scrutinized in a randomized setting.  Aim:   In this study, we compared endopelvic fascia preserving operation with the standard surgical procedure in a randomized trial at the Tampere University Hospital, Finland.  Methods:   A total of 158 men with localized prostate cancer and scheduled for RALP were randomized 1:1 into endopelvic fascia-preserving RALP or a control group that is, standard operation. All operations were performed by a single surgeon.  Outcomes:   Urinary and sexual function were evaluated by the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite-26 questionnaire at baseline and 3, 6, and 12 months after the surgery.  Results:   There was no difference in urinary incontinence or sexual function between the groups at any time point (urinary incontinence domain at 12 months after RALP for fascia preserving and control group 73.6 ± 3 vs 78.9 ± 2.5 and sexual domain 43 ± 3.2 vs 40.3 ± 3, respectively). Clinical and pathologic tumor characteristics, duration of surgery, blood loss, rate of complications, and time to hospital discharge were similar between the study arms. Compliance of filling out the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite-26 questionnaire varied from 91% to 98%, with no difference between study arms.  Clinical implications:   Based on our results, endopelvic fascia preservation alone during RALP is not recommended over the standard surgical method.  Strengths & limitations:   This is a randomized clinical study with sufficient statistical power. As a limitation, only a minority of participants underwent magnetic resonance imaging before the operation, thus we could not evaluate the role of urethral length or shape of the prostate. Urinary and sexual function results are based on questionnaires filled out by the patients, however, participants completed the surveys independently unassisted by health care personnel.  Conclusion:   Endopelvic fascia-preserving RALP does not improve urinary continence or sexual function as compared with the standard surgical technique. Future studies aiming to improve functional outcomes after RALP should focus on evaluating other technique modifications. Siltari A, Riikonen J, Murtola TJ.

However, the comparative performance of the SP robot in relation to earlier models such as the da Vinci Xi is still unclear.  Objective:   To compare intraoperative and short-term postoperative outcomes between the da Vinci Xi and SP robots for patients undergoing radical prostatectomy (RP) in a referral center.  Design, setting, and participants:   Data were prospectively collected for patients undergoing RP from June 2019 to April 2020 in a single center. The da Vinci SP was used for 71 patients and the da Vinci Xi for 875 patients. After propensity score (PS) matching, two groups of 71 patients were selected for the comparative study.  Intervention:   RP via a transperitoneal approach using the same technique steps and anatomy access with both robot consoles.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   A PS analysis was performed using the covariates age, body mass index, Charlson comorbidity index, Sexual Health Inventory for Men score, American Urological Association symptom score, prostate size, prostate-specific antigen levels, Gleason score, D'Amico risk group, and degree of nerve-sparing. Intraoperative performance and short-term functional (continence and potency) and oncological outcomes were compared between the groups.  Results and limitations:   Median follow-up was 4.4 mo (interquartile range [IQR] 1.6-7.2) for the SP group and 3.2 mo (IQR 1.6-4.8) for the Xi group (p = 0.2). The median total operative time and median console time were both significantly higher in the SP group, with median differences of 14 min (95% confidence interval [CI] 9-19) and 5 min (95% CI 0-5), respectively. The proportion of patients with blood loss of >100 ml was significantly lower in the SP group (difference of 27%, 95% CI 12-42%). No intra- or postoperative complications were reported in either group. There were no significant differences in pain scores at 6, 12, and 18 h or in positive surgical margin rates between the groups. The SP group had a significantly higher percentage of extraprostatic extension than the Xi group (difference of 16%, 95% CI 4.6-27%). None of the patients experienced biochemical recurrence during follow-up. The difference in continence rates at 45 d between the SP and Xi groups was 11% (95% CI -5.6% to 28%) and the difference in potency rates at 45 d was -7.3% (95% CI -21% to 6.2%). The short-term follow-up for comparison of functional and oncological outcomes is a limitation.  Conclusions:   Despite differences in trocar placement and technology between the two da Vinci consoles, the SP has satisfactory intraoperative performance compared to the Xi. SP surgery can be performed safely and effectively during the initial learning phase. However, longer-term follow-up is needed to provide further evidence on the impact of SP implementation on functional and oncological outcomes.  Patient summary:   We compared intraoperative and short-term postoperative outcomes for patients who underwent radical prostatectomy using two different robots, the da Vinci Xi and the single-port da Vinci SP. We found that operative time was longer for the Single Port console. Studies with long-term follow-up are needed to compare the functional and oncological outcomes.""","""['Marcio Covas Moschovas', 'Seetharam Bhat', 'Marco Sandri', 'Travis Rogers', 'Fikret Onol', 'Elio Mazzone', 'Shannon Roof', 'Alexandre Mottrie', 'Vipul Patel']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Eur Urol""","""['Re: Comparing the Approach to Radical Prostatectomy Using the Multiport da Vinci Xi and Single-port da Vinci SP Robots: A Propensity Score Analysis of Perioperative Outcomes.', 'Comparison between intra- and postoperative outcomes of the da Vinci SP and da Vinci Xi robotic platforms in patients undergoing radical prostatectomy.', 'Technical Modifications Necessary to Implement the da Vinci Single-port Robotic System.', 'Patient surgical satisfaction after da Vinci® single-port and multi-port robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy: propensity score-matched analysis.', 'Standard Multiport vs Single-Port Robot-Assisted Simple Prostatectomy: A Single-Center Initial Experience.', 'Single port robotic radical prostatectomy: a systematic review.', 'Perioperative results of single-port vs multi-port robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy via peritoneal approach: a meta-analysis.', 'Comparison between intra- and postoperative outcomes of the da Vinci SP and da Vinci Xi robotic platforms in patients undergoing radical prostatectomy.', 'Preliminary comparison of the modified extraperitoneal free-PORT single incision technique and transabdominal multi-incision robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy.', 'Implementation and outcomes of Hugo(TM) RAS System in robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy.', 'Intraoperative Ergonomic Assessment of Exoscopes versus Conventional DIEP Flap.']"""

Methods:   The framework involves identifying NCDs to be prioritized, specifying prioritization criteria and determining their weights from a survey of stakeholders. The mean weights from the survey are applied to the NCDs' ratings on the criteria to generate a 'total score' for each NCD, by which the NCDs are prioritized.  Results:   Nineteen NCDs and five criteria were included. The criteria, in decreasing order of importance (mean weights in parentheses), are: deaths across the population (27.7 %), loss of quality-of-life across the population (23.0 %), cost to patients and families (18.6 %), cost to the health system (17.2 %), and whether vulnerable groups are disproportionately affected (13.4 %). The priority list of NCDs, stratified into four tiers of importance, is: 'Very critical' priority: coronary heart disease, back and neck pain, diabetes mellitus; 'Critical' priority: dementia and Alzheimer's disease, stroke; 'High' priority: colon and rectum cancer, depressive disorders, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic kidney disease, breast cancer, prostate cancer, arthritis, lung cancer; and 'Medium' priority: asthma, hearing loss, melanoma skin cancer, addictive disorders, non-melanoma skin cancer, headaches.

The present study used a large number of cases (n = 1,502) based on miRNA chip and miRNA sequencing datasets to evaluate the expression and diagnostic potential of miRNA-222-3p in MPCa. We applied a variety of meta-analytic methods, including forest maps, sensitivity analysis, subgroup analysis and summary receiver operating characteristic curves, to prove the final results. MiRNA-222-3p was reduced in MPCa and had a moderate diagnostic potential in MPCa. We screened 118 miRNA-222-3p targets using three different methods including miRNA-222-3p transfected MPCa cell lines, online prediction databases and differently upregulated genes in MPCa. Moreover, functional enrichment analysis performed to explore the potential molecular mechanism of miRNA-222-3p showed that the potential target genes of miRNA-222-3p were significantly enriched in the p53 signal pathway. In the protein-protein interaction network analysis, SNAP91 was identified as a hub gene that may be closely related to MPCa. Gene chip and RNA sequencing datasets containing 1,237 samples were used to determine the expression level and diagnostic potential of SNAP91 in MPCa. SNAP91 was found to be overexpressed in MPCa and had a moderate diagnostic potential in MPCa. In addition, miRNA-222-3p expression was negatively correlated with SNAP91 expression in MPCa (r = -0.636, P = 0.006). These results demonstrated that miRNA-222-3p might play an important role in MPCa by negatively regulating SNAP91 expression.

Supplement with PEU (2.5 μM, 5 μM, and 10 μM) exhibited a marked inhibitory effect against the growth of DU145 and PC-3 cells, especially beyond 24 h, whereas there is only slight growth inhibitory effect on LNCaP cells at the high concentration of 10 μM at 72 h. This loss of cell viability in DU145 and PC-3 cells by PEU was mediated by the induction of apoptosis via up-regulation of Bax and cleaved-caspase-3, but downregulation of Bcl-2. Moreover, more intracellular ROS and LDH production were observed in DU145 and PC-3 cells upon PEU treatment. Meanwhile, the amount of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β and IL-6) was increased, but the content of anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-10 was attenuated. Additionally, PEU pretreatment resulted in an increase of Keap1 protein expression, and a decline of Nrf2, HO-1 and NQO1 protein expression in DU145 and PC3 cells.

Materials and methods:   Men with metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer were randomized 1:1 to enzalutamide (160 mg/day) plus androgen deprivation therapy or placebo plus androgen deprivation therapy, stratified by disease volume and prior docetaxel treatment. The primary end point was radiographic progression-free survival.

Materials and methods:   Men in this study came from 2 prospective prostate cancer trials of patients undergoing multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic resonance imaging targeted biopsy with genomic profiling of positive biopsy cores. We explored the relationship among tumor grade, magnetic resonance imaging risk and genomic risk for each signature. We evaluated the variability in genomic risk assessment between different biopsy cores and assessed how often magnetic resonance imaging targeted biopsy or the current standard of care (profiling the core with the highest grade) resulted in the highest genomic risk level.  Results:   In all, 224 positive biopsy cores from 78 men with prostate cancer were profiled. For each signature, higher biopsy grade (p <0.001) and magnetic resonance imaging risk level (p <0.001) were associated with higher genomic scores. Genomic scores from different biopsy cores varied with risk categories changing by 21% to 62% depending on which core or signature was used. Magnetic resonance imaging targeted biopsy and profiling the core with the highest grade resulted in the highest genomic risk level in 72% to 84% and 75% to 87% of cases, respectively, depending on the signature used.

However, the use of magnetic resonance imaging and imaging-targeted biopsy for monitoring grade progression has been poorly studied in this population. We aim to define the utility of magnetic resonance imaging-targeted biopsy and systematic biopsy in an active surveillance population.  Materials and methods:   Between July 2007 and January 2020, patients with diagnosed prostate cancer who elected active surveillance were monitored with prostate magnetic resonance imaging, imaging-targeted biopsy and standard systematic biopsy. Patients were eligible for surveillance if diagnosed with any volume Gleason grade 1 disease and select Gleason grade 2 disease. Grade progression (Gleason grade 1 to ≥2 disease and Gleason grade 2 to ≥3 disease) for each biopsy modality was measured at 2 years, 4 years and 6+ years.  Results:   In total, 369 patients had both magnetic resonance imaging-targeted and systematic biopsy and were surveilled for at least 1 year. At 2 years, systematic biopsy, magnetic resonance imaging-targeted biopsy and combined biopsy (systematic+imaging-targeted) detected grade progression in 44 patients (15.9%), 73 patients (26.4%) and 90 patients (32.5%), respectively. Magnetic resonance imaging-targeted biopsy detected more cancer grade progression compared to systematic biopsy in both the low and intermediate risk populations (p <0.001). Of all 90 grade progressions at the 2-year time point 46 (51.1%) were found by magnetic resonance imaging-targeted biopsy alone and missed by systematic biopsy.  Conclusions:   Magnetic resonance imaging-targeted biopsy detected significantly more grade progressions in our active surveillance cohort compared to systematic biopsy at 2 years.

Methods:   Using a randomized controlled study design, we divided 84 advanced PCa patients into an intervention group and a control group, all provided with PCa-related knowledge and answers to their questions, while the former group with FCPS in addition. Before, immediately after and at 1 and 3 months after intervention, we evaluated the effectiveness using the Illness Cognition Questionnaire (ICQ) and Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy － Prostate (FACT-P).  Results:   Totally, 78 of the patients completed the whole intervention procedure, 38 in the intervention and 40 in the control group. There were statistically significant differences between the intervention and control groups in the scores on the three factors of ICQ acceptance (17.89 ± 3.86 vs 15.20 ± 2.83, t = 3.528, P < 0.05), perceived benefits (18.68 ± 3.02 vs 17.08 ± 2.74, t = 2.465, P < 0.05) and helplessness (13.37 ± 3.00 vs 15.63 ± 3.11, t = －3.259, P < 0.05) immediately after intervention, and so were there at 1 and 3 months after intervention (P < 0.05). The patients in the intervention group showed remarkably higher quality of life scores than the controls immediately after (100.59 ± 11.66 vs 92.20 ± 9.54, t = 7.943, P < 0.05) and at 1 month (93.03 ± 13.33 vs83.55 ± 14.29, t = 3.481, P < 0.05) and 3 months after intervention (85.66 ± 17.39 vs 75.95 ± 16.66, t = 3.025, P < 0.05). The covariance analysis found that, excluding the time effect, FCPS significantly improved the positive illness cognition of the patients (P < 0.05).  Conclusions:   Family-centered psychological support contributes to the positive illness cognition of the patients with advanced PCa and helps improve their quality of life, and therefore deserves to be popularized in clinical practice.""","""['Jing Han', 'Dong-Liang Yang', 'Ji-Hai Liu', 'Bing-Heng Li', 'Yi Kan', 'Sai Ma', 'Li-Jun Mao']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Zhonghua Nan Ke Xue""","""['Efficacy of a Brief, Peer-Delivered Self-management Intervention for Patients With Rare Chronic Diseases: A Randomized Clinical Trial.', 'Psychosocial interventions for men with prostate cancer.', 'Quality of life among patients with advanced prostate cancer: a survey using functional assessment of cancer therapy-prostate in China.', 'Illness cognitions in later life: Development and validation of the Extended Illness Cognition Questionnaire (ICQ-Plus).', 'Psychosocial interventions for men with prostate cancer: a Cochrane systematic review.', 'Application of single-point prostate biopsy in elderly patients with highly suspected prostate cancer.']"""
