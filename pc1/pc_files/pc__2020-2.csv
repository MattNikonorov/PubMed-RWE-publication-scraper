Factors ranging from genetics to neighborhood environment contribute to these disparities. However, unlike genetics, agnostic investigations that identify candidate variables from large-scale data, and that allow for empiric investigations into differential associations between neighborhood and PCa by race/ethnicity, to the authors' knowledge have not been well explored. Thus, herein, the authors built on their previously developed, empiric neighborhood-wide association study (NWAS) in white men and conducted a NWAS in black men to determine whether findings differed by race.  Methods:   Pennsylvania Cancer Registry data were linked to US Census data. For the NWAS in non-Hispanic black men, the authors evaluated the association between 14,663 neighborhood census variables and advanced PCa (11 high-stage and/or high-grade cases and 8632 low-stage and/or low-grade cases), adjusting for age, diagnosis year, spatial correlation, and multiple testing. Odds ratios and 95% credible intervals were reported. Replication of NWAS findings across black and white races was assessed using Bayesian mixed effects models.  Results:   Five variables related to housing (3 variables), education (1 variable), and employment and/or transportation (1 variable) were found to be significantly associated with advanced PCa in black men compared with 17 socioeconomic variables (mostly related to poverty and/or income) in white men. The top hit in black men was related to crowding in renter-occupied housing (odds ratio, 1.10; 95% credible interval, 1.001-1.12). Nine of 22 NWAS hits (4 of 5 hits in black men) were replicated across racial/ethnic groups.  Conclusions:   Different neighborhood variables, or ""candidates,"" were identified across race-specific NWASs. These findings and empiric approaches warrant additional study and may inform PCa racial disparities, particularly future gene-environment studies aimed at identifying patients and/or communities at risk of advanced PCa.""","""['Shannon M Lynch', 'Kristen Sorice', 'Erin K Tagai', 'Elizabeth A Handorf']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Cancer""","""['A Neighborhood-Wide Association Study (NWAS): Example of prostate cancer aggressiveness.', 'Trends in mortality among Black and White men with prostate cancer in Massachusetts and Pennsylvania: Race and neighborhood socioeconomic position.', 'The effect of neighborhood social environment on prostate cancer development in black and white men at high risk for prostate cancer.', 'Racial disparities in Black men with prostate cancer: A literature review.', 'Prostate cancer disparities in South Carolina: early detection, special programs, and descriptive epidemiology.', 'Population-Level Patterns of Prostate Cancer Occurrence: Disparities in Virginia.', 'Variation in Cancer Incidence Rates Among Non-Hispanic Black Individuals Disaggregated by Nativity and Birthplace, 2005-2017: A Population-Based Cancer Registry Analysis.', 'Systematic review of neighborhood socioeconomic indices studied across the cancer control continuum.', 'Calling Attention to the Role of Race-Driven Societal Determinants of Health on Aggressive Tumor Biology: A Focus on Black Americans.', 'Effect of Neighborhood and Individual-Level Socioeconomic Factors on Colorectal Cancer Screening Adherence.']"""

In addition, the unclear etiology of PC necessitates further studies into the geographic distribution and age composition of patients with PC. This study was aimed at examining the patterns of the epidemiology of PC to help policymakers to allocate the limited resources of the health care system accordingly.  Methods:   Annual case data and age-standardized rates (ASRs) were obtained for the incidence, mortality, and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) of PC according to age from 1990 to 2017 and for 21 regions, including 195 countries and territories. The estimated annual percentage changes (EAPCs) of ASRs were calculated to evaluate the incidence and mortality trends of PC.  Results:   Worldwide, the age-standardized incidence rate (ASIR) of PC increased from 30.5 cases per 100,000 population in 1990 to 37.9 cases per 100,000 population in 2017 with an EAPC of 0.59 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.49-0.7), whereas the mortality decreased with an EAPC of -0.73 (95% CI, -0.80 to -0.67). The ASIR was positively associated with the sociodemographic index (SDI) in most regions, and the increase in the ASIR was steeper with a higher SDI. The proportion of patients younger than 65 years increased from 23.6% in 1990 to 27.3% in 2017.  Conclusions:   The incidence of PC has been increasing globally, whereas its mortality and DALYs have been decreasing. These trends are particularly significant in developed regions and vary across geographic regions.

Thus, HOXC4 and HOXC6 are clinically relevant biomarkers of aggressive prostate cancer. However, the molecular mechanisms by which these HOXC genes contribute to prostate cancer is not yet understood. To begin to address the role of HOXC4 and HOXC6 in prostate cancer, we performed RNA-seq analyses before and after siRNA-mediated knockdown of HOXC4 and/or HOXC6 and also performed ChIP-seq to identify genomic binding sites for both of these transcription factors. Our studies demonstrate that HOXC4 and HOXC6 co-localize with HOXB13, FOXA1 and AR, three transcription factors previously shown to contribute to the development of prostate cancer. We suggest that the aberrantly upregulated HOXC4 and HOXC6 proteins may compete with HOXB13 for binding sites, thus altering the prostate transcriptome.

The PLCOm2012 (Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian) Cancer Screening Trial 6-year and PanCan (Pan-Canadian Early Detection of Lung Cancer) nodule malignancy risk models are two of the better validated risk prediction models for screenee selection and nodule management, respectively. Combined use of these models for participant selection and nodule management could significantly improve screening efficiency.Objectives: The ILST (International Lung Screening Trial) is a prospective cohort study with two primary aims: 1) Compare the accuracy of the PLCOm2012 model against U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) criteria for detecting lung cancers and 2) evaluate nodule management efficiency using the PanCan nodule probability calculator-based protocol versus Lung-RADS.Methods: ILST will recruit 4,500 participants who meet USPSTF and/or PLCOm2012 risk ≥1.51%/6-year selection criteria. Participants will undergo baseline and 2-year low-dose computed tomography screening. Baseline nodules are managed according to PanCan probability score. Participants will be followed up for a minimum of 5 years. Primary outcomes for aim 1 are the proportion of individuals selected for screening, proportion of lung cancers detected, and positive predictive values of either selection criteria, and outcomes for aim 2 include comparing distributions of individuals and the proportion of lung cancers in each of three management groups: next surveillance scan, early recall scan, or diagnostic evaluation recommended. Statistical powers to detect differences in the four components of primary study aims were ≥82%.Conclusions: ILST will prospectively evaluate the comparative accuracy and effectiveness of two promising multivariable risk models for screenee selection and nodule management in lung cancer screening.Clinical trial registered with www.clinicaltrials.gov (NCT02871856).""","""['Kuan Pin Lim', 'Henry Marshall', 'Martin Tammemägi', 'Fraser Brims', 'Annette McWilliams', 'Emily Stone', 'Renee Manser', 'Karen Canfell', 'Marianne Weber', 'Luke Connelly', 'Rayleen V Bowman', 'Ian A Yang', 'Paul Fogarty', 'John Mayo', 'John Yee', 'Renelle Myers', 'Sukhinder Atkar-Khattra', 'David C L Lam', 'Antoni Rosell', 'Christine D Berg', 'Kwun M Fong', 'Stephen Lam;ILST (International Lung Screening Trial) Investigator Consortium']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Ann Am Thorac Soc""","""['Participant selection for lung cancer screening by risk modelling (the Pan-Canadian Early Detection of Lung Cancer PanCan study): a single-arm, prospective study.', 'USPSTF2013 versus PLCOm2012 lung cancer screening eligibility criteria (International Lung Screening Trial): interim analysis of a prospective cohort study.', 'Evaluation of Prediction Models for Identifying Malignancy in Pulmonary Nodules Detected via Low-Dose Computed Tomography.', 'Application of risk prediction models to lung cancer screening: a review.', 'Selecting lung cancer screenees using risk prediction models-where do we go from here.', 'Challenges and outlook in the management of pulmonary nodules detected on CT.', 'Invitation methods for Indigenous New Zealand Māori in lung cancer screening: Protocol for a pragmatic cluster randomized controlled trial.', 'A diagnostic classification of lung nodules using multiple-scale residual network.', 'Evaluation of the accuracy of the PLCOm2012 6-year lung cancer risk prediction model among smokers in the CARTaGENE population-based cohort.', '""What do I think about implementing lung cancer screening?

Therefore, PSMA has emerged as a very attractive target for developing radiopharmaceuticals for the diagnosis, e.g., by positron emission tomography (PET) imaging, and radiotherapy of prostate cancer. The aim of this study was to develop 18F-labeled PSMA ligands bearing different 18F-glycosyl moieties to study the effect on the in vivo clearance behavior of radiotracers in addition to their tumor binding ability. Therefore, we applied click chemistry-based 18F-fluoroglcosylation using 2-deoxy-2-[18F]fluoroglucosyl azide or 6-deoxy-6-[18F]fluoroglucosyl azide as prosthetic groups for the radiosynthesis of the 18F-fluoroglycosylated glutamate-urea-lysine-based PSMA inhibitors 2-[18F]FGlc-PSMA ([18F]7) and 6-[18F]FGlc-PSMA ([18F]8). The PSMA inhibitory potencies were determined by competitive radioligand binding assays using 99mTc-MIP-1404 and PSMA-expressing PC-3 PIP cells, revealing moderate PSMA inhibitory potencies for [18F]7 (IC50 = 234 nM) and [18F]8 (IC50 = 59 nM). Biodistribution and small-animal PET studies were performed using PSMA-positive PC-3 PIP and PSMA-negative PC-3 tumor-bearing nude mice. PSMA inhibitors [18F]7 and [18F]8 were obtained in high radioactivity yields of 19-22% (nondecay-corrected, referred to [18F]fluoride) and with molar activities of 71-136 GBq/μmol. In the biodistribution studies, the uptake levels of [18F]7 and [18F]8 in PC-3 PIP tumors were 13 ± 3%ID/g and 6 ± 5%ID/g at 60 min p.i., respectively. PSMA-negative PC-3 tumors and all other tissues had negligible low uptake values. Interestingly, [18F]7 had high uptake in the kidneys, with remarkable retention from 30 to 60 min p.i. (74 to 72%ID/g). In contrast, [18F]8 revealed a low uptake of 7.5%ID/g in the kidneys at 30 min p.i. and was rapidly cleared through the kidney (0.9%ID/g at 120 min p.i.). In direct comparison to a 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET scan of the same mouse, [18F]7 and [18F]8 showed 2- to 3-fold higher uptake values in PC-3 PIP tumors. Both radiotracers were solely cleared via the kidneys and not via the hepatobiliary pathway. The regional kidney distribution pattern of the tracers in the kidneys revealed that 68Ga-PSMA-11 and 2-[18F]FGlc-PSMA([18F]7) mainly accumulated in the cortex of the kidneys, whereas 6-[18F]FGlc-PSMA([18F]8) showed a 10-fold lower kidney uptake with accumulation in the inner medulla or pelvis of the kidneys. Overall, the developed 6-fluoroglucosyl derivative [18F]8, with its considerably low kidney uptake and fast clearance, demonstrated high uptake in PSMA-positive tumors in vivo.

Results:   Support networks for couples became smaller as time progressed. Stigma was seen to have a role in men's disclosure decisions. Partners generally provided higher levels of support than they received back. By Time 3, men who had previously attended social support groups rejoined to seek informational and emotional support. For partners, there appeared to be a fine line between disclosing their true feelings and protecting their partner, and they appeared to struggle to access meaningful emotional support and accept instrumental support from trusted others.

However, the role of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in its effect on prostate cancer is not well-known. We examined cell proliferation, colony formation, migration, ROS production, and the expression of antioxidant-related genes after treatment of human prostate cancer PC3 and DU145 cells with pimozide. In addition, histopathology, ROS production, and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity were analyzed after administering pimozide to TRAMP, a transgenic mouse with prostate cancer. Pimozide increased the generation of ROS in both cell lines and inhibited cell proliferation, migration, and colony formation. Oxidative stress induced by pimozide caused changes in the expression of antioxidant enzymes (SOD1, peroxiredoxin 6, and glutathione peroxidase 2) and CISD2. Co-treatment with glutathione, an antioxidant, reduced pimozide-induced ROS levels, and counteracted the inhibition of cell proliferation. Administration of pimozide to TRAMP mice reduced the progression of prostate cancer with increased ROS generation and decreased SOD activity. These results suggest that the antipsychotic drug, pimozide, has beneficial effects in prostate cancer in vivo and in vitro. The mechanism of pimozide may be related to augmenting ROS generation.

Although androgen deprivation therapy for advanced PCa patients has significantly improved their survival, the majority of these patients eventually develop castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Proscillaridin A (Pro A), a cardiac glycoside that is clinically used to treat various heart failure diseases, has been reported to have anticancer activity in several cancers. However, whether Pro A exerts an inhibitory effect on PCa progression remains unknown. In this study, we determined possible antitumor effects of Pro A on PCa cells and demonstrated the following: firstly, Pro A selectively inhibited androgen-independent PCa (including PC3 and DU145) cell growth and induced cell apoptosis in vitro; secondly, Pro A significantly decreased cell motility and invasion of androgen-independent PCa cells; thirdly, Pro A enhanced the sensitivity of PCa cells to docetaxel; fourthly, Pro A significantly inhibited the growth of PCa xenografts in vivo and patient-derived organoids (PDO). In addition, RNA-sequencing analysis revealed that the antitumor effects of Pro A on androgen-independent PCa appeared to be achieved via driving the activation of endoplasmic reticulum stress. The antitumor effects of Pro A could be ameliorated by reactive oxygen species scavenger and ER stress inhibitors.

Thirty-two patients undergoing volumetric modulated arc therapy for prostate cancer were evaluated for a 3D displacement error between bone- and prostate-matching spatial coordinates using multiple acquisition planning CT (MPCT) scans. Each MPCT image and a past CT image were used to perform rigid image registration (RIR) and deformable image registration (DIR), and the 3D displacement error was calculated. Correlations of the 3D displacement error in each MPCT scan and between the MPCT and past CT were evaluated based on RIR and DIR, respectively. The 3D displacement error in the MPCT images exhibited moderate correlation with the 3D displacement error between MPCT and past CT for both RIR (adjusted r2 = 0.495) and DIR (adjusted r2 = 0.398). In the correlation analysis between MPCT and past CT, image pairs with 3D displacement errors ≥ 6 mm were significantly different from those with errors < 6 mm (p < 0.0001). Past CT images were different from the planning CT images, which can be attributed to setup tools, flat-top plates, and physical differences due to the presence or absence of urine as well as prescription effects. The relationship between bone and prostate exhibited small deviations between the planning and past CT regardless of pretreatment. The prostate, which only has a slight effect on the displacement between it and bladder volume, was covered with a stiff pelvic bone. As a result, MPCT images exhibited correlations with past CT images of various difference states such as body positions. Finally, large 3D displacement errors in prostate position were caused by pelvic tension and stress, which can be detected using diagnosed past CT images instead of requiring MPCT scans. By comparing past and planning CT images, the random displacement error in the planning CT scan can be avoided by evaluating 3D displacement errors. The new method using the past CT images can estimate the displacement error of the prostate during the treatment period with 1 plan CT scan only, and it helps improve the treatment accuracy.""","""['Yoshinori Tanabe', 'Takayuki Ishida', 'Hidetoshi Eto', 'Tatsuhiro Sera', 'Yuki Emoto']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Med Dosim""","""['Evaluation of the correlation between prostatic displacement and rectal deformation using the Dice similarity coefficient of the rectum.', 'Patient-specific radiotherapy quality assurance for estimating actual treatment dose.', 'Geometric discrepancy of image-guided radiation therapy in patients with prostate cancer without implanted fiducial markers using a commercial pseudo-CT generation method.', 'Usefulness of hybrid deformable image registration algorithms in prostate radiation therapy.', 'Multi-atlas-based auto-segmentation for prostatic urethra using novel prediction of deformable image registration accuracy.']"""

Results:   In 7 patients (20.5%), uptake was not significant on BS and Ga-68 PSMA PET / CT images, which is related to metastasis. In 14 (41%) patients, bone metastases were observed in both examinations. However, more metastatic lesions were observed in the Ga-68 PSMA PET/CT of 3 patients and in the bone scintigraphy of 2 patients. PSMA expression was not observed on Ga-68 PSMA PET / CT in 13 (38%) patients with increased activity in bone scintigraphy. Two (6%) of these patients were thought to be metastatic, 2 (6%) were suspicious for metastasis, and 9 (26%) had no metastasis. When a lesion-based evaluation was performed, a total of 480 activities were evaluated: increased activity uptake was found in 305 BS, and 427 PSMA expression activity was detected. Furthermore, 435 of these activities were evaluated as metastatic.  Conclusion:   Ga-68 PSMA PET/CT provides an additional contribution to the BS evaluation of activity areas because of the presence of PSMA expression and anatomical lesions. In 6% of the patients, activity on BS and metastatic appearance in CT images were observed and the presence of lesions in the absence of PSMA was determined. This suggests that bone metastases without PSMA expression may also be present.""","""['Emine Acar', 'Recep Bekiş', 'Berna Polack']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Curr Med Imaging Rev""","""['More advantages in detecting bone and soft tissue metastases from prostate cancer using 18F-PSMA PET/CT.', 'Comparison of Ga-68 PSMA positron emission tomography/computerized tomography with Tc-99m MDP bone scan in prostate cancer patients.', 'Comparison of bone scintigraphy and 68Ga-PSMA PET for skeletal staging in prostate cancer.', 'Head-To-Head Comparison of 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT and 99mTc-MDP Bone Scintigraphy for the Detection of Bone Metastases in Patients With Prostate Cancer: A Meta-Analysis.', 'Gallium-68 Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen PET Imaging.', 'Systematic review & meta-analysis of positron emission tomography/computed tomography and bone scan in the diagnosis of prostate lesions.', 'Incorporating PSMA-Targeting Theranostics Into Personalized Prostate Cancer Treatment: a Multidisciplinary Perspective.']"""

The presence of residual adenocarcinoma or positive surgical margins provides useful prognostic information and can influence ongoing adjuvant therapy. Although uncommon, mimics of treated adenocarcinoma may be present in the surgical specimen. A high index of suspicion is critical in avoiding potential false-positive pitfalls, and the exclusion of mimics of treated adenocarcinoma is paramount to accurate diagnosis and treatment. Seminal vesicle epithelium has long been a challenge in differentiating prostatic adenocarcinoma from benign epithelium. However, the role of incidental seminal vesiculectomy in rectal resections due to fibrous adhesion to the rectal wall secondary to chemoradiation has not been studied. As the seminal vesicle epithelium can show markedly atypical nuclei with radiation-type effect at baseline, the potential risk of misinterpretation as residual adenocarcinoma is high.

Material and methods:   Twenty-three patients were enrolled in this study. For DKI model and MEM, the Dapp, Kapp, and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) were obtained by using single-shot echo-planar imaging sequence. The pathologies were confirmed by in-bore magnetic resonance (MR)-guided biopsy. Regions of interest (ROI) were drawn manually in the position where biopsy needle was put. The mean values and histogram parameters in cancer and noncancerous foci were compared using independent-samples T test. Receiver operating characteristic curves were used to investigate the diagnostic efficiency. Spearman's test was used to evaluate the correlation of parameters and Gleason scores.  Results:   The mean, 10th, 25th, 50th, 75th, and 90th percentiles of ADC and Dapp were significantly lower in prostate cancer than non-cancerous foci (P < 0.001).

In the present study, we intended to elucidate the antitumor efficacy of proxalutamide through the metabolomic profiling of PCa cells. Two AR-positive PCa cell lines and two AR-negative PCa cell lines were investigated. Cell viability assays based on ATP quantitation were conducted. LC-Q/TOF-MS was used to analyze intracellular metabolites before or after the administration of proxalutamide and two other clinical AR antagonists (bicalutamide and enzalutamide). The results of this study showed that the inhibitory effect of proxalutamide on PCa cell proliferation was better than that of bicalutamide and enzalutamide, and proxalutamide preferentially affected AR-positive PCa cells over AR-negative cells. The metabolic composition of PCa cells changed significantly after proxalutamide administration, and these changes in response to proxalutamide were significantly different from those in the presence of the two other AR antagonists. In AR-positive cells, proxalutamide significantly decreased the intracellular levels of glutamine, glutamate, glutathione, cysteine, glycine, aspartate, uridine, cytidine and thymidine. However, the effects of the two other antagonists on these discriminant metabolites were ambiguous, and no changes in these metabolites were found in AR-negative cells.

More recent studies highlighted the enzyme's role in the backdoor pathway leading to androgen production. Increased CYP17A1 activity in endocrine disorders and diseases are associated with elevated C21 and C19 steroids which include 17α-hydroxyprogesterone and androgens, as well as C11-oxy C21 and C11-oxy C19 steroids. We previously reported that 11β-hydroxyprogesterone (11OHP4), 21-deoxycortisol (21dF) and their keto derivatives are converted by 5α-reductases and hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases yielding C19 steroids in the backdoor pathway. In this study the 17α-hydroxylase and 17,20-lyase activity of CYP17A1 towards the unconventional C11-oxy C21 steroid substrates and their 5α- and 3α,5α-reduced metabolites was investigated in transfected HEK-293 cells. CYP17A1 catalysed the 17α-hydroxylation of 11OHP4 to 21dF and 11-ketoprogesterone (11KP4) to 21-deoxycortisone (21dE) with negligible hydroxylation of their 5α-reduced metabolites while no lyase activity was detected. The 3α,5α-reduced C11-oxy C21 steroids-5α-pregnan-3α,11β-diol-20-one (3,11diOH-DHP4) and 5α-pregnan-3α-ol-11,20-dione (alfaxalone) were rapidly hydroxylated to 5α-pregnan-3α,11β,17α-triol-20-one (11OH-Pdiol) and 5α-pregnan-3α,17α-diol-11,20-dione (11K-Pdiol), with the lyase activity subsequently catalysing to conversion to the C11-oxy C19 steroids, 11β-hydroxyandrosterone and 11-ketoandrosterone, respectively. Docking of 11OHP4, 11KP4 and the 5α-reduced metabolites, 5α-pregnan-11β-ol-3,20-dione (11OH-DHP4) and 5α-pregnan-3,11,20-trione (11K-DHP4) with human CYP17A1 showed minimal changes in the orientation of these C11-oxy C21 steroids in the active pocket when compared with the binding of progesterone suggesting the 17,20-lyase is impaired by the C11-hydroxyl and keto moieties. The structurally similar 3,11diOH-DHP4 and alfaxalone showed a greater distance between C17 and the heme group compared to the natural substrate, 17α-hydroxypregnenolone potentially allowing more orientational freedom and facilitating the conversion of the C11-oxy C21 to C11-oxy C19 steroids. In summary, our in vitro assays showed that while CYP17A1 readily hydroxylated 11OHP4 and 11KP4, the enzyme was unable to catalyse the 17,20-lyase reaction of these C11-oxy C21 steroid products. Although CYP17A1 exhibited no catalytic activity towards the 5α-reduced intermediates, once the C4-C5 double bond and the keto group at C3 were reduced, both the hydroxylation and lyase reactions proceeded efficiently. These findings show that the C11-oxy C21 steroids could potentially contribute to the androgen pool in tissue expressing steroidogenic enzymes in the backdoor pathway.""","""['Desmaré van Rooyen', 'Rahul Yadav', 'Emily E Scott', 'Amanda C Swart']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""J Steroid Biochem Mol Biol""","""['The in vitro metabolism of 11β-hydroxyprogesterone and 11-ketoprogesterone to 11-ketodihydrotestosterone in the backdoor pathway.', '11α-Hydroxyprogesterone, a potent 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase inhibitor, is metabolised by steroid-5α-reductase and cytochrome P450 17α-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase to produce C11α-derivatives of 21-deoxycortisol and 11-hydroxyandrostenedione in vitro.', 'Adrenal C11-oxy C21 steroids contribute to the C11-oxy C19 steroid pool via the backdoor pathway in the biosynthesis and metabolism of 21-deoxycortisol and 21-deoxycortisone.', 'Assessment of steroidogenesis and steroidogenic enzyme functions.', 'Back where it belongs: 11β-hydroxyandrostenedione compels the re-assessment of C11-oxy androgens in steroidogenesis.', 'The role of 11-oxygenated androgens in prostate cancer.', 'Sex Hormones and Lung Inflammation.', 'Characterization of human adrenal cytochrome P450 11B2 products of progesterone and androstenedione oxidation.']"""

Considering the benefits recently described regarding the application of low-intensity extracorporeal shockwave therapy (LiESWT) in vasculogenic ED, questions arise about its role in the scenario of penile rehabilitation.  Aim:   To compare the early introduction of phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor (PDE5i) with a combination therapy enrolling both early PDE5i use and LiESWT in patients submitted to RP.  Methods:   This study is a randomized clinical trial, open-label, with 2 parallel arms and an allocation ratio of 1:1. The study was registered in ReBEC (ensaiosclinicos.gov.br) Trial: RBR-85HGCG. Both arms started tadalafil at a dose of 5 mg/day right after the removal of the transurethral catheter, and the experimental group received 2,400 shocks/session-week distributed on 4 different penile regions. The full treatment consisted of 19,200 impulses across 8 weeks.  Outcomes:   The primary clincal end point was ≥4-point difference favoring the experimental group considering the mean International Index of Erectile Function short form (IIEF-5) at last follow-up. Any statistical difference in the IIEF-5 score between the arms was stated as the primary statistical end point.  Results:   Between September 25, 2017, and December 3, 2018, 92 men were enrolled in the study. At last follow-up, we assessed 77 patients, 41 in the control group and 36 in the intervention group. A difference between groups was detected when accessing the final median IIEF-5 score (12.0 vs 10.0; P = .006). However, the primary clinical endpoint considering a difference ≥4-point between the arms has not been reached. When performing an exploratory analysis comparing the proportion of those individuals with an IIEF-5 score ≥17, no difference between groups was noted (17.1% vs 22.2%; P = .57).  Clinical implications:   So far, the benefits arising from LiESWT for penile rehabilitation after RP have been uncertain.  Strengths & limitations:   This is the first trial assessing the role of LiESWT on erectile function after RP. Our study protocol included only one session per week for the experimental group, raising a query if a more intensive application could achieve better results once a statistically significant difference was found between groups. We discontinue the PDE5i use at the last session, which may have interfered in the penile vascular rehabilitation, maybe compromising the results too.  Conclusion:   After therapy with 19,200 impulses therapy across 8 weeks, we found an improvement of the IIEF-5 score, but it was not enough to be considered clinically significant.

Focal treatment reduces this risk while offering a second opportunity for cure. We report updated outcomes of ultrafocal salvage high-dose-rate brachytherapy (HDR-BT).  Methods and materials:   Prospectively collected data from the first 50 treated patients were analyzed. Disease status was assessed by 3T multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), 18F-Choline or 68Ga-prostate-specific membrane antigen positron emission tomography/computed tomography, and systematic or tumor-targeted biopsies. Ultrafocal salvage HDR-BT (1 × 19 Gy) was performed by implanting the clinical target volume (CTV: gross tumor volume + 5 mm margin) under fused transrectal ultrasound/MRI guidance. Follow-up included toxicity grading (using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events 4.0), quality of life assessment, and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing.  Results:   Median follow-up was 31 months. Median CTV D95% was 18.8 Gy. We observed 2% grade 3 genitourinary toxicity, no grade 3 gastrointestinal toxicity, and 22% newly developed grade 3 erectile dysfunction. Five of 13 patients (38%) with self-reported pretreatment potency (International Index of Erectile Function >17) remained potent. Clinically relevant quality of life deterioration was reported for only 6 of 31 items and was not statistically significant. Biochemical failure (nadir + 2) occurred in 26 patients. Among intraprostatic recurrences, 73% were in field. After 2.5 years, biochemical disease-free survival was 51% (95% confidence interval, 37%-69%), metastases-free survival was 75% (64%-89%), androgen deprivation therapy-free survival was 90% (82%-99%), and overall survival was 98% (94%-100%). Presalvage PSA, CTV size, and stage ≥T3 were significantly associated with biochemical failure. Higher-risk patients (stage ≥T3, PSA ≥10, or PSA double time ≤9 months) had 25% biochemical disease-free survival at 2.5 years versus 71% for lower-risk patients.

Observational studies have reported conflicting findings, but such studies are susceptible to confounding and reverse causation. Understanding the potential role of allergy in carcinogenesis may shed new light on the biological mechanisms underpinning intrinsic immunity and cancer.  Methods:   We conducted a Mendelian randomization study, using germline genetic variants as instrumental variables, to determine the causal relevance of allergic disease and on two most common malignancies: breast cancer and prostate cancer. We used the summary statistics from the largest ever genome-wide association studies conducted on allergic disease (ncase = 180,129), asthma (ncase = 14,085), breast (ncase = 122,977), and prostate cancer (ncase = 79,148) and calculated odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of cancer for allergic disease.  Results:   We did not observe any evidence to support a causal association between allergic disease and risk of breast cancer overall [OR 1.00 (95% CI 0.96-1.04), p = 0.95] or by subtype (estrogen receptor (ER)+ [0.99 (0.95-1.04), p = 0.71], ER- [1.05 (0.99-1.10), p = 0.11]). We also did not find any evidence for an association with prostate cancer [1.00 (0.94-1.05), p = 0.93] or advanced subtype [0.97 (0.90-1.05), p = 0.46]. Sensitivity analyses did not reveal directional pleiotropy.  Conclusion:   Our study does not support a causal effect of allergic disease on the risk of breast or prostate cancer.

A multivariable logistic regression model was produced to assess the predictors of positive 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT results. The performance characteristics of the model were assessed by quantifying the predictive accuracy, according to model calibration. Yuden's index was used to find the best nomogram's cut-off. Finally, decision curve analysis (DCA) was implemented to quantify the nomogram's clinical value.  Results:   In the external cohort, the overall detection rate of 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT was 44% vs. 64.7% in the original population. At multivariate analysis, PSA at 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT (OR: 7.06, p < 0.001) and ongoing ADT at time of 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT (OR: 2.07, p = 0.03) were the only independent predictors of PET/CT positivity. The predictive accuracy of nomogram was suboptimal and comparable to that reported in the original model (64% vs. 67%, respectively). The calibration plot indicated suboptimal concordance.

Objective:   We investigated the anti-cancer effects and mechanism of action of EPA on PC3 prostate cancer cells in vitro.  Methods:   PC3 cells were treated with various concentrations of EPA, and cell survival and the abilities of migration and invasion were evaluated. The time course of the growth inhibitory effect of EPA on PC3 cells was also assessed. The mechanism underlying the anti-cancer effects of EPA was investigated by human phosphokinase and human apoptosis antibody arrays, and confirmed by western blot analysis. We also examined the contribution of reactive oxygen species (ROS) to the effects of EPA using the ROS inhibitor N-acetyl cysteine.  Results:   EPA decreased the survival of PC3 cells in a dose-dependent manner within 3 h of application, with an effective concentration of 500 μmol/L. EPA inhibited proline-rich tyrosine kinase (Pyk)2 and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 phosphorylation as determined by western blotting and the antibody arrays. The growth of PC3 cells was inhibited by EPA, which was dependent on ROS induction, while EPA inhibited Pyk2 phosphorylation independent of ROS production.

Since many men with prostate cancer are retired, work ability represents a more relevant work measure than employment status. The primary aim was to examine the prevalence of men who had high versus moderate/poor current work ability compared to their lifetime best work ability at a mean of 3.0 years after robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy. The secondary aim was to study variables associated with moderate/poor work ability at survey.  Methods:   This is a questionnaire-based study of men who had robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy at Oslo University Hospital, Radiumhospitalet between January 2005 and August 2010. Among them 777 responded (79%), 730 reported on current work ability, socio-demographic data, somatic and mental health, and typical adverse effects (the EPIC-26) after prostatectomy. High versus moderate/poor work ability was the primary outcome. Descriptive statistics and logistic regression analyses were applied.  Results:   The mean age of the sample at survey was 65.5 years (SD 5.9). At survey 42% of the sample reported moderate/poor current work ability and 58% reported high work ability. In multivariable analysis older age at survey, low basic education, comorbidity, poor self-rated health, presence of depression and low EPIC-26 hormonal domain score remained significantly associated with moderate/poor work ability.  Conclusions:   Current work ability is a useful measure for the working capacity particularly of retired men. Socio-demographic, cancer-related, health, psychological and typical adverse effect variables were significantly associated with moderate/poor current work ability after robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy, and several health and psychological variables are amenable to identification and treatment by health care providers.""","""['Alv A Dahl', 'Bjørn Brennhovd', 'Sophie D Fosså', 'Karol Axcrona']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""BMC Urol""","""['The EPIC-26 domain scores after radical prostatectomy are associated with the personality trait of neuroticism.', 'Robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy versus open radical retropubic prostatectomy: early outcomes from a randomised controlled phase 3 study.', 'Robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy versus open radical retropubic prostatectomy: 24-month outcomes from a randomised controlled study.', 'Robotic Surgical System for Radical Prostatectomy: A Health Technology Assessment.', 'Prostate Cancer Nonascitic Peritoneal Carcinomatosis After Robot-assisted Laparoscopic Radical Prostatectomy: 3 Case Reports and Review of the Literature.', 'The Relation of Work Ability and Return to Work Among Iranian Cancer Survivors.', 'Work-life balance predicted work ability two years later: a cohort study of employees in the Swedish energy and water sector.', 'Prostate Cancer Treatment and Work: A Scoping Review.']"""

Methods:   The thickness and the level of diffusion restriction was assessed qualitatively and quantitatively in 406 sympathetic ganglia (189 CTG in 101 males and 217 CG in 116 males) on DWI maps (b-value 0 and 800 s/mm2) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps (mean ADC) of the whole-body PET/MR 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/MR. To form a reference group of a matching ganglia size, the smallest lymph node was chosen from each patient with metastases and underwent the same procedure.  Results:   Very low and low level of diffusion restriction was noted in the majority of sympathetic ganglia (81.0 % CTG, 67.3 % CG, and 73.6 % of all). In the majority (91.7 %) of metastatic lymph nodes the level of diffusion restriction was moderate to high.The mean ADC values in sympathetic ganglia were statistically significantly higher in CTG, CG and all ganglia than in metastatic lymph nodes (p < 0.001; the effect size was large).

Methods and materials:   This dose-response study comprises 673 patients (57%) of the 1180 per-protocol patients included in the HYPO-RT-PC trial (median follow-up 5, years), where patients were randomized to CF (39 × 2.0 Gy, 8 weeks) or UHF (7 × 6.1 Gy, 2.5 weeks). No androgen deprivation therapy was allowed. Only patients with erectile function sufficient for intercourse at baseline and complete RT data were included in this study. Erectile function was assessed by physician at regular follow-ups. The main endpoint was severe ED (EDs). The penile bulb (PB) and crus were retrospectively delineated on the treatment planning computed tomography scans. Dose-volume descriptors were derived from EQD2 converted dose matrices (α/β = 3 Gy). Univariable and multivariable Cox proportional hazard regression and logistic regression were used to find predictors for EDS.  Results:   No significant difference in EDs was found between CF and UHF. During the follow-up period, EDs occurred in 27% of the patients in both treatment groups. Average (median) PB mean dose, Dmean, was 24.5 (20.2) in CF and 18.7 (13.1) Gy3 in UHF. Age was the only significant predictor for EDs in Cox analyses. All dose-volume variables contributed significantly in univariable logistic regression at 2-year follow-up. Age and near maximum dose (D2%) were significant predictors for EDs in multivariable logistic regression analyses at both 1 and 2 years.  Conclusions:   The frequency of EDS was similar in the CF and UHF treatment groups. Age at radiation therapy was the strongest predictor for EDs, followed by dose to PB, and was most evident for younger patients.

In addition to traditional QTLs by association, allele-specific (AS) QTLs are a powerful measure of cis-regulation that are concordant with traditional QTLs but typically less susceptible to technical/environmental noise. However, existing methods for estimating causal variant probabilities (i.e., fine mapping) cannot produce valid estimates from asQTL signals due to complexities in linkage disequilibrium (LD). We introduce PLASMA (Population Allele-Specific Mapping), a fine-mapping method that integrates QTL and asQTL information to improve accuracy. In simulations, PLASMA accurately prioritizes causal variants over a wide range of genetic architectures. Applied to RNA-seq data from 524 kidney tumor samples, PLASMA achieves a greater power at 50 samples than conventional QTL-based fine mapping at 500 samples, with more than 17% of loci fine mapped to within five causal variants, compared to 2% by QTL-based fine mapping, and a 6.9-fold overall reduction in median credible set size compared to QTL-based fine mapping when applied to H3K27AC ChIP-seq from just 28 prostate tumor/normal samples. Variants in the PLASMA credible sets for RNA-seq and ChIP-seq were enriched for open chromatin and chromatin looping, respectively, at a comparable or greater degree than credible variants from existing methods while containing far fewer markers.

Although recent studies have qualitatively suggested neutrons as a cause of malfunction, numerical understanding has not been reached. The purpose of this work is to quantitatively clarify the contribution of secondary neutrons from out-of-field irradiation to the malfunction of CIEDs as well as to deduce the frequency of malfunctions until completion of prostate cancer treatment as a typical case.  Materials and methods:   Measured data were gathered from the literature and were re-analyzed. Firstly, linear relationship for a number of malfunctions to the neutron dose was suggested by theoretical consideration. Secondly, the accumulated number of malfunctions of CIEDs gathered from the literature was compared with the prescribed dose, scattered photon dose, and secondary neutron dose for analysis of their correlation. Thirdly, the number of malfunctions during a course of prostate treatment with high-energy X-ray, passive proton, and passive carbon-ion beams was calculated while assuming the same response to malfunctions, where X-rays consisted of 6-MV, 10-MV, 15-MV, and 18-MV beams. Monte Carlo simulation assuming simple geometry was performed for the distribution of neutron dose from X-ray beams, where normalization factors were applied to the distribution so as to reproduce the empirical values.  Results:   Linearity between risk and neutron dose was clearly found from the measured data, as suggested by theoretical consideration. The predicted number of malfunctions until treatment completion was 0, 0.02 ± 0.01, 0.30 ± 0.08, 0.65 ± 0.17, 0.88 ± 0.50, and 0.14 ± 0.04 when 6-MV, 10-MV, 15-MV, 18-MV, passive proton, and passive carbon-ion beams, respectively, were employed, where the single model response to a malfunction of 8.6 ± 2.1 Sv- 1 was applied.  Conclusions:   Numerical understanding of the malfunction of CIEDs has been attained for the first time. It has been clarified that neutron dose is a good scale for the risk of CIEDs in radiotherapy. Prediction of the frequency of malfunction as well as discussion of the risk to CIEDs in radiotherapy among the multiple modalities have become possible. Because the present study quantitatively clarifies the neutron contribution to malfunction, revision of clinical guidelines is suggested.""","""['Hiroaki Matsubara', 'Takatomo Ezura', 'Yaichiro Hashimoto', 'Kumiko Karasawa', 'Teiji Nishio', 'Masato Tsuneda']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Radiotherapy-Induced Malfunction in Contemporary Cardiovascular Implantable Electronic Devices: Clinical Incidence and Predictors.', 'Effect of X-ray dose rates higher than 8\xa0Gy/min on the functioning of cardiac implantable electronic devices.', 'Malfunctions of implantable cardiac devices in patients receiving proton beam therapy: incidence and predictors.', 'The impact of particle radiotherapy on the functioning of cardiac implantable electronic devices: a systematic review of in vitro and in vivo studies according to PICO criteria.', 'Neutrons from high-energy x-ray medical accelerators: an estimate of risk to the radiotherapy patient.', 'Neutron dose from a 6-MV X-ray beam in radiotherapy.', 'Local dose\xa0rate effects in implantable cardioverter-defibrillators with flattening filter free and flattened photon radiation.', 'In reply to ""Comment on ""Particle therapy using protons or carbon ions for cancer patients with cardiac implantable electronic devices (CIED): a retrospective multi-institutional study"""".', 'Particle therapy using protons or carbon ions for cancer patients with cardiac implantable electronic devices (CIED): a retrospective multi-institutional study.', 'Safety verification of carbon-ion radiotherapy for patients with cardiac implantable electronic devices (CIEDs).']"""

Prostate-associated gene 4 (PAGE4) is an intrinsically disordered protein that is remarkably prostate-specific. PAGE4 is also a stress-response protein that functions as a transcriptional regulator and is upregulated in early-stage prostate cancer (PCa) and its precursor lesions. However, PAGE4 is downregulated in high-grade PCa and metastatic disease. Here, we show that PAGE4 is highly expressed in the stromal cells surrounding the cancer-adjacent ""normal"" glands and low-grade PCa lesions but not in lesions proximal to high-grade PCa. Overexpression of PAGE4 in a stromal cell line inhibits the migration and invasion of PCa epithelial cells in multiple coculture systems. PAGE4 overexpression also inhibits the downregulation of E-cadherin in PCa epithelial cells when cocultured with stromal cells. Furthermore, signaling via tumor necrosis factor-α and transforming growth factor-β pathways is decreased in the stromal cells overexpressing PAGE4 suggesting that PAGE4 appears to play a protective role against disease progression by perturbing interactions between epithelial cells and stromal cells in PCa. Taken together, these findings support previous observations that upregulation of PAGE4 in PCa correlates with a better prognosis and highlight PAGE4 as a novel therapeutic target for early-stage ""low-risk"" disease.""","""['Shui Fu', 'Tao Liu', 'Chengcheng Lv', 'Cheng Fu', 'Ruoheng Zeng', 'Yoshiyuki Kakehi', 'Prakash Kulkarni', 'Robert H Getzenberg', 'Yu Zeng']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""J Cell Biochem""","""['PAGE4 positivity is associated with attenuated AR signaling and predicts patient survival in hormone-naive prostate cancer.', 'PAGE4 promotes prostate cancer cells survive under oxidative stress through modulating MAPK/JNK/ERK pathway.', 'The Stress-response protein prostate-associated gene 4, interacts with c-Jun and potentiates its transactivation.', 'Prostate-associated gene 4 (PAGE4), an intrinsically disordered cancer/testis antigen, is a novel therapeutic target for prostate cancer.', 'Stromal androgen receptor in prostate development and cancer.', 'Single-cell omics traces the heterogeneity of prostate cancer cells and the tumor microenvironment.', 'Chemokines and cytokines: Axis and allies in prostate cancer pathogenesis.']"""

In addition to aging, many factors may contribute to sarcopenia as cancer and/or androgen deprivation therapy (ADT).  Objectives:   The aims of this study are to describe the prevalence of sarcopenia in older prostate cancer patients before initiation of treatment with ADT and radiotherapy, and to evaluate the impact of ADT on the occurrence or aggravation of sarcopenia in this population.  Design:   longitudinal study.  Participants and setting:   Sarcopenia was prospectively evaluated in 31 consecutive patients aged 70 to 88 years, referred in one hospital unit of south eastern France, for a comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA) before cancer treatment initiation.  Measurements and results:   CGA, measures of muscle strength and physical performances were performed at baseline (T0) and at the end of cancer treatment (T1). Appendicular skeletal muscle mass was measured by Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) at the end of treatment. At T0, 8 patients (among 31) had a probable sarcopenia according to European consensus, and 18 had altered physical performance. At T1, 15 patients (among 19) had abnormal one leg balance test. Finally, only one patient had a sarcopenia confirmed by DXA.  Conclusion:   This preliminary study showed a high prevalence of muscle disorders before initiation of ADT in a population of elderly cancer prostate patients with intermediate frailty status, and an increased risk of falls at the end of ADT. This highlighted the importance of screening for sarcopenia before treatment initiation, to prevent the occurrence or aggravation of sarcopenia by possible adjustment of treatment, and implementation of appropriate exercise and nutrition interventions.""","""['A L Couderc', 'X Muracciole', 'E Nouguerede', 'D Rey', 'S Schneider', 'P Champsaur', 'E Lechevallier', 'L Lalys', 'P Villani']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""J Nutr Health Aging""","""['HoSAGE: sarcopenia in older patient with intermediate / high-risk prostate cancer, prevalence and incidence after androgen deprivation therapy: study protocol for a cohort trial.', 'Does Use of Androgen Deprivation Therapy (ADT) in Men with Prostate Cancer Increase the Risk of Sarcopenia?', 'Impact of resistance training on body composition and metabolic syndrome variables during androgen deprivation therapy for prostate cancer: a pilot randomized controlled trial.', 'Does androgen-deprivation therapy accelerate the development of frailty in older men with prostate cancer?: a conceptual review.', 'Exercise can prevent and even reverse adverse effects of androgen suppression treatment in men with prostate cancer.', 'Pre-Therapeutic Sarcopenia among Cancer Patients: An Up-to-Date Meta-Analysis of Prevalence and Predictive Value during Cancer Treatment.', 'High prevalence of vertebral fractures at initiation of androgen deprivation therapy for prostate cancer.', 'HoSAGE: sarcopenia in older patient with intermediate / high-risk prostate cancer, prevalence and incidence after androgen deprivation therapy: study protocol for a cohort trial.', 'Recent advances in de-intensification of radiotherapy in elderly cancer patients.']"""

Patients and methods:   This was a prospective study carried out at Jos University Teaching Hospital. All consecutive patients who had LUTS due to advanced prostate cancer were recruited into the study. All patients completed the international prostate symptom score (IPSS) questionnaire, including QoL assessment. Post-void residual (PVR) urine, maximum flow rate (Qmax), prostate specific antigen and total prostate volume (TPV) were assessed. The parameters before and at 12 months were compared.  Results:   Data from 65 patients were analysed. The mean age of the patients was 68.5 ± 8.67 years with an age range of 46-85 years. Four (6.2%) had mild LUTS before AD, and their symptoms remained mild at 12 months of ADT. Twenty-two (33.9%) patients had moderate urinary symptoms. Of this, 10 (18.5%) patients had symptomatic improvement at 12 months of ADT. Of 39 (60%) patients who presented with severe LUTS, 21 (32.3%) had improvement at 12 months of ADT. Before ADT and at 12 months of ADT, the mean IPSS score, mean TPV, Qmax, PVR and mean QoL score were 23 ± 8.8 and 15 ± 8.8 (P < 0.0001); 79.7 ± 51.4 and 73.4 ± 34.3 (P = 0.212); 8.0 ± 4.7 and 11.2 ± 4.4 (<0.001); 209.8 ± 127.8 and 163 ± 111.4 (<0.001); 4.23 ± 1.2 and 3.24 ± 1.2 (P < 0.001), respectively. Of the 39 patients (60%) with severe urinary symptoms, 18 (27.7%) of patients had urethral catheterization for either acute or chronic urinary retention before ADT. At 12 months on ADT, eight patients (12.3.7%) were still on catheter due to failed attempts at trial without catheter.

We therefore used the National Cancer Institute Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database to assess geographic-specific associations between changes in localized (2008-2011) and later changes in metastatic prostate cancer incidence (2012-2015). We examined trends from 200 health-care service areas (HSAs) within SEER 18 registries. While on average for each HSA, localized incidence decreased by 27.4 and metastatic incidence increased by 2.3 per 100 000 men per year, individual HSA-level changes in localized incidence did not correlate with later changes in metastatic disease.

There are various surgical techniques as well as conservative methods for the treatment of RUF. Nonsurgical approach can be used in nontoxic, minimally symptomatic patients.  Materials & methods:   From 2012 to 2016, 825 patients (mean age 68y) with LPR to be performed were recruited in the study. Postoperatively RUF developed in 7 patients (0.8%) in average in 10 days after surgery. Five cases were uncomplicated presented with pneumaturia, dysuria or urine per rectum. Two patients with fecaluria and previous history of radiotherapy or androgen deprivation were excluded from the study group. Conservative management include: 1)bowel rest 2)broad-spectrum antibiotics after urine culture 3) fully absorbable diet (combination of parenteral and enteral nutrition) 4) bladder drainage (urethral catheter or suprapubic tube). Duration of conservative treatment was 4 weeks. After treatment all patients underwent a voiding cystourethrogram.  Results:   During the treatment one patient has developed severe UTIs and surgical treatment were perfomed. The remaining 4 patients had spontaneous healing of the fistula and normal cystourethrogram. With the median follow up of 24 month after RUF treatment all 4patients had no fistula signs and they were fully continent. Overall RUF closure using nonsurgical treatment was successful in 4 of 5 cases (80%).

Those lesions are frequently located outside the prostate bed, and therefore not cured by the current standards of care like external-beam radiotherapy (EBRT) of the prostatic fossa. This retrospective study analyzes the influence of oligo-metastases' site on outcome after metastasis-directed radiotherapy (MDR).  Methods:   Retrospectively, 359 patients with PET-positive PCa recurrences after RPE were analyzed. Biochemical recurrence-free survival (BRFS) (prostate-specific antigen (PSA) < post-radiotherapy nadir + 0.2 ng/mL) was assessed using Kaplan-Meier survival and Cox regression analysis.  Results:   All patients were initially clinically without distant metastases (cM0). Seventy-five patients had local recurrence within the prostatic fossa, 32 patients had pelvic nodal plus local recurrence, 117 patients had pelvic nodal recurrence, 51 patients had paraaortic lymph node metastases with/without locoregional recurrence, and 84 patients had bone or visceral metastases with/without locoregional recurrence. Median PSA before MDR was 1.2 ng/mL (range, 0.04-47.5). Additive androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) was given in 35% (125/359) of patients. Median PSA nadir after MDR was 0.23 ng/mL (range, < 0.03-18.30). After a median follow-up of 16 months (1-57), 239/351 (68%) patients had no biochemical recurrence. Patients with distant lymph node and/or distant metastases, the so-called oligo-body cohort, had an overall in-field control of 90/98 (91%) but at the same time, an ex-field progress of 44/96 (46%). In comparison, an ex-field progress was detected in 28/154 (18%) patients with local and/or pelvic nodal recurrence (oligo-pelvis group). Compared with the oligo-pelvis group, there was a significantly lower BRFS in oligo-body patients at the last follow-up.  Conclusion:   Overall, BRFS was dependent on patterns of metastatic disease. Thus, MDR of PSMA PET-positive oligo-metastases can be offered considering that about one-third of the patients progressed within a median follow-up of 16 months.""","""['N-S Schmidt-Hegemann', 'S G C Kroeze', 'C Henkenberens', 'M M E Vogel', 'S Kirste', 'J Becker', 'I A Burger', 'T Derlin', 'P Bartenstein', 'M Eiber', 'M Mix', 'Ch la Fougère', 'A C Müller', 'A L Grosu', 'S E Combs', 'H Christiansen', 'M Guckenberger', 'C Belka']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Eur J Nucl Med Mol Imaging""","""['Outcome after PSMA-PET/CT-based salvage radiotherapy for nodal recurrence after radical prostatectomy.', 'Efficacy of PSMA ligand PET-based radiotherapy for recurrent prostate cancer after radical prostatectomy and salvage radiotherapy.', 'PSMA-PET/CT-guided salvage radiotherapy in recurrent or persistent prostate cancer and PSA\u2009<\u20090.2\xa0ng/ml.', 'Use of gallium-68 prostate-specific membrane antigen positron-emission tomography for detecting lymph node metastases in primary and recurrent prostate cancer and location of recurrence after radical prostatectomy: an overview of the current literature.', 'Prostate-specific membrane antigen-positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PSMA-PET/CT)-guided stereotactic ablative body radiotherapy for oligometastatic prostate cancer: a single-institution experience and review of the published literature.', 'Outcome of patients with biochemical recurrence of prostate cancer after PSMA PET/CT-directed radiotherapy or surgery without systemic therapy.', 'Oligometastatic Prostate Cancer: Current Status and Future Challenges.', 'M1a prostate cancer: Results of a Dutch multidisciplinary consensus meeting.', 'The impact of PSMA PET on the treatment and outcomes of men with biochemical recurrence of prostate cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Update to a randomized controlled trial of lutetium-177-PSMA in Oligo-metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer: the BULLSEYE trial.']"""

The current study assessed the value of prostate magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in measuring the radial distance (RD) of EPE and the role of T2 WI signs in predicting the grade of EPE.  Materials and methods:   A total of 110 patients who underwent prostate MRI before radical prostatectomy are enrolled in this retrospective study. Eighty-four patients have organ confined disease and the remaining twenty-six patients have EPE all verified by histopathology. Prostate MRI examinations were conducted with 3T MRI scanner and phased array coil with the following sequences: T2 WI, T1 WI, DCE, DWI with ADC mapping, and high b-value at b = 1500 s/mm2. The likelihood of EPE with 5-point Likert scale was assigned, several MRI features were extracted for each dominant tumor identified by using T2 WI. Tumors with Likert scales 4-5 were evaluated further to obtain MRI-based RD. The relationship between pathological and MRI-determined RD was tested. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression models were developed to detect the grade of pathological EPE. The inputs were among the 2 clinical parameters and 4 MRI features.  Results:   There is a moderate correlation between pathological RD and MRI-determined RD (ρ = 0.45, P < 0.01). In univariate and multivariate models, MRI features and clinical parameters possess varying significance levels (univariate models; P = 0.048-0.788, multivariate models; P = 0.173-0.769). Multivariate models perform better than the univariate models by offering fair to good performances (AUC = 0.69-0.85). The multivariate model that employs the MRI features offers better performance than the model employs clinical parameters (AUC = 0.81 versus 0.69).  Conclusion:   Co-existence of T2 WI signs provide higher diagnostic value even than clinical parameters in predicting the grade of EPE. Combined use of clinical parameters and MRI features deliver slightly superior performance than MRI features alone.""","""['Aslihan Onay', 'Gokhan Ertas', 'Metin Vural', 'Evrim Colak', 'Tarik Esen', 'Baris Bakir']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Abdom Radiol (NY)""","""['Which one is better for predicting extraprostatic extension on multiparametric MRI: ESUR score, Likert scale, tumor contact length, or EPE grade?', 'Evaluation of the most optimal multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging sequence for determining pathological length of capsular contact.', 'Length of capsular contact for diagnosing extraprostatic extension on prostate MRI: Assessment at an optimal threshold.', 'Extraprostatic extension in prostate cancer: primer for radiologists.', 'Multiparametric MRI in detection and staging of prostate cancer.', 'Imaging features of the PI-RADS for predicting extraprostatic extension of prostate cancer: systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Virtual reality tumor navigated robotic radical prostatectomy by using three-dimensional reconstructed multiparametric prostate MRI and 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT images: A useful tool to guide the robotic surgery?']"""

In this study, we performed RNA-seq analysis using 22Rv1 human prostate cancer cell line to identify mechanistic targets of WA. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analysis of the differentially expressed genes showed most significant enrichment of genes associated with metabolism. These results were validated using LNCaP and 22Rv1 human prostate cancer cells and Hi-Myc transgenic mice as models. The intracellular levels of acetyl-CoA, total free fatty acids and neutral lipids were decreased significantly following WA treatment in both cells, which was accompanied by downregulation of mRNA (confirmed by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction) and protein levels of key fatty acid synthesis enzymes, including ATP citrate lyase, acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1, fatty acid synthase and carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1A. Ectopic expression of c-Myc, but not constitutively active Akt, conferred a marked protection against WA-mediated suppression of acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1 and fatty acid synthase protein expression, and clonogenic cell survival. WA was a superior inhibitor of cell proliferation and fatty acid synthesis in comparison with known modulators of fatty acid metabolism including cerulenin and etomoxir. Intraperitoneal WA administration to Hi-Myc transgenic mice (0.1 mg/mouse, three times/week for 5 weeks) also resulted in a significant decrease in circulating levels of total free fatty acids and phospholipids, and expression of ATP citrate lyase, acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1, fatty acid synthase and carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1A proteins in the prostate in vivo.""","""['Su-Hyeong Kim', 'Eun-Ryeong Hahm', 'Krishna B Singh', 'Sruti Shiva', 'Jacob Stewart-Ornstein', 'Shivendra V Singh']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Carcinogenesis""","""['Cytoprotective autophagy induction by withaferin A in prostate cancer cells involves GABARAPL1.', 'Withania somnifera root extract inhibits fatty acid synthesis in prostate cancer cells.', 'Withaferin A Inhibits Fatty Acid Synthesis in Rat Mammary Tumors.', 'Leelamine Is a Novel Lipogenesis Inhibitor in Prostate Cancer Cells In Vitro and In Vivo.', 'Fatty acid metabolism reprogramming in ccRCC: mechanisms and potential targets.', 'Natural Steroidal Lactone Induces G1/S Phase Cell Cycle Arrest and Intrinsic Apoptotic Pathway by Up-Regulating Tumor Suppressive miRNA in Triple-Negative Breast Cancer Cells.', 'Breast Cancer Selective Disruption of Actin Cytoskeleton by Diallyl Trisulfide.', 'The Integration of Metabolomics with Other Omics: Insights into Understanding Prostate Cancer.', 'Gene Expression Changes by Diallyl Trisulfide Administration in Chemically-induced Mammary Tumors in Rats.', 'Paired related homeobox 1 attenuates autophagy via acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1-regulated fatty acid metabolism in salivary adenoid cystic carcinoma.']"""

This study compares historical revenue at Mayo Clinic to the RO-APM and quantifies the effect that disease characteristics may have on reimbursement.  Methods and materials:   FFS Medicare reimbursements were determined for patients undergoing RT at Mayo Clinic from 2015 to 2016. Disease categories and payment episodes were defined as per the RO-APM. Average RT episode reimbursements were reported for each disease site, except for lymphoma and metastases, and stratified by stage and disease subcategory. Comparisons with RO-APM reimbursements were made via descriptive statistics.  Results:   A total of 2098 patients were identified, of whom 1866 (89%) were categorized per the RO-APM; 840 (45%) of those were aged >65 years. Breast (33%), head and neck (HN) (14%), and prostate (11%) cancer were most common. RO-APM base rate reimbursements and sensitivity analysis range were lower than historical reimbursement for bladder (-40%), cervical (-34%), lung (-28%), uterine (-26%), colorectal (-24%), upper gastrointestinal (-24%), HN (-23%), pancreatic (-20%), prostate (-16%), central nervous system (-13%), and anal (-10%) and higher for liver (+24%) and breast (+36%). Historical reimbursement varied with stage (stage III vs stage I) for breast (+57%, P < .01), uterine (+53%, P = .01), lung (+50%, P < .01), HN (+24%, P = .01), and prostate (+13%, P = .01). Overall, for patients older than 65 years of age, the RO-APM resulted in a -9% reduction in total RT reimbursement compared with historical FFS (-2%, -15%, and -27% for high, mid, and low adjusted RO-APM rates).  Conclusions:   Our findings indicate that the RO-APM will result in significant reductions in reimbursement at our center, particularly for cancers more common in underserved populations.

They have also been found to exhibit anti-tumor, anti-angiogenic and anti-proliferative activity. The experimental part of this article describes the effects of BR biosynthetic precursors on prostate cancer cells. The experiments were performed with LNCaP and DU-145 prostate cancer cell lines. These were cultivated and treated with tested BRs in different concentrations and time intervals. The tested compounds were found to affect cell viability, nuclear receptor expression, cell cycle and apoptosis in the tumor cells. IC50 concentrations were determined based on MTT test and the two most active compounds (cathasterone and 6-oxocampestanol) were used in the next experiments. Cathasterone was the most effective of all tested compounds and effectively inhibited integrity of cell spheres. It was found that both BRs had no significant effect on the cell cycle in LNCaP at IC50 concentration, while in DU-145 a significant block in G0/G1 phase after the BR treatment was observed. The effect of BRs on the nuclear steroid receptors was manifested by changes in their expression and localization.

Results:   Breast Cancer Awareness Month led to a significant increase in cancer-specific RSV in October each year during the study period (mean increase 180.1%). In contrast, none of the men's cancer awareness campaigns led to a significant increase in cancer-specific RSV in any year during the study period.

Materials and methods:   Within the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database (2004-2015), 11,429 cases of nonmetastatic stage pT2-T3 urothelial carcinoma of the urinary bladder treated with either PC or radical cystectomy (RC) were identified. All comparisons between PC and RC relied on propensity score (PS; ratio, 1:1) adjusted univariable and multivariable logistic and competing risks regression models. In contrast, all comparisons between PLND and no PLND at PC relied on inverse probability of treatment weighting-adjusted univariable and multivariable Cox regression models.  Results:   Within the SEER database, PC had been performed in 979 patients (8.6%). The PC annual rates decreased from 11.0% to 6.8% during the study period (P < .001).

As rectal gas and rectal volume are known to have a relevant effect on prostate motion, this study aims to reduce these parameters by using a Low FODMAP Diet (LFD) and to show feasibility of this intervention.  Methods:   We compared a prospective intervention group (IG, n = 25) which underwent RT for PCa and whose patients were asked to follow a LFD during RT with a retrospective control group (CG, n = 25) which did not get any dietary advice. In the planning CT scan and all available cone beam CT scans rectal gas was classified based on a semiquantitative score (scale from 1 to 5) and rectal volume was measured. Furthermore, patients' compliance was evaluated by a self-assessment questionnaire.  Results:   Clinical and treatment characteristics were well balanced between both groups. A total of 266 (CG, 10.6 per patient) and 280 CT scans (IG, 11.2 per patient), respectively, were analysed. The frequency distribution of gas scores differed significantly from each other (p < .001) with the IG having lower scores. Rectal volume was smaller in the IG (64.28 cm3, 95% CI 60.92-67.65 cm3, SD 28.64 cm3) than in the CG (71.40 cm3, 95% CI 66.47-76.32 cm3, SD 40.80 cm3) (p = .02). Mean intrapatient standard deviation as a measure for the variability of rectal volume was 22 cm3 in the IG and 23 cm3 in the CG (p = .81). Patients' compliance and contentment were satisfying.  Conclusions:   The use of a LFD significantly decreased rectal gas and rectal volume. LFD was feasible with an excellent patients' compliance. However, prospective trials with a larger number of patients and a standardized evaluation of gastrointestinal toxicity and quality of life are reasonable.

A pilot, phase I study tested the safety and feasibility of a prime-boost immunization regimen based on V935, an adenoviral type 6 vector vaccine expressing a modified version of hTERT, administered alone or in combination with V934, a DNA plasmid that also expresses the same antigen and is delivered using the electroporation injection technique.  Methods:   Treatments: Group #1 received two doses (low-dose: 0.5 × 109 vg, and high-dose: 0.5 × 1011 vg) of V935 followed by a 4-week observation period. Group #2 received three doses of V934-electroporation and two doses of V935 following a 4-week observation period. Doses were low-dose V934 (0.25 mg of plasmid) with low-dose V935 (0.5 × 109 vg); high-dose V934 (2.5 mg of plasmid) with high-dose V935 (0.5 × 1011 vg). Group #3 received five doses of V934-EP and two doses of V935: V934 was administered IM every 2 weeks for five doses. Following a 4-week observation period, V935 was administered IM every 2 weeks for two doses followed by a 4-week observation period. One (1) dose level was tested in treatment group #3: high-dose V934 (2.5 mg of plasmid), in combination with high-dose V935 (0.5 × 1011 vg). Immunogenicity was measured by ELISPOT assay and three pools of peptides encompassing the sequence of hTERT.  Results:   In total, 37 patients affected by solid tumors (prostate cancer in 38%) were enrolled. The safety profile of different regimens was good and comparable across groups, with no severe adverse events, dose-limiting toxicities or treatment discontinuations. As expected, the most common adverse events were local reactions. A significant increase in ELISPOT responses against hTERT peptide pool 2 was observed (p < 0.01), while no evidence of boosting was observed for peptide pools 1 and 3. This was also evident for group #1 and #2 separately. In patients with prostate cancer, there was a significant increase in ELISPOT response against hTERT peptide pool 2 following immunization (p < 0.01), regardless of previous therapy, immunosuppressing agents, or adenoviral type 6 titers at screening.

Cases presentation:   We describe for the first time three cases of CR-TMA due to adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC). All of them had mechanical hemolytic anemia and thrombocytopenia without any other identifiable cause. Bicytopenia was diagnosed either simultaneously with ACC or at the time of metastatic evolution. Two patients had acute kidney injury (AKI) with severe pathological findings on kidney biopsy. Despite total adrenalectomy, chemotherapy, and specific treatment of TMA with plasma-exchanges, renal failure and hemolytic anemia remained. The only manifestation of CR-TMA in the third patient was hemolytic anemia, which resolved after surgical removal of ACC. The evolutions in these patients suggests ACC-related TMA may be related to a circulating factor.  Conclusions:   CR-TMAs are rare.

Hence, there is an urgent need for the development of novel anticancer agents with high usefulness, fewer side effects, devoid of resistance and superior selectivity.  Objective:   The objective of this study is to synthesize a series of novel 1,5-benzothiazepine derivatives and evaluate their anticancer activity employing biological and computational methods.  Methods:   Twenty new benzothiazepines (BT1-BT20) were prepared by condensing different 1-(4- isobutylphenyl)ethanone chalcones with 2-amiothiophenol and evaluated for their anticancer activity by MTT assay against three cell lines including HT-29 (colon cancer), MCF-7 (breast cancer) and DU-145 (prostate cancer). These compounds were also tested for their inhibitory action against EGFR (Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor) tyrosine kinase enzyme by taking into account of their excellent action against colon and breast cancer cell lines. Further, the structural features responsible for the activity were identified by Pharmacophorebased modelling using Schrodinger's PHASETM software.  Results:   Among the 20 benzothiazepine derivatives, three compounds viz., BT18, BT19 and BT20 exhibited promising activity against the cell lines tested and the activity of BT20 was more than the standard methotrexate. Again the above three compounds showed excellent inhibitory activity with the percentage inhibition of 64.5, 57.3 and 55.8 respectively against EGFR (Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor) tyrosine kinase. PHASE identified a five-point AHHRR model for the proposed activity and the computational studies provided insights into the structural requirements for the anticancer activity and the results were consistent with the observed in vitro activity data.

We identified variations in screening by occupation among men in Montreal, Canada (2005-2012).  Methods:   Prostate specific antigen testing and digital rectal examination (ever-screened and frequency of screening, previous five years) were examined among population controls from the Prostate Cancer & Environment Study. Face-to-face interviews elicited lifestyle and occupational histories. Multivariable logistic regression was used to estimate the odds of ever-screening for the longest-held occupation, adjusting for potential confounders. Negative binomial models were used to examine relationships with screening frequency.  Results:   Among 1989 controls, 81% reported ever having had a prostate specific antigen test, and 77% a digital rectal examination. Approximately 40% of men reported having a prostate specific antigen test once a year, on average. Compared with those in management or administrative jobs, men in primary industry (odds ratio 0.26, 95% confidence interval 0.10-0.65), construction (0.44, 0.25-0.79), machining (0.45, 0.21-0.97), and teaching (0.37, 0.20-0.70) were less likely to have undergone prostate specific antigen screening. Results were similar when considering the most recent job.  Conclusions:   Our findings highlight substantial variations in prostate cancer screening by occupation. Men in occupations where carcinogen exposures are more common are less likely to participate in prostate screening activities.

Objectives:   to investigate how well two types of liquid biopsy (urine and blood) capture the prostate cancer methylome, and may thus serve as a non-invasive surrogate for studying the tumor epigenome.  Methods:   A cohort of four metastatic treatment naïve prostate cancer (PCa) patients was selected. Matched biopsy cores (tumor and histologically matched-normal), post-DRE, pre-biopsy urine, and peripheral blood plasma were available for each subject. DNA methylation was profiled utilizing the Infinium® MethylationEPIC BeadChip (Illumina) and analysed using the RnBeads software. Significantly (FDR adjusted P < 0.05) differentially methylated probes (DMPs) between tumor and MN were identified and examined in the liquids (done at a grouped and individual subject level).  Results:   DNA methylation analysis of urine and blood in men with metastatic PCa showed highly correlated patterns between the different liquid types (ρ = 0.93, P < 0.0001), with large contributions from non-tumor sources. DNA methylation profiles of liquids were more similar between subjects, than intra-individual liquid-tumor correlations. Overall, both urine and plasma are viable surrogates for tumor tissue biopsies, capturing up to 39.40% and 64.14% of tumor-specific methylation alterations, respectively.

We modelled treatment planning as a bi-objective optimization problem, in which dose-volume-based planning criteria related to target coverage are explicitly separated from organ-sparing criteria. When this model is optimized, a large set of high-quality plans with different trade-offs can be obtained. This set can be visualized as an insightful patient-specific trade-off curve. In our parameter-tuning approach, the parameters of inverse planning methods are automatically tuned, aimed to maximize the two objectives of the bi-objective planning model. By generating trade-off curves for different inverse planning methods, their maximally achievable plan quality can be insightfully compared. Automatic parameter tuning furthermore allows to construct standard parameter sets (class solutions) representing different trade-offs in a principled way, which can be directly used in current clinical practice. In this work, we considered the inverse planning methods IPSA and HIPO. Thirty-nine previously treated prostate cancer patients were included. We compared automatic parameter tuning, random parameter sampling, and the maximally achievable plan quality obtained by directly optimizing the bi-objective planning model with the state-of-the-art optimization software GOMEA. We showed that for each patient, a set of plans with a wide range of trade-offs could be obtained using automatic parameter tuning for both IPSA and HIPO. By tuning HIPO, better trade-offs were obtained than by tuning IPSA.

Patients and methods:   From January 2012 to January 2015, 20 consecutive cases with lumbar spinal metastases who received single-stage posterior TES were retrospectively analyzed. A visual analog scale (VAS) was used to evaluate patients' pain status, American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) classification was used to evaluate neurological status, and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) score system was used to evaluate patients' performance status at pre- and post-operation and final follow-up. In addition, Intraoperative blood loss, operative time, postoperative complications, local kyphosis angle, and the postoperative duration of hospital stay were analyzed.  Results:   The median follow-up time was 16 months (ranging from 3 to 39 months), and 4 patients were still alive at the last follow-up. The mean amount of intraoperative blood loss and operation time was 970 mL and 232.5 min, respectively. The average VAS score improved from 7.5 preoperative to 2.8 postoperative and 3.2 at the last follow-up. Postoperative complications occurred in 3 cases. Sixteen patients died within 2 years after surgery, 10 of which died within 1 year. In the remaining 4 patients, the mean follow-up period was 37.25 months. One case of local recurrence occurred but no implant failure presented during follow-up.  Conclusions:   Single-stage posterior TES is a challenging but rewarding procedure in the treatment of lumbar spinal metastases. Due to unique anatomy and biomechanics, surgeons should be aware of important vessels, and nerve root injury should be avoided.""","""['Si-Zhen Yang', 'Ying Zhang', 'Wu-Gui Chen', 'Jing Sun', 'Hao Qiu', 'Xiao-Jian Niu', 'Tong-Wei Chu']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Clin Neurol Neurosurg""","""['Total En Bloc Spondylectomy for Solitary Metastatic Tumors of the Fourth Lumbar Spine in a Posterior-Only Approach.', 'Comparison of mini-open anterior corpectomy and posterior total en bloc spondylectomy for solitary metastases of the thoracolumbar spine.', 'Total en bloc spondylectomy of the lower lumbar spine: a surgical techniques of combined posterior-anterior approach.', 'En bloc vertebrectomy for the treatment of spinal lesions.

Methods:   Thirty-five men awaiting prostatectomy volunteered to participate. Participants performed three repetitions of submaximal pelvic floor contraction in sitting and again in standing. Movement of pelvic landmarks with contraction was recorded using an ultrasound imaging transducer placed on the perineum.  Results:   The feasibility of TPUS in men in standing was demonstrated through the visualization of three out of four pelvic landmarks in more than 95% of images in the standing position. Analysis of pelvic landmarks and their respective relationships with muscle shortening demonstrated that the anorectal junction and urethrovesical junction were lower and the estimated length of puborectalis was shorter in standing than sitting. The mid-urethra (striated urethral sphincter) and anorectal junction (puborectalis) landmark displaced further cranially in standing than sitting.  Conclusions:   TPUS can be used to visualize three pelvic landmarks in men with cancerous prostates. Puborectalis is shorter at rest in standing than sitting, and elevation of the mid-urethra and the anorectal junction is more in standing than sitting.

A total of 12 differentially expressed microRNAs (miRNAs) and 102 differentially expressed genes were identified. Five miRNAs had prognostic significance in biochemical recurrence-free survival (miR-636, miR-491-5p, miR-199b-5p, miR-199b-3p, miR-28-3p). The differentially expressed genes were significantly enriched in extracellular matrix, cell-substrate adhesion, collagen and integrin. Seven hub genes (VCAN, COL3A1, COL1A1, APOE, COL1A2, SDC1, THY1) with worse biochemical recurrence-free survival and one hub gene (MMP9) with worse overall survival were detected. miR-636, a novel oncogene, was found to be up-regulated in bone metastatic PCa tissues and also predominately up-regulated in human PCa cell lines. miR-636 promoted cellular invasion and migration, and may promote bone metastasis via targeting MBNL2, TNS1 and STAB1.

Therefore, a fast, standardized, and robust quantitative technique is necessary. Synthetic MRI is capable of quantifying multiple relaxation parameters, which might have potential applications in prostate cancer (PCa).  Purpose:   To investigate the use of quantitative relaxation maps derived from synthetic MRI for the diagnosis and grading of PCa.  Study type:   Prospective.  Subjects:   In all, 94 men with pathologically confirmed PCa or benign pathological changes.  Field strength/sequence:   T1 -weighted imaging, T2 -weighted imaging, diffusion-weighted imaging, and synthetic MRI at 3.0T.  Assessment:   Four kinds of tissue types were identified on pathology, including PCa, stromal hyperplasia (SH), glandular hyperplasia (GH), and noncancerous peripheral zone (PZ). PCa foci were grouped as low-grade (LG, Gleason score ≤6) and intermediate/high-grade (HG, Gleason score ≥7). Regions of interest were manually drawn by two radiologists in consensus on parametric maps according to the pathological results.  Statistical tests:   Independent sample t-test, Mann-Whitney U-test, and receiver operating characteristic curve analysis.  Results:   T1 and T2 values of PCa were significantly lower than SH (P = 0.015 and 0.002). The differences of T1 and T2 values between PCa and noncancerous PZ were also significant (P ≤ 0.006). The area under the curve (AUC) of the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) value was significantly higher than T1 , T2 , and proton density (PD) values in discriminating PCa from SH and noncancerous PZ (P ≤ 0.025). T2 , PD, and ADC values demonstrated similar diagnostic performance in discriminating LG from HG PCa (AUC = 0.806 [0.640-0.918], 0.717 [0.542-0.854], and 0.817 [0.652-0.925], respectively; P ≥ 0.535).  Data conclusion:   Relaxation maps derived from synthetic MRI were helpful for discriminating PCa from other benign pathologies. But the overall diagnostic performance was inferior to the ADC values.

Objectives:   We examine the use of these noninvasive treatment options in the everyday care in a cohort of patients ≥70 years old.  Materials and methods:   In the HAROW study, the treatment of localized PCa under everyday conditions is investigated. The only inclusion criterion was newly diagnosed organ-confined PCa (≤cT2c). In AS, WW, and HT patients, we compared initial tumor and patient characteristics, follow-up examinations and changes of therapy.  Results:   Of 457 patients ≥70 years, 210 chose AS, 160 HT, and 87 WW. Observation times were 6.3 years (AS), 7.5 years (HT), and 7.0 years (WW). AS patients (73.2 years) were younger than WW (76.0 years) and HT patients (76.9 years) and had a higher proportion of low-risk tumors (80%) versus WW (31%) and HT (19%). A change of therapy was observed in 47.1% of AS, 17.2% of WW and 13.1% of HT patients. Metastasis occurred in 1.0% of AS, 4.6% of WW, and 6.9% of HT patients. Overall survival was 94.3% for AS, 90.8% for WW and 81.9% for HT.

LINC00844 expression is dramatically downregulated in prostate cancer, and functional studies have revealed the association between the aberrant expression of LINC00844 and prostate cancer cell invasion and metastasis. However, the function and mechanism of action of LINC00844 in the pathogenesis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are poorly understood.  Methods:   LINC00844 and N-Myc downstream-regulated 1 (NDRG1) expression in HCC tissues and cell lines was detected with real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and western blot analysis. Correlations between LINC00844 expression level and clinicopathological features were investigated using the original data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. HepG2 and HCCLM9 cell lines were transfected with Lv-LIN00844 virus to obtain LINC00844-overexpressing cell lines. Cell proliferation and cell invasion and migration were examined with the cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) and transwell assay, respectively. Furthermore, the correlation between LINC00844 and NDRG1 expression was analysed using Pearson's correlation analysis.  Results:   LINC00844 expression was significantly downregulatedin HCC tissues and cell lines, and a statistical correlation was detected between low LINC00844 expression and sex (Female), advanced American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) stage (III + IV), histological grade (G3 + G4), and vascular invasion (Micro and Macro). In vitro experiments showed that LINC00844 overexpression significantly repressed the proliferation, migration, and invasion of HCC cells.

Early oncogenesis is characterized by mutations in a constrained set of driver genes, and specific copy number gains, such as trisomy 7 in glioblastoma and isochromosome 17q in medulloblastoma. The mutational spectrum changes significantly throughout tumour evolution in 40% of samples. A nearly fourfold diversification of driver genes and increased genomic instability are features of later stages. Copy number alterations often occur in mitotic crises, and lead to simultaneous gains of chromosomal segments. Timing analyses suggest that driver mutations often precede diagnosis by many years, if not decades.

We describe the generation of the PCAWG resource, facilitated by international data sharing using compute clouds. On average, cancer genomes contained 4-5 driver mutations when combining coding and non-coding genomic elements; however, in around 5% of cases no drivers were identified, suggesting that cancer driver discovery is not yet complete. Chromothripsis, in which many clustered structural variants arise in a single catastrophic event, is frequently an early event in tumour evolution; in acral melanoma, for example, these events precede most somatic point mutations and affect several cancer-associated genes simultaneously. Cancers with abnormal telomere maintenance often originate from tissues with low replicative activity and show several mechanisms of preventing telomere attrition to critical levels. Common and rare germline variants affect patterns of somatic mutation, including point mutations, structural variants and somatic retrotransposition. A collection of papers from the PCAWG Consortium describes non-coding mutations that drive cancer beyond those in the TERT promoter4; identifies new signatures of mutational processes that cause base substitutions, small insertions and deletions and structural variation5,6; analyses timings and patterns of tumour evolution7; describes the diverse transcriptional consequences of somatic mutation on splicing, expression levels, fusion genes and promoter activity8,9; and evaluates a range of more-specialized features of cancer genomes8,10-18.""","""['ICGC/TCGA Pan-Cancer Analysis of Whole Genomes Consortium']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Nature""","""['Author Correction: Pan-cancer analysis of whole genomes.', ""Global genomics project unravels cancer's complexity at unprecedented scale."", 'Comprehensive analysis of chromothripsis in 2,658 human cancers using whole-genome sequencing.', 'Patterns of somatic structural variation in human cancer genomes.', 'Analyses of non-coding somatic drivers in 2,658\xa0cancer whole genomes.', 'Decoding human cancer with whole genome sequencing: a review of PCAWG Project studies published in February 2020.', 'Beyond the exome: the role of non-coding somatic mutations in cancer.', 'Electrical detection of RNA cancer biomarkers at the single-molecule level.', 'Identifying functional regulatory mutation blocks by integrating genome sequencing and transcriptome data.', 'Network embedding framework for driver gene discovery by combining functional and structural information.', 'Single-Cell Analysis in the Omics Era: Technologies and Applications in Cancer.', 'HATCHet2: clone- and haplotype-specific copy number inference from bulk tumor sequencing data.']"""

While few non-coding genomic elements are recurrently mutated in this cohort, we identify 93 genes harboring non-coding mutations that cluster into several modules of interacting proteins. Among these are promoter mutations associated with reduced mRNA expression in TP53, TLE4, and TCF4. We find that biological processes had variable proportions of coding and non-coding mutations, with chromatin remodeling and proliferation pathways altered primarily by coding mutations, while developmental pathways, including Wnt and Notch, altered by both coding and non-coding mutations. RNA splicing is primarily altered by non-coding mutations in this cohort, and samples containing non-coding mutations in well-known RNA splicing factors exhibit similar gene expression signatures as samples with coding mutations in these genes.

We established an in vitro mouse PCa model based on organoid technology that takes into account the cell of origin and the order of events. Primary PCa with deletion of the tumor suppressor gene PTEN (PTEN-del) can be modeled through Pten-down-regulation in mouse organoids. We used this system to elucidate the contribution of TIP5 in PCa initiation, a chromatin regulator that is implicated in aggressive PCa. High TIP5 expression correlates with primary PTEN-del PCa and this combination strongly associates with reduced prostate-specific antigen (PSA) recurrence-free survival. TIP5 is critical for the initiation of PCa of luminal origin mediated by Pten-loss whereas it is dispensable once Pten-loss mediated transformation is established. Cross-species analyses revealed a PTEN gene signature that identified a group of aggressive primary PCas characterized by PTEN-del, high-TIP5 expression, and a TIP5-regulated gene expression profile.

Postprogram changes in patients' self-efficacy to manage side effects and side effect bother are also explored. Patients on or anticipating ADT enrolled in the educational program. Pre and post intervention questionnaires measured patient satisfaction with the program, side effect bother, and self-efficacy to manage ADT side effects. The ADT Educational Program was deemed feasible and acceptable. Five of six targeted sites successfully launched the program with sufficient patient enrolment. Patient attendees were highly satisfied. Self-efficacy, bother, and use of management strategies were interrelated. Lower bother was associated with increased self-efficacy and more use of management strategies, and increased bother was associated with lower self-efficacy and less use of management strategies. Based on pre-post scores, improvements in patients' self-efficacy to manage ADT side effects were also observed. Results demonstrate that this brief educational program is feasible and acceptable to patients and cancer care institutions.

Additionally, a new expression for optimum restricted LETd calculation is derived, allowing for disregarding straggling-associated functions in the classical microdosimetric theory. Restricted LETd and [Formula: see text] for polyenergetic beams can be obtained by integrating previously developed energy-dependent microdosimetric functions over the energetic spectrum of these beams. This calculation is extended to the entire calculation volume using an algorithm to determine spectral fluence. Equivalently, unrestricted LETd can be obtained integrating the stopping power curve on the spectrum. A new expression to calculate restricted LETd is also derived. Results for traditional and new formulas are compared for a clinical 100 MeV proton beam. Distributions of unrestricted LETd, restricted LETd and [Formula: see text] are analyzed for a prostate case, for microscopic spherical sites of 1 µm and 10 µm in diameter. Traditional and new expressions for restricted LETd remarkably agree, being the mean differences 0.05 ± 0.04 keV µm-1 for the 1 µm site and 0.05 ± 0.02 keV µm-1 for the 10 µm site. In the prostate case, the ratio between the maximum and the central value for central axis (CAX) profiles is around 2 for all the quantities, being the highest for restricted LETd for 1 µm (2.17) and the lowest for [Formula: see text] for 1 µm (1.78). Unrestricted LETd, restricted LETd and [Formula: see text] can be analytically computed and compared for clinical plans.

Objective:   To characterize US national trends and the clinical and socioeconomic factors associated with the use of stereotactic body radiotherapy in prostate cancer.  Design, setting, and participants:   This retrospective cohort study used data collected by the National Cancer Database to assess the clinical and socioeconomic factors among 106 926 men diagnosed as having prostate cancer from 2010 to 2015 who underwent definitive radiotherapy and the trends in the use of this therapy. The initial analysis was performed between January and February 2018, with final updates performed August 2019.  Exposure:   Stereotactic body radiotherapy, defined as 5 fractions of radiotherapy.  Main outcomes and measures:   Temporal trends and clinical and sociodemographic factors associated with stereotactic body radiotherapy use.  Results:   In total, 106 926 patients diagnosed as having localized prostate cancer between 2010 and 2015 and receiving definitive radiotherapy were identified. White patients composed 77.3% of this cohort, whereas black patients composed 18.7%. Government-issued insurance was used by 61.2% of patients. More than 80% of patients had a Charlson-Deyo Comorbidity Index score of 0 (range, 0 to ≥3, with lower numbers indicating fewer comorbidities). In the study population, 25.7% had low-risk disease; 26.3%, favorable intermediate-risk disease; 23.3%, unfavorable intermediate-risk disease; and 24.7%, high-risk disease. The proportion of patients who underwent radiotherapy and received stereotactic body radiotherapy (a total of 5395 patients) increased from 3.1% in 2010 to 7.2% in 2015 (odds ratio, 0.36; 95% CI, 0.33-0.40; P < .001). Among the entire cohort, patients received a median dose of 36.25 Gy (range, 30.00-50.00 Gy). Androgen deprivation therapy use increased significantly as disease risk level increased among all patients receiving radiotherapy (9.5% with low risk to 76.6% with high risk; P = .02) and among those receiving stereotactic body radiotherapy (4.1% with low risk to 33.2% with high risk; P = .04) or not receiving stereotactic body radiotherapy (9.9% with low risk to 77.6% with high risk; P = .04). Patients treated at an academic center, living in an urban area, or possessing higher incomes and those who were healthier, white individuals, or were diagnosed as having lower-risk prostate cancer had higher odds of receiving stereotactic body radiotherapy.  Conclusions and relevance:   This study found that stereotactic body radiotherapy use in prostate cancer more than doubled from 2010 to 2015 but accounted for less than 10% of all patients undergoing radiotherapy. Androgen deprivation therapy use increased with disease risk among patients overall, regardless of receiving stereotactic body radiotherapy. Socioeconomic and clinical determinants of stereotactic body radiotherapy included risk category, Charlson-Deyo Comorbidity Index score, facility type and location, income, race/ethnicity, and year of diagnosis. These results are hypothesis generating; further studies evaluating potential disparities in stereotactic body radiotherapy use in localized prostate cancer are warranted.""","""['Sean S Mahase', ""Debra D'Angelo"", 'Josephine Kang', 'Jim C Hu', 'Christopher E Barbieri', 'Himanshu Nagar']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""JAMA Netw Open""","""['Omission in Funding/Support.', 'Regional Variation in Active Surveillance for Low-Risk Prostate Cancer in the US.', 'Association of Sociodemographic and Health-Related Factors With Receipt of Nondefinitive Therapy Among Younger Men With High-Risk Prostate Cancer.', 'Travel distance and stereotactic body radiotherapy for localized prostate cancer.', 'Racial Disparity in Response to Prostate Cancer Systemic Therapies.', 'Prostate cancer treatment outcome in blacks and whites: a summary of the literature.', 'Patterns of utilization and clinical adoption of 0.35 Tesla MR-guided radiation therapy in the United States - Understanding the transition to adaptive, ultra-hypofractionated treatments.', 'Second generation anti-androgens and androgen deprivation therapy with radiation therapy in the definitive management of high-risk prostate cancer.', 'Trends in Radiation Oncology Treatment Fractionation at a Single Academic Center, 2010 to 2020.', 'Clinical adoption patterns of 0.35 Tesla MR-guided radiation therapy in Europe and Asia.', 'Towards Accurate and Precise Image-Guided Radiotherapy: Clinical Applications of the MR-Linac.']"""

Here, we determined the antiproliferative activity of a natural product manzamine A (1) from an Indo-Pacific sponge following various in vitro cellular assays targeting cervical cancer (C33A, HeLa, SiHa, and CaSki). Our data demonstrated the antiproliferative effects of 1 at relatively low and non-cytotoxic concentrations (up to 4 μM). Mechanistic investigations confirmed that 1 blocked cell cycle progression in SiHa and CaSki cells at G1/S phase and regulated cell cycle-related genes, including restoration of p21 and p53 expression. In apoptotic assays, HeLa cells showed the highest sensitivity to 1 as compared to other cell types (C33A, SiHa, and CaSki). Interestingly, 1 decreased the levels of the oncoprotein SIX1, which is associated with oncogenesis in cervical cancer. To further investigate the structure-activity relationship among manzamine A (1) class with potential antiproliferative activity, molecular networking facilitated the efficient identification, dereplication, and assignment of structures from the manzamine class and revealed the significant potential in the design of optimized molecules for the treatment of cervical cancer. These data suggest that this sponge-derived natural product class warrants further attention regarding the design and development of novel manzamine analogues, which may be efficacious for preventive and therapeutic treatment of cancer.

We here evaluated our clinical data on eLRP with 3 trocars.  Materials and Methods:   All consecutive patients undergoing eLRP in similar surgical procedures by two different surgeons (Y.A. & R.L.M.) between 2017 and 2018 at two different centres were included. Various clinical data including patients’ demographics, intraoperative and postoperative data, complications, and follow-up were recorded and analysed. We are presenting a video of one such case of eLRP with simultaneously right inguinal hernia repair with using 3 trocars. Surgeons in different clinics performed similar modified surgical technique (Heilbronn technique) (1) for eLRP with 3 trocars.  Results:   There were 28 cases in total (10 cases in Clinic 1 and 18 cases in Clinic 2). Mean follow-up was 8±0.4 months. Mean age was 69±3.2 years old. Mean prostate specific antigen was 8.8±1.2ng/dl. Mean operating time was 128±20.2 min. Mean estimated blood loss was 195±87.5 ml. Mean hospitalization day was 2.8±1 days. Mean catheter removal day was 8.8±3.6 days. Surgical margin was negative for all cases with 3 complications (Clavien 2) without major complications.  Conclusions:   The first advantage of this technique is using just one assistant holding laparoscopic optic. Second one is to have similar results with traditional eLRP with fewer trocars. Indirectly, more cosmesis is third one, as our approach seems more minimally invasive than traditional eLRP. eLRP with simultaneously hernia repair is feasible, safe, and effective with using just 3 trocars in selected cases.""","""['Yigit Akin', 'Rodrigo Leon Mar', 'Sakip Erturhan', 'Osman Kose', 'Sacit Nuri Gorgel']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Int Braz J Urol""","""['Simultaneous laparoscopic prosthetic mesh inguinal herniorrhaphy during transperitoneal laparoscopic radical prostatectomy.', 'Laparoscopic transperitoneal inguinal hernioplasty (TAPP) after radical open retropubic prostatectomy: special features and clinical outcomes.', 'The relationship between inguinal hernia and minimally-invasive surgery for prostate cancer: A systematic review of the literature.', 'The impact of previous laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair on radical prostatectomy.', 'Outcomes of Minimally Invasive Inguinal Hernia Repair at the Time of Robotic Radical Prostatectomy.']"""

However, CRT is still associated with several obstacles, including the increases in side effects and systemic toxicity. Incorporating nanocarriers into CRT is a new and exciting approach to solve these obstacles. The purpose of the present study was to design a unique pH- and ultrasound-responsive perfluoropentane-encapsulated, paclitaxel (PTX)-loaded carboxymethyl chitosan nanodroplets (NDs) for combined imaging and synergistic CRT.  Materials and methods:   The NDs were prepared by a homogenization/emulsion method. Their physicochemical properties, echogenicity and biocompatibility were evaluated. PTX-loaded NDs with a high loading efficiency and encapsulation efficiency were prepared and their pH-responsive drug release profile was determined by dialysis sack method. Then, PC3 cells were exposed to (1) PTX (4 μg/mL), (2) NDs (30 μg/mL), (3) PTX-loaded NDs (34 μg/mL), (4) RT (6 Gy), (5) RT (10 Gy), (6) combination of PTX (4 μg/mL), ultrasound (0.5 W/cm2, 30 s) and RT (6 Gy), (7) combination of NDs (30 μg/mL), ultrasound (0.5 W/cm2, 30 s) and RT (6Gy), (8) combination of PTX-loaded NDs (30 μg/mL), ultrasound (0.5 W/cm2, 30 s) and RT (6 Gy). 24 hrs later, CCK-8 assay, flow cytometry and migration assay were carried out to evaluate their therapeutic effects in CRT.  Results:   The desired NDs were successfully prepared, which were with round, spherical shapes, relatively smooth surfaces, core-shell structures and uniform in sizes (<300 nm with PDI<0.3 when at pH≧6.0). The NDs exhibited good abilities in pH-dependent charge conversion, biocompatibility and ultrasound contrast echogenicity. The in vitro drug release from PTX-loaded NDs (the highest loading efficiency and encapsulation efficiency were 20.35% and 91.58%) was pH dependent and exhibited an initial burst followed by a sustained drug release. The results of the CCK-8 assay, flow cytometry and migration assay all showed PTX-loaded NDs combined ultrasound and RT significantly enhanced cell responses in CRT.

Methods:   Herein, a PPDDS with pH-induced surface charge-reversal and reactive oxygen species (ROS) amplification for ROS-triggered self-accelerating drug release was developed, which was formed by encapsulating a ROS generation agent (vitamin K3 (VK3)) in pH/ROS dual-sensitive polymetric prodrug (PEG-b-P(LL-g-TK-PTX)-(LL-g-DMA)) based micelle nanoparticles (denoted as PVD-NPs).  Results:   The surface charge of the PVD-NPs can change from negative to positive for enhanced cell uptake in response to tumor extracellular acidity pH. After internalization by cancer cells, PVD-NPs demonstrate dual drug release in response to intracellular ROS-rich conditions. In addition, the released VK3 can produce ROS under the catalysis by NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase-1, which facilitates tumor-specific ROS amplification and drug release selectively in cancer cells to enhance chemotherapy.

Prostate cancer poses a large economic burden, which increases with progression from localized to metastatic disease. Newly approved treatments for non-metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (nmCRPC) delay disease progression and reduce the risk of metastatic disease. Quantifying the potential budget impact of these new treatments is of interest to health care decision makers.  Objective:   To estimate the budget impact of enzalutamide for the treatment of patients with nmCRPC in the United States over a 3-year time horizon.  Methods:   An Excel-based model was developed to estimate the budget impact to a U.S. health plan of enzalutamide, a second-generation antiandrogen, as an add-on to androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) for the treatment of high-risk nmCRPC patients (prostate-specific antigen doubling time of ≤ 10 months). Comparators include apalutamide + ADT, bicalutamide + ADT, and ADT only. The analysis includes treatment costs for nmCRPC and for treatment after progression to metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). The treated population size was estimated from epidemiological data and literature. Dosing, duration of therapy, and adverse event rates were based on package inserts and pivotal studies. RED BOOK, Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services fee schedules, and literature were used to obtain costs of drugs, adverse events, and health care visits. Market shares were estimated for each comparator before and after enzalutamide adoption. A 1-way sensitivity analysis was performed to quantify the impact of parameter uncertainty.  Results:   In a hypothetical 1-million-member plan with 3% annual growth, it was estimated that there would be approximately 19 eligible incident nmCRPC patients in year 1, increasing to 20 eligible incident patients in year 3. With an assumed market share of approximately 6% for enzalutamide in year 1, the budget impact would be $106,074 ($0.009 per member per month [PMPM]). With a 26% enzalutamide share in year 3, the budget impact would be $632,729 ($0.048 PMPM). Cumulative budget impact to the health plan over 3 years is estimated to be $1,082,095 ($0.028 PMPM). The increased cost of the treatment regimen is partly offset by reduced postprogression costs.  Conclusions:   Treatment of nmCRPC patients with enzalutamide has a modest budget impact that is partly offset by delaying progression to mCRPC.

However, information on genome‑wide gene alterations and the transcriptome is currently only available for PCa patients from Western countries. In order to profile the genetic alterations in Japanese patients with PCa, new panels were created to examine nucleotide sequence variations in 71 selected PCa‑related genes (KCC71) and to detect all fusion RNA transcripts known in PCa (PCaFusion). An analysis of 21 Japanese PCa cases identified 33 different somatic variants in 24 genes in the KCC71 panel, including 2 in SPOP (F102V and F133L), 2 in BRCA2 (I1859fs and R2318ter, resulting in premature termination of the polypeptide), and 1 each in BRAF (K601E), CDH1 (E880K) and RB1 (R621S), as pathogenic alterations. Unexpectedly, the TMPRSS2‑ERG fusion transcript was detected in only 1 case, although the SLC45A3‑ELK4 and USP9Y‑TTTY15 fusion transcripts, known as transcription‑mediated chimeric RNAs, were detected in all examined cases. A new pathway analysis with The Cancer Network Galaxy (TCNG), a cancer gene regulatory network database, was also applied in an attempt to predict molecular pathways implicated in PCa in the Japanese population. Based on the 24 genes having somatic variants identified by the panel analysis as initial seed genes, a putative core network was finally established, including 5 identified genes, namely TNK2, SOX9, CDH1, FOXA1 and TP53, with high commonality from TCNG datasets. These genes are expected to be involved in tumor development, as revealed by the results of an enrichment analysis with Gene Ontology terms.

We examined whether it was more efficacious to commence exercise at the onset of ADT rather than later in treatment to counter declines in strength and physical function.  Methods:   One-hundred-and-four men with PCa (68.3 ± 7.0 years) initiating ADT were randomised to immediate exercise (IMX, n = 54) or delayed exercise (DEL, n = 50) for 12 months. IMX comprised 6 months of supervised resistance/aerobic/impact exercise initiated at the onset of ADT with a 6-month follow-up. DEL comprised 6 months of usual care followed by 6 months of resistance/aerobic/impact exercise. Upper and lower body muscle strength and physical function were assessed at baseline, 6 and 12 months.  Results:   There was a significant difference for all strength measures at 6 months favouring IMX (P < 0.001), with net differences in leg press, seated row and chest press strength of 19.9 kg (95% CI, 12.3-27.5 kg), 5.6 kg (3.8-7.4 kg) and 4.3 kg (2.7-5.8 kg), respectively. From 7 to 12 months, DEL increased in all strength measures (P < 0.001), with no differences between groups at 12 months. Similarly, physical function improved (P < 0.001) in IMX compared with DEL at 6 months for the 6-m fast walk (-0.2, 95% CI -0.3 to -0.1 s), 400-m walk (-9.7, -14.8 to -4.6 s), stair climb (-0.4, -0.6 to -0.2 s) and chair rise (-1.0, -1.4 to -0.7 s), with no differences between groups by 12 months, except for the 6-m fast walk (P < 0.001).  Conclusion:   Exercise either at the onset or after 6 months of ADT preserves/enhances muscle strength and physical function.

However, its role in prostate cancer progression remains unclear. Here, we found JMJD1A was significantly elevated in prostate cancer tissue compared with matched normal tissue. Ectopic JMJD1A expression in prostate cancer cells promoted proliferation, migration, and invasion in vitro, and tumorigenesis in vivo; JMJD1A knockdown exhibited the opposite effects. Mechanically, we revealed that JMJD1A directly interacted with the Snail gene promoter and regulated its transcriptional activity, promoting prostate cancer progression both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, we found that JMJD1A transcriptionally activated Snail expression via H3K9me1 and H3K9me2 demethylation at its special promoter region. In summary, our studies reveal JMJD1A plays an important role in regulating proliferation and progression of prostate cancer cells though Snail, and thus highlight JMJD1A as potential therapeutic target for advanced prostate cancer.

Thus, we sought to determine the mechanism by which 27HC exerts its anti-prostate cancer effects. As cholesterol is a major component of membrane microdomains known as lipid rafts, which localize receptors and facilitate cellular signaling, we hypothesized 27HC would impair lipid rafts, using the IL6-JAK-STAT3 axis as a model given its prominent role in prostate cancer. As revealed by single molecule imaging of DU145 prostate cancer cells, 27HC treatment significantly reduced detected cholesterol density on the plasma membranes. Further, 27HC treatment of constitutively active STAT3 DU145 prostate cancer cells reduced STAT3 activation and slowed tumor growth in vitro and in vivo. 27HC also blocked IL6-mediated STAT3 phosphorylation in nonconstitutively active STAT3 cells. Mechanistically, 27HC reduced STAT3 homodimerization, nuclear translocation, and decreased STAT3 DNA occupancy at target gene promoters. Combined treatment with 27HC and STAT3 targeting molecules had additive and synergistic effects on proliferation and migration, respectively. Hallmark IL6-JAK-STAT gene signatures positively correlated with CYP27A1 gene expression in a large set of human metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancers and in an aggressive prostate cancer subtype. This suggests STAT3 activation may be a resistance mechanism for aggressive prostate cancers that retain CYP27A1 expression. In summary, our study establishes a key mechanism by which 27HC inhibits prostate cancer by disrupting lipid rafts and blocking STAT3 activation.

However, its functional roles and oncogenic mechanisms in prostate cancer (PCa) are poorly understood. Here, we investigated the roles and underlying molecular mechanisms of SIRT7 in PCa cell growth and androgen-induced autophagy.  Methods:   The LNCap and 22Rv1 PCa cell lines were subjected to quantitative reverse transcription (RT)-PCR to characterize their genes encoding SIRT7, AR, and SMAD4. The proteins produced from these genes were quantified by western blotting and immunoprecipitation analysis. SIRT7-depleted cells were produced by transfection with plasmid vectors bearing short hairpin RNAs against SIRT7. The proliferation of each cell line was assessed by CCK8 and EdU assays. Autophagic flux was tracked by mRFP-GFP-LC3 adenovirus under an immunofluorescence microscope. Apoptosis was evaluated by flow cytometry. Tumors were induced in mouse axillae by injection of the cell lines into mice. Tumor morphology was examined by immunohistochemistry and relative tumor growth and metastases were compared by a bioluminescence-based in vivo imaging system.  Results:   SIRT7 depletion significantly inhibited cell proliferation, androgen-induced autophagy, and invasion in LNCap and 22Rv1 cells (in vitro) and mouse xenograft tumors induced by injection of these cells (in vivo). SIRT7 knockdown also increased the sensitivity of PCa cells to radiation. Immunohistochemical analysis of 93 specimens and bioinformatic analysis revealed that SIRT7 expression was positively associated with androgen receptor (AR). Moreover, the AR signal pathway participated in SIRT7-mediated regulation of PCa cell proliferation, autophagy, and invasion. SIRT7 depletion downregulated the AR signal pathway by upregulating the level of SMAD4 protein in PCa cells.

We aimed to develop a preoperative nomogram to identify what kinds of patients can get the most survival benefits after RP.  Methods:   We conducted analyses with data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database. Covariates used for analyses included age at diagnosis, marital status, race, American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) 7th TNM stage, Prostate specific antigen, Gleason biopsy score (GS), percent of positive cores. We estimated the cumulative incidence function for cause-specific death. The Fine and Gray's proportional subdistribution hazard approach was used to perform multivariable competing risk analyses and reveal prognostic factors. A nomogram was built by these factors (including GS, percent of positive cores and N stage) and validated by concordance index and calibration curves. Risk stratification was established based on the nomogram.  Results:   We studied 14,185 patients. N stage, GS, and percent of positive cores were the independent prognostic factors used to construct the nomogram. For validating, in the training cohort, the C-index was 0.779 (95% CI 0.736-0.822), and in the validation cohort, the C-index was 0.773 (95% CI 0.710-0.836). Calibration curves showed that the predicted survival and actual survival were very close.

No effective treatment exists for BPH owing to lack of a clear understanding of its molecular etiology. Although several studies have reported therapeutic effects of baicalin against numerous diseases, including prostate cancer, its beneficial effects on BPH have not yet been explored. The present study investigated the therapeutic effects of baicalin on the development of BPH and its mechanism of action. We established a testosterone-treated BPH animal model and DHT-stimulated prostate cell lines, including RWPE-1 and WPMY-1. Administration of baicalin ameliorated the pathological prostate enlargement, suppressed the production of DHT, and inhibited the activity of 5α- reductase Type II in the animal model. BC exerted these effects via its anti-proliferative effects by restoring the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio, activating caspase-3 and caspase-8, and inducing the phosphorylation of AMPK. In vitro studies using DHT-stimulated prostate cells demonstrated an up-regulation of BPH-related and proliferation markers, whereas baicalin clearly reduced the overexpression of AR, PSA, PCNA, and Bcl-2. These results suggested that baicalin could suppress androgen-dependent development of BPH both in vivo and in vitro by inducing apoptosis.""","""['Bo-Ram Jin', 'Hyo-Jin An']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Aging (Albany NY)""","""['Psoralea corylifolia L. extract ameliorates benign prostatic hyperplasia by regulating prostate cell proliferation and apoptosis.', 'Quisqualis indica Improves Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia by Regulating Prostate Cell Proliferation and Apoptosis.', 'Cynanchum wilfordii Ameliorates Testosterone-Induced Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia by Regulating 5α-Reductase and Androgen Receptor Activities in a Rat Model.', 'Dihydrotestosterone and the concept of 5alpha-reductase inhibition in human benign prostatic hyperplasia.', '5alpha-reductase activity in the prostate.', 'Sinomenine Hydrochloride Can Ameliorate Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia by Lowering the 5α-Reductase 2 Level and Regulating the Balance between the Proliferation and Apoptosis of Cells.', 'Upregulation of mir-1199-5p is associated with reduced type 2 5-α reductase expression in benign prostatic hyperplasia.', 'Alterations of gut microbiota diversity, composition and metabonomics in testosterone-induced benign prostatic hyperplasia rats.', 'Prostate cancer: Therapeutic prospect with herbal medicine.', 'Oral administration of berberine represses macrophage activation-associated benign prostatic hyperplasia: a pivotal involvement of the NF-κB.']"""

We estimated the preventive effect of surveillance colonoscopy by applying the recently developed metric of adenoma dwell time avoided needed to prevent 1 CRC case (DTA).  Methods:   We followed subjects in the prostate, lung, colorectal and ovarian (PLCO) cancer screening trial who underwent colonoscopies following positive findings from sigmoidoscopies (colonoscopy cohort, n = 15,935) for CRC incidence for 10 years. The number and timing of adenomas removed during surveillance were measured in a subset (n = 3492) of patients and extrapolated to the entire cohort to estimate the total avoided adenoma dwell time. A previously determined DTA value of 612 dwell years was applied to estimate the number of CRC cases prevented by surveillance. Proportional reduction in CRC was computed as CP/(CO+CP), where CO and CP are observed and estimated prevented cases, respectively.  Results:   In the colonoscopy cohort of the PLCO, 2882 subjects had advanced adenomas (AAs), 572 had 3 or more non-advanced adenomas (NAA3+), 4496 had 1-2 non-advanced adenomas (NAA1-2), and 7985 had no adenoma (NA). The mean number of subsequent colonoscopy examinations over 10 years were 1.80 for subjects with AAs, 1.63 for subjects with NAA3+, and 1.46 for subjects with NAA1-2. Average years of avoided adenoma dwell time per subject were 4.0 for subjects with AAs, 5.5 for subjects with NAA3+, and 2.4 for subjects with NAA1-2. There were 56 cases of CRC in subjects with AAs, 4 cases of CRC in subjects with NAA3+, and 33 cases of CRC in subjects with NAA1-2. Estimated proportional reductions in CRC incidence were 25.0% in subjects with AAs (95% CI, 16%-34%), 34.4% in subjects with NAA1-2 (95% CI, 25%-40%), and 30.4% overall (in subjects with AAs, NAA3+, or NAA1-2; 95% CI, 25%-40%). Absolute CRC incidence reductions were 7.1 per 10,000 PY in subjects with AAs and 4.1 per 10,000 PY in subjects with NAA1-2.  Conclusions:   Using the recently developed metric of DTA, we estimated that surveillance colonoscopy in the PLCO colonoscopy cohort during 10 years of follow up prevented 30% of CRC cases.

However, treatment response shows racial differences. We aimed to propose a novel definition for ""high-volume"" prostate cancer in Asians.  Methods:   We retrospectively pursued 426 patients with de novo mCNPC from multiple institutions between 1999 and 2017. All patients received androgen deprivation therapy alone as initial treatment. We evaluated the number of bone metastases at diagnosis to clarify the clinical significance for progression-free survival and overall survival (OS). Statistical analyses were conducted using the Mann-Whitney U test, Cox proportional hazard models, and Kaplan-Meier methods.  Results:   Median age and prostate-specific antigen level were 73 years and 266.2 ng/ml, respectively. Median OS was 55.5 months in patients who met the CHAARTED high criteria (vs 33.1 months in the trial). We evaluated 5 thresholds in the number of bone metastases (≥4, ≥6, ≥11, ≥16, and ≥21) to investigate the prognostic values. Patients with ≥11 bone metastases showed the highest HR for OS (2.766). Patients with 11 to 20 bone metastases had a significantly shorter OS than those with ≤10 metastases (P = .0001). We, therefore, proposed modified CHAARTED and LATITUDE high criteria (extending bone metastases ≥11). In multivariate analysis, the modified criteria were the only independent prognostic factors for OS (P = .0272 and P = .042, respectively). Conversely, no significant differences in OS were seen between patients with 1 to 3 bone metastases and 4 to 10 (P = .7513).

A major challenge in PC immunotherapy is the lack of an animal model that resembles human adenocarcinoma and allows for manipulation or monitoring of the immune response. Mouse models are needed for preclinical testing of new immunotherapies, whether used alone or in combination with established drugs, and to develop companion biomarkers that can be validated in clinical trials.  Methods:   To develop a syngeneic prostate adenocarcinoma model with a well-defined tumor antigen, murine RM1 PC cells were transfected with the endogenous mouse melanoma protein, gp100 (RM1-gp100). Gp100 was attractive because it is a self-protein and it instantly allowed us to use the large trove of immune research tools developed for melanoma research. A dendritic cell (DC) vaccine was used as model immunotherapy to demonstrate that adoptive immunotherapy against gp100 decreases the growth of RM1-gp100 but not RM1.  Results:   Expressing gp100 did not change the growth of RM1 cell in vitro or in vivo. The DCs pulsed with RM1-gp100 could be used to stimulate Pmel-1 lymphocyte proliferation and activation. Pmel-1 lymphocytes could be adoptively transferred into C57Bl/6 mice that were treated with DCs pulsed with RM1-gp100. The resulting Pmel-1 lymphocytes were monitored to assess the primary cellular immune response and memory response.

Often, a time-consuming trial-and-error tuning procedure is required. The purpose of this paper is to automatically configure an automated treatment planning algorithm for oropharyngeal cancer patients.  Methods:   Recently, we proposed a new procedure to automatically configure the reference point method (RPM), a fast automatic multi-objective treatment planning algorithm. With a well-tuned configuration, the RPM generates a single Pareto optimal treatment plan with clinically favorable trade-offs for each patient. The automatic configuration of the RPM requires a set of computed tomography (CT) scans with corresponding dose distributions for training. Previously, we demonstrated for prostate cancer planning with 12 objectives that training with only 9 patients resulted in high-quality configurations. This paper further develops and explores the new automatic RPM configuration procedure for head and neck cancer planning with 22 objectives. Investigations were performed with planning CT scans of 105 previously treated unilateral or bilateral oropharyngeal cancer patients together with corresponding Pareto optimal treatment plans. These plans were generated with our clinically applied two-phase ε-constraint method (Erasmus-iCycle) for automated multi-objective treatment planning, ensuring consistent high quality and Pareto optimality of all plans. Clinically relevant, nonconvex criteria, such as dose-volume parameters and NTCPs, were included to steer the RPM configuration.  Results:   Training sets with 20-50 patients were investigated. Even with 20 training plans, high-quality configurations of the RPM were feasible. Automated plan generation with the automatically configured RPM resulted in Pareto optimal plans with overall similar or better quality than that of the Pareto optimal database plans.  Conclusions:   Automatic configuration of the RPM for automated treatment planning is feasible and drastically reduces the time and workload required when compared to manual tuning of an automated treatment planning algorithm.""","""['Rens van Haveren', 'Ben J M Heijmen', 'Sebastiaan Breedveld']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Automatically configuring the reference point method for automated multi-objective treatment planning.', 'A DVH-guided IMRT optimization algorithm for automatic treatment planning and adaptive radiotherapy replanning.', 'Fast and fuzzy multi-objective radiotherapy treatment plan generation for head and neck cancer patients with the lexicographic reference point method (LRPM).', 'Pareto optimality, economy-effectiveness trade-offs and ion channel degeneracy: improving population modelling for single neurons.', 'Implementation of automatic plan optimization in Italy: Status and perspectives.', 'Artificial Intelligence in Radiation Therapy.', 'Dose prediction with deep learning for prostate cancer radiation therapy: Model adaptation to different treatment planning practices.']"""

Deep learning-based methods have the potential to quickly predict the deformation vector field (DVF) in a few forward predictions. We have developed an unsupervised deep learning method for 4D-CT lung DIR with excellent performances in terms of registration accuracies, robustness, and computational speed.  Methods:   A fast and accurate 4D-CT lung DIR method, namely LungRegNet, was proposed using deep learning. LungRegNet consists of two subnetworks which are CoarseNet and FineNet. As the name suggests, CoarseNet predicts large lung motion on a coarse scale image while FineNet predicts local lung motion on a fine scale image. Both the CoarseNet and FineNet include a generator and a discriminator. The generator was trained to directly predict the DVF to deform the moving image. The discriminator was trained to distinguish the deformed images from the original images. CoarseNet was first trained to deform the moving images. The deformed images were then used by the FineNet for FineNet training. To increase the registration accuracy of the LungRegNet, we generated vessel-enhanced images by generating pulmonary vasculature probability maps prior to the network prediction.  Results:   We performed fivefold cross validation on ten 4D-CT datasets from our department. To compare with other methods, we also tested our method using separate 10 DIRLAB datasets that provide 300 manual landmark pairs per case for target registration error (TRE) calculation. Our results suggested that LungRegNet has achieved better registration accuracy in terms of TRE than other deep learning-based methods available in the literature on DIRLAB datasets. Compared to conventional DIR methods, LungRegNet could generate comparable registration accuracy with TRE smaller than 2 mm. The integration of both the discriminator and pulmonary vessel enhancements into the network was crucial to obtain high registration accuracy for 4D-CT lung DIR. The mean and standard deviation of TRE were 1.00 ± 0.53 mm and 1.59 ± 1.58 mm on our datasets and DIRLAB datasets respectively.  Conclusions:   An unsupervised deep learning-based method has been developed to rapidly and accurately register 4D-CT lung images. LungRegNet has outperformed its deep-learning-based peers and achieved excellent registration accuracy in terms of TRE.""","""['Yabo Fu', 'Yang Lei', 'Tonghe Wang', 'Kristin Higgins', 'Jeffrey D Bradley', 'Walter J Curran', 'Tian Liu', 'Xiaofeng Yang']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['4D-CT deformable image registration using multiscale unsupervised deep learning.', 'A multi-scale framework with unsupervised joint training of convolutional neural networks for pulmonary deformable image registration.', 'An unsupervised multi-scale framework with attention-based network (MANet) for lung 4D-CT registration.', 'Comparison of performances of conventional and deep learning-based methods in segmentation of lung vessels and registration of chest radiographs.', 'A Tour of Unsupervised Deep Learning for Medical Image Analysis.', 'Deep Learning for Medical Image-Based Cancer Diagnosis.', 'Survey of methods and principles in three-dimensional reconstruction from two-dimensional medical images.', 'Deformable registration of lung 3DCT images using an unsupervised heterogeneous multi-resolution neural network.', 'Learning deep abdominal CT registration through adaptive loss weighting and synthetic data generation.', 'Robust Measures of Image-Registration-Derived Lung Biomechanics in SPIROMICS.']"""

Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) plays a crucial role in PCa metastasis. Metabolic reprogramming offers metabolic advantages for cancer development and could result in the discovery of novel targets for cancer therapy. However, the metabolic features of PCa cells undergoing EMT remain unclear. We used metabolome and transcriptome analyses and found that PCa cells undergoing EMT showed impaired glucose utilization. In vitro studies demonstrated that PCa cells undergoing EMT were less addicted to glucose than epithelial-like PCa cells.

Previous studies have demonstrated the anti-tumor effect of miRNA-215-5p. However, its specific role in influencing the progression of prostate cancer (PCa) remains unclear. This study aims to uncover the regulatory effect of miRNA-215-5p on the metastasis and prognosis of PCa.  Patients and methods:   MiRNA-215-5p levels in collected PCa tissues (n=52) and paracancerous tissues (n=52) were determined by quantitative Real Time-Polymerase Chain Reaction (qRT-PCR). The relationship between miRNA-215-5p level and pathological indexes, as well as overall survival of PCa patients, was analyzed. Regulatory effects of miRNA-215-5p on proliferative and metastatic capacities of LNCaP and DU-145 cells were evaluated through cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) and transwell assay, respectively. Bioinformatics prediction was performed to search for the target genes of miRNA-215-5p and PGK1 was selected. The biological role of PGK1 in the progression of PCa was finally clarified by a series of rescue experiments.  Results:   MiRNA-215-5p was lowly expressed in PCa tissues and cell lines. Low level of miRNA-215-5p predicted poor prognosis in PCa patients. The silence of miRNA-215-5p enhanced viability, migratory, and invasive capacities of LNCaP cells, while the overexpression of miRNA-215-5p yielded the opposite trends in DU-145 cells. PGK1 was predicted to be the target of miRNA-215-5p. PGK1 was upregulated in PCa tissues and cell lines and its high level predicted poor prognosis of PCa. Moreover, PGK1 level was negatively correlated to that of miRNA-215-5p in PCa tissues. PGK1 was able to reverse the regulatory effects of miRNA-215-5p on metastatic potentials of PCa cells.  Conclusions:   Downregulated miRNA-215-5p in PCa is closely related to distant metastasis and poor prognosis of affected patients.

Taurine-upregulated gene 1 (TUG1) has been demonstrated to have a potential oncogenic role in PCa. Then the aim of this study was to investigate the molecular mechanisms of TUG1 on PCa progression.  Patients and methods:   The expression levels of TUG1, YES proto-oncogene 1 (YES1) mRNA and miR-128-3p were assessed using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Cell proliferation ability, apoptosis, and migration and invasion capacities were detected by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay, flow cytometry and transwell assay, respectively. Western blot analysis was employed to evaluate the indicated proteins levels. The interaction between miR-128-3p and TUG1 or YES1 was determined using the Dual-Luciferase reporter assay. In vivo assay was used to observe the effect of TUG1 on tumor growth in vivo.  Results:   Our data indicated that TUG1 was upregulated in PCa tissues and cells and predicted poor prognosis. TUG1 knockdown weakened PCa cell proliferation, migration, invasion, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and accelerated cell apoptosis in vitro. Mechanistically, TUG1 directly interacted with miR-128-3p and miR-128-3p mediated the regulatory effects of TUG1 depletion on PCa cell progression. YES1 was a direct target of miR-128-3p and TUG1 modulated YES1 expression by sponging miR-128-3p. Moreover, TUG1 silencing repressed PCa cell progression in vitro through YES1. Additionally, TUG1 silencing mitigated tumor growth in vivo.

However, due to the inclusion of a multitude of additional parameters its interpretation is becoming more challenging.  Objectives:   We aimed to determine how urologists currently interpret prostate biopsy reports, in particular how they consider different histopathological parameters for therapy decision-making.  Materials and methods:   A survey was sent to all urology practices in Germany with the help of the BDU (Berufsverband der Deutschen Urologen e. V.). In total, there were 106 complete responses that could be included for further analyses.  Results:   Most urologists consider the number of positive cores and relative tumor burden (%) per core as crucial for the assessment of tumor extension. In case of targeted biopsies, the majority of urologists prefers a separate statement of positive cores per random biopsy scheme and per region of interest, respectively. The core with the highest Gleason score is mostly the basis for therapy decision-making (versus the overall Gleason score). Proportion of Gleason 4 pattern also seems to be critical for prostate cancer management. Only half of the urologists demand reporting of the new ISUP/WHO (International Society of Urological Pathology/World Health Organization) grade groups. Additional parameters claimed are Ki67, prostate-specific membrane antigen status, presence of intraductal or neuroendocrine component of the tumor.

However, immune checkpoint inhibitors and active immunization have performed poorly in clinical trials. We developed a novel virus-like particle (VLP) vaccine composed of bovine papillomavirus L1 protein engineered to display surface docking sites. We decorated VLPs with peptides encoding T cell epitopes from two prostate cancer-associated tumor antigens, prostate stem cell antigen (PSCA), and prostatic acid phosphatase (PAP-1 and PAP-2), and a neo-antigen, stimulator of prostatic adenocarcinoma-specific T cells (SPAS-1). The VLP vaccines induced a mean frequency of antigen-specific IFN-γ secreting CD8 + T cells of 2.9% to PSCA, 9.5% to SPAS-1, 0.03% to PAP-1, and 0.03% to PAP-2 in tumor-bearing TRAMP mice. We treated TRAMP mice at 19-20 weeks of age, when mice have advanced stages of carcinogenesis, with either VLP vaccine, anti-PD1 antibody, or combination immunotherapy. The VLP vaccine alone or in combination with anti-PD1 antibody significantly reduced tumor burden, while anti-PD1 antibody had a modest non-significant therapeutic effect. All treatments significantly increased CD3 + and CD8 + T cell infiltration into tumor tissue compared to control mice, and combination therapy resulted in significantly greater CD3 + and CD8 + T cell infiltration than monotherapy. Reduction in tumor burden in vaccine-treated mice was inversely correlated with CD8 + T cell numbers in tumor tissue.

Genetically engineered mouse models reveal that ERG overexpression alone is not sufficient to induce tumorigenesis, but combined loss of PTEN results in an aggressive invasive phenotype. Here, we show that oncogenic ERG repressed PI3K signaling through direct transcriptional suppression of IRS2, leading to reduced RTK levels and activity. In accordance with this finding, ERG-positive human prostate cancers had a repressed AKT gene signature and transcriptional downregulation of IRS2. Although overexpression of IRS2 activated PI3K signaling, promoting cell migration in a PI3K-dependent manner, this did not fully recapitulate the phenotype seen with loss of PTEN as PI3K signaling is not as robust as observed in the setting of loss of PTEN. Importantly, deletions of the PTEN locus, which promotes active PI3K signaling, were among the most significant copy-number alterations that co-occurred with ERG genomic rearrangements.

Additionally, one of the common characteristics of many solid tumors, such as prostate cancer, is hypoxia. In this study, novel multifunctional PSMA inhibitors containing a PSMA-targeting moiety either with or without a hypoxia-sensitive moiety (18F-PEG3-ADIBOT-2NI-GUL and 18F-PEG3-ADIBOT-GUL, respectively; ADIBOT: azadibenzocyclooctatriazole, 2NI: 2-nitroimidazole) were designed and synthesized, and their feasibility as PET tracers for prostate cancer imaging studies was examined.

Micro-PET and biodistribution studies indicate that both 18F-labelled inhibitors successfully accumulated in prostate cancer regions, and 18F-PEG3-ADIBOT-2NI-GUL showed a 2-fold higher tumor-to-total non-target organ ratio than that of 18F-PEG3-ADIBOT-GUL, suggesting that the synergistic effects of the PSMA-targeting GUL moiety and the hypoxia-sensitive 2-nitroimidazole moiety can increase tumor uptake of the novel PET tracers in prostate cancer.

Detailed analysis of specific absorbance intensity ratios revealed the compositional changes in the secondary structure of proteins and membrane lipids. In this study, for the first time we examined the changes in these molecular components and linked them to deduce the involvement of molecular mechanisms in the XN-induced death of the selected cancer cells. We showed that XN concentration-dependent changes were attributed to phospholipid ester carbonyl groups, especially in the case of T47D cells, suggesting that XN acts as an inhibitor of cell proliferation. Additionally, we observed distinct changes in the region assigned to the absorption of DNA, which were correlated with a specific marker of cell death and dependent on the XN dose and the type of cancer cells. The microscopic observation and flow cytometry analysis revealed that the decrease in cancer cell viability was mainly related to the induction of necrotic cell death.

Methods:   Forty-nine positron emission tomography/computed tomography studies with radioactive choline (96 adrenal glands) were analysed with respect to the adrenal glands shape, uptake pattern and maximum standardised uptake value. Fifteen other parameters were recorded, assessed or counted, ratios of chosen parameters were calculated, and checked for correlation with adrenal glands uptake.  Results:   Adrenal glands presented a wide range of radioactive choline uptake intensities (range 2-7.9) and different uptake patterns (diffuse, focal or mixed). Maximum uptake in the right (4.3±1.2) adrenal gland positively correlated with the thickness of the parenchyma at the point of maximal uptake (5.3mm±1.5) (p=0.000). Maximum uptake in the right and left adrenal gland, as well as mean adrenal gland uptake, correlated with maximum uptake in the pituitary gland (p=0.000, p=0.000 and p=0.001, respectively) and with maximum uptake in liver (p=0.008, p=0.000 and p=0.011, respectively). Neither hormonal treatment nor patients' age significantly correlated with standardised uptake values of adrenal glands in the studied group.  Conclusions:   The variability of radiocholine uptake in adrenal glands depends probably on overall body metabolism and hypophyseal function expressed by statistically significant correlation with liver and pituitary gland uptake. Predominant focal or mixed with focal areas uptake patterns on positron emission tomography in normal in computed tomography adrenal glands should be assessed with caution to avoid a diagnostic mistake.""","""['E J Bialek', 'M Dziuk', 'E Witkowska-Patena', 'P Kwasiborski', 'S Piszczek']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Rev Esp Med Nucl Imagen Mol (Engl Ed)""","""['More advantages in detecting bone and soft tissue metastases from prostate cancer using 18F-PSMA PET/CT.', 'Adrenal tracer uptake by 18F-FDOPA PET/CT in patients with pheochromocytoma and controls.', 'Quantitative analysis of normal and pathologic adrenal glands with 18F-FDOPA PET/CT: focus on pheochromocytomas.', 'The role of positron emission tomography/computed tomography imaging with radiolabeled choline analogues in prostate cancer.', 'New Clinical Indications for (18)F/(11)C-choline, New Tracers for Positron Emission Tomography and a Promising Hybrid Device for Prostate Cancer Staging: A Systematic Review of the Literature.']"""

The androgen receptor (AR) is a nuclear hormone receptor that functions as a critical oncogene in several cancer progressions. However, whether RAI16 is a candidate AR target gene that may involve in prostate cancer progression was unclear.  Materials & methods:   RAI16 expression was detected in prostate cancer cells with or without the AR agonist R1881 treatment by quantitative RT-PCR and Western blot. Direct AR binding to the RAI16 promoter was tested using AR chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and luciferase assay. Cell viability and colony formation assays in response to R1881 were analyzed in cells with RAI16 knockdown by specific siRNA.  Results:   The expression of RAI16 was high in LNCaP(AI), LNCaP(AD), C4-2 expressing AR, but low in Du145 and Pc-3 cells without AR expressing. In addition, the expression of RAI16 could be induced by 10 nM R1881 treatment LNCaP(AD) and C4-2 cells, but inhibited by AR specific siRNA treatment. Furthermore, AR binds directly to ARE3 (-2003~-1982bp) of RAI16 promoter region by ChIP and luciferase assay. RAI16 knockdown inhibited the enhancement of cell viability and colony formation of AR stimulation.  Conclusions:   We demonstrate for the first time that RAI16 is a direct target gene of AR.

Methods:   A retrospective study on 2526 previously irradiated PCa patients was performed. Patients were treated with 3D-CRT (21.3%), IMRT (68.1%), or VMAT (10.6%).

The aberrant expression of miRNA (miR)-374b-5p has been observed in various types of cancers. The purpose of the current study was to evaluate the relationship between miR-374b-5p expression levels and PCa and to assess the feasibility of using peripheral blood miR-374b-5p as a potential non-invasive biomarker for PCa.  Methods:   Total RNA was isolated from the whole-blood samples of 42 PCa patients whole-blood samples, 42 benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) patients, and 42 healthy controls (HC). The expression of miR-374b-5p was assessed by reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Normalized data were subjected to the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) and Kaplan-Meier analysis.  Results:   The expression of peripheral blood miR-374b-5p was significantly higher in PCa patients than in HC individuals and patients with BPH (p < 0.001). Upregulation of miR-374b-5p was observed to be related to certain parameters, including Gleason score > 7 (p < 0.001), and PSA > 20 ng/mL (p < 0.01). To further evaluate the role of miR-374b-5p in patients with PCa, ROC analysis was carried out. Our data showed that peripheral blood miR-374b-5p could screen PCa patients from HC individuals (area under the curve (AUC), 0.851; 95% CI, 0.766 - 0.936; p < 0.001) and patients with BPH (AUC, 0.831; 95% CI, 0.742 - 0.920; p < 0.001).

However, the clinical translation of miRNAs requires the development of effective and safe delivery systems able to protect nucleic acids from degradation. Herein, biodegradable polyethyleneimine-functionalized polyhydroxybutyrate nanoparticles (PHB-PEI NPs) were prepared by aminolysis and used as cationic non-viral vectors to complex and deliver miR-124 in PC3 cells. Notably, the PHB-PEI NPs/miRNA complex effectively protected miR-124 from RNAse degradation, resulting in a 30% increase in delivery efficiency in PC3 cells compared to a commercial transfection agent (Lipofectamine RNAiMAX). Furthermore, the NPs-delivered miR-124 successfully impaired hallmarks of tumorigenicity, such as cell proliferation, motility, and colony formation, through CPT1A modulation.

Here, we examined its potential as a radiosensitizer in HCC radiotherapy using human HCC Hep3B and HepG2 cell lines and xenograft tumors. Mesima pretreatment significantly enhanced HCC cell radiosensitivity in vitro and the combination of mesima + radiation treatment significantly reduced xenograft tumor growth and size in vivo compared to those with single treatments. Mechanistically, mesima significantly enhanced radiotherapy efficiency by inhibiting tumor cell survival through inducing apoptosis (assessed via annexin V), impairing cell cycle regulation (shown by flow cytometry), and reducing radiation-induced DNA damage repair (measured via γ-H2AX foci). Combination treatment also facilitated autophagic cell death beyond that from single treatments (assessed by quantifying stained acidic vesicular organelles), and diminished tumor cell metastatic potentials (shown by wound and Transwell assays).

Materials and methods:   Within the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results registry (2001-2016), we identified patients with stage T1-T2N0M0 non-UCUB and UCUB who had undergone PC or RC. Non-UCUB included adenocarcinoma, squamous carcinoma, neuroendocrine carcinoma, and other histologic subtypes. First, CSM and OM after PC were compared between the non-UCUB and UCUB groups. Second, CSM and OM after PC were compared with RC in the non-UCUB group. Kaplan Meier plots and multivariable Cox regression models were used before and after inverse probability of treatment weighting.  Results:   Overall, 248 patients (16.3%) treated with PC had had non-UCUB. Of the 248 cases, 115 (46.5%), 50 (20%), 34 (14%), and 49 (19.5%) were adenocarcinoma, squamous carcinoma, neuroendocrine carcinoma, and other histologic subtypes, respectively. The comparison between PC in the non-UCUB and PC in the UCUB group showed higher CSM (hazard ratio, 1.4; P = .03) but the same OM rates (hazard ratio, 1.1; P = .7) in the non-UCUB group. The comparison between PC and RC for the non-UCUB group showed no CSM or OM differences.  Conclusions:   PC for non-UCUB was associated with higher CSM compared with PC for UCUB. However, PC instead of RC for select patients with non-UCUB appears not to undermine cancer-control outcomes. Thus, the excess CSM is probably unrelated to cystectomy type but could originate from differences in the tumor biology. These results could act as hypothesis generating for the design of future trials.""","""['Stefano Luzzago', 'Carlotta Palumbo', 'Giuseppe Rosiello', 'Sophie Knipper', 'Angela Pecoraro', 'Marina Deuker', 'Francesco Alessandro Mistretta', 'Zhe Tian', 'Gennaro Musi', 'Emanuele Montanari', 'Shahrokh F Shariat', 'Fred Saad', 'Alberto Briganti', 'Ottavio de Cobelli', 'Pierre I Karakiewicz']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Clin Genitourin Cancer""","""['Partial Cystectomy With Pelvic Lymph Node Dissection for Patients With Nonmetastatic Stage pT2-T3 Urothelial Carcinoma of Urinary Bladder: Temporal Trends and Survival Outcomes.', 'Increasing Rates of Perioperative Chemotherapy are Associated With Improved Survival in Men With Urothelial Bladder Cancer With Prostatic Stromal Invasion.', 'Contemporary Trends and Efficacy of Pelvic Lymph Node Dissection at Radical Cystectomy for Urothelial and Variant Histology Carcinoma of the Urinary Bladder.', 'Urethral recurrence after radical cystectomy for urothelial carcinoma: A systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'The Cancer of the Bladder Risk Assessment (COBRA) score accurately predicts cancer-specific survival after radical cystectomy: external validation and lymphovascular invasion assessment value to improve its performance.', 'An Unusual Location for a Nonurachal Bladder Adenocarcinoma.']"""

Methods and materials:   Patients with localized, clinical stage T1-4 prostate adenocarcinoma were treated at a single institution using conventionally fractionated, dose-escalated PBT from 2013 to 2018. Patient-reported gastrointestinal toxicity was prospectively collected, and the incidence of rectal bleeding was retrospectively reviewed from patient records.  Results:   One hundred ninety-two patients were treated with rectal balloon immobilization, and 75 were treated with a rectal spacer. Rectal hydrogel spacer significantly improved rectal dosimetry while maintaining excellent target coverage. The 2-year actuarial rate of grade 2+ late rectal bleeding was 19% and 3% in the rectal balloon and hydrogel spacer groups, respectively (P = .003). In univariable analysis, the probability of grade 2+ rectal bleeding was significantly correlated with increasing rectal dose. In multivariable analysis, only receipt of spacer hydrogel (hazard ratio, 0.145; P = .010) and anticoagulation use (hazard ratio, 5.019; P < .001) were significantly associated with grade 2+ bleeding. At 2-year follow-up, patient-reported Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite bowel quality of life composite scores were less diminished in the hydrogel spacer group (absolute mean difference, 5.5; P = .030).  Conclusions:   Use of rectal hydrogel spacer for prostate PBT is associated with a significantly lower incidence of clinically relevant, late rectal bleeding and lower decrement in long-term, patient-reported bowel quality of life compared with rectal balloon immobilization.

The development of prostate cancer independent of androgen is closely related to the action of neuroendocrine products. Serotonin promotes cell growth in various cancers, and antagonists for serotonin receptors are known to inhibit proliferation and induce cell death in various carcinomas. However, little is known about how antagonists for serotonin receptor function in prostate cancer. We verified apoptotic cell death in prostate cancer cell lines after treatment with methiothepin mesylate (MET), an antagonist for serotonin receptor 5-HT1. MET induced hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production and mitochondrial Ca2+ overload. Moreover, MET induced changes in the expression of proteins associated with endoplasmic reticulum stress, autophagy, and mitochondrial membrane potential. MET also promoted phosphorylation of JNK, which induced cell death mediated by oxidant production, as evidenced by the JNK inhibitor and oxidant scavenger. Finally, MET has the potential to prevent metastasis by inhibiting the migration of prostate cancer cells. Thus, we show that MET is a potentially novel anticancer agent that can suppress the development of prostate cancer caused by neuroendocrine differentiation.""","""['Changwon Yang', 'Gwonhwa Song', 'Whasun Lim']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Free Radic Biol Med""","""['Methiothepin Suppresses Human Ovarian Cancer Cell Growth by Repressing Mitochondrion-Mediated Metabolism and Inhibiting Angiogenesis In Vivo.', 'Shikonin selectively induces apoptosis in human prostate cancer cells through the endoplasmic reticulum stress and mitochondrial apoptotic pathway.', 'Tubeimoside-1 induces oxidative stress-mediated apoptosis and G0/G1 phase arrest in human prostate carcinoma cells in vitro.', 'Heteronemin, a Marine Sesterterpenoid-Type Metabolite, Induces Apoptosis in Prostate LNcap Cells via Oxidative and ER Stress Combined with the Inhibition of Topoisomerase II and Hsp90.', 'Chrysin induces death of prostate cancer cells by inducing ROS and ER stress.', 'Hesperidin Suppresses the Proliferation of Prostate Cancer Cells by Inducing Oxidative Stress and Disrupting Ca2+ Homeostasis.', 'Targeting Mitochondrial OXPHOS and Their Regulatory Signals in Prostate Cancers.', 'Methylglyoxal-Derived Advanced Glycation End Product (AGE4)-Induced Apoptosis Leads to Mitochondrial Dysfunction and Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress through the RAGE/JNK Pathway in Kidney Cells.', 'Methiothepin Suppresses Human Ovarian Cancer Cell Growth by Repressing Mitochondrion-Mediated Metabolism and Inhibiting Angiogenesis In Vivo.']"""

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first human study aimed to quantify the individual and joint effects of statin and metformin use among patients with high-risk PCa.  Methods:   This population-based retrospective cohort study identified patients from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-Medicare linked database. Exposure to metformin and statins was ascertained from Medicare Prescription Drug Event files. The association with all-cause and PCa mortality were evaluated using Cox proportional hazard model with competing causes of death, where propensity scores were used to adjusted imbalances in covariates across groups.  Results:   Based on 12 700 patients with high-risk PCa, statin alone or in combination with metformin was significantly associated with reduced all-cause mortality (Hazard Ratio [HR]: 0.89; 95% Confidence Interval [CI]: 0.83, 0.96; and HR: 0.75; 95% CI, 0.67-0.83, respectively) and PCa mortality (HR, 0.80; 95% CI: 0.69, 0.92) and 0.64; 95% CI, d 0.51-0.81, respectively. The effects were more pronounced in post-diagnostic users: combination use of metformin/statins was associated with a 32% reduction in all-cause mortality (95% CI, 0.57-0.80), and 54% reduction in PCa mortality (95% CI, 0.30-0.69). No significant association of metformin alone was observed with either all-cause mortality or PCa mortality.

We first confirmed that substantial quantities of cell-free DNA were present in the post-mortem plasma of 12 autopsy cases. Then, we focused on a pilot case of prostate cancer with multiple metastases for genetic analyses. Whole-exome sequencing of post-mortem plasma-derived cell-free DNA and eight frozen metastatic cancer tissues collected during rapid autopsy was performed, and compared their mutational statuses. The post-mortem plasma cell-free DNA was successfully sequenced and 344 mutations were identified. Of these, 160 were detected in at least one of the metastases. Further, 99% of the mutations shared by all metastases were present in the plasma. Sanger sequencing of 30 additional formalin-fixed metastases enabled us to map the clones harboring mutations initially detected only in the plasma.

Methods: In total, 31 patients with a previously negative prostate biopsy but persistent elevated serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) were imaged with a 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT ligand before undergoing repeat prostate biopsy. On the basis of the proposed Prostate Cancer Molecular Imaging Standardized Evaluation criteria, 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT results were interpreted as negative (molecular-imaging-for-PSMA expression score [miPSMA-ES] of 0-1) or positive (miPSMA-ES of 2-3). All patients underwent standard template systematic biopsy with up to 4 additional PET/ultrasound-guided biopsy cores. The sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, and accuracy of 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT were determined. In addition, the correlation between the miPSMA-ES and the detection rate of PCa was also analyzed. Univariate logistic regression models were established using 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT semiquantitative analysis parameters to predict the outcome of repeat prostate biopsy. Results: The median age of patients was 65 y (range, 53-81 y), and the median PSA level was 18.0 ng/mL (range, 5.48-49.77 ng/mL). PCa was detected in 15 of 31 patients (48.4%), and 12 of 31 patients (38.7%) had clinically significant PCa (csPCa). The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and accuracy of 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT in the diagnosis of csPCa were 100.0%, 68.4%, 66.7%, 100.0%, and 80.6%, respectively. The detection rate of PCa increased with the increase in miPSMA-ES. The detection rates of csPCa in the miPSMA-ES 0-1, 2, and 3 groups were 0%, 54.5%, and 85.7%, respectively. Semiquantitative analysis of 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT images showed that predictive models based on the SUVmax of prostate lesion, tumor-to-normal-prostate background SUVmax, and tumor-to-normal-liver background SUVmax could effectively predict csPCa; area under the curves were 0.930, 0.877, and 0.956, respectively. Conclusion: This study preliminarily confirmed that 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT imaging, combined with PET/ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy, can effectively detect csPCa.

Acquired reversions can restore BRCA1/2 function, causing resistance to PARPi and/or platinum-based chemotherapy. The optimal method of identifying patients with germline, somatic, and/or reversion mutations in BRCA1/2 has not been established. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) of cell-free DNA (cfDNA) provides a platform to identify these three types of BRCA1/2 mutations.  Experimental design:   Patients with advanced breast, ovarian, prostate, or pancreatic cancer were tested using a clinically validated 73-gene cfDNA assay that evaluates single-nucleotide variants and insertion-deletion mutations (indels) in BRCA1/2, and distinguishes somatic/reversion from germline mutations with high accuracy.  Results:   Among 828 patients, one or more deleterious BRCA1/2 mutations were detected in 60 (7.2%) patients, including germline (n = 42) and somatic (n = 18) mutations. Common coexisting mutations included TP53 (61.6%), MYC (30%), PIK3CA (26.6%), BRAF (15%), and ESR1 (11.5%). Polyclonal reversion mutations (median, 5) were detected in 9 of 42 (21.4%) germline BRCA1/2-mutant patients, the majority (77.7%) of whom had prior PARPi exposure (median duration, 10 months). Serial cfDNA demonstrated emergence of reversion BRCA mutations under therapeutic pressure from initial PARPi exposure, which contributed to subsequent resistance to PARPi and platinum therapy.  Conclusions:   cfDNA NGS identified high rates of therapeutically relevant mutations without foreknowledge of germline or tissue-based testing results, including deleterious somatic BRCA1/2 mutations missed by germline testing and reversion mutations that can have important treatment implications.

Prostatic biopsy constitutes the major pathology workload in prostate cancer and is the foundation for primary treatment decisions and for this reason we aimed to estimate the prognostic value of PNI in biopsies.  Methods:   We followed 918 men who underwent radical prostatectomy (RP) from the prospective and population based STHLM3 study until biochemical recurrence with a median follow-up of 4.1 years. To strengthen the evidence, we combined the estimates from the largest studies targeting the prognostic value of PNI in the biopsy. We also estimated the OR of advanced stage as radical prostatectomy for PNI positive and negative men.  Results:   The estimated prognostic value based on our data suggested an approximately 50% increased risk of biochemical recurrence if PNI was present in the biopsy (p=0.06). Even though not statistically significant on the 5% level, this estimate is consistent with similar studies, and by combining the estimates there is in fact strong evidence in support of an independent prognostic value of PNI in the biopsy (p<0.0001). There was also an independent increased risk of advanced stage at RP for positive men (OR 1.85, p=0.005).

We addressed the prognostic value of primary versus secondary biopsy Gleason 5 for GG 5 among 18 555 PCa patients treated with radical prostatectomy (RP) between 1992 and 2014. Of these, 922 patients had GG 5 PCa with primary (n=295) or secondary (n=627) Gleason 5 on biopsy. Prediction of biochemical recurrence (BCR), metastasis, and cancer-specific mortality (CSM) was assessed using Kaplan-Meier curves and univariable/multivariable Cox regression controlling for known prognosticators. Median follow-up was 74.8 mo (interquartile range [IQR] 49.2-120.2). BCR developed in 24.3% of patients (n=4508) at a median of 23.6 mo (IQR 7.1-48.6). Metastasis developed in 4.5% (n=827) and 2.0% (n=370) died of PCa. When stratifying GG 5 by primary versus secondary Gleason 5, the estimated 5-yr metastasis-free survival was 80.4% (95% confidence interval [CI] 76.1-85.0%) versus 86.9% (95% CI 84.2-89.7%; p= 0.002) and cancer-specific survival was 90.9% (95% CI 87.5-94.4%) versus 96.3% (95% CI 94.7-98.0%; p< 0.001). On multivariable analysis, the negative impact of primary biopsy Gleason 5 among GG 5 patients remained significant for metastasis (hazard ratio [HR] 1.58; p< 0.001) and CSM (HR 2.44; p< 0.001). Therefore, stratifying GG 5 into primary (5 + 4, 5 + 5) and secondary (4 + 5) Gleason 5 may be warranted.

Positive surgical margin (PSM), biochemical recurrence (BCR), metastasis-free survival (MFS), overall (OS) and cancer specific survival (CSS) were analysed according to upgrading and upstaging. Results: Upgrading was observed in 29% and upstaging in 22% of PCa patients. Patients undergoing upgrading or upstaging were 1.5 times more likely to have a PSM on RP pathology. Both upgrading and upstaging were associated with increased risk for BCR: 1.8 and 2.1 times, respectively.

In intervention practices, men were offered a genetic test (based on genotyping of 33 risk-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms) in addition to the standard PSA test that informed them about lifetime genetic risk of prostate cancer and distinguished between ""normal"" and ""high"" risk. The primary outcome was the proportion of men having a repeated PSA test within 2 years. A multilevel logistic regression model was used to test the association. After applying the exclusion criteria, 3,558 men were recruited in intervention practices, with 1,235 (34.7%) receiving the genetic test, and 4,242 men were recruited in control practices. Men with high genetic risk had a higher propensity for repeated PSA testing within 2 years than men with normal genetic risk (odds ratio [OR] = 8.94, p < 0.01). The study was conducted in routine practice and had some selection bias, which is evidenced by the relatively large proportion of younger and higher income participants taking the genetic test.  Conclusions:   Providing general practitioners (GPs) with access to a genetic test to assess lifetime risk of prostate cancer did not reduce the overall number of future PSA tests. However, among men who had a genetic test, knowledge of genetic risk significantly influenced future PSA testing.

However, little is known about their performance when conducting such examinations on real subjects.  Objective:   The aim of this paper is to better understand palpation techniques of experts whilst conducting a Digital Rectal Examination on a real subject.  Methods:   We recruited four consultants from relevant specialties and asked them to conduct two DREs on a Rectal Teaching Assistant whilst wearing small position and pressure sensors on their examining finger. We segmented the relevant anatomy from an MRI taken of the pelvic region, registered 3D models and analysed retrospectively performance in relation to executed tasks, supination/pronation, palpation convex hull and pressure applied.  Results:   Primary care consultants examined the anatomy more holistically compared to secondary care experts, the maximum pressure applied across experiments is 3.3N, overall the pressure applied on the prostate is higher than that applied to rectal walls, and the urologist participant not only applied the highest pressure but also did so with the highest most prominent frequency (15.4 and 25.3 Hz).  Conclusions:   The results of our research allow for better understanding of experts' technical performance from relevant specialities when conducting a DRE, and suggest the range of pressure applied whilst palpating anatomy.  Significance:   This research will be valuable in improving the design of haptics-based learning tools, as well as in encouraging reflection on palpation styles across different specialities to develop metrics of performance.""","""['Alejandro Granados', 'Seth Cox', 'Naomi Low-Beer', 'Jenny Higham', 'Roger Kneebone', 'Fernando Bello']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""IEEE Trans Biomed Eng""","""['Augmented Reality System for Digital Rectal Examination Training and Assessment: System Validation.', ""Real-time Visualisation and Analysis of Clinicians' Performance during Palpation in Physical Examinations."", ""Lost in translation: unfolding medical students' misconceptions of how to perform a clinical digital rectal examination."", 'Screening digital rectal examination and prostate cancer mortality: a population-based case-control study.', 'Comparison of digital rectal examination and biopsy results with the radical prostatectomy specimen.', 'Augmented Reality System for Digital Rectal Examination Training and Assessment: System Validation.']"""

Prediction of downgrading or FP may help identify potential active surveillance candidates within this group that have outcomes similar to biopsy low-risk (LR) disease.  Methods:   We performed a comparative cohort study of biopsy LR and IR men who underwent RP at The Johns Hopkins Hospital and Bayview Medical Center between 2005 and 2018. We evaluated pathological outcomes at RP and recurrence-free survival (RFS). Multivariable logistic regression and Cox proportional hazards regression were applied and individual predicted probabilities were calculated.  Results:   Among 2943 biopsy GG2 IR patients, 223 (7.6%) were downgraded to GG1, while 525 (17.8%) had FP; 730 of 1325 biopsy LR patients (55.1%) were upgraded (GG >1). Concordance statistics for final predictive regression models were 0.76 for downgrading and 0.70 for upgrading. Biopsy GG2 IR patients downgrading to GG1 or harboring FP had similar RFS to biopsy LR patients. A cutoff of >10% predicted probability of downgrading (24.7% of patients; hazard ratio [HR], 1.55; 95% CI, 0.89-2.68) or >20% predicted probability of FP (37.0% of patients; HR, 1.35; 95% CI, 0.81-2.24) led to similar RFS to biopsy LR patients.  Conclusion:   GG2 IR patients who experience downgrading or harbor FP had similar oncologic outcomes as LR patients.

Recent studies identified P504S markers of the clear cell histotype in the ovary and/or endometrium. Gastric-type adenocarcinoma (GAS) is difficult to diagnose histologically, particularly when there is crossover with clear cell carcinoma (CCC). However, the significance of P504S for differentially diagnosing GAS and CCC is unclear.  Aim:   To evaluate P504S as a potential diagnostic marker of GAS and CCC.  Settings and design:   We analyzed P504S expression in 48 cervical carcinomas (32 GAS and 16 CCC), as well as the expression of other markers including hepatocyte nuclear factor-1 beta (HNF-1β) and NapsinA.  Material and methods:   The expression differences of HNF-1β, NapsinA, and P504S in GAS and CCC were detected by immunohistochemistry. Immunohistochemical histoscores based on the intensity and extent of staining were calculated.  Results:   The positive rates of HNF-1β in GAS and CCC were 90.32% and 75%, respectively. (χ2 = 2.251, P = 0.663). The positive rates of NapsinA in GAS and CCC were 19.36% and 81.25%, respectively. (χ2 = 47.332, P < 0.01). The positive rates of P504S in GAS and CCC were 16.13% and 81.25%, respectively. (χ2 = 41.420, P < 0.01).

Hypotension often occurs on induction of anaesthesia, typically attributed to hypovolaemia and the haemodynamic effects of anaesthetic agents. We assessed the efficacy of fluid optimisation for reducing the incidence of hypotension on induction of anaesthesia. This prospective trial enrolled 283 patients undergoing radical cystectomy and randomly allocated them to goal-directed fluid therapy (n = 142) or standard fluid therapy (n = 141). Goal-directed fluid therapy patients received fluid optimisation based on stroke volume response to passive leg raise before induction; those with positive passive leg raise received intravenous crystalloid fluid boluses until stroke volume was optimised. Baseline mean arterial pressure was measured on the morning of surgery and on arriving in the operating theatre. This post-hoc analysis defined haemodynamic instability as either a > 30% relative drop in mean arterial pressure compared with baseline or absolute mean arterial pressure < 55 mmHg, within 15 min of induction. Forty-two (30%) goal-directed fluid therapy patients underwent fluid optimisation after finding an intravascular fluid deficit via passive leg raise testing; 106 (75%) goal-directed fluid therapy and 112 (79%) standard fluid therapy patients met criteria for haemodynamic instability. There was no significant difference in the incidence of haemodynamic instability between the goal-directed fluid therapy and standard fluid therapy groups using absolute mean arterial pressure drop below 55 mmHg (p = 0.58) or using pre-surgical testing or pre-surgical mean arterial pressure values as baseline (p = 0.21, p = 0.89, respectively); however, the difference in the incidence of haemodynamic instability was significant using the operating theatre baseline mean arterial pressure (p = 0.004).

EMT has been linked to prostate cancer metastatic potential, therapy resistance, and poor outcomes. Kinetin riboside (9-(b-dribofuranosyl)-6-furfurylaminopurine, KR) is a naturally occurring cytokinin, which induces apoptosis and shows strong antiproliferative activity against various human cancer cell lines. To establish the effect of KR on human prostate cell lines, expression of, e.g. AR, E-, N-cadherins, Vimentin, Snail, Twist, and MMPs, was analysed at mRNA and protein levels using Western Blot and RT-PCR and/or RQ-PCR techniques. KR inhibited the growth of human prostate cancer cells, but also, to a small extent, of normal cells. This effect depended on the type of the cells and their androgen sensitivity. KR also decreased the level of p-Akt, which takes part in androgen signalling modulation. The antiapoptotic Bcl-2 protein was down-regulated in cancer cell lines, while that of Bax is up-regulated upon KR exposure. KR contributed to re-expression of the E-cadherin as well as to significant changes in cell migration. Taken together, our results indicate for the first time that KR can be proposed as a factor for signalling pathways regulation that participates in the inhibition of development of aggressive forms of prostate cancer, and may alter the approach to therapeutic interventions.

Methods:   We used the Veterans Affairs Informatics and Computing Infrastructure to assemble a cohort of patients diagnosed with prostate cancer (PC) between 2000 and 2015. We collected patient-level demographic, comorbidity, and tumor data. We also assessed markers of preventive care utilization including cholesterol and prostate specific antigen (PSA) screening rates. Patients were considered prediagnosis statin users if they had at least one prescription one or more years prior to PC diagnosis. We evaluated PCSM using hierarchical Fine-Gray regression models and all-cause mortality (ACM) using a cox regression model.  Results:   The final cohort contained 68,432 men including 40,772 (59.6%) prediagnosis statin users and 27,660 (40.4%) nonusers.

The underlying mechanism of prostatic growth in this population is poorly understood. Here we addressed the question of how obesity, inflammation, and steroid hormones affect the development of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH).  Material and methods:   We used preadipocytes, macrophages, primary human prostatic stromal cells, prostate tissues from high-fat diet-induced obese mice, and 35 prostate specimens that were collected from patients who underwent transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP). RNA was isolated and quantified with RT-PCR. Genome DNA was extracted and SRD5A2 promoter methylation was determined. Sex hormones were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Protein was extracted and determined by ELISA test.  Results:   In prostatic tissues with obesity, the levels of inflammatory mediators were elevated. SRD5A2 promoter methylation was promoted, but SRD5A2 expression was inhibited. Inflammatory mediators and saturated fatty acid synergistically regulated aromatase activity. Obesity promoted an androgenic to estrogenic switch in the prostate.

However, there are no biomarkers available to guide treatment choice for these patients. A recently published phase II clinical trial observed a correlation between ccRCC patients' clustering and their response to targeted therapy. However, the clustering of these groups was not distinct. Here, we analyzed the gene expression profile of 469 ccRCC patients, using featured selection technique, and have developed a refined 66-gene signature for improved sub-classification of patients. Moreover, we have identified a novel comprehensive expression profile to distinguish between migratory stromal and immune cells.

Methods:   This study analyzed a nationwide sample (N = 1903) of cancer survivors (31% Breast; 20% prostate) at nine years (m = 8.9 sd = 0.6) post-diagnosis with a mean age of 64.5 years. Sleep quality and sleep disturbance were assessed by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. Multivariable logistic regression models examined associations between cancer-related problems (physical distress, emotional distress, economic distress, and fear of recurrence) and sleep difficulty (poor vs. low sleep quality and high vs. low sleep disturbance). Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated, adjusting for medico-demographics, behavioral factors, and sleep medication use.  Results:   In sum, 20% percent of the sample reported poor sleep quality, 51% reported high sleep disturbance and 17% reported both. Sleep medication use was reported by 28% of the total sample. All four domains of cancer-related problems were significantly associated with poor sleep quality and high sleep disturbance.

Using the miRNA pull out assay and next generation sequencing, we collected the complete repertoire of miR-28-5p targets, obtaining a data set (miR-28-5p targetome) of 191 mRNAs. Filtering the targetome with TargetScan 7, PITA and RNA22, we found that 61% of the transcripts had miR-28-5p binding sites. To assign a functional value to the captured transcripts, we grouped the miR-28-5p targets into gene families with annotated function and showed that six transcripts belong to the transcription factor category. Among them we selected SREBF2, a gene with an important role in PCa. We validated miR-28-5p/SREBF2 interaction, demonstrating that SREBF2 inhibition affects almost all the tumor processes altered by miR-28-5p re-expression, suggesting that SREBF2 is an important mediator of miR-28-5p TS activity.

Several types of cancer patients suffer from chronic comorbid conditions that are a major clinical challenge for treatment and cancer management. The main objective of this study was to investigate the distribution of the burden of chronic comorbid conditions and associated predictors among cancer patients in Australia over the period of 2007-2017.  Methods:   The study employed a prospective longitudinal design using data from the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia survey. The number of chronic comorbid conditions was measured for each respondent. The longitudinal effect was captured using a fixed-effect negative binomial regression model, which predicted the potential factors that played a significant role in the occurrence of chronic comorbid conditions.  Results:   Sixty-one percent of cancer patients experienced at least one chronic disease over the period, and 21% of patients experienced three or more chronic diseases. Age (>65 years old) (incidence rate ratio, IRR = 1.15; 95% confidence interval, CI: 1.05, 1.40), inadequate levels of physical activity (IRR = 1.25; 95% CI: 1.09, 1.59), patients who suffered from extreme health burden (IRR = 2.30; 95% CI: 1.73, 3.05) or moderate health burden (IRR = 1.90; 95% CI: 1.45, 2.48), and patients living in the poorest households (IRR = 1.21; 95% CI: 1.11, 1.29) were significant predictors associated with a higher risk of chronic comorbid conditions.  Conclusions:   A large number of cancer patients experience an extreme burden of chronic comorbid conditions and the different dimensions of these in cancer survivors have the potential to affect the trajectory of their cancer burden. It is also significant for health care providers, including physical therapists and oncologists, who must manage the unique problems that challenge this population and who should advocate for prevention and evidence-based interventions.""","""['Rashidul Alam Mahumud', 'Khorshed Alam', 'Jeff Dunn', 'Jeff Gow']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['The changing relationship between health burden and work disability of Australian cancer survivors, 2003-2017: evidence from a longitudinal survey.', 'Association of dietary risks, behavioural and lifestyle factors, and the magnitude of disability burden among Australian cancer patients: An observational epidemiology study.', 'Health system costs for individual and comorbid noncommunicable diseases: An analysis of publicly funded health events from New Zealand.', 'Illness burden and physical outcomes associated with collaborative care in patients with comorbid depressive disorder in chronic medical conditions: A systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Health impact, and economic value, of meeting housing quality standards: a retrospective longitudinal data linkage study.', ""The burden of chronic diseases and patients' preference for healthcare services among adult patients suffering from chronic diseases in Bangladesh."", 'Home-built environment interventions and inflammation biomarkers: a systematic review and meta-analysis protocol.', 'Socioeconomic inequalities in the risk factors of noncommunicable diseases (hypertension and diabetes) among Bangladeshi population: Evidence based on population level data analysis.', 'Hypertension and Its Associated Factors Among Cancer Patients at University of Gondar Comprehensive Specialized Hospital, Northwest Ethiopia: Hospital-Based Cross-Sectional Study.', 'Implementing a Health Care Professional-Supported Digital Intervention for Survivors of Cancer in Primary Care: Qualitative Process Evaluation of the Renewed Intervention.']"""

SNHG7 has been found to play the role of oncogene in varieties of cancers, and its dysregulation has been found to be associated with carcinogenesis and progression. In the present study, we examined the expression of SNHG7 in prostate cancer tissues and in paired adjacent normal prostate tissues, and we further explored the clinical significance and prognostic value of SNHG7 in prostate cancer patients.A total of 127 prostate cancer tissues were collected from prostate cancer patients who underwent radical prostatectomy between April 2011 and March 2019 at the department of urology, Pudong New Area People's Hospital. Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction experiment was performed to detect the relative expressions of SNHG7 in the prostate cancer tissues and normal prostate tissues. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to create survival curves and the log-rank test was used to determine statistical significance. A Cox proportional hazard analysis was used to evaluate the prognostic factors in univariate and multivariate analyses.Compared with paired adjacent normal prostatic tissues, SNHG7 expression was increased in prostate cancer tissues (P < .001). Increased SNHG7 expression correlated with Gleason score (P = .021), bone metastasis (P = .013), pelvic lymph node metastasis (P = .008), and TNM stage (P = .007).

However, limited studies focused on exploring the complications of AUR in patients with prostate cancer (PC) who receive androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). Therefore, we aim to evaluate the subsequent risk of AUR in ADT-treated PC patients. We collected data from 24,464 male patients who were newly diagnosed with prostate malignancy from a longitudinal health insurance database of catastrophic illness in 2000 to 2008. All PC patients were categorized into 2 cohorts, namely, ADT cohort and non-ADT cohort, based on whether or not the patient receives ADT. The patients were followed up until the occurrence of AUR. Multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression and Kaplan-Meier analysis were performed. After a 12-year follow-up, the incidence rates of AUR were 12.49 and 9.86 per 1000 person-years in ADT and non-ADT cohorts, respectively. Compared with the non-ADT cohort, the ADT cohort had a 1.21-fold increase in AUR risk based on the adjusted model (95% CI = 1.03-1.43). In addition, PC patients receiving early ADT treatment within 6 months or receiving only luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone treatment also had significantly increased risk of AUR. ADT was positively associated with AUR risk. PC patients receiving ADT should be informed about the risks of bladder outlet obstruction and AUR, and they may benefit from screening for related risk factors. New guidelines and treatments should be proposed in the future to manage ADT-related lower urinary tract symptoms and reduce the risk of AUR.""","""['Teng-Kai Yang', 'Chia-Chang Wu', 'Chao-Hsiang Chang', 'Chih-Hsin Muo', 'Chao-Yuan Huang', 'Chi-Jung Chung']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Medicine (Baltimore)""","""['Association between ischaemic bowel syndromes and androgen deprivation therapy in patients with prostate cancer: a retrospective cohort study.', 'No increased risk of dementia in patients receiving androgen deprivation therapy for prostate cancer: a 5-year follow-up study.', 'Different androgen deprivation therapies might have a differential impact on cognition - An analysis from a population-based study using time-dependent exposure model.', 'Increased risk of a herpes zoster attack in patients receiving androgen deprivation therapy for prostate cancer.', 'Is androgen deprivation therapy associated with cerebral infarction in patients with prostate cancer?

We aimed to estimate the absorbed radiation doses for critical organs (eg, kidneys, parotid glands, submandibular glands, and lacrimal glands) of patients treated with 4 to 6 cycles by Lu-PSMA inhibitor RLT, retrospectively, and to evaluate the findings extensively in order to determine the critical organ radiation-absorbed limitations and the number of prospective RLT.  Materials and methods:   A total of 51 cycles Lu-PSMA inhibitor RLT in 10 patients was analyzed. Therapies have been applied in 4 to 6 cycles with 8 to 10 weeks' intervals. Dosimetric estimates of kidneys, parotid glands, submandibular glands, and lacrimal glands have been calculated based on MIRD scheme pamphlet no. 16. Regions of interest were drawn with GE Xeleris Functional Imaging Workstation. OLINDA/EXM 1.1 simulation software was used to calculate radiation-absorbed doses.  Results:   Mean radiation-absorbed doses were 0.70 ± 0.24 Gy/GBq for kidneys, 1.34 ± 0.78 Gy/GBq for parotid glands, 0.94 ± 0.45 Gy/GBq for submandibular glands, and 2.28 ± 1.29 Gy/GBq for lacrimal glands.  Conclusions:   Due to the critical target organ risks and the optimal therapy doses, patient-specific dosimetry is a deterministic factor in radionuclide therapy. Even when the absorbed kidney doses were above the ICRP critical dose limits in patients who had 4 to 6 cycles of therapy, mortality due to nephrotoxicity has not been observed.

Dexamethasone work differently in blood tumors and solid tumors, and the cause is still obscure. The aims of this study was to identify potential biomarkers associated with the side effects of dexamethasone in different tumors.  Methods:   Gene Expression Omnibus database (GEO) datasets of blood tumors and solid tumors were retrieval to selected microarray data. The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified. Gene ontology (GO) and pathway enrichment analyses, and protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis were performed.  Results:   One hundred and eighty dexamethasone-specific DEGs (92 up and 88 downregulated) were obtained in lymphoma cell samples (named as DEGs-lymph), including APOD, TP53INP1, CLIC3, SERPINA9, and C3orf52. One hundred and four specific DEGs (100 up and 4 downregulated) were identified in prostate cancer cell samples (named as DEGs-prostate), including COL6A2, OSBPL5, OLAH, OGFRL1, and SLC39A14. The significantly enriched GO terms of DEGs-lymph contained cellular amino acid metabolic process and cell cycle. The most significantly enriched pathway of DEGs-lymph was cytosolic tRNA aminoacylation. The DEGs-prostate was enriched in 39 GO terms and two pathways, and the pathways were PPARA activates gene expression Homo sapiens, and insulin resistance. The PPI network of DEGs-lymph gathered into two major clusters, WARS1 and CDC25A were representatives for them, respectively. One cluster was mainly involved in cytosolic tRNA aminoacylation, aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis and the function of amino acid metabolism; another was associated with cell cycle and cell apoptosis. As for the PPI network of DEGs-prostate, HELZ2 was the top nodes involved in the most protein-protein pairs, which was related to the pathway of ""PPARA activates gene expression Homo sapiens.""

As a control, three prostate hyperplasia cases were included. MRI data were analysed, and the following parameters were noted: signal intensity (SI) of prostate lesion on T2-weighted imaging, T1-weighted imaging and DWI, enhancement pattern of prostate lesion, and relative contrast enhancement indices (RCEI) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) value of prostate lesion. For MRI examination, the mean RCEI of the adenocarcinoma was significantly lower than that of hyperplasia (P = .01, r = .8). The SI of the DWI of adenocarcinoma was significantly higher compared to hyperplasia (P = .03, φ = 1). The mean ADC values of the adenocarcinoma were significantly lower than that of hyperplasia (P = .03, r = .82).

TLR4 exhibits both tumor promoting and tumor-suppressing roles and higher TLR9 expression is an important marker of poor prognosis in prostate cancer (PCa). Nobiletin (NOB) is an O-methylated flavonoid and NOB has been proven to have anti-cancer effect in PCa cells. However, there is no study in the literature investigating the potential anti-inflammatory effects of NOB on the TLR signaling pathways in cancer. Therefore, we aimed to explore the potential anti-inflammatory effects of NOB on the TLR4/TRIF/IRF3 and TLR9/IRF7 signaling pathways in different types of PCa cell lines, for the first time.Material and methods: In the current study, the cytotoxic effect of NOB PC-3 (hormone-independent and metastatic) and LNCaP cells (hormone-dependent) was evaluated by WST-1 assay. Furthermore, the inhibitory effects of NOB on TLR4/TRIF/IRF3 and TLR9/IRF7signaling pathway were determined by RT-PCR, western blotting and ELISA analysis.Results: NOB demonstrated an inhibitory effect on PCa cell growth and LNCaP cells were more sensitive to NOB than PC-3 cells due to androjen receptor status. Furthermore, NOB alone could suppress TLR4/TRIF/IRF3 and TLR9/IRF7 signaling pathways through the downregulation of their associated pathways (mRNA and related protein levels) and the release of IFN-α and IFN-β compared to LPS or CpG-ODN stimulated PCa cells.Conclusions: NOB potentially inhibited TLR4 and TL9-dependent signaling pathway in PCa cells.

Forkhead box transcription factor O1 (FOXO1) exerts antitumor effects in various cancers, including PCa. However, the regulatory mechanism of miR-142-3p on FOXO1 expression in human PCa has not been characterized. In this study, we showed that FOXO1 protein levels were downregulated in PCa tissues and cells. Moreover, FOXO1 expression was a predictor of disease-free survival in patients with PCa and was a predictor of prognosis. Increased expression of FOXO1 suppressed cellular proliferation and induced cell cycle arrest at G0/G1 in vitro. However, FOXO1 mRNA and protein levels were inconsistent in human PCa tissues and cell lines. We showed that miR-142-3p levels were negatively correlated with FOXO1 protein levels in PCa. We also showed that miR-142-3p suppressed FOXO1 expression by directly targeting its 3'-untranslated region. Furthermore, suppression of miR-142-3p inhibited cell proliferation and induced cell cycle arrest, and these effects were blocked by FOXO1 knockdown. In vivo experiments showed that miR-142-3p knockout impaired tumor growth.

The objective was to evaluate UGT2B17 protein expression in primary tumours in relation to hormone levels, disease characteristics and cancer evolution.  Methods:   We conducted an analysis of a high-density prostate tumour tissue microarray consisting of 239 localised PCa cases treated by radical prostatectomy (RP). Cox proportional hazard ratio analysis was used to evaluate biochemical recurrence (BCR), and a linear regression model evaluated variations in circulating hormone levels measured by mass spectrometry. The transcriptome of UGT2B17 in PCa was established by using RNA-sequencing data.  Results:   UGT2B17 expression in primary tumours was associated with node-positive disease at RP and linked to circulating levels of 3α-diol-17 glucuronide, a major circulating DHT metabolite produced by the UGT2B17 pathway. UGT2B17 was an independent prognostic factor linked to BCR after RP, and its overexpression was associated with development of metastasis. Finally, we demonstrated that distinctive alternative promoters dictate UGT2B17-dependent androgen catabolism in localised and metastatic PCa.

KDM6A (Lysine (K)-specific demethylase 6A) is a histone modifier frequently mutated in bladder cancer. However, the molecular mechanisms of how KDM6A deficiency contributes to bladder cancer development remains largely unknown. We hypothesized that clarification of the pathogenic mechanisms underlying KDM6A-mutated bladder cancer can help in designing new anticancer therapies.  Experimental design:   We generated mice lacking Kdm6a in the urothelium and crossed them with mice heterozygous for p53, whose mutation/deletion significantly overlaps with the KDM6A mutation in muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC). In addition, BBN (N-butyl-N-(4-hydroxybutyl) nitrosamine), a cigarette smoke-like mutagen, was used as a tumor-promoting agent. Isolated urothelia were subjected to phenotypic, pathologic, molecular, and cellular analyses. The clinical relevance of our findings was further analyzed using genomic and clinical data of patients with MIBC.  Results:   We found that Kdm6a deficiency activated cytokine and chemokine pathways, promoted M2 macrophage polarization, increased cancer stem cells and caused bladder cancer in cooperation with p53 haploinsufficiency. We also found that BBN treatment significantly enhanced the expression of proinflammatory molecules and accelerated disease development. Human bladder cancer samples with decreased KDM6A expression also showed activated proinflammatory pathways. Notably, dual inhibition of IL6 and chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2, upregulated in response to Kdm6a deficiency, efficiently suppressed Kdm6a-deficient bladder cancer cell growth.

Plasma cell-free DNA (cfDNA) sequencing is a minimally-invasive alternative to tissue for profiling the genome in other cancers but relevance in metastatic RCC remains unclear.  Materials and methods:   Whole blood was collected from 55 patients with metastatic RCC. Plasma cfDNA and leukocyte DNA were subjected to targeted sequencing across 981 cancer genes. Matched tumor tissue from 14 patients was analyzed.  Results:   Thirty-three percent of patients had evidence for RCC-derived circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA), significantly lower than patients with metastatic prostate or bladder cancer analyzed using the same approach. Among ctDNA-positive patients, ctDNA fraction averaged only 3.9% and showed no strong association with clinical variables. In these patients, the most commonly mutated genes were VHL, BAP1, and PBRM1, and matched tissue concordance was 77%. Evidence of somatic expansions unrelated to RCC, such as clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential, were detected in 43% of patients. Pathogenic germline mutations in DNA repair genes were detected in 11% of patients. CtDNA-positive patients had shorter overall survival and progression-free survival on first-line therapy. Patients with evidence of clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential had an intermediate prognosis compared with ctDNA-positive and -negative patients.  Conclusions:   CfDNA sequencing enables straightforward characterization of the somatic RCC genome in a minority of patients with metastatic RCC.

Therefore, it is important to study psychosocial factors associated with screening intention in African American men. Guided by social cognitive theory, the current study aims to examine the role of self-efficacy and importance of participation reasons as predictors of PCa screening intention in African American men.Design: This is a primary analysis using data collected from African American men in northeast Ohio and the Southeastern United States. PCa screening intention and self-efficacy were measured by single-item questions. Importance of participation reasons was measured in four domains: psychological, convenience, awareness, and medical. Hierarchical binary logistic regression was used to predict PCa screening intention in African American men.Results: The sample size was 174. The average age was 46.52. Adding self-efficacy and reasons for participation significantly improved prediction for PCa screening intention in African American men (Δχ2 = 55.28, p < .001). The final model had χ2 = 69.63 (p < .001). Higher self-efficacy (OR = 2.56, p < .05), more perceived importance of psychological reasons (OR = 2.42, p < .001) and medical reasons (OR = 1.10, p < .05) were significant predictors. Also, the perceived chance of developing PCa predicted higher odds of PCa screening intention.Conclusions: Enhancing self-efficacy might be an important intervention focus for African American men to improve PCa screening intention. In addition, the findings suggest that African American men intend to have PCa screening because they experience worries or physical symptoms, and unlikely because it is convenient to get screening or recommended by family members and friends. Thus, intervention efforts could focus on enhancing PCa knowledge and informed decision-making about PCa screening among African American men.""","""['Weidi Qin', 'Tyrone C Hamler', 'David B Miller']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Ethn Health""","""['Evaluation of a Computer-Based Decision Aid for Promoting Informed Prostate Cancer Screening Decisions Among African American Men: iDecide.', 'Prostate cancer screening in Black men: Screening intention, knowledge, attitudes, and reasons for participation.', 'Physician Consultations, Prostate Cancer Knowledge, and PSA Screening of African American Men in the Era of Shared Decision-Making.', 'Enhancing public awareness and practice of prostate cancer screening among African men: A scoping review.', 'Social ecological predictors of prostate-specific antigen blood test and digital rectal examination in black American men.']"""

We used the ASCO Value Framework (AVF) and European Society of Medical Oncology (ESMO) Magnitude of Clinical Benefit Scale (MCBS) to quantify and compare the incremental clinical benefit and costs of these agents in the metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) and metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer (mCSPC) settings.  Methods:   We searched PubMed for randomized phase III trials of abiraterone and enzalutamide in mCRPC and mCSPC. Incremental clinical benefit was quantified using the AVF and ESMO-MCBS by 2 independent assessors. Incremental drug costs were calculated using average wholesale prices (AWPs) from the RED BOOK Online.  Results:   In mCRPC, 2 abiraterone trials (COU-AA-301 and COU-AA-302) and 2 enzalutamide trials (AFFIRM and PREVAIL) met search criteria. AVF scores ranged from 46.3 to 66.6, suggesting clinical benefit; ESMO-MCBS scores ranged from 3 to 5, with lower clinical benefit in the mCRPC predocetaxel setting. The overall incremental AWP ranged from $83,460.94 to $205,128.85. In mCSPC, 4 trials met criteria (LATITUDE, STAMPEDE, ENZAMET, and ARCHES; AVF scores were 79.8, 33.3, 59, and 17, respectively). All of the studies showed benefit except ARCHES. By ESMO-MCBS, both LATITUDE and STAMPEDE showed benefit (score for 4 for both studies); ENZAMET and ARCHES were not evaluable. The overall cost of treatment was significantly higher in the mCSPC setting.  Conclusion:   The AVF and ESMO-MCBS frameworks generated slightly different results but suggested that abiraterone and enzalutamide show clinical benefit in both mCRPC and mCSPC but trended to lower clinical benefit and increased costs in earlier disease stages.

Abiraterone, derived from the prodrug abiraterone acetate (AA), inhibits the activity of cytochrome P450 17-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase (CYP17A1), the enzyme required for all androgen biosynthesis. AA treatment effectively lowers testosterone and androstenedione in 21OHD and CRPC patients. The 11-oxygenated androgens are major adrenal-derived androgens, yet little is known regarding the effects of AA administration on 11-oxygenated androgens.  Objective:   To test the hypothesis that AA therapy decreases 11-oxygenated androgens.  Design:   Samples were obtained from 21OHD or CRPC participants in AA or AA plus prednisone (AAP)-treatment studies, respectively.  Methods:   We employed liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) to measure the 11-oxygenated androgens, 11β-hydroxyandrostenedione, 11-ketoandrostenedione, 11β-hydroxytestosterone, and 11-ketotestosterone, in plasma or serum samples from six 21OHD and six CRPC patients before and after treatment with AA or AAP, respectively.  Results:   In CRPC patients, administration of AAP (1000 mg/day AA with prednisone and medical castration) lowered all four 11-oxygenated androgens to below the lower limits of quantitation (<0.1-0.3 nmol/L), equivalent to 64-94% reductions from baseline. In 21OHD patients, administration of AA (100-250 mg/day for 6 days) reduced all 11-oxygenated androgens by on average 56-77% from baseline.  Conclusions:   We conclude that AA and AAP therapies markedly reduce the production of the adrenal-derived 11-oxygenated androgens, both in patients with high (21OHD) or normal (CRPC) 11-oxygenated androgens at baseline, respectively. Reduction of 11-oxygenated androgens is an important aspect of AA and AAP pharmacology.""","""['Connor Wright', ""Patrick O'Day"", 'Mohammed Alyamani', 'Nima Sharifi', 'Richard J Auchus']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Eur J Endocrinol""","""['Abiraterone acetate to lower androgens in women with classic 21-hydroxylase deficiency.', 'Adrenal-derived 11-oxygenated 19-carbon steroids are the dominant androgens in classic 21-hydroxylase deficiency.', 'Androgen dynamics and serum PSA in patients treated with abiraterone acetate.', 'Back where it belongs: 11β-hydroxyandrostenedione compels the re-assessment of C11-oxy androgens in steroidogenesis.', 'The clinical and biochemical significance of 11-oxygenated androgens in human health and disease.', 'Regulatory genes in the androgen production, uptake and conversion (APUC) pathway in advanced prostate cancer.', 'The role of 11-oxygenated androgens in prostate cancer.', 'Testosterone histories from tusks reveal woolly mammoth musth episodes.', 'β-Catenin-Driven Differentiation Is a Tissue-Specific Epigenetic Vulnerability in Adrenal Cancer.', 'Monitoring treatment in pediatric patients with 21-hydroxylase deficiency.']"""

In response to such shortcomings, the updated version 2.1 was introduced, which incorporated diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) into category 2 and clarified lexicons.  Purpose:   To compare the diagnostic performance for the detection of clinically significant TZ prostate cancers (csPCa) and interreader agreement between PI-RADS v2.1 and v2.  Study type:   Retrospective study.  Population:   In all, 142 patients, 201 TZ lesions.  Field strength/sequence:   3.0T; T2 -weighted image and DWI.  Assessment:   Lesions were scored by three independent readers using PI-RADS v2 and v2.1.  Statistical tests:   The sensitivity and specificity at category ≥3 were compared between v2 and v2.1 using the generalized estimating equation model. Detection rates for csPCa of upgraded and downgraded lesions in the use of PI-RADS v2.1 from v2 were assessed. Interreader agreement was assessed using κ statistics.  Results:   PI-RADS v2.1 showed a higher sensitivity and specificity (94.5% and 60.9%) than v2 (91.8% and 56.3%) for category ≥3 lesions in the detection of csPCa, although not significantly. Of eight upgraded lesions from category 2 to 3 (2 + 1) with an incorporated DWI, 50% (4/8) were csPCa. This was significantly higher than category 2 lesions (4.4%; P = 0.003). No csPCa was detected among the 22.8% (46/201) downgraded lesions. There was a moderate interreader agreement for scores ≥3 (κ = 0.565) in v2.1, which was slightly higher than that for v2 (κ = 0.534), although not significantly.  Data conclusion:   PI-RADS v2.1 provides moderate and comparable interreader agreement at category ≥3 than v2 in the TZ lesions.

Integrin β4, a member of the integrin family, has been reported to be positively expressed in vascular endothelia, peripheral nerves, and a collection of epithelia. However, little is known about the effectiveness of β4 immunostaining on the recognition of LVI and PNI. Herein, we explored the applicability of β4 immunostaining in stomach, thyroid, and breast cancers. Parallel immunostaining of D2-40, CD34, and S-100 was performed as controls for lymphatic endothelia, vascular endothelia, and neural fibers, respectively. The results demonstrated that β4 concurrently stained the lymphatic and vascular endothelia, and the peripheral nerves. Both LVI and PNI were clearly and accurately outlined by β4 immunostaining. β4 was also expressed in the majority of tumor cells, enabling recognition of LVI and PNI encroached by small tumor clusters. In contrast to D2-40 and CD34, β4 staining was not observed in stromal cells, and therefore it facilitated differentiation between the shrinkage cleft and LVI. According to our results, β4 staining strikingly increased the diagnostic accuracy and interobserver concordance for LVI and PNI compared with hematoxylin and eosin staining alone. Finally, the applicability of β4 was confirmed in 9 other types of malignancies, including cancers of the colon, prostate, esophagus, lung, kidney, uterus, tongue, bladder, and liver. Collectively, β4 is a reliable marker for synchronous detection and diagnosis of LVI and PNI.""","""['Jian Li', 'Yi Jiang', 'Cuimin Chen', 'Weiwei Tan', 'Ping Li', 'Gang Chen', 'Quanzhou Peng', 'Weihua Yin']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Am J Surg Pathol""","""['Tumor cell invasion in blood vessels assessed by immunohistochemistry is related to decreased survival in patients with bladder cancer treated with radical cystectomy.', 'Prognostic Implication of Lymphovascular Invasion Detected by Double Immunostaining for D2-40 and MITF1 in Primary Cutaneous Melanoma.', 'S100 Staining Adds to the Prognostic Significance of the Combination of Perineural Invasion and Lymphovascular Invasion in Colorectal Cancer.', 'The relationship of lymphatic vessel density, lymphovascular invasion, and lymph node metastasis in breast cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Evaluation of nerves in Mohs micrographic surgery: histologic mimickers of perineural invasion and nervous tissue on frozen section.', 'Ultrasound radiomics-based nomogram to predict lymphovascular invasion in invasive breast cancer: a multicenter, retrospective study.', 'Preoperative red cell distribution width is associated with postoperative lymphovascular invasion in prostate cancer patients treated with radical prostatectomy: A retrospective study.', 'Multi-slice spiral computed tomography in differential diagnosis of gastric stromal tumors and benign gastric polyps, and gastric stromal tumor risk stratification assessment.', 'Proteomic Analysis Reveals Molecular Differences in the Development of Gastric Cancer.', 'Proteomic analysis of coarse and fine skin tissues of Liaoning cashmere goat.']"""

Spleen tyrosine kinase has emerged as a new molecular target for castration-resistant prostate cancer. This study was done to test the cytotoxicity of the lead nanoformulation of a potent spleen tyrosine kinase inhibitor, C61-LNP, against the human prostatic carcinoma cell line, PC-3. PC-3 cells were treated with various concentrations of C61-LNP either alone or in combination with cisplatin (CDDP) for 24, 48 and 72 hours. The cell viability was evaluated by MTS assay. Cellular expression levels of various regulatory proteins in treated PC-3 cells were evaluated by Western blot analyses. C61-LNP exhibited dose-dependent cytotoxicity against PC-3 cells. C61-LNP, as well as C61-LNP + CDDP treatments, caused pro-apoptotic proteomic changes including an increase in cleaved fragments of caspases-3 and -9 consistent with caspase activation as well as an improvement in the anti-apoptotic Bcl2 and Bax levels. The combination of C61-LNP and CDDP changed in alterations of the cell cycle regulatory proteins p53, p21, p27, cyclin D1 and cyclin E levels. C61-LNP exhibited cytotoxicity against the castration-resistant prostate cancer cell line PC3. It also caused alterations in expression levels of regulatory proteins involved in apoptosis and cell cycle regulation and these effects were not abrogated by the standard chemotherapy drug CDDP.

Single dose treatment has been explored in small cohort studies to date. This paper reports a large patient population with localised prostate cancer treated with single dose HDR brachytherapy delivering 19 Gy providing early outcome data from this approach.  Patients and methods:   Seven centres across the UK collaborated in this national protocol to deliver 19 Gy to the PTV defined by the prostate capsule and a 3 mm expansion with clearly defined planning constraints for the urethra and rectum. Entry criteria allowed all risk groups provided PSA ≤40 µg/L and staging investigations were negative for metastases. The primary end point was biochemical relapse free survival (bRFS) defined using the Phoenix definition. Toxicity was measured using CTCAE v4.0.  Results:   A total of 441 patients were entered with median follow up 26 months (range 2-56). Median age was 73 (range 54-84) and 10% were low risk, 65% intermediate risk and 25% high risk. ADT was received by 37.6% overall and 90% of high risk patients for a median period of 6 months. Three year bRFS was overall 88%: this was 100% in low risk, 86% in intermediate risk and 75% in high risk. Only Gleason score was an independent predictor of bRFS. Relapse in 25 patients was assessed radiologically and occurred in the prostate in 15 of these, 11 of whom had localised prostate relapse only. Acute toxicity was low with no grade 3 or 4 events; there were two cases of late urinary stricture and two grade 3 late rectal events.  Conclusion:   This is the largest cohort of single dose HDR brachytherapy patients treated with a single dose published to date. It shows that with 19 Gy there is 100% bRFS at 3 years in low risk patients but results in intermediate and high risk groups are less encouraging falling to 86% and 75% at 3 years with relapse predominantly in the prostate. Limited by the short follow up period of this study, the long-term outcomes of this single dose HDR approach remains uncertain. It is important to have close ongoing surveillance of this cohort as the data matures.""","""['Hannah Tharmalingam', 'Yatman Tsang', 'Peter Ostler', 'James Wylie', 'Amit Bahl', 'Anna Lydon', 'Imtiaz Ahmed', 'Christine Elwell', 'Ashok R Nikapota', 'Peter J Hoskin;National UK HDR Prostate Brachytherapy Database']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Radiother Oncol""","""['Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) as Predicting Marker for Clinical Outcome and Evaluation of Early Toxicity Rate after High-Dose Rate Brachytherapy (HDR-BT) in Combination with Additional External Beam Radiation Therapy (EBRT) for High Risk Prostate Cancer.', 'Clinical outcomes of patients with localized and locally advanced prostate cancer undergoing high-dose-rate brachytherapy with external-beam radiotherapy at our institute.', 'A Pooled Analysis of Biochemical Failure in Intermediate-risk Prostate Cancer Following Definitive Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy (SBRT) or High-Dose-Rate Brachytherapy (HDR-B) Monotherapy.', 'A single institution analysis of low-dose-rate brachytherapy: 5-year reported survival and late toxicity outcomes.', 'High-dose rate brachytherapy as monotherapy in prostate cancer: A systematic review of its safety and efficacy.', 'Safety and efficacy associated with single-fraction high-dose-rate brachytherapy in localized prostate cancer: a\xa0systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Single-fraction high-dose-rate brachytherapy: a scoping review on outcomes and toxicities for all disease sites.', 'Single fraction of HDR brachytherapy for prostate cancer: Results of the SiFEPI phase II prospective trial.', 'Simultaneous ThermoBrachytherapy: Electromagnetic Simulation Methods for Fast and Accurate Adaptive Treatment Planning.', 'Stereotactic Ablative Brachytherapy: Recent Advances in Optimization of Radiobiological Cancer Therapy.']"""

The aim of this retrospective, multicenter study (MITO RT-01) was to define activity and safety of SBRT in a very large, real-world data set of patients with metastatic, persistent, and recurrent ovarian cancer (MPR-OC).  Materials and methods:   The endpoints of the study were the rate of complete response (CR) to SBRT and the 24-month actuarial local control (LC) rate on ""per-lesion"" basis. The secondary endpoints were acute and late toxicities and the 24-month actuarial late toxicity-free survival. Objective response rate (ORR) included CR and partial response (PR). Clinical benefit (CB) included ORR and stable disease (SD). Toxicity was evaluated by the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) and the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) and Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) scales, according to center policy. Logistic and Cox regression were used for the uni- and multivariate analysis of factors predicting clinical CR and actuarial outcomes.  Results:   CR, PR, and SD were observed in 291 (65.2%), 106 (23.8%), and 33 (7.4%) lesions, giving a rate of CB of 96.4%. Patient aged ≤60 years, planning target volume (PTV) ≤18 cm3 , lymph node disease, and biologically effective dose α/β10 > 70 Gy were associated with higher chance of CR in the multivariate analysis. With a median follow-up of 22 months (range, 3-120), the 24-month actuarial LC rate was 81.9%. Achievement of CR and total dose >25 Gy were associated with better LC rate in the multivariate analysis. Mild toxicity was experienced in 54 (20.7%) patients; of 63 side effects, 48 were grade 1, and 15 were grade 2. The 24-month late toxicity-free survival rate was 95.1%.  Conclusions:   This study confirms the activity and safety of SBRT in patients with MPR-OC and identifies clinical and treatment parameters able to predict CR and LC rate.  Implications for practice:   This study aimed to define activity and safety of stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) in a very large, real life data set of patients with metastatic, persistent, recurrent ovarian cancer (MPR-OC). Patient age <60 years, PTV <18 cm3 , lymph node disease, and biologically effective dose α/β10 >70 Gy were associated with higher chance of complete response (CR). Achievement of CR and total dose >25 Gy were associated with better local control (LC) rate. Mild toxicity was experienced in 20.7% of patients.

Here, we clarified the distinct mechanisms of silver nanoparticles for the regulation of autophagy in prostate cancer PC-3 cells under sublethal exposure. Silver nanoparticle treatment caused lysosome injury, including the decline of lysosomal membrane integrity, decrease of lysosomal quantity, and attenuation of lysosomal protease activity, which resulted in blockage of autophagic flux. In addition, sublethal silver nanoparticle exposure activated AMP-activated protein kinase/mammalian target of rapamycin-dependent signaling pathway to modulate autophagy, which resulted from silver nanoparticles-induced cell hypoxia and energy deficiency. Taken together, the results show that silver nanoparticles could regulate autophagy via lysosome injury and cell hypoxia in PC-3 cells under sublethal dose exposure.

Mice were sacrificed 24 days post-injection. All three intervention groups had reduced tumor size, the most important decrease being observed in CaRT-ET mice. Apoptotic marker cleaved caspase-3 was not modified by ET, but enhanced with RT. Importantly, this increase was the highest when the two strategies were combined. Furthermore, NK1.1 staining and gene expression of natural killer (NK) cell receptors Klrk1 and Il2rβ were not affected by ET alone but were increased with RT, this effect being potentiated when combined with ET.

A histologic-proven benchmarking dataset of 102 case images was built and 22 images were randomly selected for evaluation. Some portion of the training images were strong supervised, annotated pixel by pixel. Using the strong supervised images, a deep learning neural network was trained. The rest of the training images with only weak supervision, which is just the location of the lesion, were fed to the trained network to produce the intermediate pixelwise labels for the weak supervised images. Then, we retrained the neural network on the all training images with the original labels and the intermediate labels and fed the training images to the retrained network to produce the refined labels. Comparing the distance of the center of mass of the refined labels and the intermediate labels to the weak supervision location, the closer one replaced the previous label, which could be considered as the label updates.

The proposed method shows better result with weak and semi-supervised data than the method using only small portion of strong supervised data, although the improvement may not be as much as when the fully strong supervised dataset is used. In terms of mean intersection over union (mIoU), the proposed method reached about 0.6 when the ratio of the strong supervised data was 40%, about 2% decreased performance compared to that of 100% strong supervised case. The proposed method seems to be able to help to alleviate the time-consuming work of radiologists to draw the boundary of the lesions, and to train the neural network on the data that do not have complete annotations.""","""['Seokmin Han', 'Sung Il Hwang', 'Hak Jong Lee']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""J Digit Imaging""","""['Combining weakly and strongly supervised learning improves strong supervision in Gleason pattern classification.', 'Label-driven magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) registration using weakly supervised learning for MRI-guided prostate radiotherapy.', 'Local contrastive loss with pseudo-label based self-training for semi-supervised medical image segmentation.', 'Semi-supervised learning for medical image classification using imbalanced training data.', 'A Survey on Label-Efficient Deep Image Segmentation: Bridging the Gap Between Weak Supervision and Dense Prediction.', 'Combining weakly and strongly supervised learning improves strong supervision in Gleason pattern classification.']"""

Recently, albumin-binding PSMA radioligands with enhanced blood circulation were developed to increase the tumor accumulation of activity. The present study aimed at the design, synthesis and preclinical evaluation of a novel class of PSMA-targeting radioligands equipped with ibuprofen as a weak albumin-binding entity in order to improve the pharmacokinetic properties. Methods: Four novel glutamate-urea-based PSMA ligands were synthesized with ibuprofen, conjugated via variable amino acid-based linker entities. The albumin-binding properties of the 177Lu-labeled PSMA ligands were tested in vitro using mouse and human plasma. Affinity of the radioligands to PSMA and cellular uptake and internalization was investigated using PSMA-positive PC-3 PIP and PSMA-negative PC-3 flu tumor cells. The tissue distribution profile of the radioligands was assessed in biodistribution and imaging studies using PC-3 PIP/flu tumor-bearing nude mice. Results: The PSMA ligands were obtained in moderate yields at high purity (>99%). 177Lu-labeling of the ligands was achieved at up to 100 MBq/nmol with >96% radiochemical purity. In vitro assays confirmed high binding of all radioligands to mouse and human plasma proteins and specific uptake and internalization into PSMA-positive PC-3 PIP tumor cells. Biodistribution studies and SPECT/CT scans revealed high accumulation in PC-3 PIP tumors but negligible uptake in PC-3 flu tumor xenografts as well as rapid clearance of activity from background organs and tissues. 177Lu-Ibu-DAB-PSMA, in which ibuprofen was conjugated via a positively-charged diaminobutyric acid (DAB) entity, showed distinguished tumor uptake and the most favorable tumor-to-blood and tumor-to-kidney ratios. Conclusion: The high accumulation of activity in the tumor and fast clearance from background organs was a common favorable characteristic of PSMA radioligands modified with ibuprofen as albumin-binding entity. 177Lu-Ibu-DAB-PSMA emerged as the most promising candidate; hence, more detailed preclinical investigations with this radioligand are warranted in view of a clinical translation.""","""['Luisa M Deberle', 'Martina Benešová', 'Christoph A Umbricht', 'Francesca Borgna', 'Manuel Büchler', 'Konstantin Zhernosekov', 'Roger Schibli', 'Cristina Müller']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Theranostics""","""['Albumin-Binding PSMA Ligands: Optimization of the Tissue Distribution Profile.', 'Preclinical Development of Novel PSMA-Targeting Radioligands: Modulation of Albumin-Binding Properties To Improve Prostate Cancer Therapy.', 'Albumin-Binding PSMA Radioligands: Impact of Minimal Structural Changes on the Tissue Distribution Profile.', 'Third-line treatment and 177Lu-PSMA radioligand therapy of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer: a systematic review.', 'Efficacy Against Human Prostate Cancer by Prostate-specific Membrane Antigen-specific, Transforming Growth Factor-β Insensitive Genetically Targeted CD8+ T-cells Derived from Patients with Metastatic Castrate-resistant Disease.', 'Targeted Alpha-Particle Therapy: A Review of Current Trials.', 'Development of 177LuLu-LNC1003 for radioligand therapy of prostate cancer with a moderate level of PSMA expression.', 'Synthesis and radiolabelling of PSMA-targeted derivatives containing GYK/MVK cleavable linkers.', 'Prostate specific membrane antigen binding radiopharmaceuticals: Current data and new concepts.', 'Modulating the pharmacokinetic profile of Actinium-225-labeled macropa-derived radioconjugates by dual targeting of PSMA and albumin.']"""

Unfortunately, TKI resistance eventually develops, and the underlying molecular mechanism is not well understood.  Methods:   RCC cell-line with metastatic clear-cell histology (Caki-1), and patient samples were analysed to identify the role of Y-box binding protein 1 (YB-1) and ATP-binding cassette sub-family B member 1 (ABCB-1) in acquired sunitinib-resistance development. Caki-1 was conditioned with increasing sunitinib doses to recapitulate acquired resistance development in clinics. Sunitinib-conditioned and wild-type Caki-1 were subjected to cell viability assay, scratch assay, chicken embryo chorioallantoic membrane engraftment and proteomics analysis. Classical biochemical assays like flow cytometry, immunofluorescent staining, immunohistochemical staining, optical coherence tomography imaging, Western Blot and RT-PCR assays were applied to determine the possible mechanism of sunitinib-resistance development and the effect of drug treatments. Publicly available data was also used to determine the role of YB-1 upregulation in ccRCC and the patients' overall survival.  Results:   We demonstrate that YB-1 and ABCB-1 are upregulated in sunitinib-resistant in vitro, ex vivo, in vivo and patient samples compared to the sensitive samples. This provides evidence to a mechanism of acquired sunitinib-resistance development in mccRCC. Furthermore, our results establish that inhibiting ABCB-1 with elacridar, in addition to sunitinib, has a positive impact on reverting sunitinib-resistance development in in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo models.

We demonstrated that melittin strongly reduced cell viability in both leukaemia cell lines but not in physiological peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PMBCs). Subsequent estimated parameters (mitochondrial membrane potential, Annexin V binding and Caspases 3/7 activity) clearly demonstrated that melittin induced apoptosis in leukaemia cells. This is a very important step for research into the development of new potential anti-leukaemia as well as anticancer therapies.

High-performance identification of cancerous MVs plays a vital role in the early diagnosis of cancer, yet it is still technically challenging. Herein, we report a gold nanoparticle (AuNP)-decorated, dual-aptamer modified reduced graphene oxide (RGO) field-effect transistor (AAP-GFET) nanosensor for the label-free, specific, and sensitive quantification of HepG2 cell-derived MVs (HepG2-MVs). After GFET chips were fabricated, AuNPs were then decorated on the RGO surface. For specific capture and detection of HepG2-MVs, both sulfhydrylated HepG2 cell specific TLS11a aptamer (AptTLS11a) and epithelial cell adhesion molecule aptamer (AptEpCAM) were immobilized on the AuNP surface through an Au-S bond. This developed nanosensor delivered a broad linear dynamic range from 6 × 105 to 6 × 109 particles/mL and achieved a high sensitivity of 84 particles/μL for HepG2-MVs detection. Moreover, this AAP-GFET platform was able to distinguish HepG2-MVs from other liver cancer-related serum proteins (such as AFP and CEA) and MVs derived from human normal cells and other cancer cells of lung, pancreas, and prostate, suggesting its excellent method specificity. Compared with those modified with a single type of aptamer alone (AptTLS11a or AptEpCAM), such an AAP-GFET nanosensor showed greatly enhanced signals, suggesting that the dual-aptamer-based bio-nano interface was uniquely designed and could realize more sensitive quantification of HepG2-MVs.

Methods:   A total of 3094 PCa patients receiving local treatment in 44 PCa centers in Germany were recruited between July 2016 and April 2018. Multilevel regression models were applied to predict five pretherapeutic sr-FS (EPIC-26) scores based on clinical characteristics (standard set suggested by the International Consortium for Health Outcomes Measurement), sociodemographic characteristics, and center characteristics.  Results:   Impaired pretherapeutic sr-FS tended to be associated with lower educational level and poorer disease characteristics-except for ""urinary incontinence"" which was only associated with age. Notably, age was a risk factor (""urinary incontinence,"" ""urinary irritative/obstructive,"" ""sexual"") as well as a protective factor (""hormonal"") for pretherapeutic sr-FS. Pretherapeutic sr-FS varies little across centers.  Conclusions:   Pretherapeutic sr-FS varies by clinical patient characteristics and age as well as by socioeconomic status. The findings point out the benefit of collecting and considering socioeconomic information in addition to clinical and demographic patient characteristics for treatment decision-making and fair comparisons between health-care providers.""","""['Rebecca Roth', 'Sebastian Dieng', 'Alisa Oesterle', 'Günter Feick', 'Günther Carl', 'Andreas Hinkel', 'Thomas Steiner', 'Björn Theodor Kaftan', 'Frank Kunath', 'Boris Hadaschik', 'Simba-Joshua Oostdam', 'Rein Jüri Palisaar', 'Mateusz Koralewski', 'Burkhard Beyer', 'Björn Haben', 'Igor Tsaur', 'Simone Wesselmann', 'Christoph Kowalski']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""World J Urol""","""['Development and Internal Validation of a Web-based Tool to Predict Sexual, Urinary, and Bowel Function Longitudinally After Radiation Therapy, Surgery, or Observation.', 'Quality of life in men living with advanced and localised prostate cancer in the UK: a population-based study.', 'Association Between Radiation Therapy, Surgery, or Observation for Localized Prostate Cancer and Patient-Reported Outcomes After 3 Years.', 'Preoperative assessment of patient candidate to prostate cancer surgery.', 'Sutureless Aortic Valve Replacement for Treatment of Severe Aortic Stenosis: A Single Technology Assessment of Perceval Sutureless Aortic Valve Internet.', 'Patient-reported functional outcome measures and treatment choice for prostate cancer.', 'High Neuroticism Is Related to More Overall Functional Problems and Lower Function Scores in Men Who Had Surgery for Non-Relapsing Prostate Cancer.', 'Mapping disadvantage: identifying inequities in functional outcomes for prostate cancer survivors based on geography.', 'Different Approaches for Case-Mix Adjustment of Patient-Reported Outcomes to Compare Healthcare Providers-Methodological Results of a Systematic Review.', 'Use of psycho-oncological services by prostate cancer patients: A multilevel analysis.']"""

Patients and methods:   We analyzed 55 HRT patients irradiated with the total dose of 60 Gy in 20 fractions delivered over 4 weeks. These patients were compared to a control group of 55 patients who received CRT with a total of <78 Gy in 37-39 fractions delivered over circa 8 weeks. External beam radiation therapy (EBRT) was conducted using daily image-guided (cone beam CT) volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) and a simultaneously integrated boost (SIB) for both groups to protect the rectum. Acute toxicities were evaluated according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v5, whereas chronic toxicities were assessed in accordance with LENT-SOMA. Patient traits were compared by implementing t‑tests and Wilcoxon-Whitney tests for continuous variables, whereas discrete characteristics were evaluated by applying two-tailed Fisher's exact tests. In addition, we calculated average treatment effects (ATE). Thereby, propensity score matching (PSM) based on nearest-neighbor matching considering age, comorbidities, and risk stratification as covariates was applied. The statistical analysis was conducted using Stata 14.2 (StataCorp LLC, TX, USA).  Results:   As confirmed by the descriptive tests, the ATE revealed that the intensity and occurrence of urinary frequency (p = 0.034) and proctitis (p = 0.027) significantly decreased for the HRT group, whereas all other acute toxicities did not differ significantly between the HRT and CRT groups. For late toxicities, neither statistical tests nor ATE estimation showed significant differences. Also, no significant difference was found regarding the decrease in prostate specific antigen (PSA) after a median follow-up of 13 months (range 2-28 months), which indicates biochemical freedom from progression.  Conclusion:   HRT offers several medical and economic advantages and should therefore be considered as a useful alternative to CRT.""","""['Stratos Vassis', 'Beatrice Nöldeke', 'Hans Christiansen', 'Christoph A von Klot', 'Roland Merten']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Strahlenther Onkol""","""['Comparison of acute and late toxicities for three modern high-dose radiation treatment techniques for localized prostate cancer.', 'A Phase II trial of arc-based hypofractionated intensity-modulated radiotherapy in localized prostate cancer.', 'Acute toxicity in high-risk prostate cancer patients treated with androgen suppression and hypofractionated intensity-modulated radiotherapy.', 'Current status of intensity-modulated radiation therapy for prostate cancer: History, clinical results and future directions.', 'Organ-confined prostate cancer: treatment with high doses of radioterapy (intensity modulated radiotherapy).', 'Volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT): a review of clinical outcomes-what is the clinical evidence for the most effective implementation?', 'Moderately Hypofractionated Radiotherapy Without Chemotherapy in Elderly or Frail Patients With Head and Neck Cancer.', 'Moderately Hypofractionated Intensity-modulated Radiotherapy With a Simultaneous Integrated Boost for Locally Advanced Head and Neck Cancer - Do Modern Techniques Fulfil Their Promise?', 'A Ten-year-long Update on Radiation Proctitis Among Prostate Cancer Patients Treated With Curative External Beam Radiotherapy.']"""

This behavior has been reported across cancer types, both in vitro and in vivo, and implicated in multiple processes associated with metastatic aggressiveness including immune evasion, collective dissemination of tumor cells, and emergence of cancer cell subpopulations with stem cell-like properties. However, the ability of a population of cancer cells to generate, maintain, and propagate this heterogeneity has remained a mystifying feature. Here, we used a computational modeling approach to show that epithelial-mesenchymal heterogeneity can emerge from the noise in the partitioning of biomolecules (such as RNAs and proteins) among daughter cells during the division of a cancer cell. Our model captures the experimentally observed temporal changes in the fractions of different phenotypes in a population of murine prostate cancer cells, and describes the hysteresis in the population-level dynamics of epithelial-mesenchymal plasticity. The model is further able to predict how factors known to promote a hybrid epithelial-mesenchymal phenotype can alter the phenotypic composition of a population. Finally, we used the model to probe the implications of phenotypic heterogeneity and plasticity for different therapeutic regimens and found that co-targeting of epithelial and mesenchymal cells is likely to be the most effective strategy for restricting tumor growth. By connecting the dynamics of an intracellular circuit to the phenotypic composition of a population, our study serves as a first step towards understanding the generation and maintenance of non-genetic heterogeneity in a population of cancer cells, and towards the therapeutic targeting of phenotypic heterogeneity and plasticity in cancer cell populations.""","""['Shubham Tripathi', 'Priyanka Chakraborty', 'Herbert Levine', 'Mohit Kumar Jolly']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""PLoS Comput Biol""","""['Epithelial/mesenchymal plasticity: how have quantitative mathematical models helped improve our understanding?', 'Population Dynamics of Epithelial-Mesenchymal Heterogeneity in Cancer Cells.', 'Modeling differentiation-state transitions linked to therapeutic escape in triple-negative breast cancer.', 'Hybrid Epithelial-Mesenchymal Phenotypes Are Controlled by Microenvironmental Factors.', 'Concise Review: Stem Cells and Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition in Cancer: Biological Implications and Therapeutic Targets.', 'Population dynamics of EMT elucidates the timing and distribution of phenotypic intra-tumoral heterogeneity.', 'The epithelial-mesenchymal plasticity landscape: principles of design and mechanisms of regulation.', 'Multiscale Modeling of Spheroid Tumors: Effect of Nutrient Availability on Tumor Evolution.', 'Boolean modeling of mechanosensitive epithelial to mesenchymal transition and its reversal.', 'Biophysical Parameters Can Induce Epithelial-to-Mesenchymal Phenotypic and Genotypic Changes in HT-29 Cells: A Preliminary Study.']"""

In this study, the feasibility of the quantification of prostate cancer aggressiveness using parametric methods assessing [11C]-acetate kinetics was investigated in prostate cancer subjects. The underlying uptake mechanism correlated with [11C]-acetate influx and efflux measured in real-time in vitro in cell culture. Methods: Twenty-one patients with newly diagnosed low-to-moderate risk prostate cancer underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and dynamic [11C]-acetate PET/CT examinations of the pelvis. Parametric images of K1 (extraction × perfusion), k2 (oxidative metabolism) and VT (=K1/k2, anabolic metabolism defined as carbon retention) were constructed using a one-tissue compartment model with an arterial input function derived from pelvic arteries. Regions of interest (ROIs) of the largest cancer lesion in each patient and normal prostate tissue were drawn using information from MRI (T2 and DWI images), biopsy results, and post-surgical histopathology of whole prostate sections (n=7). In vitro kinetics of [11C]-acetate were studied on DU145 and PC3 cell lines using LigandTracer® White equipment for the measurement of the radioactivity uptake in real-time at 37°C. Results: Mean prostate specific antigen (PSA) was 8.33±3.92 ng/mL and median Gleason Sum 6 (range 5-7). K1, VT and standardized uptake values (SUVs) were significantly higher in cancerous prostate tissues compared to normal ones for all patients (p<0.001), while k2 was not (p=0.26). PSA values correlated to early SUVs (r=0.50, p=0.02) and K1 (r=0.48, p=0.03). Early and late SUVs correlated to VT (r>0.76, p<0.001) and K1 (r>0.64, p<0.005). In vitro studies demonstrated higher extraction and retention (p<0.01) of [11C]-acetate in the more aggressive PC3 cells. Conclusion: Parametric images could be used to visualize the [11C]-acetate kinetics of the prostate cancer exhibiting elevated extraction associated with the cancer aggressiveness.

Methods:   Data of patients with prostate cancer who had received hormone therapy were extracted from a nationwide community-based database established by the Japan Study Group for Prostate Cancer. Family history of prostate cancer was available for 13 346 of these patients, who thus comprised the study cohort. Prognostic variables, including progression-free survival, cancer-specific survival and overall survival, were compared between men with familial and men with sporadic prostate cancer.  Results:   A positive family history was identified in 220 patients (1.6%). Patients with a positive family history were younger than those without; however, other clinicopathological characteristics and prognoses were comparable. In subgroup analysis, family history was identified as a possible favorable prognostic factor for overall survival among patients with a prostate-specific antigen level at diagnosis <100 ng/mL and those with low or intermediate Japan Cancer of the Prostate Risk Assessment.

A refinement of the heuristic CT-based SPR prediction using a state-of-the-art Hounsfield look-up table (HLUT) is proposed, which incorporates patient SPR information obtained from dual-energy CT (DECT) in a retrospective patient-cohort analysis.  Material and methods:   SPR datasets of 25 brain-tumor patients, 25 prostate-cancer patients, and three nonsmall cell lung-cancer (NSCLC) patients were calculated from clinical DECT scans with the comprehensively validated DirectSPR approach. Based on the median frequency distribution of voxelwise correlations between CT number and SPR within the irradiated volume, a piecewise linear function was specified (DirectSPR-based adapted HLUT). Differences in dose distribution and proton range were assessed for the nonadapted and adapted HLUT in comparison to the DirectSPR method, which has been shown to be an accurate and reliable SPR estimation method.  Results:   The application of the DirectSPR-based adapted HLUT instead of the nonadapted HLUT reduced the systematic proton range differences from 1.2% (1.1 mm) to -0.1% (0.0 mm) for brain-tumor patients, 1.7% (4.1 mm) to 0.2% (0.5 mm) for prostate-cancer patients, and 2.0% (2.9 mm) to -0.1% (0.0 mm) for NSCLC patients. Due to the large intra- and inter-patient tissue variability, range differences to DirectSPR larger than 1% remained for the adapted HLUT.  Conclusions:   The incorporation of patient-specific correlations between CT number and SPR, derived from a retrospective application of DirectSPR to a broad patient cohort, improves the SPR accuracy of the current state-of-the-art HLUT approach. The DirectSPR-based adapted HLUT has been clinically implemented at the University Proton Therapy Dresden (Dresden, Germany) in 2017. This already facilitates the benefits of an improved DECT-based tissue differentiation within clinical routine without changing the general approach for range prediction (HLUT), and represents a further step toward full integration of the DECT-based DirectSPR method for treatment planning in proton therapy.""","""['Patrick Wohlfahrt', 'Christian Möhler', 'Wolfgang Enghardt', 'Mechthild Krause', 'Daniela Kunath', 'Stefan Menkel', 'Esther G C Troost', 'Steffen Greilich', 'Christian Richter']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Dual-Energy Computed Tomography to Assess Intra- and Inter-Patient Tissue Variability for Proton Treatment Planning of Patients With Brain Tumor.', 'First-In-Human Validation of CT-Based Proton Range Prediction Using Prompt Gamma Imaging in Prostate Cancer Treatments.', 'Evaluation of Stopping-Power Prediction by Dual- and Single-Energy Computed Tomography in an Anthropomorphic Ground-Truth Phantom.', 'Reduction of clinical safety margins in proton therapy enabled by the clinical implementation of dual-energy CT for direct stopping-power prediction.', 'Dual- and multi-energy CT for particle stopping-power estimation: current state, challenges and potential.', 'Consensus guide on CT-based prediction of stopping-power ratio using a Hounsfield look-up table for proton therapy.', 'Validation of a deep learning-based material estimation model for Monte Carlo dose calculation in proton therapy.', 'Dual-Energy Computed Tomography Proton-Dose Calculation with Scripting and Modified Hounsfield Units.', 'Status and innovations in pre-treatment CT imaging for proton therapy.']"""

In contrast, circulating tumor cell (CTC) profiling is noninvasive and repeatable, reflecting the dynamic and systemic nature of advanced disease. To date, transcriptomic profiling of CTCs has not delivered on its full potential, because white blood cells (WBCs) vastly outnumber CTCs. Current profiling strategies either lack cancer sensitivity and specificity or require specialized CTC capture protocols that are not readily scalable to large patient cohorts. Here, we describe a new strategy for rapid CTC enrichment and transcriptomic profiling using commercially available WBC depletion, microfluidic enrichment and RNA sequencing. When applied to blood samples from patients with advanced prostate cancer (PC), transcriptomes from enriched samples cluster with cancer positive controls and previously undetectable prostate-specific transcripts become readily measurable. Gene set enrichment analysis reveals multiple significantly enriched signaling pathways associated with PC, as well as novel pathways that merit further study. This accessible and scalable approach yields cancer-specific transcriptomic data and can be applied repeatedly and noninvasively in large cancer patient cohorts to discover new therapeutic targets in advanced disease.""","""['Gareth J Morrison', 'Alexander T Cunha', 'Nita Jojo', 'Yucheng Xu', 'Yili Xu', 'Eric Kwok', 'Peggy Robinson', 'Tanya Dorff', 'David Quinn', 'John Carpten', 'Zarko Manojlovic', 'Amir Goldkorn']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Int J Cancer""","""['A comparison of isolated circulating tumor cells and tissue biopsies using whole-genome sequencing in prostate cancer.', 'Multigene model for predicting metastatic prostate cancer using circulating tumor cells by microfluidic magnetophoresis.', 'Global gene expression profiling of circulating tumor cells.', 'Development and Application of Liquid Biopsies in Metastatic Prostate Cancer.', 'Liquid biopsy: ready to guide therapy in advanced prostate cancer?', 'Single-Cell RNA Sequencing Uncovers Heterogeneous Circulating Tumor Cell Subsets in Breast Cancer.', 'Multi-Marker Immunofluorescent Staining and PD-L1 Detection on Circulating Tumour Cells from Ovarian Cancer Patients.', 'Comprehensive molecular profiling of UV-induced metastatic melanoma in Nme1/Nme2-deficient mice reveals novel markers of survival in human patients.', 'Longitudinal CTCs gene expression analysis on metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer patients treated with docetaxel reveals new potential prognosis markers.', 'Tracking cancer progression: from circulating tumor cells to metastasis.']"""

Methods:   Ten-year cause-specific and relative survival were estimated for lung, breast, prostate, ovary, oesophagus and colorectal cancers. The cause-specific survival was corrected for misclassification of cause of death. The Pohar-Perme relative survival estimator was modified by (1) correcting for differences in deaths from ischaemic heart disease (IHD) between cancers and general population; or (2) correcting the population hazard for smoking (lung cancer only).  Results:   For all cancers except breast and prostate, relative survival was lower than cause-specific. Correction for published error rates in cause of death gave implausible results. Correction for rates of IHD death gave slightly different relative survival estimates for lung, oesophagus and colorectal cancers. For lung cancer, when the population hazard was inflated for smoking, survival estimates were increased.  Conclusion:   Results agreed with the consensus that relative survival is usually preferable.

Multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to evaluate the ability of mGPS to predict nonorgan confined (NOC) disease and lymph-node involvement (LNI) at RNU. Multivariable Cox-regression models were performed to evaluate the preoperative and postoperative prognostic effect of mGPS on survival outcomes.  Results:   Overall, 2,492 patients were included in the study. Of these, 1,929 (77%), 530 (21%), and 33 (1%) had a mGPS of 0, 1, and 2, respectively. mGPS was associated with characteristics of tumor aggressiveness and independently predicted LNI and NOC at RNU (both P < 0.05). On univariable and multivariable Cox-regression analyses, higher mGPS was independently associated with recurrence-free, cancer-specific, and overall survival, both in a preoperative and in a postoperative setting. The inclusion of mGPS significantly improved the discrimination of a preoperative model for the prediction of oncologic outcomes compared to standard prognosticators.  Conclusions:   We found that mGPS is independently associated with clinicopathologic features and survival outcomes after RNU.

Moreover, applying new commercially available time-of-flight (TOF) block sequential regularized expectation maximization (BSREM)-based reconstruction algorithms could allow for further dose reductions. The purpose of this study was to find the minimal dose of the tracer targeting the prostate specific membrane antigen (68Ga-PSMA-11) for a dedicated 15-min pelvic PET/MR scan that still matches the image quality of a reference 3-min scan at 100% (150 MBq) dose.  Methods:   In this retrospective analysis, 25 patients were included. PET emission datasets were edited to simulate stepwise reductions of injected tracer dose. Reference TOF ordered subset expectation maximum (OSEM) and new TOF BSREM reconstructions were performed and differences in the resulting PET images were visually and quantitatively assessed.  Results:   Visually, TOF BSREM reconstructions with relatively high regularization parameter (β) values are preferred. Quantitatively, however, high β-values result in lower lesion maximum standardized uptake values (SUVmax) compared to the reference. A β-value of 550 was considered the optimal compromise for the lowest possible 10% dose reconstructions, resulting in comparable visual assessment and lesion SUVmax.  Conclusions:   This study indicates that the injected 68Ga-PSMA-11 tracer dose for a standard 3-min PET scan can be reduced to approximately 10% (15 MBq) when the PET acquisition time is matched to the 15-min pelvic MRI protocol, and when reconstructed with TOF BSREM using β = 550.

Also, 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT positivity was correlated with clinical parameters for the assessment of predictive markers. Methods: A prospective monocentric study was conducted on 135 prostate cancer patients with biochemical recurrence and a PSA level of less than 1 ng/mL. All patients had undergone initial prostatectomy, with additional radiation therapy in 19.3% of patients and androgen-deprivation therapy in 7.4%. The patients underwent dynamic acquisitions from the prostate bed (1-8 min after injection), standard whole-body acquisitions (60 min after injection), and limited-bed-position delayed acquisitions (120-150 min after injection). The studies were reviewed by 2 board-certified nuclear medicine specialists, independently. A combination of visual and semiquantitative analyses and correlation with morphologic (e.g., MRI) or clinical follow-up findings was used for the final interpretation of lesions as benign or malignant. 68Ga-prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) PET/CT positivity was also correlated with primary clinical findings. Results: Incorporating the information from all phases, we were able to detect 116 lesions in 49.6% of patients (22 local recurrences, 63 lymph nodes, and 31 distant metastases). The detection rates were 31.8%, 44.9%, and 71.4% for PSA < 0.2 ng/mL, 0.2 ≤ PSA < 0.5, and 0.5 ≤ PSA < 1, respectively. Additional dynamic or delayed phases resulted in better determination of equivocal lesions and a higher diagnostic performance in 25.9% of patients. Stand-alone dynamic and delayed images led to better interpretation of equivocal findings in the prostate bed (31.4%) and in other lesions (lymph node or bone) (20%), respectively. Conclusion:68Ga-PSMA PET/CT showed promise for early detection of recurrent disease in patients with a PSA level of 0.5-1.0 ng/mL. However, it showed limited value in patients with a PSA level of less than 0.5 ng/mL. Multiphasic 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT led to a better determination of equivocal findings. Although dynamic images may provide helpful information for assessment of the prostate bed, delayed acquisitions seem to have a greater impact in clarifying equivocal findings.""","""['Mohsen Beheshti', 'Reyhaneh Manafi-Farid', 'Hans Geinitz', 'Reza Vali', 'Wolfgang Loidl', 'Felix M Mottaghy', 'Werner Langsteger']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""J Nucl Med""","""['More advantages in detecting bone and soft tissue metastases from prostate cancer using 18F-PSMA PET/CT.', '68Ga-Labeled Prostate-specific Membrane Antigen Ligand Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography for Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.', 'Detection Efficacy of Hybrid 68Ga-PSMA Ligand PET/CT in Prostate Cancer Patients with Biochemical Recurrence After Primary Radiation Therapy Defined by Phoenix Criteria.', 'The role of 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT scan in biochemical recurrence after primary treatment for prostate cancer: a systematic review of the literature.', 'The Diagnostic Performance of 18F-PSMA-1007 PET/CT in Prostate Cancer Patients with Early Recurrence after Definitive Therapy with a PSA <10 ng/ml.', 'PSMA PET imaging in the diagnosis and management of prostate cancer.', 'Detection Efficacy of 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT in Biochemical Recurrence of Prostate Cancer with Very Low PSA Levels: A 7-Year, Two-Center ""Real-World"" Experience.', 'Salvage Involved-Field and Extended-Field Radiation Therapy in Positron Emission Tomography-Positive Nodal Recurrent Prostate Cancer: Outcomes and Patterns of Failure.', 'Effectiveness of modified orthopedic robot-assisted percutaneous kyphoplasty in treatment of osteoporotic vertebral compression fracture.', '89ZrZr-PSMA-617 PET/CT in biochemical recurrence of prostate cancer: first clinical experience from a pilot study including biodistribution and dose estimates.']"""

Methods: A single-center feasibility study included 10 patients with high-risk primary prostate cancer (PC). 68Ga-prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) PET/CT scans were performed followed by radical prostatectomy and intraoperative CLI of the excised prostate. In addition to imaging the intact prostate, in the first 2 patients the prostate gland was incised and imaged with CLI to visualize the primary tumor. We compared the tumor margin status on CLI to postoperative histopathology. Measured CLI intensities were determined as tumor-to-background ratio. Results: Tumor cells were successfully detected on the incised prostate CLI images as confirmed by histopathology. Three of 10 men had histopathologically positive surgical margins (PSMs), and 2 of 3 PSMs were accurately detected on CLI. Overall, 25 (72%) of 35 regions of interest proved to visualize a tumor signal according to standard histopathology. The median tumor radiance in these areas was 11,301 photons/s/cm2/sr (range, 3,328-25,428 photons/s/cm2/sr), and median tumor-to-background ratio was 4.2 (range, 2.1-11.6). False-positive signals were seen mainly at the prostate base, with PC cells overlaid by benign tissue. PSMA immunohistochemistry revealed strong PSMA staining of benign gland tissue, which impacts measured activities. Conclusion: This feasibility showed that 68Ga-PSMA CLI is a new intraoperative imaging technique capable of imaging the entire specimen's surface to detect PC tissue at the resection margin. Further optimization of the CLI protocol, or the use of lower-energy imaging tracers such as 18F-PSMA, is required to reduce false-positives.

The high cost and limited availability of PBT have constrained its utilization. This study examined patterns and determinants of PBT use in California.  Study design:   Persons with diagnoses of all cancer types from 2003 to 2016 inclusive who had any type of RT were identified in the California Cancer Registry in this retrospective analysis.  Methods:   Cross-tabulations were performed to summarize the demographic characteristics of the study population, both for individuals who received PBT and for those who received other RT modalities. PBT use patterns over time were assessed. Multivariate logistic regression models assessed the effects of demographics and health insurance type on receipt of PBT.  Results:   Of the 2,499,510 people with a cancer diagnosis during the study period, 578,632 (23%) received some type of RT, and of these, 8609 received PBT (1.5%). PBT was most often used to treat cancers of the prostate (41.3%), breast (14.0%), eye (11.7%), lung (6.1%), and brain (6.0%). PBT use was highest in 2003-2004 and then declined over time. PBT use was significantly associated with being white or male, younger age, higher socioeconomic status, Medicare or dual Medicare-Medicaid insurance, uninsured/self-pay status, and proximity to treatment.  Conclusions:   Significant differences exist in PBT use by demographics and health insurance type. The identified racial and socioeconomic disparities merit further investigation.

While socioeconomic factors drive this disparity, genomic factors may also contribute to differences in the incidence and mortality rates. To compare the prevalence of prostate tumor genomic alterations and transcriptomic profiles by patient genetic ancestry, we evaluated genomic profiles from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) CaP cohort (n = 498). Patient global and local genetic ancestry were estimated by computational algorithms using genotyping data; 414 (83.1%) were EA, 61 (12.2%) were AA, 11 (2.2%) were East Asian Ancestry (EAA), 10 (2.0%) were Native American (NA), and 2 (0.4%) were other ancestry. Genetic ancestry was highly concordant with self-identified race/ethnicity. Subsequent analyses were limited to 61 AA and 414 EA cases. Significant differences were observed by ancestry in the frequency of SPOP mutations (20.3% AA vs. 10.0% EA; p = 5.6×10-03), TMPRSS2-ERG fusions (29.3% AA vs. 39.6% EA; p = 4.4×10-02), and PTEN deletions/losses (11.5% AA vs. 30.2% EA; p = 3.5×10-03). Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between AAs and EAs showed significant enrichment for prostate eQTL target genes (p = 8.09×10-48). Enrichment of highly expressed DEGs for immune-related pathways was observed in AAs, and for PTEN/PI3K signaling in EAs. Nearly one-third of DEGs (31.3%) were long non-coding RNAs (DE-lncRNAs). The proportion of DE-lncRNAs with higher expression in AAs greatly exceeded that with lower expression in AAs (p = 1.2×10-125). Both ChIP-seq and RNA-seq data suggested a stronger regulatory role for AR signaling pathways in DE-lncRNAs vs. non-DE-lncRNAs. CaP-related oncogenic lncRNAs, such as PVT1, PCAT1 and PCAT10/CTBP1-AS, were found to be more highly expressed in AAs.

Methods:   Twenty prostate cancer patients treated with IMRT/VMAT were selected for analysis. A total of 453 fractions across those patients were analyzed. Image data were imported into MIM (MIM Software, Inc., Cleveland, OH) and three DIR algorithms (DIR Profile, normalized intensity-based (NIB) and shadowed NIB DIR algorithms) were applied to deformably register each fraction with the planning CT. Manually drawn contours of bladder and rectum were utilized for comparison against the DIR propagated contours in each fraction. Four metrics were utilized in the evaluation of contour similarity, the Hausdorff Distance (HD), Mean Distance to Agreement (MDA), Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC), and Jaccard indices. A subfactor analysis was performed per modality (CTOR vs. CBCT) and time (fraction). Point estimates and 95% confidence intervals were assessed via a Linear Mixed Effect model for the contour similarity metrics.  Results:   No statistically significant differences were observed between the DIR Profile and NIB algorithms. However, statistically significant differences were observed between the shadowed NIB and NIB algorithms for some of the DIR evaluation metrics. The Hausdorff Distance calculation showed the NIB propagated contours vs. shadowed NIB propagated contours against the manual contours were 14.82 mm vs. 8.34 mm for bladder and 15.87 mm vs. 11 mm for rectum, respectively. Similarly, the Mean Distance to Agreement calculation comparing the NIB propagated contours vs. shadowed NIB propagated contours against the manual contours were 2.43 mm vs. 0.98 mm for bladder and 2.57 mm vs. 1.00 mm for rectum, respectively. The Dice Similarity Coefficients comparing the NIB propagated contours and shadowed NIB propagated contours against the manual contours were 0.844 against 0.936 for bladder and 0.772 against 0.907 for rectum, respectively. The Jaccard indices comparing the NIB propagated contours and shadowed NIB propagated contours against the manual contours were 0.749 against 0.884 for bladder and 0.637 against 0.831 for rectum, respectively. The shadowed NIB DIR, which showed the closest agreement with the manual contours performed significantly better than the DIR Profile in all the comparisons. The OAR with the greatest agreement varied substantially across patients and image guided radiation therapy (IGRT) modality. Intra-patient variability of contour metric evaluation was insignificant across all the DIR algorithms. Statistical significance at α = 0.05 was observed for manual vs. deformably propagated contours for bladder for all the metrics except Hausdorff Distance (P = 0.01 for MDA, P = 0.02 for DSC, P = 0.01 for Jaccard), whereas the corresponding values for rectum were: P = 0.03 for HD, P = 0.01 for MDA, P < 0.01 for DSC, P < 0.01 for Jaccard. The performance of the different metrics varied slightly across the fractions of each patient, which indicates that weekly contour propagation models provide a reasonable approximation of the daily contour propagation models.  Conclusion:   The high variance of Hausdorff Distance across all automated methods for bladder indicates widely variable agreement across fractions for all patients. Lower variance across all modalities, methods, and metrics were observed for rectum. The shadowed NIB propagated contours were substantially more similar to the manual contours than the DIR Profile or NIB contours for both the CTOR and CBCT imaging modalities. The relationship of each algorithm to similarity with manual contours is consistent across all observed metrics and organs. Screening of image guidance for substantial differences in bladder and rectal filling compared with the planning CT reference could aid in identifying fractions for which automated DIR would prove insufficient.""","""['Jacob E Hammers', 'Sara Pirozzi', 'Daniel Lindsay', 'Orit Kaidar-Person', 'Xianming Tan', 'Ronald C Chen', 'Shiva K Das', 'Panayiotis Mavroidis']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""J Appl Clin Med Phys""","""['Comprehensive evaluation of ten deformable image registration algorithms for contour propagation between CT and cone-beam CT images in adaptive head & neck radiotherapy.', 'Evaluation of deformable image registration for contour propagation between CT and cone-beam CT images in adaptive head and neck radiotherapy.', 'Deformable image registration for contour propagation from CT to cone-beam CT scans in radiotherapy of prostate cancer.', 'Image registration, contour propagation and dose accumulation of external beam and brachytherapy in gynecological radiotherapy.', 'Image-guided Adaptive Radiotherapy for Bladder Cancer.']"""

Insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor inhibition might mitigate the feedback inhibition by Torc1 inhibitors, suppressing downstream Akt activation and, thus, potentiating the antitumor activity of mTOR inhibition.  Patients and methods:   In the present phase I study, patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer received 6 mg/kg cixutumumab and 25 mg temsirolimus intravenously each week. The primary objective was safety and tolerability. Temsirolimus was decreased if ≥ 2 dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) were observed in 6 patients. The correlative analyses included measurement of circulating tumor cells, [18F]-fluoro-2-deoxyglucose positron emission tomography, 16β-[18F]-fluoro-α-dihydrotestosterone positron emission tomography, and tumor biopsy.  Results:   A total of 16 patients were enrolled across 3 cohorts (1, -1, -2). Two DLTs (grade 3 oral mucositis) were observed in cohort 1 (temsirolimus, 25 mg), and 1 DLT (grade 3 lipase) in cohort -1 (temsirolimus, 20 mg). The most common adverse events included hyperglycemia (100%; 31% grade 3), oral mucositis (63%; 19% grade 3), and diarrhea (44%; 0 grade 3). Low-grade pneumonitis occurred in 7 of 11 patients (44%; 0 grade 3), prompting the opening of a 3-weekly cohort (temsirolimus, 20 mg/kg), without pneumonitis events. No patient had a >50% decline in prostate-specific antigen from baseline. The best radiographic response was stable disease, with median study duration of 22 weeks (range, 7-63 weeks).  Conclusions:   Despite a strong scientific rationale for the combination, temsirolimus plus cixutumumab demonstrated limited antitumor activity and a greater than expected incidence of toxicity, including low-grade pneumonitis and hyperglycemia.

Using electronic health record data from the Flatiron Health database, we studied real-world treatment patterns and health outcomes in patients with mCRPC.  Patients and methods:   We conducted a retrospective, non-interventional cohort analysis of electronic health record data of patients with confirmed mCRPC between January 2013 and September 2017. The primary objective was to describe real-world treatment patterns, including treatment type, duration, and sequencing. Secondary objectives included describing patient characteristics and clinical outcomes.  Results:   Of 2559 patients with mCRPC, 1980 (77%) received at least 1 line of life-prolonging therapy (abiraterone, enzalutamide, docetaxel, cabazitaxel, sipuleucel-T, or radium-223). Of patients receiving first-line therapy, 49% received second-line therapy, and of these, 43% received third-line therapy. Abiraterone/prednisone and enzalutamide accounted for 65% of first-line therapies and 54% of second-line therapies. Docetaxel was the most common third-line therapy (24%). Back-to-back use of abiraterone/prednisone and enzalutamide was common. Radium-223 monotherapy use was 2% in the first-line setting, 3% in the second-line setting, and 8% in the third-line setting. The median overall survival was longer in patients who received life-prolonging therapies (23.7 months; 95% confidence interval: 22.3-25.1 months) than in those who did not (10.1 months; 95% confidence interval: 9.1-11.5 months).

Metabolic, hormonal and immunologic effects of deep AR suppression are unknown. We hypothesized that enzalutamide and apalutamide suppress 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase-2 (11β-HSD2), which normally converts cortisol to cortisone, leading to elevated cortisol concentrations, increased ratio of active to inactive glucocorticoids and possibly suboptimal response to immunotherapy. On-treatment glucocorticoid changes might serve as an indicator of active glucocorticoid exposure and resultant adverse consequences.  Patients and methods:   Human kidney tissues were stained for AR and 11β-HSD2 expression. Patients in three trials [neoadjuvant apalutamide plus leuprolide, enzalutamide ± PROSTVAC (recombinant poxvirus prostate-specific antigen vaccine) for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) and enzalutamide ± PROSTVAC for non-metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer] were analyzed for cortisol and its metabolites using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Progression-free survival was determined in the metastatic CRPC study of enzalutamide ± PROSTVAC for those with glucocorticoid changes above and below the median.  Results:   Concurrent AR and 11β-HSD2 expression occurs only in the kidneys of men. A statistically significant rise in cortisol concentration, cortisol/cortisone ratio and tetrahydrocortisol/tetrahydrocortisone ratio with AR antagonist treatment occurred uniformly across all three trials. In the trial of enzalutamide ± PROSTVAC for metastatic CRPC, high cortisol/cortisone ratio in the enzalutamide arm was associated with significantly improved progression-free survival. However, in the enzalutamide + PROSTVAC arm, the opposite trend was observed.

However, the biological function underlying the effect of lncRNA TUG1 in PCa remains unclear.  Methods:   Reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and Western blotting analysis were used to assess the mRNA expression of TUG1 and protein expression levels of Nrf2 pathway members, respectively. The migration, invasion, and proliferation abilities of cells were assessed by the wound-healing, Transwell migration/invasion, and CCK8 assays, respectively.  Results:   TUG1 was strikingly upregulated in PCa cells compared with non-tumorigenic human prostate epithelial cells. The LncTar Web Server, which is a bioinformatics tool, was used to predict the target association between TUG1 and Nrf2. Moreover, the expression of TUG1 showed a strikingly positive correlation with that of Nrf2 in TCGA PCa RNA-Seq data (r = 0.26,P = 4.63E-09). Subsequently, inhibition of TUG1 using siRNA resulted in deceased proliferation, migration, and invasion of PCa cells; however, these effects were reversed by treatment with oltipraz (an activator of Nrf2). Finally, we evaluated the Nrf2 pathway to reveal the underlying mechanism of TUG1 in PCa cells, and found that TUG1 knockdown decreased the protein expression of Nrf2 downstream members (e.g., HO-1, FTH1, and NQO1).

Methods:   We studied 231 patients (164 men) with pancreatic (N.=36), lung (N.=136), ovarian (N.=32) or prostate (N.=27) cancer receiving first line (N.=192, 83.1%) or adjuvant chemotherapy, followed-up for 3-6 months.  Results:   Some 17 patients were diagnosed with VTE, either asymptomatic detected on leg ultrasound (N.=7) or symptomatic (N.=10). The total frequency of VTE was 10.3% (17/165 with follow-up). Pancreatic cancer had the highest frequency of VTE (4/25, 16%) followed by ovarian (3/26, 11.5%) and lung cancer (10/94, 10.6%). There was no statistically significant difference in VTE rates among cancer types (P=0.36). VTE occurred more frequently in the presence of metastases (13/85, 15.3% vs. 4/80, 5.0%, for the remainder, P=0.03, OR 3.4).

Disease volume was a better fit to survival data than risk group (AIC 878.3 vs. 889.2). Compared to patients achieving undetectable PSA at 28 weeks, inferior survival was observed in patients whose PSA was >0.2 to ≤4.0 ng/mL (HR 3.72 [1.99-6.95]; p < 0.0001) or >4.0 ng/mL (HR 7.13 [4.24-11.9]; p < 0.0001).  Conclusions:   In new metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer, addition of cixutumumab to androgen deprivation did not improve survival. Baseline risk and disease volume carried prognostic value for this distinct trial population, although disease volume added more prognostic information. PSA treatment response was a strong intermediate endpoint for survival.""","""['Risa L Wong', 'Mai T Duong', 'Catherine M Tangen', 'Neeraj Agarwal', 'Heather H Cheng', 'Nicholas J Vogelzang', 'Maha Hussain', 'Ian M Thompson Jr', 'David I Quinn', 'Evan Y Yu']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Prostate Cancer Prostatic Dis""","""['SWOG S0925: A Randomized Phase II Study of Androgen Deprivation Combined With Cixutumumab Versus Androgen Deprivation Alone in Patients With New Metastatic Hormone-Sensitive Prostate Cancer.', 'Seven-Month Prostate-Specific Antigen Is Prognostic in Metastatic Hormone-Sensitive Prostate Cancer Treated With Androgen Deprivation With or Without Docetaxel.', 'Impact of Prior Local Treatment on the Outcomes of Metastatic Hormone-Sensitive Prostate Cancer: Secondary Analysis of a Randomized Controlled Trial.', 'EAU guidelines on prostate cancer.

A patient was diagnosed with a large semi-contiguous tumor by imaging, histologically composed of a large Gleason score 9 tumor with an adjacent Gleason score 7 nodule. DNA sequencing demonstrates these are two independent tumors, as only the Gleason 9 tumor harbors single-copy losses of PTEN and TP53. The PTEN/TP53-deficient tumor demonstrates treatment resistance, selecting for subclones with mutations to the remaining copies of PTEN and TP53, while the Gleason 7 PTEN-intact tumor is almost entirely ablated.

Unfortunately, most men develop resistance and relapse; signaling via insulin-like growth factor (IGF) has been implicated in castration-resistant prostate cancer. We evaluated the antitumor activity of xentuzumab (IGF ligand-neutralizing antibody), alone and in combination with enzalutamide, in prostate cancer cell lines (VCaP, DuCaP, MDA PCa 2b, LNCaP, and PC-3) using established in vitro assays, and in vivo, using LuCaP 96CR, a prostate cancer patient-derived xenograft (PDX) model. Xentuzumab + enzalutamide reduced the viability of phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN)-expressing VCaP, DuCaP, and MDA PCa 2b cells more than either single agent, and increased antiproliferative activity and apoptosis induction in VCaP. Xentuzumab or xentuzumab + enzalutamide inhibited IGF type 1 receptor and AKT serine/threonine kinase (AKT) phosphorylation in VCaP, DuCaP, and MDA PCa 2b cells; xentuzumab had no effect on AKT phosphorylation and proliferation in PTEN-null LNCaP or PC-3 cells. Knockdown of PTEN led to loss of antiproliferative activity of xentuzumab and reduced activity of xentuzumab + enzalutamide in VCaP cells. Xentuzumab + enzalutamide inhibited the growth of castration-resistant LuCaP 96CR PDX with acquired resistance to enzalutamide, and improved survival in vivo The data suggest that xentuzumab + enzalutamide combination therapy may overcome castration resistance and could be effective in patients who are resistant to enzalutamide alone.

Previous studies indicated that prior cancer does not adversely impact clinical outcomes for patients with lung cancer older than 65 years. However, it remains unknown whether these results are applicable to patients with lung cancer aged younger than 65 years old. The study aimed to investigate the impact of prior cancer history on younger patients with lung cancer.  Methods:   We identified younger patients with lung cancer (<65 years) diagnosed between 2004 and 2009 in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database. Propensity score matching was performed to balance differences in baseline characteristics between groups. Kaplan-Meier method and the Cox proportional hazards model were used to evaluate the impact of prior cancer on overall survival (OS).  Results:   Among 103 370 eligible patients with lung cancer, 15.18% had a history of prior cancer. Lung and bronchus (25.83%), breast (14.13%), prostate (8.85%) and cervix uteri (4.74%) were the most common prior cancer types. Of prior cancers, 61.56% are localised and regional stages. More than 67.98% of prior cancers were diagnosed within 5 years of the index lung cancer diagnosis. The median times of diagnosis for prior cancers were 38 months. Patients with prior cancer had the same/non-inferior OS as that of patients without a prior cancer diagnosis (propensity score-adjusted HR=1.01, 95% CI=0.99 to 1.04, p=0.324). Subgroup analyses stratified by timing of prior cancer displayed almost the same tendency (p>0.05). Interestingly, early-stage patients with a history of prior cancer had adverse survival curves (p<0.05). Advanced-stage patients with prior cancer had non-inferior survival (p>0.05).  Conclusions:   A prior cancer diagnosis has a heterogeneous effect on the survival of patients with lung cancer aged <65 years across different stages, but further prospective studies are still warranted.""","""['Jiaqing Liu#', 'Huaqiang Zhou#', 'Yaxiong Zhang#', 'Wenfeng Fang', 'Yunpeng Yang', 'Shaodong Hong', 'Gang Chen', 'Shen Zhao', 'Xi Chen', 'Zhonghan Zhang', 'Wei Xian', 'Jiayi Shen', 'Yan Huang', 'Hongyun Zhao', 'Li Zhang']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""ESMO Open""","""['Effect of prior cancer on survival outcomes for patients with advanced prostate cancer.', 'Impact of prior cancer history on the survival of patients with larynx cancer.', 'Prior cancer does not adversely affect survival in locally advanced lung cancer: A national SEER-medicare analysis.', 'Impact of prior cancer on outcomes in nasopharyngeal carcinoma.', 'FDA analyses of survival in older adults with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer in controlled trials of PD-1/PD-L1 blocking antibodies.', 'Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Survival Among People With Second Primary Cancer in the US.', 'Survival in non-small cell lung cancer patients with versus without prior cancer.', 'Adjuvant chemotherapy may improve long-term outcomes in stage IB non-small cell lung cancer patients with previous malignancies: A propensity score-matched analysis.', 'Effect of prior thyroid cancer on survival of primary liver cancer: a study based on the SEER database.', 'Prior cancer history predicts the worse survival of patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma.']"""

Materials and methods:   Retrospectively, we analyzed 300 patients with elevated prostate-specific antigen (≥ 4.0 ng/mL) and/or abnormal findings in a digital rectal examination at the Korea University Hospital. All 300 men underwent bpMRI-US fusion transperineal FTB and FSB in the period from April 2017 to March 2019.  Results:   PCas were detected in 158 of 300 men (52.7%), and the prevalence of csPCa was 34.0%. CsPCas were detected in 12 of 102 (11.8%) with Prostate Imaging-Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) 3, 42 of 92 (45.7%) with PI-RADS 4, respectively; and 45 of 62 (72.6%) men with PI-RADS 5, respectively. BpMRI showed a sensitivity of 95.1% and negative predictive value of 89.6% for csPCa. FTB detected additional csPCa in 33 men (12.9%) compared to FSB. Compared to FTB, FSB detected additional csPCa in 10 men (3.9%).  Conclusion:   BpMRI-US FTB and FSB improved detection of PCa and csPCa. The accuracy of bi-parametric MRI is comparable with that of multi-parametric MRI. Further, it is rapid, simpler, cheaper, and no side effects of contrast media. Therefore, it is expected that bpMRI-US transperineal FTB and FSB could be a good alternative to conventional US-guided transrectal biopsy, which is the current gold standard.""","""['Tae Il Noh', 'Jong Hyun Tae', 'Hyung Keun Kim', 'Ji Sung Shim', 'Sung Gu Kang', 'Deuk Jae Sung', 'Jun Cheon', 'Jeong Gu Lee', 'Seok Ho Kang']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Cancer Res Treat""","""['A Predictive Model Based on Bi-parametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Clinical Parameters for Clinically Significant Prostate Cancer in the Korean Population.', 'Head-to-head comparison of biparametric versus multiparametric MRI of the prostate before robot-assisted transperineal fusion prostate biopsy.', 'Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and MRI-Transrectal Ultrasound Fusion Biopsy for Index Tumor Detection: Correlation with Radical Prostatectomy Specimen.', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging/Ultrasound Fusion-guided Transperineal Versus Magnetic Resonance Imaging/Ultrasound Fusion-guided Transrectal Prostate Biopsy-A Systematic Review.', 'Magnetic resonance imaging-transrectal ultrasound fusion image-guided prostate biopsy: Current status of the cancer detection and the prospects of tailor-made medicine of the prostate cancer.', 'Detection of intermediate- and high-risk prostate cancer with biparametric magnetic resonance imaging: a systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Diagnostic performance of transperineal prostate targeted biopsy alone according to the PI-RADS score based on bi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging.', 'Comparison between biparametric and multiparametric MRI in predicting muscle invasion by bladder cancer based on the VI-RADS.', 'Three-dimensional ultrasound integrating nomogram and the blood flow image for prostate cancer diagnosis and biopsy: A retrospective study.', 'Concordance between biparametric MRI, transperineal targeted plus systematic MRI-ultrasound fusion prostate biopsy, and radical prostatectomy pathology.']"""

In the current paper we use a conditional Generative Adversarial Network (cGAN) framework called pix2pixHD to create a robust model prone to multicenter data. This study included T2-weighted MR and CT images of 19 patients in treatment position from 3 different sites. The cGAN was trained on 2D transverse slices of 11 patients from 2 different sites. Once trained, the network was used to generate sCT images of 8 patients coming from a third site. The Mean Absolute Errors (MAE) for each patient were evaluated between real and synthetic CTs. A radiotherapy plan was optimized on the sCT series and re-calculated on CTs to assess the dose distribution in terms of voxel-wise dose difference and Dose Volume Histograms (DVH) analysis. It takes on average of [Formula: see text] to generate a complete sCT (88 slices) for a patient on our GPU. The average MAE in HU between the sCT and actual patient CT (within the body contour) is 48.5 ± 6 HU with our method. The maximum dose difference to the target is 1.3%.

Given a patient anatomy and linear-accelerator IMRT multi-leaf-collimator shape or segment, a novel set of physics-based inputs is calculated that encode the linac machine parameters into the underlying anatomy. These inputs are then used to train a deep convolutional network to derive the dose distribution of individual MLC shapes on a given patient anatomy. In this work we demonstrate the proof-of-concept application of DeepDose on 101 prostate patients treated in our clinic with fixed-beam IMRT. The ground-truth data used for training, validation and testing of the prediction were calculated with a state-of-the-art Monte Carlo dose engine at 1% statistical uncertainty per segment. A deep convolution network was trained using the data of 80 patients at the clinically used 3 mm3 grid spacing while 10 patients were used for validation. For another 11 independent test patients, the network was able to accurately estimate the segment doses from the clinical plans of each patient passing the clinical QA when compared with the Monte Carlo calculations, yielding on average 99.9%±0.3% for the forward calculated patient plans at 3%/3 mm gamma tests. Dose prediction using the trained network was very fast at approximately 0.9 seconds for the input generation and 0.6 seconds for single GPU inference per segment and 1 minute per patient in total. The overall performance of this dose calculation framework in terms of both accuracy and inference speed, makes it compelling for online adaptive workflows where fast segment dose calculations are needed.""","""['C Kontaxis', 'G H Bol', 'J J W Lagendijk', 'B W Raaymakers']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Phys Med Biol""","""['DeepDose: a robust deep learning-based dose engine for abdominal tumours in a 1.5 T MRI radiotherapy system.', 'Robust deep learning-based forward dose calculations for VMAT on the 1.5T MR-linac.', 'New capabilities of the Monte Carlo dose engine ARCHER-RT: Clinical validation of the Varian TrueBeam machine for VMAT external beam radiotherapy.', 'The Emergence of Artificial Intelligence within Radiation Oncology Treatment Planning.', 'Uncertainty Assessment for Deep Learning Radiotherapy Applications.', 'Analytical models for external photon beam radiotherapy out-of-field dose calculation: a scoping review.', 'Accurate and Fast Deep Learning Dose Prediction for a Preclinical Microbeam Radiation Therapy Study Using Low-Statistics Monte Carlo Simulations.', 'TrDosePred: A deep learning dose prediction algorithm based on transformers for head and neck cancer radiotherapy.', 'Prediction of dose deposition matrix using voxel features driven machine learning approach.', 'Spot delivery error predictions for intensity modulated proton therapy using robustness analysis with machine learning.']"""

Retrospective studies have suggested an association between the adrenal-permissive allele, the frequency of which is highest in white men, and early development of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC).  Objective:   To examine the association between the adrenal-permissive HSD3B1(1245C) allele and early development of CRPC using prospective data.  Design, setting, and participants:   The E3805 Chemohormonal Therapy vs Androgen Ablation Randomized Trial for Extensive Disease in Prostate Cancer (CHAARTED) was a large, multicenter, phase 3 trial of castration with or without docetaxel treatment in men with newly diagnosed metastatic prostate cancer. From July 28, 2006, through December 31, 2012, 790 patients underwent randomization, of whom 527 had available DNA samples. In this study, the HSD3B1 germline genotype was retrospectively determined in 475 white men treated in E3805 CHAARTED, and clinical outcomes were analyzed by genotype. Data analysis was performed from July 28, 2006, to October 17, 2018.  Interventions:   Men were randomized to castration plus docetaxel, 75 mg/m2, every 3 weeks for 6 cycles or castration alone.  Main outcomes and measures:   Two-year freedom from CRPC and 5-year overall survival, with results stratified by disease volume. Patients were combined across study arms according to genotype to assess the overall outcome associated with genotype. Secondary analyses by treatment arm evaluated whether the docetaxel outcome varied with genotype.  Results:   Of 475 white men with DNA samples, 270 patients (56.8%) inherited the adrenal-permissive genotype (≥1 HSD3B1[1245C] allele). Mean (SD) age was 63 (8.7) years. Freedom from CRPC at 2 years was diminished in men with low-volume disease with the adrenal-permissive vs adrenal-restrictive genotype: 51.0% (95% CI, 40.9%-61.2%) vs 70.5% (95% CI, 60.0%-80.9%) (P = .01). Overall survival at 5 years was also worse in men with low-volume disease with the adrenal-permissive genotype: 57.5% (95% CI, 47.4%-67.7%) vs 70.8% (95% CI, 60.3%-81.3%) (P = .03).

However, it requires a gadolinium contrast agent, with potential risks for patients. The application of DIR-MRI is simple and may allow cancer detection without the use of an intravenous contrast agent by differentially nullifying signal from normal and abnormal prostate tissue, creating contrast between the cancer and background normal prostate. In this pilot study we gathered data from DIR-MRI and DCE-MRI of the prostate for an equivalence trial. We also looked at how the DIR-MRI appearance varies with the aggressiveness of PCa.  Method:   DIR-MRI and DCE-MRI were acquired. The images were assessed by an experienced Consultant Radiologist and a novice reporter (Radiographer). The potential PCa lesions were quantified using a lesion to normal ratio (LNR). Radiological pathological correlation was made to identify the MRI lesions that represented significant PCa. A Wilcoxon sign rank was used to compare DCE-LNR and DIR-LNR for PCa containing lesions. Pearson's correlation was used to look at the relationship between DIR-LNR and PCa grade group (aggressiveness).  Results:   DCE-LNR and DIR-LNR were found to be significantly different (Z = -5.910, p < 0.001). However, a significant correlation was found between PCa grade group and DIR-LNR.  Conclusion:   DIR and DCE sequences are not equivalent and significant cancer is more conspicuous on the DCE sequence. However, DIR-LNR does correlate with PCa aggressiveness.  Implications for practice:   With the correlation of PCa grade group with DIR-LNR this may be a useful sequence in evaluation of the prostate; stratifying the risk of there being clinically significant PCa before biopsy is performed. Furthermore, given that DIR-LNR appears to predict PCa aggressiveness DIR might be used as part of a multiparametric MRI protocol designed to avoid biopsy.""","""['E N Onwuharine', 'A J Clark']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Radiography (Lond)""","""['A direct comparison of contrast-enhanced ultrasound and dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging for prostate cancer detection and prediction of aggressiveness.', 'Feasibility of Dynamic Contrast-Enhanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging Using Low-Dose Gadolinium: Comparative Performance With Standard Dose in Prostate Cancer Diagnosis.', 'DCE-MRI of the prostate using shutter-speed vs. Tofts model for tumor characterization and assessment of aggressiveness.', 'Multiparametric MRI in detection and staging of prostate cancer.', 'Multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging for transition zone prostate cancer: essential findings, limitations, and future directions.', 'Diagnosis and differential diagnosis of dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans: Utility of high-resolution dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) MRI.', 'Injection rate of contrast medium affects diagnostic ability of dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging for endometrial carcinoma: a prospective cohort study.']"""

Methods:   We evaluated 200 consecutive biopsy-naïve or previously negative biopsy men who underwent MRI for clinically suspected prostate cancer (PCa) between May and September 2017. Of them, 132 patients underwent prostate biopsy. Seven radiologists (four dedicated uro-radiologists and three non-dedicated abdominal radiologists) reviewed and scored all MRI examinations according to PI-RADS v2.1. Agreement on index lesion detection was evaluated with Conger's k coefficient, agreement coefficient 1 (AC1), percentage of agreement (PA), and indexes of specific positive and negative agreement. Clinical and radiological features that may influence variability were evaluated.  Results:   Agreement in index lesion detection among all readers was substantial (AC1 0.738; 95% CI 0.695-0.782); dedicated radiologists showed higher agreement compared with non-dedicated readers. Clinical and radiological parameters that positively influenced agreement were PSA density ≥ 0.15 ng/mL/cc, pre-MRI high risk for PCa, positivity threshold of PI-RADS score 4 + 5, PZ lesions, homogeneous signal intensity of the PZ, and subjectively easy interpretation of MRI. Positive specific agreement was significantly higher among dedicated readers, up to 93.4% (95% CI 90.7-95.4) in patients harboring csPCa. Agreement on absence of lesions was excellent for both dedicated and non-dedicated readers (respectively 85.1% [95% CI 78.4-92.3] and 82.0% [95% CI 77.2-90.1]).

The progress of the reaction was monitored with respect to time and negative pressure, with samples being subjected to standard characterization protocols. The resulting polymers were purified using the solvent precipitation method and characterized using various chromatographic and spectroscopic methods including GPC, MALDI-TOF, and NMR. We have observed polymers with a molecular weight of 29 643 Da and 33 996 Da, which is ideal to be used as a drug delivery system. Thus, these polymers were chosen for further modification into folate-functionalized polymeric nanoparticles for the targeted treatment of cancer, in this case we have chosen prostate cancer cells as a model. We hypothesized that due to the 3D structure of the A2B monomer, we expect a pseudo-branched polymer that is globular in shape which will be ideal for drug carrying and delivery. We used a solvent diffusion method for the one-pot formulation of water-dispersable polymeric nanoparticles as well as theraputic drug (doxorubicin) encapsulation. The efficacy of this delivery system was gauged by treating LNCaP cells with the drug-loaded nanoparticles and assessing the results of the treatment.

Methods:   A total of 96,018 American adults were identified from the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial. A ferric-reducing ability of plasma score was used to reflect an individual's TAC intake from diet and/or supplements. Cox regression was used to calculate hazard ratios (HR) for pancreatic cancer incidence, and competing risk regression was used to calculate subdistribution HRs for pancreatic cancer mortality. Restricted cubic spline regression was used to test nonlinearity.  Results:   A total of 393 pancreatic cancer cases and 353 pancreatic cancer-related deaths were documented.

Results:   The sensitivity and specificity of self-reported polyp findings were 88% and 85%, respectively, and for adenoma 11% and 99%, respectively. Among participants with a polyp, older age was associated with lower likelihood while polyp severity and non-white race were associated with increased likelihood of accurate recall. Among participants without a polyp, having multiple colonoscopies was associated with lower likelihood while family history of colorectal cancer was associated with increased likelihood of accurate recall. Among both groups, longer time since colonoscopy was associated with lower likelihood of accurate recall.

Because patient selection is critical to achieve clinical benefit, a noninvasive imaging agent to select TRA+ lesions in patients is needed. Herein, we report the development of the immunopositron emission tomography (immunoPET) radiotracer 89Zr-radiolabeled Bsg and its potential to delineate TRA+ tumors. Bsg was conjugated to the bifunctional chelator desferrioxamine (DFO) and radiolabeled with [89Zr]Zr-oxalate.

A specific activity of 0.18 ± 0.01 GBq/mg (4.8 ± 0.3 mCi/mg) was obtained for [89Zr]Zr-DFO-Bsg. BxPC-3 xenografts exhibited three-fold higher radiotracer uptake compared to [89Zr]Zr-DFO-IgG. Competitive saturation studies using BxPC-3 xenografts further confirmed tracer specificity. The TRA-specific probe had lower accumulation in PC-3 xenografts. Ex vivo autoradiographs correlated with TRA expression from the histopathology of the resected tumor xenografts. Additionally, patient cancer tissues demonstrated positive staining with Bsg with metastatic lesions exhibiting the highest staining.

Current criteria for positive findings on dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) are unclear. We compared the diagnostic performance of mass enhancement on DCE-MRI versus conventional DCE-MRI criteria for identifying clinically significant prostate cancer (csPCa) in the peripheral zone (PZ). MATERIALS AND METHODS. A total of 173 consecutive patients with MRI- and surgically proven prostate cancer (PCa) were evaluated. Two readers independently interpreted DCE-MRI examinations of the PZ. Criteria denoting a positive DCE-MRI examination included conventional criteria from the Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System version 2 (PI-RADSv2) and mass enhancement. The diagnostic performance of and interreader agreement for the two types of enhancement criteria in identifying csPCa in the PZ that met Epstein criteria were investigated. RESULTS. The proportion of csPCa in the PZ was 69.3% (120/173). For both readers, the specificity and positive predictive value of mass enhancement were increased compared with conventional enhancement criteria (specificity, 75.5% vs 5.7% [for reader 1] and 84.9% vs 30.2% [for reader 2], respectively; positive predictive value, 87.1% vs 70.6% [for reader 1] and 91.5% vs 75.3% [for reader 2], respectively). The AUC value of mass enhancement was higher than that of conventional criteria (for reader 1, 0.744 [95% CI, 0.672-0.807] vs 0.528 [95% CI, 0.451-0.605] [p < 0.001], respectively; for reader 2, 0.783 [95% CI, 0.714-0.842] vs 0.602 [95% CI, 0.497-0.700] [p < 0.001], respectively). The weighted kappa value for agreement between the two readers was 0.206 for conventional criteria and 0.613 for mass enhancement. CONCLUSION. PZ lesions with mass enhancement on DCE-MRI are more likely to be csPCa. This enhancement pattern may need to be considered as one of the criteria in PI-RADS.""","""['Sung Yoon Park', 'Byung Kwan Park', 'Ghee Young Kwon']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""AJR Am J Roentgenol""","""['Mass Enhancement Pattern at Prostate MRI as a Potential PI-RADS Criterion.', 'Investigating the role of DCE-MRI, over T2 and DWI, in accurate PI-RADS v2 assessment of clinically significant peripheral zone prostate lesions as defined at radical prostatectomy.', 'Dynamic Contrast-Enhanced MRI-Upgraded Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System Version 2 Category 3 Peripheral Zone Observations Stratified by a Size Threshold of 15 mm.', 'Comparison of Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System versions 1 and 2 for the Detection of Peripheral Zone Gleason Score 3 + 4 = 7 Cancers.', 'PI-RADS version 2: optimal time range for determining positivity of dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI in peripheral zone prostate cancer.', 'Multiparametric MRI in detection and staging of prostate cancer.', 'Mass Enhancement Pattern at Prostate MRI as a Potential PI-RADS Criterion.', 'The role of MRI in prostate cancer: current and future directions.', 'Dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) imaging: state of the art and applications in whole-body imaging.']"""

Herein, we demonstrate a strategy for simultaneous detection of multiple tumor markers in blood by functional liquid crystal (LC) sensors assisted with target-induced dissociation (TID) of an aptamer for the first time. Magnetic beads (MBs) coated with an aptamer (apt1) are employed to specifically capture target proteins in blood. After incubation of the obtained protein-coated MBs with duplexes of another aptamer (apt2) and signal DNA, sandwich complexes of apt1/protein/apt2 are formed on the MBs due to specific recognition of target proteins by apt2, which induces release of signal DNA into the aqueous solution. Subsequently, signal DNA is specifically recognized by highly sensitive DNA-laden LC sensors. Using this strategy, a 3D printed optical cell was employed to enable simultaneous detection of multiple tumor markers such as carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), and prostate specific antigen (PSA) with high specificity and high sensitivity. Overall, this effective and low-cost multiplex approach takes advantage of the easy separation of MBs, high specificity of aptamer-based recognition, and high sensitivity of functional LC sensors. Plus, it offers a performance that is competitive to that of commercial ELISA kits without potential interference from hemolysis, which makes it very promising in multiplex detection of tumor markers in clinical applications.""","""['Lubin Qi', 'Shuya Liu', 'Yifei Jiang', 'Jin-Ming Lin', 'Li Yu', 'Qiongzheng Hu']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Anal Chem""","""['Detection of Biomarkers in Blood Using Liquid Crystals Assisted with Aptamer-Target Recognition Triggered in Situ Rolling Circle Amplification on Magnetic Beads.', 'Microfluidic chip electrophoresis for simultaneous fluorometric aptasensing of alpha-fetoprotein, carbohydrate antigen 125 and carcinoembryonic antigen by applying a\xa0catalytic hairpin assembly.', 'Rolling circle amplification integrated with suspension bead array for ultrasensitive multiplex immunodetection of tumor markers.', 'A Chemiluminescence Sensor for the Detection of α-Fetoprotein and Carcinoembryonic Antigen Based on Dual-Aptamer Functionalized Magnetic Silicon Composite.', 'An aptamer-based four-color fluorometic method for simultaneous determination and imaging of alpha-fetoprotein, vascular endothelial growth factor-165, carcinoembryonic antigen and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 in living cells.', 'Simple and sensitive detection of miRNA-122 based on a micro-biosensor through square wave voltammetry.', 'Improving aptamer performance: key factors and strategies.', 'Recent advances in optical aptasensors for biomarkers in early diagnosis and prognosis monitoring of hepatocellular carcinoma.', 'Liquid crystal-assisted optical biosensor for early-stage diagnosis of mammary glands using HER-2.', 'Combination of multiple nucleic acid aptamers for precision detection of tumors based on optical methods.']"""

These approaches are likely to have differential impacts on cell phenotypes, with implications for experimental outcomes. Therefore, defining and comparing the transcriptional signatures associated with 2D and 3D approaches may be useful for designing experiments and interpreting research results.  Methods:   In this study, LNCaP, VCaP, and 22Rv1 human PC cells were either cultivated in monolayers or as xenografts in NOD SCID mice, and their gene transcription profiles were quantitated and compared using microarray and real-time polymerase chain reaction techniques. Immunohistochemistry was used to evaluate protein expression in cancer cell xenografts.  Results:   Comparisons of gene expression profiles of tumor cells grown in 2D vs 3D environments identified gene sets featuring similar expression patterns in all three cancer cell lines and unique transcriptional signatures associated with 3D vs 2D growth. Pathways related to cell-cell interactions, differentiation, and the extracellular matrix were enriched in 3D conditions. Immunohistochemical analyses confirmed that gene upregulation in xenografts occurred in implanted cancer cells and not in mouse stromal cells. Cultivating cells in vitro in the presence of mouse, rather than bovine serum failed to elicit the gene transcription profile observed in xenografts, further supporting the hypothesis that this profile reflects 3D growth and enhanced microenvironmental interactions, rather than exposure to species-specific serum factors.  Conclusions:   Overall, these findings define the expression profiles observed in PC cells cultivated in 2D monolayers and in 3D xenografts, highlighting differentially regulated pathways in each setting and providing information for interpreting research results in model systems.""","""['Lauren Brady', 'Rui M Gil da Costa', 'Ilsa M Coleman', 'Clinton K Matson', 'Michael C Risk', 'Roger T Coleman', 'Peter S Nelson']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Gene and miRNA expression signature of Lewis lung carcinoma LLC1 cells in extracellular matrix enriched microenvironment.', 'The Volume of Three-Dimensional Cultures of Cancer Cells InVitro Influences Transcriptional Profile Differences and Similarities with Monolayer Cultures and Xenografted Tumors.', 'Transcriptome analysis of differentially expressed genes and pathways associated with mitoxantrone treatment prostate cancer.', 'Influences of the 3D microenvironment on cancer cell behaviour and treatment responsiveness: A recent update on lung, breast and prostate cancer models.', 'Gene expression perturbation in vitro--a growing case for three-dimensional (3D) culture systems.', 'Characterisation of cell lines derived from prostate cancer patients with localised disease.', 'Tumor Organoid and Spheroid Models for Cervical Cancer.', 'Non-destructive monitoring of 3D cell cultures: new technologies and applications.', 'Transcriptomic Analysis of LNCaP Tumor Xenograft to Elucidate the Components and Mechanisms Contributed by Tumor Environment as Targets for Dietary Prostate Cancer Prevention Studies.', 'Validation of a multicellular tumor microenvironment system for modeling patient tumor biology and drug response.']"""

Utilizing a provincial population-based linked data set from an equal-access, universal health care system, we sought to compare outcomes among patients treated with either radiation or prostatectomy for nonmetastatic prostate cancer.  Materials and methods:   We performed a retrospective cohort study by linking several administrative data sets to identify patients who were diagnosed with prostate cancer between 2004 and 2016 in Manitoba, Canada and who were subsequently treated with either RP or RT. Cox proportional hazard models with inverse probability of treatment weighting were used to compare rates of all-cause mortality, as well as prostate cancer specific mortality (PCSM) between patients who underwent RP vs RT.  Results:   During the study period, 2,540 patients underwent RP and 1,895 underwent RT for prostate cancer. Unadjusted overall survival was higher for RP vs RT (5-year overall survival 95.52% for RP compared with 84.55% for RT, p <0.0001). In inverse probability of treatment weighting-adjusted Cox regression analysis, compared to patients in the RP groups, patients in the RT group had an increased rate of all-cause mortality (HR 1.93, 95% CI 1.65-2.26, p <0.0001), and PCSM (HR 3.98, 95% CI 2.89-5.49; p <0.0001).

Studies using prostatectomy specimens have reported a racial difference in tumor location within the prostate, with a greater incidence of transition zone cancer in Asian men compared with Caucasian men. However, there may be potential biases in studies based on surgical specimens. We describe the pathological features of subclinical prostate cancer, such as latent cancer and incidental cancer, to elucidate tumor location of contemporary Japanese patients. We also compare the prevalence of latent and incidental prostate cancer to determine whether the incidence of prostate cancer is higher in patients with bladder cancer.  Materials and methods:   Overall 182 men autopsied and 148 who underwent cystoprostatectomy for bladder cancer were included in the study. Each prostate gland was fixed and sliced in step sections. Histological evaluation was performed by a single genitourinary pathologist. The index tumor location was categorized into transition zone or peripheral zone.  Results:   Prostate cancer was found in 39.0% of the autopsy specimens and 31.6% of the cystoprostatectomy specimens. The prevalence and pathological characteristics were not significantly different between latent and incidental cancer. The prevalence of transition zone cancer was 39.0% (46 of 118). In elderly men peripheral zone cancer was more frequently diagnosed than transition zone cancer (p=0.049). The pathological characteristics of transition and peripheral zone cancers were similar except for the pT stage.  Conclusions:   Transition zone cancer was prevalent in contemporary Japanese men. The incidence of prostate cancer in men with bladder cancer might not be higher than that in healthy men.""","""['Hiroyuki Inaba', 'Takahiro Kimura', 'Hajime Onuma', 'Shun Sato', 'Masahito Kido', 'Toshihiro Yamamoto', 'Yumiko Fukuda', 'Hiroyuki Takahashi', 'Shin Egawa']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""J Urol""","""['Tumor Location and Pathological Features of Latent and Incidental Prostate Cancer in Contemporary Japanese Men.

Materials and methods:   The study included 641 patients who experienced prostate specific antigen rise and nodal recurrence after radical prostatectomy and underwent salvage lymph node dissection. Lymph node recurrence was documented by positron emission tomography/computerized tomography using 11C-choline (407, 63%) or 68Ga-PSMA ligand (234, 37%). The outcome was underestimation of tumor burden (difference between number of positive nodes on final pathology and number of positive spots at positron emission tomography/computerized tomography). Multivariable analysis tested the association between positron emission tomography/computerized tomography tracer (11C-choline vs 68Ga-PSMA) and tumor burden underestimation.  Results:   Overall the extent of tumor burden underestimation was significantly higher in the 11C-choline group compared to the 68Ga-PSMA group (p <0.0001), which was confirmed on multivariable analysis (p=0.028). Repeating these analyses according to prostate specific antigen, tumor burden underestimation was lower with 68Ga-PSMA only when prostate specific antigen was 1.5 ng/ml or less. Conversely, the underestimation of the 2 tracers became similar when prostate specific antigen was greater than 1.5 ng/ml. Furthermore, we evaluated the risk of underestimation by number of positive spots on positron emission tomography/computerized tomography. The higher the number of positive spots the higher the underestimation of tumor burden regardless of the tracer used (p=0.2).  Conclusions:   Positron emission tomography/computerized tomography significantly underestimates the burden of prostate cancer recurrence, regardless of the tracer used. 68Ga-PSMA was associated with a lower rate of underestimation in patients with a prostate specific antigen below 1.5 ng/ml and a limited nodal tumor load.

We previously conducted 2 retrospective studies and found %fPSA 15 or greater in the setting of biochemical recurrence confers more aggressive disease. To validate that finding we used biobank specimens collected prospectively when patients were first diagnosed with biochemical recurrence.  Materials and methods:   Biobank specimens of patients with undetectable prostate specific antigen after radical prostatectomy and subsequent biochemical recurrence (prostate specific antigen 0.1 ng/ml or greater) were analyzed for %fPSA. Patients were stratified according to the %fPSA cutoff of 15. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to predict covariates associated with a higher %fPSA. Cox proportional hazard models were performed to evaluate the prognostic effect of %fPSA on androgen deprivation therapy-free survival, metastasis-free survival, castration resistant-free survival and cancer specific survival.  Results:   A total of 154 men were included in the study, of whom 126 (82%) had %fPSA less than 15 and 28 (18%) had %fPSA 15 or greater. Median followup for %fPSA less than 15 and %fPSA 15 or greater was 75 and 69 months, respectively. Patients with %fPSA 15 or greater had increased hazard of receiving androgen deprivation therapy (43% vs 25%, adjusted HR 2.40, 95% CI 1.12-5.11), metastatic disease (21% vs 7.9%, adjusted HR 4.10, 95% CI 1.11-15.2) and castration resistant prostate cancer (14% vs 4.0%, unadjusted HR 4.14, 95% CI 1.11-15.5) vs %fPSA less than 15, respectively.  Conclusions:   Patients with %fPSA 15 or greater were started on androgen deprivation therapy earlier, and they had progression to castration resistant prostate cancer and metastatic stage earlier. %fPSA 15 or greater in the setting of biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy is an indicator of a more aggressive disease.

The present study, 18F-Fluciclovine PET/CT in biochemicAL reCurrence Of Prostate caNcer (FALCON; NCT02578940), aimed to evaluate the effect of 18F-fluciclovine on management of men with BCR of prostate cancer.  Methods and materials:   Men with a first episode of BCR after curative-intent primary therapy were enrolled at 6 UK sites. Patients underwent 18F-fluciclovine positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) according to standardized procedures. Clinicians documented management plans before and after scanning, recording changes to treatment modality as major and changes within a modality as other. The primary outcome measure was record of a revised management plan postscan. Secondary endpoints were evaluation of optimal prostate specific antigen (PSA) threshold for detection, salvage treatment outcome assessment based on 18F-fluciclovine-involvement, and safety.  Results: 18F-Fluciclovine was well tolerated in the 104 scanned patients (median PSA = 0.79 ng/mL). Lesions were detected in 58 out of 104 (56%) patients. Detection was broadly proportional to PSA level; ≤1 ng/mL, 1 out of 3 of scans were positive, and 93% scans were positive at PSA >2.0 ng/mL. Sixty-six (64%) patients had a postscan management change (80% after a positive result). Major changes (43 out of 66; 65%) were salvage or systemic therapy to watchful waiting (16 out of 66; 24%); salvage therapy to systemic therapy (16 out of 66; 24%); and alternative changes to treatment modality (11 out of 66, 17%). The remaining 23 out of 66 (35%) management changes were modifications of the prescan plan: most (22 out of 66; 33%) were adjustments to planned brachytherapy/radiation therapy to include a 18F-fluciclovine-guided boost. Where 18F-fluciclovine guided salvage therapy, the PSA response rate was higher than when 18F-fluciclovine was not involved (15 out of 17 [88%] vs 28 out of 39 [72%]).  Conclusions: 18F-Fluciclovine PET/CT located recurrence in the majority of men with BCR, frequently resulting in major management plan changes. Incorporating 18F-fluciclovine PET/CT into treatment planning may optimize targeting of recurrence sites and avoid futile salvage therapy.""","""['Andrew F Scarsbrook', 'David Bottomley', 'Eugene J Teoh', 'Kevin M Bradley', 'Heather Payne', 'Asim Afaq', 'Jamshed Bomanji', 'Nicholas van As', 'Sue Chua', 'Peter Hoskin', 'Anthony Chambers', 'Gary J Cook', 'Victoria S Warbey', 'Sai Han', 'Hing Y Leung', 'Albert Chau', 'Matthew P Miller', 'Fergus V Gleeson;FALCON study group']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys""","""['The Impact of Positron Emission Tomography with 18F-Fluciclovine on the Treatment of Biochemical Recurrence of Prostate Cancer: Results from the LOCATE Trial.', 'Prostate cancer recurrence in patients with negative or equivocal conventional imaging: A role for 18F-fluciclovine-PET/CT in delineating sites of recurrence and identifying patients with oligometastatic disease.', 'Impact of 18F-fluciclovine PET/CT on plans for androgen deprivation therapy in patients with biochemical recurrence of prostate cancer: data analysis from two prospective clinical trials.', 'Use and Impact of Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography Prior to Salvage Radiation Therapy in Men with Biochemical Recurrence After Radical Prostatectomy: A Scoping Review.', 'Fluorine-18-Labeled Fluciclovine PET/CT in Primary and Biochemical Recurrent Prostate Cancer Management.', 'Differences in Failure-Free Survival After Salvage Radiotherapy Guided by Conventional Imaging Versus 18F-Fluciclovine PET/CT in Postprostatectomy Patients: A Post Hoc Substratification Analysis of the EMPIRE-1 Trial.', 'The Value of Phenotypic Precision Medicine in Prostate Cancer.', 'Effect of Androgen Deprivation Therapy on the Results of PET/CT with 18F-Fluciclovine in Patients with Metastatic Prostate Cancer.', 'Molecular Imaging Assessment of Androgen Deprivation Therapy in Prostate Cancer.', 'Management Impact of Metachronous Oligometastatic Disease Identified on 18F-Fluciclovine (Axumin™) PET/CT in Biochemically Recurrent Prostate Cancer.']"""

Methods:   This correlative series considered 952 men with prostatic-specific antigen >3 ng/ml and/or abnormal digital rectal examination who were subjected to prostatic biopsy (PB) between 2016 and 2017. Of these men, 768 had no previous 5-α-reductase inhibitor use or history of prostate cancer (CaP) and had previously undergone 3-T multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI). In this sample, 549 men were biopsy-naïve and 219 had at least 1 previous negative PB. A 12-core transrectal ultrasound-guided PB was performed in all participants, as well as at least 2-core targeted biopsies of every detected lesion with a PIRADSv.2 score ≥3. Significant CaP (sCaP) was defined as an International Society of Uropathologist grade >1 or tumor length >4 mm.  Results:   The overall CaP detection was 41.7%, with sCaP detected in 37.4%. sCaP was detected in 4.3% of PIRADSv.2 <3, 21.5% of PIRADSv.2 =3, 56.6% of PIRADSv.2 =4, and 78.5% of PIRADSv.2 =5, (P < 0.001). Insignificant CaP detection ranged from 6.5% to 1.5% respectively (P = 0.099). PSAD was an independent predictor of sCaP (odds ratios 1.971, 95% confidence interval [1.633, 2.378], P <0.001) and mpMRI (OR 3.179, 95%CI [2.593, 4.950], P < 0.001). Age (P = 0.013), family history of CaP (P = 0.021), and the type of PB (initial vs. repeated, P < 0.001) were also independent predictors of sCaP. PSAD was determined by PIRADSv.2 (P = 0.013) and the presence of sCaP (P < 0.001). PSAD increased with PIRADSv.2 score, even in men with CaP (P < 0.001) and slightly in men without CaP (P = 0.019). The area under the curve for mpMRI increased from 0.830 to 0.869 when PSAD was associated, (P < 0.001). The area under the curve of PSAD decreased from 0.727 in men with a PIRADSv.2 score <3 to 0.706 in those with a score of 5.  Conclusions:   The efficacy of PSAD to detect sCaP decreases with PIRADSv.2. Predictors other than mpMRI and PSAD exist. Considering these conditions, independent predictors should be integrated in a nomogram and risk-calculator to personalize PB recommendation.""","""['Juan Morote', 'Anna Celma', 'Fernando Diaz', 'Lucas Regis', 'Sarai Roche', 'Richard Mast', 'María E Semidey', 'Inés M de Torres', 'Jacques Planas', 'Enrique Trilla']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Urol Oncol""","""['The influence of prostate-specific antigen density on positive and negative predictive values of multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging to detect Gleason score 7-10 prostate cancer in a repeat biopsy setting.', 'MRI combined with PSA density in detecting clinically significant prostate cancer in patients with PSA serum levels of 4∼10ng/mL: Biparametric versus multiparametric MRI.', 'The role of prostate-specific antigen density and negative multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging in excluding prostate cancer for biopsy-naïve men: clinical outcomes from a high-volume center in China.', 'What to expect from a non-suspicious prostate MRI?

Results from a statewide collaborative""","""Objectives:   Prostate cancer (CaP) staging traditionally includes computed tomography (CT) and technetium-99m bone scintigraphy (BS) for assessment of lymph node (LN) and bone metastases, respectively. In recent years, multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) has been used in diagnostic assessment of CaP. We sought to compare the accuracy of mpMRI to CT and BS for pretreatment staging.  Materials and methods:   Using the Michigan Urological Surgery Improvement Collaborative registry, we identified men undergoing pretreatment mpMRI in addition to CT and/or BS in 2012 to 2018. Imaging reports were classified as positive, negative, or equivocal for detection of LN and bone metastases. A best value comparator (BVC) was used to adjudicate metastatic status in the absence of pathologic data. mpMRI accuracy was calculated using pessimistic (equivocal=positive) and optimistic (equivocal = negative) interpretations. We compared the diagnostic performance of mpMRI, CT, and BS in detecting metastases.  Results:   In total, 364 men underwent CT and mpMRI, and 646 underwent BS and mpMRI. Based on the BVC, 52 men (14%) harbored LN metastases and 38 (5.9%) harbored bone metastases. Sensitivity of mpMRI for LN metastases was significantly higher than CT (65-73% vs 38%, P < 0.005), and specificity of mpMRI and CT were 97% to 99% and 99% (P = 0.2-0.4), respectively. For bone metastases, BS sensitivity was 68% as compared to 42% to 71% (P = 0.02-0.83) for mpMRI. Specificity for bone metastases was 95% to 99% across all modalities.  Conclusions:   Using statewide data, mpMRI appears superior to CT and comparable to BS for detection of LN and bone metastases, respectively.

We have proposed the necessity to preserve the Denonvilliers' fascia in patients with rectal cancer. However, how to accurately locate the Denonvilliers' fascia is unclear. This study aimed to explore anatomical features of the Denonvilliers' fascia by comparing autopsy findings and observations of surgical videos so as to propose a dissection method for the preservation of pelvic autonomic nerves during rectal cancer surgery.  Methods:   Five adult male cadaver specimens were dissected, and surgical videos of 135 patients who underwent TME for mid-low rectal cancer between January 2009 and February 2019 were reviewed to identify and compare the structure of the Denonvilliers' fascia.  Results:   The monolayer structure of the Denonvilliers' fascia was observed in 5 male cadaver specimens, and it was located between the rectum, the bottom of the bladder, the seminal vesicles, the vas deferens, and the prostate. The Denonvilliers' fascia was originated from the rectovesical pouch (or rectum-uterus pouch), down to fuse caudally with the rectourethral muscle at the apex of the prostate, and fused to the lateral ligaments on both sides. The fascia was thinner on the midline with a thickness of 1.06 ± 0.10 mm. The crown shape of the Denonvilliers' fascia was slightly triangular, with a height of approximately 5.42 ± 0.16 cm at midline. Nerves were more densely distributed in front of the Denonvilliers' fascia than behind, especially on both sides of it. Under laparoscopic view, the Denonvilliers' fascia was originated at the lowest point of the rectovesical pouch (or rectum-uterus pouch), with a thickened white line which was a good mark for identifying the Denonvilliers' fascia.  Conclusion:   Identification of the surgical indication line for the Denonvilliers' fascia could help us identify the Denonvilliers' fascia, and it would improve our ability to protect the pelvic autonomic function of patients undergoing TME for rectal cancer.""","""['Jianglong Huang', 'Jing Liu', 'Jiafeng Fang', 'Zongheng Zeng', 'Bo Wei', 'Tufeng Chen', 'Hongbo Wei']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Cancer Commun (Lond)""","""['Reconsideration of the Anterior Surgical Plane of Total Mesorectal Excision for Rectal Cancer.', ""Video.

This study investigates benefits and harms of screening strategies stratified by PSA levels.  Methods:   PSA levels and diagnosis patterns from two microsimulation models of prostate cancer progression, detection, and mortality were compared against results of the Malmö Preventive Project, which stored serum and tracked subsequent prostate cancer diagnoses for 25 years. The models predicted the harms (tests and overdiagnoses) and benefits (lives saved and life-years gained) of PSA-stratified screening strategies compared with biennial screening from age 45 years to age 69 years.  Results:   Compared with biennial screening for ages 45-69 years, lengthening screening intervals for men with PSA less than 1.0 ng/mL at age 45 years led to 46.8-47.0% fewer tests (range between models), 0.9-2.1% fewer overdiagnoses, and 3.1-3.8% fewer lives saved. Stopping screening when PSA was less than 1.0 ng/mL at age 60 years and older led to 12.8-16.0% fewer tests, 5.0-24.0% fewer overdiagnoses, and 5.0-13.1% fewer lives saved. Differences in model results can be partially explained by differences in assumptions about the link between PSA growth and the risk of disease progression.  Conclusion:   Relative to a biennial screening strategy, PSA-stratified screening strategies investigated in this study substantially reduced the testing burden and modestly reduced overdiagnosis while preserving most lives saved. Further research is needed to clarify the link between PSA growth and disease progression.""","""['Eveline A M Heijnsdijk', 'Roman Gulati', 'Alex Tsodikov', 'Jane M Lange', 'Angela B Mariotto', 'Andrew J Vickers', 'Sigrid V Carlsson', 'Ruth Etzioni']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""J Natl Cancer Inst""","""['Erratum.', 'Re: Lifetime Benefits and Harms of PSA-Based Risk Screening for Prostate Cancer.', 'Comparative effectiveness of alternative prostate-specific antigen--based prostate cancer screening strategies: model estimates of potential benefits and harms.', 'Overdiagnosis and Lives Saved by Reflex Testing Men With Intermediate Prostate-Specific Antigen Levels.', 'Projecting Benefits and Harms of Novel Cancer Screening Biomarkers: A Study of PCA3 and Prostate Cancer.', 'Screening for prostate cancer with the prostate-specific antigen test: a review of current evidence.', 'Focus on the screening for prostate cancer by PSA.', 'Prostate cancer incidence in men with prostate-specific antigen below 3\xa0ng/mL: The Finnish Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer.', 'Urinary marker panels for aggressive prostate cancer detection.', 'Redefining Age-Based Screening and Diagnostic Guidelines: An Opportunity for Biological Aging Clocks in Clinical Medicine?', 'Evaluation of Prostate Cancer Screening Strategies in a Low-Resource, High-risk Population in the Bahamas.', 'Prediction of future risk of any and higher-grade prostate cancer based on the PLCO and SELECT trials.']"""

Recent studies showed that CMR has a broad spectrum of anticancer activities and induces paraptosis in breast cancer and prostate cancer cells. In this study, we investigated the effects of CMR against human non-small cell lung cancer cells and the underlying mechanisms. We found that CMR dose-dependently inhibited the proliferation of human lung cancer H460, A549 and PC-9 cells. Furthermore, exposure to low and median doses of CMR induced paraptosis but not apoptosis, which was presented as the formation of extensive cytoplasmic vacuolation with increased expression of endoplasmic reticulum stress markers, Bip and Chop, as well as activation of MAPK pathway in the lung cancer cells. Knockdown of Bip with siRNA not only reduced the cell-killing effect of CMR, but also decreased the percentage of cytoplasmic vacuoles in H460 cells. Moreover, CMR also increased the sensitivity of lung cancer cells to radiotherapy through enhanced endoplasmic reticulum stress. In lung cancer H460 cell xenograft nude mice, combined treatment of CMR and radiation caused greatly enhanced tumor growth inhibition with upregulation of endoplasmic reticulum stress proteins and activation of pErk in xenograft tumor tissue. These data demonstrate that the anticancer activity and radiosensitization effect of CMR result from inducing paraptosis, suggesting that CMR could be considered as a potential anticancer agent and radiation sensitizer in the future cancer therapeutics.""","""['Shi-Rong Zhang#', 'Xiao-Chen Zhang#', 'Jia-Feng Liang', 'Hong-Ming Fang', 'Hai-Xiu Huang', 'Yan-Yan Zhao', 'Xue-Qin Chen', 'Sheng-Lin Ma']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Acta Pharmacol Sin""","""['Chalcomoracin is a potent anticancer agent acting through triggering Oxidative stress via a mitophagy- and paraptosis-dependent mechanism.', 'Xanthatin induces glioma cell apoptosis and inhibits tumor growth via activating endoplasmic reticulum stress-dependent CHOP pathway.', 'Synergistic killing effect of paclitaxel and honokiol in non-small cell lung cancer cells through paraptosis induction.', 'Celastrol acts synergistically with afatinib to suppress non-small cell lung cancer cell proliferation by inducing paraptosis.', 'Inhibition of autophagy enhances heat-induced apoptosis in human non-small cell lung cancer cells through ER stress pathways.', 'Isolation of Chalcomoracin as a Potential α-Glycosidase Inhibitor from Mulberry Leaves and Its Binding Mechanism.', 'Mulberry Diels-Alder-type adducts: isolation, structure, bioactivity, and synthesis.', 'Clinical and Preclinical Outcomes of Combining Targeted Therapy With Radiotherapy.', 'Swainsonine Triggers Paraptosis via ER Stress and MAPK Signaling Pathway in Rat Primary Renal Tubular Epithelial Cells.', 'Long non-coding RNA CASC2 enhances irradiation-induced endoplasmic reticulum stress in NSCLC cells through PERK signaling.']"""

Inappropriate activation of the stroma potentiates the growth and transformation of epithelial tumor cells. Here, we show that upregulation of monoamine oxidase A (MAOA), a mitochondrial enzyme that degrades monoamine neurotransmitters and dietary amines, in stromal cells elevates production of reactive oxygen species, triggers an inflammatory response including activation of IL-6, and promotes tumorigenesis in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, MAOA enhances IL-6 transcription through direct Twist1 binding to a conserved E-box element at the IL-6 promoter. MAOA in stromal fibroblasts provides tumor cell growth advantages through paracrine IL-6/STAT3 signaling. Tissue microarray analysis revealed co-expression correlations between individual pairs of proteins of the stromal MAOA-induced Twist1/IL-6/STAT3 pathway in clinical specimens. Downstream of stromal MAOA, STAT3 also promotes cell stemness and transcriptionally activates expression of cancer stem cell marker CD44 in PC cells. MAOA inhibitor treatment effectively suppressed prostate tumor growth in mice in a stroma-specific targeted manner.

In the present study, we analysed the glycans of PSA obtained from culture medium containing cancer tissue-originated spheroids (CTOS) which have similar characteristics as that of the parent tumour to explore the new candidates for cancer-related glycoforms of PSA. The glycan profile of PSA from CTOS was determined by comparing with PSA from normal seminal plasma and cancer cell lines (LNCaP and 22Rv1) using lectin chromatography and mass spectrometry. PSA from CTOS was mostly sialylated and the content of Wisteria floribunda agglutinin reactive glycan (LacdiNAc) was similar to that of PSA derived from seminal plasma and 22Rv1. Conversely, concanavalin A (Con A)-unbound PSA was definitely detected from the three cancer origins but was almost negligible in seminal PSA. Two novel types of PSA were elucidated in the Con A-unbound fraction: one is a high molecular weight PSA with highly branched N-glycans, and the other is a low molecular weight PSA without N-glycans. Furthermore, the existence of Lewis X antigen group on PSA was indicated.

Welding fumes (WFs) are a complex mix of metallic oxides, fluorides and silicates that can cause or exacerbate health problems in exposed individuals. In particular, WF inhalation over an extended period carries an increased risk of cancer, but how WFs may influence cancer behaviour or growth is unclear. To address this issue we employed a quantitative analytical framework to identify the gene expression effects of WFs that may affect the subsequent behaviour of the cancers. We examined datasets of transcript analyses made using microarray studies of WF-exposed tissues and of cancers, including datasets from colorectal cancer (CC), prostate cancer (PC), lung cancer (LC) and gastric cancer (GC). We constructed gene-disease association networks, identified signaling and ontological pathways, clustered protein-protein interaction network using multilayer network topology, and analyzed survival function of the significant genes using Cox proportional hazards (Cox PH) model and product-limit (PL) estimator. We observed that WF exposure causes altered expression of many genes (36, 13, 25 and 17 respectively) whose expression are also altered in CC, PC, LC and GC. Gene-disease association networks, signaling and ontological pathways, protein-protein interaction network, and survival functions of the significant genes suggest ways that WFs may influence the progression of CC, PC, LC and GC. This quantitative analytical framework has identified potentially novel mechanisms by which tissue WF exposure may lead to gene expression changes in tissue gene expression that affect cancer behaviour and, thus, cancer progression, growth or establishment.""","""['Humayan Kabir Rana#', 'Mst Rashida Akhtar#', 'M Babul Islam', 'Mohammad Boshir Ahmed', 'Pietro Lió', 'Fazlul Huq', 'Julian M W Quinn', 'Mohammad Ali Moni']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Sci Rep""","""['Genetic effects of welding fumes on the development of respiratory system diseases.', 'Genetic effects of welding fumes on the progression of neurodegenerative diseases.', 'Welding Fume Instillation in Isolated Perfused Mouse Lungs-Effects of Zinc- and Copper-Containing Welding Fumes.', 'Welding-related respiratory diseases.', 'Health hazards of welding fumes.', 'Identification of Comorbidities, Genomic Associations, and Molecular Mechanisms for COVID-19 Using Bioinformatics Approaches.', 'Network-Based Data Analysis Reveals Ion Channel-Related Gene Features in COVID-19: A Bioinformatic Approach.', 'Bioinformatics and System Biological Approaches for the Identification of Genetic Risk Factors in the Progression of Cardiovascular Disease.', 'ESRRG, ATP4A, and ATP4B as Diagnostic Biomarkers for Gastric Cancer: A Bioinformatic Analysis Based on Machine Learning.', 'Analysis of Differentially Expressed Genes That Aggravate Metabolic Diseases in Depression.']"""

This study aimed to determine whether Cd exposure could malignantly transform BPH1 cells and, if so, to dissect the mechanism of action. We deciphered the molecular signaling responsible for BPH1 transformation via RNA-sequencing and determined that Cd induced the expression of zinc finger of the cerebellum 2 (ZIC2) in BPH1 cells. We noted Cd exposure increased ZIC2 expression in the Cd-transformed BPH1 cells that in turn promoted anchorage-independent spheroids and increased expression of stem cell drivers, indicating their role in stem cell renewal. Subsequent silencing of ZIC2 expression in transformed cells inhibited spheroid formation, stem cell marker expression, and tumor growth in nude mice. At the molecular level, ZIC2 interacts with the glioma-associated oncogene family (GLI) zinc finger 1 (GLI1), which activates prosurvival factors (nuclear factor NFκB, B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl2), as well as an X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP)) signaling in Cd-exposed BPH1 cells. Conversely, overexpression of ZIC2 in BPH1 cells caused spheroid formation confirming the oncogenic function of ZIC2. ZIC2 activation and GLI1 signaling induction by Cd exposure in primary BPH cells confirmed the clinical significance of this oncogenic function. Finally, human BPH specimens had increased ZIC2 versus adjacent healthy tissues. Thus, we report direct evidence that Cd exposure induces malignant transformation of BPH via activation of ZIC2 and GLI1 signaling.""","""['Balaji Chandrasekaran#', 'Nisha R Dahiya#', 'Ashish Tyagi', 'Venkatesh Kolluru', 'Uttara Saran', 'Becca V Baby', 'J Christopher States', 'Ahmed Q Haddad', 'Murali K Ankem', 'Chendil Damodaran']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Oncogenesis""","""['Zic2 synergistically enhances Hedgehog signalling through nuclear retention of Gli1 in cervical cancer cells.', 'Addiction of pancreatic cancer cells to zinc-finger transcription factor ZIC2.', 'Silencing KRAS Overexpression in Cadmium-Transformed Prostate Epithelial Cells Mitigates Malignant Phenotype.', 'Malignant transformation in a nontumorigenic human prostatic epithelial cell line.', 'A novel molecular mechanism for a long non-coding RNA PCAT92 implicated in prostate cancer.', 'ZIC2 induces pro-tumor macrophage polarization in nasopharyngeal carcinoma by activating the JUNB/MCSF axis.', 'Antiandrogen-Equipped Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors Selectively Inhibit Androgen Receptor (AR) and AR-Splice Variant (AR-SV) in Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer (CRPC).', 'Urolithin A analog inhibits castration-resistant prostate cancer by targeting the androgen receptor and its variant, androgen receptor-variant 7.', 'A small molecule inhibitor of Notch1 modulates stemness and suppresses breast cancer cell growth.', 'Cadmium: A Focus on the Brown Crab (Cancer pagurus) Industry and Potential Human Health Risks.']"""

Methods:   This study includes patients seeking care at an academic medical center, 2008 to 2018. Digital data sources are combined to address missingness, inaccuracy, and noise common to EHR data. Clinical concepts were identified and extracted from EHR unstructured data using natural language processing (NLP) and machine/deep learning techniques. All models are trained, tested, and validated on independent data samples using standard metrics.  Results:   We provide use cases for using EHR data to assess guideline adherence and quality measurements among patients with cancer. Pretreatment assessment was evaluated by guideline adherence and quality metrics for cancer staging metrics. Our studies in perioperative quality focused on medications administered and guideline adherence. Patient outcomes included treatment-related side effects and patient-reported outcomes.  Conclusions:   Advanced technologies applied to EHRs present opportunities to advance population-level quality assessment, to learn from routinely collected clinical data for personalized treatment guidelines, and to augment epidemiologic and population health studies. The effective use of digital data can inform patient-valued care, quality initiatives, and policy guidelines.  Impact:   A comprehensive set of health data analyzed with advanced technologies results in a unique resource that facilitates wide-ranging, innovative, and impactful research on prostate cancer.

This series of experiments aimed to explore how Yes-associated protein 1 (YAP1) regulates the function of stromal cells and how the normal fibroblasts (NFs) convert into CAFs in prostate cancer (PCa).  Methods:   The effects of conditioned media from different fibroblasts on the proliferation and invasion of epithelial cells TrampC1 were examined. We then analysed the interaction between the YAP1/TEAD1 protein complex and SRC, as well as the regulatory function of the downstream cytoskeletal proteins and actins. A transplanted tumour model was used to explore the function of YAP1 in regulating tumour growth through stromal cells. The relationship between the expression of YAP1 in tumour stromal cells and the clinical characteristics of PCa patients was analysed.  Results:   The expression level of YAP1 was significantly upregulated in PCa stromal cells. After the expression level of YAP1 was increased, NF was transformed into CAF, enhancing the proliferation and invasion ability of epithelial cells. The YAP1/TEAD1 protein complex had the capability to influence downstream cytoskeletal proteins by regulating SRC transcription; therefore, it converts NF to CAF, and CAF can significantly promote tumour growth and metastasis. The high expression of YAP1 in the tumour stromal cells suggested a poor tumour stage and prognosis in PCa patients.  Conclusion:   YAP1 can convert NFs into CAFs in the tumour microenvironment of PCa, thus promoting the development and metastasis of PCa.

For patients who filled a perioperative opioid prescription (30 days before to 14 days after surgery), we calculated the incidence of new persistent postoperative opioid use (≥1 prescription 90-180 days after surgery). Multivariable logistic regression was performed to investigate the association between the surgical approach, patient risk factors, and persistent opioid use. Results: Twelve thousand two hundred seventy-eight radical prostatectomy patients filled an opioid prescription perioperatively (1510 [12%] open and 10,768 [88%] robot assisted). Of these, 846 (6.9%) patients continued to fill opioid prescription(s) 90 to 180 days after surgery. Patients undergoing RARP were 35% less likely to develop new persistent opioid use compared with those undergoing open radical prostatectomy (6.5% vs 9.7%; adjusted odds ratio 0.65; 95% confidence interval 0.54, 0.79). Other independent risk factors included living in the southern, western, or north central United States; preoperative comorbidity; and tobacco use. Conclusions: Approximately 6.9% of opioid-naive patients continued to fill opioid prescriptions 90 days after radical prostatectomy.

Materials and methods:   A total of 601 men were screened for prostate cancer in 2012, 2015, and 2016 using prostate cancer biomarkers: prostate health index (phi), 4KScore, and SelectMDx. The first two are blood tests that incorporate several PSA isoforms; SelectMDx measures mRNA levels of homeobox C6 and distal-less homeobox 1 in post-digital rectal examination urine samples. The performance of each biomarker was evaluated using cut off values based on published literature. Gleason Grade Group (GG) ≥ 2 is considered as high-grade prostate cancer.  Results:   For patients with PSA < 1.5 ng/mL, none were at risk for GG ≥ 2 cancer based on SelectMDx > 0%, whereas 17.1% were at intermediate to high risk of finding GG ≥ 2 cancer with 4KScore ≥ 7.5%, and 3.5% were at risk of finding any prostate cancer with phi ≥ 36 at biopsy. For cut offs revised for finding men at high risk for GG ≥ 2 cancer at biopsy, only one patient with PSA < 1.5 ng/mL would be at risk with 4KScore ≥ 20% and none with phi ≥ 52.7. For patients with PSA 1.5 to 3.99 ng/mL, 2%, 8%, and 1% were at high risk for finding GG ≥ 2 cancer at biopsy based on phi, 4KScore, and SelectMDx, respectively.  Conclusions:   Men with PSA < 1.5 ng/mL are at very low risk of finding high-grade prostate cancer at biopsy. However, some men with PSA between 1.5 to 3.99 ng/mL may be at intermediate to high risk for high-grade prostate cancer. Thus, primary care physicians could run biomarkers test and refer those with positive biomarker results to a specialist for further evaluation.""","""['Whitney N Stanton', 'E David Crawford', 'Paul B Arangua', 'Francisco G La Rosa', 'Adrie van Bokhoven', 'M Scott Lucia', 'Wendy L Poage', 'Alan Partin', 'Paul Maroni', 'Priya N Werahera']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Can J Urol""","""['Secondary screening tests for prostate cancer: is more information better?

Each option has side effects associated with it, leading to difficulty in decision-making. This study aimed to assess the relationship between patient involvement in treatment decision-making and subsequent decision regret (DR), and quantify the impact of health-related quality of life (HRQL) outcomes on DR.  Methods:   Men living in the United Kingdom, 18 to 42 months after diagnosis of PCa, were identified from cancer registration data and sent a questionnaire. Measures included the Decision Regret Scale (DRS), Expanded Prostate cancer Index Composite short form (EPIC-26), EQ-5D-5L, and an item on involvement in treatment decision-making. Multivariable ordinal regression was utilized, with DR categorized as none, mild, or moderate/severe regret.  Results:   A total of 17 193 men with stage I-III PCa completed the DRS: 36.6% reported no regret, 43.3% mild regret, and 20.0% moderate/severe regret. The odds of reporting DR were greater if men indicated their views were not taken into account odds ratio ([OR] = 6.42, 95% CI: 5.39-7.64) or were involved ""to some extent"" in decision-making (OR = 4.63, 95% CI: 4.27-5.02), compared with men who were ""definitely"" involved. After adjustment, including for involvement, men reporting moderate/big problems with urinary, bowel, or sexual function were more likely to experience regret compared with men with no/small problems. Better HRQL scores were associated with lower levels of DR.  Conclusions:   This large-scale study demonstrates the benefit of patient involvement in treatment decision-making for nonmetastatic PCa.

Herein, we studied the underlying mechanism(s) of action of arctigenin on acidity-tolerant prostate cancer PC-3AcT cells in the lactic acid-containing medium. At concentration showing no toxicity on normal prostate epithelial RWPE-1 and HPrEC cells, arctigenin alone or in combination with docetaxel induced significant cytotoxicity in PC-3AcT cells compared to parental PC-3 cells. With arctigenin treatment, reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, annexin V-PE positive fractions, sub-G0/G1 peak in cell cycle analysis, mitochondrial membrane depolarization, and cell communication network factor 1 (CCN1) levels were increased, while cellular ATP content and phospho (p)-Akt level were decreased. Pretreatment with ROS scavenger N-acetylcysteine effectively reversed the series of phenomena caused by arctigenin, suggesting that ROS served as upstream molecules of arctigenin-driven cytotoxicity. Meanwhile, arctigenin increased the levels of p-receptor-interacting serine/threonine-protein kinase 3 (p-RIP3) and p-mixed lineage kinase domain-like pseudokinase (p-MLKL) as necroptosis mediators, and pretreatment with necroptosis inhibitor necrostatin-1 restored their levels and cell viability. Treatment of spheroids with arctigenin resulted in necroptotic cell death, which was prevented by N-acetylcysteine. The siRNA-based knockdown of CCN1 suppressed the levels of MLKL, B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2), and induced myeloid leukemia cell differentiation (Mcl-1) with increased cleavage of Bcl-2-associated X (Bax) and caspase-3. Collectively, these results provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying arctigenin-induced cytotoxicity, and support arctigenin as a potential therapeutic agent for targeting non-Warburg phenotype through induction of necroptosis via ROS-mediated mitochondrial damage and CCN1 upregulation.""","""['Yoon-Jin Lee', 'Hae-Seon Nam', 'Moon-Kyun Cho', 'Sang-Han Lee']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Mol Cell Biochem""","""['Arctigenin shows preferential cytotoxicity to acidity-tolerant prostate carcinoma PC-3\u202fcells through ROS-mediated mitochondrial damage and the inhibition of PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway.', 'Curcumin Targets Both Apoptosis and Necroptosis in Acidity-Tolerant Prostate Carcinoma Cells.', 'Cytosolic calcium mediates RIP1/RIP3 complex-dependent necroptosis through JNK activation and mitochondrial ROS production in human colon cancer cells.', 'Arctigenin, an anti-tumor agent; a cutting-edge topic and up-to-the-minute approach in cancer treatment.', 'Mitochondrial Mechanisms of Necroptosis in Liver Diseases.', ""Let's Go 3D!

Materials and methods:   Thirty PCa patients at high risk of metastases prospectively underwent both a 3D T1 FSE (14 min) and a rapid 3D T1 GEmDixon (1 min 20 s) sequences within a WB-MRI protocol. Two readers assessed the diagnostic performance of the FSE/Fat/in-phase (IP)/IP+Fat sequences in detecting bone and node metastases. The reference standard was established by a panel of four physicians on the basis of all baseline and follow-up imaging, biological and clinical information. The reproducibility of readings, predictive accuracy (Acc) from ROC curves analysis, and contrast-to-reference ratio (CRR) in lesions were assessed for each sequence.  Results:   In bone and lymph nodes (per-region analysis), reproducibility was at least good for all sequences/readers, except for nodes in the common iliac/inguinal regions. In bone (per-organ analysis), Acc of FSE was superior to that of mDixon (difference + 4%, p < 0.0083). In nodes (per-organ analysis), Acc of Fat was superior to that of other sequences (difference + 4% to + 6% depending on reader, p < 0.0083). In the per-patient analysis, Acc of FSE was superior to that of mDixon (difference + 4% to + 6% depending on sequence, p < 0.0083). Fat images had higher CRR compared with FSE in the thoracic spine, the bony pelvis and lymph node metastases (p < 0.025).  Conclusion:   3D T1 GEmDixon may replace 3D T1 FSE to complement DWI in WB-MRI for metastatic screening in PCa. It demonstrates an Acc ranging from + 4% to + 6% (nodes) to - 4% to - 6% (bone and patient staging) compared with FSE and considerably reduces the examination time, offering the perspective of acquiring WB-MRI examinations in less than 20 min.  Key points:   • The replacement of 3D T1 FSE by the 3D T1 GE mDixon as morphologic sequence to complement DWI drastically reduces the acquisition time of WB-MRI studies. • The 3D T1 GE mDixon sequence offers similar reproducibility of image readings compared with that of the 3D T1 FSE. • Differences in diagnostic accuracy are limited (+ 4%/+ 6% in favor of mDixon to detect node metastases; + 4%/+ 6% in favor of FSE to detect bone metastases/metastatic disease in a patient).""","""['Frédéric E Lecouvet', 'Vassiliki Pasoglou', 'Sandy Van Nieuwenhove', 'Thomas Van Haver', 'Quentin de Broqueville', 'Vincent Denolin', 'Perrine Triqueneaux', 'Bertrand Tombal', 'Nicolas Michoux']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Eur Radiol""","""['Whole-body MRI in oncology: can a single anatomic T2 Dixon sequence replace the combination of T1 and STIR sequences to detect skeletal metastasis and myeloma?', 'Multiparametric whole-body 3.0-T MRI in newly diagnosed intermediate- and high-risk prostate cancer: diagnostic accuracy and interobserver agreement for nodal and metastatic staging.', 'Whole-body 3D T1-weighted MR imaging in patients with prostate cancer: feasibility and evaluation in screening for metastatic disease.', 'Diagnostic value of whole-body magnetic resonance imaging for bone metastases: a systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Whole-body MRI: detecting bone metastases from prostate cancer.', 'Current state-of-the-art imaging techniques in the domain of whole-body MRI and its advantages over other whole-body PET in different musculoskeletal diseases.', 'MRI fat fraction imaging of nodal and bone metastases in prostate cancer.', 'Advances in Bone Marrow Imaging: Strengths and Limitations from a Clinical Perspective.', 'Evaluating prostate cancer bone metastasis using accelerated whole-body isotropic 3D T1-weighted Dixon MRI with compressed SENSE: a feasibility study.', 'Whole-body MRI in oncology: can a single anatomic T2 Dixon sequence replace the combination of T1 and STIR sequences to detect skeletal metastasis and myeloma?']"""

Materials and methods:   For 1 year, we prospectively assessed the feasibility of SDD RARP in the context of ERAS and prehabilitation pathways. SDD patients were compared to overnight patients operated during the same period by the same surgeon. Primary outcomes were complication and 90-day readmission rates.  Results:   Of the overall cohort, 51.9% were discharged home the day of surgery. Both cohorts were comparable in terms of pre-operative and intra-operative characteristics. There was a not significant trend towards shorter operative time in the SDD cohort (93.7 versus 105.2 min, p = 0.077). Mean blood loss was comparable between both cohorts. No significant difference in terms of complication (p = 0.606; 16.0% versus 11.1%) and readmission rates (< 4%) was noted. There was a not significant trend towards faster continence recovery for patients included in the SDD cohort, compared with those in the inpatient cohort. The overall cost per patient was reduced by 10.8% with SDD surgery with no increased cost due to emergency visits or readmissions CONCLUSIONS: Implementation of SDD RARP in the context of ERAS and prehabilitation pathways is safe, reduces cost and does not compromise the post-operative course.

Their main advantage is that they maintain the distinctive genomic and functional heterogeneity of the original tissue compared to conventional cell lines that do not. Furthermore, 3D cultures of PDO can be used to predict the effects of drug treatment on individual patients and are a step towards personalized medicine. Despite these advantages, few groups routinely use this method in part because of the extensive optimization of PDO culture conditions that may be required for different patient samples. We previously demonstrated that our prostate cancer bone metastasis PDX model, PCSD1, recapitulated the resistance of the donor patient's bone metastasis to anti-androgen therapy. We used PCSD1 3D organoids to characterize further the mechanisms of anti-androgen resistance. Following an overview of currently published studies of PDX and PDO models, we describe a step-by-step protocol for 3D culture of PDO using domed or floating basement membrane (e.g., Matrigel) spheres in optimized culture conditions. In vivo stitch imaging and cell processing for histology are also described. This protocol can be further optimized for other applications including western blot, co-culture, etc. and can be used to explore characteristics of 3D cultured PDO pertaining to drug resistance, tumorigenesis, metastasis and therapeutics.""","""['Sanghee Lee', 'Danielle N Burner', 'Theresa R Mendoza', 'Michelle T Muldong', 'Catalina Arreola', 'Christina N Wu', 'Nicholas A Cacalano', 'Anna A Kulidjian', 'Christopher J Kane', 'Christina A M Jamieson']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""J Vis Exp""","""['Novel Dormancy Mechanism of Castration Resistance in Bone Metastatic Prostate Cancer Organoids.', 'PCSD1, a new patient-derived model of bone metastatic prostate cancer, is castrate-resistant in the bone-niche.', 'A synopsis of prostate organoid methodologies, applications, and limitations.', 'A 3D in\xa0vitro model of patient-derived prostate cancer xenograft for controlled interrogation of in\xa0vivo tumor-stromal interactions.', 'Patient derived organoids in prostate cancer: improving therapeutic efficacy in precision medicine.', 'Advances in Tumor Organoids for the Evaluation of Drugs: A Bibliographic Review.', 'Novel Dormancy Mechanism of Castration Resistance in Bone Metastatic Prostate Cancer Organoids.', 'Mechanisms, Diagnosis and Treatment of Bone Metastases.', 'Application of Organoid Models in Prostate Cancer Research.', 'Functional assays with human patient-derived enteroid monolayers to assess the human gut barrier.']"""

A stimulated-echo (STE) DWI acquisition is evaluated for high-CNR imaging of prostate cancer while maintaining SNR and reliable apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) mapping.  Methods:   In this prospective, IRB-approved study, 27 patients with suspected prostate cancer (PCa) were scanned with three DWI sequences (SE b = 800 s/mm2, SE b = 1500 s/mm2, and STE b = 800 s/mm2) after informed consent was obtained. ROIs were drawn on biopsy-confirmed cancer and non-cancerous tissue to perform quantitative SNR, CNR, and ADC measurements. Qualitative metrics (SNR, CNR, and overall image quality) were evaluated by three experienced radiologists. Metrics were compared pairwise between the three acquisitions using a t test (quantitative metrics) and Wilcoxon rank test (qualitative metrics).  Results:   Quantitative measurements showed that STE DWI at b = 800 s/mm2 has significantly better SNR compared to SE DWI at b = 1500 s/mm2 (p < 0.0001) and comparable CNR to high-b value SE DWI at b = 1500 s/mm2 (p < 0.05) in the peripheral zone. Qualitative assessment showed preference to STE b = 800 s/mm2 in SNR and SE b = 1500 s/mm2 in CNR. The overall image quality and lesion detectability among most readers showed no significant preference between STE b = 800 s/mm2 and SE b = 1500 s/mm2. Further, STE DWI had similar ADC contrast between lesion and normal tissue as SE DWI at b = 800 s/mm2 (p = 0.90).  Conclusion:   STE DWI has the potential to provide high-SNR, high-CNR imaging of prostate cancer while also enabling reliable ADC mapping.  Key points:   • Quantitative analysis showed that STE DWI at b = 800 s/mm2is able to achieve simultaneously high CNR, high SNR, and reliable ADC mapping, compared to SE b = 800 s/mm2and SE b = 1500 s/mm2. • Qualitative assessment by three readers showed that STE DWI at b = 800 s/mm2has significantly higher SNR than SE b = 1500 s/mm2.

We evaluated the cost-effectiveness of 68Ga-PSMA PET/MRI for staging men with prostate cancer biochemical recurrence. A cost-effectiveness analysis using a decision-analytic model with Markov chains was constructed. 68Ga-PSMA PET/MRI was compared with usual care in staging of men with suspected prostate cancer recurrence. Men with biochemical recurrence from a study in Brisbane, Australia (n = 30) provided key estimates for the model. The primary outcomes were health system costs and years of life (survival) over 10 years. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were undertaken to address uncertainty in model estimates. On average, a strategy of 68Ga-PSMA was expected to cost AU$56 961(US$39 426) and produce 7.48 life years compared with AU$64 499 (US$44 667) and 7.41 life years in usual care.

The prostate transmembrane protein, androgen induced 1 (PMEPA1), a multifunctional protein played critical roles in prostate tumorigenesis. The pleiotropic nature of PMEPA1 in modulating androgen and TGF-β signaling as well as splice variants mechanisms for functional regulations of cancer-associated genes prompted us to investigate the biological roles of PMEPA1 isoforms in prostate cancer. In addition to 4 reported PMEPA1 isoforms (a, b, c and d), one novel isoform PMEPA1-e was identified with RNA Seq analysis of hormone responsive VCaP, LNCaP cells and human prostate cancer samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset. We analyzed the structures, expressions, biological functions and clinical relevance of PMEPA1-e isoform and less characterized isoforms c and d in the context of prostate cancer and AR/TGF-β signaling. The expression of PMEPA1-e was induced by androgen and AR. In contrast, PMEPA1-d was responsive to TGF-β and inhibited TGF-β signaling. Both PMEPA1-d and PMPEA1-e promoted the growth of androgen independent prostate cancer cells. Although PMEPA1-c was responsive to TGF-β, it was found to have no impacts on cell growth and androgen/TGF-β signaling. The TCGA data analysis from 499 patients showed higher expression ratios of PMEAP1-b versus -d or -e strongly associated with enhanced Gleason score.

Objective:   To investigate the safety and efficacy of enzalutamide concurrent with salvage RT and ADT.  Design, setting, and participants:   This was a three-center prospective phase 2 single-arm trial (NCT02057939) of men with Gleason 7-10 PC and PSA recurrence within 4 yr of RP ranging from 0.2 to 4.0 ng/dl, no prior hormonal therapy, and no radiographic evidence of metastases. We enrolled 38 men; 37 completed therapy and were evaluable with testosterone recovery at 2 yr.  Intervention:   Six months of ADT with 160 mg/d enzalutamide and 66 Gy RT to the prostate bed.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   The primary endpoint was improved 2-yr progression-free survival (PFS) over historical controls. Secondary objectives included 3-yr PFS, safety, and patient-reported quality of life (QOL).  Results and limitations:   The primary endpoint of 2-yr PFS was 65% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 47, 78) versus 51% (95% CI: 33, 67) in a trial of men with similar eligibility treated with salvage RT and adjuvant docetaxel. The 3-yr PFS was 53%. Eleven (29%) men experienced G3 toxicities, and there were no G4-5 or unexpected toxicities. QOL data suggest modest worsening of bowel, bladder, and hormonal symptoms at 3 mo, with recovery by 24 mo in most men.  Conclusions:   Salvage RT with enzalutamide and ADT following RP for men with PSA recurrent high-risk PC is safe and demonstrates encouraging efficacy, warranting prospective controlled phase 3 trials of ADT with or without potent androgen receptor inhibition in this curative-intent setting.

Materials and methods:   A total of 123 men (mean age, 66.3±8.9 [SD]; range: 42-83 years) with PSA serum levels of 4∼10ng/mL with suspected csPCa were included. All patients underwent mpMRI at 3 Tesla and transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy in their clinical workup and were followed-up for >1 year when no csPCa was found at initial biopsy. The mpMRI images were reinterpreted according to the Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS, v2.1) twice in two different sessions using either mpMRI sequences or bpMRI sequences. The patients were divided into 2 groups according to whether csPCa was detected. The PI-RADS (mpMRI or bpMRI) categories and PSAD were used in combination to detect csPCa. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and decision curve analyses were performed to compare the efficacy of the different models (mpMRI, bpMRI, PSAD, mpMRI+PSAD and bpMRI+PSAD).  Results:   Thirty-seven patients (30.1%, 37/123) had csPCa. ROC analysis showed that bpMRI (AUC=0.884 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.814-0.935]) outperformed mpMRI (AUC=0.867 [95% CI: 0.794-0.921]) (P=0.035) and that bpMRI and mpMRI performed better than PSAD (0.682 [95% CI: 0.592-0.763]) in detecting csPCa; bpMRI+PSAD (AUC=0.907 [95% CI: 0.841-0.952]) performed similarly to mpMRI+PSAD (AUC=0.896 [95% CI: 0.828-0.944]) (P=0.151) and bpMRI (P=0.224). The sensitivity and specificity were 81.1% (95% CI: 64.8-92.0%) and 88.4% (95% CI: 79.7-94.3%), respectively for bpMRI, and 83.8% (95% CI: 68.0-93.8%) and 80.2% (95% CI: 70.2-88.0%), respectively for mpMRI (P>0.999 for sensitivity and P=0.016 for specificity). Among the 5 decision models, the decision curve analysis showed that all models (except for PSAD) achieved a high net benefit.  Conclusion:   In patients with PSA serum levels of 4∼10ng/mL, bpMRI and bpMRI combined with PSAD achieve better performance than mpMRI in detecting csPCa; bpMRI has a higher specificity than mpMRI, which could decrease unnecessary biopsy, and may serve as a potential alternative to mpMRI to optimize clinical workup.""","""['C Han', 'S Liu', 'X B Qin', 'S Ma', 'L N Zhu', 'X Y Wang']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Diagn Interv Imaging""","""['Clinically Significant Prostate Cancer Detection After a Negative Prebiopsy MRI Examination: Comparison of Biparametric Versus Multiparametric MRI.', 'Comparison of biparametric and multiparametric MRI in the diagnosis of prostate cancer.', 'Head-to-head comparison of biparametric versus multiparametric MRI of the prostate before robot-assisted transperineal fusion prostate biopsy.', 'The Use of Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging (mpMRI) in the Detection, Evaluation, and Surveillance of Clinically Significant Prostate Cancer (csPCa).', 'Positive Predictive Value of Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System Version 2 for the Detection of Clinically Significant Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.', 'Detection of intermediate- and high-risk prostate cancer with biparametric magnetic resonance imaging: a systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Biparametric MRI-based radiomics classifiers for the detection of prostate cancer in patients with PSA serum levels of 4∼10 ng/mL.', 'Pan-Asian adapted ESMO Clinical Practice Guidelines for the diagnosis, treatment and follow-up of patients with prostate cancer.', 'Current Status of Biparametric MRI in Prostate Cancer Diagnosis: Literature Analysis.', 'The Role of PSA Density among PI-RADS v2.1 Categories to Avoid an Unnecessary Transition Zone Biopsy in Patients with PSA 4-20\u2009ng/mL.']"""

If a treatment passes through early-phase experiments, the investigators may want to assess it in a late-phase randomised controlled trial. An efficient way to do this is adding it as a new research arm to an ongoing trial while the existing research arms continue, a so-called multi-arm platform trial. The familywise type I error rate is often a key quantity of interest in any multi-arm platform trial. We set out to clarify how it should be calculated when new arms are added to a trial some time after it has started.  Methods:   We show how the familywise type I error rate, any-pair and all-pairs powers can be calculated when a new arm is added to a platform trial. We extend the Dunnett probability and derive analytical formulae for the correlation between the test statistics of the existing pairwise comparison and that of the newly added arm. We also verify our analytical derivation via simulations.  Results:   Our results indicate that the familywise type I error rate depends on the shared control arm information (i.e. individuals in continuous and binary outcomes and primary outcome events in time-to-event outcomes) from the common control arm patients and the allocation ratio. The familywise type I error rate is driven more by the number of pairwise comparisons and the corresponding (pairwise) type I error rates than by the timing of the addition of the new arms. The familywise type I error rate can be estimated using Šidák's correction if the correlation between the test statistics of pairwise comparisons is less than 0.30.  Conclusions:   The findings we present in this article can be used to design trials with pre-planned deferred arms or to add new pairwise comparisons within an ongoing platform trial where control of the pairwise error rate or familywise type I error rate (for a subset of pairwise comparisons) is required.""","""['Babak Choodari-Oskooei', 'Daniel J Bratton', 'Melissa R Gannon', 'Angela M Meade', 'Matthew R Sydes', 'Mahesh Kb Parmar']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Clin Trials""","""['Assessing the impact of efficacy stopping rules on the error rates under the multi-arm multi-stage framework.', 'Type I error rates of multi-arm multi-stage clinical trials: strong control and impact of intermediate outcomes.', 'Flexible trial design in practice - stopping arms for lack-of-benefit and adding research arms mid-trial in STAMPEDE: a multi-arm multi-stage randomized controlled trial.', 'Comparison of multi-arm multi-stage design and adaptive randomization in platform clinical trials.', 'A group sequential, response-adaptive design for randomized clinical trials.', 'Online error rate control for platform trials.', 'Evaluating the effect of short-course rifapentine-based regimens with or without enhanced behaviour-targeted treatment support on adherence and completion of treatment for latent tuberculosis infection among adults in the UK (RID-TB: Treat): protocol for an open-label, multicentre, randomised controlled trial.', 'Statistical analysis plan for the motor neuron disease systematic multi-arm adaptive randomised trial (MND-SMART).', 'A comparison of clinical development pathways to advance tuberculosis regimen development.', 'Practical guidance for running late-phase platform protocols for clinical trials: lessons from experienced UK clinical trials units.']"""

SLIT2/ROBO1 signaling is very crucial pathway causally implicated in many cancers and reported to inhibit a variety of cancer cell types. CXCR4 is a chemokine receptor implicated in cancer progression. Silymarin is a phytochemical, of which anti-carcinogenic activity was suggested in various cancers, including prostate cancer. However, there are no studies examining the effect of silymarin on SLIT2-Robo1-CXCR4 axis. Herein, our goal is to explore cytotoxic and morphological effects of silymarin on DU145 cells and to reveal its role in Slit2/Robo and CXCR1 pathway. First, 24, 48 and 72 h-long cytotoxicity tests were performed for dose analysis of silymarin, followed H-E stain for morphological evaluation with varying doses of silymarin. Afterward, western blot and immunocytochemistry analyses were carried out for SLIT2, ROBO1 and CXCR4 proteins. According to MTT analysis, IC50 concentrations for silymarin were 315, 126 and 70 µM against DU145 cells for 24, 48 and 72 h treatments. In H-E, several apoptotic hallmarks, including, condensed, kidney-shaped and eccentric nuclei, membrane blebbings and apoptotic body formations were observed. Silymarin increased the expressions of SLIT2 and ROBO1 while decreased CXCR4 when compared to control group in immunocytochemistry and Western blot. To summarize, silymarin inhibited DU145 cells dose-dependently by activating SLIT2 protein and inhibiting expression of CXCR4. This study is the first examining the interplay between Slit2-Robo1-CXCR4 proteins and silymarin in DU145 cells.

However, the first prospective phase III trial (VISION) plans to use an elevated cumulative dose by applying 7.5 GBq in a 6-week interval. The aim of the present study was to compare safety and efficacy of the two aforementioned [177Lu]Lu-PSMA-617 therapy regimes (7.5 GBq every 6 weeks vs. 6.0 GBq every 8 weeks).  Methods:   A total number of 78 consecutive patients with mCRPC and a history of first-line chemotherapy were included in this retrospective analysis. The outcome of patients treated with 6.0 GBq [177Lu]Lu-PSMA-617 per cycle (n = 37) were compared with those treated with 7.5 GBq (n = 41) per cycle. The median therapy intervals were 8.4 weeks (6.0 GBq group) vs. 6.5 (7.5 GBq group). PSA response, PSA progression-free survival (PSA-PFS), overall survival, and adverse events were evaluated and compared between both groups. Chi-squared test, Kaplan Meier estimates, Cox regression, and log-rank test were used. The highest decline from pretherapeutic PSA levels was measured as percentage (best PSA response) and compared between groups by Wilcoxon test.  Results:   There was no significant difference comparing the rate of > 50% PSA decline or best PSA response between the 6.0 GBq and 7.5 GBq group (35% vs. 54%, p = 0.065; and - 40.2% vs. - 57.8%, p = 0.329). The median estimated survival and PSA-PFS did not significantly differ between the 6.0 GBq and 7.5 GBq groups as well (11.3 vs. 12.7 months, p = 0.384; and 9.5 vs. 12.3 months, p = 0.258). There was no significant difference regarding the change of kidney, liver, and blood cell parameters under therapy between the treatment groups.

We evaluated the temporal trends in LOLE for Australian cancer patients and the gain in life years for recently diagnosed patients due to survival improvements.  Methods:   Analysis was conducted using an Australian population-based cohort (n = 1,865,154) aged 50-89 years, who were primarily diagnosed with one of 19 leading cancers between 1982-2015. Flexible parametric survival models were used to estimate LOLE and the proportion of life lost (POLL) by year, age group, sex, and, for New South Wales only, spread of disease. The total years of LOLE and gain in life years due to survival improvements were estimated for those diagnosed in 2014.  Results:   For 19 cancers combined, LOLE and POLL were significantly lower for more recent diagnoses. Cancer-specific temporal trends were consistent by age, sex, and spread of disease (where relevant) although the magnitude varied. Prostate, kidney, or non-Hodgkin lymphoma experienced the largest decreases in POLL over time. For the 2014 diagnoses, an estimation of 403,094 life years lost will be caused by the 19 cancers. With the increase in cancer survival over time, the 2014 cohort will gain an extra 432,588 life years (52 %) compared to that experienced by the 1982 cohort.

No significant changes in erectile and urinary functions were noted from baseline compared to 40 days after TPFBx (P = .86 and P = .89). In comparison with TPSBx the sole differences were pain during prostatic sampling (P = .03), duration of hematospermia (P <.0001) and procedural time (P <.001) all higher for TPFBx. Clinically significant (cs) CaP was detected in n = 150 (53.8%) patients in the TPFBx group (34.9%, 51.7%, and 75% of Pirads 3, 4, and 5, respectively). Addition of systematic cores detected n = 25 csCaP that were missed by targeted cores (17.4% of all csCaP).  Conclusion:   TPFBx under LA are feasible, yielding high tolerability, low complications, no impact on erectile and urinary function and good csCaP detection. Addition of systematic to targeted cores remains recommended. Further studies are needed to confirm our findings.""","""['Giancarlo Marra', 'Alessandro Marquis', 'Stefano Tappero', ""Daniele D'Agate"", 'Marco Oderda', 'Giorgio Calleris', 'Marco Falcone', 'Riccardo Faletti', 'Luca Molinaro', 'Andrea Zitella', 'Laura Bergamasco', 'Paolo Gontero']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Urology""","""['EDITORIAL COMMENT.', 'Transperineal freehand multiparametric MRI fusion targeted biopsies under local anaesthesia for prostate cancer diagnosis: a multicentre prospective study of 1014 cases.', 'Pain in Men Undergoing Transperineal Free-Hand Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging Fusion Targeted Biopsies under Local Anesthesia: Outcomes and Predictors from a Multicenter Study of 1,008 Patients.', 'Feasibility of freehand MRI/US cognitive fusion transperineal biopsy of the prostate in local anaesthesia as in-office procedure-experience with 400 patients.', 'Complications After Systematic, Random, and Image-guided Prostate Biopsy.', 'Prostate biopsy: when and how to perform.', 'Robot-Assisted Magnetic Resonance Imaging-Targeted versus Systematic Prostate Biopsy; Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.', 'The SAFE Pilot Trial-SAlvage Focal Irreversible Electroporation-For Recurrent Localized Prostate Cancer: Rationale and Study Protocol.', 'Safety and feasibility of freehand transperineal prostate biopsy under local anesthesia: Our initial experience.', 'Recent Advances in Systematic and Targeted Prostate Biopsies.', 'Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging-Ultrasound Fusion Transperineal Prostate Biopsy: Diagnostic Accuracy from a Single Center Retrospective Study.']"""

A large body of evidence has shown that pattern 4 cribriform PCa (especially non-glomeruloid type) is associated with adverse pathologic features and clinical outcomes compared with non-cribriform pattern 4 PCa. The underlying mechanisms for the aggressiveness of cribriform PCa are not fully understood. The aim of this study is to compare the immunohistochemical expression of various biomarkers and to determine the potential proteins that may account for their biologic and clinical differences. A total of 14 biomarkers were studied. The number of non-glomeruloid cribriform PCa cases studied for each biomarker ranged from 18 to 74 and the number of non-cribriform pattern 4 PCa studied for each biomarker ranged from 29 to 112. We demonstrated that, compared with non-cribriform Gleason pattern 4 PCa, EGFR was significantly upregulated and standard CD44 (CD44s) was significantly downregulated in cribriform PCa; no significant differences were found in the expression of AR, NKX3.1, ERG, EZH2, p53, Rb, C-Myc, BCL2, p16, CyclinD1, Her2/Neu, and Synaptophysin between these two groups of pattern 4 PCa. The study also showed, compared to non-cribriform PCa, cribriform PCa presented with significantly higher serum PSA and more advanced tumor stage. The significant overexpression of EGFR and downregulation of CD44s in non-glomeruloid cribriform PCa may, at least, partly explain the unfavorable pathology and clinical results for this growth pattern. Given that EGFR targeted inhibitors are now available, the findings may also have significant therapeutic implications.""","""['Guang-Qian Xiao', 'Elise Nguyen', 'Pamela D Unger', 'Andy E Sherrod']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Exp Mol Pathol""","""['SOCS3 Immunohistochemical Expression Seems to Support the 2005 and 2014 International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) Modified Gleason Grading System.', 'PTEN loss in prostatic adenocarcinoma correlates with specific adverse histologic features (intraductal carcinoma, cribriform Gleason pattern 4 and stromogenic carcinoma).', 'Prostate cancer with cribriform morphology: diagnosis, aggressiveness, molecular pathology and possible relationships with intraductal carcinoma.', 'Cribriform morphology predicts upstaging after radical prostatectomy in patients with Gleason score 3 + 4 = 7 prostate cancer at transrectal ultrasound (TRUS)-guided needle biopsy.', 'The New Realization About Cribriform Prostate Cancer.', 'The Role of Tumor-Associated Antigen HER2/neu in Tumor Development and the Different Approaches for Using It in Treatment: Many Choices and Future Directions.', 'Single cell analysis of cribriform prostate cancer reveals cell intrinsic and tumor microenvironmental pathways of aggressive disease.', 'Cribriform Patterned Lesions in the Prostate Gland with Emphasis on Differential Diagnosis and Clinical Significance.', 'Cribriform Prostate Cancer: Clinical Pathologic and Molecular Considerations.', 'A distinct repertoire of cancer-associated fibroblasts is enriched in cribriform prostate cancer.']"""

Methods and materials:   We enrolled 25 men with favorable to high-risk prostate cancer and 1 to 3 suspicious multiparametric MRI (mpMRI) gross tumor volumes (GTVs). The mpMRI-GTVs were treated on day 1 with 12 to 14 Gy via dose cylinders using a lattice extreme ablative dose technique. The entire prostate, along with the proximal seminal vesicles, was then treated to 76 Gy at 2 Gy/fraction. For some high-risk patients, the distal seminal vesicles and pelvic lymph nodes received 56 Gy at 1.47 Gy/fraction concurrently in 38 fractions. The total dose to the lattice extreme ablative dose cylinder volume(s) was 88 to 90 Gy (112-123 Gy in 2.0 Gy equivalents, assuming an α-to-β ratio of 3).  Results:   Dosimetric parameters were satisfactorily met. Median follow-up was 66 months. There were no grade 3 acute/subacute genitourinary or gastrointestinal adverse events.

Methods:   Objective evaluations of pre- and postoperative cognitive function were performed upon admission and before hospital discharge, by using a neuropsychological test battery. We collected self-reported data on cognitive failures at 3 months postoperatively. Binary logistic regression analysis was used to assess the effects of surgical technique on postoperative cognitive performance.  Results:   The pre- and postoperative neuropsychological assessments were completed by 367 patients with a median age of 64 years (range 44-76). The incidence of postoperative cognitive dysfunction was 23.9% after robot-assisted (39/165) and 22.3% after open radical prostatectomy (45/202). There was no significant difference in postoperative cognitive function during the early postoperative period (P = 0.758) and self-reported cognitive failures at 3 months (P = 0.303) between robot-assisted and open surgery.

PC treatments may be associated with side effects, including second primary malignancies (SPM). There is limited information on the incidence of SPM among men with bone metastatic PC (mPC) and among men with bone metastatic castration-resistant PC (mCRPC). We estimated overall survival and the incidence of SPM in men with mPC and mCRPC.  Methods:   In the Prostate Cancer data Base Sweden, the National Prostate Cancer Register was linked to other national health care registers, 15,953 men with mPC in 1999-2011 were identified. Further, 693 men with mCRPC were identified. Outcomes were evaluated using stratified incidence rates, Kaplan-Meier estimators and Cox models.  Results:   The mean age among men with mPC was 73.9 years and in men with mCRPC 70.0 years. The median respective survivals were 1.5 (13,965 deaths) and 1.14 years (599 deaths), and average times since PC diagnosis 1.8 and 4.7 years. We observed 2,669 SPMs in men with mPC and 100 SPMs in men with mCRPC. The incidence rate of SPM per 1,000 person-years was 81.8 (78.8-85.0) for mPC and 115.6 (95.1-140.7) for mCRPC. High age, prior neoplasms, urinary tract infection, congestive heart failure, diabetes and renal disease were most strongly associated with increased mortality risk. Prior neoplasms and prior use of antineoplastic agents were most strongly associated with increased SPM risk. Several factors associated with increased mortality and SPM risks were more prevalent in the mCRPC cohort.  Conclusions:   Our results on mortality for men with mPC and mCRPC are in line with previous studies from the same time period. Investigation of factors associated with mortality and SPM in men with mPC and mCRPC can help to further understand these outcomes in the era prior to several new treatments have come available.""","""['Juha Mehtälä', 'Jihong Zong', 'Zdravko Vassilev', 'Gunnar Brobert', 'Montse Soriano Gabarró', 'Pär Stattin', 'Houssem Khanfir']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Incidence of second primary malignancies in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer: results from observational studies in three countries.', 'Anticancer Activity and Tolerance of Treatments Received Beyond Progression in Men Treated Upfront with Androgen Deprivation Therapy With or Without Docetaxel for Metastatic Castration-naïve Prostate Cancer in the GETUG-AFU 15 Phase 3 Trial.', 'Race does not predict skeletal-related events and all-cause mortality in men with castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Treatments for Metastatic Prostate Cancer (mPC): A Review of Costing Evidence.', 'Current and emerging therapies for bone metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Nanoparticle-Based Radioconjugates for Targeted Imaging and Therapy of Prostate Cancer.', 'A compendium of Androgen Receptor Variant 7 target genes and their role in Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Beyond BRCA: The Emerging Significance of DNA Damage Response and Personalized Treatment in Pancreatic and Prostate Cancer Patients.', 'ADXS31142 Immunotherapy ± Pembrolizumab Treatment for Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer: Open-Label Phase I/II KEYNOTE-046 Study.', 'Targeting the Intrinsic Apoptosis Pathway: A Window of Opportunity for Prostate Cancer.']"""

Both DLBCL and its treatments perturb the immune system, yet little is known about immune health during extended survivorship.  Methods:   In this retrospective cohort study, we compared 21,690 survivors of DLBCL from the California Cancer Registry (CCR) to survivors of breast, prostate, head and neck, and melanoma cancers. We linked their CCR records to a statewide database documenting hospital, emergency room, and ambulatory surgery visits and investigated the incidence of autoimmune conditions, immune deficiencies, and infections 1-10 years after cancer diagnosis.  Results:   We found elevated incidence rate ratios (IRRs) for many immune-related conditions in survivors of DLBCL compared with other cancer survivors, including significantly and consistently elevated IRRs for viral and fungal pneumonias (up to 10.8-fold), meningitis (up to 5.3-fold), as well as humoral deficiency (up to 17.6-fold) and autoimmune cytopenias (up to 12-fold). IRRs for most conditions remained high even in the late survivorship period (5-10 years after cancer diagnosis). The elevated risks could not be explained by exposure to chemotherapy, stem-cell transplantation, or rituximab, except for IRRs for humoral deficiency, which were consistently higher after the incorporation of rituximab into DLBCL treatments.  Conclusion:   To our knowledge, this is the largest cohort study with extended follow-up to demonstrate impaired immune health in survivors of DLBCL. The observed persistent, elevated risks for autoimmune diseases, immune deficiencies, and infectious conditions may reflect persistent immune dysregulation caused by lymphoma or treatment and may lead to excess morbidity and mortality during survivorship.

Systematic biopsy guided by transrectal ultrasound remains the standard for PCa diagnosis; however, the false negative rate is 10-20%. Multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) allows PCa visualization with a more precise localization and a higher accuracy and specificity for the detection of PCa. The physician can mentally relocate the most appropriate area detected on the prebiopsy mpMRI, based on its zonal topography and anatomical landmarks, called cognitive fusion. Herein, we concentrated on the accuracy of PCa localization in cognitive fusion compared with MRI-TRUS fusion and explored the applied scope of cognitive fusion.  Methods:   Thirty-two eligible patients with 36 PCa lesions were recruited for our study. TRUS examinations and MRI-TRUS fusion procedures were performed by experienced operators. The cognitive fusion images were compared using the TRUS image in a MRI-TRUS fusion workstation.  Results:   Using cognitive fusion imaging, 86.1% of the lesions were accurately located by the senior sonographer and 69.4% of the lesions were accurately located by the junior sonographer. The maximum diameter and PI-RADS score of the lesions were important factors that affected the accuracy of cognitive fusion (P < 0.05). Furthermore, the lesions with high PI-RADS scores and the lesions with large diameters were more accurately located using cognitive fusion (P < 0.05).

A unique in vitro 3D tumor model that uses a sequential culture (SC) of human mesenchymal stem cells followed by seeding with cancer cells after bone formation was initiated to study the phenotype-specific interaction between prostate cancer cells and bone microenvironment. The PCa cells were observed to be less prolific and less metastatic, and to form multicellular tumoroids in the bone microenvironment, whereas PC-3 cells were more prolific and were highly metastatic, and did not form multicellular tumoroids in the bone microenvironment. The metastatic process exhibited by these two prostate cancer cell lines showed a significant and different effect on bone mineralization and extracellular matrix formation. Excessive bone formation in the presence of PC-3 and significant osteolysis in the presence of PCa were observed, which was also indicated by osteocalcin and MMP-9 expression as measured by ELISA and qRT-PCR. The field emission scanning electron microscopy images revealed that the structure of mineralized collagen in the presence of PC-3 is different than the one observed in healthy bone. All experimental results indicated that both osteolytic and osteoblastic bone lesions can be recapitulated in our tumor testbed model and that different cancer phenotypes have a very different influence on bone at metastasis.

Materials and Methods: This retrospective study included 214 patients with PCa who received radical prostatectomy. Differences between groups were estimated using the χ2 test or Student's t-test. BCR rates were calculated according to the Kaplan-Meier method with the log-rank test. A Cox regression analysis was conducted for the multivariate analyses to identify significant predictors of BCR. Results: Of the 214 eligible men, 55 experienced BCR and 24 met the MetS diagnostic criteria. Multivariate Cox model analysis showed that patients with BCR had a higher Gleason score [hazard ratio (HR) 2.51, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.33-4.76] and positive nerve invasion (HR 3.57, 95% CI 1.85-6.88). MetS was not associated with BCR (HR 0.38, 95% CI 0.13-1.10).

Many are chemo- and radiotherapy resistant, thus conventional treatments fail to increase overall survival. Natural Killer (NK) cells exert anti-tumor activity upon detection of a complex array of tumor ligands, but this has not been thoroughly explored in the context of sarcoma immunotherapy. In this study, we investigated the NK cell receptor/ligand immune profile of primary human sarcoma explants. Analysis of tumors from 32 sarcoma patients identified the proliferative marker PCNA and DNAM-1 ligands CD112 and/or CD155 as commonly expressed antigens that could be efficiently targeted by genetically modified (GM) NK cells. Despite the strong expression of CD112 and CD155 on sarcoma cells, characterization of freshly dissociated sarcomas revealed a general decrease in tumor-infiltrating NK cells compared to the periphery, suggesting a defect in the endogenous NK cell response. We also applied a functional screening approach to identify relevant NK cell receptor/ligand interactions that induce efficient anti-tumor responses using a panel NK-92 cell lines GM to over-express 12 different activating receptors. Using GM NK-92 cells against primary sarcoma explants (n = 12) revealed that DNAM-1 over-expression on NK-92 cells led to efficient degranulation against all tested explants (n = 12). Additionally, NKG2D over-expression showed enhanced responses against 10 out of 12 explants. These results show that DNAM-1+ or NKG2D+ GM NK-92 cells may be an efficient approach in targeting sarcomas. The degranulation capacity of GM NK-92 cell lines was also tested against various established tumor cell lines, including neuroblastoma, Schwannoma, melanoma, myeloma, leukemia, prostate, pancreatic, colon, and lung cancer. Enhanced degranulation of DNAM-1+ or NKG2D+ GM NK-92 cells was observed against the majority of tumor cell lines tested. In conclusion, DNAM-1 or NKG2D over-expression elicited a dynamic increase in NK cell degranulation against all sarcoma explants and cancer cell lines tested, including those that failed to induce a notable response in WT NK-92 cells. These results support the broad therapeutic potential of DNAM-1+ or NKG2D+ GM NK-92 cells and GM human NK cells for the treatment of sarcomas and other malignancies.""","""['Ece Canan Sayitoglu', 'Anna-Maria Georgoudaki', 'Michael Chrobok', 'Didem Ozkazanc', 'Benjamin J Josey', 'Muhammad Arif', 'Kim Kusser', 'Michelle Hartman', 'Tamara M Chinn', 'Renee Potens', 'Cevriye Pamukcu', 'Robin Krueger', 'Cheng Zhang', 'Adil Mardinoglu', 'Evren Alici', 'Harry Thomas Temple', 'Tolga Sutlu', 'Adil Doganay Duru']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Front Immunol""","""['Identification and functional analysis of ligands for natural killer cell activating receptors in colon carcinoma.', 'The requirement for DNAM-1, NKG2D, and NKp46 in the natural killer cell-mediated killing of myeloma cells.', 'NK cells recognize and lyse Ewing sarcoma cells through NKG2D and DNAM-1 receptor dependent pathways.', 'Cancer immunotherapy using NKG2D and DNAM-1 systems.', 'NK cell recognition and killing of melanoma cells is controlled by multiple activating receptor-ligand interactions.', 'The Use of Targeted Cytokines as Cancer Therapeutics in Glioblastoma.', 'The apoptotic effects of NK-92 cells stimulated with an anti-CD226 antibody on MDA-MB-231 triple-negative breast cancer cells.', 'CAR-NK cell therapy for glioblastoma: what to do next?', 'ALPL-1 is a target for chimeric antigen receptor therapy in osteosarcoma.', 'Opportunities and challenges of natural killer cell-derived extracellular vesicles.']"""

It remains elusive whether post-translational modifications of transcription factors can differentially determine adult stem/progenitor cell fate. Here we report that, in human and mouse prostates, Klf5 is expressed in both basal and luminal cells, with basal cells preferentially expressing acetylated Klf5. Functionally, Klf5 is indispensable for maintaining basal progenitors, their luminal differentiation, and the proliferation of their basal and luminal progenies. Acetylated Klf5 is also essential for basal progenitors' maintenance and proper luminal differentiation, as deacetylation of Klf5 causes excess basal-to-luminal differentiation; attenuates androgen-mediated organoid organization; and retards postnatal prostate development. In basal progenitor-derived luminal cells, Klf5 deacetylation increases their proliferation and attenuates their survival and regeneration following castration and subsequent androgen restoration. Mechanistically, Klf5 deacetylation activates Notch signaling. Klf5 and its acetylation thus contribute to postnatal prostate development and regeneration by controlling basal progenitor cell fate.""","""['Baotong Zhang', 'Xinpei Ci', 'Ran Tao', 'Jianping Jenny Ni', 'Xiaoyan Xuan', 'Jamie L King', 'Siyuan Xia', 'Yixiang Li', 'Henry F Frierson', 'Dong-Kee Lee', 'Jianming Xu', 'Adeboye O Osunkoya', 'Jin-Tang Dong']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Nat Commun""","""['Different expression patterns and functions of acetylated and unacetylated Klf5 in the proliferation and differentiation of prostatic epithelial cells.', 'Roles of Klf5 Acetylation in the Self-Renewal and the Differentiation of Mouse Embryonic Stem Cells.', 'Stem Cell Antigen-1 Identifies a Distinct Androgen-Independent Murine Prostatic Luminal Cell Lineage with Bipotent Potential.', 'Essential role of KLF5 transcription factor in cell proliferation and differentiation and its implications for human diseases.', 'Prostate Luminal Progenitor Cells in Development and Cancer.', 'Nitazoxanide inhibits acetylated KLF5-induced bone metastasis by modulating KLF5 function in prostate cancer.', 'New insights into KLFs and SOXs in cancer pathogenesis, stemness, and therapy.', 'Targeting aldehyde dehydrogenase for prostate cancer therapies.', 'PTEN Protein Phosphatase Activity Is Not Required for Tumour Suppression in the Mouse Prostate.', 'Genetic determinants of chromatin reveal prostate cancer risk mediated by context-dependent gene regulation.']"""

However, the connection between natural killer (NK) cells and prostate cancer (PCa) has not been elucidated.  Methods:   Prospective data on NK cell activity (NKA) and NK cell subset distribution patterns were evaluated from 51 patients treated with robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy. Whole-blood samples were collected from patients preoperatively and 4-6 weeks postoperatively. The samples were subjected to NKA tests, NK cell number counts, determination of the NKG2D (activating receptor of NK cells), NKG2A (inhibiting receptor), and other surface markers. All the analyses were compared to the clinicopathological characteristics of patients. NKA was estimated by measuring interferon-γ (IFN-γ) levels after stimulation of the peripheral blood with PROMOCA™, which specifically stimulates the release of IFN-γ from NK cells.  Results:   NKA was lower in patients with PCa than in healthy participants (484.66 vs. 1550 pg/mL). A paired comparison revealed significantly higher NKA postoperatively than preoperatively (1054 vs. 484.66 pg/mL; p = 0.011). Patients with negative surgical margins exhibited significantly higher postoperative NKA and NKA ratio (postoperative NKA/preoperative NKA) than those with positive margins (557 vs. 1921 pg/mL, p < 0.001; 3.6 vs. 1.59, p = 0.024). However, there was no difference in the postoperative NK cell number or the CD56bright/CD16-/CD3- or CD56dim/CD16+/CD3- cell numbers between the negative and positive margin groups. Postoperative NKA was significantly higher in lower-stage (1/2) than in higher-stage (3/4) PCa (1365 vs. 594 pg/mL, p = 0.014).  Conclusion:   NKA was significantly higher postoperatively than preoperatively. Patients with positive surgical margins had lower postoperative NKA than those with negative margins. Lower postoperative NKA was also observed in higher-stage PCa. NKA could be used as a supplemental marker for detecting the remaining tumor cells after prostatectomy in combination of PSA.""","""['Yu-Chuan Lu', 'Ming-Chieh Kuo', 'Jian-Hua Hong', 'Fu-Shan Jaw', 'Chao-Yuan Huang', 'Jason Chia-Hsien Cheng', 'Hsiu-Ni Kung']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""J Formos Med Assoc""","""['Corrigendum to ""Lower postoperative natural killer cell activity is associated with positive surgical margins after radical prostatectomy"" J Formosan Med Assoc 119 (11) (November 2020), 1673-1683.', 'NKG2A and circulating extracellular vesicles are key regulators of natural killer cell activity in prostate cancer after prostatectomy.', 'Reduction of the CD16(-)CD56bright NK cell subset precedes NK cell dysfunction in prostate cancer.', 'Increased Peripheral NKG2A-NKG2D+CD3-CD16+CD56dim NK Cell Subset Was Positively Correlated with Antiphospholipid Antibodies in Patients of Obstetric Antiphospholipid Syndrome.', 'Increased natural killer cell subsets with inhibitory cytokines and inhibitory surface receptors in patients with recurrent miscarriage and decreased or normal subsets in kidney transplant recipients late post-transplant.', 'Role of chemokines in the biology of natural killer cells.', 'NKG2A and circulating extracellular vesicles are key regulators of natural killer cell activity in prostate cancer after prostatectomy.', 'Tumor immune contexture predicts recurrence after prostatectomy and efficacy of androgen deprivation and immunotherapy in prostate cancer.', 'Perioperative oncolytic virotherapy to counteract surgery-induced immunosuppression and improve outcomes in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.', 'Immunophenotype Rearrangement in Response to Tumor Excision May Be Related to the Risk of Biochemical Recurrence in Prostate Cancer Patients.']"""

We reviewed 1064 radical prostatectomy specimens and recorded Grade Group, pT-stage, margin status, Gleason pattern percentages, and growth patterns. Simple and complex glomerulations were distinguished by gland size and intraluminal cribriform protrusions. Clinical endpoint was biochemical recurrence-free survival. Glomerulations were identified in 365 (34%) specimens. In 472 Grade Group 2 patients, 210 (44%) had simple and 92 (19%) complex glomerulations. Complex glomerulations coincided with cribriform architecture more often than simple glomerulations (67% versus 52%; P = 0.01). Men with simple glomerulations had significantly lower prostate specific antigen (PSA) levels (9.7 versus 12.1 ng/ml; P = 0.03), percentage Gleason pattern 4 (19% versus 25%; P = 0.001), extra-prostatic extension (34% versus 50%; P = 0.01), and positive surgical margins (25% versus 39%; P = 0.04) than those with cribriform architecture. Extra-prostatic extension (37%) and positive surgical margins (30%) in men with complex glomerulations resembled those with simple glomeruloid rather than those with cribriform architecture.

Outcomes:   Progressive remission of carcinoma was observed along with reduction in PSA and Testosterone levels. PET CT showed decline in PSMA avidity by 50% with SUVmax -14.0 and normal size and shape of prostate gland.  Lessons:   Prostate carcinoma is the second most common cancer in men with majority of them exhibiting locally advanced disease. Apparently 20% to 30% of them are categorized as relapsed cases after various therapeutic interventions. Modulating immune system is an emerging therapy termed as Immunotherapy and potentiates the killing cancer cells via immune activation. Interestingly, prostate cancer is slow growing and it provides the scope and time to mount an anti-tumor response which makes it an attractive target for immunotherapy. This case study demonstrates the efficacy of APCEDEN Immunotherapy regimen resulting in a significant disease remission benefiting the patient.""","""['Bandana Sharan', 'Srikanth Chiliveru', 'Jasmine Bagga', 'Sakshi Kohli', 'Asmi Bharadwaj', 'Ashok K Vaid', 'Chaitanya Kumar']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Medicine (Baltimore)""","""['More advantages in detecting bone and soft tissue metastases from prostate cancer using 18F-PSMA PET/CT.', '68Ga-PSMA PET/CT in Patients with Rising Prostatic-Specific Antigen After Definitive Treatment of Prostate Cancer: Detection Efficacy and Diagnostic accuracy.', '68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT in primary staging of prostate cancer: PSA and Gleason score predict the intensity of tracer accumulation in the primary tumour.', 'The Impact of 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT and PET/MRI on the Management of Prostate Cancer.', 'Sipuleucel-T: APC 8015, APC-8015, prostate cancer vaccine--Dendreon.', 'Has the Landscape of Immunotherapy for Prostate Cancer Changed?

However, controversy still exists as to whether the operating surgeon's specialty has an impact on post-operative complication rates.  Patients and methods:   The 2007-2017 Humana Administrative Claims database was queried using Current Procedural Terminology codes to identify patients undergoing fusions, laminectomies or osteotomy/corpectomy for spinal metastases. Physician taxonomy codes were used to identify the operating surgeon's specialty (orthopaedic vs. neurosurgery). Multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to assess difference in 90-day complications, readmissions and mortality between the two specialties while controlling for age, gender, race, co-morbidity burden, procedural characteristics (fusion, laminectomy and/or osteotomy/corpectomy) and type of primary cancer.  Results:   A total of 887 patients undergoing surgical intervention for spinal metastases were included - out of which 204 (23.0 %) patients were operated on by orthopaedic surgeons and 683 (77.0 %) by neurosurgeons. Following adjustment for difference in patient demographics and baseline clinical characteristics, no statistically significant differences were noted between the two specialties with regards to wound complications (p = 0.992), pulmonary complications (p = 0.461), cardiac complications (p = 0.631), thrombotic complications (p = 0.177), sepsis (p = 0.463), pneumonia (p = 0.767), urinary tract infection (p = 0.916), acute renal failure (p = 0.934), hardware complications (p = 0.892), emergency department visits (p = 0.934), 90-day readmissions (p = 0.277) and 90-day mortality (p = 0.786).  Conclusions:   Based off our findings, it appears that a surgeon's specialty has no influence on intermediate-term complications following surgical intervention for spinal metastases. The findings of the study should support the need for maintaining access of patients to both specialties for appropriate surgical consultation.""","""['Azeem Tariq Malik', 'Jae Baek', 'John H Alexander', 'Safdar N Khan', 'Thomas J Scharschmidt']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Clin Neurol Neurosurg""","""['Orthopedic versus Neurosurgery-Understanding 90-Day Complications and Costs in Patients Undergoing Elective 1-Level to 2-Level Posterior Lumbar Fusions by Different Specialties.', 'Anterior Lumbar Fusion: Differences in Patient Selection and Surgical Outcomes Between Neurosurgeons and Orthopaedic Surgeons.', 'What Is the Value of Undergoing Surgery for Spinal Metastases at Dedicated Cancer Centers?', 'Development of a Metastatic Spinal Tumor Frailty Index (MSTFI) Using a Nationwide Database and Its Association with Inpatient Morbidity, Mortality, and Length of Stay After Spine Surgery.', 'Preoperative Urinary Tract Infection Increases Postoperative Morbidity in Spine Patients.', 'Trends in Utilization of Preoperative Embolization for Spinal Metastases: A Study of the National Inpatient Sample 2005-2017.']"""

The goal of this study was to identify types of lifestyle RCTs that may require improved recruitment resources to enhance generalizability of lifestyle recommendations to Black patients.  Materials and methods:   ClinicalTrials.gov was used to identify lifestyle RCTs among patients with prostate cancer. Using racial distribution data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program as a reference, one-sample proportion tests were performed to assess adequate recruitment of Black participants.  Results:   Of 31 lifestyle trials, one trial reported race-specific results. Proportion of Black participants was acquired from 26 trials. Compared to the US population, Black participants were overrepresented in the overall study population (17% versus 15%, p = 0.019). Black participants were underrepresented in trials exploring exercise interventions (9% versus 15%, p = 0.041), trials among patients with advanced disease (9% versus 16%, p < 0.001), and in university-funded trials (12% versus 15%, p = 0.026).  Conclusions:   The reporting of race data, and race-specific results when feasible, is essential for clinicians to accurately generalize findings from lifestyle trials. Additional resources may be necessary to aid in strategic recruitment of Black participants for trials on exercise interventions, trials among patients with advanced disease, and in university-funded trials.""","""['Kyle B Zuniga', 'Hala Borno', 'June M Chan', 'Erin L Van Blarigan', 'Terence W Friedlander', 'Sunny Wang', 'Li Zhang', 'Stacey A Kenfield']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""J Racial Ethn Health Disparities""","""['Minority recruitment in the prostate cancer prevention trial.', 'Minority Recruitment Trends in Phase III Prostate Cancer Clinical Trials (2003 to 2014): Progress and Critical Areas for Improvement.', 'Differences in the prevalence of modifiable risk and protective factors for prostate cancer by race and ethnicity in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey.', 'Access and Representation: A Narrative Review of the Disparities in Access to Clinical Trials and Precision Oncology in Black men with Prostate Cancer.', 'Racial differences in prostate cancer treatment outcomes: a systematic review.', 'Engaging Men of Diverse Racial and Ethnic Groups With Advanced Prostate Cancer in the Design of an mHealth Diet and Exercise Intervention: Focus Group Study.', 'Opportunities to Improve Long COVID Care: Implications from Semi-structured Interviews with Black Patients.', 'Accrual and retention of diverse patients in psychosocial cancer clinical trials.', 'Quality of Life of Prostate Cancer Survivors Participating in a Remotely Delivered Web-Based Behavioral Intervention Pilot Randomized Trial.']"""

Methods:   In this multicentre study, subjects scheduled for a radical prostatectomy underwent 2D CEUS imaging preoperatively. CUDI maps were generated from the CEUS recordings. Both CEUS recordings and CUDI maps were scored on the likelihood of presenting csPCa (any Gleason ≥ 4 + 3 and Gleason 3 + 4 larger than 0.5 mL) by five observers and compared to radical prostatectomy histopathology. An automated three-dimensional (3D) fusion protocol was used to match imaging with histopathology. Receiver operator curve (ROC) analysis was performed per observer and imaging modality.  Results:   133 of 216 (62%) patients were included in the final analysis. Average area under the ROC for all five readers for CEUS, CUDI and the combination was 0.78, 0.79 and 0.78, respectively. This yields a sensitivity and specificity of 81 and 64% for CEUS, 83 and 56% for CUDI and 83 and 55% for the combination. Interobserver agreement for CEUS, CUDI and the combination showed kappa values of 0.20, 0.18 and 0.18 respectively.  Conclusion:   The sensitivity and specificity of 2D CEUS and CUDI for csPCa localization are moderate. Despite compressing CEUS in one image, CUDI showed a similar performance to 2D CEUS.

The current study aimed to investigate the role and functions of SNHG1 in PCa cells. Materials and Methods: Abnormal expression of SNHG1, survival analysis, and target gene were determined or predicted by bioinformatics techniques. Gene expressions at transcriptional and translational levels were determined by Quantitative Real-time PCR and Western blotting, respectively. Cell viability, growth, and apoptosis rate were detected by Cell Counting Kit-8, colony formation assay and flow cytometry. Results: The results showed that SNHG1 was highly expressed in PCa tissues, which was accompanied by decreased miR-377-3p expression and poor overall survival rate, and that miR-377-3p was predicted as the target of SNHG1 in PCa cells. Moreover, SNHG1 counteracted the effects of miR-377-3p on inhibiting cell growth and promoting apoptosis of PCa cells. Furthermore, miR-377-3p counteracted the effects of AKT2 on promoting cell viability, growth, and suppressing apoptosis of PCa cells. In addition, AKT2 expression was proved to be regulated by miR-377-3p. Conclusions: The SNHG1/miR-377-3p/AKT2 regulatory axis in PCa cells was disclosed. The upregulated AKT2 might be a result of dysregulated interaction balance between the expressions of miR-377-3p and SNHG1. Based on such discoveries, the intervention of SNHG1/miR-377-3p/AKT2 axis could be further explored in the treatment of PCa.""","""['Mao Xie', 'Zhiyu Zhang', 'Yupeng Cui']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Cancer Biother Radiopharm""","""['Long non-coding TUG1 accelerates prostate cancer progression through regulating miR-128-3p/YES1 axis.', ""lncRNA SNHG1 Knockdown Alleviates Amyloid-β-Induced Neuronal Injury by Regulating ZNF217 via Sponging miR-361-3p in Alzheimer's Disease."", 'SNHG1 promotes MPP+-induced cytotoxicity by regulating PTEN/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway in SH-SY5Y cells via sponging miR-153-3p.', 'The Emerging Role of Non-Coding RNAs in Pituitary Gland Tumors and Meningioma.', 'A modern era of personalized medicine in the diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of prostate cancer.', 'Importance of long non-coding RNAs in the pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment of prostate cancer.', 'LOC554202 contributes to chordoma progression by sponging miR-377-3p and up-regulating SMAD3.', 'ceRNA network of lncRNA MIR210HG/miR-377-3p/LMX1A in malignant proliferation of glioma cells.', 'Integrative Analysis and Experimental Validation Indicated That SNHG17 Is a Prognostic Marker in Prostate Cancer and a Modulator of the Tumor Microenvironment via a Competitive Endogenous RNA Regulatory Network.', 'Targeting autophagy in prostate cancer: preclinical and clinical evidence for therapeutic response.']"""

We performed an external validation of this test in men undergoing initial prostate biopsy (Bx) within a Spanish opportunistic screening scenario.  Methods:   We analyzed archived samples from 492 men who underwent prostate Bx in an opportunistic screening scenario, with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) 3 to 10 ng/mL and/or suspicious digital rectal exploration (DRE) and without previous multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI). Urinary biomarker measurements were combined with clinical risk factors to determine a risk score, and accuracy for GG ≥ 2 PCa detection was compared with PCA3, European randomized screening in prostate cancer (ERSPC), and prostate biopsy collaborative group (PBCG) risk calculators in a validation workup that included calibration, discrimination, and clinical utility analysis.  Results:   In our cohort, the detection rates for GG1 and GG ≥ 2 PCa were 20.3% and 14.0%, respectively. The median PSA level was 3.9 ng/mL and 13.4% of subjects had suspicious DRE findings. The median risk score for men with GG ≥ 2 PCa was 21 (interquartile range: 14-28), significantly higher than benign+GG1 PCa (10, 6-18), P < .001, achieving the highest area under the curve among the models tested, 0.749 (95% confidence interval: 0.690-0.807). The urine test was well-calibrated, while ERSPC showed a slight underestimation and PBCG a slight overestimation of risk. Assuming a GG2 non-detection rate of 11% without using mpMRI, use of the urinary biomarker-based clinical model could have helped avoid 37.2% of excess biopsies while delaying the diagnosis of eight patients (1.6% of the entire cohort) with GG ≥ 2 PCa.  Conclusions:   In this first evaluation in an opportunistic screening population, the urinary biomarker-based test improved the detection of clinically significant PCa. Facing men with elevated PSA and/or suspicious DRE, it could be a useful tool to help avoid excess initial Bx and to identify patients most likely to benefit from Bx.""","""['Jose Rubio-Briones', 'Angel Borque-Fernando', 'Luis M Esteban', 'Juan M Mascarós', 'Miguel Ramírez-Backhaus', 'Juan Casanova', 'Argimiro Collado', 'Carmen Mir', 'Alvaro Gómez-Ferrer', 'Augusto Wong', 'Fuensanta Aragón', 'Ana Calatrava', 'Jose A López-Guerrero', 'Jack Groskopf', 'Jack Schalken', 'Wim Van Criekinge', 'Jose Domínguez-Escrig']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['PCA3 as a second-line biomarker in a prospective controlled randomized opportunistic prostate cancer screening programme.', 'Detection of High-grade Prostate Cancer Using a Urinary Molecular Biomarker-Based Risk Score.', 'Optimizing prostate cancer screening; prospective randomized controlled study of the role of PSA and PCA3 testing in a sequential manner in an opportunistic screening program.', 'Urinary Prostate Cancer Antigen 3 as a Tumour Marker: Biochemical and Clinical Aspects.', 'Multiparametric MRI in detection and staging of prostate cancer.', 'Increased Density of Growth Differentiation Factor-15+ Immunoreactive M1/M2 Macrophages in Prostate Cancer of Different Gleason Scores Compared with Benign Prostate Hyperplasia.', 'Accommodating heterogeneous missing data patterns for prostate cancer risk prediction.', 'SelectMDx and Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging of the Prostate for Men Undergoing Primary Prostate Biopsy: A Prospective Assessment in a Multi-Institutional Study.']"""

Salvage EBRT to the residual prostate was performed with moderate hypofractionation schedule (MHRT) in 28 fractions (n = 16) or with extreme hypofractionation schedule (SBRT) in 5 fractions (n = 8) by means of image-guided volumetric modulation arc therapy. In case of MHRT, the median dose was 71.4 Gy, whereas in case of SBRT it was 32.5 Gy.  Results:   The median follow-up was 28 months. The median PSA nadir was 0.26 ng/mL.

The aim of the present study was to compare IDP, with uncertainty, using Stan 2.18, Monolix 2018R2 and NONMEM 7.4. Simulations of biomarker and survival were performed using a nonlinear joint model of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) kinetics and survival in metastatic prostate cancer. Several scenarios were evaluated, according to the strength of the association between PSA and survival. For various landmark times, a posteriori distribution of PSA kinetic individual parameters was estimated, given individual observations, with each software. Samples of individual parameters were drawn from the posterior distribution. Bias and imprecision of individual parameters as well as coverage of 95% credibility interval for PSA and risk of death were evaluated. All software performed equally well with small biases on individual parameters. Imprecision on individual parameters was comparable across software and showed marked improvements with increasing landmark time. In terms of coverage, results were also comparable and all software were able to well predict PSA kinetics and survival. As for computing time, Stan was faster than Monolix and NONMEM to obtain individual parameters. Stan 2.18, Monolix 2018R2 and NONMEM 7.4 are able to characterize IDP of biomarkers and risk of event in a nonlinear joint modelling framework with correct uncertainty and hence could be used in the context of individualized medicine.""","""['François Riglet', 'France Mentre', 'Christine Veyrat-Follet', 'Julie Bertrand']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""AAPS J""","""['Nonlinear joint models for individual dynamic prediction of risk of death using Hamiltonian Monte Carlo: application to metastatic prostate cancer.', 'Nonlinear Mixed-effect Models for Prostate-specific Antigen Kinetics and Link with Survival in the Context of Metastatic Prostate Cancer: A Comparison by Simulation of Two-stage and Joint Approaches.', 'Improving the Specificity of Screening for Lethal Prostate Cancer Using Prostate-specific Antigen and a Panel of Kallikrein Markers: A Nested Case-Control Study.', 'Do prostate cancer risk models improve the predictive accuracy of PSA screening?

Design:   Retrospective analysis of a large prospective Uro-oncology registry of mPCa.  Setting:   This study is carried out in a tertiary hospital in Singapore.  Participants:   We reviewed our institution's prospectively maintained database of 685 patients with mPCa over a 20-year period (1995-2014). Patients with non-mPCa or those progressed to metastatic disease after previous curative local treatments were excluded.  Primary and secondary outcome measures:   The primary outcome was to evaluate the systemic and local morbidity rates associated with mPCa. Local complication was defined as the need for palliative procedures to relieve urinary obstruction, worsening renal function or refractory haematuria, while systemic complication was related to radiographic evidence of skeletal-related pathological fractures. Secondary outcomes analysed were the management and overall survival patterns over 20 years.  Results:   237 (34.6%) patients required local palliative treatments. 88 (12.8%) patients presented with acute urinary retention, 23 patients (9.7%) required repetitive local palliative treatments. On multivariate analyses, prostate-specific antigen >100 (p=0.02) and prostate volume >50 g (p=0.03) were independent prognostic factors for significant obstruction requiring palliative procedures. 118 (17.2%) patients developed skeletal fractures, with poor Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance (ECOG) status (p=0.01) and high volume bone metastasis (p<0.01) independently predictive of skeletal fractures. Altogether, 653 (95.3%) patients received androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), with the median time to castrate resistance of 21.4 months (IQR 7-27). The median overall survival was 45 months (IQR 20-63), with prostate cancer mortality of 81.4%. Improved overall survival was observed from 41.6 months (1995-1999) to 47.8 months (2010-2014) (p<0.01).

We performed a case-cohort study including incident cases of breast (n = 207), colorectal (n = 111), lung (n = 70), and prostate (n = 201) cancer as well as a subcohort (n = 465) within the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition-Heidelberg cohort. Relative counts of neutrophils, monocytes, and lymphocyte sublineages were measured by qRT-PCR. HRs and 95% confidence intervals were used to measure the associations between relative counts of immune cell and cancer risks. When relative counts of immune cell types were taken individually, a significant positive association was observed between relative counts of FOXP3+ regulatory T cells (Tregs) and lung cancer risk, and significant inverse associations were observed between relative CD8+ counts and risks of lung and breast cancer (overall and ER+ subtype). Multivariable models with mutual adjustments across immune markers showed further significant positive associations between higher relative FOXP3+ T-cell counts and increased risks of colorectal and breast cancer (overall and ER- subtype). No associations were found between immune cell composition and prostate cancer risk. These results affirm the relevance of elevated FOXP3+ Tregs and lower levels of cytotoxic (CD8+) T cells as risk factors for tumor development.

The criteria for ""active surveillance"" depend in part on quantification of tumor extent and grade on prostate biopsies. It is known that false-negative biopsies may occur from incomplete sectioning of cores within the paraffin blocks. Methods. We retrospectively analyzed a prostate biopsy series, which were subjected to a second round of sections, in order to determine the rate of missed cancers. Results. Of 1324 sets of prostate biopsies, 4.5% (60) showed additional involved cores or higher grade tumor on recut sections. In 27 patients (2.0%), the changed diagnosis resulted in a potential mild increase in National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) risk, from negative to very low (12), very low to low (12), and low to favorable intermediate (3). In 3 patients (0.2%), the changed diagnosis resulted in a significant increase in NCCN risk. Comparison of the initial sets of slides to the recuts demonstrated areas of absent tissue in many of the cases in which tumor segments were missed. In 2/3 cases with the significant grade increase, gaps were present in one that should have alerted the pathologist to incomplete sections, and the tumor was fragmented at the edge of the core appearing incompletely sampled. Conclusions. A significant increase in risk was seen in this study in 0.2% of patients when blocks were recut for further sampling, with minor increases in 2%. While embedding issues only rarely resulted in clinically significant sampling error, the 3 significantly underdiagnosed cases underscore the need for pathologists to be alert to incomplete sections of prostate cores.""","""['Adina T Paulk', 'Isabell A Sesterhenn', 'Allen P Burke']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Int J Surg Pathol""","""['Diagnostic effect of complete histologic sampling of prostate needle biopsy specimens.', 'Adequate histologic sectioning of prostate needle biopsies.', 'Magnetic resonance imaging-targeted, 3D transrectal ultrasound-guided fusion biopsy for prostate cancer: Quantifying the impact of needle delivery error on diagnosis.', 'Prostate needle biopsies containing prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia or atypical foci suspicious for carcinoma: implications for patient care.', 'Contemporary update on pathology-related issues on routine workup of prostate biopsy: sectioning, tumor extent measurement, specimen orientation, and immunohistochemistry.', 'Efficient 3D light-sheet imaging of very large-scale optically cleared human brain and prostate tissue samples.']"""

We report the clinical outcomes of 260 patients treated with high-dose IGRT as well as the toxicity of high-dose IGRT in these patients.  Materials and methods:   From September 2008 to February 2012, 260 men with clinically localized prostate cancer underwent radical radiotherapy. Two hundred patients were treated with IMRT (78 Gy in 39 fractions) to the prostate and base of seminal vesicles using an adaptive protocol combining cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) and kilovoltage image matching with individualized safety margin calculation. Sixty patients underwent treatment with the same prescribed dose using RapidArc with a reduced safety margin of 6 mm and daily online matching using CBCT. Late toxicity was scored prospectively according to the RTOG/FC-LENT scale.  Results:   Eighteen patients (6.9%) experienced acute grade 2 gastrointestinal toxicity. There was no acute grade 3 or 4 gastrointestinal toxicity. Thirty-nine patients (15%) experienced acute grade 2 genitourinary toxicity and 6 patients (2.3%) had grade 3 gerourinary toxicity. Genitourinary toxicity grade 4 was observed in 5 (1.9%) patients, due to installation of a urinary catheter. At a median follow up of 84.2 months, the estimated 7-year cumulative incidences of grade 2 gastrointestinal and genitourinary toxicity were 4.4 and 7.1% respectively. The estimated 7-year prostate specific antigen relapse free survival was 97.1% for low-risk disease, 83.6% for intermediate-risk disease and 75% for high-risk patients.  Conclusion:   The use of IMRT in combination with IGRT results in a low rate of late toxicity.

Chi-square tests and adjusted odds ratios from logistic regression models were computed to assess the association between residential location and cancer-related health behaviours including cancer screening participation, alcohol consumption, smoking, exercise, and fruit and vegetable intake, controlling for age, socio-economic status (SES), education, and place of birth. The findings show insufficient exercise, risky alcohol intake, meeting vegetable intake guidelines, and participation in cervical screening are more likely for those living in inner regional areas and in outer regional/remote areas compared with those living in major cities. Daily smoking and participation in prostate cancer screening were significantly higher for those living in outer regional/remote areas.

Recently, Asian countries are being affected by Western habits, which have had an important role in the rapid increase in cancer incidence. Sanggenol L (San L) is a natural flavonoid present in the root barks of Morus alba, which induces anti-cancer activities in ovarian cancer cells. However, the molecular and cellular mechanisms of the effects of sanggenol L on human prostate cancer cells have not been elucidated. In this study, we investigated whether sanggenol L exerts anti-cancer activity in human prostate cancer cells via apoptosis and cell cycle arrest. Sanggenol L induced caspase-dependent apoptosis (up-regulation of PARP and Bax or down-regulation of procaspase-3, -8, -9, Bid, and Bcl-2), induction of caspase-independent apoptosis (up-regulation of AIF and Endo G on cytosol), suppression of cell cycle (down-regulation of CDK1/2, CDK4, CDK6, cyclin D1, cyclin E, cyclin A, and cyclin B1 or up-regulation of p53 and p21), and inhibition of PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling (down-regulation of PI3K, p-Akt, and p-mTOR) in prostate cancer cells.

Furthermore, the development of drug resistant cancers makes the search for new anticancer lead compounds a priority. In this study, the extraction of an Ircinia sp. sponge resulted in the isolation of an inseparable mixture of (7E,12E,20Z)-variabilin (1) and (7E,12Z,20Z)-variabilin (2) and structural assignment was established using standard 1D and 2D NMR experiments. The cytotoxic activity of the compound against three solid tumour cell lines displayed moderate anti-cancer activity through apoptosis, together with a general lack of selectivity among the cancer cell lines studied. Structural assignment and cytotoxic evaluation of variabilin was complicated and further aggravated by its inherent instability. Variabilin was therefore incorporated into solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) and the stability and cytotoxic activity evaluated. Encapsulation of variabilin into SLNs led to a marked improvement in stability of the natural product coupled with enhanced cytotoxic activity, particularly against the prostate (PC-3) cancer cell line, with IC50 values of 87.74 μM vs. 8.94 μM for the variabilin alone and Var-SLN, respectively. Both variabilin and Var-SLN revealed comparable activity to Ceramide against the MCF-7 breast cancer cell line, revealing IC50 values of 34.8, 38.1 and 33.6 μM for variabilin, Var-SLN and Ceramide, respectively. These samples revealed no activity (>100 μM for all) against HT-29 (colon) cell lines and MCF-12 (normal breast) cell lines. Var-SLNs induced 47, 48 and 59% of apoptosis in HT-29, MCF-7 and PC-3 cells, respectively, while variabilin alone revealed 38, 29 and 29% apoptotic cells for HT-29, MCF-7 and PC-3 cell lines, respectively.

Methods to prevent PSMA-RNT-related xerostomia could be clinically useful; however, little is known about PSMA expression in salivary glands of preclinical animal models. Using [18F]DCFPyL autoradiography/biodistribution, PSMA expression levels were determined in salivary glands of various preclinical monkey and rodent species and compared with humans. Methods: Binding affinities (Kd) and PSMA levels (Bmax) were determined by in vitro [18F]DCFPyL autoradiography studies. In vivo rodent tissue uptakes (%ID/g) were determined from [18F]DCFPyL biodistributions. Results: [18F]DCFPyL exhibited low nanomolar Kd for submandibular gland (SMG) PSMA across all the species. PSMA levels in human SMG (Bmax = 60.91 nM) were approximately two-fold lower compared with baboon SMG but were two- to three-fold higher than SMG PSMA levels of cynomolgus and rhesus.

Materials and methods:   This population-based nationwide cohort study utilized data from the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database between 1997 and 2013. The patients were divided into three groups-those who received ADT only (ADT-only group), those who had radiotherapy (RT) only (RT-only group), and those treated with radical prostatectomy (RP) only (RP-only group). The study outcome was newly diagnosed hematologic disorder, including anemia and hematologic malignancy. Propensity score-matched, Cox regression, and Kaplan-Meier curve analyses were performed to investigate the risk of subsequently developing hematologic disorders after ADT.  Results:   Of the 17,168 patients with prostate cancer who were included in the study, 13,318 met the inclusion and exclusion criteria. After propensity score matching, 1,797, 1,797, and 1,797 patients treated with ADT only, RT only, and RP only, respectively, who had a median follow-up period of 4.32 years were included in the study cohort. Compared with the patients treated with RP only, those who received ADT and RT were significantly at increased risk of subsequently developing hematologic disorders (ADT: adjusted hazard ratio [aHR]: 1.60, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.29-1.97; RT: aHR, 1.98, 95% CI: 1.62-2.42) according to the Cox regression analysis. Based on the Kaplan-Meier curve analysis, patients with bone metastasis who received ADT only had the lowest cumulative probabilities of not developing hematologic disorders. Moreover, a significantly increased risk of hematologic disorders was observed with the increasing duration of ADT (P for trend < .001).  Conclusions:   The use of ADT in patients with prostate cancer may increase the risk of subsequently developing hematologic disorders.""","""['Jui-Ming Liu', 'Yueh-Ping Liu', 'Heng-Chang Chuang', 'Chun-Te Wu', 'Yu-Li Su', 'Ren-Jun Hsu']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Duration of Androgen Deprivation Therapy Influences Outcomes for Patients Receiving Radiation Therapy Following Radical Prostatectomy.', 'Is androgen deprivation therapy associated with cerebral infarction in patients with prostate cancer?

However, approximately a third of luminal urothelial carcinoma cases were up staged to nonorgan confined disease, and these may be under treated if neoadjuvant chemotherapy is withheld. In this study we trained a genomic classifier to predict luminal nonorgan confined disease in patients diagnosed with clinically organ confined (cT1/T2) disease.  Materials and methods:   Specimens from transurethral resected high grade cT1-T2N0M0 urothelial carcinoma of the bladder that belonged to the luminal subtype (Seiler 2017) were randomly split into training (75) and testing (25) sets for the development of a single sample luminal up staging classifier using lasso/ridge-penalized logistic regression. All patients underwent radical cystectomy without neoadjuvant chemotherapy and the primary end point was up staging to nonorgan confined disease. A radical cystectomy cohort and a platinum treated neoadjuvant chemotherapy cohort were used to evaluate the luminal up staging classifier.  Results:   Up staging to nonorgan confined disease occurred in 34% of luminal cases. The luminal up staging classifier predicted up staging in 32 of 34 cases, with 6 false-positives (AUC 0.96). The sensitivity for detection of luminal pN+ disease was 95% (20 of 21). Patients with predicted nonorgan confined luminal tumors had worse survival than those with organ confined luminal tumors (p=0.001). On multivariable analysis the luminal up staging classifier was a significant predictor of overall survival after adjusting for clinical variables available at transurethral resection. The luminal up staging classifier also predicted overall survival for aggressive luminal TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas) cases (n=83, p=0.043). In the neoadjuvant chemotherapy cohort the luminal up staging classifier predicted 9 up staging cases, all of which had excellent prognosis.  Conclusions:   A luminal up staging classifier was developed that distinguishes a subset of cT1-T2N0M0 luminal urothelial carcinoma cases at high risk for up staging to nonorgan confined disease at radical cystectomy and of death. Validation of this model in an independent, large patient cohort is necessary to determine how molecular stratification of luminal tumors could be used to guide treatment of these patients.""","""['Joep J de Jong', 'Yang Liu', 'Stephen A Boorjian', 'Trinity J Bivalacqua', 'Sima P Porten', 'Thomas Wheeler', 'Elai Davicioni', 'Robert S Svatek', 'Joost L Boormans', 'Peter C Black', 'Yair Lotan', 'Ewan A Gibb']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""J Urol""","""['Molecular Subtyping of Clinically Localized Urothelial Carcinoma Reveals Lower Rates of Pathological Upstaging at Radical Cystectomy Among Luminal Tumors.', 'A Prognostic Gene Expression Signature in the Molecular Classification of Chemotherapy-naïve Urothelial Cancer is Predictive of Clinical Outcomes from Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy: A Phase 2 Trial of Dose-dense Methotrexate, Vinblastine, Doxorubicin, and Cisplatin with Bevacizumab in Urothelial Cancer.', 'Lymphovascular invasion of urothelial cancer in matched transurethral bladder tumor resection and radical cystectomy specimens.', 'Analysis of 34 cases of infiltrating carcinoma of the bladder treated exclusively with partial cystectomy (part 1).', 'Upper urinary tract recurrence following radical cystectomy for bladder cancer: a meta-analysis on 13,185 patients.', 'The application value of multi-parameter cystoscope in improving the accuracy of preoperative bladder cancer grading.']"""

Methods:   This study analyzed data on cancer mortality in 39 hospitals in Tanzania. Data on the age and sex of the deceased and type of cancer were extracted from hospital death registers and report forms. Cancer types were grouped according to the 10th revision of the International Classification of Diseases. Age-standardized mortality rates and cancer mortality patterns were analyzed. A χ2 test was used to examine the association between common cancers and selected covariates.  Results:   A total of 12,621 cancer-related deaths occurred during the 10-year period, which translates to an age-standardized hospital-based mortality rate of 47.8 per 100,000 population. Overall, the number of deaths was notably higher (56.5%) among individuals in the 15- to 59-year-old age category and disproportionately higher among females than males (P = .0017). Cancers of the cervix, esophagus, and liver were the 3 major causes of death across all study hospitals in Tanzania. Cancers of the cervix, esophagus, and liver were the largest contributors to mortality burden among females. Among males, cancers of the esophagus, liver, and prostate were the leading cause of mortality.  Conclusion:   There is an increasing trend in cancer mortality over recent years in Tanzania, which differs with respect to age, sex, and geographic zones.

Subjects with metastatic disease or whose disease relapses after the initial therapy have a poor prognosis. Moreover, multifocal OST contains tumor-initiating cells that are resistant to chemotherapy. The use of aggressive therapies in an attempt to eradicate these cells can have long-term negative consequences in these vulnerable patient populations. 227Th-labeled molecular probes based on ligands to OST-associated receptors such as IGF-1R (insulin-like growth factor receptor 1), HER2 (human epidermal growth factor receptor 2), and PSMA (prostate-specific membrane antigen) are expected to detect and treat osseous and nonosseous sites of multifocal OST. Published reports indicate that 227Th has limited myelotoxicity, can be stably chelated to its carriers and, as it decays at targeted sites, 227Th produces 223Ra that is subsequently incorporated into the areas of increased osteoblastic activity, that is, osseous metastatic lesions. Linear energy transfer of α particles emitted by 227Th and its daughter 223Ra is within the range of the optimum relative biological effectiveness. The radiotoxicity of α particles is virtually independent of the phase in the cell cycle, oxygenation, and the dose rate. For these reasons, even resistant OST cells remain susceptible to killing by high-energy α particles, which can also kill adjacent quiescent OST cells or cells with low expression of targeted receptors. Systemic side effects are minimized by the limited range of these intense radiations. Quantitative single-photon emission computed tomography of 227Th and 223Ra is feasible. Additionally, the availability of radionuclide pairs, for example, 89Zr for positron emission tomography and 227Th for therapy, establish a strong basis for the theranostic use of 227Th in the individualized treatment of multifocal OST.""","""['Janina Baranowska-Kortylewicz', 'John G Sharp', 'Timothy R McGuire', 'Shantharam Joshi', 'Don W Coulter']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Cancer Biother Radiopharm""","""['More advantages in detecting bone and soft tissue metastases from prostate cancer using 18F-PSMA PET/CT.', 'Alpha Particle Radium 223 Dichloride in High-risk Osteosarcoma: A Phase I Dose Escalation Trial.', 'Targeted Alpha Therapy and Nanocarrier Approach.', 'Targeted Alpha Therapy: Current Clinical Applications.', 'Preclinical Efficacy of a PSMA-Targeted Thorium-227 Conjugate (PSMA-TTC), a Targeted Alpha Therapy for Prostate Cancer.']"""

Methods:   Patients were screened for delirium signs 15, 30, 45, and 60 minutes following extubation.

Very little is known about its functional effects on growth, angiogenesis, and epigenetic activities of human first trimester placenta. HTR8/SVneo trophoblasts cells were used as model for human first trimester placenta. Effects of curcumin (≥80%) in these cells were investigated using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT), radioactive thymidine uptake, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), promoter DNA methylation, qRT-PCR array, tube formation, wound healing, and immunoblot assays. PC3 (prostate cancer), JEG-3 (trophoblast), and HMEC-1 (endothelial) cells were used as control in various experiments. Unlike in PC3 cells, curcumin stimulated growth, proliferation, and viability in HTR8/SVneo cells. Curcumin increased tube formation, and messenger RNA (mRNA) expression of angiogenic factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA) and protein expression of proangiogenic factor VEGF receptor-2 and fatty acid-binding protein-4 (FABP4) in these cells. Curcumin-stimulated tube formation was associated with an increased expression of VEGFR2 and FABP4. The stimulatory effects of curcumin were inhibited by VEGFR2 (SU5416) and FABP4 (BMS309403) inhibitors. Curcumin also significantly increased both mRNA and protein expression of HLA-G in HTR8/SVneo cells. Curcumin increased mRNA expression of DNMT3A and NOTCH signaling system whereas down-regulated mRNA expression of HSD11β2. Curcumin enhanced hypomethylation of gene promoters against oxidative stress and DNA damage pathway mediators. Curcumin promotes cell growth, migration, and thus angiogenic potential of these cells. Increased expression of HLA-G by curcumin, hitherto unknown, is a novel finding since HLA-G not only favors the immune environment for invasive trophoblasts but also positively modulates angiogenesis.""","""['Sanjay Basak', 'Vilasagaram Srinivas', 'Aswani Mallepogu', 'Asim K Duttaroy']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Cell Biol Int""","""['Tube formation in the first trimester placental trophoblast cells: Differential effects of angiogenic growth factors and fatty acids.', 'Cellular growth and tube formation of HTR8/SVneo trophoblast: effects of exogenously added fatty acid-binding protein-4 and its inhibitor.', 'Connective tissue growth factor induces tube formation and IL-8 production in first trimester human placental trophoblast cells.', 'Maternal dietary fatty acids and their roles in human placental development.', 'Fatty acid-induced angiogenesis in first trimester placental trophoblast cells: possible roles of cellular fatty acid-binding proteins.', 'Identification of a novel 5-methylcytosine-related signature for prognostic prediction of kidney renal papillary cell carcinoma and a Putative target for drug repurposing.', 'The Role of Dietary Polyphenols in Pregnancy and Pregnancy-Related Disorders.', 'Inflammation in Preeclampsia: Genetic Biomarkers, Mechanisms, and Therapeutic Strategies.', 'Improvement of Glycaemia and Endothelial Function by a New Low-Dose Curcuminoid in an Animal Model of Type 2 Diabetes.', 'The Role of Syncytin in Placental Angiogenesis and Fetal Growth.']"""

We here provide a model for the dysregulation of the Endo180 network to demonstrate its vital contribution to bone destruction as well as tumour cell growth. The model consisted of a set of ordinary differential equations and reconstructed variations in the bone cells, resultant bone volume, and biochemical factors involved in the TGFβ-TGFβR-SMAD2/3 signalling pathway over time. The model also investigated the underlying mechanism in which the change of TGFβ affects the TGFβ-TGFβR-SMAD2/3 signalling pathway and the resultant Endo180 expression in osteoblastic and tumour cells. The model links the appearance of tumour cells with the inhibition of TGFβ binding to its receptors on osteoblastic cells, to affect TGFβ-TGFβR-SMAD2/3 signalling and Endo180 expression. Temporal variation in bone cells, bone volume, and the biochemical factors involved in the TGFβ-TGFβR-SMAD2/3 pathway as demonstrated in the model simulations agree with published experimental data. The model can be refined based on further discoveries but allows the influence of Endo180 network dysregulation on bone remodelling in MBD to be established.

We conducted a two-phase analysis for associations between genetic variants in the ketone metabolism pathway genes and survival of nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) by analyzing genotyping data from two published genome-wide association studies (GWASs). In the discovery, we used a genotyping dataset from the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial in the multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression analysis. We used Bayesian false discovery probability (≤0.80) for multiple testing correction to evaluate associations between 25,819 (2,176 genotyped and 23,643 imputed) single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 162 genes and survival of 1,185 NSCLC patients. Subsequently, we validated the identified significant SNPs with an additional 984 NSCLC patients from the Harvard Lung Cancer Susceptibility GWAS study. Finally, we found that three independent and potentially functional SNPs in three different genes (i.e., PLIN2 rs7867814 G>A, SULT2A1 rs2547235 C>T and UGT1A9 rs2011404 C>T) were independently associated with risk of death from NSCLC, with a combined hazards ratio of 1.22 [95% confidence interval = 1.09-1.36 and p = 0.0003], 0.82 (0.74-0.91 and p = 0.0002) and 1.21 (1.10-1.33 and p = 0.0001), respectively. Additional expression quantitative trait loci analysis found that the survival-associated PLIN2 rs7867814 GA + AA genotypes, but not the genotypes of other two SNPs, were significantly associated with increased mRNA expression levels (p = 0.005).

However, the relationship between erectile function and sexual distress has yet to be carefully examined. This study had three goals: (1) examine the relationship between erectile function and sexual distress; (2) determine groups of men based on erectile function and sexual distress; and (3) examine the psychosexual characteristics of these groups. A cross section of 233 sexually active men after PCa treatment (age M = 64.90 years, SD = 7.50) completed an online survey containing demographic, health, and sexuality and relationship questionnaires. The relationship between erectile function and sexual distress was curvilinear. Four groups of men were found: good erectile function and low sexual distress, poor erectile function and high sexual distress, but also good erectile function yet high sexual distress, and poor erectile function and low sexual distress. Regardless of erectile function, men with greater sexual distress were more depressed, reported additional sexual concerns, placed less value on sex, were less sexually satisfied, and used protective buffering communication more frequently. They were also less likely to be satisfied with their adaptation to sexual changes and less likely to have found a solution to those changes. The relationship between erectile function and sexual distress is complex, characterized by a wide array of responses to erectile function (high and low distress) and multiple correlates of sexual distress. These results broaden the concept of sexual recovery after PCa treatment, which may assist clinicians and researchers to better address sexual problems after PCa treatment.""","""['Lauren M Walker', 'Pablo Santos-Iglesias']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Arch Sex Behav""","""['Threat of Sexual Disqualification: The Consequences of Erectile Dysfunction and Other Sexual Changes for Gay and Bisexual Men With Prostate Cancer.', 'Health-Related Quality of Life, Psychological Distress, and Sexual Changes Following Prostate Cancer: A Comparison of Gay and Bisexual Men with Heterosexual Men.', 'Loss of masculine identity, marital affection, and sexual bother in men with localized prostate cancer.', 'A biopsychosocial approach to sexual recovery after prostate cancer surgery: the role of grief and mourning.', 'Prevention and management of postprostatectomy sexual dysfunctions part 2: recovery and preservation of erectile function, sexual desire, and orgasmic function.', 'Sexual satisfaction in prostate cancer: a multi-group comparison study of treated patients, patients under active surveillance, patients with negative biopsy, and controls.', 'Do colorectal cancer patients with a postoperative stoma have sexual problems?

Methods:   EBCD was utilised for this study. Patients, support persons and health professionals were selectively identified and recruited from two metropolitan health services in Melbourne. Selection criteria included (i) recent clinical/patient experience with prostate cancer treatment and (ii) willingness to share positive experiences and challenges in two 2-hour face-to-face workshops. Findings from these workshops were thematically analysed to identify key themes addressing aims of the study.  Results:   Twenty participants including eight patients, one support person and 11 health professionals were recruited. Four key touchpoints were identified. All participants acknowledged positive interactions between patients and health professionals. Patients often described the journey as lonely, stressful and frustrating especially prior to commencement of treatment. A lack of a consistent approach in identifying and preparing patients with prostate cancer for treatment was identified. A structured prehabilitation program was proposed as a solution. Practical ideas to be implemented including timing of commencement, educational content and strategies to boost engagement were formulated.  Conclusions:   The findings from the study provided practical guidance for future clinicians when implementing a prehabilitation program. Future study is required to evaluate the effectiveness of such a prehabilitation program in improving patient engagement and preparedness for prostate cancer treatment.""","""['Clarice Y Tang', 'Monica Turczyniak', 'Alesha Sayner', 'Kimberley Haines', 'Sally Butzkueven', ""Helen E O'Connell""]""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Support Care Cancer""","""['Development of a Prehabilitation Multimodal Supportive Care Interventions for Men and Their Partners Before Radical Prostatectomy for Localized Prostate Cancer.', 'Prehabilitation for men undergoing radical prostatectomy: a multi-centre, pilot randomized controlled trial.', ""Health professionals' experience of teamwork education in acute hospital settings: a systematic review of qualitative literature."", ""Patients' perspectives of prehabilitation as an extension of Enhanced Recovery After Surgery protocols."", 'Prostate Cancer Prehabilitation and the Importance of Multimodal Interventions for Person-centred Care and Recovery.', 'Co-designing psychosis simulated patient scenarios with mental health stakeholders for pharmacy curricula.', 'Co-design of a cancer nutrition care pathway by patients, carers, and health professionals: the CanEAT pathway.', 'Studying both patient and staff experience to investigate their perceptions and to target key interactions to improve: a scoping review.', 'Updates on enhanced recovery after surgery for radical cystectomy.', 'A Cancer Exercise Toolkit Developed Using Co-Design: Mixed Methods Study.']"""

The diagnoses were confirmed by the postoperative pathological examinations in all the patients. The CT imaging data of all patients were retrospectively reviewed and analyzed by two readers in consensus. Imaging characteristics related to the parotid neoplasms were extracted and quantified. Based on comprehensive analysis of the imaging characteristics, the probabilities of the benign and malignant neoplasms were evaluated and classified into six grades, PI-RADS 1-6 (PI-RADS 1: normal parotid gland; PI-RADS 2: confidently benign lesions; PI-RADS 3: probably benign lesions without confirmed evidence of malignancy; PI-RADS 4: suspected malignancy without sufficient evidence of malignancy; PI-RADS 5: confidently malignant lesions; PI-RADS 6: lesions with confirmed pathological evidence of malignancy).  Results:   A total of 897 patients with 1 003 parotid lesions were included. The lesions included 905 benign and 98 malignant lesions.

Methods:   Epigenome-wide DNA methylation profiling was performed in surgically resected primary tumor tissues from two cohorts of PCa patients with clinically localized disease who underwent radical prostatectomy (RP) as primary therapy and were followed prospectively for at least 5 years: (1) a Fred Hutchinson (FH) Cancer Research Center-based cohort (n = 323 patients); and (2) an Eastern Virginia (EV) Medical School-based cohort (n = 78 patients). CNAs were identified using the R package ChAMP. Metastasis was confirmed by positive bone scan, MRI, CT or biopsy, and death certificates confirmed cause of death.  Results:   We detected 15 recurrent CNAs were associated with metastasis in the FH cohort and replicated in the EV cohort (p < 0.05) without adjusting for Gleason score in the model. Eleven of the recurrent CNAs were associated with metastatic progression in the FH cohort and validated in the EV cohort (p < 0.05) when adjusting for Gleason score.

We investigated whether other prostate tumors that do not harbor deleterious mutations in these particular genes can similarly be deficient in HR, likely rendering those sensitive to HR-directed therapies.  Experimental design:   Homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) levels can be estimated using various mutational signatures derived from next-generation sequencing data. We used this approach on whole-genome sequencing (WGS; n = 311) and whole-exome sequencing (WES) data (n = 498) of both primary and metastatic prostate adenocarcinomas to determine whether prostate cancer cases display clear signs of HRD in somatic tumor biopsies.  Results:   Known BRCA-deficient samples showed all previously described HRD-associated mutational signatures in the WGS data. HRD-associated mutational signatures were also detected in a subset of patients who did not harbor germline or somatic mutations in BRCA1/2 or other HR-related genes. Similar results, albeit with lower sensitivity and accuracy, were also obtained from WES data.  Conclusions:   These findings may expand the number of cases likely to respond to PARP inhibitor treatment.

An unusual but unique environment for studying tumor cell processes is provided by microgravity, either in space or simulated by ground-based devices like a random positioning machine (RPM). In this study, prostate adenocarcinoma-derived PC-3 cells were cultivated on an RPM for time periods of 3 and 5 days. We investigated the genes associated with the cytoskeleton, focal adhesions, extracellular matrix, growth, survival, angiogenesis, and metastasis. The gene expression of signaling factors of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), and PI3K/AKT/mTOR (PAM) pathways was investigated using qPCR. We performed immunofluorescence to study the cytoskeleton, histological staining to examine the morphology, and a time-resolved immunofluorometric assay to analyze the cell culture supernatants. When PC-3 cells were exposed to simulated microgravity (s-µg), some cells remained growing as adherent cells (AD), while most cells detached from the cell culture flask bottom and formed multicellular spheroids (MCS). After 3-day RPM exposure, PC-3 cells revealed significant downregulation of the VEGF, SRC1, AKT, MTOR, and COL1A1 gene expression in MCS, whereas FLT1, RAF1, MEK1, ERK1, FAK1, RICTOR, ACTB, TUBB, and TLN1 mRNAs were not significantly changed. ERK2 and TLN1 were elevated in AD, and FLK1, LAMA3, COL4A5, FN1, VCL, CDH1, and NGAL mRNAs were significantly upregulated in AD and MCS after 3 days. After a 5-day culture in s-µg, the PC-3 cells showed significant downregulations of VEGF mRNA in AD and MCS, and FN1, CDH1, and LAMA3 in AD and SCR1 in MCS. In addition, we measured significant upregulations in FLT1, AKT, ERK1, ERK2, LCN2, COL1A1, TUBB, and VCL mRNAs in AD and MCS, and increases in FLK1, FN1, and COL4A5 in MCS as well as LAMB2, CDH1, RAF1, MEK1, SRC1, and MTOR mRNAs in AD. FAK1 and RICTOR were not altered by s-µg. In parallel, the secretion rate of VEGFA and NGAL proteins decreased. Cytoskeletal alterations (F-actin) were visible, as well as a deposition of collagen in the MCS. In conclusion, RPM-exposure of PC-3 cells induced changes in their morphology, cytoskeleton, and extracellular matrix protein synthesis, as well as in their focal adhesion complex and growth behavior. The significant upregulation of genes belonging to the PAM pathway indicated their involvement in the cellular changes occurring in microgravity.""","""['Trine Engelbrecht Hybel', 'Dorothea Dietrichs', 'Jayashree Sahana', 'Thomas J Corydon', 'Mohamed Z Nassef', 'Markus Wehland', 'Marcus Krüger', 'Nils E Magnusson', 'Johann Bauer', 'Kirsten Utpatel', 'Manfred Infanger', 'Daniela Grimm', 'Sascha Kopp']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Int J Mol Sci""","""['Long-Term Simulation of Microgravity Induces Changes in Gene Expression in Breast Cancer Cells.', 'Alterations of Growth and Focal Adhesion Molecules in Human Breast Cancer Cells Exposed to the Random Positioning Machine.', 'Reduced Expression of Cytoskeletal and Extracellular Matrix Genes in Human Adult Retinal Pigment Epithelium Cells Exposed to Simulated Microgravity.', 'The Fight against Cancer by Microgravity: The Multicellular Spheroid as a Metastasis Model.', 'The Impact of Spaceflight and Simulated Microgravity on Cell Adhesion.', 'Harnessing male germline epigenomics for the genetic improvement in cattle.', 'YAP Inhibition Alleviates Simulated Microgravity-Induced Mesenchymal Stem Cell Senescence via Targeting Mitochondrial Dysfunction.', 'Current Knowledge about the Impact of Microgravity on Gene Regulation.', ""Let's Go 3D!

In this regard, the functional characterization of microRNAs, molecules shown to regulate a number of cancer-related pathways, is instrumental to their possible clinical exploitation. Here, we demonstrate the tumor-suppressive role of the so far uncharacterized miR-1272, which we found to be significantly down-modulated in PCa clinical specimens compared to normal tissues. Through a gain-of-function approach using miRNA mimics, we showed that miR-1272 supplementation in two PCa cell models (DU145 and 22Rv1) reverted the mesenchymal phenotype by affecting migratory and invasive properties, and reduced cell growth in vitro and in vivo in SCID mice. Additionally, by targeting HIP1 encoding the endocytic protein HIP1, miR-1272 balanced EGFR membrane turnover, thus affecting the downstream AKT/ERK pathways, and, ultimately, increasing PCa cell response to ionizing radiation. Overall, our results show that miR-1272 reconstitution can affect several tumor traits, thus suggesting this approach as a potential novel therapeutic strategy to be pursued for PCa, with the multiple aim of reducing tumor growth, enhancing response to radiotherapy and limiting metastatic dissemination.""","""['Federica Rotundo', 'Denis Cominetti', 'Rihan El Bezawy', 'Stefano Percio', 'Valentina Doldi', 'Monica Tortoreto', 'Valentina Zuco', 'Riccardo Valdagni', 'Nadia Zaffaroni', 'Paolo Gandellini']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Cells""","""['miR-205 enhances radiation sensitivity of prostate cancer cells by impairing DNA damage repair through PKCε and ZEB1 inhibition.', 'miR-221-5p regulates proliferation and migration in human prostate cancer cells and reduces tumor growth in vivo.', 'MicroRNA-466 inhibits tumor growth and bone metastasis in prostate cancer by direct regulation of osteogenic transcription factor RUNX2.', 'miR-199a-3p targets stemness-related and mitogenic signaling pathways to suppress the expansion and tumorigenic capabilities of prostate cancer stem cells.', 'Oncogenic miR-210-3p promotes prostate cancer cell EMT and bone metastasis via NF-κB signaling pathway.', 'Hypoxia-induced Circular RNA hsa_circ_0006508 Promotes the Warburg Effect in Colorectal Cancer Cells.', 'Functional Screen for microRNAs Suppressing Anchorage-Independent Growth in Human Cervical Cancer Cells.', 'The Influence of miRNAs on Radiotherapy Treatment in Prostate Cancer - A Systematic Review.', 'MicroRNAs as Epigenetic Determinants of Treatment Response and Potential Therapeutic Targets in Prostate Cancer.', 'miRNAs as Therapeutic Tools and Biomarkers for Prostate Cancer.']"""

Methods and materials:   Participants with locally advanced prostate cancer in the TROG 03.04 RADAR trial were randomized to 6 or 18 months AS ± 18 months zoledronic acid (Z). The trial incorporated a RDE program by stratification at randomization and dosing options were 66, 70, or 74 Gy external beam radiation therapy (EBRT), or 46 Gy EBRT plus high-dose-rate brachytherapy boost (HDRB). The primary endpoint for this study was distant progression (DP). Secondary endpoints included local progression, bone progression, prostate cancer-specific mortality and all-cause mortality. Effect estimates for AS duration and RDE were derived using Fine and Gray competing risk models adjusting for use of Z, age, tumor stage, Gleason grade group, prostate-specific antigen, and treatment center. Cumulative incidence at 10 years was estimated for each RDE group.  Results:   A total of 1051 out of 1071 randomized subjects were eligible for inclusion in this analysis. Compared with 6 months AS, 18 months AS significantly reduced DP independently of radiation dose (subhazard ratio 0.70; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.56-0.87; P = .002). No statistically significant interaction between effect of AS duration and RT dose was observed (Wald test P = .76). In subgroup analyses, DP was significantly reduced by the longer duration of AS in the 70 Gy and HDRB groups but not in the 66 Gy and 74 Gy. Compared with 70 Gy, HDRB significantly reduced DP (subhazard ratio 0.68 [95% CI, 0.57-0.80]; P < .0001) independently of AS duration. At 10 years, adjusted cumulative incidences were 26.1% (95% CI, 18.9%-33.2%), 26.7% (22.9%-30.6%), 24.9% (20.0%-29.8%) and 19.7% (15.5%-23.8%) for DPs in the respective radiation dose groups.  Conclusions:   Compared with 6 months AS, 18 months AS reduced DP independently of radiation dose. Men treated with HDRB gained a significant benefit from a longer duration of AS.

Although cephalostatin 1 is a highly effective anticancer drug, its availability limits its utilization. We previously reported the synthesis of two 12'α-hydroxy derivatives of cephalostatin 1 that induce cell death by activating the ER stress apoptosis signaling pathway. For the current work, we synthesized six C11-functionalized cephalostatin 1 analogues (CAs) to evaluate their biological activity. For the cytotoxic compounds, the induced apoptotic pathway was investigated. The C11-functionalized cephalostatin 1 analogues 5 and 6 (CA5 and CA6) were found to exhibit cytotoxic activity against K-562 leukemia cells, MCF-7 breast cancer cells and DU-145 prostate cancer cells, while the remaining four analogues did not show anti-tumor activities against any of the cell lines. Our results indicated that CA5 and CA6 induced cell death via the atypical ER-dependent apoptosis pathway; they increased the expression of Smac/DIABLO, an inhibitor of inhibitors of apoptosis (IAPs), which in turn facilitated the activation of different caspases including the ER-caspase 4 without cytochrome c release from mitochondria. CA5 and CA6 are promising anticancer agents due to their low GI50, the remarkable apoptosis pathway they induce which can overcome chemoresistance, and their very low toxicity to normal cells making them cephalostatin 1 utilizable alternatives.""","""['Mansour M Nawasreh', 'Elham I Alzyoud', 'Zainab A Al-Mazaydeh', 'Majdoleen S Rammaha', 'Salem R Yasin', 'Lubna H Tahtamouni']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Steroids""","""['Cephalostatin 1 analogues activate apoptosis via the endoplasmic reticulum stress signaling pathway.', 'Cephalostatin 1 selectively triggers the release of Smac/DIABLO and subsequent apoptosis that is characterized by an increased density of the mitochondrial matrix.', 'Cephalostatin analogues--synthesis and biological activity.', 'Synthesis of a new cytotoxic cephalostatin/ritterazine analogue from hecogenin and 22-epi-hippuristanol.', 'The cephalostatin way of apoptosis.', 'The endoplasmic reticulum stress response in prostate cancer.']"""

However, there are no established data on perioperative outcomes comparing single-port to multi-port robotic approaches to robot-assisted radical prostatectomy.  Materials and methods:   All patients who underwent robot-assisted radical prostatectomy by 2 urological surgeons at our institution between October 2018 and June 2019 were retrospectively reviewed.

Immunohistochemical staining for NSD2 was carried out on specimen obtained from palliative resection of the prostate. Univariable and multivariable analyses were performed to assess the association between NSD2 expression and PCa progression.Results: Of the 53 patients, 41 had castration-resistant PCa and 48 men had metastases at time of tissue acquisition. NSD2 expression was increased in tumour specimen from 42 patients (79.2%). In univariable Cox regression analyses, NSD2 expression was associated with PSA progression, progression on imaging and overall survival (p = 0.04, respectively). In multivariable analyses, NSD2 expression did not retain its association with these endpoints.Conclusions: NSD2 expression is abnormal in almost 80% of patients with advanced PCa.

In this work, we report a two-phase miRNA biosensing strategy based on a modular framework nucleic acid (FNA) platform, which combines the high efficiency of homogeneous reaction and the convenience of heterogeneous biosensing. In the first phase, free DNA probes bind target miRNAs in a homogeneous solution, forming a DNA-RNA complex with high base stacking energy. Then, at the second phase, the universal FNA interface on the electrode selectively mediated the transition of the complex from the solution onto the interface for electrochemical signal generating and transduction. By applying this method, we detected as few as 1 aM of miR-141, a cancer marker miRNA, without the need for nucleic acid amplification. The dynamic range spans 10 orders of magnitude. We demonstrate multiplex miRNA detection and discrimination of highly homologous miRNAs with mismatches as few as a single base. We also show that this system can detect miR-141 in only 50 ng of total RNA samples from real cells, which allows discrimination of prostate cancer cells with normal cells.

This study examined the patterns and correlates of meeting ACS PA recommendations in the Detroit Research on Cancer Survivors (ROCS) cohort of African American cancer survivors.  Methods:   Detroit ROCS participants completed baseline and yearly follow-up surveys to update their health and health behaviors, including PA. This study examined participation in PA by select characteristics and reported health-related quality of life (HRQOL) as measured with the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy and Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System instruments.  Results:   Among the first 1500 ROCS participants, 60% reported participating in regular PA, with 24% reporting ≥150 min/wk. Although there were no differences by sex, prostate cancer survivors were the most likely to report participating in regular PA, whereas lung cancer survivors were the least likely (P = .022). Survivors who reported participating in regular PA reported higher HRQOL (P < .001) and lower depression (P = .040).  Conclusions:   Just 24% of African American cancer survivors reported meeting the ACS guidelines for PA at the baseline, but it was encouraging to see increases in activity over time.

Both tumors often show overexpression of prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA). In prostate cancer, PSMA-ligands labeled with 68Ga or 177Lu are used for imaging and therapy, respectively. Primary aim of this study in R/M ACC and SDC patients was to systematically investigate 68Ga-PSMA-uptake by PET/CT imaging to determine if PSMA radionuclide therapy could be a treatment option. Methods: In a prospective phase II study, PET/CT imaging was performed 1 h post injection of 68Ga-PSMA-HBED-CC in 15 ACC patients and 10 SDC patients. Maximum standardized uptake values (SUV) were determined in tumor lesions. Immunohistochemical PSMA expression was scored in primary tumors and metastatic tissue. Standard imaging (MRI or CT) was performed for comparison. Results: In ACC patients, SUVmax ranged from 1.1 to 30.2 with a tumor/liver-ratio >1 in 13 out of 14 evaluable patients (93%). In SDC patients, SUVmax ranged from 0.3 to 25.9 with a tumor/liver-ratio >1 in 4 out of 10 patients (40%). We found a large intra-patient inter-metastatic variation in uptake of 68Ga-PSMA, and immunohistochemistry did not predict ligand uptake in ACC and SDC. Finally, PSMA-PET detected additional bone metastases compared to CT in 2 ACC patients with unexplained pain. Conclusion: In 93% of ACC patients and 40% of SDC patients we detected relevant PSMA-ligand uptake, which warrants to study PSMA radionuclide therapy in these patients. Additionally, our data provide arguments for patient selection and treatment timing.

Methods: We describe the development of Anticalin proteins based on the lipocalin 2 (Lcn2) scaffold against the human CD98hc ectodomain (hCD98hcED) using directed evolution and protein design. X-ray structural analysis was performed to identify the epitope recognized by the lead Anticalin candidate. The Anticalin - with a tuned plasma half-life using PASylation® technology - was labeled with 89Zr and investigated by positron emission tomography (PET) of CD98-positive tumor xenograft mice. Results: The Anticalin P3D11 binds CD98hc with picomolar affinity and recognizes a protruding loop structure surrounded by several glycosylation sites within the solvent exposed membrane-distal part of the hCD98hcED. In vitro studies revealed specific binding activity of the Anticalin towards various CD98hc-expressing human tumor cell lines, suggesting broader applicability in cancer research. PET/CT imaging of mice bearing human prostate carcinoma xenografts using the optimized and 89Zr-labeled Anticalin demonstrated strong and specific tracer accumulation (8.6 ± 1.1 %ID/g) as well as a favorable tumor-to-blood ratio of 11.8.

The length of polyQ tracts is inversely correlated with the risk of prostate cancer, age of onset, and aggressiveness at diagnosis. Aberrant activation of Wnt signaling also reveals frequently in advanced prostate cancer, and an enrichment of androgen and Wnt signaling activation has been observed in African American patients. Here, we assessed aberrant expression of AR bearing different polyQ tracts and stabilized β-catenin in prostate tumorigenesis using newly generated mouse models. We observed an early onset oncogenic transformation, accelerated tumor cell growth, and aggressive tumor phenotypes in the compound mice bearing short polyQ tract AR and stabilized β-catenin. RNA sequencing analysis showed a robust enrichment of Myc-regulated downstream genes in tumor samples bearing short polyQ AR versus those with longer polyQ tract AR. Upstream regulator analysis further identified Myc as the top candidate of transcriptional regulators in tumor cells from the above mouse samples with short polyQ tract AR and β-catenin. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses revealed increased recruitment of β-catenin and AR on the c-Myc gene regulatory locus in the tumor tissues expressing stabilized β-catenin and shorter polyQ tract AR.

In 2018, the FDA issued a safety alert warning that multiple cases of Fournier's Gangrene (FG), a severe genital infection, had been reported in patients taking SGLT2 inhibitors. CASE REPORT We present a case of 72-year-old male with type II diabetes mellitus who developed FG while taking the SGLT2 inhibitor canagliflozin. Besides diabetes and canagliflozin use, his other risk factors were his age, gender, and remote history of radiotherapy for prostate cancer. He presented to the Emergency Department (ED) multiple times complaining of rectal pain and was admitted for a possible diagnosis of prostatitis. During his stay, he developed leukocytosis, his pain worsened, and examination of the perianal area was consistent with FG. He was treated with multiple surgical debridement procedures and broad-spectrum antibiotics; the source of infection was determined to be a perianal abscess. He stayed in the hospital for 1 month and was discharged home with outpatient wound care and vacuum dressing changes. Canagliflozin was discontinued during the hospital stay.

Material and methods:   Ten patient datasets with both a CT and an MRI were planned with opposed lateral proton beams optimized to single field uniform dose under an IRB-approved study. The proton plans were created on CT datasets generated by a commercial synthetic CT-based software called MRCAT (MR for Calculating ATtenuation) routinely used in our clinic for photon-based MR-only planning. A standard prescription of 79.2 Gy (RBE) and 68.4 Gy (RBE) was used for intact prostate and prostate bed cases, respectively. Proton plans were first generated and optimized using the MRCAT synthetic-CT (syn-CT), and then recalculated on the planning CT rigidly aligned with the syn-CT (aligned-CT) and a deformed planning CT (deformed-CT), which was deformed to match outer contour between syn-CT and aligned-CT. The same beam arrangement, total MUs, MUs/spot, spot positions were used to recalculate dose on deformed-CT and aligned-CT without renormalization. DVH analysis was performed on aligned-CT, deformed-CT, and syn-CT to compare D98%, V100%, V95% for PTV, PTVeval, and GTV as well as V70Gy, V50Gy for OARs.  Results:   The relative percentage dose difference between syn-CT and deformed-CT, were (0.17 ± 0.33 %) for PTVeval D98% and (0.07 ± 0.1 %) for CTV D98%.

Results and limitations:   During 22.1yr (median follow-up for survivors=18.6yr; interquartile range: 16.6-20.0), 515 men died; 246 of 346 men (68%) were assigned to surgery versus 269 of 367 (73%) assigned to observation (hazard ratio 0.84 [95% confidence interval {CI}: 0.70-1.00]; p= 0.044 [absolute risk reduction = 5.7 percentage points, 95% CI: -0.89 to 12%]; relative risk: 0.92 [95% CI: 0.84-1.01]). The restricted mean survival in the surgical group was 13.6 yr (95% CI: 12.9-14.3) versus 12.6 yr (95% CI: 11.8-13.3) in the observation group; a mean of 1 life-year was gained with surgery. Results did not significantly vary by patient or tumor characteristics, although differences were larger favoring surgery among men aged <65 yr, of white race, and having better health status, fewer comorbidities, ≥34% positive prostate biopsy cores, and intermediate-risk disease. Results were not adjusted for multiple comparisons, and we could not assess outcomes other than all-cause mortality.  Conclusions:   Surgery was associated with small very long-term reductions in all-cause mortality and increases in years of life gained. Absolute effects did not vary markedly by patient characteristics. Absolute effects and mean survival were much smaller in men with low-risk disease, but were greater in men with intermediate-risk disease although not in men with high-risk disease.  Patient summary:   In this randomized study, we evaluated death from any cause in men with early prostate cancer treated with either surgery or observation. Overall, surgery may provide small very long-term reductions in death from any cause and increases in years of life gained. Absolute effects were much smaller in men with low-risk disease, but were greater in men with intermediate-risk disease although not in men with high-risk disease. Strategies are needed to identify men needing and benefitting from surgery while reducing ineffective treatment and overtreatment.""","""['Timothy J Wilt', 'Tien N Vo', 'Lisa Langsetmo', 'Philipp Dahm', 'Thomas Wheeler', 'William J Aronson', 'Matthew R Cooperberg', 'Brent C Taylor', 'Michael K Brawer']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Eur Urol""","""['Corrigendum to ""Radical Prostatectomy or Observation for Clinically Localized Prostate Cancer: Extended Follow-up of the Prostate Cancer Intervention Versus Observation Trial (PIVOT)"" Eur Urol 77 (2020) 713-24.', 'William Halsted and Prostate Cancer Progression.', 'Re: Radical Prostatectomy or Observation for Clinically Localized Prostate Cancer: Extended Follow-Up of the Prostate Cancer Intervention Versus Observation Trial (PIVOT).', 'Re: Timothy J.

We investigated the efficacy of a dual intervention against EGFR and HER2 to deplete the tumor-initiating cells, optimize the chemotherapy management and prevent the progression of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) cells. Using DU145, PC3, and 22Rv1 CRPC cell lines, biochemical analysis revealed activation of EGFR, HER2, MAPK, and STAT3 in DU145 and 22Rv1, and AKT and SRC in DU145 and PC-3. pSTAT3 nuclear staining was observed in DU145 xenografts and in 12 out of 14 CRPC specimens. The in vivo dual targeting of ErbB receptors with Cetuximab and Trastuzumab combined with chemotherapy caused an effective antitumor response in DU145 xenografted mice displaying STAT3 activation; conversely PC-3 bearing mice experienced tumor relapse. The potentiating of in vivo cytotoxic effect in DU145 model was accompanied by a significant decrease of prostatosphere-forming capacity assessed in vitro on residual tumor cells. Additionally, combined treatment in vitro with Cetuximab, Trastuzumab and chemotherapy negatively affected DU145 and 22Rv1 sphere formation, suggesting the critical function of ErbB receptors for tumor-initiating cells proliferation; no effect on PC-3 clonogenic potential was observed, indicating that other receptors than EGFR and HER2 may sustain PC3 tumor-initiating cells. These findings provided the preclinical evidence that the dual inhibition of EGFR and HER2 by targeting tumor-initiating cells may improve the efficacy of the current chemotherapy regimen, bringing benefits especially to castration-resistant patients with activated STAT3, and preventing disease progression.""","""['Anna Rossini', 'Marta Giussani', 'Francesca Ripamonti', 'Piera Aiello', 'Viola Regondi', 'Andrea Balsari', 'Tiziana Triulzi', 'Elda Tagliabue']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Cancer Biol Ther""","""[""In pancreatic carcinoma, dual EGFR/HER2 targeting with cetuximab/trastuzumab is more effective than treatment with trastuzumab/erlotinib or lapatinib alone: implication of receptors' down-regulation and dimers' disruption."", 'Synergistic antitumor interaction of valproic acid and simvastatin sensitizes prostate cancer to docetaxel by targeting CSCs compartment via YAP inhibition.', 'The stem cell inhibitor salinomycin decreases colony formation potential and tumor-initiating population in docetaxel-sensitive and docetaxel-resistant prostate cancer cells.', 'Multifocal Signal Modulation Therapy by Celecoxib: A Strategy for Managing Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Animal models relevant to human prostate carcinogenesis underlining the critical implication of prostatic stem/progenitor cells.', 'Assessing the Mechanism of Action of ""Fructus Ligustri Lucidi-Cuscutae Semen"" in Prostate Cancer Treatment Using Network Pharmacology and Molecular Docking.', 'Genomic landscape of advanced prostate cancer patients with BRCA1 versus BRCA2 mutations as detected by comprehensive genomic profiling of cell-free DNA.', 'Prostate Cancer Review: Genetics, Diagnosis, Treatment Options, and Alternative Approaches.', 'Improving the detection of aggressive prostate cancer using immunohistochemical staining of protein marker panels.', 'METTL14 promotes prostate tumorigenesis by inhibiting THBS1 via an m6A-YTHDF2-dependent mechanism.']"""

Previous studies reported that long noncoding RNA colon cancer-associated transcript 1 (CCAT1) regulated progression of prostate cancer (PCa). However, the potential role of CCAT1 in the sensitivity of paclitaxel (PTX) in PCa and its mechanism remain largely unknown. The PTX-resistant PCa cells were established in PC3 and DU145 cells by increasing concentrations of PTX. The expressions of CCAT1, microRNA-24-3p (miR-24-3p) and fascin1 (FSCN1) were measured by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. The viability and apoptosis were detected by 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2-H-tetrazolium bromide assay, flow cytometry and western blot, respectively. The interaction among CCAT1, miR-24-3p and FSCN1 was explored by luciferase activity, RNA immunoprecipitation, RNA pull-down and western blot, respectively. Results showed that the expressions of CCAT1 were up-regulated and miR-24-3p was down-regulated in PCa and PTX-resistant PCa cells (PC3-TXR and DU145-TXR). Knockdown of CCAT1 or overexpression of miR-24-3p inhibited survival rate, half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of PTX but increased apoptosis in PC3-TXR and DU145-TXR cells after treatment of PTX. miR-24-3p was bound to CCAT1 and its abrogation reversed knockdown of CCAT1-mediated increase of PTX sensitivity in PC3-TXR and DU145-TXR cells. Moreover, FSCN1 restoration attenuated miR-24-3p-mediated inhibition of PTX resistance. Besides, FSCN1 level was enhanced in PCa and PTX-resistant PCa cells and regulated by CCAT1 and miR-24-3p.

Training and certification for this procedure is performed by the manufacturer, without independent quality measures. We propose a Hydrogel-Implant Quality Score (HIQS) as a surrogate to quantify hydrogel placement accuracy, to assist clinicians in tracking their implant proficiency, and to support quality improvement. A matched-pair study was designed to investigate the benefit of SpaceOAR in rectal dose reduction for low-dose-rate brachytherapy and to validate the principle of the proposed HIQS.  Methods:   Eighty-one prostate patients were retrospectively selected for this study. Each patient had SpaceOAR implantation under manufacturer supervision. Postprocedure computed tomography and T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging were acquired for radiation planning. A HIQS system was proposed to evaluate the hydrogel placement quality. Hydrogel implantation was performed immediately after LDR seed placement. For each LDR patient, a non-SpaceOAR patient was matched based upon intraoperative rectal dose and prostate coverage. Intraoperative and postoperative rectal dose reduction was compared between SpaceOAR and non-SpaceOAR groups.  Results:   The average HIQS was 77 ± 10.8 (range, 49-97). Rectal anatomic distortions were seen in 17 cases. Significant rectal dose reductions between intraoperative and postoperative plans were found for SpaceOAR patients compared with non-SpaceOAR patients (25.1 Gy vs -5.0 Gy for ΔD2cc and 65.7 Gy vs 13.0 for ΔD0.1cc). Additional rectal dose reductions (8.4 Gy for ΔD2cc and 12.7 Gy for ΔD0.1cc) were found for patients without rectal distortion when SpaceOAR was used.  Conclusions:   The proposed HIQS system measured the hydrogel placement quality and provided insights into clinician learning and DVH outcome.

Aberrant Androgen receptor (AR) and PI3K-AKT signaling are very frequent in PCa patients and, therefore, considered as therapeutic targets in the clinic. Sin1 is an essential component of mTORC2 complex, which determines full AKT activation and PCa development in PTEN-/- mice. Here we examined the role of Sin1 in human PCa cell lines and respective tumor samples.  Main methods:   Western blotting and immunohistochemistry (IHC) were performed to analyze the expression of Sin1-mTORC2-AKT related proteins in human PCa cells, as well as prostate tumors and normal tissue counterparts. Cell viability and invasion assays were also pursued in the presence or not of Sin1 in PCa cells. Immunoprecipitation assays were additionally carried out to examine the interaction of Sin1 with AR.  Key findings:   We have presently demonstrated that high levels of Sin1 expression in human PCa tissues correlate with cancer progression. Sin1-mediated cell proliferation and invasion of PCa cells occurs by regulating mTORC2-AKT signaling, epithelial-mesenchymal transition and matrix metalloproteinases. Moreover, androgens are able to induce Sin1 expression, which is further translocated to the nucleus of PCa cells. Finally, Sin1 interacts with AR to suppress its transcriptional activity.  Significance:   Taken together, these data indicate that both Sin1-mediated mTORC2-AKT signaling and Sin1-AR interaction regulate PCa development. Hence, Sin1 may be considered a novel biomarker of PCa progression.""","""['Yunchuanxiang Huang', 'Guanying Feng', 'Jingshu Cai', 'Qian Peng', 'Zhenglin Yang', 'Chunhong Yan', 'Lu Yang', 'Ziyan Wang']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Life Sci""","""['Regulation of androgen receptor transcriptional activity by rapamycin in prostate cancer cell proliferation and survival.', 'G-Protein-Coupled Estrogen Receptor 1 Promotes Gender Disparities in Hepatocellular Carcinoma via Modulation of SIN1 and mTOR Complex 2 Activity.', 'Discrete signaling mechanisms of mTORC1 and mTORC2: Connected yet apart in cellular and molecular aspects.', 'AKT-mediated stabilization of histone methyltransferase WHSC1 promotes prostate cancer metastasis.', 'Role of PI3K-AKT-mTOR Pathway as a Pro-Survival Signaling and Resistance-Mediating Mechanism to Therapy of Prostate Cancer.', 'RAB11A Promotes Cell Malignant Progression and Tumor Formation of Prostate Cancer via Activating FAK/AKT Signaling Pathway.', 'Hepatocellular carcinoma progression mediated by hepatitis B virus-encoded circRNA HBV_circ_1 through interaction with CDK1.']"""

In this study, we investigated the clinical significance of B7-H4 in human PCa and determined if B7-H4 expression is associated with the cancer cell stemness in PCa. Our studies show that expression of B7-H4 is correlated with the pathologic tumor (pT) stage and the clinical stage of PCa.

Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analysis indicated that B7-H4 is an independent poor prognostic factor of PCa. In addition, the expression of B7-H4 is correlated with the cancer cell stemness associated genes expression in PCa. Further, our studies show that B7-H4 regulates cancer cell stemness associated genes expression and effects on the cell cycle and PI3K/Akt signaling related genes expression in PCa.

Here, we reviewed 315 patients scanned with PSMA-PET after curative radiotherapy in the Prostate Cancer Network Amsterdam (2015-2018).

Patients and methods:   Model fit was assessed in a cohort of 550 patients who underwent robot-assisted radical prostatectomy in 2014 to 2017 for prostate cancer. Model calibration was evaluated using calibration slopes. Discriminative ability was quantified using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. Model updating was done by adjusting the linear predictor to minimize differences in expected and observed risk for EPE.  Results:   A total of 792 prostate lobes were included for model validation. Discriminative ability expressed in terms of receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.78, 95%CI 0.75-0.82. Graphical evaluation of the calibration showed poor fit with a high disagreement between predicted probabilities and observed probabilities of EPE in the population. Model updating resulted in excellent agreement between mean predicted and observed probabilities. However, calibration plots showed substantial miscalibration; including both under- and overestimation.  Conclusion:   External validation of the novel nomogram for the prediction of side specific EPE developed by Martini and co-workers showed good discriminative ability but poor calibration. After updating, substantial miscalibration was still present. Use of this nomogram for individualized risk predictions is therefore not recommended.""","""['Timo F W Soeterik', 'Harm H E van Melick', 'Lea M Dijksman', 'Heidi V N Küsters-Vandevelde', 'Douwe H Biesma', 'J A Witjes', 'Jean-Paul A van Basten']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Urol Oncol""","""['Combined Clinical Parameters and Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging for the Prediction of Extraprostatic Disease-A Risk Model for Patient-tailored Risk Stratification When Planning Radical Prostatectomy.', 'Development and External Validation of a Novel Nomogram to Predict Side-specific Extraprostatic Extension in Patients with Prostate Cancer Undergoing Radical Prostatectomy.', 'Development and External Validation of Nomograms To Predict Adverse Pathological Characteristics After Robotic Prostatectomy: Results of a Prospective, Multi-institutional, Nationwide series.', 'Development and internal validation of a side-specific, multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging-based nomogram for the prediction of extracapsular extension of prostate cancer.', 'External Validation of a Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging-based Nomogram for the Prediction of Extracapsular Extension and Seminal Vesicle Invasion in Prostate Cancer Patients Undergoing Radical Prostatectomy.', 'MRI-based nomograms and radiomics in presurgical prediction of extraprostatic extension in prostate cancer: a systematic review.', 'Validation of user-friendly models predicting extracapsular extension in prostate cancer patients.', 'Selection of patients for nerve sparing surgery in robot-assisted radical prostatectomy.', 'Concordance between Preoperative mpMRI and Pathological Stage and Its Influence on Nerve-Sparing Surgery in Patients with High-Risk Prostate Cancer.', 'Explainable artificial intelligence to predict the risk of side-specific extraprostatic extension in pre-prostatectomy patients.']"""

Successful use of these therapies is dependent on the presence or absence of somatic mutations within the patient's tumor that can confer clinical efficacy or drug resistance.  Methods:   The aim of our study was to determine the type, frequency, overlap and functional proteomic effects of potentially targetable recurrent somatic hotspot mutations in 47 cancer-related genes in multiple disease sites that could be potential therapeutic targets using currently available agents or agents in clinical development.  Results:   Using MassArray technology, of the 1300 patient tumors analysed 571 (43.9%) had at least one somatic mutation. Mutations were identified in 30 different genes. KRAS (16.5%), PIK3CA (13.6%) and BRAF (3.8%) were the most frequently mutated genes. Prostate (10.8%) had the lowest number of somatic mutations identified, while no mutations were identified in sarcoma. Ocular melanoma (90.6%), endometrial (72.4%) and colorectal (66.4%) tumors had the highest number of mutations. We noted high concordance between mutations in different parts of the tumor (94%) and matched primary and metastatic samples (90%). KRAS and BRAF mutations were mutually exclusive. Mutation co-occurrence involved mainly PIK3CA and PTPN11, and PTPN11 and APC. Reverse Phase Protein Array (RPPA) analysis demonstrated that PI3K and MAPK signalling pathways were more altered in tumors with mutations compared to wild type tumors.

The purpose of this study was to explore the feasibility of intra-fractional prostate immobilization in reducing toxicity, to promote dose escalation with extreme hypofractionated radiotherapy in prostate cancer.  Material and methods:   207 patients received 5 consecutive fractions of 9 Gy. An air-inflated (150 cm3) endorectal balloon and an intraurethral Foley catheter with 3 beacon transponders were used to immobilize the prostate and monitor intra-fractional target motion. VMAT-IGRT with inverse dose-painting was employed in delivering the PTV dose and in sculpting exposure of normal organs at risk to fulfil dose-volume constraints.  Results:   Introduction of air-filled balloon induced repeatable rectum/prostate complex migration from its resting position to a specific retropubic niche, affording the same 3D anatomical configuration daily. Intra-fractional target deviations ≤1 mm occurred in 95% of sessions, while target realignment in ≥2 mm deviations enabled treatment completion as scheduled.

What is the role of lncRNA PRRT3-AS1 in the regulation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) gene-mediated mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) signalling pathway in proliferation, apoptosis and autophagy of prostate cancer cells? What is the main finding and its importance? The targeting relation between lncRNA PRRT3-AS1 and PPARγ was verified, and it was demonstrated that silencing of lncRNA PRRT3-AS1 can upregulate apoptosis and autophagy yet downregulate proliferation, migration and invasion of prostate cancer cells through the mTOR signalling pathway. Further work is needed to consolidate the therapeutic value of lncRNA PRRT3-AS1 in clinical trials and treatment of prostate cancer.  Abstract:   Although long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are correlated with multiple cancers, their molecular mechanisms in prostate cancer (PC) remain inadequately understood. This study investigated the effects of lncRNA PRRT3-AS1 on the progression of prostate cancer (PC) with involvement of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ). Microarray analysis was used to identify the differentially expressed genes and lncRNAs associated with PC. RT-qPCR and western blot analysis were employed to test the expression of lncRNA PRRT3-AS1, mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signalling pathway-, apoptosis- and autophagy-related genes. A scratch test, Transwell assay, CCK-8 assay, colony formation assay, flow cytometry and monodansylcadaverine staining were employed to identify the migration, invasion, proliferation activity, cell cycle and apoptosis and autophagy of PC3 cells, respectively. Tumorigenicity assays in nude mice were used to detect the tumorigenic ability. GSE55945 and GSE46602 datasets indicated that lncRNA PRRT3-AS1 was highly expressed in PC. PPARγ was predicted as a target gene of lncRNA PRRT3-AS1. Ectopic overexpression of PPARγ or lncRNA PRRT3-AS1 silencing led to inhibited cell viability, migration and invasion, and accelerated apoptosis. Furthermore, the delivery of si-PRRT3-AS1 or PPARγ vector to PC3 cells resulted in the regression of xenografts in nude mice. Based on the in vitro and in vivo experiments, silencing of lncRNA PRRT3-AS1 was observed to activate the PPARγ gene, which in turn could inhibit PC cell proliferation and promote apoptosis and autophagy by blocking the mTOR signalling pathway.""","""['Li Fan', 'Hai Li', 'Weihua Wang']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Exp Physiol""","""['LncRNA DCST1-AS1 accelerates the proliferation, metastasis and autophagy of hepatocellular carcinoma cell by AKT/mTOR signaling pathways.', 'Long non-coding RNA TNRC6C-AS1 promotes methylation of STK4 to inhibit thyroid carcinoma cell apoptosis and autophagy via Hippo signalling pathway.', 'LncRNA RHPN1-AS1 inhibition induces autophagy and apoptosis in prostate cancer cells via the miR-7-5p/EGFR/PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway.', 'lncRNA ZEB2-AS1: A promising biomarker in human cancers.', 'A review of literature: role of long noncoding RNA TPT1-AS1 in human diseases.', 'Importance of long non-coding RNAs in the pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment of prostate cancer.', 'Targeting Autophagy Using Long Non-Coding RNAs (LncRNAs): New Landscapes in the Arena of Cancer Therapeutics.', 'Construction and verification of a novel circadian clock related long non-coding RNA model and prediction of treatment for survival prognosis in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma.', 'Breast Cancer Cells Reprogram the Oncogenic lncRNAs/mRNAs Coexpression Networks in Three-Dimensional Microenvironment.', 'The integration of single-cell sequencing, TCGA, and GEO data analysis revealed that PRRT3-AS1 is a biomarker and therapeutic target of SKCM.']"""

To test this hypothesis, the phase II TRITON2 study of rucaparib included patients with mCRPC and deleterious non-BRCA DDR gene alterations.  Patients and methods:   TRITON2 enrolled patients who had progressed on one or two lines of next-generation androgen receptor-directed therapy and one taxane-based chemotherapy for mCRPC. Key endpoints were investigator-assessed radiographic response per modified RECIST/PCWG3 and PSA response (≥50% decrease from baseline).  Results:   TRITON2 enrolled 78 patients with a non-BRCA DDR gene alteration [ATM (n = 49), CDK12 (n = 15), CHEK2 (n = 12), and other DDR genes (n = 14)]. Among patients evaluable for each endpoint, radiographic and PSA responses were observed in a limited number of patients with an alteration in ATM [2/19 (10.5%) and 2/49 (4.1%), respectively], CDK12 [0/10 (0%) and 1/15 (6.7%), respectively], or CHEK2 [1/9 (11.1%) and 2/12 (16.7%), respectively], including no radiographic or PSA responses in 11 patients with confirmed biallelic ATM loss or 11 patients with ATM germline mutations.

Intensity values are not only highly dependent on acquisition parameters, but also on the subject and body region being scanned. This warrants the need for image normalization techniques to ensure that intensity values are consistent within tissues across different subjects and visits. Many intensity normalization methods have been developed and proven successful for the analysis of brain pathologies, but evaluation of these methods for images of the prostate region is lagging. In this paper, we compare four different normalization methods on 49 T2-w scans of prostate cancer patients: 1) the well-established histogram normalization, 2) the generalized scale normalization, 3) an extension of generalized scale normalization called generalized ball-scale normalization, and 4) a custom normalization based on healthy prostate tissue intensities.

Methods and materials:   Forty-four patients were treated according to a prospective study of single-fraction HDR-brachytherapy. Treatment was delivered using 192Ir to a dose of 19 Gy prescribed to the prostate. Patients who experienced a biochemical failure underwent a re-staging multiparametric MRI (mpMRI) and MRI-TRUS fusion biopsy to rule-out local recurrence. In patients with visible Dominant intraprostatic lesions (DIL) on pretreatment mpMRI, the site of local relapse was compared with the initial site of disease.

Methods and materials:   A consecutive series of 80 patients implanted with stranded I-125 LDR brachytherapy seeds were evaluated, of which 40 underwent a transperineal injection of polyethylene glycol (5 cc) in between the prostate and rectum. Same day CT-based dosimetry was compared between patients with and without hydrogel spacer to evaluate for differences in rectal and prostate dosimetry. Physician-reported toxicities were coded with Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v4.  Results:   Baseline patient and implant characteristics were similar. There were no acute genitourinary or rectal toxicities attributed to the hydrogel spacer.

Myeloid-specific Hdac7 overexpression in transgenic mice amplifies lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-inducible lactate and promotes a glycolysis-associated inflammatory signature. Conversely, pharmacological or genetic targeting of Hdac7 and other class IIa HDACs attenuates LPS-inducible glycolysis and accompanying inflammatory responses in macrophages. We show that an Hdac7-Pkm2 complex acts as an immunometabolism signaling hub, whereby Pkm2 deacetylation at lysine 433 licenses its proinflammatory functions.

LUTS can be in the form of stress urinary incontinence (SUI), urge urinary incontinence (UUI), frequency/urgency, and/or voiding difficulties. While surgery is mostly associated with SUI and radiation mostly results in UUI, there can be an overlap. Incontinence rates after cryotherapy and high intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) are generally very low. Voiding difficulties can also happen after the above-mentioned options. Treatment of SUI can start with pelvic floor muscle exercises (PFME), penile clamps or urethral plugs. If these fail to provide satisfactory results the surgical options could include: urethral bulking agents, male slings, and artificial urinary sphincter (AUS). Surgical options are usually not recommended during the first 6-12 months after radical prostatectomy. Management of frequency, urgency and/or UUI can also be started with lifestyle modifications and PFME. Oral agents (anticholinergics and β3-agonists) are also considered before proceeding to third line options, such as Botox injection or sacral neuromodulation. The treatment options for ED resulting from the treatment of prostate cancer can include oral PDE5-I as the first line, local therapy as the second (such as MUSE, intracavernosal injections, and perhaps low intensity shock wave therapy) and finally surgery as the third line. Standard questionnaires and patient reported outcome measurement tools should be used for the assessment of LUTS and erectile dysfunction prior and after initiation of treatment to guide the management.""","""['Valentin Shabataev', 'Seyed Hossein Saadat', 'Dean S Elterman']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Can J Urol""","""['Urinary and sexual disorders following localised prostate cancer management.', 'Functional results and treatment of functional dysfunctions after radical prostatectomy.', 'Erectile dysfunction and incontinence after prostatectomy.

Most primary PCas inevitably progress into castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) after androgen deprivation therapy. The mechanisms contributing to this progression are still controversial. In this study, functional module genes, DNA methylations, core regulators, and potential drugs in primary PCa and CRPC were explored by integrating a series of bioinformatics analyses. First, 588 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified. Combined with related genes, protein-protein interaction networks were constructed, and 22 and 14 significant modules were identified in primary PCa and CRPC, respectively. More DEGs were identified in differentially methylated genes in CRPC modules. The hub genes in CRPC included CDC20 and CDK1. Moreover, core noncoding RNAs and transcription factors that significantly regulate CRPC modules were identified, including TUG1, MALAT1, E2F3, and MED1. Finally, the prediction of potential drugs for primary PCa and CRPC was also performed. Exisulind and phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitors were predicted as potential drugs for CRPC. The results of this study provide a new way for biologists and pharmacists to understand the potential molecular mechanisms of CRPC and also provide valuable references for drug redirection and new drug development for PCa.""","""['Xiao Liang', 'Kebang Hu', 'Dawei Li', 'Yanbo Wang', 'Min Liu', 'Xiaoxue Wang', 'Wanying Zhu', 'Xinyu Wang', 'Zixuan Yang', 'Ji Lu']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""DNA Cell Biol""","""['CDK6 is upregulated and may be a potential therapeutic target in enzalutamide-resistant castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Identification of PTPRR and JAG1 as key genes in castration-resistant prostate cancer by integrated bioinformatics methods.', 'CCNB1 and AURKA are critical genes for prostate cancer progression and castration-resistant prostate cancer resistant to vinblastine.', 'Androgen receptors in hormone-dependent and castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Androgen receptor: what we know and what we expect in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'CDC20 Is Regulated by the Histone Methyltransferase, KMT5A, in Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Identification of candidate hub genes correlated with the pathogenesis, diagnosis, and prognosis of prostate cancer by integrated bioinformatics analysis.', 'Identification of castration-resistant prostate cancer-related hub genes using weighted gene co-expression network analysis.']"""

Furthermore, pharmacological repression of apoptosis, necroptosis, autophagy or endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress exerted diverse effects on the HMGB1 and HSP70/90 evacuation in NDV/FMW-infected prostate cancer cells. Moreover, ICD markers induced in prostate cancer cells upon NDV/FMW infection, were enhanced by either treatment with a STAT3 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 3) inhibitor or shRNA-mediated knockdown of STAT3. In nude mice bearing prostate cancer cell-derived tumours, the tumours injected with the supernatants of NDV/FMW-infected cells grew smaller than mock-treated tumours.

We examine multivariable associations between the intake of tomatoes and lycopene, and risk of prostate cancer.  Methods:   In a prospective study of 27,934 Adventist men without prevalent cancer, Cox proportional hazard regression analyses were used to address the objectives. Dietary measurement error was partially corrected with regression calibration.  Results:   1226 incident cases of prostate cancer, 355 of them aggressive, were identified during 7.9 years of follow-up. Consumption of canned and cooked tomatoes more than four times a week was associated with a HR = 0.72 (95% CI 0.55, 0.94, P = 0.02) comparing to risk in those never consuming this food. Treating this as a continuous variable, adjusting for confounders, produces a similar result, HR = 0.86 (95% CI 0.75, 0.99), comparing 64 g/day with zero intakes (questionnaire data). Regression calibration, although less precise, suggests a yet stronger and statistically significant inverse relationship, comparing a 24-h dietary recall intake of 71 g/day canned and cooked tomato product, with zero intake. Uncalibrated multivariable-adjusted competing risk analyses do not find differences in tomato associations between aggressive and non-aggressive prostate cancers although power for aggressive cancers is limited.  Conclusion:   Consumption of canned and cooked tomatoes may reduce the risk of prostate cancer. These products contain more available lycopene. However, an observational study cannot exclude confounding by some unidentified, prostate cancer preventive factor.

Methods:   We studied 155 healthy postmenopausal women not taking menopausal hormone therapy enrolled in the Prostate Lung Colorectal and Ovarian (PLCO) screening cancer trial. From a baseline blood draw, we measured endogenous estradiol and 69 inflammation biomarkers: cytokines, chemokines, adipokines, angiogenic factors, growth factors, acute phase proteins, and soluble receptors. We evaluated the estradiol-inflammation relationship by assessing associations across different models (linear, ordinal logistic, and binary logistic) using a variety of estradiol classifications. We additionally investigated the estradiol-inflammation relationship stratified by baseline obesity status (BMI < 30 stratum and BMI > 30 stratum).  Results:   Associations of estradiol with 7 inflammation biomarkers met p < 0.05 statistical significance in linear and ordinal models: C-reactive protein (CRP), adiponectin, chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand-6, thymus activation-regulated chemokine, eosinophil chemotactic protein, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, and serum amyloid A. The positive association between estradiol and CRP was robust to model changes. Each standard deviation increase in endogenous estradiol doubled a woman's odds of having CRP levels higher than the study median (odds ratio 2.29; 95% confidence interval 1.28, 4.09). Estradiol was consistently inversely associated with adiponectin. Other estradiol-inflammation biomarker associations were not robust to model changes.

Western blotting was performed to detect the expression levels of HOXB9 and other related proteins. Cell proliferation was tested by the Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) and cell cycle and apoptosis were investigated by flow cytometry. Angiogenesis was examined using tube formation assays The Transwell assays were carried out to assess the migratory and invasive capacities of cells. Here, we found that HOXB9 knockdown significantly reduced cell proliferation via inducing cell cycle arrest at G1 phase. This treatment also reduced angiogenesis, migration and invasion abilities of PC3 and DU145 cells in vitro.

However, genetic heterogeneity is a major obstacle hindering progress. New strategies and analytic approaches will be necessary to make further advances. One opportunity with the potential to address heterogeneity via improved characterization of disease is the growing availability of multisource databases. Specific to advances involving family-based designs are resources that include family structure, such as the Utah Population Database (UPDB). To illustrate the broad utility and potential power of multisource databases, we describe two different novel family-based approaches to reduce heterogeneity in the UPDB.  Methods:   Our first approach focuses on using pedigree-informed breast tumor phenotypes in gene mapping. Our second approach focuses on the identification of families with similar pleiotropies. We use a novel network-inspired clustering technique to explore multi-cancer signatures for high-risk breast cancer families.  Results:   Our first approach identifies a genome-wide significant breast cancer locus at 2q13 [P = 1.6 × 10-8, logarithm of the odds (LOD) equivalent 6.64]. In the region, IL1A and IL1B are of particular interest, key cytokine genes involved in inflammation. Our second approach identifies five multi-cancer risk patterns. These clusters include expected coaggregations (such as breast cancer with prostate cancer, ovarian cancer, and melanoma), and also identify novel patterns, including coaggregation with uterine, thyroid, and bladder cancers.  Conclusions:   Our results suggest pedigree-informed tumor phenotypes can map genes for breast cancer, and that various different cancer pleiotropies exist for high-risk breast cancer pedigrees.  Impact:   Both methods illustrate the potential for decreasing etiologic heterogeneity that large, population-based multisource databases can provide.See all articles in this CEBP Focus section, ""Modernizing Population Science.""""","""['Heidi A Hanson', 'Claire L Leiser', 'Michael J Madsen', 'John Gardner', 'Stacey Knight', 'Melissa Cessna', 'Carol Sweeney', 'Jennifer A Doherty', 'Ken R Smith', 'Philip S Bernard', 'Nicola J Camp']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev""","""['Harnessing Population Pedigree Data and Machine Learning Methods to Identify Patterns of Familial Bladder Cancer Risk.', 'Confirmation of the HPCX prostate cancer predisposition locus in large Utah prostate cancer pedigrees.', 'Utah Population Database: a tool to study the hereditary element of nonsyndromic neurosurgical diseases.', 'Utah family-based analysis: past, present and future.', 'Significant evidence for a heritable contribution to cancer predisposition: a review of cancer familiality by site.', 'Deep Transcriptome Profiling of Multiple Myeloma Using Quantitative Phenotypes.', 'Geographic Proximity of Family Members and Healthcare Utilization After Complex Surgical Procedures.', 'Duo Shared Genomic Segment analysis identifies a genome-wide significant risk locus at 18q21.33 in myeloma pedigrees.', 'Shared genomic segment analysis in a large high-risk chronic lymphocytic leukemia pedigree implicates CXCR4 in inherited risk.', 'Charting the life course: Emerging opportunities to advance scientific approaches using life course research.']"""

We demonstrate a novel approach to simultaneously assess risks for multiple cancers to identify distinct multicancer configurations (multiple different cancer types that cluster in relatives) surrounding patients with familial bladder cancer.  Methods:   This study takes advantage of a unique population-level data resource, the Utah Population Database (UPDB), containing vast genealogy and statewide cancer data. Familial risk is measured using standardized incidence risk (SIR) ratios that account for sex, age, birth cohort, and person-years of the pedigree members.  Results:   We identify 1,023 families with a significantly higher bladder cancer rate than population controls (familial bladder cancer). Familial SIRs are then calculated across 25 cancer types, and a weighted Gower distance with K-medoids clustering is used to identify familial multicancer configurations (FMC). We found five FMCs, each exhibiting a different pattern of cancer aggregation. Of the 25 cancer types studied, kidney and prostate cancers were most commonly enriched in the familial bladder cancer clusters. Laryngeal, lung, stomach, acute lymphocytic leukemia, Hodgkin disease, soft-tissue carcinoma, esophageal, breast, lung, uterine, thyroid, and melanoma cancers were the other cancer types with increased incidence in familial bladder cancer families.

Predicting these QOL outcomes based on personalized features is necessary.  Objective:   To create an easy-to-use tool to predict personalized sexual, urinary, bowel, and hormonal function outcomes after RP, RT, and AS.  Design, setting, and participants:   A prospective, population-based cohort study was conducted utilizing US cancer registries of 2563 men diagnosed with localized prostate cancer in 2011-2012.  Intervention:   Patient-reported urinary, sexual, and bowel function up to 5 yr after treatment.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Patient-reported urinary, sexual, bowel, and hormonal function through 5 yr after treatment were collected using the 26-item Expanded Prostate Index Composite (EPIC-26) questionnaire. Comprehensive models to predict domain scores were fit, which included age, race, D'Amico classification, body mass index, EPIC-26 baseline function, treatment, and standardized scores measuring comorbidity, general QOL, and psychosocial health. We reduced these models by removing the instrument scores and replacing D'Amico classification with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and Gleason score. For the final model, we performed bootstrap internal validation to assess model calibration from which an easy-to-use web-based tool was developed.  Results and limitations:   The prediction models achieved bias-corrected R-squared values of 0.386, 0.232, 0.183, 0.214, and 0.309 for sexual function, urinary incontinence, urinary irritative, bowel, and hormonal domains, respectively. Differences in R-squared values between the comprehensive and parsimonious models were small in magnitude. Calibration was excellent. The web-based tool is available at https://statez.shinyapps.io/PCDSPred/.  Conclusions:   Functional outcomes after treatment for localized prostate cancer can be predicted at the time of diagnosis based on age, race, PSA, biopsy grade, baseline function, and a general question regarding overall health.

Although previous studies have documented substantial heterogeneity in the uptake of conservative management, less is known about the underlying reason for this variation and whether it is due to guideline-concordant factors (age, race, and biopsy cancer volume). We explored variation in the use of conservative management for low-risk prostate cancer among 20 597 men diagnosed in the US Veterans Affairs health care system from 2010 to 2016. Conservative management increased substantially over this time from 51% to 76% (p< 0.001). However, there was substantial variation by facility (35-100%). Multivariable analysis revealed that patient factors included in the guidelines (e.g., age and biopsy cores), other patient factors (eg, marital status and PSA) and non-patient factors (eg, geographic region, case volume, year) were associated with conservative management use. In conclusion, even within an integrated health care system, there remains significant heterogeneity in the uptake of conservative management for low-risk prostate cancer. Both guideline-concordant factors and other factors not discussed in the guidelines were associated with conservative management use.

Inferring diseases associated lncRNAs by computational methods can be helpful to understand the pathogenesis of diseases, but those current computational methods still have not achieved remarkable predictive performance: such as the inaccurate construction of similarity networks and inadequate numbers of known lncRNA-disease associations. In this research, we proposed a lncRNA-disease associations inference based on integrated space projection scores (LDAI-ISPS) composed of the following key steps: changing the Boolean network of known lncRNA-disease associations into the weighted networks via combining all the global information (e.g., disease semantic similarities, lncRNA functional similarities, and known lncRNA-disease associations); obtaining the space projection scores via vector projections of the weighted networks to form the final prediction scores without biases. The leave-one-out cross validation (LOOCV) results showed that, compared with other methods, LDAI-ISPS had a higher accuracy with area-under-the-curve (AUC) value of 0.9154 for inferring diseases, with AUC value of 0.8865 for inferring new lncRNAs (whose associations related to diseases are unknown), with AUC value of 0.7518 for inferring isolated diseases (whose associations related to lncRNAs are unknown).

The BMEG system provides a graph query-based application programming interface to enable analysis, with client code available for Python, Javascript, and R, and a server online at bmeg.io. Using this system, we have demonstrated several forms of cross-data set analysis to show the utility of the system.  Conclusion:   The BMEG is an evolving resource dedicated to enabling integrative analysis. We have demonstrated queries on the system that illustrate mutation significance analysis, drug-response machine learning, patient-level knowledge-base queries, and pathway level analysis. We have compared the resulting graph to other available integrated graph systems and demonstrated the former is unique in the scale of the graph and the type of data it makes available.""","""['Adam Struck', 'Brian Walsh', 'Alexander Buchanan', 'Jordan A Lee', 'Ryan Spangler', 'Joshua M Stuart', 'Kyle Ellrott']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""JCO Clin Cancer Inform""","""['Algorithms for effective querying of compound graph-based pathway databases.', 'EpiGeNet: A Graph Database of Interdependencies Between Genetic and Epigenetic Events in Colorectal Cancer.', 'GenoLink: a graph-based querying and browsing system for investigating the function of genes and proteins.', 'Using CellMiner 1.6 for Systems Pharmacology and Genomic Analysis of the NCI-60.', 'Bioinformatics Tools and Resources for Cancer Immunotherapy Study.', 'Graphery: interactive tutorials for biological network algorithms.', 'Informatics Tools for Cancer Research and Care: Bridging the Gap Between Innovation and Implementation.']"""

Late-stage Suzuki couplings produced Me2dppn ligands substituted at the 10 and 15 positions with phenyl (5), 2,4-dimethylphenyl (6), and 2,4-dimethoxyphenyl (7) groups. Complexes of the general formula [Ru(tpy)(L)(py)](PF6)2 (8-10), where L = 4-7, were characterized and shown to have dual photochemotherapeutic (PCT) and photodynamic therapy (PDT) behavior. Quantum yields for photodissociation of monodentate pyridines from 8-10 were about 3 times higher than that of parent complex [Ru(tpy)(Me2dppn)(py)](PF6)2 (1), whereas quantum yields for singlet oxygen (1O2) production were ∼10% lower than that of 1. Transient absorption spectroscopy indicates that 8-10 possess long excited state lifetimes (τ = 46-50 μs), consistent with efficient 1O2 production through population and subsequent decay of ligand-centered 3ππ* excited states. Complexes 8-10 displayed greater lipophilicity relative to 1 and association to DNA but do not intercalate between the duplex base pairs. Complexes 1 and 8-10 showed photoactivated toxicity in breast and prostate cancer cell lines with phototherapeutic indexes, PIs, as high as >56, where the majority of cell death was achieved 4 h after treatment with Ru(II) complexes and light. Flow cytometric data and rescue experiments were consistent with necrotic cell death mediated by the production of reactive oxygen species, especially 1O2.

In this application, we describe a simple and novel method for templating amino-functionalized RNA onto Au surfaces and their self-assembly into small, discrete nanoparticles. In our method, sample hybridization with a complementary RNA strand with and without a fatty acid (palmitamide) appendage produced functionalized double-stranded RNA on the Au surface. The resulting Au-functionalized RNA particles were found to be stable under reducing conditions according to UV-Vis spectroscopy. Sample characterization by DLS and TEM confirmed self-assembly into primarily small (∼10-40 nm) spherical shaped nanoparticles expected to be amenable to cell biology. However, fluorescence emission (λexc: 350 nm, λem: 650 nm) revealed radiative properties which limited cell uptake detection. Introduction of FITC within the Au-functionalized RNA particles produced a bifunctional probe, in which FITC fluorescence emission (λexc: 494 nm, λem: 522 nm) facilitated cell uptake detection, in a time-dependent manner. The dual encapsulation-release profiles of the FITC-labeled Au-functionalized RNA particles were validated by time-dependent UV-Vis spectroscopy and spectrofluorimetry. These experiments respectively indicated an increase in FITC absorption (λabs: 494 nm) and fluorescence emission (λem: 522 nm) with increased sample incubation times, under physiological conditions. The release of Au-functionalized siRNA particles in prostate cancer (PC-3) cells resulted in concomitant knockdown of GRP75, which led to detectable levels of cell death in the absence of a transfection vector. Thus, the formulation of stable, small and discrete Au-functionalized RNA nanoparticles may prove to be valuable bifunctional probes in the theranostic study of cancer cells.""","""['Sunil S Shah', 'Christopher N Cultrara', 'Jorge A Ramos', 'Uri Samuni', 'Jenny Zilberberg', 'David Sabatino']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""J Mater Chem B""","""['Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen Targeted Gold Nanoparticles for Theranostics of Prostate Cancer.', 'PSMA-targeted melanin-like nanoparticles as a multifunctional nanoplatform for prostate cancer theranostics.', 'Cell Membrane-Inspired Polymeric Vesicles for Combined Photothermal and Photodynamic Prostate Cancer Therapy.', 'Current Biomedical and Diagnostic Applications of Gold Micro and Nanoparticles.', 'Nanosystem functionalization strategies for prostate cancer treatment: a review.', 'High Stability Au NPs: From Design to Application in Nanomedicine.', ""Mitochondrial and Organellar Crosstalk in Parkinson's Disease.""]"""

The aim of this study was to measure IL-33 quantities and genetic alterations in the rs1929992 SNP within IL-33 gene in patients with prostate cancer (PC).  Methods:   This investigation was conducted on blood specimens from 150 newly diagnosed PC patients and 150 healthy age-matched controls. Serum IL-33 measurements and genotyping were performed by ELISA and PCR-RFLP, respectively.  Results:   Elevated IL-33 quantities were detected in PC patients compared with controls (P < 0.001). The PC patients with Gleason scores 7-10 displayed greater IL-33 quantities than those who had Gleason scores 1-6 (P < 0.001). Significant differences were found between PC stages regarding the IL-33 serum levels (P < 0.001). The frequencies of the genotype GG and allele G in rs1929992 SNP were higher, whereas the frequencies of the genotype AA and allele A were lower in PC patients, as compared with controls (P < 0.05, 0.01, P < 0.002 and P < 0.01, respectively). The genotype GG and allele G of rs1929992 SNP were associated with a greater risk of cancer development (OR: 4.533; P < 0.001, and OR: 1.516; P < 0.01, respectively). The IL-33 levels were not significantly different between the subjects carrier genotypes AA, AG and GG, or alleles A and G in rs1929992 SNP, neither in patients nor in controls.  Conclusion:   Higher IL-33 quantities were found in patients with PC, especially in those with greater stages which raises the possiblity that IL-33 may contribute to PC progression.

This includes an AR-null non-neuroendocrine phenotype of metastatic castrate resistant prostate cancer which may be less sensitive to androgen receptor signaling inhibitors. This AR-null non-neuroendocrine phenotype is thought to be associated with TP53 and RB1 alterations. Herein, we have correlated molecular profiling of metastatic castrate resistant prostate cancer with AR/P53/RB immunohistochemistry and relevant clinical correlates.  Design:   Twenty-seven cases of metastatic castrate resistant prostate cancer were evaluated using histopathologic examination to rule out neuroendocrine differentiation. A combination of a hybridization exon-capture next-generation sequencing-based assay (n = 26), fluorescence in situ hybridization for AR copy number status (n = 16), and immunohistochemistry for AR (n = 27), P53 (n = 24) and RB (n = 25) was used to profile these cases.  Results:   Of 27 metastatic castrate resistant prostate cancer cases, 17 had AR amplification and showed positive nuclear expression of AR by immunohistochemistry. Nine cases lacked AR copy number alterations using next-generation sequencing/fluorescence in situ hybridization. A subset of these metastatic castrate resistant prostate cancer cases demonstrated the AR-null phenotype by immunohistochemistry (five cases and one additional case where next-generation sequencing failed). Common co-alterations in these cases involved the TP53, RB1, and PTEN genes and all these patients received prior therapy with androgen receptor signaling inhibitors (abiraterone and/or enzalutamide).  Conclusions:   Our study suggests that AR immunohistochemistry may distinguish AR-null from AR-expressing cases in the metastatic setting. AR-null status informs clinical decision-making regarding continuation of therapy with androgen receptor signaling inhibitors and consideration of other treatment options.

Survivin (BIRC5) gene expression was increased in primary prostate cancers and metastases, but did not differ in recurrent vs non-recurrent prostate cancers. Survivin immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining was limited exclusively to the nucleus in 900 prostate cancers (40.0%), and accompanied by various levels of cytoplasmic positivity in 1338 tumors (59.4%). 0.5% of prostate cancers did not express survivin. Nuclear and cytoplasmic survivin staining intensities were strongly associated with each other, pT category, and higher Gleason scores. Cytoplasmic but not nuclear survivin staining correlated with high tumor cell proliferation in prostate cancers. Strong cytoplasmic survivin staining, but not nuclear staining predicted an unfavorable outcome in univariate analyses. Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that survivin is not an independent prognostic marker. In conclusion, we provide evidence that survivin expression is increased in prostate cancers, especially in metastatic disease, resulting in higher aggressiveness and tumor progression.

The detection of recurrence and monitoring of symptoms and long-term side-effects in prostate cancer survivors requires the active involvement of GPs in their follow-up care. In order to address this, the transition and discharge from hospital to primary care must be managed effectively. The objective of this study was to examine the preparedness, concerns and experiences of GPs in relation to their role in providing follow-up care to prostate cancer survivors. Purposive sampling was used to recruit GPs with experience in providing care to prostate cancer survivors. Twenty semi-structured telephone interviews were conducted with GPs across England. The interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim and analysed using thematic analysis. Participants described their current role in the follow-up pathway, a number of challenges and barriers in assuming this role, and potential ways to resolve these and improve their involvement. They expressed a range of views about their preparedness and willingness to take over follow-up care after discharge for this group of patients. GPs had reservations about workload, lack of resources, expertise and deficiencies in communication with hospitals. Findings from this study suggest that GPs will be ready to take over the follow-up care of prostate cancer survivors if better information, additional training and adequate resources are provided and communication lines with hospital specialists are clear.

The apoptosis studies confirm the inhibition of cell proliferation with morphological changes like cell shrinkage, blebbing and cell wall deformation, increasing the ROS levels, and loss of mitochondrial membrane potential by Acridine orange/Ethidium bromide staining, Hoechst-33342 staining, H2DCFDA staining, annexin V-FITC/PI, and JC-1 staining methods. In flow cytometric analysis, 7q selectively arrested the sub-G1 phase of the cell cycle in a dose-dependent manner. In Gal-1 ELISA studies, compound 7q efficiently reduced the levels of Gal-1 protein in dose-dependent manner with an IC50 value of 100 µM. The binding constant (Ka) of 7q with Gal-1 was observed as 1.3 × 104 M-1 by fluorescence spectroscopy. The molecular docking studies clearly showed possible interactions and the pharmacokinetic (ADMET) properties of compound 7q with Gal-1. Hence, the novel 4, 7-disubstituted coumarins could be a potential cytotoxic and PET imaging agents via Gal-1.""","""['Nerella Sridhar Goud', 'Venkata Krishna Kanth Makani', 'Jakkula Pranay', 'Ravi Alvala', 'Insaf A Qureshi', 'Pardeep Kumar', 'Rose Dawn Bharath', 'Chandana Nagaraj', 'Suresh Yerramsetty', 'Manika Pal-Bhadra', 'Mallika Alvala']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Bioorg Chem""","""['Novel benzimidazole-triazole hybrids as apoptosis inducing agents in lung cancer: Design, synthesis, 18F-radiolabeling & galectin-1 inhibition studies.', 'Synthesis and Biological Evaluation of Novel Heterocyclic Imines Linked Coumarin- Thiazole Hybrids as Anticancer Agents.', 'Synthesis and biological evaluation of morpholines linked coumarin-triazole hybrids as anticancer agents.', 'Coumarins as Potential Anti-drug Resistant Cancer Agents: A Mini Review.', 'Coumarin derivatives with anticancer activities: An update.', 'Therapeutic Effects of Coumarins with Different Substitution Patterns.', 'Plantaricin BM-1 decreases viability of SW480 human colorectal cancer cells by inducing caspase-dependent apoptosis.', 'HPLC Study of Product Formed in the Reaction of NBD-Derived Fluorescent Probe with Hydrogen Sulfide, Cysteine, N-acetylcysteine, and Glutathione.', 'PET Molecular Imaging in Drug Development: The Imaging and Chemistry Perspective.']"""

Matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) is directly involved in the degradation of the extracellular matrix, and basement membrane components promote cancer cell migration and invasion. There is a functional interaction among FAK, MMP-9 and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which leads to enhanced cancer angiogenesis, cancer cell invasion and progression of malignancy. FAK, MMP-9, VEGF and CD34-positive microvessel density (MVD) were examined in 100 patients with prostate adenocarcinoma using immunohistochemistry. The relationship among these proteins and their impact on angiogenesis and clinicopathological parameters were also evaluated. The FAK expression was found to be positively correlated with the Gleason score, WHO grade group, tumour stage, extracapsular extension and perineural invasion. The MMP-9 expression was positively correlated with the WHO grade group, tumour stage, extracapsular extension, positive surgical margin and lymphovascular and perineural invasion. The FAK expression was also positively correlated with MMP-9 expression and MVD. However, no correlation between FAK and VEGF expression was identified. The MMP-9 expression was positively correlated with FAK expression and MVD. Strong MMP-9 expression was associated with shorter disease-free survival. These results suggest that strong MMP-9 and FAK expressions play an essential role in the progression of prostate adenocarcinoma.

We sought to clarify whether higher magnesium intake from diet and supplements was associated with lower risks of PLC incidence and mortality in the US population. Magnesium intake from diet and supplements was evaluated through a food frequency questionnaire in a cohort of 104,025 participants. Cox regression was employed to calculate hazard ratios for PLC incidence and competing risk regression was employed to calculate subdistribution hazard ratios for PLC mortality. Restricted cubic spline regression was employed to test nonlinearity. We documented 116 PLC cases during 1,193,513.5 person-years of follow-up and 100 PLC deaths during 1,198,021.3 person-years of follow-up. Total (diet + supplements) magnesium intake was found to be inversely associated with risks of PLC incidence (hazard ratiotertile 3 vs. 1 : 0.44; 95% confidence interval: 0.24, 0.80; ptrend = 0.0065) and mortality (subdistribution hazard ratiotertile 3 vs. 1 : 0.37; 95% confidence interval: 0.19, 0.71; ptrend = 0.0008). Similar results were obtained for dietary magnesium intake. Nonlinear inverse dose-response associations with PLC incidence and mortality were observed for both total and dietary magnesium intakes (all pnonlinearity < 0.05). In summary, in the US population, a high magnesium intake is associated with decreased risks of PLC incidence and mortality in a nonlinear dose-response manner.

Participants and methods:   A trizonal biopsy technique was used to evaluate 75 men with small Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) 3-5 MRI lesions (<15 mm) identified from a prospective cohort of 290 men undergoing multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for suspected prostate cancer at a single high-volume institution between September 2017 and May 2019. In addition to target and systematic biopsies, near-target biopsies were taken 4 mm from the apparent border of the MRI lesion. Comparisons were made between highest International Society of Urological Pathology grade and longest tumour length.  Results:   Fifty-three men with significant prostate cancer in the same quadrant as the target were included in the final analysis. The percentages of positive cores from target, near-target and MRI-negative zones were 66%, 39% and 17%, respectively. Significant cancer was detected in the near-target zone in 77% of cases when the target zone was positive. A total of 17% of participants were upgraded by a median (range) of 1 (1-3) grades through the addition of near-target cores.

However, the role of ELK3 in prostate cancer cells and its mechanism are not fully understood. The contribution of ELK3 to prostate cancer progression was investigated in the present study. We showed that silencing of ELK3 by siRNA in prostate cancer cell DU145 induced S-M phase arrest, promoted apoptosis, inhibited cell proliferation and migration in vitro, and suppressed xenograft growth in mice in vivo. In accordance with its ability to arrest cells in S-M phase, the expression of cyclin A and cyclin B was downregulated. In addition, the expression of p53 was upregulated following ELK3 knockdown, while that of antiapoptotic Bcl-2 was decreased. The migration inhibition may partly due to upregulation of SERPINE1 (a serine protease inhibitor) followed ELK3 knockdown. Consistently, downregulation of SERPINE1 resulted in a modest elimination of migration inhibition resulted from ELK3 knockdown. Furthermore, we found that the AKT signaling was activated in ELK3 knockdown cells, and treatment these cells with AKT inhibitor attenuated SERPINE1 expression induced by ELK3 silencing, suggesting that activation of AKT pathway may be one of the reasons for upregulation of SERPINE1 after ELK3 knockdown.

Sixty to seventy percent of prostate cancer or benign prostatic hyperplasia patients are over the age of 65, while prostatitis is likely to occur in men under 45 years. MicroRNAs currently represent a class of distinctive biological indicators to be used for clinical disease diagnosis and treatment monitoring. This study aims to identify microRNAs that could serve as potential biomarkers for prostate disorders induced by elevated E levels according to their altered expression in prostate or plasma.  Materials and methods:   Groups of Sprague Dawley rats (offspring) were dosed with estradiol benzoate (EB) on postnatal days 1, 3, and 5, and subcutaneously implanted with tubes containing testosterone (T)/E on postnatal day 90. Expression levels of prostate and plasma microRNAs were evaluated using microRNA microarray and validated via qRT-PCR. The expression levels of the potential targeted genes of a set of identified microRNAs were also examined by qRT-PCR.  Results:   Postnatal administration of EB, T, and E elevated serum E levels with decreased serum T levels in rats. Chronic inflammation was observed in the dorsolateral prostate. Significant changes in expression levels of several microRNAs (rno-miR-146-5p, rno-miR-329-3p, and rno-miR-126a-3p) in the dorsolateral prostate and of a microRNA (rno-miR-329-3p) in the plasma were found in the dosed rats. The target gene expression levels of the altered microRNAs also changed accordingly.  Conclusion:   Chronic inflammation in the dorsolateral prostate of rats dosed with EB, T, and E resulted in deregulated expression in a set of microRNAs whose target genes were related to tumor growth or abnormal proliferation.

Results:   Of 11,440 patients, 10,342 (90.4%) were discharged on postoperative days 0-2; 80.6% (887/1101) of patients with PLOS did not experience any perioperative complications.

Logistic regression identified predictors of PLOS as age, race, wound class, American Society of Anesthesiologists class, smoking, diabetes, dyspnea, dependent functional health status, congestive heart failure, operative time, and pelvic lymph node dissection. Results of this regression were insensitive to the exclusion of patients who experienced no perioperative complications.

However, there is still an unmet need for the validation of PSMA PET/CT at primary staging and consecutive histological correlation. Consequently, we decided to analyze the prediction parameter of PSMA PET/CT at primary staging.  Methods:   We relied on 90 ≥ intermediate-risk PCa patients treated with radical prostatectomy (RP) and extended pelvic lymph node dissection. All patients were administered to 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT prior to surgery. 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT data were retrospectively reevaluated by a single radiologist and consequently compared to histological results from RP. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) for the detection of lymph node metastases were analyzed per-patient (n = 90), per-pelvic side (n = 180), and per-anatomic-region (external iliac artery and vein left/right vs. obturator fossa left/right vs. internal iliac artery left/right) (n = 458), respectively.

Genome-scale metabolic network models have been used successfully to simulate cancer metabolic networks. However, most models use bulk gene expression data of entire tumor biopsies, ignoring spatial heterogeneity in the TME. To account for spatial heterogeneity, we performed spatially-resolved metabolic network modeling of the prostate cancer microenvironment. We discovered novel malignant-cell-specific metabolic vulnerabilities targetable by small molecule compounds. We predicted that inhibiting the fatty acid desaturase SCD1 may selectively kill cancer cells based on our discovery of spatial separation of fatty acid synthesis and desaturation. We also uncovered higher prostaglandin metabolic gene expression in the tumor, relative to the surrounding tissue. Therefore, we predicted that inhibiting the prostaglandin transporter SLCO2A1 may selectively kill cancer cells.

We conducted a nested case-control study in the Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial (PCPT). Cases (n = 1,128) and controls (n = 1,205) were frequency matched on age, first-degree relative with prostate cancer, and PCPT treatment arm (finasteride/placebo); African-Americans were oversampled and case/control status was biopsy confirmed. We selected 21 SNPs in vitamin D-related genes (VDR, GC, C10orf88, CYP2R1, CYP24A1, CYP27B1, DHCR7, and NADSYN1) to test genotype and genotype-treatment interactions in relation to prostate cancer. We also tested mean serum 25(OH)D differences by minor allele distributions and tested for serum 25(OH)D-genotype interactions in relation to prostate cancer risk. Log-additive genetic models (Bonferroni-corrected within genes) adjusted for age, body mass index, PSA, and family history of prostate cancer revealed a significant interaction between treatment arm and GC/rs222016 (finasteride OR = 1.37, placebo OR = 0.85; P interaction < 0.05), GC/rs222014 (finasteride OR = 1.36, placebo OR = 0.85; P interaction < 0.05), and CYP27B1/rs703842 (finasteride OR = 0.76, placebo OR = 1.10; P interaction < 0.05) among Caucasians, and C10orf88/rs6599638 (finasteride OR = 4.68, placebo OR = 1.39; P interaction < 0.05) among African-Americans. VDR/rs1544410 and CYP27B1/rs703842 had significant treatment interactions for high-grade disease among Caucasians (finasteride OR = 0.81, placebo OR = 1.40; P interaction < 0.05 and finasteride OR = 0.70, placebo OR = 1.28; P interaction < 0.05, respectively). Vitamin D-related SNPs influenced serum 25(OH)D, but gene-serum 25(OH)D effect modification for prostate cancer was marginally observed only for CYP24A1/rs2248359. In conclusion, evidence that vitamin D-related genes or gene-serum 25(OH)D associations influence prostate cancer risk is modest. We found some evidence for gene-finasteride interaction effects for prostate cancer in Caucasians and African-Americans. Results suggest only minimal associations of vitamin D with total or high-grade prostate cancer.""","""['Kathleen Torkko', 'Cathee Till', 'Catherine M Tangen', 'Phyllis J Goodman', 'Xiaoling Song', 'Jeannette M Schenk', 'M Scott Lucia', 'Ulrike Peters', 'Adrie van Bokhoven', 'Ian M Thompson', 'Marian L Neuhouser']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Cancer Prev Res (Phila)""","""['Vitamin D-related genes, serum vitamin D concentrations and prostate cancer risk.', 'Comprehensive association analysis of the vitamin D pathway genes, VDR, CYP27B1, and CYP24A1, in prostate cancer.', 'Genetic variants in CYP2R1, CYP24A1, and VDR modify the efficacy of vitamin D3 supplementation for increasing serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels in a randomized controlled trial.', 'Polymorphisms in VDR, CYP27B1, CYP2R1, GC and CYP24A1 Genes as Biomarkers of Survival in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer: A Systematic Review.', 'Vitamin D gene pathway polymorphisms and risk of colorectal, breast, and prostate cancer.', 'How competing risks affect the epidemiological relationship between vitamin D and prostate cancer incidence?

This study aims to explore the biological function and the profound regulative mechanism of CTHRC1 in human prostate cancer (PCa). We found that CTHRC1 was upregulated in patients with PCa. The knockdown of CTHRC1 suppressed PCa cell proliferation, invasion, migration, and colony formation significantly. The expression of CTHRC1 was down-regulated and up-regulated by miR-30e-5p mimics and inhibitors, respectively, in PCa cells. The dual-luciferase reporter assay validated the binding of miR-30e-5p with CTHRC1 mRNA, indicating the regulation of CTHC1 by miR-30e-5p. In consequence, this study demonstrated that CTHRC1 acts as an oncogenic gene and targeting the miR-30e-5p-CTHRC1 axis may provide novel therapeutic treatment for PCa.""","""['Zhe Ma', 'Fan Chao', 'Shiyu Wang', 'Zhenyu Song', 'Zhiyuan Zhuo', 'Jinguo Zhang', 'Guoxiong Xu', 'Gang Chen']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Biochem Biophys Res Commun""","""['CTHRC1, a novel gene with multiple functions in physiology, disease and solid tumors (Review).', 'Collagen triple helix repeat containing-1 negatively regulated by microRNA-30c promotes cell proliferation and metastasis and indicates poor prognosis in breast cancer.', 'Micro-RNA-186-5p inhibition attenuates proliferation, anchorage independent growth and invasion in metastatic prostate cancer cells.', 'Mir-30b-3p affects the migration and invasion function of ovarian cancer cells by targeting the CTHRC1 gene.', 'The Role of CTHRC1 in Regulation of Multiple Signaling and Tumor Progression and Metastasis.', 'CTHRC1, a novel gene with multiple functions in physiology, disease and solid tumors (Review).', 'Anticancer function of microRNA-30e is mediated by negative regulation of HELLPAR, a noncoding macroRNA, and genes involved in ubiquitination and cell cycle progression in prostate cancer.', 'Application of collagen triple helix repeat containing-1 and mitotic spindle apparatus antibody in small cell lung cancer diagnosis.', 'The effect and mechanism of miR-30e-5p targeting SNAI1 to regulate epithelial-mesenchymal transition on pancreatic cancer.', 'Potential of miRNAs in urinary extracellular vesicles for management of active surveillance in prostate cancer patients.']"""

A Case Control Study""","""Aim:   There is much evidence of an association between cancer and irisin that is an adipokine. This study researched on the relationship between prostate cancer (PCa) and irisin levels, and whether irisin can be used as a biomarker in the diagnosis of PCa.  Materials and methods:   For the study groups, 50 primary PCa patients and 30 healthy male subjects were included in the PCa and healthy control groups, respectively. All volunteers in the healthy control group were screened for prostate cancer and other malignancies and chronic diseases. Volunteers who were determine to be completely healthy were included for healthy control group. In the serum samples of the subjects were measured free PSA, total PSA and irisin levels. Irisin levels were compared separately in terms of the Gleason scores and T stage. In addition to intergroup comparisons, the ROC curve for the irisin was plotted and power analysis was performed.  Results:   Free and total PSA levels in the PCa group were significantly higher compared to the healthy control group (p<0.05). In addition, irisin levels in the PCa group were significantly lower than in the healthy control group (p<0.05). There was no significant difference between irisin levels in the groups classified in terms of Gleason scores (p>0.05). When the cut-off value was taken as 8.1, the sensitivity and specificity of irisin for PCa were as 80.5% and 90%, respectively.  Conclusion:   The results of this study indicate that the levels of irisin in the PCa group are considerably reduced and irisin may be used as a biomarker as well as free and total PSA.""","""['Rahmi Aslan', 'Hamit Hakan Alp', 'Recep Eryılmaz', 'Zubeyir Huyut', 'Mehmet Sevim', 'Şeyhmuz Araz', 'Kasim Ertas', 'Kerem Taken']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Asian Pac J Cancer Prev""","""['Additional value of the ratio of serum total testosterone to total prostate-specific antigen in the diagnosis of prostate cancer in a Chinese population.', 'LacdiNAc-Glycosylated Prostate-specific Antigen\xa0Density is a Potential Biomarker of Prostate\xa0Cancer.', 'Diagnosis of Prostate Cancer in Patients with Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA) in the Gray Area: Construction of 2 Predictive Models.', 'Identification of Multisialylated LacdiNAc Structures as Highly Prostate Cancer Specific Glycan Signatures on PSA.', 'Comparison Between the Four-kallikrein Panel and Prostate Health Index for Predicting Prostate Cancer.', 'The Modulation of Adipokines, Adipomyokines, and Sleep Disorders on Carcinogenesis.', 'Low FNDC5/Irisin expression is associated with aggressive phenotypes in gastric cancer.', 'Implication of Irisin in Different Types of Cancer: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.', 'The Relationship between Circulating Irisin and Oxidative Stress in Gastric and Colorectal Cancer Patients.', 'The Impact of Lifestyle on Prostate Cancer: A Road to the Discovery of New Biomarkers.']"""

The objective of the study was to study the PR expression in patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia and prostate cancers in connection with the transcription, growth factors, AR, ERα, ERβ, and components of the AKT/mTOR signaling pathway expression.  Materials and methods:   Ninety-seven patients with prostate pathology were enrolled in the study. Forty-two patients had benign prostatic hyperplasia (BH). Fifty-five patients had locally advanced prostate cancer (PCa). The PSA level and the amount of testosterone in the serum were measured using an ELISA assay. The expression level of NF-κB p65, NF-κB p50, HIF-1, HIF-2, growth factor VEGF, VEGFR2, CAIX, as well as AR, ERα, ERβ, PR, Brn-3α, TRIM16 were quantified by RT-PCR. The protein level of Brn-3α, TRIM16 was detected by Western Blotting.  Results:   Growth in PR expression was observed in PCa tissues compared to BH ones without changes in the clinical and pathological features of the patients. An increase in PR expression was detected in patients with PCa compared to BH. Its mRNA level depended on the expression of AR, Brn-3α, and TRIM16, components of the AKT/mTOR signaling pathway, transcription, and growth factors. An increase in the TRIM16 expression in the PCa tissues was noted in the case of a low PR level. We revealed the growth in PR expression was accompanied by the suppression of the signaling cascade activity, AR, Brn-3α mRNA level, and the enhanced PTEN expression in PCa tissues. The increase in PR expression in PCa led to a decrease in the level of mRNA of NF-κB, HIF-1, VEGF, and VEGFR2.  Conclusion:   In general, the data indicated the significance of the PR expression in the development of the prostate pathology that affected the cross-talk between the steroid hormone reception and signal transduction. <br />.""","""['Liudmila V Spirina', 'Irina V Kovaleva', 'Evgeny A Usynin', 'Alexey K Goorbunov', 'Irina V Kondakova']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Asian Pac J Cancer Prev""","""['VHL Expression in Kidney Cancer: Relation to Metastasis Development, Transcription and Growth Factors and Component of Akt/m-TOR Signaling Pathway.', 'Reception of Sex Steroid Hormones in Thyroid Papillary Cancer Tissue and Relationship with Expression and Content of Transcription Factors Brn-3α and TRIM16.', 'Methylation and inactivation of estrogen, progesterone, and androgen receptors in prostate cancer.', 'Progesterone receptor in the prostate: A potential suppressor for benign prostatic hyperplasia and prostate cancer.', 'Role of PI3K-AKT-mTOR Pathway as a Pro-Survival Signaling and Resistance-Mediating Mechanism to Therapy of Prostate Cancer.', 'Dietary Progesterone Contributes to Intratissue Levels of Progesterone in Male Mice.']"""

Therefore, new natural agents with anticancer potential should be examined and the response of existing therapeutic drugs must be enhanced. Stevia pilosa and Stevia eupatoria are two species that have been widely used in traditional medicine, but their effectiveness on cancer cells and their interaction with antineoplastic drugs have not been studied. The aim of this study was to evaluate the anticancer activity of Stevia pilosa methanolic root extract (SPME) and Stevia eupatoria methanolic root extract (SEME) and their effect, combined with enzalutamide, on prostate cancer cells. Materials and Methods: The study was conducted on a human fibroblast cell line, and on androgen-dependent (LNCaP) and androgen-independent (PC-3) prostate cancer cell lines. The cell viability was evaluated using a Trypan Blue exclusion test for 48 h, and the migration by a wound-healing assay for 24, 48, and 72 h. Results: The results indicate that SPME and SEME were not cytotoxic at concentrations less than 1000 μg/mL in the human fibroblasts. SPME and SEME significantly reduced the viability and migration of prostate cancer cells in all concentrations evaluated. The antiproliferative effect of the Stevia extracts was higher in cancer cells than in normal cells. The enzalutamide decreased the cell viability in all concentrations tested (10-50 µM). The combination of the Stevia extracts and enzalutamide produced a greater effect on the inhibition of the proliferation and migration of cancer cells than the Stevia extracts alone, but not of the enzalutamide alone. Conclusion: The results indicate that SPME and SEME have an inhibitory effect on the viability and migration of prostate cancer cells and do not interfere with the enzalutamide anticancer effect. The data suggest that Stevia extracts may be a potential source of molecules for cancer treatment.""","""['Elizabeth Martínez-Rojo', 'Raquel Cariño-Cortés', 'Laura Cristina Berumen', 'Guadalupe García-Alcocer', 'Jesica Escobar-Cabrera']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Medicina (Kaunas)""","""['Antimutagenicity of Stevia pilosa and Stevia eupatoria evaluated with the Ames test.', 'Anticancer potential of Thevetia peruviana fruit methanolic extract.', 'In Vitro Anticancer Properties of Table Grape Powder Extract (GPE) in Prostate Cancer.', 'The determination of the potential anticancer effects of Coriandrum sativum in PC-3 and LNCaP prostate cancer cell lines.', 'In vitro anti-prostate cancer and ex vivo antiangiogenic activity of Vernonia guineensis Benth.
